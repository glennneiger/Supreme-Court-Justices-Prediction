justice
souter
mr.
schafer,
i
have
two
questions
that
your
answer
raises.
the
first
is
if
the
doctors
themselves
and
the
doctors
alone
had
brought
action
under
the
statute,
i
think
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
they
indeed
would
have
a
separate
and
independent
cause
of
action
to
bring
under
this
statute.
is
that
your
position?
justice
souter
in
other
words,
you
could
put
them
in
the
same
position
as
the
republicans
who
were
referred
to
as
being
one
of
the
class
to
be
protected
by
the
statute
at
the
time
it
was
passed.
kind
of
an
ancillary
category
which
essentially
gets
its
foot
in
the
door
by
being
ancillary
to
a
primarily
protected
category.
justice
souter
i'm
sorry.
my
second
question
goes
back
to
mr.
roberts'
answer
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
johnson
controls.
his
response
was
that
the...
i
think
was
that
the
class
at
johnson
controls
was
the
class
of
those
who
were
fertile,
and
i
guess
in
the
broad
sense
of
being
able,
being
capable
of
engaging
in
the
reproductive
act.
and
the
distinction
was
made
between
women
in
that
category
and
men
in
that
category.
do
you
think
that's
a
proper
answer
to
your
claim
that
johnson
supports
you?
justice
souter
didn't
the
court
also
point
out
that
men
were
not
required,
in
fact,
to
make
this
election
that
women
were?
justice
souter
don't
you
go
beyond
griffin
when
you
characterize
one
possible
sufficient
proposition
that
it
would
be
enough
to
prove
that
the
conspirators
would
render
the
travel
useless?
griffin
didn't
go
that
far,
did
it?
didn't
griffin
require
a
proof
either
that
the
travel
as
such
would
be
prevented
or
that
individuals
would
be
precluded
from
associating
with
those
who
did
travel
interstate?
justice
souter
well,
doesn't
the
answer
lie
in
the
fact
that
to
the
extent
that
interstate
travel
would
be
rendered
useless,
so
would
intrastate
travel
be
rendered
useless.
and
griffin,
whether
with
precision
or
not,
tried
to
center
on
the
peculiarity
of
the
inter,
interstate
travel
and
the
right
to
exercise
it.
justice
souter
--i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
isn't
the
finding
that
you
rely
on
a
finding
of
impact,
i.e.,
a
high
percentage
of
people
who
come
to
this
clinic
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
defendants
knew
it.
isn't
that
a
finding
about
impact,
rather
than
a
finding
about...
certainly
it's
not
a
finding
directly
about
purpose.
do
you
have
anything
more
than
that?
justice
souter
i
think
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
what
you
are
saying
is
the
purpose
finding
is
essentially
an
impact
finding.
