ms.
deborah
ellis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
like
the
black
students
in
little
rock
in
1957
who
faced
angry
mobs
as
they
walked
up
to
the
entrance
of
integrated
schools,
the
women
in
this
case,
many
of
whom
came
from
other
states
to
falls
church,
virginia,
faced
angry,
intimidating
mobs
who
physically
obstructed
their
freedom
of
movement,
blocking
streets,
parking
lots,
entrances,
and
exits.
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
issue
that
arises
infrequently
but
is
vitally
important:
whether
federal
law...
federal
law
prohibits
a
mob
from
nullifying
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
class.
section
1985(3)
was
enacted,
as
representative
shellabarger
explained
in
1871,
to
provide
a
remedy
against
conspirators
who
trampled
into
dust
the
newly
acquired
political
rights
of
the
freedmen.
this
court's
section
1985(3)
jurisprudence
has
strived
both
to
give
effect
to
congressional
intent
and
to
avoid
making
the
statute
into
a
federal
tort
law.
far
from
being
mere
torts,
the
acts
of
petitioners
here
are
part
of
a
nationwide
systematic
conspiracy
to
use
force
to
deny
women
in
america
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
to
do
precisely
what
congress
sought
to
prevent
in
enacting
section
1985(3).
all
of
the
four
elements
that
this
court
has
required
to
make
out
a
section
1985(3)
claim
were
proved
here--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--well,
your
honor,
in
scott
this
court
held
that
that
kind
of
class-based
animus
is
not
cognizable
under
1985(3).
ms.
deborah
ellis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
in
this
court--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
in
scott,
this
court
recognized
that
animus
against
union
activities
or
economic
classes
are
not
sufficient
to
form
a
class
under
1985(3).
here--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--okay,
assuming
that
this
court
has
held
that
antiunion
animus
is
sufficient
to
form
a
class,
then
i
do
believe
that
blocking
people
from
an
activity
that
only
that
group
can
engage
in
does
suffice
to
prove
class-based
animus,
especially
when
the
right
they
seek
to
block
is
a
constitutional
right
of
a
class,
an
important
constitutional
right
that
only
that
class
has,
and
especially
as
in
this
case,
when
this
court
recently
recognized
in
planned
parenthood
v.
casey
that
that
right
is
necessary
in
order
for
that
class
to
be
equal
citizens.
in
this
case,
the
two
elements
of
the
conspiracy...
of
section
1985(3)
are
not
at
issue,
the
conspiracy
and
the
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
although
there's
no
dispute
about
those
elements,
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
mob
characteristics
of
this
case
are
particularly
important.
congress
enacted
section
1985(3),
called
the
ku
klux
klan
act,
because
it
understood
that
mobs
could
deprive
individuals
of
rights
in
a
way
that
single...
single
individuals
cannot.
the
petitioners
here,
who
operate
systematically
in
large
groups
nationwide,
are
a
much
closer
analog
to
the
ku
klux
klan
than
the
two
conspirators
that
this
court
recognized
could
violate
section
1985(3)
in
griffin,
for
example.
because
there's
no
dispute
about
the
conspiracy
in
the
act,
i
will
focus
on
the
other
two
elements,
that
the
conspiracy
be
motivated
by
class-based
animus,
and
here,
that
the
independent
right,
the
right
to
travel,
be
violated.
to
begin
with
class-based
animus,
we
must
first
show
that
women
are
a
protected
class,
and
indeed,
neither
the
petitioners
nor
the
solicitor
general
dispute
that
women
are
a
class
under
1985(3).
the
broad
text
and
legislative
history
of
section
1985(3)
dictate
that
conclusion.
instead,
petitioners
and
the
government
argue
that
here
only
a
subset
of
women
are
affected.
that
subset
distinction
is
false.
discrimination
usually
occurs
against
the
subset
of
a
class
that
is
exercising
its
rights.
for
example,
those
who
blocked
african-american
citizens
from
entering
integrated
schools
targeted
only
some
citizens
but
demonstrated
invidious
racial
animus
against
an
entire
class.
the
requirement
of
class-based
animus
was
created
by
this
court
in
griffin
v.
breckenridge
in
order
to
prevent
section
1985(3)
from
becoming
a
federal
tort
law.
animus
should
not
be
confused
with
personal
malice
or
hostility,
especially
because
much
of
discrimination
against
women
throughout
history
has
been
benign.
more
specifically,
womens'
reproductive
capacity
has
served
as
the
benign
rationale
to
deny
women
a
host
of
equal
opportunities,
as
this
court
has
recognized
many
times,
most
recently
in
johnson
controls
and
in
casey.
respondents
admit
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
class-based
animus.
in
most
situations,
the
conspirators
deny
to
the
class
a
right
that
is
available
to
all,
but
here
there
is
class-based
animus
for
a
different
reason:
because
petitioners
engaged
in
unlawful
behavior
that
denies
a
right
that
is
available
only
to
the
class.
this
case
is
a
particularly
strong
example
of
class-based
animus,
as
i
was
saying
before,
because
a
right
blocked
here
has
been
judicially
recognized
to
be
indispensable
for
the
equality
of
the
class.
if
equal
protection
of
the
law
means
anything,
it
must
encompass
knowing
behavior
to
take
away
a
liberty
right
that
only
the
protected
class
has.
in
casey,
this
court
recognized
that
abortion
is
a
unique
act,
and
that
women
must
have
control
over
their
reproductive
lives
in
order
to
be
equal
and
autonomous
citizens.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
think
that
would
show
class-based
animus--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--if...
yes,
your
honor,
although
i
don't
think
that
a
ruling
in
this
case
would
need
to
reach
that
precise
conclusion,
because
in
this
case
we're
only
asking
the
court
to
recognize
that
class-based
animus
is
present
when
a
constitutional
right
is
taken
away.
so--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--uh-huh.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
change
the
hypothetical.
i
do
agree
that--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--they
are
depriving
indians
of
a
right
that
only
that
class
has.
class-based
animus
would
be
present.
this
court
has
not
required
personal
malice
or
hostility.
for
example,
the
segregationists
were
blocking
the
entrance
to
an
integrated
school,
and
doing
that
because
they
opposed
the
activity
of
integration,
not
because
they
opposed
blacks
as
a
class.
i
believe
this
court
would
find
class-based
animus.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
if
a
class
has...
if
there's
a
constitutional
right
that
only
that
class
has,
that
that
must
violate
equal
protection
to
take
away
that
right.
now,
of
course,
in
the
fishing
hypothetical,
the
class
there
is
not
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
they're
exercising
only
an
activity
that
that
class
wishes
to
engage
in.
this
court
does
not
need
to
go
that
far
in
answering
this
case.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
a
class
such
as
women
or
african-american
citizens
trying
to
get
into
an
integrated
school
exercising
a
fund...
an
important
constitutional
right,
and
in
this
particular
case,
a
constitutional
right
that
the
joint
opinion
in
casey
recognized
is
crucial
for
women
to
be
equal
and
autonomous
citizens.
ms.
deborah
ellis
no,
your
honor,
many
segregationists
say
that
they
oppose
not
the
black
race,
but
they
oppose
the
activity
of
integration,
and
even
if
they
said
that
they
loved
the
class
but
opposed...
physically
obstructed
the
entrance
of
black
children
into
central
high
in
little
rock,
i
believe
this
court
should
find
class-based
animus
there,
as
it
should
here.
i
believe
that
taking
away
a
right
that
only
that
class
has
must
violate
the
animus
requirement
for
section
1985(3).
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
geduldig
to
argue
that
no
class-based
animus
exists.
geduldig
was
decided
in
1974
when
this
court's
gender-based
equal
protection
standard
was
still
evolving.
geduldig
differs
dramatically
from
this
case,
because
there
the
court
was
asked
to
interpret
the
constitution
to
provide
mandatory
benefits.
as
recognized
by
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
1977
nashville
gas
company
v.
satty
decision,
geduldig
by
its
own
terms
is
limited
to
cases
dealing
with
the
distribution
of
benefits,
not
the
imposition
of
burdens.
here,
women
are
asking
for
statutory
protection
from
the
complete
denial
of
their
rights,
and
they
are
not
seeking
any
monetary
or
other
benefits.
as
this
court
recently
reaffirmed
in
casey,
the
denial
of
womens'
reproductive
rights
denies
women
the
ability
to
control
their
destiny.
turning
to
the
right
to
travel,
the
independent
right
violated
here,
the
right
to
travel
here
was
violated
in
the
most
blatant
way
possible...
by
actual,
physical
obstruction
of
movement.
griffin
is
the
only
other
case
where
this
court
has
addressed
the
right
to
travel
under
section
1985(3).
the
facts
here
track
the
unanimous
decision
of
griffin
in
three
important
ways,
and
in
one
way
this
case
is
much
stronger
than
griffin.
first,
in
both
cases
the
defendants
physically
obstructed
travel,
although
not
at
a
state
border.
here,
in
griffin,
there
was
a
single
episode
of
obstruction
of
travel
on
a
public
highway.
here,
there
was
a
pattern
of
blockades
at
a
clinic
in
falls
church,
virginia,
less
than
10
miles
from
the
d.c.
and
maryland
borders.
the
court
below
found
that
petitioners
engaged
in
the
conspiracy,
as
justice
stevens
noted
before,
for
the
purpose,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
of
depriving
women
of
the
right
to
travel.
second,
in
griffin
the
court
remanded
to
determine
if
there
had
been
actual
or
intended
interstate
travel.
and
here
there
was
a
factual
finding
by
the
court
that
a
substantial
number
of
respondents,
in
fact,
engaged
in
interstate
travel.
as
the
griffin
case
came
to
this
court,
there
was
very
little
evidence
of
interstate
travel.
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
that
case,
which
was
filed
on
behalf
of
those
people
who
had
been
deprived
of
their
rights,
noted
in
footnote
6
that
they
believed
there
had
been
no
allegations
of
interference
with
interstate
travel.
that
is
why
this
court,
in
griffin,
allowed
the
plaintiffs
on
remand
to
elect...
to
prove
some
connection
with
interstate
travel
in
a
variety
of
ways.
ms.
deborah
ellis
the
solicitor
general,
in
that
case,
took
the
side
of
the
black
plaintiffs
who
had
been
beaten
up.
ms.
deborah
ellis
they
did,
your
honor.
and
they
said
in
that
case
that
equal
protection
of
the
laws
should
be
interpreted
broadly
to...
even
if
interstate
travel
wasn't
violated,
that
because
the
plaintiffs
there
had
been
beaten
up,
their
equal
protection
of
the
laws
had
been
violated.
third,
in
both
griffin
and
this
case,
the
defendants
blocked
the
travel,
not
because
they
cared
about
the
travel
per
se,
as
we
had
said
last
time,
but
because
they
wanted
to
stop
the
activities
the
plaintiffs
were
traveling
for.
in
griffin
it
was
civil
rights
activities,
and
here
it
was
to
exercise
the
right
to
privacy.
so
this
case
tracks
griffin
in
the
three
ways
of
physical
obstruction,
actual
interstate
travel,
and
the
fact
that
in
both
cases
the
people
were
traveling
in
order
to
exercise
other
constitutional
rights.
significantly,
however,
this
case
is
stronger
than
griffin
because
in
griffin
there
were
only
two
conspirators,
and
here
there
was
a
mob.
and
as
i've
mentioned
before,
congress
was
particularly
concerned,
in
enacting
section
1985(3),
about
the
fact
that
mobs
could
deprive
individuals
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
in
a
way
that
a
sole
person
cannot.
nonetheless,
the
solicitor
general
insists
that
respondents
are
opening
a
pandora's
box
because,
he
argues,
there's
no
showing
that
petitioners
purposefully
interfered
with
respondents'
right
to
travel.
well
here,
of
course,
petitioners
did
physically
block
respondents'
right
to
travel.
there
can
be
no
more
blatant
obstruction
of
the
right
of
travel.
in
this
court's...
in
most
of
this
court's
other
travel
cases,
such
as
shapiro
v.
thompson,
there
is
no
direct
interference
with
the
right
to
travel.
only
in
griffin
and
in
this
case
was
there
physical
obstruction.
the
petitioners...
the
solicitor
general's
argument
can
be
accepted
only
if
this
court
takes
an
unnaturally
narrow
view
of
the
right
to
travel
under
section
1985(3)
so
that
it
is
only
violated
when
the
defendants
block
only
interstate
travelers,
and
when
they
block
them
with
the
sole
purpose
to
prevent
crossing
straight...
state
lines.
that
was
not
the
case
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
griffin
v.
breckenridge,
and
yet
this
court
held
the
right
to
travel
could
be
violated.
this
case
is
on
all
fours
with
griffin.
ms.
deborah
ellis
it
was
not
an
issue,
your
honor,
because
they
inferred
the
animus
from
the
fact
that
they
beat
them
up.
there
was...
in
griffin
in
note
10,
the
court
said
that
animus
should
not
be
confused
with
scienter.
ms.
deborah
ellis
and
that
also
should
not--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--that
was...
that
purpose
was
inferred
from
the
fact
that
they
beat
them
up.
ms.
deborah
ellis
they
did
not
say
that
they
hated
blacks.
ms.
deborah
ellis
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
ellis
your
honor--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
petitioners'
purpose
is
to
stop
the
activity
of
abortion.
abortion
is
a
constitutional
right
of
a
class
of
women.
that
is
the
same
as
petitioners'...
if
petitioners'
were
trying
to
block
an
integrated
school,
trying
to
block
an
activity
that
is
a
constitutional
right
of
black
citizens.
in
doing
that,
they
would
also
block
other
people
coming
into
the
school;
they
would
block
the
teachers
and
block
parents,
custodians,
just
as
here
petitioners
block
others
coming
into
the
abortion
clinic.
nevertheless,
it
is
clear
that
the
animus
is
directed
towards
women.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
that
is
a
proper
analog.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
think--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--i
think
if
the
segregationists
in
little
rock
said
that
our
object
is
to
block
anyone
from
going
into
this
integrated
school
because
the
school
is
integrated,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
class-based
animus.
in
fact,
i
think
many
segregationists
did
try
to
do
that.
they
didn't
want
anyone
going
into
those
integrated
schools.
ms.
deborah
ellis
that's
right.
ms.
deborah
ellis
that's
right.
and
here
they're
blocking
because
they
don't--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--that's
right,
your
honor.
and
it's
exactly
parallel.
there
they
did
not
want
the
class
to
exercise
their
constitutional
right
to
an
integrated
education.
here,
they
do
not
want
the
class
to
exercise
their
constitutional
right
to
an
abortion.
ms.
deborah
ellis
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
problem
is
it's
always
difficult
to
define...
to
divine
the
actual
malice
or
animosity
that
is
motivating
someone.
that's
why
the
court
said
in
griffin
that
the
class-based
animus
requirement
should
not
be
confused
with
a
requirement
of
personal
hostility.
we
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
heart
of
the
segregationists.
all
we
know
is
that
they
tried
to
block
a
constitutional
right
that
that
class
has.
similarly,
we
do
not
know
what
is
in
the
heart
of
petitioners,
but
we
do
know
that
they
have
a
conceded
purpose
to
block
women
from
exercising
a
constitutional
right.
while
we
believe
that
the
violation
of
the
right
to
travel
is
clearly
sufficient
to
justify
the
injunction
below,
there
are
three
other
ways
this
injunction
can
be
sustained.
first,
respondents
made
a
privacy
claim
which
was
not
ruled
on
the
court...
ruled
on
by
the
courts
below.
second,
section
1985(3)
jurisdiction
is
also
sustained
by
petitioners'
avowed
purpose
to
hinder
and
prevent
local
authorities
from
enforcing
the
law,
in
violation
of
the
second
clause
of
section
1985(3),
a
claim
which
is
proved
below,
but
not
fully
briefed.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
that
you
posed
to
opposing
counsel.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
trial
testimony
has
shown
that
between
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
and
the
time
of
the
trial,
that
a
blockade
occurred
at
a
maryland
clinic.
and
at
that
clinic
the
police
could
not
guarantee
safe
passage
to
the
patients
who
tried
to
get
into
the
clinic,
even
though
they
had
called
on
all
the
resources
of
the
county
and
the
state
police.
ms.
deborah
ellis
of
hindrance?
the
issue
of
hindrance,
your
honor,
was
proved
below,
but
it
was
not
fully
briefed.
ms.
deborah
ellis
no,
your
honor.
the
complaint
is
alleged,
though,
a
violation
of
section
1985(3)
generally.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i'm
sorry.
it
was
proved
below.
the
evidence
showed
a
hindrance
of
the
state
police,
of
the
local
police.
ms.
deborah
ellis
well,
the
findings...
there
were
findings,
not
specifically
directed
towards
a
hindrance
claim,
but
there
were
findings--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--that's
right.
ms.
deborah
ellis
no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor.
however,
your
honor,
we
do
believe
that
under
rule
15(b),
the
pleadings,
of
course,
are
amended
to
conform
with
the
evidence,
and
that
this
question,
should
the
court
choose
to
reach
it,
is
fairly
subsumed
within
the
fourth
circ...
question
here,
which
was
was
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
substantial
enough
to
justify
the
injunction.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
think,
your
honor,
the
more
appropriate
case...
the
more
appropriate
course
in
this
instance
would
be
to
remand
for
full
briefing
on
hindrance.
but
i
do
believe
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
should
the
court
want
to
address
that
question.
finally,
even
if
none
of
the
section
1985(3)
claims
ultimately
prevail
on
their
merits--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--your
honor--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--i
think
at
the
minimum
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
briefing...
i'm
sorry,
for
a
decision
on
the
privacy
claim,
which
was
alleged
and
briefed,
but
never
addressed
by
either
of
the
courts
below.
here--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--no,
your
honor,
the
court
decided
not
to
reach
that
claim.
it
discussed
it--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--it
did
say
it
was
problematic,
but
it
decided
not
to
adjudicate--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--pardon?
ms.
deborah
ellis
mm-hum,
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
in
any
case
that
there
is
enough...
that
the
hindrance
and
the
privacy
claims
are
substantial
enough
so
that
jurisdiction
exists
and
the
injunction
could
be
sustained
on
the
pending
state
law
claims
which
the
court
found
to
be
violated.
ms.
deborah
ellis
your
honor,
we
have
reconsidered
our
position
on
that.
ms.
deborah
ellis
we
have
reconsidered
our
position
on
that.
ms.
deborah
ellis
that's
right,
we
did,
your
honor,
and
on
reflection
we
have
reconsidered
our
position
on
that.
we
believe
that
there
are
strong
reasons
that
class-based
animus
should
not
be
required
for
the
hindrance
claim
because
the
class-based
animus
requirement
was
created
by
this
court
in
griffin
out
of
concern
for
not
federalizing
section
1985(3)
into
a
tort
law.
those
same
concerns
do
not
exist
with
the
hindrance
claim,
and
we
would
say
that
this
is
more
like
kush
v.
rutledge,
the
case
where
this
court
found
no
requirement
of
class-based
animus
for
section
1985(2),
and
in
kush
this
court
also
emphasized
that
in
griffin
the
court
was
only
addressing
the
clause
of
section
1985(3)--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--that's
right,
your
honor,
but
that
was
proved
at
trial.
there
was
actually
evidence
in
the
record
showing
that
one
of
their
exhibits
asked
to
have
thousands
of...
1,000
or
1,500
people
come
because
when
that
many
people
come
there
are
too
many
people
for
the
police
to
arrest--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--well,
your
honor,
in
footnote
4
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
court
talked
about
how
the
activities
of
petitioners
overwhelmed
the
falls
church
police
department
and
talked
about
a
specific
example.
ms.
deborah
ellis
right,
and
there
is
evidence--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--there's
no
finding
on
that.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
though,
to
support
that
finding.
for
the
little
children
in
little
rock,
this
court
said
in
cooper
v.
aaron
that
the
vitality
of
constitutional
principles
cannot
be
allowed
to
yield
simply
because
of
disagreement
with
them.
congress
enacted
section
1985(3)
so
that
the
mob
no
more
than
the
state
could
nullify
constitutional
rights.
like
the
plaintiffs
in
griffin,
women
here
invoke
the
core
coverage
of
section
1985(3)
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
exercise
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
protection
of
the
rule
of
law.
thank
you.
ms.
deborah
ellis
it
was
a
permanent
injunction
that
expired
at
a
definite
time.
it
has
since
been
extended
on
five
separate
occasions
and
now
is
set
to
expire
on
january
8,
1993.
ms.
deborah
ellis
it
was.
the
trial
court
consolidated
the
hearing...
the
final
hearing
with
a
preliminary
hearing.
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
an
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
and
so
i
don't
think
bribing
a
policeman
would
come
under--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--right.
ms.
deborah
ellis
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
hindrance
should
apply
to
acts
that
attempt
to
take
away
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
by
hindering
the
local
authorities.
it
cannot
just
apply
to
bribing
a
policeman.
the
statute
requires
both--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--that
is
clearly
not
what
congress
was
concerned
about--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--in
enacting
section
1985(3).
ms.
deborah
ellis
i
think
the
best
way
to
avoid
that
is
to
require
that
you
be
hindering
the
police
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
federal
constitutional
rights,
just
as
this
court
has
required
a
violation
of
the
independent
right
under
the
first
clause
of
1985(3).
i
think
that
you'd
also
want
to
make
sure
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
federal
constitutional
rights,
which
i
think
is
well-supported
by
the
text
of--
ms.
deborah
ellis
--well,
i
think
that
either
would
be
an
acceptable
course
for
this
court.
ms.
deborah
ellis
this
court
has
so
far
only
specifically
protected
federal
constitutional
rights
under
1985(3).
that,
of
course,
is
an
open
question.
