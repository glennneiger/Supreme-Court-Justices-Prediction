justice
scalia
is
it
your
point
that
a
group
who
perform
a
particular
activity
cannot
qualify
as
a
group
for
purposes
of
the
invidious
discrimination
necessary?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
why
couldn't
you
oppose,
let's
say
you
have
an
animus
against
all
people
who
oppose
the...
oppose
the
war
in
kuwait,
or
who
opposed
world
war
ii,
or
whatever,
why
isn't
that
a
group?
justice
scalia
of
course,
mr.
sekulow,
it's
sort
of
hard
to
parse
the
statute
too
closely,
isn't
it,
because
even
the
requirement
for
any
class-based
animus
is
not
to
be
found
in
this
statute,
is
it?
justice
scalia
if
there's
any
person
or
class
of
persons,
and
we've
rather
made
up
the
requirement
that
there
has
to
be
a
class-based
animus.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
doesn't
say
that
classes.
it
says
any
person
or
class
of
persons.
justice
scalia
mr.
schafer,
your
position
is
that
that
hinder
claim
does
not
require
any
class-based
animus.
justice
scalia
oh,
it
does.
justice
scalia
because
otherwise,
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
if
it
doesn't
require
class-based
animus,
then
i
suppose
you
would
have
had
to
apply
that
clause
to
the
freedom
riders
who
went
to
the
south
in
massive
numbers
violating
trespass
laws
in
the
south,
making
it
impossible--
justice
scalia
--you
wouldn't
assert
that
it
would
apply
to
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
but
that's
not
true.
the
losers
are
not
all
women.
surely
the
doctors
who
want
to
make
a
living
performing
abortion
are
deprived
of
their
right
to
engage
in
that
specialty.
they
are
kept
out
of
the
clinics,
as
well
as
the
women,
are
they
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
does
it
not
violate
a
right
of
theirs,
or
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
right.
so
it
is
not
directed
just
against
the
rights
of
women.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
of
women
to
choose
to
have
an
abortion,
but
likewise
the
right
of
a
physician
to
choose
to
give
an
abortion.
i
gather
their
animus
against
those
who
perform
the
abortion
is
the
same
as
their
animus
against
those
who
receive
it.
justice
scalia
mr.
schafer,
the
courts
below
didn't
rely
on...
rely
on
the
right
to
an
abortion,
but
the
right
to
interstate
travel,
as
the
federal
right
or
privilege
that
was
taken
away.
justice
scalia
what
would
be
your
response
to
the
hypothetical
that
was
given
to
opposing
counsel,
if
there...
i
think
by
justice
stevens...
if
there
is
picketing
of
an
airport,
let's
assume
the
employees
of
an
airport
picket
unlawfully,
it's
trespassory
picketing
or
something,
would
they
be
suable
under
1985(3)?
justice
scalia
you
would
have
to
show
class-based--
justice
scalia
--okay.
justice
scalia
they
would
not
be
liable
simply
because
they
know
that
some
people's
interstate
travel
will
be
affected.
justice
scalia
even
if
they
do
it
to
such
a
degree
that
the
police
cannot
enforce
the
law?
justice
scalia
would
you
explain
to
me
why
the
class
is
all
women
and
not
just
women
seeking
abortion?
i
must
say
i
don't
follow.
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
justice
scalia
you
could
say
you're
depriving
a
right
of
human
beings,
too,
if
you
want
to
go
up
to
the
next
generality.
but
the
fact
is
the
narrowest
class
affected
is
simply,
is
pregnant
women,
not
all
women.
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
so
as
far
as
blocking
the
current
entrance
to
the
facility
is
concerned.
justice
scalia
mr.
schafer,
it
isn't
just
that
is
a
violation,
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
them
of
that
privilege.
that
has
to
be
the
purpose.
the
purpose
is
to--
justice
scalia
--for
the
purpose
of
the
depriving,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
any
person
under
the
equal
protection,
or
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws.
justice
scalia
now
here
we're
talking
about
the
privilege
of
interstate
travel.
justice
scalia
so
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
them
of
that
privilege.
is
that
not
right?
justice
scalia
suppose
i
kill
somebody
who
i
know
is
on
the
way
to
the
railroad
station,
and
he's
going
to
be,
you
know,
going
to
another
state.
am
i
interfering
with
his
right
to
interstate
travel
for
the
purpose
of
this
provision?
i
mean,
i
know
for
a
sure
thing
that
if
i
kill
him
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
take
the
train
and
go
to
the
next
state.
and
he
has
a
ticket
in
his
pocket.
i
know
that
the
effect
is
going
to
be
to
prevent
that
travel.
have
i
violated
1985(3)?
justice
scalia
all
right,
let's
assume
it's
invidiously
discriminatory.
suppose
i
kill
him
because
he's
black
and
i
don't
like
blacks,
and
i
kill
him
and
also
know
that
he
has
in
his
pocket
a
railroad
ticket,
and
that
i'm
going
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
another
state.
justice
scalia
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
him
of
the
privilege
of
interstate
travel.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
words
for
the
purpose
mean.
i
mean,
language
no
longer
means
anything
anymore
if
that
was
for
the
purpose
of--
justice
scalia
mr.
schafer,
can
i
ask...
i
mean,
the
most
important
relief
here,
i
suppose,
and
most
significantly,
was
injunction.
what's
the
authority
for
the
issuance
of
the
injunction,
since
as
i
read
1985(3),
it
only
says
that
the
parties
may
have
an
action
for
the
recovery
of
damages?
justice
scalia
you're
relying
on
1343?
justice
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
instance
where
there's
a
statute
that
specifically
says
in
only
an
action
for
damages
it's
parlayed
into
an
injunction?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
suppose
the
same
thing
were
done
to
prevent
unionization?
i
mean,
suppose
you
have
a
right-to-work
group
that
nationwide
seeks
to
prevent
unionization?
would...
that
would
fit
the
description
you've
just
given.
would
that
be
covered
by
this
statute?
justice
scalia
well,
then
what
you've
just
said
is
not
enough
for
a
violation
of
1985(3).
the
mere
fact
that
your--
justice
scalia
--in
organized
fashion
you
seek
to
prevent
people
from
exercising
a
constitutional
right
is...
is
not
alone
enough.
justice
scalia
yet
that
is
a
right,
the
right
to
organize.
justice
scalia
what...
let
me
go
back
to
that
statement,
that
it
must
cover
an
effort
to
take
away
a
right
that
only
the
protected
class
has.
what
do
you
do
with
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
roberts
gave
us
of
an
indian
tribe
that
has
only...
has
exclusive
fishing
rights
and
ecologists
seek
to
stop
the
fishing?
that
fits
exactly
the
description
you've
just
given
us.
this
is
the
only
class
that
has
the
rights,
and
you're
seeking
to
prevent
those
rights
from
being
exercised.
how...
are
you
saying
that,
indeed,
in
mr.
roberts'
example,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
this
statute?
justice
scalia
it
would.
justice
scalia
--the
purpose
here
was
discrimination
against
blacks,
the
purpose
in
griffin.
justice
scalia
and
that's
a
part
of
it.
justice
scalia
well
that's...
that's
a
big
issue
here.
justice
scalia
whether
it
is,
indeed,
a
class
of
women
that
is
the
object
of
the
activity,
or
whether
a
class
of
those
seeking
or
assisting
in
abortion.
justice
scalia
so
i...
you
know,
i
think
that's
a
big
difference
between
the
two
cases.
justice
scalia
that's
not
the
proper
analog.
it
seems
to
me
the
proper
analog
is
blocking
everybody
from
going
into
the
school,
and
then
saying
in
blocking
everybody
you're
also
blocking
blacks.
justice
scalia
and
you
think
that
that
would
be
a
violation--
justice
scalia
--if
you
said
we
don't
want
anybody
to
go
to
school?
justice
scalia
yes,
because
the
school
is
integrated.
justice
scalia
but
not
because
they
don't
want
people
to
go
to
school.
justice
scalia
the
assertion
here
is
that
they're
blocking
because
they
don't
want
people
to
provide
or
receive
abortions.
justice
scalia
in
the
one
case
it's
because
of
race.
in
this
case
it
remains
to
be
established
whether
it's
because
of
sex.
justice
scalia
you
want
us
to
find
that
there
was
a
purpose
of
hindrance?
justice
scalia
if
the
basis
for
our
rejection
of
your
other
claims
is
the
lack
of...
in
our
view
the
lack
of
having
established
animus,
then
the
hindrance
claim
is
over
as
well.
justice
scalia
oh,
you
have
reconsidered
your
position
on
that.
justice
scalia
last
time,
you
said
it
would
have
been
over
as
well.
justice
scalia
that's
the
effect.
there's
no
difference
between
purpose
and
effect.
i
mean,
that's
a
common
theme
throughout
your
argument.
the
footnote
you're
referring
to
said
that
the
effect
was
to
overwhelm,
but
we're
talking
here
about
purpose.
the
statute
requires
that
it
be
the
purpose,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
there's
no
finding
on
that,
is
there?
justice
scalia
well,
no,
you're
eliminating
an
animus
requirement.
justice
scalia
you
don't...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
class-based.
all
you
have
to
do
is
try
to
stop
a
policeman
from
protecting
somebody
else's
rights
isn't
that
right,
so
that
would
uniformly
be
covered.
justice
scalia
why
not?
you
bribe
him
to
do
something.
that
is,
to
deprive
someone
of
activity
that
he'd
otherwise
provide.
i
mean,
that's
the
purpose
of
bribing.
justice
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
that's
true.
justice
scalia
i'm
sure
that's
true,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
avoid
that
without
importing
into
the
hindrance
clause
the
same
class-based
animus
requirement
that
you
have
imported
into
the
other
clause.
justice
scalia
not
state
constitutional
rights?
how
can
you
eliminate
state
rights?
why
do
you
limit
the
text
just
to
federal
constitutional
rights?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case,
originally
argued
in
the
october,
1991
term
and
reargued
in
this
term,
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
an
association
and
individuals
who
organize
and
coordinate
anti-abortion
demonstrations
that
trespass
upon
and
obstruct
general
access
to
the
premises
of
abortion
clinics
in
the
washington
d.c.
area.
respondents
include
the
abortion
clinics
and
organizations
supporting
legalized
abortion.
respondents
sued
to
enjoin
petitioners
from
conducting
their
demonstrations
invoking
the
first
clause
of
section
2
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
42
u.s.c.
section
1985(3).
that
clause
prohibits
conspiracies
"for
the
purpose
of
depriving
any
person
or
class
of
persons
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws".
the
district
court
ruled
that
petitioners
had
violated
this
federal
statute
by
conspiring
to
deprive
women
seeking
abortions
of
their
right
to
interstate
travel,
and
also
rule
for
respondents
on
state
law
claims
of
trespass
and
public
nuisance.
as
relief,
the
court
enjoined
future
demonstrations
and,
based
on
the
section
1985(3)
finding,
ordered
petitioners
to
pay
respondents
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
essentially
reverse.
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
relief
under
the
first
clause
of
section
1985(3).
our
precedents
hold
that
to
establish
a
violation
of
that
section
a
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
conspirators
acted
with
some
racial
or
otherwise
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus.
our
position
to
abortion
does
not
qualify
as
a
class-based
animus,
nor
does
our
position
to
abortion
reflect
an
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
against
women
in
general.
men
and
women
are
on
both
sides
of
petitioner's
demonstrations,
and
our
precedents
indicate
that
the
disfavoring
of
abortion
is
not
ipso
facto
invidious
discrimination
against
women
as
a
class.
respondents
also
failed
to
establish
a
second
requirement
for
a
section
1985(3)
violation,
namely,
that
petitioners
intended
to
interfere
with
rights
that
are
constitutionally
protected
against
private
and
not
merely
official
interference.
the
district
court
relied,
as
i
have
said,
on
the
right
to
travel
which
is
constitutionally
protected
against
private
interference
in
certain
circumstances.
in
our
view
it
is
clear,
however,
that
petitioners
had
no
intent
to
interfere
with
that
right.
it
was
irrelevant
to
them
whether
the
women
whose
access
they
impeded
had
traveled
interstate
or
only
intrastate
to
get
to
the
clinics
in
question.
petitioners
did
have
the
intent
of
interfering
with
the
right
to
an
abortion,
but
that
right
is
constitutionally
protected
only
against
government
interference
and
under
our
precedents,
it
cannot
be
the
basis
of
a
private
conspiracy
claim
under
section
1985(3).
we
do
not
reach
the
issue
whether
respondent
could
obtain
relief
under
the
second
clause
of
section
1985(3).
the
so-called
prevention
clause
which
prohibits
conspiracies
"for
the
purpose
of
preventing
or
hindering
any
state
from
giving
or
securing
to
all
persons
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws."
respondents
did
not
state
a
prevention
clause
claim
in
their
complaint,
neither
did
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
reach
the
issue,
and
petitioners
did
not
present
this
question
in
their
petition
for
certiorari.
we
note,
moreover,
that
the
language
in
the
first
clause
that
is
the
source
of
the
class-based
animus
requirement
is
also
found
in
the
second
clause,
the
prevention
clause.
moreover,
to
prevail
with
regard
to
this
second
clause,
respondents
would
have
to
establish
that
unlike
the
first
clause
it
applies
to
private
conspiracies
aimed
at
rights
constitutionally
protected
only
against
government
interference.
because
respondents
were
not
entitled
to
relief
under
section
1985(3),
we
vacate
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
we
also
conclude
that
prior
to
this
decision
respondents'
claims
were
not
so
frivolous
as
to
deprive
the
district
court
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
but
on
remand,
the
court
should
consider
whether
the
state
law
claims
alone
can
support
the
injunction.
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
reversed
in
part,
vacated
in
part,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.

court's
