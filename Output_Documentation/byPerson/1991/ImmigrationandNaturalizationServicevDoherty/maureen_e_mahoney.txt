ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
found
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
abused
his
discretion
in
denying
mr.
doherty's
motion
to
reopen
his
deportation
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
accordingly
remanded
the
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
mr.
doherty's
claim
that
he
should
be
granted
asylum
in
the
united
states
and
that
he
should
be
deported
to
some
country
other
than
the
united
kingdom.
we
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
on
two
independent
grounds
that
i
would
like
outline
briefly
in
order
to
clarify
what
the
issues
are
for
this
court
to
decide
today.
first,
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
attorney
general
had
discretion
to
deny
reopening
because
mr.
doherty
did
not
establish
that
he
had
good
cause
for
failing
to
raise
his
claims
for
asylum
and
withholding
of
deportation
at
his
deportation
hearing
in
september
of
1986.
the
attorney
general
determined
that
he
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
raise
those
claims
at
that
hearing
and
that
he
deliberately
abandoned
the
claims
as
part
of
a
tactical
strategy
that
ultimately
failed.
if
this
court
finds
that
the
attorney
general
properly
denied
reopening
on
this
ground,
and
that
this
was
not
an
arbitrary
or
unseasoned
abuse
of
discretion,
then
it
need
not
reach
any
of
the
other
issues
in
this
case,
because
that
ground
would
in
and
of
itself
would
be
dispositive
under
this
court's
decision
in
ins
v.
abudu.
as
a
second
and
independent
ground
of
reversal,
we
ask
this
court
to
find
that
the
attorney
general
properly
exercised
his
discretion
in
determining
that
mr.
doherty's
claims
for
withholding
of
deportation
and
asylum
were
just
simply
not
sufficiently
meritorious
to
warrant
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
reopening.
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
doherty
established
good
cause
for
failure
to
file
his
claims
or
pursue
his
claims
in
september
1986
at
his
deportation
hearing,
since
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
ins
v.
abudu
is
in
fact
controlling
on
this
ground.
on
three
prior
occasions
in
the
last
10
years,
this
court
has
looked
at
the
question
of
what
the
attorney
general
or
the
board
of
immigration
appeals'
discretion
is
to
deny
reopening
for
failure
to
show
good
cause
to
raise
the
claim
at
the
initial
deportation
hearing.
in
all
three
occasions
in
this
court's
decision
in
rios-pineda,
in
the
wang
decision,
and
most
recently
in
abudu,
this
court
found
that
the
denial
of
reopening
on
these
grounds
must
be
sustained
unless
the
decision
is
arbitrary
and
unreasoned.
we
submit
that
there
is
simply
no
way
that
the
attorney
general's
determination
on
this
issue
in
this
case
was
arbitrary
or
unreasoned.
this
court's
decision
in
abudu
illustrates
that
there
are
essentially
two
interrelated
requirements
for
establishing
good
cause
to
file
an
application
for
withholding
of
deportation
or
asylum
after
the
deportation
hearing
has
been
closed.
and
these
requirements
are,
first,
under
the
regulations,
mr.
doherty
is
required
to
reasonably
explain,
to
provide
a
legally
sufficient
explanation
of
why
he
did
not
raise
the
claims
or
pursue
the
claims
at
the
initial
deportation
hearing.
and
second,
he
must
also
show
that
his
claims
for
withholding
of
deportation
and
asylum
are
based
upon
evidence
or
circumstance
that
arose
subsequent
to
the
hearing.
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
doherty
has
ever
provided
a
reasonable
explanation
of
why
he
didn't
pursue
these
claims
in
september
of
1986.
the
attorney
general
found
that
the
reason
that
he
didn't
pursue
the
claims
in
september
of
1986
was
that
he
had
an
opportunity
to
do
so,
but
he
was...
it
was
part
of
an
effort
on
his
part
to
designate
ireland
as
the
country
of
deportation,
to
withdraw
his
claims
for
asylum
and
withholding
of
deportation,
and
to
try
to
expedite
his
deportation
so
that
he
could
reach
ireland
before
the
supplemental
extradition
treaty
took
effect.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
under
the
statute,
under
243(a),
an
alien
has
the
opportunity
to
designate
the
country
that
he
wants
to
be
deported
to.
but
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may
reject
that
designation
if,
in
his
view,
it
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
the
standard
practice
before
the
immigration
judges
that's
been
in
effect
for
many
years,
in
fact
probably
50
years,
is
that
when
a
national
of
a
country
designates
a
country
other
than
his
country
of
nationality,
the
immigration
judge
gives
him
an
opportunity
to
submit
a
claim
for
withholding
of
deportation
or
asylum
to
the
country
of
nationality.
the
whole
idea
here
is
that
it
is
critical
to
the
process
that
all
of
the
defenses
to
deportation
be
asserted
at
the
time
of
the
deportation
hearing
in
order
to
avoid
piecemeal
appeals.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
it
was
a
surprise.
the
ins
took
the
position
at
the
hearing
in
september
of
'86
that
it
was
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
mr.
doherty
should
not
be
deported
to
ireland,
that
it
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
united
states'
interests,
that
this
was
an
issue
of
serious
concern
at
the
highest
levels,
and
when
that
argument
was
rejected
by
the
immigration
judge,
the
ins
indicated
that
it
would
appeal
that
decision
because
it
was
sufficiently
concerned
that
deportation
to
ireland
would
be
prejudicial.
so
there
really
can
be
no
question
that
mr.
doherty
understood
in
september
of
1986
that
he
was
at
risk.
and
similarly,
your
honor,
there
was
no
reason
why
he
couldn't
plead
in
the
alternative.
in
this
court's
decision
in
abudu,
dr.
abudu
was
in
precisely
the
same
kind
of
circumstance.
he
designated
england
as
the
country
that
he
wanted
to
be
deported
to,
but
he
was
a
national
of
ghana.
so
the
immigration
judge
in
that
case,
just
like
the
immigration
judge
in
this
case,
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
withholding
of
deportation
to
ghana
and
for
asylum,
an
opportunity
that
dr.
abudu
did
not
avail
himself
of.
and
thereafter
when
he
sought
to
reopen
the
proceedings
in
order
to
do
that,
this
court
found
that
he
was
barred,
because
you
are
permitted
to
plead
in
the
alternative.
there's
simply
no
reason...
the
issue
in
september
of
1986
that
was
presented--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
he
did
have
the
reason
that's
advanced
here.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
in
abudu?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
in
that
it
was
an
official
in
the
foreign
government
who
had
come
to
his
house--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--they
said
they
needed
a
doctor.
and
this
court--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
this
court
found
that
it
may
well
have
been
new
in
material
evidence,
but
that
he
actually
had
a
sufficient
basis
to
assert
his
claim
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
and
therefore,
it
couldn't
constitute
a
reasonable
explanation
for
having
failed
to
raise
the
claim
at
the
time
of
the
initial
hearing.
similarly
in
this
case,
mr.
doherty
has
never
contended
that
he
did
not
have
adequate
grounds
to
claim
that
he
fear
persecution
in
the
united
kingdom.
essentially--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
board
decision
in
abudu
did
say
that,
your
honor.
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
this
court
in
abudu
didn't--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--this
court
in
abudu
didn't
clarify
the
precise
bounds
of
the
discretion
that
the
board
would
have
or
that
the
attorney
general
would
have,
but
this
court
did
assume
in
abudu
that
the
new
evidence
was
material,
but
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it's
less
significant.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
essentially
what
happened
here,
the
change
was
that
mr.
doherty
lost
on
appeal.
the
issue
in
september--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
he
had
to
make
his
election...
you're
referring
to
the
change
in
irish
law?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it's
difficult
for
mr.
doherty
to
claim
that
irish
law
changed
in
a
way
that
was
in
fact
prejudicial
to
him
since
he
in
fact
represented
to
the
board
in
december
of
1986
that
decisions
of
the
irish
supreme
court
had,
quote,
"vitiated
the
political
offense
exception,
thereby
removing
any
obstacle.
"
end
quote,
to
his
extradition
from
ireland
to
the
united
kingdom.
so
i
think
that
the
issue
of
the
change
in
irish
law
is
really
one
that
is
difficult
to
understand
how
he
could
be
making.
moreover--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--saying
that
the
law
of
extradition
in
ireland
at
that
time
is
not
fundamentally
different
to
what
it
is
now.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
that
isn't
what
we
would
say.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
because
both
before
the
change
in
irish
law
and
after
the
adoption
of
the
european
convention
on
terrorism,
there
was
the
possibility
that
the
irish
government
would
not
extradite
him.
in
fact,
the
attorney
general
noted
in
his
opinion
that
there
was
recently
a
member
of
the
pira
who
was
not
extradited
to
the
u.k.
under
the
new
extradition
act--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
because
even
the
new
law
has
exceptions
in
it
that
allows
the
alien,
or
excuse
me,
the
person
subject
to
extradition
in
ireland
to
try
to
establish
that
he's
being...
the
reason
for
the
extradition
is
for
persecution
reasons.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
but
the
court
of
appeals
really--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
rested
more
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rejection
of
the
designation
by
the
attorney
general
provided
a
reasonable
explanation
for
mr.
doherty's
failure
to
pursue
his
claims
for
withholding
of
deportation
and
asylum
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
1986.
maybe
the
best
way
to
try
to
put
this
in
perspective
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--why
would
he
no
longer
wish
to
go
to
ireland?
is
that
the
question?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
that
question
is
not
answered
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
the
courts
in
this
case,
but
i
would
note
that
he
filed
his
motion
to
reopen
the
proceedings
based
upon
the
change
in
irish
law
less
than
1
month
after
the
attorney
general
meese
sent
him
a
letter
stating
that
he
had
accepted
the
ins
appeal
from
the
board's
rejection
of
the
designation
letter.
and
therefore,
he
may
well
have
surmised
that
it
was
likely
that
the
attorney
general
would
overturn
the
board's
decision
allowing
him
to
go
to
ireland.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
he
did,
your
honor,
but
the
motion
to
reopen
based
upon
the
change
in
irish
law
was
filed
less
than
a
month
after
the
attorney
general,
attorney
general
meese
notified
mr.
doherty
that
he
had
accepted
the
appeal
of
the
ins
from
the
board's
decision.
therefore,
one
inference
that
we
could
make
is
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--one
intermediate
step,
your
honor.
i
think
initially
he
wanted
to
stay
in
the
united
states.
in
the
summer
of
1986
when
the
united
states
senate
adopted
the
supplemental
extradition
treaty,
he
very
much
wanted
to
leave
the
united
states
as
quickly
as
possible
because
he
was
concerned
that
he
would
be
extradited
under
that
treaty.
so
then
he
designated
ireland.
then
when
it...
and
that
designation
was
accepted,
but
then
when
the
plan
failed
and
he
was
not
deported
to
ireland
as
quickly
as
he
wanted
to
be,
and
it
became
at
least
possible
that
the
attorney
general
was
going
to
reject
that
designation,
i
think
he
then
changed
strategy
again,
and
filed
the
motion
to
reopen.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
did
not
find
that
he
would
certainly
end
up
in
england
no
matter
what.
he
simply
found
that
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'm
not
being
clear.
i'm
saying
that
there
wasn't
a
material
difference
in
the
extradition
law
of
ireland
either
before
or
after
the
adoption
of
the
new
extradition
act.
in
other
words,
that
there
was
a
chance
that
he
would
not
be
extradited
to
the
united
kingdom
under
the
old
law
and
also
under
the
new
law.
the
attorney
general
in
fact
noted
that
a
member
of
the
pira
was
not
extradited
under
the
new
law,
just
as
sometimes
they
had
not
been
under
the
old
law.
i
think
the
key
thing
here
is
that
irish
law
really
isn't
germane
to
the
question
that
was
before
the
immigration
judge
in
september
of
1986.
the
issue
in
that
proceeding
was
should
mr.
doherty
be
deported
to
the
united
kingdom.
and
mr.
doherty
had
several
defenses
to
that
available
to
him,
and
consistent
with
standard
pleading
and
ins
practice,
he
was
required
to
assert
all
of
them
in
the
alternative.
he
could
claim
withholding
of
deportation,
he
could
claim
a
right
to
designate
ireland,
he
could
claim
asylum.
and
that
was
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
abudu,
and
it
is
the
standard
procedure
that
has
always
been
followed.
this
court
recognized
in
1963
in
united
states
v.
foti,
that
congress
very
much
wanted
to
encourage
the
consolidation
of
all
defenses
to
deportation
in
one
hearing
on
the
merits.
so
we
are
back
to
the
question,
why
didn't
mr.
doherty
simply
plead
in
the
alternative?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
it
wasn't
just
that
he
failed
to
plead.
he
failed
to
plead
for
a
tactical
reason,
a
deliberate
reason.
he
was
trying
to
expedite
his
deportation.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
additional
reasons.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the...
if
we
look
to
issue
of
the
merits,
we
can
look
first
at
the
issue
of
asylum.
now
this
court
has
indicated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
it
is
appropriate
in
considering
motions
to
reopen
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
alien
has
a
sufficient
claim
on
the
merits
that
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
reopening
is
warranted.
with
respect
to
the
asylum
claim,
the
attorney
general
determined
that
reopening
would
in
effect
be
futile
because
he...
there
were
three
grounds
on
which
he
could
exercise
his
discretion
to
deny
asylum.
and
the
first
of
those
was
that
the
nature
and
number
of
criminal
acts
that
mr.
doherty
had
committed
were
such
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
this
humanitarian
relief
under
the
asylum
laws.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
here
that
the
language
of
section
208
specifically
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may,
in
his
discretion,
grant
asylum.
there
are
no
conditions
in
the
statute,
whatsoever,
limiting
the
exercise
of
discretion.
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless,
found
that
the
discretion
was
substantially
circumscribed,
and
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
allowed
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
this
case
to
deny
reopening
without
granting
an
evidentiary
hearing.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
he
did
not
find
that
he
was
ineligible
for
asylum.
he
simply
found...
he
assumed
that
he
would
be
eligible,
that
he
would
meet
the
definition
of
refugee.
he
didn't
make
a
factual
finding,
but
was
willing
to
assume
it
for
the
purposes
of
resolving
the
issue.
but
he
did
find
that
it
would
be...
that
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
that
he
would
deny
asylum
for
reasons
relating
to
mr.
doherty's
prior
criminal
activity,
which
was
established
by
his
own
admissions
in
the
transcript
of
the
extradition
hearing,
which
was
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
and
second,
he
also
found
that
it
was
appropriate
to
deny
asylum
in
his
discretion
because
of
his
political
determination
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
foreign
policy
interests
of
the
united
states
to
give
sanctuary
to
mr.
doherty.
the
united
kingdom
and
the
united
states
had
been
engaged
in
a
collaborative
effort
to
try
to
stem
the
tide
of
terrorism
throughout
the
world,
and
believed
that
it
would
simply
be
incompatible
with
the
united
states'
position
in
that
effort
to
give
sanctuary
to
mr.
doherty.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
you
could
sustain
it
simply
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
cause.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
or
on
asylum,
you
could
sustain
it
on
the
basis
that
the
fact
that
mr.
doherty
was...
had
admitted
that
he
had
been
convicted
for
a
number
of
offenses
was
sufficient
to
allow
the
exercise
of
discretion
to
deny
asylum.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
waiver
really...
i
referred
to,
in
this
argument,
as
failure
to
establish
good
cause
or
reasonable
explanation
for
asserting
his
claims
for
withholding
an
asylum
at
the
time
of
the
september
1986
hearing.
it's
really
the
same
argument.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
he
did.
he
deliberately
and
tactically
abandoned
those
claims
at
his
september
hearing
in
order
to
expedite
the
proceedings.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
withholding,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
could
also
find
that
there
wasn't
a
sufficient
showing
on
the
merits
of
this
claim
either.
and
the
reason
why
we
certainly
believed
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
attorney
general
to
reach
this
conclusion
is
that
withholding
of
deportation
requires
two
showings,
two
mandatory
showings.
one
is
that
you
in
fact
are...
there
is
a
probability
that
you
would
be
persecuted
if
returned
to
the...
or
sent
to
the
country
of
deportation.
and
the
second
is
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
serious
reasons
for
believing
that
the
alien
has
committed
serious
nonpolitical
offenses.
that's
the
language
of
section
243(h)(c).
and
if
there
are
reasons
to
believe...
serious
reasons
to
believe
that
he
committed
serious
nonpolitical
offenses,
he
simply
is
not
entitled
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
in
this
case
he
can.
and
the
reason
he
can
is
first
of
all,
this
comes
on
a
case
for
reopening.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--statutorily
ineligible
because
of
the
undisputed
facts
from...
established
in
the
extradition
transcript
showed
that
he
simply
would
not
be
able
to
satisfy
showing--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
although
the
judge
in
that
case,
your
honor,
acknowledged...
said
right
out
that
the
facts
were
not
really
in
dispute.
the
issue
was
simply
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law
under
the
political
offense
exception
for
the
extradition
treaty,
he
had...
whether
or
not
those
facts
established
that
it
was
a
political
offense.
and
that
issue,
we
submit,
is
different
that
the
legal
characterization
that
the
attorney
general
was
required
to
make
under
section
243(h),
where
he
determined
that
acts
which
are
directed
at
the
civilian
population,
even
if
done
for
political
purposes
or
as
part
of
an
uprising
in
ireland,
in
northern
ireland,
are
nevertheless
serious
nonpolitical
offenses.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
that
limit
would
be
the
limits
of
irrationality,
wholly
arbitrary--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
attorney
general
would
find
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
deny
asylum
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
the
case
of
jean
v.
nelson,
the
attorney
general
did
take
the
position
under
a
different
section
of
the
immigration
law
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
exercise
discretion
based
upon
race.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
when
the
attorney
general
exercise
his
discretion
under
the
asylum
provision
for
reasons
such
as
foreign
policy
or
other
political
reasons,
that
the
decision
is
essentially
unreviewable,
much
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
found
that
attorney
general
meese's
decision
that
it
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states
to
send
mr.
doherty
to
ireland
would--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
could
properly
find
that
mr.
doherty's
interests
in
sanctuary
in
the
united
states
were
not
paramount,
even
if
he
was
potentially
going
to
be
subjected
to
persecution
in
the
united
kingdom.
and
that
the
national
interest
in
foreign
policy
and
leadership
in
combatting
terrorism
did
in
fact
require
the...
or
at
least
that
he
found
it
appropriate
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
that
regard.
i
would
note
that
in
this
court's
decision
in
abudu,
this
court
was
willing
to
assume
that
dr.
abudu
had
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
persecution
in
ghana,
but
nevertheless
found
that
because
he
hadn't
raised
the
claim,
that
it
was
sufficient
to
go
ahead
and
send
him
back
to
ghana
despite
that
prima
facie
showing.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
do
think
there
is
a
difference,
yes.
i
think
that
the
burden
that
the
alien
has
on
reopening...
of
showing
a
meritorious
claim
is
higher
than
it
would
be
if
this
were
at
the
initial
deportation
hearing.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
excuse
me?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
believe
that
in
wang
this
court--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--in
wang
this
court
indicated
that
it
was
important
to
give
the
attorney
general
discretion
to
come
up
with--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
abudu
was
the
only
withholding
of
deportation.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
on
a
motion
to
reopen,
we
submit
it
should
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
because
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
whether
or
not...
of
fact
and
law.
and
we
also
believe
that
this
court
should
give
deference
to
the
attorney
general's...
characterization
of
conduct
as
a
nonpolitical
offense.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
a
few
points.
first,
with
respect
to
withholding,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
there
simply
is
no
question
of
fact
to
be
resolved
at
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
doherty's
counsel
had
an
opportunity
before
the
attorney
general
to
put
in
whatever
evidence
they
thought
might
be
appropriate
to
show
that
there
was
an
issue
of
fact,
but
there
simply
isn't
one.
the
admissions
that
mr.
doherty
makes
in
his
extradition
transcript
establish
that
there
simply
are
serious
reasons
for
the
attorney
general
to
believe
that
serious
nonpolitical
offenses
were
committed.
therefore,
a
hearing
would
serve
no
purpose,
and
that
should
not
require
the
attorney
general
to
reopen
the
proceeding.
in
addition,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
attorney
general
did
rely
on
a
broader
range
of
conduct
in
determining
that
serious
nonpolitical
offenses
had
been
committed
than
those
relied
upon
by
judge
sprizzo.
judge
sprizzo
focused
very
particularly
on
the
basically
the
murder
of
the
british
captain,
and
simply
mentioned
in
passing
that
no
civilians
were
injured
on
may
2nd
of
1980,
whereas
the
attorney
general
focused
specifically
on
the
fact
that
mr.
doherty
sought
to
pursue
his
own
political
motives
not
only
through
the
killing
of
the
british
captain,
but
also
through
deliberate
acts
of
violence
directed
at
citizens
of
northern
ireland
on
that
day.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
that
was
in
the
extradition
hearing
itself.
the
facts
surrounding
the
may
'80
events
that
mr.
doherty
admitted
were
that
his
group
hijacked
a
van,
held
the
driver
captive,
forcibly
seized
a
private
residence
in
a
residential
neighborhood,
held
the
family
captive,
and
waged
a
gun
battle
with
automatic
weapons
from
the
family's
living
room.
the
attorney
general
found
that
that
conduct
was
precisely
the
type
of
conduct
that
endangered
innocent
civilians
and
could
not...
and
had
to
be
regarded
as
serious
nonpolitical
offenses.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
