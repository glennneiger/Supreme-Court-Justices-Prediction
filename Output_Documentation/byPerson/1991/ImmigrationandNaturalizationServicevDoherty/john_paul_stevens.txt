justice
stevens
of
course
in
that
case
he
didn't
have
the
reason
that's
advanced
here.
justice
stevens
no,
his
reason
was
some
dentist
had
called
on
him
or
something
like
that,
and
that
was
the
only
new
development.
justice
stevens
in
abudu,
yeah.
justice
stevens
oh,
and
said
they
needed
a
doctor
in
ghana.
justice
stevens
and
we
said
that
wasn't
enough
to
justify
it.
justice
stevens
but
even
if
he
had
adequate
grounds
in
the
first
place,
if
there
was
a
new
development
that
was
sufficiently
significant,
abudu
wouldn't
have
said
he
couldn't
have
raised
a
new
ground.
justice
stevens
but
we
didn't
say
that.
justice
stevens
because
i
remember
the
case.
justice
stevens
but
not
sufficiently
important.
that's
the
last
part
of
the
opinion,
as
i
remember.
a
separate
question
was
whether
the
new
evidence
had
sufficient
significance
to
justify
withholding,
even
though
he'd
had
sufficient
basis
originally.
justice
stevens
so
in
this
case,
though,
there's
a
difference
in
what
the
new
development
is.
and
is
arguably
more
significant
than
the
visit
from
the
man
saying
they
needed
another
doctor
in
ghana.
justice
stevens
well,
and
the
law
changed
and
he's
going
to
go
to
england
in
any
event
now,
which
he
wouldn't
have...
which
would
not
have
been
the
fact
at
the
time
that
you
say
he
had
to
make
his
election.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
if
he'd,
even
at
the
time
of
the
election,
if
he'd
been
deported
to
ireland
at
that
time,
he
still
would
have
gone
right
to
england
in
any
event?
is
that
what
you're
basically
saying?
justice
stevens
well,
does
that
mean
that
the
net
result
of
it
is
that
if
he'd
gone
to
ireland
he
still
would
have
gone
right
away
to
england?
justice
stevens
well,
then
that's
different,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you...
it's
very
difficult
to
sort
out
all
these
things.
but
cutting
through
everything,
is
it
not
more
probable
now
that
if
he
goes
to
ireland
he
will
immediately
go
to
england
than
it
was
at
the
time
he
made
his
election?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
so.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
i
don't
have
the
dates
as
well
in
mind
as
i
should,
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
attorney
general
objected
vigorously
to
his
being
deported
to
ireland
because
he
thought
it
was
a
matter
of
important
american
national
policy
that
he
go
to
england,
which
assumed...
made
me
think
the
attorney
general
thought
there
was
some
difference.
and
as
i
understand
your
argument
now,
everybody
should
have
known
he'd
end
up
in
ireland...
in
england
right
a
way,
no
matter
which
place
he
went.
justice
stevens
but
that's
my
point.
but
you're
saying
he
would
have.
that's
what
i
think
you're
telling
me
today.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask...
again,
i
should
be
better
advised
as
to
facts
than
i
am,
but
is
one
of
the
grounds
by
the
attorney
general
exercised
his
discretion
was
because
the
attorney
general's
believe
that
he
was
ineligible
for
asylum?
justice
stevens
and
is
it
your
position
that
the
attorney
general
can
make
that
determination
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing
at
all?
justice
stevens
yes,
as
i
understand
your
position,
he
could
have
denied
it
outright,
even
without
any
hearing
at
all
because
even
though...
you're
not
now
relying
on
the
breadth
of
discretion.
you're
relying
on
the
argument
he
comes
within
subparagraph
(c)
because
he's
statutorily
ineligible
for
withholding.
justice
stevens
even
though
the
hearing
officer
in
that
transcript,
the
judge,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
nonpolitical
language
did
not
apply.
it's
not
the
same
language,
of
course,
but
it's
the
same
concept.
justice
stevens
and
i
had
this
one
question,
too.
going
back
to
withholding
for
a
minute,
in
so
far
as
you
rely
on
subsection
(c)
in
the
nonpolitical
nature
of
the
crime,
do
you...
what
is
the
standard
of
review
on
that?
do
you
think
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
is
that
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
these
facts
show
that
kind
of--
justice
stevens
--so
it's
deference,
abuse
of
discretion,
and
a
mixed
question
of
law.
justice
stevens
ms.
pike,
can
i
just
ask
this
question?
in
so
far
as
the
attorney
general
relies
on
subsection
(c),
that
they're
a
serious
nonpolitical
crime,
is
the
attorney
general
assuming
that
the
facts
stated
and
developed
in
the
extradition
proceeding
are
all
correctly...
are
all
correct
as
in
that
proceeding,
or
is
he
relying
on
some
other
record?
justice
stevens
and
you
take
the
position
those
facts
are
sufficient
to
establish
the
nonpolitical
character
of
the
crime.
justice
stevens
but
why
isn't
that
record
sufficient
to
let
a
reviewing
court
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
that
subsection
(c)
is
applicable
or
not?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
it
was
the
factual
basis
for
that
conclusion,
the
record
in
the
other
case?
