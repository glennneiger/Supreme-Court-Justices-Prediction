justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
customary
that
people
faced
with
deportation
could
indicate
the
country
they'd
like
to
go
to,
and
if
the
country
were
willing
to
accept
them
that
normally
that's
where
the
person
would
be
sent?
was
that
the
standard
practice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
at
all
a
surprise
that
the
attorney
general
designated
the
united
kingdom
instead
of
ireland
as
had
been
designated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
on
grounds
of
waiver.
i
thought
you
had
argued
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
quite
the
same?
did
he
not
make
an
initial
affirmative
waiver
of
any
desire
to
have
asylum
or
deportation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
take
that
position
even
if
the
attorney
general
determined
that
the
refugee
would
be
subject
to
persecution
on
his
return
and
that
that
would
be
wrong,
but
nevertheless
that
persecution
furthered
u.s.
interests.
do
you
think
that's
within
the
scope
of
his
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
are
dealing
though
here,
ms.
pike,
i
think
with
a
motion
to
reopen.
and
there
is
discretion
there,
is
there
not,
on
the
motion
to
reopen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
pike,
if,
however,
the
attorney
general
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
in
relying
on
the
waiver
and
denying
the
motion
to
reopen,
i
just
don't
see
how
you
get
to
those
other
reasons
at
all.
you
may
have
something
valid
to
argue
about
there,
to
the
extent
that
we
get
into
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
we
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
these
were
alternative
grounds
asserted
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
certainly
your
client
waived
the
right
to
deportation.
he
waived
it.
so
the
question
is
whether
that
can
be
excused
on
this
record
and
the
attorney
general
says
no,
that
the
decision
was
calculated,
was
an
attempt,
perhaps,
to
manipulate
the
system,
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
the
attorney
general's
order
for
deportation
to
the
united
kingdom
was
itself
a
material
change
in
circumstances,
or
that
the
order
made
enactment
of
the
extradition
act
somehow
material?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
you
saying
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which?
which
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what?
was
it
the
attorney
general's
order
itself
or
that
the
order
made
the
extradition
act
amendment
somehow
material?
