chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
case
no.
90-925,
the
immigration
and
nationalization
service
v.
joseph
patrick
doherty.
you
may
proceed,
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
rehnquist
justice
blackmun
i
think
had
a
question.
let
me
be
positive
that
i
understood
you.
did
you
say
that
even
though
there's
a
convincing
showing
of
persecution,
the
attorney
general
nevertheless
may
deny
asylum
in
the
interests
of
foreign...
u.s.
foreign
policy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
ms.
pike,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
may
i
interrupt?
what
was
doherty
convicted
of
in
that
in
absentia
trial?
what
offense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
agree,
ms.
pike,
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
is
pretty
much
a
creature
of
the
attorney
general,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
in
more
ways
than
one,
you
may
feel
at
times.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
isn't
bound
by
its
rulings,
is
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
he
were
to
disregard
a
finding
of
a
subordinate
body?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
on
a
motion
to
reopen
you're
entitled
somehow
under
the
statute
to
an
opportunity
to
respond
in
that
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
one
is
no.
90-925,
ins
versus
doherty.
joseph
doherty
entered
the
united
states
surreptitiously
in
1982
after
escaping
from
a
prison
in
northern
ireland
where
he
was
convicted
of
murdering
a
british
officer.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
located
doherty
in
this
country
and
began
deportation
proceedings
against
him.
on
appeal
by
the
ins
for
an
order
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that
doherty
be
deported
to
ireland,
the
attorney
general
denies
doherty's
designation
of
ireland
as
the
country
of
deportation,
denied
doherty's
motion
to
reopen
his
deportation
proceedings,
and
ordered
that
he
be
deported
to
the
united
kingdom.
the
attorney
general
relied
on
independent
grounds
for
denying
reopening.
among
them,
that
doherty
had
failed
to
present
new
evidence
in
support
of
his
motion
and
that
doherty
had
waived
his
claims
by
withdrawing
them
at
the
first
deportation
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
order
of
the
attorney
general
denying
doherty's
designation
of
ireland
but
held
that
the
attorney
general
had
abused
his
discretion
in
denying
the
motion
to
reopen.
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
the
attorney
general
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
in
denying
doherty's
motion
to
reopen.
i,
along
with
justices
white,
blackmun,
and
o'connor,
conclude
that
the
attorney
general
acted
within
his
discretion
to
decide
that
neither
the
change
in
irish
extradition
law
nor
the
denial
of
doherty's
designation
of
ireland
qualified
as
new
material
to
support
the
reopening.
the
attorney
general
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
by
concluding
that
doherty
should
have
known
his
designation
might
be
rejected.
i
conclude
joined
by
justice
kennedy
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
in
finding
that
doherty
had
withdrawn
his
claim
to
secure
a
tactical
advantage
and
that
this
did
not
constitute
a
reasonable
explanation
for
failing
to
pursue
the
claims
at
the
first
hearing.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
justices
stevens
and
souter
have
joined.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
