ms.
mary
boresz
pike
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
a
fundamental
question
about
the
circumstances
under
which
the
attorney
general
can
deny
the
relief
of
withholding
of
deportation,
a
form
of
protection
that
is
mandatory
under
the
refugee
act,
to
an
individual
who
has
been
found
to
have
established
prima
facie
entitlement
to
it.
for
now
almost
a
decade,
the
executive
branch
of
the
united
states
government
has
labored
to
hand
over
to
the
british
government
the
individual
that
we
have
represented,
joseph
doherty.
its
efforts
have
been
consistently
rebuffed,
both
judicially
and
administratively.
the
litigation
has
been
fueled
by
executive
branch
displeasure
with
a
1984
decision
by
a
united
states
district
court
judge
denying
the
request
of
the
british
government
for
mr.
doherty's
extradition.
that
decision
categorically
denied
the
request.
the
district
court
judge,
in
rejecting
the
request,
stated
that
the
acts
for
which
mr.
doherty
was
sought
were
not
common
crimes,
nor
were
they
capable
of
being
categorized
as
acts
of
terrorism,
but
rather
they
were
political
offenses
and
verbatim
in
their
most
classic
form.
the
issues
that
are
now
before
this
court--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--there
were
two
sets
of
acts,
justice
scalia.
one
set
were
acts
of
which
mr.
doherty
had
been
convicted
in
absentia.
the
other
set
were
acts
with
which
he
was
charged.
the
first
set
of
which
he
had
been
convicted
involved
the
shooting
death
of
a
member
of
the
secret
air
service,
a
member
of
the
british
army,
in
an
encounter
between
the
ira
and
the
british
army
in
north
belfast.
mr.
doherty
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
ira
that
was
engaged
in
that
operation.
and
the
district
judge
found
that
it
had
been
an
ambush
set
up
to
engage
and
attack
a
british
military
convoy.
the
second
set
of
offenses
had
to
do--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--in
that
trial,
your
honor,
he
was
convicted
of
murder,
attempted
murder,
possession
of
weapons,
and
for
being
a
member
of
a
proscribed
organization.
the
second
set
of
offenses,
to
return
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
had
to
do
with
mr.
doherty's
escape
under
orders
of
the
ira
with
seven
other
members
of
the
ira
from
a
british
prison
in
belfast.
the
district
court
judge
determined
that
both
sets
of
offenses
were
political
and
his
extradition
could
not
be
had
for
any
of
the
offenses
for
which
his
extradition
was
sought.
the
issues,
however,
before
this
court
now
are
the
outgrowth
of
executive
branch
displeasure
with
that
decision,
and
its
long
campaign
to
escape
the
force
and
effect
of
the
decision
denying
mr.
doherty's
extradition
to
the
united
kingdom.
these
issues,
therefore,
cannot
properly
be
understood
apart
from
the
tortuous
history
of
this
case,
now
almost
a
decade
long.
for
with
each
decision
adverse
to
it,
the
executive
branch
has
resorted
to
legal
positions
more
singular
and
more
extreme.
thus
it
is
that
the
attorney
general
now
claims
the
power
to
withhold
from
an
individual
the
relief
of
withholding
of
deportation,
even
though
that
individual
has
established
prima
facie
entitlement
to
it,
and
even
though
that
form
of
protection
is
mandatory
under
the
refugee
act.
and
the
attorney
general
is
utterly
without
discretion.
once
the
standard
is
met--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--your
honor,
motions
to
reopen,
of
course,
are
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
decisionmaker.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
order
to
be
interpreted
consistently
with
the
convention
and
protocol
that
literally
gave
birth
to
the
concept
in
american
domestic
law
of
withholding
of
deportation,
that
discretion
is
not
in
this
case
absolute
or
without
limits.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this
very,
very
significant
holding
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
conjunction
with
a
motion
to
reopen.
and
that
is,
your
honor,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
established
that
mr.
doherty
had
met
the
initial
threshold.
he
had
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
entitlement
to
that
relief.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
the
board
of
immigration's
order
clearly
directs
that
the
case
be
reopened
to
allow
him
to
apply
for
both.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
yes,
that
is,
your
honor.
i
mean,
they
in
effect,
though,
do
not
dispute
that
he
met
the
threshold
he
had
to
show,
and
that
he
established
prima
facie
entitlement.
now
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
ignore
the
fact
that
he
did
establish
that
he
fit
within
this
narrow
category.
it
is
a
very
high
standard.
and
in
effect,
to
deny
him
that
relief
without
even
granting
him
a
hearing.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
your
honor,
i--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--i
could
not,
chief
justice,
stand
before
you
and
with
a
straight
face
deny
the
proposition
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
is
not
a
creature
of
the
attorney
general.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
the
attorney
general
is
not
bound
by
the
rulings
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
but
against
the
history
of
this
case,
chief
justice,
he
cannot
simply
disregard
them.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
because,
your
honor,
the
concept
of
abuse
of
discretion
means
just
that,
discretion
can
be
abused.
and
here
it
was.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
because
when
he
disregarded
it,
your
honor,
given
the
state
of
the
record
in
the
case,
he
did
it
in
a
manner
that
was
fundamentally
unfair.
despite
the
fact
that
we
had
met
the
threshold
that
we
had
to
meet,
the
threshold
that
entitled
us
to
a
hearing,
he
went
ahead
and
made
a
determination
as
to
the
ultimate
merit
of
our
claim
without
ever
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
in
any
way
respond
to
the
negative
features
that
he
found
in
mr.
doherty's
background.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
your
honor,
absolutely,
i
do,
when
the
relief
that
is
at
stake
is
withholding
of
deportation.
i
do
not
think
that
in
fairness
i
could
state
that
as
certainly
if
there
was
another
form
of
protection
that
was
here
implicated.
but
we
must
focus
on
the
fact
that
it
is
withholding
of
deportation,
that
we
did
meet
that
threshold,
and
that
that
form
of
protection
is
mandatory.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
we
are
in
a
position
where
having
been
deprived
any
opportunity
to
put
forward
our
side
of
the
case,
that
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
attorney
general.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
your
honor,
i
have
to
disagree
on
that,
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
once
we
do
meet
the
threshold,
it
really
does
become
at
the
very
least
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
leap
ahead
and
make
the
ultimate
determination
as
to
relief
that
is
mandatory
without
affording
us
a
hearing
on
this
record.
because
the
very
things
that
the
attorney
general
asserted
as
the
basis
on
which
he
premised
his
denial
were
the
very
acts
that
were
found
by
another
factfinder
in
the
basis
of
an
adversarial
context
where
we
did
have
an
opportunity
to
put
forward
evidence
and
contest
them.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
that's
right.
but
of
course,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
it
is
accepted
that
the
political
offense
exception
is
really
the
mirror
image
of
the
nonpolitical
crimes
aspect
of
asylum
law.
both
exist
to
provide
protection
that
is
viewed
under
the
law
as
being
legitimate
to
people
who
commit
political
offenses,
or
who
in
the
asylum
context
may
even
commit
crimes,
but
still
under
withholding
of
deportation,
be
entitled
to
protection.
so
we
think
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
justice
kennedy,
that's
what
makes
this
wrong.
this
is
a
case
that
comes
before
this
court
with
a
history
of
now
almost
9
years.
and
that
history
cannot
be
ignored
because
time
and
time
again
the
integrity
of
mr.
doherty's
positions
have
in
fact
been
sustained.
now,
it
may
have
been
a
different
case,
were
there
not
this
background.
but
it
is
there.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
there
are
several
reasons,
your
honor.
to
start
with,
first
of
all,
there
may
well
be
new
facts
here.
in
the
context,
not
only
mind
you,
of
withholding
of
deportation,
but
also
of
asylum,
under
the
regulations,
even
when
there
is
a
mandatory
ground
for
denial
put
forward
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
an
immigration
judge,
the
regulations
see
that
as
serious
enough
to
require
that
the
alien
be
afforded
a
hearing
at
which
he
can
prove
that
the
mandatory
ground
for
denial
does
not
apply.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
we
think
in
this
case
were
are,
your
honor,
because
the
facts
are
extraordinary,
and
the
case
is
extraordinary.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
once
reopening
is
granted,
yes,
it
would
be
reopened
for
the
purposes
the
board
had
deemed.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
we
think,
your
honor,
based
on
past
history
in
the
case,
we
would
certainly
be
able
to
establish
that
mr.
doherty
had
not
engaged
in
any
serious
nonpolitical
crimes,
and
that
he
had
not
engaged
in
any
acts
of
persecution.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
i
don't
see
that
it
does,
justice
kennedy,
because
of
the
close
fit
between
those
various
concepts.
i
think
that
at
the
very
least,
that
extradition
record
has
to
rest
very
firmly
against
the
attorney
general's
diametrically
opposed
conclusion.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
we
never
had
the
opportunity.
that's
exactly
what
we're
saying.
we
never
had
that
opportunity.
and
that
is
what
would
have
been
dealt
with
in
the
context
of
the
reopened
hearing.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
your
honor,
what
we
established
for
the
motion
to
reopen
was
that
which
we
were
required
to
establish.
our
prima
facie
eligibility
or
entitlement,
more
correctly,
in
the
area
of
withholding
of
deportation,
to
the
relief
that
we
sought.
and
in
addition,
we
established
the
changed
circumstances
and
the
new
facts
that
once
excepted
provided
us
the
avenue
for
going
forward
with
the
rest
of
our
case.
yet,
because
of
the
determination
that
the
attorney
general
made,
that
hearing
process
was
in
effect
pretermitted.
we
never
got
to
that.
and
i
think
that
again,
in
the
context
of
withholding
of
deportation,
that's
a
very
serious
matter
because,
as
for
example,
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
ins
v.
abudu
had
indicated,
that
you
cannot
leap
ahead
in
the
context
of
relief
that
is
nondiscretionary,
that
an
ultimate
determination
on
the
merits
can
be
rendered
in
the
case
of
asylum,
for
example,
or
suspension
of
deportation
or
adjustment
of
status.
but
not,
not
in
the
case
of
withholding
of
deportation.
because
it
is
mandatory,
it
is
so
significant.
and
yet
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
well,
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is...
the
first
part
of
your
question
is
yes,
he
does
assume
that
those
facts
are
correctly
established
in
the
record.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
we
take
that
position,
but
our
alternative
position,
if
you
will,
is
that
at
the
very
least,
they
entitle
us
to
a
hearing.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
we
think,
your
honor,
that
under
the
circumstances
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
decision
cannot
be
made
because
absent
the
additional
facts
that
could
be
adduced
at
the
hearing,
the
proper
balancing
that
is
required
in
terms
of
the
determination
of
the
entitlement
to
that
relief
and
possible
exclusion
from
the
protection
of
that
relief
can't
be
made.
and
it
is
clear
from
the
handbook
that
construes
the
convention
and
the
protocol
that
the
withholding
of
deportation
section
is
fashioned
on,
that
that
process
is
absolutely
central
to
the
whole
determination
of
claims
for
withholding
of
deportation.
so
absent
our
part
of
the
equation,
we
are
in
effect
having
a
decision
being
made
against
us
that
does
not
involve
our
part
of
the
case.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
if
i
might
continue,
though,
to
respond
to
what
really
was
the
second
part
of
your
question
as
well.
there
is
a
very
curious
aspect
of
the
attorney
general's
decision
here
which
your
question
alluded
to.
and
that
is
that
although
the
attorney
general
accepts
that
the
facts
that
he
chose
to
rely
on
from
the
extradition
proceeding
were
correct,
he
admits
in
his
opinion
that
in
effect,
he
does
not
have
to
find
that
joseph
doherty
himself
committed
serious
nonpolitical
crimes,
that
it's
adequate
if
he
can
find
that
the
irish
republican
army
committed
serious
nonpolitical
crimes.
in
effect,
it
is
a
tacit
admission
that
there
is
not
in
this
record
any
evidence
that
joseph
doherty
committed
serious
nonpolitical
crimes.
and
the
thing
that
is
most
compelling
about
this,
and
indeed
most
chilling,
is
that
the
attorney
general
ultimately
bases
his
decision
on
what
he
refers
to
as
material
that
is
exhaustively
documented...
that's
his
phrase,
exhaustively
documented,
in
the
record
of
another
case,
another
immigration
case
altogether
to
which
we
were
not
a
party,
and
which
did
not
involve
issues
that
were
even
remotely
identical
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
consequently,
we
think
to
have
relied
on
that
and
to
have
made
the
determination,
number
one,
without
letting
us
have
a
hearing,
and
then
on
the
basis
of
facts
that
are
in
another
record
altogether,
really
did
deprive
us
of
any
opportunity
to
establish
entitlement.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
justice
o'connor--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--they
are,
but
again,
i
must
return
to
the
basic
point.
this
is
mandatory
relief
and
we
stepped
into
the
circle
that
entitles
us
to
go
further.
if
it
were
not
mandatory
relief,
there
might
be
a
different
result.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
i
would
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
that.
this
notion
that
mr.
doherty
had
manipulated
the
system
in
a
cynical
or
self-serving
way
i
think
is
absolutely
incorrect,
and
i
do
not
think
the
record
can
be
construed
in
that
way.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
that
mr.
doherty
was
doing
was
making
an
effort
to
avoid
being
deported
to
a
country
where
he
had
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution.
that
i
do
not
think
constitutes
manipulation
of
the
process.
and
in
an
effort
to
do
that,
justice
o'connor,
he
availed
himself
of
an
option
that
is
available
under
the
statute
to
designate
a
country
of
deportation,
in
effect
to
accomplish
his
own
removal
from
this
country
at
the
expense
of
at
that
time
going
forward
on
an
asylum
claim
because
he
knew
that
he
would
not
be
rejected
by
ireland.
and
it
is
that
fact
that
is
central
here,
and
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
other
cases,
because
under
other
cases...
if
i
might
just
step
back
one
moment.
first
of
all,
you
had
queried
earlier
was
this
standard
procedure.
absolutely
not.
the
bia
said
in
its
own
decision
it
had
found
no
other
case
where
this
had
ever
happened.
and
given
that
fact,
mr.
doherty's
expectation
of
deportation
to
ireland
was
under
the
circumstances
reasonable.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
we
did
not
say
that
at
the
time,
your
honor,
because
our
motion
to
reopen
had
been
filed
in
advance.
and
mr.
meese's
decision
came
down
afterward.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
absolutely.
no
question
about
it.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
let
me
think.
absolutely,
it
was
a
change
in
circumstance.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
both
are
material
for
separate
reasons,
but
ultimately
they
dovetail.
mr.
meese's
order
was
material
because
what
it
did
was
to
transform
the
possibility
that
mr.
doherty
would
not
be...
let
me
start
again.
the
significance
of
the
meese
decision
was
that
it
in
effect
ensured
that
mr.
doherty
was
going
to
be
returned
directly
to
a
country
where
he
feared
persecution.
that
was
the
significance
of
it.
we
had
filed
the
motion
to
reopen
within
48
hours
of
the
implementation
of
the
extradition
act
of
1987
because
under
that
act,
justice
o'connor,
what
we
feared
was
indirect
return,
but
certain
return
to
a
country
of
persecution.
so
both
of
those
were
absolutely
material
under
the
reopening
standards
that
the
regulations
set
forth.
and
we
do
not
think
in
any
way
that
the
meese
decision
vitiates
what
had
been
the
original
integrity
of
the
claim
under
the
extradition
act.
ms.

boresz

not
as
to
the
need
for
a
hearing
on
the
motion
to
reopen
for
withholding
of
deportation
and
asylum.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
that
is
correct.
but--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--we
do
not,
your
honor.
but
he
made
that
order,
and
the
second
circuit
appreciated
that
order
as
being
made
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
reopen
that
also
involved
claims
for
relief
from
deportation.
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
even
though
that
order
directed
his
deportation
to
the
united
kingdom,
that
order
is
not
subject
to
being
acted
on
until
mr.
doherty's
claims
for
relief
under
the
refugee
act
are
properly
adjudicated.
and
if
i
might,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
try
to
finish
the
notion
of
why
the
waiver
did
not
here
obtain,
under
the
normal
situation,
which
everybody
agrees
did
not
happen
here,
if
indeed
there
had
been
any
perceived
risk
of
deportation
to
the
united
kingdom,
the
country
where
mr.
doherty
feared
persecution,
the
immigration
judge
would
have
been
obligated
to
go
forward,
to
afford
him
the
opportunity
then
and
there
to
proceed
on
his
asylum
claim.
the
record
reveals
that
that
never
happened.
and
it
never
happened
because
unlike
other
cases,
in
this
case,
it
was
already
known
at
that
point
in
time,
there
was
no
uncertainty,
the
irish
government
had
indicated
it
would
accept
him
into
the
national
territory.
that
was
where
he
was
going.
that
was
the
country
he
had
designated.
and
therefore,
the
immigration
judge
saw
no
purpose
to
go
forward
on
a
claim
for
asylum
to
prevent
deportation
to
a
country
where
he
wasn't
going
to
be
deported.
it
was
that
simple.
and
the
asylum
claim,
the
asylum
hearing
did
not
go
forward
at
that
point
in
time
for
that
reason.
i
would
like
finally
to
respond
in
this
point
to
one
other
point
that
had
been
made
by
our
adversary
relative
to
the
extradition
act
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
material
change
in
the
law
as
to
that.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
was
indeed
a
very
material
change
that
was
worked
by
the
extradition
act,
and
that
has
to
be
appreciated
in
the
context
of
providing
the
adequate
basis
for
mr.
doherty's
motion
to
reopen.
the
extradition
act,
1987,
as
a
matter
of
black-letter
law,
wrote
out
of
existence
the
political
offense
exception
to
extradition.
whatever
the
irish
courts
may
have
done
prior
to
that
really
does
not
in
any
way
obtain
in
terms
of
the
finality
that
was
accomplished
once
the
extradition
act
was
implemented.
once
it
was,
there
was
no
question.
that
defense
was
not
available.
that
was
the
defense
that
mr.
doherty
had
successfully
defended
against
extradition
with
here,
and
we
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
have
successfully
defended
against
extradition
there.
certainly
he
had
a
strong
case.
but
with
the
passage
of
the
extradition
act--
ms.
mary
boresz
pike
--your
honor,
we
had
acknowledged
that
the
irish
courts
had
made
decisions
that
had
made
savage
inroads
into
the
political
offense
exception.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
we
did.
but
the
defense
still
existed.
it
was
capable
of
being
raised.
and
we
felt
that
given
the
facts
of
mr.
doherty's
case,
that
certainly
he
would
still
be
able
to
go
forward
with
that,
and
conceivably
at
least
have
the
opportunity
of
defending
against
extradition
on
that
ground.
once
the
extradition
act
was
passed,
that
was
absolutely
removed.
there
simply
was
no
possibility
of
doing
that.
i
see
that
i
am
out
of
time.
thank
you.
