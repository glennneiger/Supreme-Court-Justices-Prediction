if
you
lose
on
that,
i
take
it
you
still
have
to
address
the
withholding.
justice
kennedy
if
i
could,
counsel.
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
stevens,
you
were
talking
about
the
attorney
general's
authority,
under
your
position,
of
withholding
deportation
as
an
initial
matter
because
there's
no
substance
to
the
case.
i
take
it
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here
because
this
was
just
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
reopen,
and
that
would
be
a
much
simpler
position
for
you
to
defend,
i
take
it.
justice
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
justice
kennedy
what's
your
principal
authority
for
that?
justice
kennedy
in
wang.
justice
kennedy
was
that
a
withholding
of
deportation
case?
justice
kennedy
that's
under
(h)(1)
that
he
determined
the
alien's
life
or
freedom
would
be
threatened?
justice
kennedy
but
i
take
the
attorney
general
says
that
he
has
an
insubstantial
case
to
resist
the
attorney
general's
determination
that
the
exceptions
apply,
the
(a)
and
the
(c)
exception.
is
that
the...
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
kennedy
did
the
attorney
general
justify
his
decision
not
to
reopen
under
the
withholding
section
just
on
the
ground
that
the
threshold
hadn't
been
met?
or
that
even
if
it
had,
he
would
make
the
determination
under
(a)
and
(c)
that
the
relief
was
not
available?
i
don't
know
why
you're
so
emphasizing
the
threshold,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
attorney
general
prevails
if
he
has
discretion
to
find
that
you
have
an
insubstantial
case
under
(a)
or
(c).
justice
kennedy
that
was
in
the
extradition?
justice
kennedy
but
your
whole
point
is
that
you're
relying
on
the
extradition
record.
it
seems
to
me
that
almost
cuts
against
you.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
question
of
law.
did
you
allege
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
what
new
evidence
you
would
have
to
adduce
to
show
nonapplicability
of
the
(a)
and
(c)
exceptions
for
subsection
(h)?
justice
kennedy
well,
don't
you
have
that
opportunity
in
connection
with
your
submission
for
the
motion
to
reopen,
to
just
make
an
offer
of
proof?
