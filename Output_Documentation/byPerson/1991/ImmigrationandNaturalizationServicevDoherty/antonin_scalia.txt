justice
scalia
before
you
do
that,
if
it
is
as
you
say,
why
would
he
have
had
this
change
of
heart?
is
there
a
change
in
the
attitudes
of
the
irish
government
recently
or
in
the
makeup
of
the
irish
government?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
you
think
he
was
rolling
the
dice,
that
what
he'd
like
most
of
all
was
to
stay
in
this
country,
not
be
deported
at
all.
and
he
went
whole
hog
for
that
initially.
then
when
it
seemed
he
wasn't
going
to
get
that,
he'd
say
i
better
have
a...
i'd
better
have
a
fall-back
position,
and
that's
when
he
said
send
me
to
ireland,
even
though
it
was
no
more
attractive
later
than
it
was
originally.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
those...
what
did
those
acts
consist
of
that
he
so
found?
justice
scalia
that
might
be
true,
ms.
pike,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
goes
to
whether
it
was
arbitrary
for
him
to
deny
reopening.
now
i
think
what
you've
established
is
a
district
judge
had
come
to
a
different
conclusion
about
whether
(a)
or
(c)
applied.
but
the
basis
for
which
he
came
to
that
conclusion
was
surely
a
basis
of
law,
not
a
basis
of
fact.
the
facts
were
out.
and
additional
hearing
wouldn't
have
established
any...
you're
not
asserting
they
would
establish
any
new
facts.
the
question
is
whether
that
offense
met
the
meaning
of
(a)
or
(c).
now
what
you've
established
is
that
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
differs
from
a
united
states
district
judge's.
that
may
well
be
good
cause
for
a
lawsuit,
but
i
don't
see
why
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
attorney
general
to
say,
look,
it's
no
use
reopening,
we're
just
wasting
time
to
reopen
because
i
know,
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
know
that
i'm
going
to
find
this
comes
within
(a)
or
(c).
now
if
you
think
it
absolutely
doesn't,
maybe
you
have
some
appellate
recourse.
but
why
should
he
waste
his
time
reopening
when
he
knows
that
he's
going
to
find
that
(a)
or
(c)
applies?
i
find
it
hard
to
call
that
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
scalia
as
an
original
matter,
but
surely
not
when
those
facts
aren't
brought
forward
during
the
course
of
a
long
proceeding,
and
the
issue
is
whether
to
reopen
the
proceeding,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
you're
not
entitled
to
a
full
factual
inquiry
before
he
decides
whether
to
reopen
or
not.
justice
scalia
you
argued...
i
thought
you
had
argued
that
he
couldn't.
i
thought
you
had
argued
that.
