justice
white
well,
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
you.
justice
white
on
this
issue
either.
justice
white
i
thought
that...
didn't
attorney
general
meese
order
him
to
be
sent
to
england?
justice
white
do
you
have
a
better
reason
than
just
failure
to
plead
for
sustaining
the
attorney
general's
discretion?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
but
i
just
wondered
if
there
was
another
reason.
justice
white
well,
your
time
is
certainly
running.
justice
white
and
it's
your
submission
that
this
ground
was
an
independent
ground?
justice
white
and
that
if
we
said...
sustained
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
what
you
said
before
this,
we
don't
need
to
get
to
the
foreign
policy
issue?
justice
white
on
either
one
of
them.
justice
white
well
that
just
means
that
the
proceeding,
the
matter
is
reopened
if
you're
going
to
just
have
the
whole
thing
out
on
the
table.
in
effect,
it's
just
reopening
it.
justice
white
what
would
happen
if
it
were
reopened
that
would
be
different
if
you
had
the
hearing
you
wanted?
justice
white
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
attorney
general
meese's
order?
justice
white
i
know,
but
did
it
say
that
he
properly
ordered...
he
properly
refused
deportation
to
ireland?
justice
white
and
properly
ordered
doherty
deported
to
england?
justice
white
you
don't
challenge
that
here?
justice
white
ms.
pike.
you
have
2
minutes,
if
you
have
rebuttal.
