against
the
united
states.
mr.
moyer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
bring
that
point
here,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
petition
for
certiorari
simply
says
the
question
you
are
raising
is
were,
was
your
client
entrapped
as
a
matter
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
numbers
were
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
he
testify
as
to
the
number
of
times
he
was
solicited
and
this
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
did
testify
in
some
other
aspects
of
the
case,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
moyer.
mr.
larkin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
our
previous
cases
haven't
parsed
this
matter
quite
so
finely,
have
they,
made
kind
of
a
minuet
out
of
it.
they
have
simply,
in
sherman
they
identified
all
the
facts
which
led
the
court
to
conclude
there
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
it
didn't
go
into
a
lot
of
discussion
of
what
had
to
come
first.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
moyer,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
most
of
mr.
justice
roberts'
opinion
was
not
approved
by
the
majority
in
sorrells.
and
again
in
sherman
the
court
was
asked
to
adopt
his
concurring
opinion
in
sorrells
and
it
refused
to
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moyer.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
90-1124,
jacobson
against
the
united
states.
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice

filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
i,
justice
kennedy
joined,
and
in
which
justice
scalia
joined
except
as
to
part
two.
