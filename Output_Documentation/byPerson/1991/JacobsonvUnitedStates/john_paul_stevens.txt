justice
john
paul
stevens
i
happened
to
look
through
them
and
most
of
them
are
boys
standing
up
all
by
themselves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
different
from
what
your
description
was,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
it
was
not
unlawful
to
purchase
them
at
the
time
they
were
purchased?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
since
you
say
that's
the
short
answer
to
the
whole
case
and
since
you
concede
that
at
that
time
nothing
illegal
had
transpired,
take
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
of
someone
who
regularly
used
marijuana
in
a
foreign
country
where
it
was
lawful,
and
you
had
nothing
except
that
evidence
to
support
the
predisposition
count
if
you
found
the
person
eventually
in
possession
of
marijuana
that
a
government
agent
had
somehow
or
other
delivered
to
him.
would
that
prior
evidence
be
sufficient
to
establish
predisposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
sufficient
to
establish
it,
too,
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
he
just
purchased
one
item
5
years
earlier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
we
don't
have
an
attempt
to
distribute.
mere
possession
is
not...
you
have
to
have
a
parallel
example,
you
have
to
have
an
offense
consisting
of
mere
possession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
of
course
he
hadn't
seen
the
second
set
of
magazines
at
the
time
he
ordered
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
ones...
the
crime
he
committed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
had
seen
the
1984
magazine,
but
that,
he's
not
being
put
in
jail
or
punished
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
being
punished
for
a
magazine
that
he
ordered
without
seeing
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that,
but
i
understand
your
opponent
to
be
arguing
that
predisposition
must
rest
on
some
evidence
that
he
was
willing
to
violate
the
law
and
had
previously,
before
the
government
engaged
in
the
attempt
to
induce
him
to
engage
in
this
transaction,
had
previously
done
something
that
he
thought
was
illegal.
do
you
have
any
cases
that
are
like
this
in
the
sense
that
the
prior,
that
the
activity
prior
to
the
contact
by
the
government
did
not
involve
any
knowledge
of
illegality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you're
relying
on
evidence,
and
maybe
that's
enough,
of
his
knowledge
after
the
government
began
its
program.
prior
to
the
government's
first
contact
with
him
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
had
ever
done
anything
knowing
it
to
be
unlawful,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do...
well,
i
understand,
but
do
you
have
any
cases
saying
it's
not
required?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this,
whichever
way
we
go
we're
going
to
have
to
make
a
little
new
law
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
evidence
that
this
man
did
any
of
those
things,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
probably
by
the
time,
by
2...
after
2
years
of
investigation
the
government
was
reasonably
convinced
there
was
no
danger
of
any
of
that,
wasn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
never,
he
never
mailed
any
pictures
back,
he
never
described
that
kind
of
activity,
he
denied
having
engaged
in
that
kind
of,
the
pedophilia
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a...
just
out
of
curiosity,
i
didn't
know
about...
is
that
an
illegal
mailing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
had
been
face-to-face
and
instead
of
what
is
written
on
paper
in
the
correspondence
it
had
been
said
orally?
would
it
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
and
a
half
years
isn't
reluctance.
two
and
a
half
years
of
failing
to
make
a
purchase
of
this
kind
is
not
reluctance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
well,
then
the
case
does
present
the
question...
i
hadn't
quite
realized...
does
present
the
question
of
whether
legal
conduct,
you
know,
with
the
same...
whether
the
legal
conduct
before
any
contact
is
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
isn't
necessarily
found.
they
necessarily
have
to
have
relied
on
the
two
1984--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
yet,
mr.
larkin,
let
me
just
follow
up
on
something
you
said.
first
of
all,
if
the
evidence
that
he
engaged
in
a
lawful
but
shabby
transaction
back
in
1984
is
not
sufficient
because
you
have
to
prove
intent
to
violate
the
law,
then
you
would
have
to
also
support
it
by
stuff
like
the
language
that
you
called
our
attention
to
on
page
9
which
was
shortly
before
the
actual
purchase,
which
does,
i
have
to
agree,
is
very
strong
evidence
of
a
willingness
to
violate
the
law
at
that
time.
but
you
say
that
must
also
prove
a
willingness
to
violate
the
law
before
the
government
began
its
program
back
in
1985,
i
guess
it
was.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
we
have
all
finally
distilled
the
requirement
that
there
must
have
been
evidence
of
a
predisposition
to
violate
the
law
before
the
government's
first
contact
in
1985,
which
could
be
established
in
one
of
two
ways;
by
the
original
purchase
of
a
unlawful
piece
of
material,
and
later
by
responding
to
solicitations
which
were
rather,
plainly
indicated
something
illegal.
but
those
were
way,
two
and
a
half
years
later.
and
so
you
have
to
say
in
effect
from
what
he
did
in
1987
you
an
reasonably
infer
that
back
in
1984
he
was
also
then
willing
to
violate
the
law.
that's
really
what
you're
saying
is
that
that's
a
reasonable
inference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
does
any
of
the
other
evidence
between
the
original
contact
by
the
government
and
the
final
purchase
in
1987
contain
the
same
type
of
graphic
indication
that
it
was
probably
illegal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's,
of
course,
the
actual
material
there
is
not
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
was
that?
