mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
february
of
1985
the
government
made
my
client,
keith
jacobson,
the
target
of
an
undercover
sting
operation
known
as
the
american
hedonist
society.
the
government
had
no
reason
when
it
did
that
to
believe
that
mr.
jacobson
had
committed
a
crime,
was
planning
to
commit
a
crime,
or
was
engaged
in
a
course
of
criminal
conduct.
between
february
1985
and
june
1987
the
government
targeted
mr.
jacobson
in
five
different
and
separate
undercover
operations,
the
object
of
each
of
which
was
to
determine
if
he
was
receiving
or
trading
sexually
explicit
photos
depicting
children
through
the
mails.
after
the
third
operation
concluded
on
october
16,
1986
when
mr.
jacobson
broke
off
correspondence
with
one
calvin
comfort,
the
government's
chief
witness
and
a
postal
inspector
masquerading
as
a
carl
long,
the
government
had
even
less
reason
to
believe
that
jacobson
was
likely
to
commit
a
crime
than
it
did
when
it
started
with
the
american
hedonist
society
more
than
a
year
earlier.
just
the
same,
jacobson
was
included
in
operation
looking
glass.
that
was
sting
number
5
in
march
of
1987,
and
was
finally,
after
28
months
of
government
effort,
induced
to
receive
a
single
magazine
depicting
a
child
engaged
in
sexually
explicit
conduct.
i
contend
that
mr.
jacobson
was
entrapped
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
contend
that
where
the
defendant's
predisposition
to
commit
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment,
to
engage
in
criminal
conduct,
does
not
appear
before
government
agents
target
him.
the
government
has
failed
to
prove
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
also
contend
that
where
the
defendant
has
been
offered
numerous
opportunities
to
break
the
law
and
he
has
not
done
so,
the
government
should
leave
him
alone.
entrapment
cases
decided
that,
by
this
court
have--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--entrapment
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
they
did
find--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--that
the
defendant
was
not
entrapped.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
jury
verdict
of
guilty,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
there
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
i
say
that
the
jury
verdict
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
fatally
flawed
because
the
government
was
permitted
to
offer
to
the
jury
evidence
that
mr.
jacobson
suffered
from
a
weakness,
that
he
had
a
sexual
desire
to
look
at
pictures,
sexually
explicit
pictures
of
boys,
and
that
he
was
a
homosexual.
this
is
not
the
subject
of
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--the
government
developed
this
evidence,
your
honor,
through
sexual
survey,
attitude
surveys
and
undercover
correspondence
with
mr.
jacobson
after
the
government
initially
included
him
in
the
american
hedonist
society.
the
cases
have
always
held
that
the
predisposition
of
the
defendant
must
appear
before
he
begins
to
interact
with
the
government
agents,
before
they
contact
him,
before
anything
at
all
is
done.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
there
was
an
objection
to
the
jury
charge,
your
honor,
and
there
were
instructions
offered.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that's
right.
there
was
an
objection
to
the
jury
charge
on
entrapment
and
there
were
instructions
offered
which
would
define
predisposition
and
also
which
would
define
inducement,
and
the
trial
court
did
not
give
those
instructions.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
the
cases
indicate,
your
honor--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--and
that
is
my
position.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is,
and
i
intend
to
argue
that
as
i
proceed
with
my--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--the
question
was,
upon
which
you
granted
certiorari,
justice
o'connor,
was
whether
or
not
he
was
entrapped
as
a
matter
of
law.
and--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--well,
the
question
was,
was
he
entrapped
as
a
matter
of
law
where
he
does
not
meet
the
attorney
general's
guidelines
for
inclusion
in
an
undercover
operation
and
where
he
does
not
meet
the
guidelines
established
by
the
postal
service
for
inclusion
in
the
operation.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
not
in
my
view,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
that
situation
can
be
readily
distinguished
from
the
situation
where
the
government
goes
out,
finds
a
suspect
on
a
list
somewhere,
out
of
the
telephone
book
actually
if
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
is
to
be
followed,
and
the
situation
in
which
the
government
so
structures
the
undercover
operation
that
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
persons
who
are
drawn
to
the
operation
are
predisposed
to
commit
the
crime.
for
instance--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--the
petitioner
does
not
concede--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--that's
the
government's
contention,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
child
nudist
magazines
is
the
way
they
were
described.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice,
i
would
not,
for
this
reason--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--if
i
may
answer
your
question
by
an
analogy,
suppose
the
government
in
the
interest
of
the
health
of
all
of
us
in
the
united
states,
particularly
those
like
me
who
have
asthma,
banned
smoking
completely.
now
then,
would
the
government
then
be
permitted
under
an
undercover
operation
to
find
the
list
of
philip
morris
customers
and
offer
philip
morris
cigarettes
to
these
customers
in
a
plain
brown
wrapper?
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
was
a
malum
prohibitum
crime
here,
receive
child
pornography,
or
at
least
that's
the
way
the
district
court
regarded
it.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
what
you're
doing
there
is
offering
me
an
example
that
involves
a
pernicious
substance,
and
indeed
i
don't
disagree
that
child
pornography
is
subject
to
government
control.
that
isn't
my
point.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
child
pornography
can
be
pernicious,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
my
point
is
that
you
cannot
assume
that
somebody
is
going
to
engage
in
criminal
activity,
knowing
that
it's
criminal,
just
because
he
has
engaged
in
that
activity
when
it
was
legal.
and
the--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--if
your
honor
please,
the
substance
was
not
illegal
for
him
to
obtain,
or
that
is
to
say
the
books
were
not
illegal
for
him
to
obtain.
now
you're
asking
me
to
assume
that
these
books
meet
the
test
of
the
statute
and
they
show
a
child
engaged
in
a
sexually
explicit
conduct.
nevertheless
and
irrespective
of
whether
they
do
or
not--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--yeah,
for
the
purposes
of
the
hypothetical.
nevertheless,
it
was
not
and
it
had
never
been
a
crime
to
receive
this
type
of
material
through
the
mail,
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
stanley
it
was
not
a
crime
to
possess
it
and
the
state
of
nebraska,
it
had
not
adopted
a
statute
making
it
illegal
to
possess
child
pornography
until
well
after
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
in
omaha.
so
therefore
the
government
has
to
assume
from
the
fact
that
mr.
jacobson
did
something
that
the
government
has
to
concede,
indeed
stipulate,
did
not
violate
the
law,
that
he
will
violate
the
law
later.
and
then
after
they
made
that
assumption
and
they
targeted
him
for
these
undercover
operations
they
offered
him
opportunities
to
purchase
child
pornography,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
or
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
he
ever
did
that.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that
he...
i...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
guidelines
that
were
adopted
by
the
attorney
general
quite
go
that
far.
i
think
subparagraph
(a)
of
those
guidelines
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
indication
based
on
information
developed
through
informants
or
other
means
that
the
subject
is
engaging,
has
engaged,
or
is
likely
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
of
a
similar
type.
and
i
think
that
is
the
rule
that
judge
heaney
was
trying
to
arrive
at
when
he
required
a
reasonable
suspicion
based
upon
an
articuable
fact
in
his
panel
opirion.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that
makes
the
difference,
that
the
government
is
assuming
that
he
will
break
the
law.
and
then,
your
honors,
the
government--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
the
early
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
all
say
that
before
anything
at
all
is
done
with
respect
to
the
government,
with
respect
to
the
defendant.
furthermore
the
devitt
and
blackmar
instruction,
the
standard
instruction
on
entrapment,
has
stated
that
same
language,
and
that
instruction
has
been
given
and
given
and
given
and
approved
repeatedly
by
numerous
of
the
circuits.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
may
i
answer
that,
your
honor,
by
referring
to
footnote
3
on
page
26
of
the
brief?
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
which
we
point
out,
there
is
a
strip
cite
there,
of
numerous
cases
in
which
the
devitt
and
blackmar
instruction--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--those
are
not
from
this
court,
your
honor.
these
cases
are
from
the
circuit
courts.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
he
knows
it's
against
the
law.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
even
though
he
knows
it's
illegal.
that's
correct.
now
i
think
this
court
said
in
the
matthews
case
that
in
an
entrapment
situation
where
the
defendant
treated...
pleaded
entrapment,
that
the
defendant
could...
would...
could
consistently
take
the
witness
stand
and
say
that
i
did
not
intend
to
commit
a
crime
and
that
i
was
induced
to
commit
the
crime
by
the
government,
and
he
would
not
necessarily
be
lying
when
he
said
that.
and
in
fact
mr.
jacobson
in
this
case
did
just
that.
he
took
the
witness
stand
and
he
said
the
government
induced
me
to
buy
this,
and
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
committing
a
crime
when
i
did
it.
i
think
that
the
evidence
also
reflects,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--the
statute
requires
that
he
know
that
it
is
child
pornography.
there
was
an--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--the
statute,
your
honor,
does
not
require
that
he
know
that
the
receipt
is
a
crime.
it
only
requires
that
he
know
he
is
receiving
child
pornography.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
and
we
argued
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
that
he
had
to
receive,
knowingly
receive
child
pornography,
knowing
that
it
was
a
crime,
and
the
trial
court
rejected
that
instruction,
so
the
jury
never
determined
that
issue.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
and
that
is
what...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
district
court
ruled.
we
took
issue
with
that.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
with
that
ruling,
and
that
was
a
point
that
we
briefed
and
argued
rather
strenuously
in
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
the
contention
that
we
made.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that
was
one
of
the
issues,
i
think,
that
we
put
in
our
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--that
was--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
i
petitioned
it
here,
but
cert
was
not
granted
on
it,
i
believe.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
because
you
run
the
danger
of
manufacturing
crime
and
ensnaring
people
who
would
otherwise
not
do
what
the
statute
prohibits
them
from
doing
except
by
the
government
inducement
and
the
government
persuasion.
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
fact
that
he
has
an
appetite
doesn't
have
some
significance,
but
what
i
think
that
the
defense
of
entrapment
has
always
intended,
and
what
was
said
in
sorrells,
is
that
the
government
must
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
engaged
or
willing
to
commit
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment.
the
fact
that
somebody
uses
marijuana
in
denmark
where
it's
legal,
or
the
netherlands
where
it's
legal,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
when
they
come
to
the
united
states
they
will
use
it.
but
when
the
government
targets
them
five
times
and
works
on
them
for
28
months
they
may
well
induce
that
to
happen,
even
though--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
mean
to
leave
the
impression
that
it
is
irrelevant.
that
is
of
some
significance.
but
i
am
saying
that
entrapment
has
always
focused
on
the
willingness
of
the
individual
to
commit
the
crime,
to
engage
in
a
course
of
criminal
conduct,
and
has
not...
i
think
the
case
that
puts
it
best,
your
honor,
is
the
sherman
case
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
government
may
not
play
on
the
weakness
of
an
innocent
party
in
order
to
induce
them
to
commit
a
crime.
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
they
are
doing
here.
they
are
identifying,
through
sexual
surveys,
which
they
send
to
the
defendant
after
they
begin
their
undercover
operation,
whether
or
not
he
has
a
sexual
preference
for,
i
think
the
phrase
was
preteen
sex.
and
he
got
a
2
on
that,
1
being
the
most
interested
and
2
being
interested.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
i
think
five.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
the
fifth
one
is
i
don't
know,
and
i
think
the
fourth
one
is
i
am
not
interested,
and
the
third
one
is
i
am
somewhat
interested.
so
they
had
those
two
responses.
and
then
they
had
a
letter
from
him
in
which
he
said
that
his
sexual
preference
was
young
guys,
18
plus,
doing
their
thing
together.
and
what
they
focused
on
was
the
2
that
said
that
he
was
interested
in
preteen
sex
or
teenage
sexuality
i
think
one
of
them
was
phrased,
and
they
worked
on
that.
and
they
repeatedly
offered
him
opportunities
to
buy
child
pornography.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
inducement
in
the
case
it
has
always
been
a
requirement
that
the,
in
the
lower
courts,
that
the
defendant
show
some
reluctance
to
commit
the
offense.
in
this
case
the
government
had
to
prod
the
defendant
to
respond
to
the
second
sexual
attitude
survey,
then--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
no,
sir,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case.
it's
a
little
confusing
in
the
record,
but
the
exhibits
in
this
case
that
begin
with
the
100
number
are
defendant's
exhibits
during
the
cross-examination
of
the
government's
principal
witness,
who
was
calvin
comfort.
defendant's
exhibits
102
and
103
were
produced.
now,
102,
or,
i
see,
103
was
a
blank
sexual
attitude
survey,
one
that
hadn't
been
filled
out,
and
the
government
agent
testified
that
he
had
gotten
that
blank
sexual
attitude
survey
from
the
government
agent.
and
then
exhibit
102
was
a
later
letter
that
the
government
agent
had
sent
him,
posing
as
a
gerri
ellis
of
the
heartland
institute
for
a
new
tomorrow,
in
which
she,
or
that
is
the
government
agent,
said,
you
didn't
answer
the
sexual
attitude
survey
and
won't
you
please
help
us.
we
are
an
organization
that
believes
in
sexual
freedom
and
freedom
of
choice,
and
we
need
the--
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
he
did
not
write
that.
he
never
sent
that
letter
to
the
government
agent.
that
letter
was
in
his
home
when
the
home
was
searched,
and
it
was
in
our
possession
at
the
trial
and
we
produced
it.
he
typed
that
on
the
letter,
but
then
he
never
sent
it.
he
just
sent
back
the
completed
sexual
attitude
survey
after
they
prompted
him
to
send
it
in.
and
we,
we
produced
the
letter
to
show
that
they
had
prompted
him.
another
time
that,
of
course,
that
he
evidenced
reluctance
was
when
the
american
hedonist
society
sent
him
a
list
of
supposed
persons
who
supposedly
had
the
same
sexual
interests
as
he
had,
and
he
did
not
correspond
with
any
of
them.
at
that
juncture
the
government
itself
prompted
him
by
initiating
the
correspondence
under
the
guise
of
carl
long.
i
think
even
more
significantly,
however,
was
the
american
hedonist
society
undercover
operation.
the
hedonist
society
had
a
letter
called,
the
little
light,
a
newsletter
that
he
was
supposed
to
get
quarterly,
and
the
postal
inspector
testified
that
he
put
his
name
on
the
mailing
list
and
that
he
started
to
send
him
the
newsletter.
and
then
he
was
asked
what
did
the
american
hedonist
society
offer
its
members,
and
he
responded
child
pornography.
now,
when
they
searched
mr.
jacobson's
home
they
didn't
find
any
newsletters,
and
we
didn't.
we
looked,
we
couldn't
find
any
ourselves.
and
apparently
he
had
thrown
away
all
these
newsletters
which
offered
child
pornography
in
the
form
of
advertising
which
the
postal
inspectors
had
of
course
planted
in
the
magazine,
and
he
never
responded
to
one
of
their
ads,
although
i
think
the
court
does
have
exhibit
119(a)
in
which
he
did
fill
out
an
ad
that
he
wanted
to
place
but
again
which
he
never
sent
to
the
american
hedonist
society.
so
by
the
time
they
get
down
here
to
this
last
operation,
the
operation
looking
glass
in
which
he
finally
buys
the
child
pornography,
they
have
tried
him
three
different
times
and
they
have
been
unable
to
induce
him
in
any
of
these
three
different
undercover
operations
to
buy
child
pornography.
and
if
he
got
eight
newsletters,
which
would
be
approximately
the
right
number,
between
the
time
that
he
was
enrolled
in
the
looking
glass
survey
and
the
time
that
he
was
enrolled
in
the
looking
glass
sting
and
the
time
that
he
was
enrolled
in
the
hedonist
survey,
then
he
would
have
been
solicited
in
some
way,
in
some
form,
for
child
pornography
something
like
8
to
11
times.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
i
don't
believe
he
did,
your
honor.
i
think
we
take
that
inference
from
the
testimony
of
the
government's
agents
and
their
cross-examinations.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
he
testified,
yes,
to
his,
to
some
other
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
but
there
were
at
least
eight
offers,
and
that
is
where
the
carl
long
correspondence
was
leading,
because
that's
how
the
carl
long
tactic
works.
according
to
the
agent
who
employed
it,
you
try
to
mirror
the
personality
of
the
individual
with
whom
you
are
corresponding
in
order
to
find
out
what
their
interests
are
and,
if
they
are
willing,
to
get
them
to
send
you
child
pornography
through
the
mails.
and
they
were
unable
to
get
mr.
jacobson
sufficiently
interested
in
the
correspondence
to
even
continue
to
write
to
the
government
agent.
now,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
all
this
is
plain
from
the
government's
brief
and
the
amicus
briefs.
they
are
trying
to
penetrate
the
child
pornography
underground.
they
are
trying
to
see
if
this
man
is
a
man
who
collects
child
pornography
and
habitually
sends
it
through
the
mails
to
other
persons
who
have
similar
pedophilic
interests.
and
the
fact
that
he
didn't
continue
the
carl
long
correspondence
is
pretty
conclusive
evidence
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
child
pornography
underground
and
that
he
was
not
trading
child
pornography
with
other
persons
with
pedophilic
interests.
and
at
that
point
we
contend
that
even
if
there
was
some
evidence
at
the
beginning
that
he
had
an
interest
in
this
stuff,
it
was
crystal
clear
to
the
government
that
he
had
not
been
breaking
the
law
and
was
not
breaking
the
law
and
couldn't
be
induced
to
breaking
the
law
after
the
third
sting
operation,
which
was
over
a
year
after
the
first
one,
and
at
that
point
he
should
have
been
left
alone.
and--
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
excuse
me.
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
excuse
me.
to
return
to
the
question
you
asked
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
also
to
page
13
of
our
reply
brief
in
which
we
quote
from
mr.
justice
roberts'
concurring
opinion
in
sorrells
v.
united
states
where
he
says
that
it
has
been
generally
held
where
the
defendant
has
proved
an
entrapment
it
is
permissible
to
show
in
rebuttal
that
the
officer
guilty
of
incitement
of
the
crime
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
defendant
was
a
person
disposed
to
commit
the
offense.
this
procedure
is
approved
by
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
cite
the
concurring
opinion
for
that
proposition.
i
cite
it
for
the
proposition
that
mr.
justice
roberts
there
mentions
that
the
majority
opinion
in
sorrells
recognizes
that
the
practice
had
been,
at
that
time,
at
the
time
sorrells
was
decided,
and
i
think
your
question
went
to
whether
or
not
i
had
any
authority
from
this
court,
that
the
majority
opinion
approved
the
practice
of
showing
that
the
officer
guilty
of
incitement
of
the
crime
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
the
defendant
was
a
person
committed,
or
predisposed
to
commit
the
offense.
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
wish
to
make.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
subparagraph
(a)
sting
that
the
attorney
general
describes
in
his
guidelines
and
the
column
(b)
sting,
or
subparagraph
(b)
sting.
i
think
the
ad
is
of
the
(b)
sting
variety
and
the
pawn
shop
is
of
the
(b)
sting
variety.
in
other
words,
you're
putting
up
an
opportunity
for
illegal
activity
which
has
been
structured
so
that
there
is
a
reason
for
believing
that
those
drawn
to
the
opportunity
are
predisposed
to
commit
it.
mr.
george
h.
moyer,
jr.
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor,
it's
clear
that
mr.
jacobson
was
the
target
of
a
government
undercover
operation.
he
had
not
committed
any
crime
before
they
targeted
him,
and
that
would
clearly
fall
under
subparagraph
(a)
where
the
attorney
general
has
said
that
there
is
a
reasonable
indication
based
on
information
developed
through
informants
or
other
means
that
the
subject
is
engaging,
has
engaged,
or
is
likely
to
engage
in
illegal
activities
of
a
similar
nature.
