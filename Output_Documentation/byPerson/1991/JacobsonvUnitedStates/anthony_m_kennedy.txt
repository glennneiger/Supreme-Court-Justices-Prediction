justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
the
statute
require
a
knowing
receipt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
i
take
it,
then,
the
jury
just
disbelieved
that.
i
mean,
that's
an
element
of
the
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
your
position
if
someone
uses
marijuana,
say
in
the
netherlands
where
it's
legal,
that's
irrelevant
as
to
whether
he
is
disposed
to
use
it
here?
i
find
that
very
difficult
to
accept.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
one
of
relevance,
whether
or
not...
you're
telling
us
it's
just
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
larkin,
if
the
bare
boys
i
and
ii
evidence
was
not
found
and
they
had
just
sent
out
general
mailers,
would
there
have
been
entrapment,
then,
according
to
instruction
number
15
at
page
11,
because
then
there
would
be
no
evidence
that
he
had
the
predisposition
before
the
first
contact.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
does
your
whole
case
depend
on
bare
boys
i
or
ii,
or
am
i
misreading
the
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words
the...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
in
other
words
the
contact
can
be
made
even
before
there
is
evidence
of
predisposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it...
well,
that
answers
it.
in
other
words
the
government
doesn't
have
to
know
of
that
evidence
at
the
time
that
it
makes
the
contact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
do
about
the
pawn
shop?
the
government
sets
up
a
pawn
shop
and
i
see
the
pawn
shop,
i
have
no
predisposition.
i
get
to
thinking
about
it,
gee,
there's
a
pawn
shop.
i
can
take
anything
in
there,
they
don't
know
whether
it's
mine
or
not.
and
i,
and
so
i
thereafter
conceive
the
idea
of
stealing
something
and
bringing
it
to
the
pawn
shop.
