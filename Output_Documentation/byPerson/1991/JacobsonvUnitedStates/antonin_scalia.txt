justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moyer,
refresh
my
recollection.
was
the
jury
permitted
to
find
entrapment
in
this
case
but
did
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
found--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
say
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
up
to
the
jury
that
there
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
doesn't
that
tend
to
prove
that
he
was
disposed
to
commit
the
crime?
it
doesn't
have
to
establish
it
in
its
entirety.
it's
just
one
element
of
proving
that
he
was
disposed
to
commit
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
how
did
they
get
him...
they
got
his
name,
as
i
understand
it,
because
of
his
purchase
of
material
which
would
not
have
been
illegal
at
the
time
he
originally
purchased
it,
but
which
would
have
been
illegal
after
this
act
was
passed
that
made--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
concede
that,
but
that's
the
government's
contention.
justice
antonin
scalia
these,
what
is
it,
bare
boys
i
and
bare
boys
ii
books
that
purported
to
be
just
books
about
nudist
colonies.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
suppose
we
agree
with
the
government
that
those
books
would
violate
the
law
later
passed.
would
you
then
concede
that
there
was
adequate
reason
to
pursue
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
government
would
then
know
he
had
an
appetite
for
what
was,
what
was
illegal?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
there's
a
little
difference
between
what
you
might
call
a
malum
prohibitum
and
a
malum
in
se.
i
don't
think
the
proper
analog
would
be
cigarettes,
but
perhaps
cocaine.
if
that
were
originally
not
illegal
and
then
made
illegal,
you
think
the
government
could
not
target
people
who
were
known
prior
users
of
cocaine?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
think
it's
pernicious?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
think
it's
pernicious?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not...
only
after
it's
outlawed?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
the
activity
is.
if
it's
that
kind
of
an
activity,
just
as
if
it
would
have
been
cocaine,
i
think
one
may,
one
may
suspect
this
is
a
person
who
does
not
care
that
much
about
societal
norms.
you
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
you
to
concede
that.
we're
assuming
that
for
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
are
requiring
more
than
mere
suspicion
that
he
is
the
type
of
person
who
would
violate
the
law.
you
require
that
they
know
that
he
had
violated
the
law
before.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
what
you
require,
that
they
have
to
suspect
that
he
has
violated
the
law
before?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
here
it
was
activity
of
a
similar
type,
if
we
accept
the
hypothesis,
but
it
was
not
yet
illegal,
and
you
say
that
makes
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
what,
what's
an
example
of
one
of
the
early
cases
that
you
just
referred
to
in
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
all...
none
of
these
are
from
this
court,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
if...
he
doesn't
have
to
know
it's
a
crime
in
order
to
be
convicted,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--um-hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
addition
to
knowing
that
it's
pornography
he
has
to
know
that,
that
it's
child
pornography,
he
has
to
know
that
it's
illegal
to
receive
child
pornography?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
thought
he
responded
to
all
of
these
quite
promptly,
with
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
wrote
that
he
hadn't
gotten
the
sexual
attitude
survey.
i
thought
that's
what
had
happened,
but
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
as
though
each
contact
was
a
contact
that
offered
him
child
pornography,
and
that's
not
how
i
understand
the
record.
some
of
the
contacts
just
asked
him
about
his
attitudes
and
he
responded
to
some
of
those.
it
wasn't
he
was
offered
child
pornography
11
times,
turned
them
down,
and
the
government
continued
to
nag
him
until
he
finally
bought
one.
there
wasn't
an
offer
every
one
of
those
11
times,
was
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
mislead
him
to
think
it's
legal
when
it's
illegal?
you
don't
really
think
the
government
can
do
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
go
back--
--you
just
lost
me,
mr.
larkin.
i
think
you've
gone
too
far
now.
that's--
[laughter]
go
back
to
the
related
question
of
what
it
shows
about
predisposition.
if
it's
a
willfulness
crime
and
your
only
evidence
is
that
before
he
committed
the
prior
act
he
said
is
this...
i
am
sorry,
and
your
only
evidence
is
that
he
committed
acts
which
were
not
unlawful
at
the
time
he
committed
them,
that
would
not
be
sufficient
evidence
of
a
predisposition
to
commit
a
willfulness
crime,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
highly
unlikely.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
you
were,
you
didn't
concede
that
there
has
to
be
evidence
of
predisposition
before
the
first
contact.
i
thought
you
said
you
were
willing
to
take
that
on
but
you
don't
really
think
that's
essential.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
that
that,
that
i
have
been
entrapped
now
because
i
did
not
have
the
predisposition
when
i
first--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moyer,
i've
been
thinking,
if
we
adopted
that
proposition
that
you
are
urging
on
us,
that
it's
unlawful
for
the
government
to
approach
a
person
unless
the
government
knows
in
advance
of
approaching
him
that
he
has
the
predisposition,
then
i
guess
the
government
couldn't
put
an
ad
in
a
magazine,
you
know,
that
suggested
that
it
has
child
pornography
for
sale.
right?
because
that
ad
would
get
to
all
sorts
of
people,
including
people
that
don't
have
the
predisposition,
and
any
conviction
derived
from
that
would
be
invalid.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between,
you
know,
a
throwaway
in
the
mail
and
an
ad
in
the
newspaper.
i
mean,
they're
both
standard
ways
of
advertising
the
availability
of
something.
