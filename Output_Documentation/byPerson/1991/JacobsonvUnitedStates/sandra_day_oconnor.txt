well,
mr.
moyer,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
must
always
prove
predisposition
in
these
entrapment
cases
by
establishing
events
that
occurred
before
the
government
started
its
sting
operation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
that
virtually
the
same,
then,
as
requiring
reasonable
suspicion
or
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
this
particular
individual
is
suspect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
didn't
grant
certiorari
on
that
question,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
matter
of
law.
you
think
that
incorporates
your
first
question
as
presented
on
certiorari?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
you're
correct
in
your
position
that
the
events
have
to
have
occurred
before
the
government
sting
operation,
then
i
suppose
some
of
these
sting
operation
pawn
shops
and
so
forth
that
are
set
up
in
various
communities
are
operating
illegally,
then,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact
isn't
that
a
very
common
practice
throughout
the
country
in
an
effort
to
find
burglar
rings
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
larkin,
is
this
similar
to
some
of
the
sting
operations
involving
public
officials
around
the
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
have
somebody
posing
as
someone
who
wants
a
vote
in
exchange
for
financial
benefits.
