mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
short
answer
to
every
argument
that
petitioner
has
made
here
today
and
in
his
brief
can
be
found
in
the
two
magazines,
bare
boys
i
and
bare
boys
ii,
that
were
discovered
during
the
may
1984
search
of
the
electric
moon.
those
magazines
are
demonstrably
not,
as
the
dissent
below
said
and
as
petitioner
has
again
said
here
today,
mere
nudist
magazines.
on
the
contrary,
those
magazines
consist
almost
exclusively
of
photographs
of
teenage
and
preteen
boys
naked,
posing
spread-legged
in
bed
or
in
other
poses
that
graphically
focus
on
their
genitalia.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
yet
in
the
covers
on
both
magazines
and
in
several
other
of
the
pictures
it
is
clear
that
what
you
have
is
someone
who
is
posed
in
a
picture
in
order
to
focus
on
the
genitalia.
that
is
not
a
mere
nudist
magazine.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
a
mere
nudist
magazine
would
be,
as
i
am
told
by
the
postal
service,
would
be
a
picture,
for
example,
pictures
of
a
nudist
colony
where
you
have
people,
for
example,
of
both
genders
and
all
ages
in
all
sorts
of
activities.
these
magazines
clearly
are
designed
to
focus
on
the
genitalia
of
young
boys.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
was
not
a
violation
of
federal
law,
yes.
i
do
not
know,
do
not
believe
it
was
a
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
sufficient
to
allow
the
question
to
go
to
the
jury,
yes.
for
example--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
for
example,
it
was
not
a
violation
of
federal
law
prior
to
1970
to
consume
or
possess
with
the
intent
to
distribute
or
to
distribute
lsd.
so
if
a
person
throughout
the
sixties
was
a
major
dealer
in
lsd
he
would
have
been
distributing
it
at
a
time
when
it
didn't
violate
federal
law.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
that
may
not
be
sufficient
to
show
that
he
possessed
with
the
intent
to
distribute,
which
is
what
you
have
to
make
out
before
you
get
to
the
entrapment
defense.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it's
receipt,
not
mere
possession
that
we
have
here.
and
what
we
have
here,
it's
clear
when
you
look
at
the
magazines,
is
someone
who
is
willing
to
receive
this
type
of
material
through
the
mail.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
when
you
say
the
second
set,
i'm
not
sure
which
ones
you
mean.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
oh,
yes.
but
there
is
no,
he
had
no
doubt
what
it
was,
what
it
contained.
if
you
looked
at
page
9
of
our
brief
you'll
see
we
have
quoted
from
the
government
exhibit
that
describes
what
that
magazine
contains,
and...
it's
on
the
right-hand
side
and
i'll
read
it
to
you.
the
catalog
described
the
contents
of
the
magazine
as
follows;
11-year-old
and
14-year-old
boys
get
it
on
in
every
way
possible.
and
i'll
leave
the
rest
for
the
court
to
read.
there's
no
doubt
that
when
he
ordered
gx4,
the
magazine
that
led
to
his
conviction,
he
knew
what
he
was
getting
through
the
mails,
and
he
doesn't
even
claim
here
in
court
today
that
he...
we
somehow
duped
him
into
believing
that
what
he
was
receiving
was
not
child
pornography.
as
i
understand
his
argument,
his
argument
is
we
somehow
duped
him
into
believing
that
it
was
legal
to
receive
child
pornography.
well,
the
statute
doesn't
require
us
to
prove
a
willful
element,
which
sometimes
shows
up
in
other
statutes
where
you
have
to
show
someone
not
only
committed
acts
that
were
a
violation
of
the
law,
but
knew
at
the
time
he
committed
those
acts
that
it
was
illegal
to
do
so.
this
statute
doesn't
require
that.
it
requires
a
knowing
receipt--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
what
you're...
if
what
you're
asking
is
do
i
have
any
change
in
the
law
cases
where
on
day...
on
a
certain
day
something
that
was
not
previously
illegal
became
illegal,
i
don't
have
any
case
dealing
with
that
problem.
but
if,
but
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
not
the
type
of
material
that
is,
it
can
be
described
as
innocuous,
as
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
correct.
but
that's
not
required.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
because
that
problem--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
suppose,
on
that
point.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
because
normally
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
someone
is
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
that
is
known
to
be
illegal,
and
the
question
is
just
whether
this
person
committed
the
crime
because
the
criminal
design
was
implanted
in
his
head
by
the
government
or
committed
the
crime
of
his
own
free
will.
now,
in
this
case
we
think
the
evidence
shows
without
a
doubt
that
he
was
predisposed,
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
he
was
predisposed.
as
i
said,
those
two
magazines
themselves
allow
a
reasonable
jury
to
find
that
he
was
predisposed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
am,
i
would
be
willing
to
defend
the
proposition,
and
will
do
so
now
if
you
like,
that
we
don't
need
a
reasonable
suspicion
before
targeting
a
sting.
and
i
will
defend
that
both
in
terms
of
entrapment
and
in
terms
of
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
can
be,
yes.
that
it
can
be
in
the
terms
that
judge
hand
once
used,
ready
complacence.
for
example,
if
the
government
sets
up--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that
would
be
enough.
that's
exact...
that's
not
all
that
different,
i
think,
from
the
example
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned
of
opening
up
a
pawn
shop.
it's
not
an
uncommon
practice
to
open
up
a
pawn
shop
to
see
who
is
going
to
bring
in
stolen
items,
and
there
we
don't
have
reasonable
suspicion
as
to
any
one
person.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
and
those
sorts
of
matters
don't
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
focusing--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
type
of
targeting
and
pursuing
that
the
court
had
in
sherman,
so
i'm
not
really
sure
it's
fair
to
use
it
in
that
aggressive
sense.
this
case
is
materially
different
from
sherman,
which
is
the
only
case
where
the
court
has
ever
held
someone
was
entrapped
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
would
go
to
the
jury,
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
this
case,
as
i
started
to
say,
is
materially
different
from
sherman.
in
sherman,
to
use
the
vernacular,
the
government
leaned
on
sherman
and
leaned
on
him
hard.
you
had
repeated
face-to-face
contacts.
here,
by
contrast,
all
the
contacts
are
through
the
mail.
there
was
no
more
burden
on
the
petitioner
than
is
the
burden
on
anyone
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
material
they
received
through
the
mail
they
don't
want.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
we
have
the
sort
of
mailings
that
go
on
in
public
official
cases.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
can
have
that,
and
you
can
have
a
situation
in
which
you
don't
have
everything
happen
in
the
course
of
a
short
period
of
time
like
you
would
in
the
pawn
shop
example.
in
the
pawn
shop
example
somebody
walks
in,
makes
the
sale,
and
that's
it.
it
happened
very
quickly.
in
other
types
of
undercover
operations
it
may
take
longer.
it
may
take
longer
because
the
person
involved
is
very
cagey.
and
you
can't,
i
think,
criticize
the
way
the
investigation
is
conducted
by
looking
at
it
on
an
ex
post
basis.
this
is
what
the
postal
service
knew
when
they
searched
the
electric
moon
in
may
of
1984.
they
knew
the
petitioner
had
ordered
bare
boys
i
and
ii
through
the
mail,
and
they
knew
what
was
in
bare
boys
i
and
ii.
if
you
looked
at
page
21
of
the
transcript
there's
a
stipulation
to
that
effect.
in
addition,
exhibit
1
attached
to
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
search
warrant
application
contains
a
2-page
report
summarizing
the
search
of
electric
moon
that
was
sent
out
by
the
san
diego
postal
inspectors.
the
postal
service
also
knew
that
people
who
are
interested
in
this
sort
of
material
oftentimes
will
trade
it
amongst
themselves
through
the
mail,
discreetly,
because
this
is
a
very
clandestine
opportunity.
they
will
sometimes
produce
this
material
themselves
using
children
as
the
actual
actors
and
victims,
and
they
will
sometimes
also
use
this
type
of
material
as
a
means
of
enticing,
seducing,
instructing,
and
then
molesting
and
blackmailing
children.
the
postal
service--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i'm
not
accusing
him
of
that,
but
the
point
is
this.
you
can't--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
responses
here
are
no
more
inconsistent
with
the
conclusion
that
he
could
have
been
involved
in
the
production
of
this
material
or
he
could
have
been
involved
with
child
molesting
than
that
he
wasn't.
the
postal
service
didn't
know.
and
what,
just
as
you
can't
justify
a
search
by
the
fact
that
uncovers
contraband
and
thereby
retroactively
render
the
search
lawful,
you
can't
retroactively,
i
think,
undo
the
search
that
discovers,
or
an
investigation
that
discovers
someone
has
broken
the
law
simply
because
he
hasn't
committed
an
even
more
heinous
crime
than
you
ultimately
discover.
the
postal
service
just
didn't
have
complete
knowledge,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
they
could
do
when
they
had
the
two
magazines
in
their
possession
and
knew
what
they
contained
was
engage
in
these
sort
of
low-key
step-by-step
contacts
to
find
out
if,
for
example,
maybe
there
was
some
horrible
mistake
made
and
petitioner's
name
shouldn't
have
been
on
the
mailing
list.
so
they
engaged
in
this
sort
of
conduct
over
time.
the
record
doesn't
contain
eight
offers
to
sell
child
pornography.
the
record
contains
the
two,
produit
outaouais
by
the
custom
service
and
the
magazine
that
was
sent
out
from
the
postal
service
saying
a
part
of
project
looking
glass
by
the
far
eastern
corporation.
they
engaged
in
this
conduct
in
part,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
infer,
to
see
if
petitioner
would
send
them
material
through
the
mail,
not
simply
to
see
if
he
would
purchase
it.
i
mean,
after
all,
petitioner
did
send
one
thing
through
the
mail.
if
you
look
at
his
response
to
the
second
carl
long
letter
you
will
see
he
sent
the
magazine,
part
of
the
new
york
native,
through
the
mail
to
carl
long.
so
they
had
a
variety--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
do
not
believe
that
you
could
charge
the
defendant,
excuse
me,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
with
sending
that
magazine
because
it
didn't
contain
the
types
of
pictures
that
you
would
have.
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
would
certainly
warrant
your
interest
given
that...
the
magazine
itself
and
the
stories
that
are
in
it.
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
what
you
have
here
is
not
by
any
means
a
sort
of
overbearing
type
of
investigation
that
you
had
in
sherman.
i
mean,
the
far
eastern
trading
company
that
mailed
out
the
brochure
and
that
mailed
out
the
letter
beforehand
describing
the
brochure
wasn't
trying
to
elicit
sympathy.
it
was
trying
to
sell
a
product.
calchini,
the
informant
in
the
sherman
case,
was
trying
to
elicit
sympathy,
and
of
a
type
that
most
people
could
succumb
to.
it
was
a
sympathy
towards
a
person
who
was
attempting
to
go,
a
cleansing
process
to
get
rid
of
his
drug
addiction
but
couldn't
do
it
and
was
in
the
agonies
of
withdrawal.
and
sherman
wound
up
breaking
the
law,
and
the
court
said
he
was
entrapped
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
isn't
remotely
the
type
of
case
we
have
here.
as
i
said,
these
contacts
are
through
the
mail,
they're
not
face-to-face.
there
was
no
indication
that
he--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
because
you
also
don't
have
the
reluctance
that
you
did
in
the
sherman
case.
he
responded
rather
quickly--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
because
the,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
time
in
between
these
individual
contacts.
i
mean,
these
contacts
didn't
occur
over
the
course
of
a
week
or
2
weeks.
he
responded
to
the
survey
questions.
for
example,
petitioner
is
right
that
defense
exhibit
102
wasn't
sent
back
through
the
mails,
but
the
survey
was
sent
back
through
the
mails.
it
was
sent
back
to
hint.
and
all
these
other
items
were
sent
back.
they
didn't
indicate
that
he
was
reluctant.
at
no
time
did
he
throw
these
in
the
garbage
can.
at
no
time
did
he
contact
the
police.
these
sort
of
inducements,
if
you
will,
that
the
government
engaged
in
here
are
not
this
type
of
inducements
that
would
break
down
the
will
of
a
reasonable
person.
and
unless
that's
true
you
don't
even
have
inducement.
even
if
you
do,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
initial
evidence
the
government
had
here,
as
well
as
the
evidence
the
government
acquired
during
the
course
of
this
investigation,
were
ample
to
raise
a
jury
question
on
whether
or
not
he
was
predisposed.
and
they
also,
i
think,
amply
satisfied
any
reasonable
suspicion
standard
that
the
court
could
adopt.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
did
not.
they
talked
more
in
terms
of--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
they
didn't
say
when
there
had
to
be
evidence
of
predisposition,
but
what
the
jury
instructions
did
say,
and
they
are
at
pages
11
to
12
of
the
joint
appendix,
say
that
the
predisposition
had
to
arise
before
the
contacts.
so
to
that
extent
the
instructions
were
about
as
favorable
to
the
defendant
as
i
think
he
would
want.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
predis--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--they
had
to
find
that
he
was
predisposed
before
the
contacts.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
if
the
jury
instruction--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
no,
not...
because
the
jury
instructions
in
that
respect
are
probably
more
favorable
to
the
defendant
than
they
needed
be.
the
important
point
on
predisposition,
i
think,
is
this.
it's
a
causation
question.
the
government
can't
cause
the
defendant
to
commit
the
crime.
if
the
predisposition
arises
in
a
defendant
because
the
government
implanted
it
in
the
defendant,
then
the
defendant
is
not
predisposed
and
he
is
not
guilty.
but
you
can
have
a
situation
where
you
have
an
undercover
operation
that
goes
on
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
during
this
entire
course
of
conduct
there
is
evidence
of
different
types
of
transactions
between
the
parties
and
that
evidence
can
be
used
by
the
defendant
to
show
that
he
was
forced
into
committing
this
and
he
wasn't--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that's
right.
the
government
can't
lean
on
you
and
force
you
to
commit
a
crime.
that's
what
the
entrapment
defense
is
designed
to
protect.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
situation
here,
i
think,
where
the
government's
evidence
in
this
case,
considered
as
a
whole,
raised
a
legitimate
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
on
this
issue,
and
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
i
think...
the
way
i
would
read
that,
i
think
it
is
best
read
this
way,
is
the
state
of
mind
has
to
have
arisen
before
that.
but
you
can
rely
on
the
evidence
that
occurs
during
this
course
of
conduct
to
determine
whether
back
at
the
initial
point
he
was
predisposed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
see,
the
predisposition
may
have
to
arise
at
that
initial
point,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
don't
have
to,
you
can't
consider
or
you
shouldn't
consider
all
the
ensuing
evidence.
and
all
the
ensuing
evidence
in
this
case,
i
will
be
ready
to
admit,
confirmed
what
the
postal
service
knew
initially.
there
was
reason
to
suspect
that
petitioner
was
willing
to
purchase
child
pornography
through
the
mail.
and
as
long
as
there
is
a
jury
question,
the
district
court
properly
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury,
and
the
eighth
circuit
properly
affirmed
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
if,
for
example,
the
government,
in,
for
example,
justice
o'connor's
example,
sets
up
the
pawn
shop,
you
have
contact
before
the
predisposition
arises.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
fact
that
he
jumped
at
the
opportunity
is
evidence
of
predisposition.
i
mean,
if
an
undercover
police
officer--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
depends
how
he
did
that.
the
undercover
police
officer--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
sure,
but
in
the
narcotics
example--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no.
it
would
not.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
wouldn't
be
able,
i
think,
in
that
context
to
make
out
that
he...
you
might
not
be
able
to
make
out
that
he
knew
it
was
illegal.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
amount
to
leaning
on
him
in
the
sense
that
i
am
talking
about.
it's
not
leaning
on
him
to
mislead
him.
it's
leaning
on
him
to
take
advantage
of
his
sympathies.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
government
can't
do
it
if
a
police
officer
in
uniform
says,
it's
okay
to
purchase
cocaine,
go
ahead.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
a
crime
for
the
police
officer
to
do
that,
because
he
is
encouraging
somebody
to
break
the
law
and
he
shouldn't.
but
if
it's
an
undercover
officer
and
the
undercover
officer
says
to
somebody
this
is,
you
know,
a
new
designer
drug
and
it's
not
yet
been
listed
on
the
attorney
general's
prescription
list,
prohibited
list,
in
that
context
the
defendant
i
don't
think
is
able
to
say
the
government
misled
him
into
believing
that
he
shouldn't
have
committed
this
crime.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
well,
that
doesn't
amount
to
the
type
of
coercion
that
the
entrapment
defense
is
designed
to
get
at.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
generally
not,
but
it
would
depend,
for
example,
on
the
type
of
action.
if
it
were
one,
for
example,
that
for
some
reason
was
a
malum
in
se
or
that
caused
a
great
deal
of
social
harm
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
you,
in
some
circumstances
you
could
leave
it
to
the
jury.
otherwise
someone
could
make
these
sort
of
contacts
and
with
a
wink
and
a
nod
just
say,
oh,
and
it's
perfectly
legal--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that
is
true,
but
if
there
were
such
a
circumstance
i
wouldn't
want
to
put
beyond
the
possibility
that
the
situation
could
arise.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
most
cases
where
you
have
a
willfulness
crime
you
have
a
situation
in
which
someone
has
to
know
he
is
violating
the
law,
and
where
someone
doesn't
know
he
is
violating
the
law
you
don't
even
get
to
the
entrapment
defense
because
the
government
wouldn't
have
proven
the
basic
elements
of
its
burden
to
show
that
the
person
committed
the
crime.
but
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
no.
and
i'm
not
in
any
way
suggesting
the
court
has
to
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
complicated
case.
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
we
introduced
throughout
the
entire
course
of
conduct
we
think
was
sufficient
to
raise
a
jury
question.
that's
all
that
has
to
be
decided
here,
because
if
you
decide
there
was
a
valid
question
for
the
jury,
the
district
court
acted
properly
in
submitting
the
question
to
the
jury
and
the
eighth
circuit
acted
properly
in
sustaining
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
you
have
to,
you
can
make
that
inference,
but
i
would
also
add,
and
i
think
you
have
left
out
all
the
other
evidence
that
came
in
between.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
the
purchase
from
the
customs
operation,
from
produit
outaouais,
comes
close,
but
it
is
not
as
graphic
as
the
one
from
the
postal
service.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right,
but
what
you
have
is
the
order--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
way
it's
described.
you
don't
have
the
actual
material.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
was
in,
i
think,
march
of
1987.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
certainly
not
essential.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
no.
the
evidence
can
be
acquired
at
a
later
point,
it's
just
that
it
has
to
refer
back
to
that
earlier
point.
you
don't
have
to
have--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--shows
that
he's
predisposed--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--to
sell
the
material.
you
can
use
the
evidence
during
the
course
of
conduct,
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
kennedy.
thank
you.
