justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
the
instructions
said
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did,
was
there
an
objection
to
the
jury
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
entrapment?
justice
byron
r.
white
courts
of
appeals?
but
your
point
is
the
government
should
have
some,
some
kind
of
a
suspicion
that
he,
that
the
target
is
likely
to
break
the
law
by
a
certain
course
of
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
that
he
was
likely...
that
some
time
he
was
engaging
in
this
activity,
but
he
is
likely
to
continue
it
even
though--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
though
he
knows
it's
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
lost
on
your
submission.
so
if
the
case
comes
here,
i
guess
this
point
is
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
raised
the
issue
below
and
you
lost
on
it,
that,
on
the
question
of
knowing
illegality.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
lost
on
it.
you
didn't
bring
that
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
okay.
suppose
we
agree
with
the
lower
court
that
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse,
which
tends
to
be
the
rule.
suppose
we
agree
with
them.
then
the
government...
why
does
the
government
have
to
show
that
this
is
a
person
who
not
only
acquired
child
pornography
before,
but
also
acquired
it
before
knowing
it
was
in
violation
of
the
law?
why
does
it
have
to
prove
that
since
in
order
to
convict
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
he
knew
it
was
in
violation
of
the
law?
all
you
have
to
prove
is
that
he
received
child
pornography.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't,
i
take
it
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
government
didn't
need
to
have
some
basis
for
targeting
this
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some...
there
is
a
predisposition
requirement,
i
suppose,
but
is
that
satisfied
just
by
the
fact
that
he
ultimately
commits
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
in
this
case
they
had
no
evidence,
no
indication
that,
any
of
this
evidence
until
they
targeted
him
and
then
they
finally
induced
him
to
buy.
that
would
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
passive
government
conduct.
they
set
up
the
pawn
shop
all
right,
but
the
only
people
who
come
in
are
people
who
are
interested
in
doing
something.
but
how
about
just
targeting
a
person
and
pursuing
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
ask
you
again,
suppose
that
they
didn't
have
this
evidence
of
his
ordering
these
magazines
before
but
they
just
happened
to
target
this
man
and
pursue
him.
they
did,
they
contacted
him
time
after
time.
finally
he
bought,
and
i
take
it...
and
your
submission
is
that
would
be
just
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
he
had
a
predisposition.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they,
did
the
jury
instructions
define
predisposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
when
there
should
be
evidence
of
a
predisposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
before...
there
had
to
have
been
a
predisposition
before
the
contacts?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
must
find
that
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
it
can
be
used
to
show
that
just
because
he
finally
committed
the
crime
that
there,
that
he
was,
prior
to
the
first
contact,
predisposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that,
i
take
it
that
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
government,
then,
to,
without
any
prior
experience
with
the
person,
to
target
that
person
and
in
the
course
of
things
offer
him
something
and
the
fellow
says,
is
this
legal,
and
the
government
says
of
course
it
is,
and
he
buys.
would
that
be
evidence
of
predisposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
that
sort
of
qualify
as
leaning
on
a
fellow?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
asked,
by
the
way,
i
don't
want
to
commit
a
crime,
but
is
buying
this
stuff
legal,
and
the
government
says
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
that
be
leaning
on
him
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would,
so
he,
so
there
wouldn't...
the
conviction
would
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
it
is
on
the
list.
it
is
on
the
list
and
he
says
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
there
must
be,
there
must
be
some
evidence...
i
guess
the
judge
has
to
be
convinced
that
there's
enough
evidence
to
show
a
predisposition
prior
to
the
first
contact,
but
that
evidence
doesn't
have
to
be
evidence
of
facts
or
conduct
prior
to
the
contact?
justice
byron
r.
white
--his
coming
to
the
pawn
shop
shows
that
he
had
a
pre--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
had
a
predisposition.
