justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
in
your
judgment,
could
your
opponent
have
obtained
a
registration,
have
registered
this
trade
dress?
justice
stevens
it
would
not
be
subject
to
registration?
justice
stevens
now,
are
you
saying
that
about
this
particular
trade
dress,
or
are
you
saying
no
trade
dress
can
be
registered?
justice
stevens
even
if
it
were...
even
if
it's
inherently
distinctive,
it
cannot
be...
it
could
not
be
registered,
and
even
if
it's
nonfunctional
and
nondescriptive.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
sort
of
basic
question.
this
action
is
entirely
under
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act,
correct?
justice
stevens
there
is
no...
they
did
not
allege
a
common
law
cause
of
action
under
a
texas
common
law?
justice
stevens
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible
in
some
states
that
even
though
there's
no
remedy
under
43(a)
they
might
nevertheless
recover
if
the
state
chose
to
give
protection.
justice
stevens
yeah,
does
any
state...
any
circuit
other
than
the
second
circuit
follow
this
rule
of
incipient,
secondary
meaning
or
whatever...
what,
you
know,
developing
secondary
meaning,
or
whatever
you
call
it?
justice
stevens
and
you
think
it's
good
law
or
bad
law?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
in
your
mcdonald's
case,
suppose
they
have
the
golden
arch.
and
the
other
people
didn't
put
up
the
golden
arch.
and
your
opponent
here
has
this
stripe,
and
the
bunch
of
plants
out
in
front
and
some
other
things
that
are
the
substitute
for
the
golden
arch
that
make
it
distinctive.
so
i
don't
think
you
can...
he
isn't
just
relying
on
the
fact
that
they
sell
tacos,
or
whatever
it
is,
instead
of
hamburgers.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
the
golden
arch
is
a
big
part
of
their
unique
picture.
justice
stevens
no,
but
here,
under
the
findings
of
the
jury,
as
i
understand
it,
they,
in
effect,
said
that
the
stripes
and
the
plants,
and
the
way
they
have
the
carports
and
so
on
are
the
equivalent
of
a
golden
arch.
justice
stevens
is
that--
justice
stevens
--but
then
you're
arguing
it's
not
inherently
distinctive.
justice
stevens
different
from
a
trademark.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
factual...
you
said
1983?
justice
stevens
they
used
the
same
inherently
distinctive
design?
justice
stevens
is
it
critical
to
your
case
that
there
was
competition?
supposing
they
had
opened
up
in
california,
alaska,
or
someplace?
could
you
have
enjoined
them
from
opening
in
remote,
noncompetitive
areas?
justice
stevens
suppose
they
travel
through
san
antonio
and
say
boy,
that's
a
good-looking
plan.
and
they
go
to
san
francisco
and
they
open
a
carbon
copy?
justice
stevens
you
think
you
could.
justice
stevens
is
that
essential
to
your
case
that
you
could?
justice
stevens
so
the
heart
of
your
case
does
not
turn
on
copying.
it
turns
on
consumer
understanding
of
the
source.
justice
stevens
one
other
question,
and
then
i'll
let...
could
you
have
registered
your
trade
dress?
justice
stevens
well,
that
goes
to
whether
you
can
register
or
not.
justice
stevens
those
words
aren't
in
section
43(a).
justice
stevens
if
your
whole...
the
whole
statutory
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
your
opponent
has
provided
the
public
with
a
false
designation
of
origin.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
couldn't
you
have
registered
during
those
3
years?
justice
stevens
and
then
have
gotten
your
protection?
justice
stevens
isn't
that
perhaps
the
mistake
that
was
made,
that
you
should
have
registered?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
way
we
granted
certiorari,
maybe
you're
entirely
right.
but
we
sort
of
assumed
that
the
way
the
question
arises,
there's
no
secondary
meaning,
but
there
is
inherent
distinctiveness.
he
doesn't
like
the
inherent
distinctiveness
part;
you
don't
like
the
secondary
meaning.
but
the
legal
question
we
sort
of
plan
to
address
here
is
an
assumption
there
is
no
secondary
meaning
at
all,
that
seems
to
me.
because
you
haven't
proved
secondary...
i
mean,
you
may
be
right.
but
the
record
doesn't
establish
that
there
wasn't
secondary
meaning
even
for
a
small
neighborhood
in
san
antonio.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
basic
question
of
approach
to
the
case?
this
statute
was
enacted
when,
194--
justice
stevens
--1946...
and
it's
kind
of
a
common
law
statute.
i
mean,
it
kind
of
picked
up
the
common
law,
and
the
common
law
has
developed
since.
and
it
sort
of
affects
how
we
address
statutes.
there's
some
disagreement
within
the
court
on
questions
of
this
kind.
do
you
think
that
the
law
in
1946
had
developed
to
the
point
where
you
would
have
prevailed,
or
do
you
rely
largely
on
common
law...
what
i
might
call
common
law
developments
of
this
statute
subsequently?
justice
stevens
earlier
i
asked
you
about
registration.
you
pointed
out
you'd
be
frozen
to
a
particular
concept.
over
a
period
of
years,
can
the
concept
vary
from
time
to
time
in
minor
degrees...
like
you
change
the
uniform
on
the
band
and
you
change
the
plants
in
front
and
move
them
around?
and
are
all
of
the
different
patterns
that
you've
used
throughout
the
period
inherently
distinctive
and
entitled
to
protection?
justice
stevens
or
do
they
have
to
be
just
copying
the
one
you're
using
at
the
particular
time?
justice
stevens
but
you
then...
you
do
take
the
position
you
must
put
on
some
consumer
testimony
to
win
your
case?
you
couldn't
just
let
the
jury
look
at
the
two
designs
and
say
they're
exactly
alike?
