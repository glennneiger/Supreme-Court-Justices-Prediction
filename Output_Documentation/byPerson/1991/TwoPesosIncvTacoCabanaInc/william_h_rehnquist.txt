h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-971,
two
pesos,
inc.
v.
taco
cabana.
mr.
corson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
who
changed
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
it
was
changed
within
the
fifth
circuit
then,
is
what
you're
saying.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
term
inherently
distinctive
one
that
is
found
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
the
fifth
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
uh...
and
what
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
also
say
arbitrary
or
fanciful...
all
those
could
be
included
within
the
meaning
of
inherently
distinctive?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
what,
by
the
common
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
corson.
mr.
taranto,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
secondary
meaning,
though,
in
a
sense
if
you
say
i've
been
there
before,
and--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it's
a
very
esoteric
distinction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
if
taco
cabana
has
a
mariachi
band?
can
two
pesos
put
in
an
identical
mariachi
band
without
infringing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
corson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
could
i
ask
if
you
agree
that
a
trademark
to
be
challenged
after
it's
registered,
yet
you
have
to
prove
that
it's...
that
there's...
has
neither
secondary
meaning
or
is
not...
and
is
not
inherently
distinctive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
corson.
the
case
is
submitted.
