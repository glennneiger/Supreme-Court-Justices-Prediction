justice
souter
--well,
that
finding,
then,
was
that
it
simply
hadn't
acquired
the
meaning
throughout
the
state,
not
that
it
hadn't
acquired
the
meaning
anywhere
in
the
state.
justice
souter
yeah.
justice
souter
but
if
they
had
the
band
in
front
of
the
door,
and
they
all
wore
orange
uniforms
and
orange
hats,
your
answer
would
be
different?
justice
souter
it
also
assumes
that
these
bands
don't
always
wear
orange.
and
i
assume
that's
true.
