mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1983,
taco
cabana
created
and
adopted
an
inherently
distinctive
trade
dress
so
that
consumers
would
come
to
recognize
it
and
associate
it
with
taco
cabana.
in
1985,
before
taco
cabana
had
opened
anywhere
outside
san
antonio,
two
pesos
came
along
and
deliberately
took
the
trade
dress
and
used
it
to
identify
its
competing
restaurants
to
its
consumers.
the
central,
legal
issue
here
is
whether
the
lanham
act
allowed
two
pesos--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
in
houston,
dallas,
el
paso,
and
cities
all
over
the
state...
as
taco
cabana
moved
into
exactly
the
same
markets
that
two
pesos
opened
in.
two
pesos
opened
in
houston
knowing
even
before
they
opened
the
restaurant
that
taco
cabana
was
prepared
to
move
into
that
market.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
the
first
taco
cabana
restaurant
was
1978.
but
that
was
before
it
became
a
chain
at
all.
it
was
a
converted--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
it
was
a
converted
dairy
queen
restaurant
that
was
not
pink,
that
didn't
have
the
garage
doors,
didn't
have
the
two-box
structure.
it
was
only
with
the
opening
of
the
second
restaurant
in
1983...
also
in
san
antonio...
that
this
trade
dress,
which
has
now
been
consistently
used
on
its
couple
of
dozen
restaurants,
was
adopted.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
traditional
rule,
which
has
also
been
applied
under
43(a)
is
that
if
a
competitor
innocently
adopts
a
similar
trademark
or
trade
dress,
in
a
remote
area--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
we
could
have
enjoined
them.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
not
at
all,
because
as
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
said
in
this
case,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
zone
of
the
natural
expansion
of
taco
cabana's
business.
so
that
we
are
not
talking
about
geographically
remote
areas
where
an
entirely
separate,
completely
nonoverlapping
consumer
class
would
be
shopping
at
that
particular
restaurant.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
conceivable
possibility
of--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right,
the
intent
of
two
pesos
is
not
essential
to
a
violation
of
43(a).
the
intent
may
well
be,
and
traditionally
has
been
an
important
element
in
deciding
on
the
available
relief.
and
it
is
in
that
respect
that
the
question
whether
we
could
get
an
injunction
would,
i
think,
turn
on
whether
two
pesos
just
happened
upon
a
look-alike
trade
dress,
or
deliberately
took
the
plans
and
made
it
as
close
as
possible,
with
the
exception
of
changing
the
color.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
we
could.
it
wasn't
done
so.
there
have
been
restaurant
designs,
complete
architectural
plans
that
have
been
registered
as
trademarks.
that
has
not
been
a
traditional
thing
to
do.
and
i
suspect
one
reason
is
that
when
you
register
something,
you
are
registering
something
very
precise.
and
there
are
always
dangers
after
that
that
you
are
frozen
into
exactly
what
has
been
registered,
and
can't
change
anything...
even
at
the
margins
beyond
something
unnoticeable
and
trivial.
i
do
think
that
this
could
have
been
registered,
traditional...
and
as
far
as
i
know
all
of
the
courts
that
have
talked
about
the
issue
have
said
that
trade
dress,
which
is
not
a
statutory
term,
is
in
general...
does,
in
general,
qualify
as
a
trademark.
and
there
is,
therefore,
no
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
subject
to
registration.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
think
that's...
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
the
eighth
circuit
proofrock
case
specifically
applied
the
functionality
requirement
and
said
that
what
was
just
the
so-called
down-home
country
style
was
part
of
what
was
being
sold.
there
was
no
suggestion
there
that
a
more
distinctive
restaurant
design
that
did
serve
the
purpose
of
a
trademark...
namely
to
identify
the
brand...
that
that
couldn't
be
a
trademark.
the
ninth
circuit
case
in
fuddruckers
simply
found
that
that
particular
trade
dress
was
not
inherently
distinctive.
i
think,
in
fact,
inappropriately
so,
since
it
did
not
have
a
jury
finding
on
that
question.
but
even
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that
restaurants,
somehow,
were
incapable
of
having
a
distinctive
trade
dress.
and
that
would,
i
think,
be
really
counter
to
common
experience,
from
howard
johnsons
to
the
international
house
of
pancakes...
there
are
a
lot
of
restaurant
trade
dresses
where
the
appearance,
the
image,
in
that
sense,
of
appearance
is,
in
fact,
a
very
powerful
identifier
of
the
particular
brand
to
consumers.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right,
then--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
probably
not.
because
what
you
would
have
there
is
a
very
powerful
argument
that
that
color
scheme
was
functional,
it
served
a
function
as
part
of
the
product
being
sold
to
the
consumers.
that
was
an
issue
in
this
case,
carefully
instructed
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
specifically
found
that
this
look
of
taco
cabana
was
not
functional.
that
issue
was
carefully
reviewed
by
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it's
not
before
this
court.
what
was
protected
in
this
case
was
not
any
right
to
monopolize
a
product,
anything
that
competitors...
competing
mexican
restaurants
need
in
order
to
compete
with
taco
cabana,
nor
was
anything
protected
that
restricted
other
mexican
restaurants'
ability
to
communicate
with
their
customers,
to
say
we
have
a
mexican
restaurant,
this
is
what
you
can
expect
in
this
restaurant.
the
functionality
standard
and
the
standard
that
the
trade
dress
not
be
merely
descriptive...
the
latter
not
even
argued
to
the
jury
by
two
pesos
in
this
case...
were
presented
to
the
jury.
and
there
are
jury
findings
on
those
precise
questions.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
jury
instruction
on
functionality
is,
in
fact,
a
fairly
length
one,
and
allowed
two
pesos
to
argue
that
what
was...
what
taco
cabana
was
claiming
protection
for
served
any
significant
function
as
part
of
what
it
was
selling
to
the
public,
that
competitors
and
other
mexican
restaurants
needed,
or
reasonably
needed
this
feature...
whatever
it
was...
or
this
combination
in
order
to
offer
a
substitute
product.
and
i
think
that
that's
exactly
what
you're
talking
about
when
you
talk
about
ambiance.
if
another
restaurant
needs
a
particular
design
in
order
to
offer
the
same
ambiance,
and
will
lose
customers
because
customers
think
there's...
i
want
a
certain
atmosphere
tonight,
there's
only
one
place
i
can
get
it,
it's
in
the
orange
room,
nobody
has
an
orange
room...
then
there's
a
strong
argument
for
functionality.
that's
nothing
like
what
we're
talking
about
here.
there--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
because
the
reason
a
trade
dress,
like
a
trademark,
is
adopted
is
not
to
attract
people,
but
to
identify
the
business
to
the
customer,
to
consumers.
so
that
when
people
drive
by
and
see
this
image
they
say
i
know
what
i
get
there.
i've
heard
about
it.
i've
been
there
before.
that's
where
i
can
go
to
get
this
kind
of
mexican--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--secondary
meaning...
we
have
to,
i
think,
be
careful
about
this...
secondary
meaning
is
a
concept
of
widespread
recognition
throughout
a
market,
here
throughout
texas.
any...
with
respect
to
any
particular
customer
who
has
been
to
the
restaurant,
that
image,
if
it
is
distinctive,
inherently
distinctive,
will
register.
but
as
we
have
talked
about
earlier,
a
new
product,
one
by
one,
as
customers
come
to
notice
it,
will
have...
will
make
an
impression.
but
for
a
new
product
you
can't
possibly
achieve
market-wide
recognition.
that's
what
secondary
meaning
is.
that
the
entire
market
in
significant
numbers,
when
it
sees
this
image,
has
some
association
of
that
image
with
the
particular
restaurant.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
the
statute,
in
section
2
of
the
lanham
act
makes
a
very...
makes
exactly
this
distinction,
even
though
it
doesn't
use
these
terms.
the
statute
says
that
you
can
register,
you
can
protect
any
mark,
device,
symbol,
combination
of
devices,
by
which
your
product
may
be
distinguished
from
other
products.
that
is
what
inherent
distinctiveness
is.
anything
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
that's
right.
section
43(a)--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--or
a
false
description
or
a
false
representation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
in
fact,
i
think
all
of
them
do.
i'm
not...
i
wouldn't
insist
on
calling
it
a
false
designation
of
origin
because
in
its
original
meaning,
that
phrase
may
well--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
think
it
does
that.
it
falsely
represents
that
two
pesos
is
in
some
way
affiliated
with
taco
cabana;
it
falsely
represents
when
two...
when
taco
cabana
came
into
houston,
a
few
months
after
two
pesos
opened,
that
taco
cabana
was
the
copycat
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
exactly
right.
there
will
be
some
consumers
in
the
markets
where
taco
cabana
and
two
pesos
are
both
selling
their
services
who
will
be
confused
about
whether
the
two
restaurants
are
affiliated
with
one
another.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
this
case,
i
think,
exactly
illustrates
why
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
in
1985
when
two
pesos
opened
its
restaurant,
taco
cabana
couldn't
have
achieved
state-wide
recognition.
it
had
five
restaurants
in
san
antonio.
people
in
houston,
and
dallas,
and
el
paso
and
other
places,
by
and
large,
never
would
have
heard
of
taco
cabana.
what...
and
then
when
taco
cabana
did
come
into
houston,
and
el
paso
and
other
cities,
it's
hard
to
see...
and
this
is
exactly
what
two
pesos
said
to
the
jury...
it's
hard
to
see
how
people
would
have
recognized
this
trade
dress
as
taco
cabana's...
two
pesos
already
had
it.
so
it
was
the
lack
of
exposure,
of
state-wide
exposure,
and
two
pesos'
preemptive
copying
of
the
trade
dress
that
prevented
its
lack...
that
prevented
it
from
acquiring
state-wide,
widespread
recognition.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
some
evidence...
yes,
i
think
it
is
probably
some
evidence.
and
that
went
to
the
issue
of
functionality
that
was
presented
to
the
jury.
is
it
sufficient
basis
for
an
inference
that
taco
cabana's
trade
dress
couldn't
be
recognized
as
the
symbol
of
its
origin?
i
think
inconceivably...
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
have
market-wide,
long,
unimpaired
exposure
of
a
borderline
distinctive
trade
dress/trademark
and
people
still
don't
recognize
it.
we
had
less
than
3
years
of
very
narrow
exposure
in
one
city
in
texas
before--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--as
i
say,
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--as
i
say,
i
think
we
could
have.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i...
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
a
mistake.
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
as
congress
specifically
provided
when
it
amended
the
1988...
amended
the
statute
in
1988...
all
of
the
courts,
for
25
years
now,
uniformly
recognized
that
there
is
federal
protection
under
the
lanham
act
for
unregistered
marks.
even
the
second
circuit
doesn't
apply
its
secondary
meaning
rule
to
verbal
marks.
and
there's
no
reason
for
a
distinction
between
verbal
marks
and
nonverbal
marks
if
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
basic
requirement
of
section
43(a),
that
there's
been
a
deceptive
and
misleading
representation
to
consumers,
likely
to
confuse
consumers,
and
likely
to
lead
to
harm...
harm
of
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--let
me
try
to
be
careful
about
this.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
not
if
it's
inherently
distinctive.
the
lanham
act
at
section
2
makes
absolutely
clear
that
inherent
distinctiveness
or
secondary
meaning...
one
or
the
other
is
required...
but
not
both.
you
can
attack
a
trademark,
even
a
registered
trademark,
as
lacking
secondary
meaning
only
if
it
is
descriptive,
and
therefore
not
inherently
distinctive.
and
the
category
of
descriptiveness,
as
this
court
said
long
ago
in
the
beckwith
case
is
a
very
narrow
category.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
absolutely.
and
all
that
means
is,
i
think,
something
very
common
sensical.
it
must
be
noticeable
by
consumers,
and
able...
by
virtue
of
being
different
from
the
way
other
businesses
sell
themselves
to
be--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--recognized.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
and
i
think
when
a
competitor
comes
along
and
takes
a
confusing...
uses
a
confusingly
similar
brand
identifier,
whether
it's
a
trade
dress
or
a
trademark,
what
that
does
is
convey
a
deceptive
and
misleading...
there's
a
false
message
of
affiliation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
in
a
way,
we--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--throughout
the
state
of
texas,
that's
exactly
right.
but
that
finding,
as
i
said,
really
has
no
bearing
on
whether
it
was
capable
of
acquiring
that
secondary
meaning
had
it
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
not
been
preempted
by
two
pesos's
confusingly
similar
trade
dress.
so
those
two--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
if
the
question
had
been
put
to
the
jury,
has
taco
cabana's
trade
dress
acquired
secondary
meaning
in
san
antonio,
i
suspect
we
would
have
gotten
a
quite
different
answer.
but
the
question
was
put
on
the
state-wide
market
basis.
and
two
pesos
said
to
the
jury,
you
can't
possibly
find
taco
cabana
is
recognized
state-wide.
they
haven't
been
anywhere
except
san
antonio.
and
we
got
to
the
other
cities
first.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
legal
question
that
this
court
took
to
decide.
and
what
inherent
distinctiveness...
what
the
inherent
distinctiveness
finding
establishes
is
that
the
trade
dress
can,
and
does,
serve
the
function
of
designating
the
origin
of
the
goods
as
a
branded
identifier.
it
plainly
can
do
that.
that's
why
two
pesos,
when
it
took
it,
wrote
into
its
franchise
agreement
that
this
trade
dress,
its
look-alike
trade
dress
was
a
distinctive
and
identifying
trade
dress.
now
the
reason
that's
enough,
and
you
don't
need
widespread
recognition
throughout
whatever
market
you're
talking
about...
be
it
state-wide
or
elsewhere...
simply
follows
from
the
reasons
that
protection
is
offered
in
the
first
place.
protection
of
a
trade
dress
or
a
trademark
of
any
brand
identifier
serves
two
important
functions:
it
protects
consumers'
ability
to
distinguish
goods
so
that
they
can
select
the
ones
they
like
and
the
ones
they
don't
like;
and
because
it
protects
consumers'
ability
to
distinguish
goods,
it
protects
businesses'
ability
to
identify
themselves
to
the
public
and
to
maintain,
control,
and
build
their
own
reputations
based
on
their
own
quality
without
consumers
being
confused.
by
protecting
brand
identifiers,
you
therefore
serve
the
goal
of
competition
on
the
merits
among
clearly
distinguished
brands.
what
happens
when
somebody
like...
a
competitor
like
two
pesos
comes
along
and
copies,
or
uses
a
confusingly
similar
dress
is
that
you
replace
competition
in
the
merits
by
competition
by
deception.
you
send
a
false
message
of
affiliation
to
consumers.
and
the
harms
that
the
lanham
act...
that
any
kind
of
protection
of
brand
identifiers
are
designed
to
prevent...
start
from
the
beginning.
consumers,
one
by
one,
as
they
come
to
know
taco
cabana,
will
be
confused,
and
inhibited
in
their
ability
to
know
that
there
are
two
genuine
competitors...
two
unrelated
restaurants.
mr.
richard
g.

mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think...
let
me
try
to
answer
that
this
way.
the
common
law
categories
in
1946
were
sufficiently
vague
and
amorphous
that
we
would
have
had
an
argument
that
on
these
facts,
the
common
law
should
say
that
inherent
distinctiveness
was
enough.
that
is
simply
because
the
common
law
recognized
two
somewhat
distinct
causes
of
action...
a
so-called
technical
trademark
cause
of
action,
and
the
broader,
kind
of
residual,
unfair
competition
cause
of
action.
as
it
happens,
the
technical
trademark
cause
of
action
was
more
or
less
defined
by
the
presence
of
inherent
distinctiveness.
it
hadn't
come
to
be
applied
to
something
that
we're
calling
a
trade
dress
here.
but
we
would
have
had
an
argument
that
it
could
have
been.
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
the
chevron
case
was
there's
no
reason
why
we
shouldn't.
anything
including
what
we
call
a
trade
dress
that
serves
to
identify
the
brand,
rather
than
to
describe
the
product,
serves
the
same
functions
and
should
be
protected
on
the
same
standard.
now
secondary
meaning,
in
the
end,
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
harm
to
consumers'
ability
to
choose
between
competing
brands
is
present
one
by
one
as
consumers
come
to
be
aware
of
taco
cabana.
the
harm
to
taco
cabana's
ability
to
identify
itself
to
consumers,
and
to
control
its
reputation,
unimpaired
by
confusion,
as
a
result
of
two
pesos
was
there
from
the
beginning.
and
if,
from
a
systemic
point
of
view,
you
had
a
rule
that
said
secondary
meaning,
market-wide,
widespread
recognition
was
required,
what
you
would
have
is
a
perilous
situation
for
any
new
product.
by
definition,
a
new
product
cannot
have
market-wide
recognition
immediately.
if,
in
the
interim,
a
competitor
could...
like
two
pesos...
could
come
along
and
simply
take
the
trade
dress,
the
goodwill
that
the
new
company
was
trying
to
build
up,
customer
by
customer,
would
be
immediately
threatened.
and
what
you
would
have
is
a
serious
inhibition
on
the
creation
of
new
brand
identifiers,
possibly
an
inhibition
on
the
creation
of
new
business,
and
certainly
a
depravation
of
the
informational
benefits
to
consumers
that
having
more
clearly
distinguished
brand
identifiers
provide
to
consumers.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
aside
from
trade
secret
claims,
the
lanham
act
would
say
nothing
whatsoever
about
that.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
product
is
unprotected.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
as
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no
protection
under
the
lanham
act.
yes,
i
think
we
would,
as
we
did
in
this
case,
have
a
common
law
trade
secret
claim,
and
possibly
some
other
claims.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
as
i
say,
the
lanham
act
does
not
restrict
competitor's
right
to
sell,
essentially,
the
same
product...
assuming
it
gets
that
product.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
what
it
protects
is
the
trade
dress.
two
pesos
can
change
the
trade
dress
so
that
it
doesn't
look
like
ours,
and
consumers
are
not
confused,
and
try
to
sell
as
close
a
product
as
possible
in
order
to
compete
for
the
same
consumers.
what
they
can't
do
is
say
to
consumers
through
their
image,
through
their
trade
dress,
we
are
probably
affiliated
with
those
other
guys.
and
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
here
of
actual
confusion
among
consumers.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
but
the
place
in
the
analysis
that
that
would
come
in
would
be
in
the...
would
be
with
respect
to
functionality...
presumably
two
pesos
would
say,
and
have
a
pretty
good
claim,
that
when
you
put
a
band
in
a
restaurant
you
are
now
selling
food
and
entertainment.
and
that's
the
product.
and
we
have
no
right
to
monopolize
the
product.
all
we
have
a
right
to
do
is
to
insist
that
the
way
we
identify
ourselves
to
the
consuming
public,
others
cannot
confusingly
copy.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
might
well
be
different.
it
all
depends
whether,
again,
the
look
was,
in
any
way,
needed
by
competitors
in
order
to
sell
the
same
product...
whether
it
was
functional,
in
that
sense.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
assume
that's
true,
too.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
what--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--what
we
have
to
show,
in
order
to
become
entitled
to
protection,
is
that
they
came
confusingly
close
to
an
image
that
the
consuming
public
can
and
does,
in
small
or
large
numbers,
identify
itself...
our
restaurants
with.
we
have
had
minor
variations,
depending
on
certain
zoning
restrictions
since
the
second
restaurant.
a
restaurant
in
san
diego
used
white
instead
of
pink.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
you
could,
but
it
would
be
risky.
it
seems
to
me
what
you
do
in
order
to
avoid
that
risk
is
to
put
on
the
testimony
of
restaurant
experts,
as
we
did;
taco
cabana
employees
who
have
received
repeated
complaints
from
people
who
had
gone
to
two
pesos
and
called
up
to
say
something
at
your
restaurant
up
in
houston,
or
in
dallas,
i
liked
or
didn't
like...
whatever
it
was.
but
they
were
clearly
associating
the
two
restaurants.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
evidence
to
establish
that
the
trade
dress
is
capable
of
being
identified
with
taco
cabana
if
only
it
wasn't
copied,
and
therefore
subject
to
confusion.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
respectfully
ask
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
