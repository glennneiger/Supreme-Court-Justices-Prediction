if
we
think
that
secondary
meaning
is
not
required
in
a
trade
dress
case,
do
you
lose?
justice
kennedy
so
that
the
brief
for
the
private
label
association
states
the
question
accurately...
it
states
it
differently
than
you
do...
but
it
states
accurately
the
question
that's
before
the
court?
justice
kennedy
so
we
have
to
assume
that
this
would
be
a
protected
trade
dress
if
secondary
meaning
is
not
required?
justice
kennedy
why
was
it
changed?
what
was
the
basis
for
changing
it?
justice
kennedy
was
there
some
agency
involved?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
authority
in
trademark
law
where
such
temporal
protection
is
granted
in
other
instances?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
concession
makes
your
case
much
more
difficult.
because
as
i
think
you
will
agree...
maybe
you
won't
agree...
that
what
we're
concerned
here
with
is
confusion,
not
copying.
justice
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me...
maybe
i'm
wrong...
but
the
rationale
of
your
temporal
protection
is
to
punish
or
prohibit
copying.
justice
kennedy
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
trying
to
explore
the
rationale
for
your
concession
that
there
is
a
limited
period
of
protectability.
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
but
that's
a
copying
rationale,
not
a
confusion
rational.
it
seems
to
me
that
i'm
arguing
your
case
in
that
respect.
justice
kennedy
and
if
i'm
wrong,
please
advise
me.
justice
kennedy
well,
then--
justice
kennedy
well,
i
know,
but
you
can
copy
it
unless
you
can
prove
secondary
meaning.
justice
kennedy
is
the
line
that
you
draw
between
trade
dress
and
other
kind
of
trademarks
what
is
registerable?
justice
kennedy
are
we
going
to
have
problems
in
drawing
lines
between
what
is
a
trade
dress
and
what
is
some
other
type
of
protected
mark?
justice
kennedy
how?
justice
kennedy
so
then
we
have
a
subset
of
trade
dresses.
and
so
this
becomes
just
a
restaurant
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
say
they
have
that
protection
for
6
months,
or
9
months,
or
a
year.
justice
kennedy
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
kennedy
but
isn't
that...
isn't
that
some
evidence,
or
grounds
for
an
inference
that
the
reason
the
competitor
adopted
the
trade
dress
was
because
it
sold...
not
because
it
was
attempting
to
confuse?
justice
kennedy
and
you
give
that
answer
with
respect
to
trade
dress
or
all
trademarks?
justice
kennedy
i
didn't
hear
the
answer--
