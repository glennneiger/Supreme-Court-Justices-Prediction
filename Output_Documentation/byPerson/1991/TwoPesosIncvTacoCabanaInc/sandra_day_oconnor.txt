justice
o'connor
mr.
corson,
i
think
this
case
arose
under
a
previous
version
of
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
justice
o'connor
now,
it's
been
revised.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
under
the
revision
of
this
statute
that
secondary
meaning
always
must
be
shown?
justice
o'connor
but
we
didn't
take
the
case
on
the
question
of
whether
the
restaurant
is
inherently
distinctive
in
its
trade
dress,
did
we?
justice
o'connor
exactly,
yes.
justice
o'connor
so
we
should
just
assume
the
inherently
distinctive
trade
dress,
for
purposes
of
answering
the
secondary
meaning
issue?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
to
have
a
lanham
act
recovery,
you
have
to
be
sure
that
the
item
is
nonfunctional.
justice
o'connor
to
which
the
trade
dress
is
applied.
so
really,
your
focus
of
how
this
concept
should
be
limited
turns
on
how
you
limit
functionality.
justice
o'connor
but
we
don't
have
that
issue
here,
do
we?
justice
o'connor
we
just
took
this
to
decide
whether
secondary
meaning
must
be
required.
justice
o'connor
so
maybe
we
ought
to
talk
about
that
a
little
bit.
justice
o'connor
well,
some
courts
have
found
that
restaurants
just
can't
be
covered.
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
as
it
comes
to
us,
i
assume
that
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
an
inherently
distinctive
trade
dress,
that
it
is
nonfunctional,
and
there
is
no
secondary
meaning.
now,
do
we
assume
all
those
things
to
be
a
given?
