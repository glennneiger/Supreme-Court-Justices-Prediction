mr.
kimball
j.
corson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
justices
of
the
court,
good
morning.
this
is
an
intellectual
property
case.
it
is
a
restaurant
trade
dress
case
under
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
in
broad
terms,
the
issue
before
you
this
morning
is
not
whether
the
two
pesos
restaurant
chain
copied
the
appearance
of
the
taco
cabana
restaurant
chain.
it
is,
instead,
a
different
issue.
it
is
whether
taco
cabana
has
a
publicly
recognized
and
understood
appearance
that
may
not
be
copied.
it
is
a
question
of
protectability
under
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
if
taco
cabana
does
not
have
a
protectable
trade
dress,
the
issue
of
copying
is
not
involved,
and
there
can
be
no
actionable
confusion
under
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
it
protects
an
original,
recognized
source
of
origin.
that's
what
43(a)
does.
if
it
is
not
recognized
by
the
public,
then
there
is
no
issue
of
confusion.
you
do
not
reach
the
likelihood
of
confusion
issue
under
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
revisions
of
the
act
were
largely
in
regard
to
the
disparagement
issue,
and
do
not
affect
the
language
that
is
key
and
relevant
to
this
case.
we
still
have,
in
the
revised
act,
the
language
that
says,
any
person
who,
or
in
connection
with
any
goods
or
services...
skipping
some
material...
uses
in
commerce
any
false
designation
of
origin...
and
that
gets
back
to
the
issue.
if
we're
talking
about
a
false
designation
of
origin,
which
is
what
was
pled
in
this
case,
the
infringement
of
which
was
the
basis
of
the
judgment,
then
we
are
still
dealing
with
the
issue
of
secondary
meaning.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
i
believe
it
does,
but
with
contextual
variation.
it's
more
general
than
we
posit
it.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
issue
of
secondary
meaning
has
historically
been
required
for
trade
dresses.
that
has
been
the
rule
for
many,
many
years.
it
was
in
the
chevron,
fifth
circuit
case
that
that
rule
was
changed.
and
it
was
changed,
interestingly
enough,
for
a
little,
tiny
label
that
really
was
quite
unique.
it
may
well
have
been
considered
a
trademark.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
the
basis
for
changing
it
was
not
well
articulated,
sir;
it
was
simply
the
judgment
that
on
viewing
it,
it
was
arbitrary
or
fanciful.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
the
fifth
circuit...
the
judgment--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--yes,
de
novo,
on
de
novo...
basically
under
a
de
novo
standard
it
was
viewed.
it
was
determined
to
be
inherently
distinctive,
and
that
was
largely
the
end
of
the
discussion.
the
difficulty
that
crops
up
in
making
those
judgments
is
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
look
at
a
trade
dress
and
be
able
to
tell
whether
it
is
inherently
distinctive.
this
is
a
problem
the
united
states
trademark--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--not
that
i
recall,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
had
been--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--no,
sir.
it
was
based
on
a
sentiment
that
it
would
be
nice
to
bring
trade
dress
law
into
conformity
with
trade
law...
trademark
law.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
it
did
not
discuss
that,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
i
believe
it's
on
the
question
really
of
whether
secondary
meaning
is
required.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
and
i
think
the
notion--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--that
is
a
difficult
proposition
that
has
caused
confusion
in
the
case,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
correct.
but
there's
a
problem
of
semantics.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
if
it
is
not
inherently
distinctive,
of
necessity
you
have
to
address
the
question
of
inherent
distinctiveness.
the
argument
would
also
be...
and
mine
is
a
little
different
here...
it
is
that
even
if
it
is
inherently
distinctive,
all
we
are
really
saying
when
we
use
those
words...
and
it's
a
bad
bit
of
nomenclature...
is
that
we
will,
from
its
appearance
only,
presume
that
it
is
distinctive.
and
the
difficulty
we
have
in
this
case
is
that
that
presumption
was
resoundingly
defeated
by
the
actual
evidence.
because
the
evidence
came
in
and
said,
in
the
texas
market
there
is
no
recognition
of
this
trade
dress.
so
we
wind
up,
then,
with
a
very
nominal
situation
of
a
mark
being
by...
as
judged
from
its
appearance,
be
inherently
distinctive.
it
has
no
distinctiveness
at
all.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
the
difficulty,
sir,
is
that--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--depending
on--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
and
that's
why
i
address
that
issue
as
the
incipiency
problem.
and
in
that
context,
for
a
limited
period
of
time...
only
for
the
time
that's
reasonably
necessary
for
that
trade
dress
to
become
recognized
if
it
will,
there
should
be
a
recognition
of
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
circuit
rule.
beyond
that
period
of
time,
then
the--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--the
second
circuit
rule.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes,
sir.
but
not
for
11
years,
as
we
have
here.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
sir,
no
sir.
there
is
a
practice
in
the
second
circuit
district
courts
of
attempting
to
develop
a
doctrine
called
secondary
meaning
in
the
making.
and
it
recognizes
the
sentiment
that
at
the
outset
you
have
precisely
this
problem.
and
that
there
should
be
some
limited
protection
afforded.
so
what
they
want
to
do
is
afford
secondary
meaning
on
a
presumption
basis
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
after
which
secondary
meaning
must
be
proven.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
sir,
i
believe
the
argument
is
a
narrow
one.
we
do
not
reach
the
issue
of
confusion.
if
there
is
not
a
determination
that
taco
cabana's
restaurant
chain
trade
dress,
after
11
years
of
use
in
the
marketplace,
is
not
protectable.
you
must
make
a
determination
of
the
protectability
of
that
mark
before
you
can
ever
reach
the
confusion
issue.
that
has
to
be
done...
unless
there
is
some
rule
adopted,
like
is
proposed
here,
that
there
be
a
limited
incipiency
trade
protection.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
the
rationale
for
it
is
exactly
the
fact
that
if
somebody
comes
into
a
market,
they
are
fresh
and
new
to
the
market,
they
develop
a
trade
dress
which
is
highly
unusual,
that
for
a
limited
period
of
time
they
should
be
afforded
some
protection.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
because
they
have
spent
time,
and
money,
and
energy
in
developing
that...
and
because
one
of--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--and
because,
sir--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--okay,
and
because...
i'm
going
to
bring
something
else
to
it
at
this
point...
and
because
as
looking
at
it
from
the
appearance,
a
judgment
can
be
reasonably
made
that
it
is
arbitrary,
fanciful,
or
suggestive.
and
therefore,
should
be
cloaked
with
the
protection
of
a
presumptive,
inherent
distinctiveness...
or
presumptive
distinctiveness,
for
that
limited
period
of
time,
to
let
itself
get
on
its
feet.
that's
the
thrust
of
all
the
district
court
cases
in
new
york
that
are
trying
to
provide
secondary
meaning
in
the
making.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
this
case
is
distinguished.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
right
after
that
there
would
be
a
requirement
that
secondary
meaning
be
proved.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
right.
if
the
other
side
cannot
prove
secondary
meaning,
and
you
can
disprove
it,
it's
had
its
chance
in
the
marketplace
and
the
time
and
effort
and
the--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--it
means
the
public
recognizes
that
the
trade
dress
is
a
symbol
of
an
exclusive
origin
for
the
goods
and
services
sold
in
connection
with
it.
the
public
understands
that.
even
a
purely,
inherently
distinctive
mark
has
to
have
that
recognition
at
some
point.
it
has
to
be
recognized
by
the
public.
if
it's
used
and
used
and
used,
and
the
public
doesn't
recognize
it,
it's
a
real
problem.
here
we
have
the
difficulty
that
this
trade
dress
is
inherently
descriptive.
you
place
any
mortal
in
front
of
a
taco
cabana
restaurant,
and
ask
him
what
it
is,
he
won't
tell
you
it's
a
trademark.
he'll
tell
you
it's
a
restaurant.
its
primary
meaning
is
that
it's
a
restaurant.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
there
is
a
finding
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
secondary
meaning,
sir,
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
was
in
the
district
court.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
sir,
it's
judicial
gloss.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
um...
from
trademark
law
and
the
common
law
that
antedates
the
statute.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
it
means
that
we,
from
the
appearance
of
this
particular
mark,
trade
dress,
what
you
will,
infer
that
it
is
arbitrary
or
fanciful,
as
those
terms
are
used
in
trademark
law,
so
that
we
will
say
it
is
inherently
distinctive,
or
we
will
give
it
a
presumption
of
distinctiveness.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
would
be
a
way,
too.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
there's
a
problem
with
the
language.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
technically
it's
arbitrary,
fanciful,
or
suggestive...
those
three
are
historically
the
ones
that--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--that
is
common
law
heritage
that's
been
codified.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
precisely
the
problem.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
it
has
functional
characteristics.
the
problem
we
have
here
is
we're
dealing
with
a
whole
restaurant
appearance.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
little
logo,
or
a
little
mark,
or
a
name,
or
what
the
public
traditionally
recognizes
as
an
identifier.
we
are
dealing
with
a
whole
restaurant
appearance.
and
when
you
deal
with
a
whole
business
appearance
or
with
a
whole
product
appearance,
different
rules
apply.
because
then
you
have
the
problem
of
inherent
descriptives.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
the
analogy
is
packaging,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
packaging.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
packaging
for
the
product.
yes,
i
think
this...
the
ambiance
of
the
restaurant,
the
whole
package
there
is
analogous,
as
it
were,
to
a
wrapper
on
a,
or
a
label
on
a
fertilizer
jar.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
correct,
because
it
would
be
denied
the
presumption
on
the
basis
of
its
appearance.
and
in
that
instance
it
should
not
have
an
incipiency.
it
has
to
pass
first
muster
of
being
on
the
basis
of
its
appearance,
inherently
capable
of
being
presumed
distinctive.
if
it
doesn't
pass
muster,
then--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--if
that's
the
case--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--if
that's
the
case,
justice
scalia,
then
what
you
are
doing
is
protecting
the
delivery
of
a
product,
and
making
the
provision
of
that
particular
product
exclusive
to
one
source
so
that
the
competitors
may
not
sell
that
product.
and
that
is
a
fundamental,
massive
limitation
on
competition.
consider
an
example:
let's
say
you
had
mcdonald's,
15
or
20
years
ago.
it
had
pretty
much--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--if
you--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--if
you
take
his
position,
you
can't
sell
that
product.
if
the
product
is
the
ambiance
and
all
that's
included,
the
total
commercial
concept
that
a
competitor
is
precluded
from
that
market
and
a
monopoly
is
afforded
judicially,
and
circumstances
that
are
contrary
to
congressional
policy
of
allowing
trademarks
to
aid
competition
and
minimize
monopoly.
so
fundamental
congressional
purpose
is
destroyed
there,
if
that's
the
case.
and
that's
the
problem
with
protecting
commercial
concepts.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
right.
secondary
meaning
is
necessary
for
trade
dresses
that
have
been
in
use.
because
otherwise,
the
court,
if
it
renders
a
decision
to
the
contrary,
would
be
in
the
business
of
protecting
whole
business
images,
whole
product
images
which
are
not
recognized
by
the
public,
and
serve
no
identifying
function
at
all.
and
that
has
very
serious
competitive
implications.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
you
can
avoid
that
problem.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
in
regard
to
trade
dress,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
are
some
types
of
trade
dress
which
can
be
registered.
so
the
line
doesn't
need
to
get
drawn
there.
but
the
line
ought
to
be
drawn,
very
hard
i
believe...
if
the
court
wants
the
narrowest
possible
decision...
in
regard
to
whole
business
image
trade
dresses
and
whole
product
image
trade
dresses.
because
they
have
the
most
serious
consequences
for
competition.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
this
would
become
a
whole
business
image
trade
dress
case.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
not
in
a
million
years,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
it
would
not
be
subject
to
registration.
an
examiner
would
look
at
it.
he
would
say
it's
inherently
distinctive,
it's
loaded
with
functional
features,
it's
loaded
with
a
mexican
decor
which
describes
the
food
type
and
origin
of
the
recipes.
and
it
has
anticompetitive
consequences,
and
you
can't
prove
to
me
it
has
secondary
meaning.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
this
particular
trade
dress,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
if
it
were
registered...
assume
it
was
inherently
distinctive,
and
it
was
registered,
there
could
be
a
litigation,
immediately
thereafter,
which
would
rebut
the
presumption
if
it
could
be
proved
it
had
no
secondary
meaning.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
correct,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
i
believe
they
did,
but
it
folded
in
under
the
43(a)
section.
and
the
focus
has
been
on
43(a)
because
the
common
law
brings
nothing
additional
to
it.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
is
correct,
and
new
york
would
be
an
example.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
sir,
the
new
york
district
courts
are
grappling
with
it;
the
second
circuit
does
not
know
what
it
thinks
of
it
very
clearly
just
yet.
the
eight
circuit
has
said
no
to
it,
the
others
haven't
come
to
grips
with
it.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
i
think
for
a
trade
dress
that
on
the
face
of
it
qualifies
as
being
arbitrary
and
fanciful
for
a
limited
period,
some
protection...
not
in
the
form
of
lost
profits
from
diverted
customers,
but
simply
some
portion
of
development
costs
might
be
reasonable.
but
in
this
case
where
we
have
a
trade
dress
used
for
11
years,
no
way.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes,
sir...
no,
technically,
trade
dress
ought
to
be
limited
to
appearance.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
justice
white,
that
is
precisely
a
problem
with
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case.
they
dealt
with
image
when
trade
dress
has
historically
dealt
with
appearance.
and
what
we
should
be
talking
about
is
not
somebody's
reputation,
and
not
some
business's
reputation,
but
the
appearance.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
a
problem.
in
fact,
it
has
very
many
different--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--it
doesn't
have
secondary
meaning
because
there's
too
many
images.
you
can
look
at
it
from
the
front;
you
can
look
at
it
from
the
side;
you
can
look
at
it
from
the
interior.
and
in
the
mcmillan
second
circuit
case,
the
second
circuit
there
said
there
was
no
protectability.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
say
again,
sir?
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
right.
but
the
problem
here
is
it
was
in
regard
to
a
little,
tiny
label...
all
of
which
could
be
taken
in
at
a
glance.
here
you
have
an
entire
restaurant,
that
to
be
viewed
by
a
human
being
has
to
be
viewed
from
many
different
perspectives.
and
the
second
circuit
says
if
you've
got
too
many
images,
you
don't
know
which
one
is
going
to
serve
as
an
identifier,
and
the
public's
not
likely
to
pick
up
on
any
one.
and
that's
the
parone
v.
mcmillan
case,
where
they
tried
to
deal
with
babe
ruth's
photograph.
it
was
a
registered
mark.
and
there
were
other
photographs
that
they
wanted
to
preclude
use
of
without
their
consent.
and
the
court
said
no.
there's
too
many
images
here
for
any
one
to
be
recognized
by
the
public
as
an
identifier.
and
we're
not
going
to
afford
it
protection.
and
they've
got
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
restaurants.
an
example
i'd
like
to
turn
to
now
is
the
one
involving
mcdonald's
that
i
mentioned
earlier.
consider
it
15
or
20
years
ago
that
mcdonald's
had
decided
that
it
wanted
to
protect
its
total
business
image
as
a
trade
dress.
and
assume
further
that
the
second
circuit
law
did
not
apply,
and
that
the
law
of
the
land
was
that
in
chevron.
at
that
time,
mcdonald's
had
pretty
much
covered
the
united
states.
it
was
in
the
process
of
filling
in
in
geographical
locations,
but
it
hadn't
done
it
all.
its
competitors,
on
the
other
hand,
burger
king,
jack-in-the-box,
and
others,
were
coming
after.
and
they
were
coming
into
new
territories
at
that
juncture.
now,
if
mcdonald's
had
a
protectable
business
image
trade
dress
in
regard
to
its
restaurant
appearance...
and
let's
say
it
had
gotten
some
for
some
of
its
products
as
well,
whole
product
image
trade
dresses,
and
it
had
protection
for
those...
can
you
imagine
what
it
could
have
done
for
its
competition?
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
oh,
but
this--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--they're
well
past
that,
sir.
they're
well
beyond
it.
i
mean
if
we're
talking
15
or
20
years,
we're
past
that
period
of
time.
that
would
be
only
for
the
start-up.
they're
there.
they
would
be
able,
in
that
instance,
because
others
would
be
coming
new
to
the
marketplace,
let's
say
moving
into
kansas,
to
be
totally
precluded.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
a
fair
judgment.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
also
a
descriptive--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--no,
and
also
descriptive
characteristics.
those
are
the
essences
of
what's
required
to
not
be
in
the
appearance
in
order
for
it
to
be
inherently
distinct.
it
can't
be
descriptive.
it
can't
be
identifiable
as
something
else.
and
here
it's
identifiable
as
a
restaurant.
it
can't
be
identifiable--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--sir,
mcdonald's
did
it
differently.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
very
much.
they
did
not
try
to
protect
their
image
as
a
business.
they
said
we're
going
to
go
get
some
separate
and
distinct
identifying
feature.
and
they
used
the
golden
arches...
which
were
originally
part
of
the
sides
of
the
restaurant.
and
they
pulled
them
out
front,
turned
them
into
a
big
m,
made
them
as
large
as
zoning
ordinances
will
allow.
and
that
is
their
identifying
symbol.
they
wanted
some
protection
in
regard
to
their
identity.
they
wanted
recognition
in
regard
to
their
identity.
and
that's
what
they
did.
they
didn't
rely
on
their
business/restaurant
image,
which
is
what
taco--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--but
they're
not.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
the
public--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--the
public
doesn't
recognize
the
appearance
of
their
restaurant.
the
public
recognizes
the
golden
arches.
and
it
is
public
recognition
which
is
essential
to
the
protectability.
for
a
trade
dress,
there
has
to
be
public
recognition
before
there's
anything
to
protect.
if
the
public
doesn't
recognize
it,
it's
not
protectable.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
because
it
doesn't
serve.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
you
have
two
questions.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
i'll
answer
the
last
one
first.
the
last
one,
basically
is
that
you
can
challenge
a
trademark
as
not
having
secondary
meaning
and
knock
it
out
of
the
water.
and
in
regard
to
the...
the
first
one,
could
you
repeat
it,
sir?
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
a
fair
criticism.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
exactly
right.
thank
you.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
sir,
if
it's
inherently
distinctive,
it
may
be
challenged
on
the
ground
that
it's
functional
or
descriptive
and
contains
those
elements.
if
it
is
not
inherently
distinctive,
but
registered,
it
may
be
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
it
has
not
secondary
meaning.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
i'll
try
again.
[laughter]
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
that
should
be
enough,
yes.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
no,
if
you
prove
it
has
second...
if
you
prove
it
has
no
secondary
meaning,
what
you
have
proved
is
that
the
public
doesn't
recognize
this
as
a
mark.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
i
do,
i
do.
i
think
there
has
to
be
recognition.
there's
a
fundamental
disagreement--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--certainly
as
to
trade
dress;
and
with
respect
to
trademarks
i
can
go
that
far,
also,
sir.
i
think--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--i
think
i'd
go
that
far,
also.
you've
got
nothing
to
protect.
there's
a
fundamental
disagreement
here.
he's
arguing
that
all
you
need
to
get
to
is
to
show
that
there
is
some
possibility
here
that
the
trade
dress
has
become
confusingly
close.
that's
not
the
issue.
the
primary
issue
is
you
must
show
that
you
have
a
protectable
trade
dress,
and
you
can't
do
that
if
it
isn't
recognized,
because
the
language
of
the
act
under
which
this
case
was
brought
is
false
designation
of
origin.
and
if
the
original
origin
isn't
recognized,
then
there
can
be
no
misstatement
about
it.
if
none
of
you
know
about
something
and
i
make
a
statement
to
you
about
it,
it
can't
be
judged
true
or
false.
that's
the
point.
this
protects
against
false
designation
of
origin.
and
if
the--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--i
think...
no,
it
has
to
be
recognized...
recognition
generally
in
the
marketplace.
it's
not
limited
just
to
a
few
people
who
have
happened
to
patronize
the
unit.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
two
points...
it's
judicial
gloss,
in
part;
and
also,
if
you
look
to
section
2
of
the
act,
they
clearly
preclude
the
registration
of
a
mark
without
proof
of
secondary
meaning
unless
it's--
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
--that's
true.
mr.
kimball
j.
corson
yes.
but
it
cannot
be
an
inherent...
it
cannot
be
a
descriptive
mark
or
a
functional
mark,
or
it's
not
entitled
to
registration
under
the
act
because
it
doesn't
have
secondary
meaning
in
those
instances.
