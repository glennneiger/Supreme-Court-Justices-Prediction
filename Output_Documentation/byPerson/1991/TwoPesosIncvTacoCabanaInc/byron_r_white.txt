justice
white
did
it
overturn
any
prior
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
white
it
wasn't
based
on
any
change
in
the
statute?
justice
white
and
it
recognized
that
it
was
in...
contrary
to
other
circuits,
or
not?
justice
white
was
it?
justice
white
yeah,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
you
lose
if
we
decide
secondary
meaning
is
not
necessary.
justice
white
well,
if
it
wasn't
inherently
distinctive,
you
never
even
get
to
secondary
meaning,
do
you?
justice
white
well,
i
would
think...
i
would
think
here...
i
think
any...
based
on
trade
dress
would
be
almost
impossible
to
prove
if
you
require
secondary
meaning
in
the
case
of
a
new
business.
justice
white
is
that
right?
it
would
be
awfully
hard.
justice
white
wouldn't
you
hate
to
be
recognized...
trying
to
prove
a
secondary
meaning
on
behalf
of
a
restaurant
chain
that
had
just
started
out,
or
just
one
restaurant?
justice
white
it
would
be
kind
of
tough.
justice
white
do
you
see
that...
do
you
think
that's
a--
justice
white
--the
fifth
circuit
would
be
right
for
6
months
or
so?
justice
white
--it's
wrong
to
immediately
copy
a
new
trade
dress
that
is
highly
unusual?
you
can't
copy
it
for
6
months
or
1
year,
but
right
after
that
you
can
copy
it?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
secondary
meaning
means?
justice
white
it...
and
there's
a
finding
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
secondary
meaning?
justice
white
was
that
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
oh,
when
you
said
a
while
ago,
you
described
it
as
highly
unusual.
justice
white
and
highly
unusual.
justice
white
well,
then
i
don't
understand,
again,
your
concession
about
a
temporary
protection...
if
it's
just
descriptive
or
functional.
i
would
suppose
you
could
copy
it
from
the
outset.
justice
white
you
can
sell
the
same
kind
of
a
product,
you
just
can't
copy
the
other
fellow's
ambiance.
justice
white
you
can
have
your
own.
justice
white
you
say
if
it's
just
a
matter
of
business
image
there
can
be
no
protection.
what
is
having
a
business
image?
how
does
that...
is
there
any...
does
that
mean
anything
other
than
what
the
public
looks
at?
justice
white
if
you
said
what
is
your
image,
i
would
think
it's
what
people
think
of
you,
or
what...
how
people
look
at
you.
justice
white
you
say
if
this
chain
of
restaurants
has
an
image
in
the
public
mind,
what
is
it?
it's--
justice
white
--i
know,
but
why
isn't
it
secondary
meaning?
justice
white
the
circuit
looks
at
it
in
totality.
justice
white
the
fifth
circuit
doesn't
just
look
at
one
thing
or
the
other.
i
think
it's
the
totality.
justice
white
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
there
would
be
a
6
months
when...
all
you
want
us
to
say
it
can't
be
11
years.
justice
white
--your
client?
justice
white
where?
justice
white
well,
why
would
your
client
spend
all
this
money
on
a
so-called
trade
dress
if
people
didn't
really...
if
it
really
didn't
think
people...
it
was
going
to
attract
people
and
it
would
mean
that
they
would
come
there
rather
than
someplace
else?
justice
white
which
do
you
rely
on
mostly
in
43?
what
particular
words
do
you
think
support
your
case?
justice
white
and
you
wouldn't
insist
on
saying
it
tends
falsely
to
describe
or
represent
the
same?
justice
white
it
falsely
represents...
representing
it
to
somebody.
and
i
take
it
you
would
be
talking
about
some
section
of
the
public.
it
may
not
be
market-wide.
but
to
some
people,
it
would
be
a
false
representation.
justice
white
i'm
not
sure,
then,
why
you're
so
terribly
harmed
by
our
adopting
the
requirement
that
a
secondary
meaning
is
required.
justice
white
is
there
some
requirement
in
trademark
law
that
the
mark
acquire
a
secondary
meaning?
justice
white
if
i...
say...
may
i
attack
a
registered
mark
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
have
a
secondary
meaning?
justice
white
what
is
the...
what
does
inherently
distinctive
mean?
do
you
agree
then
in
this
case
that...
that,
or
in
a
case
like
this
the
trade
dress
must
be
inherently
distinctive?
justice
white
but
to
win
under
this--
justice
white
--statute,
this
section,
you've
got
to
prove
that
it's
a
false
representation
to
people.
justice
white
and
it
also
makes
it
impossible
for
you
to
acquire
a
secondary
meaning.
justice
white
so
i
take
it
you
don't
challenge...
wasn't
there
a
finding
that
you
had...
your
client
had
never
acquired
a
secondary
meaning
in
this--
justice
white
suppose
all
you
had...
suppose
there
wasn't
any
distinctive
trade
dress,
but
you
had
distinctive
food
in
the
sense
that
it
was
awfully
good
mexican
food.
and
people
got
to
know
that
the
taco
chain
had
good
food.
and
the...
your
competitor
came
along
and
copied
every
recipe.
justice
white
so
i--
justice
white
--so
they
could
steal...
they
could
steal
all
your
recipes
and
copy
your
recipes?
justice
white
and
you
would
have
no
protection
for
it?
justice
white
oh,
i
know,
but...
you're
not
talking
about
a
trade
secret.
they...
they
just
happened
to
have
hired
your
chef.
justice
white
with
whom
you
didn't
have
a
contract
not
to
compete.
justice
white
but
that
is
if
you
sell
it...
if
you
sell
it
in
the
context
of
a...
of
a
trade
dress
that
is
uniquely--
justice
white
well,
here's...
did
you
answer
my
question,
really?
i
didn't
think
you
did.
justice
white
well,
here's
a
mark;
here's
a
mark;
and
somebody
wants
to
challenge
it.
and
he
proves
that
it
doesn't
have
any
secondary
meaning.
now,
that
isn't
enough,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
i
thought...
i
thought...
i
thought
he
also
had
to
prove
that
it
didn't...
that
it
wasn't
inherently
distinctive.
justice
white
then
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side.
justice
white
--well,
what
if
it's
a...
there's
a
false
representation
to
maybe
100
people,
but
no
more?
it
isn't
secondary
meaning,
but
it's
100
people.
justice
white
so
here...
but
there
is
nothing
in
43
that
even
mentions
secondary
meaning.
all
it
says
is
it
has
to
be
a
false
representation.
it
doesn't
say
how
many,
state-wide,
or
for
a
block--
justice
white
--well,
this
isn't
a
mark.
that
doesn't
have
to
be
a
mark.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
trade
dress
and
that
says...
i
gather
you
agree
a
trade
dress
can
be
protected
under
43?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
case
is
91-971
two
pesos
against
taco
cabana
international.
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justices
stevens
and
thomas
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
