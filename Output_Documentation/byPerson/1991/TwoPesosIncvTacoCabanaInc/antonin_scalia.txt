justice
scalia
mr.
corson,
does
any
of
these
cases
that
involve
trade
dress
involve
restaurants
as
well?
i
have...
most
trade
dress
serves
no
function
except
to...
except
to
identify
the
product.
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case.
in
the
case
of
a
restaurant,
the
trade
dress
is
the
product,
it's
not
just
an
identification.
justice
scalia
and
you're
paying
some
money
for
the
food,
and
you're
paying
some
money
for
the
ambiance.
it's...
does
that
mean
that
it's
functional?
is
that
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
it's
functional?
justice
scalia
well,
a
whole
business...
i
mean
macy's
might
have
a
distinctive
macy's
look
about
the
store.
but
i'm
not
buying
the
store.
i
don't
pay
money
to
go
and
look
at
macy's.
i
do
pay
money
to
go
and
sit
in
that
restaurant,
in
that
particular
environment,
right?
it's
called--
justice
scalia
--is...
the
analogy
is--
justice
scalia
--packaging.
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
it
is
packaging.
i
think
you're
disagreeing.
you're
saying
it
is
packaging?
i
think
you're
talking
about
the
substance
of
what's
being
sold.
you're
selling
atmosphere
and
food,
the
two
of
them.
you
can
have
wonderful
food
in
a
lousy
atmosphere.
i'm
not
going
to
pay
as
much
money.
justice
scalia
this
is
not
the
package.
this
is
what
i'm
paying
for.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
seem...
i
think
what
justice
kennedy's
saying
is
it
doesn't
seem
any
more
reasonable
to
protect
it
for
6
months
than
it
does
for
a
longer
period.
justice
scalia
i
mean...
yeah,
but
the
problem
you're
addressing,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
problem
of
functionality.
the
reason
it
seemed
bad
is
that
you're
talking
a
functional
characteristic.
justice
scalia
but
that's
out
of
this
case.
justice
scalia
why
is
it
different
from
a
trademark
in
that
regard?
and
why
do
you
propose
that
we
adopt
some
initial
6-month
protectability
for
new
trade
dress,
although
we
don't
do
that
for
trademarks.
i
mean,
we
protect
them
indefinitely,
not
just
for
6
months.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
i...
you're
proposing
a
system
for
protecting
trade
dress
to
handle
the
incipient
trade
dress.
you
say
it
should
get
some
imperfect
kind
of
protection
for
6
months
or
some
short
period?
we
don't
do
that
for
trademarks.
why
should
we
read
that
difference
into
the
lanham
act?
it
doesn't
treat
trade
dress
any
differently
from
the
other
two.
justice
scalia
it
is
a
fair
criticism.
justice
scalia
i
know
if
i
go
into
a
howard
johnsons
it's
likely
to
look
a
certain
way.
but
i
wouldn't...
if
i
walk
into
another
restaurant
that
looks
somewhat
like
it,
i
wouldn't
say
boy,
they
have
stolen
this
from
howard
johnsons.
i
mean,
that's
the
difference.
suppose
i'm
a
restauranteur
and
i
find
that
people
eat
a
lot,
and
really
like
to
eat
in
a
room
that's
entirely
orange,
all
right?
[laughter]
so
i
do
that,
and
i
set
up
a
restaurant,
and
it
turns
out
i'm
right.
people
really...
it
just
makes
food
taste
better.
other
restaurants
begin
to
open.
it
attracts
people.
they
buy
the
orange
restaurant.
justice
scalia
that
is
a,
somehow,
a
lanham
act
violation?
justice
scalia
did
they
mean
by
functionality
exactly
what
i
mean,
that
is
that
people
go
to
the
restaurant
just
because
they
like
that
decor?
