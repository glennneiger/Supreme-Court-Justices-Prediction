we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-5843,
dennis
sochor
v.
florida.
mr.
caldwell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it's
an
advisory
verdict.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
here
it
was
not
a
life
verdict,
was
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we've
had
a
couple
of
cases
earlier
on,
spaziano
and
then
per
curiam
several
years
later,
kind
of
explaining
what
we
thought
that
process
was.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
it
starts
out:
in
summary,
it
is
the
conclusion
of
the
court,
after
carefully
and
conscientiously
weighing
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
that
there
are
sufficient
aggravating
circumstances
to
justify
and
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
and
that
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances?
where
do
you
find
the
ambiguity
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
is
certainly...
you
have
to
read
something
else
from
an
earlier
part
of
the
paragraph
in
to
bring
an
ambiguity
to
that
sentence:
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
phrase
to
outweigh
might
modify
mitigating.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
this
was
not
a
life
verdict.
chief
justice
rehnquist
excuse
me.
you're
on
the...
you
did
not
object
at
trial
to
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
caldwell.
ms.
snurkowski,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
snurkowski.
mr.
caldwell,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
sure
if
there
are,
justice
scalia
will
ask
them.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
caldwell.
the
case
is
submitted.
