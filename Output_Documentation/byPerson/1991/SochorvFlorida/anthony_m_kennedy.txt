justice
kennedy
and
florida's
rule
is
that
you
must
in
any
event
make
a
specific
objection
to
the
instruction
or
there
is
a
procedural
bar?
justice
kennedy
why
wasn't
it
invoked
here?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
and
that,
under
florida
law,
can
be
a
procedural
bar
if
it's
invoked
by
the
appellate
court.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
and
suppose
the
appellate
court
here
said
we
find
there
is
a
procedural
bar.
as
an
alternate
ground,
we
find
the
claim
has
no
merit.
would
that
have
been
adequate
to
prevent
our
review?
justice
kennedy
and
the
reason
is?
justice
kennedy
yes.
where
there's
plain
error.
fundamental
error
or
plain
error?
justice
kennedy
perhaps
i'm
under
an
misimpression.
i
had
thought,
under
the
florida
system,
that
as
the
jury
returns
the
recommendation
of
life,
that
the
trial
judge
can
upset
that
only
if
he
finds
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
justice
kennedy
but
surely
the
appellate
court
doesn't
impose
a
standard
on
the
trial
judge
that
the
standard...
that
the
trial
judge
doesn't
have
to
apply
himself.
justice
kennedy
if
you're
a
trial
judge
in
florida,
and
you
receive
a
verdict
from
a
jury
which
recommends
life,
my
understanding
that
the
trial
court's
duty
is
to
sentence
him
to
life
unless
he
can
find
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
but
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
proposition
i
put
to
you,
is
it?
justice
kennedy
but
he
cannot
make
that
determination
unless
he
finds
that
the
jury
has
committed...
has
departed
very
substantially
from
the
evidence.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
really,
with
all
respect,
that
you're
quibbling
with
us
in
your
answer
to
justice
souter
when
he
was
asking
you
about
this.
you
said,
oh,
well
that's
for
the
appellate
court
to
do.
well,
all
the
appellate
court
does
is
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
properly
applied
standards
under
florida
law.
and
that
standard
is
that
the
verdict
cannot
be
set
aside,
the
life
recommendation,
unless
there
is
this
very,
very
high
standard
that
the
trial
court
finds.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
kennedy
i
understand
that.
they
give
simply
a
general
verdict,
so
he
must
assess
all
of
the
evidence.
justice
kennedy
the
standard
is
the
one
that
i
have
described.
justice
kennedy
does
that
frequently
happen?
justice
kennedy
certainly
our
clemons
case
is
not
consistent
with
any
submission
that
a
court
is
deemed
to
perform
its
duty
to
reweigh
the
evidence,
is
it?
justice
kennedy
but
isn't...
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
you're
arguing
to
us
here.
justice
kennedy
that
that's
quite
inconsistent
with
clemons.
justice
kennedy
either
one.
justice
kennedy
that
is
true.
justice
kennedy
clemons
said
that
either
one
would
do.
justice
kennedy
but
that
one
had
to
be
performed,
and
there
was
no
presumption
that
the
state
performed
it
if
it
wasn't
there
on
the
record.
