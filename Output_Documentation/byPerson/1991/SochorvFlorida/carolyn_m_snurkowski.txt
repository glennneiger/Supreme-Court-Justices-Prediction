ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
from
the
onset
i
would
like
to
clarify
a
point,
if
in
fact
any
confusion
exists,
with
regard
to
something
that
was
provided
in
the
state's
brief.
and
that
is
that
the
tedder
standard
is
not
applied
when
a
death
recommendation
is
made
by
the
trial
court.
so
i
want
to
be
put
on
notice
with
regard
to
that,
that
in
fact
the
florida
supreme
court
in
applying
its
tedder
standard,
which
is
the
mechanism
by
which
the
florida
supreme
court
reviews
the
jury's
recommendation,
does
not
apply
when
the
jury
recommends
death.
it
only
applies
when
there's
a
life
recommendation.
which
gets
me
to
the
point
of
some
of
the
questions
today
with
regard
to
what
is
the
role
of
the
jury
in
florida.
from
the
inception,
after
furman,
the
role
of
the
jury
in
florida
has
been
to
provide
the
conscience
of
the
community,
to
provide
the
conscience
of
the
community,
some
expression,
some
ability
to
come
forward
and
express
what
their
views
are.
and
in
that
sense,
the
legislature,
in
creating
a
mechanism
under
the
statute
that
allows
for
the
jury
to
hear
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
it
provides
them
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
in
fact
life
or
mercy...
life
and
mercy,
for
that
matter...
will
be
given.
if
no
mercy
is
given,
we
can
be
confident
that
that
results,
because
they
do
not
make
findings
of
fact.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
makes
findings
of
fact,
nor
is
their
recommendation
binding,
contrary
to
what
was
said
today.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
recommendation
is
given
the
same
recommendation
as
a
life
recommendation.
and
that
is
that
when
the
appellate
court
reviews
it,
because...
one
other
point
before
i
finish
that...
is
that
in
the
statute,
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
when
the
trial
court
finds
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
and
reduces
it
to
writing,
the
very
first
words
directed
to
him
is
notwithstanding
the
jury's
recommendation.
the
jury's
recommendation
is--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--he
is
not
to
give
it
any
weight
with
regard
to
his
findings
with
regard
to
the
proper
and
appropriate
sentence
based
on
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
that
are
being
presented
to
him
at
the
sentencing
proceeding.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
because
the
weight
that's
being
given
the
recommended
sentence
is
an
appellate
weight.
it's
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
ascertain
whether
in
fact
the
conscious
of
the
community
has
spoken
in
such
a
way.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
it's
not--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--under
the...
under
the
appellate
way,
which
is
the
tedder
standard,
which
is
that
the
recommendation
of
life
would
be
given
great
weight.
and
then
we
have
a
standard
that
articulates
that
we
do
not
have
arbitrary
and
unbridled
imposition
of
a
sentence
based
on
some...
the
conscience
of
the
community,
which
is
not...
it's
not
narrowed.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
death
gets
great
weight
also.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
because
in
fact,
the
great
weight
that
is
given
the
death
recommendation
equates
to
no
mercy.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
is
then
faced
with
the
idea
that
the
conscience
of
the
community
has
expressed
its
view
that
when
death
has
been
recommended
by
a
jury,
no
mercy
is
to
be
given.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
an
appellate
review
of
that.
the
trial
court
does
not
make
that
determination.
he
has
to
explain
in
his
order,
his
written
order,
the
basis
for
that.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
think
his
obligation
is
to
sentence
and
make
a
determination
if
there
is
aggravating
factors
that
even
qualify
individual
a
for
death:
and
second
of
all,
determine
if
the
aggravating
outweighs
the
mitigation;
and
then
third,
he
makes
a
statement
with
regard
to
why
he
believes
no
rational
juror
would
have...
would
differ
from
this
result.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
your
honor.
he
does
make...
he
makes
a
determination,
but
that
is
not
his
role--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that's
correct.
but
to
clarify,
the
point
is
that
the
jury
is
not
making
any
findings
that
he
can
look
to
to
make
an
assessment
as
to
whether
their
recommendation
is
logical
or
unbridled.
all
they--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--absolutely.
and
in
that--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor,
but
that
is
applied
in
every
case,
whether
it's
death
or
life,
as
far
as
the
trial
court
is
concerned.
he
has
to
make
that
assessment.
and
in
fact,
in
florida,
it
is
not
unheard
of
that
a
jury
will
come
back
with
a
death
recommendation,
and
in
fact,
the
trial
court
will
impose
life.
and
in
fact,
the
sentence
then
is
life.
so
he's
making--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--it's
not
that
frequent,
but
it
does
happen,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
it
does
happen.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
pardon
me?
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
certainly.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
there
have...
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
not...
it's
not
the...
i
would
not...
i
couldn't
give
a
percentage
to
it,
but
it
is
not
unrare
that
it
happens.
yes,
your
honor.
that
does
frequently
happen.
and
it
also
points
to
another
aspect
of
this
with
regard
to
what
the
jury's
recommendation,
how
important
that
is.
for
example,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
found
that
when
the
trial
court
has
not
properly
submitted
written
findings,
that
life
is
the
appropriate
sentence,
no
matter
what
the
jury's
recommendation
might
be.
now
that's
irrespective
of
how
rational
or
how
irrational.
they
may
have
reasoned
through
the
same
evidence.
this
in
not
different
evidence;
this
is
not
at
a
different
occasion.
this
is
the
same
evidence,
the
same
presentation
of
evidence.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
the
florida
supreme
court's
appellate
review
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
it's
to
determine
that
the
statute
has
been
applied
appropriately.
and
so,
in
so
doing
that,
it
makes
a
determination
by
reviewing
the
whole
record
to
ascertain
whether
in
fact
the
aggravation
has
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
in
fact,
if
the
mitigation
has
been
considered
and
weighed.
because
now
we
have
a
decisional
law
out
of
florida
that
says,
and
comes
out
which...
which
is
a
result
of
hitchcock
also,
that
they
must
not
only
consider,
but
it
has
to
be
weighed,
given
some
weight.
and
so
the
florida
supreme
court
will
reweigh
that
as
part
of
their
appellate
function
to
ensure
that
in
fact
the
death
penalty
has
appropriately
been
applied.
and
in
fact,
in
sochor's
case,
the
court
did
that.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
absolutely.
they
go
through
each
of
the
aggravating
factors.
they
determine--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that's
correct,
but
they
also
go
through
the
mitigation
and...
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
and
tell...
and
explain
why
it
has
been
negated
by
other
aspects
of
the
record
with
regard...
for
example,
of
the
mental
health.
there
were
three
mental
doctor...
mental
health
experts
who
examined
mr.
sochor.
and
in
fact,
two
of
them
were
presented
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial.
their
testimony
reflected
that
at
the
most
he
had
a
personality
disorder,
and
in
fact,
one
of
his
doctors
indicated
that
his
mmpi
was
fake-bad,
meaning
that
he
was
not...
he
was
trying
to
fool
the
doctor.
the
third
doctor,
which
was
the
state's
doctor,
came
up
with
the
same
result.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
think
it
was...
it
was
refuted,
that
mitigation--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
there
are...
there
was
evidence,
for
example,
the
very
thing
that
you
point
to,
that
he,
for
a
period
of
time,
helped
his
father
when
his
father
was
laid
off.
and
that
during
that
time,
he
would
turn
over
his
paycheck.
that
very
well
in
some
circumstance
may
be
very
compelling
mitigation,
but
it
may
be
a
piece
of
evidence
that
in
a
given
case
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
mitigation.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
don't
know.
i
cannot--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes.
well,
there
is...
no.
i
think
what
they
were
saying
or
suggesting
that
there
is
some
level
of
a
determination
of
the
trial
court...
he's
the
trier
of
fact,
he
as
the
sentencer...
has
to
make
those
determinations.
and
unless
there
is
some
reason
why
he
has
not
done
his
job
and
has
not
found
or
done--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--absolutely,
because
that
would
be
a
part
of
the
harmless
error
analysis
if...
given
everything
as
they...
as
it
stands,
absent
that
aggravating
factor,
would
death
be
the
same
result?
is
that
the
appropriate
penalty
for
this
case?
and
that's
exactly
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
in
this
case.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
at
the
very...
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
it's
on
page
381
and
382
of
the
appendix,
joint
appendix.
it
says:
even
after
removing
the
aggravating
factor
of
cold,
calculating,
and
premeditated,
there
still
remains
three
aggravating
factors
to
be
weighed
against
no
mitigating
circumstances.
striking
one
aggravating
factor
when
there
is
no
mitigating
circumstances
does
not
necessarily
require
resentencing.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
absolutely.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
but
when
they're
talking
about
does
it
necessarily
mean
it
has
to
be
rescinded,
that
is
the
point
in
fact,
that
in
fact
they
are
looking
at
it.
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
automatically
has
to
go
back
down
for
resentencing
proceeding.
that
they
will
undertake
some
analysis
to
ensure
that
in
fact
the
sentence,
as
it
results
from
three
aggravating
factors
and
no
mitigation,
as
is
appropriate.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
absolutely
correct.
and--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
certainly,
if
it...
if
they
had
said
the
magic
words,
harmless
error,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
i
wouldn't
have
to
articulate
that.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
would
submit
that
the
case
authority
cited
right
after
that,
robinson,
holton,
james,
francois,
all
are
cases
that
stand
for
that
very
proposition:
that
a
harmless
error
analysis
can
be
made,
and
when
aggravating
factor
has
been
struck
and
there
is
still
exist...
aggravating
factors,
and
there's
no
mitigation
or
little
mitigation,
that
death
can
be
the
appropriate
sentence.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
begs
the
question
that
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
do
its
responsibility
or
doesn't
carry
out
its
appellate
function.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
that
there
is
no
evidence,
let
alone
strong
evidence,
that
it
doesn't
happen--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
but
i
think
there
is
a
presumption
that
an
appellate
court
will
do
its
practices,
and
in
fact,
under
the
statute--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--to
the
point
that,
if
the
court
is
suggesting
that
there
has
to
be
expansive
articulation,
it's
not
there.
the
point
is
where
there's
a
shorthand
the
court
has
used...
it's
pointed
to
cases
which
stands
for
the
proposition
that
harmless
error
is
done.
it's
done
in
a
circumstance
identical
to
the
instant
case.
it's
routinely
done
as
a
matter
of
course
of
the
appellate
process,
when
after
the
normal
appellate
role
is
done,
if
there
is
an
aggravating
factor
or
there
is
some
mishap
with
regard
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
sentence,
a
harmless
error
analysis
is
done
to
ascertain
whether
in
fact
at
that
point
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
i
don't
know
that
a--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
i
don't
know
if
a
reweighing
is
the
same
as
a
harmless
error
analysis.
i
would--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
florida
supreme
court
has
announced
that
it
does
not
do
a
reweighing
with
regard
to
an
error.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
it
will
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
correct.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
respectively
that,
in
fact,
it
is
on
the
record.
the
fact
that
it
is
not
articulated
to
the
extent
that
we
now
have
to
have
every
word
down
as
to
how
they
went
through,
and
they
said,
well,
yes,
now
we
go
back
through
this
opinion,
and
we
realized
that
hac
is
still
valid.
we
realize
that
this
was
committed
during
the
course
of
a
felony.
there
was
in
fact
a
prior
violent
felony.
and
with
regard
to
the
mitigation,
we
again
find
that
the
doctors'
testimony
would
not
have
changed,
because
nothing
has...
nothing
has
been
skewed
with
regard
to
the
facts
before
the
trier
of
fact,
or
for
that
matter,
the
appellate
court.
they
have
gone
through
this
evidence
to
ensure
that
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate,
the
statute
has
been
applied,
that
the
aggravating
factors
have
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
trier
of
fact
has
assessed
the
mitigation,
and
considered
it...
not
only
considered
it,
but
given
it
some
weight.
and
there
is
no
rational
basis
upon
which
to
conclude
that
the
language
that
is
used
in
this
opinion
reflects
that
they
have
not
undertaken
a
harmless
error
analysis,
because
in
fact
it
does.
and
in
matter
of
fact...
you
know,
this
order
would
be
perfect,
or
the
supreme
court's
opinion
would
be
perfect
if
it
said,
i
give
to
you
the...
at
page
382,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
error
was
harmless...
and
those
are
my
words...
and
in
comparison
with
other
death
cases,
we
find
sochor's
sentence
of
death
proportionate
to
his
crime.
those
are
the
three
words
we're
missing:
the
error
is...
or
four
words:
the
error
is
harmless.
that's
what
you're
asking.
because
if
that
were
there,
if
that
were
present
in
this
opinion,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
we
would
be
having
to
discuss
whether
in
fact
they
have
to
articulate
even
greater
language
with
regard
to
what
in
fact
has
to
be
done.
going
to
the
order
of
the
court,
the
trial
court,
in
fact,
the--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--absolutely.
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
done.
it's
a
case-by-case
analysis.
and
there
are
occasions
when
the
court
is
so
convinced
that
there
is
no
harmless
error
analysis
to
be
done,
it's
remanded
for
a
new
sentencing
proceeding.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
the
state
has
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
sentence
is
appropriate,
that
the
results
would
not
have
changed
what
our
standard
is,
that
taking
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
that
the
state
has
come
forward
and
demonstrated
that
what's
left,
the
results
would
not
change.
it
doesn't
that
the
mitigation
is
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
no.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
because
the...
in
fact,
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
that's
a--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--but
again,
they're
not
making
a
finding.
if
i've
said
something
that
would
be
confusing,
i,
you
know,
apologize.
but
they're
not
making
a
finding
that
the
mitigation
has
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
the
harmless
error
analysis
undertaken
by
the
court
is
is
that
removing
the
tainted
circumstance,
that
left
with
that,
the
state
has
come
forward
and
demonstrated
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt...
which
is
an
assertion
the
state
has
to
argue
on
a
appellate
level...
that
the
results
were
the
same.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
absolutely.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no.
the
jury
has
no
input
with
regard
to
a
harmless
error
analysis.
the
state's
contention
is
because
the
jury
is
a
conscience
of
the
community
and
its
role
is
important
with
regard
to
deciding
whether
mercy
should
be
granted,
at
the
point
in
time
when
a...
let's
go
a
death
recommendation
by
the
jury.
when
that
death
recommendation
goes
to
the
florida
supreme
court
for
consideration,
certainly
no
mercy
has
been
given.
that
concept
of
the
jury's
recommendation
is
no
longer
within
the
factoring
when
the
harmless
error
analysis
has
to
be
done,
because
at...
later
determination
has
been
made
that
the--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--but
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
it
doesn't
reweigh.
they
only
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis.
and
the
reason,
i
suspect,
that
they
do
the
harmless
error
analysis
is
in
those
instances
where
life
is
recommended.
and
so
it
equates
to
some
sort
of
degree
of
mercy,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
has
to
struggle
with
its
tedder
standard
and
determine
whether
in
fact
in
some
circumstances
where
life
is
recommended,
the
trial
court
imposes
a
death
sentence,
overrides
it...
a
judicial
override...
and
the
florida
supreme
court
affirms
the
override.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
i
don't
think
they
get
to
a...
i
don't
think
they
get
to
the
proportionality--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--no,
it
does
not,
but
normally,
you
don't
get
to
proportionality,
because
there's
no
purpose
in
trying
to
compare
this
case
with
another.
in
fact,
if
you're
going
to
reverse
with
either
a
new
sentencing
or
a
reducing--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
submit
that
then
begs
the
question
that
in
fact
not
only
a
harmless
error
analysis
was
done,
but
a
proportionality
analysis
was
done,
which
is
mandated
by
the
court's
own
decision
in
brown
v.
wainwright,
which
is
the
second
prong
of
what
i
was
suggesting
to
you
at
a
previous
occasion...
earlier.
and
that
is,
under
brown
v.
wainwright,
the
courts...
has
two
roles:
to
make...
ensure
the
proportionality
this
case...
the
given
case
is
proportionate
to
all
other
death
cases,
and
then,
again,
go
back
to
the
discussion
that
we've
had
with
regard
to
the
appropriateness
of
it.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
don't
know
if
i
can
answer
the
question
because
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
review
life
sentences.
if
you're
talking
about...
if
you're
talking
about
what
the
jury
may
have
recommended--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--absolutely.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
and
there
could
be
a
basis
upon
which,
in
fact,
they
reverse
xxx
sentencing.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
i
beg
to
differ
because
i
don't
see--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
the
reason
i...
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
i
beg
to
differ
because
i
don't
believe
that...
you're
putting
the
horse
before
the
cart,
it
seems
to
me,
when
you're
saying
that
they're
going
to
do
a
proportionality
review.
proportionality
review--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--absolutely.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
because,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
that
in
fact
they
point
to
cases
that
suggest
that
that's
exactly
what
they
do.
they
have
not
been
that
articulate,
but
in
fact,
that
is
what
they
intended
by
their
opinion.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes?
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
it's
to--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
sentencer,
who
is
the
trial
judge,
would
not
have
come
out
with
the
same
result.
he
would
not
have
reached
the
result
that
death
is
appropriate,
because
skewing
the
aggravation
that
he
found
in
his
order
and
looking
at
the
mitigation,
that
he
would
not
with
confidence
say
that...
because
this
is
not
in
numbers.
we're
not
weighing
how
many
ags
and
how
many
mitigation--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
but
that
is...
that's--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--but
that's
only
after
he
has
made
a
determination
that
in
fact
death
is
a
viable
sentence,
one;
and
second
of
all,
he
in
his
own
mind
has
determined
that
the
aggravation
that
has
been
proven
outweighs
any...
mitigation
that
has
been
presented.
and
then
he
makes
a
determination
as
to
why
no
reasonable
person
would
differ.
but
that
does
not
obviate
his
responsibility
to
come
forward.
we
do
not
say
once
the
jury
makes
a
recommendation
of
life,
he
has
no
further
obligation.
he's
the
only
one
that
explains
whether
the
sentence
is
appropriate
or
not.
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
does.
they
are
not
obligated.
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
that
give
us
any
reasons.
and
in
fact,
it
goes
back
to
what
i
previously
argued
with
regard
to
their
role.
their
role
is
the
conscience
of
the
community.
their
role
is
to
grant
mercy.
the
only
way
they
can
grant
mercy
is
if
they
hear
mitigation.
aggravation
will
never
equate
to
mercy.
and
in
fact,
that's
why
the
appellate
standard
of
tedder
v.
florida
is
so...
our
state...
is
so
important,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
is
the
entity.
this
is
the
means
by
which
we
bring
in,
we
build
into
the
appellate
process
the
consideration
of
the
jury,
the
conscience
of
the
community.
there
is
no
other
way
we
can
articulate
that
because
they
are
not
required,
nor
should
they
be
required,
to
give
reasons.
the
only
person
who
has
to
give
reasons
is
the
trial
judge.
he
has
to
make
those
findings.
now,
true,
as
i
have
stated
before,
that
in
fact,
under
the
appellate
function,
the
appellate
court
in
reviewing
the
appropriateness
of
that
expression
of
mercy,
whether
no
mercy
or
not,
must
give
deference
to
that
recommendation.
but
as
i
started
out
my
argument,
tedder
is
not
a
standard
used
by
the
appellate
court
in
determining
the
appropriateness
of
the
jury's
recommendation
of
death.
the
state
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
florida
supreme
court.
thank
you.
