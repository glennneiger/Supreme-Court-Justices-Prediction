mr.
gary
caldwell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
florida's
death
penalty
statute,
as
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
in
1972--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--i
apologize,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gary
caldwell
i
have
a
soft
voice,
i'm
afraid.
am
i
audible
now?
mr.
gary
caldwell
okay,
good.
in
1972,
in
state
v.
dixon,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
florida's
death
penalty
statute
is
reserved
for
the
most
aggravated
and
least
mitigated
of
the
most
serious
crimes.
it
has
held
steadfastly
to
that
position
ever
since.
the
florida
death
penalty
statute
attains
this
goal
by
a
process
of
weighing
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
the
primary
actor
in
this
weighing
process
is
the
jury.
the
jury
has
been
the
main
actor
in
florida
sentencing
since
the
very
earliest
days
of
florida's
statehood.
and
accordingly,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
last
year
held-that
there
is
a
state
constitutional
double
jeopardy
right
to
a
reasonable
jury
verdict.
that
is,
if
there
has
been
a
reasonably
arrived
at
life
verdict,
then
the
defendant
may
not
be
sentenced
to
death.
accordingly,
it
is
our
position
that
florida
is
more
like
a
oklahoma
and
mississippi,
that
is,
it
is
more
like
a
jury-sentencing
state
than
it
is
like
a
judge-sentencing
state,
such
as
arizona.
this
distinction
is
important--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--justice
o'connor,
it
has
said
repeatedly
that
ultimately
florida
is
a
judge-sentencing
court.
that
is
correct.
nevertheless,
this
court
has
also
recognized
in
proffitt
and
in
other
cases
the
primacy
in
florida...
jury...
sentencing
of
the
penalty
verdict.
and
in
hitchcock,
the
court
held
that
it's
necessary
that
the
jury
as
well
as
the
judge
not
be
restrained
in
the
consideration
of
mitigation.
for
instance,
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
florida
system
is
a
tripartite
system.
and
it
is
clear
from
florida
law,
and
from
this
court's
recognition
of
the
primacy
of
tedder
v.
state,
that
under
florida
law,
the
jury
considers...
conducts
the
weighing
in
the
first
instance.
the
court
recognized
that
in
proffitt
when
it
discussed
tedder
and
the
importance
of
the
jury
role
in
sentencing,
and
when
it
discussed
the
heinous
in
the
circumstance.
in
proffitt,
the
court
held
that
the
heinous
in
the
circumstance
was
constitutional
as
construed
in
that
decision,
and
that
that
provided
adequate
guidance,
both
for
the
jury
and
for
the
sentencing
judge.
where...
again,
where
there's
been
a
life
verdict
which
has
been
reasonable
arrived
at
after
the
weighing
of
the
sentencing
circumstances,
that
is
dispositive
of
the
sentencing
decision
in
florida.
accordingly,
it's...
the
role
of
the
jury
cannot
be
sentence...
cannot
be
ignored.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
where
there
is
a
constitutional
defect
in
the
jury
proceeding,
then
the
entire
sentencing
proceeding
is
unconstitutional.
accordingly
where,
as
here,
there's
been
an
error
in
the
trial
court
jury
sentencing
phase
of
the
case
that
makes
the
entire
sentencing
proceeding
unconstitutionally
defective.
and
that
happened
in
this
case.
first
with
respect
to
the
cold,
calculated,
and
premeditation
circumstance,
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
evidence
did
not
support
that
circumstance,
and
that
the
trial
court
had
improperly
entered
it
into
its
weighing
process.
accordingly,
mr.
sochor
did
not
get
a
constitutionally
required
correct
weighing
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
no
actor
in
the
state's
system
properly
weighed
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
so
that
under
parker
v.
dugger,
an
error
occurred.
the
only
way
of
correcting
that
error
would
have
been
through
a
reweighing
of
the
sentencing
circumstances.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
has
long,
long
held
that
it
does
not
reweigh
circumstances.
this
court
held
in
goode
back
in
the
seventies,
that--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
they
do.
they
reweigh
the
mitigating
evidence
sometimes.
sometimes
they
don't.
mr.
gary
caldwell
well,
justice
white,
it's
hard
to
tell
really
what
the
florida
supreme
court
does.
you
can
sort
of
pick
out
a
case
that
says
almost
anything.
in
parker--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--the
judge
said
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--the
short
answer
to
your
question
has
to
be
qualified,
i'm
afraid.
the
sentencing
judge
said
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
he
did
discuss
the
mitigating
evidence
in
a
sentencing
order.
we
don't
know
what
mitigation
the
jury
may
have
found.
presumably
it
found
some
mitigation
because
there
was
substantial
mitigation
before
the
sentencing
jury.
accordingly,
the
jury
certainly,
because
it
was
presented
with
an
improper
aggravating
circumstance,
and
had
lots
of
mitigating
circumstances
before
it...
the
jury
did
have
mitigating
circumstances
to
weigh
against
the
aggravation,
and
therefore,
the
jury
part
of
the
weighing
process
was
improper.
mr.
gary
caldwell
justice
souter,
that
is
correct.
the
jury
does
not
make
specific
findings
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
gary
caldwell
no
specific
findings,
yes,
sir.
however,
there
were
mitigating
circumstances
presented
to
the
jury
pertaining
to
mr.
sochor's
mental
state
at
the
time
of
the
event.
mr.
gary
caldwell
in
part,
yes,
sir.
perhaps
you
and
i
are
talking
about
apples
and
oranges.
mr.
gary
caldwell
justice
souter,
i'm
afraid
that...
i
hate
to
say
it's
not
fair.
the
florida
statute
is
extremely
vague
about
what
the
jury
does.
the
jury
is
charged
with
weighing
mitigating
and
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
gary
caldwell
the
statute
has
a
list
of
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
sir.
that's--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--well,
sir,
it
makes...
yes,
because
it
makes
no
find...
specific
findings
of
fact
as
to
aggravating
circumstances
or
mitigating
circumstances.
it's
a
general
verdict.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
sir,
it's
a
general
verdict.
mr.
gary
caldwell
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct.
it
is
an
advisory
verdict.
however,
it
is
qualified
in
this
way:
that
if
it
is
reasonable
and
it's
a
life
verdict,
the
judge
must
find
it.
and
the
judge's
findings
as
to
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
disregarded
on
appeal.
mr.
gary
caldwell
no,
sir.
it
was
a
verdict
for
death.
however,
again
under
florida
law,
the
judge
is
ordinarily
expected
to
follow
the
penalty
verdict.
one
way
of
looking
at
what
the
judge
does
in
the
sentencing
order
is
the
judge's
order
rationalizes
the
verdict.
mr.
gary
caldwell
the
florida
process
is
that
the
jury
in
the
first
instance
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
it
should
be
a
death
sentence
or
a
life
sentence.
and
it
bases
that
on
the
weighing
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
although
it
is
a
general
verdict,
the
jury
is
assumed
to
weigh
these
things
out,
count
them
up,
figure
out
what
sort
of
weight
to
give
them.
and
the
judge
is...
where
there's
a
life
verdict,
is
almost
completely
bound
to
follow
it.
and
when
there
is
a
death
verdict,
it's
almost
that
close.
that
is,
what
the
judge
does
in
the
sentencing
order
is
basically
rationalize
what
the
jury
has
done.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
justice.
mr.
gary
caldwell
he
found...
he
went
through
the
so-called
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
and
found
that
none
of
them
applied.
as
to
the
so-called
catchall
none
statutory
mitigating
circumstance,
he
wrote
what
the
evidence
was,
or
some
of
the
evidence.
he
didn't
go
through
all
of
it.
he
said
based
on
that
it
did
not
constitute
a
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstance.
and
then
he
said
the
court
does
not
find
sufficient...
the
court
does
not
find
mitigating
circumstances
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
he
did
say
that
he
weighed
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
it
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
mr.
gary
caldwell
well,
he
said
that
that
evidence
did
not
constitute
nonstatutory.
there
was
other
nonstatutory
mitigation
before
the
court,
specifically,
the--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
justice
scalia.
he
said
after
considering
their
testimony.
there
was
other
evidence
of
nonstatutory
mitigating
character,
which
was
the
trial
evidence.
mr.
gary
caldwell
i'm
saying
he
was
ambiguous.
mr.
gary
caldwell
it's
the
sentencing
order,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
joint
appendix.
it's--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--well,
unfortunately,
there
is
a
typographical
error
in
my
brief
on
that.
page
353
has
the
exact
quotation.
mr.
gary
caldwell
i
apologize
for
the
typographical
error.
it's
the
end
summary
in
the
middle
of
page
353
of
the
joint
appendix.
well,
also,
the
eighth...
paragraph
number
8
preceding
that.
mr.
gary
caldwell
well,
he
says
that
he
is
weighing
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
so
there
is
some
weighing
going
on
there.
but
let
me
emphasize--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--all
right.
the
important
point--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--yes,
sir?
mr.
gary
caldwell
paragraph
8?
mr.
gary
caldwell
he
didn't
consider
the
other
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
the...
i
think
that's...
at
least
that
much
is
clear.
the
important
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
and
that
i
started
off
with
was
that,
nevertheless,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
treats
as
naught,
a
finding
of
no
mitigating
circumstances,
where
there's
a
life
verdict.
where
there's
a
life
verdict,
the
court
goes...
just
considers
that
an
improper
finding.
it's...
it
is,
in
effect,
a
provisional
finding
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
are
saying,
however,
that
in
order
to
conduct
a
harmless
error
analysis,
there
has
to
be
a
consideration
of
what
the
jury
verdict
might
have
been.
because
if
there
is
a
life
verdict,
then
this
finding
of
the
trial
judge
just
counts
as
nothing.
it
has
no
value
under
the
florida
system.
once
there
is
a
life
verdict,
then
it's
presumed
that
the
jury
found
all
of
the
statutory
and
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
so
that
when
there
has
been
an
error
which
could
have
affected
the
jury
verdict,
then
we're
in
an
entirely
different
position.
and
that's
what
our
argument
is:
that
under
florida,
the
jury's
verdict
is
so
important
that
it...
if
the
error
could
have
affected
that,
and
that
there
could
reasonable
have
been
a
life
verdict,
then
it
is
as
though
all
of
those
mitigating
circumstances
were
found.
and
that's...
that
is
something
that
is
as
clear
as
anything
from
florida
law.
it's
been
part
of
florida
law
since
well
before
proffitt.
the
court
recognized
that
in
proffitt
that
under
the
so-called
tedder
doctrine,
that
the
jury
is
the
primary
decision
maker,
and
that
where
there
has
been
this
reasonably
arrived
at
life
verdict,
these
sorts
of
findings
made
by
the
judge
just
don't
count
for
anything.
and
we
set
out
in
somewhat
excruciating
detail
in
our
brief
all
of
the
cases
which
say
that
again
and
again.
the
primacy
of
the
jury
plays
into
both
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
i'd
like
to
talk
briefly
about
the
second
issue
as
to
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance,
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
many
times
since
proffitt.
in
1984,
the
florida
supreme
court
just
simply
abandoned
the
proffitt
definition
of
the
circumstance.
proffitt
has
held
that
the
circumstance
was
constitutional
where
it
was
limited
to
the
conscienceless
or
pitiless
crime,
which
is
unnecessarily
torturous.
in
pope
v.
state,
the
florida
supreme
court
wrote
at
some
length
its
disapproval
of
the
conscienceless
or
pitiless
standard.
it
held
that
the
conscienceless
or
pitiless
standard
went
to
the
mindset
of
the
defendant,
that
they
didn't
like
that
because,
in
that
case,
it
had
led
to
application
of
the
circumstance
because
the
defendant
had
pled
not
guilty
and
the
judge
had
concluded
that
meant
the
defendant
had
no
remorse,
and
therefore,
the
crime
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel.
but
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
not
stop
there.
the
supreme
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
disapproved
of
the
conscienceless
or
pitiless
limitation,
that
some
years
previously
it
had
written
it
out
of
the
jury
instructions,
and
that
now
it
was
specifically
disapproving
of
it,
and
that
the
defendant's
mindset,
quote,
unquote,
was
no
longer
at
issue
in
any
case.
accordingly,
the
supreme
court
simply
kicked
out
the
proffitt
definition,
putting
florida
into
the
same
position
as
oklahoma
in
the
maynard
case.
because
florida
has
not
followed
proffitt,
the
heinousness
circumstance
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
two
arguments
pertaining
to
that.
one
is
the
maynard
argument,
which
is
that
the
court
applies
a
circumstance
to
either
the
intent
of
the
defendant,
or
it
can
hold
that
the
intent
is
irrelevant.
it
can
apply
to
the
manner
of
the
killing,
or
it
can
hold
that
the
manner
is
completely
irrelevant.
or
it
can
apply
to
the
effect
on
the
victim,
or
it
can
hold
that
the
effect
to
the
victim
is
completely
irrelevant.
that
was
exactly
the
vice
in
the
oklahoma
statute,
which
the
court
denounced
in
maynard.
and
that
is
the
condition
of
the
circumstance
now
in
florida.
the
second
argument
is
that--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--to
the
jury
instruction.
mr.
gary
caldwell
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gary
caldwell
no,
sir.
and
before
i
discuss
that
more
fully,
let
me
point
out
that
our
principal
emphasis
of
our
argument
is
that
the
circumstance
itself
is
unconstitutional.
the
cause
in
adopting
that
jury
instruction,
the
florida
supreme
court
authoritatively
construed
the
circumstance
as
no
longer
containing
the
proffitt
definition.
they
said
in
pope
the
defendant's
mindset
is
never
at
issue.
they
said
that
that's
completely
irrelevant.
we've
gotten
rid
of
that
proffitt
definition.
we
don't
like
it.
and
that's
what
resulted
in
our
having
this
jury
instruction.
now,
more
directly
to
answer
your
question,
in
the
first
instance,
we
did
move
prior
to
trial
and
argue
that
the
circumstance
was
unconstitutionally
vague,
which
it
is
under
pope.
pope,
when
they
approved
that
jury
instruction,
they
said
this
is
the
definitive
construction
of
the
statute.
after
that,
we
really
didn't
have
any
objection
to
the
jury
instruction,
because
according
to
pope,
the
jury
instruction
was
a
proper
instruction
under
florida
law.
it
stated
what
the
circumstance
was.
we
had
argued
that
the
circumstance
is
unconstitutional.
beyond
that,
we
really
had
no
more
argument
to
make
to
the
trial
judge
because
the
trial
judge
had
said
this
is
a
correct
formulation
of
the
statute.
additionally,
florida's
law
on--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--we
did
make
the
unconstitutional
argument
in
the
trial
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
caldwell
prior
to
trial
we
made
that
argument.
mr.
gary
caldwell
yes,
sir.
and
we
raised
the
constitutionality
under
pope
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
it
addressed
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
and
held
it's
fine,
as
they've
always
held.
mr.
gary
caldwell
they
frequently
invoke
that
as
a
procedural
bar,
justice
kennedy,
but
not
always.
we
have
set
out--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--it
was...
there
was
no
specific...
i'm
sorry.
am
i
making
myself
unclear?
there
was
no
objection
to
the
jury
instruction
at
bar.
no,
sir.
mr.
gary
caldwell
it
can
be,
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
caldwell
no,
sir.
mr.
gary
caldwell
because
this
court
has
held
that
where
the
court
does
not
apply
the
procedural
bar
consistently
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
it
is
not
a
bar
to
this
court's
review.
we
laid
out
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
of
this
'87
trial
in
our
brief,
which
was
that
the
court
held...
and
the
court
held
in
this
case,
and
has
held
since...
the
jury
instruction
issues
may
be
addressed
on
appeal
for
the
first
time
without
an
objection
in
the
trial
court
where
what
is
termed
fundamental
error
has
occurred.
and
in
this--
mr.
gary
caldwell
--it's
called
fundamental
error
in
florida.
it
is
somewhat...
it
is
formulated
in
the
opinion
set
out
in
the
appendix
here
to
the
supreme
court
in
our
case
as...
in
various
ways
the...
including
that
it
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
where
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
it
is
reviewed
on
appeal,
even
without
an
objection.
mr.
gary
caldwell
well,
i
submit
that
under
maynard
there
is
because
the
state
has
been
relieved
of
its
burden
of
proving
the
elements
of
the
circumstance,
because
the
instruction
given
is
constitutionally
defective.
mr.
gary
caldwell
oh,
no,
justice
scalia.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
where,
as
here,
there
is
a
constitutionally
defective
jury
instruction,
there
has
been,
in
essence,
a
denial
of
due
process,
which
is
what
this
fundamental
error
doctrine
addresses.
further...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gary
caldwell
no,
the
florida...
florida
uses
fundamental
error
in
a
different
way
than
the
federal
courts
do.
florida
definition
of
fundamental
error
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
where
the
jury
instruction
denies
due
process...
i
assume
they
mean
like
a
burden-shifting
instruction...
then
it
will
be
addressed
on
appeal.
i'm
into
my
last
time
here.
i'd
like
to
save...
reserve
my
time.
mr.
gary
caldwell
thank
you,
sir.
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter,
you
were
asking
about
the
difference
between
proportionality
analysis
and
a
harmless
error
analysis.
at
footnote
14
of
our
initial
brief,
we
cite
the
case
of
lucas
v.
state,
where
the
supreme
court
of
florida
makes
it
clear
they're
different
analyses.
in
lucas,
the
court
held
that
the
death
penalty
was
proportionate
and
said
we
cannot
say,
however,
that
the
court
properly
found
the
death
sentence
appropriate.
and
they
reversed.
the
only
other
matter
i
want
to
address
was
the
state
has
said
that
the...
in
effect
that
the
jury
does
not
weigh
circumstances.
it
makes
a
decision
as
to
mercy
or
not.
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
allow
a
jury
instruction
on
mercy.
it
does...
the
jury
is
instructed
to
weigh
circumstances.
i'm
just
a
little
bit
surprised
about
that.
one
other
thing.
justice
scalia,
before
i
was
responding
to
your
question
about
fundamental
errors.
is
there
any
further
question
about
that?
okay.
mr.
gary
caldwell
okay.
i
apologize.
thank
you.
