justice
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
ambiguous
at
all.
he
is
much
more
specific
than
that.
he
said,
however,
after
considering
the
testimony,
their
testimony...
he's
talking
about
specific
testimony...
this
court
finds
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
he
found
both
no
statutory
mitigating
and
specifically
found
no
nonstatutory
mitigating.
that's
what
he
said.
justice
scalia
no.
he
said,
after...
however,
after
considering
their
testimony,
this
court
finds
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
scalia
oh,
you
think
he
meant
that...
what?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
ambiguous
at
all.
he
clearly
found
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
on
what
page
in
the
record
will
we
find
this
colloquy
that
you're
discussing?
justice
scalia
it's
on
page
15
of
your
brief.
justice
scalia
mr.
caldwell,
before
you
go
on--
justice
scalia
--i'm
concerned
about
what
is
just
above
what
you've
read.
justice
scalia
paragraph
8
on
page
353,
which
begins,
stating
the
subject:
any
other
aspect
of
the
defendant's
character
or
record
and
any
other
circumstances
of
the
offense.
there
were
several
members
of
the
defendant's
family
who
tearfully
and
grievously
testified.
however,
after
considering
their
testimony,
this
court
finds
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
and
the
first
sentence
of
8
says,
any
other
aspect
of
the
defendant's
character
or
record.
i
think
that's
absolutely
clear
to
me
that
there
are
just
no
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
found
by
the
district
court.
justice
scalia
--yes,
on
cruel
and...
the
heinous
circumstance
instruction,
right?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
you
are
not
procedurally
barred.
as
i
read
the
state
court's
opinion,
it
did
rely
upon
a
procedural
bar.
although
it
went
on
to
discuss
the
merits,
that
was
an
alternate
ground.
wouldn't
that
be
enough
to
say
that
you're
procedurally
barred?
justice
scalia
well,
then
you
should
raise
your
unconstitutional
objection
at
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
you
should
either
do
one
or
the
other.
justice
scalia
in
connection
with
the
instruction?
justice
scalia
prior
to
trial.
justice
scalia
well,
why
doesn't
it
make
those
cases
distinguishable?
i
mean,
is
it
clear
to
you
that
there
is...
well,
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
say
yes.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
there
is
fundamental
error
here...
if
there
is.
justice
scalia
then
any
error
is
fundamental
error.
justice
scalia
you
see...
you
have
to
tell
me
why
you
think
this
is
a
fundamental
error.
is
anything
a
fundamental
error
that
is
not
a
harmless
error?
are
those
two
categories
of
error?
harmless
and
fundamental?
justice
scalia
before
you
go
on,
you
do
acknowledge
that
the
harmless
error
analysis
has
to
be
done.
justice
scalia
but
you
acknowledge
that
if
one
of
the
aggravating
factors
was
inappropriate,
the
court
itself
would
have
had
to
determine
that,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
there
were
no
mitigating
factors
that
the
jury
could
have
considered.
is
that
what
the
harmless
error
would
have
been
here?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
if
that's
what
you
mean
by
harmless
error
then,
then
maybe
the
sentence
the
court
used
is
adequate.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
in
comparison
with
this
case,
we
find
sochor's
sentence
of
death
proportionate
to
his
crime.
justice
scalia
the
same
result
would
have
happened.
justice
scalia
the
result
in
the
recommendation
from
the
jury.
justice
scalia
then
i
don't
understand
why
you're
talking
about
harmless
error
analysis.
if
the
jury...
if
the
jury
determination
is
given
no
weight
at
all,
all
you
have
to
do
is
reweigh.
we
all
agree--
justice
scalia
okay.
ms.
snurkowski?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
consider
harmless
error
analysis
to
be.
you
need
some
baseline
as
to
what
was
harmless.
what
do
you
mean
by
harmless
error
analysis?
what
would
it
have
shown
would
have
come
out
the
same?
you
say
it
would
not
have
shown
that
the
jury
recommendation
would
have
come
out
the
same.
that
is
not
what
its
object
is?
justice
scalia
it's
to
show
that
what
would
have
come
out
the
same?
justice
scalia
but
you
acknowledged
earlier
that
he
cannot
impose
a
death
sentence
unless...
if
the
jury
had
recommended
life,
unless
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
recommended
life.
justice
scalia
so
part
of
his
determination,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
jury's
determination.
