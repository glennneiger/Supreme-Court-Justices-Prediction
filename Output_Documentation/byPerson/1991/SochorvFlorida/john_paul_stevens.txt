justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
standard
of
review
in
florida
of
a
trial
judge's
statement
in
the
finding
that
there
are
no
nonmitigating
circumstances,
the
difference
between
mitigating
evidence
and
mitigating
circumstance
that
justice
souter
indicated?
suppose,
as
in
this
case,
a
lot
of
evidence
is
offered
as
to
mental
stability,
alcoholism,
he
supported
the
family
for
a
while,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
in
which
it
clearly
is
mitigating
evidence.
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i've
heard
all
this,
and
i
don't
disbelieve
any
of
it,
but
in
my
judgment,
it
does
not
carry
enough
weight
to
be
called
a
mitigating
circumstance.
does
the
supreme
court
of
florida
review
that
at
all,
or
as
its
opinion
seems
to
suggest,
is
this
entirely
a
matter
for
the
trial
judge
to
just
decide
whether
or
not
this
evidence
is
worthy
of
the
characterization
as
a
mitigating
circumstance?
justice
stevens
did
they
do
that
in...
did
they
do
that
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
no,
they
did
not
in
the
aggravating.
i'm
talking
about
the
nonstatutory
mitigating,
and
as
to
that,
what
they
said,
the
decision
as
to
other
particular
mitigating
circumstance
is
proven
lies
with
the
judge
and
jury.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
understanding
that
they,
the
florida
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
mitigating
evidence
offered
was
untrue?
justice
stevens
i
understand
on
the
mental
condition.
justice
stevens
but
as
things
like
whether
he
supported
the
family
when
his
father
wasn't
working
and
his
alcohol
problem,
that
that
was
untrue?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
my
point.
that's
my
point.
what
did
the
florida
supreme
court
do
with
respect
to
that
bit
of
evidence
here?
justice
stevens
didn't
they
say
that
that's
a
matter
for
the
trial
judge
which
we
don't
review?
justice
stevens
well,
there
was
a
reason
in
this
case,
namely
that
he
relied
on
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
improper.
does
that
give
rise
to
any
duty
to
review
the
rest
of
what
his
determination
was?
justice
stevens
where
did
they
do
that?
where
in
the
appendix?
justice
stevens
doesn't
necessarily.
does
it
require--
justice
stevens
--anybody
to
reweigh
the
aggravating
versus
mitigating?
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
another
question?
would
you
agree
that
there
could
be
cases
in
which,
after
looking
at
the
whole
record,
the
florida
supreme
court
could
conclude
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
disproportionate
to
other
death
penalties
throughout
the
state,
but
that
nevertheless,
prejudicial
error
had
occurred?
justice
stevens
because
the
mere
fact
that
they
conclude
something
is
not
disproportionate
really
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
whether
error
occurred.
justice
stevens
well,
you
get
to
proportionality
in
this
case
because
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
responds
to
the
argument
that
it
was
disproportionate.
