justice
souter
do
you
mean...
i
don't
mean
to
put
you
off
your
argument,
but
don't
you
mean
that
the
jury
had
mitigating
evidence
to
weigh?
it
didn't
find
any
circumstances,
isn't
that
right?
justice
souter
okay.
so
what
it
was
weighing
is...
against
the
aggravating
circumstances
what
it
was
weighing
was
evidence.
not
specific
findings,
but
it
was
weighing
evidence,
mitigating
evidence.
justice
souter
but
what
you
mean
is
that
there
was
evidence
which
had
a
mitigating
tendency.
isn't
that
what
you
mean?
justice
souter
well,
what
i'm
talking
about...
when
i'm
using
the
word
circumstance,
i'm
talking
about
specific
findings
which
are
provided
for
by
statute...
the
finding,
for
example
in
this
case,
cold-blooded
or
what
not.
and
when
you
use
circumstance
just
to
mean
any
fact
that
had
a
mitigating
tendency,
it
just
gets
confusing.
and
i
think
what
you
mean,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
is
that
the
jury
had
evidence
of
mitigating
facts,
but
it
did
not
go
through
a
purpose...
a
process
of
finding
that
mitigating
circumstances,
as
a
term
of
art,
existed.
is
that
fair?
justice
souter
yes,
but
the
florida
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
say
there
are
certain
facts
which
we
will
dignify
by
the
term
mitigating
circumstances.
they
are
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
florida
law,
is
there?
justice
souter
it
does?
justice
souter
and
is
the
jury
instructed
to
find
them
in
the
same...
or
fail
to
find
them...
in
the
same
sense
that
it
is
instructed
to
find
or
fail
to
find
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
souter
so
that
in
this
case
the
jury
had
mitigating
evidence,
but
it
in
fact
made
no
findings
that
mitigating
circumstances
had
actually
been
proven.
justice
souter
okay.
oh.
the
jury
then
is
charged
as
to
its
duty
to
deal
with
aggravating
circumstances
and
with
mitigating
evidence,
but
then
it
simply
returns
a
verdict
of
death
or
not
death.
justice
souter
and
the
judge
does
make
specific
findings,
right?
justice
souter
in
other
words,
he
doesn't
come
in
with
a
general
verdict,
as
it
were.
he
makes
specific
findings
of
aggravating
circumstances,
or
mitigating.
justice
souter
in
this
case
he
found
four
aggravators
and
he
found
no
mitigators.
justice
souter
in
a
case
in
which
the
jury
does
not...
i'm
sorry,
a
case
in
which
the
jury
does
recommend
death,
what
is
the
articulation
under
florida
law
of
the
weight
to
be
given
to
that
recommendation?
justice
souter
no,
but
what
weight
does
he
have
to
give
the
jury's
recommendation?
justice
souter
well,
if
he
doesn't
give
it
any
weight
at
all,
why
does
florida
go
through
the
process
of
having
the
jury
make
a
recommendation?
justice
souter
all
right.
now,
how
does
the
appellate
weighing
of
the...
strike
that.
i'm
not
going
to
use
that
term.
justice
souter
how
does
florida
articulate
the
degree
of
weight
to
which
the
appellate
court
should
ascribe?
justice
souter
okay.
life
gets
great
weight.
what
does
death
get?
justice
souter
they
both
do.
justice
souter
ms.
snurkowski,
i
apologize
for
what
i'm
afraid
is
going
to
make
the
confusion
worse,
but
i've
got
to
ask
the
question.
as
i
understand,
you're
referring
to
the
carry-over
paragraph
that
begins
at
381
of
the
appendix.
justice
souter
and
you're
saying
in
effect,
that's
the
point
at
which
the
florida
supreme
court
considered
the
evidence,
mitigating
evidence,
even
though
no
mitigating
factors
were
found
for
purposes
of
harmless
error.
but
isn't
the
florida
supreme
court's
object
at
that
point
to
conduct
a
disproportionality
analysis?
and
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
its
harmless
error
analysis.
justice
souter
okay.
now
where
did
it
go
through
a
harmless
error
analysis
in
response...
going
back
to
justice
steven's
question...
where
did
it
go
through
a
harmless
error
analysis,
which
considered,
let
alone
discussed,
mitigating
evidence?
justice
souter
well,
i
don't
know
we
would
have
or
not,
but
they
didn't
say
the
magic
words,
and
where
can
you
find
a
harmless
error
analysis
that
considers
mitigating
evidence
in
that
opinion?
i
mean,
the
question
invites
the
answer.
i
don't
see
it.
justice
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
that's
an
appropriate
statement
of
law.
it
has
nothing
to
do,
it
seems
to
me,
with
the
question
whether
they
went
through
that
process
in
this
case.
justice
souter
you
mean
unless
the
florida
supreme
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
do
harmless
error
analysis
here,
that
we've
got
to
assume
that
it
did?
justice
souter
how
can
you
go
through
an
analysis
without
analyzing
anything?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
any
discussion
here.
justice
souter
is
it
fair
to
say
that,
in
a
close
case,
either
a
life
or
death
sentence
might
survive
a
proportionality
analysis,
but
that
either
a
life
or
death
sentence
might
be
the
result
of
error
that
was
not
harmless?
justice
souter
oh,
i
see,
so
the
only
proportionality
analysis...
okay,
we'll
just
modify
my
question
then.
let's
say
it's
a
close
case.
the
actual
sentence
is
a
death
sentence,
and
the
court
finds
that
it
is
not
disproportionate
to
other...
to
the...
to
other
death
sentences
under
other
circumstances.
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
even
though
the
death
sentence
survives
the
proportionality
analysis,
it
still
may
be
the
result
of
error
which
could
not
be
called
harmless?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
my
only
point
is
if
you
can't
argue
from
the
fact
that
they
survived...
that
the
sentence
survived
to
proportionality
analysis,
that
they
must
therefore
also
have
conducted
a
harmless
error
analysis.
justice
souter
well,
i
thought
you
just
admitted
something
which
is
inconsistent
with
differing.
justice
souter
well,
they
did
it
in
this
case.
justice
souter
i'm
talking
about
this
horse
and
this
cart.
and
they
did
it
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
infer
from
the
fact
that
they
did
proportionality
in
this
case
that
they
also
must
have
done
harmless
error.
justice
souter
okay.
but
the
point
then
is
we
know
they
did
harmless
error
because
they've
cited
a
harmless
error
case,
not
because
they
did
proportionality
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
this
morning
is
sochor
v.
florida,
no.
91-5843.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
jury
found
petitioner,
dennis
sochor,
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
for
chocking
a
woman
to
death
when
she
resisted
his
attempt
to
rape
her.
after
a
separate
penalty
trial,
the
jury
recommended
that
the
trial
court
imposed
the
death
penalty.
the
trial
court
found
that
four
of
the
aggravating
factors
enumerated
in
florida's
capital
sentencing
statute
applied
to
sochor.
among
them,
that
sochor's
murder
was
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
and
that
sochor
committed
the
murder
in
a
cold,
calculated,
and
premeditated
manner.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
rejected
sochor's
claim
that
vagueness
in
the
description
in
the
heinousness
factor
resulted
in
constitutional
error.
however,
it
sustains
sochor's
claim
that
the
evidence
failed
to
support
the
trial
judge's
finding
of
the
coldness
factor.
nevertheless,
the
court
affirmed
sochor's
sentence.
in
this
court,
sochor
renews
his
claims.
first,
that
the
jury
instructions
on
the
heinousness
factor
were
unconstitutionally
vague.
we
cannot
reach
that
claim
however,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
found
that
sochor's
trial
lawyer
failed
to
object
when
the
judge
instructed
the
jury.
next,
we
reject
on
the
merits
of
sochor's
claim
that
the
heinousness
factor
left
the
trial
judge
without
sufficient
guidance.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
consistently
held
that
finding
of
heinousness
is
proper
when
a
defendant
has
strangled
a
conscious
victim
and
we
must
assume
that
the
trial
judge
was
aware
of
that.
third,
sochor
argues
that
error
occurred
when
the
jury
considered
the
coldness
factor
because
the
evidence
did
not
support
a
finding
of
that
factor.
however,
florida
juries
do
not
reveal
the
specific
aggravating
factors
they
find
and
we
decline
to
presume
that
the
jury
found
the
coldness
factor
applicable
even
though
the
evidence
did
not
support
it.
finally,
sochor
argues
that
although
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
considering
an
aggravating
factor
that
the
evidence
did
not
support,
the
court
failed
to
make
sure
that
the
error
was
harmless.
this
time
we
agree
with
sochor.
the
court's
remarks
on
the
issue
are
ambiguous
at
best
and
thus,
insufficient
to
cure
the
error.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
o'connor
has
filed

concurring
opinion;
