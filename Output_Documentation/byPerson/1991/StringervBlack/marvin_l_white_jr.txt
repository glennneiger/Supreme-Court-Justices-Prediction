mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
gregg
and
in
zant
both,
this
court
stated
that
each
distinct
scheme
for
imposing
the
sentence
of
death
on
a
defendant
must
be
examined
on
an
individual
basis,
and
that's
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
with
the
mississippi
scheme
here.
in
order
to
answer
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
today,
that
is
whether
clemons
or
maynard
are
to
be
retroactively
applied,
we
must
examine
how
the
mississippi
statutory
scheme
works
and
operates
in
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence.
this
is
because
the
scheme
found
in
mississippi
is
almost
unique.
there's
only
one
other
state
that
has
a
statute
like
that,
and
that
is
louisiana.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
ma'am...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
you
said
that,
there
in
lowenfield,
that...
and
i
interpreted
as
saying
yes...
that
in
lowenfield
that
the
constitution...
the
last
sentence
of
the
opinion
says
that
the
narrowing,
constitutional
narrowing
is
done
by
the
finding
of
guilt
of
one
of
the
narrowly
defined
crimes,
and
the
constitution
requires
no
more.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
the...
that
is
not
the
theory.
that
the...
it
does
not
infringe
on
the
constitution
to
have
those
aggravating
circumstances
if
they're
even
vaguely
defined
in
comparison
with
godfrey
even,
or
zant,
i
should
say,
is
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
because
as
in
johnson
v.
thigpen,
as
the
fifth
circuit
found,
and
as
we
have
argued
contrary
to
counsel
opposite,
that
we
have
always
said
we
were
like
florida,
we
have
not.
the
decision
in
johnson
v.
thigpen
would
not
be
there
had
we
argued
otherwise.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct,
under
state
law.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct,
because
it's
not
constitutionally
required.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
if
in
lowenfield...
and
the
mississippi
statute
operates
as
does
the
louisiana
statute...
if
the
narrowing...
that
all
the
constitution
requires
is
that
narrowing
to
limit
the
class
of
people
for
who
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
is
constitutionally
completed
or
established
by
the
finding
of
guilt
of
one
of
the
narrowly
defined
crimes...
and
lowenfield
said
the
constitution
requires
no
more.
if
we
on
the
state
law
basis
go
further
and
require
a
further
narrowing,
we
contend
it
doesn't--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--in
this
case?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no.
well,
i
mean
they
never
reached
that.
they
just
said
it
was...
that
teague
did
not
apply...
i
mean
that
teague
barred
its
application
on
remand.
the
first
time
through,
they
said
that
if
it
isn't
vague
or
invalid
in
this
particular
case,
yes,
that
there
were
other
valid
aggravating
circumstances
that
allowed
this
to
be
affirmed.
and
the
issue,
of
course,
going
back
to
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
johnson
v.
thigpen,
we
say
that
even
if
this
is
to
be
looked
at
this
way,
that
lowenfield...
i
mean
lowenfield
and
johnson
v.
thigpen
both
allow
us
to
rely
on
this
as
a
new
rule,
especially
in
maynard.
i
mean,
and
maynard
coming
from
godfrey,
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
johnson
v.
thigpen
that
this
very
instruction
was
not
even
cognizable
in
habeas.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
to
some
extent.
when
you
say
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
mississippi
take
on
a
constitutional
significance,
then
it
conflicts
with
lowenfield
in
that
respect,
in
that
we
have
to
do...
they
also
have
to
meet
the
same
test
as
the
narrowing
factors
that
the
court
held
required
by
law
in
lowenfield.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
you
didn't
address
it
in
clemons.
it
is
argued
not
as
forcefully
as
it
is
here,
but
it
was
argued
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
mississippi
do
not
have
the
same
constitutional
significance
as
they
do
in
georgia,
florida,
and
oklahoma.
that
as
i
say,
the
argument
is
made
there
in
clemons,
and
it
was
made
before
that
in
johnson
v.
mississippi.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
probably
so,
but
we
weren't
discussing,
i
don't
think,
new
rules
at
that
point,
of
whether
this
was
a
new
ruling.
clemons,
as
the
court
started
off
its
opinion
by
saying,
that
we
are
now
addressing
the
question
that
we
left
open
in
zant.
i
mean
i
think
that
is
almost
a
total
answer
of
the
question
whether
it's
a
new
rule
or
not
there,
because
if
the
court
has
never
spoken
to
this
issue
and
they
speak
to
it,
and
that's
what
the
court
said,
the
opinion
says
in
clemons,
we
now
address
that
question
we
left
open
in
zant.
and
our
court
had
been
relying
on
zant
all
this
time
in
doing
so.
and
now
clemons
comes
down
and
says
that
you
have
to
do
it
another
way,
that
you
have
to
do
a
reweighing
or
a
harmless
error
analysis
now
instead
of
just
what
you
have
been
doing
under
zant...
or
relying
on
zant
in
doing
that.
so
the...
of
course
as
we
said,
the
aggravating
factors
under
the
mississippi
statute
act
as
actually
a
second
filter
that's
not
constitutionally
required,
and
of
course,
reading
lowenfield,
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
way
the
mississippi
statute
operates
is
that
these
aggravating
factors
take
on
a
different
significance
under
the
mississippi
statute...
under
the
louisiana
statute
than
they
do
in
georgia,
florida,
and
oklahoma.
we
define
narrowly
as
does
texas.
we
define
narrowly
as
does
louisiana.
and
this
court
has
said
that
no
more
was
required.
so
if
clemons
stands
for
the
fact
that
yes,
there
is...
these
aggravating
circumstances
in
mississippi
do
have
constitutional
significance,
then
that
is
a
new
rule
because
it
has
not
been
stated
before.
and
as
relying
on
the
ruling
in
johnson
v.
thigpen
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
where
they
said
the
aggravating
circumstances
had
no
constitutional
significance,
were
not
even
cognizable
in
federal
habeas,
and
that
takes
care
of
both
maynard
and
clemons
as
being
new
rules
there,
because
both
of
them
address
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
same
aggravating
circumstance,
for
that
matter.
in
other
words,
the
court
is
actually
for
the
first
time
saying
that
relevant
admissible
truthful
evidence
presented
during...
to
the
jury
during
a
sentence
phase
of
a
capital
trial
was
given
constitutional
significance
because
it
was
denoted
in
aggravating
circumstance.
in
georgia,
the
statute
there...
the
court
has
said
there
that
narrowing
is
performed
by
the
aggravating
circumstance.
and
then
the
jury
can
consider
anything.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
defined.
it's
wide
open.
they
consider
a
whole
myriad
of
aggravating
factors,
but
they're
not
statutorily
listed.
and
they
can
consider
any
evidence
before
them
that's
relevant.
why
does
it
change
because
we
denoted
an
aggravating
factor,
and
basically
limit
that
to
that
respect?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
that
they
took
that
tack
after--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
in
clemons,
it's
the
first
time
they
actually
took
that
tack,
that
said
yes,
it
is.
up
until
that
time,
the
court
said
no.
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
johnson...
jones
v.
state,
montecarlo
jones
v.
state,
the
concurrence
talks
about
johnson
v.
thigpen
and
says
the
federal
courts,
being
neutral
observers,
have
found
no
constitutional
infirmity
or
even
constitutional
necessity
in
our
aggravating
circumstances.
yes,
i
think
on
a
state
law
basis
they
have
looked
to
florida
somewhat
in
the
aggravating
circumstance
area.
but
they
stand
for
different
purposes.
i
mean,
florida's
aggravating
circumstance...
and
our
state
has
given
some
significance
to
these,
you
know,
under
state
law,
this
is
the
way
that
it
has
to
be.
and
we
have...
you
have
to
find
these
things
in
order
to
take
that
second
step
and
weigh
those
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
and
then
the
jury
must
find
whether
or
not
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence
after,
and
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
i
think,
in
this
particular
case,
it
must
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
under
the
statute,
the
mitigating
have
to
outweigh
the
aggravating,
but
that's
no...
just
here
it's
just
turned
around.
but
we're
considering
evidence...
we
don't
have
evidence
coming
to
the
jury
that
they
couldn't
have
before
them
in
any
other...
you
know,
it
was
totally
admissible,
everything
that
was
considered
in
relation
to
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel
aggravating
factor...
photographs,
the
argument,
everything
in
support.
even
had
it
not
been
denoted
an
aggravating
factor,
the
jury
still
could
have
considered
it.
and
mississippi
does
allow
for
the
consideration
of
nonstatutory
aggravating
factors,
they
have
to
find
the
others,
but
the
jury
can
certainly
consider
those.
they
have
said
in
jordan
v.
state,
and
just
most
recently
in
hanson
v.
state,
that
the
jury
certainly
can
consider
nonstatutory
aggravating
circumstances.
they
can't
rest
the
death
penalty
solely
on
that
as
a
finding
there,
but
they
can
certainly
consider
them
in
assessing
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed.
and
that's
the
ones
that
they
have
mentioned,
mainly,
as
future
dangerousness.
so
we
look
to
that.
they
can
consider
these
other
factors
other
than
that,
but
they
do
have
to
find
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance.
and
as
we
contend
under
mississippi
law,
is
contrary
to
godfrey,
a
jury
in
mississippi
could
never
return
a
death
sentence
based
solely
on
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel.
they
have
first
always
found
that
defendant
guilty
of
one
of
the
narrowly
defined
crimes
set
out...
and
there
were
seven
crimes
set
out
in
our
statute
that
carry
or
elevate
the
crime
to
a
capital
murder
offense.
and
then
after
they
have
been
convicted
of
that,
then
the
jury
must
look
at
aggravating
factors.
we
have
never
had
a
jury
come
back
with
a
verdict
even
at
that,
and
have
solely
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
and
cruel
aggravating
factor
as
the
only
aggravating
factor
that
they
considered.
so
even
if
you
had
a,
as
justice
souter
was
talking,
the
second
narrowing
or
a
double
narrowing
statute...
and
we've
called
it
a
double
narrowing
statute.
that's
not
something
that
we
have
not
used
a
term
in
describing
our
statute,
that
is
a
double
narrowing
statute.
even
so,
when
you
look
at
that,
it's
what
makes
that
second
one
the
finding
of
one
aggravating
circumstance,
then
you
get
into
a
zant-type
analysis
then
and
what
is
the
effect
of
the
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
at
that
point.
does
it
then
skew
that
balance
to
the
point,
and
of
course,
looking
at
barclay
and
goode,
and
the
type
of
analysis
this
court
and
the
florida
court
made
in
both
those
cases,
it's
no
different
than
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
been
doing
all
these
years
in
those
cases.
it's
not
what
was
stated
in
clemons.
petitioner
brings
up
parker
v.
dugger;
of
course,
retroactivity
is
not
raised
in
parker
v.
dugger.
it
was
not
addressed
in
the
briefs.
it
was
not
addressed
in
oral
argument.
and
whether
that
was
an
oversight...
whatever
it
was,
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
compelling
or
a
binding
precedent
that
clemons
has
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
the
cases
are
differently
situated
anyway.
because...
basically
because
of
the
way
the
statutes
operate
and
because
of
the
manner
in
which
they
do.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
teague
was
a
direct
appeal
case
and
we
could
not--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--there
was
no
teague
argument
to
make
there.
this,
in
fact,
this
case,
smith
v.
black,
and
hill
v.
black,
all
came
to
the
fifth
circuit
after
clemons,
or
either
were...
had
hardly
been
decided
in
this
court,
sent
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
clemons.
and
our
argument
there
was
that
this
case
in
fact,
this
is
a
new
rule
and
that
it
is,
you
know,
teague
barred
from
retroactive
effect
of
these
opinions,
both
maynard
and
clemons.
the
fifth
circuit's
main
opinion
in
this,
of
course,
is
not
in
this
case.
it
is
in
smith
v.
black
where
judge
king
has
written
a
quite
lengthy
analysis
of
why
these
precedents...
this
precedent
especially,
the
clemons
precedent,
is
not
retroactive.
in
the
particular
case,
bar,
the
fifth
circuit
basically
just
said
we
adopt
and
we
reaffirm
and
reinstate
our
earlier
judgment
based
on
smith
v.
black,
the
same
thing
they
have
done
also
in
a
case
called
hill
v.
black,
which
was
also
sent
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
clemons.
so
we
have
two
other
cases,
at
least
two
other
cases
pending
on
this
same
issue
in
the
fifth
circuit,
before
this
court,
in
fact.
smith
is
already
before
this
court.
but
that
is
where
the
full
opinion
is
delineating
how
the
fifth
circuit
arrived
at
that.
and
i
think
judge
king's
analysis
there
is
very
clear
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
constitutional
limits
had
been
put
on
how
aggravating
factors
ought
to
be
considered
in
mississippi
because
of
the
difference
in
the
statutes.
and
because
we
do
have,
and
this
court's
precedent
allows
for,
difference
in
the
manner
in
which
we
apply
our
statutes
or
the
statutes
that
are
operating,
then
we
can
say...
we
contend
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
individual
statute
and
how
it
operates
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
certain
precedents
would
have
retroactive
effect
on
that
particular
statute.
and
of
course,
we
would
further
contend
that
the...
that
this
is
simply
a
procedurally...
and
it
doesn't
fit
into
the
exceptions
of
teague
either.
first,
it
doesn't
outlaw
any
private
conduct
or
anything
like
that.
it's
not
a
watershed
rule.
both
our
decisions
relating
to
procedurally
flawed
contemplation
or
review
are
relevant
evidence,
and
that's
not
something
that
would
kick
in
the
second
exception
to
teague.
thank
you.
