justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
talking
about
maynard
now
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you're
going
to
get
to
clemons
pretty
soon,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
right.
i
just
thought
you
were
about
to
talk
about
clemons.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
case
it
was
still
necessary
to
find
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
so
the
jury
had
to
find
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
addition
to
the
narrowing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
jury
could
be...
could
satisfy
that
requirement
by
finding
an
aggravating
circumstance
that's
just
plain
outright
vague.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
brother,
i
think--
--but
the
state
law
requires
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
fifth
circuit
find
this
instruction
invalid
for
vagueness?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
wrong
about
that
in
clemons?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
didn't
we,
in
zant,
didn't
it
just
leave
open
the
question
of
the
significance
of
the
invalidity
of
one
of
several
aggravating
circumstances
in
a
balancing
state,
in
a
weighing
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
surely
clemons
was,
in
that
respect
was
a
new
rule
on
the
fifth
circuit,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
a
new
rule
somewhere
and
it--
--it
did
not
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
in
that
case,
since
that
came
from
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
maynard.
that's
the
maynard
argument.
