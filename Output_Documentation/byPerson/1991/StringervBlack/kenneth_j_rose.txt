mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
james
stringer
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
die
in
hinds
county,
mississippi
for
a
killing
during
the
commission
of
an
attempted
robbery.
the
jury
found
three
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
one
of
which
was
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance.
the
jury
then
found
that
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
were
not
outweighed
by
mitigating
circumstances.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
affirmed
mr.
stringer's
conviction
and
sentence
after
a
review
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
the
court
below,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
again
affirmed
mr.
stringer's
sentence,
relying
on
what
it
perceived
to
be
mississippi's
rule
of
automatic
affirmance.
that
is,
where
there's
at
least
one
valid
aggravating
circumstance,
despite
the
fact
that
the
jury
may
have
also
relied
on
an
invalid
or
unconstitutional
aggravating-circumstance,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
would
automatically
affirm
the
sentence
of
death
without
individualized
review.
this
court
vacated
mr.
stringer's
sentence
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
clemons
v.
mississippi.
the
fifth
circuit
again
affirmed
the
sentence,
this
time
relying
upon
the
nonretroactivity
of
clemons
v.
mississippi
and
maynard
v.
cartwright.
clemons
and
maynard
represent
no
new
law.
we
rely
on
two
fundamental
principals
central
to
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
i
could
go
ahead
and
address
that
now.
mississippi
has
always
contended
that
it
is
a
state
like
florida,
that
is,
it
requires
a
finding
of
at
least
one
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
and
then
the
jury
is
required
to
weigh
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
against
all
mitigating
circumstances,
and
the
jury
is
required
to
make
a
unanimous
finding
that
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
are
not
outweighed
by
mitigating
circumstances.
mississippi
has
compared
itself
to
florida
and
has
relied
upon
florida
law
in
several
cases;
coleman
v.
state,
evans
v.
state,
gilliard
v.
state.
the
state
contends
that
mississippi
is
not
like
florida,
because
it
says
that
there
is
a
narrowing
done
in
mississippi
at
the
definition
of
capital
murder.
our
contention
is
even
if
that
is
true,
even
if
mississippi
has
defined
capital
murder
in
a
way
similar
to
texas
where
it
makes
a
subclass
of
persons
that
may
have
committed
murders
eligible
for
the
sentencing
phase,
that
is
not...
that
does
not
solve
the
constitutional
problem,
because
mississippi
then
allows
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
to
be
relied
upon
by
the
sentencer,
and
puts
emphasis
on
those
circumstances.
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
in
mississippi,
you
have...
the
jury
must
make
that
unanimous
finding
that
aggravating
circumstances
are
not
outweighed
by
mitigating
circumstances.
so
the
fact
that
mississippi
has
allowed
a
vague
aggravating
circumstance
to
be
considered
and
relied
upon
by
the
jury
is
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
florida
has
narrowing.
and
i
think
that's
a...
that
may
be
a
misconception
that
mississippi
has
narrowing,
florida
does
not.
and
then
there's
balancing
in
mississippi
and
in
florida.
florida
has
narrowing
by
the
initial
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
mississippi
has
narrowing
either
by
the
definition
of
capital
murder
or
by
the
initial
finding
of
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
but
then
they
both
require
a
weighing.
so
they're
similar
in
the
respect
that
both
have
some
initial
narrowing.
but
then
they
both
require
aggravating
circumstances...
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
to
play
a
central
role.
and
if...
this
court
has
always
held
that
if
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
is
vague,
even
if
it's
at
that
point
where
it's
determining
eligibility
for
the
death
sentence,
where
aggravating
circumstances
are
weighed
with
mitigating
circumstances,
then
there's
constitutional
error.
this
court
held
in
zant
where
there
was
an
initial
narrowing
by
an
aggravating
circumstance,
a
valid
aggravating
circumstance,
that
there
still
needed
to
be
an
individualized
determination
of
the
effect
of
an
unconstitutional
aggravating
circumstance.
and
this
court
accepted
georgia's
representation
that
the
effect
was
inconsequential
in
georgia
because
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
played
no
special
role
under
the
georgia...
played
no
role
under
the
georgia
scheme
beyond
the
initial
narrowing.
so
the
problem
in
mississippi
and
the
problem
in
georgia
that
the
court
discussed
in
zant
that
was
a
cause
of
constitutional
error
in
zant
was
not
that
there
was
no
narrowing
at
all;
the
problem
was
that
there
a
consideration
by
the
jury
of
a
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
that
introduced
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
factor.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
i
would
agree.
i
think...
i
think
that
first
of
all,
godfrey
said
that
you
cannot
consider
vague
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
our
clemons
point
is
that
there
must
be
some
individualized
cure
once
the
sentencer
has
considered
a
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
and
that
has
always
been
the
case.
that
was
the
case
even
in
georgia,
where
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
the
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
played
no
role.
so
our
position
is
that
georgia
required
individualized
review
and
this
court
approved
georgia's
application
of
its
statute
in
part
because
it
did
require
some
individualized
review.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
have
to
show
clemons
is
not
a
new
rule.
and
i
think
we
can.
i
think
if
you
look
at
california
v.
ramos
as
just
an
example,
this
court
said
that
there
had
to
be
some
substantive...
there
are
some
substantive
limitations
on
the
factors
that
the
sentencer
can
consider
in
determining
whether
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment.
and
it
says
what
those
substantive
limitations
are.
it
says
those
limitations
are
consideration
of
vague
factors.
that's
apart
from
any
consideration
of
the
narrowing
rule,
the
initial
narrowing
rule
that
every
statute
must
provide.
in
other
words,
there's
a
procedural
requirement
that
every
death
penalty
statute
must
be,
and
that
is
it
must
circumscribe
the
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
and
then
it
may
allow
the
sentencer
to
consider
a
myriad
of
factors
in
determining
punishment.
but
one
factor
we
know,
and
we've
known
it
since
zant
and
we've
known
it
since
california
v.
ramos,
one
factor
it
may
not
allow
juries
to
consider
are
vague
aggravating
circumstances.
and
the
reason
that
is
so
is
because
it
introduces
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
factor
into
the
sentencing
proceeding.
we
don't
know
what
the
juries
considered
when
they
considered
vague
aggravating
circumstances--
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
--your
honor,
i'm
talking
about
what
was
applied
in
maynard.
it
was
a
rule
that
was
not
even
discussed,
i
might
add.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
the...
i'll
go
on
to
clemons.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
clemons
had
stated
that
there
is
some
requirement
of
individualized
review.
and
in
particular,
it
said
a
weighing
state
may
allow
the
state
appellate
court
to
either
reweigh
or
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis
as
long
as
there
is
some
individualized
review
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
that
is
not
new
law.
that
has
been
in
the
rules
since
eddings,
zant,
and
barclay.
in
barclay,
for
example,
this
court
reviewed
an
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
not
constitutionally
invalid,
but
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
this
court
said
in
barclay
that
the
critical
question
was
whether
the
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
so
infected
the
balance
in
process
created
by
the
florida
statute
that
it
was
constitutionally
impermissible
to
allow
the
sentence
to
stand.
now
that
requires
individualized
review,
because
it
looks
at
the
statute,
the
florida
statute,
the
balancing
process
that
has
been
established,
and
it
requires
the
state
appellate
court
to
do
some
individualized
consideration
of
the
factors
that
were
presented
in
the
court
below.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
no,
sir.
there
was
more
language
in
barclay.
they
talked
about
barclay
applying
a
harmless
error
test.
they
considered
the
fact
that
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
introduced
in
barclay,
and
said
that
the
court,
the
florida
court
did
do
individualized
review
and
said
that
was
what
was
important.
the
specific
language
in
barclay
that
supports
our
position
that
said
what
is
required
is
some
individualized
review...
some
individualized
consideration
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
vast
majority
of
state
and
federal
courts
since
zant
and
barclay
have
understood
the
required
analysis.
they've
understood
first
you
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
vague
aggravating
circumstances
employed
in
the
sentencing
determination.
if
there
were,
then
the
court
had
to
do
some
determination,
individualized
determination
of
the
effect
of
those
aggravating
circumstances.
that
individualized
consideration
had
to
also
include
a
consideration
of
the
mitigating
factors
that
were
introduced
in
the
court
below.
mississippi
has
done
none
of
that.
and
it
stands
alone
in
doing
none
of
that
until
clemons.
this
court's
decisions
on
retroactivity
during
the
last
3
or
4
years
had
one
unifying
theme,
and
that
is
similarly
situated
persons
must
be
treated
alike.
and
for
that
reason
it's
particularly
important
that
the
two
basic
principles
that
james
stringer
asked
to
be
applied
in
his
case
have
already
been
applied
in
a
postconviction
context.
in
parker
v.
dugger,
this
court
applied
in
a
postconviction
context
the
principle
that
there
must
be
some
individualized
review
of
error.
there
was
a
question
of
whether
there
was
error.
the
state
of
florida
said
yes,
there
is
error
under
state
law,
and
apparently
did
not
apply
an
individualized
review,
either
a
harmless
error
test
or
a
reweighing.
and
this
court
said
that
at
a
minimum
some
individualized
review
is
required
applying
the
principles
in
clemons.
that
is
the
same
principle
that
james
stringer
seeks
to
have
applied
in
his
case.
it
has
already
been
applied
in
a
postconviction
context.
secondly,
in
lewis
v.
jeffers,
this
court
applied
the
basic
principal
that
james
stringer
seeks
to
have
applied
in
this
case...
in
his
case,
and
that
is
you
cannot
use
a
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
in
determining
sentence.
now,
the
question
again
in
lewis
v.
jeffers
was
on
the
periphery.
well,
had
arizona
developed
a
case
law
that
has
narrowed
the
construction
of
its
equivalent
of
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
not
applied
in
a
vague
way.
and
the
court
answered
that
question
yes.
but
the
basic
principle
that
you
cannot
use
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
was
accepted
and
there
was
no
debate
that
that
principle
should
be
applied
in
lewis
v.
jeffers.
in
conclusion,
this
court
was
right
to
apply
on
habeas
review
the
long-established
principles
that
were
the
premise
for
cartwright
and
clemons,
including
that
the
sentencer
cannot
rely
upon
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
and
if
the
sentencer
does
rely
on
such
circumstances,
there
must
be
some
type
of
individualized
review
by
the
state
appellate
court
to
cure
the
error.
that
was
a
law...
that
is
the
law
now
and
that
was
clearly
the
law
in
1985
when
james
stringer's
conviction
became
final.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
the
state's
basic
premise
is
that
a
state
could
reasonably
permit,
before
clemons
and
cartwright,
could
reasonably
permit
the
jury
to
consider
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
to
determine
eligibility
under
its
state's
statutory
scheme.
certainly
a
state
can
define
its
statutory
scheme
within
broad
contours.
but
if
that
state
has
determined
that
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
play
an
important
role
in
determining
eligibility
for
sentence,
as
mississippi
has,
each
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
must
meet
a
constitutional
narrow
standard
derived
from
furman.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
lowenfield
is
not
at
all
controlling,
and
that
has
no
relevance
to
the
question,
because
lowenfield
just
defines
the
point
where
there
has
to
be...
what
is
constitutionally
permitted
for
a
state
to
do.
louisiana
was
permitted
to
use
the
equivalent
of
aggravating
circumstances
at
the
definitional
stage
of
first-degree
murder.
mississippi
was
not
permitted,
and
lowenfield
does
not
address
what
has
happened
in
mississippi,
and
that
is...
and
in
this
case...
and
that
is
after
the
initial
narrowing
stage
is
met,
there
is
then
injected
a
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
which
the
jury
is
told
to
put
emphasis
on
and
rely
upon
in
determining
further
eligibility
for
a
sentence.
lowenfield
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
johnson
v.
thigpen,
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
did
the
fifth
circuit
find
that
mississippi's
construction
of
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel,
was
vague.
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
it
was
vague
in
johnson
v.
thigpen,
and
in
later
cases
assumed
that
it
had
no
narrowing
construction
that
had
been
consistently
applied.
and
it
was
only
after
it
had
got
to
that
point
that
it
then
decided
that
well,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
this
vague
aggravating
circumstance
played
a
role
in
determining
eligibility
for
punishment.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
they
were
wrong
on
that
under
zant.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
because
zant
said
that
it
was
constitutional
error
for
the
sentencer
to
consider
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
in
his
opinion
in
barclay,
called
what
this
court
did
in
zant
a
constitutional
harmless
error
test.
in
other
words,
there
was
constitutional
error,
and
what
the
court
did
in
zant
was
determine
whether
it
had
an
effect
on
the
sentencer.
and
the
determination
had
to
be
made
after
careful
scrutiny.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
your
honor,
the
question--
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
--your
honor,
the
question
is
yes,
but
what
was
left
open
was
whether
or
not
a
state
was
required
to
automatically
reverse
based
on
a
vague
stat...
in
a
weighing
state,
we
know
that
each
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
found
by
the
jury
plays
an
important
role.
that's
the
question
this
court
answered
against
the
petitioner
in
clemons
v.
mississippi.
and
in
zant,
that
was
the
question
the
court
was
also
asking.
under
georgia
law,
did...
was
the
state
of
georgia
required
to
automatically
reverse
when
the
sentencer
considered
a
vague
aggravating
circumstance?
and
it
said...
and
the
court
answered
the
question
about--
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
--clemons
reversed
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
that's
right,
your
honor.
[laughter]
and
not
a
single
justice
on
this
court
differed
on
the
analysis
that
the
court
applied
in
clemons.
it
was
understood
that
once
a
sentencer
relies
upon
a
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
that
there
is
error
and
the
state
must--
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
--the
counsel
opposite
has
argued
that
mississippi
does
not
limit
consideration,
the
weighing
stage,
to
just
statutory
aggravating
facts
supporting
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
and
that's
incorrect.
in
mississippi
has
interpreted
its
laws
very
narrowly
constraining
what
the
jury
may
consider
at
the
weighing
stage.
it
said...
it
has
said
in
coleman
v.
state
that
it
can
only...
the
jury
can
only
consider
facts
relevant
to
the
statutory
aggravated
circumstance.
and
that's
significant.
because
in
zant
the
question
asked
was
what
is
the
function...
the
constitutional
question
is
controlled
by
the
function
of
aggravating
circumstances
under
the
state
law.
well,
mississippi
said,
we
have
a
prominent
function
under
our
law,
and
yet
we're
still
going
to
ignore
the
effect
of
the
vague
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
without
any
individualized
review.
that
was
impermissible
as
of
zant,
that
was
impermissible
as
of
barclay
v.
florida.
and
specifically
in
california
v.
ramos,
this
court
said
that
what
gregg
meant
is
that
are
substantive
limitations
on
factors
that
a
sentencer
may
consider.
and
it
didn't
matter
what--
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
j.
rose
i
do
not
cite
it
in
my
brief.
but
the
state
cites
it
in
their
brief,
and
that's
why
i'm
responding
in
this
manner.
the
state
has...
the
state
has
raised
a
point
that
we
do
not
address,
as
justice
kennedy
stated
before,
we
do
not
address
because
we
considered
it
fundamental.
the
fundamental
principle...
and
this
court
considered
it
fundamental
in
maynard
v.
cartwright
and
clemons...
the
fundamental
principal
that
if
a
vague
aggravating
circumstance
is
injected
into
the
jury's
consideration,
there
is
constitutional
error.
because
that's
what...
that's
what
the
problem
was
in
furman.
that's
what
this
court
tried
to
cure,
or
allowed
to
be
cured,
in
gregg
v.
georgia
and
proffitt
v.
florida.
and
found
that
it
had
not
been
cured
in
the
particular
case
in
godfrey
v.
georgia.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
