we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-6616,
james
r.
stringer
v.
lee
roy
black.
mr.
rose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rose,
i
understand
mississippi
says
it
relied
on
zant.
clemons
has
been
decided.
we
know
that
mississippi
is
a
different
situation
from
georgia
in
that
respect.
but
so
far
as
a
new
rule
under
teague,
i
think
you
have
to
show
that
mississippi
was
not
entitled
to
rely
on
zant,
that,
if
you
would,
come
as
a
surprise
or
whatever
teague
said.
and
to
simply
show
that
the
two
systems
are
somewhat
different
i
don't
think
suffices.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that's
your
maynard
point,
that's
not
your
clemons
point,
to
go
back
to
the
fifth
circuit's
analysis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
that
probably
shows
your
case
is
different
from
zant,
but
i
think
you
have
to
go
further
in
teague
and
show
that
clemons
was
not
a
new
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
deduce
all
of
that
just
from
that
one
sentence
in
barclay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rose.
mr.
white,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
white.
mr.
rose,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
disagreed
with
the
fifth
circuit,
and
obviously
when
we
disagree
with
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rose,
you've
mentioned
california
v.
ramos
a
couple
of
times
in
your
oral
argument.
apparently
you
don't
cite
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rose.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-6616,
stringer
versus
black
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
