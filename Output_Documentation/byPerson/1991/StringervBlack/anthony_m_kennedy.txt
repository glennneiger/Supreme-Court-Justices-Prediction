justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
just
at
the
outset,
and
you
can
just
do
it
in
the
course
of
your
oral
argument,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
briefs
don't
meet
very
well.
mississippi
is
arguing
that
even
if
clemons
was
dictated
by
godfrey
as
to
the
content
of
the
aggravating
factor,
mississippi
wasn't
the
kind
of
state
that
georgia
was
or
that
florida
was
or
that
oklahoma
was.
and
that
i
didn't
see
addressed
in
your
brief.
so
i
hope
during
the
course
of
your
argument
you'll
make
that
clear
what
your
position
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
of
course,
the
further
question
is
whether
or
not
that's
a
new
rule
under
teague.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
mississippi
makes
an
important
point
that
it
has
to
be...
that
you
have
to
counter
when
it
says
that
this
simply
was
not
anticipated
as
of
the
time
of
clemons
because
of
the
differences
in
the
states,
in
the
two
states'
sentencing
schemes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
view
are
lowenfield
and
clemons
contradictory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
you
didn't
argue
that
in
clemons
and
we
didn't
address
it
in
clemons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
that
if
it
were
a
matter
of
a
new
rule
of
the
significance
you
say,
that
we
would
have
addressed
it
in
clemons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
correct
that
you
did
not
make
the
teague
argument
in
clemons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
that's
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
lowenfield
is
not
controlling
on
that
point
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
is
here
after
we
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
after
james
stringer
was
found
guilty
of
murder,
he
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
jury
in
a
mississippi
state
court.
the
jury
found
there
were
three
aggravating
factors,
but
one
of
them,
that
the
capital
murder
was
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
was
not
further
defined
or
explained
according
to
the
standards
that
we
have
set
forth
in
various
cases
including
one
case,
maynard
versus
cartwright.
maynard
versus
cartwright
was
decided
after
stringer's
conviction
became
final.
stringer's
conviction
was
affirmed
on
direct
review
and
he
failed
to
obtain
relief
in
collateral
proceedings
in
the
state
courts.
he
sought
relief
in
the
federal
court
system
and
after
various
proceedings
including
one
remand
from
us,
the
court
of
appeals
again
denied
relief.
stringer
is
the
petitioner
in
the
case
here
today.
the
case
turns
on
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
teague
versus
lane,
a
1989
case
from
this
court.
in
teague,
we
said
that
final
convictions
in
criminal
cases
are
not
to
be
upset
by
collateral
proceedings
based
on
new
principles
of
law
announced
after
the
convictions
are
final.
there
are
two
exceptions
to
teague
but
neither
is
applicable
in
stringer's
case.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
relief
stringer
seeks
would
require
the
application
of
principles
that
were
announced
after
his
conviction
and
sentenced
were
final.
we
have
little
difficulty
in
concluding
that
the
imprecision
in
the
jury
instruction
did
violate
then
settled
principles
and
indeed,
the
state
of
mississippi
appears
to
concede
as
much.
and
so
cases
such
as
maynard
versus
cartwright
did
not
break
new
ground
in
stringer's
case.
the
harder
question
is
whether
the
rules
we
have
set
forth
to
implement
our
standards
on
jury
instructions
are
also
retroactive
or
on
the
other
hand,
whether
they
are
a
new
law.
the
dispute
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
the
mississippi
courts
had
noticed
that
when
one
of
the
three
aggravating
factors
is
invalid,
they
have
a
duty
to
examine
the
evidence
and
reexamine
it
to
see
that
it
supported
the
death
sentence
and
reweigh
it
or
subject
it
to
harmless
error
analysis.
we
hold
that
the
requirements
of
reweighing
and
evaluating
for
harmless
error
were
not
new
rules
and
that
they
were
binding
on
the
mississippi
courts
when
stringer's
case
came
before
them.
it
is
argued
that
mississippi's
sentencing
system
is
different
from
the
system
used
in
the
states
where
we
have
required
disclose
appellate
scrutiny
because
mississippi
is
a
weighing
state
when
in
which
the
jury
balances
the
aggravating
factors
against
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence.
but
in
our
view,
this
serves
only
to
highlight
the
importance
of
appellate
scrutiny.
when
the
sentencing
body
is
told
to
weigh
an
invalid
factor
in
its
decision,
reviewing
court
may
not
assume
it
would
have
made
no
difference
if
the
thumb
had
been
removed
from
death
side
of
the
scale.
when
the
weighing
process
itself
has
been
skewed,
only
constitutional
harmless
error
analysis
or
reweighing
at
the
trial
or
appellate
level
can
suffice
to
guarantee
that
the
defendant
received
an
individualized
sentence.
we
think
this
result
is
dictated
by
our
decisions
prior
to
the
time
petitioner's
conviction
and
sentence
became
final.
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
join.
