and
was
lowenfield
v.
phelps
from
louisiana?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
we
say
there
that
only
one
narrowing
procedure
is
constitutionally
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
then,
the
state
is
permitted
to
use
vague
aggravating
circumstances
thereafter
if
it
wants
to,
is
that
the
theory
you
offer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
position
is
that
they
can
be
vague,
and
under
a
standard
that
you
would
apply
to
a
constitutional
inquiry,
but
still
stand
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
your...
so
that
maynard
doesn't
apply
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
gather
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
compared
itself
really
more
to
florida.
i
don't...
and
it
has
assumed
that
maynard
and
clemons
apply
to
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
you're
arguing
a
position
not
taken
by
your
state
supreme
court.
