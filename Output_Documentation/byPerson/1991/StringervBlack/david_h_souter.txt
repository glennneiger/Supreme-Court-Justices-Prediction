i
think
your
brother
is
arguing
that
you've
got
a
two-step
narrowing
procedure,
and
he
is
saying,
at
least
i
think
he's
saying
implicitly,
that
if
you
do
employ
a
two-step
narrowing
procedure,
the
standards
applicable
to,
we'll
say
the
second
step,
should
be
the
same
applicable
to
the
first
and
there's
nothing
new
about
applying
a
given
standard.
the
only
thing
different
about
your
situation
is
that
you
have
a
two-step
process
rather
than
a
one-step
process.
