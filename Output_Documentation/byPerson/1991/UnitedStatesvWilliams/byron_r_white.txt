justice
byron
r.
white
have
the
lower
courts
that
have
got
into
this,
as
you've
suggested
they
have,
do
they
rely
on
the
supervisory
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
say
that
it's
connected
with
the
requirement
of
having
a
grand
jury
indict.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no...
no
one
in
this...
does
anyone
in
this
case
suggest
that
there's
a
constitutional
basis
for--
justice
byron
r.
white
haven't
we
had
a
grand
jury
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
did
we
get
a
grand
jury
case
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
proper
for
you
to
challenge
page.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
proper
for
you
to
challenge
page
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
apply
for
an
en
banc
hearing
on
it,
wouldn't
it?
it
would
have
been
proper.
you're
just
suggesting--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
it
be
all
right
to
have
a
rule,
a
supervisory
rule,
that
just
tracks
your
manual?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
and
the
allegation
is
that
the
government
had
in
its...
had
in
its
possession
information
that
it
knew
would
necessarily
bar
an
indictment.
for
instance,
they
knew
that
this
person
was
a
minor
and
couldn't...
just
couldn't
be
indicted.
and
they
just
withheld
it.
and
they
were
going
to
withhold
it
all
though
the
trial,
apparently.
but
there's
a
motion
that
says...
and
there's
a...
do
you
suppose
that
the
district
court
should
just
dismiss
the
motion?
i
have
no
power
to
do
anything
about
it?
i
guess
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
flagrant
misconduct.
the
government
knew
he
wasn't
subject
to
indictment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
there
may
be
a
valid
narrow...
much
narrower
rule
than
the
tenth
circuit.
