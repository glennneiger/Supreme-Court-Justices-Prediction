chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-1972,
united
states
v.
john
h.
williams,
jr.--
general
starr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority,
mr.
starr,
for
answering
justice
o'connor's
question
that
the
use
of
perjurious
would
warrant
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
does
the
government
concede
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
that
would
be
open
to
try...
that
would
be
open
to
a
contested
hearing
as
to
whether
the
prosecutor
did
in
fact
use
perjurious
testimony?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
presented
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
embodying
the
question
you're
arguing.
the
court
granted
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
mr.
lang,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
preceding
years,
mr.
lang,
have
people
tried
to
enforce
the
government's
obligation
by
motions
to
dismiss?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
i
understand
that,
but
i
thought
another
part
of
counsel's
argument,
which
there's
no
need
for
you
to
address
unless
you
want
to,
is
that
this
rule
would
generate
a
number
of...
contested
motions
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
which
do
not
exist
simply
with
the
departmental
policy
in
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
statistics
reflect
how
many
such
contested
hearings
there
were,
as
well
as
how
many
resulted
in
dismissal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
refer
to
the
number
of
those
cases
in
which
there
were
hearings
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
government...
in
which
the
defendant
did
not
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
lang,
why
should
the
rule
with
respect
to
exculpatory
evidence,
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
be
any
different
than
the
rule
with
respect
to
hearsay
evidence,
which
the
court
said
in
the
costello
case
was
not
a
ground
for
objecting
to
a
grand
jury
indictment,
or
to
evidence
improperly
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
in
calandra,
the
court
said
was
not
a
basis
for
objecting
to
a
grand
jury
indictment?
it
seems
to
me
this
rule
just
goes
against
the
grain
of
that
line
of
cases
from
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
also
enforce
the
notion
that
the
courts
are
not
there
to
supervise
the
detailed
operations
of
the
grand
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
in
nova
scotia,
we
were
talking
about
a
very
specific
part
of
rule
6
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
as
i
recall
it.
here,
there
is
no
rule
laying
down
this
duty.
it
just
comes
out
of
thin
air.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
were
any
of
them
outside
of
these...
some
sort
of
specific
provision
of
law
governing
the
operation
of
either
the
grand
jury
or
some
other
part
of
the
government?
nothing
was
pulled
out
of
thin
air
in
nova
scotia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
before
you
get
to
the
prejudice
question,
you
need
to
find
a
violation
of
some
obligation.
then
you
get
to
the
prejudice
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
rather
substantial
assumption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lang.
general
starr,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
mr.
starr,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
start?
in
your
brief,
you
state
that
internal
department
of
justice
policies
are
sufficient
to
compel
prosecutors
to
disclose
substantial
known
exculpatory
evidence
to
the
grand
jury.
was
anything
along
that
line
done
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
and
judgment
in
united
states
against
williams
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
