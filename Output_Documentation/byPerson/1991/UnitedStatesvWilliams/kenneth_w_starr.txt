mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
an
issue
concerning
the
obligations
of
a
prosecutor
before
a
federal
grand
jury.
the
tenth
circuit
has
held
that
a
prosecutor
is
obligated,
on
pain
of
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
to
put
before
the
grand
jury
substantial
exculpatory
evidence.
as
a
result,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
dismissal
of
the
seven-count
indictment
in
this
case.
that
indictment
charged
in
effect
that
the
respondent
had
made
false
statements
to
four
federally
insured
institutions.
the
tenth
circuit's
rule
in
our
view
has
no
foundation
in
the
history
of
the
grand
jury.
and
if
it
is
adopted,
the
tenth
circuit's
approach
will
have
very
high
costs,
with
complicated
preliminary
trials
on
guilt
or
innocence
prior
to
the
trial
itself.
this
represents
a
change,
and
we
believe
it's
a
significant
change,
in
the
concept
of
the
grand
jury's
function.
the
grand
jury
is
a
screening
mechanism.
it
is
there
to
determine
whether
probable
cause
exists.
it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding,
and
thus
historically,
has
not
been
charged
with
evaluating
defenses.
indeed,
the
traditional
role
of
the
grand
jury
is
quite
limited.
as
justice
o'connor
stated
in
her
opinion
in
mechanik,
it
is
a
group
of
citizens
who
are
operating
with
a
broad
mandated
and
under
a
few
clear
rules.
those
rules
are
embodied
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
that
structure,
the
interposition
of
the
grand
jury
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
citizen
is
itself
a
protection
of
individual
liberty.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
our
position
is
no.
in
terms
of
failure
to
adduce
evidence,
as
opposed
to
what
courts
have,
seen
historically
is
quite
problematic.
and
that
is
the
use
of
perjurious
testimony
or
other
forms
of
flagrant
misconduct.
but
at
common
law--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
can.
i
think
it
does
need
to
take
the
issue
through
a
harmless
error
analysis
to
determine
whether
in
fact,
under
the
rules
of
this
court
as
articulated
in
nova
scotia,
that
that
was
harmless
error.
there
are
other
mechanisms.
in
short,
if
there's
been
wrongdoing
of
that
kind,
it
may
very
well
be
difficult
to
establish
that
it
was
harmless
error,
but
the
court
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
is
no
authority
in
this
court
that
directly
holds
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
government
has
no
quarrel,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
holdings
of
a
number
of
lower
federal
courts
that
have
concluded
that
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury
would
be
compromised
if
the
prosecutor
knowingly
uses
material...
i
would
insert
the
word
material...
perjurious
testimony.
that
is
to
say,
we
then
at
that
point
lack
confidence
in
exactly
what
the
grand
jury
was
doing.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
has
been,
and
the
system
has
not
suffered
as
a
result
of
that.
that,
we
view
it,
as
being...
although
this
court
has
not
spoken
directly
to
it...
the
law
in
any
number
of
circuits.
the
new
rule
that
the
tenth
circuit
has
now
imposed
would
have
enormous
costs
as
well
as
view
the
grand
jury
in
a
very
different
light.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
certainly
not
the
latter.
we
do
believe,
with
all
respect,
that
while
action
can
be
taken
with
respect
to
a
particular
prosecutor
for
conduct
before
the
court
in
a
particular
case,
we
do
have
difficulty
with
a
broad
use
of
the
idea
of
supervisory
power
to
tell
the
prosecutor
how
do
discharge
his
obligation.
if
i
may
now
return
to
what
our
reason
would
be
for
saying,
yes,
there
is
a
problem
in
that
grand
jury
testimony
because
essentially
the
nest
has
been
befouled.
it
has
been
befouled
by
the
knowing
use
of
testimony
that
is
perjurious,
and
the
grand
jury
may
very
well
have
acted
on
the
basis
of
that.
in
contrast,
as
blackstone,
as
we
note
in
footnote
3,
blackstone
noted
at
common
law
it
was
unheard
of
to
be
adducing
defenses
before
the
grand
jury.
that's
not
what
grand
juries
are
charged
with
doing.
they're
not
there
to
evaluation
culpability
in
the
sense
of
guilt
or
innocence.
they
are
simply
there
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
there
is
probable
cause
and
not
to
evaluate
defenses.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
use
that
to
make
the
point
that
courts
have
been
concerned
about
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury's
function
that
is
compromised
in
terms
of
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury's
judgement,
if
that
judgment
has
been
influenced
materially
by
evidence
that
is
perjurious
or
manufactured.
it
goes
to
the
idea
of
the
integrity
and
independence
of
the
grand
jury.
that's
what
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--they
typically
don't
lay
this
out,
justice
white,
carefully.
at
times
they
speak
in
terms
of
due
process,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
not
atypically,
the
analysis
is
in
one
or
two
sentences.
other
times
they
speak
in
terms
of
supervisory
powers.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
has
been
suggested
by
authorities
like
learned
hand
and
henry
friendly
that
in
fact
you
are
getting
at
the
core
notion
of
what
the
founders
had
in
mind,
which
is
a
grand
jury
whose
integrity
and
independence
is
respected
by
the
prosecutor,
and
the
prosecutor
fails
to
accord
it
that
respect
if
it's
using
perjurious
testimony.
again,
this
issue
is
light
years
away
from
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
tenth
circuit
did
not.
in
fact,
the
tenth
circuit,
both
in
the
page
case
and
in
this
case,
did
not
set
forth
a
foundation
or
basis
for
the
use
or
exercise
of
this
particular
power.
and
i
do
think
it
would
be
quite
extreme
to
incorporate
fundamental
fairness
due
process
notions
into
this,
since
as
we
know,
under
the
well-settled
holdings
of
this
court,
there
is
no
due
process
right
to
grand
jury
proceedings
in
many
states,
or
a
number
of
states...
i
shouldn't
say
many.
a
number
of
states
don't
have
grand--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
you've
had
grand
jury
cases
here,
but
you've
never
held
that's
required
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness,
and
this
my
point
is
this.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i'm
sorry,
this
is
a
federal
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
the
point
i'm
making
is
in
hurtado
v.
california,
there
was
a
due
process
challenge
to
the
failure
to
use
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
and
this
court
rejected
the
notion
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair,
as
we
would
say
in
modern
due
process
analysis,
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
that.
and
thus,
in
a
number
of
the
states,
a
prosecutor
can
sit
in
his
or
her
offices
and
simply
file
the
charging...
write
the
charging
materials,
and
not
be
taking
into
account
any,
quote,
exculpatory
evidence.
that's
the
limited
due
process
point.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
in
terms
of
this
proceeding
that
not
only
has
the
tenth
circuit
failed
to
adduce
a
constitutional
basis,
and
clearly
there's
no
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
speaks
to
this.
in
her
opinion,
justice
o'connor
spoke
about
the
few
clear
rules.
prosecutors
operate
under
the
aegis
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
rule
6
has
a
number
of
provisions.
and
we
must
scrupulously
abide
by
those
provisions.
this
is
new.
it
is
a
new
invention.
it
is
part
of
the
reform
effort
to
reform
the
grand
jury.
but
even
persons
and
commentators
who
have
viewed
the
grand
jury
as
standing
in
need
of
reform
have
not
gone
this
far.
judge
frankel,
in
his
book,
says,
yes,
it's
a
good
idea,
but
you
certainly
don't
want
to
turn
the
process
into
a
preliminary
trial
before--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
i
would
draw
the
line.
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
and
i
would
draw
the
line...
now,
i
don't
think
we
can
articulate
it
at
general
level
of
are
you
in
any
way
misleading
the
grand
jury.
the
question
is
what--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
is
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
is.
i
think
conceptually
it
is.
that
is
a
defense
that
comes
on
at
trial.
and
what
courts
have
held
is
here...
remember,
the
grand
jury
is
not
sitting
there.
and
if
the
court
reads
the
grand
jury
transcript
in
this
case,
they
will
see
the
grand
jury
wasn't
just
sitting
there.
they
were
asking
questions.
so
they
can
ask
questions
and
they
can
say...
and
that's
where...
and
that's
the
line
that
has
been
drawn
in
the
lower
court
cases.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
will
withdraw
the
light
years,
but
it
is
a
clear
distinction
that
we
think
is
fundamental
in
terms
of
what
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
is.
you
should
not,
in
fact,
use...
you
should
not
engage
in
what
courts
have
come
in
a
common
law
form
of
analysis,
to
characterize
as
flagrant
misconduct.
the
use--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
first
all,
i
view
that
as
distinct
for
reasons
already
stated,
but
here,
i
think,
is
a
very
important
point,
that
this
court
has
noted
in
calandra.
what
is
the
rationale,
what
is
the
reasoning
of
a...
what's
the
incentive
for
a
prosecutor
to
do
that?
it
makes
no
sense.
he's
going
to
have
turn
over
brady
material,
and
he
is
also
going
to
see
his
case
fall
apart
at
trial.
and
if
you
look
at
our
conviction
rate,
our
cases
don't
fall
apart
at
trial.
we
have
over
a
90
percent
conviction
rate.
this
is
a
very
professional
process
in
the
federal
system.
and
i
say
that
by
what--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
certainly
this
court
in
nova
scotia
pointed
to
remedies
such
as
referral
to
the
office
that
attorney
general
levy
established,
the
office
of
professional
responsibility
in
the
justice
department,
which
receives
complaints
of
this
nature.
justice
kennedy,
in
nova
scotia,
suggested
if
a
prosecutor
is
engaged
in
inappropriate
or
improper
conduct,
you
can
note
that
in
a
published
opinion
that
has
very
powerful
effects.
there
was...
in
the
mechanik
case,
the
district
judge
in
that
case
was
concerned
about
6(d)
violations
in
the
grand
jury
room,
and
so
the
judge,
the
district
judge
said
i
want
an
occasional
report
from
the
prosecutor
as
to
are
you
complying
with
6(d).
i
don't
want
to
get
this
court
into
the
situation
of
having
to
hear
motions
to
dismiss
and
dismissing
the
indictments.
it's
an
inefficient
way
to
do
it.
but
the
basic
point,
as
justice
powell,
in
calandra
pointed
out,
is
there's
no
incentive
for
this.
and
we're
talking
about
what
should
the
system
be.
should
there
be
a
system
that
is
clearly
going
to
have
enormous
costs,
and
a
double-header
cost,
both
in
terms
of
what
the
defense
counsel
is
seeking
to
do
to
guide
the
grand
jury
to
say
here
are
my
10
exculpatory
witnesses.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
is
a
possible
incentive,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
because
we
were
operating
under
page,
justice
stevens.
that
was
the
law--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
did
say...
we
have
preserved
this
issue,
as
we
indicated
in
our
certiorari
petition.
the
question
was
passed
on
by
the
lower
court.
we
did
not
challenge
page
directly
in
the
lower
court
because
that
was
the
law
of
the
circuit,
and
the
government
won
in
page,
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
by
mr.
page.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
did
say
that
there
is
absolutely
no
obligation
on
our
part
to
do
what
we
have
been
required
to
do
under
these
circumstances.
when
we--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--what
we
are
taking
issue
with
is
the
law
of
the
tenth
circuit
that
has
now
been
applied
to
us
in
a
case
that
we
have
lost.
and
we
ordinarily
do
not,
justice
stevens,
go
into
a
court
of
appeals
when
the
law
of
the
circuit
is
settled
and
say
we
don't
like
the
law
of
the
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
as
long
as...
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
that,
and
in
cases,
with
respect
to
have
you
passed
upon
the
issue
of
whether
in
fact
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
was
withheld.
if
that
has
been,
and
that
was
ruled
again...
we
were
ruled
against
in
that
particular
issue.
and
we
have
now
brought
before
this
court
a
question.
and
that
question
fairly
encompasses
this
rule.
the
underlying
duty
that
was
articulated
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
page,
to
say
you
must
always
adduce
substantial
exculpatory
evidence.
now
our
concern,
justice
stevens,
picking
up
with
your
point,
with
the
way...
and
i
think
it
shows
the
perniciousness
of
the
tenth
circuit's
approach...
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
8a
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
will
see
how
loose
and
far
reaching
the
substantial
exculpatory
standard
is,
as
articulated
by
the
tenth
circuit.
it
is
very
broad
and
sweeping,
indeed.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
under
the
law
of
the
circuit--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
united
states
attorney
was
not
challenging
page,
per
se,
but
he
was
saying
the
substantial
exculpatory
evidence
duty
is
one
that
obviously
we
are
going
to
have
to
seek
to
comply
with,
and
we
think
that
we
have
complied
with
it.
but
the
question
was
in
fact
passed
on
by
this
court,
by
the
tenth
circuit,
is
there
a
duty,
what
is
the
nature
of
that
duty,
and
it
has
determined
that
we
failed
in
that
duty.
we--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
did
not...
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
it
is
odd
to
suggest...
and
if
we
want
to
litigate
aggressively
everything
in
the
circuits
and
challenge
any
particular
case
before
each
and
every
panel,
i
think
that
is
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
i
think
that
is
not
the
approach
this
court
has
traditionally
used.
it
is
the
question
that
that
this
court
has
looked
to
is
has
the
court
passed
upon
the
issue.
and
here,
the
tenth
circuit
passed
upon
the
issue
and
resolved
it
against
the
government.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
and
it's
especially
odd
in
page
when
in
fact,
in
judge
logan's
opinion
he
articulates
the
duty,
and
then
he
says,
there's
no
problem
with
the
duty
here.
if
the
court
pleases,
not
to
pass
on
this
question
would
leave
a
very
clear
circuit
conflict
unresolved.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
and
the
other
side
in
its
opposition
took
the
position
that
we
had
failed
to
preserve
it
and
the
like
for
these
reasons.
we
responded
to
that
in
our
reply
brief,
and
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
presented.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct,
but
at
least
the
court
was
informed
by
the
fact
that
we
had
presented
this
issue,
that
they
were
fully
aware
of
the
posture
of
the
case
before
the
tenth
circuit.
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
is
here
to
address
this
issue,
let
me
focus,
in
the
brief
moments
that
remain,
on
what
we
see
as
the
practicality
of
this.
here
is
what
is
happening,
and
it
is
what
is
going
to
happen.
defense
counsel
will
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
judges
will
then
be
called
upon
to
analyze,
for
example,
five
volumes
of
a
bankruptcy
deposition
and
other
allegedly
exculpatory
evidence.
there
will
be
many
disputes
over
that.
i
commend
to
the
court's
attention
judge
ellison's
second
opinion.
note
that
when
he
first
heard
the
evidence,
he
said,
no.
this
isn't
a
violation
of
the
page
duty;
they've
done
all
that
they
need
to
do.
and
again,
if
the
court
reads
the
grand
jury
transcripts,
they
will
see
this
was
a
very
thorough-going
grand
jury
investigation.
it
then
comes
back
to
the
judge
on
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
in
footnote
3
of
his
opinion
granting
the
motion
for
reconsideration
after
having
once
denied
it,
he
notes
a
number
of
items
of
allegedly
substantially
exculpatory
evidence
that
were
proffered
to
him,
which
he
says,
i
still
think
those
were
not
substantially
exculpatory.
these
are
going
to
be
difficult
judgment
calls.
it
is
going
to
be
the
exact
sort
of
confusion-producing
litigation...
litigation
producing
confusion,
i
should
say,
that
this
court
should
seek
to
avoid.
the
criminal
justice
system
need
predictability
and
it
needs
certainty.
and
this
is
a
sure
recipe
for
enormous
uncertainty.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
it
was.
two
individuals
were
called
before
the
grand
jury
to
testify
about
the
joint
venture
investments
in
which
mr.
williams
had
invested
very
heavily
and
in
which
he,
according
to
his
bankruptcy
testimony,
had
confidence,
into
the
efficacy
of
that.
i
won't
characterize
the
testimony.
this
is
obviously
protected
by
grand
jury
secrecy,
but
this
is
in
the
record.
secondly,
he...
the
united
states
attorney
who
personally
conducted
this
grand
jury
investigation,
called
before
the
grand
jury
two
representatives
from
the
accounting
firm,
the
in-house
accounting
firm
that
handles
the
williams'
family
accounts.
and
in
fact,
that
had
been
suggested
that
that
be
done.
and
so
they
testified
with
respect
to
what
the
accounting
techniques
were.
i
commend
that
testimony
as
well.
what
was
also
before
the
grand
jury
here
was
a
criminal
referral
from
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
statements
by
a
number
of
bank
officers,
who
testified
not
only
about
his
financial
statements,
and
how...
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
here
that
the
financial
statements
do
not
conform
to
gap.
but
more
than
that,
what
he
was
saying
to
the
bank
presidents
when
he
was
seeking
these
loans.
the
grand
jury
had
a
very
full
picture
before
it.
with
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
transcript
itself,
that
is
classic
hearsay,
self-serving
testimony.
it
was
not
subject,
by
definition,
to
cross-examination
by
the
government.
and
frankly,
although
i'm
sensitive
to
revealing
anything
before
the
grand
jury,
i
think
that
a
review
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
will
satisfy
the
court
in
this
case
that
the
grand
jury
had
before
it
the
fact
that
mr.
williams
had
the
sense
of
optimism.
in
fact,
the
united
states
attorney
put
before
the
grand
jury
testimony
about
his
character,
his
character
in
a
very
positive
sense.
the
united
states
attorney
did
not
seek
to
cut
this
off.
when
witnesses
would
say,
i
wish
we
could
have
done
better
with
these
investments,
he
didn't
cut
him
off.
the
grand
jury
transcript
shows
a
very
moral
prosecution
conducted
with
integrity.
with
respect
to
the
rule,
now,
that
is
being
urged
upon
this
court,
the
department
of
justice
policy
speaks
in
terms
of
substantial
evidence
that
directly
negates
guilt.
for
starters,
that's
not
the
tenth
circuit's
standard,
either
at
page
or
in
this
case.
secondly--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
am
not.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point,
justice
white.
that
is
department
of
justice
policy.
it
has
historically
been
the
policy.
it
is
not,
however,
legal
error.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
he
has
power
to
do
something
about
it,
but
he
should
not
dismiss
the
indictment.
no.
even
under
those
circumstances,
if
there
was
not
flagrant
misconduct
in
the
use
of
perjurious
testimony
and
the
like,
then
no.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
again,
what
is
being
urged
here
is
a
rule
that
goes
against
what
is
a
pathological
case.
to
trap
that
pathological
prosecutor,
what
the
tenth
circuit
is
urging
essentially
upon
the
system
is
a
very
costly
rule
when
the
incentives
are
entirely
to
the
contrary.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
there
are
also
narrower
remedies
than
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
if
there
is
in
fact
a
bad
apple
in
the
prosecutorial
barrel,
there
is
hardly
anything
more
effective
than
sanctioning
that
attorney
for
contempt
of
court,
for
singling
him
out,
or
her
out,
for
criticism
in
a
published
opinion,
which
again,
this
court
has
emphasized
as
a
remedy.
that
is
a
powerful
remedy.
it
is
not
easy
simply
to
go
back
to
the
grand
jury,
justice
white,
as
my
colleague
has
suggested.
these
issues,
by
the
way,
arise
in
white
collar
crime
cases.
they
don't
arise
in
other
kinds
of
cases,
typically,
where
the
issue
is
intent.
these
are
complicated
proceedings.
these
financial
fraud
investigations
are
enormously
complex.
you
don't
simply
go
back
at
almost
zero
cost
and
get
an
indictment.
you've
got
to
present
this
elaborate
case
once
again.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
this
prosecution
can
go
forward
because
this
case
still
lives
and
the
statute
is
tolled
while
this
issue
is
being
litigated.
but
again,
one
of
the
things
in
terms
of
the
presentation
before
the
district
court
is
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
testimony
of
bank
presidents
who
will
talk
about
oral
representations.
that's
a
part
of
this
indictment.
and
that
has
not
been
before
the
district
court
at
all.
i
thank
the
court.
