justice
john
paul
stevens
--general
starr,
let
me...
may
i
interrupt
you?
you
say
there's
no
incentive
to
do
this.
that's
true
if
you
have
a
professional
prosecutor
who's
only
interested
in
doing
his
job.
it's
not
necessarily
true
if
you
have
a
politically
motivated
prosecutor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
possible
incentive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
second
question
i'd
like
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'd
like
to
ask
you
is,
as
i
understand
it,
you
could
win
this
case
on
one
of
two
theories:
either
that
there's
no
duty
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor,
or
alternatively,
that
he
didn't
violate
the
duty
in
this
case
because
the
evidence
isn't
all
that
important.
now
is
it
not
correct
that
in
the
lower
court,
the
government
took
the
position
there
was
a
duty,
and
they
complied
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
challenge
page
in
the
lower
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
you
did
not
raise
the
same
question
you're
raising
here
in
the
lower
court
because
you
did
not
challenge
page.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
didn't
say
there
was
no
obligation
of
the
kind
you're
describing
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you
want
review
in
this
court
of
that
very
point
that
you
say
is
hamstringing
your
ability
to
bring
cases
and
all
the
rest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's
quite
different
say
the
rule
is
too
broad
and
acknowledge,
as
you
did
in
your
brief
there,
that
you
have
certain
responsibilities
to
produce
evidence,
which
you
did
acknowledge
in
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
passed
on
in
the
sense
of
duty
being
there
because
the
government
had
conceded
it
had
the
duty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
intend
to
bring
it
here,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
four
votes
don't
necessarily
decide
whether
that'll
decide
the
case.
