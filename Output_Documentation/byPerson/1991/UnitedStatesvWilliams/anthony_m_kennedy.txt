but
just
before
we
leave
this
point
where
you
admit
or
concede,
i
think,
but
there
is
some
room
for
court
intervention
if
there
is
flagrant
misconduct,
use
of
perjurious
testimony.
but
what
is
the
reason
why
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed?
because
the
grand
jury
right
has
not
been
accorded
to
the
petitioner?
or
because
we
have
the
duty
to
supervise
the
government
in
the
prosecution
of
its
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
befouled
nest
is
not
a
grand
jury
hearing?
i
mean,
is
that
the
formula?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose,
counsel,
that
in
the
case
that
we
were
discussing
with
justice
scalia
a
few
minutes
ago.
there's
a
series
of
boxes
with
exculpatory
evidence,
and
the
prosecution
said...
tells
the
grand
jury,
we
haven't
read
these;
they're
here
if
you're
interested.
and
the
grand
jury
says
we're
not
interested.
and
it
contains
substantial
exculpatory
evidence.
is
there
a
problem
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
i'm
asking
is
suppose
the
grand
jury
doesn't
do
its
job.
it's
very
sloppy.
and
the
prosecution
says
if
you've
heard
enough,
tell
us.
we
have
more
if
you're
interested.
and
the
grand
jury
said,
well,
we
don't
really
care.
we've
heard
enough.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
my
question
is
designed
to
elicit
is
whether...
a
discussion
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
standard
to
which
the
grand
jury
must
be
held
or
a
standard
to
which
the
prosecution
must
be
held.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
so
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned,
if
there's
a
defalcation,
it's
equally
harmful
in
either
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
the
grand
jury
is
remiss
on
its
own,
or
whether
the
prosecution
is
remiss.
it
makes
no
difference
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant.
