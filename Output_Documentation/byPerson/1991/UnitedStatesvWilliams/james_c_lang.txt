mr.
james
c.
lang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
at
the
outset
it's
important
to
note
the
departmental
policy
of
requiring
the
submission
by
prosecutors
to
the
grand
jury
of
substantial
exculpatory
evidence,
which
has
been
in
effect
for
approximately
13
years,
if
my
computation
is
correct.
and
we've
operated
under
that
in
this
justice
system,
and
the
government
has
operated
under
that
as
an
internal
policy
for
that
period
of
time,
without
it
wrecking
havoc
on
the
system.
so
we
have
here
a
rather
unique
situation,
whereby
actually
the
government
has
followed,
apparently,
their
policy
of
submitting
this
evidence
to
the
grand
juries.
the
system
hasn't
crumbled.
mr.
james
c.
lang
no,
your
honor,
but
i'm
addressing
again
the
argument
or
position
that
was
made
by
counsel
relative
to
the
difficulty
that
would
be
incurred
in
the
government
determining
what
was
exculpatory
and
presenting
it
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
c.
lang
yes.
in
regard
to
that
aspect
of
the
argument,
the
government,
under
its
brady
obligation
at
the
commencement
of
the
proceedings
after
the
indictment,
is
going
to
have
to
marshal
its
exculpatory
evidence
in
any
event.
they're
going
to
have
to
know
what
is
exculpatory
at
that
point
in
time,
because
they're
going
to
have,
assuming
an
indictment
is
returned,
a
brady
obligation.
so
subsequently
from
the
viewpoint
again
of
the
difficulty
of
submitting
it
and
knowing
what
it
is,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant
at
that
point
in
time.
now,
as
far
as
there
being
a
rash
of
motions
in
regard
to
this
proceeding,
i
think
over
the
past...
as
cited
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
government,
over
the
past
10
years,
there
have
been
fewer
than
10
cases
that
ultimately
a
dismissal
has
resulted
on
some
such
basis.
so
the
impact,
i
submit,
is
not
great.
mr.
james
c.
lang
i
believe
in
a
reply
brief
it
refers
to
over
200,000
indictments...
204,000
indictments
as
opposed
to
the
10
cases
that
ultimately
ended
in
that
manner.
mr.
james
c.
lang
no,
your
honor,
because
again
that
would
not
be
a
statistic
gathered
by
the
government.
i
might
point
out,
because
there
was
some
question
also
earlier,
in
terms
of
the
cumbersome
nature
of
the
five
volumes
of
the
testimony
that
were
obtained
from
a
parallel
bankruptcy
proceeding,
sometimes,
when
we're
talking
about
situations
involving
financial
institutions
and
the
element
of
intent,
particularly
when
it
gets
to
a
situation
of
whether
a
bank
was
misled
under
18
u.s.c.
1014,
the
idea
gets
to
be...
well,
this
is
such
a
vague
situation,
how's
anyone
going
to
know
whether
this
is
actually
exculpatory
and
goes
to
that
issue.
in
regard
to
this
particular
case,
the
trial
court
was
quite
specific,
referring
not
only
to
specific
items
that
were
explained
by
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
that
went
to
the
exact
issue,
the
same
transcript
that
was
not
given
to
the
grand
jury,
the
same
transcript
that
in
great
detail,
in
five
volumes,
explained
why
the
balance
sheet
and
income
statement
was
correct
and
why
the
defendant
believed
it
was
correct,
his
beliefs
concerning
the
asset
values
that
he
placed
on
the
assets
that
were
the
subject
of
the
financial
statements,
and
a
very
thorough
discussion
in
this
particular
situation
of
the
venture
capital
investments
that
this
particular
defendant
had
made
and
why
he
believed
the
numbers
that
he
placed
on
those
venture
capital
investments
were
accurate.
so
we
have
here
a
situation
where
not
only
are
there
documents
that
are
explained,
but
we
have
a
lengthy
explanation
by
the
defendant
as
to
why
he
felt
and
why
he
believed
that
his
financial
statements
were
accurate.
so
even
though
this
be,
again,
a
case
involving
a
bank
violation,
it
is
a
case
whereby
the
exculpatory
nature
of
it
is
clear.
and
it
was
not
submitted,
of
course,
to
the
grand
jury,
which
very
well
could
have
reviewed
the
five
volumes
and
determined
that
this
man
really
felt
that
these
values
were
the
values
that
were
correct.
mr.
james
c.
lang
well,
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that
point,
because
actually--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
c.
lang
assuming
the
rule...
assuming
the
rule,
obviously
in
certain
complex
criminal
situations...
to
take
that
one
or
several
steps
further...
when
you
bring
in
the
50
boxes,
to
have
a
meaningful
rule,
there
has
to
be
a
meaningful
ability
to
understand.
mr.
james
c.
lang
in
this
case,
your
honor,
confining
it
to
this
case,
the--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--in
order
for
it
to
be
meaningful,
your
honor,
and
for
there
to
be
a
meaningful
rule,
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
meaningful
submission.
mr.
james
c.
lang
now,
in
this
particular
case,
of
course
we
have
the
luxury
of
the
5
volumes,
which
could
very
well
have
been
read
by
the
grand
jury,
as
opposed
to
the
40
boxes,
which
fully
explain
the
particular
aspects
of
the
balance
sheet.
i
might
point
out
also
in
this
case,
that
the
government
could
have,
as
a
matter
of
interest,
simply
following
the
decision
of
judge
ellison,
pointing
out
that
there
were
certain
items
that
the
court
felt
were
exculpatory
and
should
have
been
viewed
by
the
grand
jury,
simply
turned
around
and
submitted
those
items
to
the
grand
jury,
or
another
grand
jury.
however,
rather
than
do
this
rather
simple
thing,
we've
gone
through
this
appellate
procedure.
the
point,
and
my
reason
in
mentioning
that
is
that
in
respond...
or
as
a
rejoinder
to
the
argument
that
this
would
create
some
massive
problem
in
the
criminal
system,
it's
very
easy
for
the
government,
once
the
court
finds
there's
some
exculpatory
evidence
that
should
have
been...
or
substantial
exculpatory
evidence,
to
simply
turn
around
and
present
it.
there's
no
prohibition
against
that.
mr.
james
c.
lang
well,
the
rule
would
in
our
view,
your
honor,
be
confined
to
a
situation
of
evidence
in
the
possession
of
the
government.
there'd
be
no
duty
to
seek
out.
because
in
our
case--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--if
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
and
it
had
the
50
boxes
in
its
possession,
which
were
accumulated
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
it
again
would
have
the
duty
to
go
through
the
boxes,
to
find
the...
or
the
present
the
evidence
in
a
circumstance.
now,
of
course
we
can
take
this
further
down
the
road
and
determine
how
many
boxes
and
how
it
got
it,
and
what
the
circumstances
were
as
to
how
they
came
by
it.
but
by
the
same
token
in...
again,
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
knew
it
had
the
evidence
in
its
possession.
it's
not
a
question
them
having
something
in
their
investigation
they
really
didn't
know
about.
here
it's
confined
to
knowledge.
mr.
james
c.
lang
yes.
mr.
james
c.
lang
that
line
of
cases
support
the
notion
that
the
grand
jury
should
have
before
it
all
possible
evidence,
even
though
it
be
inadmissible,
even
though
it
be
seized
in
some
manner
that
wouldn't
be...
where
it...
wouldn't
be
allowed
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
those
case
enforce
the
original
notion
that
the
grand
jury
should
have
access
to
all
evidence
that
can
come
within
its
scope
in
order
to
be
fully
informed.
mr.
james
c.
lang
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
again,
assuming
there
are
circumstances
that
create
the
supervisory
duty
of
the
courts
under
the
nova
scotia
test.
mr.
james
c.
lang
your
honor,
nova
scotia
considered
not
only
the
rule
6(e)
and
6(d)
violations,
but
also
considered
conduct
before
the
grand
jury,
such
as
the
prosecutor
yelling
at
a
witness
in
the
presence
of
a
grand
juror
and
also
the
prosecutor
improperly
summarizing
some
evidence.
so
in
the
totality
of
that
decision,
there
were
some
circumstances
outside
the
rule
6
considered.
mr.
james
c.
lang
no.
well,
your
honor,
these
two
particular
concerns
were
decided
strictly
under
the...
as
part
of
the
totality
of
the
rule
6(e)
and
6(t)...
(d)
violation,
but
they
were
considered
as
being
important
in
making
that
determination.
so
i
don't
think
pulled
out
of
the
air
is
quite
right,
but
by
the
same
token,
the
court
looked
at
them
to
determine
whether
the
prejudice
standard
was
met.
and
i
think--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
again,
assuming
that
the
violation
in
this
case
would
emanate
from
the
same
source
as
the
consideration
in
nova
scotia,
then
you
would
have
the
violation
for
the
purpose
of
the
prejudice
problem...
the
sources
that
i
mentioned
as
far
as
that
consideration.
mr.
james
c.
lang
your
honor,
i
might
mention--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
of
course,
under
the
court's...
hypothetical
case,
the
documents
would
be
before
the
grand
jury.
and
they
would
have
the
option--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--well,
the
grand...
again,
the
grand...
assuming
the
grand
jury
felt
that
they
had
heard
enough,
i
don't
know
what
the
prosecutor
could
do
in
terms
of
doing
more
than
giving
it
to
them.
mr.
james
c.
lang
well,
and
that's
very
correct,
your
honor.
because
again,
the
rule
that's
involved
in
this
tenth
circuit
case
has
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
grand
jury.
and
the
duty
that
we're
speaking
of
here
is
the
duty
relative
to
the
prosecutor
to
see
that
if
there
is
in
his
possession
in
the
course
of
his
investigation
certain
substantial
exculpatory
evidence
that
it
is
provided
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
c.
lang
equally
harmful
whether
the
grand
jury
doesn't
accept
the--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--that
is
correct.
but
by
the
same
token,
the
grand...
the
prosecutor
generally
in
today's
world
is
the
sole
source
of
all
of
the
evidence
that
goes
before
the
grand
jury.
so
the
issue
then
is
should
some
obligation
be
placed
upon
the
prosecutor,
who
generally
is
the
spoon
feeder
to
the
grand
jury,
to
make
sure
that
if
he
becomes
in
possession
of
substantial
exculpatory
evidence,
that
it
then
is
conveyed
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
c.
lang
supervisory
power,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
lang
i
believe
the
tenth
circuit
did.
they
followed
the
language
of
nova
scotia
in
determining
the
prejudice
and
spoke
of
supervisory
power,
and
made
the
finding
or
found
that
the
findings
of
judge
ellison
were
not
clearly
erroneous
in
that
there
was
substantial
exculpatory
evidence
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecutor,
and
that
it
impacted,
under
the
language
of
nova
scotia.
mr.
james
c.
lang
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
so
we
actually
have
here,
for
the
purpose
of
the
consideration,
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
has
been
found
not
to
be
clearly
erroneous
by
the
tenth
circuit,
that
there
was
substantial
exculpatory
evidence,
that
it
was
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecutor,
and
that
it
impacted
on
the
decision
of
the
grand
jury
to
indict,
following
completely
the
logic
and...
of
nova
scotia,
ultimately
resulting
in
the
dismissal.
and
as
i
said,
the
upshot
of
the
whole
thing
was
the
prosecutor
had
the
option
at
that
point
simply
to
take
what
was
considered
to
be
substantially
exculpatory,
and
take
it
back
before
another
grand
jury,
and
then
to
see
if
another
indictment
might
be
obtained.
if
one
was
not
returned,
if
one
were
not
returned
by
another
grand
jury,
then
perhaps
the
basic
reason
why
we
would
have
the
rule
would
be
proved.
it
may
well
be
that
they
would
take
the
deposition,
read
through
it,
find
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
a
very
intelligent
and
articulate
gentleman,
find
that
he
was
very
educated,
find
that
the
tried
to
do
what
he
thought
was
right
in
preparing
his
financial
statements,
and
not
indict.
mr.
james
c.
lang
and
that's
the
whole
reason
behind
the
rule.
mr.
james
c.
lang
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
of
course
the
grand
jury--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--okay.
that
issue
was
raised
in
the
brief
in
terms
of
can
the
court
determine
what
is
substantial
evidence,
and
there
were
cited
in
the
briefs
the
other
use
or
uses
in
other
areas
of
the
law--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--in
the
trial
court...
and
my
definition
would
relate
to
whether
ultimately
there
might
be,
or
whether
it
is
sufficient
evidence
which
cumulatively
or
singularly
would
cause
a
jury
to
not
be
able
to
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that's
what
the
trial
court
in
this
court
did.
and
he
mentions
in
the
opinion
that
he
didn't...
that
was
his
view
of
that.
mr.
james
c.
lang
in
this
case,
that's
what
was
done.
mr.
james
c.
lang
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
definition
that
we
would
urge
on
the
court
since
that
was
what
was
done
in
this
case.
and
that
was
the
view
after
the
judge
looked
at
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
submitted...
tested
it
in
connection
with
the
nova
scotia
analysis
to
find
that
there
was
substantial
exculpatory
evidence.
mr.
james
c.
lang
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part
of--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--well,
i
think
the
logic
behind
the
rule
has
been
that
if
there's
not
sufficient
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
or
if
the
evidence
is
before
the
grand
jury
and
is
substantially
exculpatory,
that
might
be
sufficient
to
cause
them
not
to
be
able
to
find
ultimately
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
efficiencies
involved
in
ultimately
them
not
returning
the
indictment
and
also
the
protection
of
the
defendant
in
not
being
indicted
is
the
focus.
mr.
james
c.
lang
well,
the
grand
jury's
function,
of
course,
is
only
to
find
probable
cause.
and
if--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--well...
and
again,
i
think
the
focus
here
is
on
how
we're
defining
substantial
exculpatory
evidence,
and
whether
it's
entitled
to
before
the
grand...
before
the
grand
jury,
as
opposed
to
the
situation--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--correct.
but
there
seems
to
be
two
different
things
we're
speaking
about
here.
one
is
the
issue
of
the
standard
before
the
grand
jury
as
far
as
the
proof
and
regard
to
probable
cause.
and
another
seems
to
be
the
issue
of
what
the
definition
of
substantial
exculpatory
evidence
is,
and
whether
that
should
be
submitted
to
the
grand
jury.
that
is,
what...
when
is
the
evidence...
the...
when
does
the
exculpatory
evidence
reach
a
point
of
becoming
substantial.
which
seems
to
be,
again,
two
different,
almost
an
apples-and-oranges
analysis
in
the
sense
that
one
has
to
do
with
when
the
evidence
has
to
be
presented.
the
other
has
to
do
with
what
the
standard
is
in
regard
to
the
grand
jury
and
in
regard
to
this
trial.
so,
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question,
but
there
seems
to
be
two
different
analyses
involved
in
that.
the...
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
difference
in
what
the
grand
jury
is
today
and
get
back
on
a
point
i
made
a
minute
ago
in
regard
to
what
it
was
some
years
ago.
today,
the
grand
jury
relies
100
percent,
in
reality,
on
the
prosecutor.
in
times
past,
grand
juries
were
members
of
the
community,
they
had
a
good
deal
of
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on.
today,
that's
simply
not
the
case,
as
certain...
certainly
experience
would
tell
us.
today,
the
grand
jury
is
the
recipient
of
evidence
subpoenaed,
obtained,
acquired
by
the
prosecutor.
they
have
literally
no
independent
source
of
the
evidence.
the
agencies
collect
the
evidence
by
either
investigation
or
subpoena,
and
they're
provided
to
the
grand
jury
through
the
offices
of
the
prosecutor.
the
grand
jury
then
looks
at
the
evidence
and
makes
a
determination
as
far
as
the
indictment
is
concerned.
but
the
law
in
all
of
the
cases
are
clear
that
in
order
to
make
a
decision,
that
the
grand
jury
must
be
fully
informed.
they
must
in
all
instances,
whether
they
receive
the
evidence...
excuse
me...
whether
they
receive
the
evidence
that
might
not
be
admissible
in
court,
whether
they
receive
the
evidence
that's
substantial
exculpatory
evidence,
the
policy
is
to
get
before
the
grand
jury
all
possible
evidence.
and
this
rule
that
was
laid
down
by
the
tenth
circuit
would
effectuate
the
same
policy
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
of
getting
before
the
grand
jury
all
possible
evidence
relative
to
the
particular
case.
mr.
james
c.
lang
well,
if
the
rule,
again,
is
that
they
should
have
available
to
them
all
possible
evidence,
and
there
is
substantial
exculpatory
evidence--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--that's
tendered
to
them,
and
they
say,
stop,
we're
drowning
in
boxes,
we
don't
want
any
more
of
this.
mr.
james
c.
lang
a
circumstance,
again,
that
we
don't
have
in
this
case.
mr.
james
c.
lang
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
on
that.
mr.
james
c.
lang
well,
fully
informed,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
of--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--well,
again,
fully
informed
is
a
term
that
means
they're
going
to
have
to
have
everything
in
the
world.
actually,
i
think
the
focus
is
on
a
balanced
presentation
in
the
sense--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--but
again,
we
get
back
to
the
situation
what
was
raised
earlier,
and
that
is
when
we
have
some
kind
of
misdirection
or
some
type
of
a--
mr.
james
c.
lang
--certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
lang
thank
you.
