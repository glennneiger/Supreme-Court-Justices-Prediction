justice
antonin
scalia
general
starr,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you,
this
is
light
years
away
from
what
you
acknowledge
can
be
sanctioned.
suppose
a
prosecutor
reads
a
document
or
a
deposition
to
the
grand
jury
and
just
leaves
out
those
passages
that
render
innocuous
what
otherwise
seems
quite
incriminating.
now,
is
that...
would
that
be
something
that
courts
could
intervene
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
so
suppose
the
prosecutor
puts
on
testimony
of
eye
witnesses
who
say
they
saw
this
person,
but
he
knows
that
the
person
has
an
iron-clad
alibi,
iron
clad,
and
he
does
not
present
that
to
the
grand
jury.
is
that
really
any
difference...
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
its
effect
from
failing
to
read
the
totality
of
the
document?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it
may
be
a
line.
it's
certainly
not
a
light
year.
it
looks
pretty
close
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lang,
what
do
you
mean,
presented
to
the
grand
jury?
what
if...
would
it
have
satisfied
you
if
the
government
had
just
walked
in
and
dumped
these
five
volumes
before
the
grand
jury
and
said,
here
it
all
is.
it's
all
there.
has
it
fulfilled
its
obligation
to
present
the
exculpatory
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
one
of
the
difficulties
in
evaluating
what
you're
asking
courts
to
evaluate
all
the
time.
it's
not
just
whether
the
evidence
is
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
depending
on
what
your
answer
is.
if
you
say
it's
okay,
then
it's
easy,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
government
has
to
go
through
those
boxes
and
the
court's
going
to
have
to
evaluate
the
quality
of
the
government's
investigation
and
presentation
of
the
consequences
of
that
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
concerned
about
a
general
rule.
i'm
not
concerned
about
this
case.
i'm
concerned
about
the
rule
you're
asking
us
to
adopt.
what
do
we
do
in
the
situation
where
there
are
50
boxes
and
you
say
we
would
have
to
evaluate
whether
the
government
did
a
good
job
of
examining
those
50
boxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
that's
probably
right.
i
think
that's
probably
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
just
saying
once
it
finds;
you're
saying
after
it
finds,
as
it
is
obliged
to
do.
i
mean,
you're
saying
the
government
has
to
go
through
these
50
boxes,
i
presume...
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
government
has
the
50
boxes.
you're
saying
in
addition,
the
government
has
some
responsibility
to
go
through
those
50
boxes
and
extract
the
exculpatory
evidence
so
that
it
could
present
them
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
be
fully
informed.
you
say
that
the
policy
is
that
they
have
to
be
fully
informed.
i
take
it...
as
i
understood
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
earlier,
you
would
not
argue
that
an
indictment
could
be
set
aside
if
the
prosecutor
came
in
with
the
exculpatory...
after
producing
considerable
incriminating
evidence,
overwhelming,
he
then
comes
in
with
some
exculpatory
evidence,
but
the
form
that
the
grand
jury
discussing
it
with
the
other
members
says
never
mind,
we've
heard
enough,
don't
waste
our
time;
we
don't
want
to
hear...
this
incriminating
evidence
is
so
condemning
that
we've
heard
enough.
that's
okay,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they've
turned
it
down.
he
tries
to
give
it
to
them,
they
say,
no,
we've
heard
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
this
fellow
should
be
tried.
take
it
to
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
really
no
rule
that
the
grand
jury
has
to
be
fully
informed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
arguing
for
a
narrower
rule
that
to
the
extent
the
prosecutor
can
assist
in
fully
informing
them,
he
must,
even
though
they
may
themselves
choose
not
to
be
fully
informed.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
even
have
to
be
balanced
informed
if
they
don't
want
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
misdirection.
they
just
don't
want
to
be
balanced
informed.
the
court
would
not
set
that
aside
because
it
had
a
grand
jury
said
we've
heard
enough
on
one
side,
we
don't
want
to
hear
the
other
side.
would
a
court
set
that
aside?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
starr,
has
the
statute
run
in
this
case?
if
we
affirm
the
court
below,
does
the
prosecution
still--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit.
respondent
john
williams,
jr.
was
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
on
seven
counts
of
knowingly
making
a
false
statement
or
report
in
violation
of
18
united
states
code
section
1014.
on
williams'
motion
the
district
court
ordered
the
indictment
dismissed
without
prejudice
because
the
government
had
failed
to
fulfill
its
obligation
under
recent
tenth
circuit
precedent
to
present
substantial
exculpatory
evidence
that
was
in
its
possession
to
the
grand
jury.
following
that
tenth
circuit
precedent,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
and
remand
the
cause
for
further
proceedings.
a
district
court
may
not
dismiss
an
otherwise
valid
indictment
because
the
government
failed
to
disclose
to
the
grand
jury
exculpatory
evidence
in
its
possession.
the
tenth
circuit's
disclosure
rule
is
not
supported
by
the
court's
inherent
supervisory
power
to
formulate
procedural
rules.
this
court's
case
is
invoking
that
power
yield
with
the
court's
control
over
their
own
procedures
whereas,
the
grand
jury
is
an
institution
separate
from
the
courts
over
whose
proceedings
the
courts
do
not
preside.
any
power
federal
courts
may
have
to
fashion
on
their
own
initiative,
rules
of
grand
jury
procedure
is
very
limited
and
certainly
would
not
permit
the
reshaping
of
the
grand
jury
institution
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
the
tenth
circuit's
rules
here.
contrary
to
williams'
suggestion,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
would
neither
preserve
nor
enhance
the
traditional
functioning
of
the
grand
jury
that
the
common
law
of
the
fifth
amendment
demands.
requiring
the
prosecutor
to
present
exculpatory
as
well
as
incriminating
evidence
would
alter
the
grand
jury's
historical
role
transforming
it
from
an
accusatory
body
that
sits
to
assess
whether
there
is
adequate
basis
for
bringing
a
criminal
charge
into
an
adjudicatory
body
that
sits
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence.
motions
to
quash
indictments
because
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
grand
jury
have
never
been
allowed.
it
would
make
little
sense
to
abstain
from
reviewing
the
evidentiary
support
for
the
grand
jury's
judgment
while
scrutinizing
the
sufficiency
of
the
prosecutor's
presentation.
congress
is
assuredly
free
to
prescribe
a
rule
requiring
the
prosecutor
to
present
exculpatory
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
but
we
conclude
that
the
federal
courts
have
no
authority
to
prescribe
such
a
duty
pursuant
to
their
inherent
supervisory
authority
over
their
own
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined,
and
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
in
part.
