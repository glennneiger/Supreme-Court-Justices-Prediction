justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr....
general
starr,
do
you
take
the
position
that
never
would
it
be
appropriate
for
a
federal
district
court
judge,
as
a
matter
of
exercise
of
supervisory
power
over
the
courts,
to
dismiss
without
prejudice
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
glaring
failure
of
the
government
to
present
some
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
that
would
have
a
direct
bearing
on
whether
the
suspect
is
indeed
appropriately
charged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
the
prosecutor
offered
known
false
testimony
to
the
grand
jury,
do
you
think
the
court
then
can,
in
the
exercise
and
supervisory
power,
dismiss?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
situation
of
the
failure
to
come
forward
with
the
iron-clad
alibi?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it's
politically
motivated
or
something
in
terms
of
timing:
have
somebody
charged
with
something.
is
there
a
remedy
there
in
the
court's
supervisory
power
for
that
sort
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lang,
what
is
the
source
of
the
rule
that
you
would
have
the
courts
follow,
the
rule
that
would
require
a
federal
court
to
review
this
and
impose
some
sanction?
is
it
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court,
or
do
you
look
to
some
constitutional
requirement.
and
if
so,
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
tenth
circuit
make
clear
that
was
what
it
was
relying
on,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
what
you
think
the
district
court
relied
on?
