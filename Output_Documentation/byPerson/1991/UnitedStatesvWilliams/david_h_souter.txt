justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
lang,
is
that...
the
touchstone
is
substantial
to
be
defined
in
terms
of
the
grand
jury
function
or
the
petty
jury
function?
in
other
words,
is
substantial
evidence
any
evidence
upon
which
a
reasonable
grand
jury
might
conclude
that
they
would
not
indict,
or
is
it
some
such
standard
as
any...
as
evidence
upon
which
a
reasonable
petty
jury
might
find
reasonable
doubt?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
is
what
is
substantial
evidence.
how
do
you
define
substantial?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
is
your
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
petty
jury
standard.
i
mean,
it
looks
to
the
trial
jury's
function
in
determining
what
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
is
that
the
rule,
the
definition,
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
for
all
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
key
it
to
the
grand
jury's
responsibility
rather
than
to
the
trial
jury's
responsibility?
why
don't
you
define
substantiality
in
terms
of
what
you
would
posit
a
reasonable
grand
jury
would
find
as
a
basis
in
the
totality
of
the
evidence
not
to
indict?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
define
substantiality
in
terms
of
what
a
reasonable
grand
jury
would
do,
if
we
could
figure
out
what
that
is,
as
opposed
to
what
a
reasonable
trial
jury
would
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
implies
a
fairly
radical
transformation
of
the
grand
jury's
function,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
on
your
theory
that
will
no
longer
be
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
anything
can
be
before
it.
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
can
throw
in
anything
he
wants
to,
and
the
grand
jury
can
call
for
anything
it
wants
to.
