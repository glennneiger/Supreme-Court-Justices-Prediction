mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
very
narrow
issue;
may
states
equate
speech
or
association
entitled
to
protection
under
the
first
amendment
with
character
evidence,
and
thereby
enhance
a
criminal
sentence,
particularly
so
as
to
impose
a
sentence
of
death,
when
those
beliefs
are
unrelated
to
the
offense.
as
delaware
concedes
in
its
brief,
the
petitioner,
david
dawson,
invokes
two
traditional
first
amendment
precepts.
first,
that
criminal
penalties
can
never
be
imposed
nor
aggravated
because
of
an
individual's
beliefs;
and
secondly,
that
government,
here
in
the
form
of
the
sentencing
jury,
must
always
remain
value
or
content
neutral
within
the
realm
of
a
person's
beliefs
or
views.
delaware
concedes
that
while
it
could
not
have
made
constitutionally
protected
belief
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
it
instead
argues
the
radical
proposition
that
the
traditional
first
amendment
constraints
against
governmental-viewpoint
punishment
are
not
applicable
to
the
highly-discretionary,
weighing
stage
of
a
death
penalty
proceeding
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
particular...
particular
defendant
should
live
or
die.
this
court,
however,
has
made
it
clear
that
states,
in
inflicting
punishment...
particularly
in
inflicting
the
penalty
of
death...
may
not
attach
the
aggravating
label
to
factors
that
are
constitutionally
impermissible.
delaware
has
done
just
that
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
passage,
however,
i
was
referring
to
is
the
court's
principle
as
stated
in
zant
v.
stevens,
which
was
a
death
penalty
case.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
no,
sir,
not
with
respect
to
this
claim.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
under
that
circumstance,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
state
could
use
that
as
an
aggravating
factor.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
it
is.
there
is
a
broad...
the
petitioner
is
stating
a
broad
proposition.
however,
there
are
narrow
circumstances
which
this
court
has
recognized
where
limited
use
of
a
belief
or
association
may
be
used
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
penalty
of
death
or
life
imprisonment
is
appropriate.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
is
a
first
amendment
inquiry,
your
honor.
however,
subsumed
within
that,
or,
more
or
less
the
overarching
consideration
is...
but
more
particularly
subsumed
within
that
claim
is
the
due
process
claim
simply
because
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
to
individuals
within
our
society
who
are
protected
by...
say
the
first
amendment...
to
say
to
them
that,
well,
you...
the
government
may
not
abridge
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
says,
however,
you're
going
to
be
punished
in
this
instance.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
relevance.
evidence
which
is
arguably
relevant
may
nonetheless
be
barred
by
some
constitutional
prohibition.
i
would
offer
the
court
as
an
example
an
instance
in
perhaps
a...
in
a
capital
proceeding
where
the
defendant
had
asserted
his
right
to
remain
silent,
had
asserted
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent
throughout
the
trial,
as
in
throughout
the
penalty
proceeding.
although
lack
of
remorse
is
a
criteria,
is
a
relevant
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
person
should
live
or
die,
if
the
state,
nonetheless,
argued
to
the
jury
under
those
circumstances
that
an
additional
reason,
or
the
very
reason
you
should
put
this
man
to
death
is
because
you
have
not
heard
him
apologize
to
you
or
anyone
else...
although
the
lack
of
remorse
is
relevant,
nonetheless,
that
would
be
barred
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
can...
all
sorts
of
evidence
can
reflect
on
character.
but
then
nonetheless,
in
any
circumstance,
where
a
person's
beliefs
are
used
to
impose
punishment,
that
is...
that
is
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment.
and
there
are
only
certain
limited
circumstances
in
which
any
evidence
can
come
into
evidence,
and
only
then
for
limited
purposes.
and,
in
fact,
in
some
of
those
instances,
the
trial
courts
or
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
trial
courts
have,
in
fact,
instructed
juries
as
to
that
limited
purpose.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
well,
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
it's
not...
there'd
be
no
first
amendment
protection
that
would
be
relevant
that
determines
his
propensity
as
to
future
conduct.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
well,
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
relevant,
because
his
belief
took
that
belief
out
of
the
context
of
first
amendment
protection,
because
the
belief
resulted
in
unlawful
action,
or
a
crime.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor,
very
much
so.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
because
there's
no--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--if
he
has
a
belief--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--if
it's--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--it
does
make
sense
in
the
sense
he's
not
being
punished
for
his
belief.
it's
merely
being
used,
let's
say,
to
evaluate
his
credibility
as
to
other
evidence
which
he
might
offered.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
under
those
circumstances...
because
it's
not
an
abstract
idea,
it's
not...
it's
an
abstraction.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with...
it's
with
abstraction,
but
perhaps
relationship
with
others.
it's
punishable,
for
that
reason,
too...
not
as
an
abstract
idea,
because
he
endorses
or
embraces
that
abstract
idea.
it's
because
he
has
not...
he
has
not
offered
his
mother
any--
if
that
is,
in
fact,
so,
if
he
has
not
offered
his
mother
any
support,
he
has
been
unkind
to
her--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--it's
perfectly...
it's
pertinent
to
character.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
ah--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--well,
were
it...
were
it--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--were
it
related
to
the
offense
itself,
somehow,
if
there
were...
if
there
were
a
violation
of
some
obligation,
if
it
was
the
death
of
his
child,
or
his
stepchild,
or
wherever...
whatever,
it
would
provide
some
insight
into
his
state
of
mind
with
respect
to
that
offense.
but
he
could
not
be
punished
for
his
belief
with
respect
to
his
mother,
because
that,
you
know,
is
unrelated
to
the
offense.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
i
do
not
think
evidence
of
that
nature
is...
as
such,
is
the
abstraction,
or
whatever,
of...
he's
not
being
punished
for
the
idea
itself.
it
shows
what...
how
it
might
relate
as
to
the
offense
having
been
committed.
for
instance,
if
it...
well,
if
it
were
in
respect
to
a
totally
unrelated
offense,
i
would
say
it's
not...
i'd
simply
say
there's
no
first
amendment
protection
under
those
circumstances.
and
arguably,
it's
not
even
relevant.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
it
is
about
beliefs.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
is
about
beliefs,
because
the
evidence
concerned
his
racist
beliefs.
and
the
jury
was
asked--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--an
association
is
not
punishable,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
there
was
no
evidence
besides
that.
and
that--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--yes,
sir,
his
membership
in
a
gang,
which--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--that
is...
that
is
correct.
and
that
the
gang
embraced
what
most
people
in
society
consider
abhorrent
beliefs,
unpopular
beliefs.
and
that
was
used
as
the
criteria--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--no,
sir,
they
are
not,
if
the
association...
if
through
the
association
it's
evident
that
the...
the
person
is
inciting
or
attempting
to
provoke
unlawful
action
as
a
result
of
that
association,
that...
that
is
not
impermeable.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
well,
with
respect
to
that,
all
the
state
was
willing
to
prove,
in
addition...
and
they
were
satisfied
with
what
they
did
prove,
but
what
they
offered,
or
proffered,
rather,
is
evidence
of
other
persons'
beliefs
or
gangs
in
other
states.
nonetheless,
it
was
not
pertinent
to
this
defendant's.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
never
went
to
the
jury.
and
that,
in
and
of
itself,
would
have
been...
would
have
been
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
was
not
characterized
as
advocating
any
particular
action.
if,
in
fact,
it
was
characterized
as
advocating
any
particular
unlawful
action,
it
would
be--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--a
propensity
is
not
enough,
your
honor.
it
must
be
shown,
or
there
must
be
a
foundation
for
distinguishing...
distinguishing
between
the
belief
in
abstract
doctrine
and
the
advocacy
of
unlawful
action.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
based
on
decisions
by
the
court
in,
for
instance,
yates
and,
and
noto,
it
would
be
along
the
lines
to
the
effect
where
the
belief,
or
where
there
is
advocacy
of
unlawful
action,
is
based
on
these
facts.
there
it
takes
it
out
of
the
realm
of
protection
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
that--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--that
is
true.
and
under
the
circumstances--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--any
belief
would
qualify
for
protection,
so
long
as
it
is
advocacy
of
an
abstract
doctrine
and
does
not
incite
or
there's
no
attempt
to
incite
unlawful
action,
or
provoke
it.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
that
is
true.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
if
this
defendant--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--that
would
be
the
criteria,
so
long
as
there
is
advocacy
to
commit
unlawful
action.
if
it
was
simply
an
abstract
doctrine...
and
i
point
out--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--under
those
circumstances
it
would
not
be.
for
instance,
where
there's
evidence
that
he
had
advocated
the
death
of
a
witness
against
him
within
the
prison,
he
had
solicited
a
crime,
unquestionably.
that
advocacy
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
any
arguable
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
yes,
sir...
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
no,
i
believe
i'm
saying
it's
the
advocacy
to
commit
this
crime,
with
the
intent
that
the
crime
be
accomplished.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
if
it
is
simply...
merely
opposition
to
an
abstract
idea,
or
to
a
principle...
let's
say
the
principles
reflected
in
the
thirteenth,
and
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments...
that's
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine.
and
that's
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
no,
i
believe
that
i--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
to
the
extent
that
i
suggested
that
advocacy
didn't
intend
that
those
ends
be
accomplished,
and
they
were
likely
to
be
accomplished,
i
may
have
misspoke.
there
has
to
be
some...
we
must
cross
the
line
of
just
advocacy
of
an
abstract
doctrine
to
take
it
outside
the
first...
the
realm
of
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
that
is,
in
fact,
correct...
that
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
association,
and
an
association
with
others
who
embrace
beliefs,
beliefs
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
as
odious
as
those
beliefs
might
be.
but
there's
no--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--the
stipulation
said
that.
however,
there
was
some
evidence
introduced
to
the
effect
that
there
was
an
association...
circumstantial
evidence
of
an
association.
the
state
introduced
a
tattoo,
and
argued
that
was
therefore
associated
with
the
gangs.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
no.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
that
is...
that
could
well
be
so.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
he
did,
your
honor.
and
he
argued
strenuously
to
the
jury
to
please
do
not
consider
this,
because
this
is
simply
a
first
amendment
belief
protected
by
the
constitution.
and
no--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--no,
sir,
he
didn't.
he
asked
the
jury
to
please
consider
that
this
is
merely
a
belief
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
no
counselor,
no
defense
counsel
in
our
states
should
be
put
in
that
position,
to
have
to
plead
to
a
jury
to
not
punish
his
client
because
of
beliefs
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
is--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--it
is...
it
is
still
an
association.
and
those
connotations,
which
just
involve
speculation
as
to
activities
where
there's
no
proof
of
the
illegal
activities,
or
proof
that
he
acted
or
carried
out
unlawful
acts
pursuant
to
membership
in
a
gang,
simply
because
of
his
association--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--well--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--your
honor,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
lanzetta
v.
new
jersey,
some
years
ago...
in
fact,
it
was
1928...
in
that
case,
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
was
that
the
petitioner
be
a
member
of
a
gang,
or
a
gangster;
in
fact,
that's
how
the
crime
was
defined.
some
of
the
other
elements
were
that
he
not
have
a
job,
that
he
associate
with
other
people.
but
basically,
the
criteria
used
was
the
connotations
behind
the
word
gangster.
and
that
was
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
i
do
not...
i
do
not
think
that
was
clear.
even
if
they
had
been,
unless
it
was...
unless
there
was
proof
that
it
was
one
of
the...
that
that
was
the
reason
for
the
gang
or
the
beliefs
were
the
reason
which
prompted
the
unlawful
activity,
the
escape,
it
would
still
be
inadmissible.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
state
did
offer,
as
aggravating--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--if
there
was...
if
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
break
out,
yes.
but
if
he
was--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--if
i...
if
i
may
make
the
distinction...
if
there
is
a
conspiracy
to
break
out,
yes.
however,
if
the...
if
the
evidence
was
only
directed
towards
the
gang
being
racist,
that's
not
punishable.
that
he...
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
that
there
was
a
conspiracy,
or
a
solicitation,
or
a
provocation--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--it
did
not
whatsoever.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
was.
and
it
was
only
admissible...
it
was
only
admitted
for
one
purpose,
so
that
the
jury
could
argue
that
as
an
additional
aggravating
circumstance,
that
he's
a
member
of
this
racist
gang.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
if
that
were
reflected
to...
if
that
reflected
his
criminal
record,
and
certainly
there
are,
perhaps,
less
prejudicial
ways
of
proving
it,
that
may
be
admissible.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
if
i
may,
allow
me
to
respond
to
the
state's
points
concerning
this
being
rebuttal
evidence.
this
is
not
rebuttal
evidence
which
we're
talking
about.
the
state
suggests
that
it
counters
what
the
defendant
proffered,
what
the
petitioner
proffered.
the
state
used
a
very
inept
example.
the
pointed
out
that
the
defendant
asked
the
court
to
consider,
asked
the
jury
to
consider
as
an
example
his
alcoholism.
now
the
state
suggests
that
somehow
evidence
concerning
his
racism
countered
or
rebutted
that
mitigating
evidence.
if
delaware
or
mr.
fairbanks
knows
of
a
rational
relationship
between
alcoholism
and
racism,
or
any
other
ism
in
this
country,
they
should
share
that
finding
with
the
surgeon
general,
as
well
as
with
delaware
juries.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
well,
unless
he
adopted
and
advocated
the
escapes.
and
i
might
point
out
that--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--unless
he
advocated,
or
if
part
of
it
was
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
escapes--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--no,
no
it
is
not.
because
there's
no
evidence
that
he
intended
to
accomplish
those
ends.
the
state,
i
may
point
out,
introduced
evidence
in
this
case
that
he
escaped.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
your
honor,
it
was
shown
in
this
case
that
he
escaped.
what
his
white
racism
had
to
do
with
it
has
nothing
to
do
with--
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
--yes.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
no,
it
does
not,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
it
is
not
just
because
belonging
to
aa
is
not
a
belief,
and
the
judge
is
not
exhorting
him
to
inflict
punishment
because
he
does
not
belong
to
aa.
mr.
bernard
j.
o'donnell
they
are
beliefs,
yes.
however,
they're
not
punishment.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
