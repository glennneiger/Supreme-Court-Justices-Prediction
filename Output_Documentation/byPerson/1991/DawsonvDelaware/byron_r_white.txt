justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
this
case
really
involve
something
about
beliefs?
i
thought
it
was
just
membership
in
a
certain
gang.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
was
just...
it
was
just
that
he
was
a
member
of
a...
of
a
prison
gang
that
was
racist.
isn't
that
all
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'd
hope
so,
but
it
isn't...
but
this
isn't
technically
beliefs.
there
wasn't
any
evidence
about
what
the
gang's
beliefs
were,
except
for
being
racial.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
just
his
membership?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
evidence
about
what
his
connection
with
the
gang
was,
other
than
membership?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
associational
rights
aren't
impervious
too,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
direct
evidence
or
stipulation
about
what
his
own
beliefs
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
he
might
have
joined
these
gangs
as
a
matter
of
self-protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
or...
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
trial
counsel
was
perfectly
free
to
argue
to
the
jury
the...
the
weight
of
this
evidence,
even
if
it
was
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
he
went
on
and
argued,
and
furthermore,
it
isn't
worth
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
jury
doesn't
elicit
this
information.
the
state
presents
it.
the
state
offers
and
argues
that
it's
a
quite
a
relevant
circumstance
to
determine
whether
this
fellow's
worth
living
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it,
under
some
circumstances,
you
would
say
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
put
in
evidence
that
although
he
belongs
to
the
boy
scouts,
he's
an
atheist?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
supposing
the
defendant
doesn't
put
in
any
of
this
evidence,
but
the
state
thinks
that...
the
state
thinks
that
in
this...
in
this
particular
county,
evidence
that
he's
a
catholic
would
be
very
unpopular
with
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
no
reasonable
juror
could
think
that
he
was
a
bad
person
for
that
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
position
is,
wholly
aside
from
that
stipulation,
you
should
be
able
to
introduce
this
evidence
as
relevant
to
character?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
state
really
offer
to
prove
that
the...
that
this
prison
gang
was
the
kind
of
a
gang
described
in
barclay
or
in,
what
is
it,
abel?
abel...
that
it's...
the
aryan
brotherhood
is
a
secret
prison
gang
that
required
its
members
always
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
organization,
to
commit
perjury,
theft,
and
murder?
did
the
state
offer
to
characterize
the
aryan
brotherhood,
and
was
that
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
he
say
the
witnesses
were
going
to
testify
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
was
going
to
say
what
the
aryan
brotherhood
was
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
if
that
evidence
had
gotten
in...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
he
thought
that
maybe
if
that
had
been
admitted,
it
would
have...
it
should
be
upheld,
that
kind
of
evidence.
do
you
understand
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
state
really
got
in
trouble
by
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
you
on
your
direct
argument
that
you
thought
that
if
there
was...
if
the
judge...
if
there
was
evidence
offered
about
the...
what
this
group
was
all
about,
that
it
really...
it
really
was
a...
a
criminal
enterprise,
and
did
incite
escapes,
would
that
evidence
be
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
say
that
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the...
all
that
was
offered
was
that
he's
a
member
of
this
group,
and
this
group
believes
and
is
actively
engaged
in
the...
in
criminal
activities.
now,
is
that
evidence
admissible?
is
his
membership
in
that
kind
of
a
group--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you
have
to
really...
you
have
to
really
show
that
he
participated
in
these
criminal
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
answer
my
question.
that's
all
i
needed
to...
all
you
need
to
do.
you
say
that
in
order
to
get
the
evidence
in,
you
would
have
to
show
that
he
participated
in
these
criminal
activities?
justice
byron
r.
white
um-hum.
