justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
do
you
say
particularly
with
respect
to
the
punishment
of
death?
i
mean
i
assume
that
if
your
proposition
is
correct,
it
would
have
to
be
correct
with
respect
to
any
sentencing.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
first
amendment
violation,
you
wouldn't
say
that
you
can,
you
know,
that
it's
good
for
other
punishments,
for
life
imprisonment,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
relying
on
death
as
different
here?
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about...
what
about
in
the
probation
report
it...
or
in
any
sentencing
proceeding,
evidence
is
brought
in
to
the
effect
that
this
individual
was
a
really
terrible
son?
his
mother,
you
know,
has
never
heard
from
him.
she's
living
in
poverty,
you
know,
things
of
that
sort.
can
that
be
in
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
what
if
it
said
he...
he
believes
that
mothers
should
be...
should
be
disregarded
and
allowed
to
live
in
poverty?
that
must
be
disregarded?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
the
one
is
relevant
to
what
sentence
he
should
get,
it
seems
to
me
the
other
is
relevant
to
what
sentence
he
should
get.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
fact
that
he
left
his
mother
to
live
in
poverty
is
only
important
because
it
shows
that
he's
the
kind
of
a
guy
who
believes
it's
okay
to
leave
your
mother
to
live
in
poverty.
but
if
he
says
that
directly,
we
can't
use
it.
that
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's
not
at
all.
it's
being
used
to
show
that
this
is
a
pretty
bad
person.
and
i'm
sure
there
are...
there
are
things
like
that
in
probation
reports.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
shows
his
character?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
he
said,
i
don't
have
a
mother,
but
by
god,
if
i
had
one,
i'll
tell
you,
i'd
let
her
live
in
poverty
and
starve
to
death?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
does
not
show
his
character?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
punishing
him
for
that
belief.
i'm
punishing
him
because
on
the
basis
of
everything
i
know
about
him,
he
is
a
bad
character.
that
is
one
of
a
whole
mosaic
of
things
that
just
comes
out
with
a
picture
of
a
bad
character.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
limit
it
that
way,
though,
you're
really
not
describing
a
doctrine
that
tracks
the
doctrine
of
the
first
amendment.
because
as
you've
just
described
it,
you
could
put
before
the
jury
the
fact
that
this
person
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
advocates
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
to
be
sure,
for
the
first
amendment,
you
can't
put
somebody
in
jail
for
doing
that.
because
advocacy
is
not
enough.
there
has
to
be
incitement,
or...
but
as
you've
described
it,
you
don't
need
the
incitement,
you
just
need
advocacy
of
something
that's
unlawful.
it
certainly
is
unlawful
violently
to
overthrow
the
u.s.
government.
so
you
could
be...
put
before
the
jury,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
this
is
a
bad
person.
he
advocates,
right?
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
o'donnell,
i
hate
to
ask
this
because
it...
you
know,
if
you
give
the
wrong
answer,
this
case
isn't
very
important.
but
it
just
doesn't
say
he's
a
member
of
a
group.
it
says...
the
stipulation
was
he's
a
member
of
a
prison
gang.
doesn't
that
have
a
connotation
of
a
group
of
people
that
engage
in
unlawful
activities,
for
starters?
i
mean,
you
don't
refer
to,
you
know,
he's
a
member
of
a
gang
called
the
kiwanis
club.
[laughter]
or
a
gang
called
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
he's
a
member
of
a
prison
gang.
what
does
that
suggest
to
you?
it
suggests
a
bunch
of
people
that
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
are
doing
not
nice
things
in
the
prison,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence...
this
that
the
jury
can't
take
it
into
account
even
if
it
is
proven...
that,
that...
you
know,
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
prison
gang.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can't
consider
it
a
sign
of
a
bad
character,
that
you're
a
member
of
a
prison
gang,
whatever
they
believe,
whether
it's
a
white
aryan
gang
or
any
other
gang.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--a
violent
overthrow
is
at
least
a
crime.
racial
attitudes,
you're...
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
not
unlawful,
short
of
taking
some
unlawful
action,
to
hate
catholics
or
to
hate...
to
hate
any
group,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
makes
you
a
bad
guy,
and
therefore
your
sentence
can
be
increased?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
were
on
a
line
of
hypothetical
questioning
whether
you
could
introduce
the
fact
that
the
person
was
a
racist,
independent
of...
let's
not
retreat
back
to
the
fact
that
he's
in
a
gang.
that's
a
different
issue.
we're
just
talking
about
the
fact
that
the
person
is
a
racist.
you
think
that
alone
should
be
able
to
be
introduced,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
if
he's
sexist?
i
suppose
that
could
be
introduced
as
well,
if
a
person
is
sexist,
or
has
a
lot
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not
quite
as
bad
as
being
a
racist,
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
worry
about.
that's
exactly
what
i
worry
about.
and
once
you
say
racism
is
okay,
you
know,
what
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
tries
to
introduce
evidence
that
he's
a
good,
god-fearing
man,
goes
to
church
every
sunday...
you
pick
your
denomination,
i
don't
care.
can
he
get
that
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
jury
can
say,
gee,
this
is
a
good,
god-fearing
man,
so
we'll
let
him
live.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
you
couldn't
produce
evidence
that
he's
not
a
good
god-fearing
man,
that
he's
an
atheist?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
the
one
does
and
the
other
doesn't.
and
what
about
the
fellow
who's
not
a
good
god-fearing
man?
i
mean
he
says,
gee,
if
i
were
only
a
good
god-fearing
man,
i
could
get
this
evidence
in
and
maybe
i
wouldn't
get
the
death
penalty.
aren't
you
punishing
because
of
his
beliefs?
you'd
be
punishing
him,
in
effect,
because
he's
not
a
good
god-fearing
man.
he
cannot
honestly
say
i
go
to
church
every
sunday.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you're
going
to
keep
out
the
bad
stuff,
you
have
to
keep
out
all
the
good
stuff
too,
to
be...
because
the
bad
people
who
don't
have
it
are
being
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
they
don't
have
it.
and
therefore,
you've
got
to
keep
it
all
out.
