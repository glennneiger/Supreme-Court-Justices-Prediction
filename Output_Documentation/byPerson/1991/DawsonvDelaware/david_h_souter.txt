justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
likely
has
the
unlawful
action
got
to
be?
i
mean
you're
not
proposing
a
kind
of
clear
and
present
danger
test,
are
you?
that
if
he
is...
if,
in
this...
in
a
capital
case,
if
he
is
not
sentenced
to
death
that
he
will
engage
in
this
behavior?
are
you
arguing
simply
that
the
belief
indicates
a
propensity...
the
statement
of
belief
indicates
a
propensity
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
behavior?
is
that
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
well
what
is...
what
is
the
line-drawing
criterion?
that's...
in
effect,
that's
what
you
want
us
to
hold.
how
would
we
write
the
sentence
that
encapsulates
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's,
again...
i
think
you're
saying
that
there
need
not
be,
in
order
to
make
the
belief
evidence
admissible,
there
need
not
be
any
particular
degree
of
probability
that
that
belief
would,
in
fact,
be...
form
the
basis
for
later
action,
but
merely
a
possibility
that
it
form
a
motive
for
later
action.
is
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
doesn't
any
belief
qualify?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
not...
i
don't
think
you're
saying
that
the
kind
of
relevant
and
admissible
belief
evidence
must
consist
of
statements
of
incitement.
you're
saying,
somehow,
that
they
must
consist
of
statements
which,
if
they
were
followed
by
the
defendant,
would
entail
unlawful
conduct.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
no
incitement.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
we're
not
talking
about
statements
of
incitement.
we're
simply
talking
about
statements
of
belief.
and
what
is
the
criterion
for
judging
between
some
statements
of
belief
which
may
be
considered,
and
others
which
may
not
be?
two
possibilities
come
to
mind.
one
is,
there
must
be
some
high...
some
degree
of
probability
that
he
will
actually
act
on
the
statement.
and
i
think
you've
said
that's
not
your
criterion.
the
other
possibility
is
that
the
statement
must
be...
must
somehow
relate
to
unlawful
conduct
which
is
identical
to
or
close
to
the
conduct
for
which
he
is
being
punished
in
this
case.
would
that
be
your
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
you're
centering...
if
you're
sentencing
then,
a
burglar,
a
high
degree
of
probability
based
even
on
advocacy,
even
on
statements
of
advocacy
of
murder
would
be
irrelevant?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
when
he's
being
sentenced
for
burglary?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
aren't
you
saying
that
advocacy
of
any
crime
will
satisfy
your
test?
but
if
the
behavior
is
noncriminal,
it's
got
to
satisfy
some
further
relevance
test...
if
the
belief
is
of
noncriminal
behavior
it's
got
to
satisfy
a
different
relevance
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
equally
true,
then,
that
you
could
put
in
evidence
that
he's
a
socialist?
socialists
are
at
war
with
the...
with
the
property
structure
of
the
united
states.
it's
a
minority
position,
and
you
could
say
this
man
is
a
socialist.
he's
not
a
republican
or
a
democrat.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
be
at
war
with
society...
aren't
socialists
at
war
with
the
property
structure
of
the
united
states?
