mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
david
dawson
was
sentenced
to
death
in
a
delaware
courtroom,
because
he
broke
out
of
prison,
he
broke
into
madeline
kisner's
home,
he
burglarized
it,
he
robbed
her,
he
tied
her
up,
he
strangled
her,
then
he
stabbed
her
12
times,
killing
her.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
his
membership
in
a
prison
gang,
called...
a
racist
prison
gang
called
the
aryan
brotherhood
is
reflective
of
character.
dawson
concedes
it's
reflective
of
character.
there
is
no
question--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--no,
i
did
not.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
well,
what
it
says
is
is
that
the
aryan
brotherhood
refers
to
a
racist
prison
gang,
a
white
racist
prison
gang
which
was
founded
in
california.
i
think...
and
if
the...
there's
no
quarrel
that
these
reflect
david
dawson's
beliefs.
because
in
closing
argument,
mr.
swierzbinski,
who
defended
dawson,
says
yes,
he's
a
racist.
so
that
we're
not
here
with
the
quarrel
of
whether
or
not
these
accurately
reflect...
whether
this
particular
description
of
the
aryan
brotherhood
was,
in
fact
accurate,
or
whether
it,
in
fact,
reflected
david
dawson's
views.
but
when
you
look
at
all
of
this
in
context,
you
have
to
put
in
the
context
of
the
delaware
system,
the
delaware
death
penalty
system,
which
is
a
gregg
or
georgia-type
system,
that's
announced
by
this...
referred
to
in
this
court
in
gregg
and
zant.
and
that
is,
that
first
the
defendant
is
convicted
of
first-degree
murder.
thereafter,
the
discretion
of
the
jury
is
narrowed
with
the...
with
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
finally,
the
jury
is
left
to
assess
whether
or
not
the
penalty
should
be
life
imprisonment
or
death,
based
upon
an
individualized
determination
of
david
dawson's
characteristics
and...
character
and
propensities,
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
it
shows
that
there
was
one
black
juror.
and
what
happened
in
this
case...
if
i
can
sort
of
explain
it...
there
was
voir...
voir
dire
of
the
entire
jury
panel,
individual
voir
dire,
in
which
the...
in
which
the
judge
said,
in
effect,
can
you...
there
may
be
evidence
in
this
case
about
membership
in,
or
references
to
the
aryan
brotherhood,
and
described
it
briefly.
will
this
evidence
prevent
you
from
being
fair?
that
question
was
answered
negative...
was
said...
four
individuals
who
were
selected
for
this
jury
said,
i
can't
be
fair
with
this
evidence.
they
were
excluded
for
cause.
two
others,
for
a
total
of
six,
knew
something
about
the
case.
but
what
they
knew
about
the
case
was
that
david
dawson
belonged
to
the
aryan
brotherhood.
and
they,
similarly,
were
excluded,
so
that
six
members
of
the
jury
were
excluded.
dawson
had
argued
that
you
have
to
exclude
this
up
front.
you
have
to...
his
motion
in
limine
to
be
dealt
with
up
front,
because
consistent
with
his
views,
his
racial
stereotyping,
he
believed
that
blacks
and
jews
would
be
more
on
his
side
with
regard
to
the
conviction.
and
he
wanted
them
on
the
jury.
but
if
this
evidence
was
going
to
be
presented,
he
was
going
to
exercise
his
preemptory
challenges
to
exclude
all
blacks.
and
that's
what
he
did.
he
ran
out
of
preemptory
challenges
around
juror
number
six
or
seven;
and
juror
number
eight,
i
believe
it
was,
was
the
one
black
individual
who
he
could
not
peremptorily
challenge.
so
that
there
is
just
one
black
member
of
this
jury.
but
when
you
look
at
what
the...
that
final,
discretionary
stage,
what
a
jury
is
supposed
to
do,
the
jury
is
not
to
be
value
or
content
neutral.
the
jury
is
to
exercise
moral
judgment.
and
they
are
to
exercise
moral
judgment
based
upon
the...
among
other
things,
the
character
and
propensities
of
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
it
tells
us
two
things:
one,
a
general
sense
of
lawlessness,
and
two--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--because
it's
a
prison
gang.
it's
a
racist
prison
gang.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
trial
judge
thought,
and
actually
that's
what
the
supreme--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--no,
what
he
argued
goes
to
the
second
part
of
what
the
aryan
brotherhood
deals
with.
and
that
is
his
rejection
of
rehabilitation.
david
dawson
presented
evidence
in
his
case...
or
brought
out
evidence
in
the
state's
case
and
presented
evidence
in
his
case...
of
essentially
aspects
of
rehabilitation.
he
said,
look,
in
my
years
of
prison,
i
have
gone
to
aa,
i
belong
to
other
treatment
programs.
these
were
signs
and
were
admissible
because
they
showed
that
he
had
tried
to
rehabilitate
himself
to
bring
him
back
into
society.
this
evidence
counters
that.
this
evidence
is
that
he
rejects...
that
the
real
david
dawson
is
not
the
person
that
goes
once
a
week
or
so
to
an
aa
meeting,
but
the
real
david
dawson
who
was
24
hours
a
day,
in
the
full
year,
a
member
of
the
gang.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--well,
the
stipulation
is
something
that
dawson
agreed
to,
and
it
is
subsumed
within
the
notion
of
a
white
racist
prison
gang.
and
i
really
think
that's--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--well,
but
i--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--well,
he
agrees
that
he
is
a
racist.
i
mean
his
closing
argument
says
yes,
this
is
accurate.
this
accurately
reflects
my
views.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--it
was,
it
was
sequential.
there
is...
there
is
the
prosecutor's
argument,
his
closing
argument,
and
then
final
rebuttal.
but
i
think
that...
that
the
point
really
is
is
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
does
this
accurately
reflect.
does
the...
does
what
we
have
said
about
him
accurately
reflect
david
dawson?
and
there's
no
argument
that
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
he
agrees
that
it
does.
so
we're
not
here--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--well,
i'm
not
sure
how
you
determine
how
he
votes,
given
secrecy
of
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--i
think
that
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
not
dawson's
per
se
rule,
which
simply
works
on
the
syllogism
of
if
he
can
attach
a
speech
or
association
element,
it's
excluded.
rather,
what
you
look
at
is
what
does
it
say
about
a...
what
characteristic
does
it
say
about
him,
and
is
that
characteristic
relevant?
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i
think
if
it
speaks
to
a
characteristic
that
is--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--then
it's
relevant.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
and
i
think
it
does
speak
to
a
characteristic
that
is
relevant
to...
to
sentencing.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
he
is...
he
is
fundamentally
at
war
with
his
society.
and
he
rejects
the
values
of
the
society.
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
because
it
says
something
very
specific
about
his
character,
his
rejection
of--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--i
think
it
says...
it
says
that
he...
is
that
he
judges
people
not
on
the
basis
of
who
they
are,
but
based
on
the
basis
of
race.
he
is,
in
effect...
racism
is
the
ultimate
dehumanization
of
individuals.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
if
he
has...
i
think
that
religious
or
other
prejudices,
they
are
available,
too.
but
that's
not
this
case.
what
this
case
is--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--but
that's
not...
well...
it
is
part
of
his
character
that
is
not
acceptable.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
go
that
far.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
because
i'm
not
sure
that--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--i
don't
think
in
the
same...
in
the
same
sense
that
racism
is.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i
would
think
that
if
it
speaks
to
a
relevant
criteria
in
sentencing--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--and
i
think
that
the
violent
overthrow
of
his
society
speaks
to
a
relevant
sentencing
trait.
it
is
much
like...
like
remorse,
or
the
lack
of
remorse,
which
he
would
also
reject
in
his
analysis.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
that's
true,
as--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--but
here,
it
wasn't
just
the
beliefs
in
a
vacuum.
it
was
associated
with
a
prison
gang.
and
i
think
that
this
case
is...
is
looked
at
in
two
ways.
one--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
a
matter
which
is
not,
per
se,
excluded.
that
at
that
point,
the
judge
must
weigh
and
balance
probative
value
versus
risk
of
prejudice.
and
the
judge
may
very
well,
and
probably
will,
in
most
of
those
instances,
exclude
it
after
that
weighing
process.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you...
you
get
to
that
weighing
process,
that
you
don't
have
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
how
broad
sexist
is
defined.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
what
i'm
saying
is,
is
that
you
don't
have
the
judges
picking
and
choosing
between
what
is
good
and
bad
character
before--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--no,
what
i'm
saying
is
there
is
not
a
per
se...
a
per
se
rule
which
excludes
all
of
this.
because
what
he
says,
he
wants
to
wrap
himself
in
the
first
amendment,
but
he
doesn't
really
want
to
wrap
himself
in
the
first
amendment.
the
gown
doesn't
really
fit.
what
he's...
because
the
premise
of
the
first
amendment
is
not
you
can't
consider
it
against
you.
it
is
neutrality.
the
premise
of
the
first
amendment
is
that
government
needs
to
be
neutral.
and
here,
the
structure
of
the
legislative
scheme
is
itself
neutral.
the
judge,
in
itself,
in
analyzing
this
is
neutral.
they
are
basing
it
on
characteristics.
it
is
simply...
the
statute,
itself
talks
about
character
and
propensity
of
the
defendant.
it
can
be
admitted
in
aggravation
or
mitigation.
the
judge
does
not
decide
whether
it
is
good
character
or
bad
character.
he
simply
says,
is
it
relevant
and...
to
an
important
peneological
concern,
something
that's
relevant
and
important
to
sentencing.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
no,
i'm
saying
that
it
is
relevant
to
character.
but
he...
but
he
then
goes
and
says,
what
does
that
character
trait
tell
us
about
this
individual?
one
can
conceive
of
all
sorts
of
character
traits
that
really
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
sentencing.
here,
rejection
of
rehabilitation,
which
was
now
it
was
argued,
it's
how
the
delaware
supreme
court
viewed
this
evidence,
is
relevant
to
sentencing.
and
it,
in
fact--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
because
at
that
point,
government
is
deciding
what
groups
are
good
and
what
groups
are
bad.
the
legislature
is
making
that
judgment.
they
could--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--because
the
jury...
because
the--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--well,
because
at
the...
at
the
latter
stage,
they
are
looking
at
it
not
just
as,
as
an
aggravating
circumstance.
they're
looking
at
it
in
the
full
context
of
all
the
variety
of
considerations
that
the
jury
has
to
consider.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
because
it...
i
suppose,
because
at
that
point
he
is,
he
is
made
eligible
for
death
because
of
that--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--we
think
not.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
because
we
think
that
on
that
point,
the
legislature
is
making
value
judgments.
and
that
unless
you
can
show
and
be--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--because
that's
the
jury
function
in
this
instance.
the
jury...
what
this
court
has
said
the
jury
is
to
do,
is
to
make...
is
to
make
a
moral
judgment
as
to
his
fate
based
upon
the
consideration
of
the...
of
his
characteristics.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
that's
right.
but
the
state
does
not
actually
do
the
labeling.
the
jury
does
the
labeling.
and
the
jury
does
the
labeling
in
the
full
range
of
circumstances
about
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
that
is...
that
is
similar
to
what
the
sentencing
judge
did
in
barclay.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
i
think
that
that...
membership
in
a...
in
a
racist
group
does
speak
to
a
relevant
character
trait,
and
the
judge
can
make...
take
that
into
consideration
when
he
considers
all
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
well,
because
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
context
of
death
penalty...
penalty
hearings,
is
that
what
that
jury
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
render
a
moral
judgment
based
upon
the
character
and
propensities
of
the
defendant
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
you
can't
be
content
neutral,
or
value
neutral,
and
make
moral
judgments.
so
that
they
have
to
be
free,
and
they
are
asked
to
be
free
every
day
to
make
moral
judgments.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
i
think...
and
that's...
and
that
ultimately
is
what
his...
his
final
position,
as
articulated
in
his
reply
brief
is.
and
that
is,
that
if
he
presents
membership,
associational
beliefs
in
mitigation,
the
state
can
present
associational
beliefs
in
aggravation.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
justice
white,
i
think
that...
i'm
not
sure
what...
what,
from
the...
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
what
membership
in
the
boy
scouts
says
about
somebody,
and
nor
am
i
sure
what
atheism
says
about
somebody.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
and
that
is
material
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
has
made
clear
would
not
be
admissible.
because
what
that
is--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--because
what
it
is
doing
is
interjecting
an
arbitrary
factor
to
appeal
to
prejudice
or
bias,
and
that
there
is
a
limitation
to
this.
what--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--this
court
has
held
that
that
is...
that
that
is
relevant--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
all
this
is
the
counter
to
that
sort
of
evidence.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
well,
because
it
does
not
speak
to
a...
to
a
factor
that
is...
that
is
relevant--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
is
what
occurs,
and
may
very
well
occur
in
death
penalty
cases
up
to
now...
that
is,
is
that
the
jury
has
before
them,
the
characteristics
that
the
defendant
puts
in
which
are
not
related
to
conduct,
which
are
first
amendment
material.
i
mean,
he
may
say--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--yes,
if
this
is
a
first
amendment
claim,
which
is
what
dawson
says
that
it
is,
yes.
because
the
first
amendment
is
not
designed
to
say
you
can
consider
it
all
good,
or
you
can
consider
it
all
bad.
it
is
neutrality.
if
the
jury
is
to
be
neutral,
you
can't
consider
any
of
it.
but
if
the
jury,
in
this
instance,
is...
is
the
government,
then
the
jury
must
be
neutral.
but
if
the
jury
is
neutral,
they
are
not
making
moral
judgments
based
upon
the
character
of
this
defendant.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
he
says
in
his
reply
brief
that
if
he
can
present
evidence
in
aggravation...
in
mitigation
that
are
associational
beliefs,
he's
always
conceded...
although
it's
the
first
time
in
his
reply
brief...
that
the
state
can
do
the
same
in...
to
counter
that
evidence.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
the
record
says,
is
that
immediately
before
they
left,
they
adjourned
to
enter
the
stipulation
that
he
finally
entered
into,
the
prosecutor
offered
just
such
an
arrangement.
on
joint
appendix
page
51,
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
the
prosecutor
said,
look.
you
can't
be
offering
associational
beliefs
unconnected
to...
to
conduct
and
mitigation,
and
bar
us
from
doing
it...
doing
the
counter...
doing
the
same
thing.
and
then
he
further
goes
on
to
say
that,
sure,
if
you
want
to
enter
in
this
stipulation
not
to
present
that,
that
evidence,
we'll
do
the
same.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
no,
what...
what
happened,
what
the
sequencing
of
events
were,
is
that
the
prosecutor
was...
began
with
a
proffer.
and
he
proposed,
then
to
move
on
to
present
voir
dire
testimony
of
the
state's
witnesses,
so
the
judge
could
then
undertake
a
balancing
approach,
which
is
what
he
said
is...
he...
the
judge
said,
he's
got
a
two-step
process.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
that
the...
there
were
two
main,
and
central
characteristics,
but
that
the
individual
from
the
bureau
of
federal
prisons
was
going
to
come
in,
and
he
was
going
to
be
our
expert.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
yes,
and
what
he
said
was,
is
they
have
two
main
characteristics.
the
two
main
goals
of
the
aryan
brotherhood
are...
and
this
is
at
page,
joint
appendix
page
33...
and
he
says
their
two,
main
goals
are,
one,
to
control
the
drugs
in
prison,
and
two,
violent
escape
attempts.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
violent
escape
attempts.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
it's...
he's
sometimes
hard
to
pin
down.
but
i
think
that
that's
one
of
the
things
that
he
has
said,
yes.
and
i
think
that...
that
what
happened
was,
is
that
the
parties--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--that's
right.
i
mean
what
he's
saying
is
is
he's
trying
to
have
it
both
ways.
he
wants
a
sterile
presentation
of
the
evidence.
and
then
he
wants
to
attack
us
for
having
agreed
to
a
sterile
presentation
of
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
absolutely.
that
what
the
prosecutor
also
proffered
that
the
state
would
show
was
a
letter
signed
by
dawson--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
now,
having
accepted
that
stipulation,
he
cries
foul.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
chief
justice,
what
i'm
crying
foul
is,
is
that...
is
being
attacked
for
the
stipulation.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
well,
the
proffer
actually
does
go
farther
than
that.
i
mean,
because
the
proffer
said
that
one
of
the
things
they
seized
from
his...
from
his
cell
was
a
letter
signed
by...
by
dawson,
saying
that
aryan
brothers
must
take
flight.
now,
that
is
at
joint
appendix
page
36.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
that
is...
that
connects
to
the
second
of
the
two
principal
goals
of
the
aryan
brotherhood
that
mr.
aaron
was
going
to
testify
to.
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
key
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument.
the
key
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
is
comparison
between
what
dawson
says
about
his
conduct
in
prison,
and
his
association
with
his
family,
and
what
he
really
is.
and
he
almost
invariably
connected--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--because
the
organization...
just
like
his
joining
aa,
his
going
to
aa
meetings...
i
mean
he
has
a
right
to
say
that,
not
because
he's
proven
that
he
has
actually
been
rehabilitated,
but
that
he
goes
to
those
meetings
as
offer...
as
an
offer
to
show
that
he
is
making
attempts
at
rehabilitation.
this
is
the
counter
of
that
evidence.
this
is
what
the
delaware
supreme
court
understood
that
this
evidence
was
designed
to
deal
with.
and
he
does
not
really
argue
that
that
is
improper.
he
wants
to
say
that
simply
because
the
evidence
is...
attaches
to
first
amendment
that
it
cannot
be
used
against
him,
but
it
can
be
used
for
him.
and
that,
we
say,
is
not
the
premise
of
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
is
not
the
evidentiary
rule
that
he
wishes
it
to
be.
as
this
court
said
in
barclay
and
in
abel,
both
cases
in
which
associations
were
properly
used...
in
barclay
to
sentence,
in
abel
to
convict...
that
the
associations,
if
they
are
relevant
to
a...
to
a
matter
that's
properly
before
the
jury
are
not
excluded
simply
because
they
are
associations
or
beliefs.
he
says
that's
wrong.
he
says
that
what...
that
there...
his
syllogism
is
very
simple,
that
if
he
can
identify
something
as
an
association
or
belief,
it's
excluded
as
aggravation.
and
we
say
that
is
not
what
the
first
amendment
is
designed
to
deal
with,
and
that's
not
what
this
court
has
said
that
the
jury
is
supposed
to
do
when
they
consider
death
cases.
or,
in
fact,
any
other
case,
any
sentencing
case.
because
it...
just
to
give
you
one--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--now,
well,
what
i
think
he's
saying
is
if
you
cannot
punish
it
as...
if
you
can't
criminalize
it
you
can't...
or
regulate
against
it,
is
why
you
can't
consider
it
when
you
talk
about
his
character.
and
we
simply
say
that
you
can.
it's
much
like
remorse
or
the
lack
of
remorse.
one
can
demonstrate
lack
of
remorse
not
simply
by
not
testifying,
but
actively
by
saying
something,
or
by
making
a
gesture.
clearly,
that
is
pure
speech.
that
is
something
which
talks
about
what's
inside
of
you.
that
is
relevant
to--
mr.
richard
e.
fairbanks,
jr.
--no,
i
am
saying,
and
what
the
delaware
supreme
court
said
is
two
things.
it
shows
he
is
a
bad...
has
bad
character...
he's
a
bad
character,
lawlessness;
and
two,
that
it's
a
rejection
of
rehabilitation.
both
of
those
factors
are
relevant,
much
as
the
lack
of
remorse.
