justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
o'donnell,
i
thought
there
was
an
acknowledgment
by
your
opponent
that
the
membership
in
this
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
offense
for
which
he
was
tried.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wasn't
the
evidence
of
aryan
brotherhood
membership
excluded
until
the
penalty
phase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
aren't
there
some
gangs
that
are
not
necessarily
invidious?
how
about
a
chain
gang?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
what
does...
what
does
the
membership
in
the
white
aryan
brotherhood
tell
us
about
his
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
now
how
do
you
get
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
racist
prison
gang...
you
think
the
word
gang
implies
lawlessness,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
the
argument
that
the
prosecutor
made,
that
it
implied
lawlessness?
or
did
he
just
argue
about
the
kind
of
views
he
had
with
respect
to
the
different
races?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
it
have
been
permissible
to
just
have...
you
have
the
two
first...
to
simply
put
in
evidence
that
he
was
a
white
racist,
period.
he
voted
for...
in
a
certain
way
in
an
upcoming
election,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
he
stipulated
that
he
was
going
to
vote
for
this
particular
individual
who's
a
white...
alleged
to
be
a
white
racist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
supports
white
racist
causes,
generally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
sufficient
to
put
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there
are
two
parts
to
it.
let's...
i'd
like
to
separate...
one
is
he
stipulates
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
prison
gang,
without
identifying
it,
that
it
was
formed
in
response
to
other
prison
gangs.
you...
that,
you
say,
would
be
relevant
because
it
shows
he's
not
capable
of
being
rehabilitated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
the
second
half
of
it,
and
the
one
that
was
emphasized
by
the
prosecutor,
that
he
stipulates
that
he
is
a
member
of
a
white
racist
group,
a
group
that
believes
the
white
race
is
superior
to
all
other
races,
and
for
political
and
other
purposes
he
subscribes
to
those
beliefs.
could
that
part
separately
be
put
in
evidence
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
know
what
it
speaks
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i've
told
you
exactly
what
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
just
identify
him
as
a
white
racist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
some
people...
there
are
a
lot
of
people,
unfortunately,
in
this
society
who
share
those
values.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
can
all
be...
that
can
be
a...
say
it's
not
a
capital
case,
just
say
a
sentencing
guideline
case.
your
belief
about
the
relative
values
of
the
races
can
be
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
imposes
a
more
severe
penalty
on
you
for
a
crime
you
commit
under
the
statutory
sentencing
guidelines.
that's
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
it
say
about
his
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
also
put
in,
for
example,
that
he
hates
catholics,
period;
or
he
hates
a
certain,
certain
religion.
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
what's
the
difference?
it's
basically
his
views
that
are
not
shared
by
the
majority
that
make
him
susceptible
to
more
severe
penalty,
if
i
understand
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fairbanks,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
have
not
misunderstood
your
position
on
one
point.
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
it
would
be
impermissible
to
make
membership
in
the
aryan
brotherhood
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
why
would
it
be
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it's
a
judgment
a
jury
can
make,
but
the
legislature
cannot
make.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
do
you
draw
the...
they're
both
speaking
for
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
legislature
looks
at
it
in
the
same
full
context,
and
they
just
say
this
is
always
an
aggravating
circumstance,
because
it
always
illustrates
bad
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
it
isn't
death.
say
it's
the
sentencing
guidelines,
that
you
have
a...
for
robbery,
that
you
get
an
additional
point,
or
whatever
you
do,
to
get
into
a
higher,
more
severe
poten...
eligibility
for
a
more
severe
sentence,
membership
in
the...
just
as
justice
scalia
said.
this
is
not
necessarily
just
a
death
case.
membership
in
the
aryan
brotherhood
should
be
worth
three
points,
to
move
you
from
category
a
to
category
b.
could
the
legislature
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
not?
and
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
can
the
jury
make
a
value
judgment
that's
impermissible
for
the
elected
representatives
of
the
whole
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
he
accepted
the
stipulation
as
a
substitute
for
keeping
all
this
evidence
out.
and
there's
a
pretty
good
argument
for
keeping
all
this
evidence
out.
he's
just
a
member
of
the
gang.
that's
all
that
you've
proved
so
far,
not
that
he'd
participated
in
any
of
these
activities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
aryan
brothers
must
take
flight.
and
what
does
that
prove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
neither
of
those
goals
had
anything
to
do
with
white
supremacy,
did
they?
the
two...
none
that
he
was
going
to
testify,
and
white
supremacy
is
the
key
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
his
conduct
in
prison,
and
what
he
really
is,
why
don't
you
put
in
evidence
of
what
he
did
in
prison,
instead
of
what
organization
he
belonged
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
the
syllogism
i
understood
him
to
mean...
he
said
if
you
can't
make
it
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
how
in
the
world
can
you
make
it
a
nonstatutory
aggravating
circumstance.
that's
the
syllogism
i
understand
him
to
be
advancing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
membership
in
this
organization
proves
lack
of
remorse.
that's
the
argument?
