well,
mr.
fairbanks,
are
you
assuming
that
we
take
judicial
notice
of
what
the
beliefs
are
of
members
of
the
aryan
brotherhood
chapter
in
delaware?
are
we
supposed
to
just
make
certain
assumptions
here?

because
the
stipulation
is
so
bare
bones
that
i
didn't
find
any
evidence
connecting
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
brotherhood
to
lawlessness
or
a
rejection
of
rehabilitation.
i
just...
i
didn't
see
that
in
the
stipulation.
