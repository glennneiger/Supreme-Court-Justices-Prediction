we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-6704,
david
dawson
v.
delaware.
mr.
o'donnell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--question
presented,
mr.
o'donnell,
has
the
qualification
that
the
murder
here
had
no
racial
motivations
or
connections.
you're
not
arguing,
then,
that
if
the
murder
did
have
racial
connections
or
motivations
the
state
couldn't
have
used
this
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
one
limitation,
isn't
it,
on
your
very
broad
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
a
sentencing
proceeding
in
a
noncapital
case
where
you
deal
with
a
probation
interview,
and
there
are
probation
officers
interviewing?
the
defendant
who
has
been
convicted,
but
not
yet
sentenced
says...
and
the
probation
officer
says,
are
you
sorry
for
having
done
this?
and
he
says,
no,
i'm
not
sorry.
i...
i
believe
the
guy
should
have
been
killed,
and
that's
the
way
i
feel
about
it.
i
don't
have
any
remorse
at
all.
now
that,
presumably,
is
a
belief
he
has.
but
surely
that
could
be
taken
into
consideration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
his
particular
belief
that
this
guy
should
have
been
killed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
like
your
exception
for
a
racially
motivated
crime,
and
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're--
--there
was
a
long
colloquy
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant
before
the...
was
it
the
superior
court
judge
before
whom
this
case
was
tried?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
to
just
what...
what
should
come
in
about
this
membership.
and
what
the
judge
actually
let
in
was
not
nearly
as
much,
as
i
read
it,
as
the
state
said
they
could
prove.
is
that
your
impression
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
that
never...
and
that
never
went
to
the
jury
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
went
to
the
jury
was
basically
if
they...
saying
they
could
take
into
consideration
his
membership
in
this
organization
which
had
a
particular
belief,
but
which
was
not
characterized
as
advocating
any
particular
action.
is
that
true?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
o'donnell,
i
wonder
if
your
case
shouldn't
be
aimed
more
at
membership
rather
than
advocacy?
let
me
read
to
you
the
stipulation
which,
i
understand,
is
what
went
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
the
aryan
brotherhood
refers
to
a
white
racist
prison
gang
that
began
in
the
1960's
in
california
in
response
to
other
gangs
of
racial
minorities.
separate
gangs
calling
themselves
the
aryan
brotherhood
now
exist
in
many
state
prisons,
including
delaware.
now,
it
says
nothing
about
what
this
fellow
believes.
it's
simply
talking
about
his
membership
in
a...
in
a
gang
which
is
described
as
a
white
racist
prison
gang.
i
think
you
may
be
biting
off
more
than
you
need
to
when
you
get
into
all
of
this
about
advocacy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
o'donnell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fairbanks,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now--
--well,
what
if
he...
what
if
he
either...
do
you
want
to
put
a...
because
you
want
to
put
in,
in
the
days
when
the
cold
war...
that
the
man
is
a
communist?
he
believes
in
the
overthrow,
the
ultimate
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system.
and
this
is...
this
is
a
simple
murder
case.
there
are
no
political
elements
to
it.
can
that
come
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
i've
told
you,
i've
told
you
what
the
thing
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
is
if...
if
the
defendant
at
the
sentencing
hearing
can
show
that
he
went
to
dancing
class
in
prison,
and
that's
a
mitigating
thing,
you
should
be
able
to
show
something
like
this,
maybe
some
of
the
jurors
will
think
it's...
it's
a
point
against
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
lost
something
by
that
sterile
presentation,
too.
it
lost
any
testimony
connecting
this
particular
membership
to
the
sort
of
things
that
a
lot
of
people
would
feel
were
quite
relevant
to
a
sentencing
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what...
what
difference
does
it
make
what
the
state
proffered?
the
judge
didn't
turn
down
their
proffer.
they
had...
he
was
a
most
patient
judge.
he
heard
him
for
page
after
page
on
this
question.
finally,
they
came
up
with
this
stipulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
having
accepted
the
stipulation
are
crying
foul--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'donnell.
mr.
fairbanks,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'donnell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
dispositions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
one
is
dawson
against
delaware.
after
escaping
with
three
other
inmates
from
the
delaware
correctional
center,
the
petitioner
here,
david
dawson,
murdered
mrs.
madeline
kisner
at
her
home.
police
officers
apprehended
him
early
the
next
morning
while
performing
a
house-to-house
search.
a
jury
convicted
him
of
first
degree
murder
and
other
related
crimes.
the
trial
court
then
conducted
a
penalty
hearing
before
the
jury
to
determine
whether
dawson
should
be
sentenced
to
death
for
the
murder.
at
the
penalty
hearing,
the
prosecution
introduced
evidence
that
dawson
had
tattooed
the
words
aryan
brotherhood
on
his
hand
and
also
read
to
the
jury
the
following
stipulation.
the
aryan
brotherhood
refers
to
a
white
racist
prison
gang
that
began
in
the
1960s
in
california
in
response
to
other
gangs
of
racial
minorities.
separate
gangs
calling
themselves
the
aryan
brotherhood
now
exists
in
many
state
prisons
including
delaware.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
jury
found
that
the
aggravating
evidence
against
dawson
outweighed
the
mitigating
evidence
and
made
a
binding
recommendation
that
dawson
be
sentenced
to
death,
and
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
affirmed
the
conviction
and
the
death
sentence.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
admission
of
the
evidence
regarding
dawson's
membership
in
the
aryan
brotherhood
violated
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
although
the
constitution
does
not
erect
any
automatic
barrier
to
the
admission
at
sentencing
of
evidence
concerning
one's
beliefs.
we
have
concluded
that
the
narrowness
of
the
stipulation
used
in
this
case
left
the
aryan
brotherhood
evidence
totally
without
relevance
to
dawson's
sentencing
proceeding.
as
a
result
of
its
reliance
on
the
narrow
stipulation,
the
prosecution
failed
to
prove
anything
more
than
dawson's
abstract
racist
beliefs.
we
leave
for
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
the
question
of
whether
the
first
amendment
violation
in
this
case
was
harmless
error.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
