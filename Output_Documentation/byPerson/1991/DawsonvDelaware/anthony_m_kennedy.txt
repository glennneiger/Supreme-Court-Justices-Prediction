justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
simply
a
first
amendment
argnment
you're
making?
suppose,
for
instance,
that
we
were
to
conclude
that
character,
associations,
beliefs,
are
relevant
to
a
whole
range
of
sentencing
issues.
but
that
this
particular
reference
might
be
unduly
prejudicial.
have
you
preserved
a
due
process
argument?
or
is
it
simply
a
first
amendment
inquiry
that
we're
making?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
you
disagree
with
the
comment
that
this
is
simply
a
question
of
relevance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
fifth
amendment
is
in
large
part
a
procedural
safeguard
at
trial,
for
a
systemic
reason.
but
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
this
is
just
a
question
of
relevance.
in
the
hypothetical
he
put
to
you,
yes,
the
evidence
is
relevant,
it
comes
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
don't
even
need
to
concede
that
he
belonged
to
a
gang
that
had
racist
views.
the
stipulation
says
the
california
gang
had
racist
views,
not
that
this
one
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
wasn't
this
breakout
effected
by
members
of
the
gang?
i
thought
that
the
people
that
broke
out
were
all
members
of
this
gang?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is,
is
that
if
the
gang
breaks
out
of
prison,
in
sentencing,
the
judge
can't
take
into
account
that
the...
that
the
prison
breakout
was
orchestrated
by
a
gang?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
in
this
record,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
the
stipulation
didn't
show
that
this
was
a
racist
prison
gang.
it
was
very
careful
on
that
point.
it
said
the
california
gang
is
racist.
and
the
prosecutor...
were
you
the...
did
you
prosecute
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
well
your
prosecutor
continued
to
argue
that
this
was
a
racist
gang.
and
that...
that's
not
reflected
in
the
stipulation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
record
show
that
any
minority
members
were
on
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
does
it
show
in
that
regard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
keep
saying
that,
but
it's
a
california
gang
that's
white
racist.
and
he's
a
member
of
a
delaware
gang
with
the
same
name.
that's
all
it
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
prosecutor,
just
as
you're
doing
here,
continues
to
argue
that
he's
a
racist.
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
evidence
of
that
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
his
closing
argument
after
the
argument
given
by
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
saying
it's
not
relevant
to
character?
i
thought
that
was
your
whole
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
judge
says,
in
my
moral
judgment,
members
of
the
aryan
league
are,
by
reason
of
their
beliefs,
are
more
deserving
of
the
death
penalty
than
people
that
are
not
members.
and
that's
the
dispositive
point
in
my
decision.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
and
you
would
permit
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
i
don't
see
how
that's
any
different
from
the
hypothetical
justice
stevens
put
to
you
where
the
legislature
tells
the
judges
what
to
do.
you
like
individual
discretion
rather
than
concrete
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
o'donnell,
you
introduced
evidence
of
group
membership,
right...
aa...
now,
i
guess
if
you
say
that
a
person
can't
be
sentenced
on
the
basis
of
his
membership,
i
guess
you
would
logically
have
to
say
he
shouldn't
be
sentenced
because
of
his
nonmembership
either.
but
doesn't
that
happen
every
time
somebody
who
doesn't
belong
to
aa
is
sentenced?
i
mean
your
client
can
come
in
and
say
i'm
a
member
of
aa.
and
this
other
fellow
is
being
punished
because
he's
a
nonmember
of
aa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there's
just
no
end.
once
you
say
you
can't
use
membership,
there's
no
end
to
every...
to
what
has
to
be
kept
out
of
all
our
sentencing
determinations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
a
belief?
certainly
it's
a
belief.
it's
a
belief
against...
against
drinking,
and
self-discipline...
all
those
are
beliefs,
aren't
they?
