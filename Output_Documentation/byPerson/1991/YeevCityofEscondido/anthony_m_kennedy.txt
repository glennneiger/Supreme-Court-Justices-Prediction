justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
a
large
extent,
that's
true
in
the
anti-discrimination
ordinance.
is
the
difference
the
loss
in
value
to
the
owner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we're
not
concerned
here
with
the
extent
to
which
the
economic
expectations
and
the
economic
real
values
of
the
owner
are
affected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
let
me
just
make
sure...
so
it
would
be
constitutional
for
the
state
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
no
more
than
the
blue
book
value
can
be
charged?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
my
statute...
you
have
a
statute
which
says
the
tenant
can
charge
no
more
than
the
blue
book
value.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
that
case,
your
clients
would
not
receive
this
value
that
you're
complaining
that
you've
lost
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
scheme
in
which
the
state
was
a
required
party
to
any
negotiation.
and
if
the
tenancy
is
sold,
the
landowner
gets
the
blue
book
value
of
his
improvements
and
the
state
gets
the
balance.
would
that
be
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
related
and
in
the
extent
to
which
a
premium
is
going
to
paid.
it's
not
going
to
be
given
as
a
windfall
to
the
property
owner,
if
the
state
considers
it
a
windfall,
and
it
used
the
money
for
parks
and
schools,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
reason
that
it's
a
close
case
is
because
that
there
is
a
property
interest
that's
being
affected
by
this
regulation?
and
the
question
is
whose
property
interest
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
a
circular
argument.
you're
assuming
that
that's
a
value
that's
his.
and
that's
the
whole
issue
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's...
no,
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
time
he
signed
the
tenancy,
it
was
a
tenancy
for,
i
take
it,
a
number
of
years,
which
has
now
expired,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
can
by
its
laws
extend
that
tenancy
and
extend
the
right
to
sell
it
so
that
the
economic
value
that's
given
by
the
law
is
just
and
is
constitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
assuming
that
absent
any
state
regulation,
he
could
not
have
this
premium
because
the
landlord
would
have
a
veto.
so
you
can't
just
say
that
he
has
this...
the
tenant,
he
or
she,
has
this
investment.
that's
the
whole
issue
in
the
case.
the
only
reason
he
does
is
because
the
pattern
of
regulation
that's
now
before
this
court
for
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that's
the
whole
theory
of
your
argument,
that
it's
designed
to
protect
these
homeowners
who
are
in
this
position,
the
tenancy
owners.
