well,
i
thought
he
said
it
was
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
his
property--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understood
that
was
what
he
said
was
taken.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
realistic
is
that
choice,
do
you
think,
able
to
get
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioners
own
mobile
home
parks
in
escondido,
california.
the
city
has
a
local
rent
control
ordinance
applicable
to
mobile
home
parks.
in
this
suit
against
the
city,
the
petitioners
alleged
that
the
city
rent
control
ordinance
in
conjunction
with
california's
mobile
home
residency
law
amounts
to
a
physical
occupation
of
their
land
because
it
enables
tenants
to
remain
on
the
land
indefinitely
at
below
market
rent.
they
contend
that
the
ordinance
on
its
face
constitutes
a
taking
of
their
property
under
the
fifth
amendment
entitling
them
to
compensation.
the
california
superior
court
dismissed
the
petitioner's
complaint
and
the
california
court
of
appeal
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment.
a
land
owner
has
a
per
se
right
to
compensation
under
the
takings
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
physical
occupational
of
his
land
only
where
the
government
requires
the
land
owner
to
submit
to
physical
occupation.
because
the
petitioners
have
voluntarily
rented
their
land
to
others
and
because
the
ordinance
on
its
face
neither
compels
petitioners
to
let
others
on
their
land
nor
requires
them
to
continue
renting
their
property
once
they
have
chosen
to
do
so.
petitioners
cannot
assert
a
per
se
right
to
compensation
under
the
takings
clause.
rather
than
authorizing
the
physical
occupation
of
petitioner's
property,
the
ordinance
instead
regulates
the
use
of
petitioner's
property.
petitioner's
takings
claim
must
therefore
be
assessed
under
our
jurisprudence
applicable
to
regulatory
takings
not
as
a
physical
taking
automatically
giving
rise
to
compensation.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion,
we
find
that
petitioner's
regulatory
takings
argument
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
justice
blackmun
and
justice
souter
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
