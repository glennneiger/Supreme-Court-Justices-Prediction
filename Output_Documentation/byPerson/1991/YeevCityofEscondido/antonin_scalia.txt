but
it
will
be
a
practical
alternative
if
you
win
this
other
case,
which
i'm
sure
you
expect
to
win,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
really
don't
know
that
it's
not
a
practical
alternative.
you
assert
that
it
ought
to
be
a
practical
alternative.
you're
asserting
that
in
another
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
every
anti-discrimination
ordinance
a
taking
of
property,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
they
do.
they
say
you
can't
keep
people
off
your
property
or
out
of
your
business
just
because
you
don't
like
their
race,
religion,
or
nationality.
is
that
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guessed
you
weren't,
but
tell
me
why
it's
any
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
becomes
a
taking
if
there's
an
overarching...
it
ceases
to
become
a
taking
if
there's
an
overarching
value?
i
thought
it
was
still
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
price
controls
on
theatre
tickets.
let's
assume
a
municipality
does
that
and
the
tickets
can't
be
sold
above
$20.
and
of
course,
they're
immediately
scalped
for
$100
if
there's
a
scarcity
of
them.
is
that
a
taking
of
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
the
same...
it's
the
same
thing
that
you're
talking
about
here,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
regulation
that
enables
somebody
else
other
than
the
person
who
without
the
regulation
would
make
the
profit
to
make
the
profit
is
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
every
time...
you
say
there's
been
a
massive
transfer
of
wealth.
except
for
the
adjective
massive,
there's
always
a
transfer
of
wealth
whenever
there's
price
control.
that's
the
object
of
price
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
every
price
control
does
what
you're
talking
about.
i
mean,
the
consumer
gets
wealth
which
he
would
otherwise
be
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
bring
it
in
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
win
nothing
if
you
bring
it
in
now.
i
mean,
even
you
win
the
case,
you're
going
to
have
a
decision
that
it's
not
constitutional
to
fail
to
provide
a
fair
return
on
the
investment.
that's
not
a
big
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
said
that
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
the
county
has
no
public...
the
public
purpose
that
the
county
asserts
that
it
has,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
you
tell
me
why
that
isn't
true,
is
that
it
is
really
just
counteracting
what
would
be
a
market
imperfection.
and
that
is,
when
a
tenant
leaves,
or
wants
to
leave,
it's
very
expensive
to
cart
off
this
mobile
home
that
isn't
worth
very
much
money
anywhere
else,
and
hence,
the
landlord
can
in
effect,
extract
from
the
would
be
departing
tenant
a
payment
in
order
to
obtain
the
profit
from
that
inconvenience.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
argument
he's
trying
to
run,
i
must...
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
it's
one
thing
to
eliminate
a
right
to
exclude.
it's
one...
it's
another
thing
to
take
it
from
me
and
give
it
somebody
else.
that
somehow
the
latter
constitutes
a
taking
even
though
the
former
doesn't.
and
what
has
effectively
occurred
here
is
that
the
right
and
the
economic
value
of
that
right
has
not
just
been
eliminated,
but
it's
been
taken
from
the
park
owner
and
given
to
the
tenant.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
rationale
basis
for
implementing
those
judgments,
no?
i
mean,
at
least,
even
if
you
don't
take
testimony,
it
is
certainly
open
to
say
that
this
is
irrational.
that
there
is
no
way
that
a
legislator
that
had
the
objective
in
mind,
which
you
express,
would
have
chosen
this
as
a
means
to
do
it.
isn't
that
argument
at
least
open?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
rational
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
will
you
tell
us
how
the
means-ends
relationship
is
adequate
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
basically
what
i
might
be
telling
you
is
why
a
rational
means
of
solving
the
$1,500
to
$2,000
problem
of...
that
it
takes
to
move
the
trailer
somewhere
else
or
to
sell
it
somebody
who
will
move
it,
why,
in
order
to
do
that,
you
have
to
place
a
system
that
allows
somebody
to
reap
a
$77,000
premium
in
some
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
pretty
easy
means,
namely
requiring
payment
of
no
less
than
the
blue
book
value
if
the
tenant
leaves
the
thing
on
the
premises.
that's
one
way
to
do
it.
now,
the
way
you
do
it
is
to
say
the
tenant
can
sublease
to
anybody
he
wants
at
whatever
rental
he
wants,
and
keep
the
proceeds.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
tenant
is
entitled
to
more
than
a
fair,
just,
and
reasonable
rental.
he's
entitled
to
keep
whatever
he
wants
out
of
the
transaction.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
seem
to
think
that
there's
a
pretty
close
correlation
between
fair,
just,
and
reasonable
and
market
price,
and
there
certainly
isn't.
and
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
price
controls.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
tenant
is
getting
the
market
price,
which
very
often
is
quite
a
bit
above
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wasn't
talking
about
the
takings
clause
immediately,
i
was
asking
you
to
explain
why
this
is
reasonable
regulation.
if
we're
just
approaching
it
as
an
ordinary
regulatory
taking
case,
something
that
has
deprived
an
individual
of
the
value
of
his
property.
why
is
this
a
reasonable
regulation
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there's
no
readily
imaginable
means
by
which
you
could
achieve
the
same
result
without
that
effect.
but
here
there
is.
if
the
result...
if
the
purpose
is
what
you
say
it
is,
this
is
a
ridiculous
way
to
achieve
that
purpose,
to
permit
this
enormous
wealth
transfer.
you
have
to
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
usery
laws,
but
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
do
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
facial
challenge
is
to
a
rent
control
ordinance,
mr.
phillips,
in
which
there
are
limits
put
on
the
rent
that
the
landlord
can
charge,
but
no
limits
whatever
upon
the
rents
that
the
tenants
can
charge
in
subleasing.
would
that
be
a
valid
ordinance?
do
you
think
it
would
be
challengeable
on
its
face?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
but
it
just
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
the
state
says
we
have
some
interest
that
we're
furthering
by
preventing
landlords
from
charging
more
than
a
certain
amount,
but
their
tenants
can
sublease
for
whatever
they
want.
now
what
possible
state
interest
would
that
achieve?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
contradicted
by
the
fact
that
you
have
price
controls.
if
there's
a
whole
competitive
market
out
there,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
so
many
that
the
state
doesn't
the
state
doesn't
think
it
necessary
to
have
price
controls.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
state
believed
that,
it
wouldn't
have
price
controls.
it
would
say,
hey,
we
don't
need
price
controls
because
there
are
a
lot
of
options.
the
market
will
take
care
of
that.
you
don't
have
to
live
in
a
mobile
home.
you
can
live
somewhere
else.
we
don't
need
price
controls.
the
very...
the
very
decision
to
impose
price
controls
shows
that
that's
not
true.
