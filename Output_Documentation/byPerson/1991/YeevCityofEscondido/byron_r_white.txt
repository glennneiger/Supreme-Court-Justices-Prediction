white
do
you
think
the
ordinance
requires
the
owner
of
the
property
to
rent
in
perpetuity?
justice
byron
r.
white
can't
the
landlord
decide
just
not
to
use
the
property
for
this
purpose
anymore?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
what
the
ordinance
says,
or
you
say
it's
just
impractical?
justice
byron
r.
white
anyway,
that's
the
state
law
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
win,
everybody
will
know
it
is
a
practical
alternative.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
both
of
them.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
said
twice,
i
think,
that
three
courts
of
appeals
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
three
courts
of
appeals,
that's
just
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
the
ninth
circuit
is
different.
