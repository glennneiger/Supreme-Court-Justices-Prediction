mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tenant
who
sold
the
coach
to
mrs.
morrison
in
the
azul
case
got
$77,000
for
a
$5,000
coach.
and
we
proved
that
trial
in
that
case
that
it
was
the
direct
result
of
vacancy
control,
could
not
have
occurred
without
vacancy
control,
and
all
the
legal
arguments
in
the
world
can't
disguise
that
fact.
now
how
did
it
happen?
it
happened
because
the
rent
control
ordinance
gives
two
sets
of
rights
in
the
property
to
the
tenant
in
residence.
the
first
are
possessory,
and
the
second
relate
to
rents.
what
are
those
possessory
rights?
the
right
to
occupy
at
a
reduced
rate
in
perpetuity,
and
secondly,
the
right
for
the
first
time
to
sell
that
right
without
the
consent
of
the
landlord
to
an
incoming
tenant.
with
respect
to
the
rents,
the
tenant
receives
the
right
to
increase
the
rents,
to
collect
the
increase,
and
to
keep
the
proceeds
so
collected.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
yes,
it--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--no,
not
effectively.
it's
not
a
practical
alternative.
the
reality
is--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--no,
what
happens
is
that
there's
a
state
system
for
going
out
of
business
that,
in
conjunction
with
local
ordinances,
precludes
that
alternative
as
a
practical
reality.
for
example,
i'm
in
a
case
where
we
have
finished
4
years
of
administrative
hearings
where
we've
just
gotten
the
administrative
record,
and
the
condition
that
they
imposed
to
going
out
of
the
business
was
that
we
pay
the
in-place
value,
exactly
the
harm
that
we're
talking
about
here.
and
now
we've
got
3
or
4
more
years
of
litigation
while
we
try
to
contest
the
constitutional
validity
of
imposing
a
condition
of
that
nature
upon
us
as
a
condition
for
our
going
out
of
business.
it's
not
a
practical
alternative.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
well,
it
happens--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--no,
but
it
happens
to
be
the
case
that
the
local
agency
is
given
the
right
under
state
law
to
impose
the
conditions,
and
it's
the
local
agency
that
then
does
impose
the
conditions.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
i
would
have
come
all
the
back
here
in
about
7
years,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
i
know
that
right
now
nobody's
gotten
out
of
business,
and
that
we've
been
litigating
it
for
4
years.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
if
we
win
in
this
case
or
the
subsequent
case?
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
if
we
win
in
this
case,
we'll
short-cut
the
other
one
because
we
will
have
established
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
impose
that
condition.
it
is
an
unconstitutional
taking.
but
we're
talking
about
a
transfer
of
rights
here.
this
is
not
the
garden-variety
police
power
case
that--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--we
just
got
the
administrative
record
4
years
down
the
line,
your
honor,
so
we're
filing
in
the
lower
courts
in
california
at
this
moment.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
not
at
this
time,
it
is
not.
we're
talking
about
a
transfer
of
rights,
not
a
garden-variety
police-power
case
where
there's
a
diminution
of
the
value
of
the
property.
this
is
out
and
out
expropriation
of
real
property
rights
and
a
transfer
to
a
favored
group
of
citizens.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
this
case
did
not.
it's
a
pleadings
case.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
correct.
and
we're
here
on
the
pleadings.
and
as
a
consequence,
we
have
to
look
to
the
pleadings.
those
are
the
facts
that
are
properly
before
the
court.
and
what
do
the
pleadings
tell
us?
that
an
ordinance
was
passed,
the
tenants
were
given
the
right
to
occupy
at
a
reduced
rate.
they
can
sell
that
right
for
the
first
time
to
an
incoming
tenant.
that
they
do
sell
it
and
that
they
receive
a
profit
when
they
sell
it
by
selling
the
coach
for
more
than
it's
worth,
and
that
premium
value
represents
the
value
of
the
interest
of
property
that
are
transferred
under
the
ordinance.
what
is
the
city's
defense
to
this
claim?
stripped
of
its
sociology,
it's
basically
this:
that
the
tenants
own
a
portable
structure
which
they
bring
onto
my
client's
land
on
wheels.
while
it's
parked
on
my
client's
land,
they
put
it
on
jacks.
and
when
it
gets
old
enough,
or
if
it
becomes
obsolescence
and
the
tenant
decides
to
remove
it,
they
put
wheels
under
it
again
and
they
haul
it
off.
and
the
city
says,
under
the
circumstances,
this
is
such
a
unique
relationship
that
we
are
justified
in
creating
thousands
of
estates
in
land
in
transferring
the
value
to
the
tenants
who
own
the
portable
structures.
and
what
are
the
justifications
given
for
this...
that
is
(1)
it
preserves
low
and
moderate-income
housing,
and
(2)
it
protects
the
investment.
we
need
to
examine
this
claim
from
a
number
of
perspectives.
first,
three
federal
courts
of
appeal
have
held
this
to
be
a
physical
taking
because
it
is.
the
local
ordinance
requires
that
we
renew
and
that
we
cannot
terminate
any
leases
for
present
tenants
as
well
as
prospective
tenants.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
yes,
your
honor,
the
ordinance
by
itself
achieves
this
effect.
you
have...
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
ordinance,
the
park
owner
has
effective
ability
to
control
who
will
get
an
invitation
onto
his
land.
and
if
i
could
put
this
in
context,
it
is
the
florida
power
case
that
says
it's
the
invitation
that
makes
the
difference.
and
loretto
tells
us
the
invitation
has
to
be
offered
by
someone
who
has
the
authority
to
give
the
invitation.
as
this
court
will
recall
in
loretto,
the
prior
owner...
the
cable
company
was
not
a
stranger
to
the
premises.
the
prior
owner
had
given
consent
to
be
there.
then
mrs.
loretto
came
on,
bought
the
property,
looked
around,
told
the
cable
company
we're
revoking
your
invitation.
and
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
had
no
problem
in
finding
that
continued
occupancy
under
compulsion
of
the
law,
was
a
physical
per
se
taking.
exactly
the
same
thing
occurs
here.
the
owner
remains
the
same,
the
tenants
are
different,
and
the
departing
tenant
who
doesn't
have
the
right
but
for
the
law
invites
the
incoming
tenant
in,
who's
then
an
interloper
with
a
government
license,
and
the
ordinance
causes
the
owner
to
become
disabled
from
controlling
that
access.
and
the
way--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--certainly
the
incoming
tenant
you
could
obviously
argue
in
a
typical
rent
control
case,
which
this
is
not,
that
it's
the
holdover
tenant
as
well.
but
the
incoming
tenant
has
been
invited
onto
the
premises
by
the
departing
tenant.
he
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
extend
the
invitation.
before
the
ordinance
was
passed,
the
park
owner
had
the
power
and
the
right
to
control
who
would
get
an
invitation
onto
his
property
because
he
would
exercise
that
control
by
insisting
that
the
incoming
tenant
agree
to
rental
terms.
and
if
that
incoming
tenant
did
not
agree
to
the
rental
terms,
the
park
owner
had
every
right
not
to
allow
him
onto
the
property
or
to
extend
the
invitation.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
it's
not,
your
honor,
and
we're
not
claiming--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--we're
certainly
not
claiming
that
kind
of
right
here.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
because
there
are
overriding
and
overarching
values
that
are
to
be
served.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
well,
it
can
be
the
case,
of
course,
that
the
person
is
there
on
the
premises,
but
i
believe
that
we
finally
decided
there
are
purposes
that
are
so
substantial
and
overarching
that
we
can
require
that
people
be
treated
without
being
discriminated
against.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
well,
that's
true.
and
in
terms
of
determining--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
the
problem
that
i'm
facing
here
is
we
are
facing
two
fundamental
kinds
of
rights
that
collide
with
each
other,
and
that
case
is
not
the
case
that's
presently
before
the
court.
and
so
i
can't
resolve
in
an
instant
the
colliding
of
those
particular
rights.
i
don't
know
how
that
will
come
down
when
that
becomes
an
issue.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
correct.
and
this
is
absolutely
unlike
ordinary
rent
control
because
here
the
owner
of
the
property
loses
the
ability
to
decide
who's
going
to
occupy
his
property.
the
tenant
in
a
typical
rent
control
case
does
not
have
the
power
to
determine
the
identity
of
the
new
tenant,
to
set
the
terms
of
the
occupancy
in
terms
of
its
rent,
nor
do
they
have
the
right
to
sell
the...
the
right
to
occupy
at
a
reduced
rate.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
it's
not.
in
the
case
of
the
physical
taking,
it
could
well
be
the
case
that
there'd
be
insignificant
loss
of
value,
and
it
still
would
be
a
physical
taking.
the
difference
is
that
we're
making--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
we're
concerned,
of
course,
if
we
look
at
it
as
a
regulatory
taking,
which
i'll
discuss
in
a
few
minutes,
but
we
are
not
concerned
with
it
if
it's
viewed,
as
the
three
lower
courts
of
appeal
viewed
it,
as
physical
taking,
because
there
the
economic
consequences
are
not
particularly
relevant
in
resolving
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the...
the
conduct
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
oh,
of
course,
because
the
ordinance
itself
provides
for
rent
control
and
eviction
control.
it
states
that
we
cannot
refuse
to
renew,
nor
can
we
terminate
any
lease
for
present
tenants
or
any
prospective
purchasers
as
to
all
spaces
not
covered
by
the
mobilehome
park
residency
law.
so
that
if
tomorrow,
or
2
hours
ago,
the
state
mobilehome
park
residency
law
were
repealed,
the
ordinance
itself
would
accomplish
exactly
the
same
end.
now--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--you
mean
and
they
allowed
the
tenant--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--if
they
said
that,
you
may
have
just
a
physical
taking
on
that
basis.
but
we
have
a
different
mechanism
that
works
here.
after
the
ordinance
is
passed,
the
park
owner
is
no
longer
free
to
tell
the
incoming
tenant
i
will
invite
you
on
to
these
premises,
if
but
only
if
we
come
to
an
agreement
on
rental
terms.
and
if
we
do
not,
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
ordinance,
the
park
owner
has
the
right
to
tell
the
tenant
not
to
come
on.
that
changes.
once
the
ordinance
is
passed,
the
tenant
for
the
first
time
is
vested
with
the
absolute
right
to
invite
the
tenant
on
without
a
veto
power
of
any
kind
over
the
park
owner,
and
the
landowner
is
stripped
of
his
right
and
his
power--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--to
condition
his
consent.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
that's
correct,
and
i
stand
corrected
on
that.
there
are
those...
mild...
modern...
strike
that...
minor
abilities
on
the
part
of
the
park
owner
to
still
control
who
comes
on.
but
the
plain
fact
is
that
the
massive
loss
of
control
that
he
experienced
by
being
able
to
say
to
somebody,
unless
we
come
to
terms
that
are
agreeable,
you
can't
come
on
has
been
transferred
to
the
tenant,
and
the
park
owner
himself
has
been
stripped
of
his
right
and
his
power.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
but
what
he
can
do
is
he
can
still
distribute
the
benefits
in
a
variety
of
ways.
he
could
give
the
apartment
with
its
rent
control
benefits
to
his
friends,
to
his
relatives.
he
controls
the
distribution
of
the
benefits,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
accept
onto
premises
any
particular
tenant
as
long
as
he
has
a
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
basis
for
doing
so.
but
here,
the
landlord
can
no
longer
exclude.
he
has
lost
the
right
to
exclude,
and
the
ordinance
transfers
that
right,
and
thus,
it's
a
physical
taking.
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--it
was
transferred
to
the
tenant,
your
honor,
who
now
has
the
right
to
determine
who
comes
in
by
selling
his
coach.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
the
city
of
escondido
didn't
get
the
transfer;
it
causes
the
transfer.
it
didn't
get
the
transferred
value.
we
can
also
look
at
takings
as
a
continuum,
with
loretto
on
the
one
end
and
agins
on
the
other,
and
ask
ourselves,
where
we
have
an
expropriation
of
the
right
to
impose
rent
increases,
collect
the
rent
increases,
and
keep
them,
and
transfer
that
right
over
to
the
departing
tenant,
have
we
reached
that
point
that
hodel
v.
irving
tells
us,
that
we
have
a
fundamental
attribute
of
property
which
is
expropriated
or
extinguished?
we
believe
so,
and
it's
a
taking.
let's
look
at
mrs.
morrison's
case
again.
the
tenant
got
$77,000,
which
with
a
cap
rate
of
10,
comes
out
to
about
$650
a
month.
her
rent
was
$340.
he
took
two-thirds
of
the
rent
due
to
the
property,
pocketed
it,
and
left
the
premises.
and
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
that
is
an
out
and
out
expropriation
of
property
and
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
sell
the
refrigerator.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
it
looks
a
lot
like
it.
that
it's
key
money...
that's
what
it
was
called
in
an
apartment
context,
and
generally
rendered
illegal.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
it
sure
did.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
yes.
and
with
respect
to--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--conceivably
it
could
be.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
yes,
if
you
look
at
the
purpose,
because
the
purpose
is
not
served
of
keeping
the
prices
down
to
the
$10
or
whatever
the
limit
was,
$20,
on
the
tickets.
absent
a
justifying
purpose--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--not
necessarily.
here
we
have
other
elements.
we've
got
a
transfer
of
an
interest
in
real
property
in
order
to
create
then
the
value
or
the
wealth.
and
that
transfer
of
the
interest
in
real
property,
that
is
the
right
to
determine
who
will
occupy
it,
and
an
elimination
of
the
right
to
exclude,
makes
it
fundamentally
different
than
just
a
price
control
kind
of
case.
and
that's
why
rent
control
in
this
context,
in
a
mobile
home
park
context,
involves
the
transfer
of
real
property
interest
to
people
who
have
personal
property.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
it
wouldn't.
you'd
still
have
the
physical
taking.
it's
the
departing
tenant
who
can
determine--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--it
is
a
part
of
our
case,
but
if
we...
to
address
the
hypothetical--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--no,
but
if
you...
i'm
just
addressing
the
hypothetical.
and
that
is
if
you
put
a
limit
on
the
price,
you
would
still
have
a
physical
taking
because
the
departing
tenant
still
determines
who's
invited
onto
the
property,
and
the
owner
has
lost
the
power
to
exclude.
now,
under
nollan,
we
have
a...
the
test
is
substantially
advanced:
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
what
is
the
governmental
interest
in
mrs.
morrison's
case,
when
a
tenant
takes
$77,000,
puts
it
in
his
pocket,
and
leaves
the
premises
forever
burdened
with
the
additional
cost
of
occupancy?
i
submit
there
is
no
public
purpose,
and
if
you
do
it
1
time
or
3,000
times,
a
private
purpose
does
not
become
a
public
purpose.
but
the
city
also
gives
us
two
other
reasons.
one
is
to
preserve
low-and
moderate-income
housing.
that's
by
and
large
disappeared
from
the
briefs.
we've
had
two
trials
on
the
issue.
we
proved
to
the
trial
court's
satisfaction
that
it--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--yes,
this
case
did
come
up
on
demurrer,
your
honor.
i'm
referring
to
the
facts
in
the
azul
case,
which
were
noted
in
the--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--the
azul
pacifico
v.
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
yes,
your...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
i'm
talking
about
the
example
used
by
judge
kazinsky
in
his
decision
to
illustrate
the
core
problem
of
the
case,
that
there's
a
massive
transfer
or
wealth
to
a
departing
tenant
who
owns
a
depreciating
asset.
and
so--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--yes,
it
was.
i
took
her
deposition,
your
honor,
and
what
occurred
was
that
she
testified
she
bought
the
coach.
i
asked
her--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--okay,
fine.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
because
it
show
what
happens
in
fact,
as
what
is
alleged
in
theory
in
this
case.
we
were
thrown
out
on
the
pleadings.
we
never
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
facts,
but
the
azul
case
provided
us
with
the
factual
context
we
need
to
show
how
this
actually
occurs,
as
opposed
to
just
stating
that
it
occurs
as
a
matter
of
theory.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
that's
correct.
two
ninth
circuit
decisions
and
the
third
circuit
in
pinewood
v.--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--okay.
two
courts
of
appeal.
two
different
panels
at
two
different
times
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
okay.
it
could
be.
when
i
appear
before
the
different
panels,
sometimes,
it
seems
like
it.
in
any
event,
they...
the
purpose
is
to
preserve
low-and
moderate-income
housing,
we're
told.
and
all
of
a
sudden
that
pretty
much
has
disappeared
because
we
demonstrated
that
didn't
occur.
so--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--that's
correct,
but
what
you
don't--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--but
he
doesn't
get
an
estate
in
the
provider's
land.
they
didn't
give
him
a
life
estate
in
a
bottling
company.
i
mean,
the
reality
is
that...
i
was
thinking
about
keystone
case
for
a
while,
and
i
said,
well,
there's
a
possible
argument
for
transfer
of
wealth.
the
house
if
it's
up
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
it
falls
in
a
hole.
but
they
didn't
give
the
owner
of
the
house
the
right
to
and
mine
the
coal.
it
didn't
give
the
owner
of
the
house
the
right
to
go
and
occupy
the
mine.
the
fact
is
that
this
of
necessity
involves
the
creation
of
an
estate
in
land
of
another
and
transfers
the
wealth
of
that
land
to
the
tenant.
and
the
argument
that
they
then
advance
is
that
this
is
justified
because
it
protects
the
tenant's
investment.
that
raises
at
least
two
factual
questions
to
which
we're
entitled
to
a
trial.
one
is,
what
is
the
extent
of
the
investment?
ninety-six
percent
of
the
coaches
in
california
are
10
to
50
years
old.
many
of
them
cost
$5,000
brand
new.
and
if
we
have
a
chance
to
a
trial,
we'll
prove
that
a
lot
of
the
coaches
have
no
significant
investment
at
all.
and
as
well,
what
we've
got
is
a
question:
can
an
end
be
reached?
if
you're
going
to
substantially
advance
an
end,
it
presumes
that
the
end
can
be
accomplished.
and
we
submit,
and
expert
testimony
will
be
offered,
you
cannot
stop
a
wasting
asset
from
depreciating.
it's
of
the
very
nature
of
it,
and
this
ordinance
and
their
justification
for
it
requires
that
you
revoke
the
laws
of
economics
as
they
relate
to
personal
property.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
what
cures
the
problem
in
this
case
is
to
permit
the
park
to
raise
rent
at
the
time
of
sale
so
that
they--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--no,
i'm
not.
what
it
does
is
that's
the
technique
and
device
that
the
owner
has
available
to
select
the
identity
of
the
incoming
tenant,
as
well
as
to
capture...
there
were
two
sets
of
rights...
to
capture
the
rights
to
rents
which
are
otherwise
transferred
to
party
in
tenant.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
there
are
two
elements
to
my
case.
but
that
will
solve
the
problem.
the
element
of
the
case--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--that's...
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
getting
closer
to
a
constitutional
result,
as
long
as
you
can
choose
the
tenant,
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
as...
because
the
tenant
as
a
consequence...
i
presume
that
part
of
it
also
is
that
the
tenant
cannot
raise...
cannot
sell
the
coach
for
more
than
it's
worth.
was
that
part
of
the
hypothetical?
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
right.
that
would
still
be
unconstitutional
because,
as
i
said,
there
two
classes
of
rights:
possessory
interests
and
the
rights
to
rents
which
are
real
property.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
you
can
select
the
tenant...
because
the
tenant
in
a
typical
apartment
situation
cannot
sell
the
right
to
occupancy.
and
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
the
tenant
can
still
charge
more
for
the
coach
than
he
would
be
able
to
without
the--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--generally--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
it's
been
made
illegal
in
a
lot
of
places
where
we've
got
new
generation
rent
controls
as
a
public
purpose
that
the
legislation
wanted
to
serve.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
well,
that's
not
the
case.
what
happens
that...
in
this
case,
for
example--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
provides
for
a
fair
return,
but
it
also
contains
a
provision
that
rents
are
rolled
back
2-1/2
years.
so
i
don't
know
how
you
get
fair
return
by
rolling
back
rents
2-1/2
years.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
i
am
not
making
that
argument--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
the
plain
fact
is
they
are
not
high
enough.
and
we've
got
a
2-1/2-year
rollback.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
absolutely.
it's
never
been
part
of
the
case.
and--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--i
thought
i
was
asked
a
question--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
i
was--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--i
thought
i
was
responding
to
a
question,
frankly,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--well,
first
of
all,
you
know,
this
case
is
here
on
the
pleadings,
and
those
aren't
the
facts
that
are
part
of
the
record,
and
they
hypothesize
that
as
a
purpose.
but
the
reality
is
that
the
coach
has
a
certain
value,
a
box
value,
that's
determined
by
traditional
methods
of
evaldation,
like
the
kelley
blue
book,
and
that
box
value
is
obtainable
whether
it's
on
the
pad
or
off
the
pad.
but
that's
all
the
tenant
owns.
so
the
maximum
exposure
that
the
tenant
faces,
as
pointed
out
in
hirsch
v.
hirsch
article,
is
the
cost
of
moving.
and
the
cost
of
moving,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
$1,500,
translates
into
a
$12.50
rent
increase
per
month.
that's
the
maximum
leverage
that
the
landlord
has
over
the
tenant
under
those
circumstances.
and
for
that,
you
don't
give
a
$77,000
estate
in
land
in
order
to
protect
against
that
kind
of
overreaching,
which
is
what
is
occurring
under
the
present
rent
control
ordinances.
i
think
as
well,
and
somewhat
on
point
there,
is
that
their
argument
also
is
a
new
wrinkle
that
high
rents
cause
distress
sale
prices.
what
the
reality
is
that
in
fact
what
we
have
found,
the
only
systematic
study
is
hirsch
v.
hirsch,
that
no
coaches
are
selling
for
below
blue
book
value
anywhere
in
the
state
of
california
but
for
two
rural
jurisdictions,
where
the
plentitude
of
space
is
apparently
puts
a
down
pressure
on
the
selling
price
of
coaches.
but
secondly,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
the
park
owner
can
only
raise
rents
at
the
time
of
sale.
he
wants
the
sale
to
occur
and,
as
a
consequence,
would
facilitate
the
sale.
and
third,
it
violates
the
close-fit
notions
of
nollan
in
any
event
because
if
you're
concerned
about
the
park
owner
depressing
prices
so
that
he
can
buy
the
coach,
pass
a
law
that
says
something
like
the
park
owner
can
only
buy
at
blue
book
value
and
not
less.
or,
if
you're
concerned
about
a
third
person
coming
in,
say
to
the
third
person...
or
say
to
the
park
owner,
you
can
only
charge
rents
that
are
charged
in
comparable
spaces
in
areas
that
are
near
us
in
non-rent-controlled
environments.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
you
can't
buy
for
less
than
the
blue
book
value
if
you're
the
park
owner
in
order
to
avoid
the
sales--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
constitutional
because
what
i
think
would
occur
there
is
that
the
tenant
would
argue
that
you...
the
ordinance
creates
the
power
for
somebody
else
to
take
their
property
for
less
than
its
value.
i
mean,
it's
conceivable.
but,
you
know,
it
looks
like
a
typical
rent
control
case
or
price
control
case
to
me.
i
suspect
it's
a
constitutional
exercise
of
power.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
within
the
context
of
a
mobile
home
coach,
that's
correct
that
they
wouldn't
have
the
monetized
rents
transferred
to
the
departing
tenant,
but
they
would
have
lost
their
right
to
control
occupancy,
they
would
have
lost
the
right
to
exclude.
so
there's
still
a
taking,
even
though
you
control
the
price
of
the
coach,
and
it
can't
be
sold
for
more
than
blue
book
value.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
no,
it
depends
on
what
the
provisions
of
the
lease
were
with
respect
to
assignment
and
a
variety
of
matters
like
that.
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
has
the
tenant...
does
the
lease
agreement
provide
that
the
tenant
has
the
right
to
assign
or
not
assign?
is
that
written
in
lease
as
well?
i
don't
know
because
i'm
looking
at
who
has
the
right
to
decide--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--it
still
would
be
unconstitutional
if
what
occurs
is
that
we
are
limited
to
controlling
the
access
to
the
property
because
we
no
longer
have
the
ability
to
essentially
act
as
a
veto
power
by
requiring
a
rental
agreement
from
a
new,
incoming
tenant
before
they
come
in.
in
any
event,
what
you
can't
do--
mr.
robert
j.
jagiello
--thank
you,
your
honor.
