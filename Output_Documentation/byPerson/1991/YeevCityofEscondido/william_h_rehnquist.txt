chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1947,
john
k.
yee
v.
city
of
escondido.
mr.
jagiello,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jagiello,
why
don't
you
slow
down
a
little
bit
in
your
presentation.
i
think
we
could
follow
you
more
easily.
did
this
case
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
demurrer
was
sustained?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
describe
exactly
what
it
is
that
is
the
physical
taking
here?
because
i
have
a
little
trouble
grasping
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
incoming
tenant
is
the
one
who
is
physically
occupying
the
property
against
the
will
of
the
owner,
corresponding
to
the
cable
company
in
loretto?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we've
never
held,
so
far
as
i
know,
mr.
jagiello,
that
where
you're
talking
about
a
physical
taking,
that
the
governmental
purpose
made
any
different
at
all...
any
difference
at
all,
however
magnificent
it
may
have
been
or
however
poor
it
may
have
been.
we...
i
don't
believe
we've
ever
used
governmental
purpose
as
a
basis
for
evaluating
whether
there's
been
a
physical
occupation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
does
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
make
any
sense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can't
you
say
that
in
an
anti-discrimination
ordinance,
something
like
an
ordinary
rent
control
ordinance
limits
the
authority
of
the
landowner.
he
can't
charge
exactly
what
he
wants
but...
in
a
rent
control
case.
but
that...
we've
upheld
ordinary
rent
control
as
not
anything
like
a
physical
occupation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
an
ordinary
rent
control
ordinance,
which
you
say
you
don't
challenge,
and
which
the
court
has
upheld,
the
landowner,
the
landlord
does
not
have
the
right
to
insist
on
rental
terms
that
he
wishes
to
impose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
this
came
up
on
demurrer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ninth
circuit
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
when
you
speak
of
mrs.
morrison,
you're
not
talking
about
a
party
to
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
based
on
a
trial
transcript
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
i
wanted
to
find
out
was
whethen
it
was
based
on
a
trial
transcript.
i've
now
found
that
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
is
it
relevant
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
didn't
raise
that
in
your
petition.
you
didn't
claim
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
that
the...
you
didn't
get
a
fair
return
on
the
profit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
jagiello.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
one
thing
to
talk
about
someone...
your
opponent's
concessions.
it's
another
thing
to
argue
your
own
case.
i
think
you
really
argue
your
own
case
now.
what
you're
saying
is
perhaps
that
he
should
have
conceded,
but
i
agree
with
justice
stevens.
i
don't
think
he
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
point
do
you
say
they
chose
to
do
that,
mr.
phillips?
certainly
their
complaint
in
the
superior
court
just
said
a
fifth
amendment
taking.
it
didn't
opt
for
one
theory
or
another.
and
the
complaint
was
sustained,
demurrer
was
sustained
without
leave
to
amend.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
in
your
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the...
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
was
to
give
benefits
to
people
who
were
economically
needful
of
them.
now,
you
know,
perhaps
that's
something...
that's
an
issue
that
might
have
been
tried,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
is
not
subject
to
any
sort
of
review
in
the
courts.
that
that
determination
by
the
legislature--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you
say
that
so
long
as
the
landlord
is
getting
a
fair
return
on
the
value
of
his
investment,
the
state
can
let
the
windfall,
or
require
the
windfall
to
go
somewhere
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
your
position,
mr.
phillips,
that
the
regulatory
takings
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
raised
below,
and
shouldn't
be
considered
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
also
easier
to
justify
the
sustaining
of
a
demurrer
without
leave
to
amend
where
you're
talking
about
a
claim
of
physical
occupation
than
you
are
when
you're
talking
about
an
invalid
regulatory
taking,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1947,
yee
versus
city
of
escondido
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
