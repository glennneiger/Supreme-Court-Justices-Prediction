justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
other
case
in
the
appellate
courts
or
still
before
the
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
a
reported
case,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
also,
can
i
ask
one
question?
it's
sort
of
a
background
question.
as
i
understand
it,
some
of
the
restrictions
that
make
ownership
costly
in
this
area
are
imposed
by
a
statute,
the
california
mobilehome
residency
law.
and
i
understand
you
haven't
challenged
that
statute.
is
it
your
position
that
if
that
statute
were
repealed
entirely
that
you
would
still
have
just
as
strong
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
the
rent
control
has
anything
to
do
with
your
taking
claim.
is
that
an
essential
part?
i
mean,
wouldn't
it
be
a
taking
whether
or
not
they
fixed
the
rents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
say
people
in...
people
that
are
currently
occupying
you
must
allow
to
continue
to
occupy,
and
you
can't
turn
down
future
tenants
for...
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
different...
i
can
remember
back
many
years
ago
during
rent
control
when
the
tenant
could
get
a
lot
of
money
for
the
furniture
when
there
would
be
a
new
tenant
coming
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
basically
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
constitute
a
taking
in
that
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
constitutionality
be
saved
if
the
city
went
ahead
and
regulated
the...
the
price
of
the
sale
of
the
homes?
put
a
ceiling
on
it
so
that
the
tenant
couldn't
get
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
profit
by
the
tenant
is
not
a
part
of
your
case,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
eliminate
it
by
putting
a
ceiling
on,
it
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
on...
assuming
that
rent
control
is
permissible,
what
would
cure
the
constitutional
violation
that
you
see?
the
right
to
pick
a
tenant
and
charge
him
whatever
you
want?
or
the
right
to
just
pick
a
different
tenant
that
you
happen
to
like
his
looks
better
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you're
attacking
rent
control,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
heart
of
your
case,
then,
is
the
inability
of
the
landlord
to
raise
the
rent
when
there's
a
change
in
the
occupancy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
would
be
constitutional
for
the
city
say
the
same
rent
shall
apply
after
a
change
of
ownership
but
you
can
put
in
any
tenant
you
want
to.
would
that
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
you
get
no
monetary
benefit
out
of
the
choice
then?
what
the
monetary
loss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
hypothetical
simply
is
that
you
may
pass
on
any
tenant
you
want,
the
qualification
of
the
tenant,
but
you
may
not
raise
the
rent
upon
the
transfer
of
ownership.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
my
hypothetical,
how
is
that
different
from
any
other
rent
control
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
he
sell?
he
says,
i'll
leave...
says
the
tenant,
i
will
leave...
i'm
willing
to
give
up
my
apartment
so
you
can
rent
it
if
you
give
me
$5,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
sort
of
thing
used
to
happen
during
rent
control
in
new
york,
washington,
chicago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
assuming
always
that
the
rent
control
enables
you
to
get
a
fair
return
on
your
investment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
we
have
to
assume
it's
the
case
because
the
ordinance
provides
for
a
fair
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
we
assume
that
the
rent
control
is
invalid
because
the
rents
are
not
high
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
don't
we
have
to
assume
they
are
high
enough
to
give
you
a
return
on
your
capital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
him
to
say
that
the
same...
essentially
the
same
provision
was
in
the
rent
control
ordinance,
and
that's
why
he
didn't
challenge
the
statute.
do
i
misunderstand
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
told
me
the
case
would
be
just
as
strong
if
they
repealed
the
statute,
and
you're
saying
that
he
just
hasn't
read
the
whole
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
don't
decide
those
issues,
i
suppose
you'd
just
be
back
right
away,
and
they'd
just
re-raise
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
they'll
still
be
fighting
about
the
ordinance,
though,
on
those
grounds.
