mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners'
counsel
has
explicitly
conceded,
both
prior
to
this
appearance
and
here
before
the
court
today,
that
if
this
case
involved
merely
rent
control,
there
would
be
no
serious
constitutional
issue
posed.
petitioners,
prior
to
this
argument,
seemed
to
have
conceded
because
they
did
not
challenge
the
state
statute
itself,
that
california's
residency
law,
which
requires
park
owners
to
permit
homeowners
to
sell
their
homes
in
place
and
to
lease
those
properties
to
an
incoming
home
purchaser,
is
itself
not
unconstitutional.
i
assume
that
concession
to
have
been
based
on
the
connecticut
decisions
that
this
court
has
summarily
affirmed
in
the
past.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
did
say
that.
the
problem
with
that
argument,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
rent
control
in
escondido
simply
fills
in
interstitially
where
the
state
statute
otherwise
doesn't
control.
so
by
its
own
force,
at
least
as
things
stand
right
now,
that
there
is
no
provision
that
you
could
enforce
through
city
law
to
guarantee
the
hold
over
tenants'
rights
under
those
circumstances.
those
rights
are
derived
from
the
state
law.
it's
only
in
those
areas
where
there's
no
homeowner
subletting--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
problem
if
they
repeal
the
statute
is
then
you
have
a
statutory
interpretation
question
of
what
it
means
to
say
that
where
the
protections
of
the
state
law
do
not
apply.
and
if
they
don't
apply
because
it
doesn't
exist,
i
don't
know
what
the
city
would
do
with
that
particular
circumstance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
fair
enough.
although
i
don't
read
him
to
have
challenged
in
any
of
his
briefs
directly
and
exclusively
the
notion
that
the
holdover
tenancy
provisions
that
are
embodied
in
the
state
law
are
by
themselves
unconstitutional.
certainly
no...
as
i
understood
his
argument,
he
was
saying
that
there
are
these
two...
two
courts
of
appeals
who
have
reached
these
conclusions,
neither
of
which
has
been
prepared
to
condemn
the
holdover
provisions
by
themselves.
and
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
recognized
that
that's
a
very
different
case.
so...
but
you
may
be
right.
it's
not
a
concession,
but
it
seems
to
me
settled
law
at
this
stage,
that
those
two
forms
of
regulation
are
clearly
permissible.
where
petitioners,
i
think,
now
urge
the
court
to
draw
the
constitutional
line
is
when
these
two
forms
of
otherwise
perfectly
permissible
regulation
overlap.
and
in
that
case,
their
argument
is
that
this
is
no
longer
even
a
more
serious
regulatory
takings
issue
under
the
fifth
amendment,
but
that
these
two
forms
of
regulation
are
mystically
converted
into
an
occupation
of
physical
property,
and
therefore,
requires
per
se
condemnation
under
the
constitution.
there
are
two
fundamental
flaws
in
the
petitioners'
arguments
that
will
be
the
main
theme
of
my
argument
today.
first,
the
presence
of
more
than
one
form
of
regulation
by
a
governmental
entity
may
complicate
the
regulatory
takings
analysis,
but
it
does
not
convert
the
regulatory
scheme
into
an
occupation
or
into
physical
invasion.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
particularly
does
not
raise
any
more
serious
constitutional
concerns
here,
with
each
layer
of
regulation
is
designed
to
protect
a
segment
of
the
society
that
is
clearly
requiring
protection
by
the
government
because
they
are
unable
economically
to
protect
themselves.
this
leads
me
to
the
second
flaw
in
the
petitioners'
argument.
and
that
is
that
they
do
not
have
a
legally
protected
property
interest
that
they
claim
to
have
been
taken.
i
heard
counsel
today
indicate
that
there's
an
estate
in
land,
that
there's
a
property
right,
that
there's
a
massive
shift
in
economic
resources.
i
heard
all
of
those
things.
what
i
never
heard
from
him
is
what
it
is
that
was
taken.
what
is
that
property
interest
that
the
state
would
recognize--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
he
has--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
he
has...
he
does
say--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
didn't
understand
him
even
actually
to
have
said
that.
all
i
heard
him
say
was
in
more
general
terms.
i
do
think
it's
fair
to
say
from
his
brief
that
there
has
been
an
argument
that
a
right
to
exclude
from
the
property
is
a
problem.
of
course,
the
difficulty
that
that
poses
is
that
that
same
right
to
exclude
would
create
problems
in
the
civil
rights
laws,
and
yet
he
conceded
quite
plainly
that
at
least
on
an
occupational
theory,
that
those
provisions
are
in
no
sense
placed
into
jeopardy.
and
it's
simply
impossible
to
reconcile
an
argument
that
says
that
those
statutes
are
clearly
permissible,
those
occupations,
in
quote,
not
troublesome
at
all,
and
yet
this
one,
which
involves
simply
sort
of
economic
regulation,
is
suddenly
rendered
a
per
se
unconstitutional
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that's
an
interesting
observation,
justice
scalia,
because
it's
not
clear
to
me
he
really
does
say
that
because
in
response
to
a
number
of
questions
about
what
would
happen
if
that
amount
were
then
controlled
subsequently,
what
would
the
outcome
be.
that
way...
so
there
is
no
transfer
of
money
from
the
mobile
home
owner...
or
mobile
park
owner
to
the
homeowner-tenant.
and
he
said,
well,
that
doesn't
eliminate
the
problem.
so
that's
not
a
central
element
of
the
case
at
some
points.
at
other
points
it
is
a
central
element
of
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
here
a
fairly
slippery
legal
theory.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
reason
you
have
a
slippery
legal
theory
is
that
you're
trying
to
take
what
ought
to
analyzed
under
a
regulatory
takings
theory...
these
are
regulations,
there
may
be
more
than
one,
but
they
are,
at
core,
regulations...
and
trying
to
slip
them
into
an
occupation
theory.
and
the
reason
he
has
to
do
that
is
because
he's
challenged
this
ordinance
on
its
face.
now,
we
can
listen
about
mrs.
morrison,
and
we
certainly
heard
a
lot
about
here
both
here
and
in
briefs
prior
to
this
case,
and
we
can
talk
about
whether
or
not
it's
possible
to
get
out
of
running
a
mobile
park...
mobile
home
park,
and
we
can
talk
about
whether
or
not
the
rents
are
just
and
reasonable.
but
the
truth
is
petitioners
chose
to
bring
their
challenge
facially.
they
chose
to
make
this
an
occupation
or
physical
invasion
case
because
they
require
per
se
condemnation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as...
my
reading
of
their
complaint,
frankly,
is
that
it
is
a
much
more
focused
complaint
than
what
you
described,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
describe
in
fairly
close
detail
the
legal
reasoning
of
the
court
in
hall.
it
follows
in
the
wake
of
hall,
and
it
sounds
very
much
like
hall.
they
had
in
mind
physical
occupation
theory.
but
even
if
they
didn't
abandon
it
at
that
point...
although
it's
still
a
facial
challenge.
it
remains
a
facial
challenge.
there's
no
basis
upon
which
to
go
and
examine
these
property
interests
in
an
individualized
context,
because
there's
no
individual
chain...
individual
claim.
i
mean,
you
can't
say
that
a
statute
that
guarantees
fair,
just,
and
reasonable
rates
is
facially
unconstitutional
because
we
may
not
get
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
with
all
respect,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
an
issue
for
trial.
because
if
the
state
government
or
the
local
government
makes
a
judgment
that
there
are
individuals
within
their
jurisdiction
who
require
protection...
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
initiative
and
ordinance
were
designed
to
accomplish,
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that
part
of
it;
that's
what
it
was
intended
to
accomplish...
it
is
not
the
providence
of
a
jury
years
later
to
conclude,
based
on
economic
theories
propounded
by
the
petitioners
and
their
hired
counsel
to
say
that
the
legislature
was
wrong.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
say
that
it's
not
subject
to
review
by
the
courts.
what
i
say
is
it's
not
subject
to
factual
adjudicatory
review
by
the
courts.
that
is,
the
legislative
judgments
of
course
are
open
for
this
court
to
analyze,
just
as
the
court
has
analyzed
a
whole
host
of
legislative
actions,
and
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
question
is
the
standards.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
means,
the
relationship
between--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
me
to
envision
the
notion
that
a
jury
would
come
back
after
the
fact
and
conclude
that
the
evidence
before
the
legislators
was
insufficient
to
support
the
legislative
judgment
and
that
that's
a
basis
upon
which
to
declare
legislative
acts
unconstitutional.
i
do
agree
with
you
that
under
nollan
and
other
takings
cases
that
look
for
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
means
and
the
ends
chosen,
that
is
subject
to
a
serious
inquiry.
but
again,
that's
not
a
jury's
inquiry;
that
is
for
this
court
to
undertake.
and
therefore,
it
is
appropriate
to
dismiss
a
complaint
at
the
outset
if
that
court
made
the
judgment
that
the
means-ends
relationship
was
adequate.
and
that
analysis,
of
course,
is
subject
to
subsequent
review
by
this
court.
i
have
no
quarrel
about
that.
i
don't
think,
however,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
is
a
jury
issue.
as
read...
as
i
read
williams...
williamson
v.
lee
optical,
justice
douglas
speaking
for
the
court
hypothesized
interests
that
would
not
be
served.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
let
me
say,
as
a
sort
of
initial
matter,
it
is
far
from
clear
to
me
that
the
nollan
issue
has
been
preserved
and
in
this
case
at
all.
this
case
came
up
on
a
physical
occupation
theory,
and
i
don't
perceive
nollan,
which
looks
to
the
substantiality
of
the
state's
interest
and
the
fit
as
part
of
a
physical
occupation
theory.
so
i
interposed
that
objection
initially.
but
as
it
happens,
the
nollan
inquiry
in
this
context
seems
to
me
relatively
simple.
we
have
a
group
of
residents
within
the
city
of
escondido
who
have
placed
a
tremendous
investment.
now
mr.
jagiello
can
demean
that
investment
if
he
chooses
to
by
saying
it's
merely
thousands...
a
few
thousand
dollars
one
way
or
the
other,
but
the
truth
is
for
people
who
are
in
the
average
age
of
64,
a
few
thousand
dollars
is
a
significant
investment,
i
think.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
the
state
takes
that
money?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for
its
own
purposes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
sounds
sort
of
strikingly
like
webb's...
fabulous
pharmacy
to
me,
where
the
interest
of
the
state
is
unrelated
to
the
money
that
it
happens
to
be
taking,
that
it
doesn't
serve
any
purpose,
certainly
not
a
fee,
for
the
benefit
of
providing
the
kind
of
arbitral
arrangement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
is
reasonably
clear
to
me
that
under
nollan
the
state
would
have
to...
well,
i
mean
that's...
that
may
be
close...
that's
a
close
question
under
nollan,
whether
or
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
don't
believe
it's
a
property
interest
that's
being
affected
by
the
regulation
any
more
than
in
the
interpleader
case.
you
say
there's
a
property
interest
that's
being
affected.
there's
an
economic
interest
that's
being
affected.
sure,
there
is
a
transfer
of
wealth.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
takings
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
protected
property
right
that
we
have
to
deal
with
in
a
particular
way.
so
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
it's...
that
the
natural
conclusion
that
you
draw,
justice
kennedy,
follows
from
that
particular
premise.
to
get
back,
justice
scalia,
to
the
nexus.
so
we're
talking--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure.
okay.
that's
no
problem.
the...
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
is
not
simply
the
$2,000
transport
fee
that
costs.
i
mean,
the
truth
is
it's
also
$10,000
to
$15,000
transportation.
but
it's
the
entire
investment
in
their
home
that's
at
risk
at
that
point
in
time.
they
bought
the
home,
they
paid
for
it,
and
now
they're
being
told
by
the
park
owner,
you
can't
go
with
it.
take
your
home
elsewhere
if
you
want
to
leave.
that's
fine.
go
take
that
home.
well,
you
can't
pay
to
take
that
home,
so
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
a
value
that's
whose?
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
you
mean
the
investment
in
his
own
home?
of
course
that's
a
value
that's
his.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
believe,
well,
with
respect.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
this
court
has
in
a
whole
host
of
areas
involving
economic
relationships
held
that
those
economic
relationships
in
order
to
serve
important
state
interests
must
continue
on
beyond
the
terms
of
the
contracts.
i
don't
think
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
at
this
point
that
suddenly
in
this
context
where
it
seems
to
me
the
state's
interest
is,
if
anything,
is
more
substantial
to
protect
these
particular
homeowners,
that
they
cannot
go
on
and
require
this
kind
of
protection.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
maybe
we're
talking
about
two
different
kinds
of
investments.
the
investment
i'm
talking
about
is
the
investment
in
the
mobile
home
and
purchasing
that
home
in
the
first
instance
and
placing
it
into
the
park
and
the
improvements
and
the
investments
in
making
those
improvements.
that
is
sunk-cost
investment
that
a
mobile
home
owner
has
put
down.
now
that
mobile
home
owner
wants
to
leave.
he's
picked
up
a
job
someplace
else,
may
have
passed
away.
in
any
event,
has
no
particular
continuing
interest
in
continuing
to
reside
in
that
mobile
home.
the
problem
at
that
stage
is
the
mobile
home
park
owner
is
in
a
position
to
exploit
that
situation
and
say,
we're
not
going
to
allow
anybody
else
in
here
at
any
reasonable
rental
rate.
which
means
that
the
mobile
home
owner
has
one
of
two
choices.
either
walk
away
from
the
substantial
amount
of
money
they've
placed
into
their
home,
or
agree
to
sell
it
to
the
park
owner
at
a
distress
sale.
and
that
was
as
much
recognized,
frankly,
by
judge
kazinsky's
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuit
that...
as
any
part
of
the
problem.
so
that
is
the
investment
i'm
talking
about.
that
is
the
problem
that
we
need
to
solve.
now
the
question
is
how
do
you
solve
that?
and
do
you
have
to
come
up
with
a
least
restrictive
means
for
solving
that
problem?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no.
the
problem
with
the
theory
there,
of
course,
is
that
there
is
no
frozen
rentals.
the
park
owner
is
always
entitled
to
a
fair,
just,
and
reasonable
rental.
and
if
mrs.
morrison
exercises--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he's
entitled
to
keep
whatever
he
can
get
out
of
the
transaction.
the
fact
that
someone
has
made
a
poor
judgment,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
mrs.
morrison
lived
in
escondido,
it
would
be
a
poor
judgment
to
purchase
a
home
in
a
situation
where
the
landowner...
the
park
owner
remains
free
to
seek
and
obtain
fair,
just,
and
reasonable
increases
in
his
rents
and
to
depart
from
being
a
park
owner
and
thereby
jeopardize
that
portion
of
the
investment.
it
seems
to
me,
that's
just
a
poor
judgment
on
her
part.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
point...
the
question,
as
i
understand
the
takings
clause,
is
not
what
someone
else
is
getting,
the
question
is
what
has
the
park
owner
or
the
landlord
lost.
and
as
i
view
it,
he's
lost
nothing
to
which
he
is
entitled.
he
lost
a
right
to
have...
he's
lost
the
right
to
exploit
rents
above
a
fair,
just,
and
reasonable
level.
but
i
know
of
nothing
in
state
law
that
precludes
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
seems
to
me
a
mistake
to
divorce
the
ultimate
inquiry
of
reasonableness
from
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
takings
clause.
if
what
we're
looking
at
is
not
so
much
worry
about
the
individual
homeowner,
but
the
overall
interrelationships
among
these
parties,
i
don't
see
how
it
become
irrational
simply
to
allow
certain...
to
allow
for
a
certain
windfall.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
any
more
than
it's
irrational...
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
just
as
in
any
kind
of
a
usery
law.
i
mean,
you
have
your
money,
you
are
going
to
go
out
in
the
marketplace
and
obtain
whatever
you
can
as
a
return
on
it.
the
market
allow
you
to
go
however
high
you
are.
but
for
years
it's
been
well
recognized,
i
think,
that
usery
laws
are
perfectly
legitimate
means
by
which
to
regulate
the
relationships
between
those
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
i'd...
what
i
guess
i
have
difficulty
with
is
the
assumption
that
somehow
the
statute
is
in
its
way
designed
to
provide
for
this
huge
windfall.
it
may
be
a
side
consequence
that
in
some
instances,
one
extreme
instance...
that's
the
only
one
that's
been
identified...
there
may
be
some
who
get
a
windfall.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
true.
it's
designed
to
protect
them
because
there
are
other
market
conditions
that
will
restrict
their
relationship
between
the
current
homeowner
and
a
successor
homeowner.
now
that
makes
perfect
sense.
i
don't
see
why
the
legislature
is
not
permitted
to
allow
the
ordinary
market
relationships
between
homeowner-purchaser...
or
homeowner-seller
and
homeowner-purchaser
to
restrict
those
kinds
of
profits
that
you
identify
as
so
worrisome.
i
think
that
that's
a
perfectly
rational
basis
for
the
legislature
to
go.
in
the
landlord-tenant
relationship
the
imbalance
is
so
great
that
some
restraint
has
to
be
placed
on
it.
in
the
homeowner-home
purchaser
relationship
the
market
will
work
in
a
way
that
will
constrain
them.
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
basis
in
any
kind
of
rational
relationship
analysis
or
substantial
nexus
analysis
that
converts
it
back
over
into
the...
into
something
else.
the...
it's
important,
though,
i
think,
having
now
spent
a
fair
amount
of
time
talking
about
nollan
and
having
started
with
the
argument
that
nollan
isn't
really...
i
don't
think...
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
it
was
preserved
below.
cert
petition
doesn't
cite
nollan.
cert
petition
doesn't
cite
penn
central.
i
don't
believe
any
of
that
stuff
is
properly
before
the
court.
to
turn
back
to
the
question
of
physical
occupation,
if
only
to
identify
what
it
seems
to
me
are
the
clear
flaws
in
the
argument
that
mere
regulation
can
be
magically
converted
into
physical
occupation.
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
there
are
four
very
serious
problems
with
petitioners'
basic
argument.
one,
there
is
no
occupation.
the
landlord
decides
to
go
into
the
business
of
offering
these
properties
for
rent.
that
was
his
choice.
he
has
the
choice
to
get
out
of
that
business
if
he
chooses
to
do
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
that
choice
seems
to
me
perfectly
realistic
because
it
has
a
reasonable
notice
requirement
to
allow
the
tenants
to
find
alternative
housing
arrangements.
and
the
only...
the
only
impediments
are
the
ordinary
zoning
and
land
use
restrictions
that
would
otherwise
apply
to
any
property.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
that's...
that
that's
that
serious
an
impediment.
and
the
truth
is
in
most
of
these
cases,
and
it's
true
with
the
appraiser's
report
that
petitioners'
own
appraiser
put
forward,
the
highest
and
best
use
for
this
property,
frankly,
is
as
mobile
home
park.
so
i
don't
think
that's
an
obstacle.
but
at
minimum,
there
is
no
occupation.
second,
this
is
not
a
physical
act.
i
mean,
the
physical
occupation
cases
this
court's
identified
in
the
past...
in
loretto,
you
have
the
hang...
the
wall
mountings
that
are
on
there.
you
can
physically
see
it.
in
pumpali
you
can
see
the
flooding
waters.
those
are
all
physical
acts
that
the
government
authorized
in
one
way
or
another
that
destroyed
the
economic
value.
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
an
animal.
this
is
an
economic
regulation
that
looks
not
like
the
physical
taking.
third,
the
kind
of
trial
that
the
petitioners
call
for
in
this
case
looks
very
different
to
me
than
what
i
would
expect
for
per
se
analysis.
questions
about
what
are
the
property
values,
between
when
you
have
one
set
of
regulatory
arrangements
or
another
set
of
regulatory
arrangements,
and
do
mobile
homes
appreciate
or
depreciate
in
value,
are
not
the
kinds
inquiries
that
i
ordinarily
associate
with
a
per
se
kind
of
analysis.
they
look
like
a
regulatory
type
of
analysis.
and
finally,
i
don't
think
petitioners
have
in
any
way
justified,
at
least
in
my
mind,
why
it
is
that
the
court
would
take
what
has
heretofore
been
a,
i
think,
reasonably
useful
physical
occupation
rule
that
per
se
condemns
certain
activities
and
completely
create
the
same
inexactness
and
uncertainty
that's
necessarily
inherent
in
the
regulatory
takings
doctrine
as
the
court
recognized
in
penn
central.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
in
this
case
at
this
point.
however,
for
the
reasons
that
i
discussed
earlier,
i
believe
there's
no
question
that
at
least
on
a...
certainly
on
a
facial
level
we
would
prevail
on
that
theory.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'd
hope
i
wouldn't
have
to
racing
back
in.
mr.
jagiello
may
be
back--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--on
those
grounds.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
suppose
that's
right.
although
no
one
has,
up
to
now...
no
lower
court
that
has
struck
down
statutes
on
pure
nollan
grounds...
as
i
said,
in
the
court
of
appeal's
most
recent
opinion,
it
analyzed
whether
or
not
the
protection
for
this
specific
homeowner...
satisfied
the
substantial
nexus
test
in
nollan,
and
at
least
that
court
was
prepared
to
hold
that
it
clearly
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that
would
generally
be
the
case,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
facial
challenge
that
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
mean
as
an
unfair--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
that
context,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
one.
but
in
my
context
there
is
one
because
the
difference
here
is
i
have
a
captive
seller...
i
mean,
a
captive
individual.
the
tenant
is
a
captive
trying
to
sell
that
home.
whoever
is
asked
to
come
in
to
purchase
that
home
subsequently
is
not
captive.
there's
a
whole
market
out
there
for
those
people
to
deal
with.
and
that
market
can
constrain
the
amount
that
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
alternatives.
if
a...
if
someone
asks--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
see,
it's
the
choice
of
the
state
to
decide
where
there's
a
problem.
i
think
this
city
is
permitted
to
make
the
choice
that
it
sees
a
more
serious
difficulty
by
a
park
owner
imposing
his
will,
essentially,
on
a
mobile
home
owner
at
the
time
of
sale
than
it
is
worrying
about
whether
the
mobile
home
owner
will
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
in
selling
to
another
market.
there...
to
another
purchaser.
in
that
situation,
there
is
a
whole
wide
range
of
markets
out
there
to
chose
from.
no
one
has
to
buy
a
mobile
home.
once
you
own
a
mobile
home
and
it's
on
a
lot,
you
then
have
that
sunk
investment.
that
difference
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
rational
way
to
distinguish
between
your
cases.
now
your
sublet--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
problem...
but
that's
not...
the
question
here
is
not
the
general
rationality
of
the
price
controls.
the
question
here
is
the
general
rationality
of
distinguishing,
at
least
as
i
understand
your
question,
is
distinguishing
between
the
unique
protections
afforded
to
the
mobile
home
owner
and
the
protections
not
afforded
to
the
mobile
home
seller...
or
the
mobile
home
buyer...
the...
the
second
buyer,
i'm
sorry.
and
my
argument
is
that
their
market
situation
is
very
different.
now,
you
can
say
that
you
don't
think
that
their
market
situation
is
very
different,
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
kind
of
legislative
judgment
that
traditionally,
at
least,
this
court
has
been
extremely
deferential
to.
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
was
in
this
case,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
