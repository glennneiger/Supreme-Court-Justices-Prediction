justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
it's
not
absolute,
is
it?
i
mean,
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
if
he
has
reason
to
believe
or
reason
to
prove...
the
basis
to
prove
that
the
new
tenant
probably
won't
or
cannot
pay
the
rent,
or
won't
otherwise
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
park.
so
it's
not
an
absolute
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
it
would
still
be
a
taking,
even
if
under
the
rental
agreement
the
tenant
as
a
matter
of
contract
could
not
sell
for
more
than
the
blue
book
value
when
the
tenant
left.
you'd
still
say
there
was
a
taking
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
the
only
relevant
provision
were
the
limitacion
on
sale
price
to
blue
book
value,
other
things
being
equal?
other
things
being
equal
to
what
you've
alleged,
would
you
still
say
there
was
a
taking?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
presume
the
tenant
can
do
exactly
what
the
tenant
can
do
now,
except
the
tenant
cannot
reap
the
windfall.
