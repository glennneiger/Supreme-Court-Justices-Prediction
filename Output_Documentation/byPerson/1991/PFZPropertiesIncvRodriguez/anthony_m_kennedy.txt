justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
this
substantive
due
process
inquiry
does
not
depend
upon
any
showing
that
there
was
a
taking
of
property?
and
by
that
i
mean
a
taking
of
the
real
property
that
is
in
question.
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
inverse
condemnation
can
sometime
arise
from
improper
governmental
action,
under
the
takings
clause?
justice
kennedy
what
is
your
best
case
for
the
proposition
that
the
bad
faith
manipulation
of
procedural
processes
constitutes
a
substantive
violation?
justice
kennedy
but
what's
your
best
case
from
this
court,
if
there
is
one,
indicating
that
that
kind
of
manipulation
constitutes
not
a
procedural
due
process
violation
but
a
substantive
due
process
violation?
justice
kennedy
well,
based
on
that
statement,
what
is
your,
what's
the
clearest
authority
from
this
court
that
supports
your
position?
justice
kennedy
weren't
those
all
cases
where
the
allegation
was
that
there
was
a
taking
under
the
takings
clause?
