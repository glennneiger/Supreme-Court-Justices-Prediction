ms.
vanessa
ramirez
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
my
exposition
going
back
to
what
justice
souter
was
asking
mr.
richichi.
this
case
from
the
very
beginning
has
dealt
with
his
claim,
with
petitioner's
claim
that
he
has
a
property
interest
in
a
construction
permit.
it
has...
if
we
look
at
the
record
of
the
case
all
throughout
the
briefings,
from
the
district
court
on
to
the
court
of
appeals,
never
ever
did
petitioner
rely
on
these
zoning
cases
from
the
beginning
of
the
century.
there
is
no
mention
of
nectow,
no
mention
of
the
roberge
case,
no
mention
of
village
of
euclid.
this
has
always
been
considered
by
both
courts
below
as
a
claim
that
the
denial
of
a
construction
permit
violated
both
his
due
process
right,
procedural
due
process
right,
his
rights
to
substantive
due
process,
and
his
equal
protection
rights.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
amended
complaint
that
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
he
is
arguing
anything
other
than
he
has
a
right
to
a
construction
permit.
and
our
position
is
that
he
has
not
cited
to
any
statute
or
any
regulation
or
any
provision
in
puerto
rico
law
to
demonstrate,
that
is
he
has
not
pressed
the
argument
that
because
he
did
as
the
statute
provided
he
was
anywhere
near
the
moment
where
he
could
get
a
permit.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
well,
it
is
not
correct
as
a
matter
of
law,
your
honor.
the
only...
i
don't
have
it
in
my
memory
what
issue
he
was
citing
in
the
reply
brief.
of
course
this
is
after
we
made
a
comment
in
our
respondents'
brief
that
he
had
not
pressed
an
argument
that
he
could
derive
the
property
interest
from
state
law.
and
he
is
citing
to
what
he
calls
history,
history
of
the
statute.
but
the
only,
conceivably
the
only
statute
in
puerto
rico,
the
only
disposition
of
positive
law
that
he
could
rely
on
is
the
one
that
was
examined
by
the
district
court
in
opinion
and
order,
it
is
page
481
in
the
joint
appendix.
it
says
arpe
shall
issue
the
corresponding
permit
based
on
the
compliance
with
the
regulation
provided
in
this
section,
and
that
is
23
puerto
rico
laws
annotated,
section
42c.
again
our
argument
is
we
have
to
indulge
the
petitioner
with
all
favorable
inferences
that
will
derive,
reasonably
derive
from
his
pleadings,
because
the
procedural
stance
of
the
case
will
be
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
he,
the
petitioner
has
studiously
avoided
to
recite
the
facts
of
what
happened
after
he
made
an
original
submission
of
plans
to
arpe.
the
complaint
has
a
chronological
recitation
of
facts
coming
from
the
planning
board,
which
is
a
different
agency,
but
when
he
goes
to
arpe
and
he
gets
preliminary
approval
for
effect
of
construction
drawings
he
does
not,
there
are
no
allegations
from
which
we
could
derive
the
idea
that
the
permit
process
was
somehow
so
far
along
or
he
has
progressed
through
the
progressive
steps
so
that
arpe
would
have
no
discretion
to
withhold
the
permit.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position
and
in
our
brief
in
response,
respondents'
brief,
this
is,
we
cited
to
the
precise
statutory
provisions
that
should
indicate
to
the
court
that
arpe
is
a
separate
agency.
the
planning
board
will
approve
the
use
of
land
for,
of
undeveloped
land
for
certain
purposes.
it
gives
out
the
site
permits.
but
arpe
has
been
delegated
with
all
the
powers
to
decide
how
you
are
going
to
subdivide
your
land,
the
subdivision
part,
which
is
where
construction
drawings
get
into.
you
have
to
subdivide
your
lands
in
such
a
way,
and
this
is
why
you
require
arpe
to
require
the
endorsements
of
so
many
public
bodies,
so
many
commonwealth
agencies.
and
the
reason
this
project
has
not
gotten
off
the
ground
is
because
the
petitioner
refuses
to
comply
with
arpe
manual
of
procedures
which
says
you
must
bring
construction
drawings
approved
by
all
the,
endorsed
by
all
the
pertinent
agencies.
and
one
of
these
agencies
is
the
environmental
quality
board
who
has
been
asking
since
1974
for
the
filing
of
an
environmental
impact
statement.
and
petitioner
refuses
to
do
it
because
he
believes
that
once
he
got
approval
to
develop
the
land
in
that
site
among
the
manuals
he
does
not
have
to
comply
with
that.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
i
agree
that
the
court
below,
although
it
was
very
skeptical
that
the
petitioner
had
acquired
an
entitlement
to
the
permit
protected
under
the
due
process
clause,
they
assumed
for
all
purposes
of
the
argument
that--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--what
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--i
defend
it,
your
honor,
because
something
more
than
an
allegation
of
a
5-year
delay
must
be
shown,
must
be
shown,
because
otherwise
this
is
how
a
substantive
due
process
is
so
marvelous--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--everything
becomes
constitutional.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
state
law,
yes.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
the
standard
which
the
first
circuit
was
using
is
one
that
this
is
not
enough.
something
more
is
needed
than
merely
an
allegation
that
they
have
illegally
departed
from
state
law
or
state
procedures.
and
i
defend
that
standard.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
oh,
yes,
but
this
is
because
they
assume
the
property
interest.
the
opinion
from
the
court
below
also
did
the
same.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
the
court
could
do
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
the
problem
is
that
when
this
case
comes
to
this
court
it
is
different.
it
is
no
longer
the
construction
permit
itself,
although
that
is
the
precise
question
in
which
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
it
comes
now
with
a
claimed
right
recognized
by
this
court
in
early
zoning
decisions
that
says
that
the
landowner
has
a
right
to
develop
his
land
to
any
legitimate
use.
now,
our
view
now
is
that
as
far
as
petitioner
is
relying
on
those
zoning
cases
for
that
proposition,
it
is
because
he
is
trying
to
supply
the
deficiencies
in
the
pleading
which
should
have
been
where
are
the
statutory
provisions
in
puerto
rico
or
the
positive
law
from
where
i
can
show
the
court
that
i
derived
a
right
to
a
construction
permit.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that...
yes,
we
are
defending
the
standard
from
the
policy
of
u.s.
courts,
but
this
is
because
they
assumed
the
existence
of
the
property
interest.
it
is
correct.
the
thing
is--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
go
beyond
the
pleadings.
it
limited
itself
to
the
allegations
in
the
amended
complaint,
and
it,
there's
a
footnote
on
page
1
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
says
we
know
that
the
district
court
went
beyond
the
pleadings
and
got
into
the
pretrial
facts,
but
we
are
not
going
to
go
beyond
that.
so
the
claim
that
is
here
before
the
court
arises
from
paragraph
37
in
the
amended
complaint,
and
that's
page
1137
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
to
that
effect
both
courts
assumed
that
there
had
been
what
could
be
called
an
undue
delay
because
the
plans
had
been
filed
6
years
ago.
but
there
is
nothing
about
pretextual
review,
nothing
about
political
considerations
or
improper
motives.
none
of
that
is
pleaded
in
the
amended
complaint.
and
if
we're
going
to
use
the
standard
of
review
that
requires
us
to
look
at
the
proprietary
of
the
granting
of
a
motion
in
our
favor
under
12(b)(6),
we
are
asking
the
court
to
limit
itself
to
the
amended
complaint,
the
allegations.
and
finally
as
a
matter
of
law
they
raise
the
substantive
due
process
claim.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
your
honor,
substantive
due
process,
if
it
is
conduct
that
shocks
the
conscience,
a
5-year
delay
i
would
say
does
not
shock
the
conscience.
it
is
so
open.
it
is
so--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--within
the
substantive
due
process
context,
but
the
petitioner
was
mentioning
the
ewing
case,
regents
of
university
v.
ewing,
and
this
is
the
case
that
most
closely
resembles
our
case
in
the
sense
that
because
we're
not
dealing
here
with
application
of
a
means-ends
analysis
to
a
piece
of
legislation,
which
was
what
was
involved
in
the
zoning
cases,
what
do
you
have?
you
have
somebody
who
is
unsatisfied
with
an
adjudication,
and
the
only
case
that
comes
to
my
memory
is
this
regents
case,
the
ewing
case,
where
this
court,
and
i
believe
the
decision
was
unanimous,
the
court
unanimously
assumed
the
property
interest
in
the
continued
enrollment
in
the
medical
program,
then
went
on
to
assume
that
there
was
a
substantive
due
process
claim,
that
that
kind
of
property
qualified
for
protection
under
the
substantive
compartment
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
they
turned
the
case
into
a
procedural
one.
it
is
judicial
review
to
see
whether
there
are
facts
that
would
reasonably
support
the
decision
that
was
made
so
that
it
cannot
be
called
arbitrary.
so
if
there
is
a
case
where
substantive
due
process
and
procedural
due
process
overlap,
this
will
be
the
case.
this
will
be
the
case.
he
would
need
an
adjudication
to
be
satisfied
that
what
happened
was
not
arbitrary,
that
there
was
some
grounds
for
the
decision,
and
the
problem
is
that
he
did
not
get
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
so
they
deprived,
the
courts
of
puerto
rico
did
not
give
him
a
change
to
appeal
on
the
merits
because
they
denied
discretionary
review,
which
does
not
mean
that
he
doesn't
have
other
adequate
state
remedies.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
well,
he
does.
he
can
go
into
court--
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
--he
has
tort
damages,
and
accuse
mr.
rodriguez.
the
only
person
here,
the
only
respondent
here
is
mr.
rodriguez.
the
allegations
have
been
going
on
that
there
is
this
conspiracy
at
arpe,
that
high
level
officials
were
involved.
the
only
respondent
here
is
mr.
rodriguez.
and
all
of
the
pleadings
in
the
complaint
even
sound
like
respondent
superior,
that
he
should
answer
because
he
was
arpe's
chief,
which
is
a
defense
that
we
promoted
in
the
courts
below.
we
really
don't...
what
he,
what
petitioner
is
proposing
now
would
throw
away
what
we
understand
has
been
the
analysis
that
this
court
does
when
it
is
presented
with
a
substantive
due
process
claim.
you
need
to
find
a
fundamental
interest,
you
need
to
allege
an
interest
that
is
fundamental
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
liberty
interest
either
deeply
rooted
in
the
nation's
history
or
tradition
or
because
it
is
implied
in
the
concept
of
order
liberty.
petitioner
is
admitting
that
it
does
not
have
a
fundamental
interest.
this
he
admitted
in
his
brief.
now
in
his
reply
brief
at
page
11,
note
19
he
admits
that
he
does
not
have
a
liberty
interest.
so
what
do
we
have?
is
this
the
kind
of
property
interest
that
qualifies
for
substantive
due
process
protection?
why
should
he
rely
on
the
court's
early
zoning
decisions?
it
would
be
axiomatic
to
say
that
a
landowner
has
a
right
to
use
his
land
or
devote
it
to
any
legitimate
use.
that's
only
axiomatic.
the
court
did
say,
though,
they
say
that,
but
it
was
said
in
another
context
when
you
were,
when
the
court
was
examining,
according
to
the
economic
due
process
substantive
theories,
the
substance
of
legislation,
the
substance
of
an
ordnance,
the
substance
of
a
piece
of
legislation,
and
saying
well,
it
is
or
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
so
he
has
the
court
already
doing
a
referendum
for
his
property
right.
the
court
has
already
said
it,
and
i
would
be
in
an
awful
position
if
i
would
have
to
argue
to
your
honors
that
the
court
has
never
recognized
a
property
interest
in
a
landowner's
desire
or
wish
to
devote
his
land
to
any
legitimate
use.
so
there
must
be
something
else
involved
here.
and
if
we
don't
have
a
fundamental
interest
and
if
he
doesn't
have
a
liberty
interest
which
has
been
qualifying
for
protection
under
the
due
process
clause,
then
i
don't
know
what
he
has
unless
it
is
a
claim
that
there
has
been
a
wrongful
adjudication
of
his
claim,
which
sounds
to
me
like
procedural
due
process.
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
ms.
vanessa
ramirez
thank
you,
your
honors.
