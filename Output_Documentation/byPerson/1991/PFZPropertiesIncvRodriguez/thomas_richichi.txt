mr.
thomas
richichi
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
matter
before
you
involves
the
deprivation
of
a
landowner's
right
to
pursue
a
use
of
his
property,
a
use
which
was
approved
more
than
15
years
ago
by
the
planning
board
of
puerto
rico
and
upheld
on
the
merits
by
the
puerto
rican
courts.
the
deprivation
occurred
in
august
of
1988
when
senior
officials
of
the
puerto
rican
permits
authority,
that
is
the
respondent
arpe,
denied
pfz
a
construction
permit
and
dismissed
its
project.
pfz
alleges
that
the
dismissal
is
actionable
under
42
usc
section
1983
and
that
it
deprived
pfz
of
a
protected
interest
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
it
was
a
result
of
behavior
by
officials
acting
under
color
of
state
law
which
was
not
rationally
leaded
to
a
legitimate
state
objective.
the
conduct
which
gave
rise
to
pfz's
claim
was
the
deliberate
refusal
by
arpe
to
review
and
process
a
set
of
construction
drawings
which
pfz
had
submitted
to
the
agency
in
order
to
obtain
a
construction
permit.
this
was
accompanied
by
the
dismissal
of
arpe's
project
based
on
the
deliberate
review
of
another
different
set
of
drawings
which
arpe
knew
to
be
the
wrong
drawings.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that's
correct.
we
are
here
under
12(b)(6).
mr.
thomas
richichi
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
richichi
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
well
settled
law
that
the
pretrial
order
acts
as
an
amendment
to
the
original
amended
complaint
and
is
in
effect
a
pleading
in
and
of
itself.
we
raised
that
issued
on
a
rehearing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
it
said
that
because
that
issue
had
not
been
raised
originally
in
the
briefs
before
the
court
that
it
was
not
going
to
consider
that
in
its
determination.
however,
it
said
in
the
alternative
that
had
it
looked
at
the
pretrial
order
that
its
opinion
would
not
have
changed.
i
think
the
court
is
free
to
consider
the
pretrial
order
if
it
deems
that
it
in
fact
has
amended
the
complaint
in
connection
with
the
well
settled
law.
we
do
not
think
you
need
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
rule
in
our
favor.
mr.
thomas
richichi
well,
the
pretrial
order...
we
would
rely
on
the
amended
complaint,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
pretrial
order
does
reflect
the
state
of
the
record
when
the
case
was
dismissed,
and
therefore
in
drawing
reasonable
inferences
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
we
believe
that
it
is
context
and
does
provide
guidance
as
to
what
reasonable
inferences
were
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
richichi
some
of
the
facts
that
we
have
relied
upon
are
reflected
in
the
pretrial
order.
they
are
also
reflected
in
the
admissions
that
have
been
made
in
the
papers
before
this
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
believe
the
amended
complaint
is
sufficient
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
thomas
richichi
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
these
facts
are
reflected
in
the
amended
complaint
and
the
reasonable
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
therefrom.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
do
not
believe
the
pretrial
order
was
made
part
of
the
appendix
by
the
parties.
mr.
thomas
richichi
right.
pfz
had
timely
filed
the
required
drawings
in
february
of
1982
for
arpe's
processing
and
review.
arpe
did
not
act
on
the
drawings
until
6
years
later,
and
then
only
after
pfz
had
sued
the
agency.
reviewing
the
wrong
drawings,
senior
arpe
officials
concluded,
6
years
after
the
fact,
that
pfz
had
not
submitted
any
construction
drawings
in
1982
and
having
missed
the
deadline
for
submission
the
entire
project
would
be
dismissed.
pfz
submits
that
this
deliberate
action
cannot
be
construed
to
be
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
richichi
we
requested
that
the
court
review
this
case
because
of
the
procedural
due
process
violations
that
we
have
alleged
below.
the
court
declined
to
accept
that
issue,
so
we
are
here
on
the
substantive
due
process
issues.
but
yes,
we
alleged
procedural--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--we
believe
that
there
is
a
property
right
that
is
protected
and
falls
within
the
due
process
component--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--the
property--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--i
would
articulate
it
differently,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
richichi
yes,
there
is.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
was
cite...
the
law
that
was
cited
was
in
our
reply
brief
at
note
5,
page
4,
and
it
indicates
that
when
the
planning
board
has
acted
and
approved
a
project
there
is
a
vested
right
that
accrues,
that's
23
laws
of
puerto
rico
annotated,
section
71.
i
believe
the
full
citation
is
in
our
brief
at
note
5,
page
4.
the
planning
board,
having
made
the
policy
determination
that
the
use
was
approved,
the
ministerial
function
of
the
permitting
agency
was
to
issue
the
permit
and
effectuate
that
use.
if
the
permit
was
not
issued,
then
the
rights
that
were
granted
by
the
planning
board
had
no
effect.
therefore,
in
answer
to
your
question,
in
this
particular
circumstance
we
would
say
that
there
is
a
property
right.
we
would
also--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--yes.
the...
if
the
required
drawings
are--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--that
is
correct.
in
fact
i
would
point
out
that
under
the
current
regulations
and
current
law,
as
the
respondents
point
out
in
their
brief,
these
drawings
are
not
even
reviewed
before
a
permit
is
issued
by
the
agency,
although
the
agency
does
reserve
that
right
to
do
it
on
a
spot
basis.
but
the
task
is
such
that
the
agency
no
longer
even
reviews
these
drawings.
the
engineer
just
certifies
that
they
are
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
richichi
justice
o'connor,
if
we're
talking
about
a
taking
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--i'm
sorry.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
justice
kennedy,
i
was
thinking
of
my
answer.
the
due
process
clause
is
distinct
from
the
takings
clause
and
we
would
submit
that
in
this
particular
instance
there
are
two
different
potential
claims.
the
one
that
has
been
asserted
is
the
due
process
claim,
the
difference
being
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
first
english
opinion,
takings
involves
otherwise
proper
conduct
by
the
government
which
interferes
with
property.
here
we
are
talking
about
misconduct,
and
in
that
sense
we
do
not
believe
that
the
complaint
that
we
have
alleged
involves
a
takings
claim.
not
that
one
couldn't
be
presented,
but
under
these
circumstances
we
are
talking
about
misconduct
and
that
implicates
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
thomas
richichi
the
court
has
said
that,
in
the
takings
context,
that
sometimes
regulation
can
go
too
far
if
there
is
an
improper
exercise
of
the
police
power.
but
i
think
the
court
has
also
made
clear
that
there
can
be
an
improper
exercise
of
the
police
power
with
respect
to
a
substantive
due
process
claim,
and
in
this
particular
instance
we
believe
that
there
was
an
improper
exercise
of
the
police
power
in
an
adjudicatory
setting
and
that
implicates
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
think
the...
as
i
recall
the
opinion,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
they
were
assuming
the
existence
of
the
property
right,
and
even
assuming
the
existence
of
the
property
right
under
puerto
rican
law
that
they
did
not
feel
that
there
was
a
claim
that
had
been
stated.
so
as
far
as
the
court
below
was
concerned,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
the
existence
of
a
property
right.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
is...
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
was
that
specific,
but
i
have
to
assume
that
that's
what
they're
referring
to
when
they
said
we
assume
the
existence
of
a
property
right.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
think
the
only
issue
is
the
latter,
if
there
was
a
property
right,
was
it
taken.
this
court
has
said
in
the
state
of
washington
v.
roberge
that
the
right
to
devote
one's
land
to
a
legitimate
use
is
property
within
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
the
court
has
more
recently
said
in
the
nollan
case
that
the
right
to
build
on
one's
property
is
not
even
remotely
something
along
the
lines
of
a
government
benefit,
that
there
is
a
right
to
build
on
one's
property.
and
that
one
arose
in
the
constitutional
context.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
is
exactly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
protected
right
here
at
issue
derives
from
the
ownership
of
the
land
since
the
right
to
use
the
land
is
one
of
the
most
basic
sticks
in
the
bundle
of
land
ownership.
the...
puerto
rico,
in
the
statutes
that
we
have
cited,
recognizes
the
right
to
build
on
one's
property
and
recognizes
the
right
to
make
use
of
one's
property.
mr.
thomas
richichi
it
is
the
right
that
you
have
described,
the
underlying
right
to
use
one's
property.
what
i
was
pointing
out
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
inquiry
was
that
there
is
also
a
property
right
under
puerto
rican
law.
but
the
right
upon
which
we
rely
is
the
underlying
right
to
use
one's
land--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--and
we
believe
that
the
court
has
indicated
that
is
within
the
protection
due
process
clause.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
think
it
goes
to
more
than
delay,
because
there
was
a
denial
of
the
permit
after
a
legitimate
use
had
been
recognized.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
believe
we
do
indicate,
if
the
court
needs
to
go
that
far
we
did
indicate
that
the
required
drawings
had
been
submitted
such
that
a
permit
could
issue.
so
to
the
extent--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--we
believe
we
should
prevail
on
both
rights,
that's
correct.
if
it's
the
right
that
you
have
identified
or
if
it's
the
right
that
justice
o'connor
has
identified,
be
believe
they
are
both
present
in
this
instance.
and
we
would
submit
that
in
using
or
making
use
of
the
land
that
puerto
rico
can
subject
us
to
legitimate
restrictions
under
the
police
power,
but
that
police
power
is
in
and
of
itself
subject
to
legitimate
restrictions
that
have
been
recognized
under
the
due
process
clause,
and
that
in
fact
is
where
we
believe
the
right
has
arisen,
and
we
believe--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--yes.
mr.
thomas
richichi
well,
in
response
to
that
question
we
believe
that
this
court
has
indicated
under
zinermon
that
the
federal
remedy
is
supplementary
so
that
we
are
not
required
in
the
substantive
due
process
context
to
first
make
use
of
state
remedies,
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
the
appropriate
rule.
i
believe
one
circuit
has--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--yes,
we
did,
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
richichi
we
sought
reconsideration
before
the
agency
advising
them,
as
the
court
below
said
unequivocally,
that
they
had
reviewed
the
wrong
drawings.
the
agency
proceeded
to
review
the
exact
same
wrong
drawings
and
affirm
its
opinion.
we
then
sought
discretionary
review
before
the
puerto
rican
courts
of
that
administrative
decision,
and
the
puerto
rican
courts
declined
to
exercise
their
discretionary
review.
so
we
did
have
a
final
decision.
we
sought
administrative
reconsideration,
that
was
denied--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--that
was
a
different
circumstance.
yes,
we
did.
previously
we
had
been
to
the
supreme
court
with
respect
to
the
planning
board
approval
and
the
supreme
court
approved
the
planning
board's
approval,
and
that
was
some
10
years
before.
this
matter
has
been,
we
have
been
seeking
to
develop
and
pursue
this
property
for
almost
30
years
now.
mr.
thomas
richichi
no.
we
could
not
have
won
because
the
record
was
corrupted.
the
puerto
rican
courts
exercise
discretionary
review
which
only
looks
to
issues
of
law,
excepting
the
administrative
record,
on
the
basis
of
what
has
been
presented
by
the
agency.
in
that
particular
circumstance
the
agency
looked
at
the
wrong
drawings
and
said
these
are
the
correct
drawings.
it
is
undisputed
that
they
cannot
be--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--we
did
bring
an
action
in
the
puerto
rican
court
asking
them
to
exercise
their
discretionary
review.
mr.
thomas
richichi
the,
it
is...
i
would
compare
the
procedure
to
petitioning
for
certiorari
before
this
court
and
it
being
denied.
there
is
nothing
indicated,
just
the
case
is
not
going
to
be
heard.
that's
its
discretionary
review,
and
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
decision
that
was
rendered.
we
believe
that,
as
i
have
mentioned,
that
the
court
in
the
land
use
context,
going
back
as
far
as
the
seminal
decision
in
euclid
and
related
cases,
nectow
and
the
state
of
washington
v.
roberge
which
we
have
cited,
has
recognized
that
the
use
of
one's
property,
one's
land
specifically
in
this
instance,
is
something
which
falls
within
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
we
believe
it
is--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--justice
o'connor,
we
do
not
allege
that
any
property
has
been
taken.
we
have
alleged
that
a
property
right
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
has
been
deprived.
again
i
would
draw
the
distinction
between
the
taking
and
the
deprivation,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--no,
it
is
not
an
absolute
right.
it
is
a
right
to
pursue
a
legitimate
use
which
is
subject
to
reasonable
restrictions
under
the
police
power.
when
the
planning
board
exercised
its
discretion--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--i
would
respectfully
disagree.
we
could
have...
in
this
particular
instance
we
could
have
had
all
the
due
process,
procedural
due
process
we
wanted.
if
they
continued
to
look
at
the
wrong
drawings
and
decided
to
act
as
arbitrarily
as
they
did
and
to
say
we're
looking
at
this
and
it
is
something
other
than
what
it
is,
all
the
procedural
due
process,
all
the
hearings
in
the
world
ultimately
would
not
have
helped
us.
what
we're
complaining
about
here
is
an
act
of
deprivation.
we
had
a
right
which
had
been
recognized
by
the
planning
board
to
develop
that
property.
it
was
upheld
by
the
puerto
rican
courts
on
the
merits,
and
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court.
when
we
went
to
the
ministerial
agency
and
said
here
are
the
required
drawings
and
we,
that's
as
we
have
alleged
in
the
complaint,
the
agency,
under
its
directive,
was
to
review
those
and
if
they
were
the
required
drawings
it
was
to
issue
the
permit.
mr.
thomas
richichi
puerto
rico
certainly
could
have
enacted
legislation
to
do
that.
the
governor
is
empowered
under
certain
circumstances
to
exercise
his
emergency
powers
if
he
thinks
there
is
a
danger
to
the
public.
and
in
this
particular
instance
the
legislature
neither
acted
nor
did
the
governor
exercise
his
emergency
powers.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
would
have
required
otherwise
proper
conduct,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
this
court
said,
and
that
is
not
what
was
present
here.
if
puerto
rico
wants
to
take
that
property
they
certainly
can
do
it
by
legitimate
means.
however,
what
happened
here
were
that
senior
officials
acted
arbitrarily
and
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
with
what
can
only
be
believed
to
be
bad
faith,
and
denied
us
a
permit.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
think
there
is
bad
faith
manipulation
of
procedures
in
this
case
because
puerto
rico
did
not--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--i
would
return
to
my
response
to
justice
o'connor's
inquiry
which
i
think
was
the
same.
no
matter
what
procedures
were
provided,
in
this
particular
circumstance
we
were
not
going
to
get
a
permit
because
they
were
going
to
look
at
the
wrong
drawings
and
say
that
you
had
never
submitted
the
correct
drawings.
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
procedure.
the,
this
is
perhaps
the
easiest
case
and
the
most
blatant
case
of
arbitrary
conduct
to
understand.
they
simply
refused
to
look
at
what
was
in
front
of
them
and
called
it
something
else.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
think
this
court
has
laid
out
the
standard
for
evaluating
that
quite
clearly
in
ewing.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i
think
ewing
lays
out
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
that
particular
instance,
and
the
euclid,
nectow,
and
state
of
washington
cases
all,
state
of
washington
v.
roberge,
all
recognize
that
there
is
a
protected
interest
within
the
due
process
clause.
ewing
was
an
8
to
1
decision
by
this
court
in
which
it
laid
out
the
standards,
and
it
indicated
that
bad
faith,
the
lack
of
a
genuine
decision
i
think
was
at
the
heart
of
the
court's
decision
there,
and
i
think
that
is
present
here
without
a
doubt.
there
was
not
a
genuine
decision--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--no,
ewing
was
a,
specifically
a
case
in
which
this
court
assumed
that
there
was
a
substantive
due
process
protected
property
interest,
and
in
that
case
what
the
court
said
was
there
is,
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
decision,
the
adjudicatory
decision
was
genuine,
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
it's
in
good
faith,
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
judgment
was
in
fact
exercised
by
the
decision-makers,
then
you
would
have,
you
would
meet
the
test
for
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i'm
sorry,
it's
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
michigan
v.
ewing.
i
apologize,--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
richichi
i'm
looking
in
the
brief.
mr.
thomas
richichi
it
is
a
case
which--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--with
the
court's
indulgence.
i
am
sorry.
it's
principally...
i
apologize
to
the
court.
it's
regents
of
the
university
of
michigan--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--and
it
is
a
principally
relied
upon
case
we
have
cited
passim
throughout
the
brief.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
is
the
case
that
we
would
point
out,
we
would
point
to
which
establishes
the
standard.
just
briefly,
if
i
can
describe
ewing,
there
the
court
assumed
the
existence
of
a
property
interest.
it
was
a
claim
that
there
was
a
right
to
university
enrollment,
and
i
think
what
the
court
says,
we
don't
know
if
that
rises
to
the
level
of
due
process,
but
we
will
present
the
standard.
and
we
think
we
fit
within
that
standard.
mr.
thomas
richichi
this
is
the
administrator
of
the
agency
who
is
no
longer
there,
there
is
a
gentleman
also
who
was
the
regional
administrator
who
is
now
the
deputy
administrator,
and
certain
other
assistant
administrators,
all
senior
officials
of
arpe.
mr.
thomas
richichi
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
correctly,
i
believe
we
would,
because
the
remedy
under
the
due,
under
section
1983
is
supplementary,
it
is
not
derivative,
and
therefore
if
in
fact
there
has
been
misconduct,
and
this
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
1983
was
intended
to
prevent,
if
there
has
been
misconduct
by
the
state
and
you
can't
get
a
fair
hearing
within
the
state,
then
you
have
access
to
the
federal
remedy.
so--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--i
understand--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--no.
mere
mistakes,
errors
in
judgment,
or
where
there
is
not
some
deliberate
attempt
to
deprive
us
of
the
right
through
an
arbitrary,
through
arbitrary
means
not
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
purpose--
mr.
thomas
richichi
--under
those
circumstances,
if
it's
a
mistake
or
a
good
faith
error
or
some
misjudgment,
then
i
don't
think
we
would
have
stated
a
due
process
claim.
mr.
thomas
richichi
that
would
be
part
of
it,
but
we
were
denied...
there
was
a
decision
by
the
agency
denying
us
a
use.
i
don't
know
if
i
would
look
to
the
appeal
as
where
the
action,
the
complained
of
action
occurred.
