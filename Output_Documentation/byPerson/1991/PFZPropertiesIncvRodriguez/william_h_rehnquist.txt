v.
rene
alberto
rodriguez,
et
al.--
mr.
richichi.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
richichi,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
where
you're
drawing
your
facts
from.
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
therefore,
ordinarily
we
would
take
the
well
pleaded
facts
in
the
complaint.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
a
pretrial
order
entered,
was
there
not,
specifying--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
whether
that
order
may
be
relied
on
or
not
for
facts
in
deciding
the
legal
questions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
are
now
drawing
your
statement
of
facts
that
you
make
to
us,
then,
from
the
pretrial
order
as
well
as
from
the
complaint?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
not
to
me
an
entirely
satisfactory
answer
to
my
question.
you're
stating
that
certain
facts
happened.
the
planning
board
deliberately
read
the
wrong
set
of
plans.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
all
of
that
derived
simply
from
the
amended
complaint,
or
are
you
relying
at
least
in
part
on
the
pretrial
order?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
a
claim,
but
when
you
give
us
these
statement
of
facts
are
you
relying
on
anything
that
can
only
be
divined
from
the
pretrial
order?
well,
don't--
chief
justice
rehnquist
as
i
recall
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
this
case,
they
did
not
agree
with
you
as
to
your
submission
as
to
the
law
of
puerto
rico,
that
that
law
was
so
flat
out
ministerial
that
it
would,
that
you
had
a
substantive
right
to
a
permit
once
your
development
project
had
gotten
to
the
stage
it
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
the
type
of
property
right
which
justice
o'connor
questioned
you
about,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
stated
that
flatly,
that
there
is
a
right
to
build
on
one's
property,
i
mean
you
have
to
add
any
number
of
qualifications
to
that.
there
is
not
a
right
to
build
an
8-story
office
building
on
property
that's
zoned
for
a
single-family
residence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
have
required
a
taking
of,
a
condemnation
of
your
land
if
they're
going
to
turn
it
into
a
wildlife
reserve.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
mr.
richichi,
you
have
been
asked
to
cite
a
particular
case,
what
is
your
best
case.
you
have
been
asked
three
times
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
name
of
the
other
party
in
the
ewing
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it
isn't
cited
in
the
table
of
authorities.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
it
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
your
best
case
and
it's
not
cited?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
regents.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richichi.
ms.
ramirez,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
ramirez,
this
perhaps
follows
up
on
justice
white's...
the
sentence,
the
last
sentence
in
the
court
of
appeals'
treatment
of
the
substantive
due
process
claim
says
even
assuming
that
arpe
engaged
in
delaying
tactics
and
refused
to
issue
permits
for
the
vacia
talega
project
based
on
considerations
outside
the
scope
of
its
jurisdiction
under
puerto
rico
law,
such
practices
without
more
do
not
raise
to
the
level
of
violations
of
the
federal
constitution
under
a
substantive
due
process
label.
so,
if
we're
going
to
review
that
judgment
we
have
to
make
the
same
assumptions
that
the
court
of
appeals
did,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
ramirez.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
second
case,
no.
91-122,
pfz

versus
rene
alberto
rodriguez,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
