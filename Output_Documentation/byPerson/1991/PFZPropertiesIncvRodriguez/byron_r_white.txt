justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
actually
said
more
than
that.
it
said
it
isn't
all
that
clear
whether
there's
a
property
right
or
not
under
puerto
rican
law.
justice
white
and
do
you
suppose
that,
do
you
suppose
the...
is
it
open
in
this
court?
is
the
question
open
in
this
court
as
to
whether
there
is
a
property
right
under
puerto
rican
law
in
the
construction
permit,
or
do
we
have
to...
is
the
only
issue
before
us
is
if
there
is
a
property
right,
was
it
taken?
justice
white
but
you
did
resort
to
state
remedies,
didn't
you?
justice
white
and
you
were
turned
down.
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
an
argument
that
you're
making
now.
the
court
of
appeals
said
well,
let's
just,
we'll
just
assume
that
there
is
a
property
interest--
justice
white
--in
this
construction
permit.
nevertheless,
there
is
no
denial
of,
there
is
no
substantive
due,
no
violation
of
substantive
due
process
because
just
refusing
to
live
up
to
state
law
doesn't
state
a
claim.
justice
white
now,
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
basis
for
denying
the
substantive
due
process
claim
or
not?
justice
white
all
right,
now
let's
assume
there
is
a
property
right
in
the
construction
permit--
justice
white
--now,
do
you
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
nevertheless
there
is
no
valid
substantive
due
process
claim?
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
white
--the
court
of
appeals
said
well,
even
if
arpe,
or
whoever
it
was,
even
if
there
was
a
violation
of
state
law--
justice
white
--state
law,
puerto
rican
law,
that
doesn't
necessarily
entitle
this
developer
to
relief.
justice
white
you
defend
that,
but
you
also
say
that
you
have
another
ground,
namely
that
there
wasn't
any
property
interest
at
all.
justice
white
i
take
it
as
a
respondent
you
are
saying
you
can
affirm
based
on
the
fact,
based
on
the
fact
that
there
is
no
property
interest
at
all
in
the
construction
permit.
