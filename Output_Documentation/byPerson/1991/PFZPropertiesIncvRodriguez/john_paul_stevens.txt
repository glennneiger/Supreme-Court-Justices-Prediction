justice
stevens
--may
i
just
be
sure
of
one
thing?
the
amended
complaint
you're
referring
to
is
at
page
131
of
the
appendix?
there's
only
one
amended
complaint,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
where
is
the
pretrial
order?
justice
stevens
so
we
really
don't
want
to
rely
on
that,
then,
if
we
can't
have
it
before
us.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
stevens
to
the
extent
that
you're
relying
on
your
response
to
justice
o'connor,
the
specific
right
to
have
specific
drawings
of
the
project
approved,
why
isn't
a
state
law
remedy
an
adequate
protection
for
that?
why
do
you
have
to
come
into
federal
court
to
get
that
right
protected?
justice
stevens
you
even,
you
went
to
the
supreme
court
too,
didn't
you?
justice
stevens
but
maybe
you're
not
required
to
exhaust.
i
understand
your
argument
there,
but
are
you
in
effect
saying
to
us
that
your
right
is
so
clear
that
if
we
had
gone
into
state
court
we
clearly
would
have
won?
justice
stevens
but
then
you
filed
an
action
in
the
puerto
rican
circuit
court,
or
whatever
the
name
of
the
tribunal
is,
making
these
allegations,
didn't
you,
that
they
had
looked
at
the
wrong
drawings?
justice
stevens
and
they
just
didn't
give
you
any
judicial
relief
at
all,
or
did
they
rule
on
the
merits
that
they
had
looked
at
the
right
drawings?
justice
stevens
it's
a
case
in
which
we
rejected
the
substantive
due
process--
justice
stevens
may
i
just
raise
a
question
here?
they
not
only
assumed
the
existence
of
a
property
interest,
but
they
also
assumed,
i
guess
this
is
what
paragraph
38
of
the
amended
complaint
says,
they
assumed
that
there
were
deliberate,
totally
unjustified
delays
in
processing.
it
was
an
arbitrary
refusal
to
process.
didn't
they
make
that
assumption
too?
justice
stevens
but
may
i
interrupt
again?
supposing
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint
to
say
(a)
we
had
a
property
interest
here,
and
(b)
we
had
an
application
that
was
on
file
in
1982
and
they,
for
no
reason
at
all,
refused
to
process
it
for
6
years.
they
weren't
corrupt,
they
weren't,
whatever
it
was,
they
just
arbitrarily
said
we
are
not
going
to
process
this.
isn't
that,
on
that
state
of
facts
does
that
violate
substantive
due
process?
justice
stevens
is
that
the
question
as
you
see
it,
then,
whether
a
government
agency
can
sit
on
its
hands
for
5
or
6
years
without
any
reason
at
all,
they
just
aren't
going
to
do
their
work,
whether
that
shocks
the
conscience
or
not?
justice
stevens
is
that
the
issue?
justice
stevens
he
says
he
has
no
other
state
remedy,
and
you
say
he
does
have
a
state
remedy?
justice
stevens
an
action
to
make
them
look
at
the
right
drawings?
