justice
souter
well,
mr.
richichi,
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
where
you
draw
the
line
between
the
property
right
that
you
are
now
describing,
i
think
you're
describing,
and
the
property
right
which
you
described
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
i
understood
your
answer
to
her
question
to
be
that
the
property
right
you
claimed,
the
denial
of
which
you
claim
was
the
property
in
the
permit,
you
had
a
right
to
get
that
permit
and
that
was
denied.
and
yet
as
i
read
your
allegations,
principally
those
sort
of
36
through
40
in
the
complaint,
i
read
them
as
referring
to
an
underlying
or
antecedent
right
that
i
think
you
are
talking
about
now
the
right
to
use
one's
land.
and
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
i
thought
you
were
narrowing
the
inquiry
and
saying
no,
the
right
here
is
just
the
right
to
get
the
permit,
having
fulfilled
certain
conditions
under
puerto
rico
law.
but
now
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
what
i
thought
your
complaint
argued,
an
underlying
right
to
use
one's
property,
permit
system
or
no
permit
system.
which
is
it?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
and
you,
would
you...
i
think
you
agree
but
i
want
to
be
sure,
that
your
complaint
does
not
set
out
allegations
from
which
on
its
face,
if
we
accept
them,
one
could
say
that
you
had
claimed
a
substantive
entitlement
to
this
particular
permit.
your
claim
rather
is
they
just
didn't
process
it
right.
they
delayed
and
therefore
they
denied
me
the
underlying
right.
is
that
a
fair
characterization?
justice
souter
but
you
don't,
you
don't
claim
in
express
terms
in
your
complaint
that
you
had
on
the
merits
met
every
condition
necessary
to
get
that
permit.
that's
not
what
you're
relying
on.
justice
souter
then
i
guess
you're
claiming
both
kinds
of
rights.
justice
souter
mr.
richichi,
if
instead
of
having
the
equivalent
of
cert
denied
when
you
went
into
the
puerto
rican
courts
the
court
had
taken
the
case,
it
considered
your
claim
that
they
looked
at
the
wrong
drawings
and
had
rejected
you
in
bad
faith
for
that
reason
and
had
said
no.
they
looked
at
the
right
drawings.
we
find
that
as
a
fact,
and
based
on
the
right
drawings
they
had
a
right
to
reject
the
permit
that
you
were
asking
for,
deny
the
permit
that
you
were
asking
for.
and
you
leave
the
court
saying
the
court
got
it
wrong,
the
drawings
were
the
wrong
ones
and
if
they
had
looked
at
the
right
ones
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
permit.
would
you
have
a
substantive
due
process
claim
to
bring
here
or
to
bring
into
a
federal
court?
justice
souter
but
you're
calling
a
fair
hearing
an
unfair
hearing,
what
could
also
and
i
think
would
normally
be
described
as
a
claimed
erroneous
hearing.
most
people
who
get
turned
down
think
there
is
something
wrong,
and
that
does
not
make
it
an
unfair
hearing.
justice
souter
and
it
seems
to
me
in
my
hypo
the
state
of
puerto
rico,
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
is
assuming
that
you
have
a
property
interest
there
subject
to
adjudication,
and
it
is
giving
you
process
to
adjudicate
it.
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
result,
and
you
may
even
be
right
that
they
are
wrong,
but
would
that
state
a
substantive
due
process
violation
simply
to
say
they
got
it
wrong?
justice
souter
then...
i'm
sorry.
justice
souter
then
does
your
claim
therefore
here
boil
down
to
the
fact
that
they
did
not
give
you
any
process
at
all
and
instead
simply
denied
your
opportunity
to
appeal
on
the
merits?
