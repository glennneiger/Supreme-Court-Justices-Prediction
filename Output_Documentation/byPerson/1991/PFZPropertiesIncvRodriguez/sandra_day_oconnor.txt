justice
o'connor
well
now,
you're
relying
here
on
a
substantive
due
process
violation?
justice
o'connor
we
didn't
grant
cert,
i
guess,
on
any
procedural
due
process
issue.
justice
o'connor
well,
on
the
substantive
due
process
issue
do
you
have
to
allege
a
property
right
in
receiving
the
permit,
the
construction
permit?
justice
o'connor
to
receive
the
construction
permit?
justice
o'connor
a
right
to
receive
the
construction
permit?
justice
o'connor
well,
would
you
answer
my
question
and
then
you
can
articular
whatever
you
want?
is
there
a
right
to
receive
a
construction
permit
under
puerto
rico
law?
justice
o'connor
and
what
is
that
law?
could
i
have
the
citation,
please?
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
that
the
law
that
you
cite
makes
clear
that
there
is
no
discretion
at
that
stage
in
granting
the
permit?
that
you
have
a
right
to
receive
the
construction
permit?
justice
o'connor
that
it's
ministerial
only.
justice
o'connor
no,
that's
justice
kennedy.
justice
o'connor
it
sounds
like
you're
trying
to
make
a
takings
claim
dressed
up
as
a
due
process
claim.
i'm
still
confused
about
what
it
is
you're
claiming.
it's
just,
it
is
totally
unclear
to
me
what
it
is
you're
really
claiming
here
and
what
property
you
say
has
been
taken,
and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
claim.
justice
o'connor
is
absolute
the
right
to
develop
the
property
as
proposed
by
your
clients?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
you
really
quarrel
with
is
that
you
didn't
get
adequate
procedural
due
process.
that's
what
really
sounds
to
me
like
you're
saying,
that
puerto
rico,
the
constitution
requires
puerto
rico
if
they
are
going
to
deny
you
a
permit
to
review
it
and
have
some
reason
for
the
denial.
justice
o'connor
well,
was
it
still
open
under
puerto
rican
law
to
puerto
rico
to
set
aside
this
area
for
some
kind
of
wildlife
preserve
or
something
of
the
sort?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
ramirez,
i
asked
this
question
and
was
referred,
i
believe,
to
note
5
on
page
4
of
the
reply
brief
and
the
citation
to
certain
laws
and
regulations
in
puerto
rico
that
the
petitioner
says
make
clear
that
arpe,
if
that's
what
we're
calling
it,
lacked
any
discretion
other
than
to
determine
whether
the
construction
drawings
had
been
assembled
and
submitted,
and
that
they
were
required
by
puerto
rican
law
to
grant
the
permit.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
view
that
arpe
has
a
wide
range
of
discretion
in
reviewing
construction
drawings
whether
to
grant
the
permit
or
not,
even
when
the
planning
board
has
issued
its
approval?
