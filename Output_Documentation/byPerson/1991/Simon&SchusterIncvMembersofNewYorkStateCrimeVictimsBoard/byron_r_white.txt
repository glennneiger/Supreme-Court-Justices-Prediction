justice
byron
r.
white
did
hill,
in
this
book,
write
about
anything
except
his
crimes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i...
i
suppose
that
if
the...
who
helped
him
write
the
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if...
if
that
writer
had
just
been
the
sole
author,
that
hill
had
been
perfectly
willing
to
sit
down
for
him,
with
him
for
100
hours
just
to
be
interviewed,
there
wouldn't...
the
author
could
have
said
the
same
thing
in
these
books...
in
this
book
without
any
problem
with
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
this
book
told
about
crimes
other
than
crimes
committed
by
hill,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
the
justification
for,
what
if
he
had
not
written
about
any
crimes
by
himself,
just
about
crimes
of
his
colleagues?
he
says,
i
was
a
member
of
the
mafia
but
i
never
committed
a
single
crime
and
i
know
about
all
these
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
statute
would
not
have
covered
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
crime
that
he
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
whole
justification
for
this
statute
is
that
the
public
is
outraged
by
the
spectacle
of
someone
profiting
by
recounting
a
crime.
it
is
simply
unjust.
it
is
outrageous.
isn't
that
the
whole
premise
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that's
true,
then
you
are
discouraging
the
speech,
are
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
billy
the
kid
wasn't
writing
about
his
crimes,
but
about
travels
in
the
west,
and
he
made
a
lot
of
money
out
of
it,
i
suppose
if
he
had
hurt
some
victims,
the
victims
could
sue
him,
but
they
very
likely
would
have
to
prove
their
case
before
they
could
attach
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
of
new
york
here
takes
it
in
advance.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
isn't
victims,
though,
that
have
access
to
the
escrow.
it
is
judgment
creditors,
any
judgment
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
also
the
state
can
get
unpaid
taxes
out
of
the
escrow.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
reduces
the
chance
that
the
writer
is
going
to
have
anything
left
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
possible,
if
there
is
a
judgment
creditor,
he
is
going
to
get
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
your
argument
would
be...
would
be
the
same
or
almost
the
same
even
if
in
this
book
only
crimes
that
hill
committed
were
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
i
take...
earlier
i
think
you
said
that
if...
if
a
person
has
committed
a
very
brutal
crime,
perfectly
sane,
and
he
just
makes
some
money
out
of...
out
of
writing
about
it
while
he's
in
prison,
you
say
the
first
amendment
forbids
the
application
of
this
law
to
him?
