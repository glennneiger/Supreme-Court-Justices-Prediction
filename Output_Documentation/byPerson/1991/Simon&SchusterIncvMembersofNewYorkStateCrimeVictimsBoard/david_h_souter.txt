justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
in
the
example
given
in
one
of
the
briefs,
under
the
forfeiture
statute
new
york
could
have
proceeded
against
any
profits
derived
by
mr.
milken
from
his
illegal
trading?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
object
is
not
to
preclude
the
criminal
from
directly
profiting,
the
object
is
simply
to
preclude
him
from
profiting
before
the
victims
get
paid?
it
is
a
victim
compensation
justification,
not
a
nonprofit
justification.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
everything
you
said
really
about
directly
profiting
is
essentially
beside
your
point?
