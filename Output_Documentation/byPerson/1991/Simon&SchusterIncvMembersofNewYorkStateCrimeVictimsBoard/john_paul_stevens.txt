justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
maybe
is
covered
in
the
briefs,
but
i
forget
it
if
it
is.
it
is
generated
by
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question.
has
section
10(b)
of
the
act
been
construed,
the
part
that
refers
to
any
person
who
has
voluntarily
and
intelligently
admitted
the
commission
of
a
crime,
for
such...
which
such
person
is
not
prosecuted?
has
that
been
construed
by
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
understand
that
provision
to
require
that
the
author
admit
that
what
he
did
was
in
fact
against
the
law
or
merely
must
admit
facts
which
this
commission
may
determine
violated
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
a
businessman
described
a
lot
of
business
activities
that
were
arguably
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
commission
would
decide
whether
in
fact
that
was
a
violation
of
law
or
not,
even
though
he
thought
he
was
innocent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
the
board
determines
to
be
criminal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
state...
i
mean,
maybe
their
problem
is
making
the
law
too
narrow.
what
if
they
just
took
out
the
requirement,
until
the
victim
is
totally
compensated?
what
if
they
just
said,
we
don't
think
people
should
profit
from
crimes,
and
nobody
should
make
money
from
the
commission
of
a
crime
by
getting
a
big
royalty
for
describing
it,
describing
his
emotions,
the
emotion
of
the
victim,
and
all
of
that.
would
that
law
be
better
in
your
estimation?
it
wouldn't
have
the
problem
you
just
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
slightly
different
question.
i
would
like
to
focus
a
little
more
precisely
on
the
state's
interest
involved
here.
one,
of
course,
is
to
compensate
victims
and
you
have
talked
about
that
mostly
today.
but
in
your
brief
you
start
out
with
the
principal
argument
that
a
wrongdoer
should
not
profit
from
his
or
her
wrong.
if
that
were
a
sufficient
justification,
the
statute
should
be
applied
to
victimless
crimes
as
well
as
those
that
have
victims,
should
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
could?
do
you
think
it
could
constitutionally
be
applied
to
victimless
crimes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
didn't
the
state
do
it,
do
you
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
think
the
interest
in
preventing
the
criminal
from
profiting
from
his
wrong
would
be
sufficient,
which
would
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
that
no
matter
how
trivial
the
wrong,
no
matter
how
great
the
reward
from
writing
the
book,
you
could
still
appropriate
the
entire
reward?
