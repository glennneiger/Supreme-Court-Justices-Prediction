of
course,
the
forfeiture
statute
does
not
turn
over
the
forfeited
proceeds
to
any
particular
victim.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
first
amendment
doesn't
encourage
the
writing
of
libelous
books,
certainly,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
this
maybe
another
category
of
books
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
encourage?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
these
authors.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
certainly
proceeds
in
the
but
for
sense.
but
for
his
commission
of
the
crime,
he
wouldn't
have
this
knowledge
that
he's
making
money
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
possible,
in
your
mind,
to
narrow
the
law
somehow
to
cover
only
those
cases
that
are
crime...
i
mean,
can
you
envision
no
case
in
which...
in
which
those
royalties
are
crime
proceeds?
justice
antonin
scalia
somebody
recounting
a
gory
rape
just
for
the
sensationalism
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
there
used
to
be
a
hypothetical
in
law
school,
as
i
recall,
about
the
person
who
steals...
indeed,
it's
in
the...
the...
the
autobiography
of
benvenuto
cellini.
he
steals
gold
or
bronze
or
something
and
then
crafts
a
beautiful
statue
out
of
it,
and
does
the
statue
belong
to
the
person
from
whom
the
bronze
was
stolen?
i
forget
what
the
answer
was.
[laughter]
do
you
know
what
the
answer
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
that's
the
same
problem
we're
talking
about
here,
as
far
as,
you
know,
someone
who
embellishes
by
his
artistry
the
account
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
ridiculous.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
thing
is
presumed
to
be
the
product
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
keep
saying
an
accent...
an
asset
that
flows
directly
from
their
victimization.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
acknowledged
before
that
the
entire
amount
of
that
asset
doesn't
flow
directly
from
their
victimization.
the
entire
advance
is
covered,
even
though
there
is
only
one
minor
incident
addressed
in
the
book,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
even
if
some
of
the
advance
covers
expenditures
for
paper,
pencils,
for
expenditures
for
production
of
the
book,
that
would
still
be
swept
up
into
the
escrow,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
not
just
the
direct
product
of
the
crime
that
is
covered
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
better
way
to
describe
it,
instead
of
constantly
referring
to
it
as
the
product
of
the
crime,
is
to
say
that
it
is
an
asset
tainted
by
the
crime.
isn't
that
quite
a
bit
more
accurate?
