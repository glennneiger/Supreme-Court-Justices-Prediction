mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
and
this
statute
is
about
criminals
profiting
directly
from
their
crime.
mr.
hill,
who
is
a
convicted
criminal
as
well
as
an
admitted
criminal,
his
book
is
not
simply
a
book
about
discussion
of
admissions
of
crime,
but
it
is
a
book
about
his
convictions
as
well.
and
the
statute
applies
in
his
case
for
both
reasons.
mr.
hill
and
the
other
people
to
whom
this
statute
has
been
applied
have
committed
crimes
and
have
created,
by
that
crime
directly,
an
asset.
an
asset
which
for
some
of
these
people
is
profitable
in
the
retelling.
this
statute
is
directed
against
that
asset
because
that
asset
is
directly
attributable
to
their
wrongful
conduct.
the
statute
has
a
compelling
purpose
because
the
story
here
is
a
story
which
flows
from
the
wrongful
conduct.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--no,
it
would
not.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
new
york's
conclusion
that
when
the
criminal
discusses
his
crime
and
is
paid
money
for
that
discussion--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--that
he
committed,
that's
correct,
that
the
criminal
is
then
profiting
directly
from
his
victimization.
what
the
statute
does
at
that
point
is
it
doesn't
look
at
the
criminal's
speech.
it
turns
its
attention
to
the
victims
of
that
crime,
the
people
who
have
been
harmed
and
the
people
who
have
been
injured.
and
it
says--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--the
underlying
premise
of
this
statute,
your
honor,
no,
is
that...
in
fact,
if
that
were
the
case--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--no,
it
is
not.
in
fact,
the
only
premise
is
that--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--the
statute...
the
statute
is
neutral
with
respect
to
the
speech.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
if
the
criminal
wants
to
discuss
his
story
and
say
anything
he
wants,
but
doesn't
make
a
dollar
on
that
discussion,
this
statute
does
not
apply.
but
the
second--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--part
of
what
you
said
is
true,
i
think.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
no,
you
are
not,
because
there
certainly
may
be
outrage.
that
may
exist.
but
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
only
thing
that
the
legislature
focused
upon
was
the
unfairness,
the
inequity.
in
fact,
the
statute
contains
provisions
which
one
might
say
could
encourage
criminals
to
speak.
there
are
incentives
in
this
statute.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
it
has
singled
out
the
story
of
the
speech.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
there
was
a
tax
directed
against
the
press'
means
of
publication,
which
because
of
the
history
of
taxation
in
this
country
is
presumptively
a
burden.
but
here,
what--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--well,
it
is
an
incidental
burden.
it
is
a
burden
because
some
people
will
chose
not
to
speak
because
they
are
not
getting
the
profits.
but
that
is
not
the
same
sort
of
burden
on
the
means
of
communicating
your
message.
this
statute,
you
have
to
understand,
is
directed
at
a
financial
incentive.
it
is
directed
at
one
of
the
reasons
why
people
chose
to
speak.
we
all
know--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--i
think
the
reason
it
extends
there
is
because
the
legislature
felt
that
the
story
of
a
crime
with
victims
is
a
direct
victimization.
and
that
other
profits
which
may
be
dealt
with
in
other
ways
did
not
create
the
same
sort
of
inequity.
when
the
criminal...
when
berkowitz
sits
down
for
an
interview
and
talks
about
why
he
killed
these
five
people,
and
then
is
paid
$
100,
000
for
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
new
york
and
the
other
states
can
say,
well,
we
can't
stop
his
speech.
in
fact,
he
has
a
right
to
speak.
but
he
does
not
have
a
right
to
profit
before
his
victims.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
correct.
this
statute--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--what
this
statute
does,
of
course,
is
it
doesn't
ask
the
board
to
sit
down
and
look
at
the
work
and
evaluate
how
much
speech
is
in
the
work
attributable
to
the
crime
or
what
the
reasons
were.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
for
purposes
of
attachment,
that
is
correct.
what
the
statute
does
is
it
applies
neutral
and
objective
criteria.
it
simply
says
that
if
you
are
profiting
from
this
asset,
your
victims
have
a
right
to
do
what
we
would
like
victims
in
this
country
to
do
more
often,
to
go
to
court
and
bring
a
civil
action.
and
if
they
recover
a
judgment,
you
now
have
this
asset
placed
in
escrow,
you
have
an
identifiable
asset.
the
victim
now
has
a
reason
to
sue
the
criminal
because
he
knows
that
the
state
is
holding
the
money.
all
the
victim
is
doing
under
this
statute,
your
honor,
is
that
he
is
filing
a
civil
action
for
his
damages
and
injury.
if
he
recovers
for
that
action
based
on
his
harm
that
the
criminal
has
caused
him,
it
shouldn't
matter
what
part
of
the
book
is
based
on
the
actual
crime.
the
critical
component
here
is
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
speech.
this
is
not
a
statute
which
is
aimed
at
publishers
to
try
and
stop
the
publishers
from
publishing
the
book.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
many
criminals
will
speak
and
will
continue
to
speak
with
these
statutes.
the
publishers
keep
their
profit.
the
publishers
are
not
compelled
to
edit
material
out
of
the
book.
but
yes,
there
is
a
financial
aspect
to
this.
we
don't
deny
that.
and
we
don't
deny
the
fact
that
some
criminals
will
say,
if
you
can't
guarantee
me
my
profits,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
my
story.
but
the
critical
issue
for
this
case
and
for
this
court
is
whether
or
not
new
york
has
appropriately
balanced
the
competing
interests
and
arrived
at
a
statute
which
is
narrowly
tailored
and
targeted
to
this
compelling
purpose.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
the
purpose,
your
honor,
is
to
ensure
that
people
who
commit
wrongful
acts
do
not
profit
directly
from
their
victimization.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
your
honor,
you
are
absolutely
right.
and
we
certainly
are
not
saying
that
victims
should
not
have
opportunities
to
get
at
notoriety.
but
this
statute
focuses...
notoriety
is--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--i
believe
that
the
essential
reason
is
because
new
york
saw
the
story,
the
asset
from
the
story
as
a
direct
relationship
to
the
victimization.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
well,
we
talk
about
injury
on
the
victims,
but
the
injury
this
statute
addresses...
and
there
is
obviously
a
temptation
to
say,
the
statute
is
based
upon
the
offensiveness
of
what
the
criminal
is
saying.
but
that's
not
what
this
statute
was
talking
about.
the
statute
was
targeted
at--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--that's
correct.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
well,
it
certainly
does,
but
the
key
factor
here,
you
also
have
to
recognize,
is
the
plight
of
victims,
your
honor.
we
have
a
situation
where
there
are
two
critical
components
of
this
statute.
first
of
all,
it
preserves
the
asset
at
the
time
that
the
money
is
paid.
in
many
of
these
cases,
the
money
is
paid
to
the
criminal
years
before
the
story
is
produced.
that
money
might
very
likely
be
dissipated.
this
statute
ensures
that
it
is
held
in
escrow.
the
second
thing
that
is
critical
about
this
statute
is
that
this
statute
extends
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
that
we
all
know
about
the
story
that
comes
years
after
the
criminal
is
released
and
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired.
the
victims
in
that
situation
have
no
remedy.
under
this
statute,
they
do
have
a
remedy,
but
the
remedy
is
limited
to
the
in
rem
proceeding
against
the
proceeds.
the
third
critical
component
as
to
why
this
statute
serves
new
york's
purpose
so
well
is
that
it
gives
victims'
judgments
a
priority
over
the
judgments
of
other
creditors.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
well,
it
is
a
combined
interest.
it
is
directly
profiting
before
your
victims,
your
honor.
if
the
victim's
judgments
are
less
than
the
money
in
the
account,
the
criminal
gets
what
remains
in
the
account,
which
is
another
reason--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
does
not.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--because
i
think
the
interest
that
the
state
focused
upon
which
is
the
critical
interest
here
is
the
unfairness
of
the
criminal
profiting
before
his
victims.
this
is
not
a
statute
designed
simply
to
tell
criminals,
you
can't
profit
at
all.
in
fact--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--i
do.
i
think
states
and
the
federal
government
have
valid
interests
in
stopping
criminals
from
profiting
from
crime,
but
this
statute
is
a
more
narrowly
tailored
statute
in
that
respect.
this
statute
allows
the
criminal
to
obtain
any
money
that
is
left
in
the
account.
what
this
statute
does,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--that's
true,
but
there
is
a
critical
reason
for
that.
what
the
statute
does--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--your
honor,
that's
true.
but
what
this
statute
does...
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
other
judgment
creditors,
it
doesn't
extend
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
more
importantly,
the
unsatisfied
judgment
creditor
who
normally
stands
in
line
before
the
victim,
under
this
statute
stands
in
line
after
the
victim.
the
reason
why
the
statute
discusses
judgment
creditors
is
to
make
sure
that
the
judgment
creditor
comes
after
the
victims'
judgment.
that
is
the
only
reason
why
the
statute
discusses
it.
it
establishes
a
priority.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
that
is
possible,
but
there
are
two
aspects
of
that--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--he
might
not,
but
we
are
talking
in
some
of
these
cases
about
substantial
sums
of
money.
we
hear
reports
of
criminals
making
$
500,
000
or
$
1,
000,
000
million
or
more,
but
what
this
statute
addresses
is
that
the
money
is
held
in
escrow
and
the
criminal
brings
his
civil
tort
action
for
his
injury
and
suffering.
it
is
very
hard
for
us
to
see
that
the
victims
who
have
been
injured
by
the
crime,
who
have
suffered
from
this
crime,
should
not
have
the
right
to
pursue
a
tort
remedy
and
know
that
there
is
an
asset
which
flows
directly
from
their
victimization,
which
the
board
is
holding.
that
is
why
this
statute
is
such
a
meaningful
statute,
and
frankly--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--that's
correct.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
well,
yes--
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
because
the
crime
is
in
the
story.
but
you
are
right,
the
statute
does
apply
an
objective
neutral
criterion.
it
does
not
seek
to
look
at
the
work
and
say
how
much
of
this
work
is
related
to
the
crime.
the
reason
again
for
that,
let
me
try
to
emphasize,
is
that
the
statute
simply
attaches
the
asset.
if
the
victim
sues
and
recovers
a
very
limited
judgment,
then
there
will
be
a
substantial
sum
of
money
available
for
this
person.
mr.
howard
l.
zwickel
well,
i
don't
think
new
york
looks
at
this
asset
in
terms
of
what
taint
might
suggest.
i
think
it
really
does
look
at
it
in
a
very
neutral
way,
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize
again
that
this
statute
is
not
simply
limited
to
one
type
of
book
or
one
type
of
speech.
it
is
a
broad-based
statute
which
applies
in
any
context
where
a
criminal
is
profiting
from
the
story
of
his
crime.
it
applies
to
magazine
publishers.
it
applies
to
interviews.
it
applies
to
any
situation,
and
all
the
statute
says
is
that
if
you
have
victimized
someone
and
if
someone
is
paying
you
for
that
victimization,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
small
part
or
a
large
part,
then
your
victims
come
first.
they
have
a
right
to
go
against
this
asset.
we
will
preserve
this
asset
for
your
victims
and
we
will
take
steps
so
that
the
victims
can
go
ahead
and
sue
the
criminal.
that
is
why
this
statute,
we
believe,
meets
strick
scrutiny
as
well
as
o'brien
scrutiny.
the
statute
is
targeted
precisely
to
its
purpose
and
its
purpose
is
both
a
legitimate
purpose
and
a
compelling
one.
for
these
reasons,
your
honors,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
2nd
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief.
there
will
be
no
further
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
