if
there
had
been
an
earlier
judgment
in
favor
of
the
victim
that
had
been
satisfied,
a
judgment
for
damages
caused
by
the
crime,
i
take
it,
no
new
cause
of
action
would
arise
by
reason
of
the
publication?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
could
a
state
court,
through
the
exercise
of
their
common
law
jurisdiction,
make
it
an
independent
tort
for
a
perpetrator
of
a
crime
to
recount
the
crime
for
profit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
in
a
rape
case
where
the
victim
is
suing
for
damages
there
has
been
a
book
recounting
the
lurid
details
of
the
crime.
could
the
jury
be
instructed,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
not
only
has
the
victim
suffered
anguish,
but
there
was
a
book
about
this
and
you
are
entitled
to
take
that
into
account
in
giving
your
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
hustler
case
there
was
no
antecedent
criminal
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
view,
a
rapist
could
break
into
the
victim's
apartment,
rape
the
victim,
and
then
write
a
lurid
account
of
it.
in
the
act
of
writing
or
the
collection
of
proceeds
from
the
writing,
that
could
not
be
independently
actionable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
that
is
a
far
cry
from
falwell,
because
here
there
is
an
antecedent
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
that
we
should
encourage
books
of
the
kind
i
just
described?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
justice
o'connor's
situation
where
there
is
a
statute
that
affects
oral
income,
it
is
shown
that
90
percent
of
the
recovery
is
from
people
who
author
books
after
committing
crimes,
or
produce
movies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
underlying
premise
is
that
this
speech
ought
to
be
discouraged.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
underlying
premise
that
the
speech
is
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
underlying
premise
is
that
this
speech
is
right?
