justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rauchberg,
are
there
other
laws
in
new
york
that
apply
to
other
assets
of
someone
who
has
committed
a
crime;
not
this
statute,
but
other
statutes
that
would
make
other
assets
subject
to
reach
under
a
scheme
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
your
understanding
that
under
this
particular
statute
that
an
author
who
admitted
in
the
course
of
a
book
that
20
years
before
he
had
stolen
a
pack
of
cigarettes,
that
that
would
bring
him
under
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rauchberg,
could
a
state
pass
a
law
making
all
income
of
a
convicted
criminal
subject
to
escrow
to
pay
victims
of
his
crimes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
kind
of
a
curious
case
because
all
the
payment
restriction
cases
that
we
have
had,
i
think,
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
can't
limit
payments
by
the
speaker
to
a
messenger.
and
yet
in
this
case,
we
have
payments
to
the
speaker
by
the
publisher.
so
we
have
not
had
that
situation,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
zwickel,
the
state
has
certainly
singled
out
speech
for
a
financial
burden
in
this
statute.
is
that
not
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
has
imposed
the
burden
only
on
speech
of
a
particular
content.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case,
then,
from
taxes,
such
as
in
minneapolis
star
or
arkansas
writers
project?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
saying
this
isn't
a
financial
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
does
it
not...
why
should
it
not
have
to
extend
to
other
ways
of
profiting
from
criminal
behavior,
then?
why
just
publishing
a
book?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
for
announcement
is
no.
90-1059,
simon
&
schuster
versus
members
of
the
new
york
state
crime
victims
board.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
new
york
has
a
so-called
son
of
sam
law.
it
requires
that
an
accused
or
a
convicted
criminal's
income
from
works
describing
his
crime
be
deposited
in
an
escrow
account.
these
funds
are
then
made
available
to
victims
of
the
crime
and
to
the
criminal's
other
creditors.
the
petitioner,
simon
&
schuster,
published
a
book
entitled
wiseguy
in
which
henry
hill,
an
admitted
organized
crime
figure,
described
his
life
of
crime.
the
respondent,
the
new
york
state
crime
victims
board,
compelled
simon
&
schuster
to
place
hill's
income
from
the
book
in
an
escrow
account.
simon
&
schuster
then
brought
this
suit
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
son
of
sam
law
is
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
statute
constitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
the
first
amendment
prevents
a
state
to
regulate
speech,
based
on
the
content
of
that
speech,
only
where
the
regulation
is
narrowly
tailored
to
advance
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
son
of
sam
law
imposes
a
financial
burden
on
speech
only
if
a
particular
content.
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
compensating
crime
victims
from
the
proceeds
of
the
crime
but
little
at
any
interest
in
limiting
that
compensation
to
the
proceeds
of
the
criminal
speech
about
the
crime.
because
the
son
of
sam
law
reaches
a
substantial
amount
of
speech
that
does
not
enable
a
criminal
to
profit
from
crime
while
victims
remain
uncompensated,
it
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
advance
the
state's
interest.
as
a
result,
we
hold
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
blackmun
and
justice
kennedy
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
