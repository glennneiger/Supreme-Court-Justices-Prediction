mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner,
simon
&
schuster,
is
here
today
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
section
632(a)
of
new
york's
executive
law,
commonly
known
as
"the
son
of
sam"
law.
the
challenge
is
both
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
statute
and
to
its
application
to
simon
&
schuster
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
section
632(a)
was
enacted
in
1977
and
applies
to
works
of
expression
and
only
to
works
of
expression.
it
applies
to
books,
movies,
magazine
articles,
and
the
other
expressive
works
that
are
specified
in
the
statute.
whenever
a
publisher--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--there
are
two
sets
of
statutes
that
might
be
responsive
to
your
question.
first,
there
is
the
statutes
that
provide
tort
remedies
for
all
victims
of
tort,
which
of
course
apply
to
crime
victims
as
well,
and
second,
it
bears
mentioning
that
new
york
has
a
law,
as
i
would
guess,
most
jurisdictions
do
that
have
laws
like
this,
new
york
has
a
law
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
the
proceeds
of
crime.
of
course,
there
has
never
been
any
contention
that
the
forfeiture
provision
would
pertain
to
the
proceeds
of
a
book
or
other
expressive
work
or
to
royalties
for
the
authorship
of
a
book.
but
other
than
that,
no.
other
than
that
there
is
only
this
statute
selecting
speech-related
assets
for
special
treatment.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
that's
correct.
the
forfeiture
statute
provides
for
forfeiture
to
the
state,
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
it
never
occurred
to
the
legislators
in
new
york
that
the
forfeiture
statute
would
pertain
to
the
proceeds
of
a
book
contract,
and
therefore,
any
suggestion
that
these
are
somehow
crime
proceeds
i
think
is
simply
not
correct.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
it
applies
to
both
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
and
the
proceeds
of
the
crime.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
no,
i
don't
think
it
could
because...
oh,
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
profits
from
illegal
trading,
assuming
that
they
violated
state
laws
as
well
as
federal
laws,
would
be
presumably
within
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
the
new
york
statute,
yes.
the
statute
has
an
extremely
broad
definition
of
the
phrase
criminal.
in
fact,
it
uses
the
term
person
accused
or
convicted
of
a
crime,
and
in
addition
to
applying
to
persons
who
are
accused
of
crime,
it
applies
to
persons
convicted,
whether
of
state
crimes
or
of
federal
crimes,
but
it
goes
beyond
that
to
include
in
its
application
persons
who
are
acquitted
of
crimes
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
it
also
applies
to
persons
who
are
never
charged
with
crime
at
all,
but
who
are
deemed
by
the
crime
victims
board
to
have
admitted
crimes.
all
of
these
various
types
of
authors
are
treated
as
persons--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--absolutely.
it
absolutely
would.
the
law
has
been
interpreted
by
the
state
courts
in
new
york
to
contain
a
special
statute
of
limitations
provision
that
starts
the
limitations
period
running
anew
for
any
crime
victim
who
wishes
to
begin
a
proceeding,
collect
a
judgment,
and
obtain
access
to
the
proceeds
of
the
book,
first
of
all,
so
the
20-year
period
would
not
be
a
barrier.
and
second
of
all,
the
statute
does
apply
not
only
to
those
who
are
convicted,
but
to
those
who
are
found
to
have
admitted
crimes
in
their
book.
and
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
henry
hill,
the
criminal
whose
activities
triggered
the
application
by
the
crime
board
of
the
statute
to
simon
&
schuster
is
somebody
who
was
cooperating
with
federal
and
state
prosecutors,
was
in
the
witness
protection
program,
and
had
been
immunized
rather
than
being
charged
with
the
various
activities
described
in
his
book.
and
he
was
found
to
be
within
the
description
of
a
convicted
person
because
his
book
was
deemed
to
contain
admissions
of
crime.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
the
state
courts
haven't
treated
that
question,
and
so
i
suppose
there
is
possibly
some
room
for
argument.
but
i
think
that
is
a
likely
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
the
statute
as
not
being
applicable
to
victimless
crimes.
and
so
it
would
seem
not
a
great
step
for
the
statute
to
be
interpreted
as
not
applying
to
those
crimes
with
victims
where
the
victims
have
been
fully
compensated
as
well,
but
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
think
not.
i
think
that
such
a
statute,
making
a
tort
out
of
speech,
would
be
so
inconsistent
with
the
concepts
of
the
first
amendment
that
it
would
absolutely
have
to
be--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--i
think
not.
i
think
not.
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
truthful
speech,
nondefamatory
speech
may
be
outrageous,
may
be
offensive,
and
is
nonetheless
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
for
example,
in
the
hustler
case.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
don't
think
the
antecedent
criminal
act
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
speech
ought
to
be
protected
or
not.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
say
that
is
right.
i
say
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
there
is
an
antecedent
crime,
but
the
crime
is
a
separate
act
from
the
authorship
of
a
book.
the
authorship
of
a
book
is
an
act
to
be
encouraged,
not
an
act
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
my
position
is
that
the
first
amendment
encourages
the
writing
of
all
books,
and
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
distinguish
between
which
books
should
be
encouraged
and
which
books
should
not.
and
more
to
the
point,
it
is
not
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
decide
that
books
on
a
specified
subject,
namely
crime,
by
a
specified
class
of
authors,
namely
criminals
as
defined,
are
books
to
be
discouraged
as
opposed
to
encouraged.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
it
does
not.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
there
isn't
any
issue
of
false
statements
raised
here.
the
concern
that
i
have
about
the
content-based
discriminations
that
this
law
creates
is
that
it
brings
about
exactly
the
kind
of
distortion
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
that
content-based
laws
are
capable
of
doing,
and
for
that
reason
are
abhorrent.
there
are
abortion
protesters
in
wichita,
kansas
who
are
committing
crimes
based
on
their
view
of
human
life.
there
are
animal
rights
activists
in
connecticut
who
disrupt
medical
experimentation
at
u.s.
surgical
through
sabotage
and
other
criminal
acts.
there
are
terminally
ill
patients
whose
doctors
and
whose
family
members
assist
them
in
suicide
or
sometimes
even
take
action
themselves
and
face
criminal
charges.
there
are
battered
women
who
respond
to
violence
with
violence
in
return
who
find
themselves
indicted,
and
this
law
says
to
simon
&
schuster
that
if
it
wants
to
publish
books
on
the
issues
of
abortion
or
euthanasia
or
animal
rights
or
women's
issues,
it
can't
commission
books
by
these
authors.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
it
can't
commission
these
authors
to
tell
their
stories,
which
can
be
an
important
part
of
the
public
debate
on
those
four
issues,
and
that
is
four
examples.
new
york
state
says
no
to
simon
&
schuster.
commission
books
from
the
victims,
from
the
prosecutors,
from
the
police
officers,
but
not
from
the
victims,
who
have--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
garden-variety
publishing
contract.
we
have
the
activities
of
the
press
carried
on
in
the
way
the
press
has
carried
on
its
activities
for
decades,
in
which
a
contract
is
made
to
provide
for
payment
in
order
to
get
the
work.
now
it
is
the
rare
author
who
is
able
to
work
without
the
assurance
of
timely
compensation.
this
author,
the
record
shows,
expected
timely
compensation
and
got
it
because
the
statute
was
not
complied
with.
the
record
shows
that
most
authors
require
timely
compensation.
if
you
can't
compensate
an
author,
you
will
get
less
authorship.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
because
then
we
wouldn't
have
a
content-based
selection
of
speech
for
special
treatment
that
results
in
a
distortion
of
the
flow
of
ideas.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
think
it
is
correct
to
think
of
henry
hill
as
a
speaker.
but
it
is
also
correct
to
think
of
simon
&
schuster
as
a
speaker.
simon
&
schuster
resolved
to
put
out
a
book
that
would
have
a
particular
kind
of
anti-crime
message
that
would
be
an
antidote
to
romanticized
versions
of
crime
like
the
godfather.
simon
&
schuster
resolved
to
utter
that
speech.
simon
&
schuster
is
a
member
of
the
press.
simon
&
schuster
is
a
speaker.
and
in
order
for
simon
&
schuster
to
have
engaged
in
the
speech
of
publishing
this
book,
which
it
wished
to
do,
it
had
to
make
the
payment.
you
can't
say
to
a
publisher,
you
are
free
to
publish,
but
you're
not
free
to
pay
for
manuscripts.
there
won't
be
any
manuscripts,
or
there
will
be
precious
few,
if
they
cannot
pay
for
them.
so
we
have
two
speakers
here,
hill
and
simon
&
schuster.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
at
some
point
an
apparently
general
statute
could
be
shown
to
be,
in
fact,
aimed
at
speech.
but
i
don't
think
that
is
what
would
happen
here.
the
instances
of
criminals
profiting
from
crimes
through
the
authorship
of
books
are
nil.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
happens.
this
law
has
been
in
effect
since
1977.
and
in
its
14
years,
the
state
of
new
york
has
established
exactly
six
escrow
accounts,
one
of
which
was
returned
to
the
criminal
because
no
victims
came
forward,
four
of
which
are
still
there
waiting
to
see,
and
only
one
of
which
has
produced
any
payments
to
a
victim.
so
there
has
been
the
victims
of
precisely
one
criminal
who
have
been
advantaged
by
the
statute.
so
a
general
statute,
if
there
were
a
general
statute
enacted
that
would
help
victims
obtain
compensation
through
enhancing
their
ability
to
get
at
all
the
assets
of
the
criminals,
we
see
there
would
be
precious
few
examples
of
books,
but
all
of
the
assets
that
criminals
have,
the
millions
of
a
michael
milken
or
an
ivan
boesky,
and
whatever
assets
criminals
have,
would
all
be
better
reached
by
victims
under
such
a
statute.
so
i
don't
think
we
would
find
that
90
percent
figure
suggested
by
your
honor's
hypothetical.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
well,
it
wouldn't
specifically
discourage
the
authorship
of
books,
just
as
tax
laws
generally
applied
don't
discourage
the
authorship
of
books.
the
general
tax
laws
don't
encourage
people
to
engage
in
renumerative
activities
other
than
authorship.
they
make
the
playing
field
equal.
and
a
statute
like
this...
let
me
say
it
this
way.
the
new
york
statute
says
to
any
criminal
in
need
of
funds,
don't
try
to
support
yourself
by
writing
a
book,
support
yourself
by
getting
a
job.
if
you
had...
if
you
had
a
statute
of
general
applicability,
you
would
not
have
that
impact.
i
gave
before
examples
of
criminals
whose
voices
should
be
heard
in
the
debate
on
public
issues
concerning
abortion
and
other
subjects.
not
all
of
those
people
have
independent
means
that
permit
them
to
write
books
without
compensation.
most
of
them,
presumably,
need
to
earn
a
living.
and
a
statute
of
general
applicability
wouldn't
encourage
them
one
way
or
another.
the
new
york
statute
says
to
those
people,
you
have
to
go
to
work
and
you
can't
spend
your
efforts
writing
a
book.
the
new
york
statute
says
to
simon
&
schuster
that
you
cannot
compensate
those
people
for
books
that
you
want
to
publish
that
you
deem
valuable
and
results
in
our
not
having
those
books.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
it
was
applied
in
this
case.
it
was
that
definition
that
was
invoked
by
the
crime
board
to
apply
the
statute
to
this
book,
but
without
any
particular
discussion
elaborating
on
the
meaning.
so
we
don't
have
any
learning
beyond
what
is
on
the
face
of
the--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--i
would
understand
it
to
be
the
latter.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
that
is
right.
i
would
understand
the...
i
would
understand
the
definition
to
mean
that
one
who
admits
to
having
committed
acts
that--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--that
is
right.
because
henry
hill
in
his
book
does
not
say
that
i
engaged
in
acts
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
thereby
violated
section
so-and-so
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
he
says
what
he
did.
it
may
not
have
presented
very
difficult
questions
about
whether
or
not
it
was
a
crime;
but
nonetheless,
he
says
what
he
did,
he
describes
his
behavior.
and
his
behavior
as
described
in
his
words
was
held
to
be
the
trigger
that
led
to
the
application
of
the
statute.
now,
the
interests
that
new
york
advances
in
an
effort
to
justify
this
content-based
law
that,
in
fact,
inhibits
speech
are,
first,
the
interest
in
victim's
compensation.
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
that
interest
can't
save
this
statute.
if
the
existing
remedies
available
to
plaintiffs
in
civil
actions
in
new
york
are
inadequate
to
meet
the
needs
of
crime
victims,
it
is
incumbent
upon
new
york
to
enhance
them
generally
so
that
crime
victims
generally
can
do
better
in
reaching
the
assets
of
criminals.
and
not
just
enhance
them
for
this
one
asset
that
is
speech-related.
i
think
the
state
recognizes
that.
and
so
it
goes
on
into
what
is
a
more
sophisticated
effort
to
justify
the
statute.
it
says
it
is
wrong
for
a
criminal
to
be
able
to
profit
from
a
description
of
his
crime
in
a
book
while
the
victim
of
the
same
crime
remains
uncompensated.
now
i
think
that
that
is
an
interest
that
at
bottom
rests
on
the
same
concerns
about
victim's
compensation.
yes,
it
is
wrong
for
the
victim
to
go
uncompensated
while
the
criminal
has
the
assets
from
a
book.
but
it
is
also
wrong
for
the
victim
to
go
uncompensated
while
the
criminal
has
his
wages
not
subject
to
a
wage
garnishment
or
while
the
criminal
enjoys
any
other
assets
that
he
may
own.
the
victim's
claim
for
damages
is
a
claim
that
enables
him
to
seize
any
and
all
assets
of
a
criminal
except
to
whatever
extent
a
state
passes
exemptions
for
homestead
or
the
like.
but
with
those
exceptions,
the
victim's
claim
on
the
criminal's
assets
extends
to
all
of
his
assets.
and
it
is
offensive
when
the
victim
fails
to
have
that
claim
satisfied
in
all
of
its
instances.
it
is
not
offensive
only
when
criminals
get
to
keep
the
proceeds
of
speech
and
no
other
proceeds.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
it
wouldn't
have
the
problem
i
just
described,
but
it
would
have
different
problems.
that
would
be
a
law
that
would
declare
all
of
these
payments,
these
royalties,
to
be
crime
proceeds.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
and
i
don't
think
the
legislature
can
turn
them
into
crime
proceeds
just
by
declaration.
there
has
to
be
an
independent
consideration
because
of
the
first
amendment
interests
of
whether
they
really
are
crime
proceeds.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
that's
correct,
but
they're
not
proceeds
of
crime
in
the
sense
of
any
proximate
cause
sense.
the...
the...
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
one
book
that
this
law
would
have
applied
to
had
it
been
enacted
earlier
is
the
autobiography
of
malcolm
x.
now,
that
is
a
book
that
recounts
malcolm
x's
early
life
of
crime
as
a...
as
a
stick-up
artist,
as
a
dope
peddler,
as
a
burglar,
and
then
proceeds
to
describe
how
he
overcame
that
to
become
an
important
leader
of
the
black
community,
and
it
is
a
book
that
earned
royalties
because
malcolm
x
put
in
the
effort
to
create
a
compelling
account
of
his
life
because
of
his
position
and
fame
as
a
political
leader
and
because
of
the
ideas
that
he
stood
for
that
were
of
great
interest
to
people
at
the
time.
now,
i...
i
would
suggest
that
the
royalties
paid
by
the
publisher
to
malcolm
x
are
not
crime
proceeds.
they
are
instead
the
earnings
of
an
author
in
the
typical
way
that
authors
earn
money,
through
being
who
they
are
and
through
the
sweat
of
their
brow.
this
law
says
that
those
are
all
crime
proceeds,
and
i
suggest
that
that's...
that
that's
not
correct.
they're
not
crime
proceeds,
and
the
law
that
your
honor
is
hypothesizing
would
also
treat
them
as
crime
proceeds
when
in
fact
they're
not
crime
proceeds.
if
new
york
seriously
thought
they
were
crime
proceeds,
it
might
have
tried
to
proceed
against
them
under
a
forfeiture
statute.
i
might
add
that
the
new
york
court--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--well--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--i
have
difficulty
ever
considering
the
proceeds
to
be
proceeds
of
crime
because
of
the
intervening
act
of
authorship,
but
even
if...
even
if
such...
even
if
such
a...
such
a
work
could
be
imagined,
there
is
the
question
of
whether,
in
order
to
protect
all
of
the
works,
we
need...
we
need
to
tolerate
that
work
as
well
in
the
service
of
the
first
amendment.
i...
i
don't
know
how
a
statute
could
be
written
without
vagueness
problems
that
would
single
out
that
kind
of
a
book,
assuming
it
were
right
to
do
so.
in
any
event,
that's
not
before
us,
because
this
law
in
its
breadth
takes
in
every
mention
of
crime.
violent
crime,
nonviolent
crime,
state,
federal...
they're
all
in
there...
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
and
so
it
is
so
far
beyond
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
i
brought
some
books
with
me
today.
[laughter]
i
have
malcolm
x's
autobiography,
but
not
benvenuto
cellini's.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
well,
the...
one
does
more
than
embellish
by
artistry
the
account
of
a
crime
in
a
book
like
the
autobiography
of
malcolm
x.
or
another
example
would
be
jean
harris'
book
about
prison
conditions
in
bedford
hills,
where
the
point
of
the
book
is
to
discuss
the
effect
of
prison
on
the
relationships
between
women
and
their...
and
their...
prisoner
women
and
their
children,
and
they're...
because...
because
in
2
chapters
of
the
14
chapters
in
the
book
there's
mention
of
the
crime
for
which
she
was
convicted,
the
whole
book
gets
treated
as
though
it's
crime
proceeds.
what...
what...
what
i
also
wanted
to
say
about
the
subject
of
crime
proceeds
is
that
the
state
of
new
york...
excuse
me,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
the
other
ways
in
which
persons
who
are
criminals
arguably
can
capitalize
on
their
expertise.
there
are
criminals
who
gain
notoriety
and
as
a
result
of
their
notoriety
are
able
to
appear
on
talk
shows
to
sell
books,
to
sell
magazine
articles,
and
if
they
don't
mention
their
crime
new
york
permits
them
to
have
earnings
as
a
result
of
the
notoriety
that
they
gain
through
crime,
and
doesn't
make
any
effort
to
get
at
those
earnings.
there
are
also
criminals
who
develop
expertise
through
their
criminal
activities,
like
the
bank
robber
willie
sutton
who
was
in
fact
retained
as
a
consultant
to
banks
on
bank
security.
new
york
has
no
interest
in
that,
either.
if
new
york
were
interested
in
a
very
broad
novel
expansive
definition
of
crime
proceeds
it
should
do
it
comprehensively
and
not
single
out
speech.
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
in
dealing
with
that
issue
is
that
it
recognized
that
criminals
in
fact
can
profit
in
that
way,
but
it...
it...
it
said
that
that's
not
the
point
of
the
law.
the
point
of
the
law
is
to
seize
the
proceeds
of
speech,
and
it
doesn't
really
explain
why,
and
in
effect
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
saying
is
that
the
law
is
narrowly
tailored
to
seize
precisely
the
proceeds
of
this
speech.
i
don't
think
that's
a
defense
of
the
law,
i
think
that's
an
admission
that
the
law
is
targeted
at
speech,
and
since
laws
targeted
at
speech
inevitably
will
deter
some
of
the
speech
at
which
they're
targeted,
it's
what
condemns
the
law
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
well,
yes,
he
did.
he
wrote
about
many
things.
he
wrote
about
how
the
mob...
and
when
i
say
the
mob,
i
mean
to
talk
about
activities
of
organized
crime
figures
other
than
himself,
crime
figures
that
he
observed
or
heard
about
in
his
years
of
leading
a
life
of
crime.
but
he...
he
wrote
about
how
crime
figures...
figures
corrupt
politicians.
he
wrote
about
a
specific
judge
in
the
new
york
state
court
system
who
handed
out
ludicrously
low
sentences
to
organized
crime
figures.
he
wrote
about
how
crime
figures
in
prison
are
able
to
continue
to
conduct
their
prison
activities...
excuse
me,
their
criminal
activities,
and
lead
a
quality
of
life
that--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--nicholas
pileggi.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
that's
right.
this
book...
this
book
depended
on
hundreds
of
hours
of
interviews
by
pileggi
of
hill,
and
had
hill
been
willing
to
spend
those
hundreds
of
hours
without
any
compensation
whatever,
this
law
wouldn't
have
applied.
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
payment
to
hill
that
triggered
the
application
of
the
law.
but
hill
was
not...
hill
was
not
willing
to
do
that.
the
record
shows
that
hill
wanted
to
be
paid.
hill
wanted
a
publishing
contract,
and
so
in
this
case,
this
book,
which
is
a
valuable
book,
which
is
being
called
the
best
crime...
book
about
crime
written
in
america
could
only
have
been
written
as
a
result
of
making
payments
to
the
person
whose
information
was
essential
to
its
creation.
the
book
doesn't
exist
without
payments
to
hill,
and
the
book
is
a
valuable
book.
i'd
like
to
save
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
thank
you.
i
wanted
to
say
a
word
about
the
statement
that
hill
had
been
convicted
of
crimes.
the
book
makes
a
reference
to
conviction
for
attempted
larceny,
and
since
it's
an
attempt
by
definition
i
suppose
it
was
unsuccessful
and
there
was
no
victim.
it
makes
a
reference
to
a
gambling
conviction
which
the
board
also
might
hold
to
be
victimless
crimes.
the
board
placed
its
judgment
below
only
on
the
admission
of
crimes.
there
wasn't
a
word
about
any
convictions,
and
if
it
addressed
convictions
it
might
well
hold
them
irrelevant.
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
yes,
it
would
be
about
the
same,
and
if
hill...
if
hill
had
in
fact
been
convicted
of
crimes
and
that
were
the
basis
for
the
law
being
applied
here,
then
one
of
the
interests
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
has
identified,
namely
punishment,
might
be
triggered.
i
did
want
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
says
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
punish.
i
don't
think
it's
well-tailored
to
do
that,
as
our
brief
states,
but
in
any
event
new
york
cannot
determine
to
punish
the
mentally
ill,
those
who
are
never
charged,
like
hill,
who
were
not
convicted.
he--
mr.
ronald
s.
rauchberg
--yes.
yes,
i
do
say
that,
and
i
say
we
have
to
tolerate
whatever
offense
we
take
in
that
circumstance
in
order...
in
order
to
have
the
valuable
speech
that
we
have
when
other
criminals
like
henry
david
thoreau,
malcolm
x,
martin
luther
king,
and
many
others
named
in
our
briefs,
have
written
books
that
make
reference
to
their
crimes.
