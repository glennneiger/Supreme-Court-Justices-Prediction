chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-1059,
simon
&
schuster,
inc.
v.
the
members
of
the
new
york
state
crime
victims
board.
mr.
rauchberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rauchberg,
does
the
forfeiture
statute,
is
its
reach
limited
to
items
that
were
used
in
the
commission
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
proceeds
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
can
commission
books
from
the
victims,
simon
&
schuster
just
has
to
put
the
money
in
escrow,
doesn't
it,
and
pay
it
ultimately
not
to
the
criminal
defendant,
but
to
the
victim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
not
such
a
law
also
discourage
the
writing
of
books,
although
it
would
do
lots
of
other
things,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rauchberg.
mr.
zwickel,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zwickel,
you
speak
as
though
the
law
very
nicely
cuts
out
the
profits
that
he
is
making
because
of
his
recount
of
the
crime.
but
in
fact,
it
does
not.
it
says
whatever
amount
he
gets
from
the
whole
book.
so,
you
know,
there
is
confessions
of
st.
augustine,
he
recounts
how
he
stole
an
apple.
i
assume
that,
you
know,
whatever
st.
augustine
got
for
that
book,
the
whole--
[laughter]
--the
whole
amount,
right,
the
whole
thing
would
be
considered
proceeds
of
the
apple-stealing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
purpose
is,
again,
mr.
zwickel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
take
it,
in
new
york,
supposing
billy
the
kid
had
lived
in
new
york
when
this
statute
was
in
effect.
if
he
had
written
about
the
21
men
that
he
killed,
he
would
be
subject
to
this
statute.
if
he
wrote
about
travels
in
the
southwest
and
said
nothing
about
these
21
men,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
this
statute.
yet,
ordinarily
a
victim
should
be
able
to
get
of
hold
of
either
of
those
proceeds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
new
york
distinguish
between
those
two
kinds
of
books
written
by
a
criminal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
kind
of
inflicting
injury
on
the
victims
all
over
again,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
zwickel.
mr.
rauchberg,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rauchberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
