chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-860,
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
v.
montana.
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
that
you
would
ever
solve
the
fractional
remainder
problem
by
any
reasonable
increase
in
the
size
of
the
house
of
representatives.
if
you
increased
it
to
a
point
where
montana
was
clearly
entitled
to
two,
you'd
probably
have
a
situation
where
washington
was
almost
entitled
to
a
couple
more,
but
not
exactly.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
reasonable
increases
in
the
size
of
the
house
would
ever
solve
the
fractional
remainder
problem.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
general
starr,
you're
using
the
political
question
idea
then
not
as
meaning
barring
adjudication,
but
as
a
very
heightened
form
of
deference.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
sir,
i'm
not
sure
if
that
qualifies
as
the
traditional
political
question
which,
you
know,
at
one
time
was
said
a
thicket
that
courts
should
just
stay
out
of,
or
simply
saying
that
given
the
constitutional
standard
of
according
to
their
respective
numbers,
it
leaves
all
sorts
of
reasonable
alternatives
open
to
congress
that
would
be
reviewed
only
if
the
alternative
weren't
reasonable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
general
racicot,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
don't
you
agree
that
the
situation
of
the
intrastate
redistricting
even
for
congress
is
quite
dramatically
different
than
the
situation
of
assigning
representatives
to
50
different
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why,
why
would
we
apply
those
same
rules?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
directive
to
congress
doesn't
say
achieve
population
equality.
it
says
according
to
their
respective
numbers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
you're,
that
there's
any
question
here
but
what
the
constitution
does
require
that
every
state
have
one
representative
and
by
implication
requires
that
districts
not
cross
state
boundaries.
those
are
not
inequities.
i
mean,
those
are
constitutional
provisions
that
are
not
subject
to
challenge
here.
and
so
however
that
rubs
off
on
state
districting,
i
think
that
you've
got
to
deal
with
those
things
not
as
producing
inequity,
as
you
call
it,
but
that's
what
the
constitution
provides
for.
it
suggests
that
equality,
numerical
equality
is
not
an
overriding
thing,
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested
to
you,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
racicot.
general
starr,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-860,
united
states
department
of
commerce
versus
montana
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
