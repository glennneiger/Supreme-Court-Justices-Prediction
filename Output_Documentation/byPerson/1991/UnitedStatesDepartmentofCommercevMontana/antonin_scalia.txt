justice
scalia
general
starr,
what
if
congress
decided
to
apportion
it
roughly,
for
the
most
part
according
to
population,
but
put
an
upper
limit?
congress
says,
you
know,
california
is
getting
awfully
big,
and
we
think
just
as
there's
a
minimum
limit
there
ought
to
be
a
maximum
limit
too.
what
if
it
did
that?
could
we
review
that?
justice
scalia
we
could
not
review
it?
justice
scalia
really?
congress
could--
justice
scalia
--i'm
saying
it's
not
according
to
their
numbers.
they're
saying
california,
once
california
has
more
than
a
certain
number,
we
don't
care
how
big
california
gets,
that's
too
big.
we're
not
going
to
allow
any
more.
justice
scalia
i
think
you've
given,
you've
given
wyoming
the
solution,
or
montana.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
just
take
some
representatives
away
from
california
and
parcel
them
out.
this
is
not
really
a
big
problem
for
the
congress.
i
thought
it
was
a
really
big
problem.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
the
directive
to
the
states
says
even
less
than
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
in
fact
it
says
nothing
at
all,
except
republican
form
of
government.
justice
scalia
we
didn't
discover
that
until
1964,
which
is,
i
suppose,
your
answer
for
why
for
almost
200
years
we
have
never
had
the
right
solution,
because
this
court
didn't
give
the
answer
until
1964.
wesberry,
i'm
talking
about.
justice
scalia
the
larger
the
state...
you
cannot
have
the
proportion
of
swing
with
a
state
that
is
very
numerous
in
population,
has
a
lot
of
districts.
one
more
or
less
district
is
not
going
to
make
the
difference
between
500
and
800
per
representative.
isn't
the
swing
going
to
be
a
lot
more
with
a
small
state?
justice
scalia
i
think
it
has
to
be.
justice
scalia
the
bias,
there
may
be
bias
just
as
likely
with
respect
to
big
states
as
small
states,
but
the
degree
of
it
will
always
be
much
less.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
how
can
you
possibly
ascribe
that
overriding
objective?
you're
saying
this
pushes
aside
everything
else,
all
other
considerations
which
some
of
these
other
methods
take
into
account.
you
say
this
is
a
categorical
consideration.
how
can
you
attribute
that
to
a
system
which
says
no
matter
what,
if
we
figure
it
all
out
and
you
don't
even
get
one
representative,
we're
still
going
to
give
you
one?
i
mean,
isn't
this
a
system
that
has
not
adopted
that
principle?
it
has
not
adopted
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
as
an
overriding
consideration.
justice
scalia
no,
but
i'm
asking
you
how
do
you
explain,
how
you
reconcile
with
your
position
the
fact
that
the
constitution
itself
provides
for
one
representative
even
if
you're
not
entitled
to
one
on
the
basis
of
one
person,
one
vote?
justice
scalia
but
it
makes
it
harder
for
you
to
argue
that
the
only
consideration
to
be
taken
into
account
is
numerical
parity,
because
that
was
not
the
only
thing
that
congress
took
into
account
when
it
set
up
this
system.
so
maybe
there
are
other
values
that
congress
can
reasonably
take
account
of,
so
long
as
it's
basically
proceeding
on
a
numerical
system.
justice
scalia
i
presume
that
under
this
constitution
the
house
could
provide
for
only
50
members.
i
mean,
suppose
the
house
says
we
want
to
become
more
prestigious
than
the
senate.
[laughter]
we
will
have
only
50
members.
each
state
would
have
one
representative,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
that
would
comport
with
the
constitution.
justice
scalia
well,
you
have
a
lot
of
time,
maybe
you
could
explain
the
five,
the
five
different
mathematical
systems
to
us.
[laughter]
