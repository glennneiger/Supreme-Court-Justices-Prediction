justice
stevens
or
it
may
suggest
that
the
representatives
from
california
can
outvote
the
representative
from
montana.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
mr.
starr,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
methods
as
a
group?
is
it
true
that
for
all
of
them,
focusing
on
the
fractional
remainder
point
that
you
say,
like
california
has,
what
is
it,
52
and
1/8
is--
justice
stevens
--then
all
of
those
would
require
that
california
get
either
52
or
53?
justice
stevens
i
thought
that
always
took
the
next
higher
number,
didn't
it?
jefferson?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
at
this
point,
is
it
part
of
your
submission
that
the
hill
method
is
always
distorted
against
a
smaller
state?
justice
stevens
but
the
bias
under
that
method
will
not
necessarily
be
against
a
smaller
state,
or
do
you
contend
it
is?
justice
stevens
it
could
have
been
against
massachusetts
or
new
york
or
any
one
of
the
other
states?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
when
you're
talking
about
these
big
percentages?
supposing
we
took
in
a
new
state,
like
guam,
which
is
very
much
smaller
than
all
the
other
states.
inevitably
the
percentage
distortion
would
be
much
greater.
say
there
were
only
100,000
people
in
the
state,
so
they
would
get
one
representative
when
the
ideal
is
572,000.
so
isn't
there
always
a
potential
for
even
more
dramatic
distortion
than
you
describe?
justice
stevens
may
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
submission?
are
you
contending
the
dean
method
is
constitutionally
compelled?
justice
stevens
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
question,
because
the
dean
method
was
i
guess
the
last
one
to
be
developed
of
the
five
that
are
before
us.
if
another
one
should
be,
someone
should
think
up
one
that's
even
more
equitable
according
to
your
submission,
would
that
then
become
constitutionally
compelled?
justice
stevens
okay.
and
what
about
your
reference
to
a
system
that's
easily
understood?
is
there
any
virtue
in
the
most
easily
understood
method?
justice
stevens
is
it
really?
i've
had
the
most
difficulty
understanding
that
one
myself.
[laughter]
the
others
i
can
understand
without
much
difficulty,
but
that
one
i
really
have
trouble
with.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
to
comment
on
one
other
thing
that
runs
through
my
mind.
it
may
be
entirely
irrelevant,
but
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
overall
national
fairness
and
so
forth,
is
it
at
all
relevant
to
consider
the
fact
that
montana
has
two
senators?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
montana.
article
i
section
2
of
the
constitution
requires
apportionment
of
representatives
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers.
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
in
1941
provides
that
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
are
apportioned
among
the
states
by
a
method
known
as
the
method
of
equal
proportions.
in
the
apportionment
following
the
1990
census,
montana's
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
was
reduced
form
two
seats
to
one.
the
state
and
various
officials
brought
suit
alleging
that
the
method
of
equal
proportions
resulted
in
the
distribution
of
representatives
that
violated
the
principle
of
equal
representation
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
required
in
the
context
of
intrastate
districting
decisions,
those
made
by
a
state
legislature
affecting
the
districts
within
the
state.
a
majority
of
the
three-judge
district
court
agreed
with
montana
and
held
that
the
apportionment
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
relied
on
our
cases
holding
that
when
a
state
legislature
defines
congressional
districts,
it
must
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
precise
mathematical
equality.
as
our
cases
involving
variances
of
only
a
fraction
of
1%
demonstrate,
that
goal
is
realistic
and
appropriate
for
state
districting
decisions.
in
this
case,
however,
whether
montana
has
one
district
or
two,
its
variance
from
the
ideal
district
will
exceed
40%.
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
a
minimum
of
one
representative
for
each
state
in
execrably
compels
a
significant
departure
from
the
ideal.
in
alaska,
vermont,
and
wyoming
where
the
statewide
districts
are
less
populous
than
the
ideal
district,
every
vote
is
more
valuable
than
the
national
average.
moreover,
the
need
to
allocate
a
fix
number
of
indivisible
representatives
among
50
states
of
varying
populations
makes
it
virtually
impossible
to
have
the
same
size
district
in
any
pair
of
states,
let
alone
in
all
50.
accordingly,
although
common
sense
supports
a
test
requiring
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
precise
mathematical
equality
within
each
state,
the
constraints
impose
by
article
i
section
2,
itself,
make
that
goal
illusory
for
the
nation
as
a
whole.
in
view
of
the
constitutional
constraints
on
the
apportionment
of
representatives,
any
method
will
result
in
substantial
differences
between
the
sizes
of
congressional
districts
in
different
states.
a
congressional
decision
to
adapt
the
equal
proportions
method
apparently
reflected
a
good
faith
effort
to
establish
a
fair
apportionment
of
representatives.
we
cannot
say
that
the
alternative
methods
proposed
by
montana
would
better
fulfill
the
constitutional
principle
of
equal
representation.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reversed.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
