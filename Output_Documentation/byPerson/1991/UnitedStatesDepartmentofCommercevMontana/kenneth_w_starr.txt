mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
article
i,
section
2,
clause
3
of
the
constitution
provides
that
representatives
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
according
to
their
respective
numbers.
this
case
brings
before
the
court
the
judgment
of
a
three
judge
district
court
holding
unconstitutional
the
act
of
congress
that
since
1941
has
governed
the
apportionment
of
representatives
among
the
several
states.
as
the
court
has
been
informed,
a
three
judge
district
court
in
massachusetts
has
very
recently
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion,
rebuffing
a
constitutional
challenge
mounted
by
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
the
montana
case
and
the
massachusetts
case
in
its
wake
have
resurrected
a
controversy
as
old
as
the
constitution
itself,
how
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
fractional
remainders
in
the
apportionment
of
representatives
to
the
states.
the
fractional
remainder
problem
arises
because
of
two
things.
first,
the
constitution
by
its
terms
requires
that
no
matter
how
sparsely
populated
the
state,
each
state
shall
have
at
least
one
representative
in
the
house.
and
secondly,
the
implicit
constitutional
requirement,
that
no
district
shall
transgress
or
cross
a
state
line.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
congress
has
not
been
consistent
in
terms
of
the
specific
method
that
has
been
employed,
but
what
congress
has
done,
justice
blackmun,
is
to
examine
what
it
believes
to
be
the
most
appropriate
method,
including,
as
the
court
is
aware,
at
the
founding
that
congress
in
1792
in
response
to
the
debate
in
those
early
years
determined
in
the
wake
of
president
washington's
veto
to
disregard
fractional
remainders
entirely.
and
that
was
the
history
of
apportionment
for
the
first
5
decades.
it
was
only
in
the
1840
census
that
the
method
was
changed,
and
indeed
over
the
decades
congress
has
used
no
fewer
than
four
methods
of
apportionment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
not.
it
has
always
been
thought,
as
has
this
question,
to
be
a
matter
entrusted
to
the
judgment
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
in
fact
in
federalist
'55
madison
said
quite
plainly
that
no
political
problem
admits
of
a
less
precise
solution
than
the
size
of
the
house
of
representatives.
and
the
issue
before
the
court
today
flows
quite
naturally
from
that,
because
until
1911
congress
always
had
the
option,
which
it
exercised
from
time
to
time,
of
increasing
the
size
of
the
house
of
representatives.
but
again,
that
is
not
a
textually
committed
power.
nonetheless
it
is
one
that
has,
from
the
founding
of
the
republic
been
one
that
is
viewed
as
falling
to
congress
and
not
admitting
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
it
could.
the
problem
of
fractional
remainders
would
not,
there
would
still
have
to
be
a
method
for
dealing
with
fractional
remainders.
but
montana
could
eventually
get
an
additional
representative
were
congress
willing
to
increase
the
size
of
the
house.
but
madison
wisely
advised
at
the
founding
that
a
representative
body
should
not
be
so
numerous
that
it
becomes
similar
to
an
athenian
assembly,
and
yet
it
should
be
large
enough
to
be
representative
of
the
people
as
a
whole.
and
since
1911
the
congress
has
fixed
the
size
of
the
house
of
representatives
at
435,
and
neither
court
now
to
address
this
issue
has
suggested
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
judiciary
to
mandate
to
override
congress'
judgment
as
to
the
size
of
its
own
house.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
order
to
have
precise
apportionment,
i
am
not
sure
that
that
calculation
has
been
done.
at
least
i
am
certainly
not
aware
of
any
calculation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
status
is
that
a
final
judgment
has
been
rendered,
and
the
united
states
is
presently
considering
precisely
what
to
do.
and
there
are
several
alternatives
that
we
are
presently
actively
considering
and
we
will
come
to
closure
on
that
within
a
matter
of
a
very
few
days.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
massachusetts
court
directs
action
to
be
taken
by
march
31.
that
again
is
a
decision,
as
the
court
is
aware,
that
rejected
the
constitutional
challenge
but
overturned
the
apportionment
on
non
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
the
point
is
well
taken.
it
would
not
ultimately
solve
it.
i
meant
to
suggest
that
montana's
concern
about
maintaining
its
two
representatives
would
be
solved
under
the
existing
method
if
the
size
of
the
house
were
increased
by
approximately
six
or
seven
representatives,
then
under
this
apportionment
method
it
would
eventually
be
entitled
to
that
additional
representative.
but
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
making
the
critical
point
here.
someone
is
going
to
be
a
winner
and
someone
is
going
to
be
a
loser,
inevitably.
and
in
1980,
in
the
wake
of
that
apportionment,
montana
was
quite
pleased
because
it
was
comparatively
over
represented,
and
the
two
representatives
who
are
parties
to
this
action
trumpeted
the
virtues
of
the
equal
proportions
method.
which
again
suggests
that
ultimately
this
is
a
debate
that
should
go
on
among
the
states
as
represented
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
and
thus
we
do
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
that
is
entrusted
to
the
discretion
of
the
congress.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
is
none,
but
it
has
been
viewed,
as
justice
story
stated
in
the
1830's
in
prigg
against
pennsylvania,
as
flowing
ineluctably
from
the
very
nature
of
the
plan
of
power.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
it
was
an
act
of
congress
that
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
i
am
sorry,
in
terms
of
the
presentation.
congress
has
done
this
by
an
act
of
congress,
by
statute,
and
presenting
it,
and
no
one
has
questioned
that
that
is
a
matter
that
is
entrusted
to
the
political
branches,
that
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--not
to
the
congress
entirely,
but
to
the
political
branches,
but
congress'
discretion
is
quite
broad.
but
to
answer
your
question
specifically,
justice
white,
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1941
with
the
expectation
that
this
would
bring
stability
and
finality
to
the
process.
this
is
obviously,
since
elections
are
effected
in
the
house
of
representatives
every
two
years,
a
matter
that
cries
out
for
a
quick
and
speedy
resolution,
and
that's
why
congress
has
imposed
very
precise
and
demanding
statutory
duties
in
terms
of
the
time
table
for
completing
the
census,
for
doing
the
calculations
and
then
making
the
report
from
the
president
to
the
congress.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
entrusted
to
the
political
process--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--as
long
as
it
is
according
to
their
respective
numbers,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
long
as
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
as
long
as
it
is
tying
it
to
respective...
and
i
think
it
is.
you're
suggesting
that
it's
not,
but
i
think
although
we
are
at
the
outer
perimeter
of
congress'
discretion,
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
does
have
that
discretion
if
it
so
chooses.
but
may
i
supplement
that
by
this?
history
illuminates
the
meaning
of
the
text,
and
it
certainly
is
clear
that
what
congress
has
been
struggling
to
do
over
these
many
decades
is
to
come
as
close
to
quota
as
possible,
and
there's
no
question
that
equal
proportions
advances
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
that
is
a
matter
that
congress
could
consider,
but
the
fact
that
it
has
not
done
so,
justice
scalia,
suggests
the
wisdom
and
the
efficacy
of
the
political
process.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
perhaps
are
not
so
eleemosynary-minded
as
might
be
suggested.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
my
own
view,
as
opposed
to
what
is
appropriate
for
judicial
review,
i
would
be
informed
by
history.
i
would
be
guided
by
that.
and
the
point
i
was
making,
justice
kennedy,
in
response
to
justice
scalia
is
this,
that
congress
has
always
sought
to
employ
a
method
that
gets
at
quota,
as
close
as
possible
in
round
numbers
to
the
precise
numerical
entitlement.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
terms
of
my
own
perception
i
would
be
more
guided
by
history,
frankly,
and
i
would
view
it
as
difficult
to
depart
from
history.
i
think
history
illumines
the
meaning
of
the
text.
nonetheless,
i
do
think
in
terms
as
a
matter
of
raw
power
that
congress
could
see
fit
to
engage
in,
and
my
colleagues
therefore
who
might
not
share
my
perspective
as
to
the
illumination
that
history
provides,
might
very
well
say
we
do
have
a
political
problem
in
this
country
that
we
want
to
solve,
namely
the
largest
states
have
become
a
little
bit
too
large
and
we
need
to
in
fact
give
a
little
bit
of
bias
in
favor
of
the
smaller
states.
but
there
is
still
a
rational
relationship
to
population.
that's
what
can't
be
done,
quite
clearly.
it
would
be
not
only
anticonstitutional,
it
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional
to
simply
ignore
the
numbers
or
ignore
the
population
of
the
respective
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
correct.
and
i
do
think
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
that's
why
we
have
said
that
the
political
question
doctrine
does
not
shield
all
aspects
of
congress'
action,
and
certainly
if
there
were
a
violation
of
a
specific
textual
requirement,
then
the
courts
can
in
fact
call
congress
to
account
for
that.
but
as
long
as
there's
a
rational
relationship
to
population,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
a
matter
that
the
political
process
should
in
fact
handle.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
that's
one
way
of
formulating
it.
i
think
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
precise
issue
of
which
of
competing
apportionment
methods
that
are
indisputably
related
to
population,
once
we
reach
that
stage
then
it
seems
to
us
that
that
issue
is
shielded
from...
and
why
is
that,
because
under,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
under
baker
v.
carr
what
congress
is
making
in
choosing
one
apportionment
method
over
another
is
a
basic
policy
choice
about
equity
and
fairness
among
the
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
the
court
could
come
at
it
from
that
method
of
analysis
as
well
by
virtue
of
the
broad
powers
that
congress
enjoys
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
and
that
was
the
method
that
the
massachusetts
three
judge
court
engaged
in
or
used
in
rejecting
the
constitutional
claim.
but
our
basic
submission
is
this,
that
it
is
quite
wrong
to
believe,
as
the
three
judge
court
in
montana
did,
the
majority
did,
that
this
court's
articulation
of
the
one
person,
one
vote
standard,
which
of
course
was
articulated
and
applied
in
the
in-state
setting
that
was
at
issue
in
wesberry
and
in
karcher
against
daggett,
is
applicable
in
this
setting
when
that
standard
or
ideal
of
absolute
equality
cannot
in
fact
be
achieved.
i
should
hasten
to
add
that
these
methods
are
extremely
similar
in
terms
of
their
results.
each
uses
the
population
of
the
state
as
the
numerator.
the
divisor
varies
from
method
to
method,
and
there
are
certain
variations.
but
all
of
the,
the
three
principle,
i
should
say,
competing
methods
are
extremely
close
in
terms
of
the
results.
we're
therefore
quite
far
removed
from
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
wesberry,
the
problem
of
rotten
boroughs,
as
it
were,
which
was
of
concern
at
the
founding
in
terms
of
the
gross
disparity
in
district
sizes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
three
of
the
methods
would,
two
would
not.
the
adams
method,
which
our
colleagues
also
urged
upon
the
district
court,
would
result
in
what
we
call
a
quota
violation.
it
would
actually
give
california
only
50
seats.
the
jefferson
method,
which
ignores
fractional
remainders,
also
resulted
in
quota
violations
in
the
1830
apportionment,
and
that
was
one
of
the
primary
reasons
that
webster--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
it
did,
and
yet
for
mathematical
reasons
that
i
don't
pretend
to
understand,
the
jefferson
method
had
a
particular
methodology
to
it
that
resulted
in
a
quota
violation
in
the
1830
census
in
reapportionment.
and
that
prompted
both
webster
on
the
one
hand
and
adams
on
the
other
to
come
forward
with
their
method.
webster's
was
employed.
again
the
congress
employed
the
vinton
or
hamilton
method
in
the
1850
methods,
and
what
congress
was
seeking
to
do
in
this
area
is
find
the
best
possible
choice
that
maximized
various
indicia
of
equity,
of
fairness.
and
they
thought
that
equal
proportions
did
that,
and
it
clearly
does
not
violate
quota.
it
could
not
have
violated
quota.
when
we
have
gone
back
and
taken
the
numbers
back
to
1792,
equal
proportions
would
never
have
done
what
jefferson
and
adams
could
do
and
in
fact
did
do
in
1830.
it
seems
to
us,
in
short,
that
the
basic
error
of
the
three
judge
court
was
to
transplant
to
alien
soil
a
standard
that
does
not
apply,
and
in
the
process
grossly
intruded
into
the
province
of
congress
which
quite
clearly
has
carefully,
elaborately
considered
which
method
is
best
and
chose
that
method,
and
sought
to
achieve
something
that
joseph
story
in
his
commentaries
in
the
1830's
suggested
was
very
important,
and
that
was
stability
and
predictability.
congress
thought
it
achieved
that
in
1941,
with
the
irony
that
senator
hugo
black
urged
the
adoption
of
equal
proportions,
the
author
of
wesberry
against
sanders.
this
was
viewed
as
a
fair
method
that
created
a
balance
between
the
interests
of
large
and
small
states,
as
well
as
being
emphatically,
enthusiastically
recommended
by
distinguished
panels
of
mathematicians.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
would
like
to
submit
that
point
on
the
briefs.
[laughter]
but
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
that
equal
proportions
rides
roughshod
over
concerns
about
absolute
differences,
i
refer
the
court
to
footnote
38
in
our
brief,
which
i
think
goes
a
long
way
to
suggesting
that
there
is,
with
all
respect
to
our
colleagues
from
montana,
a
certain
artificiality
about
their
argument,
even
accepting,
as
we
urge
the
court
not
to
do,
their
basic
proposition
that
congress
is
bound
by
the
constitution
to
embrace
a
particular
measure
of
equality.
but
once
we
move
beyond
that
area
where
we
can
achieve
absolute
equality
in
crossing
state
lines,
we
see
in
these
rivers
of
inequality
that
have
been
referred
to
that
under
the
dean
method
there
are
very
considerable
inequalities.
essentially
what
montana
wants,
and
it's
quite
understandable,
is
to
go
to
the
smallest
state.
it
doesn't
like
being
the
largest
single
district.
it
wants,
as
it
would
be
under
its
proposed
method,
the
state
that
enjoys
the
smallest
by
far
of
the
congressional
districts.
and
when
we
look
to
those
absolute
deviations
in
population,
i
shouldn't
use
the
term
deviation,
but
absolute
differences,
what
we
see
is
that
it
is
not
at
all
curious
that
an
equal
proportions
method
designed
to
achieve
goals
of
equity
and
fairness
results
in
a
state
that
has
been
over
represented
for
some
time,
now
being
relatively
under
represented
for
a
period
of
time.
and
that
it
is
curious
in
the
extreme
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
require
washington,
with
a
higher

lose
that
representative
and
give
it
to
montana

in

to
washington
state's
8.538.
with
respect
to
the
articulation
of
the
standard,
yes,
it's
quite
true
that
the
constitution
does
not
speak
in
words
of
equality.
this
court
has
inferred
that,
but
it
has
inferred
it
from
section
1,
using
the
term
the
people.
and
this
court
in
its
decisions
in
yarborough
and
classic
over
the
years
has
viewed
that
as
endowing
a
personal
interest
on
the
part
of
each
of
our
citizens
in
participating
in
the
political
process.

of
the
states,
a
process
in
which
congress

the
states
are
represented,
are

it
is
a
process
that
speaks
in
terms
of
that
which
history
tells
us,
that
it
has
been
a
process
entrusted
to
the
political
branches,
but
political
branches
that
have
been
quite
sensitive
to
the
needs
for
basic
fairness
and
equity.
and
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
equal
proportions
method,
among
others,
achieves
those
goals.
