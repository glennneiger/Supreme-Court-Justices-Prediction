justice

well,
there's
another
factor
that
enters
in,
isn't
there,
the
fact
that
the
house
of
representatives
has
a
limited
number
of
members?
justice
white
and
that
is
not
in
the
constitution,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
this
problem
in
massachusetts
and
montana
certainly
could
be
cured
by
increasing
the
size.
justice
white
of
course
there's
no
express
delegation
to
the
congress
in
the
constitution
to
do
this,
is
there?
justice
white
did
the
present
method
of
apportionment,
did
that,
that
was
an
act
of
congress,
was
it?
justice
white
did
it
have
to
be
signed
by
the
president?
justice
white
well,
it's
not
just
delegated
to
the
congress
alone
then.
justice
white
well,
but
not
to
the
congress.
