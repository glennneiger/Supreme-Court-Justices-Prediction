justice
kennedy
has
any
calculation
been
done
to
show
how
large
the
house
would
have
to
be
in
order
to
have
precise
apportionment?
justice
kennedy
if
you
were
a
member
of
the
congress
and
that
somewhat
startling
proposal
were
made,
would
you
think
you
were
violating
your
duties
under
the
constitution
as
a
congressman
if
you
voted
for
that
bizarre
solution?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
suppose
you
were
met
with
that
proposal.
would
you
consider
it
consistent
with
your
constitutional
duty
to
support
that,
if
you
supported
that
proposal
after
you
reviewed
history,
et
cetera?
justice
kennedy
there
has
to
be
some
rational
relation?
