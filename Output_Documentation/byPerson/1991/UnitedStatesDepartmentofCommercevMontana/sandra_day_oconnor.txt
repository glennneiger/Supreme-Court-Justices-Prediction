justice
o'connor
general
racicot,
would
you
indicate
whether
you
think
that
in
your
view
congress
has
ever
apportioned
the
fractions
in
a
way
that
meets
the
constitution?
it
has
used
four
different
methods.
i
have
the
impression
from
reading
your
brief
that
none
of
them
would
have
met
your
test.
justice
o'connor
i
think
that's
sort
of
an
extreme
position
to
take
when
we're
trying
to
interpret
what
the
constitution
requires
and
when
the
practice
has
gone
back
so
far
in
the
nation's
history
of
permitting
congress
to
make
this
sort
of
a
determination.
