mr.
marc
racicot
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
first
of
all
answer
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
posited
during
the
solicitor's
argument.
first
of
all
with
justice
kennedy,
how
large
would
the
house
have
to
be
to
accommodate
if
the
standard
proposed
by
the
state
of
montana
were
adopted,
namely
the
dean
method,
the
accommodation
would
occur
in
terms
of
adding
two
members,
and
then
all
three
states,
washington,
massachusetts,
and
montana,
would
then
at
that
point
in
time
have
the
representatives
that
they
have
currently
been
notified
that
they
would
secure.
in
terms
of
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
concerning
fractional
remainders,
that
will
always
be
a
problem
until
such
time
as
the
constitutional
maximum
is
reached,
which
would
be
1
for
every
30,000,
and
of
course
that
would
approach
8,600
representatives
which
is
quite
obviously
not
a
palatable
solution,
i
would
suspect.
and
in
reference
to
the
adams
method,
justice
stevens,
you
requested
why
is
it
that
it
can
in
fact
create
something
known
as
the
alabama
paradox,
and
that
is
because
it
ignores
all
the
fractional
remainders,
and
as
a
consequence
it
ends
up
providing
fewer
seats.
you
run
out
of
seats
before
in
fact
all
of
them
are
ultimately
presented.
the
question
in
montana's
view
is
does
the
standard
for
population
equality
enunciated
in
wesberry
and
kirkpatrick
and
karcher
apply
to
congress?
does
it
apply
to
their
congressional
reapportionment
duties?
or
put
another
way,
should
the
same
standard
of
fairness
required
of
all
other
governmental
bodies,
including
local
government
bodies,
apply
to
congress
when
they
apportion?
contrary
to
the
suggestions
of
the
united
states
in
their
brief,
this
court
is
not
being
asked
to
second
guess
experts
in
the
field
of
mathematics
or
to
direct
and
any
way
dissect
the
statistical
underpinnings
of
the
five
historically
recognized
apportionment
methods,
nor
be
able
to
distinguish
between
all
the
very
complicated
mathematical
concepts
that
are
involved
in
all
five
of
these
various
formulas.
the
court
in
our
judgment
need
only
determine
which
of
the
methods,
which
all
have
a
different
measure
of
equity,
and
which
one
of
those
methods
is
designed
to
meet
the
constitutional
goal
that
has
been
articulated
by
this
court
in
the
intrastate
setting
concerning
apportionment.
mr.
marc
racicot
justice
o'connor,
in
view
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
is
precisely
what
we
mean
to
indicate.
although
there
has
never
been
a
case--
mr.
marc
racicot
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
a
close
examination
of
the
apportionment
history
of
this
country
would
find
that
there
has
been
more
accommodation
than
there
has
been
any
process
sustained
in
principle.
and
that
in
fact
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
cases
that
have
been
put
forth
by
this
court
with
the
intrastate
reapportionment
processes
that
occur,
one
will
find
a
very
simple
thread
throughout
all
of
them,
and
that
is,
number
one,
you
determine
an
ideal
population
district,
the
district
size,
by
taking
the
total
amount
of
the
population
and
dividing
the
number
of
seats
that
are
available.
that
determines
an
ideal
district
size,
and
then
all
the
deviations
are
measured
from
that
ideal
district
size.
the
only
formula
that
is
agreed
by
all
of
the
parties
that
does
that
is
the
dean
method,
which
has
never
been
used.
so
in
our
judgment,
although
there
have
certainly
been
accommodations
throughout
our
history,
the
dean
method
has
never
been
used,
and
as
a
consequence
does
not
come
to
the
point
where
it
meets
this
court's
demands
within
the
intrastate
setting.
and
the
question
then
becomes,
in
our
judgment,
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
require
of
congress
the
same
expectations
that
we
require
of
states
and
other
local
government
entities.
mr.
marc
racicot
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
true
because
of
the
obvious
constitutional
requirements
that
there
be
no
more
than
1
for
every
30,000,
and
also
that
state
boundaries
be
respected.
we
cannot
reach
as
much
mathematical
precision
as
we
can
within
the
intrastate
setting,
but
applying
the
same
rules
that
have
been
used
in
those
cases
to
congress
will
allow
us
to
get
much
closer.
mr.
marc
racicot
because
that's
how
population
equality
or
district
equality
is
achieved.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
according
to
the
respective
numbers
of
people
within
those
states.
and
quite
obviously
if
one
takes
a
real
close
look
at
the
constitutional
convention
debates,
i
think
that
that
was
a
question
that
was
paramount
in
their
minds
as
well,
was
continually
how
are
we
going
to
reach
population
equality,
how
are
people
going
to
be
equally
represented.
mr.
marc
racicot
it
does,
justice
scalia.
mr.
marc
racicot
that's
right.
there
is
much
more
of
a
textural
reference
to
this
particular
process
than
there
is
the
one
that
this
court
has
found--
mr.
marc
racicot
--that's
precisely
correct.
it
is
also
agreed
without
any
question
between
the
parties,
between
the
experts,
between
those
states
who
have
appeared
as
amicus,
between
all
concerned,
that
the
ideal
district
size
pursuant
to
the
1990
census
is
572,466
people.
with
the
hill
method,
with
the
method
of
equal
proportions
as
presently
codified
in
statute,
montana
is
by
far
the
largest
district
in
the
nation
with
a
population
of
803,655
people.
it
exceeds
the
ideal
district
size
by
231,000
people,
or
by
40.4
percent.
so
it
takes
in
montana
800
people
to
have
the
same
voting
strength
as
500
have
in
idaho
or
rhode
island.
now,
under
that
method
that's
presently
codified
in
the
statute--
mr.
marc
racicot
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
you
can
always
determine
bias
from
a
number
of
different
perspectives,
and
that
there's
no
consistent
way
to
measure
bias.
mr.
marc
racicot
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes,
sir.
mr.
marc
racicot
it
may
well
be,
justice
scalia,
but
the--
mr.
marc
racicot
--historical
perspective
indicates
that
bias
is
not
necessarily
something
that
can
be
established
under
those
circumstances
over
the
long
course.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
under
the
method
presently
used
by
congress
there
is
a
total
range,
from
the
largest
district
of
montana,
at
803,000
to
the
smallest
district,
wyoming,
at
455,000
people.
there
is
a
range,
then,
of
347,000
people,
which
is
a
61
percent
deviation
from
the
ideal.
under
the
method
proposed
by
montana,
the
method
of
harmonic
means,
the
most
populous
district
would
be
south
dakota,
with
699,000
people,
and
the
smallest
would
be
montana,
with
401,000,
which
produces
a
range
of
298,000
people,
rounded
off.
mr.
marc
racicot
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
requirement
that
each
state
be
provided
at
least
one,
there
is
some
built
in
inequity,
but
in
our
judgment
that
doesn't
justify
allowing
the
process
to
become
more
unequal
by
the
application
of
a
formula
that
simply
doesn't
produce
the
most
equitable
results.
we
have
then
with
the
method
of
harmonic
means,
the
method
advocated
by
the
state
of
montana,
a
deviation
of
52
percent
from
the
ideal.
so
quite
obviously
there
will
always
be
some
opportunity
for
deviation.
so
under
the
hill
method
or
the
method
of
equal
proportions,
the
statutory
method
presently
there,
there's
a
61
percent
deviation
from
the
ideal,
which
is
reduced
to
a
52
percent
deviation
from
the
ideal
under
the
method
of
harmonic
means.
and
under
karcher
and
in
the
context
of
the
intrastate
reapportionment
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
a
deviation
of
less
than
1
percent
from
the
ideal
was
not
constitutionally
acceptable.
quite
obviously
those
are
different
cases
in
different
settings,
but
nonetheless
this
court
has
been
very,
very
precise
in
its
examinations
of
intrastate
redistricting.
and
although
not
precisely
described
in
wesberry,
the
way
this
court
has
determined
whether
one
person's
vote
is
worth
as
much
as
another's
is
described
with
particularity
in
the
kirkpatrick
case
in
1969.
what
happens
in
that
case
and
in
every
subsequent
case
is
this,
the
ideal
population
equality
is
determined
by
taking
the
total
population,
and
in
that
case
missouri,
dividing
by
the
number
of
congressional
seats
that
were
allocated
to
give
an
ideal
district
size.
then
the
range
of
variation
is
examined
from
the
ideal
to
determine
if
in
fact
the
range
is
acceptable.
in
that
case
it
was
25,000
people.
there
were
2,260
below
the
ideal
district
size,
and
13,542
above
the
ideal
district
size.
so
the
total
range
of
deviation
was
5.97
percent.
more
important,
however,
is
the
fact
that
in
kirkpatrick
that
is
when
this
court
first
with
precision
and
particularity
described
a
method
that
was
going
to
be
utilized
in
determining
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
apportionment
was
capable
of
being
accepted
constitutionally.
the
court
then
went
on
in
1973
to
white
v.
weiser,
as
i
am
certain
you
are
all
aware,
and
in
that
case
disapproved
plans
that
provided
for
a
deviation
in
the
range
of
4.13
percent
and
one
that
also
provided
for
a
deviation,
a
total
range
of
deviation
of
0.284
percent
in
favor
of
one
that
provided
a
total
deviation
of
696
people,
or
a
deviation,
a
total
range
of
deviation
of
0.149
percent.
and
then
of
course
in
karcher
we
know
precisely
what
occurred,
that
there
was
in
fact
an
ideal
district
size
determined,
then
the
range
was
determined,
and
the
court
affirmed
the
district
court's
order
striking
down
that
districting
plan
which
had
less
than
1
percent
in
total
deviation.
now
lest
anyone
question
whether
or
not
in
fact
this
has
remained
the
principle
and
the
method
employed
by
this
court,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
board
of
estimate
of
the
city
of
new
york
v.
morris
in
1989.
and
in
that
particular
case
the
court
once
again
pointed
out
that
the
guarantee
of
1
person,
one
vote
extended
to
local
government
apportionment
as
well
as
to
congressional
and
state
districting
plans.
and
quoting
daniel
webster
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
right
to
choose
a
representative
is
every
man's
portion
of
sovereign
power,
and
that
the
electoral
system
should
strive
to
make
each
citizen
equal.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
that
is
precisely
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
marc
racicot
there
certainly
is,
justice
scalia,
inequity
built
into
the
system
because
of
those
provisions
that
require
at
least
one
to
be
provided
every
state,
and
one,
and
not
having
the
possibility
of
crossing
state
boundaries.
but
just
because
there
is
a
basic
level
of
inequity,
in
our
judgment
does
not
allow
us
to
proceed
further
with
producing
further
inequities.
and
i
think
that's
precisely
what
we're
talking
about
here
before
the
court
today,
is
what
method
is
it
that's
going
to
be
utilized?
what
is
the
one
that
not
only
reflects
the
constitutional
mandate,
but
also
makes
common
sense
and
is
easily
understood
and
is
the
only
one
that
measures
the
number
of
people
per
representative?
mr.
marc
racicot
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
is
the
question
in
this
case.
and
quite
obviously
if
this
court
determines
that
to
be
the
case,
then
i
think
that
we
have
to
take
another
look
at
state
districting
responsibilities
as
well
because
we
certainly
have
not
allowed
them
to
do
that
in
that
context.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
think
your
point
is
well
taken,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact
they
are
not
inequities.
they
provide
a
basic
level
of
equality,
and
then
there
is
of
course
that
discretionary
area
beyond
50
and
up
to
a
maximum
wherein
congress
is
allowed
to
achieve
equality
by
a
method
that
is
consistent
with
the
constitution,
with
common
sense,
and
with
this
court's
rulings.
and
what
we
are
alleging
is
that
in
fact
that
the
method
that
is
presently
being
used,
because
it
measures
relative
equality,
it
measures
a
relative
share
in
a
representative.
where
in
the
constitution,
where
in
this
court's
decision
does
one
find
the
provision
that
people
are
entitled
only
to
relative
equality
or
to
a
relative
share
in
a
representative?
we
haven't
measured
shares
in
representatives
throughout
our
history.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes,
sir.
mr.
marc
racicot
it
would.
and
that
is
why,
although
montana
certainly
is
presented
in
this
instance
as
being
somewhat
selfish
or
interested
only
in
its
own
developments,
and
quite
obviously
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
we're
concerned
about,
but
we're
also
deeply
concerned
about
what
it
is
that
sustains
us
in
principle
in
this
particular
area
that
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
began
developing
in
1964,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
and
it
has
become
more
refined
over
the
course
of
time.
and
there
were
certainly
those
who
wondered
whether
in
fact
it
was
the
proper
course
to
pursue
at
every
junction.
but
it
has
produced,
i
think
over
the
long
haul,
equality
within
our
voting
systems
across
the
united
states
of
america.
and
as
justice
white
noted
in
morris
in
1989,
and
i
quote,
the
formula
for
measuring
constitutionality,
in
other
words
he
said
calculating
deviation
from
the
ideal
has
been
utilized
without
exception
since
1971.
the
method
presently
being
used
does
not
calculate
from
the
ideal
population.
it
measures
in
terms
of
relative
equality.
so
i--
mr.
marc
racicot
--your
honor,
i
believe
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
dean
method
complies
with
the
constitution.
whether
or
not
another
one
could
be
developed,
quite
obviously
i
do
not
know.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
believe
so,
yes,
sir,
even
if
it
disenfranchises--
mr.
marc
racicot
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
the
most
easily
understood...
yes,
there
is,
sir.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
the
most
easily
understood
is
the
dean
method,
the
method
of
harmonic
means,
because
it
deals--
mr.
marc
racicot
--perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
i
phrased
it
that
the
result
is
most
easily
understood,
because
what
it
seeks
to
do
is
measure
absolute
equality,
not
relative
equality.
and
that,
i
guess
in
my
judgment,
is
the
most
easily
understood
result.
i
think
it's
also
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
with
this
court's
rulings.
mr.
marc
racicot
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
system
was
set
up
that
that
was
obviously
the
product
of
a
great
compromise,
and
the
system
was
set
up
so
that
states,
the
corporate
entities,
would
be
represented,
and
then
in
the
house
where
people
would
be
represented.
and
that's
why
this
is
so
incredibly
important.
i
don't
think
that
one
can
fairly
and
completely
understand
what
it
is
like
to
be
disadvantaged
in
this
particular
arena
until
such
time
as
you
personally
experience
it.
and
quite
frankly,
that
at
that
point
in
time,
as
i
believe
mr.
wilson
pointed
out
at
the
convention,
indicated
that
waters
of
bitterness
flow
from
unequal
representation.
and
quite
honestly
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
a
river
of
equality
that
has
been
demanded
by
this
court,
and
the
tributaries
are
the
states
and
local
government,
but
it
is
congress
that
sits
at
the
headwaters.
and
unless
we
require
of
congress
the
same
standard
that
we
require
of
the
states,
how
is
it
that
we
can
expect
the
system
to
be
equal?
so
if
we're
going
to
allow
for
the
method
presently
there,
and
whatever
happens
in
this
courtroom
and
ultimately
the
decision
of
this
court
is
going
to
say
something
to
congress
and
to
the
members
of
this
union.
and
if
montana's
position
is
upheld
and
the
district
court
judgment
is
affirmed
it
will
say,
i
believe,
that
the
same
rules
apply
to
congress,
they
go
from
the
school
house
to
the
court
house
to
the
state
house
to
congress.
and
if
it
is
reversed
it
will
say
that
congress
can
play
by
a
different
set
of
rules,
that
it
does
in
fact,
as
the
solicitor
has
recommended,
have
unfettered
discretion
in
spite
of
what's
demanded
of
the
states.
so
i
believe
painstaking
precision
in
the
drawing
of
congressional
district
boundaries
by
the
states
is
going
to
be
hollow
indeed
if
apportionment
at
the
national
level
is
poisoned.
the
court
has
not
tolerated
of
the
states
that
they
simply
provide
relatively
equal
amount
of
equality.
they
require
that
they
do
that
with
precision.
thank
you.
