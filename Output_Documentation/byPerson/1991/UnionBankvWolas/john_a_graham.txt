mr.
john
a.
graham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
proper
interpretation
and
application
of
section
547(c)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
section
547(c)(2)
is
one
of
several
statutory
limitations
on
a
bankruptcy
trustee's
right
to
recover
payments
from
creditors,
and
it
protects
ordinary
course
of
business
payments.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
exempts
all
ordinary
course
payments,
and
the
statute
does
not
limit
its
protection
to
any
particular
class
or
type
of
creditor.
we
submit
that
the
statute
must
control
the
result
in
this
case,
because
this
is
not
one
of
those
rare
cases
where
the
literal
words
of
the
statute
are
in
conflict
with
congressional
intent.
i
also
submit
that
this
is
one
of...
this
is
a
very
straightforward
plain
meaning
case,
because
what
is
different
in
this
case,
as
opposed
to
some
of
the
other
court
cases,
is
that
congress
amended
the
statute
and
deleted
a
specific
time
restriction
which
was
contained
in
the
1978
bankruptcy
code.
under
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
payments
were
only
protected
if
they
were
made
within
45
days
of
when
the
debt
was
incurred.
under--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--$7
million.
mr.
john
a.
graham
yes,
for
union
bank,
which
is
a
large
commercial
lender--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--the
statute
requires
it
to
be
in
the
ordinary
course
of
both
the
borrower
and
the
lender.
mr.
john
a.
graham
that
would
be
a
factual
issue
that
would
need
to
be
determined
in
the
trial
court.
it
is
this--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--then
i
would
say
that
as
to
that
particular
corporation
or
business'
operation
it
was
not
ordinary.
but
the
statute
in
this
case,
was
determined
by
the
ninth
circuit
not
to
apply
to
any
long-term
plan.
mr.
john
a.
graham
i
do
agree
with
your
honor
that
there
is
a
standard
of
ordinariness
that
must
be
analyzed
on
a
factual
basis.
mr.
john
a.
graham
that's
correct,
and
i
would
turn...
just
for
example...
to
black's
law
dictionary
that
says
something
that
is
ordinary
is
normal
and
customary,
and
not
characterized
by
peculiar
or
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
john
a.
graham
then
i
believe
that
if
it
was
customary
for
that
type
of
debtor
to
borrow
money
and
pay
by
balloon
payment,
that
it
would
not
be
considered
to
be
unusual
and
out
of
the
ordinary
course.
mr.
john
a.
graham
yes,
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
an
analysis
both
of...
both
of
what
occurs
in
the
industry,
and
possibly
what
was
proper
and
appropriate
to
this
particular
business...
for
instance,
measuring
their
net
worth,
and
an
examination
of
their
balance
sheet
at
that
time.
mr.
john
a.
graham
no,
i...
in
answering
the
other
justice's
question,
i
thought
what
i
was
saying
is
you
would
have
to
test
it
from
a
factual
circumstance,
by
examining
the
particular
business.
for--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--and
i
would
agree--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--i
would
agree
with
your
point.
for
instance,
many
individuals
only
take
out
one,
large
mortgage
to
buy
their
home.
mr.
john
a.
graham
yet
that
would
not
be
considered
to
be
unusual
for
that
particular
individual
to
buy
a
home
and
incur
a
large
amount
of
debt
for
his
personal
residence.
mr.
john
a.
graham
yes,
i
agree,
so
long
as
that
particular
business,
for
instance,
let's
say,
only
needed
one
large
working
capital
loan.
so
long
as
other
businesses
of
that
type
also
needed
one
working
capital
loan,
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
it
unusual
or
out
of
the
ordinary.
but
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
ruled,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
no
long-term
lender
was
entitled
to
protections
of
the
statute...
i
don't
think
because
they
concluded
that
it
was
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
they
did
not
make
a
factual
determination
that
this
particular
loan
was
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
they
simply
concluded,
on
what
a...
we
submit
is
a
very,
inadequate
legislative
history,
that
congress
could
not
have
possibly
intended
to
extend
the
protection
of
this
statute
to
long-term
lenders.
the
critical
language
of
the
statute,
which
i
think
the
court
obviously
needs
to
focus
on,
is
as
follows,
quote,
"a
debt
incurred
by
the
debtor
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
or
financial
affairs.
"
and
we
submit
that
there
really
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
qualify
the
word
"debt",
or
to
guess
at
legislative
intent
as
to
what
congress
meant
by
the
word
"debt".
and
that
is
because
debt
is
a
statutorily
defined
term
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
it
means
liability
on
a
claim...
which
surely
includes
long-term
lenders.
the
court
need
not
make
up
a
special
definition
of
debt
for
this
particular
statute.
turning
to
the
judicial...
to
the
sometimes
exception
that
there
might
be
a
judicial
rule
of
longstanding
or
pre-code
practice,
which
would
require
this
court
to
look
in
a
different
direction
than
the
plain
meaning.
for
80
years,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
there
was
never
any
distinguishment
between
long-term
lenders
and
short-term
lenders.
and
there
was
never
any
reason,
nor
was
there
any
purpose
in
the
statute
to
distinguish
the
protections
and...
at
the
expense
of
long-term
lenders.
all
creditors
were
protected,
regardless
of
the
time
limits
of
their
debt.
when
congress
eliminated
the
45-day
rule,
what
it
really
did
was
return
bankruptcy
law
to
a
traditional
state
of
affairs
that
had
existed
for
80
years.
also,
most
interestingly,
many
cases
below,
and
commoners
have
put
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
only
trade
creditors
and
consumer
lenders
testified
at
the
hearings
from
1980
to
1984.
and
they
say
that
because
other
groups
didn't
testify,
there
is
no
reason
to
extend
the
protections
to
those
groups.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
trustee's
position
that
divining
legislative
intent
by
conducting
a
head
count
of
the
witnesses
that
appeared
before
congress
is
really
an
absurd
way
of
analyzing
legislative
history.
the
fact
that
one
group
sat
on
the
sidelines
and
chose
not
to
participate,
either
voluntarily
or
by
subpoena
to
be
called
and
testify,
doesn't
prove
anything.
in
fact,
in
this
example,
the
long-term
lenders
may
have
been
quite
content
to
sit
on
the
sidelines,
since
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
was
going
to
plainly
protect
them.
if
this
court
were
to
part
from
the
plain
meaning,
it
would
also
have
to
deal
with
another
vice
that
is
not
solved
by
the
trustee's
position.
from
the
inception
of
congress'
analysis
in
1980
to
change
the
statute,
the
first
group
that
triggered
that
review
was
the
commercial-paper
issuers.
and
they
complained
that
the
statute,
which
had
an
artificial
time
limit
of
45
days,
was
excluding
them
from
the
protections
of
the
ordinary
course
rule.
and
throughout
the
4-year
period,
it
was
made
clear
that
those
commercial
paper
issuers
were
to
be
protected
by
the
new
statute...
in
fact,
so
much
so,
that
senators
dole
and
deconcini,
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
made
statements
to
that
effect
right
before
the
legislation
was
passed.
the
problem
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
part
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
you
would
be
required
to
write
in
another
special
exemption
to
the
statute
for
commercial
paper
issuers.
the
1984
congress
made
it
clear
that
its
goal
was
to
promote
and
protect
norr
lized
business
dealings.
mr.
john
a.
graham
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
did
follow
a
4-year
legislative
review
in
which
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
which
became
effective
in
october
of
1979...
less
than
1
year
later
complaints
were
laid
at
the
doorstep
of
congres
and
the
investigation
and
congressional
hearings
ensued
to
determine
what
to
do
about
the
statute.
it
is
petitioner's
view
that
there
is
no
reason
to
exclude
long-term
lenders
because
the
goal
of
the
1984
congress
was
to
promote
and
protect
normalized
business
dealings,
and
that...
they
held
that
that
could
be
accomplished
while
discouraging
unusual
action
in
a
race
to
the
courthouse.
i
would
point--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--the
new
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
john
a.
graham
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
know
if--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--right,
and
while
some
people
complain
about
that
policy,
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
very
creditors
who
would
be
protected
by
collectively
bringing
in
preference
payments
and
distributing
them
equally,
were
the
same
group
that
went
to
the
1984
congress
and
said
this
is
not
a
protection
that
we
seek.
we
would
prefer
to
have
our
normal...
normal
business
transactions
immune
from
preference
of
tax,
so
long
as
they're
within
the
ordinary
course
of
both
the
debtor
and
the
creditor's
business.
mr.
john
a.
graham
well,
i
imagine
that's--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--so
to
speak.
i
think,
though,
that
the
concern
of
congress
was
that
the
statute,
as
written
with
the
artificial
limitation,
was
requiring
businessmen
to
change
their
practices.
and
that
was
the
problem
that
the
congress
addressed.
we
submit
that
since
the
key
goal
was
to
protect
and
promote
normalized
business...
dealings,
and
to
prevent
a
race
to
the
courthouse,
it
makes
absolutely
no
sense
to
carve
out
and
exclude
long-term
lenders
from
that
process.
long-term
lenders
usually
hold
the
power
to
bring
a
debtor's
business
to
a
halt.
in
most
cases,
there
is
one
or
two
key
long-term
lenders.
and
if
the
goal
is
to
prevent
a
race
to
the
courthouse,
why
exclude
that
lender
from
the
protections
of
the
statute?
at
that
point,
you've
taken
away
the
very
incentive
that
congress
gave
that
long-term
lender
to
deal
with
the
debtor
on
a
day-to-day,
regular
basis.
if
he's
not
going
to
get
to
keep
his
regular
ordinary
payments,
why
not
call
the
loan
covenant?
why
not
take
more
aggressive
action?
i
would
also
point
out
that
although
there
is
much
said
about
the
idea
of
encouraging
trade
creditors
to
deal
with
the
debtor
on
a
repetitive
basis,
and
to
supply
goods
and
services
to
that
debtor,
that
is
a
policy
which
is
covered
under
subsection
c(4)
of
547.
in
that
subsection,
congress
permitted
a
creditor
who
may
have
received
a
preferential
payment,
that
if
he
continues
to
do
business
with
the
debtor,
he
will
be
able
to
offset
any
future
goods
or
services
he
delivers
to
the
debtor
against
that
preference
liability.
so
there
is
a
specific
statutory
exception
which
responds
to
the
concern
and
the
policy
of
promoting
creditors
and
trade
suppliers
to
do
business
with
the
debtor.
i
also
think
that
the
court
need
not
attempt
to
try
to
reconcile
the
1984
congress'
different
view
of
what
was
the
more
important
policy.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
since
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous,
if
the
court
attempts
to
reconcile
the
1978
congress'
policy,
which
there...
which
favored
more
than
quality
of
distribution
policy,
it
puts
the
court
in
the
improper
role,
i
believe,
of
trying
to
determine
whether
the
1984
congress
allegedly
forgot
in
passing
this
statute,
and
deleting
the
artificial
limitation
to
harken
back
to
what,
in
1978,
was
considered
to
be
a
more
important
policy.
we
submit
that
the
case
of
west
virginia
v.
casey
states
that
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
should
not
do,
where
the
statute
is
clear,
and
therefore
there's
no
reason.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
cannot
be
faulted
for
literalism
in
applying
the
statute.
the
words
which
created
the
distinction
and
previously
allowed
trade
creditors
to
benefit
and
sometimes
other
creditors
not
has
been
deleted
from
the
statute.
once
that
artificial
time
limit
was
removed,
the
statute
applies
to
all
creditors.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
should
reject
the
trustee's
attempt
to
add
words
back
into
the
statute
which
would
change
the
statutory
definition
of
the
word
debt.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
would
reserve
my
time.
mr.
john
a.
graham
yes.
mr.
john
a.
graham
in
this--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--let
me
answer
the
question
factually,
first,
as
to
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
revolving
line
of
credit...
although
much
larger,
very...
similar
to
a
person
who
has
a
bank
master
charge.
the
choice
of
whether
to
pay
just
interest
or
also
pay
principal
down,
in
any
particular
month,
was
the
borrower's
choice
by
the
express
terms
of
the
document.
and
so
in
this
case,
the
payments
which
are
at
issue
happen
to
be
interest
payments,
since
the
loan
was
not
what
we
would
call
a
fully
amortized
loan.
when
it
came
due,
at
the
end
of
its
term,
the
principal
would
have
to
be
paid
in
full,
or
the
borrower
would
have
to
renegotiate
for
a
renewal
or
an
extension
of
the
loan.
however,
if
i
might
add
a
point,
the
american
bankers
association
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
and
made
the
point
that
the
debt
of
interest,
which
is
distinguished
from
the
debt
of
principal,
probably
was
a
short-term
debt,
because
it
was
incurred
month
to
month
and
paid
month
to
month
on
a
regular
basis.
but
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
that
has
been
presented
on
the
writ
for
certiorari
is
whether
long-term
lenders,
whether
they
receive
ordinary
payments
of
interest
or
principal,
whether
they
are
excluded
from
the
protection
of
the
statute
simply
because
someone
has
divined
legislative
intent
based
on
who
testified
and
some
very
unpersuasive
statements
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
a.
graham
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
a.
graham
well,
i
can
refer
to
definitions
of
what
is
not
considered
ordinary...
things
that
are
exceptional,
unusual,
not
customary.
but
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
the
word
"ordinary",
you
have
to
put
it
in
a
factual
situation
in
order
to
measure
that
ordinariness.
and
i
thought
that
one
of
the
other
justice's
question
regarding
a
large
business,
general
motors,
for
instance,
obviously
a
$7
million
loan
cannot
be
considered
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
company
of
that
size.
and
later
i
will
reintroduce
myself
to
mr.
wolas,
because
i
am
one
bank
lawyer
who
would
not
require,
necessarily,
great
formality
in
loaning
$7
million
to
general
motors.
i
mean,
that
simply...
if
it
was
in
accordance
with
ordinary
business
terms...
you
know,
there
is
a
third
part
of
the
test
that
would
assist
mr.
wolas
factually
in
a
particular
case.
and
that
is,
that
the
loan
must
also
be
in
accordance
with
ordinary
business
terms.
so
if
you
had
a
$7
million
loan
to
general
motors
that
was
large
enough
to
support
that
type
of
loan,
and
the
bank
was
a
large
commercial
bank,
where
its
lending
limits
were
not
being
exceeded
and
there
was
no
fraud
at
the
bank
level,
then
you
would
still
have
to
go
to
the
third
part
of
the
test,
which
is
whether
the
loan
was
being
made...
being
paid...
being
made
in
accordance
with
ordinary
business
terms.
mr.
john
a.
graham
most
probably
not...
if
the
facts
show
that
one
of
the
reasons
the
bank
was
asking
for
security
was
a
concern
with
respect
to
the
credit.
in
fact,
the
five
cases
cited
by
mr.
wolas
to
prove
that
there's
a
judicial
history,
that
in
some
of
those
cases,
the
action
of
the
creditor
was
in
response
to
a
declining
financial
situation
of
the
debtor.
and
the
attempt
to
gain
advantage
by
changing
the
terms
of
the
loan
or
changing
the
rules
of
the
loan,
clearly...
in
those
cases
the
trustee
would
be
entitled
to
recover
the
preference.
congress
sought
to
promote
normalized
business
relationships.
but
when
those
transactions
deviate
from
the
ordinary
course...
including
if
they're
not--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--usually
it
is,
if
there's
no
reason
why...
acceptable
reason
to
the
lender
why
the
borrower
is
not
making
the
payment.
in
fact--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--well,
the
test--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--well,
there
are
three
balls
here,
justice
scalia.
it
has
to
be
incurred
by
both
the
debtor
and
creditor
in
the
ordinary
course,
and
it
also
has...
the
payment
has
to
be
made
in
the
ordinary
course.
mr.
john
a.
graham
that's
correct,
so
long
as
the
terms
of
the
loan
are
also
according
to
ordinary
business
terms.
mr.
john
a.
graham
i
believe--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--yes,
i
do.
and
i
believe
there
are
actually
two
parts
to
the
test.
as
to
a
particular
debtor,
the
trial
court
would
have
to
test
whether
or
not
the
size
of
the
loan
was
ordinary
and
customary
as
to
that
debtor's
balance
sheet.
for
instance,
$7
million
would
not
be
extraordinary
for
general
motors.
but
if
for
a
small
manufacturer
who
might
borrow
60
or
70
percent
of
its
asset
base,
there
might
be
a
question
about
whether
that
was
in
the
ordinary
course
of
that
particular
business.
i
believe
there
would
also
be
a
secondary
test,
which
is
that
is
to
whether
or
not
in
the
business
community
of
that
type
of
debtor,
whether
that
type
of
loan
was
out
of
the
ordinary
course
and
unusual.
and
the
fact
that
there
are--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--yes.
and
i
believe
that
with
respect
to
mr.
wolas'
statement
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
judicially
recognized
exception
of
longstanding,
which
he
calls
the
current
expense
rule,
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
there
are
a
smattering
of
cases
referenced
in
colliers
where
the
courts,
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act,
struggled
with
certain
types
of
debts,
in
unique
circumstances.
the
classic
example
is
the
example
of
the
landlord
who
is
usually
paid
at
the
first
day
of
the
month,
as
opposed
to
the
last
day.
and
sometimes
in
those
cases,
he
received
the
payment
in
the
middle
of
the
month
or
towards
the
end
of
the
month.
and
the
court,
not
wanting
to
declare
that
an
act
of
bankruptcy,
or
the
court
not
wanting
to
consider
that
preferential,
said
that
that
was
a
current
expense
and
not
for
an
antecedent
debt.
those
cases
as
focused
on
the
concept
of
what
was
antecedent.
and
in
the
new
bankruptcy
code,
you
have
section
(c)(1),
which
says
that
the
payment,
the
exchange
between
the
creditor
and
the
debtor,
does
not
have
to
be
precisely
contemporaneous.
it
has
to
be
substantially
contemporaneous.
and
if
those
cases
were
presented,
there
would
have
to
be
a
factual
determination
as
to
the
debtor
and
creditor...
whether
it
was
substantially
contemporaneous
within
the
conduct
of
their
business.
but
i
would
invite
the
court
to
look
at
those
cases,
and
you
will
discover
that
they
dealt
with
either
rent,
or
they
dealt
with
creditors
who
had
a
given
value
to
the
debtor,
after
receiving
a
preferential
payment.
and
the
court
did
not
want
to
assess
that
creditor
with
the
full
preference
he
had
received
before.
for
example,
if
he
had
received
$10,000
on
an
antecedent
claim,
but
then
had
re-delivered
$5,000
of
merchandise
to
the
debtor,
the
court
struggled
with
the
concept
by
saying,
well,
he
was
assisting
the
debtor
in
the
current
operations,
and
therefore
would
not
be
subject
to
preference
liability
for
the
full
$10,000.
that
concept
is
embodied
in
section
(c)(4)
of
547,
in
which
we
bankruptcy
lawyers
tend
to
call
the
net
result
rule.
if
you
have
received
$100,000
preference
payment,
but
the
debtor
says
ship
me
some
goods,
i'm
in
trouble,
i
need
some
additional
goods...
if
you
ship
the
debtor
$60,000
of
goods,
you
will
only
be
subject
to
the
trustee's
right
to
recover
$40,000.
that
concept
is
already
embodied
in
the
1980...
has
been
embodied
throughout
the
1978
bankruptcy
code.
and
there
really
is
no
judicial
rule
of
longstanding.
in
fact,
search
as
you
may,
you
will
never
find
the
word
1978
legislative
history,
let
alone
the
1984
legislative
history.
the
result
in
this
case
should
be
controlled
by
the
case
of
west
virginia
v.
casey.
because
what
mr.
wolas
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
try
to
reconcile
his
view
of
the
1984
statute
with
a
prior
congressional
intent.
and
i
think
in
the
west
virginia
case
the
court
pointed
out
that
it
is
not
the
role
of
the
court
to
try
to
mesh
inconsistent
legislation
between
a
past
congress'
enactment
and
a
new
congress'
enactment...
unless
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
then,
when
it's
ambiguous,
you
have
no
choice
but
to
go
into
the
two
statutes
and
try
to
reconcile
them
and
make
sense
out
of
them.
but
there's
no
reason
to
do
that
here,
because
the
statute
is
plain
on
its
face.
there
was
a
simple
time
limitation
which
created
this
statute's
artificial
limitation
to
most...
which
allowed
most
trade
creditors
to
be
protected
under
the
old
law.
when
congress
deleted
that
statement,
there
really
was
nothing
further
to
prevent
the
statute
to
be
applied
to
all.
finally,
if
i
have
been
mistaken
in
my
brief
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
1990...
the
1898
bankruptcy
act
did
not
draw
a
distinction
between
avoidability
of
preferential
payments
on
short-term
debt
and
avoidability
of
preferential
payments
on
long-term
debt,
then
so
is
the
respondent...
at
page
16,
footnote
35.
he
says
the
same
thing.
we
both
agree
that
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act--
mr.
john
a.
graham
--we
are
both
right,
your
honor.
[laughter]
and
that
could
have
been
the
only
way
my
answer
came
out.
mr.
john
a.
graham
it's
very
clear
that
there
was
never
a
distinction
drawn
on
the
classification
of
a
debtor,
whether
they
were
long
term
or
short
term.
the
fact
that
for
1
year
there
was
a
statute
that
created
an
artificial
limitation,
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
stampede
to
congress
to
get
that
statute
changed,
the
court
should
follow
the
plain
meaning
of
that
new
statute.
thank
you.
