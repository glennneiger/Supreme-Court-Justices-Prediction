justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
narrowed
the...
preferences
that
could
be
recovered.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they...
so
be
it.
that's...
they
intended
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
we
would
rather
enjoy
preferences
than
have...
having...
have
them
be
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
so
to
speak.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
apply
your
argument
to
both
the
interest
payments
and
payments
of
the
principal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
so
you
say
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
that
when
you
pay
interest
you're
paying
right
now
for
the
use
of
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
you're
keeping
the
loan
from
being
called.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
paying
your
interest,
and
you're
getting
the
use
of
money
for
another
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
isn't
that
just
like
buying
anything
else,
for
cash?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
cover
the
payments
on
principal.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
cover
the
principal,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
just
have
put
in
an...
in
a
parenthesis,
and
said
we
really
mean
what
this...
what
these
words
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
use
these...
you
don't
say
that
it's
an
irrational
construction
of
the
statute,
just
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
because
of
history.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
isn't
any
legislative
history
here
to
speak
of.
there's
just
history.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly,
if
you've
got
an
acceleration
clause
in
your
promissory
note,
and
there's
a
failure
to
make
an
installment
payment,
it's
ordinary
business
course
to
accelerate.
