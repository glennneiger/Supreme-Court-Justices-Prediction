mr.
herbert
wolas
if
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice:
we
are
here
to
determine
whether
or
not,
when
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1974,
it
intended
to
change,
in
totality,
the
preference
rules.
mr.
herbert
wolas
'84.
i
stand
corrected.
between
1979
and
1984,
every
bankruptcy
court
in
the
united
states
understood
that
when
they
were
looking
at
section
67...
547(c)(2),
that
statute
incorporated
what
was
known
as
the
current
expense
exception
to
the
preference
recovery
act.
that
is,
everybody
knew
that
these
short-term,
in-and-out
transactions
whereby
suppliers
of
goods,
utility
companies,
insurance
premium
payments,
were
not
within
the
preference
provisions;
that
these
were
part
of
the
two-step
discussion
of
contemporary
exchanges
which
do
not
diminish
the
estate.
likewise,
the
current
exchange...
current
expense
theory
provided
assets
for
distribution
to
creditors.
the
question
we
have
here,
is
is
the
ron
pair
decision
applicable
to
this
case.
and
i
suggest
that
this
statute,
the
1984
statute,
is...
has
not
been
written
on
a
clean
slate.
it
carries
with
it
a
long
line
of
judicial
and
statutory
interpretation.
we
should
remember
that
547(c)(2)
is
part
of
a
larger
statutory
scheme.
you
start
off
with
the
basic...
concept
of
547(b),
which
is
the
preference
rule.
and
the
rule
there
says
very
clearly
that
if
you
received
a
preference
within
90
days
of
bankruptcy,
while
the
debtor
was
insolvent,
you
have
to
put
the
money
back
in
the
pot,
and
everybody
shares
in
the
dollars.
the
547(c)
exceptions
are
the
exceptions
to
the
general
rule.
if
we
are
to
look
at
the
exceptions,
exceptions
are
looked
at
narrowly
and
precisely.
we
have
all
kinds
of
exceptions,
very
precise
exceptions.
we
should
remember
that
union
bank
has
made
one
major
mistake
in
its
brief.
i
quote
it.
at
page
12,
it
makes
a
statement,
that
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898
protected
most
ordinary
course
payments
as
a
preference,
and
that
did
not
distinguish
between
short-term
and
long-term
debt.
half
that
statement
is
correct.
the
statute
did
not
distinguish
between
long-term
and
short-term
debt.
the
statute
did
not
protect
ordinary
course
payments.
a
preference
was
a
preference
no
matter
what.
and
this
is
shown
to
us
in
the...
this
court's
decision
in
national
city
v.
hodgkiss.
that's
a
1913
decision,
justice
holmes.
that
case
involved
a
day
loan.
the
day
loan
was
made
to
the
broker
at
10:00
a.m.
in
the
morning
for
the
purposes
of
financing
an
underwriting.
the
broker
became
insolvent
at
noon.
at
2:00,
the
bank
took
a
preference,
took
security;
at
4:00,
in
bankruptcy,
involuntary.
the
decision
of
that
court:
it
was
a
day
loan;
it
was
a
preference...
short
term
or
long
term.
it
was
paid
in
the
ordinary
course.
it
was,
the
bank
got
a
preference.
right
after
that
we
see
that
the
creation
of
two
separate,
overlapping
and
similar
theories.
one
is
the...
contemporaneous
exchange
concept.
and
that's
a
concept
where
dollars
came
in,
and
dollars
went
out.
and
nobody
really
got
hurt.
property
came
in
and
dollars
went
out.
the
debtor
was
really
the
same,
and
creditors
were
not...
were
not
adversely
affected.
this
shows
up
in
the
case
of
dean
v.
davis,
a
1917
decision
of
this
court.
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
loan
of
money;
a
mortgage
was
signed
and
security
given.
the
mortgage...
the
loan
was
on
day
1;
the
mortgage
was
signed
on
day
7;
the
mortgage
was
recorded
and
perfected
against
creditors
on
day
8.
the
court,
in
that
case,
bent
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
said,
well,
it
was
substantially
contemporaneous;
nobody
was
really
hurt.
we
allow
that
transaction.
subsequent
to
1917,
we
see
developing
two,
judicially-created
exceptions
to
the
bankruptcy
preference
laws.
one
is
the
one
i
just
talked
about.
the
other
one
is
the
current
expense
exception.
and
that
current
expense
exception
first
started
in
the
world
of
involuntary
bankruptcies.
mr.
herbert
wolas
it
was
not
statutory,
your
honor.
it
is
judicially
created.
because
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
would
not
make
an
exception
for
either
current
expense
or
for
substantially
contemporaneous.
contemporaneous
is
protected,
but
substantially
is,
you
know,
just
a
little
bit
pregnant,
and
how
far
down
the
stream
are
you
out
of
luck,
when
it's
not
any
longer
contemporaneous.
so,
we
have
developing
this
current
expense
exception.
and
the
current
expense
exception
deals
with
payment
for
wages;
it
deals
with
the
suppliers
receiving
money
for
inventory
just
supplied,
payments
to
the
utility
companies,
payments
to
the
rent,
the
landlord.
and
there's
a
whole
line
of
cases
talking
about
the
current
expense,
and
they
use
words
like
it
was
paid
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
that
start
off
in
the
involuntary
area,
and
it
was
switched.
let
me
back
up.
started
in
the
involuntary
area,
because
to
put
a
debtor
into
bankruptcy,
you
had
to
allege
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
and
the
most
common
act
of
bankruptcy
was
a
preference.
so
you
had
to
prove
that
the
payment
made
to
the
utility
company
or
for
the
wages
was
a
preference.
the
court
did
not
accept
that.
it
started
off
saying
but
these
are
necessary.
they
enhance
the
debtor.
there
was
no
diminution
of
the
estate.
we
preserve...
we
protect
the
transaction.
debtor,
you're
not
in
involuntary
bankruptcy.
this,
then,
got
switched
over.
and
then
in
the
cases
where
the
creditor
was
sued
because
of
the
alleged
preference,
the
payment,
the
creditor
defended,
hey,
i
was
different;
i
provided
inventory,
ordinary
course.
i
provided
utilities,
labor.
and
that's
where
the
current
expense
exception
came
about.
we
have,
now,
a
study
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
from
1970
on
up
through
1979,
with
the
intention
of
changing
the
bankruptcy
laws
dramatically.
what
they
didn't
change
dramatically
were
the
preference
statutes.
in
the
bankruptcy
commission
report
to
congress
in
1973,
they
suggested
to
congress
a
couple
of
revisions:
(1)
to
make
the
law
easy
to
understand,
and
(2)
to
make
it
fair.
the
easy-to-understand
portion
was
they
eliminated
the
reasonable
cost
to
believe
that
the
debtor
was
insolvent.
and
they
put...
they
also
made
the
presumption
the
debtor
was
insolvent
when
it
took
place.
because
those
were
two
areas
that
were
subject
to
litigation.
you
had
a
swearing
contest
between
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
as
to
whether
or
not
the
creditor
should
have
known
the
debtor
was
insolvent,
had
reasonable
cause.
and
also,
the
evidentiary
problem
of
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
prove
insolvency
is
tough,
because
the
records
are
terrible.
so
now
we
have
a
presumption.
at
the
same
time,
the
bankruptcy
commission...
and
it
was
also
picked
up
in
the
proposed
judge's
bill...
recommended
the
incorporation
of
what
we
call
the
contemporaneous
exchange
exception,
and
the
current-expense
exception.
this
was
done
by
suggesting
to
congress
that
the
definition
of
antecedent
debt,
an
old
bill,
be
modified
to
read:
(1)
a
bill
that
was
paid
within
5
days
is
not
an
antecedent
debt;
(2)
personal
earning...
personal
services
were
not
an
antecedent
debt;
(3)
if
you
pay
the
utility
within
ninety
days,
that
was
not
an
antecedent
debt;
and
(4)
if
you
paid
for
inventory
which
was
purchased
under
ordinary
trade
terms
and
it
was
paid
for
in
90
days,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business...
that
was
included
in
the
suggested
language...
it
was
not
a
preference.
from
1973
to
1979,
because
the
congress
did
not
move
too
quickly,
there
were
numerous
hearings.
and
at
mock...
at
a
mockup...
a
number
of
mock-up
meetings...
the
intention
was
to
make
the
law
move
more
smoothly.
various
interests
said
(1)
90
days
was
too
long
on
protecting
the
sale
of
merchandise
and
the
utility
company.
also,
by
calling
out
utility
company,
and
calling
out
the
trade
creditor,
you
leave
other
people
who
are
current
suppliers
out
in
the
cold.
is
the
service
man
who
provides
you
xerox
paper,
is
this
inventory
of
the
business?
so
what
we
get
is
547(c)(1),
which
codifies
the
judicially-created,
contemporaneous-exchange
exception;
and
we
get
547(c)(2)
which
codifies
the
judicially
created
current-expense
exception.
but
the
drafters
wanted
to
make
life
easier.
they
said,
let's
give
everybody
a
bright-line
test
on
what
is
an
old
bill.
and
that
bright-line
test
is
45
days.
i'll
represent
to
this
court
that
every
bankruptcy
decision...
or
virtually
every
one...
from
1979
to
1984
fully
understood
that
547(c)(2)
was
a
codification
of
the
current
expense
exception...
every
case.
the
cases
that
the
union
bank
relies
on,
my
cases...
all
the
cases
in
the
middle
talk
about
did
1984
change
this
current
expense
exception.
now,
what
do
we
really
have?
in
the
1980...
'80,
'81,
'82,
'83...
three
groups
came
to
congress.
the
banks
didn't
come
to
congress,
because
they
didn't...
in
their
wildest
imagination...
think
they
were
going
to
be
exempt,
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
the
three
groups
that
came
to
congress
were
one,
the
trade
creditors.
and
they
said,
we've
got
a
problem.
45
days
as
a
bright-line
test
doesn't
work...
in
the
toy
business,
in
the
clothing
business,
in
the
sporting
goods
business...
dating
is
different.
you
ship
in
july,
and
you
pay
for
the
toys
the
day
after
christmas.
so
45
days
kills
those
people.
the
second
group
that
came
to
congress
was
the
lenders
to
individuals,
the
consumer
lenders.
and
they
said,
my
god,
we
know
we
make
long-term
debt,
and
we
know
we're
under-secured
most
of
the
time;
we've
lent
on
the
household
goods.
protect
us,
because
45
days
hurts
us;
we're
in
trouble
with
that.
who
else
came
to
congress?
the
commercial
paper
holders.
and
they
said,
you
know,
we've
got
a
problem.
commercial
paper
is
written
on
a
very
short-term
basis...
but
beyond
45
days.
if
you
look
at
the
statute
as
it's
written,
if
the
debtor
goes
insolvent,
we
have
a
give-back
problem,
okay?
mr.
herbert
wolas
unsecured
commercial
paper.
unsecured
commercial
paper...
let
me
take...
that's
the
easiest
one.
unsecured
commercial
paper
is
available
to
limited
companies.
only
the
biggest
and
the
best
can
deal
in
commercial
paper.
a
few
of
them
have
gone
insolvent.
we
have
a
terrible
economy.
but
generally,
the
rating
services
say
this
company
can
issue
commercial
paper,
and
it's
a
regular,
going
market.
when
the
statute
was
amended
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
the
question
was...
by
senator
dole
to
senator
deconcini...
does
this
statute
now,
protect
the
commercial
paper
holders?
and
deconcini
says
yes.
and
in
the
reading...
and
the
brief
quotes
the
exact
language,
and
i
won't
try
to
do
that...
but
the
essence
of
it
was,
yes.
and
he
wasn't
talking
about
whether
it's
long-term
debt
or
long...
or
short-term
debt.
what
he
said
was
in
the
buying
and
selling
of
commercial
paper
between
the
monied
people
and
the
debtor,
we
presume
that
this
is
done
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
of
both
the
commercial
paper
lender,
and
the
commercial
paper
borrower.
it
was
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
that
was
the
key
to
that.
with
reference
to--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--your
honor--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--justice
scalia,
in
chambers,
you
explain
that
to
us
very
carefully.
you
said,
and
i
quote
you,
"statutory
construction
is
a
holistic
endeavor.
"
then
you
went
on
to
say,
"a
major
change
in
existing
rules
would
not
likely
have
been
made
without
specific
provisions
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
"
"it
is
most
improbable
that
it
would
have
been
made
without
any
mention
in
the
legislative
history.
"
and
the
briefs
are
full
of
the
statement
that
there's
very
little
legislative
history
on
the
change
of,
quote,
"long-term"
or
"short-term
debt".
because
never,
in
their
wildest
dreams,
did
the
banks
think
that
this
change
was
being
made.
mr.
herbert
wolas
that
is
correct.
i
don't
disagree.
the
45-day
rule
is
gone.
but
was
the
statute
intended
to
change
and
to
emasculate
the
entire
preference
provisions
of
547(b),
because
if
this
statute
is
to
be
read
as
the
banks
would
like
it
read,
there
is
virtually
few
transactions
that
are
now
preferences.
and
here
then
we
have
the
exception
to
the
rule
swallowing
the
rule.
and
it's
gone.
and
that
is
the
real
problem.
it
is--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--oh,
principal
is
even
worse.
mr.
herbert
wolas
i
would
say
principal
and
interest
are
not
protected
under
the
bank--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
where
the
iowa
premium
court
went
astray.
you're
paying
for
a
debt
that
you
incur
when
you
made
the
loan.
mr.
herbert
wolas
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
wolas
no,
you've
already--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--one
could
say
that,
but
you've
already
obligated
yourself
for
the
debt--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--no,
if
the...
if
we
were
to
read
the
statute
the
way
the
bank
wants
us
to
read
the
statute--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--the
payment
of
principal
would
also--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--be
involved.
mr.
herbert
wolas
that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
wolas
that's
right;
that
is
correct.
but,
was
the
debt
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
business
of
the
debtor?
the
question
was
raised
about
a
long-term
mortgage
on
black
acre,
which
is
the
only
mortgage
that
that
business
makes.
if
it's
an
isolated
transaction,
i
would
say
it
is
not
in
the
ordinary
course.
if
it's
xyz
corporation,
that
has
50
locations,
and
historically
it
finances
each
of
those
pieces
of
property
with
a
mortgage,
a
different
argument
could
be
made.
in
this
case...
and
there's
no
dispute...
in
this
case,
(1)
it
was
a
one-loan
transaction
of
$7
million;
(2)
the
bank
procured
the
authority...
it's
in
the
brief...
to
tack
the
account.
it
took
the
money
out
of
the
account
by
itself.
it
didn't
need
the
debtor
to
pay
it.
it
controlled
the
date
it
got
paid.
now,
i
also
suggest
to
your
honor
that
bank
borrowings
are
not
ever
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
and
i
will
submit
to
this
panel...
to
this
court,
i
apologize...
that
there
isn't
a
bank
that
makes
a
loan
to
a
corporation
that
doesn't
require
that
corporation
to
execute
a
corporate
resolution.
why?
because
it's
not
in
the
ordinary
course.
corporate
resolutions
are
not
necessary
for
incurring
debt
for
trade,
landlords,
et
cetera.
section
364
of
the
bankruptcy
code
allows
a
trustee
or
debtor
in
possession
to
incur
debt
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
without
a
court
order.
i
will
submit
to
this
court
that
there
is
not...
there
is
not
a
bank
lawyer
in
the
united
states
that
would
allow
his
client
to
lend
money
to
a
debtor
without
a
court
order.
mr.
herbert
wolas
well,
i
don't
think
banks
are
so
fussy
these
days,
your
honor,
but
it's
quite
possible.
mr.
herbert
wolas
it's
quite
possible.
mr.
herbert
wolas
they...
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
that
it
makes
no
sense,
there
is
no
basis
in
the
statute
to
say
that
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
it
did,
when...
let
me...
i
apologize.
let
me
back
up.
i
believe
that
the
normal
rules
of
statutory
construction
is
that
if
congress
intends
to
change
a
major,
underlying
legal
theory,
it
does
so
precisely.
and
i
think
that
was
justice
blackmun's--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--the
theory
of
ordinary
course
is
what
is
necessary
to
keep
the
debtor
going
from
day
to
day:
the
purchase
of
inventory,
the
purchase
of
materials,
the
pur...
the
payment
of
labor,
the
payment
of
rent.
if
everything
else...
everything
the
debtor
does
is
ordinary
course.
borrowing
$7
million
from
the
bank,
if
that's
ordinary
course,
what
else
is
left
to
547(b)?
the
tail
destroys
the
dog.
mr.
herbert
wolas
well,
i
would
like
to
win
without
remand,
your
honor.
i
would
like
us
to
get
a
bright-line
test
from
this
court.
that's
the
hopeful
result.
because--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--there
is
a--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--assuming
your...
assuming
your
facts,
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
which
protected
lenders
in
this
situation.
i
don't
have
the
citation.
but
it
was
a
lender
who
was
a
real
estate
lender
and
did
numerous
real
estate
transactions.
and
in
that
case,
they
determined
that
this,
for
this
lender...
for
this
debtor,
it
was
its
ordinary
course
of
business.
so,
yes,
there
may
be
a
factual
step
that's
missing.
but
hopefully
we
got
this
far
to
get
a
bright-line
rule.
mr.
herbert
wolas
well,
those
are
the
problems.
we
look
at
the...
we
happen
to
look
at
everything
now
with
a
microscope,
which
we...
which
i
wish
we
would
have
looked
at
more
carefully
at
the
trial
court
level.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out,
if
i
might...
i
still
have
some
time
left...
that
the
cases
that
are...
that
supposedly
brought
us
here,
really
have
to
be
looked
at
much
more
carefully.
for
example,
iowa
premium.
iowa
premium,
the
court
didn't
deal
with
what
is
ordinary
course
of
business.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
was
stipulated
to,
that
the
transactions
were
in
the
nature
of
ordinary
course.
that
was
a
stipulated
issue.
the
iowa
premium
court,
in
my
opinion,
got
confused
over
the
45-day
period
and
how
you
counted
it
and
when
the
debt
arose.
that's
my
personal
opinion.
because
almost
all
of
the
cases
that
deal
with
when
was
debt
incurred
disagree
with
iowa
premium's
conclusion,
and
say
you
date
when
the
debt
was
incurred,
when
the
loan
was
made,
when
the
dollars
were
paid.
that's
when
the
asset
was
consumed.
and
the
interest
is
not
being
paid
today.
it
is...
it
was
being
paid
for
what
was
consumed
later.
that's
different
with...
from
the
inventory.
in
the
inventory
situation,
you're
paying
this
week
for
what
came
in
last
week
or
4
weeks
ago.
so
i
submit
that
iowa
premium
is
not
applicable
to
this
situation.
and
if
you
read
iowa
premium
carefully,
that
court
points
out
that
they
understood
that
before
1984,
the
current
expense
exception
was
the
law.
and
that
was
what
547(c)(2)
was
all
about.
we
next
turn...
i
have
5
minutes...
we
next
turn
to--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
wolas
it
was
an
en
banc
re-hearing,
your
honor.
it
was
5:
3
on
the
re-hearing.
and
i
commend
the
court
to
the
minority
decision.
i
think
it
is
absolutely
correct.
in
the
fidelity
case,
the
fidelity
case
is
one
clearly
dealing
with
547(c)(2).
and
in
fidelity,
the
court
made
the
finding
that...
the
court
discussed
the
commercial
paper
situation.
the
debtor
in
that
case
was
in
the
business
of
making
small
loans
to
a
lot
of
people
and
acquiring
its
money
by
issuing
certificates
to
many,
many
people...
not
too
dissimilar
from
the
lincoln
saving
situation.
the
fidelity
case
found
that
the...
yeah,
fidelity...
found
that
in
this
particular
situation,
it
was
a
normal
course
of
the
business
of
this
debtor
to
borrow
from
all
of
these
people,
and
repay
them
on
a
regular
basis,
and
reloan
to
all
these
people.
it
also
leaned
very
heavily
on
the
deconcini-dole
discussion,
and
likened
the
transactions
to
ordinary...
to
commercial
paper
transactions.
next,
in
the
in
re
finn
case,
that
was
the
retailer...
the
consumer
loan
transactions.
that
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
borrowing
was
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
financial
affairs
of
the
debtor.
i
respectfully
submit
that
when
547(c)(2)
was
amended
in
1984,
it
carried
with
it
90
years'
worth
of
baggage;
it
carries
with
it
substantial
historical
precedents...
both
legal
and
judicial.
and
that
if
congress
really
intended
to
emasculate
547(b)...
the
statute...
the
statutory
history
would
have
discussed
it.
unless
there
are
any
questions--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--they
could
have
done
a
lot
of
things.
but
they
didn't.
mr.
herbert
wolas
i
think
it's
an
unreasonable
interpretation,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
wolas
it
was
interesting
that
in
mid-atlantic,
you
took
language
that
was
absolutely
clear...
clear
language
from
the
statute...
the
trustee
may
abandon
property.
and
this
court
said
you
can't
look
at
just
the
language,
when
there
judicial
history,
legislative
history
behind
it.
and
that
was
judicially
created
restrictions
on
the
trustee's
ability
to
abandon--
mr.
herbert
wolas
--they're
substantial
judicial
history.
and
the
legislative
history
shows
what
was
being
dealt
with
on
a
very
limited
basis.
what
interest
was
being
protected,
and
what
interests
were
not
being
protected.
may
i
thank
you
for
letting
me
participate
in
this
exercise.
