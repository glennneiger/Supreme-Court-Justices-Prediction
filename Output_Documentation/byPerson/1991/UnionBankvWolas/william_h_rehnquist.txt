we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1491,
union
bank
v.
herbert
wolas.
mr.
graham.
spectators
are
admonished
to
not
talk
until
you
get
outside
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
chief

h.
rehnquist
that
was
the
year
in
which
the
45-day
provision
was
repealed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
graham.
mr.
wolas,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
1984,
you
mean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
though,
that
the
current
expense
exception
was
not
statutory
under
the
1898--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
unsecured,
commercial
paper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
need
legislative
history
to
tell
you
that
the
45-day
rule
is
gone.
that's
right
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
that's
because
other
creditors
are
not
as
fussy
as
banks
are.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
used
to
be.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
more
than
exercise,
mr.
wolas.
thank
you.
mr.
graham,
you
have
13
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
you've
got...
you
simply
have
an
unsecured...
you've
issued
an
unsecured
promissory
note
and
you
promise
to
pay
it
in
90
days.
and
the
bank
comes
to
you
at
the
end
of
30
days
and
says
look,
we're
not
really
happy
without
any
security.
give
us
some
security.
now
that
is
certainly
not
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
graham--
the
case
is
submitted.
