yes,
mr.
graham,
if
there...
should
we
look
at
the
fees
that
are
due
each
month
and
the
interest
payments?
now,
i
understand
this
is
a
line
of
credit
arrangement.
justice
clarence
thomas
is
there
any
distinction
between
the
fees
and
the
monthly
payments
of
interest,
and
the
actual
pay-down
of
the
principal?
justice
clarence
thomas
do
the
fees
and
the
interest
payments
become...
are
they
due
monthly,
or
are
they
long-term
debt
also?
