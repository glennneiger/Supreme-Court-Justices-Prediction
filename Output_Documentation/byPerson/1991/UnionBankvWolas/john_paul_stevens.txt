mr.
graham,
before
you
get
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
prior
statute,
sticking
for
the
moment
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
how
big
was
this
loan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
$7
million
loans,
borrowings,
made
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
for
the...
is
it
the
ordinary
course
of
business
for
the
bank
or
the
ordinary
course
of
business
of
the
borrower?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
my
question
is,
is
it
the
ordinary
course
of
this
borrower
to
make
$7
million
unsecured
loans?
isn't
that
the...
under
plain
language,
isn't
that
the
issue
for
us...
or
one
of
the
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
this
is
the
only
loan
of
this
magnitude
it
had
ever
made,
and
never
borrowed
more
than
$1,000
before,
what
would
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
with
respect
to
incurring
the
debt,
and
also
with
respect
to
the
payments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
this?
as
i
understood
your
opponent,
when
i
asked
him
similar
about
this
ordinary
course,
he
said
that's
a
question
of
fact
that
you
resolved
on
remand.
and
if
he
wins,
you
can
still
make
all
the
arguments
we're
making
now,
as
i
understand
his
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
your
bright...
what
would
your
bright-line
test
do
with
the
case?
say,
you
have
a
very
large
debtor
that
borrowed
$7
million
every
week.
they
were
constantly
borrowing
big,
revolving
loans,
just
a
huge
company.
so
it
was
really
a
very
routine
transaction
for
them,
and
they
were
repayable
in
7
or
8
months.
but
would
that
be
ordinary
course
or
not,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
so
frequent
they
didn't
need
corporate
resolutions.
they
had
a
general
authority
that
the
president
is
authorized
to
borrow
these
amounts
of
money
at
weekly
intervals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
even
your
rule
isn't
entirely
bright.
