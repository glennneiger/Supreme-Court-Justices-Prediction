let's
assume
a
small
business
that
incurs
a
substantial
loan
at
the
outset
of
the
business
to
purchase
the
real
estate
in
which
the
business
operates.
you'd
say
that
payments
made
off...
made
on
that
initial
loan,
which
is
far
and
away
greater
than
any
other
debt
the
business
incurred...
that
would
not
be
allowable
because
it's
not
in
the
ordinary
course?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
particular
business,
this
is
the
only
loan
of
that
magnitude
it
ever
took
out.
but
that's
standard
for
a
lot
of
small
businesses.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
just
the
particular
business,
you
say.
it's
businesses
in
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
quite
so.
and
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
for
a
business,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolas,
i
don't...
i
don't
see
where
you're
going...
or
i
think
i
do
see
where
you're
going...
so
these
were
the
three
groups
who
had
the
complaint.
but
congress
satisfied
those
complaints
by
adopting
a
particular
text.
and
the
text
simply
eliminates
the
distinction
between
long-term
and
short-term
debt.
it
takes
out
the
45
days,
and
doesn't
put
in
any
other...
any
other
language
that
contains
a
distinction
between
long
term
and
short
term.
which
satisfies
these
three
people.
these
three
groups
are
all
satisfied.
now,
it
also
happens
to
do
other
things.
but
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
very
often
congress
enacts
a
provision
that
solves
a
problem
and
then
goes
beyond
that.
the
way
they
chose
to
solve
the
problem,
your
brother
says,
is
a
way
that
happens...
that
happens
to
benefit
his
clients.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
read
it
that
way
because
it's
written
that
way.
it
isn't...
it
doesn't
say
paid
in
the
ordinary
course.
it
says
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course.
and
both
the...
both
the
debt
for
the
principal
and
the
debt
for
the
interest
are
incurred
the
say
way,
at
the
same
time.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
two
would
seem
to
go
together,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
are
not
loaning
as
much
money.
i
mean,
certainly
it's
a
lot
of
trouble
to
ask
a
corporation
to
go
through
that
for
a
small
loan.
it's
not
a
lot...
it's
not
unreasonable
to
ask
them
to
do
it
when
there
are
substantial
sums
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
did.
there
was
a
45-day
limit,
and
that
is
gone.
what
comes
in
to
replace
it?
what
is
your
theory
of
what
constitutes
ordinary
course
versus
not
ordinary
course?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
graham,
before
you
get
into
it,
would
you
tell
me
what
you
consider
not
in
the
ordinary
course?
now,
you
say
the
distinction
is
not
between
long
term
and
short
term,
which
is
what
the
court
below
held.
what
is
not
in
the
ordinary
course?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
talking
about
whether
it
was
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course,
not
whether
the
payment
was
made
in
the
ordinary
course,
right?
i
mean,
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
to
keep
our
eye
on
the
ball?
isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
difference
between
long-term
and
short-term
debt
is
a
difference
that
hinges
on
(a)
whether...
whether
the
debt
was
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
now,
the
example
you
gave
a
minute
ago
about
loaning
$8
million
to
general
motors
leads
me
to
believe
that
maybe
you're
backing
off
from
a
position
you
took
earlier...
i
must
say
i
rather
invited
you
to
take
the
position,
but
maybe
i
shouldn't
have...
and
that
was
you
now
seem
to
say
that
whether
it's
in
the
ordinary
course
depends
upon
whether
it's
ordinary
for
the
particular
business,
not
whether
it's
ordinary
for
all
businesses,
for
example,
to
make
one
enormous
borrowing
at
the
beginning
of
their
business
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
recall
that
exchange
we
had
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
to
decide
here
whether
this
loan
was
in
the
ordinary
course
or
not.
all
you
want
us
to
decide
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
a
long-term
debt
does
not
disqualify
it
from
this
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
both
wrong
or
are
you
both
right?
[laughter]
