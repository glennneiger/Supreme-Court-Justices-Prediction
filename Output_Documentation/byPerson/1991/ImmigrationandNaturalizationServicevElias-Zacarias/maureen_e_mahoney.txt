ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
respondent's
fear
that
he
would
be
kidnapped
by
guerrillas
to
serve
in
their
military
in
guatemala
rendered
him
a
refugee
eligible
for
asylum
in
the
united
states.
we
request
this
court
to
reverse
that
decision
and
to
uphold
the
board's
order
of
deportation
for
two
reasons
that
i'd
like
to
briefly
outline.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
apply
the
correct
legal
definition
of
the
term,
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion.
that
term...
the
precise
language
of
that
term...
has
been
a
part
of
the
united
states
immigration
laws
for
decades,
and
more
than
20
years
ago
it
was
interpreted
by
the
board
to
require
a
showing
that
the
persecutor's
motive
would
be
to
inflict
injury
for
the
specific
purpose
of
punishing
him
for
adherence
to
political
views
that
are
offensive,
to
single
him
out--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
yes,
the
argument
was
made.
the
board...
in
the
closing
argument
of
the...
in
the
proceeding
before
the
immigration
judge
the
counsel
for
the
service
specifically
said
that
the
respondent
had
failed
to
satisfy
his
burden
of
showing
that
he
had
been
singled
out
based
upon
his
political
opinions.
similarly,
in
the
court
of
appeals
there
was
a
reference
to
that
argument,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
wasn't
more
fully
briefed
simply
because
between
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
board
and
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
there
had
been
some
intervening
ninth
circuit
decisions
which
made
it
pretty
clear
that
they
had
rejected
the
definition
of
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion
that
the
board
had
historically
applied.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
no,
it
was
raised.
the
board
has
very
express
language
in
its
opinion
that
there
was
no
basis
to
infer.
in
fact,
they
say
that
it
could
hardly
be
inferred
that
the
guerrillas
approached
the
respondent
because
they
found
his
political
beliefs
to
be
offensive.
it
very
definitely...
and
it
referenced
two
other
decisions
of
the
board,
the
matter
of
vigil
and
also
matter
of
maldonado-cruz
which
had
been
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
thereafter,
which
relied
precisely
on
these
grounds...
the
definition
of
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion...
and
there--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
the
standard
of
proof
is
a
well-founded
fear,
and
yes,
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
a
guerrilla
could
in
fact
have
a
motive
that
did
not
constitute
an
intent
to
persecute,
but
if
the
objective
evidence
would
support
a
reasonable
inference
that
that
was
the
motive,
then
certainly
an
alien
could
prevail.
but
what
is
important
here
is
that
i
believe
that
the
issue
of
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
legal
definition
have
been
collapsed,
and
that
it's
important
to
establish
first
what
is
the
legal
definition
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
board's
decision
was
correct
under
that
definition,
since
the
board
and
not
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
has
to
draw
the
inference...
inferences
from
the
facts.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to...
to
really
articulate
precisely
what
the
standard
of
proof
is,
because
there's
really
no
reasonable
inference
on
this
record
that
the
purpose
of
the
guerrillas
in
seeking
out
the
respondent
was
to
punish
him
for
political
beliefs.
none
of
the
indicia
of
that
kind
of
conduct
are
present
on
this
record.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'd
like
to
clarify
what
this
record
shows
about
that
issue,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
found
that
the
respondent
had
a
well-founded
fear
that
he
would
be
kidnapped
and
forced
to
serve.
they
did
not
find
that
he
had
a
well-founded
fear
that
his
mere
refusal
for
having
served
would
result
in
his
ultimate
execution.
he
testified
at
the
hearing
that
he
had
a
fear
that
he
would
be
forced
to
serve,
and
he
also
suggested
he
had
a
fear
he
might
be
killed,
but
there
was
no
objective
evidence
of
that
whatsoever,
and
on
appeal
the
ninth
circuit,
i
believe,
found
that
he
had
a
well-founded
fear
that
he
might
be
kidnapped
because
there
was
some
objective
evidence
to
support
that.
the
state
department
had
submitted
a
report
that
indicated
that
forcible
recruitment
does
occur
in
guatemala,
but
that
same
report
that
the
ninth
circuit
accepts
in
part
found
that
that
practice
did
not
support
a
claim
that...
that
he
would
be
singled
out
on
the
basis
of
his
political
opinion.
in
other
words--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
that
it
would
be
sufficient.
it
would
then
be
necessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
purpose
that
the
guerrillas
would
have
for
killing
him
in
response
to
the
refusal
was
to
punish
him
for
his
political
beliefs,
or
whether
it
still
was
just
yet
another
measure
to
try
to
enlist
more
soldiers.
i
would
say,
though,
that
that...
the
question
of
that
inference
becomes
somewhat
different
than
the
one
that's
presented
on
this
record,
where
the
only
question
is
what...
is
it
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
purpose
of
kidnapping
him
for
refusal
to
serve
is
a...
an
intent
to
punish
him
for
his
political
beliefs,
or
is
it
simply
to
compel
compliance
with
the
request
that
they
made
for
him
to
join
their
military?
that's
the
situation
that
this
record,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
found
it,
presents.
i'd
like
to
turn
again
to
the
definition.
the...
there
is
a
suggestion
by
the
parties
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
motive
be
proven,
or
that
it
even
is
an
element
of
the
definition,
that
instead
it
is
simply
sufficient
if
the
respondent
had
a
political
opinion
that
caused
him
to
engage
in
the
activity
which
now
subjects
him
to
harm,
and
that
that
is
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion.
as
i
referenced,
that
has
never
been
the
definition...
the
articulated
definition
of
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion
throughout
the
history
of
our
immigration
laws
and,
in
particular,
this
court,
in
cardoza-fonseca
and
in
stevic,
found
that
a
controlling
principle
of
interpretation
of
the
refugee
definition
and
the
withholding
of
deportation
was
its
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
the
preexisting
practice
prior
to
1980
with
respect
to
the
terms
that
were
used
in
that
definition.
one
of
those
terms
was
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion,
and
in
1973
the
board,
in
a
case
called
matter
of
dunar,
specifically
used
this
articulation.
the
board
said
congress
sought
generally
to
shield
aliens
from
the
actions
of
their
own
home
governments
in
singling
them
out
for
punitive
treatment,
not
because
of
their
individual
misconduct
or
demerits,
but
solely
because
they
are
members
of
dissident
or
unpopular
minority
groups.
congress
sought
to
establish
a
preference
for
a
very
special
category
of
people,
not
just
anyone
who
might
be
subject
to
injury
in
war-torn
countries,
but
those
who
were
more
in
the
nature
of
martyrs,
those
who
had
either
political
beliefs
or
religious
beliefs
that
were
deeply
held
and
that
were
not
tolerated
by
the
societies
that
they
lived
in.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
the
definition
does
not
say,
but
again,
the
pre--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
position
is
that
the
preexisting
board
practice
that
we
presume
congress
relied
upon
when
it
used
these
terms
was
that
it
could
be
a
group
that
was
not
under
the
control
of
the
government,
in
other
words,
that
was
out
of
control,
that
the
government
couldn't
in
any
way
sort
of
keep
from
inflicting
severe
harms
on
its
population.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
be
a
mafia
group
in
sicily
if
the
government
is
simply
incapable
of
keeping
their
conduct
under
control.
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
showing,
and
usually,
your
honor,
i
think
it
comes
about
in
the
circumstances
where
there
is
some
suggestion
also
that
the
government
may
not
even
want
to
control--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
particular
group.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely,
your
honor,
or
religion,
or--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
mafia
does,
but
what...
what
i
would
reference
there
is
that
if,
for
instance,
they
single
out
a
different
nationality
for
adverse
treatment
that's...
that
sort
of
thing,
but...
but
yes,
your
honor,
it
absolutely
has
to
be
for
one
of
the
purposes
that
congress
prohibited.
there
are
only
five.
congress
did
not
say
that
persecution
that
is
inflicted
or
injury
that
is
inflicted
for
any
reason
other
than
these
five
makes
you
a
refugee.
in
fact,
it
said
only
these
five
purposes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no...
well,
your
honor,
the
immigration
judge
found
that
he
had
a
fear
that
he
would
be
harmed
if
he
went
against
the
current
government.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
difference
between
a--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
could
be,
your
honor,
if
what
he
said--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
was
not,
your
honor,
because
he
was
very
explicit
in
his
testimony
that
the
reason
he
did
not
want
to
go
against
the
government
was
not
because
he
believed
in
their
policies
or
thought
what
they
were
doing
was
right--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
that
he
didn't
want
to
suffer
harm.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
his
testimony
is
clear
that
he
did
not
express
sympathy
with
the
policies
of
his
own
government,
he
simply
expressed
fear.
he
said
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
killed
or
that
he
would
be
harmed
either
by
the
guerrillas
or
by
the
government,
and
that
is
not
a
political
opinion,
that
is
a--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--right.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
type
of
political
opinion
that
congress
was
referring
to.
the
whole
history
of
this
term,
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion,
was
directed
at
the
dissidents
of
totalitarian
regimes
who
were
silenced
through
physical
torture
and
imprisonment
because
they
dared
to
adhere
to
a
different
belief.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
political
dissidents?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
the
political
dissidents
generally
did
express
their
views,
and
that's
what
led
to
their
harm,
and
that's
why
congress
sought
to
protect
them.
even
if
we
could
say
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
a
political
opinion,
it
still
does
not
support
an
inference
that
that
caused
the
guerrillas
to
single
him
out
for
punishment.
the...
the
important
point
here
is,
what
is
the
purpose--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
i
would
make
that
argument,
because
the
inference...
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
record,
and
i
think
we'd
have
to
have
the
facts
of
record
regarding
the
way
in
which
this
was
done.
but
if,
for
instance,
your
honor,
they
killed
everyone
who
refused
to
join,
even
if
the
person
made
it
quite
clear
that
they
had
been
an
active
guerrilla...
excuse
me,
an
antiguerrilla
person
or
a
proguerrilla
person,
in
other
words,
with
regard
to
what
the
person's
political
viewpoints
were,
then
the
inference
would
still
be
that
they
may
well
be
simply
trying
to
enforce
a
system
of
deterrence
in
order
to
field
soldiers
and
not
to
specifically
try
to
suppress
that
belief,
and
that's
what
this
section
of
the
law--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well
that...
that
would
certainly
be
a
possible
outcome,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that,
given
the
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
and
other
cases,
though,
has
approached
the
question
of
forcible
recruitment,
it
is
possible...
a
possible
reading
of
the
opinion
that
even
if
it
understood
the
correct
standard,
that
it
would
still
nevertheless
apply
a
legal
presumption
that
the
guerrillas
are
motivated
to
punish
for
political
beliefs
simply
based
upon
their
forcible
recruitment,
but
it
certainly
would
be
a
possibility.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
certainly.
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
proper
disposition
of
the
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
there
would
certainly
be
circumstances
where
a
person
who
had
no
political
opinion
at
all
or
religious
belief
might
well
have
a
well-founded
fear
that
a
persecutor
would
impute
that
characteristic
or
belief
to
them.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
but
your
honor,
i'd
also
like
to
clarify
that
the
belief
in
the
mind
of
the
persecutor
is
not
some
extraordinary
standard
of
proof.
we're
talking
about
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
on
a
record.
in
other
words...
and
not
the
specific
persecutor,
but
rather
the
group.
in
other
words--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
he
has
to
have
a
well-founded
fear
about
the
persecutor's
state
of
mind.
in
other
words--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i'm...
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it's
not...
in
other
words,
the
persecutor
may
have
a
different
state
of
mind,
but
if
there
is
a
well-grounded,
a
reasonable
fear
that
the
persecutor's
state
of
mind
is
to
punish
for
political
opinion,
that
would
satisfy
the
act.
i
say
the
persecutor's
state
of
mind
is
being
controlling,
meaning
that
the
fear
about
the
persecutor's
state
of
mind
is
what
governs.
it's
not
the...
it's
not
the
applicant's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
but
it's...
it's
not
enough
that
he
simply
fears
that
what
he's
going
to
suffer
feels
like
persecution.
he
has
to
have
a
well-founded
fear
based
on
objective
facts
that
the
reason
this
injury
will
be
inflicted
is
because
of
the
persecutor's
motive
to
punish
him
for
a
proscribed
reason,
and
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--does
the
persecutor
have
to
have
that
reason?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
the
victim
wouldn't
have
to
if
there
was
substantial...
if
there
was
a...
a
reason
to
believe
that
the
persecutor
would
impute
that
characteristic
or
opinion,
and
his
certainly
has
happened
in
the
past
and
can
happen
in
the
future.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
it
could,
if...
to
the
extent
that
there
are
people
who
the
persecutor
might
perceive
to
be
within
that
group,
they
would
be
protected,
but
i
think
in
the
ordinary
case
the
objective
facts
would
usually
just
give
rise
to
a
well-founded
fear
where
the
person
is,
in
fact,
within
that
group.
in
fact,
even
the
handbook
that
the
u.n.
high
commissioner
has
done
indicates
that
ordinarily,
to
establish
a
claim
for
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion,
you'd
have
to
show
that
you
have
that
political
opinion
and
that
political
opinion
has
become...
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities,
because
usually
it's
not
going
to
be
a
well-founded
fear
that
you're
going
to
be
persecuted
for
a
political
opinion
that
you
do
not
have.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
it
is
an
issue
of
evidence
to
be
resolved
by
the
board.
the
board
is
the...
is
the
finder
of
fact
in
this
case,
and
as
long
as
it
applies
the
correct
standards
and
the
inferences
it
draws
are
not
unreasonable
and
not
unsupported
by
the
record,
those
inferences
are
binding,
and
they
were
binding
in
this
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
no,
your
honor.
no.
it
is
not
critical
that
he
express
his
belief,
as
long
as
there
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
believe
he
was
18.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
he
is
no
john
dockerty,
and
the
government
has
never
said
otherwise.
the
question
here
is
simply,
what
is
the
class
of
refugees
eligible
for
the
grant
of
asylum?
there
was...
it's
very
important
that
that
class
not
be
expanded
far
beyond
the
bounds
that
congress
intended
for--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
even
if
we
did,
your
honor,
mr....
the
respondent
in
this
case
in
fact
has
never
testified
that
he
believed
that
he
was--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
there
has
to
be
objective
facts
to
support
the
well-founded
character
of
his
fear
that
the
reason
for
the
persecution
would
be
based
upon
his
political
beliefs,
and
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
he
has...
he
has
to
have
a
fear
that
when
he
returns,
correct--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that...
that
he
would
be
subjected
to
the
injury
that
he
claims.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
punishment?
in
other
words,
that
the...
the
reason
that
they
were
imposing
the
punishment--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
the
term,
political
enemies
may
be--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
if--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--if
the
evidence...
if
the
board
concluded
that
the
evidence
supported
a
well-founded
fear
that
that
was
the
reason,
then
yes,
the
statute
would
apply.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because
on
this
record
there's
no
indication
that
that
punishment
was
being
inflicted
differentially
on
people
depending
upon
what
their
political
viewpoint--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--if
there--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--if
there
was
objective
evidence
of
that,
in
other
words
if
the
state
department
reported
that
guerrillas
say
that
that's
the
reason
that
they
do
this--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
that's
just
simply
not
a
reasonable
inference
that
that
is...
that
that's
the
purpose
of
imposing
the
punishment.
i
mean,
this
court,
in
a
series
of
cases,
has
confronted
the
question
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
punishing
people
for
refusal
to
in...
to
join
the
army,
and
in
the
gillette
case
in
particular,
the
issue
was,
was
there
a
purpose
to
punish
him
for
his
religious
views
because
he
wasn't
allowed
an
exemption,
and
this
court
said
no.
the
only
reasonable
inference...
the
only
reasonable
inference
is
he's
being
punished
because
he
refused
to
join,
and
the
purpose
is
to
field
an
army,
and
that
is
the
same
purpose
the
guerrillas
had
in
this
case.
it
is
simply
not
reasonable
to
infer
that,
when
all
they're
doing
is
going
and
kidnapping
them
to
force
their
compliance
with
their
request
that
what
they're
really
doing
is
trying
to
suppress
and
wipe
out
a
political
viewpoint
that
is
hostile
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that...
that
it
would
be
just
like
that.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
the
objective
evidence
of
record,
but
it
is...
but
it
would
be
a
factor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i...
i'm
trying
to
clarify
that
if
they
just
say,
he
who's
not
with
us
is
against
us,
i
don't
think
that's
the
same
as
saying
we're
going
to
punish
you
for
your
political
beliefs.
but
if
there
is...
if
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
board
could
say...
supported
the
conclusion
that
the
purpose
was
not
to
field
the
army...
for
instance,
if
there
was...
if
it
could
be
shown
that
only
those
people
with
hostile
views
to
the
guerrillas
were
forcibly
recruited,
whereas
those
with
progovernment
guerrillas...
proguerrilla
views
were
left
in
their
homes
if
they
voluntarily
refused,
that
may
well
support
an
inference
that
what
they're
doing
is
singling
out
political
enemies
for
adverse
treatment,
but
there's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
plus
one
more
step,
your
honor.
even
if
they
believe
that
he
has
a
view
that
is
hostile
to
them,
that
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
convert
their
purpose
from
being
one
of
recruitment
to
being
one--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--of
punishing
him
for
that
view.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
fundamental
step
that
sort
of
defies
common
sense
on
this
record.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
standard
of
proof
that
the
board
has
used
is
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
person
would
fear
that
the
persecution
is
being
inflicted
for
this
reason.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
is
a
liberal
standard--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
it
is
a
liberal
standard,
and
the
board
has
found
it
met
on
many
occasions,
but
not
in
this
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
there
is,
but
the...
as
soon
as
the
eligibility
is
expanded
to
persons
who
make
no
greater
showing
than
the
respondent
in
this
case,
there
then
are...
there's
the
potential
of
millions
of
additional
applicants
for
asylum
flooding
into
the
country
and,
in
addition,
making
it
more
difficult
for
refugees
from
outside
the
country
to
obtain
admission
into
the
country.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
they...
they
said...
the
language
that
they
used
in
this
case
is
that
this
record
could
hardly
support
a
view,
and
i
believe
that
under
any
standard
of
proof,
even
one
that
is...
that
is
more
liberal
than
the
one
the
board
uses
would
not
support
an
inference.
it's
just
not
a
rational
inference
on
this
record,
because
it
is
not
what
the
alien
subjectively
fears,
it's
what
a
reasonable
person
would
fear
based
upon
the
objective
record,
and
that
does
not
support
it.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
could.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'd
like
to
stress
that
the
statute
uses
motive,
not
legality,
to
distinguish
between
refugee
status.
it
is
the
motive
of
the
government
or
the
uncontrolled
group
in
inflicting
the
punishment
that
controls,
and
if
this
court
finds
that
the
refusal
to
serve
manifests
a
political
opinion,
then
there's
no
basis
to
distinguish
draft
resisters.
they,
too,
would
have
manifested
a
political
opinion.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but,
your
honor,
it's
the
motive,
and
if
the
motive
is
to
punish
them
for
the
refusal--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it...
persecution
also
has
motive
within
it,
your
honor.
persecution
has
long
been
defined
to
include
an
intent--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
for
instance,
a
government
might
well
have
a
law
on
its
books
that
says
that
anyone
who
is
found
practicing
the
christian
faith
shall
be
thrown
into
jail.
that
would
be
lawful,
but
it
would
nevertheless
be
persecution
within
the
meaning
of
this
act.
it
is
the
intentional
infliction
of
injury
for
the
purpose
of
making
him
suffer.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
if
we
have
a
nondiscriminatory
law,
your
honor...
the
point
here
is
that
if
the
refusal
to
serve
is
itself
the
expression
of
a
political
opinion,
then
throwing
someone
into
jail
for
that
would
be
punishment
for
political
opinion.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
why
is
it...
our
position
is,
why
is
it--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
then--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
question
then
is
why
is
not...
why
is
it
persecution
for
the
guerrillas
to
do
it,
if
the
motive
is
the
same?
the
guerrillas'
motive
is
to
field
an
army,
just
as
is
the
government's.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you.
