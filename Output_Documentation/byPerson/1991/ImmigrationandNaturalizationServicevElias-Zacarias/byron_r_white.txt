justice
byron
r.
white
--it
still
has
to
be
on
account
of
political
beliefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i'm
not
sure
how
much
the
mafia
is
interested
in
political
beliefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the...
didn't
the
immigration
judge
here
find
that...
that
this
person
refused
to
join
the
revolutionaries
because
he
didn't
want
to
go
against
the
current
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that...
if
he
didn't
want
to
disagree
with
the
current
government,
isn't
that
a
brand
of
political
belief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wasn't
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
he
still
was
against...
he
was
in
a
sense
saying,
i'm
with
the
government,
and
i
would
think
the
revolutionaries
who
were
against
the
government
might
think
that's
a
bad
attitude
to
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
fear
has
to
be
at
the
time
that
he
wants
asylum,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
his
attitude
was
when
he
refused
conscription.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he...
but
he...
but
his
well-founded
fear
has
to
be
of
prosecution
on
account
of
his
political
beliefs?
justice
byron
r.
white
which--
justice
byron
r.
white
--which
may
be...
which
in
fact
may
be
baseless?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
but
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
i...
in
the...
but
it
may
be
that
he...
the
fact
is
that...
it
may
be
that
the
fact
is
that
he
would
never
be
prosecuted
for
anything,
let
alone
his
political
beliefs.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
here
the
bia
said
that
any
fear
the
respondent
has...
that
he...
that
he
may
have
of
being
harmed
by
them,
the
guerrillas,
is
only
speculative,
particularly
where
no
evidence
has
been
submitted
to
show
that
the
guerrillas
harm
those
who
refuse
their
evidence...
their
invitation
to
join
them,
and
that
this
harm
would
amount
to
persecution
rather
than
retribution.
now,
they
didn't
apply
any
presumption.
they
just
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was...
that
there
was
just
a
failure
of
proof.
now,
what...
what
basis
did
the...
or
what
standard
should
the
ninth
circuit
apply
in
reviewing
that...
that...
that
finding
that
there
was
a
lack
of
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
say...
they
say
the
board
was
just
plain
wrong
in
saying
there
wasn't
any
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
exactly
right...
exactly
right,
let
alone
any...
unless
there's
some
well-founded
fear
of...
of
persecution
of
any
kind,
he
won't
get
to
first
base--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
that's
exactly
what
this
finding
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
ninth
circuit
just
disagreed
with
the
finding
i
just
read...
read
to
you?
they
say
there
is...
the
bia
was
just
wrong
in
assessing
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
found,
contrary
to
the
bia,
that
there
was
a
well-founded
fear
of...
of
being
harmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the...
suppose
everyone
agreed
that
there
was
a
well-founded
fear
that
if
he
returned
to
guatemala
he
would
face
forced
recruitment
by
one
side
or
the
other
and
forced
recruitment
would
mean
kidnapping
him
and
carrying
him
off
and
giving
him
a
gun?
now
if
that's
all
that
was
proved,
you...
you
wouldn't
have
made
out
a
case
under
the
statute,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
can't
you
just
say
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he...
he
still
has
to
prove
some
connection
with...
with
political
belief,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
fears...
if
he
fears
recruitment
by
either
side,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
think
that
it's
because
of
his
political
beliefs.
