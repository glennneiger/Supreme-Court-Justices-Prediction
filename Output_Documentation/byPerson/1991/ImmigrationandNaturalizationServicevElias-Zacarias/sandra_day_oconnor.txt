ms.
mahoney,
isn't
it
possible
under
this
statute,
that
the
applicant
can
demonstrate
that
he
had
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution,
even
though
the
actual
motive
of
the
persecutor
may
be
something
he
can't
prove?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
clarify
something
for
me?
the
statute
doesn't
speak
directly
to
it,
but
is
there
any
limitation
on
who
the
persecutor
must
be?
does
it
have
to
be
an
act
of
the
sovereign
or
can
a
nongovernmental
group
meet
the
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it
be
a
mafia
group
in
sicily?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
pretty
liberal
standard,
is
it
not,
in
favor
of
the
alien?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
interpret
the
statute
liberally
in
favor
of
the
alien
applicants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
also,
i
suppose
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
want
to
grant
asylum
in
a
particular
case,
there
is
still
discretion
to
deny
it.
