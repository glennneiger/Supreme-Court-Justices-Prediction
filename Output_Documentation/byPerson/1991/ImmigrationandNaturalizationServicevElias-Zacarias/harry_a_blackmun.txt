you're
arguing
this
almost
by
implication,
aren't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that...
oh,
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
require
that
he
express
his
belief
in
favor
of
the
government
in
power
to
these
guerrillas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
old
was
this
man?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he's
no
john
dockerty,
is
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
think
it's
important,
however,
that
we
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
a
17-year-old
confronted
by
two
guerrillas
with,
what,
machine
guns?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
has
to
be
your
position.
