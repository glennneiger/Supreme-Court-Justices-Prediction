justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
argument
made
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
they
applied
the
wrong
standard,
why
shouldn't
we
send
the
case
back
to
have
them
apply
the
right
standard?
why
should
we
try
to
decide
it
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
say
they...
they
would
apply...
couldn't
we
tell
them
not
to
apply
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
and
how
is
it
the
belief
in
the
mind
of
the
persecutor
that's
determinative?
the
statute
says,
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
on
these
bases.
surely
it's
his
state
of
mind
that
counts.
now,
his
state
of
mind
has
to
be
well-founded,
but
it
could
be
well-founded
but
erroneous,
so
that
in
fact
the
state
of
mind
of
the
persecutor
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
actual
state
of
the
persecutor's
mind
is
not
determinative.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
suggest
that's
a
confusing
way
to
put
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
his
state
of
mind
that's
controlling,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
victim--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
it
takes
to
change
our
whole
immigration
law
is
for
the
leader
of
the
guerrillas
to
say,
he
who
is
not
with
us
is
against
us,
and
if
he
says
that,
automatically,
these
are...
they're
all
being
persecuted
for
their
religious
views?
is
that
what
the
law
is,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
a
record.
somebody
comes
in
and
testifies,
the
leader
of
the
guerrilla
said,
he
who
is
not
with
us
is
against
us,
and
automatically
all
of
these
people
who
refused
to
be
impressed
into
service
suddenly
have
political
asylum.
that's
the
position
the
government's
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
about...
is
there
any
requirement
that
he
actually
have
a
political
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
doesn't
say
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
on
account
of
supposed
political
opinion,
but
it
says,
on
account
of
political
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
he
have
to
have
a
political
opinion?
he...
he
does
not,
your
honor,
and
i
take
the...
i
take
the
position
of
the
government
to
be
essentially
in
agreement
with
that,
although
they--
--i'm
not
sure.
i
thought
ms.
mahoney
said
that
the
board
has...
has
required
that
there
be
an
actual
political
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she
seemingly
said
that
with...
with
approval.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
the...
the
political
opinion
on
the
record
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
a
political
opinion,
to
say
i
do
not
want
to
have
political
opinion?
is
that
a
political
opinion?
you
say,
i
do
not
want
to
have
a
political
opinion.
he
didn't
say
he
wanted
to
be
for
the
government,
either.
he
didn't
want
to
be
for
the
guerrillas,
or
against
the
guerrillas.
he
did
not
want
to
be
against
the
government.
how
does
one
not
have
a
political
opinion
if
that's
a
political
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there...
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
that
they
cared,
so
long
as
he
picked
up
a
machine
gun
and
shot
it
at...
at
the
people
these
guerrillas
were
fighting,
that
they
cared
what
his
political
views
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you
draw
no
distinction
between
his
agreement
to
fight
alongside
them
and
his
agreeing
with
their
political
views.
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
that
they
cared
at
all
what
his
views
about
marxism,
about
capitalism,
about
whatever
these
guerrillas
are
fighting
about
might
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
need
there
not
be,
unless
you
say,
you
know,
being
afraid
of...
of
dying
and
being
afraid
of
engaging
in
machine
gun
battles
is
a
political
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
the
in...
i
mean,
the
only
inference
i
see
is
that
they
wanted
people
to
fight
alongside
them,
and...
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
they
cared
whether
this
fellow
even
understood
the
political
ramifications
or
what
they
were
fighting
for
politically.
they
just
wanted
somebody
to
shoot
bullets.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what...
what
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
robertson,
you
described
a
little
earlier
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
as
saying
that
there
was
simply
no
basis
for
the
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
of...
of
persecution
on
the
basis
of
political
belief.
that's
how
you
described
it,
and
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
up
to
the
board
to
find
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
persecution,
it...
it's
that
asylum
is
denied
unless
there
is
evidence
of
persecution.
in
other
words,
it's
up
to
the
applicant
to
show
evidence
of
persecution,
and...
and
it
seems
to
me...
i
mean,
you
may
call
it
a
presumption
if
you
like,
but
i
would
call
it
a
burden
of
proof.
it's
up
to
the
applicant
to
show
that
there
was
a
well-grounded
fear
of
persecution
on
the
basis
of
his
political
belief.
it's
not
up
to
the
board
to
establish
evidence
to
the
contrary.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise,
he
has
not
made
his
case.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
that
goes
to
the
point
that
we've
been
discussing
here.
i
think
it's
conceded
that
they
were
going
to
hurt
him
for
not
joining.
he's
going
to
be
hurt.
i
don't
think
the
government's
arguing
that,
that
he...
that
he
had,
or
did
not
have
a
well-grounded
fear
of
being
hurt...
kidnapped,
killed,
injured,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
all
that
question
went
to,
not
whether
there
was
a
political
motivation
behind
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
because
he
would
not
join
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
he's
against
them.
i
mean,
he
is
not
with
them,
he's
against
them.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
elias-zacarias,
is
a
native
of
guatemala.
he
was
apprehended
in
july
of
1987
for
entering
the
united
states
illegally.
in
his
deportation
proceedings
he
testified
that
the
previous
january,
two
armed
uniformed
guerillas
had
appeared
at
his
family's
home
in
guatemala
and
had
asked
him
and
his
parents
to
join
forces
with
him.
when
he
and
his
parents
refused,
the
guerillas
asked
them
why,
told
them
that
they
would
be
back
and
advised
them
to
think
it
over.
elias-zacarias
testified
that
he
did
not
want
to
join
the
guerillas
because
he
was
afraid
the
government
would
retaliate
against
him
and
his
family
if
he
did.
he
said
that
the
reason
he
left
guatemala
two
months
later
was
that
he
was
afraid
that
the
guerillas
would
return.
elias-zacarias
offered
evidence
that
the
guerillas
in
fact
twice
returned
in
continued
efforts
to
recruit
him.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
determined
that
elias-zacarias
was
ineligible
for
asylum
which
is
available
at
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
anyone
who
has,
in
the
words
of
section
101(a)(42)
of
the
immigration
act,
"a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
on
account
of
race,
religion,
nationality,
membership
in
a
particular
social
group,
or
political
opinion".
in
reversing
the
bia's
determination,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
a
guerilla
organization's
acts
of
conscription
constitute
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion,
and
that
elias-zacarias
therefore
had
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion.
in
order
to
reverse
the
bia,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
find
that
on
the
facts
presented,
eligibility
for
asylum
is
not
only
a
possible
or
even
a
probable
finding
but
that
it
is
the
only
reasonable
one.
the
question
before
us,
therefore,
is
whether
a
guerilla
organization's
attempt
to
coerce
a
person
into
performing
military
service
necessarily
constitutes
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion
within
the
meaning
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
we
hold
that
it
does
not.
even
a
person
who
supports
the
political
aims
of
a
guerilla
movement
might
resist
military
combat
because
of
unwillingness
to
put
his
life
at
risk
for
example,
and
thus,
become
the
object
of
such
coercion.
moreover,
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion
is
not
established
by
the
fact
that
the
coercer,
the
guerillas,
had
political
motives
in
order
to
satisfy
section
101(a)(42)
the
persecution
must
on
account
of
the
victim's
political
opinion,
not
the
persecutor's
political
opinion.
since
elias-zacarias
did
not
produce
evidence
so
compelling
that
no
reasonable
fact
finder
could
fail
to
find
the
requisite
fear
of
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
proper
basis
to
set
aside
the
bia's
determination.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
blackmun
and
o'connor
have
joined.
