justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a...
supposing
a
voter
says
the
reason
i'm
voting
for
candidate
x
is
because
i'm
afraid
of
the
harm
of
losing
my
job?
would
that
be
a
political
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
reason
for
my
vote,
and
that
people
are
voting
that
particular
way.
they
want
to
avoid
that
particular
harm.
they
don't...
they
don't
understand
the
economic
theory--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
various
political
dialogues
that
go
on,
but
that's
the
single
thing
that
motivates
their
choice.
how
would
that
be
different
from
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
they
just
wanted
to
avoid
the
harm
that
was
associated
with
that
kind
of
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
carry
it
one
step
further.
you...
you
make
the
same
argument
even
if
they
intended
to
kill
him
for
not
joining
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
i
correctly
understand
that
if
the
objective
evidence
would
support
the
inference
that
the
guerrillas
treated
people
who
refused
to
enlist
or
join
voluntarily
as
political
enemies,
that
then
the
statute
would
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
they
would
regard
those
who
refused
to
join
up
upon
request
as
political
enemies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
having
an
unacceptable
political
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
statute
would
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would...
would
objective
evidence
of
a
series
of
punishments
being
inflicted
upon
people
who
refused
to
join
up
justify
that
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i've
said
i've
defined
the
political...
the
political
opinion
being
that
you
don't
agree
with
it,
that
the
fact
that
you
will
not
join
up
is
sufficient
evidence
of
having
an
unsatisfactory
political
opinion
to
the
guerrillas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
mere
fact
you
didn't
join--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
don't
have
to
say
it,
they
act
in
a
particular
way
in
respect
to
people
who
act
by
not
joining
up.
isn't
that
objective
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
this
point...
the
question's
kind
of
troublesome
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
the
record,
both
sides
were
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
forced
recruiting,
the
government
forces
as
well
as
the
guerrillas,
and
if
you
had
a
man
precisely
positioned
as
this
one,
only
he
had
refused
to
join
the
official
army
and
received
the
same
threats,
had
the
same
fear,
and
so
forth,
would
he
be
coming
within
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just...
the
record's
exactly
like
this
record,
but
it's
just...
you
change
the
side.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
government
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
instead
of
being
shot,
they
were
merely
going
to
imprison
him
for
draft
evasion
for
30
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
turns,
i
gather,
on
what
the
word
persecution
means.
if
it's
officially
authorized,
it's
not
persecution
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
if
it's
unofficially
guerrilla
warfare,
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
might
not
be
persecuted,
if
you
just
enforce...
enforce
a
generally
applicable
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
motive
goes
to
the
on
account
of
part,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
word
persecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if...
what
if
one
of
the
elements
of
persecution
is
acting
in
conflict
with
established
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
have
to
have...
i'm
assuming
a
nondiscriminatory
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
wouldn't
be
persecution
on
account
of
political
opinion,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
punishment,
i
agree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
statute
doesn't
use
the
word
punishment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
i
say,
there's
an
ingredient
of,
in
accordance
with
a
nondiscriminatory
law,
and
they
are
not
acting
in
accordance
with
a
nondiscriminatory
law.
