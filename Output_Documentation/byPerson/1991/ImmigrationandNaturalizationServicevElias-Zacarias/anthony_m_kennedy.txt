is
it
just
the
initial...
is
it
just
the
initial
approach
of
the
guerrillas
that's
controlling?
i
had
thought
that
the
respondent's
position
was
that
he
would
be
in
jeopardy
because
of
his
having
rejected
their
initial
approach
and
what
they
might
do
to
him
in
the
future--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the...
his
situation.
it
may
change
quite
drastically
once
he's
turned
them
down.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
he
had
a
well-founded
fear
that
he
would
be
killed,
i
take
it
that
would
be
sufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--now,
all
he
has
to
show
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
how
do
you
square
the
board's
almost
blanket
presumption
that
these
guerrilla
groups
did
not
have
that
purpose
with
the
reasonable
possibility?
if
the
alien
fears
there's
a
reasonable
possibility...
and
fonseca
even
has
a
numerical
calculation
of
this
which
is
very
deferential
to
the
alien...
it
seems
to
me
the
case
still
has
to
go
back
for
them
to
assess
that
reasonable
possibility.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
do
you
have
any
quarrel
with
the
legal
standards
that
the
solicitor
general
has
set
forth
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
ms....
ms.
mahoney's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
requisites,
i
take
it,
is
satisfactory
with
you?
it's
just
a
matter
of
how
we
apply
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
but
it's
a
matter
of
application
in
this
case
that
we're...
that
we're
concerned
with,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
will
agree
with
ms.
mahoney's
statements
of
the
legal
requisites
to
show
political...
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
by
reason
of
political
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
deal
with
inferences
and
probabilities
and
likelihoods.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
is
the
basis
for
that
empirical
assessment?
maybe
they
sought
out
this
19-year-old
because
they
thought
he
was
very
reliable.
he
was...
tended
to
be,
maybe,
antigovernment.
that's
why
they
wanted
him.
he
said,
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
with
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
have
to
show
this
on
the
record.
you're
asking
us
to
make
an
empirical
assumption
that
any
time
someone
doesn't
join
a
guerrilla
movement
and
is
punished,
that
the
guerrillas
will
do
so
because
they
assume
he
has
a
political
opinion,
but
i
just
don't
see
the
empirical
basis
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
was
the
ninth
circuit's
empirical
basis,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
the
board
doesn't
make
the
inference
and
the
ninth
circuit
does,
and
i...
i
take
it
we're
as
well-positioned
as
the
ninth
circuit
to
disagree
with
that.
