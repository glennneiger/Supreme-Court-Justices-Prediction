justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
mahoney
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
you.
you're
saying
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter,
that
the,
in
this
case
that
the
guerrillas
have
acted,
that
you
believe
that
he
takes
the
position
he
did
as
a
result
of
his
political
opinion,
and
number
two,
he's
got
to
prove
that
that
was
his
political
opinion...
in
other
words,
that
they
were
correct
about
that.
am
i
right,
he's
got
two
positions?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
belief
in
the
mind
of
the
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
victim
does
not
have
to
have
that
reason
in
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
--does
not
have
to
have
that
reason
in
fact,
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
even
though
the
object
of
the
statute,
as
you
said
a
moment
ago,
was
to
protect
those
who
take
conscientious
political
positions,
in
fact
on
your
theory
the
statute
will...
can
protect
a
great
many
other
people,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
mahoney--
--that's
an
issue
of
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this.
does
this
assume
that
the
facts
are
the
guerrillas.
he
says
no.
the
guerrillas
then
make
it
plain
by
whatever
means
that
they're
going
to
kill
him,
kidnap
him,
persecute
him
in
some
way.
has
he
made
a
case
under
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
in
other
words,
what
he's
got
to
show
is
not
merely
that
the
guerrillas
are
angry
because
he
would
not
join
up.
he's
got
to
show,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
based
on
further
evidence
than
i
have
indicated
in
my
hypo,
that
the
guerrillas
infer
that
the
reason
he
didn't
join
up
is
that
he
holds
a
substantive
political
position
which
is
inimical
to
them.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying
that
he's
got
to
prove?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
right.
in
other
words--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
got
to
be
the
purpose
for
their...--
justice
david
h.
souter
is
this...--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
don't
know...
so
far
as
the
record
indicates,
he
came
to
that
conclusion
because
he
thought
the
government
was
going
to
hurt
him
and
he
didn't
want
to
get
hurt,
but
doesn't
the
statute
in
referring
to
political
opinion
refer
to
some
kind
of
a
substantive
opinion
about
the
merits
of
a
position,
and
if
that
is
so,
then
what
he
has
indicated
here
is
a
political
judgment
that
he's
made,
but
not
the
espousal
of
a
substantive
political
opinion.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
are
you
saying
that...
are
you...
are
you
implying
that...
that
for
the...
for
the
guerrillas
to
take
the
position
that
he
who
is
not
for
us
is
against
us
is...
is
a
sufficient
inference
about
political
opinion.
they
don't
have
to
know
why
he's
not
for
us,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
the
government
has
to
claim
that
he
has
to
be
not
for
them.
if
he's
not
for
them...
if
they
can
simply
say,
if
you
are
not
with
us,
you
are
against
us,
that
is
an
espousal
of...
or
that
is
a
basis
for
inferring
a
political
opinion
that
you
espouse,
that's
all
that's
got
to
be
proved.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is...--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
well
that's...
i
mean
that's...
that's...
that's
a
good
point
of
evidence,
but
isn't
it
the
case,
then,
it
is
not
the
broader
concept
of
political
opinion
as
you
suggest,
that
anyone
who
disagrees
with
an
organization
capable
of
persecution
and
who
is
then
persecuted
will
always
automatically
qualify
as
being
persecuted
or
having
fear
of
persecution
because
of
political
opinion?
there
really
is
no...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
we
adopt
a
definition
as
broad
as
you
are
urging
on
us,
the
condition
really
doesn't
mean
anything.
all
you've
got
to
have
is
disagreement,
and
if
all
you've
got
to
have
is
disagreement,
why
is
that
condition
about
political
opinion
in
there
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
you
always
have
a
nexus
in
your
theory.
all
you've
got
to
have
is
a
disagreement
in
effect
for
whatever
reason,
followed
by
some
basis
to
fear
persecution,
and
the
condition
for
political
opinion
has
been
satisfied.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
always
going
to
be
with
a
political
faction,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that
simply
means
that
they
have...
that
they
do
have
the
means
to
persecute,
but
i
mean,
all
of
these
disagreements
are
going
to
be
with
somebody
who
holds
some
political
view,
and
who
must
have
some
means
of
persecuting
or
he
wouldn't
have
any
case
to
fear
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
mafia
is
not
a
political
organization?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you're
assuming
it,
i
think.
