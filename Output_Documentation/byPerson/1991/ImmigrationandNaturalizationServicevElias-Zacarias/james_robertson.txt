mr.
james
robertson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
5
years
ago,
in
the
cardoza-fonseca
case,
the
immigration
service
argued
to
this
court
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
about
the
well-founded
fear
standard
except
in
terms
of
more
likely
than
not
or
more
probable
than
not.
the
court
didn't
find
it
impossible.
the
court
held
that
the
bia
had
got
it
wrong
in
requiring
asylum
applicants
to
prove
a
clear
probability
of
persecution
and
found
that,
indeed,
the
reasonable...
the
well-founded
fear
standard
could
be
met
by
something
less
than
50
percent
and
perhaps
even
as
little
as
10
percent.
mr.
james
robertson
to
the
extent
that
the...
the
solicitor
general
requires
there
to
be
something
more
than
the
inference
that
this
reasonable...
that
this
young
man
had
about
his
fear,
yes,
we
do
quarrel
about
it,
but
in
theory...
in
theory
the,
well--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
she...
she
says
that
the
standard
is
applied
the
same
way.
the
problem
is
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
not
been
applying
them
the
same
way.
they
have,
in
fact,
been
using
presumptions
in
place
of
evaluations.
mr.
james
robertson
it...
it
is
a
matter--
mr.
james
robertson
--not,
your
honor,
if
that
standard
requires
both
a
specific
showing
of
the
political
opinion
of
the
applicant
and
a
specific
showing
that
the...
that
the
purpose,
the
specific
purpose
of
the
persecution
which
is
feared,
and
which,
after
all,
hasn't
happened
yet,
will
be
specifically
to
punish
the
applicant
for
that
political
opinion.
that
standard...
that
standard
is,
in
our
submission,
impossible
as
a
practical
matter
to
meet
in
the
real-life
cases--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
your
honor,
we
do
deal
with
these
inferences,
and
if...
and
if
the
standard
is
expressed
in
terms
of
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn,
yes,
we
have
no
problem
with
the...
with
the...
with
the
basic...
with
the
basic
standard.
mr.
james
robertson
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
a
well-founded
fear,
reasonable
standard--
mr.
james
robertson
--runs
all
the
way
through
this--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
if
it
is
baseless,
your
honor...
if
it
is
baseless,
then...
then
it
is
not
well-founded.
i
mean,
we're--
mr.
james
robertson
--the
well-founded
issue--
mr.
james
robertson
--it...
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor.
that
is
why
the
well-founded
fear
standard--
mr.
james
robertson
--requires
only
that
he
reasonably
believe
it
and
that
the
possibilities,
indeed,
may
be
considerably
less
than
50
percent.
in
the
cardoza-fonseca
case
the
court
laid
out
a
set
of
facts
that
left
very
little
doubt
that
a
reasonable
person
might
have
a
well-founded
fear
if
the
chances
are
only
1
in
10.
mr.
james
robertson
your
honor,
no.
mr.
james
robertson
it--
mr.
james
robertson
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
james
robertson
--there
is...
there
is
in
the
cases...
this
case
does
not
present
these
facts,
because
there
is
a
political
opinion
on
the
record
of
this
case,
but
there
are
cases--
mr.
james
robertson
--the
political
opinion
on
the
record
is
established
by
the...
by
the
alien's
testimony
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
against
the
government.
that's
what
he
said
at
his
immigration
hearing.
that...
that
testimony
was
believed
by
the
immigration
judge--
mr.
james
robertson
--and
specifically
found
credible.
mr.
james
robertson
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
have
trouble
with
how
one
does
not
have
a--
mr.
james
robertson
--a
political
opinion--
mr.
james
robertson
--but
in
this
particular
case,
the
statement,
i
don't
want
to
be
against
the
government,
is
clearly
a...
a
political
opinion.
mr.
james
robertson
your
honor,
the
government
attempts
to
look
at
this
as
a
judgment
on
his
part
that
it's
not
a
good
idea
for
him
to
be
on
the
guerrillas'...
but
from
his
point
of
view...
and
remember
the
statute
requires
to
look
at
it
from
his
point
of
view...
from
his
point
of
view,
it's
a
political
opinion.
he's
a
19-year-old
kid.
it
is
as
much
of
a
political
opinion
as
we
require
any
of
our
citizens
to
have
when
they
walk
in
to
the
polling
place
and
pull
the
levers.
mr.
james
robertson
all
that
has...
yes.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if...
if
i
follow
the
question
correctly,
that
is...
he
is
for
us...
he
who
is
not
for
us
is
against
us
would
be
more
than
enough.
mr.
james
robertson
that...
well
the...
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
political
opinion
in
this
case
is
manifested...
is
manifested
by
the
applicant's
refusal
to
join
the
guerrillas.
now,
the
threat
that's
on
the
record...
and
we
should
not
forget
this
threat,
from
which
a
number
of
inferences
come...
the
threat
that
was
made
was
made
after
the
refusal
to
join,
i'm
not
going
to
join
you,
we're
leaving,
we're
coming
back,
think
it
over
well.
mr.
james
robertson
well,
your
honor,
because
we
have
to
have
the
nexus
between
the
disagreement
and--
mr.
james
robertson
--your
honor,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that
it
is
quite
that
broad.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
i
need
to
come
back
to,
we
don't
have
just
a
disagreement
and
a
fear
of
persecution.
we
have
a
disagreement,
we
have
a
disagreement
with
a
political
faction,
we
have
a
disagreement
with
a
political
faction
who--
mr.
james
robertson
--yes,
but
this
political
faction
was
carrying
machine
guns
and
was
masked.
mr.
james
robertson
well,
if
i
may...
if
i
may
refer
to
the
hypothetical
that
was
put
about
the
mafia,
if
an
applicant
has
a
political
opinion
about
anything,
and
is
persecuted
by
the
mafia,
it
may
very
well
be
that
on
that
hypothetical
there
is
no
nexus
at
all
between
the
persecution
and
the
political
opinion.
mr.
james
robertson
we
will
assume
that,
if
we
may,
here.
i...
i
will...
try
to
assume--
mr.
james
robertson
--i
will
assume
it
for
purposes
of
that
hypothetical
discussion.
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
guerrillas
who
are
a
political
faction,
who
are
impressing,
dragooning
people
for...
for
their
purposes,
political...
and
by
the
way,
justice
souter,
the
purposes
for
which
the
dragooning
and
impressing
may
be
more
than
just
political.
they
may
be
more
than
just
overbearing
the
will
of
the
alien.
they
may,
indeed,
be
for
many
purposes,
including
the
government's
argument
that
they
are
trying
to
fill
up
their
ranks.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
threat
of
punishment
of
the
alien
is
on
account
of...
is
because
of...
after
and
because
of
his
refusal
to
join
them,
then
the
19-year-old
alien
looking
at
the
situation...
the
machine
guns,
the
masks,
the
threat...
may
reasonably
conclude
that
he's
been
threatened,
that
he's
been
threatened
because
of
his
political
views,
and
that
if
he
returns,
he
may
very
well
be
not
only
conscripted
but
murdered
because
of--
mr.
james
robertson
--that
they
cared--
mr.
james
robertson
--your
honor,
i
think
i
have
to
answer
that
question
no,
as
it's...
as
it's
asked.
there...
there
need
not,
indeed,
be
any...
anything
specific
in
the
record.
indeed,
in
the
case
of
canas,
the
bia--
mr.
james
robertson
--that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor,
that
being
afraid
of
dying
and
engaging
in
machine
gun
battles
is
the
political
view.
we
rest
at
this
point,
because
of
the...
the
record,
indeed,
was...
was
cut
off
at
the...
at
the
immigration
status
in
a
way
i'll
explain
in
a
moment,
but
as
the
record
now
stands,
we
rest,
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
on
the
inference
that
may
be
drawn
from
all
of
the
facts;
the
political
faction,
the
threats,
the
refusal,
and
fleeing
the
country,
and...
and
what
he
now
fears,
and
on
the
state
department
letter,
which--
mr.
james
robertson
--i...
i
suspect,
justice
scalia,
that
in
no
case
will
the
guerrillas
actually
enter
into
the
intellectual
exercise
of
deciding
what
is
in
the
mind
of...
of
the
person
they
are
trying
to
dragoon,
but
if
he
demonstrates
resistance
to
them,
they,
one
may
reasonably
infer,
will
conclude
that
he
is
against
them,
and
once
concluding
that
he
is
against
them,
they
will
deal
with
him.
it
is
that
fear
of
what
they
will
do
when
they
deal
with
him
which
is
the
persecution--
mr.
james
robertson
--inferentially
on
account--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
that
is
not...
of
course,
we
don't
see
the
inflections
that
happened
at
the...
at
the--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
i'm
actually
asking
the
court
to
affirm
what
the
ninth
circuit
found,
which
was
on
a
substantial--
mr.
james
robertson
--on
a
substantial
evidence
basis
that
there
was
no
evidence
for
the
finding
that
there
was
nothing.
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
substantial
evidence
finding
on
the
meaning
of
the
state
department
letter,
and
what
the
state
department
letter
says,
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that...
that
the
state
department
letter
established,
contrary
to
the
conclusion
of
the
bia,
that
the
state
department
letter
did
establish
the
existence
in
guatemala
of
armed
conflict
and
forced
conscription.
now
from
that,
it
is
inferential...
it
is
inferential
from
all...
from
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
i've
already
laid
out
and
i
won't
repeat
at
great
length
about
the
masks
and
the
machine
guns.
mr.
james
robertson
well,
your
honor,
what
the
board...
the
reason
the
board,
in...
in
our
submission,
the
reason
the
board
does
not
make
this
inference
is
that
the
board
has
decided,
in
a
series
of
cases
beginning
with
maldonado,
right
after
cardoza-fonseca,
the
board
has
made
a
series
of
judgments
about
what
it
is
guerrillas
do
and
why
they
do
it.
and
in
the
maldonado
case,
maldonado
case...
maldonado-cruz
case,
which
was
the
first
of
these
post-cardoza-fonseca
cases,
what
the
board
said
was,
it
may
be...
it
may
be
that
the
guerrillas
have
reasons
other
than
political
ones,
and
holding
at
page
517
of
the
maldonado-cruz
bia
opinion,
there
is
an
implicit
presumption
of
a
legitimate
basis
for
punishment.
now,
the
erection
of
presumptions
in
that
manner
by
the
bia
defeats
the
well-founded
fear
standard
that
was
articulated
in...
in
cardoza-fonseca.
in
effect,
it
says,
you
may
be
afraid
of
something.
we'll
concede
that
you
have
a
well-founded
fear
of
something,
but
you
must
now
find
by
clear
probability
of
some
kind,
or
you
must
overcome
our
presumption
in
order
for
us
to
find
that
it's
on
account
of
political
opinion.
mr.
james
robertson
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
applies,
and
i
believe
all
the
circuit
courts
apply,
the
substantial
evidence
test
to
factual
findings
of
the
bia.
mr.
james
robertson
yes,
well,
that
particular
part
of
the
opinion
that
you're
reading
from,
justice
white,
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
fear
of
anything
at
all,
and
indeed
is
why
the
case
went
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
james
robertson
i...
yes,
that's
clearly
the
case.
mr.
james
robertson
that's
clearly
the
case,
and
that's
the
way
the
case
went
to
the
ninth
circuit,
without
any
of
this
question
about
political
opinions,
by
the
way.
mr.
james
robertson
you
can
read
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i
submit,
in
our
submission,
that
the...
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
really
done
is
to
demonstrate
its
inference
here.
mr.
james
robertson
well,
that's...
that's
clear,
your
honor,
but
the...
but
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in...
in
this
case
discusses
the
threat,
discusses
the
country
conditions,
discusses
the
country
conditions,
discusses
the
political
opinion
of
the
applicant,
elias
zacarias,
and
then
determines
that
the
threat
was
not
demonstrated
to
be
for
personal
reasons,
was
not
demonstrated
to
be
for
any
other
reason,
the
ins
came
forward
with
nothing--
mr.
james
robertson
--the
ninth
circuit
found
that
there
was
indeed
a
threat
of...
of
a
reasonable
fear
of
persecution.
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
persecution
he
reasonably
feared
was
kidnapping,
and
did
not
reach,
really,
the
question
that
we
think
is
also
presented
by
this
fact...
by
these
facts,
that
he
reasonably
feared
kidnapping,
assassination,
murder,
because
that's
what
he
said
that
he
feared.
now,
justice
white,
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
has,
indeed,
conceded
at
this
stage
that
there
is
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution.
the...
the
government
says
that
issue
is
not
before
us.
there's
nothing
left
here,
now,
but
the
question
of
whether
the...
the
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
is
on
account
of
political
opinion.
mr.
james
robertson
i...
i
take
the
government's
statement
of...
the
first
part
of
its
brief
as
to
what
is
left
for
this
court
to
decide
to
be
such
a
concession,
yes,
i
do.
mr.
james
robertson
it
is.
the
applicant
does,
indeed,
have
the
burden
of
establishing
his
entitlement
to
the
status.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
if
there
were
any
evidence
on
the
other
side,
it
might
be
in
equipoise,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
equipoise.
the
government
presented
no
evidence.
indeed,
the
government
cut
off
the
attempt
of
elias
zacarias'
counsel
to
explain
more
about
what
it
was
that...
that
he
feared.
at
page
6(a)
of
the
opposition
to
certification
in
the
records,
there
is
this
question
and
answer:
"do
you
have
any
idea
what
would
have
happened
to
you
if
you
would
have
returned
and...
if
they
would
have
returned
and
found
you
again?
"
"objection,
your
honor,
speculative.
"
by
government
counsel.
"sustained",
and
there
was...
there
was
no
opportunity
for--
mr.
james
robertson
--well
then...
then,
your
honor--
mr.
james
robertson
--then...
then
the
question
is,
if
the
court
takes
that
much
as
conceded,
as
indeed
do
we,
then
the
only
question
is,
for
what
reason
would
he
be
hurt,
and
then,
in
our
submission,
the
statute
compels
looking
at
the
question
through
the
eyes
of
the
applicant,
who
is
the
one
after
all
who
has
the
fear,
and
is
his
subjective
fear
well-founded?
he
knows
he's
got
a
politically
motivated
guerrilla
band
in
front
of
him.
he
knows
they're
going
to
hurt
him.
he
knows
he
has
told
them
he's
not
going
to
join
them.
why
would
they
hurt
him?
now,
the
bia
says--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
but,
because
he
would
not
join
them...
because
he
would
not
join
them
demonstrates
to
them
that
he's
not
for
them,
therefore
he's
against
them.
mr.
james
robertson
there
is
a
good
deal
of
bia
decisionmaking
on
that
subject,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there's
a
clear
distinction
there
between
whether
it
is
the
government
or
not.
it
could
be
persecution,
if
the
government...
if
the
government
wanted
him--
mr.
james
robertson
--if
the
record
is
exactly
like
this
record,
if
what
he
fears
is
being
taken
out
and
shot,
yes,
it
would
be
persecution.
mr.
james
robertson
even
if
it
were
the
government.
mr.
james
robertson
if
there
were
proportionality
and
due
process
by
a
legitimately
constituted
government
it
would
not
be
persecution.
that
is--
mr.
james
robertson
--well,
he
is...
from
his
point
of
view,
the
result
might
be
the
same.
from
his
point
of
view
the
result
might
be
the
same,
but
the
cases
and
the
established
bia
jurisprudence,
which
we
do
not
contest
here,
does
draw
the
distinction.
indeed,
if...
if
i
may
mention
before
my--
mr.
james
robertson
--if
it's
officially
authorized,
if
it's
prosecution,
and
if
it's
prosecution
that
doesn't
violate
international
standards
in
some
way,
then
it
may...
then
it...
then
it
may
not
qualify
as
persecution
within
the
act.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
salim
case.
the
salim
case
is
a
case
in
which
an
afghani,
a
refugee,
was...
was
granted
asylum...
actually,
he
wasn't
granted
asylum,
but
his
refugee
status
was
recognized
as
far
back
as
1982
on
no
ground
except
that
he
feared
conscription
in
the
afghani
army,
which
was
not
controlled
by
afghanistan
but
by
the
soviet
union.
that
was
the
entire...
the
only
basis
for
the
salim
recognition,
and
the
salim
case
has
vitality
today,
despite
what
the
government
says
about
its
being
a
dead
letter.
it
is
still
being
cited
by
the
bia,
and
it
still
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
dragooning
and
conscripting
people
by
legitimate
governments
and
by
rebel
bands
like
the
guerrillas.
it
is
the
salim
case
and
the...
and
the
inconsistency
established
by
the...
by
the
salim
case,
particularly
by
the
salim
case,
that
underlines
the
point
in
our
brief
that
this
is
certainly
not
a
case
in
which
the
decisions
of
the
bia
are
entitled
to
any
deference
under
the...
under
the
chevron
standard.
mr.
james
robertson
your
honor,
our
position--
mr.
james
robertson
--i'll
answer
that
question
no,
we
would
not,
if
only
forced
conscription
were
involved.
mr.
james
robertson
he
has
to
prove,
but...
he
has
to
prove
some
connection,
some
nexus
between
a
political
belief
and
the
persecution
that
he
fears,
yes.
in
our
view
that
nexus
is
clearly
established
by
his
political
act
of
refusal.
mr.
james
robertson
that
would
be
neutrality,
your
honor,
and
the
bolanos-hernandez
case
and
others
deal
with
the
neutrality
question,
and
whether
that
is
a
political
opinion.
is
it?
in
our
view,
neutrality
is
a
political
opinion,
but
it's
not...
but
it's
not
an
issue
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
james
robertson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
