we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-727,
robert
g.
holmes
v.
the
securities
investor
protection
corporation.
mr.
samet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
agreed
that
sipc
is
simply
here
standing
in
the
shoes
of
investors
who
themselves
could
not
have
met
the
birnbaum
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
didn't
grant
certiorari
to
review
sipc's
separate
standing.
we
thought
we
were
taking
a
case
that
simply
involved
a
question
of,
for
instance,
posed
in
section
2
of
the
questions
presented,
whether
a
person
has
standing
under
rico
when
they
wouldn't
have
if
they
were
just
going
under
a
straight
securities
act
claim.
why
do
we
need
to
get
into
all
of
these
ramifications
of
what
sipc
did
or
didn't
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
as
presented
so
far,
your
argument
doesn't
depend
on
our
opinion
in
blue
chip
stamps.
it's
an
interpretation
of
the
rico
section
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
rico
to
be
construed
broadly?
is
that
something
this
court
has
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
says
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
samet.
mr.
blakey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
blakey,
you're
speaking
as
if
it
were
a
trial
below.
but
as
i
understand
it...
and
you
talk
about
facts
that
were
found
below.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
other
issues
actually
tried?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
they
were
raised;
i
asked
you
whether
they
were
tried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay.
then
answer
the
question
briefly,
if
you
will.
they
were
not
tried.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
the...
reversed
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
there
were
no
factual
findings
made
in
the
sense
you're
talking
about.
both
courts
were
dealing
with
motions
for
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
found
that
in
a
summary
judgment
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
had
raised
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
blakey.
mr.
samet,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
samet.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
three
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
