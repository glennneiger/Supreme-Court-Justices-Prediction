justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
not
assume
for
purpose
of
your
argument
that
such
a
fraud
actually
occurred,
that
there
was
a
predicate
act.
you
just
challenge
the
causal
connection
between
it
and
your
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore...
and
also
a
predicate
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
standing
doesn't
affect
whether
the
act
occurred,
does
it?
because...
it
affects
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
there's
no
standing
here,
no
causal
connection
and
all,
but
if
the
violation
of
10b
occurred,
and
that's
a
predicate
act
within
the
statute,
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
concede
there
was
a
predicate
act,
but
merely
argue
that
it
didn't
have
the
necessary
causal
connection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
blue
chip
holds
that
in
10b-5,
that
there's
no
10b-5
violation
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
for...
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
the
category
of
customers
who
purchased
or
sold
the
manipulated
securities,
and
who
had
their
own
class
action
and
recovered
some
of
their
own
money,
did
that
recovery
not
reduce
the
obligation
of
sipc
to
pay
to
them
their
losses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
got
a
double
recovery,
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
i
think
it's
related
to
what
we've
granted
certiorari.
supposing
there
had
been
no
lawsuit
by
the
customers
of
these
firms
that
had
purchased
and
sold
securities,
that
they
lost
their
money
when
the
brokerage
firm
went
bankrupt.
and
the
amount
paid
by
sipc
to
them
was
precisely
the
amount
that
they
lost
in
making
purchases
and
sales
of
the
manipulated
securities.
would
you
say,
then,
that
there
was
no
standing
on
the
part
of
sipc
to
reimburse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
doesn't
our
answer
in
this
case
depend
on
the
extent
to
which
there
is
subrogation
of
claims
of
purchasers
or...
the
extent
to
which
sipc
reimbursed
persons
who
had
valid
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
samet--
--may
i
interrupt
there?
you've
put
in
an
awful
lot
of
events.
supposing
that
all
that
was
involved
is
that
the
brokerage
firm
itself
had
taken
a
large
position
in
manipulated
securities
and
there...
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
caused
it
to
fail.
and
as
a
result
of
the
failure,
sipc
had
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
to
its
customers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
not
sure
what
your
answer
is.
if
the
record
showed
that
the
only
reason
the
firm
failed
was
because
it
made
purchases
of
the
manipulated
securities,
and
that's
the
only
reason
sipc
paid
any
money
to
the
firm,
would
there
be
sufficient
direct
causation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
think
you're
general
approach
to
it
might
decide
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
said,
as
i
understand
you,
that
unless
sipc
itself
were
a
purchaser
or
seller
of
securities,
it
has
no
rico
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though...
even
though
but
for
the
illegal
conduct,
the
sipc
would
not
have
had
to
pay
any
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
whether
the
record
shows
the
extent
to
which
sipc...
when
it
makes
payments
like
they
made
here,
some,
i
don't
know,
$
12,
000,
000
or
whatever
it
was...
to
what
extent
are
they
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
the
person
to
whom
they
made
the
payment?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
take
the
position
they're
not
subrogated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
help
you
to
take
the
position
they
were
subrogated
in
order
to
avoid
your
client's
risk
of
double
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
you
point
out
there
are
three
categories
of
claims:
those
by
the
individuals
and
sellers
who
are
suing
on
their
own,
and
you're
not
subrogated
as
to
them;
the
intermediate
non-purchaser
or
seller-customer
claims;
and
third,
the
firm
claims
themselves,
where
you
are
subrogated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
my
question
is
this.
supposing
that
the
combination
of
recoveries
in
the
first
and
third
categories
exceeds
or
equals
the
amount
of
damage
done
by
the
defendants.
are
you
still
entitled
to
recover
something
additional
for
the
second
category
of
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
so
they
would
not
be...
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
then
there's
a
category
of
nonpurchaser-seller
customers
whom
you
did
reimburse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
assume
that
the
wrongdoers
have
paid
the
firm
everything
it
tortiously
took
from
this
firm,
and
the
other
customers,
everything
that
they
lost.
are
you
still
entitled
to
recover
for
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
not
the
category
that
you've
had
to
reimburse,
because
they
were
presumably
hurt
by
other...
you
know,
this
is
not
the
sole
cause
of
the
failure
of
this
firm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
you
describe
it,
let's
be
sure
i
understand,
as
you
describe
it,
i
would
think
my
second
category
would
also
have
a
cause
of
action
against
these
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they
are
not
purchasers
or
sellers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
blakey?
this
intermediate
group
of
customers
who
did
not
themselves
buy
or
sell,
under
your
view
of
rico
i
take
it
they
would
have
been
able
to
sue
under
rico?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
blue
chip
case,
you
know,
cuts
against
you
in
a
way
because
that
opinion
assumed
there
were
classes
of
investors
other
than
purchasers
or
sellers
who
could
be
directly
injured.
but
they
nevertheless
followed
the
old
birnbaum
rule
and
limited
standing
to
purchasers
and
sellers.
so
the
premise
of
that
decision
was
that
there
are
a
category
of
people
directly
harmed
by
the
wrongdoing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
he
said
in
the
opinion.
he
discusses
the
three
classes
of
harmed
persons
and
said
they
don't
have
standing--
