mr.
g.
robert
blakey
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court.
must
every
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act,
when
the
predicate
offenses
are
securities
fraud,
mail
fraud,
and
wire
fraud,
be
a
purchaser
and
seller...
or
seller
to
have
a
claim
for
relief?
mr.
holmes
says
yes.
securities
investor
protection
corporation
says
no.
sipc's
arguments
may
be
summarized
in
three
words
and
three
short
paragraphs:
text,
text,
text.
rico
expressly
incorporates
by
reference
the
express
criminal
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934.
it
does
not
incorporate
the
'34
act's
judicially
implied
civil
claim
for
relief.
as
such,
the
purchaser-seller
limitations
on
the
implied
private
enforcement
mechanism
of
the
1934
act,
recognized
by
this
court
in
1975
in
blue
chip,
are
simply
not
relevant
under
rico's
expressed
private
enforcement
act.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
there
is
indeed.
the
phrase
"injured
in
his
business
or
property.
"
has
been
understood...
and
properly,
i
think...
in
the
context
of
corporations
to
exclude
shareholders,
in
the
context
of
unions
to
exclude
members,
in
the
context
of
counties
to
exclude
taxpayers.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
if
the
relationship
between
a
broker
and
his
customers,
which
is
the
relationship
we
deal
here,
has
as
its
best
common
law
analogue,
bailor-bailee,
and
the
classic
position
has
been
between
bailor-bailee,
that
either
has
the
ability
to
sue
for
injury
to
the
property.
i
would
suggest
to
you,
justice
o'connor,
however,
that
this
relationship
is
not
the
common
law
relationship
of
bailor-bailee,
but
the
peculiarly
statutory
relationship
of
a
customer
and
a
broker-dealer.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
it
is
suing
in
several
capacities
for
several
claims.
it
is
not
suing
for,
at
this
time,
as
a
subrogee
of
any
of
the
customers
that
had
a
purchaser-seller
10b-5
claim.
that's
a
separate
claim
and
a
separate
cause
of
action.
and
this
record
indicates
that
sipc
was
unable
to
show
that
any
of
the
customers
on
behalf...
it's
speaking--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--we
still
won
the
case,
justice
white,
because
we
are
suing
as
a
subrogee
of
customers
who
were
not
purchaser-sellers.
and
under
the
peculiar
provisions
of
sipa,
we
are
a
real
party
in
entrance
in
all
matters
growing
out
of
liquidations,
and
thus,
we
have
a...
are
entitled
to
be
heard
for
all
claims
that
can
be
asserted
by
the
trustee.
and
we
are,
in
addition,
subrogated
to
the
trustees'
claims
insofar
as
we
have
paid
him
or
advanced
him
money.
so
we
are
here,
not
in
our
own
right.
we
do
not
stand
in
our
own
shoes;
we
stand
in
the
shoes
of
customers
who
are
not
purchaser-seller,
who
were
nonetheless
injured.
and
we
stand
in
parallel
shoes,
statutorily,
with
the
trustee
itself.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
your
honor,
what's
happened
between--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--no.
the
only
issue
faced--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--i
am...
yes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
justice
white,
i'm...
an
interesting
thing
happened
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
the
argument
that
was
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
basically
an
interpretation
of
the
phrase
"any
person".
and
we
took
the
not
unusual
position
that
"any
person"
didn't
mean
any
purchaser
and
seller.
and
what's
happened
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
is
my
good
friend
has
moved
off
to
the
right
a
little
bit
and
is
trying
to
get
the
purchaser-seller
limitations
in
through
the
back
door.
having
failed
to
get
it
in
through
any
person,
he's
attempting
to
insert
it
in
through
"injury
to
business
or
property"
or
"by
reason
of".
and
we
raised
in
the
brief
that
this
is
perhaps
not
within
the
petition
for
cert.
nevertheless,
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
discuss
that
with
the
court
since
you
surely
have
discretion
to
hear
anything
that
you
want.
to
the
degree
that
he's
challenged
my
"in
my
business
or
property"
standing,
to
degrees
that
he
has
challenged
my
"injury
by
reason
of",
i
have
felt
duty
bound
to
answer
those
arguments.
i
need
not
answer
them
to
support
the
court
of
appeals.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
is
equally
supported
in
its
own
terms
in
arguments
that
i
have
made
here
today.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
i
have
to
kind
of
go
back
through
and
figure
it
out.
the
way
it
works
out,
there's
no
double
recovery.
if
the
parties
themselves...
if
the
purchaser-seller
customers
recover--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--100
cents
on
a
dollar,
and
we
did
not
reimburse
any
of
them,
that
takes
care--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--that's
not
taking
any...
take
care
of--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--that's
correct.
we
now
stand
in
their
shoes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
if
everybody
has
been
paid
off
everything--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
really
appropriate
to
talk
about
how
this
firm
went
under.
this
firm
did
not
go
under
simply
by
a
fraud
in
the
purchase
and
sale
of
security.
the
underlying
challenge
here
is
to
have
schemed
to
defraud.
and
in
the
scheme
to
defraud,
we
had
factually
a
situation
where...
and
maybe
i
should
explain
the
record
here.
mr.
holmes'
co-conspirator,
mr.
lugo,
took
stock
out
of
proprietary
account
in
first
state,
and
moved
it
into
mr.
holmes'
account.
and
the
reason
he
did
that
is
he
would
avoid
his
liquidity
crisis
that
would
come
from
the
discount
for
the
stock
in
the
proprietary
account.
he
did
that
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only,
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
had
a
net
capital
deficiency.
because
he
was
able
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
had
a
net
capital
deficiency,
he
was
able
to
stay
in
business
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
and
not
only
did
he
go
under,
and
had
he
not
done
it,
he
would
have
gone
under
for
about
$
700,
000...
he...
not
only
he
went
under,
but
he
took
in
sebag
in
california.
he
hid
that,
not
from
purchaser-sellers.
he
hid
that
from
the
regulatory
system.
and
we
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
regulatory
system.
the
scheme
to
defraud
that
did
in
these
two
broker-dealers
is
a
scheme
that
transcends
fraud
on
individual
purchaser
and
sellers
who
were
customers.
it's
a
fraud
against
the
broker-dealer
and
it's
a
fraud
against
the
regulatory
system
as
well.
let
me
give
it
to
you
as
a
practical
example.
suppose
a
terrorist
group
wanted
to
engage
in
fundraising
activities
and
they
decided
to
work
a
life
insurance
scam
involving
some
of
its
own
members.
and
they
blow
up
an
airplane
to
collect
the
life
insurance
on
those
two
member
passengers.
clearly
the
insurance
company,
if
it
pays
off,
will
be
subrogated
to
the
estates
in
their
claims.
the
issue
here,
though,
is
whether
there
is
an
injury
in
the
business
or
property
and
a
proximate
cause
relationship
to
the
injury
also
done
to
the
other
passengers
and
to
the
airlines.
and
that's
precisely
what
we
have
here.
this
is
not
a
fraud
directed
to
just
some
purchasers.
it
was
a
fraud
that
in
its
scheme
took
in
the
broker-dealers
and
all
of
the
customers
who
were
there.
accordingly,
we
suggest
that
there
is
a...
sipc
is
a
proper
party
plaintiff
to
bring
it
because
it
stands
in--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--oh,
i
think
they
do.
i
think
the
other
customers
have
a
category
and
a
claim.
interestingly
enough,
if
we've
paid
them
off--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--that's
correct.
well,
they
may
have
it
under
the
security
statutes,
too.
what
we
would
suggest
to
you
is,
and
now
i'm
not
really
arguing
securities.
i'm
arguing
injury
to
business
or
property,
and
i'm
arguing
injury
by
reason
of,
which
has
nothing
to
do,
as
he's
presented
it,
with
the
fact
that
it's
underlying
security.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
but
let
me
give
you
a
slightly
different
example
from
the
common
law.
it
is
standard
hornbook
law
that
if
i
defrauded
a
testator
into
leaving
to
me
property,
and
justice
white
would
have
been
the
person
to
whom
the
request
goes,
he
has
a
claim
for
relief
against
me,
even
though
he's
not
the
immediate
target
because
he's
within
the
intended
sphere.
let
me
rive
you
another
example...
is
if
a
group
of
corporations
undertake
a
pattern
of
fraud
to
cheat
the
government,
clearly
the
government
can
sue,
but
what
about
the
next
honest
bidder
who
would
have
obtained
the
bid
but
for?
i
think
that
next
honest
bidder
has
a
claim
for
relief.
and
on
this
issue,
which
is
the
proximate
cause
question,
there
was
a
summary
judgment
below.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
the
environmental
tectonics
v.--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--no.
environmental
tectonics
v.
kirpatrick,
which
is
both
an
antitrust
case
and
a
securities...
i
mean
and
a
rico
case...
847
f.
2d
1052
1007,
in
the
third
circuit,
affirmed
on
other
grounds
by
this
court.
my
reference
to
the
defrauded
testator
is
supported
by
bohannon
v.
wachovia
bank
and
trust
company,
210
north
carolina
679.
my
illustration
of
the
terrorist
in
the
airplane,
slightly
modified,
is
reflected
in
judge
posner's
rico
decision
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
matter
of
e.d.c.--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--your
honor,
no,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
mother,
the
brother,
the
uncle,
of
any
of
the
purchasers,
or
the
landlord
of
one
of
the
customers
who
now,
because
the
customer
was
defrauded,
can't
continue
to
maintain
his
rent.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
no.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
the
injury
there
is
precisely
to
injury...
to...
this
is
the
corporate
analogy.
the
injury
is
to
sebag.
sebag
has
the
claim
for
relief.
the
customer...
the
customers
were
not
injured
in
their
business
and
property
within
the
meaning
of
rico,
injured
in
their
business
or
property.
but
we
sue
here
for
the
injury
to
the
customers.
the
causal
relationship
between
their
illegal
conduct
and
the
injury
to
the
customers
is
the
same,
whether
it
is
a
purchaser-seller
customer,
or
whether
it
is
a
nonpurchaser-seller
customer.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
yes.
this
is
a
question
of
proximate
causation,
and
it's
a
question
as
to
which
we
raised
in
the
court
below,
a
material
question
of
fact,
as
so
found
by
judge
toshima.
it
is
a
question
that
the
defendant
below
defended
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
proximate
relationship
between
his
personal
conduct
and
the
fraud
and
the
collapse.
that
was
accepted
by
judge
toshima,
and
it
was
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
equally
responsible
with
his
xx
conspirators'
conduct.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
clearly
under
rico,
and
a
minimum,
the
predicate
offense
is
mail
fraud
or
wire
fraud.
and
we
think
they
could
just
as
easily
sue
using
a
fraud...
the
securities
act
because
this
does
not
incorporate
10b-5.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
it's
the
loss
that
they
suffered.
as
soon...
what
happened
here--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
your
honor,
part
of
the
problem
here
is
that
scheme
to
defraud
is
not
equivalent
to
common
law
deceit.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
for
example,
in
carpenter,
it
extends
to
misappropriation.
this
court
has
not
limited
scheme
to
defraud
to
the
common
law
meaning.
it
included
chicanery
and
overreaching.
and
the
chicanery
and
overreaching
in
this
situation
caused
this
broker-dealer
to
go
under.
when
that
broker-dealer
went
under,
it
took
out
the
business
and
it
took
out
the
property
that
the
broker-dealer
had
in
its
hands.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
but
in
this
context,
the
defrauding
was
of
the
broker-dealership
itself.
for
example,
if
you
sink
a
boat,
it
sinks
all
passengers.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
that's
what
common
law
deceit
meant.
mail
fraud
says
scheme
to
defraud
and
scheme
to
defraud
has
never
been
limited
to
common-law
deceit.
if
congress
had
meant
common-law
deceit
in
1972
when
it
enacted
the
mail
fraud
statute,
it
would
have
said
deceit.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
the
issue
here
is...
can
be
put
in
terms
of
what
is
the
target
of
the
fraud.
if
you
focus
the
target
only
to
obtain
the
property
from
the
meaning
person,
you
answer
is
obviously
correct.
but
all...
but
the
problem
with
target
in
that
context,
it's
a
nubber-band
word.
you
can
narrow
it
that
way
or
you
can
extend
it
to
ask
what
were
the
means
by
which
the
property
was
done
in?
and
if
the
means
included
destroying
someone
else's
property,
as
you
got
there,
that
person
is
part
of
the
intended
scope
of
the
fraud.
and
he
equally
ought
to
have
a
claim
for
relief
as
the
person
who
is
the
primary
target.
you
can
be
an
intended
target
and
not
be
the
primary
target.
that's
the
airplane
example.
my
intended
target
was
my
two
people
and
the
insurance
company,
but
i
took
out
the
whole
airplane.
my
intended
target
was
cheating
the
people
who
were
buying
and
selling
the
stock,
but
my
impact
of
it
was
to
take
out
the
entire
broker-dealership.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
justice
scalia,
this
is
a
fact-specific
question
that
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
the
held...
the
holding
below
is
that
we
raised
a
material
question
of
fact
on
that
question.
and
i
think
that
it
is
in
one
sense
not
in
the
grant
of
cert,
but
if
it
is
in
the
grant
of
cert,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
facts
as
argued
and
found
below,
the
facts
as--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
bunnington
park.
when
property
was
taken
out
of
one
account
and
put
into
another,
to
keep
the
broker-dealership
alive,
that
is
part
of
the
scheme
to
defraud.
and
it
was
only
because
it
was
kept
alive
for
a
period
of
time
that
when
it
did
collapse
it
took
out
not
only
the
property
of
the
immediate
target
of
the
fraud.
it
took
out
all
the
other
customers'
property
as
well.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
it
granted
summary
judgment
only
on
the
issue
is
we
were
not
a
purchaser-seller.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
all
the
other
issues
were
raised.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
they
were
posed
in
a
motion
for--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--no,
they
were
not
tried.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
correct.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
perhaps
i
misspoke.
what
i
should--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--and
i
withdraw
what
i
said,
and
would
like
to
rephrase
it.
for
the
purposes
of
the
summary
judgment,
the
lower
court
found
that
we
had
raised
a
material
question
of
fact
on
each
of
these
other
issues,
that
there
was
an
enterprise
that
we
were
employed
and
associated
by,
that
there
was
a
pattern,
and
that
there
was
a
nexus,
a
proximate
cause
nexus
between
the
wrongdoer's
conduct
and
the
injuries
sustained.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
it
found
that
we
had
raised--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--a
material
question
of
fact
as
to
it.
and
therefore,
we
were
entitled
to
a
trial
on
that
question.
and
what
we...
but
having
found
that,
it
then
dismissed
it
on
the
grounds
that
we
lack
purchaser-seller
standing.
the
difficultly
with
purchaser-seller
standing
is
that
it
is
a
concept
that
can
be
used
in
several
different
senses.
it
can
be
used
in
the
sense
of
describing
the
class
you
may
sue.
it
can
be,
as
he's
using
it,
describing
the
nature
of
the
injury
or
causation.
what
he
has
done
with
blue
chip
is
take
what
pleases
him
from
it.
there
is
in
blue
chip
a
clear
indication
that
the
purchaser-seller
limitations
are
somewhat
arbitrary
and
that
they
deny
some
deserving
plaintiffs
of
an
opportunity
to
sue.
it
is
mitigated,
however,
this
court
said,
by
the
fact
that
there
can
be
claims
for
relief
under
other
bodies
of
law.
the
example
given
in
the
footnote,
footnote
9,
comes
from
loss
on
securities.
and
it
points
to
the
fact
that
in
the
birnbaum
case
itself,
a
subsequent
suit
was
brought
for
an
accounting.
and
in
that
suit
for
the
accounting,
nonpurchaser-sellers
were
able
to
establish
a
wrong,
injury,
and
causation
and
recover
on
the
same
facts.
what
we
are
here
with
rico
is
another
claim
for
relief.
we
are
not
suing
under
10b-5
and
its
implied
claim
for
relief.
we're
suing
under
the
standard.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
i
think--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--i
think
my
case
does
not
rest
on
the
legislative
history,
and
i'm
willing
to
stick
with
the
text.
nevertheless,
in
the
legislative
history
it's
very
clear,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sedima,
that
one
of
the
reasons
rico
was
not
drafted
as
an
amendment
to
the
antitrust
act,
but
rather
as
a
freestanding
statute
was
to
avoid
precisely
narrow
standing
limitations
of
antitrust
and
proximate
cause--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--the
same
word
in
different
contexts
will
have
different
meanings.
the
meaning
that
it
ought
to
have
in
this
context
is
a
function
of
the
purpose
that
it
serves
in
this
statute.
in
order
to
avoid
precisely
those
narrow
standing
limitations
and
proximate
cause
limitations,
rico
was
drafted
outside
of
the
antitrust
acts,
and
its
liberal
construction
was
enjoined.
if
his
argument
is
plausible
and
my
argument
is
plausible,
that
is
to
say
it's
a
genuine
ambiguity,
the
statute
suggests
that
this
court
ought
to
take
that
construction
of
the
statute
that
enhances
its
remedial
purposes
and
not--
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
--well,
absolutely.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
but
the
purchaser-seller
limitation
deals
with
the
class
who
consume,
not
the
nature
of
the
injury
or
the
causation
relationship.
if
it
were
otherwise,
footnote
9
in
the
court's
opinion
in
blue
chip
would
no
longer
have
meaning.
let
me
refer
to
one
other
case.
the
language,
1934
act
is
squarely
interpreted
by
this
court
in
national
securities...
sec
v.
national
security...
to
refer
to
coverage...
that
is,
the
wrongdoer's
conduct,
and
not
to
the
status
of
the
plaintiff.
it
is
precisely
that
language
in
1969
that
was
incorporated
into
rico.
since
1970,
this
court
has
decided
10
rico
appeals.
each
time,
properly,
it
has
declined
to
add
language
to
the
statute
that
was
not
there:
not
organized
crime,
not
legitimate,
not
racketeering,
not
competitive.
indeed,
the
failure
to
add
racketeering
and
competitive
in
sedima
would
seem
a
fortiori
to
dictate
the
result
in
this
case.
not
in
an
enterprise
in
rusello,
not
only
in
tafflin,
and
it
is
not
subtracted
from
property
legal
fees.
we
think
that
this
court
in
this
case
ought
not
to
depart
from
that
well-reasoned
line...
unbroken
line
of
decisions,
and
add
purchaser-seller
to
rico.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
well,
i
teach
at
notre
dame,
and
we
from
time
to
time
act
when
the
odds
are
against
us,
unfortunately,
not
always
successfully,
as
last
weekend
shows.
mr.
g.
robert
blakey
thank
you.
