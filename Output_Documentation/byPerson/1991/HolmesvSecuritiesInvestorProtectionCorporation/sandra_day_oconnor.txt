but
your
argument
depends
on
our
looking
first
to
find
out
in
what
capacity
sipc
brought
the
suit,
whether
it
was
subrogee
for
purchasers
of
manipulated
securities
or
something
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
what
if
the
predicate
acts
relied
on
are
wire
fraud
or
mail
fraud?
does
that
alter
the
analysis
in
some
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
for
wire
fraud
or
for
mail
fraud,
do
you
still
have
to...
you
say
there
still
has
to
be
a
purchaser
or
seller?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
questions,
though,
about
how
direct
the
injury
must
be
for
purposes
of
a
rico
claim?
there's
some
discussion
of
that
in
some
lower
court
cases,
i
take
it,
dealing
with
shareholders
of
corporations
and
union
members
and
the
like.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
argument
is
made
here
that
sipc
similarly
stands
in
an
indirect
relationship
to
this
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
explain
to
me,
if
you
would,
please,
the
capacity
in
which
sipc's
suit
is
before
us
here?
are
you
subrogated?
is
sipc
suing
as
a
subrogee
of
anybody
who
had
bought
manipulated
securities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
i
ask
the
question
in
another
way?
some
courts
have
spoken
of
it
in
terms
of
a
direct
injury
requirement.
is
it
your
position
that
if
there
is
such
a
requirement
for
a
rico
cause
of
action,
that
the
customers
who
were
not
purchasers
of
the
manipulated
securities
were
nonetheless
directly
injured?
