90-727.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the

states
court
of
appeals
for

ninth
circuit.
acting
under
the
securities
investor
protection
act,
the
respondent,
securities
investor
protection
corporation
which
we
have
been
calling
sipc,
caused
the
liquidation
of
two
security
broker
dealers
after
they
failed
to
meet
obligations
to
their
customers.
under
the
statute,
sipc
must
reimburse
customers
of
broker
dealers
who
lose
money
after
their
broker
dealer
becomes
insolvent,
and
sipc
says
it
had
to
pay
millions
of
dollars
to
the
customers
of
the
two
broker
dealers
at
issue
here.
sipc
sought
to
recoup
some
of
the
millions
by
suing
petitioners,
robert
holmes
and
others,
saying
that
they
had
conspired
to
manipulate
the
price
of
stocks
that
the
broker
dealers
have
bought
some
of
the
stocks
at
inflated
prices,
that
the
stock
price
later
plummeted
because
the
fraud
came
to
light,
and
that
this
forced
the
broker
dealers
into
insolvency
triggering
sipc's
duty
to
reimburse
the
customers
and
of
course,
ultimately
causing
sipc's
loses.
sipc
alleged
that
by
doing
so,
the
conspirators
broke
the
securities
laws
for
which
sipc
could
sue
them
under
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
or
the
rico
statute.
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
holmes
saying,
among
other
things,
that
sipc
did
not
have
standing
to
sue
the
conspirators
because
sipc
itself
had
never
bought
any
of
the
manipulated
stocks.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
rico
does
not
require
that
a
plaintiff
buy
a
security
to
be
allowed
to
sue.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
intern
but
on
a
different
ground.
we
think
that
a
plaintiff
cannot
sue
under
the
rico
statute
unless
the
defendant's
acts
proximately
caused
the
plaintiff's
injury.
that
means
that
there
must
be
a
direct
relationship
between
the
plaintiff's
injury
and
the
defendant's
conduct,
a
requirement
that
sipc
cannot
meet.
sipc
claims
to
have
sued
in
two
different
capacities.
first,
it
says
that
it
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
broker
dealers'
customers
and
can
assert
any
right
the
customers
could
assert.
but
even
if
this
is
true,
the
link
between
the
customer's
injury
and
the
conspirators'
act
is
too
attenuated
to
allow
recovery
since
the
customers
were
harmed
only
because
the
conspirators
first
injured
the
broker
dealers.
second,
sipc
says
that
a
section
of
the
statute
entitles
it
to
recover.
however,
we
think
that
the
provision
in
question
deals
only
with
intervention
and
is
thus,
beside
the
point
of
the
issue
before
us.
because
we
hold
that
the
conspirators'
acts
did
not
approximately
caused
sipc's
injury,
we
need
not
determine
whether
a
plaintiff
suing
under
the
rico
statute
and
alleging
that
the
defendant
broke
the
securities
law
must
always
have
been
a
buyer
or
a
seller
of
the
security
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
sue.
