mr.
jack
i.
samet
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
this
case
presents
is
whether
a
party,
which
was
neither
a
purchaser
nor
seller
of
securities,
and
for
that
reason
lacks
standing
to
sue
for
securities
fraud
under
the
exchange
act,
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5,
may
nevertheless
sue
for
the
same
conduct...
security-based
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities...
as
a
predicate
act
of
racketeering
activity
under
rico.
in
order
to
answer
this
question,
the
court
will
be
called
upon
to
construe
section
1964--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--yes,
a
predicate
act
of
racketeering
activity.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
well,
i
think
they're
pretty
much--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--well,
i
would
prefer
the
term
"predicate
act"
because
it's
neutral.
as
you'll
see
in
my
argument,
i
don't
think
necessarily
all
of
these
things
are
crimes,
although
i
believe
the
overwhelming
import
in
the
criminal
portion
of
rico
is
to
delineate
crimes.
i
think
when
we're
talking
about--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--civil
rico,
we're
not
speaking
about
crimes.
i
think
we're
speaking
about
a
crime
only
in
so
far
as
it
a...
as
it
is
a
component
of
an
element
of
a
civil
cause
of
action.
i
think
it
makes
a
difference,
and
i'll
try
to
get
to
that.
but
i
do
agree
that
rico
is
a
criminal
act,
and
that
it
purports
to
delineate
crimes,
but
it
also
purports
to
delineate
acts
more
generally.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
you're
absolutely
correct.
that
is
exactly--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--the
act...
well,
there
are
different
schools
of
thought
as
to
what--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--no,
there
are
different
schools
of
thought
as
to
exactly
what
the
nature
of
the
conduct
is
that
defines
the
rico
predicate
acts.
in
any
event,
this
court
will
be
called
upon
to
construe
the
following
three
key
phrases.
section
1964(c)
states,
any
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property...
and
the
court
will
be
called
upon
to
construe
the
meaning
of
"injured
in
his
business
or
property.
"
--by
reason
of...
and
the
court
will
be
called
upon
to
construe
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
1962.
and
that,
justice
white,
gets
into
your
question
about
what
is
a
violation
of
1962.
i
think
the
rico
act
means
1962
defines
certain
wrongful
acts
or
crimes,
whatever
you
like,
and
it
then
incorporates...
it
says
you
cannot
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
with
respect
to
these
crimes
or
acts.
and
then
the
definition
of
racketeering
activity
in
section
1961
lists
about
36
crimes
or
acts,
and
one
of
them
is
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
that's
the
one
we'll
be
talking
about
today.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
sure.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i
must
assume
it
in
this
posture
of
the
case
because
we're
here
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
at
trial
we'll
contest
it,
but
i
do
agree
that
for
purpose
of
this
argument
we
assume
there
was
a
fraud
because
it--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--well,
no,
i
think
not.
because
there
was
no
standing.
i
think,
absent
standing,
there--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--well,
i
think
it
does
the
way...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
because
i
think...
well,
i
do
make
those
additional
arguments,
but
i
think
standing
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
the
civil
cause
of
action,
which
is
what
i
think
rico
intends
to
incorporate
when
it
talks
about
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
no,
but
i
think
that
the
blue
chip
means
that
there's
no
10b
violation
for
which
anyone
can
sue
if
there's
no
standing.
and
rico
is
intended,
i
believe,
to
incorporate
the
wisdom
of
blue
chip.
so
i
think
they
are
related
to
each
other.
i
think...
i
think
that
the
restatement
of
the
question
here
essentially
is,
is
the
securities
investor
protection
corporation,
sipc,
a
person
or
a
party
that
was
injured
by
reason
of
this
alleged
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
not
at
all,
your
honor.
not
at
all,
chief
justice.
for
the
reason
that
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
and
the
law
is
that
sipc
is
not
subrogated
to
any
of
those
claims.
there
are
two...
sipc
essentially
paid
out
money
to
two
categories
of
investors,
people
who
were
customers
of
the
failed
brokerage
firm.
they
paid
out
money
to
investors
who
bought
and
sold
the
allegedly
manipulated
securities,
and
they
paid
out
money
to
people
who
didn't.
now,
as
to
the
people
who
did
buy
and
sell
the
allegedly
manipulated
securities,
they
commenced
a
class
action.
it
was
settled.
they
got
their
recovery.
so
sipc
can't
be
subrogated
to
their
claim,
because
it's
already
been
exercised.
as
to
the
people
who
didn't
buy
or
sell
the
allegedly
manipulated
securities,
sipc
can't
be
subrogated
to
their
claim
because
they,
like
sipc,
are
too
remote
from
the
event
to
have
a
claim
in
the
first
place.
furthermore,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
only
way
sipc
can
acquire
a
subrogation
right...
and
this
is
in
an
earlier
case.
this
is
the
third
time
this
case
has
reached
the
ninth
circuit.
in
an
earlier
case,
which
is
in
the
record,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
sipc
is
subrogated
to
any
fraud
claims
if
and
only
if
the
brokers
who
sipc
came
in
to
pay
out
exercised
unauthorized
use
of
customer
funds
to
buy
the
manipulated
securities.
that
didn't
happen.
discovery
has
established
that
didn't
happen,
so
there's
no
fraud
claim
for
sipc
to
be
subrogated
to.
and
therefore,
sipc
cannot
come
here
as
a
subrogee.
we
must
look
at
sipc
only
as
sipc
and
ensure,
if
you
will,
that
paid
out
monies,
and
not
as
a
subrogee,
because
there
is
no
subrogation.
in
addition,
your
honor...
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--sure.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i
don't
think
it
worked
that
way.
it
probably
should
have--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--that's
the
problem.
that's...
you
have
hit,
justice
stevens,
on
exactly
the
problem
of
allowing
sipc
a
recovery
here.
there
would
be
a
double
recovery,
and
since
it's
rico,
it
would
be
a
sextuple
recovery.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i
don't
think
you
do.
sipc's
brief
raises
them,
and
therefore,
i'm
responding
to
the
questions
from
the
court
and
anticipating
them
in
sipc's
position.
but
i
will
tell
you,
totally
apart
from
the
uniqueness
of
sipc...
and
i
agree,
that's
not
the
larger,
more
interesting
question.
the
larger,
more
interesting
question
is
do
we
have...
you're
looking
at
sipc
as
sipc,
not
as
a
subrogee...
do
we
have
a
situation
in
which
sipc
was
injured
by
reason
of
the
alleged
violation.
and
i'd
like
to
get
into
the
facts
and
show
why
i
think
we
do
not
have
such
a
situation.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
no.
if
in
fact
it
was
a
valid
subrogation
to
people
who
had
a
claim,
who
were
themselves
purchasers
and
seilers
of
securities,
there
would
be
a...
there
would
be
standing,
and
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
the
argument
i'm
making.
i'm
making
the
argument--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--unfortunately,
in
part,
it
does.
this
is
not
a
case
that
purely
raises
the
purchaser-seller
issue.
it
does
raise
these
related
questions
of
who
sipc
is
and
what
it
did.
but
i'm
trying
to
address,
and
i
think
the
court
is
most
interested
in,
the
pure
question.
unfortunately,
the
question
of
less
general
interest
comes
from
this
record
and
cannot
be
avoided.
but
discussing
the
pure
general
question
of
do
we
have
here...
is
sipc,
in
its
own
capacity,
a
purchaser
or
seller
of
securities,
which
it
clearly
was
not,
and
therefore,
does
it
have
standing,
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
key
phrases
in
rico.
first,
"the
injured
in
his
business
or
property.
"
phrase.
what
that
has
come
to
mean
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
is
essentially
that
a
person
must
be
directly
injured
in
their
business
or
property.
if,
for
example,
a
corporation
is
the
target
of
a
racketeering
act,
a
shareholder
cannot
sue
for
injury
to
the
corporation
because
the
shareholder
was
not
the
direct
victim;
the
corporation
was.
cases
have
held
that
if
a
union
is
the
target
of
racketeering
activity,
the
union
member
may
not
sue
for
rico
because
it
was
not
the
directly
injured
victim;
the
union
was.
well,
here--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--absolutely.
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
here...
indeed,
i
think
the
purchase
of
seller
implication
in
the
doctrine
of
standing
comes
directly
from
the
general
principals
of
rico.
you
don't
have
to
focus
on
securities
law
to
reach
the
same
conclusion.
i
completely
agree
with
you,
justice
kennedy,
that
looking
at
the
general
concept
of
rico,
sipc
here
is
not
a
person
who
was
directly
injured.
the
direct
victims--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--it
doesn't
matter,
justice
o'connor.
you
reach
the
same
result
either
way
because,
on
this
record,
there
is
nothing
for
sipc
to
be
subrogated
to,
and
therefore,
this
court
is
faced
with
a
pure
question.
if
there
were
a
viable
argument
that
sipc
is
subrogated
to
a
claim,
then
you
could
go
off
on
a
subrogation
issue.
but
there
isn't.
sipc
isn't
subrogated
to
anything.
i'm
addressing
that
because
sipc
talks
about
it.
but
if
one
accepts
the
notion
that
sipc
isn't
subrogated
to
anything,
then
one
reaches
the
general
question.
and
i
think
that's
this
case.
i
think
sipc
is
subrogated
to
nothing,
and
we
reach
the
general
question.
and
the
general
question...
the
first
proposition
on
the
general
question
is
that
we
do
not
have
a
party
that
was
directly
injured.
sipc
was
not
directly
injured.
if
there
were
direct
victims,
it
were
the
purchasers
and
sellers
of
these
allegedly
manipulated
securities,
not
sipc.
the
second
important
point,
i
believe,
is
that
any
injury
to
sipc
was
not
by
reason
of
the
alleged
fraud
in...
of
the
sale
of
securities.
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
sedima,
sipc
paying
out
money.
here
there
were
many,
many
intervening
events.
the
harm
complained
of
operated
on
the
purchasers
and
sellers
of
securities.
now,
in
addition,
for
that
to
happen,
it
had
to
be
the
case
that
these
two
brokerage
firms
took
a
large
position
in
the
allegedly
manipulated
securities.
and
it
had
to
be
the
case
that
the
brokerage
firms
were
otherwise
in
precarious
financial
condition,
and
therefore,
taking
this
position
and
these
securities
caused
their
financial
demise.
it
had
to
be
the
case
that
sipc
comes
in
and
says,
well,
let's
make
the
failure
of
these
brokerage
firms
subject
to
sipa.
and
it
had
to
be
the
case
that
the
composition
of
the
assets
of
the
defunct
brokerage
firms
was
such
that
they
could
not
pay
out
or
simply
give
to
the
customers
of
the
brokerage
firms
their
securities.
all
of
those
events,
none
of
which
were
intended
or
foreseen
by
the
persons
that
allegedly
committed
the
securities
fraud,
had
to
occur
before
sipc
would
sustain
the
loss
that
it
sustained.
this
is
causation
run
rampant,
attenuated
causation,
the
kind
of
speculation
in
causation
that
goes
way
beyond
the
bounds
of
proximate
cause
and
should
not
be
tolerated.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
well,
we
have
an
even
clearer
case
here
because
the
brokerage
firm...
the
trustees
of
the
brokerage
firm
are
themselves
parties
to
the
action,
the
brokerage
firm
did
take
a
position
in
the
securities,
and
we're
not
challenging
the
trustees'
standing.
we're
challenging
sipc's
standing.
so
i
agree
with
the
implication
of
your
question
that
if
the
brokerage
firm
was
itself
a
purchaser
or
seller,
we
wouldn't
have
the
argument
we
have.
but
it's
sipc
that's
coming
in,
and
they're
not
a
purchaser
or
seller,
and
therefore,
we
have
the
argument
on
standing
that
we
wouldn't
if
the
brokerage
firm
were
the
only
plaintiff,
or
the
trustees
were
the
only
plaintiffs.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
that
would
be
a
closer,
harder
question.
it's
not
the
question
we
now
have--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--well,
that's
the
one
you
don't
have
to
write
an
opinion
on.
i
would--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
well,
i
think
the
logic
of
the
general
approach,
and
i
agree
you
presented
a
tougher
case
than
the
one
we
have
here
today,
but
the
logic
of
the
general
approach
is
that
if
you
ain't
a
purchaser
or
seller,
you
ain't
got
standing.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
well,
i
think
any
question
this
court
poses,
i
recognize
is
a
hard
question.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
no,
a
but-for
cause
is
not
a--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--well,
are
you
using
direct
cause
in
the
sense
of
proximate
cause
or
not
in
your
question?
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i
do.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
absolutely.
and
that's
what
we
have--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--that's
what
we...
as
i
say,
i'm
trying
to
be
polite
and
respectful.
i
think
i've
answered
the
question,
i
didn't
find
it
that
hard
to
do.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
maybe
it
wasn't
that
hard,
but
in
any
event--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--the
answer
is,
in
my
view,
if
you
are
not
a
purchaser
or
seller
you
are
not
causally
connected,
proximate
cause,
by
reason
of
the
alleged
harm.
that's
my
answer.
but
again,
i
can
see
where
you're
coming
from,
and
i
think
i
can--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--yes.
and
that's
justice
scalia...
that's
the
point
in
justice
scalia's
question.
there's
a
difference
between
but-for
causation
and
proximate
causation,
and
i
do
want
to
be
clear
about
that,
if
i
wasn't
clear
about
anything
else.
but-for
causation
is
not
enough
to
establish
the
by
reason
of
requirement
to
be
satisfied.
it's
got
to
be
proximate
causation.
i
don't
think
there
is
proximate
causation
if
you're
not
a
purchaser
or
seller
of
securities.
i
don't
think
you
can
get
that
causal
connection.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i'm
very
glad
you
raised
that
question.
i
don't
think
it
alters
the
analysis
at
all.
and
indeed,
what
has
happened
in
litigation
generally,
and
in
this
litigation,
is
people
with
a
simple
turn
of
phrase...
and
that's
what
sipc
did
in
this
complaint,
they
pled
alternatively
securities
fraud
and/or
wire
and
mail
fraud.
but
the
analysis
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
yes,
for
the
reason
that
the
provisions
of
1964(c),
the
requirement
that
injury
be
to
a
person's
business
or
property,
meaning
direct
injury,
and
that
the
injury
be
by
reason
of,
meaning
proximate
causal
connection,
those
two
requirements
come
from
1964(c),
which
applies
to
all
predicate
acts.
and
therefore,
they
apply
whether
you're
talking
wire/mail
fraud,
or
whether
you're
talking
securities
fraud.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
that's
absolutely
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
you
were
correct
in
saying
as
presented
so
far.
i've
not
gotten
to
the
point
yet,
as
i'm
about
to,
to
discuss
blue
chip.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i've
got
at
least
three,
yes.
three,
and
i'll
go
more
if
i'm
permitted.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i
will
keep
going
as
long
as
i
can.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
yes.
and
the
third...
the
third
one
has
to
do
with
in
effect,
blue
chip,
and
that
is
this:
that
the
rico
predicate
act
is
defined
as
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
and
that's
a
very
interesting
definition
of
a
predicate
act,
it
contrasts
with
the
other
predicate
acts
in
the
statute.
all
the
other
predicate
acts
define
crimes
as
crimes,
for
example,
murder,
kidnappings,
state
crimes...
and
also
federal
crimes
by
citation
to
federal
statutes.
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
parallel
incorporation
of
a
securities
crime,
it
should
have
said,
for
example,
any
violation
of
section
32
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
which
is
what
criminalizes
securities
law
violations.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
something
much
more
narrow.
it
says
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
it
also
doesn't
say
any
fraud
in
connection
with
securities.
that
would
be
fraud.
but
no,
this
predicate
act
is
more
narrowly
drafted.
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
that
makes
the
concept
of
sale
central.
and
that
brings
us,
in
my
view,
to
the
chief
justice's
excellent
opinion
when
he
was
an
associate
justice
in
blue
chip
stamp,
which
spoke
about
what
the
requirements
were
for
standing
with
respect
to
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities.
and
those
principles...
that
decision
in
1975,
was
based
upon,
and
involved
from
a
principal
of
law
back
in
the
birnbaum
case,
dating
back
to
1952,
a
second
circuit
case.
and
those
principles
were
accepted
ever
since
1952,
even
earlier,
really.
they've
existed
in
securities
law
for
40
years,
and
when
rico
was
passed
in
1970,
congress
reflected
no
intention
to
overrule,
subvert,
circumvent,
do
away
with,
existing
securities
laws,
principles,
and
decisions.
and
so
that
standing
limitation
that
comes
from
blue
chip
should
be
carried
forward
when
looking
at
rico.
and
rico
talks
about
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities
because
that's
a
piece
of
learning,
basic
learning,
about
what
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities
is
and
involved,
and
it's
a
settled,
litigated
matter
at
the
supreme
court
level,
that
is
a
decision
that
there
was
no
objection
to
at
all
anywhere
in
the
congressional
history
of
rico.
so
it
seems
to
me
we
have
here
all
but
an
incorporation
by
reference
in
the
listing
of
predicate
acts
of
this
decision
in
blue
chip,
and
the
whole
developed
notions
of
securities
law
and
standing
surrounding
it.
and
they
carry
with
it
certain
principles
of
standing.
congress
didn't
intend
to
overrule
those
principles.
they
should
be
carried
forward
into
rico
when
rico
incorporates
fraud
in
the
sale
of
securities
as
a
predicate
act.
so
those
are
the
principal
reasons
why
i
think
essentially
we
have
a
situation
where
the
very
language
of
section
1964(c)
in
its
three
component
parts,
"injured
in
his
business
or
property.
"
rico
either
because
of
the
way
rico
was
drafted
or
because
of
what
rico
incorporates
by
reference.
but
either
way,
one
reaches
the
same
result.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
arguments
that
i've
seen
in
sipc's
brief,
and
i'm
sure
that
the
court
has
looked
at
them
and
has
considered
them,
and
i'd
like
to
comment
on
them
for
a
moment.
one
has
to
do
with
the
principle
of
broad
construction.
sipc
says
rico
is
to
be
construed
broadly.
true
enough.
rico
is
to
be
construed
broadly.
but
broad
construction
does
not
mean
construction
in
contradiction
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
what
we
are
arguing
here--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--this
statute
says
it.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
the
statute
says
it.
and
also,
i
think
that
this
court
has
managed
to
decide
cases
by
not
viewing
the
statutory
mandate
to
construe
rico
broadly
as
central
to
this
court's
decision.
i
think
that's
a
correct
approach.
i
don't
think--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--the
statute
at
some
point
says...
i
don't
have
the
section
offhand...
says
that
rico
is
to
be
construed
liberally
to
effectuate
its
remedial
purposes.
that's
in
the
rico
statute.
that's
a
statutory
mandate.
i
don't
think
that
statutory
mandate
need
or
should
govern
or
even
applies
to
your
decision,
but
sipc
thinks
it
does.
it's
in
their
brief,
so
i'm
raising
it
to
talk
about.
i
think
that
all
"broad
meaning"
means
is
that
you
should
look
at
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
apply
them
fairly.
and
when
one
does
that
here,
one
reaches
a
conclusion,
i
believe,
that
there's
no
standing.
so
i
don't
think
the
requirement
that
rico
be
construed
broadly,
if
it
is
a
requirement,
need
dictate
your
decision.
the
second
argument
that
sipc
has
raised,
which
i
think
should
not
persuade
this
court...
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
it
just
to
be
sure,
if
there
are
any
questions
on
it...
has
to
do
with
the
express
and
implied
limitation
or
differentiation.
sipc
says,
pointing
back
to
the
blue
chip
decision...
which
sipc...
by
the
way,
sipc
doesn't
even
recognize
it's
bound
by
blue
chip.
in
one
of
it's
footnotes,
sipc
suggests
that
blue
chip,
unfortunately
precludes
sipc
from
recovering.
blue
chip...
it's
not
unfortunate,
it's
correct
law.
but
in
any
event,
blue
chip
evolved
from
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5,
and
judicially
implied
causes
of
action.
rico,
of
course,
is
express.
the
ninth
circuit
and
sipc
have
tended
to
put
significance
of
that
and
have
said
that
because
rico
is
express
and
blue
chip
is
dealing
with
implied
remedy,
somehow
the
construction
of
them
should
be
different,
or
the
construction
of
rico
should
be
more
broad
because
one
is
dealing
with
an
express
statute.
but
if
one
looks
at
what
it
is
that's
expressed
in
1964(c),
what
the
express...
statute
expresses,
it
has
the
very
limitations
on
it
that
we
are
arguing
for...
namely,
that
the
injury
must
be
by
reason
of,
and
it
must
be
injury
to
the
business
or
property
of
the
claimant.
now
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
case,
which
again
is
unique
to
sipc,
does
not
involve
the
general
principal,
but
i
think
it
needs
to
be
address
only
because
i
think
this
court
should
deal
with
the
general
principal,
and
it
would
be
unfortunate...
unfortunate,
i
think,
for
the
case
law
in
general...
if
the
court
focuses
only
on
the
nature
of
sipc,
so
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
that
for
a
second.
because
sipc
argues
that
they
have
a
special
status,
and
somehow,
whatever
the
general
rule
is
should
not
apply
to
them.
that's
in
sipc's
brief.
i'd
like
to
make
clear,
in
the
event
it
isn't
already
so,
that
sipc
is
not
a
government
agency,
that
sipc
is
not
a
successor
in
interest
to
the
brokerage
firm.
that's
the
trustees.
and
the
trustee
standing
is
undisputed.
they've
got
standing.
they're
in
the
case.
that
sipc
is
not
an
agency
trained
in
prosecutorial
discretion.
sipc
is
not
the
department
of
justice;
sipc
is
not
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
though
sipc
is
statutorily
mandated,
it
is
essentially
mandated,
it
is
a
private
system
of
mandatory
assessments
against
securities
brokerage
firms.
so
i
don't
think
that
sipc
deserves
that
the
special
status
that
would
be
accorded
the
department
of
justice
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
this
isn't
the
department
of
justice;
it
isn't
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
that's
a
matter
of
dispute.
i
would
say
that
we
could
look
at
the
record
and
argue
about
it.
but
sipc
would
say
that
they
are
subrogated.
we
would
say
that
they
are
subrogated
only
to
claims
against
the
brokers
and
not
necessarily
to
all
third-party
claims.
and
we
would
say
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
this
case
that
they're
not
subrogated
to
claims
against...
to
fraud
claims
against
third
parties.
and
sipc
did
not
appeal
that
determination.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
no,
i
think
if
i
take
the
position
they're
subrogated,
then
maybe
they
can...
they
can
acquire
the
claim
of
a
purchaser
of
seller.
if
i
take
the
position
they're
not
subrogated,
they
can't
get
near
a
purchaser
or
seller.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i'm
sorrier.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i
don't
intend
to
use
them
all
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
but
just
two
or
three
brief
points.
first,
it
became
clear
during
professor
blakey's
remarks
that
sipc
is
here
as
a
subrogee.
and
i'd
like
to
make
two
comments
about
their
position
as
a
subrogee.
first,
that
the
concept
of
subrogation
is
limited
to
get
reimbursement
for
what
you
paid.
sipc
isn't
seeking
reimbursement
for
what
they
paid.
they're
seeking
treble
damages
under
rico.
so
the
whole
idea
of
subrogation
and
rico
are
inconsistent
because
rico,
1964(c),
mandates
treble
damages.
it
says,
any
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
a
violation,
shall
sue
and
shall
recover
threefold
the
damages.
that's
not
subrogation.
that's
an
entirely
different
notion.
so
the
concept
of
rico--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--exactly.
that's
point
1.
point
2,
sipc
says
it's
here
as
a
real
partied
interest
in
the
liquidation
proceedings.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
isn't
a
liquidation
proceeding.
the
sipa
statute
gives
sipc
power
to
appear
as
a
real
party
in
liquidation
proceedings.
but
this
is
a
rico
action,
not
a
liquidation
proceeding.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
yes,
but--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--but
that
doesn't
give
them
standing.
for
example,
sipc
wouldn't
have--
mr.
jack
i.
samet
--okay.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
but
this
is
the
claim
that
we're
discussing:
sipc's
power
to
assert.
it's
as
though
sipc
came
into
that
terrorist
airplane
crash,
having
nothing
to
do
with
it,
and
say,
well,
we're
a
party
to
all
proceedings.
we
have
the
power
to
get
in
here.
sipc
must
show
it
has
the
standing
on
a
specific
case
basis
and
its
authorization
to
appear
as
a
real
party
in
liquidation
proceedings
doesn't
give
it
standing
here.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
yes,
that
is
exactly
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
but
third
of
all,
we
think
that
the
blue
chip
case
was
right
as
it
applied
to
securities
law,
and
is
even
more
right,
even
though
it
didn't
address
rico,
because
didn't...
it
wasn't
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
well,
of
course
we
all
know
the
author
of
that
decision
sits
on
this
court
and
is
best...
in
the
best
position
to
describe
what
the
decision
meant.
but
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
mr.
jack
i.
samet
i'm
sure
he
would
make
very
clear
what
he
means,
but
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
he
meant,
to
be
corrected,
i'm
sure,
by
him.
[laughter]
i
think
that
the
policy
considerations
in
blue
chip,
the
concept
of
vexatious
litigation,
the
concept
of
strikes,
the
concept
of
bludgeoning
settlements
are
all
the
more
egregious
in
rico
than
they
were
in
the
securities
law
because
the
stakes
are
three
times
as
high.
and
it's
interesting,
in
the
amicus
here,
it's
interesting
to
see
who
the
amici
are.
they
are
a
group
of
plaintiffs'
attorneys.
and
what
has
happened
here
is
there
has
been
massive
abuse
of
civil
rico.
president
bush,
in
his
civil
justice
reform
act,
just
the
other
day,
was
talking
about
the
excesses
of
civil
litigation.
in
today's
wall
street
journal,
there's
an
article
about
the
sec
is
saying
they're
concerned
about
the
excesses
of
rico
civil
abuse.
and
i
think
what
has
happened
is
the
very
concerns
that
were
soundly
described
in
blue
chip
are
even
more
egregious
in
the
rico
area.
and
hopefully
this
court
will
put
a
stop
to
it.
thank
you.
