justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
surprised
you
found
that
a
hard
question,
mr.
samet.
i...
given
your
approach,
i
would
think
that's
an
easy
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
you
think
that
somehow,
simply
because
you
are
a
but
for...
a
but-for
cause
is
a
direct
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
that
the
question
showed
is
a
clear
but-for
cause.
is
there
no
difference
between
a
but-for
cause
and
a
direct
cause?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
way
you're
using
it,
isn't
it?
i'm
using
it
the
way
you're
using
it.
i
thought
you
meant
proximate
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
one
could
be
a
but-for
cause
without
being
a
proximate
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
why
was
it
a
hard
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
again,
what
is
the
answer?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
might
think
of
more
on
the
way,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
statute
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
purchaser
or
seller's
going
to
sue.
well,
i
don't
understand.
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
any
other
statute
where
there
is
not
some
proximity
requirement
placed
upon
the
ability
to
recover.
i
mean,
really
what
you're
saying
is
if
by
reason
of
this
fraud
somehow
somebody's
uncle
got
mad
and
cut
them
out
of
the
will,
they
would
have
a
cause
of
action
under
rico
so
long
as
they
could
establish
that
causality.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
cases
on
that?
that
surprises
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
defrauded
bidder
would
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean
the
bidder
who
would
have
gotten
it
but
for
the
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
basis
of
defrauding
or
on
the
basis
of
unfair
business
practices?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
terrorist
in
the
airplane
is
different.
these
are
other
people
who
are
harmed
proximately
by
the
same
act,
although
they
are
not
the
persons
who
have
the
cause
of
action
for
the
fraud.
but
they
are
proximately
harmed
by
the
same
act.
here
you
have
a
person
who
is
further
down
the
line.
every
time
you
harm
somebody
you
harm
other
people
who
are
dependent
on
that
somebody.
and
that's
what
occurred
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
they
sue?
what
money
was
obtained
from
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
anyone
that
is
caused
a
loss
by
the
deceiving
of
someone
else
has
a
cause
of
action
for
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
all
subsequent
consequences
of
the
fraud.
they
are
not
themselves
a
defrauding.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it's
called
a
sinking,
though.
it's
not
called
fraud.
fraud
means
obtaining
money
or
property
from
someone.
it
doesn't
mean
tricking
someone
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
saying
it
means
common-law
deceit.
i
am
saying
that
it
means
obtaining
money
or
property
from
someone.
and
your
claim
here
is
not
based
upon...
even
on
this
other
category
of
persons,
is
not
based
on
obtaining
any
money
or
property
from
them.
they
are
consequentially
injured
because
of
the
wrongful
obtaining
of
property
and
money
from
somebody
else.
it's
just
one
of
the
ripples
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
took
them
down
directly.
when
you
took
the
plane
down,
you
took
them
down
directly.
they
didn't
go
down
as
a
result
of
the
other
people
going
down.
the
analog
to
your
plane
incident
is
the
business
run
by
the
person
who
was
bombed
fails
because
he's
no
longer
managing
it.
that's
the
analog
to
what's
going
on
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
fact?
what
fact
is
found
below
that
i
am
contradicting?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
the
odds
are
against
you
this
time.
[laughter]
