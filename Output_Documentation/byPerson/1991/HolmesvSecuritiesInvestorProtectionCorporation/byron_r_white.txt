white
did
you
say
predicate
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
predicate
crime,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
predicate
violation
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
you're
going
to
be...
i
suppose
you're
going
to
be
arguing
that
if
this
conduct
wasn't
a
violation
of
the
securities
law,
it
can't
be
a
predicate
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
you
arguing
then
that
the
act
has
to
be
a
violation
of
the
securities
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry
i
interrupted.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
getting
to
the
third
point,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
well,
anyway,
you've
gotten...
you've
got
through
two
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
still
won
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
rationale
you
just
stated.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
strange.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
are
claiming
that
you
have
been
injured
in
your
business
or
property.
and
i
suppose
the
antitrust
laws
say
that
a
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property
can
recover
treble
damages
if
it's
by
reason
of
an
antitrust
violation.
and
yet
we
say
that...
we
say
that
only
those
people
who
are
directly
injured
can
recover.
an
indirect
purchaser
cannot.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
not
a
very
popular
decision
among
plaintiffs'
lawyers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
used
that
language
"anybody
injured
in
his
business
or
property.
"
and
the
antitrust
laws,
you're
not
injured
in
your
business
or
property,
within
the
meaning
of
the
antitrust
laws,
if
you're
an
indirect
purchaser
rather
than
a
direct
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
say...
you
seem
to
concede
that
surely
there
are
some
kinds
of
injuries
that
will
be...
that
would
be
caused
by
a
securities
fraud
that
would
not
be
recoverable
under
rico.
some
can
be
too
remote.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
claim
here
is
that
any...
anybody
injured
except
the
purchaser
or
seller
is
just
too
remote
from
the
fraud
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
wouldn't
be
suing
under
rico
if
you
were
just
suing
for
subrogation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
did
liquidate
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
paid
out
millions
of
dollars
in
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
it
did,
but
it
was
a
liquidation.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
an
insurance
company
coming
in.
