don't
you
have
to
take
it,
then,
a
further
step
that
the
object
of
doing
that
is
essentially
to
protect
the
other
party.
and
by
the
same
reasoning
that
we
accept
the
court's
authority
to
impose
criminal
contempt
sanctions
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
court,
why
doesn't
this
essentially
the
same
reasoning
extend
to
allowing
these
civil
sanctions
whether
it
be
under
rule
11
or
inherent
power
to
protect
the
other
parties
once
they
are
accepted
by
the
court
as
being
before
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
have
we
said
in
criminal
contempt?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you,
don't
you
concede,
i
mean,
you
have
conceded
in
this
case
that
there
would
be
a
criminal
contempt
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
i
mean,
right,
but
that
essentially
goes
to
the
factual
basis
of
the
action
as
opposed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
engage
in
it.
and
why
doesn't
the
protective
justification
for
that
concession
go
as
far
as
conceding
the
issue
here
as
well?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
want
to
be
impatient,
but,
i
mean,
that's
kind
of
the
analytical
structure
of
the
court's
answer.
but
the
ultimate
reason
for
engaging
in
that
kind
of
analytical
exercise
was
a
protective
reason,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
doesn't
the
same
protective
reason
argue
just
as
persuasively
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't,
isn't,
isn't
one
rationale
for
that
that
although
the
court
may
lack
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
finally
adjudicated,
the
court
has
an
article
iii
obligation
to
the
parties
before
it
while
they
are
before
it,
and
isn't
that
sufficient?
