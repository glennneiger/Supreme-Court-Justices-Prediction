justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
don't
lawyers
have
a
special
obligation
under
rule
11
quite
without
reference
to
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
were
the
lawyers
and
the
client
both
sanctioned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
lawyer
can
be
sanctioned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
he
be
sanctioned
under
rule
11?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
disbarment
is
not
a
criminal
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
doesn't
if
the
unprofessional
conduct
takes
place
in
the
course
of
the
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
here
that
the
gravamen
of
the
injury
to
the
court
was
the
misfeasance
of
the
attorney.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
court
has
a
special
authority
over
attorneys
under
rule
11.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
quite
distinguishes
this
case
from
catholic
conference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
leads
to
the
next
point.
isn't
the
litigant's
liability
derivative
of
the
attorney
in
a
sense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
finding
here
that
the
client
conspired
with
the
attorney
or
was
an
accessory
with
the
attorney
in
the
perpetration
of
the
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it's
implicit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
of
the
sanction
against
your
client
is
to
discourage
him
and
others
from
permitting
their
attorneys
to
engage
in
this
sort
of
conduct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
bishops'
case
a
constitutional
case
in
your
view?
