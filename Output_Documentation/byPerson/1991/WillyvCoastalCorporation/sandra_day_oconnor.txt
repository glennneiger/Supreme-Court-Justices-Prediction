if
there
weren't
any
legitimate
basis
for
removal,
do
you
suppose
the
federal
district
court
would
have
the
power
to
sanction
the
party
removing
the
case
wrongfully?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
under
the
court's
inherent
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
would
be
true
for
criminal
contempt
sanctions
for
someone
who
wrongfully
removed
the
case,
but
then
has
an
outburst
in
the
courtroom
and
insults
the
judge
and
the
judge
imposes
a
criminal
sanction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
is
the
article
iii
power
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
united
states
were
not
a
party,
but
there
is
a
suit
between
private
parties
and
there
is
a
wrongful
removal
and
there
is
some
outburst
in
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
kind
of
inherent
power
to
protect
its
own
dignity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
our,
our
cases
in
chambers
against
nasco
and
hutto
against
finney
suggests
that
fee
shifting
sanctions
are
analogous
to
civil
contempt.
and
perhaps
that
answers
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
they
help
you
because
there
there
was
article
iii
jurisdiction
at
one
point
in
those
cases.
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
you.
