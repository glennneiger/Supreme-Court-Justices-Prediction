justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the,
what
if
the
case
goes
up
to
the
appellate
court,
there's
never
been
any
jurisdictional
question
raised,
but
the
appellate,
the
court
of
appeals,
like
it
should,
raises
a
jurisdictional
issue
and
says
there's
no,
never
has
been
any
jurisdiction
in
the
lower
court.
i
suppose
that
you
would
take
the
same
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
your...
your
client
is
in
that
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
went
ahead
with
the
litigation.
you
went
ahead
with
the
litigation
and
filed
a
whole
batch
of
documents
that
were
just
ridiculous.
by--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you,
you
would
also,
i
suppose,
say
that
the,
if
people
are,
a
lot
of
times
litigate
over
jurisdiction.
and
if
it
turns
out
that
the
court
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction,
is
the
court
without
power
to
sanction
attorneys
who
should
be
sanctioned
in
litigating
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
would
think
you're,
i
would
think
if
you
accept
that
you
have
to
accept
some
other
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
concede
then
that
courts
have
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
their
own
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
district
court,
it
thought
it
had
jurisdiction.
it
determined
it.
and
there
you
were,
you
were
stuck
until
you
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
that
the
attorney
could
have
been
held
in
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
criminal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
criminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
whole
point
of
rule
11
is
to
control
the
conduct
of
attorneys.
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
suppose
you
think
personal
jurisdiction
is
another
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if,
what
if
the
reason,
what
if
the
reason
you
don't
have
personal
jurisdiction
is
because
the
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
some
court
is
wrong
in
thinking
it
has
long-arm
jurisdiction
and
wrong
because
the
constitution
says
it's
wrong,
then
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
