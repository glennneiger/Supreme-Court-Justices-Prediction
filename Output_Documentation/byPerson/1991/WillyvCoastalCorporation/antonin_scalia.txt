why,
why
do
you
choose
to
read
that
as
applying
to
cases
in
which
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
does
not
have
jurisdiction
both,
whereas
the
other
statutory
authorities
that
exist
you
insist
must
be
interpreted
to
apply
only
to
cases
where
the
court
has
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
they
don't
say
that,
but
you
say
that's
the
only
reasonable
way
to
read
them.
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that
reasonable
for
the
civil,
but
not
for
the
criminal
sanctions?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
criminal
sanctions,
criminal
contempt
sanctions
could
have
been
imposed
here
if
the
court,
if
the
court
regarded
what
was
being
done
as
contemptuous,
as
an
obstruction
of
its
procedures?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
maness,
you
acknowledge
that
this
thing
is
not
black
and
white
and
that
sometimes
we
allow
consequences
even
when
there's
no
jurisdiction.
why
isn't
a
very
logical
line
to
draw,
and
one
that
would
put
the
catholic
bishops
case
on
the
right
side
of
the
line,
the
line
between
the
litigant
who
submits
himself
to
the
allegedly
wrongful
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
voluntarily
goes
ahead
with
litigation.
in
catholic
bishops,
as
i
recall,
it
was
contended
from
the
outset
by
the
catholic
bishops
that
the
court
had
no
part
of
that
and
had
no
jurisdiction
over
them.
and
we
would
not
allow
them
to
be
punished
by
the
court's
contempt
power.
but
where
you
come
and
willingly
litigate,
why
can't
we
treat
that
differently
and
do
no
damage
to
the
catholic
bishops
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
i'm
sorry.
but
the
point
is
you
did
not
stand
on
your
refusal.
you
did
not
stand
on
your
refusal.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
the
bishops
did.
they
just
refused
to
turn
over
the
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
why
can't
i
put
you
to
that
choice?
justice
antonin
scalia
foreign
sovereigns
do,
they
don't
even
show
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
i
don't
find
the
gray
in
the
constitution.
i
only
find
the
black
and
the
white
in
the
constitution.
we've
passed
that
once
you
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
grays.
we're
just
arguing
over
whether
this
is
one
of
the
shades
of
gray
permitted.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
for,
except
for
the
catholic
conference
of
bishops
case.
why
wouldn't
that
have
come
out
the
other
way
if
it's
inherent
power
that
you
argue
for,
exists
in
this
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
draw
the
line
between
standing
on
your
rights
and
refusing
to
proceed
further
and
that
cannot
be
the
subject
of
a
sanction.
but
if
you
do
proceed
even
while
protesting
all
the
time
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
then
you're
subject.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
question
is
really
that,
whether
it
isn't
enough
to
protect
the
court's
integrity
against
these
assaults
to
have
the
criminal
sanctions
available,
which
you
call,
you
call
the
rule
11
lesser
sanctions,
but
in
one
respect
they're
greater.
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
safeguard,
the
kind
of
protections
that
i
think
the
contumacy
can
be
less
probably
under
rule
11
than
is
needed
for
criminal
sanctions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
certainly
a
reasonable
position.
maybe
there
should
be
a
statute
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
that
argument
about,
you
know,
that
federal
rules
don't
affect
substantive
rights,
wouldn't
that
have,
again,
produced
a
different
result
in
the
conference
of
catholic
bishops
case?
i
mean,
that's
what
stands
between
you
and
what
you
want
to
do,
it
seems
to
me.
that
case
comes
out
differently
if
we
accept
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
only
point
is
that
distinction
is
not
in
rule
11.
if
you're
going
a
constitutional
route,
if
you're
going
in
an
inherent
power
route,
i
think
you
can
make
that
distinction.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can
make
it
in
rule
11.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
your
argument
is
no
substantive
rights
are
affected,
rule
11
simply
covers
this.
it's
an
easy
case.
then
catholic
bishops
was
a
hard
case
and
you
got
it
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
all
you
mean
by
your
rule
11
argument,
it
just
falls
back
onto
the
constitutional
inherent
power
argument,
i'm
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
get
you
very
far.
let's
just
talk
about
inherent
power
then
and
forget
about
rule
11.
