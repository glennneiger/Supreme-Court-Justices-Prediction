justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but,
you're
arguing...
i'm
sorry.
i
was
going
to
say,
do
you
think
that
sanctions
here
are
more
akin
to
criminal
or
civil?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
that
in
catholic
conference
the
bishops,
in
addition
to
contesting
jurisdiction,
filed
fraudulent
and
misleading
documents,
purportedly
in
response
to
the
subpoena...
the
only
sanction
available
to
the
court
is
a
criminal
sanction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
instead
of
a
hypothetical,
what
about
this
very
case?
what
is
the
plaintiff
supposed
to
do?
the
plaintiff
has
filed
the
lawsuit
in
a
state
court,
got
removed
to
the
federal
court,
he
says
i
won't
go
ahead,
he
goes
ahead
and
files
another
lawsuit
in
the
state
court,
gets
removed
again.
how
is
he
ever
going
to
get
his
rights
vindicated
if
he
keeps
getting
removed
to
the
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course.
but
i
don't
see
how
your
line
works
in
this
case.
if
there's
no
contempt,
you
got
no
problem.
and
you
can
also
punish
him
by
criminal
contempt.
your
opponent
agrees
to
that.
but
i
don't
understand
the
line
you
draw
as
applied
to
this
fact
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
but
he's
not
in
effect,
he
continues,
he
litigates
the
jurisdictional
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
did
he
do
any
more
than
contest
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
get
the
procedure.
you're
suggesting
he
had
to
take
an
adverse
judgment
on
the
merits
and
then
appeal
the
jurisdictional
issue
because
he
couldn't
have
appealed
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
right.
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
little
different
choice,
though,
than
the
choice
of
the
subpoenaed
party
in
the
catholic
bishops
case.
that's
the
point
i'm
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
argument
on
punishment,
i'm
not
sure
he
disagrees
with,
with
the
distinction
he
emphasized
from
united
mine
workers
between
civil
and
criminal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
wait
a
minute
on
it.
two
questions.
one,
are
the
procedures
adequate
for
criminal
contempt?
and
secondly,
who
gets
the
money?
is
it
paid
to
the
court
or
paid
to
the
opposite
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
typical
of
criminal
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
we
ever
described
that
kind
of
inherent
power
in
a
case
over
which
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
inherent
power
when
they've
got
no
power
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
inherent
power,
when
we
have
no
power
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
power
to,
now
the
criminal
contempt
power,
that's
easy.
that's
settled
and
so
forth.
but
is
there
any
case,
do
you
have
any
case
that's
really
held
that
in
a
case
of
where
there's
no
jurisdiction
you
can
impose
a
sanction
on
an
adverse
party
to
pay,
you
know,
to
pay
to
your
opponent
in
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
hutto
against
finney,
i
may
be
fuzzy
about
it,
but
that
was
really
a
statutory
case.
that
was
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
award
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
eleventh
amendment,
yes.
but
that
wasn't
the
sole
grounds
for
rejecting
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
since
we
got
along
without
rule
11
for
a
long
time,
that
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
the
world.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
counsel,
you're
talking
about
the
relatively
narrow
category
of
cases.
and
they
really
are
very...
they're
a
fair
number,
but
they're
comparatively
small
in
which
it
turns
out
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
start
with.
and
defeating
your
position
would
in
effect
impose
on
lawyers
a
very
careful
obligation
to
be
darn
sure
about
jurisdiction
before
they
file
rule
11
motions
or
anything
else.
and
your
client
booted
it
on
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
isn't
this
kind
of
case.
that
isn't
this
case.
