mr.
michael
a.
maness
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
section
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution
limits
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
to
nine
carefully
defined
kinds
of
cases
and
controversies
and
none
others.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
district
court
violated
that
constitutional
limitation
by
awarding
attorney's
fees
to
coastal
and
the
other
defendants
as
a
sanction
from
mr.
willy's
asserted
bad
faith
litigation,
even
though
the
federal
court
never
possessed
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
controversy
following
the
defendant's
wrongful
removal
of
the
case
from
a
state
court,
and
even
though
mr.
willy
did
not
impede,
obstruct,
or
delay
the
federal
court's
resolution
of
any
jurisdictional
question,
but
instead
correctly
and
repeatedly,
and
eventually
successfully,
contested
the
federal
court's
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
federal
judicial
power
over
the
case.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
united
states
catholic
conference
against
abortion
rights
mobilization,
incorporated,
that
the
district
court's
sanction
order
violated
article
iii,
and
that
that
order
and
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
mistakenly
affirming
it
are
unconstitutional
and
therefore
should
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
united
states
catholic
conference
against
abortion
rights
mobilization,
incorporated.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
it's
cited
in
our
blue
brief.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
catholic
conference
was
a
1988
decision
of
this
court.
i
would
like
to
state
very
briefly
and
very
quickly
some
relevant
facts
which
are
for
the
most
part
entirely
uncontradicted.
donald
willy
worked
as
an
in-house
environmental
attorney
for
the
a
subsidiary
of
coastal
corporation
in
houston
from
1981
until
1984
when
the
company
fired
him.
in
1985,
represented
by
another
houston
lawyer,
george
young,
mr.
willy
filed
a
state
court
lawsuit
against
coastal
and
other
defendants
alleging
a
number
of
exclusively
state
law
causes
of
action.
the
principal
one
of
these
arose
under
a
texas
supreme
court
decision,
sabine
pilot
service
company
against
hauck,
which
recognizes
a
remedy
in
texas
for
those
whose
employment
is
wrongly
terminated
solely
because
of
their
refusal
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
young's
petition
on
mr.
willy's
behalf
alleged
that
coastal
had
fired
him
because
of
his
refusal
to
falsify
environmental
reports
or
to
participate
in
the
company's
ongoing
violations
of
state
and
federal
environmental
laws
at
several
of
its
facilities.
coastal
and
the
other
defendants
wrongly
removed
the
case
to
the
united
states
district
court
in
houston
on
december
30,
1985,
almost
6
years
ago.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
there
was
more
than
an
arguable
basis
for
the
removal
and
characterized
it
as
having
been
undertaken
in
good
faith.
we
don't,
justice
white,
dispute
that
characterization.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
no.
it
would
not.
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
what
is
implicit
in
this
case
and
something
i
would
like
to
touch
on--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--that's
correct.
our
view
is
that
the
court's
article
iii
power
over
a
case
or
controversy
isn't
determined
by
how
clear
or
how
difficult
the
jurisdictional
question
is.
our
view
is
that
the
court
either
has
the
power
to
act
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
or
it
does
not.
and
if
it
does
not
have
the
power,
then
no
complexity
of
the
jurisdictional
issue
or
no
good
faith
or,
for
that
matter,
bad
faith
be
it
with
the
parties
or
the
judge
can
affect
the
outcome
of
the
decision.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
no,
i
think
our
position
straightforwardly
draws
a
distinction
between
criminal
contempt
penalties--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--basically
it's
that
criminal
contempt
sanctions
implicitly
or
explicitly
are
cases
that
involve
the
united
states.
cases
to
which
the
united
states
is
party
are
specifically
mentioned
in
the
second
section
of
article
iii.
and,
of
course,
as
i
think
the
court--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--i
think
in
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
the
court
would
have
a
criminal
contempt
power
that
is--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--i'm
not
sure,
quite
honestly,
that
it
should
be
characterized
as
an
inherent
power,
given
the
fact
that
since
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
there
has
always
been
a
statute
that
authorizes
federal
courts
to
impose
criminal
contempt
sanctions.
the
present
statute,
as
your
honor
knows,
is
title
xviii,
section
401.
so
it
seems
to
me
in
the
existing
environment
in
which
we
operate,
it's
more
appropriate
to
say
in
the
event
of
such
an
outburst
that
the
federal
court
could
punish
it
under
the
criminal
contempt
power
conferred
by
article
iii,
which
congress
has
implemented
under
title
xviii,
section
401.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think,
i
think
perhaps
the
best
way
to
answer
that,
if
i
can
do
it
directly,
is
that
that's
the
distinction
that
the
mine
workers
case
brought.
the
mine
workers
case
holds
that
there
is
implicit
in
this
entire
area
a
meaningful,
principal
distinction
between
vindications
of
judicial
authority
by
criminal
contempt
sanctions
and
equivalent
efforts
to
vindicate,
in
that
instance,
court
orders,
by
civil
contempt
sanctions.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
logical
and
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
when
one
undertakes
to
analyze
what's
at
stake
here.
what's
at
stake
is
the
authority
of
the
court,
the
ability
to
undertake
the
functions
consigned
to
it
by
congress
in
article
iii.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think
if
the
court
had
reached
that
conclusion
and
it
were
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
of
course,
if
mr.
willy
and
mr.
young
had
been
accorded
the
procedural
protections
that
criminal
contempt
implicates,
yes,
i
think
that
would
have
been
an
instance
in
which
criminal
contempt
sanctions
could
have
been
imposed.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think
that
case
and
such
cases
as
stoll
against
gottlieb
indicate
clearly
that
notwithstanding
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
article
iii
power,
and
the
fact
that
a
court
in
order
to
act
has
to
have
that
power
under
both
article
iii
and
ordinarily
a
statutory
grant
of
jurisdiction
from
congress,
but
nonetheless,
there
are
also
countervailing
considerations
that
sometimes
can
override
that.
and
the
example,
of
course,
of
res
judicata,
collateral
estoppel,
similar
sorts
of
administrative
devices
that
are
simply
more
important
constitutionally
than
allowing,
for
example,
absence
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
be
raised
long
after
the
judgment
is
entered
and
long
after
the
case
has
otherwise
been
closed.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think
so.
but
i'm
troubled
if
the
court
were
to
extend
that
principle
to
going
back
to
what
i
think
was
soundly
repudiated
in
catholic
conference.
and
that's
the
idea
that
there's
something
called
colorable
jurisdiction.
i
was
perviewing
the
transcript
of
the
argument
in
catholic
conference
yesterday.
i
recall
the
question
coming
up
that
the
court
was
interested
in
knowing
what
is
colorable
jurisdiction.
and
counsel
for
the
parties
were
unable
to
define
it.
then
the
question
was
asked,
what
did
the
second
circuit
mean
when
it
used
the
term
colorable
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
there
was
still
some
question.
i
think
the
court
in
catholic
conference
decisively
and
soundly
repudiated
the
idea
that
because
a
federal
court
looks
like
it
has
the
constitutional
power
to
act,
that
that's
the
functional
equivalent
of
its
having
the
constitutional
power
to
act.
i
think
we've
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
there's
an
observation
in
szabo
food,
which
was
quoted
in
cooter
&
gell,
a
very
important
case
that
i
would
like
to
turn
to
in
a
moment,
judge
easterbrook
suggested
that
if
a
district
court
elects
to
proceed
forward
with
the
case
and
to
supervise
discovery
under
rule
16
and
to
conduct
a
trial
and
to
enter
a
judgment,
and
then
discovers
at
the
end
that
the
court
doesn't
have
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it
can
nonetheless
treat
any
derelictions
by
counsel
of
the
parties
that
occurs
during
that
period
as
appropriately
sanctionable,
either
under
rule
11
or
under
an
inherent
power.
but
we
think
that's
flatly
mistaken.
i
had
thought
since
capron
against
van
noorden
that
jurisdictional
issues
have
to
be
decided
at
the
first
of
the
case,
not
at
the
end.
and
i
had
thought
that
at
least
since
turner
against
the
president
and
directors
of
the
bank
of
north
america,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1799,
that
if
it's
a
tossup,
if
the
judge
says
to
herself,
gee,
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
jurisdiction
or
not,
it's
equally
balanced,
the
presumption
is
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
unless
promptly
dismissed
or
remand
the
case.
we've
also
pointed
to
some
12
decisions--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--absolutely.
i
want
to
make
it
plain,
justice
white,
that,
the
fact
that
mr.
willy
and
his
counsel
raised
the
absence
of
constitutional
power
from
the
get-go
is
just
icing
on
the
cake
for
us.
the
result
would
be
exactly
the
same
even
if
they
had
never
raised
it,
even
if
it
had
never
been
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
even
if
it
had
not
even
been
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
the
court
had
suddenly
said,
wait
a
minute,
there's
no
article
iii
power.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
well,
oddly
enough
i
attempted
all
the
way
through
to
persuade
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
was
a
logical
and
sensible
accomodation--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--exactly.
but
i
also
want
to
state
that--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--i
didn't
do
them.
my
predecessor--
[laughter]
mr.
michael
a.
maness
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
it
seems
to
me
first
of
all
that
that
would
entail
mr.
willy
simply
refusing
to
go
forward.
what...
as
i
understand
it,
he's
supposed
to
say,
i'm
so
sure
that
the
court
lacks
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
i'm
going
to
not
do
anything,
i'm
not
going
to
prosecute
the
case,
i'm
not
going
to
attend
the
first
rule
16
scheduling
conference,
i'm
just
going
to
go
home.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
and
i
think
first
of
all,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
rhetorical
when
i
say
this,
but
i
think
it's
an
answer
to
your
question
is,
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
constitution?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitution,
both
simultaneously
extends
the
judicial
power
in
the
second
section
of
article
iii
and
limits
it.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
unworkable
and
untenable
distinction.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
first
of
all,
we've
made
it,
i
think,
clear
in
light
of
the
court's
decision
in
catholic
conference
that
interferences
with
or
obstructions
with
jurisdictional
determinations
are
as
sanctionable
as
any
other
case
in
which
the
court
does
have--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--well,
we
certainly
conceded
that
in
terms
of,
when
we
talk
of
sanctions,
this
case
involves
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
as
a
sanction.
but
we've
conceded
and
indeed
maintained
that
misconduct
by
an
attorney
or
a
litigant--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--absolutely.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
saw
that
thought
justice
white
expressed
in
the
transcript
in
the
argument
in
catholic
conference.
and
all
i
can
say
is
as
i
understand
the
constitution,
it
is
that
the
court
at
the
time
it
entertains
the
suit
from
the
very
beginning
either
has
the
jurisdiction
or
it
doesn't.
and
if
it
mistakenly
thinks
it
does
but
really
doesn't,
it
doesn't
somehow
by
virtue
of
having
made
that
mistake
empower
itself
to
act.
this
is
certainly
a
very
strange
constitutional
power
for
which
coastal
contends.
it's
one
that
can
only
be
exercised
if
the
district
court
has
booted
the
jurisdictional
determination.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
oh,
yes,
i
do.
absolutely.
if
in
fact
the
attorney's
conduct
was
criminally
contumacious--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--civil
contempt?
mr.
michael
a.
maness
oh,
no.
i
wouldn't
say
the
civil
contempt
sanctions
were
imposable
on
the
basis
of
the
mine
workers.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
criminal
contempt
could
be,
yes.
that
is
assuming
that
sanctions
were
imposed
in
accordance
with
federal
criminal
rule
41.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think
the
court
has
already
answered
that
question
in
chambers
against
nasco
last
june
when
it
quoted
hutto
against
finney
and
said
that
they're
more
equivalent
to
civil
penalties
rather
than
criminal.
and
if
they're
more
equivalent
to
criminal
penalties,
why
aren't
they
in
the
federal
criminal
rules?
why
don't
we
have
a
federal
criminal
rule
11(a)
that
authorizes
the
imposition
of
something
equivalent
to
or
functionally
equivalent
to
criminal
contempt
penalties
via
an
amended
rule
11(a)
that
would
award
attorney's
fees
perhaps
as
a
fine.
we've
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
apart
from
the
fact
that
mr.
willy
and
mr.
young
weren't
accorded
any
of
the
procedural
protections
that
a
criminal
prosecution
for
criminal
contempt
would
entail,
if
these
sanctions
are
like
criminal
contempt,
then
coastal's
counsel
should
not
be
here,
because
interested
parties
under
young
against
vuitton
can't
prosecute
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
and
indeed,
if
under
providence
journal,
mr.
beatty
couldn't
be
here,
but
we
should
have
general
starr
instead.
and
i
suggest
that
general
starr
would
not
touch
this
case
with
a
10-foot
pole.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
no.
the
lawyers
responsible
for
that
misconduct
would
be
sanctionable
by
suspension
or
disbarment.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
not
under
rule
11.
and
the
reason
i
suggest
that
that
must
be
true
and
i
say
must
as
if
it's
an
inevitable
consequence,
and
i
know
it
is
not,
is
the
alternative
argument
that
coastal
makes,
it
says
basically
that
the
courts,
apart
from
the
inherent
power
argument
has
power,
under
rule
11,
even
in
the
absence
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i've
read
catholic--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--certainly.
i
believe
that
rule
11,
as
cooter
&
gell
makes
plain,
entails
a
very
significant
obligation
for
lawyers
who
sign
pleadings.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes.
one
lawyer,
one
client.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
certainly
the
lawyer
could
have
been
suspended
or
disbarred
assuming
he--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--no,
not
in
the
absence
of
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
in
fact--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--certainly
it's
not.
but
it
also
doesn't
involve
the
adjudication
of
a
case
or
controversy
that's
not
within
the
second
section
of
article
iii,
either.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
well,
conceivably,
arguably,
it
is.
but
at
least
it's
an
alternative
remedy,
an
alternative
mechanism
that
the
court
can
use
apart
from
awarding
attorney's
fees
to
the
people
who
have
wrongly
invoked--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
and
of
course,
i
don't
represent
the
attorney.
i
represent
the
litigant
who
was
also
himself
an
attorney
and
who
presumably
the
court
of
law--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--i
don't
think
so.
i
guess
there's
an
argument
to
be
made
that
when
the
litigant
is
herself
or
himself
an
attorney
that
the
attorney/litigant
should
be
held
to
a
higher
standard.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
there
was
no
specific
finding
of
that.
there
was
no--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--i
certainly
think
that's
true.
in
fact,
so
implicit
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
used
a
technique
in
their
order
and
opinion
of
saying
plaintiff
or
willy
when
they
actually
were
referring
to
actions
that
had
occurred
and
the
records
revealed
were
undertaken
by
mr.
young,
the
attorney.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
exactly.
but
of
course,
the
whole
point
of
article
iii
is
to
restrain
excessive
uses
of
judicial
power.
when
the
constitution
limits
the
judiciary
as
it
does
the
political
branches--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--i
think
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
that,
that
that
argument
and
that
reasoning
could,
in
fact,
be
used
in
this
case
if
the
court
were
prepared
to
say
that
exigency
and
necessity
are
a
substitute
for
the
article
iii
judicial
power.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
well,
i
think
you,
and
i
may
be
mistaken
here,
i
think
the
court
has
said
in
the
mine
workers
case
that
the
court
in
that
case
did
have
the
article
iii
judicial
powers,
a
case
to
which
the
united
states
was
a
party,
a
case
in
which
the
court
was
entertaining
a
federal
question,
a
very
real
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
has
the
authority
to
impose
a
specific
remedy,
the
injunction.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
conceded,
your
honor,
that
that
conceivably
if
the
evidence
were
sufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
innocence,
for
example,
that
mr.
willy
would
have
enjoyed
had
he
known
that
he
was
going
to
be
accused
of
criminal--
mr.
michael
a.
maness
--because
at
least,
since
what,
michaelson
and
i
suspect
probably
in
a
number
of
other
criminal
contempt
proceedings,
the
court
has
said
that
criminal
contempt,
even
if
it
arises
in
a
civil
lawsuit,
is
a
separate
case.
it's
a
different
proceeding.
it's
designed
not
to
adjudicate
the
rights
of
the
parties,
but
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
certainly.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
well,
justice
souter,
if
the
court
were
to
accept
that
reason,
it
would
essentially
be
saying
that
even
in
the
absence
of
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
a
united
states
district
court
that
mistakenly
undertakes
to
hear
and
decide
a
case
over
which
it
lacks
the
judicial
power
nonetheless
has
a
form
of
judicial
power.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes.
but
the
answer,
i
think,
is
the
parties
should
not
before
the
court
if
it
lacks
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
they
should
be
dismissed
or
remanded.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes,
i'm
asking
the
court
to
hold
district
judges
as
accountable
as
we
are
under
rule
11.
absolutely.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
yes,
absolutely,
under
insurance
corporation
of
ireland.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
think
that
then
would
presumably
implicate
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
would
be
in
our
case
then.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
insurance
corporation
of
ireland
draws
a
very
clear
line
between
personal
jurisdiction
that
can
be,
for
example,
established
by
rule
37
sanction
and
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
before
i
reserve,
with
the
court's
permission,
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
cooter
&
gell,
which
is
the
linchpin
of
coastal's
arguments,
really
doesn't
control
this
case.
it's
not
a
constitutional
decision.
the
court
wasn't
confronted
with
an
article
iii
issue
in
that
case.
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
the
court
in
cooter
&
gell
specifically
adverted
to
the
district
court's
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
the
source
of
its
authority,
both
for
considering
the
merits
of
the
case
and
for
imposing
sanctions.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
reserve
just
a
few
moments.
mr.
michael
a.
maness
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
stated
in
catholic
conference
that
a
court,
federal
district
court's
subpoena
power
under
federal
civil
rule
45
cannot
be
greater
than
its
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
suggest
exactly
the
same
principle
compels
the
holding
that
a
court's
sanction
power
under
rule
11
cannot
be
greater
than
its
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
would
have
thought
at
least
since
sibbach
against
wilson
&
co.
and
in
light
of
the
express
provisions
of
federal
rule
82,
that
this
isn't
a
rule
11
case
because
rule
11
can't
enlarge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court.
and
we're
talking
here
about
jurisdiction
in
a
most
fundamental
sense,
the
power
of
a
court
to
do
something.
another
distinction,
and
i
think
it's
crucial
in
light
of
the
discussions
we've
had
this
morning
is
that
in
catholic
conference
the
civil
contempt
sanctions
were
imposed
against
a
nonparty
and
therefore
were
immediately
appealable.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
we
were
stuck
to
the
fly
paper.
and
conceivably,
if
the
district
court
had
not
granted
coastal's
motion
to
dismiss,
we
might
have
been
in
the
federal
district
court
much
longer
than
we
were.
finally,
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
with
this
hypothetical.
what
makes
coastal's
argument
somewhat
compelling
is
the
assumption,
and
i
think
it's
an
appropriate
assumption,
that
the
district
court
acted
in
good
faith.
but
suppose
the
district
court
acted
in
bad
faith,
suppose
from
the
beginning
it
said,
look,
i
realize
i
don't
have
article
iii
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
i've
got
to
decide
this
case
anyway
since
it's
very
important
question
of
state
law.
and
if
i
leave
it
to
the
state
courts,
they're
probably
going
to
botch
it.
is
it
conceivably
arguable
then
if
the
district
court
proceeds
to
hear
and
preside
the
case
over
a
period
of
years
that
the
court
could
then
attempt
to
award
attorney's
fees
to
the
party
wrongly
moving
the
case?
and
if
the
court
is
going
to
draw
a
distinction
between
good
faith
exercises
of
colorable
article
iii
power
and
bad
faith
exercises,
then
it's
right
back
where
it
was
at
catholic
conference.
and
seven
members
of
the
court,
seven
members
of
the
present
court,
rejected
that
argument
fairly
conclusively
and
fairly
persuasively.
we
think
the
federal
judicial
power
under
article
iii
doesn't
depend
on
subjective
mental
processes
of
judges
or
litigants.
it
depends
upon
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
sanctions
order
in
this
case
violated
the
second
section
of
article
iii
and
should
be
reversed.
