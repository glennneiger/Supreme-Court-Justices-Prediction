mr.
michael
l.
beatty
beatty.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
as
opposing
counsel
has
already
acknowledged,
there
are
two
bases
upon
which
we
believe
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
inherent
power
and
manifestations
of
that
inherent
power
represent
both
the
inherent
power
to
police
proceedings
as
well
as
the
inherent
power
to
determine
jurisdiction.
as
a
separate
and
independent
basis,
however,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
necessary
and
proper
cause
through
which
the
rules
enabling
act
was
passed
and
rule
11
was
promulgated
also
provides
a
sufficient
constitutional
basis
which
is
the
question
presented.
that
is
the
constitutional
basis
for
rule
11
sanctions
in
this
case.
now,
opposing
counsel
is
willing
to
concede
that
inherent
power
certainly
exists.
inherent
power
exists
outside
of
article
iii,
section
2
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
once
this
concession
is
made,
it
becomes
extremely
difficult,
indeed,
i
would
suggest
impossible,
to
reconcile
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
what
we
had
in
catholic
conference
was
a
situation
in
which
the
bishops
did
exactly
what
mr.
willy
could
have
done.
the
bishops
had
a
situation
where
they
were
held
in
civil
contempt.
they
then
sought
an
immediate
interlocutory
appeal.
and
they
said,
we
are
not
going
to
participate
in
this
proceeding
any
longer
because
we
believe
that
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction
in
the
underlying
case,
and
as
a
result
we
must
respectfully
decline
to
tender
any
documents
or
to
honor
the
subpoena.
as
a
result,
that
case
went
up.
justice
stevens
has
already
pointed
out
if
the
catholic
bishops'
attorneys
had
said
we
believe
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
but
we
want
to
brief
the
issue
on
the
merits,
we
would
like
to
address
the
merits
of
this
case
and
in
the
context
of
that,
what
they
did
was
they
cited
misleading
citations,
rules
of
evidence
that
didn't
exist,
tendered
documents
to
the
court
with
affidavits
that
were
wholly
inadequate
to
establish
them,
1,200
pages,
and
said,
oh,
and
read
this
by
the
way,
then
i
submit
that
catholic
conference
would
say,
first
of
all
that
this
was
a
civil
contempt
matter
and
what
happens
is
there's
no
jurisdiction,
but
the
court
will
retain
jurisdiction
on
the
rule
11
issue
and
will
sanction
and
should
sanction
attorneys
when
their
misbehavior
reaches
a--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--certainly.
i
think,
i
was
trying,
i'm
trying
to
go
through
all
the
hypotheticals
that
i
could
imagine
in
my
mind.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
well,
the
short
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
he
can
behave.
that
is
what--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--i'm
sorry,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
fact
situation.
if
what
happened
is
there
was
a
removal
and
he
believed
that
there
was
not
appropriate
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
case--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--and
he
simply
refused
to
respond,
then
what
would
happen
is
a
judgment
would
be
entered
against
him
and
he
would
then
have
the
opportunity
to
appeal
the
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
certainly
he
litigates
the
jurisdictional
issue
because
it's
even
conceded
by
petitioner
that
the
federal
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction.
he
can't
escape
that
fact.
and
he
would
willingly
submit
to
that.
he
would
also
say,
i
would
behave
in
that
circumstance.
so
he
has
a
choice.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
certainly,
your
honor.
absolutely,
he
did.
what
happened,
what
happened
after
the
case,
after
the
motion
to
remand
was
denied,
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
and
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
was
filed
by
willy,
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
merits.
what
then
happened
was
misleading
citations
which
were
discussed
in
the
brief
as
though
the
omitted
portion
was
not
omitted,
what
happened
was
citations
to
rules
of
evidence
that
did
not
exist,
all
of
those
happened
in
the
context
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
no.
he
did
have,
again,
he
did
have
that
one
other
alternative.
it's
a
dichotomy,
i
agree.
one
is
that
he
can
say,
i'll
take
a
judgment
against
me
and
appeal
jurisdiction.
the
other
thing
he
could
do
is
say
i
will
litigate
the
merits
and
i'll
behave.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
i
hope
and
i
would
submit
that
that's
not
a
hard,
that
shouldn't
be
that
difficult
a
choice
for
a
litigant
to
take.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
yes.
i
would
concur.
and
as
a
result
what
happens
is
once
we
begin
to
say
that
there
is
inherent
power
both
to
determine
jurisdiction
and
inherent
power
that
exists
within
the
court
to
police
its
own
proceedings,
then
there
must
be
the
ability
to
sanction
someone
who
does
the
kind
of
activity
which
is
at
stake
in
this
particular
case.
really,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
only
thing
that
petitioner
can
raise
is
the
fact
that
somehow
attorney's
fees
might
not
be
applicable.
and
yet
that
argument
has
been
rejected.
the
court
has
held
that
attorney's
fees
certainly
can
be
imposed
either
under
rule
11
or
under
the
court's
inherent
power.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
if
i
might,
your
honor,
address
both
that
issue
of
hutto
v.
finney
as
well
as
the
issue
of
attorney
fee
shifting.
it
was
pointed
out
both
in
the
majority
by
justice
white
that
the
reason
that
fee
shifting
is
of
concern
is
because
of
concern
for
the
american
rule.
now
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
constitutional
impediment,
that
is,
a
court
could
take,
act
further.
the
court
has
just
elected
to
stop
short
of
that
and
say,
on
fee
shifting
we're
going
to
honor
what
we
believe,
what
justice
scalia
referred
to
in
his
dissent
as
deeply
rooted
history
and
congressional
policy.
and
so
for
that
reason,
there's
a
slight
rub,
but
it's
not
a
constitutional
rub
at
the
attorney's
fee
level.
and
then
with
regard
to
hutto
v.
finney,
if
you
look
at
that,
recall
that
that
case
was
the
prison
case
dealing
with
a
situation
in
arkansas
in
which
arkansas
had
repeatedly
been
told,
please
take
action.
it
was
more
than
an
exhortation
of
please,
it
was
a
take
action.
and
that
that
had
not
been
done
in
order
to
clarify,
in
order
to
remedy
the
problems
in
their
prison
system.
and
therefore,
the
court
imposed
a
$
20,
000
attorney's
fee
sanctions,
but
said
in
that
case
we
hope
that
will
incline
them
to
behave
in
the
future
and
hope
that
they...
and
that
was
civil
contempt.
here,
and
i
would
refer
to
your
decisions
over
and
over
in
business
guides
as
well
as
your
decision
in
cooter
&
gell.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
i
don't
raise
it
for
that
position.
i
raise
it
for
the
position
that
it
was
repeatedly
said
rule
11
sanctions
are
designed
to
punish.
rule
11
sanctions
are
designed
to
deter
misconduct.
rule
11
sanctions
are
designed
to
curb
abuses
of
the
judicial
process.
the
language
that's
used.
and
therefore,
in
cooter
&
gell
you
can
get
the
results
where
even
though
the
case
was
dismissed
and
no
longer
present
before
the
court,
the
court
could
say,
i
nonetheless
wish
to
sanction
this
conduct
because
that's
not
the
kind
of
behavior
we
wish
to
condone,
just
as
in
this
case
either
through
the
inherent
power
or
through
the
use
of
rule
11
sanctions,
the
court
should
be
able
to
say
exactly
the
same
thing.
you
may
certainly
contest
jurisdiction
if
you
wish.
you
may
be
here
and
contest
the
merits
if
you
wish
to
do
that.
but
the
one
thing
the
court
has
a
right
to
demand
of
all
litigants
is
that
they
follow
the
rules.
if
i
might,
simply
because
it
would
appear
that
from
an
attorney's
fees
standpoint,
there
certainly
is
not
a
problem,
a
constitutional
limitation,
i
would
submit
also
that
there
is
not
a
problem
with
regard
to
the
inherent
power
operating
outside
of
article
iii,
section
2.
gompers
is
an
example
of
that
situation,
albeit
gompers
was
a
situation
in
which
criminal
contempt
was
ultimately
used
as
the
sanction.
in
gompers
v.
buck's
stove,
what
happened
was
after
the
case
had
been
litigated
but
was
on
appeal,
there
was
a
settlement.
as
a
result,
the
court
noted
in
its
last
paragraph
this
case
is
now
moot,
but,
said,
we
retained
jurisdiction
in
order
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
a
contempt
which
should
be
punished.
and
it's
because
of
that,
the
court's
ability
to
go
back
and
look
and
punish
activities
which
does
take
place
within
the
court's
proper
and
justiciable
sphere.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
but...
i
understand
that.
rule
11
is
not,
is
more
like.
and
i
think
that's
the
best
way
to
describe
it.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
it's
more
like
criminal.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
it
is,
in
rule
11,
in
this
situation,
it
is
paid
to
the
opposite
party.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
in
a
criminal
contempt
situation
it
might
be,
but
normally
is
not
done.
and
certainly
there
are
additional
constitutional
safeguards.
however,
in
the
inherent,
in
the
use
of
the
inherent
power
what
has
happened,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
if
i
might
justice
white,
when
he
refers
in
chambers
v.
nasco
to
the
parties
and
to
hutto,
he
says
the
imposition
of
sanctions
in
this
instance
transcends
a
court's
equitable
power
concerning
relations
between
the
parties
and
reaches
the
court's
inherent
power
to
police
itself,
thus
serving
the
dual
purpose
of
vindicating
judicial
authority
without
resort
to
the
more
drastic
sanctions
available
for
contempt
of
court
and
making
the
prevailing
party
whole
for
expenses
caused
by
his
opponent's
obstinacy.
that's
the
inherent
power
as
noted
in
the
majority
opinion,
gave
the
court
the
opportunity
to
do
something
less
than
criminal
contempt.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
the
court
has
not
dealt
with
this
particular
situation
before,
inherent
power
in
this
particular
situation
where
subsequently--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
oh,
but
no--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--no.
i
cannot
cite
you--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--yes,
but
the
argument
that
was
raised
was
a
rule
11
case
because
it
was,
arkansas
was
arguing
that
there
couldn't
be
an
imposition
of
attorney's
fees
against
them
because
it
would
interfere
with
their
position--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--i
apologize.
that's
the
reason
this
case
is
here.
but
once
you
say
that
the
court
has
this
inherent
power
to
govern
proceedings...
let
me,
for
example,
turn
to
jurisdiction
to
determine
jurisdiction.
if
what
happens
is,
let's
assume
just
by
way
of
assumption
that
what
happens
is
that
you
have
an
environmental
case
in
which
a
standing
issue
is
raised
regarding
someone
in
sri
lanka.
it
could
be
entirely
possible
that
that
case
could
be
litigated
a
significant
way
down
the
road
without
having
a
jurisdictional
determination
made.
indeed,
it
could
be
possible
that
the
jurisdictional
circumstance
could
change.
for
example,
the
litigant
could
die.
the
case
could
thereby
become
moot.
we
couldn't
even
solve
the
problem
by
overruling
catland
v.
united
states
in
saying
before
anything
else
will
happen,
before
anything
else
will
happen,
we
must
make
certain
that
we
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
you
take
the
case
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
and
then
you
would
say
you
have
jurisdiction,
go
back
to
the
district
court.
it
can
be
raised
at
any
time.
it
may
well
happen
that
circumstances
change
such
that
all
of
a
sudden
the
court
is
divested
of
jurisdiction.
and
what
the
argument
of
petitioner
seems
to
suggest
is
that
during
that
entire
preceding
period
there
would
be
no
opportunity
to
impose
rule
11
sanctions
on
a
litigant
in
a
case.
and
that's
what's
so
troublesome.
i
come
here--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--the
importance
of
the
case
i
don't
underestimate.
however,
it's
important
to
note,
remember
that
the
1983
amendment
indicated
that
what
happened
was
that
they
needed
to
change
the
sanctions
in
order,
for
example,
to
establish
an
objective
test
as
opposed
to
a
subjective
test.
the
advisor
said,
we
need
to
be
able
to
get
at
this
conduct.
i
come
to
you
as
a
person
who
practices
primarily
in
front
of
the
district
courts.
we
all
know
the
problems
that
are
existing
down
there.
i
would
suggest
that
even
though
we
may
have
gotten
along
well
for
200
years,
primarily
we've
gotten
along
well
for
200
years
because
people
have
obeyed
the
rules
and
do
believe
that
rule
11
would
apply.
that's
what
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts
have
always
suggested
is
that
the
rules
would
apply.
certainly,
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
applied
and
no
one
argues
with
it.
the
rules
apply
in
every
case.
and
this
is
the
judicial
standard
that
has
always
been
used,
utilized,
which
if
you
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
rule,
and
no
one
questions
that
it
applies
in
all
civil
cases,
it
applies
by
rule
81(c)
in
all
cases
which
are
removed.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
of
course,
my
suggestion
with
regard
to
my
client
is
that,
and
i've
had,
we've
had
a
couple
of
cases
come
up
like
this.
you
get
up
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
supreme
court
makes
a
decision
like
merrell-dow
and
all
of
a
sudden
everybody
says,
whoops,
let's
go
back
and
look
at
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
or
for
example--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--well,
this
is
this
case.
this
is
what
happened
on
the
jurisdiction
issue.
it's
the
merrell-dow
which
says
positively,
ultimately
if
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
it's
also
true
of
carden
v.
arkoma
associates.
and
neither
things
were
all
of
a
sudden,
here,
we're
questioning
whether
or
not
limited
partnerships
can
meet
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
parties
litigate
and
go
through
the
process
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
find
out
that
what
they
were
doing
was
not
proper.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
litigants
shouldn't
behave
once
they're
in
front
of
a
courtroom
and
in
the
courtroom,
once
these
issues
have
been
decided
and
can
properly
be
brought
up
on
appeal.
all
we're
asking
is
that
rule
11
sanctions
be
available
so
that
people
will
behave.
as
a
constitutional
matter--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--well,
but,
my
argument,
of
course,
would
be
that
there
is,
that
there
is
the
equivalent
of
a
statute
on
that.
what
we
have
is,
we
have
the
necessary
and
proper
cause
as
the
constitutional
issue.
what
we
secondly
have
is
we
have
the
rules
enabling
act.
and
certainly
27(b)(2)(b)
says
it
should
not
abridge,
enlarge,
or
modify
substantive
rights.
but
here,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
mr.
willy's
substantive
rights
are
absolutely
intact.
his
case
on
the
merits
proceeds
in
the
district
court
in
the
state
of
texas
today.
it
has
not
been
affected
one
iota,
unlike
many
of
the
other
cases
in
which
we're
looking
at
procedural
rules
and
we're
asking
about
the
impact
on
a
litigant
and
he
may
well
lose
his
case
on
the
merits
as
a
result
of
the
impact
of
the
federal
rule.
here
there
has
been
no
impact
whatsoever.
and
again,
that
would
point
out
the
point
that,
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
issue
which
is
it
would
seem
that
either
from
the
standpoint
of
separation
of
powers
or
from
the
standpoint
of
federalism,
that
there's
not
a
competing
interest
on
the
other
side.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
no,
your
honor,
again,
and
frankly,
because
i
accept
the
argument
that
you
have,
or
the
distinguishing
factor
that
you
already
made,
which
is
that
that
was
a
civil
contempt
case
by
a
nonparty
who
all
of
a
sudden,
who
had
that
right,
that
immediate
right
of
an
interlocutory
appeal.
he
was
able
to
bring
that
up.
here
what
we
have
is
we
have
the
court
consistently
said
we
don't
want
to
have
piecemeal
litigation.
catland
v.
united
states
says
raise
your
jurisdictional
issue,
let's
go
through
and
litigate
the
merits
and
take
it
on
up.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--well,
except,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
you
say
that
the
rules,
the
rules
themselves,
recognize
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
to
its
inherent
power.
so
what
happens,
all
that
does,
all
that
does
is
that
just
circles
that.
if
what
happens
is
the
rules
apply
where
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
and
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
everywhere
under
article
iii,
section
2.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
but,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
--except,
your
honor,
the
thing
that
is
important
to
note
there
is
the
question
presented
to
the
court
is
a
constitutional
one
and
if
the
issue
is
does
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
support
the
legislature
that
the
congress,
in
this
instant,
is
passing
legislation
which
would
get
at
this
type
of
behavior.
and
the
answer
is
yes.
and
that's
the
reason
i
say
there
are
two
separate...
and
a
constitutional
basis
for
this.
mr.
michael
l.
beatty
no,
your
honor.
let
me
finally
conclude
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
one
ultimately
has
to
come
out
with,
yes,
there
is
inherent
power,
yes,
that
inherent
power
may
well
be
shaped,
not
only
by
congress,
but
the
inherent
power
is
reserved
to
the
courts
and
the
court
could
use
that
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic,
either
of
those
constitutionally
to
support
the
sanctions
of
rule
11
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
