next
in
no.
90-1150,
donald
j.
willy
v.
coastal
corporation.
mr.
maness,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
just
refer,
mr.
maness,
to
one
of
our
cases
in
saying
that
it
was
controlled
by
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
was
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
was...
do
you
have
a
citation
for
that
or
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
that's
fine.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me,
mr.
maness,
your
opponent
cites
the
case
of
chicot
county
valley
drainage
district,
the
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes,
in
which
this
court
held
that
even
though
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction
was
unconstitutional,
nonetheless
a
lot
of
consequences
flowed
from
something
having
been
acted
on
under
that
grant.
what's
your...
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
isn't
just
a
totally
clear
line
between
black
and
white.
there
has
to
be
some
evaluation
of
for
what
the
claim
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
maness.
mr.
beatty.
is
it
beatty
or
beatty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beatty.
mr.
maness,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maness.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
90-1150,
willy
against
coastal
corporation.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner,
willy,
sued
respondent,
coastal
corporation,
in
state
court.
the
coastal
corporation
removed
the
case
to
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
eventually
dismissed
petitioner's
action
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
at
the
time
of
the
dismissal,
however,
it
also
imposed
sanctions
for
improper
behavior
by
the
petitioner
pursuant
to
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
the
district
court
had
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
and
so
ordered
the
district
court
to
vacate
its
order
dismissing
the
case
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
once
it
had
originally
come.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
order
of
sanctions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
several
cases
dating
back
half
a
century,
we
have
held
that
actions
taken
by
a
court
bind
the
parties
even
though
it
is
later
determined
that
the
court
did
not
have
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
the
district
court's
proper
interest
in
having
its
rules
of
procedure
obey
it
did
not
disappear
with
the
subsequent
determination
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction.
its
action
was
collateral
to
the
merits
of
the
case
and
so
raises
no
question
of
exceeding
the
limits
imposed
on
federal
jurisdiction
by
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
