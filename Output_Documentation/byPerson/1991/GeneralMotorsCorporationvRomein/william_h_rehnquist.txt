chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-1390,
general
motors
corporation
v.
evert
romein.
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
are
the
respondents
in
this
case
members
of
a
class?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
did
each
of
these
people
go
to
work
for
general
motors
and
for
ford?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
a
minimum
wage
statute,
that
that's
contractual
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
all
this
government
regulation
of
conditions
of
employment
become
contractual
really--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
sachs,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
immediate
revulsion
on
the
part
of
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sachs,
the
petitioner
in
his
argument
said
he
thought
his
strongest
case
was
the
forbes
case,
and
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
case
is
mentioned
three
times.
you
do
not
mention
it
at
all
in
your
brief.
do
you
have
any
response
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
an
act
of
congress,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
never
came
to
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
equating
the
contract
clause
with
due
process--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--when
you
said
there
was
minimum
scrutiny,
are
you
talking
about
the
due
process
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
the
contract
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
spannaus
was
a
contract
clause
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
sachs,
isn't
the
chambers
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
a
pretty
fair
characterization
of
what
they
had
a
legitimate
right
to
expect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
opinion
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state
saying
what
the
legislature
meant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
a
long
way
around
of
saying,
they
construed
the
law
and...
as
to
what
the
law
meant
and
they
are
the
final
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
then
about
another
law,
not
the
law
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
construed
in
chambers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
quite
a
different
point
than
saying
ford
and
gm
had
no
expectations
whatever
based
on
the
1982
statute,
because
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
wouldn't
have
construed
that
statuted;
it
conformed
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sachs.
mr.
geller,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
