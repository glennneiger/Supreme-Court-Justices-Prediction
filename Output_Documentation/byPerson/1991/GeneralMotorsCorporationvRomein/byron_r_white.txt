were
they
represented
by
a
union?
was
there
a
collective
bargaining
contract--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
how
could
it
have
been
at
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
suppose
it
probably
provided
that
you
couldn't
be
fired
except
for
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suppose
that
is
an
at-will
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
say
it's
an
at-will
contract
if
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you...
supposing
in
'87
they
just
made
the
new
law
prospective...
changed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
just
the...
going
back
to
'81?
justice

white
just
going
back
to
'81?
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
geller,
didn't
the
'81
statute
increase...
although
it
let
the
pension
payments
be
offset
against
the
workmen's
compensation,
didn't
the
level
of
workmen
compensation
payments
go
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
for
people
who
were
hurt
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that...
you
say
that
the
workmen's
compensation
payments
that
were
due
to...
after
1981,
that
were
due
to
employees
who
were
hurt
before
were
the
same
as
the
workmen's
compensation
payments
for
employees
who
were
hurt
after
1981?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
the
workmen
compensation
payments
were
at
the
same
level
for
both
classes
of
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
those
hurt
before
1981?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
people
who
were
complaining
were
already
retired
and
not
employees
any
longer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
union
probably
didn't
have
any
interest
in
what
gm
did
to
these
former
retirees.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
must
not
have
been
a
bargainable
issue.
