mr.
geller,
what
is
the
contract
exactly
that
you
say
was
impaired?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
look
back
at
the
original
employment
contract
with
people
who
were
hired
before
1981
who
were
injured
and
put
on
disability
before
then,
i
assume
under
the
terms
of
the
original
program,
there
would
be
no
coordination
of
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
original
understanding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
can
that
contract
be
impaired?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
you
could
certainly
argue
that
the
contract
was
that
of
the
original
understanding
between
the
employer
and
the
employees,
that
they'd
get
what
the
law
provided
when
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
they
were
disabled
and
started
receiving
the
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
purposes
of
a
contract
clause
assertion,
is
it
purely
a
matter
of
state
law
or
is
there
a
federal
law
component
to
what
a
contract
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
you
take
the
position
that
these
workmen'
comp
benefits
are
in
effect
contractual?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
the
state
court
found
they
were
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--part
of
the
contract,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
think
that's
what
they
meant,
that
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law,
that
isn't
part
of
the
contract.
now
you
want
us
to
find
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
the
legislature
passed
resolutions
earlier
saying
they
had
never
intended
the
result
that
the
supreme
court
of
that
state--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
is
general
motors
corporation
versus
romein
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
in
1987,
the
michigan
legislature
enacted
a
statute
that
had
the
effect
of
requiring
the
petitioners,
general
motors
corporation
and
ford
motor
company,
to
repay
workers'
compensation
benefits
they
had
withheld
in
reliance
on
a
1981
workers'
compensation
statute.
the
petitioners
brought
suit
alleging
that
the
retroactive
impact
of
the
1987
statute
violated
the
contract
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
michigan
supreme
court
upheld
the
1987
statue
against
these
challenges
on
the
ground
that
the
employers
had
no
vested
contractual
rights
in
making
payments
in
accordance
with
the
1981
statute
that
would
require
invoking
the
contract
clause,
and
also
on
the
ground
that
the
retroactive
provisions
did
not
violate
the
due
process
clause
because
they
furthered
a
rational
legislative
purpose.
the
petitioners
were
ordered
to
refund
nearly
$25
million
to
disabled
employees.
we
hold
there
was
no
contractual
term
between
the
employers
and
their
employees
that
allowed
the
employers
to
rely
on
the
finality
of
payments
made
pursuant
to
the
1981
statute.
because
there
was
no
contract,
the
contracts
clause
does
not
apply.
we
also
hold
that
the
retroactive
provisions
of
the
1987
statute
was
rationally
related
to
legitimate
legislative
purposes
because
they
preserve
the
compromise
struck
by
the
1981
workers'
compensation
reforms
in
michigan,
and
because
they
equalize
the
payments
made
by
all
employers
during
the
time
when
the
interpretation
of
the
1981
statute
was
in
dispute.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
below.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
