justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
essence
of
the
contractual
provision
that
you
are
arguing
here
is
that
the
employers
are
liable
to
pay
what's
required
for
that
pay
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
contract
is
based
on
long
tradition
and
usage
in
michigan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
had
been
in
michigan
some
retroactive
adjustments
of
workers'
compensation
benefits
over
very
minor
manners...
matters
and
reaching
back
just
one
legislative
session,
or
is
that
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
had
always
been
prospective?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
were
upward
adjustments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
were
upward
adjustments,
the
primary
retroactivity
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
upward
for
how
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me,
retroactive
for
how
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
any
or
all
of
those
statutes
you
mentioned
have
the
effect
of
reopening
past
pay
periods?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
require
a
retroactive
calculation
and
payment
for
past
months?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
do
you
say
there
was
primary
retroactivity
in
the
sense
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
describe
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
didn't
require
any
increased
payments
on
the
part
of
the
employer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
would
be
simply
like
waiving
a
statute
of
limitations,
which
we
have
held
is
permissible.
