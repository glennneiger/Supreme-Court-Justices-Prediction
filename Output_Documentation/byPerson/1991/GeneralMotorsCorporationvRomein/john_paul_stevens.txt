john
paul

mr.
geller,
may
i
ask,
supposing
in
1985
that
the
chambers
case
had
been
decided
the
other
way,
then
the
company
would
have
had
to
come
up
with
the
past-due
money,
but
that
would
have
been
because
the
effective
date--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--now,
what
if
the
legislature,
while
the
case
was
pending,
had
passed
this
very
same
statute
and
said,
we
don't
want
the
supreme
court
to
make
a
mistake,
so
we
will
say
this
is
what
we
meant
back
in
1981
or
whatever
it
was.
would
you
have
the
same
attack
on
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
reliance
interest.
you
withheld
the
money
in
both
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
challenging
not
just
payments
since
1985--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
all
the
way
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
analytically
how
it
would
be
any
different
if
the
statute
had
been
passed
just
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
had
acted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
was
some
prompt
reaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
some
prompt
reaction
to
the
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
geller,
under
this
argument
wouldn't
the
1981
act
have
been
retroactive
the
way
you
are
arguing
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
had
adjusted
rights
that
had
accrued
for
already
retired
employees,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
a
lesser
amount
than
it
had
been
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
this
is...
workmen's
compensation
is
a
little
different
because
you
got
a
private...
anyway,
supposing
they
added
a
new
kind
of
injury
they
hadn't
included
and
said
that
we've
just
learned
that
there
are
a
lot
of
injured
former
employees
of
the
automobile
companies
out
there
who
were
injured
by
a
certain
kind
of
exposure
to
something
in
the
plant
and
we
therefore
want
to
retroactively
have
compensation
for
them.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
pretty
close
to
the
coal
miners'
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
probably
because
it
wouldn't
have
taken
care
of
the
people
from
'81
to
'82,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller
says
they
are
not
retroactive
in
the
same
sense
as
these.
