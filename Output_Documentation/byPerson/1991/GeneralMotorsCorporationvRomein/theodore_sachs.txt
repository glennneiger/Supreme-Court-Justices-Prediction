mr.
theodore
sachs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
appeal
to
the
contract
clause
is
an
extraordinary
one,
particularly
in
that
it
does
not
avail
the
petitioners
at
all,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
get
the
facts
and
history
straight.
mr.
romein
and
mr.
gonzalez,
like
other
employees
or
former
employees
similarly
situated,
had
worked
for
decades
for
these
employers.
during
the
entire
time
of
their
employment
and
other
similarly
situated
employees
the
michigan
workers'
compensation
statute
forbade,
expressly
prohibited
any
kinds
of
setoffs
or
coordination,
as
it
is
currently
called.
these
respondents,
mr.
romein
and
mr.
gonzalez,
worked
through
their
course
of
employment
until
mr.
romein
was
disabled
in
1977
in
serious
injuries.
i
misspoke
myself,
mr.
romein.
mr.
gonzalez
was
disabled
from
silicosis
in
1981.
through
all
of
these
decades
until
the
moment
they
were
injured
and
became
disabled
michigan
law
expressly
prohibited
any
kind
of
setoff
or
coordination.
during
this
time,
moreover,
contrary
to
petitioners'
statements,
there
was
not
a
statement
under
michigan
law
that
there
was
a
contract
of
any
variety.
there
are
several
michigan
cases,
they
are
cited
in
our
brief,
in
which
the
court
said
precisely
the
opposite.
and
indeed,
ironically,
when
general
motors
argued
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
the
chambers
case,
it
made
precisely
the
argument
that
michigan
did
not
respect
workers'
compensation
as
an
aspect
of
contract.
and
we
have
appended
the
general
motors'
brief
in
the
chambers
case
as
appendix
a
to
our
own
brief
here,
showing
that
general
motors's
position
at
that
time
was
diametrically
opposite
to
the
position
asserted
here.
the
michigan
supreme
court
had
never...
i'm
about
to
overstate
it.
prior
to
1943
the
michigan
statute
was
elective.
after
that
time
it
was
compulsory
and
then
in
the
recent
cases
of
the
court,
the
court
recognized
that
it
was
compulsory.
employers
had
no
options
to
modify
this
law
at
all.
they
could
not
agree
to
any
changes.
they
could
not
vary
anything.
there
was
no
right
of
contract.
there
was
no
mutual
assent.
there
was
no
knowledge
required.
and
with
respect
to
the
characterization
by
the
way
that
this
was
at-ill
contract
insofar
as
these
employees
are
concerned,
that
was,
of
course,
not
the
case.
these
employees
were
members
of
the
uaw
bargaining
unit--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor,
because
what--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
with
all
due
respect
to
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--it
was
not
a
bargainable
issue,
and
under
the
law
of
this
court
it
could
not
have
been
a
bargainable
issue
because
once
these
employees
retired,
they
ceased
to
be
employees
by
definition.
and
accordingly
when
the
1981
amendments
occurred,
these
were
no
longer
employees
who
would
have
had
any
employment
contract
into
which
to
incorporated
the
workers'
compensation,
quotes,
"contract".
so
the
argument
is
extremely
paradoxical.
the
claim
is
made
that
we
have
a
contract.
what's
the
contract?
well,
the
contract
you
are
told
is
anything
the
legislature
says
in
the
future.
now,
that's
a--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
understand
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
sachs
well,
justice
scalia,
of
course,
i
don't
accept
it,
and
of
course
there
is
nothing
in
the
michigan
case
law
or
the
michigan
statute
which
supports
any
such
interpretation.
the
courts...
the
michigan
court
has
rejected
generally
the
notion
that
there
is
any
kind
of
contract.
it
certainly
therefore
did
not
upset...
accept
a
subset,
a
promise
where
there
is
no
promise
at
all
that
employers
will
be
obligated
to
accept
anything
that
comes
down
the
pike
in
the
future.
that's
the
last
thing
in
the
world
the
legislature
would
have
intended
or
that
employers
would
have
been
agreeable
to.
so
that
when
in
1981
the,
quotes,
"coordination"
was
agreed
to
as
a
part
of
a
general
accommodation
of
values
by
the
legislature
and
policy
judgments
are
made
on
the
one
hand
to
increase
workers'
compensation
benefits
prospectively,
in
part
to
be
financed
through
the
resources
of
the
coordination,
but
dealing
only
with
future
injuries,
that
is
a
determination
made
in
the
legitimate
policy
judgment
of
the
michigan
legislature,
not
as
a
matter
of
contract,
but
obviously
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers
regulating
the
workplace
in
this
important
area.
this
court
recognized
in
1917
that
this
was
the
legitimate
exercise
of
police
powers
of
the
state
to
protect
the
serious
interests
that
are
involved.
mr.
theodore
sachs
the
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
would
depend
upon
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
under
due
process
scrutiny--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--not
under
contract
scrutiny.
and
the
issue
there
for
example,
to
expand
on--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--yes,
i
will.
if--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
hope
to,
your
honor.
what
happened
when
the
judgments
and
accommodations
were
made
in
1980
and
1981,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
counsel,
was
not
that
there
was
any
fat
increase
of
benefits
for
the
workers
who
were
already
retired.
there
was
a
nominal
so-called
supplemental
increase,
payable
by
the
state,
not
by
employers,
which
by
case
law
has
been
generally
inapplicable
to
virtually
everybody
who
might
otherwise
be
affected
and
is
insignificant
in
its
application.
but
let's
take
the
history
a
little
further
so
we
get
this
factual
context
straight.
what
happened
was
in
1982,
when
general
motors
and
ford,
apparently
alone,
took
on
this
aggressive
posture
of
trying
to
interpret
the
statutory
amendments
as
other
employers
were
not
doing,
including
their
competitor
chrysler,
to
say
that
this
was
retrospective
as
to
people
who
were
injured
prior
to
1981,
the
legislature
responded
with
resolutions
which
said
that
it
was
never
the
intention
of
this
legislation
to
deal
retroactively
as
to
these
people
who
were
previously
injured.
and
i
do
not
recall
the
history
that
counsel
recites
that
there
was
a
failure
in
the
legislature
to
enact
new
legislation.
there
was
no
reason
for
the
legislature
to
enact
new
legislation.
they
enacted
the
resolutions.
then,
throughout
the
entire
administrative
process
which
followed,
throughout
the
entire
lower
court
judicial
process
that
followed,
the
position
of
general
motors
and
ford
were
consistently
and
universally
rejected.
it
was
not
until
the
michigan
supreme
court
spoke
in
1985
that
general
motors
prevailed
and
it
prevailed
again,
on
arguments
diametrically
opposed
to
the
arguments
which
are
being
made
here.
there
was
immediate
revulsion,
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
overstatement,
to
the
decision
that
the
court
had
reached
because
it
was--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--on
the
part,
i
think,
of
people
generally,
certainly
on
the
part
of
the
legislature,
on
the
part
of
the
former
governor
who
had
sponsored
the
coordination
proposition
in
the
first
place,
the
administrative
officers
who
had
administered
it
and
had
sponsored
it
as
well,
as
far
as
the
public
generally.
and
indeed,
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
chambers
concluded
within
weeks,
following
on
a
motion
for
rehearing,
that
the
methodology
of
the
court
was
wrong
and
that
she
had
erred
and
she
acknowledged
harsh
and
unforeseen
circumstances.
this
is
part
of
the
decision
in
the
chambers
case
in
terms
of
what
was
then
a
denial
of
rehearing.
now
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
there
is
a
2-year
period
as
i
heard
counsel
say,
what
immediately
happened
was
that
it
within
weeks,
there
was
legislation
which
was
introduced
into
the
house.
by
january
of
1986,
within
4
or
5
weeks
after
the
introduction
of
that
legislation,
it
had
passed
the
house
of
representatives
in
michigan,
which
did
exactly
what
the
law
ultimately
enacted
did.
so...
and
what
was
involved
there,
counsel
decries
understandably
the
retroactivity,
but
what
the
legislature
was
seeking
to
correct
was
retroactivity,
because
this
was
the
first
time
in
some
75
years
in
the
history
of
the
michigan
statute
that
there
ever
had
been
a
cutback
in
workers'
benefits,
whether
retroactively
or
prospectively.
he
errs,
with
all
respect,
when
he
says
there
has
not
been...
there
had
not
been,
rather...
retroactive
legislation
or
amendments
to
the
workers'
comp
act
affecting
employers.
they
are
assembled
in
footnote
1
of
our
brief.
the
court
had
several
times
spoken
retroactively
in
a
primary
sense,
as
well
as
a
secondary
sense,
in
making
adjustments
where
there
was
a
conclusion
that
such
adjustments
were
necessary.
and
the
michigan
court,
in
the
lahti
case
and
the
rookledge
case
and
several
other
cases
mentioned
there,
had
acted
in
that
form.
so
that
what
this
was
all
about,
to
make
a
long
story
short
was
that--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
michigan
supreme
court.
mr.
theodore
sachs
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
there
were...
can
i
be
more
specific,
please?
first
of
all,
there
was
an
increase
in
compensation
periods
for
health
and
welfare
benefits.
that
was
the
lahti
case.
there
was
originally
a
24-month
limit.
the
court
extended
that
to
later
times.
the
selk
case
involved
retroactivity
regarding
previously
unpaid
interest
on
workers'
compensation
award.
the
rookledge
case,
which
we
discuss
in
the
footnote,
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
an
injured
worked
had
to
make
a
binding
election
as
to
whether
to
accept
workers'
compensation
or,
alternatively,
to
sue
a
third
party
tort-feasor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
there
isn't...
no,
not
as
such,
your
honor,
because
there
is
no
such
thing
under
the
michigan
statute
as
a
closed
period.
the
statute
through
all
of
the
decades
involved
here--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--no,
because,
your
honor,
there
never
had
been
an
occasion
before--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--as
i
was
just
starting
to
explain,
in
the
rookledge
case,
for
example,
where
an
election
had
previously
been
required
as
between
accepting
a
workers'
comp
benefit
or
suing
a
third-party
tort-feasor,
the
legislature
declared
that
that
election
was
no
longer
required
by
an
amendment
to
the
workers'
compensation
act.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
construed
that
to
be
retroactive
to
causes
of
action
which
arose
prior
to
the
amendment,
thereby
reactivating
a
claim
which
had
previously
been
waived.
so
that
in--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--no,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
it
did
not.
this
was
the
first
time--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--no,
your
honor,
it
was...
i've...
yes,
i
know
you
have
so
held,
but
what
it
is,
what
the
court
had
said
in
the
earlier
cases
was
that
the
election
was
a
fatal
one,
not
statute
of
limitation,
but
a
permanent
and
irrevocable
election,
and
the
court
in
effect
reinstated
a
claim
that
did
not
previously
exist.
more
pertinently
to
the
present
circumstances,
the
reason
why
the
action
was
taken
here
and
had
in
the
legislative
judgment,
which
i
suggest
is
the
dispositive
fact,
had
to
be
taken
here
was
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
75
years
where
the
legislature,
at
least
as
construed
in
the
opinion
in
the
legislature,
misconstrued
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
had
reduced
benefits.
and
the
only
way
that
could
be
dealt
with
if
it
was
going
to
be
rectified
was
responding
to
the
particular
action
which
had
occurred.
what
i
was
starting
to
say
earlier,
justice
kennedy,
was
that
section
831
of
the
act,
which
existed
through
all
of
this
period,
said
that,
quotes,
"neither
the
payment
of
compensation
or
the
accepting
of
the
same
by
the
employee
or
his
dependents
shall
be
considered
as
a
determination
of
the
rights
of
the
parties
under
this
act.
"
so
that
there
could
be
no
claim
of
reliance,
the
act
expressly
foreclosed
that
possibility
because
payment
itself
or
the
receipt
of
benefits
was
nondeterminative.
if
i
may,
i
want
to
zero
in
on
the
extraordinary
proposition
that's
urged
by
general
motors
and
ford,
under
contract
clause
theory
they
say,
that
what
the
michigan
legislature
has
said
not
only
is
workers'
compensation
a
contract
when
the
michigan
law
is
quite
to
the
contrary,
but
also
it's
a
contract
which
accepts
anything
that
occurs
down
the
road.
that
i
would
suggest,
reduces
the
contract
clause
claim
to
utter
incoherence.
the
theory
of...
the
original
brief's
theory
was
that
there
was
a
contract
clause
claim
because
it's
supposed
to
incorporate
all
of
this
other
external
law.
but
that
is
the
existing
external
law.
one
doesn't
incorporate
law
that
comes
down
later
and
make
a
contract
claim
theory.
then
in
turn,
when
these
injured
workers
ceased
to
be
employees
there
is
no
employment
contract
into
which
to
incorporate
their
claim.
and
if,
then,
the
claim
is
that
the
contractual
theory
is
that
we
accept
anything
that
comes
down
later,
that
reduces
us
all
to
nonsense
because
ultimately
what
they
are
saying
is,
as
phrased
in
your
question,
justice
scalia,
the
last
enactment
is
what
the
employer
has
promised
long
ago
to
abide
by.
well,
that
hardly
is
the
notion
or
concept
or
purpose
of
the
contract
clause,
which
is
supposed
to,
in
petitioners'
view
and
at
least
in
the
history,
to
give
some
confidence
in
terms
of
reliance
and
expectation.
there
is
no
expectation;
these
petitioners
can
hardly
claim
to
be
able
to
plan
their
affairs
if
they
are
going
to
be
vulnerable
to
whatever
the
michigan
legislature
does
much
later.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i
don't
think
forbes
is
applicable
here,
your
honor.
forbes
was
simply
a
case
of
retroactivity
without
any
equitable
justification...
increasing
tolls
several
years
earlier.
that's
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
specific
response
to
a
judicial
decision
deemed
to
be
misconstrued,
and
whether
or
not
accurately
misconstrued...
and
we
suggest
that
it
was...
correcting
harsh
and
unexpected
developments
which
occurred.
now,
that's
a
classic
case
in
which
retroactivity
has
occurred.
the
classic
instance,
indeed,
are
the
portal-to-portal
cases,
decided
by
hundreds
of
courts.
hundreds...
literally
hundreds
of
federal
courts,
hundreds
of
federal
judges,
unanimously
saying
that
in
that
instance
it
was
perceived
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
mt.
clemens
pottery
upset
settled
expectations
as
the
interpretation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
there,
general
motors
and
ford
led
the
litigants
in
reaching
back,
to
use
their
phrase,
9
years
to
correct
what
was
perceived
to
be
a
misconstruction
of
the
court
with
unexpected
consequences.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that
was
an
act
of
congress,
but
in
terms
of
due
process
analysis,
which
concededly
was
involved
there,
there
was
found
to
be
no
problem--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--well,
this
court
denied
certiorari
hundreds
of
times
and
as
one
court
said,
well,
customarily,
denial
of
certiorari
imports
nothing
as
to
the
meaning
on
the
merits.
the
assertion,
at
least
of
that
appellate
court
was
that
when
it's
denied
hundreds
of
times,
perhaps
it
has
some
greater
significance.
learned
hand,
among
many
other
distinguished
jurists,
found
no
difficulty
in
the
conclusions
reached.
and
again,
general
motors
and
ford
were
arguing
exactly
the
opposite.
moreover,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
due
process
analysis,
and
i
do
want
to
be
responsive
to
justice
scalia's
earlier
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
holdings
and
the
reasoning
of
turner
elkhorn
and
of
pbgc
and
sperry,
as
well
as
the
portal-to-portal
cases,
conceded...
the
latter,
concededly,
not
by
this
court,
are
really
dispositive
here.
there
has
to
be
a
way,
and
it
has
been
recognized
repeatedly
in
the
decisions,
to
deal
with
errors
which
occur
along
the
way
or
with
conditions
which
were
not
anticipated
and
require
attention.
the
black
lung
cases
are
a
classic
example.
that--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
would
concede
that,
your
honor.
they
were
not
retroactive
in
the
sense
of
being
curative,
but
that
makes
the
point.
there,
this
court
upheld
legislation
where
there
was
plainly
a
change
in
policy
by
the
congress.
the
congress
concluded
that
because
of
the
long
period
of
latency
of
the
black
lung
disease,
the
prevalence,
the
seriousness
of
the
problems
which
were
not
apparent,
it
made
appropriate
sense
in
terms
of
the
adjustments
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
economic
life
to
use
the
court's
phrase,
to
impose
liability,
not
as
a
matter
of
contract,
but
as
a
matter
of
the
judgment
of
the
congress
in
that
instance
to
impose
liability
on
employers
with
respect
to
what
these
employers
called
completed
transactions,
namely
employees
who
have
long
since
terminated
their
employment
but
for
whom
an
obligation
is
imposed.
pbgc
said
essentially
the
same
thing.
there
was
retroactivity
there,
not
only
in
the
so-called
window
period
of
a
few
months
before
the
enactment
of
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments
act,
but
also
in
effect,
imposing
liability
going
back
decades
as
to
employers
who
had
never
assumed
pension
liabilities
at
all
in
the
sense
of
having
to
fund
what
were
theretofore
unfunded
liabilities.
so
that
in
turner
elkhorn
and
in
pbgc,
we
have
not
curative,
but
straight
retroactive
legislation
as
to
which
there
is
no
problem.
this
court
has
found
no
problem.
mr.
theodore
sachs
the
answer
to
the
minimum
wage
is
that
it
is
not
necessarily
okay.
the
retroactivity
might
or
might
not
be
acceptable,
dependent
upon
the
purpose
that
it
may
be
perceived
by
the
legislature
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
just
as
the
legislature
may
make
judgments,
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
think
that
may
be
questionable
under
those
circumstances
if
there
is
not
more
involved.
there
is
obviously
minimum
scrutiny.
there
has
to
be
deference.
under
the
court's
holdings,
there
is
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
and
all
of
that
is
at
play.
but
then
one
has
to
inquire
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
that
may
be
done.
there
may
be,
there
conceivably
can
be
circumstances
where
there
can
be
that
retroactivity.
there
may
be
circumstances
where
its
inappropriate.
this
court
found
in
spannaus
an
inappropriate
circumstance--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--no,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
sachs
you're
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
when
this
court
has
applied
the
elements
of
energy
reserves
and
come
to
the
question
of
legitimacy
of
public
purpose
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
means
applied,
there
has
been
a
deferential
standard,
and
therefore
some
minimization
of
scrutiny
in
those
circumstances,
particularly
in
an
extraordinarily,
highly
regulated
area
such
as
workers'
compensation.
there
is
a
particular
need
in
the
area
of
workers'
compensation
to
be
able
to
deal
with
retroactivity,
just
as
the
states
have
to
be
able
to
deal
with
it,
just
as
congress
did
it
in
the
black
lungs
case.
as
medical
science
developed,
as
increasing
problems
are
realized
in
terms
of
the
latency
of
diseases
and
prolonged
development,
there
has
to
be
an
ability
to
relate
back
and
to
deal
with
those.
there
equally
has
to
be
an
ability
to
deal
with
the
problems
which
arise
in
terms
of
the
imperfect
expression
in
the
legislation
or
where
harsh
and
unforeseen
consequences
occur,
as
occurred
here.
the
briefs
of
the
united
states
amicus
in
this
case,
the
brief
of
the
council
of
state
governments'
amicus
in
this
case
develop
i
think
extremely
well
and
at
length--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
was
an
option,
but
it
was
not
a
required
option,
which
is
the
key.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
in
an
absolute
sense,
your
honor,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
in
the
legislative
judgment
as
to
what
was
moral
and
to
correct
terrible
injustice
here
and
terrible
hardship
and
a
thoroughly
unexpected
development,
the
legislature
deemed
it
appropriate
to
do
all
that
it
did
do,
which
was
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante.
it
recreated
the
original
expectations,
if
there
were
expectations,
of
everybody
affected.
it
imposed
no
greater
liability
on
ford
and
gm
than
they
had
any
legitimate
right
to
expect
in
the
first
place.
the
relief
granted
was
surgically
tailored--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--your
honor--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--it
was...
the
michigan
supreme
court
applying
a
rule
of
construction
and
no
more,
has,
by
its
own
acknowledgement,
concluded
that
because
the
legislature
had
not
adequately
indicated
an
intention
not
to
apply
to
previous
injuries,
that
the
act
would
not
be
construed
to
exclude
the
application
to
those
injuries.
mr.
theodore
sachs
not
the
final
authority,
with
all
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
then
there
is
another
case
before
the
michigan
supreme
court,
namely
this
case.
and
in
the
interim
the
michigan
legislature
has
spoken,
and
the
michigan
legislature--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--i
am
talking
now
about
the
current
law,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
and
my
point
is,
that
when
the
michigan
supreme
court,
having
seen
what
the
legislature
did
in
1987
and
concluding
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
like...
deemed
that
consistent
with
its
own
ruling
or
not,
concluded
that
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law,
the
legislature
had
the
right
to
repair
the
damage
that
was
done
the
first
time.
mr.
theodore
sachs
clearly,
your
honor,
they
had
no
expectations
based
on
the
chambers
decision,
which
didn't
come
down
until
1985,
the
last
day
in
1985.
for
all
the
years
preceding
that,
every
expression,
legislative,
administrative,
and
lower
court,
was
contrary
to
their
position.
so
there
could
have
been
no
claim
of
reliance.
they
knew
as
well
that
all
of
their
competitors,
that
the
rest
of
industry
and
others,
interpret
it
differently.
so
they...
whatever
view
they
were
asserting
was
a
controversial
view
and
not
based
on
any
expression
by
the
highest
court.
the
decision
to
which
your
honor
relates
again,
only
came
at
the
end
of
1985,
some
16
months
before
the
new
legislation
was
adopted
and
only
a
few
weeks
before
the
house
spoke.
so
there
was
never
a
period
when
general
motors
and
ford
had
any
legitimate
reason
to
believe
that
this
matter
was
final
until
the
legislature
indeed
finally
spoke.
prior
to
december
1985,
this
was
a
matter
that
was
highly
contested,
with
every
authority
dealing
with
the
matter
rejecting
their
view.
afterward,
the
legislature
in
one
house
had
spoken,
the
matter
was
in
ferment,
and
finally
the
legislators...
the
legislature
spoke,
with
the
michigan
supreme
court
concluding
that
they
had
the
authority
to
do
so.
this
is,
in
the
final
analysis,
a
matter
of
state
determination,
the
exercise
of
its
judgment.
counsel
began
by
talking
about
whether
the
legislature
originally
had
authority
to
reach
this
accommodation?
of
course
it
did.
it
could
have
concluded
that
there
should
be
offset,
it
could
have
concluded,
as
it
had
for
decades
before,
there
should
not
be
offset.
it
made
that
judgment.
it
made
that
judgment
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers.
counsel
points
to
workers'
comp,
but
under
the
theory
of
contract
which
they
urge,
they
would
have
to,
in
quotes,
"incorporate
osha
laws,
eeo
laws,
labor
laws,
minimum
wage
laws,
ordinary
labor
laws.
"
there
is
no
law
which
effects
the
workplace
which
under
their
theory
would
not
be
incorporated.
and
where
does
that
lead?
that,
under
a
contract
theory,
under
their
theory,
there
is
absolutely
no
distinction
between
contract
and
due
process.
that's
not
the
law
of
this
court.
it's
not
the
law
of
michigan.
it
has
not
been
the
law
anywhere,
and
there
is
no
justification
for
that
position.
for
those
reasons,
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
would
conclude.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
