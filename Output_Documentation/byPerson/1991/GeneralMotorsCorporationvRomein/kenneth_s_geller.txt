mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
maybe
it
please
the
court:
up
until
1982,
employees
in
the
state
of
michigan
who
reached
retirement
age
with
a
job-related
disability
were
entitled
to
collect
workers'
compensation
benefits
and
retirement
benefits,
even
though
both
workers'
compensation
benefits
and
retirement
benefits
were
intended
to
compensate
an
employee
of
the
same
exact
wage
loss.
in
many
cases
this
allowed
retired
employees
to
earn
more
money
after
retirement
than
they
would
have
earned
if
they
had
continued
to
work.
now,
needless
to
say,
this
so-called
retiree
problem
was
quite
costly
to
employers
and
was
considered
by
many
government
officials
to
be
the
single
biggest
liability
to
maintaining
and
attracting
business
to
the
state
of
michigan.
the
michigan
legislature
responded
to
this
problem
in
1981
by
passing
a
statute
that
authorized
employers
to
coordinate
workers'
compensation
benefits
with
various
other
benefits
provided
by
employers.
under
the
1981
statute,
which
became
effective
on
march
31,
1982,
employers
were
allowed
to
offset
workers'
compensation
benefits
against
the
amounts
that
an
employee
was
otherwise
receiving
from
employer-sponsored
wage
replacement
programs,
such
as
pensions
and
social
security.
now
a
few
years
after
the
1981
statute
went
into
effect,
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
in
a
case
called
chambers...
unanimously
held
that
the
coordination
provisions
applied
to
all
payments
of
workers'
compensation
after
march
31,
1982,
regardless
of
when
the
employee
happened
to
have
been
injured.
the
court
reached
this
conclusion
by
relying
on
the
plain
language
of
the
1981
statute,
the
structure
of
the
statute,
and
the
legislative
purpose
in
requiring
coordination
of
benefits
in
the
first
place.
now,
the
chambers
decision
was
immediately
attacked
by
employee
groups
in
the
state
of
michigan,
and
efforts
were
made
to
overrule
it
legislatively.
almost
2
years
later,
in
may
of
1987,
the
michigan
legislature
passed
a
statute
abolishing
coordination
of
workers'
benefits
for
employees
injured
prior
to
march
31,
1982.
but
the
legislature
was
not
content
simply
to
abolish
coordination
of
workers'
compensation
benefits
prospectively;
they
went
much
further.
the
1987
statute
explicitly
announced
that
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
in
chambers
was
erroneously
decided,
had
erroneously
interpreted
the
intent
of
1981
legislature.
and
to
remedy
this
perceived
error,
what
the
michigan
legislature
did
in
1987
was
to
repeal
the
1981
coordination
provision
retroactively
and
required
employers
to
make
refunds,
with
interest,
to
all
employees
whose
benefits
had
been
lawfully
coordinated
during
the
5-year
period
that
the
1981
statute
had
been
in
effect.
now,
petitioners
did
not
challenge
the
1987
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
affected
the
amount
of
workers'
compensation
benefits
payable
prospectively;
but
they
claimed
that
the
retroactive
provisions
of
the
statute
violated
the
contracts
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
to
the
extent
that
it
required
employers
to
go
back
and
reassess
their
workers'
compensation
obligations
for
the
years
1982
to
1987
under
a
completely
different
set
of
rules
than
were
in
effect
during
that
period
of
time.
the
michigan
courts
rejected
these
federal
constitutional
claims,
and
we
have
renewed
them
in
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
contract
is
the
contract
of
employment
between
employers
in
the
state
and
these
employees.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
no--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
there
was
no
coordination
of
benefits
at
that
time,
justice
o'connor.
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
because
the
terms
of
the
contract,
we
allege,
your
honor,
are
that
employers
will
make
workers'
compensation
benefits
to
disabled
employees
in
whatever
amount
is
lawful
at
the...
during
the
period
of
time
of
disability.
after
all,
the
amounts
that
may
be
lawful
will
vary
in
the
future
based
upon
what
the
legislature
determines
in
light
of
existing
events.
it
may
go
up;
it
may
go
down.
the
contract
obligation
is
pay
whatever
the
amount
is
that
is
lawful
during
every
subsequent
period
of
disability,
and
that
was
what
we...
what
we
assert
was
the
contractual
obligation
and
the
contractual
expectation.
now,
at
the
time
that
these
employees
became
injured
there
was
no
coordination,
but
subsequently
there
was
coordination,
and
the
employers
satisfied
their
contractual
obligation
by
paying
coordinated
benefits
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
that
can
be
argued
in
this
case
because
the
michigan--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
essentially
a
question
of
state
law.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
argument
in
this
case
because
we
know
from
the
michigan
supreme
court's
definitive
decision
in
the
chambers
case
that
the
benefits
could
go
down
as
well
as
up,
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
contract.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
a
federal
law
component
in
determining
whether
the
contract
has
been
impaired.
you
have
to
determine,
of
course,
what
the
contract
is
in
order
to
determine
whether
subsequent
legislation
impairs
it.
and
what
we
say
is
that
the
terms
of
the
contract
here,
as
is
shown
by
the
consistent
experience
in
michigan
under
the
workers'
compensation
statute
is
that
the
employers
are
not
promising
to
pay
any
specific
amount
in
the
future.
they
have
promised
to
pay
whatever
the
amount
is
that
is
lawful
for
subsequent
periods
of
disability,
and
that's
of
course
exactly
what
general
motors
did
here...
and
ford...
between
1982
and
1987.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
this
is
not
a
class
action,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
went
to
work
well
before
the
1981
statute
was
passed,
although
they
did
not
become
disabled,
at
least
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
respondents,
until
right
before
the
1981
statute
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
was
an
at-will.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
satisfied
their
obligations
during
19...
during
the
period
19--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
right,
they
satisfied
completely
their
obligations
under
the
existing
law
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
covered
terms
and
conditions
of
employment--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
suppose.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
specific
terms.
there
are
people
who--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
these
employees
may
have
been
at-will
employees.
there
are
other
employees
who
are
not.
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
to
the
resolution
of
the
case,
though.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
it's
based
on
that.
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
workers'
compensation
is
simply
one
form
of
compensation
that's
paid
to
employees
in
return
for
their
promise
to
work.
every
other
term
of
the
contract,
unquestionably...
every
other
form
of
compensation,
i
think
we
would
all
agree
is
pursuant
to
the
contract.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
believe
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely.
i
think
part
of
the
problem
in
this
case...
this
is
an
extraordinary...
extraordinary
statute.
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
the
extraordinary
nature
of
this
statute.
never
before
in
the
75-year
history
of
workers'
compensation
in
michigan
and
as
far
as
we
know,
never
before
in
the
history
of
workers'
compensation
in
any
state
has
a
legislature
ever
gone
back,
raised
the
workers'
compensation
benefits
for
past
closed
periods
and
imposed
the
obligation
retroactively
on
employers
to
pay
those
benefits.
now
the...
and
never
before
in
our
view
has
this
court
ever
upheld
a
statute
of
that
nature,
a
purely
retroactive
statute
of
that
nature.
now
the
respondents
attempt
to
defend
this
statute
by
trading
on
an
ambiguity
in
the
word
retroactive.
as
justice
scalia's
opinion
in
the
georgetown
hospital
case
a
few
years
ago
noted,
the
word
retroactive
is
applied
to
two
quite
different
types
of
statutes.
one
type
of
statute
is
purely
retroactive
in
the
sense
that
it
changes
what
the
law
was
in
the
past.
it
reached...
it
reaches
back
and
alters
the
past
legal
consequences
of
already
completed
transactions.
now
those
laws
are
said
to
be
retroactive
in
the
primary
sense
of
the
term.
now,
other
more
common
laws
contain
elements
of
both
retroactivity
and
prospectivity.
they
affect
the
future
legal
consequences
of
past
events.
these
laws
are
said
to
be
retroactive
in
the
secondary
sense
of
the
term.
now
respondents'
briefs
are
full
of
statements
suggesting
that
the
michigan
legislature
has
frequently
enacted
retroactive
laws
in
the
workers'
compensation
area,
and
that
this
court
has
frequently
upheld
such
retroactive
legislation.
but
all
of
the
instances
that
they
rely
on,
without
exception,
involve
laws
that
were
retroactive
in
the
secondary
sense
of
the
term.
in
other
words,
the
legislature
had
from
time
to
time
increased
or
altered
the
amount
of
workers'
compensation
benefits,
payable
prospectively,
although
it
made
those
laws
applicable
to
people
who
were...
who
had
suffered
preexisting
disabilities.
now
that's
a
quite
different
type
of
law
than
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
would
have
been
on
construction
of
the
1981
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
we
would
have
the
same
attack,
although
i
think
our
reliance
interest
would
be
marginally
weaker
because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--except
that
here
we
have
a
definitive
construction
of
the
1981
statute
by
the
michigan
supreme
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
for
the
period
from
1981
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
we
would
have
much
the
same
arguments.
i
think
our
case
is
even
stronger
though,
justice
stevens,
because
we
do
have
a
definitive
construction
in
1985
of
this
law,
and
it
was
only
2
years
later
that
the
court...
that
the
michigan
legislature
says
the
1981
statute
didn't
mean
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
we
know
for
a
fact
that
it
did
mean
what
the
chambers
court
said.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
a
prompt
reaction
to
the
chambers
decision,
but
it
wasn't
until
19
months
later
that
the
statute
was
passed
overruling
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
we
would
have
no
challenge
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--'81,
that's
right.
in
fact,
the
1987
law,
justice
white,
was
prospective
and
retroactive.
we
have
not
challenged
the
prospective
aspects
of
the
law.
let
me
just
say
in
answer
to
justice
stevens
question
that
there
was
an
immediate
reaction
to
the
chambers
decision,
but
the...
the
bills
that
were
introduced
in
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
in
michigan
did
not
all
provide
for
retroactive
liability.
the
bills
that
were
introduced
in
the
senate
provided
only
for
prospective
changes
in
the
coordination
rules,
and
it
was
not
until
8
days
before
the
bill
was
actually
passed
in
1987
that
a
conference
committee
agreed
to
put
in
this
retroactive
provision.
now,
the
court
below
gave
two
reasons
for
rejecting
our
contract
clause
claim.
the
first
reason
which
took
up
only
a
single
sentence
of
its
opinion
and
was
not
otherwise
explained
was
the
assertion
that
workers'
compensation
benefits
are
not
contractual
and
they
are
therefore
not
protected
by
the
contracts
clause
against...
subsequent
legislative
impairment.
we
believe,
and
we
have
gotten
into
this
a
little
bit
already,
but
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
undisputed
facts
concerning
the
nature
of
workers'
compensation
in
michigan
and
contrary
to
many
cases
that
this
court
construing
contractual
obligations
under
the
contracts
clause.
now
respondents
don't
deny
that
their
relationship
with
the
petitioners
is
contractual.
they're
employees
who
were
working
under
contracts
of
employment
with
ford
and
general
motors,
and
under
those
contracts
of
employment
they
were
entitled
to
many
different
types
of
compensation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
the
1981
statute
was
prospective
only.
in
other
words,
it
only
dealt
with--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--once
again,
it
gets
to
the
question
we
were
talking
to
justice
o'connor
about,
what
was
the
nature
of
the
contract?
we
say
that
the
contractual
understanding
was
that
employers
would
pay
for
every
period
of...
subsequent
period
of
disability,
the
amount
that
was
determined
to
be
the
lawful
amount
to
pay
for
workers'
compensation
benefits.
now,
the
1981
statute
was
prospective
only.
it
changed
what
the
lawful
amount
was
in
workers'
compensation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was
a
somewhat
lesser
amount,
and
general
motors
and
ford
paid
that
amount
lawfully
during
the
period
between
1982
and
1987.
the
distinction--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
do.
we
take
that
position--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
state
court--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it's
not
clear,
justice
o'connor.
the
state
court
had
a
sentence
in
its
opinion--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
and
i
think
you
can
for
two
reasons.
one
is
there
are
many,
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
whether
or
not
something
is
a
contract
and
therefore
subject
to
the
protections
of
the
contracts
clause
is
a
federal
question.
and
this
court
has
in
the
past
disagreed
with
statements
by
state
courts
that
things
that
look
like
contracts
were
not
in
fact
contracts.
secondly,
we
don't
have
a
reasoned
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
explaining
why
this
is
not
a
contract,
and
in
fact,
its
statement
that
this
is
not
a
contract
is
inconsistent
with
prior
decisions
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
cases
like
mcavoy
and
selk,
which
have
said
that
the
obligation
of
employers
under
the
workers'
compensation
statute
in
michigan
is
contractual.
so
for
those
two
reasons
we
think
that
it's
a
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
we...
justice
scalia,
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
situation
where
in
the
future
the
amount
might
be
increased,
might
be
decreased.
we
can
take
that
into
account
in
deciding
what
other
types
of
compensation
to
pay,
how
to
measure
the
cost
of
our
product.
that's
quite
different
than
saying--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
you
assume--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
we
also
have
a
due
process
claim--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--exactly,
and
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
employers
in
this
case
did
between
1982
and
1987
they
paid
the
exact
amounts
that
michigan
had
said
they
were
obligated
to
pay
under
their
workers'
compensation
obligations,
and
they
took
that
into
account
in
making
a
number
of
business
decisions
as
to
what
their
expenses
were
during
that
period.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
weren't
darn
sure,
your
honor,
but
they
looked
at
the
plain
language
of
the
1981
statute,
which
draws
no
distinction
between
people--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
the
reason
why
the
legislature
in
1981
passed
this
coordination
of
benefits
provision,
and
i
think
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
chambers
asked
that
question.
they
did
it
because
the
employers
in
the
state
were
facing
extraordinary
obligations
to
pay
workers'
compensation
as
well
as
these
other
types
of
employer-financed
benefits.
it
would
have
made
no
sense
to
say
that
the
coordination
provision
provided...
applied
only
to
people
who
had
got
disabled
after
19...
march
31,
1982,
because
that
would
have
saved,
at
least
at
the
outset,
an
infinitesimal
amount
of
money.
the
only
way
that
the
legislature
could
have
achieved
the
purpose
of
the
1981
statue
was
to
make
that
statute
applicable
to
all
payments
of
workers'
compensation
payable
after
march
31,
1982,
regardless
of
when
the
employees
were
disabled.
but
the
employees
were
willing
to
take
the
chance
that
that
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
their
reliance
was
found
to
be
completely
justified
by
the
united...
unanimous
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
chambers.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
in
1981.
they
had...
in
1980.
in
1980,
justice
white,
there
had
been
other
amendments
to
the
workers's
compensation
statute.
now
the
effect
of
those
amendments
was
that
for
some
class
of
employees
it
increased
the
amount
of
workers'
compensation--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
in
1980...
let
me
say
this
to
begin
with.
the
other
side
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
tries
to
draw
a
nexus
between
the
1980
and
1981
statutes,
and
they
have
conjured
up
this
notion
that
the
1981
statute
was
in
fact
a
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem
caused
in
1980,
and
that
it
was
a
trade-off
and
that
people
who
didn't
get
benefit
increases
in
1981...
in
1980,
were
not
subject
to
coordination
in
1981.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
for
the
notion
that
there
was
a
nexus
here.
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
1981
statute
was
tied
to
the
1980
statute,
but
let
me
say
this--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
obligation
to
coordinate
was
exactly
the
same
and
people
who
were
injured
prior
to
1980
did
get
an
increase
in
benefits
in
1980.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
no,
they
may
or
may
not
have
been.
there
was
a
different
system
in
place
for
calculating
workers'
compensation
benefits
after...
for
people
who
were
injured
after
1982
and
in
some
cases
it
increased
benefits
and
in
some
cases
it
didn't.
but
my
view
is
that
there
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--people
who
were
hurt
before
1981
were
entitled
to
get
supplemental
workers'
compensation
benefits
under
a
statute
passed
in
1980,
and
some
of
these
benefits
were
very
substantial
and
led
to
increases
of
up
to
85
percent
in
their
benefits.
and
those
workers'
compensation
benefits,
justice
white,
those
supplemental
benefits,
were
not
subject
to
coordination.
so
it
is
not
the
case
that
people
who
are
injured
prior
to
1982
were
much
worse
off
in
terms
of
the
amount
that
they
collected
than
people
who
were
injured
after
1982.
but
the
salient
point
is
that
there
is
no
nexus
because
the
1981
and
1980
statutes,
and
there
was
not
a
tradeoff.
now
if
we
are
right...
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
why
we
think
workers'
compensation
benefits
in
michigan
are
contractual
by
just
using
one
hypothetical
here.
if
the
michigan
statute
had
said
every
employer
who
enters
into
a
contract
of
employment
in
the
state
must
include
the
following
terms
in
the
contract,
and
they
thereafter
set
out
the
terms
of
the
workers'
compensation
package,
i
think
it
would
be
easy
for
everyone
to
see
why
that
became
part
of
the
contract.
now,
what
we
suggest
is
that
the
situation
in
michigan
was
indistinguishable
from
that.
what
the
state
of
michigan
has
said
is
that
if
you
wish
to
enter
a...
into
a
contract
of
employment
in
the
state,
you
must
offer
your
employees
at
least
the
following
compensation
in
cases
of
job-related
disability--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
would.
if
an
employer
and
an
employee
entered
into
a
contract
to
pay
the
minimum
wage
in
return
for
work
and
if
5
years
later
the
state
decided
that
the
minimum
wage
had
been
too
low
and
raised
it
retroactively,
we
suggest
that
there
would
in
fact
be
a
substantial...
in
addition
to
due
process
challenge...
contract--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
many
regulations
are
in
fact
just
that,
a
regulation
of
the
employer,
and
it's
irrelevant
whether
the
employer
has
contracts
of
employment
or
whatever.
but
the
workers'
compensation
scheme
is
quite
different.
there
must
under
michigan
law
be
a
contract
of
employment.
the
employer
is
not
obligated
to
pay
workers'
compensation
except
in
return
for
work
that
is
done
by
that
employee.
it
is
one
form
of
compensation.
every
other
form
of
compensation
works
its
way
into
the
contract,
and
we
say
that
that
is
the
case
with
workers'
compensation
as
well.
i
might
say
that
if
the
state
of
michigan
could
do
this,
it
could
decide
for
example
that
the
minimum
wage
law,
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
was
too
low
during
the
period
1982
and
1987
and
it
could
pass
a
statute
retroactively
increasing
the
amount
of
minimum
wage
and
make
the
employer
pay
the
difference
with
interest,
which
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
might
well
raise
problems
under
the
contracts
clause,
although
the
reliance
interest--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
you
know
the
turner
elkhorn
case,
your
honor,
which
was
not,
of
course,
a
contracts
clause
case,
was
a
law
that
was
retroactive
in
the
secondary
sense
only.
it
did
not
go
back
and
impose
new
obligations
for
past
periods
of
time.
all
it
said
is
that
henceforth
you
have
to
pay
workers'
compensation
to
a
particular
category
of
employees.
so
it
was
not
at
all
like
the...
that's
why
i
said
earlier,
this
is
an
extraordinary
type
of
law,
and
i
don't
know
that
this
court
has
ever,
ever
upheld
a
decision...
a
statute
of
this
type.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
there--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
because
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
a
question--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
a
question,
justice
scalia,
of
what
the
contractual
expectations
are.
now
if
there
had
been
a
history
of
that
sort
of
legislation,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
stronger
argument.
but
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
on
the
first
occasion,
that
it
can
be
imposed
retroactively,
in
light
of
the
reliance
interest.
now
even
if
we
are
wrong
in
our
contracts
clause
challenge,
let
me
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
due
process
clause,
because
the
due
process
clause
independently
imposes
substantial
limits
on
the
state's
ability
to
retroactively
enact
civil
legislation.
and
once
important...
once
again,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
distinguish
between
the
two
types
of
retroactive
legislation
mentioned
earlier.
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
upholding
legislation
that
was
retroactive
in
the
sense
of
imposing
future
legal
consequences
on
past
events.
all
of
the
cases
that
respondents
rely
on,
such
as
turner
elkhorn,
fall
in
that
category.
but
the
court
has
taken
a
quite
different
approach
when
dealing
with
statutes
that
are
retroactive
in
this
primary
sense,
statutes
that
change
the
law
in
the
past,
that
changed
the
past
legal
consequences
of
past
events.
in
that
type
of
case,
the
court
has
upheld
retroactive
statutes
against
the
due
process
challenge
in
only
two
situations
that
we
are
aware
of.
now,
the
first
situation
which
usually
arises
in
tax
cases,
is
where
congress
has
imposed
a
short
period
of
retroactivity
to
prevent
people
from
rearranging
their
affairs
to
evade
pending
legislation.
the
gray
case
is
a
good
example
of
that.
that's
certainly
not
our
case
here.
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
short
period
of
retroactivity
to
evade
pending
legislation.
now,
the
second
type
of
case
involves
so-called
curative
legislation.
the
court
on
several
occasions
has
upheld
retroactive
statutes
that
cured
inadvertent
technical
defects
in
prior
legislation...
the
heinszen
case,
for
example,
where
there
was
a
tariff
in
effect,
but
there
was
a
technical
defect
in
it,
and
congress
reenacted
the
tariff
and
made
it
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
original
tariff.
there's
no
problem
in
that
type
of
case
because
it
doesn't
destroy
any
reliance
interests.
such
laws
can't
upset
any
settled
expectations
because
they
in
fact
reaffirm
what
everyone
always
thought
to
be
the
law.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
said
that
retroactive
laws
that
represent
changes
in
legislative
policy
can't
be
imposed
retroactively
because
of
the
fundamental
unfairness
of
imposing
new
rules
of
conduct
on
people
who've
had...
who've
engaged
in
past
completed
transactions
under
different
rules
of
law.
and
the
classic
case
for
this
type
of
retroactive
legislation
is
the
forbes
pioneer
case,
where
the
case
tried
to
enact
a
toll
and
make
it
retroactive
4
years
to
a
time
when
a
ship
had
passed
through
the
canal
thinking
that
there
was
no
toll.
now,
with
these
as
the
relevant
categories,
we
think
it's
easy
to
see
where
the
1987
statute
falls.
the
state
of
michigan
in
its
brief
concedes
the
1987
statute
was
plainly
just
a
change
in
legislative
policy,
was
not
a
curative
law
intended
to
remedy
an
inadvertent
defect.
it
changed
the
law
during
a
5-year
period
of
the
past.
there
were
many,
many
settled
transactions
during
that
5-year
people
that
were
completely
upset--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
in
1982,
justice
o'connor,
the
legislature
had
passed
a
resolution
saying
they
didn't
intend
the
1981...
but
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that.
first
is,
those
resolutions
had
no
retroactive...
aspects
to
them.
they
were
intended
to
operate
only
prospectively.
and
second
and
more
importantly,
in
1982
the
legislature
defeated
a
bill...
defeated
a
bill
that
would
have
amended
the
1981
statute
to
make
it
apply
only
to
people
who
were
injured
after
march
31,
1982.
so
i
think
that's
another
reason
why
the
employer--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--perhaps
not,
but
it
would
have
taken
care
of
a
large
percent
of
the
people.
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
begin
with,
mr.
sachs
claims
that
he
is
unaware
of
the
fact
that
the
legislature
in
1982
defeated
a
bill
that
would
have
made
the
1981
statute
applicable
only
to
people
injured
after
1982,
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
43-a
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
footnote
24,
where
that...
the
defeat
of
that
bill
is
mentioned.
secondly,
mr.
sachs
spent
almost
none
of
his
time
on
the
due
process
clause
today.
the
chief
justice
asked
him
about
the
forbes
case.
what
he
said
about
the
forbes
case
is
that
this
court
held
that
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
was
not
rational,
but
it
was
plainly
rational
to
require
people
to
pay
for
passage
through
a
canal.
why
should
they
get...
why
should
they
go
through
a
canal
for
free?
the
statute
was
struck
down,
not
because
it
wasn't
rational
to
charge
people
for
going
through
a
canal,
but
because
the
statute
completely
destroyed
reliance
interests
of
people
who
had
gone
through
the
canal
thinking
that
it
was
toll
free.
that's
why
it
was
struck
down.
and
the
basic
notion
of
due
process
is
fundamental
fairness
and
one
of
the
basic
notions
of
fundamental
fairness
is
notice,
and
that's
what
we
are
arguing
for
here
today.
now
we
claim
that
general
motors--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--thank
you,
mr.--
