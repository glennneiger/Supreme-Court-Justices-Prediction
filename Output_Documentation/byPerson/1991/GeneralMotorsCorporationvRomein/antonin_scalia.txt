what
were
the
terms
of
their
contract?
was
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at-will
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
i
have
this
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
else
the
contracts
clause
is
meant
to
do
it
is
certainly
meant
to
protect
expectations,
and
i
don't
really
see
that
you
had
any
expectations
here.
as
far
as
you
knew,
when
you
went
into
a
contract
to
pay
whatever
michigan
shall
say
you
will
pay
in
the
future,
not
just
during
the
term
of
employment,
but
even
after
he
leaves
employment
with
a
disability,
michigan
can
kick
it
up
as
high
as
it
likes,
right...
prospectively?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
prospectively,
retrospective.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
any
of
your
contractual
expectations
have
been
disappointed.
you
had
no
contractual
expectations.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
difference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
am
not
sure
the
difference
relates
to
contractual
expectations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
may
be
a
due
process
claim,
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
a
contracts
clause
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
do
make
that.
i
have
trouble
squeezing
it
under
the
contracts
clause,
which
i
usually
think
is
meant
to
protect,
you
know,
by
god,
i
have
a
contract,
and
your
contract
says
nothing
but
i
will
pay
whatever
michigan
says
i
will
pay,
and
they
say
to
pay
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
but
they
didn't
know
under
1985
that
they'd
made
the
right
calculation.
for
4
years
there
they
were...
i
mean,
they
proceeded
perfectly
lawfully,
but
you
can't
say
they
were
darned
sure
they
were
going
to
win.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
bumps
into
a
presumption
against
retroactively
reducing
benefit--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
seems
to
me
if
you
have
contracted
to
pay
whatever
michigan
law
says
in
the
future,
even
after
the
person
has
left
your
employment,
that's
what
you
say
the
contract
is...
we'll
pay
whatever
michigan
says
in
the
future...
why
can't
you
have
promised
to
say
we
will
pay
whatever
michigan
says
we
should
pay
in
the
future
including,
if
michigan
changes
its
mind
and
goes
back
and
decides
that
we
should
have
paid
more
for
some
earlier
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
buy
into
some
of
michigan
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
can't
you
buy
into
all
of
michigan
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
which
case
there's
no
contracts
clause
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
always
has
to
be
a
first
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
claim
is
that
it
was
the
prior
contract,
that
the
term
of
the
prior
contract
when
they
were
employed
was
that
the
employer
would
pay
to
them
in
the
future
whatever
the
then-applicable
michigan
law
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
makes
sense,
whether
you
accept
it
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
they
did
with
the
minimum
wage.
suppose
michigan
just
said,
we
have
had
a
few
years
of
good
prosperity,
the
auto
companies
are
doing
pretty
well,
we're
going
to
say
that
the
minimum
wage
you
should
have
paid
5
years
ago
is
going
to
be
raised
and
you
should
pay
everybody
in
cash
the
difference.
is
that
lawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
want
to
argue
with
you.
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
due
process
arguments
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
will
answer
this
question
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
to
the
minimum
wage
one
is
that's
okay.
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
decided
they
didn't
give
them
enough
money,
that's
all.
they
decided
we
should
have
given
them
more
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
way...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
there
has
to
be
some
way
to
solve
the
problem.
michigan
could
have
solved
the
problem.
they
could
have
taken
michigan
funds
and
paid
these
people
more
money.
they
could
have
said,
gee,
we
made
a
terrible
mistake,
it's
our
fault,
here,
here
is
some
more
money.
the
only
question
is
whether
this
employer
should
be
hit
with
it,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
it's
necessary
in
some
absolute
sense
to
correct
and
dispose--
