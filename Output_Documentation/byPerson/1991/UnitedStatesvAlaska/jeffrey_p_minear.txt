mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
original
action
is
before
the
court
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
secretary
of
the
army
acted
within
his
authority
when
he
refused
to
issue
a
permit
for
construction
of
the
nome
port
facility
unless
alaska
agreed
that
the
construction
would
be
deemed
not
to
alter
the
location
of
the
federal/state
boundary.
some
historical
background
is
necessary
to
understand
this
case.
this
court
ruled
in
a
1947
decision,
california
i,
that
the
federal
government
rather
than
the
individual
states
owns
offshore
submerged
lands.
6
years
later
congress
enacted
two
statutes:
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act;
and
the
submerged
lands
act
which
divided
the
offshore
submerged
lands
between
the
federal
and
state
governments.
congress
gave
the
states
those
submerged
extending,
as
a
general
matter,
3
miles
from
the
coastline.
a
dispute
then
arose
whether
coastal
construction
such
as
port
facilities
should
be
treated
as
part
of
the
coastline
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
grant.
this
court
ruled
in
california
ii
that
harbor
work
should
be
treated
as
part
of
the
coast.
the
court
concludes
that
there
was
no
inequity
in
measuring
the
coast
submerged
lands
grant
based
on
structures
that
the
state
itself
had
built,
because
the
united
states,
through
its
control
over
navigable
waters,
had
the
power
to
protect
its
interests
from
encroachment
and
quote,
the
effect
of
any
future
changes
could
thus
be
the
subject
of
agreement
between
the
parties.
the
army,
which
issues
permits
for
offshore
structures
under
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
revised
its
permitting
regulations
in
response
to
the
california
ii
decision.
those
regulations
now
provide
that
the
army
will
take
into
account
the
effect
of
the
proposed
coastal
construction
on
the
federal/state
boundary
when
determining
whether
to
issue
a
permit.
the
army
applied
those
regulations
to
the
city
of
nome's
proposed
port
facility.
the
army
refused
to
issue
the
permit
unless
alaska
disclaimed
entitlement
to
any
additional
submerged
lands.
alaska
argues
that
the
army
had
no
authority
to
impose
that
requirement.
we
disagree.
congress
has
directed
the
army
to
regulate
the
placement
of
structures
in
navigable
waters.
the
relevant
statute,
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
contains
a
complete
prohibition
on
the
creation
of
any
obstruction
to
navigation.
it
then
gives
the
secretary
of
the
army
the
power
to
allow
exceptions
on
a
case-by-case
basis
where
structure
work
is
recommended
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
thus,
section
10
expresses
a
legislative
policy
against
the
placement
of
structures
in
navigable
waters
except
where
the
secretary
affirmatively
determines
that
the
structure
should
be
allowed.
section
10
does
not
identify
specific
factors
the
secretary
should
take
into
account
in
authorizing
such
structures.
the
secretary
accordingly
takes
into
account
a
whole
range
of
factors
relevant
to
the
public
interest
in
light
of
the
policies
congress
has
articulated
in
other
laws.
this
public
interest
review
process
is
certainly
reasonable.
nothing
in
section
10
suggests
the
army
should
exercise
its
permitting
authority
without
regard
to
the
policies
that
congress
has
stated
elsewhere.
this
court
recognized
that
point
in
united
states
v.
pennsylvania
industrial
chemical
corp.,
and
greathouse
v.
dern,
which
both
indicate
that
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
gives
the
secretary
broad
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
permits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
a
factor
that
would
be
taken
into
account
in
building
the
structure,
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
relevant
point
in
this
sense,
the
structure
might
cause
downstream
erosion,
shoreline
accretion,
which
could
result
in
actually
bringing
the
boundary
landward
and
would
affect
the
state's
grant
of
submerged
lands.
that
is
a
factor
that
the
army
will
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
issue
a
structure.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
this
disclaimer
would
in
fact
cover
that.
under
the
specific
terms
of
this
disclaimer,
much
depends
on
how
the
disclaimer
is
worded.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
this
is
only
going
to
arise
in
most
cases
with
respect
to
the
leasing
of
mineral
rights.
if
the
state
or
the
federal
government
decides
to
lease
mineral
rights,
it
will
in
fact
issue
a
notice
and
the
parties
will
contact
the
relevant
agencies,
any
party
interested
in
leasing
property,
to
locate
the
boundary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
that
is
a
practical
consequence
of
the
way
this
particular
disclaimer
is
worded.
a
disclaimer
could
eliminate
that
problem.
the
likelihood
of
the
problem
arising
is
also
minimized
by
the
fact
that
one
aspect
of
this
project
is
a
littoral
drift
monitoring
program
which
was
designed
to
assure
that
there
would
be
no
accretion
or
erosion
as
a
result
of
the
construction
of
this
structure.
the
party
that
has
the
permit
here,
the
city
of
nome,
is
under
an
obligation
to
monitor
any
such
changes,
and
if
they
do
occur,
it
is
under
an
obligation
to
prevent
them
from
occurring.
so
although
this
raises
a
theoretical
difficulty
under
this
particular
disclaimer,
i
don't
think
it
has
a
great
deal
of
practical
consequence
in
light
of
other
factors
relevant
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
those
cases
it
is
likely
not
to
because
it
does
not
affect
offshore
mineral
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right,
and
that
is
a
factor
that
the
corps
could
take
into
account.
i
am
not
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
determining
whether
to
issue
the
permit
or
not
and
what
are
the
appropriate
conditions
for
issuance
of
the
permit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
frankly,
i
am
just
not
certain
about
that
practice.
the
structure
of
the
corps'
permitting
process
is
to
take
into
account
any
factor,
any
consequence,
both
physical
or
legal,
that
might
result
from
the
addition
of
a
structure
in
navigable
waters.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
as
a
general
matter,
the
corps
attempts
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
exactly
as
in
this
case.
there
is
a
need
for
stability
with
respect
to
boundaries,
particularly
boundaries
for
submerged
lands
that
can
be
subject
to
accretion
or
erosion.
so
the
corps'
basic
perspective
on
this
is
that
we
don't
want
the
structure
to
be
altering
settled
expectations
with
respect
to
property
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
the
corps,
what
the
corps
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
stabilize
and
provide
definiteness
with
respect
to
title.
that
is
what
the
disclaimer
did
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
what
the
littoral
drift
monitoring
program
also
did
with
respect
to
this
case.
much
depends
on
how
the
disclaimer
might
be
crafted
and
in
fact,
the
army
allows
the
state
to
draft
a
disclaimer
and
then
determines
whether
or
not
the
disclaimer
would
appropriately
protect
federal
interests.
but
the
ultimate
interest
that
the
federal
government
is
asserting
here
is
in
fact
the
stability
of
title,
the
fact
that
we
do
want
to
have
certainty.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
generally
true,
although
this
is
a
matter
that
is
changing,
as
this
court
issues
particular
decrees
with
respect
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
land
would
be
ambulatory
except
that
where
disclaimers
are
in
effect
or
where
this
court
has
entered
a
decree
fixing
a
boundary.
now
that
is
always
one
alternative
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
stable
federal/state
boundary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
might
run
into
problems,
two
types
of
problems
at
the
outset.
it
could
be
an
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
corps'
power.
as
a
general
matter
it
seems,
we
would
think
that
this
disclaimer
should
be
tied
to
specific
governmental
interests
that
are
identified--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--oh,
we
do,
we
do,
and
we
exercise
that
on
a
case-by-case
basis
with
respect
to
these
individual
projects.
at
a
broader
sense,
this
seems
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
was
expressed
in
nollan
that
a
permit
condition
should
be
closely
related
to
the
reason
why
the
government
could
deny
the
permit.
now
here
we
submit
that
there
is
no
question,
that
the
government
could
deny
the
permit
based
on
the
affect
that
it
would
have
on
the
change
in
federal
property
rights.
if
it
can
deny
the
permit
on
that
basis,
it
ought
to
be
able
to
impose
conditions
that
protect
those
interests;
in
other
words,
provide
a
less
drastic
alternative.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
as
a
general
matter
that
is
a
policy
that
is
also
of
interest
to
the
army,
but
what
the
army
does
here
is
that
it
looks
to
the
consequences
of
the
building
of
the
structure.
as
it
stands
now,
the
state
has
received
exactly
those
lands
that
were
granted
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
building
of
a
structure
would
in
fact
reduce
the
united
states'
grant
of
lands
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act;
that
is
a
factor
that
the
corps
should
be
allowed
to
take
into
account.
if
the
structure
actually
went
the
in
other
direction,
if
it
actually
diminished
the
lands
that
the
state
presently
owns
with
respect
to
the
submerged
lands
act,
then
the
army
would
take
that
factor
into
account,
and
the
basis
for
that
would
be
the
policy
that
is
set
forth
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
united
states
would
not
gain
any
property
in
this
particular
case.
first
of
all,
the
united
states
grant
or
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
extends
to
the
end
of
the
outer
continental
shelf,
so
it
is
fixed...
it
is
a
geographic
matter.
in
this
case,
all
of
the
land
up
around
norton
sound
is
continental
shelf,
it
is
all
less
than
200
meters
deep.
and
this
particular
location
is
on
norton
sound.
if
you
went
south
from
nome
through
norton
sound,
you
would
eventually
hit
alaska
again.
nome
is
located
on
the
seward
peninsula.
as
a
more
general
matter,
even
if
you
had
a
straight
boundary
and
you
were
extending
the
line,
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
look
at
the
map
we
have,
the
last
page
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
effect
of
adding
a
point
on
the
coastline
is
to
create
an
are
of
additional
land
that
is
created,
that
is
encompassed
within
the
boundary.
so
although
the
causeway
only
occupies
5
acres,
it
ends
up
transferring,
if
there
were
no
disclaimer,
over
700
acres
of
land.
now
in
the
case
of
a
straight
boundary,
where
we
would
be
concerned
perhaps
with
the
200-mile
exclusive
economic
zone
limit,
this
is
another
boundary
that
we
have
that
is
apart
from
what
we
have
discussed
here,
using
the
causeway
to
extend
the
exclusive
economic
zone
could
extend
that,
but
it
would
only
be
if
it
was
an
absolutely
straight
coastline.
if
there
was
some
other
point
upstream
or
downstream
that
also
goes
out,
the
drawing
of
the
arc
would
in
fact
eliminate
the
factor
that
you
get
from
the
causeway.
now
the
secretary's
consideration
of
the
effect
of
the
proposed
structure
and
the
location
of
the
causeway
is
simply
one
part
of
its
public
interest
review
process.
as
the
secretary's
regulations
recognize,
the
location
of
the
coastline
has
great
significance
because
it
can
determine
the
location
of
international
and
federal/state
boundaries,
and
even
where
foreign
relations
concerns
are
absent,
a
shift
in
the
location
of
the
coastline
can,
as
in
this
case,
divest
the
united
states
of
its
interests
in
the
outer
continental
shelf.
congress
has
stated
that
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
a
vital
national
resource
reserve,
held
by
the
federal
government
for
the
public.
thus,
it
is
entirely
proper
for
the
secretary
to
consider,
as
one
element
of
the
public
interest
review,
the
effect
of
a
proposed
structure
on
the
location
of
the
coastline.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
review,
portions
of
a
vital
national
resource
reserve
would
be
transferred
without
any
formal
government
consideration
from
federal
to
state
hands.
the
secretary's
public
interest
review
process,
including
his
consideration
of
the
effects
of
the
proposed
structure
on
the
location
of
the
coastline,
reflects
a
commitment
to
faithful
execution
of
the
law.
it
ensures
the
secretary
takes
full
account
of
all
of
congress'
policies
before
he
authorizes
construction
that
can
impact
on
a
wide
variety
of
public
concerns.
it
is
also
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
california
ii,
which
recognized
that
the
united
states
has
the
ability
to
protect
itself
from
artificial
changes
in
the
coastline
through
its
power
over
navigable
waters.
furthermore,
it
produces
a
sensible
result.
in
this
instance,
the
city
of
nome
applied
for
a
permit
to
construct
port
facilities
projecting
more
than
1/2
mile
into
norton
sound.
the
army
learned
through
consultation
with
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
department
that
the
resulting
change
in
the
coastline
would
divest
the
united
states
of
potentially
valuable
mineral
resources.
the
army
therefore
reasonably
insisted
that
a
permit
would
not
be
issued
unless
alaska
entered
into
an
agreement
preserving
the
existing
federal/state
boundary.
the
army
was
entitled
to
deny
the
permit
because
of
the
adverse
affect
that
the
construction
would
have
on
the
location
for
the
boundary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
mineral...
the
leasing
program
that
is
ongoing
at
this
point,
and
in
fact,
request
for
leases
were
submitted,
no
bids
were
received,
but
the
primary
mineral
of
interest
in
the
case
of
those
leases
was
gold.
there
is
also
a
possibility
in
norton
sound
of
oil
and
gas,
i
think
oil
primarily.
however,
there
is
no
active
leasing
program.
there
might
be
such
a
program
in
1996.
i
also
understand
that
a
permit
has
been
issued
for
gold
prospecting
as
opposed
to
simple
leasing
for
exploration
in
the
norton
sound
area
as
well,
and
that
is
for
gold.
i
would
like
to
note
some
of
alaska's
arguments
here.
alaska
mistakenly
argues
that
section
10
limits
the
army's
inquiry
to
navigational
and
environmental
concerns.
section
10
contains
no
such
limitation
and
indeed,
suggests
a
far
broader
inquiry.
virtually
any
structure
place
in
navigable
waters
obstructs
navigation,
and
section
10
authorizes
the
secretary
to
allow
such
a
structure,
despite
the
adverse
impact.
so
obviously
the
secretary
must
look
to
factors
other
than
navigation
in
determining
whether
to
issue
a
permit.
as
alaska
concedes,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
army
can
take
into
account
the
public
interest,
including
congress'
environmental
policies,
in
determining
whether
to
issue
a
permit.
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
distinguishing
between
congress'
policies
articulated
in
environmental
laws
and
those
articulated
in
other
statutes
such
as
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
alaska
is
also
mistaken
in
arguing
that
the
result
we
urge
here
will
detract
from
this
court's
supposed
goal
of
a
single
coastline
for
international
and
domestic
purposes.
this
court
has
never
stated
that
it
has
an
overriding
goal
of
establishing
a
single
coastline.
the
court
adopted
the
coastline
definitions--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--a
single
coastline.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
alaska's
theory
here
is
that
there
should
be,
the
same
coastline
should
be
used
for
measuring
both
the
federal/state
boundary
and
international
boundaries.
and
in
fact,
there
are
divergences
that
exist
in
any
event.
as
the
court
adopted
the
definitions
in
the
international
conventions
because
they
provided
definiteness
and
stability
with
respect
to
offshore
property
rights
and
not
to
produce
a
single
coastline.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
california
ii,
a
change
in
the
international
conventions
would
not
change
the
definitions
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
occur
in
several
respects.
the
clearest
example
is
in
the
case
of
the
gulf
side
coast
of
florida
and
the
coast
of
texas.
in
the
case
of
both
of
those
states,
they
received
a
grant
of
3
marine
leagues
rather
than
3
miles
of
submerged
lands.
this
court
determined
in
united
states
v.
louisiana
that
the
coastline
for
the
purpose
of
that
grant
would
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
coastline
at
the
time
of
admission
and
would
not
include
any
subsequent
artificial
structures.
more
recently,
we
stipulated
to
a
coastline,
a
baseline
for
the
purposes
of
closing
the
chandeleur
sound
off
the
coast
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
that
baseline
also
was
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
baseline
that
would
be
established
for
international
purposes.
alaska
is
also
mistaken
in
arguing
that
california
ii's
discussion
of
the
united
states'
control
over
navigable
waters
was
made
in
reference
to
congress'
constitutional
power
over
navigation
rather
than
the
army's
permitting
authority.
the
court's
reference
to
the
government's
power
to
resolve
future
disputes
by
agreement
can
refer
only
to
an
executive
power.
congress
enacts
laws.
it
does
not
enter
into
agreements.
and
the
special
master's
statements,
which
this
court
cited
with
approval,
expressly
refer
to
the
government's
permitting
process
and
the
need
for
governmental
approval.
in
sum,
we
believe
that
the
army
has
the
authority
to
require
this
sort
of
disclaimer
in
these
circumstances,
and
we
therefore
request
that
the
court
grant
the
united
states
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
follow.
i
suppose...
under
our
theory
it
would,
it
seems
to
me,
to
us,
that
if
we
have
the
power
to
deny
the
permit,
we
have
the
power
to
condition
it.
i
think
it
would
be
unusual
if
we
had
the
power
to
condition
it,
but
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
that
is
a
last...
maybe
i
am
getting
confused
here,
but
our
theory
is
that
we
can
deny
the
permit
based
on
its
coastline--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
if
we
can't,
then
i
believe
that
the
logic
of
our
position
would
be
that
we
would
have
to
grant
the
permit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
a
few
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
what
the
army
corps
of
engineers
is
faced
with
in
these
circumstances,
and
it
is
a
very
practical
problem.
structures
are
built
or
parties
apply
to
build
structures
in
navigable
waters,
and
what
the
army
corps
of
engineers
does
is
attempt
to
evaluate
all
of
the
consequences
of
placing
that
structure
in
the
water,
both
the
physical
and
legal.
one
of
the
consequences
can
be
a
change
in
the
boundary
and
what
the
army
attempts
to
do
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
now
by
keeping
the
boundary
at
the
same
location,
that
really
serves
the
purposes
of
both
acts
here,
both
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
if
gives
effect
to
both
of
those
statutes
because
both
parties
get
what
they
had
originally
planned
on
receiving.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
first,
with
respect
to
the
notion,
the
questions
concerning
the
ambulatory
nature
of
the
boundary.
congress
has
never
stated
in
the
submerged
lands
act
that
the
boundary
is
ambulatory.
that
was
this
court's
interpretation
in
california
ii,
the
same
decision
in
which
this
court
recognized
that
the
united
states
could
reach
agreement
about
these
matters.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
the
same
case
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
the
united
states
could
reach
agreements
about
these
matters,
california
ii.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
boundary
is
ambulatory,
the
congress
did
not
state
that
policy;
rather,
the
court
adopted
that
policy
in
california
ii.
subsequently,
congress
provided
an
avenue
for
fixing
the
boundaries
in
the
submerged
lands
act
in
section
1301(b).
it
provides
that
boundaries
can
now
be
fixed
by
decree
of
this
court.
but
more
importantly,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
it
will
be
fixed.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recall
that
the
question
at
stake
here
really
is
title
to
these
submerged
lands
and
to
the
mineral
resources.
as
far
as
the
uncertainty
that
might
exist
because
of
disclaimers,
that
is
rectified
simply
by
a
party
who
is
interested
in
obtaining
a
lease,
checking
with
the
appropriate
governmental
authority
for
the
location
of
the
boundary.
you
perform
a
title
search
in
the
same
way
that
you
would
assert
in
any
other
type
of
real
estate,
and
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
that.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
raised
at
the
outset
about
the
accretion
from
the
natural
structure
or
from
the
artificial
structure,
i
have
been
informed
there
is
case
law
in
the
states
that
indicates
that
once
an
artificial
structure
is
built
in
a
navigable
river,
the
subsequent
accretion
and
erosion
does
not
change
the
boundary
if
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
building
of
the
structure.
perhaps
that
same
principle
would
apply
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
the
boundary,
the
coastline
situation.
i
don't
think
we
have
any
cases
on
that
with
respect
to
federal--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--not
necessarily.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
refers
to
harbor
works.
a
dock
that
does
not
have
a
low
water
mark
would
not
affect
a
change
in
the
coastline
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
was
decided
in
california
iii.
so
we
are
talking
about
primarily
very
large
structures,
causeways,
other
major
buildings
that
will
have
a
significant
effect,
and
in
fact,
our
records
indicate
there
have
been
about
17
instances
since
1970
where
this
problem
has
arisen.
now
with
respect
to
justice
stevens'
observation
that
the
state
could
build
a
structure
simply
to
obtain
offshore
lands,
imagine
that
consequence
in
the
case
of
prudhoe
bay
for
instance,
where
there
are
very
valuable
known
mineral
resources
that
are
located
there.
this
could
result,
and
again,
without
any
formal
government
consideration,
of
a
massive
transfer
of
valuable
mineral
resources.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
perhaps,
but
i
don't
think
congress
should
be
forced
to
act
on
these
matters
when
we
have
an
expert
agency
that
can
in
fact
deal
with
these
problems.
also
take
into
account
the
situation,
if
there
were
leases
in
effect
offshore
of
nome,
if
we
had
actually
leased
that
property,
the
extension
of
the
boundary
would
make
those
leaseholders
good
faith
trespassers
and
could
put
their
interests
at
risk.
there
is
a
very
strong
interest
here
in
maintaining
a
federal/state
boundary
and
not
having
it
change
by
artificial
structures.
that
serves
both
the
federal
government's
interests
and
the
states'
government's
interests,
and
we
think
this
court
should
recognize
and
uphold
that
principle
and
grant
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
we
should
have
the
power
to
turn
down
the
permit,
yes.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--even
if
we
can't
condition
it.
it
seems
illogical
to
say
that
we
couldn't
condition
it,
i
suppose
that
is
where
the
problem
really
is.
as
long
as
the
condition
applies
with
the
rationale
in
nollan,
we
should
be
able
to
impose
conditions
that
offer
a
less
drastic
alternative
to
outright
prohibition.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
