justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
the
submerged
land
act
expressly
states
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
the
states
to
have
title
to
submerged
lands
within
3
miles
of
their
coastline.
does
that
statutory
articulation
of
public
interest
affect
the
resolution
of
this
case,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
logic
of
your
position,
mr.
gissberg,
is
that
assuming
a
particular
project
does
not
interfere
with
navigation,
that
the
federal
government
is
powerless
to
prevent
a
state
from
artificially
extending
its
coastline
for
the
very
purpose
of
gaining
title
to
submerged
lands
in
some
valuable
area.
i
mean,
that
is
the
logic
of
your
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
do
i
understand
that
the
policy
of
the
corps
of
engineers
now
would
be
that
even
if
a
private
landowner
wanted
to
repair
or
construct
a
dock
on
the
shoreline,
that
permission
would
be
given
only
if
the
state
in
which
it
is
located
executes
some
kind
of
waiver?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
universal
policy
to
be
followed
now
by
the
corps?
