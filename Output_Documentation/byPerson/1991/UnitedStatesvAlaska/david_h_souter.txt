mr.
gissberg,
has
congress
given
you
or
given
the
state
of
alaska
the
statutory
authority
to
alienate
what
it
might
get
under
this
theory
of
3
miles
ambulatory
boundary?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
state
law
allowed
you
to
do
it,
is
there
anything
in
the
submerged
lands
act
which
precludes
your
alienation
for
some
other
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
argument
is
strictly
that
the
corps
does
not
have
the
power
to
require
and
not
that
you
do
not
have
the
power
under
federal
law
to
alienate?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
claim
that
if
you
entered
into
the
agreement,
if
for
example
you
and
the
federal
government
said,
look,
we
will
agree
to
disagree
as
to
whether
we
get
this
for
an
instant
or
not,
and
you
simply
entered
into
an
agreement
which
you
requested,
not
a
condition
of
the
approval,
you
requested
to
enter
into
this
agreement.
do
you
claim
that
the
agreement
would
not
be
a
valid
agreement
and
a
binding
alienation,
in
light
of
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
all
you
are
really
saying
is,
we
just
wouldn't
do
it
unless
they
will
salve
our
lust
for
title
by
agreeing
that
we
get
it
for
at
least
an
instant,
we
simply
wouldn't
agree,
but
you
admit
you
could
agree
and
that
the
answer
to
justice
white's
question
is,
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
nome
could
end
up
building
its
causeway
anyway
after
we
had
agreed
voluntarily
to
alienate
what
we
claim
we
had.
