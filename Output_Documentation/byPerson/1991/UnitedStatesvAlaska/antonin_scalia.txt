mr.
minear,
can
i
ask,
what
is
the
government's
position
under
section
10
and
under
this
waiver
or
for
that
matter,
under
all
waivers,
with
respect
to
a
natural
accretion
that
is
caused
by
the
construction
of
the
artificial
structure?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
talking
about
whether
the
army
will
take
it
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
issue
the
permit.
i
am
sure
it
will.
but
suppose
the
permit
is
issued
subject
to
a
waiver
such
as
this;
does
the
waiver
include
the
state's
power
over
any
extension
of
the
state's
boundary
caused
by
natural
accretion
which
is
in
turn
attributable
to
the
artificial
structure?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
go
and
figure
out
how
much
natural
accretion
along
the
shoreline
is
caused
by
the
construction
of
a
jetty
that
was
subject
to
a
waiver
like
this?
it
makes
it
awful
complicated,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
is
the
case
that
i
just
can't
look
at
the
shoreline
and
say,
well,
except
for
natural
structures,
i
know
that
the
3-mile
is
measured
from
the
shoreline
and
you
are
telling
me
that
if
some
of
that
shoreline
may
be
up-current
or
down-current,
i
don't
know
how
accretion
works,
has
been
altered
by
reason
of
the
artificial
structure,
i
cannot
count
that
part
of
the
shoreline
for
determining
the
3-mile
limit.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
structure...
the
point
of
my
earlier
question,
mr.
minear,
is
that
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
the
government
that
section
10
allows
you
to
take
into
account
whether
it
will
alter
the
ownership
of
submerged
lands,
but
to
say
that
you
can
take
it
into
account
is
not
to
say
that
can
condition
the
permission
upon
this
kind
of
waiver.
the
greater
does
not
necessarily
include
the
lesser.
and
if
indeed
one
of
the
consequences
of
having
these
waivers
is
that
the
shoreline
is
always
going
to
be
subject
to
debate
as
to
whether
some
natural
accretion
has
occurred
by
reason
of
an
artificial
structure
under
such
a
waiver,
i
am
more
inclined
to
think
that
your
choice
is
either
to
let
it
go
forward
in
which
case
the
coast
is
altered
as
the
structure
causes,
or
else,
not
let
it
go
forward.
why
isn't
that
a
conceivable
version
of
section
10?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
doesn't
end
up
with
any
net
loss,
right?
it
loses
the
length
of
the
structure
at
one
end
and
picks
it
up
at
the
other
end.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
divergences
that
occur
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
preserving
the
property
of
the
united
states
is
one
of
the
public
interests
of
the
united
states?
does
that
mean
the
department
of
the
interior
does
not?
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
special
statute
that
says
the
secretary
shall
evict
people
who
poach
on
united
states
lands,
but
i
am
sure
it
is
part
of
the
public
interest
of
the
united
states
to
preserve
territory
owned
by
the
united
states.
isn't
that
self-evident?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
submerged
lands
act
doesn't
say
that
the
effect
of
structures
can
be
to
decrease
the
territory
owned
by
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
not
talking
now
about
the
waiver.
we
are
talking
about
the
right
to
refuse.
i
agree
that
if
the
government
gives
a
waiver,
you
can
argue
that
that
contradicts
the
submerged
lands
act
because
it
causes
the
state
to
own
less
than
the
3
miles.
but
i
am
just
now
talking
about
the
government's
simple
right
to
refuse.
you
want
to
build
a
structure,
the
government
says...
i
am
not
contravening
the
submerged
lands
act.
i
am
not
saying
you
can
build
it,
but
you
can't
have
your
3
miles,
i
am
just
saying,
you
can't
build
it
because
it
will
take
away
territory
of
the
united
states.
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
once
you
acknowledge
that
all
interests,
all
governmental
interests
and
not
just
the
interest
in
navigation
can
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
deny
the
permit,
i
cannot
imagine
that
one
of
those
interests
cannot
be
whether
the
federal
government
will
lose
territory.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
an
obvious
governmental
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
can
pass
a
statute...
i
mean,
if
that
happens...
that
is
not
something
that
the
federal
government
is
disempowered
from
preventing.
you
are
just
saying
that
under
the
current
statute
it
couldn't
be
prevented,
but
as
soon
as
somebody
tried
it,
you
would
get
a
statute
pretty
quickly,
don't
you
think?
