now,
mr.
minear,
i
take
it
that
if
there
is
accretion
or
erosion
through
natural
causes,
the
boundary
is
ambulatory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
absent
the
decree,
the
government
agrees
that
the
land
would
be
ambulatory
in
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
have
authority,
would
the
government
have
authority
to
tell
alaska
that
it's
going
to
condition
the
permit
for
construction
of
this
structure
on
making
the
entire
boundary
of
alaska
fixed
as
of
this
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
said
you
had
a
governmental
interest
in
having
stable
boundaries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
any
governmental
entity
which
is
the
restriction
you
mentioned
in
your
anti-alienation
statutes
include
a
grant
to
the
government
of
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
that
is
true,
if
your
counsel
had
said,
you
know,
this
is
a
difficult
area
of
interpretation
and
you
had
offered
initially
to
waive,
the
government
could
have
entered
a
contract
with
you
to
waive
the
extension
of
the
boundary,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
if
the
rights
of
the
parties
are
in
doubt,
i
can't
see
why
that
isn't
also
a
ground
for
the
government
to
insist
on
the
contract,
simply
to
avoid
litigation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
think
reasonable
people
could
disagree
on
that
proposition?
