justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
118
original,
united
states
against
alaska.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
corps
exact
similar
waivers
in
connection
with
structures
on
a
river?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
could
very
much
affect
the
boundary
between
one
state
and
another
on
a
river.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
factor,
a
factor
the
corps
could
take
into
account?
take
into
account
in
doing
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
the
corps
does
not
generally
exact
waivers
in
connection
with
streams
or
rivers
within
the
united
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
a
state
applies
to
build
a
dam
on
a
river
and
the
river
is
on
an
interstate
boundary
and
the
prospectus
or
study
says
there
is
a
chance
that
there
will
be
some
erosion
on
one
side
of
the
river,
accretion
on
the
other
and
it
might
alter
the
boundary
of
the
state
some,
how
would
the
court
take
that
into
consideration?
would
that
be
a
negative
or
a
positive
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
upholding
a
what
kind
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
opposed
to
what,
a
double
coastline?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
gissberg,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gissberg,
could
the
corps
of
engineers
have
said
when
you
applied
for
a
permit,
it
looks
to
us
as
if
this
is
going
to
extend
the
state's
seaward
boundary,
therefore
we
are
going
to
turn
it
down.
we
are
going
to
say
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
isn't...
let's
assume
you
are
correct
about
the
formula,
why
can't
the
united
states
or
the
corps
of
engineers
simply
say,
we
don't
want
to
risk
any
changes
in
the
outer
boundary,
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
build
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course
it
is,
but
that
doesn't
answer
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
says
you
can't
build
any
structure
in
navigable
waters
except
on
plans
recommended
by
the
chief
of
engineers
and
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
the
army.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
factors
can
the
secretary
take
into
consideration
in
refusing
to
authorize
a
construction
project?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
is
disputing
that,
i
don't
think,
mr.
gissberg.
the
question
is,
what
factors
can
they
take
into
consideration
under
the
laws
that
exist?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
question
then
the
authority
of
congress
to
explicitly
adopt
a
regime
such
as
the
corps
has
adopted
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
concede
that
congress
does
have
that
authority
had
it
chosen
to
do
so,
you
say
it
has.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state
of
alaska
can
always
say
to
nome,
if
they
really
don't
approve
of
the
project,
nome,
we
won't
grant
any
waiver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
any
rate,
the
state
of
alaska
is
not
the
prisoner
of
nome's
desires
for
a
long
causeway.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gissberg.
mr.
minear,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
stability
isn't
the
law
of
the
boundary,
i
don't
really
see
much
to
that
point,
mr.
minear.
if
the
law
says
that
the
boundary
changes
when
the
land
form
changes,
to
say
that
we
are
going
to
exact
waivers
so
that
that
principle
doesn't
come
into
operation,
i
don't
see
it
as
much
of
a
principle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
pull
the
lectern
up
a
little
bit.
i
have
a
hard
time
hearing
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
