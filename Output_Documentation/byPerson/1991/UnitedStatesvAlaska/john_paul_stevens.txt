yes,
but
may
i
interrupt
there.
i
don't
see
why
under
your
theory
that
the
state
must
have
a
navigational
purpose.
why
couldn't
the
state
under
your
theory
decide,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
they
would
like
a
little
more
territory
and
if
they
found
an
area
in
which
there
is
no
navigational
problem
and
no
environmental
problem,
would
just
build
a
jetty
out
for
2
miles
for
the
express
and
sole
purpose
of
getting
more
territory.
it
seems
to
me
under
your
theory
they
could
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
a
correct
summary
of
your
theory?
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul

but
my
hypothetical
is
that
it
is
neutral
on
navigation,
it
is
either
high
enough
so
the
ships
can
go
under
or
something,
but
assuming
my
hypothetical
has
absolutely
no
impact
on
either
navigation
or
environment,
it
is
just
a
way
of
acquiring
territory,
sticking
a
10-mile
jetty
out
into
the
ocean,
that
you
could
do,
i
think
under
your
theory
because
congress
hasn't
thought
about
the
problem
and--
