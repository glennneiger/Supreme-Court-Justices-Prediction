the
problem
is
that
if
you
don't
have
the
power
to
condition,
that
you
wouldn't
have
the
power
to
refuse
this
permit?

if
you
don't
have
the
power
to
condition,
you
don't
have
the
power
to
refuse
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
it
otherwise
satisfies
the...
if
the
only
objection
you
would
have
is
because
it
extends
the
coastline,
you
couldn't
refuse
it
under
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know.
but
what
if
you
can't?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
isn't
it
alaska's
position
that
you
have
no
power
here
to
refuse
the
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
your
position
went
farther
than
that,
that
whether
or
not
it
extends
the
coastline
or
extends
a
state
line,
the
boundary,
whether
or
not
it
does
it
not
a
proper
consideration
in
determining
whether
to
issue
the
permit
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
go
ahead.
justice

suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you
in
that
regard,
mr.
attorney
general;
suppose
the
government
just
turns
you
down?
we
say
that
the
government
has
the
power
and
the
government
just
turns
you
down.
do
you
think
that
if
you
then
went
to
the
government
and
said,
look,
we
want
this
pier.
we
offer
to
waive
any
change
in
the
coastline
if
you
grant
this
permit.
and
the
government
says,
well,
we
don't
condition
it
on
that,
but
we
will
just
make
a
contract
about
it.
do
you
think
that
would
be
enforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
we
say
that
they
have
authority
to
turn...
say
that
they
have
the
authority
to
turn
the
permit
down
and
you
think
then
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
state
and
the
federal
government
could
make
an
agreement
that
would
permit
the
building
of
the
pier
without
extending
the
coastline.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
that
statement
in
one
of
the
california
cases
that
the
united
states
could
protect
itself
was
just
misguided?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
it
protect
itself
if
it
must
issue
the
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
particular
jetty
could
have
been
twice
as
long.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
the
federal
government
would
have
to
issue
the
permit.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
however
that
we
say
that
the
corps
may
turn
down
the
permit
because
of
boundary
considerations,
but
that
it
cannot
condition...
impose
the
condition.
let's
assume
that
that
is
logically
consistent
and
legally
consistent.
is
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
you
don't
think
there
is
any
way
that
the
state
then
may
arrange
with
the
government
to
build
the
causeway
and
not
change
the
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
turn
down
the
permit,
but
they
can't
it
and
condition
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
let's
forget
about
congress.
there
wouldn't
be
any
way
for
the
government
and
the
state
to
issue
the
permit
and
not
have
the
boundary
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
it
would
not
change
thereafter?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
how
much
erosion?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
want
to
change
your
answer
to
my
question,
just
before
you
saw
down
before
or
not?
whether
if
you
don't
have
the
power
to
condition,
you
don't
have
the
power
to
turn
the
permit
down.
justice

even
if
you
can't
condition
it?

the
second
case,
united
states
against
alaska,
arises
under
our
original
jurisdiction,
and
it
involves
issues
about
the
offshore
boundary
of
the
state
of
alaska.
the
united
states
and
the
state
have
filed
a
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
case
was
briefed
and
argued.
and
as
we
will
declare
from
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
grant
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
filed
by
the
united
states
and
deny
the
similar
motion
by
the
state.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
