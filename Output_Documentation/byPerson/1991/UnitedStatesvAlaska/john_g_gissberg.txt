mr.
john
g.
gissberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
army
corps'
disclaimer
practice
is
open-ended
and
mandatory
and
missing
the
essence
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
also
some
fundamental
principles
of
government
in
this
country.
this
causes
them
to
badly
misjudge
the
public
interest
in
both
law
and
in
fact.
we
don't
believe
that
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
or
the
rivers
and
harbors
appropriation
act
of
1899
causes
any
other
result.
in
essence,
this
is
simply
a
case
of
statutory
construction,
whether
the
army
has
the
statutory
authority
to
require
a
disclaimer
that
fixes
a
state's
seaward
boundary
at
a
line
that
is
different
from
the
3
miles
from
the
coastline
that
was
granted
to
the
states
by
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
this
is
correct.
my
next
sentence
is
getting
to
that
point.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
but
we
start
with
the
coastline
and
i
also
want
to
emphasize
that
alaska,
although
we
were
not
a
state
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
under
our
statehood
compact
we
did
become
a
state,
specifically
that
compact
provides
us
the
benefits
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
congress,
in
enacting
that
submerged
lands
act,
spoke
directly
and
clearly
and
couldn't
have
spoken
more
plainly
that
the
states
own
submerged
lands
to
3
miles
from
the
coastline.
they
knew
then,
as
has
been
known
from
the
beginning
of
time,
that
coastlines
are
not
stable.
they
change
through
all
sorts
of
natural
forces
and
manmade
modifications.
under
acts
of
congress
and
international
law
that
has
been
adopted
by
this
court,
the
rule
is
that
those
ambulations
of
the
coastline
result
in
corresponding
changes
to
the
seaward
boundary,
wherever
that
is
and
whatever
seaward
boundary
it
happens
to
be.
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
the
3-mile
limit,
but
the
same
consequence
happens
on
the
12-mile
federal
territorial
sea
and
on
the
200-mile
exclusive
economic
zone
that
the
federal
government
has.
this
is
a
fact
of
life
on
the
ocean
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
cannot
change
that
by
administrative
fiat.
by
doing
this
administratively
and
venting
their
own
exception
to
this
rule
that
congress
laid
down,
they
are
absolutely
ignoring
the
submerged
lands
act,
which
is
the
one
single
act
that
directly,
squarely
addresses
the
states'
rights
to
submerged
lands.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
mr.
chief
justice,
absolutely
not.
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
state
didn't
apply
for
the
permit,
and
about
a
year
later
we
got
a
letter
saying
that
nome
wasn't
going
to
get
the
permit
unless
the
state
waived
it.
no,
they
do
not
have
that
authority.
congress
spoke
clearly
that
this
is
an
ambulatory
formula.
we
have
a
fixed
formula.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
because
the
army
corps
is
a
creature
of
congress,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--my
answer
is
that
they
only
have
the
power
that
congress
gave
them
and
that
power
starts
from
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
compares
section
10,
which
the
court
has
just
read,
to
section
13,
which
they
reference
in
pennsylvania
chemical
case,
and
we
think...
and
pennsylvania
chemical
said
that
regarding
putting
pollutants
into
navigable
waters,
the
army
corps
had
discretion
to
say
no,
they
will
not
allow
those
pollutants
to
go
in.
we
don't
believe
they
have
that
same
discretion
under
article
10
and
here
is
why.
article
10
was
developed
for
completely
different
reasons
than
article
13.
article
13
is
to
protect
those
waters
from
something
that
is
bad,
pollution.
article
10
is
to
do
something
good
to
those
waters,
to
enhance
the
navigable
capacity.
in
1888
in
the
willamette
case,
the
courts
of
the
united
states
said
that
there
is
no
prohibition
of
putting
any
single
obstruction
in
navigable
waters
in
the
united
states.
so
in
1890
the
congress
enacted
the
precursor
of
this
rivers
and
harbors
appropriation
act
of
1899.
they
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
enhance
navigation.
as
a
part
of
that,
they
told
the
army
corps
of
engineers
that
there
will
be
no
obstructions
to
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
when
the
army
corps
of
engineers
takes
that
authority
and
says
this
means
that
from
1899
to
the
present
day,
we
could
say
that
nobody
will
build
a
pier,
nobody
will
build
a
wharf,
nobody
will
build
a
causeway,
nobody
can
do
anything
in
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
what
article
10
says.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
1899
until
1968,
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
by
their
own
admission
in
the
federal
register
cite
that
the
government
has
put
in,
took
into
account
one
factor,
and
that
was
navigation,
enhancing
navigation.
if
a
project
enhanced
navigation
they
accounted
for
that.
in
the
1960s
and
'70s,
there
is
a
series
of
cases
saying
that
the
army
corps
of
engineers
is
allowing
things
to
happen
that
are
destructive
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
army
corps
of
engineers
can
only
consider
public
interest
that
is
articulated
by
congress.
the
first
time
this
happened
was
in
1956
in
the
fish
and
wildlife
coordination
act.
in
the
fish
and
wildlife
coordination
act,
the
army
corps
could
say,
this
project
is
good
for
navigation,
but
it
is
not
good
for
anadromous
fish,
so
therefore
we
are
not
going
to
put
it
in.
then
in
1969,
the
national
environmental
protection
act
was
passed.
before
that
though,
the
most
important
one
was
that
in
1953,
the
congress
looked
at
the
ownership
of
submerged
lands
offshore
and
they
said
the
states
are
going
to
have
it
to
3
miles
from
the
coastline.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
would
be
if
it
were
not
for
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
submerged
lands
act
is
the
only
act
that
congress
has
directed
specifically
to
tell
us
what
happens
with
submerged
lands.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
the
submerged
lands
act,
justice
scalia,
says
that
the
states
will
own
the
lands
to
3
miles
from
the
coastline,
that
coastline
is
ambulatory.
everybody
knows
it
changes.
so
the
federal--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--the
problem
with
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
congress
addressed
those
federal
interests
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
may
of
1953
when
they
enacted
the
submerged
lands
act
and
then
in
august
when
they
enacted
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
and
they
realized
there
would
be
some
changes
in
that
baseline.
actually,
when
they
enacted
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
took
all
of
the
federal
lands
and
all
36,000
square
miles
of
the
3-mile
limit
and
gave
it
to
the
states.
there
was
an
immense
national
interest
in
those
lands.
we
are
talking
about
730
acres
that
doesn't
have
anything
on
it
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
and
we
are
saying
that
that
is
going
to
be
subverted
by
an
army
corps
decision
that
that
is
in
the
public
interest.
i
don't
think
we
can
do
it.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
justice
scalia,
it
somehow
isn't
as
obvious
to
me
because
i
have
looked
exactly
at
what
congress
has
said,
and
in
our
briefs
we
have
gone
through,
there
are
probably
20
different
laws
of
congress
that
have
been
enacted
that
the
army
corps
of
engineers
has
to
look
at.
one
of
those
says
that
that
coastline
is
ambulatory,
natural
or
artificial
causes,
it
moves
in
and
out.
now
the
hypothetical
that
the
court
is
raising
is
one
where
we
are
not
talking
about
a
waiver.
we
are
just
saying
that
they
can't
issue
that
permit.
i
believe
that
once
they
accept
the
permit
application,
once
the
permit
application
is
given
to
them,
that
they
are
bound
to
act
on
that
permit
application
in
accordance
with
the
laws.
if
i
go
to
the
federal
government
for
a
fishing
license
and
i
am
qualified
for
the
fishing
license
or
a
driver's
license
or
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
they
can't...
of
course,
they
have
authority
to
issue
those
permits,
but
it
is
not
in
their
discretion.
look
at
article--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
in
the
1968
cite
to
the
federal
register,
the
corps
admits
there
that
we
are
now
going
to
take
into
account
more
factors
than
just
navigation.
they
list
a
long
variety
of
laws
there
that
they
can
take
into
account.
every
single
one
of
those
factors
in
their
public
interest
review,
if
the
court
will
compare
their
regulations
at
33
cfr
320
to
the
statutory
authority
that
they
list,
every
single
one
of
those
regulatory
criteria
that
they
compare
with
is
related
to
an
act
of
congress
except
this
one,
and
except
the
ownership
one.
and
the
only
thing
that
is
related
to
the
ownership
one
is
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
fact,
in
their
own
law,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
submerged
lands
act,
in
their
own
regulations
in
320,
it
says
property
interests
will
not
be
a
factor.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
no,
i
don't.
i
think
the
army
corps
has
to
have
the
authority
to
do
that
from
congress,
and
that
is
what
this
court
was
talking
about
in--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--i
see.
from
my
point
of
view,
i
would
require
an
act
of
congress
that
said
that
there
will
be
no...
nothing
done
to
the
coastline
that
affects
the
state
seaward
boundary,
and
then
i
would
say,
yes,
that
is
giving
them
that
as
some
authority.
now
i
would
think
that
congress
would
definitely
not
do
that.
they
would
give
the
court
some
formula
to
weigh
the
public
interest,
maybe
the
$25
million
causeway
and
17
acres
that
are
covered
up
and
the
boats
that
come
in
and
the
good
that
is
done
for
the
city
of
nome
and
northwest
alaska
would
be
a
part
of
that.
i
think
it
would
be
if
congress
did
it.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
this
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
job
of
congress
to
do--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--absolutely,
and
in
fact,
we
interpret
the
court's
suggestion
that
is
being
taken
as
a
mandatory
direction
now
because
this
is
happening
on
every
single
causeway
and
every
single
beach
project...
we
only
could
find
17
through
1991,
but
every
one
that
is
coming
up
now,
the
corps
requires
these
disclaimers.
in
this
court
in
1965,
in
the
second
california
case
said
that
there
could
be
legislation
and
agreements
to
do
this.
that
is
what
has
to
be
done
before
the
court
has
this
authority.
they
can't
substitute
their
judgment
for
congress.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
not
at
all,
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
read--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--justice
white,
that
statement
in
the
california
case
specifically
says
it
can
protect
itself
through
its
authority...
powers
over
navigation.
that
is
the
navigational
servitude,
plus
its
authority
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
appropriation
act
to
allow
or
disallow
projects
that
interfere
with
the
navigable
capacity--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--this
court
has
actually
said,
i
have
been
looking
at
the
second
half
of
that
sentence
in
california
ii,
but
this
court
in
california
ii
said
that...
they
directly
addressed
that
to
unwarranted
structures,
and
an
unwarranted
structure
would
be
one
that
doesn't
have
any
navigational
benefit
or
any
other
benefit
under
the
laws
of
congress.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
well,
i
think
actually
under
what
this
court
may
have
said,
that
they
can
do
that.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
let
me
clarify
that,
justice
stevens,
because
this
court
has
said
that
unwarranted
structures
may
be
suspect,
and
unwarranted
though
in
terms
of
navigation.
so
if
a
structure
is
being
put
up
just
for
the
sole
purpose
to
extend
the
state's
land,
i
believe
that
the
laws
that
we
are
now
operating
under
do
not
allow
the
army
corps
of
engineers
to
turn
that
down
if
it
has
any
navigational
purpose.
but
the--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--it
was
supposed
to
be,
but
it
took
too
long
to
finish.
yes,
of
course,
it
could
have
been.
it
could
have
been
10
miles
long.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
i
would
say
that
the
federal
government
would
not
be
able
to
deny
the
permit
on
the
basis
of
changes
in
the
ambulatory
boundary.
if
a
20-mile
long
causeway
serves
1
percent
more
of
the
navigational
benefit
than
a
2
mile
causeway
and
the
interference
to
navigation
because
of
the
extra
8
miles
is
substantial,
that
is
the
judgment
call
that
they
have
to
make.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
they
haven't--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--justice
stevens,
they
haven't
thought
about
the
problem,
but
this
court
has
thought
about
the
problem
in
two
cases.
one
of
them
is
the
california
ii
case
in
'65,
where
this
court
said
that
unwarranted
structures
could
be
addressed
by
the
parties.
the
second
one,
though,
is
the
texas
boundary
case
which
is
cited
in
the
plaintiff's
reply
brief
at
page
11
and
it
is
not
cited
for
that
proposition,
but
in
that
case,
the
court,
this
court
said
that...
they
were
talking
about
a
change
that
would
let
the
state
of
texas
have
a...
would
get
some
extra
mineral
land.
and
this
court
said
that,
quote,
any
alleged
inequitable
treatment
and
detriment
to
the
orderly
mineral
development
by
allowing
ambulations
must
be
resolved
by
looking
to
congress
for
relief.
and
we
believe
that
is
exactly
what
is
done
here.
the
corps
of
engineers
is
not
going
to
congress
for
this
authority.
they
are
inventing
this
authority
on
their
own
and
they
don't...
congress
hasn't
given
them
the
statutory
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
justice
souter,
our
state's
3-mile
limit
lands
are
subject
to
a
public
trust
doctrine,
and
under
our
state
constitution
and
state
law,
we
may
not
alienate
those
properties
except
to
another
governmental
entity,
for
example,
the
city
of
nome.
we
did
in
fact
give
17
acres
to
the
city
of
nome
to
build
the
causeway.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
no,
justice
souter,
because
the
submerged
lands
act
in
opposition
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
states
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
grant
to
the
states
title
to
and
ownership
of
the
submerged
lands.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
the
federal
law
does
not
affect
the
state's
right
to
alienate.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
justice
kennedy,
we
could
grant
to
the
united
states,
to
a
city,
a
municipality,
any
governmental
agency.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
it
would
have
been
our
property
and
we
would
have
had
title
and
ownership
to
it
and
i
think
we
could
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
them.
let's
say
for
some
reason
the
government
did
need
that
property,
the
navy
is
going
to
build
a
base
or
there
is
some
fish
spotting
device
out
there
run
by
the
national
marine
fisheries
service,
and
they
need
it.
i
think
it
becomes
our
property,
the
730
acres,
we
could
trade
it
for
property
someplace
down
the
beach
or--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--i
think
that
is
probably
true,
justice
kennedy,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
rights
of
the
parties
are
in
any
doubt
at
all.
we
believe
the
submerged
lands
act
squarely
this
addresses
this
issue
and
is
absolutely
clear.
it
says
that
the
states
get
3
miles
from
an
ambulatory
baseline--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--well,
i
certainly
do
not
disagree
with
what
justice
kennedy
has
said.
we
have
talked
about
this
in
some
detail.
this
is
not
just
affecting
the
state
of
alaska.
it
is
not
just
affecting
the
nome
causeway.
the
city
of
nome
happened
to
apply
for
this
particular
coastal
construction
project.
the
corps
of
engineers
permits
projects
on
the
coasts
of
the
united
states
all
over
the
country.
we
found
12
with
disclaimers
so
far.
we
now
have
evidence
from
their...
they
have
an
internal
guidance
that
has
just
come
out
in
which
they
say
that
the
district
engineer,
whenever
there
is
a
project
that
may
effect
the
baseline
will
request
a
waiver
from
the
affected
state.
so
this
is
not
going
to
be
subject
to
any
kind
of
an
agreement
anymore.
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
courts
suggestion
to
us
in
california
ii.
they
said
we
could
talk
about
this
through
legislation
or
agreement.
but
the
state
of
alaska
is
over
here,
the
city
of
nome
applies
for
the
permit
to
the
army.
a
year
later
the
army
writes
the
city
of
nome
and
the
state
of
alaska
a
letter
in
july
of
1983
saying
we
are
not
going
to
give
this
permit
unless
the
state
waives
its
claims
out
here.
that
is
not
an
agreement.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
justice
white,
is
the
example
that
they
can,
they
can
turn
down...
they
don't
have
to
give
the
permit,
but
they
can
condition--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--okay,
i
understand.
in
that
case,
and
if
congress
gave
them
that
authority--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--justice
white,
i
think
if
the
government
would
recognize
that
maybe
for
an
instant
that
becomes
our
property
then
we
can
clearly
enter
into
an
agreement
with
it,
but
that
would
take
a
fundamental
step
for
them
to
take
that
they
haven't
taken
yet.
so
we
would
not
enter
into
an
agreement
about
something
that
they
won't
let
us
own.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
i
think
that
it
would
be.
we
would
have
to
interpret
the
rights
to
the
730
acres
in
one
way,
even
though
they
would
disagree.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
well,
we
sure
wouldn't
do
it
voluntarily.
nome
would
have
to
pay
us
something
for
giving
them...
it
would
be
kind
of
complicated.
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
we
don't
want
it...
yes,
it
would,
and
that
is
the
problem,
there
are
a
lot
of
projects
in
the
state
of
alaska,
this
isn't
just
the
city
of
nome
that
is
doing
it.
it
is
private
people
that
have
things
they
might
want
to
put
out
there
and
the
state
of
alaska
now
has
a
veto
power
over
it.
let
the
army
corps
of
engineers
get
a
permit
from
the
navy
to
build
a
causeway
down
in
adak
and
ask
us
for
a
waiver
and
maybe
we
will
balance
that
off
against
the
nome
waiver.
but
this
is
the
problem
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
it
is
open-ended.
there
is
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
it.
it
is
something
that
the
corps
of
engineers
has
invented--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--the
state
of
alaska,
under
what
the
army
corps
of
engineers
is
doing,
could
do
that.
we
don't
think
that
is
what
congress
thought
any
of
the
states
could
do.
this
court
has
said
that
those
grants
are
unconditional
and--
mr.
john
g.
gissberg
--no,
nome
is
who
is
being
held
hostage
here
by
the
state
of
alaska
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
actually.
we
think
that
what
the
army
corps
here
is
doing
is
not
only
misinterpreting,
they
are
ignoring
the
one
act
that
addresses
submerged
lands,
and
they
have
to
rely
on
the
rivers
and
harbors
appropriation
act
because
that
brings
the
secretary
of
the
army
into...
gives
him
some
authority
to
issue
exceptions
to
these
permits.
but
under
statutory
construction
rules,
the
only
governmental
agency
that
is
allowed
to
interpret
statutes
is
the
one
that
has
the
power,
and
so
they
can't
interpret
the
submerged
lands
act.
if
they
did,
they
would
find
there
are
no
gaps
in
it.
it
is
absolutely
clear
and
that
is
why
they
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
1899
and
try
to
create
this
authority.
they
shouldn't
be
doing
that.
they
should
be
going
to
congress
for
this
authority.
there
are
two
things
that
they
also
miss
in
addition
to
the
statutory
interpretation
problem.
one
is
the
separation
of
powers.
they
are
pretending
like
they
are
congress.
congress
has
said
that
they
should
do
this.
this
court
in
the
texas
boundary
case
said
that
anything
that
changes
the
ambulations
should
be
resolved
by
looking
to
congress.
they
have
also
upset
the
balance
of
federalism
because
the
people
that
decide
what
the
states'
rights
are
are
the
duly
elected
representatives
of
congress,
of
which
the
state
of
alaska
happens
at
this
time
to
have
three.
we
have
nobody
sitting
on
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
said
to
this
court
that
the
status
quo
is
to
be
maintained
and
so
we
have
to
have
a
fixed
boundary.
alaska
now
has
a
3-mile
limit
that
becomes
2-1/2
miles
off
nome.
that
is
not
the
status
quo.
the
status
quo
is
an
ambulatory
baseline.
it
is
a
functional
formula
that
this
court
laid
down
in
1965
based
on
the
law
of
the
sea
convention.
the
formula
is
what
is
stable.
everybody
can
figure
out
where
the
3-mile
limit
is
and
where
the
state's
lands
are.
under
the
government's
formula
you
have
to
be
able
to
know
whether
or
not...
right
above
the
nome
causeway
is
another
causeway.
right
below
it
is
the
cape
nome
causeway.
neither
of
them
have
disclaimers
on
it.
the
3-mile
limit
pops
out
in
those
places,
as
it
pops
out
at
the
12-mile
federal
territorial
sea.
so
we
totally
disagree
with
the
implications
of
what
is
happening
here.
it
is
not
creating...
what
they
are
doing
is
not
creating
any
stability.
it
is
causing
additional
confusion,
and
we
think
this
court
ought
to
correct
it.
