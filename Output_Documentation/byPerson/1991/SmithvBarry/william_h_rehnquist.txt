we'll
hear
argument
now
in
90-7477,
william
lewis
smith
v.
wayne
s.
barry.
mr.
goldblatt.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
original
of...
at
least
when
i
used
to
practice,
the
original
of
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
with
the
district
court.
is
that
still
true?
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
a
court
of
appeals
suspend
the
30-day
time
limit
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
that
is
the
same
as
saying
you're
appealing
from
the
final
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
said
that
about
a
pleading
which
attempts
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
have
we
ever
said
that
about
a
notice
of
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
why
should
we
construe
a
notice
of
appeal
liberally?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
matter
with
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
how
many
rules
do
we
have
to
bend
to
give
the
sort
of
breaks
you
want
given
to
pro
se
litigants?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
then
you
really
don't
have
to
rely,
you
say,
on
any
particular
solicitude
for
pro
se
litigants.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
goldblatt.
mr.
bamberger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
referring
to
some
of
the
court
decisions
that
are
referred
to
in,
say,
the
footnote
in
coppedge
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
bamberger,
if
a
brief,
as
you
now
apparently
think,
could
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
why
did
this
brief
not
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
treated
this
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
that
would
make
it
different
for
our
purposes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
perhaps.
that's
a
rather
vague
answer.
do
you
have
anything
better?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
when
you
say
that
an
appellate
brief
could
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
what
you
meant
was
something
that
had
everything
that
you
would
have
in
a
notice
of
appeal,
but
was
simply
captioned
as
his
appellate
brief.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bamberger.
mr.
goldblatt,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goldblatt,
i
can
understand
how
you
would
say
that
about
some
things
required
of
a
pro
se
litigant,
but
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
when
you've
got
a
form
in
the
back
of
the
rulebook
and
it
can
be
one
sentence
long,
i
really
don't
understand
that.
this
is
not
a
complicated
document.
counseled
litigants
file
one
sentence
notices
of
appeal
all
the
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
coppedge
was
in
1961.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-7477,
smith
against
barry
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
