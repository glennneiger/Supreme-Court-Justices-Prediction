mr.
david
h.
bamberger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rule
3
provides
that
an
appeal
shall
be
taken
by
the
timely
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
within
the
time
allowed
by
rule
4.
the
plain
language
of
rule
3
sets
apart
the
step
of
timely
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
as
a
matter
of
unique
significance.
according
to
the
rule,
the
failure
to
take
any
step
other
than
the
timely
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
does
not
affect
the
appeal's
validity
and
is
ground
for
such
action
only
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
the
implication,
of
course,
is
that
the
validity
of
an
appeal
hinges
on
the
timely
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
that
that
step
is
of
such
fundamental
importance
that
the
court
does
not
have
such
discretion
with
regard
to
a
failure
to
fulfill
that
requirement.
further
evidence
in
the
plain
language
of
the
rules
as
to
the
significance
of
this
step
is
the
time
limit
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
which,
unlike
other
provisions
of
the
rules
which
may
be
suspended
pursuant
to
rule
2,
may
not
be
enlarged
by
the
court,
in
accordance
with
rule
26(b).
in
torres,
this
court
emphasized
the
jurisdictional
nature
of
the
requirement
of
rule
3
and
the
consequent
need
for
strict
compliance
with
its
provisions.
the
1979
amendment
to
rule
3
recognized
the
practice
which
had
existed
of
not
allowing
mere
informality
of
form
of
a
notice
of
appeal
to
cause
the
loss
of
a
right
to
appeal,
and
on
that
basis
it
is
true
various
documents
have
been
allowed
to
substitute
for
a
notice
of
appeal.
however,
we
submit
that--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
we
submit
that
allowing
a
brief
to
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal
would
not
be
mere
informality
of
form,
but
would
be
waiving
a
separate
jurisdictional
requirement
altogether,
and
there
is
support
in
the
rules
for
that
position.
the
rules
are
designed
as
an
integrated
set
of
rules,
according
to
the
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
1.
they
set
out
detailed
provisions
regarding
notices
of
appeal
on
the
one
hand
and
briefs
on
the
other,
and
those
rules
have
different
requirements
relating
to
content,
filing,
and
service.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
i
believe
it
does,
justice
scalia,
in
the
sense
that
what
the
rules
really
require
are
two
separate
filings.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
and
it
is
true
that
rule
3
states
that
informality
of
form
or
title
would
not
be
the
basis
for
disallowing
a
notice
of
appeal,
so
hypothetically
i
suppose
if
were
titled,
brief,
and
it
were
treated
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
there
would
be
a
requirement
for
a
second
filing
of
a
document
that
would
serve
as
a
brief.
to
illustrate
further--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--there
was
no
further
brief.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
it's
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
not
treat--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--yes.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
that's
correct.
to
illustrate
further
in
the
rules
that
a
brief
was
intended
to
be
a
separate
filing
from
the
notice
of
appeal,
one
needs
to
note
only
that
virtually
any
brief
would
fulfill
the
content
requirements
of
a
notice
of
appeal
under
rule
3.
that
is,
it
would
designate
the
party
taking
the
appeal,
the
court
to
whom
the
appeal
was
being
taken,
and
would
certainly
indicate
the
issues,
if
not
the
judgment
or
order
being
appealed.
and
yet
the
rules
provide
for
a
separate
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
thus,
to
allow
a
brief
to
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal
effectively
eliminates
one
of
the
filings
required
by
the
rules
and
in
fact
one
that--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
the
rules
require
two
separate
filings.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
it
could
take...
yes,
justice
stevens,
it
could
take
care
of
it.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
yes.
there's
a
difference
between
textual--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--justice
o'connor,
if
a
paper
is
filed...
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
absolute...
what
the
complete
hypothetical
is,
but
if
a
paper
is
filed
which
fulfills
the
content
requirements
of
rule
3,
it
could
be
treated
by
the
court
as--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--if
it
were
designated
as
such,
yes.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
yes.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
yes.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
there's
a
difference--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--according
to
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedures,
it
contemplates
two
papers.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
justice
scalia,
with
all
due
deference
to
the
concept
of
solicitude
for
pro
se
litigants
or
for
incarcerated
individuals,
i
would
submit
that
it's
not
requiring
too
much
of
an
individual
to
know
what
a
brief
is.
the
average
lay
person
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
has
a
pretty
good
idea,
we
would
submit,
as
to
what
a
brief
is.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
well,
at
the
same
time
the
court
has
a
procedure
for
entering
an
order
that,
although
it
does
not
mandate
the
filing
of
an
informal
brief,
requires
the
clerk
to
send
the
briefs
out
to
counsel
and
to
the
pro
se
parties
with
an
instruction
that
if
the
briefs
are
to
be
filed,
they
must
be
filed
by
a
certain
date,
which
would
certainly
be
a
strong
suggestion
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in
having
the
issues
briefed.
we
submit
that
there
is
a
difference
between
textual
interpretation
of
the
rules
and
amending
them.
amendments
to
the
rules
are
required
by
statute
to
be
placed
before
congress
in
accordance
with
certain
prescribed
procedures.
thus,
even
though
justice
might
appear
to
be
served
in
particular
cases
by
having
the
courts
modify
the
requirements
to
the
rules,
that
practice
is
contrary
to
the
congressionally
mandated
process,
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
before,
adhering
to
the
procedures
specified
by
the
legislature
has
been
recognized
as
the
best
guarantee
of
even-handed
administration
of
the
law.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
in
this
instance,
the
brief
was
filed
as
a
brief,
it
was
not
treated
by
the
court
as
such.
it
also
did
not
contain
a
proper
judgment
designation.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
perhaps,
your
honor.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
in
this
instance,
the
brief
did
not
reflect
the
level
of
intention,
the
level
of
control,
the
level
of
specificity,
that's
required
by
the
rules
to
constitute
a
notice
of
appeal,
nor
did
it
reflect
the
level
of
intention
which
typically
in
prior
case
law
has
been
required
to
recognize
another
paper
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
notice
of
appeal.
this
brief...
and
i
thought
the
hypothetical
before
really
related
to
a
document
that
would
be
essentially
a
notice
of
appeal,
except
it
was
captioned,
brief...
this
brief
was
clearly
a
brief.
it
was
a
list
of
questions,
preprinted
in
form
by
the
fourth
circuit,
relating
to
the
issues
generally
to
which
the
petitioner
responded.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
yes,
that
is
what
i
meant,
because
rule
3(c)
clearly
requires
that
informality
of
title
shall
not
preclude
the
notice
of
appeal
serving
as
such,
so
if
someone
inadvertently
captioned
it,
brief,
then
that
would
not
stand
in
the
way.
on
the
other
hand,
this
document
was
a
series
of
questions
and
answers
relating
to
the
issues
generally,
and
was
more
what
would
typically
be
expected
of
a
brief,
a
discussion
of
the
issues
as
opposed
to--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--the
rules
require
two
filings.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
and
that's
the
only
document
that
would
be
filed?
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
the
rules
require
two
filings,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
yes,
sir.
that's
my
answer.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
i
guess
in
response
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
say
two
things.
first,
certainly
with
respect
to
dr.
barry
there
was
nothing
at
all
in
the
informal
brief
concerning
him,
and
as
to
the
other
defendants,
there
certainly
was
no
specific
designation
of
the
final
judgment
or
any
particular
judgment
or
order.
to
say
that
asking
for
a
new
trial
on
all
issues
triable
by
a
jury
is
sufficiently
specific
we
think
would
be
stretching
it
a
little
too
far.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
justice
souter,
with
respect
to
even
the
defendants
who
defended
the
case
at
trial,
there
were
certain
defendants
who
got
out
on
directed
verdict,
there
were
others
against
whom
only
one
claim
was
tried.
it's
simply
not
clear
enough
from
the
phrase...
we
would
submit
that
it's
not
clear
enough
from
the
phrase,
all
issues
triable
by
a
jury,
exactly
what
this
individual
is
appealing.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
well,
again,
as
i
stated
earlier,
i
think
you
could
probably
take
virtually
any
appellate
brief
and
say
that
it
sufficiently
discusses
the
issues
to
provide
notice
and
it
also
identifies
the
party
taking
the
appeal
and
the
court
to
whom
the
appeal
is
being
taken,
but
yet
the
rules
require
two
separate
filings,
the
giving
of
notice
first,
and
then,
at
a
later
date,
the
brief.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
i
believe
that
once
a
notice
of
appeal,
a
proper
notice
of
appeal
has
been
filed,
the
normal
process
would
be
for
the
appellate
court
to
issue
an
order
as
to
the
date
when
briefs
are
due.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
that
is
true.
that
is
true,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
document
was
not
specific
enough,
and
certainly
as
to
dr.
barry
was
completely
deficient.
petitioner
smith
refers
this
court
to
prior
decisions
showing
that
special
solicitude
for
pro
se
litigants
is
appropriate,
and
especially
prisoners.
the
premise
underlying
the
solicitude
that
is
afforded
to
pro
se
litigants
is
that
substantial
but
imperfect
compliance
may
be
accepted
when
an
appellant
has
done
all
that
he
could.
in
this
instance,
petitioner,
mr.
smith,
did
not
do
all
that
he
could
do.
he
demonstrated
that
he
knew
how
to
file
an
appeal.
he
did
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
he
simply
filed
it
prematurely,
and
the
rules,
of
course,
provide
that
it's
a
nullity.
he
was
advised
by
his
former
counsel
that
it
was
premature
and
that
he
had
to
file
another
notice
of
appeal,
and
that
he
had
to
do
so
by
a
date
certain.
he
failed
to
do
so.
the
1967
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
3
cites
decisions
in
cases
where
literal
compliance
could
not
be
exacted,
such
cases
as
where
the
appellant
is
ill,
those
sorts
of
situations.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
sort
of
solicitude
typically
is
accorded
in
cases
that
are
appeals
of
criminal
convictions.
on
the
other
hand,
here
we
have
a
case,
which
is
a
civil
case,
in
which,
in
fact,
the
appellant
won
a
verdict
in
his
favor,
and
simply
felt
that
it
was
insufficient.
we
would
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
no
warrant
for
extending
that
special
solicitude
to
mr.
smith.
the
30-day
time
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
has
been
held
to
be
mandatory
because
it's
an
event
of
jurisdictional
significance.
the
purpose
of
the
limit
is
to
set
a
definite
point
in
time
when
the
litigation
shall
be
at
an
end,
and
that's
a
requirement
that
cannot
be
waived,
and
the
failure
to
meet
it
is
not
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
what
i'm
suggesting,
justice
white,
is
that
a
document
which
fulfills
the
content
requirements
of
a
notice
of
appeal
but
is
simply
captioned,
brief,
i
would
not
suggest
that
that
is
invalid,
because
the
rule
clearly
states--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--they
relied
on
the
cooper
case,
and--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
i'm
trying
to
draw
a
distinction,
justice
white,
between
a
document
that
is
essentially
a
notice
of
appeal
that
is
miscaptioned,
which
was
a
hypothetical
that
we
discussed
earlier--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--i
guess
that
would
be
the
result--
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
--if
it
came
down
to
deciding
which
briefs
do
and
which
briefs
don't
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
that
certainly
would
appear
to
be
a
function
more
appropriate
to
the
court
of
appeals,
based
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
our
position
is
that
the
brief
in
this
case
was
not
a
notice
of
appeal
that
was
simply
miscaptioned,
but
a
full
discussion
of
the
issues
which
the
prisoner
clearly
recognized
as
a
brief.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
i'm
not
sure
i'm
prepared
to
answer
that,
justice
stevens.
the
functional
equivalent
doctrine
which
was
acknowledged
by
this
court...
was
acknowledged
by
this
court
in
torres,
where
the
court
observed
that
mere
technicalities
should
not
bar
appellate
review
if
the
litigant's
action
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
what
the
rules
require.
we
would
submit
that
smith's
filing
of
an
informal
brief
in
this
case,
which
he
now
advances
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
really
did
not
meet
that
test.
he
merely
filed
a
document
that
was
in
response
to
an
order
from
the
fourth
circuit
answering
specific
questions
posed
by
that
court
on
a
preprinted
form.
his
brief
was
within
the
time
allowed
for
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
but
apparently
so
only
because
the
fourth
circuit
ordered
him
to
file
it
within
a
certain
time.
mr.
david
h.
bamberger
no,
it
did
not,
it
excluded
it
from
its
holding.
we
would
submit
that
smith's
acts
simply
don't
manifest
a
degree
of
control
and
intent
sufficient
to
justify
accepting
them
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
what
the
rules
require.
the
requirements
of
the
rules
regarding
notices
of
appeal
are
clear.
they're
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
although
in
this
instance
the
petitioner
knew
how
to
follow
the
rules,
he
failed
to
file
a
timely
and
valid
notice
of
appeal.
there's
no
dispute
on
that.
we
submit
that
there's
simply
no
warrant
in
this
case
for
invoking
the
functional
equivalent
doctrine
with
regard
to
his
actions,
nor
should
his
brief
be
recognized
as
a
notice
of
appeal
on
the
basis
of
any
special
solicitude.
we
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit
had
no
jurisdiction
over
smith's
appeal,
and
its
dismissal
of
the
appeal
on
that
basis
should
be
affirmed.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions--
