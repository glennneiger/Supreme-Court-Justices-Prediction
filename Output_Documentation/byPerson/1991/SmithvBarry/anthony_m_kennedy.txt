justice
kennedy
would
your
rule
be
that
any
appellant's
brief
is
a
sufficient
notice
of
appeal,
or
is
it
somehow
confined
to
the
circumstances
present
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
so
if
you
prevail,
then
any
appellant
can
satisfy
the
notice
of
appeal
by
simply
filing
a
brief.
justice
kennedy
the
problem,
of
course,
with
that
is
that
notice
of
appeal
is
really
what
starts
the
time
ticking
for
compiling
of
the
record,
and
without
having
the
record
before
them,
the
appellee
who
has
to
answer
the
brief
within
the
prescribed
time
is
at
a
serious
disadvantage.
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
is
the
appellee
can
ask
for
an
extension,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
rule
with
very
far-reaching
consequences
that
you're
arguing,
although
there
are
some
equities
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
the
equities
prevail
i
want...
i
need
to
know
what
the
rule
is,
and
of
course
not
all
the
equities
are
on
your
side,
since
your
client's
own
attorney
advised
him
that
the
original
notice
of
appeal
was
invalid.
justice
kennedy
yes,
except
that
an
appellant's
brief,
as
i've
indicated,
starts
the
time
ticking
for
the
filing
of
a
responding
brief,
and
at
that
point
there
is
no
record,
so
it
seems
to
me
quite
plausible
to
say
that
we
do
have
a
rule
that
a
brief
cannot
be
a
notice
of
appeal,
because
otherwise
all
of
the
time
limits
in
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
are
skewed.
justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
the
circuit,
under
its
internal
operating
procedures,
could
not
say
in
cases
of
this
type
that
the
notice
of
appeal
shall
also
include
an
informal
statement
of
the
issues
to
be
relied
upon.
there
have
to
be
two
papers.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
two
papers...
one
paper
has
two
captions.
in
this
case,
he
did
file
a
notice,
but
didn't
file
a
brief.
why
can't
that
be
what
happened
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
this
circuit
specifically
does
not
require
that
a
brief
be
filed,
because
it
has
a
procedure
for
these
informal
briefs,
which
is
just
the
court's
form.
that's
the
whole
purpose.
so
the
circuit
itself
has
said
that
it
doesn't
want
briefs,
in
a
conventional
sense.
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioner
here
could
argue
that
the
appellees,
or
the
putative
appellees,
had
far
more
notice
of
what
the
issues
were
and
what
the
judgment
was
and
what
the
basis
of
the
appeal
was
from
this
informal
brief
than
it
would
from
just
the
one-line
statement
that's
required
by
the
rules
that
notice
is
hereby
given
that
an
appeal
is
taken...
want
a
new
trial,
he
complains
about
medical
evidence,
he
complains
about
his
counsel.
it
seems
to
me
it's
very,
very
clear
from
this
little
three-page
summary,
or
four-page
summary,
exactly
what
he's
complaining
about.
i
think
it's
far
more
specific
so
far
as
notice
than
the
standard
requisite
notice
of
appeal.
justice
kennedy
how
did
that
sequence
come
about?
the
informal
brief's
filed--
justice
kennedy
--and
then
there's
a
question
about
jurisdiction--
justice
kennedy
--yes.
justice
kennedy
but
was
the
brief
that
you
filed
addressed
to
all
of
the
issues,
or
just
to
the
jurisdictional
point?
