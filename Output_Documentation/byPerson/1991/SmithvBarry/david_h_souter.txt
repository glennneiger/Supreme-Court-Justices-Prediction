justice
souter
but
it
did
one
thing
more,
didn't
it?
didn't
it
in
effect
limit
the
issues
in
a
way
which
a
straight
notice
of
appeal
would
not
have
done?
it
limited
by
referring,
in
effect,
to
trial
error
rather
than...
or
perhaps
even
jury
error,
i
forget,
but
as
distinguished
from
pretrial
rulings.
justice
souter
yes,
but
we
don't
have
to
stretch
it
that
far.
all
we
have
to
do
is
say
it
was
effective
with
respect
to
those
things
that
it
clearly
did
specify,
it
was
not
effective
with
respect,
let's
say,
to
the
dismissal
of
dr.
barry.
i
mean,
if
we
take
your
objection
to
its
deficiencies,
it
doesn't
follow
that
this
can't
function
as
any
kind
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
it
simply
follows
that
it
could
function
only
as
a
limited
notice
of
appeal.
justice
souter
isn't
the
answer
to
that
to
ask
him
what
he
means,
rather
than
say
he
can't
appeal
anything
at
all?
justice
souter
they
don't
really
require
two
separate
filings,
do
they?
you
keep
saying
that.
i
mean,
a
person
could
waive
the
brief,
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
after
that
just
sort
of
punt
the
whole
process,
but
at
least
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
court
to
act
would
be
in
place,
and
that's
the
only
thing
in
issue
here,
isn't
that
true?
justice
souter
oh,
perfectly
true,
and
if
one
party
doesn't
file
a
brief
the
appellate
court
can
take
whatever
action
is
appropriate,
but
the
question
is,
did
they...
was
appellate
jurisdiction
established,
and
the
fact
is,
all
you
need
is
one
document
to
do
that,
you
don't
need
two.
isn't
that
true?
