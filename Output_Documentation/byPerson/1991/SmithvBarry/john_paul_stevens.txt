justice
stevens
plus
the
fact
i
suppose
such
a
brief
would
seldom
be
filed
within
the
time
permitted
for
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
stevens
why
can't
we
do
that
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
court
didn't
need
it.
it
could
have
asked
for
it.
i
mean,
why
couldn't
the
court
of
appeals...
the
question
is
one
of
power,
not
whether...
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
power
to
have
done
that
in
this
case,
because
if
the
notice
is
untimely
or
ineffective,
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
power
to
do
anything
in
the
case,
and
you're
saying
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
had
power
to
treat
this
brief
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
request
a
further
brief.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
the
question
is
whether...
your
position
is,
it
didn't
have
power
to
treat
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
just
answered
that
argument
a
moment
ago
by
saying
the
court
could
treat
one...
treat
the
brief
as
a
notice
and
then
require
another
brief.
isn't
that
a
complete
answer
to
this
argument?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
that
because
it's
labeled
a
brief
and
has
all
the
contents
of
a
brief,
the
court
has
no
power
to
treat
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
say,
mr.
appellant,
you've
filed
the
wrong
document,
please
now
file
a
further
brief.
justice
stevens
well,
i
know,
and
i'm
hypothesizing
a
case
in
which
a
brief
is
filed
incorrectly
that
has
all
the
requirements
of
complying
with
the
rules
and
the
court,
concerned
about
the
concern
you're
describing
now,
says,
we're
entitled
to
two
documents.
we
will
treat
this
one
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
now
file
your
other
brief
after
the
record's
been
brought
up
and
all
the
rest
and
file
it
at
an
appropriate
time.
why
wouldn't
that
take
care
of
the
concern
that
you're
now
describing?
justice
stevens
because
we're
not
talking
about
questions
of
administration,
we're
talking
about
questions
of
power.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
because
it
was
raised
earlier,
do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
fact
that
it
was...
the
document
was
filed
in
the
wrong
court?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask
this:
supposing
the
document
filed,
the
first
page
of
it
was
a
carbon
copy
out
of
the
forms
that
attach
to
the
rules...
a
notice
of
appeal
naming
the
party,
and
so
forth...
and
then
the
next
30
pages
were
a
legal
argument
with
a
summary
of
argument
and
citation
of
authorities,
and
so
forth.
is
that
a
valid
notice
of
appeal,
or
not?
justice
stevens
i
know,
but
say
he
made
the
mistake
of
filing
them
both
at
the
same
time
under
one
cover,
the
first
page
has
just
everything
in
it
you
put
in
the
notice
of
appeal,
but
it's
not
even
called
notice
of
appeal,
it
just
has
the
information
there,
and
then
the
rest
of
it's
just
a
brief
and
the
caption
is
called,
brief,
appellant's
brief.
you'd
say
that
document
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case?
justice
stevens
it's
the
only
document
that's
filed.
justice
stevens
but
your
answer
is,
that
would
not
be
sufficient.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
kind
of
related
question?
in
this
court
for
most
of
our
jurisdiction
the
certiorari
petition
is
what
has
to
be
filed
within
the
time
limit.
do
you
suppose
in
this...
we
would
have
the
power
to
treat
a
brief
as
a
cert
petition
if
we
thought
that
they
failed
to
file
one?
