mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
brief
may
serve
the
function
of
a
notice
of
appeal
and
thereby
vest
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
arises
in
the
context
of
a
civil
rights
action
that
was
filed
in
the
district
of
maryland
in
1983.
as
it
was
a
multiparty,
multiclaim
case,
one
respondent,
dr.
barry,
was
granted
summary
judgment
in
1984.
the
remainder
of
the
case
proceeded
in
the
ordinary
course
and
went
to
jury
trial
in
1988.
several
of
the
defendants
were
granted
a
directed
verdict.
the
remainder
of
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
and
after
that
verdict
was
entered,
final
judgment
was
entered
in
february
of
1988.
subsequent
thereto,
smith
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
that
notice
of
appeal,
however,
was
of
no
effect
by
operation
of
rule
4(a)(4)
because
there
was
a
motion
j.n.o.v.
pending
at
that
time.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
there
is
no
argument
made
here
that
that
notice
of
appeal
on
its
own
may
vest
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
made
that
clear
in
griggs
and
other
cases.
of
no
effect
means
what
that
language
states
in
4(a)(4).
nevertheless,
the
notice
of
appeal
was
forwarded
to
the
circuit
court
by
the
district
court,
and
that
court
started
a
process
of
informal
briefing
which
it
uses
in
cases
where
there
is
a
pro
se
appeal.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
true...
it
was
true
in
this
case,
and
it's
required
by
rule
3(d),
and
the
district
court
is
then
required...
the
clerk
is
required
to
transmit
it
forthwith
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
docket
entries.
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
brief
was
filed
with
the
circuit
court.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct.
rule
4(a)(1)
i
believe
provides
that
when
a
notice
of
appeal
is
filed
with
the
circuit
rather
than
with
the
district
court,
it
is
still
operational,
but
under
that
rule
the
circuit
court
is
required
to
date
it,
transmit
it
back
to
the
district
court,
which
would
then
docket
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
i
think
the
purpose
of
that
rule
is
to
render
the
notice
of
appeal
effective
if
it
is
filed
in
the
wrong
court.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
the
rule
that
we're
relying
on
is
the
rule
that's
stated
in
the
comment
to
rule
3(c),
which
is
that
any
paper
that
serves
the
function
of
notice
will
vest
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes,
but
i
would
qualify
it
by
saying
that
in
the
ordinary
course
that
is
not
likely
to
occur,
and
i
think
a
brief
like
any...
it
would
be...
the
modification
in
this
case
would
be
to
say
that
a
brief
cannot
serve
that
purpose,
although
any
other
document
can,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
the
equities
are
what
should
prevail
here.
i
think
it
really...
in
many
ways,
this
is
the
rule
that
has
been
in
effect--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
but
at
the
time
that
his
attorney
sent
him
that
letter,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
he
was
under
instructions
from
the
fourth
circuit
to
file
a
brief.
it's
not
as
if
he
did
nothing,
or
ignored
it
and
did
nothing
in
the
process.
he
merely
complied
with
the
orders
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
filed
the
brief.
i
think
the
point
here
is
is
that
the
brief
served
the
function
of
notice.
it
did
provide
the
other
side
with
the
information
it
needed
that
a
notice
of
appeal
would
accommodate.
a
notice
of
appeal
doesn't
tell
the
other
side
anything
more
than
that
the
case
is
not
over.
it
doesn't
even
need
to
identify
who
the
appellees
necessarily
are.
it
needs
to
tell
the
other
side
that
the
case
has...
an
appeal
has
been
taken.
you're
required
to
identify
the
parties
appellant.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
it
is.
the
reason
why
the
premature
appeal
under
rule
4(a)(4)
shall
have
no
effect
is
because
the
rule
expressly
states
that.
i'm
not
asking
the
court
here
to
superimpose
judicial
entity
on
an
otherwise
silent
rule.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
and
that
would
apply
to
the
notice
of
appeal
that
he
in
fact
filed,
but
for
purposes
of
what
is
known
as
the
functional
equivalent
doctrine,
that
brief
that
he
filed
in
the
appellate
court
within
the
appropriate
30-day
time
frame
served
every
purpose
that
the
other
side
would
have
gotten
had
he
filed
a
new
notice
of
appeal,
as
the
rules
would
otherwise
require,
and
that
concept
that
an
equivalent
document,
if
it
serves
the
purpose
of
notice,
vests
jurisdiction,
has
its
origins
in
rule
3(c)
itself,
in
the
comment
to
rule
3(c),
and
in
fact
even
before
the
1979
amendments.
the
1967
amendments
point
to
coppedge
v.
united
states,
which
identified
that
all
manner
of
documents
have
been
allowed
to
serve
the
function
of
notice
and
preserve
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals...
coppedge
was
a
pro
se
case...
and
then
in
1979
the
rule
was
amended
to
say
that
an
appeal
should
not
be
dismissed
for
informality
of
form
of
title
in
the
notice
of
appeal.
now
that
would
have
been
the
rule,
i
submit,
e
pro...
pro
se
litigants
even
before
1979.
the
only
thing
the
amendment
really
did
was
to
solidify
it,
make
it
clear,
and
apply
it
to
all
cases
whether
the
person
is
represented
by
counsel
or
not.
i
think
the
important
thing
to
bear
in
mind
is,
the
importance
of
notice
of
appeal
is
to
give
notice.
beyond
that,
the
other
requirements
have
always
contained
the
caveat
that
they
can
be
construed
liberally,
and
this
court
has
done
so
because
the
rule
so
directs.
and
these
rules,
unlike
other
rules
of
procedure,
contain
rule
2
as
well,
which
allows
the
circuits
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
rules
in
a
given
case
for
good
cause
shown,
so
these
rules
carry
with
them
a
purpose
that
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
it
is
preferable
to
construe
them
liberally--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no
it
could
not,
because
under
rule
26(b)...
rule
2
is
specifically
limited
by
rule
26(b),
which
says
nothing
in
these
rules
shall
give
the
courts
the
authority
to
extend
the
time
for
filing
an
appeal,
and
26(b)
is
the
limit
on
the
equitable
powers
of
the
court.
the
time
cannot
be
extended.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
it
does
not.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it
provided
notice
to
barry,
justice
o'connor,
because
it
was
served
upon
dr.
barry.
his
counsel,
in
fact,
received
a
copy
of
it,
so
at
least--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
think
so,
if
one
distinguishes
between
notice
merely
alerting
the
party
that
the
judgment
has
an
appeal...
been
appealed,
as
opposed
to
notice
of
what
the
issues
are
that
you
intend
to
raise.
the
general
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
is
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
in
a
case
brings
up
the
entire
case.
there's
not
a
requirement
at
that
point
that
you
identify
which
appellees
you're
going
to
go
against
or
what
you're
going
to
do.
indeed,
if
you
file
your
notice
of
appeal
with
the
district
court,
it's
served
on
all
parties.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
think
not,
and
i
think
an
example
of
that
is
certainly
dr.
barry,
even
before
he
received
that
brief,
just
by
having
notice
that
an
appeal
had
been
taken,
he
had
identified
the
very
issue
that
we
ultimately,
when
we
were
appointed,
raised
in
the
case.
he
knew
what
the
issue
was
in
the
case,
and
in
fact
submitted
his
informal
brief
before
smith
submitted
his
own
pro
se.
i
think
that
the
purposes
of
notice,
as
limited
as
they
are,
are
simply
to
make
a
decision
within
30
days
and
alert
the
court
and
the
other
sides
that
an
appeal
has
been
taken,
that
what
he
put
in
that
informal
brief,
albeit
imprecise,
albeit
pro
se
language,
alerted
everyone
on
the
other
side
of
the
potentiality
that
they
would
be
included
in
the
case.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
i
would,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
would
suggest
that
any
document
that
served
the
purpose
of
notice,
if
it's
filed
within
the
30-day
time
frame,
under
the
rule,
under
the
advisory
committee
note,
will
serve
the
purpose.
i
think
the
important
point
is,
notice
is
important,
but
its
importance
is
limited
to
making
that
decision.
it's
entirely
possible
that
parties
would
not
know
when
you
appeal
it
and
identify
the
final
judgment
as
the
order
being
appealed
in
a
multiparty
case,
those
parties
will
not
know
at
that
point
whether
they're
in
the
case
at
all,
what
issues
are
in
the
case,
and
what
issues
are
not.
it
serves
a
very,
very
limited
purpose,
and
that
is
why
this
document,
as
imprecise
as
it
is,
gave
them
all
the
notice
that
they'd
be
entitled
to
in
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
souter,
my
answer
there,
i
think
is
that
here
you
have
to
look
at
that
pleading
as
a
pro
se
pleading,
so
i
don't
think
the
court
would
look
at
that
pleading
if
it
was
submitted
by
a
lawyer
in
the
same
way,
and
that
is
with
solicitude,
and
i
think
that
when
he
answers
the
question,
what
relief
do
you
want,
a
new
trial
on
all
issues
triable
by
jury,
that
gave
the
other
side
enough
information
to
recognize
the
possibility
of
any
issue
being
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
i
am,
for
a
pro
se
litigant.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
have
any
express
authority,
other
than
this
court's
admonition
that
pro
se
pleadings
are
to
be
construed
liberally.
it
does
require
liberal
construction
to
get
to
that
point.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
not
to
my
knowledge.
however,
i
would
submit
that,
given
the
purpose
of
the
notice,
that
this
is...
does
every
bit
as
much
as
it
should
when
construed
liberally,
and
also--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--because
the
alternative
is
to
have
cases
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
problem
with
that,
i
think,
particularly
for
pro
se
litigants...
first
of
all,
i
think
rule
3(c)
itself
says
that
it's
not
to
occur.
the
preference
is
to
not
have
that
happen.
we
want
this
construed
liberally
to
protect
jurisdiction,
and
that's
what
coppedge
does,
and
i
think
the
concept
of
final
judgment,
which
is
a
concept
that
this
court
on
several
occasions,
of
course,
has
had
to
pass
on,
is
not
something
that
a
pro
se
litigant
is
going
to
readily
understand.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
think
you
have
to
bend
anything
more
than
the
solicitude
that
their
pleadings
are
entitled
to.
the
rule
itself,
both
for
counseled
litigants
and
for
pro
se
litigants,
has
always
bent
this
rule
in
favor
of
finding
jurisdiction.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
think
we
have
to.
i
think
it
helps
us,
though.
i
don't
think
it
can
hurt
us.
i
think
that
even
with
counseled
litigants
the
rule
from
this
court
since
foman
v.
davis
with
regard
to
judgment
designation
in
a
notice
of
appeal
has
been
that
even
a
mistake
in
the
designation,
if
the
intent
to
appeal
is
manifest
and
the
other
side
is
not
prejudiced
thereby,
will
not
be
fatal.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
scalia,
that
language,
if
you
look
to
the
explanation
in
the
advisory
committee
note,
which
this
court
has
of
course
indicated
is
of
significance
in
interpreting
this,
refers
to
a
judge
wisdom
opinion
in
cobb
v.
lewis
where
a
petition
to
appeal
under
1292(b)
was
allowed...
was
denied,
but
the
court
treated
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal
under
1292(a).
in
the
discussion,
the
court
identified
the
various
documents
that
over
the
years
the
federal
appellate
courts
have
allowed
to
do
service
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
including
an
appellate
brief,
and
i
think
read
together
with
that
language,
plus
the
language
in
the
1967--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
think
it
did,
especially
in
light
of
the
reference
in
the
1967
comment
to
coppedge
v.
united
states,
which
is
a
case
decided
by
this
court,
in
which
the
court
in
a
footnote
indicated
pro
se
appellants
have
not
had
trouble
with
the
notice
of
appeal
requirements
because
of
the
liberal
attitude
the
courts
have
taken,
and
proceeded
to
string-cite
any
number
of
cases,
including
motions
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
letters
to
judges,
any
manner
of
document
that
can
serve
notice.
the
point
being
that
if
you
accomplish
what
you
have
to
accomplish
under
rule
3,
you
have
vested
jurisdiction,
and
that
that
is
the
preferred
rule
to
strict
compliance
with
these
particular
procedural
rules.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
what
rule
4
says.
the
court
in
this
case--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no,
because--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--well,
no,
the
court
actually
appointed
counsel
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
notice
of
appeal
or
not.
had
it
decided
that
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
presumably
it
would
have
sent
it
down
to
the
district
court.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
in
other
words,
i
think
this
isn't
the
type
of
situation
where
you
necessarily
collapse
the
rules.
i
don't
think
the
court
would
have
been
required
to
treat
it
both
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
a
brief.
it
could
have
treated
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
directed
the
party
to
then
file
a
brief.
that
option
is
always
there.
it
also
isn't
a
situation
where
you're
concerned
with
willful
noncompliance
with
the
rules
or
deliberate
defiance
of
them.
the
court
would
always
have
the
power
under
rule
3(a)
for
noncompliance
with
the
rules
in
its
discretion
to
impose
whatever
sanction
it
wants,
including
dismissal
of
the
appeal,
but
in
this
situation
what
the
court
did
was
adopt
the
rule
that
a
brief
may
never
be
a
notice
of
appeal
and
divested
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
i
would
submit
that
there's
no
basis
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
or
in
this
rule
to
single
out
any
document
and
say
that
this
one
document
will
never
do
service
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
even
though
any
other
paper
may
do
it,
and
that
is
the
word
that
is
used
in
the
comment.
a
paper
that
serves
the
function
of
notice
vests
jurisdiction,
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
first
issue
in
this
case.
the
second
issue,
which
is
if
you
get
over
that
hurdle
of
whether
this
particular
document,
this
informal
brief,
does
meet
the
court's
requirements
for
compliance
with
rule
3(c),
which
is
a
separate
issue.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
kennedy,
the
reason
we
get
this
informal
brief
is
because
he
filed
an
untimely
notice
of
appeal.
there
was
notice
in
this
case,
but
if
we
take
it
out
of
that
context
and
just
have
a
brief
filed
with
nothing
else
having
been
done,
i
suspect
that
the
court
would
not
treat
that
as
a
brief.
it
might
treat
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
start
the
correct
procedures,
but
it
is
not
a
brief.
it
is
not
filed
pursuant
to
the
orders
of
the
court
in
the
ordinary
course,
and
my
point
is
the
court
should
not
be
guided
by
the
title
the
litigant
puts
on
the
document
any
more
than
the
court
is
guided
by
the
title
that
litigants
put
on
any
other
documents.
it's
not
a
brief
in
that
sense.
it
may
well
be
a
notice
of
appeal,
but
it's
not
a
brief,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
trigger
any
of
the
other
time
requirements
because
the
court
would
not
even
have
the
case
docketed,
and
i
think
that's
the
real
answer
to
that
question.
it's
not
a
brief.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
for
lawyers
that
would
be
almost
remarkable
that
that
would
be
done,
and
they're
not
going
to
file
a
brief
40
days
early
to
avoid
filing
a
one-page
document.
in
that
sense,
it
comes
up
in
an
odd
sequence
of
facts.
it
would
be
very...
it's
very
likely
that
a
pro
se
litigant
might
file
a
brief
for
appeal
without
having
done
anything
else,
and
i
think
what
a
circuit
would
do
with
that
is
recognize
they
don't
have
the
case.
if
they're
going
to
treat
it
as
anything,
it
will
be
treated
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
it
will
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court,
as
with
letters
to
judges,
motions
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
motions
for
bond,
and
all
manner
of
other
documents
that
this
type
situation
has
come
up.
again,
i
think
the
important
thing
here
that
makes
this
ruling
unusual
is
that
it
is
the
first
ruling
to
come
from
the
courts
excluding
a
document.
that
has
not
been
done
in
the
past.
this
is
the
first
document
that
has
been
targeted
that
it
may
not
be
the
equivalent
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
that's
the
context
we
think
that
is
determinative.
there's
nothing
in
the
rules
that
say
that,
and
the
rule
is
very
permissive
in
this
regard.
the
only
other
issue
in
the
case
is
the
judgment
designation.
there's
no
dispute
that
his
informal
brief
identifies
the
court
he's
appealing
to
and
who
the
appellant
is,
and
with
the
judgment
designation,
that
is
something
that
the
court,
since
foman
and
later
1990
in
firstier,
has
made
quite
clear
that
mistakes
in
that
judgment
designation,
in
the
absence
of
prejudice
to
the
other
side,
are
not
going
to
be
fatal.
and
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
dr.
barry,
who
briefed
the
issue
before
smith
did,
knew
exactly
what
issues
were
in
the
case,
and
it
comes
in
stark
relief,
because
there's
no
question
also
that
the
basis
upon
which
dr.
barry
was
dismissed
from
this
case,
calvert
v.
sharp,
was
overruled
by
this
court
in
west
v.
atkins,
and
that
his
claim
that
he
was
not
amenable
to
suit
under
1983
because
he
was
a
private
physician,
cannot
be
sustained
on
appeal
on
that
basis.
and
i
think
in
that
regard,
when
looking
at
the
judgment
designation,
all
of
the
defendants
knew
what
the
issues
were
in
the
case.
they
had
effective
notice
that
the
judgment
was
being
appealed,
and
there
is
no
reason
that
this
case
should
not
proceed
to
be
decided
on
the
merits,
however
it
may
come
out.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
opening
argument.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question,
the
basis
for
the
fourth
circuit
ruling
was
any
document
called
a
brief
may
not
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
they
reserved...
they
had
no
occasion
to
decide
the
question
whether
this
particular
document,
if
it
could
be
considered,
was
a
valid
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
they
make
reference
to
that,
they
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
solicitude
that
ordinarily
would
be
given
would
not
necessarily--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--but
then
they--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that's
correct.
they
say
it's
all
on
a
form...
as
i
say,
he
took
the
initiative
to
fill
it
out
and
send
it
back,
but
i
think
they
then
go
on
to
adopt
carter,
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
rule,
that
is
a
blanket
rule
that
a
brief
may
never
do
service
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
that's
what
they
premise
their
holding
on
and
drop
a
footnote
and
say,
because
of
our
holding
we
have
no
occasion
to
determine
whether
this
particular
document
meets
the
judgment
designation
requirement.
so
i
think
that
the
holding
is
clear
a
brief
not
do
service,
and
i
would
submit
respectfully
that
it
not
a
defensible
position,
and
that...
because
there's
just
nothing
in
the
rules
that
would
do
that.
i
would
also
again
point
out
there's
also
no
question
in
this
case
that
this
informal
brief
has
neven
been
the
brief
in
this
case.
when
we
were
appointed
to
the
case,
this
case
went
through
classical,
formal
briefing
under
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
with
briefs
that
looked
like
briefs,
and
the
court
used
those
briefs
to
decide
whether
this
document
was
a
valid
notice
of
appeal
and
it
was
based
on
the
conclusion
that
a
brief,
something
labeled
a
brief,
may
not
be
a
valid
notice
of
appeal,
that
the
case
was
dismissed.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
informal--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--the
way...
no,
the
way...
barry
files
his
informal
brief,
smith
then
files
his
informal
brief,--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--then
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
this
court
decides
west
v.
atkins
on
june
20th,
1988,
which
essentially
knocks
out
barry's
sole
basis
for
getting
out
of
the
case.
then
on
june
24th,
i
believe
it
was,
they
filed
a
brief
saying
well,
west
v.
atkins
came
down,
calvert
no
longer
gets
us
out
of
the
case,
but
he
didn't
appeal
to
us
anyway.
it
was
at
that
point,
not,
at
that
point,
even
identifying
the
fact
that
the
notice
of
appeal
was
invalid.
it
was
on
a
totally
different
issue
at
that
point...
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
circuit
appointed
us
to
represent
smith
and
brief
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
informal
brief
could
serve
as
a
valid
notice
of
appeal.
we
then
went
through
the
ordinary
briefing.
we
had
a
briefing
schedule,
we
filed
our
brief,
they
filed
theirs,
there
was
a
reply
brief,
and
a
decision.
so
in
this
case
itself
this
informal
brief
is
not
a
brief
at
all.
that's
never
been
the
issue
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
only
issue
was,
can
we
call
it
a
notice
of
appeal?
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
all
the
issues...
jurisdictional
point,
plus
the
issues
on
the
merits
as
to
why
it
should
be
reversed
as
to
dr.
barry,
and
why
it
should
be
reversed
as
to
the
remaining
respondents,
and
in
that
sense,
that's
the
issue
that
was
before
the
fourth
circuit,
and
there
can't
be
any
doubt
about
it.
i
just
want
to
close
briefly
on
the
question
of
solicitude,
and
i
think
the
one
thing
that
my
colleague
omits
is
the
fact
that
mr.
smith
is
proceeding
pro
se
in
this
matter.
he
is
also,
as
the
record
makes
very
clear,
suffering
from
rather
substantial
psychological
problems,
and
they
are
putting
an
onus
on
him
that
i
submit
is
inappropriate
under
these
rules...
inappropriate
under
the
spirit
of
these
rules,
and
putting
him
to
a
task
that
he
and
many
other
people
out
there
simply
cannot
meet,
in
a
situation
where
there
is
absolutely
no
prejudice
to
them
at
all.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
agree
with
that.
he
did
file
that
document.
it
was
by
operation
of
rule
4(a)(4)
that
we're
left
in
a
situation
where
that
document,
that
notice
of
appeal
that
he
filed,
is
of
no
effect,
and
the
question
is
whether
this
other
document
can
save
him
in
these
circumstances,
can
save
jurisdiction.
i
would
agree
that
in
the
ordinary
course
the
notice
of
appeal
requirement
can
be
met,
and
i
would
submit
it
is.
there
may
be
problems
with
the
judgment
designation
in
it,
but
he
was
able
to
do
that.
what
he
didn't
understand
was
the
operation
of
rule
4(a)(4),
which
apparently
to
a
certain
extent
was
spurred
on
by
instructions
from
the
fourth
circuit
that
he
did
have
a
valid
appeal
and
that
he
should
file
his
informal
brief.
he
did
that.
he
was
attempting
to
comply
with
the
rules
as
he
understood
them.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it's
not
in
the
rule
itself.
i
think
where
it
was
probably
originally
invented,
or
the
words
were
used,
was
in
coppedge
v.
united
states,
which
is
cited
in
the
comment
to
the
rules,
the
way
it
should
operate.
you
would
have
to
go
back
prior
to
rule
3
when
it
was
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
but
it
certainly
has
been
part
of
federal
jurisprudence.
coppedge
was
in
the
1930's,
and
it
cited
a
string-cite
of
cases
where
functional
equivalents
have
been
upheld.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke,
but
it
referred
back
to
cases
that
had
been
relied
on
up
to
that
point,
so
it's
been
in
there
since
before
the
language
in
3(c)
was
adopted,
and
the
advisory
committee
note
makes
it
clear
that
that
is
the
intended
way.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
torres
would
have
been
the
last
case
where
you
construed
one
of
the
requirements
in
3(c).
there
was
some
language
in
firstier
which
was
1990,
i
believe,
where
reference
was
also
made
to
rule
3(c),
the
judgment
designation
requirement,
but
the
more
general
compliance
with
the
rules
was
last
discussed
in
torres.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
the
rule
writers
i
would
suggest
did
recognize
the
rule
in
their
comments,
making
it
very
clear
as
to
how
it
should
be
applied.
they
provided
the
guidance
which
i
think
provides
a
fairly
clear
understanding
of
how
the
rule
was
to
operate.
this
is
not
a
question
of
asking
for
a
gloss
on
this
to
make
it
operate
in
a
way
that
was
not
intended.
that's
not
what
we're
requesting
that
the
court
do.
this
is
the
way
the
rule
is
intended
to
operate.
it
is
the
other
side
that
is
injecting
a
level
of
arbitrariness
into
this
that
is
expressly
disclaimed
by
these
rules.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
