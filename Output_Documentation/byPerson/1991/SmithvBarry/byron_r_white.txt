justice
white
well,
i
take
it
you
aren't
really
defending
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
a
brief
can
never
operate
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case?
what
was
the
basis
for
its
dismissal?
didn't
they
say
that
a
brief
can
never
operate
as
a
notice
of
appeal?
justice
white
well,
what
did
it
say?
i
mean,
they
say
a
brief
cannot
operate
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
white
and
you're
not
defending
that,
i
don't
think.
it
doesn't
sound
like
you're
defending
it.
justice
white
well,
what
if
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
wrong
on
saying
it
can
never
operate
as
a
notice
of
appeal?
shouldn't
we
just
remand
and
say,
sometimes
it
can
and
sometimes
it
can't,
and
why
don't
you
figure
out
if
it
did
in
this
case?
justice
white
because
we...
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
about
this
case
that
we
probably
don't
know.
should
we
get
down
to...
should
we
really
say
well,
a
brief
can
operate
as
a
notice
of
appeal
in
some
circumstances,
and
then
should
we
go
on
here
and
decide
whether
this
particular
brief
did
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal?
justice
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
the
things
you
were
just
talking
about
for
turning
down...
for
dismissing
the
case,
that
contentwise
it
wasn't
sufficient?
justice
white
where
was
the
functional
equivalent
rule
first
invented,
or
was
it
invented?
that
isn't
in
the
rule,
is
it?
justice
white
when
did
we
last
use
it,
in
torres?
justice
white
do
the
rule
writers
recognize
the
rule?
