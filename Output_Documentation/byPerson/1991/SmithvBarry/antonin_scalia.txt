justice
scalia
but
the
rule
about
not
being
able
to
take
it...
you
know,
if
you
take
it
too
soon
it's
ineffective,
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
consistent
with
this
rule
you're
urging
upon
us,
is
it?
justice
scalia
but
why
would
the
rule
state
that
if
the
rule
maker
was
only
concerned
about
the
other
side
having
notice?
the
fact
that
it's
filed
too
soon
doesn't
fail
to
give
the
other
side
notice.
it
does.
it
does
give
the
other
side
notice.
justice
scalia
yes,
and
if
i
got
a
notice
of
appeal
i
would
understand
that
to
be
the
case,
and
therefore
i
would
think
even
though
it
doesn't
name
my...
the
cause
of
action
against
me
in
particular,
i
have
got
to
assume
that
it
may
involve
me.
but
when
i
get
a
brief
that
supposedly
is
directed
at
everything
that's
supposed
to
be
involved
in
the
appeal,
i
might
feel
differently,
don't
you
think?
justice
scalia
if
this
brief
hadn't
been
filed
within
the
30-day
period
after
final...
suppose
the
final
judgment
still
hadn't
entered
when
this
brief
was
filed,
then
you'd
be
out
of
court?
justice
scalia
until
you
filed
your
reply
brief.
i
assume
your
reply
brief
might
bring
you
back
in
court
again.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
any
case
that
involves
a
document
such
as
this,
which
is
not
even
intended
as
a
notice
of
appeal?
i
mean,
3(c)
says
an
appeal
shall
not
be
dismissed
for
informality
of
form
or
title
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
different
when
the
document
that
is
filed
is
not
even
intended
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal.
it's
intended
to
be
a
brief.
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
it
referred
to
just
the
holding
of
the
case,
you
think
it
referred
to
every
example
that
the
case
gave?
justice
scalia
should
the
court
of
appeals
have
taken
this
brief
and
sent
it
down
to
the
district
court
for
filing
there,
as
it's
supposed
to
do
when
it
erroneously
gets
a
notice
of
appeal?
isn't
that
what
rule
4
somewhere
says?
justice
scalia
didn't
do
that,
did
it?
justice
scalia
so
the
court
didn't
think
it
was
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
scalia
would
have
sent
it
down
to
the
district
court.
justice
scalia
well,
couldn't
one
maintain
that
position
and
say
that
all
it
leads
to
is
the
conclusion
that
once
you
decide
it
will
be
treated
as
a
notice
of
appeal
it
shall
no
longer
be
treated
as
a
brief?
i
mean,
i
think
it's
quite
logical
what
you
say,
that
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
the
rules
have
two
separate
requirements,
a
notice
requirement
and
a
brief
requirement,
and
there
should
be
both,
but
i
think
what
your
colleague
is
saying
is
simply,
this
one
was
the
former.
it
was
the
notice.
call
it
a
notice,
and
he
hasn't
filed
his
brief
yet.
he'll
have
to
file
a
later
brief.
doesn't
that
satisfy
your
objection?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
they
did
rely
in
addition
to...
upon
the
broadest
ground,
upon
the
somewhat
narrower
ground
that
this
particular
brief
wasn't
even
a
brief
initiated
by
this
appellant
but
was
in
response
to
the
request.
didn't
they
rely
on
that?
justice
scalia
they
don't
refer
to
the
incompleteness
of
the
content.
justice
scalia
but
they
do
say,
this
is
not
even
your
ordinary
brief,
it's
a
step
below
that.
it's
just
a
response
to
a
batch
of
questions
from
the
court
of
appeals.
he
didn't
even
take
the
initiative.
