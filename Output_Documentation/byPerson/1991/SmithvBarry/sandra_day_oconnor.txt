justice
o'connor
but
the
brief
here
was
not
filed
with
the
district
court.
justice
o'connor
and
yet
you
want
the
brief
to
be
considered
the
notice
of
appeal.
justice
o'connor
mr.
goldblatt,
the
form
of
brief
that
was
filed
here
does
not
expressly
name
the
individuals
against
whom
the
claims
are
being
made,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
and
it
would
be
quite
a
stretch,
wouldn't
it,
to
say
that
whatever
else
it
might
do
that
it
gave
any
kind
of
notice
to
dr.
barry,
who'd
been
dismissed
years
before
by
the
court.
i
mean,
how
do
you
think
it
provided
notice
to
barry?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
it
would
give
any
indication
that
dr.
barry
was
subject
to
it,
or
being
noticed?
justice
o'connor
mr.
bamberger,
do
you
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit's
suggestion
that
an
appellate
brief
can
never
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal?
justice
o'connor
so
you're
backing
away
from
the
answer
you
gave
me
earlier
in
saying
that
you
take
the
position
that
a
brief
can
never
serve
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
that
was
your
answer
to
me.
now
you're
changing
your
mind,
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
even
if
it's
a
brief...
an
appellate
brief.
justice
o'connor
designated
as
a
brief,
but
meets
all
the
requirements
of
giving
notice.
justice
o'connor
it
could
be
treated
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
justice
o'connor
okay,
and
that's
not
the
answer
you
gave
me
previously.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
while
a
state
prison
inmate,
the
petitioner,
william
smith,
brought
suit
against
the
prison
officials
and
three
doctors
under
section
1983
of
the
united
states
code
alleging
violations
of
his
eighth
amendment
rights.
a
federal
jury
found
in
favor
of
smith
on
one
of
his
claims
and
awarded
him
damages.
smith
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
trial
court's
judgment.
the
notice
was
filed
prematurely
and
was
ineffective.
nevertheless,
the
clerk
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
sent
smith
a
copy
of
the
informal
briefing
form
that
is
used
in
that
circuit
for
pro
se
appeals.
smith
filled
out
this
form
and
returned
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
within
the
time
allowed
by
the
federal
rules
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
dismissed
smith's
appeal
reasoning
that
an
appellate
brief
can
never
substitute
for
the
notice
of
appeal
required
by
rule
3
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
we
hold
today
that
a
document
filed
within
the
time
specified
by
the
federal
rules
and
given
the
notice
required
by
the
rules
is
effective
as
a
notice
of
appeal.
accordingly,
the
decision
below
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
including
a
determination
of
whether
the
brief
filed
in
this
case
gave
the
notice
required
by
the
rules.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgement.
