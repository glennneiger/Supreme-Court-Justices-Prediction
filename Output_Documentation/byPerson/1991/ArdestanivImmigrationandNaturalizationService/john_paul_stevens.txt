justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
in
legislative
history
materials.
there's
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
itself
that
answers
the
question
whether
social
security
hearings
are
covered.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
they
are
under
the
apa
or
whatever
it
is,
then
you
argue
that
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
the
deportation
proceeding
is
also
under?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
the
distinction...
what...
as
i
remember,
and
i
am
very
vague
on
it,
but
this
distinction
only
lasted
for
a
couple
of
years,
1950
or
'52,
when
they
allowed
the
ins
hearing
officer
to
have
investigative
functions.
what
is
it
that
terminated
the
ins
hearing
officer's
ability
to
have
this
dual
function?
is
it
statute
or
a
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
carrying
justice
scalia's
question
a
bit
further,
if
there
were
some
statute,
not
part
of
apa,
just
some...
one
statute
at
large
in
some
isolated
part
of
the
u.s.
code
that
said
proceedings
x
shall
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
apa.
then
you
would
say
there
was
an
entitlement
to
fees.
because
then
you
would
say
that
proceeding
is
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
as
defined
in
section
554
of
the
title
v.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
some
third
statute
or
if
the
ins
statute
itself
required
an
adjudication
to
fit
the
definition
of
554.
you
would
still
say
it's
an
adjudication
as
defined
in
554,
and
therefore,
under
554,
as
you
read
the
word
"under".
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
being
that
the
hearing
officer's
capacity
is
not
defined
in
554.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
entirely
different
from
marcello.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
right
there,
if
one
were
to
agree,
and
i
understand
you
don't
agree
with
this,
but
the
word
"under"
should
be
given
the
meaning
"as
defined
in,
then
would
you
win
or
lose?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
if
a
statute
enacts
the
precisely
identical
procedures
to
those
set
forth
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
that
then
eaja
fees
would
not
apply...
say
you
enact
a
new
statute...
nuclear
regulatory
agency,
or
something
or
another...
that
that
would
not
apply
unless
the
statute,
its
only
word
said
that
these
procedures...
these
proceedings
are
governed
by
the
apa.
their
enacting
parallel
procedures
would
not
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
very
clear
if
you
read
the
word
"under"
to
mean
governed
by.
it's
very
fuzzy
if
you
read
the
word
"under"
to
be
as
defined
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if...
couldn't
one
counter
with
the
argument
that
why
would
congress
single
out
this
small
category
of
agency
proceedings
for
different
treatment
from
all
others
when
the
equities
would
seem
to
be
the
same
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
seem
to
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
without
saying
a
word
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
cases
in
which
the
government's
position
would
not
be
substantially
justified
are
a
very
small
number
of
the
total
universe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
they
budget
about
100
times
as
much
money
for
this
statute
as
they've
actually
spent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they've
failed
by
about
99
percent.
