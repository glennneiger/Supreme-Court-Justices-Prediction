justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
a
case
in
this
court
that
says
that
ins
proceedings
are
not
under
the
apa?
what
is
that...
morello?
marcello.
or
marcello?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
a
proceeding
under
the
apa
have
any...
what
does
it
mean
to
say
under
the
apa?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
does
"under"
mean
in
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
speaking
of
regulations,
congress
has
never
taken
issue
with
the
department
of
justice
regulation
on
this
matter,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
who
is
the
officer...
is
the
fee
statute
administered
by
the
department
of
justice?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say
that
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
authority
to
issue
regulations
under
the
fee
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may...
that
may
be
so,
but
do
you
say
that
any
regulation
of
the
attorney
general
under
this
statute
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
he
does
have
a
regulatory
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
he's
quite
mistaken
in
this
case,
but
congress
has
never
taken
issue
with
the
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
think
they
focused
on
the
two
cases
you
mentioned,
i
would
think
they
focused
on
the
issue
and
at
the
same
time
didn't
disturb
the
attorney
general's
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
regulation
might
change
and
go
back
to
the
marcello
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
erwin
decision
last
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
narrow
reading
of
waivers
is...
that
rule
is
still
in
place?
