justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
soloway,
i
mean,
that's
all...
yes,
i
mean,
it's
very
sympathetic,
but
the
fact
is
even
in
criminal
trials,
when
someone
is
wrongly
prosecuted,
and
it
turns
out
there
was
no
basis
for
the
prosecution,
eaja
does
not
reimburse
the
wrongfully
prosecuted
criminal
defendant.
although
he
may
have
spent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
his
defense,
he's
not
reimbursed,
is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
we're
here
to
read
this
statute.
is
this
one
of
those
instances
that's
reimbursed
or
one
that
isn't?
there
are
some
very
touching
situations
that
are
not
reimbursed.
this
may
be
one
of
them.
can
we
talk
about
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
what
does
it
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
maybe
they
more
resemble,
in
fact,
some
of
our
opinions
have
said
that
they,
and
we've
accorded
some
protections
that
are
otherwise
accordable
in
criminal
proceedings.
i
mean,
we've
analogized
them
on
occasion...
being
deported
to
criminal
proceedings.
and
if
they're
analogized
to
that
rather
than
other
554
proceedings,
then
there'd
be
no
compensation.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
not
a
right
to
have
counsel
paid
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
these
hearings
are
not
conducted
in
accordance
with
that
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
requirement
that
was
at
issue
in
marcello?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
requirement,
the
issue
is
whether
the
requirement
exists.
you're
just
saying
that
voluntarily
the
government
may
be
complying
with
it,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
requirement
that
marcello
addressed
does
not
exist.
and
if
the
requirement
does
not
exist,
then
these
things
are
not
really
under
554.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
understand
your
position
correctly
that...
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
an
agency
is
conducting
its
proceedings...
happens
to
be...
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
section
554,
even
though
it's
not
obligated
to,
and
even
though
it
doesn't
say
i
am
trying
to
conduct
it
pursuant
to
554.
if
it
just
happens
to
be
doing
that,
eaja
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i?
in
response
to
my
question,
i
gather
then,
what
you
would
say
is
if
the
statute
requires
a
hearing
to
be
on
the
record,
any
statute
requires
that
there
be
an
on-the-record
hearing,
and
if
the
agency
chooses,
although
it
is
not
obliged,
to
conduct
that
on-the-record
hearing
pursuant
to
554,
then
eaja
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
i
don't
know
how
you
reconcile
marcello,
because
that
is
exactly
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
have
a
requirement
of
an
on-the-record
hearing.
we
have
the
supreme
court
holding
that
the
agency
is
not
obliged
to
comply
with
all
the
requirements
of
554.
but
nonetheless,
you
tell
us,
it
is
complying
with
all
the
requirements
of
554,
and
therefore,
it's
under
554.
isn't
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
marcello
requirement
is
not
in
554
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
(d)
that
says
the
employee
presides
at
the
reception
of
evidence,
shall
make
the
recommended
decision,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
except
to
the
extent
required
for
the
disposition
of
ex
parte
matters.
such
an
employee
may
not...
that
is
the
employee
who
presides
at
the
reception
of
evidence...
may
not
be
responsible
to
or
subject
to
the
supervision
or
direction
of
an
employee
or
agent
engaged
in
the
performance
of
investigative
or
prosecuting
functions
for
an
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
type
of
thing
that
was
involved
in
marcello?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
indeed.
it
is
exactly
what
was
involved
in
marcello.
and
it
is
exactly
within
554,
isn't
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
like
a
good
answer.
what
do
you
do
about
the
social
security
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
really
troubled
with
the
legislative
history
part
of
it.
i'm
asking
for
your
opinion
on
whether...
and
other
social
security
proceedings
are
not
at
all
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
means
that,
the
social
security
act,
there
should
be
no
fees
under
the
social
security.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean
if
your
argument
is
consistent,
that's
the
result
it
would
lead
to,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
precisely
that
problem
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
don't
you?
i
think
the
board
proceedings
are
governed
by
the
nlra,
which
predated
the
apa
and
tracks
it
to
some
extent.
and
you
would
say
that
they
are
under...
are
those
proceedings
under
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
going
to
have
to
start
reading
your
footnotes,
if
they're
important
enough
to
bring
up
in
oral
argument.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
thanks
very
much.
[laughter]
