mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
question
presented
is
left
unresolved
by
the
statutory
text
that
congress
enacted.
the
very
purpose
of
a
definition
section
in
a
statute
is
to
delimit
the
scope
of
the
operative
terms
that
the
definition
section
undertakes
to
define.
here
the
operative
term
on
which
petitioner
must
rely
in
section
504(a)
is
"adversary
adjudication
by
the
agency".
and
subsection
(b)
of
the
same
section,
504,
defines
that
term
as
an
adjudication
under
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that's
a
close
question,
the...
but
i...
only
because
procedures
adopted
by
regulation
now
have
brought
the
administrative
deportation
proceedings
closer,
and
very
close,
to
what
is
described
in
section
554.
but
there
has
been
no
pertinent
statutory
change
since
marcello
against
bonds
was
decided
in
1955.
so
as
far
as
statutory
requirements
are
concerned,
the
same
discrepancies
occur
in
the
statutory
obligations
between
what
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
provide
and
what
section
554
provides.
and
our
position
is
that
eaja
should
not
be
interpreted,
and
there
is
not
indication
that
eaja
was
intended
to
deter
agencies
from
voluntarily
adopting
procedures
that
more
closely
conform
to
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
by
imposing
a
cost
on
that
kind
of
agency
procedural
reform
by
making
eaja
fees
kick
in.
and
indeed,
the
very
authority
that
petitioner
cites,
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states,
came
to
that
same
conclusion
after
receiving
comments
on
their
proposed
model
rule.
and
in
issuing
the
final
model
rule
at
the
page
of
the
federal
register
we
cite
in
our
brief,
volume
46,
page
32901,
they
say
quite
specifically
after
discussing
this
problem
of
the
possibility
of
deterrence
of
voluntary
adoption
of
the
improved
procedures,
we
have
decided,
therefore,
to
drop
the
provision
of
the
draft
rules
suggesting
that
awards
will
be
available
and
agencies
voluntarily
use
the
procedures
described
in
section
554.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the...
in
the
1985
reenactment
of
eaja,
there
was
a
reference
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
reports
to
a
procedure
under
the
social
security
act,
which
was
a
pilot
program
that
has
now
been
entirely
discontinued
as
of
1987.
we
describe
that
in
some
detail
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
in
sullivan
against
hudson
in
this
court.
that's
no.
88-616.
footnote
25
in
that
brief
explains
that
after
a
district
court
decision
called
solling
against
bowen,
criticizing
the
adoption
of
this
pilot
program
as
unauthorized
by
statute
and
saying
that
the
statue
requires
proceedings
in
which
the
secretary
is
not
represented,
and
therefore,
wholly
outside
of
the
eaja
context.
the
secretary,
as
we
explained
at
52
federal
register
17286,
discontinued
in
1987
that
pilot
program
all
together.
now,
apparently
the
committee
thought
that
adjudications
under
that
pilot
program
were
governed
by
554.
that
is
not
definitively
resolved
what
the
rationale
was
for
the
committee
saying
that
it
thought
that
such
social
security
hearings
would
be
covered,
but
that
has
become
a
moot
point
in
light
of
the
discontinued
use
of
that
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
not
at
all
covered.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
the
question
in
this
case
is
only
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
authorization
of
the
award
of
fees
for
administrative
adversary
adjudications,
defined
as
adjudications
under
section
554.
so
we
have
explained
in
detail
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief
that
throughout
section
504,
the
indisputable,
repeated
usage
of
the
word
"under"
in
conjunction
with
another
section
of
the
united
states
code,
or
another
provision
of
law,
the
indisputable
usage
is
that
it
means
governed
by
that
provision
or
subject
to
that
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
a
question
left
open
in
this
court's
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
know
whether
this
now
discontinued
procedure
was
subject
to
section
554
or
not.
this
court's
decision
in
richardson
against
perales
left
that
question
open,
and
it
had
never
been
definitively
determined.
and
there
will
not
be
an
occasion
now
to
determine
it,
because
the
program
is
discontinued.
so
we
don't
know
whether
that
was
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
parallel
procedures
would
not
do
it,
but
they
would
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
section
554
would
also
apply.
they
might
by
implication
be
construed
to
exclude
the
separate
application
of
section
554,
but
that
would
be
a
question
to
be
litigated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
can't
say
that
i've
looked
into
that
precise
question
in
connection
with
this
case.
but
i
think
the
statutory
criterion
for
the
award
of
fees
is
very
clear.
they
are
available
for
adjudications
that
are
governed
by
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that...
there
are
barriers
to
reading
it
that
way,
mr.
justice.
and
we
think
they
are
insuperable
barriers.
i
mentioned
one
of
them
to
you
already,
that
throughout
that
section,
554,
the
word
12
of
our
brief,
page
14.
we
collected
all...
many
examples
of
this.
indisputably,
they
have
to
mean
governed
by,
subject
to.
and
the
contention
would
be
that
this
one,
and
this
one
alone,
is
different.
and
indeed--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
equities
may--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
equities
may
not
be
the
same.
if
congress
were
to
give
specific
attention
to
the
question
of
administrative
deportation
proceedings,
and
i
don't
want
to
belittle
the
utility
of
counsel
in
such
proceedings,
but
congress
might
well
come
to
the
conclusion
that
applying
eaja
to
these
proceedings
would
not
be
the
best
way
to
address
this
problem.
there
are
more
than
100,000
such
proceedings
conducted
each
year
by
the
92
immigration
judges
of
the
ins.
and
the
vast
majority
of
these
proceedings...
everyone
i've
talked
with
there
estimates
that
it's
upwards
of
90
percent...
the
question
of
deportability
is
either
conceded
by
the
alien
or
very
quickly
resolved
against
the
alien,
and
the
whole
issue
becomes
a
claim
by
the
alien
for
political
asylum
or
for
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
congress
might
conclude
that
because
these
all
are
a
matter
that
involve
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
government,
and
they're
all
matters
on
which
the
burden
of
proof
has
shifted
to
the
alien,
that
there
would
be
very
few
cases
in
which
the
government's
position
could
fairly
be
said
not
to
be
substantially
justified.
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
lot
of
litigation
about
that
and
a
lot
of
courts
awarding
fees.
but
congress
could
conclude
that
this
isn't
really
the
tool.
and
it
might
also
be
concerned
that
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
in
favor
of
aliens
in
these
proceedings
might
be
deterred
if
it
could
become
a
drain
on
the
agency's
budget
through
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
true
that
the
costs
have
not
reached
the
initial
estimates
that
were
made
when
it
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
but
there
are
reasons
why,
if
congress
gave
attention
to
this
question
it
might
conclude
that
there
are
better
and
more
effective
ways
of
meeting
a
need
for
the
provision
of
counsel
in
this
proceedings
than
by
applying
eaja,
and
that
eaja
might
not
be
well
suited
to
it.
that
is
a
matter
that
congress
simply
has
not
addressed.
and
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
another
barrier
which
we
think
is
a
very
strong
barrier
to
the
alternative
interpretation
that
petitioner
espouses
and
that
you
have
queried
about.
and
that
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
those
must
be
strictly
construed
in
the
first
place.
and
that,
in
this
context,
really
fairly
precludes
departure
from
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
554>
["],
to
a
more
expansive,
unusual
meaning
of
the
words
554>
["].
and
they
must...
in
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
express
rather
than
applied,
which
it
seems
to
us,
fairly
precludes
analogy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
erwin
decision
was
one
in
which
congress
had
clearly
subjected
the
category
of
cases
to
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
only
question
was
whether
the
ordinary
rules
of
the
road
for
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
usual
tolling
rules
of
the
road,
would
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
it,
and
has
referred
to
it
approvingly
in
an
analogous
contexts
because
ultimately
it
is
a
rule
that
assures
against
intrusion
by
the
courts
into
the
legislative
function
of
determining
what
claims
on
the
public
fisk
should
be
honored
and
what
claims
should
not.
of
course
an
argument
can
be
made
that
this
would
be
a
worthwhile
use
of
public
funds.
but
there
are
many
requests
for
arguably
worthwhile
uses
of
public
funds
and
congress
has
to
determine
how
to
apportion
the
limited
resources
that
are
available.
and
in
at
least
two
decisions
of
last
term
that
come
to
mind,
the
united
states
against
dolm,
and
opm
against
richmond,
the
court
emphasized
that
this
is
the
essence
of
the
legislative
function
under
our
constitutional
system.
and
in
any
event,
it
was
the
well-established
principal
at
the
time
congress
was
drafting
eaja
and
that
established
the
rules
of
statutory
draftsmanship
under
which
congress
put
together
this
text,
with
its
definition
section
specifying
the
proceedings
for
which
fee-shifting
would
be
available.
so
that
is
the
proper
way
to
read
the
statutory
text,
and
it
was
equally
well
established
at
the
time
this
statute
was
drafted
by
this
court's
1955
decision
in
marcello
against
bonds,
that
administrative
deportation
proceedings
are
not
proceedings
governed
by
section
554
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
have
also
collected
in
our
brief,
in
footnote
26
on
pages
28
and
29,
some
examples
of
the
many
uncertainties
that
would
be
opened
up
if,
instead
of
the
terms
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
congress
used
being
the
criterion,
a
more
elastic
criterion
of
procedures
functionally
similar
to
section
554
procedures
were
to
be
adopted.
this
would--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
have
not
yet
refrained
from
writing
footnotes,
although
i
don't
take
issue
with
those
who
have.
so
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
some
opinions
of
this
court
are
now
coming
out
without
footnotes,
and
they're
a
pleasure
to
read.
[laughter]
in
any
event--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--some
of
the
footnotes
are
also
a
pleasure
to
read.
[laughter]
so,
in
essence,
our
position
is
that
the
terms
of
eaja's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
govern
here.
it
happens
that
there's
also
another
barrier
to
recovery
in
administrative
deportation
proceedings.
and
that
is
that
a
holding
to
that
effect
would
require
construing
eaja
to
repeal
by
implication
section
1362
of
title
viii.
this
is
to
us
illustrative
of
the
difficulties
that
are
encountered
by
straying
beyond
the
terms
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
congress
utilized.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we're
submitting
our
case.
