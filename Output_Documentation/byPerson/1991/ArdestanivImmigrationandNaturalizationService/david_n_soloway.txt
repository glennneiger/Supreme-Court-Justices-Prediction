mr.
david
n.
soloway
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
addresses
the
applicability
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
or
the
eaja,
to
deportation
hearings
before
an
immigration
judge.
more
particularly,
this
case
deals
with
5
u.s.c.
section
504,
that
prong
of
the
eaja
that
applies
to
administrative
proceedings.
and
those
proceedings,
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
eaja
fees,
the
government
must
be
represented
by
counsel.
in
this
case,
the
government,
the
immigration
service,
was
represented
by
their
trial
counsel.
in
addition,
it
is
required
that
the
statute
say
that
this
proceeding
be
determined.
it
must
be
determined
on
the
record.
that
is
the
case
here.
and
in
addition,
the
position
of
the
government
must
be
not
even
substantially
justified.
here
the
immigration
service
produced
no
evidence
at
all
in
support
of
its
position.
the
eaja
was
enacted
to
further
specific
purposes.
one
was
to
aid
victims,
to
help
avoid
the
situation
where
someone
might
have
to
surrender
their
rights
and
succumb
to
unjustified
government
action
just
because
of
the
expense
of
hiring
an
attorney.
mrs.
ardestani's
petition
for
asylum
was
wrongfully
denied
and
she
was
unjustifiably
placed
in
deportation
proceedings,
proceedings
so
complex
and
with
consequences
so
harsh,
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
engage
an
attorney.
another
specific
purpose
of
the
eaja
statute
is
to
deter
unjustified
government
action.
and
that's
done
by
holding
the
agency
itself
accountable.
the
service
did
not
dispute
the
secretary
of
state's
determination
that
mrs.
ardestani
had
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
were
she
to
be
returned
to
iran
under
the
khomeini
regime.
instead,
the
service
unwarrantedly
asserted
that
mrs.
ardestani
had
firmly
resettled
in
a
third
country.
they
asserted
that
even
though
she
had
been
in
a
third
country
for
only
3
days,
staying
in--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
eaja
provides
broadly
for
protection
for
people
who
have
been
subjected
to
severe
agency
misconduct.
and
of
all
the
possible
government
agencies,
and
of
all
the
possible
agency
proceedings,
deportation
proceedings
are
the
ones
that
most
specifically
meet
the
eaja
context.
they're
the
ones
where
the
most
harsh
consequences
meted
out
by
any
agency
are
meted
out...
consequences
that
may
be
tantamount
to
banishment
or
exile,
or
in
the
words
of
justice
brandeis,
"the
loss
of
life
and
property
and
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
"
this
is
particularly
so
in
the
context
of
asylum
where,
as
here,
it
had
been
determined
that
the
refugee
would
be
subjected
to
persecution.
moreover,
persons
in
deportation
proceedings
are
the
very
people
for
whom
the
remedial
measures
of
the
eaja
most
perfectly
are
met.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
this
statute
says
that
adversary
adjudications,
that
is
the
adjudications
for
which
eaja
applies,
are
those
that
are
under
section
554.
554>
["]
is
a
term
that
has
been
the
focus
of
the
various
circuit
courts,
and
it's
a
term
upon
which
the
majority
and
the
dissentient
court
below
focused.
it's
an
ordinary,
common
preposition.
it's
a
word
with
perhaps
as
many
as
25
meanings
as
a
preposition.
in
order
for
this
court
to
properly
glean
the
correct
meaning
of
the
definition
554>
["],
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
this
court
has
held
that
interpretation
of
a
statute
is
not
an
inert
exercise
in
grammatical
or
literary
composition.
instead,
we
have
to
look
at
what
was
the
eaja
statute
about.
and,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
way
that
deportation
hearings
are
precisely
those
that
fit
that
statutory
scheme.
554>
["],
those
words
are
merely
a
cross
reference
to
the
definitional
provisions
in
section
554.
it
merely
means
that
congress
was
cross-referencing
and
importing
into
the
statute
the
definition
in
section
554.
that
definition
requires...
that
definition
provides
that
a
statute
must
require
that
the
hearing
be
determined
on
the
record.
in
addition,
there
are
six
express
exemptions,
none
of
which
arguably
are
involved
in
this
case.
confronted
by
a
foreign
language,
confronted
by
the
most
harsh
consequences
meted
out,
confronted
by
a
strange
culture
where
the
necessity
of
having
a
lawyer
be
involved
are
at
its
apex,
deportation
proceedings
are
most
precisely
in
concert
with
the
eaja
provisions.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
your
honor,
of
course,
if
they
were
tantamount
to
criminal
proceedings,
were
this
court
to
so
hold,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
may
be
invoked.
the...
that's
not
something
that's
being
urged
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
here
particularly,
we're
talking
about
someone
who
has
engaged
counsel
at
their
own
expense
and
merely
a
fee
shifting
in
those
adversary
adjudications
where
the
government
has
been
abusive.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
well,
i'm
talking
about
appointed
counsel,
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
if
i
understood
your
earlier
question
correctly,
you
were
suggesting
that
were
these
to
be
viewed
as
criminal
proceedings,
deportation
proceedings,
because
they
mete
out
consequences
that
may
be
as
harsh
or
harsher
than
many
criminal
sanctions.
what
seems
to
follow
is
that
perhaps
a
person,
an
indigent
person,
is
entitled
to
appointed
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment,
although
the
ardestani
case
doesn't
specifically
require
this
court
to
address
that.
however,
in
looking
at
the
statutory
scheme
and
in
understanding
what
this
statute
means,
it's
helpful
to
note
that
in
the
legislative
history
there
was
a
change
in
the
senate
bill
from
554>
["],
and
the
joint
explanatory
statement
of
the
conference
committee,
which
may
be
particularly
probative
because
it
represents
the
views
of
both
the
house
and
congress,
stated
that
adversary
adjudications
were
those,
and
i
quote,
are
defined
under
the
administrative
procedures
act,
where
the
agency
takes
a
position
through
representation
by
counsel.
but
it's
probably
a
lot
more
instructive
for
this
court
to
note
that
there
were
no
discussions
about
whether
or
not
different
agencies,
different
categories
of
agencies
were
to
be
within
the
scope
of
eaja.
instead,
eaja
was
a
broad
remedial
statute,
and
the
discussions
were
about
categories
of
proceedings,
those
that
were...
pardon
me...
trial
like,
versus
those
that
are
rule
making
or
price
fix...
rate
fixing.
in
addition
to
that,
in
order
to
get...
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
common
preposition
under,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
eaja,
on
its
face,
recognizes
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
as
an
authority
on
the
eaja
implementation.
the
eaja...
pardon
me...
the
acus
chairman
is
required
to
be
consulted
with
in
order
for--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
more
important
than
the
rejection
of
the
senate
language
eaja
recognized
the
acus
as
an
authority
on
the
subject
of
the
eaja,
and
there
the
chairman
stated
that
questions
of
eaja's
coverage
should
turn
on
substance.
the
fact
that
a
party
has
endured
the
burden
and
expense
of
a
formal
hearing,
rather
than
technicalities.
this
is
particularly
important
because
that's
precisely
what
we're
faced
with
here...
a
suggestion
that
a
hyper-technical
interpretation
of
the
word
eaja
statute
to
those
particularly
in
need
of
the
statute
is
to
be
compared
to
the
functional
and
more
appropriate
interpretation
as
"as
defined
in"...
in
other
words,
just
mere
importation,
a
cross-reference
of
those
terms.
and
for
that
reason,
the
burden
should
be
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
congress
intended
not
to
have
merely
a
cross-reference
to
import
those
definitional
words,
but
the
government
really
should
have
the
burden
to
show
that
congress
intended
to
cover
and
protect
people
from
all
sorts
of
agency
adjudications,
but
not
those
particularly
in
need
of
it
in
deportation
proceedings.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
eaja
statute
applies
to
certain
social
security
cases,
those
in
which
the
government,
as
represented
by
counsel--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--your
honor,
the
practice...
let
me
answer
your
question
directly.
i
don't
believe
that
question
has
ever
been
presented.
it's
been
so
clear
on
its
face
that
it's
never
been
challenged.
in
those
instances
where
social
security
proceedings
have
counsel
representing
the
government,
the
eaja
applies.
there
have
been
fees
award...
awarded
and
there's
not
been
a
challenge.
and
the
government
in
this
case
hasn't
urged
a
different
interpretation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1985
reenactment,
there's
a
specific
example
used
of
application
of
the
eaja
statute.
in
that
explicit
example,
the
congress...
the
legislative
history
states
in
those
instances...
for
example,
social
security
proceedings...
where
the
government
is
represented
by
counsel,
then
in
those
events...
in
those
events
the
eaja
will
apply.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
except
for
the
interpretation
and
the
same
reasoning
that's
urged
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
mr.
justice
stevens,
that's
largely
correct,
but
there's
even
more
to
the
argument
than
that.
in
1971,
this
case,
in
the
richardson
v.
perales
case,
declined
to
decide
the
distinction
whether
or
not
social
security
proceedings
are
technically
governed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
or
instead
by
the
more
specialized
version
of
the
apa,
namely
the
social
security
act.
that
arcane
legal
distinction
has
never
been
resolved.
that
debate
has
never
been
terminated.
yet
congress
clearly
wasn't
interested
in
whether
or
not
social
security
proceedings
were
technically
governed
by
that
statute.
instead,
they
simply
wished
to
categorize
by
types
of
proceedings,
rather
than
by
agencies
or
by
governing
statutes.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
well,
justice
white,
the
marcello
case
was
not
an
eaja
case,
but
there
this
court
was
called
to
look
upon
a
divergence,
a
unique
divergence
that
existed
36
years
ago
between
the
immigration
nationality
act
and
the
apa.
only
in
the
immigration
act
could
one
person
have
both
adjudicatory
and
prosecutorial
functions.
and
this
court
ruled
that
in
those
hearing
provisions,
that
differed
from
the
apa's
hearing
provisions,
that
the
ina
proceed...
ina
provisions
would
prevail.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
your
honor,
the
statute
here
says
under
section
554.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
be
meaning
under
section
554
as
opposed
to
under--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--under
section
554,
the
definition
of
an
adversary
adjudication
is
defined
under
section
554.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
it
merely
means,
your
honor,
a
cross
reference,
as
defined
in
that
section,
in
accordance
with
that
section.
it
merely
is
a
phrase
used
to
transport,
if
you
would,
the
definitional
section
with
its
exceptions
into
the
eaja
statute.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
they
are,
your
honor.
there...
all
of
the
statutes
are
identical.
there's
the
requirement
that
determinations
be
made
on
the
record.
there's
the
entitlement
to
a
personal
appearance
and
reasonable
notice.
all
of
the
section
554
elements,
all
of
them,
without
exception,
are
in
place
in
deportation
hearings.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
that's
no
longer
a
distinction.
that
distinction
has
evaporated.
no
longer
do
deportation
adjudicative
officers
have
prosecutorial
functions.
it
no
longer
exists.
were
marcello
to
be--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
if
the
analysis
is
going
to
look
at
what
takes
place,
what
are
the
rights
of
people
in
deportation
proceedings,
and
are
they
different,
can
they
rely
upon,
are
they
in
some
functional
and
meaningful
way
different
than
those
hearings
conducted
under
the
technical
governance
of
the
apa,
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
and
the
fact
that
the
marcello
distinction
has
long
since
evaporated
is
an
important
fact.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
it
was
not
a
statute,
your
honor.
it
was
a
regulation.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
and
there's
been
no
need
for
a
statute
since
that's
been
the
long-standing
practice
for...
in
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
your
honor,
if
you're
specifically
referring
to
the
1985
reenactment,
which
has
been
raised
by
the
service
in
this
case,
it's
important
to
note
that
in
1984,
before
that
reenactment,
there
were
two
circuit
court
of
opinion
decisions
that
looked
at
the
terms
554>
["]
and
interpreted
those
to
be...
to
mean
simply
as
defined
in
that
section...
namely,
requiring
that
a
hearing
be
determined
on
the
record
and
that
government
be
represented
by
counsel.
and
while
neither
of
those
were
deportation--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--yes,
your
honor...
well,
in
the
setting
of
deportation
proceedings--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--the
fee
statute
itself
states
that
the
agencies
may
promulgate
their
rules
after
consultation
with
the
acus
chairman.
and
in
fact,
the
acus
chairman
has
taken
a
position
that's
completely
at
odds
with
the
interpretation
reached
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
no.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
no.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
your
honor--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--your
honor,
while
that's
true,
that
the
congress
has
not
focused
upon
the
attorney
general's
regulation--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--i
suggest
that
it's
just
as
plausible
that
congress
didn't
look
at
either
the
seventh
circuit
or
the
eighth
circuit's
interpretation,
or
this
regulation.
it
had...
the
issue
of
eaja
fees
being
within
the
scope
of
deportation
hearings
had
simply
never
been
adjudicated,
had
never
come
up
through
the
courts.
the
escobar
ruiz
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
came
after
the
1985
reenactment.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
section
554
requires,
it
states
that
the
statute
must
mandate
that
a
hearing
be
required
on
the
record
and
the
mere
fact
that
an
agency
might
in
its
discretion
allow
hearings
to
be
determined
on
the
record,
would
not
place
it
within
the
ambit
of
the
eaja.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
i
think
there
could
be
no
dispute
that
if
the
statute
on
its
face
used
the
more
restrictive
language
than
is
even
necessary,
then,
yes,
it
would
be
within
the
ambit
of
eaja.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe...
if
i
understand
you
correctly--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--justice
scalia,
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
urging
upon
this
court.
what...
i'd
like
to
try
to
make
this
more
clear,
if
i
may.
the
eaja
statute
says
that
the
hearing...
must
be
required
by
statute
to
be
determined
on
the
record.
that
is
the
one
that
has
to
be
specified
in
the
statute
because
that's
what
eaja
says.
however,
the
other
aspects
about
whether
the
adjudicative
officer
can
be
the
same
person
as
the
prosecutorial
officer
is
simply
not
something
that...
upon
which
eaja
pivots.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
parallel
between
social
security
act
proceedings
which
are...
where
it
has
not
been
determined
to
be
under
the
apa--
mr.
david
n.
soloway
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
it
is
related
to
marcello
in
that
way.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
but,
your
honor,
it's
not
within
the
definitional
part
of
section
554.
in
other
words,
554
also
deals
with
the
type
of
notice,
the
method
of
notice,
things
like
that.
instead,
the
importance
of
554
and
the
reference
to
554
is
merely
to
import
the
definition.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
well,
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
the
statute...
the
eaja
statute
is
using
section
554
only
for
a
definition.
there's
no
reason
either
from
the
context
of
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history,
or
any
other
plausible
reason
to
view
those
additional
requirements.
but
even
if
you
did,
they're
all
met
here.
all
of
them
are
met.
marcello
doesn't
stand
in
the
way
here
because
the
difference
that
had
existed
36
years
ago
no
longer
exists,
and
didn't
exist
in
mrs.
ardestani's
case.
the
entire
panoply,
the
full...
all
of
section
554,
if
you
will,
has
been
met
in
the
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
the
one
that's
been
pointed
out
by
justice
scalia
is
by
regulation.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
even
if
that
were
the
case,
justice
white,
you'd
still
have
the
requirements
of
section
554,
the
definition
that's
in
554,
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
on
the
record.
that
would
still
be
met.
in
addition,
the
interpretation
that's
urged,
a
meaningful,
functional
definition
that
includes
those
most
in
need
of
the
eaja,
the
ones
that...
for
which
the
eaja
goals
are
most
precisely
in
concert,
that
interpretation
provides
a
bright
line,
an
easy
application
for
the
courts
rather
than
require
the
courts
to
look
to
richardson
v.
perales
analyses
or
marcello
analyses,
as
has
been
discussed
this
afternoon.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
if
there
are
no
questions.
mr.
david
n.
soloway
thank
you.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
acus
exemption
or
discussion
about
voluntary
compliance.
i
read
from
the
federal
register,
"congress
has
provided
that
private
parties
in
disputes
with
the
federal
government
are
entitled
to
hearings
as
a
right,
and
others,
for
whatever
reasons,
it
has
been
determined
that
hearings
may
be
provided
at
the
discretion
of
the
government.
"
"on
reflection
we
have
concluded
that
it
is
more
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
legislation
not
to
cover
proceedings
of
the
latter
type
than
to
include
them.
"
"we
have
decided,
therefore,
to
drop
the
provision
of
the
draft
rules
suggesting
that
awards
be
available
when
agencies
voluntarily
comply
with
the
procedures
described
in
section
554.
"
that
reference
to
voluntary
acceptance
of
procedures
precisely
deals
with
the
requirement
of
hearings
being
required
to
be
on
the
record.
in
addition
to
that,
i
wish
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
that
there's
been
no
suggestion
of
why
an
agency
adjudication--
