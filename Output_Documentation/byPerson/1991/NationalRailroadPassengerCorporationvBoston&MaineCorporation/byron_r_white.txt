justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
really
going
to
win
very
much
if
you
win
here
on
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
just
have
to...
it's
going
to
go
back
to
the
commission,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
they
find
that
boston
and
maine
is
so
intransigent
nobody
should
deal
with
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
part
of
your
case
that
amtrak
needed
the
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
hardly
answers
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
boston...
they
could
not
get
out
of
just
a
trackage
rights
arrangement
with
boston
and
maine,
what
they
had
to
have;
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
who...
the
commission
never
made
that
finding--
justice
byron
r.
white
--did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
it
make
the
kind
of
a
finding
i
just
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
it...
did
they
say
they
needed
it
in
order
to
convey
to
somebody
that
was
more
reliable
than
boston
and
maine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
i'll
just
have
to
read
the...
look
at
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
didn't
say
that,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
it
made
that
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
judge
ginsburg
didn't
make
that
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
disagree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
need...
you
could
say,
well,
maybe
they
found
need
but
they
didn't
give
an
adequate
explanation
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
the
question
is
need,
why
did
amtrak
need
the
fee
when
in
the
long
run
it
gave
it
back
to
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
they
didn't
need
to
own
the
fee
for
any
more
than
a
day,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
they...
why
did
they
have
to
take
the
fee
away
from
the
boston
and
maine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
don't
make
these
determinations
on
this
record.
the
court...
icc
should
have
done
it's
work,
and
we
think
counsel
is
very
persuasive.
the
only
thing
is,
counsel
hasn't
got
the
authority
to
present
this
kind
of
an
issue
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
need
is
presumed.
