chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
90-1419,
national
railroad
passenger
corporation,
et
al.
v.
boston
and
maine
corporation,
inc.,
and
90-1769,
interstate
commerce
commission
and
united
states
v.
boston
and
maine
corporation,
et
al.--
mr.
roberts,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
everybody
agree
that
the
congressional
amendment
applies
to
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
same
way
thomas
jefferson
read
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
section
are
you
reading
now,
mr.
roberts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
402(a)
and
402(b).
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(d)?
and
the
basic
statute
is
45
u.s.c.
section
545
that's
set
out
at
page
136a
of
the
petition
for
the
writ?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
goldbloom,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
goldbloom,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
statute
says
that
unless
the
commission
finds
(a)
and
(b)
under
section
1,
then
the
need
of
the
corporation
for
the
property
shall
be
deemed
to
be
established?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
term
need
of
the
corporation
as
used
after
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
does
not
include
the
requirement
for
inter-state...
inter-city
rail
service
and
it
doesn't
suffice
to
dispense
with
the
negotiation
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precisely
is
the
statutory
language
which
you
rely
upon
to
require
the
finding
you
just
referred
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
inability
to
agree
is
one
of
them,
you
would
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
is
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
go
into
this
particular
aspect
of
the
case
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
goldbloom.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1419,
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
versus
boston
and
maine
corporation
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
