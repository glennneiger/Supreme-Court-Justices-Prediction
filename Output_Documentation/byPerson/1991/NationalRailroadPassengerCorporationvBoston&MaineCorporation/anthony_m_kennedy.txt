justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
contention
that
the
review
that
is
required
of
the
fcc
was
not
undertaken
in
this
case,
as
you
define
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought...
well,
i
thought
you
read
it
as
that
they
had
to
demonstrate
that
the
particular
property
interest
which
they
needed
and
which
is
owned
by
the
railroad
is
the
one
that
they
need
to
condemn...
they
want
to
condemn.
i
guess
it
comes
down
to
the
same
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
there's
no
contest
in
this
record
that
the
trackage
was
needed
and
needed
in
an
upgraded
condition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
there's
no
disagreement
that
negotiations
broke
down.
we
can
argue
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
good-faith
offer,
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
were
unsuccessful.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
it
can
do
that
through
condemnation
and
conveyance
to
a
third
person,
why
isn't
that
a
fulfillment
of
its
statutory
duties
under
the
policy
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
been
payment
of
fair
compensation,
of
course,
by
definition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
cases
involve
the
railroad
passenger
service
act
of
1970
and
that
act
created
a
corporation
called
the
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
but
it
is
better
known
as
amtrak.
amtrak's
purpose
is
to
provide
inner
city
rail
passenger
service
and
it,
along
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
the
petitioners
in
these
consolidated
cases.
the
case
has
raised
questions
regarding
the
proper
interpretation
of
an
imminent
domain
provision
in
the
act.
amtrak's
montrealer
train
service
operates
between
washington
d.c.
and
montreal.
for
part
of
the
way,
the
train
at
one
time
operated
on
railroad
tracks
owned
by
the
boston
and
maine
corporation,
and
boston
and
maine
as
a
respondent
in
these
cases.
in
the
early
1980s,
amtrak
ran
into
difficulties
with
the
montrealer
service
which
eventually
forced
it
to
cancel
the
service
and
amtrak
claims
that
poor
maintenance
of
its
tracks
by
boston
and
maine
was
the
cause
of
the
problem.
amtrak
then
reached
an
agreement
with
central
vermont
railroad,
another
petitioner
here
and
a
competitor
of
boston
and
maine.
under
that
agreement,
amtrak
was
to
acquire
boston
and
maine's
tracks
and
transfer
them
to
central
vermont
in
exchange
for
the
use
of
the
track
and
a
promise
from
central
vermont
to
properly
maintain
them.
amtrak
requested
and
received
a
condemnation
order
from
the
icc
pursuant
to
an
imminent
domain
provision
in
the
act.
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
after
that
court
held
that
the
relevant
section
of
the
act
does
not
permit
condemnation
of
the
property
which
amtrak
intends
to
convey
to
a
third
party
following
condemnation.
and
the
court
held
that
rejecting
a
contra-interpretation
of
the
icc.
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
congress
amended
the
statute
to
add
a
sentence
stating
that
amtrak
was
authorized
to
re-convey
condemned
property.
the
court
of
appeals,
nonetheless,
denied
rehearing
holding
that
the
amendment
did
not
affect
its
reasoning.
the
icc's
condemnation
order
was
based
on
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
controlling
statute.
the
agency
relied
on
the
statutory
presumption
of
need
to
conclude
that
amtrak
had
established
its
entitlement
to
the
order.
in
so
doing
the
icc
implicitly
adapted
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
that
which
amtrak
was
permitted
to
make
a
judgment
regarding
its
need
for
the
property
sought
so
long
as
the
property
would
be
used
in
amtrak's
rail
operations.
we
hold
today
that
the
icc's
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
condemnation
provision
in
the
statute
and
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
setting
aside
the
icc
order.
the
icc
is
the
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
under
our
well-settled
doctrine,
the
icc's
interpretation
of
that
provision
is
entitled
to
great
deference
from
the
reviewing
court's.
the
judgment
of
he
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
thomas
join.
