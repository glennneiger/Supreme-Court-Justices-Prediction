mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
overturned
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
construction
of
a
statute
entrusted
to
the
commission
to
administer.
congress
acted
promptly
to
overturn
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
amending
the
statute
while
the
case
was
still
pending
on
rehearing.
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
stuck
to
its
guns
and
denied
rehearing.
this
court
should
reverse.
twenty
years
ago--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was
made
explicitly
applicable
to
any
case
pending
before,
during,
or
after
enactment
of
the
act.
twenty
years
ago
amtrak
inaugurated
its
montrealer
service
between
washington's
union
station
and
montreal.
the
train
traveled
through
vermont
and
new
hampshire
over
the
connecticut
river
line,
a
line
owned
over
some
portions
by
the
boston
and
maine
and
over
other
portions
by
the
central
vermont.
things
ran
smoothly
until
the
mid-1980's,
when
guilford
transportation
acquired
both
boston
and
maine
and
the
delaware
and
hudson
railway.
now,
the
delaware
and
hudson
owned
a
north-south
line
of
track
parallel
to
the
conn
river
line
west
of
lake
champlain
in
new
york
state.
as
a
result,
the
conn
river
line
diminished
in
importance
to
boston
and
maine
and
to
its
parent
guilford,
to
the
point
that
in
1987
boston
and
maine
listed
its
portion
of
the
conn
river
line
as
track
it
anticipated
abandoning.
conditions
on
the
line
deteriorated,
the
montrealer
slowed
to
a
crawl
over
the
boston
and
maine
segment,
and
in
1987
amtrak
cancelled
montrealer
service.
to
restore
that
service,
amtrak
determined
that
it
needed
to
rehabilitate
the
conn
river
line,
and
congress
appropriated
money
for
the
purpose.
amtrak
was
unable
to
agree
with
boston
and
maine
on
terms
under
which
it
felt
it
could
responsibly
invest
the
necessary
funds,
and
it
turned
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
relief.
it
sought
two
things
from
the
commission:
first,
an
order
authorizing
it
to
condemn
the
boston
and
maine
segment
for
just
compensation,
and
second
an
order
authorizing
it
to
then
reconvey
the
line
to
the
central
vermont,
which
had
agreed
to
pay
for
the
line,
to
rehabilitate
it
in
part
with
funds
provided
by
amtrak,
to
maintain
it
in
a
condition
suitable
for
amtrak's
passenger
service
for
20
years,
to
grant
amtrak
trackage
rights
for
that
period,
and
also
to
grant
the
boston
and
maine
trackage
rights
so
that
it
could
serve
its
existing
customers
on
the
line.
both
steps
in
this
transaction...
the
condemnation
and
the
reconveyance...
required
icc
approval.
amtrak
sought
approval
for
the
condemnation
under
section
402(d)
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act.
that
statute
specifies
that
if
amtrak
and
the
railroad
are
unable
to
agree
on
the
sale
of
property
owned
by
the
railroad
and
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
that
amtrak
may
seek
an
order
establishing
its
need
for
the
property
and
requiring
its
conveyance
on
reasonable
terms
and
conditions,
including
just
compensation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor.
of
course,
there's
quite
a
dispute
over
what
that
passage
means.
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
meant
basically
that
amtrak
could
not
get
by
with
anything
else,
and
what
it
reasoned
was
that
since
amtrak
didn't
retain
the
fee
interest
in
the
boston
and
maine
line,
that
it
didn't
require
it.
since
it
didn't
require
it,
it
couldn't
condemn
it
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
icc
reads
that
language...
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service...
to
mean
simply
that
the
property
that's
involved
must
be
put
to
use
by
amtrak
in
providing
that
service,
as
opposed
to
being
used
for
something
else.
the
language
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
mean
indispensable,
as
the
court
of
appeals
read
it,
as
the
boston
and
maine
reads
it.
this
is
a
familiar
usage
of
the
word
required.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
amtrak
decides
in
the
first
instance
whether
it
will
put
this
property
to
use
in
providing
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
and
if
that
is
in
fact
what
the
property
is
to
be
used
for,
that
statutory
mandate
is
satisfied.
the
commission
looks
to
make
sure
that
it's
being
used
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
and
then
that
is
sufficient.
nothing
in
the
statute
suggests
that
the
icc
is
to
engage
in
a
process
of
tearing
down
the
property
interest
to
the
least
restrictive
alternative,
and
in
fact
the
amendment,
of
course,
makes
clear
that
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
define
it,
i
don't
believe
so.
it
is
true
that
there
is
not
a
precise
finding
that
this
requirement
was
met,
but
there's
certainly
a
precise
finding
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission
that
the
boston
and
maine
interpretation
of
the
provision
is
not
the
correct
one.
there
is
also
certainly
findings
that
the
reason
amtrak
is
proceeding
is
to
restore
the
montrealer
service
to
put
this
line
of
track
to
use
in
providing
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
and
that
is
a
sufficient
finding
on
the
record.
what
the
amendment
said
in
1990
was
that
amtrak
may
reconvey
property
it
has
condemned
to
a
third
party
if
the
commission
finds
that
the
reconveyance
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
act.
now,
the
amendment
simply
makes
no
sense
unless
it
is
read
to
authorize
precisely
what
amtrak
did
here.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
amtrak...
if
amtrak
intended
to
reconvey
property,
it
couldn't
condemn
it.
the
amendment
says
amtrak
can
reconvey
property
it
has
condemned,
so
it
simply
cannot
be
the
case
that
the
reconveyance
dooms
the
condemnation
in
the
first
place.
in
our
opening
brief
we
challenge
the
respondent
to
come
up
with
an
explanation
of
what
the
amendment
means,
if
not
that
this
type
of
a
transaction
is
authorized.
it
came
up
with
no
explanation
in
its
brief,
and
it
will
not
be
able
to
come
up
with
an
explanation
here
this
afternoon.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
dead
stand-off
then
the
commission
under
chevron
is
entitled
to
deference
in
its
construction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
the
amendment
said...
what
the
court
of
appeals...
the
amendment
needs
to
be
understood
in
light
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
can't
condemn
property
that
you're
going
to
reconvey
because
the
reconveyance
proves
you
didn't
require
it.
what
the
amendment
says
is,
you
may
condemn...
you
may
reconvey
property
that
you
have
condemned.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
with
respect,
i
disagree.
the
language
of
the
amendment
makes
clear
that
it
is
not
an
answer
to
the
commission's
order
to
say
that
you
reconveyed
that,
therefore
the
condemnation
was
no
good
in
the
beginning,
because
the
amendment
makes
clear
that
amtrak
may
reconvey
property
it
has
condemned.
if
it
may
reconvey
property
it
has
condemned,
it
simply
cannot
be
the
case
that
the
reconveyance
dooms
the
condemnation
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
we
can
tell
that
amtrak
did
not
need
the
property
because
it
reconveyed
it,
and
the
amendment
at
least
undermines
that
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the...
going
back--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
let
me
turn
to
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
a
remand's
necessary
for
that
purpose,
because
under
chevron
the
decision
was
wrong
even
before
the
amendment.
the
statutory
phrase
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
was
read
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
read
by
boston
and
maine
to
mean
that
nothing
less
will
do,
but
that
is
not
the
only--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
and
quite
different
from
the
way
chief
justice
marshall
read
it
in
mccullough
against
maryland.
it's
a
familiar
usage
of
the
word
in
the
law.
necessary
is
a
synonym
for
required.
chief
justice
marshall
told
us
it
means
convenient
or
useful.
we've
cited
in
our
opening
brief
the
dictionary
definition
that
require
means
to
call
for
as
suitable
or
appropriate
in
a
particular
case,
as
in
it's
cold
outside.
if
you
go
out
you'll
require
an
overcoat.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
go
outside
if
you
don't
have
an
overcoat.
it
means
that
you'll
find
one
suitable
and
appropriate
if
you
do
go
outside.
the
error
in
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
i
think
is
clearest
if
you
look
at
section
402(d)
as
a
whole.
boston
and
maine
and
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision,
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
is
to
make
sure
that
amtrak
really
needs
what
it's
taking,
but
that's
exactly
what
the
next
sentence
of
the
statute
is
addressed
to
in
very
specific
terms.
the
next
sentence
says--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
referring
to
section
402(d),
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
page
1a.
the
first
sentence
contains
this
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
language,
but
the
next
sentence
in
the
statute
goes
on
to
say
that
amtrak's
need
for
the
property
shall
be
deemed
to
be
established
unless
the
commission
makes
two
contrary
findings.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
whether
amtrak
really
needs
this
property
as
opposed
to
some
other
property
is
addressed
in
the
second
sentence,
the
one
that
begins,
unless
the
commission
finds.
it
would
be
a
very
strange
statute
that
had
the
same
question
addressed
in
the
immediately
previous
sentence
under
the
vaguer
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
provision.
the
boston
and
maine
reading
of
the
phrase,
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
would
probably
never
be
satisfied.
nothing
is
ever
really
indispensable.
amtrak
can
get
from
washington
to
montreal
via
detroit
if
it
had
to,
and
in
any
even
the
phrase
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
is
at
least
susceptible
to
more
than
one
meaning.
that
being
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
deferred
to
the
commission's
reasonable
interpretation,
an
interpretation
manifested
in
the
upholding
of
this
transaction.
the
court
of
appeals
also
cited
the
structure
of
section
402
in
reaching
its
conclusion.
it
noted
that
section
402(a)
of
the
act
provides
the
right
of
amtrak
to
seek
trackage
rights,
it
surmised
that
that
was
all
that
amtrak
needed
in
this
case,
and
therefore
it
concluded
that
amtrak
had
to
proceed
under
that
provision
and
not
under
section
402(d).
again,
the
icc,
the
agency
entrusted
with
administration
of
this
statute,
read
the
statute
differently.
it
determined
that
amtrak
had
an
election
of
remedies.
certainly
nothing
in
the
statue
imposes
an
exhaustion
requirement
whereby
amtrak
must
proceed
under
402(a)
before
looking
at
402(d),
in
fact,
quite
the
opposite.
section
402(d)
sets
forth
very
precise
prerequisites--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--(d),
i'm
sorry
if
i--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
the
basic
statute,
402(d),
is
codified
at
45
u.s.c.
562(d).
it
is...
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
page
1a,
sets
forth
402(d).
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
402(d)
sets
forth
the
very
precise
prerequisites
that
amtrak
must
meet
before
invoking
condemnation
authority.
an
exhaustion
of
402(a)
or
any
of
the
other
provisions
in
section
402
is
not
listed
among
the
prerequisites.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
congress
determined
that
amtrak
was
entitled
to
those
powers
on
that
basis.
it
set
forth
a
very
explicit
presumption
in
the
statute.
it
addressed
that
question
when
it
determined
to
give
amtrak
eminent
domain
power,
and
it
said
that
amtrak's
need
for
the
property
shall
be
deemed
to
be
established
unless
both
of
the
contrary
findings
that
you
mentioned
are
made.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
long
as
they
use
it,
so
long
as
they're
unable
to
agree,
and
so
long,
of
course,
as
the
railroad
receives
just
compensation
for
its
property.
that...
amtrak
is
put
in
a
very
disadvantageous
bargaining
position
in
dealing
with
railroads.
this
case
demonstrates
that.
the
boston
and
maine
owned
the
only
line
over
which
amtrak
wanted
to
run
its
montrealer
service
to
serve
the
states
of
vermont
and
new
hampshire.
boston
and
maine
held
all
the
cards.
congress
gave
it
this
broad
eminent
domain
power
precisely
to
address
that
inequity
in
bargaining
position.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
significantly--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
may
well
always
be
sufficient
under
the
statute.
the
significant
impairment
question
goes
to
what's
happening
to
the
railroad
from
whom...
from
which
the
property
is
being
taken,
so
that
wouldn't
be
the
pertinent
inquiry,
but
certainly
amtrak
is
required
by
statute
to
take
steps
to
minimize
federal
subsidies.
it
is
required
by
statute
to
take
steps
to
encourage
private
parties
to
subsidize
inter-city
passenger
rail
service.
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
no,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
reconveyance
from
amtrak
to
the
competitor
also
must
be
approved
by
the
icc
under
section
11343,
and
in
that...
on
that
question
the
commission
looks
at
normal
competitive
concerns:
what
is
reconveyance
from
one
rail
carrier,
amtrak,
to
another
going
to
do
to
competition
in
the
rail
market,
and
if
the
commission
refuses
to
approve
the
reconveyance
the
transaction
cannot
go
forward.
here,
the
commission
expressly
examined
the
reconveyance
and
found
that
competition
would
not
be
diminished
in
the
market,
that
in
fact
boston
and
maine
would
benefit
from
the
improved
tracks.
but
looked
at
solely
from--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
boston
and
maine
retains
trackage
rights
to
serve
its
customers
on
the
line.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
does
need...
it
doesn't
own
the
track
any
more
so
it
needs
trackage
rights
to
serve
customers
it
already
has
on
the
line,
and
it
was
granted
those
trackage
rights
in
this
transaction.
it
gets
to
run
over
vastly
improved
track,
track
that
the
commission
prior
to
this
transaction
found
was
desperately
in
need
of
maintenance.
it
gets
to
use
that
track
now
in
serving
its
customers,
and
it
has
received
just
compensation
for
its
lines.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
language
is
the
railroad
and
amtrak
are
unable
to
agree--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--upon
terms
for
the
sale.
the
commission--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
still
subject
to
challenge.
that's
an
issue.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
commission
found
$2.3
million.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
million.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
and
what
the
commission
expressly
found
in
this
case
was
that
the
parties
were
unable
to
agree.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
there
is,
it
was
satisfied
in
this
case.
i...
what
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
the
commission
found...
i'm
reading
from
page
130a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
the
commission
found
that
amtrak
has
set
forth
a
detailed
history
of
its
dealings
and
negotiations
with
the
boston
and
maine.
amtrak
made
a
valid
offer
to
purchase,
and
in
response
boston
and
maine
said
it
found
no
need
to
pursue
the
very
complex
offer
to
purchase.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
when
i
quoted
the
part
about
a
valid
purchase...
a
valid
offer
to
purchase
the
line.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
context...
as
the
commission
stated,
in
the
context
of
the
long
and
laborious
dealings
between
amtrak
and
boston
and
maine,
the
commission
found
that
the
parties
were
unable
to
agree.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
wasn't
a...
and
this...
that's
true,
and
this
wasn't
a
first
step.
it
was,
as
the
commission
found
the
result,
the
culmination
of
long...
a
long
and
laborious
history.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
requirement
can't
be
that
the
party
offer
a
fair
market
price
for
the
property
objectively
determined,
because
then
there'd
be
no
need
for
the
condemnation
authority
in
the
first
place.
it
doesn't
say,
for
that
matter...
as
the
point
we've
been
discussing,
it
doesn't
say
good
faith
efforts.
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
agree
with
a
rolls
royce
dealer
on
a
price
for
his
car.
if
amtrak
only
has
$500,000
in
the
bank
and
offers
$500,000
and
it's
inadequate,
the
parties
are
unable
to
agree
and
amtrak
can
proceed
through
some
other
route,
and
that's
all
the
statute
requires.
the
commission
made
that
finding
and
affirmed
it
repeatedly.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
wanted--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
wanted
a
different
trackage
arrangement.
they
wanted
amtrak
to
pick
up
the
tab
for
maintenance
of
the
line,
which
amtrak
thought
had
been
agreed
to
under
a
1977
agreement,
and
at
the
same
time,
of
course,
they
were
listing
a
line
for
abandonment,
so
a
trackage
rights
agreement
from
amtrak's
point
of
view
wouldn't
have
been
of
much
use.
amtrak
made
what
the...
what
the
icc
found
to
be
a
valid
offer.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disturb
that
finding.
it
was
rejected.
b&m
didn't
just
say,
come
back
with
a
higher
price,
it
said
we
see
no
reason
to
pursue
this
purchase
offer
because,
as
you've
mentioned,
they
thought
amtrak
should
go
about
this
through
an
entirely
different
route.
amtrak
met
the
plain
statutory
requirements.
the
parties
were
unable
to
agree.
the
property
is
going
to
be
put
to
use...
is
being
put
to
use
today
in
amtrak's
provision
of
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
and
the
commission
rejected
the
two
findings
that
had
to
be
made
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
need.
that
is
an
alternative
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
also
in
error.
the
court
of
appeals
turned
the
statute
on
its
head
when
it
said
the
commission
failed
to
make
adequate
findings
to
support
amtrak's
need.
the
statute
presumes
need.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the...
i
guess
it
was
a
concurring
opinion
by...
yes.
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
calls
for
any
such
findings.
section
402(d)
is
quite
precise
in
what's
required.
findings
of
that
sort
are
not
at
all
called
for
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
first
of
all,
we
only
reach
that
question
if
the
common
carrier...
the
ability
to
discharge
the
common
carrier
obligations
of
the
railroad
are
going
to
be
impaired.
you
need
to
make
both
the
(a)
finding
and
the
(b)
finding
before
rebutting
a
presumption
of
need.
the
commission
here
said
that
boston
and
maine's
abilities
were
not
going
to
be
significantly
impaired,
primarily
because
they
received
trackage
rights
in
return
and
just
compensation.
turning
to
that,
though,
the
commission
reads
that
phrase
as
meaning
property
in
some
other
place.
can
amtrak
serve
its
need
by
alternative
property,
or
interest
in
property...
in
other
words
interest
in
that
alternative
property,
not
the
property
that's
subject
to
the
condemnation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
unable-to-agree
point,
petition
appendix
131a,
the
commission
went
further
and
said
nothing
in
this
record
provides
any
indication
that
amtrak
and
b&m
will
ever
reach
agreement
on
terms
of
a
sale,
and
i
think
that's
because
they
were
proceeding
in
different
directions.
boston
and
maine
wanted
to
talk
about
trackage
rights.
amtrak
wanted
to
talk
about
the
fee.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
amtrak
met
the
statutory
requirement
of
need
because
its
need
was
presumed.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
amtrak
did
need
the
fee.
one
reason
it
needed
the
fee--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
under
a
very
strict
reading
of
the
required
phrase
they
needed
the
fee
because
they
needed
to
have
it
to
reconvey
it
to
a
railroad
that
had
an
incentive
to
maintain
the
track
at
their
speed
conditions.
boston
and
maine
itself
argues--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
there--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
did
make
a
need
finding,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
said
that
amtrak
had
carried
its
burden
of
establishing
its
need.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
the
transaction
that
was
before
the
commission,
and
that
was
the
context
in
which
the
commission
made
that
finding.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
commission--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
commission
did
not
make
the
findings
about
boston
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
did
not,
and
our
position
is
that
it
doesn't
have
to.
nothing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--she
would
have
sent
back
for
further--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
disagree
that
they
made
no
findings
adopting
amtrak's
version
of
events.
i
do
think
that
amtrak's
version
of
events
is
supported
in
the
record,
and
that
supports
the
agency
action,
and
i
also
think
that
nothing
in
section
402(d)
requires
the
commission
to
make
those
sorts
of
findings.
that
would
be
judicially
imposing
an
additional
requirement
in
the
statute
that's
not
found
there.
what
the
statute--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
statute
says
that
need
is
presumed
unless
the
commission
makes
contrary
findings,
and
the
commission
rejected
each
of
the
two
contrary
findings
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
a
two-tier
analysis,
but
required
simply
means
it's
going
to
be
useful
and
appropriate
and
put
to
use
in
providing
intercity
rail
passenger
service.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
it's
satisfied
because
this
property
is
used
in
providing
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
the
montrealer
runs
over
what
used
to
be
the
boston
and
maine
line.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
may
well
be,
but
i'll
reiterate
what
i
said
earlier,
that
there's
nothing
in
section
402(d)
or
(a)
that
imposes
such
an
exhaustion
requirement.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
needed
the
fee
in
part
to
be
able
to
convey
it
to
a
railroad
that
would
maintain
the
line.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
boston
and
maine--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if
they
didn't
have
the
fee
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
engage
in
the
transaction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
boston
and
maine,
as
it
itself
emphasized,
had
no
incentive
to
maintain
these
tracks
in
a
condition
suitable
for
amtrak
service.
that's
their
basic
point.
we
don't...
17
miles
an
hour
is
fine
for
our
trains.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
could
only
have
reasoned
that
if
it
were
imposing
a
requirement
that
you
will
not
find
in
section
402(d).
the
commission
made
each
of
the
findings
in
section
402(d).
they
do
not
require
findings
that
particular
railroad's
not
living
up
to
its
obligations.
that's
not
something
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
need
is
presumed.
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
thank
you,
your
honor.
