justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
take
the
position
that
any
instance
in
which
the
exercise
of
the
eminent
domain
power,
followed
by
a
reconveyance,
would
in
effect
give
amtrak
a
cheaper
way
of
using
a
particular
line,
that
amtrak
therefore
has
met
the
significantly
impair
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
whenever...
well,
let's
say
whenever
one
of
b&m's
competitors
comes
along
and
says
well,
if
you
condemn
it
and
give
it
to
us,
we
will
maintain
the
track
for
you
cheaper
than
you
would
have
to
chip
in
for
the
b&m
to
maintain
it
for
you.
is
that
always
going
to
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
significantly
impair
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
mean,
then,
that
whenever
a
competitor
of
the
condemnee
would
make
a
favorable
agreement
with
amtrak
to
maintain
the
line
at
a
cheaper
maintenance
or
operating
cost
that
it
will
always
be
lawful
under
the
statute
for
amtrak
to...
or
for
the
commission
to
allow
amtrak
to
condemn?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
boston
and
maine
going
to
benefit
having
its
competitor
on
this
line
have
an
upgraded
track
in
part
with
the
subsidy
of
the
federal
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
need
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
need
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
won't
it
always
require
less
than
a
fee
when
it's
trackage
rights?
i
mean,
the
only
thing
it
needs
is
the
right
to
go
over
track,
so
when
we're
talking
about
trackage
won't
the
result
of
your
analysis
always
be
that
something
less
than
a
fee
will
suffice?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
assuming
that
they're
taking
it
from
another
railroad.
justice
david
h.
souter
when,
for
the...
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
they
would
need
to
take
the
fee
in
trackage
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
that
goes
to
that
point?
you
mentioned
earlier
that
under
subsection
(d)
there
might
be
a
need
to
condemn
together
with
an
easement
allowing
amtrak
to
come
in
and
do
its
own
maintenance.
given
the
fact
that
under
(a)
the
commission
can
always
require
amtrak
to
pay
the
incremental
cost
of
maintenance
to
get
it
up
to
amtrak's
standard,
there
never
would
be
a
possible
showing
of
need
under
(d),
would
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
identifying
what
is
required
with
presumed
need.
you're
saying
there
is
not
a
two-tier
analysis,
there's
a
one-tier
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
would
satisfy
that
level
of
analysis
at
this
point
simply
because
the
ultimate
expense
to
amtrak
of
maintaining
the
track
would
be
less
under
this
arrangement.
that's
the
way
you
satisfy
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
well,
again,
i
guess
your
argument
again
assumes
that
you
have
an
absolute
election
as
to
whether
to
proceed
under
subsection
(a)
or
subsection
(d).
if
you
don't
make
that
assumption,
then
your
first-tier
analysis
of
what
is
required
depends
upon
assuming
that
a
lower
maintenance
cost
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
standard
requirement.
