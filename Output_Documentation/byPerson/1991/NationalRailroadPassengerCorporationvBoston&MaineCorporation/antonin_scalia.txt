justice
antonin
scalia
challenge
you
to
come
up
with
an
explanation
as
to
how
this
amendment
goes
to
the
word
required,
which
is
the
basis
for
the
decision
below.
i
think
it's
a
dead
stand-off
on
that
one.
neither
one
of
you
can
explain
the
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
on
the
basis
of
the
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
amendment
has
to
be
understood
primarily
on
the
basis
of
its
language,
and
nothing
in
its
language
whatever
goes
to
the
word
required,
which
was
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
reconveyance
is
only
one
manner
of
proving
that
you
don't
need
the
property.
the
principle
at
issue,
the
principle
that
underlay
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
was
that
amtrak
did
not
need
the
property.
nothing
in
the
amendment
goes
to
whether
you
have
to
show
a
requirement
for
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
we'd
have
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
say,
you
should
not
consider
the
reconveyance
automatically
to
show
that
they
didn't
need
the
property,
but
you
can
still
consider
whether
they
needed
the
property
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
waste
all
that
time,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
will
only
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
i...
of
course
required
can
be
read
the
way
the
commission
wanted
to,
in
isolation,
but
isn't
it
unreasonable
to
read
it
that
way
when,
if
you
do
not
read
it
to
impose
a
requirement
of
necessity
in
the
narrow
sense,
the
only
thing
amtrak
has
to
do
in
order
to
condemn
property
is
to
show
either...
either...
that
taking
it
away
will
not
impair
the
ability
of
the
railroad
it's
taking
it
from
to
function,
or
that
it
can't
do
without
the
property
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
think
they
gave
amtrak
the
power
to
take
any
property
from
any
railroad
in
the
country,
so
long
as
taking
that
property
didn't
impair
the
ability
of
that
railroad
to
operate.
that's
how
you're
reading
it...
so
long
as
they
using
it...
use
it
for
the
railroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
such
a
good
deal
for
them,
you'd
think
they
would
have
entered
into
that
deal
with
amtrak.
and
that
leads
me
to
a
question,
doesn't
the
statute
require
that
the
condemnation
can
only
occur
if
negotiations
have
failed?
what
is
the
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
unable
to
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you
think
that
means
nothing
more...
what
was
the
actual
condemnation
price
here,
$2.5
million?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
or
take
a
little--
justice
antonin
scalia
--$2.3
million,
and
amtrak
came
in,
and
how
much
did
amtrak
offer?
justice
antonin
scalia
amtrak
offered
a
million
and
said
gee,
we
can't
agree,
you
won't
take
a
million.
is
that
all
the
statute
means?
you
come
in
and
pick
a
ridiculously
low
number,
offer
it
to
the
other
side
and
say,
well,
we
can't
agree,
and
then
i
can
condemn
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
i
don't
deny
that.
they
weren't
able
to
agree
in
that
sense,
but
is
that
really
what
the...
don't
you
there's
a
good-faith
negotiation
requirement
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
a
finding
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
waiting
for
your
good-faith
effort.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sure
it
was
a
valid
offer
to
purchase.
it
was
a
valid
offer
to
purchase.
if
they'd
accepted
it
at
$1
million,
it
would
have
been
accepted
and
that
would
have
been
a
contract.
that's
a
valid
offer
to
purchase.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
long
and
laborious
dealings
about
other
matters,
but
this
was
the
only
dealing
about
a
purchase.
amtrak
came
in
and
said,
give
me...
i'll
give
you
$1
million,
and
they
said
don't
be
silly,
that's
ridiculous,
which
of
course
it
was.
well,
any
condemning
authority
is
always
going
to
offer
a
good
deal
less
than
they
think
the
property
is
worth
as
a
first
step
of
the
negotiation.
justice
antonin
scalia
every
negotiating
authority
doesn't
have
a
provision
like
this
that
says,
if
the
parties
are
unable
to
agree.
i
mean,
other
people
can
just
walk
in
and
say,
we're
condemning
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
rather
silly
requirement
if
that's
all
it
means.
absolutely
pointless.
well,
isn't
it
also
relevant...
maybe
i
don't
have
the
facts
well
in
mind,
but
didn't
b&m
respond
by
saying
in
effect
we're
not
willing
to
sell
but
what
we'd
like
to
do
is
negotiate
a
different
trackage
arrangement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
they
thought
that
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you're
disagreeing
with
the
government
on
that
point.
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
you
have
to
go
through
two
inquiries
as
well.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
government
thinks
that
required...
the
first
inquiry,
the
required
inquiry,
is
just,
you
know,
are
you
going
to
use
it
for
your
rail
service,
whereas
you
say
it
means
it's
essential
for
your
rail
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldbloom,
it
occurs
to
me...
i'm
not
sure
you're
making
thomas
jefferson's
argument.
i
think
you
may
be
using
required
in
the
same
sense
that
marshall
used
necessary.
i
wonder
why
you
don't
place
more
stress
on
the
parenthetical
in
subsection
(d)
of
562.
it
reads:
upon
terms
for
the
sale
to
the
corporation
of
property,
parenthesis,
including
interests
in
property
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
it
goes
out
of
its
way
to
put
in
the
parenthetical
including
interests
in
property.
and
the
general
condemnation
section...
section,
what
is
it,
545...
doesn't...
never
includes
any
such
parenthetical.
it
says
the
corporation
is
authorized
to
acquire
any
property,
and
it
doesn't
say,
parenthesis,
including
interests
in
property,
which
the
secretary
acting
in
further
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
why
don't
you
place
more
stress
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
required
modifies
the
interest
in
property,
and
the
interest
in
property
has
to
be
used
by
the
corporation...
not
necessary
to
the
corporation,
but
used,
and
you're
saying
it's
not
being
used
here,
the
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldbloom,
you
make
briefly
in
your
brief
the
unable
to
agree
argument,
but
you
don't
go
into
much
detail
on
it.
do
you
think
these
negotiations
were...
as
the
government
said,
went
as
far
as
they
could
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
more
should
have
been
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
your
client
willing
to
sell
at
any
price?
