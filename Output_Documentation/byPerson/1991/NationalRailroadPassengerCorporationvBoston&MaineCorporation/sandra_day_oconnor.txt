mr.
roberts,
does
the
icc
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
property
is
required
for
inner-city
rail
passenger
service?
they
have
to
look
at
that
question
and
decide
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
icc
have
to
decide
whether
a
less
than
a
fee
interest
would
meet
the
so-called
requirement,
or
that
what
is
required
is
less
than
a
fee
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
fee
or
nothing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
who
decides
whether
an
easement
will
suffice
as
opposed
to
taking
the
fee
interest
in
the
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--now,
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
remanded
for
a
determination
of
the
extent
to
which
the
full
fee
was
needed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
note
that
it
does
say
the
commission
has
to
find
the
obligations
can
adequately
be
met
by
the
acquisition
of
alternative
property,
including
the
interest
in
property.
maybe
it
has
to
determine
what
interest
in
this
property
was
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
goldbloom,
i
thought
the
problem
here
was
that
the
amtrak
could
get
a
trackage
right
but
it
needed
a
trackage
right
over
a
rail
line
that
was
maintained
adequately
to
enable
it
to
run
its
passenger
trains
at
the
appropriate
speed,
and
that
what
it
would
get
here
with
a
trackage
right
was
simply
a
right
to
run
its
railroads
over
very
poorly
maintained
rails
at
speeds
that
wouldn't
meet
its
need.
so
it
needed
something
that
was
going
to
be
maintained
at
a
higher
level
than
b&m
would
maintain
it,
and
boston
and
maine
had
made
a
determination
that
for
its
purposes
it
didn't
need
to
maintain
the
tracks
at
this
higher
level
degree
of
maintenance.
now,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
an
order
under
(a)
it
would
be...
the
commission
would
have
to
order
amtrak
to
pay
the
costs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
amtrak
doesn't
have
the
money
and
has
found
a
mechanism
whereby
it
can
get
a
third
party
to
provide
that
cost,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
determining
what
is
required
can
the
icc
look
at
the
cost
to
amtrak
as
part
of
that
determination?
i
mean,
amtrak
would
assert,
i
require
the
use
of
the
tracks
at
a
reasonable
cost,
or
at
a
cost
that
we
can
afford
to
pay.
