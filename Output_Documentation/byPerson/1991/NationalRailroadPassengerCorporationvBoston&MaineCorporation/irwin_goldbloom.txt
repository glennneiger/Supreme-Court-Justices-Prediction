mr.
irwin
goldbloom
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
a
condemnation
statute
which
allows
the
taking
of
private
property.
simply
stated,
our
position
is
that
section
402(d),
the
statute
that's
implicated
directly
in
this
case,
cannot
be
used
by
amtrak
to
condemn
more
property
than
is
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
in
this
case,
the
commission
failed
to
make
a
relevant
inquiry
into
what
property
was
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
it
erroneously
assumed
that
whatever
amtrak
wanted
it
was
entitled
to
take
and
proceeded
with
a
case
in
which
it
ultimately
approved
the
conveyance.
in
our
view,
that's
an
erroneous
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
yes,
chief
justice,
it
does
say
that,
but
that
is
a
second
level
of
inquiry
that
the
commission
must
make.
the
predicate
for
the
invocation
of
the
statute
appears
right
out
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute,
and
in
this
particular
statute
we
have
a
series
of
limitations
written
into
the
statute
which
provide
in
the
first
instance
that
the
parties
are
unable
to
agree.
there
is
a
definition
in
the
statute
that
the
property
that
is...
that
is
being
sought
is
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
and
there's
a
third
limitation
because
there's
a
description
of
the
term
property
with
a
parenthetical
including
interests
in
property.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
yes,
chief
justice,
that
is
our
answer,
and
let
me
amplify,
if
i
may,
on
that.
when
congress
enacted
this
particular
section
in
1973
they
also
enacted
a
similar
provision,
section
305(d)
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act,
which
provides
amtrak
with
the
authority
to
condemn
nonrailroad-owned
property...
that
is,
property
that
might
be
owned
by
any
other
private
party.
and
that
statutory
provision
has
a
similar
language
in
it,
which
says
that
the
property,
again,
must
be
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
now,
the
reason
why
the
requirement
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service
has
to
be
met
in
the
first
instance
is
that
the
second
level
of
determination
of
need
applies
only
if
it
will
substantially
impair
the
obligations
of
the...
of
the
railroad
to
function
as
a
common
carrier.
now,
let
us
assume
as
a
hypothetical
that
conrail
owes...
owns
a
building
over
here
on
pennsylvania
avenue.
that
building
could
conceivably
be
taken
by
amtrak
for
whatever
purposes
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
taking
of
the
building
doesn't
impair
conrail's
ability
to
act
as
a
common
carrier.
if
you
don't
go
through
the
first
level
of
limitation
that
is
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
you
never
get
to
the
consideration
of
why
they're
taking
the
property
in
the
first
instance,
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
nature
of
this
very
type
of
statute.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
i
don't
believe
it
goes
as
far
as
the
word
essential.
i
think
the
word
required
has
a
meaning
which
has
context
in
the
statute.
let
me
deal
with
the
government's
argument
first.
they
say
required
means
useful,
appropriate;
amtrak,
the
petitioner,
says
in
connection
with,
but
the
statute
has
a
language...
congress
used
a
very
stringent
verb
in
connection
with
this
particular
statute,
and
that
verb
required
informs
a
court,
or
the
commission,
how
amtrak
intends
to
be
using
the
property
that
it
intends
to
take.
now,
it
is
not
a
question
that
it
is
absolutely
essential
or
indispensable.
the
question
is
required,
and
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
where
congress
speaks
in
terms
of
property,
including
interests
in
property,
there
is
a
whole
history
of
statutory
construction
of
the
concept
of
eminent
domain
in
private
hands,
that
the
least
interest
that
is
intrusive
should
be
taken
in
the
circumstances
of
an
eminent
domain
statute.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
no,
we're
not
arguing...
justice
stevens,
we're
not
arguing
that
they
did
not
require
the
use
of
this
trackage.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
they
didn't
need
the
fee.
and
to
take
that
a
step
further,
when
the
commission
is
confronted
with
an
application
under
section
402(d)
it
should
look
to
see
what
is
it
that
amtrak
requires,
and
if
they
can
determine
that
amtrak
requires
something
less
than
a
fee,
then
that
is
what
amtrak
should
be
entitled
to
get.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
no,
justice
souter.
there
may
be
circumstances
where
what
they
require
is
property,
and
property--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--it
may
be
property.
it
may
be
just
real
estate,
taking
it
from
another
railroad.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
i
cannot...
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
judge
ginsburg
in
the
court
below
that
in
a
circumstance
where
amtrak
was
dealing
with
another
railroad
and
where,
under
the
facts
in
that
particular
hypothetical,
amtrak
was
unable
to
get
the
type
of
trackage
rights
interest
or
the
cooperation
of
the
other
railroad
in
running
its
trains
over
those
tracks,
in
those
circumstances,
judge
ginsburg
suggests
that
perhaps
402(a)
could
be
used
to
obtain
trackage
rights.
but
then
she
goes
on
to
say,
this
case
doesn't
establish
that,
and
on
the
facts
in
this
case
it
is
clear
that
something
less
than
the
fee
would
be
what
amtrak
should
be
entitled
to
get.
and
if
i
may
amplify
further,
section
402(a)
has
a
provision
for
granting
trackage
rights
to
amtrak
when
they
are
unable
to
agree
with
a
railroad
over
the
use
of
the
tracks,
and
in
those
circumstances
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
impose
a
trackage
rights
agreement
on
a
railroad
and
to
impose
conditions
for
not
only
trackage
rights,
the
furnishing
of
services
and
facilities.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
well,
justice
o'connor,
under
402(a)
the
commission
can
impose
conditions
upon
the
railroad
in
providing
the
trackage
rights.
it
can...
it
could
require
boston
and
maine
to
upgrade
the
tracks
and
to
maintain
them,
and
in
so
doing
it
would
look
to
the
provisions
that
congress
imposed
in
402(a),
which
requires
that
there
be
no
cross-subsidization
by
the
freight
railroad
of
the
rail
passenger
service,
and
the
incremental
costs
for
the
quality
and
nature
of
the
service
being
provided
to
amtrak
are
to
be
provided...
are
to
be
paid
for
by
amtrak,
and
that's
what
was
at
the
core
problem
of
the
controversy
between
amtrak--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--that's
because
the
statute
requires
that.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
by
brokering
its
condemnation
authority
to
a
third
railroad,
and
in
so
doing
it
has
gotten
around
the
provisions
of
402(a)
which
expresses
the
congressional
policy
to
prevent
cross-subsidization,
to
require
that
amtrak
bear
the
incremental
costs
of
the
rail
passenger
services.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
well,
i
do
place
stress
on
it,
because
i
believe
the
reference
to
including
interests
in
property
is
a
congressional
recognition
that
something
less
than
the
fee
might
be
called
for
when
amtrak
seeks
to
condemn--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--it's
not
being
used
because,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
as
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case,
amtrak
did
not
want
to
own
the
property,
did
not
need
to
own
the
property,
and
had
no
interest
in
owning
it,
ever,
and
so
if
it
was
capable
of
being
satisfied
by
an
interest
in
property
less
than
the
fee,
then
the
fee
by
definition
could
not
be
required.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
what
i'm
saying,
justice
stevens,
is
that
when
the
commission
is
confronted
with
an
application
under
402(d)
it
should
examine
to
see
what
it
is
that
amtrak
is
required...
amtrak
requires.
if
it
looks
at
what
amtrak
requires
and
sees
that
what
it
really
needs
is
a
trackage
rights
agreement
with
imposition
of
conditions
and
maintenance
requirements,
then
it
should
say
to
amtrak
your
proper
relief
and
remedy
is
a
petition
under
402(a).
that's
what
you
should
do.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
it
determines
that
a
trackage
rights
agreement
will
not
suffice,
but
something
more,
let's
say...
and
it's
been
suggested
in
this
record
by
one
of
the
vice
chairmen
of
the
commission...
that
perhaps
an
easement
to
go
onto
the
tracks
and
to
perform
maintenance
services
of
that
character,
then
perhaps
trackage
rights
agreements
and
an
easement
might
be
sufficient
to
fulfill
amtrak's
requirements.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
yes,
justice
stevens--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--because
we
don't
believe
the
statute
as
amended
affects
the
result
in
this
case.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
that
may
very
well
be,
and
we've
suggested
that
there
might
be
circumstances
where
it
might
be
necessary
under...
under
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
to
take
a
larger
interest
than
amtrak
actually
needs,
such
as
a...
take
a
large
building
and
to
raze
it
and
put
up
a
small
structure.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
of
appeals
had
more
than
one
finding.
there
is
a
finding...
there
is
a
conclusion
or
a
holding
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
says
that
amtrak
may
not
take
property
that
it
does
not
itself
intend
to
own,
and
as
to
that
holding,
the
court
of
appeals...
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
has
been
overruled
by
the
1990
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
and
had
other
holdings.
it
said
that
when
the
commission
is
faced
with
a
402(d)
application
it
must
make
a
determination
as
to
what
is
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service.
it
found...
and
this
is
a
unanimous
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
judge
ginsburg
also
agreed
with
this...
that
the
commission
had
not
made
that
determination...
what
is
required.
and
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
they
admit,
or
concede
that
the
commission
did
not
make
a
determination
as
to
what
is
required.
they
say
that
some
kind
of
an
abstract,
perhaps,
decision
was
made.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
came
up
this
way.
at
the
very
outset
of
the
proceedings,
early
on,
right
after
amtrak
filed
its
petition,
boston
and
maine
came
in
with
a
petition
to
convert
the
402(d)
proceeding
to
a
402(a)
proceeding,
and
it
said
to
the
commission
this
is
really
a
dispute
between
us
over
the
upgrading
and
the
maintenance
of
these
tracks,
and
we're
having
a
fight
over
who
is
supposed
to
pay
for
this,
and
we
think
that
amtrak
should
pay
for
it
because
after
all
it's
one
train
that
goes
back
and
forth
once
a
day
and
it's
going
to
cost
$400,000
a
year
or
so,
and
it
should
be
amtrak's
responsibility.
nevertheless,
we're
willing
to
put
this
before
the
commission
and
have
the
commission
decide
who
is
to
pay
for
the
upgrading
and
maintenance
of
this
tracks.
the
commission...
and
they
did
this
before
holding
any
kind
of
an
evidentiary
proceeding,
before
looking
at
any
evidence,
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
filings
that
the...
that
amtrak
had
made
and
that
boston
and
maine
had
made,
said
we
reject
this
petition
to
convert.
amtrak
has
an
election
of
remedies.
it
has
asked
for
relief
under
402(d).
that's
all
we
need
to
look
into.
they're
entitled
to
a
conveyance
if
they
have...
if
they
made
that
application,
and
then
we're
going
to
go
on
with
our
proceeding.
now,
they
did
so
without
an
evidentiary
proceeding,
and
they
were
applying,
in
a
sense,
the
same
statutory
phrase
that
any
federal
district
judge
would
have
to
apply
faced
with
an
attempted
taking
by
amtrak
of
nonrailroad
property,
and
they
did
it
almost...
to
draw
an
analogy,
if
there
was
a
complaint
and
an
answer
and
a
district
judge
looked
at
the
complaint
and
answer
and
made
a
determination
without
doing
anything
further.
and
in
this
case
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding
under
the
required
phrase
of
the
statute.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that.
they
also
said
that
the
commission's
ruling
did
violence
to
the
provisions
of
402(a),
because
they
overlooked
the
requirements
of
402(a)
that
require
amtrak
to
pay
the
incremental
costs
of
rail
passenger
service,
and
by
allowing
amtrak
to
evade
those
requirements
the
commission
failed
to
adhere
to
the
statutory
requirements.
now--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
hard
case
to
make.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
couldn't
be
made
under
any
circumstance,
but
it
would
be
a
hard
case
to
make,
particularly
since
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
impose
these
requirements
on
freight
railroads,
to
allow
amtrak
to
use
their
tracks
and
to
provide
services
and
facilities.
and
so
armed
with
the
authority
of
the
commission
amtrak
can
clearly
go
to
a
railroad
and
say
this
is
what
we
want
and
this
is
what
we
need
when
it
comes
to
providing
services
for
us.
and
since
congress
has
set
out
a
very
particularized
scheme
under
which
amtrak
is
entitled
to
get
those
services,
facilities,
and
use
of
tracks,
we
don't
think
that
the
use
of
a
condemnation
power,
which
traditionally
has
been
construed
by
the
courts,
particularly
in
the
hands
of
a
private
party,
as
being
limited,
restricted,
narrowly
construed,
to
give
amtrak
the
right
to
use
it
to
the
extent
that
they've
seen
fit
to
use
it
here.
the
statutory
scheme
is
such
that
congress
very
clearly
imposed
limitations
on
the
authority
of
amtrak
to
obtain
property.
now,
the
government
makes
a
further
argument.
they
say
that
chevron
controls
the
determination
of
the
commission,
but
for
a
number
of
reasons
chevron
is
not
applicable.
to
begin
with,
the
statute
is
not
really
ambiguous.
chevron
applies
where
you
have
to
grope
and
figure
out
what
the
statute
really
means.
the
statute
has
plain
language.
it's
to
be
construed
by
the
commission
under
some
circumstances
by
a
whole
host
of
federal
district
judges,
under
other...
where
the
property
is
being
sought
to
be
taken
from
private
parties
that
are
not
railroads.
certainly
the
chevron
decision
wouldn't
apply
to
the
rulings
of
600
or
so
federal
district
judges.
but
there
are
limitations
in
this
statute,
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
chevron
case
applies
where
there
are
limitations.
in
this
particular
setting,
the
commission
has
construed
away
the
limitations
that
are
in
the
statute.
it
never
really
applied
them,
and
therefore
we
can't
see
how
chevron
would
be
applicable.
and
thirdly
we
don't
believe
it's
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute
because,
as
i've
indicated,
there
are
circumstances
where,
using
the
commission's
construction,
amtrak
could
take
an
office
building,
a
property
of...
that
is
owned
by
another
railroad,
without
ever
showing
that
that
property
is
required
for
intercity
rail
passenger
service,
and
the
only
mean...
the
only
restriction
would
be
whether
the
taking
of
that
property
impaired
the
functions
of
the
condemnee's
ability
to
perform
as
a
common
carrier.
and
finally,
we
don't
think
that
chevron
applies
because
there
just
simply
is
a
nonfinding
here.
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding,
as
we
read
the
government's
brief
at
page
16.
they
concede
that
the
commission
did
not
and
does
not
need
to
make
a
determination
of
what
the
lesser
interests
that
are
required
in
the
circumstances
of
amtrak's
petition
for
the
taking
in
this
case.
so
where
the
commission
does
not
make
a
finding
we
don't
see
how
chevron
can
have
any
application.
this
case--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--the
precise
statutory
language
appears
as...
in
the
opening
sentence
of
section
402(d).
it
says:
if
the
corporation
and
a
railroad
are
unable
to
agree
upon
terms
for
the
sale
to
the
corporation
of
property,
paren,
including
interests
in
property
owned
by
the
railroad
and
required
for
inter-city
rail
passenger
service,
the
corporation
may
apply
to
the
commission.
we
view
those
phrases
at
the
beginning
of
this
statutory
provision
as
being
statutory
predicates
to
the
invocation
of
the
taking
power.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
unable
to
agree--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--is
one.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
yes,
your...
yes,
chief
justice.
and
a
third
limitation,
although
it's
not
written
in
as
a
finding
but
it's
certainly
clearly
implicated
in
the
statute
is,
that
it
be
property,
including
interests
in
the
property,
which
is
a
clear
recognition
by
congress
that
perhaps
in
these
circumstances
something
less
than
the
fee
would
suffice.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
well,
of
property...
i
read
property
as
being
the
fee.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
yes.
this
is
what
they're
seeking
to
condemn.
the...
this
is
the
subject
of
the
condemnation.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
that
is
no...
we
do
not
dispute
that.
the
question
is,
who's
going
to
pay
for
it,
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
test.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
there
were
negotiations
with...
between
amtrak
and
boston
and
maine--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--they
were
unsuccessful,
and
they
were
always
about
who
was
going
to
pay
for
the
maintenance
and
the
upgrading
of
the
tracks,
and
when
amtrak
made
its
$1
million
take-it-or-leave-it
offer,
it
did
so
on
the
assumption
that
amtrak...
that
boston
and
maine
was
not
going
to
accept
it,
and
as
soon
as
it
received
whatever
response
it
got,
and
the
response
was,
we're
ready
to
negotiate,
we're
talking
about
good-faith
negotiations
about
the
problem
that
we
have
with
the
upgrading
and
maintenance
of
these
tracks,
they
treated
it
as
a
rejection
and
they
filed
with
the
commission.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
they--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--yes.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
it's
going
to
go
back
to
the
commission,
but
if
the
commission
properly
construes
the
statute
it
will
see
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
amtrak
does
not
require
the
fee--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--well,
if
they're
properly
applying
the
statute,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
as
we
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm,
the
commission
should
look
to
see
what
it
is
that
amtrak
requires,
and
if
amtrak
requires
really
nothing
more
than
a
trackage
rights
agreement,
which
incidentally
is
all
that
it
ultimately
got
after
the
conveyance
to
central
vermont,
then
that's
what
the
commission
should
impose
upon
boston
and
maine.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
the
underlying
basis
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act
was
to
make
amtrak
pay
its
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
rail
passenger
service
and
not
have
the
freight
railroads
subsidize
this
operation.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
because
it
ends
up
by
taking
property...
and
this
comes
to
our
third
argument.
it
ends
up
by
taking
property
from
a
and
giving
it
to
b
with
no
real
change
in
the
public
use.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
but
that
has
just
simply...
the
simple
payment
of
just
compensation
without
a
corresponding
change
in
public
use
has
never
been
considered
to
meet
the
public
use
test
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
no,
your--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--what
happened
with
the
negotiations
were
that
they
weren't
going
in
the
same
direction,
because
a
take-it-or-leave-it
offer
of
a
ridiculously
low
price
is
not
a
fair
proposal.
boston
and
maine--
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
--our
client
offered...
our
client
discussed
the
possibility...
and
this
is
disclosed
in
the
record...
of
selling
the
connecticut
river
line
to
amtrak.
if
it
did
so
for
a
fair
price
and
under
the
proper
circumstances
it
would
continue
to
have
the
same
kind
of
rights
that
it
has
to
deal
with
its
shippers
and
its
customers.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
it
was
long
before
that.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
in
their
responsive
letter
they
did
not.
mr.
irwin
goldbloom
they
suggested
negotiating.
