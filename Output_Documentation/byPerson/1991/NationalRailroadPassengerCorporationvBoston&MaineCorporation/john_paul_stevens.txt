john
paul

let
me
just
interrupt,
because
i
think
i'm
following
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
right.
is
the
gist
of
your
argument
that
the
fee
interest
wasn't
required
since
a
leasehold
or
an
easement
was
sufficient,
or
are
you
also
arguing
that
they
did
not
require
the
use
of
this
particular
trackage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you're
arguing
they
didn't
need
a
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that...
you're
making
two
different
arguments,
one,
you're
arguing
they
should
have
proceeded
under
402(a)
to
require
trackage
rights.
now
you're
saying
they
should
have
proceeded
under
402(d)(1)
to
condemn
trackage
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
you
could
logically
make
the
same
argument
in
the
face
of
the
statute
as
now
amended?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
statute
as
amended
assumes
that
there
would
be
situations
in
which
the
condemnation
would
require
a
greater
property
interest
than
the
commission
absolutely
needs
because
it
can
reconvey
the
property
and
obviously
take
back
something
less
than
the
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
read
the
word
property
in
the
third
line
there
as
property
interest,
for
sale
to
the
corporation
of
the
particular
property
interest
owned
by
the
railroad
and
required
for
interstate...
that's
the
way
you
read
it.
i
mean,
it's
certainly
a
permissible
reading,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
it
make
that
discussion
about
sale
before
or
after
the
$1
million
offer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
after
that,
in
their
responsive
letter,
they
didn't
discuss
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
suggested
negotiating
a
trackage--
