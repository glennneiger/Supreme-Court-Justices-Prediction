justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't
say,
though--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
if
a...
if
a
court
has
ordered
the
bar
to
stay
within
constitutional
bounds
right
across
the
board,
that
a...
that
a
bar
association
that
claims
it's
living
up
to
the
law
could
predict
in
advance
that
it's
not
going
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
could...
how
could
you
expect
a
bar
to
remit
something
in
advance
that
it
has
no
intention
of
owing
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you...
but
i
would
think
you...
you
claim
that
there
should
be
a
reduction
in
advance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you...
but
you
can't...
even
if
the...
if
the
bar
says
we're
not
going
to
engage
in
any
of
the
things
that
would...
would
make
us
refund
part
of
your
dues,
how
can--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
can
you
ask
them
to
then
estimate
how
much
they're
going
to
break
the
law
in
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
your
dispute
would
be...
you
would
say,
you
pick
out
some
items
on
the
legislative
program
and
you
say,
well,
this
is
not
germane.
this
is
not
one
of
those...
this
is
not
obeying
the
law.
this
is
something
outside
of
their
permissible
activities,
and
then
you
want
to...
and
then
you
want
a
hearing
on
that,
and
you...
and
once
you
make
that
objection,
i
suppose
you
want,
then,
an
escrow?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
but
you
want
it
in...
you
want
it
before
they
ever
engage
in
the
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you...
you
think
that...
you
think
the...
the
bar
association
should
escrow
anything
you
object
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but...
they're...
they
claim
that
everything
is
chargeable.
the
bar,
as
justice
stevens
says,
as
the
bar
says,
everything
is
chargeable
to
you,
and
then
it's
up
to
you
to
object
if
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
what
the
florida
court
ordered
in...
in
the
frankel
case
is
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
to
the
extent
that
it
ordered
the
bar
not
to
lobby
on
things
outside
these
certain
core
subjects?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
it
doesn't
require
it,
but
is...
is
this
injunction
that
the
court
issued,
is
limiting
the
things
the
bar
could
lobby
on...
lobby
about,
is
that
injunction
consistent
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
here...
here
the
supreme
court
of
florida
ordered
them
to
limit
their
lobbying
to
certain
subjects.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
would
be
consistent
with--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
don't...
so
you
are
really...
your
answer
here
is...
you
are
including
in
your...
the
frankel
decision
in
your
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
not
going
to...
under
the
frankel
decision
as
you
construe
it,
you're
not
going
to
escrow
anything
until
somebody
objects.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this...
i
know
that
you
think
the
frankel
decision
really
means
to
you
that
you
should
stay
within
this...
these
germane
areas
in
all
of
your
activities,
whether
it's
lobbying
or
publications.
you
include
all
of
your...
all
of
your
educational
materials,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
how
do
we...
that's
what
you
say
you're
going
to
do,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
injunction
that
the
court
issued
against
the
bar
was
limited
to
those
lobbying
positions
6(a)
through
6(h).
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
the
only
obligation
that
the
bar
must--
justice
byron
r.
white
--must
observe.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
technically...
technically
you
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
supreme
court
order
if
you...
if
you
lobbied
on
nongermane
things
that
just
didn't
happen
to
be
6(a)
through
6(h).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
say
you're
not
going
to
do
that.
we
don't
know
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
know
that...
you
know
that
in
the
past
you
have
engaged
in
nongermane
lobbying.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
activities,
because
as
frankel
well
illustrates,
and
are
we
supposed
to
just
believe
that
your...
that
the
bar
is
going
to
refrain
from
nongermane
activities
that
don't
happen
to
be
within
6(a)
through
6(h)?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't.
if...
if
the
bar
happened
to
say...
say
well,
we're
going
to
take
these
nongermane
positions
in
lobbying
which
are
not
within
6(a)
through
6(h)...
we
know
that
we're
going
to
do
that...
and
you
budget
something
for
those
activities,
don't
you
think
you
then
would
have
to
escrow
that
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
i
suppose
if
you
knew
in
advance
and
you
thought
that
you
were
going
to
spend
his
money
for
nongermane
activities
that
were
not
forbidden
to
you,
you
ought
to
give
him
his
money
back
right
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
escrow
if
you
concede
yourself
that
this
is
nongermane.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
to
have
an
objection.
you
wouldn't
know
who
to
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
or...
or
if
he
objects
and
you
say
well,
yes,
this
is
a
nongermane
activity,
you're
going
to
give
him
his
money
back
right
then,
i
suppose?
you're
not
going
to
just
escrow
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
right?
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
should,
but
you
wouldn't?
