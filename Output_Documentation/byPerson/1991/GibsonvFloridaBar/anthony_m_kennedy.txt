justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
context
of
the
case
has
very
much
changed
in...
well,
i'll
ask
you,
in
light
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
order
that
the
state
bar
not
engage
in
nonbar-related
activities.
hasn't
that
certainly
changed
the
significance
and
importance
of
this
case,
if
not...
if
not
technically
mooted
it?

--but
in
hudson,
it
was
the
premise
of
the
case
that
the
union
was
going
to
expend
chargeable
and
nonchargeable
amounts.
that
is
not
the
premise
of
this
case,
based
on
the
questions
that
we've
been
asking
you
so
far.
assume,
for
the
moment,
that
we
read
the
frankel
opinion
as
saying
that
the
bar
may
not
engage
in
any
activity
which
causes
a
nonchargeable
expense.
assume
it
says
that.
if
that
is
the
order
of
the
supreme
court,
what
is
the
necessity
for
any
sort
of
advance
budget
or
escrow
provision?
