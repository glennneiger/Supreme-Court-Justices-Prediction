justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
big
difference
in
the
union
cases,
because
there
was
no
prohibition
against
engaging
in
the
activity.
the
only
prohibition
was
against
having
the
members
support
those
activities,
and
here
you've
got
a
prohibition
against--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
supposing
they
send
a
notice
out
to
the
membership,
we...
our
legislative
program
for
1992
contains
the
following
10
items,
and
we
think
they're
all
permissible
under
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision,
there's
no
reason
why
everybody
shouldn't
contribute,
and...
period.
how
are
you
hurt
by
that
notice,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
happens
under
the
new...
new
regime
in
florida.
if
they...
if
they
publicize
their
legislative
program,
what
else
are
they
supposed
to
do
under
your
view
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
send
out
a
dues
request,
send
in
your
$
100,
or
whatever
it
is,
and
by
the
way
here's
our
legislative
program.
they
just
send
that
out,
period.
what
more
should
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
but
they
don't
raise
chargeable
expenses.
i
mean,
there
are
no
nonchargeable
expenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
why
it
says
they
are
going
to
presume
they're
going
to
try
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
suggested
hypothesis--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
finish
my
question,
please.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
justice
stevens
finish
his
question--
--i'm
trying
to
have
a
little
dialogue
here.
--before
you
try
to
answer.
my
question
is,
assume
a
notice
which
tells
the
membership
of
the
bar
what
the
legislative
program
is,
and
it
says,
we
do
not...
we
think
all
of
these
are
consistent
with
the
florida
supreme
court
decision
in
these
supplemental
briefs.
what
more
need
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
weren't
they
going
to
give
you
back
your
money
for
that
activity?
i
would
assume
that
if
it
is
now,
as
i
guess
it
has
been
by
the
frankel
decision,
determined
that
a
lot
of
that
activity
was
unauthorized,
i
presume
that
you'd
have
kind
of
an
automatic
right
to
get
you
money
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
the
decisions
in
this
case,
but
just
that
under
bar
procedure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
factual
question?
does
the
record
tell
us
what
percentage
of
the
total
dues
is
in
dispute
in
this?
i
mean,
how
much...
if
they
followed
your
procedure,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
percentage--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
dues
would
have
been
withheld?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
depends
on
what...
what
proportion
they
estimate.
did
they
at
least...
at
least
tell
us
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
amounts
to
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
5
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
if
they
gave
you
prior
figures
instead
of
estimates
and
it
proved
the
5
or
6
percent
was
correct,
it
would
satisfy
you,
i
guess,
if
they
just
insisted
you
pay
95
percent
of
the
dues
the
first
time,
and
then
you
determine
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it...
would
it
also...
and
why
would
it
not
also
satisfy
you
if
they
said
well,
that's
the
5
percent
in
dispute,
so
we'll
escrow
that
amount,
and
you
get
interest
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
i
think
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
should...
then
i'm
asking
really...
the
rest
of
your
question
is,
what
is
the
constitutional
objection
to
an
interest-bearing
escrow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
not
arguing
that
there
should
be
an
absolute
right
to
withholding
the
5
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
they
concede
that
there's
a
legitimate
argument.
say
5
percent
of
the
budget
goes
for
lobbying,
and
they
think
it's
all
proper,
but
when
anybody
makes
an
objection
they
say,
well,
we'll
set
up
an
escrow
as
to
5
percent
of
that
objector's
dues,
and
keep
paying
interest
on
them
if
it
turns
out...
then
later
on
we'll
work
out
the
arbitration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
really
what
i'm
asking
is,
does
the
escrow
plus
interest
satisfy
your
constitutional
objection
if
all
the
other
requirements
are
met?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
follow
the
procedure
you
recommended,
where
you
make
an
objection
and
you
don't
specify
issue,
they
escrow
some
money
and
then
they
set
up
an
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
is
to
decide
which
matters
are
chargeable
and
which
are
not
chargeable,
may
the
arbitrator
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
ask
your
client
which
issues
he
objects
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
they
come
in
and
they
say
we've
lobbied
for
these
10
issues,
and
here's
how
much
we
spent
on
each
one,
and
now
does
your
client
have
a
duty
to
say
which
ones
he
objects
to
at
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
he
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
the
arbitrator
could
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
think
the
arbitrator--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
he
say
to
him,
i
don't
want
to
have
to
decide
ten
issues
if
only
two
issues
are
in
dispute,
will
you
please
tell
me
which
ones
you
object
to?
you
don't
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
part
of
the
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
constitutional
objection
to
that
as
a
part
of
the
procedure?
has
your
issue-by-issue
argument
taken
it
that
far?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
problem
on
issue-by-issue
is
purely
the
timing
of
your
disclosure
of
what
issues
you
object
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
the
only
objection
is
to
the
timing
of
when
you
must
disclose
which
issues
you
find
objectionable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
two
different
things.
they
have
received
their
10
percent,
or
the
10
percent
has
been
put
in
escrow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
richard,
let
me
just
cut
you
off,
if
i
may.
as
your
opponent
seems
to
say,
past
year's
experience
would
be
an
adequate
basis,
and
that
certainly
would
be
something
you
could
use
so
you
have
some
basis,
and
if
your
lobbying
has
been
5
percent
in
the
prior
year,
why
would
it
be...
i'm
not
saying
it's
constitutionally
compelled,
but
i
don't
understand
the
administrative
problem
with
saying
if
that's
what
it
was
last
year,
why
that's
the
size
of
the
escrow.
isn't
that...
in
fact,
that's
what
i
thought
you
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
made
future
estimates,
is
what
you
did.
that's
a
different--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
percent
of
the
total
charge
to
the
lawyer
is
the
legislative
budget?
what...
what
part
of
the
dues
are
you
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
1.50
out
of
what?
what's
the
total
dues?
i
mean,
at
what
percentage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
couple
percent
of
the
dues,
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
only
talking
about
escrowing
that
amount
for
those
dissidents
who
object
to
use
it
for
some
lobbying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
big
escrow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
won't
reduce,
you
just
escrow
that
portion
of
the
dissenter's
dues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
he
said
he
doesn't
object
to
it
as
long
as
it's
based
on
past
year
rather
than
future
estimates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is...
which
is
more
than
he's
really
entitled
to,
obviously.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
still
only
a
couple
of
percent
of
the
total
dues,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now...
and
what's
wrong
with...
i
mean,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
i
just
don't
know
what
the
fight
is
about
here.
that's
hard--
--well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
conceded
today
that
he
didn't
ask
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least,
i
so
understood
him
because
i
gave
him
that
very
question,
and
he
said
the
escrow
was
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
richard,
could
i
ask
another
question?
what
about
what
he
paid
in
in
the
last
few
years
for
activity
that
has
now
by
the
florida
supreme
court
been
determined
to
have
been
unauthorized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
does
that
mean
that
as
between
the
dispute
between
these
particular
parties
insofar
as
it
relates
to
past
payments
he's
got...
he
either
has
or
is
entitled
to
his
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
understanding
that
somebody's
actually
paid
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
he
got
his
money
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
seems
to
me
if
he
has
maybe...
maybe
the
whole
case
is
moot,
or
at
least
not
much
of
a
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
his
lawyer
knows.
i
suppose
that...
i
suppose
that
you
could
read
this
opinion...
this
later
opinion
in...
as
at
least
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
the
court
says
if
a
lobbying
position
does
not
fall
within
the
guidelines
set
forth
in
schwarz,
it
is
outside
the
ambit
of
permissible
bar
lobbying
activities,
thus
a
petitioner
may
enjoin
the
bar
from
lobbying
on
that
position.
that
is
at
least...
whether
an
injunction,
regardless
of
how
broad
the
injunction
was,
this
is
an
opinion
by
the
supreme
court
that
you...
that...
that
it's
illegal
for
you
to
lobby
on
anything
that
doesn't
satisfy
schwarz.
