justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
the...
why
would...
is
that
clear?
i
mean,
why
would
the
florida
court
hold
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
so
silly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
achieves
nothing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
say,
you
have
to
be
partially
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can't
imagine
that
that's
what...
that's
what
the
florida
courts
mean.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
they're
trying
to
say,
you...
you
can
only
expend
your
money
in
a
way
that
would
be
entirely
constitutional,
so
that
we
don't
have
to
play
these
games
about
segregating
out
the
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
hudson--
justice
antonin
scalia
due
process
requires
that
you
have...
when
lines
are
difficult
to
draw,
due
process
requires
that
you
be
able
to
object
in
advance?
a
lot
of
lines
are
hard
to
draw.
we
just
had
a
school
case.
now,
suppose
you
think
that
some
of
the
courses
in
the
school
may
be
going
to
violate
the
first
amendment,
or
going
to
violate
some
other
provision
of
the
constitution.
are
you
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
to
notice
in
advance
of
what
the
courses
are
going
to
be,
rather
than
just
objecting
when
the
problem
comes
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
proposing
to
take
property.
now,
under
the...
before
the...
what
was
the
name
of
the--
frankel
decision.
--yes.
before
frankel,
they
were
proposing
to
take
property,
and
you
could
plausibly
say
well,
let
me
know
in
advance
how
much
you're
going
to
take.
but
now
they
are
not
proposing
to
take
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
agree
that...
that
if
the
florida
supreme
court's
injunction
is
followed,
and
only
those
subjects
are
lobbied,
at
least
the
lobbying
activities
will
be
in
compliance
with
the
first
amendment
as
far
as
being
able
to
compel
the
dues
are
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
wouldn't
want
that.
[laughter]
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
issue-by-issue
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
very
perceptive.
[laughter]
very
perceptive.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'll
tell
you
what
part
of
the
fight
is
about.
part
of
the
fight
is
about
you
then
make
the
member,
in
order
to
get
any
of
this
money
back,
issue
by
issue,
object
to
the
expenditure
on
this,
to
the
expenditure
on
that.
suppose
a
member
is
just
a
cheapskate,
and
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
spend
any
money
for
lobbying.
i
don't
care
what
the
subjects
of
the
lobbying
are
going
to
be,
if
they
are
not
within
that
narrow
range
of
things
that
you
have
the
constitutional
right
to
take
it
out
of
my
hide,
i
don't
want
to
contribute,
and
i
want
to
let
you
know
this
up-front,
and
i
don't
want
to
have
to
follow
your...
your
stupid
bulletin
that
comes
around
every
month
and
read
what
you're
lobbying
about.
i
don't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
that.
now,
why
isn't
that
entirely
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
let
him
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
advance
he
can
say,
i
want
no
money...
no
money
spent?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that's
what
i'm
concerned
about.
i'm
concerned
about
before
frankel.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if--
--it's
already
escrowed,
you
would
say?
it
is
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
well--
