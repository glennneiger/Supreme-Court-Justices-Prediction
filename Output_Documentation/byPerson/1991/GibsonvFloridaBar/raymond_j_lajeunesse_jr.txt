mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
robert
gibson
is
required
to
be
a
member
of
the
florida
bar
as
a
condition
of
his
practice
of
his
law
in
florida
by
rule
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
he
brought
this
lawsuit
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
collection
of
compulsory
bar
dues
that
are
used
for
political
and
ideological
purposes,
and
on
a
first
appeal
the
11th
circuit
held
that
the
bar,
indeed,
was
violating
his
first
amendment
rights
by
using
his
compulsory
dues
for
political
and
ideological
purposes
unrelated
to
the
bar's
core
regulatory
functions,
thus
anticipating
this
court's
decision
in
keller
v.
california
state
bar.
the
11th
circuit
remanded
the
case
for
the
district
court
to
determine
which
of
the
past
positions
taken
by
the
bar
were
constitutionally
permissible
and
impermissible
uses
of
mr.
gibson's
dues.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i...
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the...
the
frankel
decision,
which
is
the
decision
to
which
justice
kennedy
refers,
merely
held
that
the
bar
may
not
use
compulsory
dues
for
lobbying
purposes
which
do
not
meet
this
court's
keller
test.
it
did
not
go
as
far
as
keller
to
hold
that
compulsory
bar
dues
may
not
be
used
for
all
ideological
activities
not
germane
to
the
bar's
core
regulatory
functions,
so
we
still
have
a
problem
with
regard
to
activities
other
than
lobbying...
for
example,
public
relations,
education
programs,
publications,
matters
which
were
at
issue
in...
in
keller,
in
addition
to
lobbying.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that's--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that's--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--the...
the
problem
arises
because
the
bar's
procedure
addresses
only
legislative
issues.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
that
that's
correct.
on
the
face
of
the
bar's
procedure,
a
member
has
a
right
to
object
only
to
the
use
of
his
dues
when
the
bar
takes
a
position
on
a
legislative
issue,
and
in
any
event,
even
if
the
florida
supreme
court's
frankel
decision
were
interpreted
to
be
congruent
with
keller
in
all
respects,
we
still
have
a
situation
where
the
state
has
created
a
compelled
association,
the
compulsory
bar,
and
given
the
bar
authority
to
potentially
infringe
on
first
amendment
rights
by
not
only
using
the
dues,
but
by
using
the
dues
for
political
and
ideological
purposes.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
and--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--because
the
bar...
as
in
any
circumstance
where
the
state
authorizes
a
situation
which
makes
it
possible
for
first
amendment
rights
to
be
infringed
upon,
the
state
also
has
an
obligation
to
provide
procedures--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
reduce
the
risk
of
that
infringement.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
bar--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--how
can--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--in
the
same
manner
that
this
court
held
that
the
unions
could
do
it
in
the
compulsory
dues
cases,
that
is,
based
upon
prior
experience.
if
we
do
not
rely
upon
prior
experience,
past
expenditures,
in
calculating
this
year's
dues
amount,
you
end
up
with
a
naked
demand
backed
up
by
a
bluff,
the
bluff
of
the
bar
that
everything
we
do
is
chargeable
with
no
appropriate
justification,
which
is
what
this
court
held
was
required
in
hudson.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
case
is
that
different,
your
honor.
in
hudson,
under
the
illinois
statute
and
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
bar...
excuse
me,
the
union
was
permitted
to
charge
all
nonmembers
only
a
proportionate
share
of
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining,
that
is,
a
constitutionally
chargeable
fair
share
fee...
all
nonmembers...
so
you
had
a
state
limitation
on
the
substance
of
what
could
be
collected.
and
this
court
said
in
hudson
that
it...
it's
not
only
a
substantive
limitation
that
is
necessary,
but
that
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
provide
procedural
safeguards
that
make...
reduce
the
risk
that
the
union,
or
in
this
case
the
bar,
will
go
outside
those
substantive
limitations,
and
those
procedural
safeguards
are
very
close
to
the
procedural
safeguards
that
are
necessary
for
any
taking
of
property.
due
process
safeguards
of
a
prior
notice,
in
this
case
a
prior
notice
in
which
the
bar
would
justify
the
amount
of
the
fee,
the
compulsory
dues
that
it's
charging
to
a
member
who
wishes
to
object,
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
that's
not
the
notice
here,
your
honor.
the
notice
here,
your
honor,
is
a
notice
that's
given
after
the
bar
has
already
taken
the
legislative
position,
and
as
the
11th
circuit
recognized,
already
spent
some
of
the
money,
so
you'll
have...
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
objector
has
already
been
irreparably
harmed,
and
we...
and
the
only
remedy
is
the
rebate
remedy,
which
this
court
condemned
with
regard
to
the
unions
in
both
ellis
and
in
hudson.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
which
they
don't
do
now,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
what
more
should
they
do,
your
honor?
they
should
send
out
a
comprehensive
breakdown
of
their
budget...
when
i
say
budget,
i
mean
prior
year's
expenditures,
which
should
be
the
basis
for
the
calculation
of
the
dues
amount,
showing
the
major
categories
of
expenditures,
and
in
each
category
breaking
it
down
between
chargeable
and
nonchargeable
expenditures,
and
a
sufficient--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--if...
if
they're
claiming
that
all
of
their
expenditures
are
chargeable--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--if
they're
claiming
that
all
of
their
expenditures
are
chargeable,
then
they
should
not
simply
make
that
a
boldfaced...
as
i
say,
bluff,
by
saying
all
of
our
expenses
are
chargeable--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
they
should...
they
should
give
some
detail.
what
types
of
legislation
are
we
supporting--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--how
much
are
we
spending
on
that
legislation--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
they
need
to
at
that
point
also
attach
some
dollars
so
that
when
the
member
objects,
that
portion
which
is
in
dispute
can
be
escrowed.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
want...
i
don't
just
want
it,
your
honor.
this
court
held
in
hudson--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
an
escrow
was
necessary.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
if
they
make
a
mistake...
and
they
admit
in
their
brief
that
they're
not
infallible,
and
we
know
from
frankel
that
they're
not
infallible
because
in
the
last
fiscal
year
in
fact
they
did--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
they
should
follow
the
same
type
of
procedure
that
this
court
prescribed
for
the
unions
in
hudson,
and
that
is,
when
they
calculate
the
chargeable
amount
of
the
dues
at
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
they
do
it
based
upon
the
prior
year's
experience--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--it
is
up--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--it
is
up
to
the...
mr.
gibson
to
object.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
is
then
up
to
the
bar
to
justify
that
charge
that
they've
claimed
to
an
arbitrator
and,
in
the
interim,
if
they
are
going
to
escrow
less
than
100
percent
of
the
dues,
they
must,
as
this
court
held
in
hudson
with
regard
to
the
unions,
verify
by
an
independent
auditor--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
escrow
of
less
than
100
percent.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
in
order
to
protect...
because,
as
the
bar
points
out
in
its
brief,
the
line
between
chargeable
and
nonchargeable
activities
is
difficult
to
draw,
and
there
has
to...
and
the
bar
can
make
mistakes.
it
has
made
mistakes.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
think
you
are
under
this
court's
due
process
decisions
when
the
taking
of
property
is
involved.
we're
talking
here
about
taking
a
man's
property.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
after
frankel,
your
honor,
they're
still
collecting
the
dues.
isn't
that
a
taking
of
property?
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
there's
a
very--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
there's
a
very
fundamental
distinction
between
the
state
taking
taxes
for
the
state's
general
purposes
and
the
bar's
taking
compulsory
dues
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
association
with
the
bar.
that
is,
the
very
purpose
of
the
collection
of
dues
is
an
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
to
a
limited
extent
that
infringement
is
justified
by
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
but
nonetheless
there
still
must
be
a
carefully
tailored
procedure
to
ensure
that
that
infringement
goes
no
further
than
necessary
to
meet
the
compelling
governmental
interest,
which
is
the
support
of
the
bar's
regulatory
functions.
there's
no
reason...
and
i
must...
i
must
go
back
in
response
to
justice
kennedy
that
we...
we
also
have
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
this
procedure
for
the
5
years
that
it
operated
before
frankel,
in
which
the
bar
was
operating
under
the
assumption
that
it
could
engage
in
nonchargeable
activities
so
long
as
it
had
a
procedure
that
met
the
requirements
of
hudson.
so
that
question
is
not
moot.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
district
court--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--denied--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
under
the
bar...
the
bar's
procedure
operates
only
prospectively.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
didn't...
did
not
even...
they
gave
a
notice
of
the
taking
of
a
position
of
a
legislative
issue.
you've
got
45
days
to
object,
specifying
the
issue
to
which
you
object,
thus
violating
this
court's
holding
in
abood
that
you
can
only
be
required
to
make
a
general
objection.
the
procedure
which
would
meet
first
amendment
due
process
in
this
case
is
one
in
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
the
bar
would
make
a
comprehensive
disclosure
based
upon
prior
years'
expenses,
so
that
we
have
actual
expenses
that
can
be
independently
verified,
as
this
court
held
was
necessary
in
hudson
to
avoid
two
things;
(1)
projected
expenditures,
as
the
bar
uses
here,
are
merely
estimates,
and
the
bar
does
not
have
to
follow
those
estimates
during
the
course
of
the
fiscal
year,
and
secondly,
estimates
cannot
be
audited.
they
cannot
be
verified,
and
thus
you
have
no
independent
reliable
check
on
the
bar's
self-interest
in
maximizing
the
amount
of
the
fee.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
the
bar
has
never
made
a
disclosure
of
the
kind
that
would
enable
me
to
even
estimate
what
portion
in
the
past
was
used
for
chargeable
and...
for
nonchargeable
purposes--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
they
claim
it
was
only
the
legislative
expenditures--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--which
is
5
percent--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--but
publication--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--if
they
provided
the
notice
justifying
the
95
percent,
yes.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
if...
if
that
breakdown--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--saying
that
all
of
these...
the
95
percent
is
arguably
chargeable
and
5
percent
is
nonchargeable
was
audited,
the
5
percent--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that
they
concede
is
nonchargeable
shouldn't
be
escrowed,
it
should
be--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--none,
your
honor,
if
it
is
independently
verified
as
this
court
required
in
hudson.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
if
they...
if
they
concede
that
5
percent
is
nonchargeable--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
understand
the
question
now,
your
honor.
yes,
if
they
say
that
5
percent
of
the
amount
that
they
claim
is
chargeable
is
reasonably
disputable,
and
that
calculation
of
5
percent
has
been
independently
verified
as
the
court
held
was
required
in
hudson,
then
only
that
5
percent
need
be
escrowed.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
if
all
the
other
requirements
are
met,
if
the
requirement
of
adequate
prior
notice,
exclusion
from
the
amount
collected
of
all
admittedly
verified
nonchargeable
expenses,
then
the
escrow
verified
of
the
part
that's
reasonably
in
dispute
does
satisfy
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
they...
they
cannot
spend...
in
other
words,
they
must
be...
they
cannot
be
permitted
to
spend
monies
that
they
admit
are
arguably
nonchargeable.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
under
a
proper
procedure,
if
the
notice
is
given
prior
to
the
taking,
and
the
member
has
an
opportunity
to
object
prior
to
the
taking,
which
is
the
normal
case
in
due
process--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
they
would
give
a
comprehensive
notice
explaining
the
basis
for
the
dues
amount.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
think
that...
this
court
in
abood
held
that
that
issue-by-issue
requirement,
objection
requirement
was
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons,
first
because
it
requires
the
member
to
continually
monitor,
in
this
case
the
bar's
publications
in
order
to
see
what
the
bar
is
doing,
see
whether
it's
given
this
notice
that
it's
taken
a
position
on
an
objectionable
issue,
and...
a
potentially
objectionable
issue...
and
by
requiring
him
to
object
to
specific
positions
it
invades
privacy
of
belief,
because
by
implication
that
says
you're
opposed
to
those
issues
to
which
you
object.
and
i
would
add
here,
there's
a
further
problem
that
under
the
bar's
scheme
you
have
to
participate
in
more
than
one
arbitration,
because
under
the
bar's
scheme
if
you
make
an
objection
to
a
specific
legislative
issue,
that
sets
in
motion
a
process
by
which
if
the
bar
does
not
make
a
refund
for
that
issue,
does
not
agree
with
your
objection,
you
go
to
arbitration
within
a
time
period
on
that
issue.
so
i
think
the...
to
summarize,
even
after
frankel
the
bar
has
to
justify
its
proposed
taking
of
property,
of
the
member's
money,
the
dues
amount,
with
a
notice
that
explains
that
dues
amount,
and
after
frankel
justifies
its
claim
that
it's
all
chargeable,
that
has
to
be
an
audited
explanation.
the
nonmember
can
then
make
a
single
general
objection,
saying
i
think
you've
calculated
the
dues
amount
too
high,
that
some
of
the
activities
you've
included
i
don't
agree
with,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
specify
what
they
are
at
that
stage
because
that
would
violate
the
principle
of
abood
that
he
does
not
have
to
disclose
his
beliefs.
the
portion
that
then
the
auditor
has
determined
falls
within
the
arguably...
the
arguable,
the
gray
area,
gets
put
into
escrow
while
the
arbitration
occurs.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
first
amendment
requires
that
result.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i...
i
think
the
florida
bar
can
establish
whatever
limits
it
wants
upon
the
functions
in
which
the
bar
is
engaged.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
on
the
ground
that
that
did
not
fall
within
the
statutory
purposes
of
the
florida
bar,
or
the
state
law
purposes
of
the
florida
bar.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
is
limited
by
the
first
amendment
from
voluntarily
circumscribing
the
functions
of
the
state
bar.
now,
if
that
injunction
had
run
against
a
voluntary
section
of
the
bar,
or
had
run
against
the
bar's
political
action
committee,
which
are
separate
entities
from
the
state
bar,
then
that
would
be
a
question
of
limiting
voluntary
associations,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
state
bar,
which
is
a
compulsory
bar.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
your
honor,
this
case
does
not
raise
the
issue
of
whether
the
bar's
definition
of
what
complies
with
keller
is
proper
or
not.
i
would
be
giving
my
personal
opinion
outside--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--the
issues
presented
by
this
case,
were
i
to
answer
that
question
directly.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
think
at
the
arbitration
hearing
the
bar
has
the
burden
of
justifying
its
expenditures,
but
once
it
makes
a
prima
facie
case
that
satisfies
the
arbitrator,
any
attorney
participating
in
an
arbitration
would
be
foolish
not
to
more
specifically
give
his
rebuttal
to
the
bar's
prima
facie
case.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
he
has
a
duty,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
he
may...
he
may
lose
the
case
before
the
arbitrator--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--because
the
arbitrator
knows
the
bar
has
made
a
prima
facie
case--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
you
haven't
rebutted
it.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
might
be.
i
hadn't
thought
that
through
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
that's...
i
think
that's
normal
to
litigation
that
you--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--because
the
bar
is
infringing
on
first
amendment
rights
and
it
has--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i
think
some
disclosure
has
to
be
made
in
the
sense
of
the
process
of
litigation.
once
you
participate
in
litigation,
you
sometimes
have
to
disclose
things
that
otherwise
you
could
keep
private
under
the
first
amendment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i'd
like
to
very
quickly
make
two
or
three
points.
one,
justice
stevens,
i
did
not
concede
that
if
the
bar,
as
was
the
case
pre-frankel,
engages
in
constitutionally
nonchargeable
activities,
that
advance
reduction
is
not
required
in
addition
to
escrow.
i
think
both
are
required
if
the
bar
is
not
limited
by
state
law
to
only
constitutionally
chargeable
purposes.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
it
is
now.
i
think
that
ruling
and
its
own
procedure
applies
only
to
legislative
activities.
now,
we've
had
a
statement
from
counsel
here
for
the
first
time
to
this
court
in
argument
that
frankel,
and
its
own
procedure,
which
says
on
the
face
you
can
object
to
legislative
positions,
period,
only
those
legislative
positions
which
the
bar
gives
you
notice
of
in
its
twice-monthly
publication.
that's
all
that
procedure
covers.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
counsel
suggested
that
mr.
gibson
is
going
to
get
some
restitution
as
a
result
of
the
frankel
decision.
that
is
simply
not
true.
the
frankel
decision
only
applies
to
parties
in
that
case.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
