mr.
barry
scott
richard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
questions
that
were
raised
by
justice
kennedy
and
justice
white.
with
regard
to
the
frankel
decision,
counsel
has
suggested
that
the
frankel
decision
was
limited
solely
to
legislative
positions.
the
reason
for
that
is
because
those
were
the
only
positions
that
were
challenged
in
the
frankel
case
by
the
petitioners,
just
as
they
are
the
only
petitions...
the
only
positions
that
have
been
challenged
in
this
case.
however,
it
is
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
that
the
abood
criteria,
the
requirements
of
hudson,
are
not
limited
to
legislative
lobbying
positions,
and
as
far
as
the
florida
bar
is
concerned,
it
reads
its
own
supreme
court
decision
as
being
as
extensive
as
are
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
keller.
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
would
make
no
sense,
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
attempt
to
distinguish
between
the
two
and
so,
as
we
understand
that
ruling,
we
are
limited
as
to
all
political
and
ideological
purposes
to
the
parameters
of
keller
and
abood.
with
regard
to
justice--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--i
can
read,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
second,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
justice
kennedy's
suggestion
that
perhaps
this
case
is
moot
if
not
insignificant,
while
it
may
be
that
with
regard
to
florida
it
is
moot,
the
fact
is
a
split
continues
to
exist
in
the
various
circuits,
and
because
this
court
may
want
to
address
this
issue,
i
will
address
it
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
florida
supreme
court
had
taken
the
position
that
it
did
in
the
frankel
case,
and
i
will
do
that
in
just
a
moment.
first,
however,
i
would
like
to
also
address
the
question
that
was
raised
by
justice
white
regarding
whether
or
not
injunction
would
be
at...
whether
or
not
that
florida's
interpretation...
that
florida's
interpretation
of
the
frankel
case...
is
consistent
with
this
court's
ruling
in
keller.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is,
indeed,
consistent.
as
this
court
said
in
keller,
the
issue
is
not
the
terminology
but
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court.
the
reason
that
this
court
struck
down
the
california
court's
interpretation
is
because
even
though,
as
this
court
noted,
its
language
appeared
to
be
the
same
as
the
language
of
this
court,
it
had
so
broadly
interpreted
it
that
it
essentially
allowed
any
lobbying.
quite
the
contrary.
in
its
first
test
of
the
criteria
that
it
had
earlier
established
in
the
schwarz
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
gave
an
extremely
narrow
interpretation
which
clearly
falls
within
the
scope
of
keller,
and
essentially
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said
in
interpreting
those
additional
three
criteria
was
that
it
must
be...
that
when
they
say
that
it
must
be
an
issue
upon
which
attorneys
have
special
expertise,
that
means
it
must
have
to
do
with
the
administration
of
the
system
of
justice
as
opposed
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
legislation.
now,
the
essential
point
here
is
that
this
court
does
not
have
before
it
now
a
case
in
which
the
interpretation
by
the
florida
supreme
court
by
anybody's
measure
is
beyond
keller
or
abood,
and
there
will
be
no
issue
until
such
time
as
a
petitioner
brings
a
case
to
this
court
or
another
federal
court
in
which
the
florida
courts
have
interpreted
it
in
an
expansive
manner
that
violates
those
cases.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
address
this
question,
as
i
said,
in
an
even
broader
sense.
i
think,
as
comments
from
the
justices
have
already
indicated,
that
there
is
no
question
that
given
the
current
interpretation
by
florida's
supreme
court,
that
this
case
squarely
meets
the
requirements
of
abood
and
of
keller
with
regard
to
advance
reduction,
but
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
even
before
the
frankel
decision,
and
even
with
respect
to
those
states
that
have
not
gone
so
far
as
florida,
advance
reduction
which
has
never
been
mandated
by
this
court
simply
makes
no
sense.
it
rests
upon
the
assumption
that
there
is
only
one
interest
here
to
be
served,
the
interest
of
the
dissenters,
and
that
that
interest
is
to
be
served
and
that
the
convenience
of
the
dissenters
is
to
be
served
without
regard
for
any
other
interest,
and
that
flies
in
the
face
of
what
this
court
has
said
consistently
when
it
has
cautioned
district
courts
that
they
are
to
balance
the
interests
of
the
dissenters
against
the
right
and
the
necessity
for
the
organization
to
have
the
ability
to
fund
those
activities
which
are
germane,
and
there
is
no
way,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court,
that
advance
reduction
can
accomplish
that
purpose,
and
i
will
illustrate.
let
us
assume
that
the
dissenters
have
demanded
their
escrow
and
that
a
determination
has
been
made
at
some
point
that
it
was
10
percent
of
the
budget,
and
they
have
received
their
10
percent.
now,
in
what
manner--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--it's
been
escrowed,
and
eventually
let's
assume
it
was
determined
that
it
was
nonchargeable
and
they
received
the
money.
let's
assume
the
most
extreme
circumstance
in
which
the
determination
was
in
their
favor.
now,
in
what
manner
are
you
to
reduce
next
year,
when
what
we
are
talking
about...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
reduction
is
certainly
practicable.
for
instance,
if
you've
got
a
labor
union
which
knows
that
it
is
going
to
allocate
10
percent
of
its
budget
to
campaign
contributions,
surely
that's
a
simple
matter
of
reduction.
however,
if
you're
dealing
with
a
legislative
situation,
then
as
justice
souter
mentioned
in
the
chapman
case
in
new
hampshire,
it's
an
extremely
complicated
and
never
a
wholly
satisfactory
system
to
advance
reduce,
because
what
do
you
reduce?
florida's
court
is
typical.
it
budgets
a
lump
sum
amount
to
lobbying.
why?
because
nobody
knows
what
percentage
of
lobbying
is
going
to
go
to
what
issues
in
any
given
year.
nobody
knows
what
issues
are
coming
up,
nobody
knows
how
many
committees
are
going
to
take
up
a
bill,
nobody
knows
until
it's
all
over,
and
then
what
you
do
is
you
sit
down
and
you
allocate
it
according
to
the
percentage
of
the
time
that
your
lobbyists
spent
on
one
issue
or
another
issue.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
it's
not
what--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--no,
what
florida
actually
does,
and
counsel
has
objected
it's
not
in
the
record,
and
it's
not,
but
if
it's
of
interest
to
you,
what
we
do
is,
because
we
don't
know
in
advance,
we
escrow
100
percent
of
the
legislative
budget
until
our
auditor
determines
what
it
is,
because
we
don't
know
any
other
way
to
do
it.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
record
here
reflects
that
when
this
case
began
about
5
years
ago
it
was
around
$
1.
50.
i
don't
know
how
accurate
that
is.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think
my
dues
are
around
something
between
$
100
and
$
200.
i
don't
remember
exactly.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
but
the
problem
though,
your
honor,
is
this.
the
problem
is
one
of
principle,
and
if
i
can
illustrate
it
i'll
show
you
what
i
mean.
let's
assume
that
we
do
what
your
honor
has
suggested
as
a
hypothet,
which
is
that
we
reduce
in
the
future
years
by
the
previous
year's
budget.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you.
we
do
do
that.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
but
we--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--no,
no.
we
do
it
more
accurately.
instead
of...
instead
of...
instead
of
escrowing
by
last
year
we
escrow
by
the
total
amount
we
budgeted
this
year
for
the
whole
legislative
budget.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i'm
not
sure
i
do,
either.
[laughter]
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
is
reasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
we
do.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
he
may,
your
honor.
the
problem
here
is...
that's
not
where
the
problem
lies
here,
or
the
dispute.
the
problem
is,
what
kicks
into
play
escrow
and
arbitration.
the
point
here
is
that
we
are
not
dealing,
as
this
court
was
in
the
abood
case
with
what
it
referred
to
as
the...
shifting...
the
necessity
to
sift
through
shifting
and
numerous
expenditures
for
nongermane
purposes.
here's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
the
florida
bar
says...
and
by
the
way,
the
rules
which
are
in
the
record
reflect
that
before
the
florida
bar
board
of
governors
votes
to
take
a
position
they
must,
by
two-thirds
vote,
first
agree
that
it
is
germane
to
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
is
its
permissible
area,
so
first
they
must
make
that
decision
so
that
in
every
case
the
board
has
already
determined...
has
already
determined
that
it
is
germane.
now,
the
petitioner
comes
along
and
says,
we
don't
want
you
to
spend
our
money
on
any
nongermane
purposes,
and
the
answer
a
fortiori
is,
we're
not.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
even
before
the
frankel
decision,
your
honor--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--because
we
are
not
saying
to
the
individual,
as
was
the
case
in
abood,
you
must
tell
us
what
your
position
is
on
each
individual
issue
which
is
nongermane.
all
we're
saying,
as
the
11th
circuit
recognized
is,
where
do
you
disagree
with
us
as
to
what's
germane?
if
it's
nongermane
we're
not
going
to
spend
your
money.
if
you
think
we're
wrong--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--tell
us
what's
nongermane
so
that
we
know
what
it
is
that
we're
disputing.
as
this
court
said,
what's
the
dispute?
we're
saying,
what's
the
dispute.
now,
counsel,
in
what
i
think
is
a
highly
significant
acknowledgement
said,
as
this
court
has
said,
once
you
get
into
the
litigation
process,
you
have
to
tell
the
court
what
your
objection
is.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
fail
to
see
the
distinction.
again,
we
thoroughly
understand
what
this
court
has
said,
and
endorse
it,
which
is
that
you
cannot
make
the
petitioner
take...
announce
his
position
on
the
subject
matter
one
way
or
the
other.
all
we're
asking
him
them
here
is,
where
do
you
think
we
are
wrong
in
our
determination
that
it
is
germane
or
nongermane,
and
then
we
know
how
much
escrow,
we
know
whether
or
not
to
take
it
to--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--it's
escrowed
as
soon
as
he
tells
us,
right.
if
i
might,
by
the
way,
go
back
for
just
a
moment
to
advance
reduction,
because
there
was
a
point
i
wanted
to
make
there
which
i
think
has
broader
significance
than
this.
the
problem
is
this.
if...
what
i...
what
in
their
briefs
the
petitioners
were
calling
for
was
in
fact
not
an
escrow
but
an
advance
reduction
the
following
year
in
their
dues--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
have
no
problem.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
my
main
concern
with
that
is
it
does
exactly
what
this
court's
trying
to
avoid.
it
then
shifts
the
burden
to
all
the
nondissenters
to
pick
up
a
percentage
that
they
may
not--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--that's
correct,
because
that
was
the
only
issue
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
but
again,
we
read
it
as
being
broad
and
we
would
have
no
objection
to
this
court
saying
that...
that
it--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--of
course,
this
court
wouldn't
say
what
the
supreme
court
limits--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--but
we
would...
that's...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
and
if
the
petitioner
says
we
have
done
it,
which
our
rules
provide
them
an
opportunity
to
say,
then
we
must
immediately
escrow
his
funds
and
eventually
if
he
proves
to
be
correct,
either
give
the
money
back
or...
or
give
it
back
with
interest
from
the
date
that
the
position
was
taken
by
the
bar.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
and
we're
bound
to
that
by
the
11th
circuit's
decision.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
sir.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that's
not
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
i
think
we
certainly
would
have
to
escrow
it
as
soon
as
somebody
files
an
objection,
and
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
if
we
knew
in
advance
what
the
percentage
was
to
escrow
it
even
if
they
did
not
file
an
objection.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--if
what
your
honor
is
saying...
and
i...
i
believe
i
understand
you...
this
court
has
said
that
there
always
must
be
an
objection
raised,
that
the
initial
burden
is,
of
course,
the
petitioner.
i
understand,
your
honor,
what
you're
saying
is
that
once
the
petitioner
has
said,
i
file
an
objection,
if
the
bar
then
knows
that
it's
going
to
spend
a
percentage
of
money
on
a
nongermane
purpose,
that
it
then
must
return
that
money
to
that
petitioner
and
we
would
agree
wholeheartedly
with
that.
we
have
no
problem
with
that
suggestion.
the
difficulty
here
is--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
not
only
that,
but
what
the
petitioner,
as
i
understand
it,
is
suggesting,
is
that
he
does
not
even
have
to
advise
the
bar
when
he
thinks
the
bar
has
arrived
at
an
incorrect
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
germane.
now...
now
what
does
that
call
upon
us
to
do,
then?
must
we
escrow
automatically
all
funds,
which
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
continuing
suggestion
that
the
organization
should
not
have
to
have
a
100
percent
escrow,
or
are
we
to
send
every
issue
once
a
single
petitioner
has
objected
to
costly
arbitration,
thereby
again
placing
an
undue
burden
upon
the
nondissenters?
my
point
is
that
the
florida
bar
has
adequately
and
constitutionally
fully
accommodated
all
first
amendment
requirements
as
soon
as
we
immediately
escrow
money
which...
which
accounts
for
the
percentage
of
the
item
that
the
petitioner
has
suggested
is
not
germane
and
given
him
an
opportunity
in
florida
which
is
twofold,
either
to
go
to
arbitration
or
to
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court
on
a
petition.
all
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
your
honor,
the...
the
rule--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--i
would
say
we
should.
the
rule
doesn't
speak
to
that
since
it
doesn't
recognize--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--well,
no,
sir.
[laughter]
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
florida's
rule
requires
a
decision
before
its
ever
announced
that
it's
germane,
so
florida
doesn't
recognize
its
right
to
allocate
that
money
to
a
nongermane
purpose,
so
the
decision's
already
been
made
by
the
board
that
it's
germane.
now,
the
question
is
whether
there's
an
adequate
system
for
the
petitioner
to
disagree
with
us,
and
our
position
is
there
is
a
more
than
adequate
system.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
we
have
been
ordered
to
refund
with
interest
from
the
appropriate
date
all
sums
that
were
paid
in
by
those
who
adequately
raised
the
issue.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that
is
our
understanding.
past
payments
as
to
those
issues
upon
which
he
gave--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--that
somebody
has
paid
him?
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
couldn't
honestly
tell
you
whether
or
not
he's
gotten
his
money
back.
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
case
is
not
finally
adjudicated--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
--yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
occurred
to
me
after
you
asked
the
question
about
the
injunction
before
to
make
another
comment
that
i
forgot,
so
i'm
glad
you've
raised
it
again.
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
was
not
acting
in
an
adjudicatory
capacity
with
regard
to
the
injunction.
they
were
acting
as
the
administrative
head
of
the
florida
bar,
which
in
florida
the
supreme
court
is,
and
they
were
advising
the
florida
bar
that
they
could
not
extend
beyond
keller
in
any
case.
the
injunction
was
secondary,
because
the
court
was
saying
this
is
an
appropriate
remedy,
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
certainly
the
intention
of
the
court
to
advise
the
bar
of,
its
administrative
limits.
they
said,
your
charter
allows
you
not
to
go
beyond
this.
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
notice,
your
honor,
the
florida
bar
publishes
all
of
the
notice
that
i
believe
is
reasonably
possible,
as
well
as
all
of
the
notice
that
is
constitutionally
required.
we
have
a
rule
adopted
and
imposed
by
the
supreme
court
that
requires
florida
to
give
notice
of
the
entire
budget
process,
point
by
point.
we
give
notice
to
the
membership
as
soon
as
it
is
adopted
of
every
item
in
the
budget,
we
give
notice
as
the
court
knows
of
every
position
taken
politically.
there
is
nothing
more
to
tell
the
petitioners.
if
the
petitioners
are
suggesting
that
we
need
to
break
the
budget
down
into
smaller
quantities,
i
know
of
no
constitutional
provision
that
requires
the
florida
bar
or
any
other
agency
to
break
its
budget
down
into
any
particular
size
items.
the
point
is,
we're
not,
as
is
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioners,
being
disingenuous
here
or
being
arrogant.
we
are
simply
adopting
the
only
budget
that
the
bar
is
able
to
adopt,
and
we
are
attempting,
as
i
believe
most
if
not
all
bars
and
this
court
is,
to
struggle
with
the
question
of
how
to
balance
the
legitimate
rights
of
the
petitioners
against
the
necessity
to
ensure
that
the
costs
involved
are
evenly
spread
with
regard
to
legitimate,
germane
functions.
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
with
the
court's
permission,
i
quote
46,000.
i'm
advised
by
cocounsel,
who
is
general
counsel
for
the
bar.
i
believe,
by
the
way,
that
is
in
the
record
in
one
of
the
documents.
