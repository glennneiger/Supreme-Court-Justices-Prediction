but
are...
are
you
conceding
that
they
don't
have
to
escrow
until
someone
affirmatively
objects?
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
event
triggers
their
obligation
to
set
up
the
escrow,
on
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
so
you're...
you're
receding
from
your...
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
you.
you're
receding
from
the
argument
that
it
would
be
a
violation
to
require
the
member
to
make
an
affirmative
objection
in
every
case
because
that
would
force
him
to
reveal
his
opinions.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
there's...
there's
no
objection
to
his
saying,
okay,
i
want
the
5
percent
escrowed.
your
objection
would
simply
be
if
they
required
him
on
an
issue-by-issue
basis
later
on.
