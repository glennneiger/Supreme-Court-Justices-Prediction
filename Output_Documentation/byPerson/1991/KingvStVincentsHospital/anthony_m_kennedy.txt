justice
kennedy
what...
can
you
explain
it
to
me
why
is
it
that
the
government
says
this
is
not
an
initial
period
of
active
duty
for
training?
this
is
something
else?
justice
kennedy
what
is
it?
justice
kennedy
and
that's
different
from
an
initial
period
of
active
duty
for
training?
justice
kennedy
i
don't
understand
that
because
that
says
for
not
less
than
<twelve>
[=
12]
consecutive
weeks.
justice
kennedy
it
has
to
be
more
than
90--
justice
kennedy
--this
is
a
new
job.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
why
this
wasn't
an
initial
period
of
active
duty.
it
was
an
entirely
new
position
for
him.
justice
kennedy
and
it
was
longer
than
12
weeks,
so
he's
not
covered
by
(c),
so
(d)
clicks
in.
justice
kennedy
well,
we
will
see
what
we
can
do,
but
ms.
wax
tells
us
that
that's
not
permissible.
