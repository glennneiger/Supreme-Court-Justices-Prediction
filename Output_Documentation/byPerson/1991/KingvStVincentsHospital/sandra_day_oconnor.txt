justice
o'connor
ms.
wax,
do
you
think
we
owe
deference
to
the
most
recent
veterans'
reemployment
rights
handbook
regulations
in
this
area
in
light
of
the
very
dramatic
shifts
by
the
department
of
labor
in
their
view
of
this
statute
and
its
requirements
over
the
years?
justice
o'connor
ms.
wax,
i
know
it's
irrelevant
to
our
decision
in
the
case,
but
are
there
any
pending
efforts
in
congress
to
sort
of
make
these
statutes
a
little
more
compatible
than
they
are
now
in
the
fashion
they
ask
they
be
interpreted?
justice
o'connor
because
it
just
doesn't
fit
together
the
way
you
would
think
it
would
if
somebody
were
looking
at
the
whole
problem
and
trying
to
draft
legislation.
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
hopkins,
didn't
ms.
wax
tell
us
that
the
term
(c)
is
a
term
of
art
and
doesn't
cover
this
person?
justice
o'connor
now,
i
don't
enough
about
army
regulations
to
know,
but
was
that
her
explanation?
