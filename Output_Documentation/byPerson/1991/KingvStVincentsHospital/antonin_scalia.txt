no
limit?
there's
no
time
limit
whatever?
justice
scalia
you
think...
so
you
say...
and
he
has
to
be
permitted
to
return?
i
mean
it
could
be
as
long
as
12
years,
i
assume,
if
he
takes
two
tours
of
duty
under
some
of
these
things.
and
he
has
to
be
permitted
to
return
with
the
same
seniority
he
would
have
had
if
he
had
stayed,
even
though
he's
been
away
for
12
years.
justice
scalia
what
if
the
employer
has
abolished
the
position
when
the
person
wants
to
come
back,
he
just
no
longer
has
that?
justice
scalia
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
what
that
flows
from
because
i
no
more
see
that
in
the
text
of
this
provision
than
i
see
any
time
limit,
and
i
wonder
why
you're
willing
to
imply
the
one
but
not
imply
the
other?
justice
scalia
by
implication.
justice
scalia
ms.
wax,
what
you
said
earlier
about
how
accepting
the
respondent's
position
would
cause
national
guard
members
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
compared
with
federal
reserve
members,
what
provision
governing
members
of
the
federal
reserve
did
you
have
in
mind?
justice
scalia
but
is
(b)
that
covers
them.
justice
scalia
yes,
the
federal.
justice
scalia
which
is
what
i
suspected,
although
i
didn't
know
how
you
got
there.
but
(b)
does
at
least
have
some
limitation
period,
does
it
not?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
and
you're
arguing...
i
mean,
so
you
argue,
gee,
the...
you
know,
if
you
accept
the
respondent's
position,
federal
reservists
will
be
treated
enormously
more
favorable
than
national
guard
people.
but
he
can
make
just
the...
a
similar
argument.
he
says,
if
he
accepts
you
position,
national
guard
will
be
treated
more
favorable
then
the
federal
reserve,
which
seems
even
more
absurd.
there's
no
way
to
make
it
work.
justice
scalia
well,
you'd
have
to
do
it,
like
it
or
not,
under
some
of
the
other
provisions
of
section
2024.
justice
scalia
then
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
that
justice
stevens
has
been
talking
about
if
it
was
not
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
hopkins,
i
guess
the
only,
for
those
of
us
who,
you
know,
believe
in
words,
what
you're
trying
to
invite
us
to
hang
the
difference
on,
i
guess,
i
think,
is
the
phrase
"leave"...
"leave
of
absence".
is
that
included
in
any
of
the
other
provisions
here?
none
of
these
other
provisions
use
that
term.
justice
scalia
they
just
say
he
must
be
rehired.
and
your
argument
is
when
they
say
leave
of
absence
there,
they're
talking
about
something
that
you
say
must
be...
shall
be...
shall
upon
request
be
granted
a
leave
of
absence,
they
obviously
mean,
what
in
your
view,
a
leave
of
absence
always
means...
that
is,
a
relatively
brief
permission
for
departure.
justice
scalia
he
doesn't
even
have
to
give
notice
before
he
comes
back,
right?
he
just
shows
up
the
day
after
the
release...
after
he's
released
from
the
army.
there's
a
new
supervisor,
it's
12
years
later,
and
he
says,
well,
here
i
am.
the
supervisor
says
who
are
you.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know,
maybe
i'm
reading
these
wrong.
is
there
a
difference
between
being
ordered
to
an
initial
period
of
active
duty
and
volunteering?
i
mean,
(c)
applies
to
any
member
of
reserve
component
who
is
ordered
to
an
initial
period
of
active
duty
for
training
of
not
less
than
12
consecutive
weeks,
whereas
this
fellow
really
said
take
me.
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
make
the
difference?
justice
scalia
well,
then
i
don't
see
why
he's
not
covered
by
(c)
either.
but
you
seem
to
concede
he's
not
covered
by
(c)?
justice
scalia
what
way?
interpreted
what
way?
as
though
it
did
not
exist?
justice
scalia
no,
no.
how
do
you
interpret
the
word
"initial"
that
it
would
cover
this
situation?
justice
scalia
so
what
you're
saying
is
if
we
choose
to
ignore
the
word
"initial"
you
don't
mind.
