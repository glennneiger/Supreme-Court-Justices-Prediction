were
any
of
those
short
training
leaves
at
the
time
the
statute
was
first
enacted
wholly
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
this
one
was
not?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
this
particular
individual
applied
for
this
3-year
duty.
i
mean,
he
put
himself
in
a
position

being
ordered
to
be
away
3
years.

the
short-term
trainees
to
whom
you
referred
in

position

they
would

subjected

that
was
kind
of
essential
to
the
status
of
being
a
reservist,

this
particular
training
assignment

not.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?

this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
we
took
the
case
to
resolve
a
split
between
the
third,
fifth,
and
eleventh
circuits
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
other
on
the
question
whether
38
u.s.
code
2024(d)
implicitly
limits
the
length
of
military
service
after
which
a
member
of
the
military
protected
by
this
section
retains
a
right
to
reemployment
in
the
civilian
job
he
filed
prior
to
his
duty.
we
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit
and
holding
that
the
statute
provides
no
such
limitations.
nothing
in
the
plain
language
of
the
section
limits
the
duration
of
such
military
leaves
and
the
structure
of
the
statutory
scheme
fails
to
support
the
hospital's
argument
that
the
benefit
provided
by
the
section
falls
at
the
bottom
of
a
hierarchy
of
employment
rights
so
as
to
indicate
congressional
intent
to
limit
the
provision's
protection
to
those
whose
leave
request
are
found
to
be
reasonable.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
all
members
of
the
court
except
justice
thomas
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
