justice
stevens
yes,
but
under
that
one,
i
guess
it's
under
(b)(2),
he's
got
to
reapply,
doesn't
he,
for
a
job?
justice
stevens
and
here
he
just
shows
up
and
says
i
want
to
go
to
work.
justice
stevens
and
also,
isn't
there
a
difference
in
their
protection
from
discharge
after
they
get
back?
justice
stevens
how
does
it
make
sense
to
say
you're
protected
from
discharge
under
(a)
and
(b)
and
you
get
no
protection
under
(d),
when
you
might
be
away
even
longer,
as
you
say?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
why
should
they
have
to
reapply
instead
of
just
showing
up
like
these
people
do?
justice
stevens
that
cuts
the
other
way
on
that
part
of
it.
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
were
going
to
answer
by
saying
when
it
was
originally
drafted,
(d)
really
did
just
apply
to
short
leaves
for
training,
like
not
over
about
3
months,
or
so.
and
then
there
was
an
amendment
later
on
that
picked
up
this
<agr>
[=
agr]
duty.
justice
stevens
as
originally
drafted,
isn't
it
fair
to
assume
that
congress
thought
these
were
all
short-durational
training
leaves?
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
one
quick
question,
just
to
help
me
out.
in
your
long
footnote
toward
the
end
of
your
brief
where
you
say...
it
ends
up
the
section
would
provide
same
reemployment
rights
as
current
law
provides
following
duty
under
sections
503
through
505.
and
i
could
look
that...
what
do
503
and
505...
do
they
refer
to
active
duty
or
do
they
refer
to
training?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
mr.
hopkins,
this
is
kind
of
a
critical
part
of
the
whole
problem,
as
i
see
it.
your
opponent
argues
that
this
was...
you
started
your
argument
pointing
out
the
agr
program
had
been
created
by
regulations
of
the
army
or
the
department
of
defense.
and...
which
i
take
had
developed
this
concept
of
full-time
service
which
is
now
a
form
of
training
for
2
or
3
years,
like
this
man.
and
they
say
that
this
1980
amendment
was
intended
to
give
protection
to
those
people
who
would
otherwise
been
totally
unprotected
as
i
understand
because
they
weren't
on
active
duty
within
the
meanings
of
the
earlier
subsection,
and
they
weren't
covered
by
(d)
because
that
was
a
short-term
limitation.
in
other
words,
that
this
section
the
1980
amendment
was
specifically
intended
to
pick
up
people
in
this
rather
small
category.
is...
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stevens
well,
this
is
not
an
appropriation
today.
justice
stevens
well,
it
says
for
the
purposes
of
subsection
(c)
and
(d)
of
this
section,
full-time
training
or
other
full-time
duty
performed
by
a
member
of
the
national
guard
under
section...
several
sections,
including
502...
is
considered
active
duty
for
training.
and
that
seems
to
bring
it
within
502(d).
i
mean,
i
still
don't
quite
understand
why...
or
you're
just
saying
well,
this
is
a
mistake.
that
if
you
read
it
literally
it
would
cover
it,
but
it
was
not
intended.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question
a
little
differently.
prior
to
1980,
if
this
amendment
had
not
been
adopted,
and
this
man
had
gone
on
this
3-year
program.
would
he
have
had
any
reemployment
rights
at
all
under
the
statute
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
under
what
section?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no.
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is
a
person
like
this
man
who
accepts
a
3-year
assignment
like
this,
prior
to
1980
amendment,
would
he
have
had
any...
and
it
was
purely
a
training
assignment
as
i
understand
it...
would
he
have
had
any
reemployment
rights
at
all
under
any
provision
of
the
act?
i
don't
think
he
would
have.
justice
stevens
is
it
possible
to
argue,
because
that...
the
1980
amendment
refers
to
both
subsection
(c)
and
(d),
did
they
really
intend
that
he
have
the
rights
that
were
provided
for
under
subsection
(c),
which
would
then
have
a
duration
limit
on
it,
active
duty...
and
refers
to
active
duty.
oh,
that's
if
less
than
12
months.
i
see.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
all
that
about
the
leave
of
absence.
but
i
must
confess
now,
mr.
hopkins,
having
read
the
statute
again,
i'm
not
sure
why
this
man
might
not
have
rights
under
subsection
(c).
and
they
would
then...
he
would
have
to
follow
the
re-employment
procedure,
and
he
would
be
a
person
rather
than
an
employee.
all
the
language
that
you
emphasize
in
your
brief
wouldn't
apply.
justice
stevens
well,
that
relates
to
(d),
but
(c)
contemplates
longer
periods
of
service.
justice
stevens
right.
and
this
person
satisfies
that.
he
has
3
years.
justice
stevens
but
under
(c),
you
wouldn't
have
to
give
any
duty
to
give
him
a
leave
of
absence,
so
your
opinion
would
have
been
absolutely
right.
he's
not
entitled
to
a
leave
of
absence.
but
he
might
have
a
right
to
reemployment
at
the
end
of
the
3-year
period
if
(c)
applies.
justice
stevens
and
then
all
your
language
problems
in
your
brief
seem
to
me
would
be
sound.
or
maybe
there's
an
answer
to
them.
ms.
wax
will
tell
us,
but--
justice
stevens
how
long
is
that
initial
period
typically
for
the
young
person
you're
referring
to?
justice
stevens
and
they
wouldn't
be
covered
if
they'd
been
on
a
weekly
program,
or
one
of
the
regular
programs
of
once
a
month
weekend
duty
and
two
weeks,
so
forth.
and
then
the
following
year
took
a
longer
period,
they
would
be
excluded
because
of
the
word
"initial".
justice
stevens
it
is
initial
in
the
sense
it's
their
first
period
of
duty
of
longer
than
12
weeks.
so
it
may
not
be
their
first
period
of
duty,
but
it's
the
first
period
of
that
duration.
so
you
can
handle
the
word
"initial"
if
that's
the
only
problem.
at
least
i
think
you
can.
justice
stevens
but
it
was
changed
in
1980,
and
you
rely
on
the
1980
amendment.
that
amended
502(c)
as
well
as
(d).
justice
stevens
no,
it's
neither
of
those.
if
you
choose
to
read
the
amendment
in
1980
when
it
says
for
those
purposes
full-time
duty
performed
as
a
member
pursuant
to
these
things
shall
be
considered
active
duty
for
training,
a
concept
that
concludes
initial
active
duty
for
training
as
well
as
subsequent
to
initial
active
duty.
it's
a
question
of
interpreting
the
language
in
the
1980
amendment
which
changes
the
meaning
of
the
two
earlier
statutes.
justice
stevens
well,
it
says
so.
for
the
purposes
of
subsection
(c)
and
(d)
and
to
treat
them
equally.
it
didn't
say
anything
separate
about
(d).
your
brief
only
talked
about
(d),
and
i
didn't
realize
it
until
i
looked
at
it
this
morning,
that
it
applies
equally
to
both.
justice
stevens
the
whole
statute
fits
together
very
nicely
if
you
do
it
that
way,
because
then
(d)
refers
to
training
of
periods
less
than
that
specified
year,
and
(c)
refers
to
those
longer.
and
therefore,
the
longer
ones,
the
man
has
to
reapply.
the
shorter
periods,
he
just
shows
up
for
work
and
says
give
me
my
job
back.
justice
stevens
but
it
was
clearly
interpreted
as...
i
mean,
it
was
understood
obviously
from
the
text
and
the
difference
in
language,
the
original
draftsmen
were
dealing
with
the
problem
of
shorter
periods.
