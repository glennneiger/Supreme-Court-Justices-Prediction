ms.

wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
veteran's
reemployment
rights
act,
which
provides
job
protection
for
members
of
the
armed
forces.
the
question
at
issue
which
arise
under
section
2024(d)
of
the
act,
is
whether
the
right
to
a
leave
of
absence
upon
request
to
perform
active
duty
for
training
is
conditioned
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
request,
or
more
specifically,
on
the
length
of
the
leave
requested.
in
1987,
petitioner,
mr.
william
king,
who
was
employed
as
head
of
security
at
respondent
hospital,
requested
a
leave
of
absence
to
serve
a
3-year
tour
of
full-time
duty
in
the
alabama
national
guard,
as
a
member
of
the
active
guard
reserve
program,
which
provides
full-time
support
personnel
for
armed
forces
reserve
units.
this
request
was
denied
by
the
hospital,
which
filed
this
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
they
were
not
required
to
grant
the
leave.
the
courts
below
held
that
a
request
for
leave
under
section
2024(d)
is
subject
to
a
three-factor
test
of
reasonableness.
in
applying
that
test,
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
length
of
a
leave,
and
ruled
that
a
3-year
leave
was,
per
se,
unreasonable.
in
any
event,
they
held,
petitioner's
request
was
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances,
mainly
because
it
was
too
long.
the
government
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
resolve
a
circuit
split
on
the
issue
of
the
interpretation
of
section
2024(d).
it
is
our
position
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
reasonableness
test
has
no
basis
whatsoever
in
the
statute.
there
simply
is
not
requirement
that
a
request
for
leave
be
reasonable.
once
it
is
established,
and
no
one
contests
in
this
case,
that
section
2024(d)
covers
petitioner's
duty,
and
that
if
he
enjoys
any
re-employment
rights
at
all,
it
is
under
this
section.
the
government
submits
that
the
language
of
<twenty
twenty-four
d@l>
[=
2024(d)]
answers
this
case.
now
on
the
question
of
coverage,
the
district
court
made
the
finding
that
petitioner
received
orders
under
section
502
of
32
u.s.c.
to
perform
full-time
national
guard
duty.
and
section
2024(f)
of
the
reemployment
rights
provision
states
that
full-time
national
guard
duty
under
section
502
is
considered
active
duty
for
training
for
purposes
of
2024(d),
the
provision
at
issue.
that
provision
states
in
pertinent
part
that
an
employee
shall,
upon
request,
be
granted
a
leave
of
absence
by
such
person's
employer
for
the
period
required
to
perform
active
duty
for
training.
the
provision
says
that
the
employee
shall
be
granted
leave.
there
is
no
option
for
the
employer
to
refuse.
the
only
condition
placed
on
the
grant
of
leave
is
that
of
a
request,
a
condition
that
was
complied
with
here.
it's
obvious,
it's
plain,
that
the
word
"reasonable"
no
where
appears
in
this
section.
and
as
for
the
factor
of
which
the
court
made
so
much,
that
of
the
duration
of
leave,
the
provision
obviously
places
no
fixed
limitation
on
how
long
an
individual
can
be
away
from
their
job.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
said
to
address
duration
at
all,
it
states
that
the
employee
is
to
be
granted
a
leave
for
the
period
required
to
perform
the
pertinent
duty.
that
language
makes
clear
that
the
period
of
the
leave
is
just
the
period
required
to
complete
the
training
program
in
which
the
reservist
is
enrolled.
that
requirement,
it
is
assumed,
will
be
fixed
by
statute
or
by
the
military,
whose
job
it
is,
after
all,
to
determine
these
sorts
of
requirements,
and
which
is
traditionally
accorded
a
great
deal
of
deference
in
fixing
training
requirements
in
the
military.
now
in
this
case,
army
regulations
require
3
years
of
service
in
the
agr
program.
and
it
follows
that
petitioner
retains
his
leave
of
absence
status
and
his
right
to
return
to
his
position
for
the
full
3
years.
to
summarize
then,
section
2024(d)
creates
a
flexible,
elastic
protection
that
expands
and
contracts
to
fit
the
requirements
of
a
particular
tour
of
training
duty.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
your
honor,
none.
the
open-ended
language--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
longest
tour
of
duty
that
is
covered
by
this
section
at
this
time
is
the
3-year
agr
program.
in
order
to
be
away
12
years,
he'd
have
to
re-enroll
four
times.
we
are...
the
government
is
aware
of
no
cases
in
which
someone
has
sought
to
return
to
his
job
after
re-enrolling
in
agr
four
times.
what
generally
happens
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
in
the
very
rare
cases
in
which
people
re-enroll
in
agr,
is
that
the
individuals
choose
to
give
up
their
jobs
and
make
a
career
of
this
program.
so
the
theoretical
possibility,
which
we
concede
exists,
because
it
is
possible
to
re-enroll
in
the
agr,
although
it's
totally
at
the
discretion
of
the
military...
an
individual
can't
do
it
on
their
own
motion...
that
theoretical
possibility
hasn't
really
been
a
problem.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
the
individual
will
not
have
the
right
to
come
back
to
his
job
if
the
employer
abolishes
the
position.
and
that
flows
from
several
aspects
of
the
statute.
number
one--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
it
says
that
the
employee
shall
be
permitted
to
return
to
such
employee's
position.
and
it
is
the
department
of
labor's
view
that
the
condition
precedent
to
returning
to
your
position
is
that
the
position
still
exists.
furthermore,
this
flows
from--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
we
think
it's
a
tenable
reading
of
that
language.
and
the
reason
that
it's
more
tenable
than
perhaps
the
alternative,
is
because
2024(d),
and
also
other
sections
contain
what
this
court
has
called
the
escalator
clause,
which
says
that
he
shall...
an
individual
shall
return
with
such
status
and
such
seniority
as
he
would
have
had
had
he
remained
on
the
job.
now,
it's
truism
that
if
someone's
position
is
abolished,
they
would
not
have
had
such
a
job
even
if
they
had
stayed
on
the
job.
and
we
think
that
this
section
manifests
congress'
intent
not
to
make
returning
trainees
better
off
than
they
would
have
been
if
they'd
stayed.
so
the
combination
of
those
two
sections,
we
think,
answers
that
question.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
stated
in
monroe
v.
standard
oil,
that
the
veterans'
reemployment
handbook
is
an
authoritative
source
of
the
interpretation
of
the
act.
we
do
think
that
deference
is
owed,
but
i
think
what
we
would
say
is
that
deference
isn't
needed
here
because
this
is
not
an
issue
in
the
statute
where
there's
any
ambiguity.
there
are
other
issues
in
this
statute
where
there
is
some
question
about
how
it
is
to
be
applied,
and
this
court
has
dealt
with
them
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
cases
that
deal
with
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
an
individual
returns
to
their
job
on
which
the
statute
may
not
be
crystal
clear.
but
the
issue
of
whether
the
person
gets
their
job
back,
we
think
that's
crystal
clear,
and
there
need
be
no
recourse
to
the
veterans'
handbook
on
that
question.
the
open-ended
language--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
is
active
duty
for
training.
active
duty
for
training
is
a
term
of
art,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor,
initial
active-duty
training,
which
by
statute
and
regulation
lasts
90
days
or
less...
30
to
90
days,
that's
covered
by
section
2024(c),
a
separate
provision
of
the
act
which
provide
reemployment
rights
for
initial
active-duty
training.
this
is
something
else
entirely.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
excuse
me,
right,
90
days--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--excuse
me,
3
to
6
months.
that's
my
mistake.
initial
active-duty
training
is
training
that
all
reservists
are
required
to
perform
that
runs
from
3
to
6
months.
so
2024(c)
is
structured
to
apply,
and
is
intended
to
apply
to
that
initial
intensive
period
of
training
that
all
ready
reservists
are
required
to
perform.
all
other
training
duty
is
covered
by
section
2024(d).
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
well,
the
reason
that
this
individual
is
covered
by
2024(d),
your
honor,
is
to
be
found
is
2024(f),
which
specifically
addresses
the
question
of
the
reemployment
rights
of
members
of
the
national
guard
who
serve
on
full-time
duty
under
section
502
of
32
u.s.c.
that's
how
they
get
their
orders.
now,
he
received
his
orders
under
section
502
of
32
u.s.c.
individuals
who
are
serving
so-called
initial
active-duty
training,
which
is
another
term
of
art,
receive
their
orders
under
another
section
of
title
x,
actually,
i
believe.
and
that
is
the
kind
of
training
that
2024(c)
was
meant
to
apply
to.
you're
right
that
this
is
an
initial
tour
of
duty
for
him
of
2024(d)
is
the
provision
that
applies,
by
virtue
of
the
orders
that
he
got...
the
orders
that
he
got,
which
are
under
section
502,
which
is
agr
duty.
the
open-ended
language
of
section
2024(d)
is
to
be
contrasted
with
the
fixed
temporal
limits
to
be
found
in
other
subsections
of
2024,
which
apply
to
reservists
and
others
who
perform
active
duty
in
the
armed
forces.
section
2024(a),
for
example,
which
governs
those
who
enlist
on
active
duty,
provides
at
least
4
years
of
job
protection,
and
in
some
cases,
5.
the
same
applies
to
subsection
(b).
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
well,
the
answer
is
that
the
reason
for
this
disparity
in
features
for
active
duty,
for
training
on
the
one
hand
and
active
duty
on
the
other,
can
be
explained
without
reference
at
all
to
differences
in
duration.
individuals
who
are
on
active
duty
see
combat,
they're
in
harms
way.
they
are
subjected
to...
they
are
essentially
members
of
the
fighting
force.
very
often
they
are.
and
therefore,
congress
could
have
made
the
judgment
that
those
individuals
need
more
protection
in
the
form
of
a
period
to
readjust
to
civilian
life.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--on
the
other
hand,
probably
in
exchange
for
these
greater
protections,
a
post-discharge...
a
post-return
discharge
protection,
a
longer
period
to
reapply,
the
government...
congress
decided
to
give
employers
a
sort
of
quid
pro
quo
of
leeway
to
put
the
person
in
their
old
job
or
in
another
job,
for
example.
and
the
reapplication
process
is
a
way
of
letting
the
employer
decide
whether
he's
going
to
return
them
to
their
old
job
or
an
equivalent
job,
which
is
what
employers
are
committed
to
do
for
individuals
returning
from
active
duty.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
that's
another
answer
to
the
question.
i
think
the
answer
has
two
parts.
one
is
that
duration
is
not
necessarily
the
explanation.
the
other
is
that
congress
may
have
geared--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
at
the
time
it
was
drafted,
the
only
leaves
were
the
short
leaves
which
are
listed
in
the
legislative
history,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
but
congress
drafted
the
statute
in
an
open-ended
way.
it
didn't
put
the
fixed
limits
on
the
statute
that
it
could
have
put,
and
in
fact,
put
in
other
sections
like
2024(a),
(b),
and
(g).
so
our
position
is
that
the
fact
that
certain
short
training
duties...
tours
were
the
only
ones
that
existed
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
doesn't
really
prove
anything
because
congress
did
not
do
what
it
could
have
done,
which
is
simply
to
limit
the
reach
of
2024(d)
and
make
it
an
inflexible
statute,
and
make
it
an
inflexible
provision
that
put
a
ceiling
on
the
leaves,
essentially.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
your
honor.
the
provision
that
was
enacted
in
1960
was
intended
to
cover
reservists,
and
the
reserve
forces
were
manned
by
volunteers.
they
always
have
been
manned
by
volunteers.
so
one
has
to
volunteer
to
be
a
member
of
the
reserve.
the
short
training
duty
that
applied
to
the
reservists,
the
1
weekend
a
month
and
2
weeks
a
year
training
that
existed
in
1960,
that
was
something
that
you
had
to
do
if
you
wanted
to
be
a
member
of
the
reserve.
so
the
fact
that
this
is
voluntary--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
it's
not
required
of
you
in
order
to
be
in
the
reserve,
but
your
honor,
we
don't
think
anything
turns
on
that.
first
of
all,
for
what
it's
worth,
no
court
of
appeals
that
has
looked
at
this,
and
some
of
them
have
actually
looked
at
this
particular
issue,
has
ever
found
it
relevant
on
the
text
of
the
statute,
whether
an
individual
volunteers
or
not.
because
there's
just
no
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two.
but
beyond
that,
we
would
take
the
position
that
this
sort
of
duty
or
other
training
duty
that
might
be
encompassed
by
this
provision
is
in
its
own
way
just
as
vital
to
the
proper
performance
of
the
reserve
forces
as
the
standard
required
training
duty.
i
mean,
if
neither
of
them
existed,
or
if
either
of
them
didn't
exist,
the
reservists
simply
would
not
be
a
ready
fighting
force.
the
training
that
is
now
required
is
just
a
result
of
the
reserve
forces
being
a
far
more
technical
complicated
fighting
force.
now,
the
eleventh
circuit's
ruling
is
not
just
an
untenable
reading
of
the
statute's
terms,
but
it
also
has
untenable
consequences.
usually
when
a
party
comes
before
this
court
and
asks
it
to
disregard
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
it
suggests
or
its
reason
is
that
departing
from
the
plain
language
would
better
serve
the
underlying
purposes
of
this
statute.
but
of
course
here,
the
very
opposite
is
the
case.
first
of
all,
the
eleventh
circuit's
test,
with
its
emphasis
on
duration
and
a
per
se
rule,
would
in
effect
deprive
all
35,000
members
of
the
national
guard
who
serve
in
active
guard
reserve
status
of
any
protection
whatsoever.
they
would
have
no
reemployment
rights
because
they
are
required
to
serve
for
3
years.
and
this
is
particularly
anomalous
in
light
of
the
protections
afforded
to
members
of
the
federal
reserve
components
who
server
in
agr,
those
individuals
are
considered
to
be
on
active
duty
under
title
x,
and
they
are
entitled
to
protection
under
the
provisions
that
apply
to
active
duty,
which
give
at
least
4
years
of
protection.
so
one
would
have
a
situation
in
which
members
of
the
national
guard
who
perform
exactly
the
same
functions
as
federal
reservists
would
have
nothing,
and
the
federal
reservists
would
have
full
protection.
ms.

the
military
the
flexibility
that
it
needs
and
that
time
has
shown
it
needs
to
respond
to
changing
times,
the
demise
of
the
draft,
the
ascending
importance
of
the
reserve
forces,
and
the
concomitant
technological
complications
of
modern
warfare.
so
we
think
that
the
provision
really
is
quite
well
drafted
to
comport
with
changing
times,
so
to
speak.
now
the
features
that
respondent
tries
to
point
to,
which
somehow
are
supposed
to
show
that
this
provision
just
can't
be
applied
to
long-term
duty,
we
don't
think
show
anything
of
the
sort.
for
example,
that
these
people
are
entitled
to
a
leave
of
absence,
a
leave
of
absence
for
a
term
of
years.
well,
the
fact
is
that
it's
possible
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
that
lasts
years.
there
are
individuals
in
our
office
who
have
taken
a
year's
long
leaves
of
absence
to
serve
the
solicitor
general.
it's
possible
to
return
to
your
job
at
the
next
regularly
scheduled
working
period.
i
know
people,
i've
done
it
myself,
who
finish
one
job
on
friday,
travel
to
a
far
city,
and
start
another
job
on
monday.
i
mean,
these
things
certainly
can
be
done.
we
agree
that
congress
may
have
geared
the
provision
overall
to
shorter
periods,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
can't
be
applied
to
longer
periods.
one
doesn't
follow
from
the
other.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
federal
reservists
who
serve
in
the
active
guard
reserve
are
called
under
10
u.s.c.
672(d),
which
governs
active
duty
on
a
voluntary
basis.
that
is
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
footnote
25.
and
those
individuals
receive...
because
they
are
considered
to
be
on
active
duty...
that's
the
classification
that
applies
to
them,
under
10
u.s.c.
in
federal
status,
they
are
covered
by
section
2024(b),
which
gives
reemployment
rights
to
reservists
who
serve
on
active
duty.
the
reason
why
these
two
different
classifications
exist
is
mainly
because
agr
personnel
in
the
national
guard
serve
in
state
status.
in
order
to
serve
in
state
status,
they
have
to
receive
orders
under
section
502.
they're
attached
to
their
state
national
guard
unit.
it's
really
just
a
classification
scheme
that
the
military
has
come
up
with,
but
it
does
have
a
rationale.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct.
the
federal.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
four
years,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
actually,
they
won't
in
practice,
your
honor.
because
congress
created
an
agr
tour
knowing
that
the
agr
tour
was
supposed
to
replace
civilian
military
technicians
who
serve
for
3
years.
and
this
4-year
ceiling
existed
in
the
provision
for
federal
reservists,
so
congress
knew
it
didn't
have
to
worry.
these
people
were
protected
for
a
full
tour.
but
they
also
know
that
the
national
guards
people
didn't
have
to
worry
either
because
2024(d)
didn't
have
any
limitation.
now
if
at
some
future
point
they
create
a
6-year
tour
of
duty,
obviously
the
federal
reservists
have
a
problem,
and
congress
may
have
to
fix
it.
but
given
the
tours
that
existed,
there
was
no
problem
to
fix.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
they're
training...
provisions
that
govern
training
duty
by
national
guards
people,
i
think,
as
far
as
i
recall,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
thank
you.
on
this
issue
of
2024(c)
versus
2024(d),
it
is
true
that
initial
active-duty
training
is
a
term
of
art
and
it's
a
term
of
art
on
an
historical
basis.
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
say
that
in
1955
congress
enacted
the
predecessor
to
2024(c),
which
has
really
not
substantially
changed
since
that
time,
to
protect
reemployment
rights
for
a
period
of
full-time,
intensive,
initial
active-duty
training.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
to
that
extent,
we
are
willing
to
have
this
court
find
that
this
gentleman's
reemployment
rights
are
conferred
by
2024(c).
i
mean,
if
this
court
wants
to
interpret
the
term
"initial"
that
way,
we
certainly
have
no
objection
to
it
from
our
point
of
view.
because
it
would
give
mr.
king
the
coverage
he
needs.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no.
to
be
covered
by
2024(c)
as
opposed
to
(d).
it
has
been
our--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
we
adhere
to
our
position
that
"initial"
is
a
term
of
art
that
refers
to
a
prescribed
period
of
training
that
everyone
has
to
do.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
if
you
choose
to
give
another
meaning
to
the
word
"initial"
we
don't
mind.
[laughter]
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
take
it
that
you
think
that
in
fact
2024(f)
amended
both
(c)
and
(d)
essentially.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
think
that's
one
plausible
interpretation.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
that's
one
plausible
interpretation.
we
don't
want
to
undercut
our
own
position
by
pointing
out
that
(d)
doesn't
say
anything
about
periods
less
than
90
days,
but--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
all
that
existed
at
the
time,
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
true.
well,
we
think
under
justice
stevens'--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
under
justice
stevens'
theory,
he'd
have
relief
under
(c)
or
(d).
as
to
what
happened
in
1980,
we
think
that
even
if
the
statute
before
that
didn't
cover
anything
but
shorter
tours,
the
amendment
in
1980
surely
not
only
expanded
the
category
of
individuals
covered
by
(d)
or
(c)
or
both,
but
also
the
duration.
there's
no
question
about
that
because
it's
for
the
period
required
to
perform
duty.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
thing
about
respondent's
position.
i
confess
to
being
totally
confused
as
to
what
respondent's
position
is.
on
the
one
hand,
he
ties
his
viewpoint
to
the
legislative
history,
the
fact
that
only
certain
prescribed
periods
of
duty
existed
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
up
to
90
days.
on
the
other
hand,
he
endorses
a
free-wheeling
reasonableness
test,
which
has
been
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
permit
leaves
of
absence
for
far
longer
than
90
days.
