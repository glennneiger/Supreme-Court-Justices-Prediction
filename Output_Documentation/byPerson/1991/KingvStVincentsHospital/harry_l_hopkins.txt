mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
particular
point
in
reply,
and
that's
regard
to
the
claim
that
congress
enacted
the
agr
tour.
and
i
have
brought
to
court
today
army
regulation,
a
agr.
it's
an
army
regulation.
and
i
find
no
where
that
it
has
been
adopted
by
congress,
except
perhaps
in
an
appropriations
act.
i
would
like
to
share
with
the
court
a
few
of
the
provisions
in
interpreting
this
statute.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
it
is
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
it's
cited
as
army
regulation
no.
135-18.
it
says,
and
i'm
going
to
be
brief,
a
program
that
offers
career
development
and
upward
mobility
that
encourages
retention.
and
i
recite
that
to
the
court
because
i'm
expected
to
send
my
person
on
a
mandatory
leave
of
absence
under
a
program
that
encourages
retention
by
the
new
employer?
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
i
also
point
this
out
to
you,
that
agr
personnel
will
be
ordered
to
active
duty
or
full-time
duty
for
3
year
periods.
now,
that's
what
we've
stated
the
issue
to
be
here,
and
i'm
the
one
that
drafted
the
letter
denying
the
3
years.
but
the
program
goes
on
to
say
personnel
may
be
extended
at
their
current
duty
station
or
reassigned
at
the
conclusion
of
each
3-year
period,
if
ordered
to
a
subsequent
tour.
and
they
are
stabilized,
which
basically
means
they
can't
be
moved
during
the
first
period,
but
they
can
during
the
subsequent
periods.
i
will
move
on
quickly
to
say
that
it
says
that
there
are
provisions
for
retention
up
to
20
years,
and
it
specifies
the
program...
the
pension
program
that
would
be
eligible.
now
i
submit,
your
honor,
and
i
take
issue
with
the
government,
and
i
think
the
government
misconceives
my
argument
and
misunderstands
it
when
i
say
that
a
leave
of
absence
of
3
years
is
unheard
of.
and
i
am
not
talking
about
the
military.
what
i
am
talking
about
a
labor
council
for
30
years,
that
would
approve
or
negotiate
a
contract
that
would
say
my
employee
in
my
factory
would
be
entitled
to
a
3-year
leave
of
absence.
and
i
say
no,
unequivocally.
now
i
look
to
be
able
to
bring
something
to
the
court
on
that
issue.
leave
of
absence
agreements
are
primarily
private
agreements,
primarily
negotiated,
primarily
in
a
labor
contract,
or
in
at-will
employee
policies.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
precisely.
and
we
have
to
do
it,
your
honor,
also,
as
happened
in
desert
storm.
this
person
has
no
connection
whatsoever
with
desert
storm.
but
i
had
to
do
it
this
time
under
the
other
provisions
for
the
other
people
as
well,
including
the
senior
vice
president
of
the
hospital
went
away
because
he
was
called
away,
ordered
pursuant
to
this
statute.
and
i
suppose
that
another
point
that
would
be
important
to
the
court
in
interpreting
this
difficult
statute,
and
i'm
afraid,
justice
scalia,
i
must
understand
in
the
prior
case
when
you
say
words
don't
mean
anything
anymore.
and
i'm
afraid
i'm
asking
that
they
oftentimes
don't
mean
anything.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
different
meaning,
yes,
justice
kennedy.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
in
1960,
when
this
law
was
passed,
someone...
able,
i
suppose,
legislator...
sat
down
and
they
wrote
out
provisions
for
the
sections
that
were
involved
and
very
carefully
gave
the
inductees
unlimited
rights.
and
i
hope
no
one
claims
that
they
should
not
be
given
virtually
unlimited
rights
in
terms
of
duration.
they
gave
volunteer
persons
a
4-year
limit.
and
they
worked
down
the
statute
with
what
they
had
to
work
with
until
they
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
statute,
and
in
accordance
with
the
universal
military
training
act
that
gives
birth
to
2024(d),
it
provided
initial
duty...
initial
period.
and
that's
when
a
person
went
off,
a
civilian
for
the
first
time,
and
went
off
and
took
a
3
to
6-month
training
program.
no
question
but
what
sky
king
did
that
long
before
this
event
occurred.
once
a
civilian
went
off
and
took
that
initial
training
period,
that
person
had
a
reserve
obligation.
and
justice
souter,
i'll
answer
your
question.
if
you
stay
in
the
reserves,
you
must
satisfy
the
reserve
obligation.
and
usually
the
reserve
obligation
is
to
go
to
drills,
weekend
drills
once
a
month,
and
also
summer
camp.
and
i
would
submit
that
those
are
required.
but
i
also
agree
with
the
government
that
the
voluntary
nature
of
these
programs
in
the
cases
that
have
been
decided,
have
said
that
that's
not
a
proper
point
to
distinguish
these
cases.
if
someone
interpreted
leave
of
absence
and
return
in
terms
of
the
perpich
case,
i
pulled
a
quotation
from
that,
that
the
court
decided
in
1990.
it
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
this
case
except
the
hat
analogy.
and
it
says
basically
these
people
have
three
hats,
they
have
a
state
militia
hat,
and
they
have
a
federal
national
guard
hat,
and
a
civilian
hat.
but
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
authored
those
remarks.
i
would
submit
to
say
that
someone
under
the
agr
program,
the
civilian
hat
would
get
mighty
dusty
if
they
had
a
3-year
leave
of
absence,
perhaps
extended
to
10
to
15
to
20.
a
common
person
writing
this
statute
and
interpreting
it
pursuant
to
1960
standards,
would
automatically
conjure
up
the
idea
that
a
reservist
or
a
national
guard
is
a
part-time
person.
and
if
i
grant
a
leave
to
part-time
person,
that's
one
thing
for
part-time
object
or
policy.
where
i
draw
support,
quite
frankly,
for
the
90-day
limitation,
and
the
way
i
would
interpret
the
statute...
and
i'm
afraid
it's
gotten
beyond
my
ability
to
suggest
an
interpretation,
but
i
would
suggest
that
at
no
time
did
congress
intend
that
the
2024(d)
durational
rights
or
limits
would
exceed
those
of
2024(c),
a
minimum
of
90
days,
a
maximum
usually
of
6
months.
legislative
intent
is
clear.
and
i'll
answer
that
question
in
terms
of
the
reference
to
502,
503,
504,
and
505,
those
are
national
guard
authorization
statutes
that
define
training
of
short
duration.
in
1960,
90
days
would
have
probably
have
been
the
limitation.
it
covers
everything
from
a
2-hour
drill
period
to
a
weekend
drill
period
to
a
school
that
ordinarily
would
last
a
month
or
two.
and
that's
the
way
the
statute
is
structured.
you
look
at
2024(d),
it
talks
about
these
unusual
programs...
they
call
them
active
duty
for
training.
and
then
you
look
at
2024(f)
and
it
says,
oh,
by
the
way,
if
you
want
a
definition
of
that,
you
have
to
look
at
502.
i
would
also
say
in
response
to
a
comment
that
was
made
about
a
later
amendment
from
the
1960
enactment,
and
i
certainly
speak
not
of
the
1974...
recodification,
which
didn't
change
anything.
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
carefully
look,
and
hope
they'll
find
support
for
my
position
that
it
has
not
been
amended.
there
was
an
amendment
in
1980,
in
1980.
the
most
curious
amendment
i
think
i
could
possibly
see
in
the
case.
we
have
two
different
classes.
you've
got
active
duty
for
training
and
inactive
duty
for
training,
both
referenced
in
2024(d).
prior
to
the
amendment,
the
congress
says
you
must
look
at
502,
503,
504,
and
505
to
find
out
what
that
is.
and
at
the
same
time
they're
saying
that
they're
saying
these
are
short-term
programs.
and
then
in
1980,
they
simply
moved
502(f)
from...
they
didn't
move
it
from
inactive,
they
moved
it
to
active
duty,
but
left
it
in
inactive.
did
not
tell
us
anything
about
durational
limitations
or
frequency,
but
simply
a
recognition,
in
my
humble
opinion,
that
there
was
some
active
duty
for
training
or
other
duties
under
502(f).
and
if
the
court
would
please
go
back
to
the
enacting
legislation,
you
will
see
there
is
a
reference
in
that
history
to
summer
camps.
and
the
senate
referred
to
summer
camps
as
active
duty
for
training.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
now,
justice
scalia,
if
words
don't
mean
anything,
the
intent
of
congress
probably
doesn't
mean
anything
in
this
context
because
it
comes
in
so
many
different
direction.
it
comes
in
authorization
acts,
in
an
appropriations
acts.
i'm
talking
about--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--that's
right.
i'm
talking
about
it
does
not
say
anything
in
1980,
about
doing
anything
other
than
recognizing
that
there
is
active
duty
for
training
under
502(f).
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
certainly
there
was
a
recognition
when
502,
or
when
this
1980
amendment
was
made,
that
there
was
active
duty
for
training
under
502(f),
and
also
under
these
other
statutes.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
well,
certainly
under
2024(d),
and
then
the
way
i
interpret
that,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
leave
to
attend
to
summer
camps,
got
to
drills--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--justice
stevens,
i
think
i
understand
that.
there
is
a
question
in
these
cases
about
whether
or
not
this
was
training
or
other
duty.
and
in
1964,
congress
added
the
other
duty
part
to
502(f).
and
i
put
in
my
brief
the
congressional
intent
surrounding
that
enactment.
and
what
i
say
quoting
from
the
senate
reports
in
the
history,
is
that
that
was
designed
to,
for
benefit
purposes,
in
case
someone
had
to
go
on
another
very
short-term
session
to
attend
another
drill
that
same
week.
so
i
suppose
to
get
back,
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
the
question
that
you
propose
because
i
don't
believe
today
this
person
is
entitled
to
this
kind
of
leave...
and
certainly
i
don't
believe
he
was
then.
quite
frankly,
i
see
no
difference
in
this
person
working
for
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
or
the
state
of
alabama
in
the
attorney
general
office.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
recognize
that
there
was
some
active
duty
for
training
under
502(f).
now,
i
maintain
that
since
there
is
not
a
definition
or
description
of
that,
that
it
could
just
as
easily
be
2
weeks'
summer
camp,
a
recognition
of
a
2-week
summer
camp,
as
it
could
be
for
drill
training
which
is
comparably
required
under
503,
or
some
other
very
minimal
short-term
school.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
i
think
there
some
durational
limitations,
and
that's
where
i
draw
the
source
of
my
argument
from
is
the
fact
that
a
2024(c)
does
in
fact
include
those
durational
limitations.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
no.
le--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
that's
my
opinion.
that's
correct.
and
i
would
say
this
in
further
amplification,
the
return
provision...
the
statute
was
written
for
some
person
in
a
factory
and
in
a
law
office,
hanging
up
his
apron,
going
to
summer
camp
or
going
to
summer
drill,
someone
filling
in
temporarily,
while
this
person
was
gone,
and
coming
back
and
taking
his
apron
off
of
that
hook,
putting
it
on
and
resuming
work.
and
the
reason
i
argue
that
it
won't
fit
in
this
case
is
3
years
is
simply
too
long
to
let
the
apron
hang
there.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
and
i
say
that's
a
clear
signal
of
the
intent
that
you
must
interpret
this
statute
with
the
background
of
the
common
meaning
that
reserves
are
part-time
soldiers
and
they're
full-time
workers.
and
we
need
to
strike
that
accommodation.
now,
when
we...
i
have
covered
in
brief
certain
other
amendments,
authorization
and
appropriation
and
definitional
changes,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
they
don't
make
any
difference.
they
don't
amend
or
modify
or
tell
me
or
this
court
that
someone
under
an
agr
program
is
entitled
to
any
leave
of
absence,
much
less
3
years.
it's
just
the
implications
are
that
the
congress--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--your
honor,
in
my
opinion,
to
answer
that
you
would
need
to
read
the
structure
of
intendment
of
the
universal
military
training
act,
where
the
idea
was
so
that
we
could
return
employees
to
the
work
place
to
create
a
system
whereby
we
would
allow
civilians
to
have
an
initial
period
of
training,
and
then
we
would
ask
that
they
participate
in
these
short-term
programs
after
that.
so
i
simply
say
that
it's
clear
in
my
mind--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--contemplates
a
minimum
of
12
weeks.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
i
would
respectfully
say...
and
i
don't
have
the
citation
here
not
anticipating
that
question...
but
i
would
respectfully
say
that
that
concerns
a
person
who
initially
joins
the
reserves
who
is
initially
involved
in
the
reserve
program.
and
that
person
goes
away
for
training
that
lasts
a
minimum
of
12
weeks.
ordinarily
not
over
6
months.
and
that's
the
intendment,
in
my
opinion,
of
(c).
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
in
my
opinion,
this
person
volunteers,
but
he's
then
ordered.
he
receives
orders.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
that's--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--yes.
i
do
not
see
any
basis
at
all.
having
been
involved,
and
we
have
you
know,
i'm
not
going
to
say
he
couldn't
be,
but--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
your
honor,
we
have
toyed
the
issue
questions
2024(d),
and
i'm
here
to
say
that
it
may...
i
would
not
be
troubled
nearly
as
much
if
it
were
2024(c)
as
it
is
2024(d).
but
quite
honestly,
it
doesn't
cover
that
and
the
universal--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
yes.
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
i
know
anything
about
army
regulations,
but
i
think
the
answer--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--quite
honestly,
the
last
time
i
saw
any
orders
was
when
i
was
in
the
korean
conflict,
and
i
hoped
then
that
i
never
saw
another
one.
and
then
i
picked
this
one
up,
and
still
don't
understand
it.
but
in
my
opinion,
2024(c)
would
typically
involve
a
high
school
graduate
that
goes
to
the
reserve
office
and
signs
up
and
goes
off
on
an
initial
period
of
active
duty
for
training.
and
when
that
person,
ordinarily
and
usually
a
young
person,
finishes
that
initial
period,
that
person
then
comes
back
to
the
work
place
and
then
begins
the
drills
and
the
summer
camps.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
it's
typically,
based
on
my
reading,
6
months.
the
statute
protects
down
to
at
least
12
weeks,
but
it's
ordinarily
from
12
weeks
to
6
months
in
duration.
and
i
think
that
ambiguity
will
be
resolved
upon
a
study
of
the
universal
military
training
act,
because
that's
the
scheme
of
things
that
put
all
of
this
together.
and
the
scheme
was
let's
send
these
people,
require
them
initially,
to
take
this
training.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
yes.
in
my
judgment,
and
as
i
report
to
you,
the
word--
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
--well,
i
would
simply
say
that
i
read
"initial"
in
the
sense
that
i
think
it
was
intended.
and
i
would
not
be
troubled
under
my
situation
if
it
were
applicable,
because
i
would
not
have
to
hold
this
job
for
this
person.
i
would
not
have
to
insist
that
he
come
back
at
the
next
shift
and
take
his
apron
after
such
an
extended
period
of
time.
mr.
harry
l.
hopkins
i
would
also
like
to
speak
to
the
guidance
that
the
government
claims
should
come
from
the
handbook.
and
i
would
like
to
cite
to
the
court,
justice
o'connor
has
already
alluded
to
the
change
in
the
handbook,
and
the
government
has
cited
another
case.
i
would
like
to
cite
what
i
think
are
the
principal
case
of
skidmore.
and
the
skidmore
case
says
that...
certainly
use
it
as
guidance
if
it
is
guidance...
the
reviewing
courts
should
not
blindly
defer
to
agency
interpretation,
and
the
amount
of
deference
warranted
in
a
particular
case
will
depend
upon
a
thoroughness
evident
in
it's
consideration,
the
validity
of
its
reading...
reasoning,
its
consistency
with
earlier
and
later
pronouncements,
and
all
those
factors
which
give
it
power
to
persuade
if
lacking
power
to
control.
and
i
would
say
that
one
of
the
arguments
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
a
compromise
agreement.
i
suppose
that
at
some
point...
well,
i
know
at
some
point
in
the
history
of
the
development
there
were
some
statutes,
or
it's
court
decisions
that
suggested
that
perhaps
there
is
a
90-day
limitation
on
this
point.
so
in
montgomery,
congressman
montgomery
passed
a
house
bill
that
says
instead
of...
he
doesn't
allude
to
the
agr
and
all
this
expansive
period,
he
says
let's
give
a
reserve
person,
or
a
national
guard
person
a
total
of
1
year
out
of
3.
and
that
did
not
pass
the
senate.
