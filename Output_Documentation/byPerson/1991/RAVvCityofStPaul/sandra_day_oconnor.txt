justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cleary,
in
reading
your
briefs,
it
appeared
to
me
that
you
were
arguing
a
case
other
than
the
one
presented,
which
i
thought
involved
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
agree
at
this
point
that
we
are
looking
at
the
statute
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
interpreted
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
as
it
could
theoretically
have
been
interpreted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
essence
what
the
minnesota
supreme
court
appears
to
have
said
is,
we
interpret
the
law
as
reaching
only
those
exceptions
that
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
to
the
first
amendment...
fighting
words,
for
instance,
out
of
our
prior
chaplinsky
case.
now,
do
you
agree
that
that's
what
they've
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
in
essence
they
said
what
that
statute
means
is
what
the
supreme
court
has
permitted
in
brandenburg
and
chaplinsky.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
thought
that
the
minnesota
court
recognized
that
the
minnesota
statute
reaches
only
what
was
said
in
chaplinsky
could
survive
and
in
brandenburg
what
survived,
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
would
ask
us
to
somehow
overturn
those
older
holdings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
say
it's
underinclusive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
foley,
would
you
address
the
concern
expressed
by
your
opponent
that
the
ordinance
is
limited
to
only
fighting
words
that
arouse
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
or
religion
or
gender
and
not
other
fighting
words
that
could
cause
the
same
reaction
in
people?
the
argument
is
that
the
statute
is
underinclusive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
it
is
limited
by
subject
matter
or
content
of
the
fighting
words
that
are
spoken,
is
it
not?
in
that
sense
it
is
a
content-based
ordinance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
doesn't
cover
fighting
words
that
are
not
limited
to
words
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why,
i
mean,
how
can
you
possibly
say
it
isn't
content-based
to
that
extent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
foley,
i
would
have
thought
you
might
respond
to
justice
scalia's
question
by
citing
new
york
against
ferber
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
language
is
unprotected
by
the
constitution
as
you
assert
is
the
case
here,
then
underinclusiveness
just
doesn't
apply.
the
state
can
single
out
what
it
wants,
at
least
that's
what
the
court
said
in
that
case.
do
you
rely
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
that
other
ordinance,
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
the
citation?
will
you
furnish
it
later
so
we
don't
use
up
your
last
minute?
