rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
90-7675,
r.a.v.
v.
st.
paul,
minnesota.
mr.
cleary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cleary,
isn't
one
of
your
complaints
that
the
minnesota
statute
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
punishes
only
some
fighting
words
and
not
others?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
understand
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
to
have
decided
one
way
or
another
whether
the
conduct
of
this
particular
petitioner
is
included
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
left
that
presumably
for
the
state
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
court's
opinion
in
texas
against
johnson
suggested
that
there
couldn't
be
a
fighting
symbol
at
any
rate,
per
se,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cleary.
mr.
foley,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
foley,
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
in
its
opinion
did
not
decide
whether
the
conduct
with
which
r.a.v.
was
charged
came
under
the
ordinance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
and
he
disagree
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
foley.
mr.
cleary,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--were
there
differences
in
penalties
under
one
or
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
exactly
the
same--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cleary.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-7675,
r.a.v.
versus
st.
paul,
minnesota
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
