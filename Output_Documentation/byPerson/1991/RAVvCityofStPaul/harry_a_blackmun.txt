mr.
cleary,
do
you
think
that
chaplinsky
was
wrongly
decided?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
it
was
written
on
behalf
of
the
court
by
one
of
the
great
liberals
of
the
country.
it
always
amused
me
that
chief
justice
stone
assigned
it
to
frank
murphy
to
write.
but
you
feel
it
can
still
stand
as
good
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
have
you
had
anymore
cross
burnings
in
st.
paul
since
this
incident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
certainly
would
be
publicity--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
foley,
before
you
get
started,
let
me
ask
a
couple
of
trivial
questions.
you
are
the
county
attorney,
aren't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
the
city
is
the
respondent
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
is
why
the
city
is
a
party
to
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
as
well
as
being
the
respondent
in
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
a
little
unusual,
i
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
one
other
trivial
question.
the
cross
burning
took
place
on
earl
street,
didn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whereabouts
on
earl
street?
that
is
a
long
street,
it
runs
from
mounds
park
to
finland
park.
[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
hm?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
that,
but
where
is
290?
what
is
the
cross
street?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
know--
[laughter]
it
is
near
mounds
park
or
is
it
near
finland
park?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
was
up
there
last
june
with
some
u.s.
marshals
who
had
never
been
there.
and
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
beautiful
views
in
the
city
of
st.
paul.
but
the
grass
was
so
high
you
couldn't
see
the
view.
have
your
maintenance
man
cut
the
grass.
[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
foley,
does
the
fact
of
the
burning
of
the
cross
on
the
lawn
of
the
jones
family
have
any
bearing
here?
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you,
but
i
take
it
in
your
approach
it
doesn't
have
any
great
bearing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
the
burning
were
done
in
front
of
the
ramsey
county
courthouse
at
wabasha
and
kellogg
boulevard?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
in
a
different
situation,
around
the
plaza
of
the
state
capitol?
