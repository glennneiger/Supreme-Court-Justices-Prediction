mr.
edward
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
each
generation
must
reaffirm
the
guarantee
of
the
first
amendment
with
the
hard
cases.
the
framers
understood
the
dangers
of
orthodoxy
and
standardized
thought
and
chose
liberty.
we
are
once
again
faced
with
a
case
that
will
demonstrate
whether
or
not
there
is
room
for
the
freedom
for
the
thought
that
we
hate,
whether
there
is
room
for
the
eternal
vigilance
necessary
for
the
opinions
that
we
loathe.
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
reprehensible,
is
abhorrent,
and
is
well-known
by
now.
i'm
not
here
to
defend
the
alleged
conduct,
but
as
justice
frankfurter
said
40
years
ago,
history
has
shown
that
the
safeguards
of
liberty
are
generally
forged
in
cases
involving
not
very
nice
people.
he
might
just
as
well
have
well
said,
involving
cases
involving
very
ugly
fact
situations.
i
am
here
to
discuss
and
to
ask
the
court
to
review
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
a
st.
paul
ordinance.
justice--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i
did
go
into
great--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--yes.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
yes.
the
reason
i
went
into
as
much
detail
as
i
did
with
the
ordinance
as
written
was
to
show
the
distance
from
a
to
b
and
the
attempt
to
narrowly
construe
that
law.
we
have
to
acknowledge
the
state
has
a
right
under
federal
statute
to
construe
their
laws.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
agree
that
the
court
attempted
to
narrow
the
ordinance
and
in
doing
so
cited
chaplinsky
and
brandenburg
to
this
court.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
they
did
cite
those
cases,
your
honor.
i
do
believe,
however,
that
the
expansive
language
that
was
used
shows
a
much
broader
reach
than
what
this
court
indicated
in
those
cases.
in
discussing
chaplinsky
they
cite
several
times
the
afflict
injury
dictum
from
that
case.
that
took
a
standard
that
was
very
close
to
an
offensiveness
standard
and
raises
the
adverse
emotional
harm
idea
from
the
hustler
magazine
case
in
that
the
outrageousness
standard
is
raised,
and
it
really
opens
a
hole
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
would
still
object
to
the
ordinance
as
construed,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
do
that,
your
honor,
to
get
to
the
position
that
i'm
requesting.
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
the
court
cited
chaplinsky
and
brandenburg,
the
lower
court,
but
in
doing
so
in
brandenburg,
for
instance,
they
refer
to
the
provocative
standard,
and
the
government
may
censor
provocative
conduct,
and
it
does
so
in
a
manner
where
it
cites
the
likely
to
incite
imminent
lawless
action
as
opposed
to
the
likely
to
and
directed
to,
and
i
think
the
real
significance
of
that
is
that
you
could
have
a
hostile
audience
censor
the
expression.
i
believe
that
brandenburg
was
written
in
terms
of
a
sympathetic
audience,
and
i
believe
you
get
into
the
heckler's
veto
problem
if
you
allow
that
type
of
interpretation,
and
the
language
of
that
opinion,
combined
with
the
language
of
the
ordinance
as
originally
written,
really
leaves
that
open
as
a
possibility...
as
a
significant
possibility,
combined
with
the
injury
language
from
chaplinsky.
the
problem
is
that
the
language
is
so
broad
that
it
leaves
open
the
possibility
of
an
outrageousness
standard,
a
dignity
standard
as
imposed,
and
just
generally
an
offensiveness
standard,
and
that
is--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--from
this
court's
opinions,
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
limited
to
those
words
that
bring
on
an
immediate
breach
of
peace,
the
reflexive
violence
idea.
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
construed,
nor
did
the
new
hampshire
court
originally
construe,
the
inflict
injury
dictum
as
part
of
that
holding.
i
believe
the
court
has
limited
that
to
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
type
of
cases.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
so
in
terms
of
a
viewpoint-neutral
type
of
law
that
may
address
the
content
of
what
you're
referring
to
but
would
do
so
in
terms
of
immediate
breach
of
peace,
or
would
do
so
in
terms
of
another
law
such
as
a
threat
law,
a
terrorist
or
threat
law
which
i
think
would
be
permissible
and
even
fit
the
alleged
fact
situation
in
this
case.
i
don't
mean
to
downplay
the
victims...
in
this
case,
for
instance,
certainly
in
the
fact
situation
there
were
laws
available
to
the
state,
significant
and
hard
and
tough
laws,
to
deal
with
an
ugly
fact
situation.
instead,
they
chose
a
law
that's
not
as
serious,
that
addresses
and
attempts
to
address
expression
and
the
content
of
that
expression
with
interest
in
its
communicative
impact,
which
is
a
totally
different
type
of--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
my
positions,
that
in
doing
so,
even
though
it
is
a
subcategory,
technically,
of
unprotected
conduct,
it
still
is
picking
out
an
opinion,
a
disfavored
message,
and
making
that
clear
through
the
state.
it's
a
paternalistic
idea,
and
the
problem
that
we
have
is
that
the
government
must
not
betray
neutrality,
and
i
believe
it
does,
even
when
it
picks
out
a
subcategory.
with
the
first
amendment,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
if
you
punish
the
greater
you
can
punish
the
lesser.
if
we
had
a
law
that
banned
the
posting
of
signs,
for
instance,
somewhat
akin
to
vincent,
and
if
we
had
in
there
including
but
not
limited
to
signs
regarding
the
democratic
party
symbols,
now
that
might
be
a
mere
example,
and
it
might
be
a
subcategory,
but
i
believe
this
court
would
be
offended
by
that.
i
believe
the
court
would
feel
that
that
was
betraying
sympathy
or
hostility
to
a
political
viewpoint,
and
i
believe
the
same
principle
is
in
course
here,
because
i
think
the
problem
we
have
is
that
we
have...
regardless
of
whether
those
symbols
are
mere
examples,
we
have
the
possibility,
the
real
possibility,
that
we
have
a
government
signaling
its
disagreement
with
the
particular
type
of
opinion.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
i
did
not
decide...
i
did
not
see
their
opinion
as
directly
deciding
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
was
included.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that...
this
is
significant
to
justice
o'connor's
point,
too.
i
did
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
the
briefing
on
the--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i'm
sorry,
justice.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
it
has
not
gone
back
for
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
thought
you
asked
whether
it
was
tried.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
it
was
an
overbreadth
challenge
and
i
think
what
they
were
saying
was
that
the
ordinance
itself
was
constitutional
after
the
narrow
construction,
but
i--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--they
did.
they
handled
that
in
a
different
fashion
than
they
handled
this
case.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
they
left
open
how
the
ordinance,
once
narrowly
construed,
would
affect
this
alleged
conduct,
yes.
i
think
certainly
the
reasoning
of
the
opinion
is
such
that
they
are--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--if
you've
been
charged
with
an
offense--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
well,
what
i
said
was,
the
respondent's
position
is
that
these
were
mere
examples
and
that
there
was
not
a
viewpoint
selected
and
discriminated
against.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
well,
i
am...
i
am
suggesting
that's
not
true.
i'm
simply
suggesting
the
worst-case
scenario,
that
if
the
court
were
to
believe
that
they
were
mere
examples,
that
there's
still
problems
with
the
narrow
construction
in
that
it
does
not
address
speech
that
would
not
be...
that
would
either
be
tolerant
or
would
be
intolerant
in
other
areas,
and
in
that
sense
it's
betraying
a
viewpoint
from
the
government
that
is
no
longer
neutral.
they're
picking
out
certain
categories
in
that
sense.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--well,
i'm
not
suggesting
the
court
need
overrule
chaplinsky,
which
talks
about
immediate
breach
of
peace,
and
those
would
not
necessarily
have
to
be
threatening
words.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
when
you
get
into
an
offensiveness
standard--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i
think
the
court
was
talking
about
two
separate
categories.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that...
i'll
be
very
honest.
i
think
that's
a
very
hard
line
to
draw,
and
i
think
that's
perhaps
the
crux
of
this
case
to
a
certain
degree,
is
the
offensiveness
idea
and
how--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
court
must
draw
the
line
in
favor
of
the
individual
right
of
self-expression.
i
think
that
if
the
line--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i
am.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
the
debate
in
this
case
is
not
about
the
wisdom
of
eradicating
intolerance,
the
debate
is
about
the
method
of
reaching
that
goal.
i
believe
that
the
city
council
officials
in
this
case
and
in
other
communities
are
very
well-meaning,
and
that's
usually
the
case,
but
the
problem
is
that
i
believe
these
type
of
laws
cross
the
line
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
duty
of
the
state
to
not
participate
in
any
racist
state
action
or
any
intolerant
state
action,
in
that
sense,
with
the
first
amendment
right
of
self-expression,
even
if
it
be
intolerant,
provided
it
does
not
cross
the
line
of
illegal
conduct
itself.
i
believe
the
danger
in
a
law
like
this
is
that
it
does
pick
out
viewpoints,
that
it
is
viewpoint-discriminatory,
and
that
there's
nothing
to
stop
another
state
from
taking
a
law
just
like
this,
having
a
different
symbol
such
as...
and
it
uses
the
example
in
the
briefs
of
the
star
of
david...
and
suggesting
that
you
can
narrowly
construe
that
to
fighting
words,
that
leaving
that
open
to
the
law
enforcement
officials,
it's
not
only
vague--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
chaplinsky
has
to
be
overruled.
i
believe
the
immediate
breach
of
peace
language
is
still
active,
i
believe
there's
been
a
lot
of
confusion
over
the
injury
language.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
to
be
overruled
to
reverse
this
decision,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
inflict
injury
and
the
brandenburg
misconstruction
is
more
important
in
terms
of
this
opinion.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
chaplinsky
is
no
longer
good
law
in
terms
of
the
immediate
breach
of
peace
standard.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
if
the
court...
the
court
has
spent
50
years
redefining
the
lines
of
chaplinsky.
the
immediate
breach
of
peace
language,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
only
language
that
has
really
been
construed
because
that
is
what
new
hampshire
construed.
i
believe
the
reflexive
violence
theory
of
it
perhaps
is
not
as
strong
now
as
it
was
50
years
ago,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
that
the
court
need
not
overrule
that
type
of
thinking
to
get
to
this
opinion
and
this
decision.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
think
the
theory
of
chaplinsky
is
a
hostile
audience
idea
as
opposed
to
brandenburg.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
yes,
i
believe
so.
but
i
believe
the
state
is--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--it's
constitutional
in
the
sense
that
immediate
breach
of
peace
is
still
good
law
under
chaplinsky,
yes.
but
it's
my
position
that
the
balance
of
the
language
in
the
opinion
leads
to
a
vagueness
which
under
kolender
is
much
more
serious
in
terms
of
selective
and
discriminatory
law
enforcement.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
believe
it
could.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
believe
it
could.
i
believe,
i
have
never
argued
that...
again,
that
the
conduct
alleged
in
this
case
could
not
be
addressed
by
viewpoint-neutral
laws,
but
this
type
of
a
law
leaves
open
the
possibility
for
viewpoint
discrimination,
and
it
opens
up,
again,
the
selective
enforcement
idea.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
do,
your
honor,
in
the
sense,
not
necessarily
exactly
like
erznoznik,
but
in
the
sense
that
it
definitely
picks
and
betrays
government
neutrality.
i
think
the
government
must
be
neutral
when
they
go
about
compiling
laws
or
construing
laws
that
may
effect
first
amendment
rights.
certainly
in
this
current
time
there
is
a
great
deal
of
fear,
and
that
first
amendment...
and
as
it
is
construed
and
as
it
is
before
this
court
has
to
face
the
environment
that
we
find
ourselves
in
as
a
nation.
justice
brandeis
once
said
that
fear
breeds
repression
and
repression
breeds
hate.
i
believe
that
this
is
the
hour
of
danger
for
the
first
amendment
in
that
there
are
many
groups
that
would
like
to
encroach
upon
its
principles
with
well-meaning
intentions,
but
in
doing
so,
they
are
still
punishing
the
content
of
the
communication
and
they
are
doing
so
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
and
the
government
is
betraying
a
neutral
principle
in
the
sense
that
they
are
allowing
that
to
happen
and
they
are
partaking
in
that.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
that
is
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
think
it...
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no,
but
it
does
rely
on
audience
reaction,
the
idea
of
chaplinsky
does
rely
on
audience
reaction,
the
reflexive
violence
idea,
and
everyone
is
going
to
be
different,
but
that
kind
of
runs
right
into
what
i
am
referring
to
on
the
injury
idea.
what
if
someone
injured
offensively--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--in
terms
of
the
immediate
breach
of
peace,
it
might
be.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
agree--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--no,
except
that
i
think
it
has
been
a
case-by-case
adjudication
for
50
years
under
chaplinsky
in
terms
of
the
immediate
breach
of
peace
and
getting
into
a
reasonable
man
standard
on
immediate
breach
of
peace
i
think
would
be
much
easier
to
litigate
than
the
inflict
injury
because
i
think
the
inflict
injury
brings
us
back
to
the
boos
v.
barry
and
hustler
magazine
idea,
that
political
discourse
involves
outrageousness,
and
these
are
the
some
of
the
major
issues
of
our
day
and
there
are
going
to
be
intolerant
opinions
displayed.
and
the
question--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i
am
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
that
doesn't
mean
there
haven't
been
any,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
think
there
would
in
st.
paul,
your
honor.
the
possibility,
as
justice
scalia
has
indicated
earlier,
for
the
application
of
this
ordinance
to
all
kinds
of
opinions
is
clear.
we
have
again
the
most,
perhaps
the
most
hateful
example
that
could
come
under
this
type
of
a
law,
but
we
are
left
with
all
the
other
political
discourse
and
debate
that
could
fall
under
its
parameters,
and
that
is
the
danger
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
opinion.
it
leaves
that
possibility
wide
open.
it
even
talks
about
hate
symbols
at
one
point
as
not
being
totally
banned
and
then
in
another
point
indicates,
very
close
to
indicating
that
they
are
fighting
words
per
se,
that
swastikas
and
burning
crosses
are
always
symbols
of
hatred
communities
have
the
obligation
to
confront.
that
reads
very
closely
as
being
a
ban
in
my
view.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
the
symbols
themselves?
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
agree.
i
don't
think
that
fighting
words,
per
se,
would
ever
work.
i
think
that
that
would
really
involve
a
censoring
of
expression
and
that
would--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i
think
the
tension,
justice
scalia
is
between
the
first
amendment
right
of
expression
and
the--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--i
think
the
danger
in
that
is
that
it
could
lead
to
a
total
ban
of
language
or
of
symbols
or
other
expression
that
any
community
would
call
fighting
words
per
se.
i
think
when
you
get--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--that's
correct,
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
court's
holding
in
texas
v.
johnson
supports
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case,
and
i
also
would
point
out
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
dissents
are
necessarily
inconsistent
with
the
petitioner's
position
on
this
law.
i
would
say
that
is
particularly
true
because
of
the
fact
that
this
court
put
a
great
emphasis
on
the
unique
nature
of
the
american
flag
and
in
doing
so,
i
believe
acknowledged
the
stromberg
red
flag
of
the
'30's,
the
black
armband
in
the
'60's,
a
tinker,
and
was
mindful
of
the
fact
that
once
that
door
is
opened,
that
it
could
lead
to
a
ban
on
symbolic
behavior
in
such
a
fashion
that
a
great
deal
of
expression
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
describing
a
threat,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
think
it
is
pursuant
to
a
viewpoint-neutral
law
in
terms
of
a
decision
as
to
whether
there
is
an
intent
to
threaten.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
believe
that
there
would
need
to
be
a
finding
of
intent
to
threaten
and
so
therefore
that
would
be
one
of
the
considerations
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
imminent
or
not.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
it
is
hard
to
draw
the
line
on--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--there
is
certainly
communication
and
it
certainly
could
be
considered
a
threat,
and
i
believe
a
prosecution
pursuant
to
a
viewpoint-neutral
law
such
as
terroristic
threats
might
address
that,
but
i
don't
believe
this
law
either
as
written
or
narrowly
construed
would
be
the
law
to
address
that.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
thank
you,
chief
justice.
in
reference
to
justice
white's
and
justice
o'connor's
observations,
this
is
lewis,
this
is
not
ferber.
this
is
not
marginal
effects
on
the
first
amendment
expression.
this
is
a
huge
hole
and
i
believe
it
really
represses
a
great
deal
of
expressive
conduct,
much
more
so
than
the
marginal
impact
of
ferber.
mr.
foley
mentions
in
relation
to
justice
scalia's
question
concerning
the
underinclusiveness,
there
was
a
content-neutral
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
available
that
did
not...
underinclusive,
fighting
words.
more
importantly
perhaps,
since
mr.
foley
spends
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
the
terroristic
factual
allegations
here,
there
were
other
more
serious
laws
available
that
didn't
make
this
kind
of
a
political
statement.
this
is
not
a
question
about
whether
anyone
here
approves
of
this
alleged
conduct.
there
were
tough
ways
of
dealing
with
it
without
implicating
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
the
s.l.j.
was--
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
--s.l.j.
was
narrowly
construed
by
the
minnesota
court
to
read,
just
fighting
words
without
any
subgroups
or
any
of
the
rest
of
this
language.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
i
am
saying...
the
other
ordinance
would
implicate
the
first
amendment
but
not
in
terms
of
the
viewpoint
neutrality
and
not
in
terms
of
the
under
inclusiveness.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
it's
cited
in
the
briefs,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
no.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
they
are
both
misdemeanors.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
excuse
me,
it
was
a
statute.
the
penalty
was
the
same,
however.
they
are
both
90
days
maximum.
mr.
edward
j.
cleary
certainly,
your
honor.
in
closing,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
this,
that
it
would
be
a
sad
irony
if
we
diminished
the
first
amendment
right
of
free
expression
to
american
citizens
in
this
way
when
the
countries
of
eastern
europe
and
the
baltic
states
and
the
soviet
bloc
are
returning
their
liberties
to
their
citizens.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
minnesota
supreme
court
decision
to
remand
this
case
for
trial
on
the
remaining
charge.
thank
you.
