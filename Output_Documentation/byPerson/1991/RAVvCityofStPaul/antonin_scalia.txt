justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cleary,
i
don't
understand
the
comments
you
made
earlier
in
response
to
the
chief
justice.
you
seem
to
concede
that
the
statute
here
merely
gives...
or
could
be
interpreted
to
be
giving
just
some
examples
of
a
general
prohibition.
how
can
it
be
read
that
way?
i
mean,
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
ordinance
only
considers
disorderly
conduct
the
placing
on
public
or
private
property
of
a
symbol,
object,
et
cetera,
which
one
knows
or
has
reasonable
grounds
to
know
arouses
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
in
others,
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender?
now,
that's
selective,
isn't
it?
aren't
there
a
lot
of
other
reasons
why
anger
might
be
aroused?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
why
do
you
have
any
doubt
about
whether
it's
just
giving
examples?
i
mean,
it
does
give
the
examples
of
burning
a
cross
or
a
nazi
swastika,
but
in
fact
the
text
of
the
ordinance
is
limited
to
causing
alarm
or
resentment
for
only
certain
reasons,
and
if
you
cause
alarm
or
resentment
for
other
reasons,
that
is
not
unlawful
under
the
ordinance,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
i
thought
you
said,
even
if
that
is
so,
and
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
contradicting
that
categorically.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cleary,
going
back
to
what
justice
kennedy
was
asking
about,
the
fighting
words
doctrine,
it
depends
case
by
case
on
the
reaction
of
the
person
who
hears
the
words,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
use
any
language
whatever
in
a
quaker
community,
if
you
are
in
a
solid
quaker
community,
you
can
be
much
more
insulting
than
you
can
somewhere
else.
does
that
make
a
lot
of
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
make
a
lot
of
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
might
it
not
be
a
reasonable
man
standard?
i
guess
you
could
have
to
consider
quakers
not
reasonable
men,
at
least
insofar
as
their
strong
aversion
to
violence
is
concerned,
but
might
not
that
be
the
standard
for
the
fighting
words
doctrine?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
mean,
if
you
happen
to
be
in
a
pacifistic
community,
why
should
the
law
take
that
into
account,
why
should
the
law
subject
these
people
to
that
kind
of
abuse
which
other
people
would
be
provoked
to
respond
to
with
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
depend
on
the
particular
people
to
whom
the
words
are
addressed.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
think
they
can't
be
fighting
words
per
se?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fighting
word
per
se,
you
always...
this
is
going
back
to
our
prior
discussion.
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
quakers
have
no
protection
or
the
peaceful
family
that
would
not
punch
out
someone
who
waved
a
swastika
in
their
face,
that's
their
misfortune,
that
they
are
so
law-abiding
as
not
to
be
violent,
and
therefore,
what
would
otherwise
be
fighting
words
can
be
used
against
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
that
is
the
tension,
but
why
is
it
that
there
can't
be
such
a
thing
as
a
fighting
word
per
se,
a
kind
of
a
word
that
would
be
likely
to
provoke
a
violent
reaction
from
an
ordinary
person.
whether
this
person
or
this
crowd
in
particular
would
be
violent
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
foley,
if
you're
going
to
make
all
these
concessions
you
might
as
well
sit
down
now.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
mr.
foley,
suppose
you,
the
other
major
area
of
speech
that
we
have
called
nonspeech,
i
guess
it's
just
a
matter
of
analysis,
but
we
call
it
obscenity,
not
speech,
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now
i
assume
that
it
would
be
bad,
would
it
not,
to
have
an
ordinance
that
says
you
cannot
use
obscene
photographs
to
advertise...
i
don't
know,
the
republican
party.
[laughter]
you
may
not
use
obscenity
for
the
following
purposes,
and
then
picking
very
content-based
purposes
for
advertising
the
republican
party,
this
cause,
the
other
cause.
that
would
be
bad,
wouldn't
it,
even
though
you're
dealing
with
unprotected
speech.
if
you
want
to
prohibit
obscenity,
prohibit
obscenity.
so
it's
the
same
here,
if
you
want
to
prohibit
fighting
words,
prohibit
fighting
words.
but
why
pick
only
if
you
use
fighting
words
for
these
particular
purposes,
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
and
gender?
what
about
other
fighting
words?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
political
judgment.
i
mean,
you
may
feel
strongest
about
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender.
somebody
else
may
feel
strong
as
to
about
philosophy,
about
economic
philosophy,
about
whatever.
you
picked
out
five
reasons
for
causing
somebody
to
breach
the
peace.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ones.
what's
your
basis
for
making
that
subjective
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
add
anything.
you
could
just
drop
the
words
and,
you
know,
just
say
that
arouses
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
in
others,
period,
or
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
it
didn't
have
to
say
arouses
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender.
you
don't
need
that
for
chaplinsky.
if
it's
a
fighting
word,
it's
a
fighting
word.
they
could
get
the
cross
burning,
they
could
get
all
sorts
of
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
bias-motivated,
but
it
depends
on
what
your
biases
are.
if
a
family
with
a
mentally
deficient
child
should
move
into
the
neighborhood
or
if
there
should
be
established
in
the
neighborhood
a
home
for
the
mentally
ill,
and
someone
should
burn
a
cross
on
the
lawn
of
that
home
or
institution
with
a
sign
that
says,
mentally
ill
out,
that
would
not
be
covered
by
this
ordinance,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
wrong
kind
of
bias.
it's...
at
least
until
they
come
around
to
adding...
which
may
well
be
the
next
one,
gender,
religion,
gender
or
disability,
until
they
come
around
to
adding
that,
it's
the
wrong
kind
of
bias
and
therefore
you
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that?
i
mean,
if
you
are
concerned
about
breaches
of
the
public
peace,
if
it's
a
fighting
words
problem,
why
is
it
okay
for
the
state
to
have
the
public
peace
broken
for
that
reason?
it's
only
these
other
reasons
they
are
worried
about,
why
is
that?
that
seems
to
me
like
the
rankest
kind
of
subject
matter
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
hard,
it
wasn't
hard
to
write
this
in
such
a
way
that
it
wouldn't
discriminate
in
that
fashion.
they
just
had
to
drop
out,
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
religion
or
gender,
but
those
are
the
only
things
that
they
seemed
to
be
concerned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
there
was
another
general
breach
of
the
peace
ordinance
that
could
have
covered
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
general
breach
of
peace
ordinance
that
would
have
covered
fighting
words?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
fighting
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
you
could
say
that
the
municipality's
law
as
a
whole
did
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
subject
matter?
i
mean,
under
this
particular
ordinance
you
can
only
get
certain
types
of
fighting
words,
but
you
are
saying
under
another
ordinance
you
could
get
the
rest.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
just
about
two
years
ago
in
the
predawn
hours
of
june
21,
1990,
the
petitioner,
r.a.v.
a
juvenile
and
several
other
teenagers,
allegedly
assembled
a
crudely
made
cross
by
taping
together
broken
chair
legs.
they
then
allegedly
burned
the
cross
inside
the
fenced
yard
of
a
black
family
that
lived
across
the
street
from
the
house
where
petitioner
was
staying.
although
this
conduct
could
have
been
punished
under
any
of
a
number
of
laws
carrying
significant
penalties.
one
of
the
two
provisions
under
which
the
respondent,
city
of
st.
paul,
chose
to
charge
petitioner
was
the
st.
paul
bias-motivated
crime
ordinance
which
prohibits
the
display
of
a
symbol
which
one
knows
or
has
reason
to
know
"arouses
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
in
other
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender".
the
trial
court
dismissed
this
charge
on
the
ground
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
first
amendment
because
it
was
substantially
over
broad
and
impermissibly
content-based.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
reversed
thereby,
upholding
the
ordinance.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
this
court
is
bound
by
the
state
court's
construction
of
the
ordinance
as
reaching
only
expressions
constituting
fighting
words,
a
category
of
expression
that
we
have
previously
held
to
be
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
r.a.v.
urges
us
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
fighting
words
doctrine
contained
in
our
cases
thereby,
invalidating
the
ordinance
as
substantially
over
broad.
but
we
need
not
reach
that
issue.
we
conclude
that
the
ordinance
is
facially
unconstitutional
because
it
prohibits
speech
on
the
basis
of
the
subjects
the
speech
addresses.
the
first
amendment
generally
prohibits
government
from
proscribing
speech
or
even
expressive
conduct
because
of
disapproval
of
the
ideas
expressed.
there
are,
however,
a
few
limited
categories
of
speech
such
as
obscenity,
defamation,
and
fighting
words
that
have
traditionally
been
subject
to
regulation
on
a
basis
of
content.
although
we
have
sometimes
said
in
our
cases
that
these
categories
of
expression
are
"not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protect
speech",
all
that
such
statements
mean
is
that
these
areas
of
speech
can
consistently
with
the
first
amendment
be
regulated
because
of
their
constitutionally
proscribeable
content.
that
is
because
of
their
obscenity,
defamation,
etcetera.
it
does
not
mean
that
they
are
categories
of
speech
entirely
invisible
to
the
constitution
so
that
they
may
be
made
of
vehicles
for
content
discrimination
unrelated
to
their
distinctively
proscribeable
content.
thus,
the
government
may
not
regulate
fighting
words
based
on
hostility
or
favoritism
towards
a
protected
message
that
the
fighting
words
contain.
just
as
a
city
council,
for
example,
could
not
prohibit
only
that
obscenity
which
criticizes
the
city
council.
regulation
of
fighting
words
and
other
proscribeable
categories
of
speech
may,
however,
be
under
inclusive
addressing
some
offensive
instances
and
leaving
other
equal
offensive
instances
alone
so
long
as
the
selectective
prescription
is
not
based
on
content
or
there
is
no
realistic
possibility
that
regulation
of
ideas
is
afoot.
in
light
of
these
principles
we
conclude
that
the
ordinance,
even
as
narrowly
construed
by
the
state
supreme
court,
is
facially
unconstitutional
because
it
imposes
special
prohibitions
on
those
speakers
who
express
views
on
the
disfavored
subjects
of
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender.
moreover,
in
its
practical
operation
the
ordinance
goes
beyond
mere
content
discrimination
to
actual
viewpoint
discrimination
fighting
words
that
do
not
themselves
invoke
race,
color,
creed,
religion,
or
gender.
aspersions
upon
a
person's
mother,
for
example,
would
seemingly
be
usable
ad
libitum
in
the
placards
of
those
arguing
in
favor
of
racial,
color,
etc.
,
tolerance
and
equality
but
could
not
be
used
by
that
speaker's
opponents.
st.
paul's
expressed
desire
to
communicate
to
minority
groups,
that
it
does
not
condone
the
group
hatred
of
bias-motivated
speech,
does
not
justify
selectively
silencing
speech
based
on
it
content.
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
this
court's
belief
that
burning
a
cross
in
someone's
front
yard
is
reprehensible.
but,
st.
paul
has
sufficient
means
at
its
disposal
to
prevent
such
behavior
without
adding
the
first
amendment
to
the
fire.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
