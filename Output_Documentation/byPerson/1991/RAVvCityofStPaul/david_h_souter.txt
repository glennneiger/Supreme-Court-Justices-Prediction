justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
words
that
injure,
is
it
your
position
that
the
only
words
that
injure
that
can
constitutionally
be
punished
are
threats?
justice
david
h.
souter
threats
to
immediate
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you...
where
do
you
want
to
draw
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
i
was
drawing
the
chaplinsky
distinction
between
the
fighting
words
and
the
words
that
injure,
and
i
thought
they
were
talking
about
two
separate
categories.
do
you
think
they
are
not
talking
about
two
separate
categories,
or
the
court
was
not
talking
about
two
separate
categories
in
chaplinsky?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
with
respect
just
to
the
words
that
injure,
where
would
you
draw
the
line
on
what
is
permissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
hard
enough
so
that
in
fact
we
have
to
say
that
that
simply
was
a
mistaken
statement
and
disavow
it
and
leave
chaplinsky
with
the
fighting
words
category
in
the
strict
sense
as
a
lone
subject
to
punishment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
agree,
but
aren't
you
really
coming
to
the
point
of
saying
that
the
chaplinsky
reference
to
words
that
injure
was
in
fact,
at
least
by
today's
standards,
an
erroneous
reference
and
we
should
disavow
chaplinsky
to
that
extent?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
that
because
they
can
prevent
or
punish
all
fighting
words,
they
can
select
any
category
within
the
broad
scope
of
fighting
words
for
it
to
be
singled
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
true,
then
why
isn't
it
equally
true
in
a
case
in
which
there's
a
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction?
why
can't
that
be,
since
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
are
constitutional,
why
can't
they,
too,
be
limited
to
certain
particular
harms
based
on
content?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
can
have
content-based
time,
place,
and
manner?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
fighting
words
simply
is
not
protected
speech
as
such,
and
therefore,
we
can
select
anything
within
the
category
of
fighting
words.
it's
different
from
time,
place,
and
manner
in
that
respect,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
true
that
the,
at
least
up
to
now,
that
any
concept
we
may
have
had
of
fighting
words
has
been
a
concept
which
took
fighting
words
as
a
whole
and
assumed
that
to
the
extent
that
they
could
be
punished,
they
would
be
punished
as
fighting
words,
not
as
categories
within
fighting
words?
so
that
if
we
accepted
your
view,
we
would
be
making
new
law,
wouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
foley,
i'm
having
trouble
with
terminology
and
it
may
be
my
fault,
but
i
have
assumed
that
chaplinsky
spoke
to
two
different
categories,
the
words
that
injure
category
and
the
fighting
words
category.
are
you
claiming
that
at
least
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
understands
those
two
sets
of
terms,
or
those
two
categories,
that
this
is
a
fighting
words
case
or
a
word
or
expression
that
injures
case?
or
does
it
have
to
be
both
as
you
understand
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
construction?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
at
least
allege
that
there
is
a
fighting
words
offense
here,
that
there
is
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
implied
by
what
you
have
alleged
about
the
burning
of
the
cross?
justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
your
earlier
answer,
if
i
understand
it,
with
respect
to
the
infliction
of
injury
point,
your
theory
is
that
because
the
category
of
words
that
inflict
injury
are
outside
first
amendment
protection,
it
is
not
an
objection
in
this
case
that
the
particular
words
or
expression
that
inflict
injury
are
identified
by
means
of
content.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
for
the
reasons
i
just
gave?
