justice

that's
what
you
said
to
me,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
foley,
i
take
it
you
are
not
arguing
that
if
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
had
not
been
narrowed
by
the
supreme
court
that
it
would
have,
that
it
would
be
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
have
some
trouble,
then,
with
the
lewis

words
and
any
fool
would
know
what
a
fighting
word
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
court
didn't...
it
left
the
ordinance
reading
exactly
what...
left
all
the
words
in
the
ordinance
in
there.
they
didn't
say,
which
they
might
have...
they
should
have
said
that
to
the
extent
this
statute
reaches
other
than
fighting
words,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
it
didn't
say
that,
it
just
gave
a
construction,
and
left
those
words...
all
the
words
in
