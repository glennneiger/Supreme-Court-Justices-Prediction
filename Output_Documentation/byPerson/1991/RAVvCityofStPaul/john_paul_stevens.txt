justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
held
that
the
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
it
uphold
the
charge?
didn't
the
case
go
back
for
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
supreme
court
did
not
send
it
back
for
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
did
send
it
back
for
trial,
is
it
not
necessarily
true
that
they
held
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
alleged
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
other
case
you
cite,
or
your
opponent,
i
guess,
that's
the
s.l.j.
case,
when
they
narrowly
construed
it
they
said,
therefore
the
conduct
isn't
within
the
statute
and
they
dismissed
the
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
they
left
open
the
question
whether
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
normally
you're
more
interested
in
judgments.
i
mean,
the
defendant
ought
to
know
whether
or
not
he's
been
charged
with
an
offense
or
not,
and
he
still
doesn't
know.
that's
your
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
whether
permissibly
charged...
well,
okay.
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me...
may
i
interrupt
with
this
question?
as
you
read
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
would
it
violate
the
statute
for
a
person
to,
who
lived
in
an
integrated
neighborhood
to
burn
a
cross
in
his
own
front
yard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
the
only
facts
you
know.
if
they
burn
the
cross,
is
there
an
element
of
intent
that
you
allege
in
your
count
against
these
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
would
arouse
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
in
others.
and
if
you
made
this
same
allegation
against
a
person
who
lived
in
an
integrated
neighborhood
where
people
go
by
his
front
yard
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night,
would
you
not
think
that
would
arouse,
alarm,
and
resentment
that
perhaps--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
have
not
alleged
in
count
2
that
is
targeted
at
a
particular
individual,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
know
anything
except
what's
in
the...
alleged
in
counts
1
and
2
of
the
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this,
it
came
up
on
motion
to
dismiss,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
how
can
we
look
at
anything
except
what
you've
alleged
in
the
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can't
make
up
facts
that
you
have
it
alleged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
police
reports
are
a
part
of
the
charging
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
statute,
not
an
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
s.l.j.
wasn't
it
a
statute,
not
an
ordinance?
