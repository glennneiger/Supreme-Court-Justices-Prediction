mr.
tom
foley
yes,
i
am,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
tom
foley
yes,
under
minnesota
law,
justice
blackmun,
the
county
attorney
handles
all
matters
involving
juveniles
and
this
matter
was
a
prosecution
of
a
juvenile,
so
we
represent
any
activity,
whether
the
matter
is
under
a
city
ordinance
or
state
ordinance
or
a
federal
crime.
mr.
tom
foley
that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
tom
foley
it
is
an
unusual--
mr.
tom
foley
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
tom
foley

mr.
tom
foley
290
earl
street.
mr.
tom
foley
i
don't
have
the
cross
street,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
tom
foley
it's
near
mounds
park.
mr.
tom
foley
justice,
under
our
constitution
everyone
is
presumed
innocent
until
they've
had
a
trial.
[laughter]
mr.
tom
foley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
amendment
was
never
intended
to
protect
an
individual
who
burns
a
cross
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
the
fenced
yard
of
an
african-american
family's
home.
the
city
of
st.
paul
has
the
right
to
prohibit
and
prosecute
such
conduct.
the
ordinance
at
issue
in
this
case
has
been
interpreted
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
to
prohibit
only
conduct
that
inflicts
injury,
tends
to
incite
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace,
or
provokes
imminent
lawless
action.
mr.
tom
foley
your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
yes,
did
decide
that
the
conduct
came
under
the
ordinance
and
set
it
back
for
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
tom
foley
yes,
sir.
and
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
abandon
its
holdings
in
chaplinsky
and
brandenburg,
holdings
that
it
has
upheld
for
the
last
50
years,
this
ordinance
must
be
upheld.
in
this
oral
argument
i'm
going
to
touch
on
four
propositions.
first
is
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance.
second,
that
the
ordinance
has
been
narrowly
construed
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
only
to
apply
to
fighting
words.
third,
that
the
ordinance
as
construed
is
not
overbroad
or
vague.
and
fourth,
that
the
ordinance
does
not
interfere
with
legitimate
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
tom
foley
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
the
statute
is
not
underinclusive,
that
this
is
a
fighting
words
case,
that
this
is
unprotected
conduct
under
the
first
amendment,
and
that
the
city
of
st.
paul
has
the
right
to
determine
which
harms
it
can
proscribe
within
the
limits
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
tom
foley
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
it
is
not
a
content-based
ordinance,
that
it
certainly
could
be
used
to
be
a
content-neutral
ordinance.
mr.
tom
foley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
foley
your
honor,
we
have
alternative
theories
that
it
is
content-based,
but
it
is
unprotected
conduct
because
it
is
fighting
words,
but
we
also
believe
that
the
main
purpose
of
the
ordinance
is
not
to
limit
freedom
of
expression
in
that
the
harm
that
it's
attempting
to
regulate
is
neutral
and
it
could
be
considered
content-neutral
under
the
renton-barnes
analysis
that
this
court
has
engaged
in,
but
even
if
the
court
feels
that
it
is
content-based,
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
purpose
in
public
safety
and
order
and
safety
of
their
citizens
for
the
city
of
st.
paul
to
pass
such
an
ordinance.
mr.
tom
foley
i
think
the
city
has
an
absolute
right
and
purpose
to
try
to
regulate
the
harm
that
goes
onto
its
citizens.
and
certainly
this
bias-motivated
conduct
and
violence
is
much
more
harmful
and
has
more
harmful
impacts
to
its
citizens--
mr.
tom
foley
--your
honor,
the
city
of
st.
paul
is
attempting
to
fashion
responses
to
violence
that
it
deems
necessary
to
prohibit
and
will
add
additional
harms
to
be
regulated
as
it
finds
them.
under
this
particular
ordinance,
it
seemed
that
this
is
a
particular
harm
going
on
that
is
necessary
within
the
city
of
st.
paul
to
prohibit
and
regulate.
mr.
tom
foley
your
honor,
i
think
it's
the
city's
position
that
this
is
a
fighting
words
case,
that
the
ordinance
has
been
sufficiently
narrowed
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
and
you
could
reread
that
ordinance
under
these
facts
to
say
that
whoever
based
on
race,
places
an
object
or
symbol
with
the
intent
to
inflict
injury,
incite
immediate
violence,
or
provoke
imminent
lawless
action
is
guilty
of
a
crime.
and
i
think
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
narrowing
of
that
ordinance
is
sufficient
to
uphold
its
constitutionality
under
the
chaplinsky
and
brandenburg
holdings
of
this
court.
mr.
tom
foley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
foley
the...
i
think
they
can
specify
the
harm.
mr.
tom
foley
yes.
no,
no.
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
didn't
catch
the
question.
the
content-based
application
of
this
ordinance,
under
fighting
words,
is
clearly
within
the
power,
if
you
find
that
it
is
a
fighting
words
case
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
certainly
the
city
has
the
right
to
prohibit
harms
that
it
sees
are
very
harmful
to
citizens
of
st.
paul.
mr.
tom
foley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
foley
i
don't
believe
we
would
be
making
new
law
under
that
analysis.
i
think
under
the
fighting
words
doctrine,
if
there
is
action
that
either
inflicts
injury
or
causes
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
and
under
this
particular
ordinance
as
construed
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
there
has
to
be
action
combined
with
an
intent
to
cause
that
action
with
the
defined
affect
of
being
based
on
the
race,
in
this
particular
case,
of
the
jones
family.
and
i
think
under
that
narrowing
of
the
elements
of
this
particular
crime,
it
falls
within
a
very
narrow
category
of
fighting
words
and
falls
within
the
chaplinsky-brandenburg
doctrine
as
outlined
by
this
court.
mr.
tom
foley
it
does
have
a
bearing
on
the
violation
of
this
ordinance
in
how
you
analyze
what
is
a
violation
of
fighting
words.
in
this
particular
case
there
was
the
burning
of
the
cross
within
the
fenced
yard
of
the
jones
family.
it
was
an
immediate
threat
to
inflict
injury
and
fear
to
the
jones
family
to
cause
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace.
and
in
analyzing
the
ordinance,
you
really
have
to
look
at
the
total
circumstance
and
the
context
used.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
indicated
that
not
all
cross
burnings
were
illegal,
only
those
that--
mr.
tom
foley
--your
honor--
mr.
tom
foley
--your
honor,
we
believe
this
ordinance
would
not
be
applicable
if
the
burning
cross
was
done
in
a
public
forum
or
in
a
political
parade
of
some
sort.
it's
only
when
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
done
in
a
manner
to
inflict
injury
or
cause
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
that
it
violates
this
particular
narrowed
ordinance
as
construed
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
mr.
tom
foley
not
with...
it
would
not
unless
there
was
the
intent
to
cause,
to
inflict
injury--
mr.
tom
foley
--there's
an
element
of
intent
with
the
ordinance
saying
know
or
have
reason
to
know
that
it
would
arouse--
mr.
tom
foley
--it
would
not
arouse
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
under
the
fighting
words
doctrine
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
had
previously
construed
that
language
in
the
s.l.j.
case.
it's
only
when
it
arouses
anger,
alarm,
or
resentment
that
arises
to
fighting
words,
again,
inflicting
injury.
it
has
to
be
more
than
offending
the
sensibilities.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
injury
and
the
immediate
breach
of
the
peace.
is
it
targeted
and
directed
at
a
particular
individual?
and
under--
mr.
tom
foley
--the
burning
of
the
cross
in
the
fenced
yard--
mr.
tom
foley
--i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
facts
that--
mr.
tom
foley
--yes
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
foley
on
a,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
facts
of
the
file
are
all
construed
on
behalf
of
the
nonmoving
party.
mr.
tom
foley
no,
but
the
facts
that
have
been
submitted
to
the
court
and
all
of
the
police
reports
that
go
to
the
intent
of
the--
mr.
tom
foley
--in
minnesota
we
have
filed
all
of
the
police
reports
in,
with
the
petition
to
the
court.
mr.
tom
foley
they
should
be
submitted
to
you
and
have
all
the
police
reports.
mr.
tom
foley
my
understanding
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
construction
is
that
it
could
be
either.
it
could
either
be
the
inflicts
injury
prong
of
the
chaplinsky
decision,
which
this
court
has
never
really
addressed
since
announcing
it
in
chaplinsky,
or
the
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
prong,
and
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
upheld
both
prongs
as
still
good,
viable
law
and
sent
it
back
to
the
trier
of
fact
to
look
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
the
context
in
which
this
occurred.
mr.
tom
foley
your
honor,
i
think
we
allege
both
prongs
in
this
and
that
we
would
rely
more
heavily
on
the
inflicts
injury
prong
to
the
family,
the
jones
family,
the
burning
of
the
cross
in
the
middle
of
the
night
outside
of
their
home
is
more
than
just
outrageous
conduct.
it
is
a
direct
harm
to
these
people,
causing
fear,
intimidation,
threats,
and
coercion
and
i
think
that
this
court
could
look
at
that
inflicts
injury
and
indicate
what
does
the
injury
prong
of
chaplinsky,
what
does
it
do?
it
invaded
a
substantial
privacy
interest
of
these
people
in
a
totally
intolerable
manner,
and
we
think
that
the
injury
prong
should
be
addressed,
but
there
is
still--
mr.
tom
foley
--excuse
me.
we
also
feel
that
the
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
prong
is
viable
under
these
facts
as
alleged
in
the
petition.
mr.
tom
foley
we
think
they
can
be
content-based
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
tom
foley
yes.
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
bias-motivated
violence
which
is
significantly
more
harmful
on
the
impact
than
similar
criminal
conduct
not
similarly
motivated.
the
burning
of
the
cross
and
the
african-american
family
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
simple
trespass
or
minor
arson,
either
to
the
targeted
victims
or
to
the
community
in
which
it
occurred.
mr.
tom
foley
i
don't
believe
under
the
facts
that
you
described
that
it
would.
mr.
tom
foley
it's
probably
not
addressed
under
this
particular
ordinance.
there
are
other
alternative
criminal
laws
that
may
apply
to
that
particular
situation.
mr.
tom
foley
well,
there
are
many
reasons
that
cities
and
state
legislatures
look
to
a
particular
wrong
that
they
are
attempting
to
address,
and
i
don't
think
they
address
all
of
those
wrongs
at
the
same
time,
and
they
attempt
to
get
as
many
of
them
as
they
can
and
they
do
address
in
a
content-based...
under
certain
circumstances,
certain
harms
that
they
want
to
address
and
including--
mr.
tom
foley
--i
think
the
minnesota
supreme
court
addressed
or
made
reference
to
that
issue
when
it
said
that
the
particular
city
ordinance
could
have
been
drawn
a
little
bit
better,
but
then
went
on
to
clearly
narrow
the
impact
of
that
ordinance
and
narrowed
it
only
to
apply
to
fighting
words.
and
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
burning
of
the
cross,
the
historical
context
of
a
burning
cross
in
the
middle
of
the
night
is
a
precursor
to
violence
and
hatred
in
this
country--
mr.
tom
foley
--we
do
rely
on
ferber
and
fcc
v.
pacifica
as
certain
harms
that
this
court
has
looked
at
and
addressed
to
protect
certain
individuals
from
harm,
and
certainly
didn't
mean
to
overlook
the
ferber
decision.
in
the
case
of
bias-motivated
crimes,
there
is
a
compelling
state
purpose
to
deal
with
what
is
a
cancer
on
society
and
it
will
unless
effectively
dealt
with
spread
throughout
the
community.
bias-motivated
crimes
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
particular
target
victims
and
equally
profound
effect
on
all
members
of
the
minority
that
is
indirectly
targeted
and
a
pervasive
effect
on
the
community
as
a
whole.
mr.
tom
foley
no,
your
honor.
we
think
it
would
have
been
constitutional,
unconstitutional
under
the--
mr.
tom
foley
--i
don't
believe
so--
mr.
tom
foley
--i
believe,
justice
white,
your
first
question
is
that
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
as
written
under
the
gooding
decision,
and
when
the
lewis
case
was
sent
back
in
light
of
gooding,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
essentially
made
very
little
effort
to
abide
by
the
gooding
decision
in
how
it
referenced
fighting
words,
but
clearly
the
statute
had
a
broader,
more
sweeping
view
of--
mr.
tom
foley
--it
said
it
was
narrowing
it
to
fighting
words,
but
left
in
effect
some
of
the
language
that
was
clearly...
appropriate
language
that
was
clearly
broader--
mr.
tom
foley
--the
lewis
court
just
made
a
reference
to
fighting
words.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
not
only
made
reference
to
fighting
words,
but
each
of
the
individual
prongs
cited
in
the
opinion
also
cited
brandenberg
in
the
imminent
lawless
action,
it
attempted
to
follow
the
directions
of
this
court
as
precisely
as
it
could
from
the
lewis
decision
and
cites
to...
and
attempts
to
distinguish
the
lewis
decision,
and
i
think
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
include
fighting
words
and
limit
according
to
previous
rulings
of
minnesota,
very
similar
to
what
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
did
in
chaplinsky.
so
i
think
it
did
make...
is
different
than
the
lewis
holding.
given
the
historical
experience
of
african-americans,
a
burning
cross
targeted
at
a
black
family
under
the
circumstances
outlined
is
an
unmistakable
threat.
terroristic
conduct
such
as
this
can
find
no
protection
in
the
constitution.
thank
you,
your
honors.
