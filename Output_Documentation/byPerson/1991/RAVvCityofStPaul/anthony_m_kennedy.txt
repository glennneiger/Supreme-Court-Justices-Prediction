justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
view,
what
is
the
constitutional
boundaries
for
the
fighting
words
doctrine,
only
those
words
which
would
provoke
some
other
person
to
an
assault
on
the
speaker,
physical
assault?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
a
state
validly
proscribe
words
that
cause
alarm
and
fear
for
one's
safety,
even
if
the
fear
for
the
breach
of
the
safety
is
some
act
that
will
occur
maybe
24
hours,
48
hours
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
answer
to
me
was
that
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
is
not
required.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
constitutional
test
that
you
propose
for
those
fighting
words,
whatever
that
means,
which
can
be
proscribed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
theory
that
the
hearer
will
commit
violence
on
the
speaker?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
the
theory
the
state
proceeds
on
here
so
far
as
you
understand
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
theory
constitutional
so
far
as
applied
to
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
could
this
conduct
be
punished
by
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
that
proscribes
threats
that
cause
violence?
could
that
state
a
cause
of
action
against
your
client?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
these
facts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
listener
fears
for
the
listener's
safety?
is
that
a
proscribable
kind
of
expression?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
the
listener
fears
for
the
listener's
safety.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
threat
in
your
view
has
to
be
imminent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
listener
fears
for
the
listener's
safety
over
the
period
of
the
next
month.
is
that
an
imminent
danger?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
15
policemen
there
when
the
cross
is
being
burned
and
so
there
is
no
imminent
danger
in
that
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
