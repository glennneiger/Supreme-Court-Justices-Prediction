chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-1424,
manuel
lujan
v.
the
defenders
of
wildlife.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
she
say
when
she
observed--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
she
say
when
in
the
past
she
had
observed
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
is
not
challenging
the
repair
of
the
aswan...
the
specific
project.
she
is
just
challenging
a
regular...
an
interpretive
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
the
mahaweli
project?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
o'neill,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
she
say
anything
more
specific
about
her
plan
to
return
than
that,
other
than
that
she
planned
to...
as
i
understand
it
from
the
solicitor
general,
she
said
she
did
not
have
any
definite
plan
to
return.
did
she
say
anything
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
she
not
only
didn't
have
a
plan
ticket,
she
didn't
have
any
plan,
it
sounds
from
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
eighth
circuit
grant
him...
grant
your
organization
standing
on
his
behalf?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
cross-appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
i
don't
think
he
can
be
involved
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
you
can
invoke
different
persons
who
may
have
been
deposed,
since
what
we're
talking
about
is
organizational
standing.
and
the
eighth
circuit
sustained
your
organization's
standing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
want
to
speak
about
mr....
the
gentleman
you
just
spoke--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
the
world
bank
isn't
a
united
states
agency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
sounds
very
much
like
the
house
that
jack
built.
[laughter]
we're
talking
about
an
interior
department,
interior...
interpretive
regulation.
and
you're
telling
us
that
the
world
bank
was
going
to
fund
a
project
in
thailand.
i
mean,
there
just
seems
to
be
a
great
deal
of
distance
between
the
two.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
still
take
that
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
say
that
about
a
lot
of
cases,
mr.
o'neill,
in
which
we've
said
there
was
no
standing.
it's
a
perfectly
good
record.
a
plaintiff
with
standing
might
not
bring
much
more
to
the
case,
and
nonetheless,
we've
fairly
rigorously
enforced
our
standing
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
you
say
a
visit
10
years
ago
suffices.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
asian
elephants
might
come
over
here
so
he
could
study
them
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
pressing
the
outer
envelope
of
standing.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'neill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
