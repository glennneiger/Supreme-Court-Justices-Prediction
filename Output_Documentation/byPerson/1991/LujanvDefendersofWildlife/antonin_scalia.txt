she'd
have
to
prove
that
there
would
be
the
adverse
consequence.
i
thought
the
statute
was
designed
to
avoid...
you
know,
minimize
the
danger
that
that
would
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
is
there
any
other
way
we
might,
one
day,
reach
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
the
interior
department
bind
other
agencies
in
this
regard?
i
mean,
i
think
the
interior
department
can
say,
you
know,
whether
it
will
consult
or
not.
but
i
don't
see
how
the
interior
department
can
bind
them
not
to
do
the
funding.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
interior
department
had
not
issued
these
regulations,
one
of
the
points
made
by
the
government
is
there's...
there's
nothing
to
show
that
the
agencies,
themselves,
would
not
have
adopted
the
position
taken
in
the
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
they
would
not
consult,
in
which
case
you'd
have
the
same
result
you
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
a
correct
statement,
then
you
haven't
met
one
of
the
conditions
for
standing,
is...
which
is
that
the
injury
you
complain
about
would
not
occur
if
the
relief
you
were
given
is
accorded.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you've
just
said
is
that
whether
the...
whether
the
secretary
has
this
regulation
out
or
not,
it
may
well
be
that
these
agencies
won't
consult.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
secretary's
position
is.
the
point
is,
if
the
agencies...
have
that
same
position,
they
are
not
going
to
consult.
and
therefore,
just
getting
the
secretary
to
change
his
mind
is
not
going
to
give
you
the
relief
you
want.
the
agencies
may
still
not
consult.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can
attack
that
when
somebody
doesn't
consult,
goes
ahead
and
funds
a
project.
and
then
you
can
attack
that
agency
that
funds
the
project.
but
trying
to
do
that
indirectly
by
attacking
the
secretary,
when
you
don't
know...
the
agency
might
go
ahead
and
adopt
the
same
interpretation
of
the
law
that
the
secretary
has
adopted.
it's
very
likely
that
the
agency
would.
even
if
the...
even
if
the
secretary
withdrew
this,
it
seems
to
me
very
likely
that
the
other
agencies
of
government...
regardless
of
his
regulation...
would
continue
to
adopt
the
same
position.
so
this
court
would
have
issued
an
opinion,
spun
its
wheels,
for
no
benefit
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
know
that.
they
may
not
be
consulting
simply
because
they
agree
with
the
secretary...
since
they're
in
the
same
government
as
the
secretary,
i
bet
you
they
do.
so
even
if
he...
even
if
he
withdrew
this
regulation,
you're
going
to
have
the
same
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
a
means
of
challenging
that.
if
and
when
an
agency
goes
ahead
and
funds
a
project
without
consulting,
go
get
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
lab
says
you
can
challenge
a
rule,
but...
in
abbott
labs,
by
striking
down
the
rule,
we
would...
we
eliminated
the
obstacle
that
the
plaintiffs
were
complaining
about...
namely,
they
thought
that
they
could
not
issue
these
pharmaceuticals
with
these
labels,
because
the
secretary
had
said
if
you
do,
you'll
be
prosecuted.
once
we
struck
that
down,
that
obstacle
was
eliminated.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
we
can
strike
down
this
regulation
and
we
don't
know
that
the
obstacle
will
be
eliminated.
the
other...
crucial
to
the
relief
you
want
is
that
the
agency
consult.
and
if
the
agencies
have
the
same
view
of
the
law
that
the
secretary
does...
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
likely
that
they
do...
you're
wasting
our
time.
we
can
give
you
everything
you
ask,
and
nothing
will
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
come
back
to
what
i
was
asking
you,
your
response
to
the
fact
that
the
secretary's
decision
won't
make
any
difference
is,
well,
of
course,
once
we
decide
that
it's
unlawful,
the
other
agencies
will
fall
in
line.
how
is
that
any
different
from
a
case
in
which
i
try
to
challenge
a
law
of
indiana
as
being
unconstitutional?
and,
in
fact,
i
don't
live
in
indiana;
i'm
not
a
citizen
of
indiana.
this
law
doesn't
apply
to
me.
but
there
is
a
similar
law
in
new
york
that
is
applying
to
me.
now,
would
i
have
standing
to
challenge
the
indiana
law
because
once
the
court
says
that
that
law
is
unconstitutional,
of
course
new
york
will
comply
with
the
court's
decree.
would
i
really
have
standing
in
indiana--
justice
antonin
scalia
--simply
because
the
judgment
will
pronounce
a
determination
of
law
that
will
be
obeyed
by
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you'd
say
that
the
other
agencies
are
bound
to
follow
the
secretary's
determination?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
secretary
could
comply,
i
suppose,
by
simply
withdrawing
the
regulation
and
not
saying
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
right,
that
those
are
substantial
differences.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
case

lujan
versus
defenders
of
wildlife,
no.
90-1424.
that
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
gives
certain
responsibilities
for
protecting
endangered
species
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
secretary
of
commerce,
and
it
requires
other
federal
agencies
to
consult
with
the
relevant
secretary
to
ensure
that
an
action
they
fund
is
not
likely
to
jeopardize
a
species
or
a
habitat.
the
secretaries
have
issued
a
joint
regulation
stating
that
this
consultation
requirement
does
not
extend
to
agency-funded
actions
in
foreign
countries.
respondents,
who
are
wildlife
conservation
and
other
environmental
organizations,
filed
suit
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior
asking
the
district
court
to
declare
that
the
consultation
requirement
does
apply
to
actions
in
foreign
countries,
and
to
order
the
secretary
to
promulgate
a
revised
regulation.
the
secretary
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
claiming
that
respondents
lack
standing.
the
district
court
granted
that
motion
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
parties
filed
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
denied
the
secretary's,
which
had
renewed
his
standing
objection,
and
granted
respondent's
motion
ordering
the
secretary
to
publish
a
new
rule.
this
time,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
need
reach
only
the
secretary's
claim
that
respondents
lack
standing.
as
plaintiffs,
respondents
have
the
burden
of
establishing
the
court's
jurisdiction.
one
element
of
which
is
that
they
possess
article
iii
standing
to
sue.
standing
requires
that
the
plaintiff
had
suffered
an
injury
in
fact,
a
term
of
art
which
we
have
defined
as
the
actual
or
imminent
invasion
of
a
concrete
and
particularized
interest
of
the
plaintiffs.
standing
also
requires
what
is
called
redressibility,
that
is
the
ability
of
the
court
to
provide
some
relief
for
the
injury
in
fact.
to
survive
the
secretary's
summary
judgment
therefore,
respondents
have
to
establish
through
affidavits
or
otherwise
specific
facts
showing
first,
that
they
were
injured
in
fact
by
the
lack
of
consultation
and
second,
that
the
courts
ordering
the
secretary
to
revise
his
regulation
would
remedy
that
injury.
respondents
first
attempted
to
show
injury
through
the
affidavits
of
two
of
their
members
to
the
effect
that
a
united
states
agency
is
providing
part
of
the
funding
for
two
foreign
projects
that
are
jeopardizing
certain
endangered
animals,
and
that
these
members
had
visited
those
project
areas
previously
and
intended
to
do
so
again
at
some
time
in
the
indefinite
future.
at
which
point,
they
would
be
denied
the
ability
to
observe
the
animals.
we
do
not
think
this
suffices
to
show
an
injury
in
fact.
the
inability
to
observe
an
animal
can
create
an
injury
in
fact.
that
inability,
however,
must
be
imminent
and
the
member's
lack
of
firm
plans
to
return
to
the
sites
defeats
their
claim
for
standing.
we
also
reject
respondents'
novel
nexus
injury
theories
under
which
anyone
who
either
uses
the
same
ecosystem
as
a
threatened
animal
likes
to
observe
animals
or
has
a
professional
interest
in
them
may
sue
without
having
to
make
any
further
showing.
we
do
not
think
that
a
mere
interest
in
a
type
of
animal
without
more
can
create
an
injury
in
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
that
respondents
had
suffered
a
procedural
injury
by
which
it
meant
that
the
endangered
species
act
grants
to
all
citizens
a
right
to
have
the
agencies
consult
with
the
secretary
and
that
each
citizen
may
sue
to
enforce
that
right
even
if
he
has
no
further
interest
in
the
matter.
we
hold
that
a
procedural
injury
is
not
an
injury
in
fact
under
article
iii
and
the
person
may
seek
to
enforce
procedural
rights
only
to
the
extent
they
safeguard
a
threatened
concrete
injury
of
his
own.
vindicating
the
public
interest
is
the
function
of
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
to
allow
the
public
interest
to
be
converted
into
an
actionable
individual
right
by
a
statute
permitting
all
citizens
to
sue
regardless
of
whether
they
suffered
any
separate
concrete
injury
would
allow
congress
to
transfer
to
the
courts
the
president's
constitutional
duty
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
a
portion
of
the
opinion
joined
by
only
four
justices
also
finds
that
the
plaintiffs
failed
to
satisfy
the
redressibility
requirement.
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
