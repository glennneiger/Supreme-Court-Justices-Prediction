justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would...
could
she
possibly
satisfy?
what
if
she'd
actually
seen
some
crocodiles,
and
she
said
they're
going
to
be
building
the
dam
until
1991
and
she
plans
to
go
back
in
1990,
or
something.
would
that
have
been
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
could
the
injury...
i
mean,
the
project
is
going
to
take
several
years
to
complete.
and
she
couldn't
be
injured...
her
theory
is
that
she's
injured
by
the
completion
of
the
project,
as
i
understand.
it
may
kill
off
the
crocodiles.
and
if
she's
seen
crocodiles
the
last
time,
she
says
sometime
a
couple
of
years
from
now,
she
wants
to
go
back
and
take
pictures
of
them
and
make
studies,
that
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
get
one
thing
i'm
troubled
by.
supposing
the
injury
is
she
won't
be
able
to
see
any
more
crocodiles.
she
likes
to
look
at
crocodiles
or
make
studies
of
them.
is
that
an
injury
that's
cognizable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
why
does
she
have
to
say
any
more
than
she
thinks
there's
a
danger
that
if
you
don't
consult
and
you
don't
avoid
the
environmental
hazard
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
the
crocodiles
may
become
extinct,
and
i
can't
see
any
more
crocodiles?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she's
kind
of
asked
to
do
her
own
environmental
impact
study.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
she...
relying
on
risk
of
injury
unless
adequate
is
made
first
to
determine
whether
or
not
those
injuries
would
occur.
that's
not
enough,
in
your
view.
she
has
to...
she
has
the
affirmative
burden
of
establishing
injury
as
a
result
of
the
project.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
part
of...
would
it
be
part
of
her
burden
to
also
prove
that
the
foreign
government
could
no
get
financing
elsewhere?
because
i
guess
it's
always...
there's
always
a
possibility
that
the
government
could
build
its
own
dams
and
all
the
rest
of
it
without
american
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
part
of
her
burden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
have
the
argument,
don't
they,
that
the
interpretation
that
it
applied
abroad
had
issued
before
the...
statute
was
amended
and
was
amended
without...
without
comment
on
that?
so
it's
an
argument
that
they
assumed
that
it
applied
overseas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
presumption
that
congress
would
be
aware
of
regulations
implementing
an
earlier
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
know
there's
no
affirm...
i'm
just
asking
if
there's
a
presumption
that
congress
knows
what
the
law
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
presuming
that
those
agencies
would
disregard
a
decision
of
this
court
interpreting
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable
presumption,
is
it,
that
the
agencies
would
xx
to
follow
our
interpretation
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
stop
you
there,
for
just
a
moment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
authority
for
that
the
guideline
that's
in
pages
28
to
30
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
they
talked
about
the
general
parameters,
that
section
7
applies
to
activities
and
programs
by
federal
agencies
affecting
listed
species
in
foreign
countries
and
high
seas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
the
language,
basically,
you're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because...
i
have
this
question
in
reading
it.
it's
clear
that
it
applies
to
endangered
species
in
foreign
countries
and
on
the
high
seas,
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
that
applies
to
projects
located
out
of
the
united
states.
because
you
could
have
projects
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state...
of
the
united
states
that
affect
species
in
mexico
or
canada
or
something
like
that.
but
i'm
not...
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
the
project
had
to
be
located
out
of
the
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
can
see
that.
and
do
they
disagree
with
that?
if
there
were
a
project
on
the
canadian
border
that
would
cause
acid
rain
or
something
like
that
and
affect
species
across
the
border,
wouldn't
they
agree
there
would
be
consultation
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
do
you...
what
is
it
that
you
say,
in
the
prior
guidelines,
made
it
clear
that
the...
that
the
project
outside
the
united
states
was
governed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that...
overlook
the
language
"ensure
that
any
action
authorized
is
not
likely
to.
"
doesn't
that
impose
an
obligation
on...
of
some
kind
of
best
efforts,
at
least,
to
be
sure
what
happens
in
the
foreign
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
so
then
doesn't
that...
isn't
that
a
response
to
your
most
recent
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we're
only
putting
up
10
percent
of
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
with
respect
to
foreign
projects.
but
there
is
an
obligation
to
consult
with
regard
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
that
equal...
i
mean,
it
just
depends
on
the
scope
of
the
obligation.
why
is
one
any
more
mandatory
than
the
other?
it's
a
question
of
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
the
statute
clearly
applied
to
foreign
projects,
then
there
would
be
a
mandatory
duty
to
consult.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
the...
would
this
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute
be
entitled
to
deference
from
other
agencies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
his
reading
that
that
regulation
clearly
applied
to
foreign
projects,
as
well
as
species
in
foreign
countries?
