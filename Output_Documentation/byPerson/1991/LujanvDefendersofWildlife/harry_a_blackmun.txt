mr.
kneedler,
if
in
place
of
sri
lanka
and
egypt
this
were
antarctica,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
no
foreign
country?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
have
taken
the
position
it
applies
on
the
high
seas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
there's
no
clear
statement
to
that
effect
in
the
statute--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--but
presumably,
there's
no
law
in
antarctica,
anyway.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
weren't
they
due
to
a
change
in
the
administration,
in
your
view?
