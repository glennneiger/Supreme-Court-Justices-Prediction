mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eighth
circuit,
in
this
case,
invalidated
a
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1986
to
interpret
the
geographic
reach
of
the
first
sentence
of
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
endangered
species
act
of
1973.
that
sentence
provides
that
each
federal
agency,
in
consultation
with
the
secretary,
shall
ensure
that
any
action
it
authorizes,
funds,
or
carries
out,
is
not
likely
to
have
either
one
of
two
consequences:
first,
jeopardize
an
endangered
or
threatened
species
or,
second,
adversely
modify
habitat
that
is
determined
by
the
secretary,
after
consultation
with
affected
states,
to
be
critical
for
the
species.
the
secretary,
from
the
outset,
has
construed
the
portion
of
section
7(a)(2)
that
concerns
critical
habitat
of
a
species
not
to
apply
in
foreign
countries,
because
the
reference
to
affected
states
gives
it
a
domestic
focus,
and
because
application
in
foreign
countries
would
present
practical
difficulties
and
impose
this
nation's
environmental
laws
and
land
use
planning
on
foreign
countries.
neither
respondents
nor
the
courts
below
have
challenged
that
construction.
in
the
1986
interpretive
regulation
at
issue
here,
the
secretary
concluded,
for
similar
reasons,
that
the
portion
of
the
same
sentence
that
concerns
actions
that
affect
the
species
themselves
likewise
does
not
apply
in
foreign
countries.
the
court
of
appeals
invalidated
that
interpretation,
thereby
setting
aside
the
uniform
interpretation
of
not
only
the
agencies
charged
with
administering
the
act,
but
also
the
agencies
engaged
in
furnishing
assistance
to
foreign
governments
for
projects
in
their
countries.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
two
fundamental
respects.
first,
the
court
should
not
have
even
reached
the
merits
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation,
because
the
respondent
organizations
do
not
have
standing
to
challenge
it.
the
respondent
organizations
wholly
failed
to
carry
their
burden
of
showing
that
any
of
their
members
suffered
actual
or
threatened
injury
as
the
result
of
u.s.
assistance
to
a
project
in
a
foreign
country
affecting
their
ability
to
view
wildlife.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
first
place,
we
think
the
citizen
suit
provision
is
inapplicable
in
this
case
because
that
refers
to
situations
generally
where
persons
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
the
act.
the
secretary's
interpretive
regulation,
which
he
wasn't
even
required
to
issue
in
the
first
place,
in
our
view,
does
not
fall
within
the
citizens'
suit
provision.
the
provision
that
addresses
the
secretary's
enforcement
responsibilities,
which
is
what
respondents
seem
to
be
directing
their
suit
to,
does
not
govern
this
sort
of
regulation.
it
governs
a
specific
category
of
regulations
under
section
4
of
the
act.
so
in
the
first
place,
we
think
the
citizens'
suit
provision
is
inapplicable
here.
but
moreover,
the
citizens'
suit
provision,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
in
sea
clammers
and
other
cases,
cannot
extend
the
standing...
the
jurisdiction,
case
or
controversy
requirement...
jurisdiction
under
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
beyond
that
specified
in
this
court's
cases.
so
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what
would
be...
to
be
sure,
if
the
statute
defines
a
statutory
right
and
then
says
that
a
person
may
sue
for
a
violation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
that
right,
then
standing
would
result
because
congress
has
defined
the
right.
but
this...
the
citizens'
suit
provision
does
not
define
any
substantive
rights.
just
as
this
court
said
in
valley
forge,
the
apa
provision,
giving
any
person
aggrieved
a
right
to
sue,
does
not
define
substantive
rights,
it
simply
creates
a
cause
of
action.
so
respondents
would
be
required
to
look
elsewhere
in
the
endangered
species
act
for
any
substantive
rights
that
they
would
seek
to
invoke
in
this
case.
at
one
point,
respondents
were
arguing
that
they
had
certain
procedural
rights
to
have
one
agency
consult
with
another
regarding
projects
in
foreign
countries.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
petition
and
brief,
that
holding
by
the
eighth
circuit
to
that
effect
was
inconsistent
with
every
other
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
it.
and
respondents
do
not,
as
we
understand
it,
defend
it
here,
because
procedural
rights
can
only
be
invoked
by
persons
who
have
a
substantive
stake
in
the
agency's
decision.
so
unless
respondents
can
show
that
some
of
their
members
had
an
actual
stake
in
a
foreign
project
and
were
injured
there,
the
fact
that
there
might
be
procedural
provisions
under
the
act
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
them
standing.
so
to
come
back
to
your
question,
and
argue
this
case
does
not
arise
under
the
citizens'
suit
provision.
it's
essentially
an
apa
challenge
to
a
regulation.
and
as
such,
as
a...
if
the
a...
regulation
is
the
agency
action,
this
court
has
made
clear,
just
two
terms
ago
in
the
national
wildlife
federation
case,
that
unless
a
statute
specifically
provides
for
a...
challenge
to
a
regulation
as
soon
as
it's
issued,
ordinarily
a
person
has
to
wait
until
the
regulation
has
been
applied
to
his
particular
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
an
agency
that
was
otherwise
required
to
do
so
did
not
consult
or
took
action
that
would
jeopardize
a
species,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
but
again,
respondents
have
not
sued
an
action
agency,
seeking
prevent
what
they
claim
would
be
a
violation
of
the
act
by
that
agency...
the
engaging
in
a
project
in
a
foreign
country
without
the
necessary
consultation.
they've
sued
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
who
has
simply
issued
an
interpretive
regulation
stating
what
he
believes
to
be
the
content
of
the
section
7(a)(2)
requirement.
but
the...
but
the
secretary
of
the
interior
cannot
require
another
agency
to
consult
with
the
secretary
about
a
project.
so
whatever
may
be
the
case
in
a
dispute
about
a
particular
project,
which,
again,
we
don't
have
here--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
confer
a
right
of
action.
but
again,
the
article
iii
standing
requirements
would
have
to
be
met.
and
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
there
are
three
essential
standing
requirements
that,
even
under
a
citizens'
suit,
a
plaintiff
has
to
meet.
first,
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
he
has
suffered
some
actual
or
threatened
injury;
second,
he
must
show
that
that
injury
is
fairly
traceable
to
the
challenged
action;
and
third,
he
must
show
that
that
injury...
there's
a
likelihood
that
that
injury
will
be
redressed
by
a
decision
in
his
favor.
and
we've
shown
in
our
brief
that
respondents
here
satisfy
none
of
those
requirements
with
respect
to
any
of
their
members
in
foreign
countries.
respondents,
in
their
brief,
focus
on
two
of
defenders'
members
in
an
effort
to
establish
standing...
excuse
me,
focus
on
five.
the
court
of
appeals
found
standing
only
on
the
basis
of
two.
it
rejected
the
third,
mr.
plowden,
on
the
ground
that
he
hadn't
even
gotten
within
200
miles
of
the
project
in
question.
and
any
nexus
that
the
remaining
two
might
have
had
to
a
project
was
so
insubstantial
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
address
it.
so
this
case...
respondent's
standing
would
depend
entirely
on
the
ability
to
establish
that
two
members
that
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
had
standing
in
their
own
right.
and
those
two
members
fail
each
step.
these
two
are
joyce
kelly
and
amy
skilbred.
joyce
kelly's
entire
basis
for
standing
is
one
paragraph
in
an
affidavit
that
appears
at
one...
page
101
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
that...
in
her
affidavit,
joyce
kelly
makes
no
allegation
that
on
her
visit
to
the
nile
river
in
1986
she
was
harmed
at
all
in
her
viewing
of
any
endangered
species.
all
she
says
was
that
i
will
suffer
harm.
and
with
respect
to
future
injuries,
she
says
i
will
suffer
harm
as
a
result
of
u.s.
bureau
of
reclamation
assistance
in
rehabilitating
the
aswan
dam
hydroelectric
power...
power
plant.
there's
no
indication
in
her
affidavit,
or
in
the
bureau
of
reclamation
report
which
she
references,
that
that
rehabilitation
would
have
any
effect,
whatever,
on
an
endangered
species,
and
specifically,
the
nile
crocodile.
moreover,
joyce
kelly
has
not
shown
that
she
actually
has
firm
plans
to
return
to
egypt.
all
she
says
is
that
i
have
observed
the
traditional
habitat
of
the
nile
crocodile,
and
i
intend
to
do
so
again.
i
plan
to
return
to
egypt.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
she
did
not
say
when
she
intended
to
return
to
egypt.
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--she
said
that
she
had
travelled
to
egypt
in
1986.
now...
so
she
hasn't
shown
either
actual
injury
in
the
past...
she
didn't
claim
it...
or
future
injury.
because,
as
this
court
has
said,
with
respect
to
threatened
injury,
the
threat
has
to
be
real
and
immediate.
the
injury
has
to
be
certainly
impending...
which
suggests
that
any
injury
has
to
be
immediately
forthcoming.
the
sort
of
vague,
unspecific
allegation
or
assertion
that
joyce
kelly
makes
here,
that
she
intends
to
return
sometime
in
the
future,
falls
far
short
of
that
necessary
to
establish
a
concrete
threat
of
future
injury.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
first
of
all,
the
mere
fact
that
she
visited
in
the
past
is
not,
alone,
enough,
as
this
court
said
in
lyons.
if
this
was
a
damage
action,
a
past...
past
injury
may
be
relevant.
but
for
future
injunctive
relief,
the
past
injury
is
not
sufficient.
but
with
respect
to
future
injury,
we
think
at
a
minimum
there
has
to
be
a
definitive
and
concrete
plan.
and
picking
up
on
this
court's
language
that
the
threatened
injury
has
to
be
real
and
immediate,
we
think
that
the...
that
the
injury...
that
the
threatened
injury--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
injury
problem.
one
is
the
threat
that
the
agency's
project
might
have
an
effect
on
species.
but
there's
the
further
requirement
that
she,
personally,
suffer
injury.
and
if
she
doesn't
plan
to
visit
the
project
for
5
years--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
the
sort
of
injury,
yes,
that
would
be
cognizable
under
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
she
would
have
to
show
both
that
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
she
would
have
to
show,
at
least,
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
some...
of
some
adverse
impact.
that's
the
standard
that
triggers
the
consultation
requirement
in
the
first
place.
so
if
she's
relying
just
on
injury
to
the
species,
rather
than
her
use
of
the
land,
which
she's
not
alleging
here...
just
injury
to
the
species,
she
would
have
to
show
some
injury
to
the
species.
but
beyond
that,
she
would
also
have
to
show--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
she
is
the
one
who's
claiming
the
injury.
the
burden
is
on
her.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
at
least
a
likelihood
of
injury,
we
submit.
and
again,
the...
under
this
court's
standing
doctrine,
the
court
has
reiterated
just
last
term,
the
court
presumes
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
unless
it
affirmatively
appears
in
the
record,
and
it's
up
to
the
person
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
show
the
injury.
so
in
this
case,
she
has
to
show
some
injury.
and
a
risk
to
animals
does
not
translate
into
injury
to
a
human
being.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
she
would.
she
would
have
to
show
that
if
she
was
challenging
the
project
itself...
again,
she's
challenging
a
regulation,
which
is
even
one
more
step
removed.
but
assuming
she
was
challenging
the
regulation...
i
mean
the
project...
she
would
have
to
show
that
the
injury
is
fairly
traceable
to
the
bureau
of
reclamation's
assistance,
and
would
be
likely
to
be
cured
by
either
a
withdrawal
of
the
assistance
or
consultation,
or
at
least
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
assistance.
and
that
she
can't
show,
both
because
the
bureau
of
reclamation
is
an
independent
actor.
but
beyond
that,
we
have
here
foreign
sovereigns
who
have
it
within
their
own
power,
as
respondents
concede,
to
go
forward
or
not
to
go
forward,
to
seek
funding
from
other
sources.
so...
but
going
back
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that's
correct.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
with
amy
skilbred,
with
respect
to
the
mahaweli
project.
she
hasn't
brought
this
suit
to
try
to
enjoin
the...
u.s.
aid
from
furnishing
assistance
to
the
mahaweli
project.
she's
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
an
interpretive
regulation...
or
the
respondent
organizations
have.
and
they
have
used
these
two
projects
as
being
illustrative
of
the
sort
of
projects
that
the
u.s.
may
engage
in
overseas.
but
the
fact
that
the
respondents
have
challenged
the
secretary's
regulation,
and
the
court
entertained
the
suit
in
that
context,
really
converts
the
court
of
appeals'
disagreement
with
the
secretary's
interpretation
into
nothing
more
than
an
advisory
opinion.
because
these
respondents
do
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
it
would.
and
in
fact,
when
it
comes
to
the
actions
of
a
foreign
country,
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
she
could
not
show
that,
for
reasons
derived
from
this
court's
act
of
state
and
political
question
doctrines.
a
u.s.
court
should
not
presume
to
decide
and
receive
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
a
foreign
sovereign
is
likely
or
not
likely
to
undertake
a
project
on
its
own
soil
with...
seeking
other
foreign
assistance.
but
beyond
that,
under
this...
under
this
court's
decisions
in
allen
v.
wright
and
simon
v.
eastern
kentucky
welfare,
even
in
a
wholly
domestic
context,
the
court
has
made
clear
that,
at
the
very
least,
the
plaintiff
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
actions
of
a
third
party
are
so
likely
to
happen
that
the
injury
will
be
redressed
by
the
relief.
and
respondents
have
fallen
wholly
short
in
this
case
of
showing
that.
in
fact,
this
is
a
particularly
improbable
case
for
making
such
a
showing.
the
mahaweli
project...
the
u.s.
government
has
furnished
less
than
10
percent
of
the
overall
assistance
to
that
project.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
sorry.
it's
in
sri
lanka
on
the
mahaweli
river
in
sri
lanka.
so...
and
again,
amy
skilbred
did
not
allege
that
she
suffered
any
injury
with...
on
her
visit
to
sri
lanka
and
her
ability
to
view
wildlife
back
in
1981.
and
she
also
said
in
her
deposition,
at
pages
65
to
67,
that
she
had
no
concrete
plans
to
return.
she
said
she
hoped
to
return
some
day,
but
she
had
no
concrete
plans.
again,
the
requirement
of
a
threatened
injury...
going
back
to
justice
stevens'
question...
is
not
just
the
threat
that
the
agency's
action
will
have
some
impact
on
species,
but
also
that
she,
personally,
will
suffer
the
injury
which,
at
the
very
least,
requires
a
showing
that
the
visit
to
the
foreign
project
is
imminent,
and
therefore
that
the
injury
is
imminent.
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
position
that
the
respondent
organizations
do
not
have
standing
in
this
case,
it
would
then
be
necessary
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
scope,
geographic
scope,
of
section
7(a)(2).
in
our...
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
seriously
erred
in
its
resolution
of
the
merits,
as
well.
this
court
reiterated--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
possible
that
that
could
arise,
if...
for
example,
if
there
was
a
project
undertaken
directly
by
the
foreign
government...
i
mean,
excuse
me...
by
the
u.s.
agency,
not
a
foreign
government,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
for
example,
a
u.s.
constructed
project
in
a
foreign
country,
and
a
plaintiff
showed
the
requisite
personal
injury,
actual
injury.
then,
just
as
in
the
teleco
dam
case
in
a
domestic
project,
we
think
it's
possible
that
a
plaintiff
would
have
standing.
so
this...
our
position
here
does
not
rule
out
that
possibility.
but
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
the
project
is
undertaken
by
the
foreign
government,
only
with
the
financial
assistance
of
the
u.s.
government,
we
think
that
the
elements
of
causation
and
redressability
are
far
too
attenuated.
but
on
the
merits,
the
court
reiterated
just
last
term
in
the
aramco
case,
that
it's
an
established
principle
of
american
law
that
acts
of
congress
are
presumed
not
to
apply
in
foreign
countries,
absent
an
affirmative
intention
of
congress
to
the
contrary
that
has
been
clearly
expressed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
same
position.
it's
outside...
it's
outside
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
no
foreign
country.
now,
we
had
taken
the
position
that
the
consultation
requirement
applies
on
the
high
seas.
i...
let
me
correct
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
we've
taken
a
position
on
whether
it
would
apply
in
antarctica.
i
know
i've
taken
the
position
that
nepa
does
not
apply
there,
so
i
would
assume
that
we
would
take
the
same
position
here.
but
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
have.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
not...
and
of
course,
that's
not
in
issue
here.
but
we
think
that
some
support
for
that
can
be
obtained
from
what
is
the
closely
parallel
provision
of
the
act
that
governs
the
taking
of
endangered
species.
the
section
9(a)(1)
of
the
act
prohibits
the
taking
of
protected
species
by
a
person
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
either
when
it's
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states,
or
on
the
high
seas.
but
conspicuously
absent,
missing
from
the
statute,
is
any
prohibition
against
the
taking
of
a
species
in
a
foreign
country,
presumably
because
the
regulation
of
the
taking
of
species
in
a
foreign
country
would
be
something
that
would
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
that
country,
which
was
something
that
the
cites,
the
convention
on
international
trade
in
endangered
species,
makes
clear,
that
the
trade--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
antarctica,
but
in
terms
of
the
general
proposition,
in
foreign
countries
there
would
be
such
law.
and
on
the
high
seas,
there's
no
governing
law,
and
therefore
no
direct
conflict
with
the
controlling
law
of
another
sovereign.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
in
the
judicial
review
provisions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
consultation
provisions.
but
that
falls
far
short
of
suggesting
that
it
covers
actions
in
foreign
countries.
again,
this
ties
into
the
position
that
it
could
apply
in
territories--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
secretary...
the
secretary
initially
took
the
position
in
1978
regulations
that
it
did.
but
that
position
was
greatly
objected
to
by
the
state
department,
defense
department,
and
others.
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
promptly
ordered
a
reconsideration
of
that
in
1979.
and
that
official
position
of
the
interior
department
was
reversed
in
1981.
and
then
in
nine...
in
these
1986
regulations,
that
new
position
was
stated.
now,
under
chevron,
that
agency
position
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference.
and
it
is
not...
it
does
not
fatally
undermine
that
position
that
the
secretary
changed
positions.
he
had
good
reasons
for
doing
so.
one
thing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
what...
the
opinion
itself
states
that
the
precipitating
factor
or
the
basis
in
the
statutory
text
was
the
1978
amendments
to
the
endangered
species
act,
which
simply
reconfirmed
the
domestic
focus
of
section
7.
section
7
as
originally
passed
referred
only
to
affected
states.
in
1978,
congress
adopted
an
elaborate
exemption
provision
to
allow
for
projects
to
go
forward,
notwithstanding
the
strict,
substantive
standard
in
section
7.
and
those
elaborate
exemption
provisions,
themselves,
have
a
domestic
focus,
by
providing
for
a
representative
of
an
affected
state
on
the
endangered
species
committee,
by
providing
for
notification
to
the
governor
of
the
affected
state,
but
not
the
foreign
countries.
but
again,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
reference
to
the
state,
if
any,
in
which
the
action
occurs,
is
certainly
far
less
compelling,
frankly,
than
the
alien
exemption
under
title
vii
in
last
term's
aramco
case.
and
yet
the
court
found
that
to
be...
to
be
insufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption
that
the
act
does
not
apply.
again,
the
burden
is
on
the
respondents
in
this
case
to
show
that
congress
affirmatively
intended
the
act
to
apply
overseas.
they've
pointed
to
nothing
in
the
text
of
section
7
or
7(a)(2),
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
7(a)(2),
and
nothing
in
the
background
of
the
conventions
that
the
endangered
act
was
designed
to
implement,
to
support
the
contention
that
congress
specifically
intended
section
7(a)(2)
to
apply
overseas.
that,
in
our
view,
is
the
end
of
the
matter,
as
it
was
in
aramco
because
an
affirmative
indication
is
required.
but
even--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
there's
no
indication
that
congress
was
aware
of
that
interpretation.
and
again,
given
the
presumption,
it
has
to
be
congress,
itself,
that
affirmatively
chooses
to
extend--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
this
court
has,
on
occasion,
looked
to
that
fact.
but
particularly
in
this
context,
where
there's
no
affirmative
indication,
at
all,
that
congress
was
aware
of
it,
much
less
that
it
wanted
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
know
that
it's
a
presumption
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
legal
presumption
that
operates
here.
there
is
an
assumption,
i
guess,
in
certain
situations.
but
i
think
that
that...
that
that
background
is
simply
not
involved
here.
the
respondents
rely
on
a
passage
in
the
conference
report
on
the
1978
amendments,
for
example,
that
refer
to
the
conferees'
decision
to
retain
language
in
the
senate
bill.
well,
what
the
senate
bill
was
proposing
to
delete,
that
the
conference
report
language
refers
to,
was
the
whole
reference
to
consultation
between
agencies
and
the
secretaries.
well,
that's...
that...
that
perhaps
inadvertent
deletion
of
the
whole
consultation
process
is
something
quite
different
from
suggesting
that
congress
intended
to
apply
this
specific
provision
of
the
act
overseas.
again,
the
reference
in
section
7(a)(2)
of
the
act,
itself,
to
affected
states,
gives
that
section...
gives
that
sentence
a
domestic
focus.
and
respondents
here,
are
trying
to
make
the
improbably
argument
that
congress,
in
another
portion
of
the
very
same
sentence
intended
the
agency's
obligations
to
have
a
vastly
different
geographic
reach,
since
the
critical
habitat
portion
of
that
sentence
concededly
does
not
apply
in
foreign
countries.
yet,
they're
arguing
that
the
protection
for
the
species,
themselves,
the
species
that
would
use
that
habitat,
does
apply
in
foreign
countries.
it's
also
important
to
point
out
the
practical
difficulties
and
serious
interference
with
foreign
relations
that
would
result
from
applying
section
7(a)(2)
in
this
setting.
and
those
are
concerns
that
were
discussed
recently
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
aramco
last
term...
which
even
though
disagreed
with
a
particular
presumption
in
that
case,
acknowledged
that
where
an
act
would
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
the
nation's
foreign
relations
and
diplomacy,
the
act
should
not
be
presumed
to
apply.
and
that
is
directly
true
here.
because
a
rigid...
an
application
of
section
7's
rigid,
substantive
standard,
and
elaborate
domestically
focused
procedural
provisions
to
projects
in
foreign
countries,
would
interfere
with
the
flexibility
and
responsiveness
of
american
foreign
policy.
after
all,
foreign
aid
is...
does
not
stand
in
isolation.
it's
part
of
a
broader
diplomatic
initiative.
and
the
application
of
7(a)(2)
would
interfere
with
those
initiatives.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
several
points.
first
on
the
question
of
standing,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
did
not
take
the
position
in
1986,
just
as
we
do
not
take
the
position
today,
that
the
interpretive
regulation
is
binding
on
other
agencies.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
6
of
our
brief,
in
which
we
say
that
the
preamble
to
the
1986
regulation
stated
that
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
performs
only,
quote,
"an
advisory
function
under
section
7.
"
close
quote,
and
that
the
action
agency
makes
the
ultimate
decision
as
to
whether
its
proposed
actions
will
comply
with
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
the...
this
is
an
interpretive
regulation.
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
respondents'
own
witnesses
in
this
case,
as
we
showed
in
our
brief,
agreed
with
us.
the
secretary
cannot
make
another
agency
consult.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
best
evidence
that
they
did
not
is
the
fact
that
respondents
have
not
pointed
to,
and
we
are
not
aware
of
a
single
instance
in
which
an...
in
which
an
agency--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--has
never
taken
the
position--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there's
an
obligation
to
consult.
and
again,
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
statutory
duty
is
mandatory.
the
question
is
whether
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
means--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
but
that's
not...
that's
different
from
saying
the
secretary's
interpretive
regulation
is
binding
on
the
agency.
whatever
binds
the
agency
is
the
statute,
itself,
not
what
the
secretary
says
about
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
would
be
entitled
to
deference
the
same
way
as
any
others.
but
from
1978
to
1986,
while
the
prior
regulation
was
in
effect,
agencies
did
not
consult
with
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
1978.
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
this
court
might
affirm
the
judgment,
the
standing
question,
with
all
respect,
has
to
be
looked
at
at
the
time
the
plaintiffs
filed
the
action
in
district
court.
the
question
is
whether
a
single,
district
court
decision
construing
the
act
would
be
followed
by
other
agencies.
and
there's
no
indication...
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be.
on
the
merits,
with
respect
to
the
listing
requirement,
justice
souter,
section
8
does
specifically
refer
to
endangered
or
threatened
species
with
respect
to
the
president's
furnishing
of
foreign
assistance.
so
the
listing
of
foreign
species
is
tied
in
both
with
respect
to
section
8
and
section
9.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
presumption,
respondents
say
it
only
applies
for
local
activities
such
as
employment.
but
we
say
that
there
is...
in
our
view,
nothing
could
be
more
local
than
the
construction
of
a
project
on
foreign
soil
by
a
foreign
government
in
matters
that
affect
that
foreign
country's
own
resources.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
section
7
applies
there.
