wouldn't
she
also
have
to
at
least
suggest
how
the
bureau's...
bureau
of
reclamation's
involvement
in
this
dam
might
hurt
the
crocodile?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
do
you
think
just
any
person
in
the...
any
citizen
in
the
country
could
bring
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
everyone's
got
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
why.
if
it
was
so
clear,
i
suppose
it
would
be
your
case.
you
wouldn't
have
to
be
talking
around
about
going
to
india
or
someplace.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
now
doing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
that
doesn't...
it
doesn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
there's...
they're
bound
to
consult.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
said
that
at
one
time,
the
secretary
took
the
position
that
the
agency
is
bound
to
consult,
if
he
has
a
regulation
that
they
have
to
consult.
you
haven't
answered
that
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
did
say
that...
you
did
say
the
secretary
has
never
taken
that
position.
