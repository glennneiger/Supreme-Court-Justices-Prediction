mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
amy
skilbred
and
the
mahaweli
project.
ms.
skilbred
is
a
defenders'
member,
and
a
professional
wildlife
biologist
who
visited
sri
lanka
in
1981
and
1982,
and
visited
the
mahaweli
project
site.
she
was
deposed,
and
at
her
deposition
she
testified
that
she
confirmed
her
visit
to
the
project
site
by
looking
at
the
aid
project
documents.
so
ms.
skilbred
went
to
the
site,
and
she
went
to
the
site
for
the
purpose
of
studying
endangered
species
and
their
habitat.
concededly,
she
didn't
see
any
endangered
species
at
the
site,
but
that's
why
she
was
there.
to
require
her
to
actually
find
the
endangered
species
is
sort
of
a
catch-22
because
if
they
were
easy
to
find,
they
wouldn't
be
endangered.
ms.
skilbred
wants
to
return.
and
in
her
deposition
she
stated
that
the
reason
that
she
could
not
return,
or
could
not
have
present
plans
to
return
to
the
mahaweli
project
was
because
there
was
an
ongoing
civil
war.
so
to
say
that
she
doesn't
have
an
intent
to
return
is
to
misstate
the
record.
she
does
intend
to
return.
she
couldn't
return
at
the
time
of
her
deposition
because
of
the
civil
war.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
she
said,
specifically,
i
can't
return
now
because
of
the
civil
war.
and
in
answer
to
the
question,
and
for
what
purpose
would
you
like
to
go
back
to
sri
lanka
to
visit
the
mahaweli
project,
she
answered,
i'd
rather
go
back
to
visit
the
wildlife
that
live
in
the
area
of
the
mahaweli
project.
she
did
not
have
a
plane
ticket.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
one
of
the
deponents,
steven
schroer
had
a
plane
ticket,
and
had
a
passport.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
no,
sir,
they
did
not.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
i'd
respectfully
offer
the
following
proposition:
the
eighth
circuit
sustained
the
organization's
standing.
we
won
below,
and
any
grounds
that
can
be
used
to
sustain
the
verdict
below,
ought
to
be
used
by
this
court.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
we
can
invoke
any
individual,
so
long
as
there
was
an
adequate
record
before
the
district
court.
and
mr.
schroer's
deposition,
like
ms.
skilbred's
deposition,
was
lodged
with
the
district
court.
with
regard
to
the
mahaweli
project--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--schroer
was
to
visit
a
world
bank
project,
i
believe
in
thailand,
and
had
a
ticket
to
thailand,
and
had
a
passport
at
the
time
of
his
deposition.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
no,
but
the
treasury
department
funds
the
world
bank.
the
treasury...
and
the
statute,
section
7,
deals
with
any
agency
action
that
authorized
funds
or
carries
out
a
project.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
we
disagree
that
it
is
an
interpretive
regulation.
and,
indeed,
when
the
interior
department
published
the
regulation,
in
the
preamble
to
the
regulation
in
the
federal
register,
the
interior
department
took
the
position
that
the
regulation
was
binding
on
other
federal
agencies.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
it
doesn't
before
this
court.
but
there's
nothing
published
in
any
new
preamble,
or
in
any
new
regulations.
but
the
position
that
they
took
in
the
preamble
to
the
'86
regulation,
and
it's...
and
the
proposed
rule,
was
that
it
was
a
regulation
that
was
binding
on
all
of
the
federal
agencies,
in
response
to
the
specific
suggestion
by
other
agencies
that
the
interior
department
ought
to
make
these
nonbinding
guidelines.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
interior
department
is
given
authority
in
both
sections
4
and
7
of
the
regulations
to
publish
rules
implementing
the
statute.
and
the
position
that
the
interior
department
took
in
the
preamble
to
its
1986
regulations
and
the
proposed
regulations,
was
that
that's
specifically
what
it
was
doing.
it
was
implementing
the
statute,
and
it
was
given
that
authority
by
the
congress.
that's
the
department's
position.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
that's--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--that's
a
correct
statement.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
what--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--well,
let
me
address
that.
the
first
answer
to
that
is
that
the
secretary's
position
is
that
the
rules
are
legally
binding.
the
second
answer
to
that
is
right
now,
the
secretary
refuses
to
consult--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--it
gives...
we
are
not
required
to
address
every
aspect
of
our
injury.
by
getting
the
secretary
to
change
the
regulation,
we,
for
the
first
time
in
a
number
of
years,
make
consultation
available
to
the
agencies.
right
now,
the
secretary
has
published
a
refusal
to
consult.
the
secretary
is,
in
essence,
a
scofflaw,
and
says
i'm
not
going
to
result...
i'm
not
going
to
consult,
and
has
done
so
formally.
so
the
regulation
is
a
harm,
because
the
consultation
service
is
not
available
to
the
other
federal
agencies.
that's
a
harm.
the
second
harm
is
that
so
long
as
the
consultation
service
is
not
available
to
the
other
agencies,
nobody's
going
to
consult.
and
nobody
now
does
consult.
and
species
are
at
risk
because
the
one--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--the
initial
reason
that
nobody
consults
today
is
that
the
service
is
not
available,
because
the
secretary,
by
regulation,
refuses
to
make
it
available.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
well,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
the
whole
government
refusing
to
comply
with
the
statute--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--i
agree
that
we
have
that
means
of
challenging
the
project.
in
addition,
we
are
challenging
the
secretary's
position
in
a
way
that
such
agency
decisions
has
been
challenged
since
abbott
laboratories.
and
we
had
the
same
kind
of
a
situation
here
that
the
court
had
in
abbott
laboratories.
we
have
a
legal
construction
of
a
statute.
we
have
a
final
regulation,
which
you
didn't
have
in
lujan
v.
national
wildlife
federation.
there's
nothing
else
that
can
be
brought
to
the
party
to
help
with
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
there
is
ongoing
harm...
that
is,
the
consultation
process,
which
is
the
remedy
that
the
congress
enacted
to
solve
the
problem
of
extinction,
is
not
in
place.
so
while
we
can
sue,
with
regard
to
a
specific
project,
we've
chosen
this
route.
and
this
route
has
been
sanctioned
in
abbott
laboratores;
this
route
was
sanctioned
months
before
we
filed
this
civil
action
in
the
japanese
whaling
v.
american
cetacean
case,
which
defenders
and
hsus
were
plaintiffs
in.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
i
hope
i'm
not
wasting
your
time.
there
is
a
chance
that
the
agencies
will
not
consult
if
this
court
affirms
the
eighth
circuit.
that's
a
fact.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
i
said
there
was
a
chance.
i
think
it's
extremely
unlikely.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
justice...
i
would
assume
that,
if
this
court
rules,
that's
the
end
of
the
subject.
the
secretary
will
issue
a
regulation,
the
agencies
will
comply
with
the
regulation,
the
secretary
will
begin
to
consult,
and
endangered
species
will
begin
to
be
protected
worldwide
like
the
statute
requires.
as
to
whether
there
is
a
possibility
on
the
outskirts
of
reality
that
the
agencies
won't
comply,
the
answer
to
that
is
there
is
a
possibility.
but
it
is
extremely
unlikely.
i'd
like
to
talk
for
a
minute
about
the
statute.
the
statute
that's
at
issue
is
essentially
the
fourth
iteration
of
the
endangered
species
act.
there
was
an
iteration
issued
in
'66,
an
iteration
issued
in
'69.
the
iteration
in
'69
created
a
listing
process.
and
under
the
'69
statutes,
species
throughout
the
world
were
listed.
so
that
in
1973,
congress
was
writing
against
an
endangered
species
act
that
listed
species
throughout
the
world.
the
1973
act,
in
section
2,
the
congress
recognizes
that
the
u.s.
has
pledged
itself
as
a
sovereign
state
in
the
international
community,
to
conserve
various
species
of
wildlife.
section
4,
which
deals
with
the
listing
of
the
species,
requires
that
both
foreign
and
domestic
species
are
listed.
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
the
secretary
lists
foreign
species.
section
7(a)(2),
which
is
at
issue,
and
which
was
written
against
the
backdrop
of
the
1969
endangered
species
act
which
listed
species
worldwide,
says
each
federal
agency...
it
doesn't
say
each
federal
agency
except
the
state
department...
shall
consult
with
the
secretary
to
ensure
that
any
agency
action...
and
it
doesn't
say
any
agency
action
in
the
united
states...
funded
or
carried
out
as
not
likely
to
jeopardize
the
continued
existence
of
any
endangered
or
threatened
species.
it
doesn't
say
any
endangered
or
threatened
species
in
the
united
states.
but
again,
that
section,
in
'73
when
it
was
passed,
was
passed
against
a
backdrop
of
listing
of
all
species,
both
here
and
abroad.
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1978,
and
that's
why
i
said
that
there
were
essentially
four
versions
of
the
act
that
we're
talking
about,
the
secretary's
position
was
that
section
7
applied
worldwide.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
yes,
sir.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
guidelines
were
published
before
the
1977
and
'78
regulations.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
yes,
sir.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
'70...
the
regulations
that
went
into
effect
in
january
of
1978
made
clear
that
the
protection
of
the
act
applied
to
species
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
i
believe
they
would.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
regs...
the
1978
regulations
did
make
it
clear
that
they
were
addressing
projects
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
and
then
the
conference
report,
when
it
changes
section
7
in
1978,
the
conference
committee
says
the
conferees
felt
that
the
senate
provision,
by
retaining
existing
law,
was
preferable,
since
regulations
governing
section
7
are
now
familiar
to
most
federal
agencies.
so
the
conferees
were
aware
specifically
of
the
section
7
regulations.
and
the
section
7
regulations
had
been
published
in
january
of
1978
and
had
talked
about
this
debate,
and
said
we're
going
to
apply
the
regulations
worldwide.
so
one
can
presume
that
the
conferees
knew
of
the
debate
when
they
restructured
section
7,
and
said
we're
not
changing
the
section
7
law.
and
when
they
changed
section
7,
and
they
provided
for
judicial
review,
from
the
consultation
process...
as
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
they
provided
for
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
when
you
can't
sue
in
any
other
circuit.
and
section
7
provides
for
review
by
the
secretary
of
state.
it
provides
for
national
security
review.
the
secretary's
reading
reads
out
half
of
the
endangered
species
that
are
listed.
so
the
secretary,
in
making
this
so-called
interpretive
regulation,
isn't
tinkering
with
the
edges
of
the
statute.
he
isn't
interstitially
filling
in
gaps
within
the
statute.
he's
taking
the
language
in
section
7,
which
is
broadly
based...
any
and
all...
and
he's
cutting
out
half
of
the
endangered
species.
with
regard
to
the
contention
that
the
citizens'
suit
provision
does
not
apply,
section
a
of
the
citizens'
suit
provision
says
any
person
may
commence
a
civil
action
on
his
own
behalf
to
enjoin
any
person,
including
the
u.s.
and
agencies
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
this
chapter.
the
secretary
is
in
violation
of
the
duty
to
consult
because
he
has
publicly
affirmed
the
fact
that
he
refuses
to
consult.
the
secretary
is
in
violation
of
the
duty
to
publish
legal
regulations.
and
in
the
court
below,
we
alleged
that
the
secretary
had
an
affirmative
duty
to
ensure
that
programs
can
serve
endangered
species.
his
regulation
does
not
meet
the
obligations
of
that
affirmative
duty.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
yes.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
well,
that
is
not
our
case.
but
the
statute
creates
a
heritage--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--well,
we
had
a
member
who
went
to
mahaweli
at
sri
lanka,
and
it
was...
why
push
the
edges
of
the
standing
envelope?
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
i'll
move
on.
[laughter]
moving
right
along--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--yes,
sir.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
section
8
provides
for
assistance
programs
to
foreign
nations.
so
the
listing
doesn't
come
into
play
with
regard
to
section
8.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
no,
but
it
does
to
9.
so
your
argument
works
with
regard
to
section
9.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
section
9
provides
a
series
of
prohibitions
about
taking
species
outside
the
u.s.,
about
engaging
in
international
trade
outside
the
u.s.--
my
answer
to
the
argument,
though,
is
section
9
shows
you
that
when
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
statute
to
the
united
states
or
to
the
high
seas,
or
to
the
united
states,
the
high
seas,
and
a
foreign
country,
it
did
so
in
the
structure
of
section
9.
in
section
7,
they
use
all-encompassing
language...
any
agency
action,
any
endangered
species.
so
the
lesson
that
i
draw
from
section
9
is
different
than
the
one
that
you
proposed.
with
regard
to
the
foley,
aramco
line
of
cases,
it's
our
position
that
they
don't
apply.
we're
dealing
with
our
money,
in
washington,
d.c.,
right
down
the
street,
and
our
agencies.
and
the
agencies
are
born
of
congress.
so
it
really
isn't
a
question
of
an
extraterritorial
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
if
we're
going
to
spend
our
money,
it
does.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
it
is
a
response,
but
if
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
action
decision
being
made,
it
is
more
of
a
united
states
action
decision
than
it
is
a
sri
lankan
action
decision.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
consultation
process...
and
the
congress
has
found
that
the
interaction
that
results
in
the
consultation
process
saves
species.
if
we're
putting
up
10
percent
of
the
money,
our
interaction
with
the
sri
lankan
government
may
very
well
affect
those
species.
and
there
is
support
in
the
record
for
that
contention,
in
a
couple
of
places.
a
couple
of
the
deponents,
including
dr.
elliott
mcclure,
who
was
an
expert
in
the
area,
testified
that
he
had
seen
the
consultation
process
work.
the
aid
documents,
below
in
the
record,
indicate
the
mahaweli
project
could
harm
endangered
species,
and
that
the
sri
lankan
government
wants
our
input
to
avoid
that
harm.
so
the
consultation
process,
at
least
with
regard
to
the
mahaweli
project,
is
made
for
the
situation.
the
other
differences
between
this
case
and
the
foley,
aramco
line
of
cases
are
that
this
act
explicitly
was
intended
to
implement
treaties.
if
you
assume
that
the
foley,
aramco
line
of
cases
did
come
into
play
to
begin
with,
those
cases
deal
with
labor
and
employment.
and
you
can
say,
well,
those
are
labor
and
employment
cases,
but
labor
and
employment
is
historically
a
local
concern.
the
environment
is
not
a
local
concern.
and
the
congress
recognizes
it
both
in
the
preamble
to
this
statute,
and
the
preamble
to
numerous
other
environmental
statutes.
and
in
this
case,
unlike
the
foley,
aramco
line
of
cases,
we
believe
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face.
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
it
isn't,
doesn't
change
the
clarity
of
the
statute.
with
regard
to
the
general
issue
of
standing,
we
have
a
citizens'
suit
provision.
so
this
case
is
different
than
the
federation
v.
lujan
case.
we
have
a
final
agency
action,
which
everybody
admits
that
is
a
final
agency
action.
so
this
case,
unlike
the
federation-lujan
case,
is...
presents
the
issue
clearly
and
squarely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
the
answer
to
your
question
is--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
you
would
not
have
standing.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
thank
you.
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
is,
the
secretary
takes
the
position
that
the
regulation
is
legally
binding,
and
the
secretary
has
the
support
for
that
position
in
the
statute.
the
statute
delegates
to
the
secretary
a
rule-making
authority
with
regard
to
the
endangered
species
act
both
in
sections
4
and
7
of
the
endangered
species
act.
that's
the
first
reason.
the
second
reason
is--
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
--that's
correct.
and
that's
the
secretary's
position,
at
least
in
the
preamble
to
the
regulations.
it
isn't
today,
because
it
isn't
convenient
today.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
that
is
correct.
but
the
form
of
the...
because
the
secretary
has
abdicated
his
responsibility
for
a
number
of
years
and
has
told
the
world
don't
consult,
and
the
consultation
process
has
essentially
laid
waste
for
a
number
of
years,
it
is
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court
judge
to
tailor
a
remedy
for
that
wrong.
and
he
has
done
that.
and
the
nature
of
the
remedy,
the
district
court
remedy,
which
is
publish
new
rules,
is
not
before
this
court.
nobody
has
argued
about
it.
in
addition,
what
is...
right
now,
what
is
the
impediment
to
there
being
any
consultation?
the
first
roadblock
that
needs
to
be
removed
is
the
secretary's
refusal
to
consult.
if
we
were
to
go
to
an
action
agency
and
sue
them
and
say
you
didn't
consult
with
regard
to
the
mahaweli
project
in
sri
lanka,
they
would
say
we
can't
consult
because
the
secretary
refuses
to
consult.
so
this
is
roadblock
number
one.
and
roadblock
number
one
is
a
final,
agency
action.
the
secretary
has
taken
the
position
that
it's
a
mandatory
regulation.
and
the
secretary
has
created
an
additional
harm
by
going
out
and
distributing
the
line
to
the
other
federal
agencies
that
consultation
isn't
required.
the
consultation
process
has
lied
fallow.
and
species
continue
to
be
extinguished,
as
the
result
of
the
u.s.
projects
overseas.
that's
why
i
think
it's
different
than
new
york
and...
was
it
indiana
or
illinois?
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
i'm
going
to
see
if
there
are
any
more
in
my
outline.
[laughter]
if
those
are
the
ones
i
remember,
they've
got
to
be
the
best
ones.
and
larson
v.
valente
says
we
don't
need
to
cure
every
single
injury.
with
regard
to
the
standing
fight,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
there's
a
citizens'
suit,
if
you
look
at
it
from
a
common
sense
perspective,
what
else
would
another
procedural
posture
bring
to
this
case
and
the
resolution
of
this
issue?
nothing.
there's
the
regulation
and
the
statute.
and
in
this
case,
the
regulation
is
either
in
violation
of
the
statute,
or
it
isn't
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
and
in
this
case,
i
believe
we
meet
them,
because
ms.
skilbred
who
went
to
he
site,
who
intends
to
go
back
to
the
site.
the
argument...
and
i
say
this
facetiously...
but
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
about
what
kind
of
intention
you
need
to
go
back
to
the
site,
in
essence
requires
us
to
camp
out
at
the
site,
in
order
to
have
standing.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
well,
it
wasn't
a
visit
10
years
ago
when
we
started
the
civil
action.
the
civil
action
is
5
years
old...
5
years.
she
uses
the
resource,
professionally,
and
she
intended
to
go
back.
but
we
have
different
kinds
of
use.
dr.
elliott
mcclure,
for
example,
studied
asian
elephants.
now,
he's
never
been
to
the
mahaweli
project,
but
the
mahaweli
project
is
extinguishing
asian
elephants
from
the
face
of
the
earth.
there's
an
animal
nexus
between
dr.
mcclure
and
the
elephant.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
he's
studied
them
in
places
other
than
the
mahaweli
area
of
sri
lanka.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
then
i'll
go
back
to
ms.
skilbred,
who,
by
the
way
is
here,
and
who,
in
the
last
2
days
getting
ready
for
this,
i've
deeply
fallen
in
love
with
because
she
went
to
the
mahaweli
project.
but
they
would
require
us
to
camp
out
at
the
site.
and
in
all
honesty,
we
don't
believe
this
court's
decision
require
us
to
camp
out
at
the
site.
if
anybody
has
any
further
questions
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
them.
otherwise,
i'll
sit
down
early.
mr.
brian
b.
o'neill
thank
you,
judge.
