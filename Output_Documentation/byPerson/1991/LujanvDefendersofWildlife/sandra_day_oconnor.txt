mr.
kneedler,
how
does
the
citizens'
suit
provisions
affect
the
standing
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
it
could,
though,
provide
that
abridgement
of
the
right
that
congress
has
given
would
constitute
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
understood
the
respondents
to
argue
that
section
7(a)(2)
provides
that
each
federal
agency
shall
consult
with
the
secretary
when
action
or
funding
is
likely
to
jeopardize
the
continuation
of
an
endangered
species.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
think
that
is
the
substantive
right
that
they're
seeking
to
enforce
under
the
citizens'
suit
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
did.
do
you
think
that
the
citizens'
suit
provision
would
enable
a
citizen
to
sue
because
the...
a
federal
agency
had
failed
to
consult?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kneedler,
the
1978
amendments
presume
that
some
agency
action
will
be
taken...
will
take
place
outside
of
any
state,
and
outside
of
any
circuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
isn't
clear
that
it's
limited
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
i
think
that's
kind
of
an
odd
interpretation.
it
must
mean
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
the
secretary
take
the
position
for
some
years
that
it
did
apply
overseas?
