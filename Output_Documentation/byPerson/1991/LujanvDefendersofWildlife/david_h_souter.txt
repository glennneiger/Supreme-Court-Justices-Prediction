mr.
o'neill,
instead
of
moving
on,
could
you
move
back
just
for
a
second--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
your
point
about
the
fact
that
the
secretary's
reading
of
7
renders
irrelevant
the
listing
of
foreign
species?
isn't
an
answer
to
that
that
although
the
secretary's
reading
would,
of
course,
not...
of
section
7
would,
of
course,
render
the
listing
of
foreign
species
irrelevant
to
7,
the
listing
would
still
be
relevant
under
section
8,
with
the...
which
provides
the
obligation
of
foreign
consultation?
isn't
that
a
way
of
reconciling
the
listing
of
foreign
species
with
the
secretary's
reading
of
7?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
the
listing
has
no
reference
to
8?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
