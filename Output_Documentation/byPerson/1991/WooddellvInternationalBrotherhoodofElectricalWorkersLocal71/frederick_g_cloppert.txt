mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
section
301
of
taft-hartley,
specifically
the
provisions
for
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
any
such
labor
organization
and
its
applications
to
union
constitutions
in
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
that
is
correct.
it
was
before
this
court
came
down
with
the
terry
decision.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
of
the
law
in
union
constitutions
is
important.
in
1947,
at
the
time
the
taft-hartley
was
passed,
a
union
constitution
defined
two
separate
types
of
relationships.
it
defined
a
relationship
between
the
international
union
and
a
member,
and
it
defined
a
relationship
between
the
international
union
and
its
subordinate
bodies,
the
local
unions,
and
so
forth.
and
in
both
instances,
these
relationships
were
considered
a
contract.
so
11
years
later,
in
gonzales,
this
court
looked
at
a
union
constitution.
at
that
time
a
member
had
been
discharged
from
the
union.
he
brought
a
breach
of
contract
suit
in
california,
and
the
contract
being
the
union
constitution.
the
issue
came
up,
well,
was
this
preempted?
should
these
issues
be
federalized?
and
the
court
at
that
time
said
no,
that
issue
should
not
be
federalized.
the
next
year
in
1959,
congress
enacted
the
first
comprehensive
regulation
of
the
internal
affairs
of
unions
in
the
landrum-griffin
act.
there,
for
the
first
time,
was
mentioned
union
constitutions
and
any
kind
of
regulation
of
union
constitutions.
approximately
12
years
later,
in
lockridge,
this
court
revisited
gonzales,
essentially
the
same
issue,
the
union
constitution
breach
of
state...
breach
of
contract
in
state
court.
and
because
there
was
impacted
the
union
security
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
court
in
lockridge
held
that
there
should
be
garmon
preemption,
nlra
preemption.
but
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
lockridge
recognized
that
a
breach
of
contract
of
the
union
constitution
could
be
brought
in
state
court
except
in
this
instance
there
was
a
possible
conflict,
and
so
the
court
preempted
it.
then
10
years
later,
in
plumbers,
this
court
addressed
the
relationship
between
the
union
and
its
subordinate
bodies
in
union
constitution,
and
held
that
that
relationship
was
a
301
contract.
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
today,
because
of
a
footnote
in
plumbers.
crucial
to
deciding
this
case
is
understanding
the
nature
of
a
union
constitution.
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it's
not
an
employment
contract,
it's
not
a
lease.
a
union
constitution
is
a
charter
of
an
organization,
the
same
way
you
would
have
a
charter
of
the
ymca,
the
ywca,
the
knights
of
columbus,
or
another
organization.
parts
of
it
define
the
relationship
between
the
international
union
and
the
local
unions,
and
part
of
it
defines
the
relationship
between
the
international
union
and
the
individual
members.
so
you
have
parts
of
a
constitution
that
deal
with
a
call
to
the
convention
in
how
you
run
your
convention.
you
have
other
parts
that
deal
with
the
merger,
consolidation,
trusteeship
of
local
unions.
you
have
other
parts
that
deal
with
the
finances
of
the
international
union,
obviously
something
important
and
sacred
to
the
union.
and
it
defines
the
per
capita
that
a
local
pays
the
international
and
how
those
dues
are
to
be
allocated.
all
these
parts
of
the
constitution
go
to
that
relationship
between
the
international
union
and
the
subordinate
bodies.
there
are
other
parts
of
union
constitutions
that
define
the
relationship
between
the
union
and
its
members.
there
are
provisions
for
qualifications
for
and
admission
to
membership
as
well
as
the
admission
dues
or
initiation
fees.
there
are
provisions
that
relate
to
the
pension
plan,
to
how
many
years
a
member
must
have
to
qualify
for
death
benefits.
and
finally,
there
are
the
duties
of
the
local
union
officers
to
its
members,
and
that's
the
part
of
the
constitution
that's
at
issue
here.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
the
international
constitution
prescribes
duties
for
the
local
union
and
the
local
union
officers.
and
among
the
duties
that
are
prescribed
is
the
business
manager
shall
do
such
and
such
for
his...
the
members.
now
that,
to
me,
is
a
personal--
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
--right.
that
speaks
to
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
union,
not
to
the--
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
--those
are
the
local
union
officers.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
not
the
international--
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
--those
are
the
duties
of
the
local
unions
officers.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
and
that's
the
relationship...
that's
almost
a
third
kind
of
thing
where
you
have
a
relationship
that
i'll
get
to
later
between
the
local
union
and
its
members.
you
have
the
local
union
bylaws.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
i
see
that
as
an
obligation
in
the
constitution
that
governs
the
officer
and
the
member.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
international.
now,
if
the
member...
if
the
officer
doesn't
do
that,
that's
obviously
a
violation
of
the
international
constitution,
but
that
doesn't
express
a
relationship
between
that
officer
and
the
international
union.
we're
concerned
here
with
the
legislative
intent.
and
it's
clear
that
section
301
of
taft-hartley
has
been
discussed.
it
doesn't
talk
about
internal
union
affairs,
it
talks
about
contracts
between
any
such
labor
organizations.
and
as
this
court
saw
in
the
plumbers
case,
there
is
just
no
legislative
history
to
assist
this
court.
with
that
in
mind,
i
think
the
court
should
then
look
at
landrum-griffin,
which
was
passed
12
years
later,
that
was
the
first
comprehensive
regulation
of
the
internal
affairs
of
the
labor
unions
that
dealt
with
their
members.
in
section
103,
in
fact
in
three
sections,
it
specifically
said
that
we
do
not
preempt
preexisting
rights.
and
let
me
address
a
few
of
those
because
i
think
this
is
crucial
with
the
understanding
of
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
in
'47,
'59,
and
so
forth.
let's
look
at
what
landrum-griffin
did
as
far
as
not
preempting
preexisting
rights.
in
section
103
it
said,
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
limit
the
rights
and
remedies
of
any
member
of
the
labor
organization
under
any
state
or
federal
law,
or
before
any
court
or
other
tribunal,
or
under
the
constitution
bylaws
of
any
labor
organization.
section
403
has
essentially
the
same
provisions
relative
to
union
elections.
then
there
is
another
savings
clause
in
section
603
that
provides,
nothing
in
this
act
shall
take
away
any
right
or
bar
any
remedy
to
which
members
of
a
labor
organization
are
entitled
under
such
other
federal
law
or
law
of
any
state.
this
understanding
that
there
was
no
disturbing
the
preexisting
rights
was
also
had
by
the
commentators
at
the
time,
and
we
have
cited
professor
summers'
article
in
our
brief.
professor
summers
in
that
article
says
that
one
of
the
minor
disputes
in
landrum-griffin
during
the
congressional
debates
was
between
whether
there
would
be
a
complete
preemption
of
other
rights
or
whether
there
would
be
a
coexistence
of
rights.
and
he
said
there
occurred
a
coexistence
of
rights.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
i
have
all
that
confidence
in
the
court.
if
i
may,
justice
scalia,
we
have
a
federal
system--
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
--when
you're
dealing
with
the
individual,
those
are
individual
rights.
when
the
international
is
merging,
consolidating,
putting
into
trusteeship,
chartering,
those
are
all
rights
between
two
labor
organizations,
and
that's
what
this
court
discussed
in
plumbers.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
the
per
capita
dues,
that's
the
support
of
the
international
union--
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
--right.
it
requires
the
local
unions
to
pay
$5
per
head
to
the
international
for
the
international
support.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
i
think
our
analysis
takes
care
of
many
of
the
concerns
that
counsel
mentioned
here
of
the
law
being
different
depending
on
whether
it's
an
individual
member
bringing
the
lawsuit
or
it's
an
organization.
for
example,
let's
go
back
to
the
plumbers
case.
what
if
some
members
in
that
local
that
was
being
consolidated
in
new
jersey
brought
the
lawsuit
instead
of
the
local?
well,
you're
affecting
the
relationship
of
the
international
and
its
local,
and
that's
a
plumbers
case.
the
issue
should
not
be
who
is
bringing
the
lawsuit.
and
this
court,
you
know,
decided
that
in
smith,
that
it's
not
who's
bringing
the
lawsuit,
but
it's
the
nature
of
the
rights
or
the
nature
of
the
relationship.
and
that's
what
the
court
should
focus
on.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
the
only
way
i
can
say
it,
justice
scalia,
is
does
it
deal
with
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
the
subordinate
bodies?
and
if
it
does,
it's
a
plumbers
case.
if
it
deals...
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
its
individual
members,
that
is
an
individual
right
claim,
and
that's
something
that,
you
know...
for
example
in
gonzales,
lockridge,
except
the
court
found
a
garmon
preemption
in
lockridge...
fines
in
allis-chalmers,
the
union
sued
to
enforce
fines
in
state
court.
and
the...
under
the
union
constitution.
that's
individual
kind
of
rights.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
if
it
regulates...
right,
elections.
just
as
petitioner
has
indicated,
there
could
be
a
judicial
nightmare
if
you
would
accept
the
distinction
that
justice
scalia
and
i
have
been
discussing.
we
think
there
is
potential
for
a
great
nightmare
or
quagmire
if
you
accept
their
argument
where
you
federalize
every
claim
based
on
a
union
constitution.
most
international
unions
have
intermediate
bodies
called
district
councils.
the
state
of
kentucky
might
be
a
whole
district
council,
a
place
such
as
ohio
might
have
three
or
four
district
councils.
district
counsels
have
bylaws.
there
are
generally
5,
10,
15
local
unions
within
the
confines
of
that
district
council.
do
the
district
council
bylaws
then
become
a
301
constitution?
what
about
the
local
union
bylaws?
one
of
the
claims
in
this
case
is
not
only
for
breach
of
the
international
constitution,
but
also
for
breach
of
the
local
union.
the
constitution
of
the
ibew
provides
that
this
constitution
shall
become
a
part
of
all
local
union
bylaws.
so
then
all
the
local
union
bylaws
throughout
the
country
that
the
ibew
has,
are
they
then
considered
to
be
301
contracts
that
this
court's
going
to
be
required
to
address?
now
there
are
some
independent
local
unions
out
there.
would
the
court
look
at
the
relationship
between
that
independent
local
and
its
members?
since
there's
not
another
union
involved,
would
that
not
be
a
301
contract,
and
would
those
be
the
only
union
constitutions
that
would
be
enforceable
in
state
court?
we
also
have
the
issue
of
the
union
suing
members.
if
they're
going
to
federalize
every
claim
under
union
constitution,
then
a
claim
such
as
this
court
saw
in
allis-chalmers,
where
the
union
was
enforcing
fines
imposed
for
crossing
a
picket
line,
the
union
could
go
into
federal
court
and
enforce
all
of
those.
in
allis-chalmers
they
were
state
court
claims.
we
think
there
is
more
problems
if
the
court
makes
what
appears
to
be
a
simple
cut
and
federalizes
this
whole
thing
rather
than
making
a
determination
based
on
the
relationship.
mr.
frederick
g.
cloppert,
jr.
yes.
we
think
the
touchstone
should
be
does
it
deal
with
the
relationship
between
the
international
union
and
the
local
unions.
and
those
are
plumbers-type
cases,
those
are
301
collective
bargaining...
let's
call
them
301
collective
bargaining
contracts
because
i
want
to
distinguish
it
from
the
301...
i'm
sorry.
those
are
301
constitution
claims,
so
i
can
distinguish
it
from
the
collective
bargaining.
and
acts
that
deal
with
the
relationship
between
the
union,
whether
it's
an
international
or
local
union,
with
the
members,
those
are
claims
that
should
be
considered
in
state
court.
if
there
are
any
other
questions,
i
thank
you
for
your
time.
