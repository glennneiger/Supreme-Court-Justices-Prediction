justice
scalia
mr.
meckler,
how
do
you
distinguish
lockridge?
i
mean,
the
action
that's
alleged
to
have
occurred
here
would
certainly
be
a
violation
of
the
act
in
and
of
itself.
so
why
shouldn't
the
board
have
the
first
chance
to
pass
on
it...
the
garmon
preemption,
in
other
words?
justice
scalia
but
to
be
committed
not
as
a
contract
violation,
but
as
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
they
were
wrong
about
301
preempting
it.
justice
scalia
well,
which
of
the
two
categories
does
that
fall
into?
does
that
deal
with
the
relation
between
the
international
and
members?
justice
scalia
or
does
it
deal
with
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
its
subordinate
unions?
it
deals
with
both,
it
seems
to
me.
it
says
what
the
subordinate
unions
have
to
do
with
respect
to
the
members.
so
it
deals
with
the
members
and
it
also
deals
with
the
subordinate
unions.
so
maybe
there's
a
third
category.
justice
scalia
so
it
does
speak
to
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
union.
justice
scalia
but
it
also
speaks
to
the
duties
of
the
officers
of
the
union.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
so
therefore
it
does--
justice
scalia
--i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it
says
the
local
union
owes
a
duty
to
the
international
to
do
something
for
the
members
of
the
local
union.
right?
isn't
that
what
it
basically
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cloppert,
let
me
understand
what
your
case
is.
you're
asking
us
to
look
at
all
union
international
constitutions
and
to
divide
their
provisions
into
two
types.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
confident
that
we
can
tell
as
to
each
of
those
which
of
them
is
type
one
that
involves
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
the
local,
and
type
two,
which
involves
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
individual
members
of
the
local.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
just
let
me
add,
and
you're
confident
that
a
provision
that
says,
a
member
of
the
local
is
entitled
to
get
certain
service
from
a
vice
president
of
a
local.
that
falls
into
the
first
category...
i'm
sorry...
yes,
that
falls
into
the
first
category.
that
involves
the
relationship
between
the
inter...
no.
the
second
category,
that
involves
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
the
individual
member,
not
the
relationship
between
the
international
and
the
local.
justice
scalia
what
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
do
you
think
are
plumber-type
provisions?
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
almost
everything
in
the
constitution
is
ultimately
designed
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual
union
member.
justice
scalia
that
involves
what?
that's
type
(a)?
that's
a
plumber-type
provision.
justice
scalia
that's
an
easy
one.
i
agree
with
that.
i
can
see
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
is
your
touchstone?
is
your
touchstone
as
to
which
category
it
falls
into?
how
do
you
figure
that
out?
you
ask
yourself,
is
the
purpose
of
this
duty
that
is
imposed
on
the
local,
is
the
purpose
of
this
duty
to
benefit
a
particular
member
of
the
local?
is
that
the
criteria?
justice
scalia
what
about
a
provision
that
the
local
elections
shall
be
conducted
in
a
certain
fashion?
that's
an
individual
rights
one?
justice
scalia
was
that
an
international
in
allis-chalmers?
was
that
the
international
suing
for
the
fines?
justice
scalia
there
wasn't
always
an
interest
in
it,
of
course,
or
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
constitution.
of
course,
it
always
have
an
interest.
but
i
think
it
is
perhaps
possible
to
draw
a
line
between
those
in
which
its
interest
is
purely
a
selfish
one,
namely
i
get
$5
a
head,
for
example,
for
all
of
your
local
members,
how
much
the
international
is
entitled
to
as
membership
fees
from
the
local,
and
those
provisions
which
are
not
just
for
the
benefit
of
the
international,
but
really,
it's
the
international
being
beneficent
to
the
members
of
the
local.
you
will
treat
your
members
this
way,
that
way,
and
the
other
way.
can't
one
draw
that
distinction?
justice
scalia
give
me
an
example
of
one
that
really
is
the
hardest
to
categorize,
doesn't
fit
into
a
neat
one.
i'm
sorry,
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
guessed
that
somebody
might
ask
you.
