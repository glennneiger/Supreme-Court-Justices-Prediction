mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
this
case.
the
first
question
dealt
with
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
title
i
of
the
labor
management
relations
disclosure
act,
lmrda,
and
that
particular
issue
has
been
conceded
by
the
respondent,
and
as
a
result,
i
don't
intend
to
argue
the
merits
of
that
issue.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
most
appropriate
thing
to
do--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--well,
i
understand
that's
possible.
i
think
the
most
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
remand,
reverse
and
remand
on
that
issue.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
the
court
below
did
disagree
with
us.
i
think
there's
a...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
circuit
court
in
light
of
the
concession,
and
in
light
of
terry,
let
them
reconsider
the
issue.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
fine.
that's
what
i'll
do,
your
honor.
moving
then
to
the
second
question
presented,
which
is,
does
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
which
a
union
member
may
sue
his
union
for
violation
of
the
union
constitution.
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
words
of
the
statute
mean
something.
and
what
they
mean
is
that
a
cause
of
action
is
created
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
the
language
of
the
statute
in
pertinent
part
are
as
follows;
suits
for
violations
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
or
between
any
such
labor
organizations
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court.
the
first
question
that
must
be
answered,
of
course,
is
whether
a
union
constitution
is
a
301
contract.
and
that
question
has
been
answered
already
by
this
court
in
the
affirmative
in
the
plumbers
case.
the
second
question
which
we
then
must
move
on
to
is,
can
a
nonsignatory
to
a
301
contract
between
unions
sue
to
remedy
a
violation
of
that
contract,
and
can
they
sue
under
301.
and
in
essence,
i
think
the
court
has
also
answered
that
question
in
smith
v.
evening
news,
and
answered
it
in
the
affirmative.
admittedly,
smith
v.
evening
news
dealt
with
the
other
half
of
this
statute,
the
two
halves
being
contracts
between
a
labor
organization
and
an
employer
and
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
smith
held
that
when
we're
talking
about
contracts
between
a
labor
organization
and
an
employer,
a
nonsignatory
who
in
that
case
who
had
benefits
arising
out
of
that
contract
could
bring
suit
against
the
employer
in
that
case.
the
same
principle
is
just
as
applicable
in
this
case.
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
that
suggests
any
basis
for
differentiation
in
the
treatment
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
the
first
type
of
statute...
excuse
me,
the
first
type
of
contract
defined
in
this
statute,
and
union
constitutions,
the
second
type
of
contract
defined
in
this
statute.
now
the
smith
court
made
it
clear
that
the
between
language
in
the
statute,
that
is
between,
in
this
case,
any
labor
organizations
referred
to
contracts
and
not
suits.
the
statute
is
very
open-ended
in
its
language.
it
says,
suits
for
violations
of
contracts
between
any
such
labor
organizations
may
be
brought
in
district
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
claim
that
there
is
a
violation
of
one
of
these
types
of
contracts.
therefore,
a
cause
of
action,
a
federal
cause
of
action,
exists
to
remedy
that
violation.
now
there
are
a
number
of
policy
reasons
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
lend
weight
to
our
position
in
addition
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
clear,
plumbers,
which
is
clear,
and
smith
v.
evening
news,
which
is
also
clear.
what
are
some
of
these
policy
reasons
to
hold
that
union
members
may
bring
suit
under
301
against
their
union
for
violation
of
union
constitutions?
first
of
all,
it's
been
long
determined
by
this
court
that
when
we
are
in
the
area
of
301,
301
contracts,
that
substantive
federal
law
must
apply.
that
was
this
court's
determination
way
back
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
and
a
long
line
of
precedent
following
lincoln
mills.
and
there's
good
reason
for
that,
particularly
in
this
context,
because
of
the
uniformity
that
applying
federal
substantive
law
brings
to
the
process.
uniformity
in
the
context
of
the
enforcement
of
a
301
contract,
in
this
case
a
union
constitution,
brings
to
us
predictability,
it
brings
to
us
labor
stability.
it's
far
better
from
a
policy
perspective
to
have
decisions
made
on
interpretations
of
union
constitutions
which
may
apply
to
as
many
as
all
50
states,
and
in
this
instance,
in
this
case
it
does,
to
be
determined
by
a
uniform
policy
of
federal
law
rather
than
determined
by
50
different
state
courts.
if
it
were
determined
by
50
different
state
courts,
we
could
have
many
different
interpretations
and
we
would
be
creating
chaos.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
lincoln
mills
concept
is
to
do
just
the
opposite
of
that.
now
in
addition,
the
application
of
federal
labor
law
principles
should
not
depend
on
who
happens
to
file
suit.
there
are
different...
if
that
were
to
occur,
and
certainly
under
plumbers,
a
local
union
has
the
right
to
sue
an
international
union
on
a
union
constitution,
an
international
union
has
the
right
to
sue
a
local
union
on
a
union
constitution
under
301.
if
that
were
to
occur,
and
individual
members
were
not
permitted
the
right
to
sue
under
301
on
this
situation,
we
would
end
up
with
different
meanings
for
the
same
constitutional
provision
depending
upon
who
happened
to
sue.
that
would
also
lead,
i'm
sure,
to
forum
shopping,
which
is
something
that
we
should
try
to
avoid.
and
it
would
lead
to
uncertainty
and
lack
of
predictability
and
a
destruction
of
labor
stability.
now
another
policy
consideration
that
i
think
the
court
should
look
to
is
the
fact
that
oftentimes
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
lmrda
claims,
and
that
certainly,
in
this
instance
it's
the
same
situation...
lmrda
claims
are
intertwined
with
claims
of
a
breach
of
a
union
constitution.
frequently,
in
lmrda
claims,
the
question
of
constitutional
interpretation,
interpreting
the
union
constitution,
comes
up
in
many
instances.
the
courts
have
always
assumed
that
in
rendering
that
interpretation,
they
must
look
to
federal
law
to
make
a
determination.
now
if
we're
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action
in
this
context,
are
we
going
to
have
claims
involving
intertwined
claims
of
lmrda
violations,
union
constitution
violations,
whereby
on
some
of
those
provisions,
in
some
instances
the
court
makes
a
determination
based
on
federal
law,
yet
on
the
same
constitutional
provisions,
the
court
makes
a
determination
based
upon
state
law?
it
seems
to
me
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
yes,
i
think
it
did.
and
i
say
that
because--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--well,
it
seems
to
me
the
evidence,
the
main
basis
of
evidence
in
that
regard
is
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
and
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
very
open,
very
open-ended.
it
says
if
one
of
these
301
contracts
is
violated,
then
there
shall
be
a
federal
cause
of
action.
now,
had
congress
chosen
to
exclude
some
type
of
301
contract,
or
what
is
now
a
301
contract,
from
that
scheme
of
things,
it
could
have
easily
chosen
some
language
to
do
so.
it
did
not.
it
left
it
very
open-ended.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
i
suppose
that's
true,
but
as
the
court
looked
at
in
plumbers,
the...
it's
very
clear
that
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
section
301
back
in
1947,
union
constitutions
were
the
primary
form
of
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
and
it
was
well
established
at
that
time
that
union
constitutions
were
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
congress
chose
those
very
words.
that
choice
of
words,
it
seems
to
me,
suggests
congressional
intent--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
principal
thing.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
i
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
chose
the
language
that
it
chose
in
section
301.
and
i
might
add
there
is
some
additional
evidence
of
that
in
the
statutory
language
itself,
and
that
is
section
(1)(b)
of
the
act,
29
u.s.c.
141(b),
where
congress
is
talking
about
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
indicates
that
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
protect
the
right
of
individual
employees
in
their
relations
with
labor
organizations.
now,
the
document
that
defines
relations
with
labor
organizations
of
individual
employees,
the
most
likely
document,
at
least,
is
a
union
constitution.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
certainly
evidence
in
the
legislation
itself
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
include
these
types
of
disputes.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
i
think
there's
a
question
there,
to
be
sure,
but
the
question
is
a
federal
question.
the
question
of
whether
there
is
some
benefit
that's
included
in
the
constitution
from
which
the
plaintiff
derives
some
benefit,
some
term
in
the
constitution--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--i
believe
that
probably
falls
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
of
course,
here
we're
here
on
a
union
constitution,
and
this
court
has
already
decided
that
a
union
constitution
is
a
301
contract.
the
type
of
contract
that
your
honor
refers
to
certainly
hasn't
been
decided
by
this
court
yet.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
i
distinguish
lockridge
on
a
couple
basis.
first
of
all,
i
think
lockridge
in
fact
supports
our
argument
in
one
respect,
and
that
is
that
it
suggests
that
matters
such
as
this
are
matters
that
are
to
be
committed
to
the
federal
branch
of
government,
not
the
state
branch
of
government.
in
that
case,
of
course,
it
was
the
nlrb,
not
the
federal
courts.
but
the
difference
in
lockridge,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--well,
yes,
that's
true,
but
i
think
the
important
thing
there
is
that
the
court
indicated
that
it's
a
matter
of
federal
concern.
now
that's
point
number
one.
point
number
two
is
lockridge
preceded
plumbers.
i
believe
that
plumbers
changes
the
landscape
because
plumbers
tells
us
that
a
union
constitution
is
a
301
contract.
now
lockridge
never
considered
the
question
of
301
at
all,
never
considered
whether
a
union
constitution
was
a
301
contract.
now
we
know
that
it
is.
and
from
that
point
of
view,
i
would
have
to
distinguish
lockridge
on
that
basis.
but
i
think
lockridge
in
some
respects
supports
our
position.
another
point
or
policy
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
idea
of
judicial
efficiency...
it
seems
a
far
better
practice
for
a
plaintiff
in
such
a
case
to
litigate
the
issues
all
in
one
forum
rather
than
in
two
different
forums.
finally,
i
think
we
need
to
have
a
remedy
here.
we
have
a
union
constitution
which
is
the
basic
document
defining
the
rights
of
union
members,
vis-a-vis
their
union.
and
it's
violated,
at
least
plaintiffs...
petitioners
claim
it's
violated.
and
the
circuit
court
tells
us
there's
no
remedy
for
that
violation.
they
tell
us
on
the
one
hand
that
there's
no
state
contract
claim
because
301
preempts
it.
they
tell
us
on
the
other
hand
that
there's
no
301
claim.
there
has
to
be
a
remedy
for
this
kind
of
a
contractual
violation.
otherwise
the
union
constitutions
aren't
worth
the
paper
they're
written
on,
the
protections
that
they
may
afford
union
members
are
worthless.
and
as
this
case
stands
here
before
the
court
today,
there
is
no
remedy.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
maybe
they
were.
i
don't
understand
logically
their
inference
there.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
301
itself,
it's
clear
that
301
includes
this
type
of
dispute.
301,
as
i
said,
the
words
of
301...
as
your
honor
was
talking
about
earlier
in
some
of
the
arguments
this
morning,
the
words
of
301
i
think
are
the
key
to
this
case.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
no.
nor
does
it
mention
a
suit
between
an
individual
member
or
employee
and
a
employer.
nor
does
it
mention
a
suit
between
an
individual
member
and
a
union.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
it
does
mention
a
suit...
well,
it
talks
about...
no,
your
honor,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
there.
it
mentions
a
contract
between
two
unions,
and
it
says
that
suits
may
be
brought
for
violations
of
such
contracts.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
no,
it
talks
about
contracts
between
two
or
more
labor
organizations,
i
think,
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
and
the
point
being
this
court
has
already
decided,
in
plumbers,
that
union
constitutions
are
that
kind
of
a
contract,
are
a
301
contract.
therefore,
it
becomes
a
matter
of
301
concern,
it
becomes
a
matter
of
federal
concern,
federal
courts'
concern.
there
are
benefits
flowing,
obviously
benefits
flowing--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--i
don't
think
so.
i
mean
i
think
that
if
it
did
not
mention
that
language,
then
plumbers
never
would
have
happened
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
probably.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
because
the
statutory
language
defines
the
bounds
here.
and
the
bounds
include
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
and
contracts
between
labor
organizations,
by
definition
now,
include
union
constitutions.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
it
doesn't
mention
contracts
between
a
union
and
a
member,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
union
constitution
is
a
contract
between
labor
organizations
by
virtue
of
its
usage
over
years,
and
more
importantly
by
virtue
of
plumbers.
that's
what
plumbers
tells
us.
i
think
i'm
going
to
conclude
my
argument
at
this
point
and
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
touch
on
a
few
points.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
about
provisions
relating
to
governing
union
elections.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
type
of
provision
that
the
interest
flows
in
all
sorts
of
different
ways.
i
think
the
international
has
an
interest
in
local
unions'
elections
being
conducted
properly.
certainly
the
local
itself
has
an
interest
in
that.
certainly
the
members
themselves
have
an
interest
in
that.
it
goes
all
three
ways
there.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
i
think
you're
going
to
get
into
all
sorts
of
problems
drawing
those
distinctions,
number
one.
number
two,
when
we
have
a
union
constitution
and
we
know
it's
a
301
contract,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
federal
question
what
those
categories
are,
if
in
fact
we
can
make
those
kinds
of
categorizations,
and
i
don't
think
you
can.
because
things
don't
fit
into
neat
labels
here.
let
me
also
point
out,
and--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--well,
okay,
and
i
probably
should.
let
me
try
to
clear
my
mind
a
second
and
think
of
one.
i
can
think
of
one
where
there's
a
provision
in
a
local...
in
a
constitution,
that
requires
before
a
referendum
vote
is
held,
before
a
referendum
vote
is
held,
a
mail
ballot
referendum
vote,
that
the
local
must
conduct
a
meeting.
the
members
must
discuss
the
issue
and
vote
on
whether
or
not
that
referendum
vote
should
be
authorized.
okay?
it
seems
to
me
if
the
local
were
then
to
go
ahead
and
conduct
a
referendum
for
whatever
reasons
contrary
to
that
provision,
that
local
members
would
certainly
have
an
interest
in
that.
certainly
the
local
itself
would
have
a
clear
interest
in
that.
and
the
international
which
would
want
its
local
to
be
run
according
to
one,
the
written
constitution,
and
two,
in
an
appropriate
manner,
would
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
that.
i
litigated
a
similar
case
like
that,
and
that
happens.
that
kind
of
stuff
happens
all
the
time.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
situation
shows
us
how
unworkable
these
kinds
of
categorizations
are.
let
me
just
make
another
point
as
far
as
that
goes.
it
seems
that
the
proposition
put
forth
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
directly
in
contradiction
to
smith.
because
what
smith
tells
us
is
there's
you
know,
there's
lots
of
different
provisions
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
too.
some
of
them
may
flow
directly
to
the
union,
between
the
union
and
the
company.
some
of
them
may
flow
to
the
individual
employee.
in
smith,
the
court
found
that
the
provisions
in
question
flew...
i
mean
flowed,
excuse
me,
to
the
individual
employee.
now
they're
suggesting
that
if
they
flow
to
the
individual
employee,
there's
no
federal
cause
of
action;
if
they
don't
flow
to
the
individual
employee,
then
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
smith
says
just
the
opposite.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
it
seems
to
me
plumbers
answers
the
question
and
tells
us
that
union
constitutions
are
contracts
within
the
meaning
of
301.
and
i
think,
as
i
understand
your
question,
justice
stevens,
it
really
goes
to
the
dissent
that
you
wrote
in
that
very
case.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
that's
correct,
although
i
think
the
question
presented
here
is
a
little
more
limited
than
that,
really.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
there.
you
know,
justice
stevens--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
i'm
not
sure...
you
mean
like
an
independent
local?
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
well,
i
think
you
probably
fall
outside
the
language
of
the
statute
because
we've
got
to
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute
says
between
labor
organizations.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
that's
right.
there
are,
to
just
answer
your
question
about,
you
know,
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
plenty
of
provisions
in
constitutions
that
clearly
do
have
effects
on
interstate
commerce.
for
example,
provisions,
i
know
like
in
the
teamsters'
constitution,
there's
provisions
that
govern
the
ratification
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
obviously
those
are
going
to
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
there's
provisions
that
govern
hiring
halls
in
this
constitution
and
many
other
constitutions.
those
certainly
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and,
you
know,
this
court
has
recognized
many
cases
in
the
context
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
boca-type
cases
in
the
context
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
where
i
suppose
an
argument
could
be
made
that
they
really
don't
have
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
we're
generally
talking
in
the
garden
variety
boca-type
case
of
a
discharge
of
one
individual.
that's
generally
what
we're
talking
about.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
works
both
ways
with
both
constitutions
and
collective
bargaining
agreements,
we
have
to
treat
them
the
same
way.
if
there
are
some
things
in
there
that
aren't
quite
as
wide
in
their
reach
and
what
happens
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
they're
brought
in
anyhow.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
that's
true.
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
we're
not
going
to
a
contract
between
a
union
and
a
member.
we're
going
to
a
union
constitution,
which
plumbers
has
told
us
is
a
contract--
mr.
theodore
e.
meckler
--well,
i
go
back,
to
answer
your
question,
justice
white,
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
which
talks
about
the
between
language,
which
smith
addressed,
modifies
contracts
and
not
suits.
it's
suits
for
violations
of
contracts
between
these
various
entities.
and...
i
think
i've
answered
your
question.
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
