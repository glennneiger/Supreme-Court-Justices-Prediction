justice
white
do
you
want
us
to
rule
on
it?
justice
white
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
both
of
you?
justice
white
hold
it,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
you.
justice
white
does
301
mention
a
suit
between
a
union
and
a
member?
justice
white
it
does
mention
a
suit
between
two
unions.
justice
white
exactly.
but
it
doesn't
mention
a
contract
between
a
union
and
a
member.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
301
didn't
mention
contracts
between
two
or
more
labor
organizations?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
yeah,
but
it
still
doesn't
mention
contracts
between
a
union
and
a
member.
justice
white
you
do
concede
the
jury
trial
issue?
justice
white
although
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
your
favor?
justice
white
that's
before
terry?
justice
white
--i
grant
you
plumbers
said
that
there
could
be
a
suit
on
a
contract
between
two
unions
and
that
union
constitutions
are
contracts.
but
the
only
kind
of
a
suit
that
301
authorized
with
respect
to
union
constitutions
was
a
suit
on
a
contract
between
two
unions.
justice
white
well,
it
didn't
mention
a
suit
on
a
contract
between
a
union
and
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
it
is
a
contract,
but
call
it
a
constitution
or
a
contract...
and
it
is
a
contract,
plumbers
held
that,
but
301
doesn't
authorize
a
suit
on
a
contract
between
a
union
and
its
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
case
is
wooddell
against
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers,
no.90-967
and
here,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
again,
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
