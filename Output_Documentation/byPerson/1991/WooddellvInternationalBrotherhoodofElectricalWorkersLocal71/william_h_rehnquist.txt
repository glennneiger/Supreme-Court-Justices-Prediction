we'll
hear
argument
now
in
case
no.
90-967,
guy
wooddell,
jr.
v.
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers.
mr.
meckler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
that
we're
wanting
to
deal
right
now
with
the
argument
before
this
court.
i
think
you'd
be
quite
justified
in
saying
that
you
submit
that
matter
on
your
brief
and
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
congress
has
chosen
to
indicate
a
federal
policy,
such
as
justice
o'connor
was
inquiring
about,
to
federalize,
they
could
have
equally
well
done
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
the
principal
thing
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
taft-hartley
act
when
it
defined
the
term
were
union
constitutions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
from
what
you
said
a
moment
ago,
maybe
you
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
meckler.
mr.
cloppert,
we
will
now
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cloppert.
mr.
meckler,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
meckler.
the
case
is
submitted.
