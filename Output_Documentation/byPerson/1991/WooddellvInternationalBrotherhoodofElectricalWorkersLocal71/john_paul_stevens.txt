justice
stevens
yes,
but
smith
was...
when
you're
talking
about
collective
bargaining
agreements,
you
kind
of
have
a
presumption
based
on
the
whole
history
of
labor
law
that
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
have
an
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
i'm
not
sure
the
same
presumption
applies
to
every
provision
of
every
union
constitution,
or
every
contract
between
two
unions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
goes
to
positions
being
rejected.
that's
right.
but
i
think
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
that
dissent
would
be
much
stronger
in
case
like
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
have
been
talked
about
where
it's
more
clearly...
there's
a
much
more
clear
absence
of
legislative
history
suggesting
it.
in
other
words,
i
can
see
contracts
between
unions
resolving
jurisdictional
disputes
and
so
forth
would
fall
right
into
the
whole...
same
kind
of
federal
interest
involved
in
collective
bargaining
agreements.
but
when
you're
talking
about
leasing
arrangements,
such
as
justice
kennedy
identified,
and
some
of
these
more
or
less
minor
disputes,
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
see
the
federal
interest.
i
guess
you
argue
also
there's
a
federal
authority
to
create
common
law
in
interpreting
the
relationship
among
unions
and
their
members.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
once
you
get...
if
you
win,
then
that's
the
next
step,
obviously.
there
will
be
a
federal
common
law
in
this
whole
area
of
union
versus
member
relationships.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
limiting
your
position
to
cases
in
which
the
union
constitution
actually
defines
the
relationship
between
an
international
or
a
national
and
locals?
you
wouldn't
make
the
same
argument
if
you
just
had
a
union
which
had
no
subdivisions,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
independent
local
has
its
own
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
your
labor
organizations
are
the
parent
and
the
subsidiaries,
or
the--
