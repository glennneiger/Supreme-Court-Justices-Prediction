mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1985
when
the
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court
in
new
orleans
by
the
claimant
i
had
two
problems
i
was
facing
on
behalf
of
my
client,
nicklos
drilling
company,
and
its
insurer.
number
one
was,
of
course,
that
we
had
our
compensation
liability
to
the
claimant
who
was
our
employee.
number
two,
we
were
looking
at
a
contractual
indemnity
claim
brought
against
us
by
transco
exploration
company,
the
third
party
which
the
claimant
had
sued
in
federal
court
in
new
orleans.
and
they
had
a
hold
harmless
that
ran
in
their
favor
with
respect
to
claims
brought
by
our
employees.
i
thought
i
saw
a
way
to
resolve
both
of
those
problems
with
one
fell
swoop,
and
that
was
by
negotiating
and
funding
through
transco
a
third-party
settlement
of
mr.
cowart's
claim
arising
out
of
his
injury
that
he
sustained
in
1983,
and
thereby
not
only
concluding
our
problems
with
transco,
but
also
closing
the
books
on
the
department
of
labor's
case
with
respect
to
mr.
cowart.
and
i
looked
at
933(g)
and
i
sure
thought
that
told
me
that
i
could
do
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
do.
and
of
course
this
wasn't
the
only
case
in
which
this
had
been
done.
this
has
been
a
practice
for
many
years
for
employers
to
conclude
their
liability
through
contributing
to
third-party
settlements,
through
taking
the
benefits
of
third-party
settlements,
and
it
seems
to
me
evident
that
the
congress
has
always
recognized,
and
33(g)
is
intended
to
recognize,
that
lump
sum
settlements
of
tort
claims
against
third
parties
constitute
an
acceptable
manner
of
providing
compensation
for
injured
workers
in
lieu
of
the
workers'
compensation
scheme
where
those
remedies
are
available.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
literally
we
were
not
paying...
or,
i'm
sorry,
is
the
question
were
we
paying
compensation
benefits
at
that
time?
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
we
were
not.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
it
was
our
position
at
that
time
that
he
was
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
because
we
had
paid
him
temporary
total
disability
up
until
the
time
that
he
had
been
medically
discharged
and
released
to
return
to
work.
the
position
that--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--the
dispute
that
we
were
settling...
does
your
honor
mean
the
third-party
claim?
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
the
claimant
was
asserting
that
he
was--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--no,
sir.
the
claimant
was
asserting
that
he
was
entitled
to
additional
compensation.
it
was
his
position
that
he
had
a
scheduled
injury
that
entitled
him
to
additional
benefits
over
and
above
what
he
had
been
paid
for
temporary
total
disability.
we
resisted
that
position.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
we
resisted
it,
frankly,
primarily
because
we
wanted
to
make
the
third
party
settlement
over
here
in
the
context
of
the
lawsuit
he
brought
against
transco
and
close
this
whole
thing
out
without
having
to
deal
with
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
no,
he
was
always
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
from
the
time
he
sustained
his
injury,
his
disability
causing
injury.
the
question
was
how
much
compensation
was
he
entitled
to.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
well--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
correct
way
to
state
our
position
was
that
it
was
our
view
that
he
was
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
who
had
received
all
the
compensation
he
was
entitled
to.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
well,
i
can
accept
that--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--yes.
i
can
accept
that,
your
honor,
because
if
he's
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
we
would
have
nothing
further
to
argue
about
here.
the
compensation
claim
would
be
concluded
as
well
as
the
third-party
claim.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
well,
for
purposes
of
the--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
it
would
not
bring
up
the
issue
that
was
decided
by
the
court
below.
what
happened
was
of
course--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--i
have
no
idea.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
reason
is
that
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
is
not
always
the
employee.
for
instance
in
the
case
of
death
benefits
that
person's
survivor
would
be
the
person
entitled
to
compensation.
that
is
the
only
reason
i
can
suppose.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
that's
probably
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
any
other
explanation
to
offer
for
the
use
of
that
term.
i
never
heard
the
department
of
labor's
interpretation
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
term
person
entitled
to
compensation
until
some
time
after
the
hearing
before
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case
in
april
of
1986.
if
we
look
at
the
circular
promulgated
by
the
director
of
the
owcp
and
the
procedures
manual
which
sets
out
this
interpretation
of
the
phrase
person
entitled
to
compensation
we
see
it's
dated
may
14,
1986.
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
collier
case,
the
one
upon
which
we
relied,
was
march
10,
1986,
2
months
before
the
director
formulated
his
interpretation
that
he
later
asked
the
fifth
circuit
to
defer
to
rather
than
its
own
prior
decision.
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
is,
in
its
own
language,
that
the
wording
which
congress
used
in
33(g)(1)
and
(2)
frames
a
scheme
which
is
unmistakable
and
brutally
direct.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
have
made
it
clear
that
whether
it's
a
matter
of
deference
or
whether
it
is
a
matter
of
according
the
interpretation
that
has
been
supplied
by
an
administrative
agency
beyond
the
express
wording
of
the
statute,
the
necessary
predicate
for
that
is
that
congress
shall
not
have
addressed
the
issue,
shall
not
have
addressed
it
overtly
and
directly.
congress
must
have
been
silent
with
respect
to
the
matter.
congress
must
have
addressed
it
ambiguously.
it
seems
to
me
it's
obvious
that
congress
was
not
silent
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
what
to
do
with
the
employers'
residual
compensation
liability
when
he,
when
there
has
been
a
third-party
settlement
made
by
the
claimant.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
i
think
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
opinion,
there
are
no
exceptions
to
33(g)'s
provision
that
where
a
third-party
settlement
is
made
for
less
than
the
amount
of
compensation
entitlement--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--and
i
think
the
department
was
wrong.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
i
don't
personally
know
that.
i
have
been
told
that
the
reference
to
thousands
of
cases
which
i
have
heard
was
specifically
with
regard
to
the
toxic
tort
claims.
there
are
many
shipyard
workers,
i
understand,
who
have
been
exposed
to
asbestos
and
have
pending
third-party
claims
already
on
account
of
this
kind
of
asbestosis
which
is
latent,
hasn't
manifested
itself
in
terms
of
disability.
my
thinking
on
that
is
those
people
are
not
persons
entitled
to
compensation
because
they
are
not
yet
disabled,
and
the
definition
of
qualification
for
benefits
under
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
act
is
disability
or
death
resulting
from
injury.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
i
suppose
the
congress
could
do
that.
i
think
that
the
interpretation
here,
as
i
said,
has
its
inception
in
may
of
1986.
the
collier
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
is
totally
contrary
to
that
interpretation,
preceded
that
by
2
months.
i
think
that
the
interpretation
the
director
has
brought
forth
was
conceived
for
the
purpose
of
contesting
the
fifth
circuit's
view
on
this
matter
in
the
hopes
of,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
attempting
to
persuade
the
fifth
circuit
to
change
its
mind,
either
in
a
second
approach
to
the
case
or
in
a
rehearing
en
banc,
or
in
ultimately
bringing
it
before
this
court.
i
think
that
that
administrative
interpretation
was
a
reaction
to
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
collier,
and
this
case
is
the
vehicle
that
it
hopes
to
undo
it.
i
don't
think
the
longstanding
interpretation
that
is
2
months
younger
than
the
fifth
circuit's
original
collier
decision
is
entitled
to
deference
from
this
court.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
that's
true,
but
as
far
as
my
own
interpretation
of
it,
i
don't
see
that
33(g)
has
any
different
import
now
than
it
did--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--(2)
definitely
makes
it
clearer,
but
i
think
the
purpose
of
adding
(2)
was
to
remove
any
ambiguity
as
to
determining
how
and
in
what
manner
the
express
consent
of
the
employer
is
to
be
solicited
and
given.
i
think
when
section
(1)
was
all
that
33(g)
comprised
the
law
was
still
what
it
is
with
respect
to
this
situation
right
here,
or
already
was
what
it
is.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
they
both
require
what,
your
honor?
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
no.
the,
only
the
settlement
for
less
than
the
total
amount
of
compensation
entitlement
requires
written
approval.
with
respect
to
a
settlement
that
would
be
for
more--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--larger
settlement
or
judgment.
in
that
event
only--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
it
takes
it
away
in
any
retrospective
sense
that
you
could
go
back
and
get
back
from
him
what
you've
already
paid
to
him.
i
think
it
would
give
the
employer
the
statutory
right
to
terminate
benefits
once
the
third-party
settlement
has
been
made
without
the
employer's
consent.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
residual
liability
for
medical
benefits
even
in
the
event
of
third-party
settlements
that
are
for
more
than
the
amount
of
compensation
entitlement.
only
in
the--
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
lee
lewis,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
