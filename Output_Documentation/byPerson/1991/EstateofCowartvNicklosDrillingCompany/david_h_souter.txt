justice
souter
but
mr.
frischhertz,
didn't
congress
have
another
reference
in
mind
as
indicated
in
the
first
clause
of
sub
(2),
which
refers
specifically
to
written
approval
of
settlement
obtained
as
required
in
(1)?
justice
souter
well,
what
do
we
make
of
the
fact
that
he's
not
giving
the
brilliant
argument
now
and
the
government
has
cut
his
feet
off?
justice
souter
i
mean,
is
there
anything
left
for
us
to
defer
to?
justice
souter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
there's
anything
left
for
us
to
defer
to,
regardless
of
what's
in
the
mind
of
the
hierarchy.
justice
souter
well,
what
do
we
do
about
the
old
position?
we
don't
have
that
to
defer
to
anymore
either,
do
we.
justice
souter
excuse
me,
but
at
that
point
the
right
to
compensation
is
vested,
isn't
it,
for
those
prior
cases?
justice
souter
but
isn't
there
perhaps
an
answer
to
your
fear
just
in
the
very
text
of
subsection
(2),
because
subsection
(2)
refers
to
the
two
instances
in
which
the
employee
has
failed
to
do
something,
he
has
failed
to
get
the
approval
and
he
has
failed
to
give
notice?
it
simply
says
all
rights
to
compensation
and
medical
benefits
shall
be
terminated.
doesn't
that
by
its
own
terms
act
prospectively
so
that
it
wouldn't,
it
wouldn't
relate
back
to
those
instances
in
which
the
right
to
comp
has
already
been
determined?
justice
souter
well,
but
i
mean,
isn't
that
the,
what
the
text
suggests
should
be
the
interpretation,
and
if
so
doesn't
that
counter
your
argument
of--
justice
souter
--that
do
relate
back.
justice
souter
but
the
point
of
doing
it
was
suggested
in
a
footnote
in
the
sg's
brief
that
it
might
refer
to
future
medicals
and
it
might
refer
it,
even
though
the
settlement
was
on
its
face
more
than
the
amount
of
the
benefits,
the
net
would
be
less,
so
it
would
apply
to
that.
is
that
the
rationale
that
you
would
adopt
for
congress'
wanting
to
do
this?
justice
souter
i
mean,
you
are
then
adopting
the
suggesting
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief?
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
even
with
respect
to
future
medicals?
