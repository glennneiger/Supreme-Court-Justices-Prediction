mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
the
cowart
case
is
the
statutory
construction
of
section
33(g),
sections
1
and
2,
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
as
amended-in
1984.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
cowart's
entitlement
to
additional
compensation,
or
what
is
called
deficiency
compensation,
is
terminated
because
he
failed
to
obtain
written
permission
from
his
employer,
nicklos
drilling,
prior
to
the
settlement
of
a
third
party
claim.
the
court
is
presented
with
four
separate
issues
to
decide
in
resolving
the
cowart
case.
one
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
under
section
33.
it
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
a
person
who
is
under
an
order
of
compensation
or
a
person
who
has
been,
who
is
receiving
compensation.
the
second
issue
would
be
what
are
the
effects
of
the
1984
amendments
to
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
with
reference
to
section
33(g)(2),
which
added
a
notice
provision.
the
third
issue
would
be
whether,
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
sellman
decision
from
the
fourth
circuit,
when
an
employer
participates
in
the
settlement
process
of
the
third
party
settlement,
does
that
relieve
the
employee
of
obtaining
written
permission.
and
fourthly,
the
question
would
be
whether
mr.
cowart's
settlement
was
in
fact
for
an
amount
less
than
compensation
to
which
he
was
entitled
to.
the
court,
if
it
resolves
any
of
these
issues
in
favor
of
mr.
cowart,
would
then
have
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit.
we
can
make
short
work
of
this
case
if
we
are
to
apply
the
holding
of
sellman
in
this
particular
case.
we
can
avoid--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--that's
the
fourth
circuit
case
that
i
attached
to
my
reply
brief.
that
case
could
obviate
the
necessity
of
a
very
intensive
discussion
of
what
the
'84
amendments
meant
and
what
the
legislative
history
intended
with
regard
to
the
application
of
33(g).
the
sellman
decision
simply
stated
that
when
the
employer
participates
in
the
settlement
process
33(g)
is
not
triggered,
meaning
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
written
permission.
this
is
a
different
concept
than
the
estoppel
concept
that
was
addressed
in
the
1972
amendments.
the
court
in
sellman
simply
says
33(g)
is
inapplicable
to
the
application
of
33(f).
the
court
really
doesn't
go
far
enough,
because
if
we
resort
to
the
simple
plain
language
of
the
statute
with
regard
to
whether
permission
is
required
of
an
employer,
all
we
need
look
at
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute
states
if
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
enters
into
a
settlement
with
a
third
person,
when
we
have
an
employer
such
as
nicklos
drilling
who
not
only
waived
subrogation,
had
an
indemnification
provision,
had
a
provision
to
defend
the
third
party,
actually
funded
the
settlement,
how
can
that
be
construed
to
be
a
settlement
with
a
third
person?
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
the
settlement
is
of
a
third
party
settlement,
but
the
settlement
was
with
nicklos
drilling.
they
funded
it.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
that's
my
argument
to
the
court,
and
i
buttress
that
with
the
provisions
of
section
8(i)
of
the
act
which
provides
that
an
employee's
termination
of
compensation
can
only
be
effected
with
a
settlement
that
is
submitted
to
the
deputy
commissioner
and
is
approved
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
this
was
a
settlement
of
his
compensation
claim
with
nicklos.
this
was
a
settlement
that
circumvented
the
provisions
of
section
8(i)
of
the
act
that
specifically
reserves
to
the
deputy
commissioner
the
right
to
scrutinize
the
settlement
to
determine
whether
there
is
adequate
compensation.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
that's
what,
that's
my...
i
agree
with
the
court.
it
should
not
have
been
a
settlement
of
his
compensation
claim,
but
the
fifth
circuit,
through
its
interpretation
of
33(g),
has
held
that
it's
a
settlement
of
his
compensation
because
it
terminated
his
rights
under
section
33(f)
for
additional
compensation,
for
future
compensation.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
the
statute
says
that,
but
the
statute,
in
the
language
of
it,
states
a
third
person.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
third
person
has
to
be,
as
sellman
said,
a
situation
where
the
employer
is
not
participating
in
the
settlement.
now
this
is
in
conflict
with
the
fifth
circuit
holding.
the
fifth
circuit
held,
in
collier,
luke,
and
jackson,
that
the
waiver
of
subrogation
does
not
act
to
relieve
the
requirement
of
written
permission.
and
in
jackson
the
fifth
circuit
said
even
the
indemnification
agreement
does
not
so
act.
the
sellman
decision
is
in
direct
conflict.
i
submit
that
in
this
case--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--that
goes
to
the
interpretation
of
what
a
person
entitled
to
comp
is
and
what
the
meaning
of
the
amendments
are.
my
interpretation
that
is
submitted
is
the
same
interpretation
that
the
benefits
review
board
held
in
kahny,
in
dorsey,
in
pinell.
that
interpretation
is
that
congress
in
1984
reenacted
word
for
word
section
33(g)(1),
which
mirrors
the
prior
33(g).
that
interpretation
was
first
gave
meaning
in
o'leary,
the
o'leary
decision,
which
held
that
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
is
merely,
is
solely
a
person
who
is
either
under
an
order
of
compensation
or
who
is
currently
receiving
compensation.
congress
reenacted
word
for
word
33(g)
that
had
been
given
the
interpretation
by
the
benefits
review
board
and
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
unpublished
o'leary
decision
and
by
the
kahny
decision
in
a
unpublished
fifth
circuit
decision
that
does
have
precedential
value.
the
additional
provision
of
section
33(g)(2)
applies
to
employee,
and
in
fact
if
you
read
the
language
in
33(g)(1)
the
language
is
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
the
language
in
33(g)(2)
deviates
from
that
and
says
an
employee,
and
it
says
if
no
written
approval
of
the
settlement
is
obtained
and
filed
as
required
by
paragraph
1,
the
pre-84
statute,
or
if
the
employee
fails
to
notify
the
employer
of
any
settlement
obtained
from
or
judgment
rendered
against
a
third
person,
all
rights
to
the
compensation,
medical
benefits
under
this
chapter
shall
be
terminated,
and
then
the
language
you're
concerned
with
is
regardless
of
whether
the
employer
or
the
employer's
insurer
has
made
payments
or
acknowledged
entitlement
to
benefits
under
this
chapter.
that
section
relates
to
employees,
which
is
a
class
that
covers
all
injured
employees.
it
covers
injured
employees
who
settle
cases
for
less
than
their
amount,
for
more
than.
it
covers
injured
employees
who
are
receiving
compensation
and
who
are
not
receiving
compensation.
it
covers
employees
who
settle
for
more
than
or
less
than.
it
covers
the
entire
class,
and
it's
read
to
go
very
neatly
with
that
class
because
it
encompasses
everything.
but
section
(2)
only
requires
notice.
what
i
submit
to
the
court
is
what
congress
did
was
in
section
(1)
adopt
the
statute
as
it
was
understood
to
mean
through
a
long
string
of
cases,
of
brb
cases,
which
was
the
understanding
and
the
position
of
the
director
of
what
the
meaning
was,
and
congress
was
very
fearful
and
they
stated
in
legislative
history
of
these
quiet,
secret
settlements
where
no
notice
is
offered
to
the
employer.
so
the
employer
may
be
refusing
to
pay
compensation,
but
he
still
has
his
subrogation
rights.
he
still
has
his
credit
rights.
but
how
can
he
enforce
them?
he
can
only
enforce
them
if
he
has
notice.
this
is
specifically
a
concern
of
congress,
and
congress
enacted
this
provision
to
protect
the
employer
from
that
specific
situation.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
that's
correct.
my,
the
interpretation
that
i
submit
to
the
court
is
that
regardless
clause
refers
to
employees
who
fail
to
notify.
section
(2)
is
reiterating
in
that
first
statement,
if
no
written
approval
of
the
settlement
is
obtained
as
filed,
required
by
paragraph
(1).
it's
referencing
if
no
written
approval
is
obtained
as
stated
in
(1),
or
the
disjunctive.
in
fact
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
ruling
essentially
rewrote
this
statute
to
replace
or
with
and.
that
is
how
they
justified
the
wording
of
the
statute.
i
must
admit
that
if
i
read
this
statute
i
could
be
confused.
i
think
it
is
ambiguous.
i
think
we
have
to
give
it
judicial
interpretation.
we
have
had
the
director
who
argued
in
behalf
of
cowart
in
the
fifth
circuit
panel
rehearing
and
en
banc,
who
gave
a
brilliant
argument
as
to--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--well,
i
don't
know
if
i
want
to
answer
for
the
government.
i
think--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--it's
interesting...
of
course
we
have
acknowledged
that
deference
is
to
be
given
to
the
director
when
they
have
an
interpretation
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
it
was
my
belief
that
they
had
such
an
interpretation
before
the
fifth
circuit.
it
was
my
belief
that
they,
in
the
longshore
procedural
manual,
that
they,
that
i
attached,
the
provision
i
attached
to
my
reply
brief
clearly
states
what
their
position
was
back
in
'86,
and
they
stated
clearly
that
their
interpretation
was
a
person
entitled
to
comp
meant
someone
who
was
receiving
compensation
or
who
was
under
an
order.
now
there
is
a
very
lengthy
legislative
history
that
lends
to
that
interpretation,
and
in
fact
it
is
discussed
quite
extensively
by
this
court
in
bloomer,
and
it
goes
through
the
interpretation,
the
historical
interpretation
of
how
that
came
about.
the
historical
interpretation
starts
in
'27.
but
getting
back
to
the
question
as
to
what
do
we
do
with
the
director's
position
who
since
1977
has
followed
o'leary,
who
has
appeared
in
all
of
these
cases,
filed
briefs
even
in
the
sellman
case,
even
in
the
barger
case
that
was
consolidated
with
this
case
before
the
fifth
circuit,
and
now
appears
here
with
a
different
position,
and
for
me
to
suggest
the
reason
for
that
would,
to
dwell
into
the
mind
and
the
hierarchy
and
the
powers
that
control
the
decision
making
process--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--the
only
thing
i
suggest
is
there
are
cases
that
i
cite
in
the
reply
brief
that
suggest
that
when
an
administrative
body
changes
a
long-standing
position
and
makes
a
180
degree
reversal,
that
we
don't
give
that
new
position
the
deference,
but
if
any
deference--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--well,
i
think
you
can
interpret
the
cases
i
cited
to
say
that.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
even
rely
on
the
deference
issue.
i
think
we
can
take
and
look
to
what
congress
intended.
now
let's
think
for
a
second.
in
1984
congress
knows
that
o'leary
has
made
its
interpretation.
congress
knows
that
it
has
been
followed
consistently.
congress
knows
that
if
they
take
and
amend
the
act
to
overrule
o'leary,
that
that
will
have
an
effect
on
the
current
entitlement
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
workers
who
settled
their
cases
based
on
o'leary,
based
on
what
the
deputy
commissioners
told
them.
section
39
of
the
act
says
the
deputy
commissioner
is
to
aid
a
claimant
in
making
a
claim
and
is
to
even,
if
requested,
provide
legal
representation.
this
director
has
done
so,
and
in
1984
if
congress
amends
the
act
to
state
o'leary
is
overruled
without
a
prospective
application,
they
would
take
hundreds
of
thousands
of
injured,
disabled
workers,
widows,
and
terminate
their
compensation.
i
don't
believe
congress
intended
this.
if
congress
had
intended
that,
why
did
they
not--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--not
when
you
have
a
statutory
body
overruling
what
was
an
administrative
or
a
judicial
interpretation.
it's
a
retroactive
application
unless
this
court
finds
differently.
that's
my
general
understanding.
but
if
congress
intended
that,
why
did
they
not
state
it
in
their
legislative
history?
they
stated
in
their
legislative
history
that
they
were
specifically
overruling
judicial,
and
they
stated
they
were
overruling
washington
transit
from
this
court.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
yes.
that
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
unpublished.
congress
in
'84
even
went
so
far
as
to
specifically,
in
section
10,
overrule
an
administrative
law
judge
decision.
they
made
reference
to
the
decision.
they
said
we
are
overruling
this
by
our
construction.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
well,
if
that's
the
interpretation,
yes.
but
if
shelby
terminated--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--that's
not
the
accepted
interpretation,
because
right
now
the
administrative
law
judges
are
granting
summary
decisions
terminating
compensation--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--that
do.
they're
interpreting
shall
to
mean
upon
application
by
the
employer
it
shall
be
terminated.
that's
how
it's
being
applied.
you
have
already
granted
numerous
summary
decisions
by
the
alj.
you
have
in
those
alone,
3,000
applications
to
terminate
compensation.
so
that's
not
how
it's
being
interpreted.
let
me--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--after
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
rendered
its
decision
in
1991,
august.
they
have
had
summary
decisions
rendered--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--oh,
i
think
it's,
i
think
it's
probably
relating
only
to
the
fifth
circuit
cases.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
they
did
that
even
though.
they,
they
seized
upon
the
decision
of
the
en
banc
fifth
circuit
and
determined
that
they
were,
there
were
no
exceptions.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
i
think
they,
i
think
if
you
allow
the
fifth
circuit
decision
to
stand,
you
have
to.
exactly.
how
can
you
go
against
that
clear
decision?
it
says
there
are
no
exceptions.
but
there's
a
misunderstanding.
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
are
no
exceptions,
and
i
basically
agree
with
that,
even
if
that
was
in
o'leary.
but
there
are
no
exceptions
when
it's
a
person
entitled
to
comp,
meaning
a
person
either
receiving
benefits
or
under
an
order.
then
there
are
no
exceptions.
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
should
have
said.
but
what
they
did
is
they
rewrote
the
statute
to
conform
with
their
meaning.
they
took
the
or
in
subsection
(2)
and
made
it
into
an
and,
and
the
other
thing
they
did
was
they
rewrote,
they
wrote
out
any
settlement
out
of
the
act
and
said
section,
the
notice
requirement
only
applies
to
judgments.
then
respondents,
amicus
respondents
and
federal
respondents,
are
suggesting
to
this
court
that
if
we're
going
to
give
meaning
to
it
we
can't
write
out
settlements
because
any
settlement
is
clearly
written
in
subpart
(2),
but
what
we
can
do
is
say
any
settlement
means
only
settlements
for
more
than
what
the
employer
would
have
been
entitled
to.
and
of
course
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
clear
language
that
says
any
settlements,
meaning
settlements
for
less
than
or
more
than.
and
that
also
flies
in
the
face
of
what
is
the
forfeiture
penalty
if
you
settle
for
more
than,
unless,
and
this
brings
us
to
a
crucial
point,
unless
we
look
at
the
application
of
33(g)
to
a
determined
amount
of
compensation.
and
this
is
the
way
congress
envisioned
it
in
1959.
in
1959
when
they
amended
the
act
to
give
the
employer
not
an
election
of
remedies
but
the
employer
could
receive
compensation
and
elect
to
pursue
a
third-party
claim,
the
legislative
history
indicates,
and
it
is
cited
by
federal
respondent
in
their
brief
at
page
21,
that
there
was
this
envision
by
congress
that
the
employer
would
be
receiving
compensation
and
it
would
be
a
determined
amount.
now,
this
is
what
mobley
said
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mobley
involved,
which
is
a
recorded
case,
mobley
involved
a
decision
where
someone
with
asbestosis
was,
filed
a
third-party
suit,
had
his
claim,
settled
his
case,
but
he
was
not
currently
disabled.
he
was
not
currently
disabled.
the
court
in
mobley
says
we
don't
terminate
your
right
to
future
compensation,
we
don't
terminate
your
right
to
medicals
because
you
settled
for
an
amount
more
than
what
is
the
determined
amount
of
compensation
due.
to
have
a
clear
understanding
we
have
to
look
at
what
happened
in
'27.
in
'27
the
employer
had
to
choose
one
way
or
the
other.
he
had
to
accept
compensation,
and
if
he
did
he
assigned
his
right
to
the
employer.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
yes.
1927,
when
the
act
was
first
enacted.
in
1927
he,
the
employee
did
not
have
a
choice.
he
had
to
select
compensation,
and
if
he
accepted
compensation
he
had
to
notify
the
deputy
commission
and
he
assigned
his
right
to
the
third-party
claim
to
the
employer.
what
was
happening
is,
in
1927
to
1938
the
employer
would
pay
compensation
for
a
brief
period
of
time,
receive
the
full
assignment
of
the
rights
of
the
employee
to
the
third-party
claim,
terminate
compensation,
then
you
had
an
employee
who
was
not
receiving
compensation
and
had
no
third-party
claim.
in
1938
congress
amended
the
act
to
say
that
the
employer
would
only
receive
the
assignment
under
section
33(b)
if
there
was
an
order
of
compensation
rendered
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
that's
where
this
concept
that
the
director
had
under
an
order
compensation
first
surfaced.
there
was
an
order
of
compensation.
that
was
the
only
time
there
was
an
assignment
of
benefits
under
section
(b).
the
director
and
the
respondents
suggest
that
we
have
to
read
section
(g)
with
section
(f),
section
(g)
meaning
the
requirement
of
permission,
with
section
(f),
the
right
of
recoupment
and
credit.
and
they
say
that
we
have
to
read
that
together
and
we
have
to
give
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
and
mean
the
same
thing.
section
(f)
specifically
references
section
(b),
which
talks
about
when
the
assignment
takes
place.
if
we
read
section
(f)
with
section
(b),
the
only
time
an
assignment
takes
place
under
the
law
as
it
is
today
is
when
there
is
a
formal
order.
this
court
has
said
that
in
palace.
in
palace
the
court
has
said
that
only
under
a
formal
order
is
there
an
assignment.
and
the
respondent
suggests
that
we
must
interpret
section
(f)
and
(g)
in
the
same
light.
we
must
interpret
it
in
the
same
light
with
section
(b).
if
we
want
to
be
legalistic
and
look
at
the
clear
wording,
then
the
only
time
there
can
be
this
necessity
for
written
permission
would
be
under
a
formal
order.
but
in
'59
congress
intended
there
to
be
voluntary
payments
and
they
did
not
want
double
recovery,
and
congress,
and
this...
and
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
necessity
for
written
permission
not
just
for
a
formal
order
but
also
when
they
are
actually
paying
compensation.
this
was--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--well,
if
the
interpretation
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
given
it
is
to
be.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
i,
my
interpretation
is
that
when
you
have
a
person
receiving
compensation
under
an
order
under
section
(1)
you
need
written
permission.
under
section
(2)
if
you
are
not
receiving
compensation
voluntarily
or
if
you're
not
under
an
order,
all
you
need
is
notice,
because
it
says
you
can
either
obtain
written
approval
or
notice.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
but,
but
the
notice
clause
says
any
settlement,
so
how
can
it
be
just
for
more
than?
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
but
i
think--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--the
reading,
converting
to
an
and
would
mean
that
you
need
notice
and
written
permission.
and
i
am
saying--
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
--no,
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
you
only
need
notice
when
you
are
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
but
an
employee.
and
that
is
someone
who
is
not
receiving
compensation
benefits
or
not
under
an
order.
only
notice
is
required
when
you're
not
receiving
compensation
and
you're
not
under
an
order.
this
is
what
the
director
stated
in
their
longshore
procedural
manual.
written
permission
is
required
under
section
(1)
when
you
are
being
paid
compensation
or
you're
under
an
order.
that's
the
interpretation
i'm
advancing,
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
benefits
review
board
in
o'leary,
dorsey,
and
about
40
other
cases,
and
the
interpretation
of
the
director
up
until
february
23
of
1992.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
your
honor,
the
court
in
palace
in
1983
interpreted
section
(b),
person
entitled
to
comp,
to
mean
someone
receiving
comp
under
an
order.
congress,
mindful
of
that,
amended
'84,
in
1984,
and
refers
section
(1)
to
the
situation
where
a
person
is
entitled
to
compensation,
whether
it's
the
palace
interpretation
of
section
(b)
that
transfers
to
(f)
or
whether
includes
paying
compensation,
and
it
added
the
notice
provision.
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
committee,
the
conference
of
committee,
the
senate
bill
reflects
that
there
is
to
be
notice.
it
doesn't
state...
prior
in
the
legislative
history
it
states
something
different,
but
in
the
conference
of
committee
it
says
the
senate
bill
termination
of
liability
for
payment
of
compensation
or
medical
benefits
if
the
employee
fails
to
notify
the
employer
of
any
settlement
obtained
from
a
judgment
rendered
against
a
third
party.
in
any
case
where
the
special
fund
will
be
liable
for
payments,
the
fund
has
a
lien
on
the
proceeds.
that
clearly
shows
that
congress
wanted
to
take
and
codify
o'leary
in
(1)
and
provide
for
notice
for
employees
who
are
not
receiving
compensation.
mr.
lloyd
n.
frischhertz
thank
you.
