justice
stevens
may
i
just
at
this
point...
when
did
the
change
in
position,
this
is
actually
not
just
in
the
briefs
here,
because
i
didn't
realize
they
had
changed
their
position
in
their
brief
in
opposition
or
the
cert
stage,
but
when
did
the
alj
start
deciding
these
cases
differently?
justice
stevens
just
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
all
over
the
country?
justice
stevens
they
did
that
even
though
the
director
in
the
fifth
circuit
was,
took
the
contrary
position?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
to
be
sure
i
get
the
facts
in
my...
at
the
time
of
your
settlement
negotiations
where
you
killed
the
two
birds
with
one
stone
in
effect,
did
you,
you
were
then
not
paying
compensation
to
the
petitioner?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
you
were
not.
at
that
time,
at
the
time
you
were
engaging
in
those
negotiations,
was
it
your
position
that
he
was
or
was
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation?
justice
stevens
then
why
weren't
you
paying
it?
justice
stevens
what
was
that?
i
don't
understand
why
that's
relevant
to
the
dispute
that
you
were
settling.
justice
stevens
well,
no,
the
two
claims.
because
at
that
time
you
were,
it's
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
was
no
longer
a
person
entitled
to
any
more
compensation.
justice
stevens
that
what
he
has
lost
in
the
proceedings
now
is
this
additional
compensation.
he
hasn't
forfeited
what
you
already
paid
him,
has
he?
justice
stevens
correct.
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
had
an
inconsistence
in
your
position
then,
that
you
were
treating
him
as
a
person
not
entitled
to
compensation
for
purposes
of
your
negotiations
with
him,
but
once
you
made
your
settlement
with
the,
with
transco
he
suddenly
developed
into
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
and
therefore
lost
his
benefit...
did
i
miss
something?
justice
stevens
--i'm
not
sure
that's
the
answer
you
gave
me
a
moment
ago.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
not
for
the
reason
given
by
the
court
below.
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
under
those
facts
you'd
win
no
matter
how
we
construed
the
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
except
it
has
a
parenthesis
there,
or
the
person's
representatives.
certainly
it
didn't,
it
wouldn't
have
needed
that
parenthesis
if
that
was--
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question?
you
say
how
the
consent
was
to
be
evidenced,
but
they
both
require
written
approval.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
stevens
written
approval.
i
thought
you
said--
justice
stevens
--oh,
i
understood
you
to
say
because
it
covered
the
larger
settlement
as
well.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
just
to
get
one
thing
clear
on
the
record?
who
is
the
federal
respondent?
justice
stevens
and
is
it
correct,
i
may
not
have
read
it,
that
your
position
as
you
set
forth
in
your
brief
on
the
merits,
you
really
didn't
reveal
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition
or
your
comment
in
the
response
stage.
justice
stevens
is
one
that
you
really
reached
between
the
time
cert
was
granted
and
the
main
brief--
justice
stevens
really.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
what
about
cases
where
compensation
was
being
paid
independently
of
a
judgment?
justice
stevens
there
may
be
a
lot
of
those.
justice
stevens
and
even
on
the
ones
where
there's
a
judgment
your
position
is
different,
differs
from
that
of
the
respondent
i
think.
justice
stevens
well
then
you're
saying
the
enactment
of
(g)(2)
changed
the
meaning
of
what
was
previously
(g)
and
then
now
(g)(1),
or
at
least
arguably
did
so.
justice
stevens
so
the
language
of
(g)
wasn't
really
all
that
clear,
but
it
became
clearer
after
(g)(2)
was
added.
justice
stevens
doesn't
your
opponent
say
that
is
a
cross
reference
to
(b)
which
in
turn
is
just
someone
receiving
compensation--
justice
stevens
the
people
referred
to
in
(b)
are
all
people
receiving
compensation.
