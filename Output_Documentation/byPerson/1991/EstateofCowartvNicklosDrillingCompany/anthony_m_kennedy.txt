justice
kennedy
if
we
accepted
your
interpretation
and
benefits
were
stripped
from
claimants
who
relied
on
the
prior
agency
interpretation,
could
congress
then
go
back
and
amend
the
statute
and
restore
those
benefits?
justice
kennedy
mr.
dreeben,
is
it,
number
one,
possible
or
does
it
happen
with
any
frequency
that
there
are
more
than
one
third
person,
there
will
be
maybe
a
principal
third
person
who
has
a
potential
for
liability
but
some
very
collateral
third
persons
that
might
make
small
settlements?
does
that
ever,
does
that
occur?
justice
kennedy
and
so
settlement
with
any
one
of
those
third
persons
would,
under
your
view,
preclude,
the
unauthorized
settlement
would
preclude
obtaining
benefits
from
any
employer?
justice
kennedy
because
the
person
is
not
entitled
to
compensation?
justice
kennedy
so
then
person
entitled
to
compensation
in
some
instances
is
not
equivalent
to
employee?

the
second

91-17.
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
a
federal
statute.
it
creates
a
comprehensive
scheme
to
compensate
workers
injured
or
killed
while
employed
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
this
case
raises
questions
regarding
a
provision
of
the
act
governing
settlements
by
injured
workers
of
lawsuits
that
they
file
against
third
parties
who
may
have
been
responsible
for
the
workers'
injury.
the
act
allows
injured
workers
to
pursue
actions
against
third
parties
without
sacrificing
compensation.
the
act
provides
for
an
offset
against
the
employer's
liability
of
the
amount
received
from
a
third
party.
one
provision
of
the
act,
section
33(g),
places
limits
on
the
right
of
the
worker
to
settle
third
party
lawsuits.
the
statute
states
that
if
a
person
is
one
who
is
entitled
to
compensation
and
if
he
enters
into
a
third
party
settlement
for
an
amount
less
than
his
entitlement
under
the
act,
he
must
obtain
the
written
consent
of
the
employer
to
the
settlement
before
the
settlement
is
entered.
failure
to
do
so
results
in
termination
of
benefits
under
the
act.
it
is
uncontested
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
secure
his
employer's
written
consent.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
he
was
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
and
so,
subject
to
the
written
consent
provision.
he
argues
that
because
he
was
neither
receiving
benefits
nor
had
an
adjudication
resolved
in
his
favor
at
the
time
of
the
settlement,
he
does
not
fall
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
after
the
en
banc
court
held
that
the
petitioner
was
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
and
had
forfeited
his
right
to
benefits
thereby,
reversing
a
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
benefits
review
board.
we
hold
today
that
the
written
consent
requirement
of
section
33(g)
applies
regardless
of
whether
an
injured
worker
is
receiving
compensation
or
has
adjudicated
to
be
so
entitled.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation
and
our
analysis
is
dictated
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
employer
supported
by
the
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs,
the
government
agency
which
administers
the
act,
argues
to
us
that
the
natural
meaning
of
person
entitled
of
compensation
encompasses
persons
like
petitioners
who
have
been
injured
and
are
eligible
for
benefits
under
the
act.
we
find
great
force
in
that
argument.
in
normal
english
usage
to
be
entitled
to
something
used
to
qualify
or
have
a
right
to
it.
it
does
not
require
that
the
right
be
acknowledged
or
adjudicated.
under
that
natural
meaning,
petitioner
was
a
person
entitled
to
compensation.
our
conclusion
is
about
just
by
other
provisions
of
the
longshore
act
using
the
phrase
person
entitled
to
compensation,
many
of
which
would
make
no
sense
if
the
phrase
meant
what
the
petitioner
contends.
petitioner's
most
powerful
argument
test
is
that
we
should
adapt
his
view
because
since
1977
the
benefits
review
board
has
read
the
language
as
he
does,
and
in
1984,
congress
reenacted
the
statute
without
changing
the
critical
language.
we
disagree.
first,
as
the
petitioner
concedes,
we
owe
no
deference
to
the
views
of
the
board.
it
is
the
office
of
workman's
compensation
programs
that
is
the
agency
charged
with
administering
the
statute,
and
that
agency
now
argues
in
favor
of
the
employer.
second,
the
petitioner's
argument
is
based
on
a
false
premise.
when
congress
reenacted
the
longshore
act
in
1984,
it
added
new
provisions
and
new
language
which
we
think
leave
little
doubt
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
adapt
the
board's
view
of
the
statute
and
if
any
thing,
it
meant
to
reverse
it.
in
any
event,
administrative
interpretation
followed
by
congressional
reenactment
cannot
overcome
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
we
are
concerned
that
our
decision
today
will
have
a
harsh
effect
on
injured
workers
and
their
families
when
they
loose
their
benefits
for
failure
to
comply
with
section
33(g),
a
result
which
may
have
been
exacerbated
by
the
uncertain
course
followed
by
the
federal
agency's
charge
with
administering
the
act.
however,
congress
has
spoken
with
great
clarity
to
the
precise
issue
raised
in
this
case
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
enforce
the
judgment
of
the
legislature.
if
the
effects
of
the
law
are
to
be
alleviated,
that
too
is
within
the
province
of
the
congress.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
join.
