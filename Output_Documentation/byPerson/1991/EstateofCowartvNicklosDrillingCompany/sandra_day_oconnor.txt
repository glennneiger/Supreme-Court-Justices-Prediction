justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
frischhertz,
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
the
last
clause
of
section
933(g)(2),
which
says
that
benefits
are
forfeited
regardless
of
whether
the
employer
or
the
employer's
insurer
has
made
payments
or
acknowledged
entitlement
to
benefits
under
this
chapter?
justice
o'connor
mr.
lewis,
why
did
congress
use
the
word
employee
in
933(g)
when
it
used
the
phrase
person
entitled
to
compensation
every
place
else?
justice
o'connor
do
they
mean
the
same
thing?
and
what
is
it?
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
lewis,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
concern
expressed
by
the
petitioner
about
any
so-called
retroactive
effect
of
the
fifth
circuit's
interpretation
here?
would
you
take
the
position
that
an
employer
could
now
go
back
and
cut
off
benefits
that
are
being
received
that
under
the
new
interpretation
would
not
have
been
allowed?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
and
yet
at
the
time
that
those
actions
were
resolved
the
federal,
the
department
was
taking
a
different
view,
was
taking
the
petitioner's
view
and
were
allowing
these
additional
benefits.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
there
we
are.
now
are
we
talking
about
thousands
of
cases?
justice
o'connor
why
does
the
statute
(g)(2)
take
away
an
employee's
compensation
if
he
has
received
a
settlement
for
an
amount
greater
than
the
amount
of
benefits?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
has
the
director's
opinion
changed
in
this
matter?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
director
never
read
the
text
before,
in
the
past,
in
arguing
so
ably
in
the
lower
courts
for
the
other
view?
justice
o'connor
well,
are
you
going
to
address
the
potentially
devastating
effect
on
thousands
of
people
who
reached
settlements
at
a
time
when
the
government
was
arguing
for
their
position?
justice
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
can
you
explain
why
(g)(2)
uses
the
word
employee
but
elsewhere
in
the
statute
it's
personal,
person
entitled
to
compensation?
is
that
just
a
drafting
error?
