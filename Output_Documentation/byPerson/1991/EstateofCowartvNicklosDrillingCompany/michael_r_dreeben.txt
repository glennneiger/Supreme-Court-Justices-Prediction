mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view
there
is
only
one
issue
before
the
court
today,
and
that
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
section--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
federal
respondent
is
the
director
of
office
of
worker
compensation
programs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
department
was
revisiting
what
its
position
would
be
in
light
of
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
position
that
we
presented
in
our
merits
brief--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
allay
the
court's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
director
is
supporting
this
position
that
we're
presenting
today.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
is
within
the
department
of
labor
text.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
the
submission
that
we're
making
here
today
is
that
the
claim
in
clear
text
of
section
33
determines
the
outcome
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
of
course
the
director
read
the
text,
consulted
the
text.
in
light
of
the
rejection
of
the
director's
position
by
the
en
banc
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
further
consideration
of
it,
we
are
persuaded
that
congress
has
spoken
to
this
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
o'connor.
the
first
point
on
retroactivity
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
section
33(g)
does
not
override
principles
of
res
judicata.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
the
extent
that
a
case
has
gone
to
judgment
and
has
not
been
appealed
by
an
employer
to
a
court,
that
case
will
not
be
affected
by
the
court's
ruling
here
today.
i
think
that
would
follow
from--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
i
think
even
with
respect
to
future
medicals.
the
issue
would
become
final,
the
parties
will
have
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
it.
if
they
choose
not
to
seek
judicial
review
they
are
bound
by
a
decision
to
that
effect.
that's
the
court's
holding
in
seven
v.
pittston
coal
from
a
couple
of
terms
ago.
so
i
do
not
think
that
the
retroactive
reach
of
this
court's
decision
has
any
effect
on
final
judgments.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
cases
that,
in
which
compensation
was
being
paid
voluntarily
are
governed
by
the
statute.
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
those,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
know
what
the
respondent's
position
is
on
cases
that
have
gone
to
judgment,
but
our
position
is
that
those
cases
are
governed
by
res
judicata.
the
cases
that
have
been
alluded
to
in
petitioner's
brief,
the
thousands
of
cases,
are
primarily
occupational
disease
cases
in
which
employees
have
been
exposed
to
asbestos
or
other
disabling
materials
on
the
work
place
and
have
sought
both
third-party
recoveries
and
compensation.
in
a
lot
of
those
cases
the
third-party
claims
have
gone
forward
while
the
compensation
proceedings
have
been
stayed,
and
many
of
those
have
been
settled
by
the
employees.
our
position,
i
think
it
does
coincide
with
what
the
private
respondents
said
about
that,
many
of
those
employees
will
not
have
been
disabled
at
the
time
they
reach
their
third-party
settlement,
and
for
that
reason
in
our
view
are
not
persons
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
statute.
so
those
people
will
also
not
be
affected
by
the
court's
ruling
today.
in
addition,
we
think
that
there
are
settlements
that
will
not
be
for
more
than
the
compensation,
that
will
be
for
more
than
the
compensation
due
in
the
gross
amount
and
less
for
the,
than
the
compensation
due
in
the
net
amount.
those
settlements
also
will
not
be
affected.
so
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
there
are
many
individual
factual
questions
that
apply
in
the
so-called
thousands
of
cases
that
have
arisen,
and
it
has
been
the
director's
position
that
those
cases
should
be
held
pending
this
court's
decision,
and
then
they
should
be
resolved
on
a
case-by-case
basis
on
their
individual
facts.
we
do
not
anticipate
necessarily
that
there
are
going
to
be
thousands
of
cases
in
which
there
was
detrimental
reliance
on
the
director's
views.
in
our
view
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it's
a
closer
question,
justice
scalia,
as
to
what
the
statute
clearly
meant
prior
to
the
1984
amendments,
and
we
would
have
no
disagreement
if
this
court
concluded
that
pre-1984
the
director's
position
was
permissible,
but
in
light
of
the
1984
amendments
it
was
not
permissible.
the
1984
amendments
do
furnish
the
clearest
evidence
that
congress
intended
the
coverage
of
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
is
an
arguable
reading
of
what
congress
did,
because
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
for
a
number
of
reasons
i
think
in
fact
the
coverage
of
the
term
person
entitled
to
compensation
was
pretty
clearly
more
broad
than
the
position
that
the
director
had
taken
prior
to
1984,
but
i
would
not
disagree
with
a
reading
of
the
statute
that
said
before
1984
there
may
be
some
room
for
ambiguity.
but
there
certainly
is
no
room
for
ambiguity
after
1984.
that,
i
think
that's
a
possible
distinction
even
though
there
is
evidence
that
person
entitled
to
compensation
was
broader
before.
of
course
section
33(g)(1)
is
not
qualified
in
the
way
that
the
petitioner
has
read
it
and
the
way
that
the
board
of
benefits
review
previously
read
it.
it
states
that
if
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
settles
a
claim
against
a
third
party
for
less
than
the
longshore
act
compensation,
the
employer
is
liable
for
the
deficiency
amount
only
if
written
approval
is
obtained.
now
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
means
that
approval
is
required
only
when
the
employee
is
being
paid
benefits
by
the
employer,
either
voluntarily
or
pursuant
to
an
award.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
it
uses
the
unqualified
phrase
person
entitled
to
compensation.
and
that
phrase
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
it
is
used
at
least
twice
else
in
section
33
itself.
in
section
33(a)
congress
established
the
rule
that
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
does
not
have
to
elect
between
receiving
a
compensation
remedy
and
pursuing
a
third-party
action.
and
that
provision
is
surely
not
limited
to
an
employee
who
is
actually
receiving
compensation.
it
applies
to
anyone
who
wants
to
bring
a
third-party
suit
whether
or
not
they're
receiving
compensation.
subsection
(f)
of
section
33,
which
is
a
parallel
section
to
subsection
(g),
uses
the
introductory
phrase
if
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
institutes
proceedings,
and
it
goes
on
to
provide
the
rule
that
if
the
person
entitled
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--actually
the
cross
reference
to
(b)
doesn't
prove
that
much,
because
what
(b)
does
is
function
as
a
statute
of
limitations
provision
in
effect.
it
says
that
if
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
does
receive
benefits
and
doesn't
sue
within
6
months
the
claim
reverts
to
the
employer.
but
it
doesn't
prohibit
the
person
entitled
to
compensation
from
suing
before
receiving
benefits.
that's
what
(a)
stands
for.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
by
definition,
the
people
who
reach
the
outer
limit
of
their
right
to
sue
are
in
that
category.
but
the
people
covered
by
subsection
(f)
aren't
in
that
category.
the
benefits
review
board
has
actually
held
that
under
subsection
(f)
if
you
receive
a
third-party
recovery
as
an
employee
and
then
seek
compensation,
the
credit
rules
that
are
described
in
subsection
(f)
still
apply
even
though
you
weren't
receiving
compensation
at
the
time
you
brought
and
settled
the
third-party
action.
and
subsection
(g)
is
really
an
exception
to
the
credit
rule
of
subsection
(f).
subsection
(f)
says
the
employer
shall
be
liable
for
deficiency
compensation
in
certain
circumstances.
subsection
(g),
which
uses
the
same
phrase,
person
entitled
to
compensation,
says
the
employer
shall
not
be
liable
for
deficiency
compensation
in
certain
circumstances.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
less
than
precise
drafting
going
on
there,
justice
o'connor.
if
you
look
at
subsection
(i)
of
section
33,
which
is
reprinted
on
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
phrase
employee
is
used
in
that
section
as
well.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
anything
by
it.
in
fact
if
you
took
employee
completely
literally
in
section
(g)(2)
it
would
mean
that
if
a
survivor
obtained
a
judgment
for
more
than
the
amount
of
compensation
the
survivor
would
not
even
have
to
give
notice
to
the
employee,
the
employer,
and
that
would
make
no
sense
because
then
the
employer
would
be
entirely
deprived
of
notice
of
a
judgment
that
would
extinguish
its
compensation
liability.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
happens
most
often,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
occupational
disease
context
where
in
fact
an
employee
might
work
for
several
different
employers
and
be
exposed
to
asbestos
or
coal
dust
over
a
number
of
years
and
therefore
have
a
number
of
potential
defendants
all
of
whom
might
be
liable
for
causing
part
of
the
injury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
in
fact
the
employee
is
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
time
he
makes
the
settlement,
which
presupposes
that
the
employee
is
in
fact
disabled.
a
lot
of
these
cases
arise
before
the
employee
is
disabled
and
unable
to
work,
and
in
our
view
settlements
by
a
person
in
that
position
are
not
covered
by
the
approval
requirement
in
(g)(2).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
until
you're
disabled
you
haven't
satisfied
the
statutory
requisites
that
would
entitle
you
to
receive
compensation
if
you
went
ahead
and
applied
for
it.
if
you
apply
for
it
and
you're
not
disabled
you're
not
going
to
get
compensation.
and
i
think
that
means
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
compensation
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
employer
would
be
able
to
get
a
credit.
the
act
presupposes
that
there
would
be
no
double
recovery.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
act--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
he
eventually
becomes
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
at
the
time
that
he
seeks
longshore
act
benefits,
and
(f)
is
not
written
so
as
to
exempt
a
person
who
is
actually
entitled
to
compensation
from
the
credit
rules
of
this
section.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
has
to
go
a
little
bit
further
and
satisfy
the
requirements
of
being
disabled
and
having
a
claim
under
the
act.
an
employee,
of
course,
covers
everyone
who
works
for
the
employer.
but
i
don't
think
that
in
this
section,
33,
or
in
the
longshore
act
generally
congress
was
attempting
to
draw
that
sort
of
distinction.
the
act
uses
a
number
of
terms
to
refer
to
people
who
are
eligible
for
benefits.
it
uses
employee,
it
uses
claimant,
it
uses
person
entitled
to
compensation.
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
accretion
of
a
number
of
amendments
over
the
years
and
different
draftsmen
who
were
looking
at
the
act.
the
original
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
of
requiring
approval
was
to
protect
the
employer
against
the
possibility
that
a
settlement
might
be
for
too
little,
and
that
purpose
is
applicable
whether
or
not
the
employee
is
receiving
benefits
at
the
time
that
he
effectuates
the
settlement.
so
the
reading
of
person
entitled
to
compensation
that
the
fifth
circuit
gave
is
consistent
with
the
over-arching
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
approval
requirement.
in
fact
when
the
approval
requirement
was
first
added
to
the
original
version
of
the
statute
in
1927
because
an
employee
had
to
elect
between
receiving
compensation
and
pursuing
tort,
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
could
not
be
receiving
longshore
act
benefits
at
the
time
he
settled
the
third-party
suit.
you
had
to
bring
the
third-party
suit
at
a
time
when
you
were
not
receiving
benefits.
so
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
is
consistent
with
the
position
that
we
are
advocating
here
today.
it
is
true
that
there
are
potential
hardships
that
can
result
for
employees
under
the
reading
of
the
statute
the
fifth
circuit
gave--
thank
you.
