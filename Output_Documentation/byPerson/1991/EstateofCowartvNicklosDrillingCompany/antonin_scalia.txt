justice
scalia
very
easily.
that's
who
the
settlement
was
with.
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
mean
it's
with
them.
justice
scalia
why
was
it
a
settlement
of
his
compensation
claim?
it
wasn't
a
settlement
of
his
compensation
claim.
justice
scalia
the
statute
says
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
frischhertz,
it
seems
to
me
you're
troubled
about
the
retroactivity
portion,
but
our
usual
law
is
that
statutes
are
construed
to
be
prospective
only,
not...
judicial
decisions
are
retroactive.
it
seems
to
me
if
that's
a
problem,
you
know,
that
can
be
taken
care
of
by
interpreting
the
statute
the
way
it
should
normally
be,
prospectively.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
why
is
it
that
you
say
that
your
opponent
is
reading
subsection
(2)
so
that
it's
converting
the
or
to
an
and?
it
seems
to
me
you're
converting
the
or
to
an
and.
it
says
either
one.
justice
scalia
but
the
notice
covers
situations
other
than...
the
settlement
covered
by
paragraph
1
is
only
a
settlement
for
less
than
what
he's
entitled
to
from
the
employer.
so
you
have
to
cover
the
situation
where
the
employee
gets
recovery
or
settles
for
the
amount
he's
entitled
to
from
the
employer
or
for
more
than
that.
that's
why
you
need
the
notice
clause.
justice
scalia
well,
it...
yeah,
i
admit
it
should
have
said
any
other
settlement--
justice
scalia
--but
it
still
says
or.
it
doesn't
say
and.
your
reading
converts
it
into
an
and.
justice
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
you--
justice
scalia
well,
we
could
also
reach
the
same
result
by
refusing
to
extend
it
before
the
enactment
of
the
revised
933(g)
which
included
the
subsection
(2)
for
the
first
time,
and
that
was
1984.
so
that,
that
means
of
preventing
retroactivity
is
certainly
available,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
(2)
makes
it
clearer
than
it
was
without
(2)?
justice
scalia
just
to
finish
that
off,
you
wouldn't
make
a
distinction
between
pre
and
post-1984?
you
think
even
before
the
revision
of
subsection
(g)
the
statute
still
meant
what
you
now
say
it
means?
justice
scalia
so
if
you
collect
from
the
third
party
soon
enough
you
can
collect
from
both
him
and
the
employer?
justice
scalia
why
does
it
presuppose
that?
i
mean,
if
you're--
justice
scalia
--if
you're
still
using
it,
(f)
covers
the
person
entitled
to
compensation,
and
if
you
use
your
theory
that
you're
not
a
person
entitled
to
compensation
until
the
disability
shows
up,
if
he
gets
the
money
before
the
disability
shows
up
it
seems
to
me
he
could
keep
that
and
get
it
from
the
employer
as
well.
