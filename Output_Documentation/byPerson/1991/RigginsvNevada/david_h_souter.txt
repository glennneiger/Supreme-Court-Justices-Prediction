justice
souter
mr.
yampolsky...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
souter
i
was
going
to
say
maybe
i
missed
the
point,
but
i'm
not
sure
of
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
prior
to
seeking
the
court
order
to
terminate,
did
the
defendant
ever
say
to
his
doctors,
i
don't
want
anymore
medicine,
or
i
won't
take
it?
justice
souter
so
prior
to
his
going
into
court,
there
was
no
act
of
the
state
forcing
it
upon
him.
justice
souter
but
did
the
court
ever
go
further
than
saying
i
will
not
order
the
state
to
stop
administering
the
medication?
did,
to
put
it
another
way,
did
the
court
order
go
further
and
say
you
must
take
so
much
mellaril
a
day?
wasn't
the
court
order
of
the
former
variety?
it
simply
said
i...
in
effect,
i
won't
intervene
and
enjoin
the
administration
of
this
medication?
justice
souter
so
if
he
had
then
said,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
take
it,
he
wouldn't
be
in
violation
of
the
court
order?
would
not
have
been
in
violation
of
the
court
order.
justice
souter
well,
mr.
yampolsky,
are
you
saying
now,
in
effect,
that
the
answer
to
the
questions
that
you
have
raised
is
something
like
this:
yes,
with
appropriate
findings
of
necessity,
the
state
can
administer
these
drugs
forcibly,
even
though
it
will
compromise
what
he
would
regard
as
compromising
his
demeanor.
but
that
the
constitutional
defect
here
is
that
the
state
has
not
predicated,
or
the
court
did
not
predicate
its
order
on
adequate
findings
of
necessity.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
position
that
you
take
now?
justice
souter
all
right.
was
that
the
position
that
you
took
in
the
state
court,
or
did
you
say
in
the
state
court,
regardless
of
the
findings,
you
may
not
forcibly
administer
this
medication
under...
given
the
charges
against
him
and
his
insanity
defense?
justice
souter
excuse
me.
your
question
is
perhaps
broader
than
you
need
it
to
be,
but
you're
really
saying
that
your
position
is
comprehended
with...
or
the
issue
that
you
raise
is
comprehended
within
that
broad
statement
of
the
issue
in
the
cert
petition.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
well,
don't
you
want
to
rest
on
the
need
to
medicate
for
competence
rather
than
the
need
to
medicate
for
safety?
justice
souter
i
see.
yes,
yes.
okay.
justice
souter
i've
got
the
point.
mr.
yampolsky,
you
stated
a
moment
ago
that
the
defendant
was
in
this
listless,
disinterested...
and
i
think
in
your
brief
you
say
zombie-like
state.
is
that
a
factual
finding
below,
or
is
that
just
your
assertion?
is
there
any
finding
in
the
lower
courts
that
that
was
indeed
the
situation?
justice
souter
why...
is
that
reason
he
has
the
burden,
simply
because
he's
the
moving
party
on
the
motion?
justice
souter
well,
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
it's
not
a
good
reason,
do
you
have
another
reason?
i
mean,
do
you
take
the
position,
for
example,
that
the
state
is...
he's
in
custody,
the
state
has
a
parens
patriae
right
to
do
whatever
it
thinks
is
appropriate
for
the...
for
his
physical
or
mental
welfare?
are
you
resting
on
some
theory
like
that?
justice
souter
well,
was
that
the
equivalent
of
saying
therefore,
i
do
not
claim
that
even
at
the
risk
of
incompetency
the
medication
should
be
stopped?
i
mean,
was
that
a
way
of
saying
yes,
i
don't
go
the
whole
hog
here,
all
i'm
really
asking
for
is
an
order
to
stop
the
medication
or
reduce
the
medication
consistent
with
competency?
