justice
white
well,
certainly
the
state
knew
and
the
doctors
knew
that
he
wanted
the...
when
he
made
the
motion,
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
wanted
the
medication
stopped.
justice
white
and
they
nevertheless
continued
to
give
it
to
him.
justice
white
and
it
may
be
that
they
were
justified
in
doing
it
if
he
was
a
danger
to
himself
or
others,
and
it
was
medically
appropriate.
justice
white
well,
just
yes
or
no.
are
these
questions
you
stated
in
your
brief
the
same
questions
you
raised
on...
in
your
petition
for
cert?
yes
or
no?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
or
the
state,
the
supreme
court
in
nevada
opinion,
the
only
question
they
decided
was
that
you
didn't
have
a
constitutional...
a
special
constitutional
right
to
discontinue
these
drugs
so
that
you
could
appear
in
your
natural
state
at
trial.
and
they
said
no.
justice
white
that
was
the
only
thing
they
decided.
justice
white
right.
and
is...
the
constitutional
issue
you
want
us
to
decide
is
whether
you
have
a
special
constitutional
right
to
have
the
drugs
terminated
so
that
you
can
appear
in
your
natural
state
at
trial.
is
that
the
question?
is
that
it
or
not?
justice
white
it's
the
only
issue
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
justice
white
i
mean
the
supreme
court
decided.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
would
argue,
i
suppose,
that
even
if
in
normal
circumstances,
you
might
be
dangerous
to
yourself
or
others,
and
this
is
medically
appropriate,
you
nevertheless
should
be
able
to
refuse
the
drugs
because
you're
going
to
go
to
trial
and
you
want
to
appear
in
your
natural
state
at
trial.
justice
white
well,
the
way
you
put
it
awhile
ago,
it
sounds
to
me
like...
you
say
the
court
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
his
competence
to
treat
him.
is
that
what
the
court
decided?
justice
white
so
whose
ever
burden
it
was...
if
it
was
the
state's
burden,
you
suggest
that
the
court
found
it
was
satisfied.
justice
white
except
there
was
no--
--he
didn't
say
that,
did
he?
justice
white
he
said
the
most
prudent
course:
i
don't
want
to
take
the
risk.
justice
white
don't
want
to
take
the
risk
of
having
to
postpone
the
trial.
should
the
court
make
findings
as
to
whether
or
not
the
medication
will
affect
the
demeanor
of
the
defendant,
or
is
that
irrelevant?
justice
white
well,
i
think
it
was
raised
by
counsel,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
yeah,
but
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals...
to
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
on
the
basis
that
he
was
being
involuntarily
treated.
do
you
deny
that?
these...
that
was
the
way
the
issue
was
being
framed,
that
he
was
being
forcibly
treated.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
talked
as
though,
or
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
talked
as
though
he...
they
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
he
was
being
involuntarily
treated.
justice
white
was
he
ever...
why
was
he...
after
he
was
arrested,
wasn't
he
sent
to
a
mental
treatment
place?
was
he?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
was
there
some
question
about
his
competence
at
that
time?
justice
white
yes.
and
what
happened?
justice
white
granted
it.
justice
white
when
did
he
do...
when
was
that
entered?
justice
white
and
did
it
appear
that
the
reason
he...
did
it
appear
that
he
had
been
incompetent
but
that
the
drugs
made
him
competent?
was
that--
justice
white
--was
that
it
or
not?
justice
white
how
would
you
know
that?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it's
a...
there
didn't
sound
like
as
much
of
a
finding.
you
say,
i
just
don't
want
to
take
the
risk,
that's
sort
of
a
50/50
toss
up.
it
depends
on
who
has
to
prove
it.
justice
white
that
isn't
quite
enough
psychiatrists,
is
it?
[laughter]
nobody
said
he
would
be
competent.
some
of
them
said
he
most
likely
would
be
competent.
