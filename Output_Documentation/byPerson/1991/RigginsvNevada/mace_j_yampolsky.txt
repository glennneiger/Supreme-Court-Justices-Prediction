mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
main
issue
in
this
case
is
is
it
constitutional
for
a
state
to
forcibly
medicate
a
defendant
on
the
claim
that
he
would
become
incompetent,
when
there
is
scarcely
any
evidence
to
show
that
he
would
become
incompetent
without
the
medication,
and
when
his
best
defense
is,
in
fact
his
only
defense,
was
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
this
case
also
raises
the
related
issue
whether
it
is
constitutional
for
a
state
to
forcibly
medicate
a
capital
defendant
in
the
sentencing
phase
when
the
two
mitigating
factors
that
he
was
going
to
present
were
the
fact
that
(1)
he
suffers
from
a
mental
disease
or
defect,
and
(2)
whether
he
shows
any
remorse.
and
if
it
is
constitutional
to
forcibly
medicate
this
defendant,
did
the
state
use
the
least
restrictive
alternative
available?
david
riggins,
10
months
prior
to
the
offense,
was
found
wandering
the
street
of
glendora,
california,
in
his
underwear
at
2:00
a.m.
when
he
was
hospitalized,
he
stated
that
he
was
the
son
of
john
f.
kennedy
and
marilyn
monroe,
and
that
the
mafia
was
seeking
him
because
he
had
stock
in
ibm.
at
that
time,
he
was
diagnosed
as
paranoid
schizophrenic.
he
left
the
hospital
against
medical
advice.
ten
months
later,
he
committed
the
crime
in
the
case
before
us.
mr.
riggins
was
examined
for
competency
by
three
psychiatrists.
the
court
found
that
he
was
competent.
at
that
time,
he
was
ingesting
450
milligrams
per
day
of
mellaril.
approximately
16
weeks
prior
to
the
trial,
mr.
riggins
moved
to
terminate
the
administration
of
medication.
at
the
hearing
there
was
testimony
by
three
psychiatrists,
and
the
court,
without
any
findings,
denied
the
motion.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
justice
kennedy,
dr.
quass,
who
was
the
state's
psychiatrist,
the
prison
psychiatrist,
initially
prescribed
100
milligrams
of
mellaril
for
mr.
riggins
because
he
was
having
trouble
sleeping
and
he
was
hearing
voices.
dr.
quass
gradually
increased
the
dosage
until
it
got
to
be
800
milligrams,
which
some
psychiatrists
say
is
an
almost
toxic
dose.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
mr.
riggins
initially
asked
for
mellaril,
and
then
the
dosage
was
gradually
increased
by
dr.
quass
until
it
reached
the
800-milligram
level.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
mr.
riggins
had
requested
that
the
dosage
be
increased.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
he
went
back
to
dr.
quass,
increasing...
still
complaining
of
hearing
of
voices
and
the
fact
he
could
not
sleep.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
no,
the
increase
was
not
forced
upon
mr.
riggins.
however,
when
mr.
riggins
wanted
to
stop
the
medication,
he
was
judicially
prevented
from
stopping
the
medication.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
i
don't
believe
there
was
ever
any
finding
that
the
use
was
medically
appropriate.
in
fact,
in
the
testimony--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--the
only
time
it
was
challenged
was
at
the
hearing
of
the
motion
to
terminate
medication.
at
that
time,
according
to
dr.
quass'
testimony,
mr.
riggins
asked
for
the
mellaril,
and
he
had
the
same
problems,
so
dr.
quass
continued
the
dosage
without
ever
having
a
finding
of
what
was
medically
appropriate.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that's
correct.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
well,
at
the
hearing
for
the
termination
of
administration
of
medication,
there
was
testimony
from
dr.
quass,
who
initially
prescribed
the
medication,
drs.
o'gorman,
dr.
masters
for
the
state;
and
dr.
jurasky's
report
was
taken
into
account.
there
was
never
any
finding
by
any
judge
or
any
doctor
that
it
was
medically
appropriate.
in
fact,
dr.
master
testified
that
it
seems
like
mr.
riggin
is
groggy...
i
believe
i'm
paraphrasing,
but
he
was
closing
his
eyes,
which
could
suggest
that
perhaps
the
dosage
he
was
receiving
was
not
medically
appropriate.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
well,
according
to
this
court's
decision
in
washington
v.
harper,
there
must
be
a
finding
for
forcible
medication
that,
one,
it
was
medically
appropriate,
and
two,
that
there
was
a
finding
of
dangerousness.
in
addition,
in
washington
v.
harper,
there
was
a
procedural
set
of
circumstances
that
was
set
up
where
one
psychiatrist
would
prescribe
the
medication,
and
then
there
would
be
a
peer
review.
there
were
no
such
procedural
safeguards
in
this
case.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
the
answer
would
be
no.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that's
okay,
justice
souter.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
i
don't
believe
that
ever
happened.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that's
correct.
however,
after
the
court's
decision,
there
was
a
judicial
decision
that
forced
the
medication
upon
him
at
the
dosage
of
800
milligrams,
which
in
the
brief
of
the
american
psychiatric
association,
says
is
an
extremely
high
dose,
and
according--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--no,
the
court
order
said
the
motion
to
terminate
administration
of
medication
is
denied.
there
were
no
findings
of
facts,
no--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--i'm
unclear,
your
honor.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
i
don't
believe--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
found
competent.
however,
in
this
case,
mr.
riggins'
only
defense
was
insanity,
and
it
appeared
that
the
high
level
of
the
mellaril
would
be
counterproductive,
in
view
of
the
fact...
as
a
trial
lawyer
i
was
trying
to
show
him
in
the
natural
demeanor
as
he
was
at
the
time
of
the
crime...
the
fact
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
or
defect,
in
our
opinion,
which
was
enough
that
he
didn't
understand
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
and
he
didn't
understand
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
act.
however,
he
was
precluded
from
presenting
this
defense
by
virtue
of
the
forced
medication.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
yes,
the
court
order
said
the
motion
to
terminate
administration
of
medication
is
denied.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
apparently
not.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
correct.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that's
correct
also.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
well,
that's
correct,
however,
that
is
the
precise
issue.
there
was
never
ever
any
finding
that
he
was
a
danger
to
himself
and
others
in
the
prison
system.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that's
correct.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
well,
they
were
prescribed
by
a
doctor,
psychiatrist,
dr.
quass.
it's
unclear
from
the
hearing
what
medical
decision
making
went
into
the
process
of
elevating
the
dosage,
but
it
certainly
was
elevated.
and--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--that's
not
the
point.
however,
according
to
this--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--well,
according--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--well,
your
honor,
or
justice
scalia,
that's
the
very
question
that
needs
to
be
addressed.
was
it
medically
appropriate
for
mr.
riggins
to
be
given
800
milligrams
of
mellaril
for
him
to
be
competent
as
the
state
says.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that
is
the
question--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--well,
to
talk
about
that,
justice
scalia,
it
appears
that
we
need
to
decide,
one,
is
the
medication
forcible
because
the
judge
ordered
it
and
we
were
attempting
to
stop
it.
it
is
forcible.
and
then,
was
it
medically
appropriate.
it
does...
there's
no
finding,
absolutely
any
finding
by
a
court,
there
is
not
testimony
by
any
psychiatrist
saying
that
800
milligrams
of
mellaril
were
medically
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
your
honor,
the
medically
appropriate
issue
is
consumed
by
the
forcible
medication.
if
it
was
medically
inappropriate
that
would
be
a
separate
issue.
and
that's
what
we're
attempting
to
show
that
maybe
it
is
medically
appropriate,
maybe
it's
not.
however,
we
don't
know
from
the
record
below
us.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
your
honor,
mr.
riggins
had
been
suffering
from
paranoid
schizophrenia.
he
moved
the
court
to
terminate
the
medication.
the
court
denied
his
motion.
on
that
basis
he
was
medicated
against
his
will,
and
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
riggins'
demeanor
was
an
important
part
of
his
testimony.
as
the
trial
counsel,
an
insanity
defense
is
typically
difficult
to
win.
however,
that
was
the
only
defense
that
was
viable
in
this
case.
and
my
decision,
after
discussing
it
with
mr.
riggins,
was
that
it
would
be
in
his
best
legal
interest
to
appear
in
his
natural
demeanor.
however,
he
was
deprived
of
this
opportunity
by
virtue
of
this
ruling,
without
any
findings
that
it
would
be
medically
appropriate
to
medicate
him
because
if
we
take
him
off
he
will
be
incompetent.
that
is
a
possibility,
but
we
never
reached
that
possibility.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
if
it
was
medically
appropriate--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--and
mr.
riggins
had
the
right
to
deny
the
medically
appropriate
medication,
and
by
virtue
of
his--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--correct.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
yes,
i
would
be
arguing
that.
many
defendants
can
waive
many
constitutional
rights:
to
go
to
trial,
the
right
against
self
incrimination.
and
what's
analogous
here,
the
faretta
decision,
where
it
may
not
be
the
wisest
choice
to
act
as
one's
own
lawyer,
but
if
a
defendant
is
shown
the
pitfalls
of
possibilities,
and
he
chooses--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--i
have
two
responses
to
that.
one,
if
this
court
recognizes
the
right
to
waive
one's
competence,
then
yes.
if
this
court--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--i
believe
it
is
a
waivable
right
in
the
following
faretta
line
of
cases,
that
as
long
as
the
competent
defendant
is
given
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
which
the
pitfalls,
the
problems
which
could
occur
are
set
forth.
and
at
that
time,
if
he
is
competent
and
chose
to
waive
his
right
to
be
tried
while
competent,
i
believe
he
can.
however,
if
the
court
decides
that
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
ability
to
waive
his
right
to
be
tried
while
competent,
then
the
inquiry
must
shift
gears
to
show
well,
what
is
the
level...
the
lowest
level
which
is
appropriate...
the
lowest
level
of
mellaril
that
mr.
riggins
had
to
ingest
to
be
tried
while
competent.
because
it's
not
800
milligrams
because
the
competency
hearing...
i
say
the
hearing,
but
the
competency
decision
by
the
court
was
made
when
he
had
450
milligrams.
and
perhaps
there
would
be
a
lesser
amount,
let's
say
200
milligrams,
where
he
would
be
competent.
but
because
of
the
way
the
proceeding
below
has
taken
place,
we'll
never
know.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
we
ever
had
a
finding
on
whether
or
not
it
was
medically
appropriate.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
the
petition
for
cert
was
based
on
the
constitutional
infirmity,
or
our
position
was,
on
the
fact
that--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--yes.
they're
expanded
upon,
but
they
are
basically
the
same
questions
talking
about
the
constitutional
rights
which
were
violated
below.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
and
they
were
broken
up
in
the
questions
presented
to
the
trial
phase
and
then
resentencing
phase,
which
is
why
we
had
the
two
questions.
however,
they
encompass
the
same
due
process
right.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
and
that's
why--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--and
that's
why
we
filed
the
petition
to
this
court.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
i
don't
believe
that's
exactly
accurate.
it's
not
a
special--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--well,
it's
not
a
special
constitutional
right.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
we
believe
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right,
but
not
a
special
constitutional
right.
and
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
fair
trial--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--there's
the
fundamental
right
of
a
defendant,
which
is
being
infringed
upon
here.
of
course
the
state
has
interest
to
have...
to
try
competent
defendants.
however,
there's
another
state
interest
to
have
fair
and
accurate
verdicts.
and
it
appears
that
the
jury,
having
only
seen
mr.
riggins
in
his
calm,
remorseless,
apathetic,
disinterested
state,
was
given
the
wrong
impression
of
who
mr.
riggins
was.
it
would
have
been
better
from
a
defense
standpoint,
it
would
have
been
a
fairer
trial
if
mr.
riggins
was
able
to
display
his
natural
demeanor,
but
he
was
precluded
from
doing
so
by
the
state.
and
that
is
why
we're
here.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that
is
a
fair
statement.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
no,
we
have
never
taken
the
position
that
forcible
medication
is
always
inappropriate
and
always
constitutionally
infirm.
our
position
has
been,
in
these
circumstances,
in
view
of
this
situation,
when
an
insanity
defendant
with
the
fact
that
demeanor
is
our
most
powerful
form
of
evidence,
the
fact
that
he
was
mediated
at
such
a
high
dose
without
a
finding
of
medical
necessity
and
dangerousness,
because
of
that,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
defect.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
that's
correct.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
if
the
court
wants
to
narrow
the
issue,
it
could
be
what
would
be
constitutional
for
an
insanity
defendant.
however,
it
appears
that
the
same
constitutional
protections
that
will
protect
mr.
riggins
will
also
protect
other
criminal
defendants.
and
when
is
the
finding
of
dangerousness?
if
there
is
any
violent
crime,
could
the
court
just
say
he
was
dangerous,
he
committed
a
violent
crime,
why
don't
we
medicate
him?
and
that's
not
what
we're
here
on.
it's...
on
this
specific
set
of
facts.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
well,
this
case
wasn't
predicated
from
the
petitioner's
standpoint
on
competence.
he
was
already
adjudicated
competent
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
the
issue
is
insanity
and
how
is
he
present...
prevented
from--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--there
was
no
actual
finding.
however,
in
the
termination
hearing,
dr.
master
said
that
he,
mr.
riggins,
is
groggy
and
he's
closing
his
eyes,
and
there
was
some
colloquy
between
myself
and
the
court
pointing
to
the
fact
that
look
at
the
condition
he's
in,
how
can
i
present
this
to
a
jury.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
yes,
your
honor...
and
to...
justice
scalia.
and
to
answer
your
question,
there
were
absolutely
no
findings,
which
is
part
of
the
problem.
the
amicus
brief
by
the
american
psychiatric
association
states
that
the
effects
of
this
drug
are
to
make
one
feel...
i
mean,
make
one
appear
cold,
unfeeling,
apathetic.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
the
state's
burden
at
the
termination
hearing.
this
was
mr.
riggins'
desire
to
stop
unwanted
medication.
and
he
has
a
liberty
interest
in
stopping
unwanted
substances,
plus
it's
his
desire
to
present
his
unmedicated
demeanor
as
a
fundamental
right.
this
hearing
was
not
about
competency.
competency
was
determined,
however,
while
discussing
with
the
judge
i
submitted
what
i
believe
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
well,
if
that's
the
way
the
court
feels,
they're
worried
about
his
competence,
we
have
time
before
trial,
why
don't
we
take
him
off
the
medication
and
see.
and
the
court
denied
it.
there
were
10
weeks
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
as
it
turns
out,
there
were
16
weeks
prior
to
trial
because
of
a
conflict
i
had
in
another
case.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
correct.
this
trial
was
continued
for
6
weeks.
at
the
hearing,
i
don't
believe
i
actually
stipulated
that...
regarding
the
competence,
however,
i
did
say
well,
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
why
don't
we
try
this.
i
was
trying
to
work
out
alternatives
to
see
if
in
fact
mr.
riggins
could
be
presented
to
the
jury
in
his
unmedicated
demeanor.
and
it
was
a
reasonable
request
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
justice
scalia,
i
did
want
him
to
appear
insane,
not
incompetent.
competent
had
already
been
decided.
i
wanted
him
to
testify
about
hearing
the
voices.
maybe
on
the
stand
if
he
was
unmedicated
he
could
have
heard
the
voices,
he
could
have
had
a
colloquy
with
satan
and
satan's
assistant
so
the
jury
could
have
seen
him
so
they
could
make
that
determination
that
yes,
he
was
insane.
but
he
was
prevented
from
doing
this
due
to
the
high
dose
of
the
mellaril.
and
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
to
permit
that.
the
court
has...
the
state
has
an
interest,
and
does
the
court,
in
orderly
proceedings--
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
--i
don't
believe
the
court
has
to
permit
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mace
j.
yampolsky
it's
qualitatively
different.
here
we're
using
extraneous
outside
influences
to
show
the
manifestations
of
one's
personality.
what
we
want
to
show
are
the
actual
person,
the
manifestations
of
his
insanity,
of
his
delusions,
brought
forth
from
his
own
testimony.
