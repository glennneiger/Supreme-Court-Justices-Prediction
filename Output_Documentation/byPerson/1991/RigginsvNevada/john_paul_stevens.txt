justice
stevens
yes,
but
counsel,
regardless
of
the
reason
for
the
motion,
you
don't
challenge
the
authority
of
the
attorney
to
speak
on
behalf
of
his
client
at
that
point,
do
you?
justice
stevens
so
isn't
it
true
that
you
had
the
equivalent
of
a
statement
by
the
defendant,
i
don't
want
any
more
medication
at
this
time?
justice
stevens
maybe
the
reasons
are
different,
but
is
it
not
fair
to
say
that
he
did
at
least
request
that
the
medication
be
terminated?
justice
stevens
and
then
the
question
arises
is
who
has
the
burden
of
determining
what
facts
will
justify
continuation
of
the
medication.
you
say
it's
his
burden
to
give
reasons
for
discontinue
other
than
simply
saying
i
don't
want
any
more.
you
say
he
has
an
additional
burden.
justice
stevens
whether
you
assume
that
or
not,
whether
you
assume
that
or
not.
justice
stevens
whatever
his
reason.
whether
he
wants
it
because
he
just
does...
he
wants
to
take
a
chance
on
seeing
how
he'll
feel
without
it,
he
wants
to
disagree
with
doctors,
he
wants
to
look
different
to
the
client,
is
it
his
burden
to
convince
the
judge
that
he
has
an
adequate
reason,
or
is
it
the
state's
burden
to
convince
the
judge
they
have
an
adequate
reason
to
continue.
which
is
your
view?
justice
stevens
and
just
simply
saying
i
don't
want
it
should
not
weigh
in
the
scale
at
all?
justice
stevens
and
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
want
to
take
the
medication
anymore
just
doesn't
carry
weight
in
the
argument?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
this
is
testimony
before
the
hearing
in
response
to
his
motion,
isn't
it?
there
was
a
hearing
in
response
to
his
motion,
wasn't
there?
justice
stevens
yeah.
and
what
was
the
testimony
at
that
hearing
on
the
issue
of
competence
to
stand
trial
if
the
medication
were
discontinued?
didn't
they
basically
say
we're
really
not
sure?
justice
stevens
what
did
they
say
on
the
question
of
whether
they
thought
he
would
be
competent
if
the
medication
were
discontinued?
justice
stevens
so...
then
you're
saying
that
we
have
to
assume
that
the
judge
accepted
their
testimony.
in
other
words,
the
judge's
finding
would
be
that
he
would
have
still
been
competent
without
the
medication.
because
he
didn't
say
it
in
so
many
words,
we
presume
he
believed
the
experts.
i
think
that's
what
you
said
is
the
way
to
interpret
his
ruling.
justice
stevens
so
you
assume
he
believed
or
disbelieved
the
experts?
justice
stevens
if
he
believed
them,
then
you
had
to
come
down
on
the
side
of
competence,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
well,
two
said
he
would...
they
thought
he'd
be
competent
and
one
said
he
wasn't
sure.
justice
stevens
which
is
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
then?
justice
stevens
well,
the
dissenting
judged
in
the
nevada
supreme
court
used...
was
the
one
that
first
used
the
term.
where
did
he
get
the
idea?
justice
stevens
the
jury
was
informed
that
he
was
on
medication.
justice
stevens
and
how
much.
justice
stevens
and
why
he
was.
that's
right.
there
was
a
lot
of
testimony
in
that
regard
and
the
effects
of
mellaril
and
the
side
effects.
and
they
explained
why
he
was
able
to
accommodate
such
a
large
dosage.
and
i
think
essentially
nothing
was
held
back
except
this
claimed
unmedicated
demeanor
evidence,
which
in
our
view,
as
we've
expressed
in
our
brief,
and
as
the
american
psychiatric
association
brief
agrees,
is
not
particularly
relevant
evidence.
of
course
there
are
state
courts
that
take
another
view
on
that
issue,
aren't
there?
