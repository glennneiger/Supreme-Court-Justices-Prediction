justice
o'connor
now,
do
we
assume
on
this
record
that
the
use
of
the
mellaril
was
medically
appropriate?
justice
o'connor
well,
did
riggins
ever
challenge
that
below
or
make
an
issue
of
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
the
petitioner
wanted
it
stopped
in
order
that
he
could
appear
before
the
jury
in
his
natural
state,
whatever
that
was.
justice
o'connor
not
on
the
basis
that
the
giving
of
the
medication
was
medically
inappropriate
for
his
symptoms.
justice
o'connor
well,
we
have
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
record
below
us...
below.
and
i
assumed
that
we
would
have
to
consider
that
whatever
was
given
was
at
least
medically
appropriate.
that
doesn't
answer
the
ultimate
legal
question
here
of
whether,
nevertheless,
the
petitioner
could
have
a
right
to
have
it
stopped.
justice
o'connor
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
it
were
medically
appropriate,
would
you
be
here
at
all?
it's
still
ordered,
the
motion
was
denied,
but
it's
medically
appropriate.
would
you
be
here
nevertheless
arguing
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
the
issue.
justice
o'connor
would
you
still
be
here
arguing
that
he
had
the
right
to
deny,
even
if
it
were
medically
appropriate
that
he
be
given
it?
justice
o'connor
do
you
say
that
the
right
not
to
be
tried
while
incompetent
is
a
waivable
right
under
the
constitution?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
you
what
your
position
is
as
to
the
law.
is
it
a
waivable
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
was
there
ever
a
motion
by
the
defendant
in
court
to
stop
the
medication
for
purposes
of
letting
him
go
to
trial
without
being
medicated?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
there
was
such
a
motion.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
and
at
that
point
he
was
still
being
medicated.
justice
o'connor
and
the
motion
made
clear
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
medicated
anymore.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
for
purposes
of
the
trial?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
we
had
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
had
been
a
motion
to
terminate
the
medication.
justice
o'connor
and
the
state's
position
is
that,
or
was
that
it
could
continue
to
medicate.
justice
o'connor
the
court
made
no
findings
on
that
question
of
whether
he
would
remain
competent.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
yeah,
but
there
was
no
finding,
i
take
it,
after
he
filed
his
motion
to
terminate
the
medication.
there
was
no
finding
as
to
what
that
would
do--
justice
o'connor
--to
his
competency.
do
you
think
that's
required?
justice
o'connor
well,
assuming
that
a
particular
drug
is
being
administered,
and
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
drug
would
create
a
zombie-like
appearance
in
the
person
taking
the
drug
so
that
the
person
would
appear
disinterested
in
the
proceedings
going
on
and
as
though
they
had
no
effect
on
him
one
way
or
another.
now
do
you
think
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
avoid
that
kind
of
appearance
if
he's
going
to
appear
before
the
jury
and
indeed
testify
in
the
trial?
justice
o'connor
but
there
was
no
finding
below
as
to
whether
he
would
maintain
his
competence,
was
there?
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
mr.
tufteland,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
suppose
we
had
a
defendant
who
had
been
determined
to
be
competent
at
the
time
because
of
the
medication.
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
refuse
further
medication,
even
though
he
would
become
incompetent
at
trial?
justice
o'connor
is
it
waivable?
justice
o'connor
aren't
most
constitutional
rights
waivable?
justice
o'connor
and
why
isn't
that
one?
justice
o'connor
i
don't
think
we've
ever
decided,
have
we,
whether
it's
waivable?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
your
case
rest
on
the
position
that
it's
not
waivable?
what
if
we
were
to
decide
or
assume
that
it
is
waivable?
then
what's
the
state's
interest
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
of
these
is
riggins
versus
nevada
no.
90-8466,
and
the
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
shortly
after
being
taken
into
custody
on
murder
and
robbery
charges
the
petitioner,
david
riggins,
complained
to
a
psychiatrist
about
hearing
voices
and
having
trouble
sleeping.
the
psychiatrist
prescribed
the
antipsychotic
drug
mellaril.
later,
the
defense
attorney
moved
to
suspend
the
administration
of
mellaril
during
riggins'
trial.
after
taking
testimony
from
doctors
who
had
examined
riggins,
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
without
explaining
its
reasons
for
doing
so.
riggins
was
convicted
of
murder
and
robbery,
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
nevada
supreme
court
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
forced
administration
of
antipsychotic
medication
during
trial
violated
riggins'
rights
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
federal
constitution.
we
hold
that
it
did.
the
forceable
administration
of
medication
represents
a
substantial
interference
on
a
person's
liberty.
in
the
case
of
antipsychotic
drugs
which
are
designed
to
alter
the
brain's
chemical
balance
and
which
may
have
serious
or
even
fatal
side
effects,
the
interference
is
particularly
severe.
thus,
once
riggins
moved
to
terminate
administration
of
antipsychotic
medication,
nevada
became
obligated
to
establish
the
need
for
mellaril
and
the
medical
appropriateness
of
the
drug.
the
trial
court,
however,
denied
riggins'
motion
to
stop
administration
of
mellaril
without
making
any
determination
of
the
need
for
the
medication
or
any
findings
about
alternatives
to
forcing
antipsychotic
medication
on
riggins.
this
error
may
well
have
impaired
riggins'
trial
rights.
the
testimony
of
doctors
who
examined
riggins
establishes
that
the
dosage
he
received
was
within
the
toxic
range
and
may
have
made
him
nervous,
drowsy,
or
confused
during
the
trial.
such
side
effects
may
have
impacted
riggins'
demeanor
but
for
jurors,
the
content
of
his
trial
testimony,
his
ability
to
follow
the
proceedings
or
his
communication
with
his
counsel.
because
the
record
offers
no
basis
for
saying
that
this
strong
possibility
of
trial
prejudice
was
justified,
we
reverse
the
judgment
bellow
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
of
the
court;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined
in
part.
