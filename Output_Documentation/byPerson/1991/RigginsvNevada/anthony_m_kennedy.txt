justice
kennedy
is
there
any
explanation
for
why
he
initiated
the
proceeding
for
an
order
to
terminate
the
medication?
there
had
never
been
an
order
to
begin
it,
to
give
the
medication
at
the
outset.
why
was
it
necessary
for
him
to
move
to
terminate
the
medication?
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
threatened
that
they
were
going
to
force
it
on
him?
justice
kennedy
well,
did
the
court
order
say
to
the
doctors
you
are
hereby
directed
and
instructed
to
forcibly
medicate
him?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
do
you
need
a
motion
to
terminate?
why
can't
you
just
tell
your
doctor,
i
don't
want
this
medicine?
justice
kennedy
does
every
prisoner
in
the
state
of
nevada
have
to
go
to
the
court
before
he
can
tell
his
doctor
not
to
give
him
medicine?
justice
kennedy
is
the
inference
here
that
he
was
not
competent
to
tell
the
doctor?
justice
kennedy
so
that's
an
irrelevant
consideration
of
the
court?
justice
kennedy
well,
he
didn't
vocalize
the
opinion?
he
made
no
findings
at
all
on
the
point,
did
he?
justice
kennedy
and
you've
admitted
that
they're
relevant
to
the
consideration?
justice
kennedy
are
they
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
the
trial
court?
justice
kennedy
why?
justice
kennedy
but
your
position
was
that
after
the
court's
ruling
you
could
forcibly
medicate
him
if
you
chose?
