justice
scalia
did
he
increase
it
or
did
riggins
himself
increase
it?
i
thought
that
there
was
something
in
the
statement
here
that
suggested
that
riggins
himself
decided
he
wanted
to
take
more.
justice
scalia
at
riggins'
request
or
not
at
riggins'
request?
justice
scalia
he
had.
justice
scalia
you
can't
really
say
that
it
was...
that
the
increased
was
forced
upon
riggins
by
the
physicians
here?
justice
scalia
mr.
yampolsky,
as
i
understand
it,
just
as
you
did
not
argue
below,
and
certainly
did
not
argue
in
your
petition,
that
the
administration
was
medically
inappropriate,
so
also
nevada
did
not
argue
below
that...
or
in
its
response
to
the
petition
that
he
could
have
simply
declined
to
take
it
on
his
own.
they
never
made
that
argument,
did
they?
justice
scalia
i
certainly
don't
recall.
i
assume
that
the
case
is
here
on
the
assumption
that
the
drugs
were
medically...
appropriately
medically
prescribed...
on
the
assumption,
whether
it's
true
or
not,
that
they
were
medically
prescribed
and
that
the
prescription
was
appropriate,
and
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
take
them.
i
assumed
that
that
was
what
we
were
going
to
talk
about
this
morning.
justice
scalia
but
you
never
made
that
argument
before.
i
mean,
the
question
presented
says
whether
the
forcible...
forcible,
and
they
never
denied
forcible...
whether
the
forcible
administration
of
anti-psychotic
drugs
to
an
insanity
defendant
during
trial
violates
the
defendant's
rights
under
the
due
process
clause.
you
never
say
anything
about
the
forcible
administration
of
unnecessary
or
inappropriate
anti-psychotic
drugs.
you
just...
that's
not
the
point
you
made
in
your
petition.
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you
want
to
introduce
it
now
for?
justice
scalia
it's
not
a
very
interesting
question.
of
course
you
can't
force
somebody
to
take
inappropriate
drugs,
whether
he's
a
prisoner
or
not.
i
mean,
that's
not
a
hard
legal
question
at
all.
justice
scalia
i
read
your
question
presented
again.
was
the
forcible
administration
of
antipsychotic
drugs
to
an
insanity
defendant
during...
whether
the
forcible
administration
violates
the
defendant's
rights.
there's
not
a
suggestion
in
the
question
presented
that
this
was
inappropriate
medication.
i
thought
your
whole
point
was
it
was
appropriate
to
calm
him
down,
but
he
didn't
want
to
be
calmed
down.
he
wanted
to
appear
insane.
i
thought
that
was
the
question
we
were
going
to
talk
about.
justice
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
it.
justice
scalia
where
is
this
in
your
question
presented,
again?
i
don't
see
it.
i
thought
we
were
going
to
talk
about
not
whether
they
gave
him
too
much
or
too
little,
but
whether,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
take
any,
he
can
simply...
even
if
he
needs
it,
even
if
it's
medically
appropriate,
he
can
simply
say
i
don't
want
to
accept
any
forcible
administration.
that's
the
only
thing
that's
in
your
question
presented.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
finding
was,
i'm
talking
about
what
you
came
to
this
court
presenting
us
to
decide,
and
on
the
basis
of
which
we
accepted
this
case.
now
the
case
gets
here,
and
you
want
to
talk
about
something
different.
are
the
questions
presented
in
your
brief
the
same
questions
you
presented
in
your
petition
for
cert?
justice
scalia
there
was
no
finding
below.
did
you
ask
for
a
finding?
i
mean,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
don't
know
whether
these
drugs
did
anything
except
make
a
defendant
who
would
otherwise
appear
insane
appear
sane,
which
is
perhaps
bad
enough.
i
thought
that
was
the
point
you
wanted
to
argue.
if
you
give
somebody
medication
so
that
whereas
he
would
appear
insane
to
the
jury,
he
appears
sane.
he
doesn't
appear
zombie-like,
necessarily,
or
indifferent,
necessarily...
or
remorseless,
necessarily...
but
he
just
appears
sane.
i
thought
that
that
was
your
objection.
he
should
be
able
to
appear
insane
if
indeed
he
is.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
scalia
mr.
tufteland,
there
was
no
finding,
but
perhaps
there
was
no
finding
because
his
motion
wasn't
based
on
that.
he
didn't
say,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
medication
because
i
don't
need
it
to
remain
competent.
he
didn't
say
i
could
take
much
less
or
i
could
take
none
at
all
and
still
remain
competent.
as
i
understood
his
motion,
it
was
whether
or
not
i
will
be
incompetent,
i
want
you
to
order
the
medication
stopped.
justice
scalia
had
he
come
in
and
said,
i
will...
i
can
be
perfectly
competent
even
without
it,
then
the
judge
might
have
felt
the
need
to
make
such
a
finding,
but
that
wasn't
his
argument,
was
it?
justice
scalia
it
was
competence
or
noncompetence
doesn't
matter,
i
have
an
absolute
right--
justice
scalia
--not
to
take
the
medication.
justice
scalia
i
understood
what
went
on.
i
understood
mr.
yampolsky
to
say
in
answer
to
my
question
that
in
the
court,
in
the
state
court,
at
least
in
arguing
to
the
state
court,
he
never
went
so
far
as
to
adopt
the
position
that
even
if
it
did
render
him
incompetent,
he
would
have
a
right
to
refuse
the
medication
in
order
to,
in
effect,
project
his
genuine
demeanor.
i
take
you're
simply
contradicting
him
on
that
point.
justice
scalia
he
at
least...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
tufteland,
given
the
existing
state
of
the
record
at
the
time
this
motion
was
filed,
supposing
that
mr.
riggins
had
simply
stopped
taking
the
drug
on
his
own
and
walked
into
trial
on
the
trial
date
without
having
taken
it.
would
he
have
been
in
violation
of
any
court
order?
justice
scalia
they
were
asking
the
judge
to
take
a
chance
and
the
judge
said--
justice
scalia
--it's,
you
know,
this
thing
has
come
along
too
far
at
this
stage,
we're
close
to
trial,
i'm
not
going
to
take
this...
the
chance
at
this
point.
justice
scalia
mr.
tufteland,
did
the
defendant
appear
in
the
trial
at
any
stage
of
the
trial?
justice
scalia
what
did
he
say
at
the
guilt
phase?
justice
scalia
insane
testimony?
such
as
what?
justice
scalia
and
he
said
that
during
the
trial?
justice
scalia
he
didn't
say
anything
about
the
abused
childhood
story
about
marilyn
monroe
and--
justice
scalia
--but
he
didn't
repeat
that
at
trial?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
think
the
record
shows
about
his
zombie-like
state
or
anything
of
that
sort?
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
how
that...
i
mean
as
far
as
the
demeanor
goes,
i
don't
see
how
that
gets
you
anywhere
unless
his
demeanor
would
show
that
he's
incompetent.
i
mean,
isn't
your
demeanor
argument
tied
to
the
fact
that
you
wanted
this
man
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
himself
to
the
jury
as
a
madman?
that
was
your
whole
point
in
your
brief,
i
thought.
but
now
you're
saying,
well,
no,
of
course
we
didn't
want
him
to
be
incompetent.
but
if
he
didn't
appear
incompetent,
it
wouldn't
have
had
any
effect
on
the
jury.
justice
scalia
would
he
have
a
right
if
his
insanity
pushes
him
in
that
direction,
to
come
in
with
a
clown
hat
on
and
his
face
painted
yellow
in
order
to
demonstrate
by
his
demeanor
that
he
is
indeed
insane?
does
the
court
have
to
permit
that?
justice
scalia
there's
nothing
disorderly
about
his
coming
in
dressed
as
a
clown.
it's
just
his
natural
demeanor.
he
wants
to
demonstrate
it
to
the
jury.
he
wants
to
show
the
jury
he's
crazy.
does
the
court
have
to
permit
that?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
that
and
what
you're
arguing.
