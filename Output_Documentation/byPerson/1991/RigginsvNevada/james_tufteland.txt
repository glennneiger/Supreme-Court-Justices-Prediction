mr.
james
tufteland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
way
this
issue
was
initially
presented
to
the
trial
court
was
really
a
question
of
trial
strategy.
there
was
never
an
indication
in
this
case
that
mr.
riggins
was
a
harper-type
defendant
who
did
not
want
to
be
medicated.
the
testimony
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
reveals
that
mr.
riggins
was
admitted
into
the
county
jail
right
after
his
arrest.
shortly
after
being
incarcerated,
he
complained
of
hearing
voices
and
having
trouble
sleeping.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
interview
with
the
jail
psychiatrist
and...
at
which
time
he
took
a
short
medical
history
from
the
defendant...
at
which
time
he
learned
that
mr.
riggins
had
previously
been
medicated
with
mellaril
some
6
years
earlier
by
dr.
o'gorman
and
that
the
drug
had
worked
effectively
for
him.
the
psychiatrist
then
prescribed
a
moderate
dose
of
mellaril,
which
was
primarily
designed
to
control
anxiety.
over
the
course
of
the
next
several
months,
the
dosage
was
increased
four
or
five
times.
dr.
quass
saw
him
two
or
three
times
after
that.
riggins
himself
did
request
an
increase
in
the
dose
because
he
continued
to
hear
these
voices.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
medication
was
medical
treatment.
at
no
time
did
the
trial
court--
mr.
james
tufteland
--that
was--
mr.
james
tufteland
--mr.
yampolsky
filed
that
motion
in
july
or
june
of
'88.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
true.
mr.
james
tufteland
the...
well,
the--
mr.
james
tufteland
--the
motion
itself
did
not,
for
instance,
have
an
affidavit
from
the
defendant
indicating
he
had
some
sort
of
a
liberty
interest
in
not
being
medicated.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
correct.
a
motion
like
that
was
filed.
mr.
james
tufteland
the
state's
position...
the
state's
concern
at
that
point
was
maintaining
defendant's
competency
to
stand
trial.
i
don't
believe
the
trial
attorney
at
the
time
cared
one
way
or
the
other
whether
the
defendant's
unmedicated
demeanor
came
before
the
jury.
our
concern
was
will
we
have
a
competent
defendant
to
take
to
trial,
because
in
nevada
that's
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
mr.
james
tufteland
the
court
had
entered
a...
order
of
competency
some
months
earlier.
prior
to
the
preliminary
hearing
in
this
case,
mr.
yampolsky
filed
a
motion
to
have
a
competency
determination
made
by
the
district
courts.
in
nevada,
then
the
case
is
transferred
up
to
the
district
court
for
the
appointment
of
psychiatrists.
and
that's
the
time
when
the
additional
psychiatrists
came
in
to
interview
the
defendant.
based
on
the
reports,
and
there
were
two
reports...
actually
three
reports
that
went
to
the
court.
two
of
them
said
he
was
competent
to
assist
counsel
at
trial,
and
dr.
jurasky's
report
indicated
that
he
was
a
paranoid
schizophrenic,
that
he
was
incompetent,
and
that
he
was...
well,
he
was
incompetent
for
that
purpose.
based
on
the
reports,
the
court
issued
an
order
declaring
him
to
be
competent
and
then
remanded
for
preliminary
hearing.
so
there
had
been
a
judicial
finding
of
competency
about
4
months
before
the
motion
to
terminate.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
correct.
mr.
james
tufteland
i
don't
believe
so.
the
court
had
already
determined
that
he
would
be
competent,
and
it
was
just
a
matter
of
eventually
going
to
trial.
all
that
was
before
the
court
was
the
defense
motion
to
terminate
the
medication,
not
because
of
liberty
interests
like
in
harper,
but
simply
to
present
this
trial
defense
of
an
unmedicated
demeanor
evidence.
mr.
james
tufteland
no.
no,
i
don't.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
i
think
you've
got
a
more
detailed
statement
than
that,
though.
it's
not...
he's
not
making
a
statement
like
harper
did.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
true.
mr.
james
tufteland
if
we
assume
that
the
washington
v.
harper
liberty
interest
applies
to
this
defendant
in
this
circumstance--
mr.
james
tufteland
--yeah--
mr.
james
tufteland
--i
frankly
think
it
would
be
his
burden
to
show
that
it
shouldn't
be
continued.
mr.
james
tufteland
yeah,
based
on
the
motion,
then...
based
on
the
motion,
the
court
conducted
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
primarily
the
decision...
the
concern
of
the
court
was
what
should
my
decision
be.
do
we
continue
to
medicate
this
person?
he
wanted
to
find
out
if
we
terminate
the
medication,
what's
the
possibility
of
the
defendant
becoming
incompetent,
because
if
that
happens,
the
trial
goes
off
calendar
and
we
don't
know
when
it
would
ever
be
re-calendared.
they
had
the
hearing
and
based
on
the
evidence
adduced,
the
court
concluded
that
the
safest
course,
and
the
most
prudent
course,
was
to
continue
the
medication
because
the
evidence
presented
by
the
psychiatrists
indicated
that
he
actually
handled
that
dose
quite
well,
even
though
it
was
a
large
dose.
and
he
did
that
because
he
had
used
mellaril--
mr.
james
tufteland
--well,
he's
the
moving
party.
mr.
james
tufteland
i
think
he's
got
the
burden
to
convince
the
court
to
grant
what
he's
requesting.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
that
sounds
like
a
good
reason
to
me.
mr.
james
tufteland
no
such
theory
was
advanced
at
the
time
because
it
wasn't
really
raised.
obviously,
i
think
the
state
does
have
that
kind
of
an
interest.
the
man
is--
mr.
james
tufteland
--the
court...
the
court's
concern,
i
think
was
that
if
the
medication
was
terminated,
there
was
at
least
a--
mr.
james
tufteland
--yes.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
it
was
a
rather
short
form
of
the
order.
mr.
james
tufteland
that
was
about
the
nature
of
his
rationale.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
the
question
of
the
demeanor
evidence,
i
don't
think
was
ever
really
addressed
by
the
courts.
mr.
james
tufteland
it
was
raised.
that
was
the
thrust
of
his--
mr.
james
tufteland
--no,
it's
a
constitutional
claim.
the
court...
what
i'm
saying
is
the
court
never
vocalized
an
opinion
as
to
whether
demeanor
evidence
was
relevant
evidence.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
no,
he
didn't.
it
was
just
a--
mr.
james
tufteland
--am
i
admitting
that?
mr.
james
tufteland
no.
mr.
james
tufteland
the
trial
court's
decision
was
simply
whether
or
not
termination
of
medication
would
render
the
defendant
incompetent.
the
question
of
whether
the
demeanor
evidence
is
relevant
or
not,
i
think,
goes
to
the
weight
it
would
have
on
the
jury,
not
so
much
to
its
admissibility.
mr.
james
tufteland
not
if
terminating
the
medication
is
going
to
make
him
incompetent
to
go
to
trial.
i
think
that
the
medication
can
be
terminated,
but
he
can
maintain
competency,
i
see
no
problem
with
that
kind
of
evidence
coming
before
the
jury.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
there
was
no
explicit
finding
by
the
court.
mr.
james
tufteland
the
court
merely
entered
an
order
saying
the
motion
to
terminate
is
denied.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
correct.
mr.
james
tufteland
no.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
right.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
correct.
mr.
james
tufteland
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
he
stipulated
that
competency
was
a
jurisdictional
requirement
and
it
could
not
be
waived.
mr.
james
tufteland
i'm
not
sure
what
he
intended
by
that
statement.
i
just
noted
that
it
was
in
the
record.
the
thrust
of
his
motion
was
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
under
the
due
process
clause
to
appear
before
the
jury
in
an
unmedicated
condition.
mr.
james
tufteland
no.
there
was
no
court
order
ever
requiring
him
to
be
medicated.
and
the
only
court
order
entered
in
this
regard
was
the
motion
to
terminate
medication,
which
was
simply
denying
a
defense
counsel's
motion.
had
he
done
that,
presumably,
unless
the
jail
authorities
brought
it
to
the
court's
attention
or
somebody's
attention
that
he
was
refusing
medication,
then
something
might
have
occurred.
but
had
he
been
able--
mr.
james
tufteland
--well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
actually
supports
the
idea
that
he
didn't
continue
to
voluntarily
consume
the
medication.
mr.
james
tufteland
i
think
they
addressed
the
question
pretty
much
as
it
was
presented
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
this
constitutional
right
to
appear
unmedicated.
i'm
assuming
that
they
just
assumed
for
the
sake
of
their
decision
that
the
medication
was
forcibly
administered.
mr.
james
tufteland
he
was...
as
far
as
i
know,
he
was
in
the
clark
county
jail.
they
do
have
a
medical
section
within
the
jail.
mr.
james
tufteland
and
he
may
have
been
there.
i'm
not
real
sure.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
mr.
yampolsky
raised
that
issue
within
a
couple
of
weeks
of
the
arrest.
mr.
james
tufteland
he
filed
the
motion
to
have
psychiatrists
appointed
for
interviews,
and
the
lower
court--
mr.
james
tufteland
--well,
they
transferred
the
case
up
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
appointed
the
psychiatrists
who
interviewed
him.
they
submitted
their
reports,
and
then
based
on
those
reports,
the
court
entered
an
order
declaring
him
to
be
competent
to
stand
trial.
mr.
james
tufteland
the
psychiatric
interviews
occurred...
two
of
them
are
in
february
of
'88,
and
the
other,
i
believe,
was
in
early
march
of
'88.
mr.
james
tufteland
well--
mr.
james
tufteland
--the
motion
of
mr.
yampolsky
simply
asserted
that
in
dealing
with
his
client
he
felt
that
he...
there
were
concerns
about
his
competency
based
on
conferring
with
him.
and
he
wanted
the
question
resolved.
so
obviously
there
were
some
behavioral
signs
to
defense
counsel
that
spurred
him
to
file
the
motion.
mr.
james
tufteland
our
position
would
have
been
if
the...
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
competency
for
trial,
we
could
have
forcibly
medicated
him.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
that's
why
they
had
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
i
think
that
the
court
entertained
the
opinions
of
the
three
psychiatrists
who
testified
plus
the
reports
of
the
other
two
psychiatrists
whose
reports
were
before
the
court.
dr.
patel,
who
had
examined
the
defendant
in
january
of
'87,
had
diagnosed
him
as
being
paranoid
schizophrenic.
and
based
on
the
testimony
that
came
before
the
court,
that
type
of
diagnosis
indicated
that
if
the
medicated
was
terminated,
he'd
become
incompetent.
dr.
jurasky
also
found
him
to
be
paranoid
schizophrenic--
mr.
james
tufteland
--to
terminate?
yes.
mr.
james
tufteland
dr.
o'gorman
was
not
sure.
he
basically
would
not
volunteer
an
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
because
he
had
never
interviewed
the
person
when
not
medicated.
drs.
quass
and
master
felt...
their
diagnosis
was
that
he
was
a
paranoid
personality,
but
they
didn't
believe
he
suffered
from
schizophrenia.
they
felt
that...
based
on--
mr.
james
tufteland
--most
likely
they
thought
he
would
remain
competent.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
i
think
the
way
to
interpret
it
is
that
if
you
look
at
defense
counsel's
statement
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
he
said
the
evidence
before
the
court
is
conflicting
and
basically
no
one
knows
what
will
happen
if
the
medication
is
terminated.
the
nature
of
the--
mr.
james
tufteland
--well,
i
think
he
pretty
much
believed
them,
but
there
were
conflicting
opinions.
mr.
james
tufteland
there
were
conflicting
opinions.
mr.
james
tufteland
and
then
there--
mr.
james
tufteland
--well,
there
were
two
reports
submitted
in
addition
to
those,
jurasky
and
patel.
there
were
five
psychiatrists
who
had
input
with
the
court
on
this
motion.
mr.
james
tufteland
right.
mr.
james
tufteland
right.
mr.
james
tufteland
i
think
that
was
the
rationale
basically.
the
test...
even
though
they
said
they
thought
in
their
medical
judgment
he
would
remain
competent,
they
said
there
was...
existed
the
possibility
that
he
wouldn't.
mr.
james
tufteland
our
position
would
be--
mr.
james
tufteland
--we
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
james
tufteland
yes.
mr.
james
tufteland
i
think
because
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
this
situation
where
in
nevada
where
competency
is
jurisdictional
and
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
indicated
that
due
process
requires
a
person
to
be
competent
when
they
go
to
trial.
mr.
james
tufteland
no,
you
have
not.
but
i
think
that
the
state's
interest
in
trying
people
who
are
competent
is
so
compelling
that
it
should
be
deemed
a
right
that
is
not
waivable.
basically,
when
a
person
goes
to
trial,
we
are
trying
to
adjudicate
people
in
a
fair
proceeding
so
that
we
get
verdicts
that
are
reliable
and
verdicts
in
which
the
public
has
confidence.
and
we
want
verdicts
in
which
the
guilty
are
found
guilty,
and
innocent
people
are
acquitted.
and
if
you're
trying
people
who--
mr.
james
tufteland
--well,
i
mean
our
interest
is
the
same
regardless,
and
if
you
hold
that
it's
waivable,
then
that's
your
opinion.
the
issue
itself
never
came
before
any
court
in
this
case.
so
in
a
sense
it's
an
academic
inquiry.
mr.
yampolsky
had
stipulated
that
it
was
not
waivable,
and
so
it
never
became
a
decision
for
the
nevada
judge
to
make.
mr.
james
tufteland
he
testified
at
the
guilt
phase.
mr.
james
tufteland
he
testified
about
his
background,
explaining
when
he
began
hearing
voices
at
the
age
of
4,
and
about
an
abused
childhood,
about
his
delusional
episodes
over
the
course
of
his
life.
he
testified
as
to
his
account
of
the
crime,
which
contained
elements
of
self-defense
and
elements
of
basically
insane
testimony,
if
you
will.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
he...
claiming
that
the
victim
was
trying
to
put
aids-infected
blood
on
his
cocaine
to
kill
him,
and
that
he
tried
to
put
fiberglass
in
his
water
to
kill
him.
very
delusional
thinking
indicated
at
the
time
of
trial
in
his
testimony.
mr.
james
tufteland
he
testified
to
the
jury
in
that
fashion.
he
did
not
testify
at
the
penalty
phase.
mr.
james
tufteland
that
was
brought
out
by
defense
counsel,
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
told
a
prior
therapist
about
that.
mr.
james
tufteland
he
did
in
a
sense.
i
mean,
it
was
brought...
he
was
asked
that
question
by
defense
counsel
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
indeed
told
a
prior
therapist
about
that
incident.
so
the
jury
was
actually
well
informed,
i
think,
regarding
his
mental
state,
through
his
own
testimony
and
through
the
testimony
of
dr.
jurasky.
and
in
the
state's
case
in
chief,
there
were
about
four
witnesses
who
provided
testimony
relative
to
mr.
riggins'
demeanor
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
crime.
in
fact,
there
was
an
individual
that
actually
drove
him
to
the
crime
scene
and
back.
i
mean,
that's
about
as
close
to
having
an
independent
witness
of
demeanor
as
you
can
get.
mr.
james
tufteland
well,
there's
nothing
that
i
can
find
in
the
record
that
supports
that
kind
of
a
characterization.
it
would
seem
to
me
that--
mr.
james
tufteland
--i
don't
know.
there
was
nothing
that
i've
seen
in
that
record
that
comes
close
to
supporting
a
characterization--
mr.
james
tufteland
--yes,
they
were.
mr.
james
tufteland
oh,
yes.
mr.
james
tufteland
that's
correct.
i
mean,
the
case
law
comes
down
both
ways.
i
think
the
apa
brief
does
an
excellent
job,
though,
of
debunking
that
kind
of
evidence
as
being
reliable.
and
i
had
planned
even
to
discuss
that,
but
i
don't
think
i
really
need
to.
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
i
will
submit
it.
