chief
justice

mr.
yampolsky,
i
don't
thing
you've
answered
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
is
did
the
petitioner
in
the
nevada
district
court
challenge
the
giving
of
this
dosage
as
being
medically
inappropriate?
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
mr.
yampolsky,
the
forcible
issue
is
raised
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
the
medically
appropriate
issue
isn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
half
an
hour
to
argue
your
case,
and
surely
the
main
thrust
of
it
is
the
point
that
the
medication
was
forcibly
administered
against
his
wishes,
so
why
don't
you
get
on
with
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
yampolsky.
mr.
tufteland,
we'll
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tufteland.
mr.
yampolsky,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
resulted
in
a
continuance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yampolsky.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
