mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court:
to
the
defendant
on
trial
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
of
this
country,
the
only
things
that
stand
between
that
defendant
and
the
power
of
the
state
to
imprison
him
are
his
attorney
and
the
jury,
and
we
would
submit
to
this
court
that
it
is
the
ultimate
private
choice
of
that
defense
attorney
and
his
client
to
exercise
the
peremptory
challenge
as
the
attorney
and
the
defendant
see
fit
based
on
the
facts
of
each
case.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
agree
with
that.
to
that
defendant,
the
ability
to
choose
certain
jurors
over
other
jurors
through
peremptory
challenges
is
in
many
cases
one
of
the
most
significant
and
most
meaningful
tools
that
that
defendant
has
in
exercising
his
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
trial
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
criminal
defendant
and
the
civil
litigants
as
in
edmondson.
as
this
court
stated,
edmondson
held
in
the
ordinary
context
of
a
civil
litigation
in
which
the
government
is
not
a
party,
the
adversarial
relationship
which
this
court
defined
in
polk
county
v.
dodson
is
paramount
in
this
issue.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
court
held
that
a
federal
public
defender
is
not
a
state
actor
in
performing
the
traditional
defense
functions.
in
that
case,
the
traditional
defense
function
was
a
motion
to
withdraw
from
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
appeal
was
frivolous.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
more
traditional
in
the
trial
of
a
case
and
the
defense
of
a
client
than
helping
that
client
select
an
impartial
jury.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
civil
context...
the
court
in
edmondson,
as
i
read
it,
distinguished
the
situation
in
which
the
government
would
be
a
party
to
an
action.
i
think
in
the
civil
context
between
civil
parties
i
am
clearly
bound
by
edmondson.
i
don't
think
the
question
has
been
answered
yet
if
the
government
is
one
of
those
parties
in
the
civil
action.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
my
case
is
different
than
that
because
the
government
is
the
very
party
that
i
am
in
opposition
to
in
a
case.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
but
the
posture
of
the
parties
is
slightly
different.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
in
the
civil--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
a
civil
action
the
parties
are
acting
under
the
same
rules
and
guidelines
to
achieve
the
end
of
a
jury
verdict
or
a
judgment
for
money
damages
or
property.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
your
honor,
the
distinction
is
the
difference
in
which
the
posture
of
the
criminal
defendant
is
placed
to
that
party.
our
legislature
and
our
constitution
recognized
from
the
very
beginning
that
that
criminal
defendant
comes
into
that
criminal
trial
as
a
distinct
underdog
against
the
awesome
power
of
the
state,
and
for
that
reason
at
least
five
constitutional
amendments
deal
solely
with
the
powers
that
the
defendant
has,
the
constitutional
rights
he
has
to
defend
himself,
and
the
purpose
for
that,
as
i
see
it--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--i'm
speaking
primarily
of
the
federal
constitution
in
this
instance,
and
the
purpose--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
this
court
has
held
in
ross
v.
oklahoma,
of
course,
that
the
peremptory
challenge
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension,
but
in
the
same
paragraph
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
peremptory
challenge
is
a
means
to
that
constitutional
end,
and
how
far
a
means
has
to
go
to
become
implied
in
that
constitutional
provision
is
yet
to
be
decided.
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
as
this
court
decided
in
west
v.
adkins,
the
court
in
west
v.
adkins
reviewed
carefully
the
decision
in
polk
county.
the
decisions
were
different.
the
physician
in
west
was
held
not
to
be
a
state
actor,
the
public
defender
in
polk
county
was
held
to
be
a
state
actor,
but
the
significant
language
to
me
was
that
the
west
case
held
that
the
decisive
factor
in
polk
county
is
the
adversarial
relationship,
recognizing
that
the
criminal
defendant
is
pitted
totally
against
the
state
in
that
situation.
we
would
submit
that
you
cannot
separate
the
function
of
counsel
in
the
sense
to
say
that
at
one
stage
of
the
proceeding
defending
a
client
you're
a
state
actor
and
at
one
stage
you're
not.
the
motion
to
withdraw,
that's
a
result
of
either
statutory
or
decisional
law
that's
conferred
upon
the
defendant.
every
single
function
that
the
defendant
would
undertake
in
his
defense
has
some
source
in
state
law,
and
so
we
are
troubled
with
the
proposition
that
we
can
have
one
hat
on
while
exercising
a
peremptory
challenge
and
be
called
a
state
actor
and
take
that
hat
off
and
in
the
very
next
function
of
the
trial,
whether
it
be
subpoenaing
the
witness,
whether
it
be
motion
in
limine,
whether
it
be
cross-examination,
that
we
could
not
be
a
state
actor
in
one
sense.
we
feel
like--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
judge
in
the
specific
context
of
the
peremptory
challenge
does
nothing
more
than
administratively
acquiesce
to
the
private
decision
the
attorney
has
made
under
the
law
to
exercise
a
choice,
that
the
function
of
the
judge
is
merely
an
acquiescence,
that
he
takes
no
official
action
in
regard
to
that
juror,
and
in
fact
in
many
cases
in
georgia
the
judge
makes
no
comment
whatsoever.
the
juror
stands,
both
parties
are
present
when
the
peremptory
challenge
is
exercised,
and
either
side
chooses
to,
when
their
turn
comes,
excuse
the
juror,
and
the
juror
is
excused
and
walks
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
juror
knows
clearly
which
party
chose
to
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge
and
exclude
that
juror,
and
the
function
of
the
judge
in
that
case
is
not
tantamount
to
an
official
proceeding
or
an
official
sanction
of
what
happened.
we
would
submit
that
the
action
of
the
judge
in
ruling
on
objections
is
more
participatory
or
more
of
a
function
of
injecting
himself
into
the
trial
than
anything--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
in
that
case
it
would
seem
that
the
court,
as
in
batson,
has
already
determined
and
held
that
that
right
to
object
exists.
we're
here
arguing
as
strongly
as
we
can
against
imposing
that
very
state
action
upon
the
defendant,
that
very
interference
of
the
court
on
the
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
in
somewhat
of
a
predicament
because
i
have
not
seen
a
jury,
but
yet
i
have
been
stereotyped
and
my
clients
have
been
stereotyped
as
the
type
of
people
who
will
excuse
jurors
based
on
racial
animus.
we
don't
intend--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--i
am
arguing
for
a
right
to
choose,
a
right--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--or
no
reason,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
we
don't
intend
to
discriminate
intentionally
on
anyone.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
has
implied
that
in
its
holding
in
powers
and
also
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
hernandez
v.
new
york,
in
which
the
court
seems
to
indicate
that
there
are...
there's
a
continuum
where
on
one
end
the
peremptory
challenge
is
solely
out
of
racial
animus
and
on
the...
somewhere
moving
down
the
continuum
there
are
racial
factors
which
influence
the
decision
which
are
going
to
make
it
more
and
more
acceptable
to
the
trial
judge
when
offered.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
it
may
very
well
be,
your
honor.
it
seemed
clear
to
me
in
batson
that
the
evil
that
was
sought
to
be
prevented
was
the
assumption
that
had
been
carried
forward
from
strauda
v.
west
virginia
to
date
that
black
people
as
a
race
for
various
stereotypical
reasons
could
not
decide
a
case
properly,
not
that
there
were
factors
involved
in
the
case
that
would
influence
their
decision
or
cause
empathy
or
sympathy
toward
the
defendant
and
concern
him
about
whether
he
would
be
fairly
tried,
but
that
the
decision
was
that
they
could
not
decide
a
case.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
that
case
the
candor
of
the
juror
in
responding
to
a
voir
dire
question
that
way
would
be
applauded,
and
the
judge
may
very
well
excuse
the
juror
because
of
that
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
about
to
embark...
i
read
that
there's
a...
cert
was
granted
in
a
court
of
appeals
case
in
texas
in
which
two
black
jurors
were
excused
in
a
civil
case
and
the
issue
on
appeal
is
whether
the
explanation
which
the
trial
judge
approved
was
satisfactory,
and
we
as
a
result
of
edmondson,
and
if
the
court
rules
for
the
state
of
georgia
in
this
case,
we
will
see
a
new
body
of
law
on
whether
the
explanation
is
satisfactory
or
not.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
state
is
going
to
have
very
little
incentive
in
that
situation
to
carry
the
case
on,
and
the
juror
is
likely
going
to
have
very
little
incentive
in
seeing
a
trial...
a
case
retried
or
reversed.
yes,
sir,
i
would
agree
with
that.
in
regard
to
the
state
action
argument,
it
seems
critical
that
throughout
all
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
examined
private
actors
to
determine
whether
state
action
exists,
while
the
cases
vary
widely
in
their
facts
and
circumstances,
the
common
thread
is
that
there
is
always
found
a
cooperation
between
the
private
actor
and
the
state
in
which
the
state...
in
which
they're
acting
together
in
concert,
not
in
conflict
with
one
another.
one
thing
that
is
troubling
to
the
defense
and
is
troubling
because
it
seems
to
be
a
central
focus
of
edmondson
is
the
proposition...
the
holding...
that
the
private
litigants
have
been
delegated
the
responsibility
of
selecting
a
jury,
and
that
that
jury
constitutes
officials
or
employees
of
the
government,
and
therefore
in
selecting
that
jury
it's
tantamount
to
state
action.
when
we
view
the
state
as
our
bitter
and
staunch
adversary
and,
under
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
trial,
impartial
jury,
we
view
those
very
jurors
as
being
employees
or
officials
of
the
state,
that's
a
proposition
that
is
inconsistent
and
very
troubling.
we
would
submit
that
while
that
may
very
well
be
the
case
in
the
civil
situation,
in
which
the
jury
has
arguably
been
delegated
the
responsibility
to
arbitrate
or
decide
the
civil
actions,
the
jury
in
the
criminal
case
cannot
be
considered
an
employee
or
official
of
the
government.
the
jury
is...
and
the
law
and
the
defense
attorney
is
what
stands
between
that
defendant
and
oppression,
and
the
idea
that
the
jury--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
would
liken
the
jury
more
to
a
trustee
of
the
people.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
but
the
jury
have
the
bond
of
trust
to
their
peers,
in
which
they
have
the
ultimate
fact-finding
say-so
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence,
and
for
that
reason--
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
they're
an
independent
body,
standing
between
the
state
on
one
hand
and
the
defendant
on
the
other.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
absolutely.
although
this
court
has
clearly
held
over
and
over
again
that
the
peremptory
challenge
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension,
we
would
submit
that
between
voir
dire
and
the
selection
of
the
jury
there
has
got
to
be
some
means
implemented
to
secure
the
defendant's
right
to
select
an
impartial
jury.
voir
dire
is
very
limited
in
federal
cases.
the
peremptory
challenge
was
designed
to
operate
in
conjunction
with
the
voir
dire.
we
don't
think
in
practice
the
voir
dire
effectively
determines
who
may
be
biased,
who
may
be
prejudiced,
who
may
have
empathy,
who
may
have
sympathy.
all
of
the
briefs
make
reference
to
various
studies,
and
one
of
the
studies
is
that
it
is
a
human
tendency
not
to
respond
intentionally
or
subconsciously
that
one
is
biased
in
answering
voir
dire
questions.
on
the
one
hand
we've
got
a
juror,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
who
candidly
admits
his
bias.
on
the
other
hand,
we've
got
a
juror
who
is
totally
impartial.
most
jurors
fall
somewhere
in
between,
and
because
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
they
have
empathies,
sympathies,
human
experiences
which
affect
their
ability
to
decide
the
case.
we
have
got
to
have
some
way
to
ferret
out
as
best
we
can
those
human
tendencies
in
order
to
secure
the
right
to
an
impartial
trial.
what
we're
really
concerned
about
is
that
ultimately
if
this
court
were
to
extend
state
action
to
private
attorneys
in
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges,
would
be
the
natural
consequence
that
it
would
have
to
decide
peremptory
challenges
based
on
gender,
peremptory
challenges
based
on
ethnic
issues,
peremptory
challenges
based
on
all
of
the
other
stereotypes.
mr.
robert
h.
revell,
jr.
very
probably
so,
your
honor,
but
hopefully
we
won't
have
to
do
it
for
the
defendant.
one
of
the
ironies,
and
this
is
brought
out
by
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund
in
their
brief
in
support
of
petitioner,
is
that
the
evil
which
was
sought
to
be
prevented
in
batson,
the
exclusion
from
the
jury
of
the
members
of
the
defendant's
race,
may
have
come
full
circle
so
that
a
ruling
prohibiting
parties
from
any
peremptory
challenge
based
on
whatever
reason,
including
race,
would
have
the
effect
of
prohibiting
the
minority
defendant,
the
underrepresented
defendant,
from
being
able
to
use
the
peremptory
challenge
to
have
members
of
his
or
her
own
group
on
the
jury.
the
underrepresented
minority
defendant
would
not
be
able
to
use
his
peremptory
challenge
to
exclude
majority
members
to
enhance
the
opportunity
for
members
of
his
own
group
to
be
on
the
jury,
and
they
recognize
this
as
a
problem,
and
that's
why
in
their
brief
they,
in
a
simple
manner
of
speaking,
want
to
have
it
both
ways.
they
want
us
to
be
excluded
solely
on
the
issue
of
black
jurors,
but
they
want
the
black
juror
to
still
have
the
freedom
to
exercise
peremptory
challenges
in
any
way
they
see
fit.
we
believe
that
the
exercise
of
the
peremptory
challenge
by
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
is
the
ultimate
private
choice
and
exercised
by
the
defendant
while
performing
a
traditional
function
of
defense
counsel,
and
it
should
remain
that
way
to
preserve
the
adversarial
system
as
we
know
it.
to
stretch
the
concept
of
state
action
to
encompass
the
defense
attorney
will
undermine
the
adversarial
process.
this
court
must
ensure
the
continued
sanctity
and
right
of
a
juror...
of
a
defendant
to
be
tried
by
an
impartial
jury.
thank
you.
