oh,
but
you're
arguing
for
a
right
to
do
so,
aren't
you?
justice
stevens
for
any
reason
that
seems
acceptable
to
your
client.
justice
stevens
correct,
including
racial
animus.
justice
stevens
isn't
the
word
animus
somewhat
ambiguous?
is
it
racial
animus
to
challenge
a
person
because
the
person
is
black,
period?
i
like
blacks
very
much
but
i
just
don't
want
blacks
to
serve
on
my
jury.
is
that
racial
animus?
justice
stevens
i
really
don't
understand
why
the
jury
is
any
different
from
the
trial
judge
in
that
respect.
they
both
are,
in
a
sense,
agents
of
the
state,
making
decisions
that
vitally
affect
your
future.
they
may
be
for
you
or
against
you,
but
they're
still...
aren't
they
spokesman
for
the
sovereign
when
they
act
and
return
their
verdict?
justice
stevens
so's
the
judge
in
the
same
sense.
justice
stevens
they're
surely
not
an
agent
of
the
defendant.
justice
stevens
well,
they're
not
wholly
independent.
they
have
to
follow
the
law,
too.
