justice
o'connor
mr.
kohler
what
do
you
do
about
our
holding
in
polk
county
v.
dodson
that
public
defenders
do
not
act
under
color
of
state
law--
justice
o'connor
--when
they're
representing
a
criminal
defendant?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
results
in
a
rather
peculiar
distinction,
don't
you
think?
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
that
wasn't
my
view,
but
i
recognize
that's
the
holding
of
the
court.
justice
o'connor
mr.
kohler,
would
you
have
any
idea
of
how
frequently
there
are
appeals
on
the
basis
of
disagreement
with
the
reasons
given
and
accepted
by
the
court
for...
under
the
batson
inquiry?
justice
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
you
would
not
extend
that
same
inquiry
to
peremptories
exercised
on
the
basis
of
gender,
then?
justice
o'connor
i
think
that's
rather
hard
to
defend
if
the
court
has,
of
course,
under
the
very
same
provisions
that
protect
against
racial
discrimination
applied
a
form
of
heightened
scrutiny
to
gender-based
discrimination.
how
do
you
justify
that
position?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
think
that
the
cases
from
this
court
dealing
with
batson
and
edmondson
have
resorted
to
reliance
on
that
difference
in
the
level
of
scrutiny,
do
you?
