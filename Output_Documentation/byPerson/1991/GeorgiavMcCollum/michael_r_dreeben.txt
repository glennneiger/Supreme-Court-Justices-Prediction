mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
the
constitution
bars
the
exercise
of
a
racially
motivated
peremptory
challenge
by
a
criminal
defendant.
a
state
may
not
delegate
to
a
defendant
the
power
to
deny
a
citizen
the
opportunity
for
jury
service
because
of
that
person's
race.
that
result
is
invidious
and
is
attributable
to
the
state,
regardless
of
the
party
that
initiates
the
challenge.
if
defendants
were
permitted
to
exercise
race-based
strikes
and
exclude
jurors
solely
because
of
assumptions
about
whether
they
could
be
fair,
grounded
in
their
race,
it
would
undermine
public
confidence
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
the
government
has
taken--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
the
government's
view
that
is
not
a
problem.
those
are
consistent
with
what
the
peremptory
challenge
was
designed
to
do
originally,
which
is
to
allow
jurors
to
improve
the
sense
that...
to
allow
defendants
to
have
an
improved
sense
of
confidence
in
the
jury
that
will
decide
their
case.
that's
why,
in
fact,
the
state
gives
defendants
the
right
to
participate
in
what
would
otherwise
be
an
exclusively
governmental
function,
but
this
court
has
noted
in
many
of
its
opinions
that
race
is
a
particularly
suspect
and
invidious
ground
on
which
to
exercise
governmental
power,
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
going
on
when
a
criminal
defendant
takes
advantage
of
a
state-provided
right
and
chooses
to
exclude
a
juror
from
service.
the
law
does
provide
many
specific
means
for
testing
the
ability
of
jurors
to
be
fair.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
whether
a
juror
can
serve
in
an
unbiased
capacity
and
decide
a
case.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
state
can
license
a
defendant
to
act
out
of
pure
racial
bias
and
prejudice
and
deny
a
citizen
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
a
juror
regardless
of
whether
he
could
be
fair
under
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
would
not,
justice
o'connor.
we
believe--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
court
has
applied
a
higher
level
of
equal
protection
and
scrutiny
to
race
than
it
has
to
gender.
it
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
experiences
of
this
country--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
determine
how
conventional
equal
protection
jurisprudence
fits
in
with
the
application
of
the
constitution
for
a
peremptory
challenge.
it's
a
difficult
process,
because
the
peremptory
challenge
itself
is
grounded
on
the
assumption
that
parties
can
use
it
whether
or
not
it
is
rational.
it
is
somewhat
of
an
exception
to
the
conventional
analysis
that
equal
protection
requires
a
government
action.
the
basis
for
it
is
that
the
state
can
make
the
assumption
that
it
is
rational
to
allow
parties
to
remove
people
without
giving
a
reason
in
order
to
improve
confidence
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
i
think
that
supports
overriding
the
rights
of
postmen
not
to
be
excluded.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
claim
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
assumption
is
that
a
black
juror
cannot
possibly
be
fair
when
a
racial
crime
is
involved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
it
represents
a
prediction
based
on
anything
that
can
be
identified,
and
therefore
it
is
attributable
to
what
is
characterized
as
bias.
that
is
the
foundation
of
this
court's
ruling
in
batson,
which
applies
precisely
when
a
prosecutor
makes
the
assumption
without
any
evidence,
any
supporting
facts,
that
a
particular
individual
juror
cannot
vote
fairly
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin.
that
is
the
entire
underpinning
of
this
court's
rule
that
it
violates
the
constitution
for
a
prosecutor
to
remove
jurors
on
grounds
of
race.
the
government
submits
that
the
same
rule
applies
equally
when
the
defendant
takes
advantage
of
the
state-created
power
of
a
peremptory
challenge
to
a
juror.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
slander
of
postmen
in
any
sense
comparable
to
the
invidious
connotations
that
this
court
has
assigned
to
race-based
classifications.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
kennedy.
we're
not
suggesting
that
prosecutors
should
or
do
go
out
and
make
the
assumption
that
women
can't
be
fair
jurors.
what
we
do
submit
is
that
the
batson
rule
and
the
allowance
of
particularized
challenges
in
individual
cases
marked
a
departure
from
swain
v.
alabama
precisely
because
there
have
been
a
widespread,
persistent
problem
with
respect
to
the
striking
of
black
jurors.
there
really
is
nothing
in
the
system
that
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there's
a
similar
problem
with
respect
to
gender,
and
so
you
have
the
task
of
balancing
the
additional
costs
for
the
system
of
justice
in
creating
a
batson-type
rule
for
gender--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
can
happen
and
it
has
happened
in
particular
cases.
we
submit
only
that
the
problem
is
not
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
it
can
happen.
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
in
the
peremptory
challenge
area
if
the
challenge
is
to
be
preserved
at
all,
because
it
is
exercised
without
reason,
and
if
the
peremptory
challenge
is
to
be
held
compatible
with
equal
protection
principles
some
classes
will
be
excluded
on
grounds
that
would
not
otherwise
justify
government
action.
this
case,
of
course,
doesn't
present
that
extension
of
batson.
what
this
case
presents
is
a
classic
application
of
batson
in
an
area
where
the
state
has
provided
the
mechanism
for
both
parties
to
participate--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
edmondson
clearly
disposes
of
the
question
of
whether
state
action
is
present
when
a
criminal
defendant
acts
on
a
peremptory
challenge.
the
only
remaining
issue
at
all
is
whether
polk
county
v.
dodson
suggests
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
a
state
actor
in
this
situation.
we
submit
that
that
case
does
not
require
the
result
that
the
defendant
is
not
a
state
actor.
polk
county
considered
the
general
actions
of
a
defense
lawyer
who
is
employed
by
the
state
and
concluded
that
despite
his
employment
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
is
not
properly
characterized
as
a
state
actor.
polk
county,
of
course,
had
no
occasion
to
consider
the
particular
function
of
peremptory
challenge,
which
differs
in
many
respects
from
what
a
defense
lawyer
usually
does.
it's
not
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
remove
jurors
for
no
reason
at
all.
it
is
something
solely
derived
from
the
state's
power,
and
it
involves
the
defense
lawyer
just
as
it
involves
civil
litigants
in
the
task
of
selecting
government
officials
in
such
a
way
that
discrimination
should
be
fairly
attributed
to
the
state
and
should
be
forbidden
under
this
court's
decisions.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--thank
you.
