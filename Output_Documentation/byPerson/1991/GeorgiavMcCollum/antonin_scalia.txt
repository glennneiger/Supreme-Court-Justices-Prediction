before
you
do
that--
justice
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
you've
been
asked
whether
the
state
finds
it
oppressive.
the
state
doesn't
have
a
number
of
years
in
prison
at
stake.
don't
you
think
it
might
be
an
important
consideration
for
the
defendant--
justice
scalia
--especially...
not
just
in
an
interracial
crime,
but
where
the
crime
is
alleged
to
have
been
racially
motivated.
let's
say
a
white
defendant
who's
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan,
or
a
black
defendant
who's
a
member
of
some
black
racial
group
accused
of
murdering
a
white
person
out
of
racial
animus.
don't
you
think
that
that
person
ought
to...
would
feel
differently
than
you
do
about
well,
it
makes
no
difference
if
i
could
strike
every
person
on
the
basis
of
peremptory
challenges?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
bias.
i'm
just
talking
about...
you
give
the
defendant
peremptories.
the
whole
purpose
of
peremptories
is
that
you
don't
have
to
show
bias.
you
just
think
you'll
get
a
fairer
shake
from
a
jury
if
you
just
out
of
suspicion
can
strike
a
certain
number
of
people,
and
you're
going
to
let
the
defendant
strike
postmen,
you're
going
to
let
him
strike
people
above
a
certain
age,
right...
all
of
those
things
not
because
he
knows
that
they're
biased,
but
because
he
thinks
i
think
i'll
get
a
better
shake
from
an
all-female
jury
or
an
all-male
jury,
or
a
jury
without
postmen,
or
a
jury
without
ex-policemen,
or
whatever,
right?
except
the
one
thing
you
can't
do,
even
though
this
is
a...
you
know,
an
allegedly
racially
motivated
crime,
is
use
those
peremptories
with
respect
to
people...
i
think
that's
a
real
incursion
upon
the
defendant's
ability
to
assure
a
jury
that
he's
satisfied
what
is
fair.
justice
scalia
do
you
favor
peremptories
generally,
or--
justice
scalia
--i
mean,
i
would
think
that
that
position
leads
to
the
position
that
you
shouldn't
have
peremptories.
justice
scalia
but
sex
is
all
right--
justice
scalia
--or
age
is
all
right,
or
employment
is
all
right.
you
can
discriminate
on
all
those
bases
without
undermining
confidence.
you
can
try
to
get
an
all-male
jury
or
an
all-female
jury,
or
is
that
a
problem,
too?
justice
scalia
well,
mr.
dreeben,
you
characterize
this
as
not
being...
the
defendant
doesn't
have
the
right
to
strike
somebody
out
of
bias
or
prejudice.
there's
no
bias.
why
is
there
bias
or
prejudice
involved,
i
mean,
more
than
there
is
with
striking
a
postmen?
i
have
nothing
against
postmen.
i
just
happen
to
think
that
postmen
don't
give
judgments
in
my
favor
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
why
is
that
bias
or
prejudice?
justice
scalia
the
same
thing
with
striking...
a
racial
strike.
i
have
nothing
against
the
people
of
that
race.
i
just
think...
my
calculation
is
i
would
do
better
with
a
jury
of
a
different...
what
is
biased
or
prejudiced
about
that?
justice
scalia
that's
not
the
assumption
at
all.
the
assumption
is
simply
the
probabilities
are
that
a
black
juror
would
be
more
likely
to
vote
against
me,
just
as
the
probabilities
are
that
a
postman
would
or
that
a
woman
would,
or
whatever
arbitrary
class
you
pick.
i
don't
see
why
it
reflects
bias
or
prejudice.
it
reflects
a
prediction
of
how
that
person
is
likely
to
vote
in
the
case.
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
be
able
to
slander
postmen
that
way
either.
if
that's
the
kind
of
a
judgment
it
reflects,
i
think
it's
terrible.
justice
scalia
you
might
even
be
willing
to
concede,
mightn't
you,
as
far
as
your
case
is
concerned,
that
if
it
were
demonstrated
that
the
strike
was
made
out
of
racial
animus
as
far
as
you're
concerned
that'd
be
okay.
you're
not
trying
to
strike
people
because
you
don't
like
the
particular
race.
you
just
think
that
you're
likely
to
get
a
better
verdict
from
someone
of
a
different
race,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
would
you
be
satisfied
with
a
holding
that
said
you
can't
strike
a
juror
because
of
racial
animus
but
you
can
use
race
as
one
of
the
probabilities
in
deciding
what
kind
of
a
jury
to
pick?
justice
scalia
but
our
holdings
to
date,
edmondson
and
so
forth,
don't
hinge
upon
animus
at
all,
do
they?
they
just
say
you
cannot
use
race
as
a
factor,
right,
whether
it's
animosity
toward
that
race
or
not?
