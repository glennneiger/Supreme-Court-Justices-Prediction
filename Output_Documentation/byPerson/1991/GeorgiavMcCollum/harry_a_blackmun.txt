91-372,
georgia
against
mccollum.
the
respondents
who
are
white
were
charged
with
assaulting
two
african-americans.
before
the
jury
selection
began,
the
trial
judge
denied
the
prosecution
to
motion
to
prohibit
the
defendants
from
exercising
preemptory
challenges
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
the
georgia
supreme
court
affirmed
and
distinguished
a
recent
case
here
where
this
court
had
held
that
private
litigants
cannot
exercise
preemptory
strikes
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
hold
that
the
constitution
prohibits
a
criminal
defendant
from
engaging
in
purposeful
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
race
in
the
exercise
of
preemptory
challenges.
doing
this
inflicts
the
harms
addressed
in
the
batson
case
decided
here
sometime
ago.
a
criminal
defendant's
exercise
of
preemptory
challenges
constitutes
state
action.
the
state
has
third
party
standing
to
challenge
the
defendants'
discriminatory
use
of
challenges
and
the
prohibition
does
not
violate
a
criminal
defendant's
constitutional
right.
the
chief
justice,
while
joining
the
opinion,
has
filed
a
concurring
statement;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
o'connor
and
justice
scalia
each
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
