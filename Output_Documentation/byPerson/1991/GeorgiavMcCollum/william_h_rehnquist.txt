chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-372,
georgia
v.
thomas
mccollum.
mr.
kohler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
in
every
criminal
case,
you
get
that
number
of
peremptories
in
charges?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
trial
here
hasn't
taken
place,
has
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
if
you
win
the
trial
court
when
it
does
try
the
case
would,
as
justice
white
suggests
i
suppose,
require
that
any
challenge
of
a
black
juror
by
a
defendant
just
as
by
the
state
be
supported
by
a
reason
if
the
batson
test
is
met.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
get
any
substantial
number
of
reversals
on
appeal
because
of
claimed
batson
violations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kohler.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
a
classic
application
of
batson
after
the
edmondson
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
revell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
revell,
what
about
the
situation
where
say
the
state
of
georgia
had
sued
your
client
civilly,
not
criminally?
do
you
think
your
client
then
would
be
barred
from
excluding
blacks
from
a
jury
under
batson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
your
case
is
still
different
from
that
because
you're
defending
against
the
government
in
a
criminal
action.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
in
a
civil
action
brought
by
the
government,
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
what
respect--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--other
than
the
obvious,
that
in
a
criminal
action
the
defendant
faces
the
possibility
of
imprisonment.
in
a
civil
action
it
probably
faces
just
the
prospect
of
money
damages.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
they're
operating
under
civil
rules
rather
than
criminal
rules?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you
say
they're
both
operating
under
civil
rules
in
a
civil
case,
you
would
have
to
say
they
were
both
operating
under
criminal
rules
in
a
criminal
case,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
thinking
of
the
georgia
constitution
or
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
one
of
those
rights
given
by
the
constitution
is
not
the
right
to
make
peremptory
challenges,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
if
we
rule
against
you
here,
you're
going
to
be
in
better...
a
criminal
defendant
is
going
to
be
in
better
shape
than
the
prosecution
insofar
as
appealing
adverse
rulings.
i
mean,
after
the
trial
is
over,
if
the
jury
brings
in
a
verdict
of
acquittal
there's
nothing
the
state
can
do
to
take
up
the
question
of
whether
perhaps
some
of
your
strikes
should
have
been
overruled
because
of
batson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we're
going
to
have
to
do
that
for
the
prosecution
and
for
attorneys
in
private
civil
litigations
as
the
law
stands
now,
are
we
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
revell.
mr.
kohler,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
