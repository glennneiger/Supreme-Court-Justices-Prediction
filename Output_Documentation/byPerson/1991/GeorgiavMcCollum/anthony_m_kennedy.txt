justice
kennedy
so
under
georgia
law
the
attorneys
can
each
voir
dire
each
one
of
the
jurors.
justice
kennedy
do
you
think
if
counsel
in
a
criminal
case
excused
a
juror
and
the
allegation
was
excusal
was
on
the
basis
of
race
that
there'd
be
a
1983
suit
that
could
be
brought
against
the
counsel
by
the
excluded
jurors?
justice
kennedy
absent
the
creation
of
some
sort
of
privilege
or
immunity.
justice
kennedy
on
the
gender
question
you're
not
of
course
suggesting,
i
take
it,
that
the
stereotypical
judgment
based
on
sex
has
any
more
validity
than
the
stereotypic
judgment
based
on
race.
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
we're
just
in
the
process
of
seeing
many
causes
of
action
created
to
protect
women,
and
i
assume
that
you
would
have
a
number
of
cases
in
which
an
all-male
or
an
all-female
jury
would
be
of
advantage
to
one
side
or
the
other--
justice
kennedy
--if
you
assume
a
stereotypic
attitude.
justice
kennedy
would
you
say
that
the
only
things
that
stand
between
them
are
the
attorney,
the
jury,
and
the
law?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
we
have
here
on
voir
dire
a
black
juror
said
to
you
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i'm
very
affronted
by
an
assault
against
someone
of
my
race
and
i
don't
think
i
could
put
my
race
out
of
my
mind
in
deciding
this
case.
that
would
be
a
very
important
factor
for
me
in
deciding
the
case.
you
don't
think
we
would
prevent
you
from
disqualifying
the
juror
on
the
grounds
of
bias,
do
you?
justice
kennedy
so
that
i've
just
demonstrated
to
you,
and
i
think
you
agree,
that
race
can
be
a
factor
in
excusal
of
the
juror
if
it
indicates
that
the
juror
is...
is
not
impartial.
