justice
souter
well,
let's
assume
that's
so.
the
judge
is
always
a
state
actor,
you
agree
with
that.
justice
souter
isn't
the
judge
the
person
who
ultimately
excuses
the
challenged
juror,
so
that
even
if
we
accept
your
theory
that
the
defense
counsel
can't
change
hats
all
the
time
the
court
is
still
going
to
be
engaged
in
state
action,
and
if
the
court
does
it
at
the
behest
of
someone
acting
from
racial
animus
the
court
partakes
of
that
animus,
and
doesn't
that
compel
the
same
result?
justice
souter
well,
what
about
the
case
in
which
there
is
objection
to
the
exercise
of
the
peremptory
challenge
because
it's
being
exercised
from
racial
animus?
that
takes
care
of
your
argument,
doesn't
it?
justice
souter
isn't...
let's
assume
that
there's
an
objection
to
the
peremptory
challenge,
and
the
objection
is
the
challenge
is
being
exercised
out
of
racial
animus.
the
judge
rules
on
that.
at
that
point,
if
the
judge
says
yes,
it
is
being
exercised
out
of
racial
animus
but
that's
no
fault
of
mine,
at
that
point
even
on
your
argument
the
judge
is
in
fact
actively
engaging
in
the
process.
