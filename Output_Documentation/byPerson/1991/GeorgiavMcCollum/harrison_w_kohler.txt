mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
prohibits
a
criminal
defendant
from
exercising
his
peremptory
strikes
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
respondents
assert
that
under
the
facts
of
their
case
they
have
the
right
to
use
their
peremptory
strikes
to
excuse
black
jurors
under
the
assumption
that
because
these
jurors
are
black
they
cannot
be
impartial
in
this
case.
the
georgia
supreme
court
agreed,
and
held
that
the
constitution
did
not
prohibit
criminal
defendants
from
racial
discrimination
in
the
exercise
of
peremptory
strikes.
the
state
of
georgia
submits
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
wrong.
this
court
has
stated
clearly
that
racial
discrimination
in
the
exercise
of
peremptory
strikes
violates
the
equal
protection
rights
of
the
challenged
jurors
and
harms
the
state's
interest
in
maintaining
public
confidence
in
the
fairness
of
judicial
proceedings.
this
court
has
already
held
that
prosecutors
cannot
exercise
their
peremptory
strikes
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
civil
litigants,
neither
plaintiffs
nor
defendants
can
do
so.
criminal
defendants
should
be
similarly
barred.
this
court
has
noted
in
a
number
of
decisions
that
peremptory
strikes
are
not
of
constitutional
origin.
they
are
creations
of
statute.
if
georgia
so
chose
it
could
summon
jurors
to
the
court,
conduct
the
voir
dire
to
determine
which
of
those
jurors
were
partial,
exclude
those
jurors,
and
require
the
state
and
the
criminal
defendant
to
go
to
trial
without
any
peremptory
strikes.
i
would
submit
that
such
a
procedure
would
be
constitutional.
instead,
georgia
has
chosen
to
delegate
to
the
criminal
prosecutor
and
the
criminal
defendant
significant
state
power
to
determine
the
composition
of
the
jury.
under
georgia
law
in
practically
all
felony
trials
42
jurors
are
impaneled
for
jury
service.
the
state
has
the
right
to
exclude
10
jurors
with
peremptory
strikes.
georgia
has
delegated
to
the
criminal
defendant
power
to
exclude
20
jurors...
almost
50
percent
of
the
jury
panel.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
your
honor,
in
all
felonies
where
the
punishment
is
greater
than
3
years,
which
includes
almost
every
felony
in
georgia,
it
is
20
and
10.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
edmondson
there
is
state
action
throughout
the
jury
selection
process.
in
georgia,
county
officials,
jury
commissioners
compose
the
jury
list,
the
clerk's
office
of
the
superior
court
sends
out
a
summons
directing
the
jurors
to
report
in
the
courtroom,
bailiffs
who
are
deputy
sheriffs
of
the
sheriff's
office
escort
the
jurors
to
and
from
the
assembly
room
to
the
courtroom,
in
the
courtroom
jurors
in
a
criminal
case
are
given
up
to
three
oaths...
these
are
all
by
georgia
statute...
and
the
second
oath
that
is
given
to
all
42
jurors
on
the
panel
is
that
they
will
truthfully
answer
the
questions
propounded
to
them,
and
then
during
the
voir
dire
the
judge
requires
that
the
jury
answer
those
questions
that
are
propounded
to
them
by
the
attorneys
in
the
case.
once
the
voir
dire
has
concluded,
the
peremptory
strikes
are
exercised.
after
those
strikes
are
exercised,
it
is
the
judge
that
directs
the
12
jurors
remaining
these
are
the
jurors
you
will
serve
in
this
case,
you're
directed
to
enter
the
jury
box,
and
the
other
jurors
are
excused
by
the
court
generally
to
return
to
the
jury
assembly
room.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
individual
voir
dire
of
the
jury.
now,
the
court
does
not
have
to
sequester
the
other
jurors
separately
from
that.
generally
the
court
will
empanel
12
jurors
in
the
box
but
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
individual
voir
dire.
jury
selection
in
georgia
does
go
fairly
fast.
not
as
quickly
as
the
federal
courts,
but
in
most
cases
a
jury
will
be
empaneled
in
two
or
three
hours,
even...
with
the
exception
of
a
capital
case.
it
is
the
state
of
georgia's
position
that
when
a
criminal
defendant
is
exercising
this
state
delegated
power
to
exclude
jurors
from
the
jury,
he
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
this
is
a
right
created
by
statute,
and
although
the
state
may
delegate
this
power
to
the
defendant
in
the
case,
it
is
the
position
of
georgia
that
the
state
may
not
license
the
defendant
to
exercise
these
peremptory
strikes
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
it
is
also
the
position
of
the
state
of
georgia
that
the
attorney
general
has
standing
to
assert
these
equal
protection
rights
on
behalf
of
the
jurors.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
your
honor--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--justice
o'connor,
my
reading
of
polk
county
v.
dodson
was
that
in
the
filing,
or
in
that
case
the
not
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal
the
public
defender
was
not
acting
under
color
of
state
law
because
he
was
performing
a
private
act
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
it
is
our
reading
of
edmondson
that
when
the
criminal
defendant
or
counsel
is
exercising
that
state-created
power
to
exclude
jurors,
and
the
criminal
defense
attorney
excludes
them
on
the
basis
of
race
alone,
that
he
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
we
are
not
asserting
to
the
court
that
in
every
case
defense
counsel
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
but
only
in
the
exercise
of
the
state-created
power
of
peremptory
strikes.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
your
honor,
i
would...
no,
because
i
believe
that
what
the
state
is
asserting
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
what
the
majority
opinion
in
edmondson.
in
that
case,
you
had
private
litigants
but
this
court
held
that
in
the
exercise
i
believe
of
three
peremptory
strikes
they
were
acting
under
color
of--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--yes,
ma'am,
and
we
believe
that
the
majority
opinion
does
support
the
state
of
georgia's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
justice
kennedy,
in
theory,
yes.
as
a
practical
matter,
given
the
way
jury
selection
works,
i
think
it
would
be
highly
unlikely,
but
in
theory
yes,
i
believe
the
excluded
juror
would
have
the
authority
to
bring
a
1983
action
against
the
counsel.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
correct,
if
there
were
within
the
four
corners
of
the
courtroom
that
the
defense
counsel
are
immune
from
any
damages,
of
course,
in
that
case,
that
would
prohibit
it.
the
attorney
general
is
not
representing
a
private
party
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
but
the
state
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
public
confidence
in
judicial
proceedings.
this
interest
is
harmed
when
the
public
perceives
that
in
a
criminal
case
racial
discrimination
occurs
in
the
exercise
of
peremptory
strikes.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
yes.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
well,
that's
certainly
one
of
the
options
that
this
court--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--well,
your
honor,
i
certainly
wasn't
arguing
for
the
practicality
of
it,
and
the
obstacles
might
be
daunting.
just
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
powers,
the
ability
or
the
obstacles
to
a
juror's
asserting
his
right
is
daunting,
but
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
believe
that
if
there
were
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination,
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
was
incorrect,
that
the
court
could
require
that
defense
counsel,
just
like
he
can
the
state,
give
a
neutral
nonrace-based
reason
for
the
exclusion
of
the
black
juror.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
no,
your
honor,
it
has
not.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position
exactly,
that...
and
again,
the
state
has
operated
under
the
principles
of
batson
since
1986,
and
it
has
not
prevented
the
state
from
empaneling
impartial
juries.
i
would
submit
that
two
things
have
resulted
from
batson
from
the
prosecutorial
point
of
view.
one
is
i
think
a
practical
fact,
as
a
matter
of
fact
more
black
jurors
serve
on
criminal
juries.
the
second
is...
i
think
a
practical
result
is
that
it
has
made
prosecutors
better
at
jury
selection
because
it
has
forced
us
to
make
an
individualized
assessment
of
the
jury
as
opposed
to
relying
on
some
kind
of
racial
stereotype
as
to
the
ideal
state's
juror
or
the
ideal
defendant's
juror,
so
it's
something
that
the
prosecutor
is
able
to
accept.
civil
litigants
now
have
to
do
the
same,
and
it's
the
state
of
georgia's
position--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--i
can't
speak
for
myself.
i've
certainly
talked
with
prosecutors
about
it.
i
certainly
think
there
are
some
of
us
that
feel
that
it
is
not,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
instead
of
making
the
assumption
that
the
ideal
prosecution
juror
in
my
part
of
the
country
is
a
white
farmer
who
was
in
the
marine
corps,
we
would
try
to
look
at
the
specific
juror
and
try
to
make
an
individualized
assessment.
and
i
think
in
hindsight
i
can
look
back
on
my
own
jury
selection
in
cases
and
i've
tried
a
number
of
them
where
i
feel
i
probably
did
not
do
a
good
job,
and
batson
has
forced
us
to
focus
on
what
is
significant
in
the
case,
and
that
is
try
to
make
as
best
we
can
an
individualized
assessment.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
no,
your
honor,
i
can
think
of
one
case
early.
i
don't
recall
that
there
are
very
many.
i
would
like
to
think
that
that's
because
we
comply
with
batson.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
what
you
all
say
the
law
is,
and
we
comply
with
it
and
therefore
if
we
are
in
a
case
and
strike
a
black
juror
and
the
court
says
what's
your
neutral
reason
then
we
give
a
neutral
reason.
if
not,
there
have
been
cases
in
georgia,
both
at
least
one
in
federal
court
and
one
in
state
court,
i
think,
where
the
judge
was
not
satisfied
and
put
the
juror
or
jurors
back
on
the
jury.
now,
that
has
happened,
too,
but
in
those
cases
there
was
a
conviction
even
though
the
court
at
least
as
to
some
jurors
did
not
accept
the
neutral
explanation.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
there
certainly...
it's
not
unusual,
and
there
certainly
are
appeals
on
that
issue.
i
would
like
to
say
my
own
experience...
and
i'm
not
up
here
saying
to
the
court
that
my
experience
is
statistically
significant,
but
there
are
cases
that
you
try,
interracial
crimes,
where
there's
no
batson
challenge,
and
simply
because
there
is
an
interracial
crime
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
batson
will
arise.
we
have
had
civil
cases
where
the
state
was
a
party
to
the
civil
action
where
we
have
represented
black
defendants
in
state
and
federal
court
going
in
expecting
to
make
a
challenge
and
find
that
we
did
not
make
any
challenge.
so
i
believe
it
is
not
true
that
in
every
case
where
we
try
one
of
these
cases
there
is
automatically
a
batson
challenge.
your
honor,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
your
honor--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
the
court,
and
may
i
explain.
one
is
that
the
state
is
not
saying
if
a
juror
is
in
fact
biased
that
he
should
sit,
or
if
there
is
a
neutral
reason,
but
there
are
other
methods
approved
by
the
court
for
determination
of
how
to
exercise
peremptory
strikes
as
appropriate
voir
dire.
if
the
evidence
in
the
case--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--your
honor,
i
would
simply
respectfully
disagree,
that
the
state
of
georgia's
position
that
simply
striking
a
juror
under
the
assumption
that
because
a
juror
is
of
a
particular
race,
whether
white
or
black,
that
that
is
not
sufficient,
that
if
there's
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination,
neutral
reasons
should
have
to
be
given.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
your
honor--
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
--your
honor,
i
believe
a
small
number
of
peremptories
are
desirable.
i
do
not
believe
they
are
essential.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
in
georgia
is
there
are
so
many
peremptories
granted...
10
and
20...
that
the
potential
for
abuse
is
great
because
you
do
not
simply
eliminate
that
one
or
two
jurors
that
you
suspect
in
your
heart
as
not
being...
or
will
not
be
fair,
but
there
is
the
encouragement
to
eliminate
entire
groups
of
people.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
raised
in
my
motion
to
the
trial
court,
even
though
dougherty
county
has
a
substantial
black
population...
about
43
percent...
potentially,
if
the
defendant
is
of
a
mind
to
and
the
42
jurors
mirror
the
population,
he
can
remove
the
entire
group
of
people,
not
simply
jurors
that
he
might
suspect
might
not
be
fair.
i
would
respectfully
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
harrison
w.
kohler
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
questions
i
will
waive
the
remainder
of
my
time.
