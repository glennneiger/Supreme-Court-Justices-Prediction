justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
foreign
sub
has
paid
a
tax
on
its
earnings
abroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
well
as
withheld
on
the
dividends
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
foreign
sub
that
does
business
only
in
the
foreign
country,
doesn't
ship
any
products
or
anything,
nothing
that
it
does
crosses
any
international
boundary.
i
suppose
you
would
say
it's
nevertheless
commerce
because
of
the
transfer
of
capital
and
funds
across
borders?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
capital
investment
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
the
rationale
of
the
iowa
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
thought
the
iowa
rationale,
iowa
supreme
court's
rationale
was
not
the
right
one?
why
wouldn't
we
remand
and
tell
them
what
standard
to
use
rather
than
try
to
decide
the
case
under
a
new
standard
that
you're
now
arguing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
completely
or
not,
it's
new.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
have
argued
it,
but
that
isn't
what
they
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
go...
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
go
ahead.
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
the
commerce
discussion
for
a
moment
earlier.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
businesses
of
the
subsidiaries,
the
foreign
subsidiaries,
are
commerce
within
different
foreign
countries
or
are
they
commerce
between
those
foreign
countries
and
the
united
states?
does
it
tell
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you,
what
if
iowa
just
taxed
dividends
from
corporations
organized
and
doing
business
in
another
state
and
didn't
tax
any,
any
other
dividends?
they
just
tax
dividends
coming
into
iowa
from
another
state.
would
that
be
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
on
the
assumption
that
you're
just
free
to
ignore
the
tax
placed
on
foreign
subsidiaries
by
the
foreign
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
not
ignoring
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
about
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
taxation
by
a
state
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
other
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mobil,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
an
iowa
corporation
that
establishes
a
subsidiary
abroad
and
that's
the
only
business
they've
got.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
income
they've
got
is,
are
dividends
from
a
foreign
corporation.
now,
iowa,
you
can't
say
that
iowa
is
taxing
the
earnings
of,
the
basic
earnings,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
either
in
iowa
or
any
other
state,
except...
let's
say
an
iowa
corporation
has
one
foreign
corporation,
one
foreign
subsidiary,
it
does
business
abroad.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
only
income
are
dividends
from
the
foreign
subsidiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
don't
you
think
in
that
case
iowa
is
discriminating
against
foreign
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
reason
you
gave
before
doesn't
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
in
the
united
states,
certainly
not
in
iowa,
are
the
earnings
of
the,
of,
that
produces
the
dividends
being
taxed?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
why
it
isn't
discriminatory.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
taxing
any
dividends
from
domestic
corporations.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
need
to?
i
mean,
it
may
not,
but
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could,
i
guess?
