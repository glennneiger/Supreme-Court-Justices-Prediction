mr.
jerome
b.
libin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
a
different
type
of
state
statute,
namely
a
taxing
statute.
it
involves
specifically
how
the
state
of
iowa
taxes
dividends
received
by
parent
companies
doing
business
there
from
their
foreign
subsidiaries
and
perhaps
domestic
subsidiaries.
petitioner
is
a
multi-state,
multinational
corporation
engaged
in
business
throughout
this
country
and
in
foreign
countries.
its
domicile
is
in
illinois,
it
does
business
in
iowa,
of
course,
and
other
states.
during
the
year
at
issue
it
received
approximately
$10
million
in
dividends
from
foreign
subsidiaries,
each
of
which
engaged
in
business
only
in
foreign
countries.
under
iowa's
law
it
was
required
to
include
those
dividends
in
its
tax
base
and
to
compute
its
iowa
income
tax
with
respect
to
those
dividends
by
full
inclusion.
had
it
received
any
dividends
from
other
subsidiaries
during
that
year
it
would
not
have
been
required
to
include
those
dividends
in
its
tax
base
under
the
iowa
law.
the
iowa
law
adopts
the
federal
internal
revenue
code
as
the
basis
for
taxation,
and
under
the
federal
internal
revenue
code
only
dividends
from
foreign
subsidiaries
doing
business
in
foreign
countries
are
required
to
be
included
in
income
and
receive
no
offsetting
deduction.
petitioner
challenged
the
iowa
statute
as
being
facially
discriminatory,
singling
out
for
inclusion
in
the
tax
base
only
the
dividends
from
foreign
subsidiaries
doing
business
in
foreign
countries.
the
iowa
court,
supreme
court,
rejected
petitioner's
challenge,
holding
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
because
it
could
find
no
basis
for
a
benefit
resulting
that
was
peculiar
to
iowa
with
respect
to
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
no,
we
do
not
request
that.
that
would
be
impermissible,
i
think,
and
the
footnote
number
30
in
container,
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
container
indicates
that
a
credit
at
the
state
level
for
foreign
taxes
paid
would
probably
not
be
permissible
because
you
already
have
received
full
credit
at
the
federal
level.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
it
certainly
has
the
power
to
tax
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
without
a
credit,
justice
o'connor,
but
what
we
believe
is
clearly
correct
under
this
court's
decisions
is
that
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
single
out
those
dividends
for
taxation
vis-a-vis
all
other
kinds
of
dividends,
because
they're,
that
is
discrimination
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
it
singles
out
dividends
generated
in
foreign
commerce
for
taxation,
it
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
dividends
generated
in
domestic
commerce.
and
under
complete
auto
in
japan
line,
the
test
for
determining
whether
a
statute
infringes
on
and
violates
the
foreign
commerce
clause
is
whether
it
is
non-discriminatory.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
many
states
do
the
same
thing.
26
of
the
states
that
piggy-back
off
of
the
federal
tax
law
have
eliminated
this
discrimination.
they
have
faced
up
to
the
problem
and
said
it
is
not
correct
to
tax
only
foreign
subsidiary
dividends,
so
we
will
either
tax
both
or
neither.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
under
the
statutory
scheme,
justice
scalia,
if
a
foreign
subsidiary
does
business
in
the
united
states
dividends
paid
by
it
to
its
parent
company
will
receive
an
offsetting
deduction
to
reflect
that
domestic
content,
so
that
there
is
symmetry
with
respect
to
that
situation
and
other
domestic
corporations.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
if
a
domestic
corporation
does
foreign
business,
then
under
the
federal
scheme,
because
it
is
a
domestic
corporation,
it
is
engaged
partly
domestic,
partly
foreign
commerce
in
that
setting,
its
dividends
are,
receive
the
benefit
of
the
deduction
because
of
the
domestic
content
again.
it
is
only
the
pure
foreign
corporation
doing
business
in
a
foreign
country
that
is
singled
out
for
taxation
without
an
offsetting
deduction.
that's
the
only
case
that
is
subject
to
tax
in
iowa.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
not
a
deduction
for
the
dividends,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
an
ability
to
deduct
the
foreign
tax
that's
withheld
on
the
dividends,
but
only
the
foreign
tax,
not
the
whole
dividend.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
iowa
allows
that
deduction
if
you
elect
to
take
a
deduction
for
withholding
taxes
rather
than
a
credit
for
the
full
amount
of
foreign
taxes
paid,
namely
both
withholding
tax
and
tax
on
the
earnings
of
the
subsidiary
that
paid
the
dividends.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
yes.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
same
amount.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
same
amount.
in
this
case
the
dividends
at
gross
were
$10
million.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
no,
there
will
always
be
discrimination
because
the
deduction
for
withholding
taxes
will
not
equal
the
full
amount
of
the
dividend
by
any
means,
it's
just
the
tax
piece.
the
deduction
for
domestic
dividends
is
the
full
amount
of
the
dividend.
it
becomes
awash
for
tax
purposes
if
the
dividend
has
domestic
content.
you
put
it
into
income,
you
take
it
out
of
income.
on
the
foreign
side
you
put
it
into
income,
the
most
you
can
deduct
is
the
withholding
tax
piece
of
that,
which
might
be
10
or
15
percent
of
the
dividend,
whatever
the
rate
is
in
the
foreign
country.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
that's
all
you
deduct.
the
balance
remains
subject
to
tax,
and
it's
the
only
situation
where
there's
tax.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
not
a
credit.
you
have
a
choice
under
federal
law,
credit
or
deduction
for
the
tax.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
yes,
it
is,
justice
rehnquist,
because
the
dividends
that
it
pays
to
its
parent
in
iowa
are
taxed
in
iowa.
the
domestic
subsidiary's
dividends
are
not
taxed.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
it's
income
is
taxed
in
iowa,
that's
correct,
but
that's
a
totally
different
tax
on
a
totally
different
entity
for
a
totally
different--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--well,
we
don't
believe
that's
quite
the
test,
your
honor.
we
believe
in
the
foreign
area
the
question
is
whether
it
favors
domestic
corporations
generally
over
foreign
corporations.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
we
think
it
does
even
there
if
we
applied
your
test,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
under
the
armco
analysis
it
would
be
appropriate
to
look
at
the
fact
that
iowa's
tax
on
earnings
would
be
applied
by
other
jurisdictions
as
well.
so
that
all
subsidiaries,
it
can
be
assumed,
pay
tax
on
their
earnings,
yet
only
the
foreign
subsidiary
has
its
dividends
taxed.
and
we
believe
that
even
under
that
analysis
there
is
discrimination
under
the
iowa
law
with
respect
to--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--yes,
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
on
the
dividend
itself,
correct,
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case.
exactly
right.
and
for
that
reason
the
iowa
tax,
in
our
judgment,
facially
discriminates
against
one
category
of
dividend
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others,
and
there
is
no
benefit
to
iowa
companies
or
to
domestic
companies
generally.
they
are,
the
foreign
subsidiaries
are
singled
out
for
the
burden
imposed
by
the
iowa
statute.
now,
the
respondent
and
the
united
states
undertake
to
suggest
perhaps
that
there's
really
no
commerce
involved
here
for
some
reason,
it's
really
only
a
matter
of
place
of
incorporation.
but
as
we
have
indicated
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
the
taxing
scheme,
it
is
a
combination
of
commerce
and
structure
that
is
relevant
here,
and
therefore
clearly
commerce
is
totally
involved
in
this.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
yes
we
would,
justice
white,
exactly
right.
the
dividend
remittance
itself
is
a
part
of
commerce.
i
think
the
mobil
case
indicates--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--correct,
the
formation
of
the
subsidiary
in
the
first
place,
exactly.
so
there
can't
be
any
question
that
foreign
commerce
is
fully
implicated
in
this
case.
and
we
think
that
the
suggestions
of
the
respondent
that
we
could
avoid
this
problem
by
using
domestic
subsidiaries
is
simply
not
appropriate
because,
as
was
stipulated
in
this
case,
there
are
many
reasons
why
corporations
seeking
to
do
business
in
foreign
countries
must
use
foreign
subsidiaries,
either
because
the
law
requires
it
to
do
business
there
or
perhaps
to
own
property
there
or
to
manufacture
there.
that
was
stipulated
by
the
parties.
as
well
as
the
commercial,
the
obvious
commercial
advantages
of
being
locally
identified,
of
being
able
to
perhaps
deal
more
easily
with
banks
and
with
other
creditors,
and
to
market
goods
with
local
identification.
so
the
suggestion
that
has
been
offered
here
by
respondent
that
there
may
be
a
way
to
avoid
this
problem
by
using
domestic
corporations
is
simply
not
a
viable
suggestion
in
our
opinion.
we
also
think
that
the
notion
of
a
domestic
holding
company,
which
was
also
proposed,
to
own
the
stocks
of
foreign
subsidiaries--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--well,
number
one,
we're
not
clear
on
exactly
how
it
works,
frankly.
it
was
sort
of
unsolicited
tax
advice
that
we
received.
but
i
think
respondent
suggests
that
you
must
do
this
outside
of
iowa
because
iowa
would
tax
these
dividends
when
they
were
paid
to
the
foreign,
to
the
domestic
holding
company,
and
if
you
assume
every
state
has
iowa's
tax,
which
is
a
perfectly
appropriate
assumption
in
issues
of
this
sort,
then
it,
the
dividends
would
be
taxed
by
any
state
where
you
formed
a
holding
company.
ultimately
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
not
being
free
to
make
a
tax
neutral
decision,
as
many
cases
in
this
court
have
indicated
is
one
of
the
values
recognized
by
the
commerce
clause,
that
state
laws
that
effectively
induce
you
or
require
you
to
make
a
decision
as
to
how
to
operate
because
of
tax
considerations
violate
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
they
give
you
choices,
obviously,
in
the
original
structure
of
your
operations.
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
i
think
we
have
seen
in
the
halliburton
case,
for
example,
where
there
was
a
use
tax
imposed
for
property
bought
or
manufactured
or
self-constructed
outside
of
louisiana
and
brought
into
louisiana.
one
of
the
points
the
court
made
in
striking
down
that
statute
was
that
it
basically
induced
people
to
construct
the
assets
in
louisiana,
and
it
did
so
because
of
tax
motivations,
and
therefore--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--well,
i
think
its
basic
concepts
have
been
followed
and
applied
in
cases
like
boston
stock
exchange
where
this
same
issue
was
raised.
you,
the
new
york
statute
in
boston
stock
exchange
effectively
induced
people
to
sell
their
securities
in
new
york
to
avoid
a
higher
tax,
and
therefore
it
foreclosed
a
tax
neutral
decision
on
where
to
make
the
sale.
and
certainly
in
structuring
foreign
operations
there
are
many
considerations
besides
taxes
that
must
be
taken
into
account,
and
if
it
develops
that
a
tax
law
ultimately
forecloses
those
options
because
it
directs
you
in
a
particular,
to
establish
your
structure
in
a
particular
way,
then
it
becomes
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
it
certainly
does.
the
tax
simply
cannot
be
discriminatory.
we
have
no
problem,
as
we
said,
with
iowa
taxing
these
dividends,
but
if
it's
going
to
tax
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
of
this
type
it
should
tax
all
dividends.
it
should
not
single
out
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
paid
by
foreign
corporations
doing
business
in
foreign
countries,
and
that
is
the
flaw
in
the
iowa
statute.
and
as
we
say,
26
states
that
have
adopted
the
federal
law
have
eliminated
this
discrimination.
10
states
besides
iowa
maintain
it.
not
one
of
those
states,
interestingly
enough,
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
iowa's
position
in
this
case.
there
is
no
other
state--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--i
do
not
know.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
that
is
possible,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
know,
but
they're
not
here.
they're
not
here
defending
their
own
statute.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
there's
certainly
discrimination
on
the
face
of
it
under
any
circumstances.
whether
that
unique
character
justifies
it,
we
would
say
no,
justice
kennedy,
because
that
ignores,
as
we
were
suggesting
earlier,
the
fact
that
foreign
subsidiaries
pay
taxes
in
their
foreign
countries.
they
bear
the
same
burdens
with
respect
to
the
earnings
that
they
generate
as
domestic
subsidiaries
do.
so
the
uniqueness
of
the
foreign
dividend
is
only
the
fact
that
it's
the
first
time
the
funds
come
home,
so
to
speak.
but
at
that
level,
at
the
dividend
receiving
level,
all
dividends
ought
to
be
taxed
the
same
way.
there
should
be
no
justification
for
a
state
to
single
out
dividends
received
in
foreign
commerce,
no
justification
for
that.
i
think
you
have
to
assume
equality
of
treatment
at
the
subsidiary
level
under
the
armco
case
and
others
where
you
posit
the
situation
where
if
iowa
taxes
earnings
then
we
assume
everybody
does.
but
iowa
does
and
we
test
the
statute
on
that
basis,
and
that's
the
only
appropriate
way
to
do
it.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
justice
stevens,
we
think
that
it's
imperative
to
recognize
the
fact
that
earnings
are
taxed
in
foreign
countries
as
well
as
earnings
taxed
domestically,
and
applying--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--if
that
were
not
true
i
think
the
issue
would
be
a
situation
where
you'd
have
to
decide
whether
it's
appropriate
even
to
take
the
tax
on
earnings
into
account,
because
the
subsidiary
is
a
totally
different
entity
from
the
parent
company.
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
armco
case
where
you
had
a
manufacturing,
a
tax
on
manufacturing
activity,
which
would
be
the
subsidiary's
earnings
generation,
and
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
manufactured
products
at
wholesale,
that
would
be
equivalent
to
the
dividend.
and
this
court
said
let's
see
who
pays
the
wholesale
tax,
and
it
was
only
out-of-state
people,
only
foreign
people.
and
the
fact
that
the
in-state
people
paid
the
manufacturing
tax
was
irrelevant.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
yes,
because,
the
other
answer
is
it's
not
appropriate
to
take
the
domestic
subsidiary
tax
into
account.
we're
looking
at
the
tax
on
dividends
at
the
parent
level,
and
whether
the
subsidiaries
are
taxed
at
all
in
the
first
instance
ought
to
be
irrelevant
to
how
a
state
taxes
dividends.
the
dividends
are
a
separate
item
of
income.
container
footnote
30
indicates
earnings
are
income
of
the
subsidiary.
dividends
are
income
of
the
parent.
and
your
own
dissent
in
the
mobil
case
suggests
dividends
are
not
always
paid
out
of
earnings
immediately,
they
may
not
mirror
the
earnings
of
any
given
year,
they
may
be
paid
later
or
earlier.
there
is
no
correlation
between
the
two.
so
in
our
view
as
a
threshold
it
is
inappropriate
even
to
look
at
how
subsidiaries
are
taxed.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
that
might
be
one
way
to
change
the
law.
it
would
not
eliminate
the
discrimination
necessarily
because
it
would
in
the
end
turn
on
an
arithmetical
calculation
whether
you
came
out
with
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
still
subject
to
tax
or
not.
but
the
kind
of
factor
adjustments
you're
suggesting
in
the
apportionment
formula
do
not
on
their
face
eliminate
the
issue
of
discrimination.
they
may
change
the
mathematical
outcome,
but
they
don't
eliminate
the
discrimination.
so
for
the
reasons
we
have
indicated
we
think
that
the
iowa
statute
really
is
in
violation
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause
as
being
facially
discriminatory.
we
also
believe
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
the
classification
that
iowa
has
adopted
for
dividends
here
is,
in
its
words,
based
on
the
convenience
of
following
the
federal
law.
but
the
convenience
in
adopting
the
language
of
the
federal
statute,
which
may
well
exist
for
certain
purposes,
cannot
justify
in
any
legitimate
or
rational
way
facial
discrimination
as
a
substantive
issue.
you
cannot
say,
i
assume
iowa
is
not
saying,
we
are
discriminating
between
these
categories
of
dividends
because
it's
convenient
to
discriminate.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
they
suggest
for
the
taxpayer.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
that
is
one
suggestion,
justice
scalia,
and
the
other
is
convenience
for
the
state
in
allowing
the
federal
government
to
audit
the
numbers
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
madden
case
and
the
carmichael
case
you
did
suggest
administrative
convenience
would
be
acceptable
where,
where
there
were
dissimilarly
situated
taxpayers
involved,
where
you
had
a
situation,
for
example,
where
it
was
convenient
to
impose
a
tax
on
companies
with
eight
or
more
employees,
but
not
fewer
than
eight,
because
it
just
was
too
much
of
a
burden
to
police
that.
there
were
substantive
differences
in
the
focus
of
the
discrimination.
here
dividends
received
by
parent
companies
is
just
money
flowing
up
to
the
parent
company,
and
there's
no
substantive
difference
in
the
dollars
that
are
received
when
they
are
received.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
the
factual
difference
is
where,
the
source
of
the
payment,
but
that
is,
there's
no
legitimate
basis
to
say
we're
going
to
draw
a
line
based
on
source
just
because
it's
convenient
to
do
so.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
well,
i
don't,
i
don't
think
it
really
does
because
the
point
at
issue
is
what
is
the
convenience
all
about.
the
convenience
is
on
checking
numbers
once
you
record
them.
it
does
not
mean
that
you
can
establish
a
line
between
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
and
all
other
dividends
because
it's
convenient
to
draw
that
line.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
but
the
discrimination,
justice
kennedy,
can
be
easily
dealt
with
by
doing
what
other
states
have
done
in
saying
this
is
a
category
of
dividends
we
cannot
tax.
we
don't
choose
to
tax
it
simply
because
it's
convenient
to
do
so.
that
seems
to
us
is
simply
not
a
rational
basis.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
we
agreed
with
that.
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
we
don't
dispute
that
it's
convenient
to
adopt
the
federal
scheme,
but
having
adopted
it,
it
seems
to
us
iowa
must
then
justify
the
discrimination
as
if
it
had
written
the
law
itself.
and
if
all
it
said
were
we're
going
to
discriminate
because
it's
convenient
to
do
so,
that
in
our
judgment
would
not
be
valid
under
this
court's
prior
decisions.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
hope
i
can
clarify
one
or
two
points
here.
i'd
like
to
stay
with
justice
white's
question
for
the
moment.
if
an
iowa
parent
company
had
a
kentucky
subsidiary,
did
all
its
business
in
kentucky,
and
another
subsidiary
that
did
all
its
business
in
germany,
iowa
would
not
tax
the
income
of
either
of
those
subsidiaries.
if
each
paid
a
dividend
to
the
iowa
parent,
iowa
would
tax
the
german
dividends
and
would
not
tax
the
kentucky
dividends.
that's
what
this
case
is
really
about.
iowa
excludes
dividends
from
domestic
subsidiaries
wherever
they're
located,
wherever
they
earn
their
money,
whether
it
taxes
them
or
not.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
not
if
it's
not
doing
any
business
in
iowa.
doing
business
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
they
do
not
include
the
income
of
the
subsidiary
or
the
dividends.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
even
if
it's
a
unitary
business
because
they
do
not
require
combined
reporting.
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
they
could,
but
they
have
chosen
not
to.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
difference.
the
federal
scheme
taxes
those
earnings
because
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
over
all
domestic
subsidiaries.
iowa
does
not.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
not
unless
it
has
iowa,
the
subsidiary
has
to
be
doing
business
in
iowa
before
iowa
can
tax.
the
subsidiary--
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
--even
if
it's
a
unitary
business,
that's
correct.
the
subsidiary
has
to
be
doing
business.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
because
then
the
dividends
would
be
included
in
the
parent
company's
income
except
for
the
fact
that
iowa
then
excludes
them.
they
would
have
the
ability
to
tax
the
dividends
under
mobil
because
they're
unitary,
but
iowa
chooses
to
relieve
itself
of
the
tax
when
the
dividend
is
from
a
unitary
domestic
subsidiary.
it
only
imposes
the
tax
when
the
dividend
is
from
a
unitary
foreign
subsidiary.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
libin
they
get
a
free
ride
in
iowa.
but
the
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
do
not.
thank
you
very
much.
