justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
libin,
now
i
take
it
that
under
the
federal
income
tax
code
that
there
is
a
foreign
tax
credit
and
these
dividends,
if
taxed
in
the
foreign
country,
then
a
credit
is
given
on
the
federal
income
tax,
dollar
for
dollar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
the
state
has
to
provide
a
second
dollar
of
credit,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
so
why
isn't
it
perfectly
rational
for
the
state
to
exclude,
then,
any
recognition
of
the
foreign,
or
go
ahead
and
tax
the
foreign
subsidiary
dividend?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
just
wants
to
piggy-back
on
the
federal
income
tax
law,
a
perfectly
reasonable
desire
on
the
part
of
the
state,
and
many
states
do
the
same
thing,
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
mason,
do
you
defend
the
rationale
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
the
test
it
employed
to
sustain
the
tax
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
focusing
on
whether
the
statute
benefits
in-state
business,
you
think
that's
the
correct
focus
and
test
for
a
challenge
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
isn't
the
test
that
we
would
employ
in,
when
the
challenge
is
to
foreign
commerce.
that
the
question
is
whether
it
discriminates
against
foreign
commerce
as
opposed
to
all
domestic
u.s.,
not
just
a
benefit,
or
to
the
in-state
business.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
jones,
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
payment
of
the
dividends
by
the
foreign
subsidiary
to
the
parent
in
the
u.s.
is
itself
foreign
commerce--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
that
affect
your
analysis
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
we
were
to
say
it
was,
then
how
does
that
affect
the
analysis?
does,
does
the
tax
scheme
now
facially
discriminate
against
that
stream?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
do
include
all
earned
income
of
the
subsidiary.
not
in
your
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
it's
a
unitary
business?
