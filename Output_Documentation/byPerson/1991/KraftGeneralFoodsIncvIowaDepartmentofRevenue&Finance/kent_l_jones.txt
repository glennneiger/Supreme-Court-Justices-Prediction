mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
looking
at
iowa's
entire
scheme
of
taxation,
as
this
court's
cases
say
we
must,
it
becomes
evident
that
by
including
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
in
its
tax
base
iowa
does
not
discriminate
against
foreign
commerce.
and
this
is
for
a
very
simple
reason.
both
iowa
and
the
united
states
tax
all
of
the
domestic
and
foreign
source
income
of
domestic
corporations.
they
also
tax
the
domestic
source
income
of
foreign
corporations.
but
they
tax
only
that
portion
of
the
foreign
income
of
foreign
corporations
that
is
distributed
as
dividends
to
the
united
states.
in
short,
iowa's
tax
is
less
inclusive
of
foreign
source
income
derived
by
a
foreign
subsidiary
than
it
is
either
of
domestic
or
foreign
source
income
derived
by
a
domestic
subsidiary.
for
this
simple
reason
it
cannot
be
said
that
iowa's
tax
facially
discriminates
either
against
foreign
commerce
or
against
foreign,
subsidiaries.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
that
is
in
fact
the
only
issue
of
substance
left
to
discuss,
and
i
agree,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
discuss
now.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
going
to
ignore
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
just
about
to
launch
into
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
correct
characterization
of
iowa's
apportionment
method,
but
i
can
tell
you
for
certain
that
iowa's
apportionment
method
is
not
challenged
in
this
case.
what,
the
only
issue,
all
of
the
issues
have
been
excluded
except
one,
facial
discrimination--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--so
we
focused
on
that.
but
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
iowa
would
include,
uses
the
single
factor
test,
at
least
they
did
the
last
time
it
came
before
this
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
and
that
that
factor
would
look
to
the
sales
of
the
corporation
whose
earnings
were
being
allocated,
which
would
be
the
parent
in
this
situation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
it
doesn't
look
to
sales
of
the
domestic
subsidiary
when
it's
allocating
a
parent's
income.
what
this
case
really
is
about
is
not
discrimination
against
a
foreign
subsidiary.
the
claim
is
that
a
corporation
in
the
united
states
is
being
discriminated
against
if
it
uses
a
foreign
subsidiary
to
conduct
foreign
commerce.
and
what
our
argument
demonstrates,
we
believe,
is
that
the
corporation
that
uses
the
foreign
subsidiary
to
conduct
its
foreign
commerce
actually
has
less
of
its
income
exposed
to
state
taxation
than
if
it
used
any
other
method
of
organization.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
and
that
leaves
open
the
question
that
i
need
to
address,
which
is
kraft's
argument
now
is
that
even
though
they
may
have
less
of
their
income
subject
to
a
state
tax,
they
want
to
complain
about
the
fact
that
they
may
have
a
higher
national
level
tax
when
they
use
a
foreign
subsidiary.
this
is
because
the
foreign
government
may
choose
to
tax
both
the
earnings
of
the
foreign
subsidiary
and
the
dividends
as
those
dividends
are
distributed
to
a
united
states
corporation.
what
we
showed
in
our
brief
is
that
exactly
the
same
result
applies
to
a
similarly
situated
domestic
corporation.
that
is
to
say
under
the
internal
revenue
code
the
united
states
taxes
both
the
earnings
of
a
domestic
corporation
and
it
taxes
the
dividends
of
a
domestic
corporation
when
they
are
distributed
abroad,
when
they
are
distributed
to
a
foreign
corporation.
the
result
is
thus
precisely
parallel
treatment
of
foreign
and
domestic
commerce,
not
discrimination.
now
this
isn't
the
first
time
this
subject
has
come
before
the
court.
in
fact
this
same
argument
of
multiple
burdens
on
international
distributions
of
dividends
has
been
twice
considered
by
this
court
and
twice
rejected,
in
container
corp.
and
in
the
mobil
case.
and
in
fact
as
recently
as--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
mobil.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
mobil
v.
vermont.
as
recently
as
page
10
of
their
opening
brief
in
this
court,
kraft
acknowledged
that
they
were
not
complaining
about
multiple
burdens.
they
only
raised
it
in
their
reply
brief
for
the
first
time.
in
container
corporation
what
this
court
held
was
that
the
risk
of
additional
burdens
at
the
national
level
is
mitigated
by
the
credits
allowed
under
the
internal
revenue
code
for
foreign
taxes.
the
court
also
held,
as
counsel
has
acknowledged,
that
there
was
no
constitutional
requirement
for
the
states
to
provide
similar
credits.
as
the
court
held
in
the
mobil
case,
concurrent
taxation
by
the
state
and
federal
governments
of
income
received
in
the
united
states
is
a,
quote,
well
established
norm.
when
the
federal
government
allows
a
credit
for
the
foreign
taxes
that
are
paid
the
result
is
that
the
state
and
the
foreign
government,
rather
than
the
state
and
the
united
states,
stand
as
the
concurrent
taxing
authorities
for
this
particular
kind
of
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i,
whether...
in
a
facial
challenge
one
might
quibble
about
whether
it
is
necessarily
foreign
commerce,
because
foreign
subsidiaries
can
earn
their
money
in
the
united
states.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
the...
we
acknowledge
that
in
the
worst
case,
which
is
the
way
we
attempt
to
address
this
question
of
discrimination,
the
worst
case,
or
the
best
case,
if
you
will,
for
kraft,
where
all
of
the
earnings
are
derived
abroad,
we're
talking
about
foreign
commerce.
our
point
is
that
the
state
scheme
actually
imposes
a
lesser
burden
on
this
method
of
conducting
that
commerce
than
if
it
were
conducted
by
means
of
either
a
domestic
subsidiary
or
by
the
parent.
kraft
faults
us
for
suggesting
that
they
could
use
a
domestic
subsidiary
to
conduct
this
commerce.
of
course
that
would
put
the
case
on
a
face-to-face
comparison.
our
point
was
not
that
kraft
would
pay
less
state
taxes
if
it
conducted
the
foreign
commerce
with
a
domestic
subsidiary.
our
point
was
that
it
would
not
pay
less,
that
it
would
not
attain
any
advantage
by
using
a
domestic
rather
than
a
foreign
corporation...
yes,
using
a
domestic
rather
than
a
foreign
to
conduct
its
foreign
commerce.
so
neither...
the
synopsis
of
it
is
that
the
state
does
not
discriminate
either
against
foreign
commerce,
because
it
tends
to
tax
less
of
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
i
understood
your
hypothetical,
you're
saying
there's
a
domestic
corporation
not
in
iowa
that
receives
its
only
income--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
that
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
it
still
applies.
in
that
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
sure
i
can
answer
that
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
it,
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
it
is
not
discriminatory
because
iowa
would
tax
less
of
the
income
derived...
iowa
only
taxes
the
portion
of
the
foreign
earnings
that
are
distributed
as
dividends.
so
it,
when
the
corporation
receives
the
dividends
iowa
is
taxing
only
that
portion.
it
could
be
$1,
it
could
be
1
percent,
or
it
could
be
100
percent
of
the
after
tax
earnings
abroad.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
doesn't
need
to,
because
if
a
domestic
corporation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
white,
if
a
domestic
corporation
did
exactly
the
same
commerce
iowa
would
tax
the
entire
foreign
earnings
of
that
corporation,
rather
than
only
the
portion
distributed
as
dividends.
it
taxes
more.
and
that's
why,
having
taxed
the
full
income
of
the
domestic
subsidiary,
it
allows
a
deduction.
it
only
assesses
a
one
state
level
tax.
when
the
dividends
come
in
it
hasn't
taxed
those
dividends,
and
so
it
needs
to
tax
them.
it
only
takes
the
one
bite.
it
takes
them
either
against
the
full
earnings
by
a
domestic
subsidiary
or
against
the
distributed
earnings
from
a
foreign
subsidiary.
that's
not
discrimination.
if
it
is,
it
benefits
the
foreign
subsidiaries.
