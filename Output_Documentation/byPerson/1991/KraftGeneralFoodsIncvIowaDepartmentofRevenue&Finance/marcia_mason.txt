ms.
marcia
mason
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
iowa
corporate
income
tax
does
not
discriminate
against
foreign
commerce.
kraft
includes
foreign
dividends
in
its
iowa
apportionable
tax
base
because
of
the
way
it
chooses
to
structure
its
business,
and
not
because
it
engages
in
foreign
commerce.
obviously
some
methods
or
structures
of
operating
will
be
more
profitable
than
other
methods,
but
kraft's
conclusion
that
the
use
of
foreign
subsidiaries
is
integral
to
doing
foreign
commerce
is
based
on
lots
of
factors
unrelated
to
taxes
and
which
may
vary
depending
on
the
type
of
business
you
look
at
and
the
particular
foreign
country
in
which
they
do
business.
the
parties
stipulated
that
multinational
corporations
typically
do
foreign
commerce
through
foreign
subsidiaries
for
various
reasons,
and
the
non-exclusive
reasons
listed
included
the
better
ability
to
limit
their
liability
in
the
foreign
country,
the
marketing
advantages
of
being
perceived
as
being
a
local
company,
a
greater
ease
in
borrowing
of
money
in
that
country,
and
so
forth.
the
parties
did
not
stipulate
that
all
foreign
countries
require
that
in
order
to
do
commerce
in
those
countries
you
use
a
foreign
subsidiary.
that
was
not
stipulated
to.
ms.
marcia
mason
i
don't
believe
the
state
of
iowa
has
ever
argued
that
that
is
not
part
of
commerce.
what
the
state
of
iowa
is
arguing
is
that
kraft
can
do
the
same
thing
that
it
does,
can
do
foreign
commerce,
can
do
business
in
these
foreign
countries
through
domestically
incorporated
subsidiaries,
subsidiaries
incorporated
somewhere
in
the
united
states.
ms.
marcia
mason
well,
there
obviously
is
a
differential
treatment
between
domestic
and
foreign
dividends.
that's,
that
just
goes
without--
ms.
marcia
mason
--no,
we
don't
believe
that
that
follows.
ms.
marcia
mason
because
we
believe
that
it's
not
proper
to
focus
solely
on
the
internal
revenue
code
and
therefore
the
iowa
treatment
of
dividends
without
looking
beyond
dividends
to
the
income
of
the
entire
unitary
business
that
is
being
taxed.
and
if
you
look
at
the
entire
tax
structure,
the
iowa
income
tax,
and
we're
not
looking
at
two
different
taxes
here,
it's
all
the
iowa
income
tax,
the,
there
is
a
reason
to
treat
them
differently.
and
that
reason
is
the
same
reason
the
internal
revenue
code
has,
which
is
how
the
underlying
earnings
from
which
the
dividends
are
paid
get
treated.
the
foreign
earnings,
as
you
pointed
out
previously,
do
not
all
get
taxed.
a
lot
of
times
foreign
earnings
are
reinvested
in
the
foreign
country
and
used
to
expand
operations
there.
the
only
time
the
foreign
earnings
get
taxed
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
therefore
also
by
iowa,
is
if
they
are
returned
to
the
u.s.
shareholder
in
the
form
of
dividends,
and
then
it's
only
that
amount
that
gets
returned
as
dividends
that
is
taxed.
but
with
the
domestic
subsidiary,
whether
it's
doing
business
in
the
united
states
or
doing
business
abroad,
all
of
its
earnings
will
be
taxed
by
the
united
states
and
an
apportioned
share
will
be
taxed
in
the
states
in
which
it
does
business.
so
we
believe
it's
not
proper
to
focus
only
on
how
the
dividends
are
treated.
obviously
if
that's
done
iowa
can't
win,
because
it's
just
obvious
that
we
are
treating
domestic
dividends
differently
from
foreign
subsidiary
dividends
paid
out
of
foreign
earnings.
we
don't--
ms.
marcia
mason
--well,
kraft
has
stipulated
that
these
dividends
are
paid
by
unitary,
that
it's
part
of
their
unitary
income,
that
they
are
paid
by
unitary
payors.
so
we...
and
they
are
100
percent
owned
subsidiaries.
they
are
in
effect
really
merely
an
extension
of
kraft's
own
business
that
it
could
have
done
through
a
separate
division
of
its
business
rather
than
through
a
separate
corporation.
so
we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
burden
on
the
unitary
business
as
a
whole,
that
that
is
proper
to
do.
because
kraft
is
arguing
that
iowa
is
somehow
discouraging
investing
in
foreign
subsidiaries
and
pushing
them
somehow
to
invest
in
domestic
subsidiaries
instead,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
burden
of
the
overall
unitary
business
you
can
see
that
that's
not
what
iowa
is
doing.
it's
not
encouraging
doing
business
within
the
united
states
through
domestic
subsidiaries
rather
than
doing
foreign
commerce
or
even
doing
foreign
commerce
through
foreign
subsidiaries.
the
point
was
mentioned
earlier
about
the
holding
company
and
why
that
wouldn't
work,
and
we
believe
that
it
would
work.
companies
are
doing
it,
and
in
1980
the
coopers
and
lybrand
accounting
firm
was
advising
corporations
to
do
that
as
a
way
to
cope
with
this
court's
mobil
oil
decision.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
fact
that
would
show
that
it
would
be
somehow
burdensome
to
set
up
a
domestic
holding
company.
ms.
marcia
mason
we
believe
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
was
correct.
ms.
marcia
mason
i
believe
the
iowa
supreme
court
was
correct
because
the
iowa
income
tax
has,
there's
nothing,
there's
no
local
in-state
bias
about
it.
it
treats
all
companies
subject
to
the
iowa
income
tax
the
same.
ms.
marcia
mason
of
course
in
this
particular
case
the
specific
issue
of
whether
a
lack
of
a
benefit
to
local
commercial
interest
is
alone
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
discrimination
problem
does
not
really
have
to
be
decided
because
iowa's
position
is
that
this
is
not
discriminating
against
foreign
commerce
in
favor
of
either
doing
iowa
business
or
doing
business
within
the
united
states
through
a
domestic
subsidiary.
but
going--
ms.
marcia
mason
--correct.
the
iowa
supreme
court
looked
at
the
fact
that
all
companies
that
pay
iowa
income
tax
pay
tax
on,
include
foreign
dividends
in
their
tax
base.
that
includes
iowa
companies
which
also
receive
foreign
dividends
and
will
be
affected
by
this
statute.
ms.
marcia
mason
i
don't
believe
that
iowa
is
arguing
a
completely
new
standard.
iowa
did
argue--
ms.
marcia
mason
--iowa
did
argue
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
that
if
you
look
at
the
overall
burden
of
the
unitary
business--
ms.
marcia
mason
--well,
certainly
this
court
could,
if
it
wanted
to,
could
remand
this
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
have
them
decide
it
under
what
this
court
says
is
the
proper
standard.
this
is,
however,
a
facial
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
so
this
court
could
also
very
easily
go
ahead
and
decide
the
constitutionality
question
at
this
level
rather
than
remanding
it.
there's
no
additional
findings
of
fact
that
need
to
be
made,
and
so
forth,
because
it
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
the...
as
i
was
saying
about
the
fact
that
kraft
could
structure
its
business
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
having
foreign
dividends
included
in
the
tax
base,
in
the
amerada
hess
case
where
oil
companies
had
claimed
that
a
denial
of
a
deduction
for
the
windfall
profits
tax
discriminated
against
oil
producers
who
also
marketed
their
oil,
in
other
words
integrated
oil
companies,
in
favor
of
independent
retailers
who
did
not
produce
their
oil
but
who
could
effectively
deduct
an
equivalent
to
the
windfall
profits
tax
as
part
of
their
cost
of
goods
sold.
in
that
case
operating
an
integrated
oil
company
may
have
been
more
efficient
and
profitable
than
using
separate
corporations,
as
kraft
argues
that
using
foreign
subsidiaries
is
the
more
profitable
way
of
doing
foreign
commerce.
but
the
court
stated
that
whatever
different
effect
the
statute
had
on
the
two
groups
was
based
solely
from
differences
between
the
nature
of
their
businesses
and
not
from
the
location
of
their
activity.
and
that
is
definitely
true
in
this
case.
two
subsidiaries
could
both
be
doing
business
in
the
same
geographical
location
and
the
dividends
from
a
domestic
subsidiary
doing
business
in
the
foreign
country
would
be
deductible.
the
commerce
clause
protects
the
marketplace.
it
does
not
protect
the
particular
structure
or
method
of
operating
in
that
market.
and
the
anti-discrimination
requirement
promotes
equal
treatment
of
foreign
commerce,
but
not
identical
treatment
of
all
taxpayers
that
are
engaged
in
such
commerce.
if
the
foreign
government
requires
the
use
of
foreign
subsidiaries,
then
obviously
it's
that
foreign
government
and
not
iowa
which
is
placing
some
restriction
on
the
doing
of
foreign
commerce.
and
indeed
kraft
could
have
set
up
a
domestic
holding
company
to
receive
the
foreign
income,
and
then
would
pass
that
income
on
to
the
parent
company,
kraft,
in
the
form
of
what
would
be
deductible
domestic
dividends.
kraft
argues
that
if
we
look
at
what
happens
if
all
states
apply
the
same
tax
scheme
as
iowa,
then
those
foreign
dividends
will
still
be
taxed
by
some
state,
and
that
is
true.
but
what
kraft
does
not
point
out
is
that
if
all
states
applied
iowa's
tax
scheme,
then
the
earnings
of
domestic
subsidiaries,
regardless
of
what
state
the
domestic
subsidiary
does
business
in,
will
be
taxed
as
well
by
the
states.
and
the
earnings
of
a
domestic
subsidiary
are
likely
to
be
greater
than
dividends
from
a
foreign
subsidiary,
assuming
equal
earnings,
because
the
foreign
subsidiary
is
not
likely
to
pay
out
all
of
its
earnings
in
the
form
of
dividends.
we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
entire
unitary
business,
and
we
believe
that
is
proper
to
do,
that
the
subsidiaries
are
really
an
extension
of
kraft's
own
business
and
you
look
at
how
the
iowa
corporate
income
tax
taxes
that
unitary
business,
that
the
state
tax
burden
on
a
unitary
business
that
operates
through
domestic
subsidiaries
will
likely
actually
be
greater
than
the
state
tax
burden
on
a
unitary
business
that
does
foreign
commerce
through
foreign
subsidiaries.
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute,
as
i
mentioned,
and
therefore
kraft
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
burden
is
that
it
must
establish
that
there
is
no
set
of
circumstances
which
exist
under
which
the
statute
would
be
valid.
and
the
fact
that
a
statute
might
operate
unconstitutionally
under
some
specified
set
of
circumstances
is
insufficient
to
make
the
statute
invalid
on
its
face.
and
kraft
cannot
show
that
this
statute
discourages
or
burdens
foreign
commerce
or
even
doing
foreign
commerce
through
foreign
subsidiaries.
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
issue,
kraft
characterizes
the
state's
interest
as
being
administrative
convenience.
iowa
sees
it
more
as
being
a
necessity,
as
being
quite
essential
that
we
be
able
to
piggy-back
onto
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
not
just
being
merely
convenient
for
the
state.
the--
ms.
marcia
mason
--i'm
not
sure
if
that's
really
in
the
record.
my
impression
is
that
it's
doing
business
within
that
country.
ms.
marcia
mason
no,
it's
definitely
not
would
be
our
position.
the
commerce
clause
is
part
of
the
u.s.
constitution
to
protect
the
states
basically
from
each
other
and
not
to
protect
france
and
germany.
ms.
marcia
mason
well,
since
they're
challenging
the
statute
on
its
face,
i
guess
it
doesn't
really
matter
now.
i
mean,
hypotheticals,
you
could
probably
find
a
hypothetical
where
a
company
doing
foreign
commerce
through
foreign
subsidiaries
will
pay
more
tax
than
a
company
that
does
foreign
commerce
through
domestic
subsidiaries
or
that
does
u.s.
commerce.
but
as
i
mentioned
before
in
talking
about
the
burden
of
proof,
the
fact
that
you
can
come
up
with
those
circumstances
doesn't
show
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
ms.
marcia
mason
right.
with
regard
again--
ms.
marcia
mason
--we've
never
argued
that
it's
not.
it
seemed
like
in
the
mobil
oil
case,
which
discussed
dividends
and
whether
dividends
from
foreign
unitary
subsidiaries
could
be
included
in
the
tax
base,
appeared
to
assume
that
it
is
part
of
commerce.
ms.
marcia
mason
well,
you'd
have
to
look
at
what
happens
to
the
underlying
earnings.
we
believe
there
are
cases--
ms.
marcia
mason
--we're
not
basing
it
on...
i
was
not
basing
it
on
where
it
comes
from.
as
i
said,
a
domestic
subsidiary
could
be
sending
dividends
from
a
foreign
country
and
it
would
be
coming
across
national
lines,
but
that
would
be
deductible.
ms.
marcia
mason
yes.
ms.
marcia
mason
that
may
be
foreign
commerce,
but
the
point
that
the
state
of
iowa
is
making
is
that
so
also
is
then
the
dividends
that
are
coming
over
from
domestic
subsidiaries,
and
those
dividends
coming
over
from
domestic
subsidiaries
are
deductible.
ms.
marcia
mason
i
believe
in
that
case
that
it
probably
would.
there
your
underlying
earnings,
you
don't
really
have
a
justification
for
treating
that,
you
don't
have
a
rational
basis
or
any
other
real
justification
for
treating
that
differently
based
on
how
the
underlying
earnings
from
which
those
dividends
were
paid
are
being-taxed.
ms.
marcia
mason
i
think,
if
i
understand
you,
you're
asking
if
we
would
allow
like
a
combined--
ms.
marcia
mason
--report.
ms.
marcia
mason
and
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
ms.
marcia
mason
iowa
is
not
a
combined
reporting
state.
we're
single
entity
and
we
include,
we
tax
the
income
of
kraft,
which
is
business
income,
but
we
don't
look
at
all
of
the
earnings
of
all
subsidiaries
that
are
unitary
with
kraft.
addressing
briefly
now
the
necessity
of
coupling
with
the
internal
revenue
code.
if
we
decoupled,
even
to
the
extent
of
just
excluding
foreign
dividends,
the
burden
to
the
state
of
iowa
is
much
greater
than
simply
changing
a
tax
form
and
adding
one
additional
line
to
that.
corporate
distributions
is
a
very
complex
area
of
the
law
of
accounting.
corporate
accounting,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
don't
really
understand
it
that
well
because
it
is
complex,
and
in
looking
at
the
bittker
and
eustice
book
on
corporate
income
taxation,
the
one
word
that
comes
up
over
and
over
again
is
the
word
complex.
the
state
of
iowa
would
have
to
develop
the
expertise
in
the
audit
staff
to
first
of
all
figure
out
if
the
corporate
distribution
even
is
a
dividend
or
if
it's
really
something
else
that
should
be
in
the
taxable
base,
and
that's
something
that
the
irs
may
or
may
not
concern
itself
with.
because
under
the
internal
revenue
code
it
would
be
taxable
anyway,
whether
it
is
characterized
by
the
company
as
a
dividend
or
characterized
as
some
other
taxable
item
of
income.
so
the
department
would
have
to
do
that.
it
would
also
have
to
be
able
to
verify
the
proper
amount,
and
since
iowa
has
a
net
income
tax,
iowa
would
have
to
be
able
to
figure
out
what
expenses
of
the
company
were
attributable
to
receiving
those
foreign
dividends.
i
see
my
time
has
run
out.
ms.
marcia
mason
thank
you.
