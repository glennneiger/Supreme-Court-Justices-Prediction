mr.
libin,
a
minute
ago
you
said
you
can't
tax
dividends
from
foreign
commerce
versus
dividends
from
domestic
commerce,
but
that's
one...
it
isn't
necessarily
dividends
from
foreign
commerce.
it
could
be
a
foreign
subsidiary
that
does
business
in
the
united
states,
just
as
in
other
cases
it
could
be
a
domestic
subsidiary
that
does
foreign
commerce
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if,
what
if
a
domestic
corporation
does
foreign
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
wish
to
understand
this,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
you
had
the
option
under
the
federal
income
tax
law
to
deduct,
to
elect
a
deduction
of
these
dividends,
and
if
you
had
exercised
that
option
you
would
have
had
the
same
deduction
under
iowa
law,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
the
same
both
for
federal
and
iowa
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
follow.
if
you
elect
the
deduction
route--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
you
deduct
the
same
amount
or
a
greater
amount
or
a
lesser
amount
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
can
deduct--
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
overall--
--but
that's
not
a
credit,
you
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
think
we
won't
notice
them?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
opponent's
point
is
you're
not
taxing
the
foreign
subsidiary,
you're
taxing,
you're
taxing
the
parent.
and
what
is
the
fact
that
some
different
entity
is
treated
differently
for
some
other
purpose,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
your
taxation
of
the
parent?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
concede
that
the
payment
of
the
dividend
at
least
is
foreign
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
it
would
be
discrimination
against
foreign
commerce
if
you
taxed
only
dividends
paid
by
foreign
subsidiaries
and
no
dividends
paid
by
domestic
subsidiaries?
surely
that
would
be
a
discrimination
against
foreign
commerce,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
happens
to
the
underlying
earnings.
indeed,
i
don't
care
if
the
foreign
subsidiary
makes
all
its
earnings
domestically.
it's
a
foreign
subsidiary
and
the
money
comes
from
england
to
the
united
states,
and
you
tax
that
and
you
don't
tax
any
other
dividends.
wouldn't
that
be
discrimination
against
foreign
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
all
the
dividends
here
at
issue
are
coming
from
abroad.
aren't
there
transfers
from
abroad?
the
money
is
coming
into
this
country
from
abroad?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
foreign
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
strange.
