justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify,
you
may
have
already
covered
this
and
i
may
not
have
fully
followed
the
argument
at
one
point,
but
i
think
your
opponents
contend
that
the
discrimination
actually
favors
the
foreign
subsidiaries
because
they're
only
taxing
the
dividends
from
the
foreign
whereas
they
tax
the
entire
stream
of
income
from
the
domestic
subsidiary.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
were
not
true
would
they
be
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
was
hoping
i'd
get
an
answer
that
didn't
depend
on
my
thinking
through
another
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
in
this
case
that
they
are
wrong
in
saying
that
the
foreign
subsidiary,
the
dividends
from
the
foreign
subsidiary
impose
a
lesser
burden,
taxing
that
impose
a
lesser
burden
than
taxing
the
entire
stream
of
income
from
a
domestic
subsidiary?
and
your
answer,
i
think,
is
well,
they're
subjected
to
a
tax
by
the
foreign
government.
now,
apart
from
that
is
there
another
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
permissible
for
iowa,
i
know
they
don't
have
the
three
factor
formula
there,
i
guess
they
only
have
two
factor,
but
say
it
was
a
three
factor
state,
it's
easier
to
think
about.
supposing
that
instead
of
taxing
the
dividends
they
took
the,
they
treated
the
unitary
business
as
including
the
entire
income
of
the
foreign
subsidiary
and
then
added
to
the
base
the
property,
wages,
and
whatever
the
three
factors
are,
in
the
foreign
subsidiary.
would
that
be
permissible
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
convenience
for
whom...
i'm
sorry,
chief.
go
ahead.
convenience
for
whom?
for
the
taxpayer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
saving
you
the
trouble
of
filling
out
forms,
these
small
companies
with
foreign
subsidiaries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
haven't
we
said
in
some
cases
that,
we
have
said
administrative
convenience
doesn't
justify
discrimination
where
the
scrutiny,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
that
is
other
than
rational
basis,
if
it's
all
heightened?
i
thought
some
of
our
cases
had
said
administrative
convenience
will
justify
discrimination
when
it's
just
a
question
of
rational
basis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
factual
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
just...
recalling
the
dialogue
with
justice
white
by
your
opponent,
what
about
the
suggestion
that
the
very
transaction,
the
dividend
transaction
itself
is
in
foreign
commerce,
the
payment
by
a
foreign
subsidiary
to
a
domestic
parent?
isn't
that
a
transaction
in
foreign
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that's
responsive
to,
if
i
understood
justice
white's
question
at
any
rate,
of
the
concern
that
the
flow
of
money
across
national
boundaries
in
these
dividends
is
taxed
differently
than
a
similar
flow
of
money
within
the
united
states,
and
therefore
there's
a
discrimination,
at
least
a
differential
treatment
between
domestic
and
foreign.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
ergo
between
domestic
and
foreign
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
dividend
is
itself
a
transaction
in
commerce,
why
is
that
not
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
within
the
country.
is
it
your
view
that
transactions,
business
transactions
between
corporations,
or
whatever
they
might
be
in
france
and
germany,
with
one
another
are
foreign
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
and
the
record
doesn't
really
tell
us,
then,
whether
these
companies
are
engaged
in
foreign
commerce
or
not,
if
you've
answered
my
first
question
correctly.
i
wonder
if
we
have
a
hypothetical
case
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
that
may
be
in
the
papers
and
i
just
don't
know
it.
under
your
statute
would
this
company
have
had
the
option
if
it
chose
to,
instead
of
having
its
foreign
dividends
taxed,
to
have
included
its
foreign
earnings
and
the
foreign
sales
into
the
basic
factor
for
the
entire
business?
do
you
understand
what
i'm
trying
to
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
you
do,
when
you
say
it's
less
inclusive,
it's
less
inclusive
in
terms
of
computing
the
gross
income.
but
is
it
also
different
in
that
with
respect
to
your
domestic
subsidiaries
you
include
their
sales
and
the
other
half
of
the
formula,
which
you
don't
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
sales.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
look
to
sales
in
the
foreign
subsidiary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
what
is
the
significance
of
being
a
unitary
business
in
iowa
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
does
not
include
the
earnings
of
the
kentucky
subsidiary
in
the
total
earnings
subject
to
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
petitioner
operates
a
unitary
business
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
several
foreign
countries.
because
part
of
that
business
is
conducted
in
iowa,
kraft
is
subject
to
the
iowa
business
tax
on
corporations.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
iowa's
inclusion
in
the
tax
base
of
the
dividends
that
kraft
received
from
six
subsidiaries,
each
of
which
was
incorporated
and
conducted
its
business
in
a
foreign
country.
while
iowa
taxes
the
dividends
that
a
corporation
receives
from
its
foreign
subsidiaries,
iowa
does
not
tax
dividends
received
from
domestic
subsidiaries.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
disparate
treatment
of
dividends
from
foreign
and
domestic
subsidiaries
violates
the
foreign
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
the
iowa
statute
facially
discriminates
against
foreign
commerce
and
therefore,
is
unconstitutional.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
