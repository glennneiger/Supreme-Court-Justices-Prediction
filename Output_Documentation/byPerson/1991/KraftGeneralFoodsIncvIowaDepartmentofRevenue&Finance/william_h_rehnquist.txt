chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1918,
kraft
general
foods
v.
iowa
department
of
revenue
and
finance.
mr.
libin,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--overall,
mr.
libin,
your
foreign
subsidiary
isn't
treated
any
worse
than
a
domestic
corporation
in
iowa,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
it's
the
domestic...
i'm
talking,
not
talking
about
a
domestic,
how
about
just
an...
okay,
a
domestic
subsidiary.
it's
income
is
taxed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
don't
necessarily
weigh
these
things,
put
them
into
numerous
sub-classes
and
sub-compartments.
the
basic
question
is
does
this
favor
iowa
corporations
over
foreign
corporations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
apply
my
test,
which
you
may
be
right,
maybe
it's
not
the
right
one,
but
generally
it
doesn't
favor
foreign
corporations
over
iowa
corporations,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
all
tax
laws
pressure
you
to
operate
one
way
or
another?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
case
of
ours
is
it
that
you
think
says
that
if
a
tax
law
tends
to
push
you
one
way
or
another
it
violates
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
case
is
still
good
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
basic
decision
of
a
state
to
levy
a
tax
at
all
certainly
pushes
the
corporation
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--that
assumes
the
point
at
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
libin.
ms.
mason,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
ordinarily
decide
hypothetical
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
libin,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
libin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1918,
kraft
general
foods
versus
iowa
department
of
revenue
and
finance
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
