--so
in
one
sense,
then,
for
some
taxpayers
at
least,
there
is
no
discrimination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
argue
that
the
foreign
dividends
are
really
different
in
kind,
they're
qualitatively
different
because
the
underlying
income
from
which
they
are
derived
is
not
taxed
by
the
federal
or
the
state
government,
and
that
gives
this
a
unique
character
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
recognize?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
just
another
way
of
saying
that
there
is
discrimination
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
think
you
denigrate
the
state's
convenience
argument
somewhat.
i
take
it
they
have,
your
state,
or
the
state
of
iowa
has
no
capacity
to
do
foreign
audits.
they
don't
have,
they're
not
like
the
california
franchise
tax
board
with
auditors
overseas
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
this
convenience
element
is
very,
very
important
for
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
they
say
that
adopting
the
federal
scheme
is
a
very
important
administrative
convenience.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
they're
enabled
to
tax
what
they're
constitutionally
entitled
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
federal
purposes,
i
take
it
it's,
that
a
wholly-owned
domestic
subsidiary
of
kraft
includes,
all
that
income
is
included
on
the
federal
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
kraft
tax
an
apportioned
part
of
that
amount
to
the
extend
that
there's
a
unitary
business?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
it's
a
unitary
business
the
subsidiary--
