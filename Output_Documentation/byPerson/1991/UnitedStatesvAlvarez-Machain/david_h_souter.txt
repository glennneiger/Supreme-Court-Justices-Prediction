so
it
would
be...
it
would
be
correct
to
say
that
in
no
presently
operative
extradition
treaty
of
the
united
states
there
is
any
express
bar
to
the
united
states'
resort
to
some
means
other
than
extradition
to
get
the
person
back.
justice

okay.
is
it...
may
i
ask
you
another
treaty
question?
your
brief
on
page

refers
both
the
u.n.
charter
and
to
the
oas
charter,
which
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to.
did...
did
this
abduction
violate
the
terms
of
either
of
those
charters?
