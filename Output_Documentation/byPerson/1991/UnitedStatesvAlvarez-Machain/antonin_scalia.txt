justice
scalia
general
starr,
is
it
any
less
a
violation
of
international
law
to
kidnap
a
foreign
national
from
a
foreign
country
than
an
american
national
from
a
foreign
country?
justice
scalia
can
i
assume
that
we
are
not
supposed
to
go
in
and
just
snatch
people
from
foreign
countries
without
their
consent?
justice
scalia
that
isn't
the
point
i
am
making.
whether
it
is
a
violation--
justice
scalia
--of
mexico's
sovereignty
depends
upon
whether
the
person
snatched
was
a
mexican
citizen
or
not.
justice
scalia
and
indeed,
an
american
national
might
have
more
cause
to
complain
about
the
violation
of
international
law
by
his
country
than
a
mexican
national
might.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
specific
arrangment...
what
article
9
said
if
you
don't
turn
it
over
you
may
consider
prosecution.
justice
scalia
it
does
not
go
on
to
say
and
nothing
else.
it
is
a
treaty
that
gives
to
the
united
states
benefits
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
before.
you
can
get
extradition,
and
if
you
don't
get
that
you
might
also
get
prosecution,
and
it
doesn't
go
on
to
say
and
that's
it.
justice
scalia
--nothing
about
the
point--
justice
scalia
--the
rule
in
rauscher,
i
mean
the
rule
you
suggest
may
be
a
reasonable
one,
but
it
wasn't
the
rule
that
was
pronounced
in
rauscher.
rauscher
said
and
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
miller,
we
feel
authorized
to
state
that
the
weight
of
authority
and
of
sound
principle
are
in
favor
of
the
proposition
that
a
person
who
has
been
brought
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
by
virtue
of
proceedings
under
an
extradition
treaty
can
only
be
tried
for
one
of
the
offenses
described
in
that
treaty.
that
is
a
quite
different
principle.
if
you
are
using
the
treaty
to
get
him
here,
you
have
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
here,
the
treaty
is
not
used
to
get
him
here.
i
don't,
i
mean,
there
may
be
good
reasons,
but
rauscher
isn't
the
reason.
justice
scalia
what...
you're
referring
to
the
limitations
in
the
expedition
treaty,
and
you
referred
earlier
to
the
limitations
in
article
9.
there
are
no
limitations
in
article
9.
you
can
read
it
from
beginning
to
end.
there
is
no
limitation.
justice
scalia
you
create
the
limitation
by
simply
positing
that
it
can't
be
done
any
other
way.
it
does
not
say
in
article
9
or
anywhere
else
in
the
treaty--
justice
scalia
--that
it
can't
be
done
in
any
other
way.
justice
scalia
but
there's
no
prohibition
of
any
other
manner
of
getting
the
individual
back
to
the
united
states
except
to
the
extent
that
some
such
prohibition
exists
in
international
law,
quite
apart
from
the
treaty.
justice
scalia
would
it
be
any
less
shocking
to
them
if
they
had
no
extradition
treaty
with
the
united
states
and
the
same
thing
occurred?
justice
scalia
of
course,
it
would
be
no
less
shocking
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
relying
on
the
treaty.
you're
relying
upon
a
general
rule
of
international
law.
justice
scalia
the
clear
intent.
certainly
not
the
clear
language.
justice
scalia
that's
no
bargain.
all
it
says
is
that
mexico
may
prosecute.
that's
what
the
treaty
says,
not
that
it
must.
justice
scalia
you
mean
they
say
may
when
they
mean
must?
justice
scalia
are
you
telling
me
that
article
9
means
that
mexico
must
prosecute--
justice
scalia
--if
there
is
evidence
to
prosecute?
justice
scalia
does
it
mean
mexico
can
prosecute
if
it
feels
like
it,
and
if
it
doesn't
feel
like
it
it
need
not
prosecute?
justice
scalia
general
starr,
do
you
agree
that
mexico
had
an
obligation
to
prosecute
under
article
9--
justice
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
there's
a
good
faith
obligation
to
prosecute
if
they
thought
the
evidence
warranted
it?
the
united
states
doesn't
think
that's
what
this
treaty
means?
