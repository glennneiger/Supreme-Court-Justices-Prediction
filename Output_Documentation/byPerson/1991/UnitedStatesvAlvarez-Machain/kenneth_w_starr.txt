mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
100
years
this
court
has
steadfastly
adhered
to
what
has
become
known
as
the
ker-frisbie
doctrine.
under
that
doctrine,
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
is
not
impaired
by
the
fact
that
an
individual
was
unlawfully
brought
before
the
court
to
stand
trial.
that
doctrine
has
served
as
the
backdrop
for
the
executive
branch's
negotiation
of
numerous
extradition
treaties,
including
our
treaty
with
mexico.
this
case,
involving
the
forcible
abduction
of
an
individual
from
mexico
to
stand
trial
in
this
country
in
connection
with
the
torture
and
death
of
special
agent
enrique
camarena
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
brings
this
doctrine
once
again
before
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
lower
courts
concluded
that
the
ker-frisbie
doctrine
does
not
apply
where
there
is
an
extradition
treaty
in
effect,
the
extradition
treaty
was
arguably
violated
by
the
abduction,
and
where
the
foreign
government
protests
the
abduction.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
legal
advisor
is
not
on
the
brief,
but
the
brief
expresses
the
views
of
the
united
states,
which
includes
the
department
of
state,
and
justice
blackmun,
there
should
be
no
significance
to
the
fact
that
they
are
not
shown
on
the
brief.
their
legal
advisor,
mr.
williamson
has
in
fact
opined
that
in
his
view
it
is
entirely
appropriate
and
proper
for
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
under
circumstances
such
as
these.
the
government
speaks
with
one
voice
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
he
did
provide--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--a
letter
or
an
opinion,
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
a
customary
way,
justice
blackmun,
in
which
the
legal
advisor
expresses
his
views.
in
our
view
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
by
a
national
of
that
country,
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
facts
are
different,
yes,
but
i
think
the
doctrine
itself,
justice
stevens,
speaks
quite
broadly
to
the
courts,
that
it
is
the
role
of
the
courts
to
try
cases,
and
not
to
involve
themselves
with
how
the
individual
came
into
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
because
under
that...
that
is
exactly
right,
and
i
think
that
gets
to
the
core
of
this
case.
the
distinction
between
ker
on
the
one
hand
and
rauscher
on
the
other.
justice
miller's
opinion
in
the
rauscher
case
examined
very
carefully
the
background
of
the
treaty,
the
webster-ashburton
treaty--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
facts
here
are
different,
but
the
point
remains,
justice
stevens,
that
the
doctrine
itself
has
been
the
broad
doctrine
that
one
simply
does
not
inquire
into
how...
the
court
does
not
inquire
into
how
the
individual
came
there
unless,
and
this
is
rauscher's
point,
there
is
a
violation
of
a
treaty.
a
treaty
is
law.
it
must
be
respected
as
law,
but
here
it
is
uncontested
that
there
is
no
express
provision
of
the
treaty
that
speaks
to
this--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--depending
on
the
precise
terms
of
the
treaty,
i
don't
want
to
speak
so
broadly
as
to
say
any
violation
might
give
rise
to
a
divesting
of
jurisdiction.
but
certainly
if
we
had
a
situation
where,
as
in
the
rauscher
case,
there
is
a
clear
treaty
provision,
the
doctrine
of
specialty,
well-understood,
discussed
at
great
length
indeed.
that
doctrine
finds
its
way
into
the
text
of
our
treaty
with
mexico.
it
is
quite
well-settled
that
if
a
state
is
going
to
perform
an
official
act
and
render
a
fugitive
over,
then
that
state
has
an
interest
in
that
individual
only
be
charged
with
a
crime
that
has
been
laid
at
his
feet.
but
note
that
in
rauscher,
the
only
relief
for
rauscher
in
contrast
to
the
situation
here,
was
that
he
had
to
be
tried
for
murder
and
not
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
there
was
no
requirement
that
rauscher
be
returned
to
the
united
kingdom
where
he
had
found
asylum.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
he
might
have
to
be--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--before
he
is
tried
for
a
crime
other
than
that
for
which
the
nation
rendered
him
over.
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
this
case:
to
what
extent
does
the
extradition
treaty
operate
exclusively
with
respect
to
our
relationships
with
mexico,
and
i
think
it
is
vitally
important
for
me
to
make
one
point:
that
the
extradition
treaty
is
a
tool,
it
is
a
valuable
tool,
but
it
is
only
a
tool.
we
deal
with
the
government
of
mexico
quite
informally.
there
are
numerous
instances
of
informal
renditions
of
individuals
outside
the
treaty
terms.
there
have
been
instances
where
there
have
been
informal
renditions
of
individuals
where
it
would
appear
that
to
extradite
them
might
run
afoul
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty,
and
mexico
therefore
chooses,
for
political
reasons,
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
is
no
case
that
involves
those
specific
facts,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
i
concede
to
you.
what
i
do
not
concede
is
that
the
insight
of
ker
in
any
way
is
compromised
by
the
point
that
the
individual
happens
to
be
a
foreign
national,
and
when
the
court
thinks
as
to
the
circumstances
that
might
well
arise,
terrorism,
narcotrafficking,
there
may
very
well
be
circumstances
when
it
is
the
sober
judgment
of
the
united
states
government
that
extraordinary
action
is
required.
and
that
is
a
matter
that
is
entrusted
in
this
court,
speaking
initially
through
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
head
money
cases
and
in
the
ship
richmond
case
said
these
are
issues
ultimately
for
the
political
branches.
if
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
do
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
certainly
could
be
maintained
that
as
mexico
can
reasonably
maintain,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
mexico's
sovereignty,
and
in
your
hypothetical,
certainly
a
violation
of
sovereignty.
what
i
don't
want
to
readily
concede,
justice
scalia,
is
that
a
violation
of
sovereignty
is
necessarily
a
violation
of
international
law,
of
customary
international
law.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
answer
is
no.
it
is
the
territorial
integrity
that
would
have
been
compromised.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
certainly
clear
from
the
standpoint
of
the
nation
that
its
sovereignty
has
been
violated,
and
that
is
a
very
serious
matter.
chief
justice
marshall
in
ship
richmond
said
that
is
a
matter
for
the
political
branches.
indeed,
in
the
head
money
cases
he
said
this
is
a
matter
that
may
entail
the
most
delicate
kind
of
contretemps
between
nations,
including
the
possibility
of
hostilities,
but
of
this,
the
courts
are
to
have
no
cognizance.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
are
in
fact
episodes,
in
fact,
at
footnote
23
of
our
opening
brief
we
do
recount
a
situation
which
is
quite
similar
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
in
terms
of
what
this
country
would
do,
in
fact,
what
we
saw
in
the
sidney
chaffee
case
i
think
is
quite
illustrative.
individuals
go
into
canada
and
kidnap
a
canadian
businessman
and
bring
him
to
the
united
states
to
stand
trial.
it
would
not
be
our
position,
justice
blackmun,
that
notwithstanding
the
affront
to
canada's
sovereignty
or
to
mexico's
sovereignty
or
to
the
united
states'
sovereignty,
that
the
courts
of
those
countries
were
divested
of
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
narrow
point
that
we
are
making,
that
these
are
matters
that
are
entrusted
to
the
political
branches
through
the
diplomatic
process,
to
examine
and
to
explore
and
to
resolve.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
you
need
to
assume
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
international
law,
but
we
are
prepared,
justice
kennedy,
to
say
that,
assuming
arguendo
that
there
was,
nonetheless,
the
government's
position
should
prevail.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
do
not
concede
that
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law
but
for
purposes
of
argument,
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
if
there
were
a
violation
of
international
law,
still
ker-frisbie
applies,
just
as
it
applies
when
there
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
there
clearly
was
a
violation
of
international
law--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
have
to
respectfully
disagree
that
there
was
at
least
a
violation
of
peruvian
sovereignty
by
virtue
of...
as
the
court
has
described
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
he
was
nonetheless,
and
this
court...
when
i
read
the
court's
opinion
in
ker
it
does
not
place
any
emphasis
at
all
or
any
significance
on
that
individual's
status
as
an
american
citizen
and
as
a
fugitive--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
rauscher,
again,
talks
about
the
point,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
as
embodied,
as
reflected
in
the
fact
that
the
extradition
treaty
with
mexico
incorporates
the
specialty
principle,
but
that
is
a
narrow
principle--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
it
does,
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
point.
one
of
the
reasons,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is
somewhat
impracticable
to
proceed
under
the
extradition
treaty
is
that
mexico
has
no
obligation
to
extradite
its
nationals.
the
united
states
will
and
does.
the
government
of
mexico
has
never
extradited
one
of
its
nationals
under
the
terms
of
an
extradition
treaty.
it
has
done
so
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
is
no
question
we
have
a
right
under
article
9.2
to
have
it
submitted--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
with
all
respect
that
would
be
a
misimpression.
first
of
all,
and
foremost
is
the
legal
backdrop
of
our
negotiation,
justice
o'connor,
of
this
treaty.
this
treaty,
along
with
our
102
other
treaties,
was
negotiated
against
the
backdrop
of
ker-frisbie,
which
has
been
very
generally
understood
throughout
the
world,
but
certainly
by
the
courts
of
this
nation
as
meaning
that
courts
are
not
divested
of
jurisdiction
even
if
there
is
an
unlawful
abduction.
but
now
let
me
move
to
the
treaty.
i
think,
with
all
respect,
that
represents
an
overreading
of
the
treaty.
the
treaty
in
various
terms
speaks
in
terms
of
requesting,
the
party
requesting
and
invoking
the
treaty.
if
i
leave
nothing
else
with
the
court
other
that
ker-frisbie,
it
is
this:
the
extradition
treaty
is
employed
only
in
some
cases.
we
continue
to
have
relations
with
mexico
informally
outside
the
umbrella
of
the
treaty,
including
when
the
terms
of
the
treaty
would
be
violated.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
and
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
individuals
should
not
be
seen
as
having
enforceable
rights
under
this
particular
treaty.
which
in
contrast
to
the
practice
that
is
embodied
in
the
treaty
at
rauscher,
this
is
a
treaty
that
should
not
be
seen
as
giving
rise
to
privately
enforceable
rights,
even--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well
certainly,
it
can
be
argued
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
treaty...
but
my
point
is
a
very
important
and
narrow
one
here,
which
is
this
treaty
was
crafted
with
this
backdrop
in
mind
of
ker-frisbie.
and
if,
if
what
we
wanted
to
accomplish
was
what
has
been
suggested
by
the
other
side,
then
there
was
a
very
readily
available
tool;
the
harvard
project,
in
1935,
crafted
a
proposed
insertion
in
extradition
treaties,
article
16,
this
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
that's
quite
clear
that
the
court
shall
not
proceed
under
those
circumstances.
there
is
nothing
here
at
all
in
the
treaty
itself
about
the
courts
being
divested
of
jurisdiction.
and
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
it's
all
right
to
proceed
with
the
prosecution
if
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
but
a
violation,
at
most
accepting
the
other
side's
submission,
of
an
implied
obligation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
do
not,
and
they
do
not
for
a
reason.
we
would
not
readily
accede
to
such
a
limitation
on
the
ability
of
the
executive
branch
under
various
circumstances
to
proceed
by
other
means;
and
certainly
not
to
give
an
argument
or
a
right
to
an
individual
to
say,
i
do
not
have
to
face
these
serious
charges
against
me
by
virtue
of
my
reading
of
an
implied
obligation
in
the
treaty,
or
in
that
instance,
an
express
obligation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
unless
we
were
willing
to
engage...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
unless
we
were
willing
to
enter
into
a
webster-ashburton
type
treaty
and
then
bind
ourselves
with
respect
to
the
doctrine
of
specialty.
we've
done
that
here,
but
that's
all
that
we
have
done.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
we
would
not
concede
that
they
do.
we
certainly
do
understand
the
point
of
the
government
of
mexico
that
its
sovereignty
was
violated,
but
by
virtue...
the
record
is
not
terribly
extensive
in
this
case,
but
footnote
2
at
least
adumbrates
briefly
the
background.
that
is
to
say,
no
dea
agents
were
in
the
territory
of
the
government
of
mexico,
and
this
activity
followed
on
the
heels
of
informal
discussions
with
representatives
of
the
government
of
mexico.
we
did
not,
in
fact,
physically
intrude
directly
into
the
territorial
integrity
of
the
government
of
mexico,
but
we
do
not
suggest
that
these
were
not
our
agents.
but
in
terms
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
or
not
of
the
u.n.
charter
and
the
like,
i
think
the
law
is
clear,
justice
souter,
that
that
does
not
give
rise
to
privately
enforceable
rights.
again,
what
underlies,
i
think,
the
ker-frisbie
doctrine,
is
the
principle
that
it's
not
for
courts
to
involve
themselves
in
these
sorts
of
very
delicate
determinations
as
to
whether
there
were
violations
of
international
law
and
the
like;
that
these
are
matters
that
are
to
be
adjusted
between
the
governments
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
and
any
other
affected
country.
and
that's
the
assurance
that
the
court
has.
we
are
held
to
account
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
which
knows
how
to
legislate.
i
should
add,
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
the
webster-ashburton
treaty,
that
the
court
was
not
of
one
voice
in
that
case.
as
you
will
recall,
there
was,
of
course,
the
dissent
by
chief
justice
white.
but
more
than
that,
one
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
one--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--and
what
the
majority
said,
justice
stevens,
is
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
those
two
statutes
had
clearly
made
its
view
known.
and
the
point
i
was
making
to
justice...
may
i
conclude
with
justice
souter?
the
point
i
was
making
with
justice
souter
is
congress
knows
how
to
step
in
and
legislate.
it
has
done
through...
done
so
through
the
mansfield
amendment.
it
did
so
in
the
legal
backdrop
of
webster-ashburton,
and
the
court
did
place
emphasis
on
that
and
we
think
that
was
an
important
aspect
of
the
case.
that
is
not
so
here.
there
are
no
confirming
statutes
here.
this
is
a
very
general
treaty.
there's
no...
and
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
admit
there's
no
express
treaty
provision,
and
it
is
extraordinary--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
miller's
opinion
is
quite
scholarly,
lengthy,
much
of
it
can
be
referred
to
as
dicta,
but
i
do
think
that
he
was
placing
emphasis...
my
reading
may
be
different
with
all
respect,
was
placing
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
its
understanding
of
this
treaty,
with
the
doctrine
of
specialty,
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
they
created
it
against
the
backdrop
of
the
practice
of
nations.
and
when
you
look--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
when...
when
you
look
at
what
ker
did,
justice
stevens,
in
the
last
page
of
the
opinion
it
spoke
about
authorities
of
the
highest
respectability,
including
state
law
authorities,
state
v.
brewster
out
of
vermont
in
1835
involving
the
abduction
of
an
individual
from
canada.
and
the
vermont
supreme
court
said,
and
this
court
unanimously
said
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
these
are
authorities
of
the
highest
respectability,
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
question
how
that
individual
came
from
canada
into
vermont,
if
he
was
kidnapped.
and
ker
then
went
on,
what
happens
if
there
is
that
sort
of
violation?
an
individual
may
find
himself
extradited
to
canada
to
stand
trial
for
kidnapping.
there
are
other
remedies
that
are
available.
there
are
obviously
diplomatic
and
political
remedies
that
are
available,
ker
noted
that.
but
that
the
cost
to
society,
i
think
that
was
an
insight
of
justice
harlan
in
united
states
v.
blue,
the
costs
to
society
are
simply
too
great
to
say
because
you
came,
in
our
view,
unlawfully
into
our
jurisdiction,
we're
going
to
divest
ourselves
of
jurisdiction.
that
is
a
very
heavy
cost
for
society
to
bear,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
think
justice
black
spoke
so
forcefully
to
this
in
frisbie
itself,
where...
the
assertion
there,
interstate,
not
going
across
international
lines
to
be
sure,
but
there
was
an
allegation
of
a
severe
beating
and
a
violation
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act,
and
justice
black
said
no.
there
may
be
a
violation
of
law
and
there
may
be
remedies
for
those
violations
of
law,
but
if
you
have
been
charged
with
a
crime,
you
have
to
stand
trial
for
that
crime.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
our...
our
territorial
sovereignty
would
be
equally
violated
in
each
instance.
i
think
our
sense
of
violation
is
obviously
enhanced
if
one's
own
citizen
is
affected.
but
the
key
point,
the
nationality
principle...
but
it
still
would
not
be
our
position,
justice
stevens,
that
the
courts
of
mexico
were
divested
of
jurisdiction.
that's
exactly
what
we
told,
with
all
respect,
the
government
of
mexico
in
the
episode
that
we
recount
in
footnote
23,
the
martinez
episode.
they
come
across...
there
is,
in
fact,
an
abduction
from
mexico
into
the
united
states.
we
say
that
was
improper.
martinez
has
to
go
back
to
stand
trial
in
mexico
for
kidnapping.
we
responded
to
the
extradition
request,
but
we
told
the
government
of
mexico,
with
all
respect,
i'm
sorry,
the
courts
are
not
divested
of
jurisdiction,
that
was
the
holding
of
the
ker
case.
and
we
think
the
ker
case
spoke
in
very
broad
terms,
including
looking
at
english
authorities,
which
are
very
much
to
the
same
effect.
the
authorities
throughout,
and
especially
in
this
country,
have
been
that
there
is
no
reason
for
a
court
not
to
try
a
case
just
because
of
an
unlawful
apprehension.
let
other
remedies
suffice,
but
the
remedy
of
divesting
the
court
of
jurisdiction
is
too
heavy
a
cost
and
it
also,
quite
frankly
in
my
judgment,
tranches
on
separation
of
powers
concerns,
especially
when
the
order
is
to
repatriate
the
individual
against
the
will
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well
he
is
subject
to...
i
think
if
a
careful
parsing
of
92,
by
the
way
is
given,
all
that
92
says
is
that
it
shall
be
submitted
to
the
proper
authorities.
there's
no
requirement
of
prosecution,
there's
the
requirement
of
submitting
the
matter
to
prosecutorial
authority.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
my
final
point
with
respect
to
that
is
that
does
not
vindicate
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
united
states.
it
is
critical
to
note
that
enrique
camarena
was
tortured
and
murdered
when
he
was
serving
in
his
official
capacity
trying
to
stop
the
flow
of
drugs
from
mexico
into
the
united
states.
and
the
district
court
found
that
it
had
extra...
that
it
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that
is
crystal
clear,
and
that
distinguishes
this
from
a
crime
that
might
somehow
indirectly
affect
the
interests
of
the
united
states
that
carried...
that
is
carried
on
overseas.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
the
court
did
not
come...
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
case.
i
understand
it
to
be
the
case
that
the
practice
of
nations
was
one
that
had
given
rise
to
various
disputes.
the
court
in
rauscher
then
examined
that
practice
and
then
examined
the
specific
context
of
the
webster-ashburton
treaty
itself,
came
to
the
view
that
the
doctrine
of
specialty
was
in
fact
understood
to
be
a
resolution
of
the
conflict
in
that
particular
instance,
and
then
secondly
that
that
understanding
was
confirmed
by
statutes
passed
by
congress,
so
that
briefly
is
our
understanding
of
rauscher.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the...
my...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
my
understanding
of
the
treaty,
i
take
it
at
its
terms,
is
that
they
shall
submit
it
to
the
prosecution,
but
it's
up
to
the
prosecution
to
then
determine
to
the
appropriate
authorities.
we
would
simply
submit
it
to
the
government
of
mexico,
but
there's
no
express
obligation
in
9(2)
for
a
prosecution
to
actually
be
brought.
there's...
it
would
be
completely
consistent
with
the
literal
language
of
the
treaty
for
the
prosecution
to
be
declined.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
the
treaty
by
its
terms--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--requires...
obviously,
the
parties
to
any
contract
or
covenant
or
compact
should
proceed
in
good
faith,
but
nonetheless
there
is
no
specific
requirement.
now,
very,
very
briefly,
legal
backdrop
is
very
important.
this
court
has
said
that
recently,
that
the
legal
context
is
important,
and
therefore
the
understanding
of
ker
is
quite
important.
the
executive
branch
has
relied
on
our
understanding
of
ker,
and
when
we
look
to
what
ker
itself
says
in
addition,
as
confirmed
by
what
justice
black
said
in
frisbie
v.
collins,
what
justice
miller
said
in
citing
his
authorities
of
highest
respectability,
it
was
not
only
common
law
authorities
but
english
authorities,
including
his
lead
authority
was
an
english
authority
where
an
individual
had
been
seized
in
belgium
by
an
english
police
officer,
and
yet
the
principle
stood
that
the
court
does
not
divest
itself
of
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
a
forcible
or
illegal,
flagrant
if
you
will,
kidnapping,
the
point
remains
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
remains
intact.
that
is
the
legal
backdrop.
it
was
reaffirmed
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
mexico
as
justice
kennedy
noted.
that
has
been
our
clear
understanding,
and
more
than
that,
those
who
believe
that
the
practice
of
international
relations
should
be
more
enlightened
have
had
a
proposed
provision
there
on
the
books
for
almost
a
half-century
in
the
harvard
project.
it
has
not
found
its
way
into
a
single
one
of
our
treaties.
that
i
think
is
terribly
important.
i
thank
the
court.
