we'll

now
in
no.
91-712,
united
states
v.
humberto
alvarez-machain.
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
mr.
hoffman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
you
are
saying
maybe
it's
mexico's
right
and
not
the
individual's
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
an
individual's
right
can
be
defeated
by
mexico
saying
we
don't
care--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--doesn't
that
suggest
then
that
it's
the
foreign
sovereign's
right
and
that
the
individual
may
be
a
third-party
beneficiary
so
long
as
that...
but
it
isn't
primarily
the
individual's
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
agree
that
if
mexico
had
not
protested
this
and
said
we
don't
care
about
this,
then
the
treaty
would
not
bar
the
trial
of
this
person?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
there
were
a
case
concededly
controlling
from
this
court,
governing
a
particular...
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
mexico
knew
about
the
case
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
the
holding
of
ker,
the
teaching,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
has
not
been
understood
in
the
international
community
as
broadly
as
the
government
is
saying
it
has?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
hoffman,
certainly
the
court
in
frisbie
read
ker
very
broadly.
it
said
this
court
has
never
departed
from
the
rule
announced
in
ker
that
the
power
of
a
court
to
try
a
person
for
a
crime
is
not
impaired
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
brought
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
a
forcible
abduction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
you're
right
that
the
fact
that
it
was
a
governmental
kidnapping
is
important,
there
was...
it's
a
governmental
kidnapping
in
frisbie,
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
should
the
treaty
obligations
be
more
important
when
a
court
is
determining
jurisdiction
than
perhaps
violations
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
really
doesn't
distinguish
them
from
a
constitutional
principle.
in
fact,
as
you
concede,
a
treaty
is
subordinate
to
the
constitution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
in
this
case
the
accused
murderer
perhaps
never
will
be
tried.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
general
starr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
general
starr,
may
i
ask
you
one
quick
question
before
you
get
onto
what
you're
otherwise
going
to
say?
do
you
understand
the
rule
of
specialty
to
have
been
a
customary
principle
of
international
law,
so
that
technically
its
inclusion
in
this
treaty
would
have
been
unnecessary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
91-712,
united
states
versus
alvarez-machain.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
was
forcibly
abducted
from
his
home
in
mexico
and
flown
by
private
plane
to
texas
where
he
was
arrested
by
united
states
authorities
for
his
participation
in
the
torture
and
murder
of
enrique
comerena,
an
agent
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
the
district
court,
before
which
alvarez
was
to
be
tried,
concluded
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
him
because
his
abduction
violated
the
extradition
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
mexico.
the
district
court
accordingly
ordered
that
alvarez
be
repatriated
to
mexico.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
based
on
one
of
its
prior
decisions
and
on
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
united
states
had
participated
indirectly
in
respondents
abduction.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
respondent
must
stand
trial
on
the
torture
and
murder
charges
brought
against
him.'
the
general
rule
applicable
in
these
cases
is
known
as
the
ker
frisbie
doctrine
which
was
summarized
for
a
unanimous
court
half
a
century
ago
by
justice
black
in
these
words,
"this
court
has
never
departed
from
the
rule
that
the
power
of
a
court
to
try
a
person
for
crime
is
not
impaired
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
brought
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
forceable
abduction."
these
cases
rest
on
the
sound
basis
that
due
process
of
law
is
satisfied
when
one
present
in
court
is
convicted
of
crime
after
having
been
thoroughly
upraised
of
the
charges
against
him
and
after
a
fair
trial
in
accordance
with
constitutional
procedural
safeguards.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
a
court
to
permit
a
guilty
person
rightfully
convicted
to
escape
justice
because
he
was
brought
to
trial
against
his
will.
respondent
relies
on
the
case
of
rauscher
against
the
united
states
which
was
authored
by
justice
miller
who
also
wrote
the
ker
opinion
and
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as
the
ker
case
in
1885.
in
rauscher,
we
held
that
a
person
brought
before
the
court
as
a
result
of
proceedings
under
an
extradition
treaty
could
only
be
tried
for
one
of
the
offenses
described
in
that
treaty.
but
the
principle
of
rauscher
does
not
apply
to
the
present
case
in
our
view
because
the
activities
of
the
united
states
in
indirectly
participating
in
the
respondent's
abduction
from
mexico
did
not
violate
the
extradition
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
mexico.
that
treaty
did
not
purport
to
be
an
exhaustive
list
of
the
means
by
which
one
of
the
countries
might
gain
custody
over
a
national
of
the
other
country
for
purposes
of
prosecution.
the
history
of
its
negotiation
and
the
practice
under
it
confirms
this
view.
respondent
contends
that
internation
abductions
are
so
clearly
prohibited
under
international
law
that
the
treaty
should
be
read
to
include
such
a
prohibition.
but
it
would
be
contrary
to
our
precedent
and
practice
to
imply
such
a
term
in
the
treaty
from
general
principles
unrelated
to
the
law
of
extradition.
the
republic
of
mexico
has
protested
the
abduction
of
respondent
through
diplomatic
notes,
but
the
decision
of
whether
he
should
be
returned
to
mexico
even
though
such
return
is
not
required
by
the
treaty,
is
a
matter
for
the
executive
branch
to
decide.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
therefore,
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined.
