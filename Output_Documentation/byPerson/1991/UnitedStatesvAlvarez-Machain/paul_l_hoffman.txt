mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
does
depend
on
a
choice
between
the
line
of
authority
that
begins
with
ker
v.
illinois
and
the
line
of
authority
that
begins
with
united
states
v.
rauscher,
and
in
the
line
of
authority
starting
with
united
states
v.
rauscher,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
on
several
occasions,
an
unbroken
chain
of
occasions,
in
johnson
v.
brown,
in
the
ford
case,
in
united
states
v.
cook,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
the
authority
of
the
united
states
can
be
limited
by
treaty
obligations.
that
is
the
basic
principle
of
rauscher
and
rauscher
really
stands
as
an
answer
to
all
of
the
arguments
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case.
in
the
rauscher
case,
there
was
no
explicit
rule
of
specialty,
in
the
webster-ashburton
treaty
of
1842,
nor
was
there
any
explicit
mention
that
a
violation
of
the
rule
of
specialty
would
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
in
fact,
in
that
case
there
had
been
a
conviction
of
somebody.
mr.
rauscher
had
been
convicted.
he
was
physically
before
the
court,
and
yet
this
court
decided
that
our
international
obligations
under
the
webster-ashburton
treaty
were
more
important
and
the
court
found
that
in
the
language
of
the
treaty,
in
the
manifest
purpose
and
object
of
the
treaty,
the
court
had
to
find
that
there
was
a
rule
of
specialty,
and
the
court
did
not
defer
to
the
executive
branch
version
of
that
rule
of
specialty.
in
fact,
there
had
been
a
diplomatic
controversy
raging
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain
for
more
than
a
decade
on
this
very
point,
and
the
british
government
had
made
its
position
very
clear
that
a
rule
of
specialty
was
required
because
of
the
background
rule
of
customary
law
that
the
parties
had
to
have
intended
by
creating
the
language
that
they
created
in
the
treaty,
which
is
the
same
argument
that
we
make
here.
the
government
of
mexico
has
made
it
very
clear
that
they
understood,
as
canada
understood,
that
extradition
treaties,
when
they
place
specific
limits
on
how
people
can
be
rendered,
mean
that.
the
deal
was
article
9,
with
respect
to
obtaining
the
presence
of
a
mexican
national
before
this
court.
that
was
the
deal
that
was
made,
and
in
the
context
of
that
treaty
and
its
purpose
and
the
entire
structure
of
it,
it
must
mean
that
the
united
states
is
not
free
to
kidnap
mexican
nationals
to
circumvent
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
justice
white,
it
would
be
our
view
based
on
the
language
of
the
treaty,
its
purpose
and
the
fact
that
it
is
the
exclusive
means,
that
americans
should
not
be
kidnapped
consistent
with
this
treaty
either,
because
the
limitations,
for
example,
on
the
political
offense
doctrine
and
the
other
limitations
in
the
treaty
also,
we
believe,
should
lead
a
court
to
conclude
that
kidnapping
to
circumvent
those
limitations
would
also
be
a
violation
of
the
treaty.
but
with
respect
to
article
9,
it
is
different.
there
are
very
few
cases
of
kidnapping,
there
are
very
few
cases...
there
are
no
cases
of
kidnapping
of
a
national
in
the
ker-frisbie
line
that
the
government
argues
is
a
backdrop.
article
9
makes
it
very
clear
what
the
deal
was
with
respect
to
mexican
nationals,
as
judge
browning
in
the
verdugo
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
one
could
base
a
decision,
a
court
could
base
a
decision
on
article
9
that
there
was
a
specific
arrangement,
but
our
belief
is
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--your
honor...
i'm
sorry...
justice
scalia,
what
article
9
does,
as
it
says,
if
you
want
to
obtain
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
mexican
national
you
have
two
alternatives.
i
mean,
the
alternatives
are
you
ask
and
either
extradition
will
be
granted
or
the
case
will
be
submitted
for
prosecution.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
kidnap
to
obtain
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
it
can't
be
understood
as
also
suggesting
that
a
kidnapping
in
violation
of
those
terms
would
be
proper.
the
history--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but
those
words
can't
be
read
in
isolation.
i
think
the
whole
text
of
the
treaty
indicates
that
the
parties
agreed
on
specific
limitations
on
how
you
would
get
jurisdiction,
and
it's
in
the
context
and
the
vienna
convention
and
the
rules
in
rauscher
indicate
that
one
has
to
read
those
treaty
terms
in
the
context.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
principle
in
rauscher
is
that
the
court
may
find
an
inherent
provision
that's
not
specifically
stated.
our
case
is
not
a
case
based
on
the
rule
of
specialty,
but
it's
based
on
an
even
more
fundamental
rule,
and
the
court's
analysis
in
rauscher
certainly
would
permit
this
court
to
look
to
the
background
rules
of
customary
law;
as
they
did
in
rauscher,
it
would
look
to
the
history,
where
secretaries
of
state
of
the
19th
century,
from
the
beginning
of
our
extradition
treaties
on
said
that
abductions
violated
the
treaty,
they
were
not
consistent.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
would
suggest
that
the
mexican
government
would
certainly
not
turn
over
a
mexican
national
because
of
the
restrictions--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
do
not
know
that
mexico
has
handed
over
a
national
in
the
course
of
our
relations.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no.
our
position--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
there
has
been
a
long
history
of
informal
relations
between
mexico
and
the
united
states,
and
those
are
perfectly
consistent
with
the
treaty
and
with
our
version
of
the
treaty,
our
position
on
the
treaty.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
if
mexico--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
mexico
has
the
ability
to
defease
that
right
from
him,
i
mean,
i
think
that
and
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
rauscher
and
the
specialty
cases.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no,
well,
it's
both.
it's
both
and
i
think
in
the
case
of
a--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--and
that
was
true
in
rauscher.
in
rauscher
great
britain
could
have
decided
to
allow
rauscher
to
be
tried
for
a
lesser
offense
than
the
murder
that
they
extradited
him
for.
that
is
true
in
every
specialty
case
that
the
foreign
sovereign
has
the
absolute
right
to
take
away
the
principle
of
specialty
that's
asserted
by
the
individual.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
there
is
a
long
history
in
this
country
of
self-execution,
of
the
notion
that
extradition
treaties
are
self-executing,
and
extradition
treaties
serve
different
purposes.
to
be
sure
they
serve
the
purposes
of
mutual
cooperation
and
law
enforcement,
but
they
also
serve
the
purpose
of
protecting
sovereign
interest
and
they
serve
the
purpose
of
protecting
individual
interest
and
that
has
been
understood
in
the
cases
from
the
very
beginning
which
have
given
individuals
the
rights
to
claim
interests
which
are
really
sovereign
rights
too.
in
this
particular
case,
the
sovereign
rights
and
the
individual
rights
are
almost
identical,
and
they
coincide
in
the
sense
that
for
a
mexican
national,
mexico
owes
a
duty
to
the
respondent
in
this
case
to
protect
him
and
offer
the
benefits
of
mexican
law,
and
so
when
they
are
asserting
their
sovereign
interests
to
prevent
the
united
states
from
circumventing
this
treaty
and
bringing
him
to
the
united
states
they
are
also
protecting
his
interests.
the
interests
are
really
in
the
same
alignment
in
this
case
and
under
rauscher
and
johnson
and
cases
before
and
after
that,
individuals
have
been
given
the
right
to
claim
benefits
under
treaties.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
if
mexico
had
given
its
consent,
i
think
that
would
be
very
similar
to
what
justice
o'connor
talked
about
with
respect
to
contracts.
if
mexico
and
the
united
states
enter
into
a
different
agreement
and
if
they
do
it
in
the
context
of
a
consensual
rendition,
then
it
is
true
that
that
respondent
would
not
have
the
ability
to
assert
this
right
in
the
court.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
with
respect
to
the
informal
renditions?
the
line
of...
first
of
all,
ker
v.
illinois
is
certainly
a
case
in
which
the
fact
of
an
absence
of
protest
by
peru
was
noted,
that
peru
did
not
assert
its
sovereign
interest
in
preventing
an
abduction
from
its
territory
to
the
extent
it
had
it,
that
the
court
was
very
clear
to
say
that
peru
had
not
asserted
that
right,
and
in
many
of
the
cases
that
have
followed
ker,
ker
is
the
only
international
abduction
case
in
this
court.
but
in
the
cases
since
then,
courts
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
point
out
that
the
foreign
sovereign
had
not
protested,
and
i
think
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
theory
that
the
foreign
sovereign
is
in
a
position
to
consent
to
a
rendition
outside
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
the
rule
of
specialty
would
apply
in
an
informal
case?
well,
there
is
certainly
some
authority.
this
court
has
not
decided
that
question,
there
is
certainly
authority
in
lower
courts
that
an
informal
rendition
would
include
a
rule
of
specialty.
that
is
not
an
issue
that
certainly
applies
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
clear,
unequivocal
protest,
there
is
no
doubt
about
mexico's
position.
there
is
also
no
doubt
about
the
violation
of
international
law,
and
in
reading
this
treaty
we
would
submit
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
united
states
can't
come
into
mexico
to
circumvent
the
prohibitions
in
article
9
of
the
treaty.
one
of
the
ways
to
look
at
it,
i
suppose,
is
that
the
u.s.
position
would
be
that
if
they
had
asked
for
extradition
formally
and
then
they
were
denied
and
mexico
said
instead
what
they
say
before
this
court,
we
will
not
extradite
dr.
alvarez-machain,
what
we
will
do
is
try
him
as
we
have
tried
many
others
associated
with
the
case,
allegedly
involved
in
the
camarena
case,
and
the
united
states
government
says,
no
that
doesn't
satisfy
us.
we
want
something
more
than
that,
and
so
we
will
kidnap
him.
presumably
if
the
request
had
been
made
then
that
would
violate
the
treaty.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--that
raises
different
questions,
clearly,
than
the
ones
upon
which
this
case
was
decided.
i
think
that
there
are
strong
arguments
for
the
authority
of
the
courts
to
enforce
a
customary
prohibition
in
international
law
in
this
case.
the
mollocoptus
principle
does
involve
a
violation,
this
kind
of
violation
and
a
protest
meaning
that
there
has
to
be
repatriation,
but
i
think
that
those
would
raise
very
different
questions
and
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
overcome
that
customary
principle
might
be
greater
than
in
the
case
of
a
treaty
where
the
courts
have
a
constitutional
role
that's
been
recognized.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
justice
o'connor,
there
were
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
that
were
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
courts
below.
those
have
not
been
ruled
upon
either
by
the
district
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
and
presumably
those
would
be
litigated
if
this
court
finds
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
treaty.
one
of
the
things
that,
to
return
to
rauscher
for
a
moment,
the
point
that
the
government
has
made
about
the
statutes
really
don't
amount...
this
court
has
already
rejected
that,
i
think
in
rauscher
and
johnson
v.
brown,
where
the
court
has
said
that
the
statutes
were
not
an
essential
ground
for
the
decision,
and
clearly
there
were
no
statutes
in
ford
and
cook
of
the
kind
that
the
government
claims.
nor
were
there
any
explicit
treaty
provisions
that
dealt
with
the
consequences
of
seizure
in
violation
of
the
treaty
limitations.
with
respect
to
the
ker-frisbie,
the
ker
doctrine,
the
government
has
claimed
that
ker
stands
for
a
much
broader
proposition
than
the
actual
decision
in
ker
would
suggest.
in
ker,
there
was
no...
under
our
presentation
of
this
case,
ker
would
be
decided
the
same
way.
in
ker
there
was
a
private
abduction
and
so
it
was
not
a
state-sponsored
case
of
kidnapping,
that's...
and
the
chaffee
case
that
was
mentioned
by
the
government
is
another
case
of
a
private
abduction
and
i
think
that
under
customary
law
and
under
what
mexico
and
canada
have
understood
this
treaty
to
mean,
it
is
state-sponsored
kidnapping
that
would
be
prohibited,
not
necessarily
a
private
abduction.
so
ker
is
limited
to
that
situation.
in
addition,
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
there
had
been
no
protest
and
therefore
peru's
sovereign
interests
were
not
at
stake,
and
that
that
is
a
key
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
case.
in
the
cases
since
ker,
the
courts
have,
the
cases
have
all
fallen
into
situations
where
there
has
been
consent
or
acquiescence
in
the
informal
renditions
or
where
there
had
been
private
abductions,
and
that's
true...
our
recitation
of
the
foreign
cases
which
says
that
they
appear
to
be
in
alignment
too,
that
really
the
ker
doctrine
that
the
government
claims
as
a
backdrop
principle
has
not
been
known
widely
in
the
world,
has
not
been
known
in
this
country,
and
certainly
would
not
have
been
known
to
mexico
as
meaning
that
the
united
states
could
engage
in
state-sponsored
kidnapping
and
that
that
would
not
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
try
somebody.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
ker
stands
for
a
broad
principle
that
notwithstanding
treaty
obligations
a
court
should
try
the
person
who
comes
before
it
no
matter
how
that
person
comes
before
it,
then
obviously
the
treaty
would
not,
well,
it
would
apply.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that's
correct,
and
i
don't
think
it's
been
understood
by
lower
court
cases.
now
there
is
some
broad
language
about
what
ker
means,
but
the
cases,
i
think,
have
been
very
careful
to
distinguish
between
the
different
situations
that
point
out
the
absence
of
protest
and
i
think
that
the
rauscher
line
stands
for
an
equally
important
line
of
authority
and
policy
interest.
what
this
court
said
in
johnson
v.
brown
was
that
treaty
obligations,
the
enforcement
in
good
faith
of
treaty
obligations
is
of
vital
importance
to
the
nation,
and
it
was
understood
from
the
beginning.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
the
martinez
case
is
a
different
case,
and
it
is
fully
consistent
with
the
position
that
we
are
asserting
before
this
court.
in
martinez
the
person
was
abducted...
excuse
me,
that
was
abducted
by
private
kidnappers.
mr.
felix
was
not
a
u.s.
government
agent
sent
across
the
border
to
capture
somebody.
a
private
abductor
brought
someone
across
the
border
and
the
united
states
took
the
position
that
ker-frisbie
applied
in
that
situation
and
there
was
no
violation
at
stake,
and
the
united
states
extradited
the
kidnappers,
and
so
the
martinez
incident
is--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but
justice
kennedy,
the
mexican
government
was
never
advised
and
the
united
states
has
never
asserted...
and
it's
my
belief
that
the
united
states
has
never
asserted
before
this
case
that
the
united
states
reserves
the
rights
with
its
extradition
partners
to
itself
engage
in
kidnapping
from
other
countries
to
avoid
the
limitations
and
extradition
treaties,
and
that's
our
main
point,
that
the
extradition
treaty...
and
this
is
the
point
that
mexico--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
justice
scalia,
the
limitation
is
the
fact
that
article
9
talks
about
how
the
united
states
may
obtain
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
mexican
national.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
article
9--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--article
9
comes
with
a
long
and
historical
heritage
in
the
sense
that
before
article
9
the
mexican
government
said
it
would
not
extradite
its
nationals.
in
every
one
of
the
extradition
treaties
before,
mexico
took
the
position
it
would
not
under
any
circumstances
extradite
nationals.
the
secretary
of
state,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
valentine
case
said
that
it
was
our
understanding
that
we
couldn't
even
ask
for
mexican
nationals.
it
would
be
inappropriate
under
the
treaty
to
do
that.
so
article
9
was
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
kinds
of
interests
that...
the
law
enforcement
interests
that
the
united
states
was
concerned
about,
and
so
what
mexico
gave
up
in
article
9,
it
said
number
1,
we
will
consider
extradition
for
the
first
time,
and
number
2,
if
we
decide
not
to
extradite,
as
it
is
our
right
not
to
do,
we
will
submit
the
case
for
prosecution.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
but
there's
no
prohibition
in...
no
explicit
prohibition
on
the
fact
that
you
can't
execute
summarily
the
person
that's
extradited,
or
you
can't
torture
them.
i
mean,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
understanding
that
states
have
when
they
enter
into
extradition
treaties,
and
it's
not
just
the
respondent
saying
it,
but
canada
has
said
it
to
this
court,
mexico
has
said
it
to
this
court,
that
the
u.s.
position
in
this
case
is
a
shocking
position
and
a
new
position,
and
it
is
understood,
just
as
it
was
understood
that
a
rule
of
specialty
should
be
found
to
be
part
of
the
webster-ashburton
treaty,
that
this
could
not
be
allowed,
and
just
as
words
were
added,
a
provision
was
added--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no,
it
would
be
shocking
in
both--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--there
was
a...
i
think
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
sense
that
just
because
the
united
states
engages
in
egregious
conduct
that
violates
basic
principles
of
the
international
legal
order
and
it
violates
them
in
many
different
ways
doesn't
mean
that
it
doesn't
also
violate
the
explicit
provisions...
the
clear
intent
of
this
treaty,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
there's
no...
mexico
has
explained
very
clearly
in
its
brief
why
it
believed
it
was
not
necessary
to
ask
the
united
states
for
such
an
explicit
provision,
because
it
never
believed
that
the
united
states
would
engage
in
that
conduct,
and
if
the
united
states
had
asked
for
that,
had
said
we
consider
this
to
be
optional,
if
we
want
to
ask
under
the
treaty
we'll
ask
under
the
treaty,
but
if
we
don't
ask
under
the
treaty,
we'll
kidnap,
they
said
they
would
have
picked
up
their
briefcases
and
left
and
we
wouldn't
have
extradition
treaties.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that
is
what
the
court
refers
to
in
rauscher,
that
it
had
been
the
custom
that
when
a
person
had
been
handed
over
in
that
manner
that
they
could
only
be
tried
for
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes,
it
was
a
customary--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
don't
know
if
i
can
answer
that.
i
believe
that
it
was
a
customary
prohibition,
but
i
cannot
answer
whether--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--my
understanding,
and
certainly
the
justice
friendly
decision
in
fiacani
would
suggest,
that
principles
of
international
comity
would
require
the
same
result,
that
if
someone
is
handed
over
informally
as
sovereign
nations
have
the
right
to
do
that
that
principle
would
still
obtain,
that
essentially
what
has
happened
is
that
the
state
that
has
handed
the
person
over
has
essentially
given
up
a
sovereign
right
to
give
that
person
asylum,
and
so
the
authority
is
limited
in
terms
of
prosecution
to
what...
to
that
piece
of
sovereignty
that
the
government
has
given
up.
and
i
think
that
extradition
treaties
have
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
those
sovereign
interests
that
this
court
has
recognized
from
the
beginning
of
its
work.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that's
true.
frisbie
reads
that
very
broadly
in
that
context,
but
the
frisbie
context
is
very
different.
under
the
extradition
clause
within
the
united
states,
for
example,
there
is
no
right...
sovereign
right
that
one
state
has
to
delay
or
deny
extradition
to
another,
and
so
there
are
no
sovereign
issues
there,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
may
be
used
to
remedy
that
kind
of
police
conduct.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
but
the
reason
that
it's
important
because
it's
a
governmental
kidnapping
is
that
it
invokes
our
treaty
obligations.
i
mean,
our--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
obviously
the
constitution
is
more
important
from
our
standpoint
as
americans
than
treaties,
but
treaties
have
been
very
important
to
this
country's
history,
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
treaties
may
place
a
limitation
on
the
authority
of
the
united
states
government
to
seize,
and
that
those
limitations
must
be
fulfilled,
and
it's
not
just
because
it's
a
treaty
obligation,
it's
because
those
treaty
obligations
are
part
of
a
web
of
international
relationships
that
are
essential
to
this
country,
and
have
been
thought
to
be
essential
to
this
country
from
the
beginning
of
time.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
the
constitution
does...
was
found
in
frisbie
not
to
place
limits
of
that
kind.
it
was
found
that
the
due
process
clause,
which
was
the
clause
that
was
relied
upon
in
frisbie,
was
found
to
be
satisfied
by
giving
that
person
a
fair
trial.
moreover,
the
only...
i
think
in
the
frisbie
type
case
there's
a
kind
of
inherent
futility.
if
you
send
the
person
back
as
a
remedy
for
that
violation
the
person
will
be
back
again,
so
unless
you
actually
affirmatively
grant
them
immunity
from
prosecution,
they're
going
to
be
tried
before
that
court
no
matter
what.
that's
not
true
here.
the
treaty
obligation
limits
the
authority,
and
in
fact
the
remedy
is
different
in
the
sense--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
don't
think
that
the
court
can
assume
that,
because
mexico
has--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no,
but
the
point
is
that
it
will
be
a
different...
what
will
happen
is
different,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
policies
of
frisbie
are
satisfied
to
some
degree
because
mexico
will
agree
to
prosecute.
mexico
has
stated
to
this
court
that
it
will
live
up
to
its
obligations
under
article
92,
and
it's
given
the
court
very
good
reason
for
believing
that
that's
true,
and
so
the
underlying
policies
of
ker-frisbie
about
immunity
from
prosecution
don't
apply
because
mexico
will
prosecute,
and
that's
the
bargain
that
the
united
states
made,
and
it
made
it
willingly,
that
mexico
would
be
able
in
a
case
like
this,
which
after
all
involves
also
a
murder
of
a
mexican
citizen.
the
events
occurred
in
mexico...
mexico
has
an
interest.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
but
that's
a
traditional
form
of
that
kind
of
treaty
provision--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
what
it
means
is
that...
and
the
united
states
insists
on
this
too,
that
obviously
there's
prosecutorial
discretion
based
on
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
presented.
the
united
states
hasn't
presented
evidence,
as
far
as
anyone
knows.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
no.
what
article
9
says--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
what
it
means
is
that
mexico
is
under
a
good
faith
international
obligation
to
submit
the
case
for
prosecution,
and
if
the
case
warrants
prosecution
it
will
prosecute,
and
that
is
the
same
arrangement
that
the
united
states
made.
i
mean,
the
united
states
has
made
no
great
a
commitment
to
mexico,
that
if
the
reverse
situation
is
the
case...
and
this
is
a
treaty
that
has
benefits
and
limitations
for
both
sides
that
are
important.
this
protects
americans,
too,
and
if
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot,
and
if
the
mexican
agents
come
into
the
united
states
to
los
angeles
and
kidnap
the
dea
agents
that
they
have
requested
under
the
extradition
treaty
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
anyone
would
believe
that
this
treaty...
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
this
treaty
to
go
outside
that
extradition
process
that's
set
up
by
the
treaty
and
to
kidnap
those
dea
agents,
bring
them
down
to
mexico,
and
say
that
it's
fine
for
them
to
be
tried.
the
treaty
cannot
be
read
that
way.
that
would
be...
i
think
it
would
be
blatantly
a
bad
faith
interpretation
of
the
treaty
to
allow
either
country
to
perform
in
that
way.
mr.
chief
justice,
i--
