justice
kennedy
do
we
decide
this
case,
general
starr,
on
the
assumption
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
international
law?
justice
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law?
justice
kennedy
but
you
don't
think
it
would
violate
the
treaty?
justice
kennedy
do
you?
justice
kennedy
well,
counsel,
i
think
your
point
that
this
was
not
against
a
background
where
mexico
knew
of
our
policy
is
much
diminished
in
force
by
the
government's
citation
of
a
letter
in
1906
from
the
acting
secretary
of
state
pointing
out
to
the
mexican
government
that
ker
is
on
the
books
and
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
follows
that
principle
with
reference
to
persons
taken
from
foreign
sovereignty.
justice
kennedy
but
the
point
is
that
the
mexican
government
has
been
advised
of
this
doctrine
and
of
its
applicability.
