justice
o'connor
--but,
general
starr,
the
treaty
in
article
9
does
say
that
if
mexico
doesn't
extradite
one
of
its
own
nationals,
that
nevertheless,
the
united
states
can
require
mexico
to
prosecute
the
person
there.
justice
o'connor
my
concern,
frankly,
is
that
it
is
not
so
clear
to
me
that
the
extradition
treaty
doesn't
contemplate
that
that
is
the
exclusive
process
to
be
followed.
when
you
read
article
2,
that
says
for
the
designated
offenses,
including
murder,
extradition
shall
take
place
subject
to
the
treaty,
and
if
you
look
at
article
9
which
says
the
country
doesn't
have
to
yield
up
its
own
nationals,
but
will
have
to
prosecute,
i
think
one
could
come
away
thinking
the
treaty
covers
this
case.
justice
o'connor
but
isn't
that
always
possible,
that
parties
to
a
treaty,
like
parties
to
a
contract,
can
agree
to
some
other
specific
arrangement?
justice
o'connor
don't...
don't
extradition
treaties,
if
they
apply
routinely,
give
rise
to
individual
enforceable
rights
that
they--
justice
o'connor
what
is
your
case
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
o'connor
mr.
hoffman,
assuming
that
the
kidnapping
was
a
violation
of
international
law,
do
you
assert
that
gives
a
u.s.
court
any
power
to
remedy
the
situation?
justice
o'connor
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
of
the
individual?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
to
conclude
the
treaty
doesn't
cover
this,
do
you
fall
back
on
some
violation
of
international
law?
