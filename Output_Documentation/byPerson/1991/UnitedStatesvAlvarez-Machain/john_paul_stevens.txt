justice
stevens
--before
you
get
into
your
argument,
why
is
this
case
a
little
different
than
some
of
the
other
ker-frisbie
cases,
has
the
doctrine
ever
been
applied
to
a
case
involving
the
crime
committed
in
another
country
by
a
national
of
that
country?
justice
stevens
so
this
is
a
unique...
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression?
justice
stevens
but
in
the
rauscher
case,
of
course,
that
was
critical
how
the
individual--
justice
stevens
--and
they
also
emphasized
the
fact
that
he
was
a
fugitive
and
an
american
citizen,
whereas
the
facts
here
are
much
different.
justice
stevens
but
you
do
concede
that
if
there
were
a
violation
of
the
treaty,
that
the
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
he
would
have
to
return
before
he
could
be
tried
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
stevens
that's
what
the
case
holds--
justice
stevens
--it
is
perfectly
clear,
there
is
no
precedent
for
our
kidnapping
a
foreign
national
when
that
national's
country
is
asserting
jurisdiction
over
him.
justice
stevens
but
there
is
no
violation
of
international
law
in
either
ker
or
frisbie.
justice
stevens
maybe
civilian
law
possibly,
but
the
man
did
not
have
an
asylum
status
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
but
he
did
not
have
asylum
status,
he
was
a
mere
fugitive.
justice
stevens
--makes
that
point
critical--
justice
stevens
--it
has
the
distinction
between
mexican
nationals
and
those
who
are
not
mexican
nationals
doesn't
it--
justice
stevens
justice
white
made
the
argument
that
there's
nothing
express
in
the
treaty.
justice
stevens
but
the
majority
said
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
be
express.
justice
stevens
upon
the
statute
point
in
the
case
you
refer
to,
one
justice
concurred
separately
on
that
ground
alone.
justice
stevens
the
court
as
a
whole
did
not
regard
that
as
an
essenatial
part
of
its
decision,
it
was
the
second
ground
of
its
decision.
justice
stevens
--created
it
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
the
state
law
decisions
were
their
principal
reliance.
state
court
decisions
in
the
united
states.
justice
stevens
general
starr,
let
me
just
go
back
to
one
point,
and
then
i'll...
i'm
taking
more
of
your
time
than
i
should,
i
realize.
do
you
think
you
can
compare
two
cases?
suppose
if
a
mexican
fugitive
fled
into
texas
and
was
kidnapped
by
mexican
authorities
and
brought
back
into
mexico
on
the
one
hand.
in
the
other
case
they
came
in
and
apprehended
an
american
citizen
in
texas
and
took
him
to
mexico.
do
you
think
they
would
be
equally
offensive
to
our
sovereignty,
or
do
you
think
our
sovereignty
would
be
more
offended
by
the
kidnapping
of
the
american
citizen
as
contrasted
with
the
mexican
fugitive?
justice
stevens
can
i
suggest
one
thing
on
the
costs.
in
the
other
cases,
if
the
american
tribunal
can't
try
him,
he's
not
going
to
be
tried
at
all.
whereas
here
it's
not
the
same
cost,
because
he's
subject
to
trial
in
the
state
from
which
he
was
abducted.
justice
stevens
well,
at
least
he's
subject
to
prosecution
there,
whereas
in
the
peru
case--
justice
stevens
--the
man
was
not
subject
to
prosecution
in
peru.
justice
stevens
mr.
hoffman,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
text
of
the
treaty?
article
17
does
have
the
rule
of
specialty
and
it's
spelled
out
in
careful
detail.
was
that
a
customary
provision
in
extradition
treaties
before
the
rauscher
decision?
justice
stevens
was
that
a
custom
independently
of
any
written
language
in
treaties--
justice
stevens
--or
was
it
a
customary
provision
of
treaties?
justice
stevens
it
makes
a
big
difference
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stevens
the
opinion
itself
doesn't
refer
to
any
such
provision
in
the
treaty,
and
i
had
assumed
that
they
had
implied
that
that
was
just
a
fair
way
to
read
the
treaty,
that
if
we
followed
the
procedure--
justice
stevens
--if
the
evidence
was
adequate?
justice
stevens
i
understand
what
the
treaty
by
its
terms
said.
