justice
white
how
about
americans
in
mexico
who
are
charged
with
having
committed
a
crime,
in
america?
justice
white
you
don't
suggest
that
mexico
could
not
have
voluntarily
turned
over...
turned
over
one
of
their
nationals
for
a
trial
in
the
united
states?
justice
white
would
it
violate
the
treaty?
justice
white
has
it
ever
happened?
justice
white
so
it
wouldn't
be
that
the
treaty
would
not
be
the
only
way
of
securing
the
presence
of
a
mexican
national
in
the
united
states?
justice
white
you
don't
think
that
if
mexico
turned
over
one
of
its
citizens
informally,
not
under
the
treaty,
would
the
defendant
have
a--
justice
white
--if
they
turned
him
over
and
he
was
being...
he
was
charged
with
a
crime
here,
would
he
have
a
valid
motion
for
dismissal
of
the
case?
justice
white
well,
suppose
that
it
happened
in
this
case
and
the
united
states,
well,
do
you
think
the
rule
of
specialty
would
apply
then?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
that
was
your
point
that
you
were
just
making.
