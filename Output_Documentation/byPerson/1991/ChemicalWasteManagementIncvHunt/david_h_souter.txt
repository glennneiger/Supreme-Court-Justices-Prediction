justice
souter
of
course
if
alabama
could
prove
that
there
was
no
safe
way
to
dispose
of
this
stuff
you
would
lose,
wouldn't
you?
justice
souter
because
then
you'd
be
in
the
same,
you'd
be
in
the
same
category
as
the
quarantine
cases.
justice
souter
so
in
effect
you're
saying,
as
i
guess
you
did
to
justice
scalia,
that
it's
got
to
be
an
all
or
nothing
rule?
justice
souter
mr.
kneedler,
what
if
the
state
decided
to
start
all
over
again
from
scratch
and
it
could
prove
that
in
fact
there
was
no
safe
way
to
handle
the
stuff,
that
in-state,
out-of-state,
it
was
all
a
health
hazard
regardless
of
what
the
federal
government
was
saying.
does
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
enacted
this
comprehensive
scheme
for
regulating
transportation
and
treatment,
or
would
that
fact
in
effect
bar
us
from
considering
the
state's
proof?
in
other
words,
has
the
congressional
action
in
effect
said
this
material
is
going
to
be
treated,
must
be
treated
for
commerce
clause
purposes
as
an
article
of
commerce
which
is
not
subject
to
the
quarantine
rules.
