mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
very
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
was
to
establish
an
area
of
free
trade
among
the
states
and
not
to
permit
a
multiplication
of
isolated
trade
zones
within
each
of
the
separate
states.
and
the
commerce
clause
has
been
consistently
construed
by
this
court
to,
of
its
own
force
in
a
self-executing
manner
to
prohibit
barriers
imposed
by
the
states
to
the
free
movement
of
commerce
among
the
states.
in
particular
where
a
statute
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce,
that
statute
can
be
sustained
only
if
it
serves
a
legitimate
local
purpose
and
if
there
is
no
available,
excuse
me,
non-discriminatory
means
to
accomplish
it.
beyond
that
in
the
special
area
of
taxation,
which
we
have
here,
the
only
discriminatory
taxes
that
have
been
sustained
have
been
ones
that
are
in
fact
not
discriminatory
because
they
are
designed
to
equalize
a
tax
burden,
excuse
me,
to
compensate
for
a
tax
imposed
on
in-state
interest.
now
those
purposes
are
present
entirely
in
this
current
situation.
hazardous
wastes
are
generated
as
the
by-product
of
essential
industries
in
interstate
commerce,
petrochemicals,
petroleum
refining,
others.
to
exempt
an
in-state
industry
from,
generator
of
hazardous
wastes,
from
the
payment
of
a
fee
that
out-of-state
waste
generators
have
to
pay
is
exactly
the
sort
of
discrimination
in
favor
of
local
industries
against
out-of-state
industries
that
the
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
prohibit.
beyond
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
does,
but
there
are
several
ways
to
look
at
the
quarantine
cases.
one
of
them
is
that,
as
the
response
to
the
chief
justice
illustrated
a
short
time
ago,
in
fact
the
quarantine
cases
are
a
subset
of
the
category
in
which
the
state
interest
could
not
be
served
by
any
non-discriminatory
manner.
but
there's
another
element
of
the
quarantine
cases
which
simply
is
not
present
here
but
i
think
is
an
essential
element,
and
that
is
the
element
of
imminence
of
the
risk,
urgency
of
the
risk.
a
quarantine
is
an
emphatic
and
swift
remedy
for
a
perceived
urgent
problem.
in
fact
in
the
hannibal
and
st.
joseph
railroad
case
on
which
alabama
relies,
the
court
described
the
quarantine
cases
as
essentially
grounded
in
self-defense.
and
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
self-defense
is
imminence.
you
are
only
entitled
to
take
that
action
if
there
is
an
imminent
harm.
and
in
clason,
for
example,
one
of
the
cases
cited,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
animals
would
begin
to
decay
and
cause
harm
within
24
hours.
none
of
that
is
present
here
in
particular.
the
hazardous
wastes,
as
mr.
pincus
described,
are
subject
to
a
comprehensive
cradle
to
grave
federal
regulatory
scheme.
from
the
time
of
generation
through
storage
through
transportation
through
treatment
and
disposal
they
are
subject
to
a
uniform
minimum
set
of
standards
which
can
be
supplemented
by
the
states
precisely
to
guard
against
those
sorts
of
imminent
risks.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
an
absolute
bar.
i
think
alabama's
burden
would
be
weighty
indeed,
because
congress
has,
by
taking
this
problem
firmly
in
hand
and
by
treating
what
might
otherwise
be
a
local
activity
such
as
the
generation
of
waste
in
the
same
way
that
raising
cattle
might
ordinarily
be
local,
but
by
taking
it
entirely
in
hand
in
this
federal
regulatory
scheme
and
including
the
transportation
of
waste,
congress
has
really
treated
it
as
a
national
problem.
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
there
has
been
a
national
interstate
industry
growing
up
around
the
various
aspects
of
hazardous
waste.
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs
there
are,
as
a
consequence
of
the
federal
statute
and
amendments
to
it
there
are
important
incentives
to
adopt
treatment
of
hazardous
waste
before
they
can
be
disposed
in
land
disposal
sites.
and
those
treatment
requirements
are
often
capital
intensive,
and
it
would
be
duplicative
at
best
and
counter-productive
at
worst
to
require
a
landfill
in
every
state
in
fact
to
require
the
various
types
of
disposals
of
hazardous
wastes
in
all
of
the
50
states.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
every
state
in
the
union
exports
some
hazardous
waste,
and
the
average
state
exports
to
19
other
states
to
take
advantage
of
at
least
12
disposal
or
treatment
sorts
of
technologies.
so
what
has
grown
up
partly
under
the
impetus
of
the
regulatory
scheme
which
has
become
much
more
complex
since
the
time
this
court
considered
rcra
in
the
background
of
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
has
been
one
that
treats
this
problem
as
a
national
problem.
and
so
we
would,
the
federal
government
and
epa
would
be
quite
concerned
about
the
reintroduction
of
attempts
by
the
states
to
as
it
were
try
to
improve
on
that
system.
if
the
states
believe
that
additional
incentives
are
required,
if
certain
states
now
sited
with
land
disposal
facilities
believed
that
certain
incentives
are
required
for
other
states
to
develop
additional
sites
that
would
not
be
redundant,
then
the
proper
course
is
to
take
that
to
congress,
which
can
authorize
through
authorizing
taxes,
even
discriminatory
taxes,
or
other
incentives,
can
take
steps
that
are
necessary
to
make
sure
the
adequate
capacity
is
present.
but
that
has
not
happened
here,
and
alabama
instead
has
tried
to
take
matters
into
its
own
hands
by
adopting
what
it
thinks
is
a
proper
regulation
of
what
is
after
all
interstate
commerce,
by
imposing
a
tax
at
a
level
it
thinks
is
appropriate
to
regulate,
as
it
were,
the
movement
of
goods
from
one
state
to
another.
that's
a
function
that's
assigned
to
congress
under
the
commerce
clause,
not
to
the
states.
and
i
think
that
gets
to
the
reason
why
a
tax
rather
than
a
ban,
even
though
it
may
seem
lesser
included,
doesn't
survive
on
the
quarantine
theory.
it's
because
the
state,
the
state's
interest
is
much
more
indirect.
the
point
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
baldwin
case,
baldwin
v.
seelig,
that
said
if
there
is
a,
if
there
is
the
sort
of
state
interest
that
requires
that
kind
of
immediate
action
it
calls
for
an
immediate
response,
not
the
kind
of
indirect
regulation
that
a
tax
will
do.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
be
subject
to
separate
standards.
first
of
all
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
whether
rcra
would
allow
a
total
ban.
but
if
there
was
a
total
ban
there
would
be
a
question
to
what
extent
that
was
consistent
with
the
state's
interest.
if
the
total
ban
was
premised
on
the
kind
of
imminent
danger,
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
quarantine
cases
have
been
premised
on,
if
the
state
could
make
that
factual
showing,
then
it
might
bring
itself
within
the
quarantine
cases.
the
difference
here
is
that
alabama
is
not
trying
to
regulate
against
imminent
harm.
quite
the
contrary.
most
of
the
harms
that
alabama
cites
in
here
are
ones
that
are
20,
30,
40
years
down
the
road
and
speculative
at
that.
and
in
trying
to
regulate
to
serve
those
purposes
the
state
is
essentially
second
guessing
rcra
and
the
surplus
scheme
that
have
been
set
up
by
congress
to
do
the
best
that
congress
can
on
the
basis
of
current
knowledge
in
the
area
to
guard
against
and
impose
financial
requirements
to
insure
against
long-term
damage
to
local
economies
and
the
local
environment.
so
i
think
that
the,
alabama's
effort
to
bring
this
case
within
the
quarantine
rationale
is
fundamentally
misguided.
in
fact
it's
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
which
answers
this
case.
there
the
court
did
not
disturb
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
the
statute
there
furthered
important
environmental
concerns
and
in
fact
hazardous
wastes
were
embraced
by
the
new
jersey
statute.
but
the
court
said
that
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
new
jersey
statute
was
irrelevant
if
in
furthering
that
purpose
the
state
engaged
in
the
sort
of
discrimination
that
the
commerce
clause
would
otherwise
prohibit.
and
that's
exactly
what
new
jersey
did
in
that
case
by
discriminating
against
out-of-state
commerce.
and
that
is
not
some
new
fangled
notion
that
came
up
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey.
it
goes
back
as
far
as
guy
v.
baltimore,
which
we
quote
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
there
the
court
acknowledged
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
the
labels
or
the
categories
in
which
the
court
has
described
commerce
clause
analysis
has
changed,
but
i
think
that
the
essential
truth
of
what
the
court
has
been
driving
at
in
the
cases
has
really
not
changed.
that
in
the
quarantine
cases,
in
saying
that
a
state
can
impose
a
quarantine
the
court
used
to
say
that
those
are
not
legitimate
items
of
commerce.
i
think
now
the
analysis
would
be
that
a
quarantine
is
valid
if
it's
the
only
measure
that
can
be
taken
to
advance
the
state
interest.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
