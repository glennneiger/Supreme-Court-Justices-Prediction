justice
white
yes,
but
you
could
lose
that
case
and
still
win
this
one.
justice
white
do
you
think
anything
you
have
said
has
suggested
anything
else
than
that
alabama
could
keep
out
all
out-of-state
hazardous
waste?
justice
white
i
don't
know.
i
would
think
it
would
be
easier.
i
think
it
would
be
easier
under
your
rationale.
if
there's
all
this
hazard
that
can
never
be
cured,
why
wouldn't
you
just
keep
them
all
out?
justice
white
well,
why
don't
you
just,
why
don't
you
just
limit
the
amount
of
outside
waste
that
can
come
in?
justice
white
one
of
the
purposes
is
also
to
make
some
money
off
of
outside
waste.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
i
mean--
justice
white
--you
don't
think
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
just
plain
trash?
justice
white
so
you're
going
to
cure
that
just
by
raising
the
price
of
out-of-state
waste?
justice
white
well,
your
in-state
wastes
are
contributing
to
the
whole
problem
too,
aren't
they?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
that
still
doesn't
explain
why
you're
charging
somebody
from
outside
twice
what
you're
charging
inside.
justice
white
does
it?
i
don't--
justice
white
what
do
they
mean
by
sanitary
waste
disposals?
justice
white
do
you
think
that's
an
oxymoron
or
something?
justice
white
just
as
long
as
you
get
paid
enough
you
can
increase
the
risk
to
your
people?
justice
white
well,
what
is
it
then?
you're
getting
paid
for
transferring
the
risk,
and
the
risk
is
being
transferred,
you
say
in
large
volume.
justice
white
well,
all
right.
all
right.
but
here
you
keep
letting
in
the,
you
keep
accepting
this
out-of-state
waste
and
all,
and
the
reason
is,
apparently,
is
that
you,
that
they're
willing
to
pay
the
price
you
charge.
justice
white
well,
that
still
means
that
as
long
as
they
pay
enough
you'll
let
them
transfer
the
risk.
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
so
suppose
you
charge
what
the
traffic
will
bear?
justice
white
from
outside.
you
will
charge
what
the
market
will
bear
and
what
people
from
outside
the
state
are
willing
to
charge,
willing
to
pay.
justice
white
well,
maybe
if
you
charged
a
higher
price
to
your
locals
they
would
be
more
careful
about
generating
solid,
hazardous
waste.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
not
to
$72.
justice
white
well
therefore
i
would
think
they
ought
to...
if
they're
going
to
consistently
and
for
over
the
long-term
contribute
to
this
risk,
they,
why
shouldn't
they
have
to
pay
what
others
do?
justice
white
i
take
it
that,
from
what
you
just
said
that
you
have
some
doubt
about
your
being
able
to
satisfy
the
normal
commerce
clause
test
where
there
is
a
discrimination.
justice
white
do
you
or
do
you
not?
justice
white
so
you
think
you
really
have
to
go
to
another
rationale,
namely
an
expansion
of
the
quarantine
cases?
justice
white
so
your
answer
is
yes.
yes,
you
have
to
go
to
another
rationale
other
than--
justice
white
--you
just
said
you
couldn't
satisfy
the
normal
commerce
clause
test.
justice
white
so
you're
saying
that
you
can
satisfy
the
normal
commerce
clause
test?
justice
white
well,
why
isn't
there
a
non-discriminatory
way
of
controlling
the
volume
of
hazardous
waste
that
you're
willing
to
put
up
with
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
reasons
very
similar
to
those
given
by
justice
stevens
in
the
michigan
trash
case
that
was
just
announced,
we
hold
that
the
alabama
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
which
deals
with
hazardous
waste
is
also
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
hence,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
