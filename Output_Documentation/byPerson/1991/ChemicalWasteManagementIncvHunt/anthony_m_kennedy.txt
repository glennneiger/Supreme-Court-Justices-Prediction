justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
conceding
that
noxious
wastes
of
this
kind
cannot
be
distinguished
from
quarantine
if
a
quarantine
law
is
passed.
i
thought--
justice
kennedy
--is
one
way
to
characterize
that
circumstance
of
the
law
to
say
that
there
is
a
commerce
in
waste,
but
that
there
was
not
a
commerce
in
the
noxious
products
that
were
the
subject
of
the
quarantine
cases?
that's
something
of
a
legal
conclusion,
but--
justice
kennedy
--and
it
seems
to
me
the
quarantine
cases
might
be
distinguishable
on
that
basis.
justice
kennedy
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
existence
of
state
regulation
is
what
controls
whether
there
is
a
commerce
in
waste
or
not.
that's
where
i
don't
follow
you.
justice
kennedy
and
there
was
not
that
finding
in
the
quarantine
cases?
justice
kennedy
so
you're
defending
a
scheme
that's
ineffective?
justice
kennedy
but
if
the
fee
is
so
successful
it
seems
to
me
that
then
everyone
should
have
to
pay
it.
then
you
have
simply
a
blatant
discrimination
with
no
purpose.
justice
kennedy
well,
your
purpose
could
be
precisely
served,
as
you
have
just
demonstrated
it
seems
to
me,
by
having
a
fee
that's
the
same
for
in-state
and
out-of-state.
justice
kennedy
now
we
have
a
simple
commerce
clause
case.
justice
kennedy
--well,
i
can't
think
of
an
interstate
commerce
clause
case
where
the
out-of-state
burden
was
greater
than
the
in-state
burden
just
by
share
of
numbers.
justice
kennedy
you'd
have
to
talk
about
trucking,
traffic,
whatever
it
is.
it's
always
the
out-of-state
that
causes
the
problem.
but
the
point
is
you
can't
discriminate.
justice
kennedy
i
thought
we
overruled
such
reciprocal
arrangements
in
the
katrell
case.
justice
kennedy
you
say
police
power.
i
can't
think
of
anything
that
isn't
the
police
power.
everything
is
the
police
power.
justice
kennedy
i
can't
think
of
any
law
that's
not
for
the
health,
safety,
and
welfare
of
the
people.
it's
a
question
of
degree.
