mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
alabama's
waste
disposal
tax,
which
is
levied
only
on
waste
generated
outside
that
state,
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
petitioner
chemical
waste
management
operates,
owns
and
operates
a
hazardous
waste
disposal
facility
near
emelle,
alabama.
this
facility
is
authorized
to
operate
under
both
federal
and
state
law,
and
virtually
every
aspect
of
its
operations
are
closely
regulated
by
both
the
federal
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
alabama
department
of
environmental
management.
that
regulation
is
designed
to
minimize
to
the
greatest
degree
possible
any
threat
to
public
health
and
the
environment.
the
statute
challenged
in
this
case
levies
a
$72
per
ton
tax
on
waste
disposed
of
at
the
emelle
facility
that
is
generated
outside
alabama.
waste
generated
within
alabama
is
not
subject
to
the
tax.
the
trial
court
declared
this
statute
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause
on
the
ground
that
it
impermissibly
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
the
alabama
supreme
court
disagreed,
holding
that
because
the
overall
purpose
of
the
tax
was
to
protect
public
health
and
the
environment,
the
commerce
clause's
antidiscrimination
principle
did
not
apply.
we
submit
that
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
provision
is
clear
under
long-settled
commerce
clause
principles.
a
law
that
discriminates
on
its
face
against
interstate
commerce
violates
the
commerce
clause
unless
it
advances
a
legitimate
local
purpose
that
cannot
be
adequately
served
by
reasonable
non-discriminatory
alternatives.
the
court
has
never
found
this
test
satisfied
by
a
discrimination
tax,
save
in
one
circumstance
where
the
tax
in
fact
is
not
economically
discriminatory
because
it
precisely
compensates
for
an
identical
levy
that
is
limited
to
in-state
commerce.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
there
were
no
federal
legislation--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--at
all,
then
that
would
come
very
close
to
resembling
the
kinds
of
statutes
that
this
court
upheld
in
the
quarantine
cases.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
of
course,
as
your
question
points
out,
there
are
two
distinctions
here.
one,
this
is
not
a
quarantine.
it's
a
tax.
and
two,
there
is
the
federal
legislation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
not,
justice
o'connor,
because
we
think
the
local
purposes
underlying
those
two
types
of
statutes
are
very
different.
in
the
quarantine
cases
the
local
interest
that
the
court
identified
was
an
interest
in
preventing
any
additional
items
of
the
particular
good
into
the
state
at
all.
the
state's
interest
was
in
reducing
it
to
the
minimum
degree
possible.
here
that
is
not
alabama's
interest.
that's
not
what
the
statute
does,
and
in
fact
that's
not
the
interest
that
respondents
assert
in
their
brief.
here
they
assert
that
alabama's
health
and
safety
interest
is
in
reducing
volumes,
keeping
volume
to
some,
what
they
regard
as
an
acceptable
level.
and
if
volume
is
the
question,
then
there
is
no,
the
out-of,
the
state
of
origin
makes
no
difference.
if
they're
willing
to
have
600,000
tons,
or
whatever
the
volume
is,
then
that
volume,
wherever
it
comes
from,
the
risk
will
be
the
same
and
they
have
no
interest
in
discriminating.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
again,
justice
scalia,
that's
not
the
interest
that's
underlying
their
statute.
i
mean,
that's
really
two
interests.
one
is
an
interest
in
reducing
volumes,
and
the
other
is
an
interest
in
insuring
that
alabama
generators
are
completely
taken
care
of
and
then
leaving
something
over
for
the
rest
of
the
generators
in
the
country.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
know
they
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
they're
not
taking
care
of
it.
chemical
waste
management
is.
if
they
decided
to
make
the
investments
and
construct
and
own
and
operate
a
hazardous
waste
disposal
facility,
make
the
technological
investments,
hire
the
people,
the
market
participant
doctrine
that
this
court
has
recognized
would
allow
them
to
discriminate.
but
that's
not
what
they're
doing
here.
they're
saying
even
though
you're
a
private
entity
we
want
you
to
take
care
of
alabama's
problem
and
we
don't
want
you
to
be
accessible,
except
to
some
very
limited
degree,
to
the
rest
of
the
national
economy.
and
that
they
can't
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
emelle
is
located
on
the
border
with
mississippi,
sort
of
toward
the
middle
of
the
state.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
that
the
question
whether
this,
the
interest
that
alabama
asserts
here
are
sufficient
to
justify
upholding
the
first
discriminatory
tax
outside
of
the
compensating
tax
area
is
answered
by
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
philadelphia,
and
the
answer
is
no.
the
court
held
in
city
of
philadelphia
that
new
jersey
could
not
ban
the
disposal
of
out-of-state
waste
because
there
was
no--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
new
jersey's,
the
rationale
that
new
jersey
relied
upon
was
precisely
the
same
protection
of
the
public
health
and
the
environment
that
alabama
is
relying
on
here,
and
the
court
expressly
said
we're
not
saying
that
new
jersey
is
wrong
about
the
fact
that
the
statute
will
protect
that
interest.
we're
just
saying
that
there's
no
reason,
that
interest
doesn't
justify
the
discrimination.
and
in
fact
that
statute,
excuse
me,
did
cover
all
kinds
of
solid
waste.
and
the
court's
opinion--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
the
court
did
not,
did
not
go
off
on
some
kind
of
level
of
hazard.
it
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
its
decision
that
new
jersey
had
a
legitimate
public
health
interest
and
just
said
it
could
not
promote
that
interest
in
this
discriminatory
way
because
there
were
less
discriminatory
means
available
to
it.
and
we
think
that's
precisely
true
of
the
situation
here.
alabama
has
less
discriminatory
means.
it
can
impose
a
reasonable
even-handed
cap.
it
can
say
you
can
only
dispose
of
x
hundred
thousand
tons,
whatever
level
they
are
comfortable
with,
providing
it
means
other,
whatever
other
applicable
constitutional
and
statutory
requirements
there
are,
or
they
can
impose
an
even-handed
tax.
they
just--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--alabama
could
try
and
enact
an
entirely
different
statute
that
did
regulate
transportation,
and
then
we'd
have
to
see
precisely
what
it
did,
whether--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--may
be
disposed
of
there?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
we
think
that
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
very
reasons
we
are
urging
here.
that
statute
doesn't
regulate
transportation.
waste
could
be
transported
anywhere,
into,
out
of,
through
alabama.
that
would
just
regulate,
that
would
be
a
disposal
regulation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
could
certainly
lose
that
case,
justice
white,
and
still
win
this
one
because
alabama
has
not
done
that,
and
it
hasn't
purported
to
do
anything
about
transportation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all
i
should
say
preliminarily
that
alabama
does
not
rely
on
any
congressional
authorization
here.
it
didn't
preserve
those
arguments
below.
they
were
never
raised
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
we...
let
me
just,
i'm
sorry...
in
addition
to
the
procedural
problem,
we
don't
think
congress
has
authorized
discrimination
here.
this
court's
precedents
make
clear
that
congressional
authorization
must
be
unambiguous,
and
there's
just
nothing
in
these
statutes
that
are
pointed
to
by
the
amici
that
constitutes
unambiguous
authorization.
one
provision
is
a
savings
clause
similar
to
the
one
that
the
court
found
insufficient
in
wyoming
against
oklahoma
and
a
number
of
other
cases.
the
other
is
a
statute
that
authorizes
epa
to
review
state
programs,
and
if
it
finds
them
consistent
with
the
federal
program,
authorize
the
states
to,
epa
will
withdraw
and
essentially
the
states
will
be
the
hazardous
waste
regulator
in
the
state.
now,
that
says,
that's
a
limitation
on
state
authority
because
what
that
statute
says
is
that
state
regulation
must
be
consistent
with
the
federal
scheme.
and
it's
in
implementing
that
statutory
mandate
that
epa
reviewed
the
south
carolina
discriminatory
tax
and
found
that
it
did
not
violate
the
consistency
requirement.
now,
epa,
as
i
say
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
regulation
don't
give
south
carolina
the
authority
to
discriminate.
second
of
all,
epa
did
not
purport
to
be
applying
the
commerce
clause.
it
purported
to
be
applying
a
completely
different
requirement
that
may
or
may
not
be
overlapping.
we
think
that
the
way
the
schemes
fit
together
is
clear.
the
commerce
clause
exists
as
a
free-standing
limit
on
state
authority,
and
epa
has
apparently
determined,
or
at
least
in
that
case
determined
that
something
that
might,
that
whether
or
not
something
violated
the
commerce
clause
was
irrelevant
for
its
decision
whether
the
state
program
was
consistent.
but
we
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
commerce
clause
challenge
we
have
brought
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical
is
that
it's
focusing
on
the
state
as
the
market.
and
what
the
commerce
clause,
what
the
framers
decided
is
that
the
nation
is
the
economic
market,
and
alabama
can't
set
up--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--in
think
your
cases
say
that
if
there
was
a
quarantine
statute,
a
flat
ban
on
any
importation,
and
if
the
state
proves
the
kind
of
danger
that
was
established
in
those
cases,
that
those
kinds
of
statutes
will
be
upheld.
not
because
there
is
some
dangerous
items
exception
to
the
commerce
clause,
but
because
in
that
particular
situation
that's
the
least
discriminatory
means
effectuating
a
particular
state
interest.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
you
cannot
take
account
of
it
in...
if
the
state
doesn't
have
that
interest,
then
it's
not
entitled
to
discriminate
because
it's
interest
is
by
definition
less.
i
mean,
we're
just
looking
at
what's
the
state's
interest
here.
alabama
has
said
we're
willing
to
tolerate
x
tons.
now,
it
also
says
we'd
really
like,
we
want
this
facility
to
take
care
of
all
alabama
people
first,
to
put
them
first
in
line
essentially.
but
that
kind
of
argument
would
sweep
much
too
broadly,
as
we
set
out
some
hypotheticals
in
our
brief,
if
that
were
true.
this
court's
decision
in
the
new
england
power
case
that
there
could
be
discrimination
because
it
would
be
nice
for
the
low
cost
energy
that
was
generated
by
hydroelectric
plants
within
the
state
to
be
accessible
to
the
state
residents
should
have
come
out
differently.
the
state
held
that
wasn't
a
legitimate
state
interest
because
the
state
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
discriminating,
essentially,
and
that's
the
interest
that
alabama
is
asserting
here.
it
sort
of,
the
very
interest
is
inconsistent
with
what
underlies
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
alabama--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
alabama
had
enacted
a
quarantine
statute
which
indicated
that
that
was
its
interest,
and
if
it
showed
that
in
fact
allowing
additional
items
such
as
this
into
the
state,
yes,
then
i
think
we'd
lose.
but
as
i
said
earlier,
we
think
that
they
haven't
done
either.
they
haven't
enacted
a
quarantine
statute.
they
haven't
said
that
that's
their
interest.
they
have
said
their
interest
is
in
limiting
volumes.
they
said
that
would
take
care
of
the
public
health
risks
that
they
see.
and
we
think
that
if
that's
their
interest
there
is
a
non-discriminatory
way
to
do
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
should
say
in
this
context
i'm
not
sure
that
even
if
they
adopted
the
all,
the
quarantine,
that
they
could
meet
the
standard
for
establishing
that
there
is
the
threat
of
imminent
massive
danger
that
was
present
in
the
quarantine
cases
because
there
is
a
very,
very
comprehensive
federal
and
state
regulatory
scheme
here.
the
federal
statute
defines
these
substances
as
hazardous
if
they
are
not
properly
managed.
but
they
are
properly
managed.
there
is
a
management
scheme
in
place.
in
the
quarantine
cases
what
the
states
were
saying
is
there
was
no
intermediate
regulatory
scheme
that
limited
the
hazards
that
were
posed
by
the
weevils
or
the
infected
cows.
the
question
was
can
we
keep
them
out.
here
we
have
a
regulatory
scheme--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
was
just
saying
is
i
think
this
case
is
different
because
these
regulatory
schemes
are
in
place,
and
i
think
alabama
would
have
difficulty
making
a
showing
of
uncontrollable
danger
that
was,
that
the
states
had
to
make
in
those
cases
to
justify
their
quarantines
precisely
because
there
is
here
a
regulatory
scheme
that
covers
transportation,
every
facet
of
these
wastes'
handling
and
disposal
is
covered
in
a
way
that
very,
very
significantly
lessens
the
danger.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
many
of
the
quarantine
cases
do
state
that
those
items
are
not
items
of
commerce
because
they
are
so
objectionable,
because
they
threaten
the
state,
the
very
existence
of
life
and
the
environment
within
the
state,
and
we
don't
think...
and
therefore
the
legal
conclusion
was
they
are
not
commerce,
and
because
of
the
state
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
at
the
time
the
state
can
regulate
them.
here
we
think
we
fit
within
that
paradigm,
although
the
court's
jurisprudence
has
moved
away
so
it's
not
necessary
to
hold
that
these
things,
whether...
the
court
has
concluded
that
everything
is
commerce
because
it
hasn't
found
the
states--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
those
items
were
found
to
be
noxious
and
poses
uncontrollable
risk,
and
the
federal
scheme
eliminates
to
a
large
part
that
risk.
we
don't...
maybe
not
entirely,
maybe
there's
some
risk,
just
as
there's
a
risk
of
flying,
when
you
get
into
a
plane
federal
regulation--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
there
is,
there
certainly
is
a
business
in
waste
and
in
the
transportation
and
disposal--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
certainly
was
not,
your
honor,
and
that
is
an
important
distinction
also.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
diseased
cattle
would
be
an
item
of
commerce,
and
i
think
that
follows
exactly
from
what
the
court
said
in
city
of
philadelphia
where
it
says
everything
is
an
item
of
commerce.
it
would
not
necessarily...
the
ability
of
the
state
to
regulate
would
turn
on
whether
it
could
show
that
its
regulation
advanced
the
legitimate
local
purpose
that
could
not
be
satisfied
by
reasonable
non-discriminatory
means.
and
it
may
be
for
diseased
cows
the
state
could
show
that
the
only
way
for
it
to
protect
itself
was
to
impose
an
import
ban,
and
so
therefore
the
ban
could
be
upheld.
here
there
is
no
import--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it's
exactly
the
same
test.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
the
reliance
on
volumes
from
out-of-state
is
a
complete
red
herring.
this
is
a
per
ton
tax.
if
there
are
greater
volumes
from
out-of-state,
out-of-staters
will
pay
more
because
the
tax
is
imposed
on
every
ton.
second
of
all,
respondents
argue
again
that
they're
being
responsible
in
taking
care
of
their
own.
on
that
theory
a
state
should
be
able
to
restrict
access
to
hospitals
within
the
state
to
its
own
citizens
because
it
would
prefer
to
take
care
of
its
own
health
problem
and
other
states
should
take
care
of
all.
that
argument
has
been
consistently
rejected
in
city
of
philadelphia
and
all
of
this
court's
commerce
clause
cases.
basically
the
claim
here
is
that
the
national
solution,
the
national
process
hasn't
worked.
then
alabama
can
go
to
congress
and
pass,
get
relief
the
way
that
the
states
with
nuclear
disposal
sites
did
and
got
the
low
level
radioactive
waste
act
passed.
finally,
this
compensation
argument
that
the
amount
of
the
tax
can
be
balanced
against
risks
is
again
totally
baseless
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
if
that
were
right,
a
state
that
had
a
manufacturing
facility
could
impose
an
export
tax
on
the
theory
that
its
residents
bore
the
burdens
of
air
and
water
pollution,
but
the
out-of-staters
didn't,
so
that
it
shouldn't,
its
residents
shouldn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
but
the
out-of-staters
should.
that
would
destroy
the
national
union
that
the
framers
wanted
and
lead
each
state
to
impose
these
disparate
economic
burdens
in
order
to
achieve
some
rough
parity,
and
that's
not
what
the
commerce
clause
is
about.
thank
you,
your
honor.
