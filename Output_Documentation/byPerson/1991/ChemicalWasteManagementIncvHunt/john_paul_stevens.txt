justice
stevens
but
mr.
nettles,
isn't
it
true
that
you
do
have
a
cap
on
the
amount
of
waste
that,
altogether?
justice
stevens
well,
why
do
you
need
an
additional
means
to
bring
it
down?
justice
stevens
is
that
your
limit,
the
250,000
tons?
justice
stevens
but
the
cap
doesn't
differentiate
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
waste?
justice
stevens
so
if
you've
got
a
cap
that
apparently
you
can
handle,
why
then
do
you
have
to
charge
some
waste
more
than
others?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
does
the
cap
keep
it
from,
i
mean,
does
the
additional,
the
$72
tax
make
it
less
than
the
cap,
or
just
another
way
is
making
sure
nobody
violates
the
cap?
justice
stevens
but
you
can't
put
in
more
than
the
cap,
can
you?
justice
stevens
but
you're
going
to
have
that
250,000
tons
no
matter
whether
you've
got
this
tax
or
not.
justice
stevens
do
you
ship
any
hazardous
waste
out
of
the
state
yourselves?
justice
stevens
if
they
prohibited
that,
that
texas
wouldn't
take
that.
justice
stevens
you've
asked
about
the
chicago
river,
do
you
suppose
it
would
have
helped
if
they
had
tried
to
keep
the
wisconsin
water
out
of
the
river
and
the
michigan
water
and
just
let
illinois
water
up
the
river?
i
don't
understand
the
analogy.
i
really
don't.
justice
stevens
sure,
but
you've
got
a
control
on
the
volume
here.
justice
stevens
but
those
findings
that
detail,
and
they
are
detailed
in
the
legislature
and
in
the
trial
court,
do
not
indicate,
unlike
the
maine
against,
the
maine
case
with
the
fish
inspection,
that
there's
any
difference
at
all
between
the
out-of-state
waste
and
the
locally
generated
waste
in
terms
of
the
hazard.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
no,
but
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
if
we
just
apply
the
laws
of
economics,
if
you
raise
the
tax
to
your
locals
to
$72
a
ton,
or
whatever
it
is,
you
would
have
less
waste
generated
in
alabama?
wouldn't
that
be
a
desirable
thing
to
have
happen?
