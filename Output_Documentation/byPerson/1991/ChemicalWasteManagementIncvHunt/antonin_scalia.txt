justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
follows.
it
seems
to
me
rather
cruel
to
say
that
the
less
solicitous
of
her
sister
states
alabama
is,
the
more
we're
going
to
punish
her.
i
mean,
instead
of
saying
we're
not
going
to
allow
any
states
to
dump
anything
here,
they're
saying
well,
you
know,
there
may
be
some
of
our
sister
states
that
have
real
problems,
and
if
they're
really,
you
know,
if
it's
that
serious
that
they're
willing
to
pay
this
amount
per
ton
we'll
let
them
do
it.
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
solution?
and
it
could
be
based
on
the
same
desire
not
to
have
any
of
this
noxious
material
within
alabama.
justice
scalia
oh,
but
they
do
want
alabama
generators
totally
taken
care
of.
justice
scalia
of
course,
because
they're
a
responsible
state.
they
don't
want
to
dump
this
on
other
states.
the
same
solicitude
for
their
sister
states
that
causes
them
to
set
a
high
fee
for
stuff
from
other
states
but
not
to
ban
it
entirely,
causes
them
to
say
we'll
take
care
of
our
own
waste.
that's
the
kind
of
state
we
are.
why
isn't
that
thoroughly
admirable?
justice
scalia
mr.
pincus,
suppose
it
could
be
shown
that
what
alabama
had
in
mind
was
it
wanted
to
be
sure
that
there
were
private
facilities
available
within
alabama
to
dispose
of
dangerous
materials
in
alabama,
which
is
certainly
a
substantial
state
interest.
so
it
allowed
alabama
residents
to
dispose
of
them
at
private
facilities.
it
also
found
that
these
facilities
would
not
be
cost
efficient,
could
not
be
supported
without
accepting
some
out-of-state
waste.
so
they
put,
they
adopted
the
statute
they
have
here.
you
can
bring
it
from
out-of-state
but
you
have
to
pay
a
lot
more.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
reasonable,
thoroughly
reasonable
state
scheme
based
upon
the
state's
interest
in
disposing
of
dangerous
materials
and
keeping
out
as
much
dangerous
material
as
possible,
consistent
with
managing
their
own
wastes?
justice
scalia
not
for
dangerous
goods.
the
states
can
be
the
markets
for
dangerous
goods.
can't
they?
haven't,
don't
our
cases
say
that,
that
they
can
keep
out
dangerous
materials
from
other
states?
justice
scalia
all
or
nothing
at
all.
you
have
to
keep
it
out
entirely
or
else
you
can't
take
any
account
of
the
dangerousness.
justice
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
diseased
cattle.
to
allow
in-state
ranches
to
have
diseased
cattle,
but
not
to
allow
any
out-of-state
ranches
to
ship
diseased
cattle
into
the
state
is,
you
know...
it's
the
same
thing.
it
does
discriminate
in
favor
of
in-state
people
in
a
way.
justice
scalia
you
wouldn't
allow
a
total
ban
either,
i
gather
from
what
you
said
before.
justice
scalia
mr.
nettles--
justice
scalia
--it's
a
very
sensible
way
to
allocate
the
limited
portion
of
your
landfill
that
you
want
to
go
to
out-of-state
hazardous
waste
to
use
the
rationing
mechanism
of
price.
it
has
been
found
to
be
very
efficient,
and
indeed
the
out-of-state
people
who
most
need
it
would
use
it
if
you
use
a
high
price.
unfortunately
that
rationing
mechanism
runs
a
real
risk
of
being
abused,
and
maybe
we
should
adopt
a
commerce
clause
principle
that
if
you
wanted
to
exclude
it
entirely,
that's
okay,
or
even
if
you
wanted
to
place
a
certain
tonnage
limit
on
out-of-state,
that
might
be
okay.
but
here
you've
used
price,
and
as
far
as
we
know
you
may
just
be
doing
this
just
to
milk
out-of-staters,
just
as
has
been
done
in
other
commerce
clause
cases.
justice
scalia
all
we
know
for
sure
is
that
you're
making
a
lot
of
money
on
it
and
imposing
substantial
costs
on
out-of-state
industries
which
your
own
industries
don't
have
to
bear.
we
know
that
for
sure.
whether
it's
going
to
reduce
volume
or
not,
you
know,
it
may
a
little
bit.
