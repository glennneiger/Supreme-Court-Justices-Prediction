chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-471,
chemical
waste
management,
inc.
v.
guy
hunt,
governor
of
alabama.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
pincus,
where
abouts
in
alabama
is
emelle?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
you
didn't
have
the
hazardous
waste
problem,
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the,
what
was
actually
being
transported
was
simply
garbage,
which
i
suppose
has
some
dangers
inherent,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
the
same
as
the
hazardous
waste.
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
alabama
impose
a
requirement
that
provided
for
the
least
possible
transportation
of
that
stuff
within
alabama?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
it
said
only
hazardous
waste
generated
within
100
miles
of
the
emelle
facility
can
be
brought
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
may
be
disposed
of
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if
someone
wants
to
go
into
the
business
of
shipping
diseased
cattle
from
one
state
to
another,
does
that
diseased
cow
become
an
item
of
commerce?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
the
same
test
in
any
event
as--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
agree
with
mr.
pincus
then
that
the
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
has
changed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
nettles,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
mr.
nettles,
i
think
justice
stevens
asked
you
wasn't
there
a
finding
that
there
was
no
difference
in
toxicity
as
between
local
waste
and...
or
did
the
court
not
find
any
difference
in
toxicity
between
local
waste
and
out-of-state
waste.
that's
a
question
that
could
be
answered
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nettles.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-471,
chemical
waste
management
versus
hunt
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
