mr.
bert
s.
nettles
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
modern
commerce
clause
concepts
have
never
been
previously
confronted
in
this
court
with
a
hazardous
waste
police
power
control
case,
and
as
we
consider
that
i
would
suggest
there
are
three
key
factors
in
this
case
to
consider.
one,
that
hazardous
wastes
are
inherently
dangerous
to
human
safety
and
to
the
environment
and
to
the
health.
there
is
just
simply
no
safe
way
to
permanently
landfill
hazardous
waste,
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
full
of
documentation
on
that
issue.
now,
as
such,
considering
the
imminent
and
the
inherent
dangers
and
also
the
fact
there
is
no
safe
way
to
permanently
landfill
hazardous
waste,
do
the
commerce
clause,
the
typical
commerce
clause
protections
inure
to
toxic
items
of
this
type?
second
factor,
at
the
very
least
the
unique
problems
of
hazardous
waste
and
the
landfilling
of
hazardous
waste
should
be
considered
if
the
alabama
statute
is
subjected
to
the
usual
balancing
test
or
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
and
the
third
factor
we
would
submit
is
that
the
national
interest
would
be
better
served
by
upholding
alabama's
differential
fee.
and
i--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--your
honor,
that
would
be
a
more
serious
test.
i
think
a
ban
under
these
facts--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--your
honor,
this
is
a
modified
type
commerce
clause
case.
it's
the
volumes.
it's
the
volumes
of
the
hazardous
waste
that
present
the
problem.
one
barrel
of
outside
hazardous
waste
doesn't
contain
germs
that
are
going
to
set
off
an
epidemic,
but
when
you
get
to
40,000
truck
loads
in
one
year,
as
in
1989,
85
to
90
percent
of
that
from
out-of-state,
being
permanently
buried--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--well,
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
the
primary
purpose
was
to
reduce
this.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
your
honor,
we
would--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--that's
one
of
the
factors.
reduce
the
volumes,
control
under
alabama's
inherent
police
power
tradition,
and
number
two,
compensation
for
the
burdens
that
are
being
transferred
from
north
carolina,
from
other
exporting
states,
most
of
the
states
in
the
country,
some
48
other
states,
that
transfer
of
risk
that
they
are
sending
into
alabama,
to
ask
them
to
share
in
the
burden.
and
that--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
that's
the
difference
in
this
and
the
city
of
philadelphia
case.
i
would
cite
one
instance,
the
question
has
been
raised
as
to
possible
preemption
and
the
city
of
philadelphia
case
did
hold
that
they,
the
court
agreed
with
the
new
jersey
court
that
the
state
law
had
not
been
preempted
by
the
federal
law,
which
in
that
case
was
rcra.
that
state
law,
the
traditional
police
power
concept,
still
has
room
to
operate.
to
give
an
illustration
as
to
the
volume
problem
we
have
in
alabama,
consider
the
chicago
flooding.
the
question
would
be
would
the
chicago
river
have
burst
through
the
retaining
wall
had
only
11
percent
of
the
volume
been
in
the
chicago
river
rather
than
the
full
100
percent.
see,
this
is
the
problem
that
alabama
has.
it
does
have
an
imminent
and
present
threat,
whether
we
have
a
tornado
that
may
swoop
down
in
these
open
trenches
tomorrow
or
an
earthquake.
we
have
there
these
millions
of
tons
of
hazardous
waste
already
in
place
and
they're
going
to
be
there
forever,
and
that's
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
that
differs
from
the
typical
quarantine
case.
and
that's
why
alabama
has
approached
this
in
a
way
of
trying
to
be
a
responsible
market
player,
but
trying
to
address
the
tremendously
increasing
volumes
that
may
in
themselves
have
changed
the
very
nature
of
the
risk,
as
in
the
chicago
flooding
case,
because--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--and
that
is
done
under
a
base
fee.
and
it's
interesting
and
reflective
of
alabama's
problem
to
address
this
across
the
board,
that
the
same
statute
now
under
attack
raised
the
base
fee
that
applies
to
all
in-state
interest
and
the
results
of
that
in
the
18
months
of
operation,
17.5
months,
is
that
the
ratio
of
out-of-state
waste
to
in-state
waste
has
actually
slightly
increased,
going
from
an
average
of
85
to
90
percent
to
89
percent
hazardous
waste
still
coming
in
from
out-of-state.
we're
still
dealing
with
tremendous
volumes.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
no,
sir.
the
effect
of
it
has
been
to
reduce
the
volumes,
to
reduce
the
volumes
of
hazardous
waste
coming
in
at
a
staggering
proportion,
almost
800,000
tons
that
had
been
increased
over
200
percent
in
the
years,
immediate
years
preceding
this.
and
the
second
is
to
compensate
alabama
for
the
total
problems
that
would
result
from
both
the
short
range,
financial
problems,
of
health,
safety
concerns,
and
regulating,
and
in
monitoring,
and
in
the
eventual
remediation,
clean
up,
and
abatement
that
will
be
involved.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
well,
the
purpose
we
have--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--well,
the
purpose
there--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--but,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
this
is
a
police
power
case
in
the
sense
that
alabama
is
one
of
a
handful
of
states
that
happen
to
have
a
hazardous
waste
landfill
in
operation
at
the
time
of
rcra,
and
that
since
rcra
was
adopted
and
since
the
amendments
to
rcra
in
1980
there
have
been
no
further
hazardous
waste
facilities
with
one
exception
permitted.
the
difficulty
is
because
the
national
scheme
has
failed,
and
we
are
told
simply
do,
sit
back
and
do
nothing,
because
epa
has
done
nothing
and
they
talk
about,
the
epa
problems
have
been
addressed
and
of
course
the
general
accounting
office
manual
of
june
1980,
the
report
to
congress
on
the
hazardous
waste
long-term
problems
that
epa
had
not
addressed.
and
the
record
itself
contains
complete
documented
findings
of
the
trial
court
as
affirmed
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
these
problems
are
already
very
real,
not
just
the
threats,
but
there
is
the
imminent
danger
already
resulting
from
leakage.
the
facility
there
is
already
leaking
into
the
settlement
chalk.
and
this
was
a
finding
of
the
trial
judge
in
stating
that
that
was
the
apparent
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
found
that
to
be
the
case.
and
in
this--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--by
reducing
the
volumes.
what
we're
doing
there
is
addressing
what
we
fear
to
be
the
change
in
the
very
nature
of
the
risk,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
out-of-state
waste
from
in-state
waste,
the
tremendous
volumes
coming
in
from
outside.
because
this
could
be,
we
fear,
a
synergistic
or
compounding
effect.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
but
to
a
much
lesser
extent,
and
this,
alabama's--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--what
we're
doing
is
attempting
to
approach--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--approach
this
on
a
balancing
bit.
we
are
not
saying
we
are
going
to
isolate
ourselves
from
the
national
problem.
we're
not
attempting
a
total
ban.
what
we
have
done
is
saying
we
want
to
be
a
responsible
player,
but
one
thing
we
want
to
take
less
of
this
short
and
long-term
risk
by
controlling
the
volumes,
and
we
have
substantially
reduced
the
volumes
although
they
are
still
coming
in
at
over
250,000
tons
a
year.
and
the
second
is
to
compensate
us.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
your
honor--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--that's
the
uniqueness
of
this
case,
we
submit.
this
is
a
police
power
case.
this
is
a
modified
quarantine
case.
it's
an
extension
of
maine
v.
taylor
in
the
sense
that
a
total
ban
alabama
felt
was
not
appropriate
or
possibly
not
necessary,
possibly
alabama
felt
could
not
be
as
well
defended
as
addressing
a
more
balanced
reasonable
approach
not
removing
us
from
the
market.
now,
the
city
of
philadelphia
situation
was
quite
different.
not
only
do
we
have
hazardous
waste
here
and
the
inherent
nature
and
problem
of
the
problem
of
hazardous
waste,
we
also
did
not
have
a
total
ban.
there
is,
we
submit,
the
record
shows
that
this
is
not
an
economic
protection
case
in
the
sense
that
we
are
still
allowing
hazardous
waste
to
come
in.
what
we
have,
too,
is
the
fact
that
there
can
be,
we
fear,
a
distinguishing
factor
with
respect
to
the
amounts
that,
the
volumes
that
alabama
in
its
findings
of
fact
in
the
legislative
pronouncement,
the
trial
court
having
held
that
these
legislative
findings
of
fact
were
substantiated
by
the
evidence,
that
these
findings
substantiate
the
concern
of
volumes
changing
the
very
nature
of
the
risk.
and
you
have
this
intersection
of
police
power
with
commerce
clause
cases.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
yes,
sir.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
but
no
hazardous
waste
situation,
your
honor,
no
record
in
any
of
those
tax
cases
or
highway
transportation
cases,
any
that
approach
the
concern
or
even
talk
about
police
power
considerations
that
are
involved
here
with
the
protection
of
health
and
safety
and
the
environment.
and
that
this--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--but
alabama
industries
are
there.
they're
going
to
be
there
for
the
eventual
abatement,
remediation,
and
clean
up.
they'll
be
there
if
the
disaster
strikes
in
the
interim,
if
there
is
a
further
earthquake,
if
there
is
a
tornado.
and
the
justice
department
says
well,
these
are
threats.
well,
threats
alone
can
be
sufficient
to
and
are
held
to
be
sufficient
to
warrant
police
power
protection
of
state
law
as
evidenced
in
maine
v.
taylor
and
also
in
reid
v.
colorado,
the
case
cited
by
the
petitioner.
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
not
only
the
threat
but
also
the
very
real
present
problems.
we've
got
a
national
situation
that
hasn't
worked.
there
is
no
effort
being
made
by
epa
to
get
other
facilities
to
be
brought
on-line.
there
has
been
talk
in
the
brief
about
the
nimby
syndrome,
the
not
in
my
backyard
syndrome.
that's
what
alabama
has
been
fighting.
and
the
problem
here
is
the
fact
that
under
the
present
plan
that
if
this
type
of
situation,
the
position
of
the
justice
department
and
epa
and
petitioner
are
upheld,
then
any
state
looking
at
the
problem
rather
than
going
forward
and
trying
to
take
a
responsible
position
and
permitting,
allowing
the
citing
of
a
hazardous
waste
facility
within
their
own
state
would
think
again,
because
to
do
so
you
would
lose
control.
you
would
have
again
the
threat
of
out-of-state
swamping
wherever
it's
located,
whether
in
maine
or
north
carolina
or
any
of
these
other
states.
but
to
approve
the
concept,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about
here,
the
amount
of
the
fee
has
never
been
challenged
in
the
courts
below.
it's
just
the
concept
that
we
can't
do
anything
differently
with
respect
to
out-of-state
waste.
and
because
of
that
we
have
the
very
real
problem
that
there
is
no
relief
in
sight,
and
if
we
did
nothing,
no
matter
what
we
did
whether
it
was
a
ban
or--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--yes,
sir.
and
that
has
helped
bring
down
the
volumes,
but
it
still
doesn't--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--because
of
the
fact
that
we
still
have
the
volume
of
over
250,000
tons
of
out-of-state
hazardous
waste
coming
in.
ideally--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--no.
yes,
sir,
it's
closer
to
300,000
tons
across
the
board.
it's
interesting
again
that
the--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
because
the
problem
is
still
there.
eventually
it's
going
to
leave.
now,
that
has
been
the
finding
of
all
the--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--the
more
waste
you
put
into
that
river
of
toxins
there
at
emelle--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--no,
sir,
but
you
still
have,
even
with
the
cap
in
place,
that's
left
us
with
250,
more
than
250,000
tons
of
out-of-state
waste
coming
in.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
and
the
point
is
then
you
look
at
the
compensatory
nature
of
it,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
transfer
of
risk,
of
actual
risk
from
out-of-state
into
alabama
of
very
dangerous
toxins
that
are
involved
in
this,
unlike
anything
else.
it's
a
very
unique
situation.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
yes,
sir.
and
we
would
have
no
problem
with
the
concept--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--we
would
have
no
problem
with
the
fact
that
other
states
who
accommodate
our
waste
water
situation,
we
have
an
agreement
set
up
that
they
charge
a
differential
fee
to
accommodate
alabama
in
that
respect,
just
as
we
are
accommodating
other
states
who
are
transferring
their
problems
to
us.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
but
that,
your
honor,
we
submit
was
not
a
police
power
hazardous
waste
case.
again,
this
is
a
very--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--not
where
the
health
and
safety
and
welfare
of
the
people
are
involved
and
environmental
concerns.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
well,
the
degree
here
is
certainly
accentuated
and
it
is
set
out
in
the
record
that
we
have
here
the
documentation
not
only
of
the
trial
in
alabama,
4-day
trial
and
the
depositions
that
went
on
before
then,
but
we
have
the
general
accounting
office's
own
report
that
shows
that
there
is
just
no
long
range
planning
by
epa,
has
been
none
to
plan
beyond
30
years.
and
yet
everybody
concedes
that
landfilling
is
totally
undesirable.
it's
the
least
desirable
form
of
disposing
of
hazardous
wastes
because
it's
going
to
be
with
us
forever
and
there
is
just
no
way
to
keep
it
from
leaking.
the
problem
again
is
the
volumes,
where
you
have
these
large
volumes
of
out-of-state
hazardous
waste
coming
in
and
have
been
coming
in
and
are
continuing
to
come
in.
then
the
threat
is
that
that
changes
the
very
nature
of
the
risk,
just
as
again
the
chicago
river
situation.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
your
honor--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--yes.
there's
just
no
way
you
can
do
it,
and
that's
the
finding
of
the
general
accounting
office.
that's
the
testimony.
this
stuff
is
already
out
there.
the
debate
in
the
trial
court
was
how
long
will
it
take
before
it
leaks
out
into
the
groundwater,
before
it
leaks
out
into
the
surface
water,
and
the
debate,
during
that
debate
it
was
brought
out
that
there
are
unmapped
faults
and
fractures
in
the
settlement
chalk.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
the
volumes
there.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
but
it's
not
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
to
say
that
those
volume
controls
of
the
cap
will
cure
the
problems.
they
don't.
we
have
the
facility
there
for,
obviously
it
was
there
before.
we
have
alabama
waste
being
generated,
but
a
very,
very
small
proportion
of
it.
what
is
significant
is
the
threat
of
the
synergistic
effect,
the
compounding
effect
of
these
tremendously
large
volumes
coming
in
from
out-of-state.
we
would--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--well,
again,
the
volumes,
the
findings,
the
first
two
or
three
specific
findings
of
the
legislature
address
the
volumes
coming
in
from
out-of-state.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
secondly,
there
was
testimony
in
the
trial
court
from
tom
joiner,
a
former
state
geologist
and
also
from
sue
robinson,
official
with
the
alabama
department
of
environmental
management,
that
the
volumes
were
the
problem.
and
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
is
the
synergistic
problem
of
compounding
that
we
face
here,
just
as
the
maine
case
was
a
threat
that
some
of
these
power
sites
may
cause
some
kind
of
harm
to
the
maine
fishing
industry.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
the
trial
court
found
there
was
no
difference
in
the,
to
distinguish
in-state
waste
from
out-of-state
waste.
the
difficulty
that
the
trial
court
did
not
address
was
the
fact
of
the
compounding
effect
of
all
of
the
volumes
of
hazardous
waste
coming
in
from
the
outside.
and
to
go
further
with
the
distinctions
we
have
here
as
opposed
from
the
city
of
philadelphia
case
is
the
fact
that
we
have
unlimited,
practically
unlimited
capacity
there
at
the
emelle
facility.
further,
there
are
facilities
under
the
restrictions,
under
these
oxymoron
restrictions
or
whatever
that
are
promulgated
by
the
government,
there
is
this
testimony
in
the
court
below
from
the
petitioner's
own
expert
witness
was
that
every
state
could
come
up
with
a
facility,
a
hazardous
waste
facility
to
take
care
of
its
own
waste.
the
difficulty
is
no
other
states
have
done
so.
no
other
states
have
stepped
forward
in
this
situation
other
than
the
one
facility
appropriately
named
at
last
chance,
colorado.
the
situation
here
is
such
that
unless,
unless
there
is
an
effort
by
alabama
to
do,
to
protect
its
health,
safety
of
its
citizens
and
the
environment,
then,
and
to
receive
compensation
for
the
transfer
of
the
risks
that
are
coming
in.
unlike
city
of
philadelphia
there
was,
that
was
an
outright
ban
case
with
no
transfer
of
risk.
here
we
have
the
transfer
of
risk
of
the
problems
from
these
other
states
into
alabama.
and
we
submit
alabama,
through
its
police
power,
has
a
right
to
control
the
volumes
through
the
additional
fee
and
also
to
receive
compensation.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
no,
sir,
because--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--the
threat
is
the
large
volumes.
it's
the
threat.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
but,
your
honor,
this
is
the
thing
that
has
brought
the
volumes
down,
that
has
reduced
the
threat
of
the
compounding--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--well,
sir,
because
we
have--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--again,
we
submit
that
that
is
the
appropriate
way
to
address
this,
the
reasonable
way,
and
still
remain
a
player
in
the
national
marketplace,
not
to
isolate
ourselves
from
the
problem.
and
that's
what
happened
with
new
jersey
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
case.
that
was
the--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--again,
your
honor,
the
question
was--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--in
this
instance
it's
established
that
the
ratio
has
remained
constant.
but
again,
the
reasonableness
of
the
difference
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
case.
that
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
and
we
did
increase
the
price
to
the
locals.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
no,
sir.
but
at
the
same
time
the
locals
are
going
to
be
there
to
be
confronted
with
the
short
and
long-term
health
hazards
there
within
their
own
state
of
alabama.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
because,
your
honor,
it's
the
nature
of
the
risk,
we
submit,
is
the
compounding,
the
synergistic
effect
of
the
tremendous
volumes,
the
threat
of
that
coming
in
from
out-of-state.
and
this
is
the
problem
that
we
wouldn't,
i
think
inference
can
be
drawn
that
alabama
wouldn't
be
confronted
with,
and
certainly
not
to
the
same
extent.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
but
that
overlooks,
your
honor,
we
submit,
the
key
distinction
here.
that
is
that
the
origin
of
the
volumes,
the
tremendous
volumes
of
hazardous
waste,
the
89
percent,
continuing
to
come
from
out-of-state,
and
that
this
again
represents
a
unique
situation,
a
transfer
of
risk
into
alabama.
and
what
is
going
to
happen
if
the
court
submitted
the
fact
that
if
the
court...
that
it
would
be
in
the
national
interest
for
the
court
to
uphold
alabama's
differential
fee,
because
if
it's
not
upheld,
if
this
is
struck
down,
then
the
states
like
alabama
are
really
going
to
have
to
be
thinking
long
and
hard
before
they
subject
their
people
to
the
problems
that
would
result
from
their
locating
a
hazardous
waste
landfill
within
their
own,
within
their
own
district,
because
the
difficulty,
again,
is
something
unique.
and
this
is
a
problem
that
can
be
distinguished
from
any
of
the
tax
cases,
any
of
the
highway
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
petitioner's
brief,
that
this
is
really
not
a
commerce
clause
case,
we
submit,
so
much
as
a
police
power
case.
and
that
in
this
instance
the
record,
so
totally
different
from
the
new
jersey
case,
shows
an
effort
by
alabama
to
do
the
two
things,
one,
to
reduce
the
large
quantities
of
hazardous
waste
coming
in
from
out-of-state
which
in
part
has
been
accomplished,
and
then,
and
then
to
compensate
for
the
transfer
of
risk.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
your
honor--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--we...
no,
sir,
we
don't,
in
the
sense
that
there
is,
we
submit,
still
the
difference,
the--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--that,
your
honor,
that
coupled
with
the
difference,
the
threat
in
difference
and
the
nature
of
the
risk
because
of
the
fact
that
the
volumes
change
them.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
no,
sir.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
well,
because
what
we're
showing
is
that
on
its
face
it
may
be
discriminatory,
but
in
the
practical
effect
it
is
not.
practical
effect
would
take
into
consideration,
and
that's
of
course,
as
i
understand
it,
the
test
that
was
applied
in
wyoming
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
we
would
submit
we
could,
your
honor,
because
the
practical
effect
of
what
alabama--
mr.
bert
s.
nettles
--we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
in
its
practical
effect
not
discriminatory
because
of
the
fact
that
the
nature
of
the
risk
is
different
because
of
the
tremendous
volumes
coming
in
from
out-of-state,
and
you
have
a
balancing
test,
we
submit,
that
would
be
the
more,
that
has
been
recognized
and
would
be
appropriate
in
this
instance
where
you
balance
the
risk
and
burdens
to
alabama
as
opposed
to
the
risk
and
burdens
of
outside.
and
i
would
suggest
this.
that
the
approach
being
taken
by
alabama
is
something
that
is
certainly,
the
credibility
of
it
is
certainly
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
you
have
the
national
governors'
association,
the
national
council
of
state
governments,
and
the
five
other
national,
state,
and
municipal
organizations
which
have
joined
together.
