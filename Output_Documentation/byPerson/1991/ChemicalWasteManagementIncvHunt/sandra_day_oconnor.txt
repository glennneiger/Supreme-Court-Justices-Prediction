justice
o'connor
mr.
pincus,
if
there
were
no
federal
legislation
governing
this
area
do
you
suppose
the
state
of
alabama
could
just
ban
any
importation
of
hazardous
waste
into
the
state?
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
exactly.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
suppose
instead
of
a
ban
they
could
just
knowingly
impose
a
tax
at
such
a
level
that
it
would
discourage
the
importation?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.--
--you...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
pincus,
do
you
suppose
congress
has
indicated
its
affirmative
consent
to
this
kind
of
a
scheme
in
alabama?
justice
o'connor
the
epa
has
approved
a
similar
state
tax
scheme
for
south
carolina.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
alabama
could
impose
a
uniform
tax
on
all
waste,
in-state
and
out.
