justice
byron
r.
white
were
these
claims
exhausted
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
state
collateral?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
were
they
disposed
of?
i
take
it
they
were
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
deny
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
a
procedural
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
know
why
they
denied
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
just
summarily
denied
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
specific
allegations
of
how
he
was
delinquent.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
an
opinion
written?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
agree
that
you
couldn't
satisfy
the
cause
in
prejudice.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
so
you
must
rely
on
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
jury
would
not
have
found
him
guilty
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
how
about
the
guilt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
there
wouldn't
be
a
fair
probability
that
he
would
not
have
been
found
guilty
of
the
crime
charged?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
on--
--you
mean
like
the
state
court
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
state
court
winnowed
out,
but
you
weren't
satisfied
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
presented
the
same
claim
in
the
second
habeas
proceeding
in
the
state,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
court
apparently
winnowed
it
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
that
the
state
court
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me,
counsel,
that
even
if
you
prevail
i
would
think
the
maximum
we
should
do
is
to
remand
to
the
state
court
to
have
the
hearing
that
was
denied
to
you
in
the
federal
courts.
why
have
the
hearing
in
the
federal
court
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
view
of
the
state's
obligation
is
just
to
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
when
does
one
in
louisiana
become
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you're
proven
guilty
of
a
capital
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
eliminate
the
necessity
to...
in
defining
eligibility
you
just
don't
think
about
whether
there's
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
there's
eligibility
for
the
death
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
eligible
for
the...
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
before
you
ever
get
to
the
sentencing
stage.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
position
of
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
the
fifth
circuit
rule
that
unless
you
show
the
ineligibility
for
the
death
penalty
that
the
successive
petition
should
be
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you...
louisiana
is
not
a
balancing
state,
or
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
do
you
think
it
would
come
out
differently
in
a
balancing
stage
where
the
jury's
instructed,
say,
that
unless
there
are
mitigating
factors
that
overpower
the
aggravating--
justice
byron
r.
white
--oh,
you
think...
you're
arguing
for
a
position
that
you
think
would
apply
in
a
balancing
state,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
state
deliberately
conceals
some
mitigating
evidence
that
the
defendant
didn't
know
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
on
first
federal
habeas,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
also
on...
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
the
state
court
was...
in
first
or
second
state
habeas
would
come
out
with
the
same
ruling
you
would,
even
if
the
state
deliberately
concealed
some
mitigating
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
the
mitigating
evidence
was
mitigating
evidence,
though,
that
the
jury
would
have
been
entitled
to
listen
to
and
the
state
deliberately
conceals
it.
i
would
think
you
would
say
you'd
have
to
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
am.
that
the
state
deliberately
conceals
some
mitigating
evidence
that
surely
if
the
defendant
had
known
about
it
would
have
put
before
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
go
to
any...
it
doesn't
go
to
the
proof
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
more
likely
than
not
of
a
substantial
disadvantage,
or
more
likely
than
not
that
the
result
would
have
been
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
see
any
problem
with
applying
that
analysis
when
the
challenge
is
to
something
in
the
sentencing
phase,
to
an
error
in
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
there's
a
balancing
requirement
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
not
eligible
to
the
death
penalty
or
any
other
penalty.
