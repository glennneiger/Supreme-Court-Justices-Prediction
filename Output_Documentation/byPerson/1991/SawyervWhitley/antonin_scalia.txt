they
could
have
put
in
evidence
at
that
point
about
his
incompetencies
apart
from
performance
at
trial,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
walker,
you're
not
asserting
that
your
client
was
innocent
by
reason
of
insanity,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
is
guilty
of
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
you
say
he
is
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
it
be
translated
into
the
penalty
phase
at
all?
i
mean,
why...
i
had
thought
that
we're
making
an
exception
for
compelling
circumstances
to
our
normal
rules
that
you've
had
a
fair
trial
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
we've
said,
you
know,
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
well,
if
in
fact
you
weren't
guilty
of
the
crime,
that's
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
but
you're
saying
even
if
you
are
guilty
of
the
crime
you
might
have
gotten
a
lesser
sentence.
i
don't
find
that
as
extraordinary
a
circumstance
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
certainly
not
our
jurisprudence
in
most
areas.
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
if
he
got
50
years
instead
of
10
years,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
agree
that
death
is
different
from
other
punishments,
but
so
is
punishment
different
from...
so
is
the
nature
of
the
punishment
different
from
the
question
of
innocence,
and
up
to
now
our
cases
have
only
held
that
if
you
are
innocent
can
you
have
a
second
trial,
and
you're
urging
us
to
carry
that
over
into
a
whole
new
area
where
you
are
not
innocent,
but
you
say
i
should
not
have
gotten
as
severe
a
penalty
as
i
did.
even
if
i
acknowledge
that
death
is
a
different
penalty,
i
don't
know
why
that
compels
me
to
say
that
this
particular
doctrine
should
be
extended
from
innocence
over
to
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
violates
that,
but
the
question
isn't
whether
you're
entitled
to
individualized
sentencing,
the
question
is
whether
you're
entitled
to
two
swings
at
it.
just
as
in
other
cases
whether
there's
any
violation
of
law
in
the
first
trial,
the
question
isn't
whether
you
are
entitled
to
whatever
that
violation
of
law
denied
you...
of
course
you
are
by
definition...
but
the
question
we're
speaking
to
today
is
whether,
having
through
your
own
fault
not
made
that
assertion
at
the
first
trial,
you're
entitled
to
have
a
second
trial,
and
we
do
that
when
you're
innocent,
that's
clear.
but
you're
saying
we
should
also
do
it
when
you've
gotten
too
high
a
sentence,
at
least
where
that
sentence
is
the
death
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
be
a
small
universe
of
cases
where
it's
true,
but
there
won't
be
a
small
universe
of
cases
where
it's
litigated.
it'll
be
litigated
fully
in
every
capital
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
number
of
elements
that
go
into
innocence
of
the
crime
are
relatively
limited.
the
number
of
elements
that
go
into
whether
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
you
would
have
gotten
a
lighter
sentence,
or
a
sentence
less
than
death
are,
god,
innumerable.
so
i
mean
it's
not
just
opening
the
door
another
crack,
it's
a
substantial
extension.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
succeed
in
making
second
federal
habeas
any
different
from
first
federal
habeas
with
respect
to
those
particular
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
it
has
to
be
extended
to
take
into
account
the
penalty
phase
at
all.
