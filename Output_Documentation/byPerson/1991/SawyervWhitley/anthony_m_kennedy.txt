justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
what
proceeding
were
the
hospital
records
first
annexed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
second
state
proceeding--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--second
state
collateral
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me,
how
is
your
proposed
standard
different
from
our
usual
harmless
error
inquiry?
i
take
it
it's
somewhat
heightened--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
one
you
propose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
the
standard
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
counselor.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
in
order
to
adjudicate
the
right
to
file
the
second
habeas
under
your
standard
you
would
have
to
go
through
an
inquiry
which
is
just
as
extensive
as
ruling
on
the
merits.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
full
and
complete
record
and
review
of
that
record
just
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
exception
applies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'd
have
to
say,
mr.
walker,
listening
to
your
argument
today,
and
your
very
moving
description
of
sawyer's
condition,
i
would
have
to
read
the
sentence...
the
transcript
of
the
trial
itself,
of
the
sentencing
hearing
and
all
of
the
affidavits
and
all
of
the
submissions
before
i
could
pass
on
the
validity
and
the
strength
of
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
position
is
not,
or
is
it,
that
cause
and
prejudice
inquiry
is
irrelevant
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
habeas
petition
should
be
filed
when
it
attacks
a
ruling
in
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
don't
even
have
a
cause
and
prejudice
inquiry
initially,
in
your
view,
if
sentencing
is
what
is
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
i'm...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
in
the
cause
and
prejudice
phase,
this
initial
threshold
determination
that
prejudice
is
somehow
unworkable
as
a
standard
when
you're
talking
about
a
sentencing
hearing.
