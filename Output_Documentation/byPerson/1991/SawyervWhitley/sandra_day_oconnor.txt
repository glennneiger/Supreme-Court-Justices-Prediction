before
you
sit
down,
counsel,
i
want
to
ask
whether
it
isn't
appropriate
that
in
this
particular
context,
where
you're
looking
for
an
exception
on
the
successive
habeas
petition,
that
you
apply
a
standard
that
is
tougher
than
the
standard
that
would
be
applied
the
first
time
around,
something
more.

something
more
than
harmless
errors,
something
more
than
the
strickland
prejudice
standard--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
i
don't
see
that
in
your
proposal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
suggested,
i
thought,
a
still
different
test,
one
that
goes
to
actual
innocence
of
the
substantive
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i'm
not
sure
your
test
would
take
into
account
in
any
event
the
differences
among
the
states
in
capital
sentencing
structure.
louisiana
is
one
type
of
state
which
has
narrowed
the
eligibility
in
a
certain
way,
but
there
are
different
types
of
schemes.
has
any
court
adopted
the
tests
that
you
suggest?
