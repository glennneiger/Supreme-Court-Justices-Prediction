mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
first
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question.
your
honor
asked
whether
the
more
likely
than
not
standard
applied
to
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
sykes
cause
and
prejudice
test,
and
in
our
view
the
answer
is
yes.
that's
our
understanding
of
it.
at
page
14
of
our
amicus
brief,
we
cite
and
excerpt
some
of
the
relevant
portions
of
this
court's
discussion
in
frady
which
was
later
reiterated
again
in
carrier,
and
what
the
court
said
there
was,
in
order
to
show
prejudice
you
have
to
show
not
merely
the
possibility
of
an
error,
but
that
something
worked
to
the
actual
and
substantial
disadvantage
of
the
defendant,
and
as
we've
read
that,
it
seems
to
indicate
that
the
defendant
has
to
show
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
could,
but
then
you
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
other
part
of
the
court's
discussion
in
these
cases,
which
is
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
is
stricter
than
the
plain
error
test.
now,
you
could
have
a
plain
error
that
doesn't
prejudice
the
jury's
verdict,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
if
you're
having
something
stronger
than
the
plain
error
test
in
the
prejudice
component,
in
light
of
also
the
discussion
of
the
way
you've
described
it
in
cases
of
frady
and
carrier,
we've
always
thought
that
it
really
requires
a
more-likely-than-not
showing
by
someone.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
latter,
your
honor...
more
likely
than
not
that
the
result
would
have
been
different.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
not
on
the
first
federal
habeas
petition,
your
honor,
but
here
we
think
where
the
second
petition
is
involved
that
is
a
wholly
inadequate
basis.
for
example,
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
made
no
effort
in
their
opinions
in
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief
to
reconcile
how
they
described
the
actual
innocence
doctrine
with
the
way
this
court
has
described
the
actual
prejudice
element
of
the
wainwright
v.
sykes
test,
and
we
think
they
really
can't
be
reconciled.
in
fact,
petitioner
by
essentially
abandoning
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit's
approach
has
virtually
conceded
that
point.
what
petitioner
has
tried
to
do
is
limit,
by
limiting
the
types
of
claims
that
supposedly
can
be
raised,
the
effect
there
would
be
on
the
operation
of
habeas
corpus
if
you
adopted
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit
tests.
in
essence,
he
has
said
you
should
limit
that
test
to
brady
claims
and
mitigating
evidence
claims,
and
we
think
the
only
virtue
of
that
limitation
is
that
it
fits
the
facts
of
his
case.
in
effect,
any
claim--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--you
betcha,
that's
absolutely
right,
and
we
think
this
court's
decision
in
dugger
v.
adams
is
inconsistent
with
that
type
of
approach,
so
we
think
the
standard
petitioner
has
adopted
clearly
is
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
already
decided
in
dugger,
and
with
the
approach
this
court
has
followed,
and
with
the
policy
concerns
that
have
led
this
court
to
adopt
the
ruling
last
term
in
mccleskey.
we
agree
with
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits
that
there
should
be
an
eligibility
approach.
we
just
differ--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
we
just
focused
the
eligibility
a
little
differently,
your
honor,
in
that
sense.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't,
and
neither
the
eighth
and
ninth,
so
it
is
in
fact
our
proposal
that
we
are
putting
forward
to
you
today,
because
this
will
affect
federal
cases
as
well
as
state
ones.
but
the
approach
we've
put
forward
can
be
applied
across
the
board,
whether
you're
in
a
state
like
louisiana,
which
does
the
narrowing
at
the
guilt
stage,
or
whether
you're
in
a
state
like
georgia,
for
example,
that
does
it
later
at
the
sentencing
stage.
our
position
is
this--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--absolutely,
which
is
in
a
case
like
mississippi.
our
position
is
very
simple.
if
a
defendant
is
convicted
of
a
crime
for
which
the
death
penalty
constitutionally
may
be
imposed,
he
is
not
actually
innocent
of
that
sentence.
in
other
words,
if
a
court
has
before
it
findings
that
are
adequate
under
this
court's
decision
in
tison
to
allow
the
death
penalty
to
be
imposed,
the
defendant
is
not
actually
innocent
of
the
death
penalty,
and
that
approach
is
one
that
can
be
applied
by
district
courts
across
the
board
in
georgia,
in
louisiana,
or
in
mississippi.
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
does
it
by
making
sure
that
what
you
have
is
a
proportionality
test.
in
a
noncapital
case
if
a
defendant
were
convicted
of
a
crime
for
which
the
type
of
sentence
he's
challenging
could
not
be
imposed
under
this
court's
decision
in
harmolin,
then
he
can
bring
that
type
of
actual
innocence
claim.
we
are,
if
you
will,
obliterating
that
distinction.
we
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
way
this
court
has
approached
it,
because
after
all
in
smith
and
murray
the
court
said
it
refused
to
adopt
special
cause
and
prejudice
rules
simply
because
there
was
a
capital
case
at
issue.
in
fact,
we
think
what
we've
got
here
is
a
system
that
will
adequately
work
and
solve
the
problems
that
some
people
from
the
bench
have
mentioned
on
how
to
dispose
of
these
cases
on
the
day
an
execution
is
scheduled
to
go
forward.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
the
jury
verdict
is
going
to
contain
with
it
under
the
statute
the
elements
of
the
offense,
and
in
virtually
every
state,
murder,
for
example,
is
going
to
be
the
capital
crime.
there
are
a
few
states
that
have
other
types--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if
he
can
show
he
didn't
do
it,
then
he's
actually
innocent
of
the
crime,
not
just
the
sentence.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
absolutely.
my
earlier
comment,
your
honor,
was
when
he
comes
in
challenging
only
the
sentence.
if
someone
can
come
in
and
show
that
he
didn't
do
it,
then
he
is
actually
innocent
in
the
sense
that
everyone,
i
think,
universally
agrees,
and
in
that
sense,
of
course,
he's
entitled
to
relief,
too,
but
that
is
how
you
should
narrow--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--he's
not
eligible
for
a
fine,
for
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
for
any--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
in
this
sort
of
context,
unless
you
can
show
something
like
that,
you
can't
come
into
federal
court.
if
he
has
other
claims
that
he
can
raise,
a
state
law
claim,
he
can
go
back
to
the
state
courts,
because
this
court
has
made
clear
in
estelle
v.
mcguire
only
earlier
this
term
that
you
can't
raise
state
law
claims
in
the
federal
courts,
so
he
has
to
tie
it
to
a
federal
constitutional
claim.
now,
as
we
said,
we
think
there
are
several
principals
that
support
this.
first,
the
court
has
made
clear
in
gregg,
in
tison,
in
mccleskey,
one,
that
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
for
the
crime
of
intentional
homicide.
second,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
aggravating
factors
serve
a
valuable
function
at
sentencing
but
they
do
not
define
the
elements
of
capital
murder.
third,
the
court
has
made
clear
in
a
case
involving
this
very
state's
capital
sentencing
laws,
lowenfield
v.
phelps,
that
whatever
essential
predicates
are
necessary
under
tison
or
the
other
cases
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
to
be
lawful,
those
predicates
can
be
established
at
the
guilt
stage,
they
don't
need
to
be
established
at
sentencing.
finally,
we
think
that
given
the
fact
that
at
this
stage
the
state's
judgment
should
not
only
be
presumed
to
be
correct,
but
given
the
fact
that
federal
habeas
has
once
gone
through
and
completed
without
finding
any
material
errors
that
the
presumption
should
be
virtually
irrebuttable
at
this
point,
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
focus
on
the
question
whether
the
prisoner
has
committed
an
offense
for
which
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed.
after
all,
aggravating
factors
are
that...
they
aggravate
the
crime.
if
the
crime
of
murder
can
be
punished
by
death,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
can
be,
we
think
at
this
stage
of
the
case
it
is
unnecessary
to
expand
the
limited
actual
innocence
exception
to
take
into
account
these
other
types
of
factors.
unless
the
court--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it
could,
your
honor.
that
would
even
be
a
narrower
position
than
we
had
urged.
you
could
just
drop
it
out,
and
that's
consistent
with
every
holding
in
this
court.
smith
and
murray
and
mccleskey
and
dugger
never
granted
relief
on
this
exception,
and
so
there
is
no
holding
of
this
court
that
would
apply
the
actual
innocence
exception
to
a
sentence
at
all,
but
we
haven't
gone
quite
that
far.
if
it
is
disproportionate
under
the
eighth
amendment,
we
would
say
that
you
are
therefore
not
eligible
for
that
sentence
and
it
should
not
be
imposed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
your
honor,
you
could
in
essence
flip
around
what
happens
at
trial.
there
there's
a
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
state
has
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
did
it.
to
show
actual
innocence
you
could
flip
it
around
to
the
habeas
stage,
put
the
presumption
on
the
prisoner
and
require
him
to
show
that
he
didn't
do
it.
now,
you
could
require
it
by
a
preponderance,
by
clear
and
convincing
which
is
close
to
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
latter,
of
course,
would
be
the
stiffest,
but
in
this
context
it
wouldn't
be
an
irrational
way
to
proceed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
we
have
not
in
our
brief
laid
out
which
of
those
three
approaches
to
take.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is,
but
it
has
not
yet
in
our
view
ever
been
dispositive
in
any
case.
thank
you.
