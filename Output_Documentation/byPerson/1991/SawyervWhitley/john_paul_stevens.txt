justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
think
under
the
normal
cause
and
prejudice
jurisprudence
that
the
prejudice
cause...
prejudice
prong
of
the
test
is
not
satisfied
unless
the
defendant
shows
it
was
more
probable
than
not
that
the
verdict
would
have
been
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
you
don't
say
that's
the
same,
then
you
are...
then
there's
a
difference
between
the
prejudice
standard
and
the
standard
your
opponent
is
advocating.
maybe
it's
not
sufficient
to
justify
it,
but
at
least
there
is
some
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think
everybody
agrees...
i
think
your
opponent
agrees
with
that,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
standard
he
proposes
is
more
stringent
than
the
normal
prejudice
standard,
and
i
did
not
understand
until
this
argument
that
normally
the
prejudice
prong
cannot
be
satisfied
unless
the
defendant
proves
that
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
he
would
have
been
acquitted.
i
thought
there
could
be
prejudice
that's
significant
but
not
quite
that
significant.
maybe
i'm
wrong,
i
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
it
boils
down
to
i
suppose
is
the
error
must
relate
to
an
aggravating
circumstance.
errors
relating
to
exclusion
of
mitigating
circumstances
could
never
justify
a
second
habeas.
i
think
that's
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
if
it
were
clear...
even
if
the
trial
judge
were
willing
to
say
i
am
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
if
the
jury
had
had
this
mitigating
evidence
they
never
would
have
returned
the
death
penalty,
your
position
would
still
be
that's
just
too
bad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
would
be
the
same
even
if
the
jury
had
not
heard
that
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
again,
even
if
that
weren't
true,
if
it
were
direct,
not
hearsay
evidence,
if
it
was
totally
credible,
it
would
still
be
tough
luck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree,
though,
that
something
could
be
to
the
actual
and
substantial
disadvantage
of
a
defendant
without
it
also
necessarily
being
true
that
the
verdict
would
more
likely
than
not
have
been
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
basically
it
removes
the
distinction
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
should
be
the
standard
for
applying
the
actual
innocence
exception
in
the
guilt
phase?
there's
a
sense
that
there
has
to
be
something
new
and
dramatic
or
you
have
the
wrong
man,
or
something,
but
what
do
you
think
the
test
ought
to
be
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
government's
position
on
the
proper
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
rather
important
point,
isn't
it?
