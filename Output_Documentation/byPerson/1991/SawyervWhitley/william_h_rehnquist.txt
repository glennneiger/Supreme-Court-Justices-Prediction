chief

william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
91-6382,
robert
wayne
sawyer
v.
john
whitley,
warden.
mr.
walker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
he
presented
those
in
both
the
first
and
the
second
habeas
petitions,
ineffective
assistance
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
first
state
collateral
proceeding
summarily
denied,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
factual
innocence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
make
that
claim
before
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
as
a
result
he
was
guilty
of
only
second-degree
murder?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question
if
i
may,
mr.
walker,
on
the
same
subject.
let's
say
that
in
sawyer's
first
federal
habeas
petition
he
brought
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
and
the
court
denied
it
because
he'd
failed
to
show
prejudice,
prejudice
i
take
it
being
an
element
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
then
he
brings
a
second
federal
habeas
petition,
he
brings
another
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
what
does
he
have
to
show
in
order
for
the
court
to
examine
the
merits
of
the
successive
claim
under
the
miscarriage
of
justice,
an
actual
innocence
exception,
that
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
show
in
showing
prejudice
the
first
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
just
about
the
same
thing
as
the
prejudice
element
of
strickland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really
the
actual
innocence
thing
really
means
almost
nothing,
if
you
take
that
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
that.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
language
in
smith
and
language...
that
is
fairly
ambiguous.
you
certainly
can't
say
it's
settled
the
other
way,
but
i
for
one
don't
regard
it
as
settled,
contrary
to
justice
scalia's
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
let's
take
this
in
the
real
world
that
we
deal
with
all
the
time
and
you
deal
with
all
the...
that
maybe
the
day
the
execution
is
set
the
lawyer
comes
in
for
mr.
sawyer,
mr.
abc,
and
says
i
have
this
claim
under
sawyer
v.
whitley
which
has
been
resolved
in
your
favor,
let's
assume.
i
can
show
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
the
jury
would
have
come
out
the
other
way.
here
are
five
affidavits.
the
district
judge
is
sitting
there,
the
execution
is
scheduled
for
that
night.
what
does
he
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you've
got
to
do
some
weighing
of
the
various
affidavits.
you've
got
to
determine
whether
it's
more
likely
than
not
the
jury
would
have
come
out
the
other
way.
this
is
really
not
a
paper
shuffle,
i
wouldn't
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walker.
ms.
pendergast,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
at
the
very
least,
ms.
pendergast,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
here
has
perhaps
taken
a
narrower
position
than
the
fifth
circuit.
do
you
agree
with
that
position
as
an
alternative?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
but
now
that
rule
would
be
different
in
first
federal
habeas--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
you
could
show
something
that
went
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--went
to
the
sentence,
and
if
it
was
material
you
would
probably
get
some
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
ms.
pendergast.
mr.
larkin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
if
the
court
has
before
it
findings
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
a
capital
eligible
offense.
do
you
mean
by
that
a
jury
verdict?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
a
defendant
comes
in
on
second
federal
habeas
with
some
rather
convincing
showing
that
a
witness
was
prevented
from
appearing
at
the
trial
and
that
the
witness
would
have
testified
that
he
was
10,000
miles
away.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
so
the
jury
verdict
could
be
upset
on
that
sort
of
a
showing,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
would
have
to
tie
the
evidence
he's
relying
on
to
some
sort
of
a
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
walker,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walker.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
91-6382,
sawyer
against
whitley.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
robert
sawyer,
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
by
a
louisiana
jury
for
the
murder
of
frances
arwood
which
was
committed
in
1979.
petitioner
and
his
accomplice
beat
arwood,
scolded
her
with
boiling
water,
and
lit
her
on
fire.
petitioner’s
conviction
and
sentence
were
upheld
on
direct
appeal
and
both
the
state
and
federal
courts
denied
later
petitions
for
habeas
relief.
the
district
court
denied
relief
to
sawyer
on
this,
his
second
federal
habeas
petition,
without
reaching
the
merits
of
the
bulk
of
his
claims,
because
it
concluded
that
the
claims
were
either
abusive,
that
is,
they
could
have
been
brought
in
his
first
petition
but
were
not
or
successive,
meaning
that
they
were
brought
and
decided
against
him
in
the
first
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
holding
that
sawyer
could
not
bring
himself
within
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
described
in
our
cases
because
he
had
failed
to
show
that
he
was
actually
innocent
of
the
murder
of
the
death
penalty.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
to
show
actual
innocence
of
the
death
penalty
so
as
to
allow
a
federal
court
to
reach
the
merits
of
abusive
or
successive
claims
a
petitioner
must
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
no
reasonable
juror
would
find
him
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
under
applicable
state
law.
this
standard
properly
concentrates
on
the
objective
factors
which
must
be
proved
before
a
defendant
is
eligible
to
have
the
death
sentence
imposed.
we
reject
petitioner’s
submission
that
the
standard
applied
by
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit
courts
of
appeals
which
would
allow
actual
innocence
to
be
established
by
showing
that
constitutional
error
prevented
the
jury
from
considering
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
including
mitigating
factors
would
allow
a
showing
of
actual
innocence
on
little
more
than
what
is
required
to
show
prejudice
under
our
present
law.
sawyer
must,
therefore,
show
that
the
evidence
claim
to
have
been
admitted,
omitted,
or
excluded
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
his
case
would
have
shown
him
to
be
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty.
he
is
not
made
such
a
showing
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
o’connor
have
joined;
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
