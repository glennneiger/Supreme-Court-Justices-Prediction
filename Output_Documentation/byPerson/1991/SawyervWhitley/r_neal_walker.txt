mr.
r.
neal
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
robert
sawyer's
mental
disorders
were
well-documented
when
he
went
on
trial
for
his
life
in
a
louisiana
courtroom.
hospital
records
show
that
sawyer
had
consistently
been
diagnosed
with
chronic
brain
damage
and
mental
retardation.
these
records
could
have
been
obtained
and
presented
to
the
jury
with
the
ease
of
licking
a
postage
stamp,
but
sawyer's
trial
lawyer
neglected
to
do
so.
thus,
the
jury
which
condemned
sawyer
to
die
was
unaware
of
the
fact
that
he
had
chronic
brain
damage
and
was
mentally
retarded.
sawyer
presented
this
indisputably
critical
evidence
in
a
successive
habeas
corpus
petition
claiming
that
his
trial
lawyer
performed
ineffectively
under
the
sixth
amendment,
but
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
technically
we're
speaking
here
with
a
successive
claim,
and
that
is
to
say
the
claim
was
presented
in
the
initial
petition
but
was
not
supported
with
the
hospital
records
we
refer
to
here
today.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
yes,
they
have
been.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
yes,
on
state
collateral.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
they
were
denied
on
the
merits,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
second
petition.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
they
denied
on
the
merits
with
no
reasons.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
it
was
not
a
procedural
default.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
denied
on
the
merits
as
a
ruling
of
the
state
trial
judge
and
state
supreme
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretionary
jurisdiction
declined
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
denied
on
the
merits.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
the
first
annexation
of
hospital
records,
justice
kennedy,
was
in
the
successive
state
post-conviction.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
right.
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
the
first
state
collateral
proceeding
resulted
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
there
was
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
then,
chief
justice.
the
essence
of
that
claim
was
that
trial
counsel
had
not
been
barred
for
2
years.
there
is
a
2-year
requirement
for
capital
defenders
in
indigent
cases
in
louisiana,
so
there
was
no
extensive
evidentiary
showing
made.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
there
were
some,
but
they
were
record-based,
your
honor,
they
were
not
based
on
allegations
that
he
neglected
to
investigate
the
case.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
from
the
state
post-conviction
denial?
mr.
r.
neal
walker
no.
i
would
add,
though,
that
even
in
that
proceeding
the
state
supreme
court
denied
review
by
a
vote
of
4
to
3,
but
there
was
no
opinion
that
was
generated.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
right.
justice
scalia,
there
was
an
allegation
that
he
had
not
effectively
investigated
the
case,
and
in
fact
there
was
an
allegation
that
although
he
knew
sawyer
was
in
a
mental
hospital
he
did
not
present
the
court
with
any
evidence
about
that
commitment.
in
effect,
when
the
successive
claim
came
before
the
federal
district
court
the
federal
district
court
faulted...
i'm
sorry,
not
the
successive
claim.
when
the
initial
claim
came
before
the
federal
district
court,
the
district
court
adopted
the
opinion
of
the
magistrate,
the
magistrate
faulted
initial
collateral
counsel
for
not
demonstrating
what
the
records
would
have
shown.
now,
when
the
successive
claim
was
dismissed
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit
fashioned
a
standard
for
reviewing
successive
claims
which
forecloses
any
constitutional
challenge
to
a
death
sentence
in
a
successive
posture
unless
the
constitutional
claim
carries
with
it
a
challenge
to
all
the
aggravating
factors
relied
on
by
the
jury.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
we
cannot
demonstrate
cause,
justice
white.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
we
submit
that
this
court's
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
doctrine
will
be
rendered
meaningless
if
the
fifth
circuit's
rigid
and
inequitable
eligibility
test
is
upheld
and
sawyer
is
denied
the
opportunity
to
prove
the
claims
in
a
successive
petition.
before
i
turn
to
a
discussion
of
the
standard
developed
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
sawyer's
alternative
proposed
standard,
i'd
like
to
spend
a
brief
minute
discussing
the
two
views
of
robert
sawyer
that
emerge
from
this
record.
the
first
view,
of
course,
is
the
view
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
the
picture
of
robert
sawyer
that
the
jury
considered
was
a
picture
of
a
person
portrayed
by
psychiatrists,
and
even
his
own
lawyer,
as
a
sociopath,
a
person
who
has
the
ability
to
control
his
behavior
but
freely
chooses
to
engage
in
conduct
harmful
to
others;
a
person
who
beat
up
and
ultimately
set
fran
arwood
on
fire
because
he
likes
to
do
those
things;
a
person
who
had
been
in
a
mental
hospital
one
time,
quote,
for
no
reason.
a
very
different
picture
of
robert
sawyer
emerges
from
the
evidence
presented
in
support
of
the
successive
habeas
claim.
that
picture
of
robert
sawyer
is
a
picture
of
a
person
who
has
been
committed
twice
in
his
life
to
mental
hospitals
and
in
fact
had
been
declared
on
one
occasion
incapable
of
competing
for
employment
in
the
outside
world.
for
that
robert
sawyer
the
world
is
a
very
confusing
place,
and
when
that
robert
sawyer
arrived
back
at
his
residence
the
day
the
homicide
was
committed,
he
was
confronted
with
a
terribly
confusing
situation,
because
after
entrusting
the
care
of
his
adopted
children
to
fran
arwood,
the
babysitter,
he
thought
one
of
them
had
been
drugged.
now,
robert
sawyer's
world
is
a
very
menacing
world,
one
where
people
are
constantly
out
to
get
him.
a
normal
person
may
not
have
thought
that
that
child
was
drugged,
but
robert
sawyer
thought
that
child
was
drugged,
because
robert
sawyer
sometimes
sees
problems
where
they
don't
exist
because
of
his
disabilities.
robert
sawyer
couldn't
think
this
problem
through.
his
mind
doesn't
work
this
way.
his
mind
won't
work
that
way.
his
mind
became
clouded
with
rage
and
he
exploded,
his
rage
feeding
on
itself,
and
he
beat
and
brutalized
fran
arwood.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
now...
and
i
refer
to
the
brady
claim...
that
indicates
that
sawyer
in
fact
did
not
participate
in
the
burning
of
fran
arwood.
that
is
the
evidence
in
the
successive
petition,
and
obviously
it
paints
a
very
different
picture
of
robert
sawyer's
culpability
and
a
picture
which
would
be
presented
and
would
have
been
presented
if
the
case
had
been
litigated
effectively
by
trial
counsel.
one
quick
review
of
the
medical
evidence
presented
in
the
successive
petition.
we
have
records
of
sawyer's
two
commitments
to
mental
institutions
and
references
to
a
third
treatment
at
an
outpatient
clinic
in
tennessee:
city
of
memphis
hospital's
discharge
diagnosis,
chronic
brain
syndrome
with
unknown
cause
manifested
by
mild
mental
retardation
and
abnormal
eeg
with
behavioral
disturbances.
western
state
mental
hospital,
similar
diagnosis,
incompetent.
recent
evaluations
in
1990
corroborate
those
older
historical
diagnoses,
same
diagnoses...
mental
retardation,
organic
brain
damage.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
litigation,
because
in
part
of
louisiana's
rigid
insanity
law,
your
honor.
it's
the
mcnaughton
right-wrong
test.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
he
is
guilty,
but
we
believe
guilty
of
second
degree
murder,
because
under
louisiana
law
in
order
for
one
to
be
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
the
murder
must
have
been
committed
while
the
offender
was
engaged
in
a
commission
of
another
aggravated
felony,
in
this
case
the
arson.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
that's
correct.
i
thought
you
meant
because
of
the
mental
state
evidence.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
the
brady
claim
was
made
before
the
lower
court.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct,
and
the
fifth
circuit
addressed
that.
if
i
may
move
on
to
the
question
of
eligibility,
the
integrity
of
the
concept
of
eligibility,
the
starting--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--let
me
move
to
a
discussion
of
our
standard,
chief
justice.
under
our
proposal--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--yes.
under
our
proposal,
first
he
would
have
to
show
a
factually
inaccurate
sentencing
profile
and
then,
to
respond
directly
to
your
honor,
he
would
have
to
show
under
either
our
proposal
a
fair
probability
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different...
that's
drawn
from
kuhlmann...
but
we
recognize
that
this
court
may
feel
it
desirable
to
strengthen
or
rigidify
that
standard,
because
it's
admittedly--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--it
is,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we
have
also--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--i
beg
to
differ.
let
me
qualify
that.
if
you
take
that
view,
perhaps
that's
correct,
except
that
under
our
standard
one
doesn't
just
look
to
the
burden
of
proof
but
to
the
nature
of
the
claim,
and
in
this
case
the
subset
of
strickland
errors
that
would
be
cognizable
under
this
exception
would
be
a
very
small
subset,
not
the
broad
array
of,
he
should
have
objected
to
this
testimony,
he
should
have
objected
to
that
exclusion
of
a
death-qualified
juror.
our
standard,
chief
justice,
is
the
fair
probability
standard,
but
we
also
endorse
a
much
more
strict
standard
that
was
on
the
table
in
strickland.
one
of
the
standards
that
was
on
the
table
in
strickland
before
the
court
in
trying
to
divine
what
an
appropriate
prejudice
standard
was
in
that
context,
was
the
strict...
as
it
was
described,
the
strict
outcome
determinative
standard
more
probable
than
not.
now,
johnson
v.
singletary,
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
of
course
also
adopts
the
eligibility
concept
as
a
definition
of
death
innocence,
we
believe
has
a
very
persuasive
dissenting
opinion
joined,
i
think,
by
four
justices.
judge
anderson,
writing
for
the
dissenters,
said
look,
we
got
to
recognize
here
the
state's
interest
in
finality,
but
we
also
have
to
recognize
that
some
prisoners
are
entitled
to
be
freed
up
from
the
constraints
of
cause
and
prejudice.
we
believe
a
standard
that
is
faithful
to
both
of
those
principles
is
the
more
probable
than
not
standard,
chief
justice,
which
is--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--more
probable
than
not
that
but
for
the
jury's
consideration
of
a
fundamentally
distorted
view
of
the
defendant's
culpability
that
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
the
trier
of
fact
or
the
sentencer
would
not
have
voted
death.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
no.
we're
talking
about
the
sentencing
phase
now.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
the
standard
that
emerges
from
this
court's
miscarriage
cases
in
the
liability
phase,
kuhlmann,
is
fair
probability.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that
sawyer
would
not
have
been
found
guilty?
mr.
r.
neal
walker
we
believe
that
there
is
a
fair
probability
that
considering
the
brady
violation
he
would
not
have
been
found
guilty,
but
i'm
addressing
the
chief
justice's
concern
with
how
we
translate
that
guilt-innocence
exception
into
the
penalty
phase,
and
we're
suggesting
that
although
our
standard,
the
standard
that
we
advocate,
is
the
kuhlmann
standard,
that
an
appropriate
standard
might
indeed
be
the
more
probable
than
not,
the
strict
outcome
determinative
standard
that
the
dissenters
in
the
eleventh
circuit
suggested
was
appropriate.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
justice
scalia,
just
as
we
have
a
right
to
have
a
fair
trial
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
there
was
an
equally
strong
right
to
a
fair
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
no,
we
wouldn't,
because
we're
talking
now
about
a
fundamentally
different
sort
of
proceeding,
and
we're
talking
about
a
proceeding
where
the
stakes
are
not
whether
he
goes
to
prison
or
not,
or
the
degree
or
length
of
a
period
of
incarceration,
we're
talking
about
whether
or
not
a
person
will
live
or
die,
and
this
court
has
noted
in
its
jurisprudence
since
gregg
itself
that
death
is
a
qualitatively
different
kind
of
punishment
than
any
other
punishment
that
can
be
doled
out
by
a
sentencing
judge
in
the
united
states
of
america.
and
again
i
think
that
if
we
reference
the
facts
of
this
case,
all
reasonable
people
would
agree
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair
that
robert
sawyer
has
not
at
least
had
a
chance
to
put
before
some
tribunal
his
severe
and
crippling
mental
disabilities
and
have
a
tribunal
at
least
evaluate
whether
or
not
if
that
evidence
had
been
presented
the
jury
may
have
voted
for
a
life
sentence.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
my
reading
of
smith,
justice
scalia,
is
that
that's
a
settled
question.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
i
might
say
that
this
court
in
its
guilt
phase
miscarriage
cases
has
indicated
that
what
is
important
in
that
context
in
assessing
innocence
is
whether
or
not
inaccurate
evidence
with
regard
to
culpability
was
put
before
the
jury.
our
standard
adopts
that
concept
and
inquires
as
to
whether
or
not
false,
inaccurate,
or
misleading
evidence
relative
to
culpability
was
put
before
a
sentencing
jury.
perhaps
a
look
at
the
court's--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--it's--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
radically
heightened
from
the
harmless
error
standard,
and
more
importantly
the
burden
falls
on
the
petitioner
and
not
the
state
in
this
instance.
the
burden
is
not
on
the
state
to
show
that
there's
no
reason--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--no,
the
standard
is
not
the
same.
the
standard
is
not
the
same
under
either
our
proposal
or
the
proposal
which
we
also
endorse
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
fundamentally
more
important
again,
it's
the
petitioner's
burden
and
not
the
burden
of
the
state
to
show
that
the
error
had
no
effect.
perhaps
i
might
briefly
discuss
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
because
hopefully,
justice
scalia,
it
will
answer
your
concern.
we
believe
that
as
a
construction
of
death
innocence
eligibility
is
a
fundamentally
flawed
concept,
because
it
collides
with
the
eighth
amendment's
core
concern
of
individualized
sentencing.
implicit
in
the
concept
of
eligibility
is
that
anyone
who
is
a
member
of
a
legislatively
defined
death
eligible
class
is
deserving
of
punishment
and
that
therefore
no
fundamental
injustice
can
occur
by
executing
anyone
within
that
class,
deserving
not
only
of
punishment
but
deserving
of
the
death
penalty.
now,
of
course
this
validates
the
eighth
amendment's
narrowing
function,
the
furman
half,
but
it
is
utterly
unfaithful
to
the
eighth
amendment's
core
consideration
of
individualized
sentencing.
in
our
view,
the
problem
with
eligibility
is
a
problem
with
the
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes
this
court
struck
down
15
years
ago.
this
court
struck
those
statutes
down
because
they
negated
the
individual
worth
of
a
human
being.
this
court
struck
those
statutes
down,
and
the
principle
that
emerged
from
those
holdings
is
that
a
capital
defendant
must
be
treated
as
an
individual,
and
of
course
that
is
recognized--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--well,
i'm
not
saying
that
we
should
do
it
when
we
have
too
high
a
sentence
at
all.
i'm
saying
that
we
do
it
when
the
death
penalty
has
been
imposed.
i'm
saying
that
there
should
be...
and
admittedly
it
will
be
a
very,
very
rare,
small
universe
of
cases,
but
that
there
is
that
universe
of
cases
where
a
jury
was
so
radically
misinformed,
like
in
this
case,
as
to
the
petitioner's
individual
culpability,
that
it
would
be
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
not
to
allow
a
petitioner
to
litigate
the
merits
of
a
claim
that
addresses
that
issue,
even
though--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--well,
i
think
that
our
district
courts
can
dispose
of
these
claims
quickly
on
the
paper
if
a
very
strong
threshold
showing
is
not
made.
i
might
also
point
out--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--well,
i
would
disagree
again,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
a
district
judge
could
winnow
out
the
huge
majority
of
filings
under
this
standard
that
we
propose
on
the
paper...
no
hearing,
no
stay.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
yes,
exactly,
the
state
court.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
that's
correct,
justice
white.
that's
why
we're
in
federal
court
now.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
the
claim
is
filed,
and
if
the
claim
is
not
made
out
on
the
face
of
the
pleadings
it's--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--well,
first
of
all
i
would
say
that
you
can't
keep
people
from
knocking
at
the
door.
if
there's
an
eligibility
standard
there
will
be
trials.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
i'm
sorry.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
you
can
narrow
the
door,
no
question
about
it,
but
there
will
be
filings
under
eligibility,
there
will
be
filings
under
the
actual
innocence
to
the
crime
exception.
the
question
a
moment
ago
was
apropos.
you
know,
why
didn't
you
make
a
challenge
to
the
state's
burden
of
proof
on
its
element
to
prove
mens
rea.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
it's
as
substantial
as
the
court...
as
your
honor
feels
it
is.
again,
i
think
that
the
claim
itself
is
a
factually
very
narrow
claim,
and
if
a
federal
district
judge
looks
at
the
claim
and
there's
no
showing
that
the
sentencing
profile
was
radically
distorted,
it's
dismissed
on
the
merits
that
quickly.
if
a
judge--
mr.
r.
neal
walker
--i'll
answer
that
and
then
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
at
least
in
the
fifth
circuit
that's
not
a
problem,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
same
panels
remain
on
the
cases
as
they
proceed
from
one
writ
to
the
next
if
it
goes
so
far.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
that
is
in
our
proposal,
i
believe.
it's
a
strict
outcome
determinative
test
again
that
your
honor
in
writing
for
the
strickland
court
noted
was
a
much
stricter
test
than
the
reasonable
probability
test.
we
think
that
that
would
satisfy
the
state's
interest
in
finality.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
well,
if
the
court
chooses
to
remand
it
to
the
state
court,
that's
fine
as
well.
we
think
the
proper
remand
would
be
to
the
district
court.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
neal
walker
first,
for
justice
o'connor's
benefit,
the
more-likely-than-not
standard
which
we
endorse
is
located
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief
in
note
1,
and
also
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
our
behalf
by
the
legal
defense
fund
discusses
that
test
extensively
beginning
on
page
40.
secondly,
this
jury
heard
no
evidence
whatsoever
about
sawyer's
mental
retardation,
or
even
his
low
intelligence,
and
certainly
heard
nothing
about
organic
brain
damage.
third,
i
believe
that
we've
heard
here
a
concession
that
wainwright
v.
sykes
prejudice
is
a
lesser
showing
than
the
prejudice
inquiry
that
we're
advocating
here.
the
sykes
prejudice
is
that
the
error
works
to
the
petitioner's
actual
and
substantial
disadvantage.
justice
stevens,
i
disagree
that
you
may
not
have
to
show
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different
in
that
situation,
in
our
situation
you
do.
but
primarily
what
i
want
to
address
for
the
minutes
remaining
is
smith
v.
murray,
and
i
simply
disagree
that
smith
v.
murray
does
not
categorically
hold
that
the
actual
innocence
exception
applies
in
capital
sentencing
proceedings.
what
smith
said
was,
it
may
not
be
easy
to
translate,
but
it
does.
now,
the
court
found
no
reason
to
do
it
in
that
case,
because
mr.
smith
had
a
claim
of
legal
innocence,
not
actual
innocence.
in
terms
of
the
holding,
the
holding
in
that
case
is
purely
expressed
in
this
sentence:
in
short,
the
error
neither
precluded
the
development
of
true
facts
nor
resulted
in
the
admission
of
false
ones.
we
have
an
error
that
did
preclude
the
development
of
true
facts.
constitutional
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
meant
that
the
jury
never
heard
robert
sawyer
was
mentally
retarded
and
brain
damaged.
it
also
resulted
in
the
admission
of
false
facts.
that
evidence
was
that
robert
sawyer's
a
sociopath.
we
think
we
squarely
fit
within
smith
v.
murray,
and
it
would
be
a
gross
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
to
not
give
robert
sawyer
a
hearing
on
the
claims
he's
presenting
in
the
successive
habeas
corpus
petition.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
