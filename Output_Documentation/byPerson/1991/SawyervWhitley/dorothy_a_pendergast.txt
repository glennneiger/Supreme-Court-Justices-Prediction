ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
louisiana
endorses
the
fifth
circuit's
definition
of
actual
innocence
of
the
death
penalty
and
urges
this
court
to
adopt
that
definition
at
the
very
least.
since
louisiana
narrows--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--i
do
agree
with
it,
because
louisiana
narrows
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
at
the
definitional
stage,
so
it
really
is...
the
solicitor
general's
definition
is
a
workable
and
acceptable
definition
to
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
i
propose
to
defend
the
fifth
circuit's
definition
and
allow
mr.
larkin
to
defend
the
solicitor
general's
definition.
this
court
has
said
that
actual
innocence
does
not
translate
easily
into
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
trial,
and
in
reality
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit's
definition
and
mr.
sawyer's
proposed
definition
do
not
translate
at
all
into
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
trial,
because
their
definitions
concentrate
on
discretionary
factors.
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
trial
that
is
the
wrong
question
to
ask
of
any
sentencing
hearing.
a
sentencing
is
a
societal
response
to
what
the
sentencer
heard.
the
sentencer
not
only
heard
what
went
on
at
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial,
but
the
sentencer
heard
the
gruesome
details
of
the
trial,
of
the
crime
at
trial,
and
his
evaluation
is
the
discretionary
process,
and
he
brings
a
certain
set
of
values
and
a
certain
background
to
that
evaluation,
and
the
resulting
sentence
is
his
societal
response.
you
cannot
be
innocent
of
a
societal
response,
you
can
only
be
innocent
of
objective
factors
such
as
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
crime.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
in
the
guilt
phase,
and
then
when
we
come
to
the
penalty
phase
we
have
certain
objective
factors
which
are
aggravating
factors.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
actually,
you
are
tried--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--of
the
first
degree
murder.
a
first
degree
murder
is...
at
the
definitional
stage
defines
those
crimes
and
even...
you
go
on
trial
for
first
degree
murder
and
you
have
death
or
life
as
a
possible
penalty.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
then
when
we
go
to
the--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--in
louisiana?
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
we
have
to
have
an
aggravating
circumstance.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
but
that's
built
into
the
definition
of
first
degree
murder,
the
aggravating
circumstance.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
and
then
when
you
go
to
the
penalty
phase
the
jury
is
told
that
they
have
to
find
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
then
they
are
to
consider
the
mitigating
circumstances
to
determine
whether
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
by
the
definitional
stage,
actually.
the
state
of
louisiana
clearly
supports
the
fifth
circuit
view
because
the
fifth
circuit
is
concerned
with
the
eligibility
which
are
at
the
death
penalty
phase,
and
those
are
objective
standards
to
which
we
can
measure
something.
where
sawyer's
proposed
definition
is
unclear,
the
standard
is
unclear
and
it
does
not
go
to
any
objective
factors
which
can
be
measured.
what
he
actually
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
bypass
the
cause
prong
of
cause
and
prejudice
and
have
a
mere
prejudice
test,
because
he
does
not
implicate
the
objective
factors
at
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial.
if
we--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--the
prejudice
prong
of
a
cause...
and
we're
talking
about
the
guilt
phase?
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i
could
not
be
certain
of
the
precise
language,
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
in
my
opinion,
the
difference
is
merely
a
matter
of
semantics,
that
it's
a
nebulous
position,
because
we
can't
ever
judge...
it
would
produce
so
much...
and
also
we're
talking
about--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--second
federal
habeas...
the
cause
and
prejudice
jurisprudence
has
to
do
with
procedural
default
and--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--abuse
of
the
writ
on
first
federal
habeas,
but
now
we're
talking
about
second
federal
habeas.
shouldn't
we
make
the
standard
even
more
strict--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--than
on
first
federal
habeas?
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
check
myself
on
the
precise
language
of
more
probable
than
not.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
my
position
is
that
the
attacking
a
ruling
in
a
sentencing
phase
on
a
second
federal
habeas
should
only
go
to
the
objective
factors
that
go
to
the
actual
innocence
of
the
person
to
the
objective
factors
found
that
make
this
person
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
if
we
go
beyond
that
we
are
getting
into
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
sentencing
phase.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
well,
yes,
that's
right.
he's
already
admitted
that
there
is
no...
if
we
don't...
if
he
satisfies
cause
and
prejudice
we
don't
even
get
to
the
actual
innocence.
we
only
get
there
because
he
cannot
satisfy
cause
and
prejudice.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
that's
what
i
am
saying.
i'm
saying
it
is
unworkable
unless
you
look
at
only
objective
factors
that
make
him
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
because
what
we
will
be
doing
is
looking
at
the
discretionary
area.
we
don't
even
do
that
at
the
guilt
phase
under
a
jackson
v.
virginia
analysis.
when
we
review
a
guilt
phase
for
sufficiency
of
evidence,
we
only
look
at
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution,
so
we
go
to
the
penalty
phase,
how
can
we
then...
it's
a
lesser
standard
to
look
at
anything
beyond
the
eligibility
factors
at
the
penalty
phase.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
did
talk
about
jackson
v.
virginia,
and
the
core
concern
of
jackson
that
we
not
invade
the
discretionary
area
of
the
jury.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
that's
the
position
of
the...
that
the
error
must
go
to
the
eligibility--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--of
the
defendant
for
the
death
penalty.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i
think
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
proposes.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
i
agree.
yes,
and
i
think
this
is
clearly
supported
by
dugger
v.
adams
where
this
court
said
that
a
caldwell
error
is
no
cause
for
procedural
default,
and
a
caldwell
error
goes
to
the
accuracy
of
the
sentencing
determination.
also,
a
definition
as
sawyer
proposes
would
play
havoc
with
sawyer
v.
smith,
which
said
that
a
caldwell
error
could
not
be
applied
retroactively,
and
i
think
by
adopting
a
type
of
definition,
that
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit
propose
or
that
sawyer
proposes,
would
create
confusion
in
the
jurisprudence
of
federal
habeas
in
the
retroactivity
cases
under
teague
v.
lane.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
no,
it
is
not
a
balancing
state.
we
do
not
weigh
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
no.
i
think
that...
we
are...
that...
if
it
comes
out
on
first
federal
habeas,
that's
one
thing,
but
when
we
come
to
the
second
federal
habeas
we
must
narrow
that
review
and
that
application
of
actual
innocence
even
more
to
objective
factors
and
just
eliminate
the
discretionary
factors.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
i
do,
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
fact
that
sawyer's
definition,
he
tries
to
eliminate
and
narrow
it
by
saying
that
prophylactic
rules
not
bearing
on
culpability
would
not
qualify,
but
perhaps
we
would
have
an
increased
litigation
to
define
what
prophylactic
rules
would
bear
on
culpability.
his
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
would
be
eliminated
except
in
rare
cases.
i
can
see
that
there
would
be
further
litigation
in
successive
petitions
to
define
what
are
the
rare
cases
that
would
qualify
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
his
miscarriage
of
justice
standard
includes
only
those
errors
where
the
jury
heard
false
evidence
or
were
precluded
from
hearing
true
mitigating
facts.
his
standard
overrules
mccleskey
insofar
as
mccleskey
set
the
standard
for
a
miscarriage
of
justice
by
saying
that
a
miscarriage
of
justice
is
not
promoted
by
just
mere
error,
not
mere
constitutional
error,
and
not
mere
prejudicial
constitutional
error,
but
prejudicial,
constitutional
error
that
goes
to
guilt
or
innocence.
and
when
we
translate
that
into
the
penalty
phase,
it
can
only
be
done
with
any
kind
of
reasoning
if
we
adopt
a
test
like
the
fifth
circuit
that
goes
to
the
eligibility
of
the
defendant
for
the
death
penalty
which
implicates
only
objective
factors.
any
other
definition...
any
broader
definition
will
violate
the
concerns
of
finality,
of
state
court
convictions
because
there...
it
will
be
only
increased
litigation
in
the
federal
habeas
area,
and
it
will
violate
the
concerns
of
comity
between
the
state
and
federal
courts.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
that
this
is
a
second
federal
habeas
petition,
that
the
standard
of
review
should
be
more
strict
than
on
the
first
federal
habeas
petition,
and
that
actual
innocence
should
be
limited
to
only
those
extraordinary
cases
where
the
defendant
would
be
actually
innocent
or
not
eligible
to
have
the
death
penalty
imposed.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
we
are
talking
about
a
sentencing
hearing
where
there's
no
correct
outcome,
and
that
this
is
a
discretionary
area
and
we
cannot
allow
a
federal
court
to
reweigh
mitigating
evidence
and
substitute
its
judgment
and
its
reweighing
for
the
state
sentencer
or
the
state...
the
highest
court
in
a
state.
this
violates
the
core
concerns
of
comity
between
state
and
federal
courts.
sawyer
mistakenly
has
claimed
that
the
state
must
prove
that
death
is
the
appropriate
penalty
in
his
brief,
and
i
want
to
remind...
point
out
to
this
court
that
louisiana
does
not
require
the
state
to
prove
that
death
is
an
appropriate
penalty,
that
louisiana
only
requires
after
a
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
that
the
state
prove
an
aggravating
circumstance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
then
the
jury
is
charged
to
consider
the
mitigating
evidence,
or
mitigating
circumstances,
and
to
determine
whether
death
is
appropriate.
so
the
only
thing
the
state
has
to
prove
is
one
aggravating
circumstance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
louisiana
is
not
a
weighing
state,
and
additional
facts
in
mitigation
would
not
be
a
substantial
consequence
for
the
reviewing
court
in
louisiana.
let's
look
at
the
facts
that
sawyer
proposes
here
to
support
his
miscarriage
of
justice
claim.
he
has
the
mental
defect,
the
abusive
childhood...
the
jury
heard
in
skeletal
form
most
of
the
information
that
sawyer
now
proposes.
we
have
to
remember
that
sawyer
testified
at
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial.
he
testified
to
the
murder
of
the
4-year-old
child
in
arkansas,
he
testified
to
his
childhood
and
his
upbringing,
and
he
testified
to
the
crime
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
could
only
remember
bits
and
pieces.
the
jury
did
have
an
opportunity
to
see
him,
to
evaluate
him,
and
decide
for
themselves
what
sort
of
mental
defect
or
slow
learner
he
might
have
been--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--yes,
it
would.
my
position
is
the
same.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
if
the
mitigating
evidence
does
not
go
to
the
objective
factors
on
second
federal
habeas,
i
think
his
big--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--i
think
there's
a
burden
there
that
they
do
it
on
first
federal
habeas.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
if
the
mitigating
evidence
didn't
go
to
the
actual
innocence.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
don't
understand.
you're
asking
me
a
question?
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i
think
the
question
is
does
that
mitigating
evidence
go
to,
you
know,
his
early
childhood--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--then
i
don't
think
that
should
necessarily
trigger
a
review
or
a
remand.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
it
would.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
right.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
we
have
to
be
conscious
that
the
brady
claim
that
petitioner
puts
forth
here
is
not
supported
by
admissible
evidence,
it's
based
on
double
and
triple
hearsay,
and
that
the
time
that
he
has
waited
to
put
forth
this
evidence
in
front
of
the
court
cast
doubt
on
its
credibility.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
on
second
federal
habeas,
yes,
otherwise
you
have
no
distinction
between
first
and
second
federal
habeas.
we
have
to
remember
also
that
the...
that
sawyer
could
be
charged
and
convicted
as
a
principal
in
louisiana,
that
he
admitted
to
hitting
fran
arwood
and
admitted
to
hitting
her
twice,
causing
her
to
bleed
from
her
mouth,
he
had
the
key
to
the
door,
the
deadbolt,
in
his
pocket,
he
ordered
cindy
and
the
two
boys
to
the
bedroom,
he
had
admitted
being
in
the
bathroom
where
she
hit
her
head
on
the
bathroom...
on
the
tub
and
lost
consciousness.
he
admitted
to
being
there
when
detergent
and
scalding
water
was
poured
over
her,
he
never
denied
participation
in
this
crime.
he
never
denied
that
his
fingerprints
were
found
on
the
lighter
fluid
can.
he
only
said
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
could
only
remember
bits
and
pieces,
and
i
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
fifth
circuit
definition
because
any
broader
definition
would
overrule
mccleskey,
lend
credibility
to
last-minute
hearsay
affidavits,
lend
credibility
to
physical
and
mental
examinations
done
today
and
applied
to
yesterday,
and
buy
into
a
distortion
of
the
record
and
sanction
said
sandbagging.
thank
you.
