mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
in
this
case
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
low-level
radioactive
waste
policy
amendments
act
of
1985
as
being
in
violation
of
the
federal
system,
and
specifically
we
place
our
reliance
on
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
guaranty
clause.
we
recognize
that
congress
certainly
has
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
deal
with
the
subject
of
the
disposal
of
low-level
radioactive
waste,
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
means
that
it
has
chosen
here
is
constitutionally
defective.
this
act
is
directed
solely
at
the
states
and
makes
the
states
responsible
for
the
disposal
of
low-level
radioactive
waste
that
is
generated
within
the
state.
it
makes
the
states
responsible
for
the
disposition
of
the
waste
of
private
generators,
federal
generators,
as
well
as
any
that
is
generated
by
the
state
itself.
this
is
a
totally
mandatory
provision
which
requires
the
states
to
stay,
to
enter
and
to
stay
in
the
field
of
low-level,
disposal
of
low-level
radioactive
waste.
the
mandate
is
made
particularly
effective
by
the
so-called
take
title
provision
which
specifies
that
if
the
state
has
not
otherwise
provided
for
the
disposal
of
low-level
radioactive
waste
by
january
1,
1996
that
the
state
must
take
title
of
any
such
waste,
and
if
it
doesn't
accept
possession
that
it
becomes
liable
for
any,
to
the
other
generators
if
there
are
any
damages,
direct
or
indirect.
in
other
words,
one
way
or
the
other
the
states
are
simply
ordered
by
congress
to
enter
this
activity.
the
statute
is
truly
unique
in
the
annals
of
american
jurisprudence.
we
know
of
no
other
situation
where
the
states
have
simply
been
mandated
to
take
part
in
a
particular
activity.
in
the
past
what
congress
has
done,
it
has
essentially
recruited
the
states
in
one
of
two
ways
to
do
the
regulation
that
the
federal
government
would
like
to
have
done.
it
has
either,
as
in
the
hodel
case
involving
the
land
mine,
surface
act,
it
gives
the
states
an
option.
you
regulate
according
to
the
standards
set
out
by
the
federal
government,
or
otherwise
we,
the
federal
government,
will
do
the
regulation
itself.
the
other
means
that
they
have
chosen
is
the
spending
clause,
and
to
provide
federal
money
as
an
inducement
for
the
states
to
do
regulation
in
accordance
with
federal
standards.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
that
is
legal,
but
it
hasn't
done
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
means
that
the
congress
uses
is
a
very
important
consideration
in
the
constitutional
structure
of
this,
of
the
government.
it
is
our
basic
position
that
the
constitution
contemplates
two
sets
of
sovereigns
and
that
the
states
are
intended
to
have
the
choice
as
to
which
activities
they
will
participate
in.
so
we
think
that
the
means
that
the
congress
chooses
is
by
no
means
a
minor
one.
we
think
it
is
a
vital
one,
and
we
think
it's
a
serious
incursion
on
the
constitutional
structure.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
we
think
that's
perfectly
acceptable.
we
have
no
problem,
and
we
have
not,
have
never
objected
to
that
separately.
but
we
think
that's
not
a,
what
this
case
is
all
about
either.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we
think
not.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
think
the
legislative
history,
all
of
which
really
shows
up
in
the
congressional
record
i
think
on
december
19
of
1985,
the
day
that
this
law
was
passed,
shows
that
the,
we
don't
think
it
would
have
been
passed
by
simply
excising
the
take
title
provision.
we
think
probably
some
law
would
have
been
passed,
but
it
may
have
been
something
very
different.
and
as
we
read
your
cases
that,
if
it
is
clear,
as
we
think
it
is,
they
wouldn't
have
passed
the
legislation
by
simply
excising
the
provision.
then
it's
not
severable,
and
there
isn't
any
severability
clause
here.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
we
read
the
legislative
history,
it
came
at
the
instance
of
the
governors
of
the
so-called
sited
states,
ones
that
had
disposal
sites,
and
they
made
it
plaint
that
they
did
not
think
that
the
legislation
as
it
stood
at
that
point
was
sufficiently,
it
didn't
have
enough
teeth.
and
they
were
concerned
that
the
same
thing
that
happened
under
the
1980
act
would
happen
with
respect
to
the
1985
act,
so
they
said
we
need
teeth.
however,
the
question
of,
this
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
it
is
severable
or
not,
and
all
i
can
do
is
i
think
refer
the
court,
in
addition
to
what
i
have
said
here
on
severability,
to
our
brief
and
commend
that
you
examine
that
legislative
history.
i
suppose
the
threshold
question
before
the
court
in
light
of
the
garcia
decision
which
the--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
i
think--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
i
think
there
are
two
elements,
justice
scalia.
if
it
works
is
the
second
element,
but
the
first
element
is
whether
it's
apparent
that
it
would
not
have
been
passed
without
it.
it
may
be
that
it
would
be,
if
one
doesn't
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
this
case,
you
might
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
is
severable,
because
i'm
not
sure
you
can
tell
for
sure
that
it
would
not
have
passed.
but
for
those
of
us,
for
those
who
do
look
at
legislative
history
we
think
that
the
law,
that
it
is
apparent
that
it
would
not
have
been
passed
in
that
form
by
simply
excising
the
take
title
provision.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes.
as
i
recall
it
it
originated
in
the
senate.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
senator
moynihan
supported
the
legislation.
we
don't
think
that...
well,
if
i
may
i
will...
that
is
correct,
but
i
will
discus
that
slightly
later.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
not
in
a
constitutional
sense,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
he
was
representing
the
people
of
new
york
and
he
was
acting
as
a
senator,
but
he
was
not
representing
the
constituted
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
has
to
speak
through
the
legislature
and
the
governor.
and
that
is
i
think
what
this
case
is
all
about,
that
the,
that
the
constitutional
system
does
contemplate
action
through
the
state
legislatures
and
through
the
state
governments.
we
think
that
is
what
the
federal
system
means
and
that
is
what
did
not
happen
here.
that
is
why
we
think
this
case
is
properly
reviewable
within
the
confines
of
the
garcia
case.
you
will
recall
while
the
garcia
case
essentially
said
that
this
court
will
not
normally
review
tenth
amendment
challenges,
it
did
recognize
that
it
would
consider
or
might
consider
statutes
that
impair
the
constitutional
structure.
and
we
think
that,
contrary
to
the
decisions
below,
that
review
of
this
case
comfortably
fits
within
what
was
left
open
in
the
garcia
case.
in
fact
we
suggest
that
very
little
else
would
fit
in
any
better
than
the
present
case.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
because
this
act
regulates
not
so
much
commerce
as
it
regulates
the
states.
it
picks
out
the
states
and
simply
directs
the
states,
that
you
must
do
a
particular
activity.
we
think
that
is
not
a
power...
we
think
the
decision
as
to
whether
to
act
with
respect
to
engaging
in
a
particular
activity
is
one
that
is
reserved
to
the
states
under
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
this
is...
the
difference
between
this
case
and
those
cases,
your
honor,
is
that
there
what
congress
is
doing
is
to
regulate
an
activity
that
the
state
has
already
chosen
to
undertake.
it
could
withdraw
from
that
activity
if
it
chose.
i
mean,
that's
the
kind
of
case
that
was
involved
in
the
trilogy
of
fair
labor
standards
act
cases,
wertz,
national
league
of
cities,
and
the
garcia
case.
it's
also
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
involved
in
south
carolina
against
baker,
where
the
federal
government
decided
generally
not
to
permit
unregistered
bonds
if
people
chose
to
issue
bonds,
and,
as
to
states,
if
they
were
tax
free.
but
it
was
applying
across
the
board
generally.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right.
this
case
is
in
many
ways
analogous
to
an
earlier
new
york
against
united
states
case,
the
one
involving
the
taxing
of
the
waters
from
saratoga
springs
that
were
sold
by
the
state
of
new
york,
where
the
court
did
say
that
you
could
tax
new
york
if
you're
taxing
them
like
everyone
else,
but
the
court,
admittedly
by
way
of
dicta,
made
it
plain
that
the
situation
would
have
been
very
different
if
you're
simply
singling
out
the
states
and
simply
taxing
them.
and
the
whole
court
seemed
to
think
that
that,
said
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
we
think
that's
precisely
the
problem
here.
this
is
a
problem
in
this
case
that
was
essentially
left
open
or
avoided,
if
i
might,
in
ferc
against
mississippi,
where--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--no,
we're
not.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
absolutely.
we
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
open
door
and
what
happens
in
some
other
cases
we
leave
to
another
day.
we
think
that
it
plainly
doesn't
need
to
be
overruled.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no.
we
think
ferc
is
quite
distinguishable.
the
majority
of
this
court
in
ferc
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
state
had
a
choice.
it
didn't
really
have
to
do
what
that
act
of
congress
required
it
to
do
because
it
didn't
have
to
regulate
public
utilities,
while--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
that's
what
some
of
the,
that's
what
the
dissenters
indicated,
and
i'm
not...
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
decision
as
it
was
written
indicated
quite
plainly
that
that
was
critical
to
that
decision.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
think,
justice
kennedy,
that,
as
justice
o'connor's
opinion
recently
in
the
ashcroft
case
indicated,
that
the
federal
system
is
a
very
significant
element
in
the
constitutional
structure,
so
we
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
etiquette.
we
think
that
it
is
important
for
the
states
to
be
able
to
determine
when
to
undertake
activities,
where
to
place
their
resources--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--absolutely.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we
think
that,
for
one
thing
it
is
the
question
of...
waste
can
be
stored
as
opposed
to
disposed
of
on
a
short-term
basis,
short-term
basis
meaning
quite
a
few
years.
that's
certainly
what
is
being
done
with
respect
to
high-level
radioactive
waste.
so
it's
not
as
if,
this
isn't
a
question
of
whether
we
have
to
ship
it
out
of
state
or
not.
it's
a
question
of
whether
we
have
to
do
this
according
to
the
drum
beat
of
the
federal
government
where
they
don't
choose
to
do
it.
actually
we're
subject
to
federal
regulation,
we're
being
given
a
time
table
which
we're
not
convinced
is
meaningful
or
desirable
for
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york.
so
in
that
context
we
think
the
federal
government
should
be
doing
the
regulation
rather
than
imposing
its
will
directly
on
us.
and
it's
not
a
matter
of
shipping
it
out.
it's
a
matter
of
how
we
control
our
own
destiny.
i
do
want
to
say
that,
perhaps
in
conjunction
with
your
question,
that
it
is
argued
by
our
opponents
that
this
is
really,
was
an
agreement
among
the
states,
and
that
somehow
that
is
the
way
the
federal
system
is
supposed
to
operate.
now
we
just
don't
understand
that
here.
the
constitution
does
provide
for
agreements
though
compacts,
which
again
involves
the
formal
action
of
various
state
legislatures
and
the
executive,
but
you
don't
do
agreements
by
having
lobbying
activities,
even
from
the
governors'
association
or
other
similar
groups
and
say
that
represents
a
state
agreement.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
think
the
government
could
also
probably
find
an
appropriate
means
of
doing
it.
the
problem
is
that
they
didn't
do
it,
and
we
think
that
this
opens
up
a
pandora's
box.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
precisely
our
position.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
no,
it's
not
totally
correct.
i
mean,
it
may
be
like--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--it
may
be
like
finding
a
prison,
except
that
i
know
our
experience
in
new
york
is
that
there
are
some
areas
that
want
prisons
because
of
the
income
that
it--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
we
agree
with
that
position,
and
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
congress
has
made
the
directive
and
all
the
burdens,
all
the
accountability
is
shifted
to
the
state
which
doesn't
have
the
right
to
decide
whether
to
do
it
or
not.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
think
the
basic
decision
is
that
of
the
state.
that's
correct.
i
mean--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--not
in
this
case,
no.
i
mean,
it's,
the
national
league
of
cities,
you
point
out
the
tenth
amendment
did
apply
to
counties
in
some
respects,
but
i
think
in
this
case
it
would
be
the
state
that
is
being
protected,
and
that's
all
that
any
of
the
petitioners
have
argued.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
if
it's
only,
if
it's
foisted
on,
justice
white,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
but
if
they
give
us
a
choice
of
we
will
pay
half
of
this
and
you
have
an
option
as
to
whether
you
do
it,
which
in
the
scheme
that--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--i
think
our
position
is
that
as
long
as
they
mandate
it
without
giving
the
legislature--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
absolutely
not.
and
by
the
way,
i
should
say
that
the
government
somehow
thinks
in
its
brief
that
the
spending
clause
is
involved
here
because
of
the
payments
that
go
from
the,
some
money
is
going
from
the
generators
and
some
of
it
goes
in
an
escrow
fund.
but
the
statute
makes
it
clear
that's
not
federal
money.
it's
not
appropriated,
it's
simply
kept
there.
so
i
simply
don't
understand
the
argument
that
the
government
has
made
that
that
is,
the
spending
clause
is
involved
here.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
necessarily
in
the
first
part
of
this,
although
the
language
is
mandatory,
but
i
think
it
could
do
without
that.
but
when
you
get
the
take
title
provision
it
has
no
choice
but
this
waste
is
given
to
it.
now
what's
extraordinary
about
this
legislation
is
that
the
federal
government,
as
to
a
good
part
of
its
radioactive
waste,
now
stuff
from
the
naval
reactors
and
that
low-level
radioactive
waste
is
not
the
state's
responsibility,
but
the
federal
government
has
actually
made
the
state
responsible
for
the
federal
waste.
it's
a
truly
extraordinary
law.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
tenth
amendment,
the
guaranty
clause.
i
mean
basically
we're
challenging...
no,
that's
the
basis
on
which
we're
challenging,
the
federal
system.
i
mean,
we're
not
trying
to
dissect
the
various
elements
of
what
makes
up
the
argument
that
the
federal
system
is
vital
to
the
constitutional
structure.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
it
can
do
that.
of
course,
yeah.
i
mean,
it
has...
and
it's
doing
that.
i
mean
basically
it,
the
nrc
controls
the
standards
by
which
you
regulate
radioactive
materials.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
it's
really
all
three
in
combination.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
the
worst
part
of
it
is
really
being
responsible,
being
liable
for
anything
that
may
happen
if
we
don't
take
it.
this
is
a...
our
obligation
in
this
can
run
for
5
centuries.
i
mean,
we
think
that
that
is
a
responsibility
that
should
remain
with
the
generator
of
the
radioactive
waste.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
has
generated
some
of
this
waste
we
are
not
saying
that
we're
not,
we
wouldn't
be
liable,
but
we're
saying
it
shouldn't
be
foisted
on
us,
the
rest
of
the
liability.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
have
no
idea
how
we...
well,
yes,
that's
why
we're
here
in
court.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
suppose,
sure,
but,
i
mean,
but
that's
again
telling
us
we
have
to
do
something,
then
we
would
have
to
do
the
regulatory
scheme
that
justice
scalia
was
asking
about.
so
it's
one
way
or
the
other.
we
have
been
conscripted,
commandeered
to
do
the
federal
government's
regulation
here.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that's
right,
but
it's
a
form
of
regulating
because
once
we
have
it
eventually
we
would
have
to
do
something
with
it.
and
as
justice
white
points
out,
that
the
government
can
require
people
who
are
the
owners
of
it
to
deal
with
it,
so
that
that
puts
us
in
that
category
and
we
can't
avoid
it.
we
are
stuck.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
that
was
a
question
that
we
had
thought
about.
if
this
starts
i
think
it
leads
us
down
that
path.
it
can
require
the
state
to
have
beds
for
all
people
of
a
particular
illness
by
some
date,
and
if
they
don't
have
it
provide
a
suit
to
let
people
who
haven't
been
given
a
bed,
we'll
say
cancer
patients,
to
sue
the
state
for
that.
i
mean,
it's
a
radical
change
of
the
federal
structure,
and
we
certainly
hope
that
the
court
will
agree
with
us.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
have
nothing
further
absent
questions
from
the
court,
your
honor.
