justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
asking
that
ferc
be
overruled?
i
see
you're
about
to
get
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
underlying
values
that
you're
trying
to
further
by
the
tenth
amendment
argument
that
you
urge
upon
us?
is
it,
is
this
simply
just
a
matter
of
etiquette
and
form,
the
etiquette
of
federalism,
or
is
there
something
more
substantial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
so
that
the
states
can
be
held
accountable
to
their
own
political
constituencies
for
the
results
they
reach?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
the
state
would
be
any
less
clear
in
the
responsibility
it
had
to
its
constituencies
if
the
federal
government
had
enacted
the
statute
such
as
justice
o'connor
proposed
earlier,
that
no
nuclear,
no
nuclear
waste
could
be
shipped
out
of
a
state
unless
all
of
these
conditions
are
met?
it
seems
to
me
what
the
state
has
done
here,
or
what
the
federal
government
has
done
here
at
least
makes
it
clear
who
bears
the
responsibility
for
this
scheme
of
regulation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
my
problem
is
that
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
the
federal
government
just
sat
down
for
a
bit
with
a
pencil
and
paper
it
could
devise
some
sort
of
constitutional
scheme
to
accomplish
precisely
this
result.
so
i
wonder
what
the
underlying
value
served,
that
is
being
served
by
our
accepting
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
had
47
votes
going
in,
i'm
sure.
[laughter]
isn't
it
true,
mr.
wallace,
or
is
it,
that
this
statute
is
a
step
further
than
the
congress
has
ever
gone
in
that
it
is
telling
a
state
that
it
must
enact
a
certain
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
it
says
the
state
shall
take
title.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
we
begin
by
saying
that
there
is
no
direct
precedent
for
an
enactment
of
this
kind?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
federal
government
command
that
the
states
take
title
to
all
illegal
handguns
within
their
borders
and
be
responsible
for
the
damages
caused
by
failing
to
take
title
and
possession?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
generically
it's
the
same
kind
of
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
deal
breaker
you
mean
the
enactment
would
not
have
succeeded
if
they
had
not
used
this
particular
device?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
that's
the
import
of
your
question,
then
this
case
does
have
great
significance,
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
like
the
poor.
they
all
have
an
equal
right
to
be
disappointed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
is
somewhat
surprising
that
the
state
of
washington
and
south
carolina
and
nevada
are
arguing
that
the
federal
government
has
the
right
to
direct
them
to
enact
a
law
and
direct
them
to
take
a
governmental
action
without
conditioning
it
the
way
it's
often,
the
way
it's
usually
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
very
surprising.
