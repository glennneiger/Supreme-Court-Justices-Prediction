mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
second
case
this
term,
arkansas
against
oklahoma
being
the
first,
concerning
federal
legislation
addressed
to
problems
arising
from
the
transmission
of
pollutants
across
state
lines.
in
itself
the
waste
disposal
problem
congress
faced
pitted
states
against
states
in
a
manner
only
congress
could
resolve.
the
three
states
that
had
sites
could
not
discriminate
against
wastes
originating
out-of-state,
the
other
states
lacked
incentive
to
develop
additional
facilities,
and
the
three
sited
states
were
in
the
unfortunate
position
of
either
having
to
accept
waste
from
throughout
the
country
or
shutting
down
their
disposal
facilities
and
depriving
the
generators
within
their
states
of
disposal
facilities.
there
was
also
a
broader
national
concern
implicated,
and
that
is
that
the
problem
of
waste
disposal
must
be
solved
if
the
people
of
this
nation
are
to
continue
to
enjoy
the
important
benefits
of
the
technologies
that
generate
those
wastes.
there
are
millions
of
residential,
commercial,
industrial,
and
institutional
customers
who
get
their
energy
needs
from
nuclear
power
plants
licensed
under
federal
statute.
there
are--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
believe
congress
did
solve
the
problem
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
could
have
taken
that
route,
but
the
studies
done
by
the
national
governors'
association
and
others
who
were
expert
in
the
field
indicated
that
50
separate
disposal
sites,
one
in
each
of
the
states,
would
have
been
very
detrimental.
it
would
have
lost
economies
of
scale
that
were
important
to
the
maintenance
of
these
technologies.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
giving
the
state
a
choice
of
options
because
the
states
came
to
congress
and
proposed
that
congress
solve
this
problem
by
retaining
authority
in
the
states
to
provide
for
the
handling
of
the
low-level
nuclear
waste.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
only
if
the
state
doesn't
exercise
any
of
the
other
options
available
to
it,
some
of
which
involve
minimal
state
undertaking,
such
as
contracting
with
an
existing
disposal
site
in
one
of
the
compacts,
or
authorizing
a
private
contractor
to
develop
a
site
within
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
is
true.
this
is
a
novel
approach
to
a
problem
where
congress,
pursuant
to
a
unanimous
request
from
a
state
organization
representing
the
governors
of
all
50
states,
was
dividing
up
the
responsibility
for
handling
nuclear
waste
disposal,
where
congress,
the
federal
agencies
would
undertake
the
high-level
waste
responsibilities
and
most
of
the
responsibility
for
low-level
waste
generated
by
federal
generators,
and
the
states
would
retain
the
policy-making
authority
with
respect
to
the
locally
sensitive
issue
of
selecting
sites
for
disposal
of
the
low-level
nuclear
waste.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
can't
answer
that
question
definitively.
it
certainly
would
go
much
further
than
what
has
happened
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
take
title
provision,
which
we
don't
believe
is
even
ripe
for
decision
today
in
the
setting
of
this
case,
it
may
never
apply
to
new
york,
it
can't
take
effect
until
1996,
is
only
one
option
down
the
road
if
new
york
doesn't
undertake
any
of
the
other
options
that
are
available
here.
it
was
added
in
on
the
face
of
things
because
all
of
the
other
disincentives
would
fall
on
the
generators,
and
there
was
some
fear
that
this
might
impair
the
availability
of
the
technologies
that
are
so
important
to
the
country
and
that
an
additional
disincentive
would
be
useful
to
insure
that
the
states
would
do
something
on
behalf
of
the
generators
within
their
borders.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps.
we
refer
to
it
as
a
penalty
in
our
brief.
it's
part
of
a
series
of
incentives
and
disincentives
that
congress
placed
in
the
'85
act
after
the
1980
act
proved
to
be
too
toothless
to
get
the
job
done.
and
congress
was
relying
primarily
upon
the
political
clout
that
the
generators
within
each
state
would
have
as
the
burdens
would
fall
on
them
to
get
the
state
to
undertake
the
responsibilities,
and
this
was
added
as
a
final
possibility.
exactly
what
kind
of
sanction
or
penalty
it
is
is
really
subject
to
much
doubt,
which
is
another
reason
why
ripeness
principles
should
be
followed
here.
it
is
far
from
clear
what,
if
any,
actual
enforceable
liabilities,
enforceable
in
federal
or
state
court,
would
be
imposed
by
this,
given
the
clear
statement
rule
of
the
atascadero
case
and
other
questions
about
possible
implementation
of
this
provision
would
arise
when
and
if
it
ever
comes
into
play.
there
is
no
indication
that
new
york
will
ever
actually
be
subject
to
this.
it's
even
doubtful
whether
the
generators,
if
it
did
kick
in,
would
make
the
request
that
would
impose
this
on
new
york
because
they
don't
like
to
call
attention
to
themselves
in
ways
that
might
create
public
controversy.
there's
much
that
is
speculative
and
in
our
view
premature
about
the
complaint
concerning
the
take
title
provision
that
new
york
is
asking
this
court
to
use
as
a
vehicle
for
undoing
this
entire
statutory
scheme,
even
though
it
has
had
the
benefit
of
the
extension
of
time
for
disposing
of
its
waste
in
the
sited
states
and
the
payments
made
under
this
scheme
for
a
period
of
many
years
now.
and
i
might
point
out
that
most
of
the
amici
who
are
supporting
new
york
with
respect
to
this
issue
that
is
prematurely
presented
agree
with
us
on
the
severability
question.
and
if
i
may
just
say
a
word
about
severability,
the
answer
to
that
seems
quite
clear
to
us
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
the
1985
act
displaces
and
in
terms
repeals
the
1980
act
which
would
again
be
resurrected
if
the
1985
act
were
not
severable.
and
it
is
quite
apparent
that
congress
wanted
to
make
improvements
by
adding
incentives
and
disincentives
to
the
1980
act
and
would
prefer
the
remainder
of
the
1985
act
to
the
1980
act,
and
in
fact
the
1985
act
passed
unanimously
in
the
house
initially
without
the
take
title
provision
which
was
then
added
in
the
senate.
there
was
never
a
dissenting
vote
recorded
in
any
of
the
enactments
of
the
entire
1985
act.
and
like
the
1980
act
which
took
basically
the
same
approach,
it
was
signed
into
law
by
a
president
who
was
himself
a
former
governor.
so
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
this
enactment
make
it
singularly
implausible
to
think
of
it
as
an
attempt
to
aggrandize
federal
power
at
the
expense
of
the
states.
indeed
the
most
basic
provision
of
the
act
is
the
conferral
of
power
on
the
states,
acting
through
the
regional
compacts,
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
which
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
otherwise.
and
other
than
the
take
title
provision
which
is
not
ripe
for
review
in
our
view,
we
believe
that
the
provisions
of
which
new
york
complains
are
squarely
within
the
principle
of
south
dakota
against
dole.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
indeed,
for
the
reasons
i
stated
a
few
moments
ago,
that
otherwise
the
1980
act,
which
congress
and
the
national
governors'
association
all
had
found
unsatisfactory,
would
be
resurrected
to
replace
the
improvements
that
were
enacted
in
the
'85
act.
and
the
house
itself
had
unanimously
passed
the
'85
act
without
the
take
title
provision.
so
there
seems
little
doubt
about
what
the
proper
resolution
of
that
is
if...
congress
of
course
could
amend
either,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
it
would
prefer
to
start
with
the
'80
act
rather
than
the
remainder
of
the
'85
act.
but
we
think
that
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
was
adequate
to
the
task
in
the
manner
congress
went
about
this,
that
the
commerce
power,
as
augmented
by
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
allowed
congress
here
to
enact
this
measured
series
of
incentives
and
disincentives
to
redress
the
inequities
that
had
occurred
among
the
states
and
to
provide
assurance
not
only
that
those
inequities
would
not
reoccur
as
they
had
after
the
1980
enactment,
but
that
the
serious
threat
that
they
posed
to
important
national
concerns
would
not
be
threatened
again
because
of
failure
to
provide
sufficient
incentives
in
honoring
the
states'
request
that
they
be
allowed
to
exercise
the
regulatory
authority
here.
we
think
it
would
be
singularly
inappropriate
to
adopt
in
judicial
hindsight
some
kind
of
a
least
restrictive
alternative
approach
to
adjudging
federal
legislation
of
this
kind.
i
mean,
what
may
seem
a
reasonable
way
of
adding
something
to
the
deal,
such
as
otherwise
you'll
lose
your
highway
money
so
you
should
go
along
with
these
provisions
at
that
possible
expense,
may
well
have
been
a
deal
breaker.
enormous
effort
went
into
negotiating
and
enacting
this
legislation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
what
was
acceptable
to
the
parties
who
over
a
period
of
years
negotiated
a
compromise
between
the
sited
and
the
unsited
states
and
what...
is
not
always
apparent
in
hindsight
to
someone
who
didn't
participate
in
those
negotiations.
all
the
states
are
treated
equally
under
this
legislation,
and
all
had
a
vigorous
voice
in
the
congress.
this
is
very
unlike
cases
dealing
with
insular
minorities
or
cases
dealing
with
state
discrimination
against
out-of-state
commercial
ventures.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
very
different
from
the
state
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
cases,
where
somebody
who
is
not
a
vigorous
participant
in
the
state's
political
processes
is
affected
by
what
the
state
has
done
in
a
way
that
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
it's
in
settings
of
that
kind
that
the
court
has
said
that
the
judiciary
in
hindsight
is
to
see
whether
a
less
restrictive
approach
would
have
been
equally
effective.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
not,
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
not
severable.
this--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
argument
i'm
making
is
that
this
additional
disincentive
was
within
the
legislative
power
of
congress
to
enact
because
it
made
a
judgment
about
what
would
be
an
appropriate
grouping
of
incentives
and
disincentives.
and
what
might
not
be
necessary
and
proper
in
some
other
settings,
given
the
magnitude
of
the
legitimate
federal
concerns
at
stake
here
and
the
unanimous
requests
of
the
states
that
the
decision-making
authority
be
reposed
in
the
states,
this
was
a
necessary
and
proper
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
to
see
to
it
that
this
state
against
state
dispute
was
equitably
resolved
and
would
no
longer
threaten
the
availability
of
the
important
medical
research
and
energy
technologies
that
are
vital
to
the
people
of
this
nation.
that
is
our
submission,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
