justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
title
provision
originate
in
the
senate?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
senator
was
all
for
it,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
that
it,
you
know
that's
a,
just
a
dream
world.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
have
made
any
difference
to
you
if
the
congress
had
said
and
by
the
way,
we'll
pay
half
the
cost,
that
this
law,
that
will
be
foisted
onto
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
they're
ordering
you
to
do
it
and
they're
saying...
what
if
they
say
we'll
pay
the
entire
cost?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
this
is
just,
this
is
just
a
budget
problem
for
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
challenge
it
on
any
ground
other
than
the
tenth
amendment,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
congress
can
pass
a
law
that's
generally
applicable
around
the
country
that
says
if
you're
going
to
operate
a
waste
disposal
facility
you
have
to
do
it
in
the
way
we
prescribe?
