justice

scalia
mr.
schiff,
is
that
all
this
case
is
about,
that
congress
is
going
to
have
to
tie
new
york's
continuing
receipt
of
highway
funds
to
its
assumption
of
this
responsibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
trouble
for
very
little,
very
little
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
we
do
if
there's
no
legislative
history,
or
we
don't
think
any
of
it
is
very
convincing?
do
you
have
any
advice
for
those
of
us
who
might
find
that
to
be
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
decide
severability?
i
thought
we
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
simply
whether
the
statute
works
without
the
provision.
does
it
make
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wasn't
representing
the
state
of
new
york
anyway,
was
he?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
representing
the
people
of
new
york,
wasn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schiff,
is
the
state
obliged
to
regulate
under
this
law?
can
the
state
comply
with
this
law
without
using
any
of
its
governmental
powers?
justice
antonin
scalia
--taking
title
you
say
is
the
sanction
for
not
regulating
as
the
government
has
told
you
to
regulate?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
that
dilemma
that
the
three
states
that
had
waste
disposal
facilities,
that
they
confronted
of
either
shutting
them
down
so
that
even
they
couldn't
use
them
for
their
own
in-state
waste
or
else
having
to
accept
waste
from
everywhere,
congress
could
have
solved
that
problem
under
the
commerce
clause,
i
presume,
couldn't
it?
couldn't
it
have
allowed
those
states,
it
could
have
passed
a
statute
allowing
those
states
to
use
their
in-state
disposal
sites
only
for
their
own
nuclear
waste?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
rather
like
saying
that
30
years
in
prison
is
one
of
your
options
for
embezzlement.
you
can
either
embezzle
or
spend
30
years
in
prison.
the
federal
government
has
told
the
states
that
they
can
either
regulate
or
the
nuclear
waste
is
yours.
i
mean,
in
a
sense
it's
an
option,
but
don't
you
think
it's,
a
sanction
is
a
more
descriptive
term?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you're
saying,
mr.
wallace,
is
that
we
really
don't
know
whether
this
deal
would
have
been
put
together
without
this
provision,
and
therefore
if
we
find
it
invalid
i
guess
the
only
fair
thing
to
do
is
to
find
the
whole
statute
invalid.
that
seems
to
contradict
an
early
point
you
made,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
can
make
both
arguments
then,
though.
i
mean,
either,
you
know,
either
it
wasn't
an
essential
part
of
the
whole
deal
and
therefore
is
not
severable,
or
it
was,
in
which
case
the
argument
you're
now
making
is
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just,
that
was
just
a
regrettable
consequence
of
human
selfishness.
all
states
were
losers
in
garcia.
they
all
had
to
pay
the
higher
salaries.
here
some
states
are
losers
and
some
states
are
winners.
it's
not
at
all
surprising
that
the
winners
are
going
to
come
in
and
say
leave
everything
alone.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
fundamental
difference
between
this
case
and
garcia
in
that
when
this
statute
says
each
state
shall
be
responsible
for
providing
for
the
disposal
of
waste,
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
waste
generated
by
the
state
itself.
it
means
all
waste
in
the
state,
and
therefore
this
statute
cannot
be
complied
with
by
the
state
without
the
state
using
its
sovereign
powers.
the
federal
government
is
directing
the
state
how
to
exercise
its
sovereign
powers.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
put
it
that
way
if
you
like,
but
it
can't
take
responsibility
for
somebody
else's
waste
without
exercising
its
sovereign
powers.
and
that
was
not
garcia.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
it's
worse
than
garcia
in
that
respect,
not
better.
