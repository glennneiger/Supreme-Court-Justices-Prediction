justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
a
small
question
about
your
argument
directed
at
the
take
title
provision?
is
it
at
the
specific
shall
take
title
to
the
waste,
and
it
also
says
shall
be
obligated
to
take
possession
of
the
waste
and
shall
be
liable
for
damages
directly
or
indirectly
caused?
is
it
just
the
title
part
or
do
you
make
the
same
attack
on
all
three
obligations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
wouldn't
really
matter
to
you
if
you
didn't
have
to
take
title?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
a
way
you
can
avoid
that
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
way
you
can
get
a,
set
up
a
program
that
would
avoid
your
taking--
