mr.
schiff,
do
you
suppose
congress
could
provide
that
a
state
without
a
site
for
radioactive
waste,
that
no
shipments
of
radioactive
waste
could
be
sent
out
of
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
take
title
provision,
is
it
severable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
don't
you
think
congress
would
probably
have
enacted
this
law
absent
that
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
problems
were
so
acute
that
they
probably
would
have
passed
it
without
that
clause.
we
don't
know...
that
provision.
we
don't
know
exactly
where
it
came
from.
it
appeared
rather
at
the
last
minute,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
schiff,
i
suppose
there's
a
difference
between
offering
incentives
to
the
states
to
make
their
own
choices
and
simply
mandating
that
those
choices
be
made.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
suppose
that
finding
a
location
for
radioactive
waste
is
a
little
like
trying
to
find
a
location
for
a
prison.
we
all
think
we
need
to
have
these
locations,
but
no
one
wants
it
in
their
state,
their
community,
their
county,
their
city.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
and
large--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
those
are
pretty
few
and
far
between,
and
i
suppose
it's
not
very
attractive
to
congress
to
have
to
make
that
choice,
and
this
is
a
rather
clever
way
of
shifting
responsibility
for
making
the
choice
to
the
states,
which
is
politically
very
unattractive,
i
would
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
schiff,
it's
a
pretty
clever
scheme.
maybe
congress
can
just
require
the
states
to
take
over
a
pro
rata
share
of
the
national
debt
they
have
run
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
whether
the
take
title
provision
is
valid
and
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
it
is
indeed
ripe
for
decision,
do
you
think
it's
severable
from
the
balance
of
the
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
collins,
i
just
don't
see
any
way
to
draw
the
line
that
you
would
have
us
draw
on
behalf
of
those
three
states.
i
can't
believe
that
the
state
of
washington
or
south
carolina
or
nevada
would
be
in
here
arguing
that
congress
would
have
the
right
to
shift
off
part
of
the
national
debt
or
shift
off
all
medical
costs
by
congressional
feat
to
the
states,
or
any
other
of
the
potential
schemes
that
this
would
open
up.
i
can't
believe
you'd
be
here
making
that
argument.
would
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then
how
do
you
justify
it
here,
because
it's
a
principle
we
have
to
deal
with,
not
some
individual
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
i
suppose
everyone
would
agree
that
we
need
to
solve
the
problem
of
medical
care
of
the
indigent
and
we
need
to
solve
crime
and
we
need
to
solve
prison
space,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
come
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
to
encourage
the
states
to
attain
regional
self-sufficiency
in
the
disposal
or
radioactive
waste,
congress
enacted
the
low
level
radioactive
waste
policy
amendments
act
of
1985.
the
act
includes
three
sets
of
incentives
to
encourage
the
states
toward
this
goal.
the
first
is
monetary
grants.
the
second
is
permission
to
deny
access
to
waste
from
other
states.
and
third,
should
a
state
not
achieve
self-sufficiency
in
the
disposal
of
radioactive
waste
by
1996,
a
requirement
that
the
state
take
title
to
always
generate
it
within
the
state.
petitioners,
the
state
of
new
york
and
two
of
its
counties,
filed
this
suit
to
obtain
a
declamatory
judgment
that
the
act
is
inconsistent
with
the
tenth
amendment.
the
district
court
found
the
act
constitutional
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
while
the
constitution
empowers
congress
to
hold
out
incentives
to
the
states
in
order
to
urge
the
states
to
regulate
in
accordance
with
federal
interest,
the
constitution
does
not
authorize
congress
to
mandate
directly
that
state
governments
regulate
in
a
particular
way.
applying
this
principle
to
the
three
challenged
provisions
of
the
act,
we
hold
that
the
first
two
are
permissible
methods
of
encouragement
but
the
third,
the
requirement
that
the
states
take
title
to
the
waste,
is
a
direct
mandate
to
the
states
that
exceeds
the
authority
of
congress.
the
take
title
provision
is,
therefore,
inconsistent
with
the
tenth
amendment's
reservation
to
the
states
of
those
powers
not
delegated
by
the
constitution
to
congress.
while
a
shortage
of
disposal
sites
for
radioactive
waste
is
a
pressing
national
problem,
it
is
one
that
may
be
addressed
by
congress
in
any
number
of
ways
that
do
not
require
state
governments
to
implement
federal
legislation.
this
provision
is
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
act,
however.
so,
the
rest
of
the
act
may
remain
enforced.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
have
joined;
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
