chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-543,
new
york
v.
united
states,
91-558,
the
county
of
allegany
v.
united
states,
91-563,
the
county
of
cortland
v.
united

mr.
schiff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
exactly
does
this
act
of
congress
violate
the
tenth
amendment
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
where
congress
regulates
a
state-owned
railroad?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
congress
just
included
states
among
the
people
it
was
regulating
for
carrying
on
a
certain
activity
and
it
didn't
single
out
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it's
the
state
of
new
york
deciding
in
this
case
and
not
allegany
and
cortland
counties
deciding,
i
guess.
they
might
have
different
views.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
tenth
amendment
that
protects
the
counties
from
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
schiff.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
collins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
what
you
mean,
mr.
collins,
that
as
a
matter
of
arguments
before
this
court
the
states
are
not
all
on
one
side,
not
that
the
statute
doesn't
pit
federal
power
against
state
power?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
mr.
schiff,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-543,
new
york
against
the
united
states
and
companion
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
