mr.
william
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
framing
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
three
sovereign
states
i
represent
and
then,
because
there
were
several
questions
about
the
implications
of
overruling
garcia,
i'd
like
to
address
the
point
that
even
if
this
court,
that
this
case
does
not
hinge
on
a
broad
interpretation
of
garcia.
like
new
york,
the
sovereign
states
of
washington,
south
carolina,
and
nevada
have
a
strong
interest
in
state
sovereignty
and
in
the
tenth
amendment,
but
this
case
is
unlike
any
of
the
other
tenth
amendment
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court.
one
of
the
obvious
differences
is
this
does
not
pit
federal
power
against
state
power.
indeed
south
carolina,
nevada,
and
washington
intervened
in
this
case
to
support
this
action.
and
when
you
have
looked
at
the
amicus
briefs
you
have
seen
that--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
indeed,
your
honor.
but
my
point
is
that
i
think
if
you
look
at
national
league
of
cities,
garcia,
hodel,
you
would
not
find
states
here
advocating
that
the
statute
was
valid.
that
difference
in
opinion
doesn't
mean
that
it's
valid,
but
it's
an
indication
that
this
is
a
different
kind
of
case.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
why
this
is
a
different
kind
of
case.
new
york--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
first,
justice--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
surprising
at
all.
this
case
involves
an
inherent
classic
kind
of
interstate
conflict
between
the
states.
some
states,
like
new
york,
generate
a
lot
of
nuclear,
low-level
nuclear
waste.
they
don't
want
to
store
it
in
new
york.
other
states,
like
washington,
south
carolina,
and
nevada,
have
tried
to
deal
with
that
problem.
we
have
sites
in
our
states
to
take
care
of
this
waste.
but
as
a
result
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
this
court's
decision
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
we
have
no
option
but
to
take
waste
from
all
the
other
states
that
choose
to
send
it
to
us,
or,
or
close
down
the
site.
now
this
conflict
is
exactly
the
thing
that
separates
this
case
from
the
other
kinds
of
cases
where,
as
justice
scalia
said,
all
the
states
are
losers.
in
this
case
states
that
try
to
be
responsible
in
dealing
with
their
waste
are
losers
and
the
other
states
can
take
advantage
of
them.
mr.
william
b.
collins
no.
indeed
we
would
not.
and
we're
not--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--that's
right.
and
i
think
that
this
law
meets
the
kind
of
principles
that,
the
narrow
kinds
of
exceptions
where
the
federal
government
can
make
a
statement
to
the
states
and
involve
them
in
a
federal-state
cooperative
program.
and
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
even,
this
case
does
not
hinge
on
a
broad
reading
of
your
decision
in
garcia.
i
think
that
even
if
we
analyze
this
in
light
of
the
dissenting
opinions
in
garcia
that
this
particular
enactment
would
be
valid.
and
let
me
do
that.
there
are
basically
two
dissenting
opinions
in
garcia.
one
was
authored
by
justice
powell,
and
justice
powell
focused
on
the
fourth
national
league
of
cities
test
to
look
to
see
whether
the
federal
interest
is
demonstrably
greater
and
state
compliance
is
essential.
now
i
submit
in
this
case
the
federal
interest
is
demonstrably
great,
simply
because
nuclear,
the
nuclear
waste
area
is
something
that
the
federal
government
has
been
involved
in,
and
it's
a
problem
that
must
be
solved.
justice
kennedy's
handgun
example,
people
certainly
differ
about
whether
handguns
are
a
problem
or
whether
they
should
be
regulated.
but
no
one
here
is
saying
that
we
don't
need
to
safely
dispose
of
nuclear
waste.
mr.
william
b.
collins
but
it's
a
unique
concern
of
the
federal
government,
justice
o'connor.
the
second
point
that
i
would
say
why
there
is
a
federal
interest
is
that
this
case
involves
a
central
concern
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
that
was
something
that
justice
powell
focused
on.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
federal
government
through
the
commerce
clause
power
has
the
ability
to
have
a
wide
reach
and
deal
with
other
kinds
of
things.
this
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
commerce
clause
because
of
the
dispute
between
the
states.
when
one
state
acts
to
have
a
site,
then
other
states
are
relieved
of
the
responsibility,
and
that
inherent
conflict,
i
think,
means
that
the,
it
is
a
central
concern
that
the
federal
government
in
those
limited
states
can
make
a
kind
of
command
to
the
states.
also
i
think
state
compliance
is
essential
simply
because
you
have
to
do
something
with
this
waste.
it
needs
to
be
dealt
with.
mr.
william
b.
collins
it's
directing
the
state
to
take
responsibility,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
not
claiming
that
this...
i'm
talking
about...
i
agree.
mr.
william
b.
collins
the
states
are
not,
are
given
maximum
amount
of
flexibility
to
decide
how
to
do
this.
there
are
nine
compacts
that
have
been
formed.
the
states
have
a
wide
option.
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
before
i
take
my
seat
is
just
to
concur
with
counsel
for
the
government
that
if
the
court
finds
the
so-called
take
title
provision
invalid,
that
it
is
clearly
severable
from
the
remainder
of
the
act.
there
is
no
severability
clause,
but
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
severability.
it
passed
the
house
unanimously,
and
in
fact
the
act
would
operate
just
fine
without
the
so-called
take
title
provision
because
this
act
gives
part
of
the
power
of,
the
federal
power
to
the
states
so
that
the
states
actually
have
the
ability
when
acting
within
a
compact
to
exclude
waste
that
is
generated
from
outside
the
compact
region.
and
that
is
why
we
would
say
that
this
does
not,
is
not
detrimental
to
the
state
power.
in
fact
states
have
a
lot
of
autonomy.
they
have
choices
about
how
to
deal
with
it,
albeit
with
the
take
title
provision
they
must
be
responsible.
they
have
a
wide
range
of
options
of
how
to
deal
with
the
waste.
they
can
enter
into
compacts,
they
can
contract
with
compacts.
one
compact
can
contract
with
another
compact.
the
only
thing
that
they
are
prohibited
from
doing
under
the
take
title
provision
is
simply
ignoring
the
problem.
so
we
would
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
below
or,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
take
title
provision
is
invalid,
the
court
should
sever
that
provision
and
sustain
the
remainder
of
the
law
which
we
think
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
partnership
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government.
