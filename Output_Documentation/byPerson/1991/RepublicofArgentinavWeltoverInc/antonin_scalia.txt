justice
scalia
mr.
davis,
what
is
a
bonod?
is
that
an
acronym
for
something?
justice
scalia
they
just
made
up
a
whole
new
word?
it
doesn't
stand
for
anything,
bonod?
justice
scalia
mr.
davis,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
you're
saying
is
that
its
purpose
was
a
governmental
purpose.
you're
describing
the
reason
it
was
doing
it
and
so
forth.
but
the
statute
explicitly
says
that
the
character
of
the
activity
under
the
act,
whether
it
is
commercial
or
not,
will
not
be
determined
by
reference
to
its
purpose.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
commercial
instrument
here
and
we
don't
care
what
purpose
it
was
issued
for.
justice
scalia
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
commercial
act,
and
you
don't
think
it's
a
commercial
act
to
in
effect
guarantee
to
someone
else
the
payment
by
someone
who
is
purchasing
goods?
if
i
come
in
for
whatever
motive,
for
the
government
and
i
want
my
businesses
to
flourish,
i
come
in
and
act
as
a
guarantor
in
a
commercial
transaction,
that
is
not
a
commercial
act?
justice
scalia
making
the
pesos
worth
something.
justice
scalia
i
consider
that
guaranteeing.
justice
scalia
you
can
call
it
that,
but
in
fact
they
are
guaranteeing
that
these
pesos
are
going
to
be
worth
something
in
the
international
exchange.
justice
scalia
every
certificate
of
debt?
what
if,
what
if
the
united
states
decides
to
give
substantial
foreign
aid
to
another
country
and
we
issue
them,
that
foreign
country,
a
negotiable
instrument?
justice
scalia
that
a
commercial
act?
justice
scalia
so
you
do
look
just
beyond
the
face
of
it
to
see
whether
it's
a
negotiable
instrument
or
an
instrument
of
debt.
you
do
look
to
what
it's
being
given
for.
justice
scalia
you
know,
that
provision
of
the
act
that
refers
to
it
being
based
upon
an
act
outside
the
territory
of
the
united
states
in
connection
with
a
commercial
act...
and
that
act
causes
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states,
that's
what
you're
relying
on
there?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that...
there's
a
whole
line
of
conflict
of
law
cases
that
involve
jurisdiction
based
upon
the
effect
in
another
state,
and
it
usually
means
something
more
than
what
you're
describing,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
--i
wonder
why
you
don't
rely
upon
the
middle
of
the
three
bases
for
jurisdiction,
that
is
upon
an
act
performed
in
the
united
states
in
connection
with
a
commercial
activity
of
the
foreign
state
elsewhere.
the
act
of
default
occurred
in
new
york,
is
what
you're
talking--
justice
scalia
isn't
the
word
act
there
broad
enough
to
include
the
act
of
default?
justice
scalia
suppose
i'm
buying
potatoes
from
the
russian
government
and
i
pay
them
with
a
debt
instrument.
would
that
be
a
commercial
transaction?
justice
scalia
so
it
doesn't
depend
on
whether
it's
the
government--
justice
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
we
all
aren't
getting
into
purpose
to
some
extent.
i
mean,
it's
a
very
well
for
statute
to
say
that
it
doesn't
depend
upon
the
purpose,
but
i
really
wonder
whether
you
don't
have
to
get
involved
somewhat
in
the
purpose.
justice
scalia
the
purpose
here
is
commercial,
but--
justice
scalia
i
promise
you
i
didn't
get
it
from
there.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
the
government's
point
is
sort
of
an
a
fortiori
point.
it's
very
rare
that
you
would
have
enough
contact
with
the
transaction
to
impose
your
law
upon
it.
that
is
to
have
legislative
jurisdiction.
but
not
have
enough
contact
is
simply
have
adjudicated
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
you
say
that
place
of
payment
is
usually
not
enough
under
long
arm
statutes?
justice
scalia
if
i
make
a
contract
that's
payable
in
a
certain
state
i
couldn't
sue
in
that
state?
i
couldn't
be
sued
in
that
state
for
failure--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
91-763,
republic
of
argentina
versus
weltover.
that
case
is
here
on
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
as
part
of
a
plan
to
stabilize
its
currency
the
petitioner,
republic
of
argentina,
issued
bonds
called
"bonods"
which
provided
for
repayment
in
united
states
dollars
through
transfer
on
the
market
in
several
cities
including
new
york.
at
the
time
the
bonods
began
to
mature,
argentina
lack
sufficient
foreign
exchange
to
retire
them
and
it,
therefore,
unilaterally
extended
the
time
for
repayment.
respondent,
bond
holders,
two
panamanian
corporations,
and
a
swiss
bank
declined
to
accept
the
rescheduling
of
the
debt
and
insisted
on
immediate
repayment
in
new
york.
when
argentina
refused,
respondents
brought
this
breach
of
contract
action
in
the
district
court
which
denied
argentina's
motion
to
dismiss
on
grounds
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
ruling
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
the
commercial
exception
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
of
1976
which
subjects
foreign
states
to
suit
in
united
states
courts
for
actions
taken
"in
connection
with
a
commercial
activity"
if
such
acts
"have
a
direct
affect
in
the
united
states."
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
in
light
of
the
established
meaning
of
the
term,
commercial,
under
the
restrictive
theory
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
which
the
statute
codifies,
we
conclude
that
when
a
foreign
government
acts
not
as
regulator
of
the
market,
but
in
the
manner
of
a
private
player
within
the
market,
its
actions
are
commercial
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
moreover,
because
the
statute
provides
that
the
commercial
character
of
an
act
is
to
be
determined
by
reference
to
its
nature
rather
than
its
purpose.
the
precise
question
is
whether
the
government's
particular
actions,
whatever
the
motive
behind
it
might
have
been,
are
the
type
of
actions
by
which
a
private
party
engages
in
commerce.
here,
the
bonods
are,
in
almost
all
respects,
garden-variety
debt
instruments
and
even
when
they
are
considered
in
full
context,
there
is
nothing
about
their
issuance
that
is
not
analogous
to
a
private
commercial
transaction.
accordingly,
we
conclude
that
the
issuance
of
the
bonods
was
a
commercial
activity
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
as
to
whether
that
commercial
activity
had
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
as
the
statute
requires,
since
new
york
was
the
place
of
performance
for
argentina?s
contractual
obligations,
the
rescheduling
of
those
obligations
necessarily
had
a
direct
effect
in
this
country.
money
that
was
supposed
to
have
been
delivered
to
a
new
york
bank
was
not.
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
direct
effect
requirement
cannot
be
satisfied
where
the
plaintiffs
are
all
foreign
corporations
with
no
other
connections
to
this
country,
and
we
also
reject
the
argument
that
the
direct
effect
must
be
substantial
as
opposed
to
merely
more
than
de
minimis.
these
limitations
simply
do
not
appear
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
for
these
reasons,
there
was
jurisdiction
over
respondent's
suit
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
