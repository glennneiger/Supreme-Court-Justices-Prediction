mr.
richard
j.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
we
are
addressing
today
involves
the
availability
of
u.s.
courts
to
dispute
between
two
panamanian
and
one
swiss
entity
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
government
of
argentina
and
its
central
bank
on
the
other
hand.
for
this
exception
to
apply
two
requirements
must
be
satisfied.
first
it
must
be
demonstrated
that
when
the
central
bank
financed
its
own
obligations
to
provide
dollars
under
a
foreign
exchange
rate
assurance
program
through
the
issuance
of
bonds
instead
of
supplying
the
promised
foreign
exchange,
that
the
central
bank
committed
a
commercial
as
opposed
to
a
sovereign
act.
second,
it
must
be
demonstrated
that
there
is
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
from
failure
to
pay
these
non
u.
s.
entities
when
no
united
states
person
suffered
any
financial
loss
and
the
united
states'
connection
with
the
transaction
is
that
under
the
bonds
new
york
became
the
place
of
payment
after
being
selected
by
these
plaintiffs
from
four
possible
choices.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
it
is
the
actual
name
that
was
given
to
the
instrument,
bonod
as
opposed
to
bond.
for
our
purposes
it
is
a
bond,
it
is
just
the
official
name
of
the
bond.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
it
does
not.
it
was
delivered
by
the
central
bank
as
one
of
two
alternative
instruments.
they
had
a
bonod
and
a
promissory
note
in
1982
when
the
central
bank's
obligation
had
matured
under
a
program
that
it
had
implemented
in
1981
to
provide
foreign
exchange
at
a
fixed
exchange
rate.
this
was
part
of
the
central
bank's
primary
functions
because
when
we
talk
about
the
argentine
central
bank
we
are
talking
about
a
classic
central
bank
in
the
sense
that
it's
explicitly
prohibited
from
participating
in
commercial
enterprises,
and
one
of
its
primary
responsibilities
is
the
issuance,
regulating
the
foreign
exchange
markets,
determining
how
foreign
exchange
should
be
allocated,
establishing
foreign
exchange
rates
and
policies,
and
providing
counsel
in
those
areas
to
the
republic.
in
1981
the
government,
the
central
bank
created
a
program
where
for
new
and
renewed
loans
it
fixed
through
a...
use
of
a
specified
formula
the
exchange
rate
that
would
be
used
when
these
various
debts
matured.
it
did
this
to
provide
a
cut
off
of
credit
to,
foreign
credit
to
argentina
because
of
the
rapid
and
unpredictable
devaluation
of
the
argentine
currency.
when
the
central
bank's
obligation
under
this
1981
program
matured
and
it
was
obligated
to
provide
dollars
to,
as
the
foreign
exchange
in
connection
with
its
functioning
as
the
government's
responsible
agent
for
foreign
exchange,
it
didn't
have
the
necessary
reserves
and
thus
what
the
central
bank
did
is
it
issued
two
types
of
instruments,
the
promissory
note
and
the
issue,
the
instrument
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
bonod.
in
considering
the
first
issue,
therefore,
whether
the
central
bank's
issuance
of
the
bonod
was
commercial
or
sovereign,
we
have
an
instrument
with
the
following
characteristics.
one,
it
was
issued
by
the
central
bank.
it
did
not
finance
the
acquisition
of
any
goods.
it
in
of
itself
raised
no
money.
it
financed,
as
i
said
before,
the
central
bank's
own
obligation
under
the
1981
foreign
exchange
rate
program.
and
unlike
the
promissory
note
which
i
referred
to
as
the
other
instrument
that
was
issued
roughly
contemporaneously
with
the
bonod,
it
contained
no
language
purporting
to
submit
to
jurisdiction
anyplace.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
but
it
was
doing
it
not
as...
you
know,
sometimes
some
of
the
legislative
history
talks
to
in
terms
of
entering
the
commercial
marketplace.
it
was
doing
it
by--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--yes,
but
it
was
doing
it
in
implementing
a
basic
sovereign
function,
that
is
exchange
rate
policy.
the
united
states
government
or
other
governments
may
do,
undertake
a
variety
of
actions
which
facilitate
on
a
broad
base
their
citizens
to
participate
in
markets.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
not,
not
anything,
but
i
do
think
that
a
kind
of
program
that
goes
to
where
the
courts
have,
in
looking
at
foreign
exchange
have
recognized
that
the
regulation
of
foreign
exchange
markets
are
one
of
the
core
official
responsibilities
that...
and
if
you
look
at
this
transaction,
what
it
was
doing
is
it
was
obligated
to,
as
one
of
its
responsibilities,
to
provide
foreign
exchange.
it
came
the
time
to
provide
the
foreign
exchange,
it
lacked
the
necessary
reserves,
and
what
it
did
is
it
just
substituted
the
bonod
for
the
foreign
exchange.
we
would
say
if
the
government
had
issued
the
foreign
exchange
that
would
be
doing
what
the
government
does,
issuing
the
foreign
exchange,
provide
the
foreign
exchange.
it
couldn't
do
that.
it
issued
the
bonod.
we
think
that
the
nature
of
that
activity
is
still
the
same.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
no,
i
think
it
was,
justice
souter,
creating
a
foreign
exchange
structure.
it
wasn't,
as
a
private
party
might
do,
picking
and
choosing
transactions,
evaluating
transactions.
it
was
in
a
sense
in
1981
created
an
entitlement,
if
loans
met
certain
criteria
you
would
get
this
future,
this
exchange
rate
at
a
promised
rate
in
the
future.
so
i
think
it's
that
kind
of
program
which
is
really
more
what
a
sovereign
would
do
than
what
a
private
party
would
do.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
we
think
that
the
reason
we
think
we
are
looking
at
the
nature
is
because
what
we're
saying
is
that
when
the
statute,
as
you
point
out,
says
you
should
look
at
the
nature
of
the
activity,
it's
not
saying
that
you
should
look
at
the
nature
of
some
abstract
activity.
it's
saying
you
should
look
at
the
nature
of
the
specific
activity.
for
us
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
inquiry
where
you
say
it's
debt
and
therefore
all
debt
is
by
nature
commercial.
this
debt
was
issued
in
terms
of
without
receiving
any
money
in
return.
it
was
issued,
you
know,
not
for
raising
money.
it
was
issued
without
financing
goods,
and
it
was
issued
for
purpose
of
financing
the
own
obligation.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
i
think
it
could
be
considered
a
commercial
act
if
it
was
guaranteeing.
under
this
program
it
was
not
guaranteeing,
because
the
normal
credit
responsibility
remained
upon
the
private
sector
borrower.
what
i
mean
by
that
is
the
private
sector
borrower
was
still
required
to
provide
the
pesos.
all
that
the
government
did
was
assume
the
responsibility
for
what
its
sovereign
function
was,
which
was
to
issue
the
foreign
exchange.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
in
terms--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--i
consider
it
fulfilling
the
foreign
exchange
responsibility.
i
also
say--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--through
doing
what
the
central
bank
does.
i
also
think
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
definition
when
it
says
look
at
the
nature
of
activity
we
believe
doesn't
require
or
support
looking
at
the
nature
of
an
abstract
activity.
i
think
there
are
two
other
things
that
are
relevant
in
the
legislative
history.
one
is
that
there's
a
lot
of
reference
in
the
various
briefs
and
some
of
the
cases
is
that
the
criteria
is
whether
a
private
party
could
do
something.
and
when
you
read
some
of
the
cases
in
the
other
briefs,
if
it
could
do
something
it
is
automatically
considered
commercial.
if
you
actually
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
that
is
cited,
however,
is
what
it
says
is
if
a
private
party
might
do
something,
then
it
could
be
considered
commercial,
not
would
automatically.
i
think
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
house
report
would
say
in
that
circumstances
it
could
be,
not
automatic.
the
other
reference
that
is
often
used
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
is
borrowing
money
would
be
an
example
of
a
commercial
activity,
and
what
we
would
say
is
that
the
commercial
activity,
excuse
me,
that
here
that's
why
we
look
not
to
some
broad
based
rule,
because
we
understand
that
in
the
overwhelming
percentage
of
the
cases
the
issuance
of
debt
is
going
to
be
a
commercial
act.
we
also
understand
that
in
a
gray
area
you're
going
to
have
a
circumstance
where
parties
can
and
do
secure
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
that's
going
to
be
the
circumstances
in
reality.
what
we're
saying,
however,
is
where
you
have
an
instrument
in
which
the
central
bank
through
the
issuance
of
the
bonods
raised
no
money,
financed
no
goods,
no
acquisition
of
goods,
and
at
the
same
time
was
financing
its
own
obligation
to
provide
foreign
exchange,
that
the
nature
of
that
is
a
sovereign
act
and
not
a
commercial
act.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
there
would
be
an
issue,
and
i
think
there
is
some
learning
in
the
second
circuit
which
we
do
not
necessarily
subscribe
to
which
would
make
it
difficult
in
the
allied
bank
case.
we
do
think
that
this
was
an
official
act,
this
was
an
act
of
the
state
by
the
government
of
argentina.
that
could
be
one
of
the
defenses
raised,
but
it
would
be,
we
would,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
second
circuit,
be
faced
with
the
allied
bank
decision
which
would
foreclose
that
in
terms
of
our
argument
until
we
got
to
this
court.
before
leaving
the
commercial
activity
aspect
and
going
to
the
second
point,
i
just
want
to
point
out
sort
of
our
analysis
that
i
think
is
consistent
with
what
the
courts
have
done
when
they
have
looked
for
example
at
the
contract
cases,
where
they
have
said
a
contract
of
employment,
yes,
that
is
something
private
parties
do,
but
if
it's
the
employment
of
a
diplomat
in
the
united
states,
that
would
be
sovereign.
if
it's
employment
of
somebody
else
to
perform
a
commercial
function,
then
that
would
be
commercial.
and
they
just
don't
look
at
the
last
act,
they
look
to
see
what
the
real
nature
is.
and
we
think
that
that's
also
the
position
the
government
took
not
in
this
case,
the
u.s.
government
took
not
in
this
case
but
took
in
the
izvestia
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
it
argued
that
you
had
to
look
beyond
the
fact
that
izvestia
was
a
newspaper
and
look
to
that
its
nature
as
the
official
organ.
but
the
second
leg
is
also
important
in
this
dispute
because
in
enacting
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
it
is
also
clear
that
the
congress
didn't
want
to
convert
our
courts
into
international
courts
of
claims
and
allow
disputes
to
be
heard
here
by
people
with
no...
where
the
plaintiffs
had
no
meaningful
connection
with
the
united
states.
it
did
this
by
creating
the
direct
effect
nexus
requirement
which
required
some
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
from
the
sovereign's
commercial
act
even
if
it
is
determined
to
be
commercial.
now,
the
government,
the
u.s.
government
and
the
respondents
urge
a
test
essentially
which
says
that
anytime
place
of
payment
is
in
the
united
states
and
it's
a
dollar
transaction,
that
is
sufficient.
they
essentially
urge
a
test
which
would
say
that
if
an
algerian
state
enterprise
purchased
machinery
from
a
private
tunisian
company
next
door,
that,
and
they
happened
to
have
dollar
payment,
therefore
it
provided
for
a
promissory
note
to
be
paid
in
the
united
states,
that
u.s.
courts
should
hear
that
dispute.
we
believe
that
you
need
go
no
further
than
the
language
of
the
statute
which
requires
that
the
direct
effect
be
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
determine
that
this
proposition
is
erroneous
and
that
the
proper
approach
would
require
that
the
place
of
payment
be
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
plaintiff
be
a
u.s.
person.
because
where
there's
a
great
weight
attributed
by
the
amicus
and
the
respondents
to
this
sole
connection
which
is
the
place
of
payment,
and
while
they
have
built
it,
tried
to
build
it
up
in
their
briefs
by
talking
in
terms
of
that
you
actually
paid
there,
i
think
that
is
the
attributes
of
a
place
of
payment
is
that
you
do
pay
there.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
i
think
that
it
would
require--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--i
think
it
would
require
that
the
transaction
have
many
more
connections
with
the
united
states
than
mere
place
of
payment,
perhaps
if--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--i
think
the
place
of
payment
an
be
vitally
important,
but
place
of
payment
really
is
a
characteristic
of
the
transaction.
we
don't
think
it
creates
the
effect.
the
effect
is
really
some
tangible
consequence,
and
the
tangible
consequence
that
i
think
exists
is
somebody
lost
money
in
this
circumstance.
and
what
was,
the
money
was
here
lost
by
the
two
panamanian
and
the
swiss
entities,
and
that
that's
just
simply
not
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states.
we
do
think
that
perhaps
if
there
had
been
some
additional
activity,
some
negotiations
in
the
united
states,
that
perhaps
you
might
be
in
a
closer
case
where
the
direct
effect
could
be
satisfied,
although
obviously
if
you
reached
a
point
where
the
loan
agreement
was
executed
in
the
united
states
you
probably
would
be
dealing
with
a
different
provision
and
not
the
direct
effect
provision.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
i
think
that,
justice
souter,
you
refer
to
two
aspects
of
the
place
of
payment.
in
one
you
talked
about
the
means
of
enforcing
a
right,
and
i
think
those
are
two
different
things.
that
they're...
yes,
place
of
payment
is
one
provision
and
that
is
considered
important,
and
i
think
that
that
is
done
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties.
i
think
when
parties
focus
on
the
means
of
enforcement
they
focus
on
provisions
that
are
very
common
in
international
instruments,
that
is
actual
submissions
to
jurisdiction.
and
indeed
in
this
case
you
had
two
different
instruments
that
were
issued.
one
is
the
promissory
note
which
is
not
the
instrument
which
is,
which
these
parties
held.
that
contained
a
submission
to
jurisdiction.
you
have
on
the
other
hand
the
bonod
which
contained
no
such
provision.
so
i
think
that
when
the
parties
in
international
lending
transactions
do
want
to
focus
on
how
to
enforce
their
rights
and
enforce
their
remedies,
they
focus
on
choice
of
law
provisions,
which
is
not
present
in
this
instrument,
they
focus
on
submissions
to
jurisdiction.
they
don't
focus
on...
the
place
of
payment
i
think
is
more
for
commercial
convenience.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
no,
i'm
just
using
that--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--i
don't
necessarily
think
that's
correct,
because
if
you
look
at
the
bonod,
i
mean,
it
references,
you
know,
argentine
decrees
and
argentine
law,
and
while
the
promissory
note
does
not,
you
don't
use
it
to
interpret
the
language
of
the
bonod,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
instruments
were
made
available
at
the
same
time
and
that
therefore
parties
could
know
that
there
was
another
instrument
which
contained
explicit
submissions.
and
i
think
also
that
it
is
just
not
unusual
in
international
lending
transactions
for
parties
to
understand
that
the
vehicles
for
protection
when
they're
looking
to
where
they
can
sue
is,
involves
the
submission
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--one
possibility
is
argentina.
and
it
may
be,
and
i
think
this
court
has
frankly
recognized
in
the
sovereign
immunity
context
in
the
argentine
v.
hess
case,
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
they
have
no
remedy
because
they
dealt
with
a
sovereign
and
didn't
negotiate
appropriate
clauses--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--well,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
market
in
bonods
it
was,
you
know,
an
instrument
that
at
the
time
it
was
issued
it
was
issued
as,
to
go
back
to
the
first
point,
really
in
substitute
for
foreign
exchange.
i
don't
think--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--well,
i
think
that
whether
there
would
or
would
not
be
a
commercial
market
in
fact
for
an
instrument
that
doesn't
contain
submissions
to
jurisdiction,
i
think
doesn't
determine
the
expectations
of
the
party.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
it's
in
terms
of
yes,
i
think
it
makes
it
a
less
attractive
instrument
and
which
it
is
the
reason
why
there
was
much,
a
smaller
percentage
of
people
took
the
bonods
than
took
the
promissory
notes.
but
in
terms
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
going
back
to
the
statute,
i
still
don't
think
that
it
would
satisfy
the
direct
effect
requirement
which
is
still
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
the
direct
effect
requirement
is
satisfied
when
a
non
us
plaintiff,
because
we--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--and
we
think,
with
respect,
that
the
commercial
reality
is
that
the
parties
seeking
to
secure
the
protection
of
assured
places
to
bring
a
lawsuit
in
fact
demand
that
as
part
of
a
transaction.
and
that
was,
and
in
this
circumstance
that's
not
present
in
this
instrument.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
they
took,
they
took
their
chances
when
the
bonod
was
accepted.
i
think
that
also
that
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
points
to
the
fact
that
it
intended
these
nexus
requirements,
which
were
designed
again
to
prevent
the
united
states
courts
from
becoming
international
courts
of
claims--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--the
bonods?
mr.
richard
j.
davis
they
were
payable
in--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--payable
in
dollars.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
yes.
and
i
think
that
that--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--i
think
for
practical
purposes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does.
and
i
think
it
was
understood
that
when
it
was
payable
on
the
new
york
market
that
there
would
be
some
mechanism
for
payment.
if
you
designated
a,
meaning
if
the
holder
of
the
bonod
designated
a
bank
in
new
york
or
zurich,
that
you
would
have
an
ability
to
receive
the
funds
in
new
york
or
zurich.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
yes,
it
was
an
option
of
the
bond
holder.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
terms
of
the
direct
effect
test
that
the
position
that
has
been
articulated
here
in
terms
of
the,
by
the
u.s.
amicus,
really
confuses
jurisdiction
with
choice
of
law.
this
court
in
a
number
of
opinions
has,
when
it
considered
whether
there
would
be
jurisdiction,
has
made
a
distinction
and
said
that
the
fact
that
the
operation
of
the
center
of
gravity
or
other
tests
would
produce
a
particular
choice
of
law
does
not
mean
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
i
think
that,
justice
scalia,
if
you
look
though
at
the
way
the
courts
have
dealt
with
place
of
payment
cases,
the
general
jurisdictional
rule
under
the
long
arm
statutes
and
that
congress
did
reference
that
it
intended
essentially
to
be
treating
sovereigns
similar
to
the
way
they
would
be
treated
under
long
arm
statutes
under
this
provision,
would
be
the
place
of
payment
would
not
be
sufficient
to
reach
somebody
under
a
long
arm
statute
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
and
i
think
that
in
the
various
decisions
of
this
court
when
it
looked
at
the
choice
of
law
issue
it
really
said
the
choice
of
law
question
becomes
significant
when
the
party,
and
this
i
think
was
referenced
in
the
burger
king
decision,
when
the
party
agrees
in
the
contract
to
a
choice
of
law,
that's
something
that
is
when
it
is
more
significant.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
if
that
is
the,
if
that's
the
only
connection.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
where
they
tend
to
require
that
there
be
some
other
action
in
the
forum
state,
and
the
only
cases
that
were
cited
contrary
in
the
responsive
briefs
were
cases
where
at
least
the
plaintiff
was
in
the
forum
state
providing
some
interest
for
the
forum
state.
but
they
generally
require
something
more
than
just
simply
place
of
payment.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well...
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
j.
davis
well,
i
think
that
in
the
international
context
i
would
think
it
actually,
justice
souter,
would
go
the
other
way.
indeed
in
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court
in
asahi,
in
a
constitutional
context
when
it
felt
there
was
a
close
case,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
foreign
national,
albeit
not
a
government,
that
would
be
brought
into
the
united
states
was
considered
a
factor
against
jurisdiction.
and
the
fact
that
it
was
a
foreign
plaintiff,
while
maybe
not
decisive,
was
also
referenced
specifically
in
that
opinion
as
being
a
factor
against
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states.
so
we
think
that--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--i
certainly
do
not
agree
with
that
reasoning.
we
think
that
that's
not
the
kind
of
effect...
it
may,
you
know,
we
have
a
question
whether
that's
really
the
effect
anyway.
but
if,
it
certainly
we
would
say
is
not
a
direct
effect
within
the
contemplation
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
there's
an
opinion
that
was
originally
written
by
judge
weinfeld
in
the
verlinden
case
when
he,
at
the
district
court
level,
which
i
really
think
very
effectively
presented
that
position
in
much
more
articulate
terms
than
i
can.
finally,
in
terms
of
the,
just
very
briefly
on
the
notion
that
our
test
is
unpredictable.
we
don't
think
that
the
test
we
proposed
which
says
basically
that
you
require
that
the
place
of
payment
and
the
party--
mr.
richard
j.
davis
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
