justice
souter
if
we're
going
to
look
that
far
behind
the
surface
of
the
bonod,
don't...
that
its
ultimate
objective
was
to
finance
foreign
commercial
exchange
in
trading
relationships
between
argentina
and
other
parts
of
the
world?
justice
souter
it
was
doing
it
so
somebody
else
could
stay
in
the
commercial
marketplace.
justice
souter
is
anything
that
would
fall
within
that
broad
base
therefore
non-commercial
in
your
view?
justice
souter
but
it
had
issued
the
bonod
because
in
effect
it
was
trying
to
find
a
means,
or
it
had
originally
been
trying
to
find
a
means
of
standing
behind,
as
it
were,
the
private
trading
entities
of
the
country,
and
therefore
it
was,
it
had
a
rather
more
specific
purpose
in
a
more
specific
temporal
period
of
the
market
than
merely
creating
a
foreign
exchange
structure
in
the
general
sense.
justice
souter
mr.
davis,
doesn't
your
argument
sort
of
make
light
of
the
fact
that
when
there
are
transactions
between
parties
with
governments
whose
currency
is
not
accepted
as
foreign
exchange
that
the
very
fact
of
the
transactions
taking
place
requires
in
effect
an
enforceable
term,
such
as
the
place
of
payment
term,
and
a
means
of
enforcing
that
place
of
payment
term
where
the
parties
designate?
in
other
words
this
isn't
merely
a
kind
of
incidental
side
issue
in
these
transactions.
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
central
to
the
very
possibility
of
a
great
many
of
these
transactions.
and
if
you
accept
that
as
a
premise,
then
do
you
not
find
a
much
more
substantial
dimension
to
the
effect,
i.e.
the
refusal
of
payment
or
the
refusal
of
credit,
in
the
place
designated?
justice
souter
well,
i'll
grant
you
that
up
to
a
point,
but
you're
not
claiming
that
the
terms
of
the
bonod
are
governed
somehow
by
the
terms
of
the
note,
are
you?
justice
souter
all
right.
so
that
the
holder
of
the
bonod
is
not,
presumably,
unless
we
were
to
come
up
with
a
rule
which
you're
not
even
asking
for,
the
holders
of
the
bonod
would
not
look
to
the
note
in
order
to
determine
what,
what
they
may
enforce
and
where
they
may
enforce
it.
and
if
the
bonod
itself
contains
no
submission
to
jurisdiction,
if
it
contains
no
term
even
governing
the
point,
isn't
the
most
reasonable
expectation
commercially
that
in
fact
it
will
be
enforceable
in
the
place
designated
for
payment?
justice
souter
if
they
can't
sue
in
new
york,
where
do
they
have
to
go
to
sue?
justice
souter
they
go
to
argentina,
don't
they?
justice
souter
well
you,
in
that
case
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
very
bustling
market
in
bonods
if
everybody
understood
that
you
had
to
go
to
argentina
to
collect.
justice
souter
well,
if
we,
if...
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
do
not
accept
that
point,
so
that
we
are
going
to
treat
this
essentially
as
a
commercial
transaction.
wouldn't
it
then
be
true,
as
i
said,
that
there
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
market
if
one
had
to
go
to
argentina
for
it,
and
therefore
we
ought
to
look
to
some
commercial
expectation
in
determining
whether
in
fact
it
should
be
enforceable
in
the
place
designated
for
payment?
justice
souter
it's
a
pretty
good
pointer,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
oh,
well,
i
grant
you
that.
maybe
i
have
lost
my
point
in
my
questions,
but
i
mean
my
point
was
in
determining
what
should
be
treated
as
sufficiently
direct
it
seems
to
me
we
do
have
to
look
to
these
commercial
realities,
if
once
we
accept
the
proposition
that
the
transaction
should
be
treated
as
a
commercial
one
rather
than
as
an
act
of
sovereignty.
justice
souter
they
took
their
chances.
justice
souter
mr.
minear,
do
you
agree
with,
accept
the
answer
that
justice
scalia
got
that,
to
his
question,
that
if
a
bonod
or
any
instrument
had
been
issued
for
purposes
of
foreign
aid
that
that
could
be
considered
when
we
decide
whether
the
act
applies
or
not?
justice
souter
in
other
words
you're
saying
that
that
would
be
looking
behind
the
instrument
to
the
purpose.
justice
souter
i'm
sorry.
justice
souter
but
if
it
was
payable--
justice
souter
--so
that
you,
in
effect
you
don't
look
to
the
purpose
because
you're
answering
the
question
based
on
the
identity
of
the
payee.
justice
souter
well,
if
i
go
out
on
the
market
and
i
decide
i
want
to
buy
a
foreign
debt
instrument,
do
i
know
that?
can
i
find
that
out
without
looking
behind
it?
justice
souter
so
you're
saying
if
the
government
of
argentina
or
any
government
wants
to
take
advantage
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
all
it
has
got
to
do
really
is
to
indicate
on
the
face
of
the
instrument
the
context,
if
you
will,
in
which
the
instrument
is
issued
and
that
will
suffice.
if
they
don't
want
to
indicate
that,
then
it's
going
to
be
treated
essentially
as
a
commercial
instrument.
justice
souter
okay.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
distinction.
say...
i
thought
you
were
distinguishing
the
foreign
aid
example
on
the
basis
of
it
depends
who
the
payee
is.
you
said
a
private
payee.
but
what
if
the
payee
is
the
foreign
government?
justice
souter
--you're...
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
you're
saying
that
the
way
to
solve
this
problem
that
justice
scalia
and
i
both
seem
to
have
is
to
say
at
least
don't
look
beyond
the
instrument
itself.
justice
souter
if
it
says
this
is
a
potato
note,
that's
one
thing.
if
it's
payable
to
a
foreign
sovereign
and
this
is
a
foreign
aid
note,
that's
another
thing.
we
just
stop
at
that
point
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
souter
--mr.
davis,
your
cases
were
all
domestic
cases,
were
they
not?
justice
souter
do
you
think
the
analogy
between
domestic
cases
and,
domestic
cases
dealing
with
domestic
states
and
cases
dealing
with
states
and
the
international
foreign
states
in
the
international
community
really
are
a
good
authority,
because--
justice
souter
--let
me
just
tell
you
what
i
have
in
the
back
of
my
mind.
the
fact
is,
at
least
when
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
jurisdiction
as
between
two
domestic
states,
we
can
assume
that
there
is
in
fact
going
to
be
a
court
somewhere
that
can
deal
with
the
issue,
and
in
a
way
which
we
will
assume
would
be
commercially
effective
although
you
may
have
to
travel
to
get
there.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
of
this
transaction
indicates
that
that
is
an
assumption
that
is
not
necessarily
to
be
made
when
we're
dealing
with...
in
international
transactions.
justice
souter
i
guess
it's
safe
to
say
you
certainly
don't
agree
with
the
second
circuit's
reasoning
that
the
point
of
all
of
this
is
to
keep
new
york
in
the
driver's
seat?
