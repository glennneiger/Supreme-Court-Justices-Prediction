mr.
richard
w.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
argument
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
the
statute
says
that
a
commercial
activity
is
to
be
judged
by
its
nature,
not
its
purpose.
in
this
case
the
petitioners
issued
negotiable
certificates
of
debt,
and
there
is
nothing
uniquely
sovereign
about
going
into
debt.
private
corporations
do
it
all
the
time,
private
parties
do
it
all
the
time.
in
this
case
the
petitioners
decided,
for
whatever
reason,
to
take
the
step
into
the
commercial
marketplace
and
they
gave
up
some
of
their
sovereign
immunity.
the
petitioners'
argument
on
that
does
raise
some
rather
troubling
points.
the
first
is,
of
course,
that
it
violates
the
plain
language
of
the
act.
the
second
is
that
petitioners
talk
about
the
context
of
the
bonods.
that
is
their
word,
that
is
not
mine.
the
context
is
really
just
a
code
word
for
purpose.
and
one
of
the
difficulties
is
that
it
wholly
obliterates
the
idea
of
restrictive
sovereign
immunity
because
every
sovereign
is
going
to
find
some
public
purpose
ultimately
to
justify
whatever
acts
it
takes.
there
is
another
possibility
that
is
even
more
disturbing,
and
that
is
once
purpose
becomes
an
issue
the
petitioners'
position
is
essentially
mandating
that
u.s.
courts
become
evaluators
of
the
authenticity
and
the
efficacy
of
foreign
sovereigns'
internal
purposes.
the
act
says
don't
do
it.
just
look
at
the
nature
of
the
activity.
the
nature
of
the,
this
activity
was
just
like
anybody
else
issuing
a
promissory
note,
if
you
will,
or
any
kind
of
certificate
of
debt.
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
is--
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
--no,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
sovereign
transaction.
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
the
certificate
of
debt
that
argentina
and
its
central
bank
were
issuing
here
was
just
like
an
ordinary
commercial
certificate
of
debt.
it
is
not--
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
our
argument
has
never
been
that
because
it
is
a
contract
it
is
commercial.
our
argument
has
been
that
it's
a
contract
for
the
repayment
of
borrowed
money
which
can
be
held
by
any
private
individual,
and
since
it's
negotiable
the
only
restriction
argentina
put
on
it,
that
it
would
be
that
it
wasn't
held
by
an
argentine
citizen
or
by
someone
living
in
argentina.
the
question
of
direct
effect,
your
honor,
is
simply
a
matter
of
the
same
analysis.
what
did
the
petitioners
do.
well,
here
they
promised
to
pay
in
new
york.
and
if
i
may
assist
the
chief
justice
in
the
interest
payments
that
the
petitioners
did
make
before
they
defaulted
on
the
bonds,
they
did
wire
funds
to
a
new
york
bank
who
then
deposited
them
in
the
accounts
of
the
respondents.
in
at
least
one
payment
each
of
the
respondents
was
paid
in
the
united
states.
in
this
case
payment,
of
course,
was
not
just
a
part
of
performance.
it
was
all
of
performance.
it
was
100
percent
of
the
executory
performance
of
the
instruments,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
the
suggestion
that
somehow
our
people
have
to
get
a
waiver
before
there
is
a
connection
with
the
united
states
again
is
simply
an
idea
that
goes
beyond
restrictive
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
the
idea
of
sovereign
immunity
is
that
a
sovereign
may
be
brought
to
u.s.
court
against
its
will
because
of
the
nature
of
the
instrument
it
issues,
because
of
its
conduct,
and
of
course
because
of
the
direct
effect
in
the
united
states.
the
direct
effect,
we
have
said
right
from
the
beginning,
your
honor,
right
from
the
district
court
on
up
to
here,
was
that
there
was
a
expectation
of
payment
in
the
united
states,
in
new
york
city.
the
petitioners
promised
that
they'd
do
it.
they
didn't
do
it,
and
the
effect
was
felt
right
here.
the
example
i
believe
that
we
gave
in
our
brief
was
that
of
a
shipment
of
grain
that
had
to
be
delivered
to
new
york
city.
in
this
case
the
cargo
was
dollars,
and
the
respondent...
and
the
petitioners
just
didn't
do
it.
that
effect
in
new
york,
i
would
make
very
clear
to
the
court,
was
not
a
fortuitous
effect.
the
petitioners
were
the
ones
who
named
new
york
as
a
potential
place
of
payment
at
the
option
of
the
particular
bond
holder.
the
petitioners
keep
reminding
the
court
in
the
brief
that
the
bonods
were
not
negotiated,
that
is
the
terms
of
the
bonods
were
not
negotiated,
so
that
the
designation
of
new
york
as
a
place
of
payment
was
petitioners'
unilateral
choice
to
make
those
bonods
look
as
if
they
were
worth
something.
the
effect
was
certainly
foreseeable.
in
this
case
the
effect
was
exactly
the
petitioners'
act.
the
petitioners
didn't
want
to
pay
the
respondents
in
new
york
and
they
didn't,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened.
the
respondents
didn't
get
their
money
in
new
york.
the
effect
and
the
act
are
virtually
identical.
and
if
there
be
any
reason
to
have
to
repeat
it
once
more,
the
idea
of
the
act
to
the
effect,
that
line
is
as
straight
as
an
arrow.
and
as
far
as
we
can
see,
your
honor,
that's
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
would--
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
must
respectfully
disagree,
because
in
this
case
again
it's
not
as
if
argentina
just
picked
new
york
out
of
the
blue.
there
was
a
real
purpose
to
new
york,
and
there
was
a
real
purpose
to
making
the
bonods
an
acceptable
method
of
going
on
with
debt.
the
purpose
of
naming
new
york,
as
justice
o'connor
mentioned
earlier,
had
to
do
in
great
part
i
am
sure
with
the
act
of
state.
nobody
was
going
to
give
up
the
control
of
that
debt
to
argentina
so
that
any
kind
of
currency
regulation
or
any
kind
of
exchange
regulation
could
make
the
bonds
worthless
with
one
stroke
of
the
pen.
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
i
think
it
may
be.
as--
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
--i
think,
if
i
may
answer
justice
scalia's
question
first,
i
think,
your
honor,
as
an
advocate
i
may
not
be
able
to
make
that
argument,
although
we
have
thought
of
it.
and
that
is
i
have
not
raised
it
below
and
have
not
argued
it
below.
on
reflection
i
think
it
is
probably
a
very
good
argument,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
make
it
in
this
court
at
this
time.
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question--
mr.
richard
w.
cutler
--but
i
would
say,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
an
act,
because
it
does
regard
an
act
outside
the
united
states
with
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states,
i
think
if
you
require
a
breach
of
contract
to
be
some
kind
of
positive
act
that
pretty
much
takes
away
all
breaches
of
contract.
i
mean,
rarely
i
know...
i
mean,
someone
can
deliver,
i
suppose,
shoes,
and
there
is
an
argument
about
whether
the
shoes
are
up
to
the
quality
that
was
originally
in
the
agreement.
but
most
of
the
time
i
think
breaches
of
contract
are
in
fact
somebody
not
doing
something,
and
it's
the
not
doing
something
that's
the
act.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
bench,
i
will
retire
at
this
time.
