justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
davis,
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
and
conclude
that
jurisdiction
was
appropriate
here,
do
you
suppose
argentina
can
still
assert
on
the
merits
an
act
of
state
defense
in
the
litigation?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
davis,
i
take
it
you
take
the
position
that
a
foreign
corporation
can
never
sue
under
the
direct
effects
provision
in
the
u.s.--
justice
o'connor
--is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
place
of
payment
can
be
vitally
important,
can
it
not?
