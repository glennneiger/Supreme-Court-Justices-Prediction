justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-763,
republic
of
argentina
and
banco
central
v.
weltover,
inc.,
et
al.
spectators
are
admonished
to
refrain
from
talking
while
you're
in
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
davis,
let
me
ask
you
a
provision,
about
a
provision
of
the
bonods.
they
were
not
in
terms
payable
in
new
york,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
payable
in
dollars.
chief
justice
rehnquist
through
transfer
on
the
new
york,
frankfurt,
london,
or
zurich
markets.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
amount
to
saying
they
are
payable
in
new
york?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
was
at
the
option
of
the
bond
holder
where
the
funds
would
be
received?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
davis.
mr.
cutler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
ordinarily
speak
of
a
default
as
having
been
performed,
do
you?
i
mean
it
seems
somehow
more
positive.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
my
question
becomes
moot
if
you--
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cutler.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
too
is
kind
of
a
nexus
argument
that
we
might
expect
in
another
context,
i
think,
rather
than
its
strictly
an
interpretation
of
this
statute,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
observation
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
in
enacting
this
act
was
to
make
sure
that
new
york
city
kept
its
importance
in
the
financial
world?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
davis,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
