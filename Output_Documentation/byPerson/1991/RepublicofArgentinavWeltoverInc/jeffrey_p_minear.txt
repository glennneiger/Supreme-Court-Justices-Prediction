mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
submit
that
argentina
is
subject
to
suit
based
on
its
failure
to
honor
debt
instruments
that
it
issued
to
private
creditors
and
that
are
payable
in
the
united
states.
the
initial
question
here
is
whether
argentina
has
engaged
in
a
commercial
activity,
and
we
think
there
is
little
room
to
dispute
that
argentina's
issuance
of
bonods
is
just
such
an
activity.
as
argentina
acknowledges,
a
bonod
is
a
debt
instrument
issued
to
private
creditors
that
entitles
the
holder
to
repayment
of
principal
with
interest.
it
does
not
differ
in
its
essential
terms
from
a
bond
or
debt
instrument
that
a
business
corporation
might
issue.
when
argentina
issued
its
bonods
it
borrowed
money
in
the
international
debt
market
and
it
thereby
engaged
in
a
commercial
activity.
that
conclusion
is
especially
compelling
here
where
argentina
issued
its
bonods
as
substitutes
for
payment
of
preexisting
private
commercial
obligations.
at
bottom
argentina
really
does
not
challenge
the
commercial
character
of
the
debt
instruments.
rather
it
simply
argues
that
it
had
a
public
purpose
in
issuing
them.
as
the
lower
courts
correctly
pointed
out,
however,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
act
instructs
that
the
commercial
character
of
an
activity
must
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
its
nature
rather
than
its
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that
might
well
be
a
commercial
activity
if
it
was,
if
the
payment
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
commercial
debt
instrument
that
obligated
the
united
states
to
pay
money
to
a
private
creditor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
i
was
saying
that
we
look
to,
instead
to
whether
the
united
states
issued
a
debt
instrument
that
is
payable
to
a
private
party
and
that
requires
payment
of
money.
if
the
united
states
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--acting
in
the
same
manner
as
a
business
corporation
in
issuing
the
debt
instrument,
we
think
that
we
would
be
liable
to
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
we're
looking
to
the
character
of
the
instrument
in
which
the
transaction
takes
place.
we're
looking
to
the
character
of
the
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
you
can
look
to
the
instrument
itself.
and
here,
as
i
said,
this
instrument
was
issued
in
the
form
of
a
bond,
a
traditional
debt
instrument.
and
to
the
extent
that
argentina
went
to
the
commercial
marketplace
to
obtain
its
funds,
or
in
this
case
actually
to
delay
payment
of
funds,
it's
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
commercial
marketplace.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
essentially
that's...
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
government,
in
that
situation
i
should
be
clear
that
if
it's
a,
a
sovereign
to
sovereign
transaction,
and
i
am
thinking
in
particular
of
currency
swaps
between--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
likely
to
be
a
commercial
transaction
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
would
say
that
we
would
draw
an
exception,
however,
in
a
case...
for
instance,
the
central
banks
of
various
countries
will
engage
in
currency
swaps
to
maintain
liquidity
between
their
two
central
banks.
this
transaction
never
takes
place
in
the
market.
it's
simply
a
transaction
that
is
conducted
between
two
sovereigns.
it's
more
of
the
character
of
a
treaty
rather
than
a
commercial
contract,
and
that
is
the
example.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
some
situations--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
all
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
in
some
cases
it's
true
that
it's
difficult
to
determine
the
nature
and
activity
without
some
resort
to
purpose,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
this
case
here.
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
with
respect
to
debt
instruments
i
think
that
provides
a
very
workable
rule
and
it
also
provides
certainty
in
the
marketplace.
now
once
the
court
has
asserted
that
the
complaint
here
identifies
a
commercial
activity
the
next
question
is
whether
the
commercial
activity
has
a
sufficient
nexus
with
the
united
states.
the
lower
courts
concluded
that
argentina's
unilateral
rescheduling
of
its
debt
payments
caused
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
because
the
rescheduling
resulted
in
argentina
breaching
its
obligation
to
repay
a
debt
that
was
legally
obligated
to
pay
in
this
country.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
am
using
the
word
nexus
in
a
more
general
term
of
connection.
there
are
actually
three
types
of
connections
that
would
subject
a
commercial
activity
to
suit.
one,
if
it
takes
place
in
the
united
states,
two,
if
an
act
in
connection
with
the
activity
takes
place
in
the
united
states,
or
three,
if
there
is
an
act
outside
the
territory
of
the
united
states
that
has
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states.
now
in
this
case
the
way
that
the
respondents
have
structured
their
complaint,
and
they
are
masters
of
their
complaint
in
this
context,
is
that
the
commercial
activity
is
the
issuance
of
the
bonods.
the
act
outside
the
territory
of
the
united
states
is
the
rescheduling
of
the
debt
payments.
the
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
is
the
breach
of
the
obligation
to
pay
here.
now,
as
the
justices
alluded
to
earlier,
this
could
also
conceivably
fit
into
the
second
clause
of
the
provision,
particularly
if
you're
willing
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
and
the
house
report
that
notes
that
an
omission
can
be
treated
as
an
act
for
purposes
of
the
second
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
in
any
event
it's
true
that
these
three
clauses
do
overlap
to
some
extent,
and
that's
true.
but
we
think
that
this
case
fits
squarely
in
the
third
clause,
without
regard
to
whether
it
fits
in
the
first
or
second
clause.
now...
and
i
think
the
reason
for
this
should
be
quite
clear,
that
creditors
lend
money
in
the
expectation
that
they're
going
to
be
repaid,
and
the
choice
of
the
place
of
payment
is
central
to
their
expectations.
and
simply
put
it
is
the
place
of
performance
of
the
debtor's
contractual
obligation.
now,
when
a
debtor
breaches
its
repayment
obligation
it
has
a
direct
effect
at
the
designated
place
of
performance
because
that
is
where
the
breach
of
the
contract
takes
place.
thus
it
is
proper
to
conclude
that
argentina's
breach
of
its
obligation
or
of
the
bonods
has
a
direct
effect
here
in
the
united
states,
which
was
designated
by
argentina
as
the
place
of
performance.
now
this
is
also
consistent
with
conflict
of
law
principles
if
one
were
to
look
to
the
second
restatement
or
the
first
restatement
of
conflicts.
both
of
those
cases
indicate
that
the
applicable
law
would
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
place
of
performance
in
the
case
of
a
debt
transaction.
that
would
be
section
195
of
the
second
restatement,
and
section
370
of
the
first
restatement.
so
it's
hardly
odd
to
suggest
that
the
place
of
performance
shouldn't
also
not
be
the
significant
legal
effect
for
purposes
of
the
fsia
and
for
purposes
of
determining
jurisdiction.
moreover,
this
conclusion
reflects
the
realities
of
the
international
debt
market
where
the
party's
choice
of
place
of
payment
determines
the
value
and
marketability
of
the
debt.
an
international
debt
has
increased
risk
and
diminished
value
if
it
is
payable
at
a
location
where
there
is
political
upheaval,
currency
exchange
restrictions,
or
inadequate
resources
or
mechanisms
for
settling
the
debt.
in
that
case
of
the
example
that
mr.
davis
gave
of
a
transaction
between
a
tunisian
and
algerian
businessmen,
they
might
well
decide
that
the
place
of
payment
should
be
in
new
york
rather
than
in
tunis,
algiers,
or
perhaps
tripoli,
because
that
is
the
one
place
where
they
can
be
certain
that
the
rule
of
law
would
govern
their
transaction.
and
that
we
think
is
central
to
the
united
states'
interest
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
rule
of
law
does
apply
to
commercial
transactions
carried
out
in
the
united
states.
now,
when
a
foreign
state
makes
its
debt
instruments
payable
in
the
united
states,
united
states
currency,
it
is
purposely
availing
itself
of
the
stability
of
the
united
states
as
a
commercial
forum.
it
should
therefore
be
subject
to
the
forum's
legal
rules
which
preserve
that
stability
and
the
value
of
the
debts
that
are
payable
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
point
that
i
am
making
here,
that
the,
that
this
is
the
policy
that
underlies
the
direct
effects
test
and
underlies
its
application
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
we
have
to
rely
at
some
level
on
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
here,
which
was
to
make
sure
that
when
a
foreign
nation
enters
the
commercial
market
it's
subject
to
the
same
rules
as
other
parties
would
be.
now,
other
parties
that
made
debts
payable
in
new
york
would
be
subject
to
new
york
law.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
would...
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not
phrase
it
that
way.
but
i
would
say
that
congress
here
was
concerned
that,
in
the
fact
that
the
rule
of
law
would
apply
to
commercial
transactions
that
have
a
substantial
connection
with
the
united
states.
and
in
the
case
of
a
transaction
of
a
debt
that
is
payable
in
the
united
states
that
is
a
substantial
connection.
it
is
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
when
such
a
transaction
is
breached.
now
argentina's
approach,
which
would
require
a
court
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
a
foreign
state's
breach
by
examining
where
the
creditor
suffers
its
economic
loss,
would
produce
an
unpredictable
and
we
think
unworkable
standard
for
resolving
the
jurisdictional
issue.
that
is
particularly
true
in
the
case
of
negotiable
instruments.
under
argentina's
approach
a
foreign
state
would
be
unable
to
assess
its
own
immunity
or
its
own
amenability
to
suits
in
this
country
at
the
time
that
it
issued
its
debt
instrument
and
thereafter,
after
it
is
exchanged
to
other
persons
hands.
in
sum,
we
submit
this
case
provides
an
opportunity
to
state
a
clear
rule
applicable
to
a
broad
category
of
cases,
and
the
rule
should
be
this.
a
foreign
state
is
not
immune
from
suits
in
the
courts
of
this
country
if
it
breaches
a
contractual
obligation
to
repay
a
debt
instrument
that
can
be
held
by
a
private
creditor
and
is
payable
in
the
united
states.
that
rule
is
not
only
consistent
with
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
but
it
would
also
provide
definitive
guidance
to
foreign
states
in
structuring
their
debt
offerings
and
determining
their
amenability
to
suit
in
this
country.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
thank
you.
