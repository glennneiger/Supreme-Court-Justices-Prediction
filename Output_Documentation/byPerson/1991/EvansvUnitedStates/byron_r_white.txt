what
about
if
the
conviction
is
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
inducement
requires
more
than
just
acceptance
of
money
by
somebody
who
holds
an
office
that
if
he
acts
in
a
certain
way
it
will
help
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient
inducement
in
your
mind
if
someone
just
let
it
be
known
around
town,
or
if
he
just
solicited
money...
just
solicited
monies.
you
know,
i've
got...
i'm
in
a
position
in
the
government.
i
can
do
you
a
lot
of
good.
how
about
paying
me
a
little
bit?
and
he
doesn't
say
otherwise
i'll
oppose
you,
he
just
solicits.
that
wouldn't
be
enough,
would
it?
not
in
your
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
make
a
demand,
he
just
solicits.
and
he
doesn't
threaten
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
your...
they
didn't
even
need
to
put
on
under
color
of
official
right
under
your...
they
didn't
add
a
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
under
color...
what
did
it
mean
if...
i
mean
you
could,
under
your
provision,
it
would
cover
no
more
than
what
the
threat
of...
what
the
threat
language
would
take
care
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it's
a
specific
undertaking?
a
promise
to
do
something
for
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
only
if
it's
a
campaign
contribution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
he
isn't...
just
forget
the
campaign
contribution
for
a
little
while.
suppose
you
agree
that
he
doesn't
take
the
money
as
a
campaign
contribution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
he's
a
congressman,
or
he's
a
state
legislator.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
is
he...
does
he
commit
a
hobbs
act
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
says
if
you
don't
give
me
the
money,
i
will
oppose
what
you
want.
that
certainly
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
to
be
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
can't...
he
doesn't
violate
the
hobbs
act
if
a
constituent
comes
and
says,
i'll
give
you
$10,000
to
help
me
out
and
he
says,
i'll
take
the
money,
but
i
won't
promise
you
a
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
takes
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
not
extortion,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
was
laid
on
your
plate...
laid
right
on
your
plate
in
mccormick
by
justice
scalia.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
still
not
making
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
page
55?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
if
some
constituent
just
sends
in
$10,000
to
a
congressman
or
a
senator
saying,
i
know
you're
performing
great
services
for
the
country,
and
i
want
to
supplement
your
compensation.
and
the
fellow
takes
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you're
a
great
supporter
of
the
farmer,
and
i'm
a
farmer.
