justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
abbott,
you
said
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
that
you
concede
that
what
the
government
is
arguing
for
is
an
ancient
common
law
meaning
of
extortion.
is
that
the
ancient
common
law
meaning
of
it,
what
the
government
is
arguing
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
sheriff...
even
though
the
sheriff
told
the
person
he
was
letting
out
of
jail
i
know
i'm
not
entitled
to
this
money,
but
if
you
give
it
to
me,
i'll
let
you
out
of
jail.
that
was
extortion?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
have
been
called
under
color
of
right?
i
mean,
you've
been
arguing
about
the
text
of
the
statute.
this
doesn't
say
under
color
of
law,
or
it
doesn't
say
under
color
of
office,
it
says
under
color
of
right.
what
color
of
right
is
there
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
have
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
historically
beginning
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
beginning
in
'46
with
the
hobbs
act.
i'm
aware
of
some
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
went
in
that
direction,
but
i'm
not
aware
that
that
was
the
common
law
meaning
of
it
or
the
meaning
of
it
under
the
new
york
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
new
york
statute
was
fee
collection?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
fee
collection?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
claims
that
the
fee
is
in
fact
authorized
when
it's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
calling
that
under
color
of
right.
he
pretends
to
be
entitled
to
it
and
he's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
arguing
for
that
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait
a
minute.
it
wouldn't
be
extortion
under
color
of
official
right,
but
it
could
be
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
induced
by
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence,
or
fear,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
need
the
official
right,
except
the
reason
you
need
the
color
of
official
right
is
the
person
who
says
you
have
to
pay
me
this
money
because
i'm
entitled
to
it
does
not
put
anybody
in
any
fear
of
anything
at
all.
so
you
need
that
separate
section.
but
you
don't
need
it
for
the
situation
you've
just
responded
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
color
of
office.
that's
the
point,
it
does
not
say
color
of
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
said
color
of
office.
it
could
have
said
color
of
authority.
it
could
have
said
color
of
law.
it
says
color
of
right.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
just
so
blithely
ignore
criminal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
may
have
made
the
argument--
--this
may
be
your
last
chance.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
do
you
know
of
any
new
york
case?
i
looked
in
mccormick,
and
i
could
not
find
any...
could
not
find
a
single
new
york
case
that
involved
this
crime
of
extortion,
that
is,
under
color
of
official
right,
that
did
not
involve
the
classic
case
of
asking
for
money
that
you
were
not
entitled
to
by
your
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whaley
case.
that's
the
only
one
i
could
find.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
claim
of
official
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
think
that's
suspicious,
that
the
language
says
official
right?
and
the
only
case
you
can
find
under
it
in
fact
involved
a
claim
of
official
right
over
how
long
a
period?
it
was
an
old
law.
it
went
way
back
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
all
those
years,
the
only
prosecution
happens
just
accidentally
to
track
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
bribery
was
a
separate
offense
under
new
york
law,
wasn't
it?
bribery
was
not
reached
through
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
know
that
under
new
york...
and
i
say
the
only
case
i
know
of
involving
this
under
new
york
law,
is
that
one
case
that
you
mentioned.
and
what
i
also
know
about
new
york
law
is
that
bribery
was
a
separate
crime,
and
that
if
you
proved
that
the
payment
was
voluntary,
you
could
not
be
convicted
of
extortion.
that
was
the
great
divide
between
bribery
and
extortion.
if
it
was
a
voluntary
payment
it
was
bribery.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
it
not
make
sense
to
put
in
with
those
cases
official
extortion
in
the
very
narrow
sense
of
extortion
by
an
official
who
says
you've
got
to
make
the
payment.
i
won't
break
your
arm,
but
i'll
put
you
in
jail.
it's
a
matter
of
right.
i
have
a
right
to
this
payment
as
a
government
official.
it
makes
sense
to
put
that
in
with
the
arm-breaker.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
also
the
donor,
the
donor
is
not
picked
up
under
this
statute
either.
i
mean,
you
just
get
the
person
who
receives
it
for
the
extortion,
unlike
the
bribery
statutes
which
typically
get
both
giver
and
receiver.
