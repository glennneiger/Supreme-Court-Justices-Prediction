why
isn't
it
pertinent,
mr.
bryson?
our
statute
is
quite
different.
it
refers
only
to
obtaining
property
from
another
with
his
consent
under
color
of
official
right.
justice
clarence
thomas
it
doesn't
have
a
limiting
factor.
it
doesn't
say
in
excess
of.
so
why
isn't
the
$10
fee
extortion?
justice
clarence
thomas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
if
we
refer
to
the
hobbs
act--
justice
clarence
thomas
--the
term
extortion
means
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
under
color
of
official
right.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
i
understand
that,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
justice
clarence
thomas
but
you
will
admit
that
on
its
face
it
has
no
limiting
principle?
