mr.
c.
michael
abbott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
two
issues
presented
in
the
case
of
evans
v.
the
united
states
have
to
do
with
first,
under
the
hobbs
act,
title
18,
united
states
code,
section
1951
(b)(2),
whether
an
affirmative
act
of
inducement
by
a
public
official
such
as
a
demand
or
threat
has
to
be
shown
by
the
government
in
an
extortion
case
under
color
of
official
right.
the
second
issue
presented
is
whether,
in
the
absence
of
that
hobbs
act
conviction,
should
we
be
successful
here,
the
petitioner
was
properly
convicted
for
making
a
false
statement
on
his
income
tax
return
when
he
failed
to
report
a
$7,000
payment
given
by
an
fbi
undercover
agent.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
then
we
are
out
of
luck
on
count
two,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
one
count
of
extortion,
one
count
of
false
statement
that
was
affirmed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
september
of
1990.
briefly,
in
summarizing
the
facts,
in
march
of
1985
the
fbi
began
an
undercover
investigation
of
john
evans
that
was
to
continue
for
approximately
31
months.
they
were
investigating
allegations
that
there
was
public
corruption
in
zoning
matters.
the
agent,
the
fbi
agent,
posed
as
a
land
developer
who
was
new
to
the
atlanta
area.
they
first
met
with
evans
in
march
of
1985.
that
meeting
essentially
was
one
in
which
they
indicated
they
would
be
meeting
with
governmental
bodies.
evans
indicated
that
he
would
be
glad
to
assist
them
if
he
were
able
to,
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
recontact
them
after
that
meeting.
they
met
again
in
august
of
1985
and
the
scenario
is
much
the
same
except
that
that
particular
meeting
was
videotaped.
the
focus
of
the
investigation
began
or
it
began
to
heat
up
in
may
of
1986,
because
at
that
time
evans
was
running
for
reelection
as
a
commissioner
of
dekalb
county,
georgia.
and
if
elected,
it
would
be
his
second
term.
there
were
two
contributions
made
during
the
course
of
the
investigation.
in
may
of
1986,
in
a
meeting
with
the
undercover
agent
and
some
associates,
evans
was
asked
if
in
fact
he
needed
any
expenses.
there
had
been
previous
talk
of
campaign...
of
his
reelection
campaign,
and
he
took
the
reference
to
mean
campaign
expenses.
he
indicated
that
he
needed
expenses...
or
a
campaign
contribution
for
a
precinct
mailing.
they
gave
him
$300.
he
reported
the
contribution.
he
sent
a
thank-you
note.
he
made
no
attempt
to
recontact
the
agents,
and
in
fact,
he
spent
approximately
$300
that
month
for
his
precinct
mailing.
he
was
not
charged
for
that
particular
event.
the
focus
of
this
particular
case
concerns
the
events
of
july
23rd,
24th,
and
25th,
1986.
there
was
another
meeting
on
july
8th
prior
to
that
in
which
a
specific
parcel
of
land
was
identified
by
the
undercover
agent
as
one
they
were
interested
in
rezoning.
on
july
23rd,
there
were
three
different
calls
between
evans
and
the
undercover
agent.
the
middle
call
was
recorded.
the
undercover
agent
did
not
record
either
the
first
call
or
the
third
call.
there
were
two
factual
disputes
centering
from
those
two
calls.
one,
who
initiated
the
call.
evans
said
the
agent
did
and
he
was
returning
the
agent's
call.
in
fact,
he
introduced
into
evidence
his
phone
records
which
showed
that
the
agent
had
called
him
at
about
the
time
he
said,
at
his
undercover
apartment,
and
leaving
that
number.
in
the
third
call,
evans
said
that
the
agent
asked
him
to
bring
to
a
meeting
that
he
was
setting
up
for
the
following
day
a
list
of
his
campaign
needs,
because
the
campaign,
the
primary
campaign,
was
approximately
2
weeks
away.
the
agent
said
he
did
not
ask
evans
to
bring
any
such
list,
although
he
concedes
that
he
did
set
up
a
meeting
for
the
following
day.
in
any
case,
on
july
24th,
evans
promised
his
assistance
before
anything
was
offered
to
him,
as
he
had
every
time
he
had
met
them
since
march
of
1985.
he
had
previously
indicated
that
he
thought
a
meaningful
contribution
would
be
around
$1,000.
he
told
them
that
in
may
of
1986.
but
he
had
brought
with
him
a
budget
for
this
2
week
period
before
the
primary
campaign
which
showed
a
budget
of
$14,000,
and
he
had
an
$8,000
shortfall.
the
agent
indicated
that
he
was
willing
to
give
evans
$8,000.
evans
testified
at
that
point
he
was
so
stunned
by
the
amount
of
the
contribution
that
what
he
did
was
he
reported
only
$1,000
of
it.
he
took
$7,000
of
it
in
cash
and
did
not
report
it
until
much
later,
after
he
was
aware
of
the
investigation.
he
did
send
a
thank-you
note
to
the
agent
at
the
time
for
the
contribution
and
told
him
when
he
received
it
that
he
was
just
thankful
that
the
agent
would
even
talk
to
him
about
a
campaign
contribution.
evans
testified
that
he
used
that
campaign
contribution--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--i
don't
believe
there
was
any
reference
to
the
amount
of
the
contribution,
your
honor.
he
testified...
evans
testified
that
he
used
that
contribution,
$7,000
which
was
not
reported,
$4,100
went
back
to
his
mother
who
had
given
him
a
cash
contribution
of
$5,200
in
1982,
4
years
earlier...
which
was
duly
recorded.
and
the
other
$2,900
he
paid
back
to
himself
because
he
had
made
loans
to
his
own
campaign,
in
fact,
some
350
loans,
all
of
which
were
duly
documented
over
the
years.
evans'
contention
is
he
did
not
condition
his
assistance
on
any
payment
to
him
whatsoever.
the
undercover
agent
admitted
as
much
on
cross-examination,
that
evans
did
not
condition
his
assistance.
the
eleventh
circuit
agreed
in
their
opinion
that
in
fact
evans
did
not
condition
his
assistance,
but
they
said
he's
not
required
to.
the
eleventh
circuit
says
that
in
extortion
under
color
of
official
right,
no
inducement
is
required.
as
the
court
is
familiar,
nine
circuits
employ
what
is
known
as
the
majority
rule,
which
is
basically
that
if
a
public
official
accepts
a
payment
and
he
knows
that
that
payment
is
made
to
him
to
influence
his
official
action,
that
is
sufficient.
although
the
nine
circuits,
or
most
of
them
appear
to
pay
some
lip
service
to
the
word
inducement,
which
is
a
part
of
the
statute,
many
of
them
say
that
the
power
of
the
office
itself
provides
all
the
coercion
necessary.
and
in
fact,
that's
what
the
eleventh
circuit
says.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
there
certainly
are
cases,
justice
o'connor,
under
common
law,
in
which
that
is
true.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
there
are
quite
a
few.
in
fact,
at
common
law
it
was
a...
the
offense
was
a
misdemeanor.
many
of
those
cases
are
cases--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--i
think
it
makes
a
difference
because
when
you
back
to
1946
when
the
hobbs
act
was
passed,
it
seems
unlikely
to
me
that
congress
intended
to
take
a
common
law
misdemeanor
in
which
you
could
commit
the
offense
by
passive
acceptance
and
put
it
into
a
statute
aimed
at
professional
gangsters
where
the
problem
was
coercion,
violence,
and
extortion,
and
make
it
a
20-year
felony
without
giving
an
explanation.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
we
certainly
contend
that,
and
i
believe
the
government
does
also,
although
at
least
they
did
in
the
mccormick
case.
now,
the
new
york
law
is
interesting,
because
first
of
all
it
is,
of
course,
a
misdemeanor.
it
does
allow
passive
acceptance.
but
it's
receiving
a
fee
in
excess
of
that
allowed
by
statute.
what
it
appears
to
be,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
something
like
a
bill
collector
who
collects
fees
for
the
body
politic.
and
the
offense
is
committed
when
he
either
charges
you
more
than
you're
supposed
to
pay,
or
he
charges
you
when
you
don't
really
owe
anything,
or
he
charges
you
before
it's
actually
due.
those
are
how
the
statutes
are
normally
worded.
and
that's
very
similar,
in
fact,
to
the
common
law.
but
in
this
particular
case,
he
was
collecting
fee
in
excess
of
a
fee
allowed
by
statute.
it
seems
to
me
in
that
kind
of
a
case
there
is
actually,
probably,
coercion,
even
though
you
just
receive
it.
if
a
bill
collector
comes
to
my
door
and
he
wants
to
collect
a
fee
from
me,
i
know
that
when
he's
collecting
for
the
body
politic,
if
i
don't
pay,
there's
going
to
be
a
penalty
for
that.
i
mean,
he
is
a
coercive
individual
simply
by
the
fact
of
his
presence.
that
is
not
true,
i
think,
of
john
evans
or
anybody
who,
as
an
independent
agent
running
a
campaign,
whether
he's
just
running
for
office
for
the
first
time,
or
like
evans,
in
fact
he's
running
for
reelection.
secondly,
as
you
know,
extortion
schemes
then
and
now,
even
to
present
day,
make
a
distinction
between
a
victim,
whose
the
person
who's
the
payor,
and
the
extortionist,
who
is
the
payee.
we
do
not
prosecute
the
victim,
we
prosecute
only
the
person
who
extorts
it.
bribery,
on
the
other
hand,
we
prosecute
both
parties;
the
person
who
offers
the
bribe
and
the
person
who
receives
the
bribe.
there
is
no
better
case,
i
think,
that
blurs
the
distinction
than
the
evans
case.
because
clearly
in
the
evans
case,
the
fbi
agent
here,
even
leaving
aside
his
undercover
role,
was
clearly
the
aggressor
in
the
scenario.
by
the
time
that
he
made
the
contribution
he
had
courted
evans
for
some
16
months.
by
our
count,
he
had
offered
evans
money
some
30
times.
he
made
virtually
every
call
to
evans.
he
virtually
set
up
every
meeting
to
evans,
with
exception
of
one
call
which
was
disputed
on
july
23rd.
so
it's
very
hard
to
perceive
of
the
undercover
agent
in
our
case
as
a
victim.
certainly,
had
he
not
been
an
undercover
agent,
you
would
presume
that
he
would
have
been
prosecuted
because
it
was
a
bribe.
so
i
think
it's...
it
is
significant,
i
think,
that
both
new
york
and
in
common
law
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
whether
or
not
he
could
convict
it,
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
but
certainly
that
i
think
it
is...
it
is
a
classic
bribery
case.
i'm
offering
you
money,
here's
what
i
want
you
to
do.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
i
do.
it
simply
seems
very
unlikely
to
me
that
when
the
hobbs
act
was
passed
in
1946,
congress
intended
to
make
this
common
law
misdemeanor
into
a
20-year
felony
and
allow
passive
acceptance,
where
in
fact
the
statute
itself
was
aimed
at
violence,
at
coercion,
and
at
extortion.
it
seemed
to
me
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
this
into
what
appears
to
be
an
18th
and
19th
century
scheme
of
collecting
fees
at
a
time
when
the
people
who
collected
those
fees
were
basically
paid.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
have
to
ignore
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
extortion,
not
to
say
that
inducement
requires
more
than
that.
in
its
brief
in
mccormick,
the
government
said...
took
a
position
that
i
agree
with...
that
the
common
understanding
of
extortion
is
obtaining
money
by
consent
when
that
consent
is
induced
by
some
kind
of
future
threat.
and
if
in
fact
you
look
at
the
extortion
statutes
on
the
books
of
the
federal
government
today,
in
title
18,
virtually
every
one
of
them,
and
i
think
every
one
of
them,
either
talks
about
a
demand
or
a
threat.
those
are,
it
seems
to
me,
the
two
key
words
for
extortion--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--i
think
if
he
makes
a
demand
or--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--then
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
believe
that
he
means
when
he
says
it.
if
what
he
means
is
if
you
want
to
deal
with
me,
then
you
must
pay
me
money
in
advance,
if
he's
conditioning
his
performance,
yes,
i
think
it's
extortion.
if
you're
not
conditioning
his
performance,
i
think
it's
a
bribe.
i
think
that
is
the
distinction.
it's
a
distinction
that's
not
required
under
the
majority
rule,
but
i
think
it's
a
distinction
that's
present
in
all
the
extortion
statutes,
and
certainly
in
the
title
18,
1951(b)(2).
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think...
i
find
that
a
strange
reading.
i
note
with
interest
that
the
government
makes
that
argument
in
this
case,
although
they
took
the
opposite
argument
when
the
mccormick
brief
was...
when
the
mccormick
case
was
briefed
and
argued
back
in
january.
it's...
certainly
the
easiest
way
to
have
done
that,
if
that's
what
congress
intended,
would
have
been
to
put
the
under
color
of
official
right
language
at
the
beginning
and
the
other
language
at
the
end.
and
then
that
would
have
been
clear.
likewise
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
take
the
language
with
his
consent,
because
it's
with
his
consent
and
induced.
that
is
not,
i
think,
the
way
one
would
commonly
read
it.
and
if
congress
intended
to
do
that,
all
they
had
to
do
is
put
that
under
color
of
official
right,
right
at
the
beginning
and
put
the
other
at
the
ending,
it
would
have
been
very
clear.
likewise,
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
be
likely
that
congress
intended
to
do
that,
making
passive
acceptance
a
part
of
a
statute
which
is
aimed
at
violence,
coercion
and
extortion.
certainly
under
color--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--well,
i
think
that
it
was
necessary,
apparently--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--you
could
make
that
argument.
the
course
of
extortion
part
says
force,
violence,
or
fear.
and
what
we
say
is
it
has
to
be
a
demand
or
a
threat
under
color
of
official
right,
which
comports
with
the
common
understanding
of
extortion.
why
they
would
put
that,
under
color
of
official
right,
in
an
extortion
statute,
if
they
didn't
intend
to
comport
with
the
basic
understanding
of
extortion,
will
certainly
remain
a
mystery,
i
think.
but
i
understand
the
point
your
honor
is
making.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
think
it
is
a
mystery,
your
honor,
if
in
fact
they
intended
to
equate...
you'd
have
to
believe,
obviously
congress
intended
to
equate
passive
acceptance
with
violence,
coercion
or
extortion
under...
by
a
private
individual.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
certainly
is,
although
i
think
in
doing
so,
they
are
also
incorporating
a
new
meaning
of
extortion,
a
sense
of
extortion
that
we
have
not
known
before.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
meaning
the
common
law.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes.
i
mean,
i
know
that
is
the
court's...
admonition
of
the
court,
that
it
has
to
be
a
specific
undertaking.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
it's
a
campaign
contribution,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that's
passive
acceptance...
and
it's
essentially
a
bribe,
your
honor.
it's
essentially
what
we
classically
refer
to
as
a
bribe.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes.
i
mean
it
could
be.
i
don't
think
in
the
illustration
you
gave
me
that
it
was.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
would
be
a
bribe
by
the
donor.
i
think
it's
accepted
as
a
bribe
by
the
donee.
if
he
doesn't
demand
it,
if
he
doesn't
say
i
won't
perform
unless
you
give
it
to
me,
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
extortion.
it
certainly
may
be
illegal,
it
may
be
a
bribe.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
there's
certainly
acceptance
of
the
money
offered,
but
there's
certainly
no
condition
that
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
unless
that's
a
part
of
the
scenario,
that's
part
of
your
factual
scenario.
i
think
it's
a
classic
bribery
case.
i
offer
you
money
in
exchange
for
you
doing
whatever
you're
going
to
do.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
my
position,
of
course,
is
to
fit
it
into
an
extortion
definition.
it's
got
to
be
something
more
than
simply
acceptance,
whether
you
call
it
passive
acceptance
or
merely
accepting
money
that
is
offered.
i
think
it's
got
to
be
more
than
merely
accepting
money.
i
don't
know
if
it's
the
passive
part
that
bothers
you
or
what
it
is,
but
it's
certainly
not
a
demand
or
a
threat.
it's
certainly
what
we...
not
what
we
commonly
refer
to
as
extortion.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that
apparently
is
what
the
government
is
arguing
for,
although
i
would
note
that
under
the
new
york
law
it
wasn't
exactly
the
common
law
meaning,
it
was
the
fee
collection
by
statute
that
was
the
misdemeanor
under
new
york
law.
now
at
common
law,
it
was
a
little
broader
than
that.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
fee
collection
by
statute.
i
suppose
that
if
the
sheriff
wanted
to
let
somebody
out
of
jail
in
return
for
money,
that
might
have
been
a
common
law
misdemeanor.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
apparently
that
was
extortion
in
common
low.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
to
me,
i
think
you
have
to
interpret
the
statute
as
under
color
of
office,
even
though
i
understand
it
says
under
color
of
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
because
that
has
been
the
historically,
i
think,
how
that
term
has
been...
has
been
defined,
even
though
i
know
there
are
some
cases
in
which
there's
an
assumption
of
false
pretense.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
historically,
certainly
beginning
in
1934
and
in
1946
with
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
the
meaning
of
it
under
the
new
york
statute
was
a
fee
collection,
as
i've
indicated.
the
common
law,
as
i've
indicated,
i
think
was
a
little
broader
than
that
and
brings
to
mind
your...
our
example
about
the
sheriff.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
an
officer
or
a
public
official
who
collects
a
fee
authorized
by
statute.
that's
what
it
was
under
new
york.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes.
when
it's
not
or
when
it's
more
than--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--exactly.
to
me
that
is--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
sir,
that
is
under
color
of
right.
but
that,
i
think,
is
very
different
from
a
politician
who
is
seeking
a
campaign
contribution.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
he
is
a
public
official.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
if
he
doesn't
take
the
money
as
a
campaign
contribution,
obviously
he's
certainly
guilty
of
something.
he
has
no
reason
to
be
taking
money
other
than
as
a
campaign
contribution.
now
whether
he's
guilty
of
extortion--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--only
if
he
conditions
his
performance
on
under
color
of
official
right,
yes.
only
if
he--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--yes,
absolutely.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
under
color
of
official
right,
yes.
now
there
certainly
is
the--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--well--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--it
seems
to
me
he's
certainly
guilty
of
bribery.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
not
extortion
under
color
of
official
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
that's
certainly
true
in
terms
of
taking
the
new
york
misdemeanor
that
was
applied
to
the
hobbs
act.
that
was
a
fee
statute.
and
if
that's
where
the
hobbs
act
came
from,
then
you
could
certainly
make
that
argument.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
i
understand
the
argument
you're
making,
justice
souter,
and
i
certainly
agree
that
is
a
plausible
argument
to
make.
and
in
that
case,
certainly
we
wouldn't
be
under
color
of
official
right
because
it's
not
under
color
of
the
fee
statute,
which
was
adapted
from
new
york
law.
that
is
correct,
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
under
that
definition
it
was
would
not
be
extortion.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
no
court
has
ever
bought
that.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that's
why
i'm
not
arguing
it,
justice
souter.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
that's
true.
and
perhaps
that
is
what
justice
white--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--if
you
define
fear
as
being
a
demand
or
a
threat,
then
you're
right,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
they
seem
to
compare
the
coercive
section
with
the
under
color
of
official
rights
section,
obviously,
assuming
that
color
of
office
has
something
to
do
with
coercion.
but
certainly
i
think
that's
not
true
in
your
normal
campaign--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--you're
right.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
it
is
a
criminal
statute,
and
certainly
the
rule
of
lenity
applies,
your
honor.
you're
absolutely
right.
and
certainly
we
have
a
fee
statute,
and
i
have
no
problem
with
the
argument
that
you
are
making.
it's
just
that
no
court
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
made
that
argument.
but
it
certainly--
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
--well,
to
the
extent
you
make
the
fee
argument,
it
is
certainly
one
that
i
can
live
with,
justice
scalia.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
yes,
it
was.
mr.
c.
michael
abbott
well,
it
was
not
an
argument
that
we
had
made
in
the
appellate
court,
you
can
argue
that
under
rule...
you
know,
under
the
supreme
court
rules
we
have
no
right
to
present
it
now.
just
as
you
said
in
mccormick,
they
had
no
right
to
present
it.
but
that
was
the
real
problem
with
us.
our
brief
was
already
through
the
appellate
courts
and
we
had
not
made
that
argument
yet.
i
understand
what
justice
scalia
is
saying,
certainly
to
the
extent
that
the
new
york
law,
which
everybody
agrees
is
the
law,
was
a
fee
statute.
and
certainly
in
this
particular
case
the
petitioner
was
not
trying
to
collect
money
under
a
fee
statute.
so
to
that
extent,
it
would
not
apply.
let
me
just
very
briefly
come
to
count
two,
which
is
only,
of
course,
alive
if
in
fact
you
should
vote
for
me
on
count
one.
our
argument
on
count
two
is
very
simple
and
very
brief,
that
count
one
and
count
two
are
inextricably
linked,
that
on
count
two
the
jury
had
to
find
that
it
was
a
campaign
contribution
and
that
evans
used
it
to
pay
campaign
expenses
or
debt.
if
they
do
not
find
that,
then
obviously
he
didn't
report
it,
he
was
guilty.
it's
our
belief
if
the
jury
finds
extortion
on
count
one,
the
natural
inference
is
that
in
fact
an
extortion
of
payment
is
an
illegal
payment,
and
therefore
not
a
campaign
contribution.
and
in
fact,
i
note
in
the
mccormick
argument
that
there
were
several
questions
from
this
court
along
the
same
lines.
one
of
the
justices
asked
the
question,
if
we
assume
the
judge
told
the
jury
a
campaign
contribution
is
legal,
must
we
therefore
not
conclude
when
they
found
him
guilty
of
extortion,
that
it
wasn't
a
campaign
contribution?
i
think
that
is
the
natural
inference.
in
this
case
you
have
even
more,
because
the
judge
told
the
jury
that
if
it
comes
in
the
form
of
a
campaign
contribution,
it
still
may
be
extortion,
suggesting...
in
other
words,
he
didn't
say
if
it
is
a
campaign
contribution,
but
if
it's
accepted
in
exchange
for
requested
exercise
of
official
power,
it
is
still
extortion.
he
said
if
it
comes
in
the
form
of
the
campaign
contribution
as
such,
it
becomes
disguised
as
a
campaign
contribution,
if
it
comes
labeled
as
a
campaign
contribution,
or
if
it
comes
in
the
form
of
a
campaign
contribution,
it's
still
extortion.
i
think
the
jury
would
naturally
infer
a
campaign
contribution
was
illegal
if
in
fact
they
found
extortion.
finally
in
this
case
we
have
the
additional
element
not
present
in
mccormick,
that
it
was
a
campaign
contribution
made
by
an
undercover
agent.
and
the
question
arises,
can
an
undercover
agent
make
a
campaign
contribution?
an
issue
we
raised
in
the
district
court
as
to
who
has
the
burden
to
show
that.
and
to
the
extent
that
we
believe
that
the
focus
of
the
charge
was
on
the
undercover
agent,
rather
than
on
john
evans.
the
undercover
agent's
position,
as
the
government's
position,
certainly
was
that
it
was
not
a
campaign
contribution.
so
i
think
if
they
found
extortion
on
count
one,
they
were
likely
to
find
it
was
not
a
campaign
contribution,
therefore,
convict
on
count
two.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
i
see
that
i'm
out
of
time.
