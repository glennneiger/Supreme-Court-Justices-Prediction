now
at
common
law,
i
suppose,
that
would
have
been
the
case,
that
extortion
under
color
of
right
would
not
be
said
to
require
inducement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
difference
does
that
make?
i
know
you
make
that
point
in
your
brief,
and
say
well,
it's
more
serious
here,
i
don't
see
what
difference
that
would
make.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
everyone
agrees
that
it
was
patterned...
that
color
of
right
aspect
was
patterned
after
the
new
york
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
abbott,
you
certainly
could
read
the
hobbs
act
as
the...
the
under
color
of
official
right
language
modifying
the
verb
obtaining
rather
than
the
inducement
language.
in
other
words,
extortion
is
defined
in
the
hobbs
act.
we
don't
have
to
look
to
some
common
present-day
meaning.
it's
defined
there.
meaning
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
induced
by
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force
or
fear,
or
under
color
of
official
right.
so
it
could
be
that
it
means
obtaining
property
under
color
of
official
right,
no
inducement
there
at
all
required.
i
mean
that
certainly...
it
could
be
read
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
hardly
a
mystery
if
they
intended
to
incorporate
the
old
common
law
offense.
it's
not
a
mystery
at
all.
it's
plain
as
day.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
congress'
privilege,
to
lump
things
together
in
concocting
criminal
offenses.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
old
meaning
of
extortion,
not
a
new
one,
a
very
old
meaning
of
extortion.
