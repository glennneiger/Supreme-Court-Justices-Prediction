mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
under
color
of
official
right
portion
of
the
hobbs
act
codifies,
in
effect,
the
old
common
law
crime
of
official
extortion,
which
was
taken
directly
from
new
york
law,
which
in
turn
had
this
crime
of
official
extortion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
of
course,
at
common
law,
your
honor,
a
misdemeanor
didn't
mean
that...
what
it
now
means,
which
was
that
you
would,
in
federal
law
for
example,
be
subject
only
to
a
1-year
penalty,
but
it
rather
meant
that
it
was
not
a
crime
that
was
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
typically,
and
forfeiture
of
property.
so
a
misdemeanor
could
be...
could
result
in
imprisonment
for
life.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
a
misdemeanor,
but
again
misdemeanor
applied
to
a
very
large
number
of
cases.
and
the
number
of
crimes
that
were
subject
to
felony
description
was
really
rather
small.
it
was
still
larger
than
those
crimes
that
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty
today.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
under
new
york
law
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
and
that
did
not
subject
you
to
a
long
period
of
incarceration.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that
what
the
hobbs
act
did
was
to
take
a
whole
range
of
offenses
right
out
of
new
york
law,
including
some
very
serious
violent
offenses,
and
say
we're
putting
a,
as
it
was
originally
passed,
a
10-year
cap
on
this
and
you
can
sentence
from
anything
from
zero
up
to
10
years.
and
the
crimes,
of
course
would
range
in
seriousness
from
very
serious
violent
crimes,
perhaps
resulting
in
death,
to
armed
robberies,
to
very
violent
extortions,
down
to
something
that
you
might
regard
as
being
quite
minimal
such
as
taking
$10
to
which
you
weren't
entitled,
if
you
were
a
public
official.
and
the
sentencing
court
would
of
course
have
the
freedom
to
sentence
from
anything
from
probation
up
to
10,
and
as
it
was
later
changed
to
20
years.
but
we
think
it's
so
clear
that
congress
intended
simply
to
take
the
entire
new
york
law
of
extortion,
which
included
not
only
what
we
now
could
call
official
extortion,
but
also
coercive
extortion,
two
separate
crimes,
and
put
it
into
federal
law
defining
those
two
crimes
separately.
that
is
so
clear
that
you
have
to
look
to
new
york
law
and
the
common
law
that
undergirds
new
york
law
to
determine
what
the
scope
of
under
color
of
official
right
is.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
only
prosecution
that
we
could
find
under
the
official
extortion
branch
of
the
new
york
law
was
the
old
whaley
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
now
that
on
its
facts
did
involve,
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
mccormick,
did
involve
a
false
pretenses
type
of
offense.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
the
claim--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it's
an
old
case,
sir.
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
the...
what's
important,
i
think
about
the
whaley
case,
which
was
the
source
for
the
penal
code,
which
in
turn
is
the
basis
for
the
new
york
statutory
code,
the
important
thing
about
whaley
is
not
what
it
in
fact
involved.
yes,
it
involved
in
fact
a
false
pretenses
type
of
extortion.
and
there's
no
question
that
false
pretenses
type
of
violation
by
an
official
was
included
within
the
common
law
notion
of
official
extortion.
but
so
was
bribery
and
so
was,
for
that
matter,
coercive
activity
by
the
official.
and
the
point
of
the
whaley
case
is
found,
i
think,
not
so
much
in
its
facts,
as
in
what
that
court
says
the
crime
is.
and
what's
really
critical
here,
i
think,
is
to
look
at
the
description
of
the
crime,
which
is
described
in
exactly
the
terms
that
hawkins
uses,
and
cites
hawkins...
hawkins'
pleas
of
the
crown...
which
is
the
taking
by
color
of
office.
it
doesn't
say
taking
by
color
of
official
right.
what
the
penal
code
did--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--bribery
could
certainly
be
reached
through
this.
this
was
an
alternate
means
of
punishing
bribery.
it
was
called
official
extortion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
was
not
used...
well,
we
don't
know
if
it
was
never
used.
well,
all
we
know
is
that
the
cases
did
not
come
to
the
appellate
courts.
there
were
some
instances,
for
example
of...
there
was
at
least
one
instance
of
a
police
disciplinary
action
which
was
premised
on
that
statute
for
taking
money
on
the
side
in
which
there
was
no
indication
that
there
was
a
false
pretenses
aspect
of
it.
but
that
was
not
a
prosecution
as
such.
but
what's
important,
i
think,
about
the
way
the
case
is,
to
repeat,
is
that
it
adopts
in
haec
verba
the
common
law
formulation
of
official
extortion,
color
of
office,
and
what
i
think
the
penal
code
and
later
the
new
york
statutes
themselves
meant
by
official
right
is
not
right
to
the
fee,
but
authority
to
perform
official
services.
in
other
words,
color
of
official
right
is
not
my
claim
of
right
to
be
paid,
but
my
claim
of
right
to
take
these
kinds
of
activities.
and
the
example
i
would
give,
your
honor,
is
the
policeman,
who
as
in
a
case
which
is
very
parallel
to
the
new
york
statute
coming
from
pennsylvania
in
which
the
policeman
said,
give
me
$50,
and
i'll
let
you
open
this
house
of
prostitution.
now,
there's
no
question
that
there
was
no
assertion
of
entitlement
to
the
$50
by
virtue
of
there
being
a
$50
fee
associated
with
opening
houses
of
prostitution.
everyone
that
was
a
party
to
that
transaction
understood
that
the
$50
was
not
legitimate,
not
a
legitimate
fee.
but
nonetheless,
it
was
by
virtue
of
his
authority,
his
claim
of
right,
his
use
of
his
office,
or
misuse
of
his
office...
that
was
the
basis
for
his
obtaining
the
$50,
and
that
is
consistent
with
everything
in
the
common
law,
all
the
way
back
to
the
first
statute
of
westminster
in
1275,
when...
where
there
was
no
crime
of
bribery
at
all.
the
crime
that
was
created
was
the
crime
of
official
extortion,
and
it
covered
a
whole
range
of
official
misconduct,
including
classic
bribery
conduct,
including
conduct
involving
false
representation,
and
including
coercive
conduct.
and
some
examples,
and
i
think
the
best
source
for
these
examples
is
the
law
review
article
which
we
cite
several
times
by
lindgren.
but
he
goes
through
a
number
of
these
cases.
the
examples
from
the
common
law,
one
after
another
after
another,
are
cases
in
which,
for
example,
a
jailer
says
to
somebody
who's
being
held,
and
says,
i
will
let
you
out
if
you
give
me
some
money.
everybody...
there's
no
indications
that
there's...
it's
a
representation
by
the
jailer
that
he's
entitled
to
that
fee,
it's
an
obviously
corrupt
transaction.
that's
extortion
under
color
of
office.
now
our
contention
is
that's
exactly
the
crime
that
the
new
york
law
codified
in
1881
when
it
passed
what
amounts
to
the
penal
code.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
we
say
it
means
the
same
thing.
and
i
think
you
can
find
the
source
for
that
in
the
new
york
law
itself
because
if
you
take
the
new
york
statute
that
was
enacted
after
the
penal
code,
this
was
the
statute
of
1881,
and
the
provisions
of
this
statute
have
continued
right
on
through
the
period
in
which
the
hobbs
act
was
enacted,
and
right
up
until
there
was
a
large
revamping
of
new
york
criminal
law
in
1965.
but
throughout
the
period
congress
was
looking
at
both
the
antiracketeering
act
and
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
think
absolutely
and
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
can't
give
you
a
case
which
says
specifically
that
only
in
cases
in
which
the
official
was
not
the
initiator
of
the
transaction
he
is
nonetheless
guilty.
but
it's
quite
clear
that
no
common
law
case
turned
on
who
was
the
initiator
of
the
transaction.
and
in
fact,
the
treatises
that
discuss
the
common
law
all
talk
in
terms
of
obtaining
property,
not
in
terms
of
soliciting
it
or
going
out
and
seeking
property.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
actually
i
think
the
analogy...
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
way
the
common
law
courts
looked
at
this
problem
was
to
say
that
someone's
office
itself
has
a
very
powerful
potential
coercive
effect,
and
the
officer
doesn't
have
to
underscore
the
matter
by
going
out
and
soliciting.
but
i
think
the
analogy
further
breaks
down
because
there
are
coercive
extortion
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
not
the
person
who
puts
someone
at
fear,
the
defendant,
let's
say
a
mob
boss,
is
not
the
person
who
either
initiates
the
fear
or
takes
any
sort
of
steps
to
put
the
person
in
fear.
he
merely
exploits
the
fear.
he
knows
that
that
person
fears
that
if
he
does
not
pay
money
to
be
allowed
to
run
his
business
in
the
neighborhood,
for
example,
that
he
will...
something
will
happen
to
him.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
is
typically
true,
of
course,
in
official
extortion,
too.
there's
a
reason
that
people
come
to
officials
thinking
that
they
may
benefit
from
dealing
with
this
official.
but
setting
that
aside,
it
isn't
necessary
to
show
that
he
has
threatened
somebody
in
the
past,
merely
that
he
knows
that
he
is
feared
and
that
he
takes
money
exploiting
that
fear.
but
in
any
event,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
common
law
did
not
distinguish
between
payments
that
were
excepted
without
solicitation,
as
in
classic
bribery
cases,
and
payments
in
which
one
went
out
and
solicited
a
bribe.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
doesn't
matter.
you
mean
in
the
course
of
extortion
cases
such
as
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
no.
that's
not
necessary.
all
that's
necessary
is
that
the
payee
believe
that
the
payor
is
paying
either
in
order
to
induce
the
payor
to
take
action
for...
in
his
favor,
out
of
fear
that
adverse
action
will
be
taken.
in
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
no,
it
was
not.
and
that
isn't
necessary,
we
contend,
under
official
extortion.
in
other
words,
extortion--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
it
is
because
in
the
common
law,
and
again
in
the
new
york
law,
there
didn't
have
to
be
a
sense
of
compulsion
and
a
sense
of
fear
in
order
to
establish
official
extortion,
even
if
you
were
seeking
only
benefit.
in
other
words,
even
if
you
had
nothing,
no
concern
at
all
that
you
would
be
dealt
with
unfairly
unless
you
made
the
payment,
but
were
seeking
only
to
get
an
unfair
advantage
over
all
your
competitors,
let's
say
in
bidding,
you
would
be
guilty
of...
or
the
official
who
takes
the
money
would
be
guilty
of
official
extortion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
two
points.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
latter
point,
there
is...
that
the
cases
to
which
you
are
pointing
in
new
york
law
regarding
this
distinction
between
bribery
and
extortion
related
to
coercive
extortion.
that
is
to
say,
those
cases
involved
the
leg-breaker
type
extortion.
and
there,
sensibly
enough,
the
court
said,
you
can't
be
convicted
of
bribery
if
somebody
has
threatened
to
break
your
leg
unless
you
pay.
those
cases--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--let
me
go
to
my
second
point,
which
is
to
read
the
provision
of
the
1881
new
york
code,
which
again
has
come
all
the
way
through
the
period
of
the
hobbs
act
to
1965,
that
relates
to
official
extortion,
that
goes
beyond
just
the
definitional
section
that
found
its
way
into
the
hobbs
act.
there
were
three
different
pertinent
sections
of
new
york
law
here.
first
there
was
the
definitional
section,
which
is
almost
identical
to
the
section
that
appears
as
the
definition
of
extortion
in
the
hobbs
act.
then
there
was
another
section
which
described
extortion
by
fear,
that
is
to
say
coercive
extortion.
then
there
was
a
section
that
separately
set
out
the
offense
of
official
extortion.
let
me
read
it
to
you
and
see
if
this
doesn't
resolve
what
exactly
it
was
that
this
offense
was
directed
at,
because
i
think
it's
quite
clear.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
this
is...
this
statute
is
not
set
out,
but
it
is
described
at
page...
let's
see,
at
page
25
of
our
brief,
in
the
middle.
and
i
think...
yes,
that's
where
it
appears.
but
let
me
read
it,
that
section
for
you.
it
says--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--25.
i'm
sorry.
25
of
our
brief.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it's
a...
yeah,
section
855,
which
was
originally
section
557
of
the
1881
code.
in
1909
it
was
changed
to
855.
extortion
by
public
officers:
a
public
officer
who
asks
or
receives
or
agrees
to
receive
a
fee
or
other
compensation
for
his
official
service
commits
extortion.
that
includes
someone
not
only
who
asks,
but
also
who
receives.
those
are
alternate
grounds
for
liability.
compensation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--certainly.
a
public
officer
who
asks
or
receives
or
agrees
to
receive
a
fee
or
other
compensation
for
his
official
service.
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
there
is
a
claim
of
right
to
that
money.
this
is
simply
an
i'm
taking
it
for
official
services,
and
official
services
as
understood
throughout
the
common
law
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
that
would
not
be,
your
honor,
because
that
would
not
be
a
payment...
the
common
law
is
very
clear,
the
payment
had
to
be
related
to
a
specific
service.
if,
however,
the
constituent
sent
the
money
and
had
said
i
want
to
pay
you
for
having...
or
for
voting
on
bill
x,
or
even
for
having
voted
on
bill
x--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
closer
you
get
to
saying
thank...
you
know,
please
vote
for
the
farm
bill,
here's
$10,000.
setting
aside
the
campaign
contribution
complexity,
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
no,
your
honor,
i
think
this...
when
they
refer
to
fee
or
other
compensation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i'm
sorry,
but
the
rest
of
the
statute
goes
on
for
a
while
and
says
in
excess
of
the
amount
permitted
or
where
it's
not
permitted.
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is...
well,
i
think
it's
not
pertinent
to
our
inquiry
here
because
there's
no
question
that
we're
not
talking
about--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
because
this...
our
statute
picks
up
on
the
new
york
definition.
and
in
order
to
determine
what
new
york
law
is,
we
would
have
to
go
down
to
this
section--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
that's
right.
now,
the
way
we
suggest
that
this
has
to
be
read
is
that
it
has
to
be
read
as
incorporating
new
york
law.
but
we
have
to
determine
what
does
obtaining
property
under
color
of
official
right...
and
what
it
means
is
with
respect
to
official
extortion,
you
have
to
look
to
section
557
of
the
new
york
law,
which
talked
in
terms
as
the
common
law
had
of
taking
compensation
which
is
beyond
that
which
is
permitted
to
you.
there's
no
question
that
you
can
take
the...
you
can
cash
your
check
each
week
without
violating
the
hobbs
act.
and
that
new
york
law
makes
clear,
as
does
federal
law,
there's
no
question--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
statute
uses
a
term
of
art,
and
our
position
is
that
term
of
art
is
not...
it
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
its
origins,
which
were
in
new
york
law
and
the
common
law.
and
its
origins
make
quite
clear
that
we
are
talking
about
compensation
in
excess
of
that
which
you
are
permitted.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think,
yes,
i
think
that
the
words
under
color
of
official
right
on
their
face
do
not
answer
the
question
of
how
broad
the
statute
is.
that's
true
of
many
common
law
terms
that
show
up
in
criminal
statutes.
you
can
have...
the
word
mayhem
in
and
of
itself
does
not
strike
one
as
having
a
particular
meaning,
but
you
look
to
the
common
law
for
the
meaning
of
a
term
like
that
when
it
shows
up
in
a
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
the
new
york
statute
uses
the
term
in
its
definitional
section
of
extortion
under
color
of
official
right.
that
is
clear
that
that
points
to
official--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
language
from
the
definitional
section
was
taken
word
for
word
and
put
right
into
the
1934
act,
which
was
the
predecessor
of
the
hobbs
act,
and
the
hobbs
act
changed
about
two
words
that
aren't
pertinent
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
may
not.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
for
past
services.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that
would
involve
the
gratuity
as
opposed
to
the
taking
of
a
bribe.
but
we
think
that
the
hobbs
act
does
extend
to
certain
kinds
of
gratuities
when
the
performance
and
the
payment
are
linked
as
closely
as
they
would
be
in
your
hypothetical.
and
let
me
give
you
a
case
that
exemplifies
why
that
is
so.
the
cuda
case
from
the
seventh
circuit
involved
a
case
in
which
a,
i
suppose
it
was
a
builder
in
chicago
sought
a
zoning...
permission
to
have
a
zoning
variance
from
an
alderman.
the
alderman
gave
his
permission,
and
then
the
builder
went
back
later
and
said
how
much
do
i
owe
you.
and
the
alderman
said
$1,500.
now
there
was
no
prior
understanding
or
arrangement
or
whatnot,
but
that
was
deemed
to
be
extortion
under
color
of
official
right
because
it
was
a
compensation
for
a
specific
official
act.
that,
we
think,
would
apply.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
is
our
position--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
that
isn't
this
case,
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
at
least
with
respect
to
a
specific
payment
for
a
specific
act,
it
would
include
certain
kinds
of
gratuities.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
travel
act,
which
is
the
statute
that
governs
interstate
travel
or
transportation,
the
use
of
interstate
facilities
to
effect
a
violation
of
state
bribery
or
extortion
laws.
then
you
would
have
to
prove,
of
course,
there
was
some--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
except
with
respect
to
official...
federal
officials,
of
course.
federal
officials
would
be
covered,
but
with
respect
to
state
officials
and
local
officials--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
would
not
be
covered.
i'm
sorry,
section
201
covers
federal
officials.
the
travel
act
would
cover,
depending
on
what
the
particular
state
law
was,
would
cover
bribery
and
extortion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
although
there's
a
question,
the
question
would
be
open
as
to
whether
you
can
prosecute
the
donor
under
certain
circumstances
for
aiding
and
abetting.
but
that
is
a
separate
question
on
which
there
has
been
some
case
law.
but
it
has
not
been
resolved.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
since...
well,
there
haven't
been,
to
my
knowledge,
very
many
prosecutions
under
that
statute.
i
am
not
aware
of
donors
ever
being
prosecuted
for
extortion
under
either
the
new
york
statute
or
even
any
of
the
other
state
statutes
where
prosecutions
were
more
common,
as
in
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania,
where
the
prosecutions
were
more
common.
you
found
in
those
cases,
as
i
mentioned
before,
standard
bribery-type
conduct,
but
you
always
found
only
the
recipient,
the
official
being
prosecuted.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
traditional
common
law
approach,
which
is
to
say
this
is
a
crime
committed
by
the
official.
it's
really
a
violation
against
public
justice
rather
than
any
form
of
property
crime
or
any
form
of
crime
as
to
which
the
payor
would
be
separately
liable.
i
think,
if
i
may
very
briefly
address
the
question
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
not
the
official
right,
but
the
inducement
feature,
if
you
look
at
the
1934
act,
it
becomes
even
clearer,
i
think,
than
it
is
in
the
1946
act,
that
induced,
the
induced
clause,
applies
to
the
coercive
instruction
portion
of
the
statute,
and
not
to
the
under
color
of
official
right.
the
1934
statute
says,
whoever
obtains
with
his
consent
property,
comma,
induced
by
fear
or
force,
comma,
or
under
color
of
official
right.
in
other
words,
it
makes
the...
there's
less
language
in
the
coercive
induced
section,
and
therefore
it's
clearer
that
the
induced
relates
to
force
or
fear
and
not
to
color
of
official
right.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
concept
of
obtaining
property
under
color
of
official
right.
you
never
find
in
the
treatises
of
the
time,
in
the
cases,
you
never
find
the
language
induced
under
color
of
official
right.
you
find
obtains
or
takes
by
color
of
office,
or
under
color
of
office,
or
again--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct.
they
have
assumed
that.
and
i
think
the
assumption
was
incorrect
because
i
think
they
found
it
unnecessary
to...
nothing
turned
on
it
because
they
say
well,
the
office
does
the
inducing,
therefore,
it...
no
additional
inducement
is
required.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
