justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
must
say
that's
a
very
odd
use
of
the
term
passive
acceptance.
in
the
law
of
contracts,
we
wouldn't
say
there's
an
implied
contract
or
a
passive
contract,
we
would
say
there's
an
explicit
contract
in
the
hypothetical
justice
stevens
put
to
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
we're
all
agreed
it's
a
classic
bribery
case,
the
question
is
what
does
passive
acceptance
mean.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
strange
use
of
the
term.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
there
an
instruction
required
that
the
payor
must
know
that
if
he
doesn't
pay
that
there
will
be
adverse
action
taken
against
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
this
case
was
the
jury
instructed
that
there
had
to
be
some
anticipation
or
fear
on
the
grounds
of
the
payor
that
adverse
action
would
be
taken?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
because
we
presume
that
that
fear
is
present
whenever
you're
dealing
with
an
official?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
donors
or
payers
ever
prosecuted
under
the
new
york
statute?
