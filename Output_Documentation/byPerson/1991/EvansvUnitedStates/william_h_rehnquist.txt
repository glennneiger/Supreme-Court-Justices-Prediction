we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-6105,
john
h.
evans,
jr.
v.
united
states.
mr.
abbott.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
thank
him
for
$1,000
or
for
$8,000?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
on
these
facts
evidence,
could
have
been
convicted
of
bribery
but
not
of
extortion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
you
agree
the
legal
elements
are
there,
whether
or
not
a
jury
would
find
him
guilty
or
not
guilty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
say
a
registrar
of
deeds,
the
fee
for
filing
a
quick
claim
deed
is
$10.
the
registrar
of
deeds
comes
to
the
window
and
says
that'll
be
$20
when
i
bring
it.
is
that
under
color
of
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abbott.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
if
you're
right
on
that,
why
is
a
maximum
20-year
penalty
attached
to
this
particular
offense,
whereas
at
both
the
common
law
and
in
new
york
law,
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
a
misdemeanor
with
a
very
minor
penalty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
be
imprisoned
for
life
under
a
common
law
rule--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--for
the
extortion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
registrar
of
deeds
who
asked
for
$20
and
got...
when
he
was
only
entitled
to
$10?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
under
new
york
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
in
effect
that
under
color
of
office
means
pretty
much
the
same
thing
as
under
color
of
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
section
855.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
read
that
once
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
the
language
you
read,
it
sounds
as
if
the
registrar
of
deeds
who
asks
for
$10
to
record
a
deed
and
the
fee
is
$10
is
guilty
of
extortion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
registrar
asks
for
fees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
abbott,
your
time
had
expired,
so
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
