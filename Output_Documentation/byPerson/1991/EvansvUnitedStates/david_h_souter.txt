why
don't
you
take
the...
i'm
sorry.
why
don't
you
just
make
the
argument
that
justice
scalia
suggested
that
color
of
right
refers
to...
refers
back
to
right
to
fees?
and
in
a
case
in
which
a
public
official
is
not
entitled
to
fees,
that
condition
can
never
be
satisfied
in
a
hobbs
act
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
best
reading
of
how
we
get
the
word
right
in
there
as
opposed
to
color
of
law
or
abuse
of
authority
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
why
you're
not
arguing
it
today.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
do
your...
i'm
sorry.
do
your
examples
take
you
the
further
step
to
make
it
clear
that
in
common
law
it
would
have
been
official
extortion
if
the
official
had
not
made
the
first
statement,
give
me
the
$50
and
i'll
let
you
out,
but
instead
had
been
the
recipient
of
the
statement
saying,
here's
$50,
it's
yours
if
you
let
me
out.
would
that
have
been
comprehended
in
common
law
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
examples
like
the
examples
you
just
gave
to
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
this
argument
to
be
made,
isn't
there,
that
at
least
in
the
nonofficial
extortion
by
force,
threat,
and
so
on,
the
person
who's
going
to
end
up
with
the
money
is
making
some
kind
of
affirmative
act
to,
in
other
words,
making
the
threat
or
applying
the
force,
twisting
the
arm,
or
whatnot.
and
that
at
least
would
be
our
analogy
with
the
official
who
initiates
the
transaction
by
saying,
i
will
do
thus
and
so
if
you
give
me
the
money.
whereas
that
analogy
doesn't
hold
if
he
just
simply
sits
there
and
in
response
to
the
offer
takes
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
because
he's
broken
somebody
else's
arm.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
some
point,
he's
initiated
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
the
step
in
the
argument
that
i
guess
i'm
unclear
on
is
taking
the
definition
as
you
just
read
it
from
the
new
york
statute,
how
does
that
become
subsumed
under
the
term
of
art
that
is
being
used
in
the
hobbs
act?
i
mean,
the
new
york
statute
didn't
use
the
same
term
that
the
hobbs
act
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
it
did
use
that
term?
