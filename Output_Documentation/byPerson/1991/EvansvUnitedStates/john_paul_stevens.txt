justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask...
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you...
this
one
question.
you
keep
using
the
term
passive
acceptance...
i
think
that's
what
your
term
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
passive
acceptance,
in
your
view:
a
constituent
comes
to
a
legislator
and
says,
i
will
give
you
a
$10,000
campaign
contribution
if
you
vote
yes
on
bill
so-and-so.
and
he
says,
i
agree.
is
that
passive
acceptance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
idea
of
passive
acceptance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
possible
that
the
same
transaction
could
be
a
bribe
by
the
giver
of
the
money
and
extortion
by
the
recipient
of
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
be
a
bribe
by
the
donor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
under
that
argument
the
official
can
say
i
will
vote
against
you
unless
you
give
me
x
dollars.
i
mean,
a
legislator
can
just
go
around
and
say
i'm
going
to
introduce
a
bill
condemning
your
house
if
you
don't
give
me
$100,000.
and
that
would
not
be
extortion
under
that
reading.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
no
court
has
ever
bought
that
reading
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
no
court
has
ever
done
that
either,
has
it?
they've
always
used
that
phrase
to
talk
about
the
thug
who
goes
out
and
threatens
physical
violence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
two
questions.
one,
i
think
you
may
have
misspoken,
and
i
want
to
be
sure,
or
i
misunderstood
you.
i
think
you
said
that
if
a
constituent
sends
in
a
check
for
$10,000
and
says
i'm
giving
you
this
money
because
last
year
you
voted
for
bill
x,
may
he
keep
that
check?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
for
past
services?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
no
prior
communication
between
them
at
all
and
no
quid
pro
quo
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
evidence
there
would
suggest
that
the
parties
understood
that
compensation
would
be
paid
sooner
or
later.
i'm
not
sure
that's
similar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
i'm
not
sure
that's
exactly
like
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
any
event,
that's
not
raised
by
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
just
as
a
matter
of
information?
if
we
disagreed
with
your
reading
of
the
extortion
statute,
is
there
a
provision
of
the
criminal
code
that
covers
the
knowing
acceptance
of
money
that
the
donor
expects
to
be
used
to
pay
for
a
legislative
vote
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
independent,
just
plain
garden
variety,
like
a
bribe,
that
no
separate
crime
other
than
extortion...
federal
crime...
for
the
receipt
of
a
bribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
have
assumed
that
the
induced...
that
it
was
inducement
to
accept
the
money
in
exchange
for
the
commitment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
of
the
two
cases
is
evans
against
united
states,
no.
90-6105.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
as
part
of
an
investigation
of
public
corruption
in
georgia,
and
fbi
agent
posing
as
a
real
estate
developer
had
a
number
of
conversations
with
petitioner,
evans,
an
elected
member
of
the
dekalb
county
board
of
commissioners.
the
agent
sought
evans'
assistance
in
an
effort
to
rezone
a
track
of
land
and
gave
him
$7,000
in
cash
which
evans
failed
to
report
on
his
state
campaign
financing
disclosure
form
or
on
his
federal
income
tax
return.
evans
was
convicted
in
district
court
of
extortion
under
the
hobbs
act,
a
federal
statute
which
prohibits
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
induced
by
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence,
or
fear,
or
under
color
of
official
right.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
explaining
that
under
the
hobbs
act
a
violation
occurs
if
the
public
official
knew
that
he
was
being
offered
the
payment
in
exchange
for
a
specific
requested
exercise
of
his
official
power.
he
need
not
have
demanded
or
requested
the
money.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
over
the
question
whether
an
affirmative
act
of
inducement
by
a
public
official
such
as
a
demand
is
an
element
of
the
offense
of
extortion
under
color
of
official
right
prohibited
by
the
hobbs
act.
we
agree
with
the
eleventh
circuit
that
it
is
not
and,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
that
court.
we
base
our
construction
of
the
statute
largely
on
the
fact
that
congress
has
presumed
to
have
adapted
the
common
law
definition
of
extortion
which
did
not
require
a
public
official
to
make
a
demand
or
a
request.
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
have
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
