ms.
janet
c.
hall
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
on
review
in
this
case
is
the
applicability
of
section
1292(b)
of
title
28
to
an
appeal
to
the
courts
of
appeals
from
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court's
order
is
an
interlocutory
order,
and
it
was
entered
while
sitting
in
review
of
a
bankruptcy
court
order
entered
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
section
1292(b)
apply
in
this
instance.
we
have
an
order
of
the
district
court
in
a
civil
action
which
has
been
certified.
therefore,
there
should
be
found
under
1292(b)
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
the
petition.
in
addition,
section
1292(b)
had
been
applied
to
bankruptcy
cases
prior
to
1978.
it
had
been
applied
both
subsection
(b)
since
1958,
and
prior
to
that,
what
is
now
subsection
(a)
concerning
injunctive
orders
had
been
applied
in
the
bankruptcy
context
previously.
to
reach
the
conclusion--
ms.
janet
c.
hall
--i
believe
they're
important,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
they
demonstrate
that
there
was
an
existing
scheme,
which
recognized
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
section
1292
as
well
as
other
sections
which
granted
jurisdiction
of
bankruptcy
cases.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
that
is
correct,
although,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
still
described
in
the
'84
legislation
as
a
unit
of
the
district
court.
and
because
of
marathon,
it
must
rest
on
the
article
3
power
of
the
district
court.
although
the
system
has
changed,
it
is
not
that
great
a
difference
in
that
the
house's
view
of
creating
article
3
independent
courts
never
prevailed
in
congress.
these
cases,
pre-1978,
teach
us
that
there
was
recognized
jurisdiction
and
existing
jurisdictional
scheme
under
1292,
as
well
as
other
sections,
and
that
therefore,
to
reach
the
result
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
reached
would
require
you
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
take
away
that
jurisdictional
grant,
that
discretionary,
interlocutory
appellate
power,
and
that
it
intended
to
treat
bankruptcy
cases
in
a
manner
different
than
it
treats
all
other
civil
actions.
now
this
is
a
dramatic
result
to
be
reached,
particularly
in
the
face
of
no
evidence
to
support
such
a
result
or
such
a
conclusion.
and
it
makes
no
sense
to
conclude
that
congress
would
intend
to
do
that
when
there
was
before
congress
no
particular
problem
faced
by
1292
interlocutory
appeals
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
there
was
not
abuse
alleged
or
pointed
to,
no
problem
identified
that
would
be
a
basis
or
a
reason
for
making
this
change.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
in
part
it
was
needed
because
of
initially
the
house's
desire
to
create
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panels.
in
section
1293,
which
is
the
origin
of
158(d),
the
house
wrote
section
1293
in
order
to
create
two
additional
bases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
had
not
previously
existed.
that
is,
final
decisional
review
of
appeals
from
bankruptcy
panels,
which
of
course
were
new
creations,
and
also
to
permit
the
consensual
direct
appeal
on
final
orders
only
directly
from
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
had
been
a
desire
of
the
house.
when
section
158(d)
was
written
in
1984,
it
took
both
1293
as
well
as
other
sections...
1482,
concerning
bankruptcy
panels,
and
1334,
which
concerned
the
district
court...
appeals
up
from
the
bankruptcy
court
to
the
district
courts...
and
put
them
together
in
158.
to
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question
directly,
there
is
a
redundancy.
other
than
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
bankruptcy
panels,
which
appears
in
(d),
(d)
is
repetitive
in
part
of
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
appeals
under
1291.
however,
a
mere
redundancy
where
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
provisions,
in
other
words,
you
can
apply
both
158(d)
to
a
core
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
you
can
apply
1291,
and
achieve
this
exact
same
result.
there
will
be
jurisdiction
on
final
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
is
further
no
reason
to
conclude
that
congress
would
wish
to
treat
bankruptcy
appeal
different
because
the
purpose
served
by
1292(b),
in
particular
when
it
was
enacted,
the
purpose
it
sought
to
address
is
just
as
pertinent
in
bankruptcy
cases
as
it
is
in
all
other
civil
cases.
the
limited
discretionary
appeal
that
was
granted
to
the
courts
of
appeals
under
1292(b)
was
designed
to
provide
a
specific
benefit.
that
is,
when
the
district
court
certifies
that
the
issue
at
hand
was
a
controlling
issue
of
law,
as
to
which
there
was
substantial
disagreement
as
to
the
correct
answer,
and
a
result
or
a
decision
immediately
might
advance
the
termination
of
the
litigation,
the
courts
of
appeals
were
to
entertain
such
requests
to
hear
these
appeals.
and
only
if
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
in
its
discretion
to
hear
it
would
an
appeal
be
entertained.
two
benefits
are
achieved
here.
potentially,
there
is
an
advancement
of
the
instant
litigation
that
is
the
subject
of
the
1292(b)
case,
but
in
addition
what
you
achieve
is
the
addressing
at
the
circuit
level,
not
at
a
district
court
level,
but
at
the
circuit
level,
of
an
important,
presumably
unsettled
issue
of
law.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
it
is
plausible,
your
honor,
and
it
is
something
congress
could
have
done.
it
is
my
position
that
it
did
not
do
so
here.
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
that
is
the
path
congress
chose,
you
must
conclude,
as
the
second
circuit's
reasoning
went,
that
because
of
this
mere
redundancy,
which
is
an
affirmance
of
the
grant
of
jurisdiction,
that
we
must
conclude
that
158(d)
is
exclusive,
in
essence,
is
the
stop
in
interlocutory
appeals.
and
that,
therefore,
if
it
is
exclusive
of
1291,
it
necessarily
is
exclusive
of
1292.
well,
of
course,
158(d)
does
not
say
that,
unlike,
for
example,
the
expediting
act.
it
does
not
say
these
are
the
only
appeals,
it
merely
makes
an
affirmative
statement
of
appellate
jurisdictional
grant.
therefore,
you
must
find
an
implied
appeal.
and
implied
repeals
are
drastic
and
rare
results,
as
taught
by
the
precedents
in
this
court.
and
i
would
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
requirements
of
meeting
such
a
test
of
implied
repeal
are
woefully
lacking.
first,
there
is
no
irreconcilability,
as
i
pointed
out
before.
158(d),
the
part
it
shares
in
common
with
1291,
provides
for
exactly
the
same
result.
so
they
are
not
irreconcilable.
second,
the
second
alternative,
which
requires
that
the
later
enacted
statute
be
comprehensive
and
be
a
substitute
for
the
earlier
alleged
to
be
repealed
statutes,
also
does
not
pertain
here.
clearly,
158(d)
is
not
a
comprehensive
substitute
for
1291
and
1292.
otherwise
we
are
left
with
no
general
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
appeals
from
decisions
of
the
district
court.
even
if,
however,
we
were
to
get
by
one
of
these
two
requirements
for
implied
repeals,
we
are
still
met
with
the
problem
of
where
is
the
evidence
of
congress'
clear
and
manifest
intent
to
repeal
this
jurisdictional
grant
in
1292(b).
it
is
not
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
in
the
purpose
of
the
act.
nor
can
it
be
found
in
the
legislative
history.
this
is
a
case
where
we
have
in
the
legislative
history
two
reports,
both
written
before
this
section
was
crafted.
neither
of
those
reports
support
a
conclusion
of
a
clear
and
manifest
intent
to
stop
the
process
of
interlocutory
appeals
short
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
strip
them
of
this
discretionary
power
to
hear
an
interlocutory
appeal.
now
the
second
circuit
found
an
intent
by
congress
in
this
same
legislative
history.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
the
second
circuit
took
a
course
which
this
court
has
counselled
against
strongly
and
has
disfavored,
and
that
is
that
the
second
circuit
relied
upon
new,
unexplained
intermediate
steps
going
back
and
forth
between
the
house
and
the
congress,
and
also
upon
silence,
the
absence
of
words
in
158(d).
neither
of
those
have
been
found
in
the
past
to
support
a
finding
or
a
demonstration
of
clear
and
manifest
intent.
the
trustee
here
is
faced
with
a
difficult
problem.
if
he
urges
on
this
court
that
you
must
support
his
position
and
find
that
the
redundancy
in
158(d)
requires
the
result
that
1292
will
no
longer
will
apply
in
bankruptcy
cases,
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
position
is
the
redundancy,
then
he
must
answer
the
question
of
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
language
found
in
section
305
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
enacted
by
congress
in
1990.
section
305
concerns
orders
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
dismiss
or
suspend
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
your
honor,
it
is
addressed,
i
believe,
as
the
last
point,
at
pages
34
and
35.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
roman
numeral
vi.
when
that
was
initially
enacted,
again
in
1984
with
the
new
bankruptcy
code,
the
provision
read
that
decisions
of
the...
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
excuse
me,
to
suspend
or
to
dismiss
a
proceeding,
shall
not
be
taken
by
way
of
appeal
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
were
some
litigations
surrounding
this...
that
section,
in
particular
the
question
of
whether
a
denial
of
such
a
motion
would
be
appealable,
even
though
the
statute
said
the
granting
would
not.
in
1990--
ms.
janet
c.
hall
--it
does,
your
honor.
it
does,
your
honor,
it
sets
it
forth
as
it
now
appears
after
the
1990
amendment,
with
the
additional
language
in
italics.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
bottom
of
page
34
and
then
up
to
35.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
the
amendment
in
1990
that
congress
passed
was
to
amend
305,
first
to
make
it
clear
that
a
denial
of
such
a
motion
would
also
not
be
appealable.
but
in
addition,
to
specifically
iterate
the
sources
of
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction,
which
could
not
be
availed
in
order
to
take
an
appeal
under
305.
when
they
listed
those
sections,
and
this
is
of
course
an
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
clearly,
by
its
own
terms
305
says
bankruptcy
court.
and
second,
it
could
clearly
be
an
interlocutory
order.
for
example,
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
suspend,
thus
the
case
continues
with
the
interlocutory.
when
congress
was
specifically
addressing
the
question
of
the
source
of
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
of
appeals
in
bankruptcy
cases,
it
said
such
appeals
in
this
instance...
not
this
case,
i'm
sorry...
section
305...
would
not
be
permitted
under
158(d)
or
1291
or
1292.
thus,
when
congress
means
to
restrict
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
appeals
in
a
bankruptcy
situation,
it
says
it
expressly.
the
language
of
that
amendment
is
directly
contrary
to
the
position
the
trustee
urges
on
this
court.
what
is
the
court
to
do
with
the
congress'
statement,
clear
recognition,
that
an
appeal
under
1292
is
to
be
permitted
in
bankruptcy
matters
coming
up
from
the
bankruptcy
court,
except
in
certain
specific
instances,
305
being
one
and
1334(c)
being
another,
and
the
remand
statute
being
the
third
that
was
amended
in
1990.
as
i've
indicated,
in
conclusion,
the
plain
words
of
1292(b)
would
provide
discretionary
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
appeals
in
this
case
below.
158(d)
does
not
require
a
different
result.
it
is
not
a
clear
statement
by
the
congress
that
it
meant
to
change
an
existing
jurisdictional
grant
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
words
of
the
statute
do
not
support
such
a
result,
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
code
does
not
support
such
a
result,
and
the
legislative
history
is
silent.
thus,
this
court
ought
to
interpret
the
plain
words
of
the
statute,
1292,
to
find
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
to
conclude
that
158(d)
does
not
plainly
express
a
congressional
intent
to
alter
the
pre-existing
jurisdictional
grant
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
would,
therefore,
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
second
circuit
of
appeals,
to
remand
the
case
to
the
second
circuit
for
consideration
of
connecticut
national
bank's
petition
for
a
leave
to
appeal.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
request
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
response
to
some
questions
about
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panels.
in
addition
to
them
being
consensual
courses
of
appeal
for
the
litigants,
there's
another
important
aspect
of
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panels,
which
the
district
court
decision
does
not
give
us.
and
that
is
they
are
constituted
or
meant
to
be
constituted
on
a
circuit-wide
basis.
they
are
created
by
the
circuit,
and
presumably
their
decisions
have
precedential
value
on
a
circuit-wide
basis,
which
is,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
argument,
a
benefit
of
the
1292(b)
appeal.
that
in
the
very
limited
circumstance
of
a
very
important
question,
the
benefit
to
be
achieved
from
1292(b)
is
not
only
to
advance
the
litigation
that's
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
also
to
attempt
to
settle
an
unsettled
question
of
law
which
will
have
precedential
value
on
a
circuit-wide
basis.
the
bankruptcy
panels
do
satisfy
that
purpose,
and
thus
the
fact
that
the
appeal
stops
with
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
at
the
interlocutory
level
is
at
least
understandable
and
distinct
from
the
suggestion
that
it
should
stop
at
the
district
court
level,
which
not
only
doesn't
offer
a
panel
or
appellate
review,
but
is
of
little
precedential
value...
in
fact
none,
i
would
suggest...
beyond
the
case
before
the
district
court.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
that
is
the
standard
by
which
the
district
court
must
first
certify
the
appeal
to
even
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
of
appeals
then
has,
in
the
words
of
the
statue,
discretion
to
take
the
appeal,
presumably
if
it
does
not
think
it's
a
controlling
issue
of
law
which
will
advance
the
litigation,
it
will
not
exercise
that
discretion.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
only
in
the
words
of
the
statute
which
address
the
fact
that
it
not
only
be
controlling,
which
presumably
speaks
in
terms
of
that
litigation,
but
that
it
be
a
question
as
to
which
it
is
unsettled.
in
other
words,
the
words,
i
believe
are,
that
there
are
substantial
grounds
for
difference
of
opinion.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
it
has
a
benefit.
yes,
your
honor.
second,
to
pick
up
on
a
point
made
by
my
opponent
in
response
to
a
question,
justice,
about
section
305.
he...
his
response
concerned
the
abstention
orders
which
are
district
court
orders,
and
therefore,
it
does
make
sense
that
the
amendment
in
1990
to
the
abstention
section,
which
is
1334(c),
would
include
1291
and
1292.
most
courts
have
felt
that
1291
and
2
are
still
in
place
for
district-court
originated
bankruptcy
cases.
however,
that
does
not
address
the
section
305,
which
is
the
dismissal
or
suspension
orders,
which
are
clearly
orders
that
can
be
entered
by
a
bankruptcy
court.
when
a
case
has
been
referred
to
it,
certainly
in
the
first
instance,
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
case
would
be
decided
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
that
would
be
under
305.
and
congress,
in
305,
just
as
in
1334,
amended
in
1990
to
add
the
words:
appeals
to
the
courts
of
appeals
under
158(d),
1291,
1292.
it's
a
clear
expression
that
when
congress
addressed
the
issue
of
appellate
review
in
a
bankruptcy
case
originating
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
it
thought
that
an
appeal
would
lie
under
1292,
and
therefore,
when
it
wished
to
bar
appeals,
it
needed
to
list
1292.
ms.
janet
c.
hall
i
don't
think
that's
exactly
correct.
i
believe
that
you
could
have
a
case
in
the
district
court
that
had
not
been
referred
under
157(c).
ms.
janet
c.
hall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
305
would...
could
be
a
district
court
order.
the
issue...
the
respondent's
position
rests
primarily
on
the
redundancy,
the
appearance
of
the
words:
and
district
court.
those
first
appeared
in
section
1293.
and
although
they
were
not
explained
when
they
appeared,
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
1293
when
enacted
and
when
drafted,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
24
and
25
of
my
brief,
you
will
see
that
the
district
court
reference
gets
inserted
by
the
senate
in
subpart
(b)
of
1293.
subpart
(a)
addresses
decisions
of
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panels.
decisions
is
the
words
found
in
1291
of
title
28,
and
are
usually
meant
to
refer
to
final
decisions.
when
the
word
district
court
was
entered
in
(b),
it
could
be
argued
that
they
added
it
because
the
phrases
final
judgment,
order,
and
decree
did
not
appear
in
title
28
anywhere
in
referring
to
district
court
decisions.
now
it's
also
unnecessary
because
rule
54
makes
the
word
judgment
encompass
all
decisions,
orders,
and
decrees.
but
that
could
explain
a
need
to...
or
a
perceived
need
to
insert
the
words
district
court.
it
is
clearly,
as
it
appears
in
158,
a
redundancy.
however,
it
is
an
unexplained
redundancy.
it
is
not
addressed
by
the
congress.
it
does
not
explicitly
state
it's
meant
to
repeal
anything.
and
such
unexplained
reconcilable
redundancies,
not
irreconcilable...
we
don't
have
a
different
result
under
1291
and
158(d)...
do
not
support
a
finding
of
a
congressional
intent
to
repeal
a
preexisting
jurisdictional
grant
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
if
this
is
not
a
repeal
pro
tanto
of
1291
and
1292,
then
that
jurisdictional
grant
found
in
those
two
sections
is
still
in
effect
and
still
applicable,
and
that
the
appeal
below
should
be
entertained.
there
has
been
no
showing
that
congress
meant
to
repeal
that
jurisdictional
grant.
certainly
158
and
its
mere
affirmance
of
existing
jurisdiction
does
not
supply
that
intent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
