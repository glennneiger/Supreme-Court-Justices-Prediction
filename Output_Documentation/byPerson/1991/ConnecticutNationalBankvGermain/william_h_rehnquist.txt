we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1791,
connecticut
national
bank
v.
thomas
m.
germain.
ms.
hall,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
weight
do
you
think
those
pre-bankruptcy
code
enactment
provision...
cases
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
bankruptcy
court
was
tied
much
more
closely
to
the
district
court
before
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
this
in
your
brief,
ms.
hall?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
one
of
the
footnotes
on
34-35
set
forth
the
statute
you're
talking
about
verbatim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
one
on
footnote
on...
the
last
part
of
your
footnote
41?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
hall.
mr.
germain,
we'll
hear
from
you
after
our
noon
recess.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
germain,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mandamus
is
an
extraordinary
remedy,
though,
mr.
germain.
you
know,
our
cases
say
it's
not
available
to
correct
ordinary
errors
at
all.
i
mean,
i
don't
think...
the
fact
that
mandamus
is
available
would
make
it
a
substitute
for
the
right
of
appeal
that
the
petitioner
claims
exists.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
isn't
the
test
for
mandamus
under
our
cases,
an
extraordinary
situation
that
would
cause
great
injustice.
people
may
feel
that
that's
what
it
in
fact
works
out
to
be,
but
certainly
that's
not
the
stated
test.
it's
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
something
approaching
that,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend,
mr.
germain,
that
section
158
covers
the
subject
from
orders
of
bankruptcy
judges,
more
or
less
from
a
to
z,
so
that
you
no
longer
need
1291
or
1292
when
you're
talking
about...
you
can
just
read
158?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
158(d)
wholly
supersedes
1291
and
1292
when
you're
talking
appeal
from
bankruptcy
orders
from
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
germain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
hall,
you
have
15
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
standard
by
which
a
court
of
appeals
decides
to
accept
submission
under
1292(b),
it's
whether
the
issue
would
be
dispositive
in
the
particular
case,
isn't
it?
a
controlling
question
of
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
nothing
indicating
that
a
court
of
appeals
must
look
for
something
of
general
importance
in
that
question
is
there,
beyond
the
particular
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
means
beyond
that
case
it
should
be
something
of
general
importance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hall.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1791,
connecticut
national
bank
versus
germain
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
