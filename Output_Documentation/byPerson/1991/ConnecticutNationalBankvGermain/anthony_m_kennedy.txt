justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
thought.
well,
for
purposes
of
1292(b),
if
the
interlocutory
appeal
is
heard
by
the
bankruptcy
panel,
i
take
it
you
do
have
some
problem
with
1292(b)
because
it
requires
certification
by
a
district
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
only
one
small
question.
do
you
have
bankruptcy
appellate
panels
on
the
second
circuit?
