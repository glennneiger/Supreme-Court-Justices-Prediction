justice
antonin
scalia
you
also
achieve
a
second
interlocutory
appeal.
you
were
mentioning
earlier
that
there's
no
conceivable
reason
why
they
would
have
put
this
in
with
the
purpose
that
your
opponent
asserts.
but
the
very
plausible
reason,
as
the
briefs
point
out,
is
it's
a
terrible
thing
for
a
lawyer
to
have
to
go
through
two
interlocutory
appeals.
you
have
to
go
from
the
bankruptcy
court
to
the
district
court,
all
the
way
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
a
lot
of
trouble.
i
would
agree
with
you
it's
two
steps,
your
honor.
however,
those
two
steps
also
find
a
place
in
the
appeal
from
a
final
order
of
a
bankruptcy
court.
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
scheme
that
congress
settled
upon,
finally
in
1984,
that
its
desire
to
refer
bankruptcy
matters
primarily
and
principally
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
yet
keep
them
attached
to
a
district
court,
necessarily
results
in
that.
yeah,
but
congress
might
have
felt
that
once
is
enough
to
have
to
go
through
all
of
that,
and
that
the
usual
reasons
for
allowing
interlocutory
appeal,
when
there's
only
one,
are
out
weighed
by
the
fact
that
you'd
have
to
do
it
double
if
you
do
it
in
this
area.
i
mean,
it's
at
least
a
plausible
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
germain,
it
seems
to
me
another
response
to
the
seeming
anomaly
of
not
being
able
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
bankruptcy
panel,
although
you
can
take
it
from
the
district
court
under
the
petitioner's
interpretation,
is
that
you
wouldn't
be
before
the
bankruptcy
panel,
except
voluntarily.
you
have
to
accede
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
panel,
and
when
you
do,
you
know
that
one
of
the
things
that
goes
along
with
it
is
that
you
can't
get
an
interlocutory
appeal.
why
isn't
that
fair
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
right,
you'd
still
be
left
with
the
fact
that
you
could
not
take
an
interlocutory
appeal.
but
still
the
fact
that
it's
been
voluntarily
assumed
is
a
basis
for
distinguishing
that
from
the
appeal
from
the
district
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
305
applies
only
to
bankruptcy
courts,
not
to
district
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
that
would
explain
why
you
had
to
refer
to
both
158(d)
and
1295
and
1292,
for
those
cases
that
might
arise...
might
be
coming
up
from
the
district
court.
i
mean,
all
you
need
is
some
case
to
explain
the
reference
to
1291
or
1292.
