justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
there
an
answer
to
that?
namely,
that
you've
got
a
decision
by
three
judges
there,
so
the
need
for
further
review
is
somewhat
less
than
if
you
had
just
one
judge
passing
on
it.
i
mean,
presumably
you
have
three
people
who
have
decided
the
issue,
and
not
providing
for
review
from
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
necessarily
means
they
didn't
intend
to
provide
the
review
that
preexisted
from
a
normal
district
court
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
have
been
necessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
they
repeal
the
normal
1292(b)
review?
what's
the
point
of
doing
that?
i
don't
really
quite
understand
what's
at
work
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
entirely
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they
can
turn
down
the
appeal
in
10
days.
isn't
it
a
10-day
decision...
i
forget...
the
1292(b)?
don't
they
act
on
a
petition
within
10
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
every
now
and
then
there
is
a
very
important
issue
that
arises
in
an
interlocutory
posture.
and
if
you
can't
review...
get
it
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
until
you
finish
the
entire
bankruptcy
proceeding,
maybe
that's
counterproductive
in
some
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
doesn't
it
make
more
sense
to
say,
well,
leave
it
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
they
can
identify
those
that
are
important
and
dismiss
those
that
are
just
dilatory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
was
the
reason,
they
surely
could
have
done
it
more
direct
language
than
they
did.
you
don't
normally
restrict
by
authorizing.
i
mean,
it
speaks
in
terms
of
authorizing
review,
not
foreclosing
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
because
it's
already
authorized.
that's
why--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--partial
repeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it's
partial
repeal
to
the
extent
that
1292(b)
applied
in
bankruptcy
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
normally
talk
about
one
federal
statute
preempting
another
federal
statute.
it
either
repeals
it
or
it
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
preempts
state
law
or
other
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
germain,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
understand
either
the
statute
or
what
you
were
telling
me
about
it.
with
respect
to
158(b)(1),
the
panel,
the
section
authorizes
appeals
to
panels
consisting
of
three
bankruptcy
judges,
what
is
your
view
as
to
where
an
appeal
from
an
order
by
the
panel
of
three
judges
goes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
correct
that
158(d)
was
necessary
to
take
care
of
appeals
from
that
panel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
goes...
and
there's...
ironically,
though,
that
is
treated
as
an
order
of
the
district
court,
is
it,
when
the
three-judge...
three-bankruptcy-judge
panel
resolves
an
appeal
from--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
so
you
don't
really
have
to
decide
whether
it's
a
direct
appeal
from
bankruptcy
judges
or
from
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
does
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
