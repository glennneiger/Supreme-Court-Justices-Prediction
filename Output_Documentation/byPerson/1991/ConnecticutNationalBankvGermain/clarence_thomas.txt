justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
respondent
thomas
m.
germain,
trustee
for
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt
o'sullivan
fuel
oil
company,
sued
petitioner,
connecticut
national
bank,
for
assorted
torts
and
breaches
of
contract.
connecticut
national
bank
moved
to
strike
germain's
demand
for
a
jury
trial.
the
bankruptcy
court
denied
the
motion
and
the
district
court
affirmed.
connecticut
national
bank
then
attempted
to
appeal
to
the
second
circuit
but
the
court
dismissed
holding
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
interlocutory
decisions
rendered
by
the
district
court
acting
as
an
appellate
court
in
bankruptcy.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
tittle
28
section
1292
of
the
united
states
code
provides
for
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
of
appeals
over
interlocutory
orders
of
the
district
courts.
we
see
nothing
in
the
language
of
this
or
any
other
statute
that
limits
congress'
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
any
particular
subset
of
such
orders.
because
the
order
of
the
district
court
affirming
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court
is
within
the
language
of
section
1292,
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
exercised
jurisdiction
over
connecticut
national
bank's
appeal.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
o'connor
also
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
white
and
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
