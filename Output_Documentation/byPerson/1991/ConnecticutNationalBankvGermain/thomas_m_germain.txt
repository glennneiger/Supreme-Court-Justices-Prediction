mr.
thomas
m.
germain
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe,
and
it's
the
respondent's
position,
that
his
whole
case
revolves
around
the
fact
that
if
the
petitioner's
position
is
accepted,
there
was
no
reason
for
congress
to
enact
section
158(d)
insofar
as
it
applied
to
district
court
jurisdiction.
and
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
do
is
address
myself
to
justice
o'connor's
question
that
was
directed
to
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner.
when
justice
o'connor
asked
what
reason
there
would
be
for
the
passage
of
this
statute,
opposing
counsel
indicated
that
158(d)
did
cover
the
situation
for
appeals
of
the
bankruptcy
panels
created
in
section
158(b).
i
would
suggest
that
first
of
all,
that
is
no
reason
for
including
district
court
jurisdiction
in
section
158(d).
and
in
fact,
it
raises
a
situation
in
which
if
the
petitioner's
argument
is
accepted,
a
strange
situation
is
created
in
that
1292,
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
for
circuit
court
jurisdiction
of
interlocutory
appeals
for
the
district
court,
does
not
cover
such
decisions
by
that
bankruptcy
panel
created
in
section
158(b).
so
you
have
a
situation
where
if
the
petitioner's
argument
is
accepted,
you
may
have
review
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
interlocutory
orders
from
the
district
court.
but
if
there
is
a
district
in
which
the
bankruptcy
panel
under
158(b)
has
been
created,
1292
under
its
plain
language
would
not
cover
that
situation.
and
in
fact,
that
was
recognized
by
the
second
circuit
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
i
believe,
first
of
all,
that
there
is
still
a
review
by
the
district
court.
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
fact
that's
one
judge
or
three
judges
would
be
that
important.
and
secondly,
that
still
doesn't
respond
to
the
situation
that
158(d)
does
also
include
district
court
jurisdiction.
if
in
fact
it
was
congress'
intent
when
it
passed
1578(d)
just
to
provide
for
appeals
from
the
panels
created
in
158(b),
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
include
the
district
court
in
that
section.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
well,
there
is
no
specific
reason
that
was
set
forth
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history.
that's
conceded;
it's
just
not
there.
but
i
think
there
are
reasons.
you're
dealing
with
in
section
158,
no
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that...
or
the
district
court
that's
covered
by
1292,
but
you're
dealing
with
bankruptcy
matters.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
recognized
policy
in
bankruptcy
matters
to
encourage
their
expeditious
administration.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
and
in
fact,
if
you
permit
interlocutory...
appeals
of
interlocutory
orders
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
policy
may
be
restricted
because--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--certainly,
but
it
may
have
been
congress'
intent
that
they
didn't
even
want
to
subject
the
bankruptcy
court
administration
or
the
bankruptcy
court
estate
to
the
possibility
that
that
would
have
to
undergo
this
additional
review
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
certainly.
in
any
individual
case,
no
matter
what
rule
you
adopt,
you're
going
to
have
individual
cases
where
that
rule
may
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
first
of
all,
i
think
this
case
is
still
governed
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reason...
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
to
get
into
intent,
even,
because
there
is
no
reason
for
158(d)
to
be
passed,
if
in
fact
it
wasn't
meant
to
restrict
the
appellate
court
review.
of
the
reasons
that
i
addressed
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--that's
correct,
but
it
speaks
only
to
final
orders
judgments
in
section
158(d).
there
is
no
reference
to
an
interlocutory
order
in
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
in
fact,
if
they
wanted
to
have
these
type
of
appeals
of
interlocutory
orders,
they
simply
either
could
have
included
the
language
of
interlocutory
orders
in
that
section,
or
simply
not
have
passed
it
at
all.
and
in
fact,
even
though
the
court's
argument
may
have
some
possibility,
i
think
it's
much
more
likely,
given
the
structure
of
the
statutes
and
the
language
that
are
contained
in
it,
that
in
fact
this
was
intended
not
as
a
repeal
of
section
1292,
but
as
more
of
a
preemption
of
it
to
handle
appeals
in
the
specific
matter.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
partial
repeal,
preemption,
whatever
it
is
that...
petitioner's
brief
speaks
a
great
deal
about
the
high
standard
that
the
court
has
to
find
when
a
statute
repeals
another
statute
and
doesn't
do
it
explicitly.
i
don't
think
that's
the
case
in
this
situation.
in
fact,
1291
and
1292
cover
a
lot
of
situations
that
don't
involve
bankruptcy.
and
in
fact,
if
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
is
accepted
as
far
as
what
the
meaning
of
158(d)
is,
you're
not
going
to
have
a
repeal
of
section
1291
or
1292.
it's
still
going
to
apply
to
all
of
those
situations
that
don't
involve
bankruptcy.
all
you're
talking
about--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--it
may
be
just
a
matter
of
semantics,
whether
it's
repeal
or
preemption.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
yes,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--in
this
case,
the
fact
that
it's
only
a
partial
repeal
and
not
a
total
repeal,
as
that
involved
the
cases
that
we
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
support
of
the
statutory
rule
of
interpretation,
i
think,
would
limit
the
effect
or
limit
the
burden
that
the
respondent
has
in
order
to
overcome
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
still
wouldn't
resolve
the
situation
where
if
this
issue
was
important
enough--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--it
may
be,
but
it
still
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
why
158(d)
includes
district
court
jurisdiction
in
addition
to
the
jurisdiction
for
the
interlocutory
panels.
another
reason
that
was
relied
upon
a
great
deal
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
itself
would
support
its
position,
that
1292
does
provide
for
interlocutory
appeal
of
district
court
orders.
in
fact,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
standard,
or
this
rule
of
interpretation,
doesn't
apply
in
this
case.
normally,
when
that
rule
of
interpretation
is
applied
to
a
statute,
you're
talking
about
considering
factors
outside
of
statutory
language
when
interpreting
a
statute,
such
as
legislative
history.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
what
the
petitioner
is
asking
you
to
do
is
not
to
ignore
legislative
history
or
factors
outside
of
the
statutory
language,
but
is
actually
asking
you
to
ignore
other
statutes
itself.
the
interpretation
that
is
advanced
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
not
based
upon,
or
not
relied
primarily
upon
legislative
history
outside
factors.
it's
relied
upon
12...
the
language
of
1292,
when
that
is
considered
with
the
plain
language
of
section
158(d).
the
whole
basis
of
the
argument
advanced
by
the
respondent
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
no
reason
for
congress
to
pass
158(d)
as
far
as
it
applied
to
district
court
jurisdiction
if
1292
is
going
to
apply
also.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
you're
trying
to
bring
things
in
outside
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
in
order
to
advance
an
interpretation,
but
you're
relying
upon
other
statutes
that
is
contained
in
the
united
states
code.
what
the
petitioner
asks
you
to
do
is
to
take
1292,
set
it
aside
by
itself,
and
read
it
without
any
relation
to
any
of
the
other
statutes.
and
i
think
the
rule
of
interpretation
that
is
advanced
to
support
that
is
not
relevant
to
that
particular
situation.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
305...
i
think
the
argument
that's
made
by
the
petitioner
in
their
case
is
that
305(c)
is
inconsistent
with
the
respondent's
position.
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
305
concerns
orders
for
abstention,
and
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
those
type
or
orders
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
cases
that
have
considered
158(d)
as
far
as
it
relates
to
1292
have
made
it
clear
that
158(d)
does
not
limit
appeals
to
the
circuit
of
appeals
in
a
situation
where
the
district
court
is
acting
as
the
original
court
of
jurisdiction
for
a
bankruptcy
matter.
in
fact,
the
district
court
would
be
entitled,
as
the
original
court
of
jurisdiction,
to
enter
an
order
under
305.
so
if
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
not
to
permit
these
appeals,
in
order
to
cover
a
situation
where
the
district
court
was
acting
as
the
original
court
of
jurisdiction,
they
would
have
had
to
include
1291
and
1292
in
there
in
addition
to
158.
so
in
fact,
including
those
in
there
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
respondent's
position.
it's
simply
to
cover
the
situation
when
the
district
court
is
sitting
as
the
original
court
of
jurisdiction
for
a
bankruptcy
matter.
another
amended
basis
of
the
petitioner's
arguments
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
congress,
or
to
expect
congress
to
have
wanted
to
accomplish
this
by
the
passage
of
158(d)
because
of
the
way
or
because
of
the
result
that
they
would
result
in.
the
fact
that
there
are
matters
that
are
important
enough
that
you
may
want
interlocutory
review
of
appellate...
of
interlocutory
orders
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
you're
not
going
to
have
that
if
the
respondent's
position
is
accepted.
i
would
suggest
that
when
you
look
at
the
law
concerning
what
concerns
or
what
involves
a
final
decision
in
the
bankruptcy
matter,
and
also
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
does
have
the
right
to
obtain
jurisdiction
over
these
type
of
orders
by
writ
of
mandamus
that
any
detrimental
effect
by
the
adoption
of
the
respondent's
position,
as
far
as
how
this
statute
is
interpreted,
is
going
to
be
limited.
bankruptcy
matters
are
generally
different
than
regular
litigation
matters
in
that
you
don't
have
two
parties
that
are--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--absolutely
not.
it
would
not
be
a
substitute.
what
i
believe
that
the
respondent
is
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
reasons,
other
reasons
that
congress
may
have
wanted
to
limited
the
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
these
interlocutory
orders,
and
that
in
an
extraordinary
situation
where
this
would
cause
a
great
injustice,
that
writ
is
available.
if
there
were
policy
reasons
where
congress
would
do
this,
then
it
would
be
reasonable
for
congress
to
adopt
section
158
and
give
it
the
interpretation
that's
advanced
by
the
respondent.
i
think
the
court
would
be
concerned
about
an
extraordinary
situation
where
that
would
cause
a
great
injustice.
and
in
that
situation,
the
writ
of
mandamus
would
be
available
to
remedy
it.
but
i
am
not
advancing
the
argument
that
this
is
a
substitute
in
any
situation.
that
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
these,
certainly
saying
that
there
is
a
substitute
for
it
would
be
completely
counter
to
my
arguments.
what
this
is
is
that
a
concern
that
there
may
be
an
extraordinary
situation
that
would
cause
a
great
injustice
can
be
resolved
by
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
well,
i
think
effect
of
the
result
of
the
failure
to
have
that
appeal
is
a
consideration
in
issuing
a
writ
of
mandamus,
even
though
that
is
not
the
only
consideration.
and
as
again,
i'm
not
advancing
this
as
substitute
for
appellate
court
jurisdiction
of
interlocutory
orders.
it's
simply
a
minimization
of
any
substantial
detriment
that
may
result
from
in
fact
not
providing
for
this
appellate
court
review.
i
would
again
further
suggest
that
we
are
only
speaking
about
the
appellate
review
of
interlocutory
orders.
this
is
not
a
denial
of
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
in
order
to
review
these
decisions
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
it
simply
means
that
you
have
to
wait
to
the
end
of
the
case
in
order
to
do
that.
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
doing
that.
even
though
it
is
recognized
by
the
court
that
there
are
reasons
for
permitting
appeals
of
interlocutory
orders,
it
was
also
recognized
that
there
is
a
cost
to
this.
this
cost
may
be
magnified
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
bankruptcy
estate,
where
there
are
important
policies
for
encouraging
expeditious
administration
of
it.
and
in
fact,
by
only
permitting
review
or
appellate
review
of
final
decisions
rather
than
interlocutory
decisions,
you
have
situations
where
because
of
many
reasons
these
reviews
may
not
become
necessary
for
the
bankruptcy
estate,
or
a
situation
where
if
the
bankruptcy
estate
is
forced
to
appeal
this
issue,
at
least
it
can
go
up
to
the
level
and
have
all
of
the
issues
resolved,
rather
than
trying
to
do
it
on
a
piecemeal
basis.
in
this
case,
if
there
is
a
final
decision
in
this
and
there
is
a
subsequent
appeal,
the
bankruptcy
estate
would
have
been
forced
to
go
up
through
the
appellate
process
twice,
instead
of
simply
having
all
of
the
issues
presented
at
one
time,
with
the
saving
of
time
and
expense
to
the
bankruptcy
estate.
and
again,
i
don't
think
that
my
argument
is
really
necessary...
it's
necessary
to
find
that
these
policy
reasons
are
valid,
or
in
fact,
stronger
than
any
policy
reasons
that
are
advanced
by
the
petitioner.
really,
the
basis
of
the
argument
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
no
reason
for
158(d)
to
be
passed
if
you
accept
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of.
these
policy
reasons
that
i'm
presenting
to
the
court
are
simply
to
counter
the
arguments
presented
by
the
petitioner
and
suggested
in
other
cases
or
in
other
court
of
appeals
that
have
considered
this
issue,
that
in
fact
it
may
be
unreasonable
to
find
the
interpretation
advanced
by
the
respondent
because
there
is
no
reason
for
it.
there
are
reasons
for
it,
and
therefore,
i
think
that
even
though
the
basis
of
it
is
the
structure
of
158(d)
and
the
fact
that
there's
no
reason
to
have
passed
it
without...
if
the
petitioner's
argument
is
accepted,
these
arguments
do
counter
the
petitioner's
argument
and
the
court
of
appeal
arguments
that
are
presented,
that
there
was
no
reason
for
doing
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
no,
it
does
apply...
well,
it
does
apply
to
all
orders
that
are
issued
by
bankruptcy
judges.
158(a)
says
that
all
orders
by
bankruptcy
judges
have
to
be
appealed
to
the
district
court,
whether
they
are
interlocutory
or
final
orders.
the
question
is...
and
all
ordered
by
the
bankruptcy
court
are
covered
by
that.
the
question
is,
is
then
once
you
get
to
the
district
court,
what
happens
after
that?
now
the
argument
by
the
petitioner
is
that
1291
and
1292
would
cover
that,
as
well
as
158(d),
and
there's...
if
you
just
consider
that
without...
if
158(d)
had
never
been
passed,
there
may
have
been
some
merit
to
that
argument.
you
go
from
the
bankruptcy
court
to
the
district
court
under
158(a),
then
1291
and
1292
take
over
and
govern
the
further
appeals
of
that.
and
in
fact
if
congress
has
never
passed
158(d),
that
would
be
the
obvious
system
that
you
would
adopt
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
problem
with
it
is,
is
that
instead
of
just
leaving
that
the
way
it
was,
congress
in
fact
did
pass
158(d).
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
yes.
to
the...
two
reasons
for
that.
it
supersedes
1291,
which
really
doesn't
have
great
effect,
because
basically
all
it
does
is
repeat
1291.
you
can't
obtain
the
same
thing
that's
stated
in
1291
because
you
do
appeals
of
final
judgments
and
orders
from
the
bankruptcy
court
that
go
up
to
the
district
court.
my
argument
is,
is
that
it
supersedes
1292
because
it
didn't
mention
interlocutory
orders
in
that.
they
both...
it
is
relevant
because
first
of
all
they
found
it
necessary
to
repeat
1291.
it
wasn't
congress'
intent
to
replace
the
system
that
was
set
up
by
1291
and
1292
by
158.
it
wouldn't
have
been
any
reason
to
repeat
158,
because
1291
would
have
covered
it,
and
therefore,
the
natural
presumption
of
that
is
that
1292
also
doesn't
apply.
and
since
interlocutory
orders
aren't
provided
in
158(d),
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
for
those
type
of
cases.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
as
far
as
a
final
judgment,
it
would
go
to
the
second
circuit.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
that's
correct.
and
that's
provided
for
in
158(d).
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
find
that.
158(d)
says
any
orders
that
are
entered
under
158(a)
or
158(b)
can
be
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
that's
correct.
it
is
authorized
specifically--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--yes,
it's
clear
that
158(d)
does
provide
for
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
well,
that's
correct.
i
mean,
the
plain
language
of
1292(b)
only
applies
to
district
court.
now
there
was
a
position
raised
by
this
court
that
the
fact
that
it's
voluntary
may
be
reason
why
we
don't
allow
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
fact
is,
is
that
1292(b)
clearly
by
the
plain
language
of
it
would
not
provide
for
the
interlocutory...
appeal
of
an
interlocutory
order
up
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
further
support
for
the
respondent's
position
is
also
found
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
158's
predecessor,
section
1293.
even
though
1293
never
became
effective
during
the
time
that
it
was
enacted,
in
fact,
it
is
clear
from
the
courts
that
have
considered
it
that
1293
was
basically
a
predecessor
of
158,
and
that
the
legislative
history,
in
cases
interpreting
that,
can
be
applied
to
158.
the
legislative
history
was
specifically
set
out
in
detail
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
opinion,
which
noted
that
in
fact
the
version
of
that
statute
immediately
prior
to
its
passage
did
not
have
any
provision
as
it
was
contained
in
section
158(d),
which
provided
for
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
only
final
judgments,
orders,
or
decrees.
and
in
fact,
that
was
added
later
on.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
though
this
is
no
where
near
as
important
as
the
original
argument
for
my
interpretation,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
reason
to
pass
158(d)
if
you
provide
for
appellate
coverage
under
1292,
it
adds
further
support
to
the
respondent's
position.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i--
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
--no,
we
do
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
germain
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
