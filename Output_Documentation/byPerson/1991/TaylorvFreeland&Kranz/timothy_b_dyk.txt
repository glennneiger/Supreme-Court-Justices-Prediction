mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
chapter
7
bankruptcy
case
is
whether
section
522(1)
of
the
code,
which
provides
for
the
raising
of
challenges
to
exemptions,
in
combination
with
bankruptcy
rule
4003,
which
generally
requires
that
that
objection
be
made
within
30
days
after
the
meeting
of
creditors,
is
an
absolute
bar
as,
the
third
circuit
held
in
this
case,
to
a
challenge
to
the
exemption
raised
at
a
later
time.
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
this
issue.
there
are
three
different
positions
that
the
lower
federal
courts
have
taken.
one
represented
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
case,
which
held
that
the
30-day
period
is
an
absolute
bar,
a
second
line
of
cases
that
the
court
at
a
later
time
can
reexamine
the
exemption
de
novo,
and
a
third
line
of
cases
holding
that
after
the
30-day
period
the
exemption
may
be
challenged
if
it
lacks
a
good
faith
statutory
basis.
we
are
urging
in
this
case
that
the
court
adopt
this
third
position,
which
is
represented
by
decisions
of
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
eighth
circuits.
in
a
bankruptcy
case
the
first
act
is
the
filing
of
the
petition
by
the
debtor,
and
at
the
same
time
that
the
petition
is
filed
the
debtor
will
also
file
a
schedule
of
assets
and
a
list
of
claimed
exemptions,
and
in
this
case
when
the
petition
was
filed
on
october
24th,
1984,
the
debtor
made
a
claim
of
exemption
for
a
lawsuit
which
she
had
pending
against
twa,
and
she
characterized
it
in
the
schedules
as
a
claim
for
lost
wages
with
the
value
unknown.
at
that
time,
the
case
had
wound
its
way
through
the
state
system.
she
had
been
successful
in
convincing
the
commonwealth
court
to
affirm
a
judgment
in
her
favor,
and
the
case
had
been
briefed
and
argued
before
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
within
the
time
allowed
in
the
code,
the
trustee
appointed
by
the
court,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
held
a
meeting
of
creditors
as
he
was
required
to
do
and
examined
the
debtor
about
her
assets,
and
in
particular
about
this
claim,
and
noted
at
the
time
that
this
was
a
possible
asset
case,
meaning
there
were
possible
assets
here
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
creditors,
that
asset
being
the
claim
against
twa,
and
shortly
after
the
meeting
of
creditors
he
wrote
to
counsel
for
the
debtor
and
advised
them
that
he
considered
this
claim
to
be
an
asset
of
the
estate,
i.e.,
that
he
considered
it
to
be
nonexempt.
the
claim
continued
and
ultimately
was
resolved
by
settlement
in
favor
of
the
debtor,
and
she
collected
approximately
$110,000,
and
the
question
now
is,
the
case
having
remained
open
for
this
time
for
the
express
purpose
of
pursuing
this
claim,
whether
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
can
now
go
after
these
proceeds,
which
were
allowed
to
him
in
the
amount
of
$23,000
here
by
the
bankruptcy
court...
can
go
after
these
proceeds
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
creditors.
now,
the
contention
is
by
the
respondents
and
the
holding
of
the
third
circuit
is
that
that
is
not
permissible
because
section
522(1)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
says
that
if
there's
no
objection
filed
within
30
days
after
the
creditors
meeting
that
the
property
claimed
as
exempt
is
exempt.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
in
the
code,
in
522(1)
of
the
code.
the
time
period...
30-day
time
period
is
not
specified
in
the
code
but
in--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes,
that's
in
bankruptcy
rule
4003.
it
specifies
the
30-day
period.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
we
have
only
pursued
a
portion
of
it,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
only
allowed
a
portion
of
it
to
be
reached,
the
$23,000,
but
i
think
that
at
the
time
that
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
filed
that
there
was
a
strong
argument
that
all
of
that
could
be
reached,
even
the
part
covered
by
attorney's
fees,
because
there
was
no
equitable
lien
with
respect
to
the
claim
itself,
but
only
an
equitable
lien
under
state
law
that
would
have
arisen
after
the
proceeds
were
received.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
judgment
of
this
court
would
only
determine
a
portion
of
it,
and
we're
only
claiming
the
right
to
the
$23,000.
the
claims
of
the
creditors
in
this
case
were
only
$11,000,
so
the
$23,000
will
be
sufficient
to
cover
that
and
the
administrative
expenses.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
that
was
not
argued
in
the
court
below.
it
has
come
up
in
some
other
cases,
but
it
was
not
argued
in
the
court
below
here.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
we
believe
that's
appropriate,
because
what
the
second
sentence
of
section
105(a)
says
is
that
no
provision
of
the
code
shall
be
construed
to
prevent
a
challenge
based
on
an
abuse
of
process,
and
the
question
of
whether
522(1)
was
a
bar
to
the
trustee's
claim
here
was
something
that
was
heatedly
contested
in
the
lower
court,
and
we're
merely
saying
in
this
court
that
section
105(a)
instructs
as
to
how
to
interpret
section
522(1).
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
abuse
of
process
in
the
common
law
sense,
but
if
you
look
at
prosser
or
the
restatement
of
torts,
abuse
of
process
in
the
common
law
sense
would
be,
for
example,
using
a
writ
of
sequestration
to
get
property
or
the
improper
issuance
of
criminal
process,
or
the
use
of
process
to
commence
an
improper
civil
action.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
it
is
an
abuse
of
process
not
in
the
common
law
sense
but
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
used
the
term
abuse
of
process,
for
example,
in
the
cooter
&
gell
case.
what
is
involved
here
in
section
105(a)
is
not
the
conferring
of
a
right
of
action
on
the
trustee
or
the
party
of
interest.
it's
not
conferring
a
common
law
right
of
action,
it's
simply
saying
that
the
time
limits
of
the
code
will
not
be
enforced
if
there's
an
abuse
of
process.
i
think
there
are
some
interesting
comparisons
that
can
be
made
between
these
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
that
govern
here
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
in
some
respects
that's
a
rather
exact
parallel.
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
if
a
complaint
is
filed
and
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
not
controverted
under
rule
8(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
to
be
taken
as
true,
and
i
think
one
could
look
at
522(1)
as
essentially
saying
the
same
thing,
that
if
a
claim
is
made
for
an
exemption
and
there's
no
timely
objection
to
that,
that
the
exemption
will
be
taken
as
established,
but
just
as
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter,
so,
too,
we
suggest
that
under
the
bankruptcy
code
that's
not
the
end
of
the
matter,
either.
in
other
words,
that
merely
because
you
file
a
late
answer
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
come
in
and
give
relief
from
a
default
later
on
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
chief
justice,
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
term
abuse
of
process
was
used
here
in
the
common
law
sense.
we
suggest
that
it
was
meant--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--the
claim
is
that
the
abuse
of
process
was
the
act
of
filing
the
list
of
exemptions
and
making
a
claim
of
exemption
that
did
not
have
a
good
faith
statutory
basis.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
not
of
the
common
law,
but
within
the
scope
of
section
105(a).
there's
no...
we
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
section
105(a)
there's
no
question
but
that
in
dispensing
with
these
time
limits
where
there's
an
abuse
of
process
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
situation
in
which
improper
claims
or
claims
without
reasonable
basis--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
second
sentence,
which
refers
to
no
provision
of
this
title
providing
for
the
raising
of
an
issue
by
a
party
in
interest,
shall
be
construed
to
preclude
the
court
from
sua
sponde
taking
any
action
or
making
any
determination
necessary
or
appropriate
to
prevent
an
abuse
of
process.
the
language
of
that
sentence
suggests
to
us
that
what
they
were
talking
about
was
a
concern
with
the
time
limits
in
the
code
and
the
language
fits
rather
exactly
with
section
522(1),
and
what
they
are
suggesting
is
that
the
time
limit
would
result
in
an
abuse
of
process
in
the
sense
of
a
bad
faith
claim,
or
something
of
that
sort,
that
the
claim
would
have
power
to
excuse.
we
don't
think
that
section
105(a)
really
made
any
change
with
respect
to
the
inherent
powers
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
in
this
area,
and
in
fact
there
is
authority
that
even
before
this
provision
in
the
code,
even
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act,
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
did
have
equitable
powers
in
this
area
to
do
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
are
urging
should
be
done
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
front
pay,
to
the
extent
it's
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
debtor,
would
be
exempt.
back
pay
is
not
exempt.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
if
that
were
the
case,
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
that
the
record
pretty
clearly
establishes
first
of
all
that
the
claim
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
filing
was
worth
$110,000
and
the
later
calculations
made
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
show
that
only
approximately
even
as
of
that
time
only
about
30
percent
of
that
claim
was
for
front
pay
as
opposed
to
back
pay.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it
would
be
exempt
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
claim
for
front
pay,
but
after
all
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
the
award
of
the
pittsburgh
human
relations
commission
that
was
being
defended
had
a
provision
in
it
that
she
would
recover
from
the
time
that
she
was
discriminated
against
up
until
the
time
that
her
class
of
supervisor
was
no
longer
employed
by
twa
in
pittsburgh,
and
that
was
a
date
before
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
so
if
you
just
looked
at
the
human
relations
commission
decision
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
award
of
front
pay
but
merely
an
award
of
back
pay
for
the
period
before
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
that
there
can
be
situations
in
which
it
is
complex,
but
it
is
not
such
an
unusual
thing,
after
all,
under
rule
11,
and
there
is
an
equivalent
of
rule
11
in
the
bankruptcy
rules
which
is
section
9011
that
the
courts
routinely
make
this
kind
of
determination
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
claims
have
a
reasonable
basis.
that
is
essentially
the
standard
that
we
are
urging
here
that
ought
to
be
applied
under
section
522
and
section
105(a).
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
are
inundated
with
this
filings.
last
year
there
were
880,000
bankruptcy
filings,
291
bankruptcy
judges
to
deal
with
all
of
those
filings,
and
a
real
need
on
the
part
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
rely
on
the
good
faith
of
debtors
in
claiming
exemptions,
otherwise
the
whole
system
would
collapse.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
all
of
the
chapter
7
filings
would
involve
a
trustee
and
the
vast--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--which
is
this
one,
and
the
vast--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--the
trustees
have
been
pretty
inundated,
too,
even--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--even--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
the...
justice--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
is
correct.
the
creditors
would
not
have
objected.
you're
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
there
was
$11,000
in
claims.
no
creditor
has
a
sufficient
monetary
incentive
to
raise
an
objection
or
to
investigate
the
case.
they
rely
on
the
trustee--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
it's
not
the
creditors,
it's
the
bankruptcy
trustee
who's--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--he
did
not
do
what
he
should
have
done
in
the
technical
sense,
but
what
he
did
was
immediately
after
the
meeting
of
creditors
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
debtor's
counsel
handling
this
twa
case
for
her
and
advised
them
specifically
of
his
position.
this
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
trustee
laid
back
and
did
not
inform
people
of
his
position,
and
the
case
was
specifically
kept
open
for
this
purpose.
there
was
not
technical
compliance
with
the
bankruptcy
rules
in
the
sense
that
there
was
an
objection
filed
with
the
court,
but
everybody
knew
what
the
trustee's
position
was
at
the
time,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
was
made
aware
of
it,
too,
but
these
kinds
of
slip-ups
are
going
to
occur
when
you
have
this
many
bankruptcy
proceedings.
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
going
on,
the
trustee
here
had
approximately
two
or
three
hundred
of
these
cases
a
year,
which
i
think
is
typical
of
bankruptcy
trustees
all
across
the
country.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
filed
it
within
the
context
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
it's
a
so-called
adversary
proceeding
within
the
context
of
the
bankruptcy,
and
the
bankruptcy
was
not
closed
at
the
time
that
this
claim
was
asserted
in
the
adversary
proceeding.
essentially
what
he
was
doing
was--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes.
the
bankruptcy
judge
ruled
on
it
and
determined
that
the
exemption
should
be
invalidated
to
the
extent
of
$2,300.
he
did
not
agree
with
the
trustee's
position
to
invalidate
the
whole
$110,000
of
the
settlement.
he
said
i'm
going
to
exercise
discretion,
i'm
only
going
to
set
aside
the
exemption
to
the
extent
of
$23,000
and
not
the
whole
settlement.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
would
think
it
would
only
apply
while
the
proceeding
was
still
open.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
if
you
look
at
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
as
being
parallel
to
ordinary
civil
proceedings
in
the
federal
courts
the
filing
of
the
petition
is
like
a
complaint,
the
objection
to
the
exemption
is
like
the
answer,
and
then
the
closing
of
the
case
is
like
final
judgment
in
the
case,
so
if
after
the
closing
of
the
case
there
were
a
desire
to
reopen
the
judgment
in
a
sense,
one
would
have
to
proceed
under
the
bankruptcy
rule.
it's
equivalent
to
rule
60(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
that
rule
is
bankruptcy
rule
9024,
but...
and
there's
another
rule,
5010,
which
provides
for
the
reopening
of
closed
cases,
but
in
other
words
you
would
have
to
take
this
additional
step
of
trying
to
reopen
the
case
before
you
could
challenge
the
exemption.
one
might
look
at
the
effort
to
challenge
the
exemption
before
the
closure
of
the
case
as
similar
to
an
effort
to
set
aside
a
default
within
the
federal
rules
context
relying
on
rule
55.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
the
case
could
be
opened
without
a
very
substantial
showing.
i
mean,
it's
like
the
reopening
of
a
judgment
under
rule
60(b),
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
significant
showing
and
i'm
also--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--a
significant--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
under
rule
60(b)
you
could...
after
the
1-year
period
after
the
judgment
you
could
only
reopen
the
judgment
for
a
showing
of
fraud.
mere
bad
faith
wouldn't
be
sufficient.
now,
it's
true
that
under
the
bankruptcy
rule
and
the
bankruptcy
code
they
don't
have
the
same
strict
time
limits
of
rule
60(b),
but
we
would
agree,
and
i
think
that
the
interpretation
of
the
rules
and
cases
would
support
that,
that
this
would
have
to
be
within
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
i--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
the
showing
of
good
cause
similar
to
what
appears
in
rule
55,
the
default
provision
of
the
federal
rules,
would
be
an
appropriate
gloss
on
this,
and
if
you
look
back
to
the
equity
practice
before
the
adoption
of
rule
55,
which
would
govern
both
the
bankruptcy
courts
and
federal
courts,
i
think
there
would
need
to
be
some
showing
of
good
cause
necessary
for
that
kind
of
reopening.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
unless
you
can
rely
on
105
or
equity
practice
to
reopen
it.
i
mean,
it's
just
like
8(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
says
if
you
don't
controvert
an
allegation
it's
taken
as
admitted.
if
you
don't
controvert
the
exemption
it's
taken
as
admitted
after
30
days,
but
our
suggestion
is
that
that
does
not
restrict
the
power
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
come
in
after
the
30-day
period
and
to
reopen
where
there's
a
showing
of
good
cause
and
bad
faith.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
we
agree
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
gloss.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
even
when
no
reopening
is
necessary.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
we
would,
i
think...
one
could
look
at
the
parallel
in
rule
55
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
has
a
good
cause
requirement
in
it
to
set
aside
a
default
before
the
entry
of
judgment,
and
the
good
cause
requirement
under
rule
55
is
interpreted
as
being
essentially
a
three-part
test,
that
there
be
a
meritorious
defense,
no
prejudice
to
the
other
party
and
no
bad
faith
by
the
party
seeking
to
reopen
the
judgment,
and
so
we
would
suggest
that
that
might
be
the
way
that
good
cause
would
be
defined,
and
if
that
were
defined
in
that
way,
we
would
think
that
the
trustee
in
this
case
would
easily
satisfy
it.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
we're
suggesting
that
we
import
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
into
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
i
think
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
are
two
bases
here
for
reading
522(1)
as
not
being
an
absolute
bar.
one
is
the
specific
language
of
section
105(a),
which
allows
the
courts
to
dispense...
expressly
allows
the
courts
to
dispense
with
the
time
limits
where
there's
an
abuse
of
process,
and
that
in
turn
is
based
on
the
historic
equity
powers
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
reopen
while
the
case
is
still
pending
based
on
a
showing
of
good
cause.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
it's
not
so...
the
suggestion
that
i'm
making,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
so
foreign
to
the
bankruptcy
code.
section
9006
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
is
a
very
close
parallel
and
was
modeled
after
rule
6
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
it
is
rule
9006
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
the
respondents
are
relying
on
here
to
say
that
the
court
cannot
extend
the
time
for
filing
the
objections
after
the
30-day
time
period
has
run,
so
there
is
an
exact
parallel
here
between--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
the
reference
point
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
the
provisions
of
section
105,
which
for
a
long
time
have
confirmed
the
continuing
power
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
act
as
courts
of
equity.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
specific
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
be
imported
in
here
and
applied
to
bankruptcy.
i'm
simply
saying
that
those
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
some
extent
are
modeled
after
the
old
equity
practice
in
that
quite
apart
from
the
second
sentence
of
section
105(a)
the
bankruptcy
courts
retain
these
inherent
equitable
powers
to
reexamine
actions
that
were
taken
in
the
course
of
proceedings.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
justice
white.
i
think
that
the...
if
there
was
egregious--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
there's
no
question
that
he
should
have
filed--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--why
didn't
he?
i
think
there
were
two
reasons:
one,
he
wasn't
convinced
that
the
debtor's
representations
that
there
was
a
valuable
claim
here
were
correct,
and
second,
while
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
my
understanding
is
that
the
practice
at
that
time
in
that
district
was
the
trustees
voiced
their
objections
by
notations
at
the
meeting
of
creditors
rather
than
the
filing
of
formal
objections.
that
wasn't
consistent
with
the
rules,
but
it
is
an
explanation
as
to
why
he
proceeded
in
this
way
rather
than
in
the
correct
way.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
did
disregard
the
rule,
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
he
did--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
suppose
on
purpose
in
the
sense
that
he
thought
that
it
was
permissible
to
disregard
it
and
did
that,
but
he
did
advise
the
debtor
immediately
after
the
creditors
meeting
about
the
claim
that
he
had.
there
wasn't
any
prejudice
to
the
creditor
here.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
was
whether
section
522
was
a
bar,
and
that's
the
same
issue
in
this
court
as
in
the
lower
courts,
and
we're
suggesting
that
in
interpreting
section
522,
that
the
court
should
look
to
section
105,
which--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that's
correct.
it
was...
well,
the
petition
for
certiorari
noted
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
correct,
we
did
not,
in
the
petition.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
in
the
opening
brief,
that's
correct.
just
to
respond
to
one
point,
the
bankruptcy
court...
and
this
appears
at
page
40(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
bankruptcy
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
court
finds
that
the
value
of
the
cause
of
action
on
october
24,
1984,
and
that's
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition,
was
$110,000...
specific
finding...
and
the
letter
from
the
respondent's
own
lawyer
characterized
it
at
that
time
as
a
claim
for
back
pay
and
interest.
there's
no
exemption
under
the
code
for
back
pay
and
interest
except
to
the
extent
of
the
catch-all
exemption
which
everyone
agrees
in
this
case
would
only
allow
an
exemption
of
$3,950.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
could
ask
for
an
extension
of
time
under
rule
4003,
and
if
the
extension
of
time
is
granted
before
the
expiration
of
the
period
the
court
can
act
on
the
extension
of
time.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
there
is
an
additional
power
in
section
105
and
in
the
prior
equity
practice
which
allows
the
court
to
remedy
a
default
of
this
kind.
i
just
note
for
the
court's
benefit
that
there
is
a
case
that
we
didn't
cite
in
our
brief.
i
call
opposing
counsel's
attention
to
it.
it's
wayne
gas
company,
300
u.s.
131,
which
does
discuss
the
equitable
powers
of
a
bankruptcy
court
to
do
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
it
seems
to
us
that
relying
on
section
105
in
this
context,
which
uses
the
word
construed--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i...
it
wouldn't
surprise
me,
justice
white,
if
the
case
were
ultimately
sent
back
for
a
decision
by
the
bank--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
to
have
him
exercise
his
discretion
under
section
105,
yes.
thank
you.
