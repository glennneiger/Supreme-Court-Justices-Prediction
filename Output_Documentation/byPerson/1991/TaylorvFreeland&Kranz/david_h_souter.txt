justice
souter
mr.
simon,
your
finality
requirement
would
simply
be
satisfied
by
the
finality
of
the
closing
of
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
souter
why
wouldn't
that
be
enough?
justice
souter
well,
doesn't
that...
i
mean,
if
that's
your
criteria,
you're
reading
105
pretty
much
out
of
the
statute,
aren't
you?
justice
souter
no,
but
you're
not
depending
on
orders,
you're
depending
on
process,
and
you
have
conceded
that
process
can
be
an
abuse
of
the
judicial
process,
not
process
referring
to
some
document
issued,
and
the
judicial
process
is
an
on-going
one
which
only
concludes
with
the
closing
of
the
case.
justice
souter
well,
i
thought...
i
guess
we'd
better
get
clear
on
that,
because
i
thought
that
justice
scalia
specifically
asked
you
that
question
to
clarify
that
point,
so
i
think
we
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
abuse
of
process.
justice
souter
well,
if
the
statutory
scheme
is
the
process,
then
i
suppose
the
process
continues
until
the
case
is
closed.
justice
souter
well,
the
inquiry
started
with
your
claim
that
in
administering
105
there
is
an
interest
in
finality
which
must
be
served
in
construing
it
as
to
when
a
105
sua
sponte
objection
may
be
raised,
and
i
said,
isn't
that
interest
served
sufficiently
by
saying
it's
got
to
be
raised
before
the
case
is
closed,
and
since
you
concede
that
process
means
judicial
process,
i.e.
the
whole
statutory
scheme,
it
would
seem
consistent
with
your
view
of
process
to
say
that
a
105
sua
sponte
objection
could
be
raised
by
the
court
or
inquiry
could
be
made
by
the
court
at
any
time
until
the
case
is
closed.
justice
souter
basically
your
defense
here
is
that
this
is
not
an
extreme
case,
isn't
that
right?
i
mean--
justice
souter
mr.
simon,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying,
number
1,
the
amount
of
the
claim
was
low
at
the
relevant
period,
i.e.,
maybe
$9,000
or
$10,000,
and
i
think
you're
also
saying
that
the
value
of
that
claim
as
an
asset
was
not
even
the
amount
of
the
claim
itself,
because
it
was
subject
to
contingencies.
justice
souter
yes,
okay.
