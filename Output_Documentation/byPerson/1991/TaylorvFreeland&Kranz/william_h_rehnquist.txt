chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-571,
robert
j.
taylor,
trustee,
v.
freeland
&
kronz.
mr.
dyk.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
process
that
is
abused
here,
the
filing
by
the
debtor
claiming
the
exemption?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
no,
but
surely...
i
mean,
when
you
say
abuse
of
process,
there's
a
verb
and
a
preposition
and
a
noun,
and
the
noun
is
process,
and
what
is
the
process?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
listing
of
exemptions
is
a
form
of
process,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
first
sentence,
mr.
dyk,
begins
the
court
may
issue
any
order,
process,
or
judgment,
and
that
suggests
that
they're
talking
about
process
in
the
sense
of
something
of
a
writ,
or
something
that
the
court
issues.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea,
mr.
dyk,
what
percentage
of
people
filing
for
bankruptcy
are
represented
by
attorneys
when
they
file
as
opposed
to,
say,
people
who
start
civil
law
suits
in
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
we
really
want
to
import
that
much
of
the
rather
complicated
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
into
bankruptcy
proceedings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
also
saying
we
should
carry
over
at
least
concepts
from
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
we
carry
over
two
or
three
in
this
case
the
next
case
we're
going
to
be
asked
to
carry
over
some
more,
and
pretty
soon
we
won't
know
what
concepts
from
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
apply
in
bankruptcy
and
which
don't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
you
have
a
bankruptcy
rule
that
very
closely
tracks
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
but
it
strikes
me
some
of
your
argument,
or
your
rule
based
on
8(d)
and
55
and
60(b),
you're
just
drawing
analogies
without
any
real
reference
point
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dyk.
mr.
simon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying--
--mr.
simon,
did
your
opponent
rely
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
bankruptcy...
on
section
105(a)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
not
raised
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
simon.
mr.
dyk,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
let
me...
do
you
agree
that
your
clients
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
section
105
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
didn't
suggest
that
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dyk.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-571,
taylor
against
freeland
and
kranz
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
