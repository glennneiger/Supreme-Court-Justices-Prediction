justice
kennedy
under
your
submission,
mr.
dyk,
i
take
it
it
becomes
relevant
whether
there's
a
colorable
basis
for
the
claim,
or
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
claim,
and
my
concern
is
is
that
that
propels
us
into
something
of
a
collateral
inquiry,
and
this
case
illustrates
the
point.
the
issue
isn't
really
presented
in
this
case,
but
it
illustrates
the
point.
isn't
front
pay
exempt?
justice
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
if
she
thought
there
was
a
possibility
of
front
pay
that
that
was
the
basis
for
claiming
the
exemption.
justice
kennedy
but
then
to
that
extent
at
least
it
would
be
exempt,
would
it
not?
justice
kennedy
but
at
a
minimum
does
not
this
illustrate
the
complexity
and
the
difficulty
of
enforcing
the
rule
that
you
propose?
justice
kennedy
i
want
to
be
clear
of
your
position.
you
said
that
if
the
claim
has
no
basis
in
law
or
is
outrageous
or
is
a
perversion
of
the
process,
then
the
105
section
would
apply.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
brings
you
much
closer
to
mr.
dyk's
position
than
i
had
thought
your
brief
indicated,
or
are
you
saying
that--
justice
kennedy
--105
is
not
applicable
in
any
event?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
no
one
contends
the
court
lacks
the
power...
or
do
you
contend
that
the
court
lacks
the
power
to
give
an
extension
of
time
if
the
trustee
requests
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
position
if
the
claim...
the
exemption
has
no
basis
in
law,
which
was
your
phrase?
does
the
failure
to
file
an
objection
within
30
days
prevent
the
trustee
from
later
claiming
that
that
was
an
improper
listing
on
the
exemption
sheet?
justice
kennedy
so
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
there
was
no
basis
in
law.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
kennedy
well,
bright
lines
are
usually
overrestrictive
of
cases
where
fairness
might
call
for
a
different
result,
aren't
they?
justice
kennedy
mr.
dyk,
if
a
trustee
is
puzzled
as
to
whether
the
exemption
is
applied,
is
there
a
formulation
where
he
can
have
some
sort
of
a
running
objection
just
to
leave
the
time
open,
or
is
his
only
option
to
ask
for
a
hearing?
