justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
started
in
1984
when
emily
davis
filed
a
bankruptcy
petition.
at
that
time,
davis
was
pursuing
a
lawsuit
against
her
employer.
on
a
schedule
filed
with
the
bankruptcy
court,
davis
claimed
that
the
proceeds
from
this
lawsuit
would
be
exempt
from
distribution
to
creditors.
she
listed
the
value
of
the
proceeds
as
unknown
because
she
did
not
know
whether
she
would
win
or
lose
the
lawsuit.
the
bankruptcy
trustee
did
not
object.
several
months
later,
while
the
bankruptcy
case
still
was
pending,
davis
won
$110,000
judgment
against
her
employer.
the
trustee
asked
the
bankruptcy
court
to
include
this
money
in
davis'
bankruptcy
estate
so
that
he
could
distribute
it
to
the
creditors.
the
bankruptcy
court
granted
the
trustee's
request,
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
its
decision.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk's
office,
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
davis
claimed
the
proceeds
from
the
lawsuit
as
exempt
property.
the
relevant
bankruptcy
rule
gave
the
trustee
only
30
days
to
object
to
this
claim.
the
trustee
missed
this
deadline.
although
the
trustee
argues
that
davis
had
no
statutory
basis
for
claiming
the
property
as
exempt,
we
have
no
authority
to
create
an
exception
to
the
30-day
period.
the
proceeds,
therefore,
are
exempt
for
distribution
to
creditors.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
