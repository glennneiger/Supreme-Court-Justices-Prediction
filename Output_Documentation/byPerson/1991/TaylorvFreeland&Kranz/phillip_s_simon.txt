mr.
phillip
s.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
are
requesting
that
they
be
allowed
to
retain
their
fees
in
this
case.
they
prosecuted
a
cause
of
action
for
the
debtor
through
three
appellate
courts
in
pennsylvania.
petitioner
has
framed
the
issue
in
terms
of
whether,
under
section
522(1)
of
the
code,
a
bankruptcy
court
may
exempt
property
because
no
one
objected.
the
plain
language
of
section
522(1)
provides
unless
a
party
in
interest
objects,
what's
claimed
as
exempt
is
exempt.
the
language
is
not
ambiguous,
nor
has
petitioner
argued
that
it
is.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
i
don't
believe
that
is...
it
is...
i
don't
believe
that
is
true,
because
the
trustee
commenced
an
action
under
section
549
of
the
code
to
recover
property
transferred.
he
did
not
at
that
point,
as
his
complaint
will
show,
specifically
call
into
question
the
exemption
claimed,
et
cetera.
he
just
simply
claimed
that
it
was
property
of
the
estate.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
it
is,
but--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--we
responded
that
it
was
not
property
of
the
estate
because
it
had
been
prior...
had
been
exempted
out
of
the
estate
under
the
clear
language
of
section
522(1).
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
certainly
the
bankruptcy
rules
flesh
out
the
code
requirement.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
true,
but
formerly
he
has
never,
to
this
day,
objected.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
my
point,
i
guess,
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
his
complaint
that--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--made
him
realize
that
it
had
been
objected...
or,
excuse
me,
claimed
as
exempt.
there's
nothing
in
his
complaint
that
makes
him
aware,
or
makes
us
aware,
excuse
me,
that
he
was
calling
into
question
a
specific
exemption.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
true,
certainly.
the
courts
that
have
not
enforced
the
clear
language
of
section
522(1)
and
rule
4003
have
done
so
largely
on
the
basis
that
it
would
create
a
scheme
of
exemption
by
declaration,
so
to
speak.
this
is
a
policy
argument,
and
we
don't
believe
you
reach
policy
arguments
in
a
case
where
the
language
is
so
clear,
the
legislative
history
is
so
clear--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--i'm
reading
the
word
may,
i
believe,
to
say
a
creditor
may
object,
he
does
not
have
to
object,
but
the
time
limit
set
out
later
in
the
rule...
may
object
within
30
days
of
a
meeting
of
creditors
held
pursuant
to
a
certain
rule
unless
further
time
is
granted
by
the
court
within
such
period,
and
further
bankruptcy
rule--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--as
it
regards
the
time
limit,
certainly.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
i
believe
it
can,
frankly.
the
second
sentence
of
105
states
that
there
is
no
provision
of
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
prevent
the
court
from
sua
sponte
taking
action
necessary
or
appropriate
to
enforce
orders,
rules,
and
abuse
of
process.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
well,
certainly
if
there
was
no
objective
basis
in
fact,
or
no
arguable
basis
in
law,
it
was
clearly
an
outrageous
matter.
if
it
was
a
perversion
of
the
process,
yes,
it
could
be
read
that
way,
and
properly
read
that
way.
however,
we
don't
believe
that
factually
exists
in
this
case.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
well,
again,
to
some
extent
pardons
must
be
bound
by
what
they
raise
or
don't
raise,
and
this
particular
provision
speaks
in
terms
of
court
orders,
rules,
and
abuse
of
process.
certainly
the
rules
are
very
strict
in
this
arena,
as
they
are
in...
throughout
the
federal
rules
of
bankruptcy
procedure.
they
generally
provide
for
short
time
limits
to
expedite
and
move
cases,
and
clearly--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--no,
there
certainly
is
not,
your
honor.
it
is
a
general...
it
is
in
a
provision
of
the
code
that
speaks
to
the
general
equity
powers
of
the
court.
however,
here
you
have
a
specific,
if
you
want
to
term
it
legal
statutory
scheme,
partly
set
out
in
the
code,
of
course,
and
partly
set
out
in
the
rules.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
well--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--pardon
me.
i
believe
it
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
specific
rules
in
statutory
scheme.
for
example,
if
on
the
30th
day
of
the
running
of
the
objection
period
the
court
had
allowed
extension
because...
on
its
own
motion
or
ruling
had
allowed
extension
and
directed
the
trustee
to
review
the
claim
of
exemption,
that
would
be
perfectly
proper,
perfectly
within
the
equity
powers
of
the
court.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
no.
certainly
under
rule
4003,
if
it's
requested
within
the
period
and
granted
within
the
period--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--yes,
certainly
there
must
be
a
bright
line.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
eventually
it
must
not.
eventually
there
must
be
a
bright
line.
i'm
trying
not
to
be
overrestrictive
of
the
reading
of
the
equitable--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--certainly.
i
guess
i'm
suggesting
that
105
must
be
read
in
relation
or
construed
with
the
code
section
and
the
rule
sections,
and
they
are
so
strict
and
so
clear,
as
you
will...
if
you
will,
that
the
equitable
provisions
must
again
be--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--construed
strictly.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
certainly.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
in
this
case,
however,
the
only
action
taken
by
the
court
was
approximately
3-1/2
years
after
the
objection
to
exemption
period
had
run.
that
is,
if
you
will,
a
40-times
extension
of
the
objection
to
exemption
period.
at
some
point,
there
must
be
finality
in
these
matters.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
my
client,
freeland
&
kronz,
knew
that
by
letter
directed
to
them,
and
that
was
an
inquiry
letter
which
they
answered.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
well,
indeed
it...
whether
it
should
or
should
not
have
been
a
surprise,
it
was.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
to
some
extent.
he
claimed
in
the
letter
that
the
net
proceeds
of
the
cause
of
action
were
property
of
the
estate.
that
was
before
the
exemption
to
objection
period
had
run.
there
was
really
no
way
to
knowing
whether
he,
after
further
inquiry,
thought
it
was
unlikely
there
would
be
a
recovery
and
did
not
choose
to
exempt,
or
object
to
the
exemption,
or
he
just
failed
to
take
action
for
some
other
cause.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
it
could
be,
certainly.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
well,
simply
stated,
i
guess,
because
there's
specific
code
and
rule
language
that
calls
for
an
earlier
deadline,
and--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--i
am
reading
105
to
be
severely
limited,
because
it
contains
the
language
necessary
or
appropriate
to
enforce
orders,
rules,
or
prevent
abuse
of
process.
there
were
no
prior
orders
here,
and--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--well,
if
i
stated
that
or
implied
that,
it's
broader
than
i
intended.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
when
i
say
process,
the
code
and
the
rules,
the
statutory
scheme
is
the
process,
or
is--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--but
i...
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
inquiry
of
the
court,
but--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--well,
certainly
the
case
closing
could
be
a
deadline,
but
i
guess
i'm
saying
that
there
is
a
specific
deadline
in
this
statutory
scheme,
and
there
is
no
real
reason
for
going
outside
of
that
scheme
except
in
very
extreme
and
unusual
cases
where
there
are...
where...
and
you
don't
have
that
concern
not
only
specifically
in
this
case
but
the
court
did
not
really
take
any
sua
sponte
action
except
years
into
the
future
in
this
case
after
the
exemption
period
had
run.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
certainly.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
absolutely,
because
under
the
exemption
scheme
the
debtor
had
three
arguable
bases
for
exemptions
under
522(d)(5),
the
so-called
wild
card
exemption
allows
$4,150
in
any
property.
also,
future
earnings,
and
arguably,
though
perhaps
weak,
a
claim
for
loss
of
pension.
it's
unquestionable
that
her
attorneys
claimed
loss
of
pension
rights,
whether
ultimately
there
was
an
entitlement.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
we
don't
believe
that
that
was,
indeed,
on
the
appropriate
date,
the
date
of
the
petition
filing,
that
that
lawsuit
was
worth
$110,000.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
there
was
a
letter--
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
--no.
no,
certainly
there
was
a
letter
from
an
associate
in
the
firm
of
freeland
&
kronz
that
responded
to
the
trustee's
inquiry,
and
that
letter
certainly
did
state
that
there
was
no
way
of
ascertaining
the
value
of
the
claim
to
ms.
davis
other
than
calculating
back
pay
and
interest,
and
he
had
calculated
that
at
$110,000.
that
occurred
after
the
petition
date,
and
it
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
final
liability
which
turned
out...
at
that
time,
which
turned
out
to
be
incorrect,
at
least
at
that
time.
but
more
importantly,
at
that
time
there
had
not
been
damages
testimony.
the
pittsburgh
human
relations
commission
had
entered
an
order
that
said
you're
entitled
to
wage
loss
for
a
period
from
1976
until
the
time
that
the
defendant
no
longer
employed
a
certain
category
of
employee
in
pittsburgh,
and
if
you
make
that
calculation,
as
we
have
done
in
our
brief,
that
amounts
to
roughly
$9,000
or
$10,000
in
damages,
so
at
that
point
in
time,
the
burden
was
on
the
debtor
through
her
attorneys
to
in
effect
reverse
that
commission
order.
now,
they
later
went
forward
towards
a
trial
on
damages
and
the
matter
was,
of
course,
eventually
settled,
but
at
that
point
in
time,
at
the
critical
point
in
time,
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition,
liability
was
not
finally
determined.
yes,
the
case
has
a
see-saw
history
and
the
last
court
that
had
ruled
was
in
the
debtor's
favor,
but
more
importantly
the
claim
that
it
was
worth
$110,000
in
my
client's
word
was...
at
that
time
was
a
flight
of
fancy.
there
was
a
specific
commission
order
in
place,
and
those
damages
were
severely
limited,
and
the
testimony
at
trial
was
similar,
that
the
only
evidence
presented
was
the
claim
was
not
as
valuable
at
that
time.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
no,
your
honor.
that
was
not
raised.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
no.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
phillip
s.
simon
if
there
are
no
further
inquiries
from
the
court,
i
would
ask
to
be
excused.
