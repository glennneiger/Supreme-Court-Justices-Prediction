justice
stevens
but
mr.
simon,
is
it
not
true
that
the
real
objection
is
that
he
didn't
make
a
timely
objection?
he
did
make
known
his
objection.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
would
not
be
a
complete
answer
if
there
were
no
timeliness
requirement.
he
could
say
well,
i'll
make
my
objection
now.
your
basic
argument
is
the
objection
was
made
too
late.
justice
stevens
so
the
real
question
is
not
on
what
522(1)
requires
or
means,
but
rather
what
the
bankruptcy
rule
requires.
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
didn't
have
the
bankruptcy
rule
you'd
have
no
case,
because
he
could
say
i'm
now
making
my
objection.
justice
stevens
well,
he
might
do
it
today.
he'd
still
be
okay,
if
it
weren't
for
the
bankruptcy
rule--
justice
stevens
--because
the
estate's
still
opened,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
make
one
other
observation?
on
the
rule,
you're
reading
the
word
may
as
thought
it
said
must,
aren't
you?
justice
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
it
really
means
must,
and
that's
a
fair
reading.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
isn't,
but
you
really
are
reading
the
word
may
as
though
it
said
must.
