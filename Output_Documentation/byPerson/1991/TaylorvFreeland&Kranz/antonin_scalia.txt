what
if
it
had
been
closed,
mr.
dyk?
what
if
the
whole
bankruptcy
proceeding
had
been
closed?
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
anyway,
wouldn't
you?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
that
this
provision...
does
this
provision
say
as
long
as
105(a)...
does
that
apply
only
when
the
proceeding
is
still
open?
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
well,
i...
it
makes
a
big
difference
to
me
how
i
view
this
case
if
i
think,
well,
it's
only
going
to
apply
where
you
have
a
trustee
who
didn't
make
a
technical
objection
but
he
did
write
to
the
lawyers
and
he
did
know
there
was
a
problem
there
and
kept
the
case
open
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
105(a),
and
if
he
hadn't
done
that,
bygones
is
bygones,
once
there's
the
discharge
and
the
case
is
closed
it's
all
over
with,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
would
happen.
you
say
the
case
could
be
reopened
whenever
somebody
combs
through
the
whole
thing
and
finds
out
there
was
a
mistake.
justice
scalia
arguably,
you
would
also
have
to
make
a
showing
of
cause
for
the
trustee's
not
making
the
objection
soon,
if
it
was
apparent
on
its
face--
justice
scalia
--which
you
don't
think
is
necessary
in
order
to
recover
here,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
but
again,
why
don't
we
impose
a
cause
requirement
there
and
not
just
a
cause
requirement
in
order
to
reopen?
that
is
to
say,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
there
be
no
legal
basis
for
the
claimed
exception,
why
don't
we
impose
also
a
requirement
that
there
be
some
plausible
reason
why
the
trustee
did
not
object
as
he
should
have?
justice
scalia
even
when
no
reopening
is
necessary.
justice
scalia
what's
the
good
reason
here?
justice
scalia
but--
justice
scalia
--but
time
limits
are
always
strict.
i
mean,
a
time
limit
is
a
time
limit,
and
you
know,
105
applies...
105(a)
applies
to
provisions
providing
for
the
raising
of
an
issue
by
a
party.
you
acknowledge,
however,
that
abuse
of
process
is
not
process
in
the
common
law
sense,
that
abuse
of
process
means
abuse
of
the...
embraces
abuse
of
the
judicial
process.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
--why
isn't
it
an
extreme
case?
do
you
say
that
there
was
a
valid
legal
basis
for
exemption
of
the
entire
claim?
justice
scalia
well,
would
that
have
covered
the
entire
claim?
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
a
claim
that
was
worth
$110,000.
you
know,
the
$6,000
isn't
going
to
cover
much
of
that.
justice
scalia
well,
the
claim...
that's
what
had...
i
thought
that
the
letter
from
your
firm
to
the
trustee
said
that,
that
that
had
been
what
the
award
had
been.
justice
scalia
did
i
make
this
up?
i
don't
think
i
made
it
up.
