justice
o'connor
mr.
dyk,
do
you
claim
that
all
of
the
recovery
is
open
for
the
trustee
to
seek
recovery?
i
thought
you
thought
only
a
portion
of
it
was
recoverable.
justice
o'connor
but
i
guess
as
the
case
comes
to
us
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that.
we
deal
only
with
a
portion
of
it.
justice
o'connor
did
you
argue
the
application
of
the
new
sentence
in
section
105
in
the
court
below?
justice
o'connor
so
it's
being
urged
for
the
first
time
here.
justice
o'connor
if
it
were
to
apply,
how
do
you
think
abuse
of
process
should
be
defined?
justice
o'connor
you
think
that
the
claiming
of
an
exemption
which
the
statute
doesn't
allow
is
an
abuse
of
process?
justice
o'connor
yes.
mr.
simon,
what
do
you
suppose
the
meaning
of
section
105
is,
and
could
the
second
sentence,
the
new
sentence
added
to
section
105,
ever
be
relied
upon
in
one
of
these
bankruptcy
cases
to
overcome
the
failure
to
make
a
timely
objection
to
an
acclaimed
exemption?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
think
abuse
of
process
means
as
applied
to
an
exemption
claim?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
court
below
had
no...
apparently
made
no
reliance
upon,
did
not
consider,
the
possible
application
of
section
105.
justice
o'connor
so
is
it
still
open
in
the
court
below
to
consider
that
possibility?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
there
any
express
time
limit
for
use
of
section
105,
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
