justice
white
is
that
in
the
code?
justice
white
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
white
how
many...
what
percentage
of
all
of
the
filings
involve
a
trustee?
justice
white
which
is
this
one.
justice
white
so
it
isn't
the
bankruptcy
judges
that
are
any
more...
they
are
more
inundated
than
the
trustees.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--the
trustee
is
the
person
who
failed
to
object
here,
or
any
creditors
failed
to
object--
justice
white
--isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
you
seem
to
have
it
now.
the
creditors
seem
to
have
an
interest
now.
justice
white
well,
the
trustee
certainly
didn't
do
what
he
should
have
done.
justice
white
where
did
you
file...
where
did
the
trustee
file
the
suit?
justice
white
was
it...
a
bankruptcy
judge
ruled
on
it?
justice
white
like
bad
faith?
justice
white
like
bad
faith?
wouldn't
that
be
a
significant
showing?
justice
white
well,
after
all
the
rule
just
says
a
trustee
or
creditor
may
file
within
30
days.
do
you
concede
that
that
means
that
after
30
days
under
the
rule
they're
just
foreclosed,
unless
you
can
rely
on
105?
justice
white
so
the
negligence
of
the
trustee
should
really
never
be
a
bar
where
there's
an
abuse
of
process.
justice
white
well,
the
trustee...
do
you
think
the
trustee
should
have
filed
a
claim...
i
mean,
should
have
filed
an
objection?
justice
white
why
didn't
he?
justice
white
well,
he
did
disregard
the
rule.
justice
white
not
just
negligently,
on
purpose.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
that's
a
pretty
good
challenge
to
the
claim
of
exemption.
justice
white
well,
it
can't
be
both
exempt
and
property
of
the
estate.
justice
white
well,
he
filed
his
suit,
though,
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
right
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
justice
white
well,
that's
a...
and
if
he
was
trying
to
recover
property
he
certainly
was
objecting
to
the
claim
of
exemption.
justice
white
said
objection.
justice
white
well,
but
you
responded
by
saying
that
the
property
was
exempt.
justice
white
did
you
know...
i
take
it
the
trustee
did
notify
some
people
that...
about
his
position
with
respect
to
the
estate's
interest
in
the
possible
recovery.
justice
white
did
the
debtor
know
that?
justice
white
so
it
was
no
surprise
that
the
trustee
made
a
claim
3-1/2
years
later.
justice
white
although
it
was
wholly
consistent
with
his
letter
3-1/2
years
before.
justice
white
nor
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
didn't
even
cite--
justice
white
--and
the
first
time
it
appeared
here
was
in
the
briefs.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
question
you
did
raise
in
your
petition
subsumes
this
position--
justice
white
--this
is
just
another
argument
for
saying
522
didn't
bar.
justice
white
but
i
suppose
you...
even
if
we
get
to
105,
i
would
suppose
that
it
wouldn't
surprise
you
if
we
said
we're
not
going
to
fool
with
105.
i
mean,
we're
not
going
to
decide
the
case
based
on
that,
we're
going
to
send
it
back.
justice
white
to
see
what
effect
105
had.
