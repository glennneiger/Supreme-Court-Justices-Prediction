how
do
you
answer
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
sherman
act
and
its
reasonableness
standard,
mr.
roberts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dsida,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
theory,
that
the
court
would
be
asked
in
each
instance
to
look
at
the
specifics
of
the
plan
and
then
determine
whether
in
that
state
the
plan
was
specific
enough
to
give
some
cause
of
action
for
enforcement,
and
that
would
become
the
standard,
which
would
seem
perhaps
to
result
in
different
standards
being
applied
in
different
states
depending
on
the
content
of
a
particular
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
rely
on
any
other
specifics
in
this
particular
state
of
illinois
as
supporting
your
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
courts
below
did
in
fact
look
further
and
look
at
what
illinois
had
done
and
said
and
because
the
state
had
indicated
that
the
provision
of
child
care
workers
was
the
linchpin
and
so
forth,
that
that
provided
the
standard.
the
court
didn't
need
to
do
that,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
if
another
state
hadn't
made
the
provision
of
child
caseworkers
a
linchpin
then
no
remedy
could
be
devised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
federal
statutory
scheme
envision
that
the
federal
government
will
fund
100
percent
of
the
costs
or
does
it
assume
that
it's
going
to
be
a
shared
cost,
state
and
federal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
shared,
it
is
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
real
question
is
whether
a
deficiency
in
that
regard,
if
it
exists,
is
one
that
is
to
be
remedied
by
the
secretary's
withholding
of
funds
or
by
some
individual
suit
under
section
1983
or
otherwise.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
we
have
also
said
that
in
order
to
provide
a
private
cause
of
action
under
1983,
we
have
to
find
certain
things,
certain
objective
standards,
and
one
thing
and
another.
isn't
that
the
question
before
us?
