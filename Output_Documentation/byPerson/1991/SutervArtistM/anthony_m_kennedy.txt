justice
anthony

--what
are
the
reasonableness
requirements
that
the
court
must
determine
under
672
in
the
event
of
payment
to
a
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
statute
does
require
the
courts
in
this
instance
to
make
a
determination
whether
or
not
reasonable
efforts
have
been
made.
is
that
a
different
inquiry
than
the
respondents
are
asking
for
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
reasonableness
of
the
plan
is
not
in
question
in
the
inquiry
that
is
made
under
672(a)(1)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
have
one
question.
assume
that
there
is
clear
noncompliance
with
the
reasonable
plan
requirement,
could
respondents
bring
an
action
against
the
secretary
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
compel
the
secretary
to
withhold
payments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
inquiry
there
would
be
the
same
if
such
an
action
were
brought?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
prosecutorial
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
plan
is
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
the
base
point,
the
beginning
point
is
that
we
assume
that
there
is
in
place
a
plan
that
if
followed
would
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
reason
that
heckler
v.
chaney
would
apply
in
your
view
is
that
there
is
no
meaningful
standard
to
judge
the
secretary's
actions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
reason
there
was
no
action
permitted
there
was
there
was
no
meaningful
standard
by
which
to
measure
the
secretary's
actions.
