well,
i
suppose
the
state
in
submitting
a
plan
promises
to
live
up
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
says
that
is
a
good
way,
that's
fine.
that
is
just
fine,
and
so
why
would
a
court
have
to
decide
what
a
benchmark
is,
they
just
want
to
enforce
this
promise
that
the
state
has...
here
is
what
we
are
going
to
do
and
the
secretary
says
fine,
go
ahead
and
do
it.
and
why
can't
a
private
person
just
enforce
that
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it
mean
that
in
each
case
these
services
will
be
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
doesn't
provide
any
services
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
claim
the
secretary
made
a
mistake
in
approving
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
plan
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
say
you
want
to
enforce
the
plan,
it
looks
to
me
like
you
would
let
us
know
what
the
plan
you
are
trying
to
enforce
is.
