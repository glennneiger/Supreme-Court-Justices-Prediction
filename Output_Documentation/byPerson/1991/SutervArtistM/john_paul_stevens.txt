justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
on
that
point,
is
it
so
vague
that
the
secretary
could
never
enforce
this
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
it...
you
have
a
plan
approved
such
as
this
one
and
then
assume
the
state
or
whatever
the
agency
is,
did
absolutely
nothing
to
implement
it,
could
the
funds
be
withdrawn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
be
following
a...
enforcing
a
federal
right
if
he
did
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
you
use
the
same
test
to
ask
whether
a
federal
right
has
been
violated,
but
where
nothing
at
all
is
being
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
what
justice
scalia's
question
was
directed
to,
is
that
reasonableness
is
a
standard
that
is
judicially
enforceable
in
other
contexts,
but
you
say
not
in
this
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
case
will
decide
that
case
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute,
but
the
statute
does
require
the
plan
to
include
a
systemic
right,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
in
each
case
language
is
in...
i
thought
it
was
in
(a)(2)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
very
fact
that
the
requirement
is
in
a
plan
means
it
has
to
be
part
of
the
system,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
are
saying
is
the
plan
required
by
the
secretary
contemplates
variation
for
different
kinds
of
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
that
regulation
is
in
the
materials
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
mr.
roberts,
that
the
secretary
could
never
withhold
funds
for
failure
to
comply
with
this
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
entrusted
pursuant
to
any
standard
specified
by
congress
or
are
they
entirely
made
up
by
the
secretary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
secretary
know
what's
reasonable,
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
those
policy
judgments
guided
by
anything
congress
says
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
it
confine
the
secretary's
discretion
anymore
than
it
would
confine
the
judge's
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
any
legislative
guidance
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
just
interrupt?
is
it
clear
that
the
budget
is
of
state
money
or
maybe
this
is
a
budget
of
the
federal
program?
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
how
much
of
the
money
that
is
needed
to
buy,
to
pay
for
additional
caseworkers
would
come
from
the
federal
subsidy
and
how
much
would
come
from
the
state
tax
revenues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
presumably,
the
purpose
of
the
funding
was
to
enable
the
state
to
comply
with
this
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
how
do
we
assume
there
is
a
need
for
the
state
to
spend
a
single
dollar
of
its
own
money?
we
just
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question?
is
the
question
whether,
quote,
reasonable
efforts,
unquote,
have
been
made
a
question
of
federal
law
or
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
sometimes
you
can
give
a
short
answer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
think
you
it's
a
question
of...
the
meaning
of
these
words
in
this
federal
statute
is
a
question
of
state
law?
