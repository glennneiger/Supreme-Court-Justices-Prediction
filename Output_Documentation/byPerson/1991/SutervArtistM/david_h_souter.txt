justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
anything
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
judgment
which
makes
the
secretary
more
competent,
or
perhaps
i
should
say
a
more
appropriate
person
to
make
the
judgment
about
reasonableness
than
a
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
am
sorry,
i
thought
you
have
finished.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
have
been
within
the
statute
for
the
federal
administrator,
for
the
secretary
to
refuse
to
approve
a
plan
unless
it
was
more
specific
than
the
one
involved
here?
you
say
that
the
plan
here
essentially
just
repeats
that
best
efforts
will
be
made.
would
it
have
been
appropriate
for
the
secretary
to
say,
i
won't
approve
a
plan
unless
it
provides
for
social
workers
to
be
assigned
within
3
days?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
he
had,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
wouldn't
have
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
something
peculiar
about
the
reasonableness
judgment
here
in
implicating
essentially
judgments
about
the
appropriate
determination
of
the
way
the
state
uses
its
money?
in
other
words,
one
of
the
benchmark
problems
in
this
case
is
that
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
benchmark
anywhere
like
the
well-run
clinic
in
wilder,
the
free
market,
whatever,
of
whatever
value
that
is.
here,
the
reference
has
to
be
an
appropriate
expenditure
of
state
revenues
and
a
appropriate
determination
about
the
amount
of
revenues
to
be
used,
or
do
those
two
elements
of
the
decision
make
this
something
quite
different
from
the
normal
reasonableness
determination
that
federal
courts
make
every
day?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
state
simply
replies,
as
it
seems
to
me
it
is
bound
to
do
in
a
certain
number
of
cases,
no,
we
are
not
going
to
have
a
caseworker
for
every
complaint
in
3
days
because
we
haven't
got
enough
money
to
pay
caseworkers,
and
we
haven't
got
enough
money
to
do
that
because
we
have
to
build
highways
and
we
don't
want
to
raise
the
tax
rate
and
so
on.
ultimately,
i
suppose
any
state
could
have
a
caseworker
in
3
days
if
it
wants
to
spend
money
enough.
why
isn't
that
necessarily
implicated?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
has
accepted
an
obligation
to
do
something
which
is
reasonable,
but
what
is
reasonable
is
in
part
a
decision
about
the
appropriate
expenditure
of
state
funds
in
relation
to
the
problem,
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
more
specific
federal
standard
to
which
a
federal
court
can
look
in
determining
whether
that
particular
aspect
of
reasonableness
has
been
satisfied.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
asking
for
more
than
simply
a
determination
that
nothing
is
not
reasonable.
you
are
asking
for
a
determination,
in
effect,
of
what
is
reasonable,
assignment
in
3
days,
whatever.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
remedy
being,
in
effect,
a
plan
for
the
assignment
of
caseworkers--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
standards
determining
when
they
should
get
assigned.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
weren't
asking
them
to
order
caseworkers
when
in
fact
caseworkers
had
not
otherwise
been
thought
appropriate.
what
you
are
asking
them
to
do
is
to
determine
when
and
how
caseworkers
should
be
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
just
to
provide
caseworkers
to
provide
caseworkers
subject
to
certain
standards
of
assignment,
subject
to
a
standard
governing
the
number
of
days
within
which
workers
must
be
assigned,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
fair
enough.
and
if
they
can't
and
you
in
effect
are
claiming
or
the
federal
court
is
claiming
that
there
ought
to
be
a
caseworker
assigned
within
3
days
and
the
state
says
no,
we
can't
do
it
because
we
haven't
got
enough
money
to
pay
for
caseworkers,
then
to
go
back
to
my
original
question,
ultimately
you
are
asking
for
a
determination
about
the
appropriate
expenditure
of
state
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
look,
let's
assume...
maybe
i
was
leaving
a
term
out,
let's
assume
that
in
fact
the
state
is
correct,
that
it
simply
does
not
have
a
budget
which
would
allow
for
the
hiring
of
enough
caseworkers
to
satisfy,
we
will
say,
the
3-day
standard.
the
question
is,
should
money
be
appropriated
in
a
different
fashion,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
answer
my
question
first
and
that
is--
--mr.
dsida,
when
a
member
of
the
court
asks
you
a
question
that
can
be
answered
by
a
yes
or
no,
you
should--
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be.
i
am
in
no
position
to
suggest
otherwise
there,
but
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question.
are
we
unable
to
tell
from
this
record
even
whether
the
funds
for
social
workers
or
the
funds
for
the
administration
of
the
program
in
general
consists
of
a
mix
of
state
and
federal
dollars?
do
we
not
even
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
reallocation
involve
state
money
as
distinguished
from
federal
money?
