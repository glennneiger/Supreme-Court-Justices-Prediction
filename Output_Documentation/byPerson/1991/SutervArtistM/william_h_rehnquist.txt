we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-1488,
sue
suter
v.
artist
m..
ms.
tchen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
speaks
of
a
plan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
a
system
and
a
plan
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
what
has
to
provide
that
reasonable
efforts
will
be
made?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
the
plan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
agree
that
the
plan
provides
for
reasonable
efforts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
never
raised--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
blue
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
tchen,
will
you
file
with
the
clerk,
as
soon
as
you
can
after
the
argument,
a
full
copy
of
the
section
you
were
just
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
find
it's
not
otherwise
in
the
briefs
or
in
the
appendix.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
tchen.
mr.
roberts,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
could
you
answer
justice
kennedy's...
just
the
question
he
just
put
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well
mr.
roberts.
mr.
dsida,
we'll
now
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner,
mr.
dsida,
that
your
clients
have
not
attacked
the
plan
filed
by
the
state
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
the
defendants
have
to
make
reasonable
efforts?
the
statute
says,
the
plan
shall
provide
that
reasonable
efforts
shall
be
made,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
your
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
you?
you
don't
agree
with
petitioners,
that
you
did
not
attack
the
plan,
and
therefore
you
say
you
did
attack
the
plan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
two
different
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
two
different
things?
one,
whether
the
plan
complies
with
the
statute,
and
second,
whether
the
defendants
have
lived
up
to
their
obligation
under
the
plan.
is
that
or
is
that
not
two
different
things?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
what
the
statutory
language
that...
at
least
the
petitioners
were
talking
about
related
to,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
see
to
it
that
the
clerk
has
copies?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--answer
yes
or
no
and
then
give
your
reasons
for
answering
the
way
you
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dsida.
ms.
tchen,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
tchen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
three
cases.
the
first
is
no.
90-1488,
suter
versus
artist
m.
in
1980,
congress
acting
pursuant
to
the
spending
power
conferred
on
it
by
article
i
of
the
constitution
passed
the
adoption
assistance
in
child
welfare
act.
this
law
says
that
the
federal
government
will
reimburse
states
for
certain
expenses
which
they
incur
in
setting
up
foster
care
and
adoption
assistance
programs.
to
participate
in
the
program,
a
state
must
submit
a
plan
for
approval
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
one
section
of
the
act
lists
16
features
that
a
plan
must
contain
in
order
to
be
approved.
one
of
these
is
that
reasonable
efforts
will
be
made
to
prevent
removal
of
children
from
their
homes
and
to
encourage
reunification
of
families
where
removal
has
occurred.
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
are
class
of
children
in
cook
county,
illinois
who
have
been
removed
from
their
homes
because
of
evidence
that
they
have
been
abused
or
neglected.
they
sued
the
illinois
state
administrator
claiming
that
because
the
illinois
agency
delayed
in
providing
case
workers
to
children,
it
had
failed
to
make
the
reasonable
efforts
required
by
the
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
for
them
and
upheld
an
order
that
the
agency
must
assign
a
case
worker
within
three
days
of
the
time
when
each
child
is
first
removed
from
his
home.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
adoption
act
is
not
privately
enforceable
under
section
1983.
when
congress
wishes
to
impose
conditions
on
the
receipt
of
funds
pursuant
to
the
spending
power
statute,
it
must
impose
these
conditions
unambiguously.
for
reasons
more
fully
amplified
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
provision
requiring
reasonable
efforts
in
this
act
was
intended
to
give
the
states
discretion
and
is
too
general
to
admit
a
judicial
enforcement
by
private
suit.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
stevens
joins.
