ms.
christina
m.
tchen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
adoption
assistance
act
and
child
welfare
act
of
1980,
specifically
the
provision
commonly
referred
to
as
the
reasonable
efforts
clause,
creates
rights
that
may
be
enforceable
under
42
usc
section
1983.
the
reasonable
efforts
clause
states
that
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
federal
foster
care
reimbursement
funds,
that
states
must
have
a
plan
approved
by
the
secretary
that
provides
that
in
each
case
reasonable
efforts
will
be
made
to
keep
or
return
a
child
home.
the
reasonable
efforts
clause
does
not
provide
any
further
definition
or
explanation
of
reasonable
efforts.
in
light
of
that,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
misapplied
this
court's
decision
in
wilder
v.
virginia
hospital
association
when
it
held
that
this
clause
was
sufficiently
specific
and
definite
to
create
an
enforceable
right.
the
state
of
illinois
maintains
that
although
the
adoption
assistance
act
is
mandatory
and
benefits
the
plaintiffs
here,
that
it
is
simply
too
vague
and
amorphous
to
create
a
federal
right.
this
court
has
stated
that
in
order
to
create
federal
rights
upon
the
states,
congress
must
speak
with
a
clear
voice
because
of
the
values
and
concerns
inherent
in
our
system
of
government,
and
that
clear
voice
and
clear
statement
is
simply
lacking
here.
one
of
the
elements
of
determining
whether
a
clear
statement
has
been
provided
by
congress
under
section
1983
is
whether
the
interest
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
is
too
vague
and
amorphous
such
that
it
is
beyond
the
competence
of
the
judiciary
to
enforce.
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
here
was
to
take
this
notion
of
competence
of
the
judiciary
in
the
abstract.
it
never
looked
at
the
statute
at
issue
here
and
simply
said,
that
because
courts
have
proved
competent
to
enforce
a
reasonableness
terms
in
other
statutes
that
have
no
relation
to
the
statute
at
hand
here,
that
therefore,
courts
are
competent
to
enforce
this
particular
reasonable
efforts
clause.
but
this
reasonable
efforts
clause
stands
in
stark
contrast,
for
example,
to
the
clause
construed
by
this
court
in
wilder
v.
virginia
hospital
association.
in
wilder
this
court
held
that
the
boren
amendment
to
the
medicaid
act
created
a
federal
right
to
reasonable
and
adequate
medicaid
reimbursement
rates,
but
it
did
so
after
a
lengthy
and
extensive
analysis
of
the
statute
at
hand.
and
what
this
court
found
was
that
the
boren
amendment
there
set
forth
a
lengthy
list
of
specific
factors,
specific
objective
benchmarks
defining
what
meant
reasonable.
there
are
no
such
benchmarks
or
factors
here,
and
what
we
are
left
with
is
a
reasonable
efforts
clause
with
no
definition
supplied
by
congress
that
will
subject
the
states
to
a
substantive
right
to
reasonable
efforts
that
will
be
defined
not
by
congress
but
by
individual
judges
applying
their
own
notions
of
reasonableness.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
but
what
is
missing
here,
justice
scalia,
is
a
specific
designation
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
federal
right.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
we
must...
there
is
no
specific
designation
of
a
federal
right
or
federal
intent
to
create
a
national
standard
of
child
welfare
or
to
federalize
child
welfare.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
what
this
court
has
said
in
wilder
is
to
set
out
a
three-part
test
for
when
under
section
1983
this
court
can
infer
a
congressional
intent
to
create
a
federal
right,
and
the
third
element
of
that
test
is
whether
the
interest
is
too
vague
and
amorphous.
here
we
have
a
statute
that
we
agree
is
mandatory,
benefits
plaintiffs,
but
it
is
simply
too
vague,
and
what
this
court
has
said
in
wilder
is
that
there
cannot
be
a
federal
right
unless
there
is
a
specific
objective
benchmark
provided
by
congress
that
measures
what
is
reasonable,
and
that's
what
is
lacking
here.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
reasonable
efforts
that
we
are
talking
about
here--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--no,
what
the
secretary
does
and
the
congress
has
specifically
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
authority
to
approve
a
plan,
to
make
sure
that
it
provides
reasonable
efforts
or
to
withdraw
funds
if
not.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
the
funds...
the
secretary
would
have
the
discretion
to
withdraw
the
funds.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
no.
i
think
it
would
be
enforcing
a
federal
statute.
again,
section
1983
does
not
exist
simply
to
remedy
statutory
violations.
section
1983
exists
to
remedy
deprivation
of
federal
rights,
and
what
we
have
to
find
here
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
right
that
exists,
not
merely
a
mandatory
federal
statute
that
may
be
violated.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note,
we
can
always
state
the
most
egregious
case
where
a
statute
we
would
all
agree
has
been
clearly
violated,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
federal
right
that
is
created.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
what
we
need,
justice
stevens,
is
a
benchmark
that
governs
not
only
the
easy
case
that
you
have
posed,
which
is
where
there
is
simply
no
efforts
at
all
that
are
being
exerted
by
the
state,
but
also
the
harder
case,
which
i
submit
is
this
case.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
i
say
not
in
this
case
because
for
example,
in
this
case,
this
is
not
the
case
where
the
state
was
making
no
reasonable
efforts
at
all,
never
assigning--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--i
think
that
is
true,
and
i
think
the
problems
in
this
case
demonstrate
the
problems
with
having
a
reasonable
efforts
clause
that
is
not
defined
by
congress.
in
this
case,
what
the
district
court
below
found
was
that
after
the
state
of
illinois
instituted
a
remedial
plan
to
assign
caseworkers
more
quickly,
83
percent
of
the
time
the
district
court
found
the
state
of
illinois
was
assigning
a
caseworker
within
10
calendar
days,
less
than
2
weeks.
nonetheless,
and
we
don't
know
why,
the
district
court
found
that
to
be
unreasonable.
the
state
further
provided
specific
evidence
on
why
there
may
be
instances
in
which
a
delay
in
assigning
a
caseworker
would
be
reasonable.
for
example,
the
state
of
illinois
is
under
another
consent
to
create
another
federal
case
that
requires
the
state
to
provide
a
spanish-speaking
caseworker
only
to
spanish-speaking
families
and
children.
but
a
spanish-speaking
caseworker
may
not
be
available
within
the
3
days
that
the
injunction
requires
or
even
the
10
days
in
which
83
percent
of
the
cases
were
assigned.
there
are
other
instances.
we
had
testimony
in
the
preliminary
injunction
action
that
a
3-day
across
the
board
rule
such
as
was
imposed
by
the
district
court
here
requires
us
to
assign
a
caseworker
to
a
case
with
less
risk,
the
truant
teenager
case,
as
quickly
as
we
assign
a
case
to
the
severely
burned
infant.
it
is
simply...
it's
an
intrusion
by
the
federal
court
on
that
very
specific
decision
making
that
child
welfare
administrators
are
supposed
to
make
and
what
congress
intended
child
welfare
administrators
to
make.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
i
think
so,
justice
souter.
this
is
particularly
an
area
where
we
don't
know
what
works
with
abused
and
neglected
children,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed
in
1980,
this
whole
concept
of
requiring
states
to
make
reasonable
efforts
to
keep
abused
children
in
abusive
homes
was
somewhat
new
to
the
states,
which
is
why
there
was
a
delayed
effective
date,
and
which
is
why
the
secretary
in
promulgating
regulations
specifically
stated
that
he
made
the
determination
it
was
better
to
leave
the
flexibility
to
the
states
and
to
allow
states
to
make
their
determinations
of
how
they
were
going
to
meet
the
reasonable
efforts
clause,
allow
the
states
to
make
the
policy
decisions
of
how
to
balance
scarce
resources
and
allocate
scarce
resources
in
this
very
difficult
area.
it
is,
again,
i
think
important
to
note,
reasonable
efforts...
these
are
not
reasonable
efforts
to
conduct
negotiations
around
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
are--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--they
are
not
even
reasonable
efforts,
i
think,
to
set
reasonable
rates
or
reasonable
rents,
as
in
the
wright
case,
which
are
monetary
calculations
that
could
be
measured
against
a
marketplace,
and
in
addition,
this
court
required
specific
lengthy
factors
in
the
statute.
here
we
have
no
marketplace
for
reasonable
efforts,
and
we
have
a
much
more
difficult
decision
than
determining
what
are
reasonable
rates
or
reasonable
rents,
and
yet
the
plaintiffs
ask
us
to
find
a
federal
right
in
a
statute
that
provides
not
only
less
guidance
than
the
boren
amendment
or
the
regulations
in
wright,
but
absolutely
no
guidance
whatsoever.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
we
agree.
we
recognize
that
the
statute
requires
reasonable
efforts
in
each
case.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
well,
it
states--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--no,
what
we
think
is,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
violate
(a)(15),
which
requires
the
state
to
have
a
plan
that
provides
reasonable
efforts.
there
is
a
separate--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--there
is
a
separate
section,
section
672(a)
that
says
that
in
individual
cases,
that
in
order
to
receive
federal
reimbursement,
there
must
be
a
state
judicial
determination
of
whether
reasonable
efforts
were
made
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
now
it
is
also
the
case
however,
justice
scalia,
that
congress
recognized
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
cases
where
there
should
be
no
reasonable
efforts
made
at
all
because
of
the
best
interests
of
the
child
which
the
state
courts
are
required
to
balance
as
well
in
section
672
explicitly
and
this
individualized
decision
making
is
what
was
intended
under
the
reasonable
efforts
clause
because
the
clause
itself
reads,
in
each
case.
it
doesn't
say
a
system
of
reasonable
efforts,
which
is
what
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
here.
they
want
a
substantive
right
to
allow
a
federal
court
to
judge
whether
there
is
a
system
of
reasonable
efforts
by
the
state.
but
there
is
nowhere
in
the
statute,
the
plain
language
never
speaks
about
a
system
of
reasonable
efforts.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
it
speaks
of
a
plan--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--here
the
plan
is
an
actual
document,
as
in
many
other
federal
and
state
cooperative
funding
acts,
which
requires
that
the
state
put
together
a
document,
submit
it
to
the
secretary
and
have
it
approved.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
that's
right.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
is
the
plan.
now
the
plan
was
never
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
telling.
the
plaintiffs
here
are
not
suing
because
they
disagree
with
the
plan
that
was
approved--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--they
simply
never
raised
the
plan.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
they
never
raised
the
plan.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
say
there
is
not
just
a
right
to
a
plan,
but
a
substantive
right
beyond
the
plan
to
reasonable
efforts
which
they
define.
what
is
allows
them
to
do
and
it
allows
federal
courts
to
do
under
this
undefined
substantive
right
to
reasonable
efforts
is
to
peel
off
one
after
another
various
administrative
structures
in
the
states
and
hold
it
up
to
a
standard
of
reasonable
efforts,
and
it's
already
happening.
this
case
is
only
one
of
five
that
are
currently
pending
against
the
illinois
department
of
children
and
family
services,
taking
one
part
of
the
department's
structure
after
another
and
holding
it
up.
in
this
case,
it's
caseworker
assignment.
in
another
case,
it's
cash
assistance
and
housing
to
abusive
parents.
in
another
case
it's
parental
visitation,
and
in
yet
another
case,
it's
sibling
visitation.
in
fact,
there
are
13
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
that
currently
are
exposed
to
reasonable
efforts
lawsuits
taking
one
little
piece
after
another.
the
plaintiffs
have
even
cited
one
coming
out
of
the
third
circuit
most
recently
last
week,
in
which
a
visitation
rule
was
held
up
to
the
court
and
under
some
standard
which
we
don't
know
because
congress
didn't
give
us
a
measurement,
it
said
that
a
visitation
rule
of
1
hour
every
other
week
was
somehow
not
so
meager
that
it
fell
below
a
standard
of
reasonableness.
but
congress
has
not
provided
us
what
that
standard
would
be.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
what
the
reasonableness--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--it's
672.
i
believe
it's
in
petitioner's
brief.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
the
blue
brief.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
672(a)(1),
it's
not
quoted
in
full,
but
on
page
24,
it's
stated
that
the
foster
care
placement
must
be
the
result
of
a
judicial
determination
that
continuation
at
home,
quote,
"would
be
contrary
to
the
welfare
of
such
child,
and
that
reasonable
efforts
of
the
type
described
in
section
671(a)(15)
have
been
made.
"
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
yes,
it
is,
justice
kennedy.
it
is
a
uniquely
different
one.
it
is
a
determination
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
672
is
very
specific.
it's
on
the
individual
child
for
whom
the
state
seeks
federal
reimbursement,
there
must
be
an
individualized
determination
based
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
which
is,
as
we
submit,
the
only
way
you
can
determine
reasonableness.
you
have
to
look
at
the
risk
to
the
child.
you
have
to
look--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--no,
it's
not.
that
is
what
plaintiff
is
seeking...
in
fact,
plaintiffs
specifically
disavow
that
they
are
looking
for
that
individualized
determination,
which
is
the
only
judicial
determination
that
congress
intended
under
the
reasonable
efforts
clause.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
yes,
i
will,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
yes.
actually,
i
have
a
copy
here.
plaintiffs
completely
disavow
that
particular
inquiry.
they
are
seeking
a
systemic
right
to
reasonable
efforts,
which
simply
does
not
appear
anywhere
in
the
statute
at
all.
furthermore--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--no,
it
says
a
plan
that
provides
that
in
each
case,
reasonable
efforts
will
be
made.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
no.
it's
in
671(a)(15),
671(a)(15)
simply
says
that
the
plan
provide
that
in
each
case
reasonable
efforts
be
made.
it
doesn't
say
system.
elsewhere
in
the
statute
there
is
reference
to
a
case
review
system
which
indicates,
i
believe,
that
congress
knew
and
knew
how
to
use
the
word
system
when
it
wanted
to
use
system.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
no.
i
think
what
the
secretary's
regulations
say
is
what
reasonable
efforts
means
is
a
list
of
services.
there
may
not
be
one
system
for
providing
reasonable
efforts.
you
need
to
have
flexibility.
you
need
to
be
able
to
address
the
variation
of
problems
that
exist
in
a
state
in
this
very
volatile
and
highly
individualized
area
of
child
welfare
involving
abused
and
neglected
children.
the
circumstances
vary
a
great
deal.
we
don't
know
a
lot
about
what
works
to
keep
children
at
home.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
the
plan
simply
says
a
list
of
services,
that
the
states
to
comply
with
the
plan,
what
the
regulations
say,
is
that
there
is
a
list
of
services
which
states
may
choose
to--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--i
don't
believe
it's
quoted
in
full
but
it
is
also
cited
both
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
i
don't
think
that
is
a
question
that
has
been
directly
addressed
by
this
court.
it
may
well
fall
as
a
nonenforcement
decision
under
heckler
v.
chaney
and
may
be
precluded
from
suit
as
something
that
is
left
to
the--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--it's
an
analogous
inquiry,
i
think,
under
heckler
whether
there
is
no
law
to
apply,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.

three
brief
points.
in
response
to
justice
souter's
questions
regarding
the
record
and
the
allocation
of
state
resources,
when
the
district
court
indicated
its
intent
to
impose
a
3-day
across
the
board
mandatory
injunction
on
the
state,
the
state
administrator
over
the
case
assignment
process,
mr.
goad,
did
submit
a
supplemental
affidavit,
it's
at
the
district
court
record,
item
under
96
in
which
mr.
goad
stated
that
to
comply
with
the
3-day
across
the
board
injunction
which
was
not
what
the
state's
original
plan
was
with
respect
to
caseworker
assignment,
would
require
the
reallocation
of
resources
from
other
areas
in
the
department's
budget.
we
were
unclear--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--yes,
it
would
because
the
statute,
although
it's
not
in
the
record
as
a
factual
matter,
the
statute
itself
in
sections
672
and
674
makes
specific
what
title
iv-e
reimbursement
is
available.
it
is
available
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis.
if
the
state
spends
$1
for
foster
care,
for
maintenance
payments,
it
receives
50
cents
back
from
the
federal
government
and
there
is
a
small
administrative
sharing
of
the
costs
as
well.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
no,
i
think...
i
am
not
arguing
that,
but
i
am
arguing--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--what
relevance
it
has
is
that
in
fact
in
the
secretary's
regulations,
the
secretary
made
the
decision
not
to
implement,
not
to
promulgate
a
mandatory
regulation
that
said,
states,
you
must
do
this,
this
and
this
to
comply
with
reasonable
efforts,
because
in
promulgating
that
regulation,
the
secretary
said
that
the
difficult
decisions
of
how
to
allocate
scarce
resources
and
state
resources
in
this
area
must
be
left
to
the
states.
what
the
district
court
here
did
was
to
take
over
that
decision
making
for
the
state
and
say,
i
don't
care
that
you
have
to
take
money
away
from
other
services,
you
are
going
to
spend
money
to
assign
caseworkers
within
3
days.
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
in
the
instance,
in
section
672
where
there
is
individual
determinations
delegated
specifically
by
congress
to
the
states,
we
believe
it
is
a
matter
of
the
states
looking
at
their
individual
case
law,
how
they
weigh
best
interests
of
the
child--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--i
think
it's
the
state
law--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--defers
to
the
states.
it
defers
to
the
states
in
this
area--
ms.
christina
m.
tchen
--ultimately,
section
672,
we
believe,
gives
that
decision
to
the
states.
thank
you.
