mr.
michael
g.
dsida
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
turns
on
two
critical
issues.
first,
federal
courts
are
competent
in
applying
reasonableness
standards
of
the
type
at
issue
here,
and
their
task
is
especially
straightforward
in
this
context
when
the
defendants
have
made
no
efforts,
let
alone
the
reasonable
efforts
required
of
them
by
the
statute,
to
keep
families
together.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
our
complaint.
what
we
contended
in
our
complaint
was
that
the
defendants
had
failed
to
make
reasonable
efforts
and
it
was
clear--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--your
honor,
the
plan
also
must
be
in
effect...
it's
clear
that
the
statute
requires
that
the
specific
obligations
under
the
plan
must
be
implemented
by
the
state
and
that
has
been
this
court's
position
under
federal/state
cooperative--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--we
did
attack
the
plan.
we
didn't
use
the
word
state
plan
specifically,
but
we
did
attack
the
plan
in
that
defendants
have
failed
to
live
up
to
their
obligations
under
the
plan.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
the
plan--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--that
is
two
different
things,
your
honor.
i
think
defendants
correctly
stated
that
the
plan
is
different
from
their
obligation.
the
plan
is
simply
is
a
document
which
they
submit
to
the
secretary.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
the
statutory
language
requires
them
to
submit
a
plan
to
the
secretary--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--that's
not
our--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
the
question
today
is
whether
or
not
the
defendants
have
lived
up
to
their
obligations
under
the
plan.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
that
the
plan
is
reasonable?
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
the
plan
was
approved
by
the
secretary.
the
defendants
failed
to
adhere
to
their
obligations
under
the
plan.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
fair
assumption.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
defendants
failed
to
make
any
efforts
and
in
that
context
courts
are
competent
to
enforce
the
reasonableness
standard
provided
here.
the
second
crucial
point
here
is
that
enforcement
of
the
reasonable
efforts
requirement
will
preserve
only
the
most
limited
role
for
federal
courts
in
this
area--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--the
plan
contains
a
promise
by
the
state
of
illinois
to
make
reasonable
efforts
in
each
case,
and
they
did
not
do
that
here.
defendants
up
until
today
did
not
contest
before
the
court
that
issue.
there
is
no
dispute--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--the
plan
essentially
repeats
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
the
state
will
provide
that
reasonable
efforts
will
be
made
in
each
case.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
but
if
the
court
would
like,
we
could
submit
that.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
the
plan
contains
the
requirements
set
forth
by
the
statute
and
among
them--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--yes,
your
honor.
enforcing
this
particular
statutory
requirement
will
not,
will
preserve
only
the
most
limited
role
for
federal
courts
as
well,
but
it's
a
role
which
is
consistent
with
the
contract
entered
into
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
under
title
iv-e.
now
illinois
purports
to
adhere
to
this
obligation
by
assigning
a
caseworker
to
each
abused
and
neglected
child
in
his
or
her
family.
under
dcfs's
system,
the
caseworker
alone
is
responsible
for
providing
services
to
keep
children
in
their
own
homes,
and
for
providing
services
to
make
it
possible
for
children
to
return
to
their
homes
if
they
have
been
placed
in
foster
care.
but
as
the
district
court
found
in
plaintiff's
cases,
defendants
regularly
and
systematically
deprived
these
children
of
caseworkers
and
the
services
which
caseworkers
alone
can
provide
for
weeks
and
months
at
a
time.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
no,
your
honor.
the
ultimate
obligation
of
the
state
is
the
one
set
forth
by
congress
in
the
statute.
the
state
must
provide
reasonable
efforts
to
keep
these
children
with
their
families
or
to
return
them
to
their
families.
that
is
the
standard
which
the
courts
are
to
apply.
that's
the
obligation
which
defendants
admit
that
they
are
bound
to
adhere
to,
and
the
solicitor
general
agrees
on
that
point.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
no,
your
honor,
that's
the
obligation
which
we
contend
defendants
failed
to
adhere
to,
and
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
they
did
not.
the
district
court
found
that
in
plaintiff's
case,
that
defendants
regularly
deprived
children
of
caseworkers,
which
is
the
sole
means
dcfs
chose
to
use
under
their
system
to
implement
this
reasonable
efforts
requirement.
and
in
a
situation
like
this,
it's
very
straightforward
for
courts
to
enforce
and
apply
this
statute.
the
courts
below
needed
to
look
no
further--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--the
court
didn't
need
to
do
that,
but
what
it
was
doing
there
was
ultimately
crafting
its
remedy,
consistent
with
the
state's
approach
in
trying
to
resolve
the
problems
which
the
plaintiffs
had
presented.
and
the
court
looked
at
the
defendant's
plan
to
restructure
the
department
after
it
heard
extensive
evidence
that
the
defendants
had
regularly
and
systemically
deprived
these
children
of
caseworkers,
and
the
reasonable
efforts
which
only
caseworkers
can
provide.
so
the
court
looked
at
the
caseworkers
only
because
defendants
had
made--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--it
would
depend
on
the
particulars
of
that
case.
if
a
state
employed
another
technique
to
supposedly
provide
reasonable
efforts,
but
then
utterly
failed
to
do
so,
as
illinois
had
failed
to
do
here,
then
a
court
might
be...
it
might
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
look
at
the
particular
practices
of
that
state
to
provide
a
remedy
which
is
not
intrusive
and
which
would
not
involve
the
federal
courts
in
the
administration
of
the
state
agency's
operations,
and
that's
what
the
court
did
here.
it
employed
a
remedy,
exercising
its
broad
remedial
discretion,
which
was
consistent
with
the
state's
approach,
and
it
was
one
which
was
not
intrusive
and
one
which
provided...
which
essentially
deferred
to
the
state's
decisions
and
how
they
were
to
implement
the
requirements
of
this
statute.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
the
secretary
could
have
made
that
decision
in
this
case,
but
the
secretary
did
not.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
if
the
secretary
had
not
approved
the
plan?
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
presumably
the
state
would
have
then
responded
appropriately
in
resolving
their
violation
of
the
statute
in
that
regard.
but
what's
clear
here
is
that
the
court
can
determine
that
the
state
has
failed
to
live
up
to
its
obligations
to
make
reasonable
efforts.
courts
apply...
federal
courts
apply
reasonableness
standards
every
day.
it
is
a
central
part
of
the
task
of
any
federal
court
judge,
and
that
includes
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
a
party's
conduct
under
countless
federal
statutes.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
don't
think
the
courts
are
called
upon
under
this
statute
to
assess
whether
or
not
a
state
has
spent
its
money
appropriately.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
the
state
has
accepted
the
obligation
imposed
by
it
under
title
iv-e
by
accepting
substantial
federal
funding--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--your
honor,
under
this
court's
decision
in
wilder,
courts
would
be
obligated
or
plaintiffs
would
be
under
a
heavy
burden
to
show
that
a
particular
state's
conduct
was
not
reasonable,
did
not
meet
the
terms
of
the
statute,
so
courts
wouldn't
be
delving
into
the
minutia
of
the
state's
administration
and
the
state's
spending
of
the
funding.
but
what
this
case
is
about
is
that
the
state
has
made
no
efforts
and
although
there
may
be
gray
areas,
there
may
be
difficult
cases
for
courts
to
determine,
it's
clear
that
in
this
case,
the
state's
failure
to
make
any
efforts
to
keep
these
children
with
their
families,
and
its
failure
to
make
any
efforts
to
return
children
to
their
families
was
not
reasonable.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
the
assignment...
the
remedy
crafted
by
the
district
court
was
not
the
violation
that...
we
were
not
saying
that
failure
to
assign
caseworkers
is
required
under
the
statute.
what
we
alleged
was
that
defendants
were
not
making
reasonable
efforts.
under
their
system,
the
caseworker
is
the
linchpin,
the
only
way
the
defendants
make
reasonable
efforts,
and
we
asked
the
district
court
to
develop
a
remedy
consistent
with
the
state's
reliance
on
caseworkers--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
that
is
in
fact
what
we
asked,
but
that
is
the
remedy
that
the
district
court
choose
to
use
in
deference
to
the
state
agency
which
itself
elected
to
use
caseworkers
as
the
means
by
which
reasonable
efforts
are
made
in
each
case.
we
were
not
asking
to
impose
a
new
structure
on
the
state,
and
the
district
court
ultimately
deferred--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--your
honor,
ultimately
the
district
court--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--your
honor,
we
asked
the
district
court
to
order
the
defendants
to
provide
caseworkers,
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
was
based
on
extensive
testimony
and
extensive
records
documenting
the
importance
of
caseworkers
under
dcfs's
system.
if
the
state
determines
that
there
is
another
means
for
them
to
provide
reasonable
efforts,
there
is
another
avenue
for
them
to
adhere
to
the
obligations
under
the
statute,
they
can
go
back
in
front
of
the
district
court,
present
their
new
approach
to
the
court
and
say,
your
honor,
this
is
how
we--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
fair
characterization
of
our
position
here.
the
court
does
not
have
to
look
at
how
the
state
is
spending
the
money,
the
court
is
looking
at--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--should
federal
money
be
appropriated?
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
the
state
has
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
federal
government
and
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
the
ultimate
beneficiaries
of
that
contract.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
i
apologize.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
i
apologize,
your
honor.
ultimately,
your
honor,
it
would
require
looking
at
the
state's
budget,
and
it
may
in
this
case
require
the
agency
to
restructure
its
budget
in
such
a
way
to
fulfill
its
obligations
under
the
injunction.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
in
the
record.
but
defendants
have
accepted
substantial
federal
funding--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
the
defendants
have
shown
that
the
state
is
under
any
sort
of
financial
burden
which
the
court,
or
which
justice
souter,
you
were
concerned
about.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
defendants
have
presented
to
show
that
they
are
unable
to
adhere
or
comply
with
the
terms
of
the--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no...
the
record
doesn't
speak
to
how
the
money
is
divided
between
the
federal
and
the
state
governments
and
how
it
would
adhere
to
this
obligation.
but
ultimately
the
defendants
have
accepted
federal
funding
under
this
statute
and
they
concede
that
this
statute
imposes
a
binding
obligation
on
them.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
the
statute
envisions
that
the
costs
will
be
shared--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
and
in
fact,
section
674
provides
an
elaborate
funding
mechanism
to
determine
how
the
state
is
to
be
funded,
but
there
is
no
question
about
whether
or
not
defendants
are
under
this
obligation
to
make
reasonable
efforts.
the
sole
question
is
whether
or
not
courts
are
capable
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
state
has
violated
its
obligation
in
this
case.
the
record
makes
clear
that
in
this
case
they
have
not.
the
defendants
do
not
have
a
plan
in
effect
to
make
reasonable
efforts
to
prevent
or
eliminate
the
need
for
removing
these
children
from
their
homes.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
since
rosado
v.
wyman
that
the
secretary's
ability
to
cut
off
funding
under
a
federal/state
cooperative
funding
statute
does
not
preclude
enforcement
of
the
statute
under
section
1983
by
individual
plaintiffs,
and
that
is
the
case
here.
in
fact,
the
secretary--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--your
honor,
the
question
is
whether...
that
is
not
the
question
before
the
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
courts
are
competent
to
enforce
this
reasonableness
standard,
and
courts
enforce
reasonableness
standards
on
a
regular
basis.
it
is
a
central
task
of
federal
courts.
and
in
fact,
in
the
wilder
case,
less
than
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
this
court
again
affirmed
that
federal
courts
are
capable
of
enforcing
reasonableness
standards,
even
though
under
that
statute
federal
courts
would
be
required
to
look
at,
among
other
things,
what
constitutes
adequate
health
care,
what
constitutes
reasonable
access
to
adequate
health
care,
whether
or
not
the
state's
medicaid
rates
adequately
account
for
the
particular
needs
of
individual
hospitals
serving
a
disproportionately
large
number
of
low
income
patients.
in
short,
a
rather
complicated
inquiry,
but
one
which,
under
this
court's
decision
in
wilder,
the
courts
are
well-equipped
to
undertake,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
federal
courts
are
any
less
capable
of
enforcing
the
reasonableness
inquiry,
a
requirement
set
forth
in
this
statute.
in
fact,
the
state
court
enforcement
or
the
state
court
decisions
under
section
672
(a)(1)
provide
further
evidence
that
courts
generally
are
capable
of
assessing
whether
or
not
a
state
has
made
reasonable
efforts
to
keep
a
family
together,
and
defendants
present
no
reason
to
or
nothing
to
distinguish
federal
courts'
ability
to
enforce
that
standard
contained
in
this
federal
statute.
instead,
they
point
only
to
this
section
as
an
indication
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
enforcement
under
section
1983
of
this
statute,
but
that
state
court
determinations
under
this
section
occur
only
at
the
time
the
state
assumes
custody
of
the
child.
they
have
no
bearing
on
children
who
remain
in
their
homes
but
are
at
risk
of
being
removed
when
the
state
is
making
no
efforts
to
keep
them
there.
they
have
no
bearing
on
children
who
have
already
been
placed
in
foster
care
when
the
state
is
making
no
efforts
to
return
them
to
their
families.
these
determinations
under
section
672(a)(1)
provide
no
opportunity
for...
to
address
the
sort
of
systemic
grievances
which
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
remedy
here.
in
short,
this
provision
pales
in
comparison
to
the
express
cause
of
action
provided
by
congress
in
the
statutes
at
issue
in
smith
v.
robinson
or
national
sea
clammers,
which
this
court
found
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
preclude
enforcement
under
section
1983.
just
because
section
1983
is
available,
however,
does
not
mean
that
courts
will
be
flooded
with
challenges
to
particular
casework
decisions
in
individual
cases.
the
adoption
assistance
and
child
welfare
act,
like
the
boren
amendment,
the
provision
at
issue
in
wilder,
affords
states
substantial
discretion
in
how
they
are
to
implement
their
obligations
under
the
statute.
in
keeping
with
wilder
then,
plaintiffs
will
be
under
a
heavy
burden
to
show
that
the
state's
conduct
fell
outside
of
the
range
permitted
by
congress
under
the
statute.
in
fact,
in
the
winston
case
which
we
addressed
in
our
supplemental
memorandum,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
showed
how
this
heavy
burden
and
this
substantial
discretion
will
prevent
the
sort
of
flood
of
litigation
which
defendants
predict
from
ever
occurring.
in
that
case
the
court
first
confirmed
that
the
reasonable
efforts
requirement
created
enforceable
rights
under
section
1983
but
then
it
went
on
to
hold
that
pennsylvania's
visitation
policies
were
within
the
range
of
conduct
permitted
by
congress
under
the
statute.
pennsylvania
had
in
fact
exercised
appropriate
professional
judgment,
appropriate
discretion
in
setting
up
those
visitation
policies,
and
as
a
result
the
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
favor
of
the
state
and
county
defendants.
beyond
that,
beyond
this
heavy
burden
and
the
discretion
afforded
states,
collateral
estoppel
will
also
serve
to
preclude
what
in
all
likelihood
would
otherwise
be
the
bulk
of
claims
under
this
statute,
namely,
parents
challenging
the
decision
to
remove
a
child
from
the
home
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
under
heckler
v.
chaney
we
could
challenge
the
secretary's
decision
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
particular
state
plan.
i
don't
think
we
have
that
remedy
available.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
the
secretary
does
in
enforcing
the
state's
plan
is
looking
at
the
individual
cases
in
the
state
courts
and
determining
whether
or
not
the
state
court
orders
have
found
that
reasonable
efforts
have
been
made.
there
is
no
independent
assessment
of
the
state's
efforts,
either
in
the
individual
cases
or
on
a
systemic
basis.
the
secretary
simply
fails
to
do
that,
and
in
light
of
that,
the
secretary's
conduct
and
the
inclusion
of
the
secretary
in
the
remedial
scheme
doesn't
provide
the
sort
of
comprehensive
mechanism
necessary
for
close
enforcement
of
the
statute--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--yes,
your
honor,
under--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--our
remedy
is
the
federal
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
the
state
plan
includes
their
obligation
to
make
reasonable
efforts.
we
are
attempting
to
enforce
the
obligation
that
the
state
agrees
to
undertake,
to
make
reasonable
efforts
to
keep
families
together.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
i
am
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
we
cannot
review
the
secretary's
decision
in
that
context
pursuant
to
heckler
v.
chaney.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
our
claim
is
under
671
(a)(15).
that
is
the
provision
of
the
statute
of
that
we
are
contending
defendants
failed
to
adhere
to
here.
the
secretary's
determination
solely
relates
to
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
have
entered
these
particular
orders
at
the
time
the
court
takes
custody
of
the
children.
there
is
no
assessment
under
the
secretary's
approach
of
the
efforts
made
to
return
children
to
their
families,
and
there
is
no
assessment
under
the
secretary's
approach
of
efforts
made
at
the
time
children
are
in
their
homes
to
keep
them
in
their
homes,
and
independent
of
that,
your
honor,
independent
of
the
secretary's
approach,
this
court
has
held
that
the
secretary's
ability
to
cut
off
funding
or
approve
or
disapprove
a
plan
does
not
provide
an
indication
that
congress
intended
to
foreclose
enforcement
of
a
statute
under
section
1983,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
is
intended
to
provide
a
broad
remedy
for
violations
of
federal
rights,
privileges
and
immunities.
that
is
the
case
here.
defendants
have
violated
plaintiffs'
rights
under
the
statute
to
reasonable
efforts
to
keep
them
with
their
families.
the
adoption
assistance
and
child
welfare--
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
he
has
chosen
not
to
do
that,
your
honor.
but
that
does
not
preclude
our
ability
to
enforce
the
statute
under
section
1983.
the
adoption...
congress
enacted
this
statute
to
keep
children
out
of
foster
care
whenever
possible
and
enforcement
of
the
reasonable
efforts
requirement
is
consistent
with
that
purpose
and
is
required
by
the
structure,
the
language
and
the
history
of
the
act.
the
reasonable
efforts
requirement
is
at
the
heart
of
the
adoption
assistance
and
child
welfare
act
and
consistent
with
congress's
intent,
it
must
be
enforceable.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case.
heckler
v.
chaney
provides
the
state,
i
am
sorry,
provides
the
agency
substantial
discretion
in
determining
how
to
enforce
a
particular
statutory
provision.
mr.
michael
g.
dsida
your
honor,
if
i
recall
that
case,
your
honor,
i
think
ultimately
it
turned
on
whether
or
not
there
are
specific
standards
which
the
state
or
which
the
secretary
is
obligated
to
adhere
to
in
enforcing
the
statute.
there
are
no
particular
guidelines
or
there
is
no
flow
chart
or
something
to
that
effect
dictating
how
the
secretary
is
obligated
to
review
the
state's
plan.
the
secretary
does
in
fact
have
some
discretion
in
making
those
determinations,
but
there
is
not...
there
is
certainly
a
means
for
courts
or
the
secretary
to
use
in
reviewing
the
state's
plan,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
state
is
providing
reasonable
efforts.
and
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
defendants
simply
failed
to
provide
any
efforts
and
while
there
may
be
difficult
cases
under
this
statute,
this
case
is
not
one
of
them.
thank
you.
