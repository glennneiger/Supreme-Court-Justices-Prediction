what
about
the
sherman
act?
doesn't
the
sherman
act
do
the
same
thing
in
spades?
we
preempt
state
laws
regularly
on
the
basis
of
a
determination
that
the
courts
are
supposed
to
make,
that
there
has
been
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
may
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
not
because
it
is
too
vague.
i
mean,
what
does
vagueness
have
to
do
with
whether
the
right
exists
or
not?
you
cannot
create
the
right
unless
it
is
highly
defined?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
tchen,
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
statute
requires
the
state
to
make
reasonable
efforts
in
each
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
require
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
read
it,
the
section
we
are
talking
about,
671(a)(15)
requires
the
state
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
would
produce
reasonable
efforts,
but
nothing
is
perfect.
i
mean,
if
the
plan
provides
for
reasonable
efforts,
the
fact
that
now
and
then
it
may
in
a
particular
case
not
produce
that
would
not
seem
to
me
to
violate
(a)(15),
but
you
think
it
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
violate
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
is
that
quoted
in
672?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
been
looking
for
it.
i
can't
find
it.
672(a)(1).
justice
antonin
scalia
almost
as
vague
as
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
state
courts
supposed
to
use?
it's
the
same
language
that
the
state
courts
are
supposed
to
apply
under
672
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
a
different
theory
now.
if,
as
you
say,
all
they
are
trying
to
do
is
get
the
state
to
live
up
to
the
state's
promise
under
the
plan,
the
benchmark
should
not
be
the
very
vague
reasonableness
standard
of
the
statute,
but
rather
the
benchmark
should
be
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
does
the
plan
say
that
in
so
many
words,
we
promise
to
make
reasonable
efforts
in
each
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
should
state
money?
i
mean,
it's
a
state/federal
mix,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dsida,
i
think
you
may
well
be
right,
that
the
statute
is
not
as
comprehensive
as
other
ones
that
we
have
found
whose
comprehensiveness
precludes
the
inferring
of
any
private
right.
but
comprehensiveness
aside,
you
have
here
a
statute
that
at
the
general
level
puts
the
thing
in
the
lap
of
the
secretary.
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
secretary
to
determine
whether
a
plan
is
adequate
or
not
and
he
can
disapprove
a
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
may
be
a
lawsuit
available
to
set
aside
his
approval
of
a
plan,
that's
conceivable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
secretary
could
approve
a
plan
that
is
grossly
inadequate?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
your
remedy
be?
you
have
none?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
you
say
you
are
here
enforcing
the
secretary's
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
here
enforcing
the
secretary's
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
saying,
this
is
a
statute
that
does
not
allow
the
direct
review
of
the
secretary's
disapproval
of
a
plan
but
somehow
achieves
the
same
result
through
672
(a)?
i
mean,
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
you
are
saying
if
the
plan
is
inadequate
you
can
kick
it
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
the
secretary
approves
an
inadequate
plan.
you
say
there
is
no
direct
action
to
stop
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
however,
you
can
under
672
(a)
come
in
and
say
what
the
secretary
has
said
is
good
enough
is
not
good
enough
because
the
state
promised
to
do
not
only
what
the
secretary
said
was
enough,
but
reasonable
efforts.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dsida,
the
secretary
has
the
power
that
you
are
asserting
as
well,
right,
under
671
(b),
the
secretary
could
cut
off
funds
for
failure
of
the
state
to
keep
up
its
promises,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
has
chosen
not
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
tchen,
i
really
don't
understand
this
argument.
you
don't
really
think
that
if
the
state
comes
in
and
pleads
poverty
to
the
secretary
and
says,
we
are
a
very
poor
state
and
therefore,
we
are
going
to
make
no
efforts,
for
us
that
is
reasonable,
we
are
so
poor
that
nothing
is
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
relevance
does
that
have?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
just
deference,
ultimately.
