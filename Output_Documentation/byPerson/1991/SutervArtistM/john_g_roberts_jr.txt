chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
we
don't
believe
that
an
action
against
the
secretary
would
lie
because
it
would
involve
issues
of
prosecutorial
discretion
and
no
law
to
apply,
so
there
wouldn't
be
a
direct
action
against
the
secretary
under
the
apa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
discretion
of
how
to
enforce
the
requirements
of
the
statute
against
the
states,
yes.
the
secretary
may
well
decide
that
the
resources
are
better
used
providing
care
even
though
the
state
is
not
complying
and
then
taking
other
steps
to
ensure
compliance.
but
no
individual
would
have
a
right
to
sue
the
secretary,
to
compel
the
secretary
to
cut
off
funds
to
the
state.
the
court
below
erred
in
this
case
in
concluding
that
the
reasonable
efforts
proviso
was
sufficiently
specific
and
definite
to
create
a
right
enforceable
under
section
1983.
i
think
the
issue
is
most
clearly
posed
by
asking
the
question,
reasonable
with
respect
to
what?
the
statute
provides
no
answer.
this
is
not
a
case
like
wilder
where
the
statute
provided
for
reasonable
rates,
but
then
went
on
at
some
length
to
specify
what
that
meant:
rates
to
meet
the
costs
that
must
be
incurred
by
efficiently
and
economically
operated
hospitals
providing
care
in
accordance
with
federal
and
state
law.
this
court
in
wilder
said
that
that
statutory
language
provided
an
objective
benchmark
against
which
to
assess
the
reasonableness
of
rates.
here,
the
statute
provides
none.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
first
of
all,
the
sherman
act
specifically
directs
the
courts
to
enforce
the
provision.
there
is
no
such
direction
to
federal
courts
in
this
case.
second
of
all,
i
think
the
sherman
act
does
provide
an
objective
benchmark:
the
standard
of
free
market
competition
which
the
courts
can
use
in
applying
those
vague
terms
as
well.
in
this
case
the
regulations
also
don't
answer
the
question,
reasonable
with
respect
to
what?
the
case
is
therefore
not
like
this
court's
decision
in
wright
where
the
court
relied
on
regulations
defining
what
was
included
in
rent
in
holding
that
tenants
could
enforce
a
rent
ceiling
under
section
1983.
here
the
secretary
specifically
determined
not
to
define
reasonable
efforts
in
the
implementing
regulations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
secretary
can
enforce
the
reasonable
efforts
provision
by
engaging
in
precisely
the
sort
of
social
policy
judgments
that
are
entrusted
to
an
expert
administrative
agency
but
which
are
not
entrusted
under
our
system
to
the
federal
courts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
secretary's
determination
of
what's
reasonable
in
specific
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
knows
by
making
the
sorts
of
policy
judgments
on
each
case,
as
a
state
submits
a
particular
plan
and
they
say
here
is
what
we
are
going
to
do
to
comply
with
reasonable
efforts,
the
secretary
makes
policy
judgments--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
other
than
reasonable
efforts,
that
is
what
confines
the
secretary's
discretion.
it
is
a
very
broad--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
doesn't
confine
the
secretary's
more
than
a
judge's,
but
the
secretary,
the
congress
determined,
had
the
expert
experience
in
the
field
of
child
welfare
to
make
the
policy
judgments.
there
are,
as
we
indicated,
no
right
answers
in
this
area,
but
congress
entrusted
the
secretary
in
applying
the
act
to
come
up
with
good
policy
judgments.
they
may
be
different
in
different
cases--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
guidance
is
simply
reasonable
efforts
to
keep
families
together
and
to
provide
for
the
return
of
the
children.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
except
that
in
this
case
there
are
no
objective
standards
to
which
a
court
can
resort.
in
those
other
cases
there
are.
now,
some
of
respondent's
amici
do
say
there
are
objective
standards.
the
national
association
of
social
workers,
for
example,
says
that
the
objective
standards
are
those
published
and
endorsed
by
the
national
association
of
social
workers.
and
that
highlights
the
problem
in
this
case.
congress
refrained
from
enacting
any
such
specific
standards
in
the
statute.
the
secretary
declined
to
enact
any
such
specific
standard
in
the
regulations,
though
she
was
urged
to
do
so.
and
now
these
groups
come
before
this
court
and
urge
this
court
to
elevate
their
professional
standards
to
the
level
of
an
enforceable
federal
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
courts
can
apply
it
in
the
context
of
a
particular
removal
decision
involving
a
particular
child
and
a
particular
family
history.
the
federal
courts...
the
respondents
disclaim
any
such
role
for
the
federal
courts
under
section
1983.
they
are
much
more
interested
in
defining
on
a
systemic
level
in
the
abstract
what
constitutes
reasonable
efforts.
the
state
courts
look
to
the
particular
case,
what
the
state
has
done
for
this
child
against...
and
balance
that
against
the
asserted
need
to
remove
the
child
from
the
home.
now
the
respondents
may
not
agree
with
their
amici
on
the
source
of
the
standards
to
apply
in
this
case,
but
if
it's
not
those
standards,
which
standards?
if
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
enforce
a
supposed
right
to
reasonable
efforts,
the
first
thing
they
are
going
to
have
to
do
is
set
an
objective
benchmark
against
which
to
assess
reasonableness,
and
that
exercise
involves
policy
judgments
beyond
the
competence
of
the
article
3
branch,
not
beyond
their
competence
in
the
sense
that
judges
would
be
incapable
of
coming
up
with
an
answer
in
any
particular
case,
but
beyond
their
competence
in
the
sense
that
it
moves
the
courts
from
adjudication
of
particular
cases
and
controversies
to
the
setting
of
social
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
it
sets
forth
in
its
plans
how
it
intends
to
comply
with
the
requirement
and
the
secretary
either
accepts
it
or
rejects
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
place,
that's
not
what
is
involved
here.
the
state's
plan
says
nothing
about
providing
a
caseworker
within
3
days
and
the
federal
court
is
simply
enforcing
that
requirement.
the
state's
plan
says
nothing
of
the
sort.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
simply
lists
the
state
services
that
are
available,
through
which
it
intends
to
comply
with
the
requirement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
means
that
in
each
case
reasonable
efforts
will
be
made,
and
here
is
an
array
of
services
from
which
they
can
draw.
it
doesn't
mean
that
every
service
will
be
available
in
every
case.
in
some
cases
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
in
some
cases
that
may
be
appropriate.
if
you
have
a
situation
where
immediate
removal
of
the
child
is
demanded
for
health
and
safety
reasons,
no
efforts
at
keeping
the
family
together
may
be
the
appropriate
efforts.
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs
here
is
at
least
three
steps
removed
from
the
statutory
language.
on
its
face
this
statute
simply
sets
forth
a
contract
between
the
united
states
and
the
state,
confers
no
rights
on
anyone.
if
there
are
any
rights,
it
would
seem
to
be
simply
rights
to
what
the
statute
provides,
a
plan
providing
for
reasonable
efforts
approved
by
the
secretary.
illinois
has
a
plan,
does
provide
for
reasonable
efforts,
has
been
approved
by
the
secretary.
if
there
were
any
further
right
to
actual
implementation
of
the
plan
it
would
be
seem
to
be
just
that,
implementation
of
the
plan.
here
the
plaintiffs
and
the
court
go
beyond
that
and
set
forth
the
requirement
of
3
days
in
every
case
though
the
state
plan
says
nothing
about
that.
we
are
not
told
why
3
days
is
reasonable
in
every
case
while
the
9
to
10-day
average
of
the
state
is
not,
nor
for
that
matter,
why
3
days
is
reasonable
here
when
the
first
circuit
determined
that
24
hours
was
needed
to
meet
the
reasonableness
requirement.
the
point
is
that
determining
how
quickly
a
caseworker
capable
of
providing
services
should
be
assigned
to
a
new
case
involves
basic
policy
judgments
about
the
allocation
of
limited
resources
in
a
child
welfare
system,
the
sort
of
policy
judgments
entrusted
to
the
states
in
the
first
instance
and
to
the
secretary.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
