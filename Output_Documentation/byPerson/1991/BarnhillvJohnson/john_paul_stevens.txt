justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
a
little
different
question
on
post-dating?
supposing
that
93
days
before
bankruptcy
a
post-dated
check
was
delivered
dated
7
days
later,
just
not
a...
forget
the
30-day
problem,
just
think
about
a
7-day
problem
for
a
moment.
would
you
say
the
date
of
delivery
or
the
date
of
the
check
is
the
critical
date?
justice
stevens
so
the
date
of
delivery
rule
for
which
you're
arguing
is
one...
the
date
of
delivery
or
date
of
the
check,
whichever
is
later.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
look
at
the
matter
as
a
completed
transaction
under
your
analysis
at
the
time
of
the
delivery,
it
is
a
completed
transaction
which
did
not
involve
the
transfer
of
an
interest
in
property.
justice
stevens
in
what
property?
justice
stevens
did
it
transfer
an
interest
in
the
bank
account,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
little...
your
position
is
date
of
delivery,
assuming
the
check
is
honored
within
30
days.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
question
that,
because
perhaps
it's
the
same
point
justice
scalia
made,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
subsection
(e)(1)(b)
contemplates...
it
refers
to
transfers
of
fixtures
or
property
other
than
real
property,
and
surely
contemplates
that
a
transfer
can
occur
before
it
has
been
perfected,
because
it
talks
about
a
transfer,
when
a
transfer
will
be
perfected,
and
then
in
(e)(2)
it
says
it's
perfected
if
it's
within
10
days
and
another...
you
can't
get
another
lien
against
the
property.
now,
if
the
transfer
date
and
the
perfection
date
are
different,
doesn't
the
date
of
honor
establish
the
perfection
date
and
the
date
of
delivery
establish
the
transfer
date?
why
isn't
that
a
correct
analysis?
justice
stevens
i
understand--
justice
stevens
--but
would
you
not
agree
that
the
point
you're
describing
is
the
point
at
which
the
transfer
has
been
perfected?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
that
with
respect
to
checks,
delivery
of
checks,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
transfer
date
and
the
perfection
date.
