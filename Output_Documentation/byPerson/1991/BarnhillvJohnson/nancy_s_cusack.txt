ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
arland
has
already
indicated,
this
case
revolves
around
an
attempt
by
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
recover
money
as
a
voidable
preference
under
section
547(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
check
which
is
at
the
center
of
this
controversy
is
a
check
which
was
post-dated.
it
was
dated
and
delivered
prior
to
the
90-day
preference
period
but
in
fact
was
honored
on
the
90th
day,
prior
to
the
bankruptcy
filing.
it
is
in
this
context
that
the
court
must
decide
whether,
for
purposes
of
547(b),
it
is
the
date
of
honor
or
the
date
of
delivery
which
controls,
and
in
making
that
decision
whether
or
not
the
bankruptcy
court
acted
properly
in
dismissing
our
lawsuit,
which
had
initially
been
filed--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--i
don't
think
in
fact
it
is
irrelevant,
because--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--well,
under...
our
contention
is
that
when
a
transfer
takes
place
it
is
to
be
determined
in
accordance
with
state
law,
and
under
state
law,
in
fact,
a
post-dated
check
is
considered
generally
speaking
to
be
effective
as
of
the
date
of
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
i
believe
it
is,
sir.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
our
position
is
also
that--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--currently
dated
check
is
also
the
date
of
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
well,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
that's
not
what
the
whole
thing
is.
for
there
to
be
a
valid
assignment
or
a
valid
transfer
it's
contemplated
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
transfer
of
dominion
or
control
over
the
property
being
assigned
or
being
transferred,
and
in
fact--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--but...
i'm
sorry
to
disagree
with
you,
but
as...
i
don't
see
that
there
is
an
assignment,
because
of
the
fact
that
had
there
been
a
valid
assignment,
a
valid
transfer,
in
fact
the
transferor
would
have
had
no
further
ability
to
deal
with
those
funds
and
the
transferee
would
have
had
the
ability
to
deal
with
those
funds,
and
that's
not
what
happens.
a
check
is
issued,
and
up
until
the
time
that
that
check
is
honored,
the
issuer
retains
the
ability
to
stop
payment
on
that
check,
to
close
the
account,
to
issue
other
checks,
which
may
in
effect
have
the
effect
of
depleting
the
account
and
rendering
that
check
absolutely
useless;
in
addition
the
account
can
be
garnished,
so
in
fact
there
is
no
transfer
or
no
change
in
control
or
dominion
over
those
funds,
so
that
in
fact
there
is
no
assignment,
no
transfer
of
interest
in
property,
and
that
will
not
take
place
until
such
time
as
that
check
is
honored.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
well,
actually,
your
honor,
i
do
think
it's
a
question
of
state
law.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
the
court...
under
the
context
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
first
of
all
congress
has
received
constitutional
authority
to
establish
uniform
laws
on
the
subject
of
bankruptcies
throughout
the
united
states,
and
congress
exercised
that
authority
by
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code.
under
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
code
there
were
some
general
definitions
given
in
terms
of
what
a
transfer
was.
101
indicates
that
a
transfer
is
a
method
or
a
mode
of
disposing
of
an
interest
in
property.
however,
it's
clear,
and
the
mckenzie
case
makes
it
clear,
that
there
are
certain
issues
that
have
not
been
dealt
with
within
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
and
have
not
been
specifically
defined,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
has
been
a
policy
to
have
certain
issues
determined
in
accordance
with
state
law,
and
one
of
those
issues
is
when
the
transfer
takes
effect,
when
a
transfer
is
made,
and
so
that
in
fact
is
an
issue
that
is
determined
in
the
court--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--well,
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
did
refer
to
the
mckenzie
case.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
that
wasn't
the
specific
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
no,
sir,
you're
right.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
a
transfer
only
took
place
at
such
time
as
the
check
was
honored,
which
in
fact
is
consistent
with
what
our
state
law
indicates.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
absolutely.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
as
adopted
in
the
state
of
new
mexico,
which
again
provides
that
a
transfer
takes
place
upon
honor.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
well,
let
me
remind
the
court
that
in
this
specific
instance
what
we're
doing
is
attempting
to
recover
the
money,
and
with
respect
to
money
you
cannot
have
a
transfer
made
until
you
have
it
in
hand.
likewise,
you
cannot
perfect
an
interest
in
money
until
you
are
holding
that
money
in
your
hand.
this
section,
though,
can
also
contemplate
situations
where,
for
example,
a
transfer
is
made
as
between
two
parties
and
yet
it's
not
perfected
until
such
time
as
to
third
parties.
there
is
no
creditor
that
can
come
in
and
take
a
superior
interest.
for
example,
a
deed
to
a
house.
i
may
deed
my
house
to
you,
but
if
the
deed
is
not
recorded,
while
the
transfer
may
be
effective
between
the
two
of
us,
it's
simply
not
perfected
until
such
time
as
that
is
filed
of
record.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
but
there's
no
enforceable...
again,
what...
first
of
all,
what
we're
seeking
to
recover
under
547(b)
is
not
a
recovery
of
that
claim
for
money.
we
are
seeking
within
the
parameters
of
the
preference
suit
to
recover
that
$157,000
which
in
fact
was
transferred
and
which
mr.
barnhill
received.
getting
the
check
back,
which
represents
the
chose
in
action,
isn't
going
to
do
anything
as
far
as
the
bankruptcy
estate
or
the
trustee
is
concerned.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
i
think
our
position
in
that
instance
would
be
different
if
he
could
enforce
it
against
the
bank,
but
in
fact
he
cannot.
as
i
indicated
previously,
congress
has
constitutional
authority
to
establish
uniform
laws
and
has
enacted
that
authority
by
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code.
what
is
a
transfer
and
when
it
is
completed
is
necessarily
a
federal
question
because
it
does
arise
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
statute,
which
of
course
is
intended--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--the
federal
question
has
not
been
answered,
and
consequently
in
accordance
with
the
mckenzie
case
the
court
has
said
that
in
the
event
that
that
question
is
not
answered
pursuant
to
law,
then
it
becomes
a
matter
of
deference
to
the
state.
it's
a
state
law
in
this
case
that
governs.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
if
it's
not
answered
by
the
federal
statute,
and
it's
certainly...
the
issue
of
when
a
transfer
is
made
specifically
is
not
answered
within
the
statute.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
no.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
what
new
mexico
recognizes
is
that
when
a
check
is
tendered
there
is
a
conditional
payment
and
there
is
a
doctrine
of
relation
back
that
is
in
effect
in
the
state
of
new
mexico,
and
what
new
mexico
recognizes
is
that
that
conditional
payment
is
subject
to
the
condition
of
a
transfer
taking
place.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
no,
i
think
it's
very
similar.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--in
this
regard,
or
is
it
the
same?
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
it's
the
same
as
the
law
in
most
states.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
i
think
that
the
delivery
of
the
check
comes
within
the
definition
of
what
a
transfer
is
under
101--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--because
101
is
a
very
expansive
definition
and
it
indicates,
at
least
in
my
mind,
that
one
way
that
an
individual
can
make
a
transfer
of
an
interest
in
property
is
indirectly
through
the
delivery
of
the
check.
however,
what's
important
for
purposes
of
547(b)
is
making
a
determination
in
fact
when
the
transfer
takes
place
so
that
the
trustee
knows
and
the
other
creditors
know
what
assets
ultimately
will
be
available
for
distribution
to
those
creditors
and
to
the
estate.
under
547(b)
the
trustee
is
allowed
to
recover
any
transfers
of
a
debtor's
interest
in
property
so
long
as
certain
things
have
made...
so
long
as
those
transfers
have
been
made
within
90
days
and
they
have
been
payment
for
an
antecedent
debt,
and
it's
again
going
back
to
the
idea
of
dominion
and
control.
there
in
fact
is
no
transfer
between
the
transferor
or
the
transferee
until
those
funds
have
been
tendered
and
until...
and
in
actuality
those
funds
have
been
removed
from
the
bankruptcy
estate.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
okay,
our
contention
is
with
respect
to
money,
the
assets
that
we
are
seeking
to
recover,
there
is
no
transfer
of
those
funds
until
such
time
as
the
transferor
loses
dominion
or
control
over
those
funds--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--and
the
transferee
is
able
to
exercise
control
and
in
this
circumstance--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--but
it's
also
the
point
in
time
when
the
transfer
has
been
made.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
when
you're
dealing
with
a
check,
that's
correct.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
no,
sir,
we're
not--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--no,
sir,
we're
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
we're
seeking
to
recover
is
$157,000
that
was
paid
to
mr.
barnhill
as
a
result
of
a
settlement
agreement
that
had
been
reached,
so
no,
we're
not
seeking
to
recover
any
funds--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--it
was
paid
to
him
by
the
debtor,
so
we're
not
seeking
to
recover
any
money
from
the
bank.
we're
seeking
to
recover
a
preferential
transfer
from
mr.
barnhill.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
well,
we're
asserting
a
claim
for
those
funds
once
mr.
barnhill's
check
is
honored,
which
will
in
effect
increase
our
estate.
so
long
as
that--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--that's
correct,
and
if
mr.
barnhill
issues
us
a
check
and
it's
not
honored,
then
there
will
be
no
transfer
of
any
funds
and
no
increase
for
the
benefit
of
the
estate,
that
is
correct.
but
i
also
might
remind
the
court
that
the
drawer
will
retain
full
control
over
that
chose
in
action
until
such
time
as--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--the
payment
is
conditional,
and
it
is
conditional
upon
the
transfer
being
made.
in
fact,
there
is--
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
--that's
right,
the
payee
cannot
enforce
it
against
the
bank
because
again
he
has
no
right
to
exercise
any
kind
of
dominion
or
control.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
absolutely,
or
that
the
funds
may
be
garnished
or
levied
against.
so
in
other
words,
there
are
many
things
that
can
happen,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
these
checks
are
outstanding.
under
547(b)
in
essence
there
is
a
mandate,
if
you
will,
that
the
trustee
look
not
only
what
assets
are
there
in
the
estate
as
of
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy
filing,
but
in
fact
that
he
take
a
backward
look
and
look
to
see
what
assets
were
in
the
bankruptcy
estate
and
make
a
determination
as
to
what
happened
to
those
assets
in
the
90
days
immediately
preceding
the
bankruptcy.
if
the
trustee,
in
doing
that,
and
in
doing
his
preference
screening,
looks
on
the
90th
day
immediately
preceding
the
bankruptcy
filing,
looks
to
see
what's
in
the
account,
regardless
of
how
many
checks
may
be
issued
and
how
many
checks
may
be
outstanding,
the
fact
is
that
as
of
that
period
in
time
it
is
the
debtor
who
has
control
over
all
of
the
funds
which
remain
in
the
bank
account.
again,
the
issue
of
control
and
dominion
over
those
funds
becomes
material.
mr.
arland
has
indicated
that
a
date
of
delivery
rule
will
conform
with
modern
commercial
practice,
and
he
has
indicated
repeatedly
that
when
a
transaction
is...
or
when
a
check
is
given
the
transaction
stops.
in
fact,
that's
an
oversimplification
of
what
happens.
first
of
all,
i
think
intuitively
one
can
see
that
payment
by
check
is
not
the
same
as
payment
by
cash.
for
example,
if
i
issue
a
check,
i'm
assured
of
the
fact
that
i
will
be
asked
for
an
id
because
of
the
fact
that
if
the
check
is
not
honored
the
transaction
will
not
stop.
in
many
states,
including
the
state
of
new
mexico,
statutes
prohibit
certain
transactions
from
going
forward
until
cash
or
immediately
available
funds
are
in
place,
and
in
addition
i
think
that
one
has
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
ucc
provides
that
a
tender
of
a
check,
in
and
of
itself,
does
not
operate
to
terminate
an
obligation,
but
in
fact
only
operates
to
suspend
that
obligation
and
to
suspend
until
it's
determined
whether
or
not
the
check
has
paid
the
obligation
which
has
to
be
collected.
i
think
that
under
the
terms
of
the
date
of
honor
rule
there
is
certainly
a
unity
of
law
that
is
presented,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
code
has
consistently
deferred
certain
matters
to
decisions
under
state
law.
for
example,
exemptions
are
decided
under
state
law.
the
fact
that
a
determination
of
when
a
transfer
is
made
is
to
be
decided
under
state
law
is
also
consistent
with
that
unity,
in
effect
helps
to
promote
that
by
in
fact
ensuring
that
someone
who
does
business
in
a
certain
state
is
not
going
to
receive
a
windfall
or
be
unduly
penalized
in
the
event
that
an
individual
goes
into
bankruptcy.
he
can
also
structure
his
or
her
commercial
transactions
in
such
a
way
so
that
he
knows
that
in
terms
of
consistency
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
federal
court
is
going
to
be
consistent
with
what
happens
in
the
state
court.
for
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
for
an
adoption
or
for
a
determination
that
in
fact
it
is
the
state
law
that
controls
in
making
a
determination
when
a
transfer
takes
place,
and
that
in
fact
the
court
reject
the
implementation
of
a
date
of
delivery
rule.
ms.
nancy
s.
cusack
i'm
not
aware
of
any
states
where
that
would
be
different.
basically,
the
states
have
all
gone
ahead
and
passed
the
uniform
commercial
code,
and
basically
it's
in
effect
throughout
all
50
of
the
states,
so
i'm
not
aware
of
any
situation
where
any
state
is
in
a
differing
situation.
i
do
think
the
cases
that
have
evolved
are
consistent,
that
in
fact
a
transfer
of
a
debtor's
interest
in
property
when
a
check
is
issued,
or
when
there
has
been
a
check
issued,
that
transfer
under
the
ucc
takes
place
at
the
time
the
check
is
honored.
again,
there
is
no
assignment
of
any
funds
in
the
account,
and
there's
no
transfer
of
that
dominion
or
control
until
such
time
as
that
happens.
