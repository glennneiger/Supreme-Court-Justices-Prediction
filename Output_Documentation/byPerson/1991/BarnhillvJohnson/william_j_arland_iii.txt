mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
today
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
johnson
v.
barnhill.
the
purpose
today
is
to
uphold
the
intent
of
congress
and
to
promulgate
the
policies...
the
public
policies
espoused
by
congress
in
the
bankruptcy
laws,
to
promote
unity
of
the
law,
equal
distribution
among
creditors
of
equal
priority
of
the
property
of
the
estate
of
the
debtor,
and
to
in
fact
bring
the
preference
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
into
conformity
with
modern
commercial
practices
and
the
uniform
commercial
code.
the
specific
section
which
is
being
challenged
at
this
time
is
section
547(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
uphold
and
to
find
that
a
date
of
delivery
rule
for
the
purposes
of
547(b)
satisfies
and
meets
and
promotes
the
three
policies
just
mentioned
as
opposed
to
a
date
of
honor
rule.
section
11,
or
11
u.s.c.
547(b)
describes
the
purposes,
or
the
events
and
transactions,
by
which
a
trustee
may
set
aside
transfers
made
by
a
debtor
to
its
creditors.
it
does
not
define
within
547(b)
itself
what
a
transfer
is,
nor
does
it
delineate
whether
or
not
a
rule...
a
date
of
delivery
rule
or
a
date
of
honor
rule
should
be
adopted
in
analyzing
whether
or
not
the
transactions
fall
inside
the
preference
window,
which
is
the
90-day
period
immediately
preceding
a
filing
of
the
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
essentially
very
short
and
very
simple.
on
november
18,
1985,
the
debtor,
alan
antweil,
delivered
to
william
barnhill,
a
creditor
of
antweil,
a
check.
the
check
was
dated
november
19,
1985.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
do
not
know
why
it
was
post-dated
one
day,
justice
blackmun.
i
do
know
that
it
was
delivered
in
the
evening
of
november
18.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
if
it
were
post-dated
a
month
or
so,
i
believe
it
would
be
different,
justice
blackmun.
it
would
in
fact
not
be
a
contemporaneous
exchange
and
would
not
be
a
cash
transaction
as
a
check
is
normally
looked
to.
the
post-dating
here
was
only
one
day,
and
in
effect
it
became
a
cash
transaction
the
very
next
day
on
november
19.
the
check
was
presented
for
honor
on
november
20
and
was
honored
by
the
bank.
the
november
20
date
is
the
90th
date,
so
that
for
the
purposes
of
547(b)
the
transfer
if
a
date
of
honor
rule
is
accepted
would
be
on
or
within
the
90-day
period,
november
20
being
the
day--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--i'm
sorry--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--november
20,
justice
blackmun,
is
the
final
date
here,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
not
based
on
547(c)
itself.
my
response
to
justice
blackmun
was
merely
centered
upon
the
effect
of
giving
a
post-dated
check
in
a
transaction,
the
difference
being,
i
believe,
when
a
check
is
considered
a
credit
transaction
and
when
a
check
is
considered
a
cash
transaction.
inasmuch
as
the
post-dating
was
only
one
date,
and
that
date,
the
november
19,
was
still
outside
the
preference
window,
the
date
of
the
check
being
outside
the
preference
window,
it
became
a
cash
transaction
on
november
19,
and
so
it
had
no
application
with
respect
to
a
credit
transaction
that
would
have
fallen
within
the
preference
period.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
would
be
the
position,
and
i
believe
in
that
instance
that
in
fact
the
transaction
would
have
fallen
within...
if
it
was...
quite
frankly,
according
to
the
uniform
commercial
code,
had
the
post-dating
exceeded
30
days,
which
i
believe
section
3503
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
provides
that
if
a
check
is
presented
for
honor
within
30
days
of
its
date
of
delivery,
then
it
is
essentially
considered
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
essentially
is
a
cash
transaction.
if
it
exceeds
the
reasonable
time
of
30
days,
then
in
fact
the
transaction
date
is
the
date
the
check
is
honored,
so
that
if
the
day
that
justice
blackmun
was
referring
to
were
31
days
or
greater...
the
presentment
date
was
31
days
or
greater
than
the
date
of
the
check,
then
by
all
means
it
was
a
credit
transaction
and
the
transaction
would
have
fallen
within
the
preference
period
as
long
as
the
honoring
was
done
31
days
after
the
date
of
the
check.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
in
any...
if...
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
speaking
specifically
about
547(c),
in
which
it
is
as
surety
for
it,
i
believe
that
it
would
be.
to
answer
your
question
directly,
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
it
would
be
a
credit
transaction
until
the
date
of
the
check,
at
which
time
it
does
become
a
cash
transaction.
we
have
another
element
there,
justice
o'connor,
of
the
check
being
presented
as
security.
normally
a
check,
in
commercial
practice
when
a
check
is
presented
it
is
considered
a
cash
transaction
as
long
as
it
is
honored
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
the
date
of
the
check
is
equivalent
to
the
date
of
delivery.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
justice
scalia,
the
two
issues
that
are
raised
are,
one,
the
reasonable
period
of
time
from
presentment
for
honor
from
date
of
the
check
is
30
days.
the
second
part
is
that
if
the
check
is
presented
or
honored
subsequent
to
the
30
days,
is
that
the
date
of
honoring?
i
am...
my
interpretation
and
understanding
of
the
code
is
that
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
30
days
is
reasonable.
i
am
not
certain--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--30
days
from
the
date
on
the
check
is
reasonable.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
subsequent
to
the
30
days
if
it
is
presented
for
honor
that
is
not
reasonable,
and
that
is
considered
the
day
of
the
transaction
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
it
does,
justice
scalia...
it
does.
it
becomes
a
cash
transaction
at
the
time
that
the
check
can
be
honored
and
is
presented
at
that
time.
to
that
extent,
if
one
presents
a...
does
not
present
a
check
within
that
30-day
period,
then
the
uniform
commercial
code
i
believe
tells
us
that
in
fact
that
is
not
substantially
a
cash
transaction,
because
the
giving
of
a
check
is
a
conditional
transfer
as
defined
under
101,
section
either
48
or
54
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
condition
is,
is
that
it
will
be
presented
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
and
that
upon
presentment
it
will
be
honored.
then
it
relates
back
to
the
date
of
delivery.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
only
in
the
instance
where
the
post-dating
of
the
check
exceeds
30
days.
that's
when
it
becomes
a
cash
transaction...
correction.
if
the
post-dating
of
the
check
is
within
30
days,
the
condition...
and
it
is
presented
within
30
days,
it
is
a...
the
condition
is
removed
and
it
goes
back
to
the
date
of
delivery.
if
the
presentment
is
made
in...
in
31
days
or
in
excess
of
31
days,
then
the
delivery
date
is
of
no
force
and
effect
because
we're
beyond
the
30-day
reasonable
time.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
would...
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
in
that
instance
the
date
of
the
check
is
the
critical
date.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
justice
stevens,
whichever
is
later.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
the
way
our
commercial
system
is
devised,
until
the
date
on
the
check
arrives
one
has
no
claim
to
the
funds
that
underlie
the
validity
of
that
check,
and
therefore
the
date
on
the
check,
if
it
is
beyond
the
date
of
delivery,
must
control...
must
control.
547(b)
is...
as
i
say,
it
doesn't
define
a
date
of
delivery
or
a
date
of
honor
rule
for
us,
and
in
fact
to
the
extent
that
we
can
look
solely
to
547(b)
to
tell
us
whether
date
of
delivery
or
date
of
honor
rules
should
apply,
it
doesn't
do
that.
however,
we
know
that
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
is
a
great
statutory
scheme,
and
we
can
look
within
the
code
when
sections
of
the
code
do
not
provide
us
with
a
clear-cut
answer.
section
101(48)
and
(54)
defines
what
a
transfer
is,
and
i
think
that
is
where
we
have
to
begin.
it
in
fact
shows
that
a
transfer
is
any
mode
of
transaction
or
a
transaction
of
transfer
whether
it
is
absolute,
whether
it
is
conditional...
it
is
a
very
broad
definition.
a
check
is
certainly
a
conditional
conveyance.
it
is
a
conditional
transfer.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
the
definition
under
101(48)
says
the
transfer
of
an
interest
of
a
debtor
in
property,
as
opposed
to
the
transfer
of
interest
to
property.
the
interest
that's
being
transferred
between
the
debtor
and
the
creditor...
and
those
terms
only
apply
if
the
payor
on
the
check
subsequently
files
for
bankruptcy...
is
that
the
payor
on
the
check
is
representing
by
giving
this
check
on
the
date
on
the
check
that
there
are
sufficient
funds
in
his
account
to
cover
that
check.
there
is
an
underlying
principle
of
good
faith
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
is
specifically
applicable
to
this
case
that
i
as
payor
of
the
check
am
representing
that
those
funds
are
in
my
bank.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
we
are
not
talking
about
an
assignment
of
the
funds,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
well,
the
transfer
of
the--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--he
may
stop
payment
on
the
check,
but
i
believe
that
once
the
check
is
delivered,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
white,
and
if
i
can
answer
justice
scalia's
question
and
consolidate
my
answer
here,
is
that
when
a
check
is
transferred
that
is
the
end
of
a
transaction,
a
previous
transaction,
a
transaction
where
you
have
a
vendor
or
a
vendee.
goods
or
services
are
delivered.
those
goods
and
services
are
then
paid
for
by
a
check.
in
the
commercial
world,
when
a
check
is
delivered
that
transaction
is
terminated.
that's
the
end
of
that
transaction.
once
the
check
is
given,
it
is--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--if
the...
but
it
is
a
conditional
transfer,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
covered
under
101(54).
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
the
conditional
portion,
justice
kennedy,
with
all
due
respect
is
the
check.
the
vendor-vendee
transaction
has
in
fact
terminated.
that
is
the
termination.
if,
as
justice
white
has
suggested...
if
a
stop
payment
order
is
issued
on
the
check
prior
to
it
being
honored,
then
the
condition
of
the
transfer
has
not
been
met.
there
is
no
way
for
the
check
to
be
honored,
and
therefore
you
have
no
date
problem
because
you
don't
revert
back
to
the
date
of
delivery.
there
is
no
honoring.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
it
transferred
an
interest
in
property--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--in
the
property
that
is
represented
by
the
cash
in
the
bank.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
it
transfer...
it
conditionally
transfers
it
upon
honoring,
but
it
relates
back
to
the
date
of
delivery,
justice
stevens.
if
in
fact
there's
a
dishonoring
of
the
check
for
some
reason,
that
is
a
separate
cause
of
action.
uniform
commercial
code
section
3122
tells
us
that
in
fact
as
of
the
date
of
the
check,
that
is
submitted,
the
cause...
a
new
cause
of
action
arises
for
the
vendor
on
the
check
itself,
and
i
believe
that
there's
a
separate
question
there.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
in
fact
the
uniform
commercial
code
under
article
3802
tells
us
that
the
receiver
of
the
check,
the
payee
on
the
check,
has
his
option.
he
may
proceed
under
the
underlying
agreement,
or
he
may
proceed
on
the
check.
he
may
elect
his
remedy,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
no,
justice
scalia,
there's
nothing
in
the
ucc
that
prohibits
that.
in
essence--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
correct.
the
interest
in
property
can
be
the
chose
in
action.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
correct.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
justice
white,
you're
correct,
the
bank
is
in
trouble...
if
it
wrongfully
fails
to
honor
it
the
bank
is
in
trouble
with
the
drawer.
i
think
the
perception,
justice
white--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--not
with
the
drawee,
no,
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
he
cannot
for
wrongfully
dishonoring.
the
payor
is
the
only
one
who
has
the
right
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
to--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--because
of
the
relation
back
doctrine.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
if
the
bank--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--justice
white,
if
the
bank
wrongfully
dishonors
the
check
i
believe
that
in
fact
the
payor
on
the
check
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
bank
as
well.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
the
payee
does
not
have--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--that's
correct--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--there's
a
transfer
of
an
interest
in
property,
a
conditional
transfer.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
the
payee's
interest
is,
by
not--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--yes,
justice
white.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case,
justice
white,
because
the
transaction...
it's
a
three-party
transaction.
the
emphasis
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
we
must
remember
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
is
the
bankruptcy
code,
is
the
relationship
between
the
payor
and
the
payee,
or
the
drawer
and
the
drawee
on
the
check.
that's
who
we're
interested
in,
and
we're
interested
in
tolling
a
time
of
when
this
transfer
takes
effect,
and
commercial
business
practice
just
doesn't
take
place
that
way.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
we
give
a
check--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--there
is
a
drawee
bank.
the
drawee...
you
have
the
payor.
that's
the
person
who
signs
the
check.
you
have
the
payee,
that's
who
the
check's
made
out
to.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
the
transfer
of
interest
was
not
the
payor's
actions
against
the
bank
itself
for
wrongful
dishonor
of
the
check.
that
wasn't
the
transfer.
the
transfer
was
of
the
liability
that
the
bank
owes
to
the
payor.
the
payor
transferred
his
liability,
or
the
bank's
liability
to
him
to
the
payee.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
because
he--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--because,
justice
white,
it
is
not
an
assignment.
it
is
not
an
assignment
in
the
classic
sense.
it
is
a
conditional
transfer.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
justice
scalia,
that
is
correct--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--at
547(e),
justice
scalia,
is
where
the
bankruptcy
code
directs
its
attention
to
perfection.
it
has
largely
been
held
by
most
courts
that
that
section
applies
solely
to
real
property
interest
in
mortgages
and
the
relation-back
doctrine
is
clearly
stated
in
547(a)
to
(b).
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
547(c)
adopts
that,
justice
kennedy,
that's
correct,
and
for
the
purposes
of
(c)(1)
and
(c)(2)
this
furthers...
we
want
to
have
a
substantially
contemporaneous
exchange
or
a
cash
transaction
represented
by
a
check
because
the
purpose
of
547(c),
the
exceptions
to
547(b),
is
to
promote
vendors
doing
business
with
a
debtor
or
a
vendee
who's
sliding
into
bankruptcy.
we
don't
want
to
have
a
chilling
effect
on
having
nobody
do
business
with
this
individual.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
that
is
certainly
the
position
of
the
trustee
in
this
case,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
to
serve
the
purpose
of
the
uniformity
of
the
law
as
espoused
in
mckenzie
v.
irving
trust,
that
in
fact
it
makes
no
sense
and
it
is
illogical
to
have
two
different
dates
apply
within
the
same
section
or
subsection
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--mr.
chief
justice,
if
in
fact
the
date
of
honor
rule
were
to
satisfy
an
equality
of
distribution
among
creditors,
which
in
fact
547(b)
is
designed
to
do,
then
i
could
not
quarrel
with
you.
however,
i
can
show
this
court
by
a
hypothetical
example
that
a
date
of
honor
rule
does
not
treat
creditors
equally.
if
we
will
assume
for
a
moment
that
a
check
is
delivered
to
two
creditors
dated
on
the
same
day
which
is
outside
the
preference
window,
one
of
the
creditors
is
an
in-state
or
even
an
in-town
creditor,
the
other
is
out-of-state.
the
in-state
creditor
receives
the
check
on
a
given
date
outside
the
preference
period,
deposits
it
the
next
day
as
in
this
case,
and
the
check
is
honored
on
that
day.
the
date
of
honoring
in
that
instance
is
clearly
outside
the
preference
period.
however,
the
out-of-state
creditor,
by
virtue
of
his
location,
is
not
quite
as
fortunate.
he
must
take
that
check,
deposit
it
in
his
bank,
usually
wait
a
3-to
10-day
clearing
period
on
the
check
before
it's
then
presented
to
the
in-state
bank.
if
during
that
period
of
time
subsequent
thereto
that
period
of
honoring
of
the
out-of-state
check
falls
within
the
preferential
transfer
period,
we
have
not
satisfied
through
the
date
of
honor
rule
one
of
the
stated
policies
of
547(b).
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
think
if
they're
trade
creditors
both
based
on
antecedent
debts,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
are
similarly
situated
creditors.
they
are
of
equal
priority.
if
we
assume,
and
we
must
assume
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
and
the
hypothetical,
that
they
are
of
the
same
class...
that
is,
they
will
be
treated
as
in
the
same
class
under
1129
for
the
purposes
of
a
plan,
which
is
what
we
are
attempting
to
resolve,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
fact
they
are
between
the
treatment
of
two
creditors
of
equal
priority,
just
because
one
happens
to
be
located
out
of
the
state,
or
out
of
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
transaction
took
place.
if
there
are
no
further--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
date
of
delivery
is
the
date
that
satisfies
all
three
of
the
public
policy--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--i
believe
that
the
person
to
whom
the
check
is
delivered
is
faced
with
an
election
of
remedies,
justice
white,
where
he
may
either
sue
on
the
check
or
sue
on
the
transaction.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
he
may
sue
on
the
check,
justice
white,
or
he
may
sue
on
the
transaction
at
his
option.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
his
cause
of
action
on
the
check
would
be
against
the
payor
on
the
check
probably
for
fraud.
in
other
words,
you
delivered
this
check
to
me
and
you
represented
it
to
me
that
you
had
funds
sufficient
to
cover
this,
and
that--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
it
would
be
an
action
for
civil
fraud.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
he
warrants...
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
justice
white's--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--it--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--under
the
facts
that
were
presented
by
justice
white,
if
you
write
a
check
one
day
and
withdraw
all
the
funds
the
next
day
before
that
check
has
had
a
chance
to
clear,
you
may
have
sufficient
grounds
for
fraud.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that,
but--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--it's
a
conditional
transfer,
yes,
it
is,
justice
white.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
take
the
2
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
i
might.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
yes,
justice.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
my
position
is
that
because
the
nature
of
a
check
is
that
it
is
a
conditional
transfer,
and
that
it
is
recognized
within
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
in
the
bankruptcy
courts.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
because
the
concept
of
how
commerce
works
and
how
banks
honor
checks
does
not
permit
it.
if
we
have
a
dishonor
of
a
check
within
the
preference
period
subsequent
to
delivery,
you
don't
have
a
preference
action,
there's
no
question
of
that,
because
there's
nothing...
nothing
has
changed
hands.
it
is
the
conditional
nature,
however,
of
giving
of
a
check
and
its
relation
back
to
the
date
of
delivery
that
puts
it
in
a
unique
circumstance.
it's
much
like
the
547(e)
provision,
and
the
honoring
of
the
check
you
can
analogize,
as
we
have
in
our
brief,
to
the
perfection
of
a
security
interest
in
either
personal
property
or
real
property.
there
is
a
definite
relation
back
doctrine
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
the
definition
of
property
under
541
would
cover
a
conveyance
by
check.
the
property
itself
would
be
that
chose
in
action.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
i
do
not
believe
it
unenforceable.
i
believe
that
the
check--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--you
can
present
it
to
the
bank
for
honoring.
if
it
is
wrongfully
dishonored...
and
that
would
be
the
only
reason
it
would
be
dishonored,
in
which
the
payee
would
have
a
cause
of
action
or
would
want
to
enforce
it
against
the
bank
if
the
bank
wrongfully
dishonored
it.
that's
the
only
reason--
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
--the
payee
can...
if
it's
wrongfully
dishonored,
he
cannot,
but
what
he
can
do
is
he
may
sue
the
payor.
the
payor
may
then
sue
the
drawee
bank
for
wrongfully
dishonoring
the
check.
mr.
william
j.
arland,
iii
but
it
does
affect
the
transfer,
justice
souter,
with
all
due
respect,
if
one
looks
to
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
the
bankruptcy
code
under
section
101(54)
provides
for
conditional
transfer.
the
conditional
transfer
is
a
transfer
in
and
of
itself.
the
fact
that
the
presentment
of
the
check
occurs
within
the
period
does
not
affect
the
date
of
transfer,
which
is
the
date
of
delivery
itself.
