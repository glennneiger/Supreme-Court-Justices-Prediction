justice
souter
you
would
agree
that
if
the
payee
could
enforce
it
against
the
bank,
if
the
bank
dishonors
it,
then
your
position
would
be
different.
justice
souter
yes,
but
that
just
means
that
it's
conditional,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
prove
anything
more
than
that
the
transfer
is
conditional.
justice
souter
well,
but
for
that
proposition
you
rely,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
position
that
the
payee
cannot
enforce
it
against
the
bank.
justice
souter
mr.
arland,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
souter
why
isn't
your
position
that
there's
a
conditional
transfer
here
defeated
by
the
fact
that
the
payee
cannot
enforce
that
transfer
against
the
bank
if
it's
dishonored?
justice
souter
then
why
can't
it
be
enforced
against
the
bank?
justice
souter
but
isn't...
you
say
it's
a
relation
back,
but
doesn't
the
relation
back
occur
only
because
the
check
is
an
authorization
to
pay,
and
if
the
person
authorized
accepts
the
authorization
then
the
payment
subject
to
conditions
you've
mentioned
relates
back,
but
it
is
not
a
chose
in
action
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
enforced
against
the
bank
as
the
holder
of
funds.
justice
souter
a
nonenforceable
authorization
to
a
third
party?
justice
souter
a
nonenforceable
authorization
to
a
third
party
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
property?
justice
souter
well,
you
can't
enforce
it
against
the
bank.
that's
what's
holding
me
up.
justice
souter
if
it's
wrongfully
dishonored,
can
it
sue
the
bank?
i
thought
you
conceded
that
it
could
not.
justice
souter
well,
that's
great,
but
it
doesn't
affect
the
transfer.
you
simply
go
back
to
your
original--
