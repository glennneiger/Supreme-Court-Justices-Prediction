justice
o'connor
would
the
same
be
true
if
a
check
were
given
as
sort
of
a
security
deposit
not
to
be
cashed
until
certain
events
occurred,
or
unless
certain
events
occurred?
justice
o'connor
it
would
be
what?
justice
o'connor
ms.
cusack,
do
you
take
the
position
that
under
new
mexico
law
when
the
check
is
delivered
that
it
does
not
at
least
conditionally
transfer
a
chose
in
action
to
the
payee?
justice
o'connor
would
new
mexico
recognize
that
it
conditionally
transfers
a
chose
in
action
to
the
payee
when
the
check
is
delivered?
justice
o'connor
is
new
mexico's
law
substantially
different
from
that
of
most
other
states--
justice
o'connor
and
when
you
look
at
the
definition
in
the
bankruptcy
code
101
of
what
a
transfer
means,
it
means
every
mode,
absolute
or
conditional...
or
conditional...
of
disposing
or
parting
with
property
or
with
an
interest
in
property.
do
you
say
that
the
delivery
of
a
check
does
not
meet
that
definition?
justice
o'connor
under
101.
