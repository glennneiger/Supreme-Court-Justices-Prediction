justice
scalia
are
you
sure
that
the
ucc
considers
it
not
to
come
within
that
rule
if
it's
cashed
within
30
days
of
its
date
but
beyond
30
days
after
the
actual
delivery
of
it?
you
say
that
the--
justice
scalia
--30
days
from
the
date...
the
date
on
the
check.
justice
scalia
right,
that's
what
i
understand.
justice
scalia
right,
but
it
doesn't
matter
for
that
purpose
when
the
check
is
actually
handed
over.
if
i
give
you
a
check
now
that's
dated
30
days
from
now,
that
becomes
a
cash
transaction
30
days
from
now,
does
it
not?
justice
scalia
if
you
post-date
the
check
there
are
two
conditions.
one
is
that
the
later
date
come
about,
and
the
second
is
that
it
be
presented,
and
it
becomes
a
cash
transaction
when
the
first
condition
is
met,
and
then
still
subject
to
the
subsequent
presentation.
justice
scalia
what
is
conveyed?
the
principal
point
your
opponent
makes
is
it
has
to
be
transfer
of
property
of
the
debtor.
what
property
of
the
debtor
is
being
transferred?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
this
a
conditional
transfer
of
a
chose
in
action?
is
there
anything
in
the
ucc
that
prohibits
that?
justice
scalia
the
person
who
has
money
in
the
bank
has
a
cause
of
action
against
the
bank
for
the
amount
of
that
deposit,
right?
justice
scalia
and
he
can
assign
to
another
person
outright
or
conditionally
part
of
his
claim
against
the
bank.
it's
not
binding
upon
the
bank,
but
as
between
the
two
of
them
it's
binding.
justice
scalia
so
it's
a
chose
in
action
that's
been
transferred.
justice
scalia
so
we
know
what
we're
talking
about,
isn't
the
drawee
the
bank?
i
always
thought
the
bank
was--
justice
scalia
--the
bank
is
the
drawee
bank,
right?
that's
right.
justice
scalia
and
the
payor
is
also
the
drawer.
justice
scalia
on
the
drawee.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
perfected
yet,
and
the
bankruptcy
code
anticipates
that
some
of
these
things
could
be
perfected
later.
it
becomes
perfected
when
the
bank
gets
the
check
and
honors
it,
and
before
then
it's
good
as
between
the
payor
and
the
payee,
but
it's
not
binding
on
the
bank
and
the
liability
is
between
those
two.
justice
scalia
and
that's
why
the
bankruptcy
code
talks
about
perfection.
justice
scalia
you
have
to
have
knowledge
for
fraud.
you
don't
want
to
make
people
have
to
prove
that
the
other
person
knew
he
had
no
money
in
the
bank.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
effective?
when
is
a
currently
dated
check
deemed
effective?
justice
scalia
on
the
date
of
honor,
of
course--
justice
scalia
--yes.
you're
not
saying
anything
as
far
as
the
difference
between
post-dated
and
currently
dated
is
concerned.
your
position
is
that
the
check
has
no
effect
until
it's
honored.
isn't
there
an
assignment
of
the
chose
in
action,
though?
when
i
write
a
check,
am
i
not
saying...
am
i
not
saying
to
the
person
that
i
give
the
check,
you
are
entitled
to
my
cause
of
action
against
the
bank?
isn't
that
what
the
whole
thing
is?
justice
scalia
well,
for
the
transfer
to
be
perfected
that
has
to
happen,
and
that's
why
the
code
in
a
later
section
says
what
the
rules
are
for
perfection,
and
that
occurred
within
the
requisite
period
here,
the
honor.
justice
scalia
mrs.
cusack,
what
do
you
make
of
subsection
(e)(1),
which
is
on
page
33a
of
the
petition...
i'm
sorry,
(e)(2),
which
seems
to
make
a
distinction
between
two
types
of
transfer,
just
a
transfer
plain
and
simple
and
a
perfected
transfer.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
assumes
that
there's
no
transfer
unless
it's
a
perfected
transfer,
but
(e)(2)
says
for
purposes
of
this
section
a
transfer
is
made
at
the
time...
a,
at
the
time
it
takes
effect
between
the
transferor
and
the
transferee
if
it
is
perfected
at
or
within
10
days
after
such
time.
now,
it
seems
to
me
it's...
that
is
meant
to
cover
exactly
this
situation.
if
i
gave
you
the
money
right
now,
that's
a
completed
transfer...
it's
perfected.
what
does
it
mean
to
have
a
transfer
which
takes
effect
between
the
transferor
and
the
transferee
but
is
not
yet
perfected?
what
does
that
cover,
if
it
doesn't
cover
this?
justice
scalia
i
think
your
mistake
is
to
say
that
this
is
a
transfer
of
money.
it's
not
a
transfer
of
money,
it's
a
transfer
of
a
chose
in
action,
which
is
property.
it's
a
transfer
of
a
claim
for
money.
justice
scalia
mrs.
cusack,
you're
not
seeking
money
any
more
than
the
payee
of
the
check
is
seeking
money.
you
are
not
seeking
some
particular
dollar
bills
that
the
bankrupt
owns.
you
are
seeking
to
assert
a
chose
of
action
against
the
bank
on
behalf
of
the
trustee.
justice
scalia
you
say
that
the
bank
owes
the
estate
money,
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
paid
to
him
by
whom?
justice
scalia
no,
but
to
the
extent
you
say
that
money
that
the
bank
gave
to
the
petitioner
here
should
have
been
given
to
the
trustee,
or
should
have
remained
in
the
estate,
you're
asserting
a
chose
in
action.
you're
not
asserting
a
claim
for
particular
property.
justice
scalia
against
the
bank,
for
any
money
that
the
bank
has,
not
any
particular
money.
there's
no
segregated
fund
for
your
client
in
the
bank...
this
is
his
money.
you're
just
asserting
a
claim
against
the
bank.
