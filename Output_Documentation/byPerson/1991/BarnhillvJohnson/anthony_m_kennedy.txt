justice
kennedy
but
a
representation
by
the
payor
is
not
a
transfer
of
an
interest,
it's
just
a
representation,
and
in
fact
ucc
says,
as
i
understand
it...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
the
check
does
not
operate
as
an
assignment
of
the
funds.
justice
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
what
interest
in
property
is
transferred,
and
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
was
that
there
is
a
representation
made
that
funds
are
in
the
bank,
but
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
a
transfer
of
any
property.
justice
kennedy
not
if
the
check
isn't
honored.
justice
kennedy
well,
then
it
seems
rather
odd
to
say
the
transaction
is
ended
but
it's
conditional.
justice
kennedy
well,
547
also
talks
about
a
substantially
contemporaneous
transfer,
which
i
take
it
at
least
can
be
interpreted
as
the
attempt
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
accommodate
this
delay
between
the
time
the
check
is
given
and
the
time
that
it
is
honored,
and
that
language
has
the
effect
of
showing
that
even
if
you
wait
till
the
time
that
it's
honored
it's
substantially
contemporaneous.
justice
kennedy
are
you
aware
of
any
states
where
the
result
would
be
different
than
it
is
under
new
mexico
law
according
to
your
view
of
the
case?
