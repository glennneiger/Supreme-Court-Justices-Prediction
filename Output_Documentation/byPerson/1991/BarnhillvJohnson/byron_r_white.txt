justice
white
the
question
here
is
if
he
can
stop
payment
on
the
check.
justice
white
so
if
the
bank
chose
to
honor
it,
it's
in
trouble
with
the
drawer.
justice
white
but
not
with
the
drawee.
justice
white
so
how
come
if
it's
a
transfer,
why
isn't
the
bank
in
trouble
with
the
drawee?
he's
got
some
right
in
that
account.
why
can't
he
sue
the
bank?
justice
white
well,
why
can
you
ever
say
it
was
a
transfer
to
him,
conditional
or
otherwise?
justice
white
i
mean,
what
happened
to
his
interest
in
the
property
that
you
say
was
transferred?
what
happens
to
it
when
the
bank
dishonors...
wrongfully
dishonors
the
check?
justice
white
it
disappears
into
thin
air.
justice
white
why,
sure,
but
not
the
payee.
justice
white
but
you
say
that
there
was
a
transfer
to
the
payee--
justice
white
--at
the
time
of
delivery
of
the
check.
justice
white
well,
what
happened
to
his
interest?
justice
white
i
mean
the
drawee...
the
drawee.
there
was
a
delivery
of
a
check
to
the
drawee,
is
that
it?
justice
white
and
you
say
that
was
a
transfer.
justice
white
a
conditional
transfer.
justice
white
but
then
you
would
think
that
he
had
an
interest
in
the
property
that
he
should
be
able
to
vindicate
against
the
bank
if
the
bank
wrongfully
dishonors
the
check.
justice
white
i'm
talking
about
the
fellow
to
whom
the
check
was
delivered.
you
say
there
was
a
transfer
to
him--
justice
white
--at
that
time.
justice
white
and
yet
he
cannot
vindicate
that
interest
that
was
transferred
to
him,
you
say,
by
a
suit
against
the
bank.
justice
white
well
then,
why
can't
the
payee
sue
the
bank,
then?
justice
white
he's
had
something
transferred
to
him.
justice
white
and
you
can
answer
this
question
in
a
word,
i
think.
suppose
the
fellow
who
writes
the
check
and
delivers
it
promptly
then
writes...
goes
to
the
bank
and
withdraws
his
account
so
that
the
check
cannot
possibly
be
honored.
does
the
person
to
whom
the
check
is
delivered
then
sue
on
the
check
or
on
the
original
debt?
justice
white
may
he
sue
on
the
check?
justice
white
what
would
be
his
cause
of
action
on
the
check,
that
there
was
an
assignment,
or
what?
justice
white
is
this
an
action
for
fraud,
or
what?
justice
white
what
is
this,
an
action
for
fraud?
justice
white
i'm
just
really
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
say
well,
this
shows
there
must
have
been
a
transfer
if
you
can
sue
on
the
check.
justice
white
for
purposes
of
this
case
it's
irrelevant
that
it
was
post-dated.
justice
white
well,
the
check
became
a
cash
transaction
the
next
day,
which
was
before
the
90th
day.
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
is
that
the...
that
is
the
unmistakable
law
of
new
mexico?
justice
white
counsel,
you
really
were
suggesting
that
the
word
transfer
as
used
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
which
is
defined
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
is
controlled
by
state
law.
i
thought
that
would
be
a
federal
question.
it
may
be
that
you
might
be
persuaded
that...
you
look
around
for
probably
any
evidence
of
what
it
means,
but
you
don't
really
think
this
is
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
white
the
word
transfer
in
all
the--
justice
white
--of
course,
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
is
it?
justice
white
i
know
it
referred
to
it,
but
it
didn't
for
a
minute
suggest
that
a
transfer
is...
only
takes
place
when
state
law
says
it
does.
justice
white
and
it
thought
the...
it
thought
that
its
holding
was
consistent
with
the
uniform
commercial
code.
justice
white
as
adopted
in
new
mexico.
