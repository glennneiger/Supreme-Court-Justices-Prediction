chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
91-159,
william
barnhill
v.
elliot
johnson.
mr.
arland,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
your
response
to
justice
blackmun...
is
it
based
partly
on
547(c)
as
well
as
547(b)?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
your
answer
based
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
hypothesis
of
a
1-month
post-dating
would
have
brought
the
date
written
on
the
check
within
the
preference
period?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
it
be
more
accurate
to
describe
the
transaction
that
way,
rather
than
as
a
transfer
of
property?
the
check
gives
the
vendor,
the
drawee
of
the
check,
a
different
cause
of
action
against
the
drawer.
he
now
has
a
cause
of
action
on
the
check
and
not
just
on
the
open
account.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
547(c)
deals
with
the
normal
course
of
business,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
how
you
would
treat
a
check
under
the
normal
course
of
business
section
might
not
be
determined,
i
would
think,
for
547(b)
purposes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you're
talking
about
two
different
purposes,
one
is
to
determine
was
this
the
kind
of
transaction
you
would
expect
in
the
normal
course
of
business?
if
a
person
is
paid
by
check
presently
dated
for
10
years
and
continues
to
do
that,
it's
the
normal
course
of
business,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
would
be
illogical
to
say
a
somewhat
different
test
might
apply
in
determining
whether
there's
a
transfer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
when
you
talk
about
treating
creditors
equally
you
mean
treating
similarly
situated
creditors
equally,
and
on
the
facts
you
give
i
think
a
very
good
argument
can
be
made
those
creditors
are
not
similarly
situated.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
payor
warrants
that
the
check
will
be
paid,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
don't
need
an
action
for
fraud,
it's
an
action
on
the
warranty
that's
implied
by
the
drawing
of
a
check.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
arland.
ms.
cusack,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
a
minute
ago,
mrs.
cusack,
you
told
justice
white
that
that
was
a
matter
of
state
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
if
it's
not
answered
by
the
federal
statutory
provision.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
don't
you
also
rely
on
the
proposition
that
the
payor
may
stop
payment
or
may
also
withdraw
his
funds
before
the
check
clears?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
cusack.
mr.
arland,
do
you
have
anything
in
rebuttal?
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
arland.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
third
case
is
no.
91-159,
barnhill
versus
johnson
and
it
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
involves
a
rather
technical
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
allows
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
set
aside
transfers
of
property
made
by
a
debtor
within
a
certain
time
before
the
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy.
it
is
designed
to
prevent
debtors
who
are
facing
bankruptcy
from
making
last
minute
payments
to
favored
creditors
or
friends.
but
what
the
case
boils
down
to
is
the
determination
of
the
consequences
of
a
transaction
in
which
millions
of
adults
regularly
engage
in
without
any
thought
of
bankruptcy.
the
payment
of
a
debt
by
check
delivered
to
the
debtor.
does
the
actual
legal
transfer
of
the
funds
occur
when
the
check
is
delivered
to
the
debtor
or
when
he
debtor
cashes
it
at
the
bank
on
which
the
check
is
drawn?
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
was
the
latter.
we
agree
and
affirm
its
judgment.
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
which
is
the
law
in
almost
every
state,
the
mere
receipt
of
the
check
by
the
creditor
does
not
give
the
creditor
a
right
to
sue
the
bank
if
the
bank
should
decline
to
honor
the
check.
a
bank
remains
free
to
refuse
to
honor
the
check
because
of
insufficient
funds,
because
a
third
party
has
garnished
the
debtor's
account
or
even
if
the
debtor
closes
the
account
with
the
result
that
the
check
bounces.
it
is
only
when
the
check
is
honored
by
the
bank
that
the
creditor
either
has
the
funds
in
hand
or
has
the
right
to
sue
the
bank
if
it
subsequently
refuses
to
pay.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
the
trustee
in
this
case
may
set
aside
the
transfer
because
the
creditor
did
not
cash
the
check
until
after
the
cut
off
date
although
he
received
it
before
hand.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
joins.
