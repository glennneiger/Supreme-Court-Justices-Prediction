h.

well,
you
can
tell
something,
can't
you?
can't
you
say
that
those
people
have
the
greatest
percentage...
as
a
general
rule,
those
people
have
the
greatest
percentage
of
their
wealth--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
unrealized
value,
and
isn't
it
rational
for
the
state
to
say
that
as
a
general
premise
of
the
taxing
scheme,
people
with
a
large
percentage
of
wealth
in
unrealized
value
are
less
able
to
keep
up
with
uniform
current
tax
paces...
tax
rates
than
people
with
a
comparatively
small
percentage
in
unrealized
value?
that's
rational,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
the
people
in
the
middle?
i
assume
there
is
some
kind
of
middle
ground
between
the
bungalows
and
the
mansions,
and
just
taking
them
as
kind
of
a
standard
to
start
with,
can
you
not
say
that
in
fact
it
is
a
rational
premise
to
say
that
the
greater
the
percentage
of
wealth
in
unrealized
value,
the
less
the
capacity
to
keep
up
with
an
otherwise
even
and
uniform
tax
rate?
based
on
fair
market
value.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sure
that's
probably
true,
but
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
answer
to
my
question?
isn't
it
still
a
rational
basis
for
the
system
to
make
the
assumption
that
i
just
expressed?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
ask
you
about
beverly
hills
mansions.
i
asked
you
for
kind
of
the
person
in
the
middle,
somewhere
between
the
mansion
and
the
bungalow.
maybe
we're
trying
to
find
a
standard
taxpayer
here,
at
least
as
a
peg
to
judge
rationality.
and
with
respect
to
that
standard
taxpayer,
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
the
more
wealth
is
unrealized,
the
less
capacity
to
pay
out
money?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
a
pretty
good
bet
that
if
i
can
spend
the
higher
amount
of
money,
admitting
that
i
will
borrow
some,
but
with
the
capacity
to
borrow
some,
isn't
it
a
pretty
good
bet
that
i
probably
have
a
capacity
to
raise
more
cash
on
an
annual
basis,
and
that
i
probably
have
an
income
sufficient
to
support
a
higher
cash
payment?
isn't
there...
isn't
it
rational
to
assume
there's
a
correlation
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
the
state
is
wrong
in
assuming
that
the
older
home
owner
should
not
constantly
increase
mortgage
debt
in
order
to
pay
taxes?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
effect
of
the
runaway
assessor
was
that,
taking
justice
scalia's
hypothesis,
that
in
west
virginia,
as
it
were,
some
young
taxpayers,
to
use
his
term,
were
subsidizing
the
old
taxpayers
and
other
young
taxpayers
weren't.
that's
why
there
was
no
systemic
fairness.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
mr.
lee,
you've
argued
that
this
is
an
acquisition-based
value
tax.
and
that
does
not
at
all
fit
with
able
to
give
commercial
property
to
your
children.
it
does
not
all
fit
with
a
downward
adjustment
which
is
unlimited,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
respond
to
that
because
the
supposition
here,
the
charge,
is
that
there's
a
favored
group
and
you
attacked
that
in
the
very
opening
part
of
your
submission
to
us.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hodge-podge
created
by
these
exemptions
strongly
undercuts
the
acquisition
value
theory
that
you
advance
for
this
tax.
