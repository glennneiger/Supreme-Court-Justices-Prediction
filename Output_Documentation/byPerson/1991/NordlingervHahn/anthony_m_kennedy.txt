would
it
be
rational
for
a
state
to
conclude,
given
the
pattern
of
our
economy
in
the
last
few
generations,
that
there
is
a
constant
inflation,
and
that
this
means
that
the
longer
you've
held
your
home,
the
more
unrealized
value
you
have
in
the
home?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
rational
for
the
state
to
make
that
judgment
as
an
economic
matter,
that
this
is
what
happens:
the
longer
you
have
your
home,
the
more
unrealized
value
you
have
in
that
home?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
it
is
irrational?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
rational.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they
have
less
unrealized
value.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
your
equal
protection
principle
is.
is
it
your
submission
that
there's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
if
the
state
official
does
not
enforce
the
state
law
as
written?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr....
no,
but
the
hypothetical
put
to
you
by
justice
scalia
and
i
think
echoed
by
justice
souter
and
the
one
i'm
interested
in,
is
what
happens
if
the
official
refuses
to
enforce
the
state
policy
as
written?
is
that
a
violation
of
equal
protection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
the
best
authority
you
have
for
that
proposition,
other
than
allegheny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
far
more
vast
expansion
of
equal
protection
jurisprudence
than
the
petitioner's
submission
here,
which
is
that
equal
property
tax...
that
property
tax
should
be
treated
equally
for
similarly
situated
persons.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
much
less
sweeping
equal
protection
analysis.
