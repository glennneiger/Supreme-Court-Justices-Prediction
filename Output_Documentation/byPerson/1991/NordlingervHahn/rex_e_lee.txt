mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
equal
protection
analysis
of
this
case
is
just
as
simple
as
it
is
compelling.
there
is
no
justified
classification;
there
is
no
fundamental
right.
so
the
question
is
not
whether
california
could
have
done
it
done
it
some
other
better
way,
or
whether
the
way
that
it
chose
is
even
good
policy.
the
only
question
is
whether
california's
acquisition
value
assessment
system
furthers
some
legitimate
state
purpose,
and
clearly
it
does,
for
reasons
that
have
already
been
identified
by
justice
o'connor
and
other
members
of
the
court.
this
was
a
very
serious
problem
with
which
california
was
dealing.
people
had
remarkable
increases
in
their
balance
sheet,
but
they
didn't
have
the
corresponding
money
to
pay
the
corresponding
increases
in
taxes.
over
a
period
of
10
years,
prior
to
1978,
the
legislature
tried
no
fewer
than
19
times
to
deal
with
the
problem,
but
none
was
really
effective
because
none
attacked
the
problem
at
its
core,
which
was
a
combination
of
unusually
escalating
real
estate
prices
in
the
state
of
california,
in
the
1960's
and
1970's,
coupled
with
a
current
value
assessment
property
tax
scheme.
california
voters
adopted
a
four-part
response,
and
the
part
that's
at
issue
here
is
the
one
that
simply
says,
for
the
first
time
in
history,
so
far
as
i
know...
and
california
is
the
only
state
that's
done
it...
in
response
to
a
correspondingly
serious
problem
we
are
just
going
to
unhitch
our
properties
tax
assessment
from
current
value,
and
instead
we
are
going
to
tie
it,
basically,
to
an
acquisition
value
basis.
key
to
the
analysis
of
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
california
courts...
mr.
hall,
to
my
astonishment,
purports
to
have
found
what
the
true
basis
of
this
proposition
13
really
was,
and
he
said
that
the
jarvis
and
gan
groups
have
themselves
identified,
that
they
have
just
found
a
way
that
they
could
tie
this,
that
they
could
shift
their...
tax
to
someone
else.
that
is
not
the
purpose.
i
invite
the
court
to
read
the
pages
of
the
gan
jarvis
briefs
to
which
he
cites,
and
they
don't
say
that
at
all.
but
in
any
event,
fortunately
what
we
do
have
is
a
statement
by
the
california
supreme
court
of
the
three
purposes,
perfectly
legitimate
purposes,
for
proposition
13.
the
first
one
is,
to
prevent
the
taxation
of
unrealized
appreciation
in
the
value
of
property,
and
of
course,
that
basically
got
at
the
problem.
and
the
second
is
provide
for
certainty
in
the
amount
of
taxes
that
a
person
was
going
to
have
to
pay
by
tying
the
amount
of
the
taxes,
basically,
to
the
amount
that
that
person
was
willing
to
pay
at
the
time
that
he
or
she
bought
the
property.
you
know,
the
problem
that
they
were
dealing
with
was
that
the
property
owners
had
no
control.
that's
why
they
were
losing
their
homes.
they
had
no
way
to
control
what
the
future
increase
in
property
taxes
is,
but--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
would
have
been
another
solution,
but
the
one
they
chose
was
this
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
justice
stevens,
if
the
new
test
is
does
it
place
a
different
burden
on
some
other
people,
then
the
equal
protection
clause
is
going
to
cut
a
swath
through
our
federal
and
state
taxation
laws.
it's
going
to
make
sherman's
march
through
georgia
look
like
a
sunday
picnic.
because
those
kinds
of
anomalies
abound...
abound...
throughout
our
tax
laws.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
but
you
look
at...
there
are
anomalies,
there
are
inequities,
there
are
windfalls
throughout
the
federal
income
tax
code,
and
necessarily
so.
and
that's
why
for
a
century
and
a
quarter,
the
rule
has
been
that
unless
it
really
is
invidious
and
unless
there
is
no
conceivable...
this
is
where
the
no
conceivable
approach
to
rational
basis
really
had
its
beginning.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
this
reason--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yeah.
and
i'm
not
going
to
be
presumptuous
enough
to
tell
you
what
the
underlying
basis
for
the...
but
i
do
have
my
own
idea.
take
it
in
two
steps.
you
start
from
the
premise,
of
course,
that
what
you
have
to
do
first
of
all
is
identify
what
is
the
state's
end,
what
is
its
objective.
and
then
you
ask,
is
there
sufficiently
tight
fit
between
the
means
and
the
end.
the
very
opening
sentence
in
the
allegheny
pittsburgh
case
states,
and
i
assume
with
good
reason,
that
the
west
virginia
constitution
commits
the
state
of
west
virginia
to
a
market-based
value
system.
now,
my
analysis
of
that
is
that
there
is
just
is
no
way
that
you
can
satisfy
that
fit,
once
you
start
from
the
premise,
the
fit
between
the
means
and
the
end,
when
you
start
from
the
premise
that
the
end
is
a
market
value-based
system.
you
just
can't
say
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
stood--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh.
oh.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
we
do.
we
don't
refer
specifically
to
that
language.
but
that
is
a
fundamental
difference
in
approach
between
our
opponents
and
us
as
to
the
analysis
of
this
case,
and
particularly
with
regard--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course
it
is,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
if
you
start
from
the
premise
as
my
opponents
do,
that
any
scheme
that
is
not
tied
to
market
value
is
unconstitutional,
then
it
doesn't
matter
whether
that
comes
about
by
constitutional
amendment,
by
an
erratic
operation,
an
erratic
practice
of
the
assessor
or
anyone
else.
and
that
is
necessarily
their
premise.
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
that
is
necessarily
their
premise.
the
only
constitutionally
acceptable
scheme
is
one
that
ties
to
market
value.
now,
if
you
start
from
that
premise,
then
of
course
those
cases
become
relevant,
that
it
doesn't
matter
who
it
comes
about.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
your
basis
for
analysis
is
the
rational
basis
test
and
you
ask
first
of
all,
what
was
california
trying
to
do
here.
and
then
you
ask,
is
there
some
reasonable
fit
between
proposition
13
and
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
then
it
does
matter.
it
does
matter,
the
difference
between
california's
constitution
and
west
virginia's
constitution.
because
it
is
crucial
because
they...
identifies
the
different
purposes,
and
the
purpose
itself
also
provides
the
base
sign
by
which
you
judge
the
tie,
the
necessary
fit,
between
those
two
schemes.
what
the
case
really
comes
down
to...
what
the
case
really
comes
down
to,
is
whether
california
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
adopt
a
different
scheme
than
west
virginia.
and
i
think
the
hardest
part
of
our
case
is
kind
of
the
common
sense,
intuitive,
practical
one
that
for
centuries,
going
back
to
england,
we've
been
accustomed
to
anything
that
is
called
the
property
tax
has
to
be
tied
to
current
value.
and
this
is
the
first
time
in
history
that
any
taxing
jurisdiction
has
unhitched
itself
from
that
kind
of
value.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
it
is.
anything
that
comes
from
the
supreme
court
is
a
valid
statement.
[laughter]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
this
way.
that
the
seasonable
equality
in
the
case
of
california
is
accomplished
against
an
entirely
different
background,
that
is
the
background
of
the
different
policy
that
california
has
adopted
than
was
the
case
in
west
virginia.
and
that
statement,
of
course,
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
was
made
in
the
context
of
a
value-based
system.
let's
assume,
justice
o'connor...
yes?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
really
think
that
that
word
seasonable
means...
just
recognizes
that
even
with
a
current
value
system,
it's
going
to
take
some
time
to
make
some
adjustments.
and
if
i
can
just
drop
a
footnote
and
say
that
we've
got
big
problems
in
this
country
if
it
is
true
that
the
only
constitutionally
acceptable
scheme
is
current
value,
because
even
in
california
and
other
places,
you
never
have
a
complete...
you
never
have
a
complete
one
for
one
because
of
the
cycles
that
are
required
to
make
these
assessments.
but
what
that
refers
to
is
that,
with
a
current
value
system,
it's
going
to
take
some
time
to
make
these
adjustments,
just
because
it
takes
some
time
for
the
assessor
to
get
around
and
make
his
appraisals.
but
the
big
question
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
would
surely
hope
not,
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
feels
most
comfortable,
most
logical
to
me,
in
light
of
what
this
court
has
said
about
rational
basis
and
particularly
in
tax
cases
and
the
difficulties
that
you've
just
mentioned,
to
draw
that
line
between
those
instances
where
the
official
policy
makers
of
the
state,
the
legislature
or
the
constitution
makers,
have
set
forth
the
policy.
i
think
the
real...
the
real...
one
of
the
real
vices
in
the
webster
county
case
was
that
you
just
had
a
runaway
assessor,
who
in
the
face
of
what
the
state
had
done,
that
said,
i'm
just
not
going
to
follow.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
justice
souter.
and
you
always
have
that.
now
you
look
at
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
would
prefer
to
look
at
it,
justice
kennedy,
through
a
slightly
different
prism.
that's
the
approach
that
my
opponent
takes.
my
view
is
that
what
you
ask
is,
has
there
been
a
legitimate
policy
identified
by
the
official
policy
makers
of
the
state?
and
then
secondly,
does
the
particular
scheme
at
issue
pursue
and
is
it
reasonably
contemplated
to
achieve
that
objective.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
falls
closer
to
the
allegheny
pittsburgh
side
of
the
line.
and
the
reason
is
because
you
then
don't...
an
individual
can
certainly
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
and
is
not
doing
it
pursuant
to
an
official
state
policy,
so
that
you
don't
have
the
vent
between
means
and
end.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
cannot
think
of
any
other
than
just
the
general
ones
that
establish
the
rational
basis
test
and
the
general
approach.
well,
and
the
language
in
allegheny
pittsburgh.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
position.
and
if
i
don't,
i
really
do
want
to
understand
it.
but
in
allegheny
pittsburgh,
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
they
had
looked
and
were
not
able
to
find
any
indication
that
there
had
been
a
de
facto
adoption
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
of
this
as
their
policy.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
may
well
be.
the
people
who
really
know
what
underlies
allegheny
pittsburgh,
of
course,
are
the
people
whom
i'm
facing
right
now.
but
i
will
simply
say
this.
[laughter]
that's
right.
that
of
all
of
the
many
possible
explanations
for
allegheny
pittsburgh,
you
come
back
to
this
basis
proposition,
that
what
california
did
here,
and
that's
what
we're
looking
at,
was
to
take
hold
of
a
very
serious
problem,
to
deal
with
it
in
a
responsible
way,
and
what
they
did
squarely
responds
to
the
problem
that
they
were
facing
and
under
the
rational
basis
test,
particularly
in
tax
cases--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it's
just
another
policy
judgment
that
has
been
made
by
the
state
of
california.
and
i
agree
fully
with
justice
scalia,
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
you
want
to
do
is
start
taking
a
red
pencil
and
mark...
and
start
going
through--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
inconsistent.
there
are
two
exceptions
that
i'm
aware
of,
and
they
are
exceptions
to
the
acquisition
value.
they
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
would
certainly
be
severable.
but
i
submit
that
they
also
fit
within
the
rational
basis
test.
in
the
case
of
the
family
passing
on
of
the
favorable
basis,
that's
simply
an
assumption
that
is
no
stranger
to
tax
laws
in
other
contexts,
in
an
attempt
to
treat
the
family
the
same
and
treat
family
properties
the
same,
and
preserve
it
across
generations.
it's
reflected
in
our
inheritance
taxes
as
well.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
there
could,
just
like
there
could
at
the
time
that
my
grandfather
died
and
my
father
got
a
step
up
in
basis
in
his
income
tax
property.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
rational
basis
test
that
says
that
you
can't
adopt
a
basic
acquisition
value
test
and
then
have...
and
then
make
it
a
modified
acquisition
value
test.
let's
assume
that
what
california
had
done
was
to
simply
repeal
its
property
tax...
it
doesn't
exist
any
more...
and
then
enact
in
its
place,
if
you
will...
maybe
they
call
it
an
acquisition
value
tax,
or
an
acquisition
price
tax,
or
a
sales
tax
on
real
property.
and
then,
permit
people
to
pay
it
off
over
a
period
of
time.
i
assume
there
would
be
no
problem
with
that.
and
yet,
when
they
accomplish
something
that
is
very
similar
to
that,
certainly
that
should
not
raise
constitutional
questions.
with
regard
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--sure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
what's
really
counter-intuitive
is
just
the
assumption...
just
the
assumption
that
that's
the
way
we've
done
it
over
the
years.
but
it
is
similar
in
this
respect.
or
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
stevens.
one
is
that
we
have
never
assumed
that
there
has
to
be
a
one-to-one
matching,
benefits
to
what
you
pay,
from
the
tax.
tax
policy
can
be
used
for
the
achievement
of
a
number
of
other
nontax...
and
that's
simply
one
of
the
premises
of
our
tax
policies.
and
the
other
is,
if
we
just
said
that
we
will
use
those
revenues
for
the
same
purposes.
i
will
submit
this.
you
read
every
word
in
my
opponent's
brief
and
you
listen
to
every
word
that
has
been
said
here
orally
today,
and
what
it
necessarily
all
comes
back
to
is
that
you
have
to,
as
a
consequence
of
something
that
is
said
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
tie
your
property...
if
you're
going
to
call
it
a
property
tax,
you
have
to
tie
it.
you
have
to
tie
the
assessment
system
to
the
current
value.
there
are
cases
in
which
this
supreme
court...
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
that
is
not
the
case.
in
related
contexts,
it
can
be
tied,
for
example,
to
nominal
value
or
par
value,
rather
than
current
value.
say
just
a
word
about
the
other
argument
that
is
made,
and
that
is
the
right
to
travel
argument.
in
the
first
place,
it's
not
properly
before
this
court,
if
the
court
applies
using
the
prudential
rules,
because
even
though
ms.
nordlinger
has
article
3
case
or
controversy
standing
to
make
the
argument,
she
is
not
a
person
affected.
and
under
moose
lodge
v.
irvis,
which
is
square
on
point
on
this
issue,
since
she
is
not
one
who
has
moved
interstate,
she
does
not
have
standing
to
make
this
argument.
and
on
the
merits,
this
just
isn't
the
kind
of
case...
even
if
she
were
from
out
of
state...
this
just
isn't
a
right
to
travel
kind
of
case.
it
applies
equally.
the
triggering
feature
is
not
travel.
the
triggering
feature
is
acquisition
of
the
property.
and
it
would
be
an
improper
expansion
of
this
court's
right
to
travel
cases.
what
the
case
comes
down
to,
i
submit,
is
this.
inflation
in
the
price
of
real
estate
in
the
state
of
california
over
the
past
20
years
has
been
a
reality.
it's
going
to
cause
some
problems
to
someone.
it
caused
serious
problems
in
the
1960's
and
1970's.
it
has
caused
other
problems,
as
mr.
hall
has
pointed
out,
since
1978.
there
are
six
briefs,
amicus
briefs,
who
say
that
the
problems
that
the
problems
that
proposition
13
has
created
are
very
serious.
there
are
a
few
more
than
that
that
say
what
it
cured,
the
problems
that
it
eliminated
prior
to
1978,
are
much
more
serious.
now,
who's
right?
who's
right?
are
the
problems
of
possibly
being
taxed
out
of
your
homes
and
not
knowing
what
kind
of
financial
obligations
you're
going
to
have
more
serious
than
the
problem
of
an
imbalance
between
property
tax...
between
the
value
and
the
amount
of
tax
you
pay?
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
anyone...
well,
different
californians
will
have
different
views
on
that
issue,
but
that's
a
matter
for
californians
to
solve
themselves.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you're
dead
right.
and...
but
you
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world,
justice
scalia,
to
suggest
that
because
of
the
existence
of
that
alternative,
we
ought
to
strike
down
the
one
that
california--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course.
of
course.
and
i
can
give
you
a
lot
of
other
examples.
examples
abound
of
how
we
can
eliminate
anomalies
in
the
tax
laws.
but
that
is
not
the
judicial
function.
the
judicial
function
is
a
very
simple
one,
for
which
every
member
of
this
court
should
be
very
grateful.
and
that
is
that
you
just
ask,
was
there
a
serious
problem
that
california
was
trying
to
deal
with.
and
second,
did
they
deal
with
it
in
a
responsible
way
that
demonstrated
some
kind
of
a
reasonable
fit...
some
kind
of
a
reasonable
fit
between
what
they
were
trying
to
deal
with,
and
what
they
in
fact
did?
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
answer
to
that
question...
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
yes,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
courts
should
be
affirmed.
