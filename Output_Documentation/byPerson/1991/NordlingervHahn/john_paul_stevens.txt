and
that
choice
inevitably
placed
a
burden
on
a
different
group
of
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.--
--you
don't
say
this
systems
abounds
throughout
the
state,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
why
wouldn't
that
conceivable
test
satisfy...
been
satisfied
in
the
west
virginia
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
same
arguments
could
have
been
made
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
lee,
if
you
base
it
on
the
difference
between
the
state
law
in
west
virginia
and
california,
what
do
you
do
with
the
dictum
from
the
sunday
lake
iron
company
case
that
your
opponents
quoted
at
page
25
of
their
brief
and
you
didn't
even
mention
in
your
brief?
do
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to?
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
part
of
the
expressed
terms
of
the
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
by
its
improper
execution
through
duly
constituted
agents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
is...
does
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
hardly
fits
the
acquisition
value
theory,
because
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
within
the
family--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
should
be
some
kind
of
valuation
capable
of
being
placed
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
really
isn't
similar,
because
the
real
estate
property
tax
pays
for
a
group
of
services
that
the
owner
of
the
property
gets...
police
protection,
fire
protection,
schools,
as
so
forth.
and
you've
got
neighbors
who
get
the
same
benefits
out
of
the
state...
identical
kinds
of
property,
and
the
same
number
of
children
going
to
school
and
the
like,
and
one
of
them
pays
a
very
large
tax,
and
the
other
pays
a
very
small
tax
for
the
same
state
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
something
counter-intuitive
about
this.
it's
not
a
sales
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there's
another
solution
for
some
of
these
elderly
people
who
have
suddenly
found
their
$10,000
homes
are
worth
a
million
dollars.
some
of
them
can
sell
those
homes
and
still
live,
you
know.
