justice

scalia
of
course,
these
are
not
static
groups,
are
they?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--today
you
may
be
a
continuing
resident,
tomorrow
decide
to
move.
so
it's
not
as
though
citizens
are
identified
permanently
in
one
or
the
other
category.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
is
a
rational
relationship,
mr.
hall.
it
seems
to
me
you're
insisting
that
it
not
only
be
rational
but
be
perfect.
in
response
to
the
question
of
whether
it
didn't
assure
that
people
would
not
be
taxed
out
of
their
homes
so
that
they
could
no
longer,
you
know,
pay
the
taxes
and
therefore
have
to
move,
you
said
well
there
are
other
ways
of
taking
care
of
that.
well,
there
are
indeed,
but
we've
never
insisted
that
in
any
public
policy
field
the
state
has
to
choose
the
most
precise
way
of
solving
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not...
it's
not
very
precise,
but
you
must
admit
it
solves
that
problem.
and
it
seems
to
be
the
main
problem
at
which
it's
been
addressed,
that
people
can't
keep
up
with
constantly
increasing
taxes
on
unrealized
gains
in
their
home.
and
therefore,
to
solve
that
problem
we
have
this
new
tax
system.
it's
rough
and
ready,
it's
not
perfect,
but
close
enough
for
government
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
client...
you
say
your
client
really
had
to
stretch
to
buy
this
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
she
knows
she
won't
be
stretched
any
further,
doesn't
she?
she
knows
that
next
year
it's
not
going
to
be
anything
more
than
2
percent
worse,
and
the
next
year
after
that
no
more
than
2
percent
worse.
isn't
that
some
advantage
to
the
people
of
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
she
is
getting
in
exchange
for
that
is
the
assurance
that
that
little
house,
however
much
it
cost
her,
is
going
to
be
hers
and
she
is
going
to
be
able
to
afford
it
as
long
as
she
has
her
current
level
of
income,
and
the
people
of
california
say
that's
a
good
trade.
we're
willing
to
have
the
one
for
the
other.
she
may
disagree
with
it,
but
why
is
that
an
irrational
deal
to
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
there
ever
a
legitimate
public
purpose
in
assessing
a
tax
on
some
things
rather
than
other
things?
i
mean,
every
jurisdiction
taxes
some
things,
it
doesn't
tax
other
things.
what
is
legitimate
public
purpose
except
because
they
are
there?
is
that
wrong?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
there
really?
except
the
fact
that
we've
chosen
to
tax
this.
suppose
i...
a
jurisdiction
chooses
to
tax
milk,
doesn't
have
taxes
on
other
kinds
of
foods,
but
it
chooses
to
tax
milk.
is
that
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
be
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
rational
because
they
decided
they
want
to
tax
milk.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
milk
drinkers
making
this
same
argument,
you
know.
saying
these
people
over
here
are
drinking
wine,
you
know,
it's
just
flowing
like
water,
and
we
can't--
[laughter]
but
that's
too
bad,
you
know.
they
have
chosen
to
tax
the
one
and
not
the
other.
suppose
this
tax
had
been
on
a
square
footage
basis,
couldn't
it
have
been
just
as
unfair?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
10
square
feet
in
beverly
hills
is
the
same
as
10
square
feet
where
your
client
has
her
bungalow.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
that
might
be
bad
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
principle
really
is
that
there
has
to
be
equality
somehow.
you
cannot
tax--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but,
well
the
equal
protection
clauses
is
not...
not
that
there
has
to
be
equality
in
taxation
or
equality
in
treatment,
it's
that
the
law
has
to
be
applied
equally.
whatever
the
law
is.
you
can't
give
somebody
a
special
exemption
from
the
law.
but
if
the
law
is
you
pay
taxes
on
milk,
you
pay
taxes
on
milk,
and
people
who
don't
use
milk
don't
pay
taxes,
and
that's
not
inequality.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lee,
before
you
get
off
of
allegheny
pittsburgh,
suppose
the
west
virginia
legislature
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
had
passed
a
statute
that
said,
yes,
we
know
we
have
a
current
market
value
system,
but
elderly
people
who
shouldn't
be
assessed
on
their
current
value,
and
we
think
this
is
a
competing
state
policy
and,
although
we
are
using
a
current
market
value
system,
the
elderly
should
not
be
taxed
on
their
unrealized
income.
and
they
passed
a
statute
to
that
effect.
now,
would
we
strike
that
statute
down
because
it
does
not
have
a
rational
basis,
given
the
constitutional
prescription
of
the
west
virginia
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
now
what
if
the
tax
assessor
makes
the
same
conclusion
and
just
doesn't
move
against
elderly
people?
and
you
know
what
my
next
question's
going
to
be.
what
if
the
tax
assessor
does
what
the
tax
assessor
did
in
allegheny
pittsburgh?
in
fact,
he
made
himself
the
individual
judgment
that,
although
we
have
a
general
value
system,
i'm
going
to
modify
it
by
some
unappreciated
income
theory.
i'm
not
going
to
charge
those
people
who
haven't
gotten
the
money
out
of
their
land
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
want
to
review
every
state
decision
to
decide
whether
every
state
administrative
official
is
being
faithful
to
the
constitution.
wasn't
it
key
to
allegheny
pittsburgh
that
this
was
just
one
county?
might
we
not
have
let
that
scheme
stand
in
allegheny
pittsburgh
if
it
had
been
adopted,
just
as
contrarily
to
the
state
constitution
by
the
state
attorney
general
and
had
been
applied
uniformly
throughout
the
state
by
all
county
assessors
at
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general,
who
is
not
the
people
and
who
is
not
an
authoritative
expositor
of
state
policy.
but
at
least
it
wold
make
it
uniform
throughout
the
state,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
an
adequate
explanation
of
allegheny
pittsburgh?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
an
easy
way
to
solve
it
would
just
be
as
inflation
pushes
the
price
up
and
up,
just
lower
the
tax.
there's
no
reason
why
the
fact
that
there's
an
unreasonable
inflation
in
the
value
of
property
has
to
result
in
unreasonably
high
taxes.
