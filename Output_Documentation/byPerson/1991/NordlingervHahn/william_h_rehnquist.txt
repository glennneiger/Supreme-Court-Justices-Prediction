chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-1912,
stephanie
nordlinger
against
kenneth
hahn.
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
did
reserve
that
question
in
the
allegheny
case,
did
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
is
it
irrational?
why
isn't
it
perfectly
rational
for
california
to
say
that
whenever
proposition
13
was
passed
we
had
a
lot
of
people
who
bought
homes
at
much
below
their
present
assessed
value.
they'd
anticipated
a
certain
amount
of
real
property
tax,
now
they
are
paying
three
or
four
times
as
much
real
property
tax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
allegheny
we
had
quite
a
different
situation,
mr.
hall.
it
was
almost
impossible
to
say
what
rational
justification
for
the
west
virginia
system
was,
since
what
the
county
assessor
was
doing
was
squarely
contrary
to
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
if
you'll
read
the
opinion
from
this
court,
the
thrust
of
it
was
that
there
was
no
justification.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
applied
only
in
one
county
in
west
virginia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hall,
in
cases
like
lehnhausen
v.
lake
shore
auto,
we
have
said
that
the
standard
of
rationality
for
reviewing
state
tax
schemes
is
the
very
lowest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fact
you
can
poke
holes
and
make
other
arguments
that
the
legislature
could
have
done
this
or
it
wasn't
complete
here,
or
there's
a
big
gaping
hole
here,
doesn't
mean
it's
irrational
under
that
sense,
so
long
as
there's
some
rational
purpose
that
the
legislature
is
serving.
i
take
it
your
answer
to
all
these
questions
is
that
no
reasonable
person
could
ever
have
concluded
that
this
was
a
sensible
taxing
scheme?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--any
time
you
have
a
taxing
scheme
or
a
change
in
a
taxing,
some
people
are
going
to
benefit,
others
are
not
going
to
benefit.
there's
no
way
in
the
world
to
prevent
that,
and
we
don't
throw
out
taxing
schemes
because
there's
a
large
group
of
people
who
are
hurt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hall.
mr.
lee,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
could
have
by
insisting
that
the
local
and
state
governing
bodies
spend
less
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
lee.
mr.
hall,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hall.
the
case
is
submitted.
