well,
mr.
hall,
in
west
virginia,
i
suppose
the
state
law
required
that
properties
be
put
on
the
rolls
at
current
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
at
least
the
state
law
in
west
virginia
said
you
will
place
properties
on
at
market
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
california
the
constitution
has
been
amended
to
provide
something
other
than
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
acquisition
value.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
do
we
normally
measure
an
equal
protection
claim?
what
standard
do
we
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
rational
basis
test,
normally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
an
argument
can
certainly
be
mounted
that
california's
scheme
is
rationally
related
to
the
goal
of
preventing
people
on
a
fixed
income
from
losing
their
homes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
that
that
doesn't
meet
the
rational
basis
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
in
the
allegheny
case,
the
opinion
says
the
constitutional
requirement
is
the
seasonable
attainment
of
a
rough
equality
in
the
tax
treatment
of
similarly
situated
property
owners.
is
that
a
valid
statement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
does
proposition
13
meet
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
the
california
treatment
is
a
seasonable
attainment
of
equality?
