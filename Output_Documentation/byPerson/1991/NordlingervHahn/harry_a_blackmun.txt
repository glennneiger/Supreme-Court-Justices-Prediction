justice
harry

mr.
hall,
what
is
the
practical
effect
of
proposition
13?
has
it
deadened
the
real
estate
market
in
california?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
where
did
your
client
live
before
she
bought
her
home?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
she
knew
what
she
was
getting
into.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
there's
no
chance
of
having
proposition
13
repealed
by
the
electorate,
is
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
elderly
people
justification
for
the
statute.
what
about
the
grandchildren
and
the
children
of
these
elderly
people?
how
do
they
fit
into
this
scheme?
they
get
the
same
benefit
and
they're
not
all
that
elderly,
as
i
understand
it.
they're
just
sort
of
a
class
of
nobility
in
california.
they
inherit
this
tax
break
and
it
goes
on
through
generation
to
generation.
[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case
is
no.
90-1912,
nordlinger
against
hahn.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
california.
it
concerns
proposition
13
approved
by
california
voters
in
a
statewide
ballot
initiative.
this
added
an
article
to
the
california
constitution
which
embodies
an
acquisition
value
system
of
taxation.
under
that
system,
property
is
reassessed
at
current
appraised
value
only
upon
new
construction
or
a
change
in
ownership.
there
are
exemptions
for
exchanges
for
principle
residences
by
persons
over
55
and
transfers
between
parents
and
children.
longer
term
owners
paid
lower
taxes
reflecting
historic
property
values
and
this
system
over
time
has
created
dramatic
disparities
and
taxes
paid
by
persons
owning
similar
pieces
of
property.
petitioner
who
was
a
recent
purchaser
of
a
home
filed
suit
against
the
county
and
its
tax
assessor
claiming
that
the
scheme
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
complaint
and
the
court
of
appeal
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
acquisition
value
assessment
scheme
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
clause
requires
only
that
the
classification
rationally
furthers
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
right
to
travel
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
we
detect
at
least
two
legitimate
state
interests:
one
is
in
preserving
continuity
and
stability
in
neighborhood
preservation:
the
other
is
that
a
new
owner
does
not
have
the
same
reliance
interest
warranting
protection
against
higher
taxes
as
does
an
existing
owner.
the
provision,
thus,
is
not
palpably
arbitrary,
even
though
it
provokes
some
distaste
on
one's
part
and
may
appear
to
be
unwise
and
unlikely
ever
to
be
reconsidered
repealed
by
ordinary
democratic
processes.
we
cannot
conclude
that
it
is
prohibited
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
he
joins
part
2a
of
the
opinion,
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
