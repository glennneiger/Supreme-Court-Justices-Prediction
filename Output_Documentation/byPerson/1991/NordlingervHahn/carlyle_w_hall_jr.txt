mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
california's
welcome
stranger
method
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
by
taxing
newly
purchased
property
at
many
times
higher
rates
than
property
owned
by
long-time
owners,
without
any
possibility
of
seasonably
attaining
rough
equality
in
tax
treatment.
just
3
years
ago
in
the
allegheny
decision,
this
court
unanimously
concluded
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
to
justify
welcome
stranger
assessment
practices.
the
fact
that
california's
welcome
stranger
system
is
formally
embodied
in
the
state
law
is
not
a
valid
distinction.
we
say
it
can't
make
a
difference;
the
respondents
say
it
must
make
a
different.
for
argument--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--yes,
you
did.
and
for
argument's
sake
let's
assume
that
there
might
be
a
difference,
and
look
to
see
whether
there
should
be
a
difference,
based
on
whether
there
are
any
practical
differences
in
operation
or
in
effects
or
in
justifications.
in
terms
of
the
practical
operations,
the
two
welcome
stranger
systems
function
in
an
identical
fashion.
basically,
they
both
set
up
two
groups
of
taxpayers.
there
is
a
favored
group
of
taxpayers
who
are
going
to
pay
very
low
effective
rates
of
tax,
based
on
low
assessed
values.
then
there's
the
disfavored
group
of
taxpayers
who
are
the
new
buyers,
who
are
going
to
be
coming
in
to
the
system
with
base...
with
assessments
based
on
high
current
market
values,
and
therefore
will
be
paying
higher
taxes
and
higher
effective
tax
rates.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no,
that's
exactly.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no,
that
is
true,
that
citizens
are
not
identified
permanently.
and
indeed,
in
terms
of
their
being
static
groups,
one
of
the
interesting
and
curious
things
about
the
welcome
stranger
phenomenon
is
that
it
links
these
two
groups
together
by
having
the
change
of
ownership
provision
give
higher
tax
assessments
to
the
new
groups
and
the
new
buyers,
the
new
owners,
and
having
the
flat
cap
of
2
percent
on
the
assessments
for
the
old
buyers.
so
the
two
groups
are
intimately
linked
together,
and
over
time
as
the
tax
rates
change,
as
the
assessments
go
up
for
the
new
buyers
and
as
new
money
comes
into
the
system,
the
effective
tax
rates
for
the
long-time
group
is
going
to
get
lower
and
lower
and
lower.
so
it's
a
dynamic
system
that
over
time
inevitably
results
in
a
skewing
of
the
system
so
that
the
effective
tax
rates
of
the
low
tax
group
get
lower
and
lower
and
lower.
and
the
result
of
that
is
that
you
get
these
enormous
disparities
that
you
found
in
the
allegheny
case,
where
you
had
35
to
1
disparities
that
the
court
characterized
as
gross
disparities.
and
in
california
our
court
of
appeal
took
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
our
common
gross
disparities
are
of
that
same
magnitude.
and,
indeed,
the
california
supreme
court
just
last
month,
although
it
didn't
take
this
case
up
for
review,
did
characterize
those
kinds
of
disparities
and
the
way
they
come
about
as
a
wild-card
system.
and
that's
easily
seen
if
you
just
look
at
how
it
treats
like
taxpayers,
like
properties,
in
a
different
way.
you
could
have
identical
houses
next
door
to
each
other
and
they
would
be
taxed
dramatically
differently,
one
tax--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
that's...
the
state
law
was
a
current
market
value
system.
but
the
state
court
said
that
that
current
market
value
system
could
be
coordinated
with
a
welcome
stranger
system,
and
that
this
welcome
stranger
system
that
was
being
practiced
by
the
assessment--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
that's
true,
but--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--when--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
and
that's
what
you
applied
in
allegheny.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
is...
that
is
the
problem
with
the
california
tax
system.
the...
there
is
no...
first
of
all,
there
is
no
goal
of
taxpayers
not
being
taxed
out
of
the
their
homes.
that's
not
a
criteria
that's
in
the
welcome
stranger
system.
the
taxpayers
being
taxed
out
of
their
home
is
being...
is
addressed
in
california
now
as
it
was
before
proposition
13
by
the
so-called
circuit
breaker
legislation
that
provides
tax
relief
to
taxpayers
who
are
in
such
financial
distress
that
they
might
lose
their
home.
proposition
13
does
not
touch
on
that
issue.
what
proposition
13
is
about
is...
and
this
is
the
respondents'
description
of
it
and
i
believe
all
the
amici
say
the
same
thing,
is
giving
tax
relief
to
existing
homeowners
who
were
finding
assessments
rising
and
finding
themselves
taxed
into
financial
distress
because
of
the
hyperinflation
in
the
real
estate
market.
and
what
they
claim
has
happened
is
that
now
the
tax...
taxes
have
fallen,
and
that
now
it's
a
better
system
and
a
better
world.
that's
a--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--i
say
that's
not
a
valid
description
of
the
california
welcome
stranger
system.
the
california
welcome
stranger
system
does
not
simply
lower
taxes
for
long-time
owners.
it
intimately
links
the
tax
breaks
to
the
long-time
owners
with
the
tax
benefits...
i
mean
with
the
tax
burdens
on
the
new
buyers,
so
that
there
is
this
correlation
that
is
irrational.
and
it's
that--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--yes,
it's
irrational
for
the
same
reason
that
the
court
stated
in
allegheny.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
you
have
to
make
a
comparison
of
the
groups
of
people
who--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--the
west
virginia
court
did
not
find
it
so.
the
west...
and
the
west
virginia
court
said
it
was
consistent
with
state
law,
and
could
be
reconciled
with
state
law.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
that's
exactly
right.
the
court
could
not
find
a
justification
in
the
equality
principles
that
were
established
by
the
current
market
value
system
that
the
assessor
claimed
to
meet,
and
also--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--yes,
that's
true.
and
this
particular
assessor
was
instituting
a
discriminatory
system.
and
that
system
was
what
was
at
issue
in
the
allegheny
case.
and
you
looked
at
the
discriminatory
system,
you
looked
to
see
if
it
could
be
reconciled
with
equality
principles
of
the
current
market
value
system
or
discriminatory
principles
of
the
welcome
stranger
system
that
was
at
issue,
and
you
found
that
it
didn't
further
either
set
of
principles.
there
was
no
rational
relationship
to
either
equality
purposes
or
discriminatory
purposes.
and
therefore
you
found
it
completely
irrational,
and
it
did
not
pass
muster
under
the
rational
basis
test.
it's
very
unusual
for
the
court
to
find
that,
but
this
is
a
very
unusual
system.
this
is
the
system
that
the
professional
assessors'
association,
which
is
the
main
professional
group,
condemns
as
the
most
patently
inequitable
tax
assessment
system
that
exists,
that
it's--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--no,
that
would
be
precisely--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--precisely
what
happens
under
the
welcome
stranger
system.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
yes,
that
that...
it's
a
rational
judgment
and
it's--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--no,
it
is
rational.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
yes.
but
the
welcome
stranger
system
takes
that
premise,
which
is
merely
a
description
of
the
fact...
i
mean,
it
is
true
that
the
longer
you
own
your
house
in
an
inflationary
economy,
the
lower
your
assessed
value
will
be
as
compared
to
the
market
value.
but
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
the
welcome
stranger
system
links
the
property
taxes
so
that
one
group
is
down
here
with
low
assessed
values
and
low
effective
tax
rates,
and
another
group
in
the
same
house,
it
could
be
next
door,
is
paying
high
effective
tax
rates
and
high
taxes.
and
there
must
be
some
description
for
the
reason
for
the
difference.
somewhere
in
the
rational
basis
test
you
need
to
have
someone
identify
a
legitimate
objective
for
why
these
taxpayers
are
paying
more,
should
be
subsidizing
in
a
direct
one-to-one
relationship,
dollar
for
dollar,
the
people
who
are
getting
subsidized.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
but
again,
that's
simply
a
description
of
what
is
the
system.
the
question
is,
if
they
have
less
unrealized
value,
what
does
that
mean
in
practical
terms.
what
it
means
is
these...
the
people
who
are
getting
hurt
the
most
under
this
system
are
the
ones
who
are
hurt
the
most
because
of
this
volatile
inflationary
market.
the
very
real
estate
market
that
proposition
13
was
put
in
to
deal
with
is
the
market
that
the
people
who
get
the
high
taxes
are
the
biggest
victims
of.
they're
the
ones
who
pay
these
absurd
mortgages--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--i
think
there
are
different
opinions
of
what
it's
done
to
the
real
estate
market
in
california.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
she
lived
in
los
angeles
as
a
renter
and
could
not
afford
to
buy
a
home.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
she
did,
unfortunately,
realize
that
she
was
going
to
have
to
pay
more
taxes.
she
eas...
she
knew
she
was,
first
of
all,
going
to
have
to
stretch
and
pay
a
very
high
mortgage
rate
for
a
very
modest
house.
and
that's
this...
that's
the
reality
in
los
angeles,
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
of
that.
and
you
can
see
that
just
from
our...
the
pictures
in
our
brief
of
the
tiny
venice
bungalow
that
has
a
$300,000
assessed
value
on
it
because
that's
the
current
market
value.
so--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--unfortunately,
the
court
of
appeal
in
our
case
commented
on
exactly
the
problem
of
the
very,
very
high
vested
interest
that
you
get
from
all
the
people
who
are
benefitting
from
the
system
on
the
benefit
side,
with
these
huge
tax
breaks
that
they're
getting
that
are
directly
pulled
from
the
people
who
are
being
burdened.
and
if
i
could
just
get
to
that
relationship
between
the
people
who
are
benefitted
and
the
people
who
are
burdened.
the
rational
basis
test
says
there
has
to
be
a
rational
relationship.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no,
that's
certainly
the
case,
but
you--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
it
largely
depends--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--it
largely
depends
on
how
you
define
the
problem.
if
you
define
the
problem
let's
give
low
taxes
increasingly
to
people
who
are
existing
owners.
it
does
a
fine
job
of
that.
that
is
the
system,
but
if
you
define
the
problem
as
saying
why
is
there
this
relationship
that's
a
topsy-turvy
relationship,
that's
the
irrationality.
it's
not
simply
that
a
state
or
some
body
somewhere
has
said
it's
a
good
idea
to
have
high
taxes
on
some
people
and
low
taxes
on
other
people.
the
taxes
are
linked
in
a
very
odd
way,
and
the
burdened
class
is
the
class
that's
stretched
right
now
for
their...
to
pay
these
mortgage
payments.
they
have
very
little
equity.
and
the--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
she
knows
that,
but
she
also
knows
that
in
the
meantime
she
is
paying
enormous
subsidies
to
people
in
an
unfair
way,
because
she
is
in
a
little
modest
house
and
she
is
paying
the
same
taxes
that
a
taxpayer
in
malibu
on
the
ocean
in
a
fabulous
lot
is
paying.
there
is
no
fairness
in
that.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
well,
if
you...
if...
first
of
all,
because
she
has
been
picked
out
as
a
person
who
is
in
no
better
shape
to
bear
these
burdens
than
the
people
who
are
getting
the
benefits.
and
who
are
getting
the
benefits?
let's
look
at
that
side.
the
people
who
are
getting
the
benefit,
the
biggest
benefit,
the
people
with
the
lowest
effective
tax
rate,
are
the
people
who
are
just
like
stephanie
nordlinger,
but
they
are
living
next
door
to
her
and
they
bought
at
$15,000
or
$25,000,
and
they
have
had
huge
appreciation
in
value
in
the
meantime.
so
they
have
very
low
effective
tax
rates
and
huge
appreciation
in
value.
and
if
you
go
back
in
time,
you
get
the
most
antiquated
assessed
values
and...
you
get
back
to
1925
or
1935,
and
you
could
say,
well,
what
is
there
about
the
ability
to
pay
of
those
people
that
we
can
tell
in
comparison
to
stephanie
nordlinger.
you
can
tell
nothing.
it's
a--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--untaxed.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no.
the
very
irrationality
of
that
premise
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
people
who
live
in
beverly
hills
in
the
mansions
in
the
pictures
in
the
brief
are
in
the
highest
appreciation
areas
in
los
angeles,
and
because
those
areas
have
skyrocketed
in
appreciation,
they
are
paying
the
lowest
effective
tax
rates.
now
there
is
nothing
you
can
say
that
indicates
that
the
people
living
in
mansions
in
beverly
hills
who
have
enormous
wealth
in
those
homes
and
presumably
what
it
took
to
get
there
and
keeping
pace
with
inflation,
et
cetera,
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
say
that
those
people
are
worse
able
to
pay
taxes
than
the
people
who
are
in
the
venice
bungalow
and
stretched
to
pay
a
$300,000
mortgage.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
well,
interestingly--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--interestingly
enough,
the
people
in...
the
people
in
the
middle
are
the
people
who
still
own
their
homes
that
owned
them
in
1978.
there
are
no
people
in
the
middle--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it's
rational
to
make
the
assumption
that
people
who
live
in
beverly
hills
mansions--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
even
if
you
are
talking
about
a
3
to
1
disparity
rather
than
a
15
to
1
disparity
at
the
ends,
there's
nothing
to
justify
why
one
group
who's
coming
in,
who's
even
more
strapped
to
pay
the
higher
mortgage
should
be
paying
at
the
higher
rate
than
the
favored
group.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
i
think
it's
rational
to
assume
that
the
person
who
has
the
bigger
equity,
who
right
now
is
being
favored
by
proposition
13,
can
refinance,
yes.
they
have
the
ability
to
refinance,
in
effect,
absolutely.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no,
no,
because
they
also
have
the
benefit
of
inflation
probably,
which...
the
welcome
stranger
system
doesn't
take
into
account,
et
cetera.
again,
the
irrationality
of
the
system
can
be
seen,
and
here's
another
very
good
example
of
it
in
the
fact
that
two-thirds
of
the
property
value
that's
underassessed,
in
the
state
of
california,
is
commercial
property.
and
the
one
thing
you
can
say
is
that
the
current
market
values
of
commercial
property
do
relate
to
their
ability
to
generate
current
income.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
people
who
are
getting
the
benefits
of
the
taxing
scheme
think
there's
perfect
rationality--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--to
it
because
it's
their
benefit.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
absolutely.
the
court's
rational
basis
test
is
a
deferential
test,
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
test,
and
you
have...
you
just
can't
just
say
that
because
one
group
has
been
chosen
by
another
group
to
bear
the
burden
of
increased
taxes
that
are
going
to
directly
subsidize
the
favored
group,
that
there
is
necessary...
necessarily
rationality
or
legitimacy
to
the
public
policies
that
are
being
served.
you
have
to,
under
the
rational
basis
test,
take
a
look
at
it
and
see
is
there
a
rational
purpose
being
served?
now
mr.
lee's
briefs,
the
respondent's
briefs,
they
have
not
tried
to
point
out
reasons
why
that
link
between
the
two
groups
is
rational.
the
authors
of
proposition
13,
they
have
given
a
reason,
and
they
said
we
picked
out
the
new
buyers
to
bear
the...
and
recent
buyers
to
bear
the
brunt
of
this
system
and
to
link,
link
it
so
that
we
will
get
benefits
every
time
their
equities
go...
their
market
values
go...
the
regular
market
value
goes
up.
we're
going
to...
we
chose
that
method
and
that
group
of
taxpayers
because
they
were
there.
that's
as
simple
as
their
explanation.
we
couldn't
keep
our
taxes
low,
for
us,
and
still
have
the
government
give
us
services
unless
we
found
someone
to
bear
the
burden,
and
they
found
the
new
buyers.
they
were
the
convenient
target.
but
there
is
no
legitimate
public
purpose
in
that,
and
mr.
lee's
briefs
and
the
respondent's
have
not
tried
to
make
an
argument
that
there
is
a
legitimate
public
purpose.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
well,
you...
anytime
you
have
a
tax
or
any
other
discriminatory
classification
that
the
government
is
undertaking,
choosing
one
group
to
bear
high
taxes
and
another
group
getting
benefitted,
there
has
to
be
some
legitimacy,
some
rationality
to
that.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
no,
that
wouldn't
be
bad
at
all.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
because
as
long
as
they
do
it
in
a
rational
way.
this
court
has
said
there
is
a--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--well,
if
they
want
to
and
there's
a
rational
reason
for
it,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
states
and
local
people
have
wide
discretion
in
making
classifications.
but
this
court
also
held
in
the
allegheny
case
that
the
welcome
stranger
method,
the
way
it's
linked,
the
way
it
works,
the
arbitrariness
of
it,
the...
in
our
case,
where
you
have
commercial
property
that
is
being
subsidized
by
people
living
in
tiny
bungalows
and
the
commercial
property
has
current
income
flows
that
are
equal
in
1
year
to
the
entire
value
of
the
bungalow
that
is
subsidizing
them,
that's
completely
irrational.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
well,
a
quantified
tax--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--a
quantified
tax
can
have
some
unfairness
to
it
around
the
edges,
but
that
would
still
be
judged
by
the
rational
basis
test,
and
if
you
had--
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
--ah-hah.
yes,
if
you
had,
for
example,
commercial
property,
paying
the
same
tax
as
the
bungalow
owner,
you
might
say,
well,
what's
the
purpose
of
this
tax.
why
are
we
linking
these
two
together
when
it's
a
wildly
different
situation?
there
still
would
have
to
be
a
rational
basis.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
it's
the
equal
protection
clause's
principle.
it's
not
my
principle.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
but
this
court
has
never
found
a
tax
on
milk
to
be...
to
flunk
the
rational
basis
test,
but
the
court
found
the
welcome
stranger
method
to
flunk
the
rational
basis
test.
i
submit
that
they
are
very
different.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carlyle
w.
hall,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
exceptions
to
the
acquisition
value
premise
of
this
system,
i'd
also
point
out
that
all
of
property
that
has
a
1975
base
year,
which
is
approximately
44
percent
of
the
property
in
the
state,
is
not
operating
according
to
the
acquisition
value
premise.
it's
all...
it's
had
its
basis
increased
up
to
1975,
irrespective
of
what
the
acquisition
date
or
acquisition
value
was.
with
respect
to
whether
we
are
asserting
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
current
market
value
system,
that's
clearly
not
what
we're
saying.
and
i
think
our
briefs
indicate
that
absolutely
clearly.
what
we're
saying
is,
you
can't
have
a
system...
property
tax
system
in
which
some
people
are
taxed
at
current
market
values
and
other
people
are
taxed
at
antiquated
assessed
values.
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
ever
considered,
or
that
there
has
ever
been
a
welcome
stranger
system.
indeed,
there
was
one
in
the
webster
county
case.
and
finally,
i
don't
agree
that...
with
mr.
lee's
characterization
of
what
this
case
boils
down
to.
i
think
really
what
it
comes
down
to
is
whether
this
court
really
wants
to
get
into
the
whole
business
of
looking
at
the
way
state
administers...
administrators
have
administered
state
law,
and
whether
they've
reconciled
state
law
policies
with
their
own
policies,
and
whether
they've
strayed
too
far
from
official
state
policies
in
their
implementation
of
the
law.
and
that's
the
precise
implication
of
what
the
respondents'
attempted
distinguishing
of
the
allegheny
cases
is,
is
that
this
court
would
get
into
the
business
of
measuring
the
compliance
of
state
law
officials...
state
executive
and
local
officials...
with
how
far
they've
strayed
from
some
official
state
policy,
as
they've
tried
to
adopt
their
own
policies
on
a
local
basis
or
executive
basis
to
temper
those
official
policies.
thank
you.
