justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
of
these
transfers
there
are?
justice
stevens
thousands?
justice
stevens
and
would
the
change
in
the
consent
decree
that
you're
asking
for
totally
eliminate
these
transfers?
justice
stevens
mr.
janiak,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
standard
on
the
changed
circumstances?
in
your
view,
must
those
changed
circumstances
be
unforeseen
changed
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
all
right
if
everybody
could
predict
the
increase
in
prison
population,
and
then
they
still...
you
could
still
rely
on
that
increase
to
do
it.
that's
critical
to
your
case,
i
guess,
'cause
here
the
district
judge
found
that
circumstances
were
not
unforeseen,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
your
standard
has
the
same
problem
in
it.
because
suppose
you
get
the
relief
that
you
ask
for
and
then
the
prison
population
continues
to
grow...
as
it
no
doubt
will,
with
so
many
people
being
put
in
jail.
and
you
now
come
back
and
say
we
need
another
100
double-cells.
wouldn't
he
have
to
give
it
to
you?
you
may
answer,
yes.
justice
stevens
whether
foreseen
or
unforeseen.
justice
stevens
mr.
montgomery,
on
your
theory
that
the
power
of
the
court
terminated
when
the
new
facility
was
built,
what
case
in
this
court
most
strongly
supports
your
suggestion?
or
is
this
a
brand-new
theory
that
we
should
adopt?
justice
stevens
dowell
was
your
authority.
justice
stevens
mr.
stern,
isn't
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
particular
plaintiffs
in
the
case
will
be
bound,
but
that
would
not
bind
the
next
group
of
inmates
who
came
in
because
they
certainly
would
not
be
bound
by
a
consent
decree
to
which
they
are
not
a
party?
justice
stevens
mr.
stern,
was
there
any
constitutional
violation
proved
in
this
case
other
than
the
double-celling?
justice
stevens
so
the
court
had
the
power
to
fashich
a
remedy
for
a
constitutional
violation
that
was
proved.
and
did
anybody
question
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
enter
the
decree
they
entered?
