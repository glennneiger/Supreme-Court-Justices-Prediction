mr.
max
d.
stern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
is
what
standard
should
have
governed
judge
keeton's
exercise
of
discretion
when
he
considered
a
1989
motion
to
modify
an
order
requiring
single
occupancy
which
had
been
entered
in
1979
and
then
modified
and
reaffirmed
explicitly
in
1985.
the
1979
consent
decree
was
entered
after
this
case
had
been
pending
since
1971,
after
a
1973
finding
of
violation,
and
an
order
to
close
the
jail.
after
5
years
a
complete
impasse
had
been
developed
and
no
remedy
had
been
supplied
or
was
even
proposed
by
the
defendants.
the
question
was,
then,
how
to
get
out
of
this
impasse.
and
the
answer
that
was
supplied
by
the
first
circuit
was
that
this
jail,
at
long
last,
will
have
to
close
unless
the
defendants
are
prepare
to
commit
in
an
enforceable
way
to
the
specifics
of
a
plan...
that
is,
a
jail,
a
site,
specific
criteria,
and
so
forth.
and
out
of
that
came
the
plan
which
they
submitted
in
october
of
1978
and
which
was
approved
and
which
became
the
consent
decree
of
1979
which
required
single
occupancy.
and
then,
again,
in
april
of
1985
that,
a
new
order
was
entered
which
was
entered
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
population
had
been
rising
and
was
likely
to
continue
to
rise.
and
it,
therefore,
permitted
the
defendants
to
build
a
new
facility
of
any
size
without
any
court
permission,
provided...
explicitly...
that
single
occupancy
is
maintained
under
the
design
for
the
new
facility.
so
this
consent
decree
and
its
modification
had
everything
to
do
with
what
would
be
in
the
new
facility.
we
say
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
inequity
beyond
collateral
attack
on
the
merits.
this
is
required
by
rule
60(b)(5)
and
by
the
policy
of
encouraging
settlements.
and
settlements
are
important.
and
not
only
in
order
to
preserve
judicial
resources.
consent
decrees
provide
better
relief,
it
is
more
finely
tuned,
it's
more
sensitive
to
the
interest
of
plaintiffs,
and
more
deferential
to
the
interest
of
defendants,
and
particularly
state
and
local
governments
and
executive
agencies.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
a
very
persuasive
informational
brief
is
that
supplied
by
the
correctional...
former
correctional
officials
as
amici.
mr.
max
d.
stern
we...
yes,
we
have
no
problem
with
the
swift
standard.
but
our
position
is--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--yes,
i
understand
that.
but
our
position
is--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--well,
perhaps
not.
but
in
any
event,
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
there
must
in
any
event
be
some
minimum
threshold
standard
which
is
enough
to
make
a
consent
decree
worth
entering.
if
the
parties
do
not
get
some
benefit
of
the
bargain,
if
they
are
not
guaranteed
something
beyond
relitigation
in
the
future,
then
nobody
will
enter
a
consent
decree.
and
we
think
that
if
the
court
adopts
a
standard
which
has
some
minimum
threshold
showing
such
as
that,
then
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
case
whether
the
swift
standard
is
applied
or
this
other
standard.
in
fact,
judge
keeton
applied
both
the
swift
standard
and
the
standard
that
was
suggested
by
the
sheriff
at
that
time.
the
commissioner--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--well,
i
think
it
was
a
little
more
than
one
sentence,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
he
got
to
the...
and
he
dealt
with
what
is
the
central
and
most
important
part
of
the
standard,
at
least
as
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general
and
as
applied
by
other
courts
in
other
circuits.
and
that...
and
that
is
what
we
think
is
the
first
component
of
any
standard
is,
what
were
the
basic
purposes
of
the
decree.
a
proposed
modification
must
be
on
account
of
changed
circumstances
and
in
accord
with
the
principle
purposes
of
the
original
decree.
the
question
is,
what
was
agreed
to.
is
this
really
a
new
circumstance
or
is
this
something
that
was
contemplated
all
along?
if
the
parties
in
a
consent
decree
agree
that
if
x
happens,
then
you
shall
do
y,
well,
then
if
x
ultimately
happens,
it
cannot
possibly...
that
cannot
possibly
supply
a
reason
for
getting
out
of
the
obligation.
mr.
max
d.
stern
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--i
believe
that
is
what
local
93
established.
there
were
four
criteria:
had
to
be
within
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
had
to
be
within
the
scope
of
the
pleadings.
it
had
to
serve
the...
objectives
of
the
underlying
law.
and
it
had
to
be
not
affirmatively
prohibited
by
federal
law.
and
i
would
submit
that
this
case
is
actually
much
stronger
than
local
93.
mr.
max
d.
stern
well,
it's
the
basis--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--i
would
say
so,
as
long
as
it
is
within
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
max
d.
stern
i
suppose
you
could
put
it
that
way,
but
that
is
what
a
consent
decree
is
all
about...
although
it
is
not
completely
a
private
contract
because,
since
it
is
also
an
order,
it
isn't
immutable.
there
is
always
an
escape
hatch
where
a
party
can
get
out
for
real
need.
and
that
is
why
rule
60(b)
applies.
and
rule
60(b)
says
if
its
inequitable,
you
can
get
out
of
it.
mr.
max
d.
stern
well,
i
suppose.
there
are
number
of
things
i
would
respond
to
that.
first
of
all,
in
a
way,
that
is
local
93
because
in
local
93
the
statute
sets
specifically
that
if
this
case
is
tried,
this
relief
cannot
be
entered.
that
is
what
congress
said.
and
this
court
nonetheless
said,
as
a
matter
of
consent
decree,
you
can
enter
it.
secondly,
this
case
does
not
present
the
issue
of
whether
judge
keeton,
in
his
discretion,
declined
to
enter
that
decree
whether
he
would
be
obliged
to
do
it.
this
consent
decree
was
entered.
and
now
the
issue
is,
is
it
enforceable.
and
thirdly,
this
case
in
such
a
real
way
comes
out
of
the,
serves
the
objective--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--we
say
it
is...
not
necessarily.
we
agree
that
there
is
no
per
se
rule.
we
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
max
d.
stern
your
honor,
please,
this
was--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--yes,
it
is.
and
that
is
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--that
was
the
deal.
bell
v.
wolfish
was
pending
in
this
court
at
the
very
moment
that
we
signed
that
consent
decree.
everybody--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--of
course.
that
was
exactly
the
point.
everybody
decided
to
finesse,
everybody
decided
to
hedge
their
bets
and
make
this
deal.
and
bell
was
decided...
7
days
after
the
consent
decree
was
entered,
bell
was
decided.
nobody
did
anything
about
it.
and,
indeed,
6
years
later,
we
reaffirmed
the
consent
decree
and
provided
for
single-cell
occupancy,
way
after
bell
was
decided.
so
that
was
completely
understood
at
the
time.
mr.
max
d.
stern
this
is,
if
i
might
say
so,
this
is
an
even
stronger
case
than
local
93
because
at
least
here,
unlike
local
93,
this
was
a
very
disputable
issue.
why
can't
parties
settle
disputable
issues?
and
if
the
answer
to
it
is
that
they
can
settle
disputable
issues,
then
the
answer
to
that
is
it
must
be
possible
to
enforce
it
at
a
later
time.
mr.
max
d.
stern
that
is
exactly
why
rule
60(b)(5)
provides
the
leeway
for
defendants
to
get
out
of
it
in
a
substantial
change
of
circumstances.
but
i
don't
think...
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
one
cannot
settle
legal
issues
in
equitable
cases
where
the
issue
is
whether
there
shall
be
an
injunction,
then
i
do
not
think
you
can
say
that
a
federal
court
can
never
enforce
a
decree
which
is
arguably
greater
than
the
constitution
requires.
if
you
were
to
hold
that,
that
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
litigation
in
any
consent
decree.
every
consent
decree
would
be--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
if
the
consent
decree
had
provided
for
double
cells?
mr.
max
d.
stern
i
see.
mr.
max
d.
stern
well,
i
think
you
then
might
have
the
system
federation
case.
mr.
max
d.
stern
well,
the
system
federation
case
held
that
when
the
result
that
was
part
of
the
consent
decree,
it
turns
out
to
be
affirmatively
contrary
to
federal
law,
when
the
result...
in
system
federation
the
consent
decree
said
union
shops
are
illegal.
then
congress
passes
a
statute.
mr.
max
d.
stern
well,
that
is
certainly
the
basis
for
jurisdiction.
but
then
the
question
is,
when
can
one
settle
a
case?
mr.
max
d.
stern
i
do
think
that
there
is
parity
and
that
both
sides
are
bound
in
this
class
action.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--i
think
the
question
is
whether
the,
whether
system
federation
would
apply,
whether
there
is
a
difference
because
this
court
has
now
held
that
something
is
illegal.
that
has
not
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
max
d.
stern
we
certainly
have
not
argued
and
don't
argue
that
anything
could
be
done
to
enlarge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
defendants
have
ever
said
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
so
i
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether,
if
you
have
an
issue...
and
after
all,
even
under
bell,
the
issue
was
always
whether
it
is
to
a
certain
degree
the
question
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
max
d.
stern
i
do
think
that
a
court.
mr.
max
d.
stern
does
have
such
power.
mr.
max
d.
stern
but
at
least
it
has
such
power
when
it
is
a
disputable
issue
at
the
time
the
court
approaches
it,
when
it
is
something
that
is
negotiable,
something
that
could
go
either
way.
and
that
is
really
what
we
had
here,
something
that
could
go
either
way.
mr.
max
d.
stern
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
this
was--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--no
one
questioned
the
jurisdiction
at
the
beginning
or
the
middle
or
the
end
or
anytime
during
this
20-year
episode.
and
as
i
have
said,
it
became
essential
to
find
a
means
of
providing
a
remedy
for
the
original
unconstitutionality
of
the
old
jail.
and
that
means
was
to
allow
the
defendants
to
continue
the
use
of
the
old
facility,
which
they
did
for
another
10
years,
while
they
constructed
a
new
facility
according
to
specific
criteria.
mr.
max
d.
stern
i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
couldn't
think
of
any
way.
mr.
max
d.
stern
perhaps
so.
i...
we
are
not
saying
that
we
should
take
the
law
of
contract
and
simply
import
it.
but
certainly
in
considering
how
we
look
at
consent
decrees
and
do
we
look
at
them
differently
than
adjudicated
decrees,
we
certainly
will
look
to
contract
law
for
some
of
the
basic
principles.
and
the
most
basic
principle
of
all
is
the
reason
people
enter
into
these
arrangements
is
because
they
expect
the
court
eventually
to
enforce
their
settled
expectations.
mr.
max
d.
stern
that's
all
i
need
in
this
case.
mr.
max
d.
stern
no,
it
wouldn't,
because
once
the
consent
decree
is
negotiated
and
entered...
first
of
all,
in
the
process
of
negotiation,
there
are
mutual
trade-offs.
it
is
a
process
of
settlement.
they
give
up
something,
we
give
up
something.
they
give
up
something
else,
we
give
up
something
else.
most
of
these
are
very
complicated
things
with
many
mutually
independent
trade-offs.
and
secondly--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--some
points
are
close
questions
of
the
law,
but
other
points
are
not.
you
might
give
up
one
thing
in
return
for
another.
we
gave
up
another
10
years
of
confinement
in
the
old
jail
in
return
for
some
form...
for
exactly
this,
for
a
consent
decree
which
laid
out
specifically
what
it
would
have
and,
most
importantly,
within
it...
most
importantly,
and
this
was
clear
all
the
way
along,
single
occupancy.
that
is
what
we
wanted
most
of
all.
that
is
what
judge
garrity
said
was
most
important,
what
he
said
they
were
unequivocally
committed
to.
mr.
max
d.
stern
it
would
still
mean...
and,
of
course,
that
is,
the
burden
is
always
on
the
movement.
that
isn't
really
any
different
than
what
the
defendants
are
suggesting.
they
are
saying
we
will
take
the
burden
on
that
point.
the
movement
always
has
the
burden.
but
if
you
allow
them
to
collaterally
attack
the
decree,
then
what
would
happen
is,
in
each
and
every
decree,
every
defendant
would
move
to
vacate
the
decree,
modify
it,
every
time
they
thought
they
had
grounds
to...
arguable
grounds
to
undo
it.
and
you
would
litigate
these
things
and
re-litigate
them
forever,
and
ultimately
i
do
not
think
anybody
would
go
into
them
because
after
all,
as
a
plaintiff's
attorney,
why
would
i
give
the
other
side
the
right
to
blow
the
whistle
at
any
time
and
whatever
time
and
turf
they
chose,
say
now
we
want
to
litigate.
i
would
rather
litigate
it
at
the
initial
time.
therefore,
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
more
than
collateral
attack.
and
it
has
to
be
a
purpose.
and
that's
what
judge
keeton
found,
and
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
agreed
with.
and
secondly,
there
has
to
be
some
showing
of
need,
as
well.
there
has
to
be
nexus
between
the
supposed
new
circumstance
and
the
impracticability
of
complying
with
the
decree.
a
temporary
problem
should
not
be
a
reason
to
do
away
with
a
decree
all
together.
to
illustrate
in
this
case,
the
sheriff
in
the
old
jail
had
a
capacity
of
342
cells.
and
for
years
he
made
this
work,
even
as
the
population
went
up
and
up
and
up.
and
now
when
we
have
the
new
jail,
the
new
jail
opens
with
a
new
capacity
of
71
additional
cells,
which
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
on
the
basis
of
that
record
that
there
was
any
need
at
all
to
double-bunk
on
this
record.
now,
there
is
no
other
record,
no
better
record.
we
don't
know
exactly
what
has
been
happening
on
this
record
in
the
last
year
and
a
half
for
precisely
the
reason
that
the
sheriff
refused
to
try
it
out.
another
one
of
the
criteria
that
a
court
must
impose
as
part
of
the
showing
of
equity,
again
suggested
by
us
and
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
he
must
try
in
good
faith
to
comply
with
the
decree.
he
didn't
want
to
try
at
all.
he
went
to
the
court.
so
his
record
has
to
do
with
what
happened
in
the
old
jail
prior
to
the
time
he
had
this
enormous
increase
in
capacity.
we
say
that
there's
no
showing
in
the
short
term
and
much
less
is
there
showing
in
the
long
term.
in
1984
when
the
jail
was...
when
the
population
was
going
up,
the
sheriff
did
not
go
to
the
federal
judge
then
and
say,
i
need
to
have
double
occupancy.
he
went
over
to
the
state
court
and
said,
i
need
to
have
a
bigger
jail
because
i
am
obliged
to
have
single
occupancy
in
the
jail.
so
over
the
long
term,
the
state
court
has
held
that
the
sheriff
is
entitled
to
have
a
jail
of
sufficient
capacity
to
comply
with
the
federal
order
requiring
single
occupancy.
so
there's
no
showing
of
need
on
this
record.
mr.
max
d.
stern
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
max
d.
stern
well,
until
there
is
a
change
of
circumstance,
if
there
is
one,
but
at
least...
at
least
beyond
the
day
the
jail
is
supposed
to
open
its
doors.
at
least
try
it
out.
that's
all
we
are
saying
and
that
is
all
judge
keeton
said.
try
it
out.
certainly,
if
they
tried
it
out
and
they
had
a
problem,
if
there
really
were
transfers
that
are
problematic
and
so
forth,
he
could
then
come
back
and
say,
this
is
what
the
problems
were.
but
he
didn't
even
want
to
do
that.
mr.
max
d.
stern
that
is
certainly
true
over
the
long
term.
mr.
max
d.
stern
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
should
also
add
that
certainly
as
a
temporary
matter,
we
agree.
we
are
not
saying
that
if
there
is
some
temporary
emergency
that
is
totally
unforeseen,
that
they
cannot
do
anything
about...
if
half
the
jail
were
to
burn
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
would
have
half
the
capacity,
we
are
not
saying
that
they
could
not
go
in
and
get
a
modification
and
order
to
double-bunk
until
they
could
deal
with
this
on
a
more
permanent
basis.
this
was
the
duran
case
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
judge
posner,
where
the
holding
was
basically
temporarily
yes,
but
temporarily
only.
and
we
agree
with
that.
i
should
add
on
this
question
of
need,
the
real
contention
of
the
sheriff,
which
he
makes
rather
forthrightly
in
his
reply
brief,
is
that
what
he
needs
and
what
he
wants
is
the
option
to
double-cell,
the
option
to
double-cell
if
at
some
point
in
the
future,
in
his
sole
discretion,
he
should
decide
he
needs
to
do.
and
i
think
there
is
where
the
fundamental
fallacy
is
between
the
petitioner's
position
and
ours...
in
their
position.
they
mix
up
the
question
of
the
deference
to
be
paid
to
discretion
on
the
merits
as
opposed
to
the
discretion
to
be
exercised...
official
discretion
exercised
on
the
question
of
whether
to
overthrow
a
decree.
certainly,
on
the
merits
we
have
to...
the
federal
court
is
bound
to
defer
to
official
discretions.
there
are
many
problems
to
be
solved.
there
are
many
fine
lines
to
be
drawn.
and
by
and
large,
it
is
not
up
to
a
federal
court
to
draw
those
lines.
but
when
you
have
a
consent
decree
and
the
official
decides
i
will
exercise
my
discretion,
to
do
it
this
way,
or
draw
the
line
that
way,
and
then
you
get
into
a
consent
decree
and
there
are
mutual
undertakings
and
it
is
relied
upon
in
various
ways
and
it
goes
on
for
years,
at
that
point
the
federal
court
can't
just
say,
all
right,
defer
to
his
discretion.
at
that
point
the
federal
court
has
to
say,
look,
is
there
a
legitimate
need
for
this.
because
if
there
is
not
a
legitimate
need,
if
the
party
isn't
even
willing
to
try
it
out,
then
essentially
what
the
party
has
is
a
unilateral
veto
over
this
consent
decree,
and
nobody
would
ever
agree
with
those.
another
requirement
is
that
the
motion
be
timely.
the
sheriff
waited.
he
knew
that
the
jail...
the
population
was
going
up.
rather
than
go
and
try
to
enlarge
the
jail
as
he
had
before,
he
just
sat
on
it,
waited
until
the
design
was
literally
in
concrete.
now
this
design
was
designed
specifically...
it
was
specifically
premised
on
single
occupancy.
the
whole
idea
was
to
preserve
privacy
while
maintaining
safety.
the
way
you
did
it
was
single
occupancy
and
put
the
cells
in
an
isolated
fashion
so
they
cannot
be
maintained
under
constant
surveillance,
so
somebody
isn't
always
looking
in
the
door
and
watching
you
go
to
the
bathroom.
that
was
basically
what
the
idea
was.
we
can
have
it
both
ways.
now
if
the
sheriff
had
moved
at
a
time--
mr.
max
d.
stern
--justice
scalia,
perhaps
not
a
constitutional
requirement.
but
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
is
whether
having
drawn
the
lines
that
way,
having
made
a
jail
that
is
built
in
that
way,
having
therefore
created
a
situation
where
it
will
be
positively
dangerous
to
put
people
in
double...
double-bunk
people
in
cells
that
are
isolated
and
difficult
to
observe,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
and
that
is
the
position
we
think
the
defendants
have
put
us
in
by
waiting
all
that
time
to
say
i
want
to
change
the
plan.
if
they
had
done
it
earlier...
and
you
can
look
at
page
261
of
the
appendix,
look
at
the
diagram
of
the
viewing
limits
from
the
guard
stations
and
you
will
see
exactly
what
i
mean
about
how
this
jail
is
configured
in
a
very
unique
way,
creating
very
serious
damage
to
our
client
simply
by
the
way
they
did
it.
we
could
have
changed
it.
we
could
have
made
it
bigger.
we
could
have
made
the
cells
bigger.
we
could
have
designed
it
in
a
different
way...
in
changing
the
consent
decree,
if
there
were
grounds
to
do
it.
finally,
if
i
just
might
say
i
find
it
somewhat
ironic
that
the
federal
courts
in
this
case
would
be
criticized
as
somehow
anti-federalist.
in
this
case...
this
case
is
a
marvel
of
how
to
implement
relief
in
a
federal
system.
the
federal
courts
never
imposed
the
remedy
on
the
defendants.
the
federal
court
never
said
how
many
to
hold,
how
many
to
release.
judge
keeton
even
made
his
order
automatically
amendable
if
there
was
a
change
of
an
order
in
the
supreme
judicial
court.
no
one
can
say
judge
keeton
was
not
sensitive
and
cautious
about
the
interest
of
the
defendants.
all
he
did
was
say,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
out
of
an
obligation
which
you
undertook
and
which
you
reaffirmed
and
which
was
central
to
the
case
without
good
reason.
all
the
said
was,
you
have
to
try
it.
and
therefore,
he
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
