justice
white
how
did
the...
how
did
a
cell
in
the
new
facility
compare
with
the
old
facility?
justice
white
if
it
was
going
to
have
two
people
in
it?
justice
white
what
about
the...
and
you
suggested
in
the
smallest
of
these
cells
that
some
might
be
double-bunked?
justice
white
double-bunked,
which
would
be
less
commodious
than
the
old...
the
old--
justice
white
--facility.
justice
white
yes,
but
i
suppose...
your...
the
decree...
the
court
refused
to
set
aside
the
decree
based
on
the
standard
that
you
attack.
justice
white
now,
let's
assume
we
agreed
with
you.
nobody
got
around
to...
below
to
deciding
whether
or
not
double-bunking
in
this
new
facility
would
be
a...
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
white
what
if
we
agreed
with
you,
wouldn't
we
just
remand
to
have
the
eighth
amendment
issue
fleshed
out
in
the
court
below?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
it
may
be--
--it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
enter
a
decree
that
would
order
a
state
to
do
more
than
the
constitution
required,
whether
consent
or
not.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
white
i
suppose
a
district
court
can...
if
he
thinks
he's...
there's
really
a
constitutional
violation
involved,
can
spell
out
what
he
thinks
might
be
an
appropriate
remedy,
and
especially
if
it's
consented
to,
he
could
enter
the
order.
but
it
still
has
to
be,
at
root,
a
constitutional
violation
that
he's
purporting
to
enter
an
order
about.
justice
white
if
they
wanted
to
have
a
question
about
the...
present
a
question
about
the
new
jail,
they
should
start
a
new
lawsuit.
justice
white
well,
you
could
be
more
specific...
and
you
were...
that
the
decree
had
to
do
with
the
old
jail.
justice
white
and
the
old
jail's
closed.
justice
white
so
the
decree
is
just
over.
and
you've
got
a
new
jail
that's
never
been
adjudicated.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
it
isn't...
it
isn't
if
the
consent
decree,
or
the
court,
thought
that
there
was
a
per
se
rule
against
double-bunking
in
any
prison.
justice
white
and
if
there
was
a...
if
that
element
was
in
the
decree,
why,
there's
been
a
changed
condition,
namely
that
the
law
has
been
changed.
if
it
was...
ever
was
that
law,
the
law's
been
changed.
justice
white
the
judge
says
to
the
parties
when
they
come
into
this
consent
decree,
the
judge
says
to
the
plaintiff,
look,
i
would
never
enter
an
order
like
this
if
we
litigated
this
case
and
you
won,
i
would
not
enter
this
order.
and
should
he
just
nevertheless
enter
the
consent
decree?
justice
white
you
say
that
the
double-celling
provisions
should
be
enforced
even
though
double-celling
per
se
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional?
justice
white
but
nevertheless,
the
consent
decree
should
be
enforced
without
even
considering
whether
or
not
the
conditions
in
the
new
jail
are
unconstitutional?
justice
white
that
is
right,
is
it
not?
justice
white
that
was
the
deal.
justice
white
but
you
did
not
know
who
was
going
to
win.
justice
white
well,
that's
a
deal.
that's
the
deal,
though.
that's
the
deal.
justice
white
well,
part
of
federal
law
is
that
you
don't
bind...
you
do
not
tell
a
state
how
to
run
its
business
unless
they're
trying
to
run
it
contrary
to
the
constitution.
justice
white
of
course,
all
the
government
has
to
do
is
build
another
jail
to
keep
up
with
the
prisoner
population.
justice
white
which
is
what
happened
because
of
the
case
that
was
brought.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
these
cases
is
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
and
decision
of
the
case.
