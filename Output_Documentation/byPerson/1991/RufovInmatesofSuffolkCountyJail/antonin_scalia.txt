justice
scalia
mr.
montgomery,
i
don't
really
understand
what
you're
saying.
this
wasn't
a
suit
against
the
jail;
it
was
a
suit
against...
against
the
government.
and
the
government's
still
there.
i
mean,
why
say
it's
a...
see,
it
wasn't
a...
the
jail
wasn't
being
sued.
the
government
was
being
sued.
the
government
had
been
doing
something
that
was
unconstitutional.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
suit.
and
these
people
say
the
government
is
still
doing
something
that
is
unconstitutional.
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it's
doing
it
in
one
building
or
another
building?
justice
scalia
your
answer
to
chief
justice
assumes
that
courts
can
take
account
of
character
evidence,
even
though
juries
may
not
be
able
to.
but
we're--
[laughter]
but
will...
but
let
it
go.
justice
scalia
do
you
agree
that
a
consent
decree
cannot
go
beyond
what
the
court
has
power
to...
order
without
the
consent
decree?
justice
scalia
it
can
go
beyond
remedying
the
constitutional
violations.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
authority
of
a
court
to
do
that,
to
order
something
that
is
not
necessary
to
prevent
a
violation
of
law?
justice
scalia
just
the
agreement
of
the
parties?
justice
scalia
so
the
court
converts
a
private
contract
into
a
rule
of
law?
justice
scalia
well,
sue
them
for
breach
of
contract.
i
mean,
could
you
not
get
some
monetary...
i
mean,
if
your
grievance
is
that
they
have
welshed
on
the
deal,
then
you
must
have
some
contractual
remedy.
but
it
is
a
little
different
saying
that
the
power
and
force
of
the
government
must
be
invoked
because
there
has
been
a
breach
of
contract.
justice
scalia
you
know
what
we
mean
by
enlarging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
mr.
stern.
we
mean
letting
the
court
do
something
it
does
not
have
power
to
do,
to
issue
a
decree
that
it
is
not
independently
empowered
to
issue
apart
from
this
contract
that
the
parties
have.
justice
scalia
and
your
answer
is?
justice
scalia
it
has
not.
justice
scalia
mr.
stern,
how
much
do
you
need
to
assure
that?
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
are
not
taking
the
position,
apparently...
i
don't
think
you
are...
that
the
court
can
put
into
the
decree
something
that
is
clearly
beyond
its
remedial
power.
you
said,
at
least
where
it
is
arguably
within
the
remedial
power.
that
is
really
all
you
are
grasping
for,
right?
justice
scalia
that's
all
you
need
in
this
case.
wouldn't
it
be
enough
to
assure
the
validity
of
consent
decrees
or
at
least
the
worthwhileness
of
entering
into
them
if
once
the
decree
is
entered,
the
burden
is
on
the
party
who
seeks
to
overturn
the
decree
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
violate
the
decree?
although
normally
the
burden
is
on
the
party
showing
the
constitutional
violation
to
prove
it.
once
you
enter
a
decree,
if
you
want
to
get
out
of
it,
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
to
do
what
you
want
to
do
in
violation
of
the
decree.
would
that
not
make
it
worthwhile
to
enter
into
decrees?
justice
scalia
on
close
questions
of
law,
as
you
are
saying.
the
things
have
to
be
arguably
within
the
court's
jurisdiction.
and
once
you
enter
the
consent
decree
you
have
it
locked
to
this
extent,
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
suddenly
shift
to
the
other
side
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
law.
justice
scalia
and
if
it
were
still
a
close
question
and
if
we
put
the
burden
on
the
side
trying
to
break
the
consent
decree
to
show
that
double
occupancy
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
that
would
normally
be
hard
to
show
if
it
was
still
a
close
question.
but
it
is
no
longer
even
a
close
question.
it
is
now
absolutely
clear
that
in
and
of
itself
it
is
not
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
constitutionally
required,
too?
i
mean,
it's
a
nice
idea,
but
can
you
require
a
state
to
do
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
make
it
a
constitutional
requirement
by
just
agreeing
to
do
it?
