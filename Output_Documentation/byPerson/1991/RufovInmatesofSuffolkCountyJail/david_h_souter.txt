justice
souter
you're
saying
that
once
the
consent
decree
has
been
complied
with
for
any
period
of
time,
that
ends
the
power
of
the
court
to
enforce
that
decree
except
insofar
as
a
change
may
fall
below
constitutional
standards.
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
souter
then
under
those...
under
your
rule,
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
changed
circumstance.
the
constitutional
violation
is
remedied,
and
you
can
walk
back
into
court
the
next
morning
and
say,
well
it's
true.
we
promised
by
the
consent
decree
to
do
something
more
than
the
constitution
requires,
but
we
now
are
under
no
obligation
to
do
so
and
the
court
can't
make
us
do
it.
that
reads
the...
that
reads
the
consensual
aspect
of
the
consent
decree,
in
effect,
right
out
of
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
souter
but
you're
saying
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
attempt
to
enforce
a
consent
decree
which
goes
beyond
constitutional
minima,
equitable
considerations
really
are
irrelevant?
justice
souter
no,
but
is
not
the
difference
that
they
could
waive
the
illegality?
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
they
can,
by
an
agreement,
enlarge
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
i
mean,
the
one
does
not
follow
from
the
other,
even
if
you
assume
that
the
particular
inmates
can
waive
the
consequently
declared
illegality.
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
they
can
enlarge
the
constitutional
jurisdiction
of
the
court
by
an
agreement.
