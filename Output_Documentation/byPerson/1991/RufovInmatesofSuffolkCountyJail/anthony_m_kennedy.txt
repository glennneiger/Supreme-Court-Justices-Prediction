justice
kennedy
is
that--
--would
you
agree
that
at
the
outset,
a
trial
court
has
the
authority
to
impose
on
the
state,
by
a
consent
decree,
an
obligation
that's
greater
than
the
constitution
commands?
justice
kennedy
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
the
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
say
i'll
do
no
more
than
the
constitutional
minimum?
justice
kennedy
i
mean
at
the
outset
of
the
decree.
suppose
the
court,
at
the
outset
of
the
decree,
said
i
will
enter
no
decree
that...
exceeds
the
constitutional
minimum.
justice
kennedy
under
your
view,
what
are
the
key
differences
between
a
consent
decree
and
a
judgment
after
litigation?
justice
kennedy
do
consent
decrees
serve
an
important
function
in
our
litigation
and
adversary
system?
justice
kennedy
well,
does
the
court
have
any
greater
authority
to
enter
relief
pursuant
to
a
consent
decree
than
pursuant
to
a
litigated
judgment?
justice
kennedy
the
mechanism
for
that
solution
as
a
practical
matter
really
had
to
be
a
consent
decree,
didn't
it?
as
a
practical
matter,
these
parties
could
not
have
gone
into
the
realm
of
private
contracts
and
had
a
contract
because
state
law
provisions
were
simply
too
restrictive,
i
take
it...
gift
of
public
funds,
binding...
subsequent
legislatires,
and
so
forth.
justice
kennedy
i
could
not
think
of
it
either.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
contract
analogy
does
not
help
you
very
much.
this
was
not
a
case
of
parties
who
had
a
choice
of
substituting
the
private
contractual
mechanism
for
the
court
mechanism.
the
court
mechanism
was
all
they
had.
and
if
that
is
so,
then
it
must
be
governed
by
rules
that
are
sue
generis
to
that
process,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
kennedy
was
there
any
length
or
term
of
years
on
this
consent
decree?
justice
kennedy
rule
against
perpetuity
or
something?
