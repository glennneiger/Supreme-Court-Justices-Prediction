chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
90-954,
robert
c.
rufo
v.
the
inmates
of
the
suffolk
county
jail,
and
90-1004,
thomas
c.
rapone
v.
the
inmates
of
the
suffolk
county
jail.
please
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
a
constitutional
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
janiak.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
montgomery.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if,
in
the
showing
in
the...
for
the
original
decree,
mr.
montgomery,
it
was
shown
that
this
sheriff
had
been
sheriff
of
three
or
four
different
jails,
and
in
every
one
of
them
he
double-celled.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
could
then
say,
indeed,
it
isn't
just
the
building
in
which
he's
in,
he
just
has
a
propensity
to
double-cell
people.
he's
apt
to
do
so
in
the
new
building,
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
montgomery.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
stern,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
he
applied
the
second
standard
somewhat
perfunctorily?
he
has
about
one
sentence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
think
one
can
say,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
judgment
for
damages
in
the
settlement,
no
difficulty
arises.
it
is
over
and
done
with.
but
if
you
are
talking
about
an
injunctive
decree
where
the
federal
court
is
involved
year
after
year,
surely
somewhat
different
considerations
prevail,
do
you
not
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
in
this
case
the
precise
same...
rather,
a
different
consent
decree
had
been
entered
saying
that
generally
speaking
double-celling
is
okay,
and
bell
v.
wolfish
and
rhodes
v.
chapman
had
come
out
differently
in
this
court
so
that
there
is
now
a
per
se
rule
against
double,
could
the
state
insist
that
it
can
continue
to
run
the
jail
under
that
decree?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
consent
decree
had
said
no
problem
with
double...
double-celling
as
a
general
rule.
and
then
bell
v.
wolfish
and
rhodes
v.
chapman
are
decided
by
this
court
the
opposite
way
than
they
were.
chief
justice
rehnquist
per
se
rule
against
doubling.
can
the
state
insist
under
the
consent
decree
that
it
will
continue
to
double-cell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
plead
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
would
be
bound
to
not
to
take
the
benefit
of
the...
our
hypothetical
ruling
that
single...
double-celling
is
prohibited.
do
you
agree
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stern.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-954,
rufo
against
the
inmates
of
suffolk
county
jail
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
