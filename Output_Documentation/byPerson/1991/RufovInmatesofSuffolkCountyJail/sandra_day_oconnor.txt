mr.
janiak,
do
you
plan
to
discuss
with
us
the
standard
employed
below
and
the
standard
that
you
employed
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
rule
60(b)(5)
have
anything
to
do
with
the
authority
of
the
court
to
consider
a
modification?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
rule
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
question
is
whether
it's
equitable,
basically.
justice
o'connor
okay.
justice
o'connor
does
a
consent
decree
have
any
contractual
aspects
to
it
that
are
the
source
of
special
concern?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
stern,
do
you
agree
with
the
application
of
the
so-called
swift
standard
by
the
lower
court
in
looking
at
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
might
have
a
problem
with
it
because--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i'm
not
sure
that
is
the
standard
that
ought
to
be
applied
in
cases
like
this.
