mr.
john
t.
montgomery
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
commissioner
of
corrections
agrees
with
the
sheriff
that
the
district
court
should
have
modified
the
consent
decree,
due
to
changed
circumstances.
but
we
maintain
that
there
is
another,
more
fundamental
basis
for
reversal
of
the
district
court.
we
submit
that
with
the
closing
of
the
old
jail
and
the
opening
of
the
new
jail,
it
was
no
longer
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
continue
to
exercise
equitable
authority
over
double-celling
under
the
consent
decree.
the
new
facility
contained
no
vestiges,
if
you
will,
of
the
unconstitutional
conditions
at
the
old
jail.
and
it
eliminated
any
risk
of
a
recurrence
of
the
conditions
that
offended
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
being
so,
under
the
general,
equitable
principles
applied
by
this
court
most
recently
in
board
of
education
v.
dowell,
last
term,
we
maintain
that
the
district
court
should
have
concluded
that
the
consent
decree's
restrictions
on
double-bunking
could
have
no
further,
prospective
application
under
rule
60(b)(5).
the
federal
court
had
played
its
role.
it
had
succeeded
in
fully
protecting
constitutional
values,
and
the
time
to
end
judicial
tutelage
over
this
jail
had
come
to
an
end.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
your
honor,
what
we're
saying
is
that
once
the
underlying
constitutional
violations
have
been
cured,
and
are
unlikely
to
recur,
at
that
point...
which
we
concede
is
difficult
to
define
in
many
cases...
the
power
of
the
court
ends,
no
matter
what
the
consent
decree
says.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
your
honor,
we
really
make
here...
in
this
case...
two
arguments.
we
agree
with
the
sheriff
that
there
are
circumstances
when
the
court
must
apply
equitable
principles
to
determine
whether
a
modification
is
appropriate
because
of
changed
circumstances.
but
we
speak
here,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
the
absolute
limits
that
we
think
this
court
should
impose
on
the
court's
equitable
authority.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
we
do
not
go
that
far,
your
honor.
if
the
parties
agree
to
a
consent
decree
that
is
entered
by
the
court
which
contains
an
element...
for
example,
in
this
case,
double-bunking...
which
purportedly
exceeds
constitutional
standards,
we
read
local
93
to
permit
the
court
to
enter
such
a
consent
decree
without
a
searching
inquiry
into
whether
every
single
provision
in
the
decree
falls
within
constitutional
standards.
until
there
are
changed
circumstances,
there
is
no
basis
for
a
modification.
beyond
that,
there
is
no
basis,
in
our
view,
for
the
argument
we
make
here,
that
is
that
the
equitable
authority
of
the
court
has
come
to
an
end
until
the
constitutional
violations
that
led
to
the
decree
have
been
cured...
and
a
showing
can
be
made
that
they
are
unlikely
to
recur.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
that's
right.
the
original
consent
decree,
however,
your
honor,
did
contemplate
the
construction
of
a
new
jail.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
indeed,
the
consent
decree,
and
its
hundreds
of
pages
of
attachments,
were
the
architectural
plan
for
the
new
jail.
but
we
agree,
that
once
the
new
jail
is
built,
that
the
essence
of
the
dispute
has
been
resolved.
and
all
of
the
constitutional--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--that's
true.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
court
thought
that--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
however,
the
original
consent
decree
does
not
contain
any
provision
which
suggests
that
the
court
believed
there
was
a
per
se
right
to
a
single
cell.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
your
honor,
the
question
is
the
context
on
which
the
assessment
is
made
of
whether
there
isn't...
some
violation
of
the
law
that
occurs.
we
maintain
that
the
court
below
ought
not
to
address
the
double-celling
question
under
the
consent
decree...
because,
as
i've
said,
the
limits
of
the
court's
equitable
authority
had
come
to
an
end...
but
rather,
as
a
fresh
complaint.
in
this
case,
the
inmates'
complaint
about
the
sheriff's
plan
to
double-cell
in
the
future,
is
like
the
student
reassignment
plan
in
dowell.
student
reassignment
was
an
integral
part
of
the
original
order
that
had
been
entered
by
the
court
in
dowell.
but
what
this
court
did
is
it
drew
a
line.
and
it
said
that
if
the
plaintiffs
cannot
show
that
there
are
remaining
vestiges
of
de
jures
discrimination,
and
cannot
show
that
there
is
now
threat
of
recurrence,
then...
or
excuse
me,
if
they
can
show
that,
then
the
student
reassignment
plan
can
be
challenged
only
under
a
fresh
complaint.
what
we
say
here
is
not
that
the
plaintiff
should
be
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
challenge
double-celling
at
the
new
jail,
but
that
they
should
do
so
only
on
a
fresh
complaint
and
under
the
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
if
the
court
had
believed,
in
1973
when
it
entered
its
original
decision
after
trial
that
single-celling
was,
per
se,
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
such
a
sheriff
were
a
party
to
the
case,
then
i
would
agree
with
your
honor's
suggestion
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
that
there
was
not
a
likelihood
of
recurrence.
but
if
the
court
looks
at
judge
garrity's
decision
in
1973,
it
is
clear
that
judge
garrity
was
very
complimentary
of
the
conduct
of
the
public
officials
in
this
case.
and
that
he
viewed
the
root
cause
of
the
constitutional
problems
here
to
be
the
building.
and
he
sought
to
bring
about
a
set
of
circumstances,
via
his
order
to
close
the
jail,
that
would
replace
that
building.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
i
suppose
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
it
is
the
case,
your
honor,
that
this
record
is,
frankly,
littered
with
compliments
by
the
district
court
for
the
conduct
of
the
public
officials.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
for
purposes
of
the
argument
that
we
make
concerning
the
limits
of
the
court's
authority,
there
is
no
difference
at
all,
in
our
view.
the
matter
of--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--they
serve
a
very
important
function.
but
consent,
your
honor,
does
not
expand...
we
do
not
believe...
the
equitable
power
of
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
standard
modification
context,
applying
principles
under
rule
60(b)(5)...
consent,
we
believe,
may
very
well
make
a
difference.
and
it
is
a
consideration
that
the
court
can
take
into
account
in
balancing--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--under
local
93,
there
certainly
is
an
argument
to
be
made
that
there
is
some
greater
authority
under
a
consent
decree
to
enter
relief.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
court's
treatment
of
general,
equitable
principles,
as
they
apply
to
both
litigated
and
consent
decrees,
that
would
permit
the
court
to
expand
its
ultimate
authority.
there
is
no
difference,
for
example,
between
the
equitable
principles
that
the
court
applied
in
dowell,
which
involved
a
litigated
decree,
and
pasadena
v.
spangler,
which
involved
a
consent
decree.
and
we
think
to
permit
the
parties
to
expand
the
ultimate
power
of
the
court,
by
virtue
of
consent,
runs
counter
to
the
principle
that
the
court...
i
believe
has
repeatedly...
reaffirmed
that
the
parties
may
not,
by
consent,
purchase
the
continuing
equitable
power
of
the
court.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
no,
i
believe
dowell
most
strongly
supports
our
position.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
we
see
no
difference
between
consent
decrees
and
litigated
decrees.
and
in
dowell,
the
court
concluded
that
the
limits
of
enforceability...
assuming
that
the
problems
had
been
cured,
the
limits
of
enforceability
had
been
reached
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
court's
power.
and
any
new
problems,
had
to
be
tested
under
a
fresh
complaint,
as
i
said
earlier.
and
we
believe
that
that
approach
applies
fully
here.
the
desegregation
context
is
one
in
which
the
court
has
had
the
most
sustained
opportunity,
over
the
last
20,
30
years
to
develop
the
application
of
equitable
principles.
and
we
believe
that
they
apply
fully
here.
we
believe
that
under
this...
these
circumstances,
this
is
a
case
for
the
court
to
confirm
in
a
context
other
than
desegregation,
that
judicial
orders,
including
consent
decrees
against
local
officials,
are
not
intended
to
operate
in
perpetuity.
we
are
asking
the
court
here
to
make
it
clear
that
when
the
past
violations
are
permanently
cured...
and
in
this
case
a
$54
million
building
permanently
cured
the
violations
that
led
to
so
many
years
of
litigation...
that
local
officials
will
now
be
held
accountable,
not
to
the
federal
courts,
but
to
the
democratic
process
within
their
communities.
this
consent
decree
gives
this
jail
a
special
status.
and
now
that
the
violations
have
been
cured,
all
of
the
old
violations,
the
connection,
the
critical
connection
between
the
violation
that
led
to
the
decree,
and
the
remedy,
has
become
unhinged.
and
when
that
happens,
the
decree
takes
on
a
life
of
its
own.
and
we
suggest
that
that
is
inappropriate.
and
that
is
a
proposition
that
the
court
should
not
permit
to
stand.
we
respectfully
request
that
the
court
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
modify
the
decree.
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
any
further
questions.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
i
thank
the
court.
