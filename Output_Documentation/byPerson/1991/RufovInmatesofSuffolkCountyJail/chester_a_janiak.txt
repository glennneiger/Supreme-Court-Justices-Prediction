mr.
chester
a.
janiak
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
standard
should
be
applied
to
modify...
to
resolve
a
disputed
request
to
modify
a
consent
decree
entered
into
by
a
public
official
defendant.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
a
consent
decree
in
such
a
case
should
be
modified
if
there
has
been
a
change
in
circumstance
since
the
entry
of
the
consent
degree
that
is
adversely
affecting
public
interests
or
important
public
institutions
and
if
the
consent
decree
may
be
modified
to
avoid
those
adverse
effects
and
still
vindicate
the
plaintiff's
federally
guaranteed
rights.
in
this
case,
the
courts
below
failed
to
apply
such
a
standard,
with
two
adverse
effects.
first,
the
sheriff
of
suffolk
county
has
been
compelled,
because
of
the
single-celling
provision
in
the
consent
decree
in
this
case,
to
transfer
inmates
from
the
brand-new
suffolk
county
jail,
which
was
opened
in
may
of
1990,
from
that
facility
into
a
state
correctional
system,
which
is
now
operating
at
excess
of
170
cent...
170
percent
of
capacity.
these
inmates
are
transferred
from
that
brand-new
facility
into
a
state
system,
where,
ironically,
they
are
often
double
or
triple-bunked
or,
in
some
instances,
compelled
to
sleep
on
the
floors
of
those
institutions.
these
transfers
are
made
pursuant
to
a
state
statute
which
requires
the
agreement
and
consent
of
the
sheriff
and
the
commissioner
of
correction
to
make
such
transfers.
these
transfers
would
not
be
made
by
the
sheriff
or
the
commissioner
of
correction
except
for
the
consent
decree
entered
in
this
case.
they...
the
sheriff
and
the
commissioner
of
correction
agree
that
they
are
not
correctionally
sound
and
have
interfered
with
the
operation
of
the
over-burdened
state
correctional
system
by
placing
additional
pre-trial
detainees
into
that
system;
and
in
addition,
it
required
suffolk
county
to
expend
an
additional
$1
million
a
year
in
transporting
inmates
from
the
suffolk
county
jail
to
these
state
correctional
facilities.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
we
could
compute.
the
record
doesn't
say
it
directly,
justice,
but
it
would
be
apparent
from
simply
taking
the
daily
count
statistics,
which
are
in
the
record,
and
we
know
what
the
capacity
was
at
the
facility...
you'd
have
a
given
point
in
time.
they
number,
literally,
at
this
point,
in
the
thousands.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
yes,
there
would
be...
there
would
be--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--they
most
probably
would
totally
eliminate
it.
because
what
we've
asked
for,
is
we
have...
in
the
new
facility,
which
opened
in
may
of
1990,
we
have
419
cells
for
male
inmates.
we've
asked
to
double-bunk
197
of
them.
given
our
count
statistics,
it
is
highly
unlikely
we
would
ever
exceed...
go
beyond
the
197
that
we
intend
to
double-bunk.
that
is,
our
counts
typically
have
been
lately
run...
typically
run
in
the
area
of
480
inmates,
where
we
have
only
419
cells.
there
are
occasions
where
we've
exceeded
500.
so
this
would
most
probably
result
in
a
complete
cure
of
this
problem.
the
second
adverse
effect,
the
keeping
this
consent
decree
in
place,
has
been
on
the
functioning
of
the
state
bail
statute.
there
are
occasions
where
the
sheriff
does
not
have
a
sufficient
number
of
inmates
who
qualify
for
transfer
to
a
state
correctional
facility.
because
under
state
law,
the
only
persons
who
may
be
transferred
are
pre-trial
detainees
who
have
served
a
prior
state
felony
sentence.
if
those
types
of
inmates
are
not
available,
and
the
sheriff
still
has
more
inmates
than
419
cells
at
the
jail,
what
he
must
do
is
then
submit
a
list
of
names
to
a
superior
court
judge.
and
the
superior
court
judge
then
takes
individuals
who
are
being
held
on
bail
and
reduces
them
to
release
on
recognizance,
so
that
they
may
be
transferred
to
a
half-way
house
facility,
which
is
an
insecure
facility,
whereas
the
jail
is
a
maximum
security
facility.
those
individuals,
the
record
shows,
10
to
15
percent
of
those
individuals
then
walk
away
from
that
facility.
these
persons
are
persons
who
at
least
one
judge
of
the
courts
in
suffolk
county...
and
in
most
instances
two
judges...
have
adjudicated
as
persons
for
whom
the
setting
of
bail
is
necessary
to
ensure
their
appearance
at
trial.
this
is
a
second
adverse
effect
of
the
court's
decision
below
because
it
is
now
interfering
with
the
functioning
of
the
state
bail
statute
in
having
individuals
released
on
recognizance
who
would
not
otherwise
qualify
for
that
status.
it
is
these
interferences
with
the
administration
of
the
state
correctional
system,
the
county
pre-trial
detention
system,
and
the
state
bail
statute
that
the
sheriff
sought
to
avoid
in
this
case
when
he
proposed
to
double-bunk
197
of
the
400...
197
of
the
435
cells
at
the
suffolk
county
jail.
the
remainder
of
those
cells,
34
of
them
are
for
female
detainees.
when
the
sheriff
made
that
proposal,
he
proposed
to...
leave
in
place,
all
of
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
consent
decree.
the
consent
decree
in
this
case
provided
for
the
construction
of
a
jail
which
far
exceeds
constitutional
requirements.
and
although
the
sheriff
proposed
to
double-bunk,
none
of
the
other
features
of
the
consent
decree
would
be
disturbed
by
the
sheriff's
proposal
for
modification.
for
example,
there
are
outdoor
recreation
areas
which
would
have
been
left
intact,
indoor
recreation
areas,
contact
visiting
areas.
specialized
cells
would
not
be
double-bunked.
any
of
the
specialized
cells
in
this
facility
would
remain
for
those
purposes...
that
is,
infirmary
cells,
psychiatric
cells,
suicide-prevention
cells.
none
of
the
other
architectural
feature,
or
other
features
of
the
facility
would
be
altered,
except
for
double-bunking
197
of
the
cells.
furthermore,
the
sheriff's
proposal
to
the
district
court
would
have
required
that
individuals
who
are
double-bunked
are
only
those
individuals
who
would
have
qualified
as
eligible
for
double-bunking
under
the
classification
program
of
the
national
sheriffs
association,
which
in
this
case,
was
further
reviewed
and
approved
by
an
accredited
auditor
of
the
american
correctional
association.
and
it
was
this
proposal
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
and
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
below.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
the
old
facility--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--the
smallest-sized
cell
in
the
new
facility
is...
the
minimum-sized
cell
in
the
new
facility
is
70
square
feet.
in
the
old
facility,
which
was
also
single-cell
by
court
order,
the
cells
were,
i
believe,
80
square
feet,
or
88
square
feet.
they
were
larger.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
in
some
instances,
in
the
small,
minimum-sized
cells
of
70
square
feet,
there
would
be
double-bunking.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
the
cells
in
the
new
facility--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--the
cells
in
the
new
facility
would
be,
in
some
instances,
would
be
smaller
than
the
cells
in
the
old
facility.
however,
the
new
facility
differs
very
significantly
in
other
features
of
the
design
of
the
jail.
the
new
jail,
for
example,
has
only
small,
modular
units,
so
that
in
any
unit,
there
is
no
more
than
40
cells,
stacked
in
2
tiers.
and
available
to
the
inmates
in
that
unit
is
a
large,
common,
day
room.
so
that
in
the
new
facility...
although
some
inmates
would
be
double-bunked,
they
would
be
out
of
their
cells--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--correct.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
that's...
the
judge
below
said
he
did
not
have
to
reach
any
issue,
and
there
are
no
findings.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
the...
perhaps
the
most
appropriate
result,
then,
would
be
to
remand
to
apply
a
new
standard
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
double-bunking
this
particular
facility--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--would
meet
constitutional
standards.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
yes,
justice
o'connor.
below,
what
the
district
court
judge
did
was,
first,
apply
the
standard
in
swift.
after
having
found
that
this
case
did
not
meet
the
standard
in
swift,
the
district
court
judge
then
purported
to
apply
what
he
said
was
a
flexible
standard.
but
we
submit
that
in
fact,
what
the
judge
applied
was
a
new
standard,
which
is
quite
unlike
both
the
standard
that
we've
urged
on
this
court,
and
unlike
the
standard
that's
been
applied
by...
in
the
various
circuit
courts.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
the
issue
would
be,
given
the
language
of
that
rule,
what--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--yes.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
the
question
is
what
does
equitable
mean
in
this
particular
kind
of
case.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
and
the
district
court
judge
first
looked
to
the
swift
case
in
answering
that,
which
i
submit
is
not
the
proper
standard,
given
this
court's
decision
in
the
dowell
case,
particularly,
and
then
went
on
to
apply
what
he
said
was,
quote,
"a
flexible
standard".
but
i
submit
that
what
he,
in
fact,
did
in
that
case
was
quite
different,
both
from
the
standard
that
we
have
urged
on
this
court,
and
quite
different
from
what
any
of
the
circuit
courts
have
done,
who've
spoken
of
a
flexible
standard.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
that
a
consent
decree
has
a
contractual
aspect
to
it,
but
it
should
not
be
considered
a
contract.
i
think
at
least
since
this...
justice
cardozo's
decision
in
the
swift
case,
he
says
that
although
a
consent...
a
consent
decree
is
an
order
of
the
court
and,
therefore,
is
subject
to
later
modification,
under
the
right
circumstance...
leaving
open
the
question
of
what
that
would
be,
given
the
nature
of
this
case.
with
respect
to
there
being
some
consensual
aspect
to
it,
i
think
that's
accommodated
by
the
standard
that
we've
urged
on
this
court.
because
what...
because
what
we
have
said
is
that
there
must
be
a
change
in
circumstance,
producing
an
adverse
effect.
and
by
saying
that
there
must
be
a
change
in
circumstance,
and
that
must
be
shown,
a
public
official
defendant
cannot
then
go
back
and
simply
say
i've
changed
my
mind.
so
i
think
that
our
proposal
accommodates
the
consensual
aspect
of
consent
decrees.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think,
given
this
court's
holding
in
the
local
93
case,
that
is
probably
correct,
that
they
would
have...
if
the
parties
agree
to
it,
and
it
goes
beyond
what
the
court
could
have
ordered
after
trial,
it
may
be
entered
as
a
consent
decree.
i
think
that
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
a
different
issue,
which
is
given
that
that
has
happened,
what...
what
is
the
standard
to
be
applied
later,
when
the
parties
come
back
before
the
court,
and
there's
a
disputed
request
to
modify
a
consent
decree.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
that...
in
fact,
what
the
court
would
be
required
to
do
is
to
look
to
the
underlying
federal
law
which
occasion
the
court's
original
intervention--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--i
believe
that
the
court
would
have
that
discretion.
and
that--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--well,
i
think
that's
a
tough
question,
given
this
court's...
and
which...
i'm
sure
that's
why
it
was
asked,
justice
white.
i
think
that's
a
difficult
question,
given
it's...
it
is
my
understanding
of
this
court's
decision
in
local
93,
where
there
was
a
decree
entered
which
went
beyond
what
the
court
could
have
ordered
in
that
case.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
that
was
not
a
constitutional
case.
that
was
a
title
vii
case.
it
may
be
that
a
constitutional
case
presents
a
somewhat
different
issue.
what
we've
urged--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--that's
correct.
there
has
to
be
some
federal
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
or
federal
law,
which
brought
the
parties
before
the
court
initially.
then
the
question
is,
does
the
consent
decree
contain
remedies
go
beyond
the
minimum...
go
beyond
what
is
required
in
order
to
vindicate
those
federally
guaranteed
rights.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
i
think
my...
in
my
view,
they
don't
have
to
be
foreseeable.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
well,
what
the
district
court
judge
did
here,
justice
stevens,
he
looked...
he
discussed
the
issue
of
foreseeability
only
in
the
context
of
applying
the
swift
standard.
and
then
i
think
discuss...
applied
a
standard
which
is
really
different
than
any
foreseeability
standard
to
which
any
public
official
should
be
held.
because
what
he
did
is
he
conceded,
initially,
that
the
phenomenon
of
increases
in
jail
and
prison
populations
are
unpredictable.
having
conceded
that
he
was
dealing
with
an
unpredictable
phenomenon,
he
then
spoke
of
what
was
at...
what
he
found
to
be
an
apparent
trend,
looking
back
in
april
of
1990,
to
1985.
and
on
that
basis,
said,
well,
it
wasn't
unforeseen.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very,
tight
standard
to
hold
any
public
official
to.
you
tell
me
that
you're
going
to
talk
about
apparent
trends
with
respect
to
unpredictable
phenomena.
and
if
you
don't
foresee
this
coming,
then
i'm
going
to
hold
you
to
the
original
agreement.
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
that
is...
that
any
time,
if
there
was
a
change
in
circumstance,
which
led
to
a
further
increase--
mr.
chester
a.
janiak
--foreseen
or
unforeseen,
then
you
would
have
to
make
a
showing
that
that
was
a
change
in
circumstance,
and
had
an
adverse
affect.
but
you
would
also
always
have
to
show
that
the
modification
that's
requested
would
ensure
that
the
constitutional
rights
are
being
protected.
