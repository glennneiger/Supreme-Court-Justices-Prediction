justice
antonin
scalia
justice
black
was
sort
of
a
literalist.
he
hung
on
the
literal
meaning
of
words
a
lot.
nobody
here
that
does
that.
nobody
does
that
anymore.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
remedial
goals
of
the
legislation
include
the
use
of
the
word
employee,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ragsdale,
you
assert
in
your
brief
that
one
reason
we
should
agree
with
you
is
that
the...
is
that
the
test
proposed
by
the
fourth
circuit
will
be
very
confusing
and
difficult
to
apply.
do
you
really
think
it's
going
to
be
any
more
difficult
to
apply
than
the
common
law
employee
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
latter
is
venerable
confusion,
but
it's
still
confusion,
nonetheless,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i...
i
thought
you'd
finished
that
thought.
as
i
understand
it,
although
mr.
ragsdale
doesn't
seem
to
think
so,
i
took
your
brief
to
differ
a
little
bit
from...
and
the
government's
position
to
differ
a
bit
from
his
in
that
he
would
rely
upon
the
common
law
test
and
the
government
apparently
would
rely
primarily
on
the
common
law
test
but
not
exclusively.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
add
to
the
common
law
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
the
fact
that
nobody
knows
how
it
makes
any
difference,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
strong
argument.
but
if
congress,
like
mr.
ragsdale,
has
never
been
able
to
find
any
instance
in
which
it
made
a
dime's
worth
of
difference,
why
would
they
go
to
the
trouble
of
amending
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that?
i
mean,
the
remedial
purposes
of
erisa
include
limiting
erisa
to
employees.
it
seems
to
me
real
bootstrapping
to
say,
well,
since
you
consult
the
remedial
purposes
of
erisa,
and
those
remedial
purposes
are
limited
to
employees.
and
therefore,
for
some
reason
we
should
expand
the
meaning
of
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
what
the
rule
means:
in
a
close
case
they
are
employees
and
are
covered.
is
that
what
the
broad
remedial
purposes
thing
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
terms
of
their
employment
are
different?
i
don't
understand.
all
debit
agents
have
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
taking
into
account
the
broad
remedial
purposes
of
the
statute
means
finding
to
be
employees
those
who
need
the
money.
is
that
what
it
comes
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
also
said
in
his
brief,
and
he
said
here,
that
while
those
courts
have
avoided
the
erroneous
path
taken
by
the
court
below,
it
is
unclear
whether
they
are
giving
appropriate
weight
to
this
court's
decisions
involving
remedial
social
legislation,
such
as
rutherford
food,
et
cetera.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
like
to
view
that
as
congress
just
amending
the
law,
mr.
ragsdale.
i
don't
know
that
it
proves
the
court
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
court
properly
interpreted
the
previous
national
labor
relations
act
and
congress
enacted
a
new
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
even
a
different
congress
from
the
one
that
passed
the
original
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
doesn't
affect
how
you
should
construe
the
old
act.
