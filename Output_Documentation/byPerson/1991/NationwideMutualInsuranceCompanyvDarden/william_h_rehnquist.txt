we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1802,
nationwide
mutual
insurance
company
v.
robert
darden.
mr.
ragsdale,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ragsdale.
mr.
wright,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wright,
is
the
rutherford
food
case,
is
that
from
the
same
era
and
vintage
as
the
hearst
case,
which
was
overruled
by
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
overruled
rutherford?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
follin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
are
not
these
other
physical
properties
that
he
owns
also
assets?
perhaps
not
as
important
or
not
as...
worth
as
much,
but
they're
certainly
assets.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
is
consistent
with
rutherford
food?
they
only
cite,
as
i
read
their
opinion,
the
two
cases
that
congress
overruled.
they
never
cited
rutherford
foods.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
rutherford
food
is
much
closer
to
endorsing
the
common
law
test
than
hearst
or
silk
were,
i
think.
don't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
rutherford
food?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
would
you
still
feel
that
rutherford
was
controlling
in
the
interpretation
of
the
erisa
definition
of
employee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
if
the
erisa
did
not
carry
over
the
full
definition
of
employee
from
the
flsa
and
the
court
in
rutherford
relied
in
part
in
its
determination
on
the
part
that
was
not
carried
over
into
erisa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
statute
isn't
remedial,
mr.
follin?
all
statutes
are
presumably
passed
to
remedy
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
supposing
there's
a
sweeping
overhaul
to
the
government.
the
congress
says
too
many
people
have
been
avoiding
their
taxes
and
we're
going
to
do
something
to
remedy
this.
we're
going
to
really
clamp
down.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
broad
remedial
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
only
statutes
designed
to
help
people
in
economic
difficulty
should
be
broadly
construed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
you
wouldn't
look
to
silk
or
to
hearst
where
congress
overruled
the
holdings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
i
agree
with
that.
but
certainly
you
would
not
look
to
the
hearst
case
after
congress
said
we
don't
want
that
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
you
do
that
if
congress
later
overruled
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
think
the
word
compare
in
a
subsequent
case
is
necessarily
an
approving
citation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
opinion
said
he
didn't
meet
the
common
law
definition,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
follin.
mr.
ragsdale,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ragsdale,
i
notice
in
your
opening...
in
your
brief,
you
managed
to
find
the
hearst
case,
which
dealt
with
the
nlrb,
and
the
silk
case,
which
dealt
with
social
security,
but
you
didn't
manage
to
find
the
rutherford
food
case,
which
dealt
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
is
there
any
reason
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't
listed
in
your
table
of
authorities.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
ever
discuss
it--
--the
reply
brief
does
discuss
it.
well,
you
did
discuss
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ragsdale.
the
case
is
submitted.
