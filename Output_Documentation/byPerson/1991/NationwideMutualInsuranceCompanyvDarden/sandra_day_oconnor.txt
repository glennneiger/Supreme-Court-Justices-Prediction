justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ragsdale,
the
solicitor
general,
whose
representative
will
be
speaking,
i
guess,
this
morning,
suggests
that
the
common
law
test
should
be
applied
with
an
eye
to
the
remedial
goals
of
the
legislation.
and
in
what
ways
do
you
agree
with
that
and
in
what
ways
would
the
remedial
goals
of
erisa
apply,
do
you
think,
to
affect
the
common
law
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
follin,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you're
saying
we
should
look
to
the
same
definition
and
test
as
the
court
did
in
rutherford
food
under
a
statute,
a
different
statute
with
similar
language.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
was
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general.
and
in
his
view,
then
that
leads
to
a
reversal
here,
because
it
wouldn't
include
an
independent
contractor
such
as
your
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
want
to
be
clear
as
to
what
your
argument
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
i'm
hearing
you
as
i
think
i
am,
you
are
saying
exactly
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying
is
the
test,
but
you
come
out
differently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
agreement
also
provided
that
if
the
agency
were
terminated
and
the
agent
then
went
into
competition
within
a
25-mile
radius,
that
the
benefits
would
be
lost.
