mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
whether
an
insurance
agent,
mr.
darden,
initially
found
by
district
judge
boyle
to
be
an
independent
contractor,
was
instead
and
employee
of
nationwide
for
purposes
of
erisa.
if
mr.
darden
was
not
an
employee,
the
provisions
of
erisa
did
not
apply
to
him.
thus,
the
case
turns
upon
the
proper
definition
of
employee.
we
have
been
here
before.
this
is
a
revisitation
in
an
erisa--
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
--pardon
me?
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
justice
white,
i
know
you
have
been
here,
because
you
were
a
member
of
the
court
which
decided
united
insurance
company.
this
is
a
revisitation
in
an
erisa
context
of
identical
issues
which
have
already
been
decided
in
favor
of
the
position
which
both
nationwide
and
the
government
assert
today.
the
background
of
history
is
that
congress
enacted
both
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
social
security
act
by
making
them
applicable
to
employees.
and
by
using
that
word,
standing
alone,
without
more,
as
here.
and
in
the
forties,
this
court,
in
hearst
and
silk
and
bartels,
decided
that
it
would
conceive
a
definition
of
the
word
employee
different
from
that
which
congress
intended.
and
congress
repudiated
those
three
decisions
and
asserted
what
the
senate
committee
called
the
unbroken
intention
of
congress
to
insist
upon
the
application
of
the
common
law
of
agency
in
determining
who
was
and
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
class
of
employees.
after
the
confrontation
between
congress
and
the
court
was
resolved,
the
litigation
began
anew.
in
1962,
the
court
decided
a
social
security
case
in
enochs,
applied
the
principles
of
the
common
law
of
agency.
and
then
in
1968,
when
justice
white
was
here,
it
decided
united
insurance.
and
the
writer
of
that
decision,
justice
black,
said
these
word,
which
i
thought
were
profound,
and
i
want
to
repeat
the
court
this
morning.
he
said,
in
trying
to
determine
who
was
a
member
of
the
class
of
employees
in
a
labor
act
case,
there
is
no
doubt,
he
said,
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
should
apply
the
common
law
agency
test
here
in
distinguishing
an
employee
from
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
two
terms
ago,
justice
scalia,
justice
marshall,
writing
for
a
unanimous
court
in
reid,
and
citing
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
to
1915,
said:
in
the
past,
when
congress
has
used
the
term
employee
without
defining
it,
as
it
did
here
in
erisa,
we
have
concluded
that
congress
intends
to
describe
the
conventional
master-servant
relationship
as
understood
by
common
law
agency
doctrine.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
justice
o'connor,
he
discusses
it,
but
he
does
not
propose
it.
mr.
darden
wishes
it,
but
he
cannot
demonstrate
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of...
and
i've
looked
hard
because
i
thought
somebody
would
ask
me...
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of
which
has
ever
turned
and
been
made
distinct
by
applying
the
common
law
principles
of
agency,
and
then
twisting
it
one
ratchet
to
make
it
by
considering
the
remedial
goals
of
erisa,
or
the
labor
act,
or
the
social
security
act,
to
make
it
come
out
different.
only
one
court
that
i
know
of
has
gone
through
the
exercise
of
considering
it,
and
that
was
the
district
court
in
harlow,
cited
in
our
brief.
judge
kobrines
went
through
the
exercise,
and
when
he
got
through
he
decided
that
it
made
no
difference
to
the
outcome
of
the
case.
my
answer
is
that
it
cannot
be
demonstrated
that
a
consideration
of
the
remedial
goals
of
the
legislation
will
give
a
different
result
than
that
which
is
obtained
by
the
application
of
the
principles
of
the
common
law,
and
anyway--
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
--that
was
what
was
coming
after
anyway.
and
anyway,
that
was
the
word
congress
chose
to
achieve
the
remedial
goals
of
the
legislation,
to
extend
valuable,
enormously
important
benefits
to
a
segmented
group
of
the
work
force,
employees,
who
are
the
same
focus
as
in
the
labor
act,
who
are
the
same
focus
as
in
the
social
security
act.
but
there
is
a
line,
and
the
line
ends
with
employees,
and
it
does
not
extend
to
every
person
in
the
united
states
who
works.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
i
do.
i
do,
justice
scalia.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the--
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
--it
would
seem
to
me
that
what
i
call
the
darden
test,
the
test
articulated
and
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit,
is
dependent
in
every
case
upon
the
personal
desires
of
the
individual.
did
he
or
did
he
not
rely
upon
the
affirmations
or
whatever
were
made
to
him?
what
does
he
expect,
if
anything?
does
his
investment
behavior
change
as
he
goes
through
his
life
span?
does
he
forego
the
means
of
making
other
investments
to
provide
for
his
retirement?
how
can
anyone
possibly
know
that
unless
every
year
a
plan
administrator
sends
out
a
questionnaire
to
everybody
in
the
united
states
who
is
covered
by
a
plan?
it
is
a
subjective,
unprincipled
test
which
cannot
be
determined
by...
objectively
in
advance.
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it
will
cause
great
confusion,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
mr.
wright
is
here
this
morning
to
argue
for
the
department
of
labor
and
the
department
of
treasury,
and
urge
the
court
not
to
adopt
the
darden
test,
but
indeed
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
they
do,
justice
kennedy,
because
if
they
do
not,
an
employer...
let's
take
a
big
employer,
any
big
employer.
general
motors
needs
to
know
whose
in
their
plan
because
they
need
to
know
if
they've
got
enough
money
in
their
plan
to
take
care
of
whoever
is
in
it.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
if
i
understand
your
honor,
they
do
need
to
know
who
is
covered
by
erisa
and
who
is
not
because
their
plan
must
be
funded
to
provide
for
those
who
are.
and
it
need
not
be
funded
for
those
who
are
not.
two
years...
two
terms
ago,
in
reid,
the
court
unanimously
applied
the
common
law
of
agency,
declaring
that
the
correct
test
is
the
right
of
the
hiring
party
to
control
the
manner
and
means
of
rendering
service.
judge
boyle,
the
district
court
judge
who
granted
summary
judgment...
unlike
mr.
finley,
i
lost,
but
i
should
have
won...
judge
boyle
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
nationwide
in
the
first
place.
and
he
applied
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
united
insurance,
quoting
from
it,
assessing
the
total
factual
context
in
light
of
what
that
court
called
the
pertinent
common
law
agency
principles.
he
applied
14
detailed
and
undisputed
common
law
factors,
and
decided
that
mr.
darden
was
an
independent
contractor.
those
pertinent
common
law
factors
are
essentially
the
same
as
those
identified
and
applied
4
years
later
and
two
terms
ago
by
this
court
in
reid.
mr.
darden
appears
to
suggest
that
the
common
law
of
agency
is
the
natural
enemy
of
erisa.
quite
the
contrary.
federal
courts,
particularly
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
have
twice
applied
the
common
law
of
agency
in
erisa
cases,
in
erisa
cases,
and
found
in
favor
of
the
employee,
not
against
the
employee.
it
is
a
fallacy
to
presume
that
the
common
law
of
agency
always
works
a
bad
result.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
not
much
time
because
my
argument
is
bifurcated.
such
time
as
i
do
have
left,
i
respectfully
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
further
responding
to
justice
o'connor,
let
me
say
this.
i
said
that
the
solicitor
general
discussed
this
other
kind
of
test,
but
that
he
did
not
propose
it.
i
have
to
stand
by
that.
and
here
is
what
he
said.
and
i
stand
by
this
is
what
he
said.
he
said
the
district
court's
initial
decision
applied
the
proper
test
and
reached
the
correct
result.
that
is
indistinguishable
from
the
position
now
taken
by
nationwide
and
by
me.
he
said,
in
our
view,
the
district
court
approached
this
case
properly
and
reached
the
correct
result
in
its
initial
decision.
i
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
solicitor
general
on
that
statement.
he
said,
the
construction
of
employee,
also
this
construction...
that
is
the
common
law
construction...
also
conforms
to
congressional
use
of
that
term
in
other
context.
and
he
said:
the
result
reached
by
judge
boyle
is
also
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
erisa.
whatever
else
he
may
have
discussed,
that
is
what
he
proposes.
it
is
identical
to
that
which
nationwide
now
proposes.
justice
white
has
held
up--
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
--i
concede
that
he
discussed
it,
as
he
should,
but
he
does
not
propose
it
here.
justice
white
has
held
up
to
the
true
light
the
problem
created
by
this
rutherford
foods
case.
and
that
is,
he
has
gone
over
an
looked
at
the
verb,
not
the
noun
employee,
but
he
found
the
right
answer.
and
he
found
congressional
history
in
the
verb
to
employ.
because
in
that
act,
that
verb
had
a
different
meaning
than
it
does
here.
and
it
was
to
suffer
or
permit
to
work.
and
he
is
correct.
that
was
born
of
the
child
labor
laws,
where
in
this
country
at
that
time,
apparently
many
little
children
were
either
being
made
to
work
or
permitted
to
work,
and
congress
wanted
to
see
that
(a)
they
weren't
allowed
to
if
they
weren't
supposed
to,
and
(b)
if
they
were,
they
had
to
be
paid
a
fair
wage.
and
so
there
is
congressional
history
wrapped
in
another
word
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
and
that
is
in
part
a
justification
for
perhaps
a
different
view
and
a
different
treatment.
in
addition,
and
i'm
not
defending
this,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
certain
quagmires,
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
more
congressional
history,
which
is
that
senator
black
is
quoted
of
the
floor
of
the
senate
as
having
said
that
the
word
employee
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
should
be,
was
meant
to
be,
and
would
be
accorded
the
broadest
possible
use
of
that
term.
now,
if
that's
legislative
history,
and
i
don't
want
to
argue
about
it,
it
is
not
in
erisa.
there
is
nothing
similar
to
that
in
erisa.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court,
finding
itself
here
in
erisa,
between
the
labor
act
and
social
security
act
cases,
which
congress
has
declared
itself
on,
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
over
here,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
veer
from
its
path
and
go
with
the
fair
labor
standards
act
definition.
now,
mr.
follin,
my
good
friend
mr.
follin...
he
and
i
have
labored
in
this
case
for
10
wonderful
years.
he's
a
fine,
wonderful
lawyer
and
a
good
friend.
but
he
urges
this
court
to
do
exactly
what
the
plaintiff's
lawyers
in
the
hearst
case
must
have
urged
the
court
to
do.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
i
didn't
find
it?
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
we
don't
believe
it
is
authoritative
for
these
circumstances,
and
should
not
be
followed
in
this
case.
and
we
do
not
cite
it
to
the
court
as
the
true
path
to
take.
others
do,
but
we
do
not.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
yes.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
yes.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
we
discussed
it.
we
know
it
exists.
we
do
not
deny
that
it
has
been
decided.
we
say
that
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
circumstances
before
the
court
this
morning.
they
are
different.
now,
mr.
follin
is
doing
what
the
plaintiff's
lawyers
probably
did
in
the
hearst
case,
which
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
please
focus
your
gaze
upon
the
history,
terms,
and
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
that
is
exactly
what
mr.
follin
is
saying
this
morning.
focus
on
the
purposes
of
erisa.
when
the
hearst
court
focused
on
the
history,
terms,
and
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
threw
the
common
law
test
of
agency
over
the
side,
congress
repudiated
the
decision,
amended
the
act,
and
said,
don't
do
that
any
more.
that
is
why
i
say
we
are
revisiting
here
this
morning
that
which
has
already
occurred
in
the
past,
just
in
another
context.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
no,
i
didn't
say
the
court
was
wrong.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of--
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
--i
take
that
point,
and
i
concede
it.
i
don't
think
it
is
a
matter
of
right
and
wrong,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
discerning
the
congressional
intent
and
focusing
on
it.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
maybe.
mr.
george
r.
ragsdale
well,
your
honor,
the
decisions
of
the
united...
the
decision
of
united
insurance
was
7
years
on
the
books
before
erisa
was
enacted.
we
have
a
long
history
of
congressional
purpose
and
intent
in
my
two
favorite
colors.
and
congress
could
read
those.
and
they
knew
united
insurance
was
there
where
the
court
said
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
must
apply
these
common
law
principles.
and
they
enacted
erisa
in
the
face
of
that--
and
congress
must
have
known
that
this
court
now
felt
that
way
about
it
and
would
apply
and
insist
upon
the
application
of
those
principles
in
erisa.
otherwise
they
would
have
corrected
a
forthcoming
misapprehension
by
the
courts,
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
and
fixed
it
before
it
was
broken.
but
they
did
not
do
that.
and
they
have
not
done
that.
and
it
must
be
the
intention
and
desire
of
congress
for
the
common
law
test
of
agency
to
be
used
in
this
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much.
