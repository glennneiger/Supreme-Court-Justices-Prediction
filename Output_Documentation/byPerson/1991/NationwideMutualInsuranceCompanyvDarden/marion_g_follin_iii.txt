mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
respondent
robert
darden.
i
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
in
mr.
darden's
favor,
allowing
him
to
receive
his
retirement
benefits.
i'd
like
to
discuss
for
just
a
second
the
history
of
these
events
of
the
statutes...
the
way
one
could
look
at
them.
the
three
cases
that
held
that
a
broad
remedial
social
legislation,
such
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
social
security
act,
should
be
construed
in
a
manner
to
reflect
the
broad
remedial
purposes
of
the
statute,
not
just
use
the
common
law
test,
all
took
place
in
the
1940's.
three...
two
of
those
decisions
are
the
ones,
hearst
and
u.s.
v.
silk.
hearst
case
affected
the
national
labor
relations
act.
u.s.
v.
silk
interpreted
the
social
security
act.
congress,
in
about
1947
or
'48
came
back
and
amended
the
social
security
act,
and
also
amended
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
specify
that
the
term
employee
in
those
acts
was
to
be
construed
using
the
common
law
interpretation,
the
common
law
agency
interpretation.
now
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
is
interpreted
in
the
rutherford
food
corporation
case
in
about
1947,
'46,
has
never
been
amended
as
far
as
i
know.
that
definition,
statutory
definition,
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
statutory
definition
of
employee
which
is
contained
in
erisa.
so
that
if
you
look
at
the
state
of
the
law
in
1974,
and
that
congress
had
before
it
when
they
adopted
erisa,
they
knew
that
if
they
wanted
to
restrict
the
term
employee
to
a
common
law
meaning,
they
could
write
it
in
there
like
they
had
done
before
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
social
security
act.
they
could
do
it
if
they
wanted.
maybe
they
never
thought
about
it,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
adopted
the
same
interpretation
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
they
knew
when
they
did
that
that
the
rutherford
food
corporation
was
still
the
law
of
the
land,
and
is
somewhat
vague
and
difficult
to
understand
as
it
was.
one
could
reasonably
assume
they
knew
they
were
adopting
the
statute,
like
the
department
of
labor
says,
was
a
broad,
remedial
social
statute.
and
they
also
must
have
known
the
same
time
that
under
the
rutherford
food
corporation,
the
courts...
the
courts
would
look
to
the
purposes
of
erisa
in
interpreting
the
term
employee
and
they
wouldn't
be
bound
solely
by
the
common
law.
so
that
our
argument
is
that
you
are
writing
a
slightly
more
open
book.
and
i
add
one
other...
one
other
fact
to
it.
that
in
1961,
this
court,
in
goldberg
v.
whitaker,
held
in
a
case
involving
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
that
some
people
who
did
some
work
at
home
in
the
crocheting
field
were
employees.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
repeated
the
ruling
of
the
prior
holdings
that
they'd
done
in
rutherford
food
and
the
hearst
case
by
saying
that
the
court
was
not
bound
by
the
technical
concepts
of
the
common
law,
but
would
look
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
use
a
definition
based
on
the
economic
realities
of
the
situation.
that
was
in
1961.
so
the
court
did
that
in
'61.
congress
would
have
had
that
opinion
before
then,
in
1974,
when
they
enacted
erisa.
it
was
not
clear...
i
mean,
i'm
not
contending
that
one
can
say
exactly
what
congress
intended,
but
you've
got
to
assume
congress...
or
recently--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--well,
that
would
be
one
way
to
look
at
it.
let
me
be
more
specific
exactly--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--well,
what
i'm
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
focus
on
the
purposes
of
erisa.
and
whether
you
phrase
it
as
using
the
darden
test
standing
by
itself,
or
whether
you
take
the
darden
test
or
some
of
the
factors
that
arise
from
erisa
and
combine
it
in
some
fashion
with
the
common
law
test,
like
it
looked
like
the
court
did
in
rutherford
food.
there's
a
series
of
cases
where
courts
have
done
different
things.
i
just...
each
statute's
somewhat
different.
fair
labor
standards
act,
some
of
the
circuit
courts
have--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--yes.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
no,
i
don't
say
exactly
the
same
as
the
solicitor
general.
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
broad
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute.
that
is,
that
these
common
law
factors
are
not
sufficient
alone.
where
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
is
how
i
do
it.
that
is,
how
you
go
about
doing
this.
there
is
a
way
to
do
it.
the
fourth
circuit
has
provided
a
guideline
and
a
method
to
do
it.
if
i
could
just
give
an
example
to
the
way
i
come
out
differently
than
he
would
on
his
test.
for
example,
one
of
the
common
law
indicia
that's
listed
in
those
lists
of
things
you
see
in
the
restatement
of
agency,
is
whether
the
person
involved
owns
his
own
tools
or
instruments
of
trade.
that's
a
throwback,
obviously
to
something
a
long
time
ago
when
people...
when
this
thing
first
came
up.
in
this
case,
mr.
darden
owned
the
building.
he
also
owned
his
car.
he
owned
the
typewriters
and
desk
inside
his
office.
so
in
a
way,
he
looks
like
an
independent
contractor
under
the
common
law
test.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
business
he
was
in,
which
was
selling
insurance,
he
did
not
own
the
only
real
asset
the
business
had,
which
was
the
expirations,
that
is
the
policies.
an
independent
insurance
agent
has
one
asset.
that
is,
his
business,
his
good
will,
his
policies.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
they
are
assets.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
you're
considering
the
case,
they're
incidental
to
the
result
or
where
you
ought
to
be
focusing
on
erisa.
that
the
focus
should
be
on
the
ownership
of
assets
that
are
meaningful
with
respect
to
retirement.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
there
is
an
inconsistency
there,
your
honor,
because
rutherford
food
considered
some
typical
common
law
factors
as
well
as
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
it
looked
like
the
fourth
circuit
just
focused
on
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
i
do.
i
think
the
court
looked
more
at
the
economic
realities
in
reaching
its
result.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
yes.
in
the
way
these
people
were...
they
said,
well,
they
were
getting
paid,
you
know,
so
much,
how
much
for
each
piece
of
item
that
passed
on,
each
piece
of
meat,
or
whatever
they're
doing.
but
the
court
concluded
they
were
(a)
dependent
on
this
company
for
their
livelihood,
and
they
were
really
part
of
the
business.
now
in
this
case,
in
mr.
darden's
case,
about
who
owned
the
business.
he...
anybody
that
goes
into
business...
i
mean,
the
reason
you
go
into
business
for
yourself
is
to
build
up
some
equity,
something
you
can
use
when
you
get
old.
you
can
sell
it.
you
can
retire.
you
can
give
it
to
your
children.
you
don't
do
it
to
get
a
salary
now
because
it's
a
lot
of
work.
so
mr.
darden
built...
he
couldn't
build
up
his
own
equity,
his
own
business
because
nationwide
owned
it.
they
owned
the
whole
thing.
he
couldn't
sell
it.
so
were
he
to
retire...
he
couldn't
give
it
to
his
children
were
he
to
retire.
it's
not
like
people...
it's...
typical
independent
agent
can
sell
his
business
and
retire
on
it.
that's
why
when
you
focus
on
that
factor,
that's
the
main
one,
the
main
contentions
i
have,
is
the
court
should
focus
on
retirement
benefits
itself,
not
necessarily
the
furniture.
the
furniture,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
owns
the
furniture,
to
me.
i
don't
think
that
amounts
to
a
hill
of
beans.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
true.
it
focuses
on
people
who
have...
their
assets
are
not
oriented
toward...
necessarily
toward
their
retirement
because
they're
depending
in
a
way,
they
are
relying
and
depending
on
the
representations
that
the
employer
or
whoever
gave
them
the
retirement
made.
the
case
is
that...
here
is
that
nationwide
told
them
it
was
their
retirement.
they
gave
them
a
film
and
slide
show
that
are
in
the
evidence.
this
is
your
retirement.
you
can
depend
on
this.
he
said
okay,
and
he
stayed
there
20
years.
and
then
they
terminated
him
and
he
didn't
get
it.
but
the
relationship--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--that's
correct.
that's
what
it
provided.
and
that
was
what
it
was
that
we're
contending
that
those
provisions
are
not
enforceable
because
of
erisa,
because
of
congress'
policy
to
see...
to
give
people
a
nonforfeitable
right.
that's
why
they
enacted
the
statute.
i
mean,
if
you've
got
a
nonforfeited
right,
i
guess
you
can
steal
money
and
still
get
your
pension.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
rule.
and
that's
why
we
filed
the
claim.
another
factor
in...
that
relates
to
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
statute
and
what
the
fourth
circuit...
one
of
the
things
they
discussed
was
control.
and
it's
in
both...
both
in
the
common
law
definition
you
have
control
and
in
the
other
one,
in
the
darden
thing,
about
who
controls
the
details
of
the
business.
in
this
case,
the
court
found
that
nationwide
controlled
the
terms
of
the
agreement
itself,
that
is
that
they
were
able
to
dictate
to
their
agents
what
went
in
it.
they
were
given
the
agreement,
said
you
can
sign
it
or
leave.
now,
that
reflects
the
type
of
person
who's...
who
needs
or
would
be
covered
by
erisa.
it's
not...
and
also.
if
you
think
about
an
independent
contractor,
you
think
about
the
common
law
definition.
you
can
say,
well,
under
the
agreement
they
couldn't
do
this
and
they
couldn't
do
that.
but
if
you
can
dictate
the
terms
of
the
agreement
itself,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
total
control.
it's
irrelevant.
what...
they
let
him
do
it.
i
would
compare
the
relationship
between
nationwide
and
darden
to
more
of
a
parent-child
relationship
than
a
brother-sister
relationship.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
that's
not
in
erisa,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
origin
of
it,
but
i
agree
it
had
bearing
on
the
court's
decision.
but
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
word
employ--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--well,
i
don't
know.
i
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary
and
put
it
my
brief,
the
word
employ.
and
employ
means...
it's
a
fairly
broad
term.
it
means
to...
i
don't
recall,
but
one
of
the
examples
it
had
was
you
employ
a
lawyer
to
straighten
out
a
legal
tangle,
which
would
imply
that
the
word
employee
includes
independent
contractors.
it's
a
word
you
use
someone
to
do
something
for
you.
i
might
employ
someone
to
fix
my
house.
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
person's
my
employee.
it
only
means
i'm
using
him.
i
was
looking
at
the--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--i
would
think
it
would
be,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
statement
in
rutherford
that
the
definitions
of
the
law
employed
should
look
to
the
purposes
of
the
legislation
in
a
broad
remedial
statute.
to
me,
that
policy
out--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--well,
i'm
sure
they
are,
but
i
don't...
i
wouldn't
consider
the
internal
revenue
service
act
a
broad
remedial
statute.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
i
just...
the
ones
they
said
are
broad
remedial
statutes
dealt
with
problems
that
people
had
facing
some
kind
of
economic
difficulty.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
i
was
just
trying
to
compare
ones
that
the
courts
have
said
are
that
way.
i
don't
know.
there
was
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
social
security
act,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
this...
and
erisa
are
the
ones,
the
only
four
i'm
aware
of
that
where
people
have
used
that
tag.
there
may
be
many
others,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
them.
i
have
not
tried
to
go
find
them
all.
those
are
the
only
four
that
we've
really
talked
about
here.
this
one
is.
and
it
appears
to
me
it
would
be,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
to
look
to
rutherford,
u.s.
v.
silk,
and
these
other
cases
and
not
use
just
the
common
law
definition
of
employee.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
they
overruled
it
only
with
respect
to
those
particular
acts.
they
didn't
overrule
the
concept
that
was
put
forward.
they
said
we
don't
want
that
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
said...
they
didn't
say
anything
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
no,
absolutely.
you
wouldn't
look
at
it
in
interpreting
the
national
labor
relations
act,
true.
but
if
you
were
trying
to
use
that
concept
in
it
with
respect
to
the
broad
remedial
purpose
of
the
statutes
and
how
you
apply
it,
you
might
look
at
it.
courts
have.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
because
just...
in
that...
let
me
just
give
you
an
example.
in
the
case,
that
reid
case,
ccn
v.
reid,
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
where
they
said,
well,
you
know,
typically
you
look
at
the
common
law
to
look
at
common
terms.
you
would
look
at
the
common
law.
and
they
put...
compare
nlrb
v.
hearst
where
the
court
took
a
broader
view
based
on
the...
text...
context
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
this
court,
that
was
just
a
few
years
ago,
cited
nlrb
v.
hearst
publications,
the
proposition
that
in
a...
for
this
type
of
statute...
i'm
not
saying
this
particular
statute,
but
this
type
of
statute,
you
would
take
a
different
view.
you
would
not
just
do
it.
so
it's
still
alive
and
well.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
i
took
that
to
mean,
excuse
me,
that
it
was
alive
and
well.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
well,
i
don't
know
whether
you
consider
that
approving
citation,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
was
in
the
opinion.
i
read
it.
and
i
took
it
to
mean
that
hearst
was
not
overruled.
if
you
say
compare,
and
i...
compare
to
me
means
well
go
look
it
up.
it's
different.
so
that's
what
we
did.
i
think
that
it
does...
the
question
is
whether
it
makes
a
difference.
it
does
make
a
difference.
it
makes
a
difference
to
mr.
darden
and
it
makes
a
difference
to
other...
i'm
sure
other
people,
even
though
in
mr.
darden's
case,
as
far
as
the
difference
between
a...
the
common
law
definition,
i
guess
he
would
be
considered
in
sort
of
a
gray
area.
there
are
factors--
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
--they
said
he
probably
did
not.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
what
they
said.
now,
the
problem
with
the
status
of
the
case
now
on
that...
looking
from
that
aspect
is
that
we
never
tried
that
issue
out.
the
only
thing
we
ever
tried
out
was
whether
mr.
darden
passed
the
test
in
the
darden
opinion.
we
never
tried
out
the
question
of
whether
he
was
actually
the
common
law
employee
or
a
common
law
independent
contractor.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
that's
possible.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marion
g.
follin,
iii
correct.
because
we
never...
i
just...
it's
a
mistake
to
say...
to
jump
to
conclusion
that
he
is
an
independent
contractor
based
on
what's
before
you
now
because
the
trial
court
just
didn't
want
to
hear
about
that.
they
didn't
want
to
spend
the
time
figuring
out
all
these
different
things,
the
minutia
of
detail
about
control
that
was
exercised
over
him.
but
what
i
am
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
put
into
the
standard
the
important
relevant
considerations
arising
out
of
the
purposes
of
erisa
and
to
avoid
simply
adopting
a
common
law
standard
that
(a)
doesn't
have
any
relationship
to
the
purposes
of
that
statute,
and
(b)
has
been
proven,
at
least
to
my
satisfaction
that
did
not
work
in
cases
where
it's
been
tried.
and
i
cited
in
my
brief
professor
larson's
book
on
workers'
compensation.
he
was
very
critical
of
taking
this...
the
common
law
standard,
transposing...
just
putting
it
over
into
workers'
comp...
extremely
critical
of
it,
and
said
it'd
not
worked
and
terrible
problem.
and
they've
had
to
go
back.
now
they're
changing
it.
they're
changing
it
to
a
slightly
different
rule
because
workers'
comp
is
entirely
different
from
vicarious
liability.
if
you
adopt
the
standard
like
that,
and
just
stick
it
in
here,
i
think
if
you...
if
the
results
are
the
same
as
what
is
done
is
workers'
comp,
you'll
end
up
coming
back...
somebody
will
come
back
in
30
or
40
years
and
have
to
face
a
quagmire.
i
don't
know.
if
you
got...
there
was
a
case
i
read
that
you
cited
last
year
about
seamen
and
longshoremen.
it
seemed
like
in
1940
or
so,
the
court
issued
an
opinion,
and
this
created
a
lot
of
confusion
and
then
you
had
come
back
50
years
later
and
kind
of
tidy
it
up.
it
seems
to
me
you're
better
off
in
my
view
looking
straight
at
the
statute
and
mr.
darden's
particular
facts,
the
particular
things
about
mr.
darden,
and
writing
about
that
and
citing
on
that
basis.
the
narrow,
the
very
narrow
basis,
as
narrow
as
possible,
you
leave
open
other
considerations
out
of
the
circuit
courts
or
other
courts
to
follow,
other
people
to
follow,
to
interpret
the
erisa
and
not
close
it
off
by
saying
you
just
can
use
these
10
or
11
factors
out
of
the
restatement
of
agency.
and
then
you
go
home
and
you've
listed
them.
it's
like,
you
know,
it
doesn't
have
any
relationship
to
what
the
purposes
of
the
statute
are,
and
i
think
that
if
you
relate
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
the
common
law
factors,
you
can
tie
them
together.
and
it's
perfectly
legitimate.
i
understand
the
rutherford
case.
i
understand
you
want
to
be
aware
of
precedent.
i
understand
that
the
court
wants
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
common
law
when
they
see
statutory
terms.
but
i
also
ask
you
and
urge
you
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
this
statute
that...
the
statute
takes
life
out
of
its...
and
breath
out
of
what
its
purposes
are.
congress
can't
anticipate
every
act,
every
single
person
that
comes
along.
mr.
darden's
case
is
different.
there
may
be...
never
be
another
mr.
darden
or
anyone
like
him.
all
i'm
asking
you
to
do
is
look
at
mr.
darden's
case
with
great
attention
to
his
particular
set
of
facts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i
will
conclude
my
remarks.
thank
you
very
much.
