justice
david
h.
souter
the
third
and
blessedly
shortest
case
is
nationwide
mutual
insurance
company
and
darden,
no.
90-1802.
in
this
case,
we
issued
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
to
determine
the
test
of
status
as
an
employee
under
the
employment
retirement
income
security
act
or
erisa.
robert
darden
operated
an
insurance
agency
according
to
the
terms
of
several
contracts
with
petitioner,
nationwide
mutual
insurance
company.
under
the
contracts,
darden
agreed
to
forfeit
his
right
to
retirement
plan
benefits
if
within
a
year
of
his
termination
as
a
nationwide
agent
in
25
miles
of
his
prior
business
location,
he
sold
insurance
in
competition
with
nationwide.
when
nationwide
relied
on
that
condition,
to
deny
him
retirement
benefits
to
which
would
otherwise
have
been
entitled.
darden
sued
for
them
claiming
that
they
were
non-forfeitable
because
already
vested
under
the
terms
of
erisa.
darden
has
an
action
under
erisa
only
if
he
qualifies
as
an
employee
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
statute.
the
district
court
held
that
under
traditional
common
law
principles,
darden
had
worked
for
nationwide
as
an
independent
contractor
and
not
as
an
employee.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
finding
the
common
law
test
inapplicable
in
this
context
and
holding
instead
that
an
erisa
plaintiff
can
qualify
as
an
employee
simply
by
showing
that
he
had
reasonable
expectation
of
receiving
pension
benefits,
that
he
relied
on
the
expectation,
and
that
he
lacked
the
economic
bargaining
power
to
contract
out
of
benefit
plan
forfeiture
provisions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
unanimously
reverse.
under
erisa,
an
employee
is
any
individual
employed
by
an
employer,
a
completely
circular
definition
that
explains
nothing.
in
the
past,
when
congress
has
used
the
term
employee
without
defining
it
in
any
helpful
way,
we
have
construed
the
term
to
incorporate
common
law
or
agency
principles
for
identifying
master-servant
relationships,
and
we
adapt
that
rule
here
as
well
since
nothing
in
erisa
suggest
that
construing
the
statute
to
incorporate
the
common
law
criteria
would
tort
the
congressional
design
will
lead
to
absurd
results.
we
remand
the
case
to
the
fourth
circuit
to
determine
whether
darden
does
in
fact
qualify
as
an
employee
under
traditional
common
law
principles.
