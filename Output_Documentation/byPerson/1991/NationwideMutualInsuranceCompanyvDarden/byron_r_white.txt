does
the
definition
section
of
erisa
include
the
provision
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
says
an
employee
includes
any
individual
employed
by
an
employer?
but
it
also
goes
on
to
say
employ
includes
to
suffer
or
permit
to
work.
justice

it
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the...
that
seems
to
have
been
very
important
under
rutherford,
because
that
definition
was
taken
from
the
child
labor
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
certainly
doesn't
sound
like
a...
the
common
law
definition,
does
it?
justice
byron

white
if
we
happen
to
disagree
with
you,
it
would
go
back
i
suppose,
for
further
proceedings.
justice

to
see
whether
under
the
right
standard
darden's
an
employee.
justice
byron
r.

how
about
the...
how
about
your
reply
brief?
the
united
states
filed
with
this
case
before
you
filed
your
reply
brief,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
certainly
used
rutherford
food.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
might
have
said,
why
you
were
quite
right,
mr.
court,
in
construing
the
old
act,
but
we
just
don't
like
it
anymore.
so
we're
going
to
amend
it.
