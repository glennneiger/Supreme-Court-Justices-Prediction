mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
first
turn
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
would
like
to
add
a
few
more
comments.
employee
is
a
very
basic
term
in
erisa
and
it's
used
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
and
i
can
think
of
three
where
an
employer
would
very
much
need
to
know
from
the
start
whether
he's
dealing
with
employees
or
independent
contractors.
first,
the
basic
tax
qualification
rule
provides
that
a
plan
may
only
obtain
the
tax
benefits
available
under
erisa
if
it
exists
for
the
exclusive
benefits
of
employees.
second,
erisa's
nondiscrimination
rules
allow
tax
benefits
for
plans
only
if
the
plans
do
not
discriminate
against
low-compensation
employees.
again,
you
need
to
know
what...
who
is
an
employee,
and
who
is
an
independent
contractor
in
figuring
out
whether
there's
discrimination.
third,
whether
or
not
a
plan
qualifies
for
tax
benefits
which
are
available
under
title
ii
of
erisa,
if
the
plan
affects
employees,
then
the
employer
must
comply
with
the
reporting
and
disclosure
provisions
in
title
i
of
erisa.
so
it's
critical
from
the
start
for
an
employer
to
know
whether
he's
dealing
with
people
covered
by
the
statute
or
not.
and
that
is
why
both
labor
and
the
irs
provide
for
employers
to
get
opinion...
opinion
letters
from
them,
revenue
rulings,
as
they
are
called
in
the
case
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
and
i
think
it's
obvious,
for
the
reasons
mr.
ragsdale
stated,
that
the
fourth
circuit's
test,
which
turns
on
the
subjective
reliance
factors
of
individuals,
is
simply
not
a
practical
test
to
use
here.
on
the
remand
after
the
fourth
circuit's
first
decision,
the
district
court
determined
that
darden
is
an
employee
largely
because,
although
he
had
opened
an
individual
retirement
account
and
had
taken
out
an
annuity,
he
had
only
put
about
$18,000
in
those
accounts.
if
he
had
put
more
money
in
the
account,
the
district
court
would
have
found
that
he
wasn't
relying
on
nationwide's
plan,
and
would
have
found
him
to
be
an
independent
contractor.
we
don't
think
that
the
qualification
of
plans
can
turn
on
such
subjective
criteria.
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
do,
as
justice
o'connor
put
it,
think
that
it
has
to
be
applied
in
terms
of
the
remedial
purposes
of
erisa,
and
let
me
try
to
tell
you
what
i
mean
by
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
first,
let
me
say
that
we...
this
isn't
our
test.
this
is
this
court's
test
set
forth
in
rutherford
food,
which
i
think
is
the
most
relevant
case
for
this
court
to
consider.
rutherford
food
was
the
1946
case
involving
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
definition
of
employee
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
identical
to
the
definition
of
employee
in
section
36
of
erisa.
that
is,
it
says
an
employee
is
any
individual
employed
by
an
employer.
now
this
court
looked
primarily
to
the
common
law
factors
in
determining
whether
the
butchers
involved
in
that
case
were
employees
or
independent
contractors.
but
it
also
said
that
congress'
choice
of
such
broad
language,
any
individual
employed
by
an
employer,
indicated
that
in
some
cases
the
test
might
depart
from
the
common
law.
this
court
said
that,
page
728
of
the
opinion.
it
also
added
that
it
was
most
appropriate
to
look
at
industry
practice
to
see
whether
a
label
was
being
attached
simply
to
circumvent
the
purposes
of
the
act.
in
the
rutherford
food
case,
for
instance,
these
boners
were
clearly
a
part
of
the
whole
process
of
turning
cattle
into
retail
products.
and
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it
is.
but
let
me
say
that
congress
has
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no.
and
congress'
adoption
of
the
exact
language
used
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
1974,
in
light
of
that
language
in
the
flsa
and
this
court's
decision
seems
to
us
to
be
a
powerful
evidence
that
congress
intends
erisa
to
be
similarly
interpreted.
now--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
let
me
turn
to
that.
as
you
said
earlier,
there's
some
venerable
confusion
involving
the
common
law
test.
the
common
law
test
has
led
to
clear
answers
in
some...
in
many
cases.
and
indeed,
we
think
it's
led
to
a
very
clear
answer
with
respect
to
insurance
agents
like
darden.
they
are
independent
contractors.
but
debit
agents,
for
instance,
the
sort
of
collection
agent
involved
in
the
united
insurance
case,
the
courts,
the
state
courts
are
all
over
the
lot
in
the
auto
accident
cases
as
to
whether
debit
agents
are
independent
contractors
or
whether
they're
employees.
we
think
in
a
situation
where
the
common
law
test
does
not
clearly
lead
to
one
result
or
another,
it
would
be
proper
to
consider
the
remedial
purposes
of
erisa
and
conclude,
just
as
this
court
concluded
in
applying
the
common
law
test,
that
debit
agents
might
properly
be
considered
the
employees.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
that
there
are
certain
close
cases
where
it's
not
so
much
an
expansion
as
a
rule
of
how
to
determine
whether
someone
like
debit
agents
are
on
one
side
or
another.
let
me
turn
to
a
second
difference.
under
the
common
law--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
unfortunately,
it's
not
always
that
easy.
sometimes
the
remedial
purposes
of
erisa
would
point,
as
in
the
professional
and
executive
leasing
case,
to
a
finding
that
the
people
in
question
were
not
employees.
that
is
the
case
that
involves
the
second
difference.
one
of
the
common
law
factors
is
the
label
attached
to
the
employees.
and
there
is...
there
have
been
many
cases
involving
what
seemed
to
be
clear
attempts
to
circumvent
erisa.
for
instance,
in
that
case,
that
was
the
case
where
the
professionals,
in
order
to
avoid
the
nondiscrimination
rules
and
not
cover
their
nurses
and
secretaries,
made
an
agreement
that
they
would
be
employees
of
a
leasing
company
which
purported
to
lease
them
back
to
their
professional
corporations
to
provide
services.
in
that
case,
looking
at
the
whole
transaction,
the
irs,
and
then
later
the
tax
court,
agreed
that
the
professionals
were
not
employees
of
this
leasing
company,
but
were
in
fact
employees
of
the
professional
corporation.
so
that
if
the
professionals
wanted
to
set
up
a
tax-qualified
pension
plan,
they
would
have
to
cover
some
of
their
employees
as
well.
there's
a
third
difference
between
the
way
the
irs
and
labor
approach
these
cases
and
the
way
it
often
works
in
the
common
law
test.
and
the
common
law
test
is
often
applied
as
in
the
auto
accident
cases
in
an
intensely
fact-specific
way.
with
the
debit
agents,
for
instance,
there
have
been
cases
from
the
same
state
where
a
debit
agent
who's
on
his
way
to
make
a
collection,
their
primary
job
is
found
to
be
an
employee.
but
if
a
debit
agent
happens
to
be
on
the
way
to
sell
insurance
to
someone,
he
is
found
to
be
an
independent
contractor.
now
for
the
reasons
i
started
out
with
in
speaking
to
justice
kennedy,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
a
more
categorical
approach
has
to
be
taken
under
erisa,
and
persons...
there
has
to
be
a
treatment
of
insurance
agents
employed...
for
instance
in
this
case,
all
insurance
agents
covered
by
the
same
agency
agreement
with
nationwide
have
to
be
placed
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
they're
all
covered
by
the
same
agency
agreement.
everyone
covered
by
the
same
agreement
should
be
treated
the
same.
thank
you.
