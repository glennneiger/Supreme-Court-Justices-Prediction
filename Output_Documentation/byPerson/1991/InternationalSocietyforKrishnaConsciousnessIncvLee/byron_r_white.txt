justice

you
would
say
that
if
an
airport
permanently
permitted
only
ticketed
passengers
that
you
would
think
that
was
invalid.
justice
white
well,
it's
hardly
a
time,
place,
or
manner--
justice
white
--regulation,
is
it?
justice
white
just
as
long
as
it's
forever,
that's
a
time
all
right.
justice
white
yeah,
but
not
forever.
not
forever.
let's
just
talk
about
kennedy
airport.
now,
do
you
agree
that
the
port
authority
could
ban
all
people
from
the
airport
except
ticketed
passengers
inside
the
terminal,
or
not?
i
thought
you
said
yes
a
while
ago.
justice
white
it
can't
be
a
public
forum
if
they
could
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
white
--you
were
arguing.
justice
white
thank
you.
justice
white
what
do
your
lessees
do
in
the
forum
with
respect
to
handing
out
literature
and
soliciting?
say
there's
a
place
where...
a
fast
food
place
where
you
can
sit
down
and
do
sit
down.
do
your
lessees
allow
solicitation?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
don't
you
lease
out
areas
to
stores?
justice
white
well,
but
it
would
be
up
to
the
lessee,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
you
don't
require
the
lessees
to
keep
them
out
or
let
them
in.
justice
white
so
it
would
depend
on
the
lessee
as
to
whether
solicitation
could
take
place
in,
say,
a
bar.
justice
white
but
how
about
stores?
justice
white
i
take
it
your...
i
take
it
that
your
regulation
would
forbid
solicitation
or
handing
out
of
handbills
at
the
very
entrance,
say,
to
a
big
store.
justice
white
even
though
anybody
who
is
entering
that
store
certainly
isn't
on
the
way
to
a
gate.
justice
white
what
difference
does
that
make,
by
the
way?
justice
white
it
just
means
that
they
are
what,
going
to
be
bothered
against
their
will?
