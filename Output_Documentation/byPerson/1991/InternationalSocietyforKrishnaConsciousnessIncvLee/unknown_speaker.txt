maybe
you're
not
making...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
have
to
show
was
accepted
is
not
just
that
people
they
like
were
allowed
there,
you
have
to
show
that
people
they
didn't
like
were
allowed
there,
that
people
they
didn't
want
were
allowed
there.
all
that
your
brief
shows,
i
think,
is
that
the
people
that
own
these
facilities
or
the
municipalities
that
own
these
facilities
liked
to
have
certain
people
there,
but
you
never
show
that
somebody
that
they
didn't
like
could
not
have
been
excluded.
