justice
o'connor
--mr.
fisher--
justice
o'connor
--would
you
conceive
that
the
airport
could
limit
access
to
only
ticketed
passengers?
justice
o'connor
and
it
did
so
rather
recently
in
many
areas--
justice
o'connor
--did
it
not?
yes.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
that
conceded
ability
of
the
airport
to
limit
access
bears
on
our
forum
analysis
in
any
way?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
it
had
some
relationship
to
the
analysis
in
kokinda,
for
example,
and
i
just
wondered
how
you
would
characterize
that.
justice
o'connor
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
o'connor
and
you're
reading
from
the
district
court--
justice
o'connor
does
the
regulation
allow
the
gathering
of
signatures
on
petitions
in
the
airport?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
the
regulation
only
went
to
repetitive
distribution
of
literature.
am
i
wrong?
justice
o'connor
well,
by
repetitive,
does
that
mean
to
more
than
one
person,
or
does
that
mean
on
more
than
one
occasion,
or
what?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
that...
as
you
understand
it,
would
it
prohibit
a
local
charity,
for
example,
from
going
to
the
airport
on
a
given
day
and
handing
out
a
bunch
of
leaflets
encouraging
people
to
participate
in
a
fundraising
activity
to
many
people,
or
does
it
just
prohibit
coming
back
day
after
day
to
do
that?
i
don't
understand.
justice
o'connor
to
more
than
one
person.
justice
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
it's
a
nonpublic
forum,
do
the
regulations
still
have
to
meet
a
reasonable
test,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
and
in
an
airport
that
has
a
lot
of
commercial
activity
and
permits
people
to
stand
around
and
visit
and
allows
children
to
play,
and
petition
signatures
to
be
gathered
and
one
thing
and
another,
do
you
think
it's
reasonable
to
prohibit
the
passing
out
of
literature
in
the
public
area?
you
defend
that
as
being
totally
reasonable.
justice
o'connor
and
why?
justice
o'connor
well
now,
how
can
you
say
that
handing
out
a
leaflet
to
someone
who
wants
to
accept
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
other
activities
that
the
airport
has
allowed,
and
hasn't
this
court
drawn
a
distinction
in
part
for
solicitation,
which
requires
much
more?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
it
bother
you
if
you
say
no
thanks,
and
keep
walking?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
next
two
cases
are
related.
they
are
a
petition
and
a
cross-petition.
one
of
them,
i
am
announcing
on
behalf
of
the
chief
justice
who
was
unable
to
here
this
morning
for
the
announcement.
these
cases
come
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondent
in
international
society
for
krishna
consciousness
against
lee,
and
lee
against
the
international
society
for
krishna
consciousness.
the
respondent
operates
three
major
airports
in
the
new
york
city
area.
it
adapted
a
regulation
banning
the
repetitive
solicitation
of
money
within
its
terminals
while
allowing
such
solicitation
on
the
sidewalks
outside
the
terminal.
the
petitioner
is
a
not-for-profit
religious
corporation
whose
members
solicit
funds
in
public
places
to
support
their
movement.
it
brought
suit
claiming
that
the
regulation
banning
solicitation
activities
deprive
them
of
their
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
the
chief
justice,
we
hold
that
the
airport
terminals
are
not
public
fora.
historically,
airports
have
not
been
made
available
as
locations
for
speech
activity,
nor
has
the
respondent
in
this
case
voluntarily
opened
the
terminals
to
solicitation.
to
survive
review,
therefore,
the
solicitation
ban
need
only
be
shown
to
be
reasonable.
the
solicitation
ban
satisfies
this
test
as
it
is
a
reasonable
means
of
attacking
the
risks
of
duress,
fraud,
and
congestion
that
attend
personal
solicitation
for
funds
in
airports.
in
a
separate
per
curium
opinion,
dealing
with
the
related
challenge
to
respondent's
ban
on
leafleting
activity
within
the
terminals,
we
strike
down
the
port
authority's
regulation.
i
have
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
he
is
joined
in
part
by
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
and
souter;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
joined;
chief
justice
rehnquist
has
delivered
a
second
opinion
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
white,
scalia,
and
thomas
joined.
now,
if
anyone
can
figure
that
out,
they
are
doing
well.
