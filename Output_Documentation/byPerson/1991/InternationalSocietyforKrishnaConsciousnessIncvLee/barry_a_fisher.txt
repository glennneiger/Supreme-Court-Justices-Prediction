mr.
barry
a.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
born
at
the
onset
of
the
seventies
and
by
the
early
eighties
the
subject
of
an
unusual
consensus
of
30-plus
cases,
now
in
the
nineties
the
issue
presented
today
of
airport
crossroads
as
commerce
and
idea
marketplaces
may
well
serve
to
shape
the
future
of
the
public
forum
as
we
not
long
from
now
end
this
and
enter
the
next
century.
and
it's
from
the
vantage
point
today
of
what
so
many
cases,
including
six
circuits,
the
canadian
supreme
court,
findings
of
congress
and
the
faa
with
its
special
knowledge
and
airport
expertise,
almost
20
years
of
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
that
have
been
tailored
by
airports
throughout
the
country
to
ensure
and
protect
the
free
and
unburdened
passenger
flow
at
airports,
also
today
some
free
market
and
other
analysis
supplied
by
amici,
free
congress
foundation
and
concerned
women
for
america,
and
also
unlike
perhaps
any
case
in
recent
times,
a
kind
of
special
judicial
notice
because
everyone
in
the
courtroom
has
probably
witnessed
what's
at
issue
here.
indeed,
your
honors,
from
the
ninth
circuit's
kuszynski...
the
'73
case,
not
the
judge...
to
the
present,
no
kind
of
forum
has
been
the
subject
of
so
much
analysis
covering
so
many
facets,
and
it's
from
this
vantage
point
that
we
present
this
case
today
which
began
17
years
ago
with
a
very
fast
track
start
of
a
tro
hearing
within
less
than
an
hour
of
filing
the
case
that
i
had
with
my
colleague
here,
mr.
berg.
but
soon
the
case
took
a
slow
track
nose
dive,
and
the
first
13
years
of
the
case...
'75
to
'88...
focus
solely
on
the
airline
leased
terminals
as
opposed
to
the
port
authority
unleased
general
circulation
areas,
which
the
port
authority
months
before
we
filed
the
case,
months
before
we
talked
about
the
case,
said
was
subject
to
no
regulations
excluding
iskcon,
and
the
port
authority
agreed
to
iskcon's
very
limited
presence
and
subject
to
detailed
port
authority
tailored
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations,
and
these
regulations
were
altered
over
the
ensuing
13
years
as
the
port
authority
saw
its
needs
increase,
and
i
want
to
give
an
example.
the
only
place
at
kennedy
airport
that
was
allowed
then
and
is
allowed
to
this
day
is
an
off-the-beaten-track
area
in
the
mezzanine
area
of
the
international
arrivals
building.
it's
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stained
glass
chapel
that
holds
regular
catholic,
protestant,
and
jewish
services.
now,
during
the
first
13
years
of
the
case
the
port
authority
neither
disputed
that
those
areas
that
they
allowed
iskcon
to
be
in
were
public
fora
nor
did
they
complain
about
the
agreement,
and
the
airport
deputy
director,
mr.
sloane,
testified
in
his
deposition
in
1985
that
the
arrangement
with
iskcon
worked
out
okay.
but
your
honors,
in
1988,
iskcon
settled
with
all
the
airlines.
at
one
point
the
district
court
ordered
in
every
airline
from
aeroflot
to
zambia
air,
but
we
settled
with
all
of
the
airlines
and
the
port
authority
standing
alone
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
case
and
perhaps
inspired
by
jews
for
jesus
that
not
long
ago
at
that
point
expressly
left
the
public
forum
issue
open,
in
1988
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
the
port
authority
put
the
nonleased
areas
at
issue
when
it
declared
at
a
summary
judgment
proceeding--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
think
what
this
case
is
about,
and
what
the--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--the
answer
is
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--i'm
not
arguing
that
point,
and
the
reason
i'm
presenting
this
is
that
i
think
that
it's
important
for
the
actual
factual
context
of
this
case
and
the
importance
or
nonimportance
of
facts
that
are
now
being
argued
to
the
court
be
put
in
perspective
as
to
what
this
case
is
about,
so
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
understand
this,
and
i'll
just
spend
another
minute
or
two
on
it.
but
at
the
summary
judgment
hearing
it
was
announced
for
the
first
time
that
a
regulation
had
just
been
promulgated
banning
iskcon's
literature
distribution
and
solicitations,
but
your
honors,
at
that
summary
judgment
hearing
which
was
held
4
years
ago
today
on
march
25,
1988,
mr.
berg
at
joint
appendix
496
underscored
that
the
ban
was
based
on
purpose
characterization,
a
legal
presentation,
and
not
anything
to
do
with
iskcon's
conduct,
and
that
if
the
court
did
in
fact
determine
that
the
areas
in
question
were
public
fora,
then
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
the
court
authority
was
concerned,
and
he
said,
we
don't
object
to
the
present
arrangement
that's
been
made.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
the
briefs
here
say
that
if
it
is
a
forum
it
can
still
be
excluded.
now,
the
port
authority
enacted
this
regulation,
announced
that
day,
behind
closed
doors
without
any
record,
without
any
hearing,
except
a
preamble,
and
that
makes
clear
that
it
was
directed
at
iskcon's
scripture
ministry
which
consists
of
religious
book
distribution
and
solicitations
from
book-takers
of
a
printing
cost-defraying
donation
without
which
their
ministry
would
be
crippled.
now,
the
regulations
preamble
singles
out
iskcon
in
a
way
that
is
not
so
different
from
the
way
that
the
moonies
were
singled
out
in
the
law
that
was
struck
down
in
larson
v.
valente
and
the
laws
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
1880's
that
were
tailored
to
exclude
the
salvation
army
from
their
particular
mode
of
expression.
now,
as
i've
said,
the
petitioners
have
continued
their
activity
at
the
airports
during
the
last
4
years,
as
they
have
for
the
13-plus
years
before,
pending
review
of
this
law
that
categorically
bans
their
literature
distribution
and
solicitations
in
the
terminals
if
done
for
any
length
of
time,
no
matter
how
innocuously
conducted,
but
the
regulation
does
recognize
that
the
terminals
are
fora
for
and
does
permit
continuous
preaching,
but
not
1
timothy
5,
and
it
allows
repetitive
singing,
but
not
the
praises
of
solicitations.
it
does--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
the--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--in
desert
storm.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
and
that
wasn't
the
first
time
that
that
happened.
over
the
17
years
of
this
case
there
have
been
storms,
there
have
been
wars,
there
have
been
a
number
of
instances
where
all
or
part
of
the
airports
have
been
restricted
to
ticketed
passengers.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
not
on
the
question
of
whether
the
airport
is
a
forum
or
not.
it
bears
on
the
question
of
what
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
would
be
appropriate,
and
in
fact
i
mentioned
airports
throughout
the
country
that
have
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations,
they
typically
provide
for
emergency
situations
and
what-have-you
where
it's
necessary
to--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--i
don't
think
that
the
question,
again,
of
whether
the
airport
is
a
forum
which
can
be
subject
to
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
as
it
has
been
for
these
17
years
is
answered
by
the
question
of
whether,
in
an
emergency
or
some
catastrophe
or
whatever,
areas
in
addition
to
areas
that
normally
would
be
no
problem
for
passenger
flow
or
whatever,
whether
those
areas
also
could
be
closed
at
that
time.
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
in
and
of
itself,
the
fact
that
at
some
points
it
could
be
closed.
i
mean,
obviously
the
sidewalks
and
the
parks
can
be
closed
at
certain
times,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
they
are
classic
public
fora.
i
was
commenting
on
this
regulation
of
what
it
allows
and
doesn't
allow.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
not
necessarily.
i
think--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
it
wouldn't
be--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--no.
your
honor,
it's
true--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--that's
a
time--
[laughter]
and
what
the
petitioners
do
is
a
manner,
i
suppose,
but
the...
you
know,
we
might
come
back
to
a
court
such
as
this,
if
that
were
the
case,
and
argue
that
it
didn't
make
any
sense
whatsoever
and
challenge
it
under
the
court's
jurisprudence
regarding
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations,
and
say
that
that
isn't
the
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
i
would
hope
it
at
least
includes
that.
pardon?
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
whether
it's
a
public
forum--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
i
don't
know
what
it
would
look
like
if
they
really
did
that.
it
would
not
make
it
a--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--i
acknowledge
that
you
can
have
an
airport
that
did
that.
it
wouldn't
have
the
attraction
of
shops,
and
therefore
there
wouldn't
be
shops,
and
there
wouldn't
be
a
lot
of
the
things
that
are
at
the
airports--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--in
some
places
and
some
times,
you
can
close
streets.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
said
yes
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
happens
on
occasion.
now,
whether
they
could
do
it
all
the
time
would--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well...
all
i
meant
by
that
was
that
it
would
be
subject
to
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation,
and
i
would
argue
that
they
couldn't,
but
in
fact
they
do
sometimes
close
the
airports.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
thank
you.
[laughter]
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
that
obviously
is
true,
that
this
has
never
happened.
it's
happened
for
short
periods
of
time.
we
are
talking
theoretically,
and
i
guess
i
could
envision
some
airport
that
wanted
to
do
that,
and
let
me
just
say
that
over
the
years
of
this
litigation
where
airports
decided
to
close
off...
i
mean,
it
wasn't
always
that
ticketed
passengers
at
some
airports
couldn't
go
beyond
a
security
check,
but
now
in
some
places
they
do
that,
and
generally
iskcon
has
respected
that
and
not
challenged
that
proposition.
if
it
wasn't
open
to
the
general
public
beyond
the
security
check
area,
then
they
sought
the
general
circulation
areas
where
the
general
public
was
allowed.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
wide
variety
of
people
that
come
to
the
airport.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
cannot
refer
you
to
the
page.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
the
findings
were
generally
characterizing
the
airport,
pointing
out
that
people
come
to
the
airport,
first
of
all
travelers,
and
they're
there
and
they're
waiting
around
because
of
delay,
cancelled
flights--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes.
meeters...
there
are
meeters
and
greeters,
they
have
art
and
music
exhibits
and
events
at
airports
that
are
designed
to
attract
people.
there
are
people
that
do
go
to
the
airport
shops
to
shop.
there
are
very
profitable--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
and
the
answer
is
yes.
there
are
people
that
are
curious,
people
that
hang
out
at
airports,
that
go
to
anton's
at
national
airport--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--i'm
sorry,
i
cannot
refer
you...
i
cannot
refer
you
to
a
specific--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--there
are
materials
in
our
brief
that
set
out
statistics
regarding
the
nature
and
interest
of
the
people
that
go
to
the
airports,
and
it's
a
wide
variety,
and
it's
all
set
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
and
airports
generally
in
the
country.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
the
airports
are
designed
to
attract
large
numbers
of
people
and
to
fill
their
time
while
they
are
waiting,
and
people
wait
whether
they're
meeters
or
greeters
or
people
on
journeys.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
they're
trying
to
get
people
to
come
there.
isn't
that
surprising?
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
your
honor,
there
are--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--there
are
wonderful
shops
there.
for
17
years
there's
been
the
opportunity
for
spiritual
counseling,
there's
a...
there's
such
a
wide
variety
of
opportunities
for
spending
time
out
there.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
factor.
this
gets
into
perhaps
a
designated
forum.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
the
theory
of
the
case
first
of
all
is
that
the
airport
is
a
transportation
crossroads
and
we've
made
an
argument
of
crossroads
and
transportation
nodes
in
history
that
are
marketplaces
for
commerce
and
ideas
and
that
are
appropriate
places
for
first
amendment
expression.
that's
the
first
argument.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
there
would
be
the
argument
discussed
before
that
even
if
arbitrarily
and
suddenly
they
decided
to
close
the
airport
to
the
nonticketed
public
that
it
would
still
be
a
public
forum.
the
fact
here
is
that
these
airports
and
airports
generally
serve
a
billion
people
a
year
half
of
which
are
nontravelers
and
they
are
set
aside
and
designated
and
utilized
by
a
wide
variety
of
public
and
the
public
is
encouraged
by
a
wide
variety
of
shops
and
what-have-you
to
spend
time
there,
to
spend
money,
and
to
utilize
the
airports
in
ways
that
public
malls
are--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--the
cases
that
we
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
the
airports
as
a
general
proposition
throughout
the
country,
like
streets
and
parks,
are
thoroughfares
and
sidewalks
and
the
same
sort
of
enterprise
of
government
that
provides
a
place
for
commerce
and
ideas
to
be
disseminated
is
the
public
street
cases
and
all
of
the
park
cases
and
it's
a
jurisprudence
that
is
not
so
well
developed.
there
are
not
so
many
cases
that
define
the
public
forum.
you
have
a
first
case
of
hague
v.
cio
that
makes
some
comment
about
from
time
immemorial.
you
have
cases
that
we
cited
that
go
back
to
the
last
century.
the
salvation
army
cases,
which
were
state
supreme
court
cases
that
talk
in
terms
of
natural
law
and
common
law,
and
it's
this
tradition,
it's
the
accepted
social
norms
that
we
pointed
to
in
our
briefs
that
show
that
the
fanning
out
of
religious
true
believers
and
others
throughout
the
country
to
transportation
centers
through
history--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--sometimes
that's
the
case.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
well,
the
salvation
army
cases
that
we
came
across
from
the
1880's,
soon
after
the
salvation
army
came
through
ellis
island
to
these
shores,
were
cases
where
the
cities
tried
to
exclude
them
and
they
weren't
based
on
first
amendment
law
but
the
courts
talked
in
terms
of
natural
law
or
common
law,
and
it's
true,
you
know,
we
have
a
history
that
we've
shown
in
our
brief
of
the
fact
of
this
activity
taking
place,
of
the
fact
of
broadsides
and
pamphlets
being
distributed
everywhere
where
there
were
people
in
the
18th
century,
and
the
american
track
society
and
others
sending
out
their
culpators
to
pioneer
wagon
train
trailheads
and
to
docks
and
to
riverboat
sidings
and
everywhere
else.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i'm
not
arguing
that
it
does
make
it
a
forum,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
word
tradition
comes
into
play
and
history
is
any
part
of
the
decision,
looking
to
what
was
accepted,
what
really
occurred
over
our
history,
is
something
that
the
court
should
consider,
and
so
looking
to
what
has
been
the
history,
what
has
been
accepted,
what
were
the
social
norms,
is
what
we've
presented
in
part
in
our
argument.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
your
honor--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
many
of
these
religious
groups
in
the
18th
century
and
19th
century
that
we
point
to
are
the
predecessors
of
the
hare
krishnas.
they
were
unpopular
groups
that
fanned
out,
that
were
going
everywhere
they
could
to
public
places,
and
this
case
does
not
turn
on
hotels
and
private
places.
we
don't
make
that
argument
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
that's
a
factor--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--no,
i
think
that's
a
factor--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--no,
your
honor,
you
misperceived
what
i
say.
as
we
said
in
our
briefs,
we
argue
the
characteristics
of
the
facility
and
its
similarity
to
streets
and
parks,
we
argue
the
history
of
acceptance
regarding
public
transportation
centers
throughout
american
history
and
even
english
common
law
history,
and
we
point
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
new
york
port
authority
and
the
history
of
the
people
that
are
there,
and
the
designation
and
allowance
of
this
activity
for
all
these
years.
it's
a
recent
convention,
it's
a
tradition,
it's
all
of
these
things
that
come
together
that
make
this
a
public
forum,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
narrow
pavement
strip
serving
the
post
office
parking
lot
in
kokinda,
of
course,
is
wholly
unlike
the
complex
environment
and
the
actual
use
and
the
reality
of
the
new
york
area
airports
that
the
district
court
found
in
its
opinion
to
add
up
to
it
being
a
public
forum.
the
port
authority,
as
is
clear,
allows
continuous
solicitations
of
people
to
read
and
sign
petitions
and
membership
forums,
but
you
can't
give
out
a
self-addressed
donation
mailer,
you
can't
stand
there
mute
holding
a
bucket,
and
you
can
say
read
this
and
sign
this,
but
not
give
or
join,
distinctions
that
are
not
borne
out
as
having
any
impact
difference
in
the
record
of
this
case.
and
in
fact
this
case
was
not
ever...
was
not
ever
presented
by
the
port
authority
as
one
dealing
with
specific
impacts
justifying
the
regulation
or
even
before
1988
when
there
wasn't
a
regulation,
they
never
argued
the
facts,
and
in
fact
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
this.
it's
a
single
page,
bald
table
with
numbers,
and
it
tells
you
failure
to
check
in,
to
wear
id's,
and
some
other
problems
that
they've
had
in
administering
this,
which
are
minor
and
diminished
by
1980
and
trail
off
by
1984,
and
the
chart
ends
in
1986.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
i
suppose
so,
your
honor,
and
what
it
did
that
none
of
the
litigants
asked
to
be
done.
what
the
court...
what
the
second
circuit
did,
even
though
nobody
had
argued
this
and
there
wasn't
any
evidence
to
support
it,
was
to
say
yes
on
a
literature
distribution
and
no
on
solicitations,
but
there's
not
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case
to
support
any
such
distinction.
as
i
say,
nor
was
it
asked
for.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
exactly.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
also,
the...
you
know,
there
was
a
question
a
moment
ago
about
sidewalks.
sidewalks
were
never
mentioned
in
this
case
until
the
brief
before
this
court.
it
wasn't
argued
in
the
district
court,
it
wasn't
argued
or
mentioned
or
briefed,
or
there's
no
evidence
on--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--it's
not
even
mentioned
in
the
regulations,
your
honor.
the
regulation
that
is
the
subject
of
this
case
only
refers
to
the
interiors,
which
have
been
the
forum
that
has
been
the
focus
of
this
case
and
the
attention
of
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
in
all
of
the
briefs,
your
honor,
until
the
port
authority's
brief
before
this
court
when
they
mentioned
sidewalks,
a
wholly
inappropriate
place
for
which
there
is
no
evidentiary
record
to
support,
and
again
it's
been
the
forum
of
the
interior,
which
is
the
place
where
people
finally
come
to
realize
that
they
have
time,
and
that's
why
the
very
profitable
airport
bloomingdale's
and
other
shops
are
there.
they're
not
there
to
serve
passenger
flow,
but
they're
there
for
economic
reasons
because
they
know
when
people
come
to
rest
they
have
time,
they
wander
around,
and
they
wander
around
to
the
area
that
the
hare
krishnas
are
allowed
to
be
there
now.
i
told
you
that
it's
an
out-of-the-way
spot
near
the
stained
glass
chapel.
that's
the
only
place
at
the
kennedy
airport,
in
that
huge
complex,
that
they're
allowed,
and
they've
been
allowed
to
be
there
for
17-plus
years,
and
there's
been
no
problem.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
we
are
arguing
the
general
proposition
that
airports
as
transportation
crossroads
and
thoroughfares
are,
in
the
first
instance,
to
be
considered
public
forum.
what
i
was
trying--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
let
me
explain,
because
i...
i
obviously--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--well,
i'm
trying
to
be,
you
know,
open
in
this
discussion.
i
did
say
before,
and
ran
into
some
trouble,
that
i
could
conceive
of
the
structure...
i
don't
know
of
any
airport
that
exists
like
this,
and
it
certainly
isn't
the
new
york
airports,
but
you
could
have
a...
you
know,
a
runway
with
some
kind
of
special
security
where
people
are
only
allowed
into
the
parking
lot,
or
into
the
terminal,
where
there
are
no
shops,
where
there's
no
characteristics,
anything
like
the
not
only
new
york
airports
but
the
l.a.
airports
and
the
washington
airports
and
every
airport
that
i
know
of--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--but
i
mean
i
could
theoretically
conceive
of--
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
a.
fisher
yes,
thank
you,
your
honor.
