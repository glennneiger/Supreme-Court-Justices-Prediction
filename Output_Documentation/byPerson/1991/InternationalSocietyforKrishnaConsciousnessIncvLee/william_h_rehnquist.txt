lee
v.
international
society
for
krishna
consciousness.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fisher--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--are
you
making
some
point
that
they
have
waived
that
or
that
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
in
dealing
with
it
on
the
merits?
if
not,
why
do
you
spend
so
much
time
on
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
arguing
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
couldn't
they
limit
it
to
ticketed
passengers?
your
answer
is
because
it's
a
public
forum.
well,
that's
just--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
that's
just
circular,
to
say
that
they
can't
because
it's
a...
what
we
do
is
look
at
the
way
a
thing
exists
and
decide
whether
it's
a
public
forum,
not
say
in
advance
it's
a
public
forum
and
therefore
it
has
to
exist
in
a
certain
way.
why
isn't
your
answer
the
fact
that
they
have
not
done
that?
you
can
close
parks
too,
i
suppose,
but
that
doesn't
stop
it
from
being
a
public
forum.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
there
anything
that--
--what
were
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court?
didn't
the
district
court
make
some
findings
as
to
people...
what
class
of
people
use
the
airport?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
do
people
simply
come
out
to
the
airport
to
shop
even
though
they're
not
meeting
anybody
or
sending
someone
off
or
themselves
traveling?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
district
court
make
findings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
are
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean
if
you
could
generally--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--could
you
address
yourself
to
my
particular
inquiry?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
realize
that,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--let
me
rephrase
my
question,
since
you
apparently
didn't
understand
at
first.
i'm
sorry.
are
there
people
who
go
out
to
the
airport
who
are
not
either
meeting
planes
or
to
greet
someone
or
send
someone
off
on
a
plane
or
to
get
on
a
plane
themselves
or
to
get
off
a
plane
themselves?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
find
on
this
particular
point?
well,
maybe...
maybe--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--maybe
you
could
cover...
then
what
was
your
answer
based
on
that
you
gave
me
just
now
if
it
wasn't
on
a
district
court
finding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
kennedy
airport?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
fisher.
mr
berg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berg.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fisher--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--let
me
ask
you
about
a
procedural
point.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
your
clients
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
favor
of
the
port
authority
also.
they
didn't
send
it
back
for
trial.
it
ruled...
it
kind
of
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
port
authority,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
case
now...
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
view
ended
the
case.
there
was
no
remand
for
hearing--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--or
factual
development.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fisher--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
