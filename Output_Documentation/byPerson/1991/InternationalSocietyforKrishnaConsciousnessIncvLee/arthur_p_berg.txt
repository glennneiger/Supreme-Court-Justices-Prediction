mr.
arthur
p.
berg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
record
in
the
instant
case
establishes
that
virtually
everyone
who
enters
the
terminal
at
kennedy,
la
guardia,
and
newark,
does
so
for
a
purpose
related
to
air
travel,
and
that
was
reflected
in
the
decision
by
the
second
circuit
which
is
found
at
appendix
5
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
cert.--
also,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
the
consistent
port
authority
policy
has
always
been
to
oppose
solicitation
and
distribution
of
literature
in
the
air
terminals.
the
agreement
referred
to
by
mr.
fisher
was
made
between
counsel
and
was
motivated
on
the
part
of
the
port
authority
by
a
litigation
strategy
in
order
to
avoid
the
granting
of
a
preliminary
injunction
which
in
our
view
would
have
granted
greater
access
to
our
facilities
than
the
agreement
which
we
reached,
and
the
agreement...
it
was
always
understood
that
the
agreement
was
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation.
at
a
hearing
before
the
magistrate
after
our
new
regulations
were
adopted
in
1988
mr.
lieberman...
and
this
colloquy
is
found
at
page
498
and
99
of
the
joint
appendix...
mr.
lieberman,
representing
the
krishnas,
said
that
he
just
found
out
about
the
new
regulation
a
few
days
ago,
but
i
don't
really
think
it
changes
anything
because
the
port
in
their
opposing
papers
made
it
very
clear
what
their
policy
was.
that
is,
that
the
airport
terminals
are
a
nonforum,
that
their
policy
is
to
exclude
the
distribution
of
literature
and
solicitation
of
donations
in
the
general
circulation
areas
controlled
by
the
port.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
this
is
page
499
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
this
was
a
hearing
before
the
magistrate.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
excuse
me?
no,
i
was
reading
what
mr.
lieberman
stated.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
conceding
that
the
port
authority
had
not
changed
its
position,
and
that
the
regulations
didn't
alter
the
port
authority's
policy
that
we
have
always
maintained.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
it
would
allow
that
as
long
as
there
was
no
distribution
of
literature
and
as
long
as
it
did
not
create--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
well,
there's
two
words
used.
it
prohibits
continuous
or
repetitive
distribution
of
literature,
and
black's
law
dictionary--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--our
understanding
is
that
it
would
prohibit
a
one-day
activity.
that
would
be
continuous
or
repetitive.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
right,
to
more
than
one
person.
the
idea
was
to
exclude
a
passing
of
a
note,
say,
to
a
companion,
to
make
it
clear
that
it
did
not
apply
to
that
situation,
or
if
one
traveler
said
to
another
traveler,
would
you
like
to
contribute
to
my--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--i
believe
they
do.
the
regulations,
as
i
read
this
court's
decisions
on
nonpublic
fora,
they
must
be
reasonable
and
viewpoint
neutral.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
because
our
experience
has
shown
that
this
type
of
activity
solicitation
and
distribution
of
literature
is
inconsistent
with
the
air
travel
purpose
to
which
the
airports
are
devoted.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
this
court
has
drawn
such
a
distinction,
and
i
agree
that
solicitation
is
more
disruptive
and
that
solicitation
also
has
other
problems
attached
to
it
such
as
it's
conducive
to
fraud,
but
i
also
believe
that
distribution
of
literature
is
also
disruptive
and
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
prohibit
such
activity.
it
has
many
of
the
same
attributes
that
solicitation
does.
it
still
interferes,
creates
congestion,
delay,
interferes
with
people's
passage.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
presumably
with
a
solicitor
you
could
also
say
no,
i'm
not
interested,
and
keep
walking,
but
the
activity
at
the
airports
is...
does
cause
delay
by
stopping
people,
even
if
it
stops
a
person
who
wants
to
discuss
it.
that
backs
up
people
behind
them.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
the
issue,
i
believe,
is
where
this
type
of
activity
is
appropriate.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
i
believe
this
court
in
cornelius
and
other
cases
has
stated
that
even
in
a
nonpublic
forum--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--right.
it
has
said--
[laughter]
it
has
also
said
that
it
need
not
be
the
most
reasonable
nor
the
only
reasonable,
and
i
think
there
is
a
low
level
of
scrutiny
in
a
nonpublic
forum.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
well,
i
believe
that
our
airports
are
typical
of--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--i
believe
that
you
have
to
look
at
each
individual
case
and
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
facility,
the
nature
of
the
facility,
the
characteristics,
and
to
the
extent
that
other
airports
would
be
different
than
our
airport,
you
would
have
to
look
at
that--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--if
an
airport
terminal
was
the
substitute
for
a
public
street,
the
answer
would
be
different,
but
the
concessions
at
major
airports
are
designed
for
the
people
who
are
there
for
an
air
travel
purpose,
not
for
the
general
public.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
it
is
the...
i
think
the
major
consideration
is
the
purpose
of
the
facility
as
shown
by--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--i
mean
the
purpose
to
which
the
property
is
dedicated.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
by
government
fiat
can
dictate
what
the
purpose
is.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
in
this
case
all
the
record
evidence
supports
the
finding
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
air
terminals
at
kennedy,
la
guardia,
and
newark
airports
are
to
facilitate
the
safe,
efficient,
and
convenient
movement
of
air
travel.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that
is
correct.
we
believe
that
it's
demonstrated
that
it's
inconsistent
and
that
such
activity
causes
delay,
congestion,
that
the
people
at
the
airport
are
a
captive
audience--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--well,
i
think
it's
a
disagreement
over
the
controlling
factors
in
public
forum
analysis.
we
believe--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--well,
i
think
he
disagrees
with
the
purpose
of
the
facility,
which
is
uncontested
in
the
record
and
which
was
found
by
the
second
circuit--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--well,
i
think
that
we
have...
we
have
demonstrated
that
all
the
characteristics
of
the
airport
distinguish
it
from
public
streets.
the
location
of
the
airport--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--that
is
correct.
it's
the
characteristics
that
we
disagree
on...
the
location,
the
presence
of
captive
audiences,
we
think
all
these--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--there
is
no
contention
here,
from
what
i
understand,
and
the
second
circuit
found
there
wasn't
a
contention,
that
this
is
a
designated
public
forum.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
no,
your
honor.
this
case
was
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
so
there
was
not
a
trial.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
i
don't
believe
there
should
be
a
remand.
i
think
the
record,
the
affidavits
in
the
record
and
the
uncontested
facts
are
sufficient
for
this
court
to
find
that
the
air
terminals
are
nonpublic
fora
and
that
it's
reasonable
to
prohibit
solicitation
and
distribution
of
literature.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
the
second
circuit
made
a
finding
that
solicitation
would
be
even
more
of
a
problem
here
at
air
terminals
than
it
was
on
the
sidewalk
involved
in
the
kokinda
case.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
they
held
that
because
of
the
nature
of
air
travel,
with
passengers
going
through
the
terminal
buildings,
rushing
to
catch
a
plane
or
going
to
secure
ground
transportation,
carrying
luggage,
that
it
would
be
more
disruptive
here
than
in
kokinda
to
allow
solicitation.
i
think
that
this
case
is
quite
close
to
the
recent
decision
by
this
court
in
kokinda.
in
fact,
i
think
kokinda
was
a
more
difficult
case
than
this
case,
because
in
kokinda
the
government
had
to
overcome
the
strong
presumption
that
any
sidewalk
was
a
public
forum.
in
the
instant
case,
airport
terminals,
unlike
sidewalks,
have
not
long
been
devoted
to
expressive
activity.
significantly,
in
kokinda,
in
the
course
of
holding
that
a
postal
sidewalk
was
not
a
public
forum,
the
court
set
forth
a
number
of
critical
factors,
all
of
which
are
present
in
the
instant
case.
first,
this
court
noted
that
the
government
has
much
greater
flexibility
in
restricting
first
amendment
activity
when
it
is
acting
as
the
operator
of
a
facility
rather
than
as
a
government
regulator.
in
the
instant
case,
as
in
kokinda,
the
port
authority
is
acting
as
the
operator
of
a
facility
rather
than
as
a
regulator.
airports,
like
post
offices,
are
intended
to
be
operated
much
like
private
businesses
and
be
as
self-supporting
as
possible.
a
second
critical
factor
in
kokinda,
and
also
present
here,
is
the
special
purpose
of
the
forum
involved.
this
court
noted
that
the
sidewalk
involved
in
kokinda
was
constructed
solely
to
assist
postal
patrons
to
negotiate
the
space
between
the
parking
lot
and
the
front
door
of
the
post
office
and
not
to
facilitate
the
daily
commerce
and
life
of
a
neighborhood
or
city.
in
the
instant
case,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
air
terminals
is
to
facilitate
air
travel.
as
an
airport
operator,
the
port
authority
has
a
legitimate,
managerial
interest
to
preserve
air
terminals
for
their
air
travel
purpose.
a
final,
critical
factor
set
forth
in
kokinda
which
is
also
present
here
is
the
physical
separation
of
the
airports
from
the
surrounding
community.
in
kokinda,
the
postal
sidewalk
was
held
to-be
akin
to
the
nonpublic
forums
of
the
military...
the
sidewalks
of
the
military
base
involved
in
greer
and
distinguished
from
the
public
forum
sidewalks
surrounding
this
court
involved
in
grace.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
we
do
make
that
argument
in
our
brief
that
even
if
it
would
be
found
to
be
a
public
forum
that
our
regulations
are
valid
because
they
are
narrowly
tailored
and
leave
open
ample
alternative
means
of
communication.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
it
gives
exposure
to
those
people
if
they
wish
to
contribute.
in
the
instant
case
even
more
than
in
kokinda
the
airports
are
an
enclave
clearly
separated
from
the
surrounding
community.
i
think
the
kokinda
decision
is
also
significant
for
what
it
finds
to
be
noncontrolling
factors.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
i
think
the
separation
is
relevant
because
people
are
clearly
aware
that
they
are
entering
a
different
facility.
they
do
not
wander
back
and
forth
between
city
streets
and
the
airport,
so
they're
clearly
aware
of...
the
entrances
and
exits
are
clearly
marked,
so
they
are
aware
that
they
have
entered
a
different
type
of
facility,
a
special
enclave.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
where
the
operator
of
the
facility
has
the
right
to
protect
them
from
annoying
activity,
since
they're--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--the
railroad...
a
railroad
station
would
have
many
of
the
similarities
of
the
airport,
but
they
also
would
have
some
differences.
one
difference
would
be
the
location,
and
there's
a
possibility
that
the
railroad
terminal
located
in
the
center
of
the
city
might
be
used
for
other
purposes,
other
than
rail
travel.
in
kokinda,
this
court
set
forth
a
number
of
factors
that
it
found
to
be
noncontrolling,
and
those
factors
are
the
principal
factors
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
instant
case.
the
court
noted
that
public
forum
analysis
isn't
dictated
by
the
mere
physical
characteristics
of
the
property.
there
a
sidewalk
was
held
not
to
be
a
public
forum.
here,
plaintiffs
attempt
to
argue
that
because
there's
some
physical
similarity
between
the
air
terminals
and
a
public
street,
that
they
should
be
a
public
fora.
the
court
also--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--well,
the
reasonable
basis,
your
honor,
is
that
it
causes
delay,
and
causes
congestion,
and
that
the
passengers
are
a
captive
audience
because
they
must
be
in
the
terminal
and
they
must
take
designated
routes
in
order
to
accomplish
their
air
travel
purpose.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations
are
very
difficult
to
administer,
and
if
it's
a
nonpublic
forum,
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
regulation
be
narrowly
tailored
as
long
as
the
regulation
is
reasonable.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
as...
they
cannot...
they
could
not
distribute
literature
or
solicit
on
port
authority-controlled
areas
of
the
airports.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that's
correct.
inside
their
own
store
they
could
distribute
literature
or
solicit.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that
is
correct.
the--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--the
krishnas
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
lessees,
with
the
airline
lessees
that
they
would
not
solicit
or
distribute
literature
in
their
areas.
they
dismissed
their
action
against
the
airlines
with
prejudice.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
the
issue
has
never
come
up.
i
would
doubt
very
much
that
the
stores
would
permit
them
in
their
areas.
we
have
never
had
to
deal
with
the
problem.
we
would
have
to
examine
the
leases
and
determine
what
our
rights
would
be
under
the
leases.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
that
is
correct,
but
they
would
be
a
captive
audience.
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
well--
mr.
arthur
p.
berg
--it
means
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
be
bothered,
whereas
on
a
public
street
you
have
the
option
of
taking
a
different
route
or
being
in
a
different
location.
this
court
has
acted
to
recognize--
