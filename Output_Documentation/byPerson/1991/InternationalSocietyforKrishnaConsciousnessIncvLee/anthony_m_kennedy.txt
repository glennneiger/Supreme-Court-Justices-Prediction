justice
kennedy
can
you
argue,
counsel,
that
it
is
consistent
with
our
precedents
to
say
that
a
public
forum
exists
in
part
depending
upon
the
uses
to
which
the
government
decides
to
put
the
property
from
time
to
time?
justice
kennedy
so
the
fact
that
the
government
or
the
airport
authority
can
close
the
airport
is
under
that
theory
irrelevant
if
in
fact
it
has
not
done
so.
is
that
the
theory
of
your
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
still
puzzled
as
to
the
answer
to
my
question.
is
it
your
theory
of
the
case
that
a
public
forum
either
exists
or
doesn't
exist
depending
upon
the
uses
to
which
the
government
has
decided
to
put
particular
property?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
trying
to
ask
you
to
focus
on
the
precedents
of
this
court
and
to
ask
you
whether
or
not
we
approach
a
public
forum
by
determining
whether
or
not
property
has
certain
objective
traditional
criteria
like
streets
and
parks
so
that
we
know
it's
a
public
forum
from
that
standpoint,
or
whether
or
not
the
analysis
is
different.
we
look
to
see
property
to
property,
city
to
city,
airport
to
airport,
how
this
particular
airport
or
property
is
now
being
used,
and
if
it's
the
latter,
i'd
like
to
know
what
in
our
cases
supports
that
proposition.
justice
kennedy
yes,
but
the
case
does
turn
on
some
proposed
theory
from
you
as
to
when
we
have
a
public
forum,
and
i
must
say
i
infer
from
your
answer
to
me
and
your
colloquy
with
justice
scalia
that
the
approach
i
suggested
is
not
justified
by
our
cases
and
would
be
considerable
departure
from
our
analysis.
you
seem
to
be
resting
on
the
idea
that
we
know
if
a
public
forum
is
a
public
forum
based
on
tradition.
justice
kennedy
an
airport
is
or
it
isn't,
and
i--
justice
kennedy
--i
am
rather
surprised
that
you
take
that
approach.
justice
kennedy
just
so
i
understand
it,
your
regulation
would
prohibit
handing
out
pamphlets
relating
to
candidates
in
a
presidential
campaign
at
the
time
of
the
general
election.
justice
kennedy
well,
isn't
the
answer
that
it
does
bother
you,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
the
first
amendment
that
bother
you?
that's
what
the
first
amendment
is
for,
is
to
bother
people.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
is
it
reasonable
for
us
to
find
that
solicitation
at
this
airport
causes
a
serious
problem
with
reference
to
the
convenience
of
passengers
and
the
congestion
of
traffic?
justice
kennedy
is
that
uncontested,
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
it
made
a
finding.
