justice
souter
mr.
fisher,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
the
significance
of
your
case
if
the
answer
was
no,
that
nobody
went
out
there
who
was
not
either
going
out
to
get
a
plane
or
meet
somebody,
but
that
they
did
other
things
while
they
were
there?
in
other
words,
obviously
they
don't
have
to
go
to
a
bloomingdale's
in
order
to
meet
a
plane.
wouldn't
your
position
be
just
as
strong
or
just
as
weak,
as
the
case
may
be,
if
the
answer
were
nobody
went
out
there
except
to
meet
a
plane,
but
they
also
when
they
did
go
out
there
they
went
out
to
do
other
things,
and
the
government
in
effect
has
created
a
space
in
which
that
in
fact
is
done?
justice
souter
mr.
berg,
doesn't
reasonable
mean
you
have
to
be
judged
in
some
kind
of
a
functional
term,
and
doesn't
that
prevent
there
being
any
kind
of
a
blanket
rule,
necessarily,
for
all
airports?
if
the
government
constructed
a
comparatively
small
airport
in
the
city
of
washington
and
said
we're
sick
and
tired
of
having
all
of
the
designer
shops
and
the
crowd
that
they
attract,
we're
going
to
have
nothing
but
plain,
narrow
corridors
leading
from
a
front
door
to
the
place
where
you
get
on
the
plane,
wouldn't
the
question
of
reasonable
regulation,
and
wouldn't
the
question
of
whether
a
public
forum
had
been
created
or
not
be
affected
by
simply
the
physical
characteristics
and
the
capacities
of
the
airport
as
distinguished
from
the
kind
of
airports
that
we're
talking
about
here,
in
which
there
is
an
apparent
desire
to,
or
a
compatibility
with
attracting
crowds
for
something
other
than
just
getting
on
and
off
planes?
in
other
words
isn't
there
a
functional
component
to
this
that
forbids
us
to
talk
about
airports
in
the
abstract?
justice
souter
well,
how
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
i
mean,
don't
we
have
to
approach
it
on
a
kind
of
functional
capacity
basis
to
begin
with?
justice
souter
well,
do
you
agree
that
if
an
airport
is
compatible
with
and
has
apparently
been
designed
for
and
used
for
the
kind
of
functions
that
historically
have
taken
place
in
town
centers,
in
courthouse
squares,
in
sidewalks
and
things
like
that,
that
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
a
public
forum
had
been
created
there
would
be
different
from
the
answer
in
the
case
that
i
gave
in
which
a
no-frills
airport
with
narrow
corridors
had
been
created?
wouldn't
the
answer
be
different?
justice
souter
so
that
you
think
that
regardless
of
the
characteristics
of
the
particular
airport
it's
the
intention
of
the
government
that
determines
whether
or
not
it
may
be
treated
as
a
public
forum?
justice
souter
well,
is
purpose...
are
you
talking...
when
you
say
purpose,
do
you
mean
intention,
or
do
you
mean
the
apparent
functional
capacity
of
what
has
been
created?
justice
souter
so
that
if
the
government
says
we're
going
to
build
an
airport,
we're
going
to
have
vast
expanses
of
meeting
places,
shops,
stores,
we're
going
to
have
restaurants
and
invite
the
world
in,
but
we're
doing
this
only
for
the
ultimate
purpose
of
facilitating
air
traffic
and
nothing
which
is
in
our
judgment
incompatible
with
that
can
be
allowed,
that
would
foreclose
the
question
whether
there
was
a
public
forum
or
not.
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
okay.
now,
what's
the
distinction,
then,
between
that
case
in
which
you
don't
allow
the
government
fiat
and
the
case
that
we've
got
before
us?
justice
souter
so
you
rest
in
effect
on
the
factual
findings
as
you
understand
them
that
the
function
of
the
airport
as
an
airport
is
inconsistent
with
leafleting
and
solicitation,
is
that
the
nub
of
it?
justice
souter
so...
and
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you
unduly,
but
the
real
difference,
then,
between
you
and
your
brother
is
a
disagreement
over
the
significance
of
facts
in
this
case,
then.
justice
souter
but
it's
also
a
disagreement
in
fact.
i
understand
him
to
be
saying
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
distributing
leaflets
and
soliciting
change.
justice
souter
mr.
fisher,
may
i--
justice
souter
--i
understand
that
is
a
fact.
i
guess
i
want
to
go
back
to
kind
of
question
1
before
your
time
is
up.
do
you
claim
that
any
airport
is
a
public
forum
without
more?
