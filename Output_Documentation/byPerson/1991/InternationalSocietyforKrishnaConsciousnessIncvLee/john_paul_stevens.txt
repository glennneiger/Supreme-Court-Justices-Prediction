justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
berg,
you
had
this
long
history
under
the
sort
of
tentative
settlement
or
stand-by
agreement,
or
whatever
you
might
call
it.
did
the
district
court
make
any
findings
about
the
extent
to
which
there
was
in
fact
interruption
with
access
to
the
planes
and
the
kind
of
thing
that
troubles
you?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
we
should
just
presume
that
there's
going
to
be
all
this
crowding
and
interruption,
or
should
there
be
a
remand
for
hearings
on
that
issue?
justice
stevens
i
think
you
have
the
same
opportunity
to
collect
from
somebody
carrying
a
lot
of
baggage
at
the
terminal
in
the
street
as
you
do
once
they
get
in
to
check
their
baggage.
justice
stevens
would
you
help
me
on
that
separation
from
the
rest
of
the
community?
why
is
that
relevant?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
where
they're
protected
from
this
kind
of
activity.
justice
stevens
would
your
argument
be
the
same
with
regard
to
railroad
stations
if
they
were
publicly
owned?
