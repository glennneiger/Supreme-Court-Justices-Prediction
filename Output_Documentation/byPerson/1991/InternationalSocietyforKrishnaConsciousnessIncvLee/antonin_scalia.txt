justice
scalia
what
jurisprudence
is
that?
are
things
that
don't
make
sense
jurisprudence?
this
is
either
a
public
forum,
in
which
case--
justice
scalia
--this
is
either
a
public
forum,
in
which
case
things
that
make
sense
have
to
be
allowed,
or
it's
not
a
public
forum,
in
which
even
things
that
make
sense
don't
have
to
be
allowed.
i
mean,
that's
simply
the
issue,
isn't
it...
whether
it's
a
public
forum
or
not,
and--
justice
scalia
--i
don't
see
how
you
can
answer
justice
white
to
say
that
the
airports
can
keep
everybody
out
except
ticketed
passengers
and
yet
still
maintain
that
it's
a
public
forum.
justice
scalia
i
don't
care
what
it
would
look
like.
you
acknowledge
they
can
do
it.
justice
scalia
well,
if
it's
not
a
public
forum...
i
mean,
you
couldn't
do
that
with
the
public
streets,
could
you?
you
couldn't
say
nobody
on
the
public
streets.
justice
scalia
they're
designed
to
attract
people.
you
mean,
they're
trying
to
get
more
people
into
kennedy
airport?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
go
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
kennedy
airport.
[laughter]
but
i
don't
know
anybody
that
goes
there--
justice
scalia
--just
to
be
part
of
the
crowd.
justice
scalia
perhaps
with
the
consent
of
the
people
who
owned
the
transportation
centers.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
cases
that
show
that
these
people
were
sought
to
be
excluded
and
the
court
said
no,
you
can't
exclude
them
from,
let's
say,
penn
station,
which
was
privately
owned?
justice
scalia
i
know,
and
private
hotels
let
the
gideon
society
put
bibles
in
their
rooms,
too,
but
that
doesn't
make
that
a
public
forum,
just
because
they
choose
to
allow
that.
justice
scalia
and
that's
what
a
public
forum
is.
you
have
to
let
the
person
jump
up
on
a
soap
box
and
talk
about
the
most
absurd
and
in
the
view
of
the
person
who
owns
the
place
the
most
objectionable
matter.
justice
scalia
mr.
berg,
are
you
sure
you
want
to
concede
that
the
first
amendment
requires
that
even
in
nonpublic
forums
any
limitations
you
impose
have
to
be
reasonable,
it's
sort
of
an
overarching
reasonableness
requirement
for
all
areas
that
are
at
all
publicly
owned
or
publicly
regulated,
a
sort
of
general
federal
administrative
prescription
that
every
rule
has
to
be
reasonable?
justice
scalia
you
can't
have
content
discrimination,
i
suppose,
but
does
every
restriction
have
to
be
a
reasonable
restriction?
now,
i...
that's
a...
i--
--well,
at
least
that's
what
this
court
has
said,
right?
justice
scalia
oh,
he
disagrees
with
more
than
that.
he
says
that
an
airport
is
a
traditional
public
forum.
that
is,
whether
you
want
it
to
be
exclusively
for
travelers
or
not,
it
can't
be
exclusively
for
travelers.
he
says
it's
like
public
streets.
he
says
it's
like
public
parks.
you
cannot
stop
that
from
being
a
public
forum.
i
thought
that
was
his
argument,
that
airports
you
must
allow
outsiders
into
airports,
you
must
allow
literature
to
be
passed
out,
because
it's
like
the
public
streets.
isn't
that
more
than
differing
on
the
facts
of
what
you've
allowed
in
this
particular
airport?
justice
scalia
but
he's
making
a
fundamental
argument
that
does
not
hinge
upon
what
you
in
this
particular
airport
have
in
fact
allowed
the
public
to
do.
he's
saying
all
airports,
just
like
all
public
streets,
must
allow
these
things.
isn't
that
fundamentally
different
from
your
contention,
and
different
on
something
other
than
the
facts?
justice
scalia
facts
have
to
do
with
whether
this
is
a
designated
public
forum,
where...
they
have
to
do
with
whether,
even
though
it
isn't
a
traditional
public
forum,
you
have
chosen
to
make
it
that,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
a
separate
question,
and
maybe
we
ought
to
discuss
the
two
separately.
justice
scalia
you
allow
solicitation
and
distribution
of
literature
on
the
sidewalks
anyway,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
so
why
isn't
that
enough,
anyhow?
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
all
the
rest
of
the
argument?
isn't
that
a
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction?
justice
scalia
mr.
berg,
let's
assume
that
the
airport
is
not
a
traditional
public
forum
but
that
what
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
it's
in
effect
a
designated
public
forum,
that
you've
allowed
some
forum-type
activity
and
you
should
therefore
have
to
allow
this:
i
mean,
you
have
stores,
you
have
shops,
you
have
a
lot
of
those
other
things.
now,
you
say
you
need
a
reasonable
basis
for
excluding
this
solicitation
and
this
passing
out
of
literature.
what
is
the
reasonable
basis?
your
passengers
don't
like
it,
it's
annoying
to
them.
is
that
a
reasonable
basis?
justice
scalia
well,
couldn't
those
problems
be
solved
by
restricting
the
solicitors
to
certain
areas?
you
wouldn't
have
to
keep
them
out
of
the
building
entirely,
would
you?
justice
scalia
it's
in
the
regulations,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
you
say
the
first
instance.
what's
the
second
instance?
justice
scalia
are
they
public
forums
or
are
they
not?
justice
scalia
--mr.
fisher.
