justice
stevens
well,
there's
another
answer,
too,
isn't
there?
what
causes
the
clock
to
start
running
under
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
stevens
in
justice
scalia's
example
there's
no
sixth
amendment
issue
at
all.
justice
stevens
mr.
mueller,
do
you
think
the
concerns
that
underlie
the
policy
of
repose
and
the
statutes
of
limitation
have
any
relevance
at
all
to
this
case?
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
about
evaluative
factor
number
1.
is
that
even
relevant,
that
there...
that
some
appointed
time
should
come
when
a
citizen
no
longer
has
to
worry
about
things
that
happened
long
ago?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
asking
you
to--
justice
stevens
--you
don't
think
it
should
play
any
part
in
the
analysis?
justice
stevens
well,
none
of
that--
--i
take
it
the
statute...
the
statute
had
not
run
here
because
he
was
a
few...
he
was
abroad?
justice
stevens
of
course,
they
knew
where
his
mother
was,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
well,
the
government
never
tries
to
give
somebody
notice
in
advance
that
we're
going
to
try
and
catch
you
later
on,
do
they?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
that's
kind
of
an
absurd
idea,
isn't
it?
you
go
out
and
give
them
notice...
you've
been
indicted.
a
few
months
from
now
we'll
try
and
arrest
you?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
tapes
again?
i
guess
nobody
knows
what's
on
the
tapes,
but
if
you
rely
in
part
on
the
fact
that
he
should
be
responsible
for
bringing
forth
any
relevant
information
on
the
tapes,
wouldn't
that
be
somewhat
harder
after
8
years
than
it
would
be
probably
after
they
were
transcribed?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you
think
that
argument
is
consistent
with
the
court's
holding
in
the
strunk
case?
justice
stevens
well,
the
strunk
case
was
one
in
which,
during
the
period
that
he
was...
the
delay
occurred
he
was
incarcerated
on
another
offense,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
we'll
chop
that
off,
a
period
of
double
service,
off
of
the
remedy
instead
of
dismissing
the
indictment,
and
the
court
reversed
unanimously
and
said
no,
you...
the
remedy
regardless
of
the
penalty
and
the
amelioration
of
the
previous
penalty
through
the
delay.
the
remedy
is
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
you
don't
look
at
the
amount
of
the
punishment,
the
kind
of
factor
you're
looking
at
here.
justice
stevens
so
in
analyzing
the
case
we
should
just
assume
he
would
have
gotten
precisely
the
same
sentence
when
he
was
tried--
justice
stevens
--and
it
would
be
the
same?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
sum
up
in
this...
sum
up
your
argument
in
this
way?
you've
agreed
that
the
other
side
does
not
have
to
prove
prejudice,
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
three
other
factors
don't
add
up
to
enough
in
the
defendant's
favor
to
justify
any
relief?
