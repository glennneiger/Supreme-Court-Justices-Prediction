justice
kennedy
well,
does
it
really
make
that
much
difference
that
he
was...
other
than,
i
suppose,
the
inherent
equities
of
the
case?
suppose
he
was
out
robbing
banks?
you'd
have
about
the
same
argument
here
anyway,
wouldn't
you?
justice
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
if
we
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
could
you
argue
that
a
speedy
trial
is
either
speedy
or
not?
it's
irrelevant
that
he
has
anguish,
it's
irrelevant
that
he
has
prejudice,
and
it's
irrelevant
that
he's
lost
or
not
lost
liberty.
he's
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
whether
or
not
any
of
those
factors
exist.
justice
kennedy
did
you
make
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
district
court?
justice
kennedy
was
the
defendant
a
participant
on
all...
on
all
of
these
tapes?
justice
kennedy
you're
arguing
that
you
have
a
stronger
case
because
he
did
not
know
of
the
indictment?
justice
kennedy
your
case
is
weaker
because
he
did
not
know
of
the
indictment?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
the
citizens
of
this
country
do
have
some
interest
in
assurance
that
there
are
not
pending
indictments
against
them
that
they
don't
know
about.
it's
a
valid
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
you
were
negligent--
justice
kennedy
--you
were
negligent
but
reasonable?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
were...
you
were
in
your
brief.
i
thought
you
were
really
dancing
away
from
the
trial
court's
findings,
and
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
said
he's
stuck
with
the
finding,
and
i
think
you
are,
too.
