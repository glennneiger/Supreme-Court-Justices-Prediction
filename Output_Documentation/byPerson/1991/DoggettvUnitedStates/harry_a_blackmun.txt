justice
blackmun
--am
i
correct,
mr.
sheppard,
that
he
hasn't
been
in
any
trouble
in
this
latter
period
of
his
life?
justice
blackmun
what
kind
of
a
sentence
did
he
receive?
justice
blackmun
that
does
not
go
my
question
about
the
sentence.
you
concede
he
was
in
drugs
in
the
early
years?
justice
blackmun
rather
a
light
sentence,
don't
you
think?
justice
blackmun
everything
prior
to
22
is
a
youthful
mistake?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
it's
pure
speeulation,
but
i
wonder
if
the
judge
here
in
a
way
didn't
take
the
passage
of
time
into
consideration
in
fixing
sentence?
