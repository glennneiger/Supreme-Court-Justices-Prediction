chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-857,
marc
gilbert
doggett
v.
united
states.
mr.
sheppard?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sheppard,
you
presented
two
questions
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
and
both
seem
to
assume
that
there
was
no
actual
prejudice
shown
and
that
there
need
not
be.
isn't
that
the
way
we
take
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
found
negligence
but
no
bad
faith?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
being
very
helpful,
mr.
sheppard.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
don't
take
these
cases
to
resolve
individual
factual
disputes,
generally.
you
raise
no
question
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
finding
negligence
rather
than
bad
faith.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
they
did.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
we
would
expect
to
get,
i
think,
from
you
on
this
court
is
a
legal
argument
that
you
don't
have...
the
defendant
shouldn't
have
to
prove
actual
prejudice
when
the
other
factors
were
weighed
the
way
they
were.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
hasn't--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
think
it's
been
interspersed
with
a
lot
of
other
things.
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
say
bad
faith
equals
prejudice
certainly
is
equating
two
words
that
ordinarily
are
not.
if
bad
faith
refers
to
the
state
of
mind
with
which
an
actor
goes
about
doing
something,
prejudice
refers
to
the
effect
of
something
on
someone
else.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sheppard.
mr.
mueller,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
tolled
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
yeah.
you
indicated
that
the
length
of
time
was
not
articulated
in
the
constitution.
i
take
it
none
of
the
concerns
you
rest
upon
are
reflected
in
the
constitution
either?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
your
intent
to
leave
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
on
the
very
much
ad
hoc,
fact-bound
state
in
which
it
now
is,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mueller.
mr.
sheppard,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
1
minute
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-857,
doggett
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
