mr.
william
j.
sheppard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
in
a
situation
where
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
herein,
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
an
indictment
for
a
period
of
8-1/2
years
prior
to
being
arrested.
for
the
last
6
years
of
that
8-1/2
years,
it
was
clear
that
mr.
doggett
was
available
to
the
push
of
a
button,
running
a
credit
check,
to
determine
his
whereabouts.
eight-and-a-half
years
after
his
indictment
the
united
states
marshals
service,
in
conducting
an
operation
entitled
want
ii,
which
commenced
on
september
1
of
1988,
pushed
a
button
on
a
credit
bureau
computer
in
the
savannah
office
of
the
marshal's
office
and
within
5
minutes
found
that
marc
doggett
resided
in
reston,
virginia,
where
he
had
been
residing
openly,
freely,
and
above-board
for
the
last
6
years.
the
government's
efforts
immediately
after
the
indictment
of
mr.
doggett
demonstrates
bad
faith
which
constitutes
prejudice.
shortly
after
mr.
doggett's
indictment,
two
state
officials,
at
the
request
of
the
jacksonville,
florida,
dea,
went
to
his
parents'
home
in
north
carolina.
mr.
doggett's
mother
is
a
colombian
national
who's
been
married
to
an
american
citizen
for
many
years
and
has
three
children.
these
two
state
officials,
at
the
request
of
the
federal
government,
dropped
by
her
house
one
time
in
8-1/2
years
to
determine
where
mr.
doggett
was.
mrs.
doggett
immediately
notified
these
officers
that
he
had
left
for
colombia,
and
indeed
gave
him
the
flight
number
of
his
airplane
in
miami,
florida,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
updating
his
passport
on
his
way.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
the
record
is
absolutely
clear,
and
both
the
magistrate,
the
district
court,
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
found
that
mr.
doggett
had
no
knowledge
of
his
indictment
through
his
mother
or
anyone.
indeed,
the
united
states
in
the
plea
agreement
entered
into
with
mr.
doggett
stated
that
mr.
doggett
had
no
knowledge
of
the
indictment
and
indeed
the
two
co-defendants,
who
were
apprehended
and
tried
in
1980,
had
had
no
contact
with
mr.
doggett.
so
the
record
is
without
question
that
mr.
doggett
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
this
indictment.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
no.
i
do
not
accept
that.
the
reason
i
do
not
accept
that
is
that
probably
a
year-and-a-half
after
mr.
doggett
was
indicted
he
was
arrested
in
the
country
of
panama
and
he
was
incarcerated
there
for
8
months.
during
that
8-month
period,
the
dea
knew
that
he
was
there.
the
state
department
visited
mr.
doggett
on
periodic
basis
during
that
8-month
period.
unfortunately,
the
state
department
and
the
dea
didn't
communicate
with
each
other,
and
no
one,
including
the
state
department
officials
that
visited
him
on
numerous
occasions,
gave
him
notice
of
the
indictment.
thereafter,
he
was
released
in
1982
and
returned
to
this
country
after
a
couple
of
months
visiting
family
in
colombia.
as
long
as
2
years...
32
months,
38
months,
the
dea
agent
in
jacksonville,
based
on
information
that
he
had
received
in
1981,
fabricated
three
dea
6
reports
stating
that
marc
doggett
was
still
incarcerated
in
the
country
of
panama.
these
fabricated
reports
caused
the
united
states
to
exert
no
further
effort
to
obtain
the
apprehension
of
mr.
doggett,
to
his
detriment.
mr.
doggett
returned
to
the
united
states,
using
his
own
name,
through
jfk
airport
in
new
york
city
and
returned
to
north
carolina
for
a
brief
period
of
time
living
with
a
grandmother,
and
then
became
married,
obtained
an
aa
degree,
has
had
numerous
jobs,
had
many
credit
cards,
bought
two
houses,
paid
united
states
income
tax,
and
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
identity,
which
is--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
would
certainly
concede
that,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
would
also
state
that
the
same
precedent
from
which
those
two
concerns
were
articulated
also
communicated
a
third
concern,
and
that
is
impairment
of
the
defense
of
a
person.
further,
the
same
cases,
barker--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--indeed,
the
courts
below
did
not
find
actual
prejudice.
however,
we
submit
that
that
was
an
erroneous
analysis
of
this
record,
and
i'd
like
to
communicate
why
mr.
doggett
was
prejudiced.
number
one,
there
were
17
tapes
made
in
the
1979,
'80
time
period
when
this
case
was
investigated.
mr.
doggett
was
involved
in...
very
peripherally
in
a
large...
what
turned
out
to
be
a
large
cocaine
transaction.
the
government
in
their
brief,
and
i
suspect
in
their
argument,
will
attempt
to
lead
you
to
believe
that
he
was
involved
in
a
40-kilogram
cocaine
transaction.
that
would
belie
the
record
if
one
reviews
the
record
closely.
he
pled...
entered
a
conditional
plea
involving
5.7
grams
of
cocaine,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
affirming
the
conviction
of
the
two
co-defendants
in
1982
explicitly
indicated
that
there
was
no
involvement
by
mr.
doggett.
now,
the
prejudice
that
mr.
doggett
suffered
was,
number
one,
there
were
17
tapes
that
were
missing,
and
8-1/2
years
later
it's
hard
to
say
(1)
were
the
tapes
totally
blank,
(2)
whose
voices
were
on
the
tape,
(3)
did
the
content
of
the
tapes...
would
they
have
exonerated
mr.
doggett?
another
factor
was
that
the
moving
force
in
this
investigation
was
a
confidential
informant
named
ivan
cifuentes.
ivan
cifuentes
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case
had
not
been
communicated
with
by
the
dea
for
a
1-1/2
year
period,
and
as
dea
agent
driver
stated,
he,
along
with
the
tapes,
was,
quote,
"missing
in
action",
end
quote.
the
court...
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
that
witness
was
available.
if
the
eleventh
circuit
reviewed
the
record
closely,
as
was
their
obligation,
they
would
have
not
made
that
finding,
because
he
was
not
available.
he
had
entered
the
witness
protection
program,
had
voluntarily
withdrawn,
and
agent
driver
had
not
communicated
with
him
or
had
any
information
of
his
whereabouts
for
at
least
a
year-and-a-half
period.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
he
has
not
been
in
any
trouble
other,
your
honor,
than
three
civil
traffic
infractions,
which
we
submit
would
have
laid
the
paper
trail
that,
if
the
government
was
carrying
out
its
due
diligence
obligation
to
apprehend
fugitives,
would
have
led
them
directly
to
him
by
plugging
them
into
a
computer
to
determine
what
his
driving
record
is,
but
he
had
absolutely
no
criminal
charges
whatsoever.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
he
received
a
$1,000
fine,
a
three-year
probationary
term,
and
most
devastatingly,
a
felony
conviction
which
he
will
carry
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
due
to
the
actions
of
the
united
states
and
its
failure
to
carry
out
its
duty.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
respectfully,
i
don't
know
that
his
clean
record
or
his...
if
he
had
engaged
in
criminal
activity
is
the
proper
focus
of
the
analysis.
we
respectfully
submit
that,
compatible
with
the
precedent
of
this
court,
and
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
inquiry,
the
cases
that
set
up
the
concerns
also
don't
foreclose
consideration
of
other
concerns.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
we
are
submitting
a
rule
that
isn't
quite
as
radical
as
looking
at
just
the
duration
of
time.
we
submit
for
this
court's
consideration
kind
of
a
fine-tuning
of
this
court's
precedent,
where,
as
in
a
case
like
this,
the
time
of
the
delay
from
indictment
to
arrest
exceeds
the
period
of
time
contained
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
5
years,
and
that
the
defendant
does
not
know
of
the
existence
of
the
charges
against
him
and
therefore
is
not
a
fugitive,
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
required
to
show
prejudice.
now,
we're
not
asking
for
a
per
se
rule.
we're
just
submitting
that
it
is
impossible
for
marc
doggett
to
go
back
8-1/2
years
later
and
prove
what
he
doesn't
know,
and
that
is
that
he
was
prejudiced.
and
we
respectfully--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--conceded,
your
honor.
absolutely
conceded.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
not
a
light
sentence
to
pay
the
debt
for
a
youthful
mistake
when
you're
32
years
old.
eight-and-a-half
years,
or
by
the
time
we
got
to
that
point
in
the
proceedings,
9-1/2
years
from
the
alleged
conduct.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
case
of
doggett,
whose
upbringing
because
of
his
parents'
marriage,
of
a
foreign
national
from
colombia
and
an
american
ph.d.
physicist
in
this
country,
which
exposed
him
to
colombia,
going
to
see
his
grandmother
and
his
elderly
aunts
throughout
his
youth,
yes.
and
i
think
congress,
prior
to
its
abolition
of
the
youth
corrections
act
and
the
young
adult
offender
act
felt
that
age
22
was
not
too
old
for
special
consideration
of
individuals
who
had
made
youthful
mistakes
in
becoming
involved
in
criminal
activity.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
would
be
less
than
forthright
with
the
court
to
suggest
that
that
is
probably
an
appropriate
observation.
his
co-defendant
received
3
years
and
was
sentenced
at
the
same
time.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--absolutely.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
you
suggest
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
or
the
united
states
authorities
in
this
case
was
negligence,
which...
i'm
stuck
with
that
finding
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
but
it
belies
the
record.
marc
doggett--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--assuming
it
was
negligence,
then
i
think
it
would
rise
up
to
the
level
of
whether
the
defendant
could
demonstrate
some
prejudice,
and
i
respectfully
submit
on
this
record
we
have.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
guess
the
best
thing
i
could
say
about
your
hypothetical,
it
was
4
years
and
2
months,
and
this
is
8
years
and
6
months,
which
is
twice
as
long.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
well,
absolutely.
the
indictment
under
marion--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--that's
absolutely
correct,
and
the
indictment
starts
it
running
here--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
thank
you,
justice.
[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--indeed,
and
thank
you
for
thanking
him,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
think
you
take
it
that
way,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
by
what
i
guess
i
would
call
a
bright
line
rule
is
that
in
this
extreme
delay
cases,
and
especially
when
there
is
a
demonstration
on
the
record
of
bad
faith
by
the
government--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--they
found
negligence,
but
on
a
record
that
demonstrated
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
in
1981--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--i
apologize.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
didn't
frame
it
specifically
that
way,
but
i
believe
that
the
first
issue
when
we
raised
it
of
whether
the...
when
the
factors
in
barker
are
balanced
as
a
whole,
and
even
the
eleventh
circuit
found
that
two
of
those
four
factors
inured
to
the
benefit
of
doggett.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
one
was
neutral,
and
one
we
did
not
prove
prejudice.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
that's
exactly
my
argument--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i...
two--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--assuming--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--justice
scalia
said
assume
negligence,
which--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--and
as
the
chief
justice
points
out,
i'm
stuck
with
that
record.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
and
i
accept
that.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
absolutely
not,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
by
my
bright
line
rule
is
that
in
an
8-1/2
year
delay,
and
especially
if
you
look
at
the
record,
dea
agent
driver
testified
at
the
hearing
that
after
1985,
when
he
coincidentally
was
transferred
to
panama
and
learned
3-1/2
years
later
that
mr.
doggett
was
in
panama,
that
he
could
not
recall
what,
if
anything,
he
did
as
a
result
of
that
information.
he
couldn't
recall
what
he
did...
a
trained
individual,
trained
to
make...
preserve
notes
so
that
he
could
have
refreshed
recollections.
it
is
inequitable
to
put
that
burden
of
proving
prejudice
on
the
defendant.
this
court,
in
more
v.
arizona,
emphatically
held
that
it
is
not
one
of
the
requirements
under
the
barker
test--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--my
answer
to
their
claim
of
no
prejudice
is
that
there
is
prejudice.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
yes,
and
i
have
17
missing
tapes,
i
have
a
missing
critical
witness.
this
individual--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--prejudice
at
the
trial.
additionally--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--no.
there
is
further
prejudice.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
the
interruption
of
someone's
life,
8-1/2
years
later,
is
prejudicial.
a
young
person,
for
example,
who
at
that
time
was
eligible
for
treatment
under
the
young
offender
act,
which
is
very
preferential
treatment,
had
he
been
put
on
notice
while
he
was
incarcerated
for
8
months
in
the
panamanian
jail,
when
he
was
still
eligible
for
treatment
under
that
act,
if
the
government
had
put
him
on
notice
he
could
have
triggered
a
treaty,
a
prisoner-transfer
treaty
to
this
country,
to
allow
him
to
serve
his
time
here
and
also
to
get
on
with
what
he's
going
to
have
to
get
on
with,
and
that
is
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
yes.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
the
tapes,
justice
souter,
are
some
dea
6
reports
that
were
prepared,
and
i
think...
and
it
didn't
deal
with
all...
there
were
17
tapes.
it
didn't
deal
with
all
of
the
tapes.
most
of
those
tapes
dealt
with
the
later
transactions,
and
the
only
tapes
that
dealt
with
my
client
dealt
with
5.7
grams
of
cocaine,
so
that
i
think
that
arguably
those
tapes
could
have
shown
his
very
peripheral
involvement
in
maybe
a
separate
conspiracy.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
was
his
voice
on
those
tapes.
i've
never
heard
the
tapes.
they're
not
transcripts
of
the
tapes,
they
are
just
summaries
of
the
tapes
made
contemporaneous
by
somebody,
but
they
do
not
tell
me
the
things
that
i
know
as
an
advocate
rendering
effective
assistance
of
counsel
that
i
have
to
know
about
tapes
in
order
to
properly
advise
my
client
and
to
defend
those
tapes.
tapes
are
very,
very
evasive
and
elusive
type
of
evidence,
as
recent
trials
show.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
perhaps
if
that
was
all
in
the
record
that
there
was,
that
would
have
been
enough.
i
wouldn't
really
want
to
make
that
concession.
but
after
all,
the
united
states
state
department
was
located
exactly
two
blocks
from
the
dea
office
in
panama
for
8
months,
and
the
dea...
i
mean,
the
state
department
employees
of
this
government
were
going
to
see
marc
doggett
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
they
do,
under
barker.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
think
it's
important
to
recall
the
record
that
there
was
one
trip
to
his
mother,
who
i
indicated
earlier
is
not
an
american.
she
is
a
colombian,
and
they
communicated
to
her,
and
there's
a
great
dispute
in
the
record
and
some
confusion
in
the
record
about
what
she
was
told.
the
dea
agent
testified
that
he
was
told
by
these
two
state
officers,
who
never
testified
below,
that
they
told
her
that
he
was
wanted.
she
testified
differently.
so
there's
a
conflict.
of
course,
the
government
wants
it
both
ways.
respectfully,
they
never
made
another
trip
to
that...
to
that
familial
home
over
the
next
8-1/2
years,
and
those
folks
were
there,
and
had
they
come
back
2-1/2
years
later
i
suspect
that
we
wouldn't
be
here,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
government
had
carried
out
its
duty
as
we
understand
that
duty
in
smith
v.
hooey
to
in
due
diligence
seek
to
apprehend
fugitives.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
and
the
question
is,
it's
on
this
record
with
their...
the
proximity
to
mr.
doggett
for
the
8
months
that
he
was
in
panama,
is
dropping
by
his
house
and
having
a
chat
with
his
mother
adequate
notice,
and
respectfully,
for
any
other
legal
proceedings,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
not
be,
sir.
it
is
inadequate
based
on
the
opportunities
that
were
available
to
the
government.
they
bumbled
around
putting
him
in
different
computers,
not
knowing
that
he
would
automatically
be
deleted
from
some
of
those
computers.
concededly,
when
he
came
through
jfk
he
was
in
the
nci
computer.
i
thought
it
interesting
in
the
prior
argument
before
lunch,
when
counsel
for
the
government
told
you
that
certainly
we
would
know
if
people
came
to
our
shores.
well,
if
that's
the
case
and
the
government
says
that,
why
doesn't
marc...
didn't
marc
doggett
get
arrested
in
1982?
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
the
people
that
were
responsible
for
arresting
him,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
impacted
on
the
other
government
entities
actions
by
fabricating
three
reports
24
months
after
the
fact,
32
months
after
the
fact,
and
36
months
after
the
fact.
and
these
fabricated
reports
contribute
to
a
prejudiced
analysis.
you
cannot
be
free
from
prejudicial
conduct
to
others
if
you
act
in
bad
faith,
and
i
think
that
the
core
of
that
was
candidly
testified
to
by
that
dea
agent.
we
asked
him.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i'm
suggesting
that
bad
faith
equals
prejudice
when
you
take
the
collective
bad
faith
actions
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
easy
way
for
this
court--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--in
1985,
3
years
after
marc
doggett
left
panama,
the
dea
agent
who
was
the
case
agent
in
jacksonville,
florida,
coincidentally
got
transferred
there.
when
he
got
there,
there
wasn't
one
shred
of
paper
in
panama
on
marc
doggett.
it
had
been
destroyed.
so
maybe
my
choice
of
words
is
wrong,
but
if
that
file
were
available...
and
it
wasn't
marc
doggett
that
destroyed
it;
it
was
the
government
that
destroyed
it...
perhaps
he
could
come
forward
and
articulate
the
prejudice
that
the
government
contends
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
articulate,
despite
moore
v.
arizona,
despite
barker
v.
wingo.
neither...
one
case
says
prejudice
is
not
absolutely
required;
the
other
one
says
emphatically
it's
not
required.
the
reason
we
articulate
to
this
court
a
very
narrow
rule...
and
it
would
enhance
the
public's
interest
in
speedy
trial.
this
idea
of
a
speedy
trial
is
not
just
for
a
criminal
defendant,
it
is
for
the
public.
if
you
follow
our
bright
line
rule,
it
will
give
the
government
the
incentive
not
to
bungle
old
cases,
and
that
incentive
is
important.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
when,
as
in
a
case
such
as
this,
that
the
time
of
the
delay
from
indictment
to
arrest
exceeds
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
prove
prejudice,
and
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
prove
no
prejudice.
and
we
respectfully
submit--
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
--no,
no.
absolutely.
no.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
a
component
of
our
rule...
and
i
thought
i'd
articulated
it.
let
me
state
it
one
more
time.
and
i
submit
that
it
would
eliminate
a
lot
of
the
impossible
arguments
that
occur
in
these
old
cases,
and
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
government,
and
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
individual
criminal
defendant.
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
a
defendant
has
no
knowledge...
when
he
has
no
knowledge
that
he
has
been
indicted
or
charged,
and
the
time
equal
to
the
statute
of
limitations
passes
prior
to
his
arrest,
then
he
is
not
required
to
prove
prejudice,
and
indeed
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
prove
no
prejudice.
no
one
is
harmed,
everyone
is...
individual
and
respective
interest
is
enhanced,
and
i
urge
the
court
to
adopt
that
rule
and
reverse
this
conviction.
mr.
william
j.
sheppard
i
think
not.
thank
you.
