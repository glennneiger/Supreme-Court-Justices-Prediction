justice
o'connor
mr.
sheppard,
cases
from
this
court
dealing
with
the
speedy
trial
clause
have
identified
two
concerns
that
are
behind
the
provisions
of
the
clause.
one
is
the
anxiety
factor
of
someone
who
is
aware
of
the
indictment,
and
nothing
has
happened,
and
secondly
the
loss
of
liberty
pending
trial
if
someone's
incarcerated.
now,
we
don't
have
either
of
those
things
at
play
here.
justice
o'connor
no,
but,
did
the
courts
below
in
this
case
find
that
both
the
state
and
the
defendant
were
equally
affected
by
the
absence
of
any
evidence
as
a
result
of--
justice
o'connor
well,
are
you
asking
us
to--
justice
o'connor
--do
that?
are
you
asking
us
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
under
your
theory,
would
length
of
the
delay
and
government
negligence
alone,
those
two
factors,
ever,
in
any
case,
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
speedy
trial
clause?
justice
o'connor
the
delay...
a
long
delay
and
government
negligence--
justice
o'connor
--those
two
factors.
justice
o'connor
what's
missing?
justice
o'connor
well,
assuming
he's
asserting
the
right,
of
course.
justice
o'connor
but
you
think
the
crucial
thing
is
prejudice
in
every
case?
justice
o'connor
and
it
wouldn't--
--so
it
is--
--i'm
sorry.
it
is
possible,
then,
that
length
of
delay
and
government
negligence
alone
will
be
enough,
if
we
follow
moore?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
really
want
us
to
reexamine
that
question,
surely?
i
mean,
don't
we
take
this
case
with
the
finding
that
the
government
was
negligent?
you
didn't
petition
for
certiorari
in
a
cross-petition.
why
would
we
want
to
upset
that?
justice
o'connor
is
there
no
prejudice
in
your
view
by
having
the
defendant's
life
uprooted
after
so
long
a
time?
you
find
that
that
can
never
be
prejudicial?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
mueller,
was
there
any
assurance
in
connection
with
taking
this
plea
that
it
was
without
prejudice
to
the
right
to
litigate
this
question
of
speedy
trial
violation?
justice
o'connor
and
wouldn't
your
argument
undercut
that
agreement?
i
mean--
justice
o'connor
--no?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
you
suggest
a
blanket
rule,
that
if
there's
a
guilty
plea
that
cuts
you
off,
then
it
certainly
isn't
going
to
do
any
good
to
preserve
the
right
to
litigate
it,
is
it?
