justice
white
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
if
you
accepted
the
finding
that
there
was
only
negligence
you
would
have
to
prove
negligence...
or
have
to
prove
prejudice.
justice
white
i
thought
that's
what
you'd
said
a
minute
ago.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--and
therefore
are
you
stuck
with
the
notion
that
it
must
be
you
who
must
prove--
justice
white
--well,
the
government...
the
government
here
argues
that
no
matter
whose
burden
it
is,
even
if
it's
theirs,
they've
proved
that
there's
just
no
kind
of
prejudice
that
should
be
cognizable
in
a
case
like
this,
since
you
didn't
know
anything
about
this
indictment.
and
what
would
have
been
your...
what's
your
answer
to
their
claim
of
no
prejudice?
justice
white
you
at
least
have
to...
you
at
least
have
to
get
up
to
even-steven
with
them,
don't
you?
justice
white
this
is
on...
this,
then,
is
prejudice
at
the
trial?
justice
white
you're
back
to
the
bad
faith
argument.
justice
white
will
you
give
me
your
bright
line
rule
again.
justice
white
are
you...
are
you
in
complete
agreement
with
the
analysis
below?
justice
white
i
didn't
think
you
were.
justice
white
i
mean
with
the...
with
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
and
i'm
sure
you'll
let
us
know
about
that.
[laughter]
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
the
length
of...
the
length
of
delay
should
never
be
a
basis
alone
to
prove
prejudice
in
his
defense
at
trial?
justice
white
no
presumption
of
prejudice
at
trial
based
on
delay?
justice
white
well,
the
government
has
to
do
this
an
awful
lot
of
times
in
various
situations.
justice
white
well,
you're
asking
him
to
prove
prejudice
from
tapes
that
are
absent
from
existence
at
this
point.
we
may
hear
of
one.
justice
white
i
doubt
you'd
be
here
in
this
argument
if
you
had
taken
the
indictment
and
you
knew
exactly
where
the
fellow
was
and
you
took
the
indictment
and
served
it
on
him
and
didn't
arrest
him,
and
you
knew
he
knew
about
it
and
yet
you
did
not
do
anything
about
arresting
him
or
trying
to
try
him.
you
wouldn't
he
here,
would
you?
justice
white
so
the
fact
of
his
not
knowing
about
it
is
critical.
justice
white
and
the
tapes
may
not
be
in
existence.
justice
white
what
about
his
argument
on
the
nontrial
argument
that
had
you
not
been
negligent
and
gotten
to
him
earlier,
he
might
have
had
the
advantage
of
some
statutory
mechanisms
that
are
no
longer
available?
justice
white
yeah,
but
he
says...
he
says
that
if
you'd
have...
he
was
in
jail.
he
says
if...
that
you
should
have
known
he
was
in
jail,
and
if
you'd
have
gotten
to
him
soon
enough
he
could
have...
he
could
have
triggered
some
mechanisms
that
would
have
brought
him
up
here--
justice
white
--to
stand
trial.
isn't
that
what--
justice
white
--but
you
must
have
known
he
wasn't
about
to
be
in
jail
for
8-1/2
years.
justice
white
eight-and-a-half
years--
justice
white
--well,
the...
when
did...
how
do
you
suppose
the
court
below
decided
that
the
united
states
was
negligent
in...
when
did
the
delay,
and
why
did
it
become
negligent?
justice
white
it
was
after...
after
he
got
back
in
the
united
states
that
they
focused
on
it?
justice
white
mostly
focusing
on
the
period
after
he
arrived
back
in
this
country.
justice
white
and
so
you
saved
your
case
just
by
a
computer.
justice
white
his
name
just
came
up
on
a
computer
somewhere?
justice
white
how
come
you
never
looked
him
up?
justice
white
well,
that's
a...
yeah.
