justice
souter
with
respect
to
the
tapes
and
the
witness,
is
it
correct
that
you
have
no
idea
whether
they
would
have
been
anything
exculpatory
either
in
the
tapes
or
in
the
testimony
of
the
witness?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
mueller,
you
mentioned
on
the
point
of
prejudice
that
he
had
after
all
pleaded
guilty.
did
you
mean
to
suggest
by
that
that
in
any
case
in
which
there
is
a
guilty
plea
there
cannot
be
a
finding
of
prejudice
on
the
assumption
that
prejudice
goes
to
issues
of
guilt
and
innocence
and
the
consequences
of
guilt,
and
since
one
is
pleading
guilty,
by
definition
that
kind
of
prejudice
could
not
be
present,
or
could
not
at
least
be
present
in
some
sufficient
quantity?
justice
souter
are
you
urging
that
on
us
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
1980,
apparently
without
knowing
that
he
had
been
indicted
for
his
role
on
a
drug
conspiracy,
the
petitioner,
mark
doggett,
left
the
united
states
and
traveled
to
panama
where
he
was
soon
jailed
on
other
drug
charges.
federal
officials
asked
panama
to
expel
him
to
this
country
on
completion
of
the
proceedings
against
him
there
and
although
panamanian
officials
agreed
to
comply,
they
failed
to
do
so,
and
in
1982,
they
allowed
doggett
to
leave
for
columbia.
from
that
point
on,
the
government
made
virtually
no
effort
to
track
him
down
and
did
not
know
that
he
returned
to
the
united
states
a
few
months
after
his
departure
from
panama.
some
six
years
later,
the
government
finally
came
across
doggett
after
he
had
married,
earned
a
college
degree,
found
steady
employment,
and
had
lived
openly
under
his
own
name.
doggett
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
that
the
government's
failure
to
prosecute
him
earlier
had
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
district
court
denied
relief.
doggett
entered
a
conditional
guilty
plea
and
the
court
of
appeals
later
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
speedy
trial
claim.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
applying
the
criteria
for
accessing
speedy
trial
claims
that
we
announced
20
years
ago
in
barker
and
wingo,
we
reverse.
the
eight-and-a-half
year
delay
between
doggett's
indictment
and
arrest
clearly
suffices
to
trigger
the
speedy
trial
inquiry
as
the
lower
courts
explicitly
found
the
government
caused
six
years
of
this
delay
by
its
negligent
failure
to
track
doggett
down.
we
accept
the
lower
court's
finding
that
doggett
did
not
know
of
his
outstanding
indictment
and
we
therefore,
do
not
fall
him
for
failing
to
assert
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial
until
after
his
arrest.
we
view
the
extraordinary
length
of
doggett's
pretrial
delay
as
sufficient
to
place
his
ability
to
mount
a
successful
defense
at
trial
in
serious
jeopardy.
we
hold
that
such
presumptive
prejudice
is
sufficient
to
carry
a
speedy
trial
claim
when
the
government
is
at
fault
fro
negligently
causing
a
delay
of
such
extraordinary
length.
justice
o'connor
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
also
written
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
