justice
scalia
but
never
told
him
of
their
visit?
justice
scalia
which
you
can
say
is
as
much
his
mother's
fault
as
it
was
the
government's
fault.
justice
scalia
mr.
sheppard,
you're
not
saying
that
it
was
intentional
on
the
part
of
the
police
here,
but
just
that
they
were
grossly
negligent,
or
negligent
at
least,
in
not
finding
him
sooner.
the
police
make
mistakes.
i
suppose
sometimes
they're
negligent
in
not...
in
not
breaking
a
case
sooner
and
not
finding
out
who
the
guilty
person
is.
justice
scalia
suppose...
suppose
that
you
have
a
5-year
statute
of
limitations
and
because
of
their
negligence
a
crime
that
should
have
been
solved
right
away
and
they
should
have
known
the
criminal
within
weeks
in
fact
is
not
solved
until
4
years
and
10
months,
and
then
it
takes
them
another
3
months
to
locate
the
malefactor,
which
means
you're
over
the
5-year
statute
of
limitations
period,
and
most
of
that,
4
years
10
months,
is
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
police.
is
that
situation
any
different
from
the
situation
your
client
finds
himself
in?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
let's
go
with
the
finding
for
the
time
being.
let's
assume
it
was
just
negligent.
justice
scalia
assuming
it's
negligent,
is
your
situation
any
different
from
the
hypothetical
that
i
just
gave
you?
in
other
words,
if
we
found
for
your
client
here,
wouldn't
we
have
to
find
also
for
the
person
who
claims
that
the
police
negligently
did
not
solve
the
crime
soon
enough?
justice
scalia
mr.
sheppard,
why
should...
why
should
the
criterion
for
whether
the
government
is
responsible
for
this
sad
state
of
affairs
be
whether
they
found
and
arrested
him
in
time?
why...
it's
a
sad
state
of
affairs
only
because
he
does
not
know
of
the
outstanding
indictment.
why
isn't
it
enough
if
the
government
took
reasonable
action
that
would,
in
the
normal
course,
have
advised
him
of
the
existence
of
the
indictment?
why
wouldn't
that
be
enough?
if
that
is
enough,
why
isn't
going
to
his
last
known
address
and
telling
his
mother
that
there
is
an
indictment
outstanding
and
that
the
government
would
like
him
to
appear
to
stand
trial,
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
scalia
but
that
assumes
that
they
have
an
obligation
to
find
and
arrest
this
man.
justice
scalia
for
the
purpose
of
the
interest
that
you're
concerned
about
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
their
only
obligation
is
to
make
sure
that
he
gets
notice
of
the
fact
that
there's
an
indictment
so
that
he
may
come
and
get
the
prompt
trial
to
which
he's
entitled.
and
i
don't
know
why
going
to
the
last
known
address,
telling
his
mother
about
it,
doesn't
fulfill
that
obligation.
thereafter,
maybe
they
were
negligent,
as
good
cops,
in
not
arresting
him
sooner,
and
that's
something
for
which
they're
liable
to
the
rest
of
the
public
for,
but
i
don't
know
why
they're
under
any
special
liability
to
him
for
that.
justice
scalia
normally
when
you
have
an
obligation
to
get
notice
to
somebody,
if
the
obligation
can
be
satisfied
by
publication
in
the
paper
you
publish
it
once.
you
don't
have
to
go
publishing
it
until
the
person
appears,
or
if
it...
if
it...
if
the
notice
can
be
given
by
mail,
you
mail
to
the
last
known
address.
you
don't
have
to
continue
mailing
and
mailing
until
the
person
shows
up.
i
mean,
if
the
problem
here
is
that
this
person
didn't
have
the
notice
so
that
he
could
take
advantage
of
his...
of
his
right
to
enjoy...
a
strange
word,
to
enjoy...
a
speedy
trial,
if
that's
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me
we
should
simply
ask,
did
the
government
take
reasonable
steps
to
get
notice
to
him,
and
if
they
did
that,
if
they
did
it
only
once
that
ought
to
be
good
enough.
justice
scalia
no
fair
using
other
cases.
[laughter]
i'm
sure
that
somewhere
in
the
government
somebody
knew
it,
but
the
people
who
were
responsible
for
arresting
him
maybe
didn't.
justice
scalia
and
when...
when
it's
the
government's
fault.
i
mean,
if
he's
on
the
lam
for
5
years,
hiding
from
the
government--
justice
scalia
--it's
rather
important.
justice
scalia
but
you...
you
don't
assert
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case?
you're
saying,
factor
1,
there
is
nothing
at
all,
so
we
then--
justice
scalia
--we
then
move
on
the
other
factors?
justice
scalia
each
factor
is
worth
25
percent,
or
how
does
this
work?
justice
scalia
you
need
all
four
present,
or
two
out
of
four?
justice
scalia
is
there
any...
is
there
any
way
we
go
about
this
at
all?
justice
scalia
although
it's
fact
bound,
factor
1
is
a
crucial
factor.
if
none
of
the
interests
that,
as
you
say,
the...
the
speedy
trial
guarantee
is
intended
to
serve
is
affected,
end
of
the
case.
but
you
don't
want
to
say
that.
justice
scalia
you
want
to
go
on
and
consider
the
other
three
factors
to
some
extent
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
what
made
it
the
factor
in
that
case?
i
mean,
why
does
that...
what
makes
it
the
central
factor
in
a
particular
case?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
almost
a
waiver
theory.
that...
i'm
not
sure
that
has
much
to
do
whether
he
asserted
the
right
or
not.
justice
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
the
lower
court
found
that
the
government
was
negligent
in
failing
to
arrest
or
apprehend
the
individual,
not
necessarily
that
the
government
was
negligent
in
failing
to
do
what
was
reasonable
to
get
notice
to
the
individual
of
the
pendency
of
the
suit,
and
the
two
are
quite
different
things.
and
if
it's
the
latter
rather
than
the
former
that
triggers
a
speedy
trial
obligation,
the
finding
of
the
court
below
doesn't
necessarily
govern.
doesn't
the
finding
of
the
court
below
just
go
to
negligence
in
failing
to
apprehend
the
individual,
or
does
it
go
to
negligence
in
failing
to
do
what
was
reasonable
to
bring
the
pendency
of
the
indictment
to
his
attention?
justice
scalia
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
idea,
though,
if
we
listened
to
mr.
sheppard,
wouldn't
it?
