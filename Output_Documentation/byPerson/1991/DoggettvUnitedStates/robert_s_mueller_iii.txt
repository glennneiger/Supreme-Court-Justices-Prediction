mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
traditionally
has
looked
at
the
four-pronged
test
of
barker
v.
wingo
in
resolving
issues
relating
to
the
deprivation
or
alleged
deprivation
of
a
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
violation.
those
four
factors
identified
in
barker
are
the
length
of
the
delay,
the
cause
of
the
delay,
the
defendant's
assertion
of
their
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
and
prejudice.
and
we
submit
that
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
magistrate
before
entered
into
the
appropriate
balancing
test
set
out
in
barker
to
determine
that
there
was
no
violation
of
mr.
doggett's
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i
am
not
in
complete
agreement--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--with
my
counsel's
analysis.
there
are
a
number
of
areas
in
which
i
think
we
part
company,
which
i
would
hope
to
explore.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
there
are
areas
in
which
we
disagree
with
the
analysis--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
turning
to
the
first
factor,
and
that
is
the
length
of
delay,
the
court
traditionally
looks
at
this
factor
as
a
triggering
mechanism,
and
indeed
below
we
indicated
that
the
length
of
delay
in
this
case
is
a
triggering
mechanism.
but
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
this
case
is
somewhat
unique,
in
as
much
as
those
core
concerns
of
the
sixth
amendment
were
not
implicated
for
the
period
between
the
time
of
the
indictment
in
1980
and
the
time
of
the
arrest
in
1988.
those
core
concerns
being
the
fact
that
mr.
doggett
suffered
no
restraints
on
his
liberty,
he
was
not
incarcerated,
he
suffered
no
anxiety,
no
humiliation.
he
knew
not,
allegedly,
of
the
indictment,
and
the
pending
indictment
had
no
effect
on
his
life
until
the
time
that
he
was
arrested.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
only
to
the
extent
that
they
play
in
the
evaluation
of
the
four
factors
that
i've
identified
and
that
were
identified
in
barker
v.
wingo.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i
do
not
believe
that
particular
concern
is
articulated
in
the
constitution.
i
do
not--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--believe
that
the
constitution--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i
do
not,
except
the...
on
the
fourth
prong,
where
one
looks
at
prejudice.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
the
statute
had
not
run
because
it
was
tolled
at
the
time
of
his
indictment
in
1980.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
the
filing
of
the
indictment
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
that
is
so,
and
the
concerns
articulated
are
those
articulated
by
this
court
in
previous
cases
as
supporting
or
giving
body...
giving
body
to
that
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
you
move
on
to
factor--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--no,
it
depends
on--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--no--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--unfortunately,
and
i
understand
from
the
dialogue
with
counsel
in
cases
such
as
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
deprivation
of
the
speedy
trial
right,
it
is
fact
bound,
because
in
order
to
give
substance
to
that
particular
right
one
has
to
look
at
the
facts
of
a
particular
case
and
where
it
is
on
the
continuum.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
we
are--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--in
this
particular
case
i
think
the
court
has
not
addressed
the
circumstance
where
a
defendant
does
not
know
about
an
indictment
and
whether
or
not
that
defendant
is
accused
when
he
has
not
suffered
the
humiliation
or
public
scorn
which
comes
from
a
knowing
indictment.
one
could
push
that
the
court
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
does
not
come
into
play
until
such
time
as
that
person
is
actually
brought
into
court
to
face
the
charges.
however,
we're
not--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--asking
the
court
to
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i'm
sorry,
government
delay
and--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--in
and
of
itself--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i
don't
believe
so.
not
alone.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
the
defendant's
assertion
of
the
right,
and
prejudice.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
if
the
defendant--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
prejudice
in
every
case,
but
this
court
has
found
in
moore
v.
arizona
that
you
can
have
cases...
there
are
those
cases,
as
was
the
case
in
moore
v.
arizona,
where
the
defendant
can
successfully
have
the
case
dismissed
under
the
sixth
amendment
right
as
a
result
of
the
court
finding
that
the
other
three
factors
weighed
heavily
against
the
government...
the
length
of
delay,
the
reason
for
the
delay,
and
the
defendant's
assertion,
and
the
defendant
did
not
have
to...
would
not
have
to,
in
that
context,
prove
prejudice.
so
the
court--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--if
you
follow
moore,
yes,
that
is...
that
is
possible.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
yes.
we're
asking
for
the
court
to
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
and
not
attempting
to
drive
the
sixth
circuit
law
past
where
it
has
been
placed
principally
by
barker
v.
wingo,
which
is
guidance
to
each
court
who
looks
at
a
problem
similar
to
this.
as
to
those
factors
that
are
critically
important,
it
is
not...
they
are
not
the
only
factors
the
court
must
look
to,
but
in
order
to
give
body,
substance
to
that
sixth
amendment
right,
one
has
to
identify,
those...
that
particular
factor
which
plays
a
prominent
role
in
that
particular
case.
in
barker
v.
wingo,
as
an
example,
the
defendant's
failure
to
assert
his
right
in
that
particular
case
was
critical,
even
though
he'd
spent
time
incarcerated,
even
though
the
government
had
sought
the
delay
in
order
to
enable
it
to
better
its
case
by
having
a
co-defendant
testify,
and
that
particular
factor
in
that
case
was
the
prominent
factor.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
in
that...
on
that
particular
case
it
appeared
from
the
opinion
that
the
defendant
wanted
it
both
ways.
he
was
claiming
a
violation
of
a
sixth
amendment
right,
but
it
was
clear
from
the
record
in
that
case
that
he
had
concurred
in
a
substantial
portion
of
the
delay
in
order
to
better
his
position,
so
the
court
found...
i
think
it
can
be
read
from
the
opinion...
that
the
defendant
did
not
effectively
carry
the
burden
of
asserting
his
right.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
the
court--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--that's
correct.
we
would...
we
would
say
that.
one
has
to
look
at
what
exactly
occurred
during
that
delay.
what
was
the
reason
for
the
delay?
and
that
is--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--it
should
not
follow
at
all.
and
i
would...
i
do
part
company
with
counsel
in
terms
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
showing
prejudice.
and
who
should
bear
the
burden
of
showing
prejudice?
the
government
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
in
proving
a
negative.
how
does
the
government
prove
an
absence
of
prejudice
when
the
defendant
is
the
one
who
is
in
control
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
understands
what
his
or
her
defense
might
be.
what
counsel
is
asking
the
court
to
do--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--not
in
the
area
of...
not
in
the...
i'm
unaware
of
an
occasion
where
the
burden
has
been
placed
on
the
government
to
prove
an
absence
of
prejudice.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
that's
correct.
the
defendant
was
a
participant
on
those
tapes.
if
the
defendant
has
some
reason
to
believe--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--no.
he
was
not
a
participant.
he
was
a
participant
on
some,
but
he
would
know
what
was
said
in
the
course
of
those
conversations,
and
should
be
able
to
articulate
if
there
is
something
exculpatory
in
the
course
of
those
conversations.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
no.
i'm
arguing
that--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i
have
a
hard...
i
have
a
difficult
time
in
saying
a
case
is
stronger
or
weaker
without
looking
at
the
particular
factors
in
the
barker
v.
wingo
analysis.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
that
is,
and
it
goes
to
the
point,
i
believe,
of
whether
or
not
the
government
in
this
case
was
in
fact
negligent.
and
one
of
the
areas
in
which
we
would
take
exception
with
a
court
of
appeals
that
the
government
was
negligent.
we
feel
that--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
upset
that.
the
point
i
do
want
to
make
is
that
in
evaluating
what
the
responsibility
or
burden
of
the
government
is
in
order
to
apprehend
fugitives,
one
should
look
not
only
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
what
standard
should
be
applied.
and
the
standard
that
i
would
suggest
should
be
applied
is
one
of
reasonableness.
and
if
an
indictment
issues
the
government
does,
we
will
concede,
have
a
responsibility
to
do...
to
take
certain
steps
to
bring
that
individual
before
the
bar
of
justice.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
government
knows
where
that
individual
is
located
there
is
a
responsibility
to
go
and
find
that
individual
at
that
place.
if
the
government
knows
where
family
is
located,
the
government
probably
reasonably
has
a
responsibility
to
go
to
that
place
and
locate
the
person.
and
finally,
if
the
government
believes
that--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--and
i
was
going
to
say
that
in
this
particular
case
we
did
what
was
reasonable.
agents
went
to
the
house--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--and
talked
to
the
mother--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--well,
i
would...
i
would...
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
overturn
the--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i
don't
think
that
the
case
rises
or
falls
on
whether
or
not
the
eleventh
circuit
is
correct
in
its
characterization
of
the
facts
of
this
case
as
negligence.
and
when
this
court
has
addressed
factual
situations
like
this
in
the
past...
in
barker
v.
wingo
it
looked
at
the
facts
and
not
necessarily
at
the
conclusions
based
on
those
facts.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
no,
it
does
address
and
focus
on
the
failure
to
arrest
him
and
does
not
address
the
failure
to
give
him
notice.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
well,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
well,
that's
what...
i
think
mr.
sheppard
and
his
clients...
that
mr.
sheppard
and
his
clients
would
certainly
support
that
idea
wholeheartedly.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
we
would
not
be
here.
we...
we'd
stand
with
the
position
that--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--in
this
particular
case,
it
makes
it
unique,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i
think
what
one
looks
to
is
whether
or
not
the
delay
resulted
in
excessive
prejudice
in
some
fashion,
prejudice
in
addition
to
that
prejudice
which
would
have
come
from
his
having
been
arrested
and
prosecuted
in
1980.
in
1980,
he
presumably
not
only
would
have
been
arrested
and
prosecuted
but
quite
probably,
as
mr.
sheppard
has
indicated,
would
have
spent
substantial
time
in
incarceration.
so
there
was
no
additional
prejudice
attributable
to
the
delay
in
this
case.
yes,
his
life
was
disputed.
it
would
have
been
disrupted
in
1980.
now,
turning
back
to
the
factor
of
prejudice,
and
in
particular
the
prejudice
articulated
by...
or
alleged
prejudice
articulated
by
counsel
with
regard
to
the
tapes.
as
i've
indicated,
those
tapes...
on
the
one
hand
there
was
no
allegation
or
assertion
by
defendant
below
that
there
was
anything
specifically
exculpatory
on
those
tapes.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
confidential
informant
there
was
and
is
an
indication
in
the
record
that
had
this
case
gone
to
trial
then
he
would
have
been
available,
and
thirdly,
the
defendant
did
plead
guilty
in
this
case,
and
has
acknowledged
his
guilt.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i
would
say
that
over
a
period
of
time,
yes,
it
might
be
more
difficult
to
remember
what
happened
in
any
particular
instance.
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
the
tapes
may
not
be
in
existence
at
that
point
in
time,
or
at
the
point
in
time
when
it
was
going
to
go
to
trial.
that
is
true.
but
there
has
to
be
an
affirmative
showing
that
there
is
something
exculpatory,
something
that
would
adversely
affect
his
ability
to
obtain
a
fair
trial,
and
that
showing
was
not
made
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
the
eleventh
circuit
disposed
of
his
argument
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
by...
to
take
advantage
of
the
youth
offender
act
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
voluntarily
absented
himself
from
the
country
until
such
time
as
he
was
22
and
was
not
thereby...
at
that
late
age
that
act
was
not
available
to
him.
so
the
eleventh
circuit
in
our
opinion--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--well,
the--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--again,
what
we
had
done
is
what
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
again,
if
you're
going
to
the
notice
issue
as
opposed
to
the
objective
of
arresting
him,
we
had
satisfied
whatever
obligation
there
is
by
going
to
his
house
and
telling
his
mother
that
there
was
an
outstanding
indictment
against
him.
and
going
to
the
time
that
he
was
in
panama,
if
you
look
at
what
agent
driver,
the
agent
on
the
case,
understood
at
that
time,
he
understood
that
when
mr.
doggett
would
be...
were
released
from
incarceration
in
panama,
the
attorney
general
of
panama
would
expel
him
to
the
united
states.
and
so
the
agent
who
was
in
charge
of
that
case
accomplished
what
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
given
what
he
understood
the
case
to
be.
and
the
constitution
does
not
put,
in
our
minds,
a
further
burden
on
the
government
either
with
regard
to
notification
or
with
regard
to
a
duty
to--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--well,
it
was
the
assumption
of
the
agent
at
that
time
that--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--that
he
was
going
to
be
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
based
on
his
experience
with
those
who
are
incarcerated
in
panama
as
a
result
of
drug
trafficking.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
well,
it...
if
one
looks
at
the--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--the
characterization
of
negligence
i
think
flows
from
counsel's
deft
argument
that
there
were
things
the
government
could
have
done
and
should
have
done
as
opposed
to
looking
at
what
was
done
and
the
reason
why
it
was
done
in
this
circumstance.
the
magistrate--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--that's
correct,
but
if
you
look
at...
if
you
look
at
the
particular
segments
of
time.
the
time
he
was
in
panama,
the
agents
legitimately
believed
that
once
he
was
believed
from
the
panamanian
jail
he
would
be
expelled
back
to
the
united
states.
they
had
the
assurances
of
the
panamanian
attorney
general.
thereafter,
when
the
agent
went
down
in
1985,
he
found,
still
there,
papers
of
mr.
doggett,
and
they
indicated
that
he
had
a
colombian
address
and
that
he
was
using
his
mother's
colombian
surname
as
his
alias,
and
accordingly
the
agent
at
that
time
believed
that
mr.
doggett
would
be
in
colombia.
also--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--it's
not
a
question
of
saving
the
case,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--no.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
well,
he
was...
in
1988
he
was
still
in
ncic
as
a
fugitive
and
there
was
a
marshals'
sweep,
as
one
would
call
it--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--and
they
did
find
him
at
that
time,
yes,
but
he
came
back
into
the
united
states
without
having
gone
through...
without
having
been
picked
up
when
he
came
back
in
1982.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
there
is
some
case
law
to
support
that.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
addressed
that
particular
issue.
what
we
do
say--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--i
do
not
think
the
court
has
to
reach
that
in
this
particular...
reach
that
issue
in
this
particular
case.
however,
when
one
talks
about
prejudice,
actual
prejudice
to
a
defendant's
case,
that
prejudice
to
be
serious
and
to
be...
given
a
great
deal
of
weight
should
bear
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
that
individual.
and
by
pleading
guilty
in
any
circumstance
like
this...
and
i'd
go
to
the
circumstances
that
were
the
subject
of
the
plea.
not
the
40
kilos
that
was
brought
out,
but
the
circumstance
of
the
plea,
which
was
a
hand-to-hand
distribution
of
cocaine
and
money.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
that...
under
rule
11,
it
was.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
no.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i
do
not
believe
that's
the
case,
because
one
can
urge--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--well,
it
may
cut
you
off
as
to
certain
allegations
of
prejudice
with
regard
to
your
guilt
or
the
proof
of
your
guilt
or
innocence
on
particular
elements
of
the
case.
it
does
not
preclude
you
from
alleging...
asserting
prejudice
from
the
delay
other
than
that
which
would
bear
directly
upon
your
guilt
or
innocence.
and
it
would
make
a
difference
as
to
how
the
court
looked
to
that.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
back
and
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case
and
weighing
what
the
government
did,
which
we
believe
to
be
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
against
the
absence
or
lack
of
prejudice.
and
one
has
the
impression
that
there
as
no
injustice
done
in
this
particular
case,
and
indeed
the
length
of
time
inured
to
mr.
doggett's
defense
in
that...
or,
to
his
benefit
in
that
i
think
it
quite
probable
that,
had
he
been
arrested
earlier,
he
would
have
spent
a
substantial
period
of
time
incarcerated.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
i
am
not
certain
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
well,
i
think
that
is
not
one
of
the
factors
that
one
looks
at.
i'm
just
saying
that
the
assertion
of
prejudice
from
the
delay--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--yes.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
yes.
there
is
dicta
in
cases
which
say
that
under
similar
circumstances
the
delay
can
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
in
a
number
of
ways,
one
of
which
is
it
allows
the
defendant
to
show
to
the
court
that
he
or
she
has
resumed
a
normal
lifestyle
and
is
an
honest
citizen.
so
in--
mr.
robert
s.
mueller,
iii
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
ask
that
you
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case.
