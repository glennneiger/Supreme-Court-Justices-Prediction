we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
90-1038,
cipollone
v.
the
liggett
group.
mr.
edell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
language
congress
used
is...
certainly
can
be
construed
more
broadly
than
you're
suggesting.
don't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
that
the
provision
of
section
(b)
could
be
read
to
preclude
the
sort
of
failure
to
warn
claims
in
state
tort
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
think
the
third
circuit
is
simply
irrational,
i
suppose,
if
you
don't
think
it
can
even
reasonably
be
read
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
edell,
certainly
in
some
of
the
debates
over
so-called
tort
reform,
one
of
the
arguments
used
by
people
who
are
against
capping
damages
and
that
sort
of
thing,
is
that
these
kind
of
suits
are
the
best
way
to
regulate
an
industry
and
to
keep
its
products
safe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
still
not
regulating?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
mr.
edell,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
edell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1038,
cipollone
against
the
liggett
group,
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
