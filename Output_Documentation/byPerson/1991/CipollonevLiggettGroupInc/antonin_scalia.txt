justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
suppose
you
have
a
regulation
that
has
as
the
sanction
for
its
violation
only
the
payment
of
money.
why
isn't
that
precisely
the
same
as
a
tort
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
he
does.
he
can
violate
it
and
pay
the
money,
just
as
with
the
tort
action.
you
violate
the
law,
the
tort
law,
and
pay
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
a
lawbreaker
when
you
intentionally
violate
someone's
rights
under
the
common
law
of
torts?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
so
even
if
the
governmental
sanction
is
not
called
a
criminal
sanction,
but
it
is
just
a
civil
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
punitive
damages?
suppose
the
jury
not
only
finds
the
cigarette
manufacturer
misrepresented
contrary
to
common
law
and
imposes
compensatory
damages,
but
even
imposes
punitive
damages.
does
that
change
your
answer
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean,
you'd
say
punitive
damages
are
also
allowed
because
they
do
not
impose,
or
are
not
based,
upon
any
requirement
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it?
what
does
it
have
to
be
to
be
a
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
depends
on
whether
it's
created
by
the
courts
or
by
a
legislative
or
executive
agency.
is
that
the
distinction
you're
drawing?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
know
that,
but
about
a
court?
suppose
a
court...
suppose
a
state
supreme
court
gets
specific
enough
that
it
says
in
one
of
its
decisions,
under
the
common
law
of
our
state
a
manufacturer
is
liable
unless
the
manufacturer
says
on
the
cigarette
package,
in
these
words,
beware,
cigarettes
may
cause
cancer,
emphysema,
and
death.
and
the
state
supreme
court
says
that's
the
common
law
in
our
state.
does
that
violate...
is
that
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it
does
it
through
a
court
decision
and
not
an
executive
or
legislative.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
his
state,
mr.
edell.
he
has
a
state
supreme
court
that
says
we're
going
to
issue
these
injunctions.
[laughter]
there
are
a
lot
of
areas
of
the
law
where
they
do
that.
i
don't
know
about
new
jersey
and
cigarette
cases,
but
it's
not
unusual
to
grant
equitable
relief
in
addition
to
damages.
do
you
think
that
would
be
preemptive?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it's
also,
as
some
of
the
earlier
questioning
suggested
it,
i
mean
what
we're
grappling
with
is,
it
also
seems
a
little
absurd
to
think
that
congress
said,
you
can't
do
this,
unless
of
course,
you
do
it
through
the
courts.
if
you
do
it
through
the
courts,
you
know,
you
can
completely
frustrate
our
handiwork.
so
long
as
that
requirement,
you
know,
beware
cigarettes
may
cause...
cigarettes
cause
cancer,
emphysema,
and
possibly
death...
so
long
as
it's
some
judge
who
says
that
that
has
to
be
there,
it's
okay.
could
congress
possibly
have
meant
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
farr,
what
if
a
cigarette
manufacturer
voluntarily
puts
on
the
package,
cigarettes
may
be
bad
for
your
health
in
some
respects,
but
scientific
evidence
shows
that
they
are
good
in
other
respects.
they
fight
bronchial
asthma
germs
or
something
like
that.
and
there's
no
evidence
for
this,
this
is
purely
fanciful.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
didn't...
if
the
ftc
chose
not
to
move,
there
could
be
no
tort
remedy
under
general
misrepresentation,
fraud,
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
entire
field
of
fraud,
deceit?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
there
are
two
limitations
in
this
text,
and
we
were
speaking
with
mr.
edell
mostly
about
the
limitation
requirement
or
prohibition,
what
constitutes
a
requirement
of
prohibition.
but
it
also
says
based
on
smoking
and
health.
and
maybe
what
congress
meant
by
that
is
that
the
prohibition
has
to
be
one
that
is
rather
narrowly
focused.
and
a
general
fraud
or
deceit
prohibition
is
not
a
prohibition
based
on
smoking
and
health.
you're
not
allowed
to
lie.
we
don't
care
whether
you
do
it
about
the
benefits
of...
the
health
benefits
of
cigarette
or
anything
else,
you're
just
not
allowed
to
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
argument.
and
it's
based
on
the
essentially
inane
consequences
that
ensue
if
you
say
the
states
can
do
through
court
decisions
what
they
couldn't
do
through
regulations.
what
you're
saying
is
that's
sort
of
an
absurd
way
to
read
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
you
have,
you
know,
the
smokeless
tobacco
act,
which
clearly
produces
exactly
such
an
absurd
result,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
it's
not
such
an
absurd
result.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
farr,
is
there
a
remedy
in
your
scheme
for
at
least
this...
the
cigarette
company
publishes
the
warning
required
by
federal
law,
but
then
has
under
it,
the
surgeon
general's
report
is
full
of
baloney.
[laughter]
it
says
that.
you
know,
this
report
is
not
worth
the
paper
it's
written
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
remedy.
the
ftc
will
take
care
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
truthful,
if
it
just
says,
you
know,
not
everyone
agrees
with
the
surgeon
general's
report.
how
can
the
ftc
come
down
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
says,
you
know,
many
experts
disagree
with
the
surgeon
general's
report.
can
that
be
on
the
cigarette
under
the
government
warning?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
unless
it's
deceptive,
the
ftc
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
edell,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
satisfactory
to
say
a
requirement
is
not
being
imposed
so
long
as
you
do
not
have
to
do
any
single
thing,
but
you
must
do
1
of
10
things.
i
still
consider
that
a
requirement,
don't
you?
it
isn't
enough
to
say,
well,
they
wouldn't
have
to
do
it
this
way,
they
could
do
it
a
lot
of
other
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
you
must
do
it
1
of
100
ways
is
still
to
impose
a
requirement,
isn't
it?
