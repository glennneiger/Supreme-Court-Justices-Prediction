justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
related
question?
part
of
the
basis
for
the
liability,
i
think,
was
on
fraudulent
misrepresentation
in
advertising.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
1334(b)
says
no
requirement
or
prohibition
based
on
smoking
and
health
shall
be
imposed
under
state
law
with
respect
to
the
advertising.
now,
a
tort
suit
based
on
fraudulent
misrepresentation
in
advertising
does
appear
to
seek
to
impose
a
state
law
prohibition
within
the
meaning
of
that
subsection.
what
option
does
the
manufacturer
have
other
than
to
cease
using
the
advertising?
and
how
is
that
not
covered
by
(b)
in
the
literal
language?
i
know
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
ca-3
decided,
but
i
just
wonder,
in
the
context
of
the
fraudulent
misrepresentation,
how
it
is
not
covered
by
(b).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
edell,
in
the
same
general
area,
i
suppose
the
award
of
compensation
in
a
tort
suit
is
based
on
finding
some
preexisting
duty
by
the
tort
feasor...
a
duty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
isn't
a
duty
determined
by
state
law
somehow
regulatory?
has
this
court
ever
thought
that
it
could
be,
for
instance
in
the
garman
case
or
other
cases?
have
we
ever
looked
at
tort
liability
and
said
yes,
that
can
be
a
form
of
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
that's
true.
but
of
course
in
silkwood,
it
appears
at
least
that
we
referred
to
an
affirmative
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
preserve
state
tort
remedies.
and
i'm
not
sure
here
we
see
what
congress
intended,
other
than
by
the
language
that
it
used.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farr,
do
you
think
that
your
theory
means
that
congress
intended
to
set
a
ceiling
on
the
amount
of
information
that
consumers
would
receive
from
the
manufacturers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
lower
limit
of
a
requirement
so
that
additional
warnings
are
appropriate
perhaps?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
minimum?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
they
prohibited
from
adding
additional
warnings
on
their
packages,
in
your
view,
by
that
language?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
can
get
to
both.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
without
regard
to
state
law,
is
the
manufacturer
under
the
terms
of
the
act
free
to
add
additional
warnings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
then
do
you
think
that
it's
open
to
a
state,
through
its
tort
law,
to
establish
a
duty
to
provide
additional
warnings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
a
presumption,
i
guess,
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
disrupt
state
tort
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
smokeless
tobacco
act,
congress
was
pretty
clear
in
indicating
that
it
thought
state
tort
suits
could
continue.
