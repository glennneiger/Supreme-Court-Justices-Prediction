justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
with
a
result
that
said,
if
you
could
convince
a
judge
or
a
jury
that
the
companies
are
actually
neutralizing
or
negating
their
warnings,
that
you
can
recover?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that's
all
you
can
recover.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
would
you
be
satisfied?
but
i
take
it
you
want
to
go
much
farther
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
not
be
satisfied
at
all
with
just
the
failure
to
conform
to
their
warnings.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
thought
so.
[laughter]
mr.
farr,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
sounds
like
an
argument
of
field
preemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you...
i
take
it
you're
in
a
sense
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
aren't
defending
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
your
field
preemption
field
argument
is
concerned,
i
take
it
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
is
a
so-called
field
preemption
that
you're
arguing
for
and
that
you
have
to
get
around
to
express
conflict
or
frustration,
doesn't
the
'69
act
help
you
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
farr,
suppose
the
state
just
passes
a
law
and
says
no
one
may
bring
into
the
state
any
product
that's
determined
by
a
commission
to
be
dangerous
to
the
public
health.
and
it
is
decided
that
a
whole
list
of
products
including
cigarettes
are
dangerous
to
the
public
health.
and
here
a
cigarette
company
brings
in
some
cigarettes
in
violation,
and
it
is...
and
they
say
well,
this
is...
you're
just
wrong.
we're
not,
this
product
isn't
dangerous
to
public
health.
well,
they
lose
the
case.
do
you
think
that's
preemptive?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
so
that
would
just
be
an
ordinary
tort
suit
that
says,
look,
you've
brought
in
a
dangerous
product
and
you've
hurt
somebody,
and
you're
going
to
have
to
pay.
we
don't
care
what...
we're
not
saying
anything
about
advertising,
warnings
or
anything
else.
here
is
just
a
dangerous
instrumentality.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
kind
of
a
suit
preempted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the
particular
litigation
that's
involved
here
is
in
the
field
of
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
the
causes
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
haven't
quite
got
around
to
explaining
why
congress
would
want
to
occupy
the
field
and
not
ever
have
a
remedy
or
provide
a
remedy
for
injury
caused
by
a
dangerous
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
remedy
before
the
ftc
to
correct
misleading
advertising
and
things
like
that.
but
you're
not
going
to
recover
any
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
fact
perhaps
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
tort
remedy
such
as
this,
you're
going
to
get
in...
to
impose
liability,
you're
going
to
have
to
say
something
about
the
failure
to
warn
or
the
misrepresentation,
or
something
like
that.
you
just
can't
go
into
court
and
say
this
product
is
dangerous.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
may
not
win.
