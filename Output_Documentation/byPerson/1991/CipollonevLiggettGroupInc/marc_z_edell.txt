mr.
marc
z.
edell
thank
you
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
cigarette
labeling
act
preempts
state
common
law
tort
claims
against
cigarette
manufacturers
for
failure
to
warn,
fraud,
deception,
and
misrepresentation.
in
1964,
the
surgeon
general's
advisory
committee
on
smoking
and
health
issued
its
landmark
report.
in
that
report,
it
indicted
cigarette
smoking
as
the
major
cause
of
preventable
death
in
the
united
states.
in
response
to
that
report,
states
and
municipalities
across
the
country
began
proposing
legislation
that
would
require
cigarette
manufacturers
to
place
warning
labels
on
their
packs
of
cigarettes
and
in
their
advertising.
at
the
same
time,
the
federal
trade
commission
began
its
rulemaking
process
which
would
likewise
require
cigarette
manufacturers
to
place
a
specific
warning
on
packs
of
cigarettes
and
in
their
advertising.
in
the
wake
of
all
this
activity,
in
1965,
congress
intervened.
congress
intervened
for
two
reasons.
first,
to
decide
what
steps
it
should
take
on
a
national
basis
in
light
of
the
surgeon
general's
report
and
its
conclusions.
and
second,
to
address
the
cigarette
manufacturers'
concern
that
if
they
were
forced
by
these
various
state
regulations
and
the
federal
trade
commission
to
put
different
warning
labels
on
packages
of
cigarettes
and
in
their
advertising,
they
would
not
be
able
to
conduct
business
on
a
national
basis.
congress
heard
hearings
for
many
weeks.
industry
representatives
testified.
submissions
were
made.
the
industry
again
asked
for
preemption
of
state
regulations
and
of
the
ftc
so
that
they
could
go
ahead
and
do
business.
congress,
in
enacting
the
1965
cigarette
labeling
act
required,
one,
a
specific
warning
on
packs
of
cigarettes;
and
two,
it
gave
the
industry
the
preemption
it
asked
for,
not
preemption
of
state
common
law
tort
claims...
claims
that
the
industry
had
already
been
faced
with
for
over
a
decade
prior
to
the
1965
act.
it
preempted
any
statements
to
be
required
on
packages
of
cigarettes
other
than
the
federally
mandated
statement,
and
it
preempted
any
warning
requirements
in
cigarette
advertising
whatsoever.
in
1969,
congress
intervened
again
on
the
issue
of
preemption.
it
was
not
because
the
cigarette
manufacturers,
now
15
years
into
the
litigation,
decided
that
they
needed
some
protection
from
these
tort
suits.
the
reason
was
that
the
section
1334(b),
that
is
the
preemption
section
applicable
to
warning
labels
in
advertising,
was
to
expire
on
july
1,
1969.
congress
again
held
hearings.
and
again
the
industry
said,
we
need
preemption
of
state
regulations
that
would
require
us
to
put
different
warning
labels
on
packs
of
cigarettes
and
in
our
advertising.
and
again,
congress
gave
them
their
request.
but
congress
decided
in
1969
to
restructure
the
act
somewhat.
it
restructured
it
by
giving
the
federal
trade
commission
freedom
now
to
proceed
with
its
rulemaking
process
to
decide
whether
or
not
warnings
should
be
required
in
cigarette
advertising.
it
restructured
it
also
to
make
clear
that
not
only
were
the
states,
but
also
the
states'
political
subdivisions
were
also
precluded
from
imposing
these
regulations
that
would
require
warning
labels
in
advertising
or
in...
on
packages
of
cigarettes.
in
1969,
congress
also
decided
on
a
new
warning,
and
for
other
reasons
it
removed
cigarette
advertising
from
electronic
media.
at
no
time
during
the
1969
hearings
or
in
the
1965
hearings
did
the
industry
ask
for
protection
for
these
cases.
at
no
time
during
either
of
the
hearings
in
1965
or
'69
is
there
any
suggestion
that
congress,
any
one
congressman...
congressperson...
suggested
that
there
would
be
preemption
of
state
common
law
tort
claims.
all
discussions
regarding
state
common
law
tort
claims
were
based
upon
the
assumption
that
these
cases
were
to
continue.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
don't
agree
with
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
no,
i
don't,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
think
that
the
natural
read
of
section
1334(b)
does
not
suggest
that
these
cases...
that
these
cases
are
encompassed
in
that
preemption.
and
in
fact,
the
third
circuit
did
not
read
1334(b)
as
specifically
including
these
cases.
the
third
circuit
said
that
on
the
issue
of
expressed
preemption,
1334(b)
did
not
state
that
these
cases
were
preempted.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
as
it
stands
today
under
the
third
circuit's
ruling?
mr.
marc
z.
edell
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--i
don't
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
statute
but
for
the
third
circuit's
opinion--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--okay.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
no.
i
think
that
the
manufacturer
is
entitled
to
the
instruction
that
the
jury,
in
considering
whether
or
not
the
manufacturer
met
its
standard
of
care
that's
required
under
common
law,
placed
a
warning
required
by
the
federal
government
on
its
packs
of
cigarettes
and
in
its
cigarette
advertising.
but
until
the
third
circuit
opinion,
it
has
historically
been
in
the
area
of
tort
law
that
if
a
manufacturer,
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter,
follows
a
regulation,
that
that
regulation
sets
the
floor
and
not
the
ceiling
for
manufacturers'
behavior.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
to
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question,
justice--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--it
is.
it
is,
but
with
respect
to
tort
law,
juries
don't
decide
what
further
language
should
be
placed
on
packages
of
cigarettes
or
in
cigarette
advertising
at
any
time.
for
example,
in
this
case
let's
assume
the
jury
heard
all
of
the
evidence.
it
saw
the
federally
mandated
warning.
it
saw
the
warning
in
the
advertisement.
it
saw
the
advertising.
it
saw
all
of
the
internal
documents
that
we've
developed
during
the
course
of
discovery,
some
of
which
are
a
part
of
our
appendix.
and
where
the
industry
attempted
to
neutralize
the
effect
of
the
federally
mandated
warning.
the
only
question
that
the
jury
would
then
answer
would
be,
question,
did
cigarette
manufacturer
x
adequately
inform
its
consumers
of
the
health
hazards
of
cigarette
smoking?
yes
or
no.
and
if
they
answered
no,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
warning
itself
is
not
adequate.
it
could
very
well
be
that
but
for
the
intentional
acts
to
neutralize
that
warning
that
the
warning
by
itself
is
adequate.
and
this
is
not
an
alien
concept.
this
is
a
concept
that--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--i
don't
see
how
that
fits
in
the
context
of
a
tort
action.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
well,
it's...
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
it's
relevant
on
the
issue
of...
the
issue
that
the
jury
is
to
decide.
the
issue
to
be
decided
is
whether
or
not
they
adequately
informed
their
consumers.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
justices
o'connor,
i
think
that
is
probably
one
of
the
more
difficult
issues
in
this
case.
not
necessarily
only
on
fraudulent
misrepresentation,
because
the
question
that's
posed
to
the
jury
on
that
issue
is,
did
cigarette
manufacturer
x
fraudulently
misrepresent
to
its
consumers
the
health
hazards
of
cigarette
smoking.
and
when
the
jury
considers
that
issue,
they
will
consider
not
only
the
advertising,
they
will
consider
the
public
relations
communications.
they
will
consider
all
of
the
activities
of
the
industry,
the
suppression
of
test
results.
so
a
yes
answer
to
that
question
does
not
necessarily,
even
if
the
manufacturer
wanted
to
do
something,
does
not
necessarily
require
them
from
no
longer
using
the
particular
advertising.
because
we
don't
know
from
the
jury
verdict
whether
or
not
it
was
the...
a
particular
advertisement
that
convinced
the
jury
that
there
was
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
i
think
the
harder
issue,
and
i
will
admit
it,
is
the
express
warranty
issue,
where
you
have
a
particular
advertisement,
and
a
jury
says
this
particular
advertisement
is
a
breach
of
warranty.
the
cigarette
manufacturer
has
the
choice
of,
one,
paying
the
judgment,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
and
merrily
proceeding
to
employ
the
same
express
warranty...
and
that's
a
business
decision
that
they
make.
and
that
is
the
difference
between
requirements,
if
you
will,
and
tort
actions.
it
leaves
the
discretion
on
the
manufacturer
as
to
how
to
proceed.
but
yes,
at
some
juncture
with
$
500,
000,
000,
000
billion
worth
of--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--because
a
regulation
gives
the
manufacturer
no
discretion
of
what
their
activities
are.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
but
then
you
are
a
lawbreaker.
i
mean--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--you're
not
violating
a
law,
you're
violating
a
standard,
if
you
will,
justice
scalia,
a
standard
of
how
we
interact
between
ourselves
as
citizens.
it
is
a
moral...
a
standard
of
morality
that
we
impose
upon
ourselves.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
difference
is
the
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
it
would
give
the
manufacturer
greater
incentive
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
a
reasonable
fashion,
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
they're
not
regulations,
and
this
act
is
directed
to
regulations.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
it
has
to
be
an
ordinance.
it
has
to
be
a
statute.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--i
would
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
act,
if
the
executive
branch
was
empowered
to
enact
a
particular
proclamation
that
would
require
a
cigarette
manufacturer
to
do
something
violative
of
this
act--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--i
don't
think
that
that
was
what
congress
was
trying
to
prevent.
i
think
congress
was
well
aware
of
these
tort
actions.
i
think
they
were
willing
to
accept
any
tension
that
might
exist
between
compensating
the
individual
who
is
injured
as
a
result
of
that
tortious
conduct.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
state
can
impose
absolute
liability
on
a
cigarette
manufacturer.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
no,
but--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--if
there
was
a
tort
action,
if
there
was
a...
for
example,
a
nuisance
action,
that
would
require
a
manufacturer
to
specifically
place
a
particular
warning
in
an
advertisement,
and
if
they
failed
to
do
that,
then
an
injunction
would
issue.
i
would
think
that
that
would
come
close
to
a
conflict
and
that
the
act
would
not...
the
intent
of
the
act
would
not
tolerate
it.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
but
that's
not
how...
our
court
system
doesn't
permit
that.
the
concept
of
the--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--there's
no
tort
system,
product
liability
tort
system
that
i
know
of
in
this
united
states
that
grants
equitable
relief
like
that,
that
would
actually
regulate
the
behavior
directly
of
the
manufacturer.
all
that
the
jury
does
is
say,
under
the
circumstances,
they
failed
to
meet
the
responsibility
the
consequences
of
which
are
you
must
pay.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
think
that
if
equitable
relief
could
be...
would
include
an
injunction,
i
think
that
that
comes
very
close
to
an
actual
conflict.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
yes.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
yes,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
court
said
in
garman
was
that
it
could
have
a
regulatory
effect.
and
given
the
broad
nature
of
the
preemption
in
garman,
it
is
a
conflict.
it's
not
an
expressed
preemption,
but
it's
a
conflict.
but
i
think
if
we
look
at
some
of
the
more
recent
jurisprudence
from
this
court.
if
we
look
at
silkwood,
if
we
look
at
english,
if
we
look
at
goodyear,
if
think
that
we
see
the
court
saying,
indirect
regulatory
effect
is
something
much,
much
different
than
direct
regulatory
effect
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
well,
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
we
don't
see
a
whisper,
justice
o'connor,
of
an
intent
to
preempt.
and
we
start
out
with
the
assumption
that
state
common
law
tort
claims
are
to
continue.
that's
our
presumption
that
we
walk
into
this
court
with.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
act
also.
this
court,
for
example,
in
ingersoll,
said
let's
look
for
some
special
feature
here
that
will
help
us
distinguish
whether
or
not
this
is
a
matter
that
should
be
preempted.
and
the
special
feature
this
court
found
so
persuasive
there
was
the
alternative
remedial
scheme.
we
look
at
this
act
and
we
say
to
ourselves,
there's
no
remedial
scheme
whatsoever.
congress
did
away
with
100
years
of
development
of
common
law,
provided
no
remedial
scheme.
not
a
whisper
of
it
is
contained
in
the
legislative
history,
not
in
any
committee
reports.
and
we
walk
into
this
court
with
a
presumption
against
preemption
and
we're
supposed
to
assume
that
that's
the
way
congress
did
it?
it
doesn't
coincide
with
the
way
things
work.
and
i
think
it's
an
absurd
suggestion.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
yes,
justice
scalia.
i
think
we
see
evidence
of
it.
and
i
don't
like
to
compare
one
act
to
another,
but
just
the
concept
of
the
absurdity
of
the
thought,
we
see
evidence
of
it
in
the
smokeless
tobacco
act.
there
the
congress
said,
this
is
the
specific
warning
that
should
be
put
on
packs
of
smokeless
tobacco.
and
yet
it
provided
at
the
very
same
time,
in
light
of
all
of
the
preemption
decisions,
a
savings
clause
saying,
it's
okay,
we
say
this
is
the
warning,
but
you
can
continue
to
sue.
that's
a
specific
example
that
i
could
give
you.
now,
i
guess,
you
know,
in
the
end
the
burden
is
not
on
us
to
show
that
congress
intended
that
these
matters
were
to
continue.
it's
the
burden
of
the
respondents
to
show
with
crystal
clarity,
i
would
suggest,
that
it
was
congress'
intent
to
do
away
with
these
tort
actions.
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
tension
issue,
congress
was
willing
to
accept
the
tension
that
these
lawsuits
might
produce.
and
again,
when
we
talk
about
these
lawsuits,
we
talk
about,
is
it
realistic
to
assume
that
it's
going
to
change
the
behavior
of
this
industry?
is
it
realistic
to
assume
a
failure
to
warn
claim
will
require
them
to
change
their
warning
label--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--there
is
no
question
that
there
are
those
who
think
that
this...
products
liability
is
the
way
to
affect
behavior.
but
the
basic
concept
of
products
liability
is
premised
upon
compensation
as
opposed
to
anything
else.
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
could
impose
absolute
liability,
they
can
impose
a
tax
upon
cigarette
manufacturers,
use
that
tax
to
pay
for
the
injuries
that
occur
to
smokers.
that
would
not
be
preempted.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
no,
they're
not
regulations.
they're
not
regulatory.
they
may
have
some
indirect
effect,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
don't
think
it's
a
harder
case.
i
think
congress
was
willing
to
stand
by
that
also.
just
one
more...
i
want
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
just
one
other
matter
on
the
conflict
issue.
the
manufacturers,
in
order
to
make
sure
that
their
consumers
are
adequately
warned,
could
probably...
i
mean,
there
are
a
myriad
of
ways
of
resolving
that,
but
the
most
effective
way
is
just
to
stop
their
intentional
concerted
effort
to
neutralize
the
government
action.
it's
really
quite
a
thought
to
think
that
congress--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--as
part
of
the
lump,
judge?
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i'll
take
whatever
i
can
get,
justice.
[laughter]
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
do.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
i
would
be
satisfied
in
part
but
not
in
whole.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
since
we've
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
the
1969
language
of
1334(b),
i
just
wish
to
point
out
one
thing.
that
if
a
jury
was
to
say,
cigarette
manufacturer,
you
failed
to
adequately
inform
your
consumers
about
the
health
hazards
of
cigarettes,
what
requirements
or
prohibitions
would
that
impose
on
cigarette
manufacturers
in
their
advertising
and
promotion?
none.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
marc
z.
edell
but
we're
talking
about
this
specific
language,
advertising
and
promotion.
that's
the
broader
language
that
respondents
seem
to
fall
back
on.
and
in
this
specific
language,
a
failure
to
warn
claim
or
an
inadequate
warn
claim--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--you
do
it
through
a
variety
of
means.
i
mean,
you
can
take
out
an
ad
in
the
newspaper
like--
mr.
marc
z.
edell
--not
an
ad
in
terms
of
a
product
ad.
what
you
do
is
you
say,
instead
of
saying
r.j.
reynolds,
can
we
have
an
open
debate
on
cigarette
smoking
and
health,
what
you
do
is
you
say,
you
know
what,
the
surgeon
general's
right.
cigarette
smoking
does
cause
cancer,
heart
disease.
it's
the
major
cause
of
disease,
preventable
death
in
the
united
states,
kills
400,000
americans
every
year.
maybe
that's
what's
necessary
when
you
look
at--
