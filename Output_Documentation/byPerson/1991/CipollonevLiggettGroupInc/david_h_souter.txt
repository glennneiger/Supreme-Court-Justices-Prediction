david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
say,
isn't
the
sort
of
the
limit
of
the
obvious
effectiveness
of
your
argument,
though,
in
the
fact
that
when
you
speak
of
congress
establishing
substantive
standards,
and
as
you
did
earlier,
standards
of
conduct,
that
simply
leaves
open
the
question
whether
congress
is
establishing
substantive
standards
for
advertising
and
promotion
or
substantive
standards
governing
ultimate
liability.
clearly,
they're
establishing
substantive
standards
for
advertising
and
promotion.
nobody
would
disagree.
i
assume
nobody
would
disagree
with
you
there.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
closest
you've
come
so
far
to
an
argument
that
those
substantive
standards
go
beyond
advertising
and
promotion
to
the
questions
of
ultimate
liability
or
ultimate
conduct,
if
you
will,
in
selling
cigarettes
is
in
the
remark
that
you
made
earlier
that
in
the
debate
over
the
scope
of
the
original
act,
congress
clarified
it
in
the
1969
amendments
in
favor
of
a
broad
rather
than
a
narrow
reading.
is
your
best
argument
for
that
reading
of
congress'
clarification
the
language
of
the
1969
amendments
or
can
you
point
to
some
kind
of
an
explicit
statement
in
legislative
history
in
which
somebody
says,
we're
taking
the
broad
view
by
using
this
new
language?
justice
david
h.
souter
now
your
argument
would
also
be
consistent
with...
the
argument
that
you
have
just
made
would
be
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
'69
amendment
if
that
text
had
omitted
the
language
with
respect
to
the
advertising
or
promotion
of
cigarettes,
wouldn't
it?
in
other
words,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
put
in
that
qualification
with
respect
to
advertising
and
promotion
if
they
wanted
to
find
the
clearest
way
to
occupy
the
field
not
merely
of
promotion,
but
of
all
regulation
including
promotion.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it
was
involved
with
the
means,
if
you
will,
of
providing
these
regulations.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
means
being
the
use
of
advertising
and
promotion
to
sell
the
cigarettes
as
opposed
to
regulating,
let's
say,
through
tort
law
which
might
be
a
source
of
regulation
if
there
were
no
advertising
whatsoever.
