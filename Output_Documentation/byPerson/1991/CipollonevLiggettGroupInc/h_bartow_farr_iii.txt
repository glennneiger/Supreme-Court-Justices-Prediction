mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
briefly
summarize
why
we
think
that
the
act
preempts
the
claims
at
issue
here.
first,
it
was
the
judgment
of
congress
reflected
in
the
act
that
the
federal
government
should
make
the
ultimate
decisions
about
what
cigarette
companies
must
or
must
not
say.
that
is
that
it,
along
with
the
federal
agencies,
should
set
the
standards
of
conduct
that
the
companies
were
required
to
meet
in
this
area.
to
carry
out
this
scheme,
the
states
were
preempted
from
setting
their
own
standards
of
conduct,
and
it
naturally
follows
that
unless
congress
says
otherwise
in
the
act,
that
congress
also
means
to
preempt
the
states
from
enforcing
their
standards
of
conduct,
whether
they
choose
to
do
so
by
sanctions,
like
fines,
or
remedial
provisions,
like
damages
and
injunctions.
second,
congress
did
not
mean
to
preempt
just
some
state
restrictions.
although
congress
clearly
was
concerned
and
wanted
to
preempt
the
ability
of
the
states
to
require
warnings
in
advertisements,
it
wanted
to
preempt
any
restrictions,
like
bans
on
advertising
or
partial
bans
on
advertising
that
would
upset
the
balance
of
interest,
national
interest,
that
congress
itself
had
struck
in
the
act.
and
that
scope
of
preemption
covers
all
the
claims
before
this
court.
now
in
discussing
the
question
of
preemption,
i
think
it
is
useful
to
keep
in
mind
the
background
against
which
congress
was
legislating
in
this
area.
as
petitioner
has
noted,
after
the
surgeon
general's
report
came
out,
there
were
a
number
of
different
proposals
regarding
restrictions
that
could
be
put
on
the
marketing
of
cigarettes.
there
were
a
number
of
different
warnings
that
had
been
drafted
and
proposed,
and
there
were
proposals
to
require
warnings
on
packages,
to
require
warnings
in
advertisements,
to
ban
advertising
altogether
as
far
as
cigarettes
were
concerned,
or
less
restrictive
bans
on
advertising.
and
what
congress
recognized,
correctly,
was
that
this
was
a
national
problem
and
it
needed
a
national
solution.
and
thus,
that
it
was
the
federal
government,
congress
together
with
the
agencies,
that
would
have
to
ultimately
set
the
requirements
that
the
companies
would
have
to
meet.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
is
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
it
is
that
congress
would--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--we
both
agree
and
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
certainly
would
defend
the
part
of
it
in
which
it
found
preemption.
what
i
would
say
differently,
justice
white,
is
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
frankly,
gave
enough
weight
to
the
plain
language
of
section
1334(b).
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
clearly,
the
courts
were
interpreting
the
'69
statute.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
don't.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
be
content
to
rest
my
case
on
the
'65
statute,
but
let
me
explain
the
difference
between
your
question
and
my
answer,
if
i
might.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
to
start,
the
1969
act,
i
think,
clearly
preempts
by
its
very
terms
requirements
and
prohibitions.
the
1965
act,
as
far
as
1334(b)
is
concerned,
which
is
not
the
entire
act,
of
course,
but
just
that
specific
preemption
provision,
does
not
contain
as
broad
language
as
the
'69
act.
our
position,
however,
is
the
act
as
a
whole--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
but
our
contention
is
that
the
act
as
a
whole,
when
you
take
into
account
the
purposes
and
policies
of
section
1331,
was
in
fact
intended
even
for
that
4-year
period
to
also
cover
what
the
1969
act
clearly
covers.
and
what
happened
in
fact,
and
the
legislative
history
supports
this...
in
1969,
what
was
before
congress
was
essentially
a
debate
about
the
scope
of
the
1965
act.
a
number
of
congressmen
took
the
position
that
the
1965
act
essentially
covered
only
what
your
question
would
suggest,
justice
stevens,
simply
requirements
about
statements
in
advertising.
and
that
was
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
taken
here
in
d.c.
in
the
banzhaf
case.
however,
a
number
of
other
congressmen
said
that
is
not
what
the
1965
statute
did.
what
it
did
was
preempted
all
state
regulation
of
advertising.
and
what
congress
did
in
1969,
therefore,
and
what
the
senate
report
indicates,
is
that
it
clarified
what
the
meaning
of
the
1965
act
as
a
whole
was
intended
to
be.
so
we
believe
that
in
fact
the
scope
of
both
acts
is
the
same.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
we
believe
that
the
field
is
essentially
the
same.
i
mean,
to
some
extent
any
preemptive
provision
preempts
some
field,
and
that's
of
course
what
we're
saying.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
the
entire
act
should
be
read
together.
this
is
why
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
say
we
are
relying
only
on
one
theory
of
preemption.
because
we
think
you
can
get
there
by
a
number
of
different
routes.
to
start
with,
as
i
said,
we
think
the
language
of
1334(a)
and
(b)
together
convey
a
very
broad
scope
of
preemption.
they
cover
all
requirements
regarding
warnings
and
labeling.
they
require
all...
rather
they
cover
all
requirements
and
prohibitions
with
respect
to
advertising
and
promotion.
however,
even
if
you
didn't
have
that,
what
you
do
have
all
along
is
a
clear
intention
by
congress
to
set
the
policy
in
the
field.
section
1331
talks
about
a
comprehensive
federal
program
whereby
the
public
will
be
warned.
and
yet,
and
this
is
an
important
part,
at
the
same
time
congress
was
concerned
that
the
national
economy
not
be
unduly
disrupted
and
that
the
companies
not
be
subjected
to
disuniform,
in
its
word,
diverse
and
disuniform
regulations.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
set
a
ceiling
on
the
amount
of
information
that
consumers
would
receive.
i
think
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
set
a
regulatory
structure,
in
other
words,
a
structure
in
which
the
federal
government
would
set
the
requirements
for
what
the
companies
had
to
do.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
what
congress
did
in
the
area
of
warnings,
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
is
to
say
the
companies
have
to
provide
this
particular
warning
on
their
packaging.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
the
both
the
minimum
and
the
maximum
that
they
are
required
to
put
on
their
package.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
requirements
go,
it
is
a
floor
and
a
ceiling.
congress
did
not
leave
open--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--assuming
they're
not
required
to
do
so
by
state
law,
but
are
simply
acting
on
their
own?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
ask
the
question
because
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
read
the
act
as
specifically
prohibiting
a
manufacturer
from
putting
additional
warnings
on
a
package.
however--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--no,
i
do
not.
that
is
the
distinction
that
i
am
drawing.
i
think
the
act
quite
clearly
is
talking
about
the
power
of
the
states
to
require
additional
warning.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
any
case
in
which
you
are
examining
preemption
starts
with
that
presumption.
but
i
think
the
next
question
is
at
what
point
is
that
presumption
properly
overcome.
the
position
we
would
take
is
that
when
congress
says
in
plain
language
in
the
act
that
states
may
not
impose
any
other
requirements
within
a
particular
field,
whether
it
happens
to
be
labeling
or
whether
it
is
advertising
and
promotion,
and
indeed
where
the
structure
of
the
act
makes
clear
that
congress
itself
is
the
one
that
wants
to
set
the
policies
and
set
the
requirements
for
good
reason,
that
that
itself
overcomes
any
presumption
against
preemption.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
i
think
that,
in
fact,
points
out
the
very
clear
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
situation
that
you
have
in
the
smokeless
act,
and
in
fact,
in
silkwood
and
goodyear
atomic,
which
were
mentioned
earlier.
our
position
is
that
when
congress
preempts
the
ability
of
the
states
to
set
substantive
standards,
the
natural
conclusion
is
that
congress
has
also
preempted
any
ability
on
the
part
of
the
states
to
enforce
those
standards,
as
i
said
before,
by
fines,
by
criminal
penalties,
by
suits
for
damages,
by
injunctions.
the
exception
is
where
congress
makes
clear
in
the
act
that
despite
its
preemption
of
the
standards,
it
is
willing
to
tolerate
some
particular
form
of
enforcement.
in
other
words,
that
it
is
willing
to
have
its
policies
frustrated.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
there
is
both,
justice
souter.
i
think
what
congress
was
dealing
with,
frankly
throughout,
from
1965
on,
was
the
variety
of
different
means
of
regulation,
a
variety
of
different
efforts
at
both
the
state
and
the
federal
level
to
impose
restrictions
on
cigarette
companies.
and
i
think
what
congress
did
was
to
say
quite
explicitly,
certainly
in
1969
explicitly,
that
we
do
not
want
the
states
to
be
imposing
requirements
or
prohibitions
in
this
area.
that,
supported
by
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
makes
clear
that
congress
does
not
want
a
state,
for
example,
to
require
that
a
warning
be
put
in
an
advertisement.
i
think
that's
common
ground
among
the
parties
here.
that,
at
the
very
minimum,
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
however,
the
problem
is
from
there
on
there
is
really
no
sensible
place
to
draw
any
line.
if
a
state
can
say
all
right,
maybe
we're
preempted
from
requiring
a
warning,
what
we
will
do
is
we'll
ban
advertising
altogether,
or
we'll
ban
advertising
that
doesn't
carry
a
warning,
or
we
will
say
that
any
advertising
even
if
it
does
carry
a
warning,
but
shows
attractive
subjects,
pleasant
settings,
is
misleading
because
it
suggests
that
smoking
and
health
are
compatible
and
we
as
a
state
have
made
the
judgment
that
they
are
not.
in
all
of
those
situations,
it
seems
to
me,
congress
is
saying
this
is
not
something
we
want
the
states
to
be
free
to
do.
if
such
action
is
necessary,
we
will
take
it.
and
of
course,
in
1969...
excuse
me,
just
to
finish
the
answer...
in
1969,
of
course,
congress
stepped
in
and
did
ban
some
advertising,
with
respect
to
broadcast
advertising.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
well,
justice
souter,
i'm
sorry.
i
want
to
make
clear
what
my
position
is
and
perhaps
i
have
not
made
it
clear.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
congress
has
occupied
the
entire
field
of
smoking
and
health.
the
field
that
we
are
talking
about
is
essentially
the
requirements
that
can
be
imposed
with
regard
to
information
about
smoking
and
health,
what
i
loosely
called
at
the
beginning
what
the
companies
must
say,
what
the
companies
must
not
say.
that
is
what
congress
was
directly
involved
in.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
depends
on
what
the
aim
of
the
particular
law
is.
again,
we're
not
suggesting
that
all
tort
suits
are
preempted.
we
have
said
in
our
brief
that
tort
suits
based,
for
example,
on
fairly
common
strict
liability
theories
like
manufacturing
defects
or
design
defects
are
not
preempted.
and
we're
not
suggesting
here
that
that
is
part
of
the
field
that
congress
has
occupied.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
the
question
is
could
a
state
regulate
that
or
provide
a
tort
suit
based
on
that,
our
answer
is
no,
that
that
is
something
that
is
corrected
at
the
federal
level,
and
clearly
would
be
corrected
by
the
ftc.
they
would
be
down
on
the
cigarette
companies
in
a
minute
for
doing
something
like
that.
but
the
congress
did
not
intend--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
let
me
explain
why
that
is
true.
that
what
you
have
here
is
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
decide
where
the
lines
begin
and
end.
now
i'm
sure
that
if
congress
was
confident
that
it
could
say
we
will
allow
some
state
requirements,
as
long
as
those
requirements
only
go
to
the
most
egregious
examples
of
conduct,
that
congress
might
well
have
considered
that.
but
that,
i
think,
is
simply
an
impractical
way
to
look
at
the
system.
that
once
you
say
to
the
states
we
are
going
to
allow
you
to
apply
your
standards
in
this
field,
whether
it's
to
intentional
misrepresentation
to
whatever
an
adequate
warning
would
be,
at
that
point,
you
essentially
cannot
have
national
standards.
you
can't
have
both
national
standards
and
have
51
or
more
state
standards.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
if
that
were
true,
justice
scalia,
then
the
state
could
have
a
general
standard
that
says
you
have
to
give
adequate
warnings
about
products
that
you
sell
in
this
state,
and
say,
we're
not
saying
that
you...
we're
not
applying
a
specific
standard
to
cigarettes,
we're
just
applying
our
general
standard
to
your
warning.
and
it's
not
adequate.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
problem
is
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
that...
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
was
essentially
playing
a
guessing
game
here.
what
congress
said
was
if
you
are
indiscreet
enough
to
pass
a
specific
statute
or
apply,
or
to
have
a
law
that
is
specific
with
regard
to
cigarettes,
and
that
requires
a
different
warning,
or
that
prohibits
something
in
advertising,
that's
perfectly
all
right
with
us,
even
though
it
will
have
exactly
the
same
effect
on
the
national
policies
and
all
of
that,
we're
willing
to
tolerate
that.
but,
if
in
fact...
excuse
me,
we're
not
willing
to
tolerate
that.
but
if
you
have
a
general
prohibition
and
then
apply
it
specifically
to
cigarettes
to
say
this
warning
is
not
good
enough,
this
kind
of
advertising
can't
be
allowed
in
our
state,
that's
perfectly
acceptable
to
us.
the
effect
of
both
of
them
is
exactly
the
same.
let
me
take
an
example.
if
a
state
has
a
statute
that
says
we
do
not
permit
deceptive
or
misleading
advertising
in
this
state,
and
we
have
an
agency
that
is
set
up
to
administer
this
statute.
and
it
will
review
your
advertising
to
determine
whether
it
is
permitted
or
not.
and
that
agency
then
determines
that
any
advertising
by
a
cigarette
company
is
inherently
misleading
unless
it
just
has
the
name
of
the
cigarette.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
so
long
as
the
agency
is
acting
that
way
and
not...
or
by
a
specific
adjudication,
that
it
would
make
any
difference.
and
yet
one
would
be
more
general,
one
would
be
more
specific,
and
the
overall
statute
could
be
quite
general.
but
the
effect,
ultimately,
is
the
same.
what
the
state
is
saying
is,
in
our
state,
you
have
to
meet
these
standards
of
conduct,
and
that
is
essentially
the
price
that
you
have
to
pay
to
market
in
our
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not
under
the
analysis
that
i
am
talking
about.
now,
but
i
want
to
be
clear.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
this
is
the
point--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if...
let
me
give
the
answer
that
says
it
is
not
preempted
under
the
analysis
that
i
am
talking
about.
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
under
this
statute
which
is
not
part
of
the
argument
that
we're
making
with
respect
to
these
claims,
that
congress
expected
cigarettes
could
be
sold
lawfully
in
the
state.
but
that
is
a
completely
different
analysis
from
the
analysis
that
i'm
making,
starting
with
the
preemption
provisions
in
1334(b).
what
they
relate
to
are
labeling,
advertising,
and
promotion.
now
the
example
that
you've
given,
justice
white,
simply
does
not
fit
within
that
field,
so--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
this
in
fact
goes
back,
i
think,
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
about
what
do
the
words
"based
on"
mean.
every
claim
in
this
case
quite
clearly
is
based
on
some
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
you
did
not
warn
enough
about
smoking
and
health.
you
misrepresented
the
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
not--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
that's
the
point
that
i
was
making
earlier.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
not...
what
i
think
would
be
more
absurd,
to
borrow
that
word,
would
be
to
attribute
that
to
congress
where
congress
has
given
no
other
indication
in
the
statute.
if
congress,
as
it
did
in
silkwood,
says
explicitly
in
the
act,
there
will
be
tort
suits...
i
mean,
that's
the
necessary
implication
of
the
provision
that
was
being
construed
in
silkwood,
which
set
a
limit
on
the
damages
for
tort
suits.
or
in
goodyear
atomic,
congress
says
explicitly,
workman's
compensation
laws
will
apply
exactly
the
same
to
federal
facilities
within
states
as
they
do
to
any
other
facility.
the
smokeless
tobacco
act,
again,
you
have
an
explicit
provision.
so
at
that
point
it
is
entirely
legitimate,
it
seems
to
me,
for
the
court
to
say
congress
is
willing
to
accept
the
tension
between
some
regulation
and
the
effort
to
set
uniform
national
standards
or
to
protect
federal
facilities
or
whatever
the
federal
goal
is
but
not--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--justice
white,
let
me...
you
see,
i
think
there's
a
little
bit
of
a
misconception
about
the
relationship
between
the
remedies
and
the
standards.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
there's
more
than
that.
let
me
set
out,
if
i
can...
excuse
me.
let
me
set
out
if
i
can
what
i
think
is
the
landscape
as
far
as
remedies
are
concerned.
what
congress
has
clearly
prohibited
are
remedies
based
on
state
requirements.
that
is
what
congress,
we
say,
has
shut
down.
state
requirements
within
the
field
of
labeling,
advertising,
and
promotion,
what
the
companies
can
and
cannot
say.
however,
that
doesn't
exhaust
the
field,
to
begin
with.
there
are
other
types
of
suits
that
can
be
brought
connected
with
smoking
which
are
outside
the
field
entirely,
as
i've
indicated
before.
so
when
the
plaintiffs
are
saying
there
is
not
a
remedy
here,
when
they
are
saying,
for
example,
there
is
not
a
remedy
for
failure
to
warn,
what
they're
really
saying
is
there
is
not
a
failure
for
not...
there
is
not
a
remedy
for
not
giving
a
greater
warning
than
the
warning
that
congress
required
and
said
was
the
only
warning
that
you
could
be
required
to
give.
in
the
misrepresentation
field,
for
example,
to
the
extent
that
the
claims
are
based,
as
they
typically
are,
on
standard
product
advertising,
that
again
is
specifically
an
area
in
which
the
congress
did
not
want
the
states
to
be
able
to
set
requirements.
so
the
fact
that
one
would
say
you
have
engaged,
in
our
view,
in
misleading
advertising
within
our
state
because
you
have
shown,
as
i
say,
attractive
people
in
an
ad,
or
an
attractive
setting,
the
fact
that
you
cannot
bring
a
claim
for
that
and
get
a
remedy
any
more
than
an
agency
could
fine
you
for
doing
the
same
thing
is
because
congress
did
not
intend
the
states
to
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not...
one
could
do
that,
but
the
claims--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
claims
before
this
court
are
not
those
claims.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
emphasize.
the
claims
here
are
not
claims
in
which
somebody
simply
says
the
product
is
dangerous.
they
are
claims
based
on--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
that
was
the
point.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
preemption
provisions
do
not
apply
if
you
do
not
comply
with
the
specific
federal
requirement
about
the
warning
on
the
package.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
justice
scalia,
the
short
answer
is
no.
but
the
reason--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry,
there
is
no
remedy.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
ftc
will
take
care
of
it.
the
difficulty...
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
here
at
the
end
is
that
when
you
were
talking
about
the
extreme
hypothetical,
the
one,
obviously,
that
causes
anybody
discomfort
when
they're
thinking
about
the
conduct,
that
is
precisely
the
conduct
that
the
ftc
would
be
on
instantly.
it
could
get
temporary
restraining
orders
against
it,
could
stop
before
it
even
happened.
and
congress
clearly
understood
that
power.
it
reaffirmed
the
power
of
the
ftc,
it
urged
the
ftc
to
use
it
liberally.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
you're
saying
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
it
would...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
ultimately
be
a
deceptive
act
or
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
it
is
the
kind
of
deception
on
which
you
could
base
a
state
tort
claim,
i
am
quite
confident
that
the
ftc
would
have
jurisdiction
to
handle
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
terms
of
their
product
advertising,
justice
stevens?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
misspoke
then.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
they
could
take
that
step
in
order
to
adequately
inform.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
they
can
do
it
in
a
variety
of
other
ways.
they
could
make
sure
that
their
consumers
are
adequately
informed.
as
i
said
before,
they
could
stop
their
concerted
effort
to
neutralize
the
effectiveness
of
the
health
warning.
they,
through
nonproduct
promotion,
nonproduct
public
relations
that
is
unconstrained
by
the
ftc.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
when
you're
talking
about--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
it
gives
them
the
discretion
if
they
want
to
take
some
remedial
measures.
requirement
forces
you
to
do
it.
if
you
want
to
take
some
remedial
measures,
there
are
myriad
ways
of
doing
it
other
than
a
way
that
would
conflict
with
the
act.
thank
you.
