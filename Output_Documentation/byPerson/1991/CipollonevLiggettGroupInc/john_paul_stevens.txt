justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if,
in
following
up
to
justice
scalia's
question,
the
court
also
granted
an
injunction
against
the
future
sale
of
cigarettes
unless
it
had
that
warning
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
hypothetical
was
a
little
simpler.
my
hypothetical
was
an
action
for
damages.
at
the
end
of
the
complaint
he
says,
and
i
also
ask
for
such
other
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
and
after
entering
the
injunction...
and
he
sues
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
people
who
smoke
a
lot...
after
getting
a
damage
judgment
the
court
does
enter
the
equitable
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
new
jersey's
court
system
doesn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
not
sure
where
you
came
down
with
punitive
damages.
what
about
punitive
damages?
is
that
a
harder
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
regard,
mr.
farr,
do
you
think
it
looked
at
the
plain
language
of
the
'65
statute
or
the
'69
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
the
'69
statute
changed
the
meaning
of
the
'65
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
be
content
to
rest
your
case
on
the
language
of
the
'65
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
only
relates
to
statements
in
advertising.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
only
relates
to
statements
in
advertising.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
surely
tell
them
they
had
to
do
something
more
than
they'd
done
in
the
facts
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
tell
them
that
the
warning
proscribed
by
the
federal
government
was
not
adequate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
you
ever
warn
except
through
advertising
and
promotion
and
labeling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
part
of
advertising.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
what's
necessary
to
avoid
tort
liability,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
imposing
a
requirement
there,
a
prohibition,
in
the
teeth
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
say
their
failure
to
do
that,
it
would
be
a
breach
of
duty
that
gives
rise
to
damage
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you're
saying
the
failure
to
take
that
step
can
give
rise
to
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
case
that
was
in
the
federal
court
because
the
diversity
of
citizenship
of
the
parties.
it
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
involves
common
law
claims
against
cigarette
manufacturers.
the
claims
arise
out
of
injuries
sustained
by
petitioner's
mother
caused
by
her
cigaret
smoking.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
most
of
the
claims
were
preempted
by
the
federal
cigarette
labeling
and
advertising
act
of
1965
and
by
a
subsequent
law
enacted
in
1969.
the
court,
therefore,
refused
to
allow
the
jury
to
consider
evidence
concerning
the
cigarette
manufacturers'
conduct
after
1965.
both
the
1965
act
and
the
1969
act
include
provisions
that
preempt
state
law
to
a
certain
extent.
the
two
provisions
are,
however,
significantly
different.
the
1965
statute
provides
that
no
statement
relating
to
smoking
and
health
shall
be
required
in
the
advertising
of
any
cigarettes,
the
packages
of
which
are
labeled
in
conformity
with
the
statute
thus,
focusing
on
particular
statements
that
might
be
required
by
state
law.
the
1969
act,
however,
is
significantly
broader
because
it
provides
that
no
requirement
or
prohibition
based
on
smoking
and
health
shall
be
imposed
under
state
law.
our
decision
today
is
based
upon
our
understanding
of
those
two
expressed
preemption
provisions
and
discusses
them
separately.
first,
we
conclude
that
the
preemption
provision
of
the
1965
act
only
prevented
states
from
mandating
particular
warning
labels
on
cigarette
packages
and
therefore,
did
not
preempt
any
of
petitioner's
common
law
claims.
justice
scalia,
in
an
opinion
joined
by
justice
thomas,
dissents
from
this
aspect
of
the
court's
ruling.
second,
we
conclude
that
the
1969
act
did
preempt
some
of
those
common
law
claims.
in
particular,
we
conclude
that
the
1969
act
expressly
preempted
petitioner's
claim
that
cigarette
manufacturers
failed
to
warn
consumers
about
the
hazards
of
smoking
in
their
advertisements
or
promotions
as
well
as
this
claim
that
the
manufacturers
neutralized
the
warnings
that
federal
law
required
them
to
place
in
cigarette
advertising.
justice
blackmun,
in
an
opinion
joined
by
justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter,
dissents
from
this
aspect
of
the
court's
holding.
they
find
no
preemption.
finally,
we
conclude
that
the
1969
act
did
not
preempt
petitioner's
remaining
claims
based
on
breach
of
express
warranties
and
fraudulent
misrepresentations.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
dissent
from
this
ruling.
for
these
reasons
that
are
explained
at
length
in
the
three
opinions
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
