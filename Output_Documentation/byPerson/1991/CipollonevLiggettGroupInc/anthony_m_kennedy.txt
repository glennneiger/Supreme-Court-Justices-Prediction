justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
a
suit
such
as
the
type
that
was
heard
here
the
judge
says,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you're
instructed
that
the
warnings
currently
on
cigarette
packages
are
required
by
federal
law,
and
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
and
state
law
they're
adequate.
and
that
you
may
impose
no
additional
prohibition
or
requirement
on
such
advertisements.
is
that
a
proper
instruction
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
is
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
instruction
to
the
jury
based
on
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
instruct
the
jury
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
forget
about
the
third
circuit's
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
think
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute?
is
the
manufacturer
entitled
to
that
instruction
based
on
your
reading
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
manufacturer's
not
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
these
labels
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
are
adequate
and
sufficient,
and
that
the
jury
may
not
impose
as
a
matter
of
state
law
any
more
restrictive
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
isn't
that
just
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just...
i
just
want
to
make
clear.
would
it
be
error
for
the
district...
for
the
trial
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
you
may
require...
you
may
impose
no
requirement
or
prohibition
other
than
what
is
set
forth
in
the
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
wrong
with
reading
a
statute
to
jury?
it's
the
law,
isn't
it?
