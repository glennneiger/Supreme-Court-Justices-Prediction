justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wallace,
is
the
reason
that
the...
statutory
basis
for
requiring
application
of
the
oklahoma
statute
section
401?
justice
david
h.
souter
i've
got
section
401
in
the
white
appendix,
starting
on
page
164a.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
specifically
what
i'm
getting
at
is
really
the
tail
end
of
it.
in
401(b),
which
in
effect
provides
that
the
permitting
agency,
based
on
the
recommendations
of
such
state,
the
administrator,
et
cetera,
shall
condition
such
license
or
permit
in
such
manner
as
may
be
necessary
as
to
ensure
compliance
with
applicable
water
quality
requirements.
is
that
how
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
that
consistent
with
what
you
described
a
moment
ago
as
the
holding
in
oullette,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
indeed
the
only
thing
the
downstream
state
really
can
do
is
to
recommend
within
the
meaning
of
section
402,
and
if
the
recommendation
isn't
taken,
too
bad.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
it
be
a
more
natural
reading,
though,
to
say
that
the
recommendation
which
is
referred
to
in
402
is
simply
a
recommendation
for
what
the
permit
ought
to
include
in
order
to
meet
the
standard,
but
that
under
section
401(b)
there
is
no
question
that
the
standard
is
enforceable.
and
the
only
thing
that
may
or
may
not
be
accepted
under
the
leeway
given
on
402
is
the
recommendation
on
how
to
do
it,
how
to
meet
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
is
that
reading
consistent
with
oullette,
which
seems
to
leave
the
epa
with
a
much
greater
leeway?
justice
david
h.
souter
true,
but
section
401,
if
i
understand
it,
provides
that
that
role
will
not
be
subsidiary
to
the
point
of
ignoring
that
state's
requirement
once
it
is...
water
quality
plan,
once
it's
been
approved
by
epa.
you
can't--
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
if
that's
the
case
and
the
oklahoma
water
quality
plan
has
got
to
be
applied,
then
is
the...
is
the
relevant
section
of
the
oklahoma
plan
what
is
set
out
on
page
46
and
47
of
the
joint
appendix,
section
5,
the
beneficial
use
limitations?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
my
particular
problem,
my
reason
for
raising
section
5,
is
that
if
section
5
is
applicable...
it
says
all
streams
and
bodies
of
water
designated
as
a,
which
i
assume
is
applying
here,
are
protected
by
prohibition
of
any
new
point
source
discharge.
this
is
a
new...
what
is
at
issue
here
is
a
new
point
source
discharge,
and
that
would
be
absolutely
prohibited
if
that
section
must
be
enforced
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
it
boils
down
to
then,
is
that
in
order
to
sustain
epa,
a
court
would
have
to
say
that
the
prohibition
of
any
new
point
source
discharge
can
be
read
to
allow
a
new
point
source
discharge
if
the
effect
of
it
is
not
detectable
at
the
relevant
point
downstream.
that's
sort
of
the
nub
of
the
reasonable
interpretation
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
with
this
question?
if
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
epa
has
no
control
over
what
you
referred
to
as
possibly
contradicting
or
inconsistent
standards,
as
between
upstream
states
and
downstream
states,
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
because
you'd
say
at
some
point
somebody's
got
to
arbitrate
between
these
differences,
who
better
than
epa?
but
isn't
the
assumption
at
least
a
strange
assumption
because
epa
has
got
to
approve
these
standards
in
the
first
place.
and
if
epa
is
being
given
a
standard
by
oklahoma
which,
if
applied,
would
clearly
be
inconsistent
with
what
the
upstream
state
is
asking
for
in
its
standards,
isn't
the
rational
thing
for
epa
either
to
say
no,
we
won't
approve
it
because
it's
too
tough
in
relation
to
what's
upstream,
or
to
say
upstream,
we
won't
approve
yours
because
it's
too
weak
in
relation
to
downstream.
and
isn't
that
the
rational
way,
if
we're
going
to
have
a
national
scheme
or
an
interstate
scheme,
isn't
that
the
rational
way
to
resolve
the
differences
between
the
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
insofar
as
it
may
have
an
interstate
implication?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
do
you
think
there's
essentially
a
contradiction...
between
401
and
402,
because
402
has
a
much
more
permissive
sound
if
we
read
recommendation
in
the
way
you
want
us
to
read
it.
401,
however,
which
in
the
operative
phrase
refers
to
conditions
such
as
may
be
necessary
to
ensure
compliance
with
applicable
water
quality
standards,
you
say
is
essentially
weak
provision
because
what
is
applicable
is
what
epa
thinks
ought
to
be
applicable.
isn't
the
more
natural
reading
of
401's
applicable
water
quality
requirements
in
subsection
2,
shouldn't
it
be
taken
as
a
reference
to
the
enumeration
of
applicable
statutory
sections
in
subsection
1.
in
other
words,
to
ensure
a
certification
that
the
discharge
will
comply
with
the
applicable
provisions
of
1311
and
so
on
through
1317.
isn't
that
the
more
natural
reading
of
the
statute?
and
if
it
is,
1313
is
the
one
that
refers
to
the
approval
of
state
plans,
and
that
would
pick
up
the
state
plan
and
make
it
enforceable.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
trouble
is
it's
still
there,
though.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
if
401
were
applicable,
wouldn't
you
have
that
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
to
get
to
that
point,
what
oullette
did
was
in
effect
to
analyze
the...
in
effect,
the
structure
of
the
statute
in
a
way
which
is
directly
relevant
to
our
question.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
hold
your
way
without
saying
that
oullette's
description
of
the
way
this
statute
worked
was
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
oullette
was
wrong
in
the
description
of
the
structure
of
this
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
may
i
interrupt
you?
does
epa
have
an
authority
as
broad
as
the
one
i
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago
your
opposing
counsel,
of
saying
you
know,
this
is
too
tough
because,
if
enforced,
it's
going
to
be
too
restrictive
on
the
upstream
states.
even
though
it's
a
great
plan
and
it
might
be
nice
if
it
were
simply
an
intrastate
issue,
we
won't
approve
it
for
that
reason.
does
epa
have
that
much
authority
in
303?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
theory,
it's
set
by
the
highest
common
denominator.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
your
answer
to
the
objection,
if
it
is
an
objection,
is
that
it's
up
to
epa
to
decide
how
high
that
denominator's
going
to
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
they
also
be
supplicants
as
to
epa's
approval?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that...
i'm
sorry.
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
the
answer
that
you
just
gave
to
me
when
you...
i
thought
you
said
that
there
was
a
point
at
which
in
that
process
the
upstream
state
could
be
a
supplicant
to
epa.
but
that's
just
not
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
downstream
state.
but
epa
doesn't
have
a
role
in
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
correct?
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
epa
does
not
have
dispositive
role
in
the
decision
on
this
question.
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
when
you're
talking...
if
i
understand
you,
you're
talking
about
two
different
things.
we're
talking
about
designation
of
rivers,
on
the
one
hand,
and
water
quality
standards
on
the
other.
river
designation,
epa
doesn't
have
a
dispositive
role.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
upstream
state
is
nothing
but
a
supplicant
to
the
downstream
state,
on
your
view.
that's
the
best
it
can
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
no.
on
the
designation
of
the
river.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
designation
of
the
river
is
operative,
that's
the
end
of
the
game.
because
if
that
controls,
then
it
doesn't
do
them
much
good
to
have
a
role
as
objectors
with
respect
to
water
quality
which
is
intended
to
satisfy
or
to
preserve
the
status
of
the
river
which
is
now
binding
upon
everybody.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
you
must,
but
isn't
it
true
that
on
the
analysis
you've
just
given
us,
once
the
river
is
designated,
that's
basically
the
end
of
the
game,
so
far
as
what
the
upstream
state
can
reasonably
expect
to
be
allowed
to
do
in
the
future.
everything
hinges
on
the
designation
of
that
river.
justice
david
h.
souter
--into
a
more
polluted
river,
i
think,
yeah.
well,
but
we
don't...
the
trouble
is
we
don't
know,
at
least
i
don't
think
we
know,
how
it
is
that
the
concentration
of
pollution
in
oklahoma
gets
to
be
that
way.
it
may
be,
for
all
i
know,
that
oklahoma
is
the
one
that's
principally
messing
up
the
river.
and
therefore,
arkansas
might
not
want
it
all
because
its
share
of
the
river
is
cleaner.
and
yet
it
might
still
be
the
case,
on
justice
stevens'
argument,
that
the
amount
of
extra
water
that
is
being
discharged
along
with
the
6
pounds
of
phosphorous
would
actually
effect
an
improvement
of
the
river
once
it
gets
to
the
dirty
section
in
oklahoma.
i
mean
that...
and
in
fact
that,
at
least
the
latter
part
of
my
suggestion,
is
a
claim
here,
even
though
there's
no
finding.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that...
that
was
your
earlier
answer.
in
other
words,
you're
not
saying
that
they
could
never
discharge
into
the
river.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
simply
saying
the
can't
discharge
if
any
measurable
quantity
passes
the
line
into
oklahoma.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
butkin,
may
i
ask
you
to
switch
gears
for
a
second,
'cause
your
time
is
drawing
to
a
close,
and
there's
something
i
don't
understand.
section
401
refers
to,
in
at
least
in
what
i
thought
might
be
the
referent
to
what
would
be
an
applicable
water
quality
requirement.
it
referred
to
a
series
of
other
statutes,
including
1313,
which
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
section
under
which
water
quality
standards
are
promulgated
and
approved.
section
402
does
not
seem
to
mention
1313
at
all.
and
it
says
later
on,
as
you
know,
in
section
402
that
this
recommendation
process
is
authorized.
is
there
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
1313,
referring
to
water
quality
standards,
is
not
referenced
in
402
with
its
provision
for
this
process
of
recommendation
and
acceptance
or
rejection?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
thank
you.
