mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
judicial
review
of
the
validity
of
an
action
taken
by
a
federal
agency
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute,
namely
the
issuance
of
a
permit
by
epa
for
a
new
sewage
treatment
plant
in
fayetteville,
arkansas,
issuance
of
a
permit
under
the
clean
water
act.
and
under
that
federal
statute,
the
permitting
authority
is
to
assure
compliance
with
applicable
water
quality
requirements,
and
this
includes
compliance
with
the
epa-approved
water
quality
standards
of
a
downstream
state.
the
key
to
this
case
in
our
view
lies
in
appreciating
the
fundamental
importance
under
the
federal
statute
of
a
rather
elusive
distinction,
but
one
that
is
not
formalistic,
for
reasons
i
will
try
to
explain.
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
law
of
the
downstream
state,
and
the
federally
approved
water
quality
standards
adopted
by
that
state,
but
that
apply
in
the
permitting
process
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
under
the
clean
water
act.
the
foundation
on
which
we
are
building
this
distinction
really
is
reflected
in
two
of
the
holdings
of
this
court
the
last
time
it
considered
this
general
subject
in
international
paper
company
against
oullette.
one
of
those
holdings
was
that
the
downstream
state's
law
is
not
preempted
by
the
clean
water
act
insofar
as
it
applies
to
sources
in
that
state.
no
state
law
is
preempted
as
it
applies
within
the
state
to
sources
in
that
state.
no
federal
approval
of
such
state
law
is
needed.
it
takes
effect
if
it's
enacted
by
the
state.
the
other
foundation
holding
in
international
paper
against
oullette
is
that
the
clean
water
act
does
preempt
application
of
a
state's
law
to
discharges
in
another
state.
so
it's
only
if
the
out
of
state,
the
affected
state,
the
downstream
state's
standards
are
approved
by
epa,
that
they
are
to
be
applied
in
the
permitting
process
in
the
source
state.
and
what
is
significant
in
the
federal
act,
and
not
emphasized
in
our
brief
as
much
as
i
think
its
significance
would
warrant,
is
that
the
federal
act
in
its
implementing
regulation
require
that
certain
processes
be
followed
in
the
adoption
or
review
of
state
standards
if
they
are
to
qualify
for
epa
approval.
and
the
most
relevant
process
that's
required
is
requirements
for
public
hearings
and
public
participation,
at
which
affected
persons
and
states
would
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
about
the
impact
of
water
quality
standards
on
their
operations.
and
epa
itself
is
a
very
active
participant
in
the
development
of
these
water
quality
standards.
it
provides
technical
guidance
through
participation
in
these
hearings,
consultation,
model
regulations,
et
cetera,
and
moreover,
a
renewed
opportunity
to
be
heard.
in
fact,
the
statute
requires
hearings
every...
to
be
conducted
every
3
years
to
get
public
participation
about
needed
revisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
well
as
the
affected
state's.
deference
with
respect
to
all
applicable
water
quality
standards
that
the
clean
water
act
requires
epa
to
apply
in
issuing
the
permit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
applicable
law...
oklahoma
is
the
affected
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
source
is
in
arkansas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what's
at
issue
is
whether
oklahoma's
water
quality
standards
are
violated
the
affected
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
statute
does
require
epa
to
defer
in
administering
its
program
to
the
source
states
where
the
discharge
is
occurring...
here
arkansas...
to
the
source
state's
interpretation
of
its
own
standards,
because
those
standards
are
applicable
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
anyone
making
a
discharge
in
arkansas
anyway.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
you
see
this
court
already
held
in
international
paper
company
against
oullette
that
oklahoma
cannot
apply
its
law
to
a
discharge
in
arkansas,
that
a
state's
law
cannot
apply
to
an
out-of-state
discharge,
that
the
clean
water
act
preempts
that.
what
can
apply,
what
does
apply,
are
water
quality
standards
that
happen
to
be
adopted
in
that
state
law
that
epa
approved
after
the
federal
statutory
processes
were
followed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
precisely
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
that
it
is
epa
that
is
in...
that
is
both
the
expert
agency
and
the
fulcrum
agency
to
understand
what
informed
participants
in
the
processes
that
the
federal
act
requires
would
have
thought
those
standards
meant.
otherwise
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
correct.
and
the
basis
of
that
understanding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
point.
it's
only
federal
law
that
can
apply
because
state
law
is
preempted
from
applying
out
of
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
decision
to
issue
a
permit
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
that
is
the
proceeding
that's
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
because
the
oklahoma
statute
cannot
apply
to
a
discharge
in
arkansas.
epa
is
not
applying
an
oklahoma
statute.
epa
is
applying
water
quality
standards
that
epa
approved
that
are
reflected
in
oklahoma
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
appear
in
an
oklahoma
statute,
and
oklahoma
can
apply
that
statute
within
oklahoma.
but
what
epa
is
applying
is
not
oklahoma
law.
that's
the
fundamental
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
here.
the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--exactly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
based
on
what
oklahoma
said
was
a
misapplication
of
applicable
water
quality
standards
that
the
clean
water
act
required
the
permitting
authority
to
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
those
water
quality
standards
appear
in
the
oklahoma
law.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct.
but
when
they're
being
enforced
in
the
permitting
process,
under
the
clean
water
act,
they
are
not
being
enforced
as
oklahoma
law
because
the
court
has
already
held
that
oklahoma
cannot
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
subject
to
review,
as
to
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
standards
that
the
epa
was
required
to
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
absolutely,
just
as
with
any
other
standard
that
epa
had
to
apply
in
the
permitting
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
under
the
statute,
if
the
downstream
state
is
unhappy
with
the
upstream
state's
issuance
of
the
permit,
its
right
is
to
complain
to
epa,
and
epa
has
the
authority
to
veto
that
permit
if
epa
concludes
that
applicable
water
quality
standards
would
be
violated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
epa
has
to
make
a
determination.
epa
ultimately
is
the
one
who
decides
in
these
interstate
disputes,
whether
the
applicable
water
quality
standards
will
be
met.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
let
me
check
that.
it
would
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
exactly
where
the
requirement
comes
in.
and
that
is
the
language
we
quote
in
our
brief,
the
very
language
that
you
quoted,
that
the
permitting
agency
is
to
assure
that
all
applicable
water
quality
requirements
are
to
be
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
oullette
can
be
read
consistently
with
this,
if
we
understand
what
this
recommendation
means.
it
really
is
a
submission
about
what
is
the
applicable
water
quality
standard,
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
standard
that
the
permitting
agency
is
required
to
apply.
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
that
is
our
reading,
that
the
water
standard
is
enforceable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
oullette
is
read
that
way,
we
think
that's
the
wrong
reading
of
oullette.
oullette
says
that
the
downstream
state
plays
a
subsidiary
role
in
the
process
to
the
source
state
and
the
epa.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
difference
between
arkansas
and
ourselves
xxx
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
the
anti-degradation
provision
that
was
specifically
at
issue,
and
that
was
interpreted
by
epa
by
the
chief
judicial
officer
as
being
satisfied
if
none
of
the
specific
parameters
of
water
quality
set
forth
elsewhere
in
the
water
quality
standards
would
be
affected
in
any
detectable
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
except
under
conditions
described
in
section
3
that...
this
was
interpreted
by
epa
which
approved
this
as
the
water
quality
standard,
as
not
meaning
that
any
detectable
discharge
is
prohibited,
but
meaning
that
any
detectable
impact
on
any
of
the
water
quality
parameters
set
forth
in
describing
the
quality
standards
for
oklahoma
waters
would
be
violated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
insofar
as
to
goes.
but
when
we're
dealing
with
a
new
point
source
discharge
39
miles
from
the
oklahoma
border,
it
must
be
remembered
that
oklahoma
has
no
authority
to
prohibit
a
point
discharge
in
arkansas.
the
only
discharge
in
oklahoma
is
what
ever
effect
appears
at
the
boarder
where
the
river
reaches
the
border
of
oklahoma.
and
so
from
the
standpoint
of
applying
the
oklahoma
in
the
interstate
context,
we're
looking
at
what
is
detectable
where
there
is
what
amounts
to
a
discharge
into
oklahoma
by
having
the
river
flow
into
oklahoma.
now,
i
just
want
to
say
very
briefly
before
reserving
the
balance
of
my
time,
that
this
is
a
very...
a
case
of
very
practical
significance.
there
are
64,000
point
source
permits
outstanding,
which
by
statute
are
limited
to
5-year
terms.
so
some
12,000
per
year
come
up
for
renewal.
many
of
the
water
quality
standards,
and
each
state
has
various
water
quality
standards
and
classifies
waters
in
various
ways,
are
stated
in
narrative
form
rather
than
in
numeric
form,
particularly
the
ones
about
aesthetics...
taste,
color,
odor,
and
other
aesthetic
standards,
as
well
as
the
anti-degradation
policies.
all
of
these
could
be
subject
to
second-guessing
in
judicial
review
proceedings
in
which
a
court
would
say
that,
well,
whether
epa's
interpretation
was
reasonable
or
not,
it
got
this
particular
state's
law
wrong.
and
what
this
state's
law
means
is
x.
now,
a
state
can
be
as
idiosyncratic
or
quixotic
as
it
wants
to
be
within
constitutional
limitations
in
apply
its
law
within
the
state,
but
it
would
frustrate
the
processes
of
the
federal
statute
to
have
this
unpredictability.
and
the
court
in
oullette
emphasized
that
predictability
was
the
hallmark
of
the
permit
system.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
496
of
the
case,
and
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
