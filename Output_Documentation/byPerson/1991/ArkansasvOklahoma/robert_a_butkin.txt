mr.
robert
a.
butkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today,
my
state,
oklahoma,
asks
you
to
recognize
the
special
protection
the
federal
law
provides
for
very
special
living
creatures
called
outstanding
national
resource
waters.
the
one
that's
been
presented
to
you
in
this
case
involves
the
scenic
illinois
river,
which
enters
the
state
of
oklahoma
from
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
courses
about
60
miles
in
a
southerly
direction
to
lake
tenkiller.
oklahoma
has
designated
its
portion
of
the
river
an
outstanding
national
resource
water,
pursuant
to
the
clean
water
act.
we
sent
that
designation
up
to
washington,
and
the
epa
approved
it
and
approved
our
water
quality
standard
for
that
river
as
federal
law.
and
our
water
quality
for
that
river
said
no
degradation,
no
discharge
can
be
permitted
into
that
river.
and
once
approved,
pursuant
to
the
clean
water
act,
that
ceased
to
be
only
state
law;
that
became
federal
law,
enforceable
under
the
clear
wording
of
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
no,
justice,
we
take--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--we
think
oullette
dealt
with
a
different
issue,
the
application
of
state
law,
state
common
law,
to
an
out-of-state
discharger,
and
oullette
recognized
that
the
clean
water
act
prohibited
downstream
state
law.
oullette
did
not
squarely
face
the
issue
of
how
federally
approved
water
quality
standards
of
the
state
should
be
enforced
in
a
permit
proceeding.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
we
would
request
the
court
recognize
that
oullette
was
limited
to
the
narrow
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
first
sentence
of
its...
of
the
opinion
in
that
court.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
we
think
that
epa
has
an
absolute
obligation
to
enforce
federally
approved
water
quality
standards.
the
statute
works
in
a
slightly
different
way
with
source
states
and
downstream
states.
source
states
do
have
an
absolute
veto
power
over
a
federal
permit.
downstream
states
do
not
have
a
veto
power,
but
if
their
federally
approved
water...
their
water
quality
standards
have
been
approved
by
the
epa,
those
standards
become
enforceable
under
the
clear
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
justice,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
oklahoma
would
disagree
with
that.
510
is
a
savings
clause
only
that
says
nothing
about
the
creation
of
federally
approved
water
quality
standards.
section
303
is
the
operative
provision
in
this
case.
and
under
section
303,
oklahoma
sends
up
its
proposed
or
adopted
standards
that
must
meet
minimum
federal
requirements.
the
epa
reviews
them,
and
if
they
find
the
standard
consistent
with
the
act,
the
epa
approves
them.
if
they
have
some
concern,
the
epa
sends
it
back
and
says
change
this,
change
that.
once
approved,
pursuant
to
section
303,
those
standards
cease
to
be
state
law
only,
and
they
become
federal
law.
and
the
reason
is
very--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--justice,
i
think
congress
made
the
tough
call.
i
don't
think
epa
can
say
it's
too
tough
because
i
think
the
whole
statutory
scheme
focuses
or
contemplates
on
these
federally
approved
water
quality
standards
being
enforced
to
avoid
a
situation
where
state
boundaries
serve
as
artificial
barriers
to
the
achievement
of
the
state's
goals.
as
epa
below
recognized,
and
they
told
us,
that
if
arkansas'
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
adopted,
you'd
have
a
situation
where
water
quality
would
be
set
by
the
lowest
common
denominator.
the
downstream
states
would
invariably
be
frustrated
in
their
efforts
to
achieve
their
goals--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
right.
and
that
gets
us
to
our
next
issue.
in
this
case,
there
are
no
degradations
of
standard
was
not
a
higher
standard.
we
modeled
it
after
the
federal
model.
the
federal
government
requires
each
state
as
part
of
the
federal
program,
as
part
of
their
water
quality
standards
to
send
up
a
anti-degradation
standard.
and
it
says,
states,
when
you
decide
that
rivers
are
so
important
to
you
that
they
should
be
considered
outstanding
national
resource
waters,
you
must
require
no
degradation
of
such
a
water.
we
sent
that
up
for
the
illinois
river,
and
they
approved
it.
epa
had
previously
told
us
how
under
federal
law
that
standard
should
be
interpreted.
in
1979,
the
epa
said
when
you
have
an
outstanding
national
resource
water,
you
don't
let
any
more
discharges
into
such
a
water.
you
don't--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--yes,
if
those
pollutants
enter
our
state.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
if
there's
no
finding
of
a
fact
below
that
the
pollutants
in
fact
stream
across
the
state
border,
there'd
be
no
problem.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
no,
justice,
they
made
a
finding...
i'm
sorry.
they
made
a
finding
that
for
every
100
pounds
of
phosphorous
sent
towards
oklahoma,
25
percent
would
reach
the
state
of
oklahoma,
a
finding
of
fact
not
contradicted
by
any
party.
they
made
a
finding
that
phosphorous
in
this
particular
river
system--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--federally
approved
water
quality
standards,
because--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
the
permit
must
be
prohibited
in
this
case
if
any
new
discharge
reaches
the
river.
it
depends
on
the--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--reaches
oklahoma,
i'm
sorry,
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
if
no
measurable
amount
of
pollutants,
in
this
case,
reached
oklahoma.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
finding
that
in
fact
measurable
amounts
did
reach
oklahoma.
the
administrative
law
judge
applied
a
test
in
this
case,
justices,
that
was
totally
consistent
with
how
this
same
federal
standard
has
been
interpreted.
and
if
i
may,
as
early
as
1979,
the
general
counsel
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
say
for
a
federally
protected
outstanding
national
river,
like
the
illinois,
for
federal
law
purposes,
we
do
not
permit
any
new
pollutant
load.
we
don't
permit
any
more
waste
to
enter
such
a
river.
we
don't
worry
about
the
impact
of
this
or
that.
we...
it's
a
given
when
you
add
new
pollutants
to
that
river,
you're
degrading
that
river.
there's
a
town
called
tahlequah,
oklahoma,
it's
about
3
miles
west
of
the
illinois
river...
same
river,
same
water
quality
standard.
it
discharges
its
waste
through
a
tributary,
not
directly
into
the
river,
through
a
tributary
that
reaches
the
river.
epa
in
1986
said
to
oklahoma,
if
you
increase
the
pollutant
load
to
that
river,
if
you
add
more
phosphorous
to
that
same
river,
you
are
violating
that
federal
water
quality
standard.
and
oklahoma
agreed
because
there
was
an
uncertainty
about
whether
they
entered
the
protected
part
of
the
river.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
no,
303.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
congress,
we
feel,
addressed
that
and
said
in
301(b)(1)(c),
you
must
enforce
all
applicable
water
quality
standards
with
no
room
for
a
balancing
test.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
the
other
states
do
have
something
to
say
about
it
because
the
law
requires
that
arkansas
and
upstream
states
be
permitted
an
opportunity
to
appear
at
our
rulemaking
proceedings
in
the
development
of
these
standards.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
but
remember
the--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--but
remember,
the
entire
thrust
of
the
statute
is
clean
our
waters.
and
we
had
a
system--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
no,
oklahoma
has
its
own
scenic
rivers
commissions
that
have
inventoried
the
rivers
and
picked
five
truly
outstanding
rivers
in
the
state
to
so
designate.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
by
that...
by
epa,
no.
however
the
department
of
interior
has
designated
the
river
since
1967
as
a
potential
national
scenic
river.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
well,
the
upstream
state
can
make
its
wishes
known
to
oklahoma
during
the--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--and
i
would
presume
that
they--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--the
upstream
state
can
make
its
wishes
known
to
the
downstream
state.
and
i
would
presume
the
upstream
states
and
all
states
can
make
their
wishes
known
to
epa,
also.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
not
until
they
approve
the
standard
as
a
for
the
no
degradation
policy.
but
epa
requires--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
in
terms
of
the
development
of
the
water
quality
standards--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--no,
the
designation
of
the
river,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
but
remember,
epa,
the
statutory
scheme
and
regulatory
scheme
requires
us
to
so
designate
these
rivers.
we
must
inventory
our
rivers.
we
must
designate
outstanding
rivers,
and
once
those
are
approved--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
the
epa
issued
this
permit
because
they
found
there
were
no
impacts
other
than
the
crossing
of
the
pollutants
into
the
river.
we
think
there
is
an
internal
contradiction
in
that
finding
because
the
epa
also
made
a
finding
that
phosphorous
controlled
algae
growth
in
this
particular
river.
we
think
it's
important
the
federal
law,
though,
be
applied
consistently.
and
here
epa
below
did
not
construe
any
authority
to--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--justice,
i
think
they
were
turning...
i
think
they
meant
something
other
than
the
phosphorous
coming
in...
a
nuisance,
a
harm
to
a
particular
use,
bass
fishery,
recreation,
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
right.
and
we
think
they
made
a
big
mistake
for
two
reasons.
one
is
they--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--i
do,
however,
i
think
the
plain
meaning--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--i'm
not
sure.
if
i
can
back
on
my
previous
answer,
the
statute
sets
up
a
partnership
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
it's
not
clear
in
the
statute
to
whom
you
defer.
our
feeling
in
this
case,
justice,
is
that
you
don't
have
decide
in
this
case
who
the
senior
partner
is
in
that
partnership,
because
no
matter
who
you
defer
to,
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
epa
has
consistently
interpreted
this
same
standard
to
mean
no
new
pollutant
discharge
can
reach
this
river...
as
recently
as
year
before
this
very
hearing.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
but
they
applied
an
entirely
different
test.
the
test
they'd
always
applied
previously
was--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
i
think
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
totally
abandon
your
prior
interpretations,
including
the
prior
interpretation
you
gave
a
year
previously
to
a
similar
discharger
in
oklahoma.
and
the
chief
judicial
officer
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
construing
his
authority
below
said
we
do
not
have
any
authority
to
balance
the
interests
of
oklahoma
and
arkansas.
we
do
not
have
any
authority
to
soften
this
standard,
or
apply
it
differently
to
an
oklahoma
discharger
as
opposed
to
an
arkansas
discharger.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
absolutely.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
absolutely.
and
consistent
with
our
own--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--phosphorous
is
a
pollutant
which
creates
more
algae
in
a
river.
and
there
was
also
a
finding
in
this
case
that
phosphorous
was
the
controlling
element
in
this
particular
river
system.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
it
causes
algae...
algae
destroys...
it
depletes
oxygen
and
contaminates
rivers.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
no,
it
was
not.
the
tahlequah
discharged,
or
went
into
a
tributary.
today,
the
solicitor
general
attempts
to
make
a
distinction
based
on
tributaries
and
says,
you
know
that's
the
rule
that
presumably
would
have
been
implied
if
the
standards
were
enforces.
but
we
know
darn
well
that
in
1986,
epa
said,
same
river,
discharge
comes
in
through
a
tributary.
if
it
increases
the
amount
of
phosphorous
in
that
river,
that's
a
violation
of
the
standard.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
the
discharge
was
in
the
tributary,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
exactly.
same
situation.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
i
think
a
pound
of
phosphorous
anywhere
is
harmful.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
not
necessarily.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
no.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
the
critical
finding--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--it
tells
you
enough
because
it's
been...
phosphorous
has
been
recognized
as
a
pollutant,
one
of
the
most
serious
pollutants.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
there
was
no
finding
on
that.
and
if
it
made
it
cleaner--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--yes,
but
i
would
caution
if
that
were
true
in
this
case,
why
wouldn't
arkansas
want
it
all?
it
would
be
the
same
ratio
if
it
were
100
percent
of
the
effluent,
the
same
concentration.
arkansas
deliberately
decided
to
ship
half
of
the
entire
effluent
flow
from
fayetteville
to
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
there's
no
finding,
and
i
think,
you
know,
in
the
tahlequah
situation
it
was
the
increased
load
in
and
of
itself.
epa's
always,
until
this
case,
interpreted
the
standard
to
mean
you
just
don't
add
any
pollutant
load,
pounds
of
pollutants.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
and
that's--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--our
federally
approved
standards
are
equal...
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
are
equally
applicable
to
all
oklahoma
discharges.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
yes,
if
they
violate
our
standard
of
the
state
law.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
because
the...
as
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
tenth
circuit
found
below,
if
that
something
allowed
in
the
other
state
crosses
the
oklahoma
state
line,
we're
not
talking
about
viclations
of
state
law,
we
talking
about
violations
of
federal
law.
the
statute
very
clearly
says
that
the
administrator
must
condition
a
permit
to
require
compliance
with
all
water
quality...
federally
approved
water
quality
standards,
including
downstream
states.
and
any
other
result
would,
we
feel,
and
the
epa
felt
and
the
tenth
circuit
felt,
totally
destroy
the
statutory
framework
which
focuses
on
clean
water.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
if
it's
not
a
point
source
discharge,
we
would
deal
through
it
not
with
the
permit
process,
but
with
the
separate
part
of
the
program
that
deals
with
nonpoint
sources.
and
oklahoma
and
arkansas
recently
received
a
grant
to
address
that
problem
as
well
in
the
same
river.
but
i'd
urge
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
statute
deals...
the
part
of
the
statute
we're
dealing
with
here
is--
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
--not
through
a...
possibly
through
a
common
law
nuisance
suit
under
arkansas
law.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
justices,
in
addition
to...
it
is
true
that
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own,
but
i
also
feel
it's
important
that
epa
be
consistent
with
its
interpretations
of
its
standards.
and
epa
did
depart
very
dramatically
from
the
interpretations
it
has
provided
for
and
since
for
this
same
standard,
which
says
no
degradation
means
no
new
pollutant
mode
can
enter
that
river.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
position
taken
by
the
agency
below
totally
destroyed
the
very
purpose
and
structure
of
the
anti-degradation
policy.
the
anti-degradation
policy
is
built
upon
three
levels,
and
at
the
bottom
of
those
levels,
the
critical
factor
is
to
protect
a
use
of
a
river...
a
use
for
bass,
a
use
for
recreation,
and
so
forth.
at
the
top
of
the
protection,
you
provide
no
degradation
for
outstanding
national
resource
waters.
what
the
epa
did
in
this
case
is
they
said,
we'll
let
more
and
more
and
more
pollutants
in
until
we
see
a
sign
of
a
loss
of
use,
until
we
see
a
sign
of
a
loss
of
some
other
protected
standard
for
the
river.
and
what
they
did
was
they
basically
collapsed
that
top-tier
protection
mandated
by
federal
law
for
this
highest
of
protected
rivers.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
they
can
obtain
a
permit
that
will
not
violate
our
water
quality
standards.
in
the
record
in
this
case,
there
were
two
alternatives
available
to
fayetteville
that
would
not
have
hurt
any
state's
water
quality
standards.
one
of
them
was
land
treatment.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
for
a
river
with
this
protection,
if
the
phosphorous
reached
the
oklahoma
state
line.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
right.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
that's
right.
and
it's
a
federal
program.
the
federal
program
is
designed
to
set
water
quality
standards
at
the
highest
when
the
lowest
common
denominator.
301(b)(1)(c),
you
cannot
issue
a
permit
unless
a
permit
applicant
can
achieve
any
more
stringent
or
protective
requirement
required
to
implement
any
applicable
water
quality
standard
established
pursuant
to
this
chapter.
any
applicable
water
quality
standard.
and
those
would
be
the
standards,
of
course,
of
all
states
that
might
be
impacted
by
a
discharge.
and
the
contrary
ruling
would
be
tremendously
detrimental
to
the
purposes
of
the
program.
you'd
have
a
situation...
as
epa
said
consistently
below,
you'd
have
a
program
where
polluters
would
locate
just
across
the
state
line
and
dump
into
interstate
rivers
and
pollute
the
downstream
states.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
we
think
not
because
402
requires
compliance
with
section
301;
301
requires
compliance
with
all
federally
approved
water
quality
standards.
those
are,
by
definition,
the
standards
approved
through
section
303.
mr.
robert
a.
butkin
just
as
in
the
clean
water
act,
the
congress,
working
with
the
epa,
created
a
one-way
street
working
entirely
towards
cleaner
water.
a
clean
water
standard
is
a
standard
to
improve
the
quality
of
water,
a
designated
use
is
a
use
be
achieved
through
the
applicable
water
quality
requirements.
while
the
solicitor
general
is
not
asking
you
to
affirm
the
key
ruling
in
the
tenth
circuit,
that
downstream
federally
approved
water
quality
standards
must
be
enforced
and
applied
in
proceedings,
we
ask
you
to
affirm
that,
as
epa
below
said
that
was
critical
to
the
functioning
and
survival
of
the
clean
water
act
program.
in
this
case,
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
properly
recognized
that
the
administrative
law
judge
had
permitted
fayetteville
a
wrong
turn
down
that
one-way
street,
and
we
ask
that
the
tenth
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
