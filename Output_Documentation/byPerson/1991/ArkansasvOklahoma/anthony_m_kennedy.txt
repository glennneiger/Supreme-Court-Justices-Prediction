justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
what
point
could
a
court
review,
if
at
all,
the
adequacy
and
the
correctness
of
epa's
interpretation
of
what
the
state
standard
meant?
when
you
first
approved
the
implementation
of
the
standard,
or
at
the
permit
stage,
such
as
we
have
here,
or
both?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
ever
review
your
parsing
of
oklahoma's
anti-degradation
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
that's
usually
for
substantial
evidence.
but
what
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
about
your
interpretation
and
understanding
of
the
oklahoma
statute.
is
that
subject
to
any
review
in
the
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
under
the
permit
procedure
you
were
required
to,
i
take
it,
evaluate
the
recommendations
made
by
oklahoma.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
were
based
on
oklahoma's
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
oklahoma
law
must
be
referred
to
in
order
to
understand
the
meaning
of
those
water
quality
standards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
from
a
legal
standpoint,
your
interpretation
of
that
law
is
never
subject
to
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
chevron
deference
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
view,
would
the
epa
have
had
discretion
to
completely
reject
the
oklahoma
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
under
401,
to
ensure
compliance
with
applicable
water
quality...
quality
requirements.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
epa
for
oklahoma
was...
or
prohibition
for
oklahoma
was
for
a
source
that
was
being
discharged
directly
into
the
designated
river,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
discharge
was
into
the
tributary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
what
happened
here.
