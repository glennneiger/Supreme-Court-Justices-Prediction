mr.
wallace,
may
i
interrupt
you
and
ask
a
question
or
two?
here
the
epa
itself
was
issuing
the
permit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
you
claim
that
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
federal
government
can
have
deference
on
its
interpretation
of
the
source
state's
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't...
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
source
state's
requirements,
in
this
case,
oklahoma,
become
federal
law,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
the
source
state,
excuse
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
state
where
the
source
of
the
pollution
enters
the
water,
you
say
that
state's
laws
become
federal
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
oklahoma
take
the
position
that
its
no
degradation
policy
means
something
different
than
the
epa
says
it
means?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
as
to
that,
oklahoma
has
a
different
view
than
the
epa
as
to
what
those
standards
require.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
whose
law
do
we
apply?
