justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
butkin?
just
forgetting
the
specific
statutory
provisions
for
a
minute,
is
the
thrust
of
your
argument...
is
the
practical
effect
of
your
argument
mean
a
tributary
of
the
illinois
river
that
happens
to
be
located
in
arkansas
may
not
grant
a
new
permit
to
any
source
that
would
not
satisfy
the
standards
applicable
to
the
illinois
river?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
well...
if
those
pollutions
enter...
what
if
they
prove
they
don't
which
i
think
they
almost
did
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
they
made
a
finding
that
there
wa
no
detectable
pollutant
at
the
state
border,
that
would
be
enough--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
argument
about
the
facts.
i
just
want
to
understand
your
theory.
is
it
your
theory
that
at
the
point
at
which
the
river
crosses
the
state
line,
the
arkansas
tributary
must
conform
with
the
illinois
river
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
one...
no
degradation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
does
conform
with
that,
it
may...
the
permit
may
be
granted,
even
though
there's
a
lot
of
pollution
that
dissipates
on
the
way
to
the
state
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
but
as
long
as
none
of
it
reaches
oklahoma,
no
detectable
amount
reaches
oklahoma,
then
it
would
be
permitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
a
little
question
to
clear
up
my
confusion
on
the
phosphorous.
i
take
it
makes
a
difference
how
much
water
there
is
in
the
river.
in
other
words,
a
pound
of
phosphorous
in
the
mississippi
river
would
be
different
from
a
pound
of
phosphorous
in
the
illinois
river.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it?
if
the
ratio
of
phosphorous
to
water
in
the
water
crossing
state
line
is
less
that
the
ratio
of
phosphorous
to
water
in
the
oklahoma
part
of
the
river,
is
it
still
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
and
are
there
findings
on
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
all
you've
got
is
the
absolute
amount
of
phosphorous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
really
doesn't
tell
us
anything,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
if
the
ratio
of
phosphorous
is
even
smaller,
perhaps
this
discharge
is
actually
making
your
river
somewhat
cleaner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible;
isn't
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
reading
section
3
of
you
standards
about
the
anti-degradation
policy.
the
sentence:
no
further
quality...
water
quality
degradation
which
would
interfere
with,
and
so
forth,
shall
be
allowed...
this
is
an
oklahoma
command.
does
that
mean
shall
be
allowed
by
any
oklahoma
discharger,
anyone
subject
to
the
oklahoma?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
doesn't
actually
apply
to
discharges
in
arkansas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
but
not
to
discharges
in
arkansas
that
may
find
their
way
into
oklahoma.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
as
i
understand
you,
if
there's
any
phosphorous
at
all,
and
presumably
there's
always
going
to
be
a
little
bit
left,
they
can't
open
a
new
plant
and
they
can't
grant
a
new
permit.
i
don't
see
how
they
could
ever
grant
a
new
permit
under
your
rationale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
mean
they
couldn't
discharge
any...
it
could
not
make
a
discharge
into
the
river
that
would
have
an
phosphorous
in
it
whatsoever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
is
arkansas
against
oklahoma,
and
environmental
protection
agency
against
oklahoma,
it
is
actually
two
separate
cases
covered
in
one
opinion.
pursuant
to
the
clean
water
act,
the
environmental
protection
agency
issued
a
discharge
permit
to
a
new
sewage
treatment
plant
in
fayetteville,
arkansas.
under
the
permit,
the
plant
was
allowed
to
discharge
part
of
its
affluent
into
the
illinois
river
about
39
miles
upstream
from
the
arkansas-oklahoma
state
line.
in
support
of
the
permit,
the
epa
made
a
finding
that
discharges
from
the
plant
would
not
cause
a
detectable
violation
of
oklahoma's
water
quality
standards.
oklahoma
challenged
that
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
epa
had
erroneously
concluded
that
the
plant's
discharge
would
not
violate
the
oklahoma's
standards.
based
on
our
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
regulations
in
the
relevant
precedents,
we
conclude
that
epa's
application
and
interpretation
of
the
oklahoma
standard
was
proper,
and
that
the
epa's
issuance
of
the
fayetteville
permit
was
consistent
with
its
statutory
authority,
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
opinions
in
both
cases
i
have
announced
are
unanimous.
