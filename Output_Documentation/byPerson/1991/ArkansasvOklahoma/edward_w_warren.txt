mr.
edward
w.
warren
if
i
may
turn
very
first
off
to
justice
souter's
question
regarding
section
401(a)(2).
justice
souter,
the
governing
provision
here
for
resolving
interstate
disputes
is
section
403(b)(5)
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
section
402(b)(5)
is
found
on
page
168a,
169,
and
section
401(a)(2),
as
i
think
justice
souter
has
already
pointed
out,
is
on
page
166a.
one-sixty...
402(a)(3)
is
a
provision
left
over
from
the
1970
act
before
the
npdes
permit
program
was
enacted
in
1972.
its
purpose
then
and
now
was
to
deal
with
other
federal
licenses,
for
instance,
corps
of
engineers
permits,
ferc
application
for
construction.
i
think
you
can
see
that
by
reading
the
provision
which
has
the
anomaly
in
the
context
of
an
ep...
epa
npdes
permit
of
having
epa
recommending
to
itself.
the
governing
provision
are...
provisions
are
the
dispute
resolution
provisions
of
section
402(b)(5),
and
they
are
applicable
to
epa
permits
through
section
402(a)(3),
which
says,
the
common-sensical
outcome,
which
is
that
the
same
provisions,
the
same
principles
ought
to
govern
whether
the
permit
is
issued
by
the
state
or
whether
it
is
issued
by
epa.
under
the
402(b)(5)
process,
which
the
court
did
interpret
in
oullette,
epa
is
given
the
responsibility
for
resolving
these
interstate
disputes.
and
it
can
accept
the
recommendations
of
the
permitting
state,
the
source
state,
or
it
can
accept
the
recommendations
of
the
affected
state,
or
it
can
split
the
difference
in
any
way
it
chooses.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
souter,
what
you
say
would
be
true
if
epa
had
authority
to
disapprove
any
state
standard
as
being
too
stringent.
epa
has
no
power
to
disapprove
such
a
standard.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
you...
and
if
i
can
call
your
attention
to
page
25
of
my
brief,
where
we
cite
the
epa
official
pronouncement
on
this
in
the
federal
register
where
they
say
they
don't
have
any
authority
to
disapprove
a
state
standard
which
is
too
tough.
that's
also
the
holding
of
the
one
court
that's
reached
the
question
in
the
homestake
mining
case.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
excuse
me?
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor,
that's
precisely
the
thrust
of
section
510
of
the
statute.
section
510
allows
a
state
to
impose
more
stringent
requirements.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
that's
precisely
right.
those
state
standards,
even
after
being
approved,
remain
state
law.
what
we
need
and
what
we
have
in
section
402(b)(5)
is
a
mechanism
to
resolve
those
disputes.
epa
can
decide
whether
to
apply
or
how
much
to
apply
any
downstream
standard
in
the
process
of
writing
those
permits.
let
me
say
that
i
believe
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed
because
it
treated
the
oullette
decision
as
if
it
were
dictum.
the
oullette
decision
is
holding,
and
it
controls
the
outcome
of
this
case.
what
the
court
held
in
oullette,
and
said
in
unmistakable
terms,
is
that
the
downstream
state
has
only
and
advisory
role
in
regulating
pollution
which
originates
beyond
its
borders.
it
can
neither
block
a
source
state
permit,
nor
regulate
an
out
of
source...
directly.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
have
had
that
discretion
if
it
has
so
chosen.
but
its
charge
under
the
statute
is
to
protect
downstream
water
quality
and
to
do
what
is...
it
believes
in
its
judgment
is
appropriate
to
protect
downstream
water
quality.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
with
those
requirements
which
it
concludes
are
applicable
in
order
to
protect
downstream
water
quality.
let
me
say,
justice
souter,
my
reading
must
be
right,
or
else
oullette
would
not
be
right.
what
this
court
said
in
oullette
was
that
the
vermont
nuisance
remedies
in
that
case
were
preempted
because
vermont
could,
and
i'm
using
the
court's
words,
could
not
do
indirectly
by
nuisance
remedies
what
it
could
not
do
directly.
that
is
regulate
the
conduct
of
out-of-state
sources.
if
oklahoma
can
enact
a
no
discharge
standard,
as
it
has
done
here...
justice
souter
i
think
correctly
read
that
prohibition.
if
it
can
enact
a
no
discharge
prohibition
and
apply
it
to
an
arkansas
source,
then
it
is
doing
directly
through
the
statute
precisely
what
it...
the
court
said
it
couldn't
do
in
oullette.
and
indeed
the
very
reason
why
the
court
in
oullette
held
the
nuisance
remedies
were
preempted.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but,
first
of
all
the
state
standards
can't
be
disapproved,
as
i've
said.
secondly,
i
want
to
stress
that
401(a)(2)
is
a
provision
that
has
an
entirely
different
purpose
and
entirely
different
history,
and
402(a)(3)
makes
clear--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--it's
still
there,
but
it
has
an
application
in
this
different
context
with
corps
of
engineer
permits.
but
remember,
this
court
has
long
held
that
if
a
state...
and
that's
what
happening
here,
since
there's
no
disapproval
authority.
if
a
state
is
to
regulate
beyond
its
borders
to
control
sources
in
another
state,
there
must
be
unmistakably
clear
congressional
intent
to
authorize
that.
this
is
a
cardinal
principle
of
federalism.
we're
talking
about
whether
one
sovereign
state
can
regulate
another
sovereign
state.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
i
don't
think
you
would,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
is
found
in
section
510,
which
is
this
provision
in
the
statute
that
directly
applies
to
this
question.
that's
the
provision
that
preserves
for
the
states
their
authority
to
enact
more
stringent
requirements.
and
it
restricts
those
requirements
to
that
state's
waters
and
sources
in
that
state.
if
you
look
at
that
provision,
i
think
you'll
see
it
is
intended
to
preserve
the
sovereign
prerogative
that...
of
arkansas,
really,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here.
arkansas,
as
a
sovereign,
in
order
to
protect
its
waters,
and
in
order
to
do
what
it
wishes
to
do
with
its
waters,
needs
to
be
able
to
regulate
sources
in
arkansas.
and
those
requirements
of
arkansas
can't
be
trumped
by
what
is
state
law,
oklahoma
law
that
epa
cannot
disapprove.
what
this
court
addressed
in
oullette
is
the
proper
way
to
resolve
the
question,
and
i
would
submit
the
controlling
answer
to
the
question.
