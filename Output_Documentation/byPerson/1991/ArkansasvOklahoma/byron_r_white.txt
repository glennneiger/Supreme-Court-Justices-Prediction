justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
epa
approved
them,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
guess
it's
those
standards
are
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they're
still
oklahoma
law.
i
mean,
they
appear
in
an
oklahoma
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
also
could
be
enforced
by
oklahoma
in
oklahoma.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
in
the
statute,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
doesn't
this...
this
isn't
just
an
administrative
ruling.
doesn't
the
clean
water
act
permit...
itself
permit
the
states
to
have
stricter
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
the
extent
they
impose
more
stringent
requirements
and
the
epa
approves
their
standards,
i
don't
suppose
to
the
extent
that
it's
more
stringent
that
federal
standards,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
part
of
the
state
plan
is
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
want
to
know--
--reaches
oklahoma.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
how
come
the
epa
issued
this
permit?
because
they
found
there
wouldn't
be
any
measurable
degradation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
it
meant
by
no
detectable
or
measurable...
degradation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
purported
to
be
construing
your
standard,
which
is
federal
law.
they...
and
they
thought,
as
construed
by
them,
this
permit
should
issue
because
there
wasn't
any
harm
to
your
water.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
disagree
with
them
on
that
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
agree,
though,
that
they
have
the...
they
have
the
authority
to
construe
your
standard
as
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
wait
a
minute.
let's
just
assume...
let's
just
assume
that
the
way
they
construe
it
is
one
of
the
rational
ways
of
construing
it.
then
you
must
defer
to
them,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
this
case
they
said
that
your
water...
your
water
quality
standard
was
not
being
violated.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they...
in
this
case
they
construe
your
standard,
and
they
say
it's
not
being
violated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think...
so
how
do
we
review
that?
as
what,
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
they
utterly
ignored
in
making
this
ruling
the
fact
that
phosphorous
was
getting
into
your
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
state
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
phosphorous
do
for
you
or
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
does
algae
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
destroys...
and
eventually
it
destroys
the
fishery.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
how
can
oklahoma
issue
a
rule
that
says
something
shall
not
be
allowed
in
another
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
permit
wasn't
involved
here?
what
if
arkansas
people,
riparian
owners,
started
discharging
things
into
the
river.
and...
say
they
just
dump
phosphorous
in
the
river
and
it
reached
oklahoma.
what
could
you
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
haven't
answered
my...
could
oklahoma
do
anything
about
that
in
my--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
that's
about
it,
without
having
some
agreement
with
arkansas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
oullette
recognized
the
nuisance
action,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
question
of
whose
law
applies.
