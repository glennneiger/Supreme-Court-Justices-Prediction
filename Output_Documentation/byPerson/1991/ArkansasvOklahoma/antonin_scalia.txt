mr.
wallace,
that
makes
a
lot
sense
when
epa
happens
to
be
the
permitter,
as
is
the
case
here.
but
how
does
your
very
logical
scheme
work
when,
as
is
often
the
case,
it
is
the
upstream
state
that
is
the
permitter?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no
deference
to
the
upstream
permitter.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
subject
to
oullette,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
if
they've
been
approved
by
the
epa
as
though
the
epa
can
make
all
this
reasonable.
but
the
statute
prohibits
the
apa...
the
epa
from
making
all
this
reasonable
because
it
says
that
the
state
can...
in
section
510,
that
nothing
in
the
chapter
shall
preclude
the
right
of
a
state
to
adopt
or
enforce
any
standard
or
limitation
regarding
discharge
of
pollutants.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
you
combine
the
two
principles,
it
means
apa
must
approve
it
and
then
apa
must...
epa
must
enforce
it
against
another
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
butkin,
but
when
the
federal
government
designates
a
river
as
an
outstanding
national
river,
presumably
all
states
have
a
say
in
that.
but
when
oklahoma
chooses
to
do
so,
despite
other
states
upstream,
only
oklahoma
has
to
speak.
now
you
say
that
the
approval
is
under
section
133?
justice
antonin
scalia
303?
what
power
would
epa
have
when
oklahoma
comes
in
and
says
we
want
to
make
this
and
outstanding
national
river,
to
say
well,
gee,
you
know,
there
are
other
states
upstream
whose
people
are
using
this
water,
and
we
just
don't
think
it's
realistic
to
make
this
and
outstanding
national
river.
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
who
cares
what
anybody
up
river
thinks?
we're
our
own
state,
and
we're
going
to
make
this
and
outstanding
national
river,
and
nobody
upstream
can
use
it.
that's
what
congress
enacted.
with
nobody,
the
federal
government
and
the
other
states
having
nothing
to
say
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait...
in
oklahoma's
rulemaking
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
supplicants
to
oklahoma
saying
please
don't
make
this
an
outstanding
national
river
because
we
have
people
upstream
who
want
to
use
this
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
generous.
