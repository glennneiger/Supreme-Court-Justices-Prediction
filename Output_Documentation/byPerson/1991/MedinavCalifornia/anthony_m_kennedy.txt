well,
perhaps
if
you
say
defendant,
but
suppose
we
talk
about
the
defendant
and
the
defendant's
counsel,
the
defense
team.
the
defendant's
counsel
certainly
has
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
and
assess
the
condition
of
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant's
counsel
then
i
assume
has
the
opportunity
to
call
and
retain
experts
in
order
to
make
the
showing
that's
needed.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
critical
issue
i
take
it...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
is
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
cooperate
with
counsel
in
the
presentation
of
the
case.
justice
kennedy
is
that
the
ultimate
legal--
justice
kennedy
--who
would
know
that
better
than
the
attorney?
justice
kennedy
do
you
mean
by
that
that
at
the
end
of
the
40-some-odd
days
the
person
is
found
to
be
competent?
justice
kennedy
is
it
clear
both
in
this
case
and
in
the
classic
cases
that
we're
considering
that,
if
there
is
an
erroneous
determination
of
incompetence,
that
the
defendant
is
held
in
custody
until
there
is
a
second
hearing
on
the
issue?
justice
kennedy
and
what
about
this
particular
case?
justice
kennedy
counsel,
are
there
things
that
the
defendant's
counsel
is
just
inadequate
to
evaluate
when
he
suspects
that
there
may
be
a
mental
imbalance,
and
is
that
why
it
is
not
important
or
dispositive
in
your
view
that
the
defense
counsel
has
real
access
to
the
defendant?
is
your
point
that
we
need
a
battery
of
experts
to
do
this,
and
that
the
defense
attorney
isn't
really
that
much
help?
justice
kennedy
it's
probably
hard
for
you
to
generalize,
but
in
most
of
these
cases
are
there
standard
tests
that
medical
experts
testify
to?
is
that
the
way
the
competency
hearing
works?
justice
kennedy
observations
and
impressions
of
the
mental
condition
are
not
within
the
privilege?

the
first
case
is
medina
versus
california,
no.
90-8370.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
in
1984,
medina,
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
went
on
a
crime
spree
and
committed
several
robberies,
he
murdered
three
persons
and
was
tried
on
three
counts
of
first
degree
murder
as
well
as
a
number
of
lesser
offenses.
before
trial,
medina's
counsel
moved
for
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
he
was
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
under
the
california
penal
code
that
a
criminal
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
competent
and
that
medina
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
was
incompetent
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
jury
found
medina
competent
to
stand
trial
and
in
a
subsequent
trial
proceeding,
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
on
appeal,
medina
argues
that
the
penal
code
violated
his
right
to
due
process
by
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
him
to
establish
that
he
was
not
competent
to
stand
trial
and
by
establishing
the
presumption
that
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial
unless
proven
otherwise.
the
california
supreme
court
rejected
these
arguments.
we
granted
certiorari
in
a
decision
filed
today,
we
affirm.
as
an
initial
matter,
we
reject
medina's
argument
that
his
due
process
challenge
to
the
penal
code
should
be
analyzed
under
the
three-factor
balancing
test
set
forth
in
mathews
versus
eldridge.
in
our
view,
mathews
did
not
provide
the
appropriate
framework
for
assessing
the
validity
of
state
procedural
rules
which
like
the
one
at
bar
are
part
of
the
criminal
process.
in
the
field
of
criminal
law,
we
have
defined
the
category
of
due
process
violations
in
a
narrow
way.
the
bill
of
rights
speaks
in
explicit
terms
to
many
aspects
of
criminal
procedure.
expansion
of
those
constitutional
guarantees
under
the
open-ended
rubric
of
the
due
process
clause
invites
undue
interference
with
both
considered
legislative
judgments
and
the
careful
balance
of
the
constitution
strikes
between
liberty
and
order.
furthermore,
although
we
have
invoked
mathews
in
resolving
due
process
claims
in
two
criminal
law
cases,
the
united
states
versus
raddatz,
and
ake
versus
oklahoma,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
mathews
was
essential
to
the
results
reached
in
those
decisions.
in
our
view,
the
proper
analytic
approach
is
that
set
forth
in
patterson
versus
new
york.
in
patterson,
we
have
recognized
that
it
is
normally
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
procedures
under
which
its
criminal
laws
had
carried
out,
including
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
ad
burden
of
persuasion.
and
we
sated
that
the
state's
decision
in
this
regard
is
not
subject
to
prescription
under
the
due
process
clause
unless
it
offends
some
principle
of
justice
so
rooted
in
the
traditions
and
conscience
of
our
people
as
to
be
ranked
as
fundamental.
based
on
our
review
of
the
historical
treatment
the
burden
of
proof
in
competency
proceedings,
the
operation
of
the
challenge
rule,
and
our
precedents,
we
cannot
say
that
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
a
criminal
defendant
to
prove
incompetence
violates
a
recognized
principle
of
justice
that
can
be
deemed
fundamental.
with
regard
to
the
presumption
of
competence
imposed
by
the
california
penal
code,
we
seem
no
reason
to
distrub
the
california
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
in
essence
the
challenge
presumption
is
a
restatement
of
the
burden
of
proof.
in
light
of
our
determination
that
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant
does
not
violate
due
process,
it
follows
that
this
aspect
of
the
statute
also
withstands
scrutiny.
