chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
90-8370,
teofilo
medina
v.
california.
spectators
are
admonished,
do
not
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
pescetta,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pescetta,
you're
asking
us
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
presumably
then
the
california
courts
would
have
to
conduct
a
rehearing,
a
retrial,
at
least
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
now,
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
get
from
you
exactly
what
your
view
is
as
to
the
preponderance
in
order
that
we
may
decide
this
case.
to
send
it
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
say
well,
you
know,
the
preponderance
is
standard
in
favor...
let
the
state
prove
it,
is
the
very
least
that
the
constitution
requires.
that
is
not
going
to
help
the
california
courts
retry
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
also
the
maximum.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
we're
talking
about
the
united
states
constitution--
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
what,
the
fourth
amendment
now
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
sure
that
you're...
you
mentioned
nix
v.
williams,
which
i
think
is
fourth
amendment,
lego
against
twomey,
isn't
that
also
fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
you've
got
two
different
constitutional
provisions
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
wonder
if
you
are
justified.
i
mean,
there
aren't
just
two
constitutional
provisions,
as
you
and
i
both
know.
there
are
any
number
of
them.
you
know,
not
infinite,
but
15,
20,
something
like
that,
in
the
first
10
amendments
to
the
constitution.
you
are
now
citing
the
treatment
in
two
cases
and
saying
that
this
justifies
a
generalization.
i'm
not
sure
you're
correct.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
doesn't
the
history
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
it
of
how
that
burden
has
been
allocated
historically?
chief
justice
rehnquist
doesn't
that
suggest
that
perhaps
the
constitution
doesn't
speak
much
to
those
questions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
have
we
ever
applied
mathews
in
the
criminal
constitutional
law
field?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pescetta.
ms.
wilkens,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
suggesting
that
a
defendant
may
not
always
welcome
a
determination
of
incompetency.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why,
because
the...
don't
the
california
courts
treat...
if
a
defendant
takes...
if
a
defense
lawyer
takes
the
stand
and
testifies
as
to
some
aspects
of
competency,
isn't
the
privilege
waived
across
the
board,
or
do
they
say
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
that
has
not
been
resolved,
as
the
law
presently
stands
in
california.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
did
that
reaffirmation
occur?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
wilkens.
mr.
pescetta,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pescetta.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
