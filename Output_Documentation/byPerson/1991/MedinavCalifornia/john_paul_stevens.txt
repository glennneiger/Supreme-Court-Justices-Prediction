justice
stevens
of
course,
their
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
you
don't
really
lose
the
right;
you
merely
delay
its
assertion
for
whatever
time
it
takes
to
have
a
more
accurate
competency
determination
after
he's
in
the
institution
for
a
while.
justice
stevens
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
his
43-day
figure
really
should
be
90
days
or
120
days.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
supposing
in
the
institution
the
people
in
the
institution
think
this
fellow
is
malingering
and
he's
really
perfectly
competent.
is
there
any
procedure
by
which
they
can
bring
that
fact
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
do
they
have
to
wait
the
2
years,
in
other
words?
justice
stevens
no,
but
isn't
there
this
different.
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
procedure,
but
isn't
it
different
that
if
he's
been
committed
to
an
institution
where
he's
under
24-hour-a-day
custody
and
supervision
by
experts
in
mental
health,
they
have
one
body
of
facts
to
work
with,
whereas
if
he
has
not
had
a
hearing
at
all,
isn't
he
in
a
normal
jail,
or
he's
not
necessarily
in
a
mental
institution
when
the
issue
arises.
so
you
don't...
the
state
has
had
a
different
amount
of
access
to
the
relevant
facts
at
the
second
hearing
than
it
would
have
at
the
first
hearing.
justice
stevens
--what
it
boils
down
to,
as
i
understand
it,
you
take
the
position
that
if
the
judge
doesn't
know,
he
just
can't
tell
whether
this
man
is
competent
or
not,
then
he
should
make
him
stand
trial.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
no,
but
it
would
be
the
same,
i
suppose,
if
they
had
a
hung
jury
and
they
deliberated
for
14
days
and
they
said
we
really
can't
tell,
we
can't
return
a
verdict.
that
would
still
require
that
he'd
have
to
go
to
trial,
then.
justice
stevens
oh,
you
do.
justice
stevens
on
that
point,
has
that
been
decided
in
california,
or
are
you
just
saying
that's
the
position
you
would
take?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
as
a
general
rule
counsel
often
could
testify
about
demeanor
and
tone
of
voice
and
things
like
that
without
necessarily
violating
the
privilege.
i
mean,
i'm
not...
i'm
just
not
sure
you--
