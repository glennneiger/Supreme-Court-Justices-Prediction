ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
california's
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
moving
party
in
a
competency
determination
offends
no
principle
of
justice
which
is
so
rooted
in
our
traditions
and
conscience
to
be
ranked
as
fundamental.
additionally,
the
california
procedure
is
in
accord
with
the
federal
government,
which
provides
similarly
in
a
statute
which
was
amended
in
1984.
additionally,
of
the
14
legislatures
of
states
which
have
specifically
addressed
the
allocation
of
a
burden
of
proof,
11
of
the
14
comport
with
california
law.
moreover,
the
competency
determination
is
unique
in
that
it
can
be
raised
by
the
defense,
by
the
prosecution,
or
sua
sponte
by
the
court.
so
accordingly
it
is
important
to
recall
that
there
may
be
defendants
who
are
not
resisting
a
competency
determination
but
nevertheless
are
subject
to
the
litigation
which
may
ultimately
lead
to
their
confinement
without
any
determination
of
guilt.
there
may
be
defendants
with
strong
defenses
to
criminal
charges
who
are
precluded
from
making
those
defenses
because
of
an
incompetency
determination.
additionally,
petitioner--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--indeed,
and
that
has
been
the
case
in
some
instances.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
united
states
v.
hemsi
out
of
the
second
circuit,
a
1990
case
at
901
fed
2d
293,
which
illustrates
this
point.
in
that
particular
prosecution
it
was
the
government
who
initiated
the
incompetent
proceeding.
the
defense
counsel
took
the
stand
and
testified
in
favor
of
a
competency
finding,
and
ultimately
it
was
appealed
to
the
second
circuit,
the
incompetency
determination.
so
we
cannot
assume
that
each
and
every
defendant
is
seeking
the
incompetency
determination.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
your
honor,
admittedly
that
is
a
conceivable
solution,
but
i
can
only
emphasize
that--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--it's
not
incumbent
upon
california
to
adopt
such
a
procedure.
the
petitioner
has
ignored
california's
right
to
bring
a
defendant
to
trial.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
right
to
bring
a
criminal
defendant
to
trial
is
fundamental
to
a
scheme
of
ordered
liberty
and
to
social
justice
and
peace,
and--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--yes.
the
only
thing
petitioner
will
concede
is
that
there
would
be
some
delay.
but
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
delay,
because
in
reading
petitioner's
brief
there
are
references
to
the
majority
being
returned
immediately
and
the
rest
being
returned
quickly,
and
there
are
studies
referencing
averages
of
43
days.
and
counsel
this
morning
has
indicated
that
the
california
penal
code
provides
for
a
report
within
15
days.
so
he's
talking
days,
and
i
don't
think
that's
appropriate.
the
penal
code
section
counsel
refers
to
section
1370,
subsection
(a)(2).
that
provides
for
a
report
in
15
days
to
the
trial
court
as
to
whether
defendant
will
go
to
an
outpatient
program
or
be
committed
to
a
mental
institution.
it's
not
a
determination
as
to
competency
at
15
days.
the
california
law
provides
for
a
90-day
period
for
the
initial
diagnostic
evaluation.
the
federal
provision,
which
is
the
same,
provides
for
a
4-month
commitment
to
a
mental
institution,
so
we're
not
talking
days.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
no,
his
15-day
figure
should
be
90
days
or
4
months.
now,
with
respect
to
his
43-day
figure,
i
have
some
problems
with
that
as
well.
the
one
study
which
counsel
cites
relating
to
california
relates
to
atascadero,
which
is
but
one
of
california's
mental
hospitals,
but
that
particular
study
references
the
majority
of
incompetent
defendants
being
returned
in
a
little
over
3
months.
now,
that
is
just
one
study,
and
the
california
law
provides
for
a
full
competency
hearing
again
at
18
months
in
the
event
that
someone
is
still
committed
and
has
not
yet
been
certified
mentally
competent.
and
the
legislature
selected
18
months
for
a
reason,
and
in
the
pacific
law
journal,
volume
6,
at
page
492,
at
footnote
67,
they
cite
california
department
of
health
records
relating
to
all
commitments
pursuant
to
penal
code
section
1370,
and
those
records
indicate
that
the
majority
of
defendants
are
returned
within
2
years,
and
this
is
a
significant
difference.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
absolutely
not.
if
at
any
time
at
the
mental
health
facility
the
experts
arrive
at
an
opinion
that
the
individual
is
indeed
competent,
he
is
returned
to
court
at
that
time.
but
again
it's
important
to
note
that
the
california
procedures
provide
for
expert
evaluations
prior
to
the
hearing
on
this
matter.
so
if
an
individual
is
particularly
adept
at
fooling
the
experts
in
that
context,
there's
no
reason
to
suggest
that
he
will
be
returned
immediately,
based
on
the
evaluations
in
the
hospital
setting.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that's
correct.
he
may
not
even
be
in
custody
prior
to
the
hearing
on
mental
competency.
so
with
respect
to
delay,
there
is
a
significant
difference,
however,
and
the
state
does
have
a
concern
with
respect
to
malingering,
because
as
the
expert
testimony
below
from
petitioner's
own
expert
indicates,
avoiding
the
death
penalty
is
a
motivation
for
malingering.
and
counsel
has
indicated
that
there
will
be
little
litigation
on
the
issue
of
mental
competency,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
will
come
in
the
cases
that
california
has
the
greatest
interest.
that
is,
the
more
serious
the
offense
the
greater
the
motivation
to
malinger,
and
this
is
something
that
has
been
recognized
historically
since
1847
when
hale
observed
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
empanel
a
jury
to
see
if
a
claim
of
madness
is
real
or
fraudulent.
so
with
respect
to
the
state's
interest,
it
is
enhanced
in
the
sense
that
the
delay
is
putting
these
people
back
into
the
system
at
the
initial
point.
it
is
in
all
probability
the
most
serious
of
offenders
and
those
of
the
greatest
concern
to
the
state.
additionally,
as
this
case
serves
to
illustrate,
california
has
a
strong
interest
in
not
having
individuals
in
a
hospital
setting,
other
than
those
who
are
truly
deserving
of
the
evaluation,
because
as
the
experts
again
agreed
in
their
testimony,
there
are
individuals,
career
criminals,
very
serious,
dangerous
individuals,
who
will
seek
out
a
hospital
setting
because
it
is
less
secure
and
they
are
more
likely
to
perfect
an
escape.
so
there
is
attendant
risk
to
the
state
both
in
delay
to
the
strength
of
the
prosecution's
case
and
with
respect
to
facilitating
the
incarceration
of
serious
offenders
in
a
hospital
setting.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i'm
not
very
familiar
with
the
federal
study.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is,
and
again
i'm
not
suggesting
we
don't
have
very
secure
facilities.
however,
there
is,
of
course,
limited
space
in
all
of
our
institutions,
both
mental
and
otherwise,
and
we
have
different
classifications
for
different
inmates.
so
if
we
have
a
large
percentage
of
our
most
dangerous,
most
serious
offenders
being
placed
into
a
hospital
setting,
the
burdens
increase
with
respect
to
protecting
the
safety
of
the
public.
and
additionally,
as
the
record
indicates
here,
there
was
an
escape
attempt
by
this
very
defendant
from
an
arizona
hospital
prior
to
his
incarceration
in
california.
with
respect
to
access,
i
would
indicate
that
theoretically
there
is
equal
access
with
respect
to
psychiatric
evaluation.
however,
given
the
vagaries
of
psychiatry
and
the
core
issue,
which
is
the
ability
to
communicate
with
counsel
and
to
understand
the
proceedings,
the
defense
counsel
truly
has
superior
access
to
the
defendant
himself.
and
additionally
there
is
no
obligation
for
a
criminal
defense
attorney
to
facilitate
the
prosecution
by
providing
specific
instances
in
his
knowledge
that
would
evidence
competence,
and
the
entire
scheme
of
california
is
focused
on
the
defense
attorney.
now,
this
morning,
counsel
suggested--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--i
would
hesitate
to
characterize
it
as
customary
for
the
defense
attorney
to
take
the
stand.
they
have,
indeed,
been
called
to
testify.
that
would
not
be
unprecedented,
and
the
law
as
it
stands
today
provides
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
not
implicated
when
counsel
testifies
to
demeanor,
which
is
unrelated
to
confidences
relating
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
and
for
example,
petitioner
suggested
that
the
defense
investigator
testified,
and
he
indicated
that
in
his
conversations
with
the
defendant
he
wanted
to
talk
of
irrelevant
subjects,
and
he
was
able
to
discuss
what
those
irrelevant
subjects
were.
the
difficulty
is
that
perhaps
embodied
in
those
discussions
with
the
defense
team
are
very
strong
indications
of
competency.
the
prosecution
is
not
entitled
to
inquire
as
to
the
specifics
of
what
communications
have
taken
place
within
that
attorney-client
privilege,
and
so
while
the
defense
attorney
will
take
the
stand
and
tell
us
of
his
client
overturning
tables
and
other
behavioral
acts
and
irrelevant
conversations,
we're
not
privy
to
the
information
which
we
could
utilize
to
show
that
this
individual
is
indeed
manipulating
the
system.
and
that
is--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--since
1917,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
they
certainly
have
an
incentive
to
marshall
that
evidence.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
it's
not
unprecedented.
i
have
seen
several
cases
where
they
have
taken
the
stand,
and
again
it
is
a
one-sided
endeavor
with
respect
to
prosecution.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
exactly.
and
with
respect
to--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--your
honor,
he'd
be
subject
to
cross-examination,
but
it
has
not
been
resolved
as
to
the
intrusiveness
into
the
actual
attorney-client
privilege.
if
the
prosecution
was
to
inquire
please
relate
to
me
with
specificity
the
ability
with
which
he
related
the
facts
surrounding
the
crime,
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
mr.
medina,
because
he
can't
recall
murdering
these
people.
he's
been
told
he
murdered
them,
but
he
can't
recall,
and
if
we
ask
the
defense
attorney,
has
he
said
anything
to
you
which
would
contradict
that,
we're
not
going
to
get
an
answer.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
don't
know
that
that
has
been
precisely
litigated,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
has
been
a
distinction
drawn
between
challenging
the
competency
of
your
counsel
and
challenging
the
mental
competency
of
the
defendant.
and
california
law
provides
that
it
is
only
when
the
defendant
challenges
the
competency
of
the
attorney
that
we
can
go
into
that
area.
so
really,
if
petitioner
is
to
prevail
today,
it
would
appear
the
prosecution
should
be
entitled
to
some
very
intrusive
discovery,
but
we
can't
be
sure
of
that.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
no,
there
has
never
been
that
specific
question
addressed.
however,
it
is
made
quite
clear
that
it
is
waived
when
the
defense
attorney's
competency
is
challenged,
not
when
the
defendant
challenges
mental
competency,
so
we
have
no
assurances
in
that
regard.
now,
with
respect
to
the
particular
california
scheme,
we
rely
strongly
on
this
court's
reaffirmation
that
the
state
has
a
preeminent
role
in
the
allocation
of
burdens
of
proof
with
respect
to
matters
such
as
we
face
today.
this
court
has
been
reluctant
to
disturb--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--your
honor,
i
rely
heavily
on
patterson
v.
new
york,
and
particularly
the
language
in
martin
v.
ohio,
which
characterizes
the
strength
of
patterson,
which
reiterates
the
opportunities
that
this
court
has
had
to
depart
from
leland,
and
it
has
repeatedly
declined
to
do
so.
and
we
rely
heavily
upon
patterson
v.
new
york
for
support
as
to
our
discretion
in
this
area.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes.
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
it
does.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
think
that
we
find
support
in
that.
as
you'll
notice,
we
have
not
undertaken
any
type
of
analysis
under
mathews
v.
eldridge
because
it's
our
position
we
need
not
reach
such,
because
we
are
within
the
rights
as
defined
under
patterson
v.
new
york.
there
is
no
tradition
which
we
are
violating.
our
process
is
certainly
reasonable
within
the
discussion
of
morrison.
we
certainly
are
not
placing
an
oppressive
burden
on
the
defendant.
we
are
not
compelling
any
hardship.
we
are
asking
merely
that
he
show
to
the
jury
that
it
is
more
probable
than
not
that
he
is
incompetent
than
competent.
now,
with
respect
to
counsel's
remarks
about
focusing
on
the
trial
court's
declaration
of
doubt,
it's
important
to
focus
on
that
particular
determination
by
the
trial
court.
that
is
the
determination
which
decides
whether
there
will
be
an
inquiry
at
all,
and
counsel
has
no
problem
with
california's
allocation
of
both
a
burden
of
production
and
burden
of
persuasion
at
that
point.
however,
he
suggests
that
once
the
trial
court
has
declared
a
doubt
and
asked
for
a
competency
hearing,
that
somehow
california
should
change
its
presumption
and
its
allocations,
and
there's
nothing
to
support
that.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
it's
only
when
the
defendant's
incompetency
claim
is
going
to
be
subject
to
an
adversarial
setting,
where
the
prosecution
will
have
the
ability
to
produce
evidence
and
to
cross-examine
and
look
into
the
defendant's
allocations,
that
suddenly
there's
a
problem.
the
determination
of
doubt
does
not
preclude
the
state
of
california
from
utilizing
procedures
which
will
help
to
ensure
that
the
risk
of
erroneous
determinations
adverse
to
the
state's
interests
are
reduced.
as
this
court--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--well,
yes.
in
california
it's
done
by
a
jury
and
requires
a
unanimous
jury
verdict.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
but
it's
our
position
that
if
a
defendant
cannot
convince
12
jurors
that
it's
more
likely
he's
incompetent
than
competent,
indeed
he
should
stand
trial.
mr.
medina
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
present
evidence
to
12
jurors,
and
he
could
not
convince
one
of
those
jurors
that
it
was
more
likely
that
he
was
incompetent,
and
the
jury
picked
a
foreman
and
read
its
verdict
in
less
than
2
hours.
there's
no
denial
of
due
process
here.
but,
no,
that
is
our
position.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
procedurally,
if
we
had
a
hung
jury
in
california
we'd
do
it
again.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes.
so
if
that
were
the
scenario
we'd
do
it
over
again.
we'd
have
another
6-day
hearing.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that's
correct.
if
a
jury
comes
back--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--that's
correct.
if
we
have
a
unanimous
jury
verdict
it
could
be
based
on
equipoise,
and
we
don't
know
if
they
utilized
the
presumption
or
not.
and
with
respect
to
equipoise,
i
can
only
observe
that
in
the
event
there's
an
erroneous
guilt
determination
we
cannot
equate
that
with
a
guilty
man...
with
an
innocent
man
being
found
guilty.
we
cannot
make
that
correlation.
and
additionally,
when
an
individual
proceeds
to
trial
they
are
accorded
all
the
protections
afforded,
including
the
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard.
additionally,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
finality
of
the
decision
here
can
impact
as
to
the
fairness
of
what
has
been
allocated.
and
a
competency
determination
is
not
final.
if
there
is
a
change
in
circumstances
which
suggest
that
the
original
competency
finding
was
erroneous--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--yes.
if
there
is
behavioral
outburst--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--absolutely.
if
the
defense
attorney
is
encompassing
problems,
it
can
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
and
we
can
stop
the
proceedings
again
and
again
litigate
the
idea
of
competency.
so
the
absence
of
finality
is
a
factor
to
be
considered,
and
the
uniqueness
of
this
proceeding
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
manner
in
which
california
has
allocated
the
burden.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
it
is
definitely
not
of
evidentiary
value,
and
it
is
simply
a
restatement
of
the--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--my
reference
was
if
the
jury
cannot
resolve
it
and
truly
believes
that
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise
the
law
instructs
them
that
it
is
the
defendants,
or
whoever
is
asserting
incompetence,
it
is
their
burden,
so
by
virtue
of
their
failing
to
meet
the
burden,
they
are
to
return
the
competency
finding.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
it's
in
accord
with
the
statutory
language.
it
starts
out
by
stating
there's
a
presumption.
it's
probably
surplus.
but
again,
there
is
no
evidentiary
value
to
presumptions
in
california.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
the
jury
is
instructed
on
very
simple
language,
which
indicates
that--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--they
are
not
specifically
told
that
it
has
an
evidentiary
force,
but
there's--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--no,
i
don't
understand
how
a
lay
person
would
make
such
a
judgment.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
no,
i
don't
think
that
they
would...
i
don't
think
they
would
interpret
the
presumption
of
competency
to
have
evidentiary
value.
i
don't
think,
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--if
that
were
the
order
in
which
they
were
instructed,
i
might
agree,
but
here
it
states
a
criminal
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
mentally
competent.
then
it
begins
to
recite
how
they
are
to
make
their
determination,
and
then
they
are
instructed
that
when
everything
is
equal,
when
the
evidence
is
equal,
they
are
to
find
for
competency.
so
i
don't
believe
the
instruction
as
written
could
lead
to
that
result.
and
in
conclusion
i
would
just
like
to
read
from
snyder
v.
massachusetts
that
justice,
though
due
to
the
accused,
is
due
to
the
accuser
also,
and
the
concept
of
fairness
must
not
be
strained
until
it
is
narrowed
to
a
filament
is
we
are
to
keep
the
balance
true.
mr.
medina
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
demonstrate
his
mental
incompetency.
there
has
been
no
denial
of
due
process
by
california
and
its
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
after
the
finding
and
declaration
of
a
doubt
with
respect
to
competency.
and
if
there
are
no
questions,
california
would
submit,
mr.
chief
justice.
