white
xxx.
justice
white
would
the
burden
of
proof
be
satisfied
if
the
government
proved
by
a
preponderance?
justice
white
well,
you
would
not
insist
on
a
higher
standard
of
proof
than
a
preponderance.
justice
white
i
didn't
ask
you...
do
you
think
that
a
preponderance
standard
is
constitutional
if
the
government
undertook
that?
justice
white
i'm
glad.
justice
white
he
could
get
to
all
the
evidence
that
the
state
could
get
to.
i
suppose
the
only
way
the
state
can
prove
competence
is
having
him
examined
and
through
medical
testimony.
justice
white
do
you
think
they
could
put
his
lawyer
on
the
stand,
the
state?
justice
white
well,
certainly
you
don't
suggest
that
the
state
has
access
to
more
sources
to
prove
competence
than
the
defendant
would
have.
justice
white
so
the
defense
has
an
equal
ability
to
get
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
think
the
defendant
would
have
sources
that
the
state
couldn't
really
command.
justice
white
well,
what
about
the
lawyer?
justice
white
so
they
can
take
the
lawyer
and
say
what
did
he
tell
you
and
what
did
he
say
about
this
crime,
or
not?
justice
white
well,
at
least
the
defendant
has
equal
access
to
information.
justice
white
this
burden
of
proof
has
been
imposed
on
defendants
in
california
for
quite
a
while.
justice
white
well,
you
would
think
that
if
the
defendant
has
the
burden
to
prove
not
only
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence
but...
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof,
you
would
think
that
attorneys
would
play
a
major
role
in
producing
evidence
of
incompetency.
and
they
would
all
be...
if
there
was
any
evidence
around,
you
would
think
that
they
would
be
on
the
stand
all
the
time.
justice
white
well,
do
they
appear
a
lot,
or
not?
justice
white
well,
they
take
the
stand
on
the
defendant's
side
of
the
case.
justice
white
yes,
in
furthering
his
claim
of
incompetency.
justice
white
i
suppose
if
the
lawyer
takes
the
stand
and
testifies
to
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
i
suppose
he's
subject
to
cross-examination
to...
in
areas
that
he
hasn't
testified
to.
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
just
leland
and
the
reaffirmation
of
it
controls
this
case,
do
you?
justice
white
other
than
to
support
the
notion
that
you
should
leave
it
to
the
state,
but--
justice
white
if
the
jury
comes
back
with
a
verdict
turning
down
the
defendant's
submission
of
incompetency,
you
don't
really
know
whether
the
jury
in
the
jury
room
said
gee,
this
is
a
toss-up.
and
so
we
have
to
rely
on
the
presumption,
because
they
are
instructed
on
the
presumption,
aren't
they?
justice
white
so
you
really
don't
know
if
they
thought
it
was
a
tie.
justice
white
based,
for
example,
on
his
performance
during
trial?
justice
white
or
outside
of
trial.
justice
white
why
do
they
instruct
on
the
presumption?
because
the
statue
says
so?
