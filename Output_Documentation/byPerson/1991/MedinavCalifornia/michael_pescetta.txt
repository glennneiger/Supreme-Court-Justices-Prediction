mr.
michael
pescetta
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
think
the
exodus
from
the
courtroom
shows,
the
issue
in
this
case
affects
a
lot
fewer
people
than
does
the
taxing
system
of
california.
in
fact--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
in
a
situation
after
a
trial
court
has
found
a
bona
fide
doubt
as
to
the
defendant's
capacity
to
proceed
in
a
criminal
matter,
as
to
the
defendant's
capacity
to
cooperate
rationally
with
counsel
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
the
charges,
whether,
after
that
doubt
has
been
declared,
the
state
can,
consistent
with
due
process,
put
the
burden
on
that
individual
whose
competence
is
in
question
to
prove
incompetence
by
a
preponderance
and
in
that
proceeding
impose
an
evidentiary
presumption
of
competence
which
is
contained
in
a
jury
instruction.
and
i
would
like
to
start,
i
think,
by
emphasizing
what
we
are
not
arguing
in
this
case,
which
i
think
is
confused
to
some
degree
by
the
briefing
of
amici
curiae
on
behalf
of
respondent.
we
are
not
contending
that
the
presumption
of
competence
as
an
initial
matter,
insofar
as
it
imposes
upon
the
defendant
or
counsel
or
any
other
party
asserting
the
defendant's
incompetence
an
initial
burden
of
production
to
come
forward
and
raise
that
bona
fide
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
trial
court
that
the
defendant
is
not
competent
to
proceed
with
the
criminal
proceeding--
so
we
are
not...
as
amicus
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
contends,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
quote,
presumption
of
sanity
imposed
by
the
common
law
is
constitutionally
impermissible.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
after
that
initial
doubt
has
arisen
in
the
mind
of
the
trial
court,
whether
at
that
juncture,
focusing
on
that
stage
of
the
proceedings,
the
presumption
of
competency
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
constitutional.
mr.
michael
pescetta
our
contention...
is
yes,
your
honor,
that
if
the
government
proved
by
a
preponderance
that
the
defendant
is
competent
to
stand
trial,
that...
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
your
honor's
question.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
submit
that
we
do
not
need
to
go
any
farther
than
that
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
the
difficulty
with
the
resolution
of
those
issues
in
this
kind
of
case
i
think
is
dependent
largely
on
psychiatric
testimony,
and
i
will
try
to
discuss
that
in
the
context
of
the
mathews
test
in
a
moment,
but
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
those
kinds
of
decisions
are
fraught
with
risk
of
error,
and
therefore
although
the
preponderance
standard
is
a
low
standard
in
which
the
burden...
in
which
the
risk
of
error
is
roughly
evenly
shared
by
the
parties,
we
submit
that
that
standard
is
the
least
that
is
constitutionally
mandated.
that
is--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--maybe
i
expressed
myself
ineptly.
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
a
state
can,
consistent
with
the
constitution,
adopt
a
higher
standard
of
proof,
but
in...
but
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
to
show
competence
to
stand
trial
is
the
minimum
that
the
constitution
tolerates
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
submit
that
a
state
may
impose
a
higher
burden,
but
we
are
saying--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes.
i
will
concede
that
yes,
the
preponderance
standard
is
the
highest
that
the
federal
constitution
mandates.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
think
that
suspicion
might
be
rational,
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
contending,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
a
line
of
cases,
this
court's
cases
dealing
with
government
intrusion
on
fundamental
rights
and
other
criminal
contexts,
for
instance...
lego
v.
twomey,
united
states
v.
matlock...
where
a
preponderance
burden
is
placed
on
the
government
to
get
the
defendant
out
from
under
a
constitutional
protection
which
he
has
brought
himself
within.
i
submit
that
that
is...
that
that
same
kind
of
analysis
is
apt
here.
i
submit
that
there
are
certainly
cases
applying
the
mathews
analysis,
like
addington
v.
texas
where
a
higher
standard
of
proof
has
been
imposed
by
this
court.
we
are
arguing
here
only
that
a
preponderance
standard
to
show
competence
to
stand
trial
is
constitutionally
mandated,
because
in
this
very
difficult
area
the
risk
of
error
can
be
shared
no
more
by
the
defendant
than
by
the
state,
and
that
that
analysis
leads
to
the
result
that
showing
competence
by
a
preponderance
will
satisfy
the
constitution.
if
the
court
would
like
to
go
further,
i
would
not
object
to
that,
but
i
think
that
disposes
of
this
case,
certainly,
because
in
this
case
the
evidence
is
very,
very
closely
balanced
and
a
finding
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
a
showing
at
least
by
a
preponderance,
i
submit,
will
result
in
a
reversal
of
this
matter.
to
go
back
to
the
analytical
structure
for
a
moment,
i
think
that
we
can
think
of
the
constitutional
structure
that
is
imposed
by
the
lego-matlock
line
of
cases
in
the
following
way.
once
the
defendant
has
brought
him
or
herself
within
the
ambit
of
a
constitutional
protection,
in
a
case
like
nix
v.
williams,
for
instance,
has
shown
that
there
was
a
search,
that
there
was
no
warrant,
that
something
was
actually
seized
that's
going
to
be
admitted
into
evidence,
that
once
the
defendant
is
underneath
that
constitutional
umbrella
that
the
burden
then
constitutionally,
appropriately,
shifts
to
the
state
to
boot
the
defendant
back
out
into
the
rain
by
showing,
as
in
nix
v.
williams,
that
there
is
an
inevitable
discovery
of
that
same
evidence.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i'm
simply
talking
about
any
constitutional
protection.
mr.
michael
pescetta
that's
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
those
are
different
constitutional
provisions.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
once
the
defendant
has
brought
him
or
herself
within
the
ambit
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
protection,
there
is
nothing
strange
about
placing
the
burden
on
the
government
or
state--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
i
may
not
be
correct
in
every
instance,
your
honor.
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
to
harmonize
the
cases
in
which...
attempt
to
harmonize
in
a...
in
something
of
a
coherent
scheme
some
of
the
approaches
that
this
court
has
taken
in
which
the
burden
has
been
placed
on
the
state
to
make
a
showing
by
a
preponderance
to
get
a
defendant
out
from
some
constitutional
protection.
what
respondent
has
argued
is
that
except
for
the
elements
of
criminal
offense
the
state
never
has
to
bear
any
burdens,
and
that
is
just
plain
wrong,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit
in
this
case
the
historical
evidence,
though
not
terribly
clear,
favors
petitioner's
position
as
much
as
respondent's
certainly.
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
detailed
analysis
of
the
differences
between
burdens
of
persuasion
and
burdens
of
production
are
a
relatively
new
development
in
legal
analysis.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
strong
historical
showing
that
one
side
or
the
other
is...
that
one
side
or
the
other
has
a
position
that
has
been
unequivocally
accepted,
as
in
the
case
of
leland
v.
oregon
and
other
affirmative
defense
cases,
that
the
burden
of
proof
can
be
placed
on
the
defendant,
that
that's
one
situation.
i
submit
that
when
the
historical
evidence
is
more
murky,
that
there
is
at
least
no
presumption
that
what
the
defendant
is
asking
for
as
an
additional
procedural
protection
is
completely
out
of
the
ballpark.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
application
of
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
analysis
provides
a
structure
for
determining
whether
or
not--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--in
united
states
v.
raddatz
and
in
ake
v.
oklahoma
the
court
did
so.
i
submit
that
some
of
the
other
decisions
by
the
court
could
be
harmonized
through
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
test,
although
it's
not...
it's
certainly
not
cited
in
those
cases.
i
think
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
situations
in
which
the
defendant
has
brought
him
or
herself
within
a
constitutional
protection
and
contrasted
with
the
cases
in
which...
the
affirmative
defense
kind
of
cases,
running
from
leland
v.
oregon
to
justice
white's
opinion
in
patterson
v.
new
york,
that
there
is
a
different
analysis
when
the
state
has
brought
the
defendant
by
proving
the
commission
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
within
a
constitutionally
acceptable
umbrella
of
culpability,
that
then
the
burden
can
appropriately
and
constitutionally
be
placed
on
the
defendant
to
get
him
or
herself
back
out
from
under
that
level
of...
that
umbrella
of
culpability.
but
the
inquiry
in
this
kind
of
case
is
sui
generis
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
only
situation
in
which
the
defendant's
own
ability
to
cooperate
in
the
current
proceeding,
in
the
proceedings
on
competence
as
well
as
ultimately
in
the
criminal
proceedings,
has
an
effect
on
the
ability
to
litigate.
and
that's
our...
i
think
that
that
is
really
the
intuitive
bottom
line
here,
that
once
that
initial
burden
of
production
has
been
met,
once
that
state
trial
court
has
looked
down
on
the
defendant
and
said
i
doubt
whether
you
can
cooperate
with
your
counsel
in
litigating
this
case,
i
doubt
whether
you
can
cooperate
rationally
in
this
proceeding,
whether
it
makes
sense...
whether
it
makes
rational
constitutional
sense
then
to
turn
to
that
same
defendant
and
say,
and
you're
the
one
who
has
to
prove
that,
because
the
mental
condition
that
gives
rise
to
that
doubt
in
the
initial
burden
of
production
stage
will
in
hard
cases
make
it
that
much
more
difficult
for
that
party
to
meet
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
ultimate
issue.
mr.
michael
pescetta
the
state
has--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--that
has
been
done.
that...
i
think
if
you
look
at
a
case
that
justice
kennedy
sat
on
in
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--the
state
has
the
same
access
to
evidence
that
the
defense
has,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
the
lawyer,
his
observations
of
the
defendant's
demeanor
and
mental
state,
they
are
available
to
the
prosecution.
the
case
that
i
was
referring
to
a
minute
ago
that
justice
kennedy
sat
on
in
the
ninth
circuit,
darrow
v.
gunn,
explicitly
recognized
that
under
california
law--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
in
fact,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
investigator,
who
was
covered
by
the
attorney-client
privilege,
got
on
the
stand
and
testified
to
what
the
defendant
had
told
him
about
the
client,
which
was
nothing.
he
testified
to
what
his
communications
with
the
client
had
been,
and
that
evidence--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
equal
access
implies
that
the
defendant,
him
or
herself,
does
have
control
over
the
evidence
of
his
or
her
mental
state,
and
i
submit
that
the
problem
in
this
case
is
precisely
that
the
mental
disorder
that
is
the
source
of
this
competency
proceeding--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--yes,
your
honor,
but
so
does
the
state.
and
the
state
in
similar
instances,
and
certainly
i
submit
in
this
case,
has
superior
access
to
the
defendant
when
he's
incarcerated,
has
as
much
resources
as
the
defense...
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
what
defendant's
family
members
testified
to
as
to
his
behavior
in
jail
was
on
the
basis
of
episodic
visits.
what
the
prosecution's
witness,
sergeant...
detective...
deputy
green,
i
believe
his
name
was,
testified
was
to
a
whole
year
of
records--
mr.
michael
pescetta
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
pescetta
--that's
the
ultimate
test,
and
what
we're
arguing
is--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
attorney
knows
it,
i
submit,
that
evidence
is
available
to
the
state.
the
difficulty
is
that
that
defendant's
ability
to
establish
or
persuade
or
communicate
his
actual
inability
to
communicate
rationally
may,
and
in
this
case
i
believe
was,
compromised
by
the
very
mental
disorder
in
question.
i
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
mcneil
v.
director
of
the
patuxent
institution
is
on
point
here,
because
the
analysis
here
is,
i
submit
from
the
state's
point
of
view,
assumes
the
question
in
issue.
it
assumes
that
the
defendant
has
access
to
the
evidence
of
his
or
her
mental
state,
in
some
sense
because
it
assumes
that
the
defendant
is
competently
regulating
the
access
of
both
his
own
counsel
and
the
experts
and
the
state
to
what
is
ultimately
a
question
of
what
is
inside
his
or
her
head.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
your
honor,
the
initial
stage
at
which
those
cases
are
weeded
out
is
the
stage
at
which
no
bona
fide
doubt
as
to
competence
arises
in
the
first
instance.
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
vast
majority
of
cases...
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
maggio
v.
fulford
is
a
good
example...
most
of
the
cases
deal
with
instances
in
which
trial
courts
say
i
don't
have
a
bona
fide
doubt
as
to
this
defendant's
competence.
and
those
determinations
are
routinely,
overwhelmingly
upheld
on
appeal
and
on
collateral
attack.
now,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
cases
this
issue
never
arises
at
all.
in
a
further
number...
a
further
vast
majority
of
those
cases
in
which
it
does
arise,
there
is
no
dispute
because
the
experts
agree,
because
the
courts
agree
with
the
experts.
it
is
only
in
the
difficult
cases...
and
i
submit
that
this
language...
this
court's
language
in
morrison
v.
california
is
apt
on
this
point...
it
is
only
in
the
difficult
cases,
it
is
only
in
the
cases
where
the
defendant
may
actually
be
hampered
in
his
ability
to
produce
evidence
of
his
or
her
own
incompetence,
that
this
burden
of
proof
question
makes
a
difference.
and
it
makes
a
very
substantial,
in
fact
a
fundamental
outcome-determinative
difference,
in
those
cases
in
which,
when
the
defendant
has
produced
a
draw,
as
your
honor
puts
it,
when
we
have
to
decide
what
is
the
worst
damage
that
is
done...
trying
that
defendant
when
he
is
arguably
incompetent,
or
committing
him
as
incompetent
when
there
is
a
chance
that
he
is
in
fact
competent.
that,
i
submit,
relates
to
the
cost
element
of
the
state's
interest
under
the
mathews
test,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
evidence
that
we've
submitted
in
our
brief
and
that
has
not
been
contested
at
all
by
respondent
or
by
any
of
the
amici
in
this
case
is
that
that...
that
the
imposition
that
that
places
on
the
state
is
minimal.
it
is
very
minimal.
the
california
statute
itself
requires
a
report
within
15
days
after
the
committal
of
an
individual
as
incompetent.
now,
if
that
individual
is
in
fact
competent
there
is
an
easy
means
by
which
the
director
of
the
facility
to
which
the
defendant
is
committed
can
return
that
defendant
almost
immediately
to
the
court
he
or
she
came
from.
the
evidence
that
we've
supplied
in
the
studies
by
roesch
and
golding,
who
are
i
think
the
leading
authorities
in
this
field,
shows
that
an
average
stay
in
a
commitment
as
incompetent
is
43
days.
and
just
to
put
that
in
perspective,
if
i
may,
that's
less
than
half
of
the
time
that
this
court
allows
for
petitioning
for
certiorari
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
pescetta
my
understanding
of
that
statistic
is
that
43
days
is
the
average
duration
of
the
commitment,
so
that
in
an
average
of
43
days
the
defendant
is
returned
to
the
court
as
competent,
and
that's
an
average
of
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
received
at
the
facility
and
immediately
turned
around
and
returned
to
the
court
as
competent,
and
it
includes
cases
in
which
there
is
a
longer
commitment
when
the
state
would
suffer
no
harm
to
its
interest
because
the
defendant
is
in
fact
incompetent
and
it
has
taken
whatever
the
amount
of
days
it
is
to
restore
his
competence.
mr.
michael
pescetta
california
law
provides
for
outpatient
treatment
in
appropriate
cases.
in
general,
it
is
commitment
to
a
mental
health
facility
and
there's
a
whole
range
of
mental
health
facilities.
mr.
michael
pescetta
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
medina
was
incarcerated
in
the
county
jail
prior
to
trial
and
he
would
have
been
incarcerated
i
am
sure
in
atascadero
or
patton
state
hospital,
which
are
the
normal
places
for
commitment
as
incompetents.
in
either
event,
he
would
have
been
committed
to
a
mental
health
facility,
where,
i
think
the
studies
show
unanimously,
the
chances
of
a
more
accurate
determination
of
whether
mr.
medina
is
or
is
not,
in
fact
incompetent,
can
or
cannot
voluntarily
cooperate
with
counsel,
can
be
made.
and
i
submit
that
the
increase
in
the
accuracy
of
the
decision
which
is
afforded
by
that
commitment
to
a
mental
health
facility
is
also
a
factor
pushing
in
favor
of
saying
that
the
consequences
of
an
erroneous
finding
of
incompetence
are
less
serious
than
the
consequences
of
an
erroneous
finding
of
competence.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i
certainly
do
not
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
only
criterion.
it
is
certainly
a
factor
in
the
mathews
analysis.
and
the
other
factors,
there's
certainly
no
question
but
that
the
trial
of
an
incompetent
defendant
is
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
that's
what
the
statute
in
california
contemplates,
is
appointment
of
experts.
my
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
defense
counsel's
access
to
evidence
is
superior
at
the
point
where
the
initial
burden
of
production
is
placed
on
the
defendant,
where
the
defense
counsel
is,
we
concede,
in
the
best
position
to
go
to
the
trial
court
and
say,
i
cannot
communicate
with
this
defendant,
please
appoint
experts,
we
have
to
have
a
competency
hearing.
but
once
that
proceeding
is
initiated
that
goes
away,
because
the
prosecution,
the
court,
has
the
power
under
estelle
v.
smith,
under
all
of
the
rules
that
we've
cited
in
the
briefing,
to
obtain
evidence
of
the
defendant's
mental
condition.
and
the
defense
counsel,
i
submit,
in
the
instance,
for
instance
where
the
defendant
turned
over
the
table
in
the
courtroom,
the
defense
counsel
had
no
superior
ability
to
know
whether
that
was
a
product
of
the
defendant's
mental
state,
of
his
underlying
mental
disorder,
than
anyone
else
did.
mr.
michael
pescetta
there
is
normally
an...
a...
the
experts
normally
give
tests,
if
they
can,
to
the
defendant.
there
is
a
range
of
mental
states.
the
mental
state
that
the
prosecutor
suggested
was
the
standard
of
competence
in
this
case,
whether
the
defendant
is
a
vegetable,
that
doesn't
fall,
really,
within
our
problem
here,
because
that's
not
going
to
be
disputed
if
the
defendant
is
literally
a
quote,
vegetable,
unquote.
if
it
is
clear
that
a
defendant
who
has
no
psychiatric
history,
no
evidence
of
mental
impairment,
is
just
saying
he
or
she
is
mentally
incompetent
in
order
to
delay
the
proceedings,
which
was
the
situation
in
maggio
v.
fulford,
that's
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum.
it's
in
the
middle
where
the
expertise
of
the
experts
is
directed
not
only
at
the
ultimate
question
of
the
defendant's
ability
to
cooperate
with
counsel
in
the
criminal
proceedings,
but
in
his
ability
to
cooperate
now
that
the
expert's
opinion
is
crucial
and
they
do
standard
psychological
tests
on
him.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
pescetta
i'll
try
to
talk
fast.
to
respond
to
the
access
question,
there
is
no
doubt,
i
submit,
that
once
defense
counsel
or
any
party
initiates
the
competency
inquiry,
that
all
bets
are
off
as
to
the
defendant's
invocation
of
any
privileges...
his
own
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
attorney-client
privilege.
all
the
evidence
is
available
if
the
prosecution
wants
it.
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--well,
certainly
that's
true
under
estelle
v.
smith
with
respect
to
the
confidentiality
of
the
expert
evaluations.
certainly
in
this
case
defense
counsel
did
make
representations
as
to
communications
made
to
him
by
the
defendant
in
the
course
of
the
competency
proceeding,
and
so
did
the
defense
investigator.
so
i
submit
that
there
is
a
fallacy--
mr.
michael
pescetta
--but
your
honor
the
only
way
the
inquiry
starts
is
when
counsel
makes
a
representation
about
the
substance
of
his
communications.
that
is,
this
defendant
cannot
rationally
cooperate
with
me
in
presenting
this
case.
mr.
michael
pescetta
well,
yes,
your
honor,
but
that...
to
the
extent
that
that's
based
on
behavior,
that
demeanor
evidence
is
equally
available
to
the
state.
to
the
extent
that
defense
counsel
is
invoking
the
incompetency
procedure,
that
is
necessary
based
on
defense
counsel's
arguably
privileged
communication.
mr.
michael
pescetta
my
understanding
of
california
law
is
that
once
the
competency
proceeding
is
initiated,
the
privileged...
the
privilege...
the
defendant's
ability
to
invoke
privileges
is
gone.
now,
as
to
the...
as
to
what
happens
in
the
event
of
a
toss-up,
i
submit
that
the
state
is
wrong
in
suggesting
that
the
defendant
can
ask
for
repeated
competency
proceedings.
