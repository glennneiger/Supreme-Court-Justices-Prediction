justice
scalia
--why
do
you
make
that
concession?
it
just
seems
like
a
good
idea?
i
don't
know
how
you
go
about
deciding
your
principles
here.
why
not
go
for
the
whole
thing
while
we
are
at
it?
i
mean,
you
are
not
tying
the
rest
of
your
principles
to
any
case
law
or
any
long
tradition
of
practice
as
far
as
i
know
of,
so
what
is
the
basis
for
stopping
short
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
except
the
suspicion
that
we
might
not
accept
it?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
cases
to
which
this
rule
you're
urging
upon
us
applies.
you
argue
as
though
it
only
applies
to
those
cases
in
which
in
fact
the
defendant
is
incompetent,
but
it
will
apply
to
all
cases,
whether
he's
incompetent
or
not,
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
regardless
of
whether
the
access
to
facts
is
the
same
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution
and
the
defense,
which
i
doubt,
certainly
the
possibility
of
a
malingering
defendant
who
really
is
not
mentally
incompetent,
his
possibility
to
produce
a
mere
draw
by
pretending
incompetence
is
i
think
considerable,
and
that's
the
result.
all
he
has
to
do
is
produce
a
draw
that
you
really
can't
tell
whether
he's
competent
or
incompetent,
and
in
that
event
he
can't
be
tried.
justice
scalia
well,
you
can
say
that
about
a
lot
of
criminal
rules.
i
mean,
at
some
point
any
system
that
is
going
to
commit
people
to
prison
is
going
to...
you
can
say
any
rule,
if
you
don't
have
it,
the
consequence
will
be
this
person
might
go
free,
but
if
you
have
it
it
will
mean
an
innocent
person
will
be
put
away.
you
can't
adopt
any
rules
without
that
kind
of
consequence.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
we
should
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
only
when...
put
the
burden
on
the
state
only
when
the
defendant
is
seeking
it
and
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
when
the
state
is
seeking
it,
and
vice
versa.
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
could
the
defense
attorney
be
required
to
provide
that...
i
don't
understand
how
a
competency
hearing
would...
is
conducted.
is
the
defense
attorney
usually
put
on
the
stand
to
testify?
whoever
has
the
burden
of
proof?
