justice
souter
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
go
back
to
one
issue?
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
presumption
is
itself
of
independent
evidentiary
force,
as
opposed
to
merely
being
a
sort
of
opaque
way
of
stating
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
souter
i
thought
you
were
indicating
that
it
was
when
you
answered
justice
white,
or
i
think
agreed
with
justice
white,
that
it
might
be
that
the...
when
the
verdict
comes
back...
the
verdict
of
competence...
that
it
reflects
the
presumption
rather
than
mere
equipoise.
justice
souter
well,
are
they...
is
the
jury
instructed
on
that?
justice
souter
well,
does
the
simple
language
state
what
you
just
told
me,
that
a
presumption
has
no
evidentiary
force
in
california?
justice
souter
well,
if
they're
not
told
that,
don't
you
think
that
a
normal
juror
would
assume
that
the
presumption,
as
in
the
instructions
here,
did
carry
some
evidentiary
force?
justice
souter
is
that
because
you
assume
a
lay
person
wouldn't
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
in
the
first
place?
justice
souter
well,
why
wouldn't
the
jurors...
i
mean,
don't
we
assume
that
the
jurors
are
going
to
be
rationale
at
least
to
the
extent
of
assuming
that
if
they
are
instructed
on
a
burden
of
proof,
then
are
instructed
on
a
presumption,
that
the
probable
inference
is
the
presumption
means
something
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
burden
of
proof,
and
if
that's
the
case,
isn't
the
juror
going
to
say
gee,
if
we're...
if
the
see-saw
is
level,
we
better
give
effect
to
the
presumption.
justice
souter
--well,
that's
not
so,
is
it?
the
judge
can
raise
it
sua
sponte.
justice
souter
yes,
but
what
if
he
doesn't
invoke
it?
is
your
answer
clearly
correct
even
in
cases
in
which
he
does
not
invoke
it?
