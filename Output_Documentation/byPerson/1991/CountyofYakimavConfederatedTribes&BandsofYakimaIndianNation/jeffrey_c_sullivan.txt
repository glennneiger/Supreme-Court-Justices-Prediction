mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
can
yakima
county
impose
real
estate
property
tax
on
fee
lands
owned
by
tribal
members
and
the
yakima
indian
nation
and
collect
its
real
estate
excise
tax
on
the
sale
of
those
fee
lands?
it
is
our
position
that
this
authority
exists,
that
congress
has
reaffirmed
that
authority
on
a
number
of
occasions
since
its
inception
in
1887,
that
this
court
has
uniformly
held
that
the
tax
on
fee
lands
is
appropriate,
and
that
generally
everybody
agreed
with
that
position,
including
the
solicitor
general
and
its
staff
until
1989...
we
say,
and
believe
in
response
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
in
1887,
the
general
allotment
act
was
passed.
the
general
allotment
act,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
provided
a
number
of
things.
first,
land
was
to
be
held
in
trust
for
a
25-year
period
of
time.
at
the
end
of
that
trust
period,
the
individual
allottees
were
to
receive
fee
patents.
with
those
fee
patents
went
two
things:
(1)
citizenship,
and
(2)
the
responsibility
of
paying
tax...
along
with
the
rights
of
alienation
of
that
property,
and
the
ability
to
sell
and
deal
with
it
as
any
other
citizen
would.
in
1906
the
congress
reaffirmed
and
clarified,
we
believe,
its
intent.
in
1906
the
burke
act
was
passed.
it
was
passed
in...
partly
in
response
to
one
of
this
court's
opinions
in
in
re
heff,
to
reaffirm
that
you
didn't
become
a
citizen
until
the
fee
patent
was
issued.
but
when
it
was
issued,
you
became
a
citizen;
and
secondly,
the
1906
act
shortened
the
trust
period,
or
at
least
it
allowed
the
secretary
to
shorten
the
trust
period
from
25
years
into
a
basically
an
individual
decision
of
the
secretary.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
believe
that
the...
if
the...
if
it's
a
tribal
member--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
believe
that
the
fee
lands
would
pass
under
the
provisions
of
state
law.
the
balance
of
his
estate
would
pass
under
the
rights
of
inheritance
as
established
in
the
united
states
code
and
rules
of--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
don't
believe
it
ever
has
been
raised,
or
any
case
in
which
it
has
been
a
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
in
1906,
this
court
was
called
about
in
goudy
v.
meath
to
address
this
issue.
do
tribal
members
who
own
fee
patent
have
to
pay
real
estate
property
tax?
this
court
said,
it
requires
a
technical
and
narrow
construction
to
hold
that
involuntary
alienation
continues
to
be
forbidden,
while
the
power
of
voluntary
alienation
is
granted.
and
it
is
disregarding
the
act
of
congress
to
hold
that
an
indian
having
property
is
not
subject
to
taxation
when
he
is
a
subject
to
all
the
laws,
civil
and
criminal,
of
the
state.
subsequent
to
that...
particularly
the
1906
act
and
also
this
court's
decision
in
goudy...
and
i
think,
parenthetic,
it's
important
to
understand
because
the
government
has
raised
it,
but
what
about
property
that
doesn't
follow
exactly
from
the
allotment
act
itself?
the
property
in
goudy
came
from
a
different
act.
do
you
remember
the
facts
in
goudy?
they
talked
about
a
10-year
trust
period
that
had
already
expired.
it
was
not
patented
under
the
general
allotment
act.
and
they
talked
from
this
time
forward
in
terms
of
fee
patents
and
trust
lands.
trust
lands
were
not
subject
to
tax;
fee
lands
were.
in
the
early
twenties,
as
a
result
of
this
particular
statute,
the
secretary
began
to
issue
patents.
many
of
the
indians
lost
their
land
to
tax
sales,
the
type
of
tax
sale
that
generated
the
litigation
in
this
case.
the
congress
was
called
upon
to
address
this
issue.
and
in
1927,
the
congress
did
not...
which
they
could
have
done...
say,
you
don't
have
to
pay
real
estate
property
tax
any
longer
on
your
fee
lands.
the
congress'
choice,
rather,
was
to
say,
you
can't
be
forced
to
take
one
of
these
patents
unless
you
don't...
unless
you
want
it.
you
must
consent.
and
the
government
can't
force
it
on
you.
19--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--we
don't
know
that.
the
record
in
the
stipulation
would
be
that
all
of
these
lands
were
patented
under
title...
excuse
me,
under
this
amendment
6
or
section
6.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
the
record
does
not
tell
us
that.
we
submit
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
was
during
the
trust
period
or
whether
it
was
after
the
trust
period.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
we
believe...
i
would...
i
can't
disagree
that
that
could
be
a
reading
given
to
the
proviso.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
we
submit,
however,
that
that
clearly
was
not
the
intent,
that
the
taxation
of
these
lands
were
meant
to
apply
to
all
lands
patented
in
any
manner.
and
i
think
that
goudy
reiterates
that,
and
this
court's
subsequent
opinions
would
indicate
that...
in
which
this
very
specific
issue
has
been
addressed,
i.e.,
should
these
lands...
or
the
proceeds
from
these
lands...
be
taxed.
and
that
distinction
has
never
been
made.
the
cases
are
replete;
the
statutes
are
replete;
the
congressional
record
is
replete,
that
the
distinction
is
between
trust
and
allotted
lands...
i
mean,
excuse
me...
trust
and
fee
land.
and
the
method
by
which...
the
technical
method
by
which
the
fee
is
obtained
is
of
no
consequence.
and
i
think
in
some
respects,
this
is...
our
position
is
bolstered
by
the
'79
opinion
of
the
solicitor
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
in
which
the
solicitor
in
that
opinion
says
that,
after
acquired,
a
title
appears
in
his
opinion,
at
least,
at
that
time,
is
also
covered.
so
that
the
distinction
for
the
county
assessor
and
for
the...
tax
collectors
among
the
counties
is
is
it
fee
land
or
is
it
trust
land.
and
if
it's
fee
land,
it
is
going
to
be
taxed
because
it
is
freely
alienable.
to
get
involved
in
the
very
stilted,
in
our
opinion,
interpretation
of
the
proviso
puts
us
in
a
difficult
position,
and
one
that
would
not
coincide,
we
believe,
with
this
court's
ruling
in
goudy.
the
tribe
and
the
government
make
a
big
deal,
in
some
respects,
in
terms
of
the
indian
reorganization
act.
we
submit,
again,
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
adopted
partially
because
of,
again,
this
similar
problem.
lands
were
being
lost;
the
tax...
the
land
base
of
the
tribe
was
being
diminished.
in
the
indian
reorganization
act,
the
congress,
again,
addressed
this
issue
and
they
did
so
by
saying
there
will
be
no
more
allotments.
they
extended
the
trust
period
indefinitely
and
allowed
for
the
secretary
to
return
some
of
these
lands
to
trust,
to
get
them
out
of
the
tax
base.
we
submit
that
that...
and
again,
congress
could
have
addressed
the
tax
issue
and
chose
not
to,
and
allowed
section
349
of
25
u.s.c.
to
remain
on
the
books.
in
1939,
this
court
in
board
of
commissioners
v.
jackson
county
was
dealing
with
the
problem...
okay,
because
by
this
time,
the
court
had
decided
that
if
you
didn't
consent
to
the
patent,
then
the
taxes
needed
to
be
returned.
but
the
court,
in
dealing
with
this
as
it
was...
as
it
directed...
or
as
it
was...
what
the
consequences
of
this
were
for
the
county
said,
in
consequence,
jackson
county
in
1919
began
to
subject
the
land
to
its
regular
property
taxes.
it
continued
to...
subject...
excuse
me...
it
continued
to
do
so
as
long
as
this
fee-simple
patent
was
left...
undisturbed
by
the
united
states.
jackson
county,
in
all
innocence,
acted
in
reliance
on
a
fee
patent
given
under
the
hand
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
here
is
a
long,
and
unexcused
delay,
referring
to
trying
to
get
the
money
back
on
behalf
of
the
individual
indian,
and
the
assertion
of
a
right
for
which
jackson
county
should
not
be
penalized.
the
lands
of
this
indian
and
the
lands
of
other
indians
had
become
part
of
the
economy
of
jackson
county,
which
we
believe,
crucial
and
in
part
of
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i'm
almost
there,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
it's
important,
and
i
think
moe
is
important.
i
think
we
need
to
have
the
history
up
to
moe,
because
the...
again,
the
tribe
and
the
government
say,
well,
it's
sort
of
the
eye--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
we
believe
that
moe...
sure,
moe--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
difference,
but
we
rely
on
both
parts
of...
the
clause
that...
what's
been
called
the
general
laws
clause
of
moe,
which
said
the
general,
civil,
and
criminal
laws
of
the
state,
is
exactly
the
same
clause
used
in
goudy
v.
meath.
we
believe
that
we
have
a
specific
provision
with
respect
to
tax
and
real
estate.
in
moe,
i
think
it's
significant
that
in
looking
at
the
district
court
opinion,
a
number
of
things
happen.
the
tribes
in
moe
could
have
asked
the
court
don't
impose
real
estate
property
tax,
but
they
did
not.
the
issue
in
moe
was
personal
property
tax.
it
was
vendor
license
fees
and
sales
taxes.
it
did
not
deal
with
real
property
tax.
and,
in
fact,
it's
clear
from
the
record,
if
you
look
again
at
a
footnote,
footnote
9
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
says...
and
remember
in
that
case
the
state
of
montana
tried
to
make
a
big
deal
about
how
much
money
we
pay
for
services
and
all
these
great
things
we're
doing
for
the
tribe
and
therefore,
just
do
away
with
their
laws,
which
we
feel
was
an
overbroad
approach.
but
the
trial
court
says--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
in
terms
of...
the
difference
is,
in
terms
of
the
taxing
authority
of
state
and
local
government.
we
have...
the
court,
in
moe,
you
don't
have
general
authority
to
impose
your
personal
property
tax.
this
court
has
said
that
we
are
going
to
limit
the
state's
ability
to
tax
indians
unless
there
is
a
specific
provision.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
absolutely,
absolutely.
and
i
think
it's
because
of
the
court's
requirement
that
the
taxing
authority
be
specific;
and
that
that
authority
has
been
upheld
by
the
court
since
that
period
of
time.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
that
the
rules
that
have
been
adopted
with
respect
to
the
relations
between
state
and
county
and
the
indian
tribes
could
be
more
clear,
yes.
i
would
agree.
i
think...
example...
let
me
give
an
example
that
i
think's
important
to
this
analysis.
the
government
concedes
that
the
only
way
they
can
collect
income
tax,
federal
income
tax,
is
because
of
this
provision,
section
6.
this
court,
in
squire
v.
capoeman
dealt
with
that
issue.
it
was
a
1956
case.
it
was
before
moe.
but
the
court
said,
you
can't...
the
government
was
trying
to
tax
the
proceeds
of
a
timber
sale
of
allotted
land
that
was
still
held
in
trust.
the
court
said,
you
can't
do
that.
the
government
said
that
provision...
that
provision
for
taxes
only
applies
to
state
and
local
government.
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
federal
government.
this
court
said
no,
it
applies
to
federal
income
tax
also.
without
that
authority,
i
submit,
if
the
court
were
to
say
no,
section
6
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
it
doesn't
authorize
tax
on
real
property,
that
you
also
eliminate
the
income
tax
ability
of
the
government
to
collect
the
income
tax
that
come
from
that
land.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
in
the--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
the
state
of
washington,
at
this
time,
does
not
have
an
inheritance
tax.
but,
for
example--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
part
of
that,
i
believe,
your
honor,
comes
from
public
law
280,
which
does
apply
in
the
yakima
reservation.
part
of
it
is
the
problem
of
the
tax...
the
real
estate
property
records
are
kept
at
the
county
courthouse,
which
would
include
all
the
fees.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
i
think
that's
all
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
absolutely.
we
are...
our
position
is,
however--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--that's
correct.
our
position
is,
with
respect
to
the
real
estate
excise
tax.
the
real
estate
excise
tax
that
the
ninth
circuit
struck
down
says
it's
an
excise
tax.
it's
covered
by
moe.
our
position
is
the
excise
tax
follows
the
sale
of
the
land.
it's
a
1
percent
tax
that
every
citizen
of
the
state
pays
when
a
piece
of
real
property
is
sold.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
correct.
they
called
it
an
excise
tax,
your
honor,
but
just
because
it's
an
excise
tax,
i
don't
believe
it's
covered
by
moe,
because
it's
more
analogous
to
income
tax
and
inheritance
tax,
which
this
court
has
upheld
as
proper
taxes.
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
this
court
said
it's
okay
for
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
collect
inheritance
tax
that
is
tied
to
fee
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
it
would
be...
the
analysis
is
is
that
the
income
tax,
the
capital
gains
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
increase
in
your
wealth.
and
therefore
it,
it
seems
to
me
is
more
analogous
to
the
income
tax...
it's
a
source
from
which
the
money
flows.
in
this
case,
it
flows
from
the
state.
well,
i
think
you're
right.
the
washington
supreme
court
might
well
have
said
that,
but
they
didn't.
aren't
we
bound
by
what
the
washington
supreme
court...
how
the
washington
supreme
court
characterized
it
in
that
phase
of
the
case?
we...
i
agree,
this
court
has...
is
agreed
that
it's
bound
in
terms
of...
by
the
washington
state
court...
the
supreme
court's
ruling
in
interpretation
of
its
own--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--we
submit
that
moe
has
answered
that
question.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
the
state
could
not
tax
that;
that
the
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--if
the
fee
land
is
owned
by
tribal
members,
our
position
would
be
that
that
could
be
taxed...
just
like
the
income
tax,
just
like
the
inheritance
tax.
if
it
comes
from
fee
land.
the
distinction
in
the
law,
the
distinction
that
was
made
by
the
allotment
act,
by
the
congress
in
subsequent
actions
with
respect
to
it,
have
continually
reiterated
that
point:
that
there
will
be
this
basic
distinction
between
trust
land
and
fee
land.
the
fact
is,
that
if
you
are
a
member
of
the
tribe,
or
the
tribe
itself,
and
you
don't
want
to
be
taxed,
all
you
have
to
do
is
put
your
land
in
trust.
you
know,
we
believe...
it's
that
simple.
the
court
has
said
that
alienability,
if--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
agree,
but
moe
did
not
deal
with
real
property.
the
tribe
could
have
raised
that
issue.
they
chose
not
to,
as
i
say.
in
fact,
the
district
court
relied
on
the
fact
that
those
taxes
were
being
paid,
and
pointed
it
out,
that
the
real
estate
taxes
were
be
paid...
were
being
paid.
and
we
get
to
this
very
narrow
construction,
i
suppose.
in
yakima
county,
as
the
other
counties,
for
100
and...
up
until
the
injunction
was
issued
in
this
case,
almost
100
years
or
a
little
over
100
years,
collected
these
taxes.
and
they
did
it
based
upon
the
statute.
congres
enacted
the
statute.
the
government...
excuse
me--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--we...
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
was
to
make
specific
reference
to
the
area
essentially
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
that
was
the...
the
land
owned
by
the
five
civilized
tribes,
so-called,
that
was...
had
been
treated
differently
by
the
various
statutes.
and
that
that
was
the
reason
for
that
proviso,
to
clarify
that
the
general
allotment
act
would
not
apply
to
that
group
of
american
indians.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's,
in
essence,
what
the
1
percent
real
estate
excise
tax
is,
your
honor.
and
yes...
all
i'm
relating
to
is
that
this
court,
in
squire
v.
capoeman,
said
that
if
it's
owned
in
fee,
and
there's
free
alienability,
that
the
tribal
member,
who
may
not
otherwise
have
to
pay
income
tax,
is
going
to
have
to
pay
it.
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
when
oklahoma
wanted
to
collect
a
million-and-some
dollars
worth
of
inheritance
tax
said
no,
you
can't
collect
all
of
it,
because
some
of
it
is
not
related
to
fee
lands.
that
part,
the
part
that's
related
to
trust
lands,
you
can't
collect.
the
part
that's
related,
the
income
you've
earned
from
the
fee
lands
can
be
taxed
by
the
state
of
oklahoma...
not
by
the
federal
government...
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
are
just
relating
that
it
seems
to
us,
that
these
cases
require
that,
in
fact,
the
tax
be
collected,
if
it's
owned
in
fee.
and
that
the
congress
has
said--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
squire
v.
capoeman
specifically
analyzed
the
proviso
and
said
that
if
it's
trust,
it's
not
going
to
be
taxed;
if
it's
fee,
it
will
be
taxed.
so
that,
it
seems
to
me,
that
to
the
extent
that
both
provisions...
and
i
say
both
provisions,
because
the
general
laws
clause
was
upheld
in
goudy,
and
i
think
you
can
distinguish
moe
on
the
basis
of
personalty,
as
opposed
to
real
property.
and
i
think
it's
a
valid
distinction.
it's
one
that
the
congress
made
early
on.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct...
as
interpreted
by
goudy.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
that's
correct.
and
again,
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
is...
written
in
1979,
was
of
the
same,
indicating
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
that
if
lands
are
held
in
fee,
they
would
be
taxed.
if
they
weren't
held
in
fee,
if
they
were
held
in
trust,
that
they
would
not.
the
cases
are--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
think
that
it
made
that
distinction
when
it
said
that
the
fee
lands
would
be
taxed;
and
has
never
passed
a
specific
statute
authorizing
the
tax
on
personalty.
i
mean,
because
that's...
at
least
from
a
state
and
local
government
perspective,
that's
how
we've
addressed
these--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--correct.
we
can't...
we
can't--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--not
based
on
this
court's
having
ruled
in
moe,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
yes,
if
you
don't
limit
moe
to
its
facts,
and
say
that
you
don't...
that
that
applies
to
all
taxes...
i
think
that,
again,
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
would
say
that
the
general,
criminal,
and
civil
laws
of
this
state
would
include
taxes.
but,
as
i
say,
the
court
has
taken
that
away
from
us.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
well,
we
believe
there
should
not
be,
and
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
missed--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--yes,
but
we
believe
so
by
its
opinion
saying
it
will
return
this
back
to
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
will
weigh
these
things
and
decide
whether
a
tax
should
be
imposed.
our
position
is,
is
the
court
here
has
established
a
per
se
rule
for
taxes.
it's
the
only
workable
kind
of
rule
for
taxes.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
no,
we
interpreted
the
circuit
court's
opinion
to
say
that
we're
going
to
send
it
back,
and
we're
going
to
do
an
analysis
of
the
entire
reservation,
and
maybe
parcel
by
parcel
to
decide
whether
the
taxes
should
be
imposed.
and
i
think
that's
why
both
the
government
and
the
tribe
and
ourselves
are
saying
we
need
a
per
se
rule,
either--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--that's
how
we
understood
it.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
bjur
indicated
that
he
believed
that
section
6
was
adopted
after
goudy.
our
reading
of
that
is...
is
different.
that
section
6
was,
in
fact,
adopted...
the
amendment
to
section
6
was
adopted
in
may
of
1906,
and
goudy
was
decided
in
november.
the
court
in
goudy
could
have
relied
on
the
second
proviso
but
chose
not
to...
in
fact,
relied
on
the
general
laws
provision
which
we
think
gives
it
a
stronger
meaning.
additionally,
i
think
one
of
the
questions
that
the
chief
justice
asked
points
out
the
problem
that
this
case
addresses:
when
was
the
statute
repealed?
policy
of
congress
has
gone
from
one
side
to
another.
after
the
ira,
after
the
so-called
repudiation
of
the
assimilation
policy,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
passed
public
law
280.
on
the
day
that
that
law
was
passed,
public
law
280,
the
congress
adopted
a
resolution
that
stated,
in
part,
the
policy
of
congress...
this
is
a
quotation
now...
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
make
indians
within
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states
subject
to
the
same
laws,
entitled
to
the
same
privilege
and
responsibilities
as
are
applicable
to
other
citizens
of
the
united
states,
and
to
end
their
status
as
wards
of
the
united
states
and
to
grant
them
all
of
the
rights
and
prerogatives
pertaining
to
american
citizenship.
we
submit
that
that
was
a
policy
change.
granted,
that
policy
has
now
been
changed
again.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
it
was
passed
in
1953.
i
don't
have
the
exact
date.
but
it
was
passed
some
19
years
after
the
indian
reorganization
act.
that
is
the
problem.
the
policy
of
congress
has
gone
from
one
side
to
the
other,
and
back
and
forth.
but
as
that
policy
has
changed,
this
statute,
providing
specifically
for
taxing
of
fee
lands,
has
never
changed.
it
has
remained
the
same.
this
issue
should
be
addressed
to
the
congress.
the
congress
should
decide...
all
of
the
counties,
many
of
the
counties
are
like
jackson
county,
kansas,
which
was
raised
in
that
1939
case.
these
taxes
have
become
a
part
of
the
economy
of
those
jurisdictions.
the
congress...
if
it
wants
to
say,
fee
lands
will
no
longer
be
taxed,
then
they
should
look
at
it
in
terms
of
testimony
and
determine
that
we're
going
to
replace
those
taxes,
much
as
they've
done
with
school
districts.
pass
an
in
lieu
tax.
what
kind
of
an
impact
is
this
going
to
have?
there's
an...
in
the
materials
that
were
submitted,
in
one
of
the
briefs,
with
respect
to
an
individual
county,
one
of
the
counties
in
south
dakota,
these
taxes
make
up
10
percent
of
the
county's
total
taxing
jurisdiction.
to
end
up
with
a
situation
that
the
tribes
and
the
government
are
asking
you
for
is
to
say
that
an
individual
indian
on
a
reservation
can
own
his
land;
he
can
mortgage
his
land;
he
cannot
pay
the
mortgage
and
his
land
could
be
sold
at
a
sale,
at
a
sheriff's--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--yes,
we
agree.
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
in
terms
of
this
court's
analysis
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--well,
through
this
court's
rulings,
by
saying
that,
in
fact,
the
general...
i
think
it
was
clear
to
the
congress
in
1906,
myself,
that
they
were
going
to
be
subject
to
all
taxes,
and
that
the
court
has
since...
since
that
time,
an
attempt
to
balance
and
interpret
the
way
congress
has
gone
back
and
forth
in
what
we
are
left
with
on
our
reservation.
if
the
court
has
said
we're
not
going
to
allow
taxation
on
these
reservations,
by
state
and
local
government
without
specific
authority...
and
in
this
case,
it
extended
even
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
c.
sullivan
--i
believe
in
mcclanahan.
i
think
it
was
in
mcclanahan
was
the
first
time
that
the
court
indicated
that,
in
looking
at
arizona's
income
tax,
that
they
were
a
state
income
tax
that
they
were
attempting
to
impose.
thank
you.
