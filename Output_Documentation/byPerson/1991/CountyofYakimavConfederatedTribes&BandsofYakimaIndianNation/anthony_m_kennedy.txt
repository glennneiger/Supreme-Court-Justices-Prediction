--what
about
a
timber
severance
tax
on
fee
land?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
quite
that...
so
you
don't
have
to
do
that
to
have
the
advantage
of
moe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
washington,
are
stamps
required
on
a
deed
when
it's
recorded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
the
deeds
routinely
recorded
in
the
office
of
the
yakima
county
recorder?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that
the
state
recording
statutes
apply?
there's
not
a
parallel
set
of
tribal
rules
on
recording,
are
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
no
conflict.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
washington
would
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
terms
of
sale
of
fee
lands
in
certain
respects...
to
the
exclusion
of
the
tribe,
with
respect
to
documentation,
the
signatures
that's
required
on
a
deed,
recording
requirements,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
moe
never
explicitly
distinguished
between
fee
lands
and
other
lands,
did
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
it
does
make
that
explicit
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
issue
was...
in
moe
was
the
general
policy...
general
powers
to
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
personal
property
tax.
but
it
never
addressed
a
tax
that
was
specifically
directed
to
fee
lands
only,
on
those
lands.
