justice
antonin
scalia
you
accept
it,
but
you
don't
really
agree
with
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
argument,
as
i
understood...
i
was
surprised
to
hear
what
you
said
earlier.
i
thought
you
were
just
arguing
that
because
of
the
proviso,
the
real
estate
can
be
taxed.
but
you
also
say
that
for
other
purposes,
the
real
estate
comes
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
for
purposes
of
inheritance,
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
taxes.
i'm
talking
about
what
happens
to
the
property
when
the
decedent
of
the
allotted
land
dies.
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
that
the
land
would
pass
according
to
state
law.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
how
do
you
get
that
in
the
proviso?
the
proviso
doesn't
say
anything
about
that.
it
says
sale,
encumbrance,
and
taxation.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
decide
that?
i
thought...
i...
frankly,
i
didn't
realize
this
until
you
said
it.
i
thought
we
were
just
talking
about
the
very
narrow
question
about
whether
the
state
can
tax
the
land.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
can
i
agree
that
the
state
can
tax
the
land
without
agreeing
that
the
land
passes
according
to
state
law,
that
the
state
can
do
all
sorts
of
other
things
with
respect
to
the
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
long
as
i
get
four
of
the
votes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
don't
we
have
to
follow
the
washington
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
this,
of
its
own
law
in
that
regard?
i
mean,
didn't
state...
didn't
they
just
rely
on
what
the
state
supreme...
how
the
state
supreme
court
described
the
excise
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
washington
supreme
court
says
that
tax
upon
the
sales
of
property
is
not
a
tax
upon
the
subject
matter
in
that
sale.
so
how
can
you
say
it's
a
real
estate
tax?
i
mean,
if
it's
a
matter
of
state
law,
i
don't
understand
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sullivan,
as
i
understand
your
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
do
i
understand
it
correctly
that
you
say
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
tax
on
the
land
or
not,
that
any
tax
that
is
what...
that
is
related
to
the
land?
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
state
could
impose
a
sales
tax
on
the
land,
too;
impose
a
tax
upon
real
estate
sales
with
respect
to
this
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
trying
to
distinguish
this
situation
from
moe.
and
the
device
you're
using
is
the
proviso,
as
i
understand
it.
without
the
proviso
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
this
from
moe.
the
proviso,
however,
doesn't
say
taxes
relating
to
such
land,
but
it
says
taxation
of
said
land.
it
says
taxation
of
said
land.
so
you
have
to
be
taxing
the
land
to
come
within
the
proviso,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
distinguish
it
on
that
ground.
but
there's
no
basis
in
the
law
for
distinguishing
it
on
that
ground,
that
the
basis
in
the
law
that
you
give
us,
that
you
entice
is
with,
is
the
proviso.
and
the
proviso
says,
taxation
of
said
land.
but
you
rely
on
both
provisos
i
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he
said
that
we
really
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
relieved
at
but.
[laughter]
what
about
the
sale
or
to
transfer
title?
whose
law
would
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
moe,
if
we
had
found
the
personal
property...
a
personal
property
tax
could...
should...
could
be
imposed,
we
would
have
had
to
find
that
the
entirety
of
the
state...
of
the
state's
law
would
also
apply.
there
was
no
basis
for
distinguishing
personal
property
taxes
from
the
remainder
of
state
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
situation,
the
checkerboard
problem
we
were
concerned
about
in
moe
is
a
serious
problem,
as
the
federal
assimilative
crime
act
demonstrates.
the
federal
government,
which
owns
real
estate
all
around,
doesn't
try
to,
you
know,
have
separate
laws,
in
a
checkerboard
fashion
within
the
various
states.
so
that
was
a
real
concern
in
moe.
but
gee,
running
a
checkerboard
system
of
real
estate
is
not
very
difficult.
don't
we
have
that
same
situation
with
respect
to
federal
lands
owned
within
the
states?
the
states
can
tax
other
lands,
but
they
can't
tax
the
federal
lands.
so
what's
the
big
deal
about
checkerboarding
as
far
as
real
estate
taxation
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
cause
the
statute
says
so.
but
i
mean,
there's
no
serious
implementation
problem,
as
there
is
when
you
have...
when
you
have
people
in
one
relatively
small
area
all
subject
to
different
criminal
and
civil
laws
on
the
basis
of
which
parcel
of
land
they
happen
to
be
on.
and
that
would
be
very
strange.
but
i
don't
see
anything
so
strange
about
allowing
a
state
to
tax
some
parcels
and
not
to
tax
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
they
didn't
have
the
proviso.
i
mean,
if
you
said
personal
property
taxes
could
be
imposed
on
as
a
checkerboard-pattern
basis,
i
think
you'd
have
to
say
all
laws,
quote,
"both
civil
and
criminal"
would
be
applicable
on
the
same
checkerboard
basis.
and
that
would
have
been
a
real...
a
real
problem,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
doesn't
say...
it
doesn't
say
and
thereafter,
all
restrictions
imposed
hereunder
as
to
sale,
encumbrance,
or
taxation
shall
be
removed.
it
says
all
restrictions.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
yakima
county,
washington
imposes
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
taxable
real
estate
within
its
jurisdiction,
and
also
an
excise
tax
on
sales
of
real
estate.
the
yakima
indian
nation
instituted
this
action
seeking
a
declaration
that
these
taxes
could
not
lawfully
be
imposed
with
respect
to
so-called
fee-patented
lands
held
by
the
yakima
indian
nation
or
by
individual
members
of
that
nation
within
the
bounds
of
the
yakima
indian
reservation,
and
also
seeking
an
injunction
prohibiting
those
taxes.
fee-patented
lands
are
parcels
that
were
once
held
in
trust
for
the
tribe
but
that
had
been
granted
by
the
united
states
to
individual
indians,
and
often
later
conveyed
to
non-indians
under
a
policy
to
divide
up
the
reservations
that
was
in
effect
between
1887
and
1934.
the
district
court
held
that
both
taxes
were
barred
by
federal
law
and
granted
the
tribe
the
relief
it
sought.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
it
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
federal
law
enjoined
the
sales
tax
but
held
that
the
ad
valorem
property
tax
would
be
impermissible
only
if
it
would
have
a
demonstrably
serious
impact
on
the
tribe's
political
integrity,
economic
security,
or
health
and
welfare.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
indian
general
allotment
act
of
1887
as
amended
explicitly
permits
yakima
county
to
impose
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
reservation
land
patented
in
fee
pursuant
to
that
act
and
owned
by
reservation
indians
or
by
the
tribe
itself,
but
that
federal
law
does
not
allow
the
county
to
enforce
its
excise
tax
on
sales
of
the
land.
the
contention
of
the
tribe
and
its
principal
amicus
the
united
states,
at
this
explicit
statutory
confer
of
taxing
power,
has
been
repudiated
by
subsequent
indian
legislation
rests
upon
a
misunderstanding
of
this
court's
precedents
particularly
moe
versus
confederated
tribes
and
upon
a
misperception
of
the
structure
of
the
indian
general
allotment
act.
we
modify
the
court
of
appeals'
remand
order
to
the
district
court
however,
or
we
do
not
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
county's
power
to
enforce
its
ad
valorem
property
tax
is
qualified
by
any
consideration
of
the
purported
effect
of
the
tax
on
the
tribe's
political
integrity,
economic
security,
or
health
and
welfare.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
