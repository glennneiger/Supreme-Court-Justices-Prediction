mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
no
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
the
general
principles
of
preemption
in
indian
law
that
govern
this
case.
those
principles,
which
are
rooted
in
both
ancient
treaties
and
current
federal
statutes,
provide
that
state
taxation
of
indian
activities
and
property
on
a
reservation
is
preempted,
unless
congress
carves
out
an
exception
to
that
rule
in
unmistakably
clear
terms.
we
submit
that
on
the
question
in
which
the
parties
are
in
a
disagreement...
whether
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
permits
the
taxation
here...
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
moe
controls.
in
moe,
the
court
found
untenable
the
argument
that
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
allowed
the
state
of
montana
to
tax
activities
with
respect
to
indians
who
had
received
fee
allotments
as
contemplated
in
section
6...
including
personal
property--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
not
real
property.
in
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice,
though,
it
follows
a
fortiori
for
several
reasons
from
that
conclusion,
and
that
construction
of
section
6.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
insofar
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
concerned,
the
first
time
i'm
aware
that
we
looked
at
it
is
the
first
time
that
we
were
asked
to
look
at
it,
which
was
in
connection
with
filing
the
court
of...
an
amicus
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
was...
there
was
a...
an
opinion
by
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
department
which
has
since
been
repudiated...
i
think
it's
the
use
of
the
word
solicitor,
that
it
wasn't
clear...
it
was
an
opinion
of
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
department
in
1979
that
did
not
give
that
construction
to
moe
with
respect
to
real
property
taxes.
but
the
interior
department
has
now
over-ruled
that
decision.
there
are
several
reasons
why
we
believe
that...
ah...
moe
controls
in
this
case.
but
first
let
me...
let
me
explain
the
two...
there
are
two
separate
theories,
or
bases
for
an
immunity
from
taxation
that
are
at
issue
here,
and
it's
important
to
keep
them
distinct.
under
section
5
of
the
general
allotment
act,
allotments
made
to
individual
indians
were
held
in
trust.
although
section
5
did
not
expressly
say
so,
this
court's
decision
in
rickert
held
that
a
state
could
not
tax
the
allotment
while
it
was
held
in
trust.
the
principle
was,
that
the
trust
allotment
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government,
in
furtherance
of
the
policy
of
carrying-out
the
allotment
of
lands
under
the
allotment
act.
it
was
designed
to
protect
only
the
individual
indian,
to
give
him
a
period
of
preparation,
at
the
conclusion
of
which
he
would
be
fully
assimilated
into
the
larger
society.
the
rule
of
preemption,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
is
something
quite
different.
it
turns
on
the
statutes
and
treaties
governing
the
reservation
and
tribal
affairs.
it
does
not
turn
on
the
tax
immunity
of
an
individual
indian.
and
the
court
drew
that
very
distinction
in
moe,
itself,
where
it
said...
in
the
jurisdictional
part
of
the
court's
holding...
that
the
tax
immunity
at
issue
here
is
one
of
preemption,
based
on
treaties
and
statutes,
not
based
on
the
federal
instrumentality
doctrine
which
has
since
been
repudiated.
with
that
in
mind,
it
becomes
quite
clear
the
way
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
operates.
the
principal
clause
of
section
6
that
was
at
issue
in
this
court's
decision
in
moe,
affirmatively
declared
that
when
an
indian
received
a
fee
patent,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trust
period,
he
shall
have
the
benefit
and
be
subject
to
all
provisions
of
state
law.
in
goudy
v.
meath,
the
court
held
that
that
included
state
tax
law.
and
that,
of
course,
was
consistent
with
the
design
of
the
general
allotment
act,
which
was
that
individual
indians
would
receive
their
own
allotment
and
be
assimilated
into
the
larger
society,
and
therefore
be
subject
to
state
law.
but
in
moe,
this
court
held
that
section
6
did
not
have
the
present
effect
of
allowing
the
taxation
of
personal
property
on
indian
reservations,
that
that
was
untenable
in
light
of
subsequent
developments:
the
enactment
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
which
repudiated
the
allotment
policy,
and
its
goals
of
breaking
up
tribes
and
tribal
relations.
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
enactment
of
18
u.s.c.
1151
and
the
definition
of
1948
and
was
inconsistent
with
the
regulation...
the
comprehensive
regulation
of
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
in
public
law
280.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
did
not...
it
did
not,
because,
again,
let
me...
because
of
the
distinction
i
was
drawing.
goudy
and
the
first
clause
of
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
had
the
effect
of
removing
the
instrumentality
doctoring
immunity,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
united
states
holding
the
land
in
trust.
it
was
an
immunity
that
really
derived
from
the
united
states'
interest
in
the
individual
allotment.
moe,
however,
discussed
the
preemption
rationale.
and
if
we
look
at
that
tax...
or
the
proviso
to
section
6,
it
becomes
clear,
looking
at
the
language
of
it,
why
this
does
not
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
preemption.
what
the
proviso
says
is
that
the
secretary
may
accelerate
the
time,
essentially,
to
grant
a
fee
patent,
if
he
concludes
that
the
individual
indian
is
capable
of
managing
his
own
affairs.
well,
the
premise
obviously
is
removing
the
federal
protection
instrumentality
rationale
for
the
tax
exemption.
then
it
says
all
restrictions
as
to
sale,
encumbrance,
or
taxation
of
said
land
shall
be
removed.
now,
first
of
all,
the
word
5
of
the
general
allotment
act
by
virtue
of
the
land
being
held
in
trust.
furthermore,
the
use
of
the
word
"remove"
indicates
that
what
the
statute
was
speaking
to
were
those
restrictions
that
were
in
place
at
the
time...
those
that
were
already
attached
to
the
land.
when
lifted,
the
indian
would
become
part
of
the
indian
community...
of
the
non-indian
community.
so
in
those
respects,
all
that
section
6's
proviso
does
when
a
patent
issues
at
an
accelerated
rate,
si
to
subject...
is
to
remove
whatever
restrictions
are
in
the
general
allotment
act,
itself,
to
taxation.
but
it
does
not
speak
to
the
broader
question
of
preemption
of
state
tax--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
a
rule
of
preemption,
under
this
court's
cases
derived
from
statutes
and
treaties
is
not
commonly...
the
word
restrictions
is
not
commonly
used
to
describe
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that's
exactly
the
rationale
the
court
adopted
in
moe.
and
that
is
that
moe--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no...
what
the...
not
with
respect
to
separate
tax
immunities
as
such.
but
what
the
court
said
in
moe
was
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
goudy
had
said
state
tax
laws
are
part
of
the
laws
to
which
the
indian...
the
allottee
become
subject,
the
court
said
that
does
not
apply.
it's
not
an
applied
repeal.
section
6
remains
in
effect.
and
if
you
have
an
off-reservation
allotment,
the...
section
6
has
the
effect
of
subjecting
that
allotment
to
state
tax
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it's
not...
with
all
respect,
justice
white,
it's
not.
because
at
the
time
it
was
written,
it
was
part
of
the
allotment
policy
during
which
individual
allotments
were
to
pass
into
the
broader
society.
as
this
court
said
in
moe,
that
was
repudiated
by
the
general
allotment
act...
not
just
the
allotment
policy,
but
the...
excuse
me...
by
the
ira.
the
ira's
purpose
was
to
reestablish
the
tribes,
and
therefore
to
reinstate
the
premise
of
the
kansas
indian--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--precisely,
justice
white,
and
was
not...
it
was
the
reinstatement
of
the
prior
regime,
prior
to
the
general
allotment
act.
it
reinvoked
the
rule
of
the
kansas
indians,
which
this
court
reiterated
in
montana
v.
blackfeet
tribe,
which
is
once
the
tribe
is
recognized
by
the
political
departments
as
separate
and
self-governing...
as
this
one
is...
and
set-aside
on
its
own
land,
it's
a
tribe,
and
its
members
are
immune
from
taxation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct;
there
was.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right...
and
even
after
the
ira,
with
respect
to
lands
outside
of
reservations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
may
continue
to
do
so.
that's
why
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--exactly,
which
is
what
the
court
held
in
moe.
and
it's
not
just
a
change
in
direction
by
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
did
not
repeal
it.
because
the
individual...
because
all
the
section
6
spoke
to
was
the
instrumentality
doctrine
tax
immunity,
which
was
individual.
but
as
this
court
said
in
moe,
the
tax
immunity
here
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
self-governing
tribe,
including
its
members.
and
it's
not
just
a...
a
change
in
policy.
there
were
specific
statutes,
later
enacted,
that
had
this
effect...
including
the
ira,
including
the
redefinition
of
1948.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
