justice
byron
r.
white
when
are
you
going
to
get
to
moe?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
yeah.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
at
the
very
minimum,
you
want
to
limit
moe
to
its
facts,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
difference
between
the
clause
that
was
relied
on
in
moe
and
the
clause
that
you
rely
on
here,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you...
in
terms
of
the
rationale
and
the
reasoning
of...
in
moe,
why
is
there
a
difference
between
personal
and
real
property
owned
by
indians
within
a
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
state
may
tax
indian-held
fee
land
on
a
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that
same
indian
had
personal
property
on
that
same
piece
of
real
estate,
you
accept
moe's
decision
that
the
state
may
not
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
about
a
sales
tax
on
the
sale
of
personal
property
that,
itself,
can't
be
taxed?
justice
byron
r.
white
what,
that
no...
the
state
could
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
one
that
was
at
issue
in
moe.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
you
should
win
even
if
the
last
proviso...
if
the
tax
proviso
wasn't
even
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did...
you
said
the
congress
has
made
the
distinction
between
personalty
and
realty?
when
did
it
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
you
are...
there
you
really
are
relying
on
your
tax
proviso?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
win
under
just
the
other
proviso,
on
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
must
get
to
the
other
proviso.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
much
clearer
can
you
be
than
to
say
that...
that
under
certain
circumstances
the...
any
restrictions
on
the
taxation
of
land
shall
expire?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
you
make
it
clearer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
just
say
it
again,
and
i
really
mean
it?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
shall
be
removed.
it
says,
all
restrictions
to
sale
encumbrance
or
taxation
of
said
land
shall
be
removed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
now
you're
getting
into
something
else.
what
would
you
say
if
moe
had
never
been
decided?
how
clear
would
that
be
in--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
think
the...
you
think
the...
the
later
statutes
really
repeal
the
general
allotment
act,
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes...
or
this
part
of...
at
least
this
part
of
section
349?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
or
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't
have
two
statutes
existing...
regulating
the
same
subject
in
a
contradictory
way.
isn't
one
of
them
going
to
cover
it,
and
the
other
one,
if
it
doesn't
cover
it,
it's
been
repealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
moe
really
just
overruled
goudy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it...
it
seems
very
strange
to
say
that
the
section
349
said
all
these
restrictions
would
be
removed
and
the
states
may
tax
land,
but
you
say
they
can't
because
there's
another
restriction
that
hasn't
been
removed...
preemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
really
saying
there
later
arose
a
preemption
policy--
justice
byron
r.
white
--which
intervened.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
there
was
a
time
between
the
general
allotment
act
and
preemption,
where
there
wasn't
any
preemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
and...
in
that
period
of
time,
states
were
permitted
to
tax
by
virtue
of
the
general
allotment
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
preemption
policy,
wherever
it
came
from,
in
effect
overturned
the
state's
authority
to
tax
pursuant
to
section
6.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that...
so
you
don't
say
that
repealed
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
the
government
when
it
says...
when
they
say
that
you
do
agree
with
the
preemption
submission
in
the
sense
that
you
can't
tax
unless
congress
says
so,
specifically?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
that...
has
that
always
been
the
rule,
forever
and
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
says
that
after
the
general
allotment
act,
some
preemption
principle
suddenly
arose.
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that
the...
when
was
that...
when
did
this
court
first
say
that?
