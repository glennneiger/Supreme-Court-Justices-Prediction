justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question
on
another
subject
before
you
sit
down?
your
first
question
in
your
cert
petition
referred
to
brendale
and
the
problem
with
deciding
whether
something's
in
the
closed
area
or
the
open
area.
i
didn't
understand
that
issue
to
be
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
could
you
help
me
out?
to
what
extent
is
there
a
brendale
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
inject
the
brendale
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
your
position,
but
i
didn't...
couldn't...
you...
i'm
just
not
sure
i
understood
the
disposition
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was,
in
your
view,
they
in
effect
said
if
it's
in
the
closed
area,
it
cannot
be
taxed,
but
if
it's
in
the
open
area
it
can
be,
or
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--xxx
wants
that.
i
didn't
really
understand
them
to
have
xxx
that.
but
that's
what...
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
beginning
you
said
you
were
relying
on
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
nation.
are
the
provisions
you've
relied
on
set
forth
in
your
brief?
i
didn't
find
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
quotes
from
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
but
that
would
mean
they
couldn't
have
even
conveyed
them
to
non-indians.
and
they
did.
and
there's
a
big
question
about
that.
