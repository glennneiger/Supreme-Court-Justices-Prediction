william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-408,
county
of
yakima
v.
confederate
tribes
and
bands
of
the
yakima
nation,
and
90-577,
vice
versa.
mr.
sullivan,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sullivan.
mr.
bjur,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
if
the...
if
the
act
of
congress...
if
we
were
to
find
an
act
of
congress
that
authorized
the
imposition
of
these
real
property
taxes,
and
it
was
after
the
treaty,
then
if
your...
your
construction
of
the
treaty
would
be
abrogated
to
that
effect,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
treaty
doesn't
govern
over
a
later
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
if
it
did
provide
unambiguously
for
state
taxation,
the
treaty
would
be
abrogated?
it
doesn't
have
to
mention
the
treaty,
sir.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily...
ordinarily,
simply
a
change
of
direction
on
the
part
of
congress,
so
that
congress
is
doing
things
differently
in
the
are
of
indian
relations
now
than
it
did
earlier
doesn't
repeal
an
express
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
rule
against
implied
repeals?
can
you
point
to
something
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
that...
that
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
proviso?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
rule
against
implied
repeals
govern?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bjur.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
real
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
did
the
solicitor
general
or
the
justice
department
adopt
that
view
of
moe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
government
is...
the
government
has
maintained
the
same
position
since
it
first
addressed--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
certainly...
i
wrote
moe,
and
i
certainly
don't
agree
with--
[laughter]
--with
that
interpretation
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
did--
--that's
a
very
strange
reading
of
moe.
--they
certainly
wasted
a
lot
of
effort
writing
that
statute.
it's
just
a
meaningless
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sullivan,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
public
law
280
passed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sullivan.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.

of
yakima

confederated
tribes
and
bands
