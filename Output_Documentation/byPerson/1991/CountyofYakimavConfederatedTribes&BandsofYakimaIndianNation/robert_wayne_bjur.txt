mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
thing
that
i
would
like
to
do
is
address
an
argument
made
by
mr.
sullivan
in
response
to
questioning
from
this
court.
mr.
sullivan
asserts
that
fee
land
owned
by
a
yakima
member
on
the
reservation
would
be
subject
to
state
law
in
the
event
that
tribal
member
was
to
pass
away.
that's
not
the
case
on
the
yakima
reservation.
and
on
behalf
of
the
yakima
nation,
i
strongly
disagree
with
that
assertion.
it
was
less
than
2
short
years
passed,
when
mr.
sullivan
stood
before
this
court
and
conceded,
in
oral
argument,
that
yakima
county
had
no
authority
to
zone
land
owned
by
fee
members
on
the
yakima
indian
reservation.
now
how
mr.
sullivan
can
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
yakima
county
now
has
authority
to
provide
for
the
descent
and
distribution
of
that
land
just
simply
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
that's
true,
but
it's--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--well,
on
the
yakima
reservation,
tribal
law
and
state
law
is
concurrent.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
conflict
between
tribal
law
and
state
law
on
the
laws
on...
effecting
a
sale.
the
only
provision
that...
of
state
law
that
would
not
apply
would
be
the
real
estate
excise
tax.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
no,
that's
not
part
of
the
tribal
law
and
order
code.
the
tribe
doesn't
restrict
those
sales.
however,
the
tribe
does
restrict
its
own
sales
of
fee
land.
that
is
done
in
accordance
with
policies
and
procedures
agreed
upon
with
the
united
states
government,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
they
used
to
be
but
they're
not
now.
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
that
the
excise
tax
has
been
accounted
for,
one
way
or
another.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
yes,
deeds
are
recorded.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
no,
there's
no
conflict
between
tribal
law
and
state
law
with
regard
to
recording
requirements.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
that
question
hasn't
come
up.
i
would
disagree.
if
the
tribe
did
take
a
position
and
passed
laws
regulating
the
transfer
of
fee
property
by
a
tribal
member
within
the
boundaries
of
the
yakima
indian
reservation,
the
tribal
law
would
control,
for
the
fee...
for
the
tribal
members.
one
thing
that
needs
to
be
remembered
in
this
proceeding
is
what...
what's
at
stake
here.
this
action
was
instituted
by
the
yakima
nation
in
response
to
the
foreclosure
and
the
pending
tax
sales
of
the
lands
and
homes
of
31
members
of
the
tribe.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
these
taxes
were...
demonstrably
serious,
impacting
upon
the
tribe's
political
integrity,
the
economic
security,
and
health
and
welfare.
also,
this
issue
is
very,
very
important
to
the
yakima
nation
because
of
its
conflict
and
its
threat
to
the
treaty
with
the
yakimas.
the
treaty
with
the
yakimas,
which
we've
addressed
in
our
brief,
provides
that
the
lands
of
the
yakima
indian
reservation
are
for
the
exclusive
use
and
benefit
of
the
yakima
nation
and
its
members.
this
is
a
treaty
provision
that
remains
intact.
it
has
not
been
abrogated.
these
taxes,
the
efforts
by
yakima
county
to
impose
real
estate
property
taxes
on
the
fee
lands
of
yakima
members
conflicts
directly
with
the
treaty.
it...
they
cannot
be
permitted.
they're
invalid
in
my--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--well--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--in
order
to
abrogate
the
treaty,
it
is
my
understanding
of
this
court's
decisions
on
that,
the
abrogation
has
to
be
clear
and
specific.
section
34...
25
u.s.c.
349,
section
6
of
the
allotment
act
does
not
provide
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
by
congress
to
abrogate
these
treaty
rights.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
no,
i
agree
that
that's
the
status
of
the
law.
if
it
was
clear
and
unambiguous
that
abrogation
was
intended,
this
court
has
issued
opinions
that
would
permit
it.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
i
believe
that
that's
not
clear.
what
the
proviso
says--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--well,
i
would
make
it
clearer
by
saying,
and--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--no,
when
the
fee
patent
is
issued,
this
land
shall
be
subject
to
state
taxation.
that's
not
what's
said.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
but
that
statute
was
passed...
or
the
proviso
was
passed
in
1906
at
the
height
of
the
assimilation
and
allotment
era.
this
court
in
moe
has--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--if
moe...
to
me,
moe
is
the
logical
extension
of
mcclanahan,
mescalero,
the
kansas
indians,
bryan
v.
itasca
county...
all
those
cases
that
i've
mentioned
would
support
the
position
that
we
bring
to
this
court
today.
moe
is
very
helpful,
no
doubt.
moe
is
the
basis--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--well--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--i
don't
use
the
word
repeal.
i
prefer
to
use
the
words
repudiated,
as
the
court
used
in
moe.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
what
the
court...
what
this
court
has
done,
particularly
in
moe,
is
looked
to
the
policies
behind
the
allotment
and
assimilation
legislation.
those
policies
no
longer
exist.
they've
been
completely
replaced
and
totally
repudiated.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
this
is
the
enactment
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
legislation
thereafter
wasn't
a
change
in
direction.
it
was
a
180-degree
opposite
situation.
instead
of
assimilating
and
ending--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--no,
i
can't.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
no,
ah--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--because
i
can't
point
to
anything
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
that
says
directly
repeals
or
contradicts
the
main
provision
of
25
u.s.c.
349
which
provides
that
on
the
issuance
of
a
patent
in
fee,
the
allottee
shall
be
subject
to
the
general
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
in
the
state
in
which
that
allottee
resides.
and
yet
moe
teaches
us
that
that
has
been...
that's
inconsistent.
that
is
no
longer
appropriate.
it's
invalid.
so
the
same
logic
applies
to
this
issue.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
no,
the
tribe
would
have
authority
to
impose
its
taxes
on
fee
lands.
but
the
tribe
has
chosen
not
to
tax
any
of
the
lands
owned
by
tribal
members.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
except
this
court
has
said,
to
give
states
taxing
jurisdiction
over
indian
tribes
and
their
people
require...
requires
a
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
on
congress'
part
to
effect...
effectfully--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--well,
what
goudy
held--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--that's
true.
in
1906
at
the
height
of
the
allotment
and
assimilation
period,
this
court
held
that
taxing
jurisdiction
was
one
of
the
general
civil
jurisdictions
that
the
allottee
became
subject
to
when
he
received
his
patent.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
that's
right.
the
goudy
decision
was
made
before
the
adoption
of
the
burke
act
proviso.
so
the
court
in
goudy
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
that
other
language.
it
relied
on
the
general
jurisdictional
grant
contained
in
the
main
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
yes,
it
did,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
the--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--but
the
opinion
in
moe
provides
that
even
on
fee
lands,
the
general
taxing
authority
for
personal
property
taxes
in
the
state
of
montana
does
not
exist.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
no,
it
did
not
address
that
in
moe.
but
the
logic
of
moe
applies.
if
the
ability
to
tax
a
car
that
an
indian
person
owns
on
fee
lands
reduces
the
size
of
the
flathead
reservation,
surely
the
ability
to
impose
the
property
tax
takes
away
the
size
of
the
reservation
to
the
yakima
people.
the
yakima
indian
reservation
is
the
homeland
of
the
yakima
people.
and
i
believe
that
congress
has
dictated
that
all
of
the
reservation
lands
should
be
home
to
these
people...
including
the
fee
lands,
which
brings
into
play
congress
adopting
the
indian
country
definition
at
18
u.s.c.
1151.
the
yakima
nation
believes
that
this
statute
is
significant
because
it
clarified
that
indian
country
was
to
include
fee
lands.
this
was
in
doubt
on
many
reservations
before
congress
did
this.
i
believe
that
this
particular
statute
was
important
to
the
court's
decision
in
moe.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
it's
significant
because
why
should
one
yakima
member
have
to
pay
taxes
to
a
jurisdiction
that
he
pays
no
other
taxes
to,
on
one
parcel
of
land,
while
the
other
yakima
member
not
have
to
pay
taxes?
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
that's
true,
but
that
same
distinction
could
have
been
made
in
moe.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
i
would
argue
that
the
proviso
wasn't
intended
to
be
that
dramatic.
the
proviso
was
something
that
congress
passed,
and
still
fell
within
the
limits
of
the
general
jurisdictional
grant
contained
at
the
beginning
of
349.
i
would
like
to
point
out...
i'm
running
out
of
time...
but
point
out
to
this
court
to
consider
the
argument
that
we've
made
on
the
state
disclaimer
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
disclaimer
language
had
been
waived
by
congress,
or
congress
had
consented
to
it
by
349.
again,
congress
did
not
contemplate,
when
it
adopted
349
that
indian
tribes
would
be
flourishing,
and
that
the
reservation
system
would
continue
to
exist
at
the
end
of
the
25-year
trust
period.
and
i
would
also
like
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
excise
tax.
there's
no
reason
to
distinguish
that
excise
tax
from
the
taxes
that
this
court
has
struck
down
in
the
other
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
sure.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
the...
my
brief--
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
--quotes
those
provisions.
the
treaty
is
12
stat.
951,
where
it
describes
the
10.8
million
acres
that
the
tribe
gave
up
and
provided
basically
the
tax
base
for
the
rest
of
central
washington.
the
next
section
goes
on
to
provide
that...
describe
the
lands
that
would
be
in
the
reservation,
and
it
says
these
lands
shall
be
for
the
exclusive
use
and
benefit
of
the
yakima
nation.
mr.
robert
wayne
bjur
well,
the
general
allotment
act
was
the
beginning
of
an
effort
to
abrogate
that.
but
the
general
allotment
act
did
not
go
to
fruition.
congress
saw
the
error
of
that
in...
and
halted
allotment
and
assimilation
before
it
became
finalized.
the
treaty
provision
was
not
abrogated.
it
still
remains
in
force.
