justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
on
land
within
a
reservation,
where
a
fee
title
is
held
by
an
indian
member
of
the
tribe,
but
it
was
patented
and
the
title
was
issued;
and
if
that
land
is
later
transferred,
does
state
law
govern
what
it
takes
to
make
a
transfer
and
pass
title?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
about
if
the
owner
were
to
die
without
leaving
a
will,
what
law
would
govern
the
passage
of
that
land?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
owner
is
a
tribal
member.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
there
been
cases
involving
that,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
again.
but
the
statute
in
question,
section
349,
refers
to
at
the
expiration
of
the
trust
period.
now,
when
did
the
trust
period
expire
here?
do
we
know
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
were
the
patents
issued
during
the
trust
period
or
after
the
trust
period?
and
does
the
record
tell
us
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
might
make
a
difference
if
the
statute
only
applies
to
lands
patented
during
the
trust
period,
or
to
lands
patented
at
the
expiration
of
the
trust
period.
at
least
there's
language
in
that
section
that
may
make
it
relevant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
what
does
the
last
proviso
of
this
statute
mean,
where
it
says:
and
provided
further,
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
not
extend
to
any
indians
in
the
former
indian
territory.
what's
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
tribe
restricted
the
transferability
of
lands
owned
in
fee
by
tribal
members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
necessarily
inconsistent
to
say
that
both
the
indian
tribe
could
tax
the
land
as
well
as
the
state
and
county?
i
mean,
we
often
have
parallel
systems
of
taxation
out
there.
is
there
anything
necessarily
consistent
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
even
if
the
tribe
did
choose
to
tax,
it
wouldn't
be...
it
wouldn't
mean
that
there
couldn't
be
another
taxing
jurisdiction
that
also
had
that
power.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
this
court
in
that
early
goudy
case
thought
it
was
clear
enough.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
section
349.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
said
that
by
virtue
of
the
language
to
that
effect
in
section
349.
