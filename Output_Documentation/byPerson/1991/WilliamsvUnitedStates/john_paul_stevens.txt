justice
john
paul
stevens
it
tells
you
that
you
should
remand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
read
that,
keep
in
mind
the
language
at
the
bottom
of
81,
that
the
sentence
may
be
upheld
if
there
are
proper
factors
that
standing
alone
would
justify
the
departure,
which
i
take
to
mean
in
their
opinion
would
justify
the
departure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
defend
the
rationale
of
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
have
something
clearly
in
mind?
under...
however
we
come
out
on
as
a
result
of,
whether
you
say
that
the
defendant
has
to
prove
that
it
was
the
result
of,
or
the
government
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
same
sentence
would
have
been
imposed
anyway,
it
still
is
true
that
the
first
thing
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
do
is
answer
the
as
a
result
of
inquiry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
until
they
do
that
they
don't
get
to
the
reasonable
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
this
case
they
did
not
answer
the
as
a
result
of...
at
least
one
could
read
the
opinion
as
not
having
answered
that
inquiry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
they
did,
i
understand.
but
if
they
did
they
really
didn't
have
to
talk
about
reasonableness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
did
talk
about
reasonableness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
an
(f)(1).
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
so
what
you're
saying
is
the
defendant
really
has
two
chances
of
winning.
one
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--proving
it
was
not
a
result
of,
or
alternatively
saying
it's
unreasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
i
understand.
