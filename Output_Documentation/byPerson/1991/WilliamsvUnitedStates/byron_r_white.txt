justice
byron
r.
white
--but
the
factors,
the
factors
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
were
not
among
the
factors
that
the
district
court
referred
to.
you've
got
two
questions,
mr.
hanson.
why
don't
you
answer
justice
scalia's
first
and
then
answer
justice
blackmun's.
i'm
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
says
elsewhere,
the
record
is
replete
with
convictions,
and
even
if
we
count
to
but
5
felony
convictions
the
court
has
the
belief
that
the
10
points
assessed
is
insufficient
for
the
5
felonies,
2
of
which
are
outside
the
15-year
parameters.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they,
up
above
they
said,
at
the
top
of
82,
they
said
therefore
we
shall
examine
the
other
factors
that
the
district
court
considered
in
deciding
to
depart
upward.
so...
and
they
say
that
there
were
enough
factors,
that
the
court
below
made
a
correct
decision
even
with
the
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court,
the
court
heads
that
paragraph
up
as,
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
section
is
entitled
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
say
the
court
decided
the
same
decision
would
have
been
handed
down
anyway.
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
brand
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
we
cannot
say
the
consideration
of
these
two
convictions
as
part
of
the
overall
assessment
was
inappropriate.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
said
the
previous
arrests
without
convictions
were
not
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
wax,
here
the
factors
that
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
were
all
factors
that
the
judge
himself
relied
upon--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
the
departure.
now
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
says
well,
there
are
other
factors
in
the
record
that
the
judge
didn't
say
he
was
relying
on,
but
we
can
do
the
judge's
job
as
well
as
he
can.
we'll
use
these
other
factors
and
say
that
there
was,
with
these
factors
which
the
judge
didn't
rely
on
there
was
ample
basis
for
the
departure.
i
take
it
you're
not
urging,
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
there's
no
doubt
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
the,
here
are
a,
b,
and
c
that
the
district
court
relied
on,
he
shouldn't
have,
that
there
was
error,
the
district
judge
committed
error
in
relying
on
those
particular
factors.
and
without...
and
the
other
factors
that
he
relied
on
were
not
sufficient
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
that
he
actually
relied
on.
but
they
say
there
are
other
factors
in
the
record
that
would
convince
us
that
the
sentence
was
proper.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
you're
not,
you're
not...
we're
not
deciding
that
case
when
we,
if
we
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
can't
dream
one
up
that
the
district
court
didn't
rely
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
particular
question
is
within
the
scope
of
your,
of
the
question
you
raised
on
certiorari
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just,
you
posed
us
the
question
of
whether
the
sentence
must
be
remanded
and
resentenced
if
both
improper
and
proper
factors
are
relied
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
question.
i
don't
know
that
we
have
to
decide
which
one
of
you
are
right
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
improper
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
of
them
were
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
them
were
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
those,
that
those
older
than
15-year-old
convictions
could
be
considered,
and
you
didn't
challenge
that
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
say
it.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it,
that
the
district
court
properly
relied
on
those
old
convictions.
that's
what
they
specifically
held.
you
didn't
challenge
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
right
now.
yes,
indeed.
that's
what
they
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
wonder
if
you
have
challenged,
if
you
have
raised
that
question...
you
didn't
challenge
that
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said,
they
said
we
cannot
say
that
consideration
of
these
two
convictions
as
part
of
an
overall
assessment
of
the
defendant's
criminal
background
was
inappropriate.
