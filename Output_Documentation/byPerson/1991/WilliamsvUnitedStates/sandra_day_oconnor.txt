do
you
think
there
is
any
indication
in
this
record
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
given
a
lower
sentence
if
he
had
not
considered
the
arrest
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
trial
judge--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
trial
judge
also
said
that
the
court,
too,
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
prior
arrest
record
itself
shall
not
be
considered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
when
the
seventh
circuit
reviewed
this
it
determined,
i
guess,
that
it
thought
the
sentence
was
reasonable.
right?
that
the
sentence
given
was
reasonable
even
though
there
was
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
with
regard
to
the
prior
arrest
record.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought,
i
thought
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
remand,
that
it
found
it
was
reasonable--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
didn't
remand.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
so
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
theory
of
that
court
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
the
seventh
circuit
affirm
if
it
were
satisfied
that
the
district
court
would
have
imposed
a
lower
sentence
absent
those
factors,
or
just
if
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
if
it's
satisfied
that
the
district
court
would
have
imposed
the
same
sentence
anyway?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
need
for
remand
if
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
the
same
sentence
would
have
been
imposed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
my
assumption
was
if
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
the
same
sentence
would
have
been
imposed,
what's
the
need
for
a
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
they
talk
about
is
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
page
what,
ms.
wax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's...
isn't
that
harmless
error?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
is
williams
against
the
united
states
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
williams,
was
convicted
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin
for
possession
of
a
firearm
while
a
convicted
felon.
the
applicable
sentencing
range
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
was
18-24
months.
the
district
court
departed
upward
from
this
range
and
sentenced
williams
to
27
months
imprisonment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
williams'
sentence
even
though
it
held
that
one
of
the
two
grounds
that
the
district
court
had
given
to
support
its
upward
departure
was
not
a
valid
factor
for
consideration.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
a
court
of
appeals
may
affirm
a
sentence
in
which
a
district
court's
departure
from
the
guideline
range
is
based
on
both
valid
and
invalid
factors.
appellate
review
of
federal
sentencing
decisions
is
governed
by
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984
as
amended.
in
a
decision
filed
today,
we
hold
that
in
certain
circumstances,
the
act
allows
the
court
of
appeals
to
affirm
a
departure
sentence
based
in
part
of
invalid
factors.
the
reviewing
court
may
affirm
the
sentence
if
it
determines
that
the
district
court
would
have
imposed
the
same
sentence
even
without
relying
on
the
invalid
factors
and
that
the
remaining
valid
factors
are
sufficient
to
justify
the
magnitude
of
the
departure.
because
we
are
unable
to
ascertain
if
this
was
the
analysis
employed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
we
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
for
a
determination
consistent
with
the
opinion.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy.
