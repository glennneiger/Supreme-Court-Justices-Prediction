mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
in
a
sentencing
guideline
case
the
sentencing
of
joseph
n.
williams.
mr.
williams
was
indicated,
tried,
and
convicted
and
sentenced
in
1989
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
wisconsin
for
violating
18
u.s.c.
section
922(g)(1),
possession
of
a
firearm
having
been
previously
convicted
of
a
felony.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
in
a
sentencing
guideline
case
a
sentence
must
be
remanded
for
resentencing
if
both
improper
and
proper
factors
were
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
in
sentencing,
or
whether
such
a
sentence
may
be
upheld
if
there
are
proper
factors
standing
alone
that
would
justify
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
williams
was
sentenced
in
the
district
court
both
on
improper
and
proper
factors,
the
27
months
in
prison
to
be
followed
by
a
3-year
period
of
supervised
released.
the
improper
factor
that
was
considered
by
the
district
court
in
this
sentencing
were
arrests
that
had
not
resulted
in
convictions.
there
was
no
litigation,
there
was
nothing
determining
that
these
factors
were
indicative
of
more
serious
criminal
activity.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
sentence
with
these
improper
factors,
notwithstanding
it
stated
in
its
opinion
a
specific
holding
that
there
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
in
considering
such
sentencing
an
arrest.
notwithstanding
that
they
affirmed
the
sentence.
it
should
be
noted
that
arrest
records
in
and
of
themselves
which
have
not
resulted
in
convictions
are
prohibited
by
section
4a1.3
of
the
guidelines,
sentencing
guidelines.
the
seventh
circuit
stated
in
its
opinion
that
these
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions,
whether
or
not
litigated,
should
not
have
been
considered
in
the
defendant's
criminal
history
points
if
they
were
not
based
upon
accurate
and
reliable
evidence
of
a
more
significant
criminal
history.
the
district
court
in
its
preliminary
calculations,
this
is
the
preliminary,
sir,
calculation
of
the
correct
applicable
sentencing
guideline
considered
the
recommendations
of
the
probation
office
which
placed
the
offense
level
at
9,
criminal
history
points
at
10,
and
a
criminal
history
category
of
roman
numeral
v,
with
a
resulting
sentencing
range
of
18
to
24
months.
the
district,
however,
in
its
final
determination
of
the
applicable
sentencing
guidelines,
that's
his
final
determination,
what
he
actually
considered
it
to
be,
the
correct
applicable
sentencing
guideline,
decided
that
the
criminal
history
category
was
not
adequately
considered
by
the
probation
office
and
he
assessed
3
additional
criminal
history
points,
raising
the
criminal
history
points
to
13
and
the
criminal
history
category
to
6,
with
an
offense
level
of
9
and
a
sentencing
range
of
21
to
27
months,
which
was
greater.
he
had
previously
stated
that
he
was
going
to
assess
the
sentencing
against
this
defendant
based
at
the
highest
level,
so
this
raised
him
up
from
24
to
27
months
by
the
inclusion
of
these
3
additional
points.
but
in
so
doing,
in
determining
the
final
applicable
guideline,
the
district
court
misapplied
the
guidelines
by
improperly
considering,
incorrectly
applied
the
sentencing
guidelines
by
improperly
considering
in
sentencing
the
numerous
arrests
which
had
not
resulted
in
convictions
and
which
defendant
had
never
been
prosecuted.
here's
what
the
district
court
said
when
he
did
this,
this
was
raising
up
his
3
points
from
10
to
13.
the
serious
criminal
conduct
reflected
in
those
arrests,
the
serious
criminal
conduct
reflected
in
those
arrests,
coupled
with
convictions
more
than
15
years
old,
both
of
which
are
barred
by
the
sentencing
guideline,
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
defendant's
criminal
history
was
significantly
more
serious
than
that
of
most
defendants
in
category
v,
and
the
court
added
3
criminal
history
points
to
the
previous
criminal
history
point
calculation
of
10,
resulting
in
13
criminal
history
points,
and
placed
the
defendant
in
category
vi
with
a
sentencing
range
of
24
to
27
months,
and
by
so
doing
he
misapplied
the
guidelines.
4a1.3
does
not
permit
prior
arrest
records
in
and
of
themselves
to
be
considered
in
sentencing,
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
4a1.1
section
a
also
state
that
convictions
over
15
years
old
are
not
to
be
considered
in
sentencing.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
in
his
preliminary
calculation
he
said
i
am
setting
the
criminal
history
points
at
10.
then
he
says
however,
because
of
these
arrests
and
other
criminal
activity
which
were
not
resulting,
they
are
over
15
years
old,
the
other
point
that
he
made
in
doing
this,
the
convictions
were
over
15
years
old,
he
says
because
of
those
they
show
a
more
serious
criminal
history
because--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--pardon
me.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
okay.
but
then
he
goes
and
he
says
the
4a1.3,
i
can
consider
that.
he
steps
over
that
by
saying
there
is
permission
in
certain
areas
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
to
consider
that
type
of
thing.
but
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
permitting
that
specifically
states
this
does
not
apply
to
arrest
records
in
and
of
themselves.
that's
what
he's
relying
on
here
because
there
had
been
no
convictions
on
those
arrests.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
no,
i
don't
think
so.
because
if
there
is
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
the
reasonableness
issue
is
not
a
part
of
it.
all
you
have
to
show
in
a
misapplication
that
there
was
a
misapplication,
then
the
congressional
will
stated
in
that
section
of
the
code,
18
u.s.c.
3742(1),
if
there
is
a
misapplication
you
shall
remand.
clear
and
precise,
shall
remand.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
they
did.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
that's
correct.
they
did.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
the
theory
of
it
is
they
say,
and
i'll
again
answer
that
they
have
a
rule,
the
seventh
circuit
clearly
stated
its
rule
in
this
regard
and
in
its
opinion.
it
stated
it
was
error,
this
is
out
of
their
opinion,
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
consider
the
prior
arrests
of
defendant,
it
was
error
to
do
that,
that
had
not
resulted
in
convictions.
nevertheless
vacation
of
the
sentence
is
not
necessarily
required.
this
is
what
they
say,
this
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
has
adopted
the
rule
that
the
sentence
may
be
upheld
if
there
are
proper
factors
that
standing
alone
would
justify
the
departure.
in
other
words
if
there
are
other
factors
that
they
could
say
in
their
mind
was
sufficient
to
justify
this
sentence
regardless
of
the
improper
factors
being
there,
they
would
affirm
the
sentence.
that's
their
position.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
i
don't
think
they
really
considered
that.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
i
think
what
they're
really
saying,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
your
question,
is
that
they
would
affirm
it
regardless
of
what
the
improper
factor
was
or
whether
it
determined
in
a
higher
sentence
or
a
lower
sentence
if
there
were
proper
factors
in
their
opinion
that
would
justify
this
type
of
sentence.
they
are
disregarding
the
improper
factors,
but
they
cannot
do
that.
if
there
are
improper
factors
considered,
the
other
opinion
which
is
based
in
three
or
four
other
circuits
say
that
there
is
no
way
to
control
as
to
which
amount
the
improper
factors
had
in
the
final
decision.
they
don't
know.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
yes,
there
is
need
for
it.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
because
you
don't
really
know
that.
and
the--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is
that
clear
because
you
are
saying
then
it
is
possible
for
a
reviewing
court
to
determine
accurately,
consistently
right,
what
is
the
correct
sentence
here,
and
they
have
determined
that
below.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--there
is
this
doctrine
of
harmless
error,
but
i
don't
think
in
the
guideline
situation
that
you
can
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
i
would
refer
you
to
a
very
good
case
on
that
point--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--no,
i
do
not,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
i'll
tell
you
why.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
in
united
states
v.
stephenson,
887
f.
2d
57,
at
pages
61
to
62,
it's
a
fifth
circuit
case
1989,
a
guidelines
case,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
found
a
similar
incorrect
application
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
improper
factor
there
was
the
considering
of
convictions
more
than
15
years
old,
not
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions,
but
both
of
these
factors
were
considered
improper
by
the
sentencing
guidelines.
and
they
go
on,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
government
invites
us
to
consider
the
erroneous
weighing
of
the
prior
incarceration
as
harmless
error
as
the
district
court
indicated
he
would
probably
have
imposed
a
sentence
of
151
months
even
if
he
could
have
adjudged
less.
okay,
here
we
go.
we
may
not
do
so,
however,
in
the
light
of
18
u.s.c.
3742
(f)(1)
which
directs,
if
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
the
sentencing,
that
the
sentence
was
imposed
of
a
violation
of
law
or
imposed
as
a
result
of
the
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines,
the
court
shall
remand
for
further
sentencing
proceedings
with
such
instructions
as
the
court
considers
appropriate.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
they've
done
that
in
this
case.
he
raised
up
three
points
because
of
that
consideration
of
the
improper
factors.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
i
think
we
do.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
there
is--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--i'm
going
to
point
out
to
you,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
this
is
why
i
think
we
can
determine
whether
it
was
raised,
whether
criminal
history
points
were
raised
from
10
to
13
because
of
something
that
he
considered
to
be
in
the
case,
the
district
court
stated
in
the
sentencing
opinion,
page
69
of
the
joint
appendix
is
where
you
can
find
it,
that
the
serious
criminal
conduct
in
those
arrests,
that's
the
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions,
that's
what
he's
referring
to,
coupled
with
convictions
more
than
15
years
old,
that's
what
he's
basing
his
upward
departure
on,
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
defendant's
criminal
history
was
significantly
more
serious
than
that
of
most
defendants
in
category
v,
and
the
court
accordingly
added
three
criminal
history
points
to
the
previous
criminal
history
point
calculation
of
10,
resulting
in
13
criminal
history
points.
he
is
raising
it
up
because
of
those
two
facts.
that's
what
he's
saying.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
but
he
does
say
that
that...
he
said
that,
i
don't
deny
that.
but
he
said
also
just
what
i
have
said,
that
he
is
relying
on
those
two
factors
for
the
upward
departure.
there
are
other,
this
man
has
a
criminal
history,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
he
is
making
the
upward
departure.
the
previous
calculation
had
been
at
10.
he
said
i'm
going
to
13,
and
he
tells
you
why
he's
going
to
13,
because
he
is
considering
these
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions
and
because
of
the
other
factor
which
he
has
stated
was
convictions
more
than
15
years
old.
and
he
is
doing
it
for
that
reason.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
assume
that
because
there--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--no,
no,
i
don't.
no,
i
don't.
not
at
all.
no.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
i
don't...
i
thought
you
phrased
it
in
a
hypothetical
that
if
there
were
that
situation,
just
one
improper
factor
and
two
or
three
good
factors,
then
he
would
have
authority
in
his
own
way
of
doing
things
justifying
what
he
did.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think...
here's
what
really
i
think
you've
got
here,
judge.
you've
got
a
defendant
up
there
and
he
is
going
to
be
sentenced.
now,
a
sentencing
hearing
is
not
a
big
thing.
you
can
do
a
sentencing
hearing
in
one
afternoon
in
a
couple
of
hours
if
you
have
to.
why
not
sentence
the
man
on
the
proper
factors
alone?
when
he
walks
out
of
that
courtroom
he
knows
he
has
been
sentenced
on
things
which
he
actually
did,
has
been
proven
against
him.
these
other
things
which
are
not
properly
proven
against
him
are
being
considered
against
him.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
was
an
improper
thing
to
do.
they
admit
that.
why
go
through
all
that?
send
it
back...
the
appellate
court
is
not
to
consider
the
sentencing
anyway.
the
sentencing
is
to
be
done
by
the
district
court.
and
give
the
man
his
sentence.
he
is
going
to
be
sentenced,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
he
is
going
to
be
found
guilty
and
sentenced
for
what
he
did.
do
it
on
the
proper
factors.
when
i
sent
williams
the
copy
of
the
opinion,
the
seventh
circuit,
he
called
me
and
he
said
well,
the
seventh
circuit
said
it
was
in
error
for
me
to
be
considered
on
that
point
for
sentencing.
isn't
that
right?
and
i
said
yes,
that
is
right.
he
said
well,
is
that
fair?
why
not
sentence
the
man
on
the
correct
factors?
it's
easy
to
do.
why
bring
in
this
other
factor
and
you
create
this
terrific
doubt.
there
is,
several
other
circuits
would
say
if
that
improper
factor
is
considered
that's
the
wrong
way
to
go
at
this
thing.
if
it's
not
done
on
the
complete
proper
factors,
send
it
back.
do
it
right.
then
he
knows
where
he's
at.
then
everybody
knows
what
the,
what
the
sentence
is
done
on
the
basis
of
it,
only
on
the
correct
factors.
there
is
no
reason
for
keeping
an
improper
factor
in
the
sentencing.
do
it
on
the
correct
factors.
and
the
objectives
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
which
you're
creating
here
is
that
you
want
honesty
in
sentencing,
you
want
proportionality,
and
you
want
uniformity.
those
are
the
three
factors
that
the
guidelines
are,
were
put
into
effect
for.
convicting
the
man
and
sentencing
him
on
improper
as
well
as
proper
factors
doesn't
improve
that
position
that
the
guidelines
was
requiring
to
be
put
into
effect,
the
honesty
of
the
sentencing.
there
are
several
circuits
which
hold
that
you
have
to
remand
if
you
do
consider
improper
factors.
the
ninth
and
the
tenth
and
the
fifth
circuit
clearly
hold
that
in
such
a
situation
that
should
not
be
considered.
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
few
of
those.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
yes,
they
are.
yeah,
they
are.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
just
this
one,
united
states
v.
hernandez-vasquez,
it's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
884
f.
2d
1314.
the
guidelines
anticipate
that
departure
will
be
rare.
if
the
court
relies,
this
is
the
ninth
circuit,
if
the
court
relies
on
both
proper
and
improper
factors
the
sentence
must
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded.
because
the
district
court
considered
improper
factors
we
must
vacate
the
sentence
and
remand
for
resentencing.
moreover,
this
is
another
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
because
the
court
statement
of
reasons
contained
an
improper
as
well
as
a
proper
basis
for
departure
we
have
no
way
to
determine
whether
any
portion
of
the
sentence
was
based
upon
consideration
of

improper
factors.

court
fails

the
accuracy
of
the
challenged
information
in

presentence

to
state
that
it
is
not
relying

the

circuit
held
in
the
united
states
v.
zamarripa,
905
f.
2d
337,
at
page
342,
it's
a
1989
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
where
one...
here's
where
you
go,
here's
on
the
one
question,
where
one
of
two
or
more
stated
reasons
for
the
departure
is
invalid
the
case
must
be
remanded
for
resentencing
because
the
reviewing
court
cannot
determine
whether
the
same
departure
would
have
resulted
absent
the
improper
factor.
consequently
you
vacate
the
sentence.
those,
plus
stephenson...
now,
there's
one
more
case
i
want
to
give
you
before
i
close
on
this
thing,
and
it's
the
only
case
decided
by
this
court
on
the
sentencing
guideline
outside
of
this
one,
united
states
v.
misstreata,
109
supreme
court
647
at
652,
this
court
stated
the
following.
the
sentence
reform
act
of
1984
makes
the
sentencing
commission
guidelines
binding
on
the
courts
although
it
preserves
for
the
judge
the
discretion
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
applicable
to
a
particular
case
if
the
judge
finds
an
aggravating
or
mitigating
factor
is
present
that
the
commission
did
not
adequately
consider
for
formulating,
when
formulating
the
guidelines.
in
other
words
they
are
saying
that
which
has
been
determined
by
the
guidelines
is
binding
on
this
court,
but
it
is
only
in
an
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstance
in
regard
to
a
factor
that
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
consider
in
creating
the
guidelines
that
permits
this
departure.
in
other
words
the
departure
has
to
be
based
on
something
outside
of
a
factor
that
was
considered
and
determined
in
the
guidelines,
which
has
been
done
here.
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions
have
been
strictly
considered
and
decided
by
the
sentencing
guidelines,
and
convictions
more
than
15
years
old,
the
same
thing.
that's
been
considered
and
is
part
of
the
guidelines.
the
only
way,
according
to
misstreata,
that
you
can
make
that
departure
is
if
those
factors
that
they
are
relying
on
were
not
considered
by
the
guidelines,
and
that's
2,
that's
2,
that's
3742(f)(2).
if
they
have
been
considered
they
can't
make
the
departure
on
that
case.
that's
a
good
opinion,
and
it's
the
opinion
of
this
entire
court,
not
entire,
there
was
one
dissent,
but
it's
a
solid
opinion.
they
have
not
followed
that
in
this
case.
these
factors
were
determined
and
considered
by
the
sentencing
guidelines.
misstreata
is
the
final
word,
i
would
say,
in
this
particular
situation.
i'll
save
any
time
that
i
have
for
reply,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
i
agree.
i'm
going
to
win
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
first
of
all,
you've
got
a
case
on
the
record
right
now,
misstreata,
it's
the
only
case
that
went
before
this
court
on
the
sentencing
guidelines,
and
the
language
in
that
opinion
says
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984
makes
the
sentencing
commission
guidelines
binding
on
the
courts
although
it
preserves
for
the
judge
the
discretion
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
applicable
to
a
particular
case
if
the
judge
finds
an
aggravating
or
mitigating
factor
is
present
that
the
commission
did
not
adequately
consider
when
formulating
the
guidelines.
both
of
these
factors
were
considered
by
the
guidelines.
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions
and
convictions
more
than
15
years
old.
they
have
defined
that
those
things
are
not
ordinarily
usable
and
properly
usable
in
such
a
situation.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
i
am
sure
there
is.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
here
is
what
they
say
in
the
guidelines.
4a1.1(a).
certain
prior
sentences
are
not
counted
or
are
counted
only
under
certain
conditions.
here's
what
they
say.
a
sentence
imposed
more
than
15
years
prior
to
the
defendant's
commencement
of
the
incident
offense
is
not
counting
unless
the
defendant's
incarceration
extended
into
the
15-year
period.
if
the
conviction
was
over
15
years
old
and
the
sentencing
of
that
conviction
did
not
extend
into
the
15-year
period
between
that
offense
and
this
offense
it
is
not
to
be
considered.
that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
no.
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
they're
talking
about
departures,
sure.
that's
how
you're
going
to
get
up
there,
is
by
including
this.
they
say
you're
not
supposed
to
do
that.
both
arrests
over
15...
what
is
stephenson
saying?
he
takes
up
that
point
specifically
in
stephenson.
he
says
he
can't
do
that
because
the
incarceration
in
that
case
was
in
the
15-year
period,
the
convictions
were
past
the
15-year
level.
he
says
he
can't
do
it.
stephenson
is
a
great
case.
read
it.
on
page
64
and
65.
they
go
into
that.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
the
sentence...
the--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--well,
that's
the
basic
overall
thing,
yeah.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
i
think
if
you
read
stephenson,
if
you
read
misstreata,
there
is
no
two
ways
that
you're
going
to
get
this
information
in
properly
to
determine
an
upward
departure.
both
of
these
factors
that
he
relies
on,
that
he
sentenced
this
upward
departure--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--pardon?
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
sure
they're
both--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--well,
not
all,
no.
not
all.
but
the
ones
that
she
is
using
and
that
have
been
used
by
this
court
to
make
this
upward
departure
aren't
proper.
and
another
thing,
3741...
3742(1)
clearly
states
if
it
was
a
result
of
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines.
stephenson
exactly
says
that
this
type
of
thing,
convictions
more
than
15
years
old,
are
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines.
he
says
that
right
in
this
opinion.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
that's
what
he
decided.
now
that's
a
circuit
court
decision
there.
you
get
up
to
misstreata,
which
is
this
court's
decision,
they're
saying
the
only
way
you
can
make
that
departure
is
if
the
guidelines
had
not
considered
these
issues.
they
have
considered
these
issues.
you
have
got
to
go
by
what
the
guideline
says
here,
and
that's
what
they're
getting
at.
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions,
convictions
more
than
15
years
are
not
to
be
considered.
but
now
you're
going
to
say--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--wait
a
minute.
wait
a
minute.
i
don't
follow
you
there.
where
did
i
say,
where
did
i
say
that?
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
you
mean
in
our
case
here,
not
the--
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
--what
did
they
say,
so
i
understand
what
you're
getting
at
here?
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
that's
the
seventh
circuit
you're
talking
about?
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
what
was
the,
what
was
the
conviction?
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
well,
that's...
they
use
those
words,
that's
what
they're
saying.
but
they
can
be
wrong
on
that.
mr.
kenneth
h.
hanson
yes,
sir.
i
so
did,
yes.
that's
my
position
in
the
whole
case.
i
think
the
misstreata
decision
of
this
court
is
completely
dispositive
of
the
issue.
they
have
to
determine
that
these
things
were
not
considered
by
the
guidelines
in
making
this
upward
departure,
and
they
haven't
done
that.
