justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
were
three
factors
that
the
court
mentioned,
but
you
can't
show
that
without
the
one
incorrect
one
it
wouldn't
have
been
the
same
sentence.
you
don't,
we
just
don't
know.
and
if
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
that
the
sentence
was
a
result
of
that,
it,
you
just
haven't
made
out
your
case.
so
you
get
out
of
(f)(1)
and
you're
down
to
(f)(2),
because
you'd
say
it's
outside
the,
without
that
factor
maybe
it's
outside
the
applicable
guideline
range
and
is
unreasonable.
and
i
gather
that's
what
the
court
did
here,
so
it
just
decided
whether
it
was
unreasonable
or
not.
but
how
do
you
know
it
was
a
result
of
the
improper
factor?
do
we
know
that
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
it
mentioned
that
factor
and
a
number
of
others.
it
might
have
been
the
same
without
that
factor,
and
if
the
burden
is
on
you
to
show
it
was
as
a
result
of
an
incorrect
application
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
he
had
mentioned
one
erroneous
factor
along
with
two
valid
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
still
the
same
case?
i
mean,
that's
not
your
case.
let's
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wax,
what
if
the
sentencing
judge
says
the
reason
i
am
departing
from
the
guidelines
to
a
higher
level
is
a,
b,
and
c,
and
both
a,
b,
and
c,
or
all
three
of
them
are
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
satisfy
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
other
side
says
that
that's
what
occurred
here.
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
there's
a
difference
between
it
occurred
as
a
result
of
or
not.
i
mean,
i
can
say
it
occurred
as
a
result
of
this
mistake,
but
the
court
would
have
done
the
same
thing
even
without
the
mistake.
aren't
they
two
separate
questions?
i
don't
want
to,
you
know...
it
can
be
a
result
of
it
even
though
you
would
have
reached
the
same
result
by
some
other
means,
but
in
fact
it
was
a
result
of
this
mistake.
and
that's
what
the
statute
says.
if
it
was
a
result
of
it.
now
maybe
he
would
have
gotten
the
same
place
anyway,
but
if
so
he'll
do
it
on
remand.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
statute
says,
if
it
was
a
result,
even
if
it's
conceivable
that
for
some
other
reason
he
might
get
there
anyway--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
why
i
asked
you
my
first
question,
ms.
wax,
and
what
you're
saying
now
is
inconsistent
with
your
answer
to
that.
if
you
believe
what
you're
now
saying,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
say
even
though
the
judge
says
i
am
giving
you
the
additional
three
points
because
of
a,
b,
and
c,
and
even
though
a,
b,
and
c
are
all
bad,
you
would
still
have
to
further
inquire
whether
there
wasn't
some
other
material
down
there
which
would
have
led
him
to
the
same
conclusion
anyway.
but
your
answer
was
categorical.
if
he
gives
all
wrong
reasons
you
say
it
goes
back
automatically.
now,
which,
which
is
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
ms.
wax.
i
mean,
that's
what
you
want
it
to
say,
that
the
decision
wouldn't
have
been
different.
the
statute
says
that
the
decision
must
not
have
been
a
result.
now,
if
the
decision
could
be
a
result
of
the
improper
factors,
even
though
were
the
same
judge
to
decide
it
over
again
he
might
decide
the
same
way,
it
would
still
have
been
a
result
of
the
improper
factors
if
they
were
the
only
things
he
considered.
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why,
where
in
this
record
there
is
any
indication
that
all
of
the
factors
that
he
used
for
the
three
point
departure
were
not,
were
not
improper
factors?
what
other
factors
did
he
use
for
the
three-point
departure
that
were
not
improper
factors?
the
only
things
i
see
here
are
five
felonies,
two
of
which
were
beyond
the
15-year
period,
and
that's
improper,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
two
of
the
five.
that's
what
it
says
in
the
record.
that's
what
he
says
in
the
record
anyway.
he
says
the
record
is
replete
with
convictions--
--where
are
you,
where
are
you
reading?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
at
53,
chief
justice.
the
record
is
replete
with
convictions,
and
even
if
we
count
to
but
five
felony
convictions
the
court
has
the
belief
that
the
10
points
assessed
is
insufficient
for
the
five
felonies,
two
of
which
are
outside
the
15-year
parameters.
now,
so
he's
using
five
felonies,
which
is
an
improper
factor
because
there
were
really
only
three
within,
you
know,
that
he
should
have
been
considering.
and
the
other
thing
he
is
using
are
the
arrests,
which
he
shouldn't
have
been
considering.
so
all
the
factors
he
said
he
is
relying
on
are
bad
factors.
but
you
want
us
to
say
well,
that's
right,
it
was
cause...
it
was
a
result
of
an
improper,
of
an
incorrect
application
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
but
we're
going
to
ask
ourselves
would
that
judge,
even
though
it
was
a
result,
if
he
had
to
make
the
same
thing
over
again
would
he
have
come
out
the
same
way.
i
don't
think
that's
a
proper
reading
of
the
statute.
once
you
find
it's
a
result,
it's
a
result,
period.
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
proper
factor.
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
colleague
was
saying
that
it
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
just
trying
to
save
time,
chief
justice.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
it
then
that
you...
there
is
complete
disagreement
on
what
the
law
says
between
you
and
ms.
wax?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
convictions
more
than
15
years
old
cannot
be
the
basis
of
a
departure?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
to
be
considered
for
the
regular,
for
the
regular
level.
but
can
it
be
the
basis
of
a
departure
from
the
regular
level?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
talking
about
departures?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did,
you
did
say,
to
be
fair,
in
your
question
presented,
when
the
sentencing
commission
has
determined
that
arrests
not
resulting
in
convictions
and
convictions
more
than
15
years
old
should
not
be
considered
in
determining
the
defendant's
criminal
history
category.
should
this
court
permit
a
district
judge
to
use
such
information
in
departing
upward
to
a
harsher
sentence?
and
you
rephrase
that
in
your
brief.
you
rephrase
that
question
in
your
brief.
