well,
we
always
do
that
with
harmless
error
analysis,
don't
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
appellate
courts
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
wax,
is
(f)(1)
sufficient
in
this
case?
could
you
take
me
through
the
statute?
because
you
cite
(f)(2)
in
your
brief,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
(f)(1)
would
be
sufficient
for
the
result
that
you
want,
but
maybe
i'm
incorrect
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
does
(2)
help
you
when
it's
not...
i
take
it
you
don't
think
this
is
unreasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
how
is
(2)
applicable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
do
you
get
out
of
(2)?
once
you
find
it's
unreasonable
it's
just
not
relevant...
pardon
me,
once
you
find
it's
reasonable
it's
just
not
relevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
study
it.
it
still
seems
to
me
that
section
(1)
would
be
adequate,
that
section...
and
you
have,
you
have
to
go
beyond,
somewhat
beyond
the
statutory
language
anyway
in
order
to
reach
your
result
of
harmless
error.
so
i
don't
see
how
(2)
helps.
may
i
get,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
ms.
wax?
i
understand
your
argument,
but
are
you
sure
it
fits
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
in
this
case,
because
this
case
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
make
any
determination
under
(1).
your
opponent
says
they
did,
but
even
i
don't
think
you
would
argue
that
they
did
determine
it
was
not
imposed
as
a
result.
what
they
did
is
go
right
to
the
reasonableness
inquiry
and
decide
that
they
thought
it
was
reasonable.
they
did
not
make
the
decision
that
they
thought
the
district
court
would
have
imposed
the
same
sentence.
do
you
think
their
analysis
was
adequate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
figures
on
how
many
of
those
are
appealed?
