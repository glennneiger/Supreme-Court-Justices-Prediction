ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
perhaps
it's
best
to
begin
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
in
subsection
(e)
of
section
3742
of
title
18
we
are
told
that
in
reviewing
a
sentence
including,
in
this
specific
case,
a
sentence
that
departs
from
the
guideline,
an
appellate
court
must
determine
whether
that
sentence
was
imposed
as
a
result
of
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines
or,
in
the
case
of
departures,
whether
the
sentence
is
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
the
court
must
ask
a
number
of
questions.
was
there
a
departure
from
the
guidelines?
did
the
district
court
make
an
error
in
applying
the
guidelines
in
the
course
of
its
departure
decision?
can
it
be
determined
that
the
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
was
responsible
for
the
departure,
that
is
was
an
impermissible
consideration
the
but
for
cause
of
the
sentencing
decision?
and
finally,
was
the
resulting
sentence
unreasonable?
under
subsection
(f)
if
the
court
determines
that
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
is
a
result
of
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
it
must
remand
the
sentence.
if
the
court
cannot
make
that
affirmative
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
record
then
it
has
to
go
on
to
consider
whether
the
sentence,
the
departure,
the
decision
to
depart,
and
the
degree
of
departure
is
reasonable,
having
regard
for
the
remaining
valid
reasons
given
by
the
court,
but
also
the
record
as
a
whole.
now,
in
the
case
of
departures
from
the
guidelines,
this
system
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
a
court
is
authorized
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
when
there
are
circumstancing,
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime
that
indicate
that
the
severity
of
the
criminal
conduct
is
not
reflected
in
the
guidelines.
under
the
statute
sentencing
courts
are
required
to
give
reasons
for
departing
from
the
guidelines,
and
very
often
district
judges
cite
more
than
one
reason
for
departing
from
the
guidelines.
also
on
many
occasions
it
is
not
uncommon
for
judges
to
make
mistakes
in
explaining
their
reasons
for
a
departure.
some
of
the
factors
they
cite
may
be
valid
grounds
for
departure
and
others
may
not
be
valid.
it
is
also
not
uncommon,
however,
for
departure
decisions
to
be
what
we
might
call
overdetermined
decisions.
that
is
very
often
a
judge
has
more
than
enough
reason
to
decide
to
depart
from
the
guidelines,
so
that
not
all
of
the
reasons
that
are
mentioned
are
actually
essential
to
the
decision
to
depart.
now,
given
this
situation
it
means
in
practice
that
not
every
mistake
that
a
judge
or
a
court
makes
in
deciding
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
will
actually
issue
in
a
sentence
that
needs
to
be
corrected.
if
congress
had
a
rule,
in
effect
an
automatic
reversal
rule
whereby
every
error
that
a
judge
makes
in
the
course
of
applying
the
guidelines
and
making
a
decision
to
depart
requires
an
automatic
remand,
in
practice
that
would
result
in
a
lot
of
useless
remands.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
if
all
three
of
them
are
bad
that
means
that
satisfies
(e)(2).
then
the
judge
did
make
a
decision
to
depart
as
a
result
of
a--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
so
we
wouldn't
go
on
to
evaluate
reasonableness
in
that
case.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that
the
record
bears
us
out.
we
cite
several
passages
which
certainly
would
support
a
court's
determining
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
court
would
have
given
the
same
sentence,
and
that's
all
that
the
court
is
really
required
to
determine
to
go
on
to
the
reasonableness
evaluation.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we
read
as
a
result
of
language
to
mean
in
effect
a
but
for
cause
in
the
sense
that
the
judge
would
not
have
given
the
same
decision,
would
not
have
given
the
same
sentence
if
it
had
not,
if
the
judge
had
not
considered
that
factor.
there
is
a
way
of
seeing...
a
judge
can
consider
a
reason.
if
you
asked
the
judge
when
he
made
the
decision
what
are
you
considering,
he
might
give
all
three
reasons.
but
that
doesn't
mean,
as
this
court
said
in
price
waterhouse,
they
said
exactly
this.
if
you
ask
the
decision
maker,
he
would
give
all
the
reasons,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
one
reason
you
isolate
is
a
but
for
cause
of
the...
it's
a
result
of
that
reason.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
because
the
result
of
inquiry
actually
looks
at
what
the
decision
maker
who
makes
the
decision
would
have
done,
not
what
some
other
decision
maker
over
here
could
have
done
with
the
same
record.
reasonableness
looks
at
other
factors
that
another
decision
maker
might
have
been
able
to
look
at,
but
we
can't
get
to
that
point
until
we
make
a
determination
about
this
judge
and
this
court
based
on
what
they
say,
what
they
would
have
done.
it's
a
hypothetical
exercise.
it's
a
thought
experiment.
we
understand
that
the
analysis
requires
us
to
hypothesize
about
what
this
judge
would
have
done
if
he
had
not
had
regard
for
the
improper
reasons,
but
that's
the
sort
of
thought
experiment
this
court
engages
in
all
the
time.
it
does
it
under
title
vii,
it
does
it
in
other
cases
where
there
are
over
determined
decisions
where
many
different
reasons
are
given
and
we
have
to
decide
if
the
illegitimate
reason,
the
invalid
reason,
is
really
the
one
that
is
responsible
for
the
decision,
and
that
the
decision
would
be
different
without
it.
that's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
value
that's
at
stake
here,
and
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
that
value
was
much
more
important
before
the
sentencing
reform
act
than
it
is
now,
because
now
it's
possible
for
appellate
courts
to
in
effect
substantively
review
sentences.
for
the
appellate
courts
to
evaluate
the
objective
legitimacy
of
sentences
really
apart
from
what--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
district
court
did--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
that's
true.
and
the
first
part
of
the
test
looks
to
what
the
sentencing
court
actually
did,
at
least
in
the
sense
that
if
there
is
a
positive
determination
that
the
sentencing
court
would
have
done
it
differently
we
send
it
back.
now,
if
you
can't
make
that
positive
determination...
in
effect
what
congress
did
here
is
they
said
well,
if
we
can't
make
that
positive
determination
we
don't
really
care
what
was
going
through
the
mind
of
the
district
court.
it
may
be
possible
that
the
district
court
would
have
done
it
differently
if
we
sent
it
back,
but
possible
isn't
good
enough.
now
the
appellate
court
is
going
to
step
in
and
it
is
going
to,
in
this
limited
circumstance
in
effect
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
sentencing
court
and
make
its
own
decision
about
whether
the
departure
is
reasonable,
conceding
that
because
it
has
already
passed
the
results
test
there
must
be
valid
grounds
and
sufficient
grounds
out
there
that
the
sentencing
court
gave.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it
wouldn't,
because
all
(f)(1)
tells
you
is,
it
tells
you
what
happens
if
the
court
actually
determines
that
the
sentence
was
a
result
of
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
and
implicitly
here
the
court
didn't
make
that
determination,
or
else
it
would
have
remanded.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
you
must
go
to
(2).
and
that
shows
why
it's
reasonable
to
have
this,
this
harmful
error
standard,
if
that's
what
you
want
to
call
it,
because
that's
not
the
end
of
the
matter.
when
the
court
fails
to
make
the
determination
that
the
lower
court
would
have
done
it
differently,
it's
not
as
if
the
uncertainty
is
resolved
against
the
defendant
and
we
rest
with
that.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
correct.
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
the...
(1)
and
(2)
tell
us
what,
how,
what
it
is
that
the
appellate
court
must
do
and
the
determinations
that
the
appellate
court
must
make,
the
actions
that
the
appellate
court
must
take
when
it
finds
certain
things.
(f)(1)
tells
us--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
if
the
court
finds
that
it's
unreasonable,
even
though
it
has
passed
the
test
of
(1),
the
sentence
must
go
back.
so
there
is
a
second
chance
for
a
remand,
so
to
speak.
the
court
must
remand
if
it
finds
that
the
departure
is
nevertheless
unreasonable
even
though
the
court
would
have
given
it
anyway.
so,
for
example,
suppose
that
the
court
decides
that
the
factor,
the
invalid
factor,
here
an
arrest
record
that
a
district
court
relied
on,
didn't
really
affect
the
sentence,
the
court
would
have
given
the
same,
would
have
made
the
decision
to
depart
anyway.
and
suppose
that
the
court
decides
to
depart
by,
oh,
let's
say
10
years
instead
of
3,
instead
of
3
months
as
it
did
here.
then
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
a
10-year
departure
is
reasonable.
now,
on
this
record
a
10-year
departure
probably
wouldn't
be
reasonable,
and
in
that
case
the
sentence
should
go
back.
so
the
reasonableness
inquiry
is
mainly
focused
on
the
degree
of
departure.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
they
do
not
in
so
many
words
make
a
but
for
type
of
a
determination.
i
mean,
that's
true.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think
their
language
can
fairly
be
read
to
involve
a
determination
that
the
court
wouldn't
have
done
things
differently,
and
the
language
i
am
referring
to
is
on
page
82
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
says--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--82
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
court--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
certainly
the
case
that
they
cite,
united
states
v.
franklin,
the
previous
seventh
circuit
case,
had
taken
a
purely
objective
sort
of
appellate
reweighing
view
of--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--this
matter.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
in
that
sense
they
were
just
parroting
what
franklin
says.
we're
not
recommending
that
standard
here,
that
in
fact
the
court
can
disregard
all
the
errors
and
whether
the
errors
caused
the
sentence,
and
they
can
just
go
ahead
and
decide
whether
it
would,
there
was
a
correct
result
or
not.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--there
is
language
that
i
think
can
fairly
be
construed
to
have
made
the
proper
determination,
and
they
say,
the
middle
paragraph
of
82,
we
conclude
that
despite
the
error
noted
the
court
correctly
determined
that
mr.
williams'
criminality
was
not
reflected
properly
in
the
criminal
history
category,
which
goes
to
the
decision
to
depart
or
not.
so
we
read
that
as
in
effect
saying
setting
aside
the
error
noted
the
court
made
a
correct
determination
to
depart,
or
that's
one
possible
way
of
reading
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
that...
examining
the
other
factors
is
both
part
of
deciding
whether
the
misapplication
actually
affected
the
decision
and
part
of
the
reasonableness
inquiry.
it's
part
of
the
first
inquiry--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--true.
we're
not
exactly
recommending
a
harmless
error
standard,
but
we
just
chalk
that
up
to
a
careless
vocation.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
precisely.
the
same
decision.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
one
has
to
be
careful
here.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
statute
says
that
there
needs
to
be
an
affirmative
determination
that
the
decision
would
not
have
been
different.
that's
different
from
harmless
error.
a
harmless
error
determination
would
be
something
like
the
court
must
decide
that,
that
the
court
would,
would
have
made...
would
not
have
made
a
different
decision.
it's
a
difference
in
how
the
uncertainty
is
resolved.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
no,
he...
there
were
five
felonies
and
then
there
were
two
beyond
the
15-year
period.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
where
are
you
reading?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
let's
just
get
one
thing
straight.
in
deciding
to
depart
he
is
allowed
to
use
the
two
convictions
outside
the
15-year
range.
that
is
a
proper
ground
for
a
decision
to
depart.
so
that
is
a
proper
ground--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
it
is.
yes.
so--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--he
is
wrong.
under
the
guidelines,
4a1.3,
it
specifically
says
that
a
judge
may
use
convictions
that
are
not
counted
in
the
actual
criminal
history
score
in
deciding
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
if
those
factors
demonstrate
to
the
judge
that
the
criminal
history
score
doesn't
properly
take
into
account
the
severity
of
the
record.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly.
and
that's,
that's
the
valid
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
was--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
and
in
fact
the
passage
you're
reading
from
on
page
53
of
the
joint
appendix
if
anything
helps
us.
because
in
effect
there
the
court
is
saying
that
looking
at
these
five
felonies
including
the
valid
ground
for
departure
alone
we
conclude
that
10
points
isn't
enough.
and
then
in
the
very
next
paragraph
he
mentions
the
prior
arrest
record
and
then,
without
missing
a
beat,
says
and
we
know
that
we
can't
rely
on
a
prior
arrest
record
under
the
guidelines.
under
4a1.3
it
says,
it
spells
out
that
this
is
not
a
valid
ground
for
departure,
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
record
on
which
we
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
court
would
have
done
the
same
thing
if
it
had
never
taken
note
of
the
arrest
record.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
quite
reasonably
concluded
that
it
wouldn't
take
much--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
from
an
upper
sentence
of
24,
or
a
ceiling
sentence
of
24
to
a
ceiling
of
27,
and
the
court
decided
to
sentence
at
the
top
of
the
guidelines
range.
now,
as
we
said,
this
is
a
very
sensible
system
of
appellate
review.
it's
a
pragmatic
system
because
there
are
44,000
sentences
a
year
that
are
doled
out
under
the
sentencing
reform
act,
and
congress
could
logically
have
an
interest
in
not
remanding
a
lot
of
sentences
that
in
fact
were
legitimate
and
valid
and
had
a
perfectly
good
justification
under
the
guidelines
and
in
the
record.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i'm
sorry,
we
don't.
we
do
know
that
there
are
almost
three
times
as
many
downward
departures
as
there
are
upward
departures.
and
so
the
rules
that
were,
the
reading
of
3742
that
we're
recommending,
it's
quite
evenhanded
between
downward
and
upward
departures
in
that
it
tends
to
minimize
the
number
of
mandatory
remands.
and
of
course
when
the
government
is
appealing
downward
departures
we
have
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
number
of
mandatory
remands.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
yes
and
no.
congress
could
have
designed
a
system
like
that,
but
it
didn't.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
designed
a
sort
of
hybrid
system.
the
first
question
is
did
the
sentence
result
from
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines,
can
we
determine
that
it
did?
once
we
answer
no
to
that,
then
the
court
has
to
evaluate
the
reasonableness
of
the
departure
that
was
actually
given,
and
when
it
does
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prevents
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
juncture
from
looking
at
the
record
as
a
whole,
and
maybe
perhaps
looking
at
some
other
things--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
on
our
reading
of
3742
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
do
that.
it
may
well
be
tempting
for
them
to
do
that.
there
have
been
some
court
of
appeals
that
have
done
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
if
the
sentence
is
wholly
the
product
of
invalid
factors,
even
if
there
were
18
other
valid
factors
the
court
could
have
relied
on,
it
has
to
go
back.
that's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--not
for
the
decision
to
depart.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we...
we--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no.
if
they--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--they
have
to
talk
about
reasonableness.
okay.
once
they
decide
that
it
is
not
definitely
the
case
that
the
district
court
would
have
done
something
different--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--okay,
then
we're
into
the
realm
of
well,
they
might
have
done
something
different,
we're
not
really
sure,
and
we're
not
sure
the
degree
of
departure
was
proper.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
there
are
two
groups
of
cases
that
can
remand
it
at
two
separate
stages
of
the
inquiry.
the
ones
where
it's
a
result
of
the
misapplication,
and
then
the
ones
that
are
unreasonable.
and
all
the
other
ones
can
be
affirmed.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
