justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
you
had
a
situation
in
which
the
court
said
i
am
considering
all
of
these
arrests
but
in
fact
my
sentence
would
be
exactly
the
same
even
if
i
didn't
consider
the
arrests?
in
other
words
i
am
kind
of
throwing
in,
that's
just
what
i'm
doing,
but
i'm...
that
is
not
dispositive
and
in
fact
i
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
without
it.
you
would
have
a
perfect
harmless
error
situation
there,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
before
you
refer
me
to
the
case,
though,
do
you
think
that
harmless
error
analysis
would
be
appropriate
in
that
instance?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
you
go
ahead.
i
was
just
going
to
say
why
didn't
you
just
cite
us
to
the
statute
instead
of
to
the
opinion?
i
mean,
it
is
what
the
statute
says,
that
if
it
was
imposed
in
violation
of
law
or
imposed
as
a
result
of
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines,
it
must
remand
for
further
sentencing.
suppose...
well,
that
is
what
it
says.
but
it
also
says
it
has
to
have
been
imposed
as
a
result.
now
whose,
whose
burden
is
it
to
show
that
the
sentence
was
imposed
as
a
result
of
an
incorrect
application?
it's
yours
on
appeals,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
we
accept
your
argument
there.
isn't
it
fair
to
say
here
that
one
of
the
values
that
we
want
to
preserve
is
the
value
of
kind
of
an
active
informed
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judges?
and
if
that's
what
we
want
to
do,
if
we
want
an
assurance
that
the
resulting
sentence
really
is
the
result
of
a
judge's
expert
and
informed
discretion,
then
why
don't
we,
as
it
were,
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
defendant
in
each
case
and
on
the
hypothesis
that
you
give
send
it
back
simply
to
preserve
that
value?
justice
david
h.
souter
--they've
got
a
much
narrower
range
to
do
it,
but
discretion
hasn't
been
eliminated
entirely
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
then
you
must
go
to
(2)?
