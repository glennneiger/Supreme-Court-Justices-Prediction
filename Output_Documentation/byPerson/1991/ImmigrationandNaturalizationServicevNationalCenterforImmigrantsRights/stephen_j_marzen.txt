mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
statutory
authority
to
require
an
arrested
alien,
as
a
condition
of
his
release
on
bond,
to
refrain
from
unauthorized
employment
pending
a
final
determination
of
his
deportability.
in
1983
the
attorney
general
promulgated
the
regulation
challenged
in
this
case.
the
operative
two
sentences
read
as
follows;
condition
against
unauthorized
employment,
a
condition
barring
employment
shall
be
included
in
an
appearance
and
delivery
bond
in
connection
with
the
deportation
proceeding
or
bond
posted
for
the
release
of
an
alien
in
exclusion
proceedings
unless
the
district
director
determines
that
employment
is
appropriate.
the
ninth
circuit
below
held
that
the
regulation
exceeds
the
attorney
general's
statutory
authority
under
section
1252(a)
of
8
usc.
that
section
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may
impose
such,
quote,
such
conditions
as
the
attorney
general
may
prescribe,
close
quote,
on
release
bonds.
the
court
of
appeals
principally
reasoned
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
detain
an
alien
for
engaging
in
unauthorized
employment
and
that
a
bond
condition
must
therefore
relate
to
insuring
appearance
for
hearings.
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
attorney
general's
regulation
is
within
his
statutory
authority
for
three
reasons.
first,
bond
conditions
may
be
used
to
further
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws.
second,
protecting
american
workers
from
displacement
by
alien
workers
is
a
core
purpose
of
those
immigration
laws.
and
third,
a
bond
condition
against
unauthorized
employment
helps
protect
american
workers
from
displacement
by
aliens.
the
text
of
section
1252(a)
authorizes
release
of
an
alien
on
bond
containing,
quote,
such
conditions
as
the
attorney
general
may
prescribe.
those
conditions
are
not
limited
by
the
text
of
that
section
to
any
particular
subset
of
the
concerns
of
the
immigration
laws.
as
the
attorney
general
explained
almost
20
years
ago
in
his
decision
in
toscano
rivis,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
construe
the
quoted
language
to
mean
that
the
attorney
general
may
impose
bond
conditions
which
are
totally
unrelated
to
the
various
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws.
but
the
reports
clearly
demonstrate
a
congressional
intent
to
grant
wide
discretion
otherwise.
in
particular,
section
1252(a)--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--it
would
be
perfectly
consistent
to
apply
it
even
for
authorized
work
as
to
aliens
who
are
authorized
to
work
only
by
regulation.
in
other
words,
the
attorney
general
could
decide
that
aliens
in
deportation
proceeding
who
only
are
authorized
by
his
regulation
to
work
may
lose
that
authorization
if
they
are
in
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes.
he
could
apply
the
regulation--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--against
them
to
forbid
their
work.
now
i
would
note,
though,
in
that
context
that
he
has
not
applied
the
regulation
in
that
fashion.
and
in
fact,
part
208
of
8
cfr
specifically
provides
that
any
alien
who
files
a
nonfrivolous
asylum
petition
shall
be
given
work
authorization
pending
the
determination
of
that
asylum
application.
the
same
thing
applies
to
aliens--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--before
the
bond
is
stamped
no
work
authorized,
there
is
a
determination
by
the
district
director
or
his
designate
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
alien
has
an
important
part
to
play
because
he
has
to,
he
will
be
asked
to
furnish
evidence
of
his
work
authorization.
the
determination
whether
an
alien
is
authorized
to
work
comes
down
to,
is
based
on
two
facts.
first,
whether
the
person
arrested
by
the
ins
is,
in
fact,
an
alien.
and
we
will
usually
know
that
from
statements
given
to
the
arresting
officer
or
travel
documents
found
on
the
alien.
they
will
say
his
country
of
birth
and
it
won't
be
the
united
states.
the
second
fact
you
need
is
whether
that
immigration,
whether
the
immigration
status
held
by
the
alien,
if
any,
authorizes
him
to
work.
that
determination
is
made
with,
by
reference
to
8
cfr
274(a)(12).
it
lists
the
27
or
26
statuses
that
authorize
an
alien
to
work.
so
the
alien
will
even,
either
show
his
green
card,
will
show
some
other
document
issued
by
the
ins
which
the
ins
requires
the
alien
to
hold
on
his
person,
or
will
give
the
ins
his
a
or
application
number,
which
again
is
cross-referenced
to
his
immigration
status.
and
you
can
just
read
from
the
regulation
whether
that
status
entitles
the
alien
to
work.
so
it
is
an
informal
hearing.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
he,
he
can
still
say
what
his
a
number
is.
and
that
will
list
whether
he
is,
for
example,
a
lawful,
permanent
resident
and
is,
therefore,
entitled
to
work
by
virtue
of
status.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no.
the
condition...
once
the
officer...
the
officer
makes
the
determination
whether
the
alien
is
authorized
to
work.
but
once
the
officer
decides
that
the
alien
is
not
authorized
to
work,
the
condition
must
be
imposed.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
there's
no
specific...
the
initial
determination
by
the
district
director
or
his
designate
is
informal.
it's
not,
there
are
no
specific
procedures
provided
by
the
regulation.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
we
take
the
position,
and
it
hasn't
been
applied
yet,
but
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
alien.
in
implementation
of
the
employee/employer
sanctions
in
irca,
the
alien
is
required
to
show
the
employer,
actually
anyone
is
required
to
show
the
employer,
documents
evidencing
a
right
to
work,
either
a
green
card
or
some
combination
of
a
couple
of
other
forms
of
documentation,
like
a
social
security
card
and
a
driver's
license.
the
district
director
is
essentially
asking
the
alien
to
furnish
the
same
sort
of
documentation.
and
given
that
the
alien
is
the
one
who
would
have
that
documentation
or
who
would
know
his
a
number,
it's
reasonable
to
require
him
to
provide
that
information.
i
would
note,
though,
that
immediately
after
the
arresting
officer
or
the
district
director
or
his
designate
makes
the
determination,
there
is
prompt
administrative
and
judicial
review
as
we
outlined.
the
form
that
the
alien,
that
contains
the
bond,
has
a
check-mark
box
so,
which
the
alien,
and
the
alien
is
required
to
sign
the
form.
and
he
has
to
check
a
box
saying
whether
he
wants
a
bond
redetermination
proceeding
by
an
immigration
judge.
those
bond
redetermination
proceedings
are
held
very
promptly
in
large
cities
with
large
alien
populations.
in
california
and
in
texas,
they're
held
every
weekday.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
that's
correct.
and
there's
a
further
level
of
review
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
and
the
statute
also
authorizes,
gives
the
alien
the
right
to
file
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
is,
and
it's
not
the
case
that
the
alien
will
even
have
to
wait
in
custody
while
the
writ,
while
the
litigation
is
going
on.
he
can
post
the
bond
with
the
condition
that
he
not
work.
and
as
long
as
he
asks
for
a
bond
redetermination
within
7
days
after
posting
bond,
he
can
challenge
the
imposition
of
that
condition
while
he
is
free
on
bail
and
through
all
the
avenues
of
administration
and
judicial
relief.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
it
depends
on
the
alien's
status.
frankly,
96
percent
of
aliens
who
are
arrested
and
charged
with
deportability,
according
to
ins
statistics
as
of
fiscal
year
1989,
entered
without
inspection.
if
that
status
determination
is
right,
they're
not,
they're
clearly
not
supposed
to
be
here
for
any
reason,
let
alone
to
work.
it's
not
a
further
ground
for
their
deportation
that
they,
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--for
the
vast
majority
of
aliens
in
deportation
proceedings.
for
some
people
who,
for
example,
a
tourist
who
has
overstayed
his
or
her
visa,
for
example,
they
would
be
deportable
for
overstaying
the
visa
and
if
they
engaged
in
work,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
that
status
even
if
it
were
still
in
effect.
so
it
depends
on
the
status
the
alien
has.
but
the
general
answer
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
it's
not
an
additional
ground.
i
do
note,
though,
that
the
statute,
once
we
do
have
a
ground
for
arresting
an
alien,
the
attorney,
the
statute,
1252(a),
gives
the
attorney
general
the
authority
in
his
discretion
to
retake
an
alien
back
into
custody
so
that
if,
for
example,
an
alien
entering
without
inspection
were
found
to
have
been
engaged
in
unauthorized
employment,
the
attorney
general
would
be
entitled
in
that
case,
even
without
the
regulation,
to
take
the
alien
back.
what
the
regulation
and
the
bond
condition
give
us
the
authority
to
do
is
to
hold
the
risk
of
forfeiture
over
the
alien
to
encourage
voluntary
compliance
with
essentially
a
preexisting
duty
not
to
engage
in
work.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
we
want
to
enforce
this
regulation.
and
regrettably,
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
would
prevent
this
or
any
revised...
the
presidential
effect,
would
throw
a
cloud
over
any
revised
regulation,
because
the
ninth
circuit
where
about
40
percent
of
our
immigration
work
takes
place,
has
held
that
we,
that
it
simply
is
not
a
basis
for
either
detaining
or
using
detention
as
a
lever
against
unauthorized
employment.
and
that
we
have
to
hold
individualized
hearings,
so
individualized
that
we
have
to
treat
each
of
these
cases
as
a
matter
of
first
impression,
if
you
will.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
have
kept
on
the
books,
it's
still
codified
at
8
cfr
103.6,
this
particular
regulation
and
seek
to
enforce
it
to
make
sure,
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
the
attorney
general
does
have
the
statutory
authority.
section
1252--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i
was...
and
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
thought
i
was
answering
the
question
of
whether
engaging
in
unauthorized
employment
was
a
separate
ground
for
deportability.
and
for
some
aliens,
it
is.
but
a
mere
violation
of
the
condition
itself,
you're
exactly
right,
would
not
be
a
ground
for
deportability.
section
1252(a)
simply
cannot
be
read
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
the
first
2
times
around
and
as
the
respondents
read
it
now.
to
be
concerned
solely
with
appearance,
this
court
in
carlson
v.
landon
rejected
the
contention
that
the
predecessor
to
section
1252(a)
was
concerned
only
with
appearance.
the
sixth
circuit,
which
wrote
one
of
the
opinions
under
review
in
that
case,
held
that
the
alien
communist
there
had
to
be
released
because
the
attorney
general's
authority
was
limited
to
insuring
appearance
for
deportation
proceedings.
this
court
rejected
that
limiting
construction.
it
held
that,
and
dismissed
as
of
not
great
significance
the
factor
of
probable
availability
for
trial.
once
you
are
beyond
the
appearance
limitation
and,
as
this
court
has
held,
can
detain
people
for,
who
are
security
risks
or
can
exercise
the
authority
under
1252(a)
to
further
the
public
interest,
prevention
of
unauthorized
employment
and
protection
of
the
american
labor
force
against
displacement
by
aliens
is
clearly
one
of
those
purposes.
if
respondent's
contention
were
correct,
it
would
mean
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
revoke
bail
or
impose
a
condition
on
an
alien
who
repeatedly
engages
in
unauthorized
employment.
in
fact,
we
could
not
even
impose
the
standard
mandatory
condition
that
is
imposed
on
pretrial,
on
people
who
are
arrested
for
crimes
and
are
released
pending
trial
that
they
not
violate
a
federal,
state,
or
local
law.
if
the
authority
in
subsection
(a)
is
construed
narrowly,
the
attorney
general
would
have
even
less
authority
over
arrested
aliens
who
are
charged
with
deportability
than
we,
than
the
attorney
general
has
over
people
arrested
for
violations
of
federal
crimes,
criminal
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no.
in
fact,
it's--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--yes,
without
question.
that
is
an...
it
is
important,
though,
that
to
note
that
although
the
attorney
general
has
had
the
authority
given
by
section
1252(a)
for
40
years
and
has
gone
on
record
as
saying
he
has
the
authority
for
more
than
20,
he
has
exercised
it
in
a
very
conservative
and
measured
fashion.
and
has,
in
fact,
the
only
condition
that
i
am
aware
of
that
he
has
imposed
beyond
ensuring
appearance
is
to
prevent
unauthorized
employment,
although
he
could
certainly
impose
this
standard
condition,
the
standard
mandatory
condition
that
i
just
referenced
with
relation
to
people
released
before
trial.
the
history
of
successive
legislation
is
yet
another
reason
why,
that
makes
clear
that
congress
authorized
bond
conditions
beyond
those
related
to
appearance.
the
immigration
act
of
1917
permitted
release
on
bond,
quote,
conditioned
that
such
alien
shall
be
produced
when
required
for
a
hearing
or
hearings
in
regard
to
the
charge
upon
which
he
has
been
taken
into
custody,
close
quote.
congress
expanded
the
permissible
bond
conditions
in
the
legislative
history,
they
said
they
wanted
to
change
that
law
in
1950
in
the
internal
security
act.
the
revised
act,
after
repealing
the
1917
law,
specified
that
the
appearance
condition
shall
only
be
among
the
conditions.
and
the
legislative
history
which
referenced
h.r.
10
specified
that
the
attorney
general
shall
have
full
discretion
and
untrammeled
authority
to
impose
conditions
for
bond.
section
1252(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
is
the
attorney
general's
current
authority,
followed
the
procedure
established
by
the
1950
internal
security
act.
once
it
is
agreed
that
bond
conditions
and
the
attorney
general's
authority
in
section
1252(a)
can
extend
to
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws,
it
must
extend
to
protecting
american
workers
from
displacement
by
aliens.
congress
clearly
intended
to
protect
american
workers
from
displacement
by
aliens
not
intended
to
work.
they
did
so
in
two
ways.
the
first
way
was
described
this
court
in
sure-tan
as
the
principle
of
selectivity.
nonimmigrants
can
lawfully
enter
the
united
states
only
in,
generally
speaking,
only
in
a
status
that
does
not
authorize
them
to
work.
and
immigrants
and
the
remainder
of
nonimmigrants
can
enter
the
united
states
in
a
status
that
authorizes
them
to
work
only
if
the
secretary
of
labor
has
first
certified
that
they
will
not
take
away
jobs
from
american
workers
who
are
willing
and
able
to
work.
if
there
was
any
doubt
on
congress'
purpose
in
this
regard
it
was
resolved
by
the
employers'
sanctions
enacted
by
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1976.
it
prevents
employers,
the
other
half
of
this
employment
contract,
from
hiring
the
alien.
indeed,
8
usc
1324
defines
unauthorized
alien
to
mean
an
alien
not
a
permanent,
lawful
resident
or,
quote,
authorized
to
be
so
employed
by
this
chapter
or
by
the
attorney
general.
thus,
congress
has
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
unauthorized
by
work,
unauthorized
work
by
aliens
is
an
evil
that
it
wanted
to
prevent.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
giving
up
much,
because
the
immigration
laws
vest
vast,
vast
discretion
to
the
attorney
general.
with
respect
to
your
particular
question,
it
is
in
fact
a
ground
of
deportability,
not
only
violating
a
federal
law,
but
violating
a
state
or
local
one
as
well.
so
that
is
within
the
various
purposes
of
immigration
laws.
i'm
simply
actually
defending,
as
i
quoted
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
that
it
must
relate
to
the
various
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws.
that
doesn't
give
up
an
awful
lot,
although,
again,
with
respect
to
how
that
authority
has
been
used,
it
bears
mention
that
for
the
two
decades
that
the
attorney
general
has
been
on
record,
he
has
only
used
that
authority
to
prevent
unauthorized
employment.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
the
carlson
majority
said
it,
said
it
had
to
relate
to
the
legislative
scheme.
again,
the
legislative...
now
that
section
23
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
has
been
codified
and
adopted
for
purposes
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
the
purposes
are
very,
very--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
true.
it's
just
i'm...
for
purposes
of
justice
scalia's
question--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--that's
exactly
right.
it,
there
are
not
many
public
interests
that
are
not
part
of
the,
a
purpose
of
the
immigration
law,
although,
again,
this
case
does
not
require
the
court
to
plumb
the
depths
of
exactly
how
far
that
authority
goes.
we're
dealing
here
with
authority
that
is
at
the
very
absolute
core
of
the
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws
and
was,
before
the
immigration
nationality
act
and
the
contract
labor
legislation
was,
in
the
1952
act,
and
was
reaffirmed
by
congress
in
the
1986
immigration
reform
and
control
act.
a
bond
condition
against
unauthorized
employment...
actually,
before
i
get
to
that,
i
should
perhaps
address
the
ninth
circuit's
rationale
in
particular.
they
concluded
that
the
attorney
general's
authority
did
not
extend
to
detaining
aliens
for
unauthorized
employment,
and
by
analogy
that
the
bond
condition
could
not
be
used
for
prevention
of
unauthorized
employment
almost
entirely
on
the
basis
of
irca's
rejection
of
employee
sanctions.
they
had
two
basic
rationales;
that
carlson
did
not
deal
with
unauthorized
employment,
which
is
true,
but
it
still
dealt
with
a
nonappearance
related
restriction;
and
that
irca
rejected
employee
sanctions.
in
that
regard
there
are
a
number
of
points
should
be
made.
in
irca,
congress
can
be
said
to
reject
at
most
a
criminal
sentence
for
unauthorized
employment.
it
did
not
reject
prehearing
detention.
in
addition,
there
was,
in
fact,
no
legislative
rejection
of
employee
sanctions.
the
reference
that
respondents
make
occurs
in
hearings
on
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act.
and
it
was
simply
a
senator
in
colloquy
with
a
testifying
witness
dismissing
a
witness'
suggestion
that
that
would
be
a
good
legislative
proposal.
there
is
no
congressional
act
as
a
body
rejecting
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
proposed
irca
legislation
or
amending
irca
to
take
out
an
employee
sanction,
nothing
that
would
indicate
that
congress
felt
it
actually
would
be
bad
to
use
bond
conditions
or
detention
in
the
way
the
attorney
general
might.
in
addition,
a
surprising
concession
in
the
brief
by
respondents
is
that
the
ninth...
whatever
authority
irca
provides
or
doesn't
provide
cannot
affect
the
attorney
general's
preexisting
authority
in
prior
legislation.
that
takes
out
the
guts
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
because
whatever
congress
did
in
1986,
it
clearly
did
not
impliedly
repeal
the
attorney
general's
authority
under
section
1252(a)
to
impose
bond
conditions
to
further
the
various
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws.
with
that,
it's
knowing
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
further
these
immigration
law
purposes
and
that
unauthorized
employment,
prevention
of
it,
is
at
the
core
of
those
purposes.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
bond
condition
helps
protect
american
workers
from
displacement
by
aliens.
what
it
does,
in
fact,
is
provide
an
additional
lever
over
aliens
to
encourage
voluntary
compliance.
aliens
and
their
families
often
put
up
the
money
to
post
bond.
the
risk
of
forfeiture
is
a
very,
very
effective
way
of
getting
the
aliens
to
comply
with
the
bond
condition
and
prevent
the
evil
congress
identified
of
them
working.
this
additional
enforcement
measure
is
important,
especially
as
the
legislative
history
we
cite
in
our
brief,
to
those
american
workers
with
few
job
skills
who
live
on
the
margin
of
our
society.
5
years
after
passage
of
irca,
the
ins
is
still
arresting
and
charging
with
deportability
almost
1
million
aliens
a
year.
although
most
of
those
aliens
take
a
voluntary
departure,
more
than
100,000
of
them
contested
deportation
hearings.
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
the
authority
that
he
seeks
to
exercise
in
this
case,
he
would
not
be
able
to
tell
those
100,000
aliens
that
they
cannot
engage
in
unauthorized
employment.
and
in
that
case
the
aliens
would
hold
jobs
that
american
workers
should
have
instead.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
three
points.
first,
mr.
schey
asserts
that
there
are
thousands
of
cases
in
which
there
are
derivative
citizenship
claims.
with
the
addition
of
the
new
case
that
he
has
litigated
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
know
now
of
a
total
of
two
such
cases,
one
cited
in
our
brief
in
1961
and
the
one
he
just
mentioned.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
the
second
part
of
my
point
is
at
page
25
of
our
opening
brief,
footnote
16.
there
is
an
ins
operating
instruction
which
provides
as
follows;
quote,
individuals
maintaining
a
colorable
claim
to
u.s.
citizenship
will
not
normally
be
subject
to
the
condition.
there
is
an
out
for
us
if
we
think
it's
abusive
or
frivolous.
but
if
you
have
a
colorable
claim,
the
regulation
will
not
be
applied
to
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
we
do
make
an
exception
in
the
operating
instruction
for
just
this
sort
of
case.
secondly,
the
1990
immigration
act
which
mr.
schey
brings
up
as
congress
legislating
new
authority
to
detain
aliens
which
it
didn't
otherwise
have
is
not
quite
what
the
1990
act
says.
the
1990
act
restricts
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
release
people.
congress
was
dissatisfied
with
the
attorney
general
releasing
aggravated
felons
pending
a
final
determination
of
their
deportability.
so
congress
reduced
the
attorney
general's
preexisting
authority
to
let
these
people
out
on
bail.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
i'm
referring
to
the
most
recent
amendment.
and
the
reason
it
was
needed
is
that
congress
did
not
want
to
allow
the
release
of
aggravated
felons.
he
took
away
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
release
them
either
on
their
own
recognizance
or
on
bond.
the
attorney
general,
under
this
law,
cannot
release
aggravated
felons
under
any
bond
condition
unless
he
determines
that
they
pose
no
risk
of
flight
and
no
danger
to
the
community.
my
final
point
is
with
respect
to
the
legislation--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--um--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--i'm
not
sure.
the
date,
the
only
date
that
it's
attached
to
was
an
addendum
on
september
7,
1984.
so
it's
several
years
ago,
but
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
announced
contemporaneously
with
the
regulation.
the
legislative
history
of
h.r.
10...
i
just
will
direct
the
court,
if
i
might,
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
our
reply
brief
which
points
out
that
subsection
(c)
which
contains
the
legislative
history
to
which
he
refers
does
limit
detention.
but
that,
that
provision
had
lifetime
detention
for
those
four
classes
of
aliens
after
a
finding
of
deportability.
that
same
legislation,
and
that's
on
page
6a,
the
same
act,
h.r.
10
on
pages
3a
and
4a
contains
almost
in
haec
verba
the
authority
that
the
attorney
general
has
in
current
section
1252(a),
pending
a
final
determination
of
deportability,
the
alien,
the
attorney
general
may
in
his
discretion
continue
the
alien
custody
or
release
him
on
conditions.
the
legislative
history
to
which
he
cites
refers
to
a
very
controversial
provision
which
wasn't
adopted.
there
was
no
controversy
in
any
of
the
committee
reports
or
any
of
the
floor
debate
over
the
attorney
general's
authority
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
carlson
affirms
that
you
can
impose
conditions
that
are
unrelated
to
release.
and
we
cite
that
as
the
strongest
authority
in
our
favor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
