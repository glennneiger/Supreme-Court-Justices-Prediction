mr.
marzen,
is
an
alien
who
is
found
to
be
doing
work
which
is
not
authorized
subject
to
deportation
on
that
ground?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
working
without
authorization
is
not
an
additional
ground
for
deportation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
curious
about
something.
you
take
the
position
that
the
ins
regulation,
we,
should
be
interpreted
as
not
requiring
a
bond
in
circumstances
in
which
there
is
an
authorized
work
permit
for
the
alien.
why
has
the
ins
not
amended
the
regulation
to
make
that
clear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
schey,
is...
did
this
come
up
as
a
sort
of
facial
challenge
to
the
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
did,
that
it
came
up
before
it
was
ever
even
implemented.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
take
that
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
i
would
assume
that
in
an
individual
case,
the
points
you
raise
could
surely
be
litigated,
whether
due
process
or
something
else
requires
some
kind
of
hearing
or
special
procedure.
but
if
this
is
just
a,
some
kind
of
facial
challenge,
i
wonder
if
we
get
to
those
questions
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
most
recent
amendment,
does...
if
the
statute
means
what
you
say
it
means,
why
was
that
needed,
do
you
suppose?
