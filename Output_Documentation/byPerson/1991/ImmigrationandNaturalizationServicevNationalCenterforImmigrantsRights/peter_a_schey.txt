mr.
peter
a.
schey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
chief
justice
stated
in
u.s.
v.
salerno,
in
our
society
liberty
is
the
norm
and
detention
without
trial
is
the
carefully
limited
exception.
the
challenged
regulation
in
this
case
results
in
two
things.
first,
it
tells
persons
arrested
by
the
ins
and
simply
charged
with
being
deportable...
not
yet
found
deportable,
they've
not
yet
had
a
hearing
before
the
corps
of
immigration
judges
that
the
attorney
general
hires
precisely
to
determine
whether
they
are
deportable
or
not,
it
tells
them
that
in
order
to
exercise
their
right
to
a
deportation
hearing,
they
must
go
cold,
hungry,
and
homeless.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
justice
scalia,
what
the
law
says
is
that
when
you
are
arrested,
you
are
arrested
upon
probable
cause,
just
as
in
a
criminal
case,
you
would
be
arrested
upon
probable
cause.
under
our
immigration
laws,
whether
you
have
a
right
to
work
or
not
depends
on
your
status.
the
attorney
general
has
hired
81
immigration
judges
and
sent
them
throughout
the
country
to
hold
hearings
to
determine
your
status,
to
determine
your
deportability.
until
that
determination
has
been
made,
it
seems
highly
unfair
to
make
the
presumption
that
everyone
arrested
is
definitely
a
deportable
alien
and
unauthorized
to
work.
that's
the
very
point
of
that
hearing.
the
attorney
general
slips
back
and
forth
between
two
descriptions
of
the
class
members
in
this
case.
he
frequently
in
his
brief,
when
he's
trying
to
drive
home
a
point,
refers
to
them
as
illegal
aliens,
much
in
the
same
thrust
of
your
question.
they're
just
illegal
aliens,
they're
not
authorized
to
work
anyway.
but
once
in
a
while
if
you
look
at
the
attorney
general's
brief
he
describes
them
for
what
they
really
are;
they're
simply
people
charged
in
deportation
hearings.
this
court
recognized
in
lopez-mendoza
that
the
majority
of
ins
enforcement
activity
takes
place
in
what
are
called
area
control
operations.
these
are
mass
operations.
this
court
described
those
operations
as
chaotic
in
nature.
it
is
simply
not
fair
to
assume
that
ins
is
right
100
percent
of
the
time.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
absolutely
not.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
absolutely
not.
congress,
justice
scalia,
spent
10
years
debating
legislation
introduced
by
congressman
hobbs,
who
also
introduced
all
the
anti-communist
legislation
that
was
on
the
books
in
the
late
1940's
and
1950's.
congressman
hobbs
introduced
his
first
h.r.
10
in
1939
and
every
year
for
the
next
10
years
he
introduced
legislation
not
just
to
detain
every
alien
as
you're
suggesting,
but
just
to
limit
the
detention
of
four
categories
of
aliens
pending
their
deportation;
criminals,
subversives,
dope
peddlers,
and
slave
traders.
just...
that's
all
that
congressman
hobbs
wanted.
and
anyone
who
reads
the
congressional
debates,
it
will
become
absolutely
plain
that
despite
year
after
year
of
effort
just
to
convince
congress
to
give
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
detain
those
four
groups
of
aliens,
just
those
four
groups,
that's
what
he
was
concerned
about,
every
single
congress
rejected
his
bill
until
finally
in
1950
he
backed
down.
and
he
said,
okay,
congress,
h.r.
10
as
introduced
in
1950
for
the
first
time
said,
i
want
the
attorney
general
to
have
the
power
to
detain
just
those
four
groups
of
aliens,
but
now
i'm
willing
to
say
he
should
detain
them
once
they've
been
found
deportable,
not
pending
the
hearing,
just
once
they've
been
found
deportable.
and
congress
rejected
that
proposal.
in
fact,
one
of
the,
one
of
the
chief
supporters
of
the
hobbs
bill,
h.r.
10,
stated
at
the
end
of
that
process
that
the
senate
wouldn't
even
dignify
the
bill
with
a
vote.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
as
this
court
stated
in
carlson
v.
landon,
it
said
that
the
attorney
general
is
left
without
standards
to
determine
when
to
admit
to
bail
and
when
to
detain.
it
is
familiar
law
that
in
such
an
examination
the
entire
act
is
to
be
looked
at
and
the
meaning
of
the
words
determined
by
their
surrounding
connections.
that
is
precisely
the
holding.
in
carlson,
this
court--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--well,
carlson
was
dealing
with
the
same
language
that
we're
dealing
with
today.
and
in
carlson
and
then
in
witkovich--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--it
held
that
the
aliens
could
be
detained
based
on
two
things.
firstly,
the
court
said
the
attorney
general
is
not
left
with
untrammeled
authority
as
to
bail.
the
attorney
general
must
justify
his
refusal
of
bail
by
reference
to
the
legislative
scheme
to
eradicate
the
evils
of
communist
activities.
this
is
a
permissible
delegation
of
legislative
power
because
the
executive
judgment
is
limited
by
adequate
standards.
when
dealing
with
the
alien
communists,
as
in
these
cases,
the
legislative
standard
for
deportation
is
definite.
and
in
fact,
the
detention
language
that
we
are
discussing
here
today
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
national
security
act
of
1950
which
specifically
not
only
defined
communist
activity,
it
held
that
that
activity
specifically
subjected
the
person
to
deportation
from
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
is
correct.
there
are
several
things.
and
if
the
attorney
general
were
correct,
and
he
doesn't
even
state
it
in
this
limited
fashion,
the
attorney
general
states,
gee,
we
can
detain
as
long
as
it
relates
to
any
of
the
broad
purposes
of
the
immigration
act.
well,
firstly,
having
read
the
legislative
history
extremely
carefully,
i
can
tell
you
without
any
doubt
congress
today
would
still
be
debating
the
1952
act--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--well,
congress
enacted
this
particular
provision
within
the
framework
of
discussions
and
debate
and
conference
reports
that
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend...
the
only
detention,
in
fact,
ultimately
in
1952
when
this
law
was
enacted,
if
you
go
to
part
(b)
or
(c)
of
the
statute,
for
people
who
have
been
found
deportable,
there
congress
specifically
said
that
the
person
could
be
released
on
detention
on
bond
in
amount
and
specifying
such
conditions
for...
excuse
me,
let
me
just
read
you
the
exact
language.
congress
said
in
part
(b)
that,
and
part
(c),
that
the
person
could
be,
and
then
it
repeats
the
language
from
part
(a).
part
(a)
is
for
persons
who
are
awaiting
deportation.
under
part
(c),
which
deals
with
people
already
found
deportable,
congress
repeats
the
language
from
part
(a)
that
the
attorney
general
can
release
on
bond
in
an
amount
and
containing
such
conditions
as
the
attorney
general
may
prescribe,
and
then
adds
the
following
sentence,
or
on
such
other
conditions
as
the
attorney
general
may
prescribe.
what
does
that
language
mean?
right
away,
congress,
once
it
was
dealing
with
people
who
had
been
found
deportable,
congress
added
the
language
that
their
release
could
be
restricted
to
other
conditions.
if
you
look
at
the
part
(a)
that
you're
referring
to,
it
talks
about
conditions
in
the
security.
it's
discussing
conditions
in
the
security.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
right.
your
honor,
all
that
i
can
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
ever
since
the
first,
ever
since
the
first
laws
were
enacted,
no.
when
you
read
the
legislative
history,
it
is
impossible
that
congress
intended
that
section
to
mean
that
the
attorney
general
could
detain
any
person
without
releasing
them
on
bond,
as
long
as
it
related
to
the
broad
purposes
of
the
immigration
act.
under
that
reading--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--any
alien.
under
that
reading,
the
attorney
general
could
detain
anyone
who's
illiterate
because
the
laws
call
for
deportation
of
illiterates.
the
attorney
general
could
detain
any
alien--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--any
alien
who
received
public
assistance
within
5
years
after
entry
into
the
united
states,
any
alien...
there
are
approximately
100
separate
grounds
of
deportation.
and
under
this
broad
reading
of
the
statute,
any
one
of
those
persons...
and
it
is
simply
clear.
in
fact,
in
1952
when
the
debates
came
to
a
head
in
congress
and
they
were
ultimately
rejecting
congressman
hobbs'
effort
to
allow...
all
congressman
hobbs
wanted
was
to
detain
criminals,
dope
peddlers,
slave
traders,
and
subversives.
when
they
ultimately
rejected
that,
in
subsection
(c)
they
specifically
put
in
you
have
to
have
a
criminal
conviction.
under
subpart
(d)
they
specifically
say
once
an
alien
has
been
ordered
deported,
the
attorney
general
can
place
restrictions
on
his
activities
upon
release.
no
such
language
appears
in
(a),
the
attorney
general
can
place
restrictions
on
his
release.
in
order
to
revoke,
if
an
alien
who
is
released
subsequent
to
being
ordered
deported,
if
an
alien
is
released
and
the
attorney
general
says,
don't
work,
and
that
alien
works,
you
look
at
the
final
part
(d)
of
the
statute,
the
only
way
that
bond
can
be
revoked
is
upon
a
criminal
conviction.
why
would
congress
have
given
less
rights
to
someone
awaiting
deportation?
these
people
are
just
awaiting
deportation.
they've
simply
been
arrested.
and
as
to
a
person
who's
been
found
deportable,
congress
says
the
attorney
general
can
place
restrictions
on
that
person,
including
their
activities.
and
it
uses
very
particular
language
and
says
if
the
person
violates
that
condition,
upon
conviction
he
or
she
shall
be
further
detained.
it
would
simply
make
no
sense
for
congress
to
grant
minimal
rights
to
someone
who's
just
charged
with
being
deportable
and
then
grant
all
these
extraordinary
protections
to
somebody
who
has
been
found
deportable.
if
i
can
add
one
other
thing
to,
one
other
aspect
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that
is
that
one
has
to
look
at
the
whole
law.
i
don't
think
one
can
just
look
at
one
phrase.
this
is
a
comprehensive
statute.
in
this
statute,
as
this
court
held,
has
held
twice
now,
in
de
canas
v.
bica,
and...
this
court
has
made
clear
that
in
1952
the
employment
of
aliens
was
at
best
a
peripheral
concern
of
congress.
congress
itself
stated
that.
congress
itself
did
not
make
the
employment
of
undocumented
workers
illegal
until
1986.
and
then
this
wasn't
just
some
congressman,
any
congressman,
who
rejected
the
notion
of
detaining
aliens
for
working
improperly,
this
was
senator
simpson.
senator
simpson
is
the
author
of
the
1986
law.
and
when
a
witness
testified
in
front
of
senator
simpson
and
said,
well,
instead
of
penalizing
employers
we
can
far
better
serve
the
country
by
detaining
aliens
who
work
without
authorization,
senator
simpson
squared
that
approach
and
said
this
is
a
harsh,
he
called
it
harsh,
he
called
it
unrealistic,
and
he
called
it
a
proposal
made
out
of
a
sense
of
frustration.
the
1952
law,
this
court
has
made
very
clear
in
the
sure-tan
case
and
in
de
canas,
these
are
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
this
court
has
made
clear
congress...
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
this
and
this
court
probably
doesn't
agree
with
it,
but
in
1952
congress
at
best
had
a
peripheral
concern
with
the
employment
of
aliens.
and
in
fact,
as
a
predicate
to
the
1952
act
congress
ordered
up
a
study.
congress
conducted
a
study.
the
senate
conducted
a
study
pursuant
to
senate
resolution
137.
nothing
in
that
detailed
study
suggests
a
concern
with
unauthorized
employment.
that
report
states,
it's
senate
report
1515,
80th
congress,
that
reports
states
that
foreign
labor
does
not
present
a
serious
immigration
problem
today.
adequate
safeguards
are
included...
and
they
mean
in
the
1952
proposed
law...
adequate
safeguards
are
included
to
insure
that
such
aliens
will
not
be
admitted
if
unemployed
persons
in
the
u.s.
are
capable
of
performing
such
services.
and
the
adequate
safeguard
that
congress
came
up
with
was
section
212(a)(14)
of
the
act
which
says
you're
excludable
from
the
united
states
if
you
come
to
the
united
states
intending
to
work
and
you
do
not
have
a
work
permit.
i
would
like
to
read
you
the
one
sentence,
the
key
sentence
from
the
conference
report
about
section
1182(a)(14).
it
says
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
committee,
and
this
is
the
conference
committee,
that
this
provision
will
adequately
provide
for
the
protection
of
american
labor
against
an
influx
of
aliens.
now
again,
if
the
attorney
general...
i
can
only
tell
you
that
when
you
read
the
legislative
history
leading
up
to
the
1952
act
and
there
is
poor
old
congressman
hobbs
struggling
to
convince
congress
just
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
detain
four
groups
of
aliens
and
then
backing
off
and
saying,
okay,
i'll
go
along
with
it
if
you,
how
about
we
just
detain
them
once
they're
found
deportable.
and
congress
says
to
that,
no
way.
the
only
way
that
we
will
authorize--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--well,
they
wrote
the
statute.
and
again,
it's
not
my
place
to
say
that
they
read
the
statute
wrong.
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
pungalin
nun,
this
court
said
that
in
this
vital
area
of
public
interest,
no
matter
how
the
chips
may
fall,
it's
this
court's
responsibility
to
rigidly
enforce
the
congressional
intent.
that's
what
this
court
said.
and
in
pungalin
nun
the
chips
fell
down
heavily
against
the
aliens,
very
heavily.
nevertheless,
this
court
said
it
is
our
task
to
rigidly,
rigidly
enforce
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
if
the
congress--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--well,
your
honor,
firstly,
i
think
that
that's...
i
just,
i
really
hear
that
argument
by
the
attorney
general
with,
with
great
pain.
the
notion
that
a
person
can
easily
establish
what
their
status
is
is
simply
absurd.
if
that
were
true
we
wouldn't
need
this
entire
corps,
the
immigration
judges,
this
entire
executive
office
of
immigration
review.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
simple
cases.
as
this
court
noted
in
lopez-mendoza,
97
percent
of
the
people
arrested
by
the
ins
signed
voluntary
departures.
and
they're
out
of
the
country
within
24
hours.
this
regulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
them.
this
regulation
has
to
do
with
the
folk
who
are
contesting
their
deportation.
they
are
saying,
i
am
a
derivative
citizen.
i
just
finished
a
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
mondocka
v.
ins.
ins
said
for
5
years
mr.
mondocka,
you
are
a
deportable
alien.
you
don't
have
any
rights
in
this
country.
i
got
involved
in
the
ninth
circuit
after
they
had
already
issued
a
mandate
and
told
the
guy
to
leave
the
country.
and
at
that
point
i
determined
he
was
a
derivative
citizen.
the
case
went...
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court.
i
did
one
deposition.
and
at
the
end
of
the
deposition
the
attorney
general's
representative,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
said
you
are
right,
this
person
is
a
derivative
citizen.
it
is
in
the
contested
cases
that
the
person
will
erroneously
be
denied
their
right
to
work
pending
the
outcome
of
their
deportation
hearing.
it
is
in
the
difficult
cases.
these
are
not
easy
cases.
some
of
them
are
easy.
my
colleague
from
the
department
of
justice
mentioned
the
student
who
says,
yes,
i'm
a
student.
well,
once
he
says
i
am
a
student,
everybody
agrees
he
has
no
right
to
work.
i
have
no
real
problems
with
that
case.
i
have
the
problem
with
the
thousands
of
contested
cases
where
the
person
is
saying,
i'm
a
citizen,
and
the
ins
is
saying,
you're
not
a
citizen.
or
the
person
is
saying,
i'm
a
derivative
citizen.
there
are
about
seven
classes
of
derivative
citizens.
they're
extremely
complex.
you
have
the...
you're
born
outside
the
united
states,
your
mother
was
a
u.s.
citizen,
she
lived
in
the
united
states
for
7
years
after
the
age
of
14.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
let
me
expand
upon
that
because
i
think
justice
scalia
also
raises,
or
raised
a
good
point.
there
are
some
cases
in
which
the
plaintiffs
would
have
no
argument
with
the
government,
that
a
person
walks
up
and
says,
i'm
illegal,
give
me
political
asylum.
does
that
person
have
any
inherent
right
to
work?
probably
not.
but
there
are
a
multitude
of
cases
in
which
the
person
is
saying,
i
am
a
lawful
resident
alien,
and
the
ins
is
saying,
no,
you're
not
a
lawful
resident
alien,
we
think
you're
a
deportable
alien.
or
the
person
is
saying,
i
am
a...
ins
is
saying...
the
person
is
saying,
i'm
a
national.
a
national
is
people
born
in
guam,
the
virgin
islands.
there's
a
whole
set
of
complicated
laws
about
who
is
a
national
and
who
is
not
a
national.
the
person
saying,
i
was
really
born
in
guam
in
1945
and
ins
is
saying,
well,
that's
ridiculous,
we
think
you
were
born
in
tijuana
in
1956.
it's
those
contested
cases.
this
regulation
makes
no
exception.
this
regulation
presumes
what
ins
has
the
burden
of
proving
at
the
deportation
hearing.
in
1952
congress
did
not
say
when
we
arrest
you,
you
come
forward
and
you
prove
to
us
that
you
are
legally
in
the
country.
in
the
same
section
that
we're
discussing
today,
in
section
242
of
the
immigration
act,
congress
stated
the
immigration
service
has
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
it
certainly
says
that.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
and
there
are
hundreds,
there
are
hundreds--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--oh--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--absolutely--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--exactly.
and
that's
my
point.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
you
just
made
my
point
for
me.
the
supreme
court
said
in
carlson...
and
i
might
add
that
it
reiterated
that
position
just
a
few
years
later
in
witkovich.
and
i
might
also
add
that
this
is
not
an
area
where
there
are
only
one
or
two
court
decisions
out
there.
this
is
an
area
where
there
are
hundreds
of
district
court,
board
of
immigration
appeals,
district
court,
court
of
appeals,
and
at
least
two
supreme
court
decisions.
so
if
this
court
today
votes
with
the
government--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--witkovich.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that
involved
the
same
statute.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
242(d).
mr.
peter
a.
schey
in
witkovich,
the
person
was
arrested
for
communist
activities.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
and,
and
the
ins
said
a
condition
of
release
is
that
you
cannot
work
at
a
communist
newspaper.
and
this
court
struck
it
down.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
he
was,
he
was
arrested
on
a
completely
separate
charge--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that's
right.
well,
it's
not
a
statute.
it's
the
same
statute.
i
mean,
these
communists
were
not
held
under
a
different
statute.
these
communists
were
held
under
the
same
statute
we're
discussing
here
today,
and
precisely
the
language
that
you
read
out
of
carlson
indicated
you
could
not
have
a
blanket
rule.
you
could
not
have
a
blanket
rule.
you
would
have
to
show
that
that
individual
person
presents
a
threat
to
society
before
you
could
condition
his
release
from
detention
on
(a),
(b),
(c),
or
(d).
let
me
raise
one--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--could
not
detain
him
just
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
communist.
you
would
have
to
show
that
that
individual's
activities
would
present
a
threat
to
the
united
states.
there's
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
raise.
congress
obviously
does
not
think
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
power
that
the
attorney
general
thinks
he
has.
and
that
becomes
very
plain
in
the
following.
in
1988
and
again
in
1990,
just
a
few
months
ago,
just
about
10
months
ago,
congress
enacted
the
very
section
we're
discussing
here.
and
how
did
it
amend
the
section?
it
amended
the
section
to
make
clear
that
the
attorney
general
could
detain
without
bond
persons
who
are
convicted
of
felonies.
now,
if
under
part
(a)...
and
congress
took
a
lot
of
time
to
debate
that
because
there
were
a
lot
of
people
in
congress
saying,
well,
a
person
served
his
time
on
the
felony,
we
cannot
just
continue
to
detain
him
without
bond.
if,
if
congress
intended
to
give
the
power
to
the
attorney
general--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--well,
again,
i
don't
think
it's
my
place
to
say
whether
they
misunderstand
it.
all
i
can
say
is
if
congress
felt
that
the
attorney
general
already
had
the
power
that
you
suggest,
it
would
not
have
wasted
its
time
in
1988
and
1990
to
put
in
subparts
to
this
statute
to
make
clear
that
there
are
very
limited
circumstances
under
which
the
attorney
general
can
detain
without
bond.
this
is
a
case
about
detaining
without
bond.
this
is
a
case
about
detaining
people
without
a
hearing
with...
the
attorney
general
says,
oh,
you
get
quick
review.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
you
get
quick
review.
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
is
it
takes
about
4
months
to
get
review.
the
attorney
general
fails
to--
mr.
peter
a.
schey
--no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
that's
not
true.
i
know
that
the
attorney
general
says
that.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i
know
that
they
do.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is,
but
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
indicate,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
regulations.
in
fact,
if
one
looks
at
the
regulations
once,
firstly,
they're
automatic.
the
attorney
general
suggests
that
prior
to...
that
the
attorney
general
will
consider
whether
to
impose
that.
that's
not
what
they
say.
they
say,
in,
at
48
federal
register
8820,
the
rule
would
allow
automatic
imposition
of
this
condition.
it's
an
automatic
imposition.
secondly,
once
it's
imposed,
the
person
against
whom
it
is
imposed
has
to
show
a
compelling
reason,
not
just
a
reasonable
basis.
i
can
come
forward
and
convince
the
district
director
that
i'm
a
u.s.
citizen
and
i
still
have
to
show
a
compelling
reason
to
work
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the,
this
restriction.
if
i
am
found
deportable
by
the
agency,
its
current
regulations...
just
4
weeks
ago,
the
agency
came
out
with
a
whole
new
set
of
employment
authorization
regulations.
if
i
am
found
deportable
by
the
agency
under
these
regulations
that
were
promulgated
in
august...
and
i
don't
understand
how
the
attorney
general
thinks
he's
going
to
apply
both
sets
of
regulations
together...
once
i'm
found
deportable
and
i'm
appealing
my
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
fifth
circuit,
i
cannot
get
work
authorization.
mr.
peter
a.
schey
well,
if
i
actually,
and
i
think
you're
correct,
if
i
actually
persuaded
him
that
i
was
a
citizen,
i
hopefully
wouldn't
be
there
in
a
deportation
hearing
in
the
first
place.
but
my
point
was
if
i
came
forward
and
i
was
able
to
convince
the
local
officials
that
i
have
to
convince
that
i
might
win
my
deportation
hearing
it
would
not
matter
because
under
the
regulation
the
condition
will
only
be
rescinded
if
i
can
show
a
compelling
reason,
and
even
then
it
is
purely
within
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
under
the
regulations
whether
they
will
or
will
not
rescind
the
no
work
right.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
