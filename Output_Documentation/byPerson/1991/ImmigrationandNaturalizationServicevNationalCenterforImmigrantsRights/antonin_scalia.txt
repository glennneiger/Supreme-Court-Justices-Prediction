mr.
marzen,
i
just,
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question
by
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
the
condition
is...
violation
of
the
condition
is
never
a
separate
basis,
an
independent
basis
for
deportability,
is
it?
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
he
will
always
have
committed
a
violation
by
accepting
unauthorized
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
it
a
double
violation,
is
all
that
happens.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
curious
why,
i
mean,
i
understand
you
don't
want
to
bite
off
any
more
than
you
have
to,
but
why
does
the
condition
have
to
relate
to
a
purpose
of
the
immigration
laws?
for
example,
the
condition
you
mentioned
earlier
that
the
person
released
not
violate
any
state
or
federal
law,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
particular
purpose
of
the
immigration
laws,
to
prevent
violations
of
state
or
federal
law.
why
couldn't
the
attorney
general
impose
any
condition
that's
in
the
public
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
they
are,
in
law,
obliged
to
do
anyway.
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
imposing
a
new
disability
from
work
upon
them,
it
is
simply
requiring
their
commitment
not
to
violate
the
law
by
taking
a
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schey,
what's
fair
depends
upon
what
congress
thinks
is
fair.
and
congress
thinks
that
the
chances
of
the
attorney
general
being
guilty
of
deception
versus
the
chances
of
the
arrestees
being
guilty
of
deception
are
such
that
the
attorney
general
may,
if
he
wishes,
not
grant
any
bond
at
all
and
just
keep
the
person
in
absolute
detention
and
say
never
mind,
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
your
not
working,
i'm
going
to
keep
you
in
detention
until
this
matter
is
cleared
up.
he
could
do
that,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
not
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
not
any
person,
any
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
he's
an
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
read
the
statute
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
also
stated
any
such
alien
taken
into
custody
may
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
and
pending
such
final
determination,
may
be
continued
in
custody.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
it
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
our
statement
in
carlson
v.
landon,
which
you
referred
to
where
it
said
that
the
attorney
general
is
not
left
with
untrammeled
discretion
as
to
bail.
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
we're
talking
about
today.
that
had
to
do
with
the
argument
that
since
what
was
permitted
there
was
simply
the
arrest
of
an
alien
on
the
basis
that
he
was
a
communist.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
keep
somebody
under,
could
you
keep
somebody
in
detention
for
deportation
just
because
he
subscribed
to
the
goals
of
the
communist
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
said
no,
you
couldn't
do
that,
you
had
to
show
that
keeping
him,
that
letting
him
out
he
would
subvert
the
government.
that's
what
it
was
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
was
speaking
to
whether
this
provision
with,
in
1252
means
what
it
says
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
other
supreme
court
decision?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
did
that
involve?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what,
what
was
the
basis
of
deportability?
justice
antonin
scalia
communist
activities
again,
another
communist
activities
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
because
that
would
mean
he's
deportable
just
for
his
political
beliefs
or
maintainable
in
custody
just
for
his
political
beliefs.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
communist
cases
are
a
separate
category
of
case
where
in
order
to
uphold
the
detention
at
all,
you
have
to
establish
something
more
than
the
mere
membership
in
the
communist
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
the
way,
unfortunately,
the
statute
read.
justice
antonin
scalia
(a),
just
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
communist.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
maybe
they
misunderstood
the
statute.
i
mean,
i
think
you
misunderstand
it
and
you're
a
lawyer.
not
all
of
them
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schey,
your
first
example
is,
i
think,
mistaken.
you
said
even
if
you
convinced
him
that
you
were
a
u.s.
citizen.
well,
once
he's
convinced
of
that,
he
would
be
guilty
of
a
violation
because
1252
only
applies
to
an
alien
taken
into
custody.
if
you
persuade
him,
you
know,
that
you're
a
citizen,
you're
in
a
different
category.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
say
to
carlson
and
the
other
supreme
court
case
that
he
cites?
