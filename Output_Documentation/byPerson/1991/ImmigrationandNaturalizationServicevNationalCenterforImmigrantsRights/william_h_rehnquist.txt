in

ins
v.
national

mr.

please
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
marzen.
mr.
schey,
we
will
now
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr....
mr.
schey,
how
then,
if
that's
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
how
do
you
read
8
usc
1252(a)
where
it
says
pending
a
determination
of
deportability,
an
alien
may,
upon
warrant
of
the
attorney
general
be
arrested
and
taken
into
consideration,
and
one
of
the
alternatives
is
that
he
may
be
continued
in
custody?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that,
go
ahead,
how
does
that
bear
on--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
held,
it
held
the
aliens
could
be
detained.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was...
that's
not
the
only
thing
that
subjects
one
to
deportability.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
did
it
enact
this
thing
which
appears
on
its
face
to
grant
the,
grant
the
authority
to
the
attorney
general?
the...
reading
all
the
legislative
history
in
the
world
that
says
congress
wouldn't
have
enacted
it,
doesn't
get
around
the
fact
that
congress
did
enact
this
particular
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
know...
quite
apart
from
what
it
may
authorize
as
the
attorney
general
to
impose
conditions,
it
says
they
may
be
continued
in
custody.
the
attorney
general
need
not
grant
bail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schey.
mr.
marzen,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marzen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
of
the
cases
is
immigration
and
naturalizations
service
versus
national
center
for
immigrants'
rights.
this
case
involves
a
facial
challenge
to
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
it
provides
that
when
an
alien
is
released
from
custody
pending
deportation
or
exclusion
proceedings,
the
bond
issued
to
secure
the
alien's
release
will
generally
include
a
condition
barring
unauthorized
employment
by
the
alien.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
regulation
was
inconsistent
with
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
a
unanimous
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens,
we
hold
that
the
regulation
properly
construed
as
wholly
consistent
with
the
statute.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
