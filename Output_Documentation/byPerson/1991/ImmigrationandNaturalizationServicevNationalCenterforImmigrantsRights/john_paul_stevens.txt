mr.
marzen,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question?
if
the...
and
i
know
you
disagree
with
this
reading,
but
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
correct
that
the
regulation
required
that
the
bond
condition
be
imposed
even
if
the
alien
intended
to
do
authorized
work,
would
that
regulation
be
valid,
be
authorized
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
aliens
in
this
recent
amnesty
program
where
there
was,
where
they
applied
for
amnesty
and
during
a
period
of
time
large
groups
were
eligible
for
work
that
they
might
not
otherwise
have
been
eligible
for,
say,
about
that
group?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
that
work
out
in
the
administration
of
this
bond
condition?
at
the
time
the
bond
is
requested
or
imposed,
is
there
any
prior
determination
of
the
alien's
authority
to
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
in
what
kind
of...
is
this
an
ex
parte
determination
or
does
the
alien
have
any
part
in
the
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
the
alien
doesn't
happen
to
have
the
card
with
him
at
the
time
he's
apprehended,
what
does
he
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
officer
just
decides
whether
or
not
to
ask
for
this
condition
right
there
on
the
spot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
he
just
makes
that...
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
is
there
any
procedural
safeguards
to
be
sure
that
decision
is
made
accurately?
that's,
i
guess,
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
happens
in
doubtful
cases
where
you
can't
really
tell
right
away
and
you
got,
the
bond
request
is
made
right
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he,
in
that
determination,
in
that
hearing,
if
he
demonstrates
that
he
is
authorized
to
work,
then
the
condition
would
be
removed
from
the
bond.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
may
be
wrong,
mr.
marzen,
but
didn't
the
majority
opinion
in
the
carlson
case
suggest
that
anyway
it
had
to
relate
to
some
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
condition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
at
least
that
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
improper
for
it
to
relate
to
some
public
interest
purpose
totally
unrelated
to
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
interrupt
you?
because
i
want
to
be
sure
that
before
you're
through,
you
do
it
at
your
own
time,
but
would
you
comment
on
mr.
marzen's
suggestion
that
really
90-some
percent
of
these
people
voluntarily
depart
and
as
to
the
others
all
they've
got
to
do
is
produce
their
green
card
and
they
will
automatically
avoid
this
bond
condition
under
the
regulation?
and
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
protection
for
those
who
are,
in
fact,
authorized
to
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
category...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
you're
not
concerned
with
so
much
with
cases
where
the
person
is
an
admitted
alien
and
can
therefore
establish
whatever
his
status
as
an
alien
is,
you're
really
concerned
only
with
the
cases
where
the
status
is
between
alienage
and...
citizenship
is
at
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
about
those
two
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
will
not
normally
be,
but
the
language
of
the
regulation
would
seem
to
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that
one
point,
mr.
marzen,
the
regulation
to
which
you
refer
in
the
footnote
16
that
you
cited,
when
was
that
adopted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
after
this
case
began
or
was
it
in
effect
before
the
regulation
was--
