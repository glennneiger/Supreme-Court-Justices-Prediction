mr.
steven
t.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
tamayo-reyes
is
entitled
to
a
federal
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
under
several
enactments
of
congress
and
decisions
of
this
court.
a
hearing
is
critical
in
this
case
in
order
for
the
federal
courts
to
fairly
and
properly
carry
out
their
responsibilities
to
do
justice,
as
the
habeas
corpus
statute
requires.
a
hearing
is
critical
here
so
that
the
federal
court
can
consider
the
information
contained
in
the
affidavit
which
was
obtained
for
the
federal
hearing,
an
affidavit
which
casts
serious
doubt
on
the
accuracy
of
the
interpretation
which
was
provided
by
the
state
to
mr.
tamayo-reyes
at
the
time
that
the
no-contest
plea
was
entered.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
affidavit
does--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
affidavit
in
and
of
itself
is
the
reason
why
we're
entitled
to
a
hearing.
i
believe
that
that
affidavit
is
evidence
which
shows
that
the
hearing
in
the
state
court
did
not
result
in
adequate
development
of
the
facts.
but
even
absent
that
affidavit,
we
have
on
the
meager
record
which
was
created
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding,
the
person
who
was
hired
as
an
interpreter
saying
that
all
he
told
mr.
tamayo-reyes
was
murder
is
killing
someone
without
permission
and
manslaughter
is
less
than
murder.
the
importance
of
the
federal
hearing
would
be
to
more
fully
develop
the
manner
in
which
the
interpretation
defect
did
not
convey
what
is
required
in
order
for
a
person
to
understand
the
mens
rea
elements.
the
standards
under
which
mr.
tamayo-reyes
is
seeking
a
hearing
have
been
in
effect
for
nearly
30
years...
standards
which
were
set
out
in
townsend
and
adopted
at
least
twice
by
enactments
of
congress,
standards
which
have
provided
strong
protection
to
state
interests
during
that
time.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not
and
perhaps
cannot
change
what
congress
has
enacted.
moreover,
we
submit
that
as
a
policy
matter,
no
change
is
needed
because
very
few
hearings
are
in
fact
held
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
and
because
the
entire
scheme
of
the
law
in
the
habeas
area
provides
very
strong
protection
to
state
interests,
not
only
through
the
townsend
standard,
but
also
through
the
exhaustion
requirements
and
the
separate
presumption
of
correctness
which
would
apply
once
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
held.
the
question
presented
here,
as
distinguished
from
the
question
presented
in
mccleskey,
coleman,
and
all
of
the
other
cases
in
which
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
has
been
adopted,
is
not
whether
the
federal
courts
should
exercise
their
jurisdiction
but
how
the
federal
courts
should
carry
out
their
functions
once
they
have
made
the
decision
that
the
door
to
the
courthouse
should
be
opened.
the
interests
of
the
federal
courts
and
of
the
federal
government
in
that
situation
are
distinct
from
the
interests
which
apply
and
which
have
been
balanced
in
those
areas
when
this
court
has
concluded
that
state
interests
are
sufficiently
strong
so
that
the
courthouse
door
should
not
be
opened.
what
the
state
is
seeking
here
is
a
rule
which
ignores
those
distinctions
and
which
would
push
the
pendulum
of
federalism
too
far
toward
the
interests
of
the
states
and
intrude
on
the
function
which
is
inherent
in
the
federal
bench
in
carrying
out
its
responsibilities.
as
we
take
a
more
detailed
look
at
the
issues
and
interests
which
are
applicable
here,
i
believe
that
we
see
at
least
three
separate
lines
of
argument
which
support
the
position
which
mr.
tamayo-reyes
is
advancing.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
they're
a
little
of
each,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i
believe
that
there
are
very
strong
statutory
arguments
which
are
evident
from
a
review
of
the
entire
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme,
not
only
section
2254.
as
part
of
that
statutory
scheme,
i
will
refer
to
the
rules
promulgated
in
1976
and
'77.
the
second
tier
of
argument
involves
the
interests
which
are
at
stake
in
this
situation,
as
distinguished
from
the
interests
at
stake
in
mccleskey
or
the
wainwright-type
of
situation.
and
third,
we
have
the
multileveled
interests...
protections
to
the
state
interest
which
exist
through
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
the
presumption
of
correctness.
in
looking
at
the
statutory
scheme,
i
believe
that
it
is
critical
to
examine
not
only
what
congress
did
in
section
2254
in
1966,
but
also
what
it
did
in
section
2244
and
did
not
do
in
section
2254.
in
1966,
congress
created
a
presumption
of
finality
in
section
2244.
congress
concluded
that
when
a
successive
petition
is
filed
it
is
appropriate
to
preclude
additional
evidentiary
review.
congress
did
not
import
that
same
concept
of
finality
into
section
2254.
to
the
contrary,
in
section
2254,
congress
created
an
evidentiary
rule
which
would
be
applicable
once
the
hearing
was
being
held.
at
the
same
time,
in
section
2241,
congress
expanded
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
so
that
the
evidentiary
hearings
which
congress
was
clearly
contemplating
would
take
place
under
the
decisions
which
were
handed
down
in
1963...
could
take
place
in
a
more
convenient
form.
so
that
the
entire
scheme
as
enacted
in
1966
is
replete
with
reference
to
hearings.
and
indeed,
when
congress
passed
section
2254
and
established
the
presumption
of
correctness,
it
assumed
and
built
on
and
around
the
standard
which
had
been
set
down
in
townsend.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
no,
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not.
however--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
say
that
because
congress
used
the
identical
language
that
was
used
in
townsend.
and
when
congress
took
the
language
from
the
townsend
decision
and
imported
it
into
the
statute,
congress
took
with
it
what
this
court
had
said
those
words
meant
in
townsend.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
in
the
legislative
history,
which
appears
in
both
the
1964
house
report
and
again
in
the
1966
reports,
one
finds
congress
specifically
adverting
to
the
decision
in
townsend.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
no,
that
specific
language
does
not
appear.
however,
the
action
that
congress
took
in
2244
and
2241
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that,
under
townsend,
congress
thought
at
that
time,
that
there
would
be
more
evidentiary
hearings
than
had
occurred
previously.
now,
it's
turned
out
that
they
were
wrong,
and
in
fact,
the
number
of
hearings
has
decreased
dramatically.
but
when
they
acted,
they
said
in
the
portions
of
the
legislative
history
which
are
more
applicable
perhaps
to
section
2241,
we
need
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
because
under
townsend
there
will
be
more
hearings.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
i
believe
that
it
does
not.
i
believe
that
existence
of
the
exhaustion
requirement
in
the
statute,
and
as
that
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
provides
significant
protection
to
the
state.
the
exhaustion
requirement
precludes
a
petitioner
from
coming
into
the
federal
court
and
significantly
reformulating
his
claims.
if,
however,
the
exhaustion
requirement
were
read
to
preclude
a
petitioner
from
offering
any
new
fact...
and
i
submit
that
the
state's
position
is
not
just...
would
not
be
limited,
if
adopted
as
they
set
it
out,
to
subsection
(3),
but
would
eliminate
the
ability
to
present
any
new
fact
which
they
call
material
in
any
situation.
that
would
in
essence
convert
federal
habeas
into
an
appellate
process.
perhaps
that
is
what
they
want.
but
i
submit
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
requires
the
petitioner
to
come
in
on
the
same
claim,
but
to
give
the
federal
court
the
benefit
of,
as
in
this
case,
and
as
in
the
first
mccleskey
and
as
in
vasquez
and
as
in
townsend
itself,
the
benefit
of
an
expert's
assistance
in
understanding
what
the
facts
were.
and
in
this
case,
that's
in
essence
all
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
we
are
not
urging
a
rule
which
would
permit
a
petitioner
to
come
in
a
do
that
without
showing
the
absence
of
the
deliberate
bypass.
my
understanding
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
all
of
the
circuit
courts
which
have
analyzed
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
that
the
federal
habeas
petitioner
has
historically
and
properly
been
permitted
to
come
into
the
federal
court
and
offer
something
new.
if
the
rule
were
the
same
as
you've
indicated
exists
in
the
administrative
law
area,
there
would
be
no
federal
habeas
corpus
hearings.
if
we
had
to
present
every
fact
to
the
state
court,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
hearing.
come
in
and
argue,
but
you
would
never
present--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--i
believe...
i'm
not
sure
though
whether
justice
scalia's
comment,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
would
extend
or
could
extend
to
precluding
a
hearing
even
if
cause
and
prejudice
were
shown.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
most
of
the
discussion
of
exhaustion
comes
up
in
the
context
of
having
presented
a
claim
to
the
state
court
and
not
coming
into
federal
court
and
significantly
changing
the
claim.
i'm
not
aware,
and
this
may
be
a
failing
in
my
research,
of
any
cases
which
have
interpreted
the
exhaustion
requirement
to
preclude
the
offering
of
facts
under
a
deliberate
bypass
or
any
other
standard.
vasquez
v.
hillery,
i
submit,
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
from
this
case.
and
in
vasquez,
petitioner
was
permitted
to
come
into
federal
court
and
offer
a
better
expert's
opinion.
the
same
was
true
in
mccleskey
i.
indeed
the
same
was
true,
as
i
indicated,
in
townsend.
and
i
believe
that
historically
that
is
what
we
find.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
existence
of
2254(d)
assumes
the
type
of
standard
that
was
set
up
in
townsend.
if
they
are
seen
as
applying
at
separate
stages
of
the
proceeding,
so
that
one
would
have
to
first
overcome
townsend
before
getting
a
hearing,
then
in
that
hearing
have
to
overcome
the
presumption.
i
think
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
enacted
a
very
difficult
evidentiary
presumption
for
a
petitioner
to
overcome,
based
on
the
type
of
standard
which
would
be
applied
in
the
first
instance
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
hearing
should
be
held.
if
the
presumption
of
correctness
as
it
applies
in
2254(d)
is
made
more
difficult
for
a
petitioner
to
overcome,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
be
undoing
what
congress
set
out
to
do
when
it
enacted
that
statute.
if
we
can't
get
a
hearing
unless
cause
and
prejudice
is
shown,
congress'
desire
to
provide
protection
through
the
presumption
of
correctness
is
less
necessary.
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
take
that
step.
in
addition
to
the
statute,
however,
i
believe
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
rules
which
were
adopted
in
1976
and
'77.
rule
8
in
particular,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
rule
8,
again,
make
reference
to
townsend.
and
those
rules,
as
are
the
statutes,
are
full
of
reference
to
evidentiary
hearings.
they
are
built
on
the
assumption
that
habeas
corpus
is
not
an
appellate
process
and
that
hearings
will
be
held.
and
the
fact
that
congress
adopted
those
rules
in
1976
with
knowledge
of,
we
have
to
assume,
what
they
meant,
and
with
the
advisory
committee
report
available
to
it,
provides
further
evidence
that
the
townsend
language
has
been
adopted.
in
addition,
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
have
called
section
2254(d)
a
codification
of
townsend.
i
recognize
that
there
is
some
dispute
in
the
case
law
about
that.
however,
in
a
number
of
decisions,
including
decisions
in
the
last
several
years,
this
court
has
used
that
language.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
court
has
recognized
that
section
2254(d)
codified
townsend,
the
state
is
not
only
asking
you
to
overrule
townsend,
but
also
to
revisit
a
number
of
other
cases
in
which
that
position
has
been
stated.
in
looking
at
the
decision
in
mccleskey,
which
was
handed
down
last
term,
the
state
says
that
it
is
indistinguishable.
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
not
only
distinguishable,
but
the
analysis
which
the
court
undertook
in
that
case
supports
the
position
that
mr.
tamayo-reyes
is
taking
here.
first,
mccleskey
specifically
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
changing
the
law,
and
that
what
was
being
stated
in
that
case
was
consistent
with
the
historical
decisions
of
the
court
in
the
area.
that
is
clearly
not
the
situation
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
second,
in
mccleskey,
the
court
acknowledged
that
that
was
an
area
in
which
the
court
had
taken
the
lead,
and
in
which
congress'
enactments
had
not
been
intended
to
preclude
further
judicial
development
of
the
law.
that
is
distinguishable
from
this
situation
in
which
the
entire
history
of
congressional
enactments
in
the
area
of
habeas
corpus
is
replete
with
evidentiary
hearing
language.
third,
mccleskey
saw
a
very
close
parallel
between
the
question
of
inadequate
and
independent
state
ground,
which
underlies
the
cause
and
prejudice
analysis,
and
the
procedural
default
which
occurs
in
the
successive
petition
area.
here
we
do
not
have
a
procedural
default.
to
the
extent
that
the
state
was
attempting
to
suggest
in
its
reply
brief
that
oregon
law
might
consider
this
situation
a
procedural
default
situation,
it
is
important
to
look
not
only
to
the
rules
which
they
have
cited,
but
in
addition,
rule
71
of
the
oregon
rules
of
civil
procedure.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
oregon
courts
have
in
some
areas
adopted
the
townsend
and
fay
language.
rule
71
of
the
oregon
rules
of
civil
procedure
provides
for
relief
from
judgment
under
certain
circumstances.
and
those
circumstances
include
mistake,
inadvertence,
surprise,
or
excusable
neglect.
and
i
submit
that
the
entire
oregon
statutory
scheme,
if
it
is
applicable
at
all...
and
i
don't
know
that
that
is
clear
in
this
situation...
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
procedural
default.
the
state
court
reached
the
merits,
decided
the
case
on
the
merits,
and
that
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
types
of
cases
in
which
cause
and
prejudice
has
been
applied.
the
mccleskey
decision
is
distinguishable
for
yet
another
reason.
in
looking
at
section
2244(b),
one
finds
a
compound
standard.
congress
has
indicated
that
a
successive
petition
can
be
precluded
if
a
claim
was
deliberately
withheld
or
a
petitioner
otherwise
abused
the
writ.
to
the
extent
that
the
discussion
in
mccleskey
looked
at
the
statutory
language,
it
would
have
been
focusing
perhaps
on
both
sections.
the
fact
that
congress
has
in
it
otherwise
abuse
the
writ
makes
it
very
clear
that
congress
was
not
intending
to
limit
this
court's
authority
to
continue
to
define
when
an
abuse
of
the
writ
should
be
found.
mccleskey
is
further
distinguishable
because
here
we
have
an
entire
statutory
scheme
to
inform
the
discussion
about
when
a
hearing
should
be
held.
there,
nothing
similar
exists
to
the
language
which
we
have
in
2241,
2243,
44,
and
most
of
the
statutory
and
rule
provisions.
when
the
state
suggests
that
the
policy
which
has
led
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
should
be
applied
is
applicable
here,
we
submit
that
they
overlook
several
important
distinctions.
one
of
the
most
important
is
the
interest
that
the
federal
court
has
in
being
able
to
faithfully
carry
out
its
responsibilities
when
the
door
is
opened.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
it
is
certainly
correct
that
they
have
the
discretion
to
do
so.
if
however,
this
court
adopts
the
rule
which
the
state
is
suggesting,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
that
discretion
could
be
removed.
and
if
the
court
is
to
focus
on
the
circumstances
set
out
in
townsend
in
which
a
hearing
is
mandatory
and
addressed
only
that
question,
the
discretion
arguably
would
remain
unlimited.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
i
believe
that
it
does
since
townsend
says
that
a
hearing
is
mandatory
in
the
six
enumerated
circumstances,
but
is
discretionary
in
any
other--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--the
reality,
i'm
afraid,
is
that
that
works
against
us
because
the
district
judges
are
not,
in
my
experience,
exercising
their
discretion
in
that
way.
they
are
looking
to
the
first
part
of
townsend
and,
in
most
instances,
not
looking
to
the
fact
that
there
is
discretion
available.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
yes,
it
would.
when
viewed
in
that
way,
it
certainly
would.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
that
is
correct.
the
discretion
is,
as
you've
indicated,
as
i
understand
the
statute--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--yes.
in
looking
at
the
decision
in
coleman,
one
finds
further
support
for
mr.
tamayo-reyes,
because
in
that
decision
the
court
noted
that
the
costs
in
the
federalism
calculus
are
particularly
high
when
a
procedural
default
has
occurred.
and
that
recognition,
i
submit,
is
applicable
here
and
further
underscores
the
fact
that
in
balancing
the
federal/state
interests
in
this
situation,
the
interest
of
the
states
are
adequately
protected.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
complete
my
argument
and
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
