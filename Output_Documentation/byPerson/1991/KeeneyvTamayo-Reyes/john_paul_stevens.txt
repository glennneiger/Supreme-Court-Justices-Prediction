mr.
landau,
can
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question?
you're
making
a
policy
argument
in
favor
of
your
position
that
may
make
a
lot
of
sense.
do
you
think
that...
your
position
does
require
overruling
a
portion
of
townsend.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about...
how
consistent
is
your
position
with
subsection
(d)(3)
of
2254?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
successive
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
not
a
successive
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
why
that
section
should
inform
the
problem
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
same
strict
standards
that
apply
to
second
habeas
petitions
should
apply
to
first
habeas
petitions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
they're
interpreting
different
statute.
they're
interpreting
the
successive
petition
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
you
started
to
refer
to
a
second
statute
and
never
quite
got
to
it,
i
think,
in
answer
to
one
of
my
earlier
questions.
is
there
a
statutory
provision
that
directs
itself
at
the
question
whether
a
hearing
shall
be
held?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
all
we
have
is
the
law
as
interpreted
in
townsend
and
the
question
is
whether
to
revise
judge-made
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
have
a
second
statutory
provision
you
wanted
to
mention
to
me
earlier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
even
cite
it
in
your
reply
brief.
it's
not
in
your
statutory
authorities.
it's
in
your
principal
brief.
it's
cited
in
your
principal
brief,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
justice
stevens
has
a
question.
it
isn't
that
turning
them
into
trial
is
the
main
event,
right?
the
question
here
is
whether
the
first
state
collateral
proceeding
was
it.
and
that's
not
the
main
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
same
reason
it
applies
to
the
main
event
also
applies
to
the
second
most
important
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
discretion
described
in
fay
v.
noia
was
not
discretion
to
hold
a
hearing.
it
was
discretion
to
grant
relief.
it
was
discretion
to
deny
relief.
there's
no
suggestion
in
fay
v.
noia
that
that
standard
applies
to
whether
or
not
a
hearing
should
be
held.
and
there's
no
talk
about
discretion
in
townsend
except
discretion
to
hold
additional
hearings
other
than
those
that
fit
the
six
categories.
nothing
about
discretion
to
deny
a
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
grant
hearings
for
additional
reasons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
incentive
provided
by
the
natural
desire
of
a
person
in
prison
to
try
to
get
out
as
soon
as
possible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
arguing
for...
the
rule
you're
arguing
for
is
really
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoners,
to
make
sure
they
make
their
cases
as
promptly
as
they
can.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
just
means
it'll
benefit
those
prisoners
who
deserve
to
get
off.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
will
not
benefit
those
who
don't
deserve
to
get
off,
because
in
those
cases,
bad
memory
is
a
positive
advantage,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
to
judge
for
yourself
which
percentage
is
the
higher,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
