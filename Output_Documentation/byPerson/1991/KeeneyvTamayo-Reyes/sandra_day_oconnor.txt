well,
of
course,
in
all
those
other
instances,
i
suppose
it
is
true
that
we
could
look
to
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
as
the
basis
for
the
procedural
bar
and
so
forth.
that
is
not
present
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course
one
other
concern
might
be
that
here
the
federal
court
has
agreed
to
entertain
the
legal
issue.
the
federal
court
is
going
to
hear
that
issue
and
decide
it
on
habeas.
and
maybe
the
federal
court
should...
maybe
it's
desirable
that
it
be
decided
based
on
all
the
facts
as
they
could
be
developed
rather
than
simply
on
the
record
below.
i
think
there
are
some
differences
here
that
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with.
