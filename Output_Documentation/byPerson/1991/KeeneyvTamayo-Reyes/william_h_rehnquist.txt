we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-1859,
j.c.
keeney
v.
jose
tamayo-reyes.
mr.
landau.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying,
basically,
is
that
there's
going
to
be
some
form
of
waiver
under
section
3
anyway.
that...
you
say
it
should
be
based
on
cause
and
prejudice;
your
opponent
says
it
should
be
based
on
deliberate
bypass.
nobody
says,
i
take
it,
that
a
federal
habeas
petitioner
can
come
into
federal
court
after
a
state
hearing
and
say
the
material
facts
were
not
adequately
developed
in
the
state
court,
period,
without
having
any
inquiry
made
as
to
what
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
were
and
what
position
he
took.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
section
is
it
that
the
question
and
your
answers
have
just
been
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
landau.
mr.
wax,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
these
basically
policy
arguments,
mr.
wax,
or
are
they
based
on
the
statute
or
our
cases?
or
are
they
a
little
of
each?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
mr.
wax,
when
you
look
at
subsection
(3),
which
is
and
exception,
i
guess,
to
the
presumption
of
correctness,
and
there
that
the
material
facts
were
not
adequately
developed
at
the
state
court
hearing.
i
mean,
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that
section
as
written
doesn't
say
anything
about
either
cause
and
prejudice
or
about
deliberate
bypass,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
both
of
those
are
really
judicially
created
modifications
or
amendments
to
that
section
of
the
statute.
you
concede
that
there's
some
form
of
waiver
here.
you
say
it's
deliberate
bypass.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
do
you
say
that
since
the
only
thing
they
took
from
townsend
was
this
particular
phrase
with
no
reference
to
any
concept
of
waiver?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
find
them
specifically
adverting
to
deliberate
bypass?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
show
cause
and
prejudice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
entitled
to
answer
him
on
his
hypothesis.
i
think
petitioner's
submission
says
cause
and
prejudice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wax.
mr.
landau,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
landau.
the
case
is
submitted.
