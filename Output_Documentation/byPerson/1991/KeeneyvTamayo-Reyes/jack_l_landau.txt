mr.
jack
l.
landau
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
straightforward
question
of
when
a
habeas
petitioner
who
failed
to
fully
develop
the
facts
of
his
case
in
a
state
post-conviction
proceeding
is
nevertheless
entitled
to
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
that
federal
hearing
only
when
he
can
demonstrate
cause
for
his
failure
to
present
his
evidence
and
prejudice
that
results.
my
argument
this
afternoon
will
focus
on
two
propositions
in
support
of
that
conclusion.
first,
that
cause
and
prejudice
is
required
in
this
case
because
of
the...
because
the
court's
recent
decisions
requiring
the
application
of
that
test
in
other
circumstances
are
not
distinguishable
here.
second,
that
section
2254(d)
of
the
1966
federal
habeas
act
does
not
preclude
the
adoption
of
a
cause
and
prejudice
standard
under
these
circumstances.
the
statute
does
not
address
the
question
of
whether
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
required,
but
rather
the
weight
that
must
be
given
to
state
fact-findings
when
the
hearing
is
to
be
held.
before
turning
to
those
contentions,
let
me
briefly
recount
the
factual
context
for
those
contentions.
jose
tamayo-reyes
was
charged
in
state
court
with
the
crime
of
murder.
in
accordance
with
a
plea
agreement,
he
agreed
to
plead
no
contest
to
the
lesser
charge
of
manslaughter.
ten
months
later,
tamayo-reyes
filed
a
state
post-conviction
petition
challenging
the
voluntariness
of
that
plea.
the
state
post-conviction
court
gave
him
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
all
of
the
evidence
that
he
thought
should
be
before
the
court
on
that
issue.
he
now
says
that
he
didn't
develop
that
record
as
completely
as
he
should
have
and
that
he
would
like
to
supplement
that
record
through
a
federal
court
evidentiary
hearing.
the
federal
court
denied
his
request
for
petition...
or
request
for
the
evidentiary
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
that
tamayo-reyes
received
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
but
nevertheless
reversed
a
holding
that
the
district
court
should
have
applied
the
rule
of
townsend
v.
sain,
which
requires
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing
as
long
as
the
petitioner's
failure
to
develop
the
facts
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding
was
not
deliberate.
thus,
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
means
that
once
petitioners
raise
their
claims,
they
are
not
responsible
for
failing
to
fully
develop
this
claims
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding,
unless
they
did
so
as
the
result
of
conscious,
considered,
deliberate
decision.
in
all
other
cases...
he
forgot,
he
failed
to
discover
evidence
that
was
reasonably
available
to
him,
or
anything
other...
virtually
anything
other
than
a
tactical
decision...
his
failure
to
develop
those
facts
at
the
state
court
proceeding
requires
the
federal
court
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
precise
question
before
this
court,
then,
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
and
whether
townsend's
deliberate
bypass
rule
is
still
good
law.
turning
to
our
first
proposition,
that
cause
and
prejudice--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
there
was
no--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jack
l.
landau
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
returning
to
our
first
proposition
that
cause
and
prejudice
and
not
mere
deliberate
bypass
must
be
applied
in
this
case,
i
suppose
the
short
answer
is
that
townsend
borrowed
the
deliberate
bypass
test
from
fay
v.
noia,
which
was
decided
the
same
day.
fay
v.
noia,
however,
has
since
been
limited
in
a
number
of
decisions,
and
was
ultimately
overruled
this
last
term
in
coleman
v.
thompson.
the
basis
for
townsend's
deliberate
bypass
standard,
then,
is
gone.
and
so
also,
we
argue,
should
the
rule
itself.
there
are,
however,
more
fundamental
reasons
for
rejecting
the
deliberate
bypass
standard
in
this
case
than
the
overruling
of
fay
v.
noia.
the
court
rejected
the
deliberate
bypass
test
in
that
case
and
criticized
it
in
other
cases
for
good
reasons.
and
those
underlying
reasons
apply
with
equal
force
here.
in
those
cases,
the
court
addressed
the
question
of
whether
deliberate
bypass
or
cause
and
prejudice
should
apply
where
habeas
petitions...
petitioners
fail
to
raise
claims,
fail
to
appeal,
or
fail
to
conform
to
any
number
of
other
state
procedural
rules.
the
same
principle
must
apply
here
where
the
issue
is
whether
or
when
to
grant
a
state
habeas
petitioner
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
this
is
so
for
at
least
three
reasons.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
justice
o'connor,
it
is
true
that
the
court
has
looked
at
the
policies
that
underlie
the
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
in
some
of
its
decisions,
though
not
all,
in
those
decisions
in
which
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
is
adopted.
in
the
davis
case,
in
the
francis
case,
in
a
number
of
others,
the
court
has
applied
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
for
different
reasons.
having
said
that,
we
would
still
submit
that
the
policies
that
are
underlying
the
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
test
that
were
applied
in
those
other
cases
apply
here
as
well.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
my
response
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
would
be
that
federal
habeas
petitioners
get
a
single
opportunity
to
make
their
factual
record
or
show
cause
for
failure
to
do
so,
as
this
court
held
in
the
mccleskey
case
just
this
last
term.
why
should
state
petitioners
be
treated
differently
and
have
an
easier
time
of
obtaining
the
second
evidentiary
hearing?
as
this
court
said
in
the
francis
case
when
considering
whether
or
not
to
adopt
the
deliberate...
or
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
that
it
had
in
davis,
we
shouldn't
be
treating
state
and
federal
petitioners
differently.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
true,
justice
kennedy.
but
the
question
in
that
case
was
the
extent
to
which
you
get
a
successive
habeas--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--absolutely.
and
that,
we
believe
is
one
of
the
most
important
reasons
why
there
should
be
a
cause
and
prejudice
test
applied
in
this
circumstance
and
cases
like
it,
so
that
there
is
the
proper
incentive
for
petitioners
to
develop
the
facts
at
the
first
opportunity,
which
is
the
state
petition.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
well,
as
the
court
has
observed
repeatedly
in
its
cause
and
prejudice
tests,
one
of
the
most
important
defects
of
the
deliberate
bypass
test
is
that
it
fails
to
pay
proper
respect
to
the
state's
role
in
the
overall
criminal
adjudication
process.
this
consideration
is
what
underlies
all
of
those
cases.
it
should
apply
here.
why,
for
example,
should
we
require
habeas
petitioners
to
raise
a
claim
and
then
not
require
them
to
offer
all
the
evidence
in
support
of
that
claim?
what's
the
purpose
of
having
them
raise
that
claim
if
not
to
offer
all
the
evidence
in
support
of
that
claim
at
one
time?
the
consequences
of
failing
to
treat
those
two
situations
is
the
same,
whether
we're
talking
about
the
difference...
the
similarities
between
failure
to
raise
a
claim
and
to
provide
all
your
evidence,
or
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
in
the
question
that
you
put
to
me,
is
more
than
rhetorical.
and
that
is
because
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
is
the
state
court
that
is
the
best
place
to
develop
the
factual
record.
the
state
court
hearing
is
the
closest
in
time
to
the
factual
events
that
are
the
heart
of
these
petitions.
the
witnesses
are
available.
they
have
fresh
memories.
the
court
sees
all
of
them
at
once,
not
piecemeal
over
the
course
of
6,
8,
or
10
years.
and
the
state
court
is
best
able
to
see
how
all
those
parts
fit
into
a
coherent
whole.
so
accuracy,
efficiency,
and
justice
on
the
part
of
all
parties
involved
in
the
system
are
served
by
having
the
factual
record
developed
as
early
as
possible
in
the
state
court.
deliberate
bypass
works
against
those
interests.
it
provides,
we
submit,
insufficient
incentive
for
petitioners
to
develop
as
fully
as
they
can
the
record
in
the
post-conviction
hearing.
excuse
me.
this
in
turn
imposes
costs
on
both
the
federal
and
state
components
of
this
partnership
that
is
the
joint
federal
and
state
criminal
justice
system.
for
example,
it
wastes
the
resources
of
the
state
and
frustrates
their
attempt
to
come
to
the
right
decision
based
on
all
the
evidence
that
is
before
it.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
i'd
be
happy
to
turn
to
that
portion
of
my
argument,
justice
stevens.
it
is
true
that
the
respondent,
tamayo-reyes,
has
argued
that
in
enacting
the
statute
in
1966,
specifically
section
2254(d),
that
congress
somehow
adopted
the
deliberate
bypass
test
of
townsend.
we
think
that's
incorrect.
the
statute
and
townsend
serve
related
but
very
different
purposes.
townsend
identifies
the
situations
in
which
the
federal
courts
are
required
to
offer
petitioners
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
statute,
by
way
of
contrast,
section
2254(d),
defines
the
weight
that
must
be
given
the
state
court
determinations.
those
are
two
different
functions.
and
so
to
say
that
one
adopts
the
other
is,
if
you'll
excuse
the
colloquialism,
mixing
apples
and
oranges.
if
it's...
even
if
it's
assumed
that
the
act
somehow
bore
on
this
situation,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
the
only
possible
standard
that
could
be
drawn
from
that
is
the
cause
and
prejudice
statute.
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
the
other
two
sections
that
relate
to
additional
evidentiary
hearings
in
the
same
enactment
in
the
1966
act,
they
require
a
cause-type
standard,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
congress
would
not
apply
the
similar
standard
in
the
similar
circumstance.
section
2244(b),
for
example...
this
is
the
statute,
the
successive
petition
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
mccleskey...
defines
the
extent
to
which
successive
federal
habeas
petitions
can
be
filed,
and
provides
that
new
grounds
will
not
be
allowed
unless
the
petitioner
can
establish
cause
and
prejudice.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
as
this
court
said
in
brown
v.
allen,
the
same
policies
that
underlie
the
successive
petition
sections
also
inform
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
this
is
true.
that's
correct.
what
we're
talking
about
is
trying
to
provide
incentives
for
petitioners
to
bring
all
their
evidence
to
court
as
early
as
possible
so
that
the
court
that
is
hearing
this
matter
in
the
first
instance
can
make
its
decision
based
on
the
best
record
possible.
and
to
the
extent
that
you
allow
petitioners,
or
that
you
provide
less
incentive
for
petitioners
to
do
that,
you
frustrate
the
process.
you
frustrate
the
state
court's
ability
to
arrive
at
a
correct
decisions.
you
also
frustrate
the
federal
court.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
kennedy,
but
what...
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think
it
works
in
the
following
way.
if
you
have
a
townsend-type
case,
if
you
have
any
of
the
eight
circumstances
listed
in
the
statute,
there
is
no
presumption
of
correctness
attached
to
the
state
court
fact-finding.
what
that...
and
in
all
other
cases,
the
find...
the
presumption
of
correctness
does
attach.
to
the
extent
that
the
presumption
does
not
attach,
it
is
only
to
the
findings.
and
so
the
court
in
a
proceeding
can
evaluate
the
evidence
that
is
before
it
in
the
factual
record
developed
below,
and
render
its
independent
decision,
draw
its
own
legal
conclusions
from
the
historical
facts
that
are
on
that
record.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
i'm
sorry,
i'll
have
to
take
a
look
at
my
statute
here.
i'm
not
sure
where
it
is
that
you
are
reading
from.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
oh,
certainly,
that
is
one
of
the--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--yes,
and
if
the
facts
were
not
adequately
developed
under
townsend,
and
if,
depending
on
what
standards
you
apply
under
townsend,
you
determine
whether
or
not
there
will
be
a
hearing.
once
it
is
determined
that
there
will
be
a
hearing,
then
you
have
to
determine
what
the
evidentiary
presumption
will
be
with
respect
to
the
state
court
factual
findings.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that's
correct.
and
what
that
means
is,
your
honor,
that
the
state
court
may
not
presume
that
the
state
court
determination,
the
conclusions
that
were
drawn
by
the
state
court,
that
those
are
no
longer
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctness.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that's
correct.
well,
no.
if...
to
the
extent
that
it
applies
to
this
case,
it
is
only
if
the
court
determines
in
the
first
instance,
by
applying
townsend,
that
there
will,
in
fact,
be
a
hearing.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
neither
party
are
taking
issue
with
that.
it
is
a
given
that
the
court
will
need
under
townsend
to
apply
either
the
deliberate
bypass
test
that
was
expressed
in
townsend,
or
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
which
we
are
proposing
here.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
precisely.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
as
i
said,
they
are
related,
but
they
serve
distinctly
different
purposes.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
correct.
it
does
have
an
option--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--correct.
correct.
and
i
think
that's
borne
out
by
the
second
paragraph
of
the
statute,
which
provides
that
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
a
proceeding,
this
is
how
you
rebut
the
presumption.
this
is
how
you
offer
evidence
to
controvert
the
presumption.
the
first
portion
of
the
statute
refers
to
those
cases
where
there
is
no
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
i
will
grant
you
that
distinction.
my
point,
though,
is
simply
that
the
policies
that
undergirded
the
court's
decision
in
mccleskey
i
think
are
applicable
here.
trying
to--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
whether
a
hearing
shall
be
held
for
state...
petitioners
who
had
a
state
hearing?
mr.
jack
l.
landau
no,
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
certainly.
my
first
point
was
that
the
successive
petition
statute,
as
interpreted
in
mccleskey,
requires
a
finding
of
cause.
i
also
wanted
to
point
out
that
the...
there's
a
second
section,
2244(c),
in
the
same
enactment,
also
requires
a
cause-type
standard.
under
that
subsection,
if
this
court
reviews
a
state
court
judgment,
then
its
resolution
of
the
state
defendant's
federal
claim
is
conclusive
unless
the
defendant
can
show
that
the
facts
he
or
she
wishes
to
add
to
the
record
were
not
known
despite
the
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence.
and
i
will
grant
that
it
doesn't
say
cause
and
prejudice,
but
i
think
the
import
of
that
is
that
the
petitioner
must
exercise
some
reasonable
diligence,
must
take
responsibility,
must
explain
the
failure
to
offer
the
evidence
in
the
first
instance.
and
my
point
was
simply
that
if
you
accept
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
statute
even
does
speak
to
the
question
of
when
there
is
a
hearing,
it
only
makes
sense
to
apply
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
because
it
is
applied
in
the
same
enactment.
it
was
all
part
of
a
package
in
1966,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
yes,
it
is.
it's
certainly
in
the
reply
brief
in
the
section
in
which
we
discuss--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--actually,
i
don't
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
we
actually
set
forth
the
text
of
that
section.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
beg
your
pardon
for
not
doing
that.
the
point,
though,
i
think,
as
i
tried
to
mention
just
a
minute
ago,
is
that
these
were
part
of
a
package
in
1966,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
congress
would
require
a
deliberate
bypass
under
section
2254(d),
but
a
cause-type
standard
in
the
others.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
thank
you.
returning
to
the--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--sections
28
u.s.
c,
section
2244(b)
and
(c).
mr.
jack
l.
landau
returning
to
our
discussion
of
the
policies
that
have
undergirded
the
court's
recent
decisions
on
cause
and
prejudice
and
our
contention
that
those
same
policies
apply
here,
a
second
failing
of
deliberate
bypass
that
this
court
has
observed
is
that
the
deliberate
bypass
test
pays
insufficient
attention
to
the
state's
interest
in
obtaining
finality
to
criminal
litigation.
if
the
state
criminal
justice
system
is
to
have
any
credibility,
if
it's
to
have
any
deterrent
effect
at
all,
it
must
be
in
the
certainty
that
final
judgment
will
be
rendered,
and
that
the
convicted
criminals
can't
litigate
and
relitigate
the
facts
underlying
those
convictions.
the
same
has
to
be
said
here.
nearly
every
state
post-conviction
case
could
have
been
tried
differently.
what
trial
lawyer
doesn't
complete
a
trial
only
to
think
of
some
point
forgotten,
or
some
material
question
not
answered?
it
is
in
fact
hard
to
imagine
a
prisoner
who
could
not
come
up
with
an
additional
fact
to
offer
in
a
subsequent
hearing.
and
the...
if
anything,
the
application
of
the
deliberate
bypass
in
this
case
creates
precisely
the
situation
that
the
court
observed
must
be
avoided,
and
that
is
turning
the
state
court
hearing
from
the
main
event
to
a
try-out.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
what
i'm
arguing
here
is
that
the
same
reasoning
that
applied
with
respect
to
that
comment,
trying
to
get
resolution--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--that's
correct.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
following
up
on
mr.
wax's
remarks.
first,
he
has
referred
to
the
record
to
demonstrate
the
deficiency
of
the
state
court
hearing
and
the
necessity
for
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
i
want
to
refer
to
that
bit
of
the
record
as
well
because
i
think
it
makes
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
or
that
i
tried
to
make
in
my
opening
remarks.
if
you
take
a
look
at
that
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
deposition
of
the
interpreter
indicates
not
that
the
translation
was
in
anyway
inadequate,
it
demonstrates
that
he
didn't
have
a
very
good
memory
at
that
point
2
years
after
the
fact.
how
much
more
so,
i
would
submit,
would
he
have
that
problem,
were
the
evidence
to
be
adduced
some
6
years
in
addition
after
that,
or
8
years
after
the
fact?
that
is
the
very
point
that
we
are
asserting
here,
is
that
there
needs
to
be
built
into
this
system
incentives
for
petitioners
to
put
all
of
their
evidence
in
at
the
earliest
possible
point
so
that
the
witnesses,
whose
recollections
are
fresh,
or
as
fresh
as
possible
at
the
time,
can
have
that
evidence.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
justice
stevens,
there's
no
question
that
there
is
that
incentive
that
works
in
the
system.
our
concern
is
that
the
application
of
the
deliberate
bypass
works
against
that
and
that
the
cause
and
prejudice
tests
provides
the
kind
of
further
incentive
that
would
ensure
that
the
record
is--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--i
think,
as
i
said
in
my
opening
remark,
that
adoption
of
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
ultimately
will
benefit
the
prisoners
because
it
will
promote
the
ability
of
the
federal/state
fact-finders
to
make
accurate
decisions
as
early
on
in
the
process.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
that's
true.
mr.
jack
l.
landau
well,
that
is
true,
but--
mr.
jack
l.
landau
--without
attempting
to
be
glib
in
the
slightest,
what
we
are
after
here
is
the
accurate
determination
of
the
facts.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
weighs
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
so
much
the
better.
to
the
extent
that
it
weighs
against
the
petitioner,
it
certainly
helps
the
balance
of
the
system,
which
would
otherwise
be
wasting
its
time.
and
that
was
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize,
was
that
is
also
works
in
the
favor
of
the
federal
courts
which
might
not
otherwise
have
to
hear
the
matter
at
all
if
the
full
record
were
put
before
the
state...
or
the
state
court
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
wax
also
mentions
the
legislative
history
and
says
in
that
in
the
'64
and
'66
act
legislative
history
there
is
some
aversion...
or
some
reference
to
townsend.
that
is
true,
but
if
you
look
at
that
legislative
history,
the
comments
are
twofold.
first,
that
there
was...
there's
concern
about
the
effect
of
townsend
being
too
many
additional
hearings.
and
second,
the
inappropriateness
from
a
federalism
point
of
having
the
federal
courts
reviewing
the
state
fact-finding
process.
as
the
court
has...
as
this
court
has
observed
in
sumner
v.
mata,
the
whole
underpinning
of
the
statute
is
to
reduce
the
friction
that
necessarily
follows
when
you
have
any
evidentiary
hearings
on...
in
federal
court
to
review
those
findings
of
the
state
court.
if
that
is
so,
it
makes
no
sense
to
argue
that
the
statute...
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
