justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mccleskey
was
a
state
prisoner.
he
was
a
state
prisoner
on
federal
habeas.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
we
made
it
very
clear
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
petitioner
to
the
extent
possible
to
bring
all
of
his
claims
in
the
first
proceeding.
but
doesn't
that
mean
that
that
first
proceeding
is
of
the
greatest
importance
and
so...
isn't
that
an
argument,
at
least,
for
saying
that
there
should
be
a
full
fact-finding
and
evidentiary
hearing
at
that
stage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
said
first
opportunity
and
my
submission
to
you
was
that
it
was
the
first
hearing
in
federal
court
where
the
statute,
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
for
disregarding
the
state's
finding
is
that
the
facts
were
not
adequately
developed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
wasn't
quite
sure
when
you
answered
justice
steven's
first
question
about
2254(d)(3).
i
thought
the
substance
of
your
answer
was
that
well,
the
hearing
doesn't
have
to
be
held.
of
course
the
proceeding
must
be
held
in
any...
you're
absolutely
entitled
to
bring
the
first
proceeding.
and
2254(d)
begins
that
way:
in
any
proceeding
instituted
in
federal
court.
and
then
it
says
that
the
state's
fact-finding
should
be
deemed
adequate
unless...
then
(d)(3),
the
material
facts
were
not
adequately
developed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
provided
it
finds
that
the
facts
were
adequately
developed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
2254(d)(3).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
the
gravamen
of
the
respondent's
argument,
that
the
facts
weren't
adequately
developed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there's
no
evidentiary
presumption
if
the
facts
were
not
adequately
developed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
the
federal
court
may
not
make
the
presumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
only
point
was
that
the
state...
that
the
district
court
on
the
first
federal
petition
has
not
option
but
to
accept
the
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
this
respect
it's
different
from
mccleskey
because
mccleskey
said
there
should
be
no
proceeding,
that
proceeding
itself
is
barred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
also
cast
doubt
on
the
adequacy
of
the
determination?
is
that
the
semantic
equivalent
to
what
you
just
said?
in
other
words,
you
said
it
cast
doubt
on
accuracy.
is
that
the
same
as
the
standard
required
in
2254(d)(3)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
talked
about
adequate
development,
not
the
accuracy
of
the
determination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
fact
does
remain
that,
of
course,
(d)
on
its
own
terms,
taken
with
or
without
conjunction
with
(b),
sets
forth
some
very
substantial
state
policies.
and
if
you
interpret
(3)
to
say
that
the
petitioner
has
in
effect
the
option
not
to
develop
the
facts
adequately
by
a
poorly
presented
state
case
gives
very
little
effect
to
the
whole
purpose
of
the
main
paragraph
in
(d),
which
is
to
respect
the
judgments
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
correct,
mr.
wax,
that
the
district
court
has
the
discretion
to
hold
a
hearing
if
it
chooses
to
do
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
under
the
deliberate
bypass
standard,
does
the
court
have
discretion
to
go
ahead
and
hold
a
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
circumstance
work
for
you
or
against
you
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
there
is
discretion
to
ignore
the
deliberate
bypass
rule,
if
that's
the
rule,
or
i
assume,
the
cause
and
prejudice
rule,
if
that's
the
rule
we
adopt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
it
work
for
you
to
the
extent
that
if
the
rule
is
valid,
it
indicates
that
the
statute
is
not
binding
on
the
district
court?
