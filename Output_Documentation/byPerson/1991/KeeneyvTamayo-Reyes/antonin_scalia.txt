but
that's
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
subsection
(3)
is
given
application,
under
your
theory,
when
a
case
is
accepted
by
the
federal
court
because
there
was
cause
and
prejudice.
and
then
having
accepted
it,
finding
that
as
to
a
particular
matter,
the
material
facts,
because
of
the
cause
and
prejudice,
were
not
adequately
developed.
as
to
that
item,
having
accepted
the
case,
the
court
will
not
give
any
deference
to
the
state
court
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
still
does
have
some
application.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
provision?
is
it
in
your
brief
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
set
it
forth?
i
know
you
mention
it.
do
you
set
it...
set
forth
the
text?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wax,
2254
also
includes
subsection
(b),
which
says
that
an
application
shall
not...
for
federal
habeas
shall
not
be
granted
unless
it
appears
that
the
applicant
has
exhausted
the
remedies
available
in
the
courts
of
the
state
or
that
there
is
either
an
absence
of
available
state
corrective
process
or
the
existence
of
circumstances
rendering
such
process
ineffective.
that's
rather
a
useless
provision
if
it
means
it
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
show
up
and
doesn't
have
to
make
his
available
argument
there,
but
can
do
a
shoddy
job
and
then
await
a
federal
proceeding
to
do
it.
don't
you
think
that
that
points
in
the
opposite
direction
from
what
you're
arguing
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
that's
an
unusual
application
of
exhaustion.
i
think
the
terminology
really
comes
from
administrative
law
that
you
had
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
before
you
came
into
federal
court.
and
it
was,
you
know,
unthinkable
that
any
fact
you
didn't
present
to
the
administrative
agency
you
could
then
present
to
the
federal
court
and
could
still
be
deemed
to
have
exhausted
your
original
remedy.
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
court
would
say
why
didn't
you
tell
this
to
the
administrative
agency.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
same
thing
here.
now,
if
there's
cause...
if
there's
cause
for
his
reason
not
to
present
it,
i
can
understand
it.
but
it
seems
a
strange
exhaustion
requirement
to
say
that
you
can
put
before
the
state
court
whatever
he
chooses
to
put,
but
it
doesn't
matter
because
he
can
make
a
whole
new
case
when
he
gets
before
the
federal
court.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
real
exhaustion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
mistaking
my
point.
i'm
not
saying
that
2254(b)
by
its
literal
application
prevents
what
you
tried
to
do
here.
i'm
just
saying
it
seems
to
me
rather
incompatible
with
a
mentality
that
puts
in
an
exhaustion
requirement
that
congress
would
allow
you
to
put
in
anything
new
that
you
want,
so
long
as
there
was
not
a
deliberate
bypass.
the
two
don't
readily
go
together.
