ms.
kathryn
kolbert
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whether
our
constitution
endows
government
with
the
power
to
force
a
woman
to
continue
or
to
end
a
pregnancy
against
her
will
is
the
central
question
in
this
case.
since
this
court's
decision
in
roe
v.
wade,
a
generation
of
american
women
have
come
of
age
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
constitution
provides
the
highest
level
of
protection
for
their
child-bearing
decisions.
this
landmark
decision,
which
necessarily
and
logically
flows
from
a
century
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
not
only
protects
rights
of
bodily
integrity
and
autonomy,
but
has
enabled
millions
of
women
to
participate
fully
and
equally
in
society.
the
genius
of
roe
and
the
constitution
is
that
it
fully
protects
rights
of
fundamental
importance.
government
may
not
chip
away
at
fundamental
rights,
nor
make
them
selectively
available
only
to
the
most
privileged
women.
if
the
right
to
choose
abortion
remains
fundamental
as
established
in
roe
v.
wade,
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
is
applicable,
and
as
this
court
found
in
akron
and
in
thornburgh,
pennsylvania's
onerous
restrictions
must
fall.
should
this
court
abandon
strict
scrutiny,
as
urged
by
the
commonwealth
and
the
solicitor,
not
only
might
pennsylvania's
egregious
intrusions
on
privacy
stand
and
a
century
of
this
court's
privacy
decisions
may
also
be
dismantled.
equally
disturbing,
should
this
court
remove
fundamental
protection
for
the
abortion
right,
women
might
again
be
forced
to
the
back
alleys
for
their
medical
care
with
grave
consequences
for
their
lives
and
health.
the
commonwealth
argues
that
this
court
may
overrule
akron
and
thornburgh
and
abandon
strict
scrutiny
and
nevertheless
preserve
roe's
central
meaning.
while
politically
expedient,
this
view
is
certainly
not
based
upon
this
court's
privacy
jurisprudence.
every
other
brief
filed
in
this
case
agrees
that
the
protection
offered
by
roe's
heightened
scrutiny
lies
at
the
core
of
this
important
decision.
to
abandon
heightened
review
is
to
overrule
roe.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
is
of
fundamental
importance
to
the
rule
of
law.
fidelity
to
precedent
ensures
that
our
law
will
develop
in
a
principled
and
intelligible
fashion,
and
that
our
guiding
rules
are
founded
in
law
rather
than
in
the
proclivities
of
individuals.
accordingly,
this
court
has
established
that
departure
from
precedent
must
be
supported
by
some
special
justification,
but
no
special
justification
exists
here.
only
9
years
ago
in
akron,
this
court
invoked
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
and
expressly
reaffirmed
roe
v.
wade.
only
3
years
later,
in
thornburgh,
a
case
that
is
virtually
identical
to
that
before
this
court
today,
this
court
again
found
especially
compelling
reasons
to
reaffirm
roe
and
to
find
pennsylvania
law
unconstitutional
under
the
standard
of
strict
scrutiny.
nothing
has
changed
since
that
time.
indeed,
millions
of
women
continue
to
rely
on
the
fundamental
rights
guaranteed
in
roe
v.
wade.
the
medical
conditions
that
led
this
court
to
create
and
establish
these
fundamental
rights
remain
the
same.
this
case,
the
statute,
the
parties,
are
nearly
identical
to
those
in
thornburgh.
never
before
has
this
court
bestowed
and
taken
back
a
fundamental
right
that
has
been
part
of
the
settled
rights
and
expectations
of
literally
millions
of
americans
for
nearly
two
decades.
to
regress
now
by
permitting
states
suddenly
to
impose
burdensome
regulations,
or
to
criminalize
conduct,
would
be
incompatible
with
any
notion
of
principled
constitutional
decision-making.
roe
is
both
soundly
based
in
the
constitution
and
sets
forth
a
fair
and
workable
standard
of
adjudication.
from
as
early
as
1891,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
rights
of
autonomy,
bodily
integrity,
and
equality
are
central
to
our
notions
of
ordered
liberty.
roe
lies
at
the
heart
of
those
interests.
while
pregnancy
may
be
a
blessed
act
when
planned
or
wanted,
forced
pregnancy,
like
any
forced
bodily
invasion,
is
anathema
to
american
values
and
traditions.
in
the
same
way
that
it
would
be
unacceptable
for
government
to
force
a
man
or
a
woman
to
donate
bone
marrow,
or
to
compel
the
contribution
of
a
kidney
to
another,
or
to
compel
women
to
undergo
abortion
or
forced
sterilization,
our
constitution
protects
women
against
forced
pregnancy.
if
anything,
because
forced
pregnancy
will
jeopardize
a
woman's
life
or
health,
the
constitutional
protections
ought
to
be
greater.
the
solicitor
tries
to
draw
a
distinction
between
constitutional
protection
against
forced
abortion,
which
he
agrees
is
fundamental,
and
constitutional
protection
against
forced
pregnancy,
which
he
maligns,
but
once
this
court
removes
fundamental
status
from
the
abortion
right,
there
is
no
logical
stopping
point.
fundamental
status
for
all
reproductive
rights,
decisions
about
birth
control,
pregnancy,
sterilization,
even
high
technology
around
reproduction,
may
also
be
jeopardized.
particularly
where
there
is
no
bright
line
between
abortion
and
some
methods
of
birth
control,
the
fundamental
right
both
to
prevent
pregnancy
and
to
end
pregnancy
may
be
at
stake.
our
nation's
history
and
tradition
also
respects
the
autonomy
of
individuals
to
make
life
choices
consistent
with
their
own
moral
and
conscientious
beliefs.
our
constitution
has
long
recognized
an
individual's
right
to
make
private
and
intimate
decisions
about
marriage
and
family
life,
the
upbringing
of
children,
the
ability
to
use
contraception.
the
decision
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
or
to
carry
it
to
term
is
no
different
in
kind.
both
the
solicitor
and
some
commonwealth
amici
argue
that
the
constitution
only
protects
private
decision-making
within
families.
it
is
true
that
the
rights
of
privacy
have
been
recognized
in
the
familial
context.
for
example,
in
griswold
the
court
found
unconstitutional
the
connecticut
statute
that
prohibited
married
persons
from
using
birth
control
and
in
loving
this
court
found
invalid
a
virginia
statute
that
prohibited
the
marriage
of
interracial
couples.
nevertheless,
this
court
has
never
limited
the
notions
of
privacy
recognized
in
these
cases
as
only
arising
or
belonging
to
married
couples.
indeed,
in
eisenstadt
and
in
carey
this
court
specifically
rejected
this
view.
nor
can
this
court
alter
its
historic
recognition
of
privacy
and
deny
women
fundamental
freedoms
because,
as
the
solicitor
argues,
the
woman
is
not
isolated
in
her
privacy.
surely
if
the
government
cannot
require
individuals
to
sacrifice
their
lives
or
health
for
others
or
for
other
compelling
purposes,
it
cannot
require
women
to
sacrifice
their
lives
and
health
to
further
the
state's
interest
in
potential
life.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
i
do.
however,
the
central
question
in
the
case
is
what
is
the
standard
that
this
court
uses
to
evaluate
the
restrictions
that
are
at
issue,
and
therefore
one
cannot--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--yes,
i
am,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
in
particular
to
address
the
husband
notification
provisions,
but
the
standard
that
this
court
applies
will
well
establish
the
outcome
in
this
case
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
this
court
has
already
found
that
under
the
principles
of
roe
v.
wade
the
bulk
of
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
question
that
this
court
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
under
strict
scrutiny
the
bias
counseling
provisions
and
the
24-hour
mandatory
delay
both
in
thornburgh
and
in
akron,
the
case
in
1983,
and
therefore
this
court
must
examine
first
the
question
of
what's
the
appropriate
standard
before
determining
the
constitutionality
of
those
other
provisions.
the
court
cannot
alter
its
historic
recognition
of
privacy
and
deny
women
fundamental
freedoms,
as
i
was
speaking,
because
as
the
solicitor
argues,
there
is
the
presence
of
the
fetus.
surely,
if
the
government
cannot
require
individuals
to
sacrifice
their
lives
or
health
for
human
beings
who
are
born
for
other
compelling
purposes,
they
cannot
do
so
for
purposes
of
protecting
potential
fetal
life.
and
if
this
court
is
to
reduce
the
presence
of
a
constitutional
right
merely
because
of
the
presence
of
the
fetus,
other
childbearing
decisions,
whether
they
be
the
right
to
carry
the
pregnancy
to
term
or
make
other
childbearing
decisions
will
be
particularly
affected.
particularly
here,
as
this
court
noted
in
roe
where
there
is
widespread
disagreement
in
both
a
philosophical
and
a
religious
sense
about
when
life
begins,
this
court
cannot
sanction
one
view
to
the
detriment
of
women's
lives
and
health;
nor
can
the
state
of
the
law
in
1868
define
or
determine
constitutional
rights
for
all
future
generations.
this
court
must
look
generally
to
whether
a
right
is
reflected
in
our
nation's
history
and
traditions
rather
than
at
whether
the
activity
was
illegal
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
relying
exclusively
on
what
50
states
have
legislated
in
determining
the
scope
of
liberty
would
imperil
numerous
freedoms
such
as
rights
recognized
by
this
court
in
brown,
bolling,
griswold
and
loving.
this
court
has
also
recognized
as--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
you
have
to
look
very
generally
at
whether
the
nation's
history
and
tradition
has
respected
interests
of
bodily
integrity
and
autonomy
and
whether
there
has
been
a
tradition
of
respect
for
equality
of
women.
those
are
the
central
and
core
values--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--well,
this
court
is...
if
the
court
was
only
to
look
at
whether
abortion
was
illegal
in
1868,
that
is
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
would
be
placed
in
a
very
difficult
situation
because
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
nation,
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
adopted,
abortion
was
legal.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
well,
we
think
that
the
court
ought
to
look
generally
at
the
principles
that
this
decision
protects.
that
while
it
is
important
to
look...
and
i
would
not
urge
you
to
ignore
the
state
of
the
law
at
different
periods
of
our
history,
it
is
only
one
factor
in
a
variety
of
factors
that
this
court
has
to
look
to
in
determining
whether
or
not
something
is
fundamental.
and
fundamental
status
in
this
instance
derives
from
a
history
of
this
court's
acknowledgement
and
acceptance
that
private,
autonomous
decisions
made
by
women
in
the
privacy
of
their
families
ought
to
be
respected
and
accorded
fundamental
status.
certainly,
the
anomalous
posture
of
the
fact
that
abortion
was
legal
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
constitution
and
then
illegal
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
place
this
court
in
a
very
difficult
position,
that
is,
rights
may
be
guaranteed
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
the
fourteenth,
merely
because
only
the
exact
state
of
the
law
in
1868
is
the
factor
that
the
court
accepts.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
i
would,
and
that
is
the
argument
that
this
court
has
made
in
many
instances
in
rejecting
exactly
the
state
of
the
law
prior
to
the
granting
of
fundamental
status.
that
is,
this
court,
if
we
were
only
to
look
at
whether
state
legislatures
prohibited
activity
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
activity
is
fundamental,
many
of
the
most
precious
rights
that
we
now
have:
rights
to
travel,
rights
to
vote,
rights
to
be
free
from
racial
segregation
would
not
be
accorded
status
because
in
fact,
state
legislators
have
acted
to
inhibit
those
rights
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
rights
at
issue
here,
that
is,
the
rights
of
privacy,
the
rights
of
autonomy
flow
from
the
liberty
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
also
mentioned
in
the
constitution.
the
debate
centers
on
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
term
liberty,
and
we
think
that
the
precedence
of
this
court
that
began
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
and
have
proceeded
from
this
court
to
the
very
present,
would
logically
and
necessarily
include
fundamental
rights
to
decide
whether
to
carry
a
pregnancy
to
term
or
to
terminate
that
pregnancy.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
the
critical
factor
is
whether,
as
a
result
of
its
fundamental
status,
this
court
will
accord
the
standard
of
roe,
that
is,
strict
scrutiny
because
under
that
standard
there
is
no
dispute
among
the
parties.
under
that
standard,
the
bias
counseling
provisions,
the
24
hour
mandatory
delay
have
been
found
unconstitutional,
and
significantly,
this
court
has
also
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
husband
consent
requirements,
very
similar
to
the
husband
notification
requirements
at
issue
in
this
case,
have
also
been
found
unconstitutional--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
if
this
court
were
to
change
the
standard
of
strict
scrutiny,
which
has
been
the
central
core
of
that
holding,
that
in
fact,
that
will
undercut
the
holdings
of
this
court
and
effectively
overrule
roe
v.
wade.
to
adopt
a
lesser
standard,
to
abandon
strict
scrutiny
for
a
less
protective
standard
such
as
the
undue
burden
test
or
the
rational
relationship
test,
which
has
been
discussed
by
this
court
on
many
occasions,
would
be
the
same
as
overruling
roe
for
it
is
the
beauty
of
roe,
the
protections
of
roe
flow
from
the
fact
that
this
court
gives,
upon
a
proof
that
particular
state
regulations
interfere
with
the
right.
roe
establishes
and
creates
a
burden
on
government
to
come
forward
with
a
compelling
purpose.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
our
position
is
that
roe,
in
establishing
a
trimester
framework,
in
establishing
strict
scrutiny,
and
in
also
establishing
that
the
rights
of
women
and
the
health
interests
of
women
always
take
precedent
over
the
state's
interest
in
potential
life.
those
hallmarks
of
roe
are
central
to
this
case,
and
are
central
to
continuing
recognition
of
the
right
as
fundamental.
should
the
court
abandon
that--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--what
the
court--
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
--your
honor,
under
roe,
after
the
point
of
viability,
that
is
the
point
when
the
fetus
is
capable
of
survival,
the
state
is
free
to
prohibit
abortion
but
only
so
long
as
it
is
necessary,
only
so
long
as
the
woman's
health
interests
and
life
interests
are
not
at
stake.
that
is,
potential
fetal
life
is
a
recognized
value,
is
a
recognized
state
interest
after
the
point
of
viability;
but
when
in
conflict,
when
the
woman's
health
interest
is
in
conflict
with
those
state
interests
and
potential
life,
those
women's
interest,
the
women's
interest
in
health
take
precedent.
now
admittedly,
the
question
of
viability
and
the
viability
line
is
not
as
present
in
this
case
as
it
has
been
in
many
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
seen
before
here.
that
is,
all
of
the
restrictions
that
are
issue
in
pennsylvania
attach
in
pregnancy
at
the
very
beginning
of
pregnancy,
and
therefore,
the
state's
interest
in
protection
of
fetal
life
really
does
not
come
into
play.
the
real
issue
is
whether
or
not
these
health
interests,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
a
compelling
interest
in
health
are
present.
and
frankly,
this
court
need
only
look
to
the
record,
that
is,
need
only
look
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court
to
determine
that
this
statute
in
no
way
furthers
women's
health
interests.
that
in
fact,
what
this
statute
does
is
cause
a
detriment
to
women's
health,
submit
her
to
increased
dangers
as
a
result
of
delay,
as
a
result
of
interference
with
the
doctor/patient
relationship,
as
a
result
of
permitting
third
parties
who
would
injure
individuals
who
are
required
to
give
husband
notification,
that
those
interests
in
health
are
not
furthered
in
any
respect.
the
commonwealth
attempts
to
characterize
the
restrictions
at
issue
here
as
reasonable.
for
the
woman
who
as
a
result
of
mandatory
husband
notification
provisions
will
be
beaten,
or
will
see
her
children
beaten,
the
restrictions
are
not
reasonable.
for
the
woman
who
must
travel
200
miles
on
two
and
three
occasions
as
a
result
of
the
act's
mandatory
delay,
the
restrictions
are
not
reasonable.
for
the
woman
who
has
become
pregnant
as
a
result
of
marital
rape,
obtaining
information
from
her
doctor
that
her
husband
may
be
liable
for
child
support
is
both
cruel
and
oppressive.
they
are
not
reasonable.
to
find
these
restrictions
reasonable,
this
court
would
have
to
ignore
the
facts
placed
in
evidence
in
this
case
which
demonstrate
that
the
restrictions
were
not
enacted
to
improve
women's
decision
making
or
health
care.
after
listening
to
the
testimony
of
ten
witnesses,
including
those
proffered
by
the
commonwealth,
the
district
court
made
387
findings
of
fact
and
repeatedly
concluded
that
the
pennsylvania
restrictions
will
interfere
with
the
ability
of
physicians
to
provide
quality
medical
care
and
will
delay
and
discourage
the
performance
of
abortion
to
further
no
legitimate
state
interest.
in
particular,
the
lower
court
found
that
the
mandatory
husband
notification
provisions
will
have
dangerous
and
potentially
deadly
consequences
for
battered
women,
likening
force
notification
in
a
battering
situation
to
providing
the
husband
with
a
hammer
with
which
to
beat
his
wife.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
it
was,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
that's
right.
the
district
court
found,
as
well,
that
bias
counseling
provisions
transform
the
physician
from
the
impartial
counselor
mandated
by
accepted
medical
standards
into
a
partisan
proponent
of
the
state's
ideology.
and
mandatory
delay
will
increase
both
the
expense
and
medical
dangers
of
abortion,
yet
furthering
no
legitimate
state
purpose.
there
is
no
serious
contest
about
the
effect
of
this
law.
nor
can
there
be,
for
under
rule
52
the
district
court's
findings
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
nor
did
the
fact
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge
require
petitioners
to
prove
that
the
statute
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied
to
any
person.
this
court
had
repeatedly
found
statutes
facially
invalid
after
looking
at
facts
like
those
present
here.
for
example
in
hodgson,
this
court
relied
extensively
on
district
court
findings
to
strike
down
minnesota's
two
parent
notification
statute
with
no
bypass,
despite
the
fact
that
that
statute
had
never
yet
been
in
effect.
the
extensive
record
here
demonstrates
that
the
harms
are
not
speculative
nor
remote,
nor
is
this
a
worst
case
scenario.
the
court
should
not
demand
an
unwanted
child
or
a
woman
maimed
by
an
illegal
abortion
as
proof
that
strict
scrutiny
is
applicable.
pennsylvania
women
should
not
be
the
guinea
pigs
in
the
state's
experiment
with
constitutional
law.
to
find
otherwise
would
totally
eviscerate
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review,
and
would
prevent
federal
courts
from
scrutinizing
legislative
findings,
a
central
role
in
the
process
of
judicial
review.
let
me
turn
now
to...
specifically
to
the
husband
notification
provision.
there
is
little
doubt
that
these
provisions
violate
the
fundamental
right
of
privacy,
marital
integrity
and
equality.
beginning
as
early
as
danforth,
this
court
recognized
that
a
husband
cannot
arbitrarily
veto
the
childbearing
decisions
of
his
wife.
like
the
missouri
law
at
issue
in
danforth,
state
mandated
communication
between
husbands
and
wives
violates
the
autonomy
of
married
women
to
make
personal
and
private
decisions,
particularly
here
where
a
married
woman
is
often
the
survivor
of
martial
rape
and
where
the
penalty
for
transgressing
her
husband
is
likely
to
be
physical
violence
against
her
or
her
family
members.
government
has
the
obligation
to
respect
her
private
decisions,
not
to
involve
her
husband.
the
solicitor
dismisses
the
import
of
the
state-imposed
harm
and
believes
or
claims
that
the
constitution
is
not
intended
to
remedy
them.
but
this
approach
seriously
ignores
that
women
will
be
seriously
maimed
and
that
harms
will
be
invoked,
and
it
is
a
callous
disregard
for
their
lives
and
health.
while
it
may
be
desireable
for
husbands
and
wives
to
share
intimacies
in
their
daily
life,
the
concepts
of
this
court
developed
in
the
principles
of
marital
integrity
ensure
that
the
government
cannot
decree
for
those
couples
how
that
communication
should
occur.
to
decree
and
direct
family
life
is
more
destructive
of
family
integrity
than
permitting
families
to
resolve
their
differences
on
their
own
terms.
the
husband
notification
provisions
also
violate
principles
of
equality.
these
are
provisions
that
apply
to
women
and
women
alone.
imposed
notification
is...
gives
a
benefit
only
to
men,
and
as
such
they
violate
the
dictates
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
legislative
scheme
that
assumes
that
husbands
are
capable
and
authorized
to
make
all
independent
decisions
but
wives
are
not,
reflect
an
outmoded
common
law
view
that
women,
once
married,
lost
their
legal
identities
to
their
husbands.
in
the
days
before
roe,
thousands
of
women
lost
their
lives
and
more
were
subjected
to
physical
and
emotional
scars
from
back
alley
and
self-induced
abortions.
recognizing
that,
this
court
established
roe
and
established
fundamental
protection
for
women's
childbearing
decisions.
we
urge
this
court
to
reaffirm
those
principles
today,
to
adopt
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
akron
and
thornburgh
that
used
the
roe
strict
scrutiny
standard,
and
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
reserve
3
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
there's
no
further
questions
from
the
court.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
address
two
points
very
quickly.
the
first
is
in
response
to
this
last
dialogue
with
general
starr.
recognition
of
a
state's
interest
in
fetal
life
as
compelling
throughout
pregnancy
would
denigrate
and
restrict
the
ability
of
women
at
all
stages
of
pregnancy
to
have
an
abortion.
and
certainly
in
the
only
exception
that
the
mr.
starr
and
the
solicitor
general
has
laid
out
for
this
court,
is
in
the
very
rare
instance
where
only
the
life
of
the
woman
would
be
excluded
from
a
ban.
bans
of
second
trimester
abortions,
bans
of
certain
classes
of
women
having
abortions,
bans
that
would
prevent
women
who
have
serious
and
long
lasting
health
needs
to
have
abortions,
would
be
significantly
approved
by
this
court
if
the
rational
basis
standard
were
adopted,
precisely
because
of
a
formulation
that
the
state's
interest
is
compelling
throughout
pregnancy
and
sufficient
to
override
any
liberty
interests,
any
interests
of
the
woman
to
choose
or
not
choose
a
pregnancy.
and,
in
fact,
that
is
why
this
court
must
go
back
to
the
hallmark
of
roe.
that
is
again
reaffirm
that
the
right
to
choose
abortion
is
fundamental.
and
only
when
the
government
can
show
a
compelling
purpose...
as
recognized
in
roe
that
is,
a
compelling
purpose
after
the
point
of
viability...
should
it
be
able
to
sustain
a
statute.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
raise
goes
to
the
question
of
the
rights
by
numbers
approach
articulated
by
the
commonwealth.
it
is
our
view
that
the
husband
notification
statute
applies
to
every
single
married
woman
in
pennsylvania.
that
the
rights
of
autonomy,
the
rights
of
communication
within
the
family,
are
infringed
because
those
communications
are
subject
to
criminal
prosecution,
and
subject
to
independent
district
attorneys
subpoenaing
women
and
probing
the
communications
between
husband
and
wife.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
your
honor,
i
do
believe
there
are,
not
only
in
this
section,
but
in
the
bias
counseling
provisions
as
well.
clearly,
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
why
we
believe
this
is
not
commercial
speech.
but
in
both
instances,
the
court
is
forcing
the
physician
to
be
the
proponent
of
its
ideology,
and
also
to
communicate
information
about
the
abortion
decision.
ms.
kathryn
kolbert
thank
you.
