anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
question
the
importance
of
your
arguing
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right,
as
you
have
done;
however,
there
is
a
fundamental
right
to
speech
and
we
hear
any
number
of
arguments
in
this
case
on
time,
place
and
manner.
i
don't
think
our
decision
on
parental
notice
in
the
akron
case
is
necessarily
inconsistent
with
a
fundamental
right.
but
one
way
of
our
understanding
this
fundamental
rights
and
their
parameters,
their
dimensions
is
to
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
you
have
a
number
of
specific
provisions
here
that
i
think
you
should
address.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
suggesting
that
our
sustaining
these
statutory
provisions
does
not
necessarily
undercut
all
of
the
holding
of
roe
v.
wade.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
are
going
to
argue
that
roe
can
survive
only
in
its
most
rigid
formulation,
that
is
an
election
you
can
make
as
counsel.
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
that
is
not
the
only
logical
possibility
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
if
the
statute
has
no
effect.
as
a
general
matter,
when
we're
dealing
with
rational
basis
review,
we
ask
whom
does
the
law
affect,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
justify
the
law
based
on
the
effect
of
this
1
percent
who
would
not
otherwise...
and
you
may
have
an
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
very
strange
argument
to
say
that
the
law
doesn't
affect
90
percent
of
the
people
so
we're
not
concerned
with
the
law.
i've
never
heard
that
argument.
