ms.
kolbert,
on
this
last
point,
i
am
not
sure
what
you
suggest
we
look
to.
you
say
we
should
not
look
to
what
the
practice
was
in
1868.
should
we
look
to
what
the
practice
was
at
the
time
of
roe
or
what
the
practice
is
today?
that
is,
what
the
states
would
do,
left
to
their
own
devices?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
to
abortion
in
particular?
justice
antonin
scalia
pick
1968,
i
gather
you
wouldn't
accept
1968
either
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
an
antiquarian
argument
you
are
making.
you
would
have
made
the
same
argument
in
1868.
i
think
you
would
have
said
the
mere
fact
that
most
states
disfavor
abortion
is
no
justification
for
this
court's
saying
that
it
is
not
therefore
included
within
it.
you
would
have
made
that
same
argument
in
1868.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
those
are
mentioned
in
the
constitution
like
racial
segregation.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
preate,
i
thought
we
were
talking,
not
rational
basis
but
undue
burden.
are
they
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
i
go
about
determining
whether
it's
an
undue
burden
or
not?
what
law
books
do
i
look
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
depends
on
how
important
i
would
think
it
is,
that
a
husband
of
a
wife
know
before
a
fetus
that
he
co-generated
be
destroyed.
would
that
be
part
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends.
i
mean,
if
the
impact
is
only
minimal,
but
also
the
interest
involved
is
only
minimal,
then
i
suppose
it
is
an
undue
burden,
and
i
guess
that
again
leads
you
to
how
much
weight
you
place
on
that
kind
of
an
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
the
facial
context,
i
don't
understand
what
you...
so
there
are
two
undue
burden
tests.
there
is
one
at
the
facial
level
in
which
we
consider
the
statute
engross
and
decide
whether,
all
things
considered
in
the
generality
of
applications,
the
burden
is
undue.
and
then
we
have
a
second
wave
of
application
of
the
undue
burden
test
case-by-case,
so
that
even
though
the
law
facially
may
be
okay,
it
may
be
invalid
in
its
particular
application
because
of...
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
worried
about
the
first
one,
not
the
second
one.
i
thought
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
single
case,
not
engross,
to
any
single
case.
isn't
that
the
normal
situation?
to
challenge
a
statute
facially
you
have
to
show
that
it
can
never
be
constitutionally
applied,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
looking
at
it
engross.
that
is
asking
whether
there
is
any
single
case
where
a
woman
would
not
be
unduly
burdened.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
did
not
say
in
roe
that
a
state
could
not
have
a
position
on
whether
a
fetus
is
a
person,
did
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
said
that
the
constitution
takes
no
position
on
whether
a
fetus
is
a
person,
and/or
that
it
does
take
a
position
that
a
fetus
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
state
regulation
on
the
basis
of
the
people's
determination
within
that
state
that
a
fetus
is
a
person.
there's
nothing
in
roe
that
says
a
state
may
not
make
that
judgment,
if
it
wishes.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
starr.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
there
have
to
be
something
in
the
constitution?
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
requires
the
state
to
protect
the
environment,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
that
can
be
a
compelling
state
interest,
may
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
that
roe
says
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
protect
the
fetus
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
does
not
say
that
a
state
may
not
choose
to
do
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
that
if
a
state
chooses
to
do
so,
it
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest.
there's
nothing
in
roe
that
contradicts
that.
