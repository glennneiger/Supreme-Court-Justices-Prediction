justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
kolbert,
you're
arguing
the
case
as
though
all
we
have
before
us
is
whether
to
apply
stare
decisis
and
preserve
roe
v.
wade
in
all
its
aspects.
nevertheless,
we
granted
certiorari
on
some
specific
questions
in
this
case.
do
you
plan
to
address
any
of
those
in
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
standard
may
affect
the
outcome
or
it
may
not,
but
at
bottom
we
still
have
to
deal
with
specific
issues,
and
i
wondered
if
you
were
going
to
address
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
did
the
court
hold
that,
even
after
viability
of
the
fetus
in
roe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
was
a
correct
characterization
of
roe's
holding
that
you
just
gave,
that
the
woman's
interest
always
takes
precedence?
is
that
true
under
roe,
in
the
latter
stages
of
pregnancy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
provision
does
not
require
notification
to
a
father
who
is
not
the
husband,
i
take
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
notice
if
the
woman
is
unmarried.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what's
the
interest,
to
try
to
preserve
the
marriage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
why
not
require
notice
to
all
fathers?
it's
a
curious
sort
of
a
provision,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
that
the
state
could
similarly
require
a
woman
to
notify
anyone
with
whom
she
had
intercourse
that
she
planned
to
use
some
means
of
birth
control
after
the
intercourse
that
operates,
let's
say,
as
an
abortifacient?
could
the
state
do
that?
i
mean,
it
would
be
the
same
state
interest,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
would
it
be
problematic,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
talking
about
the
provision
for
notification
in
this
case
under
the
statute
to
the
husband,
and
i'm
just
asking
whether
a
different
type
of
state
regulation
would
have
to
be
upheld
under
your
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
our
standard
on
a
facial
challenge,
whether
there's
a
substantial
likelihood
of
the
harm?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
as
applied
to
a
specific
woman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
let's
suppose
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
would
apply
an
undue
burden
test
there
on
the
as-applied
challenge,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
you
would
look
at
the
burden
of
the
law
as
applied
to
the
woman.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
compelling
speech
requires
any
kind
of
first
amendment
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
speech.
the
state
is
compelling
a
woman
to
say
something
to
her
husband.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
invoke
any
first
amendment
concerns?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
perhaps
compelling
speech
would
get
us
right
into
a
first
amendment
area.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
other
words,
the
doctor
is
to
say
certain
things
to
the
patient,
do
you
think
that
is
really
commercial
speech
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
that?
when
the
doctor
is
giving
professional
advice
to
the
patient,
you
think
that
is
commercial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
was
commercial
speech.
what
do
you
rely
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
is
advertising,
that
is
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
might
meet
a
first
amendment
test,
but
i
am
wondering
how
you
get
to
commercial
speech
on
that
kind
of
advice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
decided
that
in
roe,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
said
the
fetus
is
not
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
first
amendment
values
at
stake
there,
do
you
think?
