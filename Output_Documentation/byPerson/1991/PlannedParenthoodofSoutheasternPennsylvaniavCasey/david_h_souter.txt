justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
preate,
because
you
have
a
little
time
left,
there
is
one
point
on
which
i
guess
i
never
fully
followed
your
argument,
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
go
back
to
it.
you
got
to
the
point,
you
were
arguing
about
the
number
of
instances,
the
percentage
of
instances
in
which
the
spousal
notification
would
in
fact
make
a
difference
in
the
behavior
of
the
parties
involved.
and
as
i
recall,
you
got
it
down
to
about
5
percent
to
begin
with
who
would
not
otherwise,
5
percent
of
the
women
who
would
not
otherwise
give
notice
to
their
spouses.
then
from
that
5
percent
you
subtracted
some
number
for
those,
i
guess
subject
to
medical
emergencies,
those
subject
to
the
certification
that
they
would
be
physically
abused,
and
i
think
by
that
process
of
elimination
you
got
it
down
to
about
1
percent
who
would
actually
be
affected
by
the
stricture
of
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
talking
about
all
women,
but
the
spousal
notification
applies
only
to
married
women.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
percentage
of
married
women?
well,
your
time
is
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
also
not
the
position
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
that
it
is
a
compelling
interest
throughout
pregnancy?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
would
complete
prohibition,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
subject,
subject
to
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--subject
to
that
exception,
it
would
cover
complete
pro...
it
would
justify
complete
prohibition.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
i'll
grant
you
that,
but
you're
asking
the
court
to
adopt
a
standard
and
i
think
we
ought
to
know
where
the
standard
would
take
us.
