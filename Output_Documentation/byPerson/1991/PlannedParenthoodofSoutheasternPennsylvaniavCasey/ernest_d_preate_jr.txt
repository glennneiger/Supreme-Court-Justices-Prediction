mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
five
sections
of
our
pennsylvania
abortion
control
act
are
constitutional.
it
is
the
position
of
pennsylvania
that
each
of
the
five
provisions
is
constitutional
under
the
analysis
that
was
applied
by
this
court
in
webster;
that,
further,
roe
v.
wade
need
not
be
revisited
by
this
court
except
to
reaffirm
that
roe
did
not
establish
an
absolute
right
to
abortion
on
demand,
but
rather
a
limited
right
subject
to
reasonable
state
regulations
designed
to
serve
important
and
legitimate
state--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
yes,
i
have.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
in
our
view
the
accommodations
of
the
woman's
right
and
the
state's
legitimate
interest
in
the
unborn
child
is
best
served,
short
of
overruling
roe,
by
employing
the
undue
burden
standard
for
reviewing
state
abortion
regulations.
however,
as
we
argue
in
part
2
of
our
brief,
if
our
statute
cannot
be
upheld
under
the
undue
burden
standard,
roe,
being
wrongly
decided,
should
be
overruled.
i
will
now
address
the
specific
provisions
of
our
statute
and
start
with
the
requirement
of
spousal
notice,
which
was
the
only
aspect
of
our
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
unconstitutional.
it's
important
to
remember,
and
perhaps
more
important
in
this
context
than
any
other,
that
the
petitioners
brought
this
action
as
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
in
this
kind
of
a
challenge
it's
enough
for
the
petitioners
to
show...
it's
not
enough
for
them
to
show
that
the
act
might
be
unconstitutional-as
applied
to
someone
in
some
hypothetical,
worst-case
scenario.
rather,
the
petitioners
must
show
that
the
statute
could
not
constitutionally
be
applied
to
anyone.
we
asked,
have
they
met
that
burden,
and
we
submit
that
they
have
not
met
that
burden.
this
is
a
spousal
notice
provision,
it
is
not
a
spousal
consent
statute.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that's
correct
justice
o'connor.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it
only
applies
to
married
women.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
there
are
several
interests.
the
interest,
of
course,
in
protecting
the
life
of
the
unborn
child.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it
is
that,
but
the
legislature
has
made
the
judgment
that
it
wanted
its
statute
to
apply
in
this
specific
instance
because
it
wanted
to
further
the
integrity
of
marriages.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
the
state
interest
would
be
the
same,
but
i
think
that
would
be
problematic.
i'm
not--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--i
think
that
with
regard
to
applying
a
statute
to
all
women,
that
it
might
create
severe
obstacle,
an
absolute
obstacle
to
their
obtaining
an
abortion.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
the
undue
burden
standard,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
whether
or
not
the
regulation
would
impose
such
an
absolute
obstacle,
not
whether
it
would
deter
or
inhibit
some
women
from
obtaining
an
abortion.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
well,
if
the
state
had
posited
its
interest
as
protecting
the
life
of
the
unborn
then
utilizing
the
rational
basis
standard,
then
i
would
submit
that
it
could
legitimately
require
that
kind
of
notification
to
all
people.
in
this
instance,
however,
we
have
a
different
statute.
we
have
a
statute
that
provides
exceptions
where
exceptions
are
appropriate,
and
there
are
five
of
them:
medical
emergency,
where
the
husband
is
not
the
father
of
the
child,
where
the
husband
cannot
be
found,
where
the
pregnancy
is
the
result
of
a
reported
sexual
assault,
or
where
the
woman
in
her
judgment
believes
it's
likely
that
she
will
be
physically
abused.
now,
petitioners
have
produced
some
testimony
and
made
some
argument,
essentially
through
one
expert,
about
battered
wives,
but
the
testimony
was
that
some
unknown
number
were
rendered
so
helpless
by
their
battering
husbands
that
they
were
incapable
of
checking
off
a
line
on
the
form,
the
spousal
notice
form.
we
can
agree
that
these
women
are
indeed
cruelly
burdened,
but
they're
not
burdened
by
the
statute,
and
that's
the
compelling
point.
they're
not
burdened
by
the
statute,
but
by
the
circumstance,
and
the
tragic
circumstance,
of
their
lives.
we're
looking
at
the
statute
to
see
if
the
statute
imposes
the
obstacle.
if
there
is
a
battering
husband
that's
interposed
in
there,
that's
a
different
story.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
no,
i
think
you
have
to
ignore
what
the
petitioners
have
posited,
which
is
a
worst-case
analysis
scenario,
and
you
have
to
look
and
see
if
it
could
be
constitutionally
applied
and
value-tied
to
anyone,
and
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
instance
the
record
reflects
that
right
now,
in
pennsylvania,
50,000
abortions,
20
percent
of
those
women
are
married
and
95
percent
of
those
women
notify
their
husbands.
therefore,
only
1
percent
of
the
women
are
not,
in
pennsylvania,
notifying
their
husbands
now,
and
the
act's
not
even
in
effect.
there
is
no
broad
practical
effect
in
the
pennsylvania
statute
to
prohibiting
abortion
for
those
women.
if
the
act
goes
into
effect,
some
of
those
1
percent
of
women
will
then
have
to
notify
their
husband,
and
the
result
will
be
they
will
resolve
their
difficulties
amicably.
there
will
be
some
who
will
then
take
the
exception,
because
they
don't
want
to
notify
their
husband.
they
may
be
battered,
there
may
be
a
spousal
rape,
there
may
be...
they
can't
find
their
husband.
so
what
we're
doing
is
reducing
that
set
of
women
down
to
several
subsets
and
the
petitioners'
burden
in
a
facial
challenge
is
to
establish,
you
see,
that
there's
a
broad
practical
impact.
they
have
not
met
that
burden.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
got
all
of
that
question,
justice
stevens.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
in
that
1
percent,
not
everyone
would
want
to
notify,
and
there
are
exceptions.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
they
would
not
without
the
statute,
but
there
are
exceptions,
several
of
them...
four.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
justice--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--well,
that's
the
point.
on
this
record,
which
is
what
we
have
to
go
on,
there
is
nothing
established
by
the
petitioners
as
to
how
many
there
are
in
that
category.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
the
state
interest
in
upholding
the
statute
is
the
protection
of
the
life
of
the
unborn
and
the
protection
of
the
marital
integrity,
and
to
ensuring
of
communication,
the
possibility...
we
not
asking--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--and...
and--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--we're
not
in
any
way
advocating
that,
because
we
think
that
the
law
is
rational.
if
you
look
at
the
state
interests
that
are
trying
to
be
pursued
here...
protecting
the
life
of
the
unborn,
protecting
the
marriage,
ensuring
the
possibility
of
communication...
this
statute
rationally
advances
it.
it
may
not
advance
it
in
every
single
instance,
but
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is,
does
it
generally
rationally
advance
the
interest
that
the
state
is
trying
to
protect?
in
this
instance,
it
does.
but
by
the
sheer
numbers
that
we
have
demonstrated--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--no,
they
are
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
this
is
a
quantitative
analysis,
justice
scalia.
you
begin
by
ascertaining
under
undue
burden
the...
whether
it
is
a
significant
increase
in
cost
such
that
it
broaden
the
impacts,
prohibits
women
from
having
abortion
or
whether
it
bans
abortion.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that
would
be
part
of
the
analysis
that
is
done
on
the
weighing
side,
after
you
establish
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact...
in
the
first
instance,
the
threshold
question
is
what
is
the
broad
practical
impact?
if
there
is
no
broad
practical
impact,
it's
minimal,
as
is
in
pennsylvania
statute,
then
you
reach
the
question
of
the
weighing
that's
involved.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
justice
scalia,
what
you
are
talking
about
is
if
there
is
no
undue
burden,
that
is,
there
is
no
broad
practical
impact
in
the
initial
analysis,
then
you
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
rationally
furthers
the
state's
interest.
it's
a
rational
basis
test
in
the
second
phase
of
it.
and
under
the
rational
basis
test,
which
would
be
the
same
rational
basis
test
that
some
members
of
this
court
have
applied
in
webster,
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
pennsylvania's
spousal
notice
section
does
pass
undue
burden
analysis,
and
it
does
pass
rational
basis
analysis.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
i
think
justice
stevens,
in
the
initial
application,
it's
a
quantitative
analysis,
whether
there
is
a
broad
practical
impact
here.
the
fact
that
it
might--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--the
number
of
persons
affected--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--as
the
test
has
been
posited,
the
question
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--it
may
be
that
some
women
would
be
deterred
to
some
degree,
but
that
is
not
sufficient
to
create
an
undue
burden.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
initially,
it
is
the
number
of
women
affected,
the
broad
practical
impact
of
it--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--as
applied
to
a
specific
woman?
let's
say
there
is
such
a
woman
who
has
been
battered,
psychologically
battered,
and
so
the
exception
doesn't
work
in
her
instance.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
let's
posit
that.
in
that
instance,
of
course,
that
is
a
worst
case
scenario,
that
is
not
the
way
you
test
facial
challenges,
in
that
instance,
the
law
would
work.
you
would
test
this
statute
as
applied
in
the
lower
courts,
and
that
woman
would
then
be--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--no,
i
would
think
that--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--no.
i
would
think
that
you
would
be
asking
the
court
to
give
full
reign
to
the
interests
that
you
have.
the
woman
would
have,
under
rational
basis
analysis
test,
a
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
under
the
undue
burden
standard,
would
have
a
limited
right--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--and
i
think
that
you
would
look
to
that,
but
you
are
asking
the
court,
in
an
as-applied
mechanism
to
give
full
effect
to
your
right,
the
statute
given.
it
is
a
given
that
it
burdens
you.
so
you
can't
just
look
at
the
burden
in
the
as-applied
context,
but
you
must
look
at
it
in
that
context,
giving
full
reign
to
your
right,
and
that
is
what
the
woman
would
be
seeking
from
the
district
court
or
for
a
court
of
common
pleas,
in
asking
the
court,
in
applying
this
spousal
notice
section
to
her
particular
instance
because
she
didn't
have
one
of
the
exceptions
to
check
off
because
she
is
psychologically
or
economically
pressured.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
in
the
second
instance,
as
applied
it--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--in
a
facial
challenge,
justice
scalia,
you
are
looking
at
not
the
worst
scenario
hypothesis,
but
whether
this
act
could
be
applied
constitutionally
to
anyone,
and
that
is--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
find
that
there
is
no
undue
burden
in
our
statute,
anywhere
in
our
statute,
and
if
the
undue
burden
test
is,
as
applied
or
understood
by
this
court
causes
our
statute
to
fall,
then
we
ask
this
court
to
adopt
rational
basis
as
the
appropriate
analysis.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
compelling--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--we
are
asking
that
she--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--not
in
our
view,
this
statute--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--in
this
particular
instance,
this
statute,
we
feel
causes
notification,
but
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
involved
in
furthering
that
interest.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that
is
commercial.
the
petitioners
already
do
that
right
now.
they
already
tell
their
patients,
the
physicians
and
the
counselors
that
there
are
medical
risks
associated
with
this
procedure.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
in
zauderer.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
in
pennsylvania's
general
informed
consent
law,
applying
to
every
single
contact
between
the
doctor
and
a
patient,
there
is
the
same
information
that
must
be
presented
and
that
is,
the
doctor
must
tell
the
patient
about
the
medical
risks
of
the
procedure
and
the
alternatives
to
it.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
we
think
that
with
the...
with
the
interests
involved,
the
statute
furthers
those
interests
and
that
it
can
legitimately
require
the
husband
to
be
notified
because
of
the
interests
involved.
i
see
that
my
time
is
running
short,
and
i
wanted
to
make
sure
the
solicitor
general
has
some
time
to
respond.
we
think
that
pennsylvania
has
developed
an
intelligent
statute
that
fully
comports
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
a
statute
that
is
carefully
drafted
and
it
has
been
amended
to
reflect
the
teachings
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
since
roe.
we
ask
this
court
to
overturn
akron
and
thornburgh's
strict
scrutiny
approach
as
being
unwarranted
extensions
of
roe.
on
the
facial
challenge,
whereby
the
petitioners
must
show
that
there
are
no
set
of
circumstances
under
which
these
provisions
can
be
valid,
the
petitioners
have
utterly
failed
to
do
so,
done
in
by
no
small
measure
by,
as
the
record
demonstrates
and
as
indicated
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
but
their
own
rational
practices
which
this
statute
mirrors.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that
is
not
correct,
justice...
you
start
with
the
1
percent
because
95
percent
of
20
percent
is
1
percent.
you
are
talking
about
500
women
that--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
sorry.
thank
you.
