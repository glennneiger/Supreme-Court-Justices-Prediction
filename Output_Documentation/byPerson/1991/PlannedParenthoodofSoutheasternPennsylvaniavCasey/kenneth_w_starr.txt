mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
what
has
been
discussed,
let
me
address
very
briefly
three
points.
the
first
is
the
standard
of
review
which
has
been
the
subject
of
considerable
discussion.
in
a
number
of
its
cases
over
the
last
20
years
in
the
abortion
area,
the
court
has
articulated
the
governing
standard
of
review
in
different
ways.
and
as
a
result,
there
is
confusion
in
the
law
as
to
how
legislatures,
if
they
choose,
can
legislate,
and
how
judges
are
to
judge
in
this
extraordinarily
sensitive
and
divisive
area.
in
our
view,
the
correct
articulation
of
that
standard
is
to
be
found
in
the
webster
plurality
opinion.
that
standard
has
deep
roots.
it
finds
its
roots
in
a
long
line
of
due
process
cases
that
do
not
involve
liberty
interests
which,
by
virtue
of
the
nation's
history
and
its
legal
traditions,
rise
to
the
level
of
fundamental
rights
to
a
free
people.
this
is
the
process
of
analysis
that
is
quite
familiar
to
the
court,
very
lengthily
laid
out
by
justice
harlan
in
his
dissent
in
poe
versus
ullman,
and
then
adumbrated
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
griswold
against
connecticut.
second,
and
relatedly,
with
all
respect,
we
do
not
believe
that
stare
decisis
considerations
weigh
against
the
court
providing
that
needed
clarification
as
to
the
standard.
this
not
an
issue--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--certainly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
do
not
have
a
position
on
that
question
and
this
court
has
not
addressed,
or
at
least
there
is
no
justice
at
this
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that,
that,
that
is
correct.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
ultimately
that
is
an
extraordinarily
difficult
question
which
this
court
need
not
address,
and
it
need
not
address
it
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
do
not
have
a
position.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
do
not,
because
we
think
it
would
be
an
extraordinarily
difficult
and
sensitive
issue
by
virtue
of
a
number
of
questions
that
would
flow
from
that,
including
equal
protections
and
so
forth.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
court
did,
in
fact,
decide
that
there
is
a
very
keen
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state
in
what
the
roe
court
called
potential
life,
and
that's
my--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well
i
think
that
that
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
roe
v.
wade.
but
i
think
that
the
key
point
is
that
a
number
of
the
justices
of
this
court
have
said
that
regardless
of
that
legal
question,
that
constitutional
question,
that
the
state
does
have
a
compelling
interest
in
the
potential
life,
in
fetal
life,
and
that
that
interest
runs
throughout
pregnancy.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
certainly
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
court
seemed
to
admit
of
the
possibility
of
state
regulation
to
protect
the
unborn
at
all
stages.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
it
says,
that
the
state
may,
if
it
sees
fit,
that
the
state
does
have...
i
think
roe
goes
this
far.
roe
says
that
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
in
the
potential
life
in
utero
throughout
pregnancy,
and
then
the
nature
of
that
interest
changes
and
becomes
stronger
over
time.
but
it
did,
in
fact,
say
that
there
is
a
legitimate
interest.
and
there
has
been
an
expression
by
a
number
of
the
justices
of
this
court
to
suggest
that
that
interest
is,
indeed,
a
compelling
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
our
position,
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well
i
think
that,
if
i
may,
justice
stevens,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
goes
to
the
recognition
that
we
all
do,
that
there
is
in
fact
an
organism.
as,
justice....
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
state
has--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
state
has
an
interest
in
its
potential
citizen,
it
does
not
have
to
be
granted,
have
the
basis
in
the
constitution.
justice
stevens,
it
is
my
view
that
the
state
can
look
out
and
say
we,
as
we
have
historically,
regulate
and
legislate
in
the
interest
of
those
who
will
come
into
being,
who
will
be
born.
it
is
an
interest
that
every
member
of
this
court
has
said
in
potential
life.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it's
in
the
nature
of
our
system.
and
if
nothing
else,
the
tenth
amendment,
justice
stevens,
suggests
that
the
state
can
order
its
relationships
in
ways
that
reflect
the
morality
of
the
people,
within
limits.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there's
a
determination
to...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
of
course
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
as
i
have
said,
the
constitution
does
not
seek
to
order
and
to
ordain.
these
are
interests
in
which
the
state
can
have,
and
our
nature
of
government--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
doesn't
even
go
so
far,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
calibrates
it.
i
think,
justice
stevens,
it
is,
in
fact,
the
nature
of
our
governmental
structure.
i
know
no...
i
do
know
of
prohibitions
that
the
constitution
sets
forth.
i
do
not
know
of
particular
provisions,
other
than,
indeed,
perhaps
the
tenth
sheds
light
on
this.
that
this
is
a
matter
that
ultimately
is,
and
i
think
this
is
quite
important
in
terms
of
analyzing
what
pennsylvania
has
done
here.
what
pennsylvania
has
said,
in
effect,
is
that
we
will
not
prohibit
abortion,
save
for
gender
selection
abortions.
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
believe
that
roe
v.
wade
forbids
that,
that
it
protects
that
decision.
it
does
not
prohibit;
it
has
seen
fit
to
regulate.
that
is
very
much
in
the
tradition
of
the
western
democracies.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
believe
it
was
articulated,
justice
white,
by
the
webster
plurality.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
the
rational
basis
standard.
and
that
is
the
standard
that
has
been
articulated
by
this
court
in
a
variety
of
decisions
and
by
a
variety
of
justices
of
this
court,
in
its
abortion
jurisprudence.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
complete
prohibition
that
had
no
exception
for
the
life
of
mother,
i
think
could
raise
very
serious
questions
under--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
protection
of
life.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
best
not
to
answer
these
in
the
abstract.
we
look
to
the
specific
interests
of
the
state
as
it
has
articulated
those
interests.
for
example--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
the
rational
basis
standard
would,
in
fact,
allow
considerable
leeway
to
the
states,
if
it
saw
fit.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
through
the
democratic--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
so.
the
common
law,
the
common--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--ours
is
the
traditional
one.
but
under
that
traditional
analysis
there
must,
in
fact,
be
a
rational
connection
with
a
legitimate
state
interest,
and
the
state
cannot
proceed
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
fashion,
in
my
view.
if
i
may
complete
this,
i
think
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
answer.
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
would,
moreover,
deprive
an
individual
of
her
right
to
life
if
there
were
not
an
emergency
exception.
and
even
in
roe
v.
wade,
the
texas
statute
at
issue
there
provided
for
that
exception.
it
would
be
quite
at
war
with
our
traditions,
as
embodied
in
the
common
law,
not
to
provide,
at
a
minimum,
for
that
kind
of
exception.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
may
i
respond.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
does,
in
fact,
analyze
the
ends.
it
looks
at
the
ends
and
the
means.
and
it
requires,
in
fact,
that
the
state
not
conduct
itself
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
fashion.
that
is
the
ultimate
insight
of
the
rational
basis
test.
i
thank
the
court.
