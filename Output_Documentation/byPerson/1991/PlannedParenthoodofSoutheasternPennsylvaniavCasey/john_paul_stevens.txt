john
paul
stevens
no,
but
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
is
it
not
true,
therefore,
that
the
only
people
affected
by
the
statute,
this
very
small
group,
are
people
who
would
not
otherwise
notify
their
husbands?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you've
demonstrated
that
the
public
interest
is
in
a
very
limited
group
of
people,
the
few
women
who
would
not
otherwise
notify
their
husbands,
and
those
are
the
only
people
affected
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
everyone
in
that
class,
should
we
not
assume,
would
not
notify
her
husband
but
for
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
not
without
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they'd
only...
you've
already
taken
the
exceptions
into
account
in
narrowing
the
group
very...
to,
you
know,
1
percent,
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
aren't
suggesting
there's
no
one
whose
decision
will
be
affected
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
there's
no
one
affected
by
the
statute,
what
is
the
state
interest
in
upholding
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
the
undue
burden
test.
do
you
think
it
refers
to
the
number
of
persons
burdened
by
the
law
on
the
one
hand
or
the
severity
of
the
burden
on
a
particular
individual
affected
by
the
law
on
the
other
hand?
which
is
the
right
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it
is
the
number
of
persons
affected
is
your
answer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--regardless
of
how
severe
the
burden
on
a
particular
individual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
asking
you
to
explain
to
me
what
your
conception
of
the
test
that
you
are
asking
us
to
adopt
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
number
of
women
affected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
rather
basic
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
effects
the
standard
of
review
and
everything
else.
what
is
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
on
the
question
whether
a
fetus
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
addressed
in
roe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
that
we
need
not
address
it.
i'm
just
interested
to
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
the
united
states
have
a
position
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
context.
what
is
the
textual
basis
for
that
position
in
the
constitution?
is
there
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
what
is
the
textual
basis
in
the
constitution?
you
argue
very
vigorously
there's
no
textual
basis
supporting
your
opponents
position.
what
is
the
textual
basis
for
your
position
that
there's
a
compelling
interest
in
something
that
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
textual
basis
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
responsive
to
my
question.
my
question
is
what
is
the
textual
basis
in
the
constitution.
if
you're
going
to
say
there
is
none,
fine,
that's
perfectly
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
general
starr--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
not
really
a
fair
answer.
rational
basis
under
your
analysis:
there's
an
interest
in
preserving
fetal
life
at
all
times
during
pregnancy.
it's
rational,
under
your
view.
ergo
it
follows
that
a
total
prohibition,
protected
by
criminal
penalties,
would
be
rational,
it
would
meet
your
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
why
not?
in
what
proviso...
what
is
your
rational
basis
standard
if
not
the
traditional
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
what
you're
saying
is
the
rational
basis
standard,
which
normally
just
requires
a
reason
that
is
legitimate
to
support
it,
can
be
overcome
in
some
cases
by
countervailing
interest,
which
is
not
the
normal
rational
basis
standard.
