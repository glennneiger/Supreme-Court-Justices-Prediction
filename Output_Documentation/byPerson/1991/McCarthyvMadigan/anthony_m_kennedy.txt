justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
federal
regulations
explicitly
note
that
as
an
exception?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
this
petitioner
comply
with
the
15-day
period,
or
was
he
given
some
sort
of
excuse
or
extension?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
he
did...
did
he
then
file
again
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
were
talking
about
the
first
suit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
do
concede
then
that
the
government,
with
a
properly
drawn
regulation
under
its
existing
statutory
authority,
could
require
an
exhaustion
process
for
a
bivens
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
there
be
statutory
authority
for
such
a
properly
drawn
regulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
in
that
case
the
regulation
doesn't
apply
at
all
because
it
exempts
tort
claims.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
can
you
tell
me,
why
is
it
that
a
bivens
claim
can't
be
categorized
as
a
tort
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
a...
isn't
a
bivens
claim
also--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
why
isn't
it
that
a
bivens
claim
can't
be
thought
of
as
a
tort
claim
under
your
regulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
make
that...
did
it
change
that
interpretation
after
congress
passed
the
1983
grievance
process
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
been
consistent
at
all
times?
