mr.
smith,
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
justice
o'connor's
question.
what
is
your
view
about
a
mixed
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
we
don't
have
that
now.
what
about
a
mixed...
i'm
still
not
quite
clear.
what
should
a
judge
do
with
a
mixed
complaint
in
which
damages
are
sought
and
there's
been
no
exhaustion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
us
some
examples
of
bivens
claims
that
would
not
have
a
counterpart
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
congress
decided
to
do
something
like
the
legislation
involving
state
prisons,
it
could
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
are
there
any
examples
in
the
record
that
you
can
call
our
attention
to
where
the
government
has
in
fact
paid
money
to
any
prisoners
on
bivens
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
described
the
general
practice
and
what
happens,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
can
you
point
to
any
objective
support
for
the
proposition
that
in
the
past
there
have
in
fact
been
monetary
payments
on
bivens
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
settled
by
the
payment
of
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
those
claims
also
could
have
been
brought
as
federal
tort
claims
act
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
that
could
not
have
been
brought
as
federal
tort
claims
act
claims
where
a
bivens
payment
of
money
has
been
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's,
of
course,
where
the
problem
is
critical
because
there
is
a
category
of
bivens
claims
for
which
there's
no
federal
tort
claims
act
remedies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
addressed
yourself
to
that
problem,
then
i
find
you
more
persuasive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you
still
haven't
really
answered
the
question.
let
me
see
if
i
can
ask
you
another
one.
assume
a
claim
that
could
not
be
characterized
as
a
federal
tort...
discretionary
function
or
a
willful
assault
and...
there
must
be
a
category
of
a
claim
that
could
only
be
brought
as
a
bivens
action.
could
you...
do
you
have
any
statutory
authority
to
settle
that
case
for
dollars
without
recasting
it
as
a
federal
tort
claims
act
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
regulation
really
does
not
authorize
a
monetary
settlement
in
that
hypothetical
case,
which
you
say
is
a
very
rare
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
attorney
general
take
the
position
that
correction
guards
are
law
enforcement
official
representatives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
sort
of
more
basic
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
some
rule
making
that's
going
to
be
required
by
either
this
court...
you're
asking
the
court
to
approve
a
15-day
statute
of
limitations
waivable
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
isn't
this
whole
area
something
in
which
congress
could
really
do
a
much
better
job
than
we
could
of
fashioning
the
right
kind
of
rules
as
they've
done
for
state
prisoners?
why
isn't
the
right
thing
to
do
is
to
go
congress
and
get
them
to
draft
a
statute
that
will
clear
up
all
these
problems
so
we
don't
have
to
meet
them
one
at
a
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
suppose
they
wrote
a
statute
for
the
states
and
not
the...
you
think
that
the
authority
was
already
clearly
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
a
prisoner
gets
beat
up
the
day
before
he's
let
out
of
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
his
remedy
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
say
he
has
to
exhaust.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't...
do
you
require
this
procedure
in
a
federal
tort
claims
act
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
all
the
policy
arguments
apply
there
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
why
don't
they...
why
don't
you
insist
it?
why
don't
you
impose
it?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
if
you
have
this
wonderful
record
of
the
wonderful
benefits
of
15-day
rule,
why
don't
you
tell
congress
about
it
and
say,
let's
make
this
exception
for
federal
prisons?
we'd
get
tremendous
benefits
from
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
don't
have
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
important
enough
to
ask
congress
for
its
help,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
realize
that,
but
most
of
these
claims
will
be
federal
tort
claims
act.
you've
demonstrated
that
earlier.
and
i
find
it
rather
surprising
that
you
don't
have
regulations
that
would
implement
the
very
strong
policy
arguments
you've
been
making
here
in
that
area,
which
covers
most
claims.
