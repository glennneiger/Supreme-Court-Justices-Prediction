why
couldn't
we
hold
that
you
have
to
exhaust
for
that
as
well,
so
even
though
it
has
a
2-year
statute,
if
you
haven't...
if
you
rendered
it
impossible
for
you
to
exhaust,
you're
out
of
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
consider
a
bivens
claim
a
constitutional
claim,
not...
it's
not
a
sort
of
like
a
negative
commerce
clause,
our
guess
as
to
what
congress
wants
in
the
absence
of
different
provision
by
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
had
always
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose,
though,
although
you
might
not...
and
i
think
you
gave
some
persuasive
reasons
why
you
should
not
hold
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
supersedes
bivens,
what
about
the
scheme
of
remedies
provided
in
federal
prisons?
why...
i
mean
congress
has
a
number
of
statutes
that
interlock
and
that
give
prison
officials
the
right
to
establish
this
grievance
procedure
for
violations.
why
could
not
that
be
interpreted
as,
in
effect,
congress
supplanting
bivens
remedies
with
respect
to
those
matters
that
it's
given
the
prison
authorities
power
to
provide
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
monetary
relief?
i
thought
you
said
it
was
common
law
that
we're
sort
of
filling
in
the
interstices.
i
thought
congress
could
abolish
that
monetary
relief
if
they
wanted
to.
