mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
bivens
action
that
was
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
the
federal
prisoner
who
brought
the
action
had
not
exhausted
the
bureau
of
prisons
grievance
procedure.
now,
in
seeking
reversal
of
that
ruling,
we
are
not
contending
that
bivens
plaintiffs
could
never
be
required
to
exhaust
an
appropriate
administrative
procedure.
here,
however,
there
are
two
key
features
of
the
existing
grievance
procedure
that
in
our
view
make
it
fundamentally
ill-suited
to
being
the
first
stage
of
bivens
litigation
by
federal
prisoners.
first,
that
grievance
process
provides
no
remedy
whatever
to
a
potential
plaintiff
seeking
compensation
for
a
past
constitutional
injury.
second,
the
procedure
contains
a
series
of
mandatory
hurdles,
beginning
with
a
15-day
filing
deadline,
that
create
a
very
high
risk
of
inadvertent
forfeiture
of
constitutional
claims.
now,
these
features
of
the
grievance
process
are
not
surprising
in
light
of
its
origin.
what
we
have
here
is
a
process
that
was
created
to
provide
an
informal
outlet
for
any
and
all
inmate
complaints.
it's
not
limited
to
legal
claims,
it
contains
no
standards
that
have
to
be
applied,
and
it
creates
no
right
to
anything
other
than
a
written
response.
it's
basically
an
opportunity
for
a
dialogue
with
prison
administrators.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
could
be
a
situation
where
you
would
have
an
administrative
remedy
that
would
be
adequate
enough
to
justify
exhaustion,
but
not
so
comprehensive
that
you
would
want
to
give
it--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
haven't.
but
there's
an
analogy,
certainly,
under
the
civil
rights
for
institutionalized
persons
act,
where
congress
has
mandated
under
certain
circumstances
exhaustion
by
state
prisoners
in
1983
actions,
but
still
left
in
place
the
opportunity
to
go
to
court
thereafter.
and
i
think
if
you
had
a
process
similar
to
what
is
mandated
in
cripa
you
could
have
a
process,
for
example,
that
offers
$2,000
in
damages
and
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
due
process,
but
still
has
some
reason
to
exhaust
it
and
still
say
people
should
be
able
to
go
to
court
thereafter.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
he
was
transferred
to
federal
prison
temporarily
and
then
went
back
to
state
custody.
in
fact,
his
term
of
imprisonment
is
now
over.
he's
not
in
prison
anywhere
at
this
moment,
your
honor.
he
left
federal
custody
last
spring.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
this
case
entirely
involves
damages,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
never
any
claim
for
anything
else
in
this
case.
now,
consider
what
happens
when
you
take
this
informal
process
that
i
described,
this
dialogue
process,
and
you
import
it
into
the
bivens
litigation
system
and
say
it
has
to
be
pursued
in
every
case
where
somebody's
trying
to
get
to
court
on
a
damages
claim.
basically
what
you
do
at
that
point
is
you
say,
this
prisoner
who
is
trying
to
get
compensation
for
his
injury
has
to
exhaust
a
system
that
doesn't
provide
any
compensation,
and
has
three
tiers
of
review.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
get
a
little
bit
concrete
about
how
this
works
in
practice.
imagine
a
prisoner
like
petitioner,
who
is
complaining
about
the
medical
care
he
received
in
prison.
that
prisoner
might
convince
the
warden
that...
the
initial
level
of
the
three
levels
of
the
process...
that
he
hasn't
in
fact
been
getting
very
good
medical
care.
and
the
warden
might
say
that
in
writing
in
response
to
the
grievance.
but
the
one...
the
two
things
the
warden
wouldn't
do
at
that
point,
he
wouldn't
comment
in
any
way
on
the
legal
merits
of
any
constitutional
claim
for
damages,
and
he
certainly
wouldn't
provide
any
compensation
for
any
injury
received
by
the
prisoner.
so
at
that
point
you've
got
your
grievance,
you've
gotten
some
kind
of
a
response,
even
a
somewhat
favorable
response,
but
what
are
you
supposed
to
do
when
you're
still
just
trying
to
get
to
court
on
your
constitutional
claim?
at
that
point,
apparently,
you
would
have
to
continue
exhausting
because
you
haven't
received
what
you're
seeking.
you'd
have
to
appeal
even
though
you
in
a
sense
won
at
the
initial
level.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was
limited
to
a
bivens
action
against
the
individual
medical
personnel
in
the
prison.
it
did
not
include
a
federal
tort
claims
act
claim.
it
could
have.
the
kind
of
claim
he
brought,
medical
malpractice,
could
be
brought
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
he
would
have
had
to
exhaust
the
entirely
separate
federal
tort
claims
act
administrative
procedure
before
he
could
have
brought
such
a
claim.
and
he
didn't.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
point
i
would
make
in
response
to
the
government's
argument
about
how
you
should
file
a
grievance,
because
it
might
give
you
a
settlement
under
the
tort
claims
act,
is
you've
got
two
different
procedures
here;
a
grievance
procedure
that
says
it's
not
for
tort
claims,
and
the
procedure
for
tort
claims,
which
is
an
entirely
different
part
of
the
cfr.
and
what
they're
saying
in
kind
of
a
rube
goldberg
thing,
is
you
should
go
over
to
this
procedure
because
although
it's
not
for
tort
claims,
we
might
nevertheless
consider
it
as
a
tort
claim,
and
on
our
own
initiative
offer
you
a
settlement
under
this
other
authority
over
here
that
you
haven't
pursued.
and
i
think
there
are
several
problems
with
that
kind
of
a
theory
if
you're
going
to
make
that
the
basis
for
justifying
exhaustion
of
the
grievance
procedure.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
had
this
golden
opportunity
to
get
a
settlement
offer
for
damages
by
filing
under
the
grievance
process,
which
expressly
says
it's
not
for
tort
claims
and
it
doesn't
have
any
damages
in
it.
so
there's
kind
of
a
notice
problem
to
begin
with.
i
also
think
basically
the
whole
scenario
is
a
little
bit
implausible.
the
idea
that
these
federal
prison
officials
are
sitting
around
taking
these
grievances
that
come
in
and
plucking
out
those
that
look
meritorious
and
making
on
their
own
initiative
settlement
offers
to
people
that
haven't
even
made
any
indication
that
they
want
to
pursue
a
legal
claim
for
damages,
either
under
the
tort
claims
act
or
in
court,
strikes
me
as
unlikely.
and
if
it
doesn't
happen
in
any
significant
number
of
cases,
then
it
certainly
doesn't
justify
putting
everybody
through
this
three-level
process.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
decision
was
certainly
made
by
a
pro
se
inmate
at
the
time,
and
i
actually
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
there
are
differences
between
the
two
in
terms
of
the
relief
that's
available
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--in
this
kind
of
case
you
would
have
to...
in
some
sense
the
standard
of
proof
would
be
less.
it
would
be
more
of
a
negligence
case
than
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
that
you'd
have
to
meet
under
estelle
v.
gamble
in
a
medical
constitutional
case
under
bivens.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
he
had
brought
a
tort
claims
act...
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
has
waived
sovereign
immunity
and
therefore,
if
there
was
a
tort...
state
law
tort
committed
by
these
federal
prison--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well
that's
the...
that
whole
issue
was
discussed
at
length
in
carlson
v.
green
11
years
ago.
and
the
court
indicated
in
that
case
that
there
are
differences
between
the
two
causes
of
action,
that
bivens
claims
give
you
greater
deterrence
because
you
can
sue
the
individual
wrongdoer,
that
they
don't
depend
on
the
vagaries
of
state
law.
and
sometimes
there
is
no
state
analog,
and
you
have
no
claim
at
all
under
the
tort
claims
act,
or
there
are
exceptions
to
the
tort
claims
act.
there's
also
no
jury
trial
under
the
tort
claims
act,
and
there's
no
potential
for
punitive
damages.
so
those
are
the
four
reasons--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--more
recently,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
they
were
medical
officials
at
leavenworth
prison
in
kansas.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's
available,
sure,
but
this
is
not
the
route
that
was
pursued.
and
there
will
be...
many
case
that
could
be
brought
under
bivens
that
are
not
overlapping
with
the
tort
claims
act,
although
i
think
this
one
does.
and
so
one
of
the
things
that
one
would
have
to
do
if
you're
going
to
eliminate
bivens
cases
is
make
sure
that
you
don't
eliminate
them
in
situations
where
the
tort
claims
act--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the...
as
i
read
the
tort
claims
act
it
doesn't
say
we
bar
all
intentional
torts,
it
just
bars
specific
intentional
torts
like
assault
and
battery
and
things
like
that.
there
probably
is
room
in
there
for
some
medical
malpractice
cases
to
meet
the
deliberate
indifference
test
and
also
still
be
state
law
torts
that
would
qualify
for
the
tort
claims
act.
there
probably
is
some
overlap,
bit
it
gets
very
messy
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
separate
these
two
sets
of
claims
and
make
sure
that
they're
covered
by
both.
the
other
point
i
would
make
about
this
opportunity
that
the
petitioner
allegedly
had
to
get
a
tort
claims
act
settlement
is
if
that's
what
we're
going
to
justify
exhaustion
on
the
basis
of,
why
don't
we
just
have
exhaustion
of
a
procedure
that
directly
addresses
the
issue
of
damages?
i
mean,
the
only
reason
we're
talking
about
this
grievance
procedure
is
because
it's
the
thing
that
happens
to
by
lying
around
in
the
cfr.
but
if
exhaustion
is
going
to
be
justified
on
the
basis
that
somebody
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
seek
damages
and
this
opportunity
exists,
why
not
have
a
procedure
that
says
you
can
ask
for
damages
administratively
and
get
an
answer
to
your
request
for
damages
administratively
rather
than
going
into
this
grievance
process,
where
you
don't
even
know
whether
the
issue
of
damages
was
considered
or
not
considered.
it
depends
on
the
initiative
of
whatever
prison
official
was
responding
to
a
grievance.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
don't
dispute,
justice
o'connor,
the
possibility
that
there
are
state
interests
served
by
having
exhaustion
of
an
administrative
remedy
in
this
kind
of
case.
the
point
i
would
make,
though,
is
that
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
serve
those
state
interests
without
at
the
same
time
having
features
in
the
procedure
that
offer
a
remedy
and
at
the
same
time
don't
interfere
with
the
legitimate
interests
of
the
prisoner.
why
not...
there's
no
reason
those
couldn't
be
served
equally
well
in
a
more
adequate
administrative
process.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
don't
think
it
would
depend
on
the
individual
case.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
in
the
grievance
process
there
is
no
compensatory
remedy.
so
if
you're
talking
about
a
bivens
claim,
then
i
think
you
can
decide
that
issue
and
say
we're
going
to
exhaust...
we're
going
to
require
exhaustion
in
pure
bivens
cases.
where
the
issue
is
damages,
there
ought
to
be
a
compensatory
remedy
of
some
magnitude
available
in
the
administrative
process.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
this
were
a
suit
against
state
prison
officials,
in
most
states
there
would
be
no
exhaustion,
because
in
most
states
the
standards
of
cripa
have
not
been
met
and
the
general
rule
that
there's
no
exhaustion
in
1983
cases
would
apply.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
that's
cripa,
the
civil
rights
for
institutionalized
persons
act.
and
it
requires
that
either
the
attorney
general
or
a
court
certify
that
the
state
exhaustion...
the
state
grievance
procedure
meets
certain
standards
before
they
will
require
exhaustion.
and
as
i
understand
it,
it's
only
about
10
states
where
that
has
occurred
in
most
cases.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
that's
not
right.
the
court,
first
of
all,
has
discretion
about
whether
to
require
exhaustion
under
cripa.
and
the
attorney
general
in
putting
out
the
regulations
in
1980
indicated
if
it's
a
pure
damages
case
and
the
state
does
not
provide
compensation,
the
court
shouldn't
require
exhaustion.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
at
all.
the
other
thing
about
cripa
is
you
file
your
case
in
court,
and
then
it's
held
for
90
days.
so
you
don't
have
this
other
problem
which
i
want
to
get
to,
this
potential
forfeiture
of
claims
by
failure
to
file
the
grievance
very
quickly
before
you
get
to
court.
and
i
think
that
is
in
fact
maybe
even
a
more
serious
problem
with
this
argument
for
exhaustion
in
this
case,
is
the
deadlines
that
you
have
to
meet
and
the
hurdles
you
have
to
get
over,
and
the
risk
of
forfeiture
of
constitutional
claims
that
it
creates.
i
mean,
you
look
at
this
procedure,
you
have
to
file
your
grievance
within
15
days
of
a
constitutional
deprivation.
and
in
fact,
i
think
that's
an
overly
generous
way
of
describing
it.
what
the
regulations
actually
say
is
you
have
to
complete
whatever
informal
grievance
resolution
procedures
the
prison
may
have
in
place
and
then
file
your
formal
grievance...
all
within
that
15-day
period
after
the
alleged
constitutional
violation
occurred.
at
leavenworth
what
that
in
means
in
practice
is
you
have
to
file
two
forms:
file
an
informal
form,
get
a
response,
and
then
file
your
formal
form
all
within
15
days.
and
then
when
you
lose,
which
is
inevitable
if
you're
seeking
damages,
since
it
doesn't
provide
damages,
you
have
to
appeal
to
the
regional
level
and
you
have
to
appeal
to
the
central
office
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
the
first
one
has
a
20-day
deadline,
the
second
one
has
a
30-day
deadline.
i
submit
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
system
that
could
be
better
designed
to
make
it
likely
that
people
who
aren't
represented
by
counsel
will
make
a
foot
fault
and
forfeit
their
constitutional
claims.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
this
petitioner
went
directly
to
court
thinking
that
he
didn't
have
to
exhaust
because
it
was
a
pure
damages
claim.
it
was
dismissed.
he
then
went
back
and
tried
to
exhaust.
and
his
claim
actually
went
up
to
the
second
level,
the
regional
level,
and
was
a
few
days
late
and
was
dismissed
for
being
untimely
at
the
second
level
back
in
the
summer
of
1990.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
we're
just
reviewing
the
initial--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yeah.
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust.
what
he
argued
to
the
court
in
the
district
court
was
essentially
what
we're
arguing
here,
that
because
it's
a
damages
case,
exhaustion
shouldn't
be
required,
as
several
circuits
have
held.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
he
included
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
that
the
consensus
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
in
an
injunctive
case
you
do
have
to
exhaust
because
there's
clearly
a
remedy.
they
can
stop
doing
whatever
they're
doing.
and
the
15-day
deadline
is
also
a
much
less
serious
problem
in
the
case
involving
prospective
relief
because
if
they're
doing
something
every
day,
and
you
miss
the
deadline,
you
can
just
file
it
again.
there's
no
forfeiture
problem
when...
because
the
clock
essentially
keeps
running
continuously
for
an
ongoing
problem
as
to
which
you're
seeking
prospective
relief.
so
both
the
forfeiture
problem
and
the
remedy
problem
are
quite
different
in
an
injunctive
case,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
clear
that
no
court
has
ever
held
that
you
should
be
able
to
go
and
seek
an
injunction
against
federal
prison
conditions
without
trying
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--okay.
a
mixed
complaint,
i
think,
ought
to
be
held
as
well.
i
think
that
that
probably
is
the
right
way
to
handle
it,
that
if
you
have
both,
you
ought
to
go
ahead
and
file.
now,
there
could
be
different
ways
to
handle
it.
it
does
get
messy.
for
example,
someone
might
file
a
damages
complaint
and
then
still
seek
prospective
relief
from
the
grievance
process
and
kind
of
split
his
claim
that
way.
and
it
does
get
messy.
i
think
the
right
way
to
handle
that,
frankly,
is
to
have
a
grievance
process
that
has
some
compensation
in
it
and
make
everybody
with
every
kind
of
complaint
exhaust
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
guess
my
view,
justice
stevens,
would
be
that
the
court
ought
to
hold
on
to
the
damages
element
of
the
case
and
tell
them
to
go
exhaust
on
the
prospective
relief
and
come
back
and
then
litigate
the
case
at
that
stage
so
that
there's
no
waste
of
judicial
resources
at
the
same
time
that
the
case
is
held
at
the
district
court
level.
now,
this
kind
of
maze
that
you
have
to
go
through,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
would
never
tolerate
in
any
other
context.
and
i
would
point
out
that
one
thing
that
it
does
is
it
creates
severe
discrimination
against
federal
constitutional
claims
vis-a-vis
state
law
claims.
for
example,
a
prisoner
who
wants
to
bring
a
common
law
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
has
2
years
by
statute
to
file
his
initial
administrative
form.
but
if
he
wants
to
bring
the
same
complaint
under
the
constitution
under
bivens,
he
has
this
15-day
deadline.
and
this
court
has
many
times
noted,
certainly
in
wilson
v.
garcia
and
felder
v.
casey
and
elsewhere
that
in
the
1983
context
such
discrimination
against
federal
claims
is
a
severe
problem
in
examining
the
kinds
of
statute
of
limitations
that
might
or
might
not
be
borrowed
from
state
law
in
the
1983
context.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that
may
be.
i
guess...
the
federal
tort
claims
act
can
be
viewed
as
a
federal
remedy
or
as
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
on
state
claims.
and
i
guess
in
some
sense
it
is
a
federal
remedy,
certainly
because
it
creates
a
different
defendant,
the
united
states,
rather
than
the
individual
tort
feasor.
that's
true.
the
underlying
issues,
though,
certainly
are
state
law
tort
issues.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
what
the
statute
says--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--what
the
statute
says
is
that
you
have
2
years
to
file
your
administrative
claim
with
the
agency
that
administers
your...
that
involves
the
torts.
so
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
this
court
to
require
some
prior
administrative
filing
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
because
the
statute
is
quite
clear
that
you
have
that
2-year
period
for
your
initial
administrative
filing.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
there
are,
for
example,
intentional
assaults
under
the
tort
claim...
are
not
covered
under
the
tort
claims
act.
there
is
an
exception
for
law
enforcement
officials
who
do
commit
intentional
assaults,
that
is
covered.
so
the
question
then
is
what
are
prison
guards,
what
are
prison
medical
doctors?
are
they
law
enforcement
people?
and
that's
an
unsettled
question.
discretionary
functions
are
not
covered
under
the
tort
claims
act,
and
they
could
still
give
rise
to
constitutional
claims...
if
you
were
put
into
maximum
security
for
some
punitive
reason
related
to
your
exertion
of
first
amendment
rights,
things
like
that.
there
are
others,
as
well.
but
there
certainly
are
some
cases.
now,
i
want
to
recognize
again
that
first
of
all,
there's
legitimate
concern
in
all
courts
about
frivolous
prison
litigation
and
the
number
of
cases
that
are
being
filed.
the
point
i
would
make
about
that
is
that
this
maze
of
hurdles
that
you
have
to
go
through
is
not
a
legitimate
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
who's
going
to
be
injured
by
it?
not
the
person
who
files
25
cases
a
year,
who's
a
litigious
prisoner.
it's
the
unsophisticated
prisoner
who
may
have
a
very
serious
injury,
but
may
not
realize
for
a
few
weeks
or
months
that
he
has
a
constitutional
claim,
at
which
time
it
will
be
too
late.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
don't
believe
the
government
could
require
it.
i
do
think
the
government
could
create
an
appropriate
process
and
ask
this
court
to
require
it
as
the
institution
that
controls
bivens
procedure
in
the
absence
of
action
by
congress.
i
don't
know
that
an
executive
official
can
put
out
a
regulation
that
says,
in
constitutional
litigation
here's
the
route
you
have
to
follow.
but
i
think
if
they
create
a
procedure
that's
available
that
provides
some
compensation
and
gives
you
fair
deadlines
to
meet
and
not
lots
of
hurdles
to
cross
over,
this
court,
i
think,
could
reasonably
at
that
point,
even
without
action
by
congress,
require
exhaustion.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
certainly
there
would
be
no
problem
with
them
creating
a
procedure
that
doesn't
have
a
15-day
deadline
and
three
levels
of
review.
whether
they
have
statutory
authority
to
provide
monetary
compensation
on
bivens
claims
at
the
administrative
level
before
they're
filed
in
court
is
an
issue
on
which
i...
perhaps
they
could
provide
a
better
answer
than
i
can,
your
honor.
i
think
they
probably
could
because
they
already
have
a
regulation
that
seems
to
provide
settlements
to,
in
cases
involving
federal
employees,
after
they're
in
court...
that's
50.15,
28
cfr.
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
statutory
authority
for
that
either.
so
i
assume
they
could
probably
back
that
up
to
the
administrative
level
if
they
wanted
to
and
create
an
analog
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
administrative
procedure
for
bivens
claims.
indeed,
they
probably
could
be
built
in
together.
you
file
in
one
place
for
both
kinds
of
procedures.
you
get
an
answer,
we'll
give
you
some
money
or
we
won't
at
that
point,
and
then
go
to
court.
i
think
they
probably
have
statutory
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
absolutely.
congress
could
do
that.
the
only
thing
that
would
limit
what
congress
could
do
would
be
constitutional
limitations.
and
i
think
there
might
be
some
if
congress
created
a
procedure
that
was
so
unfair
that...
you
know,
if
they
gave
you
20
minutes
to
file
your
constitutional
claim,
or
something
like
that.
but
other
than
that,
congress
has
the
authority
certainly
to
do
that.
now,
let
me
just--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
i
guess
it
is
a
remedy
for
a
constitutional
claim.
clearly,
it
has
to
be...
the
underlying
violation
has
to
be
a
constitutional
claim.
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
requirement
that
this
remedy
exists
in
the
absence
of
congress,
or
whether
it's
a
common
law
decision
by
this
court--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
of
it
as
a
common
law
decision
by
this
court,
just
as
the
court
makes
decisions
in
the
statutory
area
or
in
other
kinds
of...
or
state
law
courts
make
in
other
common
law
areas,
this
is
the
kind
of
field
of
federal
common
law
that
has
been
created
to
help
enforce
the
constitution
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
if
there
were
a
procedure
created
by
congress
that
provided
compensatory
relief
of
a
substantial
nature
and
had
due
process
for
that
claim,
i
think
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
this
court
could
very
seriously
consider
the
issue,
as
in
bush
v.
lucas
or
schweiker
v.
chilicky,
the
issue
of
whether
that
preempts
bivens
claims.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
only
point
i'm
making
now
is
that
if
you're
going
to
eliminate
bivens
on
the
basis
of
some
remedy
that
exists,
it
ought
to
be
a
significant
remedy,
or
there
at
least
ought
to
be
some
affirmative
indication
from
congress
that
it
doesn't
think
there
should
be
compensation,
because
this
court
has
already
indicated
its
judgment
that
compensation
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
and
i
would
think
at
that
point
you'd
want
to
wait
for
a
pretty
strong
indication
from
congress
to
get
rid
of
compensation
all
together.
the
other
point
i'd
make
is
it's
not
like
congress
has
specifically
encouraged
grievance
procedures
or
authorized
this
specifically.
this
is
entirely
a
creation
of
bureau
of
prisons
under
statutes
which
say
things
like,
you're
authorized
to
run
the
prisons.
just
one
more
point
about
congress,
and
then
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
i
do
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
cripa
does
not
support
exhaustion
in
this
case
for
the
reasons
that
i
said
before.
cripa
first
of
all
prevents
forfeitures
of
claims
because
you
file
in
federal
court
first.
they
then
hold
the
case
for
90
days,
and
say
go
exhaust
there.
so
you
don't
have
this
inadvertent
forfeiture
beforehand
based
on
some
state
law
deadline
for
your
grievance.
and
as
i
said
before,
the
attorney
general
took
the
view
when
the
regulations
under
cripa
were
put
out,
that
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
a
futile
procedure.
if
you
have
a
damages
claim,
and
there
are
no
damages
available,
then
you
don't
have
to
exhaust.
so
cripa,
if
anything,
supports
our
side
in
the
case.
the
point
i'd
make
is
ultimately
you...
there
could
be
a
procedure.
it's
just
that
they
haven't
created
it
yet.
and
there's
no
reason
to
rush
to
borrow
this
one
because
it
happens
to
be
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
even
though
it's
clearly
inadequate
for
the
reasons
i've
stated.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
quick
points.
first
of
all,
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
can
be
extensions
of
time
of
the
15-day
deadline,
ms.
mahoney
referred
to
it
as
a
mandatory
requirement
that
they
get
extensions.
but
it's
mandatory
only
where
somebody
determines
that
there's
a
valid
reason
for
the
extension.
and
the
regulations
provide
no
standards
whatever
for
what
reasons
will
be
considered
valid
or
invalid.
so
you're
left
either
with
two
possibilities
on
this
extension
of
the
15-day
deadline.
either
it's
going
to
be
entirely
up
to
the
unguided
discretion
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
decide
when
to
give
an
extension,
or...
and
ms.
mahoney
suggests
this
is
what
would
really
happen...
you're
going
to
kick
this
issue
over
to
the
courts.
and
whenever
somebody
doesn't
get
the
extension,
they're
going
to
be
in
court
saying,
well
i
should
have
gotten
it
because
i
had
a
valid
reason,
and
this
court's
going
to
have
to
develop
a
whole
new
jurisprudence
about
which
reasons
are
valid
and
which
ones
aren't,
exactly
similar
to
the
habeas
situation,
which--
all
this
arises
because
you
have
a
procedure
which
was
not
created
with
litigation
in
mind.
and
if
you
had
a
situation...
procedure
that
was
created
as
a
basis,
as
a
possible
prelude
to
litigation,
you
wouldn't
have
a
standardless
provision
like
we'll
give
you
an
extension
when
you
have
a
valid
reason.
you'd
have
something
entirely
different.
also
on
that
point,
the
suggestion
was
made
that
this
issue
hasn't
arisen
in
the
courts,
and
therefore
it
must
not
be
creating
a
lot
of
problems.
but
the
reality
is
that
they
only
require...
the
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
the
grievance
procedure
only
exists
in
the
tenth
circuit.
in
other
places
the
requirement
in
damages
cases
does
not
apply.
so
people
have
no
reason
to
end
up
in
court
fighting
about
extensions
of
time
on
the
grievance
process.
on
the
issue
of
whether
people
might
be
satisfied
by
some
relief
other
than
compensation,
and
therefore
there
might
be
some
purpose
served
by
people...
making
people
go
through
the
grievance
process,
obviously
that
is
a
possibility,
but
it's
not
an
interest
which
can
justify
requiring
everybody
to
exhaust.
the
respondent's
brief
says
that
you
still
have
to
exhaust
this
process
when
you're
out
of
prison
altogether
when
the
only
interest
it
could
possibly...
the
only
interest
that
you
could
possibly
have
is
a
compensatory
interest,
but
they
still
want
you
to
exhaust
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that
is
a
different
argument.
i
think
the
problem
with
that
argument
from
the
government's
point
of
view
is
they
are
making
contradictory
points.
first
they're
saying
everybody's
rushing
off
to
court
to
bring
these
bivens
claims,
and
at
the
same
time,
they're
saying
they're
not
getting
adequate
notice
of
what's
going
on
in
the
prison
in
time
to
fix
it.
the
third
thing
that
ms.
mahoney
now
says,
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
situation
this
doesn't
arise
because
95
percent
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
claims
do
get
brought
to
the
grievance
procedure
within
that
2-year
period
before
they
go
to
the
tort
claims
act
procedure...
so
they're
sort
of
telling
us
everybody's
going
to
file
a
grievance,
everybody's
rushing
off
to
court.
but
at
the
same
time,
that
somehow
they
just
don't
know
what's
going
on
in
these
prisons
and
they
don't
have
enough
notice
about
which
guard
is
beating
up
on
people.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
arguments
don't
make
any
sense
if
you
put
them
right
next
to
each
other.
the
final
point
about
this
idea
that
you're
going
to
get
federal
tort
claims
act
monetary
settlements,
first
of
all,
it
ignores
entirely
the
issue
of
notice.
nobody
in
any
court
that
i'm
aware
of
has
ever
suggested
until
after
cert
was
granted
in
this
case
that
the
reason
we
were
going
to
go
through
this
grievance
process
in
bivens
cases
is
because
of
a
monetary
settlement
you
might
get
under
the
tort
claims
act.
and
every
court
that's
looked
at
this
issue,
including
the
tenth
circuit,
has
assumed
there's
no
damages
available,
that
damages
is
not
something
that
justifies
sending
people
through
the
grievance
process.
and
petitioner
certainly
had
no
reason
to
know
otherwise.
