if
there
is
an
adequate
administrative
remedy,
then
is
there
a
bivens
option
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
had
a
situation
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
this
prisoner
is
no
longer
in
federal
prison,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
government
refers
to
the
capacit
of
the
prison
to
give
some
money
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
says
that
presents
the
situation
you
have
described,
that
they
do
have
the
power
to
give
some
money
now,
does
the
cause
of
action
of
this
plaintiff
incorporate
a
federal
tort
claims
act
claim?
and
is
that
in
fact
available?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
still
may
be
some
benefits
though,
i
suppose,
by
having
a
prompt
administrative
look
at
the
facts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
may
be
some
public
benefit
to
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
have
to
look
on
a
case-by-case
basis
at
whether
the
remedy,
the
administrative
remedy
is
adequate,
or
do
we
take
a
more
global
look
at
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
he
had
included
in
the
complaint
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
as
a
prayer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
there
it
might
make
a
difference
for
administrative
procedure.
but
would
you
still
be
here
arguing
that
the
15-day
deadline
makes
it
inadequate
even
if
injunctive
relief
were
sought?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
prison
did
not
excuse
a
delay
in
filing
an
administrative
grievance,
would
the
bivens
action,
then,
have
to
be
dismissed
by
the
court
for
the
failure
to
exhaust
in
a
timely
fashion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
procedure,
the
grievance
procedure
is
adequate
when
only
monetary
damages
are
sought
as
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
mahoney,
though,
it
says
in
the
regulation
filings
will
not
be
accepted
under
the
administrative
remedy
procedure
for
tort
claims.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
particular
claim
is
a
pure
federal
tort
claims
act
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
covers
his
entire
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
the
regulation
be
rewritten
to
make
that
clear
if
that's
the
situation?
