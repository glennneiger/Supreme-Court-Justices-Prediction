ms.
mahoney,
what
if
the
prisoner
is
beat
up
and
unconscious
in
the
hospital
for
2
weeks?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
provisions
for
excuses?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
that's
pretty
speculative
on
your
part,
isn't
it,
ms.
mahoney?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
heard
you
say
probably
he
wouldn't
bring
his
case.
probably.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
agree
with
all
that,
but
nevertheless,
you
were
confronted
with
the
fact
there's
no
provision
for
damages
in
a
grievance
procedure,
is
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
petitioner,
mccarthy,
when
he
was
a
federal
prisoner
sued
the
respondent,
prison
officials,
for
damages
for
alleged
violations
of
his
eighth
amendment
rights
due,
it
was
said,
to
deliberate
indifference
to
his
needs
in
medical
condition
resulting
from
a
back
operation
and
psychiatric
problems.
and
this
was
a
case
of
the
kind
represented
by
what
we
call
the
bivens
decision
here
a
few
years
ago.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
compliant
on
the
ground
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
provided
by
the
bureau
of
prisons,
and
that
included
rapid
filing
and
response
time
tables
with
no
provision
for
a
hearing
on
the
granting
of
any
particular
type
of
relief.
petitioner
further
argued
that
the
exhaustion
was
not
required
because
he
sought
only
money
damages
which
the
bureau
could
not
provide
anyway.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
exhaustion
of
the
bureau's
administrative
procedures
not
required
before
a
federal
prisoner
can
initiate
a
bivens
action
solely
for
money
damages.
federal
courts
must
exercise
sound
judicial
discretion
in
these
circumstances
by
balancing
the
plaintiff's
interest
in
prompt
access
to
a
federal
judicial
forum
against
institutional
interest
favoring
exhaustion.
here,
congress
does
not
require
exhaustion
and
mccarthy's
individual
interest
outweigh
the
institutional
interest.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas.
