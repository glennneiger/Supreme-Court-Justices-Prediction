ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dispute
in
this
case
really
has
come
down
to
it's
not
a
question
of
power.
everyone
here
is
in
agreement
that
this
court
has
the
discretion
to
require
exhaustion
of
this
procedure
as
part
of
its
power
to
fashion
an
appropriate
bivens
remedy.
the
issue
really
is
whether
or
not
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
designed
an
appropriate
grievance
procedure.
and
that
issue,
we
submit,
is
firmly
entrusted
to
the
bop
and
its
expert
judgment
about
what's
going
to
work
in
this
prison
system.
the
way
that
the
system
is
designed
is
to
serve
a
variety
of
purposes.
and
in
fact,
the
petitioner
does
not
dispute
that
this
system
does
serve
very,
very
important
institutional
purposes.
the
15-day
requirement
that
they
say
is
so
prejudicial
to
the
inmate
is
for
the
benefit
of
not
only
the
inmate
complaining
but
also
the
other
inmates
within
that
system.
unless
the
prison
has--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
that
would
be...
he
would
certainly
be
excused
from
meeting
the
15-day
deadline.
if
i
could
just
describe
how
the
15-day
deadline
works,
i
think
it
would
satisfy
any
concern
that
this
is
somehow--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--absolutely,
your
honor.
the
regulations
specifically
provide
that
the
inmate
is
to
file
his
complaint,
which
is
a
simple
one-page
statement,
within
15
days
of
the
date
of
occurrence,
but
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
shall...
and
i
emphasize
shall...
waive
that
time
limit
if
there
is
any,
quote,
"valid
reason
for
delay".
and
even
if
there
is
no
valid
reason
for
delay,
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
retain
discretion
to
waive
the
time
limits.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i've
been
in
a
state
prison.
i
don't
believe
i've
ever
been
in
a
federal
prison.
they
do
retain
the
authority
to
waive
the
time
limits,
and
as
i
indicated,
it
is
mandatory
if
there's
any
valid
reason.
in
practice,
it
is
liberally
applied.
in
fact,
in
cases
such
as
mr.
mccarthy's,
where
the
allegation
is
one
of
medical
negligence,
it
is
the
practice
of
the
bop
not
to
hold
them
to
the
15-day
requirement
even
if
they
miss
it,
because
of
the
serious
nature
of
the
problems
that
stem
from
having
doctors
who
are
not
carefully
treating
patients.
and
in
fact,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
case,
when
mr....
the
record
indicates
from
the
tenth
circuit
that
when
mr.
mccarthy
went
back
to
the
prison
to
try
to
exhaust
his
claim,
the
warden
did
in
fact
investigate
his
claim
of
medical
malpractice,
even
though
it
was
filed
more
than
2
weeks
late,
and
did
not
dismiss
it
for
lack
of
timeliness.
it
was
only
after
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
regional
director
2
days
late
that
it
was
dismissed,
that
the
appeal
was
dismissed
for
untimeliness.
but
there
was
an
investigation
of
the
facts
and
it
was
considered
on
the
merits.
and
we
don't
know
why
mr.
mccarthy--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
up
to
this
court
in
its
equitable
discretion
to
determine
whether
the
reason
for
failure
to
follow
the
procedural
rules
established
by
the
system
should
be
excused.
that's
precisely
the
type
of
analysis
that
this
court
has
conducted
for
years
in
the
habeas
context.
and
in
cases
where
there
is
a
deliberate
bypass
of
those
procedural
rules,
the
court
has
not
excused
the
failure.
and
i
think
the
same
should
apply
in
this
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
have
to
measure
the
system
in
accordance
with
the
way
it
works
in
practice.
even
though
mr.
mccarthy
may
say
he
only
wants
damages,
in
most
cases
there
are
other
things
that
the
inmate
wants.
in
this
case,
he
wanted
more
medication.
he
wanted
different
medication.
he
wanted
a
new
cell.
if
in
fact
he
had
filed
his
grievance
and
the
warden
had
decided
to
give
him
any
one
of
those
things,
he
probably
never
would
have
filed
his
damage
action.
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
in
fact
found
in
the
catalanotto
case
dealing
with
1997(e)
procedures.
it
said
even
if
there
is
no
monetary
remedy,
we
still
should
require
exhaustion
because
in
many
of
these
cases
there
will
be
a
remedy
that
satisfies
the
inmate,
even
though
he
claims
he
only
wants
damages.
second,
in
this
case--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
speculative
at
all.
it's
the
practice--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
experience
of
the
bop
is
that
many,
many
inmates
who
obtain
some
sort
of
relief
in
the
administrative
process
never
file
a
claim
even
if
they
theoretically,
or
even
if
they've
asked
for
money
to
begin
with.
it
simply...
and
in
addition,
your
honor,
they
also
find
that
many
never
file
a
claim
even
if
they
don't
get
relief.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
these...
that
prisoners
often
have
a
motivation
to
sue
for
harassment
and
intimidation
and
that
if
we
make
it
easy
for
them
to
file
a
complaint
in
federal
court
against
one
of
their
guards
or
their
doctor
the
day
that
they
have
a
disagreement
with
them--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
there
is
the
potential
to
settle
the
claim.
and
i
will
turn
to
that
right
now.
this
works
both
as...
this
procedure
works
as
an
opportunity
for
the
bop
to
give
an
administrative
remedy
such
as
new
medication
or
changing
a
cell,
but
it
also
works
as
an
opportunity
to
give
them
notice
of
a
claim
so
that
they
can
use
their
settlement
authority
to
settle
the
claim
if
they
believe
there
is
some
merit
or--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
there
is
no
record
in
this
case
to
speak
of.
the
government--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
can
do,
i'd
be
happy
to
submit
something
supplemental.
i
can
make
a
representation
to
this
court
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
that
yes,
in
fact
there
are
claims
that
have
been
asserted
by
inmates
in
this
grievance
procedure,
that
theoretically
could
have
been
cast
as
bivens
claims
that
have
been
settled.
because
what--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--settled
by
the
payment
of
money.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
because
the
way
this
works
is
that
the
inmate
files
his
notice--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
in
settlement
or
after
judgment?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
i
can--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
could--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--all
right,
i'll
address
myself
to
that
one.
i
think
that
that
category
is
probably
quite
small
because
if
we
look
to
the
ftca--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
is
in...
excuse
me,
it
is
in
the
category
of
cases
that
could
be
settled
under
ftca
authority,
your
honor,
because
this
case,
while
he
claims
it
is
a
bivens
case,
a
case
of
deliberate
indifference,
it
certainly
can
also
be
characterized
as
a
malpractice
claim,
which
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
separate
procedure
for
tort
claims,
but
it's
not
that
it
does
not
apply.
if
the
inmate
brings
the
grievance
to
the
attention
of
the
prison
officials
through
this
administrative
remedy
process,
and
they
wish
to
treat
it
as
a
claim
that
could
be
settled
under
its
ftca
authority,
they
simply
ask
the
inmate
to
file
an
additional
form
and
exercise
their
authority
to
settle
the
claim.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
the
way
that
that
has
been
applied
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
if
an
inmate
says
the
only
thing
i
want
is
a
federal
tort
claims
act
suit,
they
will
treat
it
as
an
fta
suit
which
has
a
separate
administrative
claims
process.
and
let
me
explain
why
there's
a
separate
process.
congress
established
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
there
should
be
administrative
exhaustion
of
ftca
claims,
and
they
provided
a
variety
of
aspects
of
that
system.
and
it
has
not
been
up
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
establish
its
own
system
for
pure
ftca
claims.
and
for
that
reason
those,
the
pure
ftca
claim
needs
to
be...
it's
a
very
similar
process,
but
it
has
some
separate
provisions.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
he
has
styled
it
as
both
a...
he
has
styled
it
as
a
bivens
action.
it's
a
question
of--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
if
he
were
correct
that
these
doctors
engaged
in
wanton
and
deliberate
conduct
subjecting
him
maliciously
to
injury,
he
might
well
be
entitled
to
damages
above
and
beyond
that
which
he
could
get
in
a
federal
tort
claims
act
suit.
but
your
honor,
we're
not
submitting
that
he's
required
to
take
a
settlement
under
our
ftca
authority.
he
would
certainly
have
the
option,
if
we
offered
him
money...
if
we
said
we
can
settle
your
claim
and
we'd
like
to
do
so,
he
could
say
no,
thank
you
very
much,
i
have
finished
my
exhaustion,
and
i'm
heading
to
federal
court
because
what
i
want
are
punitive
damages
paid
out
of
the
pockets
of
these
defendants.
he
retains
that
right.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
an
opportunity
to
let
the
grievance
process
work,
to
let
us
sort
through
these
claims.
let
us
determine
if
there
is
some
way
to
settle
it
short
of
coming
to
federal
court.
it's
a
very
quick
process,
it's
an
easy
process.
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
remedy
is
complete
within
3
months.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
this
could
be
categorized
as
either
a
bivens
claim
or
a
tort
claim.
there's
an
overlap.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
under
our
regulation?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
because
simply,
it
could
be
except
that
it's
not.
the
bop
established
this
regulation
and
it's
interpreted
its
own
authority,
and
it
has
consistently
interpreted
it
to
apply
to
any
claim
relating
to
any
aspect
of
imprisonment,
except
for
those
claims
in
which
a
prisoner
says
i
want
an
ftca
remedy
only.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
it
has
been
using
the
regulation
in
this
way
for--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
it's
been
consistent
at
all
times.
i
don't
know
enough
about
what
other
things
may
have
happened
in
the
past,
but
i
can
say
that
there
has
been
a
persistent
effort
to
require
inmates
to
bring
any
kind
of
grievance
that
they
have,
whatever
it
relates
to
through
this
process,
because
it
serves
such
important
interests
of
the
institution
to
get
notice
within
15
days
to
investigate
it
and
to
serve
its
purposes.
i
don't
think
that
this
inmate--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
if
that's
what
required,
bop
certainly
would
do
that.
but
i
think
that
that
would
be
sort
of
an
unnecessary
hurdle
at
this
point.
there's
no
indication
that
this
inmate,
that
mr.
mccarthy
did
not
understand
that
the
bop
in
fact
required
him
to
bring
this
claim
under
his
administrative...
under
the
administrative
grievance
process.
and
in
fact,
when
he
filed
his
federal
action...
the
tenth
circuit's
been
quite
clear
on
it,
your
honor,
for
more
than
10
years
since
brice
v.
day.
so
this
inmate
knew,
and
in
fact
he
fully
briefed
the
issue
of
the
exhaustion
cases
in
other
circuits
at
the
time
that
he
went
to
federal
court.
in
addition,
the
judge
in
this
case
dismissed
his
claim
for
failure
to
exhaust,
telling
him
he
needed
to
go
exhaust
before
his
15
days
had
even
expired.
so
he
didn't
lack
notice
that
he
was
required
to
do
it.
and
when
he
filed
his
grievance
with
the
warden,
they
didn't
reject
it
because
it
was
a
tort
claim.
they
went
ahead
and
considered
it
on
the
merits,
had
a
factual
investigation,
and
responded
to
him
saying
that
they
thought
what
was
appropriate
was
for
him
to
get
psychiatric
care,
and
they
were
making
it
available.
so
it
is
clear
from
this
record
that
they
have
in
fact
encouraged
inmates
to
use
this
grievance
system
and
that
it
has
in
practice
not
worked
any
undue
prejudice.
again,
though,
if
mr.
mccarthy
came
to
the
federal
district
court,
filed
a
new
complaint
and
said,
i
didn't
exhaust
because
it
was
absolutely
unclear
that
i
had
to
resort
to
that
procedure,
that
would
presumably
be
a
reason
to
provide
equitable
relief.
on
this
record,
though,
it
is
clear
that
he
cannot
say
that.
he
knew
he
was
required
to
exhaust,
the
court
told
him
so.
and
the
warden
went
ahead
and
considered
his
claim,
even
though
it
was
2
weeks
late.
so
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
this
particular
procedure
does
not
spell
out
what
relief
will
be
available
and
whether
it
be
monetary
or
nonmonetary.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
attorney
general
has
delegated
authority
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
settle
claims
for
tortious
conduct
against
federal
prison
officials
pursuant
to
the
authority
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
it's
all
a
question
of
characterization.
mr.
mccarthy
could
have
easily
styled
this
action
as
an
ftca
claim,
and
certainly
in
our
settlement
powers
we
could
characterize
it
as
exactly
that.
we
could
say,
look,
you
called
this
a
bivens
action,
but
what
you're
really
complaining
about
is
the
malpractice
of
our
doctors.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
he
would
have
the
option,
if
he
chose
to
go
to
federal
court
and
try
to
do
that.
and
no,
we
couldn't
pay
him
a
settlement
for
punitive
damages.
but
if
we
offered
him
$2,500
or
$5,000
under
our
ftca
authority,
he
might
well
jump
at
the
chance.
and
in
fact,
i'd
be
highly
surprised
if
he
didn't,
your
honor.
so
i
think
that
while
he
may
want
to
characterize
it
as
a
bivens
action
when
he
arrives
at
the
courthouse,
that
doesn't
eliminate
the
fact
that
he
may
be
quite
content.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
attorney
general
does,
but
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
not.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
on
that
point,
in
terms
of
it
being
a
very
rare
case,
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
intentional
claims
for
assault
and
battery
by
law
enforcement
officials
are
still
compensable
torts
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
think
congress
already
delegated
the
power
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
come
up
with
a
system
that's
workable.
and
that's
what
we
have
here--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
under
18
usc,
section
4001,
the
congress
established
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
system
of
government
for
prisons,
to
control
and
manage
and
adopt
whatever
regulations
are
necessary.
these
regulations
governing
the
administrative
grievance
procedure
are
really
a
fundamental
part
of
the
government
of
those
prisons.
it
is
of
critical
importance
not
just
to
reduce
the
need
for
answering
complaints
in
federal
court,
but
also
to
provide
a
system
where
prisoners
will
have
some
recourse,
will
have
some
chance
to
meet
with
prison
officials
to
talk
about
their
concerns,
and
to
obtain
speedy
and
effective
relief.
and
that's
what
this
system
does,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
if
a
prisoner
gets
beat
up--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--if
he
got
beat
up
the
day
before,
i
would
still
believe--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
would
still
believe
that
he
would
have
to
exhaust.
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
your
honor,
is
because
this
does
not
benefit
just
the
prisoner.
it
benefits
all
the
other
prisoners
who
live
in
this
closed
environment.
if
the
prison
officials
do
not
know
that
he
was
beaten
up
that
day,
they
have
no
opportunity
to
take
corrective
action
by
disciplining
the
particular
prison
guard.
it's
absolutely
vital
that
they
have
that
notice.
in
addition,
just
as
this
court
found
in
coit,
it's
very
efficient
and
useful
to
have
a
process
that
requires
claims
for
money
damages
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
agency
before
the
federal
action
is
filed
so
that
if
they
think
there
is
any
merit,
and
if
they
want
to
settle
the
claim,
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
15-day
deadline,
which
we
do
not
view
as
a
statute
of
limitations
in
any
sense...
it
is
simply
a
procedure
that
is
readily
waivable
both
by
the
bop
and
in
appropriate
cases
by
this
court...
serves
that
function.
the
15-day
deadline
isn't
to
erect
some
sort
of
barrier
for
inmates
with
meritorious
claims,
it's
to
protect
the
interest
that
the
system
was
established
for
in
the
first
place.
it
allows
for
very,
very
speedy
relief
which
helps
to
reduce
tensions.
it
also
helps
to
eliminate
the
harassment
suits
that
might
be
filed
if
the
prisoner
is
allowed
to
go
straight
to
court,
when
2
months
later
he
may
change
his
mind.
and
in
the
bureau's
experience
this
system,
including
that
15-day
deadline
has
been...
has
worked
very
well.
it
has
not
caused
forfeiture
of
rights
as
the
petitioner
would
suggest.
in
fact,
97
percent
of
all
of
the
grievances
filed
in
the
last
11
months...
and
i
think
there
were
some
9,000
of
them...
were
filed
within
the
15-day
period.
the
prisoners
know
how
to
comply
with
this
rule.
the
staff
helps
them.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
in
the
early
1970's,
i
believe
1974,
your
honor.
and
i
would
also
note
that
these
regulations,
including
the
15-day
deadline,
have
been
used
in
the
habeas
context
by
the
lower
federal
courts
and
they
have
required
that
this
regulatory
system
be
exhausted
before
filing
an
action
for
habeas
under
2241
regarding
conditions
of
confinement.
therefore,
in
other
words,
the
horrors
that
the
petitioner
is
talking
about,
these
artificial
barriers,
these
problems,
they
simply
have
not
come
up.
if
you
do
look
through
the
cases
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
you
will
not
find
any
significant
number
of
cases
dealing
with
whether
or
not
to
waive
the
15-day
deadline.
and
again,
without
that
system...
without
that
time
limit,
how
can
we
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
insure
that
this
process
will
be
quick
and
effective
so
that
if
they
then
want
to
file
a
judicial
action
at
the
conclusion--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
we
don't--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--they
do,
your
honor.
congress--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
reason
that
we
don't,
your
honor,
is
because
congress
established
the
procedure
for
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
for
the
federal
tort
claims
act
remedy.
and
it
did
that
with
all
federal
agencies
in
mind,
not
with
the
bureau
of
prisons
specifically
in
mind.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
in
most
cases,
inmates
who
want
to
pursue
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case
will
bring...
they
also
want
something
else,
too.
and
so
they
will
come
and
they
will
file
a
grievance.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
they
don't
have
to.
and
i
think
you're
right.
i
think
we
would
like
for
that
to
be
changed.
it
simply
is
a
consequence
of
having
a
system
that
was
designed--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
we
have
been...
as
i
say,
the
experience
has
been
that
these
claims
ordinarily
will
be
brought
to
us.
and
more
importantly,
your
honor,
i
would
also
note
that
while
the
system
is
different,
it
still
does
require
that
the
claim
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
before
it
could
be
filed
in
federal
court.
and
that
is
one
aspect
of
this
system
that
is
of
great
importance.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
again,
your
honor,
most
of
these
claims
such
as
this
one,
even
if
they
may
seek
an
ftca
remedy,
they
do
bring
them
under
this
system
as
well
in
order
to
try
and
obtain
some
other
kind
of
relief.
in
addition,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
thing
that
we
really
do
not
want
to
lose
sight
of
here
is
that
we
are
talking
about
a
system
that
has
been
designed
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
based
upon
its
experience
and
expertise
and
it
has
found
that
it
has
very,
very
substantial
benefits.
the
exhaustion
jurisprudence
of
this
court
suggests
that
it
is
entirely
appropriate,
even
if
full
relief
cannot
be
given
to
the
claimant,
that
exhaustion
be
required
in
order
to
accommodate
the
benefits
and
the
policies
of
the
agency
that
is
adversely
affected
when
exhaustion
is
not
required,
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
doesn't
even
contest
that
those
benefits
apply
here.
therefore,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
appropriate
to
defer
to
the
scheme
that's
been
established
by
the
bop,
and
if
there
are
problems
associated
with
a
meritorious
claim
where
an
inmate
believes
that
he
has
not
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
his
claim,
this
court
still
would
retain
equitable
jurisdiction
to
provide
relief
in
those
circumstances.
one
last
point
on
the
issue
of
the
ftca
remedy.
one
reason
why
in
the
bivens
context
it's
very
important
that
the
15-day
deadline
and
the
process
that's
been
established
here
be
exhausted
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
bivens
is
not
uniform.
and
in
some
jurisdictions
it
would
only
be
1
year.
and
therefore...
and
under
the
ftca
procedure
they
would
not
necessarily
exhaust
it
by
the
time
that
statute
of
limitations
would
run.
so
by
funneling
bivens...
potential
bivens
actions
through
the
administrative
grievance
procedure,
we
help
to
insure
the
protection
of
the
litigant's
rights
to
ultimately
bring
that
action,
even
in
the
states
that
have
the
shortest
known
statutes
of
limitations.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
