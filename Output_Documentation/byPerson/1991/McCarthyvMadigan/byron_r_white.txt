justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
you
bring
your
action
under
the
tort
claims
act?
you
didn't
think
you
could
win,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
now
about
the
torts
claim
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
what's
the
standard...
what
would
you
have
to
prove
to
win
under
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
the...
you
think
if
you
just
proved
negligence
in
this
case
you
could
win
on
your
tort
claims
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should...
if
there's
this
alternative
route
to
go,
why
would
we
put
up
with
a
bivens
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
suit
against
federal
prison
officials,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
standard
of
deliberate
indifference
would
be
close
enough
to
intentional
conduct
to
be
barred
by
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
swear
a
suit
against
state
prison
officials.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
a
federal
statute
about
exhaustion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
one
of
those
states?
you
have
to
exhaust
under
that
statute
even
though
there
isn't
a
damages
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
been
in
a
federal
prison?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
case
isn't
in
that
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
authority
does
the
bureau
of
prisons
have
to
provide
monetary
relief
under
this
particular
procedure
where
the
claim
is
not
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
what
authority...
where
does
it
get
the...
where
does
the
bop
get
the
authority
to
pay
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
this
is...
i
just
said,
what
authority
is
there
for
a
non-federal
tort
claims
act
to
give
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
say
that
what...
if
this
plaintiff
wants
to
prove
deliberate
indifference
he
might
be
able
to
get
much
more
money
than
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
so
it
would
not
be
a
federal
tort
claims
procedure.
