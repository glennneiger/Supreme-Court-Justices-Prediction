etowah.
justice
byron
r.
white
changing
an...
an
elective
office
to
an
appointive,
that
was...
that
was
a
square
holding
in
allen?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
we
got
any
cases
that
are
even
close
to
this,
in
your
favor?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
what
about
that...
wasn't
there
a
case
in
a
three-judge
court
where
there
was
a
transfer
of
authority
to
appoint
a
racing
commission
from
the
county's
legislative
delegation
to
the
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
connection
did
that
have
with
the
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
say
that...
that
case
was
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they...
they
seem
to
think
it
was
right,
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have,
they
certainly
have.
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yeah,
but
i
take
it
that
you...
you
seem
to
think
that
there
isn't
any
transfer,
just
pure
transfer
of
authority
that's
covered
by
section
5--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
respondent's
or
the
appellee's
position
here
really
requests
a
greater
relief
than
they
got
in
the
three-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
have
a
different...
they
have
a
different
and
broader
test
for
invalidation?
