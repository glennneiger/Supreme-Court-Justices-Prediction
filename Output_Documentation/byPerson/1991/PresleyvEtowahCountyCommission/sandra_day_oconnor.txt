justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
under
your
theory
any...
any
reduction
in
funding,
a
lesser
appropriation,
would
also
qualify
for
a
section
5
approval.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
from
what
you
say
it
would
seem
to
me
that
any
reduction
in
funding
of
a
particular
office
would
be
said
to
affect
voting
in
a
covered
jurisdiction,
and
yet
i...
it's
just
almost
inconceivable
to
think
of
the
flood
of
actions
that
would
have
to
be
reviewed
if
your
theory
is
correct,
that
that
also
constitutes
a
change
in
voting
practice
or
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
those
do
relate
to
voting,
of
course,
and
we're
getting
much
further
afield
when
we
talk
about
a
drop
in
funding
or
a
cut
in
the
budget
or
whatever.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
it
were
a
10
percent
budget
cut?
now,
presumably
that
has
to
be
precleared
as
well.
i
mean,
we're...
we're
told
that
the
significance
of
the
amount
or
the
change
is
not
important.
we
don't
look
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
and
presumably
on
your
theory
every
budget
change--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
you
have...
it's
a
60-day
waiting
period,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
have
a
natural
disaster
in
a
state,
and
the...
the
jurisdiction
has
to
transfer
money
from
some
agency
to
another
to
provide
for
emergency
relief...
let's
say
flood
relief...
but
can't
do
it
because
it
has
to
wait
60
days--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it's
a
budget
cut.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
mean
by
typically?
i
suppose
the
jurisdiction
has
to
know,
either
we
have
to
preclear
everything
or...
or
we
don't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
disagree
with
mr.
still
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--won't
that
pick
up
the
vast
bulk
of
legislative
enactments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
is
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
any
legislative
action
i've
ever
witnessed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
little
adjustments
here
and
there
of
the
authority
of
one
state
agency
or
another...
i
mean,
it
just
happens
day
in
and
day
out
with
most
pieces
of
legislation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
voting...
the
term
voting
in
the
statute
has
been
given
a
broad
definition,
mr.
smith.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the...
i
think
it's
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case
gives
a
few
examples
in
it
of
situations
which
might
be
said
to
be
in
this
category
of
cases--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
it
has
taken
action
and
where
it
has...
where
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
has
found
there
to
be
a
discriminatory
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
certainly
possible
that
in
a
covered
jurisdiction
that
if
a
black
person
is
elected
to
a
particular
office
that
with
the
intent
to
deprive
that
person
of
any
power
it
could
be
removed,
and
under
your
view,
then,
there
is
no
remedy.
