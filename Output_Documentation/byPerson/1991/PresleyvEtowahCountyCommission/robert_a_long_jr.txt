mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
minority
voters
elect
a
representative
of
their
choice
for
the
first
time
and
the
jurisdiction
responds
by
stripping
that
official
of
all
power,
then
the
minority
citizens'
vote
for
that
official
has
been
rendered
a
nullity,
in
the
language
of
42
u.s.c.
1973(c),
their
votes
are
not
effective,
so
we
do
think
that
a
transfer
of
decision
making
authority
to
or
from
an
elected
official
is
within
the
scope
of
section
5.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we
think
citizens
do
not
simply
cast
votes,
they
cast
votes
for
officials
who
will
make
decisions
of
government,
and...
and
a
view
of
voting
in
elections,
that
it
simply
involves
going
into
a
booth
and
casting
a
vote
is,
we
think,
much
too
narrow.
that's
the
view
that
obtained
in
the
old
communist
regimes,
where
everyone
participated
in
the
elections...
the
turnout
was
over
99
percent...
but
the
voting
meant
absolutely
nothing.
it
was
ineffective.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
if
they
were
both
elected,
and
if
it
were
a
transfer
of
decision
making
authority,
we
would
say
it
was
covered.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
distinction
we
draw
is
between
the
exercise
of
the
authority
to
decide
matters
of
government...
taxing,
spending,
substantive
policy...
and
the
transfer
of
those
decisions
from
one
official
to
another.
when
an
official
simply
exercises
that
authority,
it
is
not
subject
to
preclearance.
thus,
for
example,
we
do
not
think
that
budgets,
typically,
would
be
subject
to
preclearance,
and
nor
do
we
think
that
substantive
laws
would
typically
be
subject
to
preclearance.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
think
the
rule
would
be
something
very
close
to
no,
it
never
has
to
be
precleared.
in
the
etowah
county
case--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
we
disagree
on
that
point.
the
qualification,
i
would
add,
is
in
the
etowah
county
case
it
appears
there
may
have
been
a
practice
of
dividing
the
budget
into
equal
shares
and
if
that
practice
were
changed
we
would
say
that
is
a
transfer
of
decision
making
authority,
but
in
general
a
reduction
of
a
budget,
even
to
zero,
we
would
say
is
simply
the
exercise
of
the
authority
to
make
policy
and
doesn't
result--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--then
we
regard
that
as
the
exercise
of
the
authority
rather
than
a
transfer
of
the
authority
to
make
decisions.
we
think
that
that
distinction,
after
thinking
about
it
for
some
time,
is
the
one
that
best
effectuates
the
intent
of
congress
to
cover
all
changes
affecting
voting
with
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
in
our
view,
that
is
where
the
line--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--should
be
drawn,
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
there
is
a...
you
could
say
that
ultimately
all
power
is
delegated.
the
legislature
or
the
people,
if
it's
a
constitutional
amendment,
could
always
change
the
delegation.
we
would
say
that
where
an
official
has
authority
to
make
a
decision
that
then
takes
effect
without
further
action,
that
a
transfer
of
that
authority
is
subject
to
preclearance,
even
if
it's
possible
that
some
higher
body
could
countermand
that
decision
in
a
particular
case.
that
is
where
we
draw
that
line.
we
think,
again,
that
some
reallocations
of
authority
plainly
affect
the
power
of
a
citizen's
vote.
allen
held
that
a
change
making
an
elected
office
appointive
is
subject
to
preclearance,
and
we
think
the...
a
case
where
all
of
the
authority
of
an
elected
official
is
transferred
to
an
appointed
official
would
have
precisely
the
same
practical
effect,
so
we
think
that
at
least
that
case
must
be
covered
under
the
rationale
of
allen
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
a
diminution
in
the
effectiveness
of
a
vote
or
voting
power
is
covered,
and
we
also
think--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
was,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
we
also
think
that
less
drastic
changes
can
affect
the
power
of
a
citizen's
vote.
if,
for
example,
a
school
board
were
deprived
of
all
power
to
tax,
or
a
minority
representative
on
a
school
board
were
deprived
of
all
power
to
vote
on
matters
affecting
the
curriculum,
that
would
significantly
reduce
the
power
of
votes
for
the
school
board,
or
for
members
of
the
school
board.
we
think
that
excluding
all
transfers
of
authority...
all
transfers
of
authority
would
create
a
large
loophole
in
the
statute.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
intent
of
congress
to
combat
subtle
as
well
as
obvious
practices
that
abridge
voting
rights.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
any...
any
transfer
of
decision
making
authority,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
we
think
it's
settled
that
there
is
no
distinction
at
the
stage
of
whether
the
change
must
be
submitted
for
preclearance
for
minor
changes,
and
we
think
that
would
be
unworkable.
of
course,
at
the
second
stage
in
determining
whether
the
change
is
going
to
be
precleared,
that
would
be
taken
into
account,
and
we
would
also
take
into
account,
for
example,
that
the
change
was
between
officials
who
serve
the
same
constituency.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
the
line
we
draw,
justice
scalia.
again,
we
get
there
in
stages.
the
first
stage
of
our
analysis
is
that
we
think
some
of
these
changes
are
covered.
we
do
agree,
however,
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
every
legislative
enactment
has
to
be
submitted
for
preclearance
and
therefore,
in
deciding
where
to
draw
the
line,
we
think
the
line
that
is
most
faithful
to
the
intent
of
congress...
although
it
will
produce
some
borderline
cases...
is
to
require
that
all
changes
in
decision
making
power
be
submitted
for
preclearance.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no.
we
think
it
will--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we
think,
justice--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we
think
the
transfers
of
decision
making
authority
are
not
an
everyday
occurrence,
and
that
officials
are
generally
quite
reluctant
to
give
up
authority,
and
that
this
would
cover
far
less
than
the
huge
expansion
of
the
scope
of
section
5
that
appellees
suggest,
and
i
also
want
to
note
that
the
preclearance
process
is
set
up
to
process
a
large
number
of
changes.
we
precleared
almost
17,000
changes
last
year
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
do
not.
i
know
that
a
number
have--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
know
that
we
have
objected
on
eight
occasions.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
there
have,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
in
this
fiscal
year
we
approved
all
but
121
of
those
17,000,
so
well
over
99
percent.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
finally,
we
would
disagree
with
appellees
that
our
test
is
unworkable
in
practice.
we
think
that
many
transfers
of
authority
will
have
no
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect,
and
where
there
is
some
effect
we
would
look
to
this
court's
statement
last
term
in
houston
lawyers
association
that
a
covered
jurisdiction's
legitimate
policy
reasons
for
a
change
are
properly
weighed
in
making
the
preclearance
determination.
so
again,
our
position
is
that
some
of
these
changes
clearly
do
have
a
potential...
a
serious
potential...
to
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
votes,
and
we
think
some
of
them
must
be
covered
and
the
line
that
we
urge
the
court
to
draw
is
between
changes
that
affect
the
decision
making
power
of
elected
officials,
which
we
think
are
covered...
all
of
them
are
covered...
and
other
changes,
the
exercise
of
decision
making
power,
which
we
think
are
not
covered.
thank
you.
