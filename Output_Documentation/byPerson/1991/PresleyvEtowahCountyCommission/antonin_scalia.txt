justice
antonin
scalia
well,
regardless
of
what
it's
supposed
to
do,
what
it
says
is
that
you
have
to
clear
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
or
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting,
so
what
your
burden
is,
in
this
case,
is
to
say
that
changing
the
responsibilities
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
county's
officership
is
a
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
or
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
now,
you
can
go
under
section
2,
if
it
was
done
for
a
discriminatory
motive,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
talking
about
going
under
section
5
and
requiring
it
to
be
precleared
as
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
i
must
say,
i
would
never
in
my
wildest
dream
imagine
that
that
qualified
under
that
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
all
changes,
only
a
change
of
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
necessary
to
make
the
vote
effective?
no,
indeed.
my
vote
is
just
as
effective.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say...
you're
saying
my
vote
becomes
less
effective
somehow
when...
when
the
congress
takes
away
some
powers
that
the
president
had
before,
that
they...
they
have
made
my
vote
less
effective?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
there
has
been
a
change,
and
i
understand
that
the
change
may
well
have
a
discriminatory
motivation,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
is
a
change
with
respect
to
voting.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
also
changed
who
you
voted
for.
i
mean,
all
the
other
examples
you
mentioned
actually
concerned
the
voting
process...
the
place
of
voting,
and
so
forth.
that
last
one
didn't
relate
to
the...
to
the
process
of
voting
but
it
did
relate
to
who
you
voted
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
proposing
now
is
going
yet
another
step
that
neither
relates
to
the
manner
of
voting
or
to
who
you
voted
for,
but
to
the
powers
of
the
person
for
whom
you
voted.
you'll
keep
voting
for
the
same
person,
but
he's
going
to
have
different
powers.
i
mean,
once
you...
once
you
take
that
last
step,
it
seems
to
me
there's...
there's
no
end
of
what
has
to
be
submitted
for
clearance.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
the
touchstone
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
says,
with
respect
to
voting.
isn't
that
the
touchstone?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
freewheeling
inquiry
into...
into
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
their
votes
are
effective.
they
voted
for
this
person.
that
person
is
in
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we're
not
dealing
with
poetry
here.
we're
dealing
with
a...
with
a
statute.
are
their
votes
rendered
ineffective?
they're
not
rendered
ineffective.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that...
why
is
it
different
if
you
do
it
through
the
budget
than
if
you
do
it
through
reassigning
functions?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
principle,
why
is
it
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
take
all
authority
from
you
and
give
it
to
another
officer,
that
affects
voting--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
if
i
take
all
the
money
at
your
disposal
and
give
it
to
another
officer,
that
doesn't
affect
voting.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
any
transfer
of
authority
count?
what...
you
know,
what
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
matter
how
minor
the
issue
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
once
again,
i
could
take
away
all
of
the
official's
money,
so
that
effectively
he
has
no
more
power,
but
if
i
take
away
one
iota
of
his
theoretical
authority,
then
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
assumed
that
they
were
as
categorical
as
you
said,
and
i
had
assumed
that
the
reason
they
were
was
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
vagueness
at
all
in
the
test,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court,
not
by
some
court
of
appeals,
because
it'll
come
out
of
a
three-judge
court
and
come
here
as
an
appeal,
just
as
this
one
is,
so
the
test
has
to
be
very,
very
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
i...
and
i
guess
the
attorney
general
cannot
clear
it
if...
if
it
does
fail
the
effects
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
racist...
racial
motives
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
the
justice
department
would
have
to
invalidate
not
only
those
that
have
racist
motives
but
those
that
have
racist
effects,
whether
or
not
they
have
racist
motives.
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
they
just
take
power
from
a
black
electorate
and
give
it
to
a
white
one.
