justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
how
many
of
those
involved
transfers
of
decision
making
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
any
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
have
been
requests
for
preclearance
in
situations
involving
transfers
of
authority,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
section
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you...
in
your
view,
does
section
2
apply
to
this
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
transfer
of
power
just
before
the
election?
in
other
words,
say
you
agree
on
this
redistricting
and
the
consent
decree,
and
then,
in
advance
of
the
election,
you
take
away
the
power
of
the
person
that's
likely
to
be
elected
from
the
two
new
black
districts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that
would
have
any
effect
on
what
happens
on
election
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that's
all
that
different
from
changing
electoral
boundaries,
which
one
can
argue
very
forcefully
congress
never
thought
of
either
at
the
time
the
statute
was
pending.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
does
affect
who
votes.
who
votes...
it
affects
the
district
in
which
you
vote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
because
the...
the
deferring
to
the
officer
who's
supposed
to
interpret
this
statute
for
us,
he
says
you
can
draw
a
meaningful
line
between
budget
changes
and
reallocations
of
power,
and
implicitly
he's
suggesting
that
maybe
there
aren't
as...
the
millions
of
these
problems
out
there
that
your
brief
suggests,
and
i
thought
you're
probably
right.
maybe
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
these.
but
how
do
we
know
how
often
there
are
transfers
of
power
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand
them
to
be
going
that
far.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
does
if
you
accept...
if
you
include
all
the
budget
changes
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
i
don't
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
be
saying
those
are
included.
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
him,
and
i
know
logically...
i
understand
the
logic
of
the
argument.
often
we...
you
know,
we
draw
arbitrary
lines,
and
that's
what
he's
saying.
there's
kind
of
an
arbitrary
line,
here.
it
has
to
be
a
transfer
of
power,
sort
of,
that
you
can
look
at
it
and
say,
this
decision
used
to
be
made
by
mr.
a
and
it's
now
going
to
be
made
by
mr.
b.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
in
this
particular
case,
under
your
view,
what
should
be
done
as
to
the
other...
the
two...
two
unprecleared
resolutions,
one
by
each
county?
do
you
think
they
should
go
back
for
trial
on
the
constitutional
issue?
is
that
what
happens?
