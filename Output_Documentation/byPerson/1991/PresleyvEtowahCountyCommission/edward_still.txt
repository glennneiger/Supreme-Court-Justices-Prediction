mr.
edward
still
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question,
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
whether
a
county
must
submit
for
preclearance
a
transfer
of
power
away
from
an
individual
county
commissioner
to
either
a
white
majority
county
commission
or
an
official
appointed
by
that
county
commission.
we
contend
that
these
changes
must
be
submitted,
because
they
affect
the
power
of
voters
to
elect
commissioners
who
can
respond
to
citizens'
wishes.
in
etowah
county,
this
transfer
occurred
immediately
after
the
election
of
lawrence
presley,
the
first
black
county
commissioner
in
the
county's
history,
and
therefore
diminished
the
power
of
that
black
county
commissioner.
this,
in
turn,
affected
the
power
of
the
black
voters
in
his
district
to
control
roadwork
in
their
particular
district.
in
the
south,
roads
have
traditionally
been
the
main
concern
of
county
commissions.
the
road
commissioner's
responsiveness
to
his
constituents
is
judged
by
how
well
he
handles
their
complaints
and
concerns
about
the
roadwork.
mr.
edward
still
no,
sir,
they
are
not.
mr.
edward
still
on
the
eastern
border,
yes,
sir.
one
of
them
is
phenix
city
and
the
other
is
gadsden.
if
you
look
on
a
map,
that's
the
easy
way
to
find
them.
mr.
edward
still
yes,
sir.
it...
it's
an
old
indian
name,
and
it
gets
mispronounced
quite
often.
mr.
edward
still
etowah.
mr.
edward
still
the--
mr.
edward
still
--i
have
no
idea.
when
the
etowah
county
commission
transferred
the
power
to
control
roadwork
from
the
individual
county
commissioners
to
the
whole
commission,
it
assured
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
the
white
voters
in
commissioner
presley's
district
would
not
have
to
go
to
a
black
official
to
talk
about
their
problems,
and
secondly
that
black
voters
would
still
have
to
come
to
white
officials...
in
this
case
a
commission
with
a
white
majority...
to
talk
about
their
roads.
mr.
edward
still
it
took
a
majority
of
the
six
members,
and
so
it
would
have
taken
four
votes,
or
the
chairman
could
have
broken
a
tie
of
three,
i
believe.
mr.
edward
still
there's
a
total
of
six,
but
there's
a
seventh
member
who
is
a
nonvoting
chairman,
and
i
believe
he
has
a
tiebreaking
power,
so
if
they
tie
3
to
3--
mr.
edward
still
--that's
correct,
it
would
be.
in
russell
county,
the...
the
transfer
of
power
occurred
before
blacks
were
elected,
but
in
this
case
the
county
is
roughly
40
percent
black.
in
1979,
when
the
county
adopted
what's
called
the
county
unit
system,
which
allows
the
county
engineer
to
control
all
the
roadwork
as
an
entire
unit
in
the
county.
several
nearby
jurisdictions
in
alabama
had
already
been
forced
to
go
to
single-member
districts
and
had
elected
blacks.
the
handwriting
was
on
the
wall
that
single-member
districts
and
black
elected
officials
were
coming
to
russell
county.
mr.
edward
still
i
believe
he's
a
civil
service
employee,
sir.
they'd
have
to
have
cause,
but
they
can
fire
him
in
that
sense.
as
this
court
unanimously
found
in
hunter
v.
underwood,
the
president
of
the
1901
alabama
constitutional
convention
said
the
purpose
of
that
convention
was
to
establish
white
supremacy
in
this
state.
we
believe
these
changes
perpetuate
a
kind
of
white
supremacy
which
prevents
blacks
from
having
any
real
power
over
white
constituents.
these
changes
are
exactly
the
type
that
congress
intended
to
cover
when
it
passed
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
to
understand
section
5,
we
think
you've
got
to
understand
the
circumstances
that
led
to
its
passage.
this
court
in
1965
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
described
the
situation.
the
southern
states
had
resorted
to
the
extraordinary
stratagem
of
contriving
new
rules
of
various
kinds
for
the
sole
purpose
of
perpetuating
black
political
powerlessness
in
the
face
of
adverse
federal
court
decrees.
congress
had
reason
to
suppose
that
these
states
might
try
similar
maneuvers
in
the
future
in
order
to
evade
the
remedies
contained
in
the
voting
rights
act
itself,
so
congress
passed
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
make
sure
that
these
sorts
of
changes
wouldn't
continue
to
be
brought
along
every
time
some
stratagem
was
knocked
down.
section
5
is
supposed
to
change
the
balance
of
power.
it's
supposed
to
put--
mr.
edward
still
--that's
correct,
but
section
5--
mr.
edward
still
--well,
section
5
was
designed
to
get
at
new
changes
that
were
made
to
stop
those
new
discriminatory
changes
from
being
made,
and
section
2
was
designed
to
get
at
those
that
happened
to
slip
by
that
and
the
preexisting
ones.
mr.
edward
still
that's
correct,
and
section
14
defines
voting
as...
as
encompassing
all
those
things
necessary
to
make
the
vote
effective,
and
one
of
the
things
necessary
to
make
the
vote
effective
is
that
when
you
elect
a
representative
or
a
county
commissioner,
he
be
able
to
do
something...
have
some
power
to
do
something.
mr.
edward
still
but
the
vote
is
effective--
mr.
edward
still
--in...
in
terms
of
electing
the
president,
but
in
this...
in
this
sense
we're
talking
about
a
county
commissioner,
and
if
once
blacks
get
the
vote
and
get
single-member
districts
so
they
can
elect
county
commissioners
of
their
choice,
then
they
find
that
those
county
commissioners
can't
do
anything
for
them,
they've
had
the
value
of
their
vote
affected.
mr.
edward
still
because
i
think
if
it's...
if
it's
covered
by
section
2
it
could
just
as
well
be
covered
by
section
5,
if
it's
a
change
since
1964.
both
of
them
are
part
of
the
voting
rights
act.
both
of
them
use
the
same
definition
of
voting.
if
it
affects
voting,
and
it
affects
something
necessary
to
make
the
vote
effective,
then
it
affects
the
right
to
vote
under
section
14
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
edward
still
some
reductions
in
funding
might
be
covered
by
section
5
if
they
have...
if
they
affect
voting,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
you
can
draw
a
line
there.
mr.
edward
still
well,
congress
defined
voting
in
a
very
broad
way
here,
because
they
had
seen
that
the
south
and
other
covered
jurisdictions
had
continued
to
use
various
sorts
of
stratagems.
if
the
white
primary
was
declared
unconstitutional,
they
adopted
a
new
property
requirement
or
a
new
literacy
test,
so
that
there
was
always
something
else,
and
in
order--
mr.
edward
still
--well,
etowah
county,
for
instance,
in
their
brief
in
this
case
argued
that
it
would
be
pointless
to
require
this
to
be
precleared
because
the
state
could
always
achieve
the
same
result
some
other
way,
and
our
point
is
that
section
5
is
written
in
a
broad
way,
with...
especially
with
the
definition
found
in
section
14,
that
is
designed
to
get
at
changes
which
have
a
discriminatory
impact
on
the...
the
rights
of
people
to
vote,
to
have
their
vote
counted
effectively.
i
think
you...
i
think
in
any
case
involving
a
budget
you'd
probably
have
to
look
at
a
lot
of
different
circumstances
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
had
an
effect
on
the...
the
electoral
power
on
the
people
eventually,
or
whether
it
was
just
sort
of
a
routine
change
in
a
budget.
a
budget...
a
new
budget
is
adopted
every
year.
mr.
edward
still
that's
correct.
if
you
can--
mr.
edward
still
--well,
i
would
suggest
not
every
time
you
cut
a...
cut
a
budget.
for
instance--
mr.
edward
still
--you
might
have
a
general
retrenchment,
everybody
gets
a
10
percent
across
the
board
cut,
and
this
particular
official
gets
a
10
percent
cut
as
well.
that's
a
decrease
in
the
budget,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
affect
his
electoral
power.
but
if
you
took
the
example...
if
you
took
the
example
that
the
sheriff's
budget
had
always
been
$
10,
000,
000
in
a
particular
county,
and
suddenly,
just
as
soon
as
a
black
got
elected,
they
cut
the
sheriff's
budget
to
$1,
000,
000
and
said
well,
you've
just
got
to
make
up
the
rest
someplace
else,
now
that
would
be
the
kind
of
change
that
certainly
would
have
to
be
precleared,
and
i
would
suggest
for
that
reason
we
can't
draw
the
line
and
say,
oh,
well,
budgets...
we're
never
going
look
at
budgets,
because
if
you
say,
we're
never
going
to
look
at
budgets--
mr.
edward
still
--then
all
budgets
should
probably
have
to
be
precleared,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
only
the
ones
which
have
an
effect
on
voting,
and
we
have
to
keep
going
back
to
whether
it
has
an
effect
on
voting,
are
the
ones
that
are
going
to...
that
are
going
to
be
submitted.
if
it
doesn't
affect--
mr.
edward
still
--i
was
suggesting
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
it
would
affect
the
electoral
power
of
the
citizens,
of
the
voters,
and
so
therefore
that
change
certainly
would
have
to
be
precleared,
and
for
that
reason
i
don't
think
that
we
can
exclude
the
class
of
events
called
budget
adoption
from
coverage
of
section
5,
but
it
only
has
to
be
precleared
if
it
affects
voting--
mr.
edward
still
--so
we
can...
i
think
we
can
say
that
here's
a
class
of
event,
sometimes
it
affects
voting
and
sometimes
don't--
mr.
edward
still
--but
we
can't
say
that
it
never
did.
mr.
edward
still
it
affects
voting
when...
i
gave
as...
as
a
hypothetical
when
a
newly-elected
black
sheriff
finds
his
budget
cut
by
90
percent,
and
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
fairly
clear.
mr.
edward
still
that's
correct,
because
in
that
kind
of
situation--
mr.
edward
still
--well,
i
think
what
you've
got
to
look
at
is
if
there
was
a
10
percent
change.
first
of
all,
the
jurisdiction
has
two
burdens
here.
they
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
purpose,
there's
no
intent
to
discriminate,
and
secondly
that
it
will
not
have
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
people
on
the
basis
of
their
race,
so
it
could
be
that
a
10
percent
cut
was
carried
out
for
a
racial
intent
because
there's
a
black
sheriff
that's
just
been
elected.
mr.
edward
still
well,
i
would
suggest
that
we...
we
should
look
also
at
what
sort
of...
what
sort
of
actions
the
jurisdiction
takes
to
make
the
submission.
they
make
a
submission
by
writing
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
the
attorney
general
writes
a
letter
back
saying,
i
interpose
no
objection.
in
between--
mr.
edward
still
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
still
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have--
mr.
edward
still
--the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
to
take
60
days.
he
took
36
hours,
i
think
it
was,
with
new
york
city's
districting
plan
that
was
adopted
this
summer
or
last
spring.
mr.
edward
still
i
suggest
that
if--
mr.
edward
still
--i
think
that...
i
think
what
we
would
have
to
say
is
that
you
could
not
exclude
budgets
from
the
type
of
things
that
have
to
be
submitted
for
preclearance,
and
so
if
they...
if
a
budget
in
a
particular
case--
mr.
edward
still
--that's
right,
you
must
include
them.
the
district
court
in
this
particular
case
used
the...
this
court's
potential
for
discrimination
test
to
create
exemptions
from
section
5
coverage.
specifically,
in
etowah
county
they
held
that
the
reallocation
of
authority
that
was
embodied
in
the
common
fund
resolution
was
in
practical
terms
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
entire
commission's
authority
both
before
and
after
the
disputed
change
to
allocate
funds
among
the
various
districts,
but
the
category
of
things
being
insignificant
or
small
changes
has
never
before
been
seen
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
insignificant
or
small
changes
still
have
the
potential
for
discrimination.
for
instance,
the
transfer
of
a
polling
place
in
perkins
v.
matthews
has
the
potential
for...
for
discrimination,
and
it
has
to
be
precleared
whether
the
polling
place
is
being
moved
across
the
street
or
to
the
other
side
of
the
district.
in
dougherty
county
v.
white,
there
were
changes
in
personnel
regulations
that
affected
candidates.
in
city
of
lockhart
v.
the
united
states,
the
change
was
the
change
in
the
number
of
the
members
of
the
governing
body
of
the
city
from
three
to
five,
and
this
court
held,
well,
that
was
changing
the
amount
of
power
each
individual
member
of
that
body
held,
and
in
city
of
pleasant
grove
v.
united
states--
mr.
edward
still
--it
did--
mr.
edward
still
--well,
i
think
we
still
have
got
to
look
at
the...
at
the
touchstone
here
of
the
potential
for
discrimination.
in--
mr.
edward
still
--yes,
it
should
be,
and
the...
and
the
way
in
which--
mr.
edward
still
--it...
if
it
affects...
if
it
affects
voting,
then
it
is
covered
by
the
statute,
and
the
gloss
that
this
court
has
put
on
it
is
things
which
have
the
potential
for
discrimination,
and
for
instance,
in
pleasant
grove
you
were
dealing
with
a
situation
where
it
was
expanding
the
city
limits
to
include
uninhabited
territory.
nobody
was
going
to
vote,
necessarily.
it
might
be
for
ever
and
ever
into
the
future,
no
one
was
going
to
vote.
so
the
change
there
was
about
the
potential
for
discrimination.
i
would
ask
the
court...
if
it
please
the
court
i
would
ask
that
the
rest
of
my
time
be
reserved
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
still
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
position
of
the
appellees
is
much
more
radical
than
the
position
of
the
district
court
below,
because
the
district
court
below
held
that
we
still
had
viable
section
2
claims.
take
a
look
at
footnote
21
of
the
district
court
opinion.
they
said
we
can
still
go
back
and
try
our
section
2
claims.
they
were
not
ruling
those
out,
so
they
were
still
saying
these
things
may
affect
voting,
and
by
us
holding
against
you
on
section
5,
we're
not
holding
that
they
don't
affect
voting,
we're
just
saying
they're
insignificant,
or
you
didn't
meet
the
change
in
constituency
rule
that
we
have
now
engrafted
onto
section
5,
but
as
we've
all,
i
think,
agreed
here
today,
section
2
and
section
5
establish
essentially
congruent
standards.
they
cover
the
same
territory.
one
of
them
is
designed
to...
to
stop
things
as
they
get
passed,
and
the
other
one
is
designed
to
catch
those
things
that
get
through
and
those
things
that
pass
before
the
1965
voting
rights
act
was
passed.
this
is
not
a
budget
case.
we've
spent
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
budgets.
this
is
a
case
about
the
transfer
of
power.
voters
used--
mr.
edward
still
--to
the
extent
that
they
suggest
and...
and
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
we
no
longer
have
a
section
2
claim
if
we
don't
have
a
section
5
claim,
then
they're
getting
more
than
they
had
in
the
court
below,
and
they
did
file--
mr.
edward
still
--that's
right,
but
they...
but
they're
asking
for
greater
relief
than
they
got,
and
they're
not...
they
didn't
file
an
appeal.
i
appreciate
the
court's
time.
thank
you.
