we'll
hear
argument
next
in
90-711,
lawrence
presley
v.
etowah
county
commission,
peter
mack
v.
russell
county
commission.
mr.
still.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
almost
backwards,
isn't
it?
i
thought
what
you
were
saying
was
that
any
time
a
budget
cut
affects
the
power
of
an
elected
office,
then
the
budget
cut
has
an
effect
on
voting.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
it
affects--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
affects
voting
when?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that...
that's
because
the
people
who
voted
to
elect
that
sheriff
are
now
getting
a
sheriff
who
has
less...
less
money
to
fund
his
office
than
the...
presumably
the
white
sheriff
who
was
there
before.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
still.
mr.
long,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
rule,
i
take
it,
would
apply
to
statewide
offices,
too,
if
one
responsibility
were
shifted
to
the
treasurer
to
the
auditor,
saying
they
were
both
elected
officials?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you...
how
do
you
define
decision
making
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
smith,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
still,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
still.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-711,
presley
versus
etowah
county
commission
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
