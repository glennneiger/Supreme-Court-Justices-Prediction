justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me,
how
many
votes
did
it
take
to
pass
the
common
fund
resolution
in
etowah
county?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
a
total
of
six?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
then
i
take
it
the
same
answer
to
repeal
the
resolution...
same
vote.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
board
fire
the
engineer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
this--
--but
isn't
your
test
that
if
you
can
imagine
a
set
of
circumstances
in
which
it
would
be
racially
discriminatory
then
there
has
to
be
preclearance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
any
time
you
cut
an
executive's
budget,
he
has
less
authority,
so
any
budget-cutting
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but...
but
your
test
is,
then
you
have
to
look
at
all
budgets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
still
haven't,
at
least
to
my
satisfaction,
answered
the
question
of
what
is
your
test
for
budget
submissions,
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests,
every
budget
cut
has
to
be
submitted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
you're
going
to
say,
well,
the
attorney
general
might,
because
of
a
change
of
letters,
quickly
approve
it,
but
the
point
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
statutory
requirement
for
preclearance,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
answer
the
question
yes,
based
on
your
theory
of
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
mind
if
i
rephrase
that
as
saying
that
you
must
include
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
in
etowah
county
if
the
budget
was
divided
among
four
people
and
then
they
change
and
it's
a
common
fund,
in
both
instances
it
was
under
the
total
control
of
the
commission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
so
i
don't
see
how
there's
a
transfer
of
power,
even
under
your
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
how
many
of
the
requests
were
denied?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
and
i
take
it
that
if
blacks
have
been
newly
enfranchised
at
the
local
level,
that
would
prevent
transfers
away
from
the
local
government,
but
then
if
they
make
certain
gains
in
the
state
legislature
it
would
work
the
other
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
two
suits
under
section
5
of
the
voting
ranks
act
were
commenced
in
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama,
and
the
consolidated
cases
are
now
here
on
appeal.
each
suit
concerns
a
county
road
commission
in
rural
alabama,
one
in
etowah
county
and
the
other
in
russell
county.
the
commission
members
are
elected.
in
each
of
these
counties,
there
was
litigation
to
change
the
electoral
process.
and
as
a
result,
the
first
black
members
in
modern
times
were
elected
to
the
road
commissions
in
1986.
those
electoral
changes
are
not
at
issue
here.
instead,
the
suits
challenge
changes
in
the
decision
making
authority
and
the
decision
structure
of
the
commissions.
the
black
commission
members
who
brought
these
suits
claim
that
these
changes
had
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
rule
and
the
real
power
of
the
elected
members.
in
etowah
county,
the
commission
altered
its
prior
practice
of
delegating
to
each
member
of
the
commission
the
authority
to
determine
how
funds
allocated
to
his
particular
road
district
should
be
spent.
and
under
the
new
system,
decisions
of
this
sort
are
made
by
the
commission
as
a
whole.
in
russell
county,
the
commission
altered
its
earlier
practice
of
granting
the
commissioner's
individual
authority
for
road
and
bridge
repair
and
construction
within
their
separate
residency
districts.
under
the
new
system
in
russell
county,
these
responsibilities
were
transferred
to
the
county
engineer.
he
was
an
official
appointed
by
the
commission
and
responsible
to
it,
but
he
made
all
of
the
routine
decisions
respecting
construction
and
road
repair
countywide.
the
plaintiffs
sued
the
county
commissions
to
enjoin
these
changes
on
the
basis
that
they
were
covered
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
act
provides,
in
covered
jurisdictions,
that
any
change
with
respect
to
voting
must
be
submitted
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
for
approval
before
it
may
be
implemented.
these
changes
had
not
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
county
commissions
could
implement
the
changes
because
they
were
not
covered
by
the
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
though
we
adapt
a
different
rationale
to
determine
the
question,
what
constitutes
a
change
with
respect
to
voting
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
act?
the
commissioners
who
sue
argue
that
these
changes
in
decision
making
structure
reduced
their
net
authority.
it
follows,
they
contend,
that
a
vote
cast
for
individual
commissioners
was
made
less
valuable
and
so
there
was
a
change
with
respect
to
voting.
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
agrees.
it
asks
us
to
adapt
a
rule
embracing
the
routine
actions
of
state
and
local
governments
at
all
levels
so
that
this
case
has
significance
well
beyond
these
two
county
commissions.
we
reject
the
position
of
the
appellants
and
of
the
united
states
because
it
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
provides
no
workable
standard.
were
we
to
accept
the
appellant's
reading
of
section
5,
we
would
work
an
unconstrained
expansion
of
the
statutory
coverage.
innumerable
state
and
local
enactments
having
nothing
to
do
with
voting,
affects
the
power
of
elected
officials.
the
appellants
and
the
united
states
failed
to
provide
a
workable
distinction
between
changes
in
rules
governing
voting
and
changes
in
the
routine
organization
and
functioning
of
government.
some
standard
is
necessary
for
in
a
real
sense,
every
decision
taken
by
a
democratic
government
implicates
voting.
yet,
no
one
would
contend
that
when
congress
enacted
the
voting
rights
act
it
meant
to
subject
all
or
even
most
decisions
of
government
in
covered
jurisdictions
to
federal
supervision.
rather,
the
act
by
its
terms
covers
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting,
or
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
the
changes
now
at
issue
are
not
covered
by
this
language.
and
on
this
rationale,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
white
and
blackmun
join.
