mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
applies
to
all
changes
in
election
laws
or
practices
but
does
not
apply
to
transfers
of
power
or
function
among
elected
officials.
now
in
drawing
this
line,
i
fully
acknowledge
that
transfers
of
authority
among
officials
can
be
undertaken
for
discriminatory
reasons
and
can,
in
practice,
affect
the
ability
of
minority
citizens
in
a
particular
district
or
locale
to
influence
the
course
of
public
policy.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
your
honor.
dougherty
county
was
a
case
about
a
specific
rule
which
was
enacted
which--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
the
dissent
there
dealt
with
whether
this
thing
was
closely
enough
related
to
election
laws.
it
was
a
rule
which
specifically
focused
on
what
happens
to
somebody
who
runs
for
office.
justice
powell
in
his
dissent
there
indicated
he
thought
it
wasn't
a
change
in
election
laws
because
it
was
a
rule
that
was
passed
through
a
personnel
aspect
of
a
school
board,
but
since
it
was
a
rule
that
said,
here's
what
happens
to
you
when
you
run
for
office,
it's
certainly
consistent
with
the
line
i've
drawn
to
say
dougherty
county
affects
voting,
but
transfers
of
authority
don't
affect
voting.
transfers
of
authority
instead,
we
believe,
should
be
governed
not
by
section
5
with
its
particular
standards
and
procedures
but
by
the
conventional
remedies
for
other
kinds
of
discrimination,
if
they
are
discriminatory,
which
is
suits
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
section
5
doesn't
apply
to
something,
then
it's
pretty
clear
that
section
2
doesn't
apply.
they
have
the
identical
language...
standards,
practices
and
procedures
with
respect
to
voting.
now,
in
section
5,
what
congress
created
was
a
unique
form
of
federal
administrative
review
of
state
and
local
laws
with
an
unusually
stringent
substantive
test,
and
i
think
it's
this
test
that's
kind
of
gotten
lost
in
this
case.
it
certainly
isn't
addressed
by
any
of
the
parties
on
the
other
side.
that
test
is
an
effects
test
which
says
that
any
retrogressive
impact
caused
by
a
change...
impact
on
the
position
of
minorities
in
the
community
and
their
political
power...
is
enough
to
invalidate
the
change.
now,
that's
pretty
strong
medicine
when
we
have
federal
administrators
applying
a
test
of
that
sort,
but
what
congress
says
is
we're
going
to
have
this
kind
of
mechanism,
but
it's
going
to
apply
only
to
a
particular
discrete
category
of
changes...
changes
in
the
way
elections
are
conducted,
things
that
happen
on
election
day.
that,
after
all,
is
what
the
statute
says.
it
says,
standards,
practices
and
procedures
with
respect
to
voting,
it
doesn't
say,
anything
that
affects
power
in
the
government,
and
this
limitation
is
perfectly
sensible
if
you
look
back
at
what
it
was
that
led
congress
to
single
out
a
minority
of
political
jurisdictions
in
this
country
and
subject
them
to
special
regulation.
these
were
jurisdictions
which
back
in
the
'60's
had
large
numbers
of
minority
residents
who
weren't
registered
to
vote,
so
the
problem
that
existed
was
one
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
elections
and
voting,
and
congress
addressed
that
problem
in
two
ways
in
the
voting
rights
act
in
1965.
first,
for
these
specific
jurisdictions
it
suspended
all
literacy
tests
and
other
devices
that
were
preventing
people
from
registering
to
vote,
and
then
in
section
5
what
it
did
is
it
essentially
froze
in
place
the
balance
of
the
electoral
system
that
those
jurisdictions
had.
it
said,
you...
we're
going
to
take
away
your
literacy
tests
and
other
devices,
and
the
rest
of
the
stuff
has
to
stay
the
same,
with
one
proviso,
which
was
if
the
jurisdiction
could
come
forward
and
affirmatively
prove
that
there...
that
a
change
would
be
at
least
neutral
in
its
impact
on
the
political
influence
of
minorities,
then
that
change
could
go
forward.
now,
nothing
in
that
sequence
of
events,
and
nothing
in
the
actual
legislative
record,
not
one
word
cited
by
anybody
here,
suggests
that
congress
intended
this...
this
freezing
effect
and
this
drastic
kind
of
federal
administrative
review
to
extend
beyond
things
that
directly
relate
to
what
happens
in
elections.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
there's
only
two
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
that
have
ever
been
filed
that
didn't
involve
something
that
related
to
elections,
this
case
and
the
case
of
hardy
v.
wallace,
which
was
a
district
court
case
in
which
they
said
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
thing
that's
remarkable
about
this
case
is
that
we're
talking
about
a
vast
expansion
of
a
statute
26
years
after
it
was
passed.
if
this
was
what
everybody
understood
the
voting
rights
act
to
apply
to,
you
would
expect
that
there
would
have
been
thousands
of
lawsuits
filed
by
plaintiffs
over
the
past
26
years.
certainly
it's
clear
that,
looking
at
the
kinds
of
definitions
of
what
has
to
be
precleared
that
we're
being
given
here,
that
there
have
been
tens
and
tens
of
thousands
of
violations
of
this
statute
every
year
since
1965
in
covered
jurisdictions.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
i...
and
i
certainly
am
not
asking
the
court
to
cut
back
in
that
definition,
the
definition
that
started
in
allen,
but
what
that
definition
says
is
you
look
at
who
can
vote,
who's
voting
with
them
in
the
voter
pool,
who's
on
the
ballot,
what...
where
they
vote,
the
terms
of
office
of
people,
so
that
affects
when
they
vote.
but
there
has
to
be
some
concrete
connection
to
the
events
of
election
day,
i
submit,
and
that's
certainly
what
this
court
held
in
allen,
and
there's
never
been
anything
in
the
governing
regulations
or
the
legislative
history,
nothing
that
suggests
otherwise.
indeed,
it's
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
attorney
general
now
for
26
years
has
not
come
out
with
a
regulation
that
lists
anything
as...
as
covered
by
the
preclearance
mechanism
which
doesn't
involve
elections.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
there
are
several
examples
cited.
i
think
the
total
amounts
to
something
like
8
or
10
over
the
past
26
years
that
they
were
able
to
find
where
they
found
an
illegal
transfer
of
power.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no.
there
are
plenty
of
remedies,
your
honor.
the
remedy
is
a
lawsuit
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
is
the
remedy
that
you
apply
for
discrimination
by
government
in
every
other
context.
for
example,
if
government
decides
we're
not
going
to
give
public
services
to
this
segment
of
the
community
because
the
people
who
live
there
are
black,
the
remedy
is
a
lawsuit
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
same
would
be
true
here
if,
with
racist
intent,
a
group
of
people
take
power
away
from
somebody
who
is
elected
by
black
constituents,
or
because
he's
black.
there
are
remedies
out
there.
the
question
is,
is
transfer
of...
is
a
transfer
of
authority
sufficiently
part
and
parcel
of
the
electoral
process
so
that
it
fits
over
into
this
narrow
box
of
one
type
of
discrimination
that's
covered
by
section
5?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that
was
the
case
i
cited
to
you
a
moment
ago,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that's...
that's
the
one
case.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
that
case
under
our
theory
was
wrongly
decided,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the...
that
was
a
case
where
the
authority
was
transferred
from
the
local
legislative
delegation
to
the
governor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--to
appoint
this
racing
commission.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes.
in
fact,
the
justice
department
said
so
at
the
time.
they
took
the
opposite
position
in
that
case
in--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
yes.
the
point
i
make
about
that
is
that
they
have...
they
have,
to
the
extent
they've
commented
on
this
issue,
been
all
over
the
lot.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
other
thing
i
would
note
about
that
case,
your
honor,
in
that
case
judge
vance
said,
we're
going
to
cover
this
one,
but
the
vast
majority
of
routine
transfers
of
authority
that
occur
every
day
are
not,
in
the
view
of
this
court,
covered,
so
that
case
is
a
thin
reed
on
which
to
attach...
to
support
the...
the
huge
expansion
of
the
statute
that's
being
proposed
here
by
the
government
and
by
appellants.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
you
have
to
draw--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
you
have
to
draw
the
line
where
congress
drew
the
line.
it
said,
standards,
practices,
and
procedures
with
respect
to
voting,
and
a
transfer
of
authority
just
isn't...
doesn't
do
that.
first
of
all,
it
happens
after
people
are
in
office,
typically.
it
affects
incumbent
officials
and
is...
is
therefore
not
an
electoral
procedural
change.
now,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
substantive
test
that
gets
applied
under
section
5,
because
even
leaving
aside
the
plain
language--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
don't
think
that
makes
a
difference,
your
honor.
that
is
in
fact
what
happened
in
hardy
v.
wallace.
they
took
the
power
away
when
the
outgoing
white
legislative
delegation
engineered
this
so
their
successors--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
it
doesn't
change
the
offices
that
are
on
the
ballot
and
it
doesn't
change
who
votes
or
how
they
vote.
it
does
change
the
power
of
the
people
who
are
in
office,
but
that's
true
of
everything
the
government
does,
virtually.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
perhaps,
but
certainly
changing
electoral
boundaries
does
affect
who
votes
and
the
nature
of
your
ability
to
influence
who
gets
elected
in
the
way
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
it
affects
your
ability
to
elect
a
candidate
of
your
choice,
which
has
sort
of
become
the
key...
the
key
kind
of
claim
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
a
change
in
what
somebody
does
after
they're
elected
in
some
sense
changes
the
nature
of
the
office,
but
if
you're
going
to
take
that
expansion,
then
you
basically
are
going
to
have
the
entire
functions
of
government
reviewed
under
this
preclearance
mechanism.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense,
your
honor.
think
how
many
state
laws
are
passed
by
every
state
legislative...
in
every
state
legislative
session
which
in
some
way
affect
the
relative
distribution
of
power
between
the
governor
of
that
state
and
the
legislature.
every
time
they
pass
a
new
program,
or
repeal
a
program,
or
modify
a
program,
that's
going
to
take
power
away
from--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--certainly
their
brief
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
a
transfer
of
authority
from
a
legislative
branch
to
a
governor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--would
be
covered,
and
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that
legislation
does
that
by
its
very
nature.
whenever
you
take--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
what
about...
just
to
focus
on
budgets
for
a
moment,
if
you
look
at
a
state
legislative
budget,
it
cuts
money
here
and
it
adds
money
there,
but
it
also
will
include
hundreds
of
different
specific
requirements
telling
the
governor
when
the
governor
can
move
money
from
this
line
item
to
this
line
item,
how
much
flexibility
they
have
here
and
there.
all
of
that
is...
is
the
distribution--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
that's
what
happens
when
a
legislature
delegates
power
to
the
governor.
the
decision
used
to
belong
to
the
legislature.
now
it
belongs
to
the
governor.
or
if
they
take
it
back,
it's
exactly
the
same
thing.
i'm
merely
applying
their
test,
which
they
claim
in
some
way
limits
the
scope
of
the
act,
but
it
doesn't
have
that
effect.
the
decision
making
authority
is
changed
every
day.
now--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
let
me
return
for
a
moment,
if
i
might,
to
how
this
would
get
decided
under
the
substantive
standard
in
section
5,
which
is
a
point
that
i
think
is
important.
this
effects
test
does
not
limit
federal
interference
to
situations
of
actual,
intentional
discrimination,
which
may
have
been
the
case
in
that
hardy
v.
wallace
example.
what
it
does
if
you
apply
it
to
transfers
of
power
is,
it
prevents
power
from
being
transferred
for
whatever
reason
from
an
official
who
is
subject
to
greater
minority
influence
and
control
to
an
official
with
less
minority
influence
and
control.
the
only
way
that
i
can
imagine
that
being
applied
is...
is
to
have
a
rule
that
says,
if
you've
got
an
official
over
here
with
a
nigh
percentage
of
minority
constituents
and
an
official
over
here
with
fewer,
you
simply
cannot
move
power,
under
that
effects
test,
from
the
one
official
to
the
other.
that
is,
in
fact,
what
you
would
have
to
do
if
you
tried
to
apply
that
kind
of
substantive
standard,
which
was
designed
for
election
procedures,
in
this
much
broader
context
of
transfers
of
authority.
so,
for
example,
just
to
give
an
example,
if
a
state
had
an
existing
arrangement
under
which
total
control
over
the
creation
of
school
curricula
was
delegated
to
local
school
districts
and
the
state
then,
for
its
own
good
and
legitimate
reasons,
decided
to
take
back
a
chunk
of
that
power
and
say...
tell
all
the
school
districts
they
have
to
teach
science
in
all
4
years
of
high
school,
or
just
set
a
state
curriculum
in
the
science
area,
that
would
be
the
transfer
of
a
chunk
of
authority
over
school
curricula
from
local
officials
subject
to
local
control
to
the
state
level.
the
appellant's
theory
is
not
only
that
that
would
have
to
be
precleared...
indeed,
every
time
the
state
changed
whatever
curricula
requirements
it
has
it
would
have
to
be
precleared...
it
would
not
only
have
to
be
precleared,
but
in
every
case
where
the
local
school
district
has
more
black
residents
than
the
state
as
a
whole,
it
would
be
prohibited
from
making
that
change,
because
it
would
have
the
effect
of
transferring
influence
over
that
policy
decision
from
a
smaller
group
of
people
where
blacks
may
predominate
to
a
larger
group
of
people...
the
population
of
the
whole
state...
where
blacks
don't
predominate.
so
unless
you're
going
to
ignore
the
substantive
test
that
congress
set
out
in
section
5,
you're
going
to
end
up
with...
with
results
which
are
just
so
far
beyond
what
congress
could
have
imagined
it
was
doing
that
they
call
into
question
the
entire
statutory
interpretation.
going
back
just
for
a
moment
to
the
issue
of
the
frequency
with
which
this
happens,
the
school
example,
i
think,
makes
it
clear
that
you're
going
to
have
a
huge
number
of
cases
in
which
state
government
will
transfer
authority
back
and
forth
between
the
state
level
and
the
local
level.
any
time
a
state
law
addresses
local
government,
what
they're
doing
is,
they're
saying
you
should
zone
in
this
way,
don't
zone
in
this
way,
run
your
schools
this
way,
you're
allowed
to
have
cable
television
in
your
county
or
you're
not...
those
kinds
of
things.
all
of
that
is
a
transfer
of
decision
making
authority.
it
all
may
be
phrased
in
different
ways,
but
ultimately
if
you're
going
to
have
a
principle
like
this
you're
going
to
have
a
huge
number
of
laws
like
that,
and
of
course,
at
the
local
level
the
number
of
times
that
a
city
council
may
tell
the
mayor
what
to
do,
or
the
county
commissioners
may
divide
up
their
delegated
executive
functions
in
etowah
county
or
russell
county
are
going
to...
are
going
to
be
nearly
infinite,
and
all
of
those
things
would
then
be
subject
to
this
effects
test
and
to
a
preclearance
process
which
is
going
to
change
the
way
government
is
really
conducted
in
these
jurisdictions.
you're
going
to
have
to
prepare
this
package
of
stuff,
send
it
in
and
wait
60
days
for
almost
every
law
that
gets
passed
in
order
to
be...
be
confident
that
you're
not
going
to
be
subject
to
legal
challenge
at
some
later
date.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
let's...
the...
the
attorney
general
is
required
not
to
preclear
it
if
it
fails
the
effects
test,
and
then
when
the
attorney
general
says
well,
i'm
just
not
convinced
on
this,
you
don't
have
any
administrative
review.
your
only
alternative
at
that
point
is
to
go
to
the
district
of
columbia
district
and
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action
where
you
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
this
change
is
legal
under
the
standards
of
section
5.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
think
that
the
constitutional
claim
and
perhaps
the
title
vi
claim
may
be
open.
i
don't
think
the
section
2
claim
is
open,
and
i...
and
i
think
it's
pretty
likely
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
claim
doesn't
work,
but
there
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim
for
sure,
and
that
was
pleaded
from
the
beginning,
and
the
court
left
that
open.
let
me
just
make...
make
one
final
point
about
this
question
of
how
many
things
would
be
subject
to
legal
challenge.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in
section
5.
if
something
is
done
that
should
have
been
precleared
and
isn't,
then
it
can
be
challenged
at
any
time
thereafter,
and
if
we
look
at
how
many
things
might
be
viewed
as
involving
some
kind
of
transfer
of
authority...
and
we
have
appellants
here
saying
every
budget
that's
ever
passed
could
be
viewed
in
that
way
and
should
be
precleared...
then
we
have
to
think
about
how
many
things
have
been
done
in
these
jurisdictions
since
1965
that
now
would
be
called
into
legal
jeopardy
if
appellants'
and
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute
were
accepted.
essentially,
you'd
have
utter
chaos
in
these
nine
states
and
part
of
seven
others
that
have
been
operating
under
this
statute
for
these
years.
whole
departments
of
state
government
have
been
created
since
1965.
money
has
been
shifted
and
power
has
been
shifted
in
innumerable
ways
as
government
has
evolved,
naturally,
over
that
period
of
time,
and
no
one
would
have
any
idea
what
the
law
was.
you...
you'd
spend
years
sorting
all
that
out
in
court
as
people
tried
to
figure
out,
does
this
particular
law
in
some
way
represent
a
redistribution
of
authority
different
from
that
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964?
so
it's
not
just
a
question
of
prospectively
how
much
would
have
to
be
reviewed
and
whether
the
justice
department
could
really
do
any
good,
looking
at
this
mountain
of
tens
of
thousands
of
things
they
would
receive
every
day,
but
going
backwards
you
would
basically
have
the
settled
expectations
of
everybody
in
those
jurisdictions
upset
for
a
considerable
period
of
years
to
come.
now,
in
view
of
all
this,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
congress,
whatever
its
concern
about
voting
rights
in
1965,
couldn't
have
intended
to
transform
the
justice
department
into
an
administrative
overseer
of
whole
chunks
of
substantive
legislation
and
other
things
that
in
some
way
could
be
viewed
as
affecting
the
authority
of
officials.
as
justice
powell
pointed
out
in
that
dissent
in
dougherty
that
we
discussed,
justice...
i
was
discussing
with
justice
blackmun,
there
is
an
enormous
intrusion
here
on
state
government.
whenever
you
have
a
federal
review,
administrative
review
of
state
statutes,
but
at
least
the
section
5
intrusion
is
tempered
by
the
fact
that
it's
limited
to
a
discrete
area
of
law,
voting
laws.
at
this
point,
that
whole
limitation
would
be
basically
lost,
and
you
would
have
the
federal
government
looking
at
almost
everything
the
state's
doing
and
telling
it
whether
it
can
go
ahead
or
has
to
file
a
lawsuit
to
get
permission
to
go
ahead,
and
as
i
suggested
before,
i
think
that
it's...
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
justice
department
would
find
that
needle
in
a
haystack
if
there
was
one,
it
would
be
able
to
say
look,
here
out
of
this
20,000
we
got
today,
these
two
don't
look
too
good
to
us,
because
maybe
they're
doing
it
for
racist
motives
and
we're
going...
we're
going
to
tell
them
not
to
do
those
two.
the
likelihood
of
any
benefit
coming
from
this--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
one
of
the
things
that
can
be
a
basis
for
invalidating
a
change...
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
either
way,
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
sure.
the...
whichever
way
it
goes,
there's
going
to
be
situations
in
which
there's
going
to
be
a
possibility
that
blacks
are
losing
power.
i
mean,
it
doesn't...
you
can
imagine
hypotheticals
all
different
ways.
just
to
summarize,
our
position
is
that
section
5
should
be
limited
to
things
that
directly
affect
the
way
elections
are
conducted
and
that
the
separate
area
of
reallocations
of
authority
is
not
being
left
without
a
remedy,
but
that
that
remedy
is
the
standard
constitutional
lawsuit
that's
brought
for
all
different
kinds
of
discrimination,
and
that
congress
obviously
never
contemplated
this
kind
of
expansion
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
