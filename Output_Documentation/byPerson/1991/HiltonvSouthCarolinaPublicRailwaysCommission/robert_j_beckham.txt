mr.
robert
j.
beckham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
another
opportunity
for
the
court
to
rule
upon
the
question
of
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the...
that
is
the
presence
or
the
absence
of
the
real
eleventh
amendment,
or
the
presence
or
the
absence
of
the
judicial
gloss
eleventh
amendment.
we
submit,
first
of
all,
that
the
case
below
is
clearly
in
conflict
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
parden
case,
in
the
petty
case
before
that,
and
indeed,
in
the
welch
case,
where
five
members
of
this
court
reaffirmed
the
validity
of
the
existence
and
the
viability
of
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
under
the
fela
or
the
jones
act
against
state-owned
entities.
in
addition
to
those
specific
authorities,
dealing
with
the
fela-jones
act,
we
have
cited
three
other
cases,
the
united
states
v.
california,
california
v.
taylor,
and
the
united
transportation
union
case,
all
consistently
holding
that
the
pervasive
effect
of
the
preemptive
power
of
congress
in
dealing
with
this
nation's
railroads,
mandate
that
there
is
a
uniform
system
that
applies
to
each
and
every
railroad
in
america.
we
still
believe
that
this
court's
decision
recently
in
the
port
authority
case
between...
dealing
with
the
entity
between
new
york
and
new
jersey,
implicitly
reaffirms
the
existence
of
this
cause
of
action.
in
the
path
case,
the
court
determined
that
there
was
expressed
statutory
waiver
of
immunity
from
federal
court
jurisdiction,
the
classic
eleventh
amendment
bar.
the
court
held
that
that
jurisdiction
had
been
waived...
the
bar
had
been
waived.
and
it
would
be,
it
seems
to
us,
entirely
fruitless
for
this
court
to
have
decided
that
case
if
in
any
event
the
statute
didn't
apply
to
state-owned
railroads.
the
court
determined,
though,
that
the
waiver
was
adequate
and
that
jurisdiction
did
exist
in
the
federal
courts
for
a
cause
of
action
under
the
jones
act-fela
to
be
brought
against
the
state-owned
entity.
we
contend
that
if
there
is
any
further
doubt
or
dispute
that
the
railroad
in
this
case,
by
a
series
of
methods
has...
south
carolina
has
consented
or
surrendered...
whatever
phraseology
that
may
be
in
current
vogue...
to
the
mandate
of
the
federal
law.
this
is
not
consent
to
where
they
may
be
sued.
this
is
not
consent
to
be
sued
in
the
federal
court.
it
is,
however,
consent
to
be
covered
by
the
cause
of
action
created
by
the
fela
or
the
jones
act.
we
recall
that
in
the
past
case
we
just
discussed,
consent
was
found
to
overcome
the
express
constitutional
bar
of
jurisdiction.
we
recall
in
the
case
of
clark
v.
barnard
that
the
filing
of
a
piece
of
paper
by
a
state
in
a
federal
court
can
submit
to
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
a
waiver
or
a
consent
or
a
surrender
to
anything
expressly
granted
to
the
states
in
the
constitution.
this
is
a
consent,
however,
we
contend,
to
the
reach
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
feel
that
here
are
two
or
three
types
of
express
consent,
depending
upon
the
cases
that
one
looks
to
from
this
court.
the
cases
that
talk
about
the
commerce
clause
and
its
effect
under
the
plan
of
the
convention
certainly
would
authorize
a
finding
that
any
state
that
engages
in
interstate
commerce
does
so
with
the
firm
understanding
that
at
the
time
the
state
came
into
the
union,
it
surrendered
its
authority
over
interstate
commerce
to
the
express
clause
of
the
commerce
clause
in
the
constitution.
we,
in
this
case,
however,
have
more.
we
have
specific
statutory
acknowledgment
by
the
south
carolina
legislature
that
recognizes
its
obedience
and
obeisance,
if
you
will,
to
federal
law.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
at
the
time
the
defendant
entity
was
created,
the
south
carolina
legislature
directed
that
they
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
south
carolina
legislature
acknowledged
that
they
were
operating
under
certificates
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
the
south
carolina
legislature
acknowledged
that
they
were
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
this
is
clear,
statutory
surrender,
if
you
will,
clear
statutory
acknowledgement
of
the
overwhelming
authority
of
the
federal
plan
governing
railroads
in
this
country.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
justice,
what
happened,
we
filed
this
case
in
the
federal
court
in
charleston.
and
the
welch
case
was
decided,
and
very
clearly
the
welch
case
said
there's
no
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
fela.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
that
was
the
holding
in
the
welch
decision.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
it's
specific
enough.
but
i
say
that
even
if
it
weren't
specific
enough,
the
voluntary
act
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
has
surrendered
to
that.
we
point
out
that
this...
the
whole
reason
for
the
concept
of
specificity
is
for
clarity.
how
much
more
clarity
could
exist?
when
south
carolina
in
1969
made
the
decision
to
create
the
defendant
agency,
this
court
by
that
time
had
decided
five
cases.
maybe
they
were
all
wrong,
but
the
court
was
very
clear
in
telling
everybody
in
america
that
railroad
legislation
by
congress
applied
to
state-owned
railroads.
a
statute
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
a
federal
scheme
of
regulations
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
certainly
gives
sufficient
clarity
and
advanced
knowledge.
there
was
no
sandbagging
of
south
carolina
here.
this
statute
was
created
in
1908,
i
believe.
the
decisions
of
this
court
started
in
the
thirties.
by
the
time
1969
came
along
and
south
carolina
submitted
this
plan
through
its
legislature,
it
was
very
clear.
no
statute
could
have
given
them
any
more
notice
that
they
were
walking
into
federal
regulation.
the
whole
purpose,
indeed
this--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--i
have
a
hard
time,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--understanding
whether
its
a
waiver
or
a
surrender.
the
court,
frankly,
in
various
opinions
kind
of
bounces
back
and
forth.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
in
the
statutory
enactments
that
i
referred
to,
the
south
carolina
court...
excuse
me...
legislature...
the
south
carolina
legislature,
expressly
acknowledges
the
existence
of
federal
regulatory
bodies
to
which
its
railroad
will
be
subservient.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
they
didn't
specify
fela.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
regrettably,
in
this
case,
we
were
pretermitted
at
the
lower
level
before
getting
a
lot
of
discovery.
in
the
parden
case,
they
showed,
i
believe,
that
the
railroad
employees
were
given
rule
books
that
talked
about
fela,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
this
case,
we
were
cut
off
at
the
pass
and
we
were
not...
we
don't
have
a
record
that
would
explain
precisely
what
they--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--mr.
justice,
first
of
all,
the
court
did
say
that
when
the
congress
said
every,
it
meant
every.
you
couldn't
get
any
more
all
inclusive
than
that.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
no
question.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
that
is
exactly--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--that's
one.
it
also...
the
court
also
said
that
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
by
rail,
that
they
had
either
surrendered
or
consented...
the
alabama
railroad
had
either
surrendered
or
consented.
as
you
read
through
the
decision
subsequently,
you'll
find
that
sometimes
parden
is
referred
to
as
an
authorization
case,
that
is
the
congress
authorized
it
by
virtue
of
saying
every.
sometimes
it's
referred
to
as
a
waiver
case.
sometimes
it's
referred
to
as
a
surrender
case.
so
that's
why
i
say
we
have
some
difficulty
in
knowing
exactly
which
hat
to
put
on
it.
but
it
did
cover
both
theories.
it
did
say
that
the
statute
was
broad
enough
and
there
was
no
question,
as
you
said,
that
literally
it
did
apply,
and
that
mr.
chief
justice
has
written
several
opinions,
edelman
and
quern,
i
believe,
specifically
talking
about
the
fact
that
there
was
no
question
in
petty
and
in
parden
that
the
state
was
literally
an
entity
that
was
within
the
description.
so
that
is--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--in
your
welch
decision,
mr.
chief
justice,
five
members
of
the
court
said
fela
survives.
the
plurality
opinion
for
the
court
by
justice
powell
carried
the
day
in
saying
federal
court
jurisdiction,
that
explicit
constitutional
language
had
not
been
overcome.
the
court
expressly
refrained
in
the
plurality
opinion
from
addressing
whether
the
fela
survived
against
state
entity.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
well,
there's
no
eleventh
amendment
problem
in
state
court
until
you
get
to
the
gloss
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
a
state
being
sued
in
a
state
court
presents
no
open
and
obvious
eleventh
amendment
problem.
and
of
course
this
was
highlighted
most
recently
on
the
opinion
in
the
will
case.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
this
irony
only
arises
because
of
the
welch
decision.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
no
question
about
it.
but--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--the
irony
was
not
created
by
parden.
but
you
also
have
this
to
consider,
that
in
the
concept
of
trying
to
deal
with
it,
the
employees...
the
missouri
case...
employees...
justice
marshall's
concurring
opinion
very
definitely
touched
upon
the
concept
that
it
is
indeed
possible
for
federal
rights
to
be
enforced
in
the
state
courts.
you
know,
one
of
the
things
in
the
maine
v.
thiboutot
case,
the
court
talked
about
in
a
footnote.
for
instance,
if
a
jurisdictional
amount...
we
now
have
increased
the
jurisdictional
amount
in
the
federal
court
to
much
more
than
the
$
10,
000
it
used
to
be.
there
are
many
cases
that
where
federal
rights
may
not
be
able
to
be
enforced
in
federal
courts
because
of
an
insufficient
amount
of
money
to
get
in
the
door.
and
those
rights
are
going
to
be
enforceable
in
state
courts.
there's
nothing
magic.
and
of
course,
all
the
supremacy
cases
tell
us
that
the
states
have
to
adjudicate
federal
rights
in
their
courts.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
i
think
that
it
is
difficult...
if
you
look
to
the
history,
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
this
case,
and
this
is
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said,
of
course.
they
said
they
found
the
will
case
dispositive
here.
we
think
that
that
is
giving
it
more
breadth
and
more
scope
than
it
needed.
first
of
all,
it
wasn't
a
commerce
clause
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
is
of
major
significance,
but
when
you
read
union
gas,
it
came
out
the
very
same
day
out
of
this
same
court.
you
get
a
different
reading
from
union
gas
as
to
the
scope.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
that
was
an
easy
distinction,
right.
in
reading
the
statute--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--that's
right.
and
every
such
common
carrier
is
covered
by
the
fela.
we
point
out
that
by
opening
its
own
courts
to
state
tort
claim--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
--it
certainly
seems
so
to
us.
as
we
point
out
in
the
urie
decision,
the
urie
case
talked
about
the
scope
of
it
in
terms
of
injury.
but
the
same
language
goes
for
the...
this
court
said
it
not
only
in
parden,
the
court
said
it
in
petty.
the
court
said
it
petty,
that
the
broadest
possible
language
that
was
utilized
left
the
court
no
way
out
but
to
say
that
states
were
included.
here's
what
we
say,
however.
you
know,
just
like
the
hans
case,
supposedly
now
has
added,
and
we
know
what
the
eleventh
amendment
means,
not
because
of
what
it
says,
but
because
of
what
this
court
says
it
says.
now,
once
this
court
has
said
what
title
45,
section
51
means,
then
that's
it.
this
court
has
said
it
means
every,
and
that
every
includes
states.
and
you've
said
it
time
and
time
and
time
again,
and
you
had
said
it
numerous
times
before
south
carolina
created
this
entity
in
1969.
all
this
business
about
needing
advance
notice
about
having
an
opportunity
to
debate
it
in
congress
before
the
law
was
passed,
all
this
need
for
clarity,
was
given
them
on
a
platter.
they
have
absolutely
no
basis
to
allege
that
this
catches
them
by
surprise,
that
they
had
no
idea
when
they
went
into
railroading
that
they
were
going
to
be
subject
to
fela.
they
had
been
told
time
and
time
and
time
again
by
this
court.
and
just
as
the
eleventh
amendment
loss
under
the
decision
in
hans
and
the
succeeding
opinions
of
this
court
give
meaning
to
what
the
eleventh
amendment
says
and
what
it
means
certainly
the
decisions
of
this
court
stating,
restating,
and
reaffirming
what
every
railroad
means,
has
to
mean
what
it
says.
so
we
think
that
the
necessity
for
the
clear
statement
in
legislation
has
been
supplanted
and
replaced
in
this
case
by
authoritative
and
definitive
judicial
interpretation.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time--
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
to
answer
one
of
the
questions,
the
jones
act
borrows
the
language
of
the
fela.
the
jones
act
states,
and
this
is
from
the
opinion
in
parden,
i
believe...
no,
in
welch...
in
welch.
"any
seaman
who
shall
suffer
personal
injury
in
the
course
of
his
employment
may
bring
a
lawsuit.
"
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
it
incorporates
by
reference
the
fela.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
and
that
gets
us
back
to
any
common
carrier.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
the
seaman's,
the
seaman's
employment.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
and
it
says
in
such
actions,
all
statutes
of
united
states
modifying
or
extending
the
common
law
right
of
remedy
in
case
of
personal
injury
to
railway
employees
shall
apply.
so
it's
a
borrowing
statement.
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
it
is
"every
employer
of
a
seaman".
mr.
robert
j.
beckham
they
just
borrow
the
statute
entirely.
and
they
say
that
it
goes
in
addition
to
seaworthiness
and
the
other
maritime
remedies
traditionally
available.
they
made
the
statutory
remedy
also
available.
now,
he
talks
in
terms
of
needing
some
advice
about
being
impacted,
one
of
the
things
that
our
amicus
brief
points
out
is
that
in
1939
there
was
wholesale
amendment
of
the
fela
by
congress.
and
by
that
time
this
court
had
already
held
that
states
were
subject
to
the
regulatory
power
of
the
federal
government.
and
congress
did
not
address
that
in
any
way
when
they
made
the
wholesale.
another
question
that
was
asked
about
the
remedies.
when
mr.
simons
was
asked
a
question
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
my
recollection
is
he
told
them
that
the
man
really
was
remediless.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
he
is
specifically
excluded
from
the
tort
claims
act
because
the
tort
claims
act
didn't
become
effective
until
after
his
injury.
we
point
out
also
that
he
is
specifically
excluded
from
the
workers'
comp
laws
by
definition.
and
this
is
very
significant.
we've
had
cited
you
a
higginbotham
case.
the
higginbotham
case
was
a
case
before
parden
which
held
the
same
way
that
parden
did.
but
its
significance
is
this.
higginbotham
is
louisiana.
here
we're
in
south
carolina.
there
has
been
a
subsequent
case
to
the
court's
opinion
in
welch,
the
laughinghouse
case,
out
of
the
appeal
court
in
north
carolina,
all
showing
that
states
have
relied
upon
the
concept
of
preemption
and
federal
regulation
and
pervasiveness.
and
railroad
men
are
routinely
excluded
from
other
schemes
of
compensation
for
on-the-job
injuries.
and
you'll
find
this...
and
the
south
carolina
statutes
exclude
it.
i
know
from
my
home
state
of
florida
that
you
find
it.
you'll
find
it
in
the
laughinghouse
case.
the
laughinghouse
case,
the
man...
the
north
carolina
court
dismissed
his
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
workman's
comp
bureau
on
the
basis
of
parden
and
welch.
they
said
true,
welch
overruled
the
preemptive
effect
of
the
fela
for
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court,
but
it's
still
good
law
insofar
as
the
fela
being
the
sole
remedy
because
congress
has
preempted
the
field.
and
you
will
find
this...
i
haven't
done
a
state-by-state
survey,
but
i
will
venture
to
say
that
you
will
find
in
many,
many,
many
states,
and
this
is
why
we
mention
it
in
our
reply
brief
the
significance
of
overruling
these
precedents
because
of
the
reliance
factor
that
mr.
chief
justice
referred
to
just
last
term
in
talking
about
considerations
when
cases
are
overruled
or
not
overruled.
and
you're
looking
at
a
steady
stream
of
opinions
out
of
this
court
concerning
the
railroad
industry
and
it's
uniqueness
in
this
country
and
it
its
jurisprudence.
and
to
overrule
these
cases
is
going
to
create
not
only
havoc
with
the
other
laws
that
we
talked
about,
but
you're
going
to
throw
a
lot
of
people
out.
they
won't
be
covered
anywhere
because
everybody
has
relied
upon
it,
and
the
legislatures
in
the
various
states
have
enacted
legislation
accordingly.
we
know,
in
answer
to
the
question
concerning
feeney
and
the
petty
cases,
some
argument
was
made
about
the
fact
that
they
weren't
states.
in
each
of
those
cases
this
court
proceeded
arguendo
as
if
they
were
states.
and
so
certainly
the
bench
and
the
bar
of
this
nation
in
reading
these
opinions
reads
them
as
this
court's
pronouncements
concerning
state
court
issues.
strangely
enough,
again,
respondent
acknowledges
that
it
doesn't
make
sense,
doesn't
make
sense
to
talk
about
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
a
cause
of
action
underneath
it.
and
certainly
that's
the
case
here.
the
path
case
only
makes
sense
if
the
statute
applies
to
that
state
entity.
otherwise,
the
court
didn't
need
to
be
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
it
waives
its
jurisdiction
to
be
sued
under
fela
or
jones
act
in
the
federal
court.
if
there
wasn't
any
cause
of
action
there
to
begin
with,
the
case
would
have
been
moot
and
the
court
wouldn't
have
heard
it.
at
page
22
of
our
amicus
brief,
counsel
has
cited
the
court
to
the
lowden
case,
the
u.s.
v.
lowden,
where
the
court
packaged
up
all
the
various
railroad
laws,
including
the
fela,
did
not
make
the
distinction
that
counsel
would
make
against
us
here
that,
well,
if
it's
a
regulation
law
that's
different
than
if
it's
a
money-damage
law.
number
one,
the
safety
appliance
act
is
a
penalty.
while
certainly
the
federal
government
can
extract
a
penalty
common
carrier
by
rail
who
violates
the
safety
appliance
act.
it
is
also,
however,
a
safety
statute
enacted
for
the
protection
of
employees,
and
it's
part
of
the
package.
and
the
court
said
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
union
gas,
many
times
money
damages
are
the
only
way
to
enforce
congressional
dictate.
and
the
court
further
said
in
that
case
we
are
in
a
situation
where
only
congress
can
act.
only
congress
can
act.
there
is
no
question
this
is
an
interstate
rail
operation.
there
is
no
question
it's
preempted.
everything
about
this
operation
falls
under
federal
control
except
now
they
would
say
they
want
to
carve
out
this
one
exception.
and
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
it
tears
at
the
fabric
of
the
scheme
of
things
that
has
been
put
together
by
congress
and
has
been
consistently
approved
by
this
court.
i
don't
know
the
answer
as
to
whether,
quote,
"sovereign
immunity",
that
principal
that
floats
around
the
eleventh
amendment,
whether
that
protects
an
otherwise
susceptible
defendant
from
the
application
of
a
congressional
statute.
but
if
it
does,
we
know
it's
clear
it's
not
the
pure
eleventh
amendment
that
protects
in
their
own
state
court.
if
there
is
any
principal
floating
around
that
they're
trying
to
take
advantage
of
here,
it
is
that
principal
of
sovereign
immunity
somehow
floating
with
the
eleventh
amendment.
now,
if
the
waiver
can
be
found
of
that
explicit
federal
court
lack
of
jurisdiction,
we
submit
that
consent
or
a
waiver
can
also
be
found
so
as
to
get
rid
of
that
sovereign
immunity
theory
that
otherwise
would
protect
them
in
their
own
court,
if
indeed
there
are
two
sovereign
immunities
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
if
indeed
the
more
stringent
on,
the
one
that's
explicitly
stated
as
a
bar
to
jurisdiction,
if
that
could
be
waived,
then
we'd
take
it
as
a
given,
that
the
subsidiary
"common
law",
quote,
type
of
immunity
can
also
be
waived.
and
if
it
can
be
waived,
they
have
done
it
in
this
case.
they've
done
it
by
the
virtue
of
their
statutes
showing
that
they
knew
when
they
came
in
we're
going
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
regulation.
they
have
done
it
by
carving
out
railroad
workers
and
not
giving
them
a
remedy
under
their
comp
law...
again
acknowledging
that
they
know
where
the
scheme
for
regulation
comes
from.
and
they
have
done
it
also
in
terms
of
acknowledging
by
virtue
of
their
statutes
that
the
railway
labor
act
applies,
that
they
simply
are
governed
by
federal
law.
now...
and
they
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
they
went
into
a
pervasively
regulated
area.
all
of
this...
all
of
this
was
done
knowingly.
all
of
this
was
done
after
this
court
had
repeatedly
placed
it
on
notice.
we
think
in
this
case
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
historic
powers
of
state
government
that
was
of
major
concern
to
this
court
in
cases
like
the
will
case.
we
were
not
dealing
with
matters
going
to
the
heart
of
representative
government
that
the
ashcroft
case
spoke
of
last
year.
these
are
not
governmental
proprietary
distinctions
we're
making,
but
in
the
utu
case,
a
unanimous
court,
led
by
chief
justice
burger.
in
the
utu
case,
a
unanimous
court
said
hey,
this
is
railroading.
this
is
not
state
government.
if
the
state
government
wants
to
do
it,
that's
fine.
we're
not
interfering
with
state
government,
we're
simply
talking
railroads.
and
so
we
are
not
addressing
here,
and
this
court's
opinion
will
not
reach
here.
any
so-called
heartbeat
of
america
federalism
problem.
we
just
don't
have
that.
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
trial.
thank
you.
