justice

but
not
fela.
justice
kennedy
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
are
there
any
actions
under
state
law
that
the
employee
can
bring
their
injuries
in
the
course
of
employment?
is
there
a
workman's
comp
scheme
that's
in
place
for
this
railroad?
justice
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
all
of
those
statutes
are
applicable
and
all
of
those
theories
are
applicable
to
the
railroad?
justice
kennedy
and
your
position
is
that
only
the
workman's
comp
statute
is
applicable?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
your...
do
you
have
a
position
that
it's
applicable
or
not?
justice
kennedy
so
it
is
possible,
at
least,
that
you
could
take
the
position
that
the
worker
is
not
entitled
to
any
recovery
until
the
south
carolina
legislature
acts?
justice
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
or
does
the
record
show
how
many
employees
there
are
of
the
state-owned
railroad?
justice
kennedy
in
yours.
justice
kennedy
well,
when
congress
determines
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
exercise
its
authority
to
expressly
apply
the
act
to
a
state,
is
it
making
a
jurisdictional
decision
when
it
talks
about
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
is
it
jurisdictional
when
it
weighs
the
eleventh
amendment
but
substantive
when
it
determines
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
apply
to
the
state?
i'm
not
quite...
how
do
you
know
when
it's
jurisdictional
and
when
it's
substantive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
case
involving
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
sometimes
called
fela.
the
statute
was
enacted
to
give
protection
under
federal
law
to
workers
who
are
injured
in
the
nation's
railroad
transportation
system.
this
case
presents
a
question
that
we
have
addressed
before,
whether
the
injured
worker
can
sue
under
the
act
if
the
railroad
is
owned
and
operated
by
a
state.
hilton,
who
is
the
petitioner
here,
brought
suit
alleging
that
he
sustained
injuries
while
he
was
working
for
a
railroad
which
was
owned
by
a
state
entity.
the
state
entity
is
the
respondent,
the
south
carolina
public
railways
commission.
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
after
it
ruled
that
hilton's
state
court
action
must
be
dismissed.
as
i
have
indicated,
we
face
this
general
issue
before.
in
parden
versus
terminal
railway,
a
case
decided
in
1964,
we
held
that
a
railway
worker
could
sue
a
state-owned
railroad
in
federal
court.
in
a
later
case,
though,
welch
versus
the
texas
department
of
highways
which
was
decided
in
1987,
we
overruled
the
part
of
the
1964
case.
in
welch,
we
said
that
states
have
immunity
from
fela
suits
when
the
action
is
commenced
in
federal
court.
hilton
brought
this
suit
in
the
state
court
and
the
question
now
before
us
is
whether
parden
overruled
welch
on
such
broad
grounds
that
the
fela
suit
against
the
state
may
not
be
maintained
in
a
state
court
either.
today,
we
hold
that
parden
is
still
good
law
as
applied
to
fela
suits
commenced
in
state
courts.
there
are
strong
considerations
for
adherence
to
stare
decisis
in
this
case
and
insufficient
counter-veiling
justifications
for
departure
from
that
doctrine.
the
issue
today
is
one
of
statutory
construction
and
congress
has
accepted
our
parden
interpretation
for
almost
30
years.
many
states
have
legislated
relying
on
parden
and
therefore,
excluded
railroad
workers
from
their
workman's
compensation
schemes.
to
overrule
parden
would
require
an
extensive
legislative
response
from
these
state
and
would
dislodge
the
settled
rights
and
expectations
of
both
employees
and
employers.
for
all
these
reasons
we
decline
to
depart
from
our
precedents.
we
hold
that
fela
does
create
a
cause
of
action
against
state
on
railroads
and
it
is
enforceable
in
state
court
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
is
reversed.
justice
blackmun
concurs
in
the
judgment;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
