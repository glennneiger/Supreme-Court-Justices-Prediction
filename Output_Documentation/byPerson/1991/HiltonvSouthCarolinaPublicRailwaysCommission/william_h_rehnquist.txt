chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-848,
kenneth
hilton
v.
south
carolina
public
railways
commission.
mr.
beckham.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
it's
not
a
waiver
you're
relying
on,
mr.
beckham.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
know--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--a
waiver,
we
have
talked
about
in
other
cases,
being
a
conscious
surrender
of
a
knowing
right
or
something.
you're
not
talking
about
that
sort
of
thing,
are
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
happens
to
your
argument
as
a
result
of
the
treatment
of
parden
in
our
welch
decision...
or
decisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
certain
irony,
and
maybe
it's
self-engendered
as
a
result
of
our
opinions,
that
congress
would
pass
a
statute
regulating
a
liability
of
railroads
to
their
employees.
and
it
is
not
applicable
to
state
railroads
in
federal
court,
but
it
is
applicable
to
state
railroads
in
state
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
have
to
deal
with
the
welch
decision.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
beckham.
mr.
simons,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
doesn't
say
xxx
may
sue?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
directly
involved
in
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
1887
was
the
first
federal
regulation.
and
didn't
they...
weren't
they
talking
about
common
carriers
in
those
days?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
simons.
mr.
beckham,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
doesn't
describe
the
defendant
any
more
that
that,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
is
there
any
counterpart
in
the
jones
act
to
the
language
in
the
fela
that
says
"every
common
carrier
by
railroad",
which
names
a
class
of
potential
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
every
employer
of
a
seaman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beckham.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-848,
hilton
versus
south
carolina
public
railways
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
