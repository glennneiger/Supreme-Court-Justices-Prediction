justice
white
xxx
suit
would
not
lie
in
the
federal
court.
justice
white
so
this
statute
wasn't
specific
enough
to
do
away
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
but--
justice
white
--but
you
think
it's
specific
enough
to
overcome
the
usual
rule
that
you...
federal
statute
that
if
it's
going
to
bind,
the
state
ought
to
be
pretty
specific.
justice
white
what
theory
did
parden
proceed
on?
was
it
the
every
common
carrier
by
railroad
is
specific
enough
to
include
a
state?
is
that
what
the
court
said?
justice
white
and
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
common
carrier
involved.
justice
white
the
only
question
was
that
the
state
owned
it.
justice
white
is
that
the
theory
the
court
proceeded
on?
justice
white
well,
just
assume
that
the
fela
applied...
would
apply
to
the
states,
i
guess.
because
otherwise
there's
no
eleventh
amendment
problem.
justice
white
at
least
will
just
said
a
state
wasn't
a
person
at
all.
justice
white
but
the
question...
there's
no
question
here
of
what
there
is
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
involved.
justice
white
i
suppose
the
statute
at
least
means
that
every
owner
of
a
railroad
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
is
covered
by
the
fela.
justice
white
are
you
questioning
the
power
of
congress
to
subject
a
state-owned
railroad
to
the
fela
if
it
said
so
expressly?
justice
white
so
as
the
case
comes
to
use
we
assume
that
that--
justice
white
--well,
so
far,
parden
hasn't
been
overruled
in
that
respect.
justice
white
parden
held,
isn't
it?
justice
white
that
hasn't
been
overruled
that
the--
justice
white
--yeah,
that's...
you're
certainly
asking
us
at
least
that
much.
justice
white
don't
you
think
that
the...
whether
or
not
the
fela
covers
the...
includes
a
state,
really
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
we're
absolutely
clear
that
the
fela
just
didn't
reach
a
state.
what
if
the
fela
said
except
for
railroads
owned
by
a
state.
and
then
the...
somebody
doesn't
read
the
statute
and
he
sues
under
the
fela...
sues
the
state-owned
railroad
under
the
fela
in
state
court.
justice
white
of
course.
and
it
isn't
going
to
do
any
good
to
say
that,
well,
the
state
has
waived
it's
sovereign
immunity,
would
it?
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
yeah,
but
what
if
we
say
that
every
railroad,
every
common
carrier
by
railroad
means
what
it
says.
it
includes
a
railroad
owned
by
a
state.
then
this
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
we
just
say
that
the
clear
statement
rule
satisfied.
justice
white
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
just
asked
you
wouldn't
the
case
be
over
if
we
misguidedly
did
that?
justice
white
to
what,
for
example?
the
difference
between
the
word
"person"
and
"every
common
carrier
by
railroad"?
justice
white
can
you
say
the
same
about...
can
you
say
the
same
in
a
non-eleventh
amendment
case
as
to...
do
you
think
that
a
state
has
never
been
held
liable
under
a
statute
that
doesn't
expressly...
a
federal
statute
that
doesn't
expressly
refer
to
a
state?
well,
you
know
that's
not
so.
how
about
in
the
maritime?
justice
white
well,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
it?
justice
white
how
about
the
jones
act?
justice
white
well,
so
we
have
to
overrule
the
jones
act
cases,
too.
justice
white
well,
but
if,
i
suppose
the
fela
argument
for
coverage
would
be
stronger
than
the
jones
act
because
it
says
"every
common
carrier".
justice
white
well,
what
language
does
the
jones
act
use,
if
you
happen
to
know,
about
the
defendant?
how
does
it
describe
potential
defendants?
justice
white
well,
in
the
welch
case
it
said
the
act
involve
there
didn't
apply,
that
the
state
was
immune
from
suit
in
federal
court
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
but
it
didn't
purport
to
disturb
those
cases,
those
jones
act
cases
that
said
the
jones
act
covered
states.
justice
white
well,
they
disposed
of
it
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds.
justice
white
there's
no...
hardly
any
reason
to
do
that
if
the
jones
act
didn't
cover
it
at
all.
justice
white
you
always
talk
about
jurisdiction
first?
justice
white
what's
your
best
case
that
says
that
every
common
carrier
by
railroad
doesn't
include
a
state-owned
railroad?
is
it
welch?
justice
white
so
you're
saying
the
same
rule
has
to
apply
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
even
covers
the
state.
justice
white
you
think
welch
is
better
for
you
than
will,
don't
you?
justice
white
i
know,
but
not
every
reasonable
person
would
think
the
word
"person"
includes
a
state,
would
you?
justice
white
no,
but
every
common
carrier.
justice
white
i
know,
but
every
common
carrier...
it's
a
railroad.
justice
white
well,
when
was
the...
how
long
had
railroads
been
regulated
in
1908?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
in
the
course
of--
justice
white
--it
says
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
what
employment?
justice
white
i
know,
but
i'm
sure
that
both...
a
lot
of
the
definitions
of
what
a
seaman
is
and
what
maritime
employment
is.
