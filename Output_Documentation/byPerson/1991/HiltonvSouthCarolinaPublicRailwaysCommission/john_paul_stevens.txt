justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
statutory
construction?
are
you
in
effect
saying
that
the
statute
should
have
said
every
common
carrier
by
railroad,
including
those
owned
by
the
states,
shall
blah,
blah,
blah?
justice
stevens
and
so...
without
that
language,
you're
saying
it
isn't
clear
congress
intended
to
subject
states
to
this
statute.
does
that
mean
that
the
statutes
like
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
all
other
federal
statutes
regulating
railroads
are
inapplicable
to
the
states
unless
congress
amends
them
in
the
manner
i've
just
suggested?
justice
stevens
but
don't
you
need
a
clear
statement
of
relief
there?
justice
stevens
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
provides
for
a
cause
of
action.
in
the
california
case
they
sued
for
$
100.
justice
stevens
really
i'm
asking
do
you
think
those
statutes
apply
to
state-owned
railroads?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
asking
you
do
you
think
those
statutes...
you
surely
have
thought
about
that
because
is
a
rather
far-reaching
position
you're
taking
here.
do
you
think
those
statutes
apply
to
state-owned
railroads?
the
four
or
five
statutes,
the
federal
statutes,
that
govern
the
operation
of
railroads
generally?
justice
stevens
and
you
don't
think
the
words
"every
common
carrier
by
railroad"
would
let
a
state
know
that
their
railroads
were
also
intended
to
be
covered.
justice
stevens
had
any
case
said
that
at
the
time
that
you
entered
into
the
railroad
business?
justice
stevens
you
surely
wouldn't
win
under
parden.
justice
stevens
is
there
any
case
that
supports
your
position
that
was
decided
before
you
went
into
the
railroad
business?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
suppose
congress
was
supposed
to
know
they
needed
a
clear
statement
of
the
kind
you
describe?
