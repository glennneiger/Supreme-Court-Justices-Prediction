mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
questions
asked
of
mr.
beckham
by
this
court
vividly
illustrate,
this
is
not
simply
a
case
about
railroads.
nor
is
it
simply
a
case
about
federal
regulation
of
states.
there
are
two
essential
features
to
this
case.
one
is
the
traditional
well
and
clearly
regarded
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states
in
their
own
courts,
and
the
other
is
the
clear
statement
rule.
counsel
argues
that
fela
permits
his
client
to
sue
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
our
own
courts
for
money
damages
for
personal
injuries
as
a
result
of
alleged
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
that
is
an
extraordinary
result
of
a
federal
statute.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
we
have
not
found
occasion
in
this
case
to
directly
challenge
the
power
of
congress
to
create
a
personal
injury
liability.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
absolutely.
i
think
that
a
number
of
justices
of
this
court
have
raised
questions
about
the
existence
of
closely
related
powers.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
that's
correct,
sir.
we
do
not
directly
challenge
the
power
issue
here
today.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
absolutely.
it's
not
a
matter
of--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--the
issues
just
simply
weren't
directly
raised
in
the
way
that
the
issue
has
come
before
the
court
today.
in
feeney
and
petty,
those
were
bistate
compact
cases
which
are
slightly
different
from
a
case
against
a
state
directly.
furthermore,
the
issues
were
directly
eleventh
amendment
issues.
and
the
pure
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
or
consent
to
federal
adjudication.
those
were
the
issues
in
those
cases.
insofar
as
we
know,
this
case
is
only
the
second
case,
will
being
the
other,
in
which
a
clear
statement
type
of
analysis
has
been
applied
to
the
statutory
interpretation
issue,
and
how
it
impacts
upon--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--the
difficulty
i
have
with
the
waiver
analysis
that
counsel
has
argued
is
that...
i
believe
it
was
in
howlett
v.
rose,
and
perhaps
other
cases
as
well...
in
which
the
comment
was
made
that
one
cannot
consent
to
the
applicability
of
a
cause
of
action
that
doesn't
apply
to
them.
what
we
have
here
is
one
could
consent
to
having
their
liability
adjudicated
in
federal
court,
if
the
liability
otherwise
attached.
but
to
say
that
south
carolina
could
consent
to
fela
means
to
say
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
could
decline
to
consent.
and
that
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
supremacy
clause.
it
would
also
fly
in
the
case
of
the
uniformity
interests
that
petitioner
would
argue
underlay
fela
and
all
the
other
federal
regulation
of
railroads.
so
i
submit
that
consent
has
got
simply
no
place
in
this
case
at
all.
what
we're
searching
for
is
did
congress
intend
fela
to
reach
railroads
owned
and
operated
by
states.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
may
be
found
in
the
clear
statement
rule.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
that
certainly
would
have
sufficed
for
our
purposes.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
those
statutes
are
very
different
from
the
fela
in
that
they
are
regulatory
statutes.
they
say--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--well--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--it's
my
understanding
that
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
directly
create
a
cause
of
action
and
that
the
practice
is
that
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
is
used
almost
as
negligence,
per
se,
in
fela
action.
the
primary
thrust
of
the
safety
appliance
act
is
regulation.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
think
that
congress
has
the
power
to--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
do
not
believe
they
should.
i
believe
that
congress
should
be
required
to
clearly
state
its
intention
before
telling
a
state
how
to
conduct
its
business.
that's
what
i
believe.
now,
that
is--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--the
decisions
of
this
court
have
repeatedly
said
that
states
are
different;
they
are
entitled
to
be
treated
with
greater
deference
and
greater
respect
than
any
other
employer.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
even
parden
referred
to
the
special
status
of
states.
the
parden
court
opted
to--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--absolutely
not.
i
recognize
that.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
not
directly,
no,
sir.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
at
the
time
the
fela
was
passed,
i
don't
believe
it
ever
occurred
to
congress
that
they
had
the
power
to
subject
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
a
damages
liability
in
its
own
courts.
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
was
so
well
entrenched
in
the
common
law
of
this
country
in
1908,
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
congress
they
could
do
that.
so
they
wouldn't
have
taken
the
next
step
and
said
well,
what
do
we
need
to
say
to
abrogate
that
immunity.
i
don't
believe
they
thought
they
had
the
power
to
do
so.
no
matter
how
you
parse
the
issues
in
this
case,
the
state
of
south
carolina
enjoyed
sovereign
immunity
in
its
own
courts
and
at
the
time
that
mr.
hilton
was
injured,
and
abrogation
of
that
immunity
by
congress
is
what
is
fundamentally
at
stake
here.
in
the
most
general
language
imaginable,
every
common
carrier,
with
no
other
reference
to
the
states,
petitioner
have
you
hold
that
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
has
been
abrogated.
in
welch--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--yes,
sir.
parden--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--no,
sir.
and
i
believe
that
parden
needs
to
be
overruled
today.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
absolutely.
parden
was
a
consent
case
in
response
to
the
question
i
believe
you
asked
mr.
beckham.
it
was
internally
inconsistent
in
that
when
parden
said
that
the
states
had
surrendered
all
immunity,
and
then
to
go
on
and
to
hold
that
they
had
surrendered
that
immunity,
that
i
don't
believe
bears
analytical
scrutiny.
so
i
think
that
in
the
final
analysis,
parden
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
consent
case.
and
the
federalism
decisions
since
that
time
issued
by
this
court
have
demonstrated
that
before
congress
can
put
the
states
to
the
choice,
they
have
to
do
so
clearly.
and
that
has
not
been
done
in
this
instance.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
the
petitioner
filed,
after
the
trial
judge's
order
dismissing
the
fela
claim,
an
amended
complaint
that
asserted
remedies
in
negligence,
asserted
remedies
in
under
the
tort
claims
act,
asserted
remedies
under
the...
what
we
call
the
little
fela,
which
is
the
south
carolina
version
of
fela.
furthermore--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--the
fourth
one,
that
i
was
about
to
mention,
your
honor,
is
where
i
believe
petitioner
has
his
avenue.
petitioner's
also
filed
a
workers'
compensation
claim
that
has
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
these
proceedings.
so
petitioner
clearly
believes
that
there
are
other
avenues
for
redress
for
his
injury.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
believe
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that
is
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
will
hold.
like
many
workers'
compensation--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
don't
have
a
position
today.
i
can
illustrate
the
difficulty
with
the
south
carolina
workers'
compensation
act,
and
that
is
like
so
many
others
it
includes
and
exclusion
for
railroad
workers.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
that
is
conceivable
that
the
commission
could
take
that
position.
it
has
not
taken
any
position
on
those
issues
as
of
yet.
the
south
carolina
workers'
compensation
act
expressly
covers
employees
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
mr.
hilton
is
an
employee
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
so
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
workers'
compensation
act
that
i
think
is
easily
resolvable
to
construe
the
railroad
worker
exclusion
is
to
be
one
who
works
for
the
railroad
companies
as
opposed
to
a
state
employee
who
works
on
railroad
tracks.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
throughout
the
country
or
ours?
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
in
the
order
of
a
couple
of
dozen.
it's
a
very
small
railroad.
there
are
only
approximately
1,000
employees
nationwide
of
state-owned
railroads.
i
mean,
it's
a
fairly
minuscule
problem
in
the
overall
scheme
of
things.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
fela
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
no,
sir.
i
believe
that's
my
point
on
the
consent
argument...
that
you
can't
consent
to
a
statute
that
doesn't
apply
to
you.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
so
i
don't
see
this
as
a
consent
case
at
all.
what
we're
dealing
with
is
whether,
as
in
will,
this
court
is
going
to
be
guided
by
the
existence
of
an
eleventh
amendment
principals
in
determining
the
meaning
of
the
words
"every
common
carrier
by
railroad".
that
is
the
issue
here.
if
the
clear
statement
rule
that
was
elaborated
in
a
number
of
cases
from
atascadero
right
up
to
will
and
dellmuth
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
if
that
rule
applies,
fela
does
not.
and
if
the
clear
statement
rule
doesn't
apply,
then
one
would
have
to
explain
why
the
state's
sovereign
immunity,
in
its
own
courts--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
believe
that
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
do
and
reconcile
with
recent
cases
as
to
what
it
takes--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--yes,
sir.
if
the
court
determined
that
the
words
included
states,
i
lose.
i
grant
you
that.
but
then
the
difficult
task
of
opinion
writing
begins
in
explaining
that
result
in
comparison
to
will--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
think
that
i've
not
seen
a
case
yet
that
found
an
abrogation
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
that
did
not
expressly
refer
to
states
or
governmental
units
or
public
funded
or
some
words
that
showed
congress
actually
considered
the
point.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
that
was
a
regulatory
statute
to
the
best
of
my
recollection.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
because
i
think
there's
a
very
grave
difference
between
regulating
a
state's
conduct
of
its
activities
in
the
equivalent
of
a
prospective
fashion.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
think
the
jones
act
and
fela
stand
in
the
same...
stand
in
the
same
shoes.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
mean,
i
believe
that
the
logic
of
it
reaches
the
same
conclusion.
if
"every
common
carrier"
is
not
enough
to
clearly
include
states,
then
"every
seaman"
is
not
clear
enough
either.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
think
i'd
probably
agree
with
you.
i
had
not
analyzed
it
from
a
comparison
of
the
two
statutes,
but
on
first
glance,
i
think
you're
probably
right.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
potential
defendants
are
described
at
all.
i
believe
it's
every
seaman
who's
injured
in
the
course
of
his
employment
or
words
to
that
effect.
but
i--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
don't
know.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
there
are
essentially
four
reasons
why
the
south
carolina
public
railways
commission
believes
that
the
clear
statement
rule
applies
to
the
statutory
interpretation
issue
at
hand.
one
is
the
eleventh
amendment
cases
that
we've
touched
upon.
another
is
will
that
we've
also
touched
upon.
another
is
the
requirement
in
a
number
of
other
contexts...
granted,
unrelated
contexts...
for
a
similarly
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent.
and
lastly
is
this
court's
opinion
in
garcia
dealing
with
processed-based,
or
suggesting
the
need
for
processed-based
protections
for
encroachment
into
the
state's
sovereignty
under
the
commerce
clause.
we've
already
discussed
the
eleventh
amendment
in
some
detail,
but
one
point
i
think
bears
making.
and
that
is
that
it's
the
very
same
interest
at
stake.
i
grant
you
that
in
the
eleventh
amendment
context
we're
talking
about
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court.
and
in
the
context
we're
here
today
on,
we're
talking
about
immunity
in
state
court.
but
it's
the
very
same
state
interest
that
is
at
stake.
the
clear
statement
rule
grew
out
of
a
need
to
protect
the
state's
sovereignty.
the
sovereignty
didn't
exist
only
as
a
limitation
on
article
iii
judicial
power.
the
limitation
on
article
iii
judicial
power
existed
because
of
the
pre-existing
existence
of
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
state,
the
very
same
interests
that
are
at
stake
at
applying
general
language
to
abrogate
a
state's
immunity
in
its
own
courts.
and
i
would
suggest
on
that
ground
alone,
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
the
eleventh
amendment
line
of
cases
and
the
requirement
for
a
clear
statement
from
the
will
approach
and
the
statutory
interpretation
question
that
we
have
before
us
here
today.
now,
in
fact,
the
logic
of
that
carried
the
day
with
the
trial
judge
in
this
particular
case,
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
he
dismissed
the
petitioner's
original
complaint.
while
the
case
was
on
appeal,
this
court--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
no,
sir.
because
what
mr.
beckham
likes
to
call
the
judicial
gloss
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
eleventh
amendment
by
it's
terms
didn't
apply
to
what
are
now
all
of
the
eleventh
amendment
contexts.
to
the
extent
that
the
literal
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment
didn't
provide
the
source
of
the
immunity,
that
immunity
was
previously
existing.
and
that
is
the
very
same
immunity
that
we're
talking
about
here
today.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
don't
believe
that
we're
stretching
anything.
the
same
immunity
interest
is
what
formed
the
basis
for
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
eleventh
amendment
gloss,
and
the
clear
statement
rule.
it's
the
very
same
immunity
interest.
to
me--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--well,
i
don't
know
that
that's
necessarily...
i'm
sure
you're
right.
south
carolina
would
rather
be
tried
in
its
own
courts
than
in
federal
court.
yet,
submitting
to
trial
in
its
own
courts
is
every
bit
as
offensive
and
intrusive
as
subjecting
itself
to
trial
in
the
federal
courts,
maybe
even
more
so.
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
discussed
the
ancient
background
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
feudal
system
of
old
england,
and
referred
to
the
fact
that
lower
sovereigns
could
be
hailed
into
the
courts
of
higher
sovereigns.
and
that
was
not
infringement
upon
the
lower
sovereign's
immunity.
but
here,
if
you
liken
that
to
modern
times
as
best
you
can,
it's
not
so
offensive
for
south
carolina
to
have
to
appear
in
the
court
of
a
higher
sovereign
as
it
is
to
be
made
to
subject
itself
to
suit
in
its
own
courts.
i
mean,
that
is
a
real
slap
in
the
face.
while
this
case
was
pending
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court...
it
may
not
have
been
this
case;
it
may
have
been
the
earlier
case,
freeman,
upon
which
this
case
was
based...
this
court
decided
will.
and
we
regarded
that
as
dispositive.
and
for
that
reason
we
filed
supplemental
briefs.
and
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
ultimately
regarded
it
as
dispositive
because
what
we
had
been
arguing,
based
strictly
on
logic,
was
to
take
the
eleventh
amendment
clear
statement
test
and
apply
it
to
the
statutory
interpretation
side
of
the
equation.
and
all
we
had
to
go
on
was
logic,
at
least
what
we
regarded
as
logical.
perhaps
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
don't
see
it
that
way,
judging
from
some
of
the
questions,
but
that's
our
position.
and
will
for
the
first
time
made
that
transposition
for
us.
it
explicitly
considered
eleventh
amendment
considerations
in
determining
the
meaning
of
the
words
chosen
by
congress.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
no,
sir.
it
did
not.
and
it
did
not
need
to
because
it
disposed
of
the
case
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
correct.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
in
my
limited
experience
in
litigating--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--yes,
sir.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction,
the
court
doesn't
reach
the
merits.
and
certainly
whether
the
statute
applied
was
a
matter
on
the
merits.
and
in
that
case,
texas,
as
i
recall,
briefed
the
issue
of
whether
fela
or
the...
excuse
me,
the
jones
act
applied.
and
the
court
declined
to
reach
the
issue.
and
we
raised
that
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
one
that
this
court
declined
to
reach
in
welch,
we're
asking
the
court
to
grapple
with
today.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
the
south
carolina
public
railways
commission
believe
that
welch
and
will,
you
put
those
two
cases
together
and
the
case
closed.
but
there's
more
to
applying
the
clear
statement
rule
in
this
context
than
just
simply
a
couple
of
this
court's
opinions.
in
garcia,
this
court
backed
off,
if
you
will,
from
a
governmental
functions
test
of
limitations
on
the
commerce
clause
and
held,
as
best
as
i
can
understand
that
case,
that
the
limitations
on
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause
were
to
be
found
in
the
structure
of
our
government.
and
that
the
political
process
would
ensure
that
undue
encroachments
upon
the
states
would
not
be
enacted.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
yes.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
because
the
decision
to
make
the
state
suable
in
federal
court
implicates
jurisdictional
concerns.
the
decision
to
make
the
state
suable
at
all
implicates
substantive
concerns,
is
the
way
i
would
answer
that
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
accommodates
garcia
by
saying
that
if
congress
is
going
to
pass
a
law
that
substantively
impacts
the
states,
particularly
to
create
a
monetary
liability
that
prior
thereto
had
not
existed,
and
prior
thereto
was
under
the
sovereign
right
of
the
state
to
decide
whether
it
existed,
if
congress
is
going
to
exercise
that
type
of
power,
they
ought
to
do
so
clearly.
you
put
language
in
the
bill
that
puts
everyone
on
notice
that
the
states
maybe
impacted,
and
then
the
states
can
marshall
their
political
forces
if
they
oppose
it.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
suppose
it
is,
yes,
sir.
because
it
did
not
include
a
state-owned
railroad
for
purposes
of
abrogating
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
and
it's
not
clear
enough
for
that
purpose.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
i
believe
it
should,
yes,
sir.
that
would
certainly
have
a
salutary
effect
of
simplifying
this
area
of
the
law.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
well,
reading
them
together,
i
believe
i
win.
will,
i
will
grant
you,
went
further
than
just
the
language
of
the
statute
and
looked
at
other
indicia
of
congressional
intent.
i
believe
that
if
you
apply
the
same
analysis
that
the
will
court
did,
you
reach
the
same
result.
i
mean,
there
was
no
legislative
history
whatsoever,
and
as
the
court
said
in
will,
nothing
that
rose
to
the--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
think
it's
just
as
reasonable
to
suppose
that
not
every
reasonable
person
would
read
the
word
"common
carrier";
which
ordinarily
applies--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--well,
a
state
is
not
a
common
carrier.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
we
have
here
state
that
is
providing
carriage
of
goods
for
a
fee.
that
does
not
make
the
state
a
common
carrier
in
the
sense
that
those
words
probably
were
understood
by
people
in
1908.
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
have
searched
high
and
low
to
try
to
figure
out
what
congress
meant
by
the
words
1908.
i
have
found
nothing
that
would
shed
light
on
that.
i'd
like
to
close,
if
i
may--
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
--i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
keating
l.
simons,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
i
have
not
found
anything
that
would
have
included
a
state
within
the
words
"common
carrier".
in
garcia,
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
close
with
one
very
brief
passage.
i
think
it's
one
sentence.
the
garcia
court
said
that
any
substantive
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
commerce
clause
powers
must
find
its
justification
in
the
procedural
nature
of
this
basic
limitation
and
it
must
be
tailored
to
compensate
for
possible
failings
in
the
national
political
process.
what
is
more
fundamental
to
our
understanding
of
procedure
than
notice?
and
what
is
better
calculated
to
prevent
misunderstandings
between
congress
and
the
states
and
between
congress
and
this
court
than
a
clear
explication
within
the
words
of
the
statute
as
to
what
congress
intends,
particularly
when
congress
intends
to
exercise
and
assumed
sweeping
power
to
abrogate
the
states'
historical
immunity
in
their
own
courts?
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
