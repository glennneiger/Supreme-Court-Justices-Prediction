justice
scalia
well,
does
that
show
that
they
knew
of
the
right,
that
is
that
they
knew
that
they
weren't
subject
to
it
unless
they
said
they
were?
justice
scalia
so
that
it's
not
a
waiver
in
the
classic
sense
you're
talking
about.
justice
scalia
or
because
of
parden.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
at
least
there's
this
difference,
and
that
is
that
sovereign
immunity
insofar
as...
granted
that
the
background
of
it
existed
both
with
respect
to
suit
in
the
state's
own
courts
and
with
respect
to
suit
in
the
federal
courts,
the
background
existed
for
both,
but
that
background
was
codified
in
the
eleventh
amendment
as
to
one
and
was
not
codified
in
the
eleventh
amendment
as
to
the
other,
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
a
significant
difference?
justice
scalia
well,
there's
a
gloss
and
there
is
a
total
repainting.
i
mean,
you're
really
stretching
it
well
beyond
the
gloss.
justice
scalia
well,
there
is
an
additional
state
interest
in
not
having
to
subject
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
another
sovereign
and
having
to
try
cases
in
a
federal
court.
i
think,
generally
speaking,
the
state
would
rather
try
cases
in
its
own
judicial
system.
