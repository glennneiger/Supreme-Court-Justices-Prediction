justice
o'connor
--well,
how
do
you
distinguish
will
against
michigan,
then,
where
the
court
did
say
that
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity,
at
least
a
clear
statement
by
congress
is
required.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
we
have
to
assume
that
fela
does
not
apply
at
all
to
state-owned
railroads?
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
reconcile
feeney
and
the
port
authority
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
was
certainly
an
assumption
in
feeney
that
the
statute
covered
all
railroads,
and
the
states
could
waive
any
sovereign
immunity.
