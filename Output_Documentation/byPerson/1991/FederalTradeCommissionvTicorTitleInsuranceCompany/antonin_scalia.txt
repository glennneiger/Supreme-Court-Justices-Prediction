justice
scalia
excuse
me,
how
does
the
individual
who
has
to
know
whether
he
can
apply
that
rate
that
he's
agreed
with,
with
other
people
pursuant
to
this
state
scheme,
how
does
he
know
it...
i
mean
if
the
state
agency
just
has
a
regular
procedure
whereby
the
clerk
of
the
state
agency
after
30
days
issues
an
order
saying
the
rates
are
hereby
approved
and
the
individual
doesn't
really
know
whether
they
looked
at
them
or
didn't
look
at
them?
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
justice
scalia
but
how
does
he
find
out?
tell
me
how
he
would
do
that.
justice
scalia
what
if
the
order
is
not
signed
by
the
clerk
but
is
in
fact
signed
by
the
agency
heads,
a
majority
of
them
or
all
of
them,
but
in
fact
they
don't
look
at
it,
they
just
sign
it
routinely.
it
comes
around
after
30
days
and
they
sign
it
and
they
haven't
looked
at
it
all.
does
that
protect
them?
justice
scalia
i
know
it
is.
what's
the
answer?
justice
scalia
it
is
not.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
advantage,
though?
it
saves
the
clerk
from
signing
something
saying
the
commission
has
considered
this
rate
and
it's
okay?
justice
scalia
right.
i
was
going
to
ask
about
that.
justice
scalia
well,
suppose
the
state
agency
has
a
general
rule...
i
don't
see
how
it
would
apply
to
this
title
insurance,
but
it
would
apply
to
some
other
fields
of
regulation...
that
any
rate
that
will
affect
all
of
the
consumers
in
a
total
amount
of
less
than
$30
million
simply
won't
be
reviewed,
which
might
make
sense
given
the
staff
that
the
particular
agency
has
available.
suppose
they
have
that
rule,
we
just
won't
look
at
them
if
the
take
on
this
particular
rate
is
less
than
$30
million?
is
that
okay?
justice
scalia
that's
all
they
do.
that's
their
rule.
but
you
said
that
that's
good,
that
some
of
these
rates
aren't
worth
the
trouble.
justice
scalia
this
is
what
they
think.
okay,
make
it
$1
million...
$1
million.
justice
scalia
why?
i
don't...
how
would
you
decide
what's
minimal
consumer
impact?
i
assume
you
pick
some
number,
don't
you?
don't
you
want
to
be
consistent?
justice
scalia
i
understand
they
do,
but--
justice
scalia
--so
the
situation
you
have
left,
then,
is
that
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws
within
that
state,
people
can
collude
to
fix
rates
so
long
as
they
know
the
take
on
it
isn't
more
than
$1
million
within
that
state,
or
$30
million,
whatever
level
the
state
agency
picks.
isn't
that
the
result?
justice
scalia
well,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
christie.
either
this
is
administrative
efficiency
you're
talking
about,
and
that's
why
it's
useful,
in
which
case
i
do
think
any
agency
will
make
general
cuts
like
that.
they
say,
we're
not
going
to
look
at
this
entire
category,
and
that's
administratively
efficient.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
but
my
point
is,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
you
have
this
whole
unregulated
area.
you're
saying
the
sherman
act
shall
not
apply
even
though
this
area
is
unregulated.
justice
scalia
well,
of
course,
with
mccarran-ferguson
you
would
prevail
even
if
it
were
a
totally
inactive
state.
indeed,
if
there
were
no
state
regulatory
agency
i
assume
you'd
prevail,
wouldn't
you?
justice
scalia
and
you
think
that
that's
less
intrusive
upon
state
sovereignty
than
simply
looking
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
rate
was
considered?
don't
care
how
many
people
considered
it,
how
good
they
were,
was
the
rate
considered?
