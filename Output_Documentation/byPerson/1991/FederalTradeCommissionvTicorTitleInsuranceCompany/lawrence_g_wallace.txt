mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
the
starting
point
for
statutory
interpretation
is
the
statutory
text
that
congress
enacted.
that
admonition
has
relevance
here,
even
though
the
question
before
the
court
involves
the
scope
of
a
judicially
implied
exception
that
is
not
itself
to
be
found
in
the
statutory
text.
the
comprehensiveness
and
unqualified
nature
of
the
prohibitions
of
restraints
of
trade
and
of
unfair
methods
of
competition
that
are
in
the
text
nonetheless
have
much
to
say
about
the
proper
resolution
of
this
case.
in
the
parker
against
brown
line
of
decisions,
this
court
has
held
that
those
federal
statutory
prohibitions
of
commercial
conduct
should
not
be
interpreted
to
apply
to
the
activities
of
the
states
themselves
and
derivatively
to
private
conduct
that
implements
the
states'
regulatory
policies.
now,
the
basic
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
that
in
its
concern
to
give
generous
scope
to
this
implied
exemption,
in
its
concern
to
give
the
exemption
ample
elbow
room,
it
gave
the
exemption
a
penumbrile
expanse
that
cuts
into
the
quick
of
the
statutory
restraints
on
private
conduct
that
congress
did
enact,
the
statutory
commands
that
embody
what
this
court
has
described
as
our
national
policy
in
favor
of
competition,
and
most
emphatically
in
favor
of
price
competition
among
horizontal
competitors.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
approach,
this
court's
decisions
have
made
clear
that
primacy
is
to
be
given
to
the
statutory
command
and
that
the
scope
of
the
implied
exemption
is
limited
by
the
exemption's
purposes
and
is
to
be
delimited
so
as
to
preserve
the
effectiveness
of
congress's
prohibition
of
privately
imposed
trade
restraints.
this
is
the
jurisprudential
perspective
we
see
reflected
in
the
rigorous
two-prong
test
for
exemption
of
private
conduct
that
this
court
unanimously
adopted
in
the
midcal
aluminum
case
and
that
the
court
has
elaborated
in
subsequent
decisions.
the
first
prong
of
that
test,
that
there
must
be
a
clearly
articulated
state
policy,
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
as
it
reaches
this
court,
but
the
reasons
why
that
prong
alone
does
not
suffice
to
exempt
private
conduct
are
illuminating
in
considering
the
function
that
the
second
prong
must
play,
because
if
merely
a
clearly
articulated
state
policy
that
private
conduct
would
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
would
suffice,
the
states
would
in
effect
be
given
the
power
to
repeal
the
sherman
act
and
the
other
antitrust
laws
industry
by
industry
as
they
choose.
and
in
parker
against
brown
itself
the
court
recognized
that
that
cannot
be
the
case
under
our
constitutional
system
and
under
the
supremacy
clause,
and
said
that
a
state
does
not
give
immunity
to
those
who
violate
the
sherman
act
by
authorizing
them
to
violate
or
by
declaring
that
their
action
is
lawful,
something
that
the
court
quoted
again
just
a
year
or
so
ago
in
the
omni
case.
so
the
second
prong
is
of
crucial
importance
here,
and
the
second
prong
as
it
was
formulated
and
as
it's
been
repeated
every
time,
says
that
the
conduct
must
be
actively
supervised
by
the
state
itself,
and
every
time
the
court
has
formulated
this
prong
it
has
used
the
modifier
actively.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
i
may
say
so,
justice
o'connor,
that's
several
questions
rolled
into
one,
and
to
start
at
the
end,
the
standard
we
are
proposing
and
the
standard
you
just
described
are
two
different
standards.
i
think
what
you
just
described
is
the
way
others
have
portrayed
our
approach
to
this
question.
to
us
the
inquiry
is
a
much
simpler
one.
it
is
whether
there
has
been
review
and
approval
by
state
officials
of
the
proposed
rates,
and
we
mean
approval
of
the
substance
of
the
restraints.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
professors
areeda
and
turner
in
their
analysis
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
negative
option
approach
really
cannot
suffice
as
an
adequate
method
of
state
supervision.
we
don't
go
that
far.
we
think
that
there
can
be
a
showing
that
the
option
was
exercised
in
a
way
that
showed
that
the
state
officials
did
in
fact
approve
the
policies
and...
except
that
they
were
reviewed,
and
that
the
state
can
manifest
its
approval
in
any
way
it
sees
fit,
including
a
failure
to
disapprove,
as
long
as
there
is
assurance
that
the
state
has
reviewed
and
approved
the
restraint,
the
particular
restraint
as
consistent
with
the
state's
regulatory
policies.
it's
harder
to
manifest
that
in
a
negative
option
system
of
regulation,
but
it
can
be
manifested.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
believe
so.
we
think
that
the
only
inquiry
is
whether
the
state
made
that
determination,
whether
state
officials
determined
not
that
the
filing
was
approved
for
filing,
that
it
had
all
the
requisites,
as
we
explain
in
footnote
16
of
our
brief,
that
are
required
for
a
filing
to
be
put
into
the
file,
perhaps
made
available
for
public
scrutiny,
but
that
the
officials
have
determined
that
the
rate
itself
that
has
been
agreed
upon,
the
uniform
rate
that
was
submitted,
is
consistent
with
the
state's
regulatory
policy.
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--then
he
has
to
find
out
before
he
engages
in
conduct
that
would
be
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
similarly
a
violation
of
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
to
find
out
by
asking
the
officials
so
that
he's
got
an
answer
from
the
state
that
will
stand
up
under
scrutiny
in
proceedings
of
this
kind
so
that
he
can
make
his
defense
that
yes,
i
engaged
in
price
fixing
with
my
competitors,
but
the
prices
were
approved
by
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
a
difficult
question
of
fact.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
going
to
say
the
fact
that
the
agency
officials
signed
an
order
is
a
conclusive
showing
that
they
reviewed
and
approved
the
rates.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
not
a
conclusive
showing.
it
is
strong
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
acting
on
the
advice
of
counsel
in
conducting
their
business.
they're
aware
of
the
constraints
imposed
by
the
federal
antitrust
laws
on
price
fixing
among
horizontal
competitors,
and
they're
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
particular
state
program
and
can
find
out
more
about
the
nature
of
the
particular
state
program,
and
they're--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
one
way
of
going
about
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
obviously
with
a
public
utility
commission
that
issues
a
decision
or
that
holds
a
hearing,
you've
got
a
written
record.
it's
in
these
negative
option
systems
that
it
gets
more
difficult
to
the
point,
as
i
said,
where
professors
areeda
and
turner
thought
they
just
won't
suffice,
and
i
do
think
it's
more
of
a
burden
for
the
regulated
competitors
to
be
able
to
make
the
requisite
showing
when
that
is
the
kind
of
system
that
the
state
is
utilizing,
but
our
concern
has
to
be
that
unless
they
can
establish
that
defense
to
price
fixing,
congress
has
without
qualification
comprehensively
prohibited
price
fixing
among
competitors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
has
to
know,
for
business
planning
purposes
it
certainly
is
better
for
it
to
know
that
none
of
these
state
schemes
compel
the
companies
to
charge
uniform
rates,
even
if
a
submission
has
been
made.
they
are
still
free
to
deviate
from
those
under
these
schemes.
these
are
not
tariff
schemes
of
the
kind
that
you've
got
where
there
has...
you
know,
at
the
icc
or
something
of
that
sort,
so
the
prudent
course
of
action
is
for
them
to
continue
to
engage
in
price
competition
unless
and
until
they
can
assure
themselves
that
they
have
had
review
and
approval,
or
that
the
scheme
has
a
system
of
review
and
approval
that
they
are
entitled
to
rely
upon
as
having
been
applied
in
their
case,
a
system
of
actual
review
and
approval.
i'm
not...
the
commission
has
said
that
an
aberrational
failure
to
apply
the
scheme
accurately
and
properly
in
a
particular
case
is
not
going
to
defeat
the
exemption,
but
they
look
to
see
whether
the
rates
have
been
submitted
into
a
scheme
where
there
is
in
fact
review
and
approval
of
the
rates
themselves
as
consistent
with
the
state
regulatory
policy.
it
is
hard
to
see
what
else
suffices
under
the
very
standards
that
this
court
has
articulated
about
what
constitutes
satisfaction
of
the
active
supervision
prong
of
the
midcal
test.
the
court
has
said
that
there
must
be
review
of
the
particular
restraint
that's
being
imposed
and
the
state
must
make
it
its
own
rather
than
just
an
authorization
that
private
competitors
can
set
their
own
prices.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
various
statutes
articulate
mostly
policies
to
assure
that
there
will
not
be
discriminatory
practices
and
that
there
will
not
be
unreasonable
rate
practices,
and
the
submissions--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
submissions
do
require
supporting
data,
although
in
practice
sometimes
those
data
were
not
submitted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware.
they
authorize
it,
but
they
do
not
typically
require
them--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
join
in
the
rate
bureau.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
aware
of
any
of
these
programs
in
which
companies
are
required
to
join
in
a
rate
bureau
filing.
so
far
as
i
know
it
did
not
determine--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
am
told,
though
it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
that
the
programs
are
not
presently
in
use,
at
least
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
after
the
commission's
complaint
was
filed
in
this
case
there
were
some
treble
damage
actions
brought
and
consolidated
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
that
case
was
settled
out,
but
since
that
time
the
rate
bureaus
have
been
discontinued.
that's
my
understanding.
perhaps
counsel
would
correct
me
if
i
don't
understand
it
correctly
when
he
gets
up,
but
none
of
that
is
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
shy
away
from
what
we're
accused
of
by
filings
on
the
other
side
from
an
evaluation
of
the
quality
of
the
state
policy,
so
the
court's
cases
have
made
it
quite
clear
in
hoover
against
ronwin
and
others
that
the
states
can
choose
their
own
policy
and
it
isn't
up
to
federal
courts
in
deciding
whether
to
confer
an
antitrust
exemption
to
evaluate
whether
the
policy
is
a
wise
one,
whether
the
policy
adequately
protects
consumers
in
comparison
with
the
antitrust
laws
and
so
forth.
so
we
see
the
second
prong
inquiry
as
a
rather
simpler
one,
and
that
is
just
to
determine
the
fact
that
state
officials
have
looked
at
the
rate
and
substantively
determine
whether
the
rate
itself
complies
with
whatever
the
state's
policy
is.
that's
what
suffices,
and
that
is
what
the
commission
found
lacking
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
are
package
rates
involved
in
the
submissions
to
the
state
officials.
the
commission
challenged
only
the
search
and
examination
components,
which
are
the
larger
share
of
it,
because
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
exemption
for
the
business
of
insurance.
search
and
examination
are
conducted
separately
by
other
persons
than
insurance
companies
in
many
instances,
and
the
commission's
theory
was
that
that
is
not
part
of
the
business
of
insurance
within
the
exemption.
now,
in
one
of
the
states
at
issue
it
was
found
that
there
was
no
review
and
that
state...
and
this
is...
i'm
speaking
of
connecticut...
and
that
state
authorities
had
no
authority
to
review
a
very
important
element
of
the
insurer's
expenses,
namely
commissions
to
the
broker
or
sales
agent,
and
those
commissions
could
affect
all
of
the
charges,
you
see,
including
those
for
search
and
examination
services,
so
the
charges
can
get
intermixed
and
intertwined
in
a
way
that
affects
the
portion
of
the
price-fixing
that
the
commission
and
we
contend
is
not
within
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
exemption.
now,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
left
the
governing
principles
obscure,
and
we've
quoted
in
our
brief
relevant
portions
from
this
court's
opinions,
including
its
recent
opinion
in
patrick
against
burget.
respondents
and
their
amici
differ
in
how
they
would
modify
the
principles
this
court
has
so
carefully
formulated,
and
which
we
don't
believe
require
improvement,
and
we
certainly
don't
believe
would
be
improved
by
their
modifications.
respondents
themselves
defend
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
must
be
some
basic
level
of
activity.
it's
rather
hard
to
see
exactly
how
that
standard
can
be
reconciled
with
a
sentence
in
this
court's
opinion
in
patrick
against
burget
saying
on
page
101
of
volume
486,
the
mere
presence
of
some
state
involvement
or
monitoring
does
not
suffice,
and
then
with
a
supporting
citation
to
324
liquor--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
true
in
that
case,
but
not
in
324
liquor,
for
which
the
court
relied
in
the
citation
immediately
following
that
sentence.
in
any
event,
the
inquiry
if...
it
certainly
would
be
an
elaborate
process
to
try
to
reconcile
what
it
is
that
constitutes
some
basic
level
of
activity
that
does
not
constitute
reviewing
the
rate
itself
and
deciding
whether
the
rate
is
consistent
with
the
state's
regulatory
policies.
if
anything
would
generate
uncertainty
it
would
be
a
standard
that
looks
not
to
the
rate
but
looks
to
activities
that
are
really
off
point
for
the
purposes
of
the
exemption.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
you
have
added
a
little
bit
to
the
way
he
formulated
the
hypothetical
i
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
would
be
stronger
evidence
if
they
said
we
have
reviewed
the
substance
of
the
rate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
hesitate
to
say
that
any
one
piece
of
evidence
would
always
be
conclusive
regardless
of
what
other
evidence
there
is
in
a
particular
case.
i
think
that
as
you
formulated
it,
it
would
be
extremely
hard
to
overcome
in
any
case.
that's
as
far
as
i
could
go.
i
couldn't
really
commit
the
commission
beyond
that
or
anticipate
every
case
that
might
arise.
it's
an
evidentiary
question,
and
it's
seldom
that
any
one
piece
of
evidence
is
conclusive
for
all
cases
and
all
possible
hypotheticals
that
could
be
imagined.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
presumption
of
regularity
applies
when
there
is
a
duty
to
do
something
and
then
it's
a
rebuttable
presumption
in
a
particular
case.
we've
discussed
that
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
it
gets
closer,
it
seems
to
me,
when
we
speak
of
the
presumption
of
regularity,
to
the
structural
test
that
some
of
the
amici
suggest
as
a
replacement
for
the
court
of
appeals
test
and
for
the
formulations
this
court
has
used,
a
test
that
would
just
say
whether
state
authorities
had...
the
state
officials
had
the
authority
whether
they
used
it
or
not,
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
said,
that
they
must
have
and
exercise
the
authority.
this
would
require
not
a
simple
question
of
fact
of
whether
the
matter
was
reviewed,
but
a
really
quite
contentious
inquiry
into
what
are
the
duties
of
the
state
officials
under
the
particular
scheme.
as
you
can
see
from
the
filings
in
this
case,
there's
much
disagreement
about
what
were
the
legal
duties
of
the
officials
in
the
four
states
at
issue
here,
and
one
way
to
introduce
evidence
about
how
should
their
duties
be
interpreted
is
to
look
at
what
they
in
fact
have
been
doing
as
the
officials'
own
interpretation
of
the
duties,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
leads
to
a
much
more
contentious
kind
of
judgment
on
whether
the
officials
are
properly
carrying
out
their
duties
under
state
law
than
the
simple
inquiry
that
we
think
this
court's
cases
look
to,
the
simple
factual
question
of
did
they
review
and
approve
the
rates
as
consistent
with
their
policy
or
didn't
they,
regardless
of
whether
they
should
have
under
state
law.
mr.

g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
do,
because
all
of
those
are
questions
that
are
subject
to
debate
in
a
particular
case,
whether
that's
a
discretionary
duty
or
a
mandatory
duty,
whether
the
funding
and
the
staff
are
adequate
to
perform
the
duty
or
inadequate
and
they
really
can't
perform
the
duty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
price
restraints
must
be
the
policy
of
the
state,
the
state
must
have
adopted
the
particular
restraint
as
consistent
with
its
regulatory
policies.
if
the
state--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--what
the
court
has
said
is
that
state
involvement
in
what
are
actually
privately
imposed
price
restraints--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it's
hard
to
see
why
they
don't
emanate
from
the
private
parties
themselves
if
the
state
has
not
reviewed
and
approved
them.
if
i
may
reserve
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
trust
you
mean,
here
is
a
hypothetical,
because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
36
states
that
filed--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
this
case
describe
this
differently.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
36
states
have
filed
a
brief
saying
that
their
regulatory
options
are
in
fact
being
constricted
by
this
decision
because
relatively
modest
programs
would
have
drastic
consequences
on
consumers.
on
pages
6
to
8
we
have
summarized
the
evidence
found
by
the
commission
in
these
states
in
which
rates
were
allowed
to
go
into
effect
for
years
without
supporting
data
being
submitted
even
when
requested,
and
the
title
insurance
company
certainly
knew
they
weren't
submitting
the
requested
supporting
data.
of
course,
it's
easier
for
them
if
they
can
rely
on
the
mere
existence
of
a
program,
but
it
is
harder
on
the
states
than
on
the
consumers
and
on
the
policies
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
but
the
states
are
arguing
that
principles
of
federalism
would
support
their
having
the
option
to
do
more
modest
programs
without
having
the
drastic
consequences
found
here.
