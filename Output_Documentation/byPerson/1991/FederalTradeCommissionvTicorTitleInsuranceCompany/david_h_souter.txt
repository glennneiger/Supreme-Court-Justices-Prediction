souter
although
it
wasn't
specific
in
the
submission
of
the
states
that
were
supporting
the
petitioner,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
a
state
should
participate
at
two
levels,
both
at
the
level
at
which
the
rate
is
initially
determined
before
filing
and
in
the
review
after
filing.
do
any
states
have
state
representatives
that
participate
in
formulating
the
rating
bureau
recommendations?
