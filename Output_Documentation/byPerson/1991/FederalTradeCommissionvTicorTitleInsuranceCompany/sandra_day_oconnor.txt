justice
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
under
your
standard
as
proposed,
i
wonder
how
a
regulated
entity
or
business
would
ever
know
whether
the
action
was
going
to
be
protected
by
parker
immunity?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
area
where
we're
better
off
with
a
clearer
line
so
that
these
businesses
know
one
way
or
another
whether
there's
going
to
be
parker
immunity.
justice
o'connor
and
to
leave
it
open,
as
you
suggest,
to
evaluating
in
each
case
the
extent
to
which
the
state
is...
the
quality
of
its
activity
seems
to
me
problematic.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
mean
the
states
could
never
employ
the
so-called
negative
option
approach
that
was
used
here
whereby
you
file
the
rate,
it
goes
into
effect
unless
the
state
disapproves
it?
it
would
appear
to
me
that
then
you're
suggesting
that
isn't
a
possible--
justice
o'connor
--now,
there's
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
30-some-odd
states
in
this
case
suggesting
there's
no
active
supervision
here.
justice
o'connor
mr.
christie,
are
there
any
states
today
that
use
this
negative
option
approach
for
this
industry?
