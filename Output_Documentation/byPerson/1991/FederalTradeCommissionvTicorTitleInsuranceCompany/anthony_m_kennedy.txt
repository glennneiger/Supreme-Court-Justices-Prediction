justice
kennedy
in
a
close
case
it
seems
to
me
that
the
inquiry
will
be
after
the
fact
of
the
conduct.
that
is
to
say,
the
title
company
has
no
assurance
in
a
close
case
what
resources
the
state
can
or
will
devote
to
reviewing
the
price
fixing
until
after
it's
submitted,
and
yet
the
title
company
has
to
know
at
the
time
that
it
makes
the
submission
or
has
its
meetings
that
the
conduct
is
protected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
the
federal
trade
commission
versus
ticor
title
insurance
company,
the
federal
trade
commission
filed
an
administrative
complaint
against
six
of
the
nation's
largest
title
insurance
companies.
the
allegation
was
horizontal
price
fixing
in
their
fees
for
title
searches
and
title
examinations.
one
company
settled
by
consent
decree
but
the
other
five
firms
continue
to
contest
the
matter.
the
commission
charges
the
title
companies
with
violating
5(a)(1)
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
prohibits
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
or
affecting
commerce.
one
of
the
principal
defenses
the
companies
assert
is
state
action
immunity
from
anti-trust
prosecution
as
contemplated
in
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
parker
versus
brown.
the
commission
rejected
this
defense
and
the
firm
sought
review
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
ruling
that
state
action
immunity
was
available
under
the
state
regulatory
regimes
in
questions,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
commission
sought
certiorari
with
respect
to
the
regulatory
regimes
of
wisconsin,
montana,
connecticut,
and
arizona.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
two
questions:
first,
whether
the
third
circuit
was
correct
in
its
statement
and
application
of
the
state-action
immunity
doctrine;
and
second,
whether
the
third
circuit
erred
by
departing
in
the
findings
of
fact
entered
by
the
administrative
law
judge
and
adapted
by
the
commission.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
first
question
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
under
the
second.
the
preservation
of
the
free
market
and
of
a
system
of
a
free
enterprise
without
price
fixing
or
cartels
is
essential
to
economic
freedom.
continued
enforcement
of
the
national
anti-trust
policy
grants
the
states
more
freedom,
not
less,
in
deciding
whether
to
subject
discrete
parts
of
their
economy
to
additional
regulation
and
controls.
it
was
against
this
background
in
parker
versus
brown
that
we
upheld
a
state-supervised
market
sharing
scheme
against
the
sherman
act
challenge.
we
announce
there
the
doctrine
that
federal
anti-trust
laws
are
subject
to
suppression
by
state
regulatory
programs.
our
decision
was
grounded
in
principles
of
federalism.
our
decision
since
parker,
made
clear
that
active
supervision
of
the
state's
policy
is
required.
the
inquiry
is
not
to
determine
whether
the
state
has
met
some
normative
standard
such
as
efficiency
in
its
regulatory
practice.
its
purpose
is
to
determine
whether
the
state
has
exercised
sufficient
independent
judgment
and
control
so
that
the
details
of
the
rates
or
prices
have
been
established
as
a
product
of
deliberate
state
intervention,
not
simply
by
agreement
among
private
parties.
the
question
is
not
how
well
state
regulation
works
but
whether
the
anti-competitive
scheme
is
the
states'
own.
federalism
serves
to
assign
political
responsibility,
not
to
obscure
it.
neither
federalism
nor
political
responsibility
is
well
served
by
a
rule
that
essential
national
policies
are
displaced
by
state
regulations
intended
to
achieve
more
limited
ends.
for
states
which
do
choose
to
displace
the
free
market
with
regulation,
our
insistence
on
real
compliance
with
the
test
we
have
set
out
will
serve
to
make
clear
that
the
state
is
responsible
for
the
price
fixing,
it
is
sanctioned
and
undertaken
to
control.
where
prices
or
rates
are
set
as
an
initial
matter
by
private
parties
subject
only
to
a
veto
if
the
state
chooses
to
exercise
it,
the
party
claiming
the
immunity
must
show
that
state
officials
have
undertaken
the
necessary
steps
to
determine
the
specifics
of
the
price
fixing
or
rate
setting
scheme.
the
mere
potential
for
state
supervision
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
decision
by
the
state,
and
under
these
standards,
we
conclude
that
there
was
no
active
supervision
in
either
wisconsin
or
montana.
the
administrative
law
judge
found
and
the
commission
agreed
that
in
these
two
states
the
rate
filings
were
checked
at
most
for
mathematical
accuracy.
some
were
unchecked
all
together.
in
montana,
a
rate
filing
became
effective
despite
the
failing
of
the
rating
gear
to
provide
additional
requested
information.
in
wisconsin,
additional
information
was
provided
after
a
lapse
of
seven
years
during
which
time
the
rate
filing
remain
in
effect.
these
findings
are
fatal
to
respondent's
attempts
to
portray
the
state
regulatory
regimes
as
providing
the
necessary
component
of
active
supervision.
the
findings
demonstrate
that
whatever
the
potential
for
state
regulatory
review
in
wisconsin
and
montana,
active
state
supervision
did
not
occur.
neither
of
these
were
expressed,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
the
opportunity
to
reexamine
its
determinations
with
respect
to
the
regulatory
regimes
of
arizona
and
connecticut.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice

and
