justice
white
assume
the
statute
itself
told
the
agency
that
one
of
your
duties
is
to
review
these
rate
filings
to
see
if
you
should
object
to
them,
and
that
they
have
the
staff
to
do
it,
they've
got
the
money
to
do
it
and
the
state
expects
the
agency
to
carry
out
its
duties.
do
you
think
that
you
need
some
more
proof?
justice
white
i
guess
you
do.
justice
white
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
be...
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
you
how
clearly
the
duty
was
spelled
out,
how
well
it
was
funded,
and
how
much
staff
there
was
available.
justice
white
that
certainly
puts
quite
a
gloss
on
what
we've
said
before,
don't
you
think,
that
it
takes
a
specific
action
of
the
state
to
approve
the
price
restraint
that--
justice
white
--that's
a
far
cry
from
saying
they
have
to
approve
them,
expressly
the
price
restraint.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
here
the...
here
the
state
has
got
a
mandatory
scheme
in
its
law
set
up
to
require
examination
and
approval
of
these
rates.
justice
white
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
rule--
justice
white
--the
rule
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
is
precisely
that.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
white
and
the
state
had
no
special
procedure
to
review
those
joint
filings.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
just
single
filings
might
take
one
standard
of
review
and
joint
filings
would
be
a
different
kettle
of
fish,
wouldn't
they?
justice
white
let
me
also...
let
ask
you,
as
long
as
i've
got
you
interrupted,
what
do
you
think
the
court
below
meant
by
the
words
that
the
activity
is
in
place,
staffed
and
funded,
and
shows
some
basic
level
of
activity?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
very
basic
level
of
activity
if
they
just
received
the
rates
and
put
them
in
the
right
folder
without
ever...
without
ever
looking
at
them
in
terms
of
whether
they
were
reasonable
or
whatever
the
standard
was.
justice
white
well,
if
the
state's
policy...
if
you
define
the
state's
policy
as
a
decision
to
permit
noncompetitive
rate-making,
well,
all
you
would
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
these
filed
rates
and
say,
why,
of
course
these
people
have
agreed.
they've
eliminated
competition
among
themselves.
the
rates
obviously
then
are
carrying
out
the
state
policy,
right?
justice
white
that's
with
respect
to
joint
rates
and--
justice
white
in
these
states
that
you
represent,
was
there
some
legislative
explanation
for
why
the
decision
was
made
that
competition
should
not
be
the
rule
among
title
insurance
companies
with
respect
to
examining
titles,
wholly
aside
from
the
insurance?
justice
white
it
may
be
historic
that--
justice
white
--was
there
some
determination
that...
some
explanation
of
why
they
thought
competition
shouldn't
be
the
rule
among
insurance
companies?
justice
white
because
they'd
been
competing?
justice
white
or
why
they
would
draw
this
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
two
companies
went
broke
that
there
shouldn't
be
competition.
justice
white
what
did
the
federal
court
of
appeals
say
about
that,
or
didn't
it
reach
it?
justice
white
was
it
your
position
before
the
commission
that
mccarran-ferguson
protected
you?
justice
white
or
the
title
insurance
companies
needn't
rely
on
the
state
action
doctrine.
justice
white
well,
they
don't
need
both.
i'll
put
it
that
way.
you
could
get
along
either
with
your
state
action
doctrine
or
mccarran-ferguson.
justice
white
that
was
your
position,
i
take
it,
before
the
commission.
