justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question,
mr.
wallace?
i
know
it's
not
an
issue,
or
i
know
the
case
only
involves
the
second
prong
of
this
two-prong
test,
but
what
is
the
state
policy
that
justifies
the
state
program?
is
it
one
to
protect
the
companies
from
bankruptcy,
or
is
it
one
to
prevent
them
from
charging
too
much?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
it's
more
like
the
motor
carrier
act.
justice
stevens
does
the
state
policy
require
all
the
companies
to
join
in
the
joint
program?
justice
stevens
so
that
if
a
big
company
like--
justice
stevens
--security
title
wanted
to
stay
out
it
could
price
independently
and
it
wouldn't
affect
the
state
policy.
justice
stevens
and
in
fact,
are
any
of
these
programs
still
in
existence
or
have
they
all
been
abandoned?
justice
stevens
my
guess
it
probably
wouldn't
work
because
they
couldn't
get
the
biggest
company
to
participate.
justice
stevens
the
reason
i
asked
you
about
the
first
prong,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
judge
whether
there's
been
adequate
supervision
of
carrying
out
the
state
policy,
you
kind
of
ought
to
know
what
the
state
policy
is,
and
i'm
a
little
puzzled
from
the
briefs
as
to
just
what
the
states
are
trying
to
do
here,
other
than
maybe
just
approve
of
a
joint
ratemaking
that
the
companies
wanted
to
get.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
is
there
any
distinction
between
the
rates
for
the...
premiums
for
the
title
insurance
itself
and
the
charges
for
the
title
searches,
of
the
charges?
are
they
both
covered
in
the
same
manner
by
these
rate
agreements--
justice
stevens
--or
proceedings,
i
should
say.
justice
stevens
mr.
christie,
can
i
just
ask
one
factual
question?
were
these
state
agencies...
was
this
the
sole
responsibility
of
the
agency
or
was
this
something
that
they
did
in
addition
to
other
duties?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
the
same
insurance
board,
state
board
that
would
govern
fire
insurance,
life
insurance
and
everything
else.
justice
stevens
this
was
an
additional
duty
for
them.
justice
stevens
that's
the
other
half
of
my
question.
in
most
of
the
insurance
bureaus
i
understand
all
the
insurance
companies
must
have
their
rates
approved,
but
that
was
not
true
in
this
area,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
so
even
a
company
that
did
not
participate
in
joint
ratemaking
would
nevertheless
have
to
file
and
have
its
rates
approved
by
the
same
procedure.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
would
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
be
that
it
could
be
sound
regulatory
practice
to
rely
on
the
market
to
take
care
of
these
fringe
minimum
smaller
filings?
justice
stevens
mr.
christie,
something
just
crossed
my
mind.
maybe
it
doesn't
really
go
to
the
force
of
your
argument,
which
is
very
strong,
but
is
the...
if
your
test
is
correct
and
the
third
circuit's
test
is
correct,
isn't
the
mccarran-ferguson
statute
pretty
much
redundant
now?
justice
stevens
what
i
mean
is...
and
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
absolutely
correct,
but
if
this
is
all
that's
necessary,
i'm
sure
every
insurance
department
throughout
the
country
engages
in
at
least
this
basic
level
of
activity,
so
you
don't
really
need
a
statutory
exemption
because
it
will
be
all
taken
care
of
under
parker
against
brown.
justice
stevens
it
just
suggests
that
maybe
the
southeastern
underwriters
case
was
wrongly
decided.
well,
i
take
it
the
ftc's
position
is
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
furnishes
no
protection
for
what
is
challenged
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
the
only
reason
mccarran-ferguson
doesn't
cover
the
whole
thing
is
that
some
of
the
activities
arguably
are
not
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
stevens
my
hypothetical
earlier
was
assuming,
talking
only
about
the
business
of
insurance,
and
i
think
under
your
analysis,
and
it
may
well
be
right,
we
really
don't
need
the
mccarran-ferguson
amendment
any
more.
justice
stevens
mr.
christie,
may
i
ask...
and
perhaps
this
isn't
a
proper
question,
but
to
what
extent
is
this
still
a
live
issue?
have
these
activities
pretty
well
come
to
a
halt?
