mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court
because
the
standard
of
active
supervision
which
it
utilized
strikes
a
carefully
constructed
balance,
we
submit,
between
the
goals
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws
on
the
one
hand
and
the
principles
of
federalism
which
underlie
state
action.
the
circuit
court
standard
provides
assurance
that
the
states
have
enacted
a
legitimate
regulatory
program
while
leaving
to
the
states
themselves
the
task
of
assuring
its
strictness
or
its
effectiveness.
each
of
the
states
here
had
enacted
a
system
of
regulation
with
agencies
staffed
and
funded
and
charged
with
a
duty
to
assure
that
the
states'
rate
policies
were
adhered
to,
and
over
the
period
of
time
encompassed
by
this
proceeding
these
regulators
had
given
administrative
attention
to
these
bureaus
and
their
filings.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
the
agencies
in
every
case,
justice
stevens,
were
state
insurance
departments.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
they
only
had
to
worry
about
insurance
matters,
but
of
course
they
had
many
lines
of
insurance
in
addition
to
title
insurance.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
if
i
may
respond
as
well
to
your
question
to
mr.
wallace,
justice
stevens,
about
the
underlying
state
policies
that
these
statutes
were
designed
in
effect
to
enforce,
all
of
the
statutes
in
question
required
that
the
rates
be
not
excessive,
inadequate,
or
discriminatory.
those
essentially
set
out
and
the
states
defined
what
they
meant
by
all
those
concepts
what
i
think
the
state
was
worried
about.
they
wanted
the
rates
not
to
be
excessive
because
they
wanted
consumers
to
have
reasonable
rates.
they
were
worried
about
inadequacy
issues.
these
are
insurance
companies,
and
the
states
wanted
to
be
sure
that
a
policyholder,
when
it
comes
time
to
make
a
claim,
has
someone
to
make
a
claim
against,
and
lastly
they
worry
about
discriminatory
practices.
that
is,
is
one
line
of
consumers
being
unfairly
charged
as
opposed
to
another
line.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
in
all
of
these
states,
all
title
insurance
rates
were
required
to
be
filed,
and
you
could
file
them
either
individually
or
you
could
file
them
by
designating
a
license
rating
bureau--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--to
file
them.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
justice
white,
they
had
no
special
procedure,
although
several
regulators
in
the
record
in
this
case
testified
that
they
gave
extra
special
attention
to
rates
filed
by
rating
bureaus.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
the
court
will
recall
justice
powell's
discussion
of
this
in
southern
motor
carriers.
he
discussed
the
utility
of
the
existence
of
rating
bureaus
from
a
regulator's
point
of
view
because
it
allowed
the
regulator
the
efficiencies
of
looking
at
one
filing
rather
than
having
to
confront
multiple
filings
from
separate
companies.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i
think
the
third
circuit
intended
by
those
words
to
suggest
that
it's
appropriate
for
an
antitrust
court
simply
to
confirm
the
seriousness
of
the
state's
intent
to
assure
that
its
policies
were
being
adhered
to
by
looking
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
regulatory
activity
existed.
the
emphasis
is
on,
was
there
an
indication
that
the
regulators
were
in
place,
and
was
there
some
indication
that
they
were
in
fact
acting,
that
they
were...
as
we
put
it
in
our
brief,
that
the
cop
was
on
the
beat.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think...
if
you
intend
by
your
hypothetical,
justice
white,
to
suggest
that...
to
ask
whether
the
third
circuit's
test
is
filed...
is
met
if
the
regulators
do
nothing,
i
would
agree,
i
don't
think
the
third
circuit's
test
would
be
met.
but
if
there
is
some
indication
that
they
have
acted,
and
clearly
the
record
here
amply
supported
their
conclusion,
then
the
third
circuit
says
we
won't
go
any
farther.
that
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
state
has
gone
beyond
just
simply
articulating
an
anticompetitive
policy
and
doing
nothing
more,
the
kind
of
situation
that
this
court
faced
in
midcal.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
the
regulators
are
charged
by
their
statute
to
consider
more.
they
are
charged
to
consider
whether
the
rates
are
excessive,
inadequate,
or
discriminatory.
that's
the
determination
that
the
statutes
give
them
an
obligation
to
consider.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
and
individually
filed
rates.
the
basic
statutory
obligation
on
the
regulator
is
no
different
in
either
case.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
you're
right.
we
think
that
they
misperceive
the
record
in
this
case.
obviously,
it's
the
record
itself
that
demonstrates
whether
or
not
these
states
were
regulating
and
not
the
arguments
of
counsel.
we
think
the
record
here
amply
indicates,
as
we've
laid
out
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
that
the
regulators
in
these
states
looked
at
the
filings,
that
they
asked
questions
about
the
filings,
that
they
asked...
that
they
demanded
that
these
rating
bureaus
provide
increasingly
sophisticated
and
expensive
justifications
for
their
rates,
and
ultimately
the
regulators
approved
the
rates
and
allowed
them
to
become
effective.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i
don't
think,
at
least,
justice
kennedy,
insofar
as
the
record
is
established
here,
that
there's
an
indication
that
the
regulators
participated
in
the
sense
of
sitting
down
with
the
bureau
itself
as
it
determined
what
rates
it
wished
to
file.
what
your
question
does
address,
an
issue
that
is
appropriate,
i
think,
for
the
court
to
consider,
there
obviously...
in
the
course
of
a
regulator's
review
of
a
rate
there
is
a
need
to
look
at
it
when
it
is
first
filed.
there
is
also
the
desirability
of
keeping
some
sense
of
what
the
continuing
impact
of
the
rate
is
over
the
years
the
rate
is
in
effect.
we
think
in
this
case
these
departments
did
both.
they
reviewed
the
rate
when
it
was
filed,
and
they
made
effort
to...
by
demanding
that
the
bureaus
produce
profitability
studies
showing
the
impact
of
the
rate
over
the
years
that
ensued,
they
made
an
effort
to
keep
track
of
the
impact
of
the
rate
in
that
respect
as
well.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
insurance
association
sets
out
at
considerable
length
in
an
appendix
all
of
the
states
classified
by
various
ways
in
which
they
in
effect
allow
rates
to
become
in
effect,
and
their
catalogue
of
what
states
do
suggests
that
the
most
frequently
used
procedure
which
the
states
have
designed
is
the
so-called
demur
or
negative
option
procedure.
this
is
a
procedure,
in
other
words,
not
just
the
brain-child
of
the
legislatures
in
these
four
states
with
respect
to
title
insurance,
but
it
is
used
widely
throughout
many
lines
of
insurance
in
many
states
and
i
think
insofar
as
regulation
of
other
economic
enterprises
is
concerned
as
well.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i
think
from
the
state
legislature's
point
of
view,
the
advantage
is
simply
that
it
doesn't
force
the
insurance
regulator
to
look
at
each
and
every
filing
and
take
the
time
to
make
an
affirmative
determination
that
it
meets
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
because
obviously,
some
filings
are
more
significant
in
terms
of
their
ultimate
impact
on
consumers
than
other
filings.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
think
it
would
be
okay.
if
that's
all
that
the
record
suggested
they
did--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--that
is
true,
but
they
were
making
an
individual
assessment
on
a
filing
by
filing
basis
that
this
filing
doesn't
need
intensive
review
on
our
part
because
it
has
minimal
consumer
impact.
they
weren't
just
setting
a...
i'll
call
it
an
arbitrary
line
below
which
they
wouldn't
look
at
rates.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
these
states...
this
is
within
the
discretion
that
they
give
to
the
regulator.
they
want
the
regulator
to
make
that
kind
of
decision.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
they
don't
want
the
regulator
to
be
forced
to
spend
the
resources
she
has
looking
at
each
and
every
rate.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
third
circuit's...
as
i
read
the
third
circuit's
opinion,
the
basic
level
of
activity
that
they're
looking
for
wouldn't
be
met
in
the
context
of
the
decision
not
to
look
at
any
rates
below--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--well,
i'm
saying
that
if
the
record
shows,
as
you
look
at
all
that
the
state
did,
that
state
regulators
charged
with
a
duty
of
making
sure
that
their
state
statutory
standards
are
met
in
addition
to
that
perform
some
level
of
activity
consistent
with
their
statutory
duty,
that
that
i
suffice...
suggest
is
active
supervision
and
it
would
meet
the
third
circuit
standard.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
justice
stevens,
in
fact
that
was
precisely
the
judgment
that
regulators
in
wisconsin
made
with
respect
to
filings
that
they
considered
minor.
they
scrutinized
very
carefully
the
contents
of
these
filings,
but
they
made
a
judgment
that
they
wouldn't
look
as
intensely
at
rates
underlying
these
filings,
among
other
reasons
because
in
their
experience
there
was
some
competition
among
and
between
title
insurers,
even
title
insurers
who
were
members
of
the
bureau,
with
respect
to
those
rates.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
justice--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--justice
white,
the
insurance
statutes
didn't
distinguish
in
terms
of
the
rate
standard
that
was
to
be
applied
or
the
duties
of
the
regulators
with
respect
to
whether
it
was
that
component
of
the
charge
that
represented
the
search
and
examination
or
that
component
of
the
charge
that
represented
the
charge
for
the
risk.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
legislative
history
that
would
illuminate
this
intent
with
one
exception.
it's
very
clear
that
the
statute
in
arizona
which
for
the
first
time
vested
authority
in
the
state
insurance
department
to
regulate
title
insurance
rates
and
which
also
permitted
rating
bureaus
to
operate
was
done
so
because
two
title
insurance
companies
in
arizona
had
become
insolvent
shortly
before
the
passage
of
the
legislation.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
they
became
insolvent.
it's
very
clear
that--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--well,
they
obviously
were
concerned
about
insurer
insolvency
and
they
felt
it
was
in
the
state's
interests
in
their
wisdom
to
begin
to
regulate
the
rates
for
title
insurance
companies
and
in
that
instance
to
permit
rating
bureaus
to
operate.
we
submit
that
the
type
of
qualitative
analysis
which
permeates
the
federal
trade
commission's
decision
below
is
an
inappropriate
standard
for
active
supervision.
both
the
third
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
in
the
new
england
motor
carriers
case
criticize
the
federal
trade
commission
for
insisting
on
sitting
in
judgment
of
the
strictness
or
effectiveness
of
what
these
states
did
which
became
in
effect
an
overly
intrusive...
an
intrusion
into
the
prerogatives
of
these
states
to
regulate
as
they
see
fit.
we
think
that
their
decision
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent,
which
has
evidenced
a
determination
to
give
the
states
some
breathing
room
to
regulate.
in
southern
motor
carriers
the
court
held
that
the
sherman
act
was
not
designed
to
compromise
a
state's
ability
to
regulate,
and
rejected
a
compulsion
requirement
for
midcal's
prong
one
test.
in
town
of
hallie,
the
court
also
rejected
an
intense
inquiry
into
legislative
intent
as
undermining
the
policies
of
federalism.
in
the
most
recent
state-actioned
opinion,
the
omni
case,
decided
by
this
court
last
term,
the
court
rejected
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
municipal
regulation
of
billboards
was
in
some
way
procedurally
or
substantively
defective
or
deficient.
the
court
also
rejected
a
conspiracy
exception
to
state
action,
suggesting
that
the
probing
into
the
intent
of
a
regulator
was
anathema
to
the
federalism
principles
that
underlie
state
action.
several
of
the
members
of
the
court,
in
questioning
mr.
wallace,
have
expressed
concern
about
the
problems
which
private
parties
would
face
if
the
federal
trade
commission's
analysis
of
active
supervision
became
the
law,
and
indeed
we
submit
that
would
be
a
practical
problem
which
would
cause
the
withdrawal
of
companies
from
otherwise
accepting
this
kind
of
option
just
as
it
caused
these
companies
to
withdraw
from
the
rating
bureaus
in
this
case.
mr.
wallace
suggests
that
to
meet
the
commission's
affirmative
determination
test,
all
a
company
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
in
effect
communicate
with
an
insurance
department
or
in
some
other
fashion
endeavor
to
evaluate
ahead
of
the
fact
what
they
might
do.
i
submit
that
however
cautiously
and
carefully
a
company
considering
entering
into
a
rating
bureau
and
joining
in
a
collective
filing
might
be,
there
just
is
no
way
to
assure
that
ultimately,
whatever
commentary
is
received
in
advance,
the
department
will
act
in
a
way
which
might
satisfy
the
federal
trade
commission.
any
test,
we
submit,
that
leaves
for
later
judicial
assessment
the
quality
of
what
a
regulator
has
done
defies
predictability.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
justice
stevens,
at
least
measured
by
the
commission's
perception
of
the
application
of
the
mccarran
act
here,
you
might
call
it
redundant.
obviously,
however,
they
are
two
different...
they
involve
two
different
issues.
they
are
analyzed
differently.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
certainly...
certainly
as
your
honor
recites
it,
that
kind
of
definition
of
parker
brown
may
in
many
cases
make
it
unnecessary,
if
you
will,
for
an
insurance
company
to
separately
establish
a
mccarran-ferguson
exemption,
but
i
don't
think
that
should
in
any
way
affect
this
court's
analysis
of
either.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
they
said
only
that
they
would
defer
the
issue
because
having
decided
for
the
respondents
on
the
basis--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--absolutely,
justice
white,
because
these
search
and
examination
services
which
title
insurers
conduct,
they
conduct
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
process
of
underwriting
that
they
go
through,
are
necessary
because
it's
through
this
process
that
they
come
to
conclude
what
they're
willing
to
insure
under
the
policy
and
what
they're
not
willing
to
insure
under
the
policy.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
of
course
there
are
some
folks
over
on
the
hill
across
the
street
who
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
white,
i
missed
it.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
in--
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
--that
was
our
position
before
the
commission.
the
commission
determined
that
search
and
examination
services
were
not
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
that
issue
remains
still
unresolved.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
regulation
by
state
law
aspect
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
exemption
has
been
pretty
well
established
to
be
a
test
that
requires
a
court
to
simply
look
at
whether
by
legislation
a
state
has
permitted
or
prohibited
the
activity
in
question.
the
analysis,
of
course,
that
the
third
circuit
took
of
the
active
supervision
issue
here
is
more
elaborate.
it
looks
to
see
whether
by
legislation
regulators
have
and
exercise
the
power
to
review
private
conduct
and
to
disapprove
what
doesn't
comport
with
state
policy.
they
look
to
see
that
the
regulators
have
ample
duty
and
power
under
those
statutes,
and
finally
they
look
to
make
sure,
as
we
put
it,
that
the
cop
is
on
the
beat,
that
these
regulators
are
staffed
and
funded,
and
that
there's
confirmation
that
in
fact
regulation
exists.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
i
think
it
is
less
intrusive
because
it
looks
to
the
existence
as
opposed
to
any
effort
to
assess
the
quality
of
the
regulation.
what
i
would
concede,
as
many
of
our
amici
have
very
forcefully
argued,
that
any
test
that
goes
beyond
looking
to
the
statutory
structure
of
regulation
runs
some
risk
of
lapsing
into
some
sort
of
qualitative
analysis
of
what
is
going
on.
i
also
concede
that
it
lessens
the
possibility
of
certainty
or
predictability
for
private
parties
considering
whether
to
accept
an
option
which
the
state
has
provided
for
them.
however,
if
this
court
believes
that
the
appropriate
test
of
active
supervision
requires
going
to
some
degree
beyond
just
what
the
statutes
say,
i
submit
that
the
third
circuit's
test
is
a
focused
and
deferential
test
that
is
adequately
sensitive
to
the
underlying
principles
of
federalism
and
to
this
court's
precedent.
mr.
john
c.
christie,
jr.
well,
as
i
said
earlier,
justice
stevens,
all
of
these
companies
withdrew
when
the
commission
began
its
investigation.
none
of
the
respondents
to
my
knowledge
today
belongs
to
a
rating
bureau
that
is
actively
filing
rates
with
the
state
official.
frankly,
if
the
commission's
opinion
were
to
stand
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
way
that
some
antitrust
counselor
could
safely
advise
a
client
as
to
whether
it
was
prudent
to
engage
in
a
bureau.
the
third
circuit's
test
i
think
is
a
much
more
realistic
test,
a
more
meaningful
test,
and
even
if
there
remains
some
degree
of
risk
it
is
more
clearly
discernible
in
advance
than
the
commission's
analysis.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
from
the
court,
thank
you
very
much.
