chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-72,
federal
trade
commission
v.
ticor
title
insurance
company.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--aren't
you
getting
into
the
substance
of
the
state
regulation
if
you
go
that
far?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
really
putting
the
title
companies
in
an
extraordinary
position.
they're
trying
to
get
rates
approved,
they
file
them
before
the
insurance
commission
or
whoever
it
is
in
phoenix
or
whatever
city,
the
insurance
commission
indicates
approval,
and
the
attorney
is
supposed
to
call
them
up
and
ask
them
did
you
really
mean
to
approve
it?
that's
a
strange
burden
to
put
on
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
would
they
go
about
finding
out
more
about...
i
take
it
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
they
interrogate
the
people
responsible
for
the
decision
as
to
how
the
decision
in
that
particular
case
was
reached?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
would
be
another
way?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
patrick
against
burget
the
state
authority
had
no
authority
to
review
at
all
the
actions
of
the
private
authority,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wallace,
you
say
reviewing
the
rate
itself,
which
is
what
you
say
should
be
done,
and
yet
you
said
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
scalia,
i
believe,
that
a
certificate
or
an
order
signed
by
a
majority
of
the
commissioners
saying
we
have
reviewed
the
rate
and
find
it
conforms
to
the
state
policy
would
not
be
conclusive.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
conclusive?
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
you're
dealing
with
something
that
usually
is
a
question
of
fact
in
every
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's
no
presumption
of
regularity
given
to
administrative
proceedings,
so
that
ordinarily
turns
those
things
into
more
questions
of
law
than
questions
of
fact.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
christie,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
christie.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
any
one
of
these
states
could
change
its
policy
without
any
leave
from
this
court
and
beef
up
its
regulatory
process,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-72,
federal
trade
commission
versus
ticor
title
insurance
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
