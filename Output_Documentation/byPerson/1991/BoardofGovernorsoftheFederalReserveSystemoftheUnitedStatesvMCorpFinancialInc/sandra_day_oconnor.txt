justice
o'connor
mr.
minear,
could
i
ask
you
whether
under
fisa
the
board
is
ever
able
to
compel
the
bank
holding
company
to
spend
its
assets
to
take
care
of
the
subsidiary
banks
before
an
article
iii
court
has
had
a
chance
to
review
the
board's
order?
justice
o'connor
is
it
possible
under
the
law
that
the
board
can
compel
that
transfer
of
assets
before
a
court
has
had
a
chance
to
review
it?
justice
o'connor
it's
immediately
subject
to
appeal
and
judicial
review.
justice
o'connor
and
the
minute
that
happens,
is
it
also
theoretically
possible
then,
that
a
bankruptcy
court
could
have
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
wouldn't
you
then
get
the
priority
section
under
the
bankruptcy
code
if
somebody
went
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
said,
look,
now
we're
here,
and
couldn't
they
apply
their
jurisdiction
at
that
stage?
justice
o'connor
it
could
happen,
presumably.
justice
o'connor
no,
no,
no,
no.
that
you
could
have
this
overlapping
jurisdiction
in
a
given
situation,
if
the
funds
were
ordered
transferred.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
there
are
any
limits
on
the
authority
of
the
board
to
determine
what's
an
unsound
banking
practice
and
to
the
relief
that
it
can
order?
justice
o'connor
and
has
the
board
been
consistent
in
its
view
of
its
power?
justice
o'connor
mr.
minear,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
first
point,
the
jurisdictional
argument,
is
it
necessary
for
us
to
go
ahead
and
address
this
second
question?
justice
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
think
that
the
bankruptcy
law
that
speaks
of
what
court
shall
have
exclusive
or
concurrent
jurisdiction
doesn't
apply
to
ongoing
administrative
proceedings
in
an
agency
such
as
this
board,
and
so
that
we
think
that
section
simply
is
inapplicable.
now
suppose
that's
the
situation,
then
where
are
you
with
regard
to
enforcement
of
the
temporary
order
that
says
go
ahead
and
pay
all
your
assets
over.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
automatic
stay,
though,
i
assume,
presupposes
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
some
jurisdiction.
justice
o'connor
and
maybe
it
doesn't
here
of
a
case
where
there's
no
final
administrative
order.
justice
o'connor
yeah,
but
i
think
it
presupposes
a
bankruptcy
court
with
jurisdiction.
and
perhaps
that
isn't
what
we
have
here.
