mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
the
federal
reserve
board's
attempts
to
regulate
mcorp,
a
texas-based
bank
holding
company
that
is
operating
in
bankruptcy
as
debtor
in
possession.
the
basic
issue
is
whether
a
district
court
sitting
in
bankruptcy
may
enjoin
the
federal
reserve
board
from
conducting
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
mcorp
is
engaging
in
unsafe
and
unsound
practices.
that
issue
turns
on
the
meaning
of
section
1818
of
the
financial
institutions
supervisory
act,
also
known
as
fisa.
section
1818,
subsection
(b),
provides
that
the
federal
reserve
board
may
initiate
a
proceeding
like
the
one
involved
here
to
investigate
a
bank
holding
company's
practices
and
to
issue,
if
necessary,
a
cease-and-desist
order.
subsection
(h)
further
provides
that
an
aggrieved
party
make
seek
judicial
review
of
any
such
order
accord...
in
accordance
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
subsection
(i)
then
states
as
follows,
and
i
quote,
"except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section,
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
affect,
by
injunction
or
otherwise,
the
issuance
or
enforcement
of
any
notice
or
order
under
this
section,
or
to
review,
modify,
suspend,
terminate,
or
set
aside
any
such
notice
or
order.
"
we
submit
that
section
1818(i)
means
what
it
says,
and
it
prohibits
any
court,
including
a
district
court
sitting
in
bankruptcy,
from
interfering
with
the
board's
ongoing
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor,
the
bankruptcy
code
does
provide
an
automatic
stay.
it
also
provides
an
exception
to
the
automatic
stay.
and
if
i
may
read
that
to
you
as
well,
i
think
it
clarifies
the
stay
is
not
applicable
here.
it
states
that
the
automatic
stay
does
not
apply
to,
and
i
quote,
"the
commencement
or
continuation
of
any
action
or
proceeding
by
governmental
unit
to
enforce
such
governmental
unit's
police
or
regulatory
power.
"
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it
certainly
applies
to
an
action
to
cease
and
desist
an
unlawful
practice,
and
that
is
what
the
board
has
asserted
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
it
did
not
even
reach
that
issue,
and
it
rejected
all
of
mcorp's
bankruptcy
allegations.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
fact,
largely
agreed
with
our
construction
of
section
1818(i),
that
it
would
prohibit
any
such
proceeding
in
the
bankruptcy
court
in
accordance
with
bankruptcy
law.
it
further
held,
however,
that
this
court's
decision
in
leedom
v.
kyne,
provided
the
court
with
inherent
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
board's
proceedings.
now
we
have
petitioned
this
court
to
review
the
leedom
holding,
while
mcorp
has
petitioned
on
the
bankruptcy
law
issues.
and
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
question
of
leedom,
which
has
been
a
continuing
source
of
confusion
for
the
lower
courts.
leedom
arose
out
of
a
dispute
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
over
a
certification
of
a
bargaining
unit
for
certain
westinghouse
professional
employees.
the
labor
act
did
not
expressly
provide
for
judicial
review
under
the
facts
of
that
case.
this
court
held,
however,
that
a
judicial
review
action
could
proceed
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
any
particular
judicial
proceeding
that
was
specified
by
statute.
it
reasoned
that
a
cause
of
action
could
be
inferred
because
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
under
the
specific
facts
there
would
amount
to
the
obliteration
of
congressionally
conferred
right.
this
court
has
described
leedom
as
a
narrow
and
painstakingly
delimitated
decision.
and
whatever
the
wisdom
of
leedom
under
its
specific
facts,
it
has
no
application
to
a
case
such
as
this.
first,
here,
unlike
in
leedom,
there
has
been
no
agency
decision.
rather,
this
case
is
like
ftc
v.
standard
oil.
the
agency
has
simply
begun
the
process
of
making
its
decision
by
providing
a
notice
of
charges.
second,
and
again
unlike
in
leedom,
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
an
aggrieved
party
will
be
entitled
to
judicial
review
once
the
agency
actually
makes
its
decision.
and
third,
again
unlike
in
leedom,
congress
has
expressly
foreclosed
all
other
judicial
remedies.
in
short,
congress
has
carefully
considered
the
question
of
appropriate
judicial
relief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
has
it
ever
done
so
or
can
it
do
so?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
could
issue
an
order,
but
that
order
would
immediately
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
the
board--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
point
might
be
debatable.
one
point,
to
clarify
as
to
the
first
point
that
you
made.
the...
an
order
from
the
board
will
not
be
effective
for
30
days
from
the
point
of
issuance,
so
that
provides
a
30-day
window
to
seek
judicial
relief.
the
second
question
you
raised
was
whether
a
bankruptcy
court
would
be
able
to
review
that.
under
fisa
section
1818(h),
a
court
of
appeals
is
vested
with
the
jurisdiction
to
review
the
orders
of
the
board.
i
suppose
it's
a
possible
argument
that
the
bankruptcy
court
might
have
authority
to
review
it
under
1334(b).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
claim
in
bankruptcy
as
you
might...
arise
from
a
debtor.
mcorp
is
not
being
obligated
to
pay
any
money
at
all
to
the
federal
reserve
board.
rather,
it's
been
required--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
mcorp
could
be
required
to
pay
money
to
the
fed?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
could
be
that
there
would
be
overlapping
jurisdiction
at
some
point,
but
i
think
that
question,
of
course,
is
premature
here.
all
we
seek
to
do
is
go
forward
with
our
proceeding.
i
think
it's
a
debatable
point
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
would,
in
fact,
have...
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
that
situation.
it
would
depend
in
part
on
whether
the
order
affected...
was
related
to,
the
case...
a
case
under
title
xi,
i
think.
and
it
would
also
depend
on
the
scope
with
the
preclusive
effect
of
section
1818(i).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
certainly
there
are
limits,
but
nevertheless,
congress
has
not
defined
that
term.
and
the
board
is
entitled
to
make
a
reasonable
judgment
on
this,
and
its
views
are
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
on
this
particular
question,
yes
it
has.
as
with
respect
to
unsafe
and
unsound
practices,
that
opens
up
a
broad
array
of
possible
forms
of
mismanagement
that
might
arise.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
1334(d)
gives
the
bankruptcy
court
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
property
of
the
debtor.
again,
we
have
to
speculate
here
on
what
might
happen,
if
i
can
follow
the
course
that
you've
laid
out.
if
the
order
has
been
approved,
the
first
thing...
has
been
subject
of
judicial
review
and
has
been
upheld,
the
first
question
would
be
the
content
of
that
order.
now
it
might
be
that
the
order
will
simply
direct
mcorp
to
put
together
a
plan
for
providing
capital
to
its
subsidiary
banks.
if
mcorp
is
subject
to
such
an
order,
i
assume
that
it
would
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
seek
such
relief,
that
this
is
outside
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
mcorp
could
provide
money
to
its
subsidiaries,
provided
it
falls
within
363(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
it's
a
matter
within
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
assuming
it's
not,
mcorp
would
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
seek
approval
of
its
plan
to
comply
with
the
board's
order.
but
the
board's
order
should
simply
be
treated
as
a
law
that
mcorp
has
to
apply...
has
to
comply
with.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
midlantic
national
bank
case,
simply
being
a
debtor
in
possession
does
not
exempt
you
from
other
regulatory
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
and
there
are
cases
such
as
nathanson
v.
nlrb,
which
is
a
pre-code
case,
which
indicates
that
the
bankruptcy
court
should
defer
to
the
agency
in
terms
of
even
liquidating
back
pay
agreements.
now,
of
course,
that's
far
down
stream
from
where
we
are
right
now.
our
question
is
just
whether
the
board
should
be
allowed
to
go
forward
with
its
proceeding
in
this
case.
the
board
has
been
completely
stymied
in
even
going
forward
with
its
administrative
proceeding
here.
now
as
i
was
saying,
congress
has
carefully
considered
the
question
of
appropriate
judicial
relief
in
this
case,
and
that
clearly
distinguishes
this
case
from
leedom.
congress
has
provided
that
mcorp
will
have
full
opportunity
to
seek
judicial
review
of
the
board's
action
once
the
board
definitively
acts.
at
the
same
time,
congress
has
been
quite
express
and
explicit
in
stating
that
mcorp
has
no
right
to
review
at
all
until
the
board
completes
its
administrative
investigation
and
determines
whether
it
will
issue
an
order.
now,
no
such
order
has
issued
here.
the
board
has
simply
filed
a
notice
of
charges.
that's
all
that
is
issue...
is
at
issue.
as
a
result
of
the
lower
court's
injunction,
however,
there
is
no
administrative
record,
there
has
been
no
administrative
proceeding,
and
it's
unclear
at
this
point
what
action
the
board
might
take.
mcorp
really
makes
no
serious
attempt
to
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
leedom
rationale.
in
fact,
its
brief
it
devotes
a
mere
two
paragraphs
to
the
leedom
question.
mcorp
argues
instead
that
section
1818's
limitations
do
not
apply
in
the
bankruptcy
context.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
that
is
simply
not
so.
it
is
important
to
recall
the
precise
language
of
section
1818(i):
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section,
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
board's
ongoing
proceedings.
that
provision
contains
no
exception
for
bankruptcy
courts,
and
the
bankruptcy
law
itself
contains
no
such
exception.
now
as
i
mentioned
before,
mcorp
has
attempted
to
find
an
exemption
in
the
bankruptcy
code's
automatic
stay
provision.
however,
that
stay
is
subject
to
an
exception
itself,
and
that
exception
precisely
mirrors
section
1818(i).
it
allows
the
actions
of
the
board
to
go
forward,
notwithstanding
the
bankruptcy
action,
and
it
prohibits
the
court
from...
in
effect
from
enjoining
that
type
of
action.
it's
important
to
remember
also
that
the
board
initiated
the
proceeding
here
to
determine
when...
whether
mcorp,
which
continues
to
function
as
a
bank
holding
company,
is
in
violation
of
the
safety
and
soundness
requirements
of
the
board.
and
as
i
stated
before,
the
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition,
in
the
court...
this
court's
words,
does
not
give
a
debtor
in
possession
carte
blanche
to
ignore
regulatory
requirements.
here
mcorp
has
elected
to
continue
in
operation
and
continue
to
own
banks
and
continue
to
operate
banks.
thus
the
need
for
board
oversight
remains.
as
long
as
mcorp
continues
such
operations,
it
should
be
subject
to
the
same
regulatory
requirements
that
apply
to
any
other
bank
holding
company
in
operation.
mcorp
also...
attempts
to
find
an
exception
to
section
1818(i)
in
the
jurisdictional
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
set
forth
at
28
u.s.c.
1334.
the
particular
provision
that
mcorp
relies
on,
however,
does
not
continue
the
exception
to
section
1818(i).
it's
no
different
than
any
of
title
xxviii's
other
jurisdictional
provisions.
they
are
all
subject
to
section
1818(i)
of
fisa.
mcorp
relies
on
the
fact
that
28
u.s.c.
1334(b)
gives
a
bankruptcy
court
jurisdiction
over
civil
proceedings
related
to
a
bankruptcy
case.
but
that
argument
really
takes
mcorp
nowhere.
as
an
initial
matter,
all
that's
at
issue
here
are
administrative
proceedings.
section
1334(b)
does
not
speak
to
those.
second,
congress
has
specified
exactly
what
civil
proceeding
is
available
for
challenging
the
board's
order.
and
as
i
have
explained,
that
is
the
petition
for
judicial
review
under
section
1818(h).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
what
is
the
civil
proceeding,
justice
scalia?
that
is
the
civil
proceeding
that
congress
has
provided
in
section
1818(h),
which
is
a
petition
for
judicial
review
of
a
final
order.
there's
no
final
order
in
this
case.
so
you
have
jurisdiction,
but
you
don't
have
a
cause
of
action.
that's
really
the
problem
here,
at
least
under
your
theory
under
here...
under
your
theory
of
1334(b)
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
there
has
to
be
a
cause
of
action
against
the
government
somewhere.
i
mean,
that
was
the...
that
is
one
of
the
principal
criticisms
of
leedom,
that
it
has
inferred
a
cause
of
action
against
the
government.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
once
the
agency
acts.
and
again,
this
mirrors
the
apa
as
well.
there
is
generally
no
cause
of
action
until
there
is
final
agency
action.
so
again
you
see
under
our
theory
all
the
pieces
fit
together
quite
nicely.
now
mcorp
has
also
asserted
that
jurisdiction
exists
under
28
u.s.c.
1334(d),
the
exclusive...
which
provides
jurisdiction
over
property.
and
as
justice
kennedy
inquired,
the
question
there
is
whether
there
is
any
effect
on
property
at
this
stage.
and
clearly,
there
is
not.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
this
fact
as
well
at
page
20
and
25
of
its
opinion,
joint
appendix
pages
20
and
25.
the
mere
commencement
and
continuation
of
an
administrative
proceeding
has
no
effect
on
property.
any
effects
on
property
will
depend
on
what
the
content
of
the
order
that
is
issued
ultimately
contains.
in
short,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
ruled
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
grants
a
district
court
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
board's
ongoing
proceeding.
section
1818(i)
provides
that
no
court
shall
have
that
power,
and
there's
no
basis
for
making
exception
in
the
case
of
bankruptcy
courts.
that
conclusion
gives
effect
to
the
plain
language
of
section
1818(i)
and
avoids
an
inferred
repeal
of
congress'
expressed
and
unqualified
command.
moreover,
our
position
really
imposes
no
hardship
on
mcorp
as
well.
if
the
court
adopts
our
position,
the
injunction
will
be
lifted;
the
board's
proceeding
will
go
forward.
if
the
board
concludes
that
a
remedy
is
warranted,
it
may
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order,
and
at
that
point,
mcorp
may
obtain
judicial
review.
thus,
the
only
hardship
that
mcorp
faces
here
is
the
obligation
to
participate
in
the
board's
hearing.
and
as
this
court
stated
in
ftc
v.
standard
oil,
that
is
no
legally
cognizable
harm.
it
is
simply
part
of
the
social
burden
of
living
under
government.
if
this
court
agrees
with
our
submission
that
the
courts
below
lack
jurisdiction
to
interfere
with
the
board's
ongoing
proceedings,
then
there
is
no
occasion
to
address
the
remaining
question
in
this
case:
whether
the
board
has
statutory
authority
to
apply
its
source
of
strength
as
it
relates
to
the
facts
here.
indeed,
you'll
face
that
issue
only
if
you
adopt
the
court
of
appeals'
leedom
analysis.
we
think
you
should
not
follow
that
course.
but
if
you
do,
then
you
should
decide
the
source-of-strength
issue
in
favor
of
the
board.
the
board
is
certainly
justified
in
treating
mcorp's
failure
to
contribute
capital
as
an
unsafe
or
unsound
practice
under
the
facts
alleged
in
the
notice
of
charges
here.
as
this
court
recognized
in
its
lincolnwood
decision,
the
board
has
long
recognized
and
frequently
reiterated
that
bank
holding
companies
should
be
a
source
of
strength
to
subsidiary
financial
institutions.
mcorp
has
not
challenged
the
facial
validity
of
that
regulation.
the
question
instead
is
whether
mcorp's
failure
to
comply
with
that
regulation
is
an
unsafe
or
unsound
practice
under
fisa
in
the
particular
circumstances
that
are
presented
there.
now
fisa
does
not
define
the
term
"unsafe
or
unsound
practice",
and
the
question
is
whether
the
board's
interpretation
of
that
term
is
reasonable.
here
the
board
has
reasonably
concluded
that
a
bank
holding
company's
failure
to
provide
financial
support
to
its
bank
subsidiaries
when
it
is
able
to
do
so
can
be
a
form
of
mismanagement
that
threatens
the
financial
well-being
of
the
holding
company,
its
subsidiary,
and
the
public.
first
the
holding
company's
failure
to
act
as...
failure
to
support
or
refusal
to
support
in
this
case
its
subsidiary
banks
can
result
in
the
wasting
of
an
asset.
if
mcorp's
subsidiary
banks
collapse
because
of
an
absence
of
adequate
capital,
the
holding
company's
own
balance
sheet
will
be
affected.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
absolutely
not.
no.
and
in
fact,
that
issue
would
not...
the
only
way
this
issue
arises
is
if
you
adopt
the
leedom
analysis.
on
that
basis,
i
think
that...
you
know,
i
can
restrict
my
comments
with
respect
to
the
source-of-strength
policy.
as
i
said,
it
can
be
an
unsafe
or
unsound
practice
to
refuse
to
supply
capital
to
subsidiary
banks
because
it
can
waste
the
holding
company's
own
assets.
it
can
also
result
in
a
run
on
the
holding
company's
other
banks
if
the
public
is
under
the
perception
that
a
whole...
holding
company
stands
behind
its
subsidiary
banks.
and
finally,
of
course,
the
public
bears
the
cost
of
any
of
these
types
of
failures
through
the
provision
of
fdic
insurance
and
access
to
the
fed's
credit
window.
thus,
it's
quite
reasonable
for
the
fed
to
treat
a
bank
holding
company's
refusal
to
aid
its
subsidiary
banks
as
an...
or
to
treat
it
as
an
unsafe
or
unsound
practice
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
lower
court's
injunction
has
prevented
the
board
from
conducting
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
we
think
the
better
course
here
is
to
reject
the
lower
court's
leedom
analysis
and
allow
the
administrative
proceeding
to
go
forward.
but
if
the
court
decides
to
reach
the
source-of-strength
issue,
it
should
decide
it
in
the
board's
favor.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
this
question
of
the
temporary
cease-and-desist
order,
since
it's
been
raised
again.
this
is
something
that
we
addressed
in
a
supplemental
brief
in
response
to
mcorp's
supplemental
brief.
as
an
initial
matter,
these
three
temporary
cease-and-desist
orders
are
all
the
subject
of
a
pending
judicial
action
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
the
complaint
is
set
forth
at
page
174
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
if
you
lift
the
injunction
in
this
case,
then
it
will
then
turn
to
that
judicial
action
in
turn
of
the
status
of
the
temporary
orders.
it's
our
belief
that
the
continued
viability
of
these
order
3
years
later
is
open
to
question.
in
the
earlier
proceeding,
mcorp
itself
had
raised
that
point.
at
116
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
make
the
argument
that
these
temporary
orders
are
in
fact
moot.
they
might
well
be.
and
that
is
something
that
could
be
determined
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
in
the
judicial
proceeding
that
they
had
filed,
a
separate
judicial
proceeding.
additionally,
i'd
like
to
touch
upon
this
question
of
the
title
of
the
board's
action
of
eviscerating
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--two
of
the
orders
are
outstanding,
but
we
think
that
they
are
in
effect,
or
their
effect
is
questionable
because
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
there
is
a
judicial
action
to
challenge
them,
but
nothing
has
gone
forward
because
the
stay
that's
in
effect
in
this
case
has
prevented
anything
from
going
forward.
the
board
might
take
some
action
to
withdraw
those
temporary
orders,
but
it
can't
do
anything
until
we
resolve
this
proceeding
first.
with
respect...
those
two
are...
to
get
into
the
details
of
this,
one
order
provided
that
mcorp
would
not
pay
any
dividends.
the
bankruptcy
court
has
stayed
that,
the
payment
of
dividends,
as
well.
the
second
order
prohibited
any
extraordinary
disbursements
or
expenditures,
such
as
bonuses
to
management.
we
believe
the
bankruptcy
court
will
prevent
that
from
taking
place
as
well,
so
the
orders,
in
effect,
have
no
practical
effect
at
this
point.
the
third
order
concerned
the
source-of-strength
proceeding.
and
as
we
explain
in
our
supplemental
brief,
the
board
has
suspended
the
operation
of
that
temporary
order.
and
the
language
that
mr.
miller
quotes
concerning
the
second
amended
notice
of
charges
that
preserves
the
status
of
the
temporary
orders,
it
preserves
the
status
of
that
order
as
being
suspended.
so
in
effect,
these
temporary
orders
are
just
not
a
part
of
the
case.
that's
simply
a
red
herring
that
i
think
that
mcorp
has
raised.
with
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
being
eviscerated
by
the
board's
challenges,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
our
second
amended
notice
of
charges,
the
amount
of
capitalization
that
we
indicated
we
felt
would
be
necessary
with
respect
to
four
of
the
five
remaining
banks
was
$21
million.
mcorp
has
asserted
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
that
it
has
assets
of
1.5
billion.
so
i
think
that
there's...
you
know,
a
difficulty
with
that,
the
argument
that
they
make
here
on
that
point.
concerning
the
long
process
that
would
be
involved
here,
according
to
the
stipulation
of
our
proffer
of
facts
that
mcorp
offered,
the
hearing
before
the
board
would
take
3
days
on
the
part
of
the
board
and
3
days
on
the
part
of
mcorp.
if
this
proceeding
had
gone
forward
as
planned,
it
would
have
been
completed
long
before
this.
reorganization
would
be
completed.
as
far
as
the
record
deficiencies,
i
think
that
that
is
quite
true
that
there
are
deficiencies
in
the
record.
and
the
very
reason
there
are
deficiencies
in
the
record
here
is
because
of
the
injunction
that
has
prohibited
any
evidentiary
hearing
to
flush
out
a
lot
of
the
allegations
that
mr.
miller
is
making
at
this
point.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
extraordinary
relief
here,
i
think
that
the
question
of
relief
is
something
that
we'll
just
have
to
wait
for
the
ongoing
proceeding
to
determine.
the
important
point
is
to
remember
again,
section
1818(i),
which
provides
that
no
court
may
take
any
action
to
enjoin
the
board's
proceedings
except
in
accordance
with
that
section.
that
is
the
matter
that's
at
issue
here.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
