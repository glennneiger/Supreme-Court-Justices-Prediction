justice
scalia
but
the
attempt
to
review
the
propriety
of
that
administrative
proceeding
is
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
scalia
so
you
are
within
1334(b).
it
is
a
civil
proceeding
related
to
a
case
under
title
xi.
justice
scalia
so
your
argument
is
not
an
argument
of
one
statute's
superseding
the
other,
but
just
of
no
cause
of
action
here,
at
this
stage,
essentially.
justice
scalia
doesn't
this
get
you
back
into
a
sort
of
leedom
kind
of
analysis?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--type
of
analysis.
you're
saying
that
there's
no
proceeding
under
this
section
if
the
proceeding
is
not
proper
under
the
section.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
that's
what
the
statute
means?
justice
scalia
i
think
the
delay
is
really
the
only
problem,
mr.
miller,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
standard
of
review
is
going
to
be
exactly
the
same.
it
isn't
just
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
says
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law.
i
mean,
if
it
is
a
violation
of
law,
it's
a
violation
of
law.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
minear,
before
you
go
on,
you
acknowledge
those
orders
are
outstanding
or
you
do
not?
