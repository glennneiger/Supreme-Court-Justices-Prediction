justice
kennedy
you
want
to
get
leedom,
but
while
we're
on
justice
o'connor's
question,
assume
that
the
board
conducts
its
proceedings,
issues
its
orders,
and
there
is
then
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
which
ratifies
the
board's
order.
at
that
point,
there
is
an
order
to
mcorp
to
transfer
property
to
subsidiary
banks.
at
that
point
does
1334(d)
come
into
effect
so
that
the
bankruptcy
court
then
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
propriety
of
that
order
transferring
property?
justice
kennedy
and
i
take
it
works
that
way
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
if
a
bankrupt
is
subject
to
an
nlrb
action,
it
simply
goes
to
the
circuit
court,
the
nlrb
is
either...
if
the
nlrb
is
affirmed,
then
any
property
transfer
is
under
the
control
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
is
simply
bound
by
that
decree.
justice
kennedy
excuse
me.
what
we
have
here
immediately
is
an
administrative
proceeding,
right?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
had
thought,
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
in
any
entity
subject
to
one
of
these
orders
has
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
and
that
only
the
circuit
court's
order
makes
it
enforceable.
please
correct
me
if
that's
wrong.
justice
kennedy
but
i
still
take
it
that
the
entity
mcorp
is
under
no
obligation
to
make
an
actual
transfer
of
proceeds
until
the
circuit
court
affirms
the
order
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear,
is
mcorp
entitled
to
have
a
stay
of
that
order
pending
its
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
kennedy
all
right,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
come
and
you
say,
oh,
all
these
assets
are
being
transferred
out
of
mcorp.
that
just
isn't
happening
because
the
court
of
appeal's
review
stays
it.
justice
kennedy
now
let
me
just
understand.
so
you're
now...
you're
saying
that
as
of
now,
debts
are
being
paid
and
properties
are
being
transferred
quite
beyond
the
control
or
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
stay.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
one
question.
during
the
pendency
of
these
proceedings,
has
mcorp
divested
itself
of
any
of
the
banks
in
question?
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
remaining
five?
justice
kennedy
which
one
is
that?
justice
kennedy
and
that
keeps
the
proceeding
live
in
the
federal
reserve
board
as
to
that
bank?
