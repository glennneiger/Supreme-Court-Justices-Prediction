justice

i
gather
you're
also
telling
us
the
board
hasn't
tried
to
enforce
that
order,
that
letter.
justice
stevens
it
never
did
try
to.
so
that
really
isn't
an
issue
before
us,
is
it?
justice
stevens
you
also
couldn't
pay
your
lawyers.
justice
stevens
but
you
are
paying
your
lawyers.
justice
stevens
and
is
the
validity
of
that
stay
what
we're
reviewing
now?
justice
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
two
cases
come
to
us
on
cross-petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
arise
out
of
two
separate
administrative
proceedings
brought
by
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system
against
a
bank
holding
company.
in
no.
90-913,
there
is
a
challenge
to
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
proceedings
challenging
the
board's
so-called
source
of
strength
regulation.
and
the
cross-petition
challenges
that
court's
holding
that
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
an
administrative
proceeding
alleging
a
violation
of
section
23a
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
i
am
sure
all
of
this
is
perfectly
clear
to
you.
based
on
our
interpretation
of
the
financial
institutions
supervisory
act
in
the
relevant
precedents,
we
hold
that
the
bankruptcy
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
either
proceeding.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
in
one
case
and
affirmed
in
the
other.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
