justice

we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-913,
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system
of
the
united
states
v.
mcorp
financial,
inc.--
mr.
minear,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
lower
court's
ruling
was
not
based
on
the
automatic
stay
provision.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
miller,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
miller,
the
completion
of
the
administrative
hearing
here
without
any
enforcement
beyond
that
won't
remove
any
property
from
the
holding
company,
will
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that
order
enforceable
against
mcorp
without
any
further
proceedings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
did
the
court
of
appeals
view
these
orders
that
you've
just
quoted
the
same
way
you
did
or
you
do?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
we
grant
certiorari
on
certain
cases,
and
as
justice
white
says,
we're
not
interested
in
having
what
we
think
is
a
case
turn
into
a
noncase,
that
just
goes
off
on
facts
that
either
we
weren't
aware
of
or
the
court
of
appeals
below
didn't
consider.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
went
into
the
bankruptcy
court,
mr.
miller,
when
you
sought
a
stay
in
the
district
court,
did
you
rely
on
the
automatic
stay
provisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
would
mean
you
would
have
some
sort
of
a
merits
inquiry
with
respect
to
every
regulatory
investigation
that
was
being
undertaken
by
the
government.
you
would
say
this
exception
doesn't
apply
unless
there
is
authority
for
the
government
agency
to
conduct
this
sort
of
regulation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
calculated
to
lead,
mr.
miller,
but
reading
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
here,
(2)(a)
and
<three
a@l>
[=
(3)(a)]
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
feel
it
was
presented
with
your
temporary
stays
that
might
have
had
the
effect
of
removing...
it's
talking
about
notice
of
charges
and
hearings
that
were
to
be
conducted.
they
didn't
think
there
was
any
prospect
of
property
being
removed
unless
an
order
became
final.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
you're
calling
our
attention
to
in
these
temporary
orders
was
never
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
didn't
consider
them
in
their
opinion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
why
you
had
calculated
to
because
certainly
unless...
until
the
administrative
proceeding
becomes
final
and
is
subject
to
some
sort
of
review,
it
isn't
going
to
have
the
effect
of
removing
any
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
minear,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-913,
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system
versus
mcorp
financial,
inc.
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
