justice
white
now
congress...
suppose
the
district
court
hadn't
done
anything
except
to
say...
except
to
remind
the
board
that
the
statute
says
that
there's
an
automatic
stay
of
all
proceedings.
justice
white
does
that
apply
to
everything
that
the
board
was
doing?
justice
white
well,
at
the
conclusion
of
these
administrative
proceedings
to
which
you
object,
if
there
was
a
final
cease-and-desist
order,
would
that
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
white
and
would
the
validity
of
the
regulation
be
at
issue?
could
it
be
an
issue?
justice
white
so
it's
just
a
question
of
when
you
get
this
adjudication.
justice
white
i
don't
think
that's
a
standard
for
deciding
whether
the
regulation
is
consistent
with
the
statute.
justice
white
a
question
of
statutory
construction
or--
justice
white
--and
why
is
it,
in
a
word,
your
opportunity
for
judicial
review
at
the
end
of
this
proceeding
wouldn't
be
adequate
for
your
purposes?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
you
make
this
argument
whether
any
of
the
assets
of
the
bank
holding
company
are
in
danger
now.
justice
white
it's
just
the
fact...
just
the
fact
that
you...
that
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
being
interfered
with
while
the
administrative
proceeding
going
on?
