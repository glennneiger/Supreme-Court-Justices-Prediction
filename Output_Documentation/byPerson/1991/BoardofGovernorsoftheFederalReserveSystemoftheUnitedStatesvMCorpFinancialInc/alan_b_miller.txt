mr.
alan
b.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
morning
the
government
has
asked
the
court
to
overlook
the
fact
that
by
statute
congress
made
available
to
bank
holding
companies
the
ability
to
take
advantage
of
title
xi
of
the
united
states
code,
that
is
to
say,
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
instead,
based
upon
a
congressional
source
that
the
board
is
unable
to
identify,
the
board
has
suggested
that
the
entire
chapter
11,
proceeding
under
title
xi
may
be
eviscerated
by
the
removal
of
all
of
the
assets
of
the
holding
company
from
the
holding
company
to
the
banks
while
it
is
in
chapter
11
to
leave
the
holding
company
creditors
of
more
than
half
a
billion
dollars
high
and
dry.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
it
will
not.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
the
orders
issued
by
the
board
in
the
fall
of
1988,
and
particularly
the
third
cease-and-desist
order,
which
is
at
pages
84
and
85
of
the
joint
appendix,
go
way
beyond
anything
that
the
government
has
represented
today.
that
order
reads,
and
i
quote,
"mcorp
shall
(a)
take
such
actions
as
are
necessary
to
use
all
of
its
assets
to
provide
capital
support
to
its
subsidiary
banks
in
need
of
capital,
and
(b)
within
15
days
of
the
effective
date
of
this
temporary
order
report
to
the
board
of
governors
on
the
identity
of
those
subsidiary
banks
into
which
capital
injections
will
be
made
by
mcorp
and
the
amount
of
capital
to
be
injected
into
each
such
bank.
"
mr.
alan
b.
miller
it
was,
chief
justice.
paragraph
3
of
that
order
reads,
and
i
quote,
"this
temporary
order
shall
become
effective
immediately
upon
service
on
mcorp
and
shall
remain
in
full
force
and
effect
pending
the
completion
or
termination
of
the
administrative
proceedings
initiated
pursuant
to
the
foregoing
amended
notice,
except.
"
--and
so
forth.
now,
the
position
of
the
board
on
that
issue,
chief
justice,
has
been
that
that
order
was
suspended.
and
indeed,
that
order
was
temporarily
suspended
by
a
letter
that
is
at
pages
184
and
185
of
the
joint
appendix,
dated
november
7,
1988.
but
6
months
later,
the
board,
on
the
24th
of
may,
and
during
the
pendency
of
the
chapter
11
case,
and
this
is
at
page
194
of
the
joint
appendix,
wrote
in
a
notice
of
charges,
"the
provisions
of
this
second
amended
notice
do
not
supersede,
modify,
or
in
any
manner
affect
the
provisions
of
the
notice
of
charges
and
of
hearings
issued
against
mcorp
and
mcorp
management,
dallas,
texas,
by
the
board
of
governors
on
march
30.
"
--and
the
important
part...
"or
the
status
of
the
temporary
orders
issued
on
october
19
and
26,
1988.
"
mr.
alan
b.
miller
i
don't
believe
the
court
of
appeals
considered
them.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
considered
below
an
important
issue.
and
that
was
whether
the
statutory
foundation
for
the
issuance
of
this
order,
that
is
to
say
the
alleged
source-of-strength
doctrine,
exists
and
is
valid
or
whether
no
such
statutory
basis
exist.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
i
believe
it's
almost
right,
justice
kennedy.
in
fact,
temporary
orders
may
be
revoked,
suspended,
or
modified
by
a
district
court.
i
believe
the
right
provision
is
1818(c)(2).
it
is
final
orders
that
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
here,
immediately
after
the
temporary
order
that
i
read
from,
and
one
other...
indeed
two
others
were
issued...
mcorp
before
the
bankruptcy
went
to
the
district
court
for
northern
district
of
texas
under
section
1818(c)(2)
and
sought
immediately
to
have
that
order
revoked,
suspended,
or
modified.
the
letter
that
i
read
to
the
court
represented
an
agreement
by
the
board
of
governors
to
temporarily
suspend
the
temporary
order,
and
that
continued
until
the
bankruptcy
was
filed.
it
was
after
the
bankruptcy
that
the
board,
as
i
read
from
the
notice
of
charges
in
may,
then
said,
that's
really
reinstated.
so
we
have--
mr.
alan
b.
miller
--not
at
all.
it
believe
they
were
as
soon
as
the
suspension...
the
bankruptcy
was
filed
and
the
suspension
was
effectively
lifted
by
the
board.
the
order
that
i
read
you
said
that
it
will
make
all
available
assets
will
be
transferred
to
the
banks.
and
that's
where
the
tension
arises.
and
what
the
board
is
attempting--
mr.
alan
b.
miller
--we
believe
it
was.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
the
board...
the
board
took
the
position
that
the
temporary
order
requiring
the
down-streaming
of
the
assets
was
in
full
force
and
effect.
mcorp
went
into
the
district
court
in
the
chapter
11
case...
actually
went
into
the
bankruptcy
court;
the
board
moved
the
case
up
to
the
district
court...
and
went
into
the
district
court
and
said
this
order
has
no
legitimate
statutory
foundation.
these
temporary
orders
ought
to
be
stayed
immediately.
and
furthermore,
there's
no
purpose
in
going
forward
with
a
permanent
proceeding
because
there
is
no
validity
to
the
source
of
strength.
so
we
do
have
a
very
live
controversy
in
the
bankruptcy
and
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
on
these
issues.
it
is
the
1334(b)
jurisdiction
under
title
xxviii
that
gave
the
bankruptcy
court
as
well
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
northern
district
to
review
the
temporary
orders.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
then,
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
examine
whether
or
not
this
order
to
put
all
the
assets
from
the
holding
company
into
the
banks
has
any...
valid
statutory
source.
otherwise,
there
is
never
an
opportunity
to
review
that
before
the
entire
holding
company
assets
are
eviscerated,
the
chapter
400
or
whatever
million
dollars
have
been
placed
in
them.
it
cannot
be
that
the
court
has
no
power
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
underlying
basis
for
the
government's
assertion
of
the
source
of
strength
has
any
sound
statutory
footing.
indeed,
there
is
as
well
as
it
relates
to
the
temporary
orders,
the
automatic
stay.
i
only
referred
to
one
of
the
temporary
orders
that
are
at
issue
here.
there
is
a
second
temporary
issue
ordered
1
week
earlier.
and
that
also
was
never
suspended
by
the
board
pursuant
to
the
letter
agreement,
never
suspended
by
any
agreement.
that
order
required
that
mcorp
not
dissipate
any
of
its
assets.
dissipation
is
a
term
used
by
the
board
included,
unless
otherwise
accepted,
paying
your
debts.
and
indeed
that
temporary
order
which
is
also
in
the
record,
said
that
mcorp
could
continue
to
pay
debts
previously
contracted
and
it
could
continue
to
pay
salaries...
these
were
exceptions
to
dissipation...
but
it
couldn't
contract
for
any
new
goods
or
any
new
services,
barring
consent
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
dallas.
and
that
order
was
in
full
force
and
effect
when
the
bankruptcy
was
filed.
the
automatic
stay
of
the
bankruptcy
code
prohibits
anyone
from
taking
any
act
to
control
the
assets
of
a
debtor
or
to
obtain
possession.
now
that
is
not
the
section
that
mr.
minear
referred
to.
that
is
section
362(a)(3).
mr.
alan
b.
miller
yes,
it
does,
justice.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
but
the
automatic
stay
is
a
congressional
edict.
it
doesn't
require
an
act
of
a
court
to
exercise
or
put
in
place
the
automatic
stay.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
but
congress
also
gave,
under
1334(d),
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
assets
of
a
debtor
wherever
located
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
obviously,
since
the
1334(d)
was
enacted
in
1984,
it
well
succeeded
the
enactment
of
1818(i).
mr.
alan
b.
miller
yes,
we
did.
i
believe
that
the
record
will
reflect
we
asked
for
two
things.
we
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
automatic
stay
applied,
and
we
asked
for
a
section
105
stay,
which
is
the
bankruptcy
equivalent
of
the
all
ritz
act
against
prosecution.
we
did
so
because
the
automatic
stay
applies
with
regard
to
the...
any
act
to
control
assets
of
the
estate
are
to
obtain
possession
of
the
estate,
and
there
are
no
exemptions
to
that
in
section
362(b),
none
whatsoever.
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
legislative
history
to
section
362(a)
indicates
quite
clearly
that
the
exemptions
relied
upon
by
the
board,
and
maybe
overturned
by
the
bankruptcy
court
in
its
discretion
under
the
authority
granted
under
section
105(a).
it
shifts
the
burden
to
the
debtor
or
other
trustee
to
seek
that
stay,
but
it
does
not
by
virtue
of
section
362(b)
disable
a
chapter
11
debtor
or
a
trustee
from
obtaining
a
stay
under
section
105.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
during
the
chapter
11,
administrative
expenses
may
be
paid
despite
the
temporary
order
of
the
board
of
governors
which
would
say
that
without
their
consent
you
cannot
pay
salaries,
you
cannot
pay
your
lawyers
to
come
to
the
united
states
supreme
court,
you
cannot
pay
anything
without
the
control
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
dallas
being
exercised.
what
we're
saying
is,
yes,
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
title
xxviii
authorizes
the
court
to
administer
the
chapter
11
case
and
to
administer
the
assets
during
the
chapter
11
free
from
interference
with
the
control
over
those
assets
by
the
board
of
governors.
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question,
justice.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
it
couldn't
because,
first--
mr.
alan
b.
miller
--oh,
it
is.
it
is
because
we
cannot...
if
the
board
were
to
have
its
way,
we
could
not
propose
a
plan
of
reorganization
that
would
create
new
indebtedness
because
that
temporary
order
would
be
staring
us
in
the
face.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
that's
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
because
there
is
a
stay
outstanding
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
permits
us
to
carry
on
the
business
of
these
debtors.
but
for
that
stay,
or
for
the
graciousness,
if
you
will,
of
the
board
of
governors,
we
would
be
unable
to
pay
those
obligations,
justice
stevens.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
yes.
because
the
validity
of
that
stay
is
based
on
the
source
of
strength.
the
source
of
strength
is
the
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
orders.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
indeed,
the
temporary
orders
were
first
initiated
as
a
procedure
preliminary
to
the
final
findings
on
the
source-of-strength
doctrine
initiated
by
the
board
of
governors
in
the
fall
of
1988.
now,
we
need
not,
we
think,
rely
merely
on
the
leedom
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
the
analysis
is
sound,
but
more
importantly
we
think
that
statutory
framework
in
which
the
source-of-strength
charges
were
brought,
and
its
counterpoint
with
the
bankruptcy
require
an
examination
by
the
bankruptcy
court
of
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
may
go
forward.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
is
an
automatic
stay
under
section
(a)(1),
and
here
we're
now...
we're
off
the
issue
of
the
temporary
orders,
and
we're
on
to
the
main
proceedings.
and
(a)(1)
prohibits
any
suit
or
proceeding,
including
an
administrative
proceeding,
that
could
have
been
brought
prior
to
a
filing
of
a
petition
from
going
forward.
now,
the
board
relies
upon
the
exemption
in
section
364...
section
362(b)(4),
which
says
that
a
governmental
unit
proceeding
under
section
(a)(1)
to
enforce
its
police
or
regulatory
power
may,
nevertheless,
despite
section
(a)(1),
go
forward
to
the
point
of
judgment
unless
the
judgment
is
a
nonmonetary
judgment.
and
then
under
section
(b)(5)
for
injunctive
relief,
it
may
be
enforced.
the
issue
then
arises,
it
seems
to
us,
for
the
bankruptcy,
or
here,
the
article
iii
district
court,
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
legitimate
police
or
regulatory
power
enforcement
action.
is
there
a
police
power
or
a
regulatory
power
to
be
enforced?
because
if
there
is
not,
then
seemingly
subsection
(a)(1),
the
automatic
stay,
would
apply,
and
at
that
point
the
proceeding
would
be
automatically
stayed.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
we
believe
that
in
a
bankruptcy,
where
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
is
one
that
is
calculated
to
lead
to
the
removal
of
the
assets
of
a
holding
company,
yes,
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
necessarily
must
examine
whether
there
is
a
police
or
regulatory
power,
chief
justice.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
no,
it
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
they
didn't
refer
to
it.
and
i
was
not
just
now
referring
to
the
temporary
orders.
i
was
referring
to
the
notice
of
charges
that
your
honor--
mr.
alan
b.
miller
--that
is
correct.
without
the
temporary
orders,
obviously.
but
here,
we
have
a
chapter
11
case
effectively
being
held
hostage
to
the
long
process
of
the
administrative
proceeding
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
source
of
strength.
we're
not
just
in
the
administrative
proceeding
going
to
get
into
is
there
a
statutory
basis.
we're
now
going
to
get
into,
during
these
proceedings,
what
are
the
needs
of
the
banks,
what
are
the
capital
of
the
banks,
how
much
is
it
going
to
be
going
forward
and
backwards.
it's
going
to
be
a
long
and
difficult
proceeding.
and
as
this
court,
we
believe,
urged
in
timbers,
the
job
in
the
chapter
11
is
to
get
on
with
it,
not
to
prejudice
the
creditors
who
are
creditors
of
the
holding
company,
be
they
secured
or
unsecured,
by
a
long
proceeding,
but
to
get
on
with
it.
and
if
the
court,
an
article
iii
court,
were
to
determine
that
there
is
no
legitimate
source-of-strength
power,
then
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
court,
in
determining
whether
the
automatic
stay
is
in
effect
or
not,
has
the
ability
to
determine
that
issue.
in
effect,
it's
really
determining
if
it
has
jurisdiction
because
under
section
1818(i),
which
is
the
preclusion
or
deferral
statute,
even
the
section
says
that
no
court
shall
take
action
by
injunction
or
otherwise
to
stay
a
notice
or
an
order
issued
under
this
section.
so
the
question
is,
is
the
order
really
issued
under
this
section.
is
there
a
statutory
power
to
enforce
the
source
of
strength.
now
on
that
issue,
we
would
submit
that
the
record
is
hopelessly
deficient
to
demonstrate
a
source-of-strength
power.
the
only
statute
that
comes
close
to
authorizing
a
review
of
financial
or
managerial
prospects
and
resources
of
the
holding
company
is
1842(c),
and
that
is
that
is
the
same
statute
that
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
first
lincolnwood.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
i'm
reluctant
to
call
it
a
leedom
kind
of...
it
is
a
leedom
type
of
analysis.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
well,
i
think
that
1818(i),
which
requires
that
you
proceed
either
in
the
district
court
on
temporary
orders
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
final
orders,
is
analogous
to
an
exhaustion
statute.
and
i
think
there
are
two
attacks
to
an
exhaustion
statute:
one,
a
constitutional
collateral
attack,
and
the
other,
the
question
of
whether
the
agency
is
proceeding
in
fulfillment
of
a
valid
statutory
purpose.
and
it
is
that
analysis
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
make
here
on
the
source
of
strength.
because
the
only
statute
that
relates
to
this
is
1842(c),
and
that
in
a
very
limited
sense
authorizes
the
board
of
governors
to
look
at
the
financial
and
managerial
prospects
at
the
time
of
acquisition
or
merger,
not
to
give
it
a
continual
let's
look
at
the
financial
resources
and
prospects
and
let's
allow
the
board
of
governors
to
make
an
unlimited
capital
assessment
of
a
holding
company's
assets
for
all
time's
sake.
that
would
be
an
extraordinary
transfer
of
the
wealth
of
the
holding
company
to
the
banks
for
the
benefit
of
the
fdic.
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
seems
to
indicate
the
power
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
governors.
nor
is
there,
we
submit,
in
any
other
legislation,
such
a
power.
indeed,
in
the
thirties,
in
the
1930's,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
eliminated
the
shareholder
assessment
capability
in
a
serious
of
four
amendments
in
1933,
i
believe
5,
and
then
later
stretching
into
the
1950's,
despite
testimony
during
those
hearings,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
that
this
was
a
valuable
tool
in
allowing
the
regulatory
authorities
to
work
with
the
stockholders
and
management
of
then-troubled
and
failing
banks.
so
that
the
congress
made
a
fundamental
policy
decision
in
the
thirties
to
eliminate
capital
assessment
abilities.
and
it
is
in
the
face
of
that
elimination
that
the
board,
nevertheless,
seeks
to
enforce
the
source-of-strength
doctrine
here,
under
the
guise
of
this
very
vague
statutory
term
of
unsafe
and
unsound,
which
we
think
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
anything.
this
relief
is
extraordinary
to
say
to
an
independent
corporation,
formed
with
its
own
shareholders
and
its
own
creditors,
you
must
transfer
all
of
your
assets
into
your
banks,
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
help
you.
you
must
denude
yourself
of
all
of
your
assets.
that
just
can't
be
the
law
without
an
express
direction
from
the
congress,
we
submit.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
the
final
would
be
subject
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
yes,
it
could
be
an
issue,
justice
white.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
the
standard
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
seem
to
me...
as
best
i
recollect
it
would
be...
whether
or
not
the
agency
action
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
that
is...
i'm
not
sure
that
necessarily
that
would
involve...
i
guess
it
would
involve
the
determination
of
whether
there
was
power.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
well,
it
would
be
a
question
of
deciding--
mr.
alan
b.
miller
--whether
the
determination
was
appropriate,
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
the
administrative
procedures
act
requires
a
finding.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
if
we're
just
referring
to
the
notice
of
charges,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we've
done
then
is
hold
hostage
the
chapter
11
that
congress
has
authorized
the
bank
holding
company
to
take
advantage
of
until
the
long
road
at
the
end
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
and
that
since
this
is
a
purely
legal
issue,
it
is
not
factual
driven
at
all,
this
could
be
considered
well
before
that
by
a
court
in
the
context--
mr.
alan
b.
miller
--that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
it's
the
determination
of
the
extent
to
which
the
administrative
proceeding
is
automatically
stayed
by
the
congressional
act
of
section
362(a).
it
is
in
that
context
that
i
make
that
suggestion,
justice.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
i
think
that's
correct.
yes,
justice.
that
is
correct.
to
the
point
on
the
merits
of
source
of
strength,
we
would
also
point
to
the
many,
indeed
i
suspect
a
dozen,
legislative
initiatives
that
have
occurred
since
1987
when
the
board
of
governors
first
announced...
announced
for
the
first
time
in
some
30
years...
what
the
source
of
strength,
at
least
in
its
view,
was
all
about.
it
first
indicated
that
the
regulation
why,
under
which
it
was
purporting
to
adopt
a
policy
statement,
had
something
to
do
with
down-streaming
of
assets
from
holding
companies
to
banks.
and
subsequent
to
that
date,
virtually
every
other
regulator
has
taken
the
position
that
this
is
either
flawed,
it
doesn't
exist,
or
it
shouldn't
exist
for
a
variety
of
policy
reasons.
accordingly,
it
is
our
belief
that
the
court
should
defer
to
the
congress
on
the
question
of
source
of
strength,
require
the
congress,
if
you
will,
if
they
determine
that
it's
appropriate
to
have
a
source
of
strength,
to
so
state.
and
as
a
consequence,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
court
below.
that
concludes
my
remarks.
and,
of
course,
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
questions
of
the
court.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
yes.
if
i
could
just
take
1
minute.
before
the
proceeding
began...
that's
not
quite
accurate.
an
involuntary
proceeding
was
filed
on
march
20...
i
think
it's
march
24
of
1989.
about
4
or
5
days
later,
20
of
the
25
banks
were
closed
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
of
the
remaining
five,
four
have
been
sold
during
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
one
remains.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
the
name
of
the
bank
is
ambank
new
braunfels,
n-e-w
b-r-a-u-n-f-e-l-s.
mr.
alan
b.
miller
i'm
not
sure
what
the
position
of
the
federal
reserve
board
is
on
whether
this
proceeding
would
be
obviated
by
a
disposition
of
that
bank.
