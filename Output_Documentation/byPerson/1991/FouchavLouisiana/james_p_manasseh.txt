mr.
james
p.
manasseh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
once
an
insanity
acquittee
has
regained
his
sanity,
may
the
government
continue
to
confine
him
in
a
mental
institution
indefinitely
solely
on
the
basis
that
he
cannot
prove
that
he
is
no
longer
a
danger
to
society?
terry
foucha
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
back
in
1984.
since
that
time
he
has
since
regained
his
sanity.
and
it
was
established
at
a
release
hearing
back
in
1988.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
answered
in
the
affirmative
that
once
an
individual
has
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
he
must,
in
order
to
gain
release,
prove
that
he
is
no
longer
a
danger
to
himself
or
to
society.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
4-3
majority
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
by
finding
that
such
a
statutory
scheme
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause
and
equal
protection
clause.
terry
foucha's
plea
was
accepted
pursuant
to
a
statute
in
louisiana
that
allowed
the
judge
to
accept
his
plea
with
the
concurrence
of
the
respondent's
office.
since
that
time,
as
i
said,
he's
regained
his
sanity.
and
that's
been
established
at
the
release
hearing
in
1988.
he
has
since
remained
in
limbo
because
the
statutory
scheme
in
louisiana
requires
that
in
order
to
gain
release
the
individual
must
prove
that
he
is
not
a
danger
to
himself
or
society.
the
problem
is
that
the
statute
makes
irrelevant
his
present
mental
condition.
it
does
not
consider
whether
he
is
mentally
healthy
or
whether
he's
not.
it
makes
that
determination
irrelevant
to
whether
he
can
regain,
whether
he
can
ever
gain
release
from
the
mental
institution.
in
jones
v.
united
states,
this
court
stated
that
the
constitution
permits
the
government
to
continue
confinement
indefinitely
of
an
insanity
acquittee
until
such
time
as
the
individual
regains
his
sanity
or
is
no
longer
a
danger
to
himself
or
to
others.
we
believe
that
once
he
regains
his
sanity,
the
indefinite
custodial
confinement
of
this
insanity
acquittee
must
cease
and
cannot
be
based
any
further
on
his
finding
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
it
did
deal
with
a
statute
that
required
both
of
those
findings.
and
that's
the
way
the
louisiana
supreme
court
differed
and
found,
as
opposed
to
our
position,
that
the
insanity
acquittee
is
entitled
to
release
once
one
of
those
two
things
is
established.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
think
that
jones
supports
our
condition
because
jones
specifically
says
that
the
constitution...
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
ignored
the
reference
to
the
constitution
in
that
particular
holding.
in
addition,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--yes.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
statute,
the
reasoning
in
jones
specifically
said...
and
i'm
not
here
to
tell
the
court
what
the
court
meant
in
jones...
but
if
the
nature
and
the
duration
of
confinement
must
be
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
initial
confinement,
and
his
initial
confinement
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
therefore,
his
confinement
must
continue
because
he
is
continuing
to
be
mentally
ill
and
dangerous,
once
he
establishes
that
he
is
no
longer
dangerous...
excuse
me.
once
he
establishes
that
he's
regained
his
sanity,
then
the
finding
of
dangerousness
that
the
louisiana
statute
allows
is
not
related
to
the
mental
illness
for
which
he
was
originally
committed
for.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
can
be
certain
circumstances,
if
a
statute
is
narrowly
tailored
and
specifically
defined
such
as
the
situation
of
a
regulatory
detention,
that
the
state
could
have
interests
that
outweigh
the
individual's
liberty
interest.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
do
i
concede
that
it
is
valid?
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
i
do
not
necessarily
concede
that
it
is
valid.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ruled
on
that
issue
as
of
this
time.
but
the
washington
statute
is
different
than
louisiana's,
your
honor.
the
washington
statute
deals
with
whether
the
individual
is
fit
to
be
released.
it
doesn't
deal
with
just
a
dangerousness
test
as
the
louisiana
supreme
court
indicated
in
their
opinion.
it
dealt
with
whether
the
individual
could
show
that
he
was
fit
for
release.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
we
may
not
be.
in
that
situation
the
government's
interest
with
a
narrowly
tailored,
specifically
defined
statutory
scheme
might...
in
those
circumstances,
the
government's
interest
in
societal
protection
might
outweigh
the
individual's
liberty
interest.
but
the
statute
we
have
here
requires
an
indefinite
confinement,
perhaps
a
lifetime
confinement,
for
all
insanity
acquittees,
no
matter
what
their
charge.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
believe
that
what
would
happen
would
be
the
matter
would
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
make
a
specific
finding...
factual
finding
whether
he
is
in
fact
not
mentally
ill
or
not.
the
testimony
at
the
release
hearing,
by
the
state's
own
witness,
indicated
that
he
was
no
longer
mentally
ill.
the
trial
judge,
though,
did
not
specifically
state
on
the
record
that
he
found
that
he
was
no
longer
mentally
ill.
but
that
evidence
was
uncontroverted
in
the
record.
but
that
would
be
a
factual
determination
for
the
trial
court
to
make.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
that
would
underlie
the
argument
under
one
phase
of
a
substantive
due
process
argument
that
once
an
individual
has
proven
himself
to
no
longer
be
mentally
ill,
he
could
no
longer
be
indefinitely
confined
in
a
mental
institution.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
just
as
i
said,
the
government
may
be
able
to
fashion
a
statutory
scheme
similar
to
a
salerno
situation
that
in
those
circumstances
the
government
interest
would
outweigh
the
individual's
liberty
interest.
i'm
not
here
to
give
the
louisiana
legislature
any--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
respectfully,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
what
i'm
saying.
the
dangerousness
that
louisiana
commits
an
individual
who
has
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
because
he's
insane
and
that
finding,
as
jones
points
out,
is
sufficient
to
establish
continuing
mental
illness
and
his
dangerousness.
but
once
his
mental
illness
is
cleared
up,
then
the
dangerousness
should
not
be
just
a
uniform,
any
sort
of
dangerousness.
it
should
be
some
sort
of
a
dangerousness
related
to
his
mental
illness.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
at
that
point
i
would
suggest
that
an
addington-type
hearing
should
be
called
for
in
order
for
the
government
to
make
some
sort
of
a
showing
that
he
is,
in
fact,
dangerous,
that
it's
not
related
necessarily
to
the
mental
illness
to
justify
his
continued
confinement.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
as
i
pointed
out
before,
your
honor,
there
was
not
a
jury
in
this
situation.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
the
trial,
the
trial
judge...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
they
have.
and
he's
been
committed.
and
he's
been
indefinitely
held
in
the
mental
institution.
but
now,
once
he's
regained
his
sanity,
his
mental...
his
dangerousness
is
not
related
to
the
mental
illness
which
he
had.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
at
that
point,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
government
could
not
make
that
sort
of
a
showing,
but
it
seems
as
though
that
procedural
due
process
would
require
that
the
government
make
that
showing
pursuant
to
addington
because
the
burden
of
the
individual
trying
to
prove
nondangerousness
is
a
untenable
type
of
burden
to
maintain.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
he
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
theoretically,
that's
what
that
means.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
judgment
on
page,
i
believe,
it's
5
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
judgment
indicates
that
the
court
accepted
a
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
judgment.
so
it
is
unclear
from
looking
at
that
judgment
and
looking
at
the
record
whether
the
trial
court
actually
made
a
factual
determination
that
he
was
in
fact
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense
at
that
time.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
why
the
case
was
accepted.
my
point
is
is
that
it's...
you're
unable
to
make
the
determination
by
looking
at
the
record
whether
the
individual
actually
committed
a
criminal
offense
to
begin
with.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
they
made
the
assumption
that
the
theoretical
basis
of
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
plea
is
guilty,
but
insane.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
well,
for
one
thing,
your
honor,
the
detention
in
this
case
is
indefinite.
it
can
be
a
lifetime
confinement.
in
salerno
it
was
for
a
very
limited
duration
based
upon
the
speedy
trial
act.
secondly,
your
honor,
the
salerno
act
targeted
only
the
most
dangerous
of
criminals.
this
act
allows
for
any
insanity
acquittee,
no
matter
what
sort
of
offense
that
he
committed,
whether
it's
a
dwi,
a
minor
misdemeanor
theft,
or
whether
it's
a
first-degree
murder
situation,
any
insanity
acquittee
is
refused
to
be
released
unless
he
can
prove
himself
not
to
be
a
danger.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
they
do
to
some
extent,
your
honor.
i
don't
necessarily
know
if
they
amount
to
the
same
thing.
under
louisiana
civil
statutes,
an
individual
can
only
be
continued
to
be
confined
if
he
is
dangerous
as
a
result
of
his
mental
illness.
we
would
suggest
that
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
to
have
a
dual
finding
in
a
civil
commitment
statute,
but
only
to
require
and
allow
the
government
to
confine
an
individual
criminally
if
he
fails
to
prove
himself
nondangerous,
even
after
he's
shown
to
be
not
mentally
ill.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
at
that
point,
again,
i
would
say
that
i
believe
that
the
government
may,
under
certain
circumstances--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--i
would
have
to
look
more
deeply
into
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
i
don't
necessarily
know
that
that
would...
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
pursuant
to
salerno.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
don't
necessarily
know
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
of
course
there's
a
distinction
when
the
government
has
shown
that
the
individual
has
at
one
time
committed
a
criminal
act.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
don't
know
necessarily
that
it's
more
reliable.
once
his
mental
illness
has
subsided--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--your
honor,
because
once
the
criminal
act
had
occurred
the
individual
is
not
necessarily
in
a
position
to
prove
that
he
cannot
at
some
point
not
present
a
danger.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
i
believe
in
the
situation
where
the
act
has
already
occurred
the
government
can
make
a
limited,
carefully
drawn,
regulatory
detention.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
yes.
it's
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
has
already
shown
that
in
certain
circumstances
while
he
is
mentally
ill
he
may
in
fact
be
a
danger.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
again,
the
reason
being
is
because
the
fact
that
the
individual
had
suffered
from
a
mental
illness
and
was
dangerous
at
one
time
may
support
that
sort
of
a
finding.
the
louisiana
district
attorney's
office
out
of
orleans
parish
suggests
that
the
government's
interest
in
societal
protection
is
legitimate
and
a
compelling
interest.
this
court
has
stated
that
just
because
the
invocation
of
a
legitimate
purpose
is
made
by
the
government,
that
it
cannot
support
all
such
restraints.
the
court
looks
at
whether
the
restriction
is
excessive
in
relationship
to
the
government
interest.
this
particular
restraint,
the
indefinite
custodial
confinement
in
a
mental
institution
of
someone
who's
been
found
to
no
longer
be
mentally
ill
certainly
must
fall
within
the
grounds
of
excessiveness.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
there's
a
hearing
and
he's
entitled
to
a
litany
of
different
hearings.
the
problem
is
is
that
when
the
burden
is
on
the
individual
to
prove
nondangerousness,
he
can
have
a
hearing
every
day,
every
other
day,
and
it
is
not
going
to
make
that
burden
any
more
reasonable
for
the
individual
to
meet.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
but,
your
honor--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--your
honor,
when
the
individual
has
already
committed
an
act
and
the
judge
can
rely
upon
the
testimony
of
a
doctor
who
has
seen
him
for
just
a
short
period
of
time
to
testify
that
he
refuses
to
certify
that
the
individual
is
not
a
danger,
this
doctor
will
never
certify
that
he's
not
a
danger.
if
this
court
does
not
reverse
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
terry
foucha
will,
in
all
likelihood,
remain
at
that
mental
institution
for
the
rest
of
his
life
because
dr.
ritter
is
never
going
to
certify,
and
no
doctor
will
ever
certify,
that
anyone
will
not
be
a
danger.
and
dr.
ritter--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--i'm
not
saying
that
that's
irrelevant,
your
honor.
but
i
am
saying
that
there
was
no
specific...
the
facts
given
by
dr.
ritter
about
the
fact
that
he
jabbed...
somebody
was
jabbed
with
a
pen
doesn't
indicate
whether
terry
foucha
jabbed
the
person
with
the
pen
or
whether
he
was
provoked
or
what
the
circumstance
was.
he
is
a
sane
person
in
a
mental
institution
with
lots
of
insane
people.
there
are
going
to
be
incidents
at
the
mental
institution
regarding
different
problems.
the
doctor
indicates
that
he's
paranoid
and
he's
not
the...
he's
not
the
nicest...
he's
had
some
problems
with
management.
i
would
suggest
that
anyone
who
was
confined
in
a
mental
institution
who
knows
that
he
is
not
insane
and
has
had
six
specific
doctors
tell
him
that
he's
not
insane,
a
little
paranoia
is
probably
justified
in
that
circumstance.
one
of
the
problems
that
i
think
procedurally
the
case
has
is
this
unbridled
discretion
that
the
trial
judge
is
given
to
disregard
the
recommendation
of
the
superintendent,
the
recommendation
of
the
review
panel
who
recommended
specifically
at
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix
that
he
could
be
released,
he
is
no
longer
insane,
and
that
he
could
be
released
without
danger
to
himself
or
to
others.
the
doctor,
dr.
ritter,
comes
in
and
testifies,
well,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
feel
comfortable
in
certifying
that
he
wouldn't
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
to
others.
the
judge
basically
is
given
unbridled
discretion
because
the
statute
does
not
give
specific
considerations
for
him
to
consider,
such
as
the
statute
did
in
salerno.
and,
again,
and
this
point
is
very
important,
the
government
may
be
able
to
come
in
and
make
a
carefully
limited
and
narrowly
drawn
statutory
requirement
that
allows
for
the
indefinite
confinement
of
an
insanity
acquittee
even
if
he's
regained
his
sanity.
but
this
type
of
indefinite
confinement
based
upon
his
failure
to
be
able
to
prove
nondangerousness
is...
is
clearly
the
most
excessive
type
of
restraint
that
louisiana
can
fashion.
it
is
in
no
way
related
or
closely
akin
to
the
type
of
restriction
in
salerno.
salerno
was
specific,
that
it
was
a
narrow
set
of
factual
circumstances
that
led
to
that
opinion.
it
was
a
brief
period
of
time,
of
detention.
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proving
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
there
were
no
circumstances
under
which
the
individual
could
be
released
without
endangering
society.
the
statute
specifically
specified
the
most
dangerous
types
of
criminals,
major
drug
offenders,
murderers,
and
those
types
of
individuals.
in
addition,
the
court,
the
legislature
laid
out
specific
factors
that
the
government
was
to
consider
and
the
judge
was
to
consider
in
making
the
determination
whether
a
limited
duration
regulatory
confinement
could
be
instituted
in
that
situation.
louisiana's
statute
isn't
close.
it
has
a
possible
lifetime
confinement
in
a
mental
institution
by
an
insanity
acquittee.
it
involves
all
insanity
acquittees
with
no
relation
to
the...
to
the
facts.
it
gives
the
court
no
factors
to
consider
in
making
its
decision.
and
there's
no
showing
necessary
by
the
government
to
prove
the
different
circumstances
for
his
release.
your
honor,
the
government
wants
this
court
to
look
at
these
statutes
and
to
apply
these
factors
in
a
very
mechanicalistic
fashion,
the
regulatory
detention
circumstances,
very
mechanicalistically.
i
would
suggest
that
those
sort
of
mechanical
applications
cannot
be
applied
in
this
sort
of
situation
where
an
individual
is
looking
at...
his
liberty
interests
are
involved.
as
far
as
the
equal
protection
argument
goes,
this
court
stated
that
in
baxstrom
that
the
fact
that
a
person
has
suffered
and
been
convicted
and
was
sentenced
to
a
specific
sentence,
that
that
was
not,
that
was
insufficient
to
justify
giving
him
less
protection
than
those
given
to
individuals
who
are
civilly
committed.
i
would
certainly
suggest
that
an
individual
who's
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
should
also
not
be
given
less
procedural
and
substantive
protections
as
those
afforded
to
other
civil
committees
in
louisiana.
even
convicted
felons
are
not
put
in
the
position
that
insanity
acquittees
are
put
in
in
louisiana.
a
convicted
felon,
when
his
term
of
sentence
is
up,
he
is
entitled
to
release
and
it
has
nothing--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--even
though
he
may
be
dangerous,
your
honor,
he
is
entitled
to
release
once
his
sentence
is
up.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
there
certainly
are,
your
honor.
but
the
dangerousness
of
my
client
is
not...
for
which
he
was
originally
sentenced
for
was
because
he
was
dangerous
in
relationship
because
he
was
mentally
ill.
once
his
mental
illness
has
been
cured,
then
the
dangerousness
that's
related
to
the
mental
illness
is
irrelevant
to
the
fact
of
whether
they're
going
to
try
to
confine
him
at
this
particular
point.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
nature...
because
the
nature
and
duration
is,
of
confinement,
is
related
to
the
reason
that
he
has
committed,
that
his
dangerousness
was
related
to
his
mental
illness.
and
that
was
the
reason
that
an
insanity
acquittee...
an
insanity
acquittal--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--it
means
that
you
did
not
understand
right
from
wrong,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
it
doesn't
go
to
his
motivation
is
because
a
person
who
is
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
has
no
criminal
intent
to
commit
a
crime,
just
as
an
individual
who
maybe
makes
a
mistake
and
commits
a
criminal
act
or
who
doesn't
act
in
self-defense--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--your
honor,
in
louisiana
it
means
that
they
didn't
understand
right
from
wrong.
and
if
they
didn't
understand
right
from
wrong--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
is
someone
doesn't
understand
what's
right
from
wrong,
then
they
couldn't
have
criminal
intent
to
commit
a
criminal
act.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
i
will
respectfully
note
the
court's
opinion.
your
honors,
there
is
something
that
is
holy
and
just
about
a
situation
in
which
the
government
can
tell
a
young
man
that
he's
not
guilty
because
he
was
sick,
because
he
was
ill,
and
then
refuse
to
release
him
from
a
mental
institution--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--yes,
sir,
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
i
believe
that
the
government
could.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
if
he
had
chosen
to
take
it
at
that
particular
point,
he
would.
but
this
situation,
he's
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
he
should
be
released
once
he
establishes
that
his
insanity
is
no
longer
relevant.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
thank
you,
your
honor.
terry
foucha
is
being
harmed
because
he
had
a
good
attorney
to
begin
with
that
showed
that
he
was...
that
proved
himself
to
be
insane
at
the
time
of
the
incident,
and
he
is
being
harmed
now
because
he
had
a
bad
attorney
that
was
unable
to
prove
that
he
was
not
a
danger.
he
would
have
been
better
off
to
have
the
bad
attorney
to
begin
with,
be
found
guilty,
been
sentenced
to
a
short
period
of
time--
mr.
james
p.
manasseh
--your
honor,
it
was
a
first
offense.
he
was
17
years
old.
in
all
likelihood,
he
would
have
been
sentenced
to
a
short
amount
of
time.
once
his
time
was
up,
he'd
have
been
released
without
having
to
try
to
prove
nondangerousness.
there
is
no
way
for
him
to
prove
a
negative
proposition,
that
he
would
not
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
community.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse.
