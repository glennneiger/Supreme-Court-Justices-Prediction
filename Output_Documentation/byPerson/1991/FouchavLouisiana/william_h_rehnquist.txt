chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
no.
90-5844,
terry
foucha
v.
louisiana.
mr.
manasseh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
jones,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
statute,
was
it
not,
that
required
both
of
those
findings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
jones
supports
your
position
or
is
simply
neutral?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
jones,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
statute
that
required
both
of
those.
and
it
said
that
statute
is
constitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
i
would
think,
the
statute
which
required
less
from
the
state
than
the
jones
statute
is
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
can't
the
government
base
it
on
his
conviction,
but
for
insanity,
of
aggravated
burglary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understand
the
louisiana
procedure
is
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
which
means
that
the
jury
found
he
did
commit
the
aggravated
burglary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
judge,
the
judge
found
he
committed--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
can't
they
use
that
as
a
basis
for
finding
him
dangerous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
have
to
be?
why
can't
louisiana
simply
say
this
man
committed
an
aggravated
burglary
and
we're
going
to
confine
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
did
once
sustain
that
burden
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
that
mean
that
he
was
found
to
have
committed
the
crime,
but
was
not
culpable
by
reason
of
insanity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
is
this
case
simply
a
sport?
i
mean,
a
peculiar
fact
situation?
i
thought
we
took
the
case
to
decide
whether
someone
who
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
could
be
confined
after
they
were
no
longer
ill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
assumption
did
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
go
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
i
think
we
would
probably
go
on
that
same
assumption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
he
was
dangerous
because
of
his
mental
illness.
why
do
you
deduce
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
necessarily
follow,
though?
i
mean,
an
insanity
acquittal,
what,
in
louisiana
means
that
you
weren't
able
to
appreciate
the
consequences
of
your
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
does
that
necessarily
explain
why
the
defendant
did,
committed
this
particular
crime?
that
doesn't
go
to
his
motivation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
is
that
louisiana
law
or
is
that
your
speculation
about
what
it
might
mean?
because
it
certainly
isn't
accepted
everywhere
that
someone
who
is
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
lacks
the
intent.
i
think
in
many
states
that
is
regarded,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
is
an
affirmative
defense...
that
the
state
can
make
out
all
the
other
elements
including
intent,
and
you
can
still
say
you
have
an
affirmative
defense,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
so
in
many
states
it
does
not
negate
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
non
sequitur
to
say
that
they
didn't
understand
right
from
wrong,
therefore,
they
didn't
have
the
necessary
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
state
of
louisiana
in
its
aggravated
burglary
statute
requires
that
the
state
show
that
a
person
entered
a
dwelling
in
the
nighttime
with
the
intent
to
enter
in
order
to
commit
a
felony,
it
seems
to
me
the
state
could
prove
every
one
of
those
elements,
and
including
the
intent,
the
intent
to
enter
the
dwelling
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony.
and
you...
the
fact
that
a
person
didn't
know
right
from
wrong
would
be,
would
go
to
insanity.
it
wouldn't
go
to
the
lack
of
intent
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
manasseh.
ms.
moran,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
moran.
mr.
manasseh,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manasseh.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-5844,
foucha
against
louisiana
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
