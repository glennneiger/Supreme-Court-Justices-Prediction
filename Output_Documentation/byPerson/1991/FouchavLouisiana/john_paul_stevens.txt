justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
is
it
not
fair
to
infer
that
the
reason
he
did
it
was
that
he
was
mentally
unbalanced
at
the
time
of
the
act?
and
that
is
why
the
finding
of
not
guilty
was
returned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
an
inexact
science,
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
as
long
as
one
is
unclear,
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
person
is
dangerous
or
not,
which
is
probably
true
of
most
individuals,
then
the
individual
cannot
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
beyond...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he's
not
dangerous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
uncertain...
in
all
uncertain
cases,
the
person
must
remain
incarcerated
forever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
psychiatrists
are
all
uncertain,
because
of
his
past
history,
and
are
unwilling
to
say,
i
certify
this
man
is
no
longer
dangerous,
then
he
loses,
doesn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but,
what
is
there
in
judicial
history
that
determines
dangerousness
from
some
source
other
than
prior
criminal
acts
on
the
one
hand
or
mental
disease
on
the
other?
what
is
this
other
category
of
dangerousness
that's
unrelated
to
mental
illness
and
unrelated
to
wrongdoing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then...
but
you
say...
then
would
you
not
win
on
the
ground
that
he
is
still
mentally
ill?
are
there
personality
disorders
that
are
unrelated
to
mental
illness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he
could...
if
you
think
he's
got
a
personality
disorder
unrelated
to
mental
illness,
but
nevertheless
makes
him
dangerous,
could
you
commit
him
if
he
had...
never
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
say
you
just
find
a
man
out
in
the
street
who
meets
the
very
characteristics
that
you
assigned
to
this
man.
could
he
be
put
away
for
preventive
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
you
had
a
man
on
the
street
who
did
the
same
act
that
this
man
did,
served
5
years
in
the
penitentiary,
which
would
be
the
maximum
sentence
for
it,
and
then
you
say,
we
think
he's
still
dangerous,
and
we
can
prove
he
has
the
kind
of
difficulty
that
you
described
as
to
him.
could
you
put
him
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
poses
precisely
the
same
threat
to
society.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
the
same
history,
and
the
same
kind
of
mental
problem...
mental...
what
do
you
call
it...
personality
disorder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
how
do
you
differentiate
my
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
man
who
admittedly
committed
the
crime
on
the
one
hand
and
was
sentenced
for
the
maximum
term,
yet
when
he
gets
out,
the
warden
thinks
he's
still
dangerous
and
he
could
perhaps
prove
he's...
he
may
do
it
again,
and
the
man
before
us
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
louisiana
law
could
allow
it,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
supposing
he
did
all
that,
and
the
judge
said,
well,
yes,
but
i'm
still
not
sure.
after
all,
you
had
a
fight
with
another
inmate
9
years
ago,
and
i'm
not
sure.
you
haven't
carried
your
burden.
i
mean,
there's
always
some
risk,
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
these
are
people
who
have
had
some
problems
in
society.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
in
doubt,
confine
them.
that's
the
rule.
that's
exactly
the
rule,
because
the
burden
is
on
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
in
doubt,
he
stays
there
forever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
not...
as
long
as
there's
doubt,
as
long
as
there's
doubt,
he
stays
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
rule,
by
the
way,
with
your
civil
committees?
if
someone
is
committed
civilly,
does
that
person
have
to
prove
both
the
lack
of
dangerousness
and
recovery
from
the
mental
illness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
very
expensive,
ms.
moran.
why
doesn't
the
state
just
take
him
out
of
the
mental
institution,
since
he
no
longer
has
the
mental
illness?
i
mean,
they're
spending
a
lot
of
money
for
doctors
and
everything.
they
could
just
put
him
in
a
regular
jail,
once
he's
recovered
his
sanity.
just
put
him
in
a
regular
jail
until
somebody
says
he's
no
longer
dangerous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent
says
it
would
have
30
years.
