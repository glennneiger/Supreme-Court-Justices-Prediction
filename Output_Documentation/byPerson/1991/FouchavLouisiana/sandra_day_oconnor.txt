justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
manasseh,
what
about
a
statute
like
in
the
state
of
washington
that,
for
someone
who
is
acquitted
in
a
criminal
case
as
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
is
then
committed
to
a
mental
institution
for
a
specific
term
of
years
that
might,
for
example,
be
related
to
some
equivalent
penalty
for
the
offense.
do
you
think
that
under
circumstances
such
as
in
this
case
that
such
as
individual
likewise
would
have
to
be
released?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
a
statutory
scheme
such
as
washington
state's
is
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
put
it
this
way.
suppose
louisiana
were
to
put
a
cap
on
the
period
of
time
in
which
someone
could
be
held
and
put
a
limitation
on
it.
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
manasseh,
in
what
way
are
the
conditions
of
confinement
in
a
mental
institution
more
restrictive
or
oppressive
than
the
kind
of
confinement
this
court
upheld
in
salerno,
pretrial
detention?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
your
equal
protection
claim
add
anything
to
the
due
process
claim?
do
they
really
merge
and
amount
to
the
same
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
state
could
make
it
more
difficult
to
plead
and
establish
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
as
an
alternative?
