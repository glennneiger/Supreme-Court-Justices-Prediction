justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
where
the
statute
provided
for
a
limit,
say,
of
2
years
on
any
confinement
which
could
be
maintained
after
the
mental
illness
has
disappeared
and
if
the
government
had
the
burden,
say,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
prove
continued
dangerousness
after
that
point,
would
you
find
a
constitutional
infirmity
in
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
the
circumstances
i
just
gave
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
that
is
the
case
would
you
also
agree...
let's
assume
that
the
dangerousness
here
relates
to
dangerousness
in
terms
of
likely
physical
violence
rather
than,
say,
dangerousness
in
some
belated
sense
of
just
committing
further
crimes
like
check-writing,
say,
real
dangerousness
to
the
health
or
safety
of
other
human
beings.
by
the
same
principle
that
you,
i
think,
have
just
conceded,
could
the
government
not
confine
individuals
for
periods
of
2
years
without
there
being
any
preceding
criminal
charge
and
without
there
ever
being
any
finding
of
insanity?
could
the
government,
in
other
words,
simply
say
we're
going
to
round
up
dangerous
individuals
and
if
we
can
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
are
dangerous,
we
will
confine
them
for
2
years
subject
to
a
renewable
commitment
with
the
burden
being
on
us?
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
case
that
i
gave
you
in
which
the
insanity
had
been
cured
and
the
government
could
keep
the
person
in
for
2
more
years
subject
to
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
that
distinction
because
the
proof
of
dangerousness
is
more
reliable?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
my...
in
the
example
that
i'm
giving,
in
each
instance
the
mental
illness
is
cured
or
disappeared.
a
period
of
2
years
go
by.
the
government
has
a
burden
at
that
point
either
to
release
the
person
or
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
person
remains
dangerous.
and
i
thought
your
answer
was
that
if
that
situation
arose
following
a
not
guilty
by
insanity
plea,
it
could
be
constitutional
for
the
government
to
keep
the
person
in
for
another
2
years,
to
renew
the
commitment.
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
preceding
ngi
or
a
preceding
offense
giving
rise
to
that,
that
the
government
could
not
do
that
constitutionally.
and
i
want
to
know
why
you
can
do
it
in
the
one
instance
and
not
in
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
that's
the
conclusion
that
you
come
to,
but
why
do
you
come
to
it?
is
it
because
the
fact
of
the
preceding
criminal
offense
lends
a
greater
weight
to
the
soundness
of
the
finding
of
dangerousness
which
it
subsequently
makes?
or
is
there
some
other
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
on
my
hypothesis,
he's
not
mentally
ill
anymore.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
was
clear
but
then
i
began
to
wonder,
louisiana
does
require
proof
not
only
of
insanity,
but
of
dangerousness
as
a
separate
element
prior
to
the
original
commitment.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
except
that
you...
would
you
concede
that
at
some
point
the
probative
value
of
the
initial
act
or
the
probative
value
of
the
insanity
finding,
as
itself,
some
index
of
future
dangerousness,
weakens.
over
time,
it
tends
to
prove
a
lower
and
lower
and
lower
likelihood
of
future
dangerousness,
standing
all
by
itself.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
he
wants
to
get
out,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
prove
that
he
is
no
longer
dangerous,
right?
