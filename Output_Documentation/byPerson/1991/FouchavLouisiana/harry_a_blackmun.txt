counsel,
if
you
prevail
here
what
happens?
is
he
released?
or
is
there
another
what
you
call
contradictory
hearing?
justice

even
though
he
may
be
dangerous?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
a
lot
of
dangerous
people
out
there,
aren't
there?
justice
harry

how
do
you
really
prove
dangerousness?
future

justice

well,
not
very
long
ago,
the
american
medical
association
issued
a
paper
saying
that
the
prognosis
of
future
dangerousness
is
wrong
more
times
than
it
is
correct.
does
that
bother
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
has
been
cited
in
an
opinion
in
this
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
think
it
is
true
that
medical
opinion
often
says
that
a
murderer,
incarcerated,
will
never
commit
another
crime.
some.
therefore,
i
say,
i
think
your
estimates
of
future
dangerousness
are
always
on
very
dangerous
ground.

blackmun
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
sounds
very
much
like
jackson
against
indiana
in
406
u.s.,
and
i
think
your
answer
was
not
in
line
with
that
holding.
you
do
not
cite
jackson
against
indiana,
and
your
opponents
do.
