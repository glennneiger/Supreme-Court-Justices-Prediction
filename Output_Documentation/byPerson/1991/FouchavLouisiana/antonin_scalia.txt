did
the
government
have
to
tell
him
that?
could
the
state
simply
disallow
the
defense
of
insanity
if
it
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
could
the
state
impose
a
sentence
for
life
for
aggravated
burglary
if
it
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
can't
the
state
say,
look,
we
don't
have
to
give
you
this
insanity
defense,
but
here's
the
deal.
if
you
choose
to
use
it,
you
simply,
you
simply
don't
get
out
of
prison
until
we're
sure
you're
no
longer
a
danger
to
society.
they
are
not
conditioning
any
constitutional
right
upon
this.
you
just
told
me
he
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
plead
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
so
the
state
says,
this
is
the
deal.
if
you
choose
to
take
it,
you
go
in
and
you
have
to
stay
there
until
you're
no
longer
a
danger.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
that
this
defendant
is
dangerous,
though.
that's
the
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
just
don't
have
a
psychiatrist
who's
willing
to
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
he's
not
dangerous.
i
mean,
the
burden...
isn't
that
a
significant
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
confused.
you
told
justice
stevens
that
dangerousness
is
not
a
medical
concept.
and
yet
the
trial
judge,
i
think
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
trial
court's
opinion,
found
dangerousness
based
on
the
doctor's
refusal
to
certify.
that
seems
to
me
quite
inconsistent.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
moran,
you're
saying
that
the
state
can
keep
this
individual
in
the
mental
institution
indefinitely,
even
though
he
no
longer
has
a
mental
illness.
right?
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
based
on
dangerousness.
could
it,
at
the
outset,
commit
somebody
to
mental
institution
for
having
committed
a
crime,
even
though
he
is
not
mentally
ill?
i
mean,
there
are
some
states
that
do
that.
it's...
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
not
generally
considered
it's
a
good
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
you
don't
think
this
fellow
should
go
to...
you
don't
think
this
fellow
should
be
in
prison.
you
think
he
should
be
in
a
mental
institution,
even
though
he
is
not
mentally
ill
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
he's
dangerous.
so
why
don't
we
just
put
him
there
in
the
first
place?
say,
you
know,
you
committed
a
burglary,
you're
as
sane
as
i
am,
but
we
are
going
to
put
you
in
a
mental
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying,
but
could
you
change
it?
i'm
going
to
change
the
law,
we're
going
to
put
you
in
a
mental
institution
instead,
the
way
they
used
to
do
in
russia.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
there
might...
do
you
think
there
might
be
something
unconstitutional
about
committing
someone
to
a
mental
institution
for
committing
a
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he
was
found
guilty--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
insane,
he's
found
guilty
and
the
law
says,
you
go
to
a
mental
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
constitutional,
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
okay
to
keep
him
there,
once
you
have
him
in
the
mental
institution,
even
though
he's
become
sane?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
pose
any
constitutional
problems?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
feel
any
better
about
the
one
than
i
do
about
the
other,
i
must
say.
but
even
if
it
puts
him
in
a
different
class,
because
there
is
a
higher
degree
of
soundness
to
the
dangerousness
prediction
as
a
result
of
having
committed
an
act
which
would
be
a
crime
but
for
the
insanity
and
having
been
found
insane?
is
that
how
you
distinguish
between
the
two
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
lot
cheaper.
you
are
not
treating
as
mental
illness
anymore.
why
put
him
in
an
insane
asylum?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he
has.
i'm
talking
about
this
defendant
here.
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
have
to
keep
him
in
an
insane
asylum?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
moran,
suppose
this...
suppose
this
defendant
has
committed
a
crime.
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
give
him
an
indeterminate
sentence,
not
20
years,
not
30
years,
not
life,
but
just,
we're
going
to
put
you
in
prison
until
we
determine
that
you
are
no
longer
dangerous.
do
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
okay
with
respect
to
this
person
who
hasn't
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
as
you
say,
to
keep
this
person
put
away
on
the...
on
the
same
kind
of
an
indeterminate,
indefinite
basis.
we're
going
to
keep
you
there
until
we
decide
that
you
are
no
longer
dangerous.
it's
okay
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
and
the
other
person
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
a
permissible
way,
is
what
i'm
asking.
if
i
put
it
to
you
straightforward
in
the
criminal
context,
it
seems
to
you
outrageous
that
society
should
say
somebody...
to
somebody,
we're
going
to
keep
you
locked
up
until
we
decide
that
you
are
no
longer
dangerous,
without
a
determinate
sentence
or
not.
why
does
it
seem
okay
to
do
it
to
this
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
insanity
is
out
of
the
question.
we're...
he's...
i
thought
it's
agreed
by
everyone
that
the
man
no
longer
has
a
mental
problem.
that's
out
of
the
question.
so
he's
just
like
the
criminal
that
i
talked
about
who's
given
a
sentence
for...
stay
in
jail
until
we
decide
you're
no
longer
dangerous.
i
don't
think
we'd
allow
that,
do
you?
