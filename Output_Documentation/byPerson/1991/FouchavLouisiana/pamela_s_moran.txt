ms.
pamela
s.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
has
a
legitimate
and
compelling
interest
in
conferring
in
an
insanity
acquittee
who
continues
to
present
a
danger
to
society,
even
though
that
acquittee
may
have
regained
his
sanity.
the
question
that
we
have
before
us,
i
think,
is
preventative
detention.
we
know
that
preventative
detention
is
allowed
in
cases
such
as
shaw
v.
martin,
which
this
court
determined
that
juveniles
can
be
detained,
postarrest,
pretrial.
also
the
case
of
u.s.
v.
salerno,
where
you
have
a
postarrest
detention
situation
where
a
dangerous
defendant
may
be
detained
simply
based
on
his
dangerousness.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
well,
i--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--i
beg
to
differ
with
you
on
this
point,
justice
scalia.
based
on
the
hearing,
lunacy
hearing,
that
was
conducted
on
november
of
1988,
certain
facts
came
out
which
indicated
that
mr.
foucha
remained
a
danger.
at
one
point,
the
three...
three-doctor
review
panel
at
the
feliciana
forensic
facility
recommended
that
he
be
released.
since
that
report
came
out,
subsequent
to
that
report,
mr.
foucha
was
detained
in
the
maximum
security
section
of
the
hospital.
that's
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
18.
joint
appendix,
page
15,
dr.
ritter
indicated
that
he
got
into
a
lot
of
difficulties.
he
had
trouble
with
feliciana.
he
had
altercations
with
other
patients,
and
it
appears
that
he
stabbed
a
prison
guard
with
an
ink
pen.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
it's
inexact.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
it's
an
inexact
science,
just
as
psychiatry
is
inexact.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
not
in
terms
of
this
petitioner,
mr.
foucha.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
it
does
not...
it
does
not
bother
me
because
i
still
feel
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
overwhelming
interest
in
protecting
the
community
from
individuals
such
as
mr.
foucha
who
remain
dangerous.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
well,
some
people...
people
may
hold
that
view,
but
i
feel
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
other
cases
as
well,
it
must
be
looked
at
on
a
case-by-case
basis
based
on
what
the
individual
has
done.
the
first
dangerous
act
the
petitioner
did
was
to
take
a.357
magnum
and
burglarize
a
home,
an
inhabited
dwelling.
also,
criminal
discharge
of
a
firearm.
that
act
in
itself
indicates
a
dangerous
individual.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
well,
then,
again,
you
come
back
to
the
inexact
science
of
psychiatry.
at
the
outset--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--well,
he
can't--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
i
think
that
mr.
foucha
and
other
insanity
acquittees
are
able
to
carry
that
burden
of
proving
that
they
are
no
longer
dangerous.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
because,
you
see,
dangerousness
is
not
a
medical
determination.
it's
a
judicial
determination.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
well,
not
necessarily
unrelated
to
wrongdoing,
but
in
mr.
foucha's
case,
he
was
diagnosed
as
having
an
antisocial
personality
disorder,
which
dr.
ritter
indicated
cannot
be
cured.
and
he
does
not
classify
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--this
appears
to
be
the
case,
from
what
i
can
ascertain
from
dr.
ritter's
testimony.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
not...
not
civilly.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
because
the
man
on
the
street
has
not
done
a
dangerous
act.
the
whole
thing
that
started
the
ball
rolling
was
the
act
that
mr.
foucha--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
because--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--because
he
has
served
his
5
years
in
the
penitentiary,
and
under--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--well--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
happy
to
see
this
person
get
out,
and
that
may
possibly
be
why
louisiana
has
some
of
the
longest
prison
sentences
in
the
country.
[laughter]
but
we
are
trying
to
protect
our
citizens.
we
know
that
we
have
people
that
go--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--and
are
dangerous.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
louisiana
law
does
not
allow
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
louisiana
law
does
not--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no.
no,
sir.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
i
think
that
dangerousness
is
a
medical
concept,
but
it
is
still
a
judicial
determination.
the
judge
can
look
at
what
the
doctors
say.
in
this
particular
instance,
judge
wimberly
was
able
to
look
at
the
report
of
the
doctors
at
feliciana.
he
was
able
to
listen
to
the
testimony
of
dr.
ritter.
but
he,
as
the
judge,
with
experience
that,
in
sitting
on
the
bench,
if
these
people
come
through
on
a
regular
basis,
has
to
look
at
all
the
facts,
weigh
the
facts,
and
then
make
a
determination.
that
is
the
way
to
set
up
under
louisiana
law.
if
it
were
not
that
way,
if
the
legislature
had
wanted,
they
could
have
just
allowed
the
doctors
at
feliciana
to
allow
the
release.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
the
results
that
you
have
here
in
the
instance
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
close.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
based
on
dangerousness.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
that...
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
the
person
who
commits
a
crime
and
is
not
mentally
ill
should
go
to
prison.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
i--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
if
you
are
sane,
and
you
commit
a
burglary,
then
you
go
to
prison,
because
you...
you...
because--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
because
mental
institutions
are
not
prisons.
they
have...
they
serve
a
different
purpose.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
the
idea
is
to
rehabilitate
the
individual--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--not
if
he
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
and
he's--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--yes,
that's--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
because
the
state
has
no--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
putting--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--such
an
individual
in
a
mental
institution.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
they--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--no,
based...
it
does
not,
based
on
the
initial
process
by
which
this
individual
came
to
be
in
that
mental
hospital,
based
upon
that
insanity
plea.
and
if
his
adjudication
has
been
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
it
puts
him
in
a
different
class.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
yes,
i
think
there's
a
stronger
basis
at
the
outset
for
committing
the
man
to
the
mental
institution.
and
i
feel
also
very
strongly
that
the
system
of
checks
and
balances
that
we
have
in
louisiana
ensures
that
this
individual
receives
due
process
under
the
law.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
that's
true.
possibly
because
i
think
that
you...
the
reason
that
we
haven't
been
brought
back
on
a
yearly
basis
is
to
see
how
he's
doing,
how
far
he's
come
since
that
point
where
he
made
that
first
dangerous
act.
how
far
he's
come
along.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
that's
true,
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
petitioner
did
absolutely
nothing
to
carry
that
burden.
he
put
on
no
witnesses,
he
could
have
put
on
his
own
doctor.
he
could
have
called
family
members
in,
that
could
say,
well,
we're
going
to
help
take
care
of
him,
we're
going
to
see
that
he's
going
to
be
okay
and
keep
out
of
trouble.
he
did
nothing.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
there
is
always
some
risk.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
there's
always
a
risk.
and
the
system
is
set
up
to
try
and
limit
that
risk
of
confining
people
that
should
not
be
confined.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
but--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--but
unlike
what
the
petitioner
says,
he
can
meet
that
burden.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
as
long
as--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--i
think
it
is
a
two-tiered
situation
there.
he
has
to
recover
mentally
and
with
the
dangerousness...
and
not
be
a
danger.
he
can
be
maintained
if
he
is
still
dangerous.
but
he
has
to
be
mentally
deficient
also.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
why
should
they--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--we
cannot
do
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
we
cannot
do
that
because--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--because
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
and
there's
no
way
that
we
can
put
him
in
a
jail
if
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
he's
not
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
he
has
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
he's
done
a
dangerous
act.
but
technically
he's
not
been
convicted
and
he
cannot
be
put
into
prison.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
he
has
to
be
kept
someplace
so
that
people
are
not
endangered
by
these
types
of
individuals.
and
right
now,
this
is...
this
is
the
state's
solution
to
this
problem.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
i
really
don't
know
how
the
state
could
make
it
more
difficult.
they
could
put
more...
i
imagine
they
could
put
more
guidelines
and
maybe
require
the
testimony
of
more
doctors,
because
essentially
what
the
judge
goes
on
is
what
the
doctors
recommend.
in
this
particular
case
dr.
ritter
testified
that
at
the
time...
he
submitted
a
report
to
the
court
saying
that
the
man
was
not
aware
of
his
actions
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
so
based
on
that,
the
judge
found
him
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
perhaps
if
the
legislature
said
what
you
have
to
have
is
a
certain
number
of
doctors,
perhaps
if
they
did
away
with
louisiana
article...
it's
code
of
criminal
procedure
article
558,
which
allows
the
court
to
make
an
adjudication
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
essentially
without
a
trial.
they
essentially
submit
it
on
the
police
reports
and
the
medical
reports,
and
he
looks
at
it
and
says,
okay,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
if
they
required
a
full-blown
trial
in
such
instances,
there
might
be
some
things
that
could
be
done
to
make
it
more
difficult,
but
it
wouldn't
do
away
with
it.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
in
mr.
foucha's
case.
dr.
ritter
at
the
november
29th,
1988
lunacy
hearing
at
one
point
indicates
that...
he
says,
if
this
diagnosis
was
correct,
that
he
could
never
be
certain
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
had
a
drug-induced
psychosis,
or
whether
or
not
he
was
malingering.
and
that
part
of
the
reason
we
have
the
system
set
up
the
way
it
is
to
discourage
people
from
tendering
false...
false
insanity
pleas.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held...
in
salerno,
states
that
the
government's
regulatory
interest
in
community
safety
can,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
outweigh
an
individual's
liberty
interests.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
situations
where
the
good
of
the
many
outweigh
the
needs
of
the
few.
we
have
a
situation
here
that,
if
you
look
at
it
realistically,
i
know
that
the
doctors
at
feliciana
recommended
a
probationary
discharge.
they
said,
okay,
what
we
want
you
to
do
is,
we
want
this
man
to
stay
off
drugs.
we
want
this
man
to
be
gainfully
employed
or
to
be
seeking
employment.
those
were
two
of
the
requirements
for
his
probationary
release.
but
just
from
a
realistic
standpoint,
you
know,
as
far
as
gainful
employment,
how
difficult
is
it
going
to
be
for
this
individual
to
find
a
job
when
he
has
this
type
of
background?
and
what
is
the
guarantee
of
staying
off
drugs?
dr.
ritter
indicated
in
his
testimony
that
should
the
man
get
into
contact
with
drugs
or
alcohol
again,
he
could
again
have
a
drug-induced
psychosis.
he
could
again
become
even
more
dangerous.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
i
think
he
would
need
a
determinate
term.
i
think
that
on
a
statute,
a
criminal
statute,
you'd
have
to
be
aware
of
what
you
are
looking
at.
you
have
to
know,
well,
if
i
commit
this
crime,
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
to
me.
and
that
can
be
vague.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
it's
okay--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--this
is
our
way
of
protecting
society.
it...
it's
a
balancing
test.
whose
needs
are
going
to
be
met
here?
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
because...
because
of
the
position
that
this
person
put
himself
in.
by
the
fact
that
he
had
tendered
a
plea
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity--
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
--not
for
a
criminal,
straight
out
like
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
i'm
not
familiar...
unfamiliar
with
that.
i
assume
that
is
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
moran
no,
it's
not.
i
think
that,
given
the
fact
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest,
a
legitimate
and
compelling
interest
in
protecting
society
at
large,
that
the
due
process
procedures
are
sufficient.
if
you
look
at
the
differences
between
salerno
and
foucha,
even
though
the
government
has
the
burden
in
salerno
and
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
in
this
particular
case,
the
evidence
guideline
is
the
same,
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
you
need
a
judicial
officer
to
make
a
determination
on
the
detention.
under
salerno,
the
arrestee
may
be
detained
if
no
conditions
reasonably
ensure
the
safety
of
the
community.
in
mr.
foucha's
case,
the
court
determined
that
the
conditions
that
were
set
forth
by
the
review
panel
at
feliciana,
the
probationary
conditions,
were
insufficient
to
reasonably
protect
the
community.
in
both
cases,
the
individual
can
have
counsel
at
hearing.
in
both
cases
the
individual
can
testify
himself.
he
can
present
witnesses,
which
mr.
foucha
did
not
do.
he
can
also
present
other
evidence.
he
can
cross-examine
the
witnesses.
in
both
cases,
the
individuals
are
entitled
to
a
written
judgment
and
they
may
seek
appellate
review
or
seek
a
writ
in
the
next
higher
court.
i
think
that
louisiana
has
provided
a
system
of
checks
and
balances.
i
think
that
this
idea
of
this
being
an
indefinite
commitment
is
somewhat
premature.
this
individual
could
have
received
up
to
30
years
in
prison
for
an
aggravated
burglary.
he
has
been
at
feliciana
now
for
about
7
years.
he
has
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
would
even
become
indefinite.
every
year
he
can
come
up
and
try
to
persuade
the
court
that
he
is
no
longer
dangerous.
he
has
not
succeeded
in
the
times
that
he
has
come
up
to
this
point.
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
cannot
succeed
in
the
future
under
the
louisiana
statutory
scheme.
on
the
issue
of
equal
protection,
this
court
in
jones
held
that
the
holding
in
the
jones
case
accords
with
the
widely
and
reasonably-held
view
that
insanity
acquittees
constitute
a
special
class
that
should
be
treated
differently
from
other
candidates
for
commitment.
so
i
feel
that
it
has
already
been
carved
out
a
little
niche
for
insanity
acquittees
as
opposed
to
how
civil
acquittees
are
treated.
and
that
is
legitimate.
i
think
that
the
equal
protection
argument
merges
with
the
due
process
argument.
i
think
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
how
long
can
we
apply
standard
preventive
detention.
how
long
can
we
detain
these
people?
we've
detained
them
before
for,
i
think,
a
maximum
for
17
days
under
shaw
v.
martin,
and
for
longer
times
under
salerno...
maybe
for
a
period
of
weeks.
in
this
case,
even
though
it
is
a
period
of...
of
years,
it
can
be
several
years,
many
years,
still,
i
think
the
court
has
previously
recognized
an
overwhelming
state
interest
in
protecting
the
community.
what
we
are
trying
to
prevent...
we
are
trying
to
prevent
a
situation
where
an
individual,
an
insanity
acquittee,
is
released
and
then
goes
out
and
commits
another
crime.
i
know
we
can't
prevent
all
crimes
from
happening,
it's
impossible
to
do.
but
i
think
the
state
has
an
interest
in
trying
to
do
what
it
can
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
to
prevent
these
people
from
getting
out
and
committing
another
crime,
hurting
another
individual.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
place
louisiana's
statutory
scheme
for
the
detainment
of
insanity
acquittees.
thank
you.
