justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
argument
based
on
the
assumption
that
he
can
be
held
only
for
treatment
and
not
for
preventative
purposes?
doesn't
that
underlie
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he's
dangerous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
then
that
you
must
be
saying
that
without
some
subsequent
hearing,
an
acquittal
by
reason
of
insanity
permits
the
state
only
to
treat
the
insanity
and
not
to
incarcerate
in
order
to
prevent
danger
to
others
or
to
himself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
indefinite,
there's
a
hearing
every
6
months?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
recognize
that
there's
some
negative
aspects
to
it,
but
the
statute
is
fairly
specific.
there
has
to
be
behavior
or
significant
threats
that
support
a
reasonable
expectation
of
a
substantial
risk
that
he
will
inflict
physical
harm
upon
another
person
in
the
near
future.
isn't
that
the
standard
that
has
to
be
met
every
6
months?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
given
he
has
the
burden
of
proof.
and
maybe
you're
going
to
tell
us
that
that's
impossible.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
can
show
that
during
that
period
of
time
there's
been
no
significant
behavior
or
threats.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
clear
that
that
finding
would
have
been
made
if
there
had
been
no
showing
of
the
specific
incident,
i
think
he
put
a
pencil
or
an
object
through
another
inmate's
hand?
are
you
saying
that
that's
just
irrelevant
based
on
the
rationale
adopted
by
the
trial
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
judge
says,
in
this
type
of
case,
i
simply
am
not
going
to
make
a
finding
of
nondangerousness
without
supporting
medical
opinion.
that's
going
to
be
my
policy
here
in
this
court.
and
the
doctors
say,
as
a
medical
matter,
we
simply
cannot
give
you
that
certification.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
close
to
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
true
that
most
psychiatrists
say
that
the
best
way
to
determine
mental
health
and
emotional
balance
is
to
observe
the
defendant
in
a
normal
environment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
a
prison
is
not
a
normal
environment,
is
it?
