justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
in
the
return
as
filed,
only
some
of
the
fees
and
expenses
were
asserted.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
weren't
all
of
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
indicate--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--does
that
indicate
the
taxpayer
felt
they
were
not
deductible?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
that
general
bancshares
and
lincoln
savings
are
in
tension?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
in
tension,
there's
any
inconsistency?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
the...
the
older
case
was
cited
in
lincoln
savings,
anyway,
for
what
that's
worth.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
i've
been
around
too
long,
you
see.
meet
myself
coming
back
on
these
cases.
[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
coming
to
us
from
the
third
circuit.
the
issue
is
the
deductibility
under
section
162(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
professional
fees
and
expenses
the
taxpayer
incurred
in
connection
with
a
friendly
takeover.
the
commissioner
disallowed
the
claim
deductions.
the
united
states
tax
court
ruled
that
the
expenditures
were
capital
in
nature
and
were
not
what
was
called
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
also
affirm
and
we
hold
that
the
creation
of
a
separate
and
distinct
asset
in
the
transaction
of
this
kind
is
not
a
prerequisite
for
capitalization.
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
showing
a
right
to
the
deduction
and
in
our
view,
has
not
carried
that
burden
here.
and
this
too
is
a
unanimous
decision.
