were
the
investment
banking
fees
contingent
on
successful
completion
of
the
transaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
must
say
i'm
having
trouble
with
your
argument
that
if
it's
not
a
separate
and
distinct
asset
then
it
must
follow
that
it's
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the...
that
the
conclusion
follows,
and
that
is
your
argument,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
the
compulsory...
by
the
compulsory
nature
of
this
expense,
let's
assume...
and
you
might
quarrel
with
it
on
the
facts,
but
let's
assume
that
the
company,
the
petitioner
is
correct,
that
they
were
required
as
a
matter
of
corporate
policy,
as
a
matter
of
fiduciary
responsibility,
to
incur
these
expenses,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
compulsory
aspect
of
the
case
somehow
weighs
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
although
i
can't
quite
fit
it
into
a
formulation
as
to
why
that
should
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
when
you
register
stock,
you
have
the
option
to
engage
in
the
transaction
or
not.
here,
at
least
at
the
outset,
they
had...
they
had
no
option
but
to
incur
the
expense,
or
to
make
the
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
do
you
claim
it's
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
under
162?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
isn't
there
a
separate
section
for
research
and
development?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
might
or
might
not,
depending
on
how
the
research
comes
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
to
distinguish
that
between
your
strategic
planning,
from
your
strategic
planning
example.
