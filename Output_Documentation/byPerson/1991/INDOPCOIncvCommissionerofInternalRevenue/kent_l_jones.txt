mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
where
starting
at
the
beginning
really
will
help
us
get
to
the
end,
so
before
i
discuss
lincoln
savings
and
the
reorganization
expense
cases
i'd
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
about
the
fundamental
analytical
issue
that's
present
in
every
capital
expense
case.
the
distinction
between
capital
and
ordinary
expenses
is
rooted
in
the
simple
fact
that
the
federal
income
tax
is
assessed
and
collected
on
an
annual
basis.
in
order
to
reflect
taxable
income
for
each
separate
year,
it's
necessary
to
match
the
income
derived
from
each
year's
activities
with
the
expenses
incurred
to
produce
that
year's
income.
the
problem
that
is
addressed
in
capital
expense
cases
arises
when
an
expense
incurred
in
one
year
assists
in
producing
income
in
more
than
a
single
year.
for
example,
2
years
of
prepaid
rent,
if
it's
deducted
entirely
in
the
current
year
it
would
understate
present
income
and
overstate
income
in
the
following
year,
so
the
function
of
capitalization
is
to
achieve,
as
judge
wisdom
said
in
the
ellis
banking
case,
an
accurate
measure
of
net
income
by
properly
matching
expenses
with
the
income
that
it
benefits.
while
capitalization
is
conceptually
necessary
for
all
expenses
that
create
a
material
future
benefit,
the
goal
of
achieving
an
accurate
measure
of
net
income
is
a
pragmatic
one.
expenses
of
advertising
and
maintenance
create
both
present
and
future
benefits,
but
capitalization
is
not
required
as
a
practical
matter
even
though
some
future
benefit
results,
because
the
current
benefit
predominates
and
the
expense
is
a
regularly
recurring
one,
so
you
achieve
essentially
the
same
statement
of
income
whether
you
deduct
the
entire
expense
in
the
current
year
or
whether
you
amortize
a
portion
that
relates
to
the
future
benefit
each
year.
since
the
current
deduction
for
those
kinds
of
recurring
expenses
would
not
materially
misstate
income,
they
are
allowed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
ordinary
way
to
analyze
that,
if
you're
the
acquiring
party,
and
you
seek
a
hostile
takeover
that
doesn't
succeed,
your
expenses
are
deemed
to
be
capital,
but
they're
deducted
as
a
loss
in
the
year
that
they're
incurred...
i'm
sorry,
in
the
year
that
the
transaction
falls
apart,
and
that
responds
to
petitioner's
suggestion
that
you
have
to
have--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
not
because
an
asset
has
been--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--under
the
government's
theory,
they
are
an
expense
that
was
incurred
to
create
an
asset
that
was
designed
to
have
a
future
benefit,
but
when
the
asset
loses
its
value
by
the
failure
to
conclude
the
transaction,
at
that
point
in
time
we
recognize
the
loss
that
has
occurred
and
allow
it
to
be
deducted
under
165,
not
under
162.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that...
that,
of
course,
is
broadly
speaking
what
this
case
is
about.
reorganization
expenses,
when
incurred
by
a
corporation
to
achieve
future
benefits,
which
is
the
ordinary
situation,
are
capitalized
under
the
structure
of
the
business,
and
as
counsel
has
said,
they
remain
in
the
capital
structure
until
the
ultimate
termination
of
the
enterprise.
they
have
no
determinable
useful
life.
there's
no
basis
to
amortize
or
depreciate,
so
they
remain
in
the
current
structure
until
an
event
of
recognition
occurs,
and
the
recognition
event
for
those
kinds
of
expenditures
is
when
the...
is
when
the
asset
is
destroyed
by
the
termination
of
the
enterprise.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
prior
to
1954,
they
were
treated
the
same.
in
1954,
congress
enacted
section
248
that
allows
organizational
expenses
to
be
amortized.
when
congress
did
that,
the
legislative
history
at
page
a64
of
house
report
1337
shows
that
congress
knew
that
reorganizational
expenses
were
also
capital
in
nature,
but
expressly
determined
that
only
the
organizational
expenses
and
not
reorganizational
expenses
should
be
amortized.
that
was
a
legislative
determination
made
by
congress.
functionally,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
capitalize
them
both
until
the
end
of
the
enterprise,
because
the
benefit
isn't
exhaustive.
the
benefit
of
organization
or
reorganization
isn't
exhausted
in
60
months.
congress
provided
the
privilege
of
a
deduction
for
organizational--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
test
is
a
functional
one
of
properly
matching
expenses
with
the
years
they
benefit
income,
but
it's
a
pragmatic
test
at
the
same
time.
it's
not
pushed
to
extremes.
we
allow...
by
regulation
and
rules
we
allow
advertising
expenses
to
be
deducted
currently,
even
though
to
some
extent--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is...
it
is
possible
to,
as
i've
already
tried
to
do,
articulate
the
functional
test.
given
the
functional
test,
it
is
possible,
and
the
courts
have
articulated
categorical
rules,
but
the
rules
are
subject
to
exceptions.
it
is,
for
example,
a
categorical
rule
that
courts
have
consistently
held
that
reorganizational
expenses
should
be
capitalized.
it
is
a
categorical
rule
that
advertising
expenses,
on
the
other
hand,
may
be
deducted
currently,
but
we
nonetheless
recognize
exceptions.
for
example,
advertising
that
was
designed
solely
to
promote
a
product
not
yet
in
production
would
be
capital
in
character,
and
they
would
be
required
to
be
capitalized
and
either
amortized...
and
amortized
over
some
appropriate
period.
this
court's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i'm
not
dodging
the
question,
i'll
try
to
answer
it,
but
i
think
it
should
be
emphasized
that
that
isn't
presented
here,
and
the
reason
that
should
be
emphasized
is
because
it
depends...
it
depends
on
future
events
exactly
how
that
transaction
should
be
characterized.
what
courts
have
done
in
those
situations...
the
mccrory
case,
the
vulcan
materials
case...
they
have
said
that
even
though
you
dispose
of
the
asset...
for
example,
sell
the
assets
that
you
acquired...
you
nonetheless
retain
in
your
corporation,
the
merged
corporation,
the
capital
costs
of
the
acquisition,
because
you
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
joining
of
the
corporate
forces
even
if
you
dispose
of
some
of
the
assets
later
on.
so
i
think
it's
a
factual
inquiry,
and
different
facts
could
give
different
results,
but
the
ordinary...
the
categorical
rule
on
that
situation
is
well-established.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
unilever--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
and
i
was
trying
to
answer
a
different
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
you're
absolutely
right.
if
unilever
simply
sold
the
stock,
then
the
basis...
the
basis
that
we're
talking
about,
the
capitalized
expenses
we're
talking
about,
are
in
national
starch--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
does.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
are
three
types
of
benefits
that
are...
that
are
acquired
by
indopco
in
this
reorganization.
they
acquired
access
to
capital
possessed
by
unilever.
that's
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--characteristic
function
of
reorganization.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
they
would
enjoy
the
benefit
of
it
during
some
period
of
time,
and
since
there
is
no
way,
a
priori,
to
determine
when
that
benefit
is
exhausted...
i
mean,
they
could
have
received
the
benefit
by
expansion.
the
ordinary
way
that
you
benefit
from
access
to
capital
is
by
expansion.
theoretically
they
could
expand.
they
could
become
three
times
as
big,
and
then
they're
sold.
they've
already
received
and
they
possess
the
benefit
of
that
access
to
capital,
so
there
would
be
no
recognition
event
that
has
occurred
to
provide
for
that
to
be
deducted.
the
second
benefit
that
they
got
from
the
reorganization
was
the
synergy
between
working
with...
combining
their
assets
and
abilities
with
unilever's
business
needs.
there
again,
that
synergy
can
create
benefits
for
them
that
would
exist
even
after
the
entities
had
separated.
for
example,
the
trial
testimony
in
the
tax
court
from
the
indopco
officers
describes
new
ventures
that
they've
begun
to
supply
specialized
raw
materials
for
unilever.
that
kind
of
expansion
of
the
corporation
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
made
possible
by
this
reorganization.
it
is
a
long-term
benefit
which
is
received
by
the
corporation.
it
does
not
terminate
predictably,
and
that's
really
all
we
have
to
talk
about
at
that
point,
is
can
we
predict
now
when
it
will
terminate?
no,
we
can't.
your
question
about
whether,
if
it
was
sold
later
on
how
we
would
treat
it,
is
quite
honestly
a
difficult
question
that
would
depend
upon
a
different
factual
record
and
that
would
require
a
very...
a
difficult
analysis.
i
can't
categorically
dispose
of
the
possibility
that
it
would
be
a
recognition
event
as
you
suggested,
but
i
can
categorically
say
it
might
not
be,
and
that's...
that's
really--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
third--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
third
benefit
was...
was
a
permanent
one.
it
resolved
the
persistent
problem
that
they
had
of
retiring
the
shares
of
a
major
shareholder
in
a
way
that
did
not
interrupt
their
ongoing
business,
and
if
i
might
say
before--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
we
would,
and
that
gets--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
think
you
should
rely
on
them.
i
think
they're
important,
but
there
are
two
separate
tests
that
courts
have
looked
at
in
the
reorganization
expense
area.
the
first,
the
older
test,
is
the
motion
picture
capital
corporation
test,
where
the
court...
the
second
circuit
emphasized
that
reorganization
expenses
don't
provide
any
current
benefit
to
the
corporation.
they
do
not
assist
in
the
production
of
current
income,
they
do
not...
they
are
not
incurred
in
the
ordinary
course
of
producing
income,
certainly
none
of
the
expenses
incurred
by
indopco
have
anything
to
do
with
generating
income
for
the
corporation
in
1978,
the
year
they
were
incurred.
it
is
the
second
test,
as
exemplified
by
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
general
bancshares
for
the
eighth
circuit,
where
the
court
stressed
that
reorganization
expenses
do
provide
a
long-term
benefit
for
the
corporation
and
are
not
devoted
to
current
income
production
or
other
immediate
needs
of
the
corporation,
so
those...
this
is
an
area
where
pragmatic
balancing
of
objectives
is
the
functional
necessity
of...
of
the
study.
when
the
future
benefit
is
predominant
and
the
current
benefit
is
nonexistent,
clearly
that
is
an
appropriate
occasion
for
capitalization.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
there's
no
discernible
benefit
from
an
expense
to
the
business,
period,
then
the
question
may...
i
have
to
ask,
i
would
have
to
ask
in
what
context
that
is
made.
if
you're
talking
about
in
a
reorganizational
context,
then
the
answer
is
that
it
is
not
deductible
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
generating
income
in
the
year
that
it's
made.
it
is
an
expense
incurred
to
achieve
something
that
will
last
into
the
future,
a
reorganizing
of
the
corporation,
and
that
kind
of
organizational
or
reorganizational
expense
is
the
most
characteristic
type
of
capital
expenditure.
well,
this
court
has
struggled
for
over
60
years
and
has
itself
held
that
there
is
no
verbal
formula
that
supplies
a
ready
touchstone.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
recognize
two
possible
outcomes
in
that
situation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
may
be
no
benefit,
there
may
be
no
appropriate
deduction,
but
there
may
also
be
a
future
benefit.
i
mean,
when
a...
it
is
common
in
these
commercial
situations,
when
someone
proposes
a
takeover,
for
them
to
be
resisted,
and
whether
the
degree
of
resistance
is
called
hostile
or
not
hostile
is
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--is
a
difficult--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in...
in
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--opposing,
hostile--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
correct.
there
may
be--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
may
be
a
capital...
it
may
properly
be
capitalized--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
there's
no
current
deduction,
because
it
doesn't
benefit
current
income,
but
in...
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the...
i
think
the
answer
to
that
was...
is
in
the
woodward
v.
commissioner
case,
where
the
court
emphasized
that
you
look
to
the
origin
of
the
expense,
not
its
classification
as
a
fiduciary
expense,
or
whatever.
as
the
tax
court
said
in
this
case,
it
would
let
the
tail
wag
the
dog
to
say
that
these
expenses
were
incurred
out
of
fiduciary
duty.
in
fact,
they
were
incurred
to
facilitate
the
reorganization.
the
origin
of
the
expense
was
the
reorganization,
not
the
fiduciary
duty.
that
argument
would
be
like
saying
that
attorney's
fees
incurred
in
registering
stock
are
simply
designed
to
satisfy
legal
requirements
of
the
sec,
and
so
they're
current.
that's
not
the
way
the
court
has
looked
at
it.
they've
looked
at
what
is
the
function
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
that
they
had
no
option
but
to
incur
a
<two
million
dollar>
[=$
2,
000,
000]
expense.
i
think
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
even
if
they
had
no
option,
if
the
result
of
the...
that's
like
saying
that
you
have
no
option
but
to
pay
other
expenses
that
are
capital
in
nature,
and
there
are
examples
of
that.
if
the
reason
that
the
expense
has
to
be
incurred
is
to
facilitate
a
reorganization,
as
it
was
here,
then
whether
it's
an
optional
expenditure...
you
have
to
have
legal
title
opinions,
you
have
to
do
other
things
to
reorganize
a
company,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it's
not
a
capital
expenditure.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it's...
it's
like
any
other
loss,
justice
scalia.
you
don't
know
when
it's
going
to
happen,
but
when
it
happens
it's
then
deductible.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
suggestion
of
petitioner
that
in
lincoln
savings
the
court
adopted
the
separate
and
distinct
asset
test
as
a
panacea
for
all
capitalization
questions.
in
a
literal
sense,
the
fact
that
an
expense
creates
an
asset
that
is
separate
and
distinct
is
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
for
capitalization.
prepaid
rent
expense
for
6
months
is
a
distinct
capital
asset,
but
it's
fully
deductible
if
it's
fully
consumed
in
the
current
year.
a
ballpoint
pen
is
an
asset,
and
it
may
well
provide
benefits
beyond
a
single
year,
but
it's
fully
deductible
as
a
regularly
recurring
ordinary
business
expense.
goodwill
purchased
in
connection
with
the
business
is
defined
by
regulations
as
a
capital
asset,
but
in
no
real
sense
is
it
a
separate
and
distinct
asset,
because
it
only
exists
in
combination
with
the
other
assets
of
the
corporation.
it
has
no
independent
value.
there
is
a
semantic
circularity
in
this
problem.
from
an
accounting
standpoint,
any
capitalized
expense
would
be
called
an
asset.
to
say
that
an
expense
that
creates
an
asset
should
be
capitalized
is
a
chicken-and-egg
kind
of
problem.
in
lincoln
savings,
the
court
therefore
emphasized
that
the
asset
created
by
the
premium
expenses
that
were
involved
in
that
case
provided
value
to
the
corporation
that
was
more
permanent
than
temporary.
the
premium
expense
was
capital
in
nature
because
it
provides
a
benefit,
quote,
not
only
in
the
current
year,
but
in
the
future,
and
as
justice
blackmun
concluded
in
the
general
bancshares
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
whether
an
expense
is
characterized
as
an
asset
or
not
is
not
itself
critical.
if
the
expense
affords
meaningful
long-term
benefits
for
the
corporation,
it
is
capital
in
nature
because
the
contribution
it
makes
to
the
corporation
is
not
fully
consumed
and
therefore
not
properly
matched
against
income
in
the
current
period.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
are...
are
what?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
there's
any
logical
tension
whatever
between
them.
i
think
that
the
court
in
both
cases
addressed
the
issues
that
were
necessary
to
decide
the
case.
there
was
a...
it
is
a
characteristic
result
in
capital
expense
cases
for
courts
to
focus
upon
the
existence
of
assets,
for
exactly
the
reason
that
petitioners
would
focus
on
that.
there
are...
when
especially
a
tangible
asset
is
seen
to
exist,
a
financial
asset
is
seen
to
exist,
it
is
easier
to
focus
on
the
capital
character
of
that,
but
in
the
general
bancshares
the
court
emphasized
that
whether
there's
a
tangible
or
intangible
asset,
what
is
relevant
is
that
the
expense
provides
long-term
benefits
for
the
corporation,
that
it
would
mismatch
income
to
deduct
all
of
that
expense
in
the
current
period.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
it
was...
well,
since
you
wrote
both,
you
could
best
explain,
but
i
believe
it
was--
[laughter]
i
believe
that
rather
than
being
in
tension,
these
cases
are
perfectly
consistent.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
at
least
in
our
view,
your
honor,
you
were
right
both
times,
and
we
think
if
you
put
those
two
together
the
government's
right
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
i
said
that
in
the
no
possible
benefit
situation
it
was
not
a
current
expense.
i
don't
think
i
went
on
to
say
that
it's
therefore
a
capital
expense.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
if
i
may
answer--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
can
explain
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
the
tax
court
we
argued
that
this
expense
was
either
a
capital
expense
or
a
dividend,
constructive
dividend
to
the
shareholders.
it
would
be
a
constructive
dividend
to
the
shareholders
if
it
was
primarily
for
the
shareholders'
benefit
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
it
would
be
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
the
obligation
was
one
they
owed
to
the
shareholders,
which
is,
i
believe,
the
situation
you
have
in
mind
here,
yes,
that
would
not
change
the
case.
our
position
was
that
if
it
benefits
the
corporation,
then
it's
capital.
if
it
benefited
the
shareholders,
it
was
a
constructive
dividend.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
that,
the
tax
court
didn't
address
it,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
address
it,
but
we
do
think
that
the
findings
of
the
tax
court
support
capitalization
and
do
not
support
dividend
treatment.
the
findings
of
the
tax
court
were
that
this
created
several
long-term
benefits
for
the
corporation.
we
think
that's
sufficient
in
this
case
to
remove
the
issue
of
constructive
dividend
treatment.
we
also
agree
with
petitioner
it
would
be
very
hard
to
sell
to
the
shareholders
that
they...
they
received
any
benefit
from
this
$$
2,
250,
000
fee,
because
all
that
morgan
stanley
recommended
was
a
purchase...
was
that
the
sale
go
forward
at
$
70.
it
was
management
that
insisted
upon
and
obtained
a
higher
price.
i
wanted
to
return,
if
i
could,
to
the
third
benefit
that
indopco
received
from
its
reorganization,
because
it
is
in
its
own
sense
extremely
important.
by
retiring
the
shares
of
the
major
stockholder,
indopco
removed
what
they
called
the
overhang
on
the
market,
of
the
existence
of
that
position.
the
only
way
this
overhang
could
be
removed
was
through
a
reorganization
that
changed
the
common
stock
of
the
greenwalls
to
fixed
value
preferred
stock,
and
the
fixed
value
preferred
stock
was
secured
by
a
$
100,
000,
000
capital
infusion
from
unilever
to
holding.
that's
described
at
page
76
in
the
joint
appendix.
it
is
described
in
somewhat
murky
detail
in
the
exchange
agreement,
which
is
at
page
500
of
the
court
of
appeals'
record.
that
substantial
capital
infusion
solved
a
long-term
problem
for
the
corporation.
there
was
an
additional
$
2,
000,
000
capital
infusion
from
unilever
to
holding
to
starch,
or
indopco,
which
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
retiring
the
employee's
rights
in
the
stock.
they
didn't
hold
stock,
they
held
rights
to
stock.
that
2,
000,
000
retired
those
rights,
which
is
clearly
a
long-term
benefit
for
the
corporation.
now,
that's
described
at
page
564
in
the
court
of
appeals'
record.
these
long-term
benefits
for
the
corporation
bring
this
case
squarely
within
the
rule
described
by
bittker
and
eustice
that
the
reorganizational
expenses
of
an
acquired
corporation
are
not
deductible
currently
but
should
be
capitalized.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
completed.
