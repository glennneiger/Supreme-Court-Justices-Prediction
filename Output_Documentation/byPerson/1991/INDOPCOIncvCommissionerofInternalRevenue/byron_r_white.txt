you
said
these
expenses
were
ordinarily
incurred
in
a
transaction
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
would
have
been
generally
across
the
country,
or
is
it...
was
it
just
because
of
the
requirements
of
delaware
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
actually,
what...
do
you
think...
do
you
think
ordinarily
if
somebody
who
wants
to
acquire
a
corporation
makes
an
offer
to
its
stockholder...
to
the...
to
target
stockholders
that
the
corporation
goes
through
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
whether
or
not
the
law
requires
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
deductible
loss
in
the
year
incurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
here's
the
hostile
takeover
and
it...
and
it
comes
and
goes
and
is
unsuccessful
in
one
year,
and
the
company
spends
a
lot
of
money
opposing
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
an...
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
clear?
does
the
internal
revenue
service
agree
with
that,
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
the...
if
the
transaction
didn't
occur,
there
would
have
been
a
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
unilever
disposed
of
this
company,
they
would
be
selling
the
stock,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
thought
the
question
was...
was
whether
this
is
deductible
by
the
subsidiary.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
you
were
answering
a
different
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
assume--
--what
about
the
situation
where
a
company
unsuccessfully
opposes
a
hostile
takeover,
claiming
that
this
couldn't
possibly
benefit
this
company,
all
it
could
do
is
benefit
the...
these
raiders,
and
that
they
spent
a
lot
of
money
and
they...
and
it's...
and
they
get
taken
over
anyway?
what
about
those
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that
may
be
a
case
where
there's
no
benefit.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
you
say
that
in
this
example
there
would
be
no
current
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
example
i
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
unsuccessful
opposition
to
a
hostile
takeover.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
current...
no
current
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
allow
that
loss
if
they
allowed
it,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
may
have
trouble
identifying
the
property,
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
at
all
in
finding
out
what
it
cost.
