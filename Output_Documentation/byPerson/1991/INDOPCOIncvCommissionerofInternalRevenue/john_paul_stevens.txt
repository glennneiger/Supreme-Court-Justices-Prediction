mr.
hiegel,
could
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
is
it
not
true...
you
said
$
500,
000
was
payable
in
all
events.
that's
only
if
the
negotiations
reached
a
certain
stage
in
their
proxy
solicitations,
isn't
that
true?
as
i
read--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
other
words,
if
they
had
rendered
a
negative
opinion
and
the
negotiations
had
fallen
apart
almost
immediately,
you
would
have
only
paid
about
$
100,
000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hiegel,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
haven't
really
thought
this
through,
but
i'd
like
you...
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
arguably
the
investment
banker
here
was
really
representing
the
selling
shareholders,
and
that
in
one
sense
you
could
have
set
up
a
transaction
in
which
the
costs
of
the...
of
this
$$
2,
000,
000
could
have
been,
in
effect,
charged
to
the
shareholders
in
some
way
and
treated
as
a
cost
of
sale
and
therefore
be
recoverable
as
part
of
the...
you
know,
the
deduction,
reduce
the
amount
of
the
capital
gain
that
they'd
have.
is
that
conceivable,
or
is
that...
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
little
bit
of
uncertainty
as
suggests
who
was
being
represented
by
the
investment
bankers,
the
stockholders
of
the
corporation.
that's
what's
running
through
my
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
most
of
the
fee
went
for
consummating
the
sale
rather
than
for
giving
the
advice.
only
about
$
100,
000
was
for
the
advice,
as
i
understand
it,
which
was
noncontingent.
the
rest
is
a
contingent
fee
on
completing
the
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
go
forward
with
the
transaction
was
governed
by
the
advice
they
got,
which
was
available
for
$
100,
000,
$
150,
000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
clearly
a
corporate
function
there,
but
when
you
go
beyond
that,
aren't
they
in
a
sense
representing
sellers
rather
than
the
ongoing
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
shows
they
had
an
interest
in
having
the
sale
go
through,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
vary
justice
scalia's
question?
you
haven't
gotten
to
your
third
benefit.
i
would
guess
some...
maybe
you
ought
to
tell
us,
what
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
said,
access
to
wealth
and
synergy.
what...
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
let
me
give
you
my
other
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
you
may
want
to
cover
it
at
the
same
time.
supposing
none
of
these
three
features
had
been
present.
supposing
they
sold
to
a
totally
unrelated
company
that
was
no
larger
in
wealth
than
the
existing
shareholders.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
you'd
take
the
same
position
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
really
shouldn't
rely
on
these
factors?
