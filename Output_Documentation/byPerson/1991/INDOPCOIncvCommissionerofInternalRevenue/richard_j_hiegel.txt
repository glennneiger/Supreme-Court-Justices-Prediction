mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
test
should
be
applied
to
determine
whether
an
expenditure
is
capital
in
nature
and
therefore
not
currently
deductible
as
an
ordinary
business
expense
under
section
162(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
is
a
fundamental
issue
arising,
as
the
commissioner
says,
in
virtually
every
area
of
business
activity.
we
contend
that
the
separate
and
distinct
asset
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
lincoln
savings
case
is
controlling,
and
should
have
been
applied
to
determine
that
petitioner's
payments
are
currently
deductible.
the
commissioner,
on
the
other
hand,
would
not
have
any
general
test
and
would
instead
make
a
case-by-case
determination
of
the
test
to
be
applied.
in
this
case,
he
would
employ
a
nonrecurring
future
benefit
test
to
find
that
petitioner's
payments
were
capital
expenditures,
not
deductible
either
currently
or
at
any
time
before
petitioner's
final
liquidation.
the
issue
arises
in
the
context
of
an
unsolicited
offer
by
unilever,
a
large,
multinational
group
of
companies,
to
buy
petitioner's
stock,
which
was
publicly
held.
on
advice
of
counsel,
petitioner
engaged
an
investment
banking
firm
to
value
the
company
so
that
its
board
of
directors
could
make
recommendations
to
the
stockholders
concerning
the
offer.
under
delaware
law,
it
was
required
to
advise
the
stockholders,
and
it
had
to
do
this
whether
or
not
the
stockholders
ultimately
approved
the
transaction.
the
board's
recommendation
turned
out
to
be
favorable,
the
stockholders
voted
to
approve
the
offer,
and
they
closed
in
august
1978.
petitioner
itself
did
not
buy
or
sell
any
stock
or
other
assets.
only
stockholders
transferred
their
stock
to
unilever
corporation.
this
transfer
was
accomplished
in
part
by
a
merger
of
a
transitory
subsidiary
into
petitioner.
before
the
transaction,
the
commissioner
ruled
that
this
merger
should
be
disregarded
and
the
transaction
should
be
treated
as
a
direct
purchase
and
sale
between
the
stockholders
and
the
unilever
corporation.
after
the
stock
purchase,
petitioner
carried
on
its
business
essentially
in
the
same
way
as
before,
without
any
significant
technological
or
other
assistance
from
unilever.
the
investment
banking
and
legal
fees
and
other
expenses
incurred
by
petitioner
were
reasonable
in
amount
and
customarily
incurred
in
transactions
of
this
kind.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
there
was
a
partial
contingency,
your
honor.
there
was
a
$
500,
000
amount
that
was
to
be
paid
regardless
of
the
completion
of
the
transaction
and
an
additional
$
1,
700,
000
in
the
event
it
was
completed.
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
these
payments
were
nondeductible
capital
expenditures
because
they
were
incident
to
a
transaction
that,
in
their
view,
conferred
a
long-term
benefit
on
petitioner.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i...
the
record
does
not
show
why,
your
honor.
the
legal
fees
were
not
deducted
immediately.
i've
been
told
that
it
was
a
mistake,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
tell
us--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--why
that
happened.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
as
i
say,
i've
been
told
that
it
was
a
mistake,
and
i
do
not...
i
do
not
know
any
more
than
that.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
well,
in
many...
most
corporations
today,
i
think,
are
incorporated
in
delaware,
or
states
that
have
similar
laws,
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
any
difference
in
particular
jurisdictions.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
yes,
ordinarily
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i
think
it's
just
basic...
part
of
the
basic
fiduciary
responsibility
of
the
board
of
directors
to
the
shareholders,
particularly
in
a
public
company,
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
offer
is
a
reasonable
offer
and
represents
a
fair
price
to
the
stockholders.
that,
i
think,
is
quite
common
and
ordinary,
and
in
fact
there's
a
case
in
the
delaware...
again
in
the
delaware
courts
that
imposed
liability
on
a
board
if
it...
because
it
did
not
seek
expert
advice
in
this
situation.
the
long-term
benefit
that--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--those
expenses
are
capitalizable,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
a
special
statute--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--was
passed
to
allow
5-year
amortization.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
they
were
capitalized
and
no
deduction
was
allowed
until
final
liquidation.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
and
no
amortization,
because--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--excuse
me--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--sorry,
your
honor.
i
would
say,
no
amortization
in
the
case
where
the
charter
was
perpetual.
where
the
charter
of
the
corporation
had
a
limited
period,
then
amortization
was
allowed
over
that
period.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
well,
that
depends,
your
honor,
on
what
you
mean
by
restructuring.
the
term
corporate
restructuring,
or
capital
structure
changes,
has
been
used
a
great
deal
in
this
cases,
and
it
really
is...
the
cases
look
at
it
in
two
ways,
and
involve
several
different
types
of
situations.
the
first
situation
is
the
organizational
expenses,
and
then
there's
stock
issuance
expenses,
and
changes
to
the
characteristics
of
the
stock
such
as
changing
its
par
value,
increasing
the
authorized
shares.
stock
issuance
expenses
are
looked
at
in
two
ways.
one,
the
courts
say
the
expenses
of
doing
that
is
an
offset
to
the
amount
of
capital
that
is
raised
by
issuing
the
stock,
therefore
there's
no
deduction
because
you're
just
raising
that
much
less
capital.
other
cases
look
at
those...
those
situations
and
say,
there's
a
creation
of
a
capital
asset,
an
intangible
capital
asset,
and
it's
not
deductible
for
that
reason.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
in...
there
is
a
split
of
theory
on
which
those
cases
are
based.
in
each...
in
each
case,
there's
no
deduction
allowed
at
the
outset.
in
the
case
where
it's
held
to
be
a
capital...
intangible
capital
asset,
there
is
a
deduction
allowed
at
the
end
of
the
corporation's
life
under
section
165
of
the
code
or
its
predecessor,
and
in
the
case
where
it's
treated
as
an
offset
to
the
amount
of
capital
raised,
there
would
be
no...
logically
no
deduction
allowed
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
well,
the...
there
have
been
no
cases
dealing
with
hostile
takeovers.
the
internal
revenue
service,
in
certain
private
rulings,
has
changed
its
position
with
respect
to
hostile
takeovers.
originally,
they
said
that
they
were
deductible,
and
then
they
changed
their
view
and
said
that
they
were
not
deductible,
and
then
again
changed
their...
their
view.
the
most
recent
view
expressed
by
the
service
has
just
been
about
2
weeks
ago,
in
which
they
said
they...
those
expenses
can
be
capitalizable
if
the
transaction
results
in
a
future
benefit
to
the
corporation.
in
other
words,
if
the
hostile...
if
the
hostile
takeover
succeeds,
and
the
company
is
actually
taken
over,
those
expenses
can
be
capitalized.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
if
it
does
not
occur,
then
there's
no
transaction
to
which
that
you...
no
benefit,
no
transaction
occurs,
and
the
expense
is
a...
is
a
deductible
loss.
originally
the
theory
of--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--if
the
transaction
does
not
incur...
does
not
occur.
that
might
not
necessarily
be
the
same
year.
if
they're
capitalized
initially,
your
honor,
and
the...
and
the
period
of
time
over
which
it
takes
to
see
whether
the--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--that
would
be
deductible.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i
believe
so,
yes.
there
are
cases
that
so
hold,
unless
it's
successful.
yes...
i
think
the
question
was
whether...
if
it
were
unsuccessful,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
you're...
you're
right.
i
think
it
was
$
200,
000,
but--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--it
was
a
lesser
figure,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
yes.
i
see
no
reason
why
not,
your
honor.
at
any
rate,
to
get
back
to
the
last
statement
of
the
facts,
the
benefit
that
the
courts
below,
the
reason
why
they
capitalized
the
expenditures
in
question,
was
because
of
the
possibility
that
petitioner's
new
parent
might
at
some
point
in
the
future
provide
technological
or
other
assistance
to
petitioner
in
its
business
operations.
we
believe
that
the
separate
and
distinct
asset
test,
rather
than
the
future
benefit
test
as
followed
by
the
courts
below,
is
controlling
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
separate
and
distinct
asset
test
is
the
only
test
for
capitalization
that
is
consistent
with
the
tax
accounting
system
set
up
by
congress
in
the
code,
and
second,
the
future
benefit
approach
has
three
critical
flaws.
first,
it
is
not...
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
tax
accounting
system;
secondly,
it
fails
to
provide
any
principle
or
basis
for
distinguishing
between
admittedly
deductible
expenses
and
expenditures
that
have
to
be
capitalized;
and
thirdly,
it
will
generate
unending
controversy
because
of
its
inherently
subjective
and
speculative
nature.
before
addressing
these
points,
i
would
like
to
mention
that
the
commissioner
would
not
necessarily
apply
a
future
benefit
test
in
every
case,
and
indeed
he
does
not
support
the
formulation
of
the
future
benefit
test
that
the
court
below
indicated.
however,
we
believe
that
his
position
is
even
more
at
odds
with
the
statute
and
would
further
undermine
predictable
and
evenhanded
administration
of
the
tax
law.
let
me
now
address
those
points
in
turn.
in
lincoln
savings,
this
court
held
that
the
presence
of
an
ensuing
benefit
having
some
future
aspect
was
not
controlling
as
to
the
capital
nature
of
an
expenditure.
what
was
important
and
controlling,
it
held,
was
that
the
payment
served
to
create
or
enhance
a
separate
and
distinct
asset.
it
also--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--we
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
and
follow
the
process
of
reasoning
of
the
court,
that
it
would
require
the
result
in
this
case.
that
position
has
been
taken
by
the
courts
of
appeals
in
cases
following
lincoln
savings,
the
treasury
department
believed
it,
and
it
was
a
premise
on
which
congress
enacted
section
195
of
the
code.
however,
if
all
of
those
cases
and
the
treasury
department
and
the
congress
were
wrong
about
that,
and
what...
what
the
court
meant
to
do
was
only
to
say
that
it
found
an
asset
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--that's
correct.
it...
certainly
it's
a
possibility,
but
it
does
not
mean
that
that
is
not
the
correct
test.
certainly
the
court
did
not
reject
in
that
case
separate
and
distinct
asset
as
a
general
test,
and
we
think
that
it
should
adopt
that
test
as
a
general
test
for
the
reason
i'm
about
to
state,
and
the
reason
is
that,
as
i
said,
that
this
is
the
only
test
that's
consistent
with
the
tax
accounting
system
in
the
code.
as
the
cases
in
this
court...
this
court
and
other
courts,
and
as
the
commissioner
agrees,
the
goal
of
the
system
is
not
simply
to
disallow
a
current
deduction
and
thereby
tax
gross
income.
rather,
the
intention
is
to
spread
out
the
effect
of
a
capital
expenditure
over
its
revenue-producing
life.
the
system
does
this
by
providing
for
the
recovery
of
these
capitalized
costs
through
depreciation
or
amortization,
or
by
deduction
from
the
proceeds
realized
upon
a
sale,
or
upon
another
disposition,
such
as
by
abandonment.
in
each
and
every
case,
the
code
sections
that
perform
this
function
require
that
there
be
a
property
or
an
asset
with
a
basis,
or
else
they
just
don't
apply.
for
example,
section
167
allows
depreciation
for,
quote,
property
used
in
the
trade
of
business,
and
determines
the
amount
of
depreciation
by
reference
to
the
basis
of
the
property,
which
is
its
cost.
the
regulations
under
section
167
allow
amortization
of
an
intangible
asset.
section
1001
computes
gain
or
loss
by
reference...
on
a
sale
by
reference
to
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property.
since
costs
are
capitalized
under
the
lincoln
savings
test
only
where
there's
an
asset
or
an
item
of
property,
then
the
taxpayer
has
the
means
of
recovering
his
cost
through
those
statutory
provisions,
and
therefore
the
test
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
well,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
we
don't
have
a
corporate
restructuring.
we
do
not
have
the
kind
of--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i
think
restructuring,
your
honor,
is
an
example
that...
an
exception,
really,
that
proves
the
rule.
it's
the
one
case...
it's
really
the
one
case
where
there
isn't
an
asset
that
can
be
depreciated
or
amortized
or
where
the
cost
can
be
recovered
on
sale
or
abandonment.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
it's
the...
it's--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--well,
as
i
said
before...
as
i
said
before,
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
those
cases,
your
honor.
one
is
that
the
amounts
expended
to
raise
capital
are
simply
an
offset
to
the
amount
of
capital
raised,
therefore
it...
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
considered
an
asset
or
not.
you
just
have
less
capital.
you
don't
have
a
deductible
expense
or
an
intangible
asset,
either.
but
if
you
look
at
them
as
an
intangible
asset,
then
it
just...
it
just
happens
to
be
the
one
case
where
there
is
no
recovery
until
final
liquidation.
that
does
not
mean
that
that's
a
good
system,
and
in
fact
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
congress
enacted
section
248
of
the
code
because
it
was
not
satisfied
with
a
situation
where
organizational
expenses...
expenses
had
to
be
capitalized
and
there
was
no
recovery
of
those
costs.
after
all,
we
have
a
net
income
tax
system,
not
a
gross
income
tax
system.
the
objective
is
not
to
tax
gross
income,
it's
to
recover
costs
in
a
rational
way
during
the
period
that
they
are
producing
revenue
over
the...
over
the
life
of
those
expenditures.
capital
structure
is
just
one
case
where
there
is
no
definite
life,
and
as
i
said
before
also,
if
there
were
a
definite
life,
it
is
amortizable,
so
you
do
have
a
means
of
recovery
in
that
case.
it's
only
where
the
charter
is
perpetual,
which
happens
to
be
the
case
with
most
corporations,
but
that's
just
the
facts
of
life.
there
is
that
one
situation.
that
does
not
mean,
i
think,
that
we
should
adopt
a
rule
that
in
the
generality
of
cases
every
time
that
you
capitalize
an
expense
without
an
asset
to
which
it
can
be
assigned
as
a
basis,
you
have
no
recovery
whatsoever.
you
have
no
way
of
recovering
that
cost
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
that
there
was
a...
i
think
what
the
finding
was,
your
honor,
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
future
benefit.
i
think
you
do
have
to
accept
that.
we
are
not
arguing
that
that
is
not
a
correct
finding,
but
that
is
not
relevant
to
the
ultimate
result
in
this
case,
in
our
view,
because
that
is
not
the
appropriate
test.
future
benefit
is
not
the
appropriate
test,
it's
the
separate
and
distinct
asset
test
that
is
the
appropriate
test,
and
there
was
a
finding
by
the
courts
below,
and
a
statement
to
that
effect
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
particular,
that
there
was
no
asset
found,
there
was
no
asset
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
an
asset
in
this
case.
what
the
court...
what
this
court
did
in
lincoln
savings,
when
it
talked
about
a
separate
and
distinct
asset,
was
to
look
at...
it
said
it
was
a
recognized...
a
distinct
and
recognized
property
interest.
in
other
words,
it
read
the
words
asset
and
property
in
the
code
in
their
normal
meaning,
which
is,
of
course,
the
paramount
rule
of
statutory
construction,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
and
it
looked
at
the
characteristics
that
a
property
interest
would
normally
have;
transferability,
the
ability
to
earn
income,
to
be
used
to
satisfy
other
obligations
or
to
be
exchanged
for
cash,
the
fact
that
it
was
accounted
for
as
an
asset
for
accounting
purposes,
and
presumably
could
not
be
misappropriated
by
anyone
else
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
it
is
my
argument
that
if
there
are
other
requirements
in
section
162(a),
it
has
to
be
paid
or
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business,
necessary
in
the
sense
of
being
appropriate
and
helpful,
so
that
the
only
word
that's
in
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
it's...
it's
an
ordinary
expense.
that
word
apparently
has
two
meanings,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
one
is
that
it's
usual
and
customary,
and
the
other
is
that
it's
not
a
capital
expenditure,
and
yes,
if
it
is
not
a
capital
expenditure,
and
if
it
meets
the
other
requirements
of
section
162(a),
then
it
should
be
allowed
as
a
deduction.
if
it
is
not
allowed
as
a
deduction,
it
will
never
be
recovered.
as
i
said
before,
the
government...
and
let
me
just
address
that
point
for
a
second.
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
we
would
get
this
deduction
on...
we
would
get
a
deduction
on
final
liquidation.
that
assertion
rests
on
the
cases
that
deal
with
capital
structure,
where
they
held
that
it
was
an
intangible
asset
and
the
asset
was
lost
on
liquidation,
but
the
section
under
which
that
was
allowed
as
a
deduction
was
the
predecessor
of
section
165,
and
section
165
now,
and
did
then,
requires
that
in
order
to
have
a
deductible
loss,
it's
limited
to
the
basis
of
property.
so
if
you
don't
have
property,
if
you
don't
have
an
asset,
there
is
no
deduction
under
those
cases,
and
therefore
there's
no
deduction
under
the
commissioner's
position
here,
ever.
if
we
don't
have
a
change
in
capital
structure,
then
there...
there
is...
no
asset,
even
arguably
is
no
asset
to
which
this
cost
can
be
assigned,
and
we
never
get
a
deduction,
and
that
would
be
true
even
if
it
were
known
at
the
outset
that
the
life
of
this
benefit...
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
future
benefit,
an
even
more
concrete
one
than
was
found
by
the
courts
below,
but
it
would
only
last
for
10
years.
let's
assume
that
unilever
had
to
dispose
of
the
stock
of
the
company
in
10
years,
for
whatever
reason,
so
we
knew
it
would
only
last
for
10
years.
you
would
think
that
under
a
rational
net
income
tax
system
you'd
be
able
to
write
off
that
cost
over
that
10-year
period
when
you
were
realizing
the
benefit,
or
at
least
that
you'd
get
a
loss
at
the
end
of
that
period,
a
deductible
loss
under
165.
the
answer
is,
you
would
not
get
a
loss.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
code
that
would
give
you
either
the
write-off
over
the
10-year
period,
or
the
loss,
because
there
is
no
asset.
each
of
those
provisions
depends
on
there
being
property
or
an
asset
with
basis.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i
think
it's
theoretically
possible
that
could
be
the
situation.
the
facts
in
this
case,
however,
show
that
it
was
not
the
situation.
the
investment
banking
firm
was
hired
by
the
board
to
enable
it
to
decide
whether
unilever's
offer
was
a
fair
price.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i...
i
don't...
well,
the
fact
that
it
was
contingent
on
completing
the
transaction
i
don't
think
indicates
necessarily
that
they
were
acting
for
the
stockholders,
your
honor.
it's
just
that
their
liability,
because
they--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--that's
correct,
but
once...
once
if--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--i
don't...
i
don't
see
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
what
they
did
to
help
the
sellers.
they
did
not
negotiate
this
transaction.
in
fact,
when
unilever
originally
made
their
offer
of
$
65
to
$
70,
they
reported
back
to
the
board
that
they
thought
that
was
a
fair
price,
and
it
was
the
board
that
didn't
think
that
it
was
a
fair
price,
and
asked
them
to
go
back
and
tell
them
we
want
$
80
a
share,
and
it
ended
up
at
$
73.
50
a
share.
so
they
really
didn't
act
on
behalf
of
the
corporation...
on
behalf
of
the
shareholders
at
all.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
they
had
an
interest
in
having
the
sale
because
their
liability
was
greater.
if
their...
if
their
opinion
was
in
the
proxy
statement
and
was
published
to
the
stockholders,
then
they
would
have
much
greater
liability
because
of
giving
that
opinion
than
just
advising
the
board.
they
were
then...
they
were
then
answerable
to
this
whole
group
of
public
stockholders
if
their
opinion
was
negligent
or
didn't
take
into
account
the
proper
factors,
and
that's
why,
typically,
the
court...
the
fees
are
much
higher.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
i'd
like
to
return
to
a
point
that
mr.
jones...
an
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
concerning
hostile
takeovers.
you
asked
him,
justice
scalia,
what
would
happen,
what
kind
of
deduction
would
be
allowed
if
there
were
a
hostile
takeover
that
turned
out
to
be
unsuccessful,
and
counsel
answered
that
there
would
be
a,
sort
of
a
suspension
of
the
costs,
and
then
when
it
turned
out...
it
proved
out
that
the
transaction
was
unsuccessful,
the
takeover
was
unsuccessful,
the
company
had
successfully
resisted
it,
that
there
would
be
a
loss,
a
deductible
loss.
now,
the
only
provision
in
the
code
that
allows
a
deductible
loss
is
section
165,
and
the
amount
of
the
deduction
that
is
allowed
by
that
section
is
limited
to
the
basis
of
the
property.
it
says,
for
the
purposes
of
subsection
(a),
which
is
the
subsection
that
allows
the
loss,
the
basis
for
determining
the
amount
of
the
deduction
for
any
loss
shall
be
the
adjusted
basis
for
determining
the
loss
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
property.
so
there's
no
loss
unless
you
have
property
with
a
basis.
now,
where
is
the
property
in
the
case
of
the
hostile
takeover?
there
is
no
property.
the
company
itself
has
no
property.
the
company
that's
trying
to
do
the
takeover
is
trying
to
acquire
stock--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--no,
we
would
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
illuminates
the
flaw
in
their
theory.
their
theory
is,
any
time
you
have
a
future
benefit
you
have
to
capitalize
it.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
that's
correct,
whatever
it
is,
whatever
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
yes.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor,
and
that's...
and
that's
what
we
claim
with
respect
to
these
expenses.
these
expenses
did
not
produce
any
property,
and
i
disagree
with
counsel's
answer
to
the
question
about
current
benefit.
there
was
no...
these
expenses
did
not
produce
revenue,
but
they
did
help
the
board
discharge
its
fiduciary
obligations.
now,
a
lot
of
expenses
a
corporation
incurs
that
don't
produce
any
benefit,
particularly
a
publicly-held
company...
you
have
to
send
reports
to
the
sec,
you
have
to
send
reports
to
stockholders,
you
have
to
comply
with
safety
regulations,
you
have
environmental
laws,
things
that
would
actually
hinder
your
revenue-producing
capacity.
nevertheless,
there's
no
question
that
these
are
deductible.
these
are
things
that
a
company
has
to
do
in
order
to
carry
on
business
as
a
company,
and
just
because
they
don't
produce
a
current
income
doesn't
mean
they're
not
deductible
as
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
under
162(a),
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
origin
of
these
costs.
counsel
mentioned
the
woodward
case.
the
woodward
case
held
that
the
costs
were
capitalizable
because
they
adhered
in
the
process
of
acquisition.
the
taxpayer
before
the
court
in
that
case
was
the...
was
the
company
that
was
making
the
acquisition.
this
company
here
is
the
target.
it
is
not
making
any
acquisition.
the
origin
of
its
expenses
was
the
fiduciary
duty
that
the
board
had
to
the
stockholders,
not
any
process
of
acquisition
by
the
company
itself.
the
other
point
that...
that
i
think
reveals
a
flaw
in
the
government's
position
about
future
benefit,
it
just
doesn't
account
for
a
whole
host
of
expenses
that
everyone
would
agree
are
deductible.
advertising
the
courts
recognize,
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
advertising
has
a
future
benefit.
strategic
planning,
companies
have
whole
departments
devoted
to
strategic
planning
for
the
future...
nothing
but
the
future.
those
deductions
are...
those
expenses
are
clearly
deductible.
companies
could
not
carry
on
business
without
doing
things
that...
that
affect
their
future
revenue,
and
for
long
periods
of
time
in
the
future,
and
yet
they...
they
are
deductible.
there's
no
question.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
research
and
development
is
a
separate
section,
that's
correct,
because
there
you
would
have
an
asset.
you
are,
in
research
and
development--
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
--that's...
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
that
is
a
special
section
in
the
code
designed
to
encourage
research
and
development.
it
is...
it
does
not...
it
does
not
indicate
any
question
of
principle
of
capitalization.
it
is
acknowledged
to
be
a
special
benefit,
like
depletion
allowance,
for
example,
that...
to
give
benefits
to
the
oil,
to
encourage
the
oil
and
gas
exploration.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
my
strategic
planning...
it
is
deductible
without
regard
to
any
special
section
of
the
code,
without
regard
to
any
such
section
as
section
174,
because
there
is
no
asset
created.
mr.
richard
j.
hiegel
thank
you,
your
honor.
