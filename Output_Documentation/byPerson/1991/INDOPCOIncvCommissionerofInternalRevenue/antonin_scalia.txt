but
mr.
hiegel,
you've...
you've
said
that...
why,
you
said
that
these
costs
in
other
instances,
for
example,
where
they
are
the
costs
of
restructuring
a
corporation,
are
ultimately
recoverable
when
the
corporation
is
dissolved.
that's
the
point
at
which
that
asset,
if
you
want
to
consider
it
an
asset,
is
finally
disposed
of,
when
the
whole
corporation
is
dissolved.
why
doesn't
that
solve
your
incompatibility
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand,
but
you're
making
a
theoretical
argument--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
unless
you
use
a
separate
asset
theory
you
can
never
recover
this
money,
but
you
can,
when
the
corporation
is
dissolved,
as
you
do
with
respect
to
restructuring
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
must
be
wrong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
must
be
wrong,
too,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
what
happens...
what
happens
in
this
case
if
unilever
later
disposes
of
this
company,
so
that
the
value
that
you
think
has
been
acquired
in
this
transaction,
the
value
of
the
association
with
unilever,
disappears.
can
they
take
the
deduction
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
yes,
but
you
say
that...
you
say
that
what
they
have
acquired,
that
the
long-term
asset
they've
acquired
is
the
asset
of
the
close
association
with
unilever,
which
gives
them
all
sorts
of...
all
sorts
of
benefits.
that's
how--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
describe
it
in
your
brief,
so
i'm
saying,
what
happens
when
unilever
says,
get
out,
you
know,
we're
selling
it
to
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
that
would
disappear
when...
when
unilever
disposed--
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
answer
when
there's
no
benefit...
when
there's
no
benefit?
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
stevens'
question...
no
discernible
benefit.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what...
what
happens...
can
you
give
other
instances
of
expenditures
that
you
don't
know
whether
they're
capital
or
current
expenditures
until
you
wait
and
see
whether
the...
whether
the
thing
is
successful
or
not?
i
mean,
i
find
that
very
strange,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
client
comes
to
me
and
says,
do
i
deduct
this
this
year,
or
not,
and
you
say
well,
you
know,
have
to
wait
and
see.
if
it's
a
successful
takeover,
no;
if
it
is
unsuccessful,
it's
an
ordinary
expense.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see,
you're
allowing
it
to
be
deducted
as
a
loss
when
it
happens,
not
as
a...
i've
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
about
the
situation
again
in
which
the
company
is
now
owned
by
one
large
corporation,
the
stock
is
acquired
by
another
one.
there
is
no
conceivable
benefit
to
the
company
at
all,
it
is
solely
a
benefit
to
the
stockholders,
the
company
is
not
acquiring
any
new
connections,
or
any
access
to
capital
that
it
didn't
have.
on
what
possible
theory
can
you
say
that
this
has
to
be
treated
as
a
capital
expenditure?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
if
the
corporation
was
obliged
in
law
to
make
these
expenditures?
