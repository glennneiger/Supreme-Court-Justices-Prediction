counsel,
may
i
ask,
now,
what
about
the
expenses
of
organizing
a
corporation
to
get
started
in
business?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
a
special
statute
was
passed,
was
it,
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
allow--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--some
deduction,
and
before
the
passage
of
that
statute,
how
were
those
expenses
treated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
no
amortization?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
expense--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see;
and
how
about
expenses
of
restructuring
a
corporation,
a
corporate
reorganization?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
your
answer
is
that
there
is
a
split
of
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
a
hostile
takeover?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
it
is
not,
if
it
does
not
occur?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
hostile
takeover,
and
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
xxx--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
government's
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
expenses
of
reorganization
or
merger?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
initial
corporate
expenses
are
treated
differently
to
set
up
the
corporation
initially?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
do
you
think
the
test
is,
mr.
jones,
for
knowing
what
must
be
capitalized
and
what
isn't?
what
is
the
taxpayer
to
apply
as
the
test
in
preparing
a
return?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
possible
to
articulate
the
test
in
any...
at
any
level
of
generality,
and
isn't
the
tax
law
an
area
where
it's
desirable
to
have
some
kind
of
clear
standard?
