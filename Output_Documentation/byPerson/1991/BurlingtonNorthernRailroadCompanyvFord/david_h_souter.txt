justice
souter
ms.
christian,
if
you
win
this
case,
is
it
sufficient
for
us
to
decree
that
montana
must...
in
effect
the
montana
courts
must
allow
domestic
corporations
to
be
tried
in
any
county?
justice
souter
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
what
do
we
do
right
now?
justice
souter
but
you
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
montana
supreme
court
to
provide
the,
as
it
were,
the
more
favorable
alternative
relief
that
in
effect
would
get
you
out
of
this
county.
justice
souter
i
think
maybe
if
i
may
interrupt
you
again,
maybe
that's
in
part
what
was
provoking
my
question,
and
i
may
simply
be
wrong
about
the
statute.
i
thought
the
montana
statute...
well,
montana
had
a
statute
in
which
the
domestic
corporation
simply
had
the
power
to
designate
its
principle
place
of
business
and
that
that
was
binding
for
venue
purposes.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
souter
so,
in
effect
it's
a
question
of
fact,
it's
not
something
that
is,
as
it
were,
within
the
control
of
the
domestic
corporation
simply
by
putting
the
name
of
one
town
down
when
it
files
its
annual
return.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
montana.
respondents
are
railroad
workers
who
sued
their
employer,
the
petitioner
here,
in
trial
court
for
yellowstone
county,
montana.
the
petitioner,
burlington,
a
company
incorporated
in
delaware
with
headquarters
in
texas,
moved
for
a
change
of
venue
to
the
trial
court
of
hill
county,
montana
saying
that
it
had
its
principal
place
of
business
in
montana
in
that
county.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
and
the
supreme
court
of
montana
affirmed.
under
montana's
venue
rules,
a
company
incorporated
in
montana
may
be
sued
only
in
the
county
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
the
company
incorporated
elsewhere,
on
the
other
hand,
may
be
sued
in
any
of
montana's
56
counties.
burlington
says
that
this
discrimination
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
montana
and
hold
that
the
montana
rules
are
constitutional
because
they
rationally
further
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
montana
could
have
assumed
that
a
company's
headquarters
are
a
greater
importance
to
its
convenience
in
litigation
than
a
company's
other
offices.
that
companies
incorporated
in
montana
likely
have
headquarters
in
montana
and
that
companies
incorporated
elsewhere
likely
do
no
have
headquarters
in
montana.
on
these
assumptions,
montana
could
reasonably
decide
that
only
the
convenience
to
a
corporate
defendant
of
litigating
where
its
headquarters
are
is
sufficient
to
outweigh
a
plaintiff's
interest
in
suing
in
the
county
of
his
choice.
burlington
has
failed
to
show
that
the
assumption
that
corporate
defendants
incorporated
outside
of
montana
are
unlikely
to
have
their
headquarters
in
montana
is
irrational.
besides,
burlington
has
its
headquarters
in
texas
and
is,
therefore,
in
no
position
to
complain.
