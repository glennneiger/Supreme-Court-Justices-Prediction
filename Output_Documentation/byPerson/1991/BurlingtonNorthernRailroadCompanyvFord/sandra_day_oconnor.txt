why
do
you--
justice
o'connor
--why
do
you
suppose
all
the
lawsuits
are
filed
in
yellowstone
county?
justice
o'connor
in
that
juries
are
more
responsive
to
plaintiffs
in
those
counties?
justice
o'connor
how
many
states
have
laws
like
montana's,
mr.
klein?
justice
o'connor
well,
does
montana,
though,
require
a
foreign
corporation
to
designate
some
place
in
montana
as
a
principal
place
of
residence?
justice
o'connor
there...
does
montana
law
provide
for
the
designation
of
someone
in
the
state
on
whom
suit
can
be
served?
justice
o'connor
and
that's
a
matter
of
public
notice,
and
anyone
can
easily
find
that,
i
suppose.
