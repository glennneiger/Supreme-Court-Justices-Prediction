justice
scalia
well,
what
about
a
foreign
corporation,
as
would
be
the
case
for
most
of
them,
i
suppose,
whose
executive
offices
are
not
in
the
state?
justice
scalia
but
montana
has
given
it
an
artificial
meaning
for
domestic
corporations.
a
domestic
corporation
can
have
its
major
plant
at
one
place
and
do
almost
all
its
business
there
but
have
its
executive
offices
somewhere
else,
and
it's
where
the
executive
offices
would
be
that
would
be
the
principal
place
of
business.
justice
scalia
well,
why
can't
it
say,
you
know,
just
as
with
the...
we'll
treat
it
just
the
same
as
domestic
corporations.
we
will
treat
your
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state
to
be
where
your
executive
offices
are,
and
if
they
are
not
in
the
state,
tough
luck,
but
we're
treating
you
equally.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
i
mean
if
it
were
discovered
that
corporations...
just
statistically
it
happens
to
be
true
that
corporations
whose
names
begin
in
z,
many
more
of
those
have
such
headquarters
than
corporations
that
begin
with
other
letters,
you
wouldn't
allow
a
law
that
said
only
those
corporations
whose
names
begin
in
z
can
be
sued
solely
where
their
chief
headquarters
are.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right,
but
why
isn't
it...
if...
why
isn't
it
just
as
arbitrary
to
say
well,
just
because
it
happens
that
domestic
corporations
are
more
likely
to
have
a
headquarters,
why
do
you
have
to
write
off
those
that
aren't
domestic
but
do
have
a
headquarters?
justice
scalia
i
suggest
not,
any
more
than
with
corporations
whose
names
begin
in
z.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i...
is
that
all
it
takes
to
be
rational,
is
to
pick
some
factor
that
puts
the
majority
of
people
in
that
classification
so
that
you
could
pick,
you
know,
males
with
blue
eyes,
and
if
that
happens
to
correspond
to
a
majority
of
situations,
that's
a
rational
classification,
even
though
you
could
just
as
readily
identify
the
particular
individuals
with
the
characteristic
you're
concerned
about,
such
as
residence?
justice
scalia
that
is
likely
to
be
true.
so
what?
justice
scalia
if
there
are
other
companies
that
just
as
well
have
their
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state,
why
do
you
have
to
write
them
off?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
burlington
northern
to
be
saying
that
you
have
to
pick
a
certain
criterion,
nor
do
i
understand
that
to
have
been
what
saunders
said,
but
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
look,
corporations
are
artificial
entities...
they
don't
really
exist
anywhere.
i
mean,
they
don't
have
a
residence,
they're
not
people,
but
if
you're
going
to
allow
your
domestic
corporation
artificially
to
acquire
a
residence,
and
thereby
to
be
suable
only
in
one
place,
you
have
to
let
out-of-state
corporations
artificially
acquire
a
residence.
we
don't
care
where
it
is.
it
could
be
where
they
file
with
ct,
if
it's
in
helena,
or
it
could
be
where
their
principal
drugstore
is,
or
it
could
be...
make
up
whatever
you
want,
but
you
have
to
allow
them
to
acquire
a
residence
if
you
let
your
domestic
corporations
do
that.
why
isn't
that
a
rational
rule?
justice
scalia
you're
quite
right.
let
me
put
it
the
other
way.
why
isn't
it
irrational
to
say
we
are
only
going
to
let
our
domestic
corporations
acquire
a
residence?
justice
scalia
--it's
just,
you
can
set
up
a
delaware
corporation
and
have
the
necessary
papers
filed
down
there
to
have
that
your
headquarters
for
corporate
purposes
but
yet
you
really
run
your
business
out
of
detroit
or
some
place.
justice
scalia
mr.
klein,
what
if
you
have
a
delaware
corporation
that
has
its
principal...
it's
headquarters
in
montana?
they
can
still
be
sued
anywhere
in
montana.
