mr.
klein,
can
i
interrupt
you
right
on
that
point
about,
isn't
it
not
possible
that
a
corporation
in
montana
could
designate
helena
as
its
principal
place
when
it
incorporates
and
have
its
corporate
office
there
for
that
purpose,
but
in
fact
have
its
major
commercial
offices
located
at
the
other
end
of
the
state?
justice
stevens
if
that
were
true,
which
would
be
the
principal
place
of
business?
justice
stevens
where
it
designated
in
its
charter,
even
though
the
president
in
fact
worked
in
the--
justice
stevens
right,
so
it's
even
true
within
montana
that
you
could
have
the
same
kind
of...
for
a
domestic
corporation
you
have
the
same
situation
you
could
have
for
a
foreign
corporation,
where
it
designates
a
registered
agent
in
helena
but
it
actually
has
all
its
corporate
business
run
out
of
another
city.
justice
stevens
then
i
don't
understand
the
difference
as
you
explained
it
to
justice
scalia
when
you
posited
each,
the
domestic
and
the
foreign,
could
have
the
same
situation
with
a
designated
registered
agent
in
town
a
but
have
most
of
their
business
in
town
b.
justice
stevens
then
why
isn't
that
true
of
a
division
in
montana
also?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
and
we're
also
talking
about
montana,
but
the
same
rule
presumably
could
apply
to
michigan
or
new
york
as
well,
where
you
have,
you
know,
the
same
kind
of
problems.
justice
stevens
we're
primarily
concerned
with
out-of-state
plaintiffs
and
out-of-state
torts
for
the
most
part,
i
take
it.
that's
where
this
becomes
significant.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
certainly
the
plaintiff
didn't
pick
this
forum
because
it
was
most
convenient
to
the
plaintiff.
i
mean,
neither
the
accident
occurred
there,
nor
the
plaintiff
has
any
connection
with
this
forum.
