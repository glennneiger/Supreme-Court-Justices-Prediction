ms.
christian,
let
me
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
your
client,
the
burlington
northern,
has
its
principal
place
of
business
in
dallas,
doesn't
it?
justice
blackmun
is
fort
worth...
what's
it
doing
down
there?
you
know,
originally
it
was
the
old
cb&q...
chicago,
burlington,
and
quincy.
those
are
not
texas
names,
and
the...
its
original
basic
place
of
business
was
in
minnesota.
how
come
dallas
and
fort
worth?
justice
blackmun
none
of
which
had
anything
to
do
with
texas.
justice
blackmun
these
things
can
really
be
maneuvered
rather
easily.
justice
blackmun
well,
that's
an
old
part
of
montana
that
everybody's
known
about
for
years
and
years.
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
blackmun
i
say,
that's
an
old-established
town
on
the
main
line
that
everyone
has
known
for
years
in
montana.
what's
wrong
with
it?
