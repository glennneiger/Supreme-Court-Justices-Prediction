justice
kennedy
you're
asking
us,
it
seems
to
me,
to
say
that
it
is
rational,
almost
necessary,
for
every
state
to
enact
a
scheme
whereby
foreign
corporations
have
a
single,
principal
place
of
business
in
that
state.
now,
that
may
apply
to
your
client,
but
that
isn't
the
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause
rational
basis.
this
is
not
narrow
tailoring,
where
your
client
is
entitled
to
the
narrowest
possible
statute
to
bring
it
into
conformance
with
domestic
corporations.
the
state
need
legislate
only
on
a
rational
basis
with
respect
to
all
out-of-state
corporations,
and
many
of
those
corporations
may
have
no
principal
place
of
business,
or
no
office
that
can
be
equated
to
that.
justice
kennedy
yes,
but
you're
saying
that
it's
irrational
for
the
state
not
to
treat
foreign
corporations
differently
on
a
basis
of
several
subclasses,
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
plausible,
quite
rational,
for
the
state
to
treat
all
foreign
corporations
similarly,
and
the
only
way
you
can
make
your
argument
is
by
saying
that
some
foreign
corporations
have
a
principal
place
of
business,
but
i
don't
know
why
we
are
required
to
say
that
the
state
is
entitled,
or
is
required
to
legislate
on
that
narrow
assumption.
justice
kennedy
except
for
those
dozen
states,
do
the
other
states
generally
require
the
foreign
corporation
to
designate
a
principal
place
of
business
within
the
state?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
that
true...
you
say
there's
never
been
any
litigation
on
this.
is
there
anything
to
prevent
us
from
making
the
assumption
that
it's
a
conclusive
presumption
of
correctness
that
that
is
the
principal
place
of
business
simply
because
the
corporation
so
designates
it?
justice
kennedy
but
there's
no
designation
made
in
the
corporate
papers
or
in
any
other
filing
by
the
corporation.
