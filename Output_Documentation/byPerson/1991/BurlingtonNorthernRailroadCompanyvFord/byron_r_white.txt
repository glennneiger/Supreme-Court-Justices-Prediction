justice

ms.
christian,
what...
if
you
counted
up
all
the
foreign
corporations
that
are
doing
business
in
montana,
how
many
of
them...
what
percentage
of
them
do
you
think
would
have
what
you
would
call
a
principal
place
of
business
in
montana?
justice
white
i
would
suppose
there
would
be
a
lot
of
them
that
didn't
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
montana.
justice
white
and
you
wouldn't...
if
you
were
representing
one
of
those
companies
that
didn't
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
montana,
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
about
them--
justice
white
--they
could
be
sued
in
any
county
in
the
state--
justice
white
--is
that
right?
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
let's
just
assume,
then,
that
there
are
corporations
doing
business
in
montana
that
do
not
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
montana,
such
as
your
client
does.
let's
just
assume
that.
now,
those
companies
could
be
sued
in
any
county
in
montana
without
violating
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
mr.
klein,
do
you
think
the
equal
protection
standard
was
properly
stated
in
saunders?
it
said
that
the
classification
should
not
be
arbitrary,
but
it
should
be
based
on
a
real
and
substantial
difference
having
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
subject
of
the
particular
legislation.
is
that
the--
justice
white
--so
do
you
think
that
montana's
law
could
pass
the
standard
stated
in
saunders?
justice
white
well,
mr.
klein,
i
take
it
that
a
montana
corporation
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
a
particular
county
can
only
be
sued
there,
is
that
it?
justice
white
why
should
a
corporation,
just
because
it's
foreign,
be
capable
of
being
sued
in
just
any
county?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
it
may
be
that
it's
very
convenient
to
sue
a
domestic
corporation
at
their
principal
place
of
business,
but
does
it
necessary
follow
that
a
foreign
corporation
that
doesn't
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
montana
can
be
sued
anywhere?
justice
white
well,
that's...
i
take
it
it
has
to
follow--
justice
white
--according
to
your
argument.
justice
white
why
shouldn't
the
equal
protection
clause
say
that
if
you
only
allow
a
domestic
corporation
to
be
sued
in
one
county
a
foreign
corporation
may
only
be
sued
in
one
county,
and
a
foreign
corporation
is
entitled
to
state
where
it
can
pick
out
a
county
that
it
can
be
sued
in.
justice
white
or
the
state
may
designate
a
county
to
be
sued
in.
justice
white
well,
that's
what...
you've
let
the
domestic
corporation
pick
a
place.
