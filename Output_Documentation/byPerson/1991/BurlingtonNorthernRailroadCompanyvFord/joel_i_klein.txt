mr.
joel
i.
klein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
montana's
venue
laws,
like
those
of
virtually
every
other
jurisdiction
in
this
country,
treat
residents
and
nonresidents
differently.
petitioner
acknowledges
legitimacy
of
that
basic
distinction,
but
objects
to
one
aspect
of
its
application...
montana's
decision
to
treat
its
domestic
corporations
as
residents
while
denying
that
status
to
foreign
corporations
who
simply
have
an
office
in
the
state.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
justice
o'connor,
the
answer
is
that
there
are
probably
a
dozen
or
so
states
that
draw
distinctions
similar.
the
problem
is,
each
state
has
a
different
venue
law,
so
for
example,
some
states
say...
and
these
are
cited
in
petitioner's
petition
on
pages
21
to
23,
but
some
states
will
say
that
if
you're
a
nonresident
you
can
be
sued
in
the
county
of
a
plaintiff's
residence,
so
they're
not
identical,
but
i
think
there
are
something
like
a
dozen
states
that
draw
these
kinds
of
distinctions.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
think
that's
right,
i
think
there
are
a
handful
or
so
that
do
that.
other
states
don't
use
single
place
of
business.
in
other
words...
and
that's
a
key
distinction
between
saunders.
a
lot
of
states
provide
that
any
corporation
can
be
sued
wherever
it
has
an
office.
montana
hasn't
gone
that
way.
that
was
the
statute
in
saunders,
and
it
seems
to
me,
justice
kennedy,
that's
a
very
different
statute.
if
it
says,
look,
wherever
you
have
an
office,
you're
amenable
to
suit,
now
you're
a
foreign
corporation,
and
wherever
you
have
an
office
it's
not
going
to
be
a
limitation,
that
does
seem
to
me
to
be
an
arbitrary
distinction.
but
montana
has
its
own
scheme,
and
i
think
it
rests
on
this
rational
justification,
and
that
is,
the
montana
legislature
could
rationally
have
concluded
that
domestic
corporations
tend
to
have
an
important
attribute
that
foreign
corporations
like
petitioners
lack,
and
that
attribute
is
a
single,
easily
identifiable
headquarters
in
the
state
of
montana.
that
attribute,
that
single
identifiable
headquarters,
is
rationally
related
to
montana's
distinction
for
two
reasons:
first,
having
that
headquarters
relates
to
the
kind
of
convenience
considerations
that
affect
venue,
and
second
of
all,
having
such
a
headquarters
means
there
won't
be
litigation
over
where
the
venue
is
located.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
because
the
preliminary
criteria
is
absolutely
arbitrary.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
because
it
seems
me,
justice
scalia,
we
don't
write
them
off.
we're
saying
is
there
a
rational
basis
to
distinguish
the
two
categories.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
develop
the
distinction.
that
is,
the
montana
legislature
says
we're
conferring
venue
based
on
residence
because
that
is
convenient
in
the
sense
that
the
reason
we
have
a
residence
law
is
people
want
to
be
close
to
their
litigation.
now,
if
you
have
your
corporate
headquarters
in
montana,
that's
where
your
chief
executive
officials
are
going
to
be,
that's
where
your
chief
legal
counsel
if
you
have
one
is
going
to
be,
that's
where
your
books
and
records
are
going
to
be.
that
is
your
litigation
hub
as
a
rule,
and
that's
all
the
equal
protection
clause
asks,
is
let's
look
across
the
spectrum
of
these
corporations.
as
a
rule,
if
we
have
a
montana
corporation,
people
incorporate
in
montana,
unlike
delaware,
to
do
their
business
in
montana.
their
executive
offices,
we
rationally
believe,
are
a
litigation
hub.
now,
for
a
foreign
corporation
like--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
you
put
your
finger
on
the
distinction.
it's
not
simply
that
there's
a
correlation.
there's
a
reason
to
expect
the
correlation,
justice
scalia,
and
that
reason
is,
if
you
incorporate
in
montana,
you're
going
to
have
your
executive
offices,
as
a
rule,
there.
that's
what
the
montana
legislature
has
decided.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
it's
not
a
question
of
writing
it
off.
when
you
administer
a
rule
like
this,
justice
scalia,
there
are
some
people
who
are
going
to
fall
on
the
outside.
let's
take
a
simple
rule.
if
you're
18
years
old,
you
can
drive
in
montana.
if
you're
17
you
can't.
there
are
some
people
who
are
17
who
are
very
good
drivers,
but
the
state
doesn't
have
to
make
an
individual
determination.
the
state
has
to
look
across
a
category.
now,
i
suggest
to
you,
if
you
take
the
following
two
groups
that
petitioner
is
talking
about,
one
is
those
corporations
that
incorporate
in
the
state.
are
they
likely
to
have
their
headquarters,
their
executive
officials,
and
litigation
hub
in
the
state?
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
if
you
take
foreign
corporations,
they
may
or
may
not.
burlington
northern's
litigation
may
be
handled
out
of
forth
worth.
it
may
be
handled
any
place
within
the
state
out
of
a
division.
second
of
all,
if
you
have
a
headquarters...
and
this
is
important
to
venue
law...
it's
easy
to
know
where
to
sue.
there's
no
dispute.
you
know,
in
the
history
of
montana
there's
never
been
a
single
lawsuit
about
where
is
the
residence
of
a
domestic
corporation,
and
i
think
that's
important
because
that
issue
is
subject
to
interlocutory
appeal.
so
what
it
means
is,
plaintiffs
know
where
the
domestic
headquarters
of
a
montana
corporation
is
going
to
be.
it's
an
easy
place
to
find,
and
indeed,
as
counsel
points
out,
it's
now
expressly
designated,
but
it
was
always
designated
in
that
we
knew
where
the
chief
executive
official
was.
now,
if
you're
a
foreign
corporation...
excuse
me.
if
you're
a
foreign
corporation,
and
let's
just
say
you
have
five
different
drugstores
in
montana
and
your
executive
offices
are
in
chicago,
there's
no
readily
identifiable
place
to
call
residency.
the
fact
that
you
may
have
a
few
more
employees
or
a
few
fewer
employees
in
a
particular
place
doesn't
answer
that
question.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
not
the
case.
there
was
an
earlier
statute
going
back
to
1895,
in
which
the
option
of
designating
a
chief
office
was
available.
i
believe
if
you
look
at
the
statutes
that
suggests
a
place
where
you
could
file
suit,
serve
papers,
but
the
notion
that
there
is
a
kind
of
principal
place
of
business
within
the
state
is
not
what
montana
requires.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct,
and
in
this
instance...
that's
an
interesting
point,
justice
o'connor,
because
in
this
instance
burlington
northern,
for
example,
has
its
registered
agent
in
helena,
montana.
it's
basically
a
shop
that
serves
as
registered
agent
for
virtually
everyone.
they
don't
claim
that
that's
where
they
should
be
sued,
and
again
i
don't
think
the
state
has
to
accommodate...
the
mere
fact
of
certainty
that
you
have
an
agent
some
place
doesn't
give
you
a
residence.
you
could
put
an
agent
in
the
most
far-away
corner
of
the
state
for
service
of
process,
but
that
would
not
give
you
a
residence,
in
the
same
way
that
a
domestic
corporation
is
entitled
to
say
we
reside
in
this
state.
and
i
would
just
follow
that
with
a
historical
point,
justice
scalia,
is
that
this
is
an
area
where
we're
talking
about
a
tradition
that
goes
back
100-some-odd
years
in
that
as
a
logical
matter
if
a
state
creates
a
domestic
corporation
the
logical
inference
is
that
it's
going
to
treat
it
as
a
residence.
that
inference
is
still
the
rule,
by
the
way,
under
federal
venue
statute
1400(b),
that
your
residence
under
1400(b),
as
this
court
made
clear
in
brunette,
is
where
you're
incorporated,
so
i
think
this
rule
has
both
the
virtue
of
historical
tradition
and
the
virtue
of
practical
significance.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
may
be
a
rational
rule.
i
don't
think
it's
constitutionally
compelled.
don't
get
me
wrong,
i
think
a
state
could
perfectly
well
have
that
rule.
the
reason
why
it's
not--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
the
two
reasons,
justice
scalia,
are
1)
that
domestic
corporations,
because
they
have
their
executive
offices,
literally
do
have
a
functional
residence.
you
know,
when
it
comes
to
a
trial,
if
i
am
the
chief
executive
official
or
the
general
counsel
of
a
montana
corporation,
my
presence
at
the
trial
may
be
important.
that's...
especially
in
a
big
case.
my
direct
access
to
trial
counsel
has
practical
convenience
concerns
that
relate
to
every
venue
kind
of
consideration.
those
are
real.
if
you
need
the
books
and
records
of
the
corporation,
they're
right
there.
they're
accessible.
now,
it
may
be
that
an
individual
foreign
corporation
has
the
same
kind
of
practical
necessities.
i
don't
believe
burlington
northern
does,
but
as
a
rule,
foreign
corporations
don't
claim
to
have
the
same
kind
of
practical
necessity
in
terms
of
venue
considerations
and
accessibility,
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
i
think
saunders
is
a
very
different
case.
the
statute
in
saunders
says
wherever
you
have
an
office
you're
suable.
now,
that
statute,
it
seems
to
me
once
you
say
that
it's
impossible
to
say
that
just
because
you
have
your
certificate
from
another
state
you
shouldn't
be
suable
wherever
you
have
an
office,
but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
montana's
single
residence
notion.
once
you
buy
that
notion,
then
you
have
the
rule
i
gave
you,
and
second
of
all
you
have
the
question
of
administrative
convenience.
if
i
have
my
executive
offices
in
montana,
that's
going
to
be
where
my
business
is.
now,
burlington
northern,
when
it
has
a
regional
system
of
railroads,
is
not
making
statewide
decisions
about
where
to
locate
its
office.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
possible,
but
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--helena
would
be
the
principal
place,
where
it
has
its
executive
offices.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
oh,
i
think...
i
don't
know--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
let
me
change
my
answer,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
question
is
where,
in
fact,
are
your
executive
offices?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
but
in
fact
the
way
that
works
is
that
you
get
sued
at
that
other
city.
you
get
sued
where
your
executive
offices
are
located.
there's
never
been
a
case...
in
other
words,
everybody
in
montana
whose--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--no,
my
point
is
not...
is
where
the
difference
that
i'm
relying
on,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear,
is
where
are
the
executive
officers
of
the
corporation.
that
is
critical
to
venue,
because
those
are
the
people
that
are
most
responsible
for
the
litigation.
that's
where
the
books
and
records
are
most
likely
to
be.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
may
or
may
not
be,
but
you
have
to
understand
we're
talking
about
two
classes
of
corporations.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
it
could
and
i
think
it
does,
but
the
difference
is,
as
a
class
of
corporations,
if
we
know
the
following
thing,
that
they
have
an
office
in
the
state,
is
there
reason
to
think
that
that
office
is
a
litigation
hub
in
the
same
way
that
there
is
to
think
that
an
executive
office
where
the
people
who
ultimately
must
answer
for
the
corporation
are
located,
and
i
think
it's
not,
and
i
think
montana
simply
says
it's
rational
for
us
to
conclude
we've
got
two
categories.
you
always
have
to
factor
in
venue,
and
i
think
this
may
also
address
some
of...
i
hope
address
some
of
justice
scalia's
concerns.
you
always
have
to
factor
in
venue.
every
venue
decision
balances
convenience.
there's
somebody
else
out
there
called
the
plaintiff
who
is
essentially
arguing
i
have
convenience
considerations
too,
here,
and
while
montana--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
think
first
of
all
this
rule
applies,
that
burlington
northern's
talking
about,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
it
would
apply
to
every
in-state
or
out-of-state
plaintiff,
every
in-state
or
out-of-state
tort.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
i
think
that
their
suggestion
that
there's
somehow...
there's
some
floodgate
of
out-of-state
litigation
is,
as
i
think
we--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--that's
not...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
happens
not
to
be
correct,
justice
stevens.
first
of
all,
the
plaintiff
lives
in
sheraton.
that's
about
110
miles
from
billings.
that's
the...
the
nearest
big
city
is
in
billings.
second
of
all,
the
plaintiff
went
there
for
medical
treatment
on
his
knee.
both
plaintiffs
did,
so
their
doctors
were
actually
in
billings.
so
in
this
particular
instance,
although
i
don't
think
that
should
decide
the
constitutional
issue,
there
was
actually
a
nexus.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
not
the
current
standard,
justice
white.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
do,
but
i
don't
think
it
has
to.
i
think
it
has
to
pass
a
much
lower
threshold,
and
i
think
that's
the
point
of
justice
holmes'
unanimous
opinion
in
bain
peanut.
first
of
all,
all
venue
laws
are
going
to
be
somewhat
arbitrary.
there's
no
way
around
it.
it's
a
rule
of
general
application
that
can't
be
tailored
to
each
individual
situation.
second
of
all,
venue
laws
necessarily
are
going
to
inconvenience
one
party
in
part
at
the
expense
of
the
other,
and
i
suggest
to
you
the
reason
why,
since
bain
peanut,
this
court
has
not
had
a
single
one
of
these
cases,
even
though
there's
lots
of
venue
laws
where
you
could
mount
a
similar
type
argument...
you
could
say,
i'm
an
out-of-state
resident.
i
live
in
wyoming,
but
the
truth
is,
i've
got
a
fixed
home
in
montana
where
i
vacation
three,
four,
five,
six,
eight
months,
and
even
though
i'm
a
resident
in
wyoming,
treat
me
as
a
resident
of
montana.
these
kind
of
arguments,
the
books
are
rife
with
these
kinds
of
distinctions
in
venue
law,
and
it
just
seems
to
me
all
a
state
needs
to
say
is
look,
there's
a
plausible
difference.
corporate
law
was
built
on
the
notion
that
a
principal
place
of
business
of
a
corporation
is
different
from
just
a
place
of
business.
that's
a
plausible,
rational
distinction,
and
i
don't
think
montana
or
any
of
these
other
laws
can
be
subject
to
a
whole
lot
more
rigorous
scrutiny,
otherwise
in
a
sense
venue
laws
are
always
challengeable,
anybody
can
show.
it's
no
different,
i
submit,
from
my
hypothetical
that
says
look,
to
get
social
security...
in
califano
v.
jobst,
if
you're
18
years
old,
you
no
longer
get
it
whether
you
need
it
or
not,
and
somebody
could
say
but
i'm
just
like
somebody
who's
under
18,
and
i
need
it.
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
answer
to
that
question,
frankly,
is
not
directly
posed
by
this
case.
in
other
words,
burlington
northern
is
not
such
a
corporation.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
the
equal
protection
clause
in
this
area
doesn't
require
the
states
to
cut
precise
corners.
however,
if
one
were
to
think
that
that
is
a
constitutionally
decisive
case,
i
would
suggest
that
the
right
common
law
thing
to
do
is
to
give
montana
a
chance
to
face
that
question.
i
admit,
that's
a
harder
question
than
the
one
we
face,
but
i
would
think
before
you
strike
a
statute
down
on
its
face,
justice
scalia,
you'd
let
the
state
supreme
court
take
a
look
at
it.
these
venue
rules
sort
of
evolved
just
the
way
you'd
think
they
evolve.
we
started
out
with
a
statute
as
a
territory
that
said
if
you
had
a
residence
you
got
sued
there.
then
we
created
a
corporation,
where
we
said
now,
is
that
like
a
residence,
and
we
said
yes.
then
we
took
another
person
and
said
he's
not
like...
another
corporation
and
said
he's
not
like
a
resident
because
his
home's
in
forth
worth.
now
you're
saying,
which
is
possible,
that
if
somebody
said
look,
i'm
a
delaware
corporation
but
my
executive
offices
are
in
montana,
i'd
say
before
we
strike
down
the
statute
we
give
montana
a
chance
to
make
that
argument.
that's
not
petitioner's
argument.
it
wouldn't
benefit
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
because
i
think
the
justifications
for
limiting
venues--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
justice
white,
i'm...
what
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
it
follows
this
way--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think
it
follows
in
part.
i
think
it
follows
that
montana
can
say
if
you
don't
have
a
chief
executive
office,
then
the
plaintiff's
convenience
is
paramount
and
it
should
pick
the
forum.
but
let
me
just
say
this,
justice
white:
burlington
northern
is
not--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--because
i
think
that
would
say
to
the
state--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
there
are
two
things:
one
is,
can
the
state
designate
it,
the
other
is,
can
the
foreign
corporation
designate
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
point
that
was
raised
before
is
the
foreign
corporation
can
simply
say
yes,
we'll
pick
a
place.
then
they
can--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--we
let
them
pick
a
place,
justice
white,
because
that's
where
they
had
their
executive
offices.
i
don't
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
only
thing
to
prevent
you
from
saying
that
is
the
language
in
the
montana
supreme
court
opinion
that
says
it's
the
principal
place
of
business
and
that
term
has
not
been
designated
in
the
code.
in
other
words,
until
this
year
the
term
principal
place
of
business
meant
in
montana
would
it
customarily
meant
in
corporate
law,
and
in
the
case
i
cite,
what
the
court
in
montana
said
in
the
mapston
case
is
it
said
a
school
district
is
just
like
a
corporation.
we
know
where
its
principal
place
of
business
is
in
this
state.
so
i
think
it's
not
an
arbitrary
designation.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
until
this
year,
you
designated
exactly
where
your
president,
vice
president
and
secretary
and
treasurer
were,
so
that
would
be,
in
fact,
where
your
place
of
business
was.
this
year
you
also
designate
your
executive
offices
as
an
office,
but
up
until
this
year
what
you
would
see
on
the
form
in
montana
are
the
four
chief
officials,
which
i
think
is
in
fact
what
the
executive
offices
are,
and
i
think
that's
the
point
about
venue.
those
are
the
people
ultimately
responsible
for
corporate
litigation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice--
