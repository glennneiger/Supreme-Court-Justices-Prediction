chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-779,
burlington
northern
railroad
company
v.
william
d.
ford
and
thomas
l.
johnson.
ms.
christian,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
this
is
why,
mrs.
christian,
because
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
14th
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
would
say,
then,
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
between
a
foreign
corporation
with
a
place
of
business
in
montana
and
a
corporation...
montana
corporation
that
has
a
principal
place
of
business?
chief
justice
rehnquist
saunders
was
substantially
criticized
and
limited
very
shortly
after
it
was
decided,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
defining
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state
for
yourself,
ms.
christian?
is
burlington
northern
defining
it
for
itself?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
when
you're
talking
now
about
burlington
northern
having
a
principal
place
of
business,
you're
simply
using
your
own
language,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
the
chief
justice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
county
seat
of
hill
county?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
the
eastern
part
of
the
state?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
montana
just
one...
is
montana
itself
a
separate
division
on
the
burlington
northern?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
there
some
lines
which
are
not
in
the
montana
division
which
are
geographically
in
montana?
chief
justice
rehnquist
more
than
one
division,
then,
has
geographical
operations
in
montana.
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
could
burlington
northern
move
its
principal
place
of
business
to
a
very
small
town
in
montana,
the
county
seat
which
had
a
reputation
for
very
small
plaintiffs'
verdicts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
christian.
mr.
klein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
ms.
christian,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--ms.
christian,
it
depends
on
the
kind
of
case,
really.
if
it
were
a
merger
case
or,
you
know,
fighting
off
a
hostile
takeover
or
something
of
that...
certainly
the
chief
executive
could
be
involved,
whereas
i
suspect
the
chief
executive
would
not
be
involved
in
a
personal
injury
action.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
it
has
to.
you
mean
montana
has
no
choice,
it
must
focus
on
what
you
say
it
must
focus
on.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
christian.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-779,
burlington
northern
railroad
company
versus
ford
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
