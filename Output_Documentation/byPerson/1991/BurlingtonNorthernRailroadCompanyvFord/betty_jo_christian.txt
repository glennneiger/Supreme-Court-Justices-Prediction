ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
montana's
venue
law
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
venue
law
provides
that
a
domestic
corporation
can
be
sued
only
in
the
county
in
which
it
has
its
principle
place
of
business
or
in
a
case
where
a
tort
occurred
within
the
state
in
the
county
where
the
tort
occurred.
the
same
venue
law
provides
that
suit
can
be
filed
against
any
foreign
corporation
in
any
of
the
56
counties
in
the
state.
this
rule
applies
even
to
a
foreign
corporation
that
has
been
licensed
to
do
business,
has
named
a
registered
agent,
and
has
established
a
place
of
business
in
the
state.
burlington
northern
is
this
latter
type
of
corporation,
and
the
reason
that
we're
before
this
court
today
is
that
application
of
the
montana
venue
law
has
led
to
these
suits
and
a
number
of
others
being
filed
in
two
particular
counties
in
montana
in
which
suit
would
not
be
proper
if
the
suit
were
against
a
domestic
corporation.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
petitioners
are
not
asking
this
court
to
determine
what
kind
of
venue
law
any
state
should
prescribe.
that
is
strictly
a
matter
for
the
state,
and
they
are
entitled
to
make
it
as
narrow
or
as
broad
as
they
choose.
our
position
is
simply
this:
that
a
foreign
corporation
that
has
been
admitted
to
do
business
in
the
state
and
has
named
its
registered
agent
and
established
a
place
of
business
there
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
same
venue
laws
that
the
state
chooses
to
adopt
for
its
domestic
incorporations.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
this
is
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
14th
amendment,
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
our
position,
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
that
that
basic
issue
was
decided
by
this
court
60
years
ago
in
the
case
of
power
manufacturing
company
v.
saunders,
and
there
are
two
points
that
i
want
to
particularly
emphasize
in
the
argument
today.
first,
that
the
saunders
law
was
squarely
based
upon
the
reality
of
the
substantial
similarities
between
a
domestic
corporation
and
a
corporation
that,
although
incorporated
in
another
state,
has
been
what
this
court
called
domesticated
in
wheeling
v.
lander.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
the
only
criticism
of
saunders
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
rehnquist,
occurred
in
the
starnes
decision
in
a
footnote.
starnes
had
decided,
in
the
context
of
a
texas
venue
law
in
which
geographic
discrimination
was
not
at
issue
that
in
that
particular
case
there
was
in
fact
no
discrimination
at
all
in
practice
between
the
foreign
and
domestic
corporation,
and
in
a
footnote
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
he
simply
stated,
citing
three
decisions
of
this
court,
that
it
is
not
clear
whether
saunders
is
still
good
law.
but
when
those
three
decisions
are
analyzed,
one
of
them...
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
against
brownell...
actually
cited
saunders
and
quoted
from
it
as
establishing
the
standard
that
should
be
applied,
and
simply
went
on
to
find
that
in
that
case,
because
of
the
different
statutory
schemes
that
the
state
had
enacted
related
to
foreign
and
domestic
insurance
companies,
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
the
difference.
the
second
case
was
the
bain
peanut
company
case
authored
by
justice
holmes.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
a
venue
law
which
established
venue
for
a
corporation
of
any
type,
domestic
or
foreign,
in
any
county
in
which
a
cause
of
action
arose,
was
constitutional
although
a
suit
could
be
brought
against
an
individual
only
in
the
county
of
donethal,
and
the
point
there
was
simply
that
there's
sufficient
difference
between
a
corporation
and
an
individual
to
justify
the
different
treatment.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
the
third
case
cited
was
the
allied
stores
case
in
which
the
court
was
concerned
with
a
state
statute
that
provided
a
more
favorable
treatment
for
a
foreign
corporation
than
a
domestic
corporation
and
thus
did
not
involve
the
issues
of
disparate
treatment
for
one
who
is
essentially
an
outsider
to
the
state.
so
we
do
not
think
that
those
cases
in
any
way
undermine
saunders.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary,
saunders
was
actually
the
first
in
a
line
of
cases
that
has
established
a
broad
principle
regarding
the
equality
of
treatment
to
which
a
domestic
corporation
and
foreign
corporations
in
this
domesticated
class
are
entitled.
now--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
that
the
equal
protection
simply
demands
that
foreign
corporations
that
have
been
admitted
to
do
business
and
in
fact
have
a
place
of
business
in
the
state
be
treated
equally
with
domestic
corporations.
now,
the
state
legislature
could
choose
to
equalize
this
in
any
way
that
they
see
fit.
we
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
a
state
legislature
is
unlikely
to
ever
adopt
an
any-county
rule
if
it
has
to
be
applied
to
domestic
corporations.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
the
answer
would
be
to
determine
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
foreign
corporations
of
this
class
be
given
equal
treatment
with
domestic
corporations
and
remand
to
the
montana
supreme
court.
under
the
existing
law,
the
montana
supreme
court
has
decreed
that
a
domestic
corporation
resides
wherever
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state,
and
so
the
equality
would
appear
to
be
one
of
permitting
the
foreign
corporation
that
is
also
operating
a
place
of
business
in
the
state
to
have
venue
only
at
its
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state,
but
i
would
reiterate
that
ultimately
the
decision
is
for
the
state
legislature
and
for
the
state
courts,
and
that
the
equalization
that
is
required
is
simply
equal
treatment
for
the
foreign
corporation
and
the
domestic
corporation.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
think
that
it
would,
and
we
think
in
fact
that
if...
to
do
anything
else
would
require
that
they
overrule
their
own
prior
decisions,
holding
that
the
residence
of
a
domestic
corporation
is
its
principal
place
of
business.
it
might
be
illuminating,
justice
souter,
if
we
look
briefly
at
how
this
disparity
arose,
because
it
doesn't
arise
directly
from
the
statute
itself.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
it
does
not
appear
to
be
that,
justice
souter.
the
statute
talks
about
residence
and
nonresidence,
and
the
montana
supreme
court
decreed
that
a
domestic
corporation
resides
wherever
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
now,
at
the
time
this
case
arose
and
historically,
there
had
been
no
requirement
that
a
domestic
corporation
designate
a
principal
place
of
business.
that
came--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
now,
the
requirement
of
designating
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state
was
added
to
the
statute
just
last
year,
after
this
case
was
litigated,
and
at
the
time
that
it
was
adopted
the
state
also
added
a
definition.
i
believe
the
definition
for
the
domestic
corporation
is
that
the
principal
place
of
business
is
where
its
executive
offices
are
located,
and
so
the
state
itself
has
provided
a
definition
which
would
certainly
be
appropriate
for
them
to
also
do
in
the
context
of
a
foreign
corporation.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
the
concept
of
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state
is
one
that
has
received
widespread
recognition
both
in
montana
and
elsewhere.
in
montana,
for
example--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--it
has
given
it
an
artificial
meaning.
our
contention
is
that
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
the
state
cannot
refuse
to
give
similar
and
appropriate
meaning
to
the
situation
of
a
foreign
corporation
that,
even
though
it
has
its
national
headquarters
elsewhere,
in
fact
has
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
the
equality
would
have
to
reflect
equal
treatment
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
venue
laws,
and
in
the
context
of
the
considerations
that
go
into
venue,
a
foreign
corporation
such
as
burlington
northern
that
in
fact
has
a
major
executive
office
presence
in
the
state,
even
though
its
national
headquarters
is
elsewhere,
cannot
be
treated
differently.
the
uncontroverted
affidavit
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
shows
that
burlington
northern
has
its
division
headquarters
in
hill
county,
montana.
that's
headed
by
its
general
manager
of
the
division.
over
half
of
its
employees
in
the
state
are
there.
so
our
position
is
that,
consistent
with
equal
protection,
a
state
has
the
obligation
to
recognize
that
the
same
factors
that
justify
treating
a
domestic
corporation's
principal
place
of
business
in
montana
as
its
residence
have
equal
application
to
a
foreign
corporation
that
in
fact
has
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
certainly,
justice
rehnquist,
the
state
would
have
full
power
to
adopt
any
bona
fide
definition.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
this
has
historical
precedent
in
montana,
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
historically,
from
1893
up
until
the
late
1960's
the
state
of
montana
required
every
foreign
corporation
that
sought
to
be
admitted
to
do
business
in
the
state
to
file
with
the
secretary
of
state
at
the
time
of
its
admission
a
certificate
that
stated
both
its
principal
place
of
business
outside
the
state
and
its
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state,
so
this
is
something
that
historically
was
recognized
by
the
state
of
montana.
in
addition,
numerous
other
states
in
the
aftermath
of
this
court's
saunders
decision
brought
their
statutes
into
compliance
with
saunders
by
adopting
the
concept
of
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state
as
the
residence
for
a
foreign
corporation.
some
of
them
at
the
same
time
adopted
a
definition
that
would
control
what
that
principal
place
of
business
was.
others
did
not.
others
pleaded
it
as
a
fact
matter.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
justice
kennedy,
certainly
the
state,
as
i
indicated
before,
would
have
the
power
to
set
definitions
for
what
it
considers
to
be
a
principal
place
of
business,
what
it
considers
to
be
enough
to
qualify
as
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state,
and
if
a
particular
foreign
corporation's
contacts
with
the
state
are
not
sufficient
to
meet
that
definition,
then
it
would
not
fall
within,
but
we
cannot
conceive
of
any
bona
fide
definition
that
would
not
include
burlington
northern.
our
position
is
simply
this,
and
i
think
this
is
the
basic
principle
established
by
the
saunders
case,
that
with
respect
to
matters
pertinent
to
venue...
and
that
is,
we're
talking
about
trials
in
state
district
courts...
that
there
is
no
substantial
difference
between
a
domestic
corporation
and
between
those
foreign
corporations
that
have
been
admitted
to
do
business
in
the
state
and
have
actually
established
a
place
of
business
there,
and
that
if
the
court
chooses
to
extend
to
its
domestic
corporations
the
very
great
benefits
that
are
attached
to
limiting
venue
to
the
single
county
where
it
has
its
residence,
then
there
is
no
rational
basis
not
to
extend
that
same
benefit
to
those
foreign
corporations
that
have
been
domesticated,
are
also
doing
business
in
the
state,
and
also
have
what
is
reasonably
considered
a
residence
in
the
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
the
principal
established
by
saunders
which
was
carried
forward
in
cases
such
as
searle
v.
cohn
is
that
in
the
modern
world
the
concept
of
a
foreign
corporation
includes
two
very
distinct
and
very
different
types
of
corporations
with
respect
to
their
relationship
with
the
state.
one
of
them
is
those
that
can
be
treated
as...
can
be
considered
to
be
truly
foreign.
that
is,
those
that
have
only
transitory
relationships,
if
any,
with
the
state,
and
they're
entitled
to
be
treated
quite
differently
from
domestic
corporations.
but
in
the
modern
world
of
multi-state
businesses
there
is
another
very
large
category
of
corporations
which
happen
to
be
incorporated
in
another
state,
many
of
them
like
burlington
northern
and
delaware,
which
may
even
have
their
national
headquarters
elsewhere,
but
which
in
fact
for
all
purposes
related
to
venue
are
no
different
from
a
domestic
corporation,
and
let
me
try
to
illuminate
that
by
explaining
what
we're
really
talking
about
in
terms
of
factors
related
to
venue.
now,
the
respondent
has
emphasized
that
a--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--it's
nationwide
principal
place
of
business
is
in
forth
worth,
texas.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
this
occurred
after
a
merger.
there
were
two
mergers,
actually,
as
you
will
recall,
in
which
the
burlington...
which
formed
the
present
burlington
northern.
the
first
was
the
merger
of
the
old
great
northern,
northern
pacific,
and
the
cb&q
back
in
1970.
then
around--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
texas,
and
burlington
northern
remained
in
st.
paul
with
its
headquarters
there.
subsequently,
in
i
believe
1980,
burlington
northern
merged
with
the
frisco,
which
had
lines
extending
to
the
south
and
going
down
into
the
southwest
and
texas,
and
it
was
after
that
that
burlington
northern
chose
to
move
its
headquarters
down
to
fort
worth,
texas,
because
at
that--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter
corporations
select
their
national
headquarters
and
their
in-state
headquarters
based
on
business
realities
of
where
it
makes
sense
to
run
a
business
from,
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
hill
county
was
chosen
as
burlington
northern's
principal
place
of
business
in
montana
because
that
is
in
the
middle
of
its
only
main
line
running
across
the
state.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
havre,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
it's
approximately
the
center
part
of
the
state.
it's
the
largest
town
on
the
burlington
northern
main
line,
and
it's
located
just
about
the
middle
of
montana,
i
believe,
or
possibly
a
little
bit
to
the--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
betty
jo
christian
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
that
is
burlington
northern's
principal
place
of
business
in
montana.
that's
where
it
has
its
division
headquarters.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
there
is
a
montana
division
which
includes
most
of
the
lines
in
montana.
the
actual
boundaries,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
drawn
based
on
railroad
operations
rather
than
strict
state
boundaries,
so
there
are
some
lines
that
are
in
the
montana
division
that
spill
over
into
idaho
on
the
west
and
into
north
dakota
on
the
east.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
at
the
time
that
this
case
arose,
there
were.
at
the
present
time,
most
of
those
lines
have
now
been
incorporated
into
the
montana
division.
there
are
still
a
few
lines
down
close
to
wyoming
that
are
in
the
denver
division.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
there
are
a
very
few
lines
that
are
still
in
the
denver
division
at
the
time
that
this
case...
that
is
a
very
short
trackage,
down
near
the
border,
the
southern
border
of
montana,
but
at
the
time
this--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
beg
your--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
the
practical
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
plaintiffs
are
going
into
yellowstone
and
cascade
counties
because
they
perceive,
and
burlington
northern
agrees
with
them,
that
the
verdict
that
they
received
in
those
two
counties
is
likely
to
be
far
more
favorable
than
they
would
receive
if
they
sued
in
hill
county--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--precisely,
justice
o'connor,
and
this
is
a
reality
of
modern
litigation.
this
is
why
venue
is
so
important
in
modern
civil
litigation,
and
it's
why
the
protection
afforded
by
a
state
venue
law
that
limits,
as
this
one
does,
venue
to
a
single
county
for
its
own
domestic
corporations
is
of
such
great
importance.
the
difference
to
a
corporation
in
being
subject
to
suit
only
in
one
county,
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business,
and
to
one
that
is
subject
to
suit
anywhere
in
the
state,
in
the
county
that
the
plaintiff
selects
as
the
one
that
it
believes
is
the
most
favorable
to
its
particular
lawsuit,
is
an
enormous
advantage.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
think
that
that
would
be
largely
precluded,
and
certainly
limited
by
the
simple
business
reality
that
you
have
to
have
your
principal
place
of
business
in
a
place
where
it
makes
sense
to
run
your
business.
you
can't
have
900
people
located
in
some
inaccessible
spot
that
is
remote
from
the
business
they're
operating,
and
that's
true
of
domestic
or
foreign
corporations.
the
selection
of
a
principal
place
of
business
is
dictated
by
the
business
realities.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
can't
really
answer
that,
justice
white.
certainly--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
you
would
find
some
in
both
categories,
and
this
is
why
we
emphasize--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--justice
white--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--justice
white--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--i
think
the--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--it
depends
on
how
you
define
principal
place
of
business,
and
that's
rightly
for
the
state--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--if,
under
a
bona
fide
definition
of
principal
place
of
business
they
did
not
in
fact
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
montana--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--then
we
think
that
they
could
appropriately
be
sued
in
any
county,
but
i
would
reiterate
that
this
is
where,
justice
white,
i
think
we
get
into
what
bain
peanut
referred
to
as
allowing
a
little
play
in
the
joints.
now,
with
respect
to
domestic
corporations,
the
state
of
montana
grants
every
domestic
corporation
a
principal
place
of
business
regardless
of
how
small
that
may
be.
now,
with
respect
to
foreign
corporations,
we
think
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
that
every
foreign
corporation
also
be
assumed
to
have
a
principal
place
of
business.
this
is
in
fact
what
montana
for
70
years
apparently
assumed
in
requiring
that
designation
to
be
made,
but
we're
getting
now
into
an
area
in
which
we
think
that
the
states
do
have
some
discretion
to
adjust
at
the
margin.
the
point
is
that
for
those
foreign
corporations
that
do
have
a
principal
place
of
business
in
the
state,
according
to
every
standard
the
state
may
choose
to
adopt,
you
cannot,
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
treat
them
differently
from
the
domestic
corporations
in
the
same
category.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
just
two
points.
first
of
all,
respondent
has
argued
that
the
matter
of
convenience
in
venue
is
entirely
different
for
a
foreign
corporation
and
for
a
domestic
corporation
on
the
theory
that
the
significant
factor
with
respect
to
convenience
in
terms
of
venue
is
where
the
chief
executive
officers
and
the
corporate
records
are,
but
i'd
like
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
just
look
at
what
convenience
in
terms
of
venue
really
means.
we're
talking
about
convenience
in
the
logistics
of
a
trial
in
a
state
district
court,
and
what
that
really
means
is
the
convenience
of
having
an
office
in
which
your
witnesses
can
remain
and
continue
to
get
their
work
done
until
shortly
before
they're
called
on
the
stand
to
testify
instead
of
having
to
leave
town
at
least
one
day
ahead
of
time,
go
to
another
city,
and
stay
in
a
hotel
waiting
to
be
called.
it
means
having
physical
facilities,
your
secretaries
and
word
processors
available,
in
order
to
put
together
exhibits,
in
order
to
prepare
witnesses
for
trial.
this
is
the
sort
of
thing,
the
sort
of
convenience
and
economy,
related
to
venue,
not
where
the
chief
executive
officer
is,
who
is
highly
unlikely
to
be
involved,
and
not
the
place
where
the
corporate
books
and
records
are
kept.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
if
you
need
the
records--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
our
point
is
simply
this
that
in
terms
of
selecting...
of
identifying
convenience
generally,
the
convenience
in
terms
of
state
district
court
litigation
needs
to
focus
primarily
on
the
convenience
of
logistics
in
running
the
trial,
not
upon
in
particular...
where
particular
individuals
would
be.
it's
the
logistics.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice,
montana
has
complete
discretion
as
to
whether
even
to
consider
convenience
or
not.
respondents
have
suggested
that
convenience
is
the
key
consideration,
and
i
was
simply
responding
to
their
argument
in
terms
of,
if
that
is
the
justification,
then
it
applies
just
as
much
to
a
foreign
corporation
that
also
has
a
place,
one
place
from
which
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
centralize
its
litigation,
and
the
mere
fact
it's
incorporated
elsewhere,
or
even
has
its
national
headquarters
elsewhere,
does
not
mean
it
does
not
have
a
single
point
that
would
be
more
convenient.
my
final
point
is
simply
this:
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
the
saunders
case
was
different
from
this
because
in
saunders
the
venue
for
domestic
corporations
was
at
any
place
where
the
corporation
had
a
fixed
place
of
business...
pardon
me,
any
place
of
business,
whereas
for
a
foreign
corporation
it
was
any
county.
what
this
would
mean
in
practice
is
that
if
you
have
a
relatively
broad
venue
statute
for
a
domestic
corporation
so
that
the
disparity
with
foreign
is
relatively
narrow,
then
it's
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
if
you
have
a
vast
disparity,
the
difference
between
one
county
venue
for
the
domestic
corporation
and
any
county
venue
for
the
foreign
corporation,
then
that
passes
constitutional
muster,
and
that
simply
does
not
square
with
any
realistic
notion
of
equal
protection.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
yes.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
traditionally,
justice
thomas,
this
court
has
considered
venue
laws,
challenges
to
venue
laws,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
rather
than
the
commerce
clause.
we
think
that
there
may
be
commerce
clause
implications
here,
but
from
a
policy
standpoint,
this
is
the
way
this
court
has
treated
it,
and
since
it
avoids
a
case-by-case
determination
of
whether
there
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
in
any
particular
venue
law
perhaps
as
applied
to
any
particular
case,
we
suggest
that
from
a
policy
standpoint
equal
protection
is
really
what
venue
laws
is
all
about.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
thank
you.
