mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
appellant
and
appellee
in
this
case
have
one
serious
difference.
the
appellant
believes
its
sovereign
immunity
exists
in
all
instances
under
all
conditions.
the
appellee
suggests
that
sovereign
immunity
doesn't
exist
under
all
circumstances
and
in
all
conditions.
section
106
of
the
bankruptcy
code
clearly
deals
with
the
topic
of
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
neither
section
106
of
the
bankruptcy
code
nor
any
other
provision
of
bankruptcy
law
creates
sovereign
immunity
where
it
does
not
already
exist.
sovereign
immunity
does
not
exist
to
deprive
a
court
of
its
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
that
which
is
in
the
actual
physical
custody
and
control
of
the
court.
i'm
not
speaking
about
property
of
the
estate
in
the
intellectual
control
of
the
court,
i'm
talking
about
dollars.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
to
please
the
court,
this
has
been
argued
in
this
case
from
the
original
complaint.
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
--the
answer
is
no,
the
sixth
circuit
decided
the
case
on
a
sovereign
immunity
issue.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
that
is
correct.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
it
didn't
reach
that
argument.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
it
would.
and
we
did.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
no,
we
did
not.
but
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
this
money
was
in
the
court's
custody,
that
the
sixth
circuit
erred.
i
believe
the
sixth
circuit
posture
that
sovereign
immunity
did
not
prevent
the
lower
court
from
awarding
relief
was
a
recognition
that
the
money
was
in
the
court's
custody,
that
where
it
was
removed
from
the
custody
of
the
court
improperly,
the
improper
postpetition
transfer
by
mr.
lah,
that
what
was
happening
was
a
restoration
to
the
bankruptcy
court
of
a
possession
of
that
which
was
in
the
court's
possession.
this
is
not
a,
shall
we
say,
reduction
of
the
money
in
the
federal
till,
because
it
was
a
restoration.
i'm
the
first
to
acknowledge
in
saying
restoration
is
different
from
a
judgment
to
pay
is
a
play
on
words.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
money
was
being
restored
to
that
place
where
it
belonged.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
if
it
please
the
court,
we
had
the
far
east
lines.
we
go
all
the
way
back
to,
i
think
it's
bull
v.
united
states.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
that
is
the
closest
i
can
come.
there's
bull,
and
there's
another
case
of
that
same
vintage,
your
honor,
united
states
v.
state
bank.
now
they
dealt
with
the
concept
of
restoration.
they
did
not
deal
with
pure
in
rem.
the
in
rem
position,
the
closest
we
come
is
a
ninth
circuit
decision
in
far
east...
pacific
far
east
lines.
and
there
are
other
cases,
such
as
matter
of
retail
stores
delivery--
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
--it's
the
closest
i
can
come,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
yes.
and
state
bank.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
yes,
your
honor.
cites
to
state
bank
are
96
u.s.
30.
bull,
your
honor,
is
295
u.s.
247.
they're
as
close
as
anything
we
have
found.
your
honor,
the
government
position
is
that
sovereign
immunity
is
of
such
significance
that
the
sovereign
is
not
bound,
or
should
not
be
bound
by
determinations
of
courts.
the
ninth
circuit
in
pacific
far
east
lines
clearly
stated
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
did
not
prevent
a
bankruptcy
court
from
compelling
the
return
of
property
which
was
part
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
the
ninth
circuit
went
on
to
say
that
sovereign
immunity
protects
the
property
which
belongs
to
the
government
independent
of
the
bankruptcy
process,
but
where
the
property
has
been
transferred
from
the
bankruptcy
estate,
the
bankruptcy
court
retains
jurisdiction.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
no,
your
honor,
money...
if
it
were
my
pen,
my
pen
might
be
identifiable,
although
this
cheap
papermate
pen
i'm
sure
there
are
many
of.
where
it's
dollars,
they're
a
fungible
commodity.
fortuitously,
in
the
case
at
bar
in
the
lower
court,
as
justice
stevens
notes...
i'm
sorry,
i
believe
it
was
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
money
was
clearly
traceable
in
the
concept
of
a
fixed
number
of
dollars.
mr.
lah
purchased,
with
funds
of
the
debtor
in
possession
that
he
no
right
to
do,
an
official
check
or
money
order
from
the
ameritrust
company
in
cleveland.
that
ameritrust
official
check
indicated
the
remitter
as
nordic
village,
inc,
or
swiss
haus.
i
think
it
said
swiss
haus,
as
i
reflect
upon
it.
mr.
lah
took
that
check
down
the
street...
and
in
the
city
of
cleveland
the
internal
revenue
to
the
ameritrust
main
office
is
about
5
blocks...
went
into
internal
revenue
and
had...
gave
the
check
to
an
internal
revenue
collector
and
asked
that
the
money
be
applied
to
his
personal
tax
obligations.
the
record
below
is
silent
as
to
who
drew
what
i
believe
was
two
or
three
lines
through
the
name
of
the
remitter.
the
court
below
found,
and
the
government
has
not
appealed
or
made
an
issue,
that
the
government
was
on
sufficient
notice
of
the
impropriety
of
the
transfer
of
these
funds,
that
they
were
coming
out
of
a
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
it
said...
i
would
say,
your
honor,
if
we
rely
on
the
theory
of
restoration,
and
the
government
had
knowledge.
we
certainly
have
a
stronger
entitlement
to
restoration
than
if
the
government
were
an
unwitting
party
who
had
been
duped.
our
brief--
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
--the
court
below,
trial
court
and
the
district
court,
felt
it
important
to
determine
that
the
government
knew,
because
under
section
550
of
the
bankruptcy
code
there
are
provisions
where
there's
a
third-party
transferee...
let
me
rephrase
that,
your
honor.
where
the
trustee
is
seeking
to
recover
money
from
the
initial
transferee,
good-faith/bad-faith
knowledge
are
unimportant.
where
the
trustee
is
seeking
recovery
from
one
other
than
the
initial
transferee,
whether
called
immediate
or
intermediate
transferee,
a
question
of
good
faith
or
knowledge
becomes
important.
in
this
case
in
the
court
below,
they
first
found
that
the
government
was
in
fact
the
initial
transferee.
on
the
appellant's
request
in
the
district
court
for
a
modification
of
the
judgment,
then
district
court
judge,
now
chief
district
court
judge
lambrose
concluded
that
either
they
were
the
immediate
initial...
i'm
sorry,
either
they
were
the
initial
transferee,
or
if
they
were
the
mediate
or
intermediate
transferee,
they
were
on
knowledge
and
had
notice.
so
it's
both
pieces
together,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
serious
problem.
the
court
asked
what
the
closest
case
i
could
find
is
or
had,
that's
as
close
as
i
can
get.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
i
hate
to
use
the
expression
standing
in
these
chambers,
but
it's
kind
of
like
horseshoes,
your
honor,
that's
as
close
as
i
can
get
on
that
point.
we
have...
going
directly
to
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
question
of
waiver/nonwaiver.
the
plurality
and
the
dissent...
plurality
and
dissenting
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
hoffman
case
appear
to
agree
that
106(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
was
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
the
federal
government
in
that
the
federal
government,
according
to
the
plurality
opinion,
would
be
bound
by
a
determination
of
issues
by
bankruptcy
courts
even
where
the
federal
government
did
not
appear
and
subject
itself.
which,
of
course,
puts
us
back
to
the
problem
of
what
is
a
determination
of
an
issue
in
106(c).
and
to
deal
with
that,
you
really
have
to
start
by
reading...
and
i
think
in
part
i
answer
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
strange
structure
of
the
language
of
106(c).
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
have
been
a
bankruptcy
practitioner
for
31
years.
i
have
lived
through
the
trauma
of
the
10
years
of
legislation
that
started
with
the
ford
foundation
grant.
so
if
on
occasion
i
slip
off
into
what
i
know,
please
just
check
me
and
say,
hey,
you're
off
base.
106(c)
was
created
in
part
to
cure
different
arguments.
if
we
go
back,
the
bankruptcy
commission,
whose
report
was
beginning
of
the
serious
legislation
that
gave
rise
to
the
1978
bankruptcy
code,
perceived
a
bankruptcy
law
where
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
would
be
all-encompassing,
or
as
we
called
it,
pervasive...
any
matters
arising
in,
arising
out
of,
et
cetera,
which
this
court
found
constitutionally
infirm
in
marathon
as
an
improper
grant.
there
was
also
tied
with
that
a
concept
of
being
able
to
void
multiple
different
pieces
of
litigation
in
nonbankruptcy
forms.
when
you
come
back
to
reading
section
106(c)(1),
if
you
start
in
a
vacuum,
which
is
a
peculiar
way
to
interpret
a
statute,
but
will
help
if
you
indulge
me
in
my
explaining
what
i
believe
is
meant...
if
you
read
a
provision
in
this
title
that
contains
creditor
entity
or
governmental
unit...
applies
to
governmental
units,
which
is
106(c)(1),
read
in
a
vacuum,
unless
intended
to
mean
that
any
provision
that
says
creditor
or
entity
includes
governmental
unit,
106(c)(1)
has
no
meaning.
if
you
are
going
to
read
all
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
then
it
must
anywhere
the
word
creditor
or
entity
appears
it
is
intended
to
include
the
governmental
unit.
if
you
will
go
on
to
106(c)(2),
if
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
determination
means
any
judgment
or
decision
on
any
issue
binds
a
governmental
unit,
then
you
can
take
106(c)
and
you
can
say
that
anywhere
creditor,
entity,
or
governmental
unit
appears,
a
decision
of
the
bankruptcy
court
would
bind
the
governmental
unit.
when
we
get
back
to
hoffman,
this
court
is
troubled
by...
if
106(c)
says
what
i'm
suggesting
it
was
intended
to
mean,
what
is
the
role
of
106(a)
and
106(b)?
the
answer
lies
partly
in
the
fact
that
when
you
read
106(a)
you
find
the
word
claim
appearing
twice.
a
governmental
unit
is
deemed
to
have
waived
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
any
claim
against
such
governmental
unit...
that
was
the
first
claim
word...
that
is
property
of
the
estate
and
that
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
occurrence
out
of
which
such
governmental
units
claim
arose.
the
word
claim
is
used
in
106(a)
as
two
different
concepts.
you
have
a
proof...
you
have
the
definition
of
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
section
101.5
defines
claim
as
a
right
to
payment.
you
also
have
the
writing,
called
a
proof
of
claim,
which
is
dealt
with
in
bankruptcy
code
section
501,
and
in
rules
3001(a).
and
i
should
add
as
a
side
comment,
the
filing
of
a
proof
of
claim
needs
to
be
perceived
as
equivalent
to
the
filing
of
a
short
form
of
complaint
for
money
only
in
a
nonbankruptcy
court.
now
we
deal
with
what
106(a)
means.
if
the
government
files
this
proof
of
claim,
the
piece
of
paper,
because
that's
where
their
claim
arose,
in
the
bankruptcy
court
they
have
agreed
to
be
subjected
to
any
counterclaim
or
cross
claim
that
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction...
the
typical
compulsory
counterclaim
provision
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
so
that
if
the
government
files
a
proof
of
claim
arising
out
of
a
defense
contract
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
creditor,
entity,
governmental
unit...
it
has
filed
a
proof
of
claim
because
the
debtor
hasn't
finished
performing
on
a
defense
contract.
the
debtor
says,
but
i
have
done
more
work
than
you
have
paid
for,
mr.
government,
you
owe
me
money.
that
would
be
the
106(a)
counterclaim
arising
out
of.
interesting,
if
we
read
106(a)
and
don't
recognize
that
the
word
claim
is
being
used
in
two
different
senses,
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
maybe
the
government
doesn't
have
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
for
a
106(a)
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
contrary
to
every
case
i've
read...
which
is
why
i
focus
on
the
dual
meaning
of
claim
in
106(a).
there
is
a
third
meaning
of
claim
that
we
need
to
keep
sight
of.
and
that
is
a
claim
is
a
cause
of
action,
as
we
learned
when
i
was
in
law
school.
so
each
time
we
see
the
word
claim
in
106,
we
have
to
think
in
terms
of
which
meaning
is
it
being
used
as.
when
you
get
to
106(b),
the
offset
provision,
you
have
again
the
word
claim
appearing
twice.
now,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
word...
with
the
structure
of
106(b)
is
it
deals
with
an
allowed
claim.
there
shall
be
offset
against
an
allowed
claim
or
interest.
under
the
provisions
of
chapters
9
and
11,
and
106
is
as
significant
and
applicable
in
chapters
9
and
chapter
11
as
it
is
in
chapter
7...
if
the
creditor
is
scheduled
by
the
debtor
for
the
correct
amount
and
is
not
scheduled
as
being
disputed,
unliquidated,
then
in
that
event
under
bankruptcy
rule
3003(b)(1),
and
section
502
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
creditor's
claim
is
deemed
filed,
and
if
not
objected
to,
will
be
allowed.
if
we
now
look
at
106(b),
if
that
creditor
has
a
deemed
allowed,
deemed
filed
claim
in
a
chapter
9
or
11,
and
it
would
be
more
frequently
an
11
than
a
9...
there
are
very
few
9's...
and
if
we
did
not
have
106(b),
and
if
we
look
at
502(d)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
a
creditor
who
received
a
preference,
or
voidable
transfer
who
does
not
restore
it,
their
claim
shall
be
disallowed.
so
if
the
bankruptcy
court
determined
that
a
governmental
agency
or
unit
got
a
preference,
the
total
claim
could
be
disallowed.
if
the
preference
were
5
dollars,
and
the
governmental
unit's
proof
of
claim
were
50
million
dollars,
the
failure
to
return
the
5
dollars
would
be
a
basis
of
disallowance
of
the
50
dollar
million
claim.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
some
do
and
some
don't,
your
honor.
it
is
the
totality
of
bankruptcy
law.
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
why
(c)
is
in
there--
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
--i'm
trying.
i
suggested
a
few
moments
ago,
your
honor,
i
have
lived
with
bankruptcy
law
and
may
jump
a
little
fast.
and
i
implore
the
court
to
slow
me
down
when
i
go
too
fast.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
i
am
getting
right
at
it.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
what
i'm
suggesting,
simply
put,
is
the
correct
reading
would
be
to
recognize
that
106(c)
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
wherever
the
trigger
words
appear.
in
addition
thereto,
that
where
the
governmental
unit
filed
a
proof
of
claim,
and
the
debtor
has
a
counterclaim
that
is
unrelated
to
the
trigger
words,
that's
what
106(a)
is.
where
the
governmental
unit
has
a
proof
of
claim,
whether
filed
or
deemed
filed,
and
there
is
a
settle
off
or
disallowance,
that
106(b)
will
override
502(d),
and
therefore
the
government
will
only
have
a
settle
off
and
not
a
total
disallowance.
taken
collectively,
it
means
(c)
was
the
intent...
which
goes
right
back
to
where
we
were
with
the
bankruptcy
commission...
of
the
broad
waiver.
additionally,
since
it
is
the
federal
government
whom
we
are
claiming
has
waived
sovereign
immunity,
and
congress
has
passed
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
waiver
does
not
have
to
meet
the
atascadero
standard.
it
is
a
simple
waiver.
it
is
here.
in
substance,
the
waiver
by
congress
in
106(c)
is
a
sufficient
waiver
of
the
federal
government's
sovereign
immunity,
if
there
is
sovereign
immunity
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
unfortunately
takes
us
back
to
the
topic
of,
this
was
property
in
the
custody
of
the
court
and
has
been
removed.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
except
as
provided--
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
--my
hypothetical
of
a
government
contract
claim,
defense
department
contract,
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
section
of
the
code
where
the
word
creditor,
entity,
or
governmental
unit
applied.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
the
government
says,
this
defense
contractor
didn't
finish
work
on
these
torpedoes.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
therefore,
we
had
to
send
the
torpedoes
to
somebody
else
to
do.
we
had
a
cost
overrun
as
a
result
of
that.
we
have
a
claim.
the
chapter
11
debtor
or
the
chapter
7
trustees...
chapter
7
debtor's
trustee
says
we
did
more
work
than
we
had
to,
you
guys
caused
all
the
delay,
defense
department,
you
owe
us
for
the
cost
overruns.
in
fact,
you're
the
guys
who
ended
up
pushing
us
into
bankruptcy
with
your
mickey
mouse
games
that
we
couldn't
finish
your
project.
so
we've
got
damages
for
our
bankruptcy
case
having
to
be
filed
because
of
you.
106(a)
says
even
though
you
don't
have
the
preference,
the
trigger
words,
et
cetera,
you
have
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
if
they
file
that
proof
of
claim.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference.
your
statement
that
it
would
have
been
prudent
to
have
said
in
addition
to
those
provided
instead
of
except
for.
if
you...
and
i'll
watch
my
red
light
quickly...
if
you
take
time
to
read
the
bankruptcy
code
versus
the
bankruptcy
act,
you
will
find
the
writing
style
has
changed.
speculation
is,
on
the
eve
of
passing
the
act
under
pressure,
irs
people
were
drafted
to
help
on
the
drafting.
and
that
explains
why
there
are
certain
similarities
in
some
of
the
language
and
the
drafting
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
the
tax
code.
and
it
is
difficult
reading.
but
i
suggest
that
the
except
means
in
addition
to
that
which
is
provided.
so
that
under
(a)
and
(b)
you
have
jurisdiction
without
trigger
words,
and
under
(c)
you
have
the
trigger
words.
mr.
marvin
a.
sicherman
to
please
the
court,
that
is
one
topic
that
i
cannot
defend.
i
have
said
that
from
1977
onward.
it
is
garbled.
it
is
difficult
to
read.
it
is
not
straightforward.
and
fortunately
i
don't
have
to
defend
the
draftsmen
on
that
topic
in
this
court
today.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
my
time
is
about
up,
i
will
rest.
