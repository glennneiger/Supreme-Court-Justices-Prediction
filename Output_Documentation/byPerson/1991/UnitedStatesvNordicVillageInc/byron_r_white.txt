this
was
not
a
case
that
was
approached
to
court
below,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
decided
the
case
based
on
its
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
didn't
decide
the
case
based
on
the
argument
you
are
now
making.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
it
didn't
use
that.
and
it
seems...
i
think
what
you're
arguing
would
argue
for
a
much
broader
relief
than
the
sixth
circuit
gave
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
cross
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
free
to
accept
his
argument
here?
even
if
we
thought
it
was
pretty
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
to
whether
we
should,
would
it
change
the
judgment
below
if
we
accepted
his
argument?
