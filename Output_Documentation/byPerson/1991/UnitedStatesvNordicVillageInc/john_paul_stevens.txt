justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
get
one
factual
thing
straight,
mr.
seamon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
gather
you
didn't
make
the
sovereign
immunity
argument
in
the
district
court.
and
was
the
reason
for
raising
it
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
hoffman
was
decided
in
the
interim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
in
fact
learned
that
there
was
an
available
sovereign
immunity
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
clear
on
what
you
just
said?
you're
telling
us
that,
in
the
clean
water
act
and
those
other
citizen
suit
provisions,
congress
has
adopted
different
standards
for
the
waiver
of
the
federal
sovereign
immunity,
of
the
waiver
of
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
clean
water
act
citizen
suit
provision,
in
your
view,
is
an
example
of
such
a
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
different
rule
for
the
federal
defendant
against
a
state
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
you
said
there
was
a
difference
and
that's
an
example
of
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
seamon,
under
your
theory
they
can't
recover
the
money.
supposing
the
transfer
had
been,
say
the
government
had
seized
an
automobile
just
before
the...
could
the
debtor's
estate
get
that
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
seized
a
suitcase
full
of
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
get
the
suitcase,
but
not
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
that's
not
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
judgment
below
requires
the
government
to
turn
over
the
money
that
was
wrongfully
transferred
to
it,
right?
and
if
we
accepted
his
first
argument,
you
have
exactly
the
same
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
if
you
accepted
his
argument
that
the
in
rem
theory
he
advances
requires
the
government
to
repay
the
same
amount
of
money
that
would
be
paid
under
the...
then
it
would
be
permissible,
wouldn't
it?
wouldn't
it
be
the
same...
couldn't
we
affirm
the
judgment's
already
been
entered
if
we
agreed
with
his
argument?
i'm
not
saying
we
should
or
would.
