of
course,
the
incompatibility
you
describe
only
exists
if
you
assume
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
was
based
upon
the
rationale
of
the
plurality
opinion.
there's
no
incompatibility
at
all
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
thought
to
have
been
based
on
the
rationale
of
the
concurrence.
that
is
to
say,
it's
quite
feasible
that
congress
may...
might
want
to
waive
its
own
sovereign
immunity,
but
does
not
have
the
power
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
there's
nothing
strange
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
seamon,
do
you
have
any
idea
how
it
occurred
to
anybody
to
draft
(c)(1)
that
way?
i
mean,
instead
of
just
mentioning
the
sections,
pick
out
a
couple
of
words?
why
would
that
occur
to
anybody
to
do
something
like
that?
it's
almost
like
a
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
mean
why
wouldn't
you
just
name
the
sections
instead
of,
you
know,
saying
a
provision
that
contains
these,
what
you
called
trigger
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
never
seen
a
provision
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
property.
you
mean
they
have
the
right
to
get
back
the
same
bills
that
went--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
government
was
on
notice
or
not
if
you're
relying
on
the
theory
of,
what
do
you
say,
restoration
to
the
estate
as
something
that
belongs
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
have
a
stronger
equitable
claim,
but
it
wouldn't
be
any
stronger
as
far
as
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
is
concerned.
i
mean,
you're
either
just
taking
back
what's
yours
or
you're
taking
something
that
belongs
to
the
united
states.
and
if
it's
your
theory
of
restoration
it
really
doesn't...
as
far
as
sovereign
immunity
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
government
knew
about
it
or
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sicherman,
can
you
tell
me
something?
what
puzzles
me
about
106(c)
is
the
first
phrase
of
it.
can
you
explain
to
me,
you
know,
it
says,
except
as
provided
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b).
now
what
the
rest
of
(c)
does,
no
matter
how
you
interpret
the
rest
of
(c),
what
the
rest
of
(c)
does
is
broadly
or
narrowly,
it
waives
sovereign
immunity.
right?
i
mean,
that's
the
only
thing
we're
arguing
about,
whether
it
does
it
in
some
limited
way
as
to
issues
or
does
it
broadly.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the...
how
could
(a)
and
(b)
possibly
be
an
exception
to
what
is
done
in
(c)?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
that
would
not
be
an
exception
from
(c)
at
all,
it
would
be
in
addition
to
(c).
i
mean,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
in
addition
to
and
except
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
seamon,
i
know
you
have
very
little
time
left,
and
i
don't
want
you
to
give
me
what
the
answer
is,
but
is
there
an
answer?
it
would
just
give
me
great
comfort
to
know
that
some
rational
person
thinks
there
is
one,
to
why
(c)
says
except
as
provided
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
is
yet
another
bankruptcy
case
presenting
the
question
whether
section
106(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
in
an
action
seeking
monetary
recovery
in
bankruptcy.
soon
after
the
respondent
nordic
village,
inc.
filed
a
petition
for
relief
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
one
of
its
officers
withdrew
funds
from
the
company's
corporate
account.
he
set
a
portion
of
the
money
to
the
internal
revenue
service
directing
it
to
apply
the
funds
against
his
individual
tax
liability.
the
irs
did
so.
in
a
subsequent
adversary
proceeding,
the
bankruptcy
court
permitted
the
trustee
for
nordic
village
to
recover
the
transfer
and
entered
a
monetary
judgment
against
the
irs.
the
district
court
affirmed
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
which
rejected
a
jurisdictional
defense
that
sovereign
immunity
barred
the
judgment.
we
reverse.
subsection
106(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
does
not
unequivocally
waive
the
united
states
sovereign
immunity
from
an
action
seeking
monetary
recovery.
in
contrast
to
subsections
106(a)
and
(b)
which
plainly
waive
immunity
with
regard
to
monetary
relief
as
to
specify
types
of
claims,
subsection
106(c)
is
susceptible
of
at
least
two
plausible
interpretations
that
do
not
authorize
monetary
relief.
contrary
to
respondent's
suggestion,
legislative
history
has
no
bearing
on
this
point.
the
unequivocal
expression
of
waiver
that
we
require
must
be
an
expression
in
the
statutory
text.
respondent's
alternative
grounds
for
affirming
the
judgment
also
are
unpersuasive.
neither
the
broad
jurisdictional
grant
of
28
u.s.c.
section
1334(d),
the
bankruptcy
courts
in
rem
jurisdiction,
nor
trust
law
principles
supply
the
necessary
waiver.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
