argument
next
in
no.
90-1629,
united
states
v.
nordic
village,
inc.--
mr.
seamon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
explanation,
mr.
seamon,
you
think
(c)
was...
106(c)
was
added
after
(a)
and
(b)
were
already
in
place
in
the
congressional--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
this
was
added?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
seamon.
mr.
sicherman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
is
the
closest
case
from
this
court
that
supports
your
position,
mr.
sicherman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
is
the
closest
case
that
supports
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
i'd
asked
you
about
cases
from
this
court.
bull
v.
united
states
is
a
case--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
it's
from
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
state
bank
is
a
case
from
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sicherman,
don't
you
think
that
your
reliance
on
bull
against
united
states
may
be
somewhat
limited
by
our
later
decision
in
the
dalm
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
said
that
really
bull
just
applied
to
equitable
recoupment
in
tax
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
saying
is
it
may
not
be
very
close,
but
it's
the
best
you
can
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sicherman,
i
think
the
basic
argument
you're
up
against
here,
as
you
probably
realize,
is
that
since
(a)
and
(b)
specify
quite
limited
bases
in
which
sovereign
immunity
is
waived,
how
can
you
read
(c)
in
its
much
broader
language
to
constitute
an
across
the
board
waiver?
do
the
sections
you've
just
been
referring
to
that
would
govern
the
operation
of
(a)
and
(b),
do
they
contain
key
words
or
trigger
words
such
as
are
contained
in
(c)(1)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you've
got
to
make
us
aware
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
not
necessarily
a
question
of
going
too
fast,
but
you
only
have
half
an
hour.
[laughter]
and
i
presume
you're
still
getting
to
the
reason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
you've
got
about
8
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
sicherman,
i
would
say
that
the
tax
code
can
frequently
be
difficult,
but
my
experience
with
the
bankruptcy
code
is
that
it's
frequently
garbled,
which
i
regard
as
quite
different
than
being
difficult.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sicherman.
mr.
seamon,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1629,
united
states
against
nordic
village
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
