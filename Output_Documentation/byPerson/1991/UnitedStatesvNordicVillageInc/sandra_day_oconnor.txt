justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
requirements
for
a
clear
statement
are
the
same
in
waiving
federal
sovereign
immunity
as
they
are
for
finding
abrogation
of
a
state
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
power
of
the
trustee
to
void
a
transfer
and
the
power
to
sue
for
recovery
of
money.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
transfer
section
is
section
549?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
a
transfer
could
be
voided
by
the
court
against
the
federal
government
if
none
of
the
trigger
words
appear
in
549?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
550
applies
even
though
none
of
the
trigger
words
are
in
549?
