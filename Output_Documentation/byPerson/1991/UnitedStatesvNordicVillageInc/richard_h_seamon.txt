mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
appointed
for
the
respondent--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
lacking
one,
and
that
is
an
oversight
for
which
i
apologize
the
court.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that
was
an
oversight
for
which
i
apologize
to
the
court.
the...
to
continue,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
appointed
for
the
respondent
in
this
case,
nordic
village,
brought
this
adversary
proceeding
and
recovered
a
20,000
dollar
money
judgment
against
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
judgement
on
the
ground
that
the
united
states
had
waived
sovereign
immunity
under
section
106(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
thus,
the
issue
is
whether
section
106(c)
of
the
code
authorizes
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
recover
money
from
the
government.
this
court
previously
addressed
the
scope
of
section
106(c)
in
a
case
involving
an
individual
state,
namely,
hoffman
v.
connecticut
department
of
income
maintenance.
in
hoffman,
the
court
concluded
that
section
106(c)
does
not
authorize
monetary
relief
against
the
states.
we
submit
that
the
same
conclusion
should
apply
in
cases
involving
the
united
states.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
undisputed
and
may
be
summarized
briefly.
nordic
village
was
a
restaurant
in
lake
county,
ohio,
that
filed
a
petition
for
relief
under
chapter
11
in
march
1984.
after
the
petition
was
filed,
the
irs
filed
a
proof
of
claim
against
the
estate
seeking
payment
of
overdue
employment
taxes.
also,
after
the
petition
was
filed,
an
officer
of
nordic
village,
josef
lah,
drew
a
check
for
26,000
dollars
on
nordic
village's
corporate
bank
account
which
he
used
to
get
a
20,000
dollar
cashier's
check
payable
to
the
irs.
mr.
lah
delivered
the
20,000
dollar
check
to
the
irs
and
had
them
apply
it
against
his
personal
taxes.
the
trustee
for
nordic
village
then
brought
this
action
seeking
to
recover
the
20,000
dollar
payment
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
an
unauthorized
postpetition
transfer.
the
bankruptcy
court
agreed,
and
held
that
the
transfer
was
voidable,
and
entered
the
20,000
dollar
judgment
against
irs.
and
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
affirmed.
on
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit,
the
government
argued
that
the
20,000
dollar
judgment
was
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
the
government
relied
on
the
decision
in
hoffman.
hoffman,
like
this
case,
involved
a
voidable
payment
of
taxes.
in
hoffman,
as
here,
the
trustee
argued
that
section
106(c)
of
the
code
authorized
recovery.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
don't
think
that
the
government
was
aware
the
availability
of
the
argument
before
then.
in
hoffman,
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
recovery
of
a
voidable
tax
payment
was
authorized
under
section
106(c).
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
white,
a
plurality
of
the
court
concluded
that
section
106(c)
cannot
be
construed
to
authorize
retroactive
monetary
relief
against
the
states.
mr.
justice
scalia
concurred
in
that
conclusion
on
the
ground
that
congress
lacks
authority
under
the
bankruptcy
clause
to
subject
unconsenting
states
to
retroactive
monetary
relief.
in
this
case,
the
sixth
circuit
declined
to
follow
the
plurality's
interpretation
in
hoffman
and
adopted
instead
the
views
of
the
dissenting
members
in
hoffman.
thus,
the
court
upheld
the
judgement
against
the
federal
government,
which
it
recognized
could
not
be
entered
against
a
state.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
they
are
very
closely
similar
and
have
been
described
in
virtually
identical
terms.
i
would
suggest
that
there
is...
there
may
well
be
some
difference
between
the
formulation
in
the
atascadero
case
of
the
clear
statement
rule
and
the
standard
for
federal
sovereign
immunity
cited
in
a
case
like
ruckelshaus.
but
i
don't
think
that...
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
that
congress
would
have
discerned
a
difference
between
the
two
statements,
especially
at
the
time
it
was
drafting
the
code.
and
in
any
event,
i
think
in
drafting
the
statute
at
issue
here,
clearly
it
didn't
intend
to
have
a
different
rule
apply
to
the
states
as
opposed
to
the
united
states
based
on
any
difference
in
the
standards
for
waiving
the
two
forms
of
immunity.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
there
is
nothing
strange
about
that,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
in
certain
other
statutes,
congress
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
suits
against
the
united
states
and
suits
against
individual
states.
i
would
cite
as
an
example
some
of
the
citizen
suit
provisions
in
the
environmental
statutes
like
rcra
and
crcla.
you
can
bring
a
citizen's
suit
against
the
united
states
and
then
against
state
entities
to
the
extent
permitted
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
congress
didn't
draw
the
distinction
in
this
case,
even
though
it
recognized
that
there
were
limitations
on
its
power
with
regard
to
the
states.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
fact
that
it
didn't
draw
a
distinction
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
recognized
a
limit
in
terms
of
its
power
over
the
states
suggests
that
it
wanted
to
waive
federal
sovereign
immunity
to
the
same
extent
it
believed
it
could
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
let
me
be
clearer
than
i
perhaps
was.
i'm
saying
that
when
congress
is
legislating
close
to
the
limits
of
what
it
thinks
that
its
constitutional
authority
is,
and
it
intends
to
allow
actions
against
both
kinds
of
sovereigns,
in
certain
cases
it
will
embody
in
the
statute
itself
its
recognition
that
maybe
some
suits
against
the
federal
government
would
be
permitted,
even
though
the
same
suit
wouldn't
permitted
against
the
state.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
citing
the
clean
water
act
provision
as
an
example
of
where
congress
is
drawing
a
distinction
of
congress'
recognizing--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it's
recognizing
that
there
may
be
a
different
rule,
and
perhaps--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--if
i
did,
i
wasn't
being
clear
enough.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
it's
an
example
of
congress
being
sensitive
to
the
possible
differences
that
may
evolve
in
the
process
of
construing
such
a
statute.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
made
the
latter
finding
that
the
irs
should
have
known
that
the
20,000
dollar--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--they
based
that
finding
on
a
notation
on
the
20,000
dollar
check
stating
that
the
remitter
was
swiss
haus,
inc.,
which
was
the
doing
business
name
for
nordic
village.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we...
i
don't
believe
we
state
that
in
the
brief.
we
stated
that
in
the
petition.
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--your
honor,
we
stated
that
in
our
petition
to
make
clear
all
of
the
issues
that
were
presented
at
the
lower
court.
and
we
also
stated
in
our
petition
that
we
do
not
at
this
level
dispute
the
finding
below
that
the
transfer
was
voidable.
the
findings
by
the
lower
court
regarding
the
notations
on
the
check
were
part
of
its
holding
that
the
transfer
was
voidable.
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
and
that's
why
we
didn't
raise
it
in
our
brief
on
the
merits.
it
is
correct
that
the
incompatibility
in
this
case
only
exists
between
the
result
in
hoffman
and
the
result
reached
by
the
sixth
circuit
below.
nonetheless,
we
believe
that
the
plurality
in
hoffman
construed
section
106(c)
correctly.
it
does
not
clearly
authorize
monetary
relief
against
governmental
units.
and
because
i'm
going
to
begin
by
talking
about
the
language
of
section
106,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix
to
our
petition
at
page
57a
where
section
106
is
reprinted.
section
106(c),
which
is
the
provision
at
issue
here,
was
added
late
in
the
legislative
process
and
in
some
respects,
it
is
not
a
model
of
drafting
clarity.
therefore,
section
106(c)
is
best
understood
in
the
context
of
section
106
as
a
whole.
sections
106(a)
and
(b)
are
the
provisions
that
congress
clearly
designed
to
deal
comprehensively
with
the
problem
of
money
claims
against
governmental
units.
that
is
clear
because
section
106(a)
and
(b)
use
the
word
claim,
which
is
defined
in
the
code
to
mean
any
right
to
payment.
thus,
section
106(a)
and
(b)
considered
together
address
all
money
claims
that
a
trustee
may
have
against
the
government,
whether
they
arise
under
a
provision
of
the
code
or
come
from
a
source
outside
of
the
code.
while
106(a)
and
(b)
are
quite
comprehensive
in
the
sense
that
they
address
all
money
claims,
they're
quite
restrictive
in
setting
forth
conditions
for
recovering
the
money.
106(a)
allows
affirmative
recovery
only
when
the
government
has
filed
a
claim
against
the
estate,
and
the
estate
has
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
that
is
a
very
narrow
category
of
cases
that
would
permit
affirmative
monetary
relief
of
the
sort
that
was
awarded
here.
106(b)
is
slightly
broader
in
scope
inasmuch
as
it
reaches
permissive
counterclaims.
by
the
same
token,
it
limits
the
kind
of
relief
available.
under
section
106(b),
the
trustee
can
only
get
an
offset
of
the
estate's
claim
with
respect
to
the
government's
claim
against
the
estate.
and
as
is
clear,
106(a)
and
(b)
both
apply
only
when
the
government
has
filed
a
claim
against
the
estate.
in
contrast
to
106(a)
and
(b),
section
106(c)
contains
nothing
that
is
suggestive
of
monetary
relief.
it
consists
of
two
subparts,
both
of
which
must
be
satisfied
for
106(c)
to
apply.
together
they
allow
a
court
to
make
a
determination
of
an
issue
arising
under
any
of
over
100
code
provisions
that
contain
one
of
three
trigger
words
that
are
specified
in
106(c)(1).
the
plurality
in
hoffman
construed
the
language
of
106(c)
as
indicative
of
declaratory
relief
rather
than
monetary
relief.
that
is
clear,
in
our
view,
not
only
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
section
106(c)
itself,
but
also
when
106(c)
is
contrasted
with
(a)
and
(b),
whereas
(a)
and
(b)
refer
broadly
to
claims,
and
clearly
indicate
that
congress
was
thinking
of
monetary
relief.
106(c)
refers
to
the
courts
making
determinations
of
an
issue,
which
is
much
narrower
language
than
the
language
of
claim
used
in
106(a)
and
(b).
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
because
the
code
itself
distinguishes
those
two
concepts
by
treating...
voiding,
having
a
separate
set
of
voidance
provisions
from
the
recovery
provision.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
regarding
postpetition
transfers
like
this
one.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
i
don't
think
that's
so.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
the
significant
provision
is
section
550,
and
the
fact
that
section
550
contains
a
trigger
word
allows
suits
to
void
transfers.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
550
embraces
a
variety
of
provisions
that
regard
a
voidance
of
different
kinds
of
transfers.
postpetition
transfers
like
what
we're
talking
about
here,
as
well
as
fraudulent
conveyances
and
preferential
transfers,
we
would
say
that
you
look
to
section
550.
and
that...
and
under
section
106(c),
550
is
brought
in
by
virtue
of
(c)(1).
but
you
must
also
look
to
(c)(2)
to
determine
what
sort
of
relief
is
authorized;
(c)(2)
in
effect
specifies
the
consequences
of
applying
(c)(1).
(c)(2)
says
that
when
a
provision
has
been
triggered,
the
court
in
that
circumstance
can
render
a
determination
of
the
issue
that
has
arisen
under
the
trigger
provision.
and
that
language
regarding
determination
of
an
issue,
especially
when
compared
to
106(a)
and
(b),
clearly
seemed
to
limit
relief
beyond
that
contemplated
in
106(a)
and
(b).
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
think
i
would
need
to
know
more
facts,
but
i
believe
that
yes,
because
that
would
be
the
situation,
essentially
in
whiting
pools,
where
there
was
seizure
and
restraint
of
tangible
property.
in
that
case
it
was
immediately
before
the
petition
was
filed.
that
is
exactly
what
106(c)
was
designed
to
do.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
then
i
do
not
think
that--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--cases
start
to
get
hard
when
you
talk
about
identifiable
funds.
i
think
in
general
it
is
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
arises
in
the
eleventh
amendment
context.
you
have
edelman
v.
jordan
on
the
one
hand,
and
ex
parte
young
on
the
other.
and
in
individual
cases
you
need
to
look
at
the
trustee's
claim
and
say,
what
is
he
or
she
really
seeking?
is
it
in
effect
retroactive
monetary
relief?
in
general,
though,
i
would
say
that
there
will
be
very
few
claims
that
would
entail
the
handing
over
of
money
that
will
be
permitted
under
section
106(c).
the
clearest
example
would
be
some
sort
of
specie
remedy
where
you
have
rare
coins
and
those
were
seized
in
a
whiting
pools
kind
of
situation.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
court
did
address
that
phrase
in
hoffman,
and
if
i'm
recalling
it
correctly,
said
that
that
indicates
that
106(c)
is
in
fact
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
it
suspends
the
defense
of...
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
whatever
relief
is
authorized
under
section
106(c),
but
you
still
need
to
look
at
the
language
following
that
phrase
to
determine
exactly
what
is
authorized.
and
the
other
indication,
besides
contrasting
(c)
with
(a)
and
(b),
that
reinforces
the
narrow
scope
of
the
relief
authorized
under
section
106(c)
is
that
(c)
does
contain
the
provision
subpart
(c)(2).
we
think
that
it
is
improper
as
the
sixth
circuit
suggested
here,
to
look
at
the
provisions
that
have
been
triggered
to
determine
what
kind
of
relief
is
authorized.
rather
you
have
to
go
on
to
(c)(2)
and
determine
it
by
reference
to
that
provision.
if,
as
the
sixth
circuit
was
suggesting
here,
and
as
the
trustee
argues,
you
simply
look
to
whatever
relief
is
authorized
in
the
trigger
provision,
then
subpart
(c)(2)
become
superfluous.
it
then
becomes
merely
a
restatement
of
subpart
(c)(1).
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history,
it
indicates
that
106(c)
was
added
primarily
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits,
and
that
conflict
had
to
do
with
the
availability
of
declaratory
relief
rather
than
monetary
relief.
the
floor
managers
of
the
legislation
referred
to
a
case
called
gwilliam
which
was
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
gwilliam
case
held
that
a
bankruptcy
court
could
determine
whether
a
tax
debt
was
dischargeable,
whether
or
not
the
irs
had
filed
a
claim
against
the
estate.
there
was
contrary
precedent
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
so
106(c)
essentially
codifies
the
holding
in
gwilliam
so
that
even
when
a
governmental
unit
has
not
filed
a
claim
against
the
estate
and
brought
itself
within
(a)
and
(b),
it
is
still
subject
to
declarations
by
the
court,
the
bankruptcy
court,
that
have
to
do
with
the
government's
rights
in
the
property
of
the
estate.
so
to
the
extent
that
gwilliam
is
codified,
congress...
the
legislative
history
suggests...
also
intended
to
allow
binding
determinations
on
matters
in
addition
to
tax
debts.
thus,
under
the
rationale
of
the
way
that
section
106(c)
operates
is
that
the
government
is
bound
by
discharges
in
bankruptcy.
if
you
look
through
the
code,
all
of
the
discharge
provisions
in
the
various
chapters
contain
a
trigger
word.
and
to
the
extent
that
a
government
debt
has
been
brought
into
the
estate
and
is
part
of
a
reorganization
plan
or
an
order
of
relief
or
whatever,
that
is
discharged,
and
the
government
is
bound
by
that
discharge
order.
thus,
section
106(c),
even
though
it
does
not
authorize
monetary
relief,
nonetheless
serves
a
very
important
function.
it
gives
the
court
a
broad
array
of
declaratory
types
of
powers.
and
it
also,
in
certain
circumstances,
allows
incidental
injunctive
relief
of
the
sort
that
was
upheld
in
whiting
pools.
i
mentioned
whiting
pools
a
moment
ago.
to
discuss
it
a
little
further,
it
involved
tangible
property
that
had
been
seized
prior
to
bankruptcy
filing.
the
seizure
was
effected
by
the
irs,
and
before
the
seized
tangible
property
was
sold,
the
trustee
sought
turnover
of
the
property
to
the
estate.
in
effect,
the
court
was
determining
in
that
case,
and
rather
than
employ
self-help
remedies
of
the
type
that
would
be
authorized
under
the
tax
code,
the
government
had
to
resort
to
the
bankruptcy
code
for
relief,
just
like
other
creditors.
the
important
distinction
between
whiting
pools
and
this
case
is
that
it
involved
tangible
property
rather
than
a
claim
for
monetary
relief.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it's
part
of...
it
stems
from
the
fact
that
106(c)
was
added
after
all
of
the
rest
of
the
code
had
been
drafted.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
may
well
be--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--nor
have
i.
and
it
may
well
be
that
it
is
a
product
of
haste
or
that
in
fact
there
are
a
fairly
lengthy
list
of
provisions
that
include
one
of
these
three
trigger
words.
i
think
there
are
something
like
111
in
the
code.
when
you
look
at
what
provisions
are
triggered,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
rigorous
logic
between
what
was
included
and
what
was
excluded.
and
again,
i
would
suggest
that
there
was...
to
the
extent
that
it
was
logical,
there
was
a
broader
kind
of
logic
going
on
that
congress
started
with
the
gwilliam
case
that
concerned
declaratory
relief
in
the
tax
area,
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
generalize
that
holding
so
that
declaratory
relief
was
available
in
other
areas
where
the
government
had
not
filed
a
claim
against
the
estate,
and
thereby
brought
itself
under
(a)
and
(b).
you
had
this
conflict
in
the
circuits
out
there
that
it
wanted
to
resolve.
and
while
it
was
at
it,
it
considered
what
sorts
of
kind
of
major
actors
in
the
code
would
cover
declaratory
relief
of
the
sort
that
it
had
in
mind.
i
think
the
only
other
thing
that
one
can
say
about
what
the
choice
of
the
trigger
words
was
is
that
the
selection
of
governmental
unit
as
a
trigger
word
is
significant
in
as
much
as
it
suggests
that
where
congress
used
the
term
governmental
unit
elsewhere
in
the
code,
it
wasn't
thinking
about
waiving
sovereign
immunity.
it
had
to
go
back
after
the
fact
and
add
it
as
a
trigger
word.
that
is
important
inasmuch
as,
you
know,
likewise
in
the
trigger
provisions
that
address
monetary
recovery,
there
too,
congress
was
not
thinking
about
sovereign
immunity.
and
that
is
another
reason
why
it
is
inappropriate
to
look
to
the
trigger
provisions
to
determine
what
kind
of
relief
is
authorized.
the
third
of
the
three
trigger
words,
entity,
i
would
suggest
brings
in
some
very
important
provisions
that
congress
would
rationally
have
wanted
to
subject
the
government
to,
such
as
the
substance
of
the
automatic
stay
provision,
as
well
as
a
code
provision
which
authorized
the
trustee
to
void
the
fixing
of
certain
statutory
liens
that
attach
after
a
bankruptcy
petition
has
been
filed.
that
provision
only
contains
the
trigger
word
entity
and
i
think
it
is
a
situation
where
congress
chose
entity
with
the
idea
of
having
particular
provisions
apply.
in
any
event,
it
is
hard
to
figure
out
the
logic
of
the
way
section
106(c)
is
drafted.
what
you
can
say
about
it
with
confidence
is
that
it
does
not
clearly
speak
to
the
issue
of
monetary
recovery.
and
inasmuch
as
it
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
congress
had
to
speak
clearly,
as
it
did
in
(a)
and
(b),
if
it
intended
to
subject
governmental
entities
to
monetary
relief
under
that
provision.
because
it
is
not
clear,
it
cannot
be
construed
in
the
manner
that
the
sixth
circuit
adopted.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
have
three
points
to
make,
and
i
can
make
them
briefly.
first,
in
terms
of
respondent's
arguments
on
the
facts,
they're
simply
beside
the
point.
if
sovereign
immunity
has
not
been
waived,
then
the
merits
are
irrelevant
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
did
not
raise
the
question
about
the
voidability
of
the
transfer.
second,
with
respect
to
the
in
rem
theory
of
jurisdiction
that
the
respondent
is
asserting
here,
whatever
its
merits,
it
simply
doesn't
apply.
we're
talking
about
money,
and
there
may
be
close
cases
where
money
is
arguably
erased,
but
this
is
not
one
of
them.
the
money
is--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--even
if
you
thought
that,
i
think
that
inasmuch
as
it
wasn't
raised
below,
i
doubt
that
the
court
should
entertain
it
at
this
point.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
judgment
below,
in
my
mind,
can't
be
defended
as
an
exercise
of
in
rem
jurisdictions.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
would
seem
like
for
it
to
be
an
in
rem
order,
it
would
have
to
order
the
government
to
turn
over
the
very
same
dollars
that
were
taken
out--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
again,
my
point
would
be
on
the
merits
of
the
argument.
i
just
don't
think
it
works,
certainly,
here.
and
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
that
as
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
no
in
rem
exception
to
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
the
u.s.
code
there
are
examples
of
instances
in
which
congress
has
felt
it
necessary
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
certain
exercises
of
in
rem
jurisdiction.
so
the
two
are
simply
inconsistent.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
there
is
an
answer.
it
does
not
make
the
except
as
phrase
perfectly
grammatical.
it
means
that
money
relief
against
governmental
units
is
not
available
except
as
provided
in
subsections
(a)
and
(b).
now,
while
that
is
not
grammatically...
the
point
was
not
grammatically
made,
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
what
it
means
is
that
this
same
construction
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
code.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
57a
of
our
appendix.
we
reprint
section
549
on
that
page.
and
549(a)
of
the
code
begins
in
the
same
way.
it
is
the
provision
regarding
postpetition
transfers.
and
549(a)
sets
forth
a
general
rule
for
voiding
postpetition
transfers.
it
begins
by
saying,
except
as
provided
in
subsections
(b)
or
(c).
(b)
or
(c)
create
exceptions
to
a
general
rule,
and
i
would
say
that
the
same
wording
does
the
same
thing
in
subsection
106(c).
thank
you.
