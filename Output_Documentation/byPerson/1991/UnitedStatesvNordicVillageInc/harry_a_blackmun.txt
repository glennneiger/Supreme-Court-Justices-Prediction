harry

mr.
seamon,
before
you
get
started,
don't
our
rules
provide
that
briefs
should
have
a
summary
of
the
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
solicitor
general's
office
subject
to
those
rules?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
is
the
summary
of
argument
in
your
brief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
say
that
again?
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
seamon,
the
lower
courts
found,
did
they
not,
that
the
irs
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
transfer's
voidability?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
what
did
they
base
that
finding?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
you
don't
mention
that
at
all
in
your
brief,
do
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
critical
of
the
lower
court's
finding,
and
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
you
haven't
mentioned
it
in
the
brief.
