first
this
morning
in
no.
91-594,
american
national
red
cross,
petitioner,
v.
s.
g.
and
a.
e..
mr.
englert.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
cite
department
of
employment
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
does,
as
in
the...
it
certainly
does,
as
a
matter
of
plausible,
logical
argument,
even
if
not
precedent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
further
justification
for
the
doctrine
on
its
merits,
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
state
decisis?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
englert.
mr.
mann,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
established
law,
mr.
mann,
that
if
someone...
if
in
a
corporation
is,
quote,
related,
close
quote,
to
the
federal
government
it's
not
subject
to
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
sounds
like
bootstrapping,
though,
to
say
we're
going
to
raise
an
issue
of
federal
law;
we
have
no
cases
to
support
it.
and
then
you
say
because
they're
going
to
raise
an
issue
of
federal
law
that
tends
to
support
federal
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
mr.
upton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
the
1925
statute,
mr.
upton,
fit
into
the
analytic
way
you
approach
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
upton.
mr.
englert,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
closest
case
in
this
court
on
the
jury
trial
issue?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-594,
american
national
red
cross
versus
s.g.
and
a.e.
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
