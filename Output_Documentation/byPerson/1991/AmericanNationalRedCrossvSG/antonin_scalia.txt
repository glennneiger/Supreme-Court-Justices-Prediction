justice
scalia
mr.
englert,
don't
you
think
language
in
osborn
is
really
quite
different?
i
mean,
there
it
refers
to
jurisdiction.
the
grant
was
the
right...
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
all
state
courts
having
competent
jurisdiction,
and
in
any
circuit
court
of
the
united
states.
it's
clear
that
the
congress
that
wrote
that
had
jurisdiction
in
mind.
justice
scalia
well,
what's
the
first
half
of
it
in
this
one?
justice
scalia
state
or
federal.
is
it
conferring
jurisdiction
over
state
courts
that
don't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
scalia
of
course
not.
so
it's
possible
to
think
in
this
grant,
that
jurisdiction
is
not
referred
to.
it
is
impossible
in
osborn
to
think
that
jurisdiction
is
not
referred
to.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
he
is
wrong.
justice
scalia
did
the
first
bank...
the
first
bank
of
the
united
states
provision
say
in
all
state
courts
having
competent
jurisdiction,
as
well?
justice
scalia
courts
of
record.
it
didn't
refer
to
jurisdiction
at
all.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
the
court
wasn't,
but
the
constitution
was.
i
mean,
it
really
does...
it
speaks
about
certain
categories
of
party-based
jurisdiction...
cases
affecting
ambassadors,
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
shall
be
a
party.
it
lists
a
bunch
of
party-based
bases
of
jurisdiction,
but
not
among
them
cases
to
which
any
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
shall
be
a
party.
justice
scalia
of
course,
if
they
use
the
language
that
they
used
in
d'oench,
duhme,
they
might
have
created
the
consequence
that
ensued
in
d'oench,
duhme,
which
would...
there
would
have
been
a
federal
common
law
governing
the
red
cross,
which
perhaps
they
did
not
want.
justice
scalia
but
in
d'oench,
duhme,
the
fact
remains
that
there
was
that
other
provision,
and
indeed
it
was...
it
was
cited
by
the
court
in
the
same
breath
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
corporation
brings
this
suit
under
an
act
of
congress
authorizing
it
to
sue
or
be
sued
in
any
court
of
law
or
equity,
state
or
federal.
justice
scalia
well,
the
best
way
you
could
do
it
in
the
same
breath
is
to
put
it
in
a
footnote.
[laughter]
the
whole
statement
in
d'oench,
duhme
is
just
a
casual
observation.
justice
scalia
well,
you've
read
justice
douglas'
opinions
before,
haven't
you?
[laughter]
