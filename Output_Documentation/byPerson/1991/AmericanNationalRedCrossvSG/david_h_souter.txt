justice
souter
what...
may
i...
excuse
me.
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
it
may
have
been
intended
to
answer
a
question
about
the
possibility
of
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
souter
well,
wasn't
that
true
in
d'oench?
justice
souter
this
court
didn't
rely
on
that
language,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
respondents
filed
a
state
law
tort
suit
in
a
new
hampshire
state
court
alleging
that
one
of
them
had
contracted
aids
from
a
transfusion
of
infected
blood
supplied
by
the
petitioner,
red
cross.
the
red
cross
removed
the
case
to
federal
district
court
citing
among
other
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
the
sue-and-be-sued
provision
of
its
federal
charter.
the
district
court
asserted
jurisdiction
on
that
basis.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
concluding
that
the
charter
provision
in
question
did
not
in
fact
confer
federal
jurisdiction
over
cases
to
which
the
red
cross
was
a
party.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
has
construed
similar
sue-and-be-sued
provision
since
the
early
19th
century.
when
read
together,
our
cases
support
a
rule
that
such
a
provision
may
be
read
to
confer
a
federal
jurisdiction
if
it
specifically
mentions
the
federal
courts,
though
a
particular
federal
court
need
not
be
mentioned
by
name.
as
the
relevant
provision
of
the
red
cross'
charter
satisfies
this
requirement,
we
hold
that
it
confers
federal
jurisdiction
over
cases
to
which
that
organization
is
a
party.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
o'connor,
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
