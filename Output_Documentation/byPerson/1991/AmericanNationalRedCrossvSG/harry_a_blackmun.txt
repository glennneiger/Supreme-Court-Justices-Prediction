justice
blackmun
in
other
words,
you're
not
asking
us
to
overrule
the
osborn
case?
justice
blackmun
we
seldom
overrule
chief
justice
marshall,
i
suppose.
justice
blackmun
i
suppose
it's
of
no
legal
consequence,
but
what
is
the
comparative
condition
of
the
court
calendars
in
federal
court
and
state
court
in
new
hampshire?
justice
blackmun
well,
if
you
stayed
on
the
state
side,
would
this
case
come
on
sooner
than
if
you
were
on
the
federal
side?
justice
blackmun
by
very
much?
justice
blackmun
by
very
much?
justice
blackmun
i
might
say
that's
not
true
everywhere.
justice
blackmun
mr.
upton,
do
you
think
the
bankers
trust
case,
which
involved
a
railroad,
and
applied
to
all
railroads
in
the
country,
really,
is
any
different
from
this
case
which
applies
to
one
corporation,
the
american
red
cross?
justice
blackmun
from
a
pragmatic
point
of
view,
i
suppose
the
court,
as
it
was
constructed
back...
looked
with
alarm
on
every
railroad
case
coming
into
federal
court.
justice
blackmun
so
you
think
there
are
cases
that
hang
on
this
one
then?
