justice
o'connor
mr.
englert,
do
you
plan
to
address
the
constitutional
concerns
that
were
raised
in
the
respondents'
brief,
and
tell
us
in
what
way
cases
arise
under
federal
law
within
the
meaning
of
article
3,
simply
because
the
red
cross
is
a
litigant?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
in
verlinden
and
more
recent
cases
this
court
has
been
wary
of
that
kind
of
a...
an
approach?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
law
is
going
to
apply
in
the
tort
suit,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
mr.
englert
had
indicated
a
concession
that
state
law
would
apply
to
this
suit.
justice
o'connor
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
now
arguing
that,
at
least
in
some
areas,
federal
law
is
applicable.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
closer
analogy
is
osborn,
where
the
court
held
that
a
similar
provision
didn't
violate
article
3.
i
mean,
that's
your
analogy.
