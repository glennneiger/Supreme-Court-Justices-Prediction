justice
kennedy
and
i
suppose
we
could
explain
the
result
in
osborn
by
saying
that
that
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
bank
was
an
instrumentality.
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
was
the
bank
of
the
united
states
not
an
instrumentality
in
another
sense?
in
other
words,
it
was
an
arm,
an
instrument,
an
instrumentality
in
the
united
states,
an
agency
of
the
united
states?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
mcculloch
v.
maryland
was
wrong.
justice
kennedy
does
the
red
cross
have
a
special
tax
exemption?
justice
kennedy
but
as
a
matter
of
our
jurisprudence
and
not
just
some
statutory...
expressed
statutory
provision?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
thought
the
international
charter
of
the
red
cross
made
it
rather
clear
that
a
national
organization
should
not
be
any
part
of
governmental
entity.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
quite
inconsistent
with
what
you're
saying
now.
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
general
principle
that
you're
arguing,
that
it
is
then
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
unlike,
say,
a
railroad
that
has
a
federal...
charter?
justice
kennedy
so
then
all
of
these
important
international
and
national
attributes
of
the
red
cross
are
really
quite
beside
the
point
so
far
as
your
standard
is
concerned?
justice
kennedy
so
your
legal
standard
is
the
proximity
of
relation
to
the
united
states
government
is
controlling?
