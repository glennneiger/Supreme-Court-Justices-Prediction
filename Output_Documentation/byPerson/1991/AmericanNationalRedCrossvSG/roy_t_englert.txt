mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
the
red
cross
charter
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
or,
instead,
merely
confers
on
the
red
cross
the
capacity
to
sue
and
be
sued.
the
clause
gives
the
red
cross,
quote,
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
courts
of
law
and
equity,
state
or
federal,
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
end
quote.
the
phrase
state
or
federal,
on
which
we
rely,
was
added
to
the
charter
in
1947.
from
1905
to
1947,
the
red
cross
had
the
same
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
courts
of
law
and
equity,
but
the
federal
courts
were
neither
excluded
from
nor
specified
in
that
grant
of
capacity.
there
is
no
possible
basis
to
doubt
that
the
red
cross
had
the
capacity
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
federal
court
between
1905
and
1947.
nevertheless,
the
first
circuit
construed
the
1947
amendment
as
merely
conferring
that
very
same
capacity.
that,
we
submit,
was
the
court's
first
error.
but
the
case
for
giving
a
jurisdictional
reading
to
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
rests
on
much
more
than
the
fact
that
the
first
circuit
construed
the
1947
amendment
to
be
meaningless.
it
rests
on
two
venerable
decisions
of
this
court:
osborn
v.
bank
of
the
united
states,
and
d'oench,
duhme
&
co.
v.
fdic.
the
osborn
decision,
written
by
chief
justice
marshall,
has
been
regarded
as
a
landmark
decision
of
this
court
for
168
years.
the
d'oench
decision,
now
50
years
old,
is
famous
in
its
own
right
in
the
banking
field.
and
it's
especially
important
because
it
was
decided
just
before
the
amendments
to
the
red
cross
charter
were
drafted.
the
court
in
osborn
construed
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
the
charter
of
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
the
court
thought
the
point
so
clear
that
it
said
that
the
words
could
not
be
made
plainer
by
explanation.
the
court
recognized
that
some
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
will
merely
confer
the
capacity
to
sue
and
not
jurisdiction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
agree
with
that;
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
red
cross
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
believe
not,
justice
kennedy.
the
bank
of
the
united
states
was
80...
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
was
80
percent
privately
owned.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
mcculloch
v.
maryland
was
right,
and
mcculloch
v.
maryland
was
applied
to
the
red
cross
in
the
department
of
employment
v.
united
states,
and
has
been
applied
to
army
post
exchanges...
to
other
similar
entities,
that
while
not
agencies
of
the
united
states
are
tax-immune
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
have
a
special
tax
exemption,
by
virtue
of
its
status
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
receives
special
tax
treatment
under
a
variety
of
statutes.
but
its
immunity
from
state
taxation
is...
was
held
by
this
court
to
exist
in
department
of
employment
v.
united
states,
by
a
line
of
cases
directly
descending
from
mcculloch
v.
maryland.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that
argument,
too,
was
made
to
this
court
in
the
department
of
employment
v.
united
states
case,
and
rejected...
and
has
been
rejected
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
subsequent
cases.
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
charter
of
the
international...
not
the
charter,
the
statutes
of
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
do
require
that
the
national
organizations
be
autonomous
from
their
federal
governments.
and
the
red
cross
does
have
sufficient
autonomy
to
comply
with
that
statute.
it
has
been
certified
as
being
in
compliance
with
that
statute.
at
the
same
time,
however,
it
partakes
sufficiently
of
governmental
status
that
it
is,
under
this
court's
decisions,
a
tax-immune
instrumentality.
it
was
referred
to
by
the
court
in
the
department
of
employment
as
virtually
an
arm
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
we
think
it's
equally
clear
that
the
congress
that
wrote
the
red
cross
charter
had
jurisdiction
in
mind.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
state
and
federal
courts
are
referred
to
in
parallel
fashion
in
the
red
cross
charter.
it
says
any
court
of
law
or
equity,
state
or
federal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
professor
wright
certainly
disagrees
with
that
proposition.
he
has
been
known
to--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--question
the
osborn
ruling.
well,
maybe
he
is
wrong.
[laughter]
in
any
event,
your
honor,
that
is
the
first
circuit's
reasoning.
and
the
court
might
have
read
the
charter
in
osborn
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
for
that
reason.
but
it
didn't.
it
read
the
charter
in
osborn
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
for
a
quite
different
reason.
it
said
the
difference
between
this
charter,
and
the
charter
of
the
first
bank
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
charter
of
the
first
bank
did
not
mention
the
courts
of
the
union.
and
because
this
charter
mentions
the
courts
of
the
union,
it
must
be
construed
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
it
referred
to
courts
of
record.
it
didn't--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
did
not
refer
to
jurisdiction
at
all.
but
again,
whatever
validity
that
argument
might
have
had
as
an
initial
matter,
that
that's
the
reason
why
the
charter
in
osborn
grants
jurisdiction,
is
not
the
reason
that
was
advanced
by
counsel,
or
by
chief
justice
marshall
for
the
court.
the
only
justice
who
cited
that
provision
in
osborn
was
justice
johnson
in
his
dissent.
it
played
no
role
in
this
court's
reasoning
in
osborn.
osborn
aside,
the
charter
in
d'oench,
duhme
&
co.
v.
fdic
is
exactly
like
the
red
cross
charter.
it
refers
to
any
court
of
competent...
a
court
of
law
or
equity,
state
or
federal,
in
exactly
parallel
fashion.
and
this
court
observed
in
d'oench,
duhme
that
that
clause
was
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
now,
that
was
just
5
years
before
the
red
cross
charter
was
amended.
and
the
congress
was
entitled
to
accept
this
court's
representation
in
d'oench
that
amending
a
charter
so
that
it
said
that
an
entity
may
sue
and
be
sued
in
any
court,
state
or
federal,
is
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
that
question
was
addressed
and
answered
for
the
first
time
in
osborn.
and
the
holding
of
osborn
in
that
respect
has
been
reiterated
through
the
years,
up
to
as
recently
as
the
verlinden
case
in
1983.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
this
court
has
been
wary
of
extending
that
kind
of
approach.
there's
no
question.
but
we're
not
asking
for
an
extension
of
that
kind
of
approach,
by
any
means.
what
the
court
said
in
osborn,
what
it
reiterated
in
bankers
trust,
what
it
reiterated
in
puerto
rico
v.
russell
&
co.,
what
it
reiterated
in
gully,
was
that
a
lawsuit
against
a
federally
chartered
entity,
necessarily
has
an
ingredient
of
federal
law
because
that
entity
has
no
powers,
save
those
granted
by
its
charter.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
state
law.
that
does
not
prevent
the
case
from
arising
under
federal
law
for
purposes
of--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
as
was
pointed
out
in
verlinden,
the
court
has
taken
two
divergent
paths
in
interpreting
arising
under,
under
the
statute
and
under
the
constitution.
the
court
has
construed
arising
under
very
narrowly,
under
section
1331.
it
has
construed
arising
under
very
broadly
under
the
constitution.
and
again,
it
has
been
established,
since
1824,
that
if
the
suit
is
against
a
federally
chartered
entity,
that
entity's
capacity
to
sue
and
be
sued
is
an
ingredient
of
the
action
that
gives
it
the
necessary
federal
element
to
satisfy
article
3.
and
again,
i
would
say
that
has...
that
aspect
of
osborn
has,
to
my
knowledge,
never
been
questioned.
it
is
not
the
aspect
that
justice
frankfurter
questioned
in
his
lincoln
mills
dissent.
it
is
not
the
aspect
that
is
questioned
in
hart
and
wechsler;
it
is
something
that,
to
the
contrary,
this
court
has
reaffirmed.
in
gully,
the
court
said
that
the
doctrine
of
the
charter
cases...
although
to
be
treated
as
exceptional...
is
not
being
questioned
within
its
own
realm.
we
do
not
think,
ultimately,
the
constitutional
question...
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions...
is
a
serious
one.
i
put
it
that
way
because
obviously
the
court
shies
away
from
serious
constitutional
questions
in
construing
statutes,
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
red
cross,
as
i
was
saying
in
response
to
some
of
justice
kennedy's
questions,
is
an
important
federal
instrumentality.
it
exists
for
the
purpose
of
fulfilling
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states.
it
was
chartered
in
1905
for
the
explicit
purpose
of
putting
it
under
government
supervision.
it
was
re-chartered
in
1947
for
the
explicit
purpose
of
recognizing
its
national
stature.
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
very
special
entity
that
logically
fits
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
if
congress
wishes
to
place
it
there...
which
is,
of
course,
what
we
submit
congress
has
done.
this
is
not
a
corner
grocery
store,
or...
to
take
an
example
from
this
court's
cases...
a
railroad
that
the
congress
has
chartered.
this
is
the
american
national
red
cross,
a
very
important
national
and
international
entity.
and
we
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
article
3
is
broad
enough
to
allow
the
federal
courts
to
give
party-base
jurisdiction.
if
i
might
return
to
this
court's
precedent...
notwithstanding
the
chief
justice's
question...
in
fslic
against
ticktin,
decided
3
years
ago,
the
court
explained
at
some
length
that
there
was
party...
party-based
jurisdiction...
that
was
the
court's
phrase...
over
the...
over
cases
brought
by
or
against
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
again,
the
court
was
not
troubled
by
the
idea
that
jurisdiction
could
depend
on
who
the
party
is
and
not
what
the
questions
raised
are...
which
is,
again,
what
we
submit
is
true
in
this
case.
now,
fslic,
like
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
and
that's
exactly
why
in
bank
of
the
united...
in
osborn
v.
bank
of
the
united
states,
chief
justice
marshall
examined
for
the
court
the
meaning
of
the
grant
of
arising
under
jurisdiction
in
the
constitution
and
not
one
of
those
other
grants
of
jurisdiction
in
article
3,
section
2,
and
held
that
it
was
within
the
jurisdiction,
within
the
constitutionally
granted
jurisdiction
that
congress
could
confer,
to
have
that
kind
of
party-based
jurisdiction
in
suits
by
and
against
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
if
the
court
thinks
it
necessary
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
red
cross
charter,
it
will
find
further
support
for
our
position
on
the
statutory
question.
the
reports
to
the
foreign
relations
and
foreign
affairs
committees
refer
the
reader
to
the
harriman
committee
report.
the
harriman
committee
report,
in
turn,
explains
the
reference
to
state
and
federal
courts
as
one
that
was
being
added,
quote,
in
view
of
the
limited
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
there
is
just
no
way
that
the
limited
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
can
have
anything
to
do
with
the
grant
of
capacity
to
sue.
the
language
of
the
harriman
committee
report
makes
sense
only
if
one
construes
the
charter
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
no
decision
of
this
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
serious
question
about
the
possibility
of
diversity
jurisdiction
at
any
time
since
1905.
the
difficulty
that
federally
chartered
entities
sometimes
encounter
in
invoking
diversity
jurisdiction
is
that,
because
they
are
not
citizens
of
any
state,
they
lack
a
basis
for
diversity
jurisdiction.
that's
no
true
of
the
red
cross.
in
the
1905
charter,
the
section
now
codified
at
36
u.s.c.
section
1,
and
again
in
the
1947
charter,
the
section
codified
at
36
u.s.c.
section
1a,
the
red
cross
is
stated
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
district
of
columbia.
in
light
of
that,
the
cases
that
say
federal
corporations
can't
sue
in
diversity
have
no
bearing
on
the
red
cross,
and
never
had
any
bearing
on
the
red
cross.
even
if
one
were
to
suppose
that
something
in
the
charter
had
res
diversity
jurisdiction,
it
would
surely
be
sections
1
and
1a,
no
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
section
2.
the
first
circuit
relied
heavily
on
this
court's
1916
decision
in
the
bankers
trust
case.
but
in
our
view,
it
simply
got
that
decision
wrong.
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
at
issue
in
that
case
made
no
reference
to
the
federal
courts.
and
it
was
not
a
serious
candidate
to
be
construed
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
the
court,
quite
naturally,
said
that
congres
would
have
used
altogether
different
words
had
it
wished
to
confer
jurisdiction.
congress
did
use
altogether
different
words
in
the
red
cross
charter.
and
the
bankers
trust
case
doesn't
stand
for
anything
more
sweeping
than
that.
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
make
clear
what
i
meant
to
say
before.
state
law
governs
the
tort
issues
in
this
case.
that
does
not
mean
that
we
don't
have
federal
defenses.
there
are
federal
issues
about
jury
trial
and
punitive
damages.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
red
cross
shares
the
federal
government's
immunity
from
jury
trial
and
punitive
damages.
the
one
court
that
has
addressed
the
punitive
damages
issue
has
so
held.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
lehman
v.
nakshian.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
lehman
v.
nakshian.
the
reason
i...
one
reason
i
didn't
mention
those
before
is
that
under
osborn,
they
are
not
necessary.
the
federal
chartering
of
the
red
cross
is
sufficient.
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
cut
back
on
osborn...
notwithstanding
its
authorship...
that
the
other
factors
that
have
been
mentioned
today
would
be
relevant,
perhaps...
the
fact
that
the
red
cross
does
have
federal
defenses,
the
fact
that
the
red
cross
is
a
very
important
instrumentality
that
carries
out
treaty
obligations
in
the
united
states.
but
it's
only
if
osborn
is
overruled
or
cut
back
on
that
the
constitutional
question
can,
in
any
way,
be
deemed
serious.
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
respondents
are
asking
this
court
to
overrule
osborn's
constitutional
holding.
they
say,
on
page
32
of
their
brief,
this
court
must
reach
the
issue
of
whether
osborn's
broad
interpretation
of
article
3
remains
good
law.
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
in
the
d'oench
case,
in
which
the
charter
language
was
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
the
language
put
into
the
red
cross
charter
5
years
later--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
we
are
not
saying
that
at
all,
justice
stevens.
because
the
effect
of
that
additional
arising-under
clause,
in
d'oench,
the
clause
cited
in
the
footnote
is,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
to
require
the
development
of
a
federal
law
that
will
govern
all
these
cases.
and
we
are
not
asking
for
that.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
this
is
party-based
jurisdiction,
we're
talking
about.
now,
for
purposes
of
article
3,
yes.
we
are
saying
that
the
relevant
clause
of
article
3
is
the
arising-under
clause.
but
that
should
not
be
confused
with
saying
that
this
is
a
section
1331
case.
it
is
not.
section
1331
does
not
apply
here.
only
in
the
constitutional
sense
are
we
asking
this
court
to
hold...
as
it
held
in
osborn,
and
has
reaffirmed
since...
that
cases
like
this
arise
under
federal
law,
that
it
is
party-based
jurisdiction
that
depends
on
the
status
of
the
party
as
a
federally
chartered
entity,
and
if
the
court
thinks
it
relevant,
a
very
important
federal
instrumentality
that
will
be
raising
federal
defenses.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i
could
quarrel
with
the
same
breath,
since
it's
in
a
footnote.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it's
more
than
a
casual
observation.
i'm
not
familiar
with
this
court
making
many
casual
observations.
the
question
in
that
case
was
what--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
question
was
what
law
to
apply,
and
one
of
the
factors
bearing
on
what
law
to
apply
was
what
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
was,
whether
it
was
diversity
or
something
else.
the
court
said
pointedly,
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
here
is
not
diversity.
it's
something
else.
it's
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
and
in
a
footnote,
whether
or
not
in
the
same
breath,
it
said
the
clause...
the
statute
further
provides
something
else.
that
clause
actually
was
omitted
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
curiously
enough,
in
that
case.
the
solicitor
general
certainly
thought
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
was
adequate.
and
our
whole
point
is
that
congress
is
entitled
to
make
the
same
assumption
that
the
solicitor
general
of
this
court
made
in
1942,
that
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
with
the
words
state
or
federal,
is
adequate
to
confer
federal
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
