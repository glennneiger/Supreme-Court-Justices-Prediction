mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
would
state
the
issue
in
this
case
a
little
differently
from
the
petitioner.
we
believe
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
federal
jurisdiction
over
ordinary
tort
actions
with
no
federal
issue
and
no
limit
on
the
amount
in
controversy
should
be
implied
from
doubtful
and
ambiguous
language
in
the
red
cross
charter.
now,
red
cross
claims
that
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
its
charter
is
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
are
generally
construed
as
simply
a
grant
of
capacity
to
litigate.
they
ordinarily
appear
in
corporate
charters,
whether
they
be
federal
or
not.
they're
not
usually
construed
to
be
anything
other
than
the
capacity
to
litigate,
unless
there
is
some
very
clear
and
specific
language.
we
would
say
that
they...
the
courts
have
construed
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
as
grants
of
federal...
of
court
jurisdiction,
but
usually
it's
only
when
there's
very
specific
and
clear
language,
and
usually
there's
a
reference
to
particular
courts.
there's
got
to
be
some
way
that
you
distinguish
the
language
which
relates
to
capacity
to
litigate
to
the
language
which
is
a
conferral
of
jurisdiction,
especially
if
it's
all
mingled
into
one
sentence,
as
this
is.
and
that's
why
the
courts
have
ordinarily
required
some
very
specific
language
referring
to
particular
courts.
there
are
a
couple
cases
this
court
has
considered.
the
first
one
was
the
deveaux
case
in
1809,
and
later
the
bankers
trust
case
in
1916.
the
language
is
very
general
in
those
two
cases,
and
this
court
ruled
in
each
of
them
the
language
was
not
specific
enough
to
be
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
of
osborn
v.
the
bank
of
the
united
states,
which
was
handed
down
in
1824,
there
was...
this
court
did
rule
that
there
was
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction
there.
and
this
is
the
case
that
the
red
cross
relies
primarily
on.
but
we
would
suggest
that
the
language
in
the
osborn
case,
especially
the
bank
charter,
is
quite
distinguishable
from
the
red
cross
charter.
the
bank
of
the
united
states,
the
second--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--i
don't
think
it's
necessary
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think
the
charters...
the
language
in
the
two
charters
are
quite
different.
the
red
cross
is
seeking
to
extend
the
holding
in
osborn.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
should
be
done.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
think
that
if
it's
limited
to
the
language
that's
there,
it's
a
good
decision...
at
least
on
that
point.
what
was
provided
in
that
second
bank
charter
was
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
all
state
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
in
any
circuit
court
of
the
united
states.
as
i
suggested...
as
i've
said,
we
think
those
charters
are
markedly
different.
the
red
cross
charter
simply
provides
sue
and
be
sued
in
courts
of
law
and
equity,
state
or
federal,
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
the
red
cross
charter
is
general
and
unspecific.
the
bank
charter
is
quite
specific,
and
uses
the
language
of
jurisdiction.
the
bank
charter,
in
our
view,
is
carefully
drafted.
it
allows
each
state
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
its
own
courts.
and
there
is
a
recognition
and
there's
deference
paid
to
the
state
court
system
of
each
state...
state
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction.
however,
as
to
federal
jurisdiction,
it
designates
the
circuit
courts
of
the
united
states
which,
at
that
time,
were
the
federal
courts
of
original
jurisdiction.
so
this
is
quite
a
specific
and
carefully
drafted
charter.
and
as
i've
said,
i
think
if
it's
confined
to
the
language
in
that
charter,
it's
a
good
decision.
it
shouldn't
be
expanded,
as
the
red
cross
suggests,
because
i
think
it
will
make
that
decision
almost
meaningless.
the
red
cross
charter
uses
the
words
state
or
federal.
and
i
would
suggest
that
those
two
words
are
so
general,
they
encompass
the
entire
judicial
system
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
sure.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
because...
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--yes,
i
think
that...
that
part
of
it
is
true.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
think
that
there
still
was
a
question
on
diversity
jurisdiction,
because
although
this
corporation
was
a
citizen
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
tidewater
decision
didn't
come
down
until
1949.
and
that
was
when
it
was
ruled
that
a
grant
of
jurisdiction...
or
put
it
this
way...
that
if
a
corporation
is
domiciled
in
the
district
of
columbia,
then
it
was
a
citizen
of
a
particular
state,
even
though
it
wasn't
a
state.
that's
what
they
ruled
in
tidewater.
but
that
wasn't
handed
down--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--until
after--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it,
that
statute
was
enacted
in
1940,
the
district
of
columbia
statute,
and
it
wasn't
approved
by
this
court
until
1949.
so
i
think
there
was
still
was
a
question
there
to
be
clarified.
and
i
think
red
cross
is
playing
it
safe.
going
on,
i
would
say
that
in
the
red
cross
charter,
there's
no
concern
there
as
to
which
states
have...
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
the
red
cross.
and
as
to
federal
courts,
the
language
is
so
general,
it
opens
up
the
entire
federal
system
to
the
red
cross,
at
any
level.
i
would
suggest
that
the
word
federal
has
no
special
or
technical
meaning
which
would
give
the
red
cross
access
to
the
united
states
district
courts.
there--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--d'oench
is
a
case
which
can
be
distinguished.
because
in
d'oench,
there
is
language
very
similar
to
the
red
cross
charter,
but
further
on
in
the
same
charter
is
language
that
says
all
cases
against
the
corporation
shall
be
deemed
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
so
it's
quite
a
different
situation
there.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
it's
not
clear
what...
the
case
was
not
even
litigated
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
relied
on
the
language
in
the
footnote
or
the
language
in
the
decision
as
far
as
federal
jurisdiction
because
that
really
wasn't
litigated
in
the
case.
the
real
point
at
issue
in
that
case
was
which
law
governed
and
whether
it
was...
and
there
was
a
suit
on
the
enforcement
of
a
note...
suit
for
the
enforcement
of
a
note.
and
as
i
recall
it,
the
state
law
of
illinois
or
missouri
or
the
federal
law
was
to
control.
and
the
court
finally
determined
the
federal
law
was
controlling.
and
the
jurisdictional
issue
as
to
whether
federal
court
was...
this
court
and
lower
courts
had
jurisdiction
over
the
d'oench
case
was
never
actually
litigated.
the
parties
all
conceded
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction.
and
that's
what
the
circuit
court
observed,
too.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
well,
i
understand
from
my
limited
conversations
with
the
federal
judges,
that
they're
just
as
busy
as
they
can
be.
we
keep
adding
another
judge,
from
time
to
time.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i
can't
honestly
say
that's
true.
i
think
the
usual
timeframe
is
a
year
and
a
half
to
2
years
in
merrimack
county
superior
court.
and
in
federal
court...
i'm
sorry...
in
federal
court,
brother
richardson
advises
me,
it's
usually
3
to
4
years.
so
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i'm
sure
that's
true.
well,
i
was
saying,
the
word
federal
to
me
has
no
special
or
technical
meaning
that
should
open
up
the
federal
courts
to
the
red
cross.
it's
too
general.
i'd
also
observe
that
state
and
federal
courts
are
treated
with
equal
generality,
and
there's
no
concern
in
the
drafting
of
that
red
cross
charter
for
the
peculiarities
of
the
state
system
and
the
federal
system.
one
is
a
state
of
general...
has
courts
of
general
jurisdiction;
the
other
has
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask,
when
federal
jurisdiction
is
going
to
be
conferred,
that
it
be
done
in
a
specific
way,
and
done
clearly.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
well,
let
me
say
this.
i
find
the
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
concerning
this
matter
extremely
ambiguous
and
confusing.
i'm
not
sure
what
congress
was
talking
about.
and
the
only
way
i
can
unravel
any
meaning
out
of
it
is
to
say
i
think
they're
talking
about
diversity
jurisdiction
here.
of
course,
one
thing...
there've
been
some
developments
over
the
years
which
pertain
to
this
situation.
and
that
is,
the
red
cross
is
a
federal
corporation.
and
in
1916,
in
the
bankers
trust
case,
this
court
ruled
that
a
federal
corporation...
in
this
case
the
railroad...
was
doing
business
in
no
particular
state,
but
many
states.
so
it
had
no
base.
and
that
may
have
had
some
pertinence
to
the
situation.
and
in
1925,
as
has
been
observed,
the
predecessor
statute
to
1349
was
passed,
which
precluded
federal
corporations
from
invoking
federal
jurisdiction,
unless
they
were
owned
or
controlled
by
the
united
states.
now,
those
developments
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
passage
of
this
amendment
in
1947.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
that
would
have
been--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--much
better.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
that
could
well
have
been
done.
my
feeling
is
that
the...
and
the
first
circuit,
too...
is
that
this
amendment
was
very
poorly
drafted.
it
should
have
been
more
specific
as
to
exactly
what
they
were
driving
at.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
in
the
principle--
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
--well,
there
could
be
some
alarm
with
whether
or
not
other
federal
corporations
with
similar
charters
may
attempt
to
invoke
federal
jurisdiction,
if
this
case
is...
if
we
construe
this
charter
as
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i
think
there
are
other
federal
corporations...
i
can
cite
three...
which
have
very
similar
charters.
neighborhood...
excuse
me...
neighborhood
reinvestment
corporation
has
a
very
similar
charter;
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
has
a
very
similar
charter;
and
securities
investor
protection
corporation
has
almost
an
identical
charter...
and
all
three
of
these
corporations,
sooner
or
later,
will
be
seeking
federal
jurisdiction
if
this
case
is
decided
in
the
favor
of
red
cross.
as
i
stated,
the
way
this
is
drafted,
there's
no
concern
for
the
peculiarities
of
each...
court
system,
the
state
and
the
federal,
one
being...
one
having
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
the
others
having...
the
other
having
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
and
therefore,
i
think
it's
sound
to
construe
this
statute
not
as
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
but
as
a
grant
of
capacity
to
litigate.
there's
not
enough
specificity
in
it.
and
it
resembles
strongly
the
charter
in
the
bankers
trust
case,
which
this
court
ruled
was
a...
simply
a
grant
of
capacity
to
litigate.
now
in
1925,
congress,
at
the
urging
of
three
justices
of
this
court,
legislatively
overruled
the
osborn
case,
insofar
as
it
pertained
to
federal
corporations.
at
that
time,
it
precluded
federal
corporations
from
access
to
federal
courts
unless
they
were
owned
or
controlled
by
the
united
states.
now,
that
was
a
very
strong,
and
definite
policy,
which
has
been
followed
by
this
court
over
the
last
50
years.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
congress
wants
to
make
an
exception,
as
it
has
with
certain
federal
corporations,
it
would
have
done
so
by
very
clear
and
specific
language...
such
as
the
fdic
charter,
and
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
those
charters
are
very
specific,
and
i
suggest
if
they
were
going
to
do
so
in
this
case,
they
would
have
used
very
specific
language
to
create
an
exception
to
that
general
policy.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
i
think
that
that
statute
requires
clear
and
specific
language,
in
the
same
way
that
if
you're
going
to
create
the
exception
to
the
usual
rule
in
construing
sue
and
be
sued
clauses,
you'd
want
clear
and
specific
language.
if
you're
going
to
create
an
exception
to
that
1925
policy,
you
would
do
so
by
clear
and
specific
language,
in
my
view.
and
that
has
been
done
in
many
of
the
cases...
in
many
of
the
federal
corporations.
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
i...
however,
i...
i'm
getting
to
the
d'oench
case,
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
that
for
a
moment.
and
i
think
the
d'oench
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
the
red
cross
case,
and,
in
fact,
supports
our
position
more
than
it
does
the
red
cross
position.
to
be
sure,
there's
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
which
is
very
similar...
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
courts
of
law
and
equity,
state
or
federal...
very
similar.
but
just
below
that,
in
the
same
charter,
it
says
that
all
civil
actions
against
the
corporation
shall
be
deemed
to
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
that's
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
and
congress
so
stated
in
1935,
when
it
amended
the
charter.
in
its
report,
it
indicated,
in
1935,
when
it
adopted
the
deemed
to
arise
language,
that
the
purpose
was
to
grant
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
why
was
that
later
amendment
required,
if
the
earlier
sue
and
be
sued
clause
was
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction?
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendment,
the
addition
of
the
language
state
or
federal,
is
both
ambiguous
and
confused.
courts
have
read
that
recommendation
22...
number
22.
some
have
said
oh,
all
they're
trying
to
do
is
clarify
capacity
to
litigate
in
federal
court
where
it
otherwise
exist.
other
courts...
half
of
the
courts
below...
have
said
no,
that's
a
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
i
think
that's
an
indication
right
there
that
this
is
a
very
ambiguous
piece
of
work.
i
would
also
point
out
for
the
court
there
is
language
in
recommendation
number
22
which
seems
more
consistent
with
a
grant
of
capacity
to
sue.
they
say
we
should
clarify
the
capacity
to
litigate
in
federal
court.
they
use
the
word
clarify,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
make
it
clear
that
the
red
cross
can
sue
in
federal
court.
and
then
further
on
they
refer
to
power
to
sue.
these...
this
is
language
of
capacity
to
litigate
rather
than
jurisdiction.
and
like
everything
else
relating
to
this
ill-starred
amendment,
it's
ambiguous.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
senate
hearing
on
this
amendment
was
quite
confused.
senator
george
says,
at
one
point,
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
is
to
give
the
jurisdiction
to
the
state
and
federal
courts.
and
then
a
few
pages
later
he
says,
we're
going
to
give
the
red
cross
the
power
to
be
sued
in
state
courts.
that,
i
think,
is
the
real
purpose
of
this
amendment.
so,
we
don't
really
know
what
senator
george
was
driving
at.
you
can't
reconcile
those
two
statements.
it's
also
significant
that
the
house
and
senate
reports
don't
even
refer
to
the
jurisdictional
point
at
all.
in
conclusion...
i'm
sorry...
i
would
just
make
one
other
point,
and
that's
on
the
constitutional
issue.
that
has
been
discussed
here,
and
we
did
mention
it
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
this
case
here
is
very
similar
to
the
case
of
mesa
v.
california.
in
mesa,
you
had
a
federal
officer
who
was
sued
in
state
court
and
attempted
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court.
this
court
ruled
that
that
was
a
pure...
that
1441...
1442(a)(1)
was
a
pure
jurisdictional
statute,
that
the
officer
tried
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court
under.
and...
but
they
did
infer
into
the
statute
a
requirement
that
the
federal
defense
had
to
be
alleged.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that
case,
which
dealt
with
a
federal
officer,
is
analogous
to
this
case,
where
we
have
a
federal
corporation.
they're
both
federal
entities
of
one
kind
or
another.
and
why
shouldn't
the
same
law
apply
to
one
that
applies
to
the
other?
mr.
j.
gilbert
upton
in
a
sense,
but
i
wonder
if
the
law
of
osborn
is
still
good
law
today
on
that
point,
since
it's
been
overruled
legislatively
already.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
constitutional
interpretation
is
wrong.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
the...
maybe
that
law
pertaining
to
federal
corporations
is
no
longer
viable
law,
as
justice
frankfurter
said
at
one
point,
in
one
of
his
opinions...
i
think
in
the
tidewater
case.
finally,
i
would
just
observe,
as
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
has
said,
nothing
is
so
wasteful
as
litigation
over
where
to
litigate.
we
have
been
litigating
this
case
now
for
the
last
2
years,
and
we've
done
little
else
but
talk
about
jurisdiction.
and
i'm
sure
that
both
the
red
cross
and
the
respondents
will
be
happy
when
this
vexing
issue
is
laid
to
rest.
thank
you
very
much.
