justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
you're
saying
there's
almost
a
federal
issue
in
every
case
that
they're
a
party
to
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to
win
this
case.
you
can
get
in
federal
court
on
federal
question
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
well,
one
of
the
first
questions
is
whether
we
should
adopt
a
construction
of
the
statute
that
makes
it
entirely
unnecessary
to
even
consider
the
constitutional
problem.
maybe
you're
dead
right
on
it.
but
generally,
we
try
to
avoid...
construe
statutes
so
we
don't
have
to
express
a
judgment
on
a
constitutional
question.
justice
stevens
there's
just
not
a
substantial
question.
justice
stevens
how
do
you
explain
the
statement
of
mr.
spofford
that
the
only
amendment
of
section
2
is
to
make
it
clear
that
suits
can
be
maintained
in
federal
as
well
as
states'
courts,
which
has
not
been
clear?
justice
stevens
you
can
answer
that
question,
i
think.
justice
stevens
no,
that
came
up
later.
but
this
came...
this
came
before
all
that
colloquy.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may--
justice
stevens
--why
did
they
have
to
add
the
word
federal?
because
there
can't
have
been...
and
wasn't
it
true
that
before
the
amendment
the
american
red
cross
was
a...
specifically
designated
as
a
citizen
of
the
district,
so
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
its
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
your
opponent
told
us
it
was
true.
i
guess
one
of
you
has
to
be--
justice
stevens
--and
before
that...
what
you're
saying
is
that--
justice
stevens
--time
it
was
not
clear
that
a
corp...
a
corporation
domiciled
in
the
district
was
a
citizen
of
the
state
for
diversity
purposes.
justice
stevens
mr.
upton,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
your
reliance--
justice
stevens
--on
tidewater.
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying
is
that
although
the
statute
had
given...
had
made
a
citizen
of
the
district,
a
citizen
of
the
state,
there
was
some
doubt
about
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
the
same
constitutional
doubt
apply
to
the
amendment
to
the
red
cross
charter,
if
it
related
only
to
diversity
jurisdiction?
if
that
was
the
doubt,
and
if
they're
trying
to
be
sure
about
the
question,
wouldn't
they
have...
doesn't
it
mean
that
they
must
have
been
intending
to
confer
federal
question
jurisdiction?
because
it
seems
to
me
if
the
constitutional
doubt
applied
to
the
existing
federal
statute,
it
would
equally
apply
to
the
amendment
to
the
red
cross
charter.
justice
stevens
of
course
a
simpler
way,
if
they
wanted
just
to
be
sure,
and
avoid
any
question
on
diversity
jurisdiction
was
to
make
the
corporation
a
citizen
of
maryland
rather
than
the
district.
justice
stevens
which
would...
that
would
have
made
it
perfectly
clear--
justice
stevens
--that
that's
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
give
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
what
about
the
fact
that
that's...
that
charter
said,
in
so
many
words,
any
case
to
which
the
federal
entity
as
a
party
shall
be
deemed
to
arise
under
federal
law...
you
are,
in
effect,
saying
that
we
should
treat
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
as
though
it
incorporated
a
similar
sentence
implicitly.
justice
stevens
well,
you
aren't
asking
for
development
of
federal
law.
but
you
are
asking
us
to
hold
it
is
to
be
deemed
to
present
a
federal
question,
aren't
you?
