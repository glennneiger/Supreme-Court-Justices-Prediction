mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
start
by
addressing
the
constitutional
question
which
seems
to
have
troubled
some
of
the
justices.
we
agree
entirely
with
the
red
cross,
that
article
3
of
the
constitution
permits
congress
to
extend
jurisdiction
to
cases
of
which
the
red
cross
is
a
party.
in
article
3
section
2
there
are
two
clauses
of
the
constitution
that
are
relevant
to
cases
of
this
sort.
one
clause
that
says
that
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
all
cases
arising
under
this
constitution,
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
treaties
made
under
their
authority;
the
second
clause
says
that
the
jurisdiction...
the
judicial
power
shall
extent
to
controversies
to
which
the
united
states
shall
be
a
party.
in
our
view,
this
case
involves
a
sufficient
federal
issue
that...
it
arises
under
federal
law,
not
just
because
this
court
has
said
clearly
in
the
past
that
it
does,
but
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
sound
constitutional
interpretation.
first,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
particular
case,
the
red
cross
is
likely
to
raise
issues
of
federal
law
in
defense
to
the
lawsuit.
we
understand
the
red
cross
will
contend
that
it
is
not
subject
to
punitive
damages
because
of
its
relation
to
the
federal
government,
and
also
that
it,
in
some
cases,
has
resisted
demands
for
jury
trials
because
of
its
relation
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no,
it
is
not
established
federal
law,
but
it
is
an
issue
of
federal
law
that
the
red
cross
plans
to
raise
in
this
particular
case.
we
express
no
view
on
the
merits
of
it.
but
i'm
pointing
out
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question.
there
are
cases
to
support
that
argument.
there
do
not
appear
to
be
any
cases
squarely
on
point
applying
those
types
of
immunities
to
the
red
cross.
the
red
cross...
the
second
reason
why
this
case
falls--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
believe
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
that
mr.
englert's
concession
was
that
state
law
will
apply
to
the
substantive
determination
of
whether
the
red
cross
was
liable
as
a
matter
of
negligence
or
under
some
other
state
tort
theory.
they
do
plan
to
introduce
federal
defenses.
but
that's
not
the
real,
main
point.
the
main
point
is
that
this
case
would
arise
under
federal
law
for
purposes
of
article
3,
without
regard
to
any
particular
issue
raised
in
the
case.
and
that's
the
point
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
made,
and
that's
what
i
would
like
to
address.
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
red
cross
is
powerfully
affected
with
the
federal
interest.
the
united
states
has
entered
into
quite
a
number
of
treaties
requiring
it
to
maintain
an
institution
such
as
the
red
cross.
the
red
cross
is
the
entity
that
performs
the
united
states'
obligations
under
various
geneva
conventions.
in
fact,
the
charter
provides
that
if
the
united
states
subsequently
enters
into
treaties,
the
red
cross
will
do
this.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
in
our
view,
it's
also
well
established
that
a
railroad
chartered
by
congress
would...
cases
to
which
a
railroad
was
a
party,
would
arise
under
federal
law.
that
was
decided
in
the
pacific
railroad
removal
cases,
and
this
court
has
repeated--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
they're
beside
the
point
under
this
court's
precedent.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
address
is,
to
the
extent
that
people
are
concerned
that
those
precedents
may
go
too
far,
and
it
is
suggested
that
congress
could
extent
the
judicial
power
to
cases
that
would
be
improper,
this
case
does
not
present
a
serious
problem
under
that.
it
does
not
raise
that
concern
because
the
red
cross
is
so
closely
related
to
the
united
states
government
that
it's
clear
that
congress
could
extend
it
to
the
red
cross.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
believe
that
it
would...
if
this
court
wished
to
cut
back
on
the
constitutional
rule
that
it
has
articulated
in
the
pacific
railroad
removal
cases,
it
would
be
unlikely
that
it
would
do
so
to
an
extent
that
would
deprive
entities
that
are
as
closely
related
to
the
federal
government
as
the
red
cross,
and
perform
statutory
and
treaty-mandated
function
as
important
as
those
that
are
performed
by
the
red
cross.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
lending
principle
that
would
allow
this
court
not
to
have
to
face
a
significant
constitutional
question
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
court's
decision
in
osborn
v.
bank
of
the
united
states
specifically
acknowledged
that...
a
number
of
limits
on
the
rule
that
are
articulated.
it
did
no
say
that
congress
could
merely
throw
a
cloak
over
a
state
corporation
and
thereby
bring
the
corporation
into
federal
court.
it
pointed
out
there,
as
in
this
case,
that
congress
didn't
just
make
this
entity
a
federal
corporation
just
to
get
it
into
federal
court.
congress
created
the
bank
of
the
united
states
to
serve
important
federal
purposes.
congress
gave
the
bank
of
the
united
states
all
of
its
powers,
capacities,
authorities,
and
imposed
obligations
under
it...
on
it...
under
federal
law.
congress
has
done
just
the
same
with
the
red
cross.
congress
created
the
red
cross
to
perform
important
federal
purposes.
those
purposes
are
the
very
reason
for
the
red
cross'
being.
accordingly,
the
ability
of
the
red
cross
to
incur
any
obligations
necessarily
raises
some
ingredient
of
federal
law
in
each
and
every
case
to
which
it's
a
party.
and
we
believe
that
that
analysis
makes
the
constitutional
question
much
less
serious
here.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no,
that's
not
entirely
accurate,
justice
stevens,
because
to
get
in
under
federal
question
jurisdiction
you
have
to
come
in
under
section
1331
of
title
28.
and
as
you
know
from
the
opinion
in
merrill
dow
there's
a
variety
of
rules
that
this
court
has
articulated
to
limit
the
statutory,
arising-under
jurisdiction
to
a
much
narrower
field
of
play
than
the
constitutional
arising-under
jurisdiction...
even
though
both
clauses
have
the
same
meaning.
this
case,
for
example,
would
no
satisfy
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
this
court
has
articulated
as
a
limitation
on
section
1331.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
quite
a
different
thing
to
say
that
congres
could
not
constitutionally
extend
the
jurisdiction
to
cases
involving
the
red
cross.
and
so
there
are
quite
a
number
of
cases
involving
the
red
cross
to
which
section
1331
would
not
extend.
i...
the
issue
in
this
case
in
substance
and
effect
is
whether
or
not
those
cases
can
be
brought
into
federal
court
under
the
separate
grant
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
that's
entirely
accurate.
that's
my
point,
as
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--in
this
case.
if
the
issue
in
this
case
were
a
neighborhood
grocery
store
in
the
district
of
columbia
that,
for
some
patronage
reason,
congress
cloaked
with
a
federal
charter
simply
to
get
it
into
federal
court,
and
it
had
no
significant
relation
to
the
federal
government,
and
for
which
there
was
no
reason
for
its
having
a
federal
charter
except
to
get
into
federal
court,
i
think
this
court
might
step
back
and
say
well,
we've
said
that
any
federal
charter
will
satisfy
but
that
one
does
not.
and,
in
fact,
the
analysis
in
osborn
suggests
such
a
limitation.
the
last
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
point
is
the
criticisms
to
which
justice
o'connor
refers
are,
for
the
most
part,
directed
at
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
statutory
jurisdiction.
it
is
true
that
this
court
repeatedly
has
criticized
the
notion
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
extend
with
the
general
federal
question
statute
all
of
the
permissible
jurisdiction
permitted
by
article
3
to
the
courts.
and
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
and
the
court
in
the
romero
case,
rightly,
suggested
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
believe
that
congress,
in
a
general
statute,
intended
to
commit
every
single
piece
of
jurisdiction
that
the
arising-under
clause
permits.
but
that
criticism
is
not
directed
at
the
notion
that
congress
constitutionally
could
take
an
entity
that
is
an
arm
of
the
united
states...
to
use
this
court's
phrase...
and
create
federal
jurisdiction
over
cases
to
which
it
is
a
party.
if
i
could
just,
in
brief,
in
closing...
the
real
gist
of
our
argument
on
the
merits
is
that
the
1947
statute
was
enacted
in
an
historical
context.
congress
created
the
red
cross
in
1905.
they
clearly,
at
that
time,
gave
jurisdiction
over
cases
to
which
it
was
a
party.
they
also
clearly
gave
it
capacity.
when
congress,
in
1925,
passed
the
general
statute
that
is
now
section
1349,
it
took
away
jurisdiction
over
cases
to
which
the
red
cross
was
a
party.
it
did
nothing
to
alter
capacity.
there
is
not
a
suggestion
in
the
materials
that
the
red
cross
did
not
have
the
capacity
to
sue
in
federal
courts
in
the
period
just
before
the
1947
charter
amendment
statute.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--my
understanding
of
the
context
of
the
discussion
in
the
hearings
is
that
the
discussion
in
that
case...
the
discussion
in
the
hearings
was
focused
on
the
question
as
to
why
the
charter
did
not
also
include
a
right
to
sue
in
foreign
courts.
and
there
is--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--at
the
very
beginning,
his
explanation
of
it?
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
we
believe
that
that
is
a
precursor,
and
substantially
means
the
same
thing
as
the
explanation
and
the
discussion
after
recommendation
22,
which
states
that
what
they
meant
by
that
was
that
there
was
a
doubt
regarding
the
jurisdiction
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
capacity.
it
refers
to
right
to
sue.
