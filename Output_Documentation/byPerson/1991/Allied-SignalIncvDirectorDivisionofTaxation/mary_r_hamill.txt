ms.
mary
r.
hamill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
pleased
to
be
asked
back
to
address
the
court's
questions.
as
you
know,
we
argued
initially
that
there
was
no
need
to
overrule
asarco
and
woolworth,
provided
that
the
court
would
clarify
the
statements
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
that
there
has
to
be
an
operating
relationship
between
the
payor
and
payee
of
dividend
income
in
order
to
apportion
that
income.
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
clear
up
the
confusion
and
dispel
the
misconceptions
that
those
opinions
have
generated,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
should
overrule
the
two
opinions,
and
once
you
get
to
that
point...
and
it
should
do
so
retroactively.
but
once
you
get
to
that
point,
then
the
question
is,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
and
how
do
you
apportion,
and
we
see
no
bright
line,
no
clear
line
until
you
go
all
the
way
to
the
corporate
entity.
and
so
we
say
that
what
is
received
as
income
by
the
corporation,
by
a
nondomiciliary
corporation
that
is
doing
business
in
the
taxing
state,
should
be
apportioned
by
that
state,
and
the
reason
we
believe
that
is
correct
is
that
when
there
is
a
common
corporate
management,
there
are
inevitably
going
to
be
flows
of
value.
there
are
inevitably
going
to
be
mutual
interdependence,
no
matter
how
disparate
these
activities
seem,
the
parking
lot,
the
beauty
parlor.
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
there
may
be
borrowing
going
back
and
forth.
there
may
be
tax
losses
offsetting
one
or
another.
there
may
be
the
need
for
geographical
diversification.
there
may
be
a
william
agee
running
both
of
those
who
sees
that
there
is
money
to
be
made
in
beauty
parlors
in
new
jersey
and
he
can
generate
capital
to
go
into
parking
lots
in
california.
the
permutations
of
that
are
infinite,
and
to
ask
the
lower
courts
and
the
taxing
authorities
to
pull
apart
these
very
fine,
intricate
distinctions
is
really
asking
too
much,
and
it
is
getting
into
the
very
area
that
the
court
addressed
with
the
exception
to
the
corn
products...
the
corn
products
exception
to
the
statutory
definition
of
capital
assets
where
we
were
talking
about
business
motive.
if
the
motive
for
acquiring
an
asset
was
to
further
the
business,
it
wasn't
a
capital
asset,
and
therefore,
it
generated
an
ordinary
loss
on
sale,
the
court
saw
that
problem
and
got
rid
of
it
in
arkansas
best
and
severely
limited
the
corn
products
doctrine.
and
it
really
seems
to
us
that
we
have
got
to
move
that--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we
think
it
is
not
out
the
window.
we
think
that
we
are
trying
to--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--why
can't
you
define
it
at
the
corporate
level?
why
can't
you
say
that
the
unitary
ties
are
brought
about
by
that
management,
that
that
is
the
out-of-state
activity
that
is
tying
the
out-of-state
activity
to--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--justice
o'connor,
i
want
to
answer
that
question
by...
the
way
you
asked
that
question
makes
me
wonder
about
this
combined
reporting
issue
again.
we
don't
tax
the
income
of
the
subsidiary.
we
tax
the
dividends--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--and
so
we
don't
care
what
happens
to
that
subsidiary,
where
it
is,
what
it
does--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we...
the
fact,
the
double
taxation
that
would
result
would
be,
i
think
what
mr.
hellerstein
was
talking
about,
where
you
have
a
uditpa
state
that
says,
this
particular
kind
of
income
is
allocable
entirely
to
the
commercial
domicile.
for
instance,
take
the
gain
on
the
sale
of
real
estate
located
in
a
uditpa
state;
if
the
uditpa
state
said
that
was
nonbusiness
income,
that
is,
not
related
to
the
business
being
carried
on,
it
would
then
say
that
the
entire
gain
should
be
allocated
to
that
state.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
then
it
would
be
apportionable.
we
meanwhile,
under
our
theory,
would
say
it
is
all
apportionable
because
it
is
all,
that
gain
is
received
by
the
company
that
is
doing
business
in
new
jersey.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
so.
not
every
state
would
have
called
this
particular
gain
business
income,
but
under
that
business
income
definition,
i
believe
there
is
a
transactional
test
and
a
functional
test,
and
we
would
arguably
meet
the
functional
test
broadly
defined.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
that
follows
logically
from
what
we
are
saying,
but
what
we
are
trying
very
hard
to
do
is
not
to
upset
the
taxing
schemes
of
the
majority
of
the
states,
not
to
upset
the
combined
reporting
states.
we
are
just--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
no--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we
say,
first
off,
you
have
that
problem
already,
because
you
can
have
a
uditpa
state
characterizing
something
as
nonbusiness
income
and
a
full
apportionment
state
saying
it
is
business
income.
but
say,
if
we
do
admit
that
what
we
are
advocating
will
increase
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--what
is
business
income,
that's
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
all
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
think
the
basis
for
the
taxation
is.
if
you
think
it's
that
the
benefits
and
protections
that
are
being
extended
by
a
state
justify
the
tax,
you
could
very
well
find
that
the
uditpa
state
that
is
trying
to
tax
it
all
has
a
sufficient
basis
for
doing
that
because
the
management
is
there,
the
income
may
be...
there
is
a
connection
with
that
state.
on
the
other
hand--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--on
the
other
hand,
i
think
our...
in
that
situation,
we
would
have
a
sufficient
basis
too,
and
we
would
be
right
into
the
court's
cases,
the
intangible
personal
property
cases
and
the
personal
income
tax
cases.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
oh,
i
think
the
basis...
i
think
it
is
the
benefits
and
protections
are
extended.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
they
can
both
tax,
and
i
think
the
court's
cases
dealing
with
intangible
property,
curry
v.
mccanless
and
the
very
common
scheme
under
the
personal
income
tax
where
the
state
of
residence
can
tax
all
an
individual's
income
and
the
state
where
that
individual
earns
wages
or
whatever
can
tax
the
wages,
you
have
absolute,
inevitable
double
taxation.
and
the
only
reason
it
doesn't
happen
in
practice
is
that
the
state
of
residence
grants
a
credit.
but
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--true,
but
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
promulgate
a
constitutional
rule
that
says,
favors
one
state
over
another,
you
are
taking
on
more
than
just
this
case
and
just
the
apportionment
of
income
in
the
context
of
multi-state
businesses
and
the
corporate
net
income
taxes,
because
you
are
talking
on
the
intangible
personal
property
tax
cases
and
the
personal
income
tax
cases.
ideally,
i
think
you
are
absolutely
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
no.
we
think
that
florida
could
treat
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--could
do
it
either
way
because
the
constitution
sets
limits,
and
if
there
is
nothing
constitutionally
wrong
with
what
florida
wants
to
do,
it
can
go
ahead
and
do
it.
but
that
doesn't
get...
then
you
have
the
double
taxation
problem.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
no,
it
might
very
well
occur.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
oh,
all
right,
then
perhaps
not.
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
right,
yes.
but
let
me
talk
just
a
minute
about
this
risk
of
double
taxation.
you
know,
we
had
32
corporations
filing
amicus
briefs
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
and
i
don't
know
if
you
read
our
reply
brief
and
looked
at
the
appendix,
but
20
of
those
32
corporations
are
domiciled
in
states
that
do
apportion
all
income,
two-thirds
of
them,
no
possibility
of
double
taxation
at
all.
then
again--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--oh,
sure,
they
could.
but
if
full
apportionment
were
to
be
the
rule
and
they
are
already
doing
full
apportionment,
i
don't
know
why...
and
they
are
allowed
to
bring
in
more,
i
don't
know
why
they
would
change.
but
let
me
just
go
on
a
minute
with
this
risk
of
double
taxation.
then
you
have
to
have
the
uditpa
states
say,
okay,
this
is
nonbusiness
income,
but
there
is
a
presumption
in
the
multi-state
tax
commission
regulations,
i
think
it
is
in
uditpa
as
well,
that
income
is
business
income,
apportionable.
then
you
have
to
have
a
situation
where
in
fact
there
is
double
taxation
and
if
you
look
at
the
laws
of
all
the
states
you
find
that
the
vast
majority
of
them
have
very
substantial
exclusions
for
dividend
income.
dividend
income,
of
course,
is
the
major
recurring
kind
of
intangible
income.
70
to
100
percent
of
dividend
income
is
excluded
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
states.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
i
don't
think
we
ought
to
rewrite
uditpa.
there
may
be
movements--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
you
aren't,
because
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
a
uditpa
state
saying,
we
don't
want
to
apportion.
we
are
happy
with
trying
to
make
this
distinction
between
property,
intangible
property
that
is
integrated
with
the
business.
we
want
to
do
it.
we
like
it
that
way.
why
should
the
court
or
why
should
we
suggest
that
they
not
do
it?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
part
of
federalism
that
they
be
able
to
go
on
and
do
exactly
that.
we
just
say
that
we
don't
think
it
is
required
by
the
due
process
clause
and
we
don't
really
have
the
ability
to
keep
on
trying
to
make
these
distinctions.
it
is
very,
very
difficult.
let
me
just
turn
just
a
minute
to
the
theoretical
basis
on
which
allied
grounds
its
argument
which
is
that...
the
source
argument,
in
that
a
nondomiciliary
state
can
tax
only
on
a
source
basis,
and
that
there
must
be
a
relationship,
a
direct
relationship
between
the
activities
generating
the
income
from
out-of-state
and
what's
going
on
in
the
taxing
state.
i
don't
think
you
find
that
in
the
court's
cases,
except
possibly
in
asarco
and
woolworth.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
been
so
explicit,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
single
corporate
management
couldn't
provide
that
unifying
factor
that
would
make
it
sensible
to
say
that
all
of
the
income
of
a
single
corporation
is
unitary
income.
the
property
tax
cases
on
which
allied
relies...
fargo
v.
hart,
adams
express,
pullman's
palace
car...
are
property
tax
cases
and
the
difference
is
that
they
are
valuing
tangible
property
in
the
state,
and
you
can
look
at
that
property.
and
you
could
see
in
fargo
v.
hart
that
there
was
$8,000
worth
of
property,
tangible
property
in
the
state
and
the
apportionment
formula
put
$800,000
of
property
in
the
state.
and
when
it
is
property
that
you
can
see
and
there
is
a
benchmark,
it
gets
stuck
in
your
craw
when
you
say
that
the
out-of-state
values
did
that
much
for
this
tangible
property
in-state.
but
income
is
very
different,
you
can't
see
it,
you
can
only
measure
it
indirectly.
you
certainly
don't
know
where
it
is
earned,
and
so
that
there
is
a
great
deal
more
flux,
a
great
deal
more
uncertainty
in
where
income
is
sourced.
the
other
problem
that
i
think
mr.
hellerstein
didn't
quite
get
to,
but
i
know
he
has
5
minutes,
and
so
i
guess
i
had
better...
and
i
don't
have
any
more
time,
so
after
i
sit
down...
is
the
question
i
think
of
the
chaos.
and
i
think
he
probably
would
start
with
the
lack
of
fair
apportionment,
that
by
putting
all
the
income
in
the
base
and
then
going
to
the
apportionment
formula
you
are
going
to
have
terrible,
terrible
misattributions
of
income.
we
don't
think
that
is
necessarily
true.
we
think
that
if
you
make
the
decision
that
the
intangible
is
related
to
the
business,
it
is
legitimate
to
use
the
three-factor
formula,
perhaps
some
modification
of
the
formula
to
apportion
all
of
that
income.
it
isn't
necessarily
a
misattribution
of
income.
working
capital
is
apportioned,
traditionally,
income
from
working
capital,
using
the
three-factor
formula.
very
often
when
dividends
are
determined
to
be
business
income,
apportioned
using
the
three-factor
formula.
if
too
much
income
is
being
taxed
in
a
particular
state,
the
taxing
authority,
the
lower
courts
can
deal
with
that.
they
can
deal
with
the
apportionment
formula--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--because
the
formula,
i
am
talking
about
the
three-factor
formula,
you
could
for
instance
decide
that
you
should
put
intangible
property
in
the
denominator
of
the
property
factor.
that
would
be
the
simplest
thing
to
do.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
you
know,
over
the
past
10
years,
the
states
have
really
been
sort
of
up
against
a
wall
with
asarco
and
woolworth
and
really
losing
large
amounts
of
income
out
of
the
base.
i
think
if
you
give
the
apportionment
formula
a
chance
to
work,
that
the
states
will
see
that
it
has
got
to
be
used,
particularly
if
all
income
in
the
base--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
i
don't
think
the
world
will
ever
be
the
same
after
asarco
and
woolworth,
and
i
think
the
states
have
learned
a
lesson.
you
can't
be
too
piggy.
you
have
really
got
to
realize
that
in
some
cases
where
there
is
recurring...
a
huge,
huge
investment
portfolio
with
none
of
the,
none
of
the
generative
assets
in
the
formula
may
very
well
create
distortion.
but
the
states
can
and
should
deal
with
that.
this
court
can
deal
with
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--i
think
the
court--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--again,
though,
i
think
that
you
ought
to
give
the
apportionment
formula
a
chance
to
work
and
it
may
very
well
work,
and
you
may
though
have
a
couple
of
apportionment
cases
where
a
state
is
being
piggy
and
refuses
to
see
the
light,
refuses
to
make
any--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--i
think
that
courts
have
managed
to
do
it.
judge
cardozo
sitting
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
no
trouble--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--you
did,
you
certainly
did.
there
is
no
question
that
asarco
and
woolworth
in
one
sense,
they
are
a
very
workable
rule,
they
just
plain--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--they
just
limit
the
states...
but
they
limit
it
in
this
unreal
fashion
and
truly
unreal
fashion,
as
i
think
justice
kennedy
is
pointing
out.
nothing
to
do
with
the
way
corporations
are--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
if
we
were
a
congressional
committee,
we
could
fix
it
all
at
once,
but
i
think
you
are
absolutely
right.
i
think
the
apportionment
formula
is
probably
as
outdated
as
fargo
v.
hart
and
pullman's
palace
car.
but
we
don't
have
that
issue
here--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--that's
right,
i
am
saying
one
thing
at
a
time,
you
can't--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--bendix
has
given
up.
bendix
gave
up
on
the
apportionment
formula.
we
argued,
in
fact,
in
the
tax
court
of
new
jersey,
bendix
said,
okay,
if
it's
unitary
you
have
to
put
the
factors
of
asarco
into
the
apportionment
formula.
we
said,
that
is
not
appropriate
because
these
are
minority
stock
investments
and
this
is
not
a
combined
report.
but
we
do
think
that
it
ought
to
be
tested
by
putting
the
value
of
the
asarco
stock,
the
intangible
value
into
the
property
factor.
we
already
have
the
receipts
in
the
denominator
of
the
receipts
factor,
that
is,
the
gain
itself,
in
the
denominator,
by
the
way,
of
course,
which
lessens
what
new
jersey
can
tax.
we
did
the
math.
the
state
did
the
math.
we
determined
that
the
tax
differential
was
extremely
small.
bendix
never
challenged
those
figures,
never
produced
any
evidence,
never
did
a
thing,
and
the
new
jersey
tax
court
ruled
that
bendix
had
not
succeeded
in
establishing
any
unfairness
in
the
apportionment
formula.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
are
you
asking
whether
they
have
the--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--the
power
to
get
the
tax
records,
or
do
you
mean
to
include
the
income?
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
no,
because
again
i
think
if
these
activities
are
in
a
single
corporation
run
by
single
management
there
are
flows
of
value.
and
of
course,
the
apportionment
formula
under
your
hypothetical
is
going
to
take
care
of
problems--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--it
is
a
tiny
tax.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
it
is
a
step,
it
certainly
is
a
step,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
totally
out
of...
it
is
not
an
enormous
step.
it
is
a
small
step.
the
court's
cases,
i
mean,
starting
with
butler
brothers,
which
involved
the
wholesale
distribution
houses--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--geographically
separate,
the
one
in
california--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--under
that
hypothetical,
under
my
situation,
we
would
still
say
you
put
it
in
the
base,
but
you
are
going
to
have
to
do
an
adjustment
somehow
to
the
apportionment
formula.
but
of
course,
we
don't
agree
with
your
premise,
which
is
that
you
can
separate
them--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--totally,
totally,
separate,
that's
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
no--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--is
going
to
be--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
i
think
we
would
say
it
has
to
be
the
same
management,
i
think
we
maybe
misspoke
a
little
bit--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--but
you
have
got
a
corporate
president.
you
have
got
a
corporate
management
that
is
saying,
okay,
we
are
going
to
put
it
in
the
parking
lot
or
we
are
going
to
put
it
in
the
major
operations
that
are
in
the
west.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
just
management
without
putting
in
the
fact
that
it's
being...
that
there
are
some
people
in
there
calling
the
shots
and
making
it
unitary.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
but
the
fact
that
they
have
bought
that
stock,
that
they
think
that
stock
is
worth
having
and
not
selling,
that
they
see...
corporations
don't
invest--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we
are
saying
it
is
defined
differently,
and
we
are
trying
to
keep
it,
justice
white;
we
think
it
does
apply
in
combined
reporting
situations.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
that's
the
bendix,
it
is
william
agee
all
over
again
doing
exactly
what
he
did.
if
i
might
i
would
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
if
the
court
should
overrule
asarco
and
woolworth,
we
believe
it
should
do
so
retroactively.
we
believe
that
asarco
and
woolworth
were
not
the
kind
of
clear
precedent
on
which
litigants
relied
under
the
chevron
oil
test.
no
prior
case
had
formulated
an
exclusive
test
of
operating
relationships
between
payor
and
payee.
corporate
purpose
had
been
sanctioned,
indeed,
in
adams
express
company
the
court
had
said,
quote,
presumptively,
all
the
property
of
the
corporation
is
held
and
used
for
the
purposes
of
its
business,
close
quote.
one
year
after
asarco
and
woolworth
were
decided,
the
court
decided
container,
it
may
have
referred
to
asarco,
not
attacked
it
head-on,
but
the
reasoning
in
container
in
many,
many
respects
undercuts
asarco.
the
recognition
that
the
california
code
tracks
uditpa
and
the
definition
of
business
and
nonbusiness
income
is
a
subtle
attack
on
the...
and
the
rejection
of
the
corporate
purpose
doctrine
in
asarco
and
woolworth
because
that
corporate
purpose
doctrine
really
does
come
out
of
uditpa.
it
may
have
been
formulated
in
a
rather
generalized
way,
but
it
is
the
uditpa
test.
it
sanctions,
container
sanctions
a
business
purpose
for
making
an
investment
unitary,
and
that
is
footnote
19
that
talks
about
the
purpose
of
making
loans
to
the
subsidiaries,
again,
totally
different
from
asarco
and
woolworth.
container
sanctions
reliance
on
the
potential
to
control;
whereas,
asarco
and
woolworth
required
actual,
operating
control.
container
sanctioned
the
presumption
that
companies
engaged
in
similar
lines
of
business
are
unitary,
but
woolworth
was
engaged
in
exactly
the
same
line
of
business
as
its
subsidiaries,
and
asarco's
subs
were
in
segments
of
asarco's
business.
it
rejects
the
bright
line
test
that
there
must
be
flows
of
product,
and
it
puts
the
burden
of
proof
back
on
to
the
taxpayer,
and
if
you
read
asarco
it
is
quite
clear
that
all
the
gaps,
all
the
deficiencies
in
the
record
were
construed
against
the
state.
so
container
undercut
asarco
and
woolworth
and
after
container
no
corporate
taxpayer
had
a
legitimate
reliance
interest
in
asarco
and
woolworth.
and
then
of
course,
asarco
and
woolworth
have
provoked
repeated
litigation
in
the
state
courts.
the
lower
courts
tried
to
square
those
rulings
with
their
notions
of
common
sense,
tried
to
follow
them
and
had
a
very
difficult
time
doing
it.
we
think
the
prospective
application
would
not
further
a
new
rule
of
law.
we
have
been
hurt
by
the
asarco/woolworth
rule.
we,
the
state's
fisc...
the
state's
sovereign
ability
to
tax,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
and
to
promote,
to
have
a
new
rule
and
then
not
let
us
have
the
benefit
of
it
retroactively
would
be
very
harmful
to
new
jersey.
the
equities,
for
a
similar
reason
favor,
we
think,
retroactive
overruling.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
no.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
absolutely,
1
percent,
because
it
is
not,
you
see,
this
control.
it
is
the
way
it
is
used.
it
is
the
way
the
investment
is
used.
to
conclude,
very
briefly,
again,
i
think
allied
is
trying
to
paint
new
jersey
as
taking
a
very
radical
position.
it
relies
on
cases
decided
a
century
ago,
but
we
have
repeatedly
pointed
out
in
this
case,
this
not
the
way
companies
operate
today.
today
they
use
their
investments
interchangeably
with
their
manufacturing
assets.
the
days
of
pullman's
palace
car,
adams
express
company
and
fargo
v.
hart
are
gone
forever.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
unitary
business
principle,
but
it
has
to
be
brought
into
the
modern
world.
the
court
will
look
in
vain
through
everything
that
allied
has
said
about
how
companies
invest,
how
they
act,
how
they
really
manage
these
investments,
and
there
is
nothing
there.
what
they
want
is
a
constitutional
formulary
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
present-day
economic
reality.
and
what
we
are
proposing
is
a
rule
that
we
think
is
consistent
with
economic
reality,
that
is
clear
and
predictable,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
and
puts
the
issue
of
the
division
of
the
tax
base
where
it
belongs,
which
is
under
the
apportionment
formula.
thank
you.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
pleased
to
be
asked
back
to
address
the
court's
questions.
as
you
know,
we
argued
initially
that
there
was
no
need
to
overrule
asarco
and
woolworth,
provided
that
the
court
would
clarify
the
statements
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
that
there
has
to
be
an
operating
relationship
between
the
payor
and
payee
of
dividend
income
in
order
to
apportion
that
income.
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
clear
up
the
confusion
and
dispel
the
misconceptions
that
those
opinions
have
generated,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
should
overrule
the
two
opinions,
and
once
you
get
to
that
point...
and
it
should
do
so
retroactively.
but
once
you
get
to
that
point,
then
the
question
is,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
and
how
do
you
apportion,
and
we
see
no
bright
line,
no
clear
line
until
you
go
all
the
way
to
the
corporate
entity.
and
so
we
say
that
what
is
received
as
income
by
the
corporation,
by
a
nondomiciliary
corporation
that
is
doing
business
in
the
taxing
state,
should
be
apportioned
by
that
state,
and
the
reason
we
believe
that
is
correct
is
that
when
there
is
a
common
corporate
management,
there
are
inevitably
going
to
be
flows
of
value.
there
are
inevitably
going
to
be
mutual
interdependence,
no
matter
how
disparate
these
activities
seem,
the
parking
lot,
the
beauty
parlor.
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
there
may
be
borrowing
going
back
and
forth.
there
may
be
tax
losses
offsetting
one
or
another.
there
may
be
the
need
for
geographical
diversification.
there
may
be
a
william
agee
running
both
of
those
who
sees
that
there
is
money
to
be
made
in
beauty
parlors
in
new
jersey
and
he
can
generate
capital
to
go
into
parking
lots
in
california.
the
permutations
of
that
are
infinite,
and
to
ask
the
lower
courts
and
the
taxing
authorities
to
pull
apart
these
very
fine,
intricate
distinctions
is
really
asking
too
much,
and
it
is
getting
into
the
very
area
that
the
court
addressed
with
the
exception
to
the
corn
products...
the
corn
products
exception
to
the
statutory
definition
of
capital
assets
where
we
were
talking
about
business
motive.
if
the
motive
for
acquiring
an
asset
was
to
further
the
business,
it
wasn't
a
capital
asset,
and
therefore,
it
generated
an
ordinary
loss
on
sale,
the
court
saw
that
problem
and
got
rid
of
it
in
arkansas
best
and
severely
limited
the
corn
products
doctrine.
and
it
really
seems
to
us
that
we
have
got
to
move
that--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we
think
it
is
not
out
the
window.
we
think
that
we
are
trying
to--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--why
can't
you
define
it
at
the
corporate
level?
why
can't
you
say
that
the
unitary
ties
are
brought
about
by
that
management,
that
that
is
the
out-of-state
activity
that
is
tying
the
out-of-state
activity
to--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--justice
o'connor,
i
want
to
answer
that
question
by...
the
way
you
asked
that
question
makes
me
wonder
about
this
combined
reporting
issue
again.
we
don't
tax
the
income
of
the
subsidiary.
we
tax
the
dividends--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--and
so
we
don't
care
what
happens
to
that
subsidiary,
where
it
is,
what
it
does--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we...
the
fact,
the
double
taxation
that
would
result
would
be,
i
think
what
mr.
hellerstein
was
talking
about,
where
you
have
a
uditpa
state
that
says,
this
particular
kind
of
income
is
allocable
entirely
to
the
commercial
domicile.
for
instance,
take
the
gain
on
the
sale
of
real
estate
located
in
a
uditpa
state;
if
the
uditpa
state
said
that
was
nonbusiness
income,
that
is,
not
related
to
the
business
being
carried
on,
it
would
then
say
that
the
entire
gain
should
be
allocated
to
that
state.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
then
it
would
be
apportionable.
we
meanwhile,
under
our
theory,
would
say
it
is
all
apportionable
because
it
is
all,
that
gain
is
received
by
the
company
that
is
doing
business
in
new
jersey.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
so.
not
every
state
would
have
called
this
particular
gain
business
income,
but
under
that
business
income
definition,
i
believe
there
is
a
transactional
test
and
a
functional
test,
and
we
would
arguably
meet
the
functional
test
broadly
defined.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
that
follows
logically
from
what
we
are
saying,
but
what
we
are
trying
very
hard
to
do
is
not
to
upset
the
taxing
schemes
of
the
majority
of
the
states,
not
to
upset
the
combined
reporting
states.
we
are
just--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
no--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we
say,
first
off,
you
have
that
problem
already,
because
you
can
have
a
uditpa
state
characterizing
something
as
nonbusiness
income
and
a
full
apportionment
state
saying
it
is
business
income.
but
say,
if
we
do
admit
that
what
we
are
advocating
will
increase
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--what
is
business
income,
that's
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
all
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
think
the
basis
for
the
taxation
is.
if
you
think
it's
that
the
benefits
and
protections
that
are
being
extended
by
a
state
justify
the
tax,
you
could
very
well
find
that
the
uditpa
state
that
is
trying
to
tax
it
all
has
a
sufficient
basis
for
doing
that
because
the
management
is
there,
the
income
may
be...
there
is
a
connection
with
that
state.
on
the
other
hand--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--on
the
other
hand,
i
think
our...
in
that
situation,
we
would
have
a
sufficient
basis
too,
and
we
would
be
right
into
the
court's
cases,
the
intangible
personal
property
cases
and
the
personal
income
tax
cases.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
oh,
i
think
the
basis...
i
think
it
is
the
benefits
and
protections
are
extended.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
they
can
both
tax,
and
i
think
the
court's
cases
dealing
with
intangible
property,
curry
v.
mccanless
and
the
very
common
scheme
under
the
personal
income
tax
where
the
state
of
residence
can
tax
all
an
individual's
income
and
the
state
where
that
individual
earns
wages
or
whatever
can
tax
the
wages,
you
have
absolute,
inevitable
double
taxation.
and
the
only
reason
it
doesn't
happen
in
practice
is
that
the
state
of
residence
grants
a
credit.
but
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--true,
but
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
promulgate
a
constitutional
rule
that
says,
favors
one
state
over
another,
you
are
taking
on
more
than
just
this
case
and
just
the
apportionment
of
income
in
the
context
of
multi-state
businesses
and
the
corporate
net
income
taxes,
because
you
are
talking
on
the
intangible
personal
property
tax
cases
and
the
personal
income
tax
cases.
ideally,
i
think
you
are
absolutely
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
no.
we
think
that
florida
could
treat
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--could
do
it
either
way
because
the
constitution
sets
limits,
and
if
there
is
nothing
constitutionally
wrong
with
what
florida
wants
to
do,
it
can
go
ahead
and
do
it.
but
that
doesn't
get...
then
you
have
the
double
taxation
problem.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
no,
it
might
very
well
occur.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
oh,
all
right,
then
perhaps
not.
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
right,
yes.
but
let
me
talk
just
a
minute
about
this
risk
of
double
taxation.
you
know,
we
had
32
corporations
filing
amicus
briefs
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
and
i
don't
know
if
you
read
our
reply
brief
and
looked
at
the
appendix,
but
20
of
those
32
corporations
are
domiciled
in
states
that
do
apportion
all
income,
two-thirds
of
them,
no
possibility
of
double
taxation
at
all.
then
again--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--oh,
sure,
they
could.
but
if
full
apportionment
were
to
be
the
rule
and
they
are
already
doing
full
apportionment,
i
don't
know
why...
and
they
are
allowed
to
bring
in
more,
i
don't
know
why
they
would
change.
but
let
me
just
go
on
a
minute
with
this
risk
of
double
taxation.
then
you
have
to
have
the
uditpa
states
say,
okay,
this
is
nonbusiness
income,
but
there
is
a
presumption
in
the
multi-state
tax
commission
regulations,
i
think
it
is
in
uditpa
as
well,
that
income
is
business
income,
apportionable.
then
you
have
to
have
a
situation
where
in
fact
there
is
double
taxation
and
if
you
look
at
the
laws
of
all
the
states
you
find
that
the
vast
majority
of
them
have
very
substantial
exclusions
for
dividend
income.
dividend
income,
of
course,
is
the
major
recurring
kind
of
intangible
income.
70
to
100
percent
of
dividend
income
is
excluded
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
states.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
i
don't
think
we
ought
to
rewrite
uditpa.
there
may
be
movements--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
you
aren't,
because
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
a
uditpa
state
saying,
we
don't
want
to
apportion.
we
are
happy
with
trying
to
make
this
distinction
between
property,
intangible
property
that
is
integrated
with
the
business.
we
want
to
do
it.
we
like
it
that
way.
why
should
the
court
or
why
should
we
suggest
that
they
not
do
it?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
part
of
federalism
that
they
be
able
to
go
on
and
do
exactly
that.
we
just
say
that
we
don't
think
it
is
required
by
the
due
process
clause
and
we
don't
really
have
the
ability
to
keep
on
trying
to
make
these
distinctions.
it
is
very,
very
difficult.
let
me
just
turn
just
a
minute
to
the
theoretical
basis
on
which
allied
grounds
its
argument
which
is
that...
the
source
argument,
in
that
a
nondomiciliary
state
can
tax
only
on
a
source
basis,
and
that
there
must
be
a
relationship,
a
direct
relationship
between
the
activities
generating
the
income
from
out-of-state
and
what's
going
on
in
the
taxing
state.
i
don't
think
you
find
that
in
the
court's
cases,
except
possibly
in
asarco
and
woolworth.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
been
so
explicit,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
single
corporate
management
couldn't
provide
that
unifying
factor
that
would
make
it
sensible
to
say
that
all
of
the
income
of
a
single
corporation
is
unitary
income.
the
property
tax
cases
on
which
allied
relies...
fargo
v.
hart,
adams
express,
pullman's
palace
car...
are
property
tax
cases
and
the
difference
is
that
they
are
valuing
tangible
property
in
the
state,
and
you
can
look
at
that
property.
and
you
could
see
in
fargo
v.
hart
that
there
was
$8,000
worth
of
property,
tangible
property
in
the
state
and
the
apportionment
formula
put
$800,000
of
property
in
the
state.
and
when
it
is
property
that
you
can
see
and
there
is
a
benchmark,
it
gets
stuck
in
your
craw
when
you
say
that
the
out-of-state
values
did
that
much
for
this
tangible
property
in-state.
but
income
is
very
different,
you
can't
see
it,
you
can
only
measure
it
indirectly.
you
certainly
don't
know
where
it
is
earned,
and
so
that
there
is
a
great
deal
more
flux,
a
great
deal
more
uncertainty
in
where
income
is
sourced.
the
other
problem
that
i
think
mr.
hellerstein
didn't
quite
get
to,
but
i
know
he
has
5
minutes,
and
so
i
guess
i
had
better...
and
i
don't
have
any
more
time,
so
after
i
sit
down...
is
the
question
i
think
of
the
chaos.
and
i
think
he
probably
would
start
with
the
lack
of
fair
apportionment,
that
by
putting
all
the
income
in
the
base
and
then
going
to
the
apportionment
formula
you
are
going
to
have
terrible,
terrible
misattributions
of
income.
we
don't
think
that
is
necessarily
true.
we
think
that
if
you
make
the
decision
that
the
intangible
is
related
to
the
business,
it
is
legitimate
to
use
the
three-factor
formula,
perhaps
some
modification
of
the
formula
to
apportion
all
of
that
income.
it
isn't
necessarily
a
misattribution
of
income.
working
capital
is
apportioned,
traditionally,
income
from
working
capital,
using
the
three-factor
formula.
very
often
when
dividends
are
determined
to
be
business
income,
apportioned
using
the
three-factor
formula.
if
too
much
income
is
being
taxed
in
a
particular
state,
the
taxing
authority,
the
lower
courts
can
deal
with
that.
they
can
deal
with
the
apportionment
formula--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--because
the
formula,
i
am
talking
about
the
three-factor
formula,
you
could
for
instance
decide
that
you
should
put
intangible
property
in
the
denominator
of
the
property
factor.
that
would
be
the
simplest
thing
to
do.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
you
know,
over
the
past
10
years,
the
states
have
really
been
sort
of
up
against
a
wall
with
asarco
and
woolworth
and
really
losing
large
amounts
of
income
out
of
the
base.
i
think
if
you
give
the
apportionment
formula
a
chance
to
work,
that
the
states
will
see
that
it
has
got
to
be
used,
particularly
if
all
income
in
the
base--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
i
don't
think
the
world
will
ever
be
the
same
after
asarco
and
woolworth,
and
i
think
the
states
have
learned
a
lesson.
you
can't
be
too
piggy.
you
have
really
got
to
realize
that
in
some
cases
where
there
is
recurring...
a
huge,
huge
investment
portfolio
with
none
of
the,
none
of
the
generative
assets
in
the
formula
may
very
well
create
distortion.
but
the
states
can
and
should
deal
with
that.
this
court
can
deal
with
it--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--i
think
the
court--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--again,
though,
i
think
that
you
ought
to
give
the
apportionment
formula
a
chance
to
work
and
it
may
very
well
work,
and
you
may
though
have
a
couple
of
apportionment
cases
where
a
state
is
being
piggy
and
refuses
to
see
the
light,
refuses
to
make
any--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--i
think
that
courts
have
managed
to
do
it.
judge
cardozo
sitting
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
no
trouble--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--you
did,
you
certainly
did.
there
is
no
question
that
asarco
and
woolworth
in
one
sense,
they
are
a
very
workable
rule,
they
just
plain--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--they
just
limit
the
states...
but
they
limit
it
in
this
unreal
fashion
and
truly
unreal
fashion,
as
i
think
justice
kennedy
is
pointing
out.
nothing
to
do
with
the
way
corporations
are--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
if
we
were
a
congressional
committee,
we
could
fix
it
all
at
once,
but
i
think
you
are
absolutely
right.
i
think
the
apportionment
formula
is
probably
as
outdated
as
fargo
v.
hart
and
pullman's
palace
car.
but
we
don't
have
that
issue
here--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--that's
right,
i
am
saying
one
thing
at
a
time,
you
can't--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--bendix
has
given
up.
bendix
gave
up
on
the
apportionment
formula.
we
argued,
in
fact,
in
the
tax
court
of
new
jersey,
bendix
said,
okay,
if
it's
unitary
you
have
to
put
the
factors
of
asarco
into
the
apportionment
formula.
we
said,
that
is
not
appropriate
because
these
are
minority
stock
investments
and
this
is
not
a
combined
report.
but
we
do
think
that
it
ought
to
be
tested
by
putting
the
value
of
the
asarco
stock,
the
intangible
value
into
the
property
factor.
we
already
have
the
receipts
in
the
denominator
of
the
receipts
factor,
that
is,
the
gain
itself,
in
the
denominator,
by
the
way,
of
course,
which
lessens
what
new
jersey
can
tax.
we
did
the
math.
the
state
did
the
math.
we
determined
that
the
tax
differential
was
extremely
small.
bendix
never
challenged
those
figures,
never
produced
any
evidence,
never
did
a
thing,
and
the
new
jersey
tax
court
ruled
that
bendix
had
not
succeeded
in
establishing
any
unfairness
in
the
apportionment
formula.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
are
you
asking
whether
they
have
the--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--the
power
to
get
the
tax
records,
or
do
you
mean
to
include
the
income?
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
no,
because
again
i
think
if
these
activities
are
in
a
single
corporation
run
by
single
management
there
are
flows
of
value.
and
of
course,
the
apportionment
formula
under
your
hypothetical
is
going
to
take
care
of
problems--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--it
is
a
tiny
tax.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
i
think
it
is
a
step,
it
certainly
is
a
step,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
totally
out
of...
it
is
not
an
enormous
step.
it
is
a
small
step.
the
court's
cases,
i
mean,
starting
with
butler
brothers,
which
involved
the
wholesale
distribution
houses--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--geographically
separate,
the
one
in
california--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--under
that
hypothetical,
under
my
situation,
we
would
still
say
you
put
it
in
the
base,
but
you
are
going
to
have
to
do
an
adjustment
somehow
to
the
apportionment
formula.
but
of
course,
we
don't
agree
with
your
premise,
which
is
that
you
can
separate
them--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--totally,
totally,
separate,
that's
right.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well,
no--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--is
going
to
be--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--well,
i
think
we
would
say
it
has
to
be
the
same
management,
i
think
we
maybe
misspoke
a
little
bit--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--but
you
have
got
a
corporate
president.
you
have
got
a
corporate
management
that
is
saying,
okay,
we
are
going
to
put
it
in
the
parking
lot
or
we
are
going
to
put
it
in
the
major
operations
that
are
in
the
west.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
just
management
without
putting
in
the
fact
that
it's
being...
that
there
are
some
people
in
there
calling
the
shots
and
making
it
unitary.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
well--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--no,
but
the
fact
that
they
have
bought
that
stock,
that
they
think
that
stock
is
worth
having
and
not
selling,
that
they
see...
corporations
don't
invest--
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
--we
are
saying
it
is
defined
differently,
and
we
are
trying
to
keep
it,
justice
white;
we
think
it
does
apply
in
combined
reporting
situations.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
yes,
that's
the
bendix,
it
is
william
agee
all
over
again
doing
exactly
what
he
did.
if
i
might
i
would
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
if
the
court
should
overrule
asarco
and
woolworth,
we
believe
it
should
do
so
retroactively.
we
believe
that
asarco
and
woolworth
were
not
the
kind
of
clear
precedent
on
which
litigants
relied
under
the
chevron
oil
test.
no
prior
case
had
formulated
an
exclusive
test
of
operating
relationships
between
payor
and
payee.
corporate
purpose
had
been
sanctioned,
indeed,
in
adams
express
company
the
court
had
said,
quote,
presumptively,
all
the
property
of
the
corporation
is
held
and
used
for
the
purposes
of
its
business,
close
quote.
one
year
after
asarco
and
woolworth
were
decided,
the
court
decided
container,
it
may
have
referred
to
asarco,
not
attacked
it
head-on,
but
the
reasoning
in
container
in
many,
many
respects
undercuts
asarco.
the
recognition
that
the
california
code
tracks
uditpa
and
the
definition
of
business
and
nonbusiness
income
is
a
subtle
attack
on
the...
and
the
rejection
of
the
corporate
purpose
doctrine
in
asarco
and
woolworth
because
that
corporate
purpose
doctrine
really
does
come
out
of
uditpa.
it
may
have
been
formulated
in
a
rather
generalized
way,
but
it
is
the
uditpa
test.
it
sanctions,
container
sanctions
a
business
purpose
for
making
an
investment
unitary,
and
that
is
footnote
19
that
talks
about
the
purpose
of
making
loans
to
the
subsidiaries,
again,
totally
different
from
asarco
and
woolworth.
container
sanctions
reliance
on
the
potential
to
control;
whereas,
asarco
and
woolworth
required
actual,
operating
control.
container
sanctioned
the
presumption
that
companies
engaged
in
similar
lines
of
business
are
unitary,
but
woolworth
was
engaged
in
exactly
the
same
line
of
business
as
its
subsidiaries,
and
asarco's
subs
were
in
segments
of
asarco's
business.
it
rejects
the
bright
line
test
that
there
must
be
flows
of
product,
and
it
puts
the
burden
of
proof
back
on
to
the
taxpayer,
and
if
you
read
asarco
it
is
quite
clear
that
all
the
gaps,
all
the
deficiencies
in
the
record
were
construed
against
the
state.
so
container
undercut
asarco
and
woolworth
and
after
container
no
corporate
taxpayer
had
a
legitimate
reliance
interest
in
asarco
and
woolworth.
and
then
of
course,
asarco
and
woolworth
have
provoked
repeated
litigation
in
the
state
courts.
the
lower
courts
tried
to
square
those
rulings
with
their
notions
of
common
sense,
tried
to
follow
them
and
had
a
very
difficult
time
doing
it.
we
think
the
prospective
application
would
not
further
a
new
rule
of
law.
we
have
been
hurt
by
the
asarco/woolworth
rule.
we,
the
state's
fisc...
the
state's
sovereign
ability
to
tax,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
and
to
promote,
to
have
a
new
rule
and
then
not
let
us
have
the
benefit
of
it
retroactively
would
be
very
harmful
to
new
jersey.
the
equities,
for
a
similar
reason
favor,
we
think,
retroactive
overruling.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
no.
ms.
mary
r.
hamill
absolutely,
1
percent,
because
it
is
not,
you
see,
this
control.
it
is
the
way
it
is
used.
it
is
the
way
the
investment
is
used.
to
conclude,
very
briefly,
again,
i
think
allied
is
trying
to
paint
new
jersey
as
taking
a
very
radical
position.
it
relies
on
cases
decided
a
century
ago,
but
we
have
repeatedly
pointed
out
in
this
case,
this
not
the
way
companies
operate
today.
today
they
use
their
investments
interchangeably
with
their
manufacturing
assets.
the
days
of
pullman's
palace
car,
adams
express
company
and
fargo
v.
hart
are
gone
forever.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
unitary
business
principle,
but
it
has
to
be
brought
into
the
modern
world.
the
court
will
look
in
vain
through
everything
that
allied
has
said
about
how
companies
invest,
how
they
act,
how
they
really
manage
these
investments,
and
there
is
nothing
there.
what
they
want
is
a
constitutional
formulary
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
present-day
economic
reality.
and
what
we
are
proposing
is
a
rule
that
we
think
is
consistent
with
economic
reality,
that
is
clear
and
predictable,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
and
puts
the
issue
of
the
division
of
the
tax
base
where
it
belongs,
which
is
under
the
apportionment
formula.
thank
you.
