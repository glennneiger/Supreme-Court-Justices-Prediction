justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
the
petitioner
is
a
corporation.
it
is
called
allied-signal
and
it
is
the
successor
in
interest
to
the
bendix
corporation.
it
is
a
delaware
corporation
with
its
commercial
domicile
in
its
corporate
headquarters
in
michigan.
the
dispute
concerns
bendix's
business
tax
liability
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
september
30,
1981.
that
was
the
year
that
bendix
sold
something
over
a
20%
interest
in
a
corporation
called
asarco.
it
realized
a
gain
of
$211
million.
the
director
of
the
new
jersey
division
of
taxation
sought
to
include
that
$211
million
in
bendix's
apportionable
tax
base.
based
on
a
stipulated
record,
the
sate
tax
court
held
that
a
disputed
gain
was
properly
included
and
the
appellate
division
affirmed
that
decision
as
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
the
gain
was
earned
in
the
course
of
bendix's
so-called
unitary
business.
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
both
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
constitution
forbid
a
state
from
taxing
value
earned
outside
its
borders.
because
of
the
complications
and
uncertainties
in
allocating
the
income
of
multistate
business
to
this
several
states,
we
permit
the
states
to
tax
a
corporation
on
an
apportionable
share
of
the
multistate
business
that
is
carried
on
in
the
taxing
state.
this
is
the
unitary
business
principle
and
it
has
been
a
part
of
our
jurisprudence
for
over
a
century.
our
precedents
established
that
the
existence
of
the
unitary
business
depends
on
functional
integration,
centralization
of
management,
and
economies
of
scale.
we
adhere
to
those
decisions.
new
jersey
argues
that
all
income
earned
by
a
corporation
should
be
treated
as
income
earned
in
the
course
of
a
unitary
business.
principles
of
stare
decisis
prevent
us
from
adapting
the
sweeping
doctrinal
change.
it
is
not
in
accord
with
a
well-established
and
substantial
case
law
in
the
subject.
the
stipulated
record
in
this
case
makes
quite
clear
that
none
of
the
criteria
of
a
unitary
business
were
present.
bendix
had
no
capacity
to
control
asarco
and
they
were
run
as
separate
businesses.
while
we
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
several
amici
that
a
short
term
investment
of
idol
funds
which
serves
an
operational
function
maybe
apportionable
even
absent
a
unitary
relation
between
the
payer
and
he
payee.
the
record
in
this
case
makes
it
clear
that
bendix's
acquisition
and
disposition
of
its
asarco
shares
cannot
be
characterized
this
way.
therefore,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
blackmun,
and
justice
thomas
join.
