mr.
walter
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
essential
question
now
before
this
court
is
whether
there
must
exist
some
connection
beyond
the
mere
jurisdictional
presence
of
the
corporation
in
a
state
in
order
for
a
state
to
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
all
of
that
corporation's
income.
in
other
words,
must
a
state
have
some
connection
with
the
activities
of
produced
income
in
order
to
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
it?
we
believe
the
answer
to
this
question
is
yes
for
three
reasons
that
i'd
like
to
state
briefly
and
then
return
to
in
more
detail.
first,
a
state's
power
to
tax
a
nondomiciliary
taxpayer
depends
on
the
benefits
and
protections
that
the
state
provides
to
the
taxpayer's
activities
in
the
state.
second,
over
100
years
of
precedent
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
there
must
be
some
connection
beyond
mere
ownership
between
the
in-state
activities
of
the
corporation
and
its
out-of-state
activities
before
the
state
can
take
account
of
those
out-of-state
activities
in
determining
the
in-state
tax
liability.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
white,
in
terms
of
state
tax
jurisdiction
there
clearly
are
two
theories
on
which
jurisdiction
can
be
based,
one
with
regard
to
nondomiciliary
taxpayers
is
source.
another
theory,
which
is
a
well-established
theory
in
the
tax
jurisdiction,
is
residency,
and
there
is
no
question
that
a
state
of
residence
or
domicile
does
have
power
to
tax
all
of
a
corporation--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
even
though
the
income
that
it
includes
within
the
gross
income
is
produced
by
activities
that
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
state.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
that...
your
honor,
the
reason
underlying
the
residence
principle
does
not
have
to
do
with
the
particular--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--your
honor,
that
is
a
well-established
principle--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
your
honor,
because
our
essential
position
in
this
case
is
that
when
you
have
a
nondomiciliary
that
has
no
connection
with
the
state
other
than
the
activities
that
is
engaged
in
there,
the
state
must
provide
benefits
and
protections
to
those
activities.
with
regard
to
a
resident
taxpayer,
whether
it's
an
individual
or
corporation,
while
in
principle
the
state
has
power
to
tax
all
of
the
income,
that
power
does
in
fact
yield
when
there
are
activities
in
other
states
that
are
taxable
by
other
states.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that's
correct,
justice
white--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--that
is
right,
because
there
has
to
be
an
organic
connection
between
the
activities
of
a
nondomiciliary
taxpayer
and
its
activities
outside
the
state
in
order
for
the
state
to
look
outside.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
yes,
justice
white,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
that
underlies,
for
example,
the
basic
scheme
in
which
the
united
states
taxes--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--justice
white,
there
is
more
than
a
theory,
there
is
a
practice
going
back
100
years,
the
very
basis,
for
example,
that
the
united
states
taxes
all
domestic
corporations
on
income
it
earns
in
france
or
germany,
or
wherever,
is
based
on
the
notion
that
a
domestic...
a
domiciliary
corporation
may
be
taxed
on
all
of
its
income.
what
is
it
that
gives
the
state
the
power,
for
example,
to
tax
an
individual
on
all
of
his
income
wherever
its
earned?
it's
the
same
residence-based
principle,
which
is
as
well-established
as
the
source-based
principle.
however,
when
we
have
states
seeking
to
tax
the
same
income,
it's
quite
clear
when
there's
an
intersection
between
those
two
principles,
then
it
is
the
source
state
that
generally
may
prevail
over
the
residence
state,
because
to
allow
both
states
to
tax
would
violate
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
o'connor,
we
have
never
taken
issue
with
the
proposition
that
there
may
be
apportionable
income,
other
than
income
that
is
related
by
a
unitary
relationship
between
the
underlying
payor
and
payee.
for
example--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
language,
you
know,
in
asarco
which
if
read
literally
and
applied
to
facts
that
were
not
at
issue
in
asarco
might
well
exclude,
for
example,
income
of
a
foreign
products
nature
or
working
capital.
we
have
certainly
not
taken
issue
with
the
notion
that
investments
that
are
integrally
related
to
the
taxpayer's
operations
in
the
state,
organically
related...
capital
that
flows
in
and
out
of
the
business,
that
certainly
wouldn't
be
apportionable,
but
there
is
no
reason,
as
new
jersey
suggests
here,
because
of
this
doctrinal
foot
fault,
if
that's
what
it
was
in
asarco--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--we
fully
agree
with
that,
and
indeed--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
only
connection
here
is
the
very
type
of
connection
that
this
court
has
described
as
attenuated,
not
organic,
that
connects
every
business
that's
under
a
single,
corporate
shell.
for
example,
if--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
in
that
situation,
for
example,
suppose
that
bendix
had
earned
income
from
aerospace
operations
in
new
jersey.
now,
bendix
takes
that
income
which
is
taxed
by
new
jersey,
and
now
it
invests
in
some
other
asset
having
nothing
to
do
with
new
jersey...
a
yak
farm
in
outer
mongolia...
and
then
it
sells
the
yak
farm
and
it
buys
a
hula
hoop
factory
in
south
korea.
new
jersey,
i
suppose,
still
has
some
attenuated
connection
to
the
original
dollar
that
might
have
been
earned
in
new
jersey,
and
sometime
in
the
21st
century
might
well
be
reinvested
in
new
jersey,
but
until
that
income
has
that
connection
with
new
jersey,
even
if
it
had
some
historical
connection
with
new
jersey
or
may
be
poised
to
be
reinvested
in
new
jersey,
to
use
the
phraseology
of
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
here,
new
jersey
does
not
have
that
organic
connection
with
that
income
to
tax
it,
unless
you
want
to
fully
abandon
the
notion
which
has
underlay
this
court's
decision
for
over
100
years--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--justice
kennedy,
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
value
that
the
court
said
was
so
attenuated
that
it
could
not
be
included
in
the
apportionable
tax
base
in
cases
like
fargo
v.
hart.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
that's...
justice
kennedy,
it's
certainly
correct
that
in
that
attenuated
sense,
you
have
a
connection.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
in
fargo
v.
hart,
for
example,
there
were
bonds
worth
15.5
million
that
the
court
recognized
in
some
sense
added
to
the
creditworthiness
of
american
express
in
indiana,
but
justice
holmes
said
that
was
not
sufficient.
in
other
words,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
wealth
in
the
corporation,
there
was
money
that
adds
to
the
riches
of
the
corporation,
does
not
give
the
state
the
concrete
connection
that
it
needs
where
it
is
not
a
domiciliary
state
to
tax
the
income
of
an
out-of-state
corporation.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
the
consequences...
the
consequences
of
abandoning
the
notion
that
there
must,
in
fact,
be
a
concrete,
organic
connection
between
what
goes
on
within
the
state
and
what
goes
on
without
the
state,
because
under
this
analysis
everything,
of
course,
becomes
apportionable,
you
then
have
the
consequence
of
throwing
everything
into
the
tax
base
regardless
of
whether
it
might
have
been
unitary
or
not
under
prior
law,
and
having
significant
misattributions
of
income.
for
example,
suppose
we
have...
to
go
back
to
the
example
we
had
in
the
original
argument
of
this
case,
you
have
a
series
of
beauty
parlors
in
new
jersey,
wholly
unrelated
parking
lots
in
california.
now,
in
some
general
sense
the
parking
lots
are
adding
to
the
wealth
of
the
business.
there's
a
connection
there.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
if
the
corporation
goes
to
a
third-party
banking
institution
and
borrows
based
on
its
overall
wealth,
it
might
well
make
a
difference
to
the
bank
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
willing
to
make
the
loan,
but
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
overall
attenuated
notion
that
has
never
been
the
basis
for
allowing
states
to
tax
income.
we're
talking
now
about
income
from
activity
such
as
the
parking
lot,
or
the
investment,
which
itself
is
not
generated
by
any
activities
in
the
taxing
state.
in
other
words,
to
go
into
this
parking
lot
example,
what
protections
or
benefits
has
new
jersey
provided
to
the
parking
lots
in
california
that
would
allow
it
to
tax
that
income?
the
court
has
always
said
there
must
be
some
connection.
now,
you've
suggested
a
loan.
clearly,
if
there
were
interconnections
between
the
parking
lot
and
the
beauty
parlors
that
might
well
justify
looking
to
the
entire
unitary
business,
but
once
you
say
that
any
time
anything
is
under
a
single
corporate
entity
and
in
some
general
sense
may
add
to
the
wealth
of
the
corporation,
this
is
simply
abandoning
the
underlying
notions
that
justify
a
portion
of
it
in
the
first
place.
why
do
we...
one
thing,
why
is
it
the
states
have
been
allowed
to
look
outside
the
state?
we
start
with
a
notion
that
states
are
confined
territorially
in
their
tax
power.
now,
the
original
notion
was,
going
back
to
the
earlier
cases,
there
must
be
some
organic
connection
because
as
a
limited
exception
to
the
principle
that
states
may
only
tax
within
the
state
when
in
fact
there's
a
connection
between
what
goes
on
within
the
state
and
what
goes
on
outside
the
state,
then
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
the
value
of
what's
in
the
state,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
look
outside
the
state.
then
the
court
said
of
course,
in
cases
like
wallace
v.
hines
and
fargo
v.
hart,
and
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
when
you're
looking
outside
the
state
you
may
not
sweep
into
that
tax
base
these
unrelated
assets.
you
can't
sweep
in
these
bonds,
you
can't
sweep
in
the
parking
lot
or
the
yak
farm,
or
whatever
it
might
be.
now
new
jersey
says,
oh,
this
is
all
so
difficult.
we
can't
distinguish.
there
are
these
flows
going
back
and
forth.
in
effect,
new
jersey
is...
would
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
them.
the
first...
the
only
reason
new
jersey
could
look
outside
in
the
first
place
was
because
of
this
organic
connection.
now
new
jersey
says,
let's
abandon
any
notion
of
organic
connection.
let's
just
sweep
it
all
in
when
it's
too
difficult.
now,
wholly
apart
from
the
theoretical
flaws
in
new
jersey's
approach,
the
practical
consequences
of
adopting
new
jersey's
scheme,
they're
absolutely
astounding
when
you
think
about
the
existing
structure
that's
grown
up
around
this
court's
understanding
of
the
limits
on
state
taxation.
over
30
state
laws
are
based
on
the
very
distinction
that
underlies
the
unitary
business
principle,
namely
identifying
income
that's
organically
connected
and
is
therefore
apportionable
because
of
its
link,
and
income
which
is
nonbusiness,
which
is
not
included.
all
of
these...
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
notion
that
new
jersey
has
advanced
here
that
everything
gets
swept
in
simply
because
it's
within
the
corporation
and
has
some
attenuated
connection,
you
have
in
effect
invalidated
the
laws
of
30
states.
why?
because
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
taxation
by
allocation...
that
is,
sending
all
of
the
value
to
a
single
state
and
taxation
by
apportionment,
allowing
all
the
states
to
allow
a
piece
of
it,
is
theoretically
incommensurate.
it
would
lead
to
inevitable
multiple
taxation.
if
new
jersey,
for
example,
can
tax
the
gain
from
raw
land
that
this
hypothetical
corporation
has
in
florida,
or
from
investment
in
an
unrelated
metal
mines
corporation,
new
jersey
gets
an
apportioned
share
of
that.
at
the
same
time,
under
the
existing
states'
regimes,
florida
would
tax
100
percent
of
it.
well,
because
it's
raw
land
in
florida.
it's
got
a
connection.
it's
nonbusiness,
allocable
income.
who
would
get
the
gain
from
the
metal
minings
company
would
be
whatever
the
commercial
domicile
was
under
the
principle
that
a
commercial
domicile
has
in
effect
the
residuary
power.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
as
a
result
of
that
combined
with
new
jersey's
alleged
power
to
tax
an
apportioned
share--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--you're
talking
about
the
gain
now.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
i
was
assuming
that
you
had
land
in
florida
and
that
the
land
was
sold
at
a
gain.
now,
florida
would
clearly
tax
100
percent
of
that
gain
because
this
was
land
unrelated
to
any
business
of
the
corporation
and
therefore
would
be
regarded
by
florida
as
nonbusiness
income
taxable
in
full
in
florida.
at
the
same
time,
new
jersey,
simply
because
this
land
was
held
by
the
same
corporation
under
a
single
corporation
that
owned
beauty
parlors
in
new
jersey,
they
would
say
this
is
part
of
the
business,
we
can
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
that
income.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
they
would
put
it--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--they
would
put
it
in
the
apportionable
tax
base.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
it
would
lead
to
multiple
taxation,
because
the
same
income...
the
same
income
has
already
been
taxed
in
florida.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
cases
such
as
standard
oil
v.
peck
and
as
recently
as
mobil
that
the
intersection
of
a
regime
of
allocation,
let
us
say
100
percent
of
the
tax
base
were
to
again
go
into
one
state,
then
that
collides
with
a
regime
of
apportionment,
that
the
two
cannot
coexist.
one
must
yield,
and
in
general
what
the
court
has
indicated
in
that
situation
is
that
the
state
that
must
yield
is
the
state
of--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
sale
of
an
isolated
piece
of
land,
we're
talking
about
the
sale,
for
example,
of
all
stocks,
bonds,
all
the
capital
gains
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
incidentally
would
not
find
any
reflection
in
the
factors
underlying
new
jersey's
apportionment
scheme.
that
is,
what
new
jersey
wants
to
do...
take
this
case.
there
is
$56
million
of
apportionable
tax
base.
that
was
the
pie
we
started
with.
new
jersey
says,
well,
because
there's
some
connection
between
what's
going
on
in
new
jersey
and
this
asarco
gain,
we
want
to
increase
the
tax
base
by
$211
million,
and
how
do
we...
what
do
we
do
about
that?
do
we
make
any
adjustment
in
the
factors...
well,
we'll
put
the
receipts...
we'll
let
the
receipts
be...
not
even
the
receipts,
but
capital
gain,
go
into
the
numerator
of
the
receipts
factor
which
is
measured
in
the
billions,
so
there's
virtually
no
effect
on
the
amount,
of
the
share
of
the
pie.
all
that's
happened
is
that
the
pie
has
expanded
enormously,
and
the
question--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
o'connor,
we
are
quite
satisfied
with
that
definition,
which
we
believe
actually
reflects
the
longstanding
dichotomy
that
this
court
has
drawn
between
apportionable
and
allocable
income.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
o'connor,
certainly,
as
the
constitution
has
been
understood
up
to
today,
the
understanding
is
very
clear
that
merely
because...
and
this
is
the
new
jersey
position
here...
merely
because
an
asset
or
income
is
earned
by
a
single
corporation
that
happens
to
be
doing
business
in
the
state,
it's
absolutely
clear
that
that
does
not
constitute
a
sufficient
connection.
now
you're
asking
the
question
whether
or
not
the
uditpa
definition
is
one,
if
stretched
a
bit,
would
be
satisfactory.
well,
i
think
the
court
gave
the
right
answer
in
asarco
when
it
said
the
stretching
of
this
to
the
point
of
oblivion,
where
you
simply
look
at
the
corporate
purpose,
is
unsatisfactory.
we
concede,
and
we
are...
let's
say
we're
sympathetic
to
certain
aspects
of
your
dissent
in
the
asarco
opinion
with
regard
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
it
could
well
have
been
that
the
flows
of
value
between
asarco
and
southern
peru
should
have
justified
a
different
holding
on
the
facts,
but
not
the
basic
principle
which
you
yourself
acknowledge
in
that
decision,
namely
that
there's
got
to
be
a
unitary
business,
the
linchpin
of
apportionability.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
we
believe
that
uditpa
reflects
the
constitutional
rule.
when
you
say
not
a
step
further,
there
are...
there
may
be
some...
there
are
some
constructions
of
the
business
income
definition
that
have
gone
too
far,
may
have
gone
too
far...
this
court
has
struck
them
down...
but
certainly
not
only
the
definitions,
but
if
you
look
at
the
way
that
the
multi-state
tax
commission
that
administers
the
statute
that
is
in
force
in
30
states,
they
draw
the
very
same
lines.
they
talk
about
investments
that
are
part
of
the
business
and
investments
that
are
not
part
of
the
business,
long
term
investments
that
don't
relate
to
the
current
operations,
allocable
businesses--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
justice
o'connor.
under
uditpa
the
line
is
drawn,
regardless
of
whether
the
income
is
tangible
or
intangible,
as
to
whether
it
is
apportionable.
so,
for
example,
if
it
were
working
capital,
we
would
concede
that
under
the
uniform
act
it
quite
clearly
would
be
apportionable.
that
goes
into
the
tax
base
of
all
the
states
in
which
there's
a
business.
now
take
income
that
clearly
is
not
apportionable
under
uditpa.
for
example,
in
our
judgment
an
investment
in
an
unrelated
metal
mining
company,
20
percent
investment.
what
happens
then?
that
is
then
nonbusiness
income.
it
doesn't
go
in
any
state's
apportionment
factor.
it
simply
is...
it
goes
to
the
commercial
domicile
under
the
well-established
principle
that
the
state
of
residence
has
the
power
to
tax
all
the
resident's
or
domiciliary's
income
until...
unless
and
until
it
collides
with
some
other
state's
power
on
a
source
basis.
new
jersey
simply
has
no
source-based
power
to
get
at
this
income.
it's
not
that
it's
in
any
sense
fairer
to
send
to
the
domicile.
there
has
to
be
the
connection.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
kennedy,
it
could
be
either.
that
is,
the
principle
concern
is
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
new
jersey's
everything
is
apportionable
regime
and
not
indicate
the
same
point,
that
states
could
allocate
what
under
their
statute
is
plainly
nonbusiness
income,
then
one
of
those
must
yield
in
order
to
avoid
multiple
taxation.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
would
depend
on
which
state
would
have
to
yield,
i
would
assume,
looking,
for
example,
at
mobil,
where
the
court
saw
this
problem.
vermont
wanted
an
apportioned
share
of
the
income,
allegedly
new
york
had
the
power
to
tax
it
all.
the
court
said
no,
new
york
can't
tax
it
all.
so
what
would
happen
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
new
jersey's
regime
and
would
at
the
same
time
adhere
to
the
notion
that
this
kind
of
multiple
taxation
was
inappropriate,
it
would
render
all
of
the
domiciliary
states'
nonbusiness
income
apportionable.
that
is,
it
would
say
you
couldn't
allocate
this
any
more.
it
would
say
that
was
no
longer
the
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well...
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
was
going
to
talk
about
the
chaos
that
i
think
the
adoption
of
the--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--thank
you
very
much.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
i
would
like
to
make
three
points
and
given
my
experience
in
the
first
25
minutes,
i
had
better
make
my
first
two
fast.
ms.
hamill
seems
to
ignore
the
commerce
clause,
that
is,
ignore
the
problem,
or
i
guess
acknowledge
that
there
simply
will
be
multiple
taxation.
this
is
simply
a
fact
of
life.
well,
it
may
be
a
fact
of
life
that
new
jersey
is
willing
to
live
with,
but
it
is
certainly
a
fact
of
life
that
the
court
has
not
permitted,
that
is
terribly
destructive
to
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause,
namely
to
prevent
multiple
taxation.
and
indeed,
her
suggestion
that
because
there
is
an
exclusion
for
dividends,
that
this
is
a
nonproblem,
fails
to
recognize
the
fact
that
in
this
very
case
we
are
dealing
with
capital
gains;
fails
to
recognize
the
fact
that
under
her
regime
it
is
not
just
intangibles
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
all
income.
income
from
sales
of
tangibles,
it
doesn't
matter,
it
all
goes
into
the
tax
base,
and
therefore
there
is
going
to
be
multiple
taxation
resulting
from
the
continuing
existence
of
the
30-odd
states
that
have
the
business/nonbusiness
income
distinction
and
states
like
new
jersey.
second,
the
30
years
that
we
have
been
living
with
uditpa
in
which
in
fact
the
states
have
worked
out
these
relatively
workable
rules,
indeed,
ms.
hamill
has
conceded,
at
least
for
some
purposes,
that
asarco
and
woolworth
are
workable.
she
says
they
are
workable,
at
least
they
are
workable
for
the
34
other
states
that
don't
want
to
do
what
new
jersey
does.
she
wants
to
leave
intact
a
system
in
which
the
preexisting
unitary
business
principle
exists
for
34
states
but
not
for
new
jersey.
what
will
that
mean?
think
of
the
kinds
of
substance
versus
form
problems
you
would
have.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
situation,
going
back
to
our
parking
lot,
the
parking
lot
is
in
california.
the
beauty
parlor
is
in
new
jersey.
under
her
regime,
if
you
put
the
parking
lot
into
a
separate
subsidiary,
new
jersey
cannot
tax
it.
why?
because
there
is
no
unitary
connection
under
traditional
principles.
now
suppose
you
take
that
parking
lot,
you
dissolve
it
into
the
beauty
parlor
corporation.
now
miraculously,
new
jersey's
power
to
tax
expands.
the
constitution
does
not
permit
this
kind
of
form
over
substance
result.
it
is
simply
indefensible.
the
notion
that...
with
respect
to
the
retroactivity
point,
that
allied
may
not
have
relied
on
this
case
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
asarco
and
woolworth
should
be
overruled,
whether
or
not
it
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
prospectively.
under
the
chevron
test
it
is
quite
clear,
from
justice
souter's
opinion
in
which
the
court
joined
in
the
judgment
that
selective
prospectivity
is
unacceptable,
and
clearly
this
court
cannot
decide
this
case
on
a
retroactive,
prospective
basis
based
on
whether
or
not
a
particular
taxpayer
relied.
it
is
obviously
whether
the
taxpayers
in
general
have
relied
on
asarco
and
woolworth
and
to
suggest
that
this
establishes,
that
this
does
not
establish
a
new
principle
of
law
and
that
somehow
we
were
to
glean
from
container,
which
actually
reaffirmed,
spoke
favorably
of
asarco
and
woolworth,
that
it
was
becoming
eroded
or
discredited
is
simply
contrary
to
common
sense.
new
jersey
also
completely
fails
to
appreciate
the
complexity
and
chaos
that
will
result
from
her
approach.
the
problem
of
having
the
tax
base
be
congruent
to
the
underlying
apportionment
factors
is
serious
enough
without
the
complication
of
sweeping
wholly
unrelated
assets
and
wholly
unrelated
businesses
into
a
single
apportionable
tax
base.
under
new
jersey's
regime,
new
jersey
would
retain
the
same
three-factor
formula
regardless
of
the
differences
of
the
businesses.
you
could
have,
for
example,
an
advertising
business
and
a
steel
business
under
the
same
corporate
roof,
steel
business,
capital
intensive,
all
of
its
property
based
in
the
steel
mills
would
outweigh
the
advertising
business,
which
was
generated
largely
by
payroll,
say,
in
new
york.
the
result
would
be
complete
misattribution
of
income
without
a
serious
look
at
what
the
underlying
factors
of
the
apportionment
formula
provided.
this
would
require
the
court
to
become
embroiled
in
the
very
controversies
that
presumably
it
thought
it
was
getting
out
of
over
the
last
10
years
in
developing
these
workable
principles.
asarco
goes
back
100
years,
and
not
on
a
discredited
basis.
the
unitary
business
principle
has
been
there
for
100
years,
has
involved
intangible
property.
there
was
no
issue
in
fargo
v.
hart
as
to
the
particular
tangible
property.
it
was
because
intangibles
were--
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
essential
question
now
before
this
court
is
whether
there
must
exist
some
connection
beyond
the
mere
jurisdictional
presence
of
the
corporation
in
a
state
in
order
for
a
state
to
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
all
of
that
corporation's
income.
in
other
words,
must
a
state
have
some
connection
with
the
activities
of
produced
income
in
order
to
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
it?
we
believe
the
answer
to
this
question
is
yes
for
three
reasons
that
i'd
like
to
state
briefly
and
then
return
to
in
more
detail.
first,
a
state's
power
to
tax
a
nondomiciliary
taxpayer
depends
on
the
benefits
and
protections
that
the
state
provides
to
the
taxpayer's
activities
in
the
state.
second,
over
100
years
of
precedent
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
there
must
be
some
connection
beyond
mere
ownership
between
the
in-state
activities
of
the
corporation
and
its
out-of-state
activities
before
the
state
can
take
account
of
those
out-of-state
activities
in
determining
the
in-state
tax
liability.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
white,
in
terms
of
state
tax
jurisdiction
there
clearly
are
two
theories
on
which
jurisdiction
can
be
based,
one
with
regard
to
nondomiciliary
taxpayers
is
source.
another
theory,
which
is
a
well-established
theory
in
the
tax
jurisdiction,
is
residency,
and
there
is
no
question
that
a
state
of
residence
or
domicile
does
have
power
to
tax
all
of
a
corporation--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
that...
your
honor,
the
reason
underlying
the
residence
principle
does
not
have
to
do
with
the
particular--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--your
honor,
that
is
a
well-established
principle--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
your
honor,
because
our
essential
position
in
this
case
is
that
when
you
have
a
nondomiciliary
that
has
no
connection
with
the
state
other
than
the
activities
that
is
engaged
in
there,
the
state
must
provide
benefits
and
protections
to
those
activities.
with
regard
to
a
resident
taxpayer,
whether
it's
an
individual
or
corporation,
while
in
principle
the
state
has
power
to
tax
all
of
the
income,
that
power
does
in
fact
yield
when
there
are
activities
in
other
states
that
are
taxable
by
other
states.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that's
correct,
justice
white--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--that
is
right,
because
there
has
to
be
an
organic
connection
between
the
activities
of
a
nondomiciliary
taxpayer
and
its
activities
outside
the
state
in
order
for
the
state
to
look
outside.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
yes,
justice
white,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
that
underlies,
for
example,
the
basic
scheme
in
which
the
united
states
taxes--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--justice
white,
there
is
more
than
a
theory,
there
is
a
practice
going
back
100
years,
the
very
basis,
for
example,
that
the
united
states
taxes
all
domestic
corporations
on
income
it
earns
in
france
or
germany,
or
wherever,
is
based
on
the
notion
that
a
domestic...
a
domiciliary
corporation
may
be
taxed
on
all
of
its
income.
what
is
it
that
gives
the
state
the
power,
for
example,
to
tax
an
individual
on
all
of
his
income
wherever
its
earned?
it's
the
same
residence-based
principle,
which
is
as
well-established
as
the
source-based
principle.
however,
when
we
have
states
seeking
to
tax
the
same
income,
it's
quite
clear
when
there's
an
intersection
between
those
two
principles,
then
it
is
the
source
state
that
generally
may
prevail
over
the
residence
state,
because
to
allow
both
states
to
tax
would
violate
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
o'connor,
we
have
never
taken
issue
with
the
proposition
that
there
may
be
apportionable
income,
other
than
income
that
is
related
by
a
unitary
relationship
between
the
underlying
payor
and
payee.
for
example--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
language,
you
know,
in
asarco
which
if
read
literally
and
applied
to
facts
that
were
not
at
issue
in
asarco
might
well
exclude,
for
example,
income
of
a
foreign
products
nature
or
working
capital.
we
have
certainly
not
taken
issue
with
the
notion
that
investments
that
are
integrally
related
to
the
taxpayer's
operations
in
the
state,
organically
related...
capital
that
flows
in
and
out
of
the
business,
that
certainly
wouldn't
be
apportionable,
but
there
is
no
reason,
as
new
jersey
suggests
here,
because
of
this
doctrinal
foot
fault,
if
that's
what
it
was
in
asarco--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--we
fully
agree
with
that,
and
indeed--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
only
connection
here
is
the
very
type
of
connection
that
this
court
has
described
as
attenuated,
not
organic,
that
connects
every
business
that's
under
a
single,
corporate
shell.
for
example,
if--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
in
that
situation,
for
example,
suppose
that
bendix
had
earned
income
from
aerospace
operations
in
new
jersey.
now,
bendix
takes
that
income
which
is
taxed
by
new
jersey,
and
now
it
invests
in
some
other
asset
having
nothing
to
do
with
new
jersey...
a
yak
farm
in
outer
mongolia...
and
then
it
sells
the
yak
farm
and
it
buys
a
hula
hoop
factory
in
south
korea.
new
jersey,
i
suppose,
still
has
some
attenuated
connection
to
the
original
dollar
that
might
have
been
earned
in
new
jersey,
and
sometime
in
the
21st
century
might
well
be
reinvested
in
new
jersey,
but
until
that
income
has
that
connection
with
new
jersey,
even
if
it
had
some
historical
connection
with
new
jersey
or
may
be
poised
to
be
reinvested
in
new
jersey,
to
use
the
phraseology
of
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
here,
new
jersey
does
not
have
that
organic
connection
with
that
income
to
tax
it,
unless
you
want
to
fully
abandon
the
notion
which
has
underlay
this
court's
decision
for
over
100
years--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--justice
kennedy,
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
value
that
the
court
said
was
so
attenuated
that
it
could
not
be
included
in
the
apportionable
tax
base
in
cases
like
fargo
v.
hart.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
that's...
justice
kennedy,
it's
certainly
correct
that
in
that
attenuated
sense,
you
have
a
connection.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
in
fargo
v.
hart,
for
example,
there
were
bonds
worth
15.5
million
that
the
court
recognized
in
some
sense
added
to
the
creditworthiness
of
american
express
in
indiana,
but
justice
holmes
said
that
was
not
sufficient.
in
other
words,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
wealth
in
the
corporation,
there
was
money
that
adds
to
the
riches
of
the
corporation,
does
not
give
the
state
the
concrete
connection
that
it
needs
where
it
is
not
a
domiciliary
state
to
tax
the
income
of
an
out-of-state
corporation.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
the
consequences...
the
consequences
of
abandoning
the
notion
that
there
must,
in
fact,
be
a
concrete,
organic
connection
between
what
goes
on
within
the
state
and
what
goes
on
without
the
state,
because
under
this
analysis
everything,
of
course,
becomes
apportionable,
you
then
have
the
consequence
of
throwing
everything
into
the
tax
base
regardless
of
whether
it
might
have
been
unitary
or
not
under
prior
law,
and
having
significant
misattributions
of
income.
for
example,
suppose
we
have...
to
go
back
to
the
example
we
had
in
the
original
argument
of
this
case,
you
have
a
series
of
beauty
parlors
in
new
jersey,
wholly
unrelated
parking
lots
in
california.
now,
in
some
general
sense
the
parking
lots
are
adding
to
the
wealth
of
the
business.
there's
a
connection
there.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
if
the
corporation
goes
to
a
third-party
banking
institution
and
borrows
based
on
its
overall
wealth,
it
might
well
make
a
difference
to
the
bank
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
willing
to
make
the
loan,
but
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
overall
attenuated
notion
that
has
never
been
the
basis
for
allowing
states
to
tax
income.
we're
talking
now
about
income
from
activity
such
as
the
parking
lot,
or
the
investment,
which
itself
is
not
generated
by
any
activities
in
the
taxing
state.
in
other
words,
to
go
into
this
parking
lot
example,
what
protections
or
benefits
has
new
jersey
provided
to
the
parking
lots
in
california
that
would
allow
it
to
tax
that
income?
the
court
has
always
said
there
must
be
some
connection.
now,
you've
suggested
a
loan.
clearly,
if
there
were
interconnections
between
the
parking
lot
and
the
beauty
parlors
that
might
well
justify
looking
to
the
entire
unitary
business,
but
once
you
say
that
any
time
anything
is
under
a
single
corporate
entity
and
in
some
general
sense
may
add
to
the
wealth
of
the
corporation,
this
is
simply
abandoning
the
underlying
notions
that
justify
a
portion
of
it
in
the
first
place.
why
do
we...
one
thing,
why
is
it
the
states
have
been
allowed
to
look
outside
the
state?
we
start
with
a
notion
that
states
are
confined
territorially
in
their
tax
power.
now,
the
original
notion
was,
going
back
to
the
earlier
cases,
there
must
be
some
organic
connection
because
as
a
limited
exception
to
the
principle
that
states
may
only
tax
within
the
state
when
in
fact
there's
a
connection
between
what
goes
on
within
the
state
and
what
goes
on
outside
the
state,
then
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
the
value
of
what's
in
the
state,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
look
outside
the
state.
then
the
court
said
of
course,
in
cases
like
wallace
v.
hines
and
fargo
v.
hart,
and
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
when
you're
looking
outside
the
state
you
may
not
sweep
into
that
tax
base
these
unrelated
assets.
you
can't
sweep
in
these
bonds,
you
can't
sweep
in
the
parking
lot
or
the
yak
farm,
or
whatever
it
might
be.
now
new
jersey
says,
oh,
this
is
all
so
difficult.
we
can't
distinguish.
there
are
these
flows
going
back
and
forth.
in
effect,
new
jersey
is...
would
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
them.
the
first...
the
only
reason
new
jersey
could
look
outside
in
the
first
place
was
because
of
this
organic
connection.
now
new
jersey
says,
let's
abandon
any
notion
of
organic
connection.
let's
just
sweep
it
all
in
when
it's
too
difficult.
now,
wholly
apart
from
the
theoretical
flaws
in
new
jersey's
approach,
the
practical
consequences
of
adopting
new
jersey's
scheme,
they're
absolutely
astounding
when
you
think
about
the
existing
structure
that's
grown
up
around
this
court's
understanding
of
the
limits
on
state
taxation.
over
30
state
laws
are
based
on
the
very
distinction
that
underlies
the
unitary
business
principle,
namely
identifying
income
that's
organically
connected
and
is
therefore
apportionable
because
of
its
link,
and
income
which
is
nonbusiness,
which
is
not
included.
all
of
these...
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
notion
that
new
jersey
has
advanced
here
that
everything
gets
swept
in
simply
because
it's
within
the
corporation
and
has
some
attenuated
connection,
you
have
in
effect
invalidated
the
laws
of
30
states.
why?
because
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
taxation
by
allocation...
that
is,
sending
all
of
the
value
to
a
single
state
and
taxation
by
apportionment,
allowing
all
the
states
to
allow
a
piece
of
it,
is
theoretically
incommensurate.
it
would
lead
to
inevitable
multiple
taxation.
if
new
jersey,
for
example,
can
tax
the
gain
from
raw
land
that
this
hypothetical
corporation
has
in
florida,
or
from
investment
in
an
unrelated
metal
mines
corporation,
new
jersey
gets
an
apportioned
share
of
that.
at
the
same
time,
under
the
existing
states'
regimes,
florida
would
tax
100
percent
of
it.
well,
because
it's
raw
land
in
florida.
it's
got
a
connection.
it's
nonbusiness,
allocable
income.
who
would
get
the
gain
from
the
metal
minings
company
would
be
whatever
the
commercial
domicile
was
under
the
principle
that
a
commercial
domicile
has
in
effect
the
residuary
power.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
as
a
result
of
that
combined
with
new
jersey's
alleged
power
to
tax
an
apportioned
share--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--you're
talking
about
the
gain
now.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
i
was
assuming
that
you
had
land
in
florida
and
that
the
land
was
sold
at
a
gain.
now,
florida
would
clearly
tax
100
percent
of
that
gain
because
this
was
land
unrelated
to
any
business
of
the
corporation
and
therefore
would
be
regarded
by
florida
as
nonbusiness
income
taxable
in
full
in
florida.
at
the
same
time,
new
jersey,
simply
because
this
land
was
held
by
the
same
corporation
under
a
single
corporation
that
owned
beauty
parlors
in
new
jersey,
they
would
say
this
is
part
of
the
business,
we
can
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
that
income.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
they
would
put
it--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--they
would
put
it
in
the
apportionable
tax
base.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
it
would
lead
to
multiple
taxation,
because
the
same
income...
the
same
income
has
already
been
taxed
in
florida.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
cases
such
as
standard
oil
v.
peck
and
as
recently
as
mobil
that
the
intersection
of
a
regime
of
allocation,
let
us
say
100
percent
of
the
tax
base
were
to
again
go
into
one
state,
then
that
collides
with
a
regime
of
apportionment,
that
the
two
cannot
coexist.
one
must
yield,
and
in
general
what
the
court
has
indicated
in
that
situation
is
that
the
state
that
must
yield
is
the
state
of--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
sale
of
an
isolated
piece
of
land,
we're
talking
about
the
sale,
for
example,
of
all
stocks,
bonds,
all
the
capital
gains
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
incidentally
would
not
find
any
reflection
in
the
factors
underlying
new
jersey's
apportionment
scheme.
that
is,
what
new
jersey
wants
to
do...
take
this
case.
there
is
$56
million
of
apportionable
tax
base.
that
was
the
pie
we
started
with.
new
jersey
says,
well,
because
there's
some
connection
between
what's
going
on
in
new
jersey
and
this
asarco
gain,
we
want
to
increase
the
tax
base
by
$211
million,
and
how
do
we...
what
do
we
do
about
that?
do
we
make
any
adjustment
in
the
factors...
well,
we'll
put
the
receipts...
we'll
let
the
receipts
be...
not
even
the
receipts,
but
capital
gain,
go
into
the
numerator
of
the
receipts
factor
which
is
measured
in
the
billions,
so
there's
virtually
no
effect
on
the
amount,
of
the
share
of
the
pie.
all
that's
happened
is
that
the
pie
has
expanded
enormously,
and
the
question--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--yes,
justice.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
o'connor,
we
are
quite
satisfied
with
that
definition,
which
we
believe
actually
reflects
the
longstanding
dichotomy
that
this
court
has
drawn
between
apportionable
and
allocable
income.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
o'connor,
certainly,
as
the
constitution
has
been
understood
up
to
today,
the
understanding
is
very
clear
that
merely
because...
and
this
is
the
new
jersey
position
here...
merely
because
an
asset
or
income
is
earned
by
a
single
corporation
that
happens
to
be
doing
business
in
the
state,
it's
absolutely
clear
that
that
does
not
constitute
a
sufficient
connection.
now
you're
asking
the
question
whether
or
not
the
uditpa
definition
is
one,
if
stretched
a
bit,
would
be
satisfactory.
well,
i
think
the
court
gave
the
right
answer
in
asarco
when
it
said
the
stretching
of
this
to
the
point
of
oblivion,
where
you
simply
look
at
the
corporate
purpose,
is
unsatisfactory.
we
concede,
and
we
are...
let's
say
we're
sympathetic
to
certain
aspects
of
your
dissent
in
the
asarco
opinion
with
regard
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
it
could
well
have
been
that
the
flows
of
value
between
asarco
and
southern
peru
should
have
justified
a
different
holding
on
the
facts,
but
not
the
basic
principle
which
you
yourself
acknowledge
in
that
decision,
namely
that
there's
got
to
be
a
unitary
business,
the
linchpin
of
apportionability.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
we
believe
that
uditpa
reflects
the
constitutional
rule.
when
you
say
not
a
step
further,
there
are...
there
may
be
some...
there
are
some
constructions
of
the
business
income
definition
that
have
gone
too
far,
may
have
gone
too
far...
this
court
has
struck
them
down...
but
certainly
not
only
the
definitions,
but
if
you
look
at
the
way
that
the
multi-state
tax
commission
that
administers
the
statute
that
is
in
force
in
30
states,
they
draw
the
very
same
lines.
they
talk
about
investments
that
are
part
of
the
business
and
investments
that
are
not
part
of
the
business,
long
term
investments
that
don't
relate
to
the
current
operations,
allocable
businesses--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--no,
justice
o'connor.
under
uditpa
the
line
is
drawn,
regardless
of
whether
the
income
is
tangible
or
intangible,
as
to
whether
it
is
apportionable.
so,
for
example,
if
it
were
working
capital,
we
would
concede
that
under
the
uniform
act
it
quite
clearly
would
be
apportionable.
that
goes
into
the
tax
base
of
all
the
states
in
which
there's
a
business.
now
take
income
that
clearly
is
not
apportionable
under
uditpa.
for
example,
in
our
judgment
an
investment
in
an
unrelated
metal
mining
company,
20
percent
investment.
what
happens
then?
that
is
then
nonbusiness
income.
it
doesn't
go
in
any
state's
apportionment
factor.
it
simply
is...
it
goes
to
the
commercial
domicile
under
the
well-established
principle
that
the
state
of
residence
has
the
power
to
tax
all
the
resident's
or
domiciliary's
income
until...
unless
and
until
it
collides
with
some
other
state's
power
on
a
source
basis.
new
jersey
simply
has
no
source-based
power
to
get
at
this
income.
it's
not
that
it's
in
any
sense
fairer
to
send
to
the
domicile.
there
has
to
be
the
connection.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
justice
kennedy,
it
could
be
either.
that
is,
the
principle
concern
is
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
new
jersey's
everything
is
apportionable
regime
and
not
indicate
the
same
point,
that
states
could
allocate
what
under
their
statute
is
plainly
nonbusiness
income,
then
one
of
those
must
yield
in
order
to
avoid
multiple
taxation.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
would
depend
on
which
state
would
have
to
yield,
i
would
assume,
looking,
for
example,
at
mobil,
where
the
court
saw
this
problem.
vermont
wanted
an
apportioned
share
of
the
income,
allegedly
new
york
had
the
power
to
tax
it
all.
the
court
said
no,
new
york
can't
tax
it
all.
so
what
would
happen
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
new
jersey's
regime
and
would
at
the
same
time
adhere
to
the
notion
that
this
kind
of
multiple
taxation
was
inappropriate,
it
would
render
all
of
the
domiciliary
states'
nonbusiness
income
apportionable.
that
is,
it
would
say
you
couldn't
allocate
this
any
more.
it
would
say
that
was
no
longer
the
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--well...
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
was
going
to
talk
about
the
chaos
that
i
think
the
adoption
of
the--
mr.
walter
hellerstein
--thank
you
very
much.
mr.
walter
hellerstein
i
would
like
to
make
three
points
and
given
my
experience
in
the
first
25
minutes,
i
had
better
make
my
first
two
fast.
ms.
hamill
seems
to
ignore
the
commerce
clause,
that
is,
ignore
the
problem,
or
i
guess
acknowledge
that
there
simply
will
be
multiple
taxation.
this
is
simply
a
fact
of
life.
well,
it
may
be
a
fact
of
life
that
new
jersey
is
willing
to
live
with,
but
it
is
certainly
a
fact
of
life
that
the
court
has
not
permitted,
that
is
terribly
destructive
to
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause,
namely
to
prevent
multiple
taxation.
and
indeed,
her
suggestion
that
because
there
is
an
exclusion
for
dividends,
that
this
is
a
nonproblem,
fails
to
recognize
the
fact
that
in
this
very
case
we
are
dealing
with
capital
gains;
fails
to
recognize
the
fact
that
under
her
regime
it
is
not
just
intangibles
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
all
income.
income
from
sales
of
tangibles,
it
doesn't
matter,
it
all
goes
into
the
tax
base,
and
therefore
there
is
going
to
be
multiple
taxation
resulting
from
the
continuing
existence
of
the
30-odd
states
that
have
the
business/nonbusiness
income
distinction
and
states
like
new
jersey.
second,
the
30
years
that
we
have
been
living
with
uditpa
in
which
in
fact
the
states
have
worked
out
these
relatively
workable
rules,
indeed,
ms.
hamill
has
conceded,
at
least
for
some
purposes,
that
asarco
and
woolworth
are
workable.
she
says
they
are
workable,
at
least
they
are
workable
for
the
34
other
states
that
don't
want
to
do
what
new
jersey
does.
she
wants
to
leave
intact
a
system
in
which
the
preexisting
unitary
business
principle
exists
for
34
states
but
not
for
new
jersey.
what
will
that
mean?
think
of
the
kinds
of
substance
versus
form
problems
you
would
have.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
situation,
going
back
to
our
parking
lot,
the
parking
lot
is
in
california.
the
beauty
parlor
is
in
new
jersey.
under
her
regime,
if
you
put
the
parking
lot
into
a
separate
subsidiary,
new
jersey
cannot
tax
it.
why?
because
there
is
no
unitary
connection
under
traditional
principles.
now
suppose
you
take
that
parking
lot,
you
dissolve
it
into
the
beauty
parlor
corporation.
now
miraculously,
new
jersey's
power
to
tax
expands.
the
constitution
does
not
permit
this
kind
of
form
over
substance
result.
it
is
simply
indefensible.
the
notion
that...
with
respect
to
the
retroactivity
point,
that
allied
may
not
have
relied
on
this
case
is
simply
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
asarco
and
woolworth
should
be
overruled,
whether
or
not
it
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
prospectively.
under
the
chevron
test
it
is
quite
clear,
from
justice
souter's
opinion
in
which
the

joined

the
judgment
that
selective
prospectivity

unacceptable,

clearly
this
court
cannot
decide
this
case
on
a
retroactive,
prospective
basis
based
on
whether

relied.
it
is
obviously
whether
the
taxpayers
in
general
have
relied
on
asarco
and
woolworth
and
to
suggest
that
this
establishes,
that
this
does
not
establish
a
new
principle
of
law
and
that
somehow
we
were
to
glean
from
container,
which
actually
reaffirmed,
spoke
favorably
of
asarco
and
woolworth,
that
it
was
becoming
eroded
or
discredited

simply
contrary
to
common
sense.

completely
fails

the
complexity

chaos
that
will
result
from

approach.
the
problem
of
having
the
tax
base
be
congruent
to
the
underlying
apportionment
factors
is
serious
enough
without
the
complication
of
sweeping
wholly
unrelated
assets
and
wholly
unrelated
businesses
into
a
single
apportionable
tax
base.

new

would

the

three-factor
formula
regardless
of

you
could
have,
for
example,
an
advertising
business
and
a
steel
business
under
the

corporate
roof,
steel
business,
capital
intensive,
all
of
its
property
based
in
the
steel
mills
would
outweigh
the
advertising
business,
which
was
generated
largely
by

the
result
would
be
complete
misattribution

a
serious
look
at

the
underlying

of

this
