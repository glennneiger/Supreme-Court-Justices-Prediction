unknown
speaker
mr.--
--what
about
a...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
what
about
a
domestic
corporation
incorporated
in
the
taxing
state?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
mean
residence
just
gives
a
connection
no
matter
where
the
income
comes
from.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be,
but
the
kind
of
an
argument
you're
making
would
seem
to
challenge
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
a
nondomiciliary
corporation
that
is
doing
business
in
the
state
and
it's
a...
and
there's
no
question
that
the
state
can
tax
its
share
of
the
income
of
that
corporation
because
it's
doing
business
there.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
would
say
that
that
nondomiciliary's
corporation
income
from
activities
that
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
state,
like
investment
income--
unknown
speaker
--would
have...
the
state
could
not
include
it
in
gross
income.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
a
difference
between
a
domiciliary
corporation
and
a
corporation
that
is
not
domiciliary
but
it's
doing
business
in
the
state
and
is
taxable
there
on
its
activities.
unknown
speaker
you
mean...
what
you
mean
is
that
there's
a
theory,
there's
an
accepted
theory
that
you
can
tax
a
domiciliary
corporation
on
all
of
its
income.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hellerstein,
i
think
that
probably
asarco
put
forward
the
view
that
for
the
nondomiciliary
entity
to
be...
for
their
dividends
or
income
to
be
taxed
in
the
taxing
state
that
the
dividend
payor
has
to
be
unitary
with
the
payee.
something
more
is
required
under
asarco
than
just
a
flow
of
value
into
the
taxing
state
from
that
nondomestic
entity.
now,
do
you
think
that's
a
valid
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
there
certainly
is
language
in
asarco
that
would
say
just
that,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
so
there
has
to
be
some
flow
of
value
into
the
state,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
now,
if
you
agree
with
that,
can
you
say
there
is
no
such
value
that
flowed
in
here
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
purpose
of
the
investment
was
to
acquire
enough
capital
to
go
ahead
and
acquire
more
of
the
underlying
business
in
the
domestic
state?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
something
more
than
that?
maybe
it
isn't
the
hard-core
definition
of
working
capital,
but
it's
capital
for
a
longer
term
expansion,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
in
new
jersey
the
bendix
board
of
directors
meets
and
they
say
we
have
a
very
high-tech
speculative
research
project
we
want
to
conduct
in
new
jersey.
now,
the
only
reason
we're
willing
to
undertake
that
is
because
we
know
we
have
a
very
safe,
secure
investment
in
asarco.
there's
no
checks
flowing
back
and
forth,
but
isn't
there
a
value
there
that
the
company
relies
on?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
attenuated
in
the
real
sense?
isn't
the
example
i've
given
you,
the
example
of
a
very
real
business
kind
of
a
decision
and
a
business
kind
of
judgment,
and
isn't
this
the
way
a
business
is
properly
valued?
if
you
were
a
banker,
you'd
certainly
want
to
see
the
asarco
balance
sheet
before
you
lent
any
money
in
new
jersey,
if
you
thought
the
company
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that's
attenuated,
but
i
think
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
manufacturing
analogy
that
you're
relying
on
here
that
is
not
wholly
in
accord
with
the
way
many
modern
business
corporations
are
formulated
and
with
the
way
they
evaluate
their
own
assets.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
beauty
parlors
are
not
doing
well
and
they
borrow
money,
does
it
make
a
difference
to
taxation
whether
or
not
the
banker
looks
at
the
balance
sheet
to
see
that
the
parking
lots
are
in
the
balance
sheet?
unknown
speaker
well,
florida
can
surely
tax
the
real
estate
located
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
of
income.
unknown
speaker
a
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
they'd
put
it
in
the,
what,
the
numerator--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
denominator.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
very
general
way,
perhaps,
but
there's
no
terribly
fire-strict
prohibition
against
that
sort
of
multiple
taxation,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
true
as
a
generality,
but
i
mean
i
think
what
you've
just
pointed
out,
perhaps,
is
arguably
a
rather
small
exception
to
it.
you
know,
land
located
in
florida,
a
traditionally
absolutely
immobile
thing,
has
always
been
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state
where
it's
located,
and
a
tax
on
a
capital
gain
resulting
from
the
sale
of
that
land,
i'm
not
sure
that
would
come
under
the
head
of
double
taxation
if
new
jersey
also
just
seeks
to
tax
a
proportionate
share
of
the
income.
unknown
speaker
mr....
well,
go
ahead.
i
want
to
ask
a
question
when
you
have
a
moment.
unknown
speaker
more
than
half
the
states
have
adopted
something
called
the
uniform
division
of
income
for
tax
purposes
act,
called
uditpa,
and
under
uditpa,
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
say...
it
would
define
what
is
business
income,
and
it
would
say
that
business
income
is
taxable
by
the
state,
and
that
it
includes
income
from
intangibles
if
the
acquisition,
management,
and
disposition
of
the
property
constitute
integral
parts
of
the
taxpayer's
regular
trade
or
business
operation.
now,
do
you
think
that
is
valid,
a
valid
concept?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
constitution
allows
that
but
not
one
step
further
in
terms
of
defining
taxable
income?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
do
you
think
uditpa
is
as
far
as
the
constitution
will
allow,
not
a
step
further?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
under
uditpa?
the
domiciliary
state
can
tax
all
the
intangible
income,
and
yet
if
it
fits
under
uditpa's
formula
in
another
state,
that
other
state
can
have
some
apportion.
unknown
speaker
is
the
principle
concern
with
double
taxation
the
taxing
authority
of
the
domicile
state?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not...
if
the
state...
if
the
corporation
is
incorporated
in
the
state
of
illinois,
is
the
concern
that
illinois
will
cause
the
double
taxation,
or
is
the
concern
if
we
adopt
the
new
jersey
regime,
that
there
will
be
double
taxation
in
all
of
the
other
49
states,
or
in
some
of
the
other
49
states?
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
just
tell
me
what
the
third
point
you
were
going
to
make
was
when
you
started
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hellerstein.
ms.
hamill.
unknown
speaker
unitary
business
concept
is
just
out
of
the
picture
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
draw
a
line
where
it
is
in,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
if
you
do
that,
then
can
the
state,
where
the
subsidiary
is
resident,
so
to
speak,
can
it
tax
all
100
percent
of
the
income,
even
though
new
jersey
is
going
to
take
a
share
of
it
too?
unknown
speaker
the
dividends,
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
subsidiary
sure
does.
[laughter]
and
so
does
the
parent.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
is
business
income?
unknown
speaker
would
you
win
under
the
uditpa
definition
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
you
would
make
the
submission
that
uditpa
itself
is
an
unworkable
rule?
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
us
to
overrule
asarco.
[laughter]
what
is
the
constitutional
rule
that
you
replace
asarco
with
in
the
uditpa
states?
can
the
domiciliary
state
now
tax
so
that
you
can
have
two
states
taxing,
or
is
it
only
new
jersey,
the
nondomiciliary
states
that
can
apportion?
are
you
going
to
have
double
taxation--
unknown
speaker
--or
is
it
that
the
domiciliary
state
gets
frozen
out?
unknown
speaker
because
of
disagreements
of
opinion
of
what
kind
of
an
income
it
is.
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
assuming
everybody
agrees
what
kind
of
income
it
is.
unknown
speaker
can
they
both
tax
it
or
can
only
the
state,
the
allocating
state
tax
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
your
theory.
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
asking
you,
under
your
theory,
don't
put
it
on
me,
you
say
it
depends
on
what
you
think
the
basis
is.
what
do
you
think
the
basis
is?
unknown
speaker
they
can
both
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
shouldn't
encourage
it,
should
we,
at
least
if
we
follow
language
in
our
prior
opinions,
that
isn't
a
goal
to
be
achieved.
it
is
to
be
avoided.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about,
i
think
it
is
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
if
we
assume
a
business
that
has
its
major
operations
in
california,
have
a
whole
bunch
of
operations
there,
but
none
of
them
on
the
east
coast
and
all,
and
they
also
separately
buy
and
sell
a
parking
lot
in
florida
which
under
traditional
rules
would
not
have
been
considered
part
of
the
unitary
business.
it
would
be
considered
a
separate
transaction.
in
your
view,
could
florida
tax
the
entire
income
from
the
separate
transaction,
or
must
it
treat
it
as
part
of
a
unitary
business
in
the
same
corporate
shell?
unknown
speaker
could
have
an
option
to
do
it
either
way.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
that
would
be
constitutionally
wrong
is
it
would
lead
to
double
taxation
which--
unknown
speaker
--would
not
otherwise
occur
under
our
present
regime?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
wouldn't,
because
i
am
assuming,
my
hypothesis
is
that
it
is
not
a
unitary
business
under
present
rules.
unknown
speaker
see,
that
would
cause
a
change
which
would
increase
the
possibility
of
double
taxation.
unknown
speaker
yet,
yet.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
those
states
could
change
their
laws.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
your
hypothesis
holds,
uditpa
also
is
unworkable
and
i
think
that
should
be
stricken
down
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
rewriting
the
basic
formula
under
the
due
process
clause.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
unitarian
concepts
are,
for
the
most
part,
out
of
the
window?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
states
will
not
maximize
their
taxable
authority?
unknown
speaker
they
will
simply
have
to
be
reasonable;
even
if
they
weren't,
they
could
get
away
with
taxing
more.
unknown
speaker
that
will
be
our
principle,
you
can
tax
whatever
you
like,
but
don't
be
too
piggy.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that
will
put
the
fear
of
the
lord
in
them.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
decide
then
if
it
is
being
too
piggy
without
some
rules?
unknown
speaker
we
thought
that
we
had
managed
to
do
it
already.
unknown
speaker
sort
of
workable
i
think.
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
justice
cardozo;
he
said,
life
in
all
its
fullness
must
provide
the
answer
to
the
riddle.
he
had
not
read
the
three-factor
formula.
[laughter]
and
i
am
concerned
about
the
three-factor
formula
because
it
has
a
manufacturing
bias,
which
is
the
very
basis
for
your
attack
on
the
unitary
system.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
really
destroying
the
unitary
formula,
but
leaving
intact
as
a
protection
against
overreaching,
the
apportionment
formula
which
has
the
same
defect.
unknown
speaker
one
thing
at
a
time,
ms.
hamill.
unknown
speaker
you
are
relentless.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic
theory,
and
i
want
to
concentrate
on
the
first
point
that
your
opponent
made.
assume
the
hypothetical
we
talked
about
earlier
with
a
geographically
separate
small
operation
in
florida,
and
a
mammoth
business,
through
30
other
states
far
out
west,
but
no
connection
with
that
separate
operation
in
florida.
you
think
florida
has
the
power,
because
they
have
a
very
small
operation
in
florida
that
is
totally
unconnected
with
the
rest
of
their
business,
to
have
access
to
all
of
their
business
records
to
compute
the
tax
base
and
the
tax
should
be
paid.
you
don't
find
there's
any
jurisdictional
problem.
florida
provides
no
benefit
whatsoever
to
99.44
percent
of
their
business.
unknown
speaker
under
your
approach--
unknown
speaker
--to
include
them
in
income
and
audit
and
do
everything
else,
what
is
the...
are
you
troubled
at
all
by
the
question
of
whether
florida
in
that
situation
would
have
the
jurisdiction
to
base
their
tax
collection
on
an
operation
so
remote
from
what
happened
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
there
is
nothing
unfair--
unknown
speaker
--you
could
always
treat
every
business
as
unitary,
but
in
effect,
isn't
this
a
brand
new
concept
of
taxing
power
on
the
part
of
a
state?
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
set
a
foot
6
inches
into
the
state
jurisdiction
gives
that
state
the
power
to
say,
i
want
to
look
at
everything
you
have
done
all
over
the
world--
--and
apportion
the
entire--
--and
then
apportion
the
whole
thing.
that
doesn't
trouble
you
at
all?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
theory
was
you
couldn't
separate
it
in
an
accounting
sense
in
order
to
do
it
in
a
meaningful
way.
i
am
assuming
that
all
the
accounting,
and
all
the
rest,
is
perfectly
understandable
on
a
local
basis
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
that
there
can
ever
be
a
separate
operation
within
a
corporation.
unknown
speaker
that
the
butler
case
decided
that
all
corporations
are
totally
unitary
under
all
circumstances,
no
matter
how
diverse
their
businesses--
unknown
speaker
--anything
that
is
under
the
same
management.
unknown
speaker
under
the
same
ownership.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
case,
i
have
a
separate
manager
in
my
florida
parking
lot
and
then
i
don't
apportion?
unknown
speaker
then
the
same
management
is
the
same
as
the
same
ownership
because
every
corporation
has
a
chief
executive
officer.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
parent,
the
corporation
that
owns
stock
in
a
company
that
it
doesn't
really
control,
but
it
gets
paid
dividends?
is
that
corporation
under
the
same
management?
unknown
speaker
say
they
own
10
percent
of
a
subsidiary...
this
isn't
a
subsidiary
at
all.
they
just
own
10
percent
of
a
company
that
is
very
profitable
and
they
have
invested
some
money
in
it.
certainly,
they
are
not
under
the
same
management.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
really
care
about
unitary;
you
just...
as
you
say,
any
income
that
a
corporation
gets
from
any
other
corporation
is
apportionable
by--
unknown
speaker
--so
your
same
management
test
really
doesn't...
except
that,
it
is
the
same
management
that
runs
the
rest
of
the
company
that
decided
to
invest
in
this
company.
unknown
speaker
ms.
hamill,
i
have...
do
you
propose
that
your
theory
applies
only
to
a
corporation
in
florida,
for
example,
that
is
majority
owned
by
the
new
jersey
corporation
that
you
are
taxing?
unknown
speaker
10
percent?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
hamill.
mr.
hellerstein,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday,
the
fourth
of
may
at
ten
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
--what
about
a...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
what
about
a
domestic
corporation
incorporated
in
the
taxing
state?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
income
that
it
includes
within
the
gross
income
is
produced
by
activities
that
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
state.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
mean
residence
just
gives
a
connection
no
matter
where
the
income
comes
from.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be,
but
the
kind
of
an
argument
you're
making
would
seem
to
challenge
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
a
nondomiciliary
corporation
that
is
doing
business
in
the
state
and
it's
a...
and
there's
no
question
that
the
state
can
tax
its
share
of
the
income
of
that
corporation
because
it's
doing
business
there.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
would
say
that
that
nondomiciliary's
corporation
income
from
activities
that
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
state,
like
investment
income--
unknown
speaker
--would
have...
the
state
could
not
include
it
in
gross
income.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
a
difference
between
a
domiciliary
corporation
and
a
corporation
that
is
not
domiciliary
but
it's
doing
business
in
the
state
and
is
taxable
there
on
its
activities.
unknown
speaker
you
mean...
what
you
mean
is
that
there's
a
theory,
there's
an
accepted
theory
that
you
can
tax
a
domiciliary
corporation
on
all
of
its
income.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
hellerstein,
i
think
that
probably
asarco
put
forward
the
view
that
for
the
nondomiciliary
entity
to
be...
for
their
dividends
or
income
to
be
taxed
in
the
taxing
state
that
the
dividend
payor
has
to
be
unitary
with
the
payee.
something
more
is
required
under
asarco
than
just
a
flow
of
value
into
the
taxing
state
from
that
nondomestic
entity.
now,
do
you
think
that's
a
valid
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
there
certainly
is
language
in
asarco
that
would
say
just
that,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
so
there
has
to
be
some
flow
of
value
into
the
state,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
now,
if
you
agree
with
that,
can
you
say
there
is
no
such
value
that
flowed
in
here
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
purpose
of
the
investment
was
to
acquire
enough
capital
to
go
ahead
and
acquire
more
of
the
underlying
business
in
the
domestic
state?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
something
more
than
that?
maybe
it
isn't
the
hard-core
definition
of
working
capital,
but
it's
capital
for
a
longer
term
expansion,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
that
in
new
jersey
the
bendix
board
of
directors
meets
and
they
say
we
have
a
very
high-tech
speculative
research
project
we
want
to
conduct
in
new
jersey.
now,
the
only
reason
we're
willing
to
undertake
that
is
because
we
know
we
have
a
very
safe,
secure
investment
in
asarco.
there's
no
checks
flowing
back
and
forth,
but
isn't
there
a
value
there
that
the
company
relies
on?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
attenuated
in
the
real
sense?
isn't
the
example
i've
given
you,
the
example
of
a
very
real
business
kind
of
a
decision
and
a
business
kind
of
judgment,
and
isn't
this
the
way
a
business
is
properly
valued?
if
you
were
a
banker,
you'd
certainly
want
to
see
the
asarco
balance
sheet
before
you
lent
any
money
in
new
jersey,
if
you
thought
the
company
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that's
attenuated,
but
i
think
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
manufacturing
analogy
that
you're
relying
on
here
that
is
not
wholly
in
accord
with
the
way
many
modern
business
corporations
are
formulated
and
with
the
way
they
evaluate
their
own
assets.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
beauty
parlors
are
not
doing
well
and
they
borrow
money,
does
it
make
a
difference
to
taxation
whether
or
not
the
banker
looks
at
the
balance
sheet
to
see
that
the
parking
lots
are
in
the
balance
sheet?
unknown
speaker
well,
florida
can
surely
tax
the
real
estate
located
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
of
income.
unknown
speaker
a
what?
unknown
speaker
yes.
they'd
put
it
in
the,
what,
the
numerator--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
denominator.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
a
very
general
way,
perhaps,
but
there's
no
terribly
fire-strict
prohibition
against
that
sort
of
multiple
taxation,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
true
as
a
generality,
but
i
mean
i
think
what
you've
just
pointed
out,
perhaps,
is
arguably
a
rather
small
exception
to
it.
you
know,
land
located
in
florida,
a
traditionally
absolutely
immobile
thing,
has
always
been
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state
where
it's
located,
and
a
tax
on
a
capital
gain
resulting
from
the
sale
of
that
land,
i'm
not
sure
that
would
come
under
the
head
of
double
taxation
if
new
jersey
also
just
seeks
to
tax
a
proportionate
share
of
the
income.
unknown
speaker
mr....
well,
go
ahead.
i
want
to
ask
a
question
when
you
have
a
moment.
unknown
speaker
more
than
half
the
states
have
adopted
something
called
the
uniform
division
of
income
for
tax
purposes
act,
called
uditpa,
and
under
uditpa,
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
say...
it
would
define
what
is
business
income,
and
it
would
say
that
business
income
is
taxable
by
the
state,
and
that
it
includes
income
from
intangibles
if
the
acquisition,
management,
and
disposition
of
the
property
constitute
integral
parts
of
the
taxpayer's
regular
trade
or
business
operation.
now,
do
you
think
that
is
valid,
a
valid
concept?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
constitution
allows
that
but
not
one
step
further
in
terms
of
defining
taxable
income?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
do
you
think
uditpa
is
as
far
as
the
constitution
will
allow,
not
a
step
further?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
under
uditpa?
the
domiciliary
state
can
tax
all
the
intangible
income,
and
yet
if
it
fits
under
uditpa's
formula
in
another
state,
that
other
state
can
have
some
apportion.
unknown
speaker
is
the
principle
concern
with
double
taxation
the
taxing
authority
of
the
domicile
state?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not...
if
the
state...
if
the
corporation
is
incorporated
in
the
state
of
illinois,
is
the
concern
that
illinois
will
cause
the
double
taxation,
or
is
the
concern
if
we
adopt
the
new
jersey
regime,
that
there
will
be
double
taxation
in
all
of
the
other
49
states,
or
in
some
of
the
other
49
states?
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
just
tell
me
what
the
third
point
you
were
going
to
make
was
when
you
started
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hellerstein.
ms.
hamill.
unknown
speaker
unitary
business
concept
is
just
out
of
the
picture
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
draw
a
line
where
it
is
in,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
if
you
do
that,
then
can
the
state,
where
the
subsidiary
is
resident,
so
to
speak,
can
it
tax
all
100
percent
of
the
income,
even
though
new
jersey
is
going
to
take
a
share
of
it
too?
unknown
speaker
the
dividends,
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
subsidiary
sure
does.
[laughter]
and
so
does
the
parent.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
is
business
income?
unknown
speaker
would
you
win
under
the
uditpa
definition
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
you
would
make
the
submission
that
uditpa
itself
is
an
unworkable
rule?
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
us
to
overrule
asarco.
[laughter]
what
is
the
constitutional
rule
that
you
replace
asarco
with
in
the
uditpa
states?
can
the
domiciliary
state
now
tax
so
that
you
can
have
two
states
taxing,
or
is
it
only
new
jersey,
the
nondomiciliary
states
that
can
apportion?
are
you
going
to
have
double
taxation--
unknown
speaker
--or
is
it
that
the
domiciliary
state
gets
frozen
out?
unknown
speaker
because
of
disagreements
of
opinion
of
what
kind
of
an
income
it
is.
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
assuming
everybody
agrees
what
kind
of
income
it
is.
unknown
speaker
can
they
both
tax
it
or
can
only
the
state,
the
allocating
state
tax
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
your
theory.
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
asking
you,
under
your
theory,
don't
put
it
on
me,
you
say
it
depends
on
what
you
think
the
basis
is.
what
do
you
think
the
basis
is?
unknown
speaker
they
can
both
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
shouldn't
encourage
it,
should
we,
at
least
if
we
follow
language
in
our
prior
opinions,
that
isn't
a
goal
to
be
achieved.
it
is
to
be
avoided.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about,
i
think
it
is
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
if
we
assume
a
business
that
has
its
major
operations
in
california,
have
a
whole
bunch
of
operations
there,
but
none
of
them
on
the
east
coast
and
all,
and
they
also
separately
buy
and
sell
a
parking
lot
in
florida
which
under
traditional
rules
would
not
have
been
considered
part
of
the
unitary
business.
it
would
be
considered
a
separate
transaction.
in
your
view,
could
florida
tax
the
entire
income
from
the
separate
transaction,
or
must
it
treat
it
as
part
of
a
unitary
business
in
the
same
corporate
shell?
unknown
speaker
could
have
an
option
to
do
it
either
way.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
that
would
be
constitutionally
wrong
is
it
would
lead
to
double
taxation
which--
unknown
speaker
--would
not
otherwise
occur
under
our
present
regime?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
wouldn't,
because
i
am
assuming,
my
hypothesis
is
that
it
is
not
a
unitary
business
under
present
rules.
unknown
speaker
see,
that
would
cause
a
change
which
would
increase
the
possibility
of
double
taxation.
unknown
speaker
yet,
yet.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
those
states
could
change
their
laws.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
your
hypothesis
holds,
uditpa
also
is
unworkable
and
i
think
that
should
be
stricken
down
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
rewriting
the
basic
formula
under
the
due
process
clause.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
unitarian
concepts
are,
for
the
most
part,
out
of
the
window?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
states
will
not
maximize
their
taxable
authority?
unknown
speaker
they
will
simply
have
to
be
reasonable;
even
if
they
weren't,
they
could
get
away
with
taxing
more.
unknown
speaker
that
will
be
our
principle,
you
can
tax
whatever
you
like,
but
don't
be
too
piggy.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that
will
put
the
fear
of
the
lord
in
them.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
decide
then
if
it
is
being
too
piggy
without
some
rules?
unknown
speaker
we
thought
that
we
had
managed
to
do
it
already.
unknown
speaker
sort
of
workable
i
think.
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
justice
cardozo;
he
said,
life
in
all
its
fullness
must
provide
the
answer
to
the
riddle.
he
had
not
read
the
three-factor
formula.
[laughter]
and
i
am
concerned
about
the
three-factor
formula
because
it
has
a
manufacturing
bias,
which
is
the
very
basis
for
your
attack
on
the
unitary
system.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
really
destroying
the
unitary
formula,
but
leaving
intact
as
a
protection
against
overreaching,
the
apportionment
formula
which
has
the
same
defect.
unknown
speaker
one
thing
at
a
time,
ms.
hamill.
unknown
speaker
you
are
relentless.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic
theory,
and
i
want
to
concentrate
on
the
first
point
that
your
opponent
made.
assume
the
hypothetical
we
talked
about
earlier
with
a
geographically
separate
small
operation
in
florida,
and
a
mammoth
business,
through
30
other
states
far
out
west,
but
no
connection
with
that
separate
operation
in
florida.
you
think
florida
has
the
power,
because
they
have
a
very
small
operation
in
florida
that
is
totally
unconnected
with
the
rest
of
their
business,
to
have
access
to
all
of
their
business
records
to
compute
the
tax
base
and
the
tax
should
be
paid.
you
don't
find
there's
any
jurisdictional
problem.
florida
provides
no
benefit
whatsoever
to
99.44
percent
of
their
business.
unknown
speaker
under
your
approach--
unknown
speaker
--to
include
them
in
income
and
audit
and
do
everything
else,
what
is
the...
are
you
troubled
at
all
by
the
question
of
whether
florida
in
that
situation
would
have
the
jurisdiction
to
base
their
tax
collection
on
an
operation
so
remote
from
what
happened
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
there
is
nothing
unfair--
unknown
speaker
--you
could
always
treat
every
business
as
unitary,
but
in
effect,
isn't
this
a
brand
new
concept
of
taxing
power
on
the
part
of
a
state?
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
set
a
foot
6
inches
into
the
state
jurisdiction
gives
that
state
the
power
to
say,
i
want
to
look
at
everything
you
have
done
all
over
the
world--
--and
apportion
the
entire--
--and
then
apportion
the
whole
thing.
that
doesn't
trouble
you
at
all?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
theory
was
you
couldn't
separate
it
in
an
accounting
sense
in
order
to
do
it
in
a
meaningful
way.
i
am
assuming
that
all
the
accounting,
and
all
the
rest,
is
perfectly
understandable
on
a
local
basis
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
that
there
can
ever
be
a
separate
operation
within
a
corporation.
unknown
speaker
that
the
butler
case
decided
that
all
corporations
are
totally
unitary
under
all
circumstances,
no
matter
how
diverse
their
businesses--
unknown
speaker
--anything
that
is
under
the
same
management.
unknown
speaker
under
the
same
ownership.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
case,
i
have
a
separate
manager
in
my
florida
parking
lot
and
then
i
don't
apportion?
unknown
speaker
then
the
same
management
is
the
same
as
the
same
ownership
because
every
corporation
has
a
chief
executive
officer.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
parent,
the
corporation
that
owns
stock
in
a
company
that
it
doesn't
really
control,
but
it
gets
paid
dividends?
is
that
corporation
under
the
same
management?
unknown
speaker
say
they
own
10
percent
of
a
subsidiary...
this
isn't
a
subsidiary
at
all.
they
just
own
10
percent
of
a
company
that
is
very
profitable
and
they
have
invested
some
money
in
it.
certainly,
they
are
not
under
the
same
management.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
really
care
about
unitary;
you
just...
as
you
say,
any
income
that
a
corporation
gets
from
any
other
corporation
is
apportionable
by--
unknown
speaker
--so
your
same
management
test
really
doesn't...
except
that,
it
is
the
same
management
that
runs
the
rest
of
the
company
that
decided
to
invest
in
this
company.
unknown
speaker
ms.
hamill,
i
have...
do
you
propose
that
your
theory
applies
only
to
a
corporation
in
florida,
for
example,
that
is
majority
owned
by
the
new
jersey
corporation
that
you
are
taxing?
unknown
speaker
10
percent?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
hamill.
mr.
hellerstein,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday,
the
fourth
of
may
at
ten
o'clock.
