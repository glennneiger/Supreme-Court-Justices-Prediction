justice
scalia
but
you
did
risk
his
ire.
i
mean,
you...
you...
you
went
on
and
stated
for
the
record
the
evidence.
and
it's
on
the
bottom
of
page
10.
and
not
a
single
iota
of
that
evidence
has
anything
to
do
with
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
scalia
you
say
these
conditions
exist.
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
these
conditions.
i
mean,
arbitrariness
is...
is...
is...
a
word
we
use
to
describe
any
basis
for
reversing
an
agency.
if
the
agency
hasn't
acted
reasonably...
is
that
what
you
mean?
if
the
prosecutor's
refusal
to
grant
a
reduction
or
to
ask
for
a
reduction
is
unreasonable,
is
that
enough?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that's
not
very
helpful.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--if
we
say
it
does,
it
does.
it's
just
unreasonable.
this
guy's
been
a
lot
of
help,
and
the
prosecutor...
he's
not
denying
it
because
of
the
defendant's
race;
he's
not
denying
it
because
the
defendant's
sister
jilted
him...
he
just
unreasonably
denies
it.
it's
terribly
unreasonable.
the
fellow
was
a
lot
of
help.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
it's
correct?
that's
a
basis
for
overturning
it.
you
want
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
say
it's
just
terribly
unreasonable.
justice
scalia
how
do
you
describe
them?
what
do
you
want...
really
unreasonable,
underscore
really?
i
mean
i
can
tell...
you
know,
if
you
say
it
has
to
be
a
constitutional
violation,
it
has
to
be
done
because
of
his
race,
for
example.
i
mean
that
narrows
the
class
to
something
i
can,
you
know,
sink
my
teeth
into.
but
just
to
come
up
and
say
arbitrary...
anything's
arbitrary.
justice
scalia
why
should
there
be
any
review
of
this
at
all,
i
mean
for
anything...
bad
faith,
arbitrariness,
outrageous
unreasonableness,
or
even
unconstitutionality?
i
mean
if
your
client
wants
to
make
a
deal
he
can
make
a
deal.
and
you
can
get
relief
for
the
government's
going
back
on
its
promise.
but
for
the
government's...
when
the
government
hasn't
promised,
why
should
you
have
any
relief
at
all?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
know...
what
about
if
the
government,
you
know,
it
has
discretion
to
choose
not
to
prosecute.
suppose
it
chooses
not
to
prosecute
somebody
for
some
unconstitutional
reason.
can
somebody
come
in
here
and
get
that
corrected?
justice
scalia
like
equal
protection.
justice
scalia
suppose
in
the
instance
that
counsel
posed,
that
you
do
have
a
prosecutor
who
seems
to
be
more
lenient
towards
women
defendants
than
towards
men.
is
that
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
the--
justice
scalia
--to
the
male
defendants?
justice
scalia
well,
i
must
say
that's...
we
have
a
lot
of
statutes
that
commit
things
to
the
discretion
of
agents
of
the
executive
branch.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
that
is
ever
taken
to
mean
absolute
discretion.
it
means
reasonable
discretion.
and
if
you
act
arbitrarily
or
capriciously,
you're
acting
unlawfully.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
don't
deny
that.
i...
i'm...
like
justice
kennedy,
i'm
just
bemused
at
why
we
have
somehow
have
authority
to
move
in
for
constitutional
violations,
but
not
for
statutory
violations.
against
the
law
is
against
the
law.
