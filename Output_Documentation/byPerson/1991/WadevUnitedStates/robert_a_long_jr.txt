mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
begin
my
argument,
let
me
respond
to
the
suggestion
that
there
may
have
been
some
sort
of
promises
made
by
dea
agents
in
this
case.
that
is
completely
outside
the
record.
i
am
prepared
to
say
other
things
that
would
go
outside
the
record.
i
think
perhaps
i
should
not,
unless
you
invite
me.
but
i
would
simply
note...
first
of
all,
under
this
court's
decision
in
maybury
against
johnson,
i
think
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
deal
made
that
was
not
then
adhered
to,
the
guilty
plea
which
the
petitioner
entered
in
this
case
would
have
been
the
locus
of
any
constitutional
violation.
so
even
assuming
what
has
been
suggested
here
this
morning
is
true,
and
it...
it
is
not
true,
to
my
knowledge...
it
would
not
be
a
constitutional
violation,
and
so
it
would
not
entitle
petitioner
to
the
kind
of
relief
he's
seeking
here.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
did
not
go
far
enough.
it
spoke
in
categorical
terms.
and
we
think
they
have
to
be
qualified.
but
we
think
that's
not
surprising--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
didn't
qualify
its
statement,
it
was...
it
incompletely--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it
was...
this
case
did
not--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
what
they
said.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
don't
agree
with
that
as
an
unqualified
statement.
but
we
think
it's
not
surprising
that
the
fourth
circuit
made
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we
think
it's
subject
to
a
very
limited
form
of
judicial
challenge,
if
the
defendant
can
make
a
substantial
threshold
showing
that
the
prosecutor
is
exercising
discretion
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
and
there
was
no
suggestion--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
we
think
that
is
the
limit.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
the
problem.
bad
faith
and
arbitrariness
are
vague
terms
that
can
take
on
different
meanings.
in--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
[laughter]
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
we
understood
them
to
adopt
a
very
limited
definition
of
bad
faith
and
arbitrariness,
that
we
think
is
really
just
another
way
of
stating
the
type
of
judicial
review
that
we
think
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no,
our
view
of
this
section
is
that
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
any
obligation
to
make
this
motion
in
any
particular
case,
even
if
the
defendant
has
provided
a
tremendous
amount
of
assistance.
that
the
language
simply
says
upon
motion
of
the
government.
it
does
not
state
any
standards
for
the
government
to
follow.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
concede
that,
justice
o'connor.
we
do
not
believe
that
either
the
statute,
3553(e),
or
the
guideline,
5k1.1,
creates
any
protective
liberty
interest
because
it
does
not
confine
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor
in
any
meaningful
way.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
think
it
is
very
closely
analogous
to
the
discretion
whether
to
bring
a
charge
and
the
selection
of
charges
to
bring.
and,
in
fact,
in
a
very
small
amount
of
legislative
history
that
there
is
to
go
along
with
3553(e)
recognizes
that
express
connection.
it
says
that
this
is
a
way
of
doing
in
the
open
what
the
prosecutor
would
otherwise
do
by
manipulating
the
charging
decision,
in
effect.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
think
it
is
a
different
situation
if
the
government
makes
a
plea
bargain.
the
government
can
be
held
to
its
bargain
or--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--if
the
government
makes
that
promise,
the
government
can
be
held
to
it
by
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
as
we
read
your...
the
court's
decision
in
maybury
against
johnson,
as
long
as
the
defendant
then
goes
ahead
and
pleads
guilty,
and
it's
a
properly
counseled
guilty
plea,
there's
no
constitutional
violation
in
that
case.
that
may
be
unethical
behavior
by
the
prosecutor,
and
it
may
be
redressable
in
some
other
way.
but
it
would
not
be
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
would
say
not.
but
i
think
that's
a
question
of
plea
bargains.
and
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
plea
bargain.
under...
we
would
say
certainly
that
would
not
be
allowed
under
5k1.1,
itself,
or--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--oh,
yes.
i
think
if
the
guilty
plea--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--if
the...
if
the...
if
the
guilty
plea
is
induced
by
a
misrepresentation
of
the
government,
then
under
santabello
and
other
cases,
then
the
guilty
plea
is
invalid.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
could
be.
but
again,
that's
a
question
that...
we
think
that's
a
question
of
plea
bargaining
rather
than
a
question
particular
to
5k1.1.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think...
in
a
particular
case,
that
would...
that
likely
would
be
the
government's
position.
we'd
try
to
get
the
plea
bargain
written
down--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
it
says
specifically
that
anything
that's
not
written
in
this
agreement
is
not
part
of
the
agreement,
and
you're
not
relying
on
any
other
promises.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
what
about
apart
from
plea
bargain
situation,
what...
what
do
you
envision
as
constituting
these
constitutional
violation
exceptions?
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we
think--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
think
that
it
could
be.
in
this
case
it's
prosecutorial
discretion
decisions,
like
the
way
he
exercises
discretion.
if
it
was
deliberately
intended
to
disfavor
a
suspect
classification
like
race,
or
a
semisuspect
classification
like
sex,
we
think
that
could
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation.
but...
i'm
familiar
with
the
particular
case
you
mentioned,
redondo
lemos.
and
it's...
simply
showing
that
there's
some
sort
of
discrepancy
in
the
sentences
that
men
and
women
receive,
i
think,
would
not
go
nearly
far
enough
to
show
any
sort
of
a
constitutional
violation.
because
it
may
well
be
that
the
women
defendants
are
not
similarly-situated...
that
is,
they
may
have
a
more
minor
role
in
crimes
as
a
group,
or
they
may
be
more
willing
to
provide
assistance
to
the
prosecutor.
those,
of
course,
are
perfectly
legitimate
considerations.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
at
467
u.s.
504.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
that's
it.
we
derived
this
from
this
court's
prior
decisions
on
prosecutorial
discretion
cases,
which
have
never
found
a
violation,
but
have
always
suggested
that
the
court
could
inquire.
we
think
it
is
part
of
the
inherent
supervisory
power
of
the
court,
in
the
course
of
sentencing,
or
in
the
course
of
proceeding
on
charges.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
because
it's
established
under
the
bank
of
nova
scotia
and
other
decisions
that
the
court
cannot
exercise
its
supervisory
power
to
negate
statutes.
and
we
think
it's
clear...
indeed,
we
think
the
petitioner
concedes...
that
congress
intended,
in
3553(e),
and
the
sentencing
commission
intended
in
5k1.1,
to
commit
to
the
prosecutor's
discretion
this
decision
whether
to
file
a
motion.
if
the
court
were
to
simply
begin
second-guessing
it
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--so
there's
been
an
unconstitutional
exercise.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
no,
our
view
of
this
is
that
it
commits
the
decision
to
the
prosecutor's
discretion
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
our
view
of
it
is
the
only
type
of
abuse
that's
created
here
is
the...
is
the
decision
for
unconstitutional
reason.
we
believe
the
prosecutor
could
refuse
to
file
this
motion
for
any
reason,
or
for
no
reason...
as
long
as
it's
not
an
unconstitutional
reason.
that's
our
position.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again,
justice
scalia,
we
don't
think
this
is
the
typical
case
of
agency
action,
where
there's
a
strong
presumption
of
judicial
review.
if
there
were
that
presumption
we'd
take
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
upon
motion
of
the
government
and
refute
it.
but
in
addition,
we're--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
distinction,
and
we
draw
it
from
this
court's
decision
in
cases
such
as
webster
against
doe,
is
that
if
the
congress
means
to
preclude
review
of
constitutional
questions,
unless
they
say
so
extremely
clearly...
there's
a
kind
of
a
plain
statement
requirement...
and,
of
course,
we
also
draw
it
from
cases
closer
to
this
situation
in
prosecutorial
discretion
cases,
such
as
wayte,
bordenkircher,
and
boiler
against
bowles,
where
this
court
has
always
assumed
that
that
kind
of
violation
would
be
subject
to
a
judicial
review.
and
we
think
that
it
is
a...
a
proper
exercise
of
the
court's
supervisory
authority,
if
confined
to
this
very
narrow
situation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
we
think
that
would
be
proper
if,
for
example,
the
u.s.
attorney
decided
that
they
were
getting
good
cooperation
from
defendants
in
that
district,
and
there
was
no
particular
reason
to
allow
defendants
to
have
less
than
the
minimum
sentence
that
congress
has
established...
or
the
sentencing
commission
has
established.
we
think
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
in
fact,
we
think
it
is
required
by
the
language
that
the
congress
used,
and
they
emphasized
it
in
3553(e),
in
the
heading.
it
says
a
limited
authority
may
impose
the
statute
below...
a
sentence,
rather,
below
the
statutory
minimum.
that
is
authority
limited
to
the
situation
in
which...
in
which
the
prosecutor
files
a
motion.
and
we
think,
even
in
addition
to
the
language
and
the
legislative
history,
which
draws
the
express
connection
to
other
matters
committed
to
prosecutorial
discretion,
such
as
the
charging
decision,
we
think
the
nature
of
this
substantial
assistance
decision
really
is
quite
analogous
to
the
charging
decision.
the
judicial
review
of
this
would
require
courts
to
get
into
matters
that
are
really
not
well-suited
to
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
we
have
internal
guidelines--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
we
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
any
particular
process
within
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again,
there
might
be
abuse
of
discretion
in
a
sort
of
ordinary,
administrative
law
sense.
but
we...
in
this
area
of
prosecutorial
discretion,
we
don't
think
that
that's
something
that
the
courts
can
or
should
review.
i
wanted
to
add
that
there
is
an
internal
procedure
now
in
effect,
that
these
motions
can
only
be
filed
with
the
approval
of
the
u.s.
attorney,
first
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
or
one
of
the
supervisors
in
the
criminal
division
of
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
so
that
your
question
really
is
a
hypothetical
one
and
it
should
not
happen
in
practice.
it
was
mentioned
that
this
sort
of
question,
if
reviewed
by
courts,
would
require
them
to
get
into
factors
that
really
are
not
suitable
for
judicial
review.
they'd
have
to
balance
the
deterrent
value
of
going
ahead
and
sentencing
a
convicted
defendant
to
at
least
the
minimum
sentence
proscribed
by
law,
against
the
potential
benefit
of
encouraging
other
defendants
to
cooperate
with
the
government...
which
we
think
is
the
whole
purpose
of
these
substantial
assistance
provisions.
and
that
sort
of
judgment
will
often
turn
on
the
government's
enforcement
priorities,
and
enforcement
plan,
as
in
the
charging
decision
that
this
court
discussed
in
wayte.
review
would
also
impose
some
very
significant,
systemic
costs.
it
would
certainly
delay
proceedings;
the
deliberations
of
the
u.s.
attorneys
would
be
opened
to
outside
inquiry.
and
we
think
that
the
prosecutorial
effectiveness
might
be
undermined
if
the
government's
enforcement
policies
were
revealed.
if
defendants
knew
exactly
how
much
cooperation
they
had
to
supply
in
order
to
come
within
some
standards,
they
would
probably
do
the
minimum,
and
not
give
all
the
cooperation
that
they
could.
we
think
it's
clear
that
defendants
would
seek
extensive
discovery...
not
just
about
their
own
case,
but
about
other
cases...
because
they'd
want
to
make
comparisons;
they
would
want
the
prosecutor
to
explain,
probably
take
the
stand...
if
they
could
get
him
to
do
it...
and
explain
the
basis
for
the
decision.
and
really,
that's
precisely
what
the
petitioner
is
asking
for
in
this
case.
at
page
11
of
his
petition,
he
said
that
he
wanted
an
inquiry
on
the
record
as
to
the...
as
to
the
decision-making
process
in
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina,
in
general;
as
well
as
the
decision-making
process
in
this
case,
in
particular.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
and
no
doubt
we
would--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
right.
i'm
sure
we
would
oppose
that
discovery
if
we
got
to
that
point.
but
that
would
be
the
direction
in
which
we
would
be
headed.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
if
i
could
what
we
think
is
a
basic
difference
between
the
substantial
assistance
provision
and
certain
adjustments
to
the
base
offense
level
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
recognize.
there
are
adjustments
for
obstruction
of
justice,
for
acceptance
of
responsibility;
there's
a
victim-related
adjustment;
adjustment
for
role
in
the
offense.
now,
those
adjustments
are
required
in
certain
circumstances,
by
the
language
of
the
guidelines.
and
we
think
that's
so
because
they
are
things
that
the
defendant
really
has
control
over.
the
defendant
controls
whether
he
obstructs
justice,
or
whether
he
took
a
minor
role
in
the
offense
or
not.
and
we
think
they
also
go
to
the
defendant's
level
of
culpability.
we
think
substantial
assistance
is
really
different
in
a
basic
way.
the
defendant
may
be
very
willing
to
help,
and
wants
to
do
all
he
can
for
the
government,
truly
sorry
for
his
offenses.
but
if
he
hasn't
got
valuable
information,
he's
not
going
to
get
this
substantial
assistance
motion.
he's
not
entitled
to
it.
in
fact,
the
sentencing
commission
amended
5k1.1
in
1989
to
make
it
clear
that
a
good-faith
effort
is
not
good
enough.
you
have
to
produce
results.
and
you
may,
through
no
fault
of
your
own,
just
be
unable
to
produce
results.
so
we
think
the
substantial
assistance
motion
is
not
something
that's
a
right
to
any
particular
defendant.
it
doesn't
necessarily
reflect
their
culpability.
rather,
it
is
a
tool
that's
available
to
the
prosecutor,
like
the
charging
decision,
to
conduct
his
business,
and
in
the
public
interest,
and
to
encourage
cooperation,
while
still
attempting
to
prosecute
the
guilty.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
something
i'm
not
sure
of.
i'm
not
positive.
my
strong
feeling
is
that
plea
agreements
can
be
made
at
different
stages
in
the
prosecution...
not
just
at
the
end,
but
at
the
beginning.
so
i
think
it
would
be
practicable
for
a
defendant
to
make
that
kind
of
agreement.
but
i'm
not
positive.
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
review.
we've
addressed
that
already.
as
long
as
petitioner
confines
himself
to
the
narrow
definition
that
he
adopted
in
his
reply
brief,
we
think
that's
really
just
another
way
of
stating
the
kind
of
review
that
we
think
is
available,
we
don't
object
to
it.
and
i
think
i
heard--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
i
think
i
heard
him
this
morning
revert
back
to
what
he
seemed
to
be
suggesting...
not
in
any
detail
in
his
opening
brief...
which
is
that
a
decision
couldn't
violate
substantive
due
process,
if
it
was
just
very
wrong,
a
big
mistake.
and
we
think
that's
not
correct.
this
court
has
recognized
that
defendants
are
not
entitled
to
individualized
sentencing
outside
the
capital
sentencing
context.
petitioner
was
convicted
in
accordance
with
laws.
so
we
think
he's
eligible
for
any
punishment
that's
authorized
by
the
statute,
as
long
as
it's
not
cruel
and
unusual,
or
based
on
the
kind
of
arbitrary
distinction
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause.
and
finally,
let
me
just
say
a
word
about
the
remand
question.
there
may
not
be
much
left
to
say
about
that.
but
let
me
just
read
from
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
was
the
sentencing
hearing.
in
fact,
let
me
just
back
up
for
a
minute,
and
point
it
out.
on
page
8,
petitioner
was
really
making
a
very
different
argument
to
the
district
court.
if
you
look
on
page
8,
at
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
it
says,
my
argument
is
that
at
section
5k2.0
of
the
guidelines...
a
different
provision
of
the
guidelines,
which
is
the
general
provisions
of
departure...
the
court
is
allowed
to
take
into
consideration
items
and
information
and
evidence,
which,
if
it
considers
them
not
to
have
been
treated,
or
if
it
considers
them
not
to
have
been
adequately
taken
into
consideration.
and
my
argument
to
you
is
that
the
evidence
in
the
pre-sentence
report
would
indicate
that
there
is
a
level
of
cooperation...
and
although
the
government,
in
its
wisdom,
chose
not
to
grant
substantial
assistance...
they
may
not
have
been
adequately
taken
into
consideration
by
the
sentencing
commission,
that
this
type
of
evidence
might
allow
for
a
downward
departure.
that's
really
a
very
different
argument.
he
helped
so
much
in
this
case
that
the
sentencing
commission
really
couldn't
have
taken
into
account
this
level
of
assistance.
and
therefore,
this
goes
beyond
5k1.1
and
takes
him
into
the
realm
of
this
other
guideline.
and
the
court,
quite
reasonably,
responded
well,
maybe
that's
true
or
maybe
it's
not.
but
here
we
have
a
15-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
you're
not
suggesting
that
i
could
go
below
a
sentence
established
directly
by
congress,
are
you?
and
the
petitioner
responded,
well,
i
believe
that
you
could.
i
do
not...
i'm
now
on
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix...
i
do
not
have
a
case
to
cite
to
you
on
that.
and
that's
the
point
where
the
court
said
well,
i
believe
i'm
going
to
let
you
make
some
law.
because
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
do
not
believe
i
have
that
authority...
addressing
this
other
argument
that
petitioner
made.
and
then,
of
course,
the...
on
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
part
that
we've
already
been
over,
the
court
did
say,
you
may
state
for
the
record,
in
the
event
you
desire
to
appeal,
what
the
evidence
would
be,
inviting
petitioner
to
make
a
proffer.
and
then
he
did.
he
went
on
for
several
paragraphs
proffering
his
evidence.
he
went
exclusively
to
the
help
he'd
given,
the
cooperation
he'd
given.
and
the
court
said,
all
right,
sir.
and
petitioner's
lawyer
said,
that
would
be
our
proffer.
so
we
think
that
petitioner
has
had
a
perfectly
adequate
full
opportunity
to
present
whatever
his
evidence
would
be.
and
so
a
remand
in
this
case
is
certainly
not
warranted.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
