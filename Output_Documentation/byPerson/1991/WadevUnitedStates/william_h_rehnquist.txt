chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-5771,
harold
ray
wade
v.
united
states.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
while
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
government
agrees
that
if
a
showing
is
made,
it...
the
judge
can
certainly
inquire
into
what
the...
what
the
prosecution's
reasons
were
for
not
making
a...
making
a
motion.
but
i
don't
think
the
government
agrees
that
showing
was
made
here.
i
don't
think
the
government
agrees
there
should
be
a
remand,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
you
make
any
sort
of
a
proffer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
would...
what
did
the
proffer
consist
of?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
it
consist
of
any
showings,
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
government
was
denying
mr.
wade
his
constitutional
rights?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
putting
on
evidence
is
different
from
a
proffer.
i
think
a
judge
is
entitled
to
first
say
you
make
your
proffer,
and
then
i'll
see
whether
i'll
let
you
put
on
evidence.
and
if
your
proffer
was
insufficient,
he
was
entitled
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
hear
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there
can
be
good
reasons
and
bad
reasons
for
denying
a
particular
motion.
and
if
your
proffer
does
not
show
that
the
reason
must
have
been
bad,
you're
not
in
good
shape;
as
opposed
to
whether
your
proffer...
your
proffer,
if
believed,
would
show
that
the
reason
would
have
been
bad.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
page
are
you
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
surely
there
are
much
more
direct
ways
of
bringing
it
up
with
him
than
the
language
you
just
quoted.
i
would
say
that
was
oblique,
at
best.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you
better
argue
on
the
record
before
us.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let
me
rephrase,
if
i
may...
and
perhaps
justice
souter
won't
regard
it
as
a
rephrasing.
isn't
the
question
whether
the
proffer
you
made
is...
would
have
been
sufficient
if
evidence
to
back
it
up
were
produced
to
obtain
relief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you've
answered...
you've
said
remand,
remand,
remand.
we
have
asked
you
specific
questions,
and
all
you...
you
don't
come
up,
it
seems
to
me,
with
any
justification.
all
you
say
is
that
there
should
be
a
remand.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
know,
we're
not
enlarging
the
record
here.
we're
not
interested
in
what
went
through
your
mind
that
isn't
on
the
record.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
we've
probably
spent
enough
time
on
this
particular
aspect,
but
why
don't
you
go
on
to
the
rest
of
your
argument,
mr.--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
mr.
long,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
long,
a
couple
of
times
you've
mentioned
the
case
of
maybury
against
johnson,
which
i
don't
find
cited
in
your
brief.
could
you
give
us
a
citation
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
is
a
constitutional
violation,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
martin,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.91-5771,
wade
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
