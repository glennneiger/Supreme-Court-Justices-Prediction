justice
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
implicit
in
your
proffer
is
an
attempt
to
show
that
the
government
was
acting
in
bad
faith?
justice
kennedy
well--
justice
kennedy
--well,
i
take
it
from
your
brief
you'd
go
even
further.
suppose
there's
a
good
faith
disagreement
as
to
whether
there's
been
substantial
cooperation.
you
think
there
has
been;
the
government
thinks
there
has
not
been.
is
it
your
position
that
you're
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
dispute?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
government
is
just
plain
wrong.
there's
been
substantial
cooperation
but
the
government
just
is
wrong
because
it
characterizes
it
as
insubstantial.
so
long
as
the
government's
in
good
faith,
in
your
view
there's
still...
there's
no
hearing?
i
thought
your
position
was
that
you're
always
entitled
to
show
that
the
government
has
just
made
a
determination
that's
factually
incorrect.
justice
kennedy
is
that
your
position
or
isn't
it?
i
don't
want
to
talk
you
into
something
you
don't
want
to
argue.
justice
kennedy
that's
the
way
i
read
your
brief.
justice
kennedy
well,
isn't
it
your
position
that
that's
all
you
need?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
why
not.
justice
kennedy
so
you
disagree
with
the
brief
of
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers?
justice
kennedy
and
so
you
disagree
with
it
to
that
extent.
justice
kennedy
mr.
long,
suppose
the
prosecutor
knows
that
there
has
been
substantial
assistance.
must
the
prosecutor
make
the
motion
so
far
as
the
prosecutor's
duties
under
the
law
are
concerned,
quite
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
this
is
enforceable
in
court?
justice
kennedy
is
this...
is
the
discretion
the
same
as
the
discretion
to
prosecute
or
not
to
prosecute?
justice
kennedy
because
it's
a
plea
bargain?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
theory
that
permits
the
court
to
inquire
if
there's
a
constitutional
violation,
that
the
processes
of
the
court
cannot
be
used
to
reach
an
unconstitutional
result?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
you
can
inquire
under
the
supervisory
powers
to
prevent
a
constitutional
violation,
why
not
to
prevent
a
statutory
violation?
justice
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
prosecutor's
discretion,
and
therefore
the
statute.
justice
kennedy
no,
not
unconstitutional,
just
an
abuse
of
discretion...
unless
you're
saying
all
abuses
of
discretion
are
unconstitutional.
justice
kennedy
but
i'm
assuming
that
this
discretion
has
been
abused.
justice
kennedy
can
a
united
states
attorney,
in
your
view
properly,
say
that
in
this
district
we're
not
going
to
give
any
credit
for
cooperation,
ever?
we're
just
not
going
to
enforce
that
part
of
the
statute.
justice
kennedy
and
you
think
that
this
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
congress,
as
expressed
in
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
district
said
that
you
have
to
give
credit
for
cooperation.
but
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
took
the
other
position.
he
says
this
is
just
not
necessary,
and
it's
a...
our
sentences
are
too
low.
and
he
refused
to
follow
the
orders
of
the
united
states
attorney.
could
the...
would
the
defendant
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
that
instance?
would
there
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
there?
justice
kennedy
well,
just
play
with
the
hypothetical,
if
you
could.
justice
kennedy
and
there's
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
that
instance?
justice
kennedy
--can
you
tell
me,
suppose
the
defendant
thinks
he
can
produce
a
very
important
result.
is
it
practicable
for
him
to
insist
on
a
plea
agreement
at
this
early
stage
of
investigations,
or
are
plea
agreements
usually
so
close
to
the
time
of
a
plea
that
the
cooperation
would
have
either
taken
place
or
not,
by
that
point?
