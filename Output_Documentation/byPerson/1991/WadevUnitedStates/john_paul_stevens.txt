justice
stevens
well,
mr.
martin,
it
is
true
that
the
judge
did
allow
you
to
state
for
the
record,
in
the
event
you
desired
to
appeal,
what
the
evidence
would
be.
justice
stevens
you
knew
you
were
going
to
lose.
that
much
is
perfectly
clear.
but
you
were
given
the
opportunity
to
say
why
you
thought
you
ought
to
win.
justice
stevens
you
just
said
this
defendant
provided
a
lot
of
assistance
from
the
government,
they
should
have
given
him
a
break.
justice
stevens
but
what
if
it's
not
in
a
plea
bargain?
what
if
the...
what
if
the
arrangement
is
made,
and
there's...
assume
ample
evidence,
and
the
prosecutor,
after
having
it,
thinks
well,
i
made
a
mistake.
i
shouldn't
have
made
that
deal.
but
the
defendant
delivers.
he
says
i
can
get
mr.
x
caught
for
you.
and
we
get
him
put
in
jail,
and
all
the
rest.
so
total
delivery.
but
the
government...
then,
he
says,
and
he
comes
up
for
plea
bargain,
the
government
changes
its
mind.
what
about
that
case?
justice
stevens
well,
would
it
be
redressable
by
some
kind
of
an
action
for
specific
enforcement
to
compel
the
government
to
make
the
motion
pursuant
to
its
promise,
for
which
there
was
a
consideration?
justice
stevens
of
course
we
could...
we
wouldn't
necessarily
allow
all
that
discovery,
if
we
disagreed
with
your
position.
justice
stevens
you
could
require
him
to
just
tell
his
own
story,
and
see
what--
justice
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
it...
how
do
you
know
that
he's
uncounseled
at
that
time?
