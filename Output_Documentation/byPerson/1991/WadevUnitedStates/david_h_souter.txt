justice
souter
well,
did
you
try
to
proffer
that?
justice
souter
well,
that's
the
end
of
the...
i
mean
that's
as
far
as
we
can
go,
isn't
it?
yeah.
justice
souter
yeah,
but
that...
is
that
why
we
took
this
case?
i
mean
didn't
we
take
the
case
to
determine
whether
you
were
entitled
to
something
on
the
record
that
you've
got?
justice
souter
i
mean,
i
think
you
want
to
make
a
different
case
for
us.
justice
souter
all
right,
and
we're
now
at
the
point
where
it
is
conceded
that
there
is
some
authority.
and
the
question
before
us
is
whether
your
proffer
entitles
you
to
some
kind
of
relief,
either
given
the
authority
that
has
been
conceded,
or
given
a
broader
authority
if
we
should
hold
that.
and
isn't
the
sort
of
immediate
question
before
us,
if
you
concede
that
the
proper
standard
is
that
the
court
can
look
behind
the
refusal
to
move,
if
the
refusal
amounts
to
a
constitutional
violation,
then
isn't
the
question
before
us
whether
you
have...
have
proffered
a
basis
to
look
behind
it?
if
all
you
say
is,
we
cooperated
and
they
haven't
moved
to
reduce,
isn't
that
the
exact
question
in
front
of
us?
justice
souter
well,
if
you
had
not
been
allowed
to
make
a
proffer
of
your
evidence,
you
know,
i...
i
would
probably
agree
with
you.
but
you
were
made...
you
were
allowed
to
do
it.
and
so
far
as
i
know,
the
only
thing
that
you
proffered,
in
effect,
was
that
your
client
had
agree...
your
client
had
cooperated,
there
had
been
no
plea
agreement
detailing
what
his
consequences
would
be,
and
the
government
has
simply
refused
to
move
for
a
downward...
move
for
a
reduction.
in
point
of
fact,
i
don't
think
you
have
suggested
to
us
that
you
really
have
anything
more
to
proffer.
a
minute
ago
you
said
you
weren't
claiming
bad
faith.
so
isn't
it
the
case...
given
the
fact
that
you
were
allowed
to
make
your
proffer...
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
only
issue
we
can
decide
is
whether
a
cooperation
and
a
refusal
are
sufficient
to
get
you
to
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
souter
well,
does...
is...
i
don't
think
we
should
go
outside
of
the
record,
but
let's
be
improper
for
a
moment.
are
you
claiming...
are
you
claiming
that,
in
fact,
there
was
an
agreement
that
was
broken
and
that's
what
the
bad
faith
consists
of?
that
you
did
have
a
plea
agreement?
justice
souter
well,
why
didn't
you
claim
that
when
you
were
in
front
of
the
court?
justice
souter
no,
but
i
mean
you
wanted
to
call
witnesses.
we
understand
that.
the
court
wouldn't
let
you
do
it.
why
didn't
you
say,
your
honor,
we
had
an
agreement.
and
they're
breaking
it.
why
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
souter
right,
and
we
shouldn't.
i
think
i
understand
your
position.
let
me
just
ask
a
final
question.
if
we
decide
the
case
on
the
record
before
us,
isn't
the
only
issue
before
us
whether
cooperation,
combined
with
no
government
motion
to
reduce,
gets
you
to
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
souter
isn't
that
the
only
issue
we
could
decide
on
this
record?
justice
souter
--do
you
take
the
position
that
arbitrariness
is
claimed,
if
you
simply
allege
that
there
has
been
cooperation
and
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
move
for
a
downward
reduction?
justice
souter
okay,
what
more
do
you
have?
justice
souter
okay.
well,
let's
be
practical
for
a
minute.
are
you
claiming
that
you
can
raise
the
issue
simply
by
a
naked
allegation
that
the
government
was...
was,
in
fact,
or
the
prosecutor
was,
in
fact,
motivated
by...
by
some
objective
unrelated
to
a
proper
governmental
function?
justice
souter
would
the
answer...
would
the
answer
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
government
made
it
plain
before
the
guilty
plea
that
it
was
not
going
to
honor
the
agreement?
justice
souter
so
if
the
government
says...
the
government
says
we're
not
going
to
honor
it,
no
problem
at
all.
if
the
government...
government
doesn't
say
we're
not
going
to
honor
it,
still
no
problem?
justice
souter
well,
is
it
induced
when
it's
not
made
part
of
the
formal
plea
agreement
at
the
time
the
plea
is
entered,
but
nonetheless
had
been
the
subject
of
an
informal
agreement
when
the
government
never
indicates
that
it's
going
to
renege
on
that
agreement?
is
that
inducing
it?
justice
souter
so
you're
just
saying
in
effect
that
that
the
plea
bargain
is
not
limited
to
a
formal
plea
bargain
immediately
preceding
the
entry
of
the
plea?
justice
souter
but
not
necessarily.
justice
souter
okay,
that
makes
it
clear.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
petitioner,
harold
ray
wade,
pleaded
guilty
to
federal
charges
of
drug
trafficking
and
gun
possession.
at
his
sentencing
hearing,
wade
argued
that
the
applicable
sentencing
statute
and
guideline
permitted
the
district
court
to
go
below
the
mandatory
10-year
sentence
for
his
conviction
on
the
drug
charges
because
after
his
arrest,
he
had
helped
the
government
catching
another
drug
dealer.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
no
authority
to
go
below
the
minimum
unless
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
that
effect.
because
the
government
had
not
filed
such
a
motion,
the
district
court's
sentence
weighed
to
10
years
in
prison
on
the
drug
charges.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
the
district
court
had
correctly
found
itself
without
authority
to
depart.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
rejected
wade's
argument
that
the
district
court
at
least
had
the
power
to
review
the
government's
refusal
to
file
a
motion
upon
a
claim
that
its
refusal
resulted
from
an
unconstitutional
motive.
we
agree
with
wade
that
the
district
court
has
authority
to
review
the
government's
decision
to
withhold
a
substantial
assistance
motion
when
a
defendant
makes
a
substantial
showing
that
the
refusal
reflected
an
unconstitutional
motive.
in
this
case,
however,
wade
failed
in
the
district
court
to
make
any
showing
of
unconstitutional
motive
even
though
the
district
court
gave
him
an
adequate
opportunity
for
doing
so.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
