justice
o'connor
well,
if
that's
true,
do
you
concede
that
defendants
have
a
protected
liberty
interest
sufficient
to
trigger
the
due
process
clause
in
having
one
of
these
motions
made?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
what
is
the
situation
if
the
government
promises
the
defendant
to
file
a
motion
under
this
section--
justice
o'connor
--and
induces
the
defendant's
cooperation,
and
then
reneges
on
filing
any
motion?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
relief
possible,
and
what?
justice
o'connor
no,
the
government
promises
that
if
you
will
cooperate
with
us,
i'll
make
a
motion
at
sentencing,
for
reduction.
and
the
defendant
does,
and
then
no
motion
is
made.
