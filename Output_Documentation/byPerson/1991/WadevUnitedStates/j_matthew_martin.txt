mr.
j.
matthew
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
good
morning.
the
issue
today
before
the
court
is
whether
the
district
judge
has
any
authority
to
consider
a
defendant's
substantial
assistance
outside
of
the
government's
refusal
to
make
a
motion
for
downward
departure.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
because
the
statutory
authority
gives
the
prosecutor
sole
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
file
a
motion
for
downward
departure
for
substantial
assistance,
that
neither
the
defendant
nor
the
court
may
inquire
into
the
government's
reasons
and
motives,
if
the
government
does
not
make
the
motion.
the
government
now
concedes
that
there
are
grounds
for
review
by
the
court
when
a
defendant
makes
a
threshold
showing
of
un...
unconstitutional
activity
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
only
uncontested
issues
before
the
court
today
are
what...
whether
the
scope
of
judicial
authority
includes
review
of
claims
for
bad
faith
or
arbitrariness
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
in
his
decision
making
process;
and
also,
what
circumstance...
what
the
circumstances
are
surrounding
the
remand
in
this
particular
case.
in
this
case--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--no,
your
honor,
they
don't.
what
happened
in
this
case
is
the
district
court
upheld
that
he
had
no
authority
to
entertain
this
inquiry,
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
i
did
make
a
brief
proffer
at
the
trial
court--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--basically,
the
proffer
consisted
of
a
recitation
of
what
mr.
wade's
assistance
was
up
to
that
point.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
not
at
that
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
judge
would
not
let
me
put
on
any
evidence--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
believe
that
would
be
correct.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
reverse.
if
you'd
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
and
you
can
see
that
what
judge
tilley,
the
district
court
judge
did,
was
deny
my
request...
not
once,
actually,
but
twice...
before
he
allowed
me
to
make
the
proffer.
so
actually,
he
had
ruled
on
this
before
he
said
you
may
state...
you
may
make
a
statement.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
the...
at
the
trial
court,
the
trial
judge
did
not
even
think
he
had
the
authority
to
get
to
the
point
of
making
a
proffer
where
he
could
hear
any
evidence.
he
says:
well,
i
believe
i'm
going
to--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--on
page
9
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
court
says,
and
i
quote:
well,
i
believe
i'm
going
to
let
you
make
some
law
with
that
case.
because
i
believe...
i
do
not
believe
so.
and
i
hold
that
i
do
not
have
that
authority.
you
may
appeal
that
belief
that
i
feel
that
i
am
imposing
this
sentence
contrary
to
law,
because
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
depart
upon
your
motion
for
substantial
assistance
for
a
mandatory
minimum.
he
did
not
believe
that
he
had
any
authority,
whatsoever,
to
entertain
any
kind
of
motion
with
regard
to
this.
and,
indeed,
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
him.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
i
do
not
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
i
was
not
allowed...
he
would...
you
can
see
on
the--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
it
was
a
very
strange
sentencing
proceeding.
the
parties
in
the
case
before
us,
your
honor,
had
raised
a
very
similar
type
of
request.
and
the
judge
was
very
short.
i
felt
like
the
judge
was
going
to
sentence
my
man
to
the
mandatory
minimum,
but
i
didn't
want
to
risk
his
ire.
the...
i
guess
the
point--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
i
did--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
that
is
true.
however,
there
is...
there
is
additional
evidence
that
is,
frankly,
just
not
a
part
of
the
record
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
i
did
not,
your
honor.
because--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
there...
there's
a...
you...
there's
a
point
in
here,
where,
on
page
10...
or
i
suppose
on
page
9
and
10...
where
i'm
going
through
this
with
the
court.
and
i
asked
the
court,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
me
to
put
on
evidence?
i
had
anticipated
being
able
to
put
the
special
agent
on,
so
that
he
could
discuss
the
contact
that
the
agent
had
with
the
defendant
and
the
inducements
that
were
made
to
mr.
wade
by
the
agents
of
the
prosecutor,
that
is,
the
drug
enforcement
administration
agency.
that
i
was
not
allowed
to
do.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
perhaps
not
in
my
proffer,
itself,
justice
kennedy,
but
in...
at
the
beginning
of
my
discussion
with
the
judge,
i
say
it
is
again
a
question
of
that,
as
opposed
to
the
prosecutorial
function.
i
was
trying
to
bring
this
up
with
him.
but
he
just
simply
refused
to...
he
actually
ruled
very
quickly
and
said--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
don't
necessarily
disagree
with
that
characterization,
mr.
chief
justice.
but...
i
suppose
the
only
way
i
can
say
that
is
that
this
is
a
court
that
i'm
extremely
familiar
with;
that
i
practice
in
every
month;
prosecutors
and
i
are,
you
know,
very
close.
and
so
in
my
mind,
at
the
time,
it
was
a
touchy
subject.
i
wanted...
and
we
still
do...
want
to
have
a
chance
to
make
the
showing
that
the
government
now
says
we
can
make.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
i'm
not
trying
to...
i'm
actually
not
trying
to
get
off
of
it.
what
mr.
wade
would
like
is
an
opportunity
to
make
the
showing
that
the
government
now
says
he
has
to
make.
please
remember
that--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
the--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--justice
souter,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
district
court
has
no
authority
to
entertain--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
the
question
before
the
court
is
did
the
district
court
have
any
authority...
if
the
parties
now
agree
that
the
district
court
did
have
the
authority,
i
think
the
question
then
is,
isn't
it
appropriate
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
and
say,
district
court
judge--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
don't
believe
so.
because
what...
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
really
doesn't
address
this
issue.
it
just
says
no
authority
whatsoever.
i
may
have
misspoke.
i
do
believe
we
do
have
an
allegation
of
bad
faith.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
not
in
my
proffer.
and
i
admit
that
that's
a
problem.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
no,
sir,
not
an
agreement
between...
no,
your
honor,
not
an
agreement
between
the
prosecutor
and
myself,
but
agreements
made
between
agents
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
uncounseled
defendant
on
the
night
he
was
arrested.
that
is
what
i
believe.
that
by
affidavit,
i
could
show
evidence
of
it.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
i
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
call
a
special
agent--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
can
do
to
explain
that
to
you
is
to
tell
you
that
i
felt
very
pressured
by
the
judge
to
move
on;
he
was
giving
me
clear
signals
that
he...
what
sentence
he
was
going
to
impose,
that
he
was
going
to
impose
the
minimum;
we
had
already
been...
i
don't
really
want
to
go
too
far
out
of
the
record...
but
we
had--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
do
not--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
if...
if
authority
exists,
whether
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
the
defendant
to
make...
to
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
threshold
showing.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
case,
on
remand,
could
proceed
directly
to
some
discovery-laden
adversarial
proceeding.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
looked
at
that
way.
but
i
think
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
is,
is
that
at
the
time,
this
judge
was
aware
of
precedent
in
the
fourth
circuit
which
was
against
me,
frankly.
the...
with
that
in
mind,
i
believe
that
really
the
question
is,
should
the
case
be
remanded?
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--your
honor,
the
authority
of
the
judge
was
foremost
in
his
mind.
it's
clear
from
the
long
colloquies
that
we
had.
assuming
that
he
has
authority...
i
suggest
to
you
that
that's
appropriate...
i
admit
to
you
that,
and
i
concede
that
there
are
problems
with
the
proffer
that
i
made
on
mr.
wade's
behalf
at
the
time.
however,
and
i
stress
to
you
again,
this
occurred
after
the
judge
had
already
ruled;
after
he
had
already
basically
cut
me
off.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
another
question
that
remains
is
whether
the
scope
of
review
in
these
circumstances
would
include
the
concepts
of
bad
faith
or
arbitrariness,
those
motivations
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
the
government
does
not
agree
with
us
with
regard
to
that.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
an
appropriate
scope
of
review
as
well,
in
these
cases.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
i
think
what
you
need
is
a
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
that
is
not
related
to
a
governmental
interest.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
cross
threshold
showing
that
the
government
agrees
now
must
be
made,
that
there
must
be
evidence
which
satisfies
the
court
that
these
conditions
exist,
by
way
of
a
supposed
proffer,
or
by
way
of
affidavits.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
a
defendant
can
walk
into
the
courtroom
and
call
the
prosecutor
to
the
witness
stand,
and
then
begin
essentially
cross-examining
him.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
if
the
unreasonableness
rises
to
the
level
of...
of
denying
the
defendant
his...
his
fundamental
rights
at
sentencing,
the
rights--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
i--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--and
i
believe
that
that's
basically
correct.
i
mean,
it's
almost--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
it
would
be
unreasonableness
coupled
with...
with
not
just...
not
just,
you
treated
this
defendant
this
way,
and
you
treated
this
defendant
the
other
way.
i
don't...
i
don't...
i
just
don't
believe
a
defendant
can
make
it
on
that.
what
i
think
we're
talking
about
is
a
very
narrow,
small
number
of
cases.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
or
bad
faith.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
that's--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i...
i
think
that's...
it's
almost
like
a
sort
of
a
sniff
test,
your
honor,
that
the
district--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i
believe
so.
the
district
judges
in
this
country
can...
are...
are
more
than
adequately
equipped
to
tell
when
someone
has
got
enough
to
cross
the
rubicon,
so
to
speak.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
what
we--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--based
upon
the
record
before
you,
i
have
not.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
and
i
admit
that.
what
we...
what
we
would
like
is
the
opportunity
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
make
the
showing
the
the
government
now
says,
is
now
agreeing,
that
a
defendant
can
make.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
because
i
believe
that
even
to
get
to
the
point
of
questioning
the
government's
motives,
a
defendant
must
establish,
as
i
believe
we
did
in
this
case,
must
establish
that
the
assistance
that
the
defendant
rendered
was
substantial.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--it's...
it's--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--that
is
really
not
our
position.
our
position
is
is
that
the
first
thing
the
defendant
must
do
is
have
performed
substantial
assistance
that
is
agreed
upon
as
substantial.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
mr.
wade's
assistance
in
this
case
was
of
val...
i
think
the
quote
is
of
valuable
assistance
to
the
government.
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
has
ever
disagreed
that
what
mr.
wade,
the
defense...
the
petitioner
did--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
no,
i
think
there
needs
to
be
one
more
step
beyond
that.
i
do
not
suggest
to
the
court
that
any
defendant
who
has
told
on
anyone,
can
walk
in
and
say,
your
honor,
my...
i
haven't
been
given
credit
for
what
i
did.
i
don't
make
that
suggestion
to
the
court
today.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
well,
questions...
questions
revolving
around
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
assistance
of
the
government,
i
believe
we've
agreed
with
the
government
that
those
questions
are
uniquely...
are
unique
questions
that
the
government,
in
its
own
wisdom,
can
decide
on.
what
we're
talking
about
is
when
the
government's
decision
regarding
a
defendant's
assistance
goes
beyond
the
sphere
of...
of
deciding
what
was
appropriate
that
that
particular
defendant
did.
in--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--the
amicus
in
our
case
takes
a
broader
perspective
on
this
issue
than
we
do.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
to
that
extent,
that
is
correct.
we
do.
but
i
think
it's
instructive
to
note
that
a
defendant
can,
in
a
sentencing,
in
the
sentencing
context,
when
there
is
a
guideline
range,
can
put
on
evidence
of
his
own
with
regard
to
what
assistance
was
made,
so
that
the
determination
can
be
made
where
to...
where
to
sentence
within
the
guideline
range.
important
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was
a
mandatory
minimum.
but
there
was,
i
think,
a
30-day
guideline
range.
but
nonetheless,
no
evidence
was
allowed
to
be
put
on.
i
think
because
the
district
court
just
was...
had
the
assumption
that
this...
there
was
no
review
of
the
government's
decision.
and--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--well,
your
honor,
the...
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
that
question
is
when
congress
created
this
provision,
it
gave
this
discretion
to
the
government.
the
government
cannot
exercise
that
discretion
in
an
improper
way.
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
there
can
be
review.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
at
the...
at
the...
at...
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that.
because
that
occurs
at
the
earliest
stages
of
the
invocation
of
judicial
power.
sentencing
occurs
at
the
very
end.
i
think
that's
the
difference.
i
think
they're
analogous,
but
i,
you
know,
i
believe
that
that
is
the
difference
in
the
case.
there's
a...
there
are
circumstances
when,
unfortunately,
improper
things
occur.
there's
a
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
from
february
the
5th,
wherein
the
judge
noticed
that
the
prosecutor,
the
redondo
lemos
case,
where
the
prosecutor
was
favoring
female
defendants
over
male
defendants
in
making...
on
motions
for
substantial
assistance.
so
i
think
that's...
that,
alone,
is
reason
enough
for
there
to
be
reviewability
in
the
case.
the
fourth
circuit
felt
otherwise.
and
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
respond
to
a
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked
mr.
long,
with
regard
to
what
happens
in
the
situations
where
assistance
is
provided
right
up
front,
which
is
clear
from
the
record
what
happened
in
this
situation,
i
think
that
it's...
that
it's
appropriate
to
note
that
those...
that
that
type
of
cooperation,
and
whatever
is
said
to
bring
that
about,
is
known
by
the
prosecutor
at
the
time
later
his
decision-making
process
goes
into
effect.
quite
often...
i
would
say,
in
fact,
virtually
every
time...
that
type
of
situation
occurs,
the
defendant
is
uncounseled,
and
is
there
on
his
own
at
that
point.
i
believe
that
this
sentencing
reform
act--
mr.
j.
matthew
martin
--i...
i...
i
believe
that
it's
clear
from
the
record
and
from
the
court
of
appeals
brief
that
immediately
upon
his
arrest,
he
made
this
cooperation.
and
additionally,
in
the
record
that
the
court
has,
it
notes
when
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him,
which
was
sometime
after
that.
i
guess
you
can
infer
that
there
were
no
other
attorneys.
but
in
the
record
you
will
see
where
i
was
appointed,
on
october
30.
i
was
certainly
not
appointed
to
represent
the
petitioner
when
he
was
arrested.
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
is
to
reverse
the
fourth
circuit
and
hold
that
there
are
circumstances
that...
wherein
the
district
court
may
inquire
into
the
government's
reasons
for
denying
the
substantial
assistance
motion,
and
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
in
that
context,
to
allow
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
make
a
threshold
showing.
thank
you.
