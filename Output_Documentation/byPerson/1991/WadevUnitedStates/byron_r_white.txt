what's
that?
what
is
bad
faith?
what
would
you
say?
justice
white
i
mean
is...
they're
so
wrong,
they're
obviously
in
bad
faith?
justice
white
you
know
it
when
you
see
it?
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
what
if
we...
what
if
we
said
that,
well,
the
court
of
appeals
is
obviously
wrong
if
it
said
that
the
government's...
the
government's
decision
is
never
reviewable;
and
we
said
it's
reviewable
if
there's
a...
if
there's
a
con...
if
the
government
violated
a
constitutional...
it
looks
like
the
government
violated
a
constitutional
right.
but
we
went
no
farther,
and
said
but
not
for
any
other
reason.
you
don't
claim
that
there's
any
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
you
made
no
claim
of
it,
and
you
don't
claim
now,
i
take
it,
that
there
was...
that
the
prosecutor
was
violating
the
constitution
in
refusing
this
motion?
justice
white
do
you
or
not?
justice
white
well,
do
you
defend
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
its
face?
justice
white
so
that
the
court
was
just
wrong
in
saying
under
no
circumstances,
without
a
motion,
does
the
court
have
power
to
go
downward?
justice
white
well,
it
did
say
under...
they
just
said
across
the
board,
without
the
motion
of
the
statute,
isn't
satisfied.
justice
white
and
that's
the
end
of
the
story.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
isn't
that
what
they
said?
justice
white
and
you
don't
agree
with
that?
justice
white
and
how...
when
is
the...
when
is
the
government's
decision
not
to
file
a
motion
reviewable?
justice
white
is
that
the...
is
that
the
only...
is
that
the
limit
of
the
reviewability?
justice
white
bad
faith
is...
i
don't
know
what
bad
faith,
particularly
is.
but
you
wouldn't
say
bad...
an
allegation
of
bad
faith
would
entitle
you
to
a
hearing?
