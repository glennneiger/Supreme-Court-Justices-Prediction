justice
stevens
mr.
agee,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
because
i
must
confess
i
am
having
a
little
difficulty
following
the
argument.
as
i
understood
the
court
of
appeals,
they
analyzed
the
case
under
541(c)(2)
and
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
522.
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
and
am
i
also
correct
that
your
argument
based
on
this
(d)(2),
whatever,
relates
solely
to
522?
justice
stevens
could
i
back
up
just
a
second
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
541(c)(2)
says
that
a
restriction
on
the
transfer
of
beneficial
interest
to
the
debtor
and
the
trust
that
is
enforceable
under
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
is
enforceable
in
a
case
until
this
title.
are
you
contending
that
erisa
is
not
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law?
justice
stevens
but
i
didn't
understand
you
had
made
that
argument
yet,
and
that
is
the
argument
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
and
disagreed
with.
justice
stevens
now,
why
are
they
wrong?
justice
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
again?
why
wouldn't
your
argument
about
making
the
reasonable
needs
thing
superfluous
apply
also
to
a
state
law
of
spendthrift
trust,
because
there
you
had
no
reasonable
needs
limitation
if
it
qualifies
as
spendthrift
trust
under
state
law.
justice
stevens
exactly.
