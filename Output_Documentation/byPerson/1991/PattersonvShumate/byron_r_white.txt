justice

what
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything
before
us?
justice
white
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
entitlement
of
the
beneficiary?
justice
white
but
this
section
applies
to
all
pension
plans
or
not?
justice
white
yes,
but
it
would
apply
to,
not
just
erisa
pension
plans,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
but
if
it
is
an
erisa
plan
you
have
a
provision
in
erisa
plans
that
may
not
be
present
in
other
plans,
namely,
that
it
is
not
subject
to
attachment.
justice
white
well,
on
your
provision
you
are
writing
out
of
the
code,
erisa
as
a
nonbankruptcy
applicable
law.
justice
white
so
you
say,
to
g
these
two
sections
you
have
to
just
say
that
erisa
is
not
an
nonbankruptcy
law...
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law.
justice
white
because
congress
has
specifically
dealt
with
the
issue
in
another
section?
justice
white
what
kind
of
a
nonbankruptcy
law
would...
what
kind
of
an
law
would
be
an
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law?
justice
white
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law.
justice
white
a
lot
of
erisa
plans
are
pension
plans,
aren't
they?
justice
white
well,
522
speaks
of
pension
plans
and
it
says
how
much
of
it
can
be
exempted.
and
how
do
you...
why
do
you
exclude
erisa
plans
from
that
provision?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
my
question
is,
why
doesn't
an
erisa
plan
fall
under
522(d),
where
it
says...
where
it
limits
the
amount
of
a
pension
plan
that
is
exempt
from
administration?
justice
white
that
seems
to
me
the
whole
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
law
is
to
collect
assets
that
have
never
been
collected
before
and
protective
and
made
available
to
creditors.
and
if
you
exemptions
that
operate
outside
of
bankruptcy,
by
virtue
of
state
law,
don't
those
same
exemptions
continue
to
operate
in
bankruptcy
even
though
it
is
a
part
of
the
estate?
justice
white
but
property
is
just
treated
differently
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
than
it
is
outside
of
bankruptcy.
