well,
it
might
be
of
limited
significance,
but
it's
still
the
case
that
there
is
not
a
complete
identity
of
the
subjects
to
which
the
exclusion
and
the
exemption
apply.
so
you
cannot...
i
take
you
agree,
you
cannot
make
the
argument
that
the
one
is
rendered
sort
of
totally
useless
by
the
other.
justice
souter
that
may
be
written
out
with
respect
to
the
erisa
plans,
but
there
are
still
going
to
be
plans
covered
by
the
exemption
that
are
not
covered
by
the
exclusion;
isn't
that
correct?
