mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
of
my
main
points
have
been
made
by
the
court
and
so
let
me
try
to
deal
with
them
very
briefly.
first,
i
think
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
linchpin
of
the
bankruptcy
trustee's
position
is
that
erisa
is
not
an
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law.
but
it
certainly
would
seem
on
the
face
of
those
words
that
erisa
is
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law.
indeed,
the
fifth
circuit,
which
ruled
contrary
to
our
position
in
goff,
acknowledged
the
facially
broad
language
of
the
statute
and
went
on
not
to
follow
the
facially
broad
language
of
the
statute
because
it
felt
that
the
legislative
history
suggested
that
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
was
limited
to
state
spendthrift
trust
law.
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
proper
way
to
read
the
statute.
applicable
nonbankruptcy
would
seem
to
cover
erisa.
if
that
is
so,
then
in
those
cases
where
a
pension
plan
has
an
anti-alienation
provision,
mandated
by
erisa,
then
the
benefits
are
excluded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
under
the
plain
language
of
the
exclusion
provision.
the
second
point
that
has
also
been
made
is
that
the
exemption
provisions
are
not
contrary
to
the
straightforward
reading
that
i
have
just
tried
to
give
to
the
exclusion
provision.
the
exemption
provision
that
petitioner
has
focused
on
today
is
the
522(d)(10)(e)
provision
which
discusses
pension
plans.
the
court
seems
to
understand
clearly
two
points
about
this.
first,
that
provision
covers
all
sorts
of
pension
plans,
not
just
pension
plans
that
qualify
for
tax
benefits
under
erisa.
if
a...
those
sorts
of
pension
plans,
those
that
aren't
qualified
under
erisa,
of
course,
do
not
contain
an
erisa-mandated
anti-alienation
provision.
and
in
cases
involving
such
benefits,
they
would
not
necessarily
be
excluded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
and
therefore
might
be
subject
to
exemption
under
522(d).
let
me
add
that
there
are
three
significant
categories
of
pension
plans
that
qualify
for
tax
benefits
under
erisa,
and
yet
are
not
required
by
the
statute
to
have
an
anti-alienation
provision.
and
those
are
governmental
pension
plans,
church
pension
plans
and
individual
retirement
accounts.
again,
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
those
plans
are
not
necessarily
excluded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate.
interests
in
such
plans
would
only
be
excluded
if
they
happen
to
qualify
under
state
spendthrift
trust
law,
but
interest
in
such
plans
are
subject
to
exemption
under
section
522(d)(10)(e).
and
without
section
522(d)(10)(e),
interest
in
such
plans
might
be
totally
distributed
to
creditors
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
so
section
522(d)(10)(e)
serves
the
very
important
function,
in
cases
involving
individual
retirement
accounts,
governmental
plans
and
church
plans,
of
protecting
pension
assets
to
the
extent
reasonably
necessary
to
the
creditor's
fresh
start.
if
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
is
read
to
include
erisa,
then
the
statutes
harmonize
and
the
anti-alienation
provision
is
given
its
full
force.
if
it
is
read
in
the
restrictive
manner
that
petitioner
proposes
there
is
a
real
clash.
the
anti-alienation
provision
is
not
given
its
force.
we
contend
that
it
would
be
doubly
erroneous
to
read
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
not
in
a
straightforward
manner
in
order
to
induce
a
clash
between
two
statutes.
it
should
be
read
straightforwardly
to
harmonize
the
statutes.
many
federal
agencies
are,
of
course,
frequently
creditors
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
we
considered
that
carefully
and
concluded,
nevertheless,
that
the
language
of
erisa
and
the
language
of
the
bankruptcy
code
compel
the
conclusion
that
pension
benefits,
protected
by
erisa's
mandatory
anti-alienation
provision
may
not
be
distributed
to
creditors,
either
in
or
outside
of
bankruptcy,
and
that
is
our
submission
to
this
court.
