mr.
g.
steven
agee
it
is
agee,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
disposition
in
bankruptcy
of
a
debtor's
interest
in
an
erisa
qualified
pension
plan
which
has
terminated.
the
erisa
policy
of
safeguarding
benefits
in
a
participant's
plan
crosses
with
the
bankruptcy
policy
of
marshalling
all
of
a
debtor's
assets
for
the
payment
of
creditors
in
return
for
a
fresh
start.
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy's
position
is
that
the
erisa
benefit
is
included
as
an
asset
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
subject
to
any
exemption
that
exists
under
the
code.
if
this
is
the
law,
what
are
the
public
policy
results
of
it?
would
there
be
multitudes
left
destitute
by
attachment
of
the
pension
interest
in
bankruptcy?
would
pension
plans
be
cancelled
or
a
pension
plan
administration
made
untenable,
and
would
there
be
an
improper
change
to
the
uniformity
of
application
of
erisa
rules?
i
would
submit
that
the
answer
to
those
questions
is
no.
most
plan
participants
would
not
be
affected
in
the
event
that
the
erisa
plan
benefit
were
included
as
part
of
their
estate
should
they
take
bankruptcy.
the
first
ground
of
defense
in
that
case
would
be
the
spendthrift-type
protection
that
exists
in
an
erisa
plan
by
reason
of
erisa's
requirement
that
every
plan
have
an
anti-alienation
protection.
for
instance,
if
you,
whether
you
worked
on
the
line
for
ford
motor
company
or
were
the
chief
executive
officer,
your
ability
to
control
the
distribution
out
of
the
pension
for
your
benefit
the
day
before
you
filed
bankruptcy
would
be
extremely
limited,
if
existing
at
all.
as
with
the
coleman
furniture
corporation
case,
if
someone
worked
on
the
line
building
chairs
for
coleman
furniture
corporation
they
would
have
no
control
over
the
plan.
they
would
have
no
access
to
be
able
to
get
any
benefits
out
of
the
plan.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
what
that
has
to
do
with
is
establishing
that
plan
participants
have
very
little
exposure,
by
and
large,
if
the
interest
of
their--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--it
protects
the
entitlement
of
the
beneficiary.
let
me
go
directly,
in
answer
to
that
question,
to
the
legal
argument
with
respect
to
an
exclusion
and
an
exemption
out
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
congress
has
only
apparently
spoken
one
time
directly,
either
in
erisa
or
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
to
when
an
exemption
for
an
erisa
benefit
would
exist.
in
the
exemption
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code
congress
specifically
said
that
the
debtor's
interest
in
a
pension
plan,
qualified
under
section
401(a)
would
be
exempt,
limited
to
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
debtor.
that
establishes
an
exemption
in
bankruptcy
which
could
not
exist
if
the
interest
in
the
erisa
plan
is
first
excluded
from
the
estate
under
section
541(c)(2)
of
the
code.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
section
522?
section
522
makes
a
division
into
two
different
categories.
in,
for
distance,
the
district
of
columbia,
which
is
a
non-opt-out
state,
it
uses
the
federal
exemptions.
in
opt-out
states
such
as
virginia,
which
is
the
majority
of
states,
they
do
not
have
this
reasonable
needs
of
the
debtor
limitation.
however,
if
there
exists--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--that...
that's
correct.
522--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct.
and
i
would
say
that
the
key
point
that
comes
out
that
is
that
if
there
is
first
an
exclusion
out
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
by
virtue
of
the
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
language
in
section
541(c)(2),
then
you
would
never
be
able
to
get
to
the
exemption
provision.
that
would
in
effect
write
out
of
the
code
in
the
non-opt-out
states
the
provision
that
limits
to
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
debtor
the
exemption
under
erisa.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
that's
correct,
in
a
sense,
mr.
justice
white,
for
two
reasons.
one,
if
you
attribute
to
the
language
in
522(d)(10)(e)
the
plain
meaning
that
congress
has
written
in
that
there
is
to
be
an
exemption
limited
to
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
debtor,
you
write
out
effectively
an
exclusion,
if
it
were
to
exist
under
541(c)(2).
otherwise,
that
serves
no
function.
that
is
true
there
are
church
plans
and
some
government
plans
that
would
still
function
under
this
section
522(d).
however,
the
reasonable
needs
limitation
would
be
written
out.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
in
my
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--that's
correct,
page
60a
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
the
bankruptcy
trustee
would
be
able
to
access,
if
the
erisa
benefit
is
included
as
part
of
the
estate,
only
that
to
which
the
debtor
could
have
accessed.
if
there
was
no
ability
of
the
debtor
to
get
into
the
plan
at
the
time
they
filed
bankruptcy,
to
take
something
out,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
could
accede
to
no
greater
right
than
the
debtor
had.
that
is
another
reason
that
i
believe
that
the
inclusion
in
the
estate
of
the
erisa
benefit
would
be
of
limited
significance
to
most
participants
in
most
plans.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
mr.
justice
souter,
i
do
to
this
extent:
that
if
you
conclude
first
that
there
is
an
omnibus
exclusion
of
erisa
benefits
under
541(c)(2),
using
that
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
language,
then
if
you
came
to
the
exemption
section,
the
only
place
where
the
congress
apparently
has
said
explicitly,
this
is
where
we
are
dealing
with
an
erisa
benefit,
and
it
has
placed,
at
least
in
the
non-opt-out
states,
a
limitation
to
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
debtor,
i
submit
that
that
is
written
out
of
the
code
because
you
have
created
first
an
omnibus--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--that
is
correct.
there
are
some
plans
that
would
be
covered.
when
the
drafting
was
done
on
section
522(d),
the
commission
on
the
bankruptcy
laws--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--522(d),
i
think
will
be,
as
cited
in
my
brief--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--that
would
be
page
3.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
but
if
there
is
an
inclusion
of
the
erisa
benefit
where
the
actual
trust
protection
of
the
plan
doesn't
cover
it
for
some
reason,
or
if
the
bankruptcy
trustee
was
able
to
access
an
asset
that
the
debtor
could
actually
reach
into
the
plan
and
take
out,
there
would
still
remain
the
exemptions
available
in
bankruptcy
under
section
522(d).
i
would
submit
that
plan
administration
would
not
be
affected
to
any
significant
degree
because
the
processing
of
many,
many
qualified
domestic
relations
orders
would
be
no
different
than
the
processing
of
the
bankruptcy
order
to
pay
out
part
of
the
pension
plan.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
no,
mr.
justice
stevens.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
this
522(d),
the
exemption
provision,
has
congress
writing,
for
the
only
time,
either
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
erisa,
how
will
we
treat
erisa
benefits
in
bankruptcy?
mr.
g.
steven
agee
well,
it
refers
to,
on
page
4,
three
triple
i's,
plans...
it's
done
in
the
negative,
but
plans
to
qualify
under
section
401(a).
and
that
is
erisa.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
no,
that
would
include
other
types
of
plans
including
government
plans.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
well,
i
hope
that
it
doesn't.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
because
if
you
are
going
to
accord
plain
meaning
to
this
particular
section,
then
reasonable
needs
limitations
for
private
plans,
pension
plans,
stock
bonus
plans,
profit-sharing
plans,
that's
gone.
and
when
this
section
was
drafted,
placed
into
the
code,
the
bankruptcy
commissioners'
report
was
very
specific
in
what
they
wanted
to
get
at
here.
they
were
to
exempt
the
private
employer
plans
and
the
reason
that
the
reasonable
needs
limitation
was
put
in
there
was
that
in
recognition,
as
here,
that
there
would
be
substantial
benefits
held
by
corporate
officers
and
by
members
of
professional
corporations.
that
is
exactly
what
i
think
the
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
in
this
provision.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
it
would
still
make
sense
as
long
as...
if
you
read
out
522(d)
the
coverage
for
pension
plans,
stock
bonus
plans
and
profit-sharing
plans,
which
would
be
private
plans.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
and
i
don't
think
the
congress
would
have
intended
that
if
they
would
have
included
that
language
in
the
statute.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
it
would...
that's
correct.
it
would
still
continue
to
cover
a
government
plan
and
a
state
plan.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
there
is
another
issue
here
in
dealing
in
particular
with
the
exemption
question
which
differentiates
this
particular
case
from
other
cases
the
court
has
heard
before.
when
there
have
been
garnishment
or
levy
statutes,
state
statutes
which
have
attempted
to
reach
into
a
pension
plan
and
take
something
out,
they
have
been
preempted
by
that
language
in
erisa,
section
514(a)
which
preempts
state
law.
but
erisa
also
includes
another
section
that
some
would
call
a
federal
preemption
statute
which
does
not
say
that
erisa
overrides
other
federal
law,
but
it
says
that
erisa
will
not
impair,
invalidate
or
supersede
other
federal
law.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
bankruptcy
code
entering
the
picture
fits
into
that
circumstance,
that
if
the
all
inclusive
scope
of
section
541
of
the
code,
which
is
to
include
all
of
the
debtor's
legal
and
equitable
interests
in
property,
are
brought
into
the
code,
that
if
the
anti-alienation
provision
of
erisa
overrides
it,
then
it
has
impaired,
superseded
and
certainly
modified
the
all-inclusive
scope
of
property
that
was
intended
to
be
included
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
if
you
do
reach
the
supposition
that
there
is
not
an
exclusion
of
erisa
benefits
from
the
bankruptcy
estate,
there
would
still
remain
the
question
under
section
522
as
to
what
kind
of
an
exemption
exists
if
any
in
an
opt-out
state.
the
bankruptcy
trustee's
position
that
there
is,
there
is...
there
are
exemptions
but
that
they
are
limited
to
the
exemptions
created
by
state
law.
erisa
is--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--i
do,
mr.
justice
stevens,
for
several
reasons.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
there
are
several
reasons.
the
first
is
this
articulation
that
i
attempted
to
make
that
says
the
congress
has
dealt
with
erisa
benefits
as
a
matter
of
exemption
over
here
in
522(d),
and
they
put
this
reasonable
needs
limitation
in
here.
so
if
you
say
first
under
541(c)(2)
that
you
exclude
all
the
benefits,
then
with
respect
to
the
private
employer
plans,
which
are
the
prime
focus
of
the
exemption
section...
not
the
exclusive,
but
a
primary...
that
the
reasonable
needs
limitation
isn't
going
to
be
there
for
any
of
those
erisa
benefits,
a
plain
meaning
type
argument.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
in
this
particular
section--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--that
is
the
primary
argument,
justice
white.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
in
that
section,
541(c)(2),
the
argument
has
been
made
in
all
the
other
lower
courts
that
the
law...
the
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
is
limited
to
state
law
in
that
section.
there
are
other
sections
in
the
bankruptcy
code
where
that
term
means
both
state
and
federal
law,
but
under
the
two--
mr.
g.
steven
agee
--if
it
qualifies...
if
you
accept
the
bankruptcy
trustee's
argument
that
state
law
is
applicable
to
nonbankruptcy
law
only
here
and
the
spendthrift
trust
protection
applies,
then
it
has
taken
the
property
out
of
the
estate
by
this
specific
statutory
exclusion
before
you
get
to
the
exemption
provision.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
section,
the
discussion
is
on
the
continuing
over
of
the
pre-code
practice
of
honoring
spendthrift
trust
protection
under
state
law.
there
are...
the
two
most
closely
related
sections
in
the
bankruptcy
code
to
this
one
which
are
541(c)(1)
that
deals
with
what
laws
interfere
with
inclusion
of
property
in
the
estate,
and
522(b)(2)(b),
which
is
tenants
by
the
entirety
property.
the
phrase,
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
is
limited
to
state
law
in
those
cases,
the
two
most
closely
related.
so
with
that
degree
of
difference
between
the
statutes,
i
think
it
is
legitimate
to
look
beyond
it
into
the
legislative
history
to
see
this
indication
toward
state
law.
but
if
erisa
then
boils
down
to
a
question
of
exemption,
the
question
in
the
non-opt-out
state
is
settled,
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
debtor.
but
in
the
states
that
don't
opt
out,
would
it
exist
as
a
federal
exemption?
the
legislative
history
again
of
that
section
makes
no
mention
of
erisa
as
an
exemption.
and
in
addition,
erisa
is
addressed
by
statutory
reference
directly
in
the
non-opt-out
section,
522(d),
but
not
addressed
in
the
opt-out
section,
which
is
522(b)(2)(a).
it
also
points
out
the
difference
in
the
type
of
anti-alienation
protection
that
erisa
provides
if
you
compare
it
i
think
with
just
about
any
other
federal
protection
statute:
social
security,
civil
service,
foreign
service
benefits.
those
statutes
provide
a
direct
prohibition
on
any
type
of
alienation,
garnishment
or
levy.
erisa,
though,
provides
a
derivative
type
protection.
it
doesn't
say
these
assets
shall
not
be
garnished.
it
provides
that
the
erisa
plan
must
contain
a
provision
that
prohibits
alienation,
and
that
is
successful
in
the
nonbankruptcy
context
because
of
the
state
preemption
provision
in
erisa
where
erisa
overrides
all
of
the
state
laws.
but
with
the
provision
in
erisa
that
says
it
will
not
impair
or
supersede
another
federal
statute,
then
i
think
that,
pointing
up
the
difference
in
the
type
of
exemption
erisa
puts
out,
is
authority
for
there
being
no
federal
exemption
under
522.
the
exemption
provisions
in
the
bankruptcy
code
are
essentially
state-based
exemptions.
if
the
congress
had
wanted
to
do
otherwise,
then
522(d)
would
be
the
only
provision
there.
that
is
why,
for
instance,
virginia
has
a
$5,000
homestead
exemption
and
texas
has
a
virtually
unlimited
exemption.
lastly,
i
would
add
a
word
about
the
rule
that
the
court
has
discussed
in
dewsnup
v.
timm
extending
the
midatlantic
national
bank
case.
in
those
cases
where
there
is
a
pre-code
practice,
unless
it
is
set
aside
by
specific
language
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
or
by
the
legislative
history,
that
practice
carries
over
post-code.
there
was
a
pre-code,
and
in
fact,
in
some
cases,
post-erisa
practice
that
included
assets
from
a
plan
which
were
in
pay
status
such
as
we
have
here
from
a
terminated
plan
prior
to
the
time
that
chapter
7
proceedings
began.
this
practice
is
not
negated
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
even
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history,
and
i
will
submit
that
that
practice
carries
over
under
the
rule
from
the
dewsnup
and
midatlantic
cases.
the
inclusion
of
the
erisa
benefits
would
cover
comparatively
few
participants
but
it
would
cover
those
who
have
the
ability
to
access
plan
assets
the
day
before
they
file
bankruptcy.
and
i
would
submit,
if
the
policy
consideration
is
that
we
want
to
protect
this
stream
of
income,
if
the
debtor
has
the
ability
to
take
it
out,
he
can
just
as
easily
go
to
mexico
with
it
as
he
can,
use
it
for
any
type
of
retirement
benefit.
there
is
no
restriction
on
it,
if
the
debtor
can
get
that
property
out
before
he
files
for
bankruptcy.
that's
what
this
case
would
cover.
and
i
would
also
submit,
it
does
harmonize
the
federal
exemption
provision
and
the
erisa
federal
preemption
provision
by
including
the
asset
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
and
it
honors
the
pre-code
practice
of
including
in
a
bankruptcy
estate
those
assets
which
are
in
pay
status
at
the
time
that
the
debtor
files
for
bankruptcy.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
steven
agee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
only
three
points
in
rebuttal.
with
respect
to
the
guidry
case,
the
first
major
distinction
of
guidry
is
of
course
that
it
was
not
a
bankruptcy
case.
unlike
a
lot
of
previous
decisions
that
dealt
with
the
application
of
erisa
protecting
benefits
from
state
law
claims,
guidry
did
involve
another
federal
statute.
but
the
point
of
distinction,
as
i
recall
the
course
of
opinion,
was
that
the
statute
in
effect
there,
the
labor
management
relations
act,
had
its
own
savings
clause,
its
own
preemption
provision
that
said
it
would
not
interfere
with
another
federal
law.
and
the
court
concluded,
in
effect,
that
the
erisa
provision
that
says
it
will
not
modify
or
impair
other
federal
law,
the
two
trumped
each
other
and
therefore
erisa
could
prevail
over
the
labor
management
relations
act.
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
similar
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
code
and
there
is
no
exception
in
erisa
or
anywhere
else
that
i
am
aware
of,
from
this
federal
preemption
provision
within
erisa
itself
that
would
make
the
bankruptcy
code
subservient
to
erisa
in
that
circumstance.
there
is
some
discussion
of
the
concept
of
the
fresh
start,
which
is
an
important
part
of
the
bankruptcy
codes
provisions.
but
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
submit
that
the
fresh
start
is
not
at
all
what
was
anticipated
in
drafting
the
bankruptcy
code
where
you
have
an
exemption
for
the
tools
of
the
trade,
some
small
exemption
for
household
goods,
things
of
that
nature.
because
in
this
case,
if
the
decision
is
in
favor
of
the
debtor,
the
debtor
simply
goes
to
the
clerk's
office,
takes
his
check,
can
get
on
the
first
plane
if
he
or
she
chooses
to
do
so
and
they
are
gone
to
mexico.
they
can
spend
the
entire
proceeds
in
the
gaming
house
the
very
first
day
that
they
are
gone.
there
is
no
requirement,
there
is
no
protection
of
the
stream
of
income
for
retirement
purposes
in
this
particular
case.
and
lastly,
to
speak
about
the
harmonization
of
the
various
code
sections,
this
provision
within
erisa
that
says
it
will
not
supersede
or
impair
other
federal
law
functions
like
the
all-inclusive
scope
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
under
section
541
is
harmonized
with
this
reasonable
needs
exemption
in
section
522
that
deals
with
those
exemptions.
so
i
submit
there
is
a
harmonization
by
reading
the
code
as
the
bankruptcy
trustee
suggests.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
to
honor
the
plain
meaning
of
this
reasonable
needs
exemption
in
bankruptcy
under
522,
there
should
be
no
exclusion
from
the
estate
under
541(c)(2)
and
that
the
bankruptcy
code's
preexisting
practice
dealing
with
benefits
that
are
prepared
for
distribution
and
ready
for
payment
when
the
debtor
enters
into
bankruptcy
proceedings
should
carry
over,
post-code
and
apply
in
this
case.
i
thank
the
court.
