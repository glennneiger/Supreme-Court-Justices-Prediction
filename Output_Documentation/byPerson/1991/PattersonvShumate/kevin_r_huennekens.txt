mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
shumate's
interest
in
the
coleman
furniture
company
pension
plan
should
be
excluded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
is
required
by
the
plain
meaning
of
section
541(c)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
second,
no
judicial
exception
should
be
made
to
the
considered
congressional
policy
choice
that
this
court
recognized
in
guidry
for
beneficiaries
who
file
bankruptcy.
and
third,
property
interests
should
be
treated
the
same
whether
a
debtor
is
in
bankruptcy
or
outside
of
bankruptcy.
turning
to
the
first
reason,
the
plain
meaning.
the
language
of
541(c)(2)
says
that
where
a
trust
contains
an
enforceable
restriction
on
the
transfer
of
a
beneficial
interest
that
is
enforceable
under
applicable
bankruptcy
law,
the
restrictions
recognized
in
bankruptcy
and
operates
to
exclude
that
interest
from
assets
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law,
yes,
your
honor.
certainly,
erisa
qualifies
as
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
the
reason,
mr.
justice
white,
that
erisa
plans
exclude
from
541(c)(2)
is
because
erisa
requires
that
qualified
plans,
the
pension
plan,
the
assets
be
held
in
a
trust.
it
also
requires
that
the
trust
impose
a
restriction
on
the
transfer
of
a
beneficiary's
interest
in
the
trust.
so
for
those
two
reasons
it
qualifies
as--
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
--there
may
very
well
be
a
slight
overlap
between
the
two
provisions,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
fatal.
section
522
deals
with...
522(d)(10)(e)
deals
with
many
different
kinds
of
pension
plans
and
in
addition
to
pension
plans,
deals
with
profit-sharing
plans
and
other
types
of
interest
such
as
stock
bonus
plans.
it
also
would
cover
unqualified
plans,
such
as
a
deferred
compensation
plan.
so
the
universe
covered
by
522(d)(10)
is
very
different
from
the
restriction
in
541(c)(2)
which
covers
only
a
small
majority...
minority
of
these
plans
which
is
the
erisa-qualified
plan.
and
then
to
get
to
the
section
(iii),
which
covers
a
restriction
for
insiders,
basically,
when
a
plan
is
established
that
says,
well,
for
them,
under
section
522,
only
plans
that
qualify
under
these
certain
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code
can
be
exempted.
again,
there
are
many
types
of
plans
that
are
included
within
that
provision.
for
instance,
ira's
would
be
included,
an
individual
retirement
account,
which
is
not
an
erisa-qualified
plan.
also
included,
as
petitioner
mentions,
would
be
the
church
plans
and
government
plans
which
are
erisa-qualified
plans
that
do
not
contain
an
anti-alienation
provision.
so
the
exemption
would
be
necessary
because
those
assets
are
not
held
in
a
trust
and
are
not
subject
to
the
exclusion
of
section
541(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
turning
back
to
the
plain
meaning
of
section
541,
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
suggests
that
section
541(c)(2)
was
meant
to
refer
only
to
state
spendthrift
trust
law
as
the
petitioner
suggests.
there...
the
term,
applicable
nonbankruptcy
law
is
intentionally
broad
and
it
is
unqualified
on
its
face.
in
other
portions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
same
term
is
used,
and
in
each
occurrence
it
refers
to
both
federal
law
and
state
law
and
not
simply
to
state
law.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
mr.
chief
justice,
they
have
not
been
definitively
construed.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
number
of
occurrences...
and
the
fourth
circuit
set
forth
a
number
of
occurrences
where
the
phrase
was
used
throughout
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
in
each
one
of
those
circumstances,
the
fourth
circuit
observed
that
it
was
referring
to
both
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
from
the
context
within
which
the
language
was
used
in
a
particular
place,
for
instance,
referring
to
the
securities
laws,
referring
to
copyright
law,
those
types
of
references,
obviously
incorporating
federal
law
as
well
as
state
law.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
courts
must
presume
that
a
legislature
says
in
its
statute
what
it
means.
when
the
language
is
unambiguous,
judicial
inquiry
is
complete.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
basis,
no
reason
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
as
petitioner
argues.
but
even
if
the
court
were,
the
legislative
does
nothing
more
than
suggest
that
congress
intended
for
spendthrift
trust
law
to
be
included
within
the
scope
of
541(c)(2).
it
certainly
doesn't
suggest
anywhere
that
erisa
was
meant
to
be
excluded
from
it.
the
second
reason
is
that
as
this
court
recognized
in
guidry,
the
anti-alienation
provision
in
erisa
reflects
a
considered
congressional
policy
choice.
that
decision
was
to
safeguard
a
stream
of
income
for
pensioners,
and
even
if
that
decision,
this
court
wrote,
prevents
others
from
securing
relief
for
wrongs
done.
if
exceptions
are
to
be
made,
this
court
wrote,
it
is
for
congress
to
make
them.
no
exceptions
should
be
made
here
for
a
debtor
who
files
bankruptcy.
indeed,
if
employee
malfeasance
and
criminal
misconduct
did
not
justify
the
creation
of
an
exemption,
the
mere
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition
should
not.
furthermore,
the
policies
of
erisa
and
of
the
bankruptcy
code
are
not
incompatible.
erisa
is
entirely
compatible
with
the
fresh-start
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
indeed,
if
a
debtor
such
as
mr.
shumate,
is...
who
is
entirely
dependent
upon
his
retirement
benefit
for
his
livelihood
is
to
have
any
type
of
fresh
start,
his
retirement
income
must
be
protected.
a
fresh
start
means
protecting
that
retirement
income.
the
anti-alienation
provision
is
not
dependent
upon
state
spendthrift
trust
law.
when
this
court
decided
guidry,
the
court
did
not
refer
to
the
state
spendthrift
trust
law
of
colorado
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
pension
benefits
in
that
case
could
be
subject...
subjected
to
a
constructive
trust.
that
would
be
contrary
to
erisa's
policy
of
national
uniformity.
the
enforcement
would
become
dependent
on
the
vagaries
of
state
spendthrift
trust
laws.
state
spendthrift
trust
law
varies
from
state
to
state.
in
some
states
creditors
can
reach
the
corpus
of
spendthrift
trusts,
and
in
other
states
spendthrift
trusts
have
been
abolished
altogether.
furthermore,
contrary
to
what
petitioner
suggests,
most--
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
--in
some
states,
spendthrift
trust
law
has
been
abolished
altogether.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
they
most
certainly
would
be
an
applicable
law.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
mr.
justice,
i
am
suggesting
that
erisa
has
its
own...
by
virtue
of
the
anti-alienation
provision,
which
has
been...
preempts
state
law,
it
is
the
end
of
the
analysis
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
can
be...
the
pension
benefit
can
be
subjected
to
creditor
process.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
just
not
for
erisa
plans.
and
the
reason
it
is
not
just
for
erisa
plans
and
why
it
is
important,
is
because
many
of
the
practices
that
erisa
actively
encourages
would
be
prohibited
or
violate
the
spendthrift
trust
laws
in
certains
jurisdictions.
for
example,
allowing
employees
to
make
matching
contributions
would
violate
the
spendthrift
trust
laws
in
various
states.
allowing
for
hardship
withdrawals
would
violate
the
spendthrift
trust
laws
in
various
states.
furthermore,
many
spendthrift
trust
laws
would
treat
as
self-settled
a
plan
where
an
employee
can
reach
his
retirement
benefit
upon
termination,
a
provision
that
erisa
requires.
for
these
reasons,
congress
choose
to
preempt
the
area
and
to
avoid
these
nuances
of
state
spendthrift
trust
law.
furthermore,
on
the
element
of
control,
no
fact-based
inquiry
under
state
law
is
necessary
and
no
exception
is
necessary.
erisa
already
contains
adequate
safeguards
to
protect
against
the
type
of
potential
mischief
that
could
occur
as
suggested
by
the
petitioner.
erisa
places
limits
on
the
amounts
that
an
individual
can
contribute
to
a
plan.
it
places
limits
on
the
ability
to
develop
short-term
plans.
it
also
has
requirements
on
the
type
and
number
of
employees
that
would
be
covered
under
a
plan.
erisa
has
stringent
fiduciary
requirements
and
the
secretary
of
labor
is
given
broad
enforcement
powers,
as
is
the
internal
revenue
service,
which
can
disqualify
a
plan
for
violation
and
trigger
significant
adverse
tax
consequences.
furthermore,
section
548
of
the
bankruptcy
code
would
give
a
trustee
the
right
to
avoid
fraudulent
conveyances
made
by
a
person
in
control
during
the
year
preceding
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
these
safeguards
are
adequate,
and
the
type
of
exception
that
is
being
advocated
by
petitioner
is
not
necessary,
and
in
fact,
it
would
destroy
the
uniformity
that
congress
ought
to
achieve.
it
would
also
destroy
many
of
the
provisions
encouraged
by
erisa
to
foster
growth
of
pension
plans.
the
third
reason
why
mr.
shumate's
interest
in
the
retirement
plan
should
be
included...
should
not
be
included
in
the
bankruptcy
estate
is
because
of
the
disparate
treatment
that
the
property
interest
would
be
given
inside
a
bankruptcy
as
opposed
to
outside
a
bankruptcy.
if
a
bankruptcy
exception
to
the
erisa's
anti-alienation
provision
were
to
be
created,
then
a
debtor
outside
of
bankruptcy
would
enjoy
greater
rights
than
a
debtor
who
is
inside
a
bankruptcy.
this
court
has
previously
recognized
that
there
should
be
uniformity
of
treatment
of
property
interests
in
those
circumstances--
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
--it
is...
the
restriction
on
the
voluntary
or
involuntary
alienation
of
erisa
plans
is
uniformly
enforced
outside
of
bankruptcy.
petition
acknowledges
that,
so
that
under
virginia
law,
for
instance,
no
creditor
can
reach
through
garnishment,
attachment
or
any
other
vehicle
that
benefit.
but
a
creditor
could
force
an
individual
into
bankruptcy
either
by
an
involuntary
filing
or
other
pressure...
collection
pressure...
and
thereby
reach
the
retirement
benefit,
so
that
the
retirement
benefit
would
have
a
different
status
inside
a
bankruptcy
where
it
would
be
vulnerable
to
creditors,
as
opposed
to
outside
a
bankruptcy
where
it
would
be
protected.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
the
easy
answer,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
yes.
but
in
the
area
of
erisa,
what
we
are
finding
is
that
erisa
preemption
provisions
are
being
held
to
preempt
state
law
exemptions.
and
so
what
you
are
ending
up
with
in
many
jurisdictions
such
as
in
the
ninth
circuit
are
complete
inability
for
debtors
to
exempt
retirement
benefits,
either
by
exclusion
or
exemption.
mr.
justice
white,
in
response
to
your
question,
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
to
allow
a
trustee
to
assemble
assets
and
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
debtor
and
to
assemble
the
assets
and
liquidate
them
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
i
would
respectfully
say
no,
that
inside
of
bankruptcy,
the
property
interests
are
the
same
as
those
outside
of
bankruptcy.
a
trustee
has
a
few
additional
powers
that
support
or
promote
the
concept
of
equality
of
distribution
among
creditors,
such
as
being
able
to
avoid
preferences
and
pursuing
fraudulent
conveyances.
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
that's
exactly
right,
justice--
mr.
kevin
r.
huennekens
--the
property
is
subject
to
an
automatic
stay,
so
the
creditors
cannot
reach
the
property,
but
the
property
is
there
to
be
liquidated
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors
by
a
trustee
and
then
equally
divided
among
all
creditors
under
the
distribution
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
rather
than
allowing
one
creditor
to
attach
and
beat
out
the
other
creditors.
and
that
would
be
the
policy
difference
that
would
occur
in
bankruptcy.
but
with
regard
to
what
property
can
be
reached,
the
laws
are
uniform
inside
of
bankruptcy
and
out,
otherwise,
creditors
would
be
encouraged
to
file
involuntary
bankruptcies
and
force
creditors
into
bankruptcy,
which
is
a
policy
which
has
not
been
encouraged
under
the
law.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
for
just
one
moment,
the
suggestion
about
the
pay
status
in
this
case.
in
petitioner's
brief
and
response,
it
suggests
that
this
case
was
already
in
a
pay
status
and
suggests
a
date
that
was
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
by
mr.
shumate.
mr.
shumate
filed
bankruptcy
a
month
before
the
date
that
petitioner
contends
the
plan
was
terminated.
in
fact,
this
plan,
the
trust,
held
these
assets
for
3
years
after
the
date
that
petitioner
suggests
was
the
termination
date,
which
i
would
suggest
is
an
artificial
date.
and
in
any
event,
a
bankruptcy
estate
is
created
under
section
541
upon
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
and
not
upon
any
date
of
conversion,
and
section
348
bears
that
out
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
thank
you.
