where
is
the
language
you
are
talking
about?
the
text
of
the
reasonable
needs--
--6(b)(a),
isn't
it?
no.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
refer
to
erisa
though.
that's
why
you
mislead
me.
i
am
looking
around.
it
doesn't
say
erisa.
justice
scalia
exclusively
erisa,
nothing
but
erisa--
justice
scalia
--yes,
but
that
shoots
your
argument.
justice
scalia
that
utterly
destroys
your
argument.
justice
scalia
but
even
if
erisa
is
excluded
under
the
earlier
provision,
you
would
still
need
this
provision
to
cover
some
plans
other
than
erisa,
as
to
which
you
wanted
only
the
reasonable
needs
limitation;
isn't
that
right?
so
it
would
still
make
sense.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
maybe
not,
but
you
can't
say
that
it
is
utterly
illogical.
you
might
say
that
it
doesn't
cover
very
much,
but
it
still
covers
something
that
you
would
need
that
language
to
cover,
despite
the
fact
that
you
had
excluded
erisa
earlier.
justice
scalia
a
little
bit.
justice
scalia
you
mean
it
doesn't
cover
spendthrift
trusts?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
in
those
states
where
there
is
spendthrift
trust
laws,
they
would
apply.
they
would
be
an
applicable
law,
wouldn't
they?
justice
scalia
so
that
problem
of
having
somewhat
varying
and
inconsistent
state
laws
apply,
i
mean,
that
problem
exists
no
matter
what,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
once
you
have
an
erisa
plan,
i
understand.
but
you
are
not
suggesting
that
courts
would
not
have
to
grapple
with
varying
state
laws
with
respect
to
spendthrift
trusts
under
this
provision
anyway.
i
mean,
in
some
other
instances,
they
will
have
to
do
that.
justice
scalia
but
just
not
for
erisa
plans.
