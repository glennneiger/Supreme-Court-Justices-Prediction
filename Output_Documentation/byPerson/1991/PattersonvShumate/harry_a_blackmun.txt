justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondent,
shumate,
was
a
participant
in
his
employer's
pension
plan.
it
contained
the
antialienation
provision
that
is
required
for
a
plan's
qualification
under
the
1974
statute
we
call
erisa.
the
district
court
rejected
his
contention
that
his
interest
in
the
plan
should
be
excluded
from
his
bankruptcy
estate
under
a
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
that
provision
excludes
property
that
is
subject
to
a
restriction
on
transfer
enforceable
under
"applicable
non-bankruptcy
law".
the
trial
court
held
that
the
latter
phrase
embraced
only
state
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
ruled
that
the
interest
should
be
excluded
from
the
bankruptcy
estate.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment
by
a
unanimous
vote.
the
plain
language
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
erisa
establishes
that
an
antialienation
provision
in
a
qualified
pension
plan
constitutes
a
restriction
on
transfer
enforceable
under
applicable
non-bankruptcy
law.
justice
scalia,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
statement.
