mr.
a.
camden
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
because
mr.
lucas'
land
has
been
taken
without
just
compensation
being
paid.
the
guiding
principle
in
a
case
like
this
seems
to
rest
on
a
determination
when
justice
and
fairness
require
that
the
economic
injuries
caused
by
public
action
should
be
borne
by
the
many
rather
than
the
few,
or,
as
justice
holmes
said,
when
has
a
regulation
gone
too
far?
our
position
is
simple.
when
mr.
lucas
was
denied
all
economically
viable
uses
of
his
land,
these
basic
principles
demand
that
mr.
lucas
be
paid
just
compensation
for
that
taking.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
don't
own
it,
but
with
the
taxes
that
are
owed
on
it
i
would
be
willing
to
give
it
to
you,
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir,
we
did
not
concede
that.
we
conceded
that
the
regulation
was
a
regulation
that
substantially
advanced
legitimate
state
interests.
that's
all
we
did.
we
did
not
challenge
the
regulation
on
the
first
prong
of
the
tiburon
or
agins
test,
we
just
said
that
we
were
not
going
to
challenge
that,
that
we
were
going
to
say,
and
as
we
did
prove,
that
all
economically
viable
uses
of
the
land
were
gone.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
think
it
is
always
applicable,
and
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
my
question
would
then
become
is
when
you
look
at
the
uses
that
were
available
before
and
after,
if
the
only
use
was
something
was
so
obnoxious
and
so
bad
as
to
be
able
to
meet
whatever
definition
you
want
to
as
a
lucas
it
wouldn't
be
worth
very
much
money,
so
therefore
when
you
apply
the
before
and
after
value,
or
the
before
and
after
use,
i
think
that
takes
care
of
that
extreme
case
that
i
can't
imagine
that
you've
just
mentioned.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
nuisance
is
different
to
everybody,
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
you
have
said
in
the
tiburon
case...
and
i
think
it's
very
different.
in
the
tiburon
case
your...
denies
an
owner
economically
viable
use
of
the
land.
you
use
the
word
land
in
that
case.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
well,
i
think
first
of
all--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
that
is...
the
building
and
the
land
go
together
as
a
unit.
that's
the
case
in
mugler,
and
that
case
i
think
you
looked...
in
that
case
they
haven't
denied
all
economic
uses
of
it,
and
to
go
back
to
your
question
on
real
versus
personal
property,
there
is
a
great
distinction.
real
property
throughout
our
jurisprudence
has
been
found
to
be
unique.
you
can
have
a
specific
performance
for
real
property.
there's
also
a
big
difference
when
you're
dealing
with
real
property
and
personal
property
between
what's
entitlement
and
what's
a
fundamental
right.
it's
a
fundamental
right
to
own
property,
to
live
on
property.
how
you
go
out
and
what
you
can
sell
and
how
you
can
do
that,
that's
an
entitlement--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir,
it's
a
fundamental
right
to
own
it.
it's
not
a
fundamental
right
to
go
out
and
sell
it
if
something's
wrong
with
it
or
if
it's
diseased
or
something
like
that.
that's
not
a
fundamental
right,
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
the
fact
of
the
fifth
amendment,
when
they
say
that
you
can't
take
property
without
paying
just
compensation,
that's
a
right
to
own
and
use
property.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
saying
that
the
right
to
use
your
property
is
the
fundamental
right.
ownership,
not
everybody
owns
property.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
say
it's
a
fundamental
right
because
if
you
have
property
and
you
go
back
and
see
that
the
uses
of
property
are
what
makes
up
property.
if
you
have
property,
you
have
the
right
to
use
it.
you
have
said
that
in
tiburon,
that
when
you
take
all
the
uses,
it's
gone.
you
have
said
in
the
cases
that
you
look
at
the
uses
that
are
remaining
afterwards,
so
property
is
just
made
up
of
uses.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
i
agree,
and
that
is
what
i
meant
to
say,
and
if
i
didn't,
i
apologize.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
that
was
two
years
between
the
first
enactment--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--and
then
this
amendment
in
1990,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
not
in
this
case,
no.
what
happened
in
this
case,
you
have
two
courts
finding
that
all
the
viable
uses
are
gone.
you
have
the
lower
court
finding
that
it
is
a
permanent
taking.
you
have
a
stipulation
of
the--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--what
we
have
is,
it's
interesting
in
the
stipulations
in
the
court
below.
you
have
a
stipulation
in
the
court
below,
number
11,
which
says
that
the
current
law
will
not
allow
any
structures
to
be
on
this
piece
of
property,
and
then
we
have
a
stipulation
number
16
which
says
that
any
permit
would
be
denied.
at
that
same
period
of
time,
this
act
that
later
came
law
was
in
the
process
and
in
the
legislature,
so
those
two
things
right
there
show
that
there
was
at
least
a
contemplation
when
they
said
the
current
law
says--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--it
had
not
been
enacted,
but
it
was
in
the
process...
senate
act
number
391.
it
was
in
the
process
of
being
debated.
it
was
a
hotly
debated
subject
all
over
south
carolina
because
of
the
impact
of
this
act
on
the
beach
property
owners.
the
supreme
court
was
asked
to
include
the
1990
amendment
in
this
and
they
refused
and
found
that
the
case
went
forward
to
be
right.
if
you
look
at
that
particular
amendment--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir,
it
is
just
a
consideration.
i
think
that
they
looked
at
it--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
with
the
finding
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
this...
the
building
of
a
house
or
a
home
on
this
property
is
detrimental
to
the
health,
safety,
or
welfare,
that
they
are
required
under
the
amendment
to
turn
my
application
down.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
they
would
have
a
change
of
heart.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
think
that
under
the...
if
you
look
at
the
findings
of
the
supreme
court
and
you
look
at
the
law
and
you
compare
the
two,
which
is
section
48.39
290(d)--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir.
i
think
the
dissenting
judges
said
that...
if
i
remember
correctly,
they
said
that
either
pay
them
the
money
or
give
them
a
permit.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
or
to
pay
the
money.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
cannot
say
that
one
of
the
options
in
this
case,
because
there
has
been--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--they
also
said
that
it
wasn't
detrimental
to
the
health,
welfare
and
safety,
so
once
they
take...
there
you
have
to
look
at
their
opinion,
dissenting
opinion
as
a
whole.
they
say
it
wasn't
detrimental
to
the
health,
safety,
and
welfare,
so
you
take
that
particular
stamp
on
mr.
lucas'
property
away,
and
he
sure
could
apply,
but
the
dissent
didn't
carry
the
day
on
that
particular
finding
of
fact.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
absolutely.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
absolutely.
there
are
2
years
where
there's
absolutely
nothing
mr.
lucas
could
do
with
this
property
whatsoever.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
what
i'm
saying
by
that,
that
this
property
is
worth
0,
$0.
that
before
and
after
the
uses,
the
before
and
after
value,
before
it
was
worth
a
$1
million
and
it
was
a
nice
home
site,
two
nice
home
sites.
afterwards
it
has
no
uses
and
no
value.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
well,
valuation
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
keys
in
it.
it
also
goes
to
uses.
the
uses
determine
the
value
in
all
pieces
of
property.
so
i
think
when
you
go
down
and
you
take
a
piece
of
property
from
uses
down
to
no
uses
and
from
$1
million
down
to
$0,
you
have
a
taking
under
our
constitution
regardless
of
what--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
this
is
on
the
isle
of
palms,
and,
well
it
is--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--most
of
the
homes,
believe
it
or
not,
on
that
island
made
it.
what
really
caught
most
of
it
was
when
it
came
across
charleston
and
it
came
on
inland
and
all
the
way
to
charlotte.
but
those
homes
that
were
on
the
isle
of
palms
at
the
time
of
hugo,
most
of
those
made
it.
there
was
more
damage
to
some
of
the
condominium
high-rise
structures
than
it
were
to
the
low
homes,
with
reference
hugo.
but
it
is
just
north
of
charleston
and
it
did
get
plenty
of
hurricane
hugo,
i
can
assure
you
of
that.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
it
is
not
taking
for
the
following
reason.
it
was
not
the
regulation
that
took
the
value
of
the
land,
it
was
the
discovery
of
the
fact
that
the
land
had
no
value
in
the
first
place.
so
when
you
take
the
before
and
after
test,
the
uses
before
and
after,
you
find
that
it
is
the
fact
that
it's
on
a
fault
and
it's
no
good
to
build
on
anyway,
if
that's
the
case.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
because
if
look...
if
you
go
out
there
and
if
you
look
at
the
land,
and
you
go
out
there
and
see
it,
you
have
a
big
house
on
the
left,
you
have
a
big
house,
a
four
story
house
in
the
middle,
and
on
the
other
side
you
have
a
big
house,
and
you
have
houses
all
around
it.
i
mean
the
facts
of
this
case
don't
support
such
a
conclusion,
and
justice
toll--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
we
indeed
say
that.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
well
this
is--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--well,
what
i'm
saying
in
that
case,
if
there's
an
urgent
safety
reason,
the
urgency
of
that,
whatever
it
is,
if
it's
a
fire
coming
down
on
you,
if
it's
a
fact
that
there's
a
bomb
underneath
of
you,
the
exigencies
of
that
situations
are
what
demands
that.
in
this
case
there's
no
such
thing.
justice
toll
took
some
findings
in
the
legislature
that
said
it
was
to
protect
the
beaches
from
erosion
and
for
tourism
and
so
forth,
and
she
made
a
quantum
leap
and
said
that
therefore
we
have
said
that
it
is
a
great
public
harm
to
build
a
house
on
this
property.
and
that
is
not
at
all
the
case.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir.
what
i
am
saying
is,
is
the
findings
that
there
was
a
great
public
harm
was
not
a
finding
that
ever
came
out
until
justice
toll
made
that
quantum
leap
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
that
was
never
a
finding
of
any
other
court.
it
just
came--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--they
never
said
anything
about
it
being
a
great
public
harm.
all
they
said
was
that,
and
if
you
can
look
at
the
factual
findings
of
the
legislature
it
talks
about
a...
the
erosion,
it
talks
about
tourism,
it
talks
about
making
the
beaches
nice
and
making
them
pretty,
it
has
a
whole
bunch
of
nice
statements
that
all
legislation
has
for
the
reason
they
passed
such
an
act.
but
to
take
that
and
to
say,
okay,
i'm
going
to
jump
from
that
and
say
that
these
findings
make
it
a
great
public
harm,
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that.
if
you're
going
to
do
that,
what
happens
is
that
we're
going
to
have
to...
us
lawyers
out
here
in
every
regulatory
taking
case,
we're
going
to
have
to
attack
the
statute.
because
we're
going
to
be
in
fear
that
some
higher
authority
or
judge
is
going
to
say
we
didn't
attack
the
statute
as
it
substantially
advances
legitimate
state
interests,
and
because
you
didn't
do
that,
hey
it's
a
nuisance
and
we
can
take
your
property.
so
you're
going
to
turn
every
regulatory
taking
case
into
an
attack
on
the
statute
as
to
whether
or
not
it
can
be
interpreted
as
a
nuisance
or
not.
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
it
should
be.
and
we
have
not
conceded
anything
by
saying
that
this
is
a
laudable
purpose,
to
try
to
protect
the
beaches.
we've
not
conceded
our
land,
to
put
a
house
on
our
land,
a
home
on
our
land,
is
a
nuisance.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
don't--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
we--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
in
our
petition
we
took
the
position
that
the
mere
labeling
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
it
was
a
great
public
harm
was
not
something
that
could
be
used
as
a
basis
for
denying
just
compensation.
surely,
we
did
that.
that
is
an
integral
part
of
our
whole
case.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
there
is
something
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
remember
how
long
back,
that
there
was
a
pond
on
one
of
our
lots.
if
you
ever
go
out
to
the
ocean
you'll
see,
you'll
sit
on
one
side
and
you
have
to
walk
around
some
water
that's
out
there
to
get
to
the
beach
on
the
other
side.
there
was
that,
that
was
there.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
and
this
whole
island
has
been
accreting
for
some
1,500
years,
and
you'll
find
that
under
the
methodology
used,
that
they
had
to
choose
a
vegetation
line
for
purposes
of
setting
the
setback
lines
on
this
piece
of
property
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
been
accreting
and
that
they
could
not
use
that
other
formula
with
reference
to
the
last,
40
times
the
erosion
rate.
they
could
not
use
that
on
this
property
simply
because
it
was
accreting
and
had
been
accreting
for
some
time.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
think,
well
first
of
all
if
i
used
the
word
finding
i
want
to
withdraw
that.
it's
a
labeling.
there
was
no
finding
whatsoever,
it
was
a
mere
labeling
of
what
the
legislature
had
found,
as
you
say.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
it
is
a
shorthand
for
the
legislature
and
a
labeling
of
the
legislature
and
has
no
basis.
and
then
the
court
doesn't
say
so,
that
it
has
any
basis
in
the
record,
or
the
facts
of
the
record.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
don't
believe
the
stipulation
said
that
the
argument
on
the
temporary
take
is
reserved.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
more
facts
for
a
temporary
taking.
if
they
say,
hey--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
it's...
we
say
the
temporary
taking
would
be
the
same
standard
so
that
all
of
the
facts,
everything
is
in
this
record
with
reference
to
temporary
take.
the
only
difference
is,
is
the
quantum
of
the
damages
that
would
be
available
to
you.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
that's
it.
the
trial
court
found,
in
the
record,
that
he
was
going
to
build
a
house
and
that
he
was
going
to
hold
the
other
piece
of
property
for
investment.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
the
plans
are
in
the
record,
of
the
house
that
he's
going
to
build.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
going
to
build
the
house
that's
in
the
record,
and
there's
a
stipulation
that
they
wouldn't
let
him.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
was
there
specific
evidence--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--as
to
the
starting
date,
no
sir.
because
you
can't
have
a
starting
date
until
you
have
a
permit,
and
they
dismissed
that
and
said
i
couldn't
have
a
permit.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
oh,
i
think
that
is
definitely
within
the
record,
that
he
intended
to
build
right
away.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no
question.
i
was
going
to
hold
one
piece
for
investment.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
oh,
that
is
exactly
right.
but
i
don't...
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
temporary
take
or
not.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
it
only
goes
to
the
quantum
of
the
damages.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
oh,
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is
in
the
record
already,
as
to
at
least
one
house.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
no,
sir,
my
argument
is
that...
and
i
think
you
will
look
at
the
order
of
judge
patterson
and
you
will
find
that
what
we
said
was
that
when
we
are
denied,
under
the
tiburon
test,
we
are
denied
an
owner
economically
viable
use
of
the
land,
we
get
paid
for
a
taking.
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
sir.
that
is
because--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--yes,
sir.
we
gave
up
the
substantially
advanced
legitimate
state
interest.
we
said
that
the
statute
did
that,
and
we
think
that
there
is
no...
they
want
a
per
se
rule.
they
want
to
say
there
is
some
legitimate
state
interest
type
situation
as
to...
and
that
you
can
forget
about
what
you
do
to
the
value
and
the
uses
and
you
can
take
it.
they
are
asking
for
the
per
se
rule--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--i
deny
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
that's
right
because
if
i
take
the
tiburon
test,
i
have
to
read
out
the
word
"or"
to
make
that
test
work
because
that
is
an
"or"
test
in
tiburon
and
it
says,
substantially
advanced
legitimate
state
interest
or
denies
an
owner
economically
viable
uses.
we
do,
in
our
reply
brief,
point
out,
if,
and
we
say
that,
if,
and
that
we
don't
agree
that
if
you
are
going
to
go
to
some
kind
of
exception
that
it
be
something
that
is
an
imminent
danger
of
such
a
magnitude
to
justify
denial
of
just
compensation,
and
only
when
such
action's
purpose
is
to
control
that
imminent
danger.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--no,
sir,
absolutely
not.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
well,
to
save
the
city,
now
then
you
are
going
to
get
into
factual
information
as
to
what
your
before
use
was,
your
after
use
was--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--right.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
if
it
had
value
before--
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
--and
you
took
it
away,
you
pay.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
we
call
it
a
public
necessity
exception,
if
there
is
such
one,
and
that
is
has
to
be
imminent
danger
of
such
a
magnitude
to
justify
denial
of
just
compensation
and
that
the
action's
purpose
is
to
control
the
imminent
danger,
not
in
this
case...
and
that
this
case
would
not
meet
that
test
whatsoever,
and
i
would
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
a.
camden
lewis
i
will
entertain
any
questions
of
the
court.
