justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
always
require,
in
your
view,
the
payment
of
compensation
if
all
economically
viable
use
of
the
land
is
gone,
or
is
that
not
applicable
if
there's
a
nuisance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
even
if
this
were
a
nuisance,
compensation
would
be
required
if
the
restriction
on
the
land
took
away
all
of
its
economic
viability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
land
different
from--
--i
guess
the
reason
we
can't
imagine
it
and
we
haven't
had
a
case
on
it
is
because
the
definition
of
nuisance
would
be
so
expansive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
suppose
there's
a
residential
subdivision
and
a
person
owns
lots
that
are
zoned
for
residential
improvement,
but
they're
vacant
lots.
and
an
earthquake
fault
is
discovered
and
the
expert
opinion
is
that
it
is
very
very
dangerous
to
build
and
the
county
denies
zoning
permit
for
that
reason.
and
assume
also
that
all
economic
viability
of
the
land
is
gone.
is
that
a
taking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why,
why
can't
the
state
say
here
that
the
finding
was
that
this
coastal
zone,
because
of
new
and
detailed
studies
with
reference
to
erosion,
is
now
a
very
dangerous
place
to
build;
dangerous
for
the
owner,
dangerous
for
the
neighbors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then
it's
just
a
factual
matter
we're
arguing
about.
we...
your
client
stipulated
the
fact
that
this
ordinance
had,
or
this
regulation
had
a
valid
public
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
instances
in
which
all
economic
viability
can
be
deprived
because
of
an
urgent
safety
reason,
and
that
there's
no
taking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
think
your
answer
has
refuted
that
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
wasn't
challenged
in
this
case.
all
you...
your
whole
theory
is
that
if
all
economic
viability
is
lost,
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
assume
the
legislature
can
make
a
finding,
can't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
explain
an
alternative
statement
in
the
agins
case
in
which
we
do,
it
seems
to
me,
indicate
that
there
is
a
taking,
if
the
owner
is
denied
all
economically
viable
use
of
his
land.
that's
the
court's
term,
economically
viable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
was
an
investment
expectation
here.
are
you
saying
that
it
was
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
law?
