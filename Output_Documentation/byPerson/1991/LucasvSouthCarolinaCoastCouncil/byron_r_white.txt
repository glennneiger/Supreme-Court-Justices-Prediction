justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
settle
the
rightness
for
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
still
have
a
right
to
apply
for
the
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
asking
us
to
decide
that,
but
we
don't
really
know
if
you
applied
for
an
exemption
whether
you'd
get
it
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
counsel,
i
see
that
your
opponent
at
one
point
says
the
issue
of
temporary
taking
was
preserved
at
trial
by
stipulation,
and
hence
that
it
too
is
not
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that...
let's
assume
that
we
disagree
with
you
that,
that
your
overall
claim
is
not
right
because
of
your
right
to
apply
for
an
exception.
and
that
the
only
issue
that's
left
then,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
is
the
temporary
taking
issue.
that
issue
hasn't
been
dealt
with
by
any
of
the
courts
below,
whether
there
was
a
temporary
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
i
suppose
somebody,
if
you're
arguing
for
a
temporary
taking,
you
would
have
to...
there
would
be
issues
about,
well
when
did
you
really
intend
to
build.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
he
was
going
to
build
a
house.
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
plans
are
in
the
record,
but
you
never
did
apply
for
a
building
permit,
i
guess.
was
there
evidence,
i
expected
to
build
tomorrow,
or
next
year,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
we
still...
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
was
there
evidence,
specific
evidence,
as
to
when
he
was...
wanted
to
build?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
know,
you
could
say
i
intended
to
build
right
away,
i
suppose--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
you
were
going
to
build
two
houses,
one
of
them
for
speculation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
if
you're
building...
if
you're
going
to
build
a
spec
house,
you
don't
always
just
build
right
away,
you
try
to
figure
out
what
the
market
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
there
would
be
proof
that
you
ever
would
have
built
during
these
2
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
the
reason
for
the
statute
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
and
they
probably
didn't
even
spend
a
million
dollars.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think...
i
didn't
understand
the
south
carolina
court
to
go
on
that
basis,
that
he
didn't
have
any
valid
expectation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
comes
here,
i
think
if
the
case
comes
here,
i
thought
the
california
court...
or
your
state
court
said
that
even
if
there
is
a
valid
investment
expectation,
even
if
the
law
deprives
the
landowner
of
all
economic
value,
even
if
this
law
is
valid,
and
no
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
am
i
right
at
least
to
this
extent,
that
if...
that
your
state
court's
opinion
would
bar
also
any
claim
of
a
temporary
taking?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
already
conceded
that
the
opinion
of
your
state
court
bars
any
claim
of
a
temporary
taking,
even
if
the
rest
of
the
case
is
not
right,
in
which
event,
then
the
legal
issue
about
the
correctness
of
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
is
before
us
and
we
have
to...
we
can't
say
the
temporary
takings
claim
isn't
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
just
assumes...
but
let's
just
assume
that
under
the
state
court's
opinion
and
judgment
there
could
be
no
temporary
takings
claim
for
the
same
reason
that
it
decided
there
couldn't
be
any
claim
at
all.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
we
can
just
completely
remand
the
whole
case.
