justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
i
would
remand
to
the
coastal
council
its
decision
as
to
whether
to
issue
the
permits
in
view
of
the
recent
1990
amendments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
certainly
one
of
the
options
was
to
consider
it
under
the
1990
amendment.
that's
what
the
dissenting
judge
says
in
so
many
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
don't
say
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
the
dissenting
judges
on
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
said
that
was
an
option.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lewis,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
that
perhaps
isn't
in
the
record?
is
this
property
located
right
where
that
hurricane
hit
in
charleston?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
on
the
isle
of
palms,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that
whole
island
was
virtually
desolated
by
the
hurricane.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
lewis,
on
that
question,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
thought
you'd
conceded
that,
at
least
they
said
that
in
their
opinion.
did
you
in
your
cert
petition
ask
us
to
review
the
accuracy
of
that
concession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
we
took
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
you
had
made
such
a
concession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
you're
telling
us
you
really
didn't,
and
i'm
not
saying
you
did,
obviously.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
were
we
on
notice
that
that
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
things
we'd
have
to
decide?
