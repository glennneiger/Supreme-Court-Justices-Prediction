william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
91-453,
david
h.
lucas
v.
south
carolina
coastal
council.
mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewis,
is
it
perfectly
clear
from
the
opinion
of
the
majority
in
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
that
they
accepted
the
hypothesis
that
he
was
denied
all
economically
viable
use
of
his
land?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
ownership
of
property
is
a
fundamental
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
property
without
being
paid
compensation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
much
more
careful
statement
of
the
proposition
than
the
statement
that
ownership
of
property
is
a
fundamental
right.
do
you
have
any
further
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
it's
a
fundamental
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
fact
that
property
is
jus
made
up
of
uses
does
not
necessarily
prove
that
the
ownership
of
it
is
a
fundamental
right.
it
seems
to
me
you
can
do
all
you
need
for
your
case
by
simply
adhering
to
the
language
of
the
just
compensation
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
expound
on
whether
property
is
a
fundamental
right.
all
you
have
to
prove
is
that
you
were
deprived
of
the
use
of
property
without
being...
by
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
no
doubt,
is
there,
mr.
lewis,
that
there
was
a
period
from
1988
until
1990
when
there
was
no
permit
for
which
you
could
have
applied
for?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
simply...
the
situation
described
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
did
obtain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lewis.
mr.
harness,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
say
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
harm
others
and
link
it
to
your
argument...
what
about
justice
holmes'
opinion
in
mann
against
pennsylvania
coal
company,
where
there
was
no
question
that
the
sub-surface
mining
would
very
likely
to
cause
the
subsidence
of
some
residences,
and
yet
the
court
said
that
the
compensation
had
to
be
paid.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
don't
you
think
then
your
proposition
that
there
is
no
right
to
harm
others
in
support
of
your
idea
of
the
nuisance
exception
is
perhaps
too
broad,
that
sometimes
there
will
be
some
actions
of
property
owners
that
may
cause
some
sort
of
harm
to
others
and
yet,
perhaps
they
may
not
be
totally
proscribed
without
paying
compensation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harness.
mr.
lewis,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
apparently
the
court
has
no
questions.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-453,
lucas
against
south
carolina
coastal
council
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
