mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
south
carolina
asks
you
to
uphold
the
decision
of
our
supreme
court
for
what
we
believe
to
be
two
very
compelling
reasons.
first
is
that
the
restrictions
of
the
south
carolina
beach
front
management
act
are
based
upon
a
very
real
and
considered
truth,
and
that
is
building
upon
unstable
land,
unstable
beaches,
the
fragile
beach
dune
system
creates
great
public
risk
of
harm.
secondly,
the
petitioner
never
challenged
that
legislative
determination,
but
instead
claimed
it
was
irrelevant
to
his
takings
claim.
his
theory
of
the
case
is
based
upon
the
extreme
proposition
that
economic
impact
alone,
without
any
other
consideration,
is
a
determinant
of
taking.
the
theory
is
wrong.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
harm
others.
secondly,
the
threat
is
well
documented.
building
on
an
unstable
and
fragile
beach
dune
system
does
create
harm.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
i
think
what
justice
holmes
was
looking
at
was
the
balance
between
the
degree
of
harm.
there
was
very
little
public
harm,
in
his
way
of
thinking.
it
was
a
private
harm
that
he
was
discussing.
and
in
that
instance,
in
that
particular
instance,
the
degree
of
diminution
in
value
was
very
significant.
i
think
in
looking
at
the
harm,
what
the
court
does
is
to
look
at
the
degree
of
the
harm.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
i
would
concede
that.
i
think
that
this
goes
back
to
what
has
been
termed
the
mugler
principle.
the
community
has
authority
to
prevent
serious
public
harm
by
denying
uses
without
being
required
to
pay
compensation,
but
certainly
it
is
a
measure
of
the
degree
of
harm
that
the
state
is
seeking
to
prevent.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
i
think
what
the...
no--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--i
think
if
i
might
answer,
they
did
two
things.
one
is
they
first
said
that
the
petitioner
never
raised
the
issue,
that
all
he
raised
was
the
unique
argument
that
diminution
in
value
alone
equaled
to
a
taking.
but
secondly,
i
think
that
the
legislative
findings
and
facts
that
are
laid
out
in
the
act
gave
the
court
reason,
and
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
there
were
great
public
harms.
if
you
read
the
findings
and
purposes
of
the
act,
clearly
they're
directed
at
the
highest
type
of
police
power
activity,
that
is
preventing
threat
to
life
and
property.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
no,
sir,
it
does
not
say
that,
but
i
think
that
that
has
been
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
this
court,
that
if
there
is
a
great
threat
to
life
and
property,
that
certainly
would
fit
within
the
commonly
called
nuisance
exception.
and
in
essence
the
nuisance
exception,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
shorthand
way
of
saying,
the
state
has
the
permission
or
the
authority
to
prevent
great
public
harm
without
paying
compensation
depend
upon
that
degree.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
i
think
that
the
threat
is
very
real.
first
of
all,
the
act
looked
at
the
threat
to
life
and
property
by
building
near
the
ocean.
it
is
well
recognized
that
portions
of
homes,
even
homes
themselves
during
times
of
great
storm
events
will
be
blown
or
washed
into
houses
behind
them--
secondly,
that
septic
tanks
and
that
sewer
lines
that
lead
to
these
houses
are
very
near
the
ocean,
break
asunder
and
that
those
contaminants
are
put
into
public
waters.
thirdly,
that
water
lines
are
broken
and
the
water
supply
is
contaminated,
and
fourthly--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--if
i
follow
your
question,
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
there
is
clear
evidence
that
the
closer
you
build
to
the
ocean
and
if
you
build
upon
the
beach
dune
system,
that
you
run--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--currently,
the
property
is
behind
the
dunes,
but
the
evidence
presented
by
the
south
carolina
coastal
council
said
20
percent
of
the
time
in
the
last
40
years,
the
shoreline
has
been
landward
of
the
road
behind
him,
and
50
percent
of
the
time
this
lot
has
either
been
on
the
active
beach
or
under
water.
it
is
certainly
an
unstable
type
of
beach
that
typically
the
act
was
seeking
to
address.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
people,
before
the
passage
of
this
act,
built
up
to
the
highest
up-rush
of
the
waves
on
our
coast
with
no
consideration
at
all
for
what
threat
they
would
create
for
themselves
and
others.
this
act
was
passed
to
prevent
the
experience
that
the
council
had
been
through
and
that
a
blue
ribbon
committee
looked
at
for
6
months.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
completely.
it
was
under,
it
was
in
the
ocean
in
1963.
it
was
in
the
ocean
20
percent
of
the
time
since
1949.
that
is
what
exhibit
no.
22,
which
is
in
your
appendix,
shows.
it
shows
you
the
shoreline
fluctuations
which
have
been
great
and
significant.
erosion
is
a
problem
along
this
beach.
while
it
is
generally
accreting
there
are
severe
episodes
of
erosion.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
my
theory
would
not
take
me
that
far
for
two
reasons,
i
think.
first
of
all...
or
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
is
typical
of
states
to
pass
laws
once
they
recognize
there
is
a
harm,
to
prevent
new
construction
or
new
harm.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
again--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
for
two
reasons.
i
think
that
what
you
would
have
to
look
at,
under
those
circumstances,
would
be
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
property
owners,
and
secondly--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--these
people
had
already
built--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--these
people
had
already
built--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--about
a
million
dollars.
these
people
had
already
built
under
an
older
law.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
probably
not,
yeah.
and
the
law
changed--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--if
we
allow
economics
to
be
the
sole
determinant
of
takings,
then
you
will
in
essence
eliminate
the
nuisance
exception.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
excuse
me.
the
second
one
is
the
physical
character
of
the
land.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we're
trying
to
do
here
is
to
prevent
an
ongoing
and
continuing
damage
to
the
environment.
the
houses
that
have
already
been
built
there
will
be
removed
over
time,
and
i
think
it
is
a
wise
decision
on
the
part
of
the
state
because
it
would
disrupt
entirely
the
existing
uses
of
property,
and
i
think
it
is...
it
could
be...
it
is
more
fair
to
prevent
new
construction
and
then
to
remove
these
houses
as
they
are
destroyed
and
let--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question,
first
of
all...
let
me
get
some
clarification.
if
you
could
ask
the
question
again.
i
am
not
certain
that
i
have
followed
you
completely.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
at
least
as
it
relates
to
public
health
and
safety,
if
there
is
a
great
threat
to
public
health
and
safety,
as
there
is
at
least
from
the
legislators'
point
of
view
in
this
case,
i
think
that
there
is
insulation
given
to
the
activity
of
the
state.
this
court
has
said
it
depends
upon
the
facts
of
each
case.
i
am
not
certain
that
i
can
stand
here
and
tell
you
today
where
the
limit
can
be
drawn,
but
i
think
certainly
in
this
instance--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--i
think
even
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
even
in
circumstances
where
there
is
construction
upon
unstable
or
very
dangerous
land,
that
even
there,
it
is
for
protection
of
that
house,
and
those
people
that
the
state
could
pass
a
law
to
prevent
that
such
construction,
even
though
it
may
not
have
the--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
no
compensation.
it
would
be
very
similar
to
the
tenement
houses
where
the
court
has
said
you
have
to
either
remove
these
things
or
improve
them.
it
makes
it
impossible
for
the
landowner
to
do
so,
because
of
the
threat
to
the
public.
and
let's
say,
for
example,
in
your
instance,
the
people
rented
the
house
out,
didn't
live
in
it
themselves.
certainly
under
those
circumstances,
the
people
that
are
in
there
are
threatened
by
the
sheer
construction,
or
the
mere
construction
upon
an
unsafe,
unstable
place.
so
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
the
court
has
never,
to
my
knowledge,
applied
that
test.
it
has
repeatedly
said
that
diminution
in
value
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
equate
to
a
taking,
but
i
think
it...
from
the
way
i
have
read
it...
it
may
be
a
shorthand
for
the
fact
that
you
have
to
look
at
two
things,
the
diminution
in
value
and
also
the
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations.
i
don't
think
it
has
been
applied
literally
and
i
have
had
the
same
problem
of
determining
what
the
word
viable
means.
i
assume
that
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
character
of
the
land
as
well
to
be
certain
it
is
of
the
type
that
would
warrant
construction.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
well,
yes,
but
the
court
below
has
never
asked
to
reach
that
point
because
it
was
never
an
issue
before
them.
they
never
had
to
get
to
it.
but
secondly,
this,
mr.
lucas,
the
petitioner
here,
was
owner,
participated
in
wild
use
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
construction,
knew
of
the
erosion
events
that
occurred,
significant
erosion
events
all
the
way
through
the
1980's,
could
or
should
have
known
the
history
of
the
property.
he
was
on
notice
about
the
character
of
the
land.
secondly,
this
beach
front
along
south
carolina
has
been
highly
regulated
for
some
years.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
the
supreme
court
did
not
discuss
that
because
it
did
not
have
to
reach
it.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
it.
the
way
i
understood
the
case
was
that,
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
raised
a
very
extreme
position,
that
diminution
alone
was
sufficient
to
equate
to
a
taking,
and
second,
that
he
conceded
the
purposes
and
findings,
and
as
a
result
the
court
did
not
have
to
go
in
and
look
at
specifically
the
harms
above
what
the
legislature
had
dictated,
because
it
was
never
questioned.
it
was
never
raised.
and
they
were
addressing
the
very
narrow
theory
that
he
presented
to
the
court,
which
is
diminution
alone
was
sufficient
to
equate
to
a
taking.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
that's
correct.
as
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
opinion
analogizes
to
wetlands
regulation,
and
they
say
just
as
with
respect
to
the
'77
coastal
zone
management
act,
which
prevented
the
uncontrolled
use
of
coastal
wetlands,
and
it
says
our
analysis
there
did
not
contain
a
discussion
of
whether
any
economically
viable
use
remained
in
the
property,
so
also
we
don't
have
to
have
that
discussion
here,
and
i
don't
think
wetlands
regulation
is
something
that
i
would
call
calling
into
question
high
concerns
of
public
safety.
in
carter...
the
case
they're
referring
to
is
carter
v.
south
carolina
coastal
council.
the
same
type
of
questions
that
were
raised
here,
that
is
diminution
alone
is
sufficient
for
taking,
was
also
raised
in
that
case.
they
did
not
have
to
look
at
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations,
but
it
was...
they
did
rely
upon
an
old
case,
just
v.
marinette
county,
that
talks
about
justified
expectations
in
that
there
is
no
justified
expectation
on
the
part
of
any
person
to
use
property
in
a
way
that
harms
others
and
requires
that
you
change
the
natural
character
of
the
area
so
as
to
make
it
economically...
or,
to
make
an
economic
use
of
it,
so
i
think
the
court
implicitly
talked
about
it
in
carter,
the
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations,
although
it
was
not
raised.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
that
is--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--no,
sir.
that
has
not
been
our
position,
it
was
not
that
position
presented
to
the
court,
and
i
think
their
position
is
better
characterized
as
not
having
to
reach
that
issue
because
of
the
narrow
way
in
which
the
case
was
postured
to
them.
they
weren't
required...
they
weren't...
at
no
point
in
time
were
they
asked
to
look
at
the
harm.
the
state
was
not
required
to
defend
on
that
position.
as
a
consequence,
he
made
his
bed
and
the
court
said
you
sleep
in
it.
you
didn't
challenge
it
and
we
don't
have
to
get
to
it
because
you
didn't
ask
us
about
it.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
carter
rested
upon
the
proposition...
and
the
court
talked
about
the
difference
between
eminent
domain
and
taking
in
that
case...
rested
on
the
proposition
that
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
use
your
property
in
a
way
that
harms
others,
so
they
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
public
harm.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
no,
my
position
is
not
that.
our
position
is--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--in
carter,
there
was
no
question
raised
about
the
degree
of
harm.
it
simply
said
public
harm.
our
position
has
been
throughout
the
course
of
this
trial
and
before
this
court
that
there
is
a
degree
of
public
harm
that
warrants
insulation.
i
don't
know
exactly
where
that
line
is
and
certainly
the
court
has
had
to
do
it
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
as
it
relates
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
however,
all
they
were
faced
with
was
not
the
degree
of
harm,
it
was
the
fact
that
they
conceded
that
there
was
harm,
and
secondly
they
did
not
raise
it
in
their
very
extreme
position.
one
of
the
other
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
again
back
to
the
degree
of
harm
and
to
talk
a
bit
about
the
purpose
of
the
act.
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
prevent
people
from
building
on
unstable
or
eroding
beaches,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
set-back
scheme.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
i
think
that
you
can.
i
don't
think
that
the
1990
amendments
detract
from
the
fact
that
there
is
serious
public
harm
created
by
building
near
the
ocean.
i
think
what
the
legislature
did
was
to
bring
it
down
to
the
council
level
to
see
if
in
some
rare
and
unusual
circumstances
the
purposes
and
the
ends
or
the
means
could
be
considered
and--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--that
it
is
possible
that--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--it
may
be
possible
from
a
cumulative
sense.
i
don't
think
that
the
legislature
instructed
the
coastal
council
to
go
down
and
look
at
each
individual
lot
but
to
consider
the--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--it
would
be
issued
by
a
14-member
commission.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
i
don't
think
you
can
at
all
assume
what
a
14-member
council
will
do.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
no,
sir,
but
could
i
tell
you
why
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
what
they
did?
shortly
after
arguing
the
case,
or
after
arguing
the
case
the
legislation
was
passed
allowing
for
what
amounts
to
a
variance.
the
counsel
for
the
south
carolina
coastal
council
applied
to
the
court
seeking
to
see
if
the
1990
amendments
would
have
any
effect
on
their
decision,
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said
it
is
too
late
to
make
that
request.
we
don't
have
any
way
under
our
current
rules
to
allow
you
to
argue
after
oral
arguments
have
been
made.
so
as
the
dissent
said,
they
would
have
preferred
to
send
it
back
down
to
the
coastal
council
to
see
what
they
had
gotten.
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
let
me
say
that...
let
me
try
to
answer
that
question,
and
i'm
not
attempting
to
avoid
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
are
asking
for
first
of
all
is
that
you
uphold
the
south
carolina
coastal
council
decision
because
of
the
narrowness
of
its
argument,
but
if
you're
going
to
remand
it,
if
you
consider
remand
i
think
the
remand
should
go
to
whether
or
not
they
can
rely
upon
the
petition's
concessions,
and
whether
they
incorrectly
rely
upon
the
findings--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
say
that
the
temporary
takings
claim
is
not
right
because
no
evidence
was
presented
below
at
all
about--
mr.
c.
c.
harness,
iii
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appropriate
remedy...
and
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general.
i
think
the
appropriate
remedy
is
if
you
cannot
uphold
the
south
carolina
court
that
you
would
remand
to
get
to
the
other
parts
of
the
test,
since
the
only
thing
presented
to
the
court
below
was
the
issue
of
whether
the
loss
of
economic
value
alone
was
sufficient
to
equate
to
a
taking.
thank
you.
