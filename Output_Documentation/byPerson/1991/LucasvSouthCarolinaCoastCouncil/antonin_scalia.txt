justice
antonin
scalia
is
land
different
from
other
property
in
that
regard?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
happened
to
be
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it
had
been
a
cow,
we
would
have
said
a
cow,
i
assume.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
remarkable.
that
doesn't
show
that
land
is
distinctive.
suppose
a
state
decides
that
it
wants
to
prohibit
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages
and
it
enacts
a
statute
to
that
effect
and
somebody
has
a
factory
that
is
useless
for
anything
else
except
for
manufacturing
beer?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
totally
useless.
would
there
be
recovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that's
a
building
and
not
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
fundamental
right
to
own
personal
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
looked
at
the
dissenting
opinion?
didn't
they
think
you
had
a
right
to
apply,
the
dissenting
judges
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lewis,
the
respondent's
brief
contends
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
understood
you
to
be
advancing
a
very
narrow
argument,
to
whit,
that
any
use
of
the
police
power
that
takes
away
the
total
economic
value
of
your
land
is
a
taking,
no
matter
what
nuisance
or
no
nuisance,
no
matter
what,
the
basis
of
the
use
of
the
police
power.
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
your
argument
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
yes,
that
is
a
fair
characterization?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
the
per
se
rule,
and
you
argued
it
below.
if
it
takes
away
all
the
economic
value,
it
is
a
taking
that
has
to
be
compensated.
they
are
saying
that
is
so
sometimes
but
not
all
the
time,
that
if
there
is
a
nuisance,
if
it
is
threatening
the
public
safety,
you
can
take
it
all
away
without
paying
and
you
deny
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
denied
it
below
and
you
continue
to
deny
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
a
fall-back
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
you
should
do
it
at
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
always
have
to
pay
even
if
it
is
to
save
the
city,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
have
to
just
pay,
just
pay.
you
don't
have
to
inquire
in
any
fashion.
your
position
is,
if
it
takes...
at
least
with
real
estate,
if
it
takes
away
the
total
value--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
pay,
no
matter
what
the
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
two
extreme
positions
here.
mr.
lewis
takes
the
position,
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
harm,
you
have
to
pay.
and
as
i
read
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
it
seems
to
say,
it
doesn't
matter
how
little
harm,
you
don't
have
to
pay.
isn't
that
a
fair
description
of
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
find
that
this
was
an
enormous
amount
of
harm,
that
it
was
something
that
rose
to
the
level
of
a
threat
to
life
and
limb
or
even
a
public
nuisance?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
say
highest
type
of
police
power
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
great
threat
to
life
or
property?
that
over
the
next
50
years,
some
adjacent
land
might
erode,
is
that
the
kind
of
immediate
threat
that
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
is
enough
to
prevent
all
building
entirely,
not
necessary
precautions,
just
say
you
can't
build?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
behind
the
dunes,
isn't
it?
this
is
behind
the
dunes,
that
is
what
i
understood,
a
good
distance
behind
the
dunes.
justice
antonin
scalia
apparently
not
unstable
enough
and
not
often
enough
to
stop
people
from
building
houses
all
up
and
down
the
same
street.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
indication
that
this
property
was
ever
in
front
of
the
dunes?
that
the
dunes
were
ever
eliminated
entirely?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
don't
understand.
before
you
go
to
secondly,
didn't
this
person
have
the
same
expectation
when
he
bought
the
land?
he
didn't
buy
it
look
at
the
sand,
he
bought
it
to
build
a
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
had
already
bought
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
spent
several
million
dollars,
didn't
he?
over
a
million.
what
was
the
total
price?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
they
built,
there
was
nobody
else
who
had
houses.
i
would
think
his
case
is
even
better.
he
laid
out
a
million
dollars,
looking
at
these
houses
all
up
and
down
the
street,
and
you
don't
think
he
had
any
expectation
that
he
could
build
a
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
am
sorry,
i
interrupted
you
on
reason
one.
what's
number
two?
reason
one
was
economic
expectations.
we
need
an
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations.
i'm
saying
that
the
court
here
said
we
will
be
overruling
carter
if
we
acknowledged
that
a
total
taking
would
require
compensation.
that's
what
they
said,
and
i
take
that
to
mean...
i
take
that
to
be
the
position
that
any
valid
regulation
of
the
land...
any
valid
regulation,
regardless
of
whether
it
rises
to
the
level
of
regulation
in
order
to
prevent
a
public
nuisance,
does
not
require
compensation
even
if
it
requires...
even
if
it
results
in
a
complete
taking,
a
complete
diminution
of
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
fair
characterization
of
the
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
they
didn't
have
to
get
to
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
that
they
didn't
get
to
it.
i
do
not
see
how
the
carter
case
would
have
been
overruled
by
acknowledgement
that
in
at
least...
that
a
total
taking
requires
compensation.
i
did
not
think
that
carter
rested
upon
the
importance
of
the...
of
public
interest
in
the
wetlands.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
position
you're
defending?
any
use
of
your
property
that
harms
others
can
be
prohibited,
even
to
the
extent
of
depriving
your
land
of
all
its
value,
without
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
again
i
don't
understand
why
carter
would
have
been
overruled
by
acknowledging
the
claim
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
harness,
and
you
say
the
claim
is
not
right
because
application
to
that
council
hasn't
been
made.
i
would
agree
with
that
if
the
south
carolina
court
had
taken
that
position,
but
in...
don't
we
go
along
with
at
least
where
in
the
area
of
prudential
standard,
where
the
state
courts
have
allowed
the
suit
to
proceed,
don't
we
take
appeals
from
those
state
courts?
in
tax
cases,
for
example,
the
federal
rule
is
a
taxpayer
has
no
standing,
but
if
a
state
wants
to
give
a
state
taxpayer
standing
we
will
review
that
case
and
we
won't
apply
our
prudential
rule,
will
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever
the
reason,
they
went
ahead,
and
they
did
not
consider
it
unright.
rightness
is
a
prudential
doctrine.
i
don't
know
why
it
is
not
prudent
for
us,
having
a
decision
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
in
effect
to
say
in
this
case
we'll
treat
it
the
same
way.
why
don't
we
just
do
the
same
thing
that
they
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
in
1986,
the
petitioner,
david
lucas,
bought
two
residential
lots
on
the
isle
of
palms,
a
south
carolina
barrier
island,
intending
to
build
single
family
homes
as
the
owners
of
the
immediately
adjacent
parcels
had
already
done.
at
that
time,
lucas'
lots
were
not
subject
to
the
state's
coastal
zone
building
permit
requirements.
in
1988,
however,
the
state
legislature
enacted
the
beachfront
management
act
which
barred
lucas
from
erecting
any
permanent
habitable
structures
on
his
parcels.
he
filed
suit
against
respondent,
south
carolina
coastal
council,
contending
that
even
though
the
act
may
have
been
a
lawful
exercise
of
the
state's
police
power,
the
ban
on
construction
deprived
him
of
all
economically
viable
use
of
his
property
and
therefore
affected
a
taking
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
requiring
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
the
state
trial
court
agreed,
finding
that
the
ban
rendered
lucas'
parcel's
value
list
and
it
entered
an
award
exceeding
$1.2
million.
in
reversing,
the
state
supreme
court
held
its
self
bound
in
light
of
lucas'
failure
to
attack
the
act's
validity
to
accept
the
south
carolina
legislature's
uncontested
findings,
as
the
court
put
it,
at
new
constructions
in
the
coastal
zone
threatened
a
valuable
public
resource.
the
court
ruled
that
when
land
use
regulation
is
designed
to
prevent
"harmful
or
noxious
uses"
or
real
estate
akin
to
public
nuisances,
no
compensation
is
owing
under
the
takings
clause
regardless
of
the
regulation's
effect
on
the
real
estate's
value.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
we
find
that
the
state
supreme
court
erred
in
applying
the
harmful
or
noxious
uses
principle
to
decide
this
case.
our
prior
cases
have
said
that
regulations
which
deny
the
property
owner
all
economically
viable
use
of
his
land
categorically
require
compensation
regardless
of
the
public
interest
advanced
by
the
regulation.
although
the
court
has
never
actually
applied
this
principle,
or
even
set
forth
the
theoretical
justification
for
it,
we
think
it
is
correct
and
must
be
retained.
physically
appropriating
land
and
depriving
the
owner
of
all
beneficial
use
of
it
seem
to
us
practically
and
economically
equivalent.
the
council
insists
that
state
regulations
aimed
at
harmful
uses
of
land
are
accepted
from
our
categorical
statements
requiring
compensation
for
total
takings.
our
review
of
the
relevant
decisions
demonstrates,
however,
at
the
harmful
or
noxious
use
principle
was
merely
this
court's
early
formulation
of
the
police
power
justification
necessary
to
sustain
without
compensation
any
regulatory
diminution
in
value.
in
view
of
that
pedigree
and
since
the
distinction
between
regulation
that
prevents
harmful
use
and
that
which
confers
benefits
is
difficult,
if
not,
impossible
to
draw
on
an
objective
value-free
basis.
we
conclude
that
contention
use
of
harmful
use
cannot
justify
a
departure
from
the
categorical
rule
that
a
regulatory
taking
depriving
land
of
all
its
beneficial
use
must
be
compensated.
we
hold,
therefore,
that
if
south
carolina
is
to
resist
compensation
for
depriving
lucas
of
all
beneficial
use
of
his
beachfront
lots,
it
must
show
that
the
beneficial
use
is
proscribed
by
the
beachfront
management
act
were
not
part
of
lucas'
estate
to
begin
with.
that,
we
think
is
in
accord
with
this
court?s
takings
jurisprudence
which
has
long
been
guided
by
citizen's
historic
understandings
regarding
the
content
of
the
bundle
of
rights
that
they
acquire
when
they
take
title
to
property.
because
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
historical
compact
embodied
in
the
takings
clause
that
tittle
to
real
estate
is
held
subject
to
the
state's
subsequent
decision
to
eliminate
all
economically
beneficial
use.
a
regulation
having
such
an
effect
cannot
be
newly
decreed
without
paying
compensation
to
the
owner.
however,
no
compensation
is
owed
in
this
setting,
as
in
all
others,
if
the
effect
of
the
state's
law
or
regulation
is
simply
to
make
explicit
what
already
is
in
here
in
the
title
itself,
that
is,
the
restrictions
that
background
principles
of
the
state?s
law
of
property
and
nuisance
already
placed
upon
land
ownership.
although
it
seems
unlikely
that
without
enactment
of
the
beachfront
management
act,
the
common
law
principles
would
have
prevented
the
erection
of
any
habitable
or
productive
improvements
on
lucas'
land,
that
state
law
question
must
be
dealt
with
on
remand.
we
caution,
however,
that
to
win
its
case,
south
carolina
cannot
simply
recite
the
legislature's
declaration
that
the
use,
as
lucas
desires,
are
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
or
the
conclusory
assertion
that
those
uses
violate
a
common
law
maxim
such
as
sic
utere
tuo
ut
alienum
non
laedas.
rather,
it
must
identify
background
principles
of
nuisance
and
property
law
that
when
applied
in
an
objectively
reasonable
manner,
exclude
lucas'
intended
uses
in
the
lands'
present
circumstances.
only
on
that
showing
can
south
carolina
fairly
claim
that
the
beachfront
management
act
is
taking
nothing.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions
and
justice
souter
has
filed
a
separate
statement.
