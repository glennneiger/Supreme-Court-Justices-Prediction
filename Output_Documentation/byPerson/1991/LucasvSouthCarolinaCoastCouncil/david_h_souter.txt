justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
subject
of
concessions,
do
you,
or
did
you
concede
that
discouraging
construction...
and
i'm
referring,
by
the
way,
to
the
findings
set
out
on
page
16
of
the
red
brief...
that
discouraging
the
construction
near
the
beach
dune
area
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
great
public
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lewis,
may
i
ask
you
two
factual
questions.
i
seem
to
recall
that
somewhere
in
the
record
there's
an
indication
that
at
some
point
in
the
recallable
past,
maybe
10
or
15
years
ago,
your
land
was
under
water
at
one
point.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
has
disappeared
naturally
in
the
meantime.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me
ask
you
my
second
question.
you
spoke
of
the...
what
i
think
you
refer...
you
described
as
the
finding
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
the
development
of
the
land
would
be
detrimental
to
public
welfare,
safety,
health,
and
so
on.
and
you
said
that
finding
came
out
of
the
blue.
was
that
finding
possibly
based
on,
and
simply
a
kind
of
an
interpretation
of
this
record
evidence
that
at
one
point
some
of
your
land,
at
least,
was
inundated?
or
in
the
alternative,
was
that
so-called
finding
simply
a
statement
in
a
shorthand
kind
of
way
that
that's
what
the
legislature
had
found,
and
there
was
at
least
a
reasonable
or
non-reviewable
basis
for
so
finding?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
may
have
used
that,
you
may
not
have.
about
the
rest
of
my
question,
whether
it's
a
finding
or
a
labeling,
a,
was
it
referring
back
to
the
period
of
inundation?
and
b,
if
it
was
not,
is
it
fair
to
read
it
as,
in
effect,
a
restatement
of
the
findings
of
the
legislature
with
the
assumption
that
those
findings
were
reasonable
or
at
least
non-reviewable?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
can't
assume
that
that
purpose
applies
in
this
case,
can
we,
because
the...
isn't
the
effect
of
the...
what
was
it,
the
1990
amendments,
indicates
that
that
purpose
is
in
fact
not
going
to
be
realized
in
every
case,
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
made
provision
for
exceptions,
so
we
can't
assume
that
that
is
necessarily
a
fact
that
applies
to
this
case,
can
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
the
rare
and
unusual
circumstances
would
be
circumstances
in
which
building
on
a
given
lot
would
not
pose
a
threat
of
harm
to
the
public.
that's
the
circumstance,
isn't
it,
and
we
have
to
assume
that
that
is
possible.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
be
possible
on
this
lot.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
who
issued...
maybe
i'm
just
playing
with
words
here.
who
issues
the
permits
in
the
cases
where
an
exception
is
made
under
the
amendments?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
it's
the
14-member
commission
that
can
go
up
and
down
the
coast
if
there's
a
request
for
a
permit
and
decide
whether
in
a
given
case
there
would
be
harm
to
the
public
in
building.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
hasn't
been
done
here,
so
we
can't
assume
what
the
result
would
be.
