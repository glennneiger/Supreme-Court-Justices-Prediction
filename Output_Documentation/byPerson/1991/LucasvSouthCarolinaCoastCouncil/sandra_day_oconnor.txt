mr.
lewis,
could
we
change
direction
here
a
moment,
and
may
i
inquire,
there
was
a
law
passed
subsequently
that...
under
which
south
carolina
provided
that
a
property
owner
affected
by
this
earlier
regulation
could
apply
for
a
permit
to
build
nonetheless
with
certain
conditions
attached,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
petitioner
ever
apply
for
such
a
permit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't...
to
the
extent
that
you
are
arguing
there
is
a
permanent
taking
here,
regulatory
taking,
don't
our
cases
indicate
that
perhaps
it's
not
right
unless
and
until
the
application
for
an
exemption
has
been
sought?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
did
that
finding
determine
the
effect
of
this
new
exemption
permit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
slow
down
a
minute.
at
the
time
the
stipulation
was
filed
the
permit
law
had
not
yet
been
enacted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
mr.
lewis,
you
do
have
a
fall-back
position,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
if
we
don't
agree
with
that
and
think
there
is
a
nuisance
exception,
that
this
doesn't
fall
within
it,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
harness,
with
reference
to
the
adjacent
homes,
the
homes
that
have
been
built
on
adjacent
property.
i
guess
under
your
theory
south
carolina
could
require
those
homes
to
be
removed
because
it
still
is
the
same
threat
to
public
safety
that
exists
with
respect
to
allowing
new
construction
on
these
lots.
isn't
that
right?
wouldn't
your
theory
take
you
that
far?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i
know
that's
typical.
i
am
saying,
if
i
understand
your
theory,
it
would
permit
the
state
to
require
existing
homes
to
be
removed,
and
no
compensation
paid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
your
theory
go
that
far?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
what's
the
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
talking
policy
issues
that
could
be
addressed
by
a
legislative
body,
but
you're
not
addressing
the
limits
of
the
constitution
at
all,
by
that
response.
and
i
think
what
we
are
interested
in
is
what
are
the
constitutional
limits
to
state
action,
that
is
why
we
are
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
trying
to
have
you
describe
for
us
what
limitations
there
are
under
your
view
of
what
the
constitution
requires
with
the
takings
clause.
it
would...
nothing
you
have
said
gives
me
any
concept
of
where
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
would
you
like
to
try
to
spell
that
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
the
danger
is
to
the
property
owner
himself
or
herself
as
to
construction
on
a
particular
site,
either
because
it's
too
steep
and
the
house
will
slide
away
with
the
next
rain,
or
because
it's
on
an
earthquake
faultline,
or
because
it's
on
a
shoreline,
not
concerned
with
the
neighbors
or
other
people,
just
with
the
safety
of
the
people
who
would
build
on
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
could
prevent
new
construction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
can
you
require
the
person
living
in
an
unsafe
dwelling
to
totally
remove
it?
it's
not
safe
because
the
next
rain
is
going
to
come
and
your
beautiful
house,
on
which
you
have
spent
a
million
dollars,
is
going
to
slide
down
the
mountain,
so
we
tell
you
to
take
it
down,
now.
compensation
or
no
compensation?
