blackmun
so
you
feel
it
was
completely
worthless.
justice
blackmun
would
you
be
willing
to
give
it
to
me?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we're
throwing
around
the
term
no
economic
viability
of
this
property.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
viable
is
a
good
medical
term,
it
isn't
a
legal
term,
but
the
lawyers
have
taken
it
over
and
the
judges
too.
what
do
you
mean
by
economic
viability?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it's
a
matter
of
valuation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
hardly
the
medical
definition
of
an
old-time
term
of
being
viable.
