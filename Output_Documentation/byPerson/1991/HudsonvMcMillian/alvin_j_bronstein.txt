mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent,
by
appointment
of
this
court,
the
petitioner,
keith
hudson,
a
prisoner
at
the
louisiana
state
penitentiary
at
angola,
louisiana.
on
the
night
of
october
30,
1983,
mr.
hudson
had
an
exchange
of
words
with
one
of
the
respondents,
sergeant
mcmillian.
the
officer
decided
to
give
hudson
a
disciplinary
charge,
two
charges
i
believe,
and
to
comport
with
the
policy,
mcmillian
then
called
another
officer,
the
respondent
sergeant
woods
and
again,
by
virtue
of
policy,
called
their
ranking
superior,
lieutenant
mezo.
the
officers
placed
hudson
in
full
restraints
before
moving
in
to
a
disciplinary
cell
which
is
referred
to
in
the
record
as
the
dungeon.
full
restraints
consisted
of
handcuffs,
attached
to
waist
chains
and
shackles
or
leg
irons.
in
other
words,
hudson
was
essentially
immobilized.
the
two
sergeants
then
led
hudson
out
of
his
cell,
down
a
corridor
and
out
of
sight
of
any
other
prisoners
in
their
cells.
they
stopped,
and
at
that
point
the
two
sergeants,
both
of
whom
were
over
6
feet
tall
and
each
weighing
200
or
more
pounds,
began
to
beat
the
petitioner.
sergeant
woods
held
him
from
behind
and
hit
him
in
the
back.
mcmillian
repeatedly
punched
hudson
about
the
face,
mouth,
and
chest.
lieutenant
mezo
stood
by
and
observing
the
beating
and
saying
only,
quote:
"don't
be
having
too
much
fun,
boys.
"
hudson
sustained
some
injuries,
bruises
and
swelling
to
his
face,
mouth
and
lip;
a
split
lower
lip;
and
a
cracked
dental
plate,
a
few
bruises
on
his
body.
after
the
beating
ended
he
was
taken
and
thrown
into
the
disciplinary
cell.
he
brought
a
pro
se
action
under
the
civil
rights
act,
and
the
case
proceeded
to
a
full
trial.
the
trial
court,
after
reviewing
the
testimony
of
various
witnesses
and
certain
exhibits,
they
heard
from
a
number
of
prisoners,
a
number
of
officers,
found
essentially
the
facts
that
i
have
just
recited.
the
trial
court
went
on
to
find
that
there
was
no
need
to
use
any
force
because
the
petitioner
was
already
in
restraints,
that
the
force
used
was
excessive,
and
that
the
respondents'
conduct
was,
quote:
"can
only
be
seen
as
motivated
by
malice.
"
the
court
found
that
hudson's
eight
amendment
rights
were
violated
and
awarded
him
$800
in
compensatory
damages.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
any
of
the
findings...
the
trial
court's
factual
findings.
indeed,
it
repeated
them
and
deplored
the
use
of
unnecessary
force
in
the
treatment
of
prisoners,
calling
it
a
blight
on
the
criminal
justice
system.
the
fifth
circuit
stated
that
because
no
force
was
required
in
this
case,
the
force
used
was
objectively
unreasonable.
the
conduct
of
the
respondents,
the
court
said,
and
again
i
quote:
"qualified
as
clearly
excessive
and
occasioned
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
"
end
quote.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
because
it
found
that
hudson
did
not
suffer
a
significant
injury,
one
prong
of
a
four-element
standard
for
eighth
amendment
violations,
constructed
by
the
fifth
circuit,
without
any
reference
to
any
decision
of
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
refers
only
to
a
prior
eighth
amendment
decision
in
its
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
in
turn
relies
solely
on
a
fourth
amendment
case
in
the
circuit
that
misreads
this
court's
decision
in
graham
v.
connor.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
the
other
factors
are
rather
confusing.
they
seem
to
be
interrelated.
one
must
be
related
to
the
other--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that,
justice
o'connor,
in
this
case
because
whatever
the
standard
is--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--i
think
in
this
case
where
there
was
no
penalogical
justification
for
the
behavior
of
the
officers,
where
there
was
no
emergency,
where
there
was
no
tense
situation,
there
was
no
need
to
make
split-second
decisions,
the
test
ought
to
be
deliberate
indifference:
that
is,
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
whitley--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--it
does
fit,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
necessary
standard
in
this
case
under
these
facts.
whitley
is
a
situation
where
you
had
a
major
disturbance.
you
still
had
a
hostage.
you
had
officers
and
prisoners
milling
around.
the
officer
had
to
make
a
decision
when
he
saw
the
prisoner
running
up
the
stairs--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--it's
similar.
medical--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--well,
i
don't
recall
seeing
significant
harm
in
estelle,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
had
to
be
shown.
there
had
to
be
the
unnecessary...
the
objective
element
was
some
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
pain...
you
can
have
pain
without
actual
injury,
without
harm.
you
can
have
it
momentary.
in
this
case,
if
instead
of
administering
the
beating,
they
had
hooked
up
the
prisoner
to
the
tucker
telephone
that's
described
in
a
number
of
this
court's
opinions,
there
would
have
a
been
a
great
deal
of
pain,
or
some
pain,
but
no
injury.
so
i
think
the
test
is
closer
to
estelle
under
these
facts
that
it
is
to
whitley.
as
i
respectfully
said
in
the
beginning,
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
whatever
the
test
is,
it's
met.
the
trial
court
found
malice.
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
that's
wrong
is
to
construct
an
extra
constitutional
requirement
without
any
support
in
the
history
of
the
eighth
amendment
or
in
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
has
never
focused
on
significant
injury
in
eight
amendment
cases,
but
rather
on
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
injury
in
fact?
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
injury
goes...
it's
probative
of
damages.
it
is
probative
of
the
state
of
mind--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
you
need...
if
you're
talking
about
physical
injury...
that
may
be
where
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things.
there
has
to
be
some
hurt,
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
there
has
to
be
some
hurt,
which
can
be
psychic
pain.
it
can
be
physical
injury.
it
can
be
physical
pain
without
injury.
but,
yes,
under
that
definition,
there
has
to
be
some
injury.
i
think
it's
important
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case
because
that
helps
us
get
to
the
standard
issue.
there
are
no
substantial
deference
concerns
because
there
was
no
disturbance.
it
was
not
a
tense
situation.
there
were
no
security
problems
and,
therefore,
there
was
no
penalogical
justification
for
the
conduct
of
the
respondents,
found
by
both
lower
courts.
this
was
not
a
spontaneous
incident
involving
split-second
decisions,
but
rather
a
carefully
planned
and
brutal
attempt
to
cause
fear,
pain,
suffering,
humiliation,
and
injury.
they
set
out...
the
respondents
set
out
to
teach
hudson
a
lesson,
and
that
was
to
punish
him.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no.
the
eighth
amendment
only
applies
after
conviction.
he
would
have
had--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--a
substance
due
process
claim
or
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
that
would
be
graham
v.
connor.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
this
court
has
said
it
changes
that
way
upon
conviction.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
on
the
contrary.
the
policy
of
the
prison
is
not
to
administer--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--well--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--respectfully,
i
disagree.
i
think
if
you
look
at
all
other
cases
we
talk
about
guards
as
being
officials.
in
the
context
of
a
facility
like
this,
a
prison
guard,
and
these
were
sergeants
and
one
lieutenant,
they
administer
on
behalf
of
the
state
an
enormous
amount
of
authority
and
power.
they
have
power
and
authority
over
the
prisoner,
the
prisoner's
life
and
every
moment
of
that
day.
they
called
their
superior
officer;
he
is
referred
to
in
the
record
as
"rank".
that's
the
expression
they
used.
so
clearly
a
lieutenant
is
a
very
senior
officer
there.
but
we
have
no
derivative
liability
claim
here.
we
don't
have
an
issue
of
whether
the
state
is
liable.
we
have
no
issue
of
whether
superior
officers
are
liable
because
of
the
actions
of
the
lower
officials.
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
he
sued
only
the
respondents
individually.
they
were
given
a
certain
amount
of
authority
and
power
by
the
state.
there
is
no
color
of
state
law
issue
in
this
case,
so
i
don't
see
any
problem
about
policy
being
involved
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
official
policy
would
be
that
you
don't
beat
up
prisoners.
but
as
it
apparently
happened,
these
guards
did
beat
up
a
prisoner.
they
are
liable
because
they
beat
him
up,
because
the
state
gave
him...
gave
them
the
authority
or
the
power
to
do
it.
they
were
wearing
the
uniforms.
they
had
the
power
to
put
this
person...
they
were
engaged
in,
in
the
language
that
you
yourself
used,
justice
scalia,
in
west,
where
you
were
concerned
about...
west
v.
atkins...
you
were
concerned
about
the
doctor,
the
private
physician,
who
didn't
have
any
supervisory
role,
nor
did
he
have
any
penalogical
role,
although
the
majority
of
the
court
disagreed
with
you...
your
characterization
of
that.
but
here
these
officers
did
have
penalogical
roles;
that's
what
they
do.
they
discipline
prisoners,
and
they
remove
prisoners.
they
put
them
in
restraints.
that
is
accepted
practice,
to
put
people
in
restraints
at
a
maximum
security
unit
before
you
move
them.
and
then
they
beat
him
on
their
way
to
discharging
their
other
authorities.
the
beating
is
what
we
are
complaining
about.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
yes,
i
think
a
pre-trial
detainee
would
win
under
a
substantive
due
process
claim.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
theoretically
he
could,
but
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
said
that
the
substantive
due
process
right
of
a
sentenced
prisoner
is
redundant,
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
the
one
we
must
look
to.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that's
right.
that
would
meet
webster.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt,
justice
white.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
webster
says
to
punish
is
to
cause
to
undergo
pain,
loss,
or
suffering.
well,
they
caused
him
pain
and
suffering
in
this
case,
and
they
did
it
in
the
eighth
amendment
context
because
they
were
wearing
uniforms
and
they
were
engaged
in,
at
least
in
part,
what
they
are
supposed
to
do.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
and
he
was
in
prison.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
graham
v.
connor--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--the
fourth--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--there
is
a
lot
of
dicta
in
more
recent
cases
about
that.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
there
is
some
discussion
of
that,
the
pre-trial
equivalent
of
chapman...
rhodes
v.
chapman.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
yes,
ingraham...
in
ingraham,
the
court
said
that.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
so,
but
again,
this
court
keeps
making
it
clear
that
eighth
amendment
is
the
appropriate
standard
when
you
are
talking
about
a
sentenced
prisoner--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--undergo
pain,
loss,
or
suffering.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
yes.
then
we
get
to
the
eighth
amendment,
the
cloaking
with
authority
and
that
becomes
punishment
in
eighth
amendment
terms.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
have
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
thank
the
court
for
hearing
me.
