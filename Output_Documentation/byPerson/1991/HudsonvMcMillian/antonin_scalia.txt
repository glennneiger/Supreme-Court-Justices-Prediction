justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bronstein,
suppose...
well,
punish
him
or...
suppose
the
same
thing
had
happened
after
he
was
arrested
but
before
he
had
been
convicted,
he
got
beat
up
by
some
prison
guards,
would
he
have
had
an
eighth
amendment
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
it
change
that
way,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
any
indication
in
this
case
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
prison
to
punish
people
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
any
of
these
officials
at
the
policy
level
of
the
prison?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason
i
am
asking
is,
i
mean,
assuming
we
agree
with
you
on
the,
you
know,
extent
of
the
injury
point,
i
just
wonder
whether
we
should
remand
for
some
further
findings
by
the
district
court.
i
mean,
i
am
particularly
referring
to
what
we
said
in
wilson
v.
seiter,
that
deprivation
does
not
constitute
punishment
if
prison
officials...
neither
knew
nor
had
reason
to
know
about
it.
i
think
we
might
by
officials
something
more
than
a
prison
guard.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bronstein,
with
apologies
to
mr.
webster,
that
definition
you
read,
it
says
to
cause...
what
was
it
again?
to
cause--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
mean,
when
i
accidentally
hit
somebody
with
my
car,
i
cause
that
effect,
and
i...
you
know,
i
would
not
say
that
i
punished
that
person.
i
would
say
i
hurt
the
person.
doesn't
punishment
have
some
further--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
we
have
held
that
everything
that
happens
to
you
when
you
are
in
prison
is
not
punishment,
so
you
could
be
made...
you
could
be
caused
to
suffer
pain
by
your
confinement
unintentionally,
without
that
being
punishment.
why
isn't
there
an
additional
requirement
that
even
if
somebody
intends
to
cause
it,
it
has
to
be
the
somebody
who
has
some
responsibility
for
establishing
penal
policy
for
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
any
other
causes
of
action
you
have
don't
depend
on
the
eighth
amendment.
i
mean,
i
assume
you
have
an
assault
cause
of
action
against
somebody
who
does
this
thing?
why
is
it
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
eighth
amendment
only
applies
to
punishment
by
the
state.
it
doesn't
apply
to
punishment
by
my
mother
or
punishment
by
someone
else.
don't
you
have
to
tie
this
to
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
show
more
than
state
action.
you
have
to
show
state
punishment.
when
the
heat
goes
off
by
accident
in
the
prison
and
the
prisoners
are
very
cold,
painfully
cold,
for
several
days,
that's
state
action.
the
state
keeps
them
there
and
doesn't
heat
the
prison,
but
it
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
because
there
is
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
state
as
a
state
to
punish.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
punishment
by
the
state?
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
just
because
an
individual...
whenever
an
individual
employee
of
the
state
goes
beyond
his
authority
and
acts
in
this
way,
is
it
reasonable
to
say
that
is
punishment
by
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
punishment
for
a
crime?
then
why
in
bell
v.
wolfish
couldn't
you
have
used
the
eighth
amendment?
does
it
have
to
be
punishment
inflicted
because
of
the
conviction
and
because
of
your
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
that's
my
point.
why
is
that,
because
the
punishment
has
to
be
a
punishment
inflicted
for
a
crime
that
you
have
been
convicted
of
and
sentenced
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
doesn't
then
there
is
no
explanation
for
bell
v.
wolfish.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
hurdle
you
referred
to,
it
seems
to
me
the
very
nature
of
the
hurdle
is,
look
at
the
kind
of
punishment
the
eighth
amendment
refers
to
is
only
punishment
for
the
conviction
of
a
crime.
that's
the
nature
of
those
decisions,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
certainly
above
de
minimis,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
saying
this
was
de
minimis.
you
are
saying
it
was
constitutionally
de
minimis?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
was
the
warden
of
the
prison
that
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
know
that
one
was
a
lieutenant,
wasn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
what
difference
the
warden
would
make.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
state
statute,
he
has...
he
has
authority
to
establish
policy,
but
he
doesn't
have
authority
to
repeal
a
state
statute,
does
he,
if
you
say
there
is
a
state
statute
against
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
wouldn't
really
matter
if
the
governor
did
it
even,
he
can't
repeal
the
state
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--like
a
lieutenant?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
this
lieutenant,
anyway--
[laughter]
