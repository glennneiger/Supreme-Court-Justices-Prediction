justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
essential
for
you
to
win
to
win
under...
to
win
on
the
eighth
amendment?
would
a
pre-trial
detainee
win
in
this
case
under
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
your
client
could
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
are
saying...
you
say,
it
is
just
as
obvious
as
can
be
that
this
is
punishment--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
was
in
prison?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't...
you
don't
deny,
i
suppose,
that
the
officers
intended
to
discipline
this
man?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
they
expected
to
get
him
to
obey
or
get
him
to
do
something,
to...
didn't
they
want
to
alter
his
conduct
in
some
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
i
suppose
if
they
intended
to
discipline
him
or
affect
his
conduct
some
way
or
deter
a
repetition
of
his
conduct,
they
would
want
to
make
sure
that
they
did
something
to
him
besides
inflict
a
frivolous
injury...
i
mean,
just
a
de
minimis
thing.
that
wouldn't
affect
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
these
people
just
enjoyed
being
cruel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
certainly
then
intended
to
let
him
know
how
they
felt--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
you
don't
do
that
by
just
de
minimis
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
beat
him
so
that
they
broke
his
shoulder?
they
broke
his
shoulder.
would
that
violate
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
intend
to
beat
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
they...
well,
you
are
stuck
with
the
findings,
i
guess--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right,
let's
be
stuck
with
them.
don't
you
suppose
they
intended
to
beat
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
they
intend
to
punish
him
for
his
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then,
if
a
significant
injury
as
you
would
define
it,
were
to
be
inflicted
by
an
individual
prison
guard,
contrary
to
prison
policy
and
it
is
something
that
he
himself
could
be
disciplined
for,
you
say
that
would
be
an
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment...
if
there
was
a
significant
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
already
had
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
getting
to
a
significant
injury...
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
would
accept
it,
i
suppose.
if
it
were
a
significant
injury
it
would
state
a
1983
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
won't
quote
you.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
a
lieutenant?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
prison
or
just
in
the
army?
