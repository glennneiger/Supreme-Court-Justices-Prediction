justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
school
spanking
case,
where
the
court
drew
the
line
between
convictions
and
punishment,
pre-conviction
punishment.
they
said
they
might
well
be
covered
by
substantive
due
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
before
you
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
know
what
your
answer
would
have
been
to
this
case...
do
you
think
this
prisoner
would
have
had
a
cause
of
action
if
he
had
been
pre-trial
detainee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
supposing
they'd
beaten
him
and
he
had
just
stumbled
after
they
hit
him
in
the
face
or
something
and
he
broke
his
shoulder
in
the
fall
rather...
they
didn't
try
to
break
his
shoulder.
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
causation
is
perfectly
clear.
he
got
hit
in
the
face
and
he
fell
down
and
he
broke
his
shoulder
when
he
fell,
but
the
officer
didn't
try
to
break
his
shoulder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
in
my
hypothetical
the
broken
shoulder
is...
to
use
justice
scalia's
approach
is
clearly
not
a
part
of
the
intended
punishment.
the
intended
punishment
was
the
same
bruises
you
have
got
here,
and
then
accidentally
he
broke
his
shoulder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
three
of
them
got
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
didn't
the
magistrate
find
they
also
beat
up
the
witness
allen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
not
exactly
a
single
incident.
