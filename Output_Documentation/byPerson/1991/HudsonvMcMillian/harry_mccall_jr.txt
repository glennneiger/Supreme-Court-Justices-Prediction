mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
respectfully,
obviously,
differ
with
our
friends,
and
we
would
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
fifth
circuit
test
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
in
particular
with
wilson
against
seiter.
let
me,
if
i
may,
remind
you
gentlemen
that
this
is
the
question
that
the
court
asked
in
its
grant
of
certiorari.
that
question
was--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
the
answer
to
that
is--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--no,
we
don't.
we
say
that
it
is
constitutionally
de
minimis.
now,
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
mean
to
be
chopping
logic
with
you,
your
honor,
but
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that,
first,
let's
consider
this
conduct.
in
the
finding
of
the
trial
court,
it
was
that
there
were
minor
bruises
and
swelling
to
the
face,
mouth,
and
lip
and
damage
to
the
dental
plate.
this
is
from
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix.
there
were
minor
injuries
to
the
back
and
mouth
and
a
strange
feeling
while
eating
for
several
months.
this
at
pages
28
and
29
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
think
my
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
there
must
be
some
physical...
in
the
case
of
a
beating,
and
let
me
confine
it
to
that,
some
physical
evidence
of
the
alleged
physical
violence.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
that
doesn't
follow.
forgive
me,
your
honor--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--it
doesn't
follow.
i
was
coming
to
that.
you
have
two
types
of
traces,
if
you
will,
from
injuries.
you
have
a
beating
such
as
this
or
such
as
this
is
alleged
to
have
been,
which
i
think
everyone
would
expect
to
leave
some
traces.
you
heard
mr.
bronstein
talk
with
eloquence
about
the
two
6-foot
guards
who
were
pummeling
this
man
and
hit
him,
according
to
the
record,
maybe
9
or
10
times
in
the
face.
he
was
examined
by
the
medical
technician
2
days
later,
and
he
found
only
minor
bruises.
now,
we
would
submit
that
as
to
that
type
of
episode
that
you
would
expect
a
physical
trace.
now,
let
us--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
think
that
what
you
are
suggesting
is
a
conflict,
if
you
will--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
with
due
deference.
what
i
have
not
said
is
beating
him
incontinently,
because
while
we
appreciate
the
fact
that
we
must
accept
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
here,
we
do
not
agree
with
it.
you
will
recall
that
the
record
shows
that
both
these
guards
denied
any
sort
of
beating.
now,
we
are
stuck
with
the
fact
that
there
was
a
finding.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
almost
exactly,
your
honor.
the
findings...
the
finding
was
that
it
was
not
an
isolated
incident.
the
basis
for
that
was
the
remark
made
by
the
magistrate
in
his
opinion
that
they
had
also
beaten
another
prisoner.
there
was
no
suggestion,
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence,
there's
nothing
in
the
magistrate's
finding
that
this
was
a
practice
or
a
pattern.
i
think
that
the
entire
basis
for
that
statement
was,
as
i
say,
the
off-hand
remark
that
the
other
prisoner
was
also
beaten,
as
to
which
we
have
no
evidence
and
nothing
but
the
passing
remark
by
the
magistrate.
but
let
me
come
back,
if
i
may,
to
your
original
question.
is
there
any
objection
to
the
administration
of
some
sort
of
treatment
or
some...
something
that
gives
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
doesn't
leave
a
trace?
no.
because
what
we
say
is
that
you
have
a
different
standard,
if
you
will,
where
the
violation
consists
of
a
physical
beating,
which
would
normally
leave
traces,
or
one
which
was
calculated
not
to
leave
traces,
because
we
all
know,
to
the
shame
of
our
system,
that
there
are
methods
of
torturing
or
punishing
people
that
leave
no
traces.
as
to
those,
if
the
testimony
is
that
there
was
intense
suffering,
say,
but
that
the
nature
of
the
procedure
was
such
that
it
left
no
marks,
then
we
do
not
urge
this
test
of
a...
an
observable
significant
injury.
what
we're
saying
is,
and
we
would
respectfully
enjoin
the
court
to
bear
this
in
mind.
we
are
saying
that
where
there
is
a
physical
invasion,
if
you
will,
a
physical
maltreatment
of
a
prisoner
which
would
normally
be
expected
to
leave
some
sort
of
traces,
that
then
there
must
have
been
a
significant
injury.
now,
that
doesn't
exclude
a
significant
injury
that
doesn't
leave
traces.
for
example,
in
your
estelle
case,
there
was
no
physical
trace,
but
what
they
said
was
that
studied
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs
could
lead
to
a
condition
which
would
be
sufficiently
detrimental,
if
you
will,
sufficiently
harmful
to
the
prisoner
to
warrant
invoking
the
eighth
amendment.
by
the
same
token,
in
the
conditions
of
confinement,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
physical
deterioration
on
the
part
of
the
prisoners,
but
the
test
there
is
not
the
marks,
if
you
will--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--my
answer
to
it
is
that
the
difference
is
that
in
whitley
there
is
no
question
but
what
there
was
a
serious
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
the
man
was
shot.
you
can't
get
much
more
serious
than
that.
so
that
whitley
is
where
we
differ--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--well,
i'm
saying
that
whitley
itself
had
to
do
with
a
more
serious
injury,
and
i
think
that
the
difference--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--if
i
recall
whitley,
your
honor,
the
court...
your
honors
held
that
there
was
the...
clearly
the...
more
than
significant
injury
and
they
held
that
that
injury
however
did
not
constitute
a
constitutional
deprivation
because
of
the
absence
of
the
subjective
element.
so
that
i
don't
think
you
can
go
off
entirely
on
the
physical...
on
the
objective,
or
entirely
on
the
subjective.
and
this,
as
i
recall,
was
the
lesson
of
wilson
against
seiter,
that
you
have
both
objective
and
subjective.
now,
clearly,
in
whitley
you
had...
you
satisfied
the
objective
test,
but
the
subjective
test
was
not
satisfied.
now,
what
we
say
here
is
that
perhaps
there
may
have
been
satisfaction
of
the
subjective
test,
but
the
objective
test
was
not
satisfied.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
injuries
were
so
slight.
now
as
i
say,
coming
back
again
to
your
question,
there
can
be
injuries
which
are
more
than
slight
which
don't
leave
any
trace,
such
for
example
as
the
application
of
electric
shocks
or
things
like
that.
that,
then,
is
a
matter
of
testimony.
but
this
is
why
it
is
so
important
to
i
think
this
court
and
to
courts
generally
to
have
a
test
which
is
one
which
can
be
applied
and
can
be
practically
be
applied.
how
do
you
sort
out
those
claims
which
are
purely
frivolous?
your
honors
will
recall
that
judge
friendly,
in
that
classic
case,
that
not
every
push
or
shove--
now,
what
this
test
purports
to
do
is
to
eliminate
the
push
or
shove
which
is
not...
one
which
is
not
of
sufficient
seriousness.
regrettably,
as
we
know
in
a
prison
situation,
it's
not
like
it
is
in
this
room.
there
is,
at
the
very
least,
animosity.
there
is
at
the
very
least
a
lack
of
cooperation,
and
i
think
as
judge
friendly
said,
the
prison
population
is
not
one
which
is
normally
a
peaceful
or
easy
population
to
get
along
with.
there
is
animosity
on
the
part
of
the
guards.
if
a
prisoner
is
moved
from
one
place
to
another,
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
he's
going
to
drag
his
feet,
so
to
speak.
now
at
what
point
does
it
become
an
invasion
of
his
constitutional
rights
if
he
is
urged
along?
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that...
and
first,
let
me
say
that
there
are
two
questions
presented
by
the
question
which
your
honors
said,
what
is
the
proper
test
to
apply?
conceivably,
your
honors
could
decide,
yes,
that
is
the
proper
test,
but
that
in
this
case,
this
particular
case,
that
the
test...
the
criterion
was
met.
we
don't
think
so.
but
what
we
do
say
to
you
is
that
this
test
is
consistent
with
those
decisions
that
i
have
mentioned,
and
in
particular
those
decisions,
estelle,
rhodes,
whitley,
and
wilson.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
suppose
that
is
a
question
of
definition,
justice
white.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
really
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
just
that
they
were
annoyed
with
him
because
they
felt
that
they
had...
he
had
given
them
lip,
so
to
speak,
and
they
were
just
going
to
show
him
or
whether
they
hoped
that
this
would
have
a
salutary
effect
on
future
conduct.
that...
i
can't
answer
that--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
suppose
you
could
say
so,
but
let
us
take
for
example--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--no,
i
am
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
but
i
am
saying
i
can't
answer
your
question
to
exclude
the
fact
that
maybe
they
were
simply
venting
their
impatience,
their
anger
on
him
and
were
not--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--no
question
about
that,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
conceivably
you
could.
it
depends
on
the
message.
take,
for
example,
the
traditional
thing,
where
you--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor.
let
us
assume
the
old
thing,
that
you
go
in
and
you
see
somebody
and
you
say...
like
this
you
are
conveying
a
message
and
you
are
not
certainly
inflicting
an
injury.
the
seriousness
of
it,
i
think,
is
simply
a
measure
of
how
do
you
get
your
message
across?
now,
i'm...
this
is
why
i
have
difficulty
with
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
saying...
or
their
mental
process
was,
we
are
going
to
show
this
so-and-so
that
he
can't
do
this
to
us
or
whether
they
were
just
saying,
i've
had
it.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
clearly
it
would.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
because
he
had
a
significant
injury.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
think
you
then
get
into
a
question
of
causation,
justice
stevens--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--all
right,
in
that
case,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
yes,
that
there
is
an
eighth
amendment
violation
because
you
have...
once
you
establish
a
causation
factor,
whether
it
was
intended
that
he
should
fall
or
whether
the
fall
was
the
result
of
what
they
intended
to
do,
that
comes
back
to
the
basic
legal--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
think
the
legal
principle
is
that
you
intend
those
consequences
which
would
logically
follow
from
your
action.
and
if
you
administer
a
blow,
the
severity
of
which
is
such
that
it
will
cause
a
fracture,
then
you
intend
that.
but
i
am
trying
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice,
what
was
the
intent
of
the
guards
here.
i
don't
know
whether
the
guards
were
simply
angry
or--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--did
they
beat
him?
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i'm
sure
they
did.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
a
beating
by
itself
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
deprivation
unless--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
even
so
because
i
think
that
the
objective
test
is
not
in
any
way
affected
by
the
intention
of
the
person
who
is
administering
the
beating.
so
that
let
us
assume
that
they
were,
as
you
say,
saying,
we
are
going
to
beat
him,
we
are
going
to
punish
him
in
our
own.
i
doubt
that
they
did.
i
suspect
that
what
they
did
was
that...
i
don't
know
whether,
as
somebody
had
suggested
earlier
today,
they
got
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed
or
what--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--all
right,
mr.
justice
stevens.
but
the
point
is,
clearly
this
would
not
have
happened
unless
there
had
been
strong
feelings,
and
whether
those
were
motivated
by
a
desire
to
shall
i
say
discipline
the
prisoner
or
whether
they
were
simply
venting
their
anger,
i
think
doesn't
really
change
the
question
here.
the
question
is,
did
this
beating
which
was
subsequently
determined
to
have
left
nothing
but
minor
bruises
and
swelling
to
the
face,
mouth,
and
lip,
did
that
constitute
a
significant
injury?
that's
the
specific
question.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
no,
i
don't
say
that,
although
it
has
led
to
that.
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
because--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--you're
getting
to
the
other
qualification
of
the
court's
question
and
that
question
was,
a
single
incident
of
force.
now,
what
we
would
say
as
to
your
question
is,
no.
and
the
reason
we
would
say
no
is
that
that
would
not
constitute
an
action
by
the
state,
because
it
was...
first,
you
said,
let
us
assume
it
was
contrary
to
regulations.
clearly,
it
was.
the
state
of
louisiana
doesn't
condone
this
type
of
thing.
we
have
constitutional
provisions.
we
have
statutes.
there
are
prison
regulations,
all
of
which
proscribe
this
type
of
thing.
so
that,
yes,
you
would
first
have...
it
would
be
an
opposition
to
all
of
those.
now,
if
you
had
a
single
incident,
as
stated
in
the
court's
question,
and
this
was
by
a
guard,
then
we
would
say,
no,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment...
i
mean,
eighth
amendment
violation
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
that
would
not
constitute
punishment.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
would
have
to
say
if
the
warden
did
it,
that
it
would
give
you
a
different
answer
because
there
you
have
someone
who
sets
policy.
but
here
you
have
two
of
your...
i
would
say...
we
call
them
corrections
securities
officer.
they
are
the
lowest
level
of
the
people
who
handle
prisoners.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
yes,
the
lieutenant,
he
was
on
the
cell
block
with
the
two
corrections
officers,
and
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
camp
was
a
major.
so
it
is
our
suggestion
to
the
court,
and
i
believe
it's
the
proper
one,
that
there
was
not
the
authorization
or
that
there
was
not
anything
done
with
the
sanction
or
as
an
implementation
of
prison
policy.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
let
me
say
that
i--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
am
completely
comfortable
with
that
suggestion,
but
the
difficulty
i
have
with
it
is
that
it
then
introduces
the
question
of
whether
the
statutory
provisions
are
honored
in
the
breach,
and
that
the
true
policy
of
the
state
is
that
which
is
implemented
by
someone
having
authority.
but
in
principle--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--no,
not
a
lieutenant,
because
lieutenant's
are,
if
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so,
a
dime
a
dozen
in
the
prison
hierarchy,
just
as
they
are
in
the
army.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
having
been
one
myself,
i
know--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--let's
say,
not
all
lieutenants
are
equal.
some
lieutenants
are
more
equal
than
other
lieutenants.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
i
was
a
lieutenant,
so
i
know
whereof
i
speak.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
not
in
the
prison;
in
the
army.
there
are
some
who
say
there
isn't
that
much
difference,
but--
[laughter]
--the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
i
was--
but
seriously,
let
me
come
back
if
i
may
to
the
point
i
hope
that
i
have
made
it
clear.
i
may
not
have
convinced
you,
but
i
hope
i
have
made
the
point
clear,
that
this
is
a
separate
argument
on
our
part
that
a
single
incident
of
force
does
not
constitute
punishment,
and
that
therefore,
it
would
not
meet
the
eighth
amendment--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--they
went
off
on
the
significant
injury.
you
are
quite
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
that
was
his
finding,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
we
are
stuck
with
that.
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
but
certainly,
shall
we
say,
insofar
as
this
prisoner
was
concerned,
it
was
a
single
incident.
but
i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
i
say
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
is,
did
this
episode
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
deprivation
by
reason
of
the
significance
of
the
injury?
now,
while
to
you
or
to
me
or
to
anyone
in
our
situation
in
life,
even
a
slight
beating
would
constitute
a
significant
injury,
the
fact
is
that
in
context,
this
was
not
a
significant
injury
and
the
standard
which
this
court
has
enunciated
in
those
cases,
and
in
particular
in
wilson
against
seiter,
is
that
you
must
suffer
objectively
significant
harm.
this,
i
take
from
page
279
and
280
of
the
wilson
v.
seiter
lawyer's
edition
opinion.
again,
at
page
282,
whitley
was
cited
for
the
proposition
that,
assuming
that
the
conduct
is
harmful
enough
to
satisfy
the
objective
component
of
an
eight
amendment
claim.
and
at
page
279,
rhodes
is
cited
for
the
proposition
that
the
objective
component
of
the
eighth
amendment
prison
claim
was,
and
i
quote:
"was
the
deprivation
sufficiently
serious"?
so
that
what
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
your
honors
is
that
the
test
applied
by
the
fifth
circuit,
that
is
to
say,
the
first
element,
is
the
objective
element,
was
there
a
significant
injury,
is
a
proper
one.
it
is
one
which
is
in
keeping
with
the
holdings
of
this
court.
it
is
a
practical
one
which
commends
itself
as
a
means
of
eliminating
frivolous
claims,
and
that,
therefore,
we
would
strongly
recommend
to
your
honors
that
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
and
the
judgment
accordingly.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions--
mr.
harry
mccall,
jr.
--i
thank
you,
your
honor.
