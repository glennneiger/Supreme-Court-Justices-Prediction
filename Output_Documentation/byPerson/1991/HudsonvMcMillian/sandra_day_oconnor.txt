o'connor
do
you
object
just
to
the
first
part
of
the
fifth
circuit's
four-part
test,
the
significant
injury
part?
do
you
think
the
other
factors
are
appropriate
under
whitley?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case
do
you
think
provides
the
proper
standard?
is
it
whitley
or
some
other
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
answer
me,
please,
what
case
do
you
think
provides
the
proper
standard
for
a
case
of
this
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
probably
whitley
provided
the
standard
in
asking
whether
the
force
was
applied
in
a
good-faith
effort
to
maintain
or
restore
discipline,
or
whether
it
was
done
maliciously
or
sadistically
for
the
purpose
of
causing
harm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
that
would
fit,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
would
think
that
we
have
to
apply
the
standard
for
perhaps
failure
to
provide
medical
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
that
context
we
have
said
that
significant
harm
has
to
ensue.
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
that's
the
standard
you
propose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
had
said
that
in
the
estelle
prison
conditions
format
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
prolonged
and
significant
discomfort.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
you
at
least
have
to
have
injury
in
fact
to
have
any
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
may
be
for
constitutional
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
case
do
you
think
provides
the
standard
for
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
like
to
remind
me,
too?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
like
to
remind
me,
too?
i
should,
with
my
apologies
for
not
mentioning
specifically,
justice
o'connor.
the
question
was,
did
the
fifth
circuit
apply
the
correct
legal
test
when
determining
the
petitioner's
claim
that
his
eighth
amendment
rights
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
were
not
violated
as
a
result
of
a
single
incident
of
force
by
the
respondents,
which
did
not
cause
a
significant
injury.
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
to
you,
justice
o'connor
and
gentlemen...
the
justices.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
four-element
test,
and
i
think
the
only
one
with
which
we
are
concerned
with
today
is
the
first
element,
namely
that
is,
that
there
must
be
a
significant
injury.
now,
what
my
friends
appear
to
have
done
is
that
they
seem
to
be
overlooking
that
or
merging
it,
insofar
as
the
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
are
concerned,
with
the
fourth
element...
that
is,
the
nature
of
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
suffering.
let
me
say
this,
it
will
be
recalled
that
in
estelle
v.
gamble,
the
decision
was
that
the
indifference
which
was
at
issue
must
be
to
serious
medical
claims,
not
just
any
medical
claims...
serious
medical
claims.
in
rhodes
it
was
held
that
double-celling
was
not
sufficiently
serious
to
satisfy
the
objective
component
of
the
eighth
amendment
prison
claim.
and
perhaps
it's
appropriate
at
this
point
for
me
to
recall
that
in
wilson
against
seiter,
it
was
made
clear
by
this
court
that
an
eight
amendment
violation
claim
requires
both
an
objective
and
a
subjective
element.
and
in
rhodes,
the
question
which
was
decided
was
that
the
objective
element
was
not
sufficiently
serious.
here
we're
concerned
with
the
objective
element
again.
now,
wilson,
i
think
is
the
one
which
makes
it
clearest
of
all.
in
wilson,
your
honors
cited
your
decision
in
whitley
with
a
proposition,
and
i
quote:
"assuming
the
conduct
is
harmful
enough
to
satisfy
the
objective
component.
"
clearly
what
was
said
there
was
harmful
enough.
it
excluded
conduct
which
was
less
than
harmful
enough,
whether
you
use
the
term
"harmful",
whether
you
use
the
term
"significant",
whether
you
use
the
term
"insignificant",
clearly
what
was
stated
there
was
that
there
was
a
level,
if
you
will,
below
which
you
didn't
have
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
mccall,
what
is
that
level?
i
mean,
i
think
i
can
understand
the
level
that
you
might
call
de
minimis.
you
know,
it's
really
negligible.
i
guess
a
slap
over
the
knuckles
with
a
ruler
or
something
like
that,
but
what
criterion
is
there
that
would
exclude
this
beating,
this
physical
beating...
punching
in
the
face,
in
the
chest,
and
yet
would
include
other
things?
what
is
your
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
you
would
think
that
the
use
of
an
electric
prod
pole
or
some
kind
of
device
like
that
that
didn't
leave
any
physical
remnants
on
the
prisoner
would
be
perfectly
okay.
it
might
hurt
a
lot
but
that's
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
it
would--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you
think
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
having
prison
guards
who
will
simply
take
one
of
the
prisoners
because
he
is
not
obeying
their
orders,
hold
him
down
and
beat
him
up,
just
as
long
as
all
you
have
is
a
few
bruises.
that
is
okay,
as
a
matter
of
prison
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
what
you're
suggesting.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
the
magistrate
even
found
that
this
was
not
a
single
isolated
incident,
but
a
part
of
a
continuing
series
of
events,
and
that
the
supervisor
said,
just
go
right
ahead,
boys,
as
long
as
you
don't
have
too
much
fun.
that
was
the
finding;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
this
case
came
a
lot
closer
to
whitley,
it
being
a
case
where
the
prison
guards
were
trying
to
maintain
discipline
and
so
is
this.
why
doesn't
that
case
provide
the
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whitley
just
applies
if
the
injury
is
more
serious?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
did,
but
i
don't
find
in
the
opinion
an
expression
that
it
could
only
be
applied
when
someone
was
shot.
i
thought
it
dealt
with
the
maintenance
of
prison
discipline.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
any
kind
of
a
finding
below
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
address,
that
this
isn't
a
single
incident
case?
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
just
didn't
get
that...
to
that
question,
but
the
indication
was
at
the
trial
by
the
magistrate--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
keith
hudson,
was
an
inmate
at
the
state
penitentiary
in
angola,
louisiana.
respondents,
jack
mcmillian
and
marvin
woods,
were
corrections
officers
at
that
facility.
in
1983,
mcmillian
and
woods
handcuff
and
shackled
hudson
and
led
him
from
his
cell.
according
to
hudson,
one
of
the
officers
then
punched
him
in
the
mouth,
the
chest,
and
stomach
while
the
other
held
him
in
place
and
kicked
him
from
behind.
hudson
said
that,
a
third
respondent,
the
supervisor
on
duty
at
the
time
watched
the
beating
and
did
not
attempt
to
stop
it.
hudson
suffered
bruises,
swelling
of
his
face
and
mouth,
loosened
teeth
and
a
cracked
dental
plate.
a
magistrate
determined
that
mcmillian
and
woods
used
force
when
there
was
no
need
to
do
so
and
that
the
supervisor
condoned
their
actions,
all
in
violation
of
hudson's
eighth
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
inmates
alleging
use
of
excessive
force
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
cannot
prevail
unless
they
prove
significant
injury.
applying
this
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
hudson's
action
for
damages
on
the
ground
that
his
injuries
were
minor.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
all
eighth
amendment
claims
alleging
excessive
use
of
force
should
be
evaluated
under
the
standard
we
have
previously
applied
to
excessive
force
claims
arising
out
of
efforts
to
put
down
prison
disturbances.
the
guiding
inquiry
is
whether
force
was
applied
in
a
good
faith
effort
to
maintain
or
restore
discipline
or
maliciously
and
sadistically
for
the
purpose
of
causing
harm.
the
extent
of
the
injury
suffered
is
one
factor
that
is
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
force
was
applied
in
a
good
faith
effort
to
maintain
discipline.
although
the
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
excludes
de
minimis
uses
of
physical
force,
we
hold
that
the
extent
of
petitioner's
injuries
in
this
case
provides
no
basis
for
dismissal
of
his
section
1983
claim.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
