chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
be
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
government
runs
the
second
largest
prison
system
in
this
country,
second
only
to
california's.
that
responsibility
has
made
us
keenly
aware
of
the
problem
of
frivolous
brutality
suits
filed
by
inmates...
inmates
who
have
nothing
but
time
on
their
hands
and
for
whom
a
trip
to
the
courthouse
for
a
hearing
would
be
a
pleasant
diversion.
accordingly,
we
would
welcome
any
development
that
holds
promise
of
weeding
out
such
frivolous
suits.
like
every
other
circuit
to
have
considered
the
question,
however,
we
cannot
embrace
the
fifth
circuit's
significant
injury
test.
that
test
is
an
extra-constitutional
construct
with
no
basis
in
the
text
or
history
of
the
eighth
amendment
or
in
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
it.
what
this
court
has
focused
on
is
not
significant
injury,
but
the,
quote:
"unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
"
end
quote.
that
was
the
touchstone
last
term
in
wilson,
a
few
terms
ago
a
whitley--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
do
think
whitley
does,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
action
was
taken
in
response
to
a
prison
disturbance
and
therefore
the
principles
of
whitley
would
apply.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
justification
for
the
force
that
was
applied
is
the
answer
to
the
question
that
whitley
asks
and
can't
be
used
to
prove
the
inapplicability
of
the
whitley
standard.
the
court
below
acknowledged
that
this
court's
standard
was
satisfied
in
this
case.
in
the
words
of
the
fifth
circuit,
"the
conduct
of
mcmillian
and
woods
was
clearly
excessive
and
occasioned
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
"
end
quote.
it
threw
it
out
because
in
the
court's
view,
hudson
had
not
sustained
significant
injury.
but
the
respondents
have
not
and
cannot
today
cite
a
single
decision
from
this
court
indicating
that
significant
injury
is
a
threshold...
requirement
on
top
of
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
we
think
that
most
beatings
that
give
rise
to
a
valid
eighth
amendment
claim
would
also
give
rise
to
significant
injury,
but
it
is
not
a
threshold
requirement
that
the
framers
forgot
to
mention
and
this
court
has
never
had
occasion
to
mention.
it
is
simply
one
factor
to
consider
in
deciding
if
there
has
been
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
the
fifth
circuit's
test
will,
we
think,
weed
out
frivolous
claims,
but
at
too
high
a
price.
it
will,
for
example,
weed
out
meritorious
claims
like
the
one
before
the
court
today.
my
brother
quite
properly
focused
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
come
to
this
court
undisputed.
the
petitioner,
while
cuffed
and
shackled,
was
punched
in
the
eyes,
the
mouth,
the
chest,
the
stomach,
kicked
from
behind.
he
sustained
bruises,
swelling,
a
split
lip--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--my
answer
is
in
two
parts,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
we
can
categorically
exclude
such
claims.
it
is
easy
to
imagine
cases
of
mental
torture
that
would
qualify
under
the
eighth
amendment:
a
prison
guard
pretending
to
partially
load
a
revolver
and
then
playing
russian
roulette
with
the
inmate.
i
think
that
would
be
the
infliction
of
pain,
unnecessarily
and
wantonly.
i
do
think
though
when
there
is
a
claim
of
pain
which
isn't
substantiated,
if
you
will,
by
more
concrete
evidence,
that
a
court
can
be
properly
skeptical
of
the
claim.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that
that
is
relevant
when
the
question--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
there's
a...
it's
a
different
question,
whether
the
state
can
be
held
liable
under
st.
louis
v.
praprotnik.
there
you
do
need
to
establish
that
the
harm
was
pursuant
to
a
state
policy.
but
here,
this
fits
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
of
punishment
or
judge
posner's
definition
that
was
cited
by
your
honor--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
have
to
show
a
state
action,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
that
that
is
present
in
this
case.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
state
of
louisiana
passed
a
statute
saying
you
may
beat
the...
prisoner
before
the
prisoner--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
is
punishment
under
the
ordinary
definition
of
the
term.
it
was
a
consequence
of
the
prisoner's
failure
to
follow
the
guard's
orders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
this
case
it
is
because
it
is
punishment
under
the
definition
and
a
response
by
a
state
actor
to
a
perceived
violation
of
prison
rules,
a
consequence.
they
said
knock
it
off
or
else,
and
the
or
else
was
the
punishment.
now,
we
don't
think
that
every
time
a
guard
beats
a
prisoner
it
is
necessarily
punishment.
we
can
imagine
cases
where
it
is
not.
for
example,
a
guard
has
difficulties
at
home
and
comes
in
in
a
rage
and
says,
i
am
going
to
beat
the
first
three
people
i
see,
and
beats
two
guards
and
an
inmate.
that's
not
punishment
of
the
inmate
because
it
doesn't
fit
the
dictionary
definition.
the
inmate
is
not
being...
in
judge
posner's
words
that
you
quoted
in
wilson,
it
is
not
a
deliberate
act
intended
to
chastise
or
deter.
the
inmate
in
that
case
would
have
an
assault
remedy
against
the
guard.
but
in
this
case--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
under
bell
v.
wolfish,
he
would
have
sustained
punishment
without
any
other
legitimate
state
purpose
and
that
would
have
violated
substantive
due
process
in
the
case
of
a
pre-trial
detainee.
another
example
that
may
not
be
punishment,
justice
scalia,
is
a
purely
personal
dispute,
sort
of
two
people
who
have
been
feuding
since
childhood,
a
hatfield
and
a
mccoy
and
the
one
becomes
a
guard
and
all
of
a
sudden
one
is
an
inmate
and
the
guard
immediately
assaults
him,
as
he
would
if
he
ran
into
him
on
the
street.
we
think
in
that
case
it
may
not
properly
be
characterized
as
punishment.
but
the
key
fact
here
is
that
the
guard
was
exercising
state
authority
to
enforce
prison
rules
established
by
the
state,
and
in
that
situation
it
clearly
qualifies
as
punishment.
in
addition,
of
course,
they
did
call
upon
lieutenant
mezo--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it
does
not.
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
the
eighth
amendment
was
not
applicable
because
the
court
has
held
it
applies
only
after
conviction
and
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
eighth
amendment
doesn't
impose
such
a
limitation.
it
says
that
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
will
not
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
court
has
decided
in
bell...
ingraham
and
other
cases
that
the
eighth
amendment
protections
are
triggered
only
with
conviction
and
punishment.
that
was
the
intent
of
the
framers
in
establishing
it.
having
gotten
over
that
hurdle,
the
question
simply
then
is,
and
a
threshold,
is
this
punishment?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
guard
is
discharging
his
duties
in
enforcing
the
prison
rules...
it's
punishment
in
the
normal
sense.
if
you
don't
stop
making
a
disturbance,
i
will
punish
you.
he
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
court
hasn't
limited
it
such
in
the
past.
for
example,
in
estelle
v.
gamble
or
something,
the
prisoners
were
not
denied
medical
care
because
they
had
been
sentenced
for
particular
crimes.
it
was
a
condition
of
confinement.
the
point
is
that
in
deciding...
once
it
is
determined
that
it
is
punishment,
the
relative
question
is
not
whether
there
has
been
an
actual
physical
injury,
but
whether
the
inmate
has
sustained
pain,
and
in
this
case,
we
think
he
has.
thank
you,
your
honor.
