m.

well,
do
you
read
any
of
our
cases
as
saying
that
a
complaint
is
frivolous
if
it
has
a
legally
sustainable
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
most
of
the
cases
under
39.8
are
cases
that
are
just
not
sustainable
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
what
precedential
value
you
can
get
from
those
cases.
we
haven't
stated
any
standard
to
the
contrary
of
what
the
respondent
argues
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
the
realm
of
discretion
and
subjectivity
you're
arguing.
i
take
it
you
mean
that
what
might
pass
one
district
judge
wouldn't
pass
another
so
far
as
this
rule
is
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
feel
badly
about
this,
mr.
nichols.
you
can
stick
with
it
if
you
like.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
say
that
then
don't
you
run
contrary
to
what
we
said
in
neitzke?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
say
that
isn't
that
contrary
to
our
case
in
neitzke
where
we
said
there
is
a
difference?
