justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask,
was
this
dismissal
here
with
prejudice
or
without
prejudice?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
that
all
we're,
so
you
think
that
he
could
have
rebrought
any
one
of
these
complaints
if
he
could
pony
up
the
money
for
the
filing
fee
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
that
makes
a
big
difference
as
to
what
our
standard
is
going
to
be.
if
all
we're
doing
is
excluding
somebody
from
the
ifp,
it
seems
to
me
it's
one
thing,
but
if
you
think
the
dismissal
means
he
can't
rebring
it,
then
maybe
we
ought
to
have
a
higher
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
does
not
qualify
for
that
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
what...
your
bottom
line
is
i
can
dismiss
it
as
a
district
judge?
a
guy
comes
in
and
says
i
have
been
raped
by
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
all
he
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
to
let
him
amend?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
i
have
to
let
him
amend?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he,
what
if
the
court
does
all
of
that
and
after
doing
that
99
of
the
allegations
are
clearly
frivolous,
they
are
of
the
robin
hood
category,
and
there
is
one
that,
yeah,
it
could
have
happened,
most
unlikely
in
the
company
of
these
99
other
absolutely
mad
allegations.
the
court
has
to
let
that
one
go
forward,
you
think,
and
couldn't
say
this
is
a
ridiculous,
frivolous
suit,
out
of
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
that?
it
seems
to
me...
do
you
know
any
other
provision
that
is
phrased
this
way?
it
doesn't
say
it
may
dismiss
if
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
it
says
it
may
dismiss
if
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious.
i
think
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
you
think
that
has
a
flavor
of,
look,
use
your
common
sense,
district
judge.
this
is
something
that
doesn't
have
to
be
accorded,
the
ability
to
bring
suit
without
paying
the
filing
fees.
if
you're
satisfied
that
it's
a
frivolous
suit,
dismiss
it
without
prejudice,
and
if
he
wants
to
pay
money
to
make
these
frivolous
claims
he
can
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
dealing
with
a
mentally
disturbed
person,
and
that
there
was
not
much
reason
to
believe
that
any
of
these
complaints
was
valid.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
a
very
reasonable
determination
by
the
district
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
denial
of
access
to
the
courts.
it's
a
denial
of
the
special
privilege
of
being
able
to
come
to
court
without
paying
the
money.
right?
you
can
always
still
file
it
if
you
can
pay
the
filing
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
somebody
came
in
with
a
paid
complaint
alleging
some
cause
of
action
that
depended
upon
that,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it's
not
an
absolute
impossibility
test.
it's
just
what
seems
to
you
to
be
likely
or
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
irrational
if
you
allow
the
possibility
that
there
exist
creatures
on
mars?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
irrational
if
you
entertain
that
possibility?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
entertain
the
possibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness.
i'm
glad
you
weren't
on
board
with
columbus.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
glad
you
were
not
on
board
with
columbus.
i
mean,
you
know,
they
would
have
said
the
same
thing
about
the
round
earth,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
standard
of
review?
do
you
have
a
position
on
that?
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
de
novo
entirely
or
abuse
of
discretion?
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
says
if
satisfied,
the
court
may
do
it
if
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
the
case,
but
that's
always
the
case
when
you
apply
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
if
there
is
discretion
it
means
things
can
be
done
differently
in
different
districts.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
no
explanation
for
the
words
if
satisfied
that
then.
it
may
as
well
have
read,
as
far
as
your
case
is
concerned,
if
the
action
is
frivolous
or
malicious,
which
is
not
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
point
is
if
a
martian
is,
can
be
determined
delusional,
it's
not
too
much
of
a
jump
to
say
that
these
allegations
of
repeated
rapes
while
he
was
asleep
without
his
awaking
are
pretty
close
to
the
same
category?
