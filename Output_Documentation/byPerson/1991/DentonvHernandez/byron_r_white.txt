justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
it--
--was
this
a
dismissal
under
12(b)(6)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
just
misspeak
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
1915?
what
did
they
say
about
1915?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
is
challenging
that
standard
for
dismissing
under
1915.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
they
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
on
1915.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do.
well,
are
you
going
to
argue
about
that?
are
you
going
to
get
to
that
sometime?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
ninth
circuit
disposed
of
the
1915
issue
on
the
requirement
of
judicial
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
remand
wasn't
in
connection
with
1915,
it
was
the
12(b)(6).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
were
they
going
to
remand?
oh,
i
mean
the
remand
for
giving
him
a
chance
to
amend
was
on
12(b)(6).
justice
byron
r.
white
under--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
standard,
and
i
suppose
we
could,
if
we
don't
agree
with
it
either
i
suppose
we
could
just
remand
and
say
make
up
another
one,
or
we
could
say
here's
what
the
right
standard
is.
and
we
could
say
and
by
the
way,
the
respondent
proposed
a
standard
that
we
think
isn't
too
bad,
so
we're
going
to
remand
and
have
you
decide
the
case
under
that
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
we
should
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
us
apply
your
standard
up
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
or,
if
we
don't
agree
with
your
standard,
whatever
standard
we
come
up
with
should
go
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
seems
to
think
that
the
lower
courts
are
at
sea
after
neitzke.
they
don't,
they're
all
over
the
lot.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
nichols.
mr.
ching,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
16
minutes
remaining.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
didn't
mean
judicial
notice
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
say
the
complaint
nevertheless
should
have
been
dismissed
in
its
entirety?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
haven't,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
white
the
opinion
and
judgment
in
denton
against
hernandez
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
