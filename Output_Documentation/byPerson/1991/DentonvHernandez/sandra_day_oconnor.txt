justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ching,
do
you
take
the
view
that
the
trial
judge
is
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
allegations
made
in
a
complaint,
the
factual
allegations
made,
or
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
trial
court
should
just
determine
what
rational
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
facts
that
are
alleged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in...
looking
at
the
complaints
here
that
perhaps
it
could
be
said
that
no
rational
inference
of
rapes
could
be
made
from
the
facts
that
were
alleged
with
the
exception,
of
course,
of
the
affidavits
submitted
by
armando
esquer.
what
do
you
do
about
that,
where
he
says
he
witnessed
sexual
assaults
on
the
complaining
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
to
that
do
you
think
in
the
face
of
the
affidavit
of
armando
esquer,
that
as
to
that
complaint
which
is
one
of
the
five,
that
it
can
be
dismissed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
but
when
you
look
at
the
affidavit
of
this
third
party,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
saying
that
the
trial
judge
should
just
make
a
credibility
determination
as
to
that
affidavit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
nichols,
some
of
the
allegations
here
may
fall
in
that
category,
i
would
suggest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
may
fail
to
allow
a
rational
inference
to
be
drawn
as
to
some
of
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
hernandez,
a
prisoner
proceeding
pro
se,
filed
five
civil
rights
suits
in
forma
pauperis
against
the
petitioner,
the
california
prison
officials,
alleging,
among
other
things,
that
he
was
drugged
and
homosexually
raped
while
he
slept
a
total
of
28
times
by
various
inmates
and
prison
officials
at
different
institutions.
finding
that
the
facts
alleged
appeared
to
be
wholly
fanciful,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
cases
pursuant
to
28
united
states
code
section
1915(d)
which
allows
federal
courts
to
dismiss
an
in
forma
pauperis
complaint
if
satisfied
that
the
action
is
frivolous.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded.
the
lead
opinion
concluded
that
a
court
can
dismiss
a
complaint
as
factually
frivolous
only
if
the
allegations
conflict
with
judicial
and
noticeable
facts,
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
take
judicial
notice
that
none
of
the
alleged
rapes
occurred.
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
position
when
this
court
remanded
the
case
for
consideration
of
our
intervening
decision
in
neitzke
versus
williams
which
held
that
an
in
forma
pauperis
complaint
is
frivolous
under
section
1915(d)
where
it
lacks
an
arguable
basis
either
in
law
or
in
fact.
we
hold,
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
that
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
limited
the
power
granted
the
court
to
dismiss
a
frivolous
case
under
the
federal
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
in
neitzke,
we
held
that
section
1915(d)
gives
the
courts
the
unusual
power
to
pierce
the
vale
of
the
complaint's
factual
allegations
and
dismiss
those
claims
whose
factual
contentions
are
clearly
baseless.
thus,
the
court
is
not
bound
to
accept
without
question
the
truth
of
the
plaintiff's
allegations.
although
a
complaint
cannot
be
dismissed
simply
because
the
court
finds
the
allegations
to
be
improbable
or
unlikely,
a
finding
of
factual
frivolousness
is
appropriate
when
the
facts
alleged
rise
to
the
level
of
the
irrational
or
the
wholly
incredible.
because
the
frivolousness
determination
is
a
discretionary
one,
we
also
hold
that
it
was
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
district
court's
dismissal
de
novo
rather
than
for
abuse
of
discretion.
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
application
of
the
proper
standard.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
blackmun.
