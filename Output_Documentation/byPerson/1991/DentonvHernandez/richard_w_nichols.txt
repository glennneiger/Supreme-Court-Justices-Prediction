mr.
richard
w.
nichols
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1915
is
a
statute
of
general
applicability
to
poor
persons.
it
is
a
statute
enacted
in
support
of
a
congressional
goal
that
access
to
the
courts
should
be
equally
available
to
the
poor
as
well
as
to
the
rich.
it
is
not
a
statute
which
applies
only
to
prisoner
or
civil
rights
cases
such
as
this
case
is,
and,
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
it
is
not
a
sanction
statement,
statute.
in
balancing
the
right
of
access
under
section
1915
against
caseload
concerns
that
district
courts
obviously
have
that
moved
congress
to
authorize
dismissals
for
frivolousness
under
the
statute,
it
is
desirable
that
district
courts
be
afforded
an
objective
standard...
this
is
one
of
the
substantial
differences
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
in
this
case...
an
objective
standard
pursuant
to
which
they
can
determine
whether
particular
factual
allegations
have
an
arguable
basis
and
therefore
are
not
frivolous.
this
court
has
already
partially
determined
an
objective
standard
in
neitzke,
namely
the
standard
that
the
claim
must
have
a,
quote,
arguable
basis,
unquote,
in
law
and
fact.
arguable
does
not
mean
reasonable
chance
of
succeeding
according
to
the
viewer.
arguable
in
the
view
of
the
respondent
means
whether
any
rational
fact-finder
could
conclude
that
the
allegations
are
true.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
certainly
that
is
the
sense
in
which
it
is
most
frequently
used,
but
the
court's
definition
of
the
standard
in
neitzke
applied
the
same
definition,
arguable
basis,
to
both
law
and
fact.
and
it
seems
to
the
respondent
that
in
trying
to
figure
out
what
an
arguable
basis
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
rational
fact-finder
would
be
the
one
to
determine
whether
a
particular
factual
argument
is
or
is
not
arguable.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
it's
essentially,
essentially
akin
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
procedure,
although
not
necessarily
having
to
be
brought
by
motion.
the
neitzke
case
clearly
establishes
that
motions
to
dismiss
and
frivolousness
dismissals
are
different
in
kind.
and
if
i
may
respond
to
justice
scalia's
earlier
question,
it
is
the
respondent's
view,
it
is
my
view
that
a
frivolousness
dismissal
constitutes
a
factual
determination
of
frivolousness
which
would
preclude
the
bringing
of
a
second
action
on
the
same
claims
if
the
plaintiff
could
get
together
the
money
to
pay
the
filing
fee.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
absolutely,
and--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--well,
the
district
court
can
require
a
number
of,
impose
a
number
of
procedural
requirements
to
require
the
plaintiff
to
get
away
from
pleading
conclusions
and
plead
evidentiary
material,
heightened
facts,
so
that
the
district
court
can
determine,
prior
to
the
plaintiff
coming
in
for
an
evidentiary
credibility
determination,
whether
the
pleadings
with
those
items
of
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
enable
a
rational
fact-finder
to
conclude
that
there
was
something
worth
proceeding
on
to
the
credibility
point.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
it
certainly
contemplates
dismissals
without
leave
to
amend.
i
suppose
that
there
are
some
types
of
allegations
that
are
so
outlandish
on
their
face
that
no
rational
fact-finder
could
ever
conclude,
no
matter
how
much
opportunity
to
amend
was
granted,
that
they
would,
that
they
could
survive.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
well,
some
of
them...
i
will
certainly
admit,
justice
o'connor,
that
quite
a
number
of
them
fail
to
survive
a
12(b)(6)
test
at
this
point,
and
it
may
be
on
amendment--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--well,
mr.
hernandez
has
never
been
given
an
opportunity
to
amend
in
respond,
in
response
to
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
what
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do.
we
don't
know
what
he
might
try
to
do
by
way
of
amendment.
if
i
may
give
you
an
example,
let's
assume
a
prisoner
says
i
was
raped
by
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men.
clearly
an
irrational
allegation
on
its
face.
however,
if
you
superimpose
on
that
the
possibility
of
a
prisoner
alleging
that
there
had
been
a
prison
show
about
robin
hood
and
some
of
the
other
inmates
had
kept
some
of
the
clothing
and
the
other
inmates
in
that
clothing
had
come
in,
maybe
it's
not
quite
so
irrational.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
and
the
notice
point,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
kind
of
a
due
process
thing
that
if
you're
going
to
throw
a
plaintiff
out
with
prejudice
he
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
plead
his
best
case.
and
when
we're
talking
about
pro
se
plaintiffs
we
can
almost
presume
that
they
haven't
pled
their
best
case
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
your
honor,
what
i
had
in
mind
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
was
mr.
hernandez
has
brought
in
the
director
of
the
prison
system,
he
has
brought
in
the
warden,
and
he
has
not
pled
anything
remotely
close
to
personal
responsibility
on
the
part
of
those
people.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
will
go
a
little
farther
than
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
some
of
the
rape
claims
say
i
suspect.
i
don't
know
who
did
it,
but
guard
perdoni
was
on
the
shift
at
the
time
it
happened.
i
would
be
perfectly
prepared
to
concede
that
that
does
not
constitute
a
sufficient
allegation
against
the
unknown
guard
or
the
speculative
guard
to
survive
a
12(b)(6)
motion
in
terms
of
an
allegation
of
personal
responsibility
for
a
specific
act.
but
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
has
been
to
say
a
lot
of
these
allegations
probably
don't
survive
a
12(b)(6),
but
it
is
the
rule
of
our
circuit
that,
as
mr.
ching
has
referred
to
it,
the
notice
rule,
that
before
the
ninth
circuit
will
dismiss
a
case
under
12(b)(6)
with
prejudice
it
requires
that
a
pro
se
plaintiff
be
given
notice
of
the
deficiency
and
an
opportunity
to
amend.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
no,
it
was
not.
this
was
a
dismissal
under
1915.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
no.
what
i
said,
what
i
intended
to
say,
justice
white,
was
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
reversing
the
1915
dismissal
pointed
out
that
many
of
these
allegations
as
they
stood
would
not
survive
a
12(b)(6),
but
that
the
district
court
ought
to
give
the
plaintiff,
mr.
hernandez,
an
opportunity
to
replead
in
light
of
its
discussion
of
those
legal
deficiencies
so
that
he
could
attempt
to
avoid
those
12(b)(6)
deficiencies.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
they
said
that
1915
required
them
to
be
able
to
take
judicial
notice
that
no
rapes
occurred,
and
they
could
not
do
that.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
the
state,
as
i
understand
it,
is
contending
that
the
district
court
has
absolute
and
standardless
discretion
to
dismiss
under
1915.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
certainly.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
yes,
justice
white.
it
is
my
view
that
a
1915
dismissal
cannot
be
justified
unless
the
court
can
make
a
determination
that
no
rational
fact-finder
could
ultimately
conclude
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
worthy
of
belief.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
in
my
view
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
without
any
other
facts
does
not,
would
be
dismissible
under
1915.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
would.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
yes.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--if
you
superimpose
additional
facts
on
top
of
that,
then
maybe
you
can
start
dealing
with
a
mentally
ill
prisoner
who
perceives
matters
perhaps
a
little
differently
than
you
and
i
might
perceive
them,
articulates
them
a
little
differently--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--if
that
is
all
he
says--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--that's
all
he
says--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--that's
my
bottom
line.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
am
sorry.
if
i
can
back
up
for
a
moment,
justice
scalia.
if
that's
all
he
says
and
he
doesn't
attempt
to
amend.
if
he
attempts
to...
he
ought
to
be
given
notice,
in
my
view,
that
it
is
the
court's
intent
to
dismiss
under
1915
unless
he
amends
to
set
forth
some
additional
facts
that
carry
with
them
an
indicia
of
rationality.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
believe
the
remand
was
on
both
issues.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
they
were
going
to
give
him
a
chance
to
amend
to
cure
the
12(b)(6)
deficiencies
and
to--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--and
to
amend
to
cure
what
appeared
to
be
irrational
allegations
as
they
stood.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
under
1915.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
mr.
chief
justice,
the
posture
that
we
take
is
that
a
district
judge
can
do
all
of
those
things
prior
to
service
and
prior
to
requiring
that
an
answer
or
responsive
pleading
be
filed
by
a
defendant.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
well,
it
seems
to
us,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
district
court
is
required
to
take
a
look
at
each
of
the
allegations.
for
example
in
this
case
there
are
some
allegations
that
respectfully
are
not
irrational
in
my
view
under
anybody's
test.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
believe
that
the
district
court
may
not
do
so
unless
and
until
a
plaintiff
has
been
given
a
knowing
opportunity
to
present
his
best
evidentiary
case
to
the
court.
and
if
he
can't
pass
muster
at
that
time
then
the
district
court
can
dismiss
without
having
to
have
process
served.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
that
is
our
view,
justice
scalia.
the
court
does
have
to
let
that
one
go
forward.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
know
of
no
other
statute
that
has
that--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--well,
there
is
two
questions
there
as
i
see
it,
justice
scalia.
number
one
is
that
this
is
not
a
refusal
in
the
first
instance
by
the
district
court
to
permit
this
complaint
to
be
filed
under
section
19(a).
the
district
court
did
permit
these
complaints
to
be
filed
and
specifically
found
that
it
could
not
find
on
the
face
of
each
separate
complaint
that
it
was
frivolous.
and
the
1915(d)
dismissal
order
was
entered
only
after
the
district
court
looked
at
all
of
these
case,
related
them
all
together
and
dismissed
them
on
the
basis
of
one
is
not
incredible
but
28
is,
in
effect.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
it
is
our
view,
justice
scalia,
that
that
type
of
a
rationale
puts
you
on
the
slippery
slope
of
essentially
denying
to
mentally
ill
persons
as
a
class
the
right
of
access
to
the
court
because
any
mentally
ill
person
is
going
to
be
to
some
degree
unable
to
state
a
claim
that
would
not
be
subject
to
that
type
of
criticism.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
but
that
privilege
was
granted
here.
this
is
a
second
step
after
that
privilege
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
well,
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made,
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
proper
argument,
but
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
that
in
section
1915(a)
the
use
of
the
word
may,
the
district
court
may
authorize
the
filing
without
prepayment
of
fees,
constitutes
an
empowerment
to
the
district
court
to
refuse
to
authorize
such
a
filing
even
if
the
affidavit
of
poverty
conclusively
establishes
poverty
eligibility.
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
are
dealing
with
here,
however,
because
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
grant
leave.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
it
is
not
100
percent
the
same,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
well,
where
i
perceive
my
difference
from
the
ninth
circuit,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
a
judicial
notice
concept
that
the
facts
alleged
were
not
subject
to
reasonable
dispute.
now
that
to
me
is
an
evidentiary
test,
and
the
test
that
i
am
arguing
to
this
court
is
a
test
that
is
measured
at
the
stage
of
the
fact-finder
or
the
ultimate
determiner
of
the
action,
not
an
evidentiary
test.
and
in
that
sense
it
is
a
test
that
is
closer,
i
believe,
to
the
summary
judgment
test
that
the
court
has
articulated
in
matsushita
and
celotex.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
they...
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
imposes
a
notice
requirement
in
1915
at
all.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
what
the
ninth
circuit
does
do
is
to
require
that
all
of
the
alleged
facts
be
considered
to
be
true
unless
judicial
notice
to
the
contrary
can
be
taken.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
right.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
well,
i
think
that's--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i
think
that's
what
judges
sort
out,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
no.
not
what
seems
to
the
individual
district
judge.
what
any
rational
fact-finder
could
determine.
i
go
back
here
and
i
rest
very
strongly
on
the
test
in
the
summary
judgment
cases,
that
the
rational
fact-finder
is
the
test,
and
that's
not--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
in
this
society
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
there
is
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
well--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i
suppose
that
columbus
was
putting
up
some
of
his
own
money
in
connection
with
the
ships
that
he
sailed
west
on
and
not
asking
entirely
for
the
crown's
fisc
on
it.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
that...
i
think
that
is
essentially
right.
where
there
is
a
difference
is--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i
am
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
neitzke
dealt
with
the
distinctions
between
1915(d)
and
12(b)(6),
not
distinctions
between
1915(d)
and
summary
judgement.
12(b)(6)
you
have
to
accept
as
true
the
facts
that
are
alleged.
summary
judgment
you
can
probe
those
facts
to
the
degree
that
if
you
conclude
that
no
rational
fact-finder
could
support
a
conclusion
you
can
grant
summary
judgment,
even
though
there
is
a
scintilla
of
evidence
to
the
contrary.
and
that
is
the,
that
is
the
test
that
i
am
proposing.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
yes,
justice
scalia.
the
standard--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i
would
propose
a
de
novo
standard
or
review
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
judging
the
viability
or
nonviability
of
written
documents.
it's
not
like
a
rule
11
situation
where
you
are
inquiring
into
the
reasonableness
of
an
investigation
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
it
seems
to
me
that
the
if
satisfied
test
of
absolute
standardless
discretion
would
do
precisely
what
mr.
ching
conceded
to
justice
o'connor
would
happen,
namely
allow
a
district
judge
in
michigan
to
handle
exactly
the
same
allegations
as
a
district
judge
in
texas
in
completely
opposite
ways.
and--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--well--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
do
not
have
an
explanation.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
it--
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
--i'd
take
it
a
step
further,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
would
not
have
you
apply
my
standard
up
here.
i
would
have
you
remand
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
with
directions
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
to
apply
that
standard.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
whatever
standard
you
come
up
with
ought
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
and
it
ought
to
be
a
standard
that
is
applied
to
each
specific
factual
claim
and
not
just
simply
to
the
complaints
as
a
whole.
mr.
richard
w.
nichols
i
don't
know
that
i
would
argue
with
that.
