90-1846,
george
f.
denton,
director
of
corrections
of
california
v.
mike
hernandez.
mr.
ching.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
didn't
hear
oral
argument--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
just
held
the
case
for
neitzke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
explain
in
a
little
more
detail
what
is
the
exclusive
judicial
notice
rule
that
you're
referring
to,
mr.
ching?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
standard
for
frivolity
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
may
be
quite
different
when
applied
on
facts
from
the
standard
of
frivolity
applied
to
a
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rule
11
is
really
premised
on
the
idea
of
sanctions,
frequently
monetary
sanctions--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--imposed
against
counsel,
perhaps,
and
in
some
cases
perhaps
clients,
and
the
fact
that
one
is
seeking
to
proceed
ifp
pretty
well
negates
the
idea
that
sanctions
of
that
sort
are
going
to
be
used.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ching.
mr.
nichols,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
arguable
almost,
you
think
of
it
as
an
adjective
used
to
modify
something
dealing
with
law
rather
than
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
inserting
a
whole
layer
of
some
sort
of
determination
different
from
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
neitzke
certainly
allows
the
district
court
or
the
magistrate,
whoever
is
the
initial
determiner,
to
probe
beyond
the
surface
allegations.
you
don't
have
to
treat
it
the
way
you
do
a
dismiss,
where
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
all
properly
pleaded
facts
are
treated
as
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
more
can
the
district
court
do,
in
your
view,
than
it
can
do
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
is
virtually
nothing
so
far
as
well
pleaded
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
rule,
the
section
as
written
contemplates
some
dismissals
without
further
leave
to
amend
or
anything
else,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
nichols,
in
your
response
to
justice
o'connor
you
said
that
some
of
the
allegations
here
would
not
survive
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
as
if
you
were,
that
were
a
more
extreme
test
than
1915.
i
had
thought
that
just
the
opposite
was
true,
that
some
allegations
of
fact
that
would
survive
a
12(b)(6)
test
could
be
thrown
out
on
the
grounds
of
fantasy
or
delusion
in
a
way
that
we
have
never
said
a
12(b)(6)
motion
would
reach
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
you
were
not
then
addressing
the
28
rape
claims,
assuming
responsible--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
one
reads
1915(d)
in
connection
with
rule
56
for
summary
judgment
in
a
civil
case,
rule
12(b)(6),
motion
to
dismiss,
it
is
supposed
to
open
the
possibility,
one
would
think,
and
i
think
neitzke
supports
this,
of
a
judge,
before
the
complaint
is
served
or
answered,
at
a
very,
very
early
stage,
to
dismiss
a
certain
small
class
of
cases
even
though
they
might
state,
if
the
facts
were
believed,
they
might
state
a
legal
claim.
now,
if
one
tacks
on
the
notice
requirement
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
talking
about,
the
leave
to
amend,
it
loses
all
its
usefulness.
a
judge
is
far,
a
trial
judge
is
far
better
off
saying
i'll
never
use
1915,
we'll
just
get
the
state
to
respond,
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
decide
it
that
way.
it
seems
to
me,
with
all
the
baggage
that
you
say
1915
carries
with
it,
it
is
virtually
useless.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
will
have
taken
up
a
considerable
amount
of
its
time
in
doing
those
things.
it
would
have
perhaps
taken
less
time
to
simply
say
let
the
state
answer,
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we'll
have
that
argued,
i'll
decide
it
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
doubts
the
district
court
must
take
a
look
at
each
of
the
allegations,
but
the
question
is
may
the
district
court
dismiss
some
allegations
as
frivolous
without
any
ifs,
ands,
or
buts
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
district
court
have
any
discretion
under
1915(a)
if
the
affidavit
is
filed?
i
don't
read
that
section
as
requiring
any
determination
of
merit
or
likely
merit
by
the
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
spain
didn't
have
a
section
1915(d).
mr.
nichols,
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
come
back
to,
though,
is
that
you
say
this
is
the
same
as
a
summary
judgment
standard.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
discern
any
difference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
they
put
a
martian
on
the
stand
the
jury
might
believe
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
just
because
the
fellow
is
psychotic
doesn't
mean
he's
not
going
to
be
raped.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ching.
the
case
is
submitted.
