justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
nichols?
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
the
same
as
the
theory
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
be
sure
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
specifically
in
the
case
of
an
allegation
that
one
would
call
fantastic
or
delusional
scenarios,
men
from
mars,
little
green
men
doing
things
to
someone.
they
wouldn't
require
notice
to
dismiss
that
kind
of
a
complaint,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
a
little...
i'm
not
sure
we're
on
the
same
wave
length
here,
that's
what's
bothering
me.
in
order
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
one
would
not
have
to
hold
that
in
the
category
of
fantastic
or
delusional
scenarios,
they
treat
those
separately,
that
notice
is
required.
you
may
argue
that
notice
is
desirable
in
those
cases,
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
hold
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
they
said,
that
this
is
a
case
which
seems
highly
improbable
but
there
is
enough
corroboration...
justice
o'connor
mentioned
the
affidavit
and
some
of
these
things...
that
they
alleged
28
rapes,
well,
maybe
one
occurred,
who
knows,
that
you
can't,
you
don't
put
it
in
the
fantastic
or
delusional
category,
but
in
the
factual
category.
then
they
say
there
is
notice
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
judicial
notice,
for
example,
would
be
if
they
were
men
from
mars,
we
would
take
judicial
notice
that
that's
fantastic
and
we
can
dismiss
without
looking
any
farther.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you've
got
something
that
on
its
face
is
not
totally
improbable
you
don't
dismiss
on
its
face--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--without
requiring
a
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nichols,
your
test
is
what?
it's
an
absolute...
isn't
it
all
relative?
the
men
from
mars?
i
mean,
robin
hood
is
dead,
i
suppose,
but
men
from
mars?
there
may
be
men
from
mars,
you
know.
do
we
really
know
that
there
aren't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
ching,
what
your
understanding
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule
is?
is
it
not
true
that
they
think
there's
a
category
of
cases
called
fantastic
or
delusional
that
the
district
judge
can
just
dismiss
out
of
hand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
if
they,
in
other
words
if
they
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
even
though
it's
possible,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
the
probability
that
there
are
men
from
mars
in
this
particular
prison
is
sufficiently
remote
that
the
judge
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
improbability
and
therefore
go
ahead
and
dismiss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
negate
the
allegations
of
the
complaint?
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
suppose
we
meant
when
we
referred...
that
comes
out
of
neitzke,
i
think,
the
fantastic
or
delusional
scenarios.
do
you
think,
what
do
you
think
we
meant
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
it,
maybe
i
miss
it
in
the
ninth
circuit,
what
is
it
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
tells
us
that
even
in
the
kind,
the
martian
type
delusional
case
they
are
not
going
to
dismiss?
i
don't
understand
the
judicial
notice
argument
in
that
particular
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
what
they
said
was
that
there
are
allegations
here
that
have
some
factual
support,
and
there
is
enough
factual
support
that
we'll
send
them
back
and
have
the
district
judge
take
a
look
at
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
use
that
term,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
what
do
you
do
about
the
affidavit
of
the
eye
witness?
