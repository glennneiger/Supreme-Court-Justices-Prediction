mr.
james
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
before
the
court
for
a
second
time.
the
initial
decision,
hernandez
i,
announced
an
exclusive
judicial
notice
rule
for
determination
of
frivolity
under
section
1915(d).
this
court
summarily
remanded,
granted
the
petition,
remanded
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
determination
according
to
the
then-recent
case
of
neitzke.
mr.
james
ching
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
you
remanded
it
for
review
in
light
of
neitzke.
hernandez
ii,
the
product
of
that
remand,
once
again
announces
an
exclusive
judicial
notice
rule.
this
rule
is
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
neitzke
and
is
contrary
to
the
logic
of,
the
interpretation
of
1915
in
the
line
of
cases
this
court
has
announced
beginning
with
mcdonald
and
sindram,
passing
through
the
announcement
of
rule
38.9
and
the
recent
case
of
zatko.
the...
it
is
my
contention
initially
there
is
no
justification
for
an
exclusive
judicial
notice
rule.
the
ninth
circuit
has
fashioned
this
requirement
out
of
thin
air.
it
has
no
basis
in
law
and
is
contrary
to
policy.
mr.
james
ching
yes,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
required
that
before
a
case
could
be
determined
as
frivolous
and
in
forma
pauperis
status
rejected,
reference
had
to
be
made
through
judicial
notice
to
some
objective
negating
fact
which
positively
contramanded
the
allegations
of
the
pleading.
this
approach
is
contrary
to
that
in
neitzke,
in
which
this
court
required
that,
contrary
to
a
12(b)
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
a
district
court
had
to
pierce
the
veil
and
eliminate,
pierce
the
veil
of
the
pleadings
in
the
complaint
and
eliminate
the
fantastic
and
the
delusional.
clearly
the
ninth
circuit
rule
fails
as
to
the
fantastic.
there
is
no
judicial
notice
to
be
made
that
a
plaintiff
is
not
satan
or
mohammed
or
a
martian.
these
fantastic
cases
prove
that
the
exclusive
judicial
notice
rule
cannot
be
left
in
place.
the
present
case
presents
the
other
half
of
neitzke,
the
delusional
cases.
within
the
corners
of
these
five
complaints
is
ample
proof
of
a
diagnosed
delusional
condition
and
of
perceptions
which
not
only
defy
the
principles
of
formal
logic
but
also
defy
common
sense,
and
in
fact
are
perfectly
predictable
from
the
initial
medical
diagnosis
in
the
record.
this
is
an
individual
who
is
incapable
of
reasoning
in
an
appropriate
manner.
we
do
not
say
that
because
he
is
ill
his
complaints
must
be
ignored.
but
because
he
is
ill
his
perceptual
apparatus
is
seriously
wanting.
mr.
james
ching
the
use
of
the
term
credibility
i
believe
is
an
unfortunate
one,
my
point
being
that
there
is
no
evaluation
of
a
witness'
testimony
made
within
the
four
corners
of
the
five
complaints.
mr.
james
ching
i
agree
with
you
as
to
the
evaluation
that
must
be
made
of
the
unsupported
allegations.
the
issue
of
the
supporting
affidavits
does
tend
to
lend
credibility
to
the
allegations
that
are
referred
to--
mr.
james
ching
--your
honor,
i
would
say--
mr.
james
ching
--on
its
face,
read
without
the
context
of
the
five
complaints,
it
would
survive
a
frivolity
determination,
and
indeed
it
might
very
well
survive
a
12(b)(5),
12(b)(6)
rather.
there
is
a
range
of
rationality
within
the
complaints.
as
to
whether
or
not
all
would
survive
is
a
matter
that
i
think
is
at
first
instance
entrusted
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
however,
the
larger
context
and
the
context
to
which
the
magistrate
referred
in
dismissing
these
complaints
is
that
the
seemingly
rational
is
in
fact
tainted
by
the
less
rational
contained
in
the
grouping.
mr.
james
ching
well,
insofar
as
what
the
trial
judge
should
be
doing
in
evaluating
a
complaint,
he
should
be
attempting
to
pierce
the
veil,
whatever
that
means,
in
neitzke
terms.
neitzke
states
that
a
12(b)(5),
12(b)(6)
cannot
be
based
on
a
credibility
determination.
i
believe
there
is
an
inference
in
neitzke
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
go
beyond
the
mere
surface
reading
of
it
and
is
entitled
to
take
both
judicial
notice
and
to
make
rational
connections
amongst
the
parts
of
the
complaints
that
appear
before
it.
the--
mr.
james
ching
--it
was
not,
it
was
not
formally
stated
to
be
either.
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
intended
it--
mr.
james
ching
--the
denial
of
in
forma
pauperis
was
all
the
court
intended.
mr.
james
ching
yes,
your
honor,
i,
it
is--
mr.
james
ching
--the
dismissal
is
one
which
simply
denies
ifp.
i
see
no
greater
significance
to
it.
the
ninth
circuit
has
in
fact
taken
the
position
by
requiring
not
only
the
objective
judicial
notice
rule,
but
also
the
de
novo
review
on
appeal,
and
also
the
reporting
requirements
to
the
inmate,
that
is
reporting
to
the
inmate
how
the
complaint
is
deficient,
that
no
subjectivity
should
enter
into
this
process.
i
think
that
is
fundamentally
contrary
to
the
position
set
forth
in
the
cases
that
relate
to
39.8,
excuse
me,
38.9...
39.8...
in
any
case,
this
court's
rule
regarding
frivolity.
the
term
frivolous
is
inherently
subjective.
it
is
inherently
judgmental.
it
is,
it
can
only
be
based--
mr.
james
ching
--certainly
not.
this
court
has
always
adhered
to
the
rule
that
the
frivolous
case
is
one
that
is
inarguable
in
law
or
fact.
this,
in
a
case
that
presented
an
arguable
legal
claim--
mr.
james
ching
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
ching
--the
standard
set
forth
in
39.8
is
the
same
that
is
set
forth
in
1915(d),
and
is
perfectly
consistent
with
any
theory
that
this
court
has
inherent
power
to
order
its
own
business.
mr.
james
ching
within
the
terms
of
the
rules,
and
of
course
the
different
subject
matter
and
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
that
may
be
true.
however,
frivolous
seems
to
have
a
unitary
meaning
within
the
three
contexts.
the
1915
use
of
frivolous
seems
to
be
the
same
as
in
39.8.
mr.
james
ching
i
believe
that
would
be
one
consequence
of
a
discretionary
interpretation
of
frivolity,
and
yet
i
believe
we
have
to
entertain
a
discretionary
interpretation
of
frivolity
because
there
is
no
substantial
means
to
assure
a
perfectly
uniform
result
in
each
application
to
the
various
district
courts.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
by
the
united
states
that
the
terms
used
in
rule
11,
not
well
grounded
in
law,
are
interpretable
or
applicable
to
the
frivolity
determination
in
1915(d).
this
is
a
rule
that
has
its
basis
in
the
arguments
that
were
pointed
out
in
the
dissents,
that
the
fundamental
basis
for
requiring
a
frivolity
determination
is
to
ensure
that
an
economically
feasible
litigation
comes
before
the
court.
rule
11
attempts
to
apply
some
kind
of
economic
calculus
to
the
actions
of
counsel
in
bringing
litigation
and
it
relies
on,
it
has
a
well-formed
case
law
which
in
fact
could
be
applicable
to
the
determination
of
frivolity
in
this
instance.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
mr.
james
ching
it's
my
understanding
that
the
united
states'
position
applies
only
to
the
importation
of
the
test
itself
and
rather
than
the
utilization
of
sanctions.
certainly
it
would
be
futile
against
indigent
plaintiffs.
however,
the
attempt
to
require
plaintiffs
to
make
that
decision
or
be
held
to
that
standard
is
a
unitary
one.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
ching
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
was
correct
in
stating
that
there
has
been
an
accretion
of
miscellaneous
procedures,
all
of
them
unauthorized
by
law,
such
as
the
spears
and
martinez
reports,
such
as
holding
these
complaints
in
some
file,
such
as
requiring
or
in
fact
encouraging
fact
pleading
rather
than
notice
pleading
in
these
instances.
these
measures
are
inappropriate
for
this
lowest
tier
of
decisions
to
be
made
by
the
district
court.
neitzke
pointed
out
there
is
a
difference
between
summary
judgment
and
1915(d).
similarly
there
is
a
difference
between
1915(d)
and
summary...
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
1915(d)
has
a
purpose.
it
is
presumptively
supposed
to
do
something.
it
is
supposed
to
screen
frivolous
cases
out.
this
is
not
a
decision
that
requires
a
panoply
of
procedures,
nor
does
it
require
adversaries
be
summoned
to
report
on
the
true
facts
of
the
situation.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
but
my
interpretation
of
the
words,
in
reading
both
opinions,
is
that
fantastic
and
delusional
must
be
established
by
judicial
notice.
mr.
james
ching
i
believe
i
must
disagree
with
that.
it
is
a
rational
attempt
to
make
sense
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
says.
however,
judicial
notice
is
quite
clear.
we
have
a
rule
that
states
what
judicial
notice
can
be
taken
of.
mr.
james
ching
well,
it
states
that
there
is
permissive
and
mandatory
judicial
notice
available
of
such
facts
in
a
general
group
that
are
beyond
question,
statutes
of
the
united
states--
mr.
james
ching
--yes.
and
so
by
extension
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
that
a
court
could
in
good
faith
take
judicial
notice
that
there
are
no
martians.
therefore
we're
left--
mr.
james
ching
--i
think
the
court
did
in
fact
mean
mars.
it
meant--
mr.
james
ching
--you
certainly
did
not,
your
honor.
you
meant
exactly
the
opposite.
you
meant
a
subjective
common
sense
determination,
ab
initio,
without
an
accretion
of
procedures.
mr.
james
ching
well,
i
must
say
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
it
as
well.
mr.
james
ching
exactly.
well,
judicial
notice
is
the
wrong
term.
this
is--
mr.
james
ching
--yes,
they
do.
mr.
james
ching
in
both
opinions.
they
are
quite
firm
and
they
refer
to
the
rule
itself.
this
is
the
problem.
mr.
james
ching
the
problem
is
the
term
of
art
cannot
be
utilized
in
this
context
with
any
rational,
legitimate
administrative
justification.
there
is
no
judicial
notice
possible
that
there
are
no
martians.
hence
mr.
hernandez
will
prosecute
a
martian
complaint.
certainly
if
it's
well
pleaded
it
will
go
through
12(b)(5),
12(b)(6)
rather.
if
it's,
if
the
people
cannot
produce
evidence,
the
defendants,
that
there
are
no
martians,
it
passes
summary
judgment.
we
have
to
go
to
trial
and
ask
the
jury
what
essentially
the
judge
should
have
done
in
the
first
place.
we
will
have
to
ask
the
jury
whether
it's
rational
to
believe
there
are
martians
who
are
prosecuting,
who
are,
with
the
aid
of
the
department
of
corrections,
persecuting--
mr.
james
ching
--very
well.
and
imagine
discovery,
you
know.
the
problems
are
rife,
and
the
problems
arise
because
the
trial
court
under
the
ninth
circuit
doctrine
is
not
given
sufficient
leeway
to
make
these
rational
decisions.
mr.
james
ching
i
would
say
within
the
context
of
these
five,
yes.
he
supplied
us
his
entire
medical
data.
we
know
he
is
a
diagnosed
psychotic.
we
know
he
is
taking
drugs
for
this
condition.
mr.
james
ching
i
am
prepared
to
admit
there
is
a
range
of
possibilities
that
he
can
create
and
he
has
created.
any
lawyer
worth
his
salt
can
figure
out
which
ones
are
going
to
have
the
best
chance
of
succeeding.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
i
believe
that--
mr.
james
ching
--there
is
a
smaller
context,
and
with
great
solicitude
you
can
isolate
any
one
of
these
pleadings
and
make
sense
of
them.
but
you're
not
required
to
interpret
this
in
an
isolated
context.
when
a
complaint
comes
to
the
court
it
is
to
consider
the
whole
complaint.
mr.
james
ching
oh,
certainly
not.
my
point
here,
though,
is
this
particular
psychosis
is
one
that
affects
perception
and
the
ability
to
deal
and
frame
complaints
which
have
some
basis
in
reality.
well,
i
am
perfectly
pleased
to
submit
the
matter
at
this
point.
