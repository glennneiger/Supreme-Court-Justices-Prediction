mr.
dane
r.
gillette
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
like
coleman
v.
thompson
last
term,
this
is
a
case
about
federalism.
specifically,
it
deals
with
the
extent
to
which
a
federal
court
may
review
the
admission
of
evidence
in
a
state
criminal
trial
pursuant
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
although
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
a
defendant
may
be
denied
due
process
if
his
trial
is
not
fundamentally
fair,
and
has
also
noted
that
the
test
for
evaluating
fundamental
fairness
is
less
demanding
than
the
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
test
of
chapman
v.
california,
it
has
not
provided
any
specific
guidance
to
assist
the
lower
federal
courts
in
evaluating
such
cases.
while
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
bright
lines
are
difficult
to
draw
in
an
area
as
amorphous
as
due
process,
we
nevertheless
believe
that
some
more
specific
guidance
can
be
provided,
and
that
this
case
illustrates
the
need
for
precisely
that
type
of
guidance.
i
want
to
touch
very
briefly
upon
a
few
of
the
facts
in
the
case
which
will
highlight
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
and
then
turn
to
the
two-part
test
which
we
propose,
and
discuss
the
reasons
why
we
urge
its
adoption
upon
this
court.
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted,
in
1982,
by
a
jury
in
oakland,
california,
of
second
degree
murder.
the
victim
was
his
6-month-old
child,
tori.
tori
was
brought
to
the
hospital
emergency
room
on
july
7,
1981,
by
respondent
and
his
wife.
she
was
pronounced
dead
40
minutes
later.
testimony
from
the
coroner
and
the
pediatrician
who
examined
her
in
the
emergency
room
established
that
she
had
sustained
significant
injury
as
a
result
of
a
beating.
there
were
contusions
on
her
chest
and
abdomen,
and
there
was
massive
damage
to
her
internal
organs.
both
of
those
witnesses
were
allowed
to
testify
as
experts
that
tori
was
the
victim
of
battered
child
syndrome.
in
support
of
that
diagnosis,
the
experts
were
also
allowed
to
refer
to
trauma
apart
from
the
injuries
which
had
resulted
or
which
had
caused
the
death
of
the
child...
specifically,
two
earlier
injuries:
a
tearing
wound
to
the
rectum,
and
evidence
of
previously
broken
ribs,
or
fractured
ribs.
neither...
that
injury
was
not
completely
healed
yet.
both
of
those
injuries
were
at
least
several
weeks
old.
the
diagnosis
of
battered
child
syndrome,
as
well
as
the
admission
of
the
priors
as
a
part
of
the
prior
injuries,
as
a
part
of
that,
was
admitted
pursuant
to
long-standing
and
accepted
california
case
law,
permitting
the
battered
child
syndrome.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
to
establish,
specifically,
that
this
child's
death
was
not
an
accident;
that
she
was
intentionally
killed.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
it
was
offered
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
the
death
was
intentional.
there
has
been
an
argument
made
that
the
jury
might
have
used
it
as
a
result--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--no,
your
honor,
battered
child
syndrome
does
not
identify
the
perpetrator
of
the
offense.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
argument
has
been
made
that
a
jury
might
so
interpret
the
instruction.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
instruction
referred
to
evidence
of
prior
acts
by
the
defendant.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--well,
the
battered
child
syndrome
evidence...
there
were...
in
addition
to
that
part
of
the
instruction,
which
your
honor
has
read,
and
an...
admonition
to
the
jury
not
to
consider
any
of
that
as
evidence
of
character,
of
disposition,
they
were
told
that
there
was
three,
specific
purposes
for
which
other
crimes,
or
other
acts
evidence
was
proper
in
this
case.
one
was
to
impeach
the
testimony
of
the
wife.
the
wife
testified
that
she
did
it.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
to
the
extent
that
it
encompassed
the
prior
injuries,
i
would
suspect
that
it
did.
because
one
of
the
bases
that
the--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
well,
i
agree
that
this
instruction
was
not
as
clearly
worded
as
perhaps
it
could
have
been.
it
is...
it's
also
clear,
though,
that
the
jury
was
instructed
that
before
they
could
use
any
evidence
of
prior
acts,
whether
it
was
the
assaults
on
the
wife...
which
came
in
to
impeach
her
testimony...
or
the
evidence
of
observations
by
neighbors
of
his
handle...
brutal
handling
of
the
child,
or
if
it
was
the
prior
injuries,
that
they
could
only
use
that
evidence
if
they
found
a
clear
connection
between
the
prior
acts
and
the
crime
in
this
case...
such
that
it
would
permit
them
to
make
a
reasonable
inference
that
having
committed
one,
the
defendant
had
committed
the
other.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
it
certainly
may
be
a
reasonable
inference.
in
this
case--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i
think
that's
very
often,
often
the
case.
and
in
this
situation
there
were
only
two
people
who
could
have
committed
this
crime.
it
was
either
the
respondent,
or
it
was
his
wife.
and
in
addition
to
the
other
testimony,
there
was
also
evidence
presented
by
the...
through
prior
statements
of
the
wife,
that
on
earlier
occasions
before
the
death
of
the
child,
she
had
observed
bruises
on
the
child.
and
when
asked...
when
the
husband
was
asked,
the
respondent
was
asked
about
that,
he
hadn't
of...
had
no
explanation
to
offer.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
we
do
not
perceive
that
as
being
a
constitutional
issue.
we
see,
really,
a
separation
of
the
two
parts
of
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
there
was
error
in
the
admission
of
the
battered
child
evidence,
and
of
the
prior
acts,
which
were
offered
in
support
of
it,
specifically
finding
that
that
evidence
came
in
in
violation
of
california
law.
clearly,
that
was
an
inappropriate
determination
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
make.
they
had
no
business
reevaluating
california
law.
california
courts
had
held...
the
california
court
of
appeal,
had
specifically
held
that
that
evidence
was
admissible
and
proper
under
california
law,
and
i
think
it
must
be
accepted
as
a
given,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
the
battered
child--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--precisely,
your
honor.
in
the
long
run,
i
think
that
it
doesn't
matter
so
much
whether
the
california
court
was
right
or
wrong.
the
question
is,
the
evidence
having
come
in,
this
evidence
not
being
shown
to
violate
any
specific
protection
or
guarantee
of
the
bill
of
rights,
can
the
defendant,
nevertheless,
establish
that
its
use
in
this
case
denied
him
a
fundamentally
fair
trial?
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
is
precisely
right,
your
honor.
and
when
i
say
right
or
wrong,
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
the
california
court
in
this
case
had
found
that
it
was
admissible
under
california
law,
or
if
it
had
found
that
it
was
inadmissible
under
california
law.
and
i
want
to
talk
about
the...
primarily
about
the
question
of
the
admission
of
the
evidence,
and
the
extent
to
which
the
admission
of
evidence--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--for
constitutional
purposes,
i
think
it
makes
no
difference.
the
first
question
is,
was
this
evidence
properly
evidence.
the
second
issue
is--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i
don't
think
that
states
a
constitutional
issue,
your
honor.
the
extent
to
which
the
instruction
may
have
permitted
that,
does
not
necessarily
establish
that
had
it
been
used
by
the
jury
for
that
purpose,
that
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
fundamentally
unfair
trial
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
precisely.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that's
correct.
and
the
battered
child
syndrome
does
have
added
significance
with
respect
to
who
did
it
in
this
case.
because
very
often,
a
part
of
that
diagnosis,
in
addition
to
the
observation
of
the
actual
injuries
which
the
child
has
sustained,
is
evidence
of
an
inconsistent
or
impossible
explanation
offered
by
a
care-giver...
and
we
use
that
term
advisedly...
as
to
how
the
child
may
have
been
injured.
in
this
case,
on
multiple
occasions...
to
his
wife,
to
the
emergency
room
nurse,
to
the
police...
the
defendant,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
insisted
that
tori
had
fallen
off
of
the
couch.
yet
the
medical
evidence
demonstrate,
persuasively,
that
there
was
no
possibility
that
a
fall
by
a
6-month-old
child,
whether
it
was
sixteen
inches,
as
the
distance
was
measured
from
the
couch
to
the
carpeted
floor
in
this
case...
or
even
16
feet...
could
have
resulted
in
that
type
of
massive
internal
and
external
injuries.
in
short,
the
battered
child
syndrome,
in
part,
was
supported
by
the
fact
the
defendant
gave
a
completely
inconsistent
and
impossible
explanation.
now,
that
brings
us
back
again
to
the
question
that
i
want
to
primarily
discuss
with
the
court,
if
i
may,
for
a
few
minutes...
and
that
is
the
issue
of
to
what
extent,
and
what
is
the
process
by
which
a
federal
court
should
consider
the
issue
of
whether
evidence
came
into
the
case
in
violation
of
due
process,
when
there
has
been
no
showing
of
a
specific
violation
of
a
guarantee
of
the
bill
of
rights.
and
we
think
that
there
is
a
two-part
analysis,
a
very
limited
analysis
that
would
be
appropriate
for
the
federal
court
to
undertake
in
a
case
of
that
sort.
the
first
question
the
federal
court
should
ask
is
was
it
relevant?
if
it
was
relevant,
we
submit
that
due
process
has
been
satisfied.
if
it
was
not
relevant,
the
next
step
for
the
court
to
determine,
the
federal
court,
is
was
it
inflammatory?
and
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
was
inflammatory,
we
submit
as
appropriate
the
test
which
this
court
has
used
in
other
situations
for
evaluating
due
process
violations...
specifically,
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
had
this
evidence
been
excluded,
there
would
have
been
a
different
result
in
this
case.
from
by
a
reasonable--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--because--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i'm
sorry.
because
i
think
that
you
need
to
separate
it
into
two,
separate
issues.
i
think
the
first,
primary
constitutional
issue
was,
was
this
evidence
even
admissible
by
due
process?
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
you
look
to
the
instruction,
but
you're
looking
for
something
different
in
that
situation.
you're
looking...
and
i
think
appropriately
you
would
use
the
test
the
court
stated
in
boyde
v.
california.
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
was
misled
in
a
way
that
would
allow
them
to
use
this
evidence
in
some
unconstitutional
or
inappropriate
manner?
and
it
has
to
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
in
the
way
that
it
was
used.
now,
if
the
jury
were
to
consider
this
evidence
as
evidence
directly
of
guilt,
that
they
conclude
that
the
defendant
committed
those
two
prior
injuries,
and
as
a
result
they're
convinced
that
he
committed
the
murder
with
which
he
was
charged,
in
order
to
do
that,
under
the
instruction
in
this
case,
they
have
to
find
a
clear
connection
between
the
prior
injuries
and
the
injuries
that
resulted
in
the
child's
death.
i
think
that's
an
important
point
to
emphasize,
because
the
ninth
circuit
consistently
has
misquoted
that
instruction,
by
leaving
out
the
requirement
that
the
connection
be
clear.
i
do
not
think
due
process
is...
is
violated
if
a
defendant's
conviction
is
based
upon
part
on
the
use
of
evidence
from
a
jury
which...
in
which
they
found
a
clear
connection
between
prior
acts
and
the
acts
that
were
specifically
charged,
so
that
they
can
reasonably
conclude
the
defendant
must
have
committed
them.
now,
there
is
one
other
possible
use
that
has
been
suggested,
that
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
jury
in
this
particular
case,
given
this
instruction.
and
that
would
be
to
establish
the
defendant
had
some
general,
criminal
disposition
that
he
was
just
basically
a
real
bad
guy.
and
as
a
result,
his
character
was
such
that
the
jury
should
convict
him
alone
on
that
evidence
has
been
suggested
in
one
of
the
amici
brief
in
support
of
respondent,
that
reaching
that
conclusion
or
an
instruction
permitting
that
inference
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
problem,
however,
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
even
if
the
jury
drew
an
inference
of
character,
it
would
be
drawing
an
inference
of
general
character
or
disposition.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
i
don't
be--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--well,
our
test,
with
respect
to
inflammatory,
is
first
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
found
to
be
irrelevant
before
you
get
to
the
issue
of
it
being
inflammatory.
with
respect
to
the
instruction,
that's
a
somewhat
different
issue.
if
it
were
admitted
solely
on
that
ground,
we
think
that
it
would
be
relevant,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry
as
far
as
due
process
was
required.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment...
based
on
any
cases
which
this
court
has
decided...
establishes
that
general
character
evidence
would
violate
due
process.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
may
have
misspoken.
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
irrelevant.
i
think
that
would
be.
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that
once
the
federal
court
had
determined
that
it
was
relevant,
constitutionally--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--that
would
be
the
end
of
the
discussion
for
their
purposes.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
we
are
using
relevance,
your
honor,
in
the
very
broad
sense
that
this
court
used
it
in
new
jersey
v.
tlo,
in
which
it
suggested
that
evidence
is
universally
recognized
as
relevant
if
it
has
a
tendency
to
prove
any
fact
of
consequence
to
the
action
that
is
being
tried.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
certainly
its
relevance
to
the
particular
action
that's
on
trial.
for
example--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i
wouldn't
even
go
that
far,
your
honor.
because
i
think
the
syndrome
evidence
is
admissible
right
from
the
start,
in
any
case
in
which...
whether
it's
a
murder,
or
it's
a
child
abuse--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
this
evidence
would
always
be
relevant
to
prove
that
in
a
case
where
the
prosecution
must
establish
that
the
child
was
intentionally
injured
or
killed...
and
in
this
case,
the
prosecution,
to
establish
second
degree
murder
under
california
law
had
to
prove
an
intent
to
kill...
that
evidence
of
the
battered
child
syndrome
would
assist
the
prosecution
in
making
that
point.
it
wouldn't
matter
who
actually
committed
the
crime.
because
neither
of
the
experts...
the
pathologist,
nor
the
pediatrician
who
had
examined
the
child
in
the
emergency
room...
testified
as
to
who
did
it.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
it
may
not,
as
to...
it--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--to
be
foundational
in
this
case,
would
not
require
linking
to
a
particular
defendant.
it
requires
showing
that
it
has
relevance
to
proving
a
fact
in
this
case.
the
fact
in
this
case
was
the
intent
to
kill.
and
it
was
certainly
relevant
to
prove
that
point.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yeah--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--well,
i
think
that...
the
problem
is,
that
the
trial
judge
was
not
as
careful
in
the
wording
of
this
instruction.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
and
my
submission
to
you,
your
honor,
is
that
it
did
not.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
i
don't
think
that
would
raise
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize,
as
i
started
to
a
moment
ago,
to...
to
the
extent
we
are
talking
about
disposition
evidence
in
this
case
and
whether
it's
a
demonstration
of
bad
character,
this
is
not
a
general
disposition
case.
and
that
is
why
i
think
that
ultimately
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
analysis
by
the
amici
is
really
not
necessarily
relevant
to
this
case.
at
most,
what
the
evidence
of
the
prior
injuries
showed
was
that
if
there
was
a
linkage,
this
particular
defendant
had
a
disposition
or
tendency
to
mistreat
this
particular
victim.
this
was
specific
disposition
evidence.
it
went
to
the
relationship
between
this
defendant
and
this
victim.
and
the
california
courts
have
drawn
a
very
clear
distinction
between
that
type
of
specific
disposition
relating
to
the
relationship
between
the
victim
and
the
defendant,
as
opposed
to
some
general
type
of
character
evidence.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
precisely.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
well,
they
would
have
to
believe
it,
that's
correct.
that's
another
part
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
they
were
told
they
couldn't
use
it
for
general
disposition.
they
had
to
believe
it.
they
had
to
find
a
clear
connection,
before
they
could
use
it.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
is
also
correct.
the
instruction
does
require
it.
it's
somewhat
specific
in
that
regard.
the--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--yes,
that's
true.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
perhaps.
it
certainly...
the
instruction
could
have
been
more
carefully
worded.
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was
not
as
carefully
worded
as
it
perhaps
should
have
been,
there's
a
potential
that
a
jury
may
have
misunderstood.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
it
could
have
that...
it
could
have
that
effect.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
correct,
your
honor,
certainly
that's
the--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--well,
they--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--no,
you're
not
wrong
about
that.
they
certainly
were
not
the
events
which
led
to
the
child's
death.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
is
true.
they
may
well
have
been
precluded
from
using
it
in
any
way.
and
the
problem
i
think
the
court
got
into
was
trying
to
take
three
very
separate
types
of
what
may
be
loosely
termed
prior-act
evidence
and
putting
them
all
together
into
a
single
instruction--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--there
was...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
there
were
three
types
of
evidence
which,
i
believe,
were
governed
by
this
instruction:
one
was
the
prior
acts
that
we've
been
talking
about.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
prior
injuries
to
the
child.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
two
injuries
which
were
not
a
part
of
the
fatal
injuries,
yes.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
was
one
part
of
it.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
and
that
probably
should
have
been
separated
out,
but
it
wasn't.
the
second
type
of
prior
injury
evidence
was
testimony
that
the
defendant
had
been
brutal
in
his
treatment
of
the
wife,
and
that
she
had
previously
complained
about
his
treatment
of
her,
and
had
sought
assistance...
information
on
a
battered
wife's
shelter.
that
evidence
had
been
offered
to
impeach
her
testimony
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
defendant.
and
then
the
third
type
was
the
evidence
of
the...
specifically,
of
the
mishandling,
the
very
brutal,
mishandling
of
the
child,
that
had--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--correct,
as
well
as
mrs.
mcguire's
statement
to
friends
that
she
was
very
concerned
about
the...
respondent's
mistreatment
of
the
child.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
is
correct.
and
it
has
the
three
sub-parts
to
it:
to
impeach
mrs.
mcguire,
to
establish
battered
child
syndrome,
and
then
the
clear
connection
to
establish
its
connection.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that's
true.
and
more
importantly--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--absolutely,
and
that
other
evidence
included
not
just
that
he
was
only
one
of
two
people
who
could
do
it,
he
was
the
only
person
who
could
have
committed
this
crime.
because
he
had...
and
it
was
uncontradicted...
sole,
and
exclusive
custody
of
the
child
for
at
least
a
10-minute
period
prior
to
her
death.
and
the
medical
testimony
established
that
that
child's
death
had
to
occur
within
a
very
short
time
of
the
infliction
of
the
injuries.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
except,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--if
we
had
known
9
years
ago,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
all
would
have
happened.
but
that
is
considered
a
legitimate
part...
in
every
court
which
has
considered
the
issue
of
battered
child
syndrome,
because
all
those
previous
injuries
tend
to
show
the
pattern
that
this
child's...
what
happened
to
this
child
in
this
case
was
a
result
of
a
pattern
of
mistreatment,
and
that
her
death
could
not
have
been
accidental,
that
she
was
intentionally
killed.
and
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
that
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
in
addition
to
the
other
evidence
we've
discussed,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
sole
custody,
we
also
have
the
confrontation
between
mrs.
mcguire
and
the
respondent
in
the
emergency
room
after
the
child
has
been
brought
in.
and
mrs.
mcguire,
while
tori
is
being
treated
in
the
emergency
room,
asks
the
respondent,
point
blank,
what
happened
to
tori?
and
his
response
was,
she
fell
off
the
couch.
and
she...
mrs.
mcguire
asks
him
again,
and
he
repeats
the
same
explanation,
she
fell
off
the
couch.
and
finally
she
says
to
him,
you
are
responsible.
and
the
respondent
says
nothing.
now,
that
failure
to
respond
to
her
accusation
was
proper
evidence,
in
california,
of
a
silent
adoption
of
that
accusation...
consciousness
of
guilt.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
there
certainly
was
other
evidence.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
and
i
would
submit
that
even
if
there
was
not,
that
evidence
was
not
so
inflammatory,
given
the
overall
case,
that
there's
a
reasonable
probability.
that
had
it
been
excluded,
or
had
the
jury
not
been
allowed
to
consider
it
in
that
way,
that
it
would
have
led
to
a
different
or
more
favorable
result
for
the
respondent.
simply
put,
in
our
view,
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
this
case.
the
defendant
was...
the
respondent
was
not
denied
a
fundamentally
fair
trial.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
i
have
no
objection,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
we
use
inflammatory
based
on
language
in
this
court's
decision
in
moore
v.
illinois
that
admission
of
evidence
which
did
not
violate
state
law,
did
not
violate
due
process.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
it
was
not
irrelevant--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--that
would
ultimately
be
the
determination.
thank
you,
your
honor.
