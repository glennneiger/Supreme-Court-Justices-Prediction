ms.
ann

voris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
aggregate
effect
of
the
admittance
of
irrelevant,
highly
prejudicial
evidence,
compounded
by
the
trial
court's
instruction
to
use
that
evidence
in
the
most
prejudicial
manner
possible,
rendered
the
trial
arbitrary
and
fundamentally
unfair.
mark
mcguire
was
denied
due
process
of
law
by
the
use
of
the
prior
injury
evidence,
coupled
with
a
jury
instruction
which
gave
maximum
prejudicial
effect,
rather
than
a
limiting
effect.
the
attorney
general
has
suggested
a
test
which
requires
that
we
first
look
at
the
relevance
and
then
at
the
prejudice.
the
first
point
which
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
battered
child
syndrome
evidence...
the
battered
child
syndrome
could
have
been
proven
without
the
prior
injuries,
at
all.
the
battered
child
syndrome
can
be,
and
dr.
levine
testified,
that
the
battered
child
syndrome
could
be
proven
with
the
acts
which
took
place
which
killed
the
child.
none
the...
so,
i'm
not
sure
that
even
on
the
threshold
test
of
relevance,
that
this
evidence
passes
the
threshold
test.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
i
do
not
believe
so.
in
fact,
justice
o'connor,
the
defendants
proposed
a
jury
instruction
at
the
time,
which
stated
that
evidence
of
prior
injuries
have...
has
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
tori...
tori
mcguire
suffered
from
the
battered
child
syndrome.
such
evidence,
if
believed,
was
not
received,
and
may
not
be
considered
by
you
to
prove
that
defendant
is
a
person
of
bad
character,
or
that
he
has
a
disposition
to
commit
crimes.
such
evidence
was
received,
and
may
be
considered
by
you
only
for
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
if
it
tends
to
show
the
injuries
suffered
by
tori
mcguire,
july
7,
1981,
were
not
accidental.
that
was
the
defendant's
proposed
jury
instruction.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
no,
i'm
not.
under
california
law,
that
evidence
can
be
admitted.
under
federal
law,
that
evidence
can
be
admitted.
battered
child
syndrome
evidence
is
admissible.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
justice
scalia,
that
hypothetical
tracks
exactly
united
states
v.
woods,
wherein
the
federal
court
stated
that
it
was
proper
to
admit
battered
child...
the
evidence
of
her
previous
seven
children.
mrs.
woods
had
all
these
children
which
died
of
sudden
infant
death
syndrome,
or
various
forms
of
strangulation.
and
finally
when
the
court
determined
that
all
her
previous
children
had
died,
then
they
were
able
to
use
that
evidence
for
battered
child
syndrome
purposes.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
that--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--first,
because
the
murder,
itself,
was
sufficient
to
prove
the
battered
child
syndrome;
and
second,
because
there
was
absolutely
nothing
tying
him
to
these
prior
injuries.
there
must
be
a
foundational
requirement.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
that's
correct.
and
the
other
person
testified
on
the
stand
that
she
committed
not
only
the
acts
which
led
to
the
infant's
death,
but
also
the
acts
which
were
a
part
of
the
prior
injuries.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that's
precisely
the
reason
that
character
evidence
is
excluded,
and
similar
evidence
is
excluded
without
a
foundation
to
be
shown,
because
the
inference
to
be
drawn
is
so
powerful.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
yes,
it's
as...
as
justice
kennedy
used
the
term
super-relevant.
and
as
justice
cardozo
had
said,
the
natural
and
inevitable
tendency
to
give
character
evidence
excessive
weight,
justifies
condemnation
to
the
jury,
irrespective
of
the
guilt
on
the
present
charge.
and
in--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--what
i'm
doing,
your
honor,
is
what
happened
here
was--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--yes.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
yes.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
my
belief
is
that
every
single
state
of
the
union,
and
every...
and
the
federal
system
requires
that
there
be
an
analysis
of
the
evidence
prior
to
its
admission.
and
in
this
case,
when
the
analysis
was
to
be
undertaken,
the
court
was
told
and
believed
that
no
analysis
was
necessary.
this
position
is
still
being
taken,
that
this
prior...
that
battered
child
syndrome
evidence
is
admissible,
without
any
guidance
regarding
the
characters
in
terms
of
similars.
now,
what
happened
in
this
case,
was
then
an
instruction
was
given,
which
took
it
from
being
battered
child
syndrome
evidence
to
rebut
an
accident
defense,
and
turned
it
into
similars
evidence,
by
means
of
a
connection
made
by
the
instruction...
not
by
the
evidence.
and
what
happened
also
is
that
intent
and
identity
were
provided
not
by
evidence
in
this
case,
but
by
this
instruction.
and
in
so
doing,
the
burden
of
proof
was
shifted,
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
was
taken
away.
when
that
happened,
fundamental
fairness
was
taken
away,
and
due
process
was
denied.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
yes.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
the
way
it
did
was
that
it...
it
gave
the
jury
permission
to
identify...
an
argument
was
made
that
the
evidence
could...
some
facts
do
double
duty,
it
was
argued.
and
so
the...
the
evidence
was
admitted
for
one
purpose.
and
then
it
was
used,
through
the
means
of
the
instruction,
for
an
entirely
different
purpose,
to
establish
his
bad
character.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
simply
the
admission
of
the
evidence.
it's
the
evidence,
coupled
with
this
erroneous
jury
instruction.
in--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--well--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--at
one
point
it
said...
it
did
say
that.
but
the
rest
of
the
instruction--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
portion
of
the
instruction
was
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
that
portion
of
the
instruction
was
in
accordance
with
california
law.
the
rest
of
the
instruction
negated
that
portion
of
the
instruction
which
said...
that
dealt
with
the
disposition.
and
i'm
referring
to
the
instruction
which
is
on
page
6
of
respondent's
brief,
which
states
that
evidence
has
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
defendant
committed
acts
similar
to
those
constituting
a
crime
other
than
that
for
which
he's
on
trial.
now,
that
very
first
line
designates
the
evidence
as
being
similar,
in
advance.
it
was
not
introduced
for
the
purposes
of
being
similar
evidence.
it
was
introduced
for
the
purposes
of
the
battered
child
syndrome
only
and
to
negate
a
potential
accident
defense.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
yes,
it
not
only
told
them
that
it
had
to
find
that
he
committed
them--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--i
believe
that
it
told
them
both...
that
it
said,
this
is
similar
evidence,
this
is
evidence
of
similar
crimes.
and
it
then
went
on
to
say
that...
it
was...
such
evidence
was
received,
and
may
be
considered
by
you
only
for
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
if
it
tends
to
show
three
things:
(1)
the
impeachment
of
daisy
mcguire's
testimony
that
she
had
no
cause
to
be
afraid
of
the
defendant;
(2)
to
establish
the
battered
child
syndrome;
and
(3)
also
a
clear
connection
between
the
other
two
offenses
and
the
one
of
which
the
defendant
is
accused,
so
that
it
may
be
logically
concluded
that
if
the
defendant
committed--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--he
also
committed
the
crime
charged
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
right,
and
the
question
here
is
why
didn't
the
court
use
this
particular
instruction,
proposed
by
the
defense
attorney,
which
said
prior
injuries.
it
specified
them...
rather
than--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
that's
correct.
however,
the
problem
with
this
instruction
is
that
it
says...
it
refers
to
other
offenses.
also
included
in
here
are
the
incident
where
he
slapped
his
wife,
the
incident
where
he
carried
his
baby
by
one
arm.
those
matters,
those
were
introduced
and
argued
by
the
prosecutor
to
prove
the
point
that
the
violent
person
in
this
household
was
mr.
mcguire.
you
must--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
did
the
trial
attorney
object
to
the
evidence?
yes.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
i
believe
so,
although
there
was
some
discussion,
which
i
did
cite
in
my
brief,
that
she
acceded
to
the
evidence
regarding
the
pinched
cheeks
on
the
ground
that
she
did
not
believe,
and
she
understood
from
the
previous
discussions,
that
that
would
not
be
associated
with
the
prior
injuries
to
the
baby.
so
i
cannot
say
unequivocally
that
she
did
object.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
except
that
the
other
offenses
aren't
identified.
when
you
throw
into
an
instruction
evidence
of
prior
violence
and
tell
the
jury
that
if
you
believe
that
he
committed
these
other
offenses,
and
they're
not
identified...
and
in
fact,
there
is
reference
to
the
impeachment
of
daisy
mcguire,
in
that
he
slapped
his
wife,
and
therefore
she
was
intimidated,
and
therefore,
that
is
therefore
that
is
the
reason
that
she
testified
that
she
committed
the
murder
of
her
own
baby
and
that
she
committed
the
other
acts
which
were
used
against
him...
and
throw
that
in
with
the
establishment
of
the
battered
child
syndrome,
and
then
tell
the
jury
that
it
can
make
a
clear
connection
between
the
other
two
offenses
and
the
one
of
which
the
defendant
is
accused,
so
that
it
may
be
logically
concluded
that
if
the
defendant
committed
other
offenses,
he
also
committed
the
crime
charged
in
this
case.
the
other
offenses
were
not
murder,
and
the
other
offenses
are
being
used
to
conclusively
tell
the
jury
to...
to
use
the
prior
injuries
to
identify
him
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
the
constitution
requires
that
the
hypothetical
be,
as
you
expressed
it,
that
it
be
the
prior
behavior
of
the
defendant,
that
it
not
just
be
some...
an
act
which
took
place
at
an
unknown
time,
by
an
unknown
person,
in
an
unknown
place,
with
no
witnesses...
except
a
witness
who
said
she
did
it...
and
be
used
against
the
defendant
in
that
case.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
there
must
be
some
tie
to
the
defendant.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
right.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
his
question.
my
understanding
of
the
hypothetical...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
was
that
you
have
five
prior
cases.
where...
and
the
cases...
there
are
a
legion
of
cases
where
some...
where
babies
are
brought
in,
and
they've
got
bumps
on
their
heads,
and
their
fathers
bring
them
in,
and
it
happens
time
after
time
after
time.
and
finally,
the
baby
dies,
or
some
terrible
neglect
takes
place.
and
there...
results
in
peritonitis.
and
yes,
those
injuries
can
be...
all
the
previous
injuries,
which
are
tied
to
the
defendant,
can
be
brought
in
to
prove
the
battered
child
syndrome.
they
can
be
brought
in
when
the
person
trips
over
the...
says
he--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--well,
i
believe
that
under
1101(b),
and
404(b),
both
of
the
evidence
code,
if
you
have
a
modus
operandi,
if
you
have
something
that
is
an
identifying
trait
of...
that
the
court
can
use,
such
as
you're
saying,
you
know,
if
the
baby's
been
dropped
on
his
head
by
this
guy
five
previous
times,
that,
yes,
it
can
be
used.
no,
there
is
not
a
constitutional
mandate
that
says
that
evidence
cannot
be
used.
but
it
must
be
tied
to
the
defendant.
it
must
be
tied...
there
must...
there's
a
foundational
requirement.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
no.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
well,
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
being
that
it's
not
relevant
enough.
i
would
characterize
it
as...
that
the
certain
requirements
which
must
be
taken
foundationally
to
make
it
similars
evidence,
which
is
what
i
hear
you
as
talking
about,
those...
that
was
not...
that
did
not
happen
here.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
i
don't
know.
i...
my...
i
do
still
believe--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--well,
i
still
believe
that
under
the
similars
analysis,
the...
and
we
are...
we
are
discussing,
actually,
evidence
questions
here.
under
the
similars
analysis,
i
do
believe
that
there...
it
must
be
similar.
i
do
not
believe...
and
in
all
of
the
battered
child
syndrome
cases
the
evidence
was--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--well,
now,
but
if
it's
a
case
of
a
brutal
beating
versus
a
rectal
tearing,
which
is
the
only
purpose
to
bring
it
in
is
to
inflame
the
jury
and
make
them
want
to
jump
out
of
the
box
and
grab
this
by...
this
guy
by
the
throat,
then
what
you
have
is
extreme
fundamental
due
process
error.
it's
not
similars.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
i
do
not
believe
that
the
evidentiary
error
raises
this
to
a
constitutional
level,
except
for
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
which
tied
him
to
it.
there
was
no
evidence
about--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--there
was
evidence...
there
was
some
evidence
of
that.
there
was
some
evidence
also
that
he--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--i
believe
that
some
foundational
evidence
that
perhaps
he...
there
was
no
evidence
regarding
these
prior
injuries,
other
than
the
fact
that
they
happened.
there
was
no
evidence,
really...
there
was
some
evidence
as
to
time.
they
were
perhaps
5
to
8
weeks
old.
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
who
the
rib
injuries
were
inflicted,
other
than
that...
that...
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
that.
and
there
was...
the
only
evidence
regarding
the
other
injury...
the
only
eyewitness
testimony
was
from
mrs.
mcguire,
who
said
that
she
did
it
herself.
i
do
not...
i
don't
believe
that
they're
similar
enough.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
constitutional
question
here.
the
question
here
is,
if
the
evidence...
this
evidence
was
introduced
for
a
particular
purpose,
and
then
the
jury
was
instructed
to
use
it
as
character
evidence,
and
to
use
it
for
the
most
prejudicial
purpose
that
it
could--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--well,
in
so
many
words
it
was.
it
was
specifically
instructed
to
that.
but
the
rest
of
the
instruction
said,
use
it.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
yes,
i
do.
because
the
initial...
in
using
mr.
gillette's
test
of
relevance,
there
was
no
initial
reason
to
bring
this
in.
they
had
established
the
battered
child
syndrome
simply
with
the
acts
that
took
place
in
the
murder.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
no,
i
do
not
concede
that
it
was
admissible
relevant
evidence.
it
was
irrelevant
to
this,
because,
for
example,
the--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--but,
if
you
were
to
weigh
it
under
at
least
california
evidence
code
352,
the
probative
value
versus
the
prejudicial
effect,
the
prejudicial
effect
was
monumental.
and
when
coupled
with--
--well,
do
you
think
that's
a
constitutional
requirement,
the
provision
of
california
evidence
code...
whatever
number
it
is?
when
it
is
coupled
with
a
jury
instruction
which
makes
the...
permits
the
jury
to
make
a
connection
that
the
evidence
does
not
make,
that
makes
it...
brings
it
to
a
constitutional
dimension.
it
makes--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--yes,
all
previous
cases
under
california
and
federal
law--
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
--i
subscribe
to
the
view
that
all
previous
cases,
when
they
analyzed
the
evidence
on
a
foundational
level,
required
certain
foundational
matters.
those
were
not
looked
at
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
as
to
whether
that,
in
its...
on
its
own
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
look
at
that
because
when
the
jury
instruction
was
coupled
with
it,
it
completely
took
it
out
of
the
realm
of
a
fair
trial.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
the
instruction
error
was
preserved.
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
discuss
it
at
all.
and
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed,
and
the
rehearing
was
denied.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
yes.
ms.
ann
hardgrove
voris
that's
correct.
