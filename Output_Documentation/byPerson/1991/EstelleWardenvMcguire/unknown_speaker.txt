unknown
speaker
mr.
gillette,
now
that
evidence,
the
battered
child
syndrome
evidence,
is
relevant
for
what
purpose?
unknown
speaker
was
it
used
in
this
case
for
any
other
purpose?
unknown
speaker
it
was
offered
as
a
means
of
linking
the
defendant
with
the
injuries?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
talking
about
what
happened
in
this
case.
what...
there
was
an
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that
instruction,
apparently,
said
that
the
evidence
could
be
used
to
show
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime
charged?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
what
the
instruction
said?
unknown
speaker
it
said
evidence
has
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
defendant
committed
acts
similar
to
those
constituting
a
crime
other
than
that
for
which
he
is
on
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
what
evidence
was
that?
did
that
encompass
the
battered
child
syndrome
evidence?
unknown
speaker
did
that
evidence,
referred
to
in
the
instruction,
include
the
battered
child
syndrome
evidence?
unknown
speaker
is
to
establish
the
battered
child
syndrome.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
the
jury
was
told
that
it
could
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
also
committed
the
crime
charged.
and
that
does
not
seem
to
track
what
you
say
was
the
use,
the
relevance
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
california
courts
have
acknowledged,
haven't
they,
that
this
is
an
inevitable
inference,
if
the
defendant
is
one
of
the
few
people
with
custody
of
the
child,
and
the
child
has
a
series
of
injuries
over
a
period
of
time,
it's
almost
inevitable
that
the
jury
will
conclude
that
this
defendant
was
either
the
prime
suspect
or
the
perpetrator.
unknown
speaker
that's
almost
inescapable.
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
the
stand...
the
standard
evidence
calculus...
it's
not
necessarily
constitutional
law,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
law
of
evidence...
is
whether
or
not
the
permitted
purpose
for
which
the
evidence
is
introduced
dominates,
despite
its
prejudicial
effect
in
other
respects.
unknown
speaker
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
about
that,
in
the
end,
they
had
to
find
that
the
admission
of
the
evidence
was
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
california...
to
say
that...
whether
there...
you
know...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
california
court
was
right
or
wrong.
you
know,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
right
or
wrong,
a
state
law
and
federal
habeas.
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution,
it's
no
concern
of
the
federal
habeas
court,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
though,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
evidence
was
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
proving
the
battered
child
syndrome,
on
the
one
hand;
or
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
the
defendant
committed
the
earlier
brutal
acts,
and
therefore
to
give
rise
to
the
inference
that
he
may
also
have
committed
the
one
for
which
he
is
being
tried.
and
that
was
the
third
part
of
the
trial
judge's
instruction.
is
that
relevant
at
all,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
it
was
clearly
properly
admissible
for
the
purpose
of
proving
the
battered
child
syndrome.
does
it
also
mean
it's
properly
admissible
to
connect
the
defendant
with
the
prior
acts?
and
i...
as
i
understand
it,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
connect
him
with
the
prior
acts,
other
than
the
possibility
he
had
custody
of
the
child.
but
he
wasn't
the
only
one
with
custody
of
the
child
during
those
earlier
times,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gillette,
i
take
it
that
in
a
trial
in
which
the
defendant
is
charged
with
the...
killing
this
child,
the
state
offers
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
persuade
the
jury
that
he's
guilty.
and
that
would
include
the
evidence
of
the
battered
child
syndrome,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
to
narrow
the...
as
you
suggest...
narrow
the
possibility
to
someone
who
intentionally
did
it
to
the
child,
rather
than
accident.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gillette,
the
only
problem
i
have,
is
how
it...
how
we
should
view
the
case
in
light
of
this
misleading
instruction.
i
mean,
i
can
follow
your
argument
that
the
evidence
was
admissible
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
that
it's
relevant
to
show
that
the
prior
injuries
were
not
accidental,
and
that
this
was
not
either.
but
how
can
we
justify
the
instruction
that
tried...
said
the
jury
could
use
it
to
link
the
defendant
with
the
prior
acts--
unknown
speaker
--and
this
act?
unknown
speaker
let's
say
we
agree
with
you,
that
far.
now
don't
we
also
have
to
look,
in
this
case,
at
the
instruction
to
see
how
it
was
used?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
say
about
the
amicus
proposition?
could
there
be
an
instance...
suppose
there's
an
instruction
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
common
sense
might
tell
you
that
if
this
defendant
committed
a
murder
a
year
ago,
he
probably
committed
the
one
this
year
for
which
he's
now
on
trial...
the
grossest
form
of
prior
bad
acts
testimony.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
not
inflammatory.
your
test
is
whether
or
not
it's
inflammatory.
it's
maybe
prejudicial
and
takes
away
the
burden
of
proof
that
should
belong
to
the
government
and
so
forth,
so
forth.
it's
not
inflammatory.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
why
would
it
be
irrelevant?
why
would
it
be
irrelevant?
something
is
relevant
if
it
tends
to
show
that
it's...
if
it
is
a
fact
that
makes
it
more
likely
that
another
fact
exists
or
not?
and
you
don't
think
it's
more
likely
that
somebody
who
murdered
a
year
ago
is
guilty
of
this...
you
don't
think
that
a
person
who
murdered
before
is
more
likely
than
the
average
citizen
who
has
never
murdered,
to
have...
to
murder
again?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree,
don't
you,
that
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
relevant
constitutionally
includes
the
issue,
or
must
include
the
issue
whether
there
is
a
foundation
in
other
evidence
to
tie
potentially
relevant
evidence
to
this
specific
defendant?
in
other
words,
you're
using
relevance,
i
assume,
in
a
broad
sense,
including
foundational
evidence.
unknown
speaker
but
the
tense
is
important
there.
if
it
does
have
that
tendency...
and
evidence
does
have
that
tendency
only
if
there
is,
in
the
usual
case,
a
foundation
connecting
that
evidence
to
this
particular
defendant.
any
piece
of
evidence,
i
supposed,
theoretically
can
be
relevant.
but
it
may
not,
in
fact,
be
relevant
in
the
case
because
there's
nothing
tying
it
to
the
proposition
that
you've
got
to
prove,
nothing
tying
it
to
this
defendant.
and
so
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
when
you
say
it's
got
to
be
relevant,
i
assume
you
mean
there
has
got
to
be
a
foundation
for
its...
to
demonstrate
its
relevance.
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
this
particular
case,
if
there
is
a...
nothing
more
than
a
50/50
chance
that
at
the
time
of
the
prior
injuries
it
was
the
defendant
rather
than
the
wife
who
had
the
custody,
would
you
say
that
this
was...
that
the...
that
the
syndrome
evidence
was
relevant
based
on
that
foundation?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
were
saying,
i
think,
that
the
evidence
is
relevant,
regardless,
for
your...
for
your
constitutional
test.
the
evidence
is
relevant
regardless
of
the
foundation
which
may
tie
that
evidence
to
this
particular
defendant.
you're
not
saying...
do
you
really
mean
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
then
that
you're
saying
that
your
concept
of
relevance
does
not
include
the
kind
of
foundational
requirement
that
i'm
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
and
it
does
not
in
this
case,
i
think
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing
in
my
own
thinking?
assuming
that
the
battered
trial...
the
evidence
you
seek
to
introduce
is
three
prior
acts
of
violence
to
the
child
that
are
provable
by
medical
evidence
and
you
can
establish
the
dates
when
they
took
place.
that
would
be
admissible,
as
i
understand
your
theory...
and
i
think
i
agree
with
you...
regardless
of
whether
you
tie
that
to
the
particular
defendant?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
still
be
admissible
if,
after
it
goes
in,
the
defendant
proves
that
he
was
in
europe,
or
something
like
that,
at
the
time
of
the
earlier
incidents,
and
therefore
could
not
have
committed
those
acts.
it
would
still
be
admissible,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would...
but
it
would
not
be
admissible
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
the
defendant
committed
the
prior
acts,
unless
you
had
some
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
the
opportunity,
and
all
the
rest.
unknown
speaker
my
problem
with
this
case
is,
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
seems
to
have
told
the
jury
that
those
prior
acts
were
offenses
for
which
the
defendant
was
responsible.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
evidentiary
foundation
for
that
instruction
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
is
whether
he
made
such
a
bad
instruction
that
it
may
have
tainted
the
verdict.
unknown
speaker
did
not.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
have
if
he
had
said
to
him,
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
defendant
committed
these
prior
acts,
and
you
may
infer
from
that...
that
evidence,
that
he
also
committed
this
act.
would
that
have
been
an
unconstitutional
instruction,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
instruction
starts
out
by
saying
evidence
has
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
defendant
committed
acts
similar
to
those
constituting
a
crime
other
than
that
for
which
he
was
on
trial.
and
he
says,
such
evidence,
if
believed--
unknown
speaker
--may
be
used
for
da,
da,
da,
da.
so
i
suppose
the
jury
had
to
consider,
under
this
instruction,
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
to
believe
that
the
defendant
committed
these
prior
acts.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
had
to...
they
had
to
believe
that
the...
under
this
instruction...
that
he
committed
these
prior
acts.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
quite...
but
that
would
not
have
been
necessary
if
it
had
merely
been
offered
for
the
purpose
of
proving
battered
child
syndrome.
exactly.
unknown
speaker
and
so
this
is
a...
this
is
a...
this
goes
beyond...
this
makes
it
harder
to
use
this
evidence
than
if
you
were
just
offering
battered
child
evidence.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
this
is
more
favorable
to
the
defendant
than--
unknown
speaker
--than
just
offering...
you
could
have
gotten
in
this
battered
child
evidence
without
requiring
proof
of
the
defendant's
connection
with
the
prior
acts?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
proof
of
the
defendant's
connection
with
the
prior
acts,
was
there?
well--
--other
than
the
fact
he
carried
the
child
by
one
arm,
at
one
time,
and
pinched
her
cheeks.
and
those
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
serious
injuries
that
are
the
subject
of
this
evidence.
unknown
speaker
am
i
wrong
on
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
instruction
says
evidence
has
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
defendant
committed
those
prior
acts.
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
have
to
believe
that...
unless
the
jury
believed
that
evidence...
believed
that
the
defendant
committed
that...
committed
those
crimes,
the
evidence
shouldn't
have
been
used
by
them
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gillette,
what
was
the
evidence
referred
to
in
the
instruction
that
had
been
introduced
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
defendant
committed
acts
similar
to
those
constituting
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
exactly
what
was
that
evidence?
unknown
speaker
what
prior
acts?
unknown
speaker
the
injuries
to
the
child,
the
battered
syndrome
evidence.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
pinching,
and
the
holding
by
the
arm?
unknown
speaker
and
so
this
instruction
covers
all
those
things?
unknown
speaker
and
also
other...
i
mean,
it
was
also
shown,
was
it
not,
that
he
was
one
of
only
two
people
who
had
general
custody
of
this
child?
unknown
speaker
now
that's
not
enough
to,
alone,
establish
that
he
was
guilty.
but
it
is
certainly
highly
probative
evidence,
which,
together
with
other
evidence,
would
prove
it.
unknown
speaker
so
that
might
have
been...
it
might
have
been
smarter
not
to
even
introduce
the
prior
evidence...
evidence
of
prior
injuries.
unknown
speaker
if
you
knew
you
were
going
to
get
into
this
kind
of
trouble.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
jury
didn't
believe
that
the
defendant
committed
these
prior
acts...
why
there's
certainly
the
admission
of
this
evidence
didn't
hurt
anybody.
and
then
the
question
is,
was
there
enough
other
evidence
to
convict?
unknown
speaker
and
i
doubt
if
any
of
them
would
say
there
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
defendant...
if
the
jury
did
believe
that
he
committed
these
prior
acts,
i
suppose
there
might
be
a
question
of
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
to
sustain
that
conclusion.
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
there
probably
was.
unknown
speaker
would
you
allow
us
to
substitute
the
word
prejudicial
for
inflammatory?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
would
that
accord
with
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
gruesome
evidence,
usually--
unknown
speaker
--here
the
question
is
super-relevancy,
which
makes
it
more
probative...
so
probative
that
the
rest
of
the
trial
is
obscured,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gillette.
ms.
voris,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
voris,
suppose
that
the
trial
court
had
told
the
jury
that
they
could
only
consider
the
evidence
of
battered
child
syndrome
as
tending
to
show
that
the
child
did
not
die
accidentally,
and
the
jury
was
so
instructed,
would
you
still
be
here
arguing
that
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
ms.
voris,
why
can't
you
use
it
to
prove...
to
prove
the
crime?
suppose
a
child
has
died
from
a
punctured
lung,
the
lung
being
punctured
by
a
broken
rib.
and
the
prosecution
introduced
evidence...
introduces
evidence
that
this
defendant
has
been
one
of
two
custodians
of
a
hundred
other
children
over
the
past
2
years.
and
every
one
of
those
other
children
had
broken
ribs.
are
you
saying
that
evidence
could
not
be
admitted?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
this
is
no
the
same
child.
these
are
other
children,
other
children,
100
other
children.
and
it
is
not
being
introduced
for
showing
battered...
battered
child
syndrome.
it
is
being
introduced
to
show,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
is
it
likely,
is
it
likely
that
a
hundred
other
children,
within
the
custody
of
this
defendant
and
one
other
person,
should
all
have
broken
ribs,
just
as
this
child
does?
why
isn't
that
relevant,
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
admissible?
unknown
speaker
well,
why--
unknown
speaker
--why
isn't
this
evidence
of
the
same
sort?
this
child
had
had...
all
of
these...
child
had
these
other
injuries,
and
he
was
one
of
two
people
who
had
custody
of
her.
it
doesn't
conclusively
prove
that
he's
guilty,
but
it's...
it's
relevant
evidence,
which,
together
with
other
evidence,
can
help
a
jury
to
decide
that
he
was.
unknown
speaker
he
was
one
of
two
people,
one
of
only
two
people
who
had
continuing
custody
of
her.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you're
confusing
conclusiveness
with
relevance.
it
can
be
relevant
without
being
conclusive.
it's
just
one
of
many
pieces
of
evidence
that
lead
to
the
conclusion.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
conclusive
to
be
admitted.
surely
the
fact
that
he
was
only
one
of
two
is
something
the
jury
ought
to
know.
isn't
it
more
likely
that
he
caused
those
prior
injuries,
than
that
i
did...
much
more
likely?
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
relevance.
it's
perhaps
that
the
relevance
is
too
much,
as
you
say?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about...
are
you
calling
prior
bad
acts
evidence?
are
you
subsuming
that
under
character
evidence?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
my
question?
unknown
speaker
you
are
classifying
bad
acts
evidence
as
a
form
of
character
evidence?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
prohibition
in
the
federal
constitution
against
using
that
sort
of
evidence
to
prove
the
likelihood
of
this
particular
defendant
having
committed
the
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
how...
the
trial
court,
i
take
it,
charged
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
state,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
how
was...
how
was
admission
of
this
evidence
change
the
burden
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that
might
be
a
misuse
of
evidence,
perhaps,
or
a
use...
as
you
say,
fact...
but
i
don't
say
how
that
changes
the
burden
of
proof.
the
trial
court
clearly
charged
the
jury
where
the
burden
of
proof
was.
your
analysis
would
make
every...
almost
every
error
in
the
admission
of
evidence,
you
would
be
a
claim
that
there's
been
a
shift
in
the
burden
of
proof.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
jury
instruction
plainly
said
that
they
couldn't
use
this
evidence
of
prior
injuries
to
show
bad
character.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
it
said.
unknown
speaker
or
to
prove
that
the
defendant
has
a
disposition
to
commit
crimes.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
under
this...
these
instructions,
however,
that
the
jury
was
told
to
use
this
evidence
of
prior
injuries...
the
jury
had
to
find
that
the
defendant
committed
these
other
offenses?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
not
had
to.
not
had
to.
that
the
evidence
could
only
be
used
if
the
jury
found
that
the
defendant
committed
these
prior
offenses.
unknown
speaker
if
the
defendant
committed
other
offenses.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
jury's
going
to
have
to
find
that
the...
that
the
defendant
committed
the
prior
offenses.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
voris,
that
might
have
been
a
preferable
instruction,
the
one
you
tendered.
but
that
doesn't
render
this
conviction
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution,
that
the
trial
court
chose
between
two
instructions
and
chose
one
that
was,
perhaps,
vaguer
or
less
precise
than
the
one
you
wanted.
unknown
speaker
did
you
object
to
those
instructions?
unknown
speaker
did
you
object
to
that
evidence?
unknown
speaker
of
the
pinching
and
carrying
by
the
arm?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
your
case
is...
or
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be...
that
the
jury
was
told
that
this
evidence
proved
the
acts.
and
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
this
is
a
question
for
the
jury
to
determine.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fairest
reading
of
part
3
of
this
instruction
is
that
this
is
for
the
jury
to
determine.
the
word
"if",
as
justice
white
points
out.
there's
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that's
true,
ms.
voris,
and
you're
right,
that
generally
speaking,
certainly
in
federal
court
and
most
state
courts
i'm
familiar
with
you
don't
let
in
evidence
of
prior
character
like
that.
but
let's
assume
we
have
a
state
that
wants
to
do
it.
why
is
it
unconstitutional
to
do
that?
why
is
it
unconstitutional
to
say,
look
it,
this
person
beat
the
child
within
an
inch
of
its
life
on
five
other
occasions.
we
think
the
jury
should
know
that.
the
prosecution
can
show
on
five
previous
occasions
this
person
beat
the
child
so
severely
the
child
almost
died.
then
the
sixth
time
the
child
is
brought
in,
the
same
kind
of
thing,
and
the
child
dies.
does
the
constitution
require
that
this
evidence
of
the
prior
behavior
by
this
defendant
be
excluded?
why
does
the
constitution
require
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
it's
not
relevant
enough,
is
that
it?
the
proof
of
the
prior...
the
proof
of
the
prior
is...
behavior
is
not
sufficient.
is
that
your
objection?
you
needed
more
proof
of
the
prior,
of
the
prior
character?
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
did
make
that
tie.
unknown
speaker
i'm
frankly
surprised
at
your
answer.
i
thought
you
would
have
told
justice
scalia
no,
this
can't
be
introduced.
it's
too
probative.
it's
too
prejudicial.
we
don't
allow
that
in
any
state.
but
you
seem
now
to
be
abandoning
that
and
saying,
oh,
well,
if
it's
not
tied
to
the
defendant...
that
wasn't
his
question.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
not
bringing
it
in
to
prove
the
battered
child
syndrome.
i'm
bringing
it
in
to
prove
that
this
is
the
person
who
battered
the
child...
not
that
the...
just
that
the
child
was
battered
by
somebody,
intentionally.
but
that
this
was
the
person
who
battered
the
child
intentionally.
because
this
person
did
it
five
times
before,
admittedly
did
it
five
times
before.
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
this
was
the
sixth
time.
he
is
a
person
of
that
character.
he's
done
it
five
times
before.
we
think
he
did
it
the
sixth
time.
now,
as
i...
it's
my
impression,
although
you
seem
to
contradict
it...
that
most
states
and
the
federal
courts
would
not
allow
it
to
be
used
for
that
purpose.
and
maybe
that's
good,
but
i
don't
know
that
the
constitution
requires
that
those
states
take
that
position.
and
i
would
like
you
to
tel
me
why
the
constitution
requires
it.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
the
evidence
here
was
simply
not
relevant
enough?
unknown
speaker
that
just
being
one
of
two
people,
in
prior
custody
of
the
child
does
not
sufficiently
tie
it
to
this
defendant
to
enable
it
to
be
admitted,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
unknown
speaker
if
the
evidence
were
that
no
one
else
had
ever
had
custody
of
the
child
except
the
defendant,
would
that
satisfy
your
requirement?
unknown
speaker
if
the
evidence
were
that
no
one
else
in
the
child's
life
had
ever
touched
the
child
except
the
defendant,
that
would
not
suffice
to...
for...
for
your
similars
analysis?
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
have
five
cases
of
a
broken
wrist,
and
this
is
a
case
of
a
broken
rib,
that
would
be
the
objection
that
you
are
now
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
the
dissimilarity
of
the
acts
in
this
hypo
that
raise
the
error,
as
you
put
it,
to
the
constitutional
dimension.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
evidence
that
he
was
one
of
two
customary
custodians.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
much
more
did
they
need?
i
mean,
i...
of
course
there
was
some
evidence.
there
was
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
he
was
one
of
two
customary
custodians.
what
more,
do
you
say,
would
constitutionally
be
required
for
its
admissibility?
unknown
speaker
the
jury
was
instructed
not
to
use
it
for
character
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
without
the...
your
claimed
error
in
instructions,
that
there
would
have
been
a
denial
of
due
process?
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
so,
because
there
was
no
defense
of
accident.
and
so
the...
and
that
the
evidence
only
rebutted
the
lack
of
accident,
only
showed
the
lack
of
accident.
and
the
court
said
that
we
must...
so
that
the
probative
value
of
the
evidence
was
negligible,
and
its
prejudicial
nature
very
high.
and
so
they
had
to
draw
a
balance.
and
that
the
prejudice
outweighed
the
probative
value,
and
therefore
a
denial
of
due
process.
is
that...
do
you
defend
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
relevant
evidence,
admissible
relevant
evidence,
but
as
it
turned
out,
it
was...
its
probative
value
was
negligible
and
its
prejudicial
impact
great.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
the
court...
the
eighth
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
it
had
some
limited
probative
value.
unknown
speaker
pardon...
i
think
i
can
rephrase
what
justice
white
asked
you.
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
here,
was
that
the
evidence
need
not
have
been
admitted
because
the
defendant
did
not
raise
accident
as
a
defense.
i
gather
they
thought
maybe
a
defendant
filed
an
answer
to
an
information
or
indictment
in
california.
do
you
subscribe
to
that
view?
unknown
speaker
i
meant
as
a
principle
of
constitutional
law.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
voris,
can
i
a
question
that...
do
you
know
if
on
the
appeal
in
the
state
court,
there
was
an
error
asserted
with
regard
to
the
instruction?
i
know
the
evidence
question
was
preserved,
but
was
the
instruction
error
preserved?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was...
i
say
it
was
raised,
even
though
not
discussed
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--this
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
california?
unknown
speaker
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
conviction
of
mark
mcguire
was
based
on
unlawful
evidence
and
was
coupled
with
a
prejudicial
instruction,
which
denied
him
due
process.
thank
you.
