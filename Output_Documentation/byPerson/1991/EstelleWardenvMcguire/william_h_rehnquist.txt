v.
mark

mcguire.
mr.
gillette.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
voris.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
90-1074
estelle
against
mcguire.
in
this
case
respondent,
mark
mcguire
and
his
wife
arrived
at
a
hospital
in
california
with
their
six-month-old
daughter.
the
child
suffered
from
numerous
bruises
and
internal
injuries,
was
bluish
in
color,
and
was
not
breathing.
in
spite
of
efforts
to
revive,
the
child
died
45
minutes
later.
mcguire
was
charged
with
a
second
degree
murder
of
the
infant.
at
trial,
the
prosecution
introduced
evidence
that
the
child
had
been
a
victim
of
abuse.
in
particular,
the
battered
child
testimony
revealed
evidence
of
rectal
tearing
which
was
at
least
six
weeks
old
and
evidence
of
partially
healed
rib
fractures
which
were
approximately
seven
weeks
old.
the
prosecution
also
introduced
evidence
that
mcguire's
wife
had
previously
voiced
her
fear
of
mcguire's
dangerous
nature
and
that
she
had
expressed
skepticism
at
mcguire's
explanation
for
the
infant's
death.
the
jury
convicted
mcguire
of
second
degree
murder.
the
california
state
courts
affirmed
the
conviction
holding
that
the
evidence
of
prior
injuries
was
properly
admitted
under
state
law
to
establish
what
is
called
the
battered
child
syndrome.
mcguire
then
sought
federal
habeas
relief
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
his
conviction.
it
ruled
that
the
prior
injury
evidence
was
erroneously
admitted
to
establish
the
battered
child
syndrome
and
that
the
trial
court's
jury
instruction
on
the
use
of
prior
act
evidence
allowed
a
finding
of
guilt
based
simply
on
the
judgment
that
mcguire
had
done
bad
things
in
the
past.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
hold
that
state
law
errors
are
not
a
basis
for
federal
habeas
relief,
and
conclude
that
neither
the
introduction
of
the
challenged
evidence
nor
the
jury
instructions
as
to
its
use
deprive
mcguire
of
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
