mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
pleading
stance,
as
it
involves
the
affirmance
by
the
fifth
circuit
of
a
rule
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss.
that
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
in
direct
conflict
with
one
of
the
eight
circuit
in
the
ruge
case.
in
the
complaint,
which
must
be
taken...
the
allegations
of
which
are
taken
as
true,
plaintiff
alleges
that
the
defendant
city
employed
her
decedent,
that
it
caused
his
death
in
violation
of
due
process
by
sending
him
into
the
sewer
where
he
succumbed,
knowing
that
there
was
a
high
risk
of
death
as
a
result
of
a
prior
incident
that
occurred
several
months
before
he
went
into
the
sewer
and
indeed
before
he
was
employed
and
pursuant
to
a
policy
or
custom
of
deliberate
indifference
to
his
safety
needs
and
the
risks
to
his
life,
as
evidenced
by
its
failure
to
comply
even
with
the
mandates
of
the
texas
hazard
communication
act
and
thereby,
failed
to
train,
warn,
properly
equip
or
supervise
him
in
relation
to
the
risks.
the
allegations
are
read
as
claiming
a
violation
directly
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also
a
violation
of
due
process
as
a
result
of
violations
of
the
substantive
mandates
of
the
texas
hazard
communication
act.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
taking
of
his
life
in
essence,
your
honor,
in
disregard
of
his
bodily
security.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
specifically
states
that
life
shall
not
be
taken
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
only
hearing
that
would
have
solved
the
due
process
problem
would
have
been
training,
warning,
and
supervision,
not
a
hearing,
shall
you
go
down
in
and
succumb.
if
one
wanted
to
analyze
the
case
on
procedural
grounds,
arguably,
that
could
stand
as
a
hearing,
but
i
think
not.
this
is
basically
a
substantive
due
process
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
in
terms
of
his
life
having
been
lost?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
closest,
excuse
me,
would
be
harris
and
city
of
canton,
even
though
it
involved
not
a
public
employee,
of
course,
but
it
did
involve
the
deliberate
indifference
of
a
municipality.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
a
failure
to
train.
or,
as
i
believe
justice
o'connor
described
it
as
an
inaction
in
the
fact
of
a
known
and
patent--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
why,
your
honor,
in
all
of
the
briefing
we
have
taken
the
position
that
not
only
do
you
have
to
prove
your
section
1983
claim
against
the
municipality
by
meeting
the
standard
of
deliberate
indifference,
but
in
order
to
establish
the
violation
of
the
due
process
right
itself,
you
have
to
meet
a
standard
of
deliberate
indifference.
for
example,
your
honor,
in
the
daniels,
davidson,
and
whitley
cases,
the
court
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard
for
harms
to
individuals
who
were
either
pre-trial
detainees
or
people
whose
liberty
was
unconstrained
with
respect
to
due
process
violations
of
the
type
that
might
have
been
involved
in
those
cases.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
there
have
been
a
number
of
such
cases.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
not
to
my
recollection.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
raises
an
interesting
point
that
goes
in
a
way
to
the
heart
of
the
duality
that's
here.
as
to
the
officer,
the
case
would
be
analyzed
as
a
fourth
amendment
proposition
under
graham
and
brower
because
any
excessive
force
case
is
so
analyzed.
it
is
not
analyzed
as
a--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--a
due
process
proposition.
as
to
the
municipality,
since...
or
to
the
entity
that
employs
the
officer,
you
would
still
under
canton
and
city
of
harris...
excuse
me,
city
of
canton
and
harris
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
municipality's
pattern...
customer
policy
was
deliberately
indifferent
and
caused
the
officer
to
engage
in
the
unreasonable
act
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
correct,
and
that
gets
to...
past
the
section
1983
initial
pleading
obligation,
which
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
involves
only
two
elements:
that
a
federal
right
has
been
invaded
under
the
color
of
state
law.
so
far
as
the
municipality
under
monell,
in
order
to
get
that
person
as
a
defendant,
you
have
to
also
demonstrate
deliberate
indifference.
the
ninth...
the
fifth
circuit's
error
in
this
case
was
that
it
didn't
recognize
that
so
far
as
section
1983
was
concerned
we
had
pled
all
the
elements,
do
you
have
to
get
down
right
away
to
a
determination
of
whether
there
has
been
a
federal
right
that's
been
invaded.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
teachings
of
this
court's
decisions,
where
there
is
a
claim
of
substantive
due
process
invasion
of
one's
life
interest
or
bodily
security
interest,
that
deliberate
indifference
is
the
standard
that
defines
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
can
borrow
that
from
the
estelle
line
of
cases
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
we
are
not.
arguably
we
could
stand
here
and
say
that
demonstrating
that
the
municipality
had
caused
this
violation
through
deliberate
indifference
is
sufficient
and
all
we
need
to
do
then
is
demonstrate
some
level
of
recklessness
or
gross
negligence,
as
was
left
free,
at
least
for
argument,
in
daniels,
davidson,
and
whitley.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
way
that
differs
is
we
analyzed
deshaney
as
essentially
a
state
action
causation
case.
in
deshaney,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
analysis
was
that
there
essentially
was
an
intervening
private
cause
for
which
the
state
was
not
responsible,
and
there
was
no
state
action.
in
other
words,
the
chain
of
causation
had
been
broken.
no
such
thing
exists
in
this
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
i
know
not
where
they
get
that
as
an
element
of
a
section
1983
claim.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
the
content
is--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit
law,
which
involves
four...
five
cases
in
which
they
have
used
that
phrase,
i
don't
think
it
is
possible
to
make
that
assertion
within
the
context
of
an
employment
relationship
for
an
injury
that
occurs
on
the
job.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
argued,
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
fifth
circuit,
as
its
opinion
reflects,
that
the
analysis
presented
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
ruge
decision
is
the
correct
analysis,
which
tracks
just
what
your
honor
said,
that
it's
not
the
employment
and
the
injury
in
employment,
but
by
putting
somebody
untrained
in
a
position
of
high
risk
known
to
the
municipality
and
so
far
as
these
pleadings
are
concerned,
we
may
infer,
not
known
to
decedent,
that
is
the
violation
of
constitutional
right.
we
stand
on
the
eighth
circuit
analysis.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
think,
if
you
are
speaking
of
the
state
as
opposed
to
an
individual
flesh-and-blood
state
actor,
i
know
of
no
such
case,
so
far
as--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
the
same,
and
that
is
why
we
have
gone
for
the
standard
in
this
context
of
deliberate
indifference,
which
under
wilson
is
an
intense
standard.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what
we...
our
position
is
that
the
city's
failure
to
train
is
the
intentional
action,
just
as
in
lafleur
the--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--but
intent
has
two
components.
there's
the
standard
that's
articulated
in
wilson,
albeit
in
an
eighth
amendment
context,
in
which
your
honor
described
it,
and
as
i
analyze
it,
as
what
is
known
as
objective
intent.
and
then
there
is
a
standard,
i
think
in
whitley
and
albers
which
one
would
analyze
as
subjective
intent.
we
suggest
that
you
do
not
need
to
prove
the
objective
intent
to
make
out
the
due
process
violation,
and
we
have
adequately
pled
the
objective
intent
standard.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
think
that
perhaps
in
lafleur,
for
example,
the
pregnancy
leave
case,
surely
someone
performed
an
intentional
act
of
saying
you
must
go
on
leave,
but
there
was
no
intent
to
violate
a
right
as
such.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
it
was
analyzed,
as
i
recall,
an
arbitrary
and
capriciousness
standard
basis
as
opposed
to
equal
protection
bases.
and
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
at
those
levels,
the
equal
protection
analysis
is
really
a
subset
of
a
fundamental
substantive
due
process--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--no,
i
think
not.
it
is
contextual,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
first...
well,
that's
not
gross
negligence.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
an
intent...
that's
an
intent,
as
i
read
the
cases,
albeit
in
the
fighth
amendment
context.
that
equates
to
intent.
now,
fallback--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--that
uses
deliberate
indifference?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
has
been
reserved,
your
honor.
the
closest
is
the
whitley
and
albers
case
in
which
the
subjective
intent
standard
was
applied,
and
the
issue
was
reserved
as
to
people
who
were
either
pre-trial
detainees
or
people
whose
liberty
was
not
constrained.
we
submit
that
it
is
contextual
in
the
sense
of
the
government
need,
the
interest
of
the
individual,
and
where
the
acts
are
taking
place.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
not,
your
honor,
under
the...
as
i
understand
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
which
is
not
before
us,
it
basically
precludes
bivens
actions
for
actions
that
are
taken
properly
within
the
scope
of
employment.
so
the
issue
never
gets
to
the
courts,
except
on
the
basis
of
a
proper
certification
of
whether
the
action
was
taken
within
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
you
are
talking
about
the
federal
government,
i
understand
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
this
court's
decisions
take
care
of
that.
if
you
are
talking
about
the
state--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
understand
that
if
there
is
a
certification
that
the
action
occurred
within
the
course
of...
within
the
course
of
employment--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--well,
then
the
government
is
out,
but
the
individual
actor
under
a
bivens
action
sued
in
his
or
her
personal
capacity
presumably
would
have
to
stand
in
answer
if
a
claim
of
deliberate
indifference
is
made.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
proven,
and
proving
it,
of
course,
is
extremely
difficult.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
runs
over
you
while
he
is
driving
the
postal
truck?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that...
that's
a
one
tough
one,
your
honor.
i
know
those
hypotheticals
are
used
in
the
negligence
cases,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
you've
have
identified
that
negligence
can
never
be
the
standard
for
making
out
a
due
process
violation
involving
injury
to
person,
property
or
life.
and
we
do
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
question
of
identifying
the
appropriate
standard
that
is
the
task
of
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
your
honor,
that
would
involve
a
modification
of
what
appears
to
be
the
rule
in
zinermon
v.
burch.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but
obviously
the
court
is
free
to
make
that
modification.
i
don't
know
however
why
there
should
be
a
differentiation
between
substantive
due
process
rights
against
arbitrary
or
capricious
government
action
and
first
amendment
rights
or
equal
protection
rights
or
other--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
think
not--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
agree.
that
wasn't
the
intent
of
congress,
but
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
reenact
the
constitution
in
terms
of
its
liberty
components
through
the
enactment
of
section
1983,
and
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
section
1983
should
be
a
broad
remedial
statute.
it
is
appropriate
to
differentiate
with
respect
to
the
standards
within
one
bundle
of
rights,
substantive
as
opposed
to
procedural,
as
to
what
standard
will
be
applied--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--well,
as
i
say,
it
would
require
a
revision
of
the
statement
in
zinermon
v.
roth
to
say
that,
but
we
don't
agree
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
turn
section
1983
into
a
general
tort
statute.
as--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
is...
it
is
conceivable
that
such
a
case
could
be--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--no,
it
does
not,
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
limit
it
to
death
as
opposed
to
physical
or
emotional
injury--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--as
pled
and
presented
below,
that
is
essentially
correct
except
with
respect,
at
some
levels,
to
the
claim
under
the
texas
hazard
communication
act,
but
it
has
not
been
briefed
very
fully
to
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
would
be
one
thing.
if
one
had
to
fall
back
under
that
statute,
we
believe
that
the
respondent
has
demonstrated
the
inadequacy
of
the
remedy
available
with
respect
to
these
claims,
by
demonstrating,
for
example,
that
under
the
texas
tort
claims
act,
if
a
private
employee
were
killed,
an
action
could
be
brought
for
gross
negligence
and
exemplary
damages,
but
because
of
the
immunity
statutes--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--well,
it
certainly
renders
suspect
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
under
the
texas
hazard
communication
act.
but
this
case
has
been
analyzed
and
presented,
principally
as
a
substantive
due
process
case.
no
question
about
it.
and
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
has
reached
the
proportions
of
this
case.
there
are
several
circuit
court
decisions
that
we
believe
are
instructive.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
there
is--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--and
we
submit
that
that
is
whitley
and
albers,
does
suggest
that--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
your
honor.
in
the
decision,
i
believe,
the
court
also
addressed
the
due...
substantive
due
process
claim
and
held
it
to
the
same
standard
as
the
eighth
amendment
standard.
so
that
would
be
the
only
case
that
appears
to
be
more
or
less
directly
on
point,
albeit
in
the
context
of--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--the
implications
of
both
daniels
and
davidson--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--that
is
true.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
they
were
addressed
as
procedural
due
process
claims.
i
frankly
don't
know
why.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
do
recall
that,
but
i
meant
there
were
concessions
along
the
way
by
counsel.
it
was
analyzed
specifically
as
procedural.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
you
might,
but
not
against
the
government.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
it
would
have
to
be
against
the
officer
in
his
individual
capacity.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
think
so--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--your
life.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
and
if
the
standard--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
would
be
everything
turns
into
a
constitutional
thing
if
you
were
talking
about
negligence
or
a
failure
to
apply
a
proper
duty
of
care
or
standard...
ordinary
standard
of
care.
we're
talking
about
intent.
at
the
very
least,
we're
talking
about
deliberate
indifference,
which
is
objective
intent.
and
why
shouldn't
the
populace
be
protected
from
the
government
if
it
really
goes
about
on
that
level
of
willfulness,
taking
people's
lives
or
injuring
them
egregiously
or
taking
their
property?
we
believe
that
that
was
the
purpose
in
the
enactment
of
the
constitution
and
certainly
in
section
1983.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
believe
they
did--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--yes,
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
coyne
case,
if
i
recall,
in
the
debates.
there
was
some
discussion
of
substantive
due
process,
natural
law
kinds
of
cases,
in
some
of
those
debates,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection...
not
clearly
in
mind.
i
have
admitted
already
and
i
think
the
record
is
clear,
the
historic
record,
that
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
debate
on
section
1
of
that
civil
rights
act,
that
the
focus
was
on
the
criminal
provisions
and
the
conspiracy
provision.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
not.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
it
may
have
been...
were
there
things
in
barron
and
baltimore
and
there
were
circuit
decisions
by
justice
washington
and
such
that
dealt
with
very
much
related
concepts
under
the
fourth...
article
iv,
equal
protection
or
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
but
i
see--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--the
only
state
litigation...
there
is
no
private
claim
that
could
be
brought
in
state
court.
the
attorney
general
of
texas
did
bring
an
enforcement
action,
a
civil
action
under
the
texas
hazard
communication
act
which
the
court
has
agreed
to
take
judicial
notice
just
on
the
subject
of
the
applicability
to
these
circumstances--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
beg
your
pardon.
there
were.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
as
a
matter
of
state,
but--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--not
punitive
damages,
not
general
damages.
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
a
private...
an
employee
of
a
private
entity
would
have
those
claims.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
for
gross
negligence,
but
not
against
the
municipality,
which
is
immune
where
there
is
a
death.
thank
you,
your
honors.
may
i
reserve
my
remaining
time?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
thank
you,
your
honor.
respondent
has
now
thrown
itself
in
conflict
with
every
circuit
court
in
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
range
of
hypotheticals.
for
example,
in
mcclary,
that
court
in
footnote
6
allowed
for
an
intentional
injury
to
the
life
or
security
interest.
the
ninth
circuit
had
a
case,
if
i
recall,
not
too
long
ago
in
which
the
police
systematically
hassled
a
bar
owner.
for
no
particular
reason,
they
didn't
like
him.
that
gave
rise
to
a
substantive
violation
of
the
constitution.
similarly,
the
cornelius
case
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
which
the
town
clerk
got
kidnapped.
that
gave
rise
to
a
substantive
security
violation.
mr.
justice
thomas,
there
is
one...
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
believe
so.
mr.
justice
thomas--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--i
believe
so
on
this
abuse
of
power
concept.
mr.
justice
thomas,
there
is
a
case
that
tracks
your
hypothetical,
fruit
v.
norris
cited
in
the
aclu
amicus
brief.
a
prisoner
was
ordered
into
a
sewer,
refused
to
go.
of
course,
he
was
in
custody.
he
wasn't
killed.
he
wasn't
whipped.
he
was
disciplined,
just
as
an
employee
who
might
have
refused
to
go
into
the
sewer
might
have
been
disciplined.
we
really
have
seen
no
analytical
difference
based
upon
custody.
the
real
key,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
the
standard...
that
is,
the
finger
in
the
dike.
