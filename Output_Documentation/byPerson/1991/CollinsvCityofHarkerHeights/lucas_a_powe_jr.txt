mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
what
this
case
lacks
is
a
constitutional
violation.
petitioner
attempts
to
create
one
by
stringing
epithets
at
the
city's
conduct
in
a
worker's
compensation
case.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
if
there
is
injury
on
one
hand
and
a
bad
enough
governmental
entity
on
the
other,
and
causation
between
the
two,
there
is
a
constitutional
violation.
this
has
never
been
the
law;
this
ought
not
be
the
law,
because
if
it
is,
it
is
going
to
turn
a
tremendous
amount
of
litigation
into
federal
constitutional
law.
let
me
offer
a
hypothetical
which
i
believe
will
help
flesh
out
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
contours
of
what's
available.
the
police
department
of
harker
heights
is
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
maintenance
of
its
cars,
just
doesn't
care
about
them.
police
go
out;
they
arrest
a
suspect.
driving
the
suspect
back,
the
steering
wheel
jams,
the
police
officer
and
the
suspect
are
both
killed.
in
our
mind
the
suspect
has
a
1983
action.
the
police
officer
does
not
have
1983
action.
the
reason
for
the
distinction
between
these
two
people
is
custody.
when
this
court
has
dealt
with
section
1983
claims
in
a
substantive
due
process
fashion,
the
key
element
is
custody.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
justice
white,
a
person
as
jeraldine
harris
in
city
of
canton
v.
harris
wasn't
free
to
make
her
own
choices
under
those
facts.
if
she
wanted
to
leave
the
police
station,
presumably
the
officers
would
have
prevented
it.
custody
is
a
basic
fact
where
an
individual
in
our
society
loses
the
liberty
of
choice,
and
the
due
process
clause
is
about
the--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--that
is
not
true,
justice
stevens.
the...
i
am
not
saying
that
the
consequences
of
failure
to
drive
the
car
are
de
minimis
but
the
sergeant
has
the
opportunity
under
our
society
to
say,
i
won't
drive
the
car.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
would
like
to
concede
that
arguendo
for
purposes
of
this
case
only.
it
is
clear
to
me
that--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
decision
in
city
of
canton
v.
harris
at
least
suggested
that
there
would
be
that,
and
i
don't
mean
to
argue
the
suspect's
constitutional
rights
before
this
court.
i
wish
to
argue
the
city's
constitutional
rights,
and
it
is
my
contention
that--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--by
the
suspect?
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i'd
like
to
concede
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--my
opinion
is
that
the
government
does
in
fact
owe
some
duties
that
are
sufficient
to
get
past
a
12(b)(6)
motion
under
this,
that
facts
would
be
necessary--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--my
instinct
is
that
when
the
police
takes--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--my
legal
opinion
is
that
when
the
police
take
someone
off
the
street,
that
they
owe
a
duty
of
reasonable
care
to
that.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
true.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
third
line.
i
was
ready
in
my
hypothetical
to
kill
a
pedestrian
if
necessary.
[laughter]
although
i
would
like
to
minimize
the
number
of
deaths
in
one
argument.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
the
point
that
i
have
in
my
argument
is
that
the
police
officer
who
was
driving
the
car
may
only
prevail
in
a
1983
action
if
this
court
holds
that
there
is
a
duty
of
workplace
safety
that
the
city
must
provide.
and
this
court's
cases
don't...
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
this
court's
constitutional
cases
that
a
municipality
has
a
duty
of
workplace
safety.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
simply
don't
believe
in
our
society
that
that
can
be
an
accurate
description.
ms.
harris
has
no
choices
whatsoever
once
the
police
bring
force
to
bear
upon
her.
but
my
police
officer,
unless
this
court
is
going
to
repeal
the
thirteenth
amendment,
may
always
quit
his
job.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
that's
quite
true.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
that's
quite
true
because
this
court
has
found
that
the
constitution
applies
in
the
workplace--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--with
the
first
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
specific--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--that's
quite
correct.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
hoped
i
got
that
out;
i
meant
to.
there
is
a
reason
why
this
court
has
held.
first,
the
very
fact
that
a
provision
has
been
placed
specifically
in
the
constitution
is
a
demonstration
by
those
involved
that
they
believed
the
government
was
more
likely
to
violate
that
provision
and
its
violation
was
more
harmful.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
well,
the
case
that
you
were
asking
mr.
rosen
for
is
dred
scott
v.
sanford.
that's
the
only
substantive
due
process
case
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct,
justice
white,
of
course.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference
whatsoever.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
no
liability...
it
is
wrong.
let
me
make
it
clear.
it's
wrong.
the
facts
that
you
give
might
be
enough
for
an
indictment,
and
i'm
not
a
criminal
law
expert
but
some
form--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--no,
no.
it
is
not.
i
think
it
is
tortious,
there
is
a
state
system
that
is
fully
functioning
that
is
able
to
deal
with
tortious
conduct.
there
is
an
assumption
that
seems
to
pervade--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--no,
not
really.
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
caught
in
its
standard
between
this
court's
decisions
in
parratt
v.
taylor
and
daniels
v.
williams,
and
it
was
doing
the
best
it
could.
i
think
if
it
had
thought
further
about
what
it
was
dealing
with,
it
would
have
understood
the
discussions
of
abuse
of
power
occur
in
the
context
of
custody
with
the
police--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
believe
reading
justice
white's
opinion
in
city
of
canton
v.
harris--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--excuse
me,
justice
white.
that
the
decision
to
restrain
liberty,
to
prevent
a
person--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
will
agree
with
that.
i
think
of...
i
have
been
thinking
of--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
know
how
it
works,
but
i
just
don't
believe
that
it's
accurate.
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
discuss
in
our
country
the
idea
that
work
is
a
custodial
environment.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
contrary
to
all
our
notions.
it
is
true
that
for
some
people
the
economic
system
imposes
more
constraints
than
on
others,
but
i
think
that
that's
much
like
the
problem
in
deshaney
v.
winnebago
county,
that
some
children
have
the
misfortune
of
being
born
to
bad
fathers.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
if
i
understood,
the
reason
i
am
drawing
the
line
at
custody
is
that
if
there
is
not
custody
a
state
does
not
violate
due
process
of
law
with
respect
to
the
people
it
deals
with.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
what
flows
from
this
court's
cases.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
no,
it...
we
don't
have--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
substantive
due
process--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--well,
there
are...
i
think
within
that
there's
still
some
ambiguity
because
at
various
times
this
court
has
held
that
substantive
due
process
can
give
meaning
to
an
idea
as
if
it
were
functionally
equivalent
to
a
specific
guarantee
of
the
constitution.
at
one
time,
liberty
of
contract
under
lochner
was
such
a
right.
the
right
of
privacy
under
griswold
appears
to
be
such
a
right;
the
right
of
travel.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
the
state
can't
interfere
with
a
guaranteed
constitutional
right
under
any
circumstance.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true,
justice
stevens,
but
it
is
one
of
those
very
few
examples
where
this
court
has
interpreted
substantive
due
process
as
if
there
were
specific
words
beyond
due
process:
right
of
privacy.
there
is
no
case
that
does
it
with
workplace
safety.
this
case...
court
has
avoided
finding
a
fundamental
right
to
food,
to
clothing,
to
shelter,
to
education,
to
employment--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--as
though
it
were.
substantive
due
process,
as
you--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
think...
functionally,
this
court
has
developed
these
categories
where
there
are
the
specific
guarantees
in
the
constitution.
there
are
some
aspects
of
substantive
due
process
which
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
specific
guarantees
in
the
constitution.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fair
reading--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--yes.
if
i
could
state
that
work
place
safety,
to
use
palko,
is
simply...
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty.
it's
important,
but
it's
not
the
same
rank
order.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
i
think
that
government
is
more
likely
to
infringe
on
the
safety
of
its
employees
than
private
employers.
there's
no
more
reason
to
believe
that
a
government
infringement
here
would
be
more
harmful
to
the
people
involved
than
if
it
happened
with
private
employers.
indeed,
one
facet
of
government
in
the
workplace
is
that
governmental
policies
may
be
changed.
governments
are
not
as
driven
as
private
corporations
by
the
bottom
line.
we
can
change
governmental
policies
through
democratic
processes,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
applicable
to
these
cases.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
that...
i
believe
the
city--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
believe
the
city
owes
a
higher
duty
to
those
who
are
forced
by
the
force
of
law,
forced
into
what
they
are
doing
than
those
who
do
so
voluntarily
in
employment.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
think
the
underlying
constitutional
right
is
the
facet
of
due
process
of
law
that
ties
into
coercion.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
grant
that
it...
or
i
grant
the
problem
that
you
are
giving
me
with
the
hypothetical.
i
do
not
pretend
that
coercion
is
a
perfect
bright-line
rule
that
one
can
see
both
sides
of
it
at
all
times.
there
will
be
some
blurry
situations
involving
custody
coercion.
i
don't
dispute
that.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
if
the
workplace
is
custodial
or
coercive,
then
i
think
everything
is.
and
i
think
that
it's
important
to
realize
that
workplace
safety
is
very,
very
far
to
one
side
of
the
line
that
i'm
drawing.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
only
a
federal
judicial
forum
can
provide
the
needed
remedy
for
her
and
that
this
court
should
eschew
bright-line
rules
in
formulating
what
should
happen.
as
petitioner
words
it,
all
she
is
asking
for
is
an
opportunity
to
go
to
federal
court
under
certain
very
limited
circumstances.
the
participation
of
the
amici
seem
to...
in
this
case
seem
to
me
to
belie
that.
i
think
there
is
an
understanding
of
the
various
amici
that
have
filed
briefs
in
this
case
that
something
big
is
at
stake
in
the
amount
of
litigation
that
can
occur.
if
i...
if
the
city
of
harker
heights
has
sent
three
individuals
down
that
manhole
that
day...
one,
mr.
collins
had
died,
another
had
been
seriously
injured,
and
the
third,
while
getting
out
had
broken
his
wristwatch,
this
court
would
be
faced
with
three
1983
cases
today,
one
involving
life;
one
involving
liberty,
bodily
security;
and
one
involving
property.
the
point
of
this
is
that
it's
not
sewers.
it's
schools,
it's
hospitals,
it's
everywhere
that
government
is,
because
petitioner's
argument
is
that
if
the
government
is
bad
enough
and
there
is
injury,
then
there
is
going
to
be
a
1983
claim.
petitioner
states
that
when
i
articulate
this,
that
i
am
making
a
floodgates
argument.
i
think
that
my
argument
is
both
constitutional
law
and
it
is
a
floodgates
argument,
because
i
find
nothing
in
petitioner's
argument
that
would
close
the
floodgates.
i
don't
even
find
a
finger
in
the
dike
under
these
circumstances.
what
petitioner
i
think
overlooks
consistently
is
the
point
of
states
and
the
creativity
within
our
federal
system.
the
states
for
the
last
20
years
have
been
amazingly
active
in
tort
reform.
under
some
circumstances
the
states
have
expanded
liability.
in
a
couple
of
areas
they
have
contracted
liability.
torts
is
an
area
that
the
state
courts
deal
with,
and
the
legislatures
deal
with.
texas,
in
fact,
has
dealt
with
the
problem
that
we
are
discussing
today
in
two
separate
fashions.
in
one
fashion
there
is
the
texas
worker's
compensation
act.
petitioner
is
receiving
a
worker's
compensation
award
under
the
texas
statute.
in
the
other
hand,
there
is
the
texas
hazard
communication
act.
i...
in
petitioner's
brief,
as
i
understood
the
brief,
and
i
did
not
hear
this
in
the
oral
argument,
petitioner
was
trying
to
state
that
the
texas
hazard
communication
act
created
some
form
of
constitutional
expectation
that
would
then
be
protected
by
due
process.
it
was
as
if
texas
had
created
this
right
on
one
hand
and
then
inadvertently
failed
to
provide
a
good
enough
remedy
for
the
constitutional
right
that
texas
had
created.
i
believe
that
petitioner's
argument
in
her
brief
about
the
texas
hazard
communication
act
borders
on
unconstitutional.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
texas
legislature
is
free
to
pass
whatever
statutes
it
pleases.
it
is
perfectly
free
to
remedy
those
statutes
in
any
way
that
it
pleases,
and
if
texas
did
not
adequately
provide
a
good
enough
remedy
under
the
texas
hazard
communication
act,
that
the
forum
for
discussion
of
that
is
either
in
austin,
texas,
or
across
the
street
at
the
congress.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
am
not
sure--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--no,
it's
not.
you
are
quite
correct.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
police
and
their
ability
to
use
force,
and
use
force
without
fear,
i
think,
of
violence
coming
back
at
them,
at
least
in
your
crowd
example--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--justice
white,
when
a
police
officer
tells
me
to
move
along,
i
view
that
as
a
very
good
idea.
i
think
that
that
is
a
statement
that
is
backed
up
by
the
power
of
the
state
and--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i'm
sure
that--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--yes.
that
is
arguendo.
i
was
about
to
say,
i
am
sure
petitioner
would
agree
with
that.
in
daniels
v.--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--no,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
me.
i
think
that
whatever
standard
of
fault
that
can
be
required,
it
can
be
pled.
and
my
point
is
that
without
a
custodial
setting,
there
simply
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
under
due
process
of
law.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
that
is
correct,
under
some
circumstances.
substantive
due
process
takes
its
position
from
context.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
substantive
due
process
is
the
most
difficult
concept
in
constitutional
law,
and
i
think
you
understand
it
as
well
as
or
better--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
that's
an
excellent
statement.
in
daniels
v.
williams,
this
court
noted
that
the
only
thing
governmental
about
the
action
was
the
fact
that
the
respondent
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
the
petitioner
was
an
inmate
in
his
custody.
at
least
there
was
custody
there.
in
the
instant
case,
the
only
thing
that
separates
this
case
from
an
ordinary
tort
is
the
fact
that
the
respondent
happens
to
be
a
governmental
entity.
otherwise,
this
case
presents
a
tort
case.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
this
case
would
be
found
in
torts
class,
tort
as
a
personal
injury
problem.
i
don't
believe
that
deliberate
indifference
covers
a
constitutional
case.
i
don't
believe
that
joshua
deshaney
could
succeed
on
the
facts
of
that
case
if
the
case
went
back
and
were
repleaded
as
a
deliberate
indifference
case.
i
don't
think
deliberate
indifference
is
a
facet
of
the
constitution
under
these
circumstances.
it
came
about
as
a
way
in
this
context
of
ascribing
liability
to
a
city
for
a
constitutional
violation
that
existed.
it
did
not
create
the
constitutional
violation
itself.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
something
more
than
negligence
might
in
the
types
of
settings
where
this
court
has
been
deciding
its
1983
cases.
this
case
marks
a
tremendous
change
in
the
type
of
1983
case
that
has
been
brought.
i
think
that
this
case
is
the
equivalent
of
paul
v.
davis
when...
once
you
had
monroe
v.
pape,
i
think
a
case
like
paul
v.
davis
was
an
inevitable
outgrowth,
and
i
think
that
once
you
have
monell,
a
case
like
collins
v.
city
of
harker
heights
is
the
outgrowth.
but
i
do
think
that
the
fundamental
insight
of
paul
v.
davis
was
that
neither
1983
nor
the
fourteenth
amendment
turned
this
court
into
a
uniform
commission
on
state
tort
law.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
that's
right.
it
is
a
tort
for
which
there
are
state
courts
and
state
remedies
available
to
deal
with.
not
every
injury
committed
by
government
has
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
no,
no,
certainly,
i
didn't
mean
to.
at
page
19--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
think
that
both
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
invidious
discrimination
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause
impose
limits
on
government
in
all
contexts.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
if
the
statement
is
that
a
person
was...
the
state
used
its
selective
power
on
the
basis
of
race
or
on
the
basis
of
political
belief
adversely
to
the
individual,
i
think
those
are--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--yes,
i
certainly
am.
at
page

of
petitioner's
reply
brief
she
states
that
federal
judges
will
know
a
dismissible
1983
case
when
they
see
one.
well
all
four
federal
judges
below
voted
to
dismiss
this
complaint
and
that
is
because
for
all
her
artful
pleading,
all
petitioner
alleges
is
a
tort.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
as
i
stated,
justice
white,
i
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit,
if
they
had
thought
about
the
case
a
little
more
in--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
think
abuse
of
governmental
power
is
inherent
in
the
concept
of
due
process
of
law,
and
that
that...
the
fifth
circuit
was
tagging--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--no,
under
no
circumstances.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
i
think
that
if
the
police
got
an
order
to
throw
the
prisoner
in
my
initial
hypothetical,
an
order
came
from
the
city,
throw
the
prisoner
into
the
river
and
kill
him.
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
that
is
the
line
that
i
believe
the
constitution--
mr.
lucas
a.
powe,
jr.
--i
believe
that
abuse
of
power
is
inherent...
you
know,
it's
part
of
the
custody
and
it
describes
when
a
custodial
setting
is
going
to
raise
to
a
constitutional
violation
and
when
it's
not.
