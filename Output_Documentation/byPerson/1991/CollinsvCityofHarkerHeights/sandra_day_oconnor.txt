there
were
workman's
comp
benefits
available,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
not
punitive
damages?

mr.
powe,
i
suppose
in
one
sense
a
government
employee
has
to
do
what
the
employee
is
told
to
do
by
the
supervisors
or
risk
being
fire,
and
in
that
sense,
may
be
as
much
in
the
control
of
the
government
as
ms.
harris
was
in
the
city
of
canton,
in
a
different
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
powe,
what
if
here
the
city
knew,
clearly
knew
that
sending
this
employee
into
the
sewer
would
result
in
his
death,
but
concluded
that
it
was
going
to
send
him
anyway,
intentionally
sent
him
there
to
his
death?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
we
are
talking
about
whether
it
is
a
substantive
due
process
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
defend
the
court
below
where
it
has
a
turn
on
whether
there
is
an
abuse
of
government
power?
that's
how
i
read
the
court,
as
finding
within
1983
some
element
of
having
to
prove
abuse
of
government
power.
do
you
defend
that?
