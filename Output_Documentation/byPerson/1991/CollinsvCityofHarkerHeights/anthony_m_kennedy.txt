that
was
where
the
woman
was
in
the
custody
of
the
policy
and
slumped
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
she
was
in
custody.
here
it's
a
little
hard
to
say
that
the
employee
is
in
the
custody
of
the
city.
to
be
sure,
he
has
a
supervisor
who
tells
him
where
to
go
and
what
to
do,
but
he's
not
in
a
kind
of
involuntary
custody
that
the
petitioner
was
in
harris.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
if
we
were
to
acknowledge
that,
you
know
our
problem,
obviously,
a
reluctance
to
have
an
undifferentiated,
broad-based
substantive
due
process
right
under
1983.
why
shouldn't
we
just
apply
the
parratt
line
of
cases
to
such
claims,
and
to
say
that
they
apply
in
the
substantive
violation
area
as
well,
when
the
claim
is
undifferentiated,
not
based
on
the
first
or
fourth
amendments
or
a
specific
constitutional
violation?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
would
strike
very
close
to
the
root
of
the
real
harm.
if
there's
no
ability
to
recover
from
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
an
aggravated
factor
that
might
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
there's
1983...
liability
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
it
would.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of
the
obvious
problem
of
your
turning
1983
into
a
general
tort
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
was
probably
not
the
intent
of
the
congress.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
there
is
an
adequate
remedy,
then
that
necessity
is
gone.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
workman's
compensation
in
state
law,
is
there
an
exception
for
serious
and
willful
misconduct
or
something
like
that,
so
that
if
there's
aggravated
conduct
there
can
be
a
suit
under
the
general
tort
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
make
sure
why
you
concede
that
there
is
liability
in
your
hypothetical.
is
it
because
there
is
a
fourth
and
an
eighth
amendment
concern?
this
custody
requirement
that
you
impose,
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
court
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
standard
fourth
amendment
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
hypothetical,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
advance
the
analysis
very
much.
and
i
am
frankly
surprised
you
concede
it,
because
if
you
say
that
if
there
is
custody
as
a
free-floating
substantive
due
process
right
to
be
treated
properly
within
custody,
it's
just
a
slight
extension
to
say
that
this
employee
was
in
the
constructive...
i
mean,
you
know
how
that
works.
