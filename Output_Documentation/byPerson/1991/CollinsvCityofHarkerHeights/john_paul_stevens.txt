justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
is
not
a
substantive
due
process
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
your
theory...
in
this
case
you
have
an
employee
who
is
suing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
theory
would
equally
apply
to
a
civilian
pedestrian
walking
down
the
street
who
fell
into
a
manhole...
said
they'd
left
a
cover
off
a
manhole
and
somebody
fell
into
the
sewer
and
they
were
deliberately
indifferent
in
the
way
they
taught
people
to
put
manholes
back
onto
the
sidewalk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
limiting...
your
category
of
potential
plaintiffs
is
not
limited
to
employees,
by
any
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
physical
injury
and
impairment
of
liberty.
and
your
test,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you,
because
you
are
not
relying
on
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
you
are
claiming
this
is
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
you
are
claiming
that
statute
gave
you
some
kind
of
a
liberty
interest
of
which
you
could
not
be
deprived
without
a
prior
hearing,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
some
kind
of
constitutional
obligation
to
give
employees
of
the
city
precisely
the
same
remedy
that
non-employees
would
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
decision
of
this
court
that
holds
there
is
a
substantive
due
process
violation
by
committing
a
tort,
whether
it's
negligence,
deliberate
or
deliberate
indifference,
is
there,
other
than
substantive
due
process,
in
the
sense
of
picking
up
one
of
the
enumerated
rights
in
the
bill
of
rights...
if
it's
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
an
eight
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
that
an
eight
amendment
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
you
can't
find
a
case
that
wasn't
at
least
an
alterative
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights,
an
alternative
ground--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
were
procedural
due
process
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
majority
didn't
follow
my
separate
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
the
police
sergeant
is
told
by
the
lieutenant,
you
drive
that
car,
you
have
no
choice
in
this
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask--
--challenge
your
custody
that's
sanctioned
with
an
example.
supposing
a
woman
has
been
raped
and
wants
an
abortion,
and
that
everyone
would
agree
in
the
hypothesis
that
she
had
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
an
abortion.
she
is
not
in
custody.
could
the
state
arbitrarily
interfere
with
her
access
to
the
abortion
clinic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
guaranteed
only
in
a
substantive
due
process--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
how
about
travel
then?
supposing
somebody
wanted
to
get
access
to
someplace...
you
would
say
that
that
is
also
one
that's
been
crystallized
as
a...
as
though
it
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
there
three
kinds
of
substantive
due
process
rights:
those
that
are
enumerated,
those
are
just...
might
as
well
have
been
enumerated,
and
then
this
kind
of
noncustodial
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
opponent
disagrees
with
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
right.
he
says
there's
this
higher
standard
of
proof,
the
deliberate
indifference
and
so
forth,
which
is
also
his
thumb
in
the
dike.
that's
why
he
doesn't
think
you
are
opening
the
floodgate.
so
there
is
that.
the
ordinary
negligence
wouldn't
be
enough,
where
it
would
be
in
most
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
and
i
didn't
agree
with
it
myself,
but
the
court
has
said
in
effect
that
negligence
isn't
enough
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation,
which
seems
to
me
to
imply
that
something
more
than
negligence
might.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
to
say
that
they
sent
the
man
into
the
sewer
or
ran
over
the
front
lawn,
because
the
man
was
a
member
of
another
political
party
or
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
wrong
race
or
something
like
that?
you
aren't
going
that
far?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
of
the
two
is
collins
against
the
city
of
harker
heights,
a
case
that
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioner's
husband
was
an
employee
of
the
city
sanitation
department.
he
died
of
asphyxia
after
entering
a
manhole
to
unstop
a
sewer
line.
petitioner
brought
this
action
under
the
civil
rights
act
42
u.s.c.
1983
alleging
that
her
husband
had
a
right
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
and
to
be
protected
from
the
city's
custom
and
policy
of
deliberate
indifference
toward
its
employee's
safety,
and
that
the
city
had
violated
that
right
by
following
a
custom
and
policy
of
not
training
its
employees
about
the
dangers
of
working
in
sewer
lines
and
manholes
not
providing
adequate
safety
equipment
at
job
sites
or
adequate
safety
warnings.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
allege
a
constitutional
violation.
without
reaching
the
question
whether
the
city
had
violated
collins'
constitutional
rights,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
a
different
theory
that
there
had
been
no
abuse
of
governmental
power
which
the
court
found
to
be
a
necessary
element
of
a
civil
rights
action.
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
section
1983
as
requiring
proof
of
an
abusive
governmental
power
separate
and
apart
from
the
proof
of
a
constitutional
violation.
we
nevertheless
affirm
that
court's
judgment
because
we
are
satisfied
that
the
conduct
alleged
in
petitioner's
complaint
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
