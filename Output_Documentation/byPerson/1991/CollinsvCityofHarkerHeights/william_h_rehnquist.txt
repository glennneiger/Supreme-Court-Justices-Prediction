chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-1279,
myra
jo
collins
v.
the
city
of
harker
heights,
texas.
mr.
rosen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
violation
of
the
constitution
claim,
mr.
rosen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
protected
by
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
had
given
him
some
sort
of
a
hearing
before
they
sent
him
into
this
place,
would
that
have
solved
the
due
process
problem?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
deliberate
indifference
you
are
talking
about
here
basically
comes
from
monell's
requirement
that
it
be
a
policy
of
the
municipality
rather
than
an
act
of
the
individual,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
are
really
borrowing
from
the
monell
line
of
cases
a
concept
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitution
and
importing
it
into
constitutional
law,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
claiming
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
your
case
differ
from
deshaney
v.
winnebago
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
analysis,
you
really
don't
need
the
federal
tort
claims
act
to
sue
a
veterans
hospital
or
to
sue
anybody
else
that
works
for
the
government.
you
have
a
bivens
action,
i
presume,
if
you
can
show
the
deliberate
indifference
on
the
part
of
a
government
employee,
a
surgeon
or
a
postman
that
ran
over
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
you
have
a
bivens
claim
against
someone
who,
under
your
theory,
denied...
took
your
life
away
by
deliberate
indifference
to
your
safety
on
the
part
of
the
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
take
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
there
had
never
been
a
federal
tort
claims
act
passed,
and
the
government
just
says
we
have
sovereign
immunity
from
all
of
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
would
be
a
constitutional
violation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
if
i
can
show
that
a
postman
deliberately
runs
over
me,
or
is
consciously
indifferent
to
my
welfare,
i
can
sue
him
under
the
united
states
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
mr.
rosen.
mr.
powe,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
powe.
mr.
rosen,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
