justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
do
you
know...
section
1983
aside,
do
you
know
of
any
case
involving
the
due
process
clause
and
involving
substantive
due
process,
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
or
property,
where
the
deprivation
was
not
intentional,
where
the
state
through
negligence
or
gross
negligence
or
whatever
you
like
has
caused
somebody's
death
and
it's
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
test
for
a
constitutional
violation
under
1983
is
different
from
the
test
under
the
due
process
clause,
simpliciter,
as
we
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
that's
the
standard
for
attributing...
for
attributing
the
violation
to
the
municipality,
but
in
all
of
the
cases
i
am
aware
of
anyway,
the
violation,
at
least
when
you
are
talking
about
a
due
process,
substantive
due
process
violation,
is
an
intentional
violation
on
the
part
of
somebody,
not
that
the
person
died
or
was
deprived
of
something
accidentally
or
even
with
gross
negligence.
at
least
somebody
did
it
intentionally.
then
if
you
want
to
attribute
it
to
the
city,
you
have
to
have
gross
indifference,
but
you
need
some
intentional
action,
don't
you,
for
a
due
process
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
mean
any
intentional
action,
i
mean,
the
deprivation
has
to
be
intentional.
you
have
to
intentionally
have
deprived
the
person
of
life,
liberty,
or
property,
not
by
mere
accident.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
then
when
the
army
is
grossly
negligent
or
something
or
a
general
is
grossly
negligent
in
the
conduct
of
a
battle
and
some
troops
are
killed...
or
deliberately
indifferent,
that's
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
these
people
would
have
been
deprived
of
their
lives,
and
there
would
have
been,
you
know,
deliberate
indifference.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
let's
say
deliberate
indifference.
that
is
a
violation
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
have
any
due
process
case
that
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
not
for
purpose
of
attributing
it
to
the
city.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
deliberate
indifference,
even
intentional
action
on
the
part
of
the
government,
that
is,
intentional
action
by
a
government
officer,
which
is
the
only
way
the
government
can
act,
the
tort
claims
act
carefully
excludes
intentional
torts.
and
i
guess
under
your
theory
of
what
substantive
due
process
embraces,
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
tort
claims
act
excludes
intentional
torts,
does
it,
because
you
could
have
a
bivens
action,
i
suppose
for
the
intentional
torts.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
aren't
constitutional,
but
not
against
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
be
a
constitutional
action
against
the
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
depriving
you
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--limb,
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
substantive
due
process
is
wonderful.
it
really...
it...
everything
turns
into
a
constitutional
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
they
knew
about
substantive
due
process
when
1983
was
enacted?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
this
line
of
cases
clearly
in
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
there
any
substantive
due
process
cases
on
the
books
at
the
time
1983
was
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
this
was
before
the
lochner
era
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
powe,
we
don't
say
that
for
purposes
of
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
for
example.
we
don't
say
that
you
can
do
whatever
you
like
to
government
employees
with
regard
to
restricting
their
speech,
because
after
all,
if
they
don't
like
it,
they
can
quit.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
should
it
be
any
different
for
substantive
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
substantive
due
process
clause
for
some
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
could
you...
because
you'd
lose
this
case
otherwise?
[laughter]
would
equal
protection
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
really
believe
in
substantive
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
powe,
why
is
custody
important?
i
am
trying
to
grasp...
i
understand
that
you
are
drawing
the
line
on
custody,
but
is
it
because
if
there
is
custody
there
is
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
violated,
as
opposed
to
the
substantive
due
process
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
provision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
real
constitutional
provisions,
the
ones
that
really
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
voluntary--
--i
suppose
a
member
of
the
state
national
guard
whose
commanding
officer
tells
him
to
go
down...
where
does
he
come?
i
mean,
he
is
an
employee
but
he
goes
to
jail
for
desertion
or
insubordination.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
this
situation,
if
it
were
intentional...
that
is,
not
deliberate
indifference,
but
the
state
said,
yeah,
we
know
there's
gas
down
there
and
you
are
going
to
get
hurt,
but
we
want
you
to
go
down.
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
could
be
a
more
clear
violation
of
substantive
due
process
than
intentionally
taking
somebody's
life...
intentionally
taking
somebody's
life.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
talk
about
relatively
more
obscure
things
such
as
the
other
rights,
privacy
rights
you
were
talking
about.
i
am
talking
about
killing
somebody
and
you
say
that
is
not
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
i
don't
understand
substantive
due
process
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not?
[laughter]
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
out
of
the
substantive
due
process
area?
