xxx
case
in
this
court,
in
your
support?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
closest--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
a
failure
to
train?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
case
in
this
court
dealing
with
police
using
undue
force
in
making
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
is
there
one
that
involves
liability
because
of
lack
of
training?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
involving
failure
to
train
would
apply
in
a
situation
like
that?
what
about
in
the...
what
about
in
the
fourth
amendment
case
where
they...
where
they've...
and
the
claim
is
that
the
municipality
failed
to
train
officers
about
what
the
rules
were
about
entering
a
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
training
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
say
that
there
be...
there
could
have
been
liability
if
there
had
been
an
abuse
of
governmental
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
it
ever...
has
that...
has
that
concept
been
given
some
content
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been...
what
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
governmental
power
in
a
case
like
this?
what
could
it
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
having
employees
is
an
exercise
of
governmental
power
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
did
you
argue
to
them
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
governmental
power
if
you
don't
train
your
employees
properly?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
passenger
in
custody
would
have
a
substantive
due
process
claim.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
custody
cases
we've
had
where
there
is
a
violation
of
recovery
is
our
eighth
amendment
cases,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
this
arrest
is
made
and
the
trouble
is
that
the
officer
driving
the
car
just
doesn't
know
how
to
drive.
and
the
reason
he...
one
of
the
reasons
he
doesn't
know
how
to
drive
is
that
they
didn't
even
inquire
whether
he
knew
how
to
drive
and
they
sent
him
out.
you
could
say
they
are
deliberately
indifferent.
would
you
say
that
is
a...
there
would
be
a
1983
action
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
i
don't
want
you
to
just
concede
it.
what's
your
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
you
get
that
and
you
go
to
trial
and
you
prove
that
they
just
didn't
seem
to
care
whether
the
people
who
drove
police
cars
knew
how
to
drive
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
legal
opinion
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
also
go
just
to
any
pedestrian
that
was
run
over
by
somebody
who
didn't
know
how
to
drive?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
don't
they
owe
some
duty
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
still
have
got
to
deal
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
really
believed
in
due
process.
they
just
didn't
ever
believe
that
there
was
anything
substantive
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there
are
some
others
that
are
in
the
penumbra.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
police
officer
goes
out
to
a
scene
of
some
confusion
or
commotion
and
wants
to
get
through
a
crowd
and
the
crowd
tries
to
block
him
and
he
just
uses
his
gun
or
his
stick
unnecessarily...
doesn't
intend
to
arrest
anybody,
he
just
wants
to
get
out,
and
he
hurts
somebody
unnecessarily...
would
you
seek...
you
could
plead
a
1983
action
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
form
of
coercion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say,
if
you
could
prove
that
there...
that
this
officer
wasn't
really
trained
and
there
was
deliberate
indifference
about
his
training,
that
it
would
be
a
1983
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
an
arguendo
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
shouldn't
just
compound
the
error.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a...
if
the
mayor
of
a
city
has
an
enemy
that
opposes...
has
opposed
him
and
he
knows
exactly
where
he
lives
and
there
is
a
snow
storm
and
he
tells
the
driver
of
the
snow
plow,
why
don't
you
just
tear
up
that
fellow's
lawn
in
the
process
of
cleaning
the
street
and
he
does
it,
and
i
take
it
that
this
is
no
difference
than
causing
a
death
or
anything.
it's
just
no
1983
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
treating
them
both
the
same,
you
just
don't
have
any
duty
to
either
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending...
are
you
defending
the
rationale
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
abuse
of
governmental
power
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
give
me
an
example.
there
isn't
any...
could
there
be
an
abuse
of
governmental
power
so-called
in
a
case
like
this
that
would
make
a
1983
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
give
me
another
case
where
there
would
be
a
abuse
of
power
that
would
make
the
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
custody
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
abuse
of
power
to
get
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
cases
in
conflict
with
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fifth
circuit's
put
itself
in
conflict
with
almost...
with
every
other
court
of
appeals?
