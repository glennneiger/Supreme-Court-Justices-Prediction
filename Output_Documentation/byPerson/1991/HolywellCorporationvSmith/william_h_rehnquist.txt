do
not
talk
until
you
get
outside

mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
stettin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that,
i
take
it,
does
not
bear
on
the
proper
decision
of
the
point
involved
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
doctrine
would
prevail
that
would
cause
the
general
creditors
to
prevail
there
where
they
would
not
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
really,
then,
we're
not
talking
about
a
situation
where
if
the
government
had
moved
before
all
the
payoffs
and
the
plan
was
completed
it
might
have
prevailed
but
now
it's
too
late
for
it
to
prevail.
i
mean,
i
take
it
many
plans
have
been
undone
because
perhaps
there
was
a
superior
lien
that
was
not
acknowledged
at
the
time
the
plan
was
executed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
you
agree,
or
tell
me
if
i
am
not
right,
that
the
fact
that
the
plan
has
been
consummated,
as
opposed
to
if
it
were
just
incipient,
does
not
bear
on
how
this
case
should
be
disposed
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
fact
that
the
plan
has
been
consummated
doesn't
change
the
applicable
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
stettin,
who
did
the...
in
the
view
of
the
participants
in
this
plan,
who
was
going
to
pay
the
tax
liability
that
obviously
was
owed
by
somebody
for
the
preconfirmation
activities?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
that
not
occur,
because
there
was
no...
nothing
went
back
to
the
debtors?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
a
similar
argument
to
that
rejected
in
the
key
case,
a
similar
argument
to
the
one
you're
making
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
the
bankruptcy
code
supplied
the
tax
consequences
rather
than
what
was
then
section
3466
at
the
time
of
the
key
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
please
wind
it
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stettin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
holywell
corporation
against
smith
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
