mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1789,
benjamin
franklin
said
that
there
is
nothing
certain
in
life
except
death
and
taxes.
for
200
years,
congress
has
endeavored
to
ensure
that
the
tax
part
of
this
saying
holds
true.
since
the
1790's,
congress
enacted
a
comprehensive
set
of
interlocking
provisions
designed
to
ensure
that
even
insolvent
taxpayers
and
their
fiduciaries
pay
taxes
owed
to
the
united
states.
this
case
involves
application
of
these
ancient
statutes
to
a
liquidating
trustee
appointed
by
a
bankruptcy
court
who
in
the
course
of
liquidating
and
investing
the
debtors'
assets
realized
more
than
$80
million
of
taxable
gains
and
interest
income.
since
the
debtors
had
been
stripped
of
their
assets
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
they
obviously
could
not
pay
the
taxes
due
on
this
income.
congress
anticipated
this
simple
fact
pattern
as
long
ago
as
1916
by
requiring
in
what
is
now
section
6012(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
receivers,
assignees,
and
trustees
in
bankruptcy
with
fiduciary
control
of
the
debtor's
assets
are
to
report
and
pay
the
taxes.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
in
this
case,
however,
that
the
liquidating
trustee
is
a
mere
contract
trustee
and
therefore
escapes
the
duty
to
report
and
pay
taxes.
inverting
the
statutory
scheme,
the
court
said
that
the
government
should
look
to
the
penniless
debtors
rather
than
to
the
trustee
for
taxes
on
the
income--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
trustee
should
file
returns
for
the
individual
debtor's
estate
and
for
the
corporate
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
assume
so,
but
that
would
be
completely
outside
the
scope
of
this
case.
the
individual
debtor,
if
he
has
income
during
the
period
that
he
is
in
bankruptcy
separate
from
his
estate,
that
income
would
be
taxable
to
him
personally
but
the
estate--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
with
respect
to
an
individual,
when
he
goes
into
bankruptcy
his
assets
form
a
separate
taxable
entity,
his
estate
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
that
separate
taxable
entity
for
the
individual
files
a
return.
the
trustee
does
that.
if
the
individual
is
working
or
somehow
has
income
independently
of
his
estate,
then
he
would
have
to
file
a
return
for
his
independent--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
it's...
that
is
in
fact
one
of
the
critical
issues.
it
is
quite
clearly
still
part
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
have
a
trustee
appointed
by
reorganization
plan
to
liquidate
the
debtors'
assets,
but
the
estate
continues
because
the
assets
have
not
been
returned
to
the
debtor
under
1141(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
both
for
the
corporation
and
separately
for
the
individual
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
have
a
corporation
named
holywell
which
has
several
consolidated
subsidiaries--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--all
of
which
should
file
one
return,
and
the
trustee
under
6012(b)
is
to
file
that
return.
in
addition,
we
have
an
individual
named
gould,
and
his
individual
estate,
the
return
for
that
should
be
filed
by
the
trustee,
also.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
under
section
1399
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
corporation
is
treated
differently
from
an
individual
when
it
goes
into
bankruptcy.
the
corporation
continues
to
be
a
taxable
entity
even
when
it's
in
bankruptcy,
so
the
trustee
under
6012(b)
has
to
file
a
return
for
the
corporation.
in
that
return,
he
reports
all
of
the
income
that
he
received
from
liquidating
and
managing
the
debtor's
properties.
it's
different
for
the
individual.
when
the
individual
goes
into
bankruptcy,
whatever
he
brought
to
the
bankruptcy
is
a
separate
taxable
entity
that
is...
and
the
return
on
that
is
made
by
the
trustee.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
as
i
will
attempt
to
explain
in
more
detail
later
on,
3713
of
title
31
is
called
the
absolute
priority
statute,
and
we
agree
with
the
debtors
that
it
is
a
safety
net,
if
you
will,
that
if
the
trustee
is
not
subject
to
reporting
and
paying
taxes
under
6012(b),
he
would
be
required
to
pay
taxes
under
the
absolute
priority
statute.
with
respect
to
28
usc
960,
which
is
the
other
statute
that
the
debtors
refer
to,
there
are
two
points
of
view
about
that
statute.
historically,
it
was
enacted
simply
to
make
clear
that
a
trustee
or
receiver
was
not
exempt
from
state
taxation,
and
the
statute
only
referred
to
state
taxation.
when
congress
recodified
title
28
in
1948,
for
some
reason
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
explain,
they
added
the
word
federal
to
the
statute,
and
so
now
it
says
that
the
officer
of
the
court
shall
be
responsible
for
state,
local,
and
federal
taxes.
since
there
is
no
legislative
history,
we
are
in
the
dark
on
what
congress
meant
to
accomplish.
the
i.j.
knight
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit,
concluded
that
all
that
the
word
federal
did
was
to
make
it
clear
that
there
was
no
negative
implication
that
somehow
a
trustee
should
be
protected
from
federal
taxation.
that's
one
view.
the
other
view
is
the
debtors',
which
is
that
by
putting
the
word
federal
in,
congress
made
many
of
these
other
statutes
unnecessary.
we
don't...
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
statute
in
this
case.
we
certainly
don't
think
that
the
court
need
reach
it
because
this
case
is
quite
comfortably
resolved
by
section
6012(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
is
where
we
would
anticipate
congress
would
place
tax
requirements.
the
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
we
don't
agree,
and
nor
is
there
any
authority
that
this
case
is
completed.
in
fact,
the
trustee
has
acknowledged
that
the
case
hasn't
been
closed.
a
case
can't
be
closed
in
bankruptcy
when
the
assets
of
the
estate
still
remain
within
the
estate,
as
the
bankruptcy
court
held
in
the
in
re
t.s.p.
case.
the
case
could
have
been
closed.
it
could
have
been
done
differently.
it
could
have
been
done
in
what
they
call
the
ordinary
fashion.
the
assets
could
have
been
liquidated
before
a
plan
was
provided
to
distribute
them.
we
agree
that
that
may
be
the
more
ordinary
route,
but
we
don't
think
congress
meant
this
statute
to
be
a
shell
game
that
allows
an
inventive
creditor
to
come
up
with
a
plan
where
the
assets
are
liquidated
within
the
estate
but
after
a
plan
is
confirmed
and
thereby
get
out
from
under
the
statute.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
in
fact
a
quite
ancient
statute.
it's
been
around
since
1916.
during
the
lengthy
history
of
this
statute
the
agency
and
the
courts
have
all
uniformly
applied
it
to
any
court-appointed
fiduciary
who
comes
into
control
of
a
debtor's
assets.
the
treasury
regulations,
which
were
adopted
back
in
the
twenties,
interpreted
the
phrase,
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
which
everyone
agrees
was
simply
modernized
in
1980
to
say
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11,
that
the
term
trustee
in
bankruptcy
explicitly
included
a
liquidating
trustee
or,
and
i
quote,
"any
other
person
designated
as
in
control
of
the
assets
of
a
debtor
in
any
bankruptcy
proceeding.
"
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's
correct.
we
also
think
that
he
comfortably
falls
within
that
definition
also.
again,
there
is
a
60-year-old
treasury
regulation
that
defines
an
assignee
as
simply
anyone
who
acquires
possession
and
control
of
a
debtor's
estate
for
the
purpose
of
paying
the
debts.
under
either
of
those
definitions,
either
of
those
regulations,
the
trustee
quite
clearly
is
caught,
and
congress
quite
clearly
intended
this
income
to
be
caught
for
taxation.
in
the
national
mufflers
case
this
court
held
that
an
agency...
that
the
treasury's
regulations
should
be
upheld
if
they
reasonably
implement
the
statute.
well,
no
one
disputes
that
these
trustees,
the
income
they
receive
is
intended
to
be
taxed
by
congress
and
that
these
regulations
reasonably
implement
the
statute.
if...
if
the
regulation
doesn't...
if
the
statute
doesn't
reach
the
trustee,
the
debtors
have
no
assets,
the
income
would
simply
escape
taxation.
that's
not
a
result
that
anyone
in
this
case
has
suggested
congress
intended.
the
trustee's
argument
that
this
is...
that
in
1980
when
congress
amended
the
statute
to
insert
the
modern
language,
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11,
that
they
converted
this
into
a
technical
term,
a
term
of
art.
that
technical
argument
has
no
basis
in
the
regulations
or
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
which
refers
simply
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
require
any
fiduciary
who
has
the
debtor's
assets
to
pay
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
that
all
creditors
will
be
affected
by
the
disposition,
because--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
trustee...
it's
our
understanding
the
trustee
has
a
large
amount
of
money
still
in
his
possession.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
i
don't
recall
that
they
appeared
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
according
to
the
record,
all
the
creditors
were
paid
100
percent
on
the
dollar,
except
the
united
states,
which
received
nothing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
really
not
certain,
your
honor,
what
the
financial
ramifications
of
that
would
be.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
my
assumption
would
be
that
somebody
would
have
to
return
some
money.
the
trustee
has
not
retained
sufficient
funds
to
pay
the
taxes,
so
he
would
have
to
get
it
back.
now,
as
we
know,
he
sought
and
obtained
an
indemnification
from
one
of
the
major
creditors
at
the
time
he
became
a
trustee.
he
looked
at
the
plan,
and
apparently
it
was
visible
to
him,
although
not
to
anyone
else,
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
gain
and
therefore
substantial
income
to
be
taxed.
instead
of
going
to
court
as
he
should
have,
according
to
this
court's
decision
in
king
v.
united
states,
and
told
the
bankruptcy
court
that
there's
a
big
tax
obligation
here,
he
went
to
the
creditor
who'd
proposed
the
plan
and
he
asked
them
for
and
received
from
them
an
indemnification
if
he
should
ever
be
held
liable
for
taxes,
and
the
bank
of
new
york--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--he
eventually
brought
this
suit.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
waited
2
years,
he
distributed
a
lot
of
money,
and
when
he
brought
this
suit
he
said
either
i'm
not
liable
for
taxes,
or
if
i
am
liable
the
bank
of
new
york
should
pay
me
because
they
defrauded
me
and
the
estate
by
proposing
a
plan
that
didn't
provide
for
these
taxes.
well,
it's
pretty
evident
the
trustee
wasn't
defrauded,
but
it
is
also
clear
that
the
estate
was
not
properly
implemented.
we
don't
have
to
reach
here
any
of
these
questions,
though,
about
the
scope
of
the
trustee's
fiduciary
liability
or
his
liability
as
an
individual.
we
anticipate
that
collection
can
occur
through
the
moneys
the
trustee
has
and
through
the
indemnification
that
the
bank
of
new
york
provided.
i
would
like
to
address
the
suggestion
that
there
is
a
difficulty
with
calling
this
trustee
a
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11.
given
the
broad
history
of
the
statute
and
this
court's
opinion
in
bramwell
v.
u.s.
fidelity,
that's
a
very
difficult
argument
for
the
trustee
to
make.
in
bramwell,
the
court
specifically
concluded
that
terms
such
as
executor,
receiver,
and
assignee
are
to
be
given
a
functional
rather
than
a
technical
meaning
in
statutes
requiring
fiduciaries
and
insolvents
to
pay
taxes.
the
court
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
the
spring
valley
water
case
and
in
united
states
v.
key,
in
which
the
court
specifically
said
that
such
provisions
are,
quote,
"to
be
liberally
construed
to
achieve
their
broad
purpose
of
ensuring
a
certain
payment
of
taxes.
"
with
respect
to
this
trustee,
he
acknowledges
he
is
a
trustee.
he
acknowledges
that
this
is
a
case
under
title
11.
he
concedes
he
was
appointed
as
and
functions
as
a
trustee
in
this
case
under
title
11.
he
posted
a
bond
as
a
trustee,
as
required
by
section
322
of
title
11,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
not
appointed
until
the
plan
was
confirmed
has
no
bearing
on
this
because
section
1123
of
the
bankruptcy
code
specifically
contemplates
that
a
trustee
can
be
authorized
or
appointed
to
liquidate
an
estate
pursuant
to
a
plan
of
what
in
this
case
is
called
a
plan
of
reorganization.
when
this
occurs,
the
estate
continues,
the
trustees
admitted
that
the
estate...
the
case
hasn't
closed,
the
bankruptcy
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
supervise
the
trustee,
to
approve
claims,
and
the
trustee
in
every
sense
continues
to
act
as
a
trustee
in
the
case.
as
we've
already
discussed,
if
the
statute
had
a
gap
it
would
be
filled
by
the
words,
assignee,
which
applies,
according
to
the
regulations,
to
anyone
who
comes
into
custody
or
control
of
the
assets
for
the
purpose
of
paying
the
debtor's
debts.
the
collateral
consequence
that
occurs
if
the
trustee
is
deemed
to
be
an
assignee
is
somewhat
significant,
and
i
touched
on
it
briefly.
the
united
states
would
have
an
absolute
priority
for
the
payment
of
taxes
under
the
absolute
priority
statute,
instead
of
a
bankruptcy
priority
under
501(b)(1)
of
the
code
and
under
the
plan,
and
the
trustee
would
also
be
personally
liable
for
taxes
under
3713(b).
we
differ
with
the
debtors
on
this
only
in
that
we
think
it's
clear
under
cases
like
in
re
san
juan
hotel
from
the
first
circuit
in
1981
that
a
trustee
has
a
fiduciary
duty
under
title
11
to
pay
taxes
and
can
be
personally
liable
if
he
fails
to
do
so.
to
this
point,
all
i've
talked
about
is
the
corporate
estate.
the
trustee's
duty
to
file
a
return
for
the
individual
is
under
(b)(4)
rather
than
(b)(3),
which
requires
any
fiduciary
of
an
individual
estate
to
file
a
return.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
trustee
is
not
a
fiduciary
because
his
duties
are
too
ministerial.
in
king
v.
united
states
the
court
rejected
a
similar
claim
that
a
disbursing
agent
had
only
ministerial
functions
and
was
not
liable
as
a
fiduciary
for
ensuring
payment
of
taxes
on
a
bankrupt
estate.
in
that
case,
the
court
emphasized
that
what
is
critical
is
the
element
of
control
that
the
fiduciary
has
over
the
assets
and
not
the
scope
of
his
discretion.
as
judge
cox
noted
in
his
dissent
in
this
case,
the
trustee's
duties
here
were
far
from
ministerial.
he
was
appointed
to
receive
and
manage
the
assets,
to
identify
and
determine
claims
against
the
estate,
to
liquidate
and
invest
the
assets,
and
ultimately
to
make
distributions.
those
are
precisely
the
type
of
duties
that
a
fiduciary
performs
in
a
bankruptcy,
and
prior
to
this
case
every
court
of
appeals
that
had
considered
the
issue
had
uniformly
concluded
that
a
liquidating
trustee
in
an
individual
bankruptcy
is
a
fiduciary
subject
to
section
12(b)(4).
there
are
three
other
issues
that
i'd
like
to
touch
upon
briefly
that
respondents
have
asserted.
they
have
asserted
that
perhaps
this
is
a
grantor
trust
and
that
as
a
grantor
trust
the
fiduciary
should
not
be
liable
for
taxes.
a
grantor
trust
arises
when
someone
creates
a
trust
but
retains
the
power
to
determine
the
disposition
of
the
assets.
the
depinto
decision
from
the
second
circuit
and
collier
on
bankruptcy
both
say
that
a
bankruptcy
cannot
be
a
grantor
trust
because
the
debtor
doesn't
retain
any
control
over
the
disposition
of
the
assets.
clearly,
this
debtor
doesn't
retain
any
control
over
the
estate.
they've
also
argued
that
there
is
a
bar
date
for
the
government's
tax
claim.
this
argument
doesn't
sit
well
for
the
trustee
because
he
apparently
was
aware
of
the
tax
issue
from
the
beginning
and
made
no
effort
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
as
he's
required
to.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
bar
date
for
tax
claims
that
arise
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
reorganization
plan.
those
claims
are
an
administrative
expense
under
articles
5
and
6
of
the
plan.
the
court
has
entered
no
bar
date
for
administrative
expenses.
the
only
bar
that
has
been
entered
was
with
respect
to
attorney's
fee
applications
as
administrative
expenses,
which
i
assume
has
been
lifted
because
counsel
for
the
trustee
has
recently
filed
an
attorney's
fee
application.
the
third
issue
that
the
trustee
asserts
is
that
the
united
states
should
have
been
more
diligent
in
protecting
its
rights.
well,
congress
was
diligent
in
protecting
the
rights
of
the
united
states,
and
has
been
since
the
absolute
priority
statute
was
enacted
in
the
1790's.
these
statutes
require
the
trustee
to
assess
himself
and
to
report
to
the
united
states.
since
he
has
not
done
that,
even
to
this
date
filed
a
return
as
required
by
law,
he
cannot
claim
that
the
united
states...
any
time
has
begun
to
run
against
the
claim
of
the
united
states.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
the
trustee's
argument,
what
was
omitted
was
the
objective
of
congress
in
enacting
these
statutes,
which
was
to
ensure
that
insolvents'
income
doesn't
escape
taxation.
the
regulations
that
have
been
in
existence
for
decades
quite
clearly
encompass
this
trustee.
congress
did
not
reject
those
regulations
in
1980
when
it
inserted
the
words,
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11,
into
the
statute.
the
legislative
history--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
there's
been
no
suggestion
by
any
court
that
the
government
is
estopped
or
barred
by
any
bankruptcy
code
provision.
all
of
the
arguments
that
you've
heard
from
the
trustee
on
that
point
are
just
sort
of
equitable
arguments
about
gee,
if
the
government
had
been
diligent,
maybe
they
could
have
protected
themselves.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
was
nothing
that
the
government
should
have
done
that
it
needed
to
do
that
wasn't
performed
in
this
case.
the
plan
has
a
direct
basis
for
the
payment
of
taxes.
if
the
trustee
had
been
diligent,
he
would
have
paid
them.
the
plan
provides
in
articles
5
and
6
that
the
obligations
of
the
trustee
are
an
administrative
expense
of
the
estate.
one
of
the
obligations
of
the
trustee
under
6012(b)
is
to
report
and
pay
taxes.
if
he
had
performed
that
obligation
it
would
have
been
a
charge,
an
administrative
expense,
first
priority
under
this
bankruptcy
plan,
and
the
united
states
would
have
been
paid
first
if
he
had
done
that.
instead,
he
went
and
got
an
indemnification
from
the
other
creditors
who
said,
give
me
the
money
now.
if
the
government
wins
this
tax
issue
later
on,
i'll
indemnify
you.
now,
the
other--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is
a
statutory
obligation.
it
is
nonetheless
an
obligation
of
the
trustee,
which
is
what
the
plan
talks
about.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
it's
on
page
44
of
the
joint
appendix.
paragraph
6,
all
costs,
expenses,
and
obligations
incurred
by
the
trustee
in
administering
the
trust
shall
be
a
charge
against
the
trust
property.
one
of
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--absolutely.
it
was
incurred
because
their
gain
was
recognized
during
the
administration
of
the
trust
postconfirmation.
it
is
an
administrative
expense
under
the
code,
503(b)(1)(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
it
is
an
administrative
expense
under
this
plan
because
it
is
an
obligation
of
the
trustee,
and
if
you
will
note,
on
page,
i
believe
46
of
the
joint
appendix,
class
1
claims,
which
is
the
kind
of
claim
this
administrative
expense
is,
incurred
subsequent
to...
it
says
consummation
but
it
should
say
confirmation
date,
shall
be
paid
as
soon
as
practicable.
what
he
should
have
done
with
respect
to
this
claim,
once--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
sir.
a
class
1
claim
is
an
administrative
claim
that
is
an
obligation
of
the
trustee.
now,
he
has--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
hasn't
been
allowed
or
ordered
because
he
hasn't
submitted
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
all
i
was
suggesting
was
if
he
had
implemented
the
plan
as
he
should
have,
he
would
have
submitted
this
for
the
court
for
approval,
it
would
have
been
approved,
it
would
have
been
a
class
1
claim
under
the
plan,
and
it
would
have
been
paid.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
for
the
individual
estate,
it
certainly
is.
it
is
a
separate
taxable
entity
from
the
day
that
the
individual
goes
into
bankruptcy.
the
only
concession
that
we
ever
made
about
separate
taxable
entities
is
what
the
statute
says.
1399
of
the
internal
revenue
code
says
that
when
a
corporation
goes
in
its
estate
is
not
a
separate
entity,
separate
from
the
corporation.
all
of
this
discussion
about...
that
somehow
we've
conceded
that
we
can't
tax
the
trust
is
utterly
off
the
point.
the
trust
is
taxable
as
a
separate
entity
for
the
individual,
and
it
is
taxable
because
it
holds
the
corporation's
assets
for
the
corporation.
i
want
to
just
refer
once
again
to
this
idea
that
somehow
the
government's
estopped
on
a
diligence
theory.
nothing
in
the
disclosure
statement
indicated
there
would
be
a
penny's
worth
of
gain
from
this
real
estate
transaction.
unless
the
united
states
has
to
assume
that
every
piece
of
real
estate
that
is
sold
is
going
to
create
a
large
taxable
gain
and
that
the
trustee
is
not
going
to
properly
implement
the
plan
that
requires
him
to
pay
his
obligations
and
to
hold
them
as
class
1,
why
would
the
united
states
have
done
anything?
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to.
it
was
the
trustee
that
should
have
done
something
if
he
felt
there
was
a
taxable
gain,
and
the
only
thing
he
did
when
he
decided
there
was
a
taxable
gain
was
to
get
an
indemnity
instead
of
paying
the
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
would
rely
on
the
regulatory
definition,
which
we
do
think
focuses
on
what
the
statute
is
intended
to
guard
against,
and
that
is
that
an
assignee
who
obtains
possession
of
the
assets
of
the
debtor
for
the
purpose
of
paying
the
debtor's
debts,
we
think
that's
the
kind
of
assignee
that
the
statute
reaches.
that's
what
the
regulations
say.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
that...
only
for
the
part
of
it
that
involves
an
assignment,
and
there
was
an
assignment
here
to
the
trustee.
under
the
plan,
the
assets
of
the
estate
were
assigned
directly
to
the
trustee
and
he
was
empowered
to
manage
them
in
any
manner
that
any
owner
would
be
empowered
to.
the
trustee
did
have
a
broad
discretion.
the
only
case
that
he
cites
for
his
grantor
trust
argument
is
this
in
re
sonner
case.
sonner
is
an
unusual
case,
because
it
involved
a
fiduciary
of
an
individual's
estate,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
simply
missed
6012(b)(4).
the
court
said
that
there
was
no...
that
6012(b)(3)
didn't
reach
the
trustee
because
that
involves
corporations,
and
the
court
never
even
considered
the
fact
that
(b)(4)
applies
to
fiduciaries
such
as
trustees
in
a
bankruptcy.
also,
in
re
sonner,
we
submit,
is
simply
wrong
because
every
bankruptcy
estate
would
then
be
a
grantor
trust.
the
trustee
would
never
have
to
file
tax
returns
under
60(b)(12)...
i'm
sorry,
6012(b)
as
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
if
a
bankruptcy
is
a
grantor
trust.
congress
didn't
think
so,
and
neither
did
the
second
circuit
in
the
depinto
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
