mr.
herbert
stettin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
october
10,
1985,
the
plan
of
reorganization
of
holywell
and
mr.
gould
and
the
other
joined
debtors
was
confirmed
and
made
effective.
it
became
effective
on
that
date,
and
on
that
day
the
liquidating
trustee
assumed
his
powers.
he
had
absolutely
no
contact
with
this
case
prior
to
that
time.
it
was
a
chapter
11
that
had
been
confirmed
without
his
involvement
in
any
manner.
he
was
not
affiliated
with
the
debtors.
he
was
not
affiliated
with
any
of
the
creditors.
he
was
simply
named
in
the
plan
which
had
been
proposed
by
the
major
creditor...
the
bank
of
new
york...
and
his
job
was
severely
delimited.
he
was
told
what
to
do
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
a
plan
he
did
nothing
at
all
to
obtain
the
confirmation
of.
his
job
was
very
simple.
he
was
to
sell
the
miami
center
property,
the
hotel
and
the
office
building,
and
he
was
to
sell
it
to
the
bank
of
new
york,
and
they
were
going
to
satisfy
their
mortgage
and
pay
the
excess
in
cash
to
him
and
he
was
going
to
administer
that
cash
and
some
other
cash
that
he
got
from
sale
of
other
properties,
and
he
was
going
to
pay
the
claims
of
all
the
other
creditors
under
the
plan
called
classes
1
through
6,
and
they
did
get
paid.
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
think
there
are
no
other
unpaid,
unsecured
creditors.
they've
all
been
paid.
that
plan
also
provided
the
government
was--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--oh,
yes,
there
is
a
distinct
possibility
if
this
is
undone,
and
the
bankruptcy
court,
district
court,
and
eleventh
circuit
made
this
point.
the
confirmed
plan
has
been
substantially
consummated.
if
we
are
now
obligated
to
go
back
and
redetermine
the
priority
of
payments
and
the
government
is
held
entitled
to
receive
taxes
and
given
a
priority
for
the
payment
of
those
moneys,
it
may
very
be
that
other
creditors
will
have
to
disgorge
moneys
that
they
received.
we
don't
know
that
yet,
but
it
is
likely
that
that
may
happen.
the
government
was
not
left
out
of--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--to
an
extent
it
does,
in
that--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--there
is
no
general
doctrine
that
would
cause
the
general
creditors
to
prevail
over
the
government
if
the
government
were
in
fact
entitled
to
priority
and
right
of
payment
of
these
taxes.
mr.
herbert
stettin
clearly,
there
are
methods
by
which
a
plan
can
be
undone,
to
use
your
phrase.
this
plan
has
been
substantially
consummated,
and
in
fact
in
an
earlier
proceeding
this
court
denied
certiorari
from
an
appeal
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
that
the--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--you
are
correct
if
section
6012(b)
does
apply
to
this
liquidating
trustee.
mr.
herbert
stettin
if
6012(b)
applies,
it
does
not
change
the
applicable
law.
in
order
for
us
to
prevail,
we
must
be
able
to
show
you
that
6012(b)
does
not
apply
to
this
liquidating
trustee,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
that
i
get
a
little
more
detailed
in
facts,
i
apologize.
the
government
took
the
position
that
they
received
nothing
under
this
plan.
that
is
not
true.
the
government
was
a
creditor
in
this
case.
they
had
filed
proofs
of
claim
for
taxes,
prepetition
taxes,
and
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
when
confirmation
became
effective,
they
got
paid.
what
they
didn't
do
was
avail
themselves
of
every
one
of
the
remedies
which
the
bankruptcy
code
provides.
they
received
notice
of
every
single
thing
that
was
going
on
in
this
case.
bankruptcy
rule
2002(j)
mandates
that
they
get
notice
of
what
is
happening.
they
were
a
creditor.
they
did
get
a
copy
of
the
plan
and
the
disclosure
statement.
that
plan
and
that
disclosure
statement
did
not
contain
a
provision
for
the
payment
of
taxes
to
the
government
on
any
sale
or
gain--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--several
things
would
have
happened.
first,
if
they
had
said,
the
disclosure
statement
is
defective,
it
doesn't
say
what
the
tax
effect
of
what
we're
going
to
do
is.
we're
going
to
sell
this
property
back
to
the
bank
and
you're
not
going
to
get
enough
money
to
pay
the
taxes
that'll
become
due.
it's
very
common
that
property
is
transferred
in
satisfaction
of
a
mortgage
and
you
don't
have
enough
money
left
to
pay
the
taxes
that
accrue
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
herbert
stettin
it
should
have
been
obvious
to
everyone.
my
client,
the
liquidating
trustee,
did
not
even
exist
at
that
time.
what
he
found
when
he
became
the
trustee
of
this
plan
was
a
plan
which
had
a
disclosure
statement
that
did
not
tax-effect
this
plan,
and
the
cases
are
absolutely
clear.
you
cannot
confirm
a
plan
if
you
don't
provide
this
type
of
information.
the
government
could
have
voted
against
this
plan.
the
government
could
have
appealed
from
the
order
of
confirmation.
they
did
none
of
these
things.
they
took
the
money--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--the
plan
would
not
have
been
confirmable
because
one
of
the
requirements
under
section
1129
is
that
the
plan
be
shown
to
be
capable
of
successfully
being
carried
out.
mr.
herbert
stettin
whether
it
was--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--yes.
i
was
not
counsel
to
him
then.
i
became
counsel
to
him
later.
mr.
herbert
stettin
without
question,
the
expenses
in
this
case
were
significant
for
all
parties,
including
counsel
for
the--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--the
government
had
the
opportunity
and
did
not
take
advantage
of
it.
other
parties
also
had
the
opportunity
and
did
not
take
advantage.
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
the
government
to
take
any
efforts
at
all
to
determine
what
rights
they
had,
what
taxes
they
were
owed,
the
moneys
were
paid
out
exactly
as
the
plan
required.
the
trustee
found
himself
when
he
took
effect
on
october
10,
1985,
with
an
absolute
requirement.
section
1142(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
says
that
the
person
charged
with
carrying
out
the
terms
of
the
plan,
the
only
other
instance
in
the
bankruptcy
code
where
they
talk
about
a
liquidating
trustee
in
a
chapter
11,
shall
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
plan
and
must
obey
the
orders
of
the
court.
the
orders
of
the
court
were
very
basic:
sell
the
property
to
the
bank,
sign
a
deed
to
do
that,
take
the
money
that
you
get
and
pay
the
allowed
claims
and
administrative
expenses
and
pay
them
as
the
court
ordered,
and
none
of
those
expenses...
none
of
those
costs
included
the
government.
the
trustee
was
supposed
to,
if
i
understand
the
government
correctly,
the
moment
he
took
effect
on
october
10,
to
say
i
will
not
obey
the
order
of
the
court
appointing
me
and
carry
out
this
plan,
or,
i
will
convey
the
property
to
the
bank,
but
i
won't
pay
the
cash
that
i
get
to
any
other
creditors
because
they
may
be,
in
fact,
inferior
to
the
government.
mr.
herbert
stettin
no.
mr.
herbert
stettin
he
could
legally
have
done
that,
except
that
it
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
plan
within
the
time
required
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
herbert
stettin
well,
he
did
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
plan
to
the
extent
of
taking
the
money
from
the
bank
and
paying
it
to
the
creditors
whom
the
plan
obligated
him
to
pay.
if
i
can,
i
would
like
to
address
the
inapplicability
of
section
6012(b),
because
i
believe
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
6012(b),
in
the
first
portion
of
it,
deals
with
returns
for
corporations,
and
(4)
deals
with
returns
for
estates.
i'm
going
to
take
them
in
reverse
order,
if
i
may.
mr.
gould
is
an
individual.
he
was
an
individual
chapter
11
debtor.
when
he
filed
his
chapter
11...
i
think
it's
title
26,
section
1398
required
that
a
new
taxpayer
was
created
and
a
new
tax
return
would
be
filed,
so
that
during
the
chapter
11
proceeding
mr.
gould,
if
he
had
individual
income
of
his
own,
would
file
his
own
tax
return,
and
the
debtor
in
possession,
mr.
gould
himself,
incidentally,
would
file
his
return
as
a
debtor
in
possession.
there
would
be
two
returns
filed
during
the
chapter
11
proceeding.
when
the
plan
was
confirmed
the
estate
terminated.
the
bankruptcy
code
says
that.
at
that
point,
mr.
gould
resumed
entire
control
over
his
fate
and
this
plan
specifically
said
that
he
was
discharged
of
his
debts
and
that
he
was
free
to
go
on
about
his
business,
and
he
incurred
the
obligation
at
that
point
to
file
his
own
tax
returns
again,
and
he
did.
in
this
case,
mr.
gould...
and
the
briefs
say
this...
did
file
his
own
tax
returns
following
confirmation
for
the
first
year,
before
it
was
decided
he
did
not
want
to
follow
that
path.
now,
the
three
requirements
under
sub
(4)
of
6012
say
that
a
fiduciary
of
an
estate
has
to
file
a
return
for
that.
well,
this
is
not
an
estate.
this
is
not
a
probate
proceeding.
it
also
says
that
the
fiduciary
of
a
trust
has
to
file
it.
there
was
a
concession
made
at
the
trial
of
this
case
before
the
bankruptcy
court
and
conceded
at
every
level,
including
this
court,
except
by
the
debtor...
the
government
still
concedes
this...
that
the
liquidating
trust
is
not
a
separately
taxable
entity.
in
and
of
itself
it
is
not
taxable.
its
taxable
obligations,
its
tax
obligations,
arise
entirely
because
of
the
wording
of
sections
6012(b)(4).
in
fact,
it
is
not
a
taxable
trust,
the
government
concedes.
the
debtor
does
not
say
that.
the
debtor
says
that
we
are
a
taxable
trust
and
therefore
have
to
file
a
return
for
that.
in
fact,
we
are
a
grantor
trust,
which
the
internal
revenue
code
specifically
recognizes
as
not
being
taxable
to
the
trust.
it
is
taxable
to
the
settlor,
to
the
person
who
in
fact
has
his
property
used
to
pay
his
debts,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
stettin
if
it
had
any
obligation
at
all,
justice
kennedy,
it
had
a
disclosure...
like
a
partnership
return
being
filed
just
for
informational
purposes,
but
it
had
no
obligation
to
pay
tax,
and
clearly
no
return
filing
obligation
under
6012
as
contended
by
the
government.
a
grantor
trust
is
nothing
more
than
taking
property
from
some
entity,
a
person
in
this
case,
and
using
it
specifically,
by
contract,
to
pay
his
debts,
and
returning
the
excess
back
to
the
grantor.
clearly,
the
service
says
that
the
grantor
is
liable
for
the
taxes,
and
there's
no
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be,
because
in
fact
it
was
his
property
in
this
case.
mr.
gould
got
all
the
benefits...
all
the
tax
benefits...
for
years
prior
to
the
confirmation
of
this
plan
for
any
depreciation
or
other
expenses
in
the
operation
of
the
miami
center.
mr.
herbert
stettin
the
plan
is
entirely
silent
on
that
issue.
i
believe
that
the
record
reflects
that
it
was
intended
by
everyone,
because
the
plan
provided
this,
that
as
soon
as
all
of
the
claims
of
other
creditors
were
paid
the
excess
would
be
returned
to
the
debtors,
they
were
discharged
of
all
of
their
prepetition
obligations,
the
trustee
was
enjoined
not
to
change
their
business
so
that
he
could
not
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
continue
on,
and
the
debtors
with
the
property
revested
in
them
after
the
payment
of
their
debts
would
pay
whatever
taxes
were
due.
mr.
herbert
stettin
this
case
is
not
closed
5
years
and
a
couple
of
months
after
confirmation
because
of
the
incredible
volume
of
appeals.
we
are
in
our
90th,
or
95th
separate
appellate
proceeding;
10
petitions
have
been
filed
before
this
court.
this
is
the
first
in
which
certiorari
was
granted.
the
trustee
has
simply
defended
himself
on
a
regular
basis
from
appellate
proceedings
initiated
by
mr.
gould
and
holywell
corporation,
and
the
records
of
the
federal
report
are
replete
with
it.
the
last
item
in
6012(b)(4),
which
requires
filing
by
fiduciary,
is
of
the
estate
of
an
individual
under
chapter
7
or
11
of
title
11,
and
i
believe
it
was
justice
o'connor
who
pointed
out
well,
didn't
this
estate
end
when
confirmation
occurred?
it
did,
and
in
fact
mr.
gould
himself
recognizes
this
in
his
brief.
the
government
says
otherwise.
that's
one
of
the
clear
distinctions,
the
issues
between
us.
the
government
says
the
estate
doesn't
end,
that
the
filing
requirements
during
the
chapter
11
are
simply
shifted
from
the
debtor
in
possession
to
the
liquidating
trustee.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
given
for
that.
there
is
no
case
citation
given
for
that.
in
fact,
in
the
brief
of--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--the
one
case
which
both
briefs
discuss
is
in
re
sonner.
it
is
a
bankruptcy
decision
in
which
similar
facts
occur.
in
a
chapter
11
proceeding
a
liquidating
trust
was
set
up,
and
it
was
determined
to
be
nontaxable
to
the
liquidating
trustee,
in
part
because
it
was
a
grantor...
it
determined
to
be
a
grantor.
mr.
herbert
stettin
it
is.
mr.
herbert
stettin
that's
the
only
one
that
directly
addresses
the
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
from
both
briefs.
i
would
suggest
to
you,
in
the
very
last
two
pages
of
our
brief
we
pointed
out
that
the
service
has
the
means
to
even
correct
that
problem
if
they
wish.
there
was
statutory
authority
given
in
1986
to
the
service
to
establish
regulations
taxing
grantor
trusts.
the
service
has
not
issued
any
regulations
taxing
grantor
trusts
to
this
day.
it
wouldn't
apply
in
any
event,
because
it
predates...
our
trust
predates
the
effective
date
of
that
statute
by
approximately
a
year,
but
the
argument
that
the
government
raises
that
there
is
a
loophole
of
troubling
proportions
was
very
troubling
to
me
as
well.
this
is
a
loophole,
clearly,
on
grantor
trusts
they
have
the
means
and
ability
to
correct,
and
they
have
chosen
not
to
to
this
point.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
pass
to
6012(b)(3).
this
is
the
one
that
requires
where
you've
got
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
it
says
in
a
case
where
a
receiver...
clearly
we
are
not
a
receiver,
the
bankruptcy
court
forbids
the
appointment
of
a
receiver...
or
a
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11,
or
an
assignee
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
or
otherwise--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--we
think
not,
and
the
reason
we
think
not
is
because
the
6012
statute
and
every
one
of
the
predecessors,
going
as
far
back
as
mr.
jones
has
mentioned,
has
never
applied
6012(b)
to
someone
who
did
not
have
control
over
a
debtor
or
a
debtor's
property.
we're
not
talking
about
operation
of
its
business.
that
was
in
the
statute
originally.
mr.
herbert
stettin
i
believe
that
the
regulations
the
government
mentions
are
under
another
tax
statute,
and
they
are
not
the
regulations
under
this
statute.
all
of
the
cases--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--the
government
has
argued
that.
they
say...
and
they
use
a
webster's
dictionary
definition
of
assignee
to
say
someone
who,
i
believe,
is
a
transferee
of
property.
if
that
were
true,
then
why
would
you
need
to
say,
receive
a
trustee
in
a
case
or
assignee
by
order
of
a
court
and
so
on.
all
you'd
have
to
say--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--clearly,
if
congress
intended
that
the
government
get
its
taxes
when
you've
got
an
insolvent
debtor
who
has
got
property
in
the
hands
of
a
third
person,
all
you'd
say...
all
you'd
need
to
say
is
that
any
person
who
holds
possession
or
title
or
control...
any
person,
without
describing
what
they
are.
but
in
fact
they
didn't
do
that.
an
assignee--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--oh,
surely.
if
it
were
in
a
chapter
11...
that
is,
before
confirmation,
justice
kennedy...
there's
no
question
that
the
trustee
in
the
chapter
11
or
the
debtor
in
possession
in
the
chapter
11
would
have
to
file
tax
returns,
but
this
is
postconfirmation.
mr.
herbert
stettin
he
is
an
assignee
technically,
because
by
operation
of
law
all
of
the
property
of
the
prepetition
debtor
is
transferred
to
him.
mr.
herbert
stettin
that's
certainly
one
instance
of
an
assignee,
but
i
would
agree
with
you,
why
would
you
have
to
use
separate
words
for
it
if
you
intended
it
that
way?
mr.
herbert
stettin
i
believe
it
was
because
it
was
intended
that
the
plan
would
be
consummated
substantially
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
the
excess
property
not
needed
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
debtors
would
be
returned
to
the
debtors
who
would
remain
in
control
of
their
own
fate
and
pay
their
own
taxes.
mr.
herbert
stettin
no.
the
debtor's
plan...
there
were
two
competing
plans
here.
the
bank's
plan
was
the
one
that
was
confirmed.
it
was
voted
on
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
creditors
in
favor.
the
debtor's
plan
mentioned
that
on
a
liquidation
analysis
attached
to
the
disclosure
statement
that
there
were
some
tax
consequences.
the
debtor's
plan
also
indicated,
by
the
way,
that
there
would
be
a
sale
of
the
miami
center
to
a
different
buyer
for
a
different
price.
mr.
herbert
stettin
they
should.
in
fact,
there
are
a
line
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
that
say
that
if
an
objection
is
made
on
the
ground
that
no
tax
effect
is
discussed
in
the
disclosure
statement,
the
court
should
not
permit
the
disclosure
statement
to
go
out
and
certainly
should
not
confirm
a
plan,
because
you
don't
know
if
you
can
actually
consummate
it.
you
don't
know
if
you'll
have
enough
money...
the
key
to
the
consummation
of
any
plan.
i
was
thinking--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--no,
i
have
not.
i
have
not.
mr.
herbert
stettin
because
it
would
cover
people
clearly
not
intended
to
be
covered
as
assignees.
if,
for
example,
a
corporation
were
to
have
bought
property
of
a
debtor
outside
a
bankruptcy
setting
and
paid
fair
market
value,
full
cash
consideration,
the
purchaser
is
an
assignee
by
definition
because
they
are
transferred
the
property
of
the
debtor,
but
clearly
they're
not
liable
to
file
a
tax
return
for
the
debtor
they
just
paid
and
pay
the
tax
of
the
debtor
they
just
paid.
there
isn't
any
reason
to
do
that.
the
only
time
it
ever
arises
is
when
you've
got
an
insolvent
debtor
and
you've
got
these
unique
circumstances
where
there
is
some
doubt
that
the
government
will
be
able
to
get
its
tax
money.
that's
when
the
priorities
take
effect.
i
do
agree
with
the
government
that
there
is
an
attempt
to
create
a
pattern
of
preference
to
the
government.
outside
of
bankruptcy,
before
bankruptcy
ever
occurs,
3713
flat
out
says
that
if
you've
got
the
following
conditions,
if
a
debtor
owes
the
government
money
and
the
debtor
is
insolvent
and
he
makes
a
voluntary
assignment
of
his
property...
the
government's
argument,
by
the
way,
is
that
this
was
involuntary...
but
if
he
makes
a
voluntary
assignment
of
his
property,
then
the
government
gets
paid
first,
and
if
they
don't,
the
person
who
makes
that
transfer
is
personally
liable.
the
statute
has
to
have
the
last
part
of
it
read.
it
says,
in
sub
(2),
this
subsection
does
not
apply
to
a
case
under
title
11,
and
the
logic
is
obvious.
as
long
as
you're
not
in
bankruptcy
you
can
establish
a
priority
of
payment
rights
to
the
government
for
their
taxes.
once
you
go
into
bankruptcy
you've
got
to
try
and
read
the
bankruptcy
code
together
with
the
internal
revenue
code.
you've
got
to
try
and
make
sense
out
of
both
of
them,
it
seems
to
me,
rather
than
say
that
one
trumps
the
other,
to
use
the
phrase.
mr.
herbert
stettin
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
provides
the
preference
to
the
government
in
the
payment
of
taxes
due,
and
it
clearly
says
that,
and
mr.
jones
cited
you
the
statute...
503,
i
believe
it
is.
in
addition--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--i
believe
it's
507.
i
think
you're
right,
sir.
mr.
herbert
stettin
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
the
argument--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--i
must
confess
to
you
that
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
the
facts
in
key
to
be
able
to
respond
accurately.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
3713
is
simply
entirely
inapplicable
to
this
case.
by
its
own
terms,
it
says
it
doesn't
apply
in
a
chapter
11
case,
in
a
case
under
title
11
at
all.
if
it
is
a
bankruptcy
situation,
the
government
is
given
the
priorities
accorded
it.
it
is
also
given
the
opportunity
to
protect
itself.
the
government
in
this
case
simply
chose
not
to.
it
chose
to
wait,
and
its
argument
today
is,
when
everyone
else
has
relied
on
what
had
happened,
it
is
entitled
at
this
late
stage
to
come
in
and
say
37...
pardon
me...
6012(b)(3)
simply
says,
regardless
of
whatever
else
happened,
if
we
can
make
it
applicable
to
you
we're
going
to
ask
you
to
unravel
this
substantially
consummated
plan.
now,
i
am
very
sensitive
to
the
argument
that
if
they're
entitled
to
the
money
under
any
circumstances
they
ought
to
be
entitled
to
get
it
regardless
of
when
they
ask
for
it,
because
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--and
because
rule
2002(j)
requires
that
notice
be
given
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
herbert
stettin
but
they
were
in
this
case,
as
you
point
out.
mr.
herbert
stettin
yes,
absolutely,
without
any
qualification.
the
government,
in
fact,
in
a
footnote
in
their
brief
do
concede
that
they
simply
filed
nothing
at
all...
no
objections
to
disclosure,
or
the
plan,
or
appeals,
or
anything
to
protect
their
interest
in
this
case.
much
was
made
of
the
fact
that
we
have
tried
to
distinguish
under
6012
that
we
are
in
fact
not
within
the
definition
of
a
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11
of
the
united
states
code,
that
middle
section
that
the
government
says
makes
us
responsible.
in
fact,
what
it
is
is
exactly
as
mr.
jones
said.
it
was
a
technical
amendment.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1979,
section
6012
used
the
phrase,
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
which
had
a
very
defined
meaning
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
still
does
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
it
is
a
trustee
appointed
prior
to
confirmation
to
administer
the
estate.
in
fact,
when
6012
was
amended
it
was
in
fact
to
bring
the
language
into
line
with
the
language
used
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
it
means
today
exactly
what
it
meant
then...
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
herbert
stettin
an
assignee
is
someone
who
is
in
control
of
the
debtor,
who
has
hands-on
ability
to
determine
what
its
obligations
and
rights
are
and
to
control
it.
it
is,
in
fact,
something
other
than,
as
the
courts
below
used
in
this
case,
a
disbursing
agent
or
a
distributing
agent.
please
remember,
the
only
thing
that
the
liquidating
trustee
did
in
this
case
was
to
sell
the
property,
take
the
money,
and
pay
the
creditors
that
were
ordered
to
be
paid
by
the
court.
he
has
always
followed
out
the
terms
of
the
plan
which
say
you
will
pay
these
people.
mr.
herbert
stettin
justice
stevens,
you
are
correct.
in
fact--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--in
the
line
of
cases
that
have
in
fact
applied
6012(b).
there
are
at
least
30
or
40
cases
which
have
in
fact
interpreted
it.
mr.
herbert
stettin
on
a
scale
basis
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
did
and
did
not.
i
can
tell
you
that
of
the
ones
that
did,
every
one
of
those
were
an
instance
where
the
assignee
was
in
control
of
the
debtor
more
than
simply
having
possession
for
the
limited
purpose
of
conveying
it
to
a
third
person.
mr.
herbert
stettin
it
is,
and
if
they
had
in
fact
intended
that
it
cover
every
single
instance...
and
there
are
cases
that
say
it
does
not.
sonner,
as
an
example,
says
that
it
does
not
cover
a
grantor
trust.
mr.
herbert
stettin
the
case
is
still
open.
it
has
not
been
closed.
mr.
herbert
stettin
yes,
sir.
if
your
question
is,
do
i
know
of
any
instance
where
the
limitations
that
you
indicate
in
the
language
have
been
applied,
the
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
are
cited
in
the
brief,
by
the
way,
all
talk
in
terms
of,
if
you
are
the
equivalent
of
a
disbursing
agent.
in
re
alan
wood
comes
to
mind,
and
it's
cited
in
the
brief.
that
was
a
bankruptcy
act
case.
they
said
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
mere
disbursing
agent.
that's
the
reason
for
the
language
in
the
appeals
below,
which
said
that
we
are
the
equivalent
of
because
we
have
no
discretion.
that's
really
the
difference.
mr.
herbert
stettin
no.
a
disbursing
agent
defined
under
the
bankruptcy
act
in
fact
was
someone
who
was
supposed
to
receive
a
fund
of
money
only,
not
sell
property,
and
then
pay
it
out
in
accordance
with,
at
that
time,
a
confirmed
plan.
i
agree,
but
in
fact
the
courts
below--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--he
has
received
a
total
in
compensation
of,
i
believe...
i
could
be
off
by
a
little
bit...
of
about
$140,000
for
services
since
october
of
1985.
mr.
herbert
stettin
he
probably
regrets
having
been
lured
into
this,
but
that's
another
question
for
another
day.
i've
lost
my
train
of
thought,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
trying
to
think
of
another
instance
in
which
a
liquidating
trustee
with
duties
similar
to
our
trustee
would
not
have
the
responsibilities
of
a
typical
assignee,
and
i
can
think
of
one
other,
and
that's
a
commissioner
of
deeds.
that's
someone
who
was
appointed
to
carry
out
the
order
of
a
court
to
convey
property
where
there's
some
doubt
or
unwillingness
on
the
part
of
the
record
titleholder
to
carry
out
those
responsibilities.
this
trustee,
even
though
the
plan
clearly
gave
him
the
authority
to
operate
this
business,
never
operated
it.
he
sold
it
the
day
the
plan
became
effective.
that
fact,
it
seemed
to
me,
is
proof
positive
for
the
decisions
made
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
district
court,
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
all
of
whom
found
on
facts
that
his
discretion
was
minimal,
that
he
was
charged
only
with
these
limited
duties,
and
that
he
in
fact
was--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--you
can,
except--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--the
answer
i
give
you
is
because
otherwise
every
single
case
would
be
fact-driven.
in
fact,
in
this
case--
mr.
herbert
stettin
--i
agree
with
you
that
the
plan
circumscribes
what
his
responsibilities
are.
clearly,
i
cannot
avoid
that.
what
i
can
say
is,
if
he
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
filing
tax
returns,
as
the
government
argues,
if
he
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
filing
the
tax
return
for
consolidated
debtors,
as
they
say
in
this
case
he
was...
may
i
finish
my
response
to
your
question?
mr.
herbert
stettin
i
will
do
it
quickly.
then
he
would
have
had
to
obtain
information
from
a
number
of
nonfiled
debtors
in
order
to
file
that
consolidated
return,
and
obtain
information
from
a
debtor
which
our
brief
has
indicated
stoutly
resisted
every
effort
he
ever
made
to
get
fully
information.
he
would
not
know
what
to
put
in
the
return.
mr.
herbert
stettin
thank
you,
sir.
