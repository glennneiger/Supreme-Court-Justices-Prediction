justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
would
you
explain
to
me
whether
the
government
thinks
two
income
tax
returns
should
be
filed
for
this
period,
one
by
the
trustee
and
one
by
the
debtor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
should
the
individual
debtor
also
file
an
income
tax
return
for
the
same
period?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
he
have
to
show
any
of
this
transaction
on
his
personal
income
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
of
course
the
bankruptcy
estate
part
had
ended.
this
is
a
liquidation
trustee.
it's
no
longer
in
a
bankruptcy
estate,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
normal
bankruptcy
estate
is
over.
it's
in
liquidation,
and
it's
a
liquidation
trustee,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
the
trustee
and
only
the
trustee
in
liquidation
is
obliged
to
file
the
income
tax
return
for
the
period
in
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
the
government
is
relying
only
on
section
6012,
but
the
other
petitioners
rely
on
two
other
sections
as
well.
what's
your
position
on
those
two
other
sections?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
suppose
he
could
be
an
assignee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
fit
within
the
regulations
definition
of
assignee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
could
scoop
up
this
trustee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
just
to
be
absolutely
sure
the
government
gets
its
taxes
one
way
or
another.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
now
the
liquidating
trust
is
not
a
separate
taxable
entity,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
would
you
tell
me
what
you
respond
to
the
argument
made
by
your
colleague
to
the
effect
that
you
can't
take
the
dictionary
definition
of
assignee
in
6012(b)(3)
because
if
you
do
any
purchaser
of
the
assets
will
be
an
assignee?
