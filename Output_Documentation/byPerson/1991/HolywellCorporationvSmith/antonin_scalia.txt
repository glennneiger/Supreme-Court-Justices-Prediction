you
say
comfortably,
except
you
really
are
requiring
that
the
language
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11
be
applied
to
a
situation
in
which
the
case
under
title
11
is
completed.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
jones,
i
guess
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
whether
this
is
a
trustee
in
a
case
under
title
11
if
he's
an
assignee.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
on,
have
you
finished
your
discussion
of
assignee?
you
criticized
the
government
for
using
a
dictionary
definition.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
partial
to
dictionaries
myself.
why
isn't
the
dictionary
defenition
appropriate
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
the
government
had
notice
of
the
plan
here
and
could
have
objected,
blah,
blah,
blah.
that
happened
to
be
because
the
government
was
a
creditor.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
even
if
they
hadn't
been
a
creditor,
the
same
thing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
all
right,
and
they
would
have
gotten
the
same
notice
of
the
proposed
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
definition
of
assignee?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
congress
can
never
make
you
collect
taxes
you
don't
show
up
to
collect.
i
think
the
trustee
did
say
that
on
his
view
of
this
scheme
if
the
government
had
behaved
as
it
ought
to
have
when
it
got
notice
of
the
plan,
the
taxes
would
have
been
collected.
i
mean,
to
say
that
no
matter
what
happens
the
taxes
have
to
be
collected,
i
mean,
that's
just
not
true.
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
scheme
congress
sets
up,
you
can
destroy
it
by
not
doing
what
you're
supposed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
making
an
estoppel
argument,
but
i'm
saying
the
system
makes
sense.
it
does
not
leave
a
big
hole
in
which
the
government
will
not
collect
its
taxes.
it
makes
sense
on
the
assumption
that
the
government
had
done
what
it
was
supposed
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
also
don't
argue
for
the
dictionary
definition.
