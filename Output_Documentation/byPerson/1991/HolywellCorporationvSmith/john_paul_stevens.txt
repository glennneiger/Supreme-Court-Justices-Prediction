justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
it's
kind
of
a
broad
question
about
the
case.
we
have
before
us
the
bank,
and
we
have
the
debtor,
and
we
have
the
government.
are
there
any
general
creditors
out
there
who
are
going
to
be
affected
by
the
disposition
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
this
money
has
to
go
to
you,
it
has
to
come
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
general
creditors,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
anyone
representing
the
interests
of
the
general
creditors
filed
a
brief
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
may--
--one
question,
please.
but
would
they
keep
that
100
cents
on
the
dollar
if
you
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
possible
that
they
will
be
unpaid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
mr.
stettin,
assume
they
had
acted
with
due
diligence,
as
you
claim,
then
what
would
have
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
should
have
been
obvious
to
the
government
but
not
to
the
bank
or
to
the
debtor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
still
asking
you,
supposing
they
had
acted
with
due
diligence,
what
would
have
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
suggesting
the
government
should
be
solely
responsible
for
the
failure
to
discern
an
obvious
defect
in
the
plan,
even
though
neither
the
bank
nor
the
debtor
recognized
the
same
defect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
didn't
the
trustee
recognize
the
defect?
he
was
entitled
to
employ
a
counsel.
i
think
he
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
counsel,
if
i
remember
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
he
did
have
expensive
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
is
it
that
the
government
is
fully
responsible
for
an
error
that
a
lot
of
other
high-priced
lawyers
should
obviously
have
detected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
the
trustee
violate
any
term
of
the
plan
when
he
initiated
this
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
he
have
lawfully
initiated
this
litigation
the
day
after
he
was
appointed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
grantor
trusts
have
a
reporting
or
disclosure
obligation
as
opposed
to
a
filing
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
cases,
just
to
follow
mr.
jones'
last
point,
in
which
a
grantor
trust
was
created
by
a
debtor
in
possession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
the
decision
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
authority
you've
got.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask,
you
say
he
must
be...
have,
in
effect,
management
control
of
the
property,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
he
must
have
possession
or
hold
title
to
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
property
or
business
of
the
corporation,
and
he
does
meet
that
standard,
doesn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
do
we
find
the
legal
basis
for
your
suggestion
that
a
different
standard
should
apply
to
assignees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
held
that
assignees
were
liable.
how
many
of
those
held
the
assignee
was
not
an
assignee
within
the
meaning
of
this
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be
well
be,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
something
beyond
the
statutory
standard
is
required
in
order
to
qualify
as
an
assignee,
because
it
also
doesn't
say
order
of
court.
it's
or
otherwise.
it's
very
broad
language
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
your
grantor
trust,
but
this
is
a
case
where
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
still
alive.
i
guess
you
filed
this
complaint
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
mean,
and
that's
where
this
proceeding
initiated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but
you
needed
lawyers
and
tax
advisors
and
accountants,
and
you
were
going
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
for
your
professional
assistance,
your
trustee
was.
this
is
not
a
mere
disbursing
agent
in
the
normal
use
of
that
term.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
kind
of
compensation
did
this
trustee
get?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
exactly
a
bargain
assignment,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
obligation
to
pay
the
taxes
you're
describing
is
a
statutory
obligation,
not
one
created
by
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
paragraph
of
the
trust
gives
this
obligation...
places
obligation
on
the
trustee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
this
particular
tax
obligation
is
something
that
was
incurred
by
the
trustee
in
administering
the
trust.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
class
1
claims
are
defined
as
those
which
have
been
approved
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
administrative
claims
as
the
same
are
allowed
and
ordered
by
the
court,
is
what
it
says
on
page
38,
and
this
one
was
not
allowed
or
ordered
by
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
it
still
doesn't
fit
within
the
plain
language
of
the
plan,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
