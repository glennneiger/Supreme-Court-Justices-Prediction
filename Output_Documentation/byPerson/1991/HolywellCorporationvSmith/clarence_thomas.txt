justice
clarence
thomas
these
cases
come
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioners
holywell
corporation,
theodore
b.
gould,
and
several
affiliated
debtors
attempted
to
develop
a
hotel
and
office
building
in
miami,
florida.
after
encountering
financial
difficulties,
they
all
filed
chapter
11
bankruptcy
petitions.
in
a
consolidated
reorganization
plan,
they
agreed
to
place
their
assets
in
trust
and
to
have
a
trustee,
respondent
fred
stanton
smith,
distribute
their
property.
the
bankruptcy
court
declared
that
smith
did
not
have
to
pay
any
federal
income
tax
as
for
the
debtors
because
the
reorganization
plan
said
nothing
about
taxes.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
declaration.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
the
internal
revenue
code
ties
a
duty
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
to
the
duty
to
make
an
income
tax
return.
section
6012(b)(3)
of
the
code
requires
the
assignee
of
all
or
substantially
all
of
the
property
of
a
corporation
to
make
a
tax
return
for
the
corporation.
because
respondent,
smith,
meets
the
ordinary
definition
of
an
assignee,
he
must
make
a
return
and
pay
taxes
for
holywell
corporation
and
the
other
corporate
debtors.
smith
also
has
a
duty
under
section
6012(b)(4)
to
make
a
tax
return
as
a
trustee
of
a
trust.
he,
therefore,
has
to
pay
tax
on
the
income
earned
by
the
trust
property
attributable
to
debtor,
theodore
b.
gould.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
