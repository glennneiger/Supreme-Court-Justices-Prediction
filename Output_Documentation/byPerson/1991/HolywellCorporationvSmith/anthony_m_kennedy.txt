justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
the
answers.
what
are
the
tax...
the
only
taxable
entities
we
have
before
us
here,
the
corporation
and
the
individual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
other
areas
in
the
tax
law
where
there...
well,
let
me
preface
the
question.
does
the
individual
and
the
corporation,
do
they
also
have
the
obligation
to
file
a
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you
give
us
an
example
of
a
case
where
the
assignee
clause
of
(b)(3)
would
come
into
play
in
a
chapter
11
type
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
no,
i
want
a
definition
of
an
assignee.
you
wouldn't
call
a
debtor
in
possession
an
assignee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
so
that's
the
operative
phrase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
3713
does
not
apply,
what
does
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
507?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
don't
we
look
to
the
terms
of
the
plan
to
see
what
his
duties
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
don't
we
look
to
just
see
what
duties
he
performed
as
opposed
to
the
capacity
in
which
he
was
appointed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
just
the
opposite.
you're
the
one
that's
saying
we
should
look
at
what
he
did,
rather
than
what
the
document
says,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
look
at
the
nature
of
a
trustee,
we
look
to
the
instrument
which
creates
his
fiduciary
responsibilities.
