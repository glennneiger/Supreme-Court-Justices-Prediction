justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
is
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
permits
individual
citizens
to
sue
the
united
states
under
certain
circumstances
but
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
not
be
liable
for
punitive
damages.
in
this
case,
a
suit
was
brought
under
the
act
when
petitioner's
late
husband
suffered
severe
brain
damage
due
to
the
negligence
of
federal
employees.
although
some
damages
were
awarded,
the
courts
below
refuse
to
award
damages
for
the
husband's
future
medical
care
and
his
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
because
they
concluded
that
in
this
case,
such
damages
were
punitive
damages
barred
by
the
act.
in
an
opinion
on
file
in
the
court's
office
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case.
we
conclude
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
bars
the
recovery
only
of
what
are
considered
punitive
damages
under
traditional
common
law
principles.
at
common
law,
punitive
damages
generally
are
recoverable
only
upon
proof
that
the
defendant
has
engaged
in
egregious
or
intentional
misconduct
and
the
purpose
of
awarding
such
damages
is
to
punish
the
defendant.
the
damages
at
issue
in
this
case
do
not
fall
within
the
common
law
definition.
we
remand
the
case
for
the
lower
courts
to
consider
certain
issues
of
state
law
that
they
have
not
yet
addressed.
