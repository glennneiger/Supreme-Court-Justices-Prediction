justice
souter
mr.

xxx.
wouldn't
it
make
the
analysis
easier
if
you'd
said
there
are
three
categories
of
damages:
there
are
punitive
damages,
there
are
damages
for
pecuniary
loss,
and
then
there
are
damages
for
nonpecuniary
loss?
aren't
we
fighting...
we're
fighting
over
at
least
part
of
the
third
category
here.
you're
saying
there's
no
pecuniary
loss
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
argument
at
least,
or
doesn't
the
position
that
the
circuit
took
rest
on...
on...
on
sort
of
this,
i
think
improper
inference
that
because
punitive
damages
do
not
compensate
the
pecuniary
loss,
any
damages
which
do
not
compensate
the
pecuniary
loss
are
punitive?
and
if
we
reject
that
inference,
which
is
an
improper
inference,
then
we're...
we're
simply
thrown
back
on
the
definition
of
punitive
damage
that
your
brother
came
up
with,
and
he
says
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
nonpecuniary
loss
is
simply
determine
the
basis
upon
which
the
damage
is
awarded.
is
it
punishment
for
egregious
conduct,
or
isn't
it?
i
guess
my
question
is,
did
the
lower
court
make
the
improper
inference
that
i
have
just
imputed
to
it?
justice
souter
what's
the
difference
between
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
and
pain
and
suffering?
justice
souter
well,
you
wouldn't
claim
that
pain
and
suffering
damages
are
punitive.
justice
souter
all
right.
why...
why,
then,
are...
is
the
category
of
loss
of
enjoyment
punitive?
justice
souter
but
isn't
that
a
question
that
goes
to
the
definition
of
what
can
be
compensated
for
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life,
as
opposed
to
what
goes
to
what
is
punitive
and
nonpunitive?
you're
saying,
you
shouldn't
award
him
loss
for...
damages
for
loss
of
enjoyment
because
he'll
never
know.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
question
about
the
basis
in
state
law
on
which
those
damages
may
be
awarded,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
obviously
to
go
to
what
is
or
is
not,
or
whether
they
are
or
are
not
punitive
unless
you
expand
the
standard
definition
of
punitive
damages.
justice
souter
well,
but
the--
--the
manner
in
which
you
are
assuming
that
anything
which
is
not
compensatory
either
in
a
pecuniary
fashion
or
for
an
element
of
damage
which
the
patient
could
appreciate
is
necessarily
punitive.
i
mean,
your
whole
argument
rests
on
that
identification.
justice
souter
mr.
wright,
what
about
this
case?
a
state
decides
that
it
wants
to
cut
down
the
amount
of
sympathy
and
sort
of
cry-baby
damages
the
juries
award,
so
they
adopt
a
scheme
whereby
in
place
of
the
old
commonlaw
rule
all
damages
for
personal
injury
will
be
assessed
on
the
basis
of
what
the
reasonable
person
would
experience
as
damages
so
that
when
it
comes
time
for
pain
and
suffering
damages,
that
it
is
the
claim
of
a
reasonable
person
which
is
going
to
be
the
measure
of
damages.
and
in
a
given
case
a
government
driver
runs
over
my
foot,
and
the
claim
is
made
were
for
pain,
and
yet
you
could
prove
that
because
of
an
abnormality
in
my
nerves
i
have
no
sensation
down
there.
would
the
awarding
of
the
damages
be
punitive
for
the
pain
in
my
foot?
justice
souter
it
would
be
punative.
justice
souter
but
you
kind
of
invite
my
question.
i
mean,
just
a
little
bit
i
just
winced.
[laughter]
xxx
all
i
did
was
wince
and
walk
xxx.
would
you
have
to
shave
it
down
to
its
punative
element.
justice
souter
excuse
me,
was
the
government's
objection
to
the...
to
the
award
of
damages
on
that
point
not
only
based
upon
its
theory
of
what
is
punitive
but
also
on
state
law?
did
it
say
wisconsin
law
doesn't
allow
for
this
anyway?
