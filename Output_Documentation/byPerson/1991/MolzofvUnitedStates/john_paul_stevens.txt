justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
rottier?
you
said,
if
this
individual
had
been
in
a
private
hospital
rather
than
a
government
hospital,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
under
wisconsin
law
there
would
have
been
a
recovery
for
the
lost
medical
expenses,
the
large
amount
in
dispute.
but
it's
not
equally
clear,
is
it,
as
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law,
that
if
this
were...
case
were
tried
in
a
wisconsin
court
on
the
present
facts,
that
a
wisconsin
court
would
have
awarded
this
kind
of
potential
double
recovery?
justice
stevens
but
might
they
not
have
given
credit
for
the
full
amount
of
the
care
that
the
federal
government
is
going
to
give
to
this
individual?
justice
stevens
well,
how
can
you
be
so
sure
it
would
have
been
viewed
as
a
collateral
source?
this
is
not
an
insurance
case.
justice
stevens
--well,
you
don't
have
a
case
that
says
that,
though.
you
don't
have
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
in
the
particular
case
has,
before
the
verdict
come
in,
committed
itself
to
provide
all
of
the...
provide
the...
what
would
otherwise
be
paid
for--
justice
stevens
--and
it's
certainly
not
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility
that
the
wisconsin
court
would
say,
this
is
a
double
recovery,
it's
a
set-off.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
all
you
should
be
asking
for
is
to
have
us
send
the
case
back
to
decide
that
question
as
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law.
it
has
not
yet
been
decided,
as
i
understand
the
record
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
and
the
district
judge
certainly
didn't
decide
it
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
but
it's
certainly
not
a
frivolous
position,
when
the
family
seems
happy
with
the
government
service
it's
getting
in
the
future
to
say
the
government
shouldn't
have
to
pay
for
it
twice.
i
mean,
it's...
maybe
you're
right,
as
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law,
but
it
certainly
is
an
arguable
point,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
say
that?
the
statute
says,
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances,
but
shall
not
be
liable
for
interest
prior
to
judgment
or
for
punitive
damages.
the
only
exclusion
is
punitive
damages,
and
you
have
described
a
case
in
which
there
are
no
punitive
damages
under
common
law...
under
your
common
law
hypothesis,
right?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
if
we
assume
congress
meant
to
adopt
the
common
law
version
of
punitive
damages,
the
government
would
have
to
pay
just
like
any
private
party
would
in
that
situation,
wouldn't
they,
if
you
just
read
the
statute
literally,
and
if
you
interpret
punitive
damages
in
the
common
law
sense.
justice
stevens
well,
you
don't
agree
with
his--
justice
stevens
--understanding
of
the
common
law.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
at
least
in
this
paragraph
of
the
statute
the
word
"compensatory"
doesn't
appear?
justice
stevens
it
only
appears
in
the
death
action
section.
justice
stevens
supposing
you
had
a
situation
instead
of
your
double
recovery
where
you
had
a
no-fault
program
in
the
state
system
and
they
awarded...
they
set
precise
recoveries
for
different
kinds
of
injuries
like
you
do
under
workman's
compensation,
and
they
were
demonstrably
30
percent
higher
than
the
actual
compensation
required.
would
you
have
to
shave
off
the
excess
under
your
theory?
justice
stevens
say
you
have
a
no-fault
tort
program
in
which
the
amount
of
damages
for
different
kinds
of
injuries
are
set
by
statute,
as
they
are
in
the
workman's
compensation
program,
and
those
amounts
were
deliberately
set
by
the
legislature
at
maybe
25
or
30
percent
above
what
they
would
calculate
to
be
actual
damages,
to
add
a
little
deterrence
and
to...
and
to
take
care
of
possible
inflation,
one
thing
and
another.
they
just
fixed
them
a
little
high
at
the
start.
what
would
happen
under
such
a
statute
under
your
view?
would
part
of
that
be
punitive?
justice
stevens
--you
didn't
realize
how
stoic
these
new
england
yankees
are.
xxx.
on
what
basis
did
the
court
below
refuse
damages
for
loss
of
life
enjoyment
or
for
the
double
recovery?
