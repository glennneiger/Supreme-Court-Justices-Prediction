chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
90-838,
shirley
m.
molzof
v.
the
united
states.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rottier,
do
you
think
that
this
punitive
damages
exception
to
governmental
liability
under
the
act
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
which
requires
uniformity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
does
not
depend,
then,
on
the
law
of
the
particular
state
which
would
otherwise
govern
tort
liability?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
principle
of
wisconsin
law
is
it
that
leads
you
to
answer
that
question
the
way
you
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
judge
shabaz
actually
award
damages
here,
or
did
he
say
these
are
what
you
would
be
entitled
to
accept
for
the
punitive
damages
exception?
he
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
suggestions
made
by
my
colleagues
here
are
correct,
perhaps
whatever
problem
exists
could
be
remedied
simply
by
the
fact-finder,
the
awarder
of
damages
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
case,
if
in
fact
the
collateral
source
doctrine
as
applied
in
wisconsin
doesn't
squarely
cover
this
subject.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
not
that
this
comes
within
the
punitive
damages
exception,
but
that
perhaps
the
district
judge
sitting
in
madison
might
conclude
that
although
wisconsin
law
follows
the
collateral
source
doctrine,
this
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
a
collateral
source
question,
so
perhaps,
even
without
any
action
from
congress,
the
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
double
recovery.
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
actual
damages
imposed
in
a
state
which
follows
the
collateral
source
doctrine
were
compensatory?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
there's
a
double--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yeah,
okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rottier.
mr.
wright,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wright,
could
you
step
a
little
closer
to
the
microphone?
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
hearing
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if...
what
if
you
have
a
state
that
follows
the
normal
collateral
source
doctrine
and
you
subscribe
to
blue
cross,
the
blue
cross
covers
your
hospital,
your
hospital
bill
is
$
5,
000,
you're
entitled
to
recover
that
amount,
i
believe,
from
the
tort-feasor.
is
that,
in
your
view,
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
double
recovery
does
not
mean
it's
punitive.
double
payment
would?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
rottier,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rottier.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-838,
molzof
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
