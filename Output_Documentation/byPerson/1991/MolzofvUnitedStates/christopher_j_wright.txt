mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
first
to
discuss
some
general
principles
applicable
to
both
claims
in
this
case,
and
then
turn
to
petitioner's
claim
for
$
1,
300,
000
million
for
future
medical
care,
and
finally
to
the
claim
for
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life.
the
government's
basic
submission
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
tort
damages,
a
matter
that's
already
come
up...
punitive
and
compensatory.
we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
there
is
no
third
category
of
tort
damages
that
are
both
noncompensatory--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
know
of
no
state
that
defines
it,
that
has
a
third
category,
and
frankly
i
don't
think
opposing
counsel
was
able
to
come
up
with
a
third
category
today.
we
think
that
there
are
basically
only
two.
we
admit
that
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
calculate
tort
damages,
and
we
do
not
contend
that
compensatory
damages
need
to
be
made
with
a
sort
of
a
scientific
precision
that
is
impractical.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
sorry.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
let
me
make
a
number
of
points
in
response.
pecuniary
and
nonpecuniary
losses
are
normally
thought
of
as
subcategories
of
compensatory
losses.
we
do
not
argue,
and
i
don't
believe
the
lower
court
thought,
that
nonpecuniary
losses
are
always
noncompensatory.
let
me
add
that
a
future
medical
expense
award
is,
of
course,
a
pecuniary
sort
of
loss.
this
concern
i
think
goes
more
simply
to
the
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
award,
and
let
me
say
in
response
to
your
question,
finally
in
response
to
that,
we
do
not...
we
think
this
is
a
very
special
category
of
case
with
respect
to
the
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
issue.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
many...
courts,
states,
think
of
it
as
a
subcategory
further
of
pain
and
suffering.
some
courts
say
that
it
is
a
different
sort
of
nonpecuniary
but
compensatory
loss.
we
do
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
would
not
contend
that
pain
and
suffering
damages
are
punitive.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
only
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
mr.
molzof
was
never
aware
of
a
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
your
honor,
we
have
a
different
view
of
punitive
damages
than
does
petitioner.
as...
as
i've
said,
they
think...
we
all
agree
that
something
is
punitive
only
if
it
is
on
top
of
compensation.
they
would
contend
that
it
not
only
has
to
be
on
top
of
compensation
but
it
has
to
be
calculated
according
to
the
egregiousness
of
the
conduct
at
issue,
and
let
me...
let
me
say
in
response
to
that
that
we
think
the
following
hypothetical
shows
that
this
is
wrong.
if
this
were
a
case
where
there
was
undisputed
evidence
that
a
person,
an
employee
at
the
va
hospital,
had
maliciously
disconnected
the
respirator,
it
would
be
perfectly
clear...
everyone
would
agree...
that
the
united
states
could
not
be
subjected
to
punitive
damages
for
that
reason.
we
think
it
odd
to
argue
that
because
there
is
no
such
finding,
a
noncompensatory
award
may
be
added
on
top
of
the
compensatory
damages.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
with
respect
to
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life,
our
entire
argument
is
that
because
mr.
molzof,
under
these
unusual
circumstances,
never
had
any
appreciation
of
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life,
an
award
for
that
item
is
necessarily
noncompensable
and
hence
punitive.
but
let
me
stress
that
there
were
nonpecuniary
damages
awarded
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
challenge
them.
mrs.
molzof
received
$
150,
000
for
loss
of
consortium.
we
certainly
do
not
contend
that
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
a
seemingly
paradoxical
situation,
of
course.
typically,
the
more
severely
you
are
damaged,
the
greater
your
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
is,
and
the
greater
an
award
is
appropriate.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
not,
the
way
you
say
it,
because
i
assume
that
something
like
the
following
would
be
proposed
as
a
rationale.
this
is
a
sort
of
liquidated
damages,
if
you
will,
that
the
state
has
decided
that
it's
very
hard
to
approximate
exactly
what
compensation
is--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
think
that
as
a
general
matter,
that's
so.
we
think
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
it
is
so
clear
that
a
particular
award
is
not
compensatory,
and
we
have
two
of
those
situations
here,
that
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--certainly
not...
you
could
recover
here
certainly
if
a
state
said
that
for
the
reasons
i
outlined
that
it
needs
to
be
compensatory.
if
a
state
said,
i
think
that
we're
deterring
a
trespasser,
so
even
if
there's
no
damage
we're
going
to
award
$
5,
000,
that,
in
our
view,
would
be...
would
be
punitive.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor,
and
you
could
say
that
the
key
difference
there
is
that
in
that
situation
the
tort-feasor
is
not
required
to
pay
twice
for
the
same
injury.
in
this
situation...
and
we're
turning
now
to
the
$
1,
300,
000
million
for
future
medical
care...
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
government
will
both
pay
employees
at
the
va
hospital
to
provide
care
and
award
<one
point
three
million
dollars>
[=$
1,
300,
000]
million
on
top
of
that
to
provide
care.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
add,
as
well,
that
in
your
situation
double
recovery
would
not
occur
either.
blue
cross
has
a
very
strong
subrogation
policy
that
it
would
enforce.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
possible
that
subrogation
does
not
always
work
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
in
that
case--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
would
say...
well,
it's
a
timing
problem,
really.
the
tort-feasor
is
only
required
to
pay
once.
the
tort-feasor
has
harmed
the
victim
in
a
way
that
compensation
is
required,
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it...
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
first
payment
is
compensatory
and
the
second
payment
is
punitive.
as
between
the
tort-feasor
and
the
victim
we
think
that
state
law
has
reasonably
determined,
and
we
would
not
challenge,
that
we
will
just
look
at
the
relationship
of
the
tort-feasor
and
the
victim
and
require
the
tort-feasor
to
pay
for
the
damage
to
the
victim.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
a
first
payment
isn't.
the
question
is
what
to
do
with
the
third
party,
with
whom,
typically,
there's
a
separate
contract.
you've
contracted,
typically,
both
for
an
award...
in
case
you
are
damaged
you
not
only
get
compensation
but
you
get
the
benefit
you've
contracted
for
as
well.
that's
the
situation
in
that
case.
let
me...
let
me
pose
a
hypothetical,
if
i
may,
in
the
double
damage
issue.
if
a
state
decided,
perhaps
in
cases
where
serious
injuries
such
as
occurred
here
result,
that
it
will
award
double
damages
in
all
cases,
not
measured
by
egregiousness
or
maliciousness
or
any
sort
of
traditional
punitive
damage
or...
just
double
damages
in
all
case,
it
seems
to
us
under
petitioner's
theory
that
is
not
a
punitive
damage
award
under
section
2674.
we
think,
to
the
contrary,
such
an
award,
which
would
be
plainly
deterrent
in
purpose
and
effect
and
is
really
no
different
than
the
future
medical
award
in
this
case,
we
think
that
that
sort
of...
that
sort
of
damage
award
clearly
has
to
be
struck
down
under--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--under
petitioner's
view
that
punitive
damages--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
you
interpret
punitive
damages
to
mean
what
petitioner
says.
now,
in
the
common
law
sense,
i'd
like
to
say
that,
first,
an
element
of--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
an
element
of
agreement
has
actually
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
briefing
of
this
case.
we
now
all
agree,
and
it
was
stated
today,
that
punitive
damages
is
defined
according
to
federal
law.
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
mean
in
1946
when
it...
when
it
enacted
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
at
that
time,
of
course,
it
was
well
understood,
as
it
is
today,
that
the
purpose
of
tort
damages,
the
primary
purpose,
is
compensatory.
opposing
counsel
was
kind
enough
to
reference
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
mcdougald
case.
i
would
like
to
further
recommend
that
case.
it...
the
court
explains
in
some
detail
that
we
always
start
in
tort
cases
with
the
principle
that
compensation
is
the
goal,
not
punishment.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
that
congress
in
1946
understood
that
there
was
one
exception
to
the
rule
that
punitive
damages...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry...
that
compensatory
damages
are
the
purpose
for
awarding
damages
in
tort.
and
that
exception
was,
and
with
relatively
few
exceptions
continues
to
be,
that
the
occasion
for
departing
from
the
rule
is
when
the
behavior
of
the
tort-feasor
is
particularly
egregious.
in
1946,
i
think
congress
could...
would...
must
have
thought
courts
would
award
compensatory
damages
and
they
would
award
noncompensatory
damages
only
in
the
circumstances
where
there
was
a
judgment
of
maliciousness.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
sorry,
a
workers
compensation
award?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
would
think
in
the
general
case,
no,
our
position
is
not
that
compensation
can
be
and
must
be
awarded
exactly,
and
i
can
well
imagine
a
state
situation
that
we
would
not
challenge
where
a
damage
was
an
approximation,
as
most
nonpecuniary
damage
awards
are.
i
was
troubled
when
you
added
to
your
hypothetical
situation
where
a
state
intentionally
said
we're
going
to
add
25
percent
on
top
for
deterrent
effect.
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
in
that
situation,
yes,
the
add-on
for
deterrence
could
only
be
understood
as
being
punitive.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
the
unusual
case
that
you
suggest,
i
think
so.
i
would--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--until
you
got
to
the
point
where
you
said
that
it's
clear
that
you
suffer
absolutely
no
sensation
for
pain,
i
was
prepared
to
say,
oh,
that
sounds
like
the
sort
of
approximation
that,
frankly--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no.
i
think
that
under
our
view
we're
really
arguing
for
a
narrow
position
today
that
if
you
suffered
some
pain
and
there
is
a
statutory
award
that
is
a
reasonable
compensatory
approximation
of
a
normal
person's
pain,
i
don't
think
we
would
challenge
that.
if--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
you
suffered
no
pain
whatever,
as
mr.
molzof
suffered
no
cognition
of
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life,
we
would
say
yes,
it
can
only
be
punitive.
it's
not
at
all
compensatory.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
both
circumstances,
the
court
went
past
the
question
of
wisconsin
law
and
held
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
punitive...
that
such
awards
would
be
punitive
under
2674,
in
the
one
case,
because
it
would
require
the
united
states
to
pay
twice.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
add
in
this
respect
that
of
course
there's
no
state
law
question
before
the
court.
it
did
come
up
while
the
petitioner
was
presenting
his
views.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
would
be
left
over.
let
me
just
note
briefly,
though,
that
there
are
very
few
circumstances
in
which
the
states
have
authorized
damages
awards
that
we
would
challenge
as
punitive.
and
here,
for
instance,
there
is
no
authority
that
wisconsin
would
allow
a
double
recovery
in
a
situation
where
the
tort-feasor
has
to
pay
twice,
and
there
is
no
wisconsin
authority
for
damages
for
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
by
a
person
in
a
permanently
comatose
state.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
narrower.
i
hope
you
won't
think
it's--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--less
logical
in
this
respect.
we
contend
that
it
is...
it
was
mrs.
molzof's
choice
where
mr.
molzof
would
be
treated.
if
she
had
intended
to
move
him
elsewhere,
she
then
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
award
for
future
medical
damages.
in
that
situation,
the
government
would
not
have
been
required
to
pay
twice.
it
would
not
have
been
required
to
pay
federal
employees
to
care
for
mr.
molzof
as
well
as
to
pay
the
tort
damage
award.
in
that
situation,
also,
mrs.
molzof
would
not
have
been
recompensed
twice.
she
would
have
taken
the
money
and
paid
a
private
hospital
to
care
for
mr.
molzof.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we're
objecting
to
paying
the
money
on
top
of
the
va
services.
and
those
courts
of
appeals
that
have
said
that
the
ulrich
and
feeley
cases
where
the
courts
have
said
that
it
is
the
choice
of
the
victim's
family
as
to
where
he
is
treated,
we
agree
absolutely
that
it
is
the
victim's
choice.
here,
however,
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
other
hospital
in
the
vicinity
that
could
provide
comparable
care,
and
it
was
clear
that,
indeed,
mrs.
molzof
did
not
intend
to
move
mr.
molzof,
and
in
fact
he
was
cared
for
in
the
va
hospital
until
he
died.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think...
i
think
he
gets
the
same.
i
think--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--oh,
yes.
whatever...
whatever
the
normal...
lost
earnings,
or
any
losses--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
any
pain
and
suffering.
under
a
survival
statute
you
would
get
any
pain
and
suffering
he
suffered
before
entering
the
personal
comatose
state.
and
again,
we're
not
challenging
any
of
those
sorts
of
awards
here
today.
again,
let
me
stress
that
we...
we
recognize
that
sometimes
it's
difficult
to
approximate
particularly
nonpecuniary
damage
awards,
but
in
two
situations
we
think
that
it's
very
clear
that
damages
are
noncompensatory
and
punitive,
and
those
circumstances
are
where
the
tort-feasor
has
to
pay
twice,
and
where
the
tort-feasor
is
required
to
make
a
payment
for
an
inherently
noncompensable
loss.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
