justice
white
well,
you
seem
to
have...
if
you
get
you
want,
you
seem
to
concede
that
there
would
be
a
double
recovery.
justice
white
well,
you'd
be...
you'd
be
being
paid
for
something
that
you're
not
out
of
pocket
for.
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
and
yet...
and
yet
you
say
that
every...
every
dollar
you
want,
you
would
categorize
as
compensatory?
justice
white
well,
what
is
it
if
it
isn't
compensatory
or
punitive?
justice
white
what
do
you
call
that?
justice
white
so
i
suppose
you
would
lose
if
we
concluded
that
anything
that
is
not
compensatory
is
punitive?
justice
white
well
isn't
the
definition
of
punitive
damages
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
white
i
mean,
what
punitive
damages
means
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
white
and
if
the
federal
law
is
that
anything
that
isn't
compensatory
is
punitive--
justice
white
--yeah.
yeah.
and
so
we
get
back
to
whether
or
not
what
you
want
is
compensatory?
justice
white
we
aren't...
we
aren't...
we
aren't
required
to
follow
state
law
in
defining
punitive
damages?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
is
that...
is
there
doubt
about
that
under
wisconsin
law?
justice
white
i
see.
you
don't
have
any
case
allowing
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
where
the
patient
is
comatose
and
likely
never
to
recover?
justice
white
well,
i--
justice
white
--i
suppose
if
someone
loses
an
arm,
he
can
recover
damages
for
having
lost
an
arm
even,
though
he
never
well
have
the
chance
of
using
that
arm
at
all?
justice
white
you
don't
think
there
is
under
any
state
law
that
you
know
of?
justice
white
and
you
wouldn't
be
challenging
this,
if...
except
that
the...
if
the
patient
weren't
in
a
vegetative
state.
justice
white
so
that
was
essentially
a
construction
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
that
means
that
the
government
shouldn't
be
held
to
the
definition
of
punitive
damages
of
common
law?
justice
white
well,
but
it
certainly
would
be
left
over
if
we
didn't
agree
with
you
on
the
reach
of
punitive
damages.
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that?
justice
white
citation?
