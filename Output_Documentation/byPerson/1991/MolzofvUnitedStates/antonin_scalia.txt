justice
scalia
well,
except...
except
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
you
treat
the
government
as
an
individual
citizen
except
with
respect
to
punitive
damages.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
sort
of
begging
the
question
when
you
say
you
have
to
treat
the
government
the
same
way
you
treat
everybody
else.
you
don't
with
respect
to
punitive
damages.
justice
scalia
mr.
rottier,
i
suppose
you're
just
arguing
that
this
is
governed
by
state
law,
right,
and
if
a
state
chose
not
to
allow
double
recovery,
then
there
wouldn't
be.
is
that
so,
or
not?
justice
scalia
but
this
is
not
just
a
state-paid
benefit,
i
think
that's
the
point
that's
being
made.
it
is
state-paid,
and
yes,
that's
a
collateral
source,
but
this
is
a
defendant-paid
benefit,
as
well.
that's
the
distinctive
thing,
and
you
don't
know
of
any
defendant-paid
cases.
justice
scalia
that
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
wisconsin
to
do,
let's
agree
with
you.
but
if
it's...
if
it's...
i
mean,
if
it's
state
law,
it's
state
law.
you're...
you're
talking
to
the
wrong...
to
the
wrong--
justice
scalia
but
it's
only
a
serious
problem
in
those...
states
that
choose
to
make
it
a
serious
problem.
i
mean,
it
is
a
serious
problem
where
a
state
would
allow
the
double
recovery,
and
that's
what
we
don't
know
is
the
situation
here.
it
may
not
be
a
problem
in
wisconsin.
what
were
those
other...
those
other
cases,
did
they
involve
wisconsin
law,
or
the
law
of
other
states?
justice
scalia
mr.
rottier,
suppose
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
punitive
damages
point
but...
but
disagree
with
you
on
the...
on
the
duplicative
damages
point,
or
at
least
not
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is
because
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law,
what
ought
our
judgment
to
be?
in
other
words,
suppose
we
agree
that
even
though
it's
noncompensatory
it
is
recoverable
so
long
as
it
is
not
punitive
damages
in
the...
in
the
generally
understood
common
law
sense,
okay?
but
suppose
we
further
say
we
don't
know
what
the...
what
the
wisconsin
law
is
as
far
as
recovering
judgment
from
the
same
defendant
for
damages
that
he's
already
paying
in
some
other
capacity.
what
should
we
do
with
the
case,
if
that's
how
we
come
out?
you
lose,
or...
i
mean,
or
what?
what
happens?
justice
scalia
well,
is
there...
is
there
the
same
doubt...
you
have
another
claim
for
a
different
type
of
damages,
the
loss
of
life
enjoyment?
justice
scalia
mr.
wright,
suppose
you
have
a
state
statute
that
says,
for
all
trespasses
the
trespasser
shall
be
liable
for
the
owner
of
the
property
for
five...
for
$
5,
000,
and
the
government
somehow
is...
is
sued
under
the
tort
claims
act
on
a
trespass.
what
result?
that's
punitive
damages,
in
your
estimation?
justice
scalia
so
whatever
the
state
thinks
is
compensation
is
good
enough?
justice
scalia
maybe
the
state
here
thinks
that,
you
know,
that
this
is...
for
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
they
might
deem
it
compensatory.
i
mean,
i
don't
know...
it
seems
to
me
it
clearly
isn't
compensatory.
if
you
say
$
5,
000,
just
a
spot
number...
$
5,
000
for
everything,
you
could
recover
on
that
but
you
can't
recover
here?
justice
scalia
i
thought
some
states
don't
allow
that.
i
thought
some
states
have
laws
that
if
you
recover
you
can...
you
can
get
your
insurance
and
the
recovery
both.
that
would--
justice
scalia
--right,
and
in
that
case,
would
you
consider
those
punitive
damages?
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that...
that
bears
no
relationship
to
whether
it's
compensatory
or
not.
whether
one
person
pays
once
or
twice
doesn't
make
it
compensatory
or
noncompensatory.
compensation
is
determined
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
recipient,
not
the
donor,
and
you've
accepted
a
case
where
the
donor
is
clearly
getting
the
money
twice
and
yet
you
say
that
is
not
punitive.
that
is
not
a
punitive
award,
but
somehow
in
this
case
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
quite
illogical.
justice
scalia
well,
i
agree
that
punitive
is
looked
at
from
the...
from
the
standpoint
of
the
person
that
pays,
but
you
say
everything
is
punitive
that
is
not
compensatory,
and
yet
you
accept
the
chief
justice's
example
of
something
that
is
clearly
not
compensatory,
and
for
some
reason
you
say
that
that
is
not
punitive.
and
i
don't
see
why.
justice
scalia
the
narrower
it
gets
the
less
logical
it
gets.
that's
the
only--
justice
scalia
well,
mr.
wright,
it's
not
really...
i
don't
think
it's
really
paying
twice.
i...
suppose,
you
know,
the
government
comes
up
and
says,
we'll...
you'll
sign
a
medical
contract
with
us
and
we'll
give
you
your
medical
services
at
80
percent
of
cost,
but
you
have
to
go
to
a
government
hospital
and
take
our
doctors.
now,
i'm
not
sure
you'd
accept
that.
i'm
not
sure
i
would.
i
like
to
go
to
what
doctor
i
want
and
buy
services
where
i
want.
what
you're
saying
is,
because
you
have
volunteered...
the
government
has
volunteered...
to
provide
to
this
individual
services
in
a
veterans
administration
hospital,
he's
going
to
have
to
get
the
services
there,
whether
he
likes
it
there
or
not.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
so
you're
really...
you're
really
not
objecting
to
paying
the
money,
you're
objecting
to
providing
the
va
services,
or,
i
mean,
one
or
the
other?
