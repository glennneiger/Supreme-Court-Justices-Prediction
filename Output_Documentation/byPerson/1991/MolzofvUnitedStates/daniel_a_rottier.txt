mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
the
court
today
in
this
case
relates
to
the
definition
of
punitive
damages
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
federal
tort
claim
act.
the
basic
structure
of
the
federal
tort
claim
act
is
premised
on
three
features.
the
first
is
that
in
these
cases
the
united
states
is
to
be
treated
as
would
a
private
individual
if
it
were
a
defendant
in
a
tort
claim.
the
second
feature
is
that
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
tort
occurred
is
to
be
applied,
and
the
third
feature
is
that
certain
exceptions
are
engrafted
in
the
law.
one
of
those
exceptions,
namely
the
punitive
damage
exception,
is
the
one
that
the
court
is
concerned
with
today.
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
government's
definition
of
punitive
damages
is
to
be
accepted
as
it
was
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit,
it
would
emasculate
the
objectives
of
the
federal
tort
claim
act,
because
it
would
result
in
the
government
not
being
treated
as
would
an
individual
citizen
if
the
individual
citizen
were
the
defendant,
and
that's
the--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--i
believe
the
definition
of
punitive
damages
as
used
in
the
exclusionary
clause
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
that's
correct,
but
i...
but
i
believe
the
federal
interpretation
should
bear
in
mind
the
other
objectives
of
the
act,
one
of
which
is
to
treat
the
government
as
an
individual
citizen
would
be
treated
if
it
were
a
defendant.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
the
approach
i
would
suggest
is
the
one
used
by
the
this
court
in
the
neustadt
case,
where
the
issue
was
how
to
define
misrepresentation,
since
that
is
also
an
excluded
basis
of
liability
for
the
government,
and
there
what
the
court
did
was
to
look
at
the
commonly
accepted
definition
of
misrepresentation
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
federal
tort
claim
act
was
enacted.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
should
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
punitive
damages.
and
what
i
believe
the
court
would
find
is
there
was
general
consensus
among
the
writers
and
among
the
courts
as
to
what
punitive
damages
are,
and
the
definition,
for
example,
that
was
used
by
this
court
in
the
milwaukee
railroad
case
going
back
to
1875
focuses
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
as
opposed
to
the
effect
of
the
receipt
of
the
damages
by
the
plaintiff.
i
think
that's
where
the
flannery
court
and
the
molzof
court
deviated
from
an
appropriate
approach
to
this
problem.
they
focused
on
the
effect
of
the
receipt
of
the
award
on
the
plaintiff,
as
opposed
to
focusing
on
the
basis
of
imposing
the
award.
in
this
case,
one
might
ask
this
question:
would
mr.
molzof
have
been
entitled
to
future
medical
expenses
if
the
defendant
were
a
private
hospital
instead
of
a
veterans'
hospital?
the
answer
is
absolutely
clear,
under
wisconsin
law,
that,
yes,
he
would
have
been.
and
then,
to
remain
in
keeping
with
the...
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
act,
the
government
should
be
treated
the
same,
unless...
unless
the
basis
for
awarding
these
is
the
basis
on
which
punitive
damages
are
normally
awarded.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
under
traditional
wisconsin
common
law
in
tort
cases,
if
a
plaintiff
can
show
that
the
negligence
of
a
defendant
was
a
substantial
factor
contributing
to
the
need
for
future
medical
expenses,
those
are
awardable.
in
some
instances,
they're
subrogated
to
someone
who
has
paid
them.
that
much
is
true.
in
this
case,
for
example,
this
entire
problem
that's
presented
could
easily
be
remedied
by
congress.
if
congress
had
approached
the
federal
tort
claims
act
as
strictly
a
compensation
act
and
defined
what
elements
of
compensation
were
to
be
included,
it
would
be
much
more
easily
applied.
or,
if
it
wanted
to
avoid
this
type
of
situation,
it
could
have
enacted
a
set-off
procedure,
just
as
it
did
for
disability
benefits
under
38
u.s.c.
351...
and
the
court
i
am
sure
is
familiar
with
that.
if,
for
example,
a
veteran
is
malpracticed
upon
and
it
causes
an
increase
in
disability
benefits,
the
government,
pursuant
to
section
351,
suspends
payment
of
the
previously
enacted
and
previously
ordered
disability
payments
so
that
a
double
payment
does
not
result.
that
is
what
two
of
the
circuits
have
recommended
to
congress
over
the
years,
in
the
feeley
case
in
1964
and
in
the
ulrich
case.
in
both
of
those
instances...
those
are
the
only
two
circuit
cases
before
molzof
where
this
particular
issue
was
presented...
both
of
those
circuits
said
that
they
were
uncomfortable
with
the
potential
of
a
double
recovery,
but
that
the
resolution
of
that
problem
was
for
congress,
not
for
the
courts.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
that's
correct.
if,
for
example...
and
i
think
it
is...
this
problem
can
be
dealt
with
through
state
law,
if
for
example
a...
under
state
law
a
particular
type
of
compensatory
damage
is
deemed
to
be
excessive,
then
it
can
be...
then
it
is
certainly
not
awarded.
in...
if
we
took
flannery,
for
example,
which
gave
rise
to
this
discussion
generally,
where
you
had
a
comatose
individual,
where
$
1,
300,
000
was
awarded
for
that,
the
federal
court
could
merely
have
addressed
that
issue
on
the
basis
of
excessiveness.
if
it
thought...
if
the
circuit
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
felt
that
under
the
state
law
such
damages
were
awardable,
it
could
have
diminished
them
on
the
basis
of
excessiveness.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
that's...
you're
correct
on
both
points.
the
judge
did
not
award
damages.
the
judge
made
a
finding
as
to
what
they
would
be
were
they
not
prohibited
and
did
they
not
fall
within
the
exclusion
as
being
punitive
damages,
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
to
the
contrary.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
finder
of
fact
in
such
a
situation,
which
would
have
been
a
jury,
would
have
had
to
address
the
very
same
questions
of
duration
of
mr.
molzof's
life,
and
the
reasonable
amount
of
the
future
medical
expenses,
but
they
would
have
been
awarded.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
under
wisconsin
law,
that
would
have
been
viewed
as
a
collateral
source,
and
that
would
not
have
been
factored
in
with
respect
to
the
award
of
future
damages.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
in
wisconsin,
and
partly
from
experience,
in
wisconsin
governmental
benefits
are
viewed
as
a
collateral
source.
however,
with
respect
to
both
state-of-wisconsin-paid
benefits
as
well
as
certain
federal
benefits
there
is
subrogation
for
past
expenditures,
but
there
is
no
statutory
subrogation
for
wisconsin-paid
benefits
for
in
the
future.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
it
does
affect
eligibility
under
wisconsin
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
know
of
no
such
arrangements.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
have
been,
because
it
would
compel--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--the
way
the
set-off
provisions
work
in
wisconsin
with
respect
to
state-paid
benefits
is
that
the
receipt
of
an
award
for
future
medical
expense
affects
eligibility.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
none
that
have
been
reported.
there's
a...
there's
an
issue
that's
starting
to
arise
relating
to
health
maintenance
organizations
and
attempts
to
subrogate
them
for
future
medical
expenses,
but
those
have
not
been
reported.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
members
of
the
court,
is
that
this
is
a
problem
which
is
very
easily
remedied
by
congressional
action
or,
in
fact,
by
action
by
the
veterans
administration,
because
all
that
needs
to
be
done
is
that
eligibility
for
future
veterans'
benefits
is
affected
by
receipt
of
an
award
for
future
medical
expense,
just
as
they
did
with
section
351
by
affecting
eligibility
for
future
disability
payments
once
a
veteran
has
received
an
award
pursuant
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
think
the
deficiency
in
that
approach,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
it
will
require
federal
courts
to
evaluate
each
and
every
element
of
compensatory
damages
and
address
the
effect
of
their
receipt
on
the
plaintiff,
instead
of
focusing
on
what
i
think
is
the
more
appropriate
question,
which
is,
on
what
basis
is
an
award
being
made.
is
it
on
the
basis
of
negligence
which
is
compensable,
or
is
it
on
the
basis
of
more
egregious
conduct
which
rises
to
the
level
of
that
which
would
support
punitive
damages?
it's
an
award
based
on
that
type
of
conduct
which
is
prohibited.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
some
courts
in
fact
have
used
that
approach
with
respect
to
medical
expenses
paid
by
the
government
prior
to
trial.
indeed,
in
this
case,
no
claim
was
made
for
past
medical
expenses
incurred
prior
to
trial
because
of
the
concern
raised
in
those
federal
courts,
including
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
green
case.
however,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
you
force
the
fact-finder...
by
finding
that
this
is
the
only
source
of
medical
care
the
plaintiff
will
use
for
the
balance
of
his
or
her
life,
you
essentially
force
the
fact-finder
to
make
that
plaintiff
a
life-long
prisoner
of
that
health
care
provider,
whoever
it
may
be.
if
we
stepped
outside
of
the
veterans
administration
for
the
moment
and
said
this
were
a
private
hospital--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--well,
i
very
much
agree
with
you.
if
it's
state
law,
it's
state
law,
and
that's
what
i'm
asking
be
applied
here.
state
law
in
wisconsin
would
allow
an
award
of
future
medical
expense,
irrespective
of
any
future
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
private
insurance
company
or
the
government
to
make
payment
for
those
medical
expenses.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
have
no
such
case--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--i
know
of
no
case,
your
honor,
that...
where
a
defendant...
a
private
defendant
has
come
in--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--nor
does
the
government
know
of
any
such
case,
at
least
as
reflected
by
its
brief,
and
it
would
strike
me--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--i'm
not
contending
it's
a
frivolous
position.
what
i
am
contending
is
that
this
very
issue,
as
serious
as
it
is,
was
raised
in
the
feeley
and
the
ulrich
courts,
and
both
of
them
said,
this
is
a
serious
problem,
congress
should
remedy
it.
congress
has
chosen
not
to
remedy
it,
even
though
it
took
care
of
the
double
payment
potential
with
respect
to
disability
benefits,
and
it
took
care
of
it
very
simply
in
38
u.s.c.
351.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
it
was
the
law
of
other
states.
one
was
pennsylvania
and
the
other
new
york,
and
then
there
are
lower
court
decisions
in
connecticut
and
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
which
followed
the
same
principle.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
don't
necessarily
concede
that,
but
what
it
would
do...
i
concede
it
creates
the
potential.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
concede
there
is
that
potential.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
concede
there
is
that
potential,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--every
dollar
we're
requesting
i
would
categorize
as
nonpunitive,
and
if
it
is
nonpunitive,
it
falls
outside
the
exclusion.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
well,
as
the
court
knows--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--as
the
court
knows,
there's
been
much
written
about
those
two
components
and
whether
they're
totally
mutually
exclusive
or
not.
if
you
look
at
them
from
the
perspective
of
the
basis
on
which
they're
awarded--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--yes,
but
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
approach.
i
think
the
approach
would
be
from
the
perspective
of
what
is
the
basis
on
which
the
damages
are
being
awarded,
because
that
was
how
punitive
damages
were
defined
traditionally
at
the
time
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
imposed.
it's
those
damages
which
were
imposed
because
of
the
egregious
conduct
of
the
defendant.
it
was--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--they
are
compensatory
even
in
circumstances
where
they're--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--where
they're
duplicative.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
they
remain
compensatory
because
the
basis
on
which
they
were
awarded
was
simple
negligence,
as
opposed
to
some
higher
level
of
egregious
conduct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
it
is--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
lose.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i'd
like
to
just
take
a
half-step
back,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
that's
why
it's
so
important
that
the
court,
in
deciding
the
definition
of
punitive
damages,
look
to
the
traditional
common
law
definition,
and
it
hinged,
as
far
as
i
know,
on
the
nature
of
the
defendant's
conduct.
that's
a--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--not
with
respect
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
but
i
think
the
precedents
of
this
court
are
clear
as
to
what
punitive
damages
are
both
in
the
context
of
the
federal
tort
claim
act
as
well
as
in
the
broader
context,
going
back
to
the
1800's.
it's
based
on...
it
has
not
been
defined...
punitive
damages
have
not
been
defined
by
this
court
as
those
which
are
not
compensatory.
it
was
defined
as
those
which
are
to
be
awarded
to
punish
and
deter
egregious
conduct
of
the
defendant.
and
those
damages
were
never
sought
in
this
case,
and
they
would
not
have
been
available
under
wisconsin
law
even
if
the
punitive
damage
exclusion
provision
were
not
in
the
federal
tort
claim
act.
the
other
problem
with
the
approach
taken
by
judge
shabaz
in
the
seventh
circuit
is
that
it
resulted
in
an
unworkable
situation.
essentially,
judge
shabaz...
and
you
may
recall
at
the
end
of
his
decision
from
the
bench,
i
asked
him
if
he
were
giving...
granting
the
equivalent
of
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
veterans
administration
to
provide
the
same
level
of
care,
and
he
said
that
the
court
would
retain
jurisdiction
and
would
monitor
the
situation
and
be
available
for
interim
relief.
the
court
went
on,
however,
to
find
that
there
were
deficiencies
in
the
veterans
administration
care
and
awarded
$
25,
000
a
year
so
that
the
family
could
bring
in
an
outside
physician,
outside
physical
therapists,
outside
respiratory
therapists,
and
supplement
the
care
in
the
respects
in
which
it
was
deficient.
that
is
an
unworkable
situation.
essentially
what
he
said
is,
all
future
damages
for
medical
care,
other
than
$
25,
000
a
year,
are
noncompensatory
and
thus
punitive,
but
he
conceded
that
at
least
to
the
extent
of
$
25,
000,
compensatory
damages
were
justifiable.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
don't
lose
until
a
decision
is
made,
but
one
option
is
to...
i
assume,
to
certify
it
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
to
answer
that
question,
if
you're
uncomfortable
with
the
status
of
wisconsin
law
on
that
issue.
i'm
of
the
belief
that
wisconsin
law
would
allow
such
recovery,
albeit
that
no
such
specific
case
has
been
presented
in
wisconsin.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
yes.
a
claim
was
brought--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--there
is
doubt
about
that
under
wisconsin
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
series
of
cases
of
longstanding
that
allows
compensation
for
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life,
but
none
of
those
fact
situations
focused
on
a
situation
where
the
plaintiff
was...
was
comatose,
and
totally
unaware
of
his
or
her
condition.
that
is
an
undecided
issue
under
wisconsin
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
there
have
been
trial
court
decisions,
but--
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
--well,
the...
obviously
the
side
of
the
argument
that
i
prefer
is
the
one
that
no
awareness
of
a
loss
is
needed
if
an
objective
analysis
can
be
made
that
a
loss
did
occur
and
that
some
reasonable
value
can
be
affixed
to
it.
on
the
other
hand,
perhaps
the
best
discussion
of
the
need
for
some
conscious
awareness
is
in
the
mcdougald
case
out
of
new
york
state,
which
actually
followed
rufino,
and
in
that
case...
and
i
may
be
arguing
the
government's
point
here...
in
that
case
there
was
a
threshold
requirement
that
there
be
some
minimal
awareness
of
the
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life,
and
once
that
threshold
requirement
was
met,
then
damages
for
that
component
were
awardable.
your
honors,
in
summary,
before
i
sit
down
and
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal,
what
i'm
asking
is
that
the
court
look
at
the
statute
itself.
the
statute
is
very
clear
in
the
sense
of
wanting
to
apply
state-by-state
law.
yes,
that
results
in
a
sometimes
awkward
situation
because
of
variances
from
state
to
state,
but
that
is
the
intended
structure
of
the
act.
and
to
follow
the
government's
reasoning
in
this
case
will
reduce
the
effect
of
that
provision
and
fly
in
the
face
of
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
that
provision.
i
reserve
the
balance.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court,
there
was
proof
at
the
trial
level
that
three
other
hospitals,
including
the
hospital
in
the
home
town
of
mrs.
molzof...
boscobel,
wisconsin...
would
take
this...
the
injured
veteran.
moreover,
the
suggestion
that
mrs.
molzof
should
have
taken
him
from
the
veterans
hospital
before
the
case
was
tried
to
evidence
her
intent
overlooks
the
fact
the
cost
of
care
is
approximately
$
400,
000
per
year,
and
there
was
testimony
she
had
limited
resources.
so
that
should
not
be
the
determinative
factor
here.
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
issues
raised
with
justice
kennedy,
i
think
under
the
new
york
regime
the
only
difference
between
damages
for
a
fully
comatose
individual
versus
someone
who
had
died
would
be
the
future
cost
of
care,
which
obviously
wouldn't
be
necessary.
the
impairment
of
future
earning
capacity
would
likely
be
the
same,
i
would
expect,
under
the
mcdougald
approach.
the
attorney
for
the
government
came
very
close
to
agreeing
that
they
were
not
objecting
to
paying
the
money,
but
they
were
objecting
to
the
continuation
of
free
medical
care
under
mr.
molzof's
entitlement
as
a
disabled
veteran.
i
suggest
there
is
a
very
easy
solution
to
that,
and
this
is
the
wrong
branch
of
government
for
it.
it
merely...
it
can
come
from
the
veterans
administration;
it
can
come
from
congress.
they
merely
suspend
eligibility
for
the
underlying
benefits
and
require
the
veteran
to
expend
the
dollars
which
have
been
awarded
at
his
or
her
choice,
whether
in
a
private
facility
or
whether
in
a
government
facility.
but
in
either
case
they
will
be
expended,
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
will
be
complied
with,
and
that
is
the
much
cleaner
approach.
each
time
you
try
to
focus
on
whether
the
effect
of
receipt
of
compensatory
damages
is
punitive
or
not,
you
get
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
quagmire.
it's
much
easier
to
step
back
and
say,
what
is
the
justification
for
punitive
damages?
if
the
justification
is
to
punish,
and
it's
based
on
the
nature
of
the
conduct,
then
it
is
not
awardable
because
it
falls
within
the
prohibition
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
i
might
mention
in
response
to
justice
souter's
questions
about
conscious
pain
and
suffering
and
such,
the
state
of
the
law
in
wisconsin
is
that
conscious
pain
and
suffering
is
compensable,
but
not...
there
is
no
such
entity
as
unconscious
pain
and
suffering.
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
is
viewed
as
a
component
of
pain
and
suffering.
the
narrow
issue
that's
undecided
in
wisconsin
is
whether
a
comatose
individual
who
cannot
exhibit
an
awareness
of
loss
of
enjoyment
of
life
should
be
compensated
for
that
component.
there
was
no
effort
made
in
this
case
to
seek
an
award
for
conscious
pain
and
suffering.
we
took
the
position
that
we
did
not
have
the
evidence
to
support
that,
and
it
was
not
available
under
wisconsin
law,
even
though
some
states
might
in
fact
have
allowed
that.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
the
government
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
wisconsin
law
did
not
allow
it.
they
did
take
a
position
wisconsin
law
was
silent
on
it
and
that
the
primary
argument
was
that
it
would
be
punitive.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
i
agree
with
the
government's
counsel
that
the
basic
approach
of
both
the
trial
judge
and
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
both
of
these
components
of
damages
resulted
in
the
punitive
effect
and
therefore
was
prohibited
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
in
closing,
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
the
massachusetts
bonding
case
which
did
relate
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
did
require
the
supreme
court
to
look
at
the
definition
of
punitive
damages.
that
involved
a
massachusetts
wrongful
death
statute
which
said
that
if
someone
was
killed
their
survivors
could
make
a
claim
for
wrongful
death,
but
it
had
to
fall
within
a
certain
minimum
and
maximum
irrespective
of
what
pecuniary
damages
had
been
sought.
what's
the
name
of
the
case,
mr.
rottier?
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
massachusetts
bonding.
it's
a
1956
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
rottier
352
u.s.
128,
and
in
that
case
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
held
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
follow
these
minimum
and
maximums
because
they
were
really
punitive
in
nature,
because...
and
massachusetts
had
viewed
them
as
punitive
in
nature,
and
the
supreme
court
said,
and
i
quote,
"by
definition,
punitive
damages
are
based
upon
the
degree
of
the
defendant's
culpability.
"
that's
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
reaffirm
in
the
context
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
just
as
this
court
did
in
massachusetts
bonding.
