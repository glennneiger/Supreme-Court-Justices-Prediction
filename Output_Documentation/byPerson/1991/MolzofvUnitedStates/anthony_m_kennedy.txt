justice
kennedy
well,
is
there
a
set-off?
the
government
really
argues
this
is
a
set-off,
doesn't
it?
is
there
set-off
under
wisconsin
law?
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
wisconsin
defendant
was
a
hospital,
and
that
hospital
had
entered
into
a
contract
after
the
injury
to
give
lifetime
care.
would
that
have
been
a
set-off
under
wisconsin
law?
justice
kennedy
because
it...
because
it...
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
different
from
a
collateral
source.
justice
kennedy
mr.
wright,
in
the
new
york
regime,
where
i
take
it
there's
no
payment
for
loss
of
enjoyment
when
the
person
becomes
comatose,
is
that
person's
recovery
the
same
as
in
a
wrongful
death
action,
or
does
that
person
get
less
than
if
there
had
been
a
wrongful
death?
justice
kennedy
it
would
be
a
lost
earnings--
justice
kennedy
--in
other
words,
those
cases
approximate
the
recovery
to
what
a
wrongful
death
recovery
would
be?
