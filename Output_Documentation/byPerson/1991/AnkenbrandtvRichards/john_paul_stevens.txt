stevens
may
i
ask
you,
among
these
cases...
i'm
just
not
as
familiar
as
i
should
be
with
the
earlier
cases.
how
many
of
the
earlier
cases
was
jurisdiction
sought
to
be
invoked
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship?
are
there
some?
justice
stevens
they
were...
under
the
popovici
case
they
were
trying
to...
suing
under
bassett
or
something
or
something
like
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
