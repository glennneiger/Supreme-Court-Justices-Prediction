mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
domestic
relations
abstention
to
federal
court
jurisdiction.
this
court
since
1859
in
barber
has
stated
that
there
is
one.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
i
did.
i
did,
your
honor...
mr.
chief
justice,
excuse
me.
is
there
an
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction
for
domestic
relations?
this
court
has
said
since
1859
there
is
such
an
exception
to
jurisdiction.
i
think
from
1859
to
1930,
71
years
passed.
there
were
three
intervening
cases
which
reaffirmed
that
doctrine,
and
in
1930
justice
holmes
reaffirmed
it
yet
again,
allowing
that
doctrine
to
defeat
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
matters
involving
consoles,
and
that
was
of
course
papovici
v.
agler.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
no,
it
doesn't
your
honor,
but
of
course
this
court
has
asked
to
address
that
issue,
at
least
in
brief,
and
i
think
that
as
a
matter...
it
has
to
be
accepted
that
there
is
a
domestic
relations
exception
to
jurisdiction.
either
there
is
or
there
is
not,
and
i
suggest
that
there
is,
that
congress
has
had
130-some-odd
years,
13
separate
terms,
to
modify
it,
abolish
it,
do
something
to
it,
and
they've
never
taken
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
i
think
that
the
exception
goes
back
to
the
concept
of
the
tenth
amendment
in
that
it
actually
was
a
matter
not
delegated
to
the
federal
government.
i
think
that
the
common
understanding,
as
justice
holmes
said,
was
that
domestic
matters
are
matters
unique
to
the
states
and
belong
to
the
states.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
the
common
understanding
at
the
time
was
that
matters
domestic...
that
is,
matters
involving
parent
and
child,
husband
and
wife,
were
excluded
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
that--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--no,
not
as
it
stands,
and
this
court
has
found
that
it
did
not,
of
course,
in
thompson
v.
thompson.
i
would
make
a
caveat
to
my
no,
and
that
is,
is
a
kidnapping
act
a
domestic
matter,
is
the
question.
that
is,
how
far
does
the...
how
far
is
there
the
exception
to
jurisdiction?
what
is
excepted
from
jurisdiction...
what
domestic
matters?
what
constitutes
a
domestic
matter?
i
think
what
constitutes
a
domestic
matter--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--no,
not
in
the
context
of
the
domestic
relation
exception
to
jurisdiction.
i'm
talking
about
abstention
in
relation
to
younger,
but
not
in
relation
to
the...
if
domestic
matters
are
excepted
from
jurisdiction,
then
it's
not
an
abstention
doctrine.
then
there
either
is
jurisdiction
or
there
is
not.
either
it
is
a
matter
domestic,
or
it
is
not.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
well,
the...
the
broader
concepts
i
think
lead
to
the
same
place.
the
broader
concepts
are
the
interrelationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments,
so
that
gets
to
the
same
place,
but
this
court
has
spoken
about
domestic
relations
as
an
exception
itself
to
jurisdiction,
so
the
question
is
what
makes
it
domestic?
if
it
is
a
matter
reserved
to
the
state,
what
makes
it
domestic,
and
my
answer
is
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
states
and
have
the
states
created...
and
do
the
states
give
us
guidance,
and
they
do.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
well,
it
is
always
dangerous
to
read
things
into
the
constitution.
i
think
that
this
court
has
decided,
or
at
least
has
held,
that
it
is
jurisdictional,
and
congress
has
never
decided
to
take
that
position
on.
if
it...
if
this
court
wishes
to
rephrase
the
language
and
call
it
abstention,
that
is
something
that
it
can
do,
but
the
object
is
that
if
it
is
abstention...
whether
it's
abstention
or
jurisdiction,
although
this
court
calls
it
jurisdictional,
we
have
to
get
to
how
do
we
define
what
a
domestic
matter
is?
the
states
have
defined
what
domestic
matters
are.
the
states
have
significant
rules
that
abridge
the
rights
of
individuals
to
sue
within
the
family
unit.
fathers
cannot
sue
their
wives,
cannot
sue
mothers.
children
cannot
sue
their
parents.
it
was
incorrect
for
counsel
to
say
that
had
john
richards
run
over
his
daughter,
she
could
have
sued
him
in
state
or
federal...
in
federal
court
because
he
was
her
father,
if
it
happened
while
he
was
her
father.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
that's
correct,
your
honor,
my
point
being
that
the
states
have...
that
each
state
has
its
own
set
of
rules
involving
parent...
the
domestic
harmony,
and
the
results
that
involve
the
interrelationship
between
spouses
and
between
parents
and
children.
the
federal
courts
and
the
federal
government
has
always
deferred
to
that
for
the
simple
reason
that
domestic
matters
are
unique
to
the
states.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
well,
by
this
court's
phrasing
of
the...
by
this
court's
prior
determinations
that
domestic
matters
are
jurisdictional,
the
question
that
leads
to
is,
is
it
a
domestic
matter,
and
how
do
we
decide
if
something
involves
the
domestic
relations.
that's
how
it
seems
to
come
to
me,
and
when
you're
deciding
is
something
a
domestic
matter
or
not,
you
have
to
see
it's
going
to
be
the
same
considerations
as
in
an
argument
that
involves
comity,
that
involves
younger
v.--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--i'm
saying
that's
a
factor.
i'm
saying...
yes
to
the
extent
that
you
look
to,
not
just
louisiana,
all
states
have
very
particular
rules
as
between
suits
between
spouses
and
suits
between
children.
in
fact,
the
common
law
i
think
until
this
century
did
not
permit...
well,
i
know
until
this
century,
did
not
permit
suits
as
between
spouses,
nor
did
they
permit
suits
as
between
parent
and
child.
they
simply
didn't
permit
it.
so
they
have
taken
control...
they
have
wrested
control
of
this
area,
of
the
area
involving
parent
and
children,
husband
and
wife,
without
any
question
by
anybody,
and
the
reason
is
because
it
is
a
matter
uniquely
unto
the
state,
so
you
look
narrowly
at
an
individual
law,
but
the
scope,
these...
the
areas
involving
suits
between
children,
or
suits
between
spouses,
or
a
child
and
their
father,
are
a
matter
of
the
domestic
relations.
the
considerations
have
always
been
domestic...
the
harmony
of
the
family
and
the
peace
of
the
family.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
no.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
making
that
argument,
and
i'm
not
making
the
argument
that
any
tort
involves...
is
domestic.
i
think
that's
a
matter
for
the
sound
discretion
of
the
court.
that's
a
matter
that
the
district
judge
has
to
look
at
and
say,
is
this
a
domestic
matter?
when
you
get
to
the
heart
of
it,
are
we
talking
about
a
matter
that
will
be
domestic,
and
if
so,
then
we
don't
handle
it
because
the
federal
courts
never
have
handled
domestic
matters,
and
i
don't
think
that
judge
arceneaux's
discretion
should
be
overturned,
that
he
made
an
abuse
of
that
discretion.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
i
have
not
addressed
the
interplay
between
the--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--would
you
repeat
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
no.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
because
congress
has
made
that
a
crime.
congress
has
specifically
stated
that
it's
a
crime,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
common
understanding
that
federal
crimes...
that
crimes
that
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
constitution,
if
it
was
a
federal
crime
it
would
have
been
in
federal
court,
domestic
or
otherwise.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
but
there's...
the
answer
is
there
has
never...
at
least
my
answer
is
there
has
never
been
any
case
that
has
excluded
that
as
a
matter
of
being
a
domestic
case,
whereas
there
have
been
in
the
civil
arena.
had
there
been
such
a
case,
it
is
my
guess
that
congress
would
have
looked
at
it
and
said
you
have
extended
the
domestic
relations
doctrine
a
bit
far.
it
is
a...
if
it's
a
federal
offense,
then
the
federal
criminal
courts
should
handle
that
matter.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
no...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
and
in
re
burrus
it
was
a
habeas
case--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--in
simms
and
de
la
rama,
they
were
both
cases
that
emanated
from
the
territories.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
in
federal
court?
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
is
it
during...
the
tort
occurred
during
the
existence
of
the
marriage?
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
then
it's
going
to
be
a
matter--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--that
would
be
a
matter
that
would
go
to
the...
that
would
fall
within
the
domestic
relations
exception
and
it
should
go
to
state
court
as
a
part
of
the
state
court's
unitary
system
that
involves
their
special
interest
in
the
family,
because
when
you're
dealing
with
the
family,
that
is
a
matter
that
is
uniquely
the
state's
concern...
the
health
and
well-being
of
the
domestic
harmony
of
the
families
within
it.
i
don't
think...
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
state's
interest
in
the
family
as
a
unit
is
strong
and
is
unique
and
is
very
basic
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
in
support
of
that
interest,
what
the
states
have
done
is
they
have...
or
various
states
have
done
it
in
various
ways
but
they
have
tried
to
come
up
with
a
unitary
way
or
means
of
dealing
with
matters
that
evolve
from
domestic
disputes.
so
that
there
is
the
juvenile
court
system,
there
is
the
divorce
and
custody...
as
in
fact
in
this
case.
this
matter
ended
up
in
criminal
courts,
in
two
separate
criminal
courts,
in
a
juvenile
court,
in
a
custody
court,
and
three
separate
court
of
appeals.
there's...
the
state
has
recent...
the
state
of
louisiana
at
least
has
recently
brought
together
all
their
juvenile
court
laws
into
a
700-page
tome
and
each
state,
each
state
in
this
country
is
trying
to
do
the
same
thing.
they're
trying
to
bring
together
the
laws
and
treat
it
in
a
unitary
way.
the
factors
that
are
always
in
support
of
comity,
of
the
doctrine
of
younger
v.
harris,
is
that
you
don't
want
to
disrupt
this
unified
body.
you
don't
want
to
risk
the
federal
courts
giving
de
novo
trials
after
state
matters.
the
normal
circumstance
in
which
this
case
is
going
to
come
to
a
federal
court
is
not
from
the
winning
party
but
from
the
losing
party.
the
losing
party
in
the
state
action
is
going
to
try
and
relitigate
the
matter
through
the
federal
courts.
that's
the
normal
way
in
which
this
case...
this
is
the
usual
way
in
which
this
case
is
going
to
come
to
the
federal
courts.
that's
the
way
it's
going
to
come
in
all...
in
most
other
cases,
to
use
the
united
states
district
court
as
a
court
of
review
for
fact-finding
unfavorable
to
the
person
while
they
were
in
the
state.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
that
was
diversity,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
apologize.
that
was
the
enforcement
of
an
alimony
decree,
and
that
was
in--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--yes,
they
did,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the...
so
that
yes,
i
agree
that
there
is
a
limit
to
it.
it
does
not
go
forever.
you
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere,
and
how
do
you
draw
the
line,
and
who
draws
that
line,
and
i
suggest...
the
way
i
would
suggest
that
the
line
be
drawn
is
whether
the
matter
sued
upon
occurred
during
the
existence
of
the...
during
the
marriage,
because
if
it
occurred
during
the
existence
of
the
marriage,
those
are
the
matters
in
which
the
state
has
taken
a
particular
interest.
if
it's
something
that
occurs
after
the
marriage,
then
there's
not
going
to
be
any
revisitation
of
any
of
the
facts
around
the
divorce
or
around
the
custody
decrees
or
around
the
alimony
decrees.
if
it
occurs...
that's
if
it
occurs
after
the
marriage
has
terminated,
but
if
it
occurs
before
the
marriage
has
legally
terminated,
as
happened
in
this
case,
then
all
of
those
factors,
all
of
those
actions
are
going
to
be...
are
involved
in
the
divorce
case
itself.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
justice
o'connor,
these
cases
never
end.
the
custody
of
the
children
is
always,
in
all
instances,
subject
to
review,
so
much
so
that
for
a
long
time
custody
judgments
were
not
even
considered
final
judgments
for
the
purpose
of
full
faith
and
credit,
so
the
case
never
ends.
if
in
this
case
we
come
and
there
is
a
jury
interrogatory
which
determines
that
no
abuse
occurred...
and
no
abuse
did
occur.
these
are
allegations.
there
has
never
been
a
full
and...
a
true
and
full
hearing
in
this
matter.
i
mean,
the
only
hearings
have
been
where
mr.
richards
was
unable
to
present
a
defense
because
he
was
about...
because
he
had
criminal
charges
hanging
over
his
head
and
elected
on
advice
of
counsel
not
to
expose
his
defenses.
but
when
there
is
a
full-blown
hearing,
a
full
trial,
and
then
the
facts
are
revisited,
or
actually
in
this
instance
visited
at
the
first
instance
and
the
factors
that
come
out
show
that
no
abuse
occurred,
or
that
the
abuse
occurred
at
the
instance
of
the
mother,
or
that...
or
for
whatever
other
contradictory
verdict
comes
down,
someone...
it
may
not
be
jon
richards
because
his
parental
rights
have
been
terminated,
but
someone
is
going
to
go
back
to
the
state
court,
or
someone
ought
to
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
say
is
the
best
interest
of
this
child
such
that
we
should
not
now
revisit
this
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
which
has
finally
come
to
bear?
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
well,
it
is
always
a
matter
that's
open.
the
state
represents
the
children,
and
often
cases
it's
the
state
taking
away
children
as
against
both
parents,
so
the
state
would
have
the
responsibility,
i
would
suggest,
to
reopen
that
matter.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
that's...
that
would
be
correct,
and
what...
but
what
would
happen
is
you
now
have
the
federal
courts
telling
the
state
courts
that
we
don't...
that
really
you
haven't
done
it
correctly.
you've
come
to
the
wrong
result.
you
need
to
relitigate
this
matter.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
that
there'd
be
no
collateral
estoppal
as
between
the
state
proceeding
and
the
federal
proceeding?
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
that...
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
and
what
would
happen
is
that...
and
then
you
see
what
happens.
a
party
loses
in
the
state
and
says
well,
wait
a
minute,
since
i
can
reopen
this
matter,
i'm
going
to
hop
over
into
the
united
states
district
court
to
relitigate
my
case
because
i
have
a
friendlier...
i
perceive
myself
to
having
a
friendlier
forum
there.
i
have
more
favorable
laws,
as
is
suggested,
and
so
i
get
to
redo
the
whole
case,
which
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
in
the
state
court.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
no.
my
test
is
whether
or
not
it
occurred
during
the
existence
of
the
marriage
and
it
involves
the
state
interests
vis-a-vis
parent--
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
--well,
the
state
has
no
interest
or
no
involvement
in
the
other,
per
se.
i
know
that
this
court
has
never
extended
younger
to
a
diversity
case
and...
but
i
suggest
that
the
state
interests
are
the
same
as
in
a
diversity
case,
and
the
federal
interests
if
anything
have
decreased.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
there
does,
and
i
think
that
the
pending
proceeding
is
the...
and
this
is
a
stretch
which
i
admit,
but
the
pending
nature
of
the
proceeding
is
that
custody
is
always
pending,
is
always
on-going,
because
the
state's
interest
never
ends.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
absolutely
with
that.
i
mean,
the
same
purpose
can
be
achieved
in
either
way,
and
i
think
the
purpose
ought
to
be
achieved,
and
the
purpose
that
ought
to
be
achieved
is
that
the
state...
that
the
federal
court
in
this
instance
is
not
to
be
used
by
disgruntled
litigants.
in
this
case
they're
not
a
disgruntled
litigant,
but
that's
what's
normally
going
to
happen,
to
be
used
to
review
or
revisit
or
to
gain
some
advantage.
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
purpose
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
paul
s.
weidenfeld
it
would
not...
well,
in
two
ways.
one,
she
is
in
effect
the
co-respondent,
and
there
is
the
eternal
triangle.
it's
a
domestic
matter.
it's
a
three-edged
sort
of
triangle...
mother,
the
new
girlfriend,
and
the
father...
so
in
that
sense...
and
in
louisiana
you
couldn't
marry
a
proven
co-respondent,
but
i
think
the
easier
way
that
it
works
is
that
once
it's...
once
it
is
jon
richards,
if
that...
if
there's
no
jurisdiction
in
that
case,
then
the
girlfriend,
as
opposed
to
having
them
in
two
instances,
you
come
very
close
to
a
colorado
river
type
situation
where
you've
got
litigations
in
parallel
jurisdictions
and
it
would...
the
duplication
of
resources,
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
have
the
two,
so
the
one
would...
the
one
against
the
girlfriend
would
come
back
over
to
the
state.
i
would
only
close
by
saying
that
there
needs
to
be
some
way
to
determine
what
is
a
matter
that
is
domestic,
and
i
think
that
that
ought
to
be
a
matter
that
goes
to
the
discretion
of
the
court,
of
the
trial
court.
they're
in
the
best
position
to
make
that
determination,
and
that
judge
arceneaux
in
this
instance
did
not
abuse
his
discretion.
thank
you.
