mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
ducote,
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
two
young
girls,
one
9
and
one
7,
who
come
before
you
through
their
mother
as
their
next
friend.
their
parents
were
divorced
and
their
mother
was
awarded
full
custody,
and
during
the
court-ordered
visitation
they
were
physically
and
sexually
molested
by
their
father
and
his
girlfriend.
because
of
the
abuse,
the
jefferson
parish,
louisiana
juvenile
court
through
its
child
protection
statutes
permanently
terminated
all
the
parental
rights
of
the
father
and
permanently
enjoined
him
from
having
any
contact
whatsoever
with
the
children
again.
therefore,
under
state
law
he
is
a
legal
stranger
to
them.
that
decision
was
never
appealed
and
is
final.
after
that
decision,
the
children
filed
suit
against
their
father
and
his
girlfriend
in
tort,
in
federal
court
in
louisiana,
under
diversity
of
citizenship,
because
they
were
no
longer
residing
in
the
same
state.
the
district
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
through
the
case
out
saying
what
this
really
is
is
a
domestic
relations
case
over
which
the
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction.
i
think
it's
first
important
to
note
what
this
case
is
not.
this
case
is
not
about
establishing
a
new
federal
cause
of
action.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
concerns
expressed
by
the
chief
justice
and
other
members
of
this
court
about
creating
new
federal
causes
of
action
such
as
the
actions
now
pending
before
congress
concerning
making
all
crimes
against
women
perhaps
civil
rights
actions
which
could
be
brought
in
federal
courts,
or
against
making
all
crimes
committed
with
handguns
federal
offenses.
there's
no
question,
and
it's
never
been
contested
in
this
case,
that
all
of
the
elements
of
diversity
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
that's
correct.
it's
a
simple
diversity
tort
action.
every
tort
action
under
diversity
is
a
state
and
a
local
cause
of
action,
just
as
this
case
is.
if
these
children
had
been,
say,
run
over
by
their
father
by
an
automobile
they
would
have
federal
relief.
if
they
had
been
sexually
molested,
say,
by
their
minister
or
by
their
schoolteacher,
they
would
have
a
federal
forum.
perhaps...
and
it's
not
clear
under
the
fifth
circuit's
test
where
the
line
would
be
drawn,
but
perhaps
if
it
had
been
an
uncle...
an
uncle
or
an
aunt
or
a
first
cousin
who
had
molested
them,
they'd
also
be
able
to
sue
in
federal
court
under
diversity
of
jurisdiction.
why
is
it,
then,
that
the
federal
courts
can
abstain
or
simply
refuse
to
hear
a
case
because
it's
the
father
who's
involved,
and
i
submit
that
they
can't.
i
don't
believe
that
the
test
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
whether
or
not
we
want
to
get
involved,
when
the
federal
courts
say
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
because
it
sounds
too
much
like
a
family
matter.
the
real
question
here--
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
--well,
one
of
the
questions
the
court
asked
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
federal...
a
domestic
relations
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
my
position
is
that
if
the
diversity
criteria
are
met
and
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
the
$50,000
threshold,
no
matter
what
the
source
of
the
money
is,
it
should
be
within
federal
jurisdiction
unless
congress
determines
otherwise.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
well,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
divorce
itself
has
no
$50,000
threshold,
nor
does
child
custody,
nor
does
child
visitation.
if
what
is
sued
for
is
money,
then
yes,
if
the
$50,000
threshold
is
met
and
the
diversity
criteria
are
met,
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
until
congress
says
otherwise.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
unfortunately,
at
this
point,
given
the
fact
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
defined
by
congress
and
congress
is
not
exempted,
that
sort
of
question
from
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction,
i
think
to
be
true
to
the
constitution,
yes,
the
federal
courts
would
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
my
position
is
that
if
the
diversity
criteria
are
met
and
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
$50,000
and
the
state
law
that's
applicable
in
the
jurisdiction
where
the
federal
court
sits
allows
for
that
cause
of
action,
the
federal
courts
under
article
3
and
the
congressional
mandate
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1332
says
that
you
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
i
think
first
you
have
to
look
at
the
state
law,
and
whatever
the
state
where
the
forum
sits
says
about
what
can
be
done
with
property
that
another
state
would
control.
unfortunately,
and
as
all
of
the
law
review
articles
and
judge
weinstein
in
the
spindel
case
point
out,
most
of
what
the
courts
have
said
about
the
domestic
relations
exception
have
been
on
very
weak
grounding,
that
these
things
about
well,
ecclesiastical
courts
used
to
do
this,
and
courts
of
equity
didn't
do
this
and
all,
just
don't
apply,
and
i
think
with
the
position,
unfortunately,
where
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
constitution
says
about
who
decides
what
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
and
return
the
responsibility
to
congress
to
sort
through
the
problems
that
you're
suggesting,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
principle
if
the
federal
courts
can
simply
define
their
own
jurisdictional
boundaries
we
just
have
all
sorts
of--
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
--i
agree.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
no,
but
in
the
diversity
cases...
and
that's
the
unique
nature
of
diversity
jurisdiction...
diversity
jurisdiction
specifically
deals
with
local
causes
of
action,
local
concerns,
and
simply
says
that
because
of
this...
in
the
bullone
case
it's
expressed,
the
concern
about
local
prejudice,
and
then
the...
sort
of
the
equal
footing
that
nonstate
parties
should
have
in
that
court,
that
the
federal
courts
should
have
diversity
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
well,
the
court...
the
last
pronouncement
was
in
the
1930's
on
the
domestic
relations
exception,
except
for
thompson
v.
thompson
in
1988,
when
in
a
footnote
the
court
talked
about
the
tradition
of
the
domestic
relations
exception,
and
what
i'm
saying...
and
again,
i
don't
think
this
is
essential
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
cause
of
action,
but
i
think
what
we
have
to
do
is
sort
of
pull
that
all
back
together
and
make
some
sense
out
of
it
and
get
back
to
the
issue
that
congress
needs
to
set
out
what
the
parameters
of
federal
jurisdiction
are
and
what
are
the
exceptions.
and
i
think
congress
did
an
excellent
job
of
that
in
1990
in
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
provision
under
28
u.s.c.
1367,
where
the
court
said...
congress
said
the
federal
courts
can
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
if
this
criteria
is
met,
this
criteria,
and
they
may
choose
to
decline
supplemental
jurisdiction
if
state
law
is
uncertain
or
the
issues
are
too
complicated
or
for
other
good
reasons.
so
in
that
case,
congress
specifically
authorized
an
abstention,
if
you
would,
from
jurisdiction,
and
i
think
that's
really
what
we
need
to
do
so
this
doesn't
spread
further
and--
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
--i
think
it
had
to
do
with
perhaps
some
of
the
other
abstention
doctrines,
younger
v.
colorado
water
district,
but
i
think
if
we're
going
to
have
exceptions
to
federal
jurisdiction,
or
we're
going
to
allow
for
abstention
of
federal
jurisdiction,
then
i
think
it
should
be
by
congressional
mandate
and
not
by
judicial
activism.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
the
specific
issue
in
this
case
has
never
been
addressed
by
the
court.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
well,
i
think
the
cases
of
burrus
and
barber
and
popovici
and
de
la
rama
v.
de
la
rama
have
simply
said
in
very
broad
brush
strokes
the
relations
between
husband
and
wife,
parent
and
child,
belong
to
the
states
and
we're
not
going
to
get
involved
in
it,
and
those
cases
have
sort
of
set
up
judicial
chaos
for
100
years
in
all
of
the
circuits
that
have
led
to
this
sort
of
decision.
the
fact
that
in
1991
a
federal
district
court
can
look
at
sexual
abuse,
a
sexual
abuse
tort
action
and
say
that
well,
this
is
domestic
relations
under...
citing
barber
v.
barber
in
19...
i'm
sorry,
1880,
shows
the
extent
to
which
this
issue
is
still
uncertain.
so
i
think
yes,
it...
again,
the
principle
is
important
that
either
congress
sets
up
the
parameters
of
federal
jurisdiction
or
the
courts
do
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
and
that's
the
concern,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
most
important
issue
here,
because
these
kids
should
be
able
to
sue
in
tort
no
matter
who
the
defendant
is
if
there's
a
cognizable
state
cause
of
action
and
the
other
criteria
of
the
diversity
statute
have
been
met.
the
other
issue
is
the
younger
abstention
issue.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
under
louisiana
law
it
would
not.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
louisiana
probably
has
the
most
restrictive
issue
preclusion
statutes
in
the
country.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
i
don't
think
so.
you
know,
very
often
in
other
contexts,
for
example
in
police
brutality
cases,
it's
not
unusual
for
there
to
be
state
court
proceedings
and
federal
court
proceedings
in
the
prosecution
as
well
as
administratively
in
any
number
of
areas,
so
i
think
the
law
should
not...
or
the
rules
of
the
game
should
not
change
simply
because
we're
dealing
with
children
or
because
we're
dealing
with
sexual
abuse
and
we're
dealing
with
families.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that's
happened
in
the
courts
is
this
issue
is
something
that
people
haven't
wanted
to
get
involved
in,
and
they've
looked
for
a
way
to
sort
of
get
rid
of
it,
and
i
think
in
another
context,
were
it
not
a
family
context,
those
questions
wouldn't
even
be
raised.
and
that's
sort
of
what
the
district
court
does
with
the
younger
issue
and
says
well,
you
know,
the
state
court
permanently
terminated
this
man's
rights,
therefore
the
state's
interest
in
this
case
is
obviously
even
more
compelling
than
it
would
be
in
another
case,
and
that's
even
more
cause
for
us
to
keep
out
of
it.
and
i
look
at
it
and
i
say
because
his
rights
were
terminated,
if
you
apply
the
younger
rules
the
state's
already
finished
with
the
case.
the
man
is
a
legal
stranger,
so
it's
even
more
compelling
it
should
be
in
federal
court.
so
again
i
think
the
rules
have
to
be
clarified...
family,
no
family,
whatever.
if
it
meets
the
criteria
of
the
statute,
unless
congress
exempts
it
it
should
be
adjudicated.
as
has
this
court
said
in
deakins
v.
monaghan,
the
federal
courts
have
an
unflagging
duty
to
adjudicate
cases
that
are
properly
in
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
absolutely
none.
it
was
straightforward
tort
action
for
compensation.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
i
have
no
problem
with
that,
and
as
justice
kennedy
discussed
in
the
case
of
mcintyre
v.
mcintyre
in
the
ninth
circuit,
when
issues
of
status
are
not
involved
and
the
court...
the
federal
court
has
not
asked
to
impinge
on
the
state
supervision
of
a
minor
and
it's
just
simply
an
issue
of
compensatory
damages,
it's
like
every
other
case,
and
again
we
just
can't
simply
say
well,
this
is
family
business
and
we
don't
like
to
be
involved
in
family
business
that--
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
--well,
i
think
there
are
two
points.
one
is
that
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
because
of
not
only
the
rules
themselves
but
because
of
federal
court
decisions
in
child
sexual
abuse
cases,
provide
a
better
opportunity
for
the
evidence
that
is
available
in
this
case
to
be
presented
to
a
jury.
the
second
question
is
the
fact
that
one
of
the
respondents
is
an
attorney
in
this
case
who
practices
in
the
local
state
court
where
the
case
would
have
to
be
brought.
these
are
the
traditional
sort
of
concerns
that
are
the
underpinnings
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
these
out-of-state
plaintiffs
having
to
go
into
a
state
court
where
one
of
the
respondents
is
a
practicing
attorney
might
not
receive
as
fair
a
shake
as
they
would
in
the
federal
court.
and
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
a
state
court
action
can
result
in
a
federal...
or
the
facts
that
result
in
a
state
court
action
can
result
in
a
federal
action,
and
we
don't
have
all
of
this
fear.
for
example,
you
can
have
a
criminal
conviction
in
state
court
and
then
a
tort
action
among
the
same
players,
the
perpetrator
and
the
victim,
and
if
there's
a
decision
in
the
federal
court
action
based
on
diversity
that
is
contrary
to
the
state
court
criminal
proceeding
it's
no
basis
to
go
back
and
reopen
the
criminal
court
proceeding.
just
as
in
this
case,
this
man's
parental
rights
were
terminately
and
unalterably
and
permanently
terminated
in
an
unappealed
final
decision.
that's
it.
the
case
is
over.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
he
would
have
no
right
of
action
under
state
law
because
he's
a
legal
stranger
to
the
children.
the
case
is
over
and
done
with.
now,
people
can
go
into
domestic
court
on
all
sorts
of
reasons
and
try
to
reopen
cases.
the
fact
that
people
can
attempt
to
do
things
doesn't
mean
that
the
whole
constitutional
and
congressional
grant
of
jurisdiction
should
then
tremble
and
say
well,
you
know,
this
might
happen,
this
might
happen
and
this
might
happen.
he's
over
and
done
with
as
far
as
the
children
are
concerned
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
well,
commencing
about
the
1970's
virtually
every
state
has
enacted
termination
of
parental
rights
statutes
because
of
the
child
abuse
problem.
the
denial
of
custody
is
different
than
what
happened
here.
this
is
a
permanent
termination
of
all
parental
rights,
meaning
he
doesn't
even
have
the
right
as
another
parent
would
to
come
in
and
seek
custody.
he's
not
on
the
same
footing
any
more,
and
he's
permanently
enjoined
from
any
contact.
mr.
richard
lynn
ducote
certainly.
i
don't
think
that
has
any
bearing.
i
think
that
made
this
a
clearer
case
for
review
because
his
parental
rights
were
terminated,
but
i
don't
think
that
in
and
of
itself
has
any
bearing
because,
as
justice
blackmun
questioned,
is
this
an
exception,
or
is
it
abstention,
and
if
it's
going
to
be
abstention,
then
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
abstentions
that
the
court
has
recognized...
younger,
but
again
doesn't
apply
because
there
are
no
pending
state
actions.
so
again
if
it
meets
the
diversity
criteria
and
it's
a
diversity
case,
then
the
federal
court
has
to
do
what
congress
says
it's
supposed
to
do...
hear
the
case,
decide
on
the
merits,
award
damages,
don't
award
damages,
whatever
the
jury
decides,
and
what
happens
in
the
state
court
proceedings
will
happen,
and
that's
to
be
dealt
with
separately.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
