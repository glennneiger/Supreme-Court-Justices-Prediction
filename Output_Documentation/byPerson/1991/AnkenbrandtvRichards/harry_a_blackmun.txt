justice
blackmun
counsel,
i'm
interested
from
a
practical
point
of
view.
what
is
the
great
attraction
for
you
of
a
federal
court
in
louisiana?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
that
general
proposition
doesn't
give
us
the
answer
to
this
case,
yet.
justice
blackmun
--you're
pressing
for
an
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction.
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
we're
really
talking
about
abstention
rather
than
exception?
justice
blackmun
well,
they
certainly
are
different,
but
i'm
wondering
if
all
through
the
years
we're
really
speaking
of
the
federal
courts
abstaining
from
getting
into
this
area
rather
than
formulating
a
nonstatutory
exception,
so
to
speak,
to
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
blackmun
well,
isn't
it
dangerous
to
read
into
the
constitution
what
isn't
there,
to
wit,
a
domestic
relations
exception
to
federal
jurisdiction,
and
aren't
we
on
sounder
ground
if
we
were
talking
about
abstention,
as
maybe
the
court
should
have
done
over
the
years?
