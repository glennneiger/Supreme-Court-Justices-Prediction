chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-367,
carol
ankenbrandt
v.
jon
a.
richards.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ducote...
mr.
ducote.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
could
go
further,
could
we
not,
mr.
ducote,
in
saying
what
the
case
is
not
about,
in
saying
that
it
is
not
about
a
decree
of
divorce,
it
is
not
about
child
custody,
it's
not
about
probate...
something
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
husband
sues
for
a
divorce
and
requests
a
property
settlement
agreement,
saying
that
the
amount
of
controversy,
our
property,
amounts
to
several
hundred
thousand
dollars.
would
that
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
for
diversity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
really
don't
have
to
decide
that
question,
do
we,
to
rule
in
your
favor?
there
could
be
a
domestic
relations
exception
which
embraced
divorce,
child
custody,
and
still
did
not
extend
as
far
as
your
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
some
of
our
cases,
mr.
ducote,
we've
said
that
when
congress
enacts
a
jurisdictional
measure
it
takes
it
with
knowledge
of
any
judicial
gloss
on
it,
so
to
speak,
such
as
canon
v.
university
of
chicago.
now,
this
court
has
been
speaking
about
domestic
relations
exceptions
to
diversity
jurisdiction
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
and
the
congress
has
revisited
the
diversity
statute
several
times
and
never
made
any
addition
to
it
indicating
that
it
disapproved
of
that
exception.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
your
analysis
is
a
little
bit
two-dimensional
when
you
simply
say
well,
we
just
look
at
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
suggestion
that
that
was
done
in
the
light
of
this
court's
statement
about
the
domestic
relations
exception?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
these
cases,
speaking
of
the
domestic
relations
exception,
have
been
on
the
books...
our
books
for
a
long
time.
are
you
saying
we
should
overrule
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
absolutely
right,
and
one
could
easily
say
that
those
cases
referred
to
things
like
seeking
a
decree
of
divorce,
child
custody,
other
nontransitory
causes
of
action,
and
that
therefore
your
case
is
not
governed
by
them,
but
when
you
get
into
the
more
general
area,
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
for
just
a
rather
sweeping
clearing
of
the
brush,
so
to
speak,
which
i'm
not
sure
isn't
inconsistent
with
all
our
cases.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ducote.
mr.
weidenfeld,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
weidenfeld,
you
just
use
the
word
abstention.
did
you
mean
exception?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
really
is
a
question
of
what
law
is
applicable,
isn't
it,
rather
than
whether
there's
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
if
that
is
the
rule
in
louisiana,
presumably
the
same
result
will
obtain
on
the
merits
no
matter
whether
it's
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
weidenfeld,
a
few
minutes
ago
you
were
asked
by
justice
stevens
whether
there
had
been
any
cases
sounding
of
diversity
jurisdiction
in
which
this
statement
as
to
the
domestic
relations
exception
had
been
announced.
what
do
you
conceive
the
basis
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
to
have
been
in
the
case
of
barber
v.
barber?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
and
that
certainly
suggests
that
even
back
then,
december
term
1858,
that
the
court
saw
definite
limits
to
the
domestic
relations
exception,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
didn't
they
allow
there
the
enforcement
of
a
new
york
judgment
for
alimony?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
for
younger,
even
in
the
criminal
context
there
has
to
be
a
pending
proceeding,
doesn't
there,
a
pending
proceeding
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
need
a
domestic
relations
exception
then,
if
we
have
that
sort
of
an
abstention
doctrine.
it's
to
accomplish
exactly
the
same
purpose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weidenfeld.
mr.
ducote,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
most...
all
of
us
i
guess
react
by
where
our
own
practice
was.
where
i
practiced,
you
could...
you
would...
a
father
who
was
denied
custody
could
have
some
years
later
come
back
in
and
moved
to
reopen
that
saying
look,
the
mother
is
not
proving
to
be
a
good
custodian,
there
are
new
facts
available,
the
money
is
situated
differently,
the
child
is
now
14
years
old
and
expressed
a
desire
to
live
with
me,
and
the
decree
would
be
reopened.
that
doesn't
happen
in
louisiana.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ducote.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
