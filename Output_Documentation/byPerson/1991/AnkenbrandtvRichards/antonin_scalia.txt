justice
scalia
well,
but
you...
in
your
earlier
answers
to
the
chief
justice
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
well,
if
it
were
a
family
matter,
that
would
be
a
different
question.
as
i
understand,
your
position
is
if
it
were
probate,
if
it
were
any
traditional
family
matter,
there
would
still
be
no
basis
for
the
federal
court
staying
out,
right?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
so
you
can
sue
in
federal
court
for
divorce.
justice
scalia
what
about
a
suit
for
the
partition
of
real
estate
in
another
state?
i
mean,
that,
like
divorce,
has
been
considered
traditionally
a
nontransitory
cause
of
action,
so
you
had
to
sue
within
the
state
where
the
property
was.
if
you
sued
in
another
state's
courts
you
couldn't
get
it,
but
your
position
is
you
can
sue
in
any
federal
court
for
it.
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
that
that
congressional
mandate
took
into
account
accepted
notions
of
transitory
causes
of
action
and
nontransitory
causes
of
action
so
that
it
was
entirely
understood
that
to
get
a
divorce
you
could
only
sue
in
the
court
of
the
state
where
the
people
are
resident?
justice
scalia
they're
not
defining
their
own.
they're
just
assuming
that
the
congressional
grant
of
jurisdiction,
if
not
the
constitutional
grant
of
jurisdiction,
took
into
account
ordinary
notions
of
nontransitory
causes
of
action
that
could
only
be
brought
in
certain
courts.
what
about
criminal
jurisdiction?
can
federal
courts
try
for
state
crimes?
the
traditional
notion
is
that
no
sovereign
enforces
the
criminal
laws
of
another
sovereign.
justice
scalia
can
a
state
attorney
bring
in
federal
court
a
prosecution
for
a
state
crime?
justice
scalia
mr.
ducote,
was
there
any
equitable
relief
sought
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
there
were
equitable
relief.
i
mean,
would
you
have
any
problem
with
the
federal
court
using
its
power
to
decline
to
exercise
equitable
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
that
family
law
matters,
even
more
broadly
than
divorce
and
status
and
affiliation
and
so
forth,
shouldn't
be
addressed
by
federal
courts?
justice
scalia
if
a
wife
kills
her
husband
somehow
in
violation
of
federal
law
is
it
your
position
that
a
federal
criminal
court
could
not
entertain
the
suit
because
that
involves
domestic
matters?
justice
scalia
i
know
you
haven't.
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
justice
scalia
if
a
wife
kills
her
husband
in
some
manner
that
violates
federal
law,
using
a
handgun
that's
been
carried
interstate
or
something
like
that,
is
it
your
position
that
there
can
be
no
federal
prosecution
because
it's
a
domestic
matter?
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
that
different
from
a
tort
in
which
a
wife
hits
her
husband,
and
then
the
next
question
is
going
to
be
why
is
that
different
from
a
tort
in
which
a
father
hits
his
son?
justice
scalia
this
is
not
a
spouse-killing
federal
crime,
it's
a
general
federal
criminal
statute.
you
cannot...
you
know,
any
crime
committed
with
the
use
of
a
handgun
that's
been
carried
interstate,
and
it
so
happens
that
a
wife
kills
her
husband
in
violation
of
that
statute.
it's
not
a
specific
federal
spousal
statute.
justice
scalia
but
mr.
weidenfeld,
there
are
a
lot
of
tort
actions
that
could
have
an
effect
on
a
custody
decree.
i
mean,
a
tort
action
by
a
total
stranger
against
the
mother
who
has
been
given
custody
on
the
ground
that
she
was
a
drunken
driver
and
injured...
or
on
the
ground
that
she
was
violent
and
whipped
the
plaintiff's
child,
i
mean,
that
would
be
an
indication
in
the
state
courts,
wouldn't
it,
of
the
mother's
incapacity
or
unsuitability
to
have
custody
of
the
child?
now,
is
that
tort
suit
to
be
disallowed
in
federal
courts
as
well
because
it
might
have
a
collateral
estoppal
effect
on
the
state
custody
proceeding?
justice
scalia
well,
i
know
that's
your
test
because
it
fits
your
case,
but
i
don't
know
why
the
one
is
any
more
logical
than
the
other.
