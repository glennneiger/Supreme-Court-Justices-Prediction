justice
o'connor
mr.
weidenfeld,
do
you
think
the
exception
which
you
would
have
us
continue
to
recognize
is
based
on
the
constitution,
or
is
it
something
statutory?
can
congress
change
it?
justice
o'connor
so
you
don't
think
congress
could
directly
address
this,
and
for
instance
in
the
parental
kidnapping
case
direct
federal
courts
to
have
jurisdiction
of
certain
family
related
matters?
justice
o'connor
yes.
would
you
answer,
though,
the
question
i
asked?
do
you
think
congress
can
enact
laws
such
as
the
parental
kidnapping
case
and
give
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
matters
that
do
relate,
in
a
sense,
to
family
matters?
justice
o'connor
yes
or
no.
justice
o'connor
but
mr.
weidenfeld,
the
state
court
is
through
with
this
case.
it's
awarded
custody
to
the
mother,
the
marriage
is
terminated,
only
money
damages
are
sought.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
case
for
federal
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
o'connor
in
louisiana,
is
it
open
to
a
third
party
stranger
to
come
in
and
reopen
a
question
like
that?
justice
o'connor
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if
instead
custody
had
been
awarded
to
the
mother
but
no
termination
of
parental
rights?
would
you
still
think
that
the
federal
courts
should
entertain
the
tort
action?
