justice
souter
well,
we
may
have
deferred
to
it,
but
it
doesn't
make
it
jurisdictional,
does
it?
justice
souter
so
you
think
it's...
your
criterion
of
what
is
domestic
looks
to
the
state
law
of
capacity,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
so
in
any
case
these
are
sort
of
pointers
as
to
what
presumably
the
court
may
have
had
in
mind
and
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
perhaps
in
ratifying
what
we
did,
but
you're
not
making
the
argument
that
every
state
law
with
respect
to
capacity
is
jurisdictional--
justice
souter
--with
respect
to
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
souter
well,
couldn't...
are
you
agreeing
that
you
could
not
claim
collateral
estoppal,
an
offensive
use,
let's
say,
of
collateral
estoppal
in
a
state
court
if
the
state
proceeding
is
left
open
and
there
has
been
a
determination
and
judgment
in
the
federal
proceeding?
justice
souter
no,
the
other
way
around.
let's...
i
thought
you
were
saying
the
state
proceeding
is
never
closed,
so
there's
no
judgment
and
therefore
no
preclusive
effect
running
from
the
state
proceeding
binding
on
the
parties
in
the
federal
proceeding,
but
if
the
federal
proceeding
goes
to
judgment
and
the
state
proceeding
is
always
open,
one
could
make,
i
presume,
either
offensive
or
defensive
use
of
collateral
estoppal
if
one
reopens
the
state
proceedings
based
on
findings
of
fact
made
in
the
federal
tort
action.
justice
souter
okay.
