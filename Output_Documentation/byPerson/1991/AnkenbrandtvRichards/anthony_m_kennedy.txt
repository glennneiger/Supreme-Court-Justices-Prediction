justice
kennedy
counsel,
before
you
get
to
that
point,
suppose
that
in
this
case
the
mother
was
involved
in
the
proceedings
in
the
louisiana
domestic
court
and
the
court
made
findings
of
fact
that
the
abuse
had
not
occurred?
i
take
it
that
that
would
have
operated
as
issue
preclusion
in
the
suit
that
you're
bringing
now.
justice
kennedy
it
would
not.
justice
kennedy
i
think
that
in
other
states
it
would,
although
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
and
if
that's
so
then
my
next
question
would
be
if
there
would
be
issue
preclusion
going
back
the
other
way,
if
the
tort
were
tried
first,
i
assume
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
due
process
at
least
for
a
domestic
court,
say,
that
this
has
already
been
litigated
and
it's
going
to
accept
those
findings.
justice
kennedy
what
is
your
answer
if
a
child
is
battered,
receives
severe
injuries
and
sues
for
medical
payments,
sues
the
father
through
a
next
friend?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
this
is
a
child
suing
the
parent.
justice
kennedy
in
another
sense
that
doesn't
help
you,
though,
because
if
the
federal
court
enters
a
judgment
making
certain
findings
as,
let's
say
the
child
abuse
did
occur,
if
the
proceeding
is
always
open
in
louisiana
and
if
louisiana
does
not
give
preclusive
effect
to
that
determination,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
louisiana
court
remains
unfettered
and
unconstrained
by
the
federal
judgment.
justice
kennedy
but
the
state
court
is
just
as
free
as
it
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
no
federal
proceeding
at
all,
as
i
understand
both
your
submission
and
that
of
your
opposing
counsel.
justice
kennedy
he
could
never
get
custody
back.
