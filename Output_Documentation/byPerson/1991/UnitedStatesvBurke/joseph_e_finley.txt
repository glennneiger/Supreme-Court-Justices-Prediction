mr.
joseph
e.
finley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
detected
at
the
outset
a
really...
misstatement
of
the
question
presented
that
has
veered
from
what
i
thought
we
addressed
in
our
briefs.
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
and
for
the
government
talked
about
it
as
a
accession
to
wealth
or
gross
income
case.
we
all
agree
that
it
would
be
an
accession
to
wealth.
this
is
a
question
of
exclusion
by
section
104(a)(2)
from
taxation.
it's
an
exclusion
case.
and
to
reach
the
exclusion
case,
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute,
and
that's
where
this
case
begins.
and
the
regulation
that
follows
thereunder.
and
the
statute
says
in
language
that
one
may
think
clear
until
we
start
bouncing
it
around,
but
the
statute
says,
excluding
the
amount...
the
amount...
of
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
now,
a
regulation
follows--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--yes,
but
sickness
wasn't
involved
in
this
case,
and
i'm
trying
to
confine
it
to
this
case
and
the
scope
of
the
problem.
now,
the
regulation
comes.
it's
the
government's
regulation,
not
ours,
a
regulation
which
we
are
entitled
to
follow
and
entitled
to
honor
because
the
regulation
is
in
accord
with
the
statutory
language.
and
the
regulation
helps
to
expound
and
expand
what
is
excluded.
and
26
cfr
1-104-1(c)
excludes
the
amount
of
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
then
it
goes
further
to
make
an
express
definition.
the
term
damages
received
means
an
amount
received...
we're
not
talking
about
legal
or
equitable;
it's
an
amount
received...
through
prosecution
of
a
legal
suit
or
action.
through
prosecution
of
an
action.
in
this
case,
the
underlying
case
was
an
action
brought
in
court
to
redress
the
wrong
of
sexual
discrimination.
and
it
says,
through
prosecution
of
a
legal
suit
or
action
based
upon
a
tort
or
tort-type
rights.
and
we
suggest
and
argue
and
present
that
the
inquiry
must
be
focused
on
those
terms,
used
by
congress,
and
used
by
the
treasury.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
fit
exactly
into
the
statutory
language
and
the
regulation,
point
by
point,
step
by
step.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--well,
if
they
are
relying
on
personal
injuries,
and
i
struggle
to
determine
what
their
position
really
is.
in
the
reply
brief,
the
government
says
that
we
can't
establish
that
a
personal
injury
was
involved.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
analogy
may
be
drawn
readily
from
this
court's
ruling
in
goodman
v.
lukens
steel.
and
this
poses
a
hypothetical
to
which
i
don't
believe
the
government
has
an
answer.
and
in
fact,
its
whole
argument
treats
goodman
v.
lukens
steel
as
it
never
existed.
in
goodman
v.
lukens
steel,
there
was
a
combined
section
1981
case
and
a
title
vii
case.
it
was
the
same
wrong,
the
same
injury
complained
of.
the
case
proceeded
under
section
1981
through
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
obviously
there
was
a
wider,
broader
remedy.
now
this
court
has
held,
and
it's
undisputed,
that
in
section
1981
claims
and
title
vii
claims,
the
gravamen
of
the
injury
is
the
same,
the
proof
required
is
the
same,
the
treatment
is
the
same.
and
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
only
difference
in
those
statutes
in
application
in
a
practical
world
is
the
actual
remedy.
now,
this
court
earlier
said
in
davis
v.
passman
that
you
must
separate
the
wrong
from
the
remedy.
and
that's
what
we
believe
clearly,
clearly
the
statute
provides
and
the
regulation.
now
to
answer
your
question
further,
justice
scalia,
and
go
back
to
the
1981
analogy,
in
our
particular
case...
let's
take
that.
if
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
had
been
black
persons
instead
of
females,
they
could
have
brought
the
same
action
under
section
1981.
the
same
wrong
would
be
complained
of,
the
same
proof
would
have
been
necessary,
and
the
result...
let's
say
the
outcome
or
the
settlement
was
based...
same
dollars,
same
everything
else,
except
this
is
under
section
1981.
so
the
question
becomes
if
a
violation
of
section
1981
is
a
personal
injury,
there...
and
it's
also
a
part
of
title
vii,
discrimination
is
a
personal
injury.
and
this
court
in
goodman
made
a
ringing
affirmation
that
discrimination
is
a
personal
injury.
and
it
cannot
be
said
otherwise.
and
i
can't
understand
the
government
saying
otherwise.
and
so
the
government
has
not
unequivocally
answered
the
question,
was
a...
is
a
violation
of
title
vii
a
personal
injury.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
in
goodman?
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
it
was
racial
discrimination,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
the
question
obviously
in
the
case
was
a
statute
of
limitations
question.
that
was
the--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--that
is
correct.
and
the
court
first
had
to
decide...
if
it
was
a
personal
injury,
you
apply
the
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
goodman
v.
lukens
steel.
the
court
made
that
decision,
and
affirmatively
stated
that
it
was
indeed
a
personal
injury.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes,
sir.
my
answer
is
clear
cut
and
unequivocal
on
that.
it
does
because
we
are
addressing...
and
we
come
back
again
to
104(a)(2),
which,
as
the
inquiry
before
the
court
today...
because
it
is
a
commission
of
a
tort
or
tort-type
right
created
by
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
don't
know
how
the
government...
i
don't
believe
it's
entitled
to
deference.
if
it
departs
from
what
the
regulation
states,
and
it's
doing
that
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes,
it
is
saying
that,
but
where
is
the
support
for
it?
i
see
no
support
because
the
language
is
clear
and
unequivocal,
and
we
follow
that
language
that
it's
an
amount
received
based
upon
a
tort
or
tort-type
right.
and
the
court
has
held,
and
that's
why
the
goodman
v.
lukens
steel
is
so
important.
we
come
back
to
davis
against
passman,
where
the
court
found
that
a...
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
was
a
violation
of
a
personal
right.
and
the
remedy
was
somewhat
different.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
we
can
think
of...
the
right
to
contract--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--it
doesn't
come
under
the
statute
because
it's
not
a
tort-type
right.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
a
right
that
inures
to
the
person
as
a
human
being
in
the
eyes
of
the
law.
and
the
law
is
going
to
establish
what
that
right
means.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
it
might
be
a
contract
right
but...
because
the
contract
right
is
not
involved
in
what
we
are
confronted
with,
the
exclusionary
language
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
it
would
in
that
sense
inure
the
person.
but
i
don't
think,
again,
it
resolves
the
question
before
us
here
in
this
case,
because
we
are
dealing...
and
we
must
come
back
to
that
over
and
over
again,
because
the
statute
and
the
regulation
and,
whether
the
government
tries
to
interpret
it
differently
or
not,
we
still
have
a
definition
of
an
amount
received
through
prosecution
of
a
legal
suit
or
action
based
upon
a
tort
or
tort-type
claim.
and
the
underlying
claim
in
this
case
was
a
claim
of
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
your
honor,
i
would
apply
the
national
labor
relations
act
situation
and
look
at
it
to
ask
the
question
is
it
a
tort
or
tort-type
right.
and
in
that
context,
to
answer
you
specifically,
i
think
that
question
ought
to
be
revisited,
and
we
could
find
and
hold
that
it
is
a
personal
injury.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
it's
more
nearly
in
the
contract
area,
but
it
could
be.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
sir?
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
it
would
broaden--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--in
past
holdings
and
past
rulings?
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
the
only
court
decision--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--i
would
not
agree
to
that.
i
would
not
agree
to
that.
because
i
don't
think
that
question's
been
answered
as
yet.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
in
practice,
that's
been
the
case.
and
the
situation
here,
as
mr.
minear
pointed
out,
as
i
have
experienced,
since
this
case
was
brought,
the
law
has
been
in
an
evolving
state.
and
the
cases
have
been
coming
down,
and
there's
been
an
examination
and
reexamination
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
as
the
full
tax
court
did
just
a
few
months
ago
in
the
downey
case...
which
again,
the
government
seems
to
ignore
because
the
tax
court
in
the
downey
case
in
july
or
august
of
1991,
after
this
case
was
decided,
reviewed
the
history
of
104(a)(2),
the
purposes
of
it,
exclusion,
the
place
where
you
start
the
inquiry,
and
incidentally,
concluded
over
and
over
again
that
the
burke
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
our
case
here,
was
rightly
decided
and
the
basis
of
the
tax
court's
treatment
in
the
future
should
be
these
standards
set
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
and
the
tax
court
reversed
a
string
of
prior
holdings
in
the
downey
case.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
if
they
can
be
defined
as
personal
injuries,
they
meet
the
statutory
and
the
regulatory
language,
and
then
the
problem
becomes--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
they
are
not
personal
injuries.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
or
a
tort
case
interference
with
contractual
relations?
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
a
tougher
example,
you
see,
because--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--and
i
would
go
back
in
a
comparative
sense
to
goodman
v.
lukens
steel,
even
though
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
appropriately
pointed
out
and
we
agreed,
that
was
a
statute
of
limitations
case,
but
the
analysis
of
this
court
in
that
case
because
the...
section
1981
dealt
with
contract
rights,
and
the
petitioners
there,
who
sought
to
extend
the
limitations
to
6
years
for
contract
rights,
were
arguing
this
was
basically
a
contract
situation.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
because
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
yes.
we
go
to
the
personal
injury
aspect
of
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
yes,
because
it
was
for
invidious
discrimination
based
on
race.
that's
why
it
becomes
a
personal
injury.
and
invidious
discrimination
under
title
vii
on
race,
just
as
section
1981
is
based
on
race,
and
title
vii
goes
further,
and
of
course,
sex,
national
origin,
religion,
and
even
to
the
age
discrimination
cases
under
another
statute,
which
the
government
seeks
to
wipe
out
here
as
well.
and
it's...
that
is
the
personal
nature
of
the
injury
as
this
court
has
pointed
out.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
because,
your
honor,
these
are
the
consequences
of
the
injury
that
the
government
has
focused
on
wrongfully.
and
as
this
court
held
in
albemarle
paper
v.
moody,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
of
the
title
vii
statute
is
to
compensate
and
make
whole
the
injured
person.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
it
is
the...
we
must
establish,
and
in
this
case...
i,
as
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
to
establish
that
there
was
a
wrong
committed
by
the
defendant
tva,
that
tva
had
discriminated
against
these
employees
based
upon
their
sex.
and
we
were
able
to
present
proof
to
the
district
court
that
this
was
indeed
so.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
would
agree
with
the
second
part
of
your
postulate,
that
there
is
these
differences,
but
i
don't
think
my
case
suffers
from
it
because
we
are
back
again
talking
about
remedies.
and
we
have
again,
and
i'll
move
to
a
point
which
i
think
is
important
in
the
case,
and
maybe
further
responsive
to
your
honor's
question.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
he
would
not
get
back
pay
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
not
under...
prior
to
the
amendment,
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
this
is
a
limitation
of
remedy.
again,
a
question
addressed
to
congress,
and
congress
addressed
it
in
1991
after
this
case
arose,
and
it
addressed
it
in
such
a
way--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--as
it
does
right
now,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
under
the
new
statute,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--oh,
yes,
your
honor,
yes,
you're
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
on
that
component
of
the
injury,
you're
correct,
your
honor.
now,
to
go
back
to
this
whole
question
here,
and
here
again
is
where
the
scope
of
the
exclusion
comes
in
in
equality
of
treatment.
in
the
ordinary
personal
injury
torts
case,
the
victim
is
recompensed
for
a
portion
of
lost
wages
or
lost
earnings.
and
those
are
clearly
not
subject
to
tax.
and
using
again
the
lipelt
case
that
this
court
decided,
an
fela
case,
where
the
employer
visits
an
injury
upon
the
employee,
in
that
wrongful
death
case,
the
extension
of
earnings...
and
that's
all
there
was,
was
the
lost
earnings
this
individual
was
deprived
of
by
his
loss
of
life...
the
court--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--he
did
not.
that
is
correct.
he
could
not.
and
even
in
the
refusal
to
hire
example
that
your
honor
had
raised
before,
the
employee
doesn't
perform
any
services.
the
government
argued
services
he
would
have
performed
had
he
been
properly,
or
she
properly
hired,
but
that
becomes,
again,
irrelevancy
of
dealing
with
an
amount
received
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
the
gravamen
of
our
case
was
a
discrimination
visit
on
the
persons
affected,
which
congress
allowed
a
remedy
for
at
that
time
of
back
pay
in
the
monetary
sense.
and
it
still
fits
within
the
statutory
definition
and
the
regulations
definition.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
that
were
the
consequences,
your
honor.
that
were
the
consequences.
but
as
this
court
has
held,
and
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
meritor
savings
case
pointed
this
out
very
nicely
about
the
emotional
effects
of
discrimination
upon
a
victim.
now,
congress
didn't
provide
a
remedy
for
it
at
that
time,
and
congress
provided
a
remedy
of
back
pay,
which
was
all
we
could
claim
in
our
prayer
for
relief.
the
gravamen
of
the
case,
however,
which
had
to
be
demonstrated
and
proved,
was
the
wrongful
discrimination
of
the
employer.
and
in
our
prayer
for
relief,
we
prayed
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees,
too,
but
that
didn't
convert
this
into
a
case
for
attorney's
fees.
the
monetary
remedy
we
were
entitled
to
receive
at
that
time
was
limited
to
a
back
pay
award.
and
we
settled
that
case.
and
this--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--no,
sir.
we
had
that
very...
this
arose
in
this
case.
i
faced
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
not
with
the
proof
i
had,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
i
could
not
have
lost
in
that
modicum
of
proof.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
i
argued
that
case
before
the
court,
the
lost
wages
were
never
discussed
in...
at
all
except
that
it
was
the
incident
thereof.
we
were
confronted
with...
on
the
summary
judgment
aspect
of
the
case,
we
were
confronted
with
a
problem:
did
tva
commit
the
wrong
alleged
in
the
complaint
of
discrimination.
and
that's
what
the
plaintiffs
had
to
prove
and
make
a
showing
on,
and
which
we
did.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
to
go
back
to
the
realities
of
this
case,
what
happened,
we...
the
summary
judgment...
the
cross
motions
focused
entirely
on
discrimination.
and
we
would
have
as
a
practice,
since
i
think
after
the
court
ruled,
if
we
had
gone
into
the
remedy,
remedial
portions.
we
had
a
number
of
things
to
talk
about,
one
of
which
was
an
award
of
back
pay
as
remedial,
which
followed
after
the
whole
issue.
the
gravamen
of
the
case
was
resolved
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination
involving
a
personal
injury
under
the
statute
here.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
your
honor,
they
did
because
there
were
a
minority,
a
small
number
of
men
in
the
salary
schedule
who
were
also
wage-depressed
because
of
what
tva
had
done.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
in
the
emotional
sense,
no,
but
they
were
the...
they
were
the
peripheral
victims.
they
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
whole
gravamen
of
the
case.
before
i--
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
--well,
the
males
could
not
have
brought
the
discrimination
case
in
the
first
instance,
but
those
who
happened
to
be
in
the
salary
schedule
profited.
yes,
they
did.
now,
there
is
another
factor
here
which
i
think
ought
to
be
addressed.
employers
in
this
country
need
to
have
the
question
resolved
because
they
will
be
caused
to
expend
far
more
monies
if
these
proceeds
are
taxable,
and
the
need
to
settle
these
cases,
which
congress
has
specifically
addressed
itself
to,
will
be
greatly
furthered
by
the
fact
that
if
these
proceeds
are
not
taxable,
cases
will
be
easier
and
more
readily
resolved.
mr.
joseph
e.
finley
well,
if
you
want
to
call
it
to
that
extent,
yes.
except,
once
again,
i
go
back
to
the
statute
in
an
argument
addressed
to
congress,
not
to
this
court.
and
the
government's
other
theory,
which
hasn't
been
discussed
here
today,
on
human
capital,
which
a
number
of
us
have
struggled
with
to
understand,
if
adopted
would
spawn
a
vast
scope
of
litigation
as
to
what
it
is,
what
it
means,
where
does
it
go.
and
i
hope
to
conclude
by
and
wish
to
conclude
by
again
referring
to
the
basics
of
this
case.
the
facts
of
this
case
fit
the
statute
and
the
regulation
hand
in
glove,
which
entitles
the
taxpayers
here
to
be
exempt
under
the
statute.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
quite
correctly
held,
that
when
we
inquire
as
to
the
personal
injury,
we
satisfy
that.
amount
received
is
satisfied
by
the
regulation,
the
statute.
and
therefore,
exclusion
from
104(a)(2).
and
there
it
is.
thank
you,
your
honors.
