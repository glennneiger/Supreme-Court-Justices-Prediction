justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
first
one
is
no.
91-42,
united
states
against
burke.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
settlement
of
a
sex
discrimination
case
under
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
and
under
that
settlement,
the
tennessee
valley
authority
paid
backpay
to
affected
employees.
it
withheld
federal
income
taxes
from
that
backpay.
the
irs
disallowed
the
respondent's
claim
for
refund
of
the
taxes
so
withheld.
in
a
refund
action,
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
settlement
proceeds
could
not
be
excluded
from
gross
income
as,
to
use
the
words
of
the
statute,
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
the
sixth
circuit,
however,
reversed
and
it
held
that
the
discrimination
was
a
personal
and
tort-like
injury.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
these
backpay
awards
in
settlement
of
title
vii
claims
are
not
excludable
from
gross
income
under
section
104(a)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter
each
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment,
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
