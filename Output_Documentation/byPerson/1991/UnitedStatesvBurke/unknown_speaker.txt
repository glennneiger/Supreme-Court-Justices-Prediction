unknown
speaker
what
if
the
taxpayer
had
been
wrongfully
dismissed
because
of
race
or
sex
and
then
sued
to
get
back--
unknown
speaker
--be
payment
for
services?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not
have
provided
any
services.
unknown
speaker
you're
playing
with
words,
it
seems
to
me.
of
course...
i
mean,
you
can
say
he
remained
in,
quote,
in
the
service
of
the
employer,
but
did
not
provide
any
services.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
give
the
same
answer
if
there
were
a
physical
injury
caused
to
an
employee
and
the
recovery
is
measured
on
the
basis
of
lost
wages?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
a
suit
for
sexual
harassment?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
new
legislation
are
you
going
to
have
to
face
that
question?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
position
you
would
take?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
treasury
regulation
puts
forward
the
same
approach
that
you're
urging
us
to
adopt
here?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
read
that
way.
it
says
the
phrase
damages
received
means
an
amount
received
through
prosecution
of
a
legal
suit
based
on
tort
or
tort-type
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
a
suit
brought,
as
in
this
case
under
title
vii,
a
suit
for
damages
based
on
a
tort-type
right?
unknown
speaker
can't
you
get
damages
as
a
form
of
relief?
unknown
speaker
so,
mr.
minear,
if
congress
in
enacting
title
vii
had
provided
for
damages
for
this
sort
of
discrimination
and
allowed
a
jury
trial
so
that
albemarle
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
then
this
award
would
be
excluded?
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
the
phrase
we're
talking
about
here
is:
on
account
of
personal
injuries
or
sickness.
why
did
the
government
abandon
its
original
interpretation
of
that
in
which
personal
injuries
would
mean
physical
injuries?
i
mean,
when
you
say
personal
injuries
or
sickness,
it
seems
to
me...
the
phrase
feet
or
inches,
you
wouldn't
think
that
feet
referred
to
a
part
of
the
human
anatomy,
given
the
word
feet
as
used
with
inches.
and
when
you
say
personal
injuries
or
sickness,
i
mean,
it
obviously
connotes
to
me
physical
injuries.
unknown
speaker
and
the
government
used
to
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
why
did
it
abandon
that
high
ground
and
now
try
to
argue
that
somehow
the
word
personal
injuries
means
expenditure
of
capital?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
just
does
not
connote
that,
frankly.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
not
until
something
like
1983
that
the
government
acquiesced
in
the
proposition
that
the
phrase
goes
beyond
physical
injuries.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
logic
will
out,
mr.
minear.
it
might
have
been
a
limited
set
for
a
while,
but
logic
will
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
can
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
before
that?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
placed
heavy
reliance
on
a
decision
called
threlkeld
against
the
commissioner,
a
15
to
1
decision
of
the
tax
court.
you
don't
even
cite
that
case
in
either
your
principal
brief
our
your
reply
brief.
and
that
case
said
we
should
look
at
the
origin
of
the
claim
rather
than
the
results
in
terms
of
damages
and
the
like.
why
don't
you
have
anything
to
say
about
threlkeld?
and
what's
your
view
of
that
case
and
the
analysis
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
injury
rather
than
the
consequences
in
terms
of
damages
or
back
pay
or
results.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
really
say
that
that's
the
only
injury,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
so
even
if
he
was...
even
if
he
suffered
great
embarrassment
and
he
worried
a
lot,
lost
a
lot
of
weight,
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
and
title
vii
just
isn't
designed
to
recompense--
unknown
speaker
--so
what's
going
to...
i
suppose
we'll
have
another
case
up
here
under
the
new
act.
unknown
speaker
and
up
until
now,
the...
title
vii
has
never
allowed
recovery
for
emotional
distress.
unknown
speaker
under
the
new
statute,
mr.
minear,
is
there
a
jury
trial
provided...
under
the
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
that
change
your
position
so
that
this
would
become
legal
and
not
equitable?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
one
further
question.
you
say
that
if
it's
an
underpayment
of
wages,
that's
the
easy
case.
and
then
you
answered
justice
scalia
by
saying
if
there
was
also
a
discharge,
you'd
treat
it
the
same.
what
about
a
refusal
to
hire?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
under
the
new
statute
we
got
a
refusal.
would
you
draw
a
different...
analytically,
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
refusal
to
hire
and
a
discharge?
unknown
speaker
for
work
performed.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
doesn't
cover
the
discharge,
either.
unknown
speaker
he's
constructively
working.
unknown
speaker
but
you
couldn't
say
he's
constructively
working
in
he'd
never
been
hired.
that's
why
i
asked
the
next
question.
unknown
speaker
xxx
have
to
be
right
now.
unknown
speaker
what
all
this
suggests,
at
least,
is
if
we're
looking
for
bright
lines,
i
suppose
your
opponent
has
a
brighter
line
than
you
do.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
finley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
or
sickness.
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley,
the
government
says,
and
i
think
accurately,
that
that
definition
is
just
a
definition
of
damages,
that
the...
the
regulation
that
you
read.
and
they're
not
relying
for
their
point
in
this
case
upon
the
word
damages,
although
the
d.c.
circuit
in
a
recent
case
did.
they
are
relying
on
the
words
personal
injuries.
unknown
speaker
so
that
definition
really
doesn't
help
you.
it's
a
definition
of
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
finley,
in
what
context
was
the
statement
used
in
the
case
you're
referring
to...
the
discrimination
is
a
personal
injury?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
what
was
the
question
the
court
was
answering?
unknown
speaker
so
they
were
trying
to
decide
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
the
personal
injury
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
a
statement
like
that
in
a
case
where
we're
trying
to
find
the
proper
statute
of
limitations
and
states
categorize
statutes
of
limitations...
frequently
one
will
be
for
personal...
necessarily
carries
over
body
and
soul
into
this
area
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
but
there
you're
relying
on
the
regulation,
of
course.
now
the
government
interprets
the
regulation
differently
than
you
do.
under
our
cases,
isn't
it...
isn't
the
government
entitled
to
some
deference
for
the
way
it
interprets
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
it's
saying
what
it
thinks
the
regulation
means.
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
any
rights
that
are
not
personal,
mr.
finley?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
a
personal
right?
unknown
speaker
well...
but
you're
using
language
from
davis
against
passman,
in
which
you
say
the
court
said
it
was
a
personal
right.
and
i'm
asking
you
isn't
it
rather
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
right
that
isn't
personal?
what
does
personal
right
mean?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
would
be
a
right
that
is
not
personal
under
that
definition?
unknown
speaker
a
right
to
contract
would
not
be
a
right
that
inures
to
the
person?
to
whom
would
it
inure,
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley,
what
if...
is
it
any
more
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
or
any
less
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
a
damages
on
account
of
personal
injuries
if,
instead
of
being
discharged...
wrongfully
discharged
by
reason
of
sex,
a
plaintiff
is
wrongfully
discharged
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
could.
i
think
probably
minimum
wage,
failure
to
pay
someone
a
minimum
wage.
that
seems
to
me
a
tortious
act,
too.
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
how
much
tax
money
are
talking
here?
do
we
have
any
idea?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
if
we--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
recategorize
all
of
these
things
as
damages
on
account
of
personal
injuries...
i
mean,
all
those
have
been
excluded:
minimum
wage
violations,
nlra
violations.
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
these
categories
have
been
excluded?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
nlrb
cases,
wrongful
discharge.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
excluded.
they're
not
excluded...
from
taxation?
unknown
speaker
it's
been
the
practice,
though,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
actions
you
would
exclude
are
contract
actions.
do
you
have
any
other
actions
that
you
think
don't
come
within
this
principle
of
personal
injuries?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
contract
actions
don't?
unknown
speaker
they
do
not.
they
are
not
personal
injuries.
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
what
about
a
suit
for
wrongful
breach
of...
a
tort
suit
for
wrongful
breach
of
statutes,
which
some
state...
some
states
have
now.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
or
wrongful
breach
of...
of
contract.
some
states
have
a
tort
of
that,
an
intentional,
malicious,
tortious
breach
of
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
under
1981...
if
the
recovery
was
under
1981
only,
that
there
would
be
a
personal
injury,
based
on
goodman
v.
lukens
steel?
unknown
speaker
so
if
there's
a
suit
for
refusal
to
make
a
contract
under
1981,
that's
a
personal
injury?
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley,
would
we
have
an
easier
time
with
this
case
if
instead
of
focusing
on
fine
distinctions
in
personal
injury
and
fine
distinctions
about
damages,
we
focused
instead
on
the
further
requirement
under
104...
104(2),
which
speaks
of
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
can't
we
say
that
even
assuming
you
are
correct,
that
this
is
a
personal
injury
here,
the
damages
were
not
received
on
account
of
the
personal
injury,
simply
because
they
bear
no
relationship
and
the
inquiry
in
determining
them
bears
no
relationship
to
the
personal
injury
which
you
say
occurred?
in
the
award
of
the
damages,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
discrimination
was
egregious
or
not.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
person
discriminated
against
was
hurt
or
otherwise
psychologically
injured.
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
the
amount
of
the
wages.
and
since
that
bears
no
relationship
to
the
extent
of
the
personal
injury,
why
isn't
the
easy
answer
to
say
that
the
damages
are
not
awarded
on
account
of
the
injury?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
the
very
nature
of
the
statute
focuses
it
solely
on
personal
injury,
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
would
have
to
say
here
that
a
back
pay
award
is
on
account
of
the
injury
because
that
indeed
is
the
object
of
the
statute.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
your
answer
suffer
from
the
fact
that
under
the
statute,
different
kinds
of
relief
could
be
rewarded?
i
mean,
there
need
not
necessarily
be
a
back
pay
award,
and
there
could
indeed
be
equitable
relief
to
remedy
the
discrimination
without
the
payment
of
a
penny.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
finley,
suppose
a
wrongfully
discharged
employee
the
next
day
got
another
job
across
the
street,
and
making
the
same
thing,
except
he
wanted
back
his
old
job...
it
was
easier.
and
he
got
it
back.
would
he
get
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
and
he
couldn't
sue
for
emotional
distress,
could
he?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
if
he...
if
title
vii
allowed
damages
for
personal
injury--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
allow
a
suit
for
emotional
distress.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
case
it
did
not
allow
a
suit
for
emotional
distress.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
in
my
example,
if
title
vii
had
allowed
a
suit
for
emotional
distress,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
that
he
worked
across
the
street
and
didn't
lose
any
pay.
unknown
speaker
but
usually
in
that
kind
of
case,
the
employee
does
not
perform
the
services
for
which
the
compensation
is
paid.
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley,
what
about
distinguishing
those
cases
on
the
ground
that
there
the
economic
injury,
the
loss
of
wages
is
consequential
to
the
real
injury,
which
is
a
personal
injury.
it's
the
loss
of
an
arm,
some
physical
injury.
and
these
things
are
consequential.
but
the
personal
injury
is
not
an
economic
injury,
whereas
in
your
case,
the
only
real
injury
that's
being
sued
for
is
initially
an
economic
injury.
the
gravamen
of
the
whole
complaint
is
not
the
loss
of
an
arm;
it's
simply
the
loss
of
wages.
i
think
that's
the
distinction
the
government
is
trying
to
make
between
those
two
cases.
unknown
speaker
discrimination
in
the
air
is
no
injury.
the
injury
in
this
case
was
that
the
person
hadn't
been
paid
as
much
as
others
because
of
the
discrimination.
so
it
was
an
economic
injury
to
start
off
with.
it
was
not
a
personal
injury.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
facing
a
question
of
summary
judgment
on
liability
only,
and
the
only
thing
that
you
supported
was
the
claim
of
discrimination,
you'd
lose,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
should
have
lost,
shouldn't
you
have?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
in
fact--
unknown
speaker
--in
fact
you
put
in
the
lost
wages,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
was
that
because
they
simply
disputed
the
discrimination
or
because
you
had
simply
alleged
discrimination
as
the
sole
basis
for
liability,
leaving
damages
for
another
issue?
which
was
it?
because
if
it
was
the
first
alternative,
then
clearly
you
know,
if
you
had
any
evidence
of
discrimination,
you
should
have
won.
if
it's
the
second
alternative,
it
focuses
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
finley,
did
any
men
benefit
from
the
recovery
that
was
obtained
here
in
the
settlement?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
as
to
the
men
that
your
argument
still
stands,
that
there's
some
personal
injury
recovery
as
to
them?
unknown
speaker
it
just
seems
to
me
your
theory
doesn't
apply
as
easily
to
them.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
because
the
plaintiff
will
accept
a
smaller
award
than
otherwise
because
the
plaintiff
would
be
able
to
keep
all
the
award,
rather
than
pay
part
of
it
in
tax?
well,
that
really
means
then
the
government
would
be
subsidizing
the
thing
in
a
way,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
finley.
mr.
minear,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
