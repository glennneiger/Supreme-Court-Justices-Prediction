mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
taxpayer
must
include
in
her
gross
income
amounts
received
in
settlement
of
a
title
vii
wage
disparity
suit.
we
submit
the
settlement
award
is
gross
income
because
it
amounts
simply
to
delayed
payment
of
wages
for
services.
those
wages
should
be
taxed
in
the
same
manner
as
if
they
had
been
paid
when
earned.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
taxpayers
were
female
employees
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority.
in
1984,
the
tva
was
sued
under
title
vii
on
the
theory
that
it
had
increased
the
salaries
of
employees
in
certain
male-dominated
pay
schedules
without
providing
comparable
increases
to
employees
in
certain
female-dominated
pay
schedules.
the
complaint
sought
specific
relief
in
the
form
of
an
order
directing
tva
to
eliminate
prospectively
the
pay
disparity
and
to
provide,
quote,
back
pay
to
all
affected
female
employees
in
an
amount
sufficient
to
eliminate
discrimination.
in
1987,
the
plaintiffs
and
tva
settled
the
lawsuit
by
entering
into
a
settlement
agreement.
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
shared
in
the
settlement
proceeds.
tva
made
payments
to
them,
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
settlement
agreement,
withheld
amounts
for
social
security
and
federal
income
taxes.
the
taxpayers
then
filed
claims
for
refund
of
the
withheld
taxes.
the
internal
revenue
service
disallowed
those
claims.
the
taxpayers
then
brought
this
refund
suit.
they
argue
that
the
settlement
payments
should
be
excluded
from
gross
income
under
section
104(a)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
states
that
gross
income
does
not
include,
quote,
the
amount
of
any
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries
or
sickness.
the
district
court
rejected
their
claim;
however,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
majority
reasoned
that
title
vii
awards
constitute
damages
on
account
of
personal
injuries
or
sickness
because
injuries
resulting
from
discrimination
are,
quote,
injuries
to
the
individual
rights
and
dignity
of
the
person.
judge
wellford
dissented.
he
concluded
that
title
vii
awards
should
be
included
in
gross
income
because
they
simply
amount
to
a
payment
of
wages
for
services.
we
submit
that
judge
wellford
is
correct.
an
equitable
award
of
back
pay
is
compensation
for
services.
the
court
recognized
that
principle
in
social
security
board
v.
nierotko,
where
it
held
that
a
back
pay
award
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
subject
to
social
security
taxation.
as
the
court
stated
there,
surely
the
back
pay
is
remuneration.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
title
vii
back
pay,
which
was
patterned
after
the
nlra
remedy.
thus,
the
taxpayers
back--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
submit
the
same
result
would
follow.
nierotko
was--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
but
this
was
the
very
issue
that
was
involved
in
nierotko,
actually.
that
was
an
unlawful
discharge
case
also.
and
in
nierotko,
the
court
held
that
the
person
remained
in
the
service
of
the
employee
where
he
had
been
wrongfully
discharged.
the
court
stated
that
services
are...
that
one
remains
to
provide
services
even
though
one
might
not
be
active.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
correct.
but
that
was
the
issue
that
this
court
faced
in
nierotko
and
decided
that
in
fact
those
were
wages
for
services.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
we
would
not.
that
is
the
very
distinction
we
draw
between
personal
injuries
and
wages
for
services.
that
where
a
person
is
unable
to
perform
the
service,
that
he
has
been
disabled,
in
those
cases
he's
receiving
damages
by
the
amount
of
the
lost
wages.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
those
cases,
title
vii
did
not
provide
a
monetary
remedy
for
those
types
of
cases
in
the
past.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
suspect
that
we
will
face
that
question.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
believe
that
the
irs
has
had
an
opportunity
to
formulate
a
formal
position
on
that,
but
i
think
the
same
principles
would
be
applied
in
this
case.
we
would
look
to
whether
there
has
been
what
amounts
to
a
capital
loss
of
some
kind
for
the...
on
behalf
of
the
employee.
if
the
employee,
for
instance,
suffered
emotional
injury,
that
is
a
type
of
injury
that
is
recognized
by
the
service
as
being
within
the
104(a)(2)
exclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
i
think
that
that
regulation
is
referring
specifically
to
what
we
mean
by
the
term
damages
received.
it's
not
speaking
to
what
we
mean
by
a
personal
injury.
and
i
think
the
important
distinction
that
that
regulation
is
making...
which,
by
the
way,
appears
on
page
12
of
our
reply
brief...
the
important
distinction
that
that
regulation
is
making
is
between
a
damage
remedy
and
a
remedy
for
equitable
relief,
for
specific
relief.
it
says
the
term
damages
received
means
an
amount
received
through
prosecution
of
a
legal
suit
or
action
based
on
tort
or
tort-type
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
instead,
your
honor,
that
is
a
suit
for
equitable
relief,
for
specific
relief.
what
title
vii
provides
is
an
equitable
remedy
for
specific
relief
in
the
form
of
reinstatement
and
an
additional
award
of
back
pay.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this...
i
would
look
to
the
same
distinction
that
this
court
drew
in
bowen
v.
massachusetts
between...
the
term
damages
and
the
term
specific
relief.
damages
are
provided
as
a
monetary
substitute
for
a
loss,
while
specific
relief
is
provided
as
the
very
thing
to
which
the
plaintiff
is
entitled.
and
in
fact,
in
bowen,
the
majority
opinion
used
the
back
pay
award
as
an
example
of
that
type
of
specific
relief
where
a
monetary
award
is
provided.
now
as
i
was
saying,
the
taxpayers'
back
pay
award
in
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
internal
revenue
code's
definition
of
income,
which
expressly
includes
compensation
for
services.
and
the
only
question
then
is
whether
some
other
provision
of
the
code
nevertheless
removes
back
pay
from
that
definition.
as
a
starting
point,
we
note
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
exclusions
from
income
must
be
express
and
not
implied.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
even
express
exclusion
should
be
construed
with
restraint
in
light
of
congress's
policy
to
tax
comprehensively.
now
there
is
no
express
exclusion
for
title
vii
back
pay
awards,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appears
erred
in
construing
section
104(a)(2)
as
providing
that
kind
of
exclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
necessarily.
that
only
passes
the
first
hurdle
here.
the
question
in
front
must
first
be
damages.
and
it
also
must
be
received
as
compensation
for
personal
injuries
or
sickness.
so
there
still
would
have
to
be
a
determination
whether
the
damages
were
received
as
compensation
for
personal
injury.
and
that
would
be
the
remaining
question.
and
that
would
depend
on
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
took
that
position
in
1920,
i
think.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
the
original--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
that
point.
it
becomes
even
stronger
when
one
looks
to
the
original
language
of
the
1918
statute.
and
in
1920,
based
on
that
language,
the
irs
took
the
position
that
personal
injuries
meant
physical
injuries.
however,
that
same
year,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
eisner
v.
macomber,
and
that
indicated,
at
least
suggested,
that
income
for
purposes
of
the
sixteenth
amendment
referred
only
to
gains
from
labor
or
capital.
the
irs,
looking
at
that
definition,
reconsidered
this
question,
and
it
said,
well,
regardless
of
what
what
is
now
section
104(a)(2)
might
say,
this
wouldn't
be
income
in
any
regard
because
a
damage
award
is
not
a
gain
from
labor
or
capital.
that
is
the
approach
that
continued.
in
other
words,
that
the
exclusion
here
just
became
irrelevant,
based
on
the
service's
view
of
the
meaning
of
income.
that
question
was
finally
resolved
in
1955,
when
this
court
decided
glenshaw
glass,
and
made
clear
that
income
includes
all
accessions
to
wealth.
nevertheless,
the
interpretation
of
personal
injury
somehow
carried
on.
and
i
think
the
best
example
of
this
was
a
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
actually
the
first
case...
that
was
the
first
court
of
appeals
opinion,
roemer,
the
ninth
circuit
case,
i
think
is
the
first
court
of
appeals
case
where
that
was
squarely
decided.
it
also
arose
in
a
tax
court
case
in
1972
called
say
v.
commissioner.
now
perhaps
the
irs
made
the
mistake
of
not
pressing
that
argument
further
and
continuing
to
draw
the
line
between
physical
injuries
and
other
types
of
injuries.
however,
by
that
time
there
had
been
this
accumulation
of
practice,
you
know,
from
the...
as
a
result
of
the
original
eisner
decision.
and
the
irs
instead
decided
to
expand
slightly
the
definition
of
personal
injury
to
include
what
are
analogous
nonphysical
injuries.
and
it
was
a
limited
set
until
the
last
few
years.
this
included
only
defamation
or
injury
to
in
the
case
of
emotional
distress.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
true
and
that
is
a
difficulty
we
continue
to
struggle
with.
nevertheless,
that
is
the
position
the
internal
revenue
service
has
taken.
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
just
clarify
a
few
points
with
respect
to
this
distinction
between
damages
and
specific
relief,
because
i
do
think
it's
important.
and
it
is
reflected
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
recent
decision
in
sparrow
v.
commissioner.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
the
threlkeld,
at
its
most
general
level,
that
you
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
injury,
i
think
is
correct.
and
we
do
distinguish
between--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--why,
and
it's
that
latter
point
that
i
have
some
difficulty
with
here,
because
i
think
that
leads
to
a
certain
amount
of
confusion.
the
question
in
threlkeld,
it
was
attempting
to
deal
with
a
difficulty
that
had
originally
arisen
in
the
roemer
tax
court
decision.
and
in
roemer
the
tax
court
had
tried
to
make
a
distinction
between
personal
reputation
and
business
reputation,
saying
that
one
could
get
an
exclusion
for
injuries
to
one's
personal
reputation,
but
not
to
one's
business
reputation.
and
what
threlkeld
did,
and
i
think
quite
correctly,
was
eliminate
that
distinction
and
said
no,
we
simply
look
to
the
fact
that
there
was
an
injury
to
one's
reputation.
that's
as
far
as
we
need
to
go.
and
i
think
that's
what
threlkeld
really
stands
for.
judge
wellford
makes
this
very
point
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below.
but
i
think
that
it's
mistaken
to
suddenly
to
exclude
any
consideration
of
what
type
of
injury
was
actually
suffered
here,
and
that's
how
it
is
being
used
by
respondents,
i
believe.
the
injury
that
was
actually
suffered
in
this
case
was
a
underpayment
of
earnings.
the
female
employees
were
not
paid
as
much
as
their
male
counterparts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that
was
the
only
injury
that
title
vii
provides
recompense
for.
and
i
think
that's
significant,
too,
that
the
settlement
award
has
to
based
on
the
cause
of
action
that's
allowed
under
title
vii.
now,
title
vii
provided
for
equitable
relief
in
the
form
of
reinstatement
and
back
pay
sufficient
to
make
the
person's
earnings
whole.
the
back
pay
award
is
simply
part
of
the
specific
relief
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--title
vii
does
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--until
recently
amended,
it
was
not
designed
to
compensate
for
that.
now
the
new
provisions,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991,
actually
do
provide
a
damage
remedy.
and
as
i
said,
the
distinction
there
will
be
between
damages
that
are
in
fact
personal
injuries
and
those
that
are
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it's
always
possible
that
the
government
will
win
these
cases,
and
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
personal
injuries
aspect
of
this,
i
think
the
question
will
focus
on
what
is
the
nature
of
the
particular
injury.
if
there
is
something
akin
to
emotional
distress,
for
instance,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
irs
has
already
provided
the
proper
analogy.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
and
i
think
it's
also
interesting
to
not
that
all
of
this
entire
matter
here
is
a
matter
of
rather
recent
origin.
for
many
years,
there
was
no
question
that
back
pay
awards
under
the
nlra
were
in
fact
included
as
gross
income.
these
cases
have
all
arisen
in
the
past
few
years,
actually.
and
it's
been
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
that
a
jury
trial
is
provided.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
again,
i
think
the
question
here
is
we
shouldn't
allow
the
existence
of
a
jury
trial
to
determine
that
question
but
rather
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action
that's
provided.
and
in
the
cases
where
you're
receiving
money
as
a
substitute
for
loss,
it
seems
to
me
that
those
are
damages.
and
again,
that
only
answers
the
first
half
of
our
question.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
in
the
case
of
a
refusal
to
hire,
it
might
be
that
there's
no
monetary
award
that
title
vii
provides
under
its
equitable
remedies.
what
it
provides
would
be
in
fact
a
requirement
the
person
be
hired.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
why,
i
think
that,
again,
insofar
as
the
pay
is...
is
what
the
person
is
receiving
is
compensation
that
they
should
have
received--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--for
work
performed.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
but
in
the
discharge
cases,
i
said
in
nierotko
the
court
took
a
rather
broad
view
of
what
is
service--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--as
constructive
work.
it
might
be
appropriate--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
and
why...
i'm
not
sure
what
our
position
would
be
on
that,
quite
frankly.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that's
true.
and
in
this
case,
i
think
it
does
bear
emphasis
that
in
this
case
the
employees
did
continue
to
work
for
the
tva
and
the
back
pay
is
definitely
here,
wages
for
work
that
was
performed.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
their
bright
line,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
is
quite
far
removed
from
what
the
statutory
language
is
here,
which
is
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injury
or
sickness.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
personal
injuries
or
sickness
does
not
embrace,
as
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
it,
i
think,
every
legally
cognizable
injury.
and
that
is
the
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
their
position,
that
every
injury
would
in
fact
be
covered...
every
legally
cognizable
injury
to
an
individual
would
be
covered.
as
various
courts
and
commentators
have
observed,
the
term
personal
injury
has
a
more
limited
meaning.
and
as
a
result
of
various
tax
court
rulings,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
applied
the
term
to
certain
analogous
nonphysical
injuries,
primarily
injury
to
one's
reputation
and
injury
to
one's
emotional
well-being,
that,
like
physical
injuries,
can
be
roughly
related
to
a
loss
of
human
capital.
we
think
it's
clear,
however,
that
the
taxpayers
here
did
not
receive
that
kind
of
loss.
the
resulting
settlement
agreement
here
provided
for
specific
relief
in
the
form
of
certain
affirmative
action
and
also
back
pay.
and
the
monetary
award...
the
monetary
portion
of
that
award
clearly
compensates
wages
for
services.
now,
the
government's
position
here
is
not
only
reasonable,
it
also
consistent
with
prevailing
law
and
produces
a
just
result.
as
i
noted
earlier,
this
court
has
already
concluded
in
nierotko
that
a
back
pay
award
is
a
payment
of
wages
for
purposes
of
fica
taxation.
there
would
be...
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
that
rule
in
the
case
of
federal
income
taxation.
additionally,
the
irs
has
consistently
treated
back
pay
awards
under
other
statutes,
such
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
gross
income.
we
simply
urge
that
a
title
vii
back
pay
award
be
treated
in
the
same
manner.
and
to
hold
otherwise
would
produce
anomalous
results.
if
earnings
received
through
a
back
pay
award
had
been
paid
when
earned,
they
certainly
would
have
been
subject
to
taxation.
there's
no
reason
why
the
earnings
should
now
become
tax
exempt
simply
because
they
are
paid
at
a
later
date.
indeed,
if
the
court
of
appeals's
approach
were
followed,
the
federal
government
would
end
up
subsidizing
discrimination.
an
employer
could
engage
in
wage
discrimination,
and
if
sued
under
title
vii,
make
up
the
difference
in
wages
through
a
back
pay
award
based
on
after
tax
earning,
which
would
make
the
employee
whole...
whole.
and
it
could
then
pocket
the
taxes
that
should
have
been
paid.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
provide
that
sort
of
tax
reward
or
incentive
for
unlawful
discrimination.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.

unless
there
are
questions,
your
honor,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
