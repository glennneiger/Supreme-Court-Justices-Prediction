justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
now?
would
the
issue
that
you're
going
to
argue
be
any
different
if
the
16
plaintiffs
had
been
fired
because
they
were
all
females?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
you
leave
that,
could
i
ask
you
two
quick
questions?
first,
when
justice
scalia
had
questioned
you
before
about
under
color
of
state
law,
you
quoted
something
from
a
case,
i
think...
misuse
of
power
or...
could
you
tell...
i
missed
what
case
that
was
from.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
same
question
i
was
going
to
ask,
would
not
the
definition
which
you
read
apply
directly...
assuming
the
merits.
i
know
you
dispute
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claim,
but
wouldn't
that
apply
to
the
very
claim
we
have
before
us?
it
was
a
misuse
of
power
if
it
was
unconstitutional,
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
the
preceding
sentence
the
court
would
be...
pointed
out
that
they
were
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
to
create
a
cause
of
action
against
states,
to
be
brought
in
state
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
