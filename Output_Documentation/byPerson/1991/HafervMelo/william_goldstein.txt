mr.
william
goldstein
mr.
chief...
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
in
prior
decisions
has
used
the
expression
"official
capacity"
in
two
different
contexts.
the
first
is
to
describe
an
attribute
of
the
conduct
of
a
1983
defendant.
was
that
defendant
acting
in
his
official
capacity,
and
if
so
he
would
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
for
example,
in
west
v.
atkins
mr.
justice
blackmun
stated,
"generally
a
public
employee
acts
under
color
of
state
law
while
acting
in
his
official
capacity
or
while
exercising
his
responsibilities
pursuant
to
state
law.
"
if
a
person
is
acting
in
his
official
capacity,
he
is
certainly
acting
under
state
law.
but
official
capacity
has
also
been
used
by
the
court
to
describe
the
legal
personage
of
a
defendant
in
a
1983
case.
that
is,
is
the
defendant
being
sued
in
an
official
or
personal
capacity.
and
legal
personage
is
important
because
it
determines
where
the
real
interests
lie
in
the
case,
and
if
a
money
judgment
is
awarded,
who
will
pay
it.
justice
o'connor
in
karcher
v.
may
stated,
"the
concept
of
legal
personage
is
a
practical
means
of
identifying
the
real
interest
at
stake
in
a
lawsuit.
"
"we
have
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
real
party
in
interest
in
an
official
capacity
suit
is
the
entity
represented
and
not
the
individual
office-holder.
"
and
justice
o'connor
cited
kentucky
v.
graham
and
brandon
v.
holt
for
that
proposition.
the
expression
"official
capacity",
then,
can
have
two
meanings.
it
can
be
describing
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
which
occurred
before
the
lawsuit
took
place
and
which
gives
rise
to
it,
or
it
can
describe
the
legal
personage
of
the
defendant
once
the
litigation
is
under
way.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
equate
the
conduct
with
the
legal
personage,
and
to
say
that
if
the
defendant
was
acting
in
an
official
capacity,
he
or
she
can
only
be
sued
in
an
official
capacity.
and
what
that
equation
does
was
basically
to
abolish
personal
capacity
lawsuits
where
the
defendant
is
a
state
employee
or
a
state
official,
because
in
an
official
capacity
lawsuit
it
is
the
state
that
is
the
defendant,
and
we
know
that
the
state
is
not
a
person
under
1983,
and
the
state
has
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
federal
court.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
will
was
ever
intended
to
abolish
personal
capacity
lawsuits,
and
i
believe
that
will
spoke
only
in
the
context
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
recognized
to
be
an
official
capacity
lawsuit
and
which
this
court
said
in
its
opinion
was
an
official
capacity
lawsuit.
i
would
also
say
that--
mr.
william
goldstein
--in
order
to
be
an
official
capacity
suit
under
kentucky
v.
graham
it
is
necessary
to
allege
that
the
governmental
entity
was
the
moving
force
behind
the
deprivation
of
civil
rights
and
that
the
entity's
policy
and
custom
played
a
factor.
without
those
allegations,
there
can
be
no
official
capacity
liability.
so
i
would
say
that
one
thing
to
look
at
in
the
lawsuit
is
whether
the
official
capacity
allegations
are
there.
secondly,
according
to
kentucky
v.
graham,
if
you're
proceeding
in
an
official
capacity
lawsuit,
then
you
would
give
notice
to
the
governmental
entity
and
you
would
give
them
an
opportunity
to
defend.
in
this
case,
the
governmental
entity
was
not
notified.
only
barbara
hafer
is
notified,
only
she
is
requested
for
damages,
and
only
she
was
involved
in
the
case.
in
addition,
there
have
been
decisions
of
this
court
in
brandon
v.
holt
and
i
believe
in
the
bender
case
where
the
court
said
that
we
can
look
to
the
subsequent
conduct
of
proceedings
if
it
is
in
doubt.
and
in
this
case
we
did
file
documents
before
the
court
entered
summary
judgment
in
which
we
specifically
said
that
we
are
proceeding
only
against
barbara
hafer
in
her
personal
capacity.
and
there
is
a
verification
in
the
records
which
appears
at
page
197
where
it
just
actually
states
that,
where
it
says,
"no
claim
for
damages
has
ever
been
made
against
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
"
"all
claims
for
damages
have
been
made
against
barbara
hafer
individually
and
in
her
individual
capacity.
"
"service
of
the
complaint
was
made
upon
barbara
hafer.
"
"no
service
was
attempted
upon
the
commonwealth
agency
or
the
pennsylvania
attorney
general's
office.
"
"no
money
has
been
sought,
and
no
claim
has
been
made
for
monetary
damages
to
be
paid
out
of
the
commonwealth's
treasury.
"
i
will
admit
that
the
initial
pleadings
are
not
paragons
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that
we
did
get
the
point
across
at
a
stage
that
was
still
reasonable
and
fair
to
the
defendant
to
know
what
the
issues
were
in
the
case.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
since
1974,
with
scheuer
v.
rhoads,
it
has
been
the
law
that
if
a
state
executive
official
personally
commits
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights,
then
that
official
can
be
held
accountable
and
made
in
his
person
to
respond
to
the
victim
to
remedy
the
right
that
has
been
wronged...
that
has
been
committed.
and
in
that
matter
the
court
actually
cited
ex
parte
young
as
authority
for
that
position,
and
the
court...
and
chief
justice
burger,
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court,
said,
"however,
since
ex
parte
young,
it
has
been
settled
that
the
eleventh
amendment
provides
no
shield
for
a
state
official
confronted
by
a
claim
that
he
has
deprived
another
of
a
federal
right
under
color
of
state
law.
"
and
further
on,
went
really
right
down
to
the
capacity
issue
and
personal
liability.
it
says
that,
young
teaches
that
when
a
state
officer
acts
under
a
state
law
in
a
manner
violative
of
the
federal
constitution,
he
comes
into
conflict
with
the
superior
authority
of
that
constitution,
and
he
is
in
that
case
stripped
of
his
official
or
representative
character
and
is
subjected
in
his
person
to
the
consequences
of
his
individual
conduct.
all
that
we
are
asking
in
this
case
is
that
barbara
hafer
be
accountable
for
the
consequences
of
her
individual
conduct,
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
if
petitioner
were
to
prevail
in
this
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
overrule
scheuer
v.
rhoads.
i
would
also
call
to
the
court's
attention
what
i
believe
to
have
been
a
unanimous
decision
in
forrester
v.
white.
forrester
v.
white
was
a
state
judge,
a
state
official
who
fired
a
probation
officer,
and
it
was
determined
that
that
firing
was
a
violation
of
the
probation
officer's
constitutional
rights.
a
personal
capacity
lawsuit
was
filed,
and
a
verdict
of
about
$
80,000
was
entered
against
the
judge.
the
judge
said
that
i
am
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
because
i
am
a
judicial
officer,
and
this
court
said
that
hiring
and
firing
is
not
the
type
of
conduct
that
will
qualify
for
an
absolute
immunity.
hiring,
firing
is
administrative,
and
we
can
tell...
or
we
think
we
know
that
back
in
1871
what
immunities
were
fairly
in
the
minds
of
congress
and
hiring
and
firing
was
not
one
of
them.
well,
what
hafer
has
done
in
this
case
is
a
hiring
and
firing
decision,
and
she
is
a
state
official.
she
is
really
seeking
an
absolute
immunity
in
this
case.
she's
saying,
i
can't
be
personally
responsible
for
my
conduct,
and
if
she
were
to
receive
an
absolute
immunity,
i
would
think
that
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
forrester
v.
white.
i
would
also
say
that
her
position
simply
is
not
supportable
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
richter
conceded
that
hafer
was
acting
under
color
of
state
law
at
the
time
she
fired
these
people.
the
statute
identifies
the
potential
defendants
in
this
case:
all
persons
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
hafer
in
her
individual
capacity
is
a
person,
and
she
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
the
statute
then
says
that
if
those
persons
commit
a
violation
of
civil
rights,
they
are
liable
for
an
action
at
law,
and
this
court
has
traditionally
held
that
an
action
at
law
is
an
action
for
damages.
so
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
if
she
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law
and
she
commits
a
violation
of
someone's
civil
rights,
at
the
very
least
she
is
liable
for
an
action
for
damages.
there
has
been
some
reference
in
petitioner's
brief
to
a
worry
about
vexatious
lawsuits.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
concept,
this
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity,
developed
to
the
final
point
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
adequately
handles
that
situation.
and
i
would
respectfully
say
to
the
court
from
the
decision
of
mitchell
v.
forsyth,
where
justice
white
stated,
"we
emphasize
that
the
denial
of
absolute
immunity
will
not
leave
the
attorney
general
at
the
mercy
of
litigants
with
frivolous
and
vexatious
complaints.
"
"under
the
standard
of
qualified
immunity
in
harlow,
the
attorney
general
will
be
entitled
to
immunity
so
long
as
his
actions
do
not
violate
clearly
established
statutory
or
constitutional
rights
which
a
reasonable
person
would
have
known.
"
justice
white
concluded,
"we
do
not
believe
that
the
security
of
the
republic
will
be
threatened
if
its
attorney
general
is
given
incentives
to
abide
by
clearly
established
law.
"
to
paraphrase
that,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
security
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
will
not
be
threatened
if
its
auditor
general
is
given
incentives
to
abide
by
clearly
established
law.
i
think
we
will
be
better
for
it.
thank
you.
