mr.
richter,
if
you're
not
acting
in
your
official
capacity,
does
1983
apply
at
all?
i
mean,
1983
requires
that
the
action
be
under
color
of
law,
under
color
of
state
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
be
under
color
of
state
law
if
you
purport
to
be
acting
only
in
your
personal
capacity?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean,
then?
what
does
it
mean,
to
be
acting
under
color
of
law,
if
it
does
not
mean
to
be
purporting
to
be
acting
officially?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
would
think
it
means.
what
do
you
think
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
read
that
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
mean
acting
officially?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
richter,
what
i
don't
understand
about
the...
the...
you
know,
the
last
hypothetical
you
gave,
you
say
when
she
fires
somebody
from
another
department
that
she
doesn't
have
control
over,
then
she
would
be
acting
in
her
personal
capacity,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
she
also...
but
she
wouldn't
have
any
authority
to
do
it,
so
she
wouldn't
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
whenever
you
say
personal
capacity,
you're
just
out
from
under
1983
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
would
in
trying
to
fire
somebody
from
another
department?
it's
clear
that
she
has
no
authority
over
that
person
in
the
other
department?
now,
you
know,
i
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
a
case
in
which
you
could
ever
get
damages
under
1983,
because
as
soon
as...
well--
