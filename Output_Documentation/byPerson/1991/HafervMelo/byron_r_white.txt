justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that's
what
they...
is
that
they
way
they
put
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
way
they
put
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
expressly
so
stated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
will
said
they
were
separate...
really,
separate
considerations.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
ex
parte
young
applies
in
1983
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i...
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
1983?
in
a
1983
case
as
with
others...
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
do
you
challenge
the...
do
you,
in
this
case,
challenge
the
order
of
reinstatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
challenge
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
were...
the
courts
below
were
wrong
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
if.
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
on
the
damages,
you
say
that
the
firing
was
an
act
under
the
officials
in
the
official's
official
capacity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
ex
parte
young
should
not
apply
to...
in
that
situation,
even
though
the
allegation
is
that
the
firing
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
how
about
on
the
damages
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
her
act
is
unconstitutional
under
ex
parte
young,
it
is
not
to
be
charged
to
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
referred
to
it
as
a
fiction.
well,
maybe
it
is,
that
if
the
person
is
acting
unconstitutionally
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
person...
the
official
is
then
a
person,
not
an
official.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
we
frequently
have
cases,
and
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
around,
where
people
are
suing
policemen
or
prison
guards
for
damages
for
violating
their
constitutional
rights
and
wanting
an
injunction
to
keep
them
from
doing
it.
there
are
a
lot
of
judgments
that
have
been
entered
against
policemen
on
the
basis
that
they
are
persons--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
they
are...
but
they
were
acting
in
their
official
capacity
just
as
surely
as
your
auditor
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
about
state
prison
guards?
