mr.
jerome
r.
richter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
following
its
reversal
of
the
entry
of
final
judgment
in
favor
of
our
client,
the
petitioner,
barbara
hafer,
by
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
although
other
claims
were
considered
by
the
courts
below
against
the
auditor
general
and
her
co-defendant,
james
west,
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania,
no
aspect
of
those
claims
is
before
this
court.
the
only
issue
before
this
court
relates
to
the
claims
against
the
petitioner
arising
out
of
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
which
is
title
42,
united
states
code,
section
1983.
the
principal
question
before
the
court
involves
the
application
of
the
court's
1989
holding
in
will
v.
michigan
department
of
state
police,
wherein
the
court
held
neither
the
state
nor
its
officials
acting
in
an
official
capacity
are
persons
under
section
1983.
the
petitioner,
the
auditor
general,
is
an
elected
official
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
the
primary
function
of
the
petitioner
is
to
ensure
that
all
the
revenues
due
to
the
commonwealth
are
collected
and
all
the
funds
so
collected
are
legally
and
properly
disbursed.
to
fulfill
that
sensitive
responsibility
the
auditor
general
supervises
a
staff
of
approximately
800
employees
consisting
of
auditors,
investigators,
and
revenue
agents.
the
auditor
general
is
vested
with
the
ultimate
statutory
authority
to
hire
and
fire
the
employees
within
that
department.
the
auditor
general
took
office
and
was
inaugurated
january
17,
1989.
shortly
thereafter,
she
fired
the
16
respondents,
8
because
they
were
ineffective
managers
and
the
other
8
because
they
were
beneficiaries
of
a
job-buying
scheme.
each
of
the
16
are
seeking
money
damages
personally
against
the
auditor
general--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--the
issue
would
be
no
different.
it
would
affect,
of
course,
perhaps
the
fact
that
there's
alternative
relief
available
under
title
vii,
but
it
wouldn't
affect
the
argument.
the
relevance,
of
course,
justice
stevens,
to
our
making
reference
to
the
facts
relating
to
the
job-buying
scheme
in
which
eight
of
the
respondents
were
the
beneficiaries
has
to
do
with
the
concern
about
the
interference
by
the
courts
into
the
internal
operations
of
state
government,
particularly
in
a
case
of
such
a
sensitive
and
public
nature
as
that
involved
in
the
job-buying
scheme.
but
to
go
on,
seven...
seven
of
the
respondents
as
union
members
pursued
and
secured
arbitration
awards.
they...
they
were
union
members,
and
as
such
they
were
entitled
to
a
grievance
procedure
which
permitted
the
arbitration
process,
and
each
of
the
seven
was
awarded
reinstatement
with
back
pay
and
interest
on
the
back
pay.
the
reason
for
the
arbitration
awards,
was
given
by
the
arbitrators,
was
that
they
grounded
their
awards
solely
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
total
lack
of...
lack
of
adequate
proof
on
the
part
of
the
auditor
general
that
the
seven
respondents
knew
that
their
jobs
were
purchased.
all
eight
beneficiaries
of
the
job-buying
scheme,
including
the
seven
with
the
awards
for
reinstatement,
are
still
pressing
1983
claims
alleging
political
discharge
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
and
their
due
process
rights
against
the
auditor
general
in
her
individual
capacity.
these
eight
have
been
consolidated,
with
james
melo
as
the
lead
plaintiff.
the
other
eight,
who
were
fired
as
ineffective
managers,
have
had
their
cases
consolidated
with
carl
gurley
as
the
lead
plaintiff.
two
of
the
gurley
respondents
have
sought
money
damages
only
from
the
auditor
general,
while
the
other
six
are
seeking
money
damages
as
well
as
reinstatement,
and
they
are
seeking
reinstatement
against
the
auditor
general
in
her
official
capacity...
excuse
me.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
there
were
11
complaints,
justice--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--in
that
one
complaint,
the
eleventh
complaint,
six
of
the
gurley
plaintiffs
have
sought
reinstatement
against
the
auditor
general
in
her
official
capacity,
and
money
damages
against
her--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--and
expressly
so
stated
in
that
one
complaint.
in
the
other
10
complaints
involving
all
of
the
other
respondents,
there
was
no
identification
of
the
capacity
in
which
they
were
pursuing
their
claims
against
the
auditor
general.
with
respect
to
the
claims
for
prospective
relief,
we
readily
concede
that
the
will
decision
affirms
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young,
and
that
a
state
official
is
a
person
for
purposes
of
injunctive
relief.
and
we
do
not
challenge
that
aspect
of
the
circuit
court's
ruling.
the
auditor
general
moved
for
summary
judgment
before
the
district
court
and
relied
on
the
will
decision,
and
set
forth
her
function
in
summary
judgment
papers
reflecting
that
she
was
acting
in
her
official
capacity,
that
she
was
the
duly
authorized
state
official
who
had
the
ability
and
authority
to
hire
and
fire
in
that
office,
and
the
district
court
concluded
in
entering
judgment
in
favor
of
the
auditor
general,
that
she
was
in
fact
acting
in
her
official
capacity.
she
therefore
was
not
a
person
under
section
1983,
and
dismissed
the
case.
the
district
court
did
not
address
the
merits
of
the
political
discharge
claims.
the
circuit
court
reversed,
treated
the
summary
judgment
as
if
it
had
been
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
while
not
addressing
the
determination
of
the
district
court
that
the
auditor
general
was
acting
in
her
official
capacity,
the
circuit
court
nevertheless
held
that
respondents
could
maintain
the
actions
against
the
auditor
general
based
simply
on
the
fact
that
they
had
asserted
that
they
were
suing
her
in
her
personal
capacity.
and
by
that,
the
circuit
court
thus
interpreted
will
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
state
officials,
sued
for
damages
in
their
personal
capacity,
are
persons
under
section
1983.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
what
this
court
held
at
all
in
the
will
decision.
on
the
contrary,
at
the
outset
of
the
will
decision,
the
court
stated
that
the
case
presented
the
question
of
whether
a
state
or
state
official,
while
acting
in
his
or
her
official
capacity,
is
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1983,
and
then
proceeded
to
answer
that
question
at
the
conclusion
in
the
negative,
wherein
the
court
stated,
"we
hold"...
and
i
quote...
"that
neither
a
state
nor
its
officials
acting
in
their
official
capacities
are
persons
under
section
1983.
"
we
submit
that
the
circuit
court
holding
was
inconsistent
with
this...
the
important
holding
in
the
will
decision,
and
if
not
reversed
will
eviscerate
the
meaning
of
the
will
case.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
yes,
your
honor.
in
our
submission--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--as...
as
we
see
the
will
decision,
your
honor,
acting
under
color
of
law
is
separate
and
apart
from
the
capacity
in
which
you
act.
and
while
it's
true
the
two
may
sometimes
converge,
there
are
different
concepts,
and
moreover--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--my
understanding
of
the
definition
of
"acting
under
color
of
law"
is
a
misuse
of
power
possessed
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
made
possible
only
because
the
wrongdoer
is
clothed
with
the
authority
of
state
law.
that
is
the
definition
of
u.s.
v.
classic
cases.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
misuse
of
power--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--possessed
by
virtue
of
state
law--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--and
made
possible
only--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--because
the
wrongdoer
is
clothed
with
the
authority
of
state
law.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
we
submit
that
it
does
not,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
one
can
be
acting
in
their
official
capacity
and
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
they
can
also
be
acting
other
than
in
their
official
capacity
and
also
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
this
court
has
consistently
been
dealing
with
the
issues
of
capacity
up
until
1989,
based
on
its
interpretation
of
the
immunities
and
the
eleventh
amendment
issues
that
drove
those
decisions.
it
was
not
until
1989
in
will,
where
the...
when
for
the
first
time
this
court
had
to
address
when
somebody
is
or
is
not
a
person
under
section
1983...
or
to
put
it
more
specifically,
when
a
state
official
is
a
person
under
1983
for
purposes
of
money
damage
suits.
and
it
was
only
then
for
the
first
time
that
it
had
to
focus
on
the
standard
of
how
one
might
be
found
to
be
a
person
or
not
under
section
1983.
the
need
to
identify
capacity
prior
to
that,
and
unrelated
to
that,
arose
out
of
the
11...
eleventh
amendment
considerations.
those
considerations
are
separate
and
apart
from
the
statutory
definition
of
"person"
that
was
addressed
in
the
will
decision.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
absolutely,
sir,
and--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--well,
ex
parte
young
was
not
a
1983
case--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--no,
i
understand,
sir,
but
ex
parte
young
in
our
submission
is
still
very
much
a
viable
doctrine.
it
was
affirmed
in--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--it
provides...
it
provides,
as
we
know,
for
prospective
relief.
it
tells
us
that
the
state
sued
through
its
officials
is
not
viewed
as
being
made
a
defendant
under
1983--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--for
the
purpose
of
that
fiction--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--but
it's
still
very
much
available
as
a
means
of
relief
under
1983.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
there
are
two
reinstatement
issues.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
there
was
no
order
of
reinstatement
entered
in
this
case.
there
was
a
dismissal--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--of
the
claims
for
reinstatement
by
the
district
judge--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--and
in
our
view
we
concede
that
if
the
court
didn't
reach
the
merits,
and
if
this
court
chooses
not
to
reach
the
merits,
then
those
six
gurley
claims
for
reinstatement
under
ex
parte
young
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
district
court,
and
we
don't
contest
that.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
if
the
court--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--that's
only
one
aspect--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--of
the
case.
our
principal
concern
is
with
the
money
damage
claims
against
the
auditor
general
personally.
the
reinstatement
claims
were
brought
by
six
gurley
respondents
against
the
auditor
general
in
her
official
capacity,
and
as
to
those
we
concede
that
unless
that's
decided
on
the
merits
or
considered
decided
on
the
merits,
it
has
to
go
back.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
the
allegation...
the
allegations
are
that
the
firings
were
unconstitutional,
but
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
ex
parte
young
is
on
a
separate
track
on
reinstatement,
and
we
suggest--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--on
the
damages
issue,
we
suggest
that
a
claim
of
political
discharge,
wherein
an
effort
is
made
to
pursue
the
state
official,
in
this
case
in
your
individual
capacity,
for
money
damages,
is
inappropriate
because
the
official
in
connection
with
hiring
and
firing
is
acting
in
her
official
capacity
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
director
of
state
police
in
will
was
acting
in
his
official
capacity,
and
as
such
ought
not...
ought
not
to
have
to
answer
personally,
with
their
personal
assets
at
risk,
under
1983--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--and
we
submit
that
in
the
will
decision,
of
course,
that
was
a
suit
against
the
director
of
state
police
in
his
official
capacity,
whereas
this
case...
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
whereas
in
this
case
the
case
comes
before
you
on
the
respondent's
assertion
that
they're
pressing
the
case
against
the
auditor
general
in
her
individual
capacity.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
that's
exactly
the
point.
she
can
fire
and
hire
those
on
the
staff
within
her
department,
and
within
her
department
alone,
and
she's
authorized
to
do
that.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
exactly.
acting
in
her
official
capacity
as
the
elected
auditor
general.
were
she,
of
course,
to
try,
for
example,
to
fire
an
employee
in
some
other
department
or
some
related
agency
and
either
directly
or
indirectly
try
to
affect
some
employment
decision,
she'd
be
acting
outside
of
her
authority,
and
in
our
submission
would
not
be
acting
in
her
official
capacity,
as
an
example--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--there--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--there
are
numerous--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--well,
justice,
there
are
numerous
instances
where
constitutional
violations
occur
by
the
state
and
the
state
is
not
answerable
in
money
damages.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
they
were
only
answerable
under
young
for
prospective
relief,
and
that's
because
the
young
doctrine
tells
us
that...
that
for
injunctive
or
prospective
relief
the
state
will
not
be...
will
be
considered
a
person.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
well,
i
beg
to
differ
with
that,
because
i
think
she
would
be
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
although
i
think
she
would
be--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--in
our
view,
sir,
the
will
case
told
us
to
look
to
the
function
of
the
state
official
in
determining
whether
or
not
they're
a
person
under
the
act.
in
our
submission,
the
determination
of
whether
a
state
official
is
going
to
be
held
personally
responsible
is
something
that
ought
to
be
determined
by
the
court
and
not
by
the
pleadings
of
the...
of
the
plaintiff
alone.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
that's
the
definition
from
u.s.
classic,
which
is
referred
to--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--from
time
to
time.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
we
don't
dispute
that
the
auditor
general
was
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
we
readily
concede
that
that
is
not...
that
element
is
not
an
issue.
our
view
is
that
the
will
case
tells
us
that
she
had
to
be
acting
outside
her
official
capacity
in
order
for
her
to
be
held
individually
responsible,
because
in
our
submission
the
will
case
tells
us
she's
acting
in
her
official
capacity.
she
is
not
a
person,
and
as
such,
can't
be
held
responsible
under
1983
personally.
i
just
wanted
to
make
a
few
more
points,
and
that
is
there
was
no
case
prior
to
the
will
decision
in
this
court
that
dealt
with
a
statutory
definition
of
whether
a
state
official
is
a
person
with
respect
to
money
damage
claims.
all
of
the
prior
decisions
that
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
deal
with
eleventh
amendment
or
immunity
issues,
and
this
court
had
specifically
made
it
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
scope
of
1983
are
separate
issues.
in
will,
for
example,
the
plaintiff
cited
kentucky
v.
graham
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
assumed
the
state
was
a
person.
but
the
will
court
in
footnote
4
rejected
that
proposition
and
stated
that
this
court
did
not
address
the
meaning
of
"person"
in
any
of
those
cases,
and
none
of
the
cases
was
resolution
of
that
issue
necessary
to
the
decision.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
reliance
on
kentucky
v.
graham
by
the
respondents
here
as
well
as
their
reliance
on
the
rhoads...
scheuer
v.
rhoads
decision
and
the
forrester
decision
is
misplaced.
the
respondents
had
argued
and
the
circuit
court
had
concluded
that
this
court
would
permit
state
officials
to
be
sued
and
to
be
liable
solely
because
they're
named
in
their
personal
capacity.
we
believe
that
this
court
intended
what
it
meant
when
it
said
"acting",
that
the
court's
repeated
and
deliberate
use
of
the
word
"acting"
in
its
holding
was
with
a
view
to
focusing
on
the
function
of
the
actions
of
the
state
official,
and
that
the
form
of
the
pleading
does
not
control
the
statutory
definition
of
"person".
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
thank
you,
sir.
just
a
few
minutes.
we
are
not
predicating
our
position
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
are
not
predicating
our
position
on
absolute
immunity
for
the
auditor
general.
we
are
saying
that
the
auditor
general
is
not,
because
of
her
conduct
in
this
case
in
hiring
and
firing,
a
person
under
section
1983.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
scheuer
v.
rhoads
or
forrester
v.
white
need
be
overruled.
on
the
contrary,
we're
suggesting
that
the
court
in
its
decision
in
will
recognized
that
those
cases
were
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence
and
that
those
cases,
each
of
them,
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
officials
acting
in
those
cases
were
acting
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
a
person
or
not
under
section
1983.
the
statutory
issue,
the
statutory
definition
of
"person",
was
never
addressed
in
any
of
those
cases
until
the
will
decision.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
in
our
position,
they...
they
have
no
right...
they
never
had
a
right
to
seek
monetary
damage
against
the
auditor
general
since
she's
acting
in
her
official
capacity
in
the
firings,
is
not
a
person,
and
their
relief
that
they
seek
ought
to
be
limited
to
either
prospective
relief
or
some
other
alternative
relief.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
that--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--well,
may
i
respond
to
that?
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
city
policemen,
under
monell,
of
course,
the
city
policemen,
as
are
the
cities,
are
identified
in
monell
as
persons
and
subject
to
damage
liability
under
1983.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
here--
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
--here
we're
only
addressing
the
function
of
hiring
and
firing
as
being
within
official
capacity.
were
we
asked
to
draw
the
line,
which
we
haven't
been,
we
would
draw
the
line
in
the
context
of
internal
operations
of
state
government.
we
would
draw
the
line,
at
the
very
least,
in
the
state
employment
context.
we
don't
think
we
have
to
go
beyond
that.
we
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
consider
the
factors
that
we
had
suggested
in
our
briefing,
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
state
official
was
acting
within
their
official
capacity
such
that
they're
not
persons,
we
would
suggest
that
special
police
power
cases,
cases
involving
the
public
at
large,
are
such
that
those
parties
are
not
acting
in
their
official
capacity.
we're
suggesting
the
definition
of
official...
acting
in
official
capacity
is
limited
under
will
at
least
to
the
facts
of
that
case,
which
have
to
do
with
employment
decisions,
with
hiring
and
firing,
with
the
internal
operations
of
state
government.
we
would
suggest
that
there
was
an
analogous
situation,
albeit
not
in
a
statutory
context,
in
bush
v.
lucas,
a
case
back
in
1983,
albeit
not
a
1983
case,
wherein
the
court
declined
to
extend
the
opportunity
to
pursue
bivens
actions
against
a
federal
employer
because
it
impacted
adversely
on
the
internal
operation
of
the
government,
and
the
court
concluded
there
was
adequate
alternative
relief
because
there
was
the
opportunity
to
pursue
claims
in
the
civil
service
context.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
again
with
respect
to
the
recitation
and
suggestion
that
the
eleventh
amendment
derives
this
result
that
that
is
a
different
issue.
the
court
made
it
very
clear...
page
66
of
the
will
opinion...
that
this
does
not
mean,
as
petitioner
suggests,
and
i
quote,
"that
we
think
that
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
scope
of
1983
are
not
separate
issues.
"
"certainly
they
are,
but
in
deciphering
congressional
intent
as
to
the
scope
of
1983,
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
consideration,
and
we
decline
to
adopt
a
reading
of
1983
that
disregards
it.
"
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
r.
richter
thank
you.
