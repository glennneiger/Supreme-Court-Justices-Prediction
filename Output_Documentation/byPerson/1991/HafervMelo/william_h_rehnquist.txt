well
hear
argument
next
in
number
90-681,
barbara
hafer
v.
james
c.
melo,
jr.--
mr.
richter,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
1983
case,
is
it
useful
to
analyze
in
what
capacity
a
public
official
acts
beyond
the
question
of
under
color
of
state
law?
don't
we
usually
just
talk
about
in
what
capacity
they're
sued,
not
in
what
capacity
they
act,
once
we've
decided
that
the
requirement
of
under
color
of
state
law
is
met?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
a
state
auditor
can't
fire
any
state
employee
other
than
in
her
official
capacity,
can
she?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
her...
acting
in
her
official
capacity
as
state
auditor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
richter.
mr.
goldstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
richter,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
view,
mr.
richter,
do
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
then
have
no
chance
of
monetary
relief
against
the
state
auditor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richter.
the
case
is
submitted.
