mr.
goodman,
is
there
any
distinction
between
a
school
that
is
small
or
underfunded
for...
as
a
result
of
educational
reasons
in
the
past
and
a
school
that
is
small
and
underfunded
as
a
result
of
prior
segregation?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
your
argument
is
that
you
cannot
or
this
court
cannot
make
judgments
or
individuals
cannot
expect
to
attend
fully-funded
or
better-funded
schools.
and
you
give
as
examples
delta
state
being
underfunded.
my
question
is
if
a
school
is
underfunded
as
a
result
of
prior
segregation
policies,
is
there
any
difference
between
that
school
and
its
current
condition
and
the
school
that
has
never
been
discriminated
against?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
your
argument
then
would
have
been
that
20
years
ago
you
had
freedom
of
choice?
