mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
many
decades
the
state
of
mississippi
created
and
then
deliberately
maintained
a
dual
system
of
higher
education:
one
for
whites,
one
for
blacks.
there
are,
to
our
mind,
at
least
three
clear
signs
that
that
system
has
not
been
dismantled.
the
first
is
the
way
students
enter
the
system:
a
discriminatory
admissions
test
that
channels
black
students
to
traditionally
black
institutions.
secondly--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
am
talking
about
a
discriminatory
effect
in
view
of
this
test
having
first
been
imposed
in
the
wake
of
james
meredith's
attempt
to
enter
old
miss.
that
was
the
first
time
that
it
was
imposed,
and
it
is
clear
and
undisputed
that
it
was
imposed
initially
out
of
discriminatory
intent.
now
how
does
it
operate
today?
it
operates
today
by
virtue
of
the
different,
minimum
standards
of
the
traditionally
white
institutions
versus
the
traditionally
black
institutions,
to
channel
black
students
to
the
latter
institutions,
coupled
with...
and
this
is
what
the
state
of
mississippi
will
not
be
able
adequately
to
explain,
and
that
is
the
use,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
that
test
alone,
in
the
face
of
advice
to
the
contrary
from
the
act
program
itself,
which
says,
do
not
use
this
test
alone.
one
of
the
documents
in
the
record--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--of
course.
it
should,
presumably
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct,
there
is
a
lower
standard--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--at
the
remedy
stage,
that
is
certainly
one
realistic
possibility.
in
our--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--what
i
am
proposing
is
that
they
take
grades
and
other
aspects
of
that
student's
background
into
account.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely.
it
makes
no
sense...
now
they
are
saying,
well,
we
are
worried
about
grade
inflation
here
in
mississippi,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
it
falls
apart.
the
record
does
not
support
that.
at
page
18
of
our
brief
we
have
record
citations
that
show
that
act
studies
in
mississippi
show
that
students
are
better,
more
fairly,
more
accurately
evaluated
by
taking
something
rather
obvious
into
account:
high
school
grades.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
there
were.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
intent
at
this
time
in
using
this
test--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
am,
but
more
than
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
but
i
have
a
threshold
problem
with
what
the
district
court
did,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
district
court
got
it
wrong
in
terms
of
the
standard.
i
don't
have
to
survive
a
rule
52
challenge
because
what
the
district
court
said
was,
all
the
state
has
to
do
is
to
say,
we
adopt
race-neutral
admissions
and
other
operational
policies,
and
that
is
wrong.
judge
higgenbotham
got
it
right
in
his
dissent
when
he
said,
as
this
court
has
said,
that
standard
is
dismantlement.
you
must
dismantle--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
the
finding
can
stand,
but
the
finding,
nonetheless,
fails
to
take
into
account
the
standard.
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
aspect
that
may
be
dividing
us.
and
that
is,
if
the
standard,
the
legal
standard
the
court
is
applying
is,
is
there
an
intent
to
discriminate
and
there
is
a
finding
that
there
is
no
intention
to
discrimination,
then
i
am
not
here
to
challenge
that
particular
finding.
but
i
am
here
to
challenge
the
standard.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
was
such
a
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
am
also
challenging
again...
that
is
one
way
of
putting
it.
what
i
am
trying
to
submit
to
the
court
is
that
it
is
the
standard
the
court
applied,
which
was
not,
is
this
a
remnant
of
the
prior
system
which
is
having,
in
the
way
that
it's
being
used,
segregative
effect
and
it's
easy
to
eliminate
it
and
there
is
no
educational
justification
for
its
use
of
this
particular
test.
that
is
one
aspect
of
the...
our
standard
is
unfettered
choice.
that
is
the
key,
we
agree.
bazemore
sets
the
standard.
another
aspect
of--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
we
do
think
that
this
court
in
bazemore
said
that
where
there
is
not
state
compulsion,
the
state
make
the
choice
for
you
and
assigns
you
to
a
particular
school,
then
the
standard
is
voluntary
and
unfettered
choice.
that
is
to
say,
yes,
dismantlement...
the
two
are
not
in
conflict,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
the
state
had
in
fact
assigned
individuals
to
particular
4-h
clubs
on
grounds
of
race.
this
case
involves
a
variety
of
educational
services
that,
as
judge
higgenbotham
pointed
out,
when
we
look
to,
and
this
comes
to
your
point,
justice
o'connor,
when
we
look
at
two
aspects...
the
unnecessary
program
duplication
that
the
district
court
found
was
inefficient
and
wasteful.
and
there
are
two
institutions
in
the
impoverished
delta
of
mississippi
that
in
our
judgment
powerfully
shows
the
problem.
delta
state,
historically
white;
mississippi
valley,
historically
black.
the
facilities
are
quite
dissimilar.
the
library
at
one
is
twice
the
size
of
the
library
at
the
traditionally
black
institution.
the
problem
with
the
failure
to
dismantle
is
that
it
is
unrealistic
to
expect
persons
with
choice
to
choose
to
go
to
an
institution
that
has
continued
to
suffer
deprivations
of
funding
and
facilities
and
where
there
is
unnecessary
program
duplication--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
it's
inapplicable.
i
think
it's
just
the
standard--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
do
say
that,
exactly,
that
is
our
submission.
our
submission
is
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
it...
i
don't...
argue
with
the
court
about
the
applicability
of
its
own
precedent.
the
point
that
we
draw
from
bazemore
is
that
the
standard
is
whether
the
state
is
introducing
racial
factors
that
fetter
choice.
i
quite
agree
with
your
distinctions
of
the
4-h
situation
and
higher
education,
quite
right.
but
the
standard
is
that
of
voluntary
choice.
is
the
individual
able
to
choose
free
of
racial
factors
that
have
been
introduced
by
the
state?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
two
points
quickly,
70
percent
is
not
choice.
that
is
to
say,
given
the
admission
standards
of
old
miss
and
the
other
historically
white
institutions,
70
percent
of
black
students
do
not
qualify
for
automatic
admissions.
they
don't
have
that
choice
in
terms
of
automatic
admissions.
you'll
hear
from
mr.
goodman
through
the
brief
and
probably
through
what
he
is
going
to
say
about
all
the
affirmative
action
programs
and
so
forth.
dothard
v.
rawlinson,
we
think
is
the
complete
answer
to
that.
with
respect
to
program
duplication,
justice
scalia,
our
submission
is
not
that
there
should
be
a
perfection
of
duplication.
seven
states...
georgia,
south
carolina...
you
have
an
amicus
brief
from
tennessee,
has
shown
this
can
work.
how
can
it
work?
you
can
dismantle
that
old
system
by
putting
new
programs
at
the
traditionally...
the
historically
black
institution.
we
not
saying
that
there
has
to
be
any
particular
answer.
that
is
to
say,
what
the
state
should
do
is
identify
its
own
needs,
and
then
it
should
focus
on
how
the
historically
black
institutions
can
support
those
needs.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it...
that
may
not
at
old
miss,
but
we
are
trying
to
desegregate
an
entire
system
and
dismantle
the
entire
system.
let
me
give
you
a
specific
example.
the
president
of
jackson--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
don't
forget
my
act
argument.
you
give
me
my
act
point
and
i
will
have
many
more
qualified
blacks
ready
to
go
to
old
miss.
you
give
me
that.
so
that
is
one
answer
to
old
miss.
with
respect
to
building
up
the
black
institutions,
testimony
in
this
trial
showed
that
the
jackson...
the
president
of
jackson
state
said
to
the
board
of
trustees,
give
us
the
social
work
program.
that
most
fundamentally
fits
our
mission
here.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
change
of
mission.
we
have
been
designated
as
the
urban
institution,
give
us
that
program.
instead,
the
board
of
trustees
says,
thank
you
very
much,
we
are
sending
it
to
hattiesburg,
to
the
university
of
southern
mississippi.
what
the
department
of
education
has
done,
what
the
civil
rights
division
has
done
is
worked
with
states.
seven
states
have
fulfilled
the
plans
of
compliance
that
mr.
chambliss
was
speaking
to
in
u.s.
exhibit
1.
they
agreed
to
that.
they
fulfilled
their
obligations
under
that
plan,
and
they
have
come
out
from
under
that:
georgia,
south
carolina...
seven
states
have
fulfilled
their
obligations.
mississippi
has
chosen
to
say,
no,
all
we
have
to
do
is
raise
neutrality,
that
suffices
for
our
purposes,
and
that...
we
are
prepared
to
litigate
to
the
hilt.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
the
academic
standards.
in
fact,
the
core
curriculum
requirement
is
imposed
across
the
board.
our
objection
to
the
admissions
standards...
we
are
not
trying
to
intrude,
but
we
are
saying
that
you
can
effectively
eliminate
right
away...
you
can
do
what
all
the
other
states
do:
take
high
school
grades
into
account.
and
again,
the
inflation
of
grade
points
is
illegitimate.
the
act's
own
studies
in
mississippi
refuted
that.
that
is
just
wrong,
if
they
use
the
act
in
consultation
with
high
school
grades,
that
will
make
an
enormous
difference
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
this
system
and
of
dismantlement.
our
submission
is
this:
there
must
be
a
dismantlement.
it
is
undisputed
that
there
was
a
dual
system.
it
was
de
jure,
and
as
judge
higgenbotham
so
eloquently
put
it
in
his
dissent,
history,
the
history
of
state
action
has
worn
deep
traces
in
the
face
of
higher
education
in
mississippi.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
justice
white--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--exactly
right.
that's
our
submission.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
are
two
very
quick
ones.
i
think
that
our
act
argument
is
unanswerable.
with
respect
to
program
duplication,
it
has
historically
been
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
one
of
the
telltale
signs
of
a
de
jure
system
that
hasn't
been
dismantled
is
unnecessary
program
duplication.
and
it
abounds
in
this
system
and
the
district
court
said,
it's
wasteful,
it's
inefficient,
it
makes
no
sense,
but
it's
not
for
me
to
tell
mississippi
that
it
can't
do
it.
why
did
the
district
court
come
to
that
decision?
it
came
to
it
because
it
applied
the
wrong
standard.
it
said
all
that
we
have
to
look
to,
justice
white,
is
race
neutrality.
we
don't
need
to
ask
the
question,
has
the
state
of
mississippi
dismantled.
has
it
eliminated
those
fetters
to
choice?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
a
racially
identifiable
institution.
there
may
be
other
indicia
of
state
action
that
is
fettering
choice,
including
xxx
funding--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
have
no
quarrel.
i
thank
the
court.
