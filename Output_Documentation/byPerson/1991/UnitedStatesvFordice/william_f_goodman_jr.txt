mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
feel
like
we
come
with
a
little
extra
baggage
because
of
our
past.
but
we
don't
come
that
way
today.
we
recognize
that
one
of
the
reasons
you
granted
a
writ
is
that
at
one
point
in
history
mississippi
created
public
colleges
for
whites
and
separate
public
colleges
for
blacks.
and
you
granted
a
writ
to
review
whether
today...
today,
there
having
been
years
of
affirmative
efforts
to
overcome
the
past,
you
granted
a
writ
to
decide
whether
today
more
than
real
freedom
of
choice
is
required.
when
i
listen
to
my
friends,
i
wonder
if
they
recall
that
there
has
been
a
trial
in
this
case.
there
has
been
a
full
trial
which
dealt
with
mississippi's
good
faith
affirmative
efforts
in
higher
education
for
some
two
decades.
and
there's
been
a
careful
review
by
an
en
banc
court
of
appeals.
i've
got
a
lot
to
try
to
cover.
i
would
like
to
cover
first
the
contention
that
choice
is
not
enough.
i
would
like
to,
second,
speak
to
what
is
the
legal
standard,
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
not.
and
i
hope
i
have
time,
thirdly,
to
respond
to
the
petitioners'
attempt
here
to
argue
factual
questions
for
the
third
time,
factual
questions
that
have
been
resolved
against
them
right
in
the
teeth
of
findings
below,
and
that
is
the
issues
that
they
continue
to
raise
about
admission
standards
and
university
program
offerings.
but
first,
what
is
the
case
about?
you
would
expect
a
case
like
this
to
turn
on
whether
qualified
black
students
can
today
freely
choose
from
among
the
respective
universities,
whether
they
are
large
or
small,
whether
they
are
urban
or
rural.
and
so
it
should
turn
on
there.
but
happily,
access
to
higher
education
in
mississippi
is
an
accomplished
fact.
and
it
has
been
for
a
long
time.
over
one-third
of
the
black
university
students
are
in
the
five
predominantly
white
institutions.
mississippi
university
for
women,
with
the
highest
of
our
woefully
low
admissions
standards,
is
19
percent
black.
the
university
of
southern
mississippi,
14
percent
black.
mississippi
state
university,
13
percent
black.
the
university
of
mississippi,
9
percent
black.
thousands
of
blacks
have
attended
delta
state,
which
petitioners
emphasize
is
fairly
close
to
mississippi
valley
state
university.
delta
state
university
is
23
percent
black.
there
are
as
many
black
students
in
the
five--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--they're
current
and
they're
almost
the
same.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
they're
awfully
close
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i'm
sure
there
is,
your
honor.
that
don't
sound
right
to
me.
i
thought
the
lowest
was
7.
i
could
be
wrong
about
that.
today's
is
9.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
we'll
verify
them
however
we
need
to.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
record
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial
there
was
as
many
black
students
in
the
five
predominantly
white
schools
as
there
are
in
alcorn
state
university
and
mississippi
state
university
combined.
the
record
shows
that
approximately
one-third
of
the
black
students
that
are
in
4-year
institutions
are
in
what's
called
a
predominantly
white
institution.
another
approximate
third
is
in
jackson
state
university.
and
the
final
third
is
in
alcorn,
or
in
alcorn
and
mississippi
valley.
but
choice
is
no
longer
the
bottom
line
issue.
let's
be
candid.
the
debate
here
today
centers
not
on
choice,
but
on
the
three
predominantly
black
universities.
there
is
and
there
has
been
substantial
black
presence
in
the
predominantly
white
institutions.
the
debate
is
whether
any
institution
can
claim
a
constitutional
right
to
be
a
certain
size
or
to
offer
certain
programs
or
to
be
the
flagship.
now
the
united
states
said
in
its
opening
brief
that
it's
students
and
not
colleges
who
have
equal...
entitlement
to
equal
protection.
and
i'm
not
clear
right
this
minute
whether
the
government
has
changed
its
position
on
that
point
or
not.
we
are
not
disputing
the
existence
of
excellent
cultural
and
societal
reasons
for
preservation
of
the
black
college.
there
are.
we
are
not
discounting
mississippi's
commitment
to
the
enhancement
of
its
predominantly
black
institutions.
the
commitment
is
on
the
record.
and
this
is
right
from
the
record.
jackson
state
university
has
received
mission
enhancement
for
the
past
25
years.
the
united
states
expert
went
so
far
as
to
put
jackson
state
in
the
forefront
of
predominantly
black
institutions
in
this
country.
jackson
state
is
far
better
resourced
than
delta
state
or
mississippi
university
for
women.
alcorn
state
is
better
resourced
than
mississippi
university
for
women.
the
united
states
expert
testified
straight
out
that
the
three
predominantly
black
institutions
have
received
equitable
facilities
funding
for
30
years.
all
funding
is
based
on
genuine
educational
criteria,
except
for
one
fact.
the
schools
that
are
underfunded,
the
schools
that
are
treated
the
least
favorably,
financially,
according
to
their
mission,
are
the
three
comprehensive
predominantly
white
institutions,
but
which
incidentally,
collectively,
are
12
percent
black.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
that's
a
good
question,
sir.
and
that's
what
we
hear.
the
candid
fact
is
that
all
of
our
institutions
are
underfunded
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
receive--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--when
i
think
that
all
of
our
institutions
are
underfunded
because
they
don't
get
enough
to
do
the
job
we
would
like
for
them
to
do,
the
ones
most
underfunded
are
the
three
predominantly
white--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--insufficient
money
in
the
eyes
of
educators
to
adequately
do
the
best
job
with
the
programs
you
have
for
the
students.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
our
petitioner
is
saying
that
disproportionate
amounts
of
money
should
follow
black
students.
if
so,
a
large
part
of
that
money
should
be
directed
to
the
five
predominantly
white
institutions
because
there
are
many
blacks
enrolled
there.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
in
the
first
place--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--in
the
first
place,
the
fact
that
an
institution
is
smaller
and
receives
less
money
does
not
mean
that
it
is
not
an
adequate
institution.
a
lot
of
us
went
to
colleges
that
were
very
small
and
did
not
think
that
we
got
an
inadequate
education.
the
whole
concept
of
higher
education
is
built
on
diversity.
larger
schools,
smaller
schools,
rural
schools,
urban
schools.
and
the
attempt
that's
coming
now
in
this
lawsuit
is
an
attempt
to
somehow
say
that
every
institution
is
entitled
to
be
a
certain
size
or
to
have
a
certain
number
of
facilities
or
a
certain
number
of
programs.
and
we
dispute
that.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
i
can...
that
i
quite
follow
that,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
in
today's
world,
no,
because
we
have
absolute,
genuine
freedom
of
choice.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no,
sir.
that's
not
my
argument.
but
today
we
have
freedom
of
choice
and
we've
had
that
finding.
and
we've
had
it
for
almost
20
years.
what
the
issue
boils
down
to--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--no,
and
not
in
the
slightest.
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
came
up
here
to
try
to
say,
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
the
question,
is
that
good
lawyers
who
appeal
cases
often
like
to
say
for
you
what
your
position
is.
and
these
gentlemen
say
that
that
is
our
position.
and
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
do
defend
what
the
court
of
appeals...
i
don't
think
that's
fairly
stated
as
being
the
sole
rationale
for
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
if
i
can
explain
that
because
i
think
that's
why
we
are
here.
in
the
first
place,
factually,
mississippi
has
never
hidden
her
open
access
light
under
a
bushel.
what
this
trial
was
about
was
the
affirmative
efforts
that
went
along
with
the
process
of
doing
away
with
discriminatory
practices,
discontinuing
those
and
adopting
and
implementing
new
ones.
so
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
anybody
who
contends
that
all
we
did,
and
that
we
say
that
all
in
the
world
we
had
to
do,
was
wake
up
one
day
and
announce
that
we
have
new
policies.
anyone
who
says
that,
candidly,
has
not
read
this
record
and
is,
in
effect,
challenging
the
integrity
of
the
district
court
and,
indeed,
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals,
because
that's
what
we
had
a
trial
about.
what
we
did...
let's
talk
about
duty
because
that's
what,
perhaps,
the
case
is
about.
by
what
standard
is
mississippi's
conduct
to
be
judged?
certainly
the
standard
can't
be
dependent
upon
a
certain
statistical
racial
balance
at
institutions
within
the
system.
and
i
believe
both
of
the
petitioners
concede
that,
although
they
open
their
reply
briefs
with
a
statistical
predicate.
the
standard
cannot
be
to
put
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
control
student
choice.
surely
the
state
is
not
obliged
to
compel
students
to
go
to
college
one
place
or
another.
surely
the
state
is
not
required
to
go
to
the
outer
limit
of
having
to
exhaust
every
alternative
to
maximize
integration,
including
restructuring
the
higher
education
system
today
because
of
discrimination
20
or
25
years
ago.
here's
what
i
think
the
duty
is.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
know
exactly
why.
and
the
record
is
filled
with
testimony
on
that.
the
standard
that
exists
today
came
about
in
1976.
it
didn't
come
about
in
1962.
it
came
about
in
1976.
yes,
we
had
an
act
in
1962.
if
there's
something
wrong
with
having
one
today--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--we
do.
and
i'll--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--the
purpose
of
that
is
that
in
1976
it
was
felt
that
to
raise
the
standard
at
those
particular
universities
any
higher
would,
in
effect,
perhaps
put
them
out
of
business.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no,
sir,
they
were
already
at
a
15,
and
they
were
kept
at
a
15.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
in
1976,
when
the
school
officials
took
a
hard
look
at
the
admissions
standards,
there
then
existed
some
for
the
comprehensive
universities.
but
what
they
found
was
that
under
all
sorts
of
unenforced
exception
policies
there
were
people
in
those
schools
who
had
made
2's,
3's,
4's,
5's
on
act
tests,
and
it
was
felt
that
this
should
be
a
system
that
would
somehow
operate
to
have
people
going
to
college
who
were
to
some
degree
ready
for
a
college
education.
now,
please
understand,
it's
almost
embarrassing
to
talk
about
our
admission
standards
because
they're
so
low.
the
15
is
barely
reading
at
a
college
level,
but
every
institution
permits
exceptions
down
to
a
9--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--which
is
barely
reading
at
a
junior
high
school
level.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
the
united
states
expert
declined
at
trial
to
suggest
a
policy.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i've
heard
what
he
said.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
he
says...
he
says
the
state
should
use
grades.
if
he
means
by
that
that
an
applicant
should
make
a
certain
score
on
a
test
and
achieve
a
certain
grade
point
average
in
high
school,
then
he
wants
to...
and
up
the
standards...
and
by
the
way
they
should
be
upped.
but
we
do
use
grades,
you
see.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
he
is
criticizing
what
we
have.
i'm
not
sure
that
he
is
proposing
an
alternative
standard.
but
he
didn't
do
that
at
trial,
and
i
don't
think
he's
doing
it
here
now.
he's
simply--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
is...
it
is
unbecoming
of
the
united
states
government
to
stand
up
here
and--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--i
don't
think
any.
i
don't
think
any.
what
the
state
is
doing
is
defending
the
practice
that
it
had
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
defended
it
at
trial,
and
defended
it
into
the
court
of
appeals,
and
defends
it
here.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
to
maximize
integration.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
it
is
to
disestablish
segregation
imposed
by
law.
it
is
to
discontinue
prior
discriminatory
practices.
it
is
to
adopt
wholly
racial-neutral
admissions
policies.
it
is
to
make
whatever
opportunities
the
state
affords
equally
available
to
all.
there
is
to
be
no
racial
exclusion
of
individuals.
there
must
be
freedom
to
choose,
and
all
of
this
must
be
done
genuinely
and
in
good
faith.
now--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
i
was
going
to
try
to
address
that
right
now.
thank
you,
sir.
in
my
view,
with
due
deference,
it
is
pure
semantics
to
suggest
that
the
words
"positive
steps",
or
"affirmative
steps",
or
"overcoming
effects",
or
any
of
those
words
mean
more
or
require
more
of
the
state
than
what
i
just
said.
i
think
we're
saying
the
same
thing
by
using
different
words.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
in...
on
this
record...
on
this
record
we
proved
that
for
years
and
years,
and
altogether--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
bazemore
standard
is
all
that
we
have
to
meet.
if
indeed,
we
have
to
do
more
than
the
way
some
people
interpret
the
bazemore
standard,
we
did,
and
the
proof
is
there.
and
either
way
you
want
to
define
the
standard,
mississippi
has
met
the
standard.
do
vou--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--we
have
the
same
situation
here,
with
deference.
we
have
a
situation
where
at
one
time
there
were
all
white
and
all
black
clubs,
but
then
we
had
absolute,
genuine
freedom
of
choice,
and
so
the
continuing
racial
identifiability
was
not
deemed
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
prior
discriminatory
practices.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
we've
done
that.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
that's
where
i
simply
disagree,
because
i
think
we
are
engaged
to
some
degree,
with
deference,
in
a
semantical
exercise,
because
to
me,
when
you
really
analyze
it,
if
you
say,
not
hiding
your
light
under
a
bushel,
but
being
candid,
if
you
discontinue
what
you
used
to
do,
if
you
indeed
adopt
new
policies
and
practices,
and
if
you
indeed
implement
those,
and
if
everybody
knows
it
and
are
encouraged
to
participate,
then
to
me
that's
the
same
thing
as
saying
well,
you
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
do
something
about
the
past.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
precisely.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
well,
i
think
that...
that
whatever
was
required
for
4-h
clubs
to
genuinely
discontinue
the
past
and
implement
new
procedures
for
the
future
had
to
be
done,
and
here
what--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--well,
i'm
sorry,
because...
as
i
see
it,
and
maybe
i'm
being
entirely
too
simplistic,
as
i
see
it,
bazemore
of
course
is
an
answer
to
this
case,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
only
answer,
because
if
we
want
to
read
all
of
your
precedents...
and
we're
concerned
about
the
fact
that
we
do
have
a
duty,
and
no
question
about
that,
and
we
do
have
an
obligation.
the
point
is,
we've
undertaken,
and
whether
we
define
where
we
come
out
at
the
end,
in
bazemore
language,
or
whether
we
define
it...
define
it
in
other
language
such
as
affirmative
efforts,
we
reach
the
same
point.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
that's
a
good
question.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
we
certainly
were
at
the
time
of
trial.
we
certainly
were--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--after
the
new
policies,
the
affirmative
effort--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--by...
by
1980.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
mid-to-late
1970's.
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
in
a
nutshell,
the
duty
is
met
if
choice
is
there.
the
duty
is
directly
tied
to
the
degree
of
choice
individuals
enjoy.
i
think
when
you
read
carefully
what
the
united
states
says,
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
united
states
acknowledges
that
the
duty
to
disestablish
is
met
when
in
fact
prior
discrimination
ceases
and
nondiscriminatory
policies
are
in
place.
if
racial
identifiability
is
an
unlawful
effect
or
vestige
or
remnant,
then
the
schools
themselves
are
the
effect.
if
you
are
convinced...
and
i
don't
think
you
are...
that
the
predominantly
white
institutions
must
lose
their
racial
identity
to
be
legal,
then
the
same
is
true,
as
well,
for
the
predominantly
black
institutions
maintained
by
the
state.
what
i
did
not
get
to
cover,
but
it's
very
crucial,
and
i
don't
want
to
sit
down
without
being
sure
that
we
all
understand
it's
very
crucial:
that
the
crux
of
this
case
is
not
about
choice
at
all.
it's
not
about
the
careful
definition
of
duty.
the
crux
of
this
case
is
a
belief
by
the
petitioners
that
predominantly
black
institutions
are
entitled
to
be
enhanced
at
the
hands
of
the
state...
not
about
choice
at
all,
not
about
duty.
that's
the
crux
of
this
lawsuit.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
black
college
in
this
country
will
be
preserved.
it
will
be
preserved
by
alumni,
friends,
legislators,
private
support...
it
will
be
preserved
because
it
ought
to
be
preserved,
but
it
cannot
be
preserved
by
judicial
decree.
with
all
deference,
what
to
do
now
that
freedom
of
choice
is
a
fact,
what
to
do
now
about
further
enhancing
black...
predominantly
black
institutions,
if
the
state
can
afford
it
and
if
it
makes
educational
sense,
is
up
to
the...
candidly,
is
up
to
the
executive
branch
of
government,
and
the
legislative
branch
of
government,
and
is
none
of
your--
mr.
william
f.
goodman,
jr.
--i
would,
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
the
record
will
show
that
the
facilities
are
very
good
at
all
of
the
institutions.
i
thank
the
court.
