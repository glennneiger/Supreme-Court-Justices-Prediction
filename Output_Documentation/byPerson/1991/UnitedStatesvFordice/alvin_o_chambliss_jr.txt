mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
propose
to
address
historical
linkage...
configuration
title
vi
and
fourteenth
amendment.
in
1844,
the
state
chartered
the
university
of
mississippi
for
white
only.
this
began
a
long
line
of
practices
minimizing
the
participation
of
black
people
in
the
system
of
higher
education.
alcorn
state
university
was
established
23
years
later,
and
for
50
years
that
school
was
essentially
a
primary
and
secondary
school.
during
this
time,
from
1840
to
1940,
the
majority
population
of
state
of
mississippi
was
black.
thereafter,
the
state
established
four
other
white
schools
with
very
broad
scopes.
when
the
state
was
given
what
is
now
jackson
state
university,
its
initial
reaction
was
to
downgrade
that
college
to
a
high
school,
and
when
it
reappeared
again
several
years
later,
it,
too,
had
a
very
narrow
educational
offering.
the
state
freely
admits
in
1954
that
it
was
spending
less
money
for
its
black
institutions,
and
in
fact
was
sending
its
graduates
off
for
graduate
school
education
16
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
canada
case.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
seventies
and
the
eighties,
now,
when
the
state
claims
to
have
acted
positively,
the
state
action
reduced
black
undergraduate
enrollment
by
14
percent
and
caused
the
number
of
degrees
received
by
blacks
to
decrease
by
almost
400
from
back...
1990...
from
that
in
1981,
according
to...
government
published
report.
today,
the
college-going
and
degree-granting
rates
for
blacks
are
on
a
downward
trend,
and
this
is
due
to
discrimination.
this,
your
honor,
is
the
history
mississippi
wants
to
walk
away
from.
the
historical
discrimination
to
black...
hurt
black
people
in
five
different
ways.
equal
access...
they
were
shut
out.
it
segregated
them,
and
then
when
they
got
in
they
got
lesser
programs,
funding,
facilities,
reputation.
and
it
denied
black
people
leadership
opportunities
and
employment
opportunities
in
the
five
white
schools,
which
were
the
schools
of
choice,
so
to
speak.
but
now,
if
this
case
is
dismissed,
i
want
every...
i
don't
say...
if
it's
dismissed,
but
yet
we
show
clearly
in
seven
short
pages
in
our
reply
brief
that
black
people
still
are
experiencing
those
harms,
and
the
system
of...
rooted
in
the
days
of
apartheid
in
mississippi
still
exist.
nothing
has
changed.
you
have
the
misuse
of
the
act.
the
university
center
dominated
by
xxx
junior
college,
in
addition
to
three
white
schools,
still
stands
in
the
shadow
of
jackson
state
university.
you
have
black
people
still
feeling
hostility
at
the
university
of
mississippi,
and
basically
the
system
is
substantially
intact
from
1962
until
now;
99
percent
of
the
white
students
go
to
white
schools.
now,
the
en
banc
court
had
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
constitutional...
i
mean,
to
not
have
this
court
deal
with
the
constitutional
question.
it
relegated
our
title
vi
claim
to
a
footnote,
but
to
us
this
claim
came
first,
it's
independent,
and
i
think
it's
dispositive
on
this
record.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
title
vi
we
have
a
plan
of
compliance.
we
can
measure
promises
versus
performance.
for
an
example--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
title
vi
at
least
is
not
any
narrower.
i
think
that...
but
on
title
vi,
you
have
examples.
you
see,
courts
are
very
reluctant
to
get
into
areas
they
don't
know...
well,
forgive
me
for
that.
they
don't
want
to
get
into
areas
that...
we
must
say
higher
education
is
different,
and
we
think--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
so.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
i--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--yes.
well,
the
standard...
yes...
yes,
it
is,
and
i'll
tell
you
the
reason
why,
your
honor.
under
title
vi
you...
they...
they're
basically
three
aspects
that
i
think
that
this
court
could
look
at
that
would
help
the
court.
u.s.
exhibit
no.
1,
for
an
example,
the
first
exhibit
is
a
plan
of
compliance,
promises
versus
performance.
you
can
measure
what
the
state
basically
said
it
was
going
to
do
and
what
it
actually
did
do.
but
aside
from
that,
you
have
a
lot
of
interpretative
regulation.
you
have
the
revised
criteria.
now,
it's
not
law,
the
regulations,
which
two
co-equal
branches
of
government
expressed
their
views,
but
the
revised
criteria...
on
the
executive
branch,
but
the
revised
criteria
tells
you...
for
an
example,
it
says,
when
you
go
into
higher
education
you
want...
don't
want
to
put
the
burden
of
desegregation
on
the
black
colleges.
it
talks
in
terms
of
how
you
could
do
various
recruiting
mechanism
and
how
you
can
put
together
programs
to
overcome
the
prior
effects
of
racial
discrimination,
but
yes,
i
think
that
regulation
section
100-3(b)(6)(i),
your
honor,
is
very
instructive
in
this
case.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
i--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
just
say
it
like
this.
the
way
i
look
at
it,
the...
title
vi
is
an
independent
claim,
and
even
though
you
may
say
the
standards
are
the
same,
they're
not
coterminous
in
a
sense
that
under
title
vi
the
government
has
a
lot
of
regulation
that's
specific
and...
not
on
this
regulation
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
intent.
but
for
an
example,
if
you
look
at
the
guardian
case
you...
it
was
similar
to
the
regulation,
but
it
was
(b)(2),
and
of
course,
impact
versus
intent
standing...
the
constitution,
more
or
less,
intent.
but
we're
not
talking
here,
now,
about
impact
or
intent.
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
start
looking
at
title
vi
in
this
area,
for
example,
there
are
some
implications
in
terms
of
governors
and
advisory
committees.
now,
again,
back
in
the
old
days...
i'm
sorry
about
that,
but
back
in
the
earlier
days,
under
desegregation
law
they
used
to
have
advisory
biracial
committees,
but
in
higher
education
i'm
not
sure
that
would
work
that
way,
but
they
do
give
examples
of
how
you
can
pull
the
community
in.
so
i
guess
to
my
mind
it's
a
good
possibility
if
the
court
decides
the
title
vi
you
wouldn't
bog
the
court
down
in
a
lot
of
stuff.
and
you've
got
the
department
of
education
there
that
may
want
to
get
involved,
and...
the
louisiana
case,
which
was
different,
but
they
went
out
and
got
a
master,
and--
so
i'm
just
saying
i
think
that
it
would
help
lower
courts,
and
i
think
that
if
people
look
at
the
constitutional
standard
the
results
under
the
constitution
may...
in
the
long
run
i
think
the
results
are
the
same,
and
that
is
to
eliminate
the
vestiges
of
state-imposed
segregation,
but
i
think
that
the
means
may
be
a
little
different.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
no,
sir.
what
we
looking
for,
and
i
hope
i
answer
the
way
you
can--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--no...
no
sir.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
just...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
forgive
me.
i
didn't
want
to
be
rude.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
justice,
i
think
that's
a
good
question;
it's
a
very
fair
question,
but
i
think
we
have
an
adequate
answer.
you
see,
our
objective...
and
that's
why
title
vi
is
important.
our
objective
is
better,
more,
fair,
desegregated
education
through
a
fair
process.
now,
in
my
mind,
you
will
always
have
some
type
of
racial
identifiability
in
those
campuses.
of
course,
bazemore
said
that's
all
right.
we...
but
we
do
think
that
in
our
society
black
and
whites
ought
to
go
to
the
same
school.
you
ought
to
have...
you
should
not
have,
for
an
example,
all
of
the
administrator...
in
this
record,
for
an
example,
2
percent
of
the
white
faculty
is
black,
and
1
percent
of
the
administrators
are
black.
it's
one
black,
full-time
professor,
the
time
of
this
record
in
the
whole
system.
in
higher
education,
you
are
nothing
unless
you're
tenured
and
you're
a
professor
and
you
vote.
and
yet
the
few
people
there
can't.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
it
please
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
your
honor,
the
facilities
talk
about
as
the
grand
jury
condemned,
mississippi
valley
state
has
two
buildings...
and
it's
in
my
record...
that
just
stand...
look
so
good
from
the
highway.
when
brown
talked
about
stigmatization,
he...
they
talked
about...
if
you're
going
to
get
an
education,
you're
in
a
room
with
showers.
i
mean,
you've
got
shower...
hot...
you
don't
have
air
conditioning.
but
we're
not
getting
into
that.
somebody
here...
and
i
think
you
want
to
know
some
facts
about,
what
fetters
choice.
our
definition
of
fetters
is
a
factor
which
prevents
choice
or
promote
racial
choices.
now,
what
is
the
fetter
here?
(1)
we've
got
the
act.
those
are
finding,
intentional
discrimination.
we've
got
underwood
here,
hunter
v.
underwood
that
say
even
though
it...
well,
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
about
that.
we
have
the
staff
makeup,
and
the
programs'
disparities.
now,
when
you
talk
about
staff
makeup,
he
talks
about
30
percent
of
the
black
students,
but
he
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
98
percent
white
faculty.
he
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
1
percent
black
administrator.
he
don't
want
to
talk
about
apartheid,
because
you...
in
higher
education,
if
you
can't
vote
you
just
don't...
and
you've
got
to
be
tenured,
and
you've
got
to
be
full
professor.
staff
makeup,
the
racial
hostility
at
the
university
of
mississippi...
and
i
don't
want
to
dump...
because
i
love
mississippi.
i'm
from
mississippi,
and
i
graduated
from
the
school
there.
but
the
fact
is
that
there's
a
problem
at
the
university
of
mississippi,
and
it's
a
racial
problem.
and
i
had
to
give
to
you
all...
and
i'll
brief
the
facts,
but
the
judge
basically
was
laboring
under
a
misapplication
of
the
law.
and
he
found
facts
based
on
the
standard
that
was
sold
to
him
by
our
opponent
here.
and
that
was
basically
the
standard
is
you...
you
do
not...
you
implement...
well,
you
declare
on
paper
open
admission
policies
and
you
make...
you
know,
you
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
come
up
with
something
that
is
race
neutral.
now
what
that
does,
as
i
see
it,
is
not...
we're
not
talking
about
race
neutral.
what
you're
talking
about
under
brown
and
the
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with,
we...
we've
talked
about
the
"make
whole".
what
is
it?
louisiana
v.
united
states,
where
the
court
has
a
right
and
obligation,
a
duty
to
eradicate.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
thank
you.
