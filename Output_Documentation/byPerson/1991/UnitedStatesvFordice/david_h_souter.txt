well,
the
words
sound
like
the
rhetoric
of
the
bazemore
4-h
analysis,
and
i
guess
i
share
justice
scevens'
perplexity.
i
don't
understand,
as
you
explain
the
standard,
exactly
what
those
steps
beyond
bazemore
4-h
might
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
sir,
i
don't...
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
unduly,
but
before...
before
you
get
into
the
facts,
could
you
help
me
out
at
least
and
try
to
explain
in
what
respect
the
standard
that
you
have
just
enunciated
places
somehow
a
higher
or
a
different
obligation
on
you
from
what
the
bazemore
4-h
standard
would
apply,
and
then
tell
me
how
you've
done
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
difference
that...
and
i'm...
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
i
thought
the
crucial
difference
was
that
after
the
bazemore
policies
had
been
modified
there
wasn't
a
kind
of
administrative
structure
in
place
which,
by
continuing
to
reflect
the
old
policies,
encouraged
their
continuation.
a
4-h
club
is
not
structured
with
all
of
the
administrative
and
organizational
baggage
of
a
university.
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true
by
definition,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
i
don't...
that
doesn't
tell
me
anything.
