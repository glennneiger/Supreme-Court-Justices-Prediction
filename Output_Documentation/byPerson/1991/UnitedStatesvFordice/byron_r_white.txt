justice
byron
r.
white
you
want...
whatever
test
you
are
proposing,
you
would
want
to
apply
to
all
the
universities?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
there
is
a
lower
standard
to
get
into
the
so-called
black
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
higher
standard--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
you
would
lower
the
standards
for
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
propose?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
across
the
board,
at
all
universities?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
insisting
on
the
green
standard,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
just
to
dismantle
whatever
you
identify
as
the
vestiges
that
fetter
choice?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
whether
they
do
or
not?
you
don't
go
around
and
interview
people,
i
don't
suppose.
you
just
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
recognize...
you
could
just
recognize
that
kind
of
a
vestige
when
you
see
it
on
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if...
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
hadn't
identified
and
thought
that
it
was
proved,
these
two
vestiges
that
fetter
choice?
absent
those
and
yet
everything
was...
and
yet
there
were
black
colleges
and
white
colleges.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
mississippi
does
what
you
think
it
ought
to
do,
and
there
is
still
black
colleges
and
white
colleges--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know,
counsel,
what
the
purpose
of
having
this
particular
admission
policy
that
the
united
states
objects
to?
why
does
the
university
have
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
a
different
admission
policy
for
these
so-called
black
universities
than
for
the
other,
the
white
universities.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
purpose
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
raise
the
black
universities
any
higher?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
'76
you
did
the
raise
the
admissions
to
where
the
other
universities--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
how
long
had
they
had
the...
had
the
discriminatory
or
the
different...
different
admission
policies
been
in
existence?
justice
byron
r.
white
--let
me
put
another...
let
me
put
my
question
at
another
way.
why
does
the
university...
why
does
the
state
oppose
adopting
the
admissions
policy
that
the
united
states
suggests?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i...
you've
heard
in
this...
you've
heard
the
solicitor
general
say
that
you
should
have
a
different
admissions
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he's
urging
that,
and
why...
why...
why
does
the
state
oppose
that?
what
bad
result--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
do
you...
do
you...
why
don't
you
just
answer
my
question--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that...
why
do
you
oppose
adopting
the
admissions
standards
that...
that
general
starr
thinks
you
should
adopt?
you
understand
what
he's
saying,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
can
find
in
his
brief
the
suggestion
that...
for
a
specific
alteration
of
your
admissions
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
as
unbecoming
as
it
might
be,
why
does
the
state
oppose
that
particular
admissions
policy?
what
result
would
ensue
that
the
state
doesn't
want
to
ensue?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
to
you
that
the
facilities,
for
example,
at
these
so-called
black
colleges
were
nowhere
as
near
equal
to
the
facilities
at
the
so-called
white
universities?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
two
opinions
to
announce.
the
first
one
actually
deals
with
two
cases
90-1205,
united
states
against
fordice,
and
90-6588,
ayers
against
fordice.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justices
o'connor
and
thomas
have
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
