isn't
that
a
way
of
saying,
mr.
starr,
that
that
means
that
bazemore
is
inapplicable
to
this
context?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
said
that
bazemore
involved
4-h
clubs
which
are
very
easily
changed.
the
mississippi
university
system
involves
a
very
complex
pattern
of
entrenched
segregation,
with
segregated
faculties,
segregated
facilities,
unequal
facilities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it
seems
to
me
that
bazemore
is
not
of
much
help.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
the
installation
of
programs
at
those
schools
increase
the
black
enrollment
at
old
miss?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
we
are
right
back
to
justice
scalia's
problem.
you...
all
you
are
doing
is
saying
that
you
want
better
facilities
at
the
all
black
schools
and
that
will
tend
to
make
them
all
black.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
problem
with
the
academic
standards
for
matriculation
at
old
miss?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
going
to
tell
us
what
the
measure
of
your
duty
is.
it's
not
to
assign
by
race.
it's
not
to
use
every
last
means
to
cause--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
is...
and
then
that's
where
you
were
stopped.
what
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
o'connor
can
protect
her
own
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
answered
it.
the
proposition
was
that
in
this
case
we
have
racial
identifiability
caused
by
the
state,
and
what
we're
asking
is
whether
or
not
that
doesn't
imply
an
affirmative,
positive,
a
mandatory
duty
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
correct
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that...
but
that's
not
bazemore.
