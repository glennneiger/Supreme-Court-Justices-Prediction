may
i
just
ask
about
those
figures?
are
those
the
figures
shown
by
the
record
or
are
those
current
figures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
ones
in
the
record
don't
show
those
figures,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
had
a
figure,
the
latest
figure
for
the
university
of
mississippi
was
5.9
percent
black,
in
the
record.
is
there
a
later
figure
in
the
record
higher
than
5.9
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
are
we
going
to
verify
that
today's
figures,
to
be
sure
they're
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
criticize
your
opponent
for
trying
to
retry
the
case
and
now
you're
giving
us
facts
that
i
understand
are
not
part
of
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
your
position
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
page
26(a)
of
your...
that
you
satisfy
your
constitutional
obligation,
quote,
"by
discontinuing
prior
discriminatory
practices
and
adopting
and
implementing
good
faith,
race-neutral
policies
and
procedure.
"
but
there
is
no
affirmative
action
obligation.
that
last
is
my
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you
don't
defend
that
rationale
for
the
court
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it
were
the
sole
rationale,
would
you
agree
it's
unacceptable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
incerrupt
again
just
for
one
second?
is
there
any
obligation
in
your
view
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
take
affirmative
action
to
overcome
the
effects
of
prior
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
something
beyond
what
you've
described
up
to
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
what
point
in
time,
in
your
understanding
of
your
obligation
under
title
vi
and
also
under
the
constitution
were
you
in
complete
compliance
with
the
law?
at
what
date
would
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
like
the
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
trying
to
understand
the...
your
theory,
and
your
answer
will
help
me
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
give
me
a
date.
i
can
figure
out
from
the
date
you
give
me
what
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
earliest
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
date
on
which
you
believe
under
your
theory
of
the
case
you
became
in
compliance
with
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
