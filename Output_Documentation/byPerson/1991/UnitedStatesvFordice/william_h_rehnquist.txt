hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
90-1205,
united
states
against
ray
mabus,
no.

mr.
chambliss?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
good,
mr.
chambliss.
general
starr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
test
is
applied
to
everybody,
blacks
and
whites,
isn't
it,
general
starr?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
a
discriminatory
impact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
there
any
district
court
findings
on
these
issues,
general
starr?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
challenging
that
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it
is
clearly
erroneous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
asking
you
about
what
i
thought
was
a
factual
finding
of
the
district...
whether
this
particular
test
discriminates
or
was
intended
to
discriminate
at
the
present
time.
and
i
would
think
that
a
district
court
factual
finding
on
that
would
exist
independently
of
what
standard
it
applied
to
say
what
the
universities
had
to
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
there
was
such
a
finding
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
willing
to
leave
that
finding
as
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
are
challenging
what
consequences
flow
from
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
goodman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
record
show?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term
"underfunding",
"underfunded"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
just
used
the
term
in
argument
a
moment
ago.
i
want
to
know
what
you
meant
by
it
when
you
used
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
still
haven't
told
me
what
you
mean
by
the
word
"underfunded".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
kind
of...
not
being
underfunded
would
be
kind
of
an
educational
ideal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
follow
up
on
justice
thomas'
question.
is
it
your
position,
then,
that
if
the
state
of
mississippi
on
a
particular
day
in
the
1960's
says
from
now
on
there
are
no
racial
barriers
to
going
to
any
of
our
schools,
there's
a
uniform
admission
test,
we
are
presently
not
discriminating,
nothing
more
is
required
of
it
even
though
in
the
past
the...
there
were
historically
black
schools
by
law
and
by
custom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position,
then,
is
if
the
present
policy
of
the
state
satisfies
constitutional
requirements,
you
shouldn't
be
required
by
a
court
to
change
to
the
solicitor
general's
proposed
policy--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--even
though
it
might
not
have
any
educational
disadvantages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goodman.
mr.
chambliss,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chambliss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
