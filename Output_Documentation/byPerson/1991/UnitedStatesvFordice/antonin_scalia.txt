mr.
chambliss,
i'm
interested
in
what
specific
remedies
you
propose,
and
my
quandary
in
particular
is
this:
do
you
want
remedies
that
have
the
effect
of
providing
or
leading
to
de
facto
integration,
so
that
the
historically
black
universities
won't
be
overwhelmingly
black
and
the
historically
white
will
not
be
overwhelmingly
white?
is
that
what
you're
looking
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
mean,
if
you're
looking
for
that,
you
would
adopt
a
quite
different
remedy
than,
for
example,
strengthening
the
curriculums
in
the
historically
black
schools
from
the...
if
the
de
facto
segregation
that
now
exists
is
largely...
is
largely
the
result
of
personal
preference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
worst
thing
to
do
would
be
to
establish
a
black
university
that
is...
has
the
full
curriculum
and
is
fully
as
good
as
what
is
now
the
predominantly
white
university.
that
just
invites
the
society
to
segregate
itself
into
everyone...
the
blacks
going
to
one
and
the
whites
going
to
the
other.
now,
is
that
the
system
you
want,
or
do
you
want
us--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
want
us
to
destroy
that
system
and
adopt
policies
that
will--
justice
antonin
scalia
--tell
me...
tell
me
what
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
is
the
problem.
you
said
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
people
to
want
to
go
those
schools
that
are
under-funded,
and
i
would
say,
yes,
one
would
expect
them
then
to
go
to
the
better
schools,
to
old
miss
and
the
schools
that
have
better
funding.
so
that
is
what
is
such
a
puzzlement,
why
have
not
more
of
the
blacks
who
are
qualified
to
go
to
those
schools
chosen
to
there,
or
the
faculty?
once
there
has
been
this
finding
that
there
is
no
discrimination
against
faculty
or
students,
one
comes
perhaps
to
the
conclusion
that
much
of
this
is
a
question
of
personal
choice
and
personal
preference.
and
the
solution
that
you
propose,
namely
to
have
duplicative
offerings
in
various
schools
and
not
to
have
one
school
that
is
less
good
than
another
one,
will
produce
just
the
opposite
result
of
what
i
think
you're
after.
namely,
it
will
simply
reinforce
the
segregation
of
the
two
institutions.
justice

scalia
isn't
there
a
racial
identifiability
caused
by
the
state
in
bazemore?
