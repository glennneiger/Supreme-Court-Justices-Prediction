justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
the
court
should
resolve
the
title
vi
claim
before
it
gets
to
the
constitutional
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
test
under
title
vi
any
different
than
it
would
be
under
the
constitutional
claim,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
pursue
this
just--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--one
minute
with
you.
does
this
case
turn
basically
on
what
are
the
appropriate
remedies,
given
this
history?
does
it
turn
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
the
remedies
any
different
under
title
vi
than
they
would
be
under
the
constitutional
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
different
standard
employed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
starr,
let
me
ask
you
a
little
about
that.
why
is
it
you
limit
the
duty
of
the
state
to
only
removing
the
vestiges
of
discriminatory
state
action
that
fetters
student
choice,
if
in
fact,
the
state
has
caused
the
constitutional
violation
in
the
first
place?
why
doesn't
it
have
an
obligation
under
brown
to
eliminate
all
vestiges
of
discrimination
whether
or
not
it
affects
directly
student
choice?
for
instance,
funding
of
the
black
universities
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
bazemore
involve
a
situation
where
it
was
determined
that
the
state
had
caused
the
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--may
i
inquire?
if
the
evidence
established
that,
at
least
historically,
the
predominantly
black
universities
were
underfunded,
perhaps
not
today,
but
historically,
with
the
result
that
there
may
be
deficiencies
there
in
physical
plant
and
other
areas
that
still
remain
today
from
that
historical
underfunding,
and
if
the
facts
showed
that
that
was
caused
by
state
action,
do
you
think
the
remedy
then
has
to
address
itself
to
those
present
deficiencies
that
might
have
been
caused
by
prior
discriminatory
funding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
maybe
that's
what
our
cases
would
have
required
in
terms
of
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
goodman,
wasn't
bazemore
grounded
in
the
fact
that
the
segregation
in
those
clubs
was
not
actributable
to
the
state?
i
mean,
wasn't
that
fundamentally
what
was
going
on
in
that
case,
and
we
have
a
different
situation
here.
