chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
112
original,
wyoming
against
oklahoma.
mr.
leader,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leader,
what
would
be
the
perceived
advantages
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
commerce
clause
plaintiff
in
going
for
original
jurisdiction
rather
than
in
coming
up
through
either
the
state
or
federal
court
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
it
prove,
mr.
leader,
in
the
way
of
lost
revenue
because
of
the
existence
of
the
oklahoma
statutes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
severance
tax,
not
a
sales
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
wyoming
introduce
any
statistics
to
show
that
there
was
less
coal
removed
from
the
ground
as
a
result
of
oklahoma's
statute--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
leader.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
guthrie.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
go
into
the
question
of
standing
at
all,
ms.
guthrie?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
was
the
$500,000
a
year
proven,
ms.
guthrie?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
state
of
wyoming,
i
suppose,
on
that
issue
because
it's
the
plaintiff,
and
i
suppose
the
special
master
could
make
a
finding
that
wyoming
lost
a
certain
amount
of
money.
did
the
special
master
make
any
finding
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
make
any
finding
as
to
dollar
amount?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that
your
affidavit,
while
it
would
perhaps
support
a
finding
of
loss,
doesn't
rule
out
the
possibility
that
if
the
coal
production
in
wyoming
didn't
sell
in
oklahoma,
it
might
have
found
a
market
for
elsewhere.
the
affidavit
doesn't
say
that
wyoming
lost
tax
revenues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
indicate
that
that
same
coal
that
would
otherwise
have
been
sold
to
oklahoma
might
not
have
been
sold
elsewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
saying
that
that
is
not
a
reasonable
position,
but
it
doesn't
seem
it
is
the
only
one.
supposing
that
wyoming
in
1988
took
in
$5
million
in
severance
tax
revenues.
then
in
1989
it
also
takes
in
$5
million
in
severance
tax
revenues.
in
1989,
a
certain
amount
of
coal
that
was
previously
sold
to
oklahoma
isn't,
but
it
is
sold
in
utah
instead.
how
is
wyoming
the
loser?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
even
though...
your
theory
is
that
even
though
wyoming
did
not
lose
a
penny,
its
severance
tax
revenues
are
as
high
as
ever,
if
some
of
the
severance
taxes
were
imposed
on
coal
sold
in
utah
as
replacements
for
the
sale
that
wasn't
sold
in
oklahoma,
it
can
still
bring
this
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
questioning
the
special
master's
treatment
of
the
grand
river
dam
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
ms.
guthrie.
mr.
leader,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
112
original,
wyoming
against
oklahoma
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
