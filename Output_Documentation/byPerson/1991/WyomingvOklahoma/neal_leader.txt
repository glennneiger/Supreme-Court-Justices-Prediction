mr.
neal
leader
mr.
chief
justice,
and
maybe
it
please
the
court:
you
are
asked
today,
i
believe,
to
establish
a
dangerous
precedent,
not
a
dangerous
precedent
in
the
area
of
commerce
clause
law,
but
a
dangerous
precedent
in
the
area
of
your
original
jurisdiction,
for
today
in
this
original
action,
wyoming
makes
a
commerce
clause
challenge
to
an
oklahoma
law
that
requires
coal-burning
utilities
in
oklahoma
who
sell
to
oklahoma
consumers
to
burn
at
least
10
percent
coal.
this
challenge
is
brought,
however,
on
the
basis
of
an
indirect
taxing
interest,
an
interest
in
collecting
coal
severance
tax.
the
essence
of
wyoming's
claim
is
that
oklahoma's
law
results
in
the
private
wyoming
coal
producers
having
a
smaller
share
of
oklahoma's
coal
market.
this
reduction
in
market
share,
wyoming
argues,
and
i
will
argue
later,
but
it
does
not
prove,
reduces
wyoming
coal
production,
which
in
turn
lowers
severance
tax.
oklahoma's
position
is
that
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
commerce
clause
challenge
based
on
an
alleged
indirect
loss
of
tax
revenue
is
(1)
inappropriate,
(2)
not
necessary,
and
it
will
very
likely
popularize
a
new
trend
which
i
will
refer
to
as
end-running,
and
i
will
discuss
that
new
trend
in
a
moment.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
by
this
court
is
a
serious
intrusion
on
society's
interest
in
the
court's
most
deliberate
and
considerate
performance
of
its
paramount
role
as
a
supreme
federal
appellate
court,
and
original
jurisdiction
should
only
be
assumed
when
justified
by
the
strictest
necessity.
to
permit
a
state
to
maintain
a
commerce
clause
challenge
to
protect
an
indirect
tax
interest
is
not
strictly
necessary
and
not
appropriate
because
it
invites
mischief.
it
invites
a
new
game,
a
game
called
end-running,
where
someone
who
is
engaged
in
commerce
and
the
commerce
is
taxed
and
they
want
to
challenge
another
state's
statute,
but
they
don't
want
to
have
to
come
up
through
the
district
court
and
the
appeals
system,
end-runs
the
traditional
system
by
going
to
the
government
and
say,
you
taxed
this,
you
bring
an
original
action.
and
then
we
wind
up
with
an
appearance
of
state
qua
state
saying,
we
are
interested
in
our
taxes--
mr.
neal
leader
--i
am
not,
but--
mr.
neal
leader
--we
are
dealing
with
commerce,
your
honor,
and
almost
everything
that
moves
in
commerce
is
at
one
place
taxed,
one
place
or
another
taxed
by
the
state,
and
that
is
why
it
is
so
dangerous
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
neal
leader
i
am
saying
the
state
certainly
does
care,
but
i
am
stating
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
state
to
come
here
to
get
relief,
and
therefore,
original
jurisdiction
shouldn't
allow.
secondly,
i
am
saying
that
the
danger
is
that
we
have
the
appearance
of
state
qua
state,
but
we
really
have
a
state
qua
shill
for
the
local
industry.
mr.
neal
leader
having
a
final
answer
for
the
entire
country,
that...
don't
have
to
worry
about
being
overturned
so
simply
another
time.
secondly,
i
assume
it
is
proceeded
as
speedier,
if
you
get
here,
and
can
start
here,
you
become
the
court
or
the
forum
of
first
choice.
it
saves
time
and
money
because
you
don't
have
all
those
layers
of
litigation.
so
there
are
several
advantages
here
that
would
invite
the
danger.
mr.
neal
leader
that
will
be
my
second
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
leader
my
first
argument
is,
because
of
the
dangers
involved
here,
and
because
of
the
other
forums
that
are
available,
the
strictest
necessity
test
simply
is
not
met
in
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
neal
leader
you
may
control
them,
but
still
your
docket
gets
clogged
up.
mr.
neal
leader
even
that
takes
time
and
other
people
get
to--
mr.
neal
leader
--the
use
of
original
jurisdiction
is
not
necessary
here
because
first,
the
real
party's
interests,
the
wyoming
coal
producers,
have
both
federal
and
state
courts
available
to
them,
and
truly,
if
this
indirect
tax
interest
is
enough
to
justify
the
cost
of
litigation,
the
direct
impact
would
motivate
the
actual
movers
in
commerce
similarly.
secondly,
the
state
could
have
sued
the
state
utility
companies
here
in
either
state
or
federal
court
and
sought
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
judgment.
the
state
is
also
not
prohibited
from
encouraging
the
people
who
are
actually
affected
from
bringing
suit.
the
state
is
not
prohibited
from
helping
the
movers
in
commerce
from
bringing
the
action,
or
given
the
proper
appropriation,
not
prohibited
from
funding
it.
in
short,
there
are
sufficient
alternatives
to
have
this
issue
resolved,
and
the
strict
necessity
which
you
say
is,
was
to
guard
your
original
jurisdiction
has
not
been
met
here.
we
say
the
special
master
erred
in
finding
that
this
was
an
appropriate
case
for
original
jurisdiction.
secondly,
we
say
that
the
special
master
erred
in
finding
that
this
indirect
tax
interest
conferred
sufficient
standing.
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
that
recognizes
this
indirect
taxing
interest
as
justifying
standing.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
follow
the
teachings
of
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
in
philadelphia
v.
kleppe.
in
that
case
the
state
of
pennsylvania
sued
the
small
business
administration,
challenging
that
agency's
classification
of
a
hurricane-damaged
area
as
a
class
b
disaster.
pennsylvania
claimed
that
its
taxing
revenue
and
economy
were
damaged
by
the
mistake
in
classification.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
vicarious
injury
as
the
basis
of
standing,
saying,
impairment
of
state
tax
revenue
should
not,
in
general,
be
recognized
as
sufficient
injury
in
fact
to
support
state
standing.
and
the
court
goes
on
and
says,
we
need
a
direct
link
between
the
state
statute
and
the
collection
of
taxes,
and
then
says,
this
would
prevent
state
standing
in
cases
like
the
present
one
where
the
diminution
of
tax
receipts
is
largely
an
incidental
result
of
the
challenged
activity.
now,
even
if
on
occasion
this
indirect
taxing
collection
interest
could
justify
standing,
that
interest
has
not
been
shown
here.
as
this
court
noted
in
duke
power
company
v.
california
environmental
study
group,
to
show
standing
a
plaintiff
must
(1)
show
direct
and
palpable
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
and
a
fairly
traceable
causal
connection
between
the
claimed
injury
and
the
challenged
conduct.
here,
wyoming
has
failed
to
prove
those
elements.
and
certainly--
mr.
neal
leader
--what
it
proved
was,
is
that
a
share
of
the
market
has
been
denied
to
wyoming
producers.
it
introduced
no
evidence
that
demonstrated
that
the
loss
of
that
market
share
converted
automatically
into
less
production
in
wyoming.
mr.
neal
leader
this
is
a
severance
tax,
not
a
sales
tax.
it
is
tax
on
the
removal,
for
the
privilege
of
removing
it
from
the
ground,
whether
there
is
a
sale
or
not.
mr.
neal
leader
quite
the
contrary.
the
evidence
here,
your
honor,
shows
that
since
the
act
has
gone
into
effect
wyoming
has
produced
more
coal
and
it
continues
to
produce
more
coal
year
after
year
after
year.
in
fact,
the
second
year
after
this
act,
oklahoma's
act
went
into
effect,
there
was
more
coal
sold
in
oklahoma.
they
simply
have
not
shown
there
is
a
connection
between
this
lost
market
share
of
the
producers
and
their
severance
tax
collection.
they
offer
two
pieces
of
evidence
to
attempt
to
show
it.
one
is
an
affidavit
of
richard
markel,
who
is
the
director
of
the
wyoming
mining
tax
division.
his
affidavit
just
assumes
that
there
is
a
direct
one-to-one
relationship.
if
you
lose
a
sale
of
1
ton
of
coal
or
you
have
a
sale
of
oklahoma
coal
in
oklahoma,
that
is
an
automatic
loss
of
tax
revenue
and
he
just
multiplies.
but
he
is
assuming
what
has
never
been
proved.
the
second
piece
of
evidence--
mr.
neal
leader
--why
did
who
pass
the
statute?
mr.
neal
leader
they
assumed--
mr.
neal
leader
--sure.
they
passed
it
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
it
was
to
limit
the
utilities'
reliance
on
this
umbilical
cord,
this
railroad
that
connects
it
to
its
source
of
energy,
and
to
see
that
any
cutoff
in
that
energy
would
be--
mr.
neal
leader
--that's
right.
mr.
neal
leader
that's
right.
mr.
neal
leader
you
can
presume
that
wyoming
produces--
mr.
neal
leader
--they
have
lost
the
market
share
in
oklahoma,
and
what
you
can't
presume
is
that
that
loss
of
market
share
in
oklahoma
means
they
had
a
bad
year.
mr.
neal
leader
what
we
don't
know
is
what
their
production
is
like.
do
they
have
manpower
difficulties?
are
they
having
a
hard
time
meeting
their
present
demands
now?
are
they
selling
out
of
stockpile?
we
do
not
know
the
relationship
between
this
lost
market
share
and
what
is
produced
in
wyoming.
that
is
the
missing
link
here.
even
if...
let
me
talk
about
the
second
piece
of
evidence,
was
that
affidavit
from
mr.
cartwright
from
trident
oil
company.
his
affidavit
merely
says
that
he
has
a
contract
to
sell
coal
with
one
of
the
utilities
and
he
can
meet
that
contract.
he
doesn't
say
how
it
affects
his
total
production.
he
doesn't
say
how
he
meets
it,
to
say
if
he
is
meeting
it
out
of
stockpiles.
this
evidence
at
best
is
vague
and
suggestive
and
clearly
does
not
meet
the
standard
in
your
original
jurisdiction
cases.
you
require
the
plaintiff
to
show
their
case
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
there
is
no
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
this
case
showing
a
relationship
between
the
lost
market
share
in
oklahoma
and
the
ultimate
production
of
wyoming
coal
producers.
in
fact,
the
evidence
suggests
that
wyoming
coal
producers
keep
producing
more
and
more
coal.
now
as
to
oklahoma's
statute
itself,
oklahoma
freely
admits
that
its
statute
does
not,
in
the
constitutional
sense,
treat
all
evenhandedly,
and
that
in
fact,
that
it
does
aid
coal
production
in
oklahoma.
part
of
this
difference
is
based
upon
the
difference
in
the
properties
of
coal
in
each
state.
as
the
uncontradicted,
stipulated
facts
show,
oklahoma
coal
has
a
much
higher
btu.
it
takes
approximately
1-1/2
pounds
of
wyoming
coal
to
equal
the
burning
power,
the
btu
power
of
oklahoma
coal.
oklahoma
coal
has
a
high
sulfur
content
and
wyoming
has
a
low
sulfur
content.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
aid
utilities,
reduce
and
limit
its
reliance
on
this
coal
production
connected
by
a
single
railroad,
now
two
railroads,
and
to
see
that
if
there
is
a
shutoff
of
fuel,
they
have
some
protections
against
those
dangers
there.
mr.
neal
leader
sheer
economic
protectionism,
right.
mr.
neal
leader
your
honor,
i
think
we
determined
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
when
you
don't
have
legislative
history
for
the
act
by
looking
at
the
statute
and
its
effect.
clearly,
the
act
has
the
effect
that
you
talk
about.
it
also
has
the
effects
that
i
talk
about.
i
emphasize
the
effects
that
i
think
are
more
legitimate
and
i
emphasize
the
effects
that
i
think
are
least
legitimate,
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
all
those
were
intents
of
the
legislature.
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
area
where
the
state
has
in
the
past
been
given
a
great
deal
of
deference.
this
court
has
found
that
a
state
has
a
clear
and
substantial
governmental
interest
in
determining
the
need,
the
reliability,
cost,
and
other
related
matters
with
respect
to
utility.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
keep
the
lights
on.
society
has
a
great
need
for
that,
and
here--
mr.
neal
leader
--we
do
not
have
legislative
history.
mr.
neal
leader
we
don't
have
a
legislative
committee--
mr.
neal
leader
--in
the
utility
area,
the
state
franchises
utilities.
we
make
them
monopolies.
we
set
them
up
to
do
business
for
the
people's
good.
we
guarantee
them
a
fair
rate
of
return.
we
set
their
rates.
we
control
and
limit
many
of
their
business
decisions.
to
a
real...
in
a
real
sense,
the
state
and
utilities
are
partners
for
the
good
of
the
people.
and
i
maintain
that
in
this
area,
the
state
should
be
given
more
deference,
as
it
is
given
deference
when
the
state
is
a
market
participant.
we
are
not
quite
a
market
participant
here,
but
we
are
closer
to
that
than
a
mere
regulator.
and
i
ask
that
this
court
give
the
states
greater
deference
in
this
area.
now,
if
the
court
should
decide
not
to
give
greater
deference
to
us
in
this
area,
at
least
as
to
respect
of
the
state-owned
utility,
the
grand
river
dam
authority,
that
is
a
market
participant
and
your
market
participation
doctrine
protects
the
state
against
the
challenge.
there
is
a
severability
argument
here,
and
i
think
it
is
a
red
herring.
if
we
were
to
test
this
statute
clearly
and
only
as
to
the
grand
river
dam
authority,
it
would
be
constitutional.
it
could
be
applied.
we
are
dealing
with
an
application
of
a
statute,
not
a
severance
here.
it
is
clear
in
oklahoma,
and
we
use
oklahoma
law
to
determine
these
areas,
it
is
oklahoma's
statute...
and
a
familiar
rule
of
oklahoma
law
is
that
an
act
of
legislature,
while
invalid
and
inoperative
as
to
one
set
of
facts,
may
be
constitutional
and
valid
as
to
another
and
different
set
of
facts.
additionally,
oklahoma's
jurisprudence
provides
that
where
a
statute
on
its
face
is
applicable
to
several
classes
of
persons
or
cases,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
one
class
may
be
upheld
at
the
same
time
as
its
applicability
to
another
class
is
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional.
when
such
a
situation
arises,
the
statute
is
only
entirely
void
where
it
is
clear
that
the
legislature
intended
it
to
be.
we
don't
have
such
a
clear
intention
here.
the
oklahoma
legislature,
in
fact,
has
a
severability
clause
attached
to
this
act.
in
conclusion,
let
me
note
chief
justice
fuller's
comment
in
louisiana
v.
texas.
in
that
case,
in
commenting
on
original
jurisdiction,
chief
justice
fuller
said,
it
is
apparent
that
the
jurisdiction
is
of
so
delicate
and
a
grave
a
character
that
it
was
not
contemplated
that
it
would
be
exercised
save
when
the
necessity
was
absolute
and
the
matter
itself
properly
adjudicable.
i
urge
this
court
to
adhere
to
justice
fuller's
teachings
and
dismiss
this
original
action
because
it
is
not
necessary.
there
are
other
forms
available
to
have
this
issue
answered,
and
secondly,
because
it
is
not
a
justiciable
issue,
wyoming
having
failed
to
show
standing.
i
thank
the
court.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
neal
leader
your
honor,
i
will
waive
rebuttal.
