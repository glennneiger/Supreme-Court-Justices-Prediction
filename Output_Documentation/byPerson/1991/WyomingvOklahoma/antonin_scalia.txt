justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
we
come
off...
you
mean
whenever
a
state
has
a
valid
interest
and
a
sufficient
interest
to
confer
standing,
article
3
standing,
we
should
still
and
all
inquire
case
by
case
whether
somehow
that
interest
is
what?
significant
enough
to
justify
the
risk
of
end-running
that
you
refer
to?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
an
argument
that
there
is
no
state
interest
here
or
not
the
sufficiently
direct
interest
that
would
confer
standing,
but
that
is
not
the
argument
you
are
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
that
is
the
purpose,
as
opposed
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
right,
because
that
is
what
i
would
have
guessed
it
was,
if
you
didn't
tell
me.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
really
asking
for
something
more
specific.
you
are
not
relying
upon
some
legislative
history?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
title
of
it...
the
state
does
not
even
have
it?
i
mean,
the
state
does
not
keep
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
enlightened.
[laughter]
you
have--
not
only
that,
but
you
are
lucky.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
your
convenience.
how
come
you
are
not
the
coal
company?
i
mean,
why
didn't
the
coal
company
bring
this
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
explanation
for
that?
i
mean,
if
they
are
losing
money,
one
would
think
that
they
would
be
as
interested
in
it
as
you
are,
unless
you
have
100
percent
severance
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
didn't
think
we
had
decided
it,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
just
wanted
to
decide
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
guthrie,
i
have
a
problem.
i
guess
it
is
a
little...
it
is
even
more
fundamental.
you
have
been
asked
about
the
proof
of
the
damages.
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
it
could
be
proven
in
this
case
that
there
would
have
been
more
sales.
would
that
necessarily
establish
standing?
i
mean,
standing
requires
not
only
that
there
be
an
injury...
at
least
our
prudential
rules
require
both
an
injury
and
a
direct
injury.
i
mean,
i
think,
haven't
we
adopted
standing
rules
that
are
similar
to
the
rule
that
we
adopted
in
the
antitrust
field
in
illinois
brick,
which
prevents
a
secondary
injury
from
a
secondary
purchaser
whose
price
has
been
inflated
by
a
sherman
act
conspiracy
from
recovering
triple
damages?
isn't
it
the
same
thing
here?
i
have
never
heard
of
a
state
suing
for
loss
of
taxes
before.
i
mean,
what
is...
an
ordinary
contract
case
where
somebody
is
guilty
of
a
breach
of
contract,
an
enormous
amount
of
money,
a
great
big
contract,
do
you
think
the
state
could
sue
for
the
loss
of
sales
tax
revenue
from
that
breach
of
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
not
talking
about
a
sales
tax.
it
is
very
clear
that
had
this
contract
been
performed,
the
sale
would
have
occurred,
the
state
would
have
gotten
x
dollars
from
the
sale,
and
there
is
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
it
seems
to
me,
i
doubt
very
much
whether
the
state
would
have
any
cause
of
action
for
that,
as
a
person
harmed
by
that
breach
of
contract,
have
any
standing
to
complain
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
usually
leave
it
to
the
people
immediately
affected,
in
this
case,
the
coal
company,
and
you
said
these
statutes
could
be
passed
in
a
lot
of
states.
i
suppose
they
could,
but
i
don't
imagine
the
coal
companies
would
sit
idly
by
while
that
was
happening.
it's
not
as
though
we
wouldn't
have
an
opportunity
to
remedy
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
import
of
my
question
doesn't
go
to
whether
we
should
take
the
original
action
or
not,
it
goes
to
whether
we
should
think
there
is
standing
in
the
federal
courts
anywhere,
not
just
here,
so
i
agree
with
you
to
that
extent.
