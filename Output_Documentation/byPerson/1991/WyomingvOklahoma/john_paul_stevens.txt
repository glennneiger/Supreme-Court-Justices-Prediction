justice
john
paul
stevens
you
suggest
that
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
invite
the
state
to
impose
the
tax
just
so
it
can
run
this
end
run?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
suggest
this
with
respect
to
these
dangers,
the
parade
of
horrors,
let
me
say
something,
we
are
in
a
pretty
good
position
to
control
those
dangers.
in
other
words,
if
we
think
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
these
complaints
being
filed,
we
do
not
have
to
take
the...
allow
the
complaints
to
be
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
would
just
deny
a
leave
to
file
the
bill
of
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
doesn't
take
an
awful
lot
of
time.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
why
did
they
pass
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
oklahoma
legislature?
didn't
they
assume
that
it
would
cause
the
utilities
to
buy
oklahoma
coal
they
would
otherwise
buy
from
wyoming?
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
ahead--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
the
method
of
doing
that
was
to
increase
purchases
of
local
coal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
decrease
purchases
of
wyoming
coal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
can't
we
kind
of
presume
that
is
what
has
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
that
they
bought
oklahoma
coal,
that
that
would
be
coal
otherwise--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
they
would
have
sold
that
coal
to
oklahoma
had
oklahoma's
statute
not
required
the
purchase
of
the
oklahoma
coal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
argument,
because
how
should
the
question
be
decided,
then?
first
of
all,
let
me
ask
one
preliminary
question.
does
oklahoma
have
a
certification
statute,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
well,
i
was
puzzled
about
your
saying
you
couldn't
go
in
another
jurisdiction.
in
nevada
v.
hall,
california
had
to
go
to
nevada
or
vice
versa,
i
don't
remember
which
one
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
state
and
someone
else.
i
don't
know
why...
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
ruled...
if
we
followed
the
master's
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
invalidity
insofar
as
the
statute
applies
to
the
three
private
utilities,
what
can
you
lose
by
having
the
matter
go
to
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
waiving
your
severability
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
oklahoma
attorney
general
is
here
representing
to
us
that
as
a
matter
of
oklahoma
law,
this
is
the
result
that
was
appropriate
as
i
understand
him,
assuming
that
the
merits--
