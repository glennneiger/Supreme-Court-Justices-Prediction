ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
oklahoma
statute
which
the
state
of
wyoming
has
challenged
is
a
classic
example
of
economic
protectionism.
the
statute
is
discriminatory
because
it
has
disrupted
the
current
coal
market
by
forcing
oklahoma
utilities
to
purchase
oklahoma
coal
rather
than
the
wyoming
coal
that
they
were
purchasing
until
the
statute
was
passed.
we
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
special
master's
recommendation
that
you
find
the
oklahoma
statute
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
statute
is
invalid
because
it,
on
its
face,
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
it
forces
oklahoma
utilities
that
sell
power
to
oklahoma
consumers
to
buy
oklahoma
coal.
this
explicit
discrimination
is
the
most
blatant
kind
of
economic
protectionism
that
this
court
on
many
instances
has
invalidated.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
yes,
i
will
address
that
now,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
well,
i
don't
know--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--no,
we
don't.
our
severance
tax
is
8-1/2
percent.
the
assumption
would
be
that
perhaps
they
have
chosen
for
political
purposes
not
to
rock
the
boat.
perhaps
coal
companies
make
so
much
money
anyway
that
it
doesn't
matter;
however,
the
injury
that
the
state
of
wyoming
has
sustained
to
the
tune
of
at
least
$500,000
a
year
is
certainly
a
significant
interest
and
injury
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
there
was
an
affidavit
prepared
by
a
person
from
our
tax
division
who
looked
at
the
amount
of
coal
that
had
not
been
sold
in
oklahoma
and
estimated
how
much
that
would
be.
that
information
was
in
no
way
rebutted
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
yes.
he
referred
to
the
loss
of
severance
taxes
and
he
determined
that
there
were
those
direct
injuries
as
a
result
of
our
loss
of
severance
taxes
because
of
the
statute.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
i
don't
recall
if
he
did
or
not.
i
think
that
he
did
make
that
finding.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
the
affidavit
does
say
that
the
state
of
wyoming
lost
$500,000
in
tax
revenues
because
of
coal
that
had
not
been
sold
to
oklahoma
utilities.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
that
doesn't
really
affect
the
state
of
wyoming
sales.
the
question
that
you
really
have
to
look
at
is
the
injury
to
the
state
of
wyoming
as
a
result
of
lack
of
oklahoma
sales,
regardless
of
whether
wyoming
sold
coal
in
other
places.
it
has
lost
the
sale
to
the
oklahoma
producers,
oklahoma
utilities.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
we
have
a
stipulation
that
provides
that
until
about
1986
virtually
100
percent
of
all
the
coal
burned
in
oklahoma
came
from
wyoming,
and
since
that
time,
after
the
statute
has
been
passed,
the
amount
of
coal
that
has
been
sold
to
oklahoma
has
been
reduced.
there
was
a
report
that
was
prepared
by
two
economic
fuel
specialists
who
said
that
but
for
the
act,
the
state
of
wyoming's
coal
producers
would
have
still
continued
to
sell
virtually
100
percent
of
the
coal
to
oklahoma
plants.
so
there
are
facts
that
would
support
the
fact
that
this
statute
has
changed
the
way
that
electric
utilities
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
make
their
fuel
choices.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
our
position
is
that
because
the
act
was
passed,
we
can
fairly
trace
an
injury
to
the
collection
of
severance
taxes.
the
state
of
wyoming
has
a
great
deal
of
coal
capacity
that
is
not
sold
every
year.
so
we
have,
as
producers
and
then
as
tax
people,
have
experienced
an
injury
as
a
result
of
this
act.
it's
also
possible,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
other
states
could
then
begin
to
enact
these
kinds
of
acts
and
then
states
like
wyoming
would
really
begin
to
experience
a
tremendous
injury
as
a
result
of
this
kind
of
discriminatory
legislation.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
this
court
has
viewed
the
standing
issue,
this
is
the
third
time
the
court
has
viewed
the
standing
issue.
the
first
time
they
filed
a
motion...
they
filed
a
response
to
our
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
complaint,
and
the
court
ordered
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
answer--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--i
would
argue
that,
but
if
i
am
getting
questions
from
the
court,
i
wouldn't
be
so
abrupt
to
make
that
kind
of
argument,
but
the
standing
issue...
because
then
the
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
standing
was
denied.
then
the
whole
issue
was
brought
up
again
in
front
of
judge
tone,
who
had
been
selected
as
a
special
master,
and
he
also
made
a
determination
that
standing...
that
the
state
of
wyoming
did
have
standing
in
this
case
because
we
had
suffered
an
injury.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
well,
he
probably
thought
you
had
decided,
but
he
wanted
to
decide
it
again.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
yes.
he
did
an
awfully
good
job.
[laughter]
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
no,
the
state
couldn't
in
that
instance,
but
that
is
certainly
not
the
kind
of--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--case
that
is
presented
here,
because
we
are
directly
collecting
taxes
as
a
result
of
the
sale
of
coal.
the
cases
to
which
mr.
leader
refers
are
cases
that
are
this
injury
to
the
general
kind
of
taxing
power
of
a
state.
maybe
a
state
will
in
fact
have
to
assess
more
taxes
to
pay
for
some
kind
of
service
that
they
weren't
able
to
provide
before--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--well,
we
must
look
at
this,
though,
in
the
context
of
the
commerce
clause
and
also
the
fact
that
this
is
legislation
has
harmed
one
state
to
the
benefit
of
another
state's
residents.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
well,
you
referred
to
the
prudential
kind
of
limitations
that
the
court
has
undertaken
to
sift
out
the
cases
it
doesn't
want
to
hear,
and
you
certainly
have
developed
a
great
number
of
rules
that
deal
with
standing
of
original
actions.
and
i
would
say
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
requires
an
original
action
being
taken.
you
have
had
a
serious
claim.
we
certainly
are
challenging
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
violated
the
commerce
clause.
it's
not
a
trivial
matter
at
all.
there
is
this
direct
injury.
now,
the
state
of
oklahoma
says
it
is
not
direct,
but
they
have
certainly
never
shown
you
through
any
kind
of...
or
there
was
no
evidence
that
this
injury
that
we
suffered
was
not
direct.
it
is
just
his
saying
that
it's
not
direct
and
i
guess
it
is
my
saying
that
it
is
direct.
it
certainly
is
direct
so
far
as
the
state
of
wyoming
is
concerned
because
of
the
way
that
we
use
that
money
and
that
we
do
impose
that
tax.
but
there
are
several
different
prudential
rules
that
you
have
adopted,
and
i
would
suggest
that
virtually
all
of
the
qualities
that
you
say
you
look
for
in
an
original
action
are
similar
to
this
one.
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
this
court
accepted
original
jurisdiction
and
it
was
also
a
commerce
clause
challenge.
i
think
also
in
another
case,
pennsylvania
v.
west
virginia.
so
i
think
the
implication
of
the
commerce
clause
additionally
adds
another
feature
that
you
might
not
have
seen
in
some
of
the
other
cases
that--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--once
this
court
has
determined
that
the
state
of
wyoming
does
have
standing,
you
must
determine
that
the
statute
is
invalid
because
it's
invalid
on
its
face.
it's
also
invalid
in
its
purpose.
examination
of
a
resolution
that
was
passed
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
1985,
a
year
before
this
statute
was
passed,
will
show
you
the
kinds
of
things
that
were
motivating
legislators
from
oklahoma.
they
referred
to
the
fact
over
$300
million
had
gone
out
of
state
because
ratepayers
were
paying
for
wyoming
coal,
and
$9
million
had
been
assessed
in
wyoming
severance
taxes.
they
said
that
the
purpose
of
encouraging
utilities
to
use
oklahoma
coal
would
be
to
enhance
the
economy.
again,
the
classic
sort
of
example
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
this
court
has
disapproved
of
because
it
is
a
discriminatory
purpose.
there
was
only
one
purpose
for
this
statute
to
be
passed,
and
that
was
to
encourage
the
use
of
oklahoma
coal.
the
state
of
oklahoma
provided
no
evidence
in
this
proceeding
through
affidavits
or
even
in
the
statement
of
material
facts
to
the
special
master
that
would
in
any
way
show
that
there
was
any
kind
of
purpose
besides
some
kind
of
discriminatory
economic
purpose.
there
is
a
very
definite
protectionist
effect,
also,
of
the
law.
the
result
means
that
there
will
be
a
sale
of
less
coal
to
the
state
of
wyoming.
we
acquired
the
services
of
an
economist
who
came
up
with
several
different
ideas
about
why
oklahoma
coal
was
being
used,
and
the
whole
conclusion
that
they
all
reached
was
that
it
was
only
because
of
the
interference
of
the
statute.
the
state
of
wyoming
asks
this
court
to
declare
the
oklahoma
statute
unconstitutional
as
an
example
of
simple
economic
protectionism
and
to
apply
your
virtually
per
se
rule
of
invalidity
that
you
have
encountered
whenever
you
find
a
facially
discriminatory
statute.
we
also
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
does
accept
standing
in
this
case.
you
have
already,
as
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out,
you
have
already
looked
at
this
question
twice
or
three
times.
therefore,
we
request
that
you
do
affirm
the
special
master's
report.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
that
was
part
of
our...
we
took
the
exception
to
the
special
master's
report
and
it
was
not
so
much
the
treatment
of
the
grand
river
dam
authority,
it
was
his
holding
that
that
statute
could
be
severed.
we
feel
that
the
statute,
as
it
was
written,
really,
once
the
invalid
portions
are
removed,
could
not
be
validated.
the
statute
reads,
all
entities
that
sell
electrical
power
to
consumers
in
oklahoma
must
buy
oklahoma
coal.
once
you
get
rid
of
that
invalid
portion
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
statute.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
that's
the--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--that
was
true
as
well,
justice
white.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
that
was
the
argument
that
we
made.
the
idea
being
that
it's
really
not...
it's
a
demeaning
sort
of
thing
to
take
a
state,
one
state
into
another
state's
court.
so
from
that
aspect
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--bring
it
back
to
you.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
oklahoma
judges,
like
oklahoma
legislators,
are
elected,
and
perhaps
we
might
not
have
the
same
kind
of
impartiality
that
we
would
have
here.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
i
have
no
idea.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
but
there
were
some
kind
of
definite...
there
had
been
an
accident.
i
think
it
was
a
nevada
state
employee
who
was
injured
in
california.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
and
certainly
if
this
court
chooses
to
certify
the
case,
i
am
sure--
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
--certainly,
i
would
much
prefer
that
you
affirm
the
master's
holding
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
it
relates
to
the
three
private
utilities
and
not
worry
so
much
about
the
grda.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
i
am
not
waiving
it,
but
i
am
not
very
artfully
expressing
it,
i
guess.
it
is
obviously
not
as
big
a
concern
to
the
state
of
wyoming
as
these
other
questions
are,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
general
rule
of
severability,
you
would
find
that
the
special
master
did
not
precisely
apply
those
severability
principles.
ms.
mary
b.
guthrie
that
is
his
representation,
yes.
thank
you.
