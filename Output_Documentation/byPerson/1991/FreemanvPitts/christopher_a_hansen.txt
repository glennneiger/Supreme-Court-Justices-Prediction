mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
central
and
undisputed
features
to
this
case.
first,
the
dekalb
county
school
district
was
intentionally
segregated
on
the
basis
of
race
for
as
long
as
anyone
can
remember
and
up
to
at
least
10
years
after
the
decision
in
brown.
second,
the
district
court
found
it's
undisputed
that
the
dekalb
school
system
has
never
been
fully
desegregated,
that
there
remain
vestiges
of
segregation
even
15
years
after
the
court...
after
the
school
district
was
ordered
to
cure
the
problems,
and
30
years
after
brown.
and
third,
the
schools
in
dekalb
county
today
remain
both
separate
and
unequal.
one
set
of
schools
are
attended
by
black
students,
who
are
disproportionately
taught
by
black
teachers
who
are
disproportionately
administered
by
black
administrators,
and
those
set
of
schools
have
fewer
resources
than
the
schools
that
are
attended
by
white
students,
have
white
teachers,
white
administrators,
and
have
more
resources.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
district
court
found
in
looking
at
those
schools
that
are
disproportionately
black
versus
those
schools
that
are
disproportionately
white
that
you
consistently
find
that
less
money
is
spent
per
pupil
in
black
schools,
that
the
teachers
in
the
black
schools
have
less
experience
than
the
teachers
in
the
white
schools.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
district
court
suggested
that
was
one
element.
it
suggested
there
may
also
be
something
having
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
schools.
but
the
district
court
said
you
could
not
explain
inequality
through
just
those
factors.
it
said
some
of
the
disparity
could
be
explained
through
those
factors
but
not
all
of
them.
i
think
those
factors
can
in
part
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
there
are
black
schools
in
dekalb
county
and
white
schools.
one
of
the
consequences
of
continuing
to
have
black
schools
for
essentially
all
of
the
history
of
dekalb
county
is
that
sort
of
inevitably
leads
school
districts
toward
inequality.
it
inevitably
leads
to
black
schools
at
least
being
perceived
as
inferior,
and
in
this
instance,
being
treated
as
inferior
by
the
school
district.
last
term,
in
dowell,
this
court
said
that
there
were
two
questions
to
be
asked
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
first,
has
the
school
district
engaged
in
good
faith
compliance
to
the
prior
court
orders.
the
district
court
found
that
in
at
least
two
instances
that
the
school
board
has
not
engaged
in
good
faith
compliance.
they
were
ordered
in
1969
and
again
in
1976
to
desegregate
faculty
and
staff,
and
they
had
not
done
it
even
as
of
1986,
despite
the
repeated
orders
of
the
court.
today,
in
those
schools
that
are
80
percent
black,
the
administrators
are
60
percent
black.
in
those
schools
that
are
2
percent
black,
the
administrators
are
6
percent
black.
and
faculty
shows
similar
disparities.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
the
obligation
of
the
school
board
in
1969
was
to
break
the
pattern
of
segregation.
and
that
pattern
includes
the
coincidence
of
faculty
and
staff
segregation,
and
so
on,
going
along
together.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
don't
think
the
school
district
has
an
obligation
to
counteract
purely
demographic
changes,
and
that's
not
what
we're
suggesting.
if
faculty
and
staff
assignment
patterns
had
been
desegregated
in
1969,
if
inequality
had
been
desegregated
in
1969,
and
if
the
school
district
had
maintained
a
desegregated
school
system
for
some
period
of
time
in
the
1969
to
1973,
'74,
'75
period,
i
think
we'd
have
a
very
different
case.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
the
solicitor
general,
in
their
brief
suggests
3
years,
and
we
agree.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
phrase
that's
used
in
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuit
to
describe
this
phenomenon
is
one
swallow
does
make
a
spring.
hitting
desegregation
for
one
instance
doesn't
mean
you
counteract
50
or
100
years
of
segregation.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
thought
maybe
i
could,
though.
[laughter]
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
that
wasn't
as
eloquent
as
one
swallow,
which
is
not
my
phrase.
in
order
for
the
school
district
to
prevail
in
this
court,
it
must
win
on
both
of
its
propositions:
first,
that
the
green
factors
have
to
be
looked
at
as
totally
separate
entities,
and
second,
that
there's
no
causal
link
between
current
segregation.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
remedies
have
to
be
tailored
to
the
problem,
but
what
the
school
board's
argument
rests
on
is
the
notion
that
the
green
factors
don't
interact
in
any
way,
that
they're
separate
and
distinct
conditions.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
i
think
the
remedy
has
to
be
what
cures
the
pattern
of
segregation
that
has
built
up.
and
if
the
faculty
and
staff
assignments
have
interacted
to
create
a
pattern
of
segregation,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
can
involve
a
remedy
that
doesn't
break
that
pattern
in
all
the
areas
of
the
pattern.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
we
do
not
have
a
finding.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
district
court
ignored
the
possibility
that
the
green
factors
operated
in
interaction.
the
district
court
does
not
address
that
question
directly.
and
in
the
way
he
structures
his
opinion,
he
appears
to
be
oblivious
to
the
notion
that
they
might
interact
together.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
faculty...
if
a
school
district
assigns
disproportionately
faculty
to
one
particular
school,
that
says
something
to
the
community
about
what
that
school
is.
that
may
have
an
impact
on
the
student
assignment
patterns
that
grow
around
that...
that
school.
in
this
case
what
has
happened
is
every
single
one
of
these
factors
has
operated
in
lock
step.
every
time
there
is
a
school
that's
disproportionately
black
by
student
assignment,
it's
also
disproportionately
black
by
faculty
assignment,
in
some
cases,
anticipatorily.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
clear.
at
the
very
first
step
in
1969.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
it
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
the
district
court
in
its
finding
on
this
regard
is
somewhat
anomalous.
he
found
that
they
couldn't
have
done
anything
to
break
this...
the
pattern.
he
also
at
the
same
time
found
that
if
they
had
put
in
magnet
schools
or
grade
reorganization,
it
would
have
broken
the
pattern.
it's
hard
to
reconcile
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
your
honor
is
citing
with
his
findings
which
hint
the
other
way.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
upset
any
findings.
but
it's
also
hard
to
reconcile
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
school
district
did
nothing
with
the
district
court's
earlier
decision.
in
1976,
the
district
court
found
that
between
'69
and
'76,
in
the
area
of
student
assignment,
the
school
board
was
affirmatively
taking
actions
that
perpetuated
the
vestiges
of
student-assignment
segregation.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
they
were
making
it
worse.
they
weren't
trying
to
cure
it.
in
the
period
'69
to
'75,
the
district
court
found
in
'76
they
were
making
it
worse.
and
this
is
precisely
the
problem.
in
the
context
of
remedy
where
we've
got
a
finding
of
liability
here,
the
question
isn't
did
they
cause
it
after
1969.
the
question
is
did
they
cure
it.
this
court
has
held
innumerable
times
that
the
question
in
remedy
is
did
the
district
take
actions
that
had
the
effect
of
desegregating
the
schools.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
there
was
racial
imbalance
from
the
very
outset.
prior
to
1969,
the
black
students
were
assigned
to
six
all-black
schools.
after...
in
1969,
59
percent
of
the
black
students
were
assigned
to
seven
schools
that
were
disproportionately
black.
83
percent
of
the
black
students
in
1969
were
assigned
to
a
small
group
of
15
schools.
and
those
schools
had
disproportionately
black
faculty,
had
disproportionately
black
staff.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
that's
correct.
we
do
disagree
on
that.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
district
court
made
a
finding
on
that
question
but
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
finding
was
irrelevant
in
some
respects,
in
his
view,
because
you
couldn't
just
achieve
compliance
in
one
instant.
you
had
to
achieve
compliance
for
at
least
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no.
there...
the
clients...
we
have
consistently
argued
from
the
very
beginning
that
there
were
disproportionately
assigned
schools
even
in
1969.
the
court
does
quote
one,
i
think,
very
infelicitiously
phrased
sentence
from
the
plaintiffs'
trial
brief,
which
uses
the
term
desegregation.
i
think
that
was
intended
to
say
that
we
do
concede
that
in
1969
the
black
schools
themselves
were
closed.
but
we
do
think
that
in
1969
the
school
district
was
confining
black
children
to
certain
schools,
it
was
assigning
black
faculty
to
those
schools,
and
it
was
assigning
black
staff
to
those
schools.
and
then
we
rely
in
part
on
the
district
court's--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--there
was
certain
objection
to
the
plan
in
1969,
but
the
court
resolved
that
objection
in
the
very
first
year
in
the
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
there
was
an
argument
about
whether
the
final
black
school
would
be
closed,
and
there
was
a
debate
about
that
in
'69.
plaintiffs
did
not
raise
objections.
i
concede
plaintiffs
did
not
raise
objections
in
the
period
'69
to
'74
or
'75
when
the
motion
was
brought.
i
think
that
that's
in
part
explainable
by
the...
by
one
of
counsel
having
died.
but
it's
also
partly,
i
think,
irrelevant.
either
the
black
children
in
this
district
were
entitled
to
a
desegregation...
desegregated
education
or
they
were
not.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no.
i
think
you
would...
i
think
the
court
would
want
to
look
at
whether
the
faculty
misallocation
and
the
resource
misallocation
had
had
an
effect
on
student
assignment.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
in
the
context
of
a
school
district
that
has
never
been
intentionally
segregated.
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
we
were
talking
about
at
school
district
that
had
never
desegregated
ever
in
its
history
on
the
basis
of
student
assignment,
then
i
think
the
factors
can
operate
either
in
conjunction
or
separately.
if
the
question
is
are
we
going
to
remedy
a
school
district
that
has
intentionally
segregated
its
schools,
then,
i
think,
almost
presumptively,
or
almost
inescapably,
the
factors
have
to
be
all
remedied
and
the
factors
have
to
be
seen
together.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
don't
think
the
district
court
addressed
this
question.
i
don't
think
it
addressed
the
notion
that
there
was
a
presumption.
and
i
don't
think
it
addressed
the
interconnection.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
again,
we're...
this
is...
it's
an
anomalous
opinion
because
it
doesn't
say
precisely
that.
it
says
that
today
and
over
the
last
few
years
there
have
been
things
that
could
have
desegregated
student
assignment
further
that
the
district...
that
the
school
district
has
not
done.
and
it
then
reaches
magnet
schools
and
grade
reorganization,
both
of
which
the
district
court
says
could
have
had
a
desegregative
effect
in
the
past
if
they
had
been
used,
both
of
which
were
not
used
by
the
school
district
under,
what
i
understood
this
court's
precedence
to
be,
that's
almost...
that's
enough.
but
the
district
court
then
goes
on
to
somewhat
oddly
conclude
that
even
though
they
haven't
taken
all
the
steps
they
needed
to
desegregate,
even
in
student
assignment,
they
still
have
taken
all
the
steps
needed
to
desegregate.
i
find
his
conclusion
puzzling
in
light
of
his
own
finding.
i
also
find
his
conclusion
puzzling
in
light
of
the
district
court's
findings
in
1976
that
the
school
district
was
taking
actions,
affirmative
actions,
between
'69
and
'76
that
did
perpetuate
segregation
even
in
the
area
of
student
assignment.
and
it's
at
that
period
where
the
massive,
if
you
will,
resegregation
occurs
in
this
case.
in
1975,
just
a
few...
6
years
after
the
entry
of
this
order,
73
percent
of
all
the
black
students
were
in
12
majority
black
schools.
at
that
point,
this
was
as
segregated
a
school
system
as
it
can
get,
and
in
some
ways,
as
segregated
a
school
system
as
it
is
today.
it
was
in
that
short
period
in
the
early
seventies
when
the
resegregation
occurred.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
segregation
purely
as
a
result
of
demographics
is
not
against
the
law.
i
concede
that.
but
the
district
court
found
in
'76
that
the
student
assignment
segregation
in
this
district
was
not
purely
as
a
result
of
demographics.
now,
the
district
court
in
'86
appears
to
ignore
the...
its
own
'76
holding.
i
don't
know
how
to
explain
that,
but
it
does.
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
want
to
re-emphasize--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--i
think
this...
if
you
go
on
that
finding,
i
agree
with
the
court,
it
does
become
a
noncase.
but...
and
i
think
there
is
ample
in
this
record
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion.
but
i
also
think
that
the
question
in
remedy,
the
question
in
a
case
where
there's
intentional
segregation,
as
there
was
here,
is
whether--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
explicitly--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not
explicitly
do
so.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
however,
and
i
think
that
we
agree
and
that's
what
we're
proposing
here,
that
this
is
a
school
district
that
has
never
effectively
desegregated.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no,
i
don't
think
that.
yes,
mostly,
but
not
entirely.
i
think
that
if
the
district...
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed,
i
think
the
district
court
will
be
under
a
duty
to
break
the
pattern
of
segregation
that
exists
in
dekalb
county.
i
think
that
will
include
some
aspects
of
student
assignment.
now,
the
district
court
found--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--yes,
it
certainly
would
have
been.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
don't
think
anything
has
significantly
has
changed.
i
think--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--i
think
that's
a
reasonable
and
plausible
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion.
it's
not
the
one
i
would
adopt.
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
was
saying
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it's
clear
that
the
school
district
did
take
actions
that
segregated.
it's
also
even
more
clear
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
that
the
school
district
had
a
duty
to
desegregate
and
that
this
has
never
been
a
desegregated
school
district.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
you
have
to
look
at
the
green
factors
as
an
interconnected,
interrelated
pattern.
and
what
we
have
to
do
is
break
this
pattern.
and
i
think
this
court
of
appeals...
all
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
was
what
this
court
has
said
in
columbus
and
even
in
swann.
you
have
to
break
the
pattern
of
segregated
schools
in
such
a
way
that
the
black
children
of
this
county
receive
a
desegregated
education
for
some
period
of
time
in
their
lives.
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
that's
never
happened
here
and
was
relying
on,
i
think,
some
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
that
regard...
magnet
school
finding
and
the
grade
reorganization
finding
and
so
on.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
think
pasadena
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
can't
readjust...
can't
minutely
readjust
boundaries
year
after
year
after
year
after
year
indefinitely.
i
mean--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--that
is
not,
i
believe,
what
spangler
stands
for,
what
pasadena
stands
for.
i
think
spangler
and
the
pasadena
case
does
not
say
that
the
vestiges
can't
be
considered
interconnected.
it
doesn't
even
sort
of
directly
address
that
question.
the
only
apparent
vestige
that
appeared
to
remain
in
pasadena,
at
least
based
on
the
court's
opinion,
was
in
faculty
hiring.
faculty
hiring
is
in
fact
somewhat
different
than
faculty
assignment.
because
faculty
assignment
and
student
assignment
and
resource
assignment
and
staff
assignment
all
sort
of
go
together
to
give
you
a
segregated
school
system.
faculty
hiring
plays
less
a
role
in
giving
you
a
picture
or
a
reality
of
a
segregated
school.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
think
faculty
hiring
can
be
a
vestige,
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
cured.
i
think
that--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--it
had
not
been
cured.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
indefinitely
into
the
future,
that's
what
the
court
said.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
but
in
pasadena
itself,
thereafter,
the
district
court
was
involved
in
student
assignment
issues
and
in
faculty
assignment
issues.
the...
i
don't
think
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
in
that
case
interpreted
this
court's
opinion
to
say
that
student
assignment
was
forever...
inquiry
into
student
assignment
was
forever
barred,
because
i
think
that
inquiry
still
needed
to
be
made.
all
right,
is
there
a
pattern
here
and
has
this
pattern
been
broken.
and
i
think
that
it
hadn't
been
broken
in
pasadena.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
think
the...
if
the
school
board
has
contributed
in
part
to
the
current
segregation
in
student
assignment,
as
well
as
the
other
areas,
then
i
think
that
children
in
dekalb
county
are
entitled
to
a
fully
desegregated
education.
if
that
job
is
harder
today
than
it
was
in
1969
or
1970
because
of
demographic
changes
in
the
district,
that's
the
school
board's
own
fault.
they
could
have
desegregated
in
'69,
'70,
'71.
they
could
have
given
us
a
period
of
desegregated
education
in
that
period.
if
demographic
changes
occurred
since
then,
it's
not
the
children
who
should
bear
the
brunt
of
that.
it's
the
school
district.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
both.
the
precise
decree
that
was
entered
indicated
that
in
several
areas
they
had
to
take
specific
actions...
for
example,
construction.
the
order
said
construction
had
to
be
used
in
the
future
to
disestablish
the
segregated
system
rather
than
establish
it.
and
in
fact,
they
used
construction
exactly
the
opposite
way.
they
closed
schools
in
the
middle
of
the
district
that
would
have
been
naturally
desegregated
and
opened
schools
around
the
periphery
of
the
district.
but
i
also
think
that
in
addition
the
original
order
said
that
you
had...
couldn't
discriminate
against
black
children.
and
what
we
find
today
is
that
there
is
discrimination,
unequal
resources
being
provided
to
the
black
schools.
so
i
think
both
by
the
terms
of
the
decree
and
by
general
principles
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
think
the
duty
would
have
occurred
in
1969
and
the
early
seventies,
and
occurs...
remains
in
existence
today.
this
school
district
is
not
the
first
school
district
in
history
to
have
tried
to
take
the
various
parts
of
a
school
system
and
break
it
into
little
pieces
and
look
at
each
one
separately.
in
1965
in
rogers,
the
school
district
argued
in
this
court
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
desegregate
grade
by
grade,
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
in
keyes,
the
school
district
argued
that
it
should
be
able
to
segregate
geography
by
geography,
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
district
court,
this
school
district
argued
it
should
be
able
to
desegregate
school
by
school.
and
the
district
court
properly
described
that
notion
as
ridiculous.
their
argument
with
respect
to
the
green
factors
in
this
court
is
really
no
different
than
the
arguments
that
the
others
have
made
in
the
past
and
have
been
rejected
by
this
court.
and
that
is
that
the
condition
that
offends
the
constitution
is
not
a
segregated
school
system,
but
it's
little
pieces
of
segregation,
each
of
which
are
unrelated
and
not
connected.
in
our
view,
the...
in
keyes,
this
court
said
that
you
look
at
the
green
factors,
quote,
"considered
together",
unquote.
that
remains
our
view,
that
you
look
at
the
green
factors
considered
together
and
their
interaction.
and
what
is
striking
in
dekalb
county
is
that
the
green
factors
did
in
fact
go
along
together
throughout
the
entire
history
of
dekalb
county.
for
every
single
year,
if
a
school
was
black
by
student
assignment,
it
was
black
by
faculty
assignment
as
well.
it
was
black
by
staff
assignment
as
well.
and
at
least
for
the
last
few
years
it's
been
unequal
as
well.
and
for
every
single
year
of
this
school
district's
history,
if
a
school
was
white
by
student
assignment,
it
was
also
white
by
teacher
assignment,
it
was
also
white
by
staff
assignment,
and
it
got
more
resources.
in
our
view,
the
court
should
not...
should
affirm
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
shouldn't
reward
this
school
district
that
has
delayed
desegregating,
giving
the
black
children
of
this
county
a
fully
desegregated
education,
for
almost
20
years.
instead,
what
the
court
ought
to
do
is
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
and
allow
the
black
children
in
dekalb
county
to
finally
have
a
desegregated
education.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
you
can...
what
a
classic
neighborhood
school
plan
is
is
there
are
very
tight
little
neighborhood
schools
and
tight
little
boundaries
around
the
school.
if
you
take
four
or
five
neighborhood
schools
and
consider
that
your
sort
of
school
boundary,
then
you
can
assign
students.
you
see
that
as
one
school
boundary
and
you
can
assign
students
sort
of
as
a
group
within
that.
and
it
can
have
a
desegregative
effect.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
today
that's
true.
it's
not
clear
that
that
would
have
been
true
if
subdistricting
had
been
going
on
in
1969
or
'70
or
'71
or
'72.
dekalb...
southern
dekalb
county
is
disproportionately
black
today,
but
that
wasn't
true
in
the
early
years.
the
ultimate
irony
of
this
case
is
it
was
easy
to
desegregate
this
school
district
in
the
early
years,
but
the
school
district
didn't
do
that.
it
assigned...
it
continued
to
do
things
like
assign
black
faculty
and
black
staff
to
black
schools.
we'll
never
know--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--if
you
had
done
it
subdistrict
north,
central,
south,
that's
exactly
correct.
if
you'd
done
subdistrict
east,
middle,
west,
it's
not
correct
because
then
you
would
be
drawing
from
the
northern
black
schools
in
east
and...
the
northern
white
schools
in
the
east
and
the
southern
black
schools
in
the
east,
and
the
northern
white
schools
in
the
center.
i
mean,
you
can
divide
your
subdistrict
in
any
number
of
ways,
so
that
depending
upon
how
you
draw
your
subdistrict
lines
you
would
not
necessarily
have
the
result
that
your
honor
is
suggesting.
you
might
well
have
a
much
more
desegregated
school.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
both.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no.
and
we
don't
concede,
as
i
think
i've
suggested,
we
don't
concede
that
all
of
the
population...
student
assignment
population
today,
can
be
explained
purely
by
demographics.
but
the
demographic
features
go
both
ways.
there's
a
chart
particularly,
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
shows
how
there's
been
an
increase
in
the
number
of
black
people
in
dekalb
county.
only
in
the
1975
to
1980
period,
then
there
start
to
be
a
decline
in
white
people
in
dekalb
county
and
movement
into
surrounding
counties,
and
also
into
the
northern
part
of
the
county.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
that's
right.
it
wasn't
until
1975,
as
we
suggest,
that
this...
the
problems
that
the
school
district
is
suggesting
are
created
by
the
demographics
actually
started
to
occur.
and
of
course,
by
1975
we
already
had
73
percent
of
the
black
children
in
the
majority
black
schools.
and
by
the
time
the
whites
started
to
leave
the
county,
we
already
had
the
problem
that
they
now
complain
is
giving
them...
making
it
more
difficult
to
desegregate
today.
all
we
ask
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
be
affirmed
and
that
the
black
children
of
dekalb
county
one
day
have
a
desegregated
education.
