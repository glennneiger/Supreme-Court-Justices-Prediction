justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
found
for
a
time
there
was
a
racial
balance?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
that?
did
it
start--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
there's
no
question
that
there
was
racial
balance--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
soon
as
there
was
neighborhood
schools--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
what
if
it
was
unquestioned
that
the
faculty
had
been
appropriately
desegregated
and
that
resources
were
equal,
but
nevertheless,
there
was
this
student
imbalance
that
was...
that
had
been
going
on
for
years,
almost
immediately
after
the
decree
was
entered?
what
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
if
the
staff
and
the
resources
are
all...
have
all
been
solved,
and
you
think
the
school
board,
nevertheless,
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
reassign
students
to
counteract
the
demographic
changes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
the
school
board
would
have
been
required
to
reassign
students
to
counteract
demographic
changes
for
at
least
3
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
a
constitutional
duty
to
counteract
demographic
changes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
couldn't
answer
my
question
by
quoting
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you
had
to
do
is
say
yes.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
court--
--what
do
you
mean
by
interact?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the...
at
your
first
step,
the
school
board
has
no
responsibility
and
couldn't
possibly
have
prevented
these
demographic
changes
which
caused
the
student
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not
be
sure
of
it,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
upset
any
of
his
findings.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whatever
they
managed
to
do
really
didn't
cure
the
problem,
did
it?
of
student
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't...
i
gather
that
immediately
upon
the
entry
of
the
decree
and
as
soon
as
neighborhood
zones
were
created
and
the
black
schools
were
closed
that
there
was
not
this
racial
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
disagree
with
your
opponent
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
compliance
with
the
decree,
that
there
was...
that
there
was
not
an
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
we
go
on
that,
we...
this
becomes
almost
a
noncase,
if
you
go
on
that
finding
that
the
school
board
is
then
causing
imbalance
in
the
school
system
deliberately.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
go
on
that
thesis
that
you
just
proposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
decided
on
different
grounds,
and
those
are
the
grounds
we're
reviewing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
about
pasadena?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
are
some
other
vestiges
that
are
still
apparent?
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
is...
that
wasn't
even
a
vestige
then,
that
had
to
be
cured?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wasn't
cured
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
the
court
said
that
the
district
court
wasn't
required
and
shouldn't
have
tried
to
keep
up
with
demographic
changes.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
right
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
you
and
your
colleague
on
the
other
side,
about
whether
at
any
point
the
students
were...
the
student
attendance
problem
was
cured.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
opponent
quotes
some
figures
indicates
that's
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disturb
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
only
to
that
extent,
only
with
respect
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
don't
say
that
the
entire
decree
should
be
vacated.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
have...
you
still
have
a
problem
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you're
just
wanting
be
free
from
having
to
readjust
student
assignments.
