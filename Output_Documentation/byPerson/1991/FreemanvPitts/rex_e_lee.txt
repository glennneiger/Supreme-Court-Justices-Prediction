mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
two
questions
presented
by
this
case
are
squarely
and
cleanly
framed
by
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact.
since
1969,
the
dekalb
county
school
system
has
been
subject
to
a
federal
desegregation
order
formulated
principally
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
and
containing
two
core
features:
neighborhood
school
system
attendance
zones
and
the
immediate
and
complete
abolition
of
all
racially...
of
the
six
racially
identifiable
schools
that
existed
as
of
1969.
beginning
almost
immediately
after
the
entry
of
that
order,
dekalb
county,
which
borders
atlanta
immediately
on
the
east,
experienced
population
shifts
described
by
one
expert
as
one
of
the
most
largest
and
most
rapid
ever
observed
anywhere.
so
that
from
1970
through
1986,
the
percentage
of
black
students
served
by
this
school
district
increased
from
slightly
over
5
percent
to
almost
50
percent,
with
a
disproportionately
high
concentration
in
the
southern
part
of
the
county.
the
district
court
found,
in
response
to
petitioners'
request
to
be
relieved
of
further
judicial
relief
under
the
1969
order,
that
the
racial
imbalances
which
had
resulted
in
the
schools
were
"the
result
of
demographic
shifts"
which
could
again,
quote...
which
again,
quote,
"were
not
caused
by
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
dcss.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
until
such
time
as
this
racial...
as
this...
these
demographic
changes
came
in.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
almost
immediately.
it
started
and
has
just
continued
since
that
time,
and
it
continues
today.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
there
was
racial
balance
in
the
beginning.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
actually
this
was
a
very
clean
approach
that
hew
took.
that
was
really
all
that
was
needed.
unlike
most
of
the
southern
districts,
dekalb
was
able
to
just
eliminate
those
six
black
schools,
which
had
always
been
the
principal
problem,
and
then
that
with
the
neighborhood
school
zones.
but
the
subsequent
racial
imbalance
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
demographics.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
and
i
think
to
leave
it
in
place
for
a
time
to
see
what
it
was
that
might
happen.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
order
as
of
1969.
the
court,
in
fact,
determined
that
for
a
time
there
was
what
you
would
under
any
circumstance
desegregation.
but
then
later
on,
there
were
these
demographic
shifts,
over
which
the
district
court
said
we
had
no
control,
that
changed
the
racial
mix.
but
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--almost,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
i
read
his
order,
that
is
simply
not
consistent
with
any
of
the
findings
that
he
made.
what
he
said
was
in
essence--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
it
happens
that
he
did
not
make
that
specific
finding.
but
what
he
did
say
was
that
regardless
of
whether
the
school
district
had
taken
the
steps
that
years
down
the
road
the
respondent
said
he
should
have
taken,
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
in
as
far
as
the
racial
mix
in
the
schools
was
concerned.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that
really
wasn't
this
case.
because
in
this
case
we
were
in
balance
within
a
short
period
of
time
after
the
entry
of
the
order.
but
the
question
that
you're
asking,
which
is
a
hypothetical
in
this
case,
is
a
much
more
difficult
one.
and
i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
the
findings
of
fact
happened
to
be
in
that
particular
instance.
but
i
think...
in
the
majority
of
instances,
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes,
there
probably
would
be
a
period
of
time
in
which
it
would
continue.
but
the
point
is
that
here,
under
those
circumstances,
the
order
has
existed
for
22
years.
and
the
district
court,
consistent
with
these
findings
that
it
made,
retained
jurisdiction
over
two
issues
which
are
not
before
the
court
today,
namely,
faculty
assignment
and
allocation
of
resources.
but
it
held
that
it
would
order
no
further
relief
in
four
other
areas.
and
one
of
those
areas
in
which
there
was
to
be
no
further
judicial
supervision
was
student
assignment.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reject
any
of
the
district
court's
findings
as
clearly
erroneous.
rather,
its
reversal
was
based
on
two
legal
prepositions.
the
first,
contrary
to
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
squarely
held
that
the
school
district
is
legally
responsible
for
what
it
referred
to
as
segregation
caused
by
demographic
changes,
so
long
as
they
occur
during
the
pendency
of
a
desegregation
decree.
and
second,
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
a
school
district
cannot
attain
relief
from
judicial
supervision
in
one
respect
without
qualifying
at
the
same
time
in
all
six
of
the
so-called
green
factors,
and
for
a
period
of
at
least
3
years.
it's
important
to
clarify
at
the
outset
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
dowell
last
term.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
we
are
asking
the
court
for
any
present
ruling
that
we
have
reached
the
end
of
our
judicial
remedial
road.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
it
is
an
important
question,
justice
o'connor.
it's
more
helpful
to
me
to
look
at
those
as
kind
of
guidelines,
as
indicators
among
the
things
that
you
might
look
at,
but
it
is
a
single
indicator.
and
that
is
why
i
regard
that
second
issue
as
much
more
important...
much
less
important,
and
really
following
from
the
first.
because
what
we
are
really
asking
for,
the
only
thing
we're
asking
for
from
this
court
is
relief
from
a
new
expanded
order
imposed
after
we
had
been
operating
under
the
old
one
for
16
years,
an
order
which
said
by
its
terms
that
it
was
to
be
final
and
terminal.
with
the
new
expanded
features,
greatly
expanded,
aimed
exclusively
at
features...
at
circumstances
over
which
we
have
no
control
and
which
we
did
not
cause.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think...
excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
i
think
that
would
depend
on
the
relevant
findings
of
fact
that
would
have
been
made
at
that
time.
now,
in
fact,
we
did
not
go
back--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
think
i
would
be
arguing
the
same
thing,
particularly
if
we
could
have
had
the
additional
finding
that
we
have
here
that
there's
little
that
we
could
have
done
that
would
have
made
a
difference.
both
of
the
court
of
appeals'
rulings
are
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
precedents
of
this
court.
with
regard
to
the
first,
the
issue
of
causation,
starting
at
least
as
early
as
swann
and
very
consistently
thereafter,
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
federal
judicial
authority
is
limited
to
curing
the
constitutional
violation
which
gave
rise
to
the
federal
court's
authority
in
the
first
place.
there
is
no
better
way
to
say
it
than
this
court
said
it
in
milliken
ii,
and
i
quote
very
briefly,
"federal
court
decrees
exceed
appropriate
limits
if
they
are
aimed
at
eliminating
a
condition
that
does
not
violate
the
constitution
or
does
not
flow
from
such
a
violation.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
proposition,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
is
the
stigma
that
is
the
controlling
factor,
has
been
considered
by
the
court
on
several
occasions
and
never
commanded
a
majority
of
the
court.
if
that
all
by
itself,
the
kind
of
stigma...
the
only
kind
of
stigma
that
you
can
have
in
this
case,
which
is
that
there
still
is
racial
imbalance.
that's
just
another
way
of
saying
that
there
is
racial
imbalance.
that's
what
the
eleventh
circuit
says,
that
that's
what
you
have
to
cure.
now,
if
that
is
the
case,
there
have
been
some
erroneous
decisions
that
have
been
entered
in
the
past,
including
this
court's
decision
in
pasadena,
including
judge
rubin's
decision
in
houston,
and
including
the
decision
about
12
years
ago
in
atlanta
itself,
in
which
you
had
gross
racial
imbalance
but
you
couldn't
trace
that
to
anything...
any
unconstitutional
conduct
that
the...
of
which
the
school
board
had
been
guilty.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
those
can
be
difficult
factual
questions.
fortunately
for
the
court
and
for
us
in
this
instance,
we
have
factual
findings
that
deal
squarely
with
that
issue.
and
actually
what
is
involved
here
is
the
basic
distinction
between
de
jure
and
de
facto
segregation.
all
across
the
country
there
are
instances
in
which
there
are
racial
imbalances,
from
saginaw,
michigan,
to
cincinnati,
ohio,
houston,
and
probably
most
significant
of
all
for
these
purposes,
atlanta
itself,
our
next-door
neighbor,
where
it's
actually
considerably
worse
than
it
is
in
dekalb
county.
but
the
consistent
approach
has
been
that
what
you
look
to,
and
there
have
been
at
least
a
half-dozen
instances
in
which
the
court
has
said
that,
is
who
caused
it.
was
this
a
result
of
the
constitutional
violation.
you
will
not
have
very
many
cases
in
which
that
issue
is
posed...
which
a
legal
issue
is
posed
so
cleanly
because
of
the
cleanliness
of
the
findings
of
fact.
there
is
one
case
that
really
squarely
disposes
of
both
issues,
and
that's
pasadena.
the
facts
on
both
questions
were
remarkably
similar.
in
pasadena,
as
in
this
case,
you
had
a
federal
court
order
entered
which
resulted
in
a...
what
the
court
called
a
racially
neutral
system
of
student
assignment.
and
then
you
had
de
facto
changes
in
the
demographics
that
occurred
after
that
time.
with
regard
to
the
first
question
presented,
the
court
said,
and
i
quote,
"that
these
shifts
were
not
attributable
to
any
segregative
actions
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners.
"
and
they
did
so
on
findings
that
were
less
clear
than
we
have
here.
and
with
regard
to
the
second
question,
there
was
a
disagreement
in
pasadena
over
whether
the
school
board's
compliance
with
one
portion
of
the
plan
dealing
with
hiring
and
promoting
teachers,
but
the
non-achievement
of
that
particular
factor,
the
court
said,
did
not,
quote,
"require
the
district
to
rearrange
its
attendance
zones.
"
in
short,
what
pasadena
held
was
that
relief
with
respect
to
student
assignment
need
not
await
the
time
that
the
district
is
entitled
to
relief
with
respect
to
hiring
and
promotion.
and
that's
this
case.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
short
word
about
the
fundamental
principals
of
federalism
and
the
efficient
allocation
of
educational
resources
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
court
said
in
dowell
that
federal
supervision
of
local
school
systems
is
intended
as
a
temporary
measure.
and
what
that
recognizes
is
that,
aside
from
the
need
to
cure
constitutional
violations,
with
which
we're
all
in
agreement,
we're
better
off
if
our
nation's
school
systems
are
run
by
school
boards
rather
than
federal
courts.
and
to
paraphrase
justice
brandeis
in
the
new
state
eyes
case,
school
systems
are
among
our
nation's
most
effective
laboratories.
yet
the
safest
thing
for
a
school
board,
subject
to
a
judicial
decree
to
do
in
response
to
an
innovative
idea,
is
absolutely
nothing.
and
that's
what
this
case
really
comes
down
to.
for
22
years,
the
school
district
has
complied
with
the
neighborhood
attendance
zone
that
was
set
by
hew.
in
that
time
there
have
been
no
further
violations,
no
hint
of
recalcitrance,
and
as
the
district
court
said,
we
have
a
school
board
and
administration
who,
and
these
are
the
district
court's
words,
"are
trying
to
obey
the
law.
"
the
racial
imbalances
that
exist
in
dekalb
county
can
no
more
be
traced
to
a
constitutional
violation
than
they
can
in
chicago
or
philadelphia
or
atlanta.
yet
my
clients
are
now
told
that
they
will
continue
under
judicial
supervision
for
who
knows
how
long,
and
also,
that
they
may
be
subject
to
such
radical
and
greatly
expanded
impositions
as
drastic
gerrymandering
of
school
zones,
busing,
and
that
even
the
neighborhood
plan
is
not
inviable.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
questions,
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
very
easy
at
this
point
in
time
to
suggest
all
kinds
of
things
that
should
have
been
done
in
the
past.
once
again
we
have
a
district
court
finding
that
is
dispositive,
and
that
is
that
nothing
that
could
have
been
done,
that
was
suggested,
in
the
district
court's
view
would
have
led
to
desegregation
that
would
have
happened
any
faster
than
it
did
under
the
procedures
that
were
followed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
this
simply
represents
a
shift
from
the
position
that
they
earlier
took.
i
will
refer
you
to
the
district
court's
opinion,
which
says
that,
on
35a,
plaintiffs
concede--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i'm
sorry,
the
petition...
the
appendix
to
the
cert
of
petition.
"plaintiffs
concede
that
this
action
effectively
desegregated
the
dcss
for
a
period
of
time.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
know,
but
they
conceded
that
in
an
earlier
time
according
to
the
district
court.
i
wasn't--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not.
and
i
want
to
make
this
very
clear.
there
is
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
even
vaguely
implies
that
anything
the
school
board
did
led
to
this
problem.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
rests
on
a
legal
foundation
and
not
on
a
factual
foundation.
and
it
cannot
be
better
summarized
than
in
this
single
sentence
which
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
20a,
of
the
cert
of
petition
appendix.
"we
also
reject
the
district
court's
refusal
to
require
the
dcss
to
eradicate
segregation
caused
by
demographic
changes.
"
and
that's
what's
got
to
be
reversed.
that's
what's
causing
the
mischief.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
it
does,
justice
stevens.
and
i'm...
thank
you
for
asking
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
only
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
and
the
case
really
ought
to
go
back
to
the
district
court.
there
is
nothing--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
no,
no,
no.
we
still
have
proof
to
make
back
before
the
district
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
still
have
these
other
two.
we're
ready
to
make
the
proof.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
think
so.
by
the
district
court,
but
that's
the
procedure
in
which
i
would
proceed.
thank
you.
