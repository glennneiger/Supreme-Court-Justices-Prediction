justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here?
supposing,
first
of
all,
i
assume
you
don't
challenge,
or
maybe
you
do,
the
figures
that
the
red
brief
contains
in
the
early
part
of
the
brief
that
are
not
covered
by
the
findings
of
fact
dealing
with
the
period
between
'69
and
'75.
and
during
those
early
years,
there's
a
trend
of
increasing
the
number
of
more
than
50
percent
black
schools:
two
in
'69,
two
in
'73,
three
in
'71,
and
so
forth.
my
question
is
in
1969
or
'70,
would
it
have
been
the
duty,
or
would
the
district
judge
have
had
the
power
to
prevent
that
increased
concentration,
even
if
it
were
attributable
entirely
to
demographic
changes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
whole...
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
the
relevant
finding
of
fact
is
(a),
it
is
attributable
to
people
moving
into
the
county
from
atlanta,
and
(b),
there
will
be
as
a
result
of
that
change,
racially
identifiable
schools
only
a
year
or
two
after
the
decree
was
entered.
and
they
asked
for
relief
right
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
starr,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
it
really
wouldn't
have
mattered
if
the
plaintiff
had
objected
violently
all
along
the
line
because
they
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
any
protection
from
demographic
changes
not
caused
by
the
dual
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
to
boil
it
down,
what
you're
saying
is
they
really
wouldn't
have
had
a
valid
argument
to
advance
even
if
they
had
argued
from
the
very
beginning
that
something
should
have
been
done
to
prevent
the
creation
of
a
lot
of
racially
identifiable
schools
shortly
after
the
decree
was
entered
if
they
were
caused
by
demographic
changes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
well
be
right,
but
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
see
why
it
would
matter
for
the
reasonably
foreseeable
because
the
thing
that
was
foreseeable
was
not,
under
your
argument,
was
not
the
consequence
of
illegal
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
in
good
faith?
if
they
said
well,
we
can
anticipate
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
move
into
the
county
because
there
is
a
lot
of
business
developing
here
and
so
forth,
but
that's
not
our
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
don't
see
how
foreseeability
changes
it
a
bit.
suppose
they
foresaw
the
whole
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
about
your
theory
of
back
in
1976.
you
say
the
earlier
district
court
opinion
indicates
that
the
school
board's
actions
intentionally
contributed
to
the
segregation
in
the
schools.
but
supposing
your
view
is
that
maybe
it
contributed
marginally,
may
have
affected
maybe
5
percent
of
the
assignment
in
some
way,
but
95
percent
are
still
contributable
to
demographic
changes.
how
do
you
bring
that
forward
to
today?
what's
the
consequence?
and
if
you
say,
you
know,
the
basic
problem
still
is
demographic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
were
required
to
take
that
action
by
the
terms
of
the
actual
decree
that
was
entered
or
by
the
overriding
obligation
under
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question
about
the
change
in
population.
is
it
all...
the
demographic
change
all
attributable
to
black
people
moving
into
the
county...
into
southern
part
of
the
county,
or
is
some
of
it
also
white
people
moving
from
the
south
to
the
northern
part
of
the
county?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both.
is
there
any
difference
in
legal
significance
between
those
two
changes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
i'm
looking
at
the
chart
you're
describing.
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
in
the
period
of
'70
to
'75
apparently
there
is
almost
as
many
additional
whites
in
the
county
as
additional
blacks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee,
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
we
agree
100
percent
with
you
that
that
proposition
is
wrong.
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
decree
should
be
vacated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no,
i'm
asking
does
it...
the
relief
you
ultimately
seek
is
to
vacate
the
decree
so
you
don't
ever
have
to
run
into
court
and
get
permission
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
review
should
be
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
decree
of
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
still
doesn't
answer
my
question.
my
question,
though,
is
still
supposing
that
you
corrected
factor
6
or
5,
or
whatever
it
was,
as
of
today,
just
assume.
and
you
go
back
to
the
district
court.
are
you
then
entitled
to
have
the
decree
vacated
tomorrow?
