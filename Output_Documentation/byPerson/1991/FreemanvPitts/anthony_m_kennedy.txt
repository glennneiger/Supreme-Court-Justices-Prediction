justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
you
agree
that
the
school
district
had
the
obligation
at
the
outset
in
1970-71
to
correct
that
imbalance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
what
you
are
saying
that
there
is
really
at
least
a
two-phase
aspect
to
the
remedial
period:
a
primary
phase
in
which
there
must
be
racial
balance
regardless
of
the
cause,
plus
a
disengagement
phase
that
follows
it,
and
that
you
are
now
in
the
disengagement
phase?
does
that
summarize
what
you
are
going
to
tell
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
agree
that
in
the
initial
period
when
there
is
imbalance,
even
if
that
imbalance
is
caused
by
demographic
factors,
that
the
school
district
had
a
duty
to
realign
the
attendance
zones
to
cause
racial
balance
to
the
extent
practical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
constitutional
violation
is
that
this
causes
a
stigma
to
the
entire
black
community.
and
you're
telling
us
in
answer
to
me
and
to
justice
stevens,
that
even
if
you
have
racially
identifiable
schools
within
1
year
after
a
decree
is
entered
and
there
has
been
1
year
of
balanced,
that
that's
the
end
of
the
court's
concern.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
nature
of
the
violation
extends
beyond
that
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
it
plausible
to
say
that
the
stigma
is
also
controlled
by
the
time
that's
elapsed
so
that
the
stigma
that
existed,
say,
in
1971
is
much
more
clear
to
the
community,
is
much
more
palpable,
much
more
tangible
than
in
1991?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
had.
what
would
have
been
your
response
to
justice
stevens'
concern
and
mine
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
an
obligation
in
the
immediate
period
after
the
desegregation
plan
is
implemented
to
demographic
changes?
is
there
a
continuing
duty
to
balance
in
this
primary
remedial
phase...
initial
remedial
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
pasadena
there
had
been
desegregation
in
place
for
a
number
of
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
understanding
that
if
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
is
affirmed
that
the
district
court
will
then
be
under
an
immediate
duty
to
direct
the
school
board
to
take
all
steps
necessary
forthwith
to
have
racial
balancing
throughout
dekalb
county
in
student
assignments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
if
it
had
been
1970,
you
answer
to
my
question
would
have
been
yes,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
changed
between
now
and
1970?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
then
the
duty
is
the
same.
even
though
they
are
caused
by
demographic
changes,
there
has
to
be
absolute
racial
equality
in
student
assignments
by
all
means
necessary
to
accomplish
that
end.
isn't
that
the
reasonable
and
plausible
interpretation
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
record
about
subdistricting
as
a
remedy
that
the
board
might
have
chosen.
can
you
explain
to
me
briefly
what
that
is?
could
dekalb
county...
was
the
suggestion
that
dekalb
county
just
break
itself
into
three
and
then
proceed
district
by
district?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
that
had
been
true,
given
the
demographics,
then
southern
dekalb
county
would
have
been
almost
entirely
black
within
the
district...
within
the
subdistrict,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
finding
is
the
demographic
changes
were
inevitable.
so
as
i
understood
that
suggestion,
if
they
had
adopted
geographic
subdistricting,
say,
into
three...
northern,
central,
southern...
you
would
have
had
an
all
black
southern
district
based
on
the
inevitability
of
the
demographic
changes.
and
i
find
that
a
very
strange
suggestion
for
the
petitioners
to
be
urging
on
the
board.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
involves
a
court
order
desegregation
decree
for
the
school
system
of
dekalb
county,
georgia.
this
school
district
has
73,000
students
in
kindergarten
through
high
school,
and
it
is
the
32nd
largest
school
district
in
the
nation.
it
has
been
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
since
1969,
when
it
was
ordered
to
dismantle
its
segregated
school
system.
the
school
district
implemented
a
neighborhood
school
plan
that
achieved
substantial
racial
balance
but
soon
an
imbalance
occurred.
the
school
district
underwent
a
dramatic
change
in
demographics.
what
had
been
a
black
student
population
of
something
less
than
6%
in
1969
became
a
47%
black
student
population
by
1986.
in
that
year
the
school
district
sought
final
dismissal
of
the
case.
all
concede
that
the
district
had
not
adjusted
to
the
demographic
changes
so
that
there
was
substantial
racial
imbalance
in
student
assignments
to
the
various
schools
in
the
district.
half
of
the
black
students
in
the
district
attended
schools
that
were
over
90%
black.
of
the
22
high
schools,
five
were
over
90%
black
while
five
were
over
80%
white.
the
district
court
found
that
the
school
district
had
achieved
maximum
practical
desegregation
between
1969
and
1986,
and
that
the
massive
demographic
changes
that
had
led
to
residential
segregation
and
that
the
school
attendants'
patterns
were
not
caused
by
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
school
district.
the
court
found
that
the
district
had
complied
with
its
decree
in
four
categories:
student
assignments,
transportation,
physical
facilities,
and
extracurricular
activities.
accordingly,
it
ruled
that
it
would
order
no
further
remedies
in
these
areas.
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
school
district
was
not
in
full
compliance
with
reference
to
three
other
categories.
on
of
these
was
the
assignment
of
teachers
and
principals
to
create
a
better
racial
balance.
the
court
retained
jurisdiction
over
the
case
and
ordered
further
remedies,
but
only
as
to
those
areas
such
as
teacher
and
principal
assignment
where
the
school
district
was
not
in
full
compliance.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
ruled
that
until
the
district
was
in
full
compliance
in
every
respect,
the
trial
court
was
obligated
to
keep
control
over
all
school
operations.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
this
would
require
further
court
orders
to
achieve
racial
balance
in
student
assignments
including
remedies
that
might
be,
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
administratively
awkward,
inconvenient,
and
bizarre
such
as
busing.
we
granted
certiorari
in
the
school
district's
petition.
we
now
reverse.
we
hold
that
in
the
course
of
supervising
school
desegregation
plans
federal
courts
have
the
authority
to
relinquish
supervision
and
control
of
school
districts
in
incremental
stages
before
full
compliance
has
been
achieved
in
every
area
of
school
operations.
remedies
are
justified
only
in
so
far
as
they
advance
the
ultimate
objective
of
alleviating
the
initial
constitutional
violation.
partial
relinquishment
of
judicial
control
where
justified
by
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
an
important
and
significant
step
in
fulfilling
the
district
court's
duty
to
return
the
operations
and
control
of
school's
to
local
authorities.
next
question
is
whether
under
the
standards
that
we
set
forth
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
the
district
court's
order
for
incremental
withdrawal
of
supervision
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
again,
we
find
the
court
of
appeals
erred
that
there
was
racial
imbalance
in
school
attendance
zones
was
not
tantamount
to
a
showing
that
the
school
district
was
in
non-compliance
with
the
decree
or
with
its
duties
under
the
law.
racial
balance
is
not
to
be
achieved
for
its
own
sake.
it
is
to
be
pursued
where
racial
imbalance
has
been
caused
by
a
constitutional
violation.
once
the
racial
imbalance
due
to
the
de
jure
violation
has
been
remedied,
the
school
district
is
under
no
duty
to
remedy
imbalance
that
is
caused
by
demographic
factors.
where
resegregation
is
not
a
product
of
state
action
but
of
private
choices,
it
does
not
have
constitutional
implications.
it
is
beyond
the
authority
and
beyond
the
practical
ability
of
the
federal
courts
to
try
to
counteract
to
these
kinds
of
continuous
and
massive
demographic
shifts.
to
attempt
such
results
would
require
an
ongoing
and
never-ending
supervision
by
the
court's
school
districts
simply
because
they
were
once
desegregated.
residential
housing
choices
and
their
attendant
effects
on
the
racial
composition
of
schools
present
an
ever-changing
pattern,
one
difficult
to
address
to
judicial
remedies.
it
was
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
examine
the
reasons
for
the
racial
imbalance
in
school
attendance
before
ordering
an
impractical
and
no
doubt
massive
expenditure
of
funds
to
achieve
racial
balance.
here,
there
has
been
17
years
of
efforts
to
implement
the
court's
comprehensive
desegregation
plan
in
a
school
district
where
there
were
fundamental
changes
in
population
patterns,
changes
not
attributable
to
the
form
of
de
jure
regime
or
any
later
actions
by
school
officials.
the
district
court's
determination
to
order
instead
the
expenditure
of
scarce
resources
in
areas
such
as
the
quality
of
education
where
full
compliance
had
not
yet
been
achieved
underscores
the
wise
uses
of
discretion
in
framing
equitable
remedies.
for
a
number
of
reasons
explained
in
a
lengthy
opinion,
we
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
may
order
further
remand
to
the
district
courts
for
findings
under
the
standards
we
have
announced
today.
