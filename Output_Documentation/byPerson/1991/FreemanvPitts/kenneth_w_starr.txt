mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
what
has
been
said,
let
me
focus
on
two
aspects
of
the
discussion.
the
first
is
causation.
causation,
we
believe,
is
a
critical
part
of
the
inquiry.
that
is
to
say,
as
mr.
lee
indicated,
this
court
has
said
quite
frequently
that
a
federal
court
remedy
is
excessive
if
it
goes
beyond
seeking
to
cure
the
constitutional
violation.
the
1969
decree
that
was
entered
into
here
was
a
comprehensive
plan.
it
was
agreed
to
by
all
the
parties.
as
mr.
lee
indicated,
this
was
a
plan
that
was
formulated
with
the
guidance
of
hew.
it
was
a
plan
formulated
with
the
guidance
of
this
court,
the
demand
of
this
court
in
green,
that
plans
be
developed
to
work
and
to
work
now.
i
think
the
critical
thing
about
then
the
way
this
plan
was
carried
out
was
that
the
school
board
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
acting
in
good
faith.
it
sought
to
achieve
the
maximum
amount
of
desegregation
that
was
practicable.
it
instituted
voluntarily
two
programs
in
the
wake
of
the
demographic
changes
that
swept
over
dekalb
county:
the
majority
to
minority
transfer
program,
which
this
court
identified
in
swann
as
being
a
very
important
part
of
the
desegregation
plan.
as
soon
as
swann
came
down,
the
school
board
voluntarily,
with
the
plaintiffs'
approbation,
instituted
such
a
plan,
as
well
as
a
magnet
school
plan.
for
6
years
there
was
silence
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
talked
about
the
developments
beginning
in
early
1970,
but
the
plaintiffs
did
not
come
in
to
court
to
question
the
efficacy
of
the
plan.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
if
the
demographic
change
cannot
be
laid
at
the
feet
of
the
school
board,
the
answer
is
no.
this
court
answered
that
question
no
in
pasadena.
in
a
very
real
sense--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
plan
as
i...
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about
the
facts
in
pasadena,
but
the
demographic
changes
in
pasadena
began
very
promptly
after
the
plan
went
into
effect
in
1970,
so
that
in
1971
and
'72,
very
early
on,
there
were
in
fact
racially
identifiable
schools.
the
key
is
not
whether
there
is
racial
identifiability.
the
key
is
what
is
the
action
of
the
school
officials.
have
they
in
fact
contributed
to
the
creation
of
racial
identifiability
through
racist
assignment
policies
or
other
forms
of
policies.
but
if
there
is
not
causation,
then
the
school
board
gets
to
look
at
the
decree.
the
decree
is
a
final
judgment.
at
page
61
of
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
this
decree,
that
everyone
agreed
to,
stated
by
its
terms
that
this
is
a
final
and
terminal
plan
of
desegregation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
they
had
not
been...
because
it
may
be,
and
i
agree
with
mr.
lee,
that
the
facts
are
terribly
important
in
each
of
these
cases.
at
a
theoretical
level,
i
have
to
say
that
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
federal
judicial
power
and
the
power
that
the
courts
enjoy
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
power
must
go
to
remedying
a
violation.
we
do
have
to
identify
a
violation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
stevens,
i--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
they
should
certainly
be
heard
to
say
this
plan
was
defective
for
the
following
reasons.
it
was
reasonably
foreseeable
in
light
of
the
nature
of
this
plan
that
this
would
have
occurred.
it
is
critical
in
these
cases,
and
the
united
states
fully--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
reasonable
foreseeability
is
important
because
it
goes
to
good
faith.
if
the
board
was
party
to
a
decree
that
was
not
in
fact
entered
into
in
good
faith,
if
it
felt--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
they
could
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
could
very
well
say
our
duty
is
to
treat
all
students
alike
and
not
to
treat
them
differently
on
grounds
of
race,
and
that
we're
entitled
to
have
a
proper
and
appropriate
educational
system
as
long
as
we
don't
engage
in
that.
now
what
we
do
have
to
do,
and
this
is
getting
back
to
the
point
that
seems
to
be
of
control...
of
concern
to
the
court,
is
to
dismantle
that
prior
dual
system.
and
what
does
dismantling
mean?
i
think
it
does
mean
getting
at
the
green
factors,
those
six
aspects
of
the
school
system,
to
make
sure
that
no
school
is
being
essentially
labeled
by
the
stay
as
a--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
i
don't
think
so.
footnote
5
in
pasadena
looks
very
strongly
the
other
way.
so
does
the
learning
of
three
united
states
courts
of
appeals
that
have
focused
on
this
and
this
is
why.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
readily
agree,
they
conceded
at
the
district
court
level,
that
in
three
of
the
green
factors
all
remnants
of
the
prior
de
jure
system
had
been
entirely
eradicated.
it
would
be
passing
strange,
and
in
our
view,
would
be
a
violation
of
the
limitations
of
judicial
power
under
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
remedy
now
to
be
directed
at
those
three
integral
parts
of
a
school
system
that
had
been
found
to
be
completely
desegregated.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
there
were
a
finding
that
that
were
necessary...
i
would...
i
certainly
would
agree
if
it
were
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
the
dismantling.
that
would
be
quite
a
different
matter.
but
what
the
court
does
have
the
comfort
of
in
this
case
is
the
district
court's
finding
at
page
45a
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
nothing
that
this
school
board
could
have
done
would
have
made
a
difference
by...
by
virtue
of
the
overwhelming
demographic
shift
in
dekalb
county.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
that
way.
i
do
think
that
it
does
in
fact
raise
a
question
that
the
school
board
might
very
well
say
we
have
completed
our
duties
in
that
respect,
nothing
more
needs
to
be
done.
and
then
the
critical
judgment,
and
it
is
a
judgment
by
the
district
court,
is
whether
that
board
is
acting
in
good
faith.
here,
the
court
has
the
benefit
of
two
judges
having
concluded
that
this
school
board
has
been
acting
in
good
faith
since
1969.
two
judges
who
have
had
this
case
before
them
have
said
this
is
a
school
board
that
is
seeking
the
interest
and
welfare
of
all
of
its
students.
and
the
two
areas
where
there
is
still
work
to
be
done
are
areas
that
the
school
board
already
believes
it
has
corrected,
and
indeed
are
rather
technical
requirements...
the
singleton
requirement
and
the
like...
in
terms
of
the
seamless
web
point,
racial
identifiability
of
the
faculty.
it's
important
to
remember
that
this
school
board
has
desegregated
the
faculty.
not
a
single
school
in
this
district
has
had
a
majority
black
faculty
since
1969.
the
fifth
circuit
law,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
imposes
a
very
rigorous
requirement,
the
singleton
requirement,
with
respect
to
ratios
in
each
school.
that
ratio
can
be
met
by
the
exercise
of
something
that
this
school
board
did
not
want
to
do.
it
did
not
want
to
engage
in
the
mandatory
reassignments
of
teachers.
it
has
now
been
told
by
the
district
court
you
must
do
that.
you
should
have
been
mandating...
even
though
the
teachers
didn't
want
it,
you
should
have
been
mandating
that
they
go
to
different
schools,
and
you
have
to
take
additional
steps
in
ensure
that
expenditures
per
capita
are
entirely
equalized.
this
obviously
remains
for
the
district
court
on
remand.
the
point
is
this:
those
points
did
not
give
rise
to
any
indication
at
all
that
there
was
bad
faith.
i
thank
the
court.
