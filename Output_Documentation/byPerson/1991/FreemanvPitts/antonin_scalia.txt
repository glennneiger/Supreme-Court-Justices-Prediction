excuse
me,
what
do
you
mean
by
fewer
resources?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
wondering
how
that
could
be
without
a
finding
of
discrimination.
is
it
just
that...
i
suppose,
the
principal
factor
is
faculty
salaries,
and
there
are
just
teachers
who
don't
want
to
move
to
other
schools,
so
that
you
get
more
senior
teachers
in
some
schools.
is
that
the
principal
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hansen,
suppose
you
have
a
school
district
that
is
found
to
have
been
violating
the
law
only
in
faculty
assignment
and
in
allocation
of
resources.
it
has
not
been
assigning
students
to
schools
on
a
racial
basis,
but
in
fact,
it
has
been
assigning
faculty
and
allocating
resources
on
a
racial
basis.
would
it
be
necessary
when
a
remedy
for
that
violation
is
imposed
by
the
federal
court,
that
the
remedy
include
student
allocation?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
the
factors
can
hang
separately.
it
depends
on
whether
one
factor
affects
another
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
is
it
presumptively
or
inescapably?
if
it's
just
presumptively,
i
would
say
the
district
court
here
considered
it
and
the
presumption
no
longer
stands.
he
says
we
can
remedy
the
two
problems
that
still
exist
without
affecting
student
assignment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
addressed
the
question
implicitly.
i
mean,
it
certainly
thought
it
was
providing
as
much
of
a
remedy
as
is
now
needed
to
end
whatever
discrimination
there
is.
and
it
said
it's
enough
to
do
it
in
just
these
two
areas
and
not
in
the
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait
a
minute.
segregated
in
that
sense
is
not
against
the
law.
i
mean,
you're
saying
it
was
as
segregated.
