mr.
lee,
did
the
district
court
consider
the
possibility
that
the
demographic
changes
in
the
seventies
were
attributable
somehow
to
racially
identifiable
schools
in
the
district?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
no
finding
really
dealt
with
that.
so
we're
not
sure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
are
asking
that
we
say
that
with
respect
to
some
of
the
so-called
green
factors,
that
it
apply
incrementally
some
how.
and
i'd
like
to
ask
whether
you
think
the
green
factors
represent
distinct
constitutional
violations
or
is
there
a
single
violation
that
we're
dealing
with?
i
think
this
is
a
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
going
to
look
at
those
factors
incrementally?
mightn't
one
factor
need
remedies
in
other
areas
of
the
factors
to
make
it
all
come
into
place?
if
there's
then
initially
a
single
violation,
don't
we
have
to
see
that
all
the
green
factors
are
met
for
a
period
of
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
that
were
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
the
requirements
on
the
other
two
factors
that
haven't
been
met?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that,
strictly
speaking,
true?
the
district
court
found
the
current
violations
to
be
only
with
respect
to
per
pupil
expenditure
and
the
assignment
of
the
teachers
and
principals.
nevertheless,
the
eleventh
circuit
ordered
the
district
court
to
look
at
all
kinds
of
things
like
gerrymandering
of
school
zones
and
reorganizing
grades
and
possibly
busing.
and
it
certainly
would
be
possible
to
say
that
those
remedies
are
more
extensive
than
the
violations
to
be
cured,
that
there's
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
of
course,
but
that
nevertheless,
the
remedies
have
to
be
tailored
to
the
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
in
response
to
my
questions
that
we
got
some
response
that
conceivably
they
may
be
interrelated
and
that
the
remedies,
conceivably,
could
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
don't
have
a
finding
to
that
effect.
