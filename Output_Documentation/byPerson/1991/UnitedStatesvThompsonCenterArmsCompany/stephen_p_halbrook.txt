mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
atf's
position
that
a
complete
pistol
and
a
complete
rifle...
that
is,
two
receivers,
a
short
barrel,
a
long
barrel,
and
a
shoulder
stock...
do
not
constitute
an
nfa
weapon
unless
actually
assembled
as
such.
these
are
the
words
of
the
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasurer
edward
stevenson,
which
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
at
43.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
it's
a
22
rim
fire
caliber.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
it's
a
minor
caliber.
however,
you
can
interchange
these
barrels...
that's
a
commercially
attractive
feature
of
this
firearm...
with
other
calibers
so
that,
for
example,
the
company
that's
in
the
record
offers
30-30
rifle
barrels
for
hunting
deer,
things
like
that,
so
it
is
interchangeable.
the
unit
here
is
a
22
rim
fire.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
no,
you
don't,
your
honor.
that's
the
beauty
of
this
particular
kind
of
firearm.
it's
only
a
single
shot,
so
it
doesn't
have
a
different
mechanism
for
different
calibers.
you
change
the
barrels.
you
can
use
the
same
receiver
to
have...
for
example,
a
30-30...
if
you
have
it
in
the
carbine
version,
you
can
have
30-30
deer
barrel,
or
you
could
use
a
22
rim
fire
barrel
for
like
target
shooting
or
squirrel
hunting
or
something
minor
like
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
rim
fire
cartridge
is
the
smallest
cartridge
made,
and
it
only
means
that
the
firing
pin
hits
the
rim
of
the
cartridge
to
make
it
go
off,
whereas
most
bigger
calibers
have
a
center
fire
which
hits
the
primer--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--in
the
middle.
but
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
a
consumer
has
to
have
two
receivers
instead
of
just
one
receiver.
the
receivers
are
identical.
i'm
not
sure
how
well
this--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
post
hoc
attorney
talk
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
the
agency's
position--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--the
agency
has
never
taken
that--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
for
the
first
time
in
1985
the
agency
took
the
position
that
you
could
have
a
complete
pistol
and
a
complete
carbine.
and
when
you
look
at
the
quotation
from
mr.
stevenson
that
i
read...
when
my
open,
he
said
that
means
two
receivers,
a
short
barrel,
long
barrel,
and
a
shoulder
stock.
the
agency
has
never
said
that
a
complete
carbine
and
a
complete
pistol
if
they're
disassembled
makes
them
into
short-barrel
rifles,
because
you
disassemble
these
to
clean
them
or
for
a
lot
of
other...
to
change
barrels,
for
other
purposes.
that's
an
argument
that
we've
heard
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
and
that
argument
was
never
made
in
the
claims
court.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
accurate,
and
that's
throughout
the
record
in
this
case.
all
the
correspondence
between
atf
director
higgins
and
thompson/center
arms
and
between
mr.
stevenson,
the
treasury
official,
make
that
clear.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
not
only
that...
that's
accurate,
justice
scalia.
not
only
that,
but
atf
is
well
aware
that
the
attractive
feature
of
the
contender
system
is
that
you
can
change
the
barrel,
so
you're
always
changing
barrels,
even
with
just
a
pistol.
just
leave
the
carbine
kit
out
of
the
case,
if
you
wish.
the
pistol
is...
it's
in
the
record.
we
have
a
company
catalogue
here,
and
they
sell
lots
of
different
barrels
for
different
target
events
and
different
kinds
of
hunting.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
getting
a
lot
closer
to
one,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
definition
of
rifle
does
include
the
term
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder.
so
that's
getting
in
a
very
gray
area,
and
i
would
think
that
a
manufacturer
would
not
want
to
do
something
like
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
when
we
apply
the
rule
of...
let
me
distinguish
two
kinds
of
rifles.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
of
course,
the
answer
is
yes
for
a
certain
type...
yes.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
it
would
be--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--if
it's
an
instantly
attachable
shoulder
stock.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
my
yes
relates
to
the
pistol
and
instantly
attachable
shoulder
stock
that
those
revenue
rulings
mr.
feldman
was
talking
about
were
talking
about.
they
were
intended
only
to
be
short-barrel
rifles.
they
were
made
into
short-barrel
rifles.
and
in
fact
there's
a
readily
restorable
definition
here
that
would
continue
my
answer
being
yes,
because
once
you
put
it
together
as
a
short-barrel
rifle,
even
though
you--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
if
this--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--when
we
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
an
ambiguous
statute
i
agree
that
that
would
not
be
a
firearm,
and
when
we
looked
at
the
contrasting
definitions,
the
three
other
nfa
firearms
that
have
combinations
of
parts
definitions
and
the
absence
of
that
language
here
and
the
definition
of
make
here
as
including
putting
together.
and
if
i
was
in
a
criminal
case
i
would
definitely
argue
that
that
would
not
be
a
short-barrel
rifle,
the
hypothetical.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
don't
think
so.
the
circumvention
argument
applies
to
the
beautiful
shotgun
on
display
downstairs
that
belonged
to
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
could
be
sawed
off
probably
in
30
or
40
seconds.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
my
view
would
have
to
be
no
when
we
construe
the
statute
strictly.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
but
notice,
though,
that
the
statute
says,
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
and
if
those
parts
are
intended
to
be
assembled
and
fired
from
the
shoulder
with
a
barrel
less
than
16
inches,
it
is
by
definition
a
short-barrel
rifle.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
it's
a
lot
closer
to
being
made,
and
if
that
intent
element
is
there
then
a
prosecutor
would
be
over
that
hurdle.
i
think...
it's
application
of
law
to
facts,
and
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
and
the
circumstances
as
far
as
this
product
go
is
that
it's--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
but
the
definition--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--includes...
that's
an
objective
standard
as
to
what
a
shoulder
stock
is,
and
that's
in
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
not
what
the
statute
said.
if
the
statute
with
criminal
penalty
says
that
to
apply
it
to
a
person,
it...
this
object
has
to
be
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
then
it
would
depend
on
that
person's
intent.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
not
completely.
most
of
the
circuits...
not
this
court,
but
most
of
the
circuits
have
held
that
you
don't
even
have
to
know
it's
an
nfa
firearm.
all
you
have
to
know
is
it's
any
kind
of
gun
and
you're
guilty,
and
there's
three
circuits
that
have
gone
away
from
that
view
now,
but
that's
why
this
case
is
also
so
important.
it's
in
the
record
that
tens
of
thousands
of
carbine
kits
were
sold
through
1985
with
batf
approval,
and
if
this
statute
really
means
what
the
government
says,
all
of
those
carbine
kits
that
are
possessed
with
those
pistols...
these
were
sold
by
other
companies...
all
these
tens
of
thousands
of
people
are
guilty
of
a
felony
offense,
because
there's
no
knowledge
requirement
in
most
circuits
that
you
know
that
it's
an
nfa
firearm,
and
if
the
difference
here
is
that
you're
supposed
to
know
it's
an
nfa
firearm
because
only
one
receiver
is
present
rather
than
two
receivers
being
present,
all
these
distinctions
that
really
are
not
in
the
statute
but
the
agency
invented,
then
we've
got
a
real
problem
with
notice
and
due
process
and
issues
like
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
if
what
the
government
has
said
for
the
first
time
here
today...
if
that's
accurate,
then
that's
a
real
problem,
because
thompson/center
has
been
marketing
these
kits...
not
kits,
but
complete
carbines
and
complete
pistols...
since
1985
when
batf
director
steven
higgins
ruled
that
that
was
not
an
nfa
firearm,
that
one
person
in
possession
of
both
complete
guns
does
not
possess
an
nfa
firearm.
i
noticed
in
the
government
briefs
that
they
start
using
terms
like
separate
marketing
of
these
items
as
if
they've
got
to
go
to
different
people,
but
the
administrative
record,
the
record
in
this
case,
is
clear
that
the
complete
rifle
and
the
complete
pistol
being
possessed
by
a
person,
that's
not
considered
a
violation.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
i
don't
think
congress...
well,
it
certainly
hasn't
passed
such
a
law,
but
i
would
say
that
that's
why
it's
important,
in
applying
law
to
facts
as
we're
doing
here,
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
specific
case,
and
if
we
interpret
the
statute
narrowly
to
exclude
this
item
from
the
national
firearms
act,
we
don't
do
anything
about
all
these
potential
hypotheticals
that
the
government
has
raised.
there
may
be
some
circumstances
where
something
is
so
on
the
verge
of
being
a
short-barrel
rifle
and
so
intended
to
be
a
short-barrel
rifle
that
it
is
one,
and
the
court
could
easily
say
that
this
is
not,
and
that
these
other
items
would
be.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
accurate.
that--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--absolutely.
normally
the
term
uzi
means
a
machine
gun.
machine
gun
is
defined
as
a
combination
of
parts
from
which
a
machine
gun
can
be
assembled
when
possessed
by
a
person.
and
when
we
made
that
clear
in
our
brief
that
that's
why
all
this
would
not
apply
to
an
uzi,
the
government
came
back
and
said
well,
just
because
it's
more
powerful
that
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
our
point
is
that
it's
normally
a
different
weapon.
now,
there
is
a--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
justice
souter's
question
is...
the
answer
is
yes,
that
the
easy
answer
to
that
question
is
that
an
uzi
machine
gun
is
defined
as
a
combination
of
parts
from
which
a
machine
gun
can
be
assembled.
that
doesn't
apply
here,
and
that's
the
easy
answer
to
the
question
about
the
distinction
between
rifle
and
machine
gun
as
defined
in
the
nfa.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
as
i
understand
it
is
if
we
had
a
rifle,
we
had
a
shoulder
stock
not
attached
to
the
receiver,
perhaps,
and
a
barrel
not
attached
to
the
receiver,
and
it's
a
short
barrel,
then
that's
getting
a
lot
closer
to
being
a
short-barrel
rifle
because
of
the
intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder
standard.
and
i
might
add
that
batf
agreed
with
my
position
that
this--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--if
it's
packaged
and
intended
to
be
sold
together
and--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--justice
stevens,
that's
one
of
those
questions
that
the
answer--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--is
maybe,
because
the
statute
doesn't
clearly
apply
to
that.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
the
term
rifle
does
not
include
combination
of
parts.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
that's
a--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--if
i
was
defending
a
criminal
case,
that's
what
i'd
argue.
but
that's
one
of
those
cases
about
how
hard
facts
make
bad
law.
i
realize
the
dilemma
you're
in,
but
that
just
doesn't...
that
reasoning
doesn't
apply
to
this
product.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
my
answer
to
that's
going
to
be
no,
that
that's
not
a
rifle
under
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
it's
just
a
question--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--in
the
one
in
the
case
at
bar.
i
want
to
point
out
just
a
little
bit
has
been
said
about
the
rules
of
construction,
about
criminal
statutes,
taxing
statutes,
and
the
term
deference
perhaps
might
be
addressed
briefly.
we've
argued
two
rules
of
construction,
namely
that
a
taxing
statute,
if
it's
ambiguous,
as
we
believe
the
government
has
manufactured
ambiguity
here,
but
then
it
does...
it's
interpreted
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
and
against
the
government,
and
the
reasoning
in
the
gould
case
and
in
the
white
v.
aaronson
case
and
others
decided
by
this
court
is
that
if
congress
wants
to
tax
something
it
should
say
so
explicitly,
that
the
application
of
law
to
fact
should
be
clear
enough
so
that
people
can
obey
the
law.
but
the
more
important
rule
i
believe
is
the
rule
that
this
court
in
the
crandon
case
last
term
addressed,
the
rule
that
an
ambiguous
term
in
a
criminal
statute
has
to
be
interpreted
according
to
the
rule
of
lenity
against
the
government
and
in
favor
of
the
person
to
whom
it
may
apply.
an
opinion
written
by
justice
stevens
in
which
there
was
a
strong
concurring
opinion
by
justice
scalia
talking
about,
in
more
detail,
the
fact
that
you
never
defer
to
the
government
in
respect
to
a
statute
with
strong
criminal
penalties,
which
would,
in
justice
scalia's
words,
replace
the
rule
of
lenity
with
a
rule
of
severity.
but
even
if
we
get
into
the
deference
rule,
then
let
me
say
this.
the
government
always
cites
the
second
part
of
the
two-part
test
that
chevron
usa
discusses.
the
first
part
of
that
test
is
that
if
the
statute
is
clear
then
there
is
to
be
no
deference
to
agency
opinion.
congress
has
spoken,
and
no
deference
is
appropriate.
it's
only
if
a
statute's
ambiguous,
and
even
then
those
cases
are
decided
in
civil
matters,
in
matters
without
severe
criminal
consequences.
the
example...
the
actual
case
that
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
referring
to
about
a
rule
of
lenity
being
applied
in
a
tax
case
was
commissioner
v.
acker,
where
that
was
not
even
a
criminal
penalty.
it
was
a
strong
civil
penalty,
however,
and
the
rule
of
lenity
was
held
still
to
apply,
because
the
conduct
was
being
punished
even
with
the
civil
penalty.
but
if...
even
if
we
were
to
defer
to
the
government's
interpretation,
when
you
look
at
how
the
government
has
interpreted
this
statute,
how
the
agency
interpreted
the
statute,
particularly
just
after
passage
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
when
the
agency...
well,
when
congress
determined
what
is
a
combination
of
part...
what
is
a
combination
of
parts
plus
intent,
and
what
is
not
so
defined,
when
congress
clarified
how
we
interpret
these
definitions,
the
agency
began
to
issue
letter
opinions
where
they
held
that
the
kinds
of
items
we're
talking
about
here
were
not
considered
to
be
short-barrel
rifles.
there
is
a
consistent
line
of
administrative
interpretation
between
1971
and
1985
that
we've
got
in
the
record
where
the
batf
said
that
a
pistol
and
carbine
kit
is
not
a
short-barrel
rifle.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
the
1961
revenue
rulings
only
say
that
a
pistol
with
an
instantly
attachable
shoulder
stock
and
no
long
barrel
to
give
the
combination
a
non-nfa
purpose,
that
that's
a
short-barrel
rifle.
and
those
administrative
interpretations
are
not
very
detailed.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
i
say--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
tougher
than
justice
stevens'
facts,
because
at
least
he's
talking
about
three
parts
being
disassembled.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
here's
two,
and
it's
an
instantly
attachable
shoulder
stock.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--if
they're
right
there
together--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--and
if
it
goes
together
just
like
that
in
an
instant
like
the
revenue
rulings
in
1961,
the
answer
is
that
i
think
that's
getting
really
close
to
being
a
short-barrel
rifle,
but
again--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--that's
correct,
too.
there's
only
one
case...
these
are
all
really
difficult
issues,
but
the
zeidman
case
that's
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
gives
a
fairly
ambiguous
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
i
accept
the--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--i
would,
except
that
a
shoulder...
yes.
as
far
as
the
revenue
rulings
from
1961,
we
don't
quarrel
with
those.
the
answer's
yes.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
justice
scalia,
it's--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--i
would...
i
have
some
disagreements
with
them
on
due
process
notice
questions
for
those
reasons,
but
they're
very
distinguishable
from
this
case.
they're
not
even
close
to
the
case
we're
dealing
with
here.
those
are
instantly
attachable
shoulder
stocks,
and
the
only
purpose
of
them
is
to
make
short-barrel
rifles,
so
at
least
you've
got
a
little
bit
more
in
the
statute
than
you
have
here.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
i
would
concur
with
that,
that
the
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
the
design
part
of
the
definition...
the
design
is
the
manufacturer's
purpose,
really,
and--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--the
intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder
part
of
rifle...
the
definition
of
rifle,
and
we
say
it's
exactly
what
it
says,
a
requirement
that
the
government
prove
that
the
item
is
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
so
that,
for
example,
if
here
the
only
thing
that's
ever
being
made
is
a
long-barrel
rifle,
21-inch
barrel,
and
a
pistol
with
a
10-inch...
i'm
sorry,
the
rifle
has
a
21-inch
barrel,
the
pistol
has
a
10-inch
barrel...
that's
the
way
those
parts
are
intended
to
be
used.
as
i
see
it,
the
government
has
three
hurdles
in
the
statutory
definition:
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
it's
got
to
be
a
weapon,
not
a
pile
of
parts...
it's
got
to
be
operable
as
a
weapon...
and
the
make
requirement,
or
the
made
requirement.
so
we
don't
feel
like
they
have
any
of
those
here,
and
some
of
these
really
hard
examples
that
justice
stevens
and
justice
white
have
been
mentioning,
you're
getting
closer.
you
still
really
don't
have
all
of
those
elements
met,
i
don't
think,
but
you've
got
the
intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder
part
of
the
definition.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
you
do.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
and
also
the
strong
factual
difference,
too,
though.
here,
to
put
the
shoulder
stock
on
you've
got
to
have
the
work
space,
you've
got
to
have
several
different
tools,
and
it
takes
5
to
10
minutes.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
right.
that
applies
to
the
contender--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--well,
i
think
the
instant
attachability
at
least
is
a
factor,
the
fact
that
it's
designed
and
intended
to
be
done.
and
that's
not
the
case
here,
because
here
we're
dealing
with
items
that
are
intended
to
be
made
only
as
a
pistol
or
a
long-barreled
rifle.
so
there's
a
lot
of
metaphysical
issues
about
the
application
of
law
to
facts,
but
i
think
that,
as
applied
to
this
product,
it's
clear
enough
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply.
just
another
comment
about
the
deference
rule,
because
we
were
talking
about
the
fact
that
during
the
period
1971
through
1985
the
government
said
that
the
products
here
are
not...
the
types
of
products
here
are
not
encompassed
in
the
national
firearms
act.
this
court
has
held
numerous
times
that
you
would
owe
more
deference
to
a
ruling
that
was
set
forth
right
after
a
statute
passes
than
you
would
one
made
up
by
an
agency
decades
later.
and
we
feel
like
that's
what
happened
here.
in
1985,
for
the
first
time
as
we
can
determine,
the
agency
held
that
a
pistol
and
carbine
kit
is
a
regulated
nfa
firearm,
even
though
it
had
held
numerous
times
before
that
those
items
do
not
constitute
an
nfa
firearm.
i
would
also
point
out
in
my
remaining
time
that
the
statutory
definitions...
we've
talked
a
little
bit
about
the
contrasting
definition
of
machine
gun,
for
example,
from
a
rifle.
there
are
also
two
other
terms
in
the
statute
that
are
defined
in
terms
of
combinations
of
parts,
but
only
if
intent
is
present,
and
again
that
goes
against
the
government's
theory
here
that
there's
some
kind
of
absolute
liability
combination
of
parts
definition
with
no
intent
that
applies
to
every
nfa
firearm.
specifically,
the
term
destructive
device,
for
example,
is
defined
as
a
combination
of
parts,
as
long
as
those
parts
are
designed
or
intended
to
be
assembled
into
a
destructive
device,
and
that's...
congress
recognizes
there's
parts
that
can
go
together
in
legitimate
ways,
as
well
as
ways
that
would
be,
let's
say,
taxable
under
the
national
firearms
act.
with
the
government's
theory
of
this
case
about
a
strict
liability
combination
of
parts,
we
would
all
have
destructive
devices
in
our
homes
because
destructive
device,
for
example,
was
defined
to
include
a
bomb,
and
that
includes
a
molotov
cocktail,
which
is
made
out
of
a
bottle,
a
rag,
and
gasoline.
those
are
parts
that
we
all
have,
or
objects
that
we
all
have
in
our
households.
so
to
avoid
results
like
that
congress
has
fashioned
really
three
kinds
of
definitions
in
the
national
firearms
act.
one
of
those
definitions
is
the
one
that
the
government
argues
for
here
today
as
to
all
nfa
arms,
but
it
really
only
applies
to
machine
guns.
capability
is
the
only
test
in
that
definition,
whether
the
parts
can
be
assembled
to
a
machine
gun.
then
there's
the
two
nfa
firearms
that
are
defined
only
in
terms
of
combinations
of
parts
as
long
as
intent
and/or
design
are
shown,
and
that's
the
destructive
device
example,
or
the
silencer.
and
lastly
would
be,
for
example,
a
rifle,
which
is
not
defined
in
terms
of
a
combination
of
parts,
with
or
without
intent.
it's
defined
solely
as
a
weapon
that
has
actually
been
made
and
that
is
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder
and
that
actually
has
to
have
a
barrel
of
less
than
16
inches.
so,
when
you
look
at
the
particularized
definitions
in
each
case
here,
congress
has
not
left
these
definitions
wide
open.
it's
repeatedly
amended
the
national
firearms
act,
probably
a
dozen
times,
and
it's
consistently
refrained
from
defining
rifle
in
a
very
broad
way,
consistently
refrained
from
adopting
combinations
of
parts
definitions.
so
it's
clear
enough
that
if
it
wanted
to
adopt
a
definition
that
the
government
contends
for
here,
that
it
could
do
so,
but
it
hasn't.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
they
would
be
sold
assembled,
normally.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
assembled.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
yes,
justice
stevens.
there
may
be
certain
types
of
firearms
that
would
have
a
barrel
off
of
it
that
goes
on...
like
a
shotgun
perhaps
might
be
sold
that
way,
but
normally
firearms
are
assembled,
particularly
when
you
consider
that
there's
lots
of
little
parts
and
the
consumer
would
not
be
able
to
put
those
together.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
well,
it's
not
in
the
record,
but--
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
--a...
perhaps
i
shouldn't
answer.
mr.
stephen
p.
halbrook
oh,
if
i
may
answer,
a
shotgun
sometimes
would
be
sold
with
the
barrel
disattached
for
shipment
because
it...
to
make
it
not
so
long.
but
in
any
event,
this
issue
boils
down
to
whether
the
consumer
has
to
have
two
receivers
or
one
receiver.
the
government
concedes
that
the
complete
pistol,
the
complete
carbine,
is
not
a
short-barrel
rifle.
nothing
in
the
statute
says...
or
makes
this
distinction
about
one
versus
two
receivers,
but
this
presents
a
much
more
serious
problem
by
the
fact
that
a
hunter
or
target
shooter
or
any
other
person
who
may
presently
have
a
pistol
and
carbine
kit
made
by
another
company,
whether
he's
liable
for
10
years'
incarceration
because
he
didn't
know
that
the
government
insists
on
two
receivers
instead
of
just
one
receiver.
so
we
feel
like
that's
what
this
case
boils
down
to.
we
feel
like
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
followed
the
statutory
definitions
carefully
and
correctly
decided
this
case,
and
we
believe
it
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
