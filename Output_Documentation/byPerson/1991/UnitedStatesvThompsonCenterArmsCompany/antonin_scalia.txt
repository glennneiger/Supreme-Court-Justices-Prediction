justice
scalia
what
the
other
side
says
is
yes,
somebody
could
attach
the
stock
to
the
pistol,
but
that's
not
what
it's
sold
for.
nobody
wants
to
shoot
a
pistol
with
a
shoulder
piece.
somebody
could
saw
off
a
rifle
in
less
than
5
minutes,
too...
saw
the
barrel
down...
so
why
doesn't
that
come
under
the
act?
justice
scalia
why
would
you
want
a
shoulder-fired
pistol?
i
can't
understand
that.
i
can
understand
why
you
would
want
to
saw
off
a
powerful
weapon
like
a
rifle
so
you
can
carry
it
more
easily
and
commit
a
crime
with
it,
but
why
would
you
want
to
fit
a
shoulder
piece
to
a
pistol?
justice
scalia
than
a
pistol,
that's
right.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
so
this
one
would
be
no
more
accurate
than
a
pistol,
i
assume...
the
barrel
is
not
any
longer...
but
less
concealable
than
a
pistol.
justice
scalia
but
mr.
feldman,
are
there
criminal
penalties
for
possessing...
i
mean,
this
is...
as
it
comes
before
us
it's
a
tax
case,
but
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
same
provisions,
the
same
definitions
govern
criminal
liability
for
possession
of
this
thing?
justice
scalia
and
don't
we
usually
apply
a
rule
of
lenity
to
criminal
cases?
justice
scalia
and
do
you
concede
it
has
to
be
interpreted
the
same
way
for
both?
justice
scalia
may
or
may
not?
what's
the
position
of
the
government?
is
there
an
intent
requirement?
justice
scalia
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
scalia
right.
so
that
if
we
agree
with
the
government
we're
going
to
be
interpreting
this
provision,
which
is
at
least
ambiguous,
in
a
manner
that's
going
to
make
a
crime
what
persons
might
readily
think
is
not
a
crime.
justice
scalia
although
you
deny
that.
justice
scalia
it
may.
it
may
if
you
lose.
justice
scalia
the
same
horrible
exists
as
long
as
the
parts
are
interchangeable,
whether
they
sell
them
that
way
or
not.
criminals
who
want
to
do
that
can
do
it
even
under
your
interpretation.
all
they
have
to
do
is
buy
the
barrels
and
the
stocks
and
the...
what
do
you
call
the
part
in
the
middle,
the
receiver?
justice
scalia
the
receivers
separately.
i
mean,
that
horrible
exists
under
any
interpretation
of
this
law.
justice
scalia
mr.
feldman,
i
didn't
understand...
i
didn't
understand
the
position
you
were
taking
to
be
in
accord
with
the
answer
you
just
gave.
i
had
assumed
that
if
the
retailer
of
a
gun,
if
he
should
sell
in
one
package
a
pistol
which
is
disassembled
but
it's
in
a
box...
it's
in
a
separate
box
wrapped
in
ribbon
and
everything,
and
then
he
sells
in
another
box
a
disassembled
rifle
with
the
interchangeable
parts,
but
in
a
separate
box
and
tied
with
a
ribbon,
is
that
a
violation
because
he's
making
the
sale
of
the
two
simultaneously?
justice
scalia
yes,
right.
justice
scalia
to
the
same
customer.
justice
scalia
i
see.
okay,
so
he
sells
one...
he
sells
the
pistol,
and
then
the
customer
says
i'd
also
like
to
buy
a
rifle,
and
he
sells
the
rifle.
justice
scalia
unless
it's
a
full...
fully
assembled
pistol
and
a
fully
assembled
rifle,
then
it
doesn't
matter.
so
the
store
owner
could
say
well,
let
me
put
this
together
for
you,
and
he
puts
it
together,
and
he
puts
the
gun
together,
and
he
says
now
you
can
buy
both.
is
that...
that's
what
the
law
is.
justice
scalia
what's
rim
fire?
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
term.
what
is
that?
justice
scalia
i
see.
the
pin
goes
through,
yes.
justice
scalia
and
it
would
create
some
problems
if
they
constitute
an
impermissible
firearm
assembled
or
disassembled
but
do
not
constitute
it
assembled,
because
as
you
say,
there
are
possession
laws
as
well,
and
every
time
the
owner
who
buys
these
things
assembled,
which
wouldn't
be
a
violation,
when
he
takes
the
two
apart
to
clean
them
he
is
suddenly
in
possession
of
an
unlawful
firearm.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
not
just
the
purchases
of
the
past
kits,
it's
any
purchasers
in
the
future
who
happened
to
purchase
the
rifle
separately
and
then
the
pistol
separately
and
then
disassembled
them.
justice
scalia
justice...
well,
how
would
you
address
justice
stevens'
problem,
though?
it
really
is
a
cause
of
no
concern
with
respect
to
this
firearm,
but
i
can
conceive
of
another
firearm
that
indeed
it
is
an
easy
means
of
evading
the
statute
to
simply
sell
interchangeable
parts
like
this.
what
would
you
say,
that
congress
should
just
pass
a
law
that
would
enable
these
to
be
addressed
by
the
regulating
agency
weapon
by
weapon?
justice
scalia
our
problems
are
your
problems.
justice
scalia
mr.
white...
justice
white
keeps
pulling
you
back
onto
the
wagon,
you
keep
falling
off
again.
[laughter]
i
don't
see
how
you
can
accept
those
revenue
rulings
if
you
believe
in
your
position.
justice
scalia
you
mean
you
don't
want
to
attack
them.
you're
not
interested
in
knocking
them
down,
but
you
really
disagree
with
them,
don't
you?
justice
scalia
you'd
have
to
have...
you'd
have
to
use
a
different
theory
than
the
one
you're
using.
it
wouldn't
be
the
unassembled
theory,
it
would
be
intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder
theory.
