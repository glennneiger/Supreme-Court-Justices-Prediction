justice
souter
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
in
that
case
there's
only
one
thing
they
would
do
with
them
if
they
did
anything
at
all,
whereas
that
is
not
true
here.
justice
souter
well,
mr.
feldman,
let
me,
if
i
may,
raise...
that
raises
a
definitional
question.
you
mention
in
your
brief
that
the
definition
of
machine
gun
includes
a
reference
to
the
unassembled
parts.
is
my
recollection
correct?
justice
souter
and
you
said
it
was
not
significant
that
the
definition
of
rifle
did
not
have
any
reference
to
unassembled
parts
simply
because
what
congress
was
doing
when
it
included
the
unassembled
parts
within
the
meaning
of
machine
gun
was
codifying
prior
judicial
decisions
and
that's
all
it
was
doing.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
why,
then,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
they
were
codifying,
and
to
the
extent
that
in
your
view
the
definition
of
rifle
should
include
the
unassembled
possibilities
anyway,
why
didn't
they
also
overhaul
the
definition
of
rifle
to
make
it
very
clear
that
your
view
was
correct?
justice
souter
but
what
we're
left
with
are
two
definitions,
and
i
think
one
literally
follows
the
other,
doesn't
it,
in
which
the
machine
gun
definition
does
refer
to
the
unassembled
parts
and
the
rifle
definition
does
not.
justice
souter
anyone
looking
at
that
would
say
well,
they
can't
mean
that
the
unassembled
components
of
a
rifle,
including
possibly
a
short
barrel,
would
be
a
rifle.
justice
souter
but
isn't
that
so?
wouldn't
anyone
reasonably
contrasting
those
two
definitions
find
that
significance
in
the
contrast?
justice
souter
well,
it
might
be
misleading,
but
isn't
that
the
way
that
probably
a
person
hitting
the
statute
cold
would
read
it?
justice
souter
mr.
halbrook,
may
i
go
back
to
one
of
the
hypos
that
i
think
justice
stevens
referred
to,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
your
answer.
if
i
recall
correctly,
he
said
if
we
adopt
your
position
here,
don't
we
have
to
hold
that
the
unassembled
parts
of
the
uzi
are
also
not
covered
by
the
statute?
you
didn't
mean
to
concede,
did
you,
that
they
would
not
be
covered
by
the
definition
of
machine
gun--
justice
souter
--because
machine
gun
includes...
specifically
includes
reference
to
unassembled
parts.
justice
souter
no,
but
isn't
the...
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
isn't
the
simple
answer
that
machine
guns
are
defined
in
the
statute
to
include
unassembled
parts,
and
isn't
that
the
most
immediate
answer
to
the
problem
that
justice
stevens--
--no,
it's
not,
because
my
problem
didn't...
was
talking
about
a
single
shot.
not
asking
about
my
hypothetical--
--well,
but
the
question--
--my
problem
was
talking
about
a
single
shot
weapon
that
was
sold
disassembled.
i
think
we
would
proceed
better
if
we
all
addressed
our
questions
to
counsel,
let
counsel
respond,
and
then
take
our
turn.
would
you
answer
justice
souter's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
first
of
the
two
cases
is
united
states
v.
thompson/center
arms,
no.
91-164.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
respondent,
thompson/center
arms,
manufactures
a
pistol
called
the
contender
and
for
a
brief
period
also
manufactured
a
kit
that
could
be
used
to
convert
the
pistol
either
to
a
carbine
riffle
with
a
21-inch
barrel
or
if
the
pistol
barrel
was
left
on
to
a
short-barreled
riffle
with
a
10-inch
barrel.
unlike
the
pistol
or
the
longer
riffle,
a
sp-called
short-barreled
riffle
is
regulated
under
the
national
firearms
act
with
the
consequence
that
making
such
riffle
is
a
taxable
act.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
circuits
about
whether
a
short-barreled
riffle
actually
must
be
assembled
in
order
to
be
made
and,
hence,
for
that
act
to
be
taxable
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o'connor
join,
we
conclude
that
it
need
not
be
assembled
and
that
some
disassembled
aggregations
of
parts
are
included
in
congress'
definition.
we
conclude
that
an
aggregation
of
parts
that
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
except
the
assembly
of
a
regulated
firearm
would
constitute
the
making
of
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
we
find
congress'
language
ambiguous
however,
as
to
those
aggregations
of
parts
that
would
have
utility
in
permitting
to
assemble
of
unregulated
firearms
as
in
the
case
before
us.
although
the
case
arises
in
a
civil
setting,
the
statute
has
criminal
consequences
and
we,
therefore,
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
conclude
that
in
packaging,
the
pistol
and
conversion
kit
together,
thompson/center
had
not
made
a
short-barreled
riffle
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
and
kennedy
join;
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
