well,
what
if
you
sold
it
together
with
a
saw?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
person
manufactured
and
sold
an
assembled
rifle
and
an
assembled
pistol
and
they
were
interchangeable
in
their
parts
so
that
it
could...
theoretically
these
things
could
be
broken
apart
and
reassembled
as
a
short-barreled
rifle?
justice
o'connor
well,
so
what's
the
answer?
justice
o'connor
but
that's
not
perhaps
logical
in
light
of
your
legal
argument
here
today,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
is
there
an
intent
requirement
under
this
statute?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
have
to
have
an
intent
as
to
barrel
length,
that
it
be
a
short-barreled--
justice
o'connor
but
if
you
had
an
assembled
rifle
and
an
assembled
pistol
which
could
be
disassembled
and
reassembled
into
a
short-barreled
rifle,
you
say
no
violation.
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
say
is
the
intent
requirement
under
the
statute?
