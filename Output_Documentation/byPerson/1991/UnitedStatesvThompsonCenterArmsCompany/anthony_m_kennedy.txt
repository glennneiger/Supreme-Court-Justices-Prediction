justice
kennedy
at
what
point
does
the
manufacturer
pay
the
tax?
when
it
puts
the
component...
or
the
parts
in
a
separate
package,
or
when
they
come
off
the
assembly
line?
justice
kennedy
well,
does
that
mean
when
it
puts
it
in
its
storehouse
ready
for
shipment?
justice
kennedy
so
that
when
the
barrel
comes
off
one
assembly
line
and
the
stock
off
another
assembly
line,
there's
no
tax,
but
then
they
owe
you
the
tax
when
they
put
the
two
together
in
a
box?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
under
your
theory
if
they
have
an
inventory
with
any
number
of
stocks
and
any
number
of
barrels
at
some
point
i
suppose
that
they've
got
the
potential
of
assembling
a
weapon--
justice
kennedy
--for
which
the
tax
is
required.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
this
kit
is
shipped
as
a
complete
rifle.
there's
a
receiver.
there's
the
stock
and
the
barrel
and
the
receiver,
but
all
disassembled.
what--
justice
kennedy
--so
it's
only
the
omission
of
the
receiver
that
is
the
incident
that
requires
the
payment
of
the
tax?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
tax
them
now
for
having
the
kit,
and
the
kit
has
the
barrel
and
the
stock.
justice
kennedy
well,
what...
the
kit
now
contains
a
barrel
and
a
stock,
correct?
a
16-inch
barrel
and
a
stock,
isn't
that
correct,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
kennedy
well,
are
the
kit
and
the
pistol
sold
together?
justice
kennedy
and
suppose
they
sold
those
three
parts
disassembled.
what
result?
justice
kennedy
no,
no.
no,
it's
a
long
barrel,
it's
a
16-inch,
and
it's
a
stock,
and
it's
a
receiver,
all
dissembled,
but
they're
capable
of
being
purchased
by
someone
who
already
owns
one
of
these
pistols
and
being
converted
in
a
prohibited
way.
justice
kennedy
so
it's
only
the
absence
of
the
receiver
that
makes
it
an
illegal
kit.
justice
kennedy
all
right,
then
let
me
ask
a
different
way,
and
i
guess
if
you
have
the
disassembled
pistol,
all
of
the
parts,
and
the
disassembled
rifle,
all
of
the
parts,
and
you
sell
them
as
two
weapons,
that's
a
violation
in
your
view.
justice
kennedy
all
of
the
parts
for
each
and
they're
sold
together.
justice
kennedy
well,
you...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
at
the
outset
you
said
that
intent
is
not
a
requirement
but
that
keeps
creeping
back
into
the
argument,
or
am
i
mistaken?
is
intent
a
component
of
your
argument?
justice
kennedy
yes,
except
that
with
reference
to
every
example
you
insert
the
word
intent.
knowledge.
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
to
change
the
receiver
in
order
to
do
that?
justice
kennedy
i
want
you
to
get
to
this
part
of
the
argument,
but
i
thought
that
if
you
had
two
receivers...
the
government
responded
to
our
questions
that
there
would
still
be
liability
if
they
were
disassembled.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
that's
what
i
want
to
make
very
clear.
now,
you
said
the
agency
took
this
position--
justice
kennedy
--in
1943?
justice
kennedy
when
did
the
agency
take
this
position?
justice
kennedy
so
your
understanding
of
the
case
is
that
it
is
the
absence
of
the
receiver
that
causes...
in
the
kit
that
causes
the
problem
here.
