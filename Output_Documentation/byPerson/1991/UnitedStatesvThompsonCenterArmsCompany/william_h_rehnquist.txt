chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
91-164,
united
states
against
thompson/center
arms
company.
mr.
feldman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
you
can
make
the
short-barreled
rifle
out
of
everything
that
comes
in
that
kit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
makes
it
into
a
potential
rifle.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
haven't
some
of
our
cases
held
in
the
field
of
taxation
that
even
though
we're
dealing
with
a
tax
case
here,
if
there
are
criminal
penalties
then
you
apply
the
rule
of
lenity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
don't...
aren't
you
going
to
have
to
interpret
it
the
same
way
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
why
do
you
say
those
concerns
aren't
present
here?
they're
not
present
in
this
particular
case,
but
we're
giving
meaning
to
language
which
could
ultimately
be
applied
in
a
criminal
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
deal
with
the
gould
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
gould
or
gold,
g-o-u-l-d
v.
gould,
decided
in
19...
1970,
about...
saying
that
statutes
levying
taxes
establish
a
rule
not
to
extend
their
provisions
by
implication.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
not
extending
it
by
implication.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
receiver--
--suppose
it
included...
excuse
me.
well,
what
is
a
receiver,
mr.
feldman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
have
three
parts
to
a
rifle,
a
stock,
a
receiver,
and
a
barrel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
halbrook,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
[laughter]
you're
supposed
to
help
us
out
of
our
dilemma
by...
you
know,
if
you're
asked
a
question
that
calls
for
a
yes
or
no
answer,
it's
surely
preferable
to
say
yes
or
no
and
then
qualify,
rather
than
just
say...
you
know,
shrug
your
shoulders,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
mr.
feldman
says
that
the
administrative
constructions
go
back
to
1961,
i
think,
that
support
the
government's
view.
how
do
you
deal
with
the
administrative
constructions
that
he's
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
halbrook.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
