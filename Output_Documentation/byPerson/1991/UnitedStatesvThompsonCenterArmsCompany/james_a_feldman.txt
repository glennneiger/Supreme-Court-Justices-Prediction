mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
a
suit
for
a
refund
of
the
tax
on
the
making
of
a
firearm,
in
this
case
a
short-barrel
rifle,
by
the
respondent
thompson/center
arms
company.
it
raises
the
question
whether
manufacture
of
a
complete
but
partially
unassembled
short-barrel
rifle
constitutes
the
making
of
a
firearm
under
the
national
firearms
act.
now,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
complex.
respondent
segregated
as
a
unit...
those
are
the
terms
that
respondent
used
in
its
application
to
pay
the
tax...
segregated
in
a
unit
all
of
the
parts
that
are
necessary
to
constitute
a
short-barrel
rifle.
in
particular,
that
included
a
pistol,
which
is
not
itself
a
firearm
under
the
act,
and
a
shoulder
stock
that
converts
the
pistol
to
one
that
can
be
fired
from
the
shoulder.
now,
the
facts
that
were
found
by
the
claims
court
and
are
undisputed
are
that
the
shoulder
stock
can
fit
onto
the
pistol
in
less
than
5
minutes.
it's
easily
attachable.
therefore,
a
short-barrel
rifle
can
be
finally
assembled
merely
by
attaching
the
shoulder
stock
in
an
operation
that
takes
less
than
5
minutes.
now,
the
system--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
the
kit
consists
of
a
pistol...
now,
that
itself
is
not
a
short-barrel
rifle
because
it's
designed
to
be
fired
from
the
hand.
but
also
in
the
kit
are
essentially
three
additional
pieces,
a
shoulder
stock,
and
that
attaches
by
taking
off
the
pistol
grip
and
attaching--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
makes
it
into
a
weapon
that
is
designed
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
undoubtedly.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
other
pieces
are
a
longer
barrel
that
can
be
substituted
for
the
shorter
barrel,
and
a
fore-end,
a
wooden
piece
that
fits
under
the
barrel.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
those
pieces...
right.
if
you
attach
all
of
the
pieces
in
the
kit
you
have
a
long-barrel
rifle,
and
a
long-barrel
rifle
is
not
itself
a
firearm
under
the
act.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
but
as
far
as
the
sawed-off
rifle
goes
i
think
there's
some
important
distinctions
between
a
readily
attachable
shoulder
stock
that
attaches
right
onto
a
pistol
and
a
sawed-off
rifle
or
shot-gun.
first,
rifles
themselves,
a
fully
assembled
rifle
or
shot-gun
is
not
a
firearm
under
the
act.
now,
for...
to
take
the
position
that
that
was
a
firearm
because
you
simply
could
saw
off
the
barrel
would
be
to
mean
essentially
that
all
rifles
and
all
shot-guns
are
firearms.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
even
if
you
sell
it
together
with
a
saw,
a
saw
is
not
itself
a
part
of
a...
it's
not
a
part
of
a
rifle.
it's
not
something
that's
designed
to
be
assembled
or
added
to
a
rifle.
it's
a
tool
that's
used.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
that's
actually
the
hardest
case
here.
i
would
say
that
the
logic
of
our
argument
suggests
that
the
statute...
and
i
think
the
statute
could
be
interpreted
such
that
that
would
be
a
firearm.
however,
i
also
think
that
in
that
case
there
would
be
an
additional
consideration,
which
is
what
you
have
is
a
complete
rifle
and
a
complete
pistol,
and
neither
of
those
are
firearms
under
the
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
current
position
that
atf
has
taken,
partly
as
a
matter
of
its
enforcement
discretion,
is
that
that
is
not
a
firearm
if
they're
complete
and
fully
assembled.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't...
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
think
it
is...
the
logic
of
our
argument
could...
under
the
logical
argument
the
statute
could
be
extended
so
far
as
to
read
that,
but
the
problem
is
there's
conflicting
lines
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
intent
is
actually
right
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
to
be
a
rifle
something
has
to
be
designed,
made,
and
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder.
i
think
it's
undisputably--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i
would
say
you
have
to
have
knowledge
as
to
barrel
length.
you
certainly
would
have
to
know,
and
it's
unquestionable
that
in
this
case
respondent
knew
what
the
barrel
length
of
its
weapon
was,
but
i
don't
think...
and
you
would
have
to
know
in
the
case
of
a
parts
kit
that
these
other
kits
could
be...
that
the
shoulder
stock
could
be
added
to
the
pistol.
you
have
to
know
that
what
you
have
is
a
short-barrel
rifle,
but
what
you...
you
don't
have
to
intend
that
it
be
a
short-barrel
rifle,
and
in
particular
if
you're
a
manufacturer
i
think
the
manufacturer...
thompson,
in
this
case...
manufacturer's
intent
is
really
entirely
irrelevant
in
the
sense...
intent
as
to
what
the
consumer
is
going
to
do.
thompson
has
designed
and
made
a
weapon
with
the
parts
easily
attachable.
it
may
or
may
not
intend
for
consumers
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
with
that,
but
that
intent
is...
it
just
doesn't...
it's
not
operative
in
this
case
so
long
as
the
parts
are
easily...
can
be
easily
assembled
and
put
together.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there's
no--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
not
aware
whether
any
sportsman--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
a...
that
a
criminal
has
used
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
mean,
essentially
the
prohibition
on
short-barrel
rifles
is
based
on
the
idea
that
a
short-barrel
rifle
is
more
accurate
than
a
rifle
and
yet
more
concealable
than...
i
mean,
more
accurate--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--than
a
pistol.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
more
concealable--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--than
a
rifle.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there's
all...
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
as
to
precisely
how
accurate
this
would
be
or
whether
someone
would
or
would
not
want
to
use
this
for
criminal--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
let
me
actually...
let
me
retract
that
yes
and
put
it
in
two
parts.
the
question
as
to
what
is
a
firearm
is
identical
under
the
tax
provisions
or
under
the
criminal
prosecution
provisions.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
question
of
what
is
a
firearm.
there
may
or
may
not
be
additional
intent
requirements
from
the
basis
of
proceeding
under
one
of
the
criminal
prohibitions
that
may
require
some
further
intent
when
there's
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
only
intent
requirement
is
that
you
know
that
it's
a
firearm,
that
that
puts
you
on--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
mean,
excuse
me,
you
know
that
it's
a
weapon.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
prove
entirely
too
much.
like
any
other
tax
statute,
like
other
regulatory
matters
where
there's
regulations
that
are
enforced
by...
or
a
regulatory
scheme
that's
enforced
by
criminal
penalties,
the
fact
that
there
are
potential
criminal
penalties
lurking
in
the
background
doesn't
mean
that
the
regulatory
scheme
should
always
be
interpreted
against
the
government.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
recall
any
that
have
specifically
dealt
with
tax
cases
and
the
rule
of
lenity.
there
are
cases
that
talk
about
where
there's
been
no
consistent
regulatory
interpretation
of
a
statute...
they're
primarily
older
cases...
but
that
have
discussed
the
fact
that
you
might
then
interpret
a
statute
so
as
to
give
fair
notice
to
the
taxpayer
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
in
this
case,
where
you're
talking
about
the
registration
by
a
manufacturer
of
firearms,
there's
no
question
that
the
manufacturer
had
sufficient
fair
notice,
and
in
any
event,
it's
not
the
kind
of
criminal...
this
is
not
the
kind
of
criminal
prosecution
where
those
fair
notice
concerns
are
most
prominent.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
again,
you
would
have
to...
you
certainly
would
have
to
interpret
what
is
a
firearm
the
same
way
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
first
of
all,
i
think
the
argument
that
we're
making
is
something
that
would
be
appropriate
in
a
criminal
case,
but
if...
where
you're
addressing
criminal
cases,
the
criminal
prohibitions...
for
instance
there's
a
criminal
prohibition
against
possessing
an
unregistered...
an
unregistered
weapon
that's
required
to
be
registered.
the
term
possessing
there,
for
instance,
may
carry
some
further
intent
requirement
that's
not
applicable
where
you're
talking
about
whether
you
have
to
pay
the
tax
and
register
the
firearm
initially.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
is
our
position
that
there's
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there's...
currently
the
courts
of
appeals...
most
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
the...
for
the
criminal...
in
a
criminal
prosecution
the
intent
requirement
is
that
you
know
that
it's
a
firearm,
that
that
puts
people
on
sufficient
notice
to
know
that
they
should
check
and
see
what
the
legal
requirements
are
with
respect
to
that
weapon
before
they
possess
a
firearm.
that's
in
the
general
sense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
gold...
excuse
me.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
two
ways.
first,
i
think
the
language
of
this...
of
the
statute
here
readily
lends
itself
to
the
interpretation
of
that
proposal.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
but
i'd
also
say
that
gould
is
a
case,
and
as
are
the
other
cases
cited
by
respondent
on
this
point,
where
there
was
no
established
administrative
construction
of
the
statute.
there
have
been
numerous
cases
where
the
court
has
dealt
with
established
administrative
construction
of
tax
statutes
and
has
deferred
to
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
you
can
trace
it
back...
there
was
originally
a
revenue
ruling
in
1954
which
applied
to
any
firearm
under
the
national
firearms
act
and
said
that...
essentially
that
whether
the
parts
are
attached
or
not,
they
still
would
constitute
a
firearm
if
they're
all
that
are
necessary
to
make
it.
there
were
two
revenue
rulings
in
1961.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical.
if
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
it's
our
position
that
that
would
be
the
same...
that
that
is
the
same
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
indeed,
if
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
statute
were
adopted,
a
criminal
or
a
gang
of
criminals,
or
anyone
in
fact,
could
amass
a
cache
of
short-barrel
rifles
or
other
nfa
weapons
simply
by
buying
them
in
a
partially
unassembled
state,
with
one
or
two
pieces
missing,
leaving
them
there
in
a
warehouse
or
storehouse
until
they're
ready
to
be
used
and
then
attaching
the
final
piece
and
going
out
and
using
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
in
that
case.
in
fact,
if
this
were...
if
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
of
the
act
were
adopted,
manufacturers
could
easily
make
weapons
that
are
far
more
sinister
than
the
particular
weapon
that
we're
talking
about
here...
weapons
that
are
semi-automatic.
they're
have
higher
caliber,
and
so
on,
that
have
some
utility
and
could
be
fired
as
a
pistol,
and
then
they
sell
them
with
a
shoulder
stock
that
you
can
just
clip
right
on
to
the
handle.
all
of
those
cases
would
be
governed
by
the
determination
here,
and
any
manufacturer
could
sell
those
and
people
could
stockpile
them,
and
they
wouldn't
be
subject
to
the...
they
wouldn't
have
to
register
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
receiver.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
but
weapons
could
be
specifically
designed
and
intended
by
the
manufacturers
to
be...
by
a
single
manufacturer
just
precisely
so
they'd
have,
for
instance,
the
maximum
criminal
utility
and
so
that
there's
a
piece
or
two
that's
missing
when
you
purchase
them
so
that
technically
they're
some
other
weapon
which
someone
may
want
to
use
for
some
other
purpose
at
that
time.
so
long
as
all
these
parts
are
segregated
as
a
unit,
which
is
what
the...
what
respondent
has
said
in
his
application
to
pay
the
tax
that
was
due
in
here,
it
is
as
much
a
firearm
as
is
a
bicycle
that
you
buy
that
has
handlebars
that
the
ultimate
consumer
has
to
attach.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
certainly
be
willing
to
go
along
with
what
respondent
put
in
its
application
to
pay
the
tax,
which
is
segregate
as
a
unit.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
well,
whenever
these
parts
are
put
together
as
a
unit
so
that
you
just
need
the
final
part
to
be...
just
need
the
final
attachment
and
you
have
a
firearm.
the
statute
itself,
the
statutory
language,
talks
about
manufacturing--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--when
they're
associated
together.
it's
the
same
thing
as
if
they
were
just
making
short-barrel
rifles.
they
wouldn't...
there's
some
point
if
you
go
far
back...
let's
say
they
were
specifically
manufacturing
short-barrel
rifles
and
nothing
else.
there's
some
point
far
enough
back
in
the
manufacturing
process
where
you
don't
yet
have
a
short-barrel
rifle
and
then
at
some
point
you
do.
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
and
when
those
parts
are
segregated
as
a
unit...
let
me
suggest
another
case,
which
is
where
what
they're
making
is
a
full
rifle
and
a
full...
and
a
pistol,
and
they're
marketing
them
entirely
separately.
it
happens
that
there
are
some
interchangeable
parts.
the
shoulder
stock
is
inter...
the
shoulder
stock
can
fit
onto
the
pistol
but
it's
maybe
not
even
their
intent
to
do
so,
or
that
anyone
should
even
know
that.
if
they're
making
them
in
the
same
building
they're
making
two
different
weapons,
and
if
neither
weapon
is
a
firearm,
then
they're
not
making
firearms.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
it
is
a
long
barrel
it's
just
a
long-barrel
rifle
and
not
a
firearm.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
the...
once
you
have
the
pistol,
or
actually
it's
the
receiver--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
it
has
the
barrel,
the
stock,
plus
a
completed
pistol.
once
you
have...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
once
you
have
the
receiver
from
the
pistol
and
the
barrel
from
the
pistol
and
the
shoulder
stock,
which
is
everything
you
need
for
a
short-barrel
rifle,
regardless
of
whether
those
three
units
are...
happen
to
be
attached
to
each
other
at
a
particular--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
that's
correct.
no...
the
kit
contains
a
pistol
with,
i
think,
a
10-inch
barrel,
then
in
addition...
it
has
a
pistol
that
has
already
a
10-inch
barrel
attached
to
it.
in
addition,
the
pistol...
the
kit
contains
a
longer
barrel
and
a
shoulder
stock.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
that...
that's
what
raises
the
issue.
had
they
just
sold
the
kit
they
wouldn't
have
a
firearm
because
it
couldn't
be
used
as
a
weapon
at
that
point.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
receiver
is
the
part
of
the
gun...
firearm
that
contains
the
mechanism
of
the
gun.
it's
the
middle
part,
the
part
that
contains
the
cartridge
and
where
the
explosion
occurs.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
yes.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that's
all...
you
really
only
have
to
look
at
those
three
parts.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
again,
if
the
barrel
were
a
short
barrel
it
would
be
a
short--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
conversion
kit...
the
kit
by
itself
that
just
contains
those
parts
wouldn't
be
a
firearm,
because--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
it's
the
presence...
i
don't
mean
to
be
quarreling
with
you
on
the
hypothetical,
but
it's
the
presence
of
the
pistol
that
makes
it
a
complete
kit.
as
soon
as
you
have
all
the
parts
in
one
kit
that
are
necessary
to
constitute
a
short-barrel
rifle
you
have
a
short-barrel
rifle.
as
with
any
other
consumer
item--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yeah.
if
you
sell...
if
you
have
a
disassembled
pistol
and
a
disassembled
rifle
and
you
sell
them
separately--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
also
be
a
violation.
that's
right--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
fact
without
more...
again,
i
think
that
that's
a
hard
case,
because
there
are
two...
really
two
lines
of
reasoning
there.
one
is
that
once
you
have
all
the
parts
that
are
necessary
to
quickly
and
easily
constitute
a
short-barrel
rifle
you
have
a
short-barrel
rifle.
under...
that
reasoning
i
think
would
suggest
that
you
would
in
that
case,
but
on
the
other
hand,
congress
did
exclude
long-barrel
rifles
as
firearms
under
the
act.
and
i
think,
at
least
we've
taken
the
position
thus
far,
that
given
that
exclusion
once
you
have
the
weapon
assembled
in
a
complete
rifle
it
is
a
long-barrel
rifle
and
you
can't
recharacterize
it
as
something
else.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
they're
both
disassembled
and
he's
making
the
simultaneous--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--sales
to
the
same
customer?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
if
there's
knowledge
that
those
parts
can
be
reassembled
as
a
short-barrel
rifle--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
would
depend
if
there's
knowledge
on
everybody's
part
that
those
parts
can
be
put
together
quickly
and
readily
as
a
short-barrel
rifle.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
if
they're
fully
assembled
without
more...
again,
if
the
store
owner
suggests
to
the
customer
i'm
going
to
put
them
together
for
you
but
these...
really
it's
the
whole
unit
and
this
really
should
be
made...
you
can
go
take
this
home,
in
fact
you
ought
to
if
you
want
to
make
a
short-barrel
rifle,
i
think
that
that
might
raise
a
different
issue.
but
at
least
without
more,
the
fact
that
you
have
two
complete
weapons,
at
least
up
to
now
we've
taken
the
position
that
that's
not
an
nfa
firearm.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
as
a
general
matter
it's
not.
there
may
be
cases
like
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i...
first
of
all
knowledge...
as
justice
white
just
mentioned,
knowledge
is
what
i
would
use,
not
intent.
it's
not
the
intent
to
manufacture
the
short-barrel
rifle.
you
do
have
to
have
knowledge.
both
thompson
would
have
to
have
it.
i
think
a
user
would
have
to
have
it
in
a
prosecution.
knowledge
that
it
can
be
readily
and
quickly
assembled
as
a
short-barrel
rifle
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
short-barrel
rifle,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
requirements
of
the
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
first
of
all,
i'm
not
sure
i
would
agree
with
your
characterization
about
anybody
in
their
right
mind.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--we
haven't
attempted
to
put
in
information
in
the
record
about
this
particular
weapon,
because
in
our
view
it's
nothing.
the
particular
weapon
at
issue--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
what
congress
thought
about
this
particular
weapon
actually
is
not
important.
the
important
point
is
that
the
same
principles
would
apply
to
a
weapon
that
was
a
semi-automatic
weapon
from
which
you
could...
with
a
much
higher
caliber
that
was
specifically
designed
to
be
operational...
most
operational
as
a
short-barrel
rifle,
but
that
could
be
used
with
a
pistol
grip
attached
instead
of
the
shoulder
stock.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that's
not
quite
right.
that's
one
of
the
things
they
were
doing.
they
were
overhauling
the
definition
to
codify
those
prior
judicial
decisions,
also
to
expand
the
definition
of
machine
gun.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they...
well,
actually
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't.
there's
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
why
they
didn't.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
when
congress
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
would
be
a
misleading
way
to
look
at
it
in
this
case.
first...
in
the
first
place--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
not
sure
that
they
would.
for
one
thing,
the
rifle
definition
is
different
from
the
machine
gun...
definition.
the
rifle
definition
itself
includes
the
word
make,
which
is
defined
to
mean
manufacture,
put
together,
alter,
or
otherwise
produce.
it's
about
as
broad
a
definition
as
you
can
get.
that
word
doesn't
occur
in
the
machine
gun
definition,
and
if
you
actually
look
at
the
statute
carefully,
congress
may
have
thought
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
tinker
with
that.
but
i
think
equally
important,
when
congress
added
those
words
to
the
machine
gun
definition
it
was
adding
a
receiver
alone
as
an
nfa
firearm,
a
receiver
of
a
machine
gun.
it
didn't
intend
to
do
that
with
respect
to
short-barrel
rifles.
it
was
also
adding
items
that
could
be
used
to
convert
a
rifle
into
a
machine
gun.
it
didn't
intend
to
do
that
with
short-barrel
rifles.
in
other
words,
it
was
overhauling
the
definition
of
machine
gun,
something...
it
did
not
intend
to
tinker
with
the
preexisting
definition
of
rifles,
which
by
consistent
administrative
practice--
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point
which
is
i
think
i
might
have
been
misleading
before,
which
is
i
said
that
our
interpretation
dates
back
to
1954.
i
intended
to
continue
that
it
goes
to
1961,
and
actually
that
specific
'54
ruling
that
i
referred
to
has
since
been
declared
obsolete,
but
the
'61
rulings
are
still
fully
in
force.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'd
like
to
just
make
a
couple
of
brief
points.
one
is,
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
administrative
construction
of
the
statute.
we
address
that
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
7
to
13.
respondent's
point
primarily
rests
on
a
bunch
of
unpublished
letters
written
by
subordinate
officials
at
batf.
even
among
those,
i
fail
to
see
any
inconsistency
except
for
one
letter
that
was
written
in
1973,
which
we
informed
him
in
1985
was
incorrect.
in
any
event,
there's
a
statute
that
says
those
unpublished
letters
are
not
to
be
relied
on
or
cited
as
precedent.
what
we
are
citing
as
precedent
for
the
established
administrative
construction
that
makes
exactly
the
kinds
of
distinctions
that
we've
been
making
here,
is
a
series
of
revenue
rulings.
again,
we
explain
those
in
our
reply
brief
at
7
to
13.
those
are
published
rulings,
and
under
the
statute
and
regulations
they
are
to
be
cited
as
precedent
and
intended
to
be
as...
a
precedent.
as
far
as
the
existence
of
combination
of
parts
language
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
machine
guns
and
some
of
the
other
devices,
these...
every...
it
is
true
that
what
respondent
has
argued,
which
is
that
each
of
these
attempts
to
modify
the
national
firearms
act
have
been...
involved
hard-fought
compromises.
the
fact
that
congress
overhauled
the
machine
gun
definition
in
1968
and
added
an
entirely
new
definition
of
destructive
devices
which
was
not
there
before
and
in
the
course
of
those
two
things
specified
exactly
what
kinds
of
combinations
of
parts
and
in
the
case
of
machine
guns
what
other
individual
parts
not
in
combination
were
included
and
were
not,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
read
from
that
that
they
intended
to
restrict
or
modify
the...
what,
from
established
administrative
and
judicial
construction,
the
meaning
of
the
statute
had
been
prior
to
that
time.
i
just...
it's
not
a
case...
it's
really
a
case
of
trying
to
infer
something
from
congressional
silence,
and
i
think
that's
an
extremely
perilous
course,
and
i
wouldn't
infer
what
respondent
infers
from
it
in
this
case.
finally,
i
think
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
is...
does
not
have
to
do
with
respondent's
specific
weapon,
but
the
fact
is
that
many...
that
there
are
other
firearms
that
are
sold,
he
has
mentioned,
with
the
barrel
detached,
with
the
bolt
detached,
is
very
common
in
the
case
of
rifles.
the
mere
fact
that
a
part
or
two
is
missing...
it
has
to
be
assembled
by
the
ultimate
consumer
with
respect
to
a
rifle,
just
as
with
respect
to
a
bicycle
or
some
other
form
of
consumer
good,
the
fact
that
a
single
piece
has
to...
or
couple
of
pieces
are
missing
that
are
easily
attachable
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
the
manufacturer
who
has
made
that
consumer
good.
it's
the
manufacturer
who
makes
the
consumer
goods
and
the
consumer
who
puts
the
final
assembly
together
or
adds
the
additional
piece
or
adds
a
battery
to
a
radio
or
whatever
it
may
be.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
