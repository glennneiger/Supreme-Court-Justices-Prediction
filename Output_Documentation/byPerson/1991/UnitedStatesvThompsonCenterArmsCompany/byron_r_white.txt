justice
white
what
are
the
other
pieces?
justice
white
and
that
wouldn't
be
covered,
either.
justice
white
--the
record
certainly
doesn't
indicate
that
anybody...
any...
has
anybody
ever
used
this
contraption,
if
i
may
call
it,
as
a
short-barreled
rifle?
justice
white
has
any
sportsman
ever
used
it
that
way?
justice
white
has
any
criminal
ever
used
it
that
way?
justice
white
well,
has
this
always
been
the
government's
position--
justice
white
--the
one
that
you're
now--
justice
white
--so
you
don't
think
this
is
any
different
than
if
the
only
thing
that
was
sold
here
was
a
kit
with
a
stock
and
a
rifle
barrel...
i
mean,
a
short
rifle
barrel?
it
wasn't
assembled,
but
it
was...
could
be
readily
assembled.
justice
white
let's
assume
that
it
had
a
stock
and
it
had
a
short
barrel,
and
whatever
else
that
it
would...
necessary
to
make
a
short-barreled
rifle.
justice
white
that
is
the
same
case,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
mr.
feldman,
we
are...
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
which
means
what
did
congress
mean
by
these
words,
and
don't
you
think
it's
relevant
in
inquiring
about
what
congress
intended
to
cover?
isn't
it
relevant
that
hardly
anybody
in
his
right
mind
would
ever
anticipate
that
this
kit
would
ever
be
used
to
assemble
and
use
a
short-barreled
rifle.
justice
white
well,
i
asked
you
awhile
ago,
the
record...
you
have
no
record
of
anybody
ever
using
this
kit
to
make
a
short-barreled
rifle.
that's
because...
and
especially
you
would
think
it
was
such
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
you
would...
some...
even
a
dumb
criminal
would
have
used
it--
justice
white
--for
this
purpose,
but
no
one
in
history
has
ever
used
it
for
that
purpose.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
i
just
asked
you
isn't
it
relevant
to
what
congress
might
have
intended
to...
if
hardly
anybody
in
his
right
mind
would
have
thought
this
would
ever
be
used
as
a
short-barreled
rifle?
justice
white
you
said
awhile
ago
that
construction
of
the
statute
would
mean
that
this
is
not
a
rifle,
short-barreled
rifle,
until
it's
assembled.
that's
what
you
answered
before.
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
so
it
would
not
be
a
rifle
as
long
as
it's
sold
in
three
parts;
isn't
that
right?
that's
what
you
said
before.
justice
white
yes,
that's
what
you...
exactly
you
said
before.
it's
just
what
justice
white
thinks
you
should
answer.
[laughter]
justice
white
but
you
say
that's
wrong,
don't
you?
justice
white
you
just
said
a
minute
ago--
justice
white
--here's
two.
justice
white
exactly,
but
under
your
theory
i
would
suppose
that
is
not
a...
that
is
not
covered
by
the
statute,
because
it
isn't
assembled.
justice
white
yes
or
no?
justice
white
not
assembled.
they're
in
a
kit,
and
the
kit's
wrapped
up
in
cellophane.
justice
white
well,
close...
you
know,
in
some
contexts
close
isn't
enough.
justice
white
do
you
accept
that...
those
revenue
rulings
or
not?
justice
white
as
applied
to
exactly
what
they
applied
to.
