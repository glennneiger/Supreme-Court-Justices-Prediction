justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
intended
to
ask
your
opponent
but
just
didn't
get
a
chance
to
get
in?
what
is
the
caliber
of
this
weapon?
justice
stevens
it's
just
a
22.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
that
regard?
supposing
they
sold
a
kit
consisting
of
a
receiver,
a
short
barrel,
and
a
shoulder
stock...
just
those
three
items...
disassembled,
is
that
a
firearm
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
a
manufacturer
doesn't
want
to
take
a
lot
of
chances.
my
question
is,
would
the
statute
define
what
i've
described
as
a
rifle?
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--you'd
say
that
would
be
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
then,
why--
justice
stevens
--why
does
it
stop
being
a
rifle
because
they
put
a
fourth
item
into
the
package?
justice
stevens
well,
i
assume
it's
never
been
put
together
before.
it's
not
been
made
before.
they
just
sell
these
three
parts
in
one
kit.
how
can
the
statute
cover
that
under
your
reading
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
i
understand
you're
saying,
well,
it's
past
practice
and
we're
willing
to
go
along
with
it
as
sort
of
an
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
if
we
just
look
at
plain
language,
it
seems
to
me
if
we
adopt
your
view
of
the
plain
language,
that
kit
is
not
a
firearm.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
applies
equally
to
my
hypothetical,
that's
what
i'm
saying
to
you.
and
the
fact
that
the...
in
practice...
apparently
this
company
is
not
making
criminal
weapons.
nobody
really
has
that
flavor
of
the
case.
the
problem
in
the
case
is
if
we
adopt
your
view
of
the
statute
aren't
we
permitting
weapons
of
the
kind
i
describe
to
be
sold
as
not
counted...
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
something
that
requires
sawing
off.
i'm
talking
about
three
parts
that
have
to
be
assembled
but
have
never
previously
been
assembled.
are
they,
quote,
made,
unquote,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
your
view
is
no.
justice
stevens
if
we
decide
the
case
the
way
you
ask
us
to,
i
think
we'll
have
to
say...
we'll
have
to
say
no
as
to
all
those
hypotheticals...
the
uzi
gun
and
all
the
other
things
the
government
talks
about.
justice
stevens
even
though
it's
not
yet
been
made.
justice
stevens
well,
suppose
you
put
an
instruction
in
the
assembly
i
describe
and
say
don't
fire
this
from
the
shoulder,
only
fire
it
from
the
hip.
this
is
just
to
be
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
hip,
kind
of
western
style.
justice
stevens
like
a
xxx
rifle.
justice
stevens
well,
but
then
that
takes
your
intent
out
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
me.
once
you've
got
the
shoulder
stock
in
there,
that's
enough
to
satisfy
intended
to
be
fired
from
the
shoulder,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
but
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
as
i
understand
it
have
an
intent
requirement
that
they
must
know
there's
a
violation,
that,
you
know,
it's
a
firearm
xxx,
which
the
tax
statute
doesn't
have
the
same
intent
requirement
in
it.
justice
stevens
now,
that's
not
the
answer
to
my
hypothetical.
what
is
the
answer
to
my
hypothetical?
justice
stevens
i
really
would
be
grateful
to
you,
and
i
just
tried...
i
don't
want
to
use
up
everyone
else's
time.
is
the
answer
yes
or
no
to
my
hypothetical?
justice
stevens
three
parts
sold
separately,
barrel...
short
barrel,
a
stock...
a
shoulder
stock,
and
a
receiver.
rifle
or
not?
justice
stevens
can
it
be
yes
or
no?
justice
stevens
no,
but
you
have...
the
two
out
of
three
are
met
in
the
hypotheticals.
the
intended-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder
might
not
be,
but
if
you
have
either
the
two-part
or
the
three-part
short-barreled
rifle,
assuming
when
you
put
them
together
it's
a
short-barreled
rifle,
you
have
the
same
obstacle
with
the
word
made,
and
the
same
obstacle
with
the
word
weapon.
justice
stevens
so
those
arguments
really
don't
carry
the
day
for
you,
it
seems
to
me,
unless
you're
willing
to
say
those
revenue
rulings
are
wrong,
but
you
might
well
be
right
on
the
intend-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder
because
this
can
be
used
either
way,
with
the
pistol
handle
or
with
the
shoulder
stock.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
when
you
buy
a
lot
of
christmas
toys
that
you
think
you're...
readily
assemble,
and
it
take
longer
than
that.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
i
mean,
you
can't
really
rely
on
the
difference
between
5
minutes
and
just
plugging
it
in,
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
the
typical
practice
in
the
industry
when
you
sell
long-barreled
rifles?
are
they
generally
sold
by
the
factory
to
the
dealer
in
a
disassembled...
the
shoulder
stock
in
one
part
and
the
rifle
in
another?
justice
stevens
assembled
or
disassembled?
justice
stevens
they
would
be.
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand
that,
but
i
thought
sometimes
the
barrel
might
just
be
sold...
that
there'd
be
in
two
parts.
i
thought
sales
in
two
parts
was
fairly
common,
but
i'm
wrong
about
that
i--
justice
stevens
--i
shouldn't
ask
you
about
it.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
glad
to
have
the
answer.
