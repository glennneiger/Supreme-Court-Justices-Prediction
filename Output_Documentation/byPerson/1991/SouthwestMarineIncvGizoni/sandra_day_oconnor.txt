justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
tichy,
the
plain
language
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
excludes
from
coverage
any
repairman
who
is
a
member
of
a
crew
of
any
vessel,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
just
reads
that
right
out
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can't
a
ship
repair
person
be
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel?
isn't
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
there
was
language
in
it
that
intended
to
cut
back
somewhat
on
some
of
those
odd
decisions
that
occurred
some
years
back
that
made
everything,
including
questions
of
law,
a
jury
question?
you
don't
think
there
was
an
indication
in
wilander
that
that
was
no
longer
our
view,
if
it
ever
was
the
view
of
the
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
couldn't
that
be
a
question
of
law,
and
has
this
court
ever
decided
whether
all
floating
things
in
the
water
are
vessels?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
long,
that
is
how
you
would
give
effect
to
the
mutual
exclusivity
of
the
two
acts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
is
a
question
of
law,
whether
a
vessel
is
a
vessel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
we
can
call
it
mcdermott
and
solve
the
problem
that
way.
