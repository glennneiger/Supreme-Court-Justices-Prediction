we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-584,
southwest
marine,
inc.,
v.
bryon
gizoni.
mr.
tichy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
uses
the
term
"seaman",
doesn't
it,
not
member
of
a
crew
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
the
longshore
act,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
jones
act
uses
the
term
"seaman",
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
the
term,
seaperson,
come
from
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
does,
you
should
refer
to
it
accordingly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
this
requirement
emerge,
in
the
enactment
of
the
1972
amendments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
before
that,
there
was
no
such
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say,
the
congress,
i
suppose
by
implication,
since
they
didn't
do
it
expressly,
also
established
kind
of
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
1972
amendments
or
their
legislative...
that
suggests
congress
intended
to
effect
the
traditional
jones
act
procedures,
which
you
start
in
court,
i
take
it,
in
the
jones
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was:
is
there
any
indication
in
that
legislative
history
that
congress
wanted
to
depart
from
traditional
jones
act
procedures,
where
you
could
go
directly
into
court
if
you
have
a
jones
act
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
even
if
a
claimant
is
saying,
i
don't
claim
under
that
system,
i
claim
under
the
jones
act,
the
claimant
must
still
go
through
the
administrative
procedure
for
the
harbor
workers
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tichy.
mr.
easley,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
cases
like
norton
against
warner
and
some
of
those
cases
decided
in
the
fifties
by
this
court,
where
the
court
in
effect
said
the
sky
is
the
limit
so
far
as
a
jury
finding
someone
is
a
seaman...
do
you
think
those
have
survived
in
tact
after
our
wilander
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
a
vessel
and
a
barge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
easley.
mr.
long,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
tichy,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tichy.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
