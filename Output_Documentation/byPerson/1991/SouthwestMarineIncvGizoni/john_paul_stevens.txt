justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
just
to
be
sure
i
get
something
straight
in
my
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
wins
the
jones
act
claim,
assume
you
lose,
just
for
purposes
of
argument,
will
you
be
entitled
to
a
credit
for
the
amount
paid
on
the
longshoreman
act
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
is
there
any
risk
of
double
recovery
in
this
case?
that
is
what
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you,
of
course
go
on.
it
says,
"but
does
not
include
a
master
or
member
of
the
crew
of
any
vessel.
"
so
you
are
suggesting,
i
gather,
that
a
person
could
not
be
a
ship
repairman
on
board
an
ocean
liner
or
something
like
that?
couldn't
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
exception
talks
about
people
who
are
vessels.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
vessel--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
about
a
vessel
within
the
3-mile
limit
or
within
the
harbor
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
asking
about
the
use
of
the
term,
vessel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren't
there
vessels
that
do
not
leave
the
harbor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
crew
of
such
a
vessel
is
not
a
ship
repairman
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
even
if
he
spends
all
his
time
doing
ship
repair
work.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
not
be
on
a
vessel,
even
though
the
vessel
never
left
the
harbor.
because
he
was
in
the
harbor,
even
though
he
was
on
a
floating
vessel,
he
would
not
be
on
a
vessel,
because
the
vessel
stayed
in
the
harbor.
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
hypothesis,
we
are
talking
about
someone
who
is
not
land
based.
you
are
talking
about
somebody
who
is
based
on
a
vessel
that
floats
around
in
a
harbor.
you
say
we
should
treat
him
as
though
he
were
land
based
because
of
the
term
used...
"harbor
worker".
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
maybe
we
have
got
the
wrong
case
here,
but
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides
of
the
question
of
whether
a
person
is
under
the
statute
or
under
the
jones
act?
there
must
be
some
borderline
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
are
they
to
be
resolved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
supposing
an
employee
files
a
claim
under
the
harbor
workers
act
because
he
is
not
really
sure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
employer
goes
ahead
and
acknowledges
the
claim
and
there
is
adjudication
of
the
issue,
does
that
mean
he
is
estopped
from
saying
well,
i
really
think
i
am
entitled
to
jones
act
benefits,
but
in
order
to
protect
myself,
i
filed
this
claim
as
well.
is
he
estopped
from
bringing
a
jones
act
claim?
what
is
the
employee
supposed
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
it
is
not
adjudicated.
supposing
the
employer
just
goes
ahead
and
starts--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
with
you
a
moment?
and
you
suggested
that
if
there
had
been
an
actual
adversary
adjudication
by
the
agency
in
this
case,
that
would
be
binding
on
the
employee.
are
there
cases
that
so
hold?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
means,
i
take
it,
in
cases
like
this,
the
employer
would
be
well
advised
always
to
resist
payment
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
adjudication
in
a
doubtful
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
we
are
just
talking
about
doubtful
cases,
always.
i
mean,
if
it
is
perfectly
clear,
the
lawyers
will
work
that
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
another
question
about
tactics
in
this
situation?
if
you
are
right,
would
it
not,
if
an
employer
could
afford
to
do
so,
he
would
be
better
off
generally,
in
a
doubtful
case,
to
litigate
the
jones
act
claim
first
because
that
tolls
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
other,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
be
the
normal
way
to
do
it
is
to
litigate
rather
than
filing
a
claim
and
taking
the
risk
that
you
would
get
an
adverse
adjudication.
i
would
suppose
what
he
would
want
to...
would
he
be
trying
to
prove
that
the
employee
is
a
seaman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
run
the
risk
of
an
adjudication
that
would
foreclose
their
jones
act
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
refresh
my
recollection,
because
i
don't
remember
the
case
even
as
well
as
justice
white
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
case
hold
that
you
must
go
to...
bring
your
administrative
claim
before
you
litigate
your
fela
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
that
case
held
that
they
were
covered
by
one
statute
rather
than
the
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
did
it
say
anything
about
which
proceeding
you
must
commence
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
claim
there
wasn't
arguably,
their
claim,
as
a
matter
of
law
was
within
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
