mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
land-based
maritime
employees,
specifically
included
in
the
coverage
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act,
nonetheless
are
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
trial
to
determine
their
alleged
status
as
jones
act
seamen.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
straightforward,
as
it
comes
to
this
court
after
reversal
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
a
summary
judgment
issued
by
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
respondent,
bryon
gizoni,
is
a
rigger
and
rigger
foreman
for
petitioner,
our
client,
southwest
marine.
one
day
while
working
on
a
floating
platform,
a
platform
commonly
used
for
ship
repair
work
and
devoid
of
navigational
qualities,
gizoni
was
injured
when
his
foot
went
through
a
hole
in
the
platform.
typical
of
any
ship
repair
person,
gizoni
filed
for
an
obtained
longshore
act
benefits.
in
fact,
he
obtained
in
excess
of
<eighteen
thousand
dollars
>
[
=
$
18,000]
worth
of
benefits,
which
he
then
used
as
he
went
out
forward,
not
only
to
take
care
of
his
medical
needs,
but
we
assume,
to
bring
a
jones
act
claim,
seeking
to
get
an
even
bigger
recovery
by
ignoring
the
administrative
process
and
invoking
the
full
processes
of
the
federal
court
system,
including
the
use
of
a
jury
to
determine
his
alleged
seaman
status
and
his
jones
act
claim.
what
makes
gizoni's
jones
act
claim
peculiar
and
bizarre
is
that
he
is
land
based.
he
works
strictly
in
san
diego
harbor
and,
by
stipulation,
is
a
ship
repairman.
yet
with
the
conviction
that
just
about
any
ship
repairman
can
also
make
out
a
jones
act
claim,
regardless
of
congressional
intent--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--yes,
you
certainly
can.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
there
is
no
risk
of
double
recovery.
however,
the
problem
is
that
the
right
to
have
the
offset
is
judicially
created.
it
is
not
provided
in
the
jones
act,
and
as
a
result,
unfortunately,
of
what
has
occurred
over
the
years
with
regard
to
the
ambiguity
as
to
whether
or
not
one
is
in
fact
a
jones
act
seaperson.
in
fact,
there
is
language
in
the
longshore
act,
which
is
specifically
section
3(e),
which
provides
for
a
credit
in
the
event
one
mistakenly
gets
payments
under
the
jones
act
or
some
other
state
compensation
form
of
coverage.
essentially
what
has
happened
here,
justice
stevens
and
members
of
the
court
is
this:
in
1927,
when
the
longshore
act
was
passed,
this
was
the
first
time
in
which
congress
had
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
void
which
had
been
created
in
the
law.
that
is
to
say,
to
deal
with
the
stevedores
and
longshoring
people.
and
over
the
years
what
happened
unfortunately
was
that
there
was
a
recognition
through
the
situs
test,
as
opposed
to
the
status
test
which
was
developed
in
1972,
that
essentially
what
would
happen
is
that
a
person
could
walk
in
or
out
of
coverage
under
the
jones
act.
in
fact,
this
court
stretched
to
the
ultimate
before
the
passage
of
the
longshore
act
to
try
and
bring
stevedores
within
the
jones
act,
simply
to
avoid
this
problem
of
coverage.
but
what
happened
was
the
congress
took
the
baton
and
started
roll...
running
with
it,
if
you
will,
and
determined
essentially,
that
it
would
set
forth
a
law
in
which
it
could
provide
coverage
for
those
who
were
injured
upon
navigational
waters
who
were
nonsea
people
and
additionally,
by
the
passage
of
the
1972
amendments,
in
essence,
were
able
to
cover
those
who
were
on
the
adjoining
areas.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
to
the
contrary,
justice
o'connor.
you
know,
i
wrestled
with
the
arguments
that
were
raised
by
the
solicitor,
as
well
as
by
mr.
gizoni's
counsel,
and
i
guess
the
way
that
you
have
to
deal
with
the
issue
that
you
raise
is
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
statute
and
you
look
at
the
language
which
congress
used.
congress
divided
those
who
were
maritime
employees
into
two
types,
and
the
unique
language
they
used
was
shall
be
included,
and
shall
not
be
included.
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
aristotelian
logic.
they
didn't
use
words
other
than
nonincluded.
they
said,
included
are
a,
b,
c,
and
d...
which
by
the
way,
in
this
case
includes
harbor
workers,
which
are
a
specifically
designed
category
of
maritime
employee.
and
then
congress
went
one
step
further.
congress
said,
look,
we
are
not
simply
covering
harbor
workers.
we
are
going
to
specifically
cover
those
who
are
ship
repair
persons,
and
so
they
specifically
included
that.
by
definition,
congress
having
provided
an
inclusion--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--no.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
it
goes
back
to
congressional
intent
in
this
particular
situation.
as
you
so
vividly
wrote
in
your
wilander
decision,
a
master
or
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
is
a
jones
act
seaperson.
that
is
a
specifically,
not
included
category.
what
has
happened
here
is,
and
the
issues
comes
to
you
because
of
the
confusion
in
the
courts.
what
has
happened
is--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--not
the
longshore
act.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
it
uses
a
term
"master"
or
"member"
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--your
honor,
i
suppose
that
is
my
introduction.
it
is
seaman,
your
honor.
i
recognize
the
act,
when
it
was
amended
in
1984,
however,
eliminated
the
term
"longshoreman"
and
used
the
term
"longshore
and
harbor
workers
act",
and
i
suspect
that
the
congress
very
well
may
make
that
sort
of
change--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--thank
you,
your
honor,
and
i
certainly
will.
in
any
event,
justice
o'connor,
the
term
"a
master
and
a
member
of
a
crew.
"
as
you
pointed
out
is
the
equivalent
of
a
jones
act
seaman.
and
as
such,
was
specifically
excluded
from
the
longshore
act,
but
as
the
language
was
used,
and
specifically
in
section
2(3),
the
term
employee
means
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
including
any
longshoreman
or
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
and
any
harbor
worker,
including
a
ship
repairman.
it
is
unequivocally
stipulated
in
this
particular
case,
that
mr.
gizoni
is
in
fact
a
ship
repairman.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
there
are
situations
where
an
individual
is
land
based,
which
is
the
other
pivot
in
the
wilander
decision--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--that's
right.
if
somebody
were
attached
to
a
vessel
on
the
high
seas,
out
there
as
you
will--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--for
weeks,
and
was
taking
care
of
that
vessel
out
there,
outside
the
3-mile
limit,
that
individual
would
probably
be
a
master
or
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
submit
to
you,
justice
stevens,
that
the
use
of
the
term,
harbor
worker
was
intended
to--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
indeed,
there
are
vessels
that
do
not
leave
the
harbor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it
was
the
1972
amendments
that
clarified
that
if
that
individual
worked
exclusively
within
the
harbor,
that
that
individual
would
in
fact
be
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
the
underlying--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
for
purposes
of
the
longshore
act--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--that
the
1972
amendments
made
it
clear
that
there
are
those
individuals
who
work
exclusively
within
the
harbor,
exclusively,
if
you
will,
within
the
break-water,
who
are
not
subject
to
the
type
of
perils
of
the
sea
which
a
normal
seaman
is;
therefore,
congress
used
the
term
"harbor
worker"
to
specifically
indicate
a
form
of
inclusion.
i
would
point
out
to
you,
that
is
not
the
issue
that
we
have
here
because
this
is
a
ship
repair
person
who
is
part
of
a
shipyard
who
is
repairing
something
essentially
next
to
the
shore.
but
the
use
of
the
term
"harbor
worker",
i
would
submit
to
you,
is
intended
to
necessarily
exclude
from
the
inclusion
of
a
master
or
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel,
those
people
who
work
exclusively
within
the
confines
of
a
harbor
because...
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is,
congress
created
the
longshore
act
with
the
object
of
having
a
no-fault,
uniform
system
of
compensation.
secondly,
congress
in
doing
this,
recognized
that
those
people
who
are
normally
covered
are
land
based.
those
who
work
within
the
harbor
areas--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--i
would
submit
that
that
is
in
fact
the
case,
and
i
cannot
imagine
a
situation
in
the
real
world
where
an
individual
is
assigned
to
a
vessel
that
operates
strictly
within
a
harbor
who
is
not
land
based.
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
really
is
a
pivot
in
the
wilander
decision,
the
recognition
which
the
court
came
to,
essentially,
which
was
that
if
you
are
talking
about
somebody
who
was
land
based,
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
provide
them
with
this
uniform
method
of
compensation
this
no-fault
method
of
compensation
to
avoid
multiple
awards,
to
avoid
the
multiplicity
of
litigation,
to
avoid
the
problem
that
you
alluded
to
about
the
possibility
of
inconsistent
results
or
the
necessity
to
achieve--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--sure.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
very
simply,
and
i
am
glad
you
asked
the
question.
this
court,
in
dealing
with
other
administrative
types
of
procedures,
and
in
particular,
we
cite
the
court
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
type
of
situations,
where
congress
has
established
an
administrative
agency
with
expertise
in
the
particular
area
which
is
involved,
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
is
where
someone
is
arguably
covered
by
that
administrative
act,
where
an
agency
such
as
the
owcp
has
administrative
expertise,
the
obligation
on
the
party
asserting
the
claim,
which
is
an
arguable
claim,
must
first
go
through
that
administrative
agency
before
attempting
to
burden
the
courts
in
any
manner,
shape,
or
form
with
the
type
of
litigation
which
is
involved
here.
what
you
have
here
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
type
of
result
which
i
think
was
intended--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
if
the
matter
were
adjudicated,
i
would
say
yes.
that
is,
if
there
was
a
finding
of
fact--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--voluntarily
provided
the
payments,
as
he
did
here.
and
let's
assume
the
worst-case
scenario,
the
employer
made
a
mistake
and
everybody
made
a
mistake
because
they
filed
under
the
wrong
act.
that,
under
the
hypothesis
that
i
have
submitted,
would
not
preclude
him
from
making
a
jones
act
claim.
that
is
not
the
fact
however
of
this
case.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
if
the
individual
made
a
total
error,
the
employer
made
a
total
error,
provided
the
benefits,
then
he
would
have
to
go
court,
certainly.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
do.
i
took
the
very
worst-case
scenario,
justice
white,
which
was
that
it
was
blatantly
obvious
that
it
was
a
mistake,
and
those
where
it
is
arguably
covered
by
the
longshore
act--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--that's
right--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--then
they
should
go
to
the
administrative
agency,
justice
white.
if
it
is
arguably
covered
by
the
longshore
act,
then
the
administrative
agency
with
the
administrative
expertise
should
make
that
determination
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--he
needs
to
get
a
determination
from
that
agency,
if
it
is
arguable
that
he
is
covered,
that
is
what
he
should
do.
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
the
litigation
involving
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
the
equivalent
of
it,
but
in
this
court's
garmon
decisions,
essentially
what
the
court
has
said
is,
we've
created
the
law...
congress
created
the
law
which
establishes
coverage,
and
that
particular
coverage
is
articulated
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
if
you
arguably
come
within
that,
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
have
that
administrative
agency
assume
the
burden
of
determining
coverage.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
believe
so,
because
prior
to
that--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--what
happened
was,
prior
to
'72
there
was
only
a
situs
test
and
therefore,
what
was
happening
was
that
an
individual
had
to
establish,
in
order
to
obtain
coverage,
that
he
was
not
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
that's
what
he
had
to
establish,
and
that
his
injury
occurred
upon
navigable
waters.
what
happened
in
1972
is
that
congress
established
a
status
test
and
actually
affirmatively
designed
for
the
first
time
descriptions
of
categories
of
covered
people.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
yes.
by
the
same
parallel
analysis
which
was
utilized
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
setting,
there
was,
i
would
point
out
to
you,
essentially,
the
same
type
of
approach
which
was
judicially
created,
recognition
of,
if
you
will,
the
administrative
expertise
side
of
it
and
a
recognition
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
not
to
allow
the
courts
or
create
further
burdens
for
the
courts
in
the
administration
of
justice,
and
present
to
juries,
if
you
will,
issues
for
which
other
people
had
been
specifically
trained
and
developed
the
type
of
expertise
which
is
relevant
to
the
determination
of
rights.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
specific
reference
to
your
question,
what
we
see
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
is
the
development
in
'72
of
a
status
test.
what
had
happened
historically,
looking
at
the--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--i
believe
the
answer
to
that
and
perhaps
i
am
not
stating
it
as
clearly
as
i
should,
is
by
adopting
the
status
requirement,
congress
attempted
to
delineate
those
people
who
must
absolutely
go
to
the
owcp
for
their
relief,
because
there
was
a
tradeoff.
employers
now
have
to
pay
substantially
greater
benefits
under
that
longshore
act
and
the
employees,
of
course,
get
greater
benefits
as
a
result.
and
it
is
a
no-fault
system
which
congress
created.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that's
correct,
if
he
is
a
ship
repair...
ship
repairman,
such
as
mr.
gizoni.
absolutely,
absolutely.
any
other
system
would
be
a
catastrophe
for
the
courts
as
well
as
the
administrative
agencies
because
of
the
possibility
of
inconsistency
of
results.
also,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress'
intent,
because
this
is
what
would
happen.
if
the
stevedoring
company
or
the
ship
repair
company
saw
that
they
would
have
to
face
two
types
of
litigation,
they
would
controvert
on
the
longshore
act,
instead
of
giving
the
immediate
and
speedy
payments
which
congress
intended,
because
they
would
want
a
determination
of
their
judicial
obligations
or
their
statutory
obligations
before
they
would
pay.
so
the
net
result
would
be,
if
gizoni
prevails
here,
the
very
intent
of
all
these
laws,
that
is
to
provide
benefits
to
people
who
are
injured,
would
in
fact
be
delayed.
the
beauty
of
the
longshore
act
is
they
get
the
payments
immediately.
they
get
them
when
they
have
the
need.
employers
are
encouraged
to
make
those
payments
as
quickly
and
rapidly
as
they
can
in
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
those
particular
people.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
it
would.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
except,
it
would
be
reviewable
in
the
same
way
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
determination
is
reviewable.
since
the
administrative
law
judge
would
in
fact
be
a
finder
of
fact,
that
would
be
reviewable
only
if
there
were
some...
there
were
not
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
result.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
the
case
of
somebody
who
is
specifically
enumerated
within
the
included
categories
of
2(3),
it
is
as
a
matter
of
law.
anybody
who
is
within
those
is
covered.
there
are
however
potentially
maritime
employees
who
are
not
within
the
included
categories
but
who
were
intended
for
coverage.
those
do
involve
issues
of
fact
and
to
that
extent,
a
factual
determination
may
have
to
be
made
by
the
administrative
agency.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
would
be
any
review
of
the
administrative
agency,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
factual
issues,
it
would
be
on
a
substantial
evidence
test,
as
indeed
is
the
case
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
as
to
issues
of
law,
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
court
to
determine
on
its
own.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
in
the
garmon
case,
essentially
what
happened
was
that
an
employer
sued
a
union
for
picketing,
which
was
arguably
protected
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
what
happened
was
the
state
courts
of
california
twice
said,
look,
you
make
out
a
claim.
we
are
willing
to
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say.
you
can
present
it
to
a
jury
and
you
can
get
a
determination.
what
the
supreme
court
said
was
that
you
have
set
forth
facts
which
are
arguably
within
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
gentlemen,
you
must
go
to
the
administrative
agency,
the
nlrb.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
it
just
so
happened
that
garmon
arose
in
the
context
of
a
state
action.
but
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
that
same
type--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--let
me
point
out
one
thing
if
i
may.
it
is
just
happenstance
that
garmon
arose
out
of
a
state
court
action.
you
know,
the
anheuser
busch
case,
i
believe,
arose
out
of
federal
action.
i
think
that
involved,
if
you
will,
alleged
antitrust
violations
which
were
perceived
to
be
within
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
so
the
fact
that
the
action,
just
by
happenstance,
was
brought
in
the
state
court
as
opposed
to
the
federal
court
wouldn't
any
less
make
the
national
labor
relations
act
dispositive,
and
the
same
parity
of
analysis
would
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
sure,
title
vii
of
the
eeoc.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
sure.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
if
i
can
think
of
one,
when
i
come
back
on
rebuttal,
i
will
let
you
know.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
but
the
one
most
in
line
is,
of
course,
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
guess
when
i
am
asked
a
question
i
dwell
on
it
for
some
point,
but
in
reference
to
justice
scalia's
comments,
i
can
think
of
two
parallel
situations
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
one
is
the
relationship
between
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
antitrust
laws,
and
the
second
is
justice
white's
decision
in
schwalb,
which
was
in
fact
decided
by
this
court
in
1989--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--excuse
me?
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that's
correct,
but
it
was,
your
honor,
and
you
know
the
case
much
better
than
i
ever
will--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--but
it
relates,
if
i
recall,
to
two
concurrent
forms
or
potentially
concurrent
forms
of
federal
relief.
one
was
fela
and
the
other
was
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act,
and
of
course,
in
that
case,
you
went,
i
think
to
the
extent
of
elucidating
for
those
of
us
who
practice
in
this
area,
the
extent
to
which
the
longshore
act
does
in
fact
apply,
indicating
the
integral
part
of
and
essential
characteristic
to
cover
the
individuals
who
are
involved
maintenance
at
conveyor
belt.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
okay.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
a
claim
was
attempted
to
be
made
under
fela,
and
there
was
raised
as
a
defense
that
the
longshore
act
applied.
and
it
was
ultimately
determined
by
this
court
that
indeed
the
longshore
act
applied
because
the
individuals,
who
were
essentially
maintenance
employees,
were,
if
you
will...
and
not
very
highly
paid
individuals
necessarily,
were
involved
in
picking
up
coal
around
a
conveyor
belt
that
was
used
to
load
coal
on
to
a
vessel--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--correct.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
think
implicit
in
that,
and
i
will
certainly
leave
it
to
the
justices
to
discuss
in
more
detail,
is
where
you
arguably
have
a
claim
which
is
within
the
longshore
act,
that's
where
you
should
initiate
your
proceeding,
that's
where
your
focus
should
be,
and
that's
where
you
should
go.
now
i
would
point
out
further--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
--well,
ultimately
you
determined
that.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
absolutely.
when
this
court
decided
wilander,
there
were
two
very
interesting
and
articulate
points
that
were
raised.
first
of
all,
on
page
813
of
the
decision,
justice
o'connor
stated:
thus,
it
is
odd
but
true
that
the
key
requirement
for
jones
act
coverage
now
appears
in
another
statute,
referencing
the
longshore
act.
subsequently,
on
the
top
of
page
814,
justice
o'connor
states:
whether
under
the
jones
act
or
general
maritime
law,
seaman
do
not
include
land-based
workers.
mr.
gizoni
is
a
land-based
worker.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
assume
it
is
wilander.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
worked
in
north
shipping,
sweden
for
some
time
in
my
youth.
i
am
assuming
that
it
is
pronounced
that
way.
maybe
it
is
german
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
what
i
assumed,
and
in
my
youth
many
years
ago
i
did
have
the
opportunity
to
speak
some
of
the
language,
though
not
well.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that's
right,
and
there
we
have
decided
on
the
dispositive
determination.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
okay,
thank
you
very
much,
justice
o'connor.
in
summation,
for
all
the
reasons
which
we
have
raised
before
this
court:
application
of
basic
rules
of
statutory
construction,
specifically
2(3);
implementation
of
congressional
intent,
which
of
course
is
reflected
in
the
1972
amendments;
avoidance
of
multiple
litigation;
avoidance
of
multiple
and
inconsistent
results;
maintenance
of
a
uniform,
less
expensive
and
more
certain
no-fault
compensation
system,
as
well
as
the
simplicity
of
definitional
language
and,
i
submit
to
you,
fundamental
logic,
petitioner,
southwest
marine,
requests
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
thank
you.
