justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
wouldn't
the
agency
determination,
of
course,
be
reviewable
in
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
these
things
are
going
to
be
decided
by
the
courts
eventually,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
question
of...
whether
you
are
a
seaman
under
the
statute,
is
a
question
of
fact
rather
than
law?
i
thought
that
the
reason
we
are
here
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
as
is
the
case
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
how
does
it
come
up
in
the
context
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
isn't
a
matter
of
having
to
go
to
the
administrative
agency,
not
just
a
matter
of
that.
it
is
a
matter
of
having
to
go
to
the
feds.
i
mean,
you
have
a
question
of
preemption
and
we
want
the
labor
board
to
have
the
first
determination
rather
than
what
could
be
a
state
court
for
the
violation
of
law.
that
is
a
big
difference.
in
this
case,
it
is
going
to
be
a
federal
agency
in
either
case,
either
an
administrative
agency
or
a
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
is
the
crucial
distinction.
the
issue
is
always
going
to
be
whether
state
law
is
preempted
by
federal
law,
and
i
can
see
why
there
is
strong
reason
to
have
the
labor
board
have
the
first
say
on
that.
but
here,
it
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
it
is
either
federal
maritime
law
or
it's
the
longshore
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
instance
like
this
where
the
issue
is
which
of
two
federal
schemes
would
apply
and
where
you
must
go
to
the
administrative
agency
first?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
where
it
says
so,
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
mean
where
it
doesn't
say
anything
and
where
we
have
created
a...
by
judicial
determination,
the
rule
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
administrative
agency
first.
i
am
trying
to
think
of
a
parallel--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
offhand
can't
think
of
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
it
doesn't
necessarily
recognize
that.
i
mean,
it
may
have
just
been
a
voluntary
payment,
assuming
that
the
person
was
entitled
to
them
under
the
jones
act,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
mean,
it's
a
sub...
office
of
workers'--
justice
antonin
scalia
--owcp,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
owcp
issues
a
regulation
in
addition
to
making
individualized
determinations
of
who
is
covered?
i
assume
they
are
authorized
to
issue
a
regulation
saying,
we
will
hence
forward
determine
that
this
kind
of
a
person,
and
it
gives
a
detailed
description,
is
covered
by
the
longshore
act,
okay.
then,
in
a
later
lawsuit,
somebody
seeks
to
get
jones
act
recovery,
and
seeks
to
get
to
the
jury,
in
the
face
of
this
regulation
that
the
labor
department
has
issued,
what
is
the
result?
does
that
regulation
have
no
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
we
were...
we're
entitled
to
give
the
regulation
any
deference?
unlike
other
regulations
where
if
it
is
within
the
broad
range
of
what's
reasonable,
we'll
say
it
is
okay.
this
regulation
alone
has
to
be
precisely
right?
there
is
only
one
meaning
and
we
will
give
it
that
meaning?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
unusual,
if
it
is
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
always
a
jury
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
the
facts
could
be
clear
enough
that
there
is
just
no
evidence
at
all
that
the
person
was
a
crew
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
also
would
be
taken
away
from
the
jury.
so
you
are
not
claiming
it
always
go
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens
if
the
secretary
issues
a
regulation
dealing
with
this
subject?
would
the
court
in
admiralty
ignore
it
or
what?
or
he
shouldn't
issue
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
he
issues
a
regulation,
the
courts,
in
the
jones
act
case,
would
have
to
follow
his
regulation,
even
though
he
is
issuing
it
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right,
and
then
suppose
he
doesn't
issue
a
regulation,
but
in
fact
the
claimant
goes
to
him
for
a
case
determination
initially
and
he
decides
that
the
work
is
covered.
that
worker
could
then
not
later
challenge
that
and
bring
a
jones
act--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tichy,
do
you
know
how
to
pronounce
wilander?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that
firsthand?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
ought
to
agree
with
this--
--wilander
is
a
swedish
name.
