justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
but
where
would
he
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
you...
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
the
administrative
agency
to
decide
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
is
just
close?
what
if
it
is
just
close,
and
the
employer
goes
ahead
and
pays
it.
it
isn't
adjudicated--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--then
the
employee
who
has
been
getting
benefits
because
the
employer
has
been
paying
them--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
he
now
wants
to
go
to
the
jones
act,
he
has
to
go
to
the
administrative
agency
and
say,
by
the
way,
i
am
really
not
covered
by
the
longshoremen
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
goes
up,
wants,
in
a
sense,
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
issue
would
have
to
be
there
as
to
whether
it's...
he
is
a
seaman
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
want
to
be
subject
to
a
jones
act
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
so
that
is
kind
of
a
funny
position
for
him
to
be
in,
to
go
before
the
administrative
agency.
he'd
be
trying
to
prove
something
he
really
doesn't
want
to
prove.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
court
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
court
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
even
remember
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
way
it
is
pronounced
in
the
broadcast
of
tennis
tournaments.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
of
these
is
southwest
marine
incorporated
against
gizoni.
it
is
no.
90-584.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
court,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
that
case.
