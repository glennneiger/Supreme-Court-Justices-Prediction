mr.
preston
easley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
issues
in
this
case
that
go
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
mr.
gizoni
and
southwest
marine.
it
affects
the
rights
of
many
other
maritime
employees,
and
by
way
of
example,
i
concluded
a
jury
trial
in
federal
court
in
san
diego
on
friday
in
which
a
tugboat
operator
was
hurt
on
a
tugboat
owned
by
a
shipyard
in
san
diego,
and
the
jury
found
that
he
was
a
seaman
and
awarded
benefits
under
the
longshore
act,
and
the
shipyard
does
not
accept
that
finding
and
has
vowed
that
they
will
follow
gizoni
to
the
supreme
court
because
they...
as
it
seems
that
every
shipyard
has
this
attitude...
that
the
longshore
act
grants
them
some
type
of
blanket
immunity
from
the
jones
act.
somehow
they
were--
mr.
preston
easley
--he
was
awarded
benefits
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
preston
easley
yes,
he
was
awarded
benefits
under
the
jones
act,
but
the
shipyard
employer
believes
that
the
longshore
act
gives
them
a
blanket
immunity
from
jones
act
claims.
section
902
of
the
longshore
act
describes
the
covered
employees
under
the
act,
and
i
won't
read
all
the
covered
employees
but
it
indicates
ship
repairman,
shipbuilders,
ship
breakers,
and
people
in
those
occupations.
it
then
goes
on
to
list
eight
exclusions
to
coverage.
there
are
many,
many
ship
repairmen
that
are
not
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
if
you're
repairing
a
recreational
vessel
under
65
feet,
you're
not
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
if
you're
repairing
a
vessel
under
18
tons,
you're
not
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
if
you're
repairing
a
vessel
that
is
being
used
as
a
floating
museum
or
a
floating
restaurant,
you're
not
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
if
you're
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel,
you're
not
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
it
seems
that
southwest
marine
wants
to
recognize
all
the
exclusions
to
the
longshore
act
except
that
one
exclusion
because
they
believe
it
works
to
their
disfavor.
rather
than
immunizing
shipyards
from
jones
act
lawsuits,
the
longshore
act,
i
believe
in
its
language
contemplates
and
allows
the
employee
to
attempt
his
jones
act
claim
first.
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
believe
that.
section
903
of
the
longshore
act,
paragraph
(e)
says
notwithstanding
any
other
provisions
of
law,
any
amounts
paid
to
an
employee
for
the
same
injury,
disability,
or
death
for
which
benefits
are
claimed
under
this
act,
pursuant
to
any
other
worker's
compensation
law
or
section
20
of
the
act,
and
then
it
describes
in
parentheses,
46
u.s.
code
688,
parentheses,
relating
to
recovering
for
injury
or
death
of
seaman
shall
be
credited
against
any
liability
imposed
by
this
act.
so
that
provision
gives
a
credit
under
the
longshore
act
for
any
benefits
paid
under
the
jones
act.
so
they
realize
that
some
people
may
take
the
jones
act
route
first.
there
is
another
section
of
the
longshore
act
that
i
believe
specifically
gives--
mr.
preston
easley
--i
agree
with
that,
it
doesn't
authorize
a
jones
act
claim,
but
it
contemplates
that
a
worker
who
is
employed
in
one
of
those
occupations
might
seek
jones
act
benefits.
mr.
preston
easley
there
is
another
provision
in
the
longshore
act
that
i
believe
more
specifically
gives
a
shipyard
employee
a
right
to
go
under
the
longshore
act
first,
although
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that,
and
that
is
section
913(d)
of
the
longshore
act,
filing
of
claims.
and
it
says,
tolling
provision:
where
recovery
is
denied
to
any
person
in
a
suit
brought
at
law
or
an
admiralty...
and
the
jones
act
is
law
and
maintenance
and
cure
are
admiralty...
to
recover
damages
in
respect
of
injury
or
death
on
the
ground
that
such
person
was
an
employee
and
that
the
defendant
was
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
this
act,
and
that
such
employer
had
secured
compensation
to
such
employee
under
this
act,
the
limitation
of
time
prescribed
in
subdivision
(a)
shall
begin
to
run
only
from
the
date
of
termination
of
such
suit.
so
i
interpret
that
to
say,
if
you
work
for
a
shipyard,
you
can
go
file
your
jones
act
lawsuit,
and
if
the
trier
of
fact
finds
that
you
are
covered
by
the
longshore
act,
that
you
are
not
excluded
as
a
vessel
crew
member,
then
that
tolls
the
statute
and
they
keep
your
longshore
act
remedies
alive
so
you
can
come
back
and
reenter
the
longshore
act.
mr.
preston
easley
it
is
the
u.s.
department
of
labor.
mr.
preston
easley
it
is
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
program.
mr.
preston
easley
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
easley
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
determination
of
the
courts,
whether
or
not
it
has
an
effect.
mr.
preston
easley
i
would
think
that
such
a
regulation
violates
the
longshore
act.
the
agency
doesn't
have
unlimited
license
to
modify
the
provision.
suppose
the
agency
said,
we
are
going
to
issue
a
regulation
that
the
longshore
act
does
not
apply
to
women.
nobody's
going
to
recognize
that.
so
i
think
the
regulations
have
got
to
be
consistent
with
the
act.
mr.
preston
easley
i
think
that
is
fair
to
say,
that
the
courts
give
the
final
meaning
to
the
regulation
and
the
determination
of
whether
the
regulation
is
consistent
with
existing
law.
mr.
preston
easley
i
have
a
description
of
a
maritime
employee
here
that
is
two
sentences
long.
it
says:
his
duties
consisted
of
taking
general
care
of
the
barge.
they
included
taking
care
of
lines
at
docks,
tightening
or
slackening
them
as
necessary,
repairing
leaks,
pumping
out
the
barge,
taking
lines
from
tugs,
responding
to
whistles
from
tugs,
putting
out
navigational
lights
and
signals,
taking
orders
from
the
tugboat
when
being
towed.
mr.
preston
easley
that
is
what
i
am
going
to...
that's
from
a
supreme
court
case
called
norton
v.
warner
that's
cited
in
my
brief.
in
reading
those
lines,
that
is
a
near-perfect
description
of
my
client,
bryon
gizoni,
who
was
a
rigger
in
the
shipyard
and
he
handled
these
barges,
moved
them
around
the
shipyard
from
pier
to
pier,
moved
them
to
the
navy
base,
took
them
where
they
needed
to--
mr.
preston
easley
--i
believe
that
wilander
is
consistent
with
those
earlier
supreme
court
decisions.
mr.
preston
easley
i
would
say
that
in
one
way
wilander
liberalized
the
situation,
and
in
another
way
it
restricted
the
remedy.
it
restricted
it
by
making
it
a
combined
issue
of
fact
and
law
rather
than
just
fact;
but
it,
by
getting
rid
of
the
aid
to
navigation
test,
that
probably
swung
open
the
biggest
door
that
has
ever
been
swung
open
since
the
courts
have
been
defining
seaman
status.
so
i
think
wilander
ultimately
makes
it
a
lot
easier
to
prove
seaman
status,
because
you
had
so
many
cases
where
people
were
performing
functions
on
vessels
and
the
vessel
had
no
transportation
function.
the
vessel
was
a
dredge
or
used
to
pump
waste
oil
or
something
like
that.
so
i
think
that
wilander
opened
it
up
quite
a
bit.
there
is
also
an
interesting
sentence
in
wilander
that
directly
addresses
the
issue
that
is
raised
for
review
in
this
case,
and
that's,
should
people's
status
be
determined
by
their
occupation,
or
should
their
remedy
be
determined
by
their
occupation?
and
in
wilander
it
says
it
is
not
the
employee's
particular
job
that
is
determinative,
but
the
employee's
connection
to
a
vessel.
and
that's
mr.
gizoni's
position
here.
as
far
as
making
seaman
status
a
factual
issue,
wilander
creates
some
bounds
for
it,
but
it
still,
i
think,
leaves
it
pretty
wide
open
because
it
says,
if
reasonable
persons,
applying
the
proper
legal
standard
could
differ
as
to
whether
the
employee
was
a
member
of
the
crew,
it
was
a
question
for
the
jury.
and
i
think
that's
a
scenario--
mr.
preston
easley
--the
jury
usually
just
makes
a
general
determination
as
to
whether
he
had
seaman
status,
and
the
judge--
mr.
preston
easley
--yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
preston
easley
sometimes
it
can
be
a
question
of
law.
there
have
been
judicial
decisions
that
a
floating
drydock
is
not
a
vessel,
and
even
though
i
take
issue
with
that
judicial
determination,
the
law
has
stated
that
floating
drydocks,
even
though
they
can
move
from
port
to
port,
are
not
vessels
in
navigation
for
jones
act
purposes.
there
is
another
scenario--
mr.
preston
easley
--not
always.
mr.
preston
easley
that's
right.
mr.
preston
easley
that's
right.
there
is
another
situation
where
the
law
has
determined
vessel
status,
and
that
is,
if
you
are
using
a
barge
to
move
things
around
in
a
shipyard
or
some
other
location,
the
barge
will
probably
qualify
as
a
vessel
in
navigation.
some
shipyards
and
maritime
employers
take
barges
and
they
fasten
them
all
to
the
dock
and
they
tie
up
vessels
against
the
outboard
side
of
the
barge
and
they
use
the
barge
as
a
dock.
and
the
courts
have
held
that
if
you
are
using
a
barge
for
a
dock,
then
the
barge
does
not
become
a
vessel
in
navigation.
so
there
are
certain
scenarios
where
the
court
has
said,
this
is
just
not
a
vessel
in
navigation
for
jones
act
purposes,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
those
should
be
thrown
to
the
jury
every
time
and
let
the
jury
overturn
these
legal
decisions.
but
i
agree
with
the
language
in
wilander
that
when
reasonable
minds
can
differ,
then
it's
a
question
that
should
go
to
the
jury.
i
want
to
point
out
something
else
about
how
ridiculous
this
occupation
test
is
if
you
want
to
read
it
literally.
and
that
is,
the
longshore
act
is
extended
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
by
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
and
the
occupations
enumerated
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
are
workers
involved
in
exploring,
developing,
removing,
or
transporting
natural
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
so
if
we
are
going
to
devise
a
statutory
occupational
test,
then
i
guess
every
member
of
a
crew
boat
that
takes
workers
offshore,
every
kind
of
vessel
used
in
this
offshore
oil
drilling
and
exploration
and
transportation
would
fall
under
the
jones
act.
even
some
of
the
oil
companies
have
proposed
removing
oil
from
fixed
platforms
with
oil
tankers
and
shipping
the
oil
away
from
the
platform.
so
if
we
are
going
to
be
literal
on
the
occupation,
then
all
those
tanker
crews
that
are
pumping
oil
off
the
outer
continental
shelf
are
going
to
have
to
first
submit
themselves
to
the
department
of
labor
for
a
finding
of
seaman
status.
that's
why
the
occupational
test
is
too
unreasonable
to
apply.
the
court
has
made
a
similar
ruling
or
a
ruling
in
a
case
similar
to
this.
it
is
a
footnote
in
gray
v.
herb's
welding
which
dealt
with
longshore
jurisdiction
versus
state
workers'
compensation
jurisdiction
for
the
first
3
miles
offshore.
and
there
is
a
footnote
by
the
supreme
court
that
says,
"floating
structures
have
been
treated
as
vessels
by
lower
courts.
"
"workers
on
them,
unlike
workers
on
fixed
platforms,
enjoy
the
same
remedies
as
workers
on
ships.
"
so
i
think
there
is
some
precedent
that
says
that
there
is
no
longshore
act
exclusion
from
people
in
those
occupations
seeking
seaman
status.
something
that's
an
interesting
comparison
that
has
come
into
my
own
mind
with
regard
to
your
wilander
case
is
virtually
every
shipyard
has
a
paint
barge.
that's
a
barge
that
has
scaffolding
permanently
mounted
on
it
that
is
moved
all
around
the
shipyard
to
paint
the
offshore
side
of
each
vessel.
and
i
would
think
it
unusual
to
have
a
system
where
an
individual
painting
a
fixed
oil
rig
from
a
boat
could
have
seaman
status,
but
a
man
painting
a
vessel
from
a
floating
barge
that
moves
around
the
shipyard
could
not
seek
seaman
status.
in
a
lot
of
these
cases
that
were
decided
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
fifties,
the
individuals
very
arguably
had
harbor
worker
status
rather
than
jones
act,
but
they
were
still
given
the
right
to
have
these
issues
determined
by
the
jury.
mr.
preston
easley
in
legal
terms,
none.
the
barge
is
a
vessel
in
navigation
for
purposes
of
the
jones
act,
and
that's
stated
in
the
norton
v.
warner
case
and
it's
stated
in
other
cases.
it
is
defined
as
any
contrivance
capable
of
transportation
on
water.
the
longshore
act
provides
some
immunity
to
shipyards
that
i
am
going
to
concede
them.
if
the
person
is
not
a
member
of
the
vessel
crew,
the
'84
amendments
did
away
with
the
dual-capacity
doctrine,
where
the
shipyard
has
a
dual
capacity
as
vessel
owner
in
addition
to
its
capacity
as
the
employer.
so
when
vessels
are
in
the
yard
for
repair,
the
shipyard
repairman
cannot
claim
that
the
shipyard
is
owner
pro
hac
vice
of
the
vessel
being
repaired
and
then
sue
the
shipyard
in
a
second
capacity
as
owner
pro
hac
vice
of
the
vessel.
but
for
the
shipyard
to
get
that
immunity,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
that
the
worker
is
covered
by
the
longshore
act
and
not
a
member
of
the
crew.
i
have
heard
the
term
"land
based"
bantered
around
a
lot
in
this
litigation.
whether
a
person
is
land
based
or
not
i
don't
think
determines
the
issue.
there
are
many
people
that
are
land...
that
don't
sleep
on
the
vessel,
that
are
land
based:
ferry
boat
operators,
tour
boat
operators,
tugboat
operators
in
a
harbor.
shipyards
want
to
force
jones
act
employees
into
the
longshore
act,
and
the
test
they
want
to
use
is,
workers
that
are
arguably
covered
by
the
longshore
act
should
have
to
go
to
the
department
of
labor
first.
and
that
raises
a
real
interesting
question
as
to
who
makes
this
determination
as
to
who
is
arguably
covered
by
the
longshore
act,
who
then
has
to
go
to
the
department
of
labor,
because
according
to
the
shipyards,
the
tugboat
operators
and
captains
are
arguably
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
thank
you.
