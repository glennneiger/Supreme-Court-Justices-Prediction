mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
this
primary
jurisdiction
point.
we
see
no
basis
in
the
longshore
act,
including
its
1972
amendments
or
the
jones
act
for
concluding
that
congress
intended
to
remit
the
determination
of
seaman
status
to
the
special
expertise
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
juries
have
been
making
that
determination
under
the
jones
act
since
1920.
federal
courts
sitting
in
admiralty
have
been
making
that
determination
since
long
before
that,
and
in
fact,
we
think
a
provision
of
the
longshore
act
refutes
the
primary
jurisdiction
argument.
section
13(d),
33
u.s.c.
913(d)
tolls
the
statute
of
limitations
under
the
longshore
act,
in
the
event
that
a
suit
is
brought
at
law
or
in
admiralty.
we
think
if
the
secretary
were
meant
to
have
primary
jurisdiction,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
have
a
tolling
provision,
certainly
not
a
perfectly
general
tolling
provision
such
as
13(d).
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
would
think
not,
after...
it
is
perfectly
clear
after
wilander
that
seaman
is
linked
to
master
or
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
if
the
secretary
were
to
issue
a
regulation
interpreting
that
phrase,
i
would
think
it
would
be
entitled
to
deference
from
the
courts.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
if
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
phrase
"master
or
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
"
and
i
draw
that
conclusion
from
the
court's
holding
in
wilander
that
master
or
member
of
a
crew
restates
who
is
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
if
the
issue
of
seaman
status
is
actually
litigated
and
adjudicated
in
the
proceeding
under
the
longshore
act,
then
we
do
think
that
there
would
be
issue
preclusion.
our
position
in
this
case
does
rest
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
we
do
think
it's
quite
clear,
under
the
exclusions
of
section
2(3)
of
the
longshore
act,
that
a
ship
repairman,
if
he
or
she
is
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel,
is
not
covered
by
the
longshore
act
and
is
entitled
to
a
remedy
under
the
jones
act.
if
the
ship
repairman
has
a
sufficiently
permanent
connection
to
a
vessel
in
navigation,
which
may
be
a
vessel
that
stays
entirely
within
a
harbor,
and
if
that
ship
repairman
contributes
to
the
function
of
the
vessel
or
the
accomplishment
of
its
mission,
which
may
be
a
special
purpose,
then
that
repairman
would
meet
the
definition
of
a
seaman
or
a
member
of
a
crew.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
we
don't...
well,
yes,
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor.
they
are
mutually
exclusive,
if
you
are
a
master
or
a
member
of
a
crew,
then
you
are
covered
by
the
jones
act
and
not
by
the
longshore
act.
we
think
petitioner's
argument
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
other
exclusions.
there
are
eight
of
them.
the
exclusion
for
a
master
or
member
of
a
crew
is
only
one.
there
is
an
exclusion
for
a
ship
repairman
who
is
employed
to
repair
a
recreational
vessel
under
65
feet.
that's
section
2(3)(f).
there
is
an
exclusion
for
a
ship
repairman
engaged
by
the
master
to
repair
a
vessel
under
18
tons
net.
that's
section
2(3)(h).
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
statute
that
section
2(3)
defines
a
very
broad
category
of
maritime
employee
and
then
cuts
out
various
subcategories,
including
a
master
or
member
of
a
vessel.
we
also
think
petitioner's
position
to
contrary
to
this
court's
recognition
in
wilander
that
seaman
status
is
not
a
pure
question
of
law,
but
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact;
and
therefore,
if
reasonable
persons,
applying
the
correct
legal
standard
could
differ
as
to
whether
the
employer
was
a
member
of
a
crew,
it
is
a
question
for
the
finder
of
fact.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
can
be,
your
honor.
we
think
in
certain
cases
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
the
district
court
to
decide
that
question
as
a
matter
of
law.
as
we
understand
it
for
example,
a
construction
platform,
even
if
it
floats
on
water,
is
not
a
vessel
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
cases
that
so
hold.
there
are
cases
that
suggest
that.
fontenont
against
awi
is
one.
this
is
a
long
proceeding
that
involves
a
number
of
informal
stages
under
the
longshore
act.
there
are
cases
such
as
boatel
v.
delaware
that
hold
that
the
informal
stages
are
not
sufficient
to
give
a
collateral
estoppel
effect.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
would
have
to
be
there
and
actually
litigated,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
don't
agree
that
that
will
be
the
result
in
every
case.
litigation
is
costly.
we
think
there
are
workers
who
are
clearly
covered
under
the
longshore
act
and
not
under
the
jones
act.
in
those
cases--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
to
be
honest
that
in
doubtful
cases,
there
is
some
incentive
to
go
ahead
and
litigate
the
issue.
we
think
the
legislative
history
supports
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
original
1927
act
actually
had
a
provision
in
it
at
one
point
that
would
have
extended
the
longshore
act
to
crew
members
of
all
vessels
owned
by
u.s.
citizens,
and
that
was
taken
out.
the
court
discussed
that
in
south
chicago
coal
against
bassett,
and
the
'72
amendments
which
added
this
more
expansive
definition
of
maritime
employment
were
intended
to
extend
the
coverage
to
certain
injuries
on
land,
not
to
restrict--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
under
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
the
employee
would
want
to
prove
he's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right,
but
the
employer
would
prefer
to
pay
under
the
longshore
act
in
many
cases
because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
in
practice
in
many
cases,
of
course,
these
workers
don't
have
the
resources
and
may
be
in
genuine
doubt
about
which
the
two
schemes
covers
them.
so
they
will
go
in
and
make
a
claim
under
the
longshore
act
and
then
they
may--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it
does
run
that
risk,
your
honor.
let
me
just
say
very
briefly
about
policy,
there
is
no
risk
of
double
recovery
here.
it
is
well
established
that
you
get
a
credit
for
any
amount
paid
under
one
statute
against
any
liability
under
the
other
statute.
and
it's
not
clear
to
us
that
the
costs
will
be
much
higher
under
this
system.
petitioner's
proposed
rule
we
think
would
still
leave
a
lot
of
uncertainty
about
whether
particular
workers
are
covered,
and
the
situation
we
have
here
is
basically
the
situation
that
we
had
in
the
fifth
circuit,
possibly
the
largest
admiralty
circuit,
since
1959
when
they
decided
the
robison
case,
until
very
recently
when
they
decided
this
pizzitolo
case.
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
there
have
not
been
ruinous
insurance
costs
or
a
tremendous
flood
of
litigation
in
the
fifth
circuit.
so
we
do
believe
that
this
is
a
rule
that
the
employers
can
live
with...
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
