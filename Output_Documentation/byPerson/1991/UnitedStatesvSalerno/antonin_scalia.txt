justice
scalia
mr.
feldman,
don't
you
think
a
similar
motive
means
similar
in
degree?
do
you
think
it's
enough
that
you
have
some
very
slight,
remote
motive
of
the
same...
why
would
it
make
any
sense
to
write
a
rule
like
that
if
you
have
some
vestige
of
a
motive
of
the
same
type...
although
it
is
not
remotely
the
same
in
degree?
why
would
that
assure
reliability?
justice
scalia
you
mean
similar
in
degree,
as
well
as
in
time.
justice
scalia
and
i
don't
understand
your
argument
that
you
think
this
whole
thing
should
be
considered
under
(b)(5)
instead
of
under
(b)(1)?
how
could
you
consider
under
(b)(5)...
(b)(5)
requires
that
the
statement
not
be
specifically
covered
by
any
of
the
foregoing
exceptions.
do
you
think
that
one
that
does
not
qualify
for
one
of
the
foregoing
exceptions
because
it
doesn't
come
within
the
exception...
although
it
is
prior
testimony...
could
nonetheless
qualify
under
(5)?
justice
scalia
you
mean
the
district
court
can
say,
well,
this
is
really
not
a
similar
motive.
it's
not
similar
in
kind,
it's
not
similar
in
degree,
but
what
the
heck,
we're
going
to
bring
it
in
under
(5)
because
we
think
it's
reliable
anyway...
even
though
the
rule
says
it's
not
reliable
unless
it's
similar?
justice
scalia
well,
but
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
saying,
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
government
has
no
basis
to
complain
about
that
because
the
government
has
the
remedy
right
in
its
pocket.
justice
scalia
if
you
don't
think
it's
reliable
enough,
then
give
them
immunity.
justice
scalia
if
this
is
a
factual
question
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court,
they're
at
something
of
a
disadvantage
in
arguing
about
the
motive,
aren't
they?
because
they...
i
mean,
the
government
knows
what
the
transcript
says,
and
they
don't
know.
or
do
you
propose
that
in
these
factual
inquiries
the
defendant
be
given
the
grand
jury--
justice
scalia
mr.
tigar,
do
i
have
the
question
presented
wrong?
i
thought
that
under
the
question
presented,
we
are
assuming
that
the
government
lacked
motive
to
cross-examine.
as
i
read
the
question
presented,
it's
whether
federal
rule
of
evidence
authorizes
admissions
against
the
government
of
the
former
testimony
of
a
declarant
who
has
been
rendered
unavailable
by
his
assertion
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege,
even
though
the
government
lacked
any
motive
to
cross-examine,
when--
justice
scalia
--well,
it's
an
easy
case,
then.
i
mean
we
took
the
case
to
decide
the
question
presented.
justice
scalia
you're
telling
us
it's
an
easy
case.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
derisory,
mr.
tigar.
i--
justice
scalia
--i
don't
want
to
use
derisory,
but
i
think
you're
not
using
the
right
word.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
tigar,
did
the
court
of
appeals
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
finding
no
similar
motive?
it
didn't
reach
that
question,
did
it?
justice
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
meet
the
de
novo
requirement,
but
it
meets
enough
of
the
requirement
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
enough
basis
on
the
facts
to
reverse
the
district
court.
they
said--
justice
scalia
--there
may
have
been
no
motive,
as
the
rule
requires.
justice
scalia
i
have
one
more...
you
mentioned
that
one
of
the
two
witnesses
was
given
immunity
for
future
testimony
as
well.
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
well,
then
why
was...
why
was
he
unavailable?
