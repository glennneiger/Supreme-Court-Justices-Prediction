chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-872,
united
states
against
salerno.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
question
whether
or
not
there
was
a
similar
motive?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
feldman,
is
it
still
the
law
as
it
was
when
i
went
to
law
school
and
when
i
practiced
that
the
district
court...
the
trial
court
is
given
a
considerable
amount
of
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
is
relevant
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
a
district
court
could
decide
some
of
these
questions
either
way,
and
should
not
be
reversed
by
a
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
tigar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
no,
that
was
never
suggested,
even
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it,
that
it
was
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
your
argument
really
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
the
government
was
obligated
to
immunize
these
people,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
not
saying
it
was
involved
in
this
case,
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out...
you're
saying,
then...
if
you're
not
saying
that
in
this
case
the
government
has
to
immunize
the
witness,
you're
saying
then
that
you
simply
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
the
rule
that
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
the
similar
motive
requirement
evaporates
under
certain
circumstances?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tiger.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
mr.
feldman,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
a
chance
to
ask
one
question
of
you.
the
first
section...
you
have
three
parts
of
your
brief.
and
the
first
one
you
discuss
is
the
government
did
not
have
a
similar
motive
to
develop
the
grand
jury
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
my
question
is
why
did
you
include
that
argument
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
that
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
