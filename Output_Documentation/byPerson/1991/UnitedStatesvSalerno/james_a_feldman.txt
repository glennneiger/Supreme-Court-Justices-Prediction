mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
an
issue
concerning
the
proper
interpretation
of
federal
rule
of
evidence
804(b)(1).
under
rule
804(b)(1)
former
testimony
is
admissible
if
the
party
against
whom
the
testimony
is
offered
had
an
opportunity
and
similar
motive
to
cross-examine
the
declarant
at
the
time
the
testimony
was
given.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
that
express
similar
motive
requirement
was
irrelevant,
and
that
the
former
testimony
at
issue
here...
which
was
grand
jury
testimony...
was
admissible
under
rule
804(b)(1).
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
they
did
not.
the
court
of
appeals...
the
only
thing
they
said
about
whether
there
was
a
similar
motive
was
that
they
agreed...
i
think
this
is
almost
a
quote...
they
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
government
may
well
not
have
had
a
similar
motive
to
cross-examine
the
declarants.
they
didn't
say...
i
don't
think
there's
a
word
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
or
in
their
later
opinion
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
bahadar
where
they
attempted
to
clarify
their
opinion
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
there's
a
word
in
either
opinion
that
suggests
that
they
thought
the
government
did
have
a
similar
motive.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
believe
that
was
largely
a
determination
of
fact.
the
district
court
made--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
factors
that
influenced
the
district
court...
a
lot
of
those
factors
would
probably
be
present
in
other
cases.
and
therefore,
i
think
district
courts
would
frequently...
and
should...
reach
the
same
conclusion
that
the
district
court
did
here.
but
the
district
court,
when
it
made
that
decision,
had
before
it
the
particular
grand
jury
transcripts
at
issue
here.
the
court
had
sealed
materials
that
it
referred
to
in
its
opinion,
actually.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
do
think
it's
an
issue
of
fact.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
i
think
that
as
a
general
matter
that's
certainly...
that's
certainly
true
under
rule
804(b)(1),
as
the
rule
would
be
applied
to
a
variety
of
different
former
proceedings.
i
think
in
particular,
with
respect
to
grand
jury
proceedings,
the
answer
should
almost
always
or
always
be,
because
of
the
structure
of
the
proceeding,
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
that
the
proceeding
is
undertaking,
that
the
answer
should
almost
always
be
that
the
government
did
not
have
a
similar
motive.
insofar
as...
in
fact,
i
think
generally
the
considerations
as
to
whether
hearsay
grand
jury
testimony
should
be
admitted
against
the
government
or
against
a
defendant,
i
think
that
it's
more
profitably
considered
as
a
general
matter
under
rule
804(b)(5),
where
a
court
can
look
at
the
particular
circumstantial
guarantees
of
trustworthiness
and
look
at
the
whole
situation
and
decide
whether
there
is
some
basis
to
think
that
the
testimony
is
reliable
enough
to
be
introduced
at
trial.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
i
guess...
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
it's
been
seen
as
largely
a
case-by-case
factual
determination.
there
hasn't
been
a
lot
of
detailed
legal
discussion
about
what
would
and
would
not
constitute
similar
motive.
the
factual...
the
issue
is
whether
the
party
against
whom
it's
offered
had
the...
had
a
motive
to
cross-examine
in
the
prior
case
so
that
that
party
fairly
can
be
held
to
what
it
did
with
the
witness
in
the
prior
case
or
the
prior
proceeding.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think,
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
right,
it
would
be
a
similar
motive...
at
least...
if
what...
if
you
have
a
particular
piece
of
testimony
that
someone
has
given,
the
question
is
what
is
the
government's
motive
to
discredit
that
testimony,
and
what
is
the
government's
motive
to
discredit
it
by
confronting
that
witness
with
a
full
cross-examination,
as
opposed
to
by
just
introducing
contrary
evidence
when
the
witness
leaves
the
grand
jury.
and
i
think
regardless
of
whether
the
government
would
want
a
perjury
prosecution...
in
your
hypothetical...
or
for
some
other
reason,
if
the
government
has
a
reason
to
fully...
to
discredit
the
witness'
testimony
and
to
fully
confront
that
witness
with
full-scale
cross-examination,
with
full-scale
confrontation
with
the
evidence
against
that
witness,
as
it
would
do
at
trial,
then
i
think
it
would
have
a
similar
motive.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
quibble
with
the
question
just
insofar
as
i'm
not
sure
that
the
government
did
have
much
of
a
motive
to
discredit
these
witnesses.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i...
the
government
may
have
some...
maybe
i...
the
government
may
have
some
motive
to
show
that.
but
it...
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
grand
jury...
in
a
grand
jury
investigation
the
issues
are
not...
they
are
not
focused
on
particular
charges
as
they
might
be
at
trial,
and
there
may
be
testimony
that's
given
in
a
grand
jury
that
turns
out
not
to
be
very
relevant
or
important
to
the
government
at
that
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
well,
the
rule
requires
similarity
of
motive,
not
total
absence
of
motive.
but
in
any
event,
let
me
proceed
to
the
other
part
of
your
question.
i
think
where
the
government
did
not
cross-examine
witnesses,
in
order
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
proceeding,
it
was
not
a
tactical
decision
that
the
government
made
in
order
to
improve
the
strength
of
its
case,
if
you
can
talk
about
that
in
the
grand
jury.
it
was
a
decision
that
the
government
made
in
order
to...
in
part,
in
order
to
preserve
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury,
to
protect
informants,
to
protect
methods
of
investigations...
for
all
of
those
sorts
of
reasons.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
believe
they
are.
the
motive...
if
you
look
at
the
rule,
the
rule
is
not...
is
motive
to
develop
the
testimony
by
direct,
re-direct,
or
cross-examination.
it's
not
motive
to
discredit
the
witnesses.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
make
a
distinction
between
those
things.
it
may
be
that
the
government
had
a
motive
to
discredit
the
witnesses...
although
as
i
said,
it
may
be
quite
different
from
its
motive
at
trial.
but
it
doesn't
have
the
same
motive
in
the
grand
jury
to
develop...
to
discredit
them
by
developing
their
testimony,
as
opposed
to,
by,
for
instance,
simply
introducing
surveillance
tapes,
by
introducing
the
evidence
of
other
informants.
and,
in
fact,
it
has
a
positive
motive
not
to
do
some
of
those
things
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
investigation
itself.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
again,
i
don't
really
want
to
make
broad
rules
for
all
of
these
things.
i
guess
my...
i
would...
i
think
at
a
preliminary
hearing
the
situation
is
sufficiently
different
from
a
grand
jury
that
at
least
frequently
the
defendant
will
have
the
same
motive.
where
a
defendant
chooses,
for
tactical
reasons,
not
to
examine
the
witness,
it's
not
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
and
it's
not
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
is
to
determine
whether
there's
probable
cause
to
hold
the
defendant.
it's
for
really
some
other
reason
that
i
think
more
appropriately
is
labelled
tactical.
i
think
the
situation
in
the
grand
jury
is
rather
different.
in
the
grand
jury
the
charges
have
not
clearly
been
articulated,
or
even
perhaps
focused
on
or
made
at
the
time
that
a
witness
testifies.
and
the
positive
reasons
the
government
has
not
to
develop
the
declarant's
testimony
relate
directly
to
maintaining...
not
to
advancing
its
position
in
that
hearing,
but
maintaining
the
ability
of
the
grand
jury
to
investigate...
continue
to
investigate
the
crimes
and
bring
an
indictment
in
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i...
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
the
rule
requires
similar
motive.
if
you
look
at
the
notes
of
the
advisory
committee
that
drafted
the
rule,
they
considered
identity
of
motive,
i
believe,
as
a
possibility,
and
decided
that
similar
or...
then
they
considered
substantially...
substantial
identity,
i
think...
actually,
that...
i
may
not
be
right
about
that.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
should
be
similar
both
in
type
and
degree.
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
tend
to
think
that
it
can.
if
you
look...
at
least
let
me
say
this.
it's
not
an
issue
that
has
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
but
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
lower
courts
have
dealt
with,
for
instance,
grand
jury
testimony
and
so
on,
they
have
felt...
they
have
dealt
with
it
as
if
it
doesn't
come
in
under
one
of
the
(1)
through
(4)
exceptions,
that
it
still
could
come
under
(5),
if
it
has
the
proper
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
believe...
well,
i
think
a
district
court
could
say
we're
going
to
look
at
this
testimony
and
look
at
all
of
its
characteristics,
including
the
relationship
of
the
declarant
to
the
defendants,
to
the
government,
the
circumstances
under
which
the
declarant
testified.
there
may
be
a
number
of
other
factors
that
are
worthwhile
in
looking
at
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
circumstantial
guarantee
of
trustworthiness.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that's
right.
generally.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
under
the
federal
rules,
the
courts
of
appeals
articulate
the
standard
differently.
but
generally,
it's
abuse
of
discretion
standard
or
something
like
that,
as
to
the
degree
of
discretion
that
a
district
court
has
to
rule
on
evidentiary
issues.
in
this
case,
i
might
add,
the
district
court
had
before
it
9
months
of
trial.
it
was
quite
familiar
with
what
the
issues
at
trial
were
and
the
contentions
of
the
parties.
it
had
the
grand
jury
transcripts.
it
had
the
sealed
submissions
of
the
government.
it
had
arguments
of
counsel.
based
on
all
those
things,
and
looking
at
the
direct
text
of
the
rule,
the
district
court
held
that
the
evidence
was...
was
not
admissible
because
there
was
no
similar
motive.
the
court
of
appeals
kind
of...
by
holding
that
it
had
to
be
admitted
under
rule
804(b)(1),
it
put
the
district...
it
puts
district
courts
in
a
kind
of
odd
situations
since
they
have
to
decide...
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
text
of
the
rule
says
similar
motive,
they
now
have
to
decide
when
a
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
feel
that
fairness
or
something
like
that
requires
that
the
text
of
the
rule
be
ignored
or
disregarded...
or,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
one
place,
evaporates.
i
think
the
linchpin
of
our
argument,
and
i
think
the
key
point
to
make
in
this
case
is
that
the
rule...
the
text
of
rule
804(b)(1)
is
entirely
unambiguous.
it
requires
opportunity
and
similar
motive.
the
opponent
of
the
testimony
have
to...
has
to
have
opportunity
and
similar
motive
to
develop
the
testimony.
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
were
enacted
into
law
by
congress.
and
absent
a
holding
that
rule
804(b)(1)
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
case...
and
there
was
no
such
holding
by
either
of
the
courts
below,
nor
do
we
believe
any
such
holding
is
possible
on
the
facts
of
this
case...
the
rules
must
simply
be
applied
according
to
their
terms.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
similar
motive
requirement...
and,
in
fact,
in
one
place
they
said
the
opportunity
requirement,
as
well...
is
irrelevant,
or
evaporates.
and
we
believe
that
since
rule...
since
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
were
enacted
by
congress,
the
specific
terms
of
those
rules
have
to
govern
in
criminal
cases,
and
the
district
court
was
correct
in
relying
on
the
specific
terms
of
that
rule.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
make
up
exception...
a
new
hearsay
exception,
rule
804(b)(6),
which
is
where
testimony
has
been...
where
a
defendant
has
hearsay
testimony...
hearsay
evidence
that
the
defendant
believes
is
exculpatory,
and
where
the
declarant
takes
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
government
doesn't
immunize
the
declarant,
that
hearsay
testimony
is
admissible
at
trial,
period.
i
don't
find
any
principle
of
that
nature
in
the
federal
rules.
i
think
there
would
be
a
lot
of
reasons
why
a
rule
of
that
sort
would
be
a
mistake
to
adopt.
but
in
any
event
it's
not
there,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
authority,
in
essence,
to
adopt
it
for
purposes
of
this
case.
i
would
add
that
the
error
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
we
agree,
actually.
in
fact,
the
predicate
for
getting
evidence
in
under
any
of
the
rule
804(b)
exceptions
is
that
the
witness
is
unavailable.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
the...
therefore,
in
order
for
the
defendants
to
get
the...
the
evidence
in
in
this
case,
there
had
to
be
a
finding
that
the
witness
is
unavailable.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
the
availability
to
the
government,
i
think
is
of
no
consequence
here.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
about
that.
but
even
if
they
were
right,
if
the...
the
declarants
were...
if
the
declarants
were,
in
some
sense,
available,
the
consequence
of
that
would
simply
be
that
the
evidence
is
not
admissible
under
rule
804(b)(1),
because
804(b)(1)
requires,
initially,
that
the
declarants
be
unavailable.
so
i
just
didn't...
don't
follow
that
line
of
reasoning
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals'
error
was
not
merely
a
technical
one.
the
point
of
the
hearsay
rules
is
that
hearsay
evidence
is
not
admissible
unless
there's
some
specific
reason
to
believe
that
it's
reliable...
either
it
falls
within
one
of
the
general
categories
which
have
their
kind
of
categorical
guarantees
of
reliability,
or
within
the
residual
exception.
in
the
case
of
rule
804(b)(1)
that
purpose
is
served
by
requiring
that
the
party
against
whom
the
testimony
is
offered
have
the
opportunity
and
motive
to
cross-examine
or
to
develop
the
testimony
thoroughly.
and
where
a
party
has
had
that
kind
of
opportunity
and
motive,
it
provides
some
reason
to
think
that
the
testimony
is
trustworthy,
since
it's
been
subject
to
cross-examination.
and
moreover,
the
party
has
already
done...
where
it
had
the
opportunity
and
motive...
it's
already
done
what
it
would
have
done
at
trial,
and
it's
not
considered
to
be
that
unfair
to
then
introduce
the
hearsay
testimony.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
eliminates
the
motive
requirement
and
substitutes
nothing
else
in
its
place.
so
that
instead
of
the
standard
pattern
of
the
hearsay
rules,
where
there'd
be
some
reason
to
think
that
a...
hearsay
evidence
is
reliable
before
it's
admitted
in
evidence...
instead
of
that,
you
have
evidence
that's
never
subject
to
any
guarantee
of
reliability
or
any
reason
to
think
it's
reliable
at
all.
and,
indeed,
in
this
case,
the
district
court
held
that
the...
there
was
no
circumstantial
guarantee
of
reliability
in
considering
rule
804(b)(5),
and
held
that
they
didn't
think...
the
district
court
held
in
another...
i
think
in
its
opinion
that's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
that
there
was
just
no
reason
to
think
it's
reliable.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
i
think
that
trenches
seriously
on
the
executive
branch's
prerogative
to
grant
immunity.
but
more
importantly,
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
well,
where
a
party...
i
mean,
assertion
of
a
valid
privilege
is
specifically
defined
as
a
basis
for
a
finding
of
unavailability
in
the
rules.
the
rules
don't
anywhere
provide
that
if
a
party
somehow
could
make
a...
a
declarant
available,
that
then
the
hearsay
rules
just
vanish,
and
if
the
party
chooses
not
to
use
that
power
the
evidence
comes
in.
um--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
but
sure
if...
the
government
has
brady
obligations.
it
complied
with
those
brady
obligations
in
this
case.
it...
in
fact,
the
government
informed
the
defendant--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think...
i
would
think
that
that
would
come
something
under...
if
there's
a
brady
obligation
to
do
so,
i
think...
yeah,
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
under
the
right
circumstances,
yeah,
there
would
be.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't...
the
only
reason
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
categorically
is
because
it
might
depend
on
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
i
think
it's
rather
different
from
a
situation
where
the
government
doesn't
tell
the
defendants
where
the
witness
is.
the
general
rule
is
that
the
executive
branch
has
the
authority,
it
has
the
discretion
whether
to
immunize
witnesses.
it's
the
executive
branch
that
has
to,
in
a
sense,
pay
the
cost
by
foregoing
prosecution
when
someone
gets
immunized.
and
defendant
has
no
motive
to
avoid
immunizing
witnesses
so
they
can
later
be
prosecuted
for,
perhaps,
very
serious
crimes
they
might
have
committed.
in
this
case...
the
general
rule
is
that
the
defendant
has
to
bear...
has
to
bear
the
cost
of
not
having
access
to
witnesses
who
assert
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
just
as
the
government
does
in
cases
where
the
government
finds
it
not
worthwhile
to
immunize
them
because
the
government
wants
to
prosecute
them.
and
it
would
make
it
too
difficult.
the
government
did
what
it
was
required
to
do,
and
in
essence,
disclose
the
identity
and
the
whereabouts
of
the
defendant...
of
the
declarants
were
never
an
issue...
disclose
that
to
the
defendants.
and
that's
all
that
the
government's
obligation...
that
the
government
had
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
so
that's
what
i
was
saying.
and
i
wouldn't...
i
don't
want
to
answer
categorically,
because
i
think
it
depends
on
lots
of
things,
such
as
the
defendant's
real
motive
to
find
the
witness,
and
the
importance
of
the
testimony.
i
don't
think
you
can
give
a
categorical
answer
to
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
the
defendant
didn't...
they
didn't
have
that,
actually,
until
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
that's
what
they
had.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
their...
they
were
familiar
with
the
industry;
they
were
familiar
with
these
two
declarants
and
what
their
role
in
the
industry
was.
and
actually,
if
you
look
at
their
papers
below,
i
think
they
had
a
reasonably
good
idea
of
what
the
nature
of
the
testimony
was,
the
exculpatory
testimony.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
think
as
a
general
matter,
that
also...
that,
itself,
is
a
decision
the
district
court
has
to
make
in
light
of
rule
6(e).
there's
well-developed
law
about
under
what
circumstances
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
get
grand
jury
transcripts.
and
lots
of
evidentiary
decisions
might
be
made
in
a
district
court
where
one
party
or
another
submits
something
under
seal,
because
the
other
party
doesn't
yet
have
the
right
to
know
what
that
material
was.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
made
a
decision
on
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
that
the
defendants
didn't
need
the
text
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts.
and
that
ruling
was
not
reversed
on
appeal...
or
not
even
on...
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
comment
on
that
ruling.
in
short,
i
think
the
text
of
rule
804(b)(1)
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
former
testimony...
the
party
against
whom
former
testimony
is
offered
must
have
an
opportunity
and
similar
motive
to
cross-examine
the
declarant,
or
to
develop
the
testimony
fully
at
the
time
the
testimony
is
given.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
similar
motive
requirement
is
irrelevant,
or
evaporates
in
some
circumstances.
we
think
that
that's
a
clear
misreading
of
the
rules,
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
was
really
just
to...
show
the
background
of
this...
of
the
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--we
did
not
think...
moreover,
the
first
point
i
actually
was
going
to
make
is
if
you
look
at
the...
for
instance,
page
19a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals'
exact
statement,
and
they
only,
i
think,
say
this
is
the
only
statement
about
whether
the
government
had
similar
motive:
while
we
agree
that
the
government
may
have--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
sorry,
it's
page
19a
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
it's
the
very
last
paragraph,
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
paragraph.
while
we
agree
that
the
government
may
have
had
no
motive
before
the
grand
jury
to
impeach
the
allegedly-false
testimony
of
bruno
and
dematteis,
we
do
not
think
that
is
sufficient
to
exclude
the
evidence
at
trial.
i
think
that's
unambiguous.
and
they
never
suggest,
either
here
or
in
bahadar
or
anywhere
else,
that
they
thought
the
government
did
have
a
similar
motive.
they
actually...
if
you
look
at
24a,
they
make
another
statement
that
something...
the
same
effect.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
frankly,
we
thought
that...
we
knew
that
this
court...
it
is
possible
that
this
court
could
reach
an
issue
that
wasn't
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
expected
that
respondents
would
raise
that
issue,
and
wanted
to
provide--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
think
the
question
in
this...
that
question
can
be...
can
be
answered,
and
that
will
dispose
of
this
case...
if
it's
answered
as
we
think
it
should
be,
which
is
that
the
government...
the
similar
motive
requirement
is
relevant,
and
it's
something
that
is
required
for
admission
of
testimony
under
804(b)(1),
the
court
can
so
decide,
and
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
second
circuit,
and
that
would
require
reversal
of
the
second
circuit's
judgment
in
the
case.
so
it's
not
at
all
necessary
to
reach
any
similar
motive
issue,
although
i
think
that
the
similar
motive
findings
of
the
district
court
are
well
supported,
and
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
agreed
with
that.
as
far
as
the
immunity...
whether
these
witnesses
had...
the
declarants
had
immunity
at
trial,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
very
simple.
the
district
court...
a
pre-requisite
for
admitting
the
testimony
under
rule
804(b)(1)
was
that
the
declarants
be
found
to
be
unavailable.
and
they
were
found
to
be
unavailable
because
they
had
made
a
valid
assertion
of
privilege.
and
if...
they
had
been
immunized
at
the
time,
or
if
their
immunity
extended
to
trial
testimony,
they...
the
district
court
could
not
have
made
that
finding.
so
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
we
do.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
suggested
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
we
had
somehow
conceded
something
about
that.
but
that's,
i
think,
incorrect.
that
they...
in
the
court
of
appeals,
at
oral
argument,
we
did
state
that
we
were
authorized,
that
we
had
the
power,
and
that
the
trial
attorneys
had
the
power
to
grant
immunity
to
them
for
trial
testimony.
but
that
was
never
granted.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
form
of
the
immunity
grant
is,
i
think,
is
accurately
set
out,
as
he
quote...
as
the
respondents...
as
mr.
tigar
quoted
it
in
the
respondents'
brief.
but
that
was
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
could
be
a
further
proceeding.
and
if
the
government
wanted
to
immunize
them,
and
wanted
to
permit
the
immunity
to
carry
over
to
trial
it
could
have.
but
at
least
in
this
case,
it
was...
there
was
no
issue--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
was
a
grant
of...
there
was
a
grant
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think...
yeah,
i
think
that's
not
correct.
i
think
it
would
be
our
position
that
we
would
have
to
authorize
a
continued
use
of
that
immunity
for
any
of
the
future
proceedings
in
which
it
was
asserted.
the
fact
that
the
government
at
one
point
immunized
them
for
grand
jury
testimony
and
for
using
that
grand
jury
testimony
at
a
future
proceeding
does
not
mean
that
that
automatically
would
carry
over.
in
any
event,
that
was
an
issue
that,
i
think,
is...
it
was
decided
by
the
district
court
when
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no...
that
they
were
unavailable,
and
therefore
had
made
a
valid
assertion
of
privilege.
and
that
finding
was
not
disturbed
or
even
questioned
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
recall
whether
in
the
appellate
briefs...
i
don't
think
that
in
the
appellate
briefs
there
was
a
specific...
a
specific
argument
that
these
declarants
already
were
immunized.
but
i
don't...
i'm
reasonably
certain
of
that,
but
i
can't
state
it
positively.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
the
district
court
enters
an
immunity
order,
but
it
has
to
be
presented
to
the
court.
the
court...
the
government
has
to
move
with
an
appropriate
affidavit
to
the
district
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
guess
i'd
like
to
just
close
by
saying
that
mr.
tigar
suggested
that
where
the
government
goes
to
trial
on
a...
after
having
indicted
a
defendant,
it
has
to
pay
certain
costs.
unfortunately,
one
of
those
costs
is
not
wholesale
revision
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
government
is
as
entitled
to
rely
on
the
rules
at
trial
as
the
defendant
is.
rule
804(b)(1),
by
its
express
terms,
would
render
this
testimony
inadmissible.
and
therefore
we
believe
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
