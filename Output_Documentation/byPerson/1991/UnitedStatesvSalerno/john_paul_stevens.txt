justice
stevens
mr.
feldman,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
there?
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
different
ways
to
phrase
the
question:
one,
does
the
government
have
any
motive
at
all
to
show
that
the
witness
is
a
liar.
it
seems
to
me
they
clearly
had
a
motive,
but
maybe
that
motive
is
overcome
by
other
considerations.
is
the
fact
that
other
considerations
make
it
unwise
to
do
what
you
have
a
good
motive
to
do
destroy
the
existence
of
the
motive?
justice
stevens
well,
if
they
thought
they
were
lying,
and
that
there
really
was
this
conspiracy,
they
surely
had
a
motive.
maybe
they
didn't
want
to
go
ahead
and
do
it.
and
i...
it's
pretty
clear
from
the...
what
i
understand
the
facts
to
be,
they
did
think
these
people
were
lying.
justice
stevens
and
they
didn't
have
any
motive
to
show
that
perjurers
on
the
grand
jury
were
liars.
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
be
true.
there
may
be
reasons
not
to
go
forward
and
prove
they're
liars.
but
to
say
there's
a
total
absence
of
motive,
or
that
it's
not
similar
to
the
motive
at
trial,
i
find
very
difficult
to
understand.
justice
stevens
those
are
all
good
reasons.
but
do...
are
they
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
the
motive
was,
nevertheless,
there?
justice
stevens
could
you
also
just...
while
i've
interrupted
you...
comment
on
the
similarity
of
the
situation
for
a
defense...
a
witness
at
a
preliminary
hearing
where
the
defendant
decides,
for
tactical
reasons,
not
to
cross-examine?
is
there
a
similar
motive
there?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
raise
one
question?
of
course,
the
availability
issue
has
to
be
satisfied,
though,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
and,
of
course,
their
theory
was
that
the
witness
was
unavailable.
and
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
actually,
they
were
unavailable
to
the
defendant,
but
not
to
the
government,
was
their
theory.
justice
stevens
you
certainly
were
not
agreeing
with
justice
white
that
you
always
have
a
duty
to
tell
the
whereabouts
of
witnesses,
are
you?
justice
stevens
i
mean
you've
got
a
witness
protection
program
out
there,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
i
have
one
other
question,
mr.
tigar.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
if
you've
responded
to
it
or
not,
but
the
government
argues
that
the...
their
motive
in
maintaining
the
security
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
is
of
sufficient
importance
to
negate
the
similar-motive
requirement.
i
don't
think
you've
commented
on
their
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
justice
stevens
you
didn't
think
that
was
an
issue
before
the
court?
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
but
you
must
have
thought
there
was
an
issue
here,
or
you
wouldn't
have
argued
it.
justice
stevens
and
really,
we
don't
reach
the
issue
presented
by
the
question
in
the
certiorari
petition,
unless
we're
satisfied
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
similar
motive...
or
that
there
was
not
a
similar
motive.
