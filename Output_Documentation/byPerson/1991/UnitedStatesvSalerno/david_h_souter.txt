justice
souter
and
there
was
no
counter-argument
made
by
your
opposing
counsel
to
that
conclusion.
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
maybe
it
doesn't
matter,
but
is
it
your
position,
then,
that
the
reference
in
the
original
terms
of
the
immunity
to
further
proceedings
is
simply
surplusage?
justice
souter
why
is
it
there?
who's--
justice
souter
--who's
responsible
for
that?
i
mean,
this
will
betray
my
ignorance,
i'm
sure,
but
who
is
it
who
devises
these
terms?
is
it
you
or
the
district
court,
or
the
assistant
attorney
general?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
approve
a
request
for
immunity
on
these
terms?
justice
souter
i.e.,
including
the
terms
future
proceedings?
