justice
clarence
thomas
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
united
states
versus
salerno,
91-872.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
anthony
salerno
and
six
other
respondents
on
various
charges
including
racketeering
and
fraud.
the
indictment
alleged
that
they
have
attempted
to
rig
bids
on
construction
projects
in
new
york
city
by
controlling
the
supply
of
cement.
two
witnesses
provided
exculpatory
testimony
to
the
grand
jury,
but
they
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
and
refused
to
testify
at
trial.
the
respondents
asked
the
trial
court
to
admit
transcripts
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
into
evidence,
but
the
court
refused.
the
jury
later
convicted
the
respondents
of
various
federal
crimes.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
respondent's
conviction
on
ground
that
the
trial
court
should
have
admitted
the
transcripts.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk's
office,
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
federal
rule
of
evidence
804(b)
authorizes
admission
of
the
formal
testimony
of
unavailable
witnesses
but
only
when
the
opposing
party
had
a
similar
motive
to
develop
the
testimony
at
the
prior
hearing.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
whether
the
united
states
had
a
similar
motive
to
develop
the
statements
made
by
the
two
witnesses
at
the
grand
jury.
we
remand
the
case
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
consider
this
issue.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
