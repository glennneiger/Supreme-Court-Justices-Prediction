justice
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
the
district
court
found
the
government
did
not
have
a
similar
motive.
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
was
that
a
determination
that
there
was
no
similar
motive
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
o'connor
it
reads
as
though
the
district
court
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
never
would
be
a
similar
motive
at
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
what
do
you
think
they
decided?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it's
an
issue
of
fact?
justice
o'connor
and
so
on
a
case-by-case
basis
the
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
there
is
similar
motive.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
representation
that
as
to
the
witness
dematteis
that
the
immunity
extended
to
trial?
