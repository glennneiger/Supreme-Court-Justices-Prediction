justice
kennedy
have
the
circuit
courts
discussed
the
question
of
the
test
for
and
the
definition
of
similar
motive,
or
is
this
still
a
very
newly
emergent
doctrine?
justice
kennedy
if
the
government
decided
that
it
wanted
to
question
a
witness
extensively
in
order
to
lay
the
background
for
a
perjury
prosecution,
but
the
objectives
were...
and
the
course
of
questioning
was
the
same
as
would
be
pursued
in
the
trial,
is
that
a
similar
motive
or
a
different
motive?
justice
kennedy
did
the
defendant
have
the
precise
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
available
to
them?
justice
kennedy
they
just
had
information...
did
they
have
formal
communication
from
you
that
there
was
exculpatory
testimony?
justice
kennedy
your
position,
mr.
tigar,
is
that
the
government
opens
the
door
when
it
begins
cross-examination
in
the
grand
jury?
justice
kennedy
when
does
this
door
get
opened?
justice
kennedy
but
the
doctrine
about
opening
the
door
so
that
you
don't
take
an
inconsistent
position
before
the
same
trier
of
the
fact.
the
jury
never
heard
this
testimony.
justice
kennedy
the
trial
jury.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
still
having
trouble
opening
the
door.
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
candle
yet.
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
i
just...
i'm
aware
of
no
doctrine
of
opening
the
door
other
than
to
avoid
taking
an
inconsistent
position
before
a
trier
of
fact,
which
confuses
the
trier
of
fact.
that
did
not
happen
here.
justice
kennedy
cursory,
i
think.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it...
were
both
witnesses
called
at
the
trial
court
and
declined
to
testify?
justice
kennedy
well,
was
the
immunity
use
immunity?
justice
kennedy
but
was
the
use...
do
we
know
whether
the
use
immunity
was
confined
to
the
immunity...
to
the
testimony
that
was
developed
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
kennedy
was
there
a
grant
of
immunity
to
him
for
all
future
proceedings,
or
all
further
proceedings?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
a
trial
a
further
proceeding
in
relation
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
kennedy
i
thought
it
was
a
grant
of
immunity.
justice
kennedy
that
included
further
proceedings,
which
included
the
trial.
so
no
further
action
by
the
government
was
necessary
to
give
this
witness
immunity.
