justice
white
well,
if
you...
i
suppose...
i
suppose
the
government
would
have
to
tell
a
defendant
where
a
particular
witness
is,
if
the
defendant
didn't
know.
justice
white
but
if
the
witness
is
hiding
somewhere,
and
the
defendant
can't
find
him,
and
the
government
knows
where
he
is,
you
would
have
to
tell,
i
suppose?
justice
white
well,
is
it
a
brady
obligation
or
not?
justice
white
you
mean
not
always.
you
wouldn't
have
to
always
tell
them
where
the
witness
is.
justice
white
well,
you
don't
think
that's
somewhat
similar
to
this
situation?
the
government
just
doesn't
want
to
immunize
this
person.
justice
white
yes,
but
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
case.
you
may
present
that
reason,
but
we're
not
required
to
even
recognize
it.
justice
white
yes,
i
agree.
justice
white
i
agree
with
you.
we
don't
ordinarily
indulge
in
it.
[laughter]
justice
white
but
this
wasn't
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on.
justice
white
well,
are
you
defending
that
or
not?
justice
white
well,
i
think
you
better
get
with
that
for
a
while.
justice
white
i
take
it
your
bottom
line
is
if
we...
the
government's
position
really
requires
a
decision
on
whether
the
rule
is
constitutional.
justice
white
and
it
isn't,
you
would
say?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
i
take
it
you...
you
weren't...
you
don't
think
we're
entitled
to
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
similar
motive?
and
i
would
think
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
would...
would
obtain,
and
they
would
have
reached
the
same
result
if
they
came
right
out
and
says...
there
was
no...
we
find
there
was
no
similar
motive
on
the
part
of
the
government.
but
nevertheless,
they've
got
the
choice.
they're
either
immunizing
or
letting
the
testimony
in.
that's
what
they
eventually
said.
you
either
immunize
or
let
the
evidence
in
and
ignore
the
rule.
justice
white
all
right.
anyway,
we
are
entitled,
then,
to
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
government
had
no
similar
motive.
justice
white
why?
justice
white
i
know
but
we're
reviewing
a
court
of
appeals'
decision.
we
don't
spend
our
time
correcting
errors,
here.
i
mean
chief
justice
taft
said
two
courts
is
enough
for
correcting
errors.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
an
important
question
of
law,
not
to
revise
the
judgment
in
this
particular
case.
justice
white
but
to
do
that,
we
have
to
read
that
entire
bundle
of
papers
you've
just
thrown
on
your
desk
there.
justice
white
right?
yes.
justice
white
yes,
i
know
you
do.
