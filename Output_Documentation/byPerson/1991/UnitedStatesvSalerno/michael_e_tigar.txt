mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
hold
in
my
hand
nearly
400
pages
of
grand
jury
transcript,
first
released
to
us
after
certiorari
was
granted:
280
pages
of
mr.
dematteis,
including
10
separate
document
requests,
with
which
he
complied;
and
75
pages
of
mr.
bruno,
under
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
this
is
the
testimony
of
which
the
government
said
we
didn't
have
a
similar
motive
and,
in
fact,
we
didn't
develop
it.
these
witnesses
were
confronted
in
the
grand
jury
with
every,
single,
key
witness
that
was
to
testify
at
trial.
an
indictment
had
already
been
issued
in
this
very
case.
it
was
a
superseding
one
that
came
out
afterward.
they
were
confronted
with
a
key
wiretap
of
skopol,
who
was
the
central
declarant
in
the
alleged
conspiracy.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
with
this
testimony,
if
it
was
believed
by
the
jury,
there
was
no
conspiracy.
because
these
witnesses
were
key
oligopsonist
players
in
the
receipt
of
concrete
from
the
trucks,
and
key
oligopolistic
players
in
the
alleged
bid-rigging.
and
without
them,
of
course,
there
couldn't
be
a
conspiracy.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
under
the
question
presented,
justice
scalia,
the
answer
is
clearly
yes,
because
the
question
presented
misstates
the
rule.
the
rule--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--yes.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
justice
scalia,
it's
an
easy
case
on
the
question
presented
because
the
rule
doesn't
require
a
motive
to
cross-examine,
it
requires
a
motive
to
develop
the
testimony.
your
question
to
mr.
feldman
illustrates
this.
this
rule
jettisons
the
common
law
requirement
of
identity
of
parties,
and
substitutes
the
much
more
supple
concept
of
similar
motive.
second,
justice
scalia,
as
cited
in
our
brief,
we're
entitled
to
defend
our
judgment
on
any
ground...
whether
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
not.
and
the
government
brought
this
case
here
telling--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
court
has
the
power,
justice
white--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--to
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
comfortable
with
the
merits.
but
i
wish
to
make
clear
that
the
government,
in
its
certiorari
petition,
filed
at
a
time
when
we
didn't
have
this
material,
described
the
case
as
though
it
had
had
no
motive
before
the
grand
jury
to
talk
about
these
wiretaps
and
to
reveal
its
investigation.
after
certiorari
was
granted
and
we
got
the
facts
for
the
first
time,
we
learned
that
these
things
did,
indeed,
happen
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
well
the
ground
that
the--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
do
defend
that,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
sir.
i
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
its
own
terms
as
follows:
for
25
years
at
the
bar,
the
most
uncomfortable
thing
a
judge
has
ever
said
to
me,
and
it's
happened
a
lot
of
times,
is
leaning
over
the
bench,
in
a
tone
of
voice
used
by
cats
to
explain
to
canaries
the
meaning
of
dinner,
the
judge
says,
mr.
tigar,
you
have
opened
the
door.
that
is
to
say,
mr.
tiger,
evidence
that
you
might
be
able
to
block
the
admission
of
is
not
going
to
come
in
because
you
have
done
things,
or
said
things,
or
suffered
things
to
be
done
at
or
said
that
make...
mean
that
you
can't
rely
on
it.
now
you
could
go,
for
these
purposes,
to
rule
104(a),
which
requires
a
preliminary
fact-kind-of
determination
and
say
that
that's
the
rules
of
evidence
equivalent
to
37(a),
and
use
the
same
analysis
you
did
in
insurance
company
of
ireland
v.
companie
de
boxie
de
guinea,
saying
essentially
that
the
personal
jurisdiction
issue
is
pretermitted,
we
don't
have
to
get
to
it.
here
the
second
circuit
said...
and
it
explained
it
clearly
and
narrowly.
it's
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
quoting
from
their
opinion
in
bahadar,
that
we
concluded
in
salerno
that
it...
i.e.,
similar
motive...
could
not
be
invoked
by
the
government
under
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
when
the
second
circuit
so
spoke,
it
did
so
having
in
its
hands
something
that
we
did
not...
that
is,
these
nearly
400
pages.
when
we
look
at
them
we
see
that
the
second
circuit
was
right,
that
the
adversarial
fairness
goal
is
met
here.
the
court
in
jones
against
illinois...
justice
white,
justice
scalia,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
excuse
me...
also
addressed
this
question.
nothing
is
more
sacred,
i
suppose,
then
defending
the
constitution.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
means
to
do
that.
but
if
the
accused
opens
the
door,
then
it
comes
in.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
if
the--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
the
government's
position
is
accepted,
justice
white;--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
this
adversarial
fairness
doctrine,
which
is
routinely
used
is
not
invoked,
it
is
unconstitutional.
let
me
turn
to
that.
in
chambers
against
mississippi--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--yes,
it
was,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
didn't
want
to
reach
the
constitutional
issued
posed
by
this
very
issue
unless
it
had
to,
and
so
it
resolved
the
issue
based
on
the
concept
of
adversarial
fairness.
we
briefed
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
responded
to
it
in
its
opinion.
and
it
is
fairly
presented
by
this
record,
sir.
in
chambers
against
mississippi,
the
court
held
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
hearsay
give
way
under
certain
circumstances.
then
in
ohio
v.
roberts,
the
court
explained
what
it
meant.
and
then
this
term,
in
white
v.
illinois
it
took
the
analysis
a
step
further.
you
remember,
in
ohio
v.
roberts,
defense
counsel,
the
hapless,
poor
fellow,
went
outside
and
he
got
anita
isaacs
in,
and
he
put
her
on
direct
examination
to
try
to
wheedle
exculpatory
testimony
out
of
her
but
it
didn't
work.
that
happens
to
defense
lawyers
in
preliminary
examinations.
that
derisory
encounter
on
direct
examination
was
held
to
be
such
a
similar
motive,
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
not
violated.
again,
i
contrast
it
with
these
400
pages.
the
court
then
said
some
interesting
things.
first,
cross-examination/direct-examination
doesn't
matter.
i
think
that
answers
justice
scalia's
question.
the
motive
doesn't
have
to
be
very
much,
and
it
can
be
direct
as
well
as
cross.
and
that's
what
the
drafters
of
the
rule
thought.
second,
the
district
judge's
opinion...
justice
o'connor,
you
had
asked
whether
it
was
a
decision
of
law
or
fact.
if
you
look
at
her
opinion,
she
said
a
prosecutor
doesn't
have
a
motive.
she
spoke
in
general.
and
then
in
two
paragraphs
further
on,
she
did
something
that
gives
it
away.
she
said
i
got
some
letters
from
the
government
that
say
these
people
aren't
reliable.
well,
in
white
against
illinois,
and
in
ohio
v.
roberts,
this
court
said
for
government
hearsay,
that
doesn't
matter.
we
don't
take
letters
over
the
transom
or
under
the
door
that
the
hearsay
declarant's
not
a
nice
person.
if
the
requirements
of
the
rule
are
met...
here,
cross-examination
and
the
development
of
the
testimony...
the
most
reliable,
according
to
wigmore
and
all
of
the
commentators,
or,
if
in
white
v.
illinois
the
excited
utterance
standard
is
met,
that's
the
end
of
it.
we
don't
take
a
letter
under
the
transom
that
says
that
the
excited
utterer
declarant,
you
know,
robbed
a
grocery
store
last
week.
that
can
be
shown
under
rule
806
so
that
the
government
has
a
fair
opportunity
to
do,
even
without
granting
immunity,
that
which
it
says
it
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
do.
that's--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--no,
justice
kennedy,
we
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
door
is
opened,
one...
and
the
court
of
appeals
went
through
this
in
bahadar,
so
i'm
not
making
it
up
as
i
go
along.
it's
in
the
record.
first,
they
went
to
washington,
d.c.
and
got
an
assistant
attorney
general
to
certify
that
this
testimony
was
necessary
in
the
public
interest...
not
their
private
interest,
the
public
interest.
they
put
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury.
it
very
quickly
turned
out
that
the
witnesses
weren't
going
to
tell
the
government's
story.
ten
document
requests
later,
they
let
them
go.
so
the
door
opening,
justice
kennedy,
was
the
grant
of
immunity,
and
the
extensive
cross-examination
and
document
requests
and
the
rest
of
it--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
inconsistent
position,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--is
that
the
government
indicted
these
defendants
and
said,
members
of
the
trial
jury,
there
is
a
conspiracy
here
to
rig
bids.
now,
at
the
same
time
they're
telling
the
jury
that,
in
the
back
room,
they
have
lit
a
candle...
the
candle
of
the
exculpatory
testimony
of
these
witnesses.
and
now
they
want
from
this
court
the
authority
to
put
a
basket
over
that
candle,
so
the
light
doesn't
shine
in
the
dark
corners.
that
is--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
apologize
for
the...
i
apologize
to
the...
for
the
metaphor,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
door-opening
concept...
for
example,
in
cases
like
walder
and
jones,
the
accused's
statements
are
suppressed.
they're
kept
away.
the
accused
then
says
something
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
position.
here
the
inconsistency
is
that
the
government
claims
in
its
case
that
a
crime
occurred,
and
it's
holding
in
the
background,
and
keeping
out
of
evidence
the
testimony
or
statements
of
others
that
it
didn't
occur.
that
was
the
situation
in
chambers
v.
mississippi.
the
constitutional
concept
there...
and
that
rose
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation...
was
that
mcdonald's
confession,
which
directly,
as
the
court
found
negated
the
theory
on
which
they
were
prosecuting,
was
such
that
was
required
to
come
in.
in
andolschek,
cited
with
approval
by
this
court;
in
dennis
v.
united
states,
there
were
treasury
regulations
that
barred
certain
evidence,
that
kept
it
from
being
used.
and
the
second
circuit,
cited
with
approval,
said
look.
we...
the
government's
right
to
be
let
alone
and
to
keep
its
secrets
is
fine.
but
once
you
prosecute,
there
are
certain
prices
that
you
have
to
pay.
and
one
of
those
prices
is
that
you
open
the
door
to
evidence
that
meets
certain
levels
of
reliability...
just
like
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
mine.
i
can
use
it
to
bar
the
introduction
of
relevant
evidence...
the
most...
perhaps
the
most
relevant.
but
the
bar
comes
down
when
i
abuse
that
procedural
right...
not
abuse
it...
when
i
press
it
to
a
certain
distance.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
does
not.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that's
not
the
choice.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
grant
of
immunity
to
dematteis,
which
is
the
only
one
that
we
have
in
the
record...
the
other
one's
sealed...
says
that
he
was
immunized
for
the
grand
jury
and
for
any
subsequent
trial.
the
government
didn't
tell
us
that
in
the
district
court.
but
they
had
already
given
him
immunity.
so
that
on
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
they'd
already
crossed
the
immunity
bridge.
but
i
will
answer
the
court's
question
straight
out.
are
there
circumstances
in
which
the
government
is
compelled
to
set
aside
this
executive
prerogative...
not
a
circumstance
presented
by
this
case?
yes,
there
are.
in
lefkowitz
v.--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--that's
right.
it's
not
necessary
to
the
decision,
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
i'm
not
running
from
it,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
in
lefkowitz
v.
cunningham--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i'm
saying
three
things:
first,
i
made
my
constitutional
argument...
that
is
to
say
that...
justice
white,
as
usual,
said
it
better
than
i
did,
formulating
the
issue,
that
the
rule
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
the
way
the
government
wants.
second,
we
support
the
second
circuit's
position.
in
this
case,
given
these
transcripts,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
see
how
the
government
could
ask
anything
they
didn't
already
get
to
ask.
so
the
question
is
hypothetical.
but
there's
a
third
point
here.
and
that
is,
the
government
in
its
brief
tells
the
court...
and
it
stands
up
here
and
tells
the
court...
that
even
looking
at
804(b)(1),
we
don't
think
that
grand
jury
testimony
should
come
in
hardly
ever.
we
won't
say
never,
but
hardly
ever.
sorry
to
mix
the
metaphor
again.
maybe
gilbert
and
sullivan
don't
belong
here.
but
that
is
their
position.
and
i
want
to
spend
a
couple
of
minutes
talking
about
that.
this
hearsay,
this
prior
testimony
is
the
strongest
hearsay.
that
is,
wigmore,
and
all
the
commentators
have
said
it.
the
rule
drafters
considered
making
it
not
hearsay
at
all.
again,
to
return
to
justice
scalia's
question,
the
similar
motive
requirement
does
perhaps
invoke
a
question
of
degree.
but
there
are
so
many
cases
about
similar
motive
out
there
in
the
wake
of
the
rules...
many,
many,
many...
that
show
that
the
motive
can
be
relatively
derisory.
and
i'll
tell
you
if
i...
i
think
after
25
years,
if
i
showed
up
at
a
preliminary
hearing
and
had
a
witness
on
the
stand
for
3
days
and
made
10
document
requests
to
the
witness,
and
then
put
another
one
on
for
a
day
with
a
subpoena
duces
tecum,
i'd
pretty
well
expect
to
see
that
testimony
coming
back
against
my
client,
if
the
witness
turned
up
unavailable
later
on.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
oh,
derisory...
i
am
thinking
of
the
anita
isaacs
episode
in
ohio
v.
roberts,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
witness
out
in
the
hall
who
lived
with
the
defendant,
herschel
roberts.
defense
counsel...
because
i
read
the
court's
opinion...
gets
a
bright
idea
that
maybe
ms.
isaacs
will
say
that
mr.
roberts
could
have
thought
he
had
authority
to
use
her
parents'
credit
cards
during
the
time
they
were
living
together.
so
he...
with
no
preparation,
apparently...
drags
her
in,
puts
her
on
the
stand,
and
starts
questioning
her
on
direct.
she
turns
on
him,
and
bites
his
hand.
she
won't
give
him
what
he
thinks
he's
going
to
get,
and
he
doesn't
even
ask
to
have
her
declared
a
hostile
witness.
he
just
quits.
she
turns
up
missing.
this
court
says,
well,
she's
unavailable,
the
hearsay
comes
in.
we
don't
need
to
worry
whether
she's
a
nice
person,
not
a
nice
person.
she
was
under
oath
and
you
had
your
chance,
and
that's
it.
that's
the
derisory
kind
of
encounter...
i
hope
i'm
using
the
right
word...
it's
a
relatively
insignificant
encounter
that
nonetheless
satisfies
the
similar
motive
requirement.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i'm
sorry.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
i...
and
i
accept
that
change.
the
unremarkable
nature
of
this
opinion,
considered
as
a
question
of
804(b)(1)
is
illustrated
by
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
we
cite
in
our
brief.
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
united
states
v.
miller,
judge
silberman
for
the
court,
then
judge
thomas
on
the
panel,
said
that
the
notion
of
letting
in
grand
jury
testimony
under
these
circumstances
is
well
accepted,
well
established
in
our
jurisprudence,
was
the
words
that
they
used.
and
i
think
that
follows.
it
follows.
the
grand
jury,
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
held,
is
the
government's
playground
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
been
hesitant
to
impose
restrictions
on
government
conduct
that
are
going
to
interfere
with
the
grand
jury's
ongoing
function.
but
once
they
have
summoned
a
witness
and
elicited
the
testimony
at
such
length,
the
purposes
of
rule
804(b)(1)
are
met.
and
again,
this
is
the
transcript.
this
shows
that
the
abstract
concerns
the
government
raised
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
simply
don't
exist
here.
and
there
is
a
final
point
about
this.
as
saltzburg
and
martin
in
their
treatise
on
the
law
of
evidence
tell
us
what
prosecutors
do,
and
this
court
has
seen
it
in
other
cases,
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
watt
v.
indiana,
ought
not
as
justices
to
forget
that's
what
you
knew
as
men...
and
he
would
say
as
women,
today.
that
is
that
the
prosecutor,
knowing
that
there
is
a
witness
out
there,
doesn't
know
which
way
they're
going
to
go.
are
they
going
to
give
testimony
that
inculpates
the
defendants...
who
they've
already
indicted,
by
the
way...
or
they
going
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy?
if
the
former,
fine.
they'll
get
their
testimony.
but
if
the
latter,
the
prosecutor
keeps
him
before
the
grand
jury
because
you
can
develop
impeachment
material.
that
way,
when
the
defendant
calls
on
the
trial
as
witnesses,
you've
got
this
rucksack
full
of
things
that
you
developed
in
secret
in
the
grand
jury
context.
to
take
the
matter
a
step
further...
and
in
conclusion,
if
there
are
no
more
questions...
mr.
juliani
was
the
united
states
attorney.
would
he
believe
for
a
minute,
hypothetically,
a
prosecutor
who
said,
oh,
i
had
some
of
the
major
players
in
the
new
york
concrete
industry
in
the
grand
jury
today.
i
had
them
there
in
secret.
i
had
them
there
without
their
lawyers.
i
had
them
there
under
grants
of
immunity
that
i
got
from
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
but
i
just
decided
that
i
wasn't
going
to
ask
them
any
questions.
i
really
didn't
have
a
motive
that
day
to
ask
them
anything
about
the
most
significant
bid-rigging
conspiracy
in
the
history
of
the
city
of
new
york.
just
as
i
could
not...
and
no
lawyer
in
this
court
could
argue
with
a
straight
face...
the
testimony
developed
under
these
circumstances
now
before
the
court
would
come
in
at
some
subsequent
proceeding.
i
respectfully
submit
that
doesn't
pass
the
straight-face
test.
if
the
court
has
no--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
their...
we
would
not
say
that
in
every
case
grand
jury
testimony
comes
in.
we
would
say
that
this
hearsay,
which
is
the
most
reliable
kind
of
hearsay...
developed
before
the
grand
jury,
which
is
the
public's
body
and
not
the
prosecution's
playground,
ought
presumptively
to
come
in.
and
that
if
the
government
has
a
special
reason,
in
terms
of
grand
jury
secrecy,
to
prevent
it
coming
in...
i
think
the
flaw
here,
as
suggested
by
some
of
the
questions
is
that
the
defendants
were
forced
to
put
a
blindfold
on
to
argue
about
it.
that
is,
they
were
necessarily
dealing
in
hypotheticals
because
they
didn't
have
the
testimony.
so
that
to
answer
the
question
to
begin
with,
procedurally,
as
you
do
under
the
jencks
act,
in
what's
called
a
campbell
hearing,
there
ought
to
be
some
disclosure.
as
the
court
said
in
alderman
v.
united
states,
you
could
even
put
it
under
protective
order.
and
there
the
matters
were
the
most
sensitive
wiretaps,
bearing
upon
national
security
and
espionage
case,
co-petitioner
ivanof.
so
that
adversary
inquiry
might
illuminate
the
matter
and
show
that
under
particular
circumstances
there
was
no
motive.
but
it's
difficult
to
argue
about
in
this
case
because
there
had
already
been
one
indictment
in
a
related
case;
one
indictment
in
this
case;
and
in
fact,
looking
here,
they
did
disclose
the
name
of
every
single
major
witness
in
the
case,
and
the
name
of
the
most
significant
declarant,
through
one
of
these
wiretaps.
coming
back
to...
this
is
not
the
case
that
was
represented
in
the
certiorari
petition.
but
generally
speaking,
i
think
the
court
should
be
skeptical
of
the
government's
assertions,
just
as
it
has
been
skeptical
of
the
defense
counsel
who
stands
up
here
in
the
well
of
the
court
and
says
well,
it
was
just
a
preliminary
hearing,
i
didn't
really
have
the
motive
to
do
anything.
and
all
of
us
that
had
done
preliminary
hearings
know
that
you
don't
have
a
motive
to
do
anything.
except
that
the
court
has
said,
i'm
sorry,
your
tactical
considerations
here
are
really
not
our
concern,
counsel.
you'd
better
understand
that
when
you
start
asking
questions
you
may
see
this
coming
back.
so
that...
that
is
my
answer.
but
at
bottom,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
grand
jury.
it's
not
just
their
playground.
it
is
a
body
that
gives
them
the
power
to
investigate...
the
sole
inquisitorial
element
in
our
accusatorial
system
of
jurisprudence.
and
as
in
andolschek,
when
they
then
decide
to
indict
somebody...
as
the
court
has
often
recognized...
these
considerations
evaporate.
the
very
case
that
they
cite
discussing
grand
jury
secrecy
shows
why
that's
so.
all
of
the
court's
decisions
on
grand
jury
secrecy...
the
list
of
factors
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
are
satisfied
here
in
terms
of
there
not
being
any
reason
for
nondisclosure.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
what
it
said
was
it
assumed,
arguendo,
that
the...
there
was
no
similar
motive
to,
quote,
cross-examine,
close
quote.
so
the
district
court...
which,
of
course,
is
not
the
rule
standard.
moreover,
the
district
judge...
excuse
me,
i'm
corrected
by
co-counsel...
he
says
there
may
have
been
no
motive...
may
have
been.
which
is
either
a
conditional
or
assuming
arguendo.
but
in
any
case,
doesn't
meet
the
requirement.
the
decision
they
were
reviewing,
as
i
had
said
earlier,
is
not
a
factual
finding
by
the
district
court.
it's
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
scalia,
if
the
court
believes...
now
that
the
record
has
seen
the
light
of
day...
that
the
court
of
appeals...
if
this
court
believes
the
court
of
appeals'
utterance
is
as
delphic
as
is
suggested
by
your
question,
then
the
proper
course
would
be
to
remand,
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
what
it
would
have
done
were
all
of
this
testimony
now
in
the
light
of
day
so
that
it
could
really
be
argued
about.
but
given
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
a
fact-finding
by
the
district
judge,
whose
opinion
is
bereft
of
factual
finding
and
entirely
based
on
the
law,
and
given
the
court
of
appeals'
refusal
to
endorse
the
district
judge...
given
its
opinion
as
a
whole,
sharply
critical
of--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
white,
it
is
our
position
that
they
did
not
say
ignore
the
rule,
that
they
said
that
the
bar
of
the
rule
cannot
be
relied
on
by
the
government
under
these
circumstances,
as
often
happens.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
indeed,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
because
the
record
of
this
case
contains
the
indisputable
evidence
of
the
way
in
which
they
developed
the
testimony.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
and
i
respectfully
suggest,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
said
in
my
brief,
that
the
theoretical
statements
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
about
the
interests
of
the
government
turn
out
to
evaporate
when
you
look
at
this
testimony.
and
that
the
most
appropriate
disposition
is
to
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted
because
the
facts
brought
to
this
court
by
the
government
fall
so
far
short
of
what
it
has
said
they
were,
or
suggested
that
they
were...
excuse
me,
let
me
be
precise...
suggested
that
they
were
in
bringing
the
case
here.
yes,
that
is
also
our
position.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
government--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
invite
the
court
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
but
the
government
has
not
challenged
my
summary
of
it
in
my
brief,
and
therefore
i
think
that
the
court
can
rely
on
what
was
said
there.
after
all,
they
also
admitted,
at
page
11
of
their
reply
brief
that
they
did
cross-examine
enough
to
bring
a
perjury
prosecution.
and
i
heard
them
say
in
oral
argument
that
that
would
have
been
enough
of
a
similar
motive.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
other...
yes.
the
other--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--well,
the
government
admitted
in
oral
argument
in
the
second
circuit
that
neither
witness
was
unavailable.
that
transcript
has
just
been
released,
too.
i
don't
know
why
he
is
unavailable,
justice
scalia.
i
didn't
have
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
that
contained
the
text
of
the
immunity
order
at
the
time
i
argued
in
the
second
circuit.
i
was
compelled
to
feel
around
and
make
hypothetical
arguments.
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
the
more
that
gets
revealed,
the
less
there
appears
to
be
the
cosmic
legal
issue
that
was
tendered
by
the
petitioner.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
know
that
that
form
of
grant
of
immunity
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
given
the
express
holding
of
the
miller
case,
would
have
been
enough
to
carry
through
to
trial.
that,
the
d.c.
circuit
made
clear
in
that
case.
whether
it
would
be
sufficient
in
other
circuits
is
a
question
on
which
i
don't
think
the
circuits
themselves
have
a
consistent
view.
but
at
any
rate
it
shows
why
the
government's
legal
theory
keeps
getting
tangled
up
with
the
facts.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
both
witnesses
were
called
an
invoked
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
at
that
time
the
government
didn't
say
a
word
about
the
terms
of
the
earlier
grants
of
immunity.
now,
maybe
they
put
them
under
seal
and
gave
them
to
the
district
judge.
but
so
far
as
the
public
record
that
was
in
the
trial
court,
they
weren't
there.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
it
was
for
statutory
immunity,
approved
by
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
as
required
by
the
statute.
and
that's
made
clear
in
all
these
transcripts,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
terms
of
the
immunity
grant,
as
read
to
the
witness,
dematteis,
include
all
proceedings
resulting
therefrom
or
ancillary
thereto.
i
don't
have
in
the
transcript
of
bruno
the
text
of
the
order.
in
supplemental
record
number
1,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
are
three,
handwritten
notations
of
envelopes
that
were
sealed.
that
same
record
index
is
in
this
court,
and
contains,
i
believe,
the
same
material.
at
page
117
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
second
circuit,
that
representation
was
made
to
that
court.
so
those
are
available.
