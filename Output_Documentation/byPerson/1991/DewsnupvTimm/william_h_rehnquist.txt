chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-741,
aletha
dewsnup
v.
louis
timm.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
they
leave
the
courtroom.
the
court
is
still
in
session.
mr.
dyk,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dyk,
did
you
say
a
moment
ago
that
under
the
act
of
1898
and
the
chandler
act,
the
pre-code,
that
it
was
unclear
what
happened
to
liens?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
doesn't
have
the
same
choice
he
did
under
the
pre-code
bankruptcy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
is
a
misvaluation,
supposing
the
bankruptcy
court
says
the
property
is
worth
$50,000,
it
turns
out
it's
later
sold
without
any
interim
improvements
for
$125,000.
which
value
prevails?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dyk.
mr.
taranto,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taranto,
would
you
state
again
what
everybody
agrees
506(d)
accomplishes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
long
against
bullard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
incentive
for
a
creditor
to
bifurcate
his
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the...
for
general
creditors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
mann,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
this
all
kind
of...
you
give
the
impression,
mr.
mann,
this
is
all
kind
of
optional,
that
well
maybe
it
could
be,
maybe
it
couldn't...
the
statute
doesn't
provide
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
enough
about
bankruptcy
practice
to
know
what
sort
of
a
hearing
this
initial
valuation
is?
do
the
parties
call
expert
appraisal
witnesses?
or
is
it
just
a
kind
of
a
seat-of-the-pants
type
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
mr.
dyk,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
15
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
almost
built
into
the
statute,
that
difficulty,
from
the
way
everybody
says
the
initial
valuation
controls,
even
though
the
foreclosure
sale
produces
a
much
different
price.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
still
have
judicial
error.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dyk,
was
the
louisville
joint
stock
bank
a
bifurcation
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
a
sitting-out
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dyk.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-741,
dewsnup
against
timm
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
