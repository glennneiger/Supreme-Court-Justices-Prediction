mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
important
question
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
namely
whether
liens
that
exceed
the
value
of
property
in
bankruptcy
are
to
be
avoided
under
section
506.
the
present
bankruptcy
is
a
chapter
7
bankruptcy,
a
liquidation
bankruptcy
in
which
the
assets
of
the
debtor
are
generally
sold
to
pay
the
claims
of
creditors.
but
the
interpretation
has
significance
also
for
the
reorganization
chapters,
chapters
11
and
13,
which
deal
with
business
and
consumer
reorganizations.
before
the
1978
code,
the
status
of
secured
creditors
in
bankruptcy
was
somewhat
unclear.
incredibly
enough,
chapters
11
and
13
under
the
old
code
did
not
deal
with
secured
creditors
and,
even
in
a
liquidation
bankruptcy,
the
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
on
a
lien
was
unclear.
what
congress
did
was
to
enact
section
506.
the
two
sections
of
506
that
are
relevant
here
today
are
section
506(a)
and
section
506(d).
there
is
really
no
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
interpretation
of
section
506(a).
section
506(a)
deals
with
allowed
claims,
that
is,
claims
which
are
approved
or
otherwise
come
into
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
which
are
not
disallowed
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it
was
unclear.
there
were
essentially
three
situations.
this
was
discussed
to
some
extent
in
the
chase...
this
court's
decision
in
the
chase
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
under
long
v.
bullard,
the
creditor...
the
secured
creditor
could
choose
to
ignore
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
entirely
and
the
lien
would
survive
the
bankruptcy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
secured
creditor
went
into
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
proved
his
claim
to
the
full
amount,
he
would
have
waived
his
lien.
the
situation
that
was
unclear
was
when
under
57(h),
for
example,
a
secured
creditor
went
into
bankruptcy
and
tried
to
prove
part
of
his
claim;
that
is,
the
claim
that
exceeded
the
value
of
the
property.
and
i
think
it
was
unclear,
and
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondents
or
the
united
states
really
deals
with
this
situation...
unclear
in
that
situation
what
happened
to
the
excess
lien.
our
suggestion
is
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
506
was
to
deal
with
that.
what
506(a)
does
is
to
divide
this
claim
of
a
secured
creditor
into
two
parts.
part
one
is
to
the
extent
that
there
is
value
in
the
property.
the
creditor
has
an
allowed
secured
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
that
phrase
is
not
only
used
in
section
506
but
in
various
other
sections
of
the
code
as
well.
then
section
506(a)
also
says
to
the
extent
that
the
lien
exceeds
the
value
of
the
property,
that
the
creditor
has
an
allowed
unsecured
claim.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
he
does
have
the
option
to
stay
out
of
the
bankruptcy,
but
there
is
a
new
provision
in
the
'78
code,
section
501(c),
which
allows
the
trustee
or
the
debtor
to
force
the
secured
creditor
into
bankruptcy
and
to--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
he
has
a
choice,
but
it's
not
just
his
choice.
if
he
stays
out
of
the
bankruptcy,
the
trustee
or
the
debtor
can
override
that
and
bring
him
in.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
and
that
was
an
important
part
of
the
1978
code,
was
to
bring
the
secured
creditors
into
the
bankruptcy
to
deal
with
their
claims
and
to
avoid
these
wandering
liens
which
might
exist
to
the
extent
that
the
lien
exceeded
the
value
of
the
property.
now
there
is
no
question
about
this
bifurcation
into
the
secured
claim
and
the
unsecured
claim
that's
accomplished
by
506(a).
and
i
think
there's
no
dispute
that
506(a)
applies
to
property
that
will
be
abandoned
or
has
been
abandoned
just
as
it
must
apply
to
exempt
property.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
506(a)
provides
for
a
hearing
to
determine
the
value.
most
courts
have
said
that
the
value,
i
think,
is
to
be
determined
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
and
the
court
sets
the
value
and
that
then
determines
what
the
secured
claim
is
allowed...
the
secured
claim
is
and
what
the
allowed
unsecured
claim
is.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
that's
true,
and
there
is
a
contention
here
that
allowing
the
debtor
to
keep
any
increase
in
the
case
of
abandoned
property
creates
an
unfairness.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
property
may
go
up
in
value
is
that
the
debtor
has
continued
to
make
improvements
on
the
property,
planted
crops
in
the
case
of
farmland,
or
something
like
that.
it
is
also
possible,
of
course,
that
the
market
has
changed
or
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
misvalued
the
property.
but
i
think
the
opposing
parties
concede
that
that
kind
of
misvaluation
doesn't
happen
very
often.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
there
is
only
a
provision
for
the
setting
of
one
value
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
and
the
first
value
would
prevail.
but
of
course,
the
creditor
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
if
you
have
property
which
has
no
value
to
the
estate,
can
move
for
the
lifting
of
the
automatic
stay.
and
that
would
allow
the
creditor
to
immediately
foreclose
on
the
property.
so
there
need
not
be
any
time
difference
between
the
valuation
and
the
actual
sale.
there
was
another
concern,
and
i
think
it's
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
is
that
if
the
creditor
could
keep
the
lien
to
the
excess
value,
he
could
in
essence
coerce
the
debtor
to
give
him
more
than
he
might
otherwise
be
entitled
to.
that
is
true
because
property
often
has
more
value
to
the
person
who
was
using
it
than
to
a
third-party
purchaser.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
there's
always
a
tension
between
the
debtor
and
the
lienholder.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
lienholder
bargained
for
that,
but
the
idea
of
bankruptcy
is
to
discharge
some
of
these
debts
as
personal
liabilities
and
to
enable
the
parties
to
go
forward.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
senior
lienholder
and
a
junior
lienholder,
if
the
junior
lien
is
worthless,
this
provision
allows
the
elimination
of
that
junior
lien
so
that
the
debtor
can
negotiate
with
the
senior
creditor
and
work
out
a
plan
for
repayment
over
a
period
of
time.
if
you
allow
the
lien
to
wander
around
in
secured
claims,
you
have
all
sorts
of
problems.
one
of
those
problems
is
if
the
creditor
in
the
bankruptcy
has
secured
a
payment
on
this
second
half
of
the
claim,
the
allowed
unsecured
claim.
then
what
happens?
let's
assume
that
we
have
a
piece
of
property
that's
with
a
$150
lien
on
it;
it's
worth
$100.
that
means
that
under
this
provision
of
the
code,
that
there's
a
secured
claim
for
$100
and
an
unsecured
claim
for
$50.
well,
what
happens
if
the
creditor
in
the
bankruptcy
secures
a
distribution
from
the
estate
of
an
additional
$25
on
the
unsecured
claim?
under
the
proposal
that
the
opposing
parties
make
here,
there
isn't
any
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
code
to
deal
with
that.
does
the
creditor
keep
the
$150
lien
even
though
he's
already
been
paid
part
of
his
unsecured
claim,
or
what
happens?
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
under
the
attorney
general's
interpretation,
the
only
part
of
the
lien...
the
only
time
that
a
lien
would
be
avoided
under
506(d)
is
if
it
were
a
disallowed
claim.
that
cannot
have
been
what
congress
meant
in
the
statute.
what
the
united
states
attempts
to
do
and
what
the
respondents
attempt
to
do
is
to
divorce
section
506(d)
from
section
506(a).
what
they
are
saying
essentially
is
even
though
506(a)
bifurcates
the
claims
into
secured
claims
and
unsecured
claims,
that
the
lien
continues
with
respect
to
the
unsecured
claim.
and
it
continues
after
bankruptcy
and
can
be
enforced
against
any
appreciation.
but
that's
not
what
506(d)
provided.
it
said
that
liens
are
void
to
the
extent
that
they
secure
claims
which
are
not
allowed
secured
claims,
which
includes
two
categories.
it
includes
claims
that
are
disallowed,
and
it
includes
claims
that
are
allowed
unsecured
claims.
it's
almost
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
wished
to
continue
a
lien
with
respect
to
a
claim
that
it
had
characterized
as
an
allowed
unsecured
claim
and
treat
it
in
that
respect
throughout
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
in
various
other
sections
of
the
code.
now
the
respondents'
argument
in
this
case...
and
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
themselves
do
not
approach
this
question
the
same
way.
they
want
the
same
result
but
they
cannot
agree,
apparently,
on
the
reasoning.
while
the
united
states
urges
that
section
506(d)
is
to
be
limited
to
a
disallowance
situation,
the
respondents
in
this
case
try
to
reach
the
result
that
they
want
by
contending
that
the
section
506(d)
does
not
apply
to
abandoned
property.
now
the
difficulty,
of
course,
in
this
case
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
valuation,
the
property
was
not
abandoned.
it
was
only
after
the
valuation
that
the
secured
creditors,
and
they
were
the
ones
that
requested
the
abandonment,
requested
the
abandonment
and
the
trustee
abandoned
the
property.
so
it
was
only
after
the
valuation
that
this
occurred.
what
the
respondents
suggest
is
that
the
code
provision
should
be
read
to
suggest
that
property
that
is
abandoned
or
will
be
abandoned
or
might
be
abandoned
somehow
should
not
be
covered
by
section
506(d).
the
problem
with
this
interpretation
is
that
they
admit
that
section
506(a)
must
apply
to
abandoned
property.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that
because
section
506(a),
by
their
own
admission,
is
a
critical
predicate
to
the
redemption
provision
of
section
722
of
the
code.
so
if
section
506(a)
applies
to
abandoned
property,
as
it
must,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
506(d)
does
not
apply.
and
the
only
argument
that
the
respondents
make
for
this
limitation
is
that
there
is
a
phrase
in
506(a),
property
in
which
the
estate
has
an
interest.
they
want
to
take
that
phrase
from
506(a),
read
it
into
506(d),
and
then
say
it
has
a
different
meaning
in
506(d),
that
it
doesn't
include
abandoned
properties.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
said
that.
i
do
not
understand
the
respondents
to
contend
that
and
for
the
reason
that
i
suggested,
it
just
can't
be
true
that
506(a)
plays
an
important
role
in
lien
bifurcation
with
respect
to
abandoned
property.
and
i
think
that
the
parties
admit
that
you
have
to
do
that
in
order
for
section
722,
the
personal
property
redemption
section,
to
work
at
all.
now
there's
various
reliance
by
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
on
the
legislative
history.
they
seem
to
admit
that
our
reading
of
this
provision
is
the
simple
meaning,
by
which
i
take
it
they
mean
the
plain
and
simple
meaning.
but
they
say
that
the
legislative
history
should
cause
the
court
to
read
the
provision
differently.
and
they
urge
that
pre-code,
it
was
clear
that
the
lien
in
this
situation
was
not
avoided.
i
have
explained
why
i
believe
that's
a
misreading
of
the
pre-code
history.
it
was
unclear
what
happened
to
a
lien
in
the
circumstances
pre-code;
not
unclear
in
what
happened
in
the
long
v.
bullard
situation
where
the
creditors
stay
out
of
the
bankruptcy,
but
unclear
what
happened
to
the
lien
when
he
came
into
the
bankruptcy.
then
they
try
to
read
the
legislative
history
of
section
506(d)
separately
from
the
legislative
history
of
section
506(a),
just
again
to
separate
the
two
of
them.
but
the
legislative
history
of
section
506(a)
makes
clear
that
congress
thought
it
was
making
a
rather
significant
change
in
this
area.
and
indeed
the
legislative
history
of
506(a)
mentions
the
concern
about
what
happens
to
liens
in
this
bifurcation
situation.
so
what
we
suggest
is
that
there
is
no
clear
pre-code
practice,
point
one;
point
two,
that
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
in
its
entirety,
that
it
is
clearly
suggesting
that
there
is
a
significant
change
being
wrought
here.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
way
506(a)
and
(d)
are
designed
to
work
and
the
way
they
carry
forward
into
other
sections
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
you
see
that
the
congressional
design
in
this
provision
could
not
be
fulfilled
if
you
were
to
adopt
either
of
the
readings
of
the
respondents
or
the
united
states
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
scalia,
i
had
difficulty
in
following
the
united
states
argument
in
that
respect,
too.
i
think
the
simple
answer
is
that
506(d)
only
applies
if
it
relates
to
property.
the
debtor
doesn't,
of
course,
apply
where
it's
some
third-party
property
or
something
like
that.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
congress
had
this
phrase,
allowed
secured
claim--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
read
that
way
because
506(a)
necessarily
has
to
apply
to
abandoned
property.
there's
also
a
question
of
when
you
make
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--right,
the
property
in
this
case
is
abandoned
to
the
debtor.
it
could
be
abandoned
to
somebody
else
under
some
circumstances.
but
under
this...
in
this
case,
it
was
abandoned
to
the
debtor.
now
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
filed,
it
was
property
of
the
estate.
it
automatically
became
property
of
the
estate.
and
section
506(a)
operates
on
that.
it's
not
an
elective
provision,
as
the
respondent
suggests,
not
up
to
the
creditor
to
decide
whether
to
have
the
bifurcation
or
not.
the
code
says
you
bifurcate.
and
you
bifurcate
in
every
case.
and
it
doesn't
depend
on
whether--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
is
one
purpose.
it
is
not
the
only
purpose.
because
throughout
the
code,
the
effort
here
is
to
resolve
things,
to
deal
with
the
secured
claim...
and
this
is
true
in
the
reorganization
chapters,
as
well
as
the
liquidation
chapter...
is
to
figure
out
how
much
of
that
should
be
treated
as
a
secured
claim
and
how
much
of
it
should
be
treated
as
an
unsecured
claim.
and
the
theory
that
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
are
articulating
is
that
something
which
is
an
unsecured
claim
really
still
is
a
secured
claim...
or
maybe
it
becomes
a
secured
claim
again
when
the
bankruptcy
is
over
with.
it's
difficult,
i
think,
to
read
the
words
of
the
statute
to
achieve
that
result.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the...
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
and
the
reason
is,
it
depends
on
what
problem
we're
talking
about.
the
argument
of
the
respondents
and
the
united
states
suggests
that
under
our
interpretation
506(d)
is
designed
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
appreciated
property,
and
to
give
the
windfall
to
the
debtor.
we're
not
suggesting
that
that
was
what
led
congress
to
create
this
situation.
what
led
congress
to
create
506(d)
and
506(a)
was
the
desire
for
certainty,
the
desire
to
have
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
resolve
the
matter,
to
pay
off
the
creditor
on
his
allowed
secured
claim,
to
give
him
an
allowed
unsecured
claim
which
he
could
recover
from
the
estate,
and
to
allow
the
property
to
pass
out
of
bankruptcy
without
some
wandering
lien
covering
some
other
amount.
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
in
bankruptcy
is
to
allow
the
property
to
go
out
and
to
continue
to
be
used
for
productive
purposes.
often,
real
property...
and
in
this
case
it's
farmland...
gets
used.
congress
doesn't
want
the
property
to
sit
there.
so
what
happens
is
that
the
debtor
begins
to
plant
the
crops,
and
farm
the
property,
and
to
make
improvements
on
it.
all
of
a
sudden
the
value
is
increased.
well,
under
those
circumstances
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
give
that
excess
value
to
the
secured
creditor.
and
yet
if
you
do
give
that
excess
value
to
the
secured
creditor,
what
is
going
to
happen?
the
debtor
is
going
to
just
sit
there
and
do
nothing.
the
property
will
remain
idle.
so
it's
an
effort
to
resolve
things,
to
come
to
a
conclusion,
and
so
that
everybody
knows
where
things
stand
at
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy.
and
it's
also--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
there
are
many
ways
around
it.
of
course,
the
valuation
doesn't
have
to
be
wrong
on
the
down
side.
it
could
be
wrong
on
the
up
side
too.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
the
code
in
the
automatic
stay
provision
says
you
can
terminate
the
automatic
stay
if
the
property
doesn't
have
value
to
the
estate.
you
can
have
the
valuation.
you
can
have
the
sale
immediately.
there's
no
reason
to
have
any
period
of
time
between
those
two.
so
in
the
majority
of
cases,
you
wouldn't
have
any
excess
value
if--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--you
could
have
judicial
error.
the
creditor,
of
course,
can
appeal
the
valuation
if
he
doesn't
like
it.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
that
depends.
it
depends
on
whether
the
property
has
been
abandoned
to
the
debtor
or
whether
it
remains
as
property
of
the
estate.
if
there
is
excess
value
there,
and
the
property
has
not
been
abandoned...
in
other
words,
the
trustee
says
well,
i
think
maybe
this
property
is
worth
more
than
the
court
said
it
was
worth...
the
property
can
be
retained
by
the
trustee
on
behalf
of
the
estate
and
the
unsecured
creditors
would
get
the
additional
value.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
how
does
the
secured...
by
a
foreclosure
sale.
and
by
working--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no,
but
i
thought
the
question
was,
if
there's
a
difference
between
the
judicially
determined--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and,
justice
white,
what
i
was
suggesting
is
if
the
property
has
not
been
abandoned
at
that
point,
the
excess
goes
to
the
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it
is,
but
section
506(d)
is
dealing
with
a
general
run
of
situations.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
and
the
language
of
it
is
pretty
clear.
it's
using--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
true.
there
can
be
some
circumstances
in
which
that
will
happen.
they
are
not
going
to
be
very
frequent.
and
the
question
is,
whether
because
of
that
possibility
in
some
speculative
number
of
cases,
the
whole
statute
is
going
to
be
rewritten
so
that
it
does
not
achieve
in
other
circumstances
the
goals
for
which
congress
designed
it.
and
we
suggest
that
the
best
guide
here
to
the
result
that
congress
wanted
was
the
language
that
it
used.
it
said
the
lien
is
void
if
it
secures
a
claim
that
is
not
an
allowed
secured
claim.
that
is...
is
language
that
is
used
again
and
again
and
again
in
the
code.
and
it
has
to
have
the
meaning
that
we
attribute
to
it.
i
understand
the
respondents
to
agree
that
in
all
these
other
sections
of
the
code
it
has
the
meaning
to
which
we
attribute
to
it.
and
they're
trying
to
say
well,
when
it
gets
to
506(d),
we're
going
to
give
it
a
different
meaning
because
there's
some
policy
here
that
we
think
should
be
read
in
here
about
a
windfall...
a
policy
which
isn't
reflected
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
that
suggestion--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--the
suggestion
of
revaluation
in
the
course
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
has
been
made
by
the
respondents.
we
think
the
code
doesn't
provide
for
it.
and
the
reason
the
code
doesn't
provide
for
it
is
that
what
you
need
is
certainty,
to
be
able
to
figure
out
in
the
reorganization
chapters
what
the
plan
of
reorganization
looks
like.
and
you
need
to
know
what's
the
secured
claim
and
what's
the
unsecured
claim.
and
if
you're
going
to
keep
revaluing
it,
it
will
be
impossible
to
have
a
plan.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
liquidation
proceedings,
that
people
will
not
know
where
they
stand.
there
may
be
errors.
life
is
filled
with
errors.
but
the
question
is,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
is
should
one
rewrite
the
statute
just
because
of
a
possibility
of
a
small
number
of
errors.
and
we
suggest
that
there
isn't
any
basis
for
rewriting
the
statute...
certainly
not
on
the
face
of
the
language,
which
we
think
is
exceptionally
clear,
and
certainly
not
in
the
legislative
history,
either.
i'd
like
just
to
take
one
moment
to
address
the
suggestion
that
there
is
this
wonderful
clarity
in
the
pre-code
practice.
there
is
wonderful
clarity
in
the
pre-code
practice,
if
the
secured
creditor
sits
out
the
bankruptcy,
the
long
v.
bullard
situation.
there
is
not
clarity
if
the
secured
creditor
comes
into
bankruptcy
and
decides
to
prove
part
of
his
claim,
that
is--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no,
it
was
not.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
it...
what...
it
was
neither
one
of
those.
what
louisville
was
was
a
case
in
which,
under
the
frazier-limkey
act,
as
originally
drafted,
the
congress
wanted
to
help
farmers.
and
they
said,
okay,
if
you've
got
a
mortgage
on
your
property,
the
debtor
keeps
the
property
for
5
years,
no
foreclosure
for
5
years.
the
creditor
gets
1
percent
interest
during
that
5-year
period.
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
5-year
period,
that
the
debtor
can
redeem
the
property
by
paying
its
value.
it
is
not
talking
about
this
bifurcated
situation.
it
is
not
talking
about
what
used
to
be
section
57(h)
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act.
and
there
has
been
no
case
that
has
been
cited
to
us,
not
one
case...
much
less
a
well-settled
practice...
not
one
case
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act
in
which
in
this
bifurcated
situation
that
the
lien
was
preserved
as
to
the
unsecured
claim.
not
one
case
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
will
depend
on
state
laws.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
he
can
redeem
it,
often
after
the
foreclosure
sale
occurs,
for
the
amount
of
the
lien...
which
we
say
will
be
the
value
of
the
property.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
that's
a
problem
that
you
have
in
any
foreclosure
sale,
whether
you
have
this
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code
involved
or
not.
that
if
there's
a
foreclosure
sale,
and
the
property
sells
for
x
amount,
it
discharges
the
debt.
and
if
the
property
goes
up
in
value,
there's
a
redemption.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
white,
that
depends
on
state
law.
and
if
there's
any
anomaly--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no,
but
the
federal
statute
does
not
control
how
long
the
debtor
has
to
redeem.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
you
not
invalidating
the
state
statute.
what
you're
doing
is
you're
saying
that
bankruptcy
has
determined
the
amount
of
the
lien.
and
everybody
agrees
that
under
some
circumstances
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
of
course
it
has
an
impact
on
the
redemption
price,
in
the
sense
that
the
lien
has
been
avoided.
but
it
doesn't
tell
you
when
the
redemption
should
be
allowed,
nor
does
it
tell
you
that
there
has
to
be
a
redemption
provision.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that's
right,
but
the
state
doesn't
have
to
have
any
redemption
provision
at
all.
it
could
say,
well--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
it
would
survive,
but
the
full
amount
of
the
lien
would
be
the
lien
that
remained
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
after
this
process
of
bifurcation
to
secured
and
unsecured
claims.
and
that's
what
congress
intended
to
do.
and
it
did
it,
i
suggested
earlier,
in
order
to
allow
people
to
go
on
with
their
lives
and
improve
the
property
and
do
things
with
it
without
having
to
worry
about
the
recapture
of
that
accreted
value,
and
without
giving
the
creditor
the
power
at
the
foreclosure
sale
to
say
to
the
debtor,
i
can
bid
$150
for
this
$100
piece
of
property.
and
if
you
don't
pay
me
more
than
it's
worth,
i
will
do
that.
and
the
reason
that
power
exists
is
that
property
is
often
worth
more
to
the
debtor
than
it
is
to
a
third
party.
for
example,
in
mrs.
dewsnup's
case,
you
have
property
which
was
with...
in
her
family
for
generations.
there's
sentimental
attachment.
it's
being
used.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
then
it
certainly
does
not--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
correct.
