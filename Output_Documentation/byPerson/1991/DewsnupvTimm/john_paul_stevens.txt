justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
to
be
sure
i
follow
the
argument.
you
say
it
just
applies
to
disallowed
claim.
but
it
doesn't,
doesn't
say
it's
void
to
the
extent
that
it
secures
something
that
is
not
an
allowed
secured
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it,
in
this
case,
the
amount
over
the
value
of
the
property...
that
is
not
an
allowed
secured
claim,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
an
unsecured
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
ask
another
question,
because
i'm
a
little
dense
on
this.
supposing
the
property
is
abandoned,
and
it's...
you've
got
a
value
on
it.
and
then
it's
sold
for
$5,000
more
than
the
valuation.
you
are
saying
that
the
lienholder
is
entitled
to
that
$5,000...
assuming
he
has
a
general
unsecured
claim
for
more
than
$5,000
at
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
but
we'd
assume
that
that
wouldn't
happen,
that
there's
enough
in
the
general...
isn't
that
then
saying
that
the
lien
continues
to
secure
the
unsecured
portion
of
the
total
claim?
because
you
are
saying
the
lienholder
has
priority
as
to
the
excess
realized
in
the
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
that
case,
would
a
valuation...
as
i
read
the
statute,
i
thought
the
valuation
generally
would
take
place
at
the
time
of
any
proposed
distribution.
and
if
there
were
an
offer
for
more
outstanding,
i
would
suppose
that
the
court
would
value
the
property
at
the
market
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
pre-code
practice
before
you
get
into
that?
was
it
perfectly
clear
before
the
code
that
an
undersecured
creditor
would
be
treated
as
an
unsecured
creditor
for
the
part
of
the
excess...
the
amount
of
the
security
was
less
than
the
amount
of
the
total
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
he...
is
one...
was
one
of
his
options
was
to
have
the
land
protect
his
secured
position
to
the
value
of
the
property,
and
be
an
unsecured
creditor
for
the
balance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
what
you've
read...
what
you've
read
i
don't
think
addresses
the
precise
question
i
asked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
could
ask
you
just
one
question?
in
(d),
could
you
read
the
phrase,
not
an
allowed
secured
claim,
to
mean
disallowed?
to
the
extent
that
a
lien
secures
a
claim
against
the
debtor
that
is
a
disallowed
secured
claim...
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
but
may
i
just
interrupt,
because
i'm
trying
to
think
through
justice
scalia's
problem,
too.
if
it
applies
only
to
property
of
the
debtor,
could
it
not
equally
be
read
to
apply
only
to
property
of
the
bankrupt
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that.
because
if
it's
abandoned,
presumably
at
the
time
of
the
abandonment
the
valuation
is
made.
and
i
take
it...
i
see
what
you're
saying.
it
continues
to
apply.
then
it
becomes
debtor's
property,
but
not
part
of
the
estate
property.
that's
what
you're
saying,
if
it
had
an
abandonment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
protect
the
creditor's
interest
to
the
extent
it's
unsecured,
isn't
that
right?
the
basic
purpose
of
(a)
is
to
be
sure
that
the
creditor
is
not
limited
to
his
asset
when
he,
in
fact,
has
a
larger
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
right,
though,
that
the
problem
only
arises
if
the
valuation
is
not
made
at
the
time
of
the
disposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
not
if
the
statute
is
read
literally.
because
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
lien
would
be
void.
exactly.
and
i
suppose
it
could
no
longer
control
the
redemption
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
the
price
it
will...
the
price
he
has
to
pay
if
he
does
redeem...
state
law
says
you
can
only
redeem
if
you
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
indebtedness
or
the
full
amount
of
the
original
lien.
and
if
the
lien
is
void
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
it
seems
to
me
you're
invalidating
that
state
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
saying
that
federal
law
would
not
have
any
impact
on
the
redemption
price
that
a
state
could
require
on
those
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
when,
but
what
must
be
paid
at
the
time
of
redemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
it
does
have
one
that
says
you've
got
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
lien,
would
that
state
requirement
survive
under
your
theory,
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
i
suppose
also
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
valuation
is
to
prevent
the
creditor
from
buying
into
the
property
at
an
unreasonably
low
figure,
and
therefore
retaining
an
unreasonably
large
unsecured
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
this
case,
of
course--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
one
of
the
purposes
i
would
think
of
this
provision.
