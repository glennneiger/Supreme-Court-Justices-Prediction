justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
coming
to
us
from
the
tenth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
a
chapter
7
debtor,
filed
an
adversary
proceeding
asserting
the
right
to
strip
down,
as
they
called,
the
respondent's
lien
on
a
certain
land
to
the
judicially
determined
value
of
the
collateral.
the
bankruptcy
court
entered
a
judgment
of
dismissal
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
is
not
a
case
that
lends
itself
to
announcement
from
the
bench
and
suffices
to
say
that
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
too
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
joins.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
