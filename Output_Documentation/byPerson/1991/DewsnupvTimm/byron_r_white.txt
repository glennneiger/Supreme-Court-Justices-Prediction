justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
dyk,
does
the
secured
creditor
still
have
the
option
of
staying
under
the
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
doesn't
have
a
choice.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
506(a)
didn't
apply
to
abandoned
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
united
states'
position,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
other
position,
what
does
506(d)
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
3
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
the
secured
creditor
comes
in
and
bifurcates
the
claim.
part
of
it's
secured
and
part
of
it's
unsecured.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
does
(d)
to...
(d)
do
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
claim
is
that
the...
the
claim...
the
claim
has
not
been
fully
allowed
as
a
secured
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
(d)
has
no
application
whatsoever,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
same
argument
made
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it...
was
it
brief...
the
same
arguments
made
down
in
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
not
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
had
a...
you
don't
defend
the
notion
that
the
case
can
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
estate
has
an
interest
in
the
property,
in
abandoned
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
want
to...
you
want
to
affirm
on
another
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
under
the...
under
the
old
code,
the
1930...
under
the
chandler
act,
that
your
client
would
have
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
disagrees
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
there
is
money
to
be
distributed
to
general
creditors,
and
he
comes
in,
and
he
wants
to
share
in
it...
and
yet
he
also
wants
to...
to
have...
he
wants
his
lien
to
survive.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
he
gets
his
share
of
whatever
is
distributed
to
general
creditors,
to
the
extent
he's
got
an
unsecured
claim,
he
gets
to
share
in
the
distribution.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
he
also
has
his
lien.
and
if
the
property
is
really
worth
more
than
they
thought
it
was,
he
gets
more
than
other
creditors,
but
of
course
he's
got
a
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
were
you
reading
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
go
back
over
that
last
point
for
just
a
minute.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
doesn't,
and
the
sale
is
held
very
quickly,
but
nevertheless
for
some
reason
or
another
it
sells
for
more
than
the
valuation.
who
gets
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
the
secured
creditor
get
his
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
that
foreclosure
sale
happens,
it
certainly
isn't
part
of
the
estate
anymore.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
foreclosure
sale
the
property
sells
for
more
than
it
was
valued
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dyk,
suppose
that
when
the
property's
valued
there's
an
immediate
sale,
and
the
property
sells
for
exactly
the
amount
of
the
valuation.
does
the...
will
the
debtor
have
a
right
to
redemption
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
let's
assume
he
does
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
this
will
be
true
even
if...
even
if
at
the
end
of
the
redemption
time,
which
may
be
2
years,
6
months...
suppose
the
property
then
is
suddenly
worth
twice
what
it
sold
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
secured
creditor
buys
it
for
the
amount
of
the
valuation.
and
he
just
owns
the
property,
and
it's
suddenly
worth
more,
twice
more
than
it
was,
than
what
it
sold
for,
what
he
paid
for
it.
can
the
debtor
redeem
by
just
paying
