mr.
taranto--
--i'm
sorry,
can
i--
--go
ahead.
do
you
read,
in
section
722,
the
same
phrase...
you
read
it
differently
in
722
than
you
read
it...
than
you
read
it
in
506(d).
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
--had
you
finished
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
go
back
to
the
other
hypothetical
you
were
just
saying...
why
should
it...
why
does
it
have
to
be
that
if
the
property
is
not
abandoned
by
the
estate,
and
then
it
sells
for
more
than
it
was
originally
valued,
why
does
it
have
to
be
that
that
excess
would
go
to
the
unsecured
creditors?
why
could
you
simply
not
recalculate
under
(a)
what
the
amount
of
the
secured
claim
is?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
quite
wrong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
it
should
go
to
the
unsecured
creditors,
rather
than
to
the
secured
creditor.
