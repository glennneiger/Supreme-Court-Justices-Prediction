justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
us,
mr.
dyk,
how
does
the
valuation
work?
is
the
valuation,
i
take
it,
at
the
time
of
filing?
and
what
happens
if
the
value
increases?
is
there
a
hearing
on
valuation?
can
you
just
tell
me
how
that
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
if
the
value
has
gone
up
after
the
time
of
filing,
then
the
trustee
wouldn't
abandon
it
and
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
always
true,
i
take
it,
in
the
relations
between
the
debtor
and
the
lienholder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
that's
what
the
lienholder
bargained
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
true
under
the
attorney
general's
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
that's
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
in
agreement
with
his
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
plausible
hypothetical
that
a
creditor
who
is
a
lienholder
would
receive
some
distribution
as
a...
from
the
general
estate
to
the
extent
that
his
claim
is
undersecured,
and
that
that
would
happen
before
there
is
a
sale
on
the
property
and
a
foreclosure
of
the
lien?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
within
that
3
percent,
is
that
a
plausible
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
would
happen
then?
he
receives
$10,000
as
a...
from
the
general
estate,
and
he
has
$100,000
left
yet
to
be
paid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this...
then
this
is
still,
though,
the
same
as
justice
stevens'
question,
to
the
extent
that
the
amount
of
the
foreclosure
brings
in
more
than
the
valuation
of
the
property,
he
still
takes
that
as
a
secured
creditor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
to
the
extent
that
he
is
still
undersecured,
if
the
property
does
bring
in
more
than
anticipated,
he
still
picks
up
the
balance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
that
case,
there
is
a
windfall,
in
some
sense,
in
that
he's
received
pro
rata
too
much
from
the
unsecured
portion
of
the
estate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
whole
case
is
about
property
that
has
been
abandoned,
isn't
it?
or
am
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
put,
that
was
put
to
you
by
justice
white,
if
the
property's
been
abandoned,
then
the
debtor
is
the
one
that
keeps
the
excess.
