mr.
richard
g.
taranto
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
everyone
agrees
that
506(d)
reduces
a
lien
to
the
extent
that
the
underlying
claim
has
been
disallowed
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
our
position
is
that
that
is
all
506(d)
does.
petitioner
says
that
the
provision
also
serves
a
second,
completely
different
function;
to
deprive
secured
creditors
with
wholly
valid,
still
unpaid
claims,
of
their
full
state
law
rights
in
the
property,
and
to
transfer
some
of
the
actual
value
of
the
property
to
the
debtor,
allowing
her
to
force
a
judicial
valuation
and
redeem
the
property
at
the
court-determined
price,
and
immediately
resell
it
for
a
profit,
if
the
actual
market
value
turns
out
to
be
higher.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
if
the
claim
secured
by
the
lien
has
been
partly
or
wholly
disallowed,
the
lien
is
reduced
to
reflect
the
disallowance
of
the
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
is
also
the
government's
position
that...
that's
right.
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
two
positions.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
fact
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--it
reaches
the
identical
result.
our
lead
position
in
the
brief
is
not
so
much
an
affirmative
theory
of
what
506(d)
does
apply
to,
as
it
is
a
limiting
theory
of
what
it
cannot
sensibly
apply
to.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
two
theories
amount
to
the
same
thing.
take
the
two
types
of
cases...
chapter
11
and
13
on
the
one
hand,
where
the
debtor
is
supposed
to
keep
the
property
for
future
income,
and
chapter
7
on
the
other
hand.
in
chapter
11
and
13,
the
only
property
that
will
not
be
abandoned
is
property
the
debtor
is
to
keep.
but
506(d)
is
completely
unnecessary
in
that,
in
chapter
11
and
13,
because
those
chapters
provide
their
own
lien-reducing
provisions.
and
they
do
so
by
carefully
balancing
creditor
and
debtor
rights.
the
debtor
gets
the
benefit
of
the
lien
reduction
only
by
promising
to
pay...
pay...
promising
personal
liability
in
the
future.
in
chapter
7,
if
the
property
is
secured
by
a
lien
for
more
than
the
property
is
worth,
we
entirely
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
property
will
virtually
always
be
abandoned.
the
only
exception
will
be
where
the
property
is
either
going
to
be
purchased
under
722,
the
redemption
provision,
in
which
case
lien-stripping
is
completely
unnecessary,
or
will
be
sold
as
part
of
a
larger
asset.
so
as
a
consequence,
once
one
has
taken
abandoned
property
which
plays
no
role
in
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
out
of
the
equation,
the
only
thing
left
for
506(d)
to
do
is
to
reduce
liens
on
disallowed
claims.
we
have
two
fundamental
reasons
why
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
this
second--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i
think
that
that
would--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
the
language
could
be
read
that
way,
and
would
not
dispute
the
petitioner's
reading
is
a
permissible
reading
of
that
language,
in
isolation.
i
think
that
language
could
also
be
read
to
refer
to
the
claim
that
a
secured
creditor
comes
into
court
with.
it's
a
secured
claim,
and
if
it's
allowed,
it's
an
allowed
secured
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
petitioner
herself
does
not
read
that
language
in
isolation
or
literally.
instead,
she
says
(d)
must
be
interpreted
by
virtue
of
(a).
we
think
that's
wrong,
essentially
for
three
reasons.
one,
(a)
is
not...
even
if
(a)
was
to
be
looked
to
to
interpret
(d),
the
analysis
can't
stop
there.
and
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
other
evidence
of
what
congress
intended,
in
terms
of
the
substantive
effect
of
the
statute,
disproves
that
that's
the
right
way
to
look
at
it.
second,
there's
no
particular
reason
to
think
that
(d)
must
be
construed
in
light
of
(a),
simply
because
they're
in
506.
506
deals
with
all
of
the
general
aspects
of
secured
claims.
and,
indeed,
(a)
and
(d)
deal
with
two
completely
separate
subjects...
(a)
adjusts
the
relative
payout
priorities
between
secured
creditors
and
unsecured
creditors.
debtors
have
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
bifurcation
under
(a).
(d)
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
unsecured
creditors.
(d)
speaks
only
to
the
relationship
after
bankruptcy,
given
the
property
between
the
debtor
and
the
secured
creditor.
and
there
is
also
a
practical
reason
why
the
picture
that
petitioner
relies
on
of
(d)
simply
following
(a)
can't
be
right.
her
theory
says,
(a)
and
(d)
are
really
a
two-part
process;
first
bifurcate
the
claim,
then
reduce
the
lien.
but
if
she's
right
about
what
(d)
does,
that
picture
is
simply
upside
down.
in
virtually
all
chapter
7
cases...
perhaps
as
many
as
97
percent...
there
will
be
no
bifurcation
of
claims
under
(a),
because
there
are
no
assets
to
distribute
to
unsecured
creditors.
and
so
there
is
no
reason
to
go
through
a
judicial
valuation.
yet,
in
all
those
cases
where
the
collateral
is
valued
less
than
the
lien,
the
debtor
has
an
incentive
to
come
in,
demand
a
judicial
valuation
with
all
the
litigation
that
entails,
in
the
hope
that
by
the
time
a
foreclosure
takes
place,
that
judicial
valuation
will
turn
out
to
be
wrong...
either
because
of
appreciation
of
the
property,
or
because
of
judicial
error.
and
so
her
picture
of
(d)
simply
being
the
second
part
of
a
two-part
process,
which
is,
i
think,
the
linchpin
of
her
effort
to
rely
on
506(a)
in
interpreting
(d),
is,
in
fact,
exactly
wrong,
if
(d)--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
in
the
3
percent,
there
will
either
be...
there
will
be
a
bifurcation
of
the
claim,
and
(d)
will
then
follow
(a).
it's
perfectly
clear
that
you
can
have
both
a
bifurcation
of
the
claim
and
then
move
on
to
decide
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
lien.
our
position
is
that
congress
quite
clearly
continued
the
very
clear
pre-code
rule
that
even
if
the
creditor
comes
in
and
under
(a)
or
under
the
former
bankruptcy
act,
section
57(h)
and
splits
its
claim,
the
lien
clearly
survives.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
long
against
bullard,
as
continued
in
the
1898
act
by
section
67(d),
as
explained
by
this
court
in
louisville
state...
joint
state
bank
against
radford.
it
is
simply
untrue
that
the
law
about
what
happened
to
the
in
rem
property
rights
of
a
creditor
was
unclear
in
any
of
the
circumstances
that
petitioner
has
mentioned.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
the
claim
has
been
fully
allowed,
(d)
is
simply
inapplicable.
(d)
is
not
the--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
but
it
has
been
fully
allowed
as
a
claim
under
502,
which
is
the
provision
for
the
allowance
of
claims.
if
there
is
to
be
a
distribution
to
unsecured
creditors,
then
(a)
applies
and
the
claim
is
bifurcated,
in
that
rare
3
percent
of
cases.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i'm...
that's
right.
if
the
claim
has
been
fully
allowed,
(d)
has
no
application.
and
indeed
there
is--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
and
it's
the
second
argument
we
presented
in
our
brief,
which
we
in
fact
think
is
the...
the
only
affirmative
function
served
by
506(d).
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
he's
entitled
to
that
$5,000
unless
receiving
that
$5,000
plus
the
actual
amount
distributed
on
his
unsecured
claim
would
give
him
more
than
the...
than
the
complete
debt,
unless
he's
getting
paid--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--it
does
in
one
sense.
what
we
think
the
phrase
allowed
secured
claim
means
in
(d)
is
the
claim
that
the
secured
creditor
comes
into
court
with.
after
the
creditor
comes
into
court,
if
there
is
a
bifurcation
process
under
506(a),
which
is
a
very
rare
event
under
chapter
7,
then
there...
that
single
allowed
secured
claim
gets
split
into
two
claims,
one
of
them
still
called
an
allowed
secured
claim,
the
other
an
allowed
unsecured
claim.
but
we
think
506(d)
applies
to
the
claim
as
the
creditor
comes
into
court.
the
reason,
aside
from
the
very
clear
evidence
that
congress
meant
to
preserve
pre-code
law,
which
this
court
explained
in
three
cases
last
term,
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
effect
on
the
debtor,
this...
petitioner's
view
gives
the
debtor
exactly
the
same
redemption
right
that
congress
gave
only
to
certain
debtors,
for
only
certain
property
in
722.
petitioner
doesn't
dispute...
and...
because
it
can't
be
disputed...
that
if
the
lien
is
reduced
to
the
value
of
the
property,
then
under
every
state's
law,
the
debtor
can
exercise
her
state
law
rights,
pay-off
that
amount
of
the
lien,
and
redeem
the
property.
if
506(d)
meant
that,
there
would
have
been
no
need
whatsoever,
for
722.
and
the
very
careful
limits
that
congress
placed
on
the
redemptions
that
write
in
722
would
be
simply
overridden.
722
gives
the
specific
right
the
petitioner
claims
to
buy
property
at
a
judicially
determined
value
only
to
individual
debtors,
only
for
consumer
debts,
and
only
for
a
narrow
class
of
property
used
for
personal,
household,
or
family
use.
506(d)
would
give
that
right
to
any
debtor...
corporate
or
individual,
in
any
type
of
bankruptcy
proceeding,
for
any
type
of
property,
including
commercial
farmland.
it
simply
makes
no
sense
that
congress
would
give
a
very
narrowly
limited
redemption
right
to
debtors
in
722,
only
to
have
that
completely
overridden
in
section
506(d).
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well
we're...
first
of
all,
we're
talking
only
about
the
3
percent
of
cases
out
of
half
a
million
bankruptcy
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
is
plausible.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
under
state
law,
the
amount
of
the
lien
follows
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
debt.
and
so
if
he
actually
receives
a
payment
through
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
amount
of
the
lien
will
be
reduced
accordingly.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
he
has
already
received
a
payment
through
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
before
the
foreclosure,
then
by
the
time
of
the
foreclosure,
the
lien
will
have
been
reduced
by
that
amount...
not
by
the
amount
of
the
unsecured
claim,
but
by
the
perhaps
10
percent,
5
percent
that
he
is
being
paid
on
that
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
because
he
is
still,
of
course,
owed
money,
the
collateral
has,
in
fact,
produced
money
to
repay
his
debt,
what
he
bargained
for
was
the
right
to
proceed
against
that
collateral...
and
it
seems
to
us,
simply
to
be
a
windfall
to
the
debtor
to
pay
that
money
to
the
debtor.
one
illustration
of
that
is
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
as
to
unsecured
creditors
and
unencumbered
property,
if
the
property
were
to
appreciate
during
the
proceeding,
the
debtor
is
not
given
a
preference
over
the
unsecured
creditor.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
judicial
valuation
of
that
property,
so
there's
no
opportunity
for
judicial
error.
and
as
far
as
appreciation
is
concerned,
the
proceeds
of
any
property
of
the
estate
remain
the
property
of
the
estate.
so
if
there
is
appreciation,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
unsecured
creditors
are...
receive
the
benefit
of
that,
and
the
debtor
is
not
preferred
to
them.
it
makes
no
sense
to
prefer--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
case,
in
fact,
was
not
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
submitted
on
very
short
briefs.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
most
of
the
supporting
arguments,
yes,
indeed
were.
the
theory
that
506(d)
is--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--basically,
that's
right.
we
are
not.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
in
fact,
i
think
that
that
phrase
is,
in
fact,
something
of
a
red
herring.
it
doesn't
appear
in
506(d).
petitioner
looks
to
that
phrase
because
it's
in
506(a),
and
imports
it
into
(d)
as
defining
the
scope
of
(d).
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
for
a
different
reason,
on
the
same
statutory
ground,
but
yes,
for
a
different
reason,
a
different
reading
of
the
statute
than
the
one
that
the
tenth
circuit
relied
on.
as
i
say,
i
think
that
the
affirmative
explanation
for
what
congress
actually
had
in
mind
in
506(d)
is
that
liens
are
to
be
reduced
only
if
the
underlying
claim
has
been
disallowed.
the
abandonment
idea
is,
i
think,
illustrative
of
a
fundamental
bankruptcy
policy,
that
state
law
property
rights
are
not
to
be
impaired
in
bankruptcy
unless
there's
an
affirmative
reason
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
i
don't
think
there's...
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
that
at
all.
that's
what--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
haven't,
frankly,
just
seen
any...
any
reason
to
doubt
that.
section
67(d)
of
the
1898
act
said,
valid
liens
are
valid
through
bankruptcy.
the
description
of
the
general
rule
in
the
radford
case
in
1935
was
perfectly
general,
made
no
exception
for
what,
in
fact,
would
be
the
ordinary
case,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
bifurcation
of
the
claim,
in
a
chapter
7
case.
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
creditor
is
not
going
to
simply
sit
out
of
the
proceeding.
he
will
go
in
and
prove,
and
bifurcate
his
claim.
if
the
rule
of
long
v.
bullard
and
the
radford
case,
which
the
legislative
history
explicitly
brings
forward
in
7...
1978...
was
modified
for
the
usual
case,
there's
certainly
no
indication
whatever
that
that's
so.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
there
is
some
money
that
will
be
distributed.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
for
general
creditors.
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
then
he
loses
whatever
share
of
the
general
pool
for
general
creditors--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right,
he's
bargained
for
more
than
other
creditors.
that's
why
he's
got
a
secured
interest.
and
if
i
can
make
one
additional
point
about
the
windfall
nature.
it's
not
only
the
debtor
who
gets
a
windfall.
an
outsider
who
wants
to
come
in
and
buy
the
property
also
gets
a
windfall.
an
outsider...
take
this
case,
for
example...
an
outsider
can
come
in
and
buy
this
property
for
less
than
the
market
value.
somebody
who
is
willing
to
pay
$60,000
for
this
piece
of
property,
the
market
value,
can
finance
the
debtor's
purchase
of
the
property
for
the
$39,000
assigned
by
the
court,
and
then
buy
it
from
the
debtor
for
$50,000.00.
the
debtor
comes
out
ahead.
the
outsider
comes
out
ahead.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
this
whole
dispute
arises
in
only
two
circumstances;
either
the
petitioner
is
right
that
the
value
is
of
value
as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition,
and
there's
appreciation...
which,
in
fact,
the
majority
rule
is
to
the
contrary,
or
the
judge
makes
an
error.
it
seems
to
us
in
neither
circumstance
is
there
any
bankruptcy
giving

the
value
to
repay
some
of
the
secured
creditors.

yes.

well,
because
i
think
the
purposes
are
quite
different.
722
and
a
number
of
other
places
in
the
code
use
the
phrase
allowed
secured
claim
in
the
context
of
determining
a
payout
amount,
either
in
the
722
context
by
the
debtor,
or
in
other
contexts
by
the
bankruptcy
estate,
and
where
it
is
perfectly
sensible
that
the
phrase
is
used
to
refer
back
to
the
bifurcated
claim
under
506(a).
506(d)
simply
has...
is
addressed
to
a
completely
different
subject,
and
the
term,
therefore,
bears
the
alternative
meaning
that
we
think
the
rest
of
the
code
demands.
thank
you.
