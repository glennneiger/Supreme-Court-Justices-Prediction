mr.
ronald
j.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
general
interest
of
the
united
states
in
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
is
augmented
in
this
case
because
the
united
states,
through
the
resolution
trust
corporation,
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
and
other
federal
agencies,
is
probably
the
largest
undersecured
creditor
in
the
country.
the
practical
ramifications
of
this
case
show
why
we
care.
if
petitioner
is
correct,
bankruptcy
proceedings
not
only
avoid
a
debtor's
personal
liability
on
its
debts,
but
they
also
strip
down
the
creditor's
interest
in
its
collateral
to
judicially
determined
abstract
valuation,
and
allow
the
debtor
to
retain
any
excess
sales
proceeds...
free
and
clear
not
only
of
the
lien,
but
of
the
claims
of
all
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
now,
before
i
get
started,
i'd
like
to
address
a
problem
that
justice
kennedy
spoke
about,
which
is
the
effect
of
a
distribution
on...
to
unsecured
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy.
as
mr.
taranto
suggested,
this
does
not
happen
that
often,
but
the
structure
of
the
code
does
deal
with
it,
under
our
view,
in
a
perfectly
rational
way.
when
the
money...
section
506(a)
will
divide
all
claims
that
are
allowed
into
secured
claims
and
unsecured
claims.
if
there
is
a
distribution
of
an
unsecured
claim
of...
to
general
unsecured
creditors,
the
total
amount
that
remains
owing
to
the
creditor
will
be
reduced,
dollar-for-dollar.
and
so
under
perfectly
normal
property
principles,
the
lien
also
will
be
reduced.
if
you
start
with
a
debt
of
$100,
the
bankruptcy
judge
says
the
collateral
is
worth
$60,
and
general
unsecured
creditors
get
$5,
the
lien
is
now
$95
because
that's
all
the
debt
that's
left.
if
there's
a
foreclosure
sale,
and
the
collateral
sells
for
$70,
the
secured
creditor
would
get
$70.
if
it
sells
for
$100,
the
secured
creditor
would
get
the
$95
he's
owed,
and
the
other
$5
would
go
to
the
debtor,
as
the
owner
of
the
collateral
before
the
sale.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
that's
correct.
it's
not
necessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case,
i
think,
to
decide
how
to
deal
with
that.
it's
the
united
states'
view
that
if
the
foreclosure
occurs
before
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
has
been
completed,
you
then
have
a
marketplace
determination
of
value,
and
the
creditor's
secured
claim
should
be
written
up
to
the
amount
that
occurs
at
the
foreclosure
sale...
or
at
least
there
should
be
a
hearing
to
allow
the
parties
to
talk
about
the
value,
and
introduce
that
as
evidence.
frankly,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
reverse
should
be
true:
if
the
foreclosure
sale
brings
a
lower
value,
a
lower
value
than
what
the
bankruptcy
judge
placed
on
it,
i
don't
think
that
in
all
circumstances
the
secured
claim
should
be
written
down,
because
it's
entirely
likely
that
the
secured
creditor
bought
the
asset
for
less.
but
there
should
be
a
hearing
to
determine
what
the
value
of
the...
the
value
after
the
sale,
after
it
has
been
sold.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the
statute
is
very
unclear
on
this.
and
the
lower
courts
have
not
done
well
with
this
particular
point.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
value
shall
be
determined
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
valuation,
and
of
the
proposed
disposition
or
use
of
such
property,
and
in
conjunction
with
any
hearing
on
such
disposition
or
use,
or
on
a
plan
affecting
such
creditor's
interest.
it's
clear
that
from
that,
and
from
the
legislative
history,
that
in
some
circumstances
there
should
be
multiple
valuations.
the
legislative
history
gives
a
number
of
specific
examples.
it's
not
that
clear
whether
a
foreclosure
is
one
of
those
situations.
we
think
it
makes
good
sense,
and
if
the
issue
came
to
this
court,
i
mean
that's
what
we
think
the
court
should
decide.
i'm
just
saying
that's
not
necessarily
in
this
case,
it's
an
issue
that
would
come
up
after
this
case
has
been
decided.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
think
it
generally
depends
upon
the
value
of
the
collateral,
and
the
unlikeliness
of
an
error,
and
the
amount
of
money
that's
at
stake.
in
a
large
chapter
11,
where
you're
valuing
airplanes
for
eastern
airlines,
everybody's
going
to
come
in
on
every
side
of
the
case
and
submit
as
much
expert
testimony
as
they
can
to
try
and
get
a
value.
if
it's
a
chapter
7
case,
and
it's
a
piece
of
raw
land,
it
may
be
that
the
only
valuation
is
the
debtor's
statement
as
to
what
he
thinks
it's
worth.
and
then
the
secured
creditor
will
just
argue.
i
mean
it
depends
on
how
much
the
people
want
to
spend
on
the
valuation,
like
any
other
judicial
proceeding.
you
can
spend
a
lot,
or
not
much,
and
take
the
risk.
but
i
think
that
it's
helpful
to
focus
on
what
the
purpose
of
section
506(a)
is
in
doing
the
bifurcation,
justice
kennedy.
it...
the
purpose
of
this,
as
shown
in
the
legislative
history,
is
to
facilitate
reorganization.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
on
which
petitioner
relies,
and
explains
there's
a
significant
change,
explains
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
bifurcating
the
claims
is.
and
the
purpose
of
bifurcating
the
claims
is
not
directed
at
the
wandering
liens
to
which
petitioner
refers.
if
you
look
on
the
very
page
of
the
legislative
history
to
which
petitioner
refers,
it
explains
the
purpose.
it
is
that
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
the
secured
claim
facilitates
reorganization,
by
defining
the
precise
extent
of
the
claims
against
the
debtor,
that
must
be
treated
specially
as
secured
claims.
in
a
reorganization
proceeding,
the
property
won't
be
sold.
so
you
have
to
have
a
judicial
valuation
in
order
to
determine
how
you're
going
to
protect
the
secured
creditor.
in
a
liquidation
proceeding,
the
property
will
be
sold
in
a
foreclosure
sale,
and
there'll
be
a
marketplace
determination.
so
there's
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
needed
a
judicial
valuation
in
that
context.
um,
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
few
other
brief
points.
um,
first
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
language
of
section
506(d),
and
second
i'd
like
to
speak
about
the
pre-code
practice,
for
just
a
moment.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
um,
under
pre-code
practice,
there
were
three
options
that
a
secured
creditor
had.
a
secured
creditor
could
waive...
waive
his
security,
and
attempt
to
prove
for
a
secured...
an
unsecured
claim
for
his
entire
claim.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
okay,
he
could
just
stay
out
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
not
get
anything--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--and
then
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
eventually
foreclose,
but
he
wouldn't
have
any
personal
recourse
against
the
debtor.
or
third,
he
could
attempt
to
go
into
the
bankruptcy
and
receive,
in
the
pot
with
general
unsecured
creditors,
as
it
were,
his
pro
rata
share.
but
we
think
that's
basically
the
way
that
it
works
under
the
code.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
we
think
that
that's
fairly
clear.
i
can...
i
can
read
to
you
exactly
what
this
court
said
when
it
addressed
the
point
in
radford...
which
is
the
court
generally
surveyed
bankruptcy
law
in
the
course
of
invalidating
a
federal
statute
that
would
accomplish
the
result
that
petitioner
seeks
here.
it
says,
although
each
of
our
national
bankruptcy
acts
followed
a
major,
or
minor
depression,
none
had...
prior
to
the
frazier-limkey
amendment...
sought
to
compel
the
hold-over
mortgage
to
surrender
to
the
bankrupt
either
the
possession
of
the
mortgage
property
or
the
title,
so
long
as
any
part
of
the
debt
thereby
secured,
remained
unpaid.
it
says,
but
unless
the
mortgagee
released
his
security,
in
order
to
prove
in
bankruptcy
for
the
full
amount
of
his
debt...
which
is
one
of
the
options...
a
mortgage,
even
of
exempt
property,
was
not
disturbed
by
bankruptcy
proceedings.
we
think
it's
fairly
clear
from
that,
and
from
the
other
cases,
that
nothing
was
going
to
happen
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
would
alter
the
lien.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
that's
from
louisville
joint
stock
land
bank
v.
radford,
at
pages
582
and
583.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
it
doesn't
address
that
precise
question
directly.
but
what
it
does
is
it
says
we've
looked
at
the
bankruptcy
laws,
and
they
don't
do
what
petitioner
says
they
do.
it
doesn't
address
every
possible
way
to
do
it,
but
it
says
they
don't
do
that
in
any
provision
of
those
laws,
so--
if
petitioner
is
right,
the
court
in
radford
would
have
had
to
have
made
a
mistake.
and
considering
the
weight
that
congress
placed
on
that
analysis
in
radford
in
the
legislative
history,
i
think
it
would
be
a
relatively
slender
reed
to
suggest
that
the
radford
court
made
a
mistake
and
congress
relied
on
that
mistake.
i
really
don't
think
that
you
can
have
pre-code
practice
much
clearer
than
where
the
supreme
court,
itself,
has
said
you
can't
do
what
petitioner
wants
to
do.
congress
has
cited
the
provision
in
both
of
the
reports...
the
coming
provision,
and
then
this
court
last
year
said
we
believe
that
that's
what
the
legislative
history
means.
i
just
wanted
to
talk
briefly
about
the
language.
as
we
see
it,
petitioner's
argument
hinges
on
her
assertion
that
the
reference
in
section
506(d)
to
a
claim
that
is
not
an
allowed
secured
claim
must
be
taken
to
refer
to
claims
that
are
allowed
but
not
secured.
now,
there's
three
real
problems
with
that
reading.
the
most
fundamental
problem
is
that
even
petitioner
is
not
willing
to
apply
the
provision
literally
to
all
claims
that
are
allowed
but
not
secured,
because
petitioner
acknowledges
that
it
would
be...
implicitly
in
its
brief...
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
void
the
liens
on
property
owned
by
third
parties
that
secure
claims
that
are
allowed
but
not
secured.
the
second
problem
with
this
reading,
we
think,
is
that
it
leaves
section
506(d)
in
an
odd
place
in
the
code.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
petitioner's
general
submission
is
that
the
reference
in
section
506(d)
to
a
claim
that
is
not
an
allowed,
secured
claim--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--refers
not
only
to
claims
that
are
secured
but
not
allowed...
with
which
we
agree--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--but
also
to
claims
that
are
allowed
but
not
secured.
but
petitioner
is
unwilling
to
have
the
provision
apply
to
all
claims
that
are
allowed
but
not
secured.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
if
you
read
it
that
way,
it
would
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
because
it
covers
not
only
claims
that
are
disallowed,
but
claims
covered
by
section
506(d)(2)
that
have
not
been
allowed
because
the
creditor
did
not
come
in
under
section
502.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i'm
going
to
try
and
be
as
brief
as
possible.
under
section
506(a),
if
there
is
a
secured
creditor
that
has
collateral
owned
by
the
debtor,
and
collateral
owned
by
a
third
party,
such
as
the
debtor's
brother,
or
a
guarantor,
and
the
collateral
owned
by
the
debtor
is
worth
$60,
and
the
collateral
owned
by
the
debtor's
brother
is
worth
$60,
the
debt
is
$100.
after
section
506(a)
operates,
there
will
be
an
allowed
secured
claim
for
$60,
and
an
allowed
unsecured
claim
for
$40.
pursuant
to
section
506(d),
petitioner
suggests
it
will
void
all
of
the
lien
on
the...
it
will
void
the
$40
of
the
lien
on
the
collateral
owned
by
the
debtor.
naturally,
you
would
think,
reading
the
statute
as
he
says,
is
literally,
it
would
void
the
other
lien
as
well.
and
we
obviously
think
you
should
not
do
that.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
