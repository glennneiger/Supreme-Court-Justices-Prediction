justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
leave
that,
what
does
that
mean?
what
does
that
mean?
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
overruling...
is
congress
repealing
marbury
v.
madison?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
do
they
need
this
last
sentence?
why
do
they
need
this
second
sentence
of
subpart
(a)
in
order
to
achieve
that?
i
mean,
they
say
there
shall
be
no
review
of
these
sections...
judicial
review
of
these
sections.
is
it
the
government's
position
that
that
means
judicial
review
of...
what,
the
secretary's
implementation
of
those
sections?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
starr,
the
brief
of
northwest
forest
resource
council
suggests
that
we
really
don't
have
to
get
to
this
very
difficult
question
of
6(a),
that
these
cases
are
mooted
by
(b)(3)
and
(5)
alone,
and
we
can
just
look
at
that
and
then...
it
makes
the
case
a
lot
less
interesting,
but
we're...
you
know,
it
would
help
us
to
get
rid
of
it
faster.
[laughter]
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
general
starr,
what
if
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
amend
their
complaints
to
name
a
couple
more
statutes?
does
the...
does
this
legislative
language
pick
up
after
included
statutes,
or
do
we
have
to
look
to
the
date
of
the
enactment,
or
perhaps
the
date
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
enactment--
--osha--
--to
see
what
particular
statutes
mentioned
in
the
complaints
are
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
amend
their
complaints,
any
statutory
requirement
that's
mentioned
by
these
particular
plaintiffs
in
these
particular
cases
gets
zapped
by
this
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
congress
frequently
speaks
that
way.
it
says...
instead
of
amending
the
law,
it
says
this
shall
be
deemed
to
satisfy
that
requirement,
and
it
can
do
that,
can't
it?
i
mean,
its
laws
mean
what
they
want
it
to
mean.
it
can
say,
you
know,
green
shall
be
deemed
to
yellow.
we'll
listen
to
that,
won't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
deciding
the
case.
suppose
that
there's
a
prosecution
of
a
particular
individual
under
a
federal
statute,
and
congress
sees
that
prosecution
and
says,
oh,
gee,
we
didn't
mean
the
statute
to
apply
to
something
like
that.
with
that
case
prominently
in
mind,
it
passes
a
statute
repealing
that
criminal
prohibition,
whereupon,
of
course,
the
prosecution
would
have
to
be
dismissed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
that
what
you
mean
by
deciding
a
particular
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
it
isn't
the
purpose
of
this
one
just
to
decide
this
particular
case,
either,
or
the
effect
of
it.
i
mean,
i
assume
that
if
another
suit
were
filed...
identical
to
the
suit
referred
to
in
the
legislation,
that
suit
would,
under
the
language
here,
not
be
permissible
either,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
if
you
had
another
prosecution
in
my
hypothetical
under
the
same
law
for
the
same
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
those
cases
are
being
decided
by
congress'
amending
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
true,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
6(a),
instead
of
referring
at
the
end
of
that
first
sentence
to,
is
adequate
consideration
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
statutory
requirements
that
are
the
basis
for
the
consolidated
cases
captioned,
blah,
blah,
blah...
instead
of
saying
that...
and
i
must
say,
i
don't
know
why
they
said
that...
what
if
they
had
just
copied
the
citations
of
the
statutes,
you
know,
gone
to
the
briefs
in
the
cases
and
just
copied
those
same
statutes?
would
you
be
contending
that
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
wait,
it
doesn't
have
to
say
spotted
owls.
it
says
"the
statutes".
it
says,
is
adequate
for
purposes
of
meeting
the
statutory
requirements
that
are
the
basis.
all
it
does
is
refer
to
the
statutes.
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
spotted
owls,
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
these
particular
locations.
all
it
does
is,
instead
of
incorporating
by
reference
the
statutory
requirements
that
are
included
in
the
lawsuits,
it
names
the
statutory
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
cases
may
have,
but
the
statutory
requirements
are
requirements
that
apply
to
many
other
things
besides...
besides
spotted
owls,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
let
me
put
my
question
the
way
i
want
to
put
it.
what
this
hypothetical
statute
says
is
exactly
what
this
(6)(a)
now
says,
except
at
the
very
end
there
it
cites
the
statutory
sections
that
were
at
issue
in
these
cases,
nothing
more.
it
just
cites
them,
for
purposes
of
meeting
the
following
statutory
requirements,
colon...
and
then
it
names
them.
is
there
any
doubt
whether
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
invalidated
by
the
legislative
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
invalidated
by
its
legislative
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
don't
believe
that.
suppose
i
don't
even
look
at
the
legislative
history,
and
i
think
that
if
they
named
this
statute
this
would
be
a
perfectly
valid
amendment
of
the
law,
does
it
make
any
difference
if,
instead
of
naming
the
statutes,
they
incorporate
them
by
reference?
suppose
the
statutes
were
mentioned
specifically
somewhere
else...
in
webster's
dictionary,
and
they
referred
to
the
statutes
referred
to
in
webster's
dictionary,
that
would
be
all
right,
right?
but
the
vice
here
is
that
they
referred
to
these
cases
that
mentioned
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
you
have
the
intention.
that's
what
really
does
it
for
you.
it's
that
they
intend
to
get
a
different
result
in
these
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it
acts
the
way
congress
is
supposed
to
act
by
resolution
of
both
houses
submitted
to
the
president.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
chadha
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
was
the
problem
with
chadha,
wasn't
it?
congress
was
not
acting--
justice
antonin
scalia
are
any
of
those
deeming
statutes
appropriations
measures?
that
was
part
of
the
ground
for
the
decision
below,
that
they
didn't
think
this
change
could
be
made
in
an
appropriations
measure.
the
government
has
no
problem
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
had
to
listen,
general
starr.
i'm
not
sure
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
congress
wanted
to
that
indelicate
they
couldn't
address
us
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
their
statute,
and
we
have
to
do
what
their
statutes
say,
don't
we?
