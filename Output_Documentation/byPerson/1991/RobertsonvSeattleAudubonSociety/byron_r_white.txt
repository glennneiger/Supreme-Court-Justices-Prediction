justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you...
or
i
would
say,
if
we
decide
for
you
that
probably
the
case
is
moot,
but
we
have
to
decide
for
you
before
it
becomes
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
decide
for
you,
we
have
to
say
that
this...
that
the
ordinary
law
was
changed
for
1
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
that
the...
without
passing
on
means
we're
not
passing
on
the
adequacy
of
the
administrative
review
under
existing
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under...
but
here
is...
here's
some
new
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
solicitor
general--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
statute
says
is
adequate
consideration
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
statutory
requirements
that
are
the
basis
for
these
consolidated
cases.
it
sounds
to
me
like
they
are
saying...
it
doesn't
sound
like
they're
amending
the
statute--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
for
a
year.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are
meeting
the
statutory
requirements
that
are
involved
in
the
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
else
can
you
read
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
but
adequate
consideration
under
these
statutes,
under
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
involved
in
these
lawsuits.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
odd
enough
to
be
holy
trinity,
eh?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
this
is...
we
ought
to
look
at
this
sort
of
like
a
term
of
art;
it's
so
usual.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly,
if
we
decide
for
you,
why
these
cases
are
certainly
over,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
for
a
year
they're
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
that
time,
all
the
timber...
the
timber
will
all
be
cut.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--a
lot
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
318
had
just
expressly
said,
we
hereby
are
amending
the...
and
they
list...
they
identify
the
statute,
we're
amending
them
so
that
they
will
not
be
violated
if
these...
if...
as
long
as
there's
compliance
with
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)?
what
if
they'd
just
been
expressly...
had
changed
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
you
would.
i
suppose
the
court
would
have
to...
in
your
cases
they
would
have
to
say,
well,
they've
now
amended
the
statute
and
there's
no
violation
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
got
a
rule
of
construction.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
says
if
you
live...
if
you
stay
out
of
these
areas,
then
the
area
that
should
be...
that
is
going
to
be
logged
will
not
be
subject
to
any
challenge.
isn't
that
what
that
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
was
also
the
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no...
that's
what
you
said
awhile
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
true,
i
take
it
you
would
be
arguing
the
same
if,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
if
there
was
a
specific
listing
of
the
statutes
that
were
involved
and
then
congress
said
those
statutes
are
repealed
for
a
year
in
these
areas
as
long
as
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
are
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
just
repealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
this
language
is
readable
as
indicating
clearly
that
congress
does
not
want
these
other
laws
to
be
applied
for
a
year.
they
just
don't
want
them
to
apply
for
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
else
did
it
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
they
wanted
to
change
the
results
in
these
cases,
but
they
did
it
in
a
way
that
i
would
think
they
had
the
power
to
do,
namely
they
repealed
the
laws
on
these
cases,
say
that
the
administrators
aren't
complying
with
these
statutes,
and
the
congress
says
look,
these
statutes
are
repealed
for
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
can't...
what
else
did
congress
want
to
attain
by
these
words
in
this
statute
except
to
not
have
those
statutes
apply
for
a
year,
even
if
it
meant
doing
away
with
the
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know,
i...
have
you
run
across
any
other
effort
where
a
statute
is
repealed
just
in
a
certain
area
for
a
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
vested
rights
not
to
log.
justice
byron
r.
white
--under
your
theory?
