justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioners
managed
certain
federally
owned
forests
known
to
contain
the
northern
spotted
owl.
respondents
filed
two
separate
lawsuits
against
petitioners
alleging
that
the
proposed
harvesting
sale
of
timber
from
these
forests
would
kill
the
owls
in
violation
of
five
different
federal
statutes.
the
courts
below
preliminary
enjoined
some
of
the
challenge
of
harvesting.
in
response
to
the
ongoing
litigation,
congress
enacted
the
northwest
timber
compromise
subsections
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
of
which
prohibited
harvesting
all
together
from
various
designated
areas
within
the
affected
forests.
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
stated
that
management
of
the
forest
according
to
these
two
provisions
was
adequate
consideration
to
meet
the
statutory
requirements
underlying
the
two
pending
cases.
the
two
district
courts
considering
these
cases
held
that
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
had
effectively
modified
the
original
statutory
provisions,
and
that
the
subsections
so
construed
was
constitutional.
in
a
consolidated
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
held
that
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
did
not
amend
any
law
but
directed
the
courts
to
reach
a
particular
result
in
pending
cases
under
previously
existing
law.
under
that
interpretation,
the
court
held
that
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
was
unconstitutional
under
our
decision
in
united
states
versus
klein.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
did
modify
previously
existing
law.
before
the
subsection
was
enacted,
respondent's
claims
would
fail
only
if
the
challenged
harvesting
satisfied
each
of
five
old
provisions.
under
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
however,
these
same
claims
would
fail
if
the
harvesting
satisfied
subsections
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
to
new
and
different
provisions.
moreover,
we
find
nothing
in
subsection
(b)(6)(a)
that
purported
to
direct
any
particular
finding
of
fact
or
application
of
law
to
fact.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
