mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
a
decision
by
the
spotted
owl
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
declaring
unconstitutional
a
statute
passed
by
congress.
that
act
embodied
what
is
known
popularly
as
the
northwest
timber
compromise.
that
compromise
was
designed
to
resolve
ongoing
controversy
over
logging
activities
in
various
areas
that
serve
as
a
habitat
for
the
northern
spotted
owl.
specifically,
section
318
of
the
department
of
interior
appropriations
act
set
forth
in
quite
elaborate
detail
the
terms
of
a
compromise
that
was
hard-fought
over
logging
activity
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
had
divided
not
only
industry
and
industrial
groups;
it
had
divided
communities.
there
was
a
great
sense
of
distress
and
a
sense
of
urgency.
congress'
response
was
section
318.
in
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
however,
one
critical
part
of
that
compromise...
subsection
(b)(6)(a)...
was
unconstitutional.
in
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
that
subsection
stepped
across
the
permissible
constitutional
line
between
the
congress
repealing
or
amending
a
statute
and
going
beyond
and
into
the
province
of
article
iii
by
directing
the
federal
courts
how
to
decide,
in
this
instance,
two
pending
cases.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
erred,
and
in
so
doing
violated
one
of
the
cardinal
principles
of
constitutional
adjudication
by
interpreting
a
statute
needlessly
so
as
to
raise
article
iii
questions
when
there
is
an
entirely
plausible
reading
of
the
statute
that
avoids
the
article
iii
controversy
entirely.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it's
somewhere
in
between.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
do
think
there
is...
there's
not
a
lot
of
language
here
that's
plain,
and
there
certainly
is
a
spirit
to
the
compromise,
but
my
argument
is
going
to
be
grounded
on
the
structure
of
this
statute
and
putting
(b)(6)(a)
into
context,
not
some
broad,
vague,
spiritual
context,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
at
least
not
limited
only
to
the
terms
"determines"
and
"directs".
now,
justice
stevens'
question
brings
me
to
the
statute
itself.
it
took
us
13
pages
to
set
this
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
12-1/2,
to
be
precise.
it
is
complicated,
but
there
are
three
basic
aspects
to
this
statute.
first,
it
directs
the
forest
service
and
the
blm
to
offer
timber
sales
at
specified
levels
at...
during
fiscal
year
1990,
and
it
says
this
shall
be
done.
it's
quite
clear.
second,
the
statute
sets
forth
a
standard
that
is
to
guide
the
federal
agencies
in
the
timber
sales
process.
it
does
something
quite
important
from
the
environmentalists'
standpoint.
it
expands
significantly
the
protected
areas
of
habitat
for
the
spotted
owls.
it
establishes
a
streamlined
administrative
process
and
provides,
as
the
original
version
on
which
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
seek
to
use,
something
that
the
earlier
version
did
not.
it
provides
for
judicial
review
of
specific
sales.
third,
and
then
critically
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
come
to
(b)(6)(a).
that
does
two
things.
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
first,
lest
i
overlook
it,
to
the
second
sentence.
i
think
that's
critical.
the
congress
says
in
the
second
sentence
of
(b)(6)(a)
that
the
standards
that
the
guidelines
adopted
by
law,
by
subsections
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5),
shall
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
first
sentence...
and
of
course,
it
was
the
first
sentence
that
was
held
unconstitutional,
and
it
says,
in
short,
without--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
it's
strange--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
not
at
all.
that
they
are
clearly
not
doing.
what
they
are
saying
is
that
in
this
compromise
which
embodies
a
comprehensive
solution
for
a
single
fiscal
year
on
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states,
we,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
exercising
our
plenary
power,
do
ordain
and
enact
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
as
the
substantive
law
to
govern.
now,
what
does
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
do?
primarily,
what
those
two
subsections
do,
which
are
insulated
from
judicial
review,
is
to
expand
the
areas
of
protected
habit,
the
so-called
soha's.
that's
what
this
fight
is
all
about.
are
we
going
to
protect
trees
and
timber
areas,
or
are
we
not?
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
believe
we
should
have
none
of
this
activity.
congress
is
saying,
it
is
our
business
to
step
in
and
to
resolve
divisive
controversies
that
raise
important
questions
of
public
policy,
and
those
questions
were
very
emphatically
discussed
and
debated
on
the
floor.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
we
set
forth
the
quotation
that
we
also
allude
to
in
our
opening
brief
by
senator
adams
of
washington,
who
said,
we
no
longer
have
time
to
work
this
out
at
a
leisurely
pace.
the
litigation
has
been
enormously
divisive
and
disruptive.
we
need
a
solution,
and
here
is
our
comprehensive
solution
for
1
year
and
1
year
alone.
after
1990,
after
fiscal
year
1990,
there
will
be
no
impediment
to
the
continuation
of
this
litigation,
but
more
than
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
i
think
fairly
read,
given
congress'
intent,
it
means
blm's
and
the
forest
service's
administration
and
management
of
these
lands
consistent
with
these
guidelines.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
is
a
possible
reading.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
have
to
concede
that
it
is
a
plausible
reading,
justice
o'connor.
what
we
think,
however,
is
critical
for
purposes
of
getting
at
congress'
intent
is
that
congress
wanted
to
permit
only
specific
challenges,
and
there
have
been
those,
to
specific
sales,
but
it
wanted
to
put
an
end
to
the
overall
controversy
as
to
whether
the
forest
service
and
the
blm
had
faithfully
and
adequately
taken
environmental
and
specifically
spotted
owl
considerations
into
account,
and
it
answered
that.
it
does
what
congress
seeks
to
do.
it
laid
down
a
line.
it
laid
down
a
legislative
action,
and
that
seems
to
us
quite
far
removed
from
what
has
vexed
this
court
in
united
states
v.
klein
and
its
more
recent
progeny,
including
justice
blackmun's
decision
for
this
court
in
sioux
nation.
here,
what
is
congress
doing?
congress
is
saying,
here
is
the
way
we
want
the
public
lands
to
be
administered
during
this
particular
year.
because
this
has
been
so
remarkably
divisive,
we
do
not
want
to
intrude
into
the
arena
of
the
courts.
the
opening
words...
and
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
don't
have
a
very
good
response
to
the
opening
words
of
(b)(6)(a).
what
congress
seems
to
be
saying
is,
we're
not
in
the
business
of
deciding
issues
of
law.
it
uses
the
terms...
and
this,
justice
stevens,
is
the
plain
language...
without
passing
on
the
legal
and
factual
adequacy
of
what?
the
two
critical
administrative
documents
that
are
under
challenge
in
the
litigation
in
oregon
and
washington.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
it
does,
and
congress,
curiously
enough,
does
that
a
lot.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
shall
be
deemed
adequate.
as
we
set
forth
in
footnotes
18
and
19
of
our
brief,
congress
when
it's
exercising
its
plenary
powers
with
respect
to
the
public
lands
does
that
all
the
time.
we
have
identified
in
footnote
18
of
our
brief
in
the
second
paragraph
29
instances
where
congress
has
done
precisely
that,
justice
stevens.
indeed,
it
does
it
every
time
it
does
that
which
ultimately
the
respondents
here
are
seeking
to
achieve.
what
they
want,
in
effect,
is
for
these
public
lands
in
oregon
and
the
national
forests
in
washington
to
be
declared
wilderness
areas,
untouchable
by
the
human
hand.
and
congress
does
that.
it
does
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
says,
this
area
is
now
wilderness;
we
will
have
no
commercial
economic
activity.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
has...
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
i
do
agree,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
a
distinction.
i
think
if
congress
had
been
trying
to
direct
the
courts
to
enter
a
judgment,
and
they
didn't.
and
now--
go
back
and
look
at
klein.
that's
a
two-paragraph
statute
in
klein
that
this
court
struck
down
as
unconstitutional.
there's
all
sorts
of
language
in
that
statute
saying,
and
the
court
shall
do
this,
and
the
court
shall
do
that,
and
it
shall
dismiss,
and
the
like.
it
is
chock-full
of
directions
to
a
court
on
what
to
do
with
a
particular
case.
but
what
congress
can
do...
and
that's
what
it
has
done
here.
it
does
it
all
the
time.
it's
the
nature
of
legislation...
is
to
lay
down
a
rule
of
decision,
and
justice...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
as
an
irreducible
minimum,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
congress
cannot
act
in
a
way
that
clearly
invades
a
textually
committed
constitutional
power,
namely
that
of
the
pardon
power
of
the
president,
and
direct
the
courts
to
become
parties
and
privy
to
that
invasion,
and
that's
precisely
what
was
at
work
in
klein.
lincoln's
proclamation
in
1863
had
said
once
you
come
forward
and
you
renounce
your
prior
fealty
to
the
confederacy,
you
will
in
fact
be
forgiven,
and
your
property
rights
will
be
restored.
that
was
a
part
of
the
pardon
which,
before
his
death,
wilson
accepted,
and
in
kline
his
administrator
said
to
this
court,
look
at
what
the
reconstruction
congress
is
seeking
to
do.
it
is
trying
to
tear
asunder
lincoln's
exercise
of
his
presidential
power.
now,
what
this
court
also
said
in
justice
blackmun's
opinion
for
this
court
in
sioux
nation
is
that
what
kline
was
getting
at
was
directing
the
entry
of
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
government,
and
that's,
again,
not...
that
more
modern
reading
of
kline
is
not
at
issue
here,
i
don't
think
fairly
read.
again,
i
think
the
court
has
a
choice.
it
can
give
this
statute
an
immensely
hard
reading,
which
is
what
the
spotted
owl
panel
chose
to
do...
aha,
we're
being
directed,
congress
is
directing
us.
and
yet
congress
said,
we're
not
passing
on
the
factual
and
legal
adequacy
of
the
two
administrative
documents
that
are
under
challenge
in
the
litigation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is,
i
think
from
their
standpoints...
i'm
going
to
now
give
you
what
i
think
would
be
the
least
favorable
answer
to
me,
and
that
is
in
(f),
all
of
(b)(3)(f).
what
congress
says,
all
other
standards
and
guidelines
contained
in
the
chief's
record
of
decision
are
adopted.
i
think
what
they
will
say,
justice
o'connor,
is
that's
bad.
they
can't
be
doing
that.
they
can't
ordain
and
say
we
like
that
agency
decision.
we
believe
they
can,
that
congress
can
in
fact
say,
here's
the
way
the
public
lands
are
going
to
be
administered
because...
and
here's
the
point,
justice
o'connor.
remember
what
had
happened.
we've
had
years
of
litigation
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
has
been
one
of
the
most
divisive
controversies
in
that
part
of
the
country,
and
congress
is
saying...
and
if
i
may
again
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
by
senator
adams,
the
severity
of
the
crisis...
severity
of
the
crisis
this
year
did
not
give
us
the
luxury
of
time
to
slowly
mull
over
this
issue.
mills
were
shutting
down,
jobs
were
threatened
and
gone,
our
state
was
being
torn
apart,
and
tensions
were
rising
with
a
real
potential
of
violence.
congress
said,
we
don't
want
to
get
into
the
adjudication
business,
but
we
do
want
to
get
into
the
policy-making
business,
and
here
is
the
policy
for
fiscal
year
1990.
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
what
we
are
most
anxious
for--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
this
issue
is,
in
fact,
not
moot.
there
are
16
sales
that
have
been
affected
pursuant
to
applicability
of
this
statute,
and
i
don't
think
the
other
side
is
in
disagreement
that
this
case
lives
on.
it
in
fact...
there
is,
in
effect,
as
we
look
at
the
statute
again...
returning
to
the
structure...
looking
at
(g),
(g)
provides
for
a
challenge
to
specific
sales,
specific
timber
sales,
and
that
has
been
going
on
and
in
fact
16,
as
i
say,
sales
have
been
enjoined.
and
more
than
that,
in
light
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
there
is
ongoing
litigation
with
respect
to
the
correctness
of
the
decisions
of
the
administrative
agencies
under
the
law,
because...
let's
step
back.
what
is
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision?
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
the
respondents
get
the
benefit
of
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
and
the
litigation
goes
on
with
respect
to
whether
this
activity
complies
with
the
other
statutes,
the
five
statutes
that
were
invoked
in
the
original
litigation.
this
is
very
much
alive.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
exactly.
if
we
win,
then
yes,
those
timber
sales
should
in
fact
go
forward
and
completed
and
bring
to
a
conclusion
that
which
was
contemplated
by
congress
in
the
opening
subsection
of
318(a).
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct,
that
congress
was,
justice
white,
saying
we
understand
there
are
a
lot
of
issues.
there
are
about
32
statutes...
i've
counted
them...
31
statutes
that
are
potentially
applicable
to
the
administration
of
the
public
lands
and
the
forest
service
as
to
environmental
consideration.
that
is
a
vast
panoply
of
statutes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
exactly
our
case,
justice
white.
here
is
the
new
law,
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5).
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly,
for
a
specific
territory,
and
justice
scalia
raised
amicus
submissions.
there's
been
an
amicus
submission
that
sets
forth
a
quite
dangerous
proposition
that
congress
must
always
legislate
with
respect
to
rules
of
general
applicability.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
said
that
is
simply
not
the
way
congress
has
done
business,
but
more
than
that,
at
the
theoretical
level,
it's
not
the
constitutionally
mandated
way.
congress
is
ultimately
in
charge.
we,
the
people
on
these
lands,
and
congress
has
the
power
to
administer
these
lands
and
to
delegate
that
power
to
agencies
of
the
united
states
to
assist
it,
pursuant
to
standards
that
it
lays
down.
it
not
infrequently,
not
surprisingly,
will
legislate
one
rule
that
will
be
applicable
in
the
state
of
arizona
or
new
hampshire
and
another
for
illinois.
by
the
very
nature
of
it,
different
kinds
of
lands
are
going
to
raise
different
kinds
of
questions
and
the
like.
but
yes,
justice
stevens,
the
point
is
very
well
taken.
congress
is
rifle-shotting
in
on
these
specific
lands,
which
it
has
not
designated
as
wilderness
acts.
it
has
said,
we're
sorry,
respondents,
we
have
heard
you,
but
there
is
going
to
be
timbering
here.
it's
very
important
that
there
be
timbering
here,
because
people's
jobs
are
at
stake.
looking
ever
so
briefly
at
the
legislative
history,
one
gets
a
flavor
of
what
it
is
congress
was
concerned
about
and
what
senator
adams
was
speaking
so
forcefully
about
on
the
floor.
schoolchildren
were
seeing
schools
closed.
there
are
counties
in
oregon
that
depend
upon
these
funds
that
are
derived
from
timber
sales
to
keep
their
communities
going.
this
has
been
a
source
of
profound
economic
distress,
and
so
congress
was
not
seeking,
as
was
the
reconstruction
congress
to
order--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is
certainly
appropriate,
as
this
court
has
held
time
and
again
to
repair
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
position.
that
is
the
law
of
this
court,
and
i
do
not
quarrel
with
it,
that
we
can
repair
to
those
materials
and
to
see
what
it
was
that
was
animating
congress.
and
what
so
clearly
was
of
concern
to
congress
was
this--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you
can
read
it--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--you
can
read
it
that
way,
as--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
read
it
this
way.
i
think,
frankly,
the
more
natural
reading
in
light
of
the
"without
passing"--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--language
on
the
legal
and
factual
adequacy,
it
is
saying
to
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
the
forest
service,
stop
all
of
the
pussy-footing
around
and
get
with
the
program.
it
is
time
to
sell
this.
it
is
no
longer
time
to
bring
the
biologists
out
and
the
forest
rangers
to
put
on
their
hats
and
to
say,
here's
what
we
think
should
be
done
for
purposes
of
flpma
and
mbta
and
these
whole
panoply
of
statutes.
congress
is
saying,
enough.
here
is
what
we
want
you
to
do.
and
so
adequate
consideration,
justice
white,
yes,
it
can
lend
itself
to
more
than
one
meaning.
i
think
that
a
natural
meaning--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
odd,
but
it
is
not...
justice
white,
it
is
not
unique.
i
refer
you
again
to
the
wilderness
act
experience--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
i'm
not
reduced
to
arguing
holy
trinity.
my
argument
is
textual
and
structural
and
getting
at
congress'
intent.
i
think
we
know,
when
we
look
at
all
these
materials,
what
congress'
intent
was.
but
the
purpose
of
my
point
was
this:
when
we
look,
for
example,
at
the
colorado
wilderness
release
act,
justice
white,
94
statutes,
3270...
this
is
all
part
of
the
materials...
it
provides
that
with
respect
to
public
lands
in
colorado
that
are
being
designated
as
a
wilderness
act,
a
particular
review
shall
be
deemed
for
the
purposes
of
national
forest
management
act
planning,
quote,
"to
be
adequate
consideration
of
the
suitability
of
such
lands
for
other
purposes.
"
congress
has
gotten
into
the
habit
of
doing
this,
and
i
don't
think
it
means
offense
to
the
courts
in
doing
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
not
so
usual,
but
it
is
in
fact
a
term
of
art.
i
don't
want
to
overargue
my
point.
my
point
is
the
limited
one,
justice
white,
that
this
is
not
unprecedented.
in
fact,
congress
is
accustomed
to
doing
it.
but
i'm
not
just
relying
on
bad
habits.
what
i'm
saying
is,
those
habits
are
in
fact
rooted
in
its
powers
under
the
constitution.
what
is
it
that
we're
worried
about
in
article
iii
versus
article
i?
we're
worried
about
whether
congress
is
trenching
on
the
adjudicatory
function,
and
congress
really
didn't
think
it
was
doing
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
the
cases...
no,
justice
white,
to
the
contrary.
the
cases
go
on
with
respect
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--any
post-1990
sales
activity.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
for
a
year,
for
all
practical
purposes,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
all
the
timber.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
at
least,
i'm
not
aware
that
all
the
timber--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
that
i
concede,
because
congress
wanted,
justice
white,
a
lot
of
timber
to
be
cut.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
have
to
concede
that,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
they
are
out
of
time
by
virtue...
not
so
much
out
of
time
in
a
temporal
sense,
but
that
congress
has
stepped
in
and
has
insulated
the
rule
of
law
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
from
judicial
review,
so
i
think
that
congress
has
said
we
do
not
want
to
hear
whether
the
endangered
species
act
applies
to
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5),
although
you
will
see
they
do
have
a
provision
with
respect
to
the
endangered
species
act.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
as
long
as
they
are
challenging
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)
administration
of
the
public
lands.
i
thank
the
court
and
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
first
point
is,
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
12
we
enumerate
a
number
of
statutes
passed
by
congress
that
specifically
refer
to
pending
litigation
and
deems
the
settlement
that
is
approved
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
have
been
made
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
and
all
laws.
secondly--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--these
are
claims
against
the
united
states
as
well
as
against
states.
but
the
answer
is,
with
respect
to
appropriations
act,
i
think
the
law
is
clear
that
congress
is
at
liberty
to
lay
down
a
substantive
rule
of
law
in
an
appropriations
act.
we
may
not
admire
that
as
an
orderly
way
of
proceeding
legislatively,
but
there's
nothing
that
requires,
in
the
constitution
at
least,
for
congress
to
be
orderly
and
careful
about
the
way
it
does
its
work.
secondly,
the
theory
that
we
have
just
heard
essentially
amounts
to
a
freezing
theory,
that
the
pendency
of
a
lawsuit
does,
in
fact,
have
an
injunctive
effect,
as
it
were,
against
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it
no
longer
enjoys
liberty
to
regulate
the
public
lands.
and
thirdly
and
finally...
i
think
this
is
very
important...
what
the
ninth
circuit
concluded,
and
what
we've
heard
today,
is
that
congress
violated
the
separation
of
powers.
it
directed
courts
how
to
decide
a
lawsuit.
fair
reading
of
this,
including
the
language
that
hurts
me
the
most,
"determines
and
directs",
isn't
language
that
congress
uses
in
addresses
the
courts.
it
uses
the
word
"directs"
throughout
this
statute
when
it's
talking
to
those
of
us
who
have
to
listen...
the
forest
service
and
the
bureau
of
land
management.
it
wasn't
directing
a
decision.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
one
of
the
incongruities
of
the
statute.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
they
certainly...
since
the
days
of
schooner
peggy,
even
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
been,
certainly,
if
it
speaks
clearly,
it
has
the
ability
to
lay
down
a
rule
to
guide
decisions.
but
this
court
has
been
troubled
if
there
is
an
effort
by
congress
to
actually
step
in
and
to
direct:
john
smith
shall
win
this
particular
adjudication.
that
is
not
this
case.
