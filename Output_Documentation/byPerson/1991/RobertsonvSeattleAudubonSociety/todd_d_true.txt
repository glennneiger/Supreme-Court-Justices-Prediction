mr.
todd
d.
true
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
separation
of
powers
between
congress
and
the
judiciary
does
not
allow
congress
to
enact
a
statute
that
tells
the
courts
to
decide
a
specific,
pending
case
for
one
party
or
for
another
party.
on
that
point,
we
and
the
solicitor
agree.
section
318,
however,
steps
across
that
line,
because
what
it
does
is
tell
the
courts
how
to
decide
these
cases
and
only
these
cases
for
the
government,
for
a
year.
mr.
todd
d.
true
yes,
your
honor,
if
that
choice
is
available,
but
our
point
is
that
in
this
statute,
this
statute
that
congress
enacted,
all
of
the
indicia
in
the
statute
itself,
in
its
history,
all
fit
together
and
point
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
was
deciding
these
cases
for
a
year
in
enacting
this
statute.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
d.
true
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--yes.
i
agree
with
your
construction
of
the
second
sentence
of
subsection
(b)(6)(a),
that
what
it
is
in
effect
doing
is
saying
these
areas
of
the
forest,
these
particular
areas
of
the
forest,
are
off-limits
to
logging,
and
much
like
a
designation
of
an
area
as
a
wilderness
or
as
a
national
park,
there's
no
judicial
review
of
that.
the
congress
to
make
that--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--no,
it
is
not.
we
are
not
asking
about
what
happened,
or
we're
not
challenging
anything
that
happened
within
those
areas.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
legal
standards
that
guide
the
selection
of
individual
timber
sales
outside
of
those
areas
during
1990.
there
is
nothing
in
section
318
that
tells
the
agencies
which
particular
tracts
of
timber
to
select
during
1990.
the
standards
for
that
are
in
the
existing
environmental
laws.
that's
where
the
agencies
looked
to
decide
which
timber
sales
to
pick,
and
nothing
in
section
318
set
aside
or
repealed
or
amended
those
laws.
the
only
thing
in
section
318
that
tried
to
draw
a
link
between
section
318
and
the
existing
laws
is
the
phrase
in
(b)(6)(a)
that
says,
congress
determines
and
directs
that
these
actions...
that
is,
staying
outside
of
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5)...
will
meet
the
requirements
of
those
laws.
now,
that
is
a
key
indicator
that
congress
was
deciding
these
cases.
it
is
language
that
courts
might
use
in
deciding
a
case.
it
says
what
complies
with
the
law.
it
doesn't
change
or
amend
the
law.
now--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
was
an
inartful
means
of
identifying--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--it
is
certainly
an
amendment
to
an
appropriations
act--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--which
itself
indicates
that
this
shouldn't
automatically
be
read
as
an
amendment
to
the
substantive
law.
but
the
more
fundamental
point
is
that
we
can't
just
excuse
this
as
inartful
drafting
because
all
of
the
other
indicators
in
the
statute
and
its
history
point
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
intentional,
this
was
purposeful
to
decide
these
cases.
if
you
go
through
those
indicators,
the
statute
names
the
cases,
and
it
names
the
docket
numbers,
and
in
fact
it
names
a
particular
order
in
one
of
the
cases,
the
order
granting
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
todd
d.
true
first,
your
honor,
of
course
you
would
have
a
different
statute
than
the
one
before
you,
but
again,
you
would
use
the
same
approach.
you
would
look
at
all
of
the
indicators
in
the
statute.
if
everything
else
in
the
statute,
the
commentary
and
the
legislative
history,
the
parts
of
the
statute,
indicated
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
deciding
these
cases,
then
it
would
be
a
very
close
case.
but
you
might
even
conclude
that
language
like
"notwithstanding",
because
it
was
zeroed
in
only
these
cases,
you
might
conclude
that
congress
was
still
deciding
these
cases
by
acting
that
particular
law.
mr.
todd
d.
true
what
you
would
have
there
is
a
strong
indicator
that
congress
is
changing
the
law,
and
of
course
that's
what
this
is
all
about.
was
congress
changing
the
law,
or
was
it
telling
the
courts
how
to
apply
that
law
in
these
cases?
so
in
your
hypothetical,
you
would
have
one
strong
indicator
going
the
other
way.
you
don't
have
that
indicator
here.
you
don't
have
any
indicator
going
in
the
direction
of
changing
the
law
here.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
i
agree,
your
honor.
you
have
a
rule
of
construction,
but
that
rule
doesn't
overcome
the
clear
indications
of
the
statutes.
let
me
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
add
some
more
indicators
of
what
congress--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--it
places...
it
adds
the
additional
requirement
of
placing
certain
areas
of
the
forest
off
limits
to
logging
for
a
year.
it
doesn't--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--that
is
an
additional...
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
change
in
the
law,
but
it
is
not
a
change
in
the
law
that
affects
the
application
of
the
laws
that
we
had
based
our
claims
on
in
these
cases.
in
other
words,
the
agencies
can
stay
out
of
those
areas,
but
that's
maybe
20
percent
of
the
forest.
in
the
other
80
percent
of
the
forest,
they
still
have
to
decide--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--the
second
sentence
that
speaks
of
judicial
review
says
that
there
will
be
no
judicial
review
of
the
statutory
standards
in
(b)(3)
and
(b)(5).
it's
much
like
saying
that
this
is
our
decision
to
make,
that
these
areas
are
going
to
be
off
limits.
now,
if
you
go
back,
though,
to...
(b)(3)
changes
the
law
for
these
particular
areas,
but
then
what
it
does,
what
section
(b)(6)(a)
does
is
draw
a
link
between
that
change
and
the
existing
law,
and
it
says,
if
you
stay
out
of
these
areas
your
actions
everywhere
else
will
meet
the
requirements
of
the
existing
laws.
and
that
isn't
a
change.
that
language
doesn't
change
the
requirements
of
the
existing
law.
and
that's
what
these
cases
were
about,
was
enforcing
the
existing
environmental
laws
against
the
forest
service
and
the
bureau
of
land
management.
now--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
something
that
congress
can
do,
but
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
statute
as
to
whether
saying
something
like
that
is
simply
something
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do,
or
whether
it's
deciding
a
case.
in
the...
in
this--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--that
is
correct.
now--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--that
has
the
effect
of
deciding
a
particular
case,
but
it
also--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--well,
it
isn't
just
the
purpose
of
that
statute
to
decide
the
particular
case.
in
other
words,
if
you
go--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--if
it
were
exactly
identical
to
this
case,
it
had
the
same
claims
under
the
same
laws
against
the
same
agency
actions,
then
you
would
again
have
congress
determining
that
those
actions
meet
the
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
todd
d.
true
but
i
think
that--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--the
difference,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
that
in
your
hypothetical,
what
you
have
is
congress
saying
we...
you
have
indicators.
congress
is
saying,
we
didn't
mean
that
particular
criminal
statute
to
have
such-and-such
an
effect.
here,
it's
not
saying...
there's
no
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
or
anywhere
else
that
we
don't
mean
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to
do
what
it
does,
or
the
national
forest
management
act,
or
any
of
the
other
laws,
we
just
don't
like
the
result
that
the
court
has
reached
in
these
particular
cases
and
so
we're
going
to
tell
the
court
what
actions
meet
the
requirements
of
those
laws.
mr.
todd
d.
true
yes,
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--well,
they
did
make
the
designation,
and
they
did
preclude
judicial
review
of
that,
but
the
areas
that
they
designated
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
forest,
and
they
haven't
changed
or
specified
what's
to
happen
in
the
rest
of
the
forest.
mr.
todd
d.
true
if
it
didn't
designate
what
is
to
happen
in
the
rest
of
the
forest,
then
it's
the
existing
laws
at
issue
in
our
cases
that
determine
whether
the
actions
the
agency
takes
on
those
areas
of
the
forest
meet
or
don't
meet
the
requirements
of
the
law,
and
the
only
thing
that
tells
us
whether
this
statute
in
(b)(6)(a),
where
it
says
these
actions
meet
the
requirements
of
the
law,
attempt
to
tell
the
courts
what
actions
outside
the
areas
off
limits
meet
the
requirements
of
the
law.
that's
the
ruling
that
the
court
was
about
to
make
in
these
cases.
mr.
todd
d.
true
if
nothing
else
about
the
history
or
the
structure
or
any
other
aspect
of
the
statute
is
changed
except
that
you
have
a
listing--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--of
the
statutes...
now,
it
has
to
be
very
precise,
and
it
has
to
specify
a
number
of
other
things
that
get
you
to
these
cases...
it
applies
only
to
spotted
owls,
it
applies
only
to
logging,
and
so
on...
then
i
think
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
todd
d.
true
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
d.
true
in
fact,
this
statute
did
more
than
that.
it
did
focus
on
spotted
owls
and
loggings
and
these
cases.
for
example,
there
were
cases
that
went
forward.
mr.
todd
d.
true
yes,
your
honor,
and
cases
that
raised
challenges
under
these
same
statutes
to
other
activities.
mr.
todd
d.
true
your
honor,
i
believe...
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
if
what
you
have
in
the
legislative
history,
as
you
have
here,
is
a
focus
on
wanting
to
change
the
result
of
two
particular--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
todd
d.
true
no,
it
is
not
invalidated
by
the
legislative
history,
but
all
of
the
factors
here,
both
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
point
to
deciding
these
cases,
and
that's
crucial,
because
in
your
example,
if
you
change
one
of
those...
so
that
congress
is
talking
about
changing
the
law
in
the
legislative
history,
for
example...
you
have
a
different
case.
you
have
a
different
statute,
and
you're
not
just
focused
on
the
particular
result
in
these
cases
for
a
year.
mr.
todd
d.
true
it
does
make
some
difference
that
they
named
the
cases
and
the
orders
here,
because
that
makes
it
even
clearer
what
the
focus
of
the
statute
is.
it's
on
these
cases.
if
they
list
the
laws,
it
is
a
little
less
clear
that
they're
focused
on
these
cases
in
enacting
the
statute,
but
even
if
they
list
the
laws,
and
direct
what
actions
meet
those
laws,
and
in
fact
they
indicate
that
that
was
in
order
to
decide
a
particular
case,
i
still
think
you're
going
to
be
at
least
very,
very
close
to
the
separation
of
powers
line.
mr.
todd
d.
true
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
subjective.
it's
the
objective
indications
in
the
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
congress'
intent
to
change
the
outcome
of
these
cases
for
a
year.
it's
the
objective
indicators
of
that.
mr.
todd
d.
true
again,
you
would
have
a
different
case
than
the
case
before
you.
mr.
todd
d.
true
but...
okay.
the
answer
would
be
that
if
you
had
the
same
statute,
the
same
history,
and
congress
knew
that
the
case
was
going
to
be
filed
the
next
day
and
it
wanted
to
head
that
off,
you
might
well
have
a
separation
of
powers
violation
between
congress
and--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--let
me
back
up,
because
what
i
was
about
to
say
is,
the
more
likely
separation
of
powers
violation
you
have
at
that
point
is
congress
telling
the
executive
department
how
to
implement
the
laws.
mr.
todd
d.
true
in
a
specific,
focused
situation.
in
other
words,
for
example,
in
this
statute
if
what
congress
had
done
is
passed
a
law
that
said,
the
actions
of
the
forest
service
are
inadequate
to
meet
the
national
forest
management
act,
or
the
environmental
documents
at
issue
here
are
inadequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
i
think
there
you
would
again
have
no
change
in
the
law
but
just
a
direction
to
the
executive
department
to
go
back
and
try
again.
mr.
todd
d.
true
congress
doesn't
implement
the
laws.
it
sets
the
standards,
and
then
the
executive
branch
implements
the
laws.
if--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--if
its
focus
is...
if
it
has
no
focus,
no
attention
to
changing
the
laws,
it
just
wants
to
change
what
the
executive
branch
is
doing
to
implement
those
laws
in
a
particular,
specific
situation...
in
other
words,
it's
overruling
the
executive
branch's
exercise
of
its
authority
to
implement
the
laws...
then
i
do
think
that
you
have
a
different
separation
of--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--your
honor,
the
principle
that
congress
can't
decide
cases
and
that
it
can't
implement
the
laws
does
apply,
because
if
congress
can
control
specifically
how
individual
laws
are
implemented
in
individual
situations,
then
it
basically
has
complete
control
of
the
executive.
mr.
todd
d.
true
well,
that...
that
case
is
certainly
an
important
case
here,
and
particularly
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
powell
on
the
separation
of
powers
point,
because
this
is
very
like
what
happened
there.
mr.
todd
d.
true
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--no.
the
congress
can
certainly
go
and
designate
wilderness,
national
parks.
it
can
pass
a
new
law
that
says
there
shall
be
no
logging
on
blm
lands.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
is
correct,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
is...
that
is
true
in
this--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--that's
correct.
that
was
the
basis
that
the
court
decided
that
case
on.
mr.
todd
d.
true
your
honor--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--i
might
not
be
making
the
same
argument
because
there
i
have
something
that
indicates
that
congress
wanted
to
set
aside
the
laws,
repeal
the
laws,
instead
of
tell
the
courts
what
actions
meet
those
laws,
but
it
would
be
a
very
close
case--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--i
don't
think
the
language
is
readable
that
way
when
you
look
at
the
other--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--it
wanted
to
change
the
rulings
in
these
cases
so
there
weren't
any
injunctions
in
place.
mr.
todd
d.
true
your
honor,
if
that's
what
it
had
said,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
it
didn't
say
that.
mr.
todd
d.
true
it
did,
in
fact,
leave
those
statutes
in
place,
and
the
agencies
during
the
year
did
comply
with
them.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
decisions
to
sell
timber
during
1990
outside
these
areas
that
were
put
off
limits,
what
you
find
is
that
those
decisions
say...
they
go
through
and
say
this
decision
to
sell,
this
timber
sale,
complies
with
section
318,
and
it
complies
with
the
requirement
of
the
national
forest
management
act
to
protect
the
viability
of
these
species,
and
so
on.
but
we
don't...
but
they
didn't
have
to
worry
about
these
cases
because
congress
had
decided
those.
so
they
could
continue
to
follow
the
existing
law,
because
it
hadn't
been
changed.
mr.
todd
d.
true
there
may
be
those,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
but
i'm
certainly
not
aware
of
any,
and
there
are
none
that
the
solicitor
cites,
where
you
had
a
statute
where
congress
had
a
pending
case
and
it
focused
on
that
case,
and
it
said
certain
actions
are
going
to
be
adequate
to
meet
the
requirements
of
that
law.
all
of
the
deeming
statutes
that
the
solicitor
talks
about,
there
isn't
a
pending
case
out
there
saying
these
actions
don't
meet
the
law.
mr.
todd
d.
true
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
question.
first,
there
were
no
vested
rights,
say,
for
example,
by
any
timber
companies
to
log
in
any
of
these
areas
that
were
put
off
limits.
there
are
no
vested
rights
to
log
on
the
public
lands
at
all.
mr.
todd
d.
true
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
laws
that
say
how
logging,
if
it's
going
to
happen,
is
to
proceed,
but
this
law
is
not
about
prospective
conduct,
except
for
conduct
that
the
court
was
judging
in
this
case.
mr.
todd
d.
true
my
point--
mr.
todd
d.
true
--my
point
is
that
it
might
not
make
a
difference
if
congress
happened
to
use
the
words
"notwithstanding",
or
"hereby
repealed"
for
these
particular
activities
in
these
particular
states
or
this
particular
year
under
these
particular
circumstances,
because
then...
and
you
have
legislative
history
that
says
we're
doing
this
"repeal",
quote,
as
you
do
here,
because
we
want
to
change
the
injunctions
in
two
pending
cases.
so
it
might
not
make
a
difference
if
that
language
of
repeal
gets
used.
it's...
in
every...
as
this
court
has
said
every
time
it
has
looked
at
a
statute
under
the
separation
of
powers,
each
statute
has
to
be
addressed
individually
and
on
its
own.
there
aren't
bright
lines
and
automatic
rules
here.
you
have
to
look
at
the
indicia
in
each
statute
of
what
the
statute
is
doing.
and
if
you
go
through
those
here,
what
you
find
is
that
this
statute
is
deciding
these
cases.
