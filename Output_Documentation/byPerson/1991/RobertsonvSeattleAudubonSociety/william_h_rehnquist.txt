chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
90-1596,
robertson
v.
seattle
audubon
society.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk.
the
court
remains
in
session.
general
starr,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
starr,
what
do
you
think
the
klein
case
stands
for
as
perhaps
an
irreducible
minimum?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
true,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
true,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
if
there
is
a
choice
of
possible
interpretations
of
this
statute
and
one
of
them
would
make
it
constitutional
and
one
not,
we
should
choose
the
one
which
would
make
it
constitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
only
one
way
to
construe
the
statute,
in
your
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
does
that
all
the
time,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
forbidden
to
congress
for
doing
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
think
congress
could
say
that
they...
to
the
people
in
the
bureau
of
land
management
or
the
forest
service
that
with
respect
to
particular
determinations
you've
made
under
the...
for
nepa,
they
are
inadequate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
klein
applies
not
simply
where
congress
tries
to
tell
the
judiciary
what
to
do,
but
where
it
tries
to
tell
the
executive
what
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
congress
can
also
say
what
used
to
be
a
wilderness
area
is
no
longer
a
wilderness
area.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
true.
mr....
general
starr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1596,
robertson
versus
seattle
audubon
society
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
