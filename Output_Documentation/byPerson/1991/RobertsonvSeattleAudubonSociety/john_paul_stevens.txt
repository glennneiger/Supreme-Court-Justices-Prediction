justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
can't
resist
asking
you
this
question
as
kind
of
a
predicate
to
the
whole
argument.
do
you
think
this
is
a
plain
language
case
or
a
holy
trinity
case?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
not
limited
to
the
plain
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
the
congress
hereby
determines
and
directs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
even
more
limited
than
that?
new
law
for
a
particular
territory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
we
can
appropriately
examine
those
materials
in
solving
this
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
agree
with
that
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt,
if
i
may.
would
you
not
agree
that
if
your
theory
of
the
law
as
expressed
in
the
underlying
litigation
was
correct,
that
this
statute
has
the
effect
of
changing...
assuming...
has
the
effect
of
changing
the
law
applicable
to
the
part
of
the
controversy
that
you
are
involved
in,
geographically
and
temporally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
doesn't
that
constitute
a
change
in
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
starr,
can
i
ask
you
one
point
of
information.
in
the...
you've
emphasized
subparagraph
(f)
in
(b)(3)
as
the...
is
there
a
counterpart
to
subparagraph
(f)
in
(b)(5)?
