sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
starr,
isn't
it
entirely
possible
that
it
could
be
read
as
having
congress
distinguish
between
designation
of
lands
for
lumbering
or
conservation
and
the
implementation
of
timber
sales
or
conservation
programs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
other
words--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
could
be
read,
it
seems
to
me,
as
saying
that
the
congress
has
designated
certain
lands
for
this
1
year
as
being
available
or
not
available
for
timbering.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
leaving
the
discretionary
administrative
decisions
to
implement
the
laws
in
place.
is
that
not
possible...
i
don't
think
that's
the
reading
you've
given
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
i
think
that
is
a
plausible,
possible
reading.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
starr,
let
me
ask
it
this
way.
does
anything
in
subsection
(b)(3)
or
(b)(5)
conflict
with
the
statutes
under
which
respondents
in
this
case
brought
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
if
what
i
suggested
to
you
is
the
meaning,
the
cases
are
not
over
either,
even
for
the
year.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
it
could
be
constructed
in
the
way
i
suggested
to
general
starr
that
it
just
deals
with
the
congressional
designation
of
certain
lands
within
which
timbering
could
be
held
or
which...
in
which
it
could
not
be
used
for
timbering
for
1990.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
leaving
in
place
all
the
management
and
administration.
is
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
designation
at
issue
in
the
suits
that
are
pending?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
it
was
just
an
inartful
means
of
identifying
a
list
of
statutes
that
it
wanted
affected.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
this
provision
enacted
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
the
last
minute,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
fair
description.
if
you
read
the
conference
report,
it
says
in
reference
to
this
that
it
intended
for
the
fiscal
year
'90
to
protect
more
habitat
than
had
currently
been
provided
under
the
plans,
and
the
conference
report
went
on
to
say
this
section
in
no
way
alters
application
of
the
endangered
species
act
or
other
environmental
laws
to
forest
service
and
blm
management
activities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
all
that
they
were
doing
is
making
a
congressional
designation
of
more
habitat
area,
then
i
suppose
there's
nothing
the
matter
with
their
shorthand
description
in
this
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
saying
perhaps
congress
didn't
go
on
and
say
what
was
to
happen
in
the
rest.
perhaps
all
it
did
here
was
designate
habitat
and
preclude
review
of
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
congress
lacks
power
to
designate
certain
areas
of
federal
forest
land
within
which
it
will
allow
or
not
allow
timbering
by
specific
designation,
even
though
that
designation
may
conflict
with
what
the
blm
or
the
forest
service
was
going
to
designate,
or
had
designated?
you
think
congress
lacks
the
power
to
say
no,
we
don't
like
that,
and
we're
going
to
designate
sections
so-and-so
and
so-and-so
and
so-and-so
as
habitat.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
argument
sounds
very
much
like
you
say
that
would
not
be
permitted
constitutionally.
did
you
mean
to
say
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it
conflicts
entirely
with
what
its
administrative
agencies
might
have
chosen
to
designate.
