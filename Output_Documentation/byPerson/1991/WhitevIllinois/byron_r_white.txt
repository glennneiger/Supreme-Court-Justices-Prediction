justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
argue
that
the
same
result
would
obtain
here
if
the
child
hadn't
been
available?
i
mean,
you
did
make
the
child
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
be
arguing,
and
making
the
same
argument,
i
suppose,
if
the
child
hadn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--hadn't
even
been
in
town.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fact
that
the
child
was
in
the
courtroom
doesn't
help
your
case
very
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
help.
how?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
that
relevant
to
the
confrontation
clause
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
be
a
confrontation
issue,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
see
it,
as
the
case
comes
here,
we
judge
it
on
the
basis
that
all
these
statements
were
within
some
recognized
hearsay
exception
because
that...
that
is,
the
case
isn't
challenged.
justice
byron
r.
white
while
i
have
got
you
interrupted,
would
you
think
the
prosecution
would
have
to
have...
make
the
child
available
in
the
courtroom?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
defense
says,
well,
we
notice
that
the
child
isn't
in
the
courtroom.
we
would
like
to
ask
the
prosecution,
is
the
child
available?
and
the
prosecution
says,
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
prosecution
offers,
and
it
has
admitted
an
out-of-court
statement
that
no
one
would
claim
was
within
the
recognized
hearsay
exception.
well,
that
person
who
made
the
statement
is
no
more
a
witness
for
confrontation
clause
purposes
as
some
other
one.
so
the
limit
on
that
sort
of
evidentiary
error
is
the
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
this
is
a
state
court
and
the
state
court
has
got
a
rule
of
evidence,
for
example,
they
just
admitted
it,
and
they,
for
some
reason,
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction.
if
we
were
going
to
reverse
it,
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
due
process
issue,
i
suppose.
