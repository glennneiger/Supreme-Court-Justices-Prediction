mr.
peterson,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
o'connor
suggested
that
you
could
have
called
the
child
to
the
stand
yourself.
could
you
have
done
that
during
the
prosecution's
case
or
could
you
have
only
done
that
during
the
defense
case
as
a
witness
on
your
own--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
defendant
could
only
do
it
during
the
defense
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
that
if
you
wanted
to
file
a
motion
for
acquittal
in
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
case,
you
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
child
at
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
have
some...
i
know
that
your
opponent
hasn't
differentiated
among
the
five
statements
here,
but
wouldn't
you
have
some
difficulty
with
a
police
officer's
statement
under
a
spontaneous
declaration,
if
he
came
in
and
questioned
the
child?
that
is
hardly
spontaneous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
responding
to
questions
from
a
police
officer
45
minutes
after
the
event
falls
squarely
within
the
spontaneous
declaration
exception?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
for
the
admissibility
of
statement
a,
you
can
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
is
consistent
with
other
statements
that
are
admissible,
can
they
buttress
admissibility
in
that
way?
maybe
they
buttress
probative
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
could
you
have
had
one
3
or
4
weeks
later,
a
whole
series
of
statements
that
were
all
consistent
but
not
within
any
exception
other
than
being
consistent...
no
exception
for
consistent
statements.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
answer
to
my
question,
that
the
defendant
could
not
have
cross-examined
the
child
during
the
prosecution's
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--than
the
person's
testimony
2
years
later,
but
certainly
i
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
confrontation
clause
analysis
and
our
sense
of
what
it
ought
to
mean
to
permit
that.
so
it
is
not
just
reliability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
understand
the
position
in
your
brief,
even
if
the
state
were
doing
that,
evidence
would
still
be
admissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
state
could
have
put
the
person
on,
but
just
decided
technically
it
would
be
better
not
to,
and
even
arranged
for
the
child
to
be
in
europe
or
someplace,
what
would
be
the
result
of
those
facts?
would
the
hearsay
come
in
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
illinois
wouldn't
do
anything
like
that,
no--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
consider
it
as
though
the
state
had
hid
the
witness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
point
is,
if
there
is
no
unavailability
requirement,
there
is
no
reason,
at
least
in
the
sixth
amendment,
to
prevent
the
state
from
doing
precisely
that.
we
just
discard
availability
as
any
relevant...
for
any
relevant...
relevant
purpose
under
sixth
amendment
analysis
of
hearsay
exception.
i
thought
that
was
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
nightingale,
in
this
case
we
have
got
two
exceptions.
one
is
the
well-recognized
spontaneous
one
and
the
other
is
the
physician
exception
which
as
i
understand
it,
in
illinois
it
was
pursuant
to
a
1988
statute.
what
leeway
does
the
state
have
in
creating
new
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well...
the
doctor,
which
is
a
little
bit
novel--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
real
question,
to
get
to
the
heart
of
it,
do
you
think
it
has
to
be
historically
recognized,
or
is
it
sufficient
if
you
come
up
with
a
new
exception
that
seems
to
be
totally
reliable
and
sensible?
what
would
your
views
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
an
evolving
definition
of
what
is
admissible.
i
thought
it
was
the
government's
position
that
this
material
is
not
really
covered
by
the
confrontation
clause
anyway.
are
you
abandoning
that?
