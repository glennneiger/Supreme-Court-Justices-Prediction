mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
government's
submission
in
essence
is
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
in
every
meaningful
sense
from
inadi.
inadi
makes
clear
that
the
rule
of
necessity
that
the
court
had
outlined
in
ohio
v.
roberts
is
reserved
for
the
situation
in
which
the
government
attempts
to
admit
hearsay
which
is
essentially
a
less-desirable
substitute
for
live
testimony,
and
that
rationale
is
just
as
inapplicable
to
the
statements
before
the
court
today
as
it
was
to
the
coconspirator
statements
involved
in
inadi.
the
decisive
feature
of
the
statements
involved
in
inadi,
the
court
said,
was
that
they
were
made
in
a
context
very
different
from
trial
which
gave
them
special
evidentiary
significance,
and
the
same
can
fairly
be
said
of
the
two
hearsay
exceptions
before
the
court
today.
state
and
federal
rules
of
evidence
firstly
provide
for
the
admission
of
excited
utterances.
after
many
years
of
experience
with
those
sorts
of
statements,
a
consensus
has
emerged
that
statements
made
while
a
person
remains
under
the
emotional
influence
of
a
startling
event
have
special
reliability.
those
statements
are
made
at
a
point
when
the
person's
memory
is
as
clear
as
it
will
ever
be,
and
before
there
has
been
an
opportunity
for
conscious
revision
or
external
influence.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
at
some
point,
certainly,
a
state
court
finding
that
a
statement
was
an
excited
utterance
would
take
it
so
far
beyond
the
accepted
core
definition
of
that
hearsay
exception
that
it
could
no
longer
be
regarded
as
firmly-rooted.
the
court
has
dealt
with
similar
situations,
for
instance,
in
dutton
v.
evans
where
a
state
was
admitting
coconspirator
statements
that
were
not
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
but
rather
during
the
so-called
concealment
phase
of
the
conspiracy.
there
was
also,
actually
the
name
of
the
case
escapes
me
right
now,
but
the
point
is
that
if
a
state
application
of
a
hearsay
exception
takes
it
outside
the
accepted
firmly-rooted
definition,
then
the
court
could
appropriately
consider
the
particular
application.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
wouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
every
parent
who
has
told
a
child
that
the
doctor
has
instructed
the
child
to
eat
his
or
her
vegetables
knows
that
a
doctor
has
a
particular
standing
in
a
child's
life.
it
is
an
authority
figure,
a
benign
figure
who
is
viewed
as
someone--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--again,
there
comes
a
time
when...
when
the
child
is
incapable
of
perhaps
making
a
reliable
statement,
but
certainly
that
is
not
the
case
here.
and
i
think
that
a
child
of
very
young
years...
children,
many
children
are
taken
to
the
doctor
beginning
at
a
point
when
they
are
days
old
and
continuously,
and
i
think
by
2
years
old,
most
children
recognize
the
role
that
the
doctor
plays
in
their
lives.
i
would
like
to
return
briefly
to
the
police
officer
statements,
statements
to
the
police
officer
here.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
indication
that
that,
the
admission
of
those
statements
was
in
any
way
outside
the
mainstream
of
excited
utterances.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
agree
with
your
honor,
and
not
only
that,
within
the
core
of
the
accepted
hearsay
exceptions
there
was
evidence
here
that
the
child
had
been
awoke,
had
been
awoken
at
4:00
a.m.
in
the
morning,
that
she
had
been
restrained
in
a
way
that
caused
injuries
to
her
face,
that
she
had
been
crying
very
hard,
and
accepting
as
well
her
account
of
what
happened
to
her,
i
think
it
was
well
within
the
trial
court's
discretion
to
conclude
that
the
state
of
excitement,
which
is
essentially
the
guarantee
of
reliability,
persisted
for
45
minutes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
don't
believe
it's
required.
in
inadi,
the
holding
was
that
it
is
not
necessary
as
a
precondition.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
secure
a
subpoena
and
the
state
then
has
an
obligation
to
use
reasonable
efforts
to
secure
the
child's
production
at
that
point.
so
that
that
is
the
mechanism
through
which
the
child
is
brought
to
the
courtroom
if
the
defendant
desires.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
the
state
had,
before
the
statute
was
passed,
a
case
law--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--so
that
this
was
not
in
any
sense
a
novel
application
even
in
illinois--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--but
again,
the
hearsay
rule
has
undergone
a
relatively
constant
period
of
evolution.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
and
over
time
certain
exceptions
which
are
widely
recognized,
many
times
codified--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
think
when
the
new
exceptions
achieve
some
general
degree
of
acceptance,
i
wouldn't
put
any
great
weight
on
any
particular
set
of
hearsay
exceptions
that
existed
at
an
arbitrary
point
in
the
past.
i
think
that
recent
developments
in
which
rulemakers
have
made
efforts
to
codify
the
best
of
what
experience
has
brought
forward
are
the
best
indications
of--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--no.
it's
our
position
that
the
case
can
be
decided
within
the
framework
of
inadi
and
in
addition,
we
think
that
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
opportunity,
if
it's
inclined
to
do
so,
to
consider
whether
every
out-of-court
hearsay
declarant
is
in
fact
a
witness.
it
is
our
position
that
the
language
of
the
clause
and
the
historical
context
from
which
it
emerges
supports
the
view
that
it
was
designed
essentially
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
an
abuse
that
had
characterized
some
notorious
english
trials.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
true.
there
are
two
grounds
available.
perhaps
the
narrower
ground
is
simply
to
apply
inadi
to
these
facts.
these
hearsay
exceptions
admit
evidence
having
the
same
sort
of
independent
evidentiary
significance
as
in
inadi.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
green,
no,
because
i
think
green
involved
out-of-court
statements
that
were
prior
testimony
and
statements
to
authorities
in
a
legal
context.
but
certainly
in
inadi,
yes,
under
our
view,
the
threshold
question
would
be,
were
the
statements
made
the
absent
coconspirator
made
by
a
witness?
under
our
analysis,
the
answer
would
be
no,
and
it
would
be
unnecessary,
therefore,
to
consider
other
issues.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that
and
the
fact
that
the
rules
of
evidence
are
a
two-way
street--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--that
would
be
so.
thank
you
very
much.
