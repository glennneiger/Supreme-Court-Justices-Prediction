justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
peterson,
you
are
seeking
to
rely
on
the
constitutional
provision,
but
the
constitutional
provision
doesn't
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
you
except
where
the
information
is
reliable.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
means
what
you
say,
i
don't
know
how
we
get
the
right
to
balance
the
interests
that
you
are
talking
about
and
say,
well,
some
hearsay
exceptions
are
okay
because
although
we
don't
give
them
the
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
them,
that
is
okay
because
we
think
the
information
is
reliable.
where
do
we
get
that
kind
of
a
right
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
go
back
a
long
way,
and
it
has
always
been
the
tradition
in
our
courts
that
there
are
hearsay,
that
there
are
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
those
exceptions,
many
of
them
were
in
existence
when
this
provision
was
adopted.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
it
was
intended
to
overrule
them.
maybe
the
solution
lies
in
the
word
witnesses.
what
constitutes
a
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
couldn't
witness
against
you
mean
the
persor
who
testifies
before
the
jury,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
other
evidence
against
you,
but
the
only
witnesses
against
you
are
the
people
who
appear
in
court,
and
you
have
the
right
to
confront
them
and
to
cross-examine
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
add
that.
any
witness
who
appears
in
person
or
any
witness
who
provides
an
affidavit
for
the
specific
use
of
the
court
at
this
trial.
this
still
wouldn't
fall
within
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
whether
it
is
a
witness
against
you
or
not.
it
doesn't
say
all
evidence
against
him,
it
says
the
witnesses
against
him,
and
you
are
saying
that
anything
that
somebody
says
outside
of
court
which
is
used
against
you
at
a
trial
renders
that
person
a
witness
against
you.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
self-evident
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
wouldn't
throw
away
the
hearsay
rule.
we
would
still
have
the
hearsay
rule
in
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
would
still
have
the
hearsay
rule
in
their
trials.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
hearsay
rule.
we
are
talking
about
the
confrontation
clause.
what
is
the
minimum
guarantee
of
the
confrontation
clause?
and
i
suggest
it
may
extend
to
nothing
except
witnesses
in
the
formal
sense,
somebody
who
appears
at
trial
or
someone
who
makes
a
deposition
or
signs
an
affidavit
in
preparation
for
the
trial.
that
would
make
the
confrontation
clause
make
sense,
and
the
states
could
continue
to
apply
the
hearsay
rule.
we
wouldn't
stop
that,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
have
a
due
process
clause
too,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no
vaguer
than
what
you
have
turned
the
confrontation
clause
into.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
anderson,
i
would
like
to
get
your
response
to
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
peterson.
if
you
acknowledge
that
the
child,
when
making
these
declarations
to
the
policeman
or
to
the
physician
or
whoever,
is
a
witness,
where
do
we
get
the
authority
to
allow
that
to
come
in
so
long
as
it
is
reliable,
since
as
i
read
the
constitution,
you
are
entitled
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
you,
unless
of
course
the
witnesses
are
reliable,
in
which
case,
you
are
not
entitled
to
be
confronted.
where
do
we
get
the
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
are
you
sure
it
would
come
in
if
the
state
had
actually
taken
the...
if
the
state
is
hiding
the
witness,
the
witness
is
not
unavailable.
i
mean,
as
i
understand
your
position,
if
the
witness
is
either
there
or
unavailable,
it
should
come
in,
but
if
the
witness
is
neither
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--nor
unavailable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
state
is
hiding
the
witness,
the
witness
is
not
really
unavailable.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
the
witness
is
not
really
unavailable
if
the
state
has
spirited
the
witness
off
to
some
foreign
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
think
the
child
was
contemplating
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
when
you
say,
when
the
government
says
in
contemplation
of
litigation,
i
think
it
means
to
say
that
the
declarant
is
contemplating
litigation,
and
so
it
is
at
a
deposition,
the
declarant
knows
the
deposition
is
going
to
be
used
in
later
litigation
or
something
of
that
sort.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
declarant
was
not
contemplating
litigation,
is
there?
