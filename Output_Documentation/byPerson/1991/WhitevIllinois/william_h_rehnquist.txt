we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-6113,
randall
d.
white
v.
illinois.
mr.
peterson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
two
declarations
were
both
admitted
by
the
illinois
courts
under
what?
one
was
considered,
one
set
was
a
spontaneous
declaration,
and
the
other
was
statements
made
by
while
submitting
yourself
for
a
medical
examination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
peterson,
you
are
assuming
that
even
though
there
is
a
well-recognized
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
law
of
evidence,
nonetheless,
the
confrontation
clause
requires
that
the
witness
speak
from
the
stand.
certainly
in
inadi,
we
would
held
that
was
not
true
of
declarations
of
coconspirators.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
one
place
where
the
government
would
not
have
to
show
that
they
are
unavailable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
aren't
these
well-recognized
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
too,
the
spontaneous
declarations
principle
and
the
testimony
or
declarations
made
while
submitting
yourself
for
a
medical
exam?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
is
your
authority
from
this
court
for
saying
that
any
time
the
state
or
government
wants
to
offer
hearsay,
they
have
to
show
either
that
the
witness
is
unavailable
or
bring
the
witness
to
the
stand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
what
case
is
interpreting
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
peterson.
ms.
anderson,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
as
true
of
a
5-year-old
child,
ms.
anderson,
as
it
would
be
of
an
adult
making
a
statement
to
a
doctor
in
the
course
of
getting
treatment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
state
were
to
spirit
a
witness
away,
there
might
be
a
violation
of
some
other
principle
of
the
sixth
amendment,
i
suppose
the
right
to
call
a
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
anderson.
mr.
nightingale,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
peterson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
peterson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
90-6113,
white
against
illinois
and
here,
petitioner
randall
white
was
convicted
in
an
illinois
state
court
of
sexually
assaulting
s.g.,
the
initials
given
to
a
four-year-old
girl
to
protect
her
anonymity.
in
the
minutes
immediately
following
the
assault,
s.
g.
told
her
babysitter,
her
mother,
and
a
police
officer
that
petitioner
had
assaulted
her.
several
hours
later,
while
at
the
hospital,
she
repeated
her
account
to
a
nurse
and
to
a
doctor.
s.g.
never
testified
at
the
trial.
however,
over
petitioner's
objection,
the
prosecutor
called
to
testify
each
of
the
five
people
who
had
heard
s.g.'s
story
and
that
each
repeat
the
statements
that
s.g.
made
about
the
assault.
these
statements
were
admitted
by
the
trial
judge
under
two
state
law
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
excluding
hearsay
evidence.
one
that
permits
witnesses
to
repeat
statements
made
by
another
person
while
that
person
was
excited
and
another,
permitting
witnesses
to
testify
about
statements
by
another
while
that
person
was
in
the
course
of
securing
medical
treatment.
petitioner
appealed
his
conviction
claiming
that
the
trial
court
violated
his
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
as
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
by
allowing
this
testimony.
the
illinois
appellate
court
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
this
question.
we
hold
that
petitioner's
confrontation
right
was
not
violated
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
illinois
court.
we
reject
the
argument
advanced
by
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
that
no
violation
occurred
here
because
the
confrontation
clause
is
generally
not
intended
to
apply
to
hearsay
testimony.
we
think
such
an
argument
comes
too
late
in
the
day
given
the
court's
long
history
of
recognizing
that
hearsay
testimony
may
often
implicate
confrontation
clause
concerns.
nonetheless,
while
hearsay
statements
do
raise
these
concerns,
we
conclude
they
are
admissible
based
on
a
firmly
ridded
exception
to
the
prohibition
against
receipt
of
hearsay
testimony.
such
exceptions
like
the
two
involved
here
provide
alternate
guarantees
of
trustworthiness
such
that
the
requirement
for
in-court
testimony
of
the
decelerant
may
be
dispensed
with
even
if
she
is
available.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
