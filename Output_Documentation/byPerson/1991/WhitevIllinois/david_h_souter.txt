justice
david
h.
souter
what
exactly
did
you
want
the
state
to
do
that
it
did
not
do?
it
had
the
child
in
the
courtroom.
the
defense
could
have
called
the
child
for
cross-examination.
the
state
apparently
made
some
sort
of
an
attempt
to
get
the
child
on
the
stand,
and
the
briefs
simply
refer
to
the
child
as
failing
to
take
the
stand,
and
i
am
not
sure
why.
i
can
guess,
but
i
don't
know
why.
what
should
the
state
have
done
that
it
did
not
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
statement,
that
the
child
failed
to
take
the
stand
had
been
supplemented
in
effect
by
a
court
finding
that
the
child
could
not
testify
for
whatever
reason,
as
a
matter
of
capacity,
emotional
condition
and
whatnot,
that
then
would
have
satisfied
the
unavailability
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
now
what
if
the
child
had
been
available
and
the
only
thing
the
state
wanted
was
to
use
the
hearsay
statements.
was
the
state
supposed
to
call
the
child
to
the
stand,
say
we
have
no
questions,
you
may
cross-examine?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
mean
that
they
can't
introduce
hearsay
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
then
would
be
satisfactory
to
you?
would
the
state
have
had
to
call
the
child
and
simply
attempt
to
get
the
child
to
repeat
the
hearsay
statements
or
in
effect,
to
testify
from
the
stand
what
the
child
had
said
to
the
third
parties?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
state
has
no
option?
it
has
got
to
do
that?
