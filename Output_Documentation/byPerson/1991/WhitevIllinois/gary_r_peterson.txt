mr.
gary
r.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
confrontation
clause
permits
the
prosecution
to
substitute
hearsay
for
the
live
testimony
of
a
child
witness,
absent
a
showing
that
the
child
is
unavailable
to
testify
at
trial.
the
issue
arose
in
this
case
at
the
defendant's
trial
on
the
charges
of
sexual
assault
and
other
related
offenses.
the
alleged,
victim.
s.g.,
who
was
5
years
old
at
the
time
of
trial,
did
not
testify.
instead,
the
prosecution
relied
upon
hearsay
testimony
that
merely
related
s.g.'s
unsworn,
out-of-court
accusations
against
the
accused.
based
on
this
evidence,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
offense
as
charged.
the
illinois
appellate
court
affirmed
the
defendant's
conviction.
the
illinois
supreme
court
denied
the
appeal
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
this
case
presents
conflicting
considerations.
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
the
defendant's
convictions
were
premised
on
the
out-of-court
accusations
of
a
single
witness.
because
the
child
did
not
testify,
the
defendant
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
his
only
accuser.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
right,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
the
state's
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
child
witness.
it
is
a
difficult
experience
for
a
child
to
testify
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
of
course,
the
same
can
be
said
for
the
elderly,
the
mentally
impaired,
victims
of
sex
crimes,
victims
of
violent
crimes,
and
others.
however,
since
our
adversary
system
expresses
a
strong
preference
for
confrontation
at
trial,
this
court
has
held
that
competing
interests
must
be
closely
examined,
and
any
exception
to
the
confrontation
right
must
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
under
illinois
law
he
has
the
right
to
call
witnesses
as
if
under
cross-examination.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
no,
it
wasn't.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
waiver.
all
the
hearsay
testimony
was
objected
to
at
trial.
the
defendant
moved
for
a
mistrial
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
child
did
not
testify.
the
waiver
argument
was
presented
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
the
illinois
appellate
court
found
it
necessary
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
in
what,
i
must
say,
is
a
very
forceful
opinion.
that
constitutional
opinion
is
now
the
law
in
the
state
of
illinois,
and
it's
persuasive
authority
in
other
jurisdictions
as
well.
and
i
submit,
it
is
the
constitutional
issue
that
is
now
presented
here.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
state
is
the
proponent
of
the
hearsay
evidence
in
this
case,
and
the
burden
is
on
the
proponent
of
that
evidence
to
establish
the
proper
predicate
for
its
introduction.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
your
honor,
the
predicate
for
establishing
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
evidence
under
these
circumstances
is
prior
to
introducing
the
evidence,
the
state
must
either
establish
that
the
child
is
unavailable
or
elicit
that
child's
testimony
from
the
stand.
what
we
suggest
the
state
should
have
done
is
to
prior
to
introducing
this
evidence,
requested
a
hearing
and
presented
evidence
on
the
issue
of
unavailability
so
the
trial
court
could
make
a
finding,
at
which
point
the
record
would
clearly
show
one
way
or
the
other
if
the
child
was
available
to
testify
or
not.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
certainly,
by
a
trial
court
finding,
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
the
confrontation
clause
requires
that
the
defendant
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
i
suggest
that
that
indicates
that
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
must
come
from
the
witness
stand,
under
oath,
and
be
subject
to
cross-examination.
i
suggest--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--no,
i
don't.
if
the
child
testifies,
certainly
the
hearsay
is
properly
admissible,
or
if
she
is
unavailable,
the
hearsay
is
admissible.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
the
confrontation
clause
requires
that
the
prosecution
produce
the
witnesses
against
the
defendant,
and
i
suggest
that
means
that
they
produce
the
testimony
of
those
witnesses.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--they
are
well-recognized
exceptions.
i
would
submit
in
this
case
that
the
appellate
court
applied
a
broad
interpretation
of
those
exceptions.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
the
confrontation
clause,
sir--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--i
would
suggest
maryland
v.
craig,
where
this
court
balanced
the
competing
interests
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
craig,
of
course,
concerned
a
closed-circuit
television
procedure
wherein
the
child
was
permitted
to
testify
outside
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
i
believe
that
was
idaho
v.
wright.
craig--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
and
in
craig,
even
though
the
child
was
under
oath
and
subject
to
cross-examination,
this
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
procedure
infringed
upon
the
defendant's
confrontation
right
because
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
personally
face
his
accuser,
and
this
court
held
that
this
exception
to
the
confrontation
right
could
be
justified
only
upon
a
case-specific
finding
of
necessity.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
no.
in
inadi,
this
court
balanced
the
competing
interests,
but
the
competing
interests
in
that
case
were
much
different.
inadi
dealt
with
the
testimony
of
a
coconspirator.
of
course,
a
coconspirator
is
often
antagonistic
to
the
prosecution.
because
he
is
often
facing
indictment
himself,
he
is
likely
to
lie
under
oath
in
an
attempt
to
save
his
own
skin.
under
those
circumstances,
the
necessity
of
the
case
indicates
that
the
coconspirator's
testimony
would
not
aid
the
truth-seeking
process,
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
the
prosecution
cannot
realistically
be
required
to
vouch
for
the
credibility
of
the
coconspirator.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--generally--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--certainly
the
hearsay
rule
recognizes
that
these
exceptions,
hearsay
is
more
reliable
than
hearsay
generally.
however,
the
confrontation
clause
does
not
guarantee
the
defendant
reliable
evidence
or
even
the
best
evidence.
it
guarantees
him
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him,
and
no
matter
how
reliable
the
evidence
is,
there
is
no
justification
for
denying
the
defendant
his
right
to
present
a
defense.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
he
could
call
the
child
under
the
compulsory
process
clause,
but
there
are
two
separate
rights.
there
is
compulsory
process
for
calling
witnesses
in
your
favor,
and
then
there
is
the
confrontation
right
which
requires
that
the
defendant
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
well,
business
records,
i
don't
think
you
can
characterize
that
as
a
witness
against.
in
this
case,
the
child
witness,
upon
whose
accusations
the
state
is
relying
to
obtain
the
defendant's
conviction
is
certainly
a
witness
against
the
accused.
we
are
dealing
with
accusatory
testimony.
in
dealing
with
business
records
and
some
other
exceptions,
we
are
not
dealing
with
accusatory
testimony,
and
it's
questionable
whether
the
confrontation
clause
is
even
applicable
in
those
situations.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
personally,
i
tend
to
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
however,
the
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
maryland
v.
craig
indicate
that
the
hearsay
rule
is
not
absolute
and--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--well,
certainly
a
witness
against
the
accused
must
include
the
person
whom
whose
out-of-court
statements
the
prosecution
is
relying
to
obtain
the
defendant's
conviction.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
the
confrontation
clause
was
intended
to
prohibit
trials
by
affidavit,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
intended
to
prohibit
trials
by
anonymous
accusers
and
absentee
witnesses.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
well,
in
essence,
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
is
similar
to
testimony
that
comes
under
oath
because
they
are
both
considered
reliable.
but
in
this
case,
we
say
affidavits
can't
be
relied
upon,
but
yet
here
we
have
unsworn
verbal
hearsay
that
is
being
relied
upon
to
obtain
the
defendant's
conviction.
that
is
no
more
reliable
than
an
affidavit.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
well,
again,
your
honor,
i
would
note
that
as
we
have
recognized,
the
hearsay
rule
was
intended
to
prevent
trials
by
anonymous
accusers
and
what
we
have
in
this
case--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--let
me
suggest
a
possibility.
if
that
were
the
interpretation
adopted
by
this
court,
a
state
could
pass
a
statute
that
said,
all
hearsay
is
admissible
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
including
rumor,
innuendo,
double,
triple,
quadruple
hearsay.
a
conviction
obtained
under
such
a
statute
would
be
exempt
from
confrontation
clause
scrutiny
unless
the
person
who
made
the
rumor
was
considered
a
witness
against
the
accused.
and
of
course,
rumors
are
usually
not
made
in
contemplation
of
litigation.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
rather
vague.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
the
confrontation
clause
does
say
that
the
defendant
shall
be
given
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
the
state
is
relying
upon
the
child's
out-of-court
accusations
to
obtain
the
defendant's
conviction.
this
is
the
primary
evidence
against
the
accused
and
is
it
the
evidence
upon
which
the
conviction
is
based.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
the
defendant
could
only
have
done
that
during
his
case
in
chief,
and--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--that's
right.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
of
course,
the
logical
extension
of
such
a
procedure
where
the
defendant
is
not
permitted
to
call
the
witness
until
his
case
would
be
the
prosecution
could
put
on
the
direct
testimony
of
all
of
its
witnesses
and
prevent
the
defendant
an
opportunity
of
cross-examining
any
witnesses
until
his
case
in
chief.
and
such
a
procedure
would
certainly
be
unfair,
and
i
suggest
violate
the
constitution.
for
these
reasons,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
remand
this
case
for
a
new
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
respond
again
to
the
suggestion
that
the
child
was
not
a
witness
against
the
accused.
under
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
someone
is
a
witness
against
the
accused
if
they
give
testimony
or
they
give
statements
in
contemplation
of
litigation.
and
i
would
suggest,
even
under
that
approach,
the
child
in
this
case
was
a
witness
against
the
accused.
a
police
officer
interviewed
the
child
45
minutes
after
the
alleged
incident.
at
that
time
the
police
officer
was
aware
than
an
allegation
of
a
crime
had
been
made.
the
child
at
this
point
was
no
longer
excited,
and
the
police
officer
testified
that
she
was
calm.
he
asked
the
child
leading
questions
and
she
responded.
i
would
suggest
that
these
statements
fit
the
definition
of
being
made
in
contemplation
of
litigation.
in
addition,
last
year
in
idaho
v.
wright,
this
court
applied
confrontation
clause
analysis
to
almost
the
exact
situation
we
have
here,
statements
by
a
child
to
an
examining
physician.
in
this
case--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--no.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
i
would
agree
with
that,
and
under
that
approach,
i
would
suppose
that
a
child
would
never
be
considered
a
witness
against
the
accused,
as
children...
most
of
their
statements,
i
would
suggest,
may
never
contemplate
that
they
will
be
made
in
contemplation
of
litigation.
and
i
would
also
note,
and
in
this
case
the
doctor
who
interviewed
the
child
testified
that
he
took
notes
in
contemplation
of
litigation,
that
is
at
volume
6,
page
63
of
the
record.
there
has
also
been
much
discussion
about
the
inherent
reliability
of
the
statements
admitted
in
this
case.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
statements
to
the
police
officer
which
were
admitted
under
the
spontaneous
utterance
exception,
the
basis
for
that
is
the
child
is
excited.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
child
was
no
longer
excited
at
this
point.
the
police
officer
said
she
was
calm
and
certainly
the
statements
were
not
spontaneous.
they
were
made
after
she
had
talked
to
two
others,
and
in
response
to
leading
questions.
also,
the
statements
to
the
nurse
and
the
doctor.
under
similar
circumstances
in
idaho
v.
wright,
this
court
held
that
statements
such
as
these
were
unreliable.
the
basis
for
that
exception
relates
to
the
details
relating
to
medical
treatment.
however,
in
this
case
the
appellate
court
made
a
broad
interpretation
that
allowed
the
details
of
the
alleged
offense,
and
under
these
circumstances,
i
would
suggest
that
the
statements
in
this
case
do
not
fit
the
historical
hearsay
rationale.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
