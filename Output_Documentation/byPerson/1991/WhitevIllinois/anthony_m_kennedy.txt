i
am
still
not
sure
how
you
answer
the
chief
justice's
question,
and
how
you
would
distinguish
inadi
because
here...
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
is
closer
to
inadi
because
we
have
a
well-recognized,
firmly-rooted
hearsay
exception,
and
inadi
makes
it
quite
clear
that
unavailability
is
not
a
requisite.
so
are
you
saying
that
we
should
cut
back
on
inadi
somehow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
of
illinois
has
a
hearsay
exception
for
child
testimony--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
was
not
invoked
in
this
case,
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
draw
any
inference
from
that,
that
the
unavailability
could
not
be
shown?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
would
take
it
that
it
would
cover
kinds
of
testimony
that
would
not
be
covered
by
spontaneous
declaration
or
medical
testimony,
i.e.--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
the
child
made
the
report
2
weeks
later
when
it
couldn't
be
a
spontaneous
declaration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
not
just
reliability.
assume
that
someone's
deposition
is
taken
right
after
a
crime,
that
there
is
even
cross-examination
where
that
memory
is
fresh.
i
think
you
could
make
a
very
good
argument
that
that
is
more
reliable--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
always
a
replacement
for
the
out-of-court
declarant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
really
an
independent
argument
from
the
line
of
reasoning
you
were
pursuing
with
justice
stevens?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
adopted
your
suggested
formulation
in
this
second
respect,
this
broader
formulation,
i
take
it
we
would
render
irrelevant
much
of
the
analysis
in
inadi
and
green?
