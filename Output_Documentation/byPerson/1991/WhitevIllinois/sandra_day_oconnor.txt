justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
peterson,
i
understand
that
in
this
case
the
child
victim
was
actually
in
the
courtroom.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
that
in
illinois
the
defendant's
attorney
could
have
called
that
child
for
cross-examination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
that
was
not
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
a
waiver
here,
then,
of
this
so-called
right
of
confrontation?
i
mean,
that
could
have
been
asserted
at
the
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
craig
involved
a
residual
hearsay
exception.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
state
offered
the
testimony.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
we
have...
craig
was
the
television
set?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
peterson,
don't
you
have
similar
reasons
at
stake
here?
isn't
it
more
likely
that
the
excited
utterance
made
at
the
time
of
the
traumatic
event
is
more
likely
to
be
true
than
the
subsequent
testimony
in
court,
months
or
perhaps
years
later,
and
the
same
with
statements
made
to
obtain
medical
treatment,
speaking
generally--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
think
the
justification
for
both
of
those
hearsay
exceptions
would
be
that
those
statements
are
more
likely
to
be
true
than
anything
that
would
be
produced
in
the
courtroom.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
defendant
here
had
every
opportunity
to
call
this
child.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
if
you
were
correct,
then
it
wouldn't
even
be
possible
to
offer
business
records
in
any
criminal
case.
that
would
never
come
in.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
nightingale,
what
about
the
statement
that
was
made
45
minutes
later
to
the
policeman.
suppose
it
had
been
3
days
later
or
whatever
scenario
you
might
imagine.
at
some
point,
i
guess,
one
could
say
that
perhaps
excited
utterance
exceptions
shouldn't
cover
it,
but
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
how
do
you
deal
with
that
in
the
context
of
the
confrontation
clause
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
there
is
some
question
here
about
statements
of
a
very
young
child
to
a
doctor.
it
is
not
clear
that
a
child
would
see
the
same
need
for
honest
statements
to
obtain
treatment
that
an
older
person
might
experience.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
is
true
of
a
child
of,
let's
say,
2
years
of
age?
