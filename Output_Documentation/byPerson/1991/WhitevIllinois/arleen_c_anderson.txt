ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
illinois
submits
this
morning
that
the
court's
reasoning
in
united
states
v.
inadi
applies
to
this
case
as
well.
the
petitioner
proposes
that
the
rule
of
necessity
laid
out
by
the
court
in
maryland
v.
craig
is
applicable
to
this
case,
and
we
submit
that
its
reliance
on
craig
is
misplaced.
craig
involved
a
procedure
used
by
the
state
which
was
intended
solely
to
replace
in-court
testimony,
so
as
to
avoid
live,
face-to-face
confrontation
with
the
defendant.
and
it
makes
sense
that
a
rule
of
necessity
would
apply
in
a
situation
like
that,
and
the
court
has
in
fact
held
that
a
rule
of
necessity
does
apply
to
hearsay
which
is
intended
solely
to
replace
live,
in-court
testimony
and
specifically
that
is
former
testimony.
but
most
admissible
hearsay
is
not
simply
a
substitute
for
live
testimony.
it
has
independent
probative
value
which
is
derived
from
the
circumstances
under
which
is
it
made.
for
example,
let's
look
first
at
spontaneous
declarations.
because
of
their
immediacy
and
the
stress
the
declarant
is
under
after
experiencing
a
startling
event,
the
statements
are
such
that
they
are
irreplaceable
as
probative
evidence.
the
value
of
that
evidence
cannot
be
duplicated
on
the
stand.
with
respect
to
statements
made
for
purposes
of
medical
treatment
or
diagnosis,
a
person
speaks
differently
when
consulting
a
doctor
for
treatment
or
diagnostic
purposes
than
when
testifying
on
the
stand,
and
those
statements
also
are
irreplaceable
as
substantive
evidence.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
a
child,
even
at
a
young
age
such
as
4
or
5,
understands
that
when
he
or
she
is
going
to
the
doctor
they
are
going
to
an
authority
figure
and
that
they
are
going
for
a
certain
reason,
that
is,
to
obtain
help.
the
court
has
under
the
confrontation
clause
put
some
restrictions
on
this
particular
type
of
hearsay
that
does
have
independent
probative
value,
and
mainly
the
court
has
focused
on
the
reliability
of
the
statement,
and
the
effect
that
any
cross-examination
might
have.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
yes,
they
do--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case.
i
think
that
the
prosecution
just
decided
that
they
had
statements
that
were
squarely
within
these
particular
exceptions
and
didn't
feel
that
it
had
to
resort
to
the...
it
is
more
or
less
a
residual
exception
just
for
children
in
abuse
cases.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
well,
it
was
still
made
during
the
period
when
this
child
was
still
under
the
stress
of
this
event.
all
of
the
statements
were
made
within
45
minutes
of
this
event,
and
i
submit
that
this
child,
especially
at
this
young
age,
was
still
under
stress
and
trauma
of
the
event.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
i
think
that
there
are
other
indications
of
reliability.
the
statements
were
all
consistent.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
no,
i
am--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
there
are
certain
cases
where
the
state
courts
have
expanded
the
exceptions
and
in
cases
such
as
that,
it
does
probably
bring
the
reliability
of
the
statement
into
question,
and
in
cases
like
that,
the
defendant
would
probably
want...
want
to
cross-examine
the
child
and
he
has
every
right
to
do
so.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
i
agree
with
that,
yes.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
it
is
just
based
on
prior
case
law,
your
honor.
and
the
state
of
illinois
assumes
for
purposes
of
argument
today
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
reliability
requirement
that
is
derived
from
the
confrontation
clause.
a
literal
reading
of
the
confrontation
clause,
as
you
are
speaking
about,
would
call
into
question
whether
or
not
s.g.
was
actually
a
witness
for
purposes
of
the
confrontation
clause,
and
the
state
of
illinois
probably...
if
we
weren't
taking
the
position
of
assuming
that
she
was
a
witness...
would
probably
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
question
there
as
to
whether
the
confrontation
clause
does
actually
apply
to
a
hearsay
declarant.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that
is
reliable--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--that's
true.
it
is
not
just
reliability.
it's
actual
face-to-face
confrontation,
and
as
long
as
the
state
is
not
trying
to
submit
evidence
which
is
intended
solely
as
a
replacement
for
live
in-court
testimony,
say,
as
the
situation
was
in
maryland
v.
craig
with
the
closed-circuit
television
procedure,
then
we
are
not
going
to
have
a
problem
with
the
confrontation
clause.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
it's
a
replacement,
but
it
is
not
intended
solely
as
a
replacement.
when
the
statement
is
made,
that
is
not
the
purpose
in
mind.
the
statement
is
admissible
and...
the
statement
comes
in
because
it
is
made
under
circumstances
that
give
it
independent
probative
value
that
can't
be
duplicated
on
the
witness
stand.
if
i
could
just
go
on,
this
court
has
specifically
held
that
once
reliability
is
shown
with
a
hearsay
statement,
either
because
it
comes
in
under
a
firmly-rooted
exception
or
particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness
are
found,
that
statement...
it's
sufficiently
clear
that
that
statement
is
trustworthy
enough
that
cross-examination
would
probably
be
of
marginal
utility.
now
if
that's
the
case
and
these
hearsay
statements
are
going
to
come
in,
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
a
blanket
rule
requiring
the
state
to
produce
the
declarant
each
and
every
time
it
wants
to
admit
a
hearsay
statement?
as
the
court
noted
in
inadi,
such
a
rule
wouldn't
actually
work
to
keep
any
evidence
out.
the
statement
will
come
in
if
the
declarant
is
shown
to
be
unavailable
or
it
will
also
come
in
if
he
is
available
and
produced
for
trial.
the
court
also
noticed...
noted
in
inadi
that
such
a
rule
wouldn't
enhance
the
rule-seeking
process
over
and
above
what
exists
without
it.
if
the
prosecution
doesn't
call
a
declarant,
and
for
all
practical
purposes
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
prosecution
will
by
and
large
call
a
complaining
witness
or
an
eyewitness
to
help
prove
its
case,
but
there
are
going
to
be
certain
circumstances
where
the
state
may
feel
that
the
witness
would
not
be
exceptionally
effective,
or
in
the
case
of
small
children,
possibly
the
prosecutor
would
want
to
keep
the
child
from
being
put
in
a
traumatic
situation.
and
if
that
is
the
case,
but
the
defendant
still
feels
that
he
needs
to
call
this
witness,
he
can
certainly
do
so
under
the
compulsory
process
clause.
but
the
state
submits
that
these
cases
where
the
state
does
decide
not
to
call
a
complaining
witness
or
a
victim
as
in
this
case,
and
the
defendant
does
feel
that
the
testimony
will
be
of
some
value
to
him,
those
cases
are
so
small,
so
small
in
number
that
it
doesn't
justify
changing
the
law
as
it
now
stands
to
require
the
state
to
produce
the
declarant
with
these
particular
types
of
statements
each
and
every
time
it
decides
to
enter
one
of
these
statements
into
evidence.
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point,
and
that
is
the
effect
that
such
an
unavailability
rule
would
have
on
the
courts.
the
effect
on
the
courts
up
to
this
time
has
been
minimal
because
the
necessity
rule
has
only
applied
to
cases
involving
prior
testimony.
but
if--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--the
prosecution
did
try
to
put
her
on
the
stand,
yes.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
it
would
be
the
same
argument,
yes.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
basically,
yes,
it's
the
same
argument,
that
the
compulsory
process
clause
would
provide
the
defendant
enough
protection
if
he
decided
that
he
did
want
to
call
the
witness.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
it
certainly
helps
our
case.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
it
shows
that
the
state
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
call
this
witness.
it
demonstrates
that
by
and
large
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
state
will
call
witnesses
of
this
type.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
it
is
relevant
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant
is...
it's
implying
that
the
state
is
trying
to
get
in
certain
evidence,
hearsay
statements
of
this
kind
just
to
avoid
putting
these
witnesses
on
the
stand,
and
that's
not
the
case.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--under
our
position,
yes,
the
hearsay
would
come
in.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
but
i
want
to
assure
you
that
for
all
practical--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--no,
illinois
wouldn't--
[laughter]
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
had
hid
the
witness?
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
no.
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
you
should
consider
the
case
from
that
perspective.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true,
if
we
are
assuming
that
an
unavailability
requirement
applies--
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
--right.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true.
that's
true,
but
also
that's
speaking
from
the
assumption
that
an
unavailability
requirement
is
necessary
in
order
to
comply
with
the
confrontation
clause.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
unavailability
requirement
is
constitutionally
mandated
if
the
evidence
is
intended
solely
to
replace
live
testimony,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
purposes
of
the
confrontation
clause
demand.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
that's
true.
ms.
arleen
c.
anderson
i
don't
think
so.
the
state
of
illinois
submits
that
there
has
been
no
showing
by
the
defendant
of
a
sufficient
justification
for
a
rule
such
as
he
proposes,
and
we
therefore
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
appellate
court.
