mr.
michael
dean
ray
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
preliminary
question
in
a
(b)(6)
balancing
test
is,
is
the
privacy
interests,
if
any
at
stake,
a
substantial
privacy
interest.
so
i
would
like
to
take
a
second
to
look
at
the
text
of
the
actual
reports
in
this
case
so
we
can
see
exactly
how
private
these
interviews
were.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
these
interviews
were
not
private
but
that
they
were
totally
public.
for
example,
these
documents
appear
in
the
record
below
at
entry
45.
on
page
80,
quote,
"blank
took
embassy
official
to
a
large
house
near
the
village
market,
where
large
numbers
of
people
soon
gathered.
"
"as
word
spread
of
the
presences,
many
returnees
came
forward
to
be
interviewed.
"
page
81,
quote,
"several
of
the
villagers
suggested
that
embassy
official
next
go
to
a
community
called
grand
paque
several
miles
from
jean
dani.
"
"once
there,
embassy
official
waited
at
a
large
house
while
several
people
went
out
to
look
for
those
known
to
be
returnees.
"
"within
the
hour,
about
20
migrants
had
come
forward
to
be
interviewed.
"
"while
interviewing
the
returnees,
villagers
of
all
ages
gathered
to
stare
at
the
unexpected
event.
"
page
90,
quote,
"embassy
official,
department
official,
were
escorted
through
the
village
by
numerous
children
and
directed
to
a
small
hut
where
the
villagers
gathered
to
stare
at
the
visitors.
"
"word
was
passed
to
known
migrants,
and
they
arrived
from
their
work
in
the
field
after
20
minutes.
"
and
the
last
one
at
82,
quote,
"on
the
return
to
jean
dani,
several
people
stopped
the
embassy
car
to
be
interviewed.
"
"three
saw
the
car
coming
and
crossed
a
large
irrigation
ditch
to
get
to
the
car.
"
end
of
quote.
this
i
submit
shows
a
totally
different
picture
from
what
the
government
claims
at
page
7
in
their
reply
brief,
quote,
"the
inherently
sensitive
nature
of
the
state
department's
efforts
to
monitor
human
rights
practices
at
haiti
provides
undeniable
justification
for
conducting
these
interviews
in
confidence.
"
these
interviews
were
not
conducted
in
confidence.
they
were
conducted
out
and
open
on
the
streets
of
these
little
villages
and
hamlets
and
mud-thatched
houses
where
many,
many
people
in
those
towns
knew
what
was
going
on
and
knew
who
these
people
were.
it's
also
evident
from
the
record
that
people
in
these
villages
knew
who
these
people
were
when
they
left
haiti
and
when
they
came
back
and
when
they
were
interviewed.
so
i
would
submit
that
the
privacy
interests
at
stake
in
this
case
is
as
the
district
court
found,
de
minimis.
however,
assuming
that
this
court
finds
that
there
is
significant
or
substantial
privacy
interests,
then
i
believe
that
this
court,
in
applying
the
balancing
test,
would
certainly
find
that
the
public
interest
in
disclosure
far
outweighs
any
privacy
interests.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
yes,
i
do.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
that
question,
so
i'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
it.
but
to
answer
your
previous
question
as
to
whether
i
believe...
whether
the
government
is
abandoning
the
balancing
test,
i
believe
that
they
are.
the
government
alleges
here
that
there
is
no
public
interest
because
names
in
and
of
themselves
do
not
shed
light
on
government
conduct,
and
therefore
the
government,
they
claim,
does
not
even
have
to
address
whether
there
is
a
privacy
interest
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
suggestion
that
this
court
abandon
the
balancing
test.
and--
mr.
michael
dean
ray
--i
believe
that
the
eleventh
circuit
performed
the
balancing
test
here,
and
in
doing
so,
the
limits
are,
as
in
this
case,
when
the
government
uses
the
information
that
is
requested
for
public
purposes,
then
the
public
interest
is
heightened.
and
the
specific
uses
in
this
case
which
the
government
uses
that
information,
these
reports,
are
for...
what
they
have
done
already
is
they
have
interdicted
22,000
haitians
on
the
high
seas,
and
they
have
used
these
reports
specifically
to
send
those
people
back
to
their
country.
they
have
used
these
reports
to
create
advisory
opinions
in
every
haitian's
asylum
claim
in
all
the
immigration
courts
throughout
the
united
states.
and
they
are
still
doing
that
today
in
1991.
to
say
that
if
you
are
afraid
to
go
back
to
your
country
because
you
fear
you'll
be
mistreated
for
having
left
illegally,
that
claim
is
unfounded.
however,
as
state
department
official
eaves
swore
to
the
contrary.
this
information,
he
said,
was
old
and
outdated
and
of
no
value
to
an
asylum
claim.
i
believe
here
this
information
that
we
request
has
been
used
in
such
public
fashion
that
the
public
interest
is
so
heightened
above
just
any
request
whatsoever
to
monitor
some
government
conduct.
here
this
information
is
used
daily
in
the
courts,
the
federal
courts,
in
the
immigration
courts,
in
advisory
opinion,
to
send
haitians
back
to
their
country,
to
deport
them,
to
deny
their
asylum
claims.
so
that
i
believe
is
the...
are
the
factors
that
the
eleventh
circuit
use
in
their
balance
to
conclude
that
the
public
interests
outweighed
any
privacy
interests.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
but
the
government
i
don't
believe
has
not
used
the
census
information
to
send
back
22,000
people
on
the
high
seas
or
to
deport
them
or
to
deny
their
asylum
claims.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
i
don't
distinguish
it.
perhaps
that
should
be
disclosed.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
if
they
were
equally
as
important,
then
the
public
interest
and
the
balancing
test
would...
that
is
the
workable
formula
that
congress
intended
that
has
worked
fine
ever
since
1966
when
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
enacted.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
it's
important
to
know
whether
or
not
these
people
are
being
mistreated
and
that
asylum
claims
are
being
decided
fairly.
and
then
when
22,000
people
are
stopped
on
the
high
seas,
that
they
are
being
sent
back
for
reasons
that
are
true
and
correct.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
not
any
information.
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
to
double-check
because
the
government
has
abandoned
its
interview
program
specifically
because
it's
said
it's
too
costly
and
time
consuming.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
no,
it's
not
because
as
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
there's
also
a
great
public
interest
in
knowing
whether
or
not
the
government
is
telling
the
truth
about
fulfilling
its
obligations.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
yes.
under
the
law,
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
even
if
we
find
out
that
the
government
is
telling
the
truth,
we
still
have
a
right
to
that
information,
to
determine
for
ourselves.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
well,
no.
that
is
the
public
interest
in
this
case.
however,
i
have
other
purposes
myself
for
use
of
this
information
in
immigration
proceedings
in
the
immigration
courts
of
this
country.
however,
what
you
stated
is
correctly,
i
believe,
the
public
benefits
to
the
release
of
this
information.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
it
would
be
an
expansion
of
the
freedom
of
information
act?
mr.
michael
dean
ray
well,
there
have
been
many
cases
where
names
have
been
released,
specifically
in
reference
to
the
release
for
monitoring
government
compliance.
and
one
example
is
justice
scalia's
opinion
in
arieff
case
where
he
stated
that
the
core
of
the
freedom
of
the
information
act
is
to
monitor
government
compliance.
we
tried
to
get
other
names
in
this
case
on
our
own,
apart
from
these
582
persons
that
the
government
had
alleged
to
have
interviewed
upon
their
return.
i
have
filed
requests
for
seven
or
eight
boatloads,
names
and
addresses
and
other
identifying
information,
of
haitians
who
were
interdicted
on
the
high
seas.
and
the
government
has
refused
to
provide
that
information.
so
i
can't
go
in
another
way
to
find
out
that
information.
and
people
who
were
stopped
on
the
high
seas...
it's
ironic...
the
haitians
who
were
stopped
on
the
boats
specifically
are
not
promised
any
confidentiality
whatsoever
in
spite
of
about
a
7-year
effort
by
the
united
nations
to
attempt
to
get
immigration
to
promise
these
people
confidentiality.
yet,
in
those
cases,
and
they
are
both...
well,
one
is
on
appeal
now
because
the
government
has
asked
for
a
stay
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
it
was
granted
because
the
government
argued
that
the
issues
are
identical,
even
though
no
confidentiality
was
promised.
and
that
case
is
ray
v.
immigration
&
naturalization
service,
89-288
civil,
judge
ryskamp.
and
there's
another
case
where
two
other
boatloads
of
names
and
addressees
were
requested
where
no
confidentiality
was
promised.
and
that
is
still
pending,
and
that
is
90-1721,
civil,
judge
davis.
and
these
are
both
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
so
the
issue,
i
think,
which
that
shows
is
that
the
government
is
really
trying
to
argue
is
not
to
protect
confidentiality
and
privacy,
but
rather
to
protect
their
own
confidentiality.
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
only
is
designed
to
protect
individual
privacy,
and
not
government
privacy.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
also
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
the
privacy
interests
at
stake
here
are
the
declarations
of
three
state
department
employees.
and
the
first
one
by
a
mr.
eaves
specifically
states
that
the
release
of
the
requested
information
in
this
case
would
cause
possible
embarrassment.
would
cause
possible
embarrassment
does
not
meet
the
burden
of
proof
under
exemption
(b)(6)
which
requires
what
would
result
would
be
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy.
the
other
two
affidavits
submitted
do
not
even
talk
at
all
about
personal
privacy.
they
only
address
issues
of
foreign
policy
and
national
security.
and
as
this
court
has
already
ruled,
those
issues
are
no
longer
before
this
court.
so
even
by
the
own
government's
evidence
presented
in
this
case,
they
have
not
meant
their
burden
of
showing
that
the
privacy
interests,
if
any
in
this
case,
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
well,
i
think
it's
very
important
in
the
context
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
especially
because
in
the
past,
the
government
has
gone
before
congress
and
has
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
have
congress
write
out
the
(b)(6)
exemption
requirement
and
to
allow
the
government
to
only
have
to
show
that
a
privacy
interest
could
be
infringed
upon,
rather
than
that
it
would
be
or
clearly
would
be.
and
they
were
unsuccessful.
and
therefore,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
reporters
committee,
there
is
a
very
distinct
difference
between
exemption
7(c)
and
(b)(6).
so
i
think
in
this
context
you
have
to
look
specifically
at
what
the
government
has
proffered
for
their
argument
as
to
why
they
have
met
the
burden.
and
they
haven't
met
it
here.
it's
just
simply
not
met.
i
believe
the
government
is
trying
to
create
a
new
exemption
that
does
not
exist
under
the
law.
the
text
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
very
clear
at
552,
subsection
(d),
where
it
states,
"this
section
does
not
authorize
withholding
of
information
or
limit
the
availability
of
records
to
the
public,
except
as
specifically
stated
in
this
section.
"
and
there
is
no
such--
mr.
michael
dean
ray
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
in
each
case,
you
perform
the
balancing
test
after
you
determine
that
there
is
a
privacy
interest
involved.
you
then
look
to
see
if
there's
a
public
interest.
and
you
weigh
and
consider
the
two
and
decide
which
one
outweighs
the
other,
no
matter
whether
it's
a
hole
document
or
part
of
a
document.
however,
i
do
know
that
if
a
part
of
a
document
can
be
segregated...
it's
nondisclosable...
then
the
government
has
the
duty
to
do
that
and
disclose
the
part
that
is
segregable.
and
this
court
has
recognized
also
what
the
statute
says.
many
of
the
justices
here
have
recognized
in
prior
decisions
that
unless
congress
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
has
created
a
specific
exemption,
that
this
court
will
not
read
one
into
the
law,
which
the
government
is
asking
them
to
do
today.
justice
o'connor
recognized
that
in
her
dissent
in
the
abramson
case.
justice
scalia
recognized
that
in
his
dissent
in
the
john
doe
case,
as
well
as
justice
blackmun
in
his
majority
opinion
in
that
case.
so
there
is
no
categorical
exemption.
however,
i
would
submit
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
buy
the
government's
argument
that
there
should
be
a
new
rule
of
derivative
use,
that
we
have
met
our
burden
of
proof
under
that
standard.
because
contrary
to
the
government's
assertion
in
its
brief
that
the
only
information
redacted
here
are
the
names,
it
is
clear
by
looking
at...
and
that's
in
the
last
page
of
the
rely
brief...
it
is
clear
by
looking
at
the
reports
themselves
that
there
are
other
factors,
other
information
that
has
been
deleted
here
as
well,
such
as
addresses
and
places
where
people
lived.
now,
there
is
no
indication
from
these
reports
that
the
government
ever
went
to
any
prisons
to
see
if
anyone
were
incarcerated
as
a
result
of
having
left
their
country
illegally.
if
anyone
were
likely
to
have
been
persecuted,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
most
likely
place
to
look
to
find
out
whether
they
were
persecuted
or
not,
would
be
in
a
jail.
and
in
fact,
chief
judge
james
lawrence
king
in
the
southern
district
of
florida,
in
the
case
of
hrc
v.
civiletti,
503
f.
supp.
442,
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
1980,
recognized
specifically
in
that
case
there
was
much
evidence
presented
of
the
state
department's
manner
of
interviewing
returnees.
but
the
fact
that
the
state
department
did
not
check
with
prisons
made
their
methods
fatally
inadequate.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that's
another
factor
here
which
shows
why
there
is
such
a
large
public
interest
in
obtaining
these
names,
so
that
we
can
verify
the
fate
of
these
returnees.
because
the
government
has
not
done
so.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
i
cannot
tell
that
because
at
some
points
there
are
several
pages
that
are
left
blank,
and
i
have
no
idea
what
is
included
in
there.
there
are
other
places
specifically
where
i
can
tell
for
sure
that
what
has
been
omitted
are
names
of
addresses
and
places.
if
you
want
any
examples,
i
have
them
all
here.
but
it's
in
there.
if
you
look
at
those
documents,
they
have
left
out
other
information,
such
as
names...
other
than
names,
such
as
addresses
and
names
of
towns.
and
i
have
no
idea
what
they
have
left
out.
page
20
of
those
documents
at
record
reference
4520,
21,
22,
23
and
19.
the
whole
pages
are
empty.
who
knows
what
was
left
out?
we're
just
asked
to
take
the
government
at
its
word.
the
affidavit
by
i
believe
mr.
melton
of
the
state
department,
when
he
says
conditions
have
so
changed
in
haiti
that
these
reports
are
no
longer
of
any
value,
well,
then
why
did
the
state
department
stop
following
up
and
checking
to
find
out
what
the
fate
of
these
returnees
is?
and
since
they
don't
know,
then
how
can
they
send
advisory
opinions
to
the
immigration
courts
today
in
1991,
like
you'll
see
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
appendix
1a
saying
that
we
know
these
people
don't
have
any
fear
that
they
are
going
to
be
mistreated
when
they
go
back
because
we
did
interviews
in
1982
and
'83.
how
would
they
know?
it's
just
simply
not
possible.
so
the
government
has
not
done
an
effective
follow-up.
we
are
here.
we
are
the
follow-up
program.
we
are
the
only
way
to
determine
whether
these
people's
fate
is
as
the
government
states.
and
whether
the
government
is
telling
the
truth
or
not,
we
certainly
have
cause
to
question
that,
and
we
certainly
have
the
right
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
find
that
out.
i
would
just
state
also
that
when
the
persons
who
are
not
promised
not
confidentiality
aboard
the
interdicted
vessels
are
brought
back
to
haiti,
their
names
aren't
protected
in
confidence.
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
when
they
are
sent
back
to
the
dock
in
haiti,
their
names
are
given
on
11
lists
to
the
haitian
authorities.
and
immediately
after
that,
an
embassy
official
sits
in
on
interviews
with
these
individuals
with
the
haitian
police,
the
haitian
red
cross,
the
haitian
military,
and
the
haitian
executive
department.
i
submit
that
that's
further
evidence
that
what
the
government's
interest
here
is
is
not
interest
in
protecting
the
privacy
of
these
individuals.
and
also
if
it's
true
as
the
government
states
that
not
one
of
these
people...
or
i've
heard
now
that
perhaps
there
was
one
who
was
mistreated...
if
no
one
was
mistreated,
then
why
on
earth
would
they
be
afraid
to
come
forward
and
admit
what
they
said
previously?
and
not
only
that,
they
could
always
say
no.
they
don't
have
to
talk
to
use
if
they
don't
want
to.
but
all
we're
asking
for
is
the
same
information
that
has
already
been
given
to
the
haitian
police
and
the
haitian
military
and
the
haitian
red
cross
and
the
haitian
executive.
we're
asking
for
names
that
have
already
been
given
to
the
only
people,
if
there
are
any,
who
likely
would
be
persecutors.
there
is
no
means
to
verify
this
claim.
there
is
no
other
avenue
where
we
can
go
to
find
out
by
some
other
means
whether
this
is
true
or
not.
the
government
states
in
its
brief
that
cooperation
with
the
united
states
is
not
often
liked
and
these
people
might
be
treated
if
the...
oh,
i'm
sorry...
if
the
government
finds
out
they
spoke
to
them.
well,
again,
i
would
just
submit
that
if
no
one
was
mistreated
as
the
government
says,
then
i
would
think
the
government
of
haiti
would
honor
these
people
and
praise
them
for
being
such
positive
supporters
of
the
government.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
the
haitian
military,
red
cross,
police,
and
executive
have
the
names
of
the
22,000
haitians
who
were
brought
back
on
the
boats.
and
the
government
has
admitted
that
the
582
people
they
interviewed,
that
the
names
of
those
people
were
obtained
from
these
interdiction
lists.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
well,
we
do,
i
believe,
based
on
the
fact
of
the
manner
in
which
these
interviews
were
conducted
totally
out
in
the
open,
in
the
hamlets
and
in
the
villages,
where
these
interviews
were
done
so
publicly
that
many,
many
people
in
those
villages
know
who
they
are
and
it's
no
secret.
one
other
important
thing
is
that
one
of
the
documents
released
in
this
case,
it's
called
a
fact
sheet,
and
it's
for
use
as
far
as
telling
interviewers
how
to
question
these
interviewees.
and
one
of
the
things
that
it
states
in
there
is
be
sure
and
ask
these
people
whether
or
not
they
have
been
treated
by,
quote,
unquote,
"the
civilian
militia".
now
the
government
has
admitted
in
its
brief
that
the
tonton
macoutes,
the
secret
policy
in
haiti,
were
at
the
time
of
duvalier,
the
relevant
time
to
this
case,
that
they
were
the
civilian
enforcers
of
the
law.
so
the
interviewers
have
been
instructed
to
specifically
ask
these
people
if
they
have
been
mistreated
by
the
civilian
enforcers
of
the
law.
this
is
in
the
fact
sheet,
the
guidelines.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
actual
reports
themselves,
i
believe
i
found
in
only
one
place
any
reflection
that
anybody
was
ever
asked
if
they
were
mistreated
by
anyone
other
than
government
officials.
and
that
is
another
basis,
i
would
submit,
to
show
how
unreliable
these
studies
are.
because
the
people
who
are
most
likely
to
mistreat
these
individuals,
if
anyone,
are
the
civilian
enforcers
of
the
law,
as
the
government
has
recognized.
so
there's
no
question
about
that.
however,
the
government...
there's
no
evidence
that
they
even
bothered
to
ask
these
people
if
they
were
mistreated
by
these
persons.
yet
they
ask
the
court
to
take
their
word.
they
ask
the
american
public
to
take
their
word.
and
many,
many
of
these
documents
show
that
a
large
scheme
of
the
state
department
is
to
disseminate
these
results
to
the
public,
to
the
media,
even
to
congress.
and
these
documents,
if
you
look
at
them,
specifically
state
that
in
great
detail
how
they
have
a
need
to
target
audiences
in
miami
and
washington
and
in
new
york
where
there
are
many
haitians,
in
order
to
dispel
the
notion
in
their
minds
that
when
haitians
return
to
haiti,
they
are
going
to
be
mistreated.
and
the
same
documents
which
state
the
government's
need
to
inform
the
people
in
these
areas,
state
that
they
know
that
these
conceptions
are
not
true
because
the
state
department
has
done
these
interviews.
again,
for
all
the
reasons
that
i've
submitted,
these
interviews
are
just
not
accurate.
and
again,
we
don't
have
to
prove
the
government's
wrong
here,
or
that
they
are
not
telling
the
truth.
we
have
just
shown...
i
hope
i
have
shown
to
you...
how
important
these
public
interests
are
and
how
many
questions
there...
that
have
been
raised
by
the
government's
own
reports
as
to
whether
or
not
their
conclusions
really
are
true.
it
is
true
that...
i
don't
remember
the
exact
quote...
something
like,
great
nations
like
great
men
must
be
able
to
be
taken
at
their
word,
and
i
believe
that
also
applies
to
our
state
department,
because
we
are
talking
here
not
about
one
person's
case
or
one
person's
right;
we're
talking
about
perhaps
the
fate
of
the
22,000
people
who
were
stopped
on
the
high
seas
who
have
been
sent
back.
and
there
is
evidence
that
shows
that
they
were
sent
back
specifically
because
of
these
studies
and
the
alleged
results
of
these
interviews.
the
government
also
claims
in
the
reply
brief,
page
7,
that
they
are
afraid
the
authorities
will
get
the
names
of
these
returnees.
well,
they
already
have
the
names
of
the
22,000.
and
i
would
submit
that
for
all
the
reasons
already
shown
about
how
public
these
interviews
were,
that
it's
no
secret
who
these
people
were.
also,
the
government
talks
over
and
over
about
the
pledge
of
confidentiality,
the
promise
of
confidentiality.
again,
the
only
evidence
are
the
three
affidavits.
when
you
read
each
of
those
three
affidavits,
they
use
practically
the
same
language,
that
there
was
an
understanding
of
confidentiality.
what
was
that
understanding?
i
don't
know.
when
you
read
the
individual
reports
themselves,
nowhere
in
there
does
it
say
how
this
confidentiality
promise
came
about.
i
believe
it
was
the
washington
post
case
which
said...
versus
the
state
department
that
said
a
mere
promise
of
confidentiality
cannot
be
something
just
to
hide
information
behind.
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
these
reports
which
gives
any
indication
of
why
confidentiality
was
promised
or
that
anyone
specifically
asked
for
it.
there
may
have
been
one
person
that
asked
for
it.
i
don't
want--
mr.
michael
dean
ray
--which
decision
are
you
referring
to?
mr.
michael
dean
ray
no.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
eleventh
circuit
says
that
they
took
note
of
the
claim
that
the
government
had
promised
confidentiality.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
they
accepted
that.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
i
don't
believe
they
disbelieved
it,
but
they
felt
that
the...
they
stated
specifically
that
they
felt
that
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government's
conclusion
to
the
contrary
was
true
or
not
was
certainly
or
great
or
significant
public
interest,
and
that
the
release
of
the
names
and
other
identifying
matter
in
this
case
would
lead
to
the
truth
in
that
matter.
mr.
michael
dean
ray
i
don't
believe
they
ever
mention
that
anywhere
in
their
opinion.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
actual
reports
themselves,
you
can
see
that
very
readily,
practically
on
every
page.
i
guess
i've
pretty
well
said
everything,
and
i
would
just
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
below.
thank
you.
