justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
get
out
before
the
time
is
up?
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
about
whether
these
are
similar
files
within
the
meaning
of
exemption
6?
i
know
nobody
argues
it,
but
are
there
any
other
cases
in
which
files
that
are
not
indexed
or
maintained
by
the
agency,
by
the
identity
of
the
person
who
is
the
subject
of
the
file,
have
been
held
to
be
similar
files
by
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
that
they
asked
for
the
information
about
identified
people
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
isn't
immediately
apparent
to
me
that
this
fits
within
the
definition
of
the
statute,
that
i
just
thought
i
should
let
you
know
that
it's
probably--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
involved
files
that
were
maintained
under
the
names
of
the
person
named
in
the
request,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ray,
on
that
point,
isn't
that
apparent
from
the
text
of
the
documents
that
have
been
provided
to
you,
even
if
you
don't
know
the
names
of
the
people
who
were
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
make
two
assumptions,
one,
that
the
government
is
telling
the
truth,
and
secondly,
that
you
don't
really
have
an
opportunity
to
interview...
re-interview
these
people,
will
the
names
add
anything
at
all
to
your
knowledge
about
what
the
government
is
doing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
your
entire
purpose
is
to
verify
the
accuracy
of
the
information
and
to...
also
to
re-interview
to
find
out
if
they
would
have
had
a
different
result
if
they
had
conducted
additional
interviews?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
there
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
is
it
not
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
document
that
you've
examined
that
they
did
not
interview
anyone
in
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ray,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
the
point
you
are
making
about
the
haitian
police
and
the
haitian
executive
have
all
of
this
information.
you
say
they
have
all
these
names?
are
there
some
reports
that
indicate
they
were
present
during
interviews?
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
the
argument
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
would
you
comment
on
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
22,000
names
are
available
and
therefore,
unless
one
of
these
reports
described
mistreatment,
there
really
isn't
much
concern
about
the
identity
getting
back
to
the
haitian
government,
as
i
understand
it.
they
already
know
the
names
of
these
people
and
they
certainly
wouldn't
be
upset
if
somebody
was
interviewed
and
said
we
didn't
get
mistreated.
that's
what
i
guess
all
these
people
said.
is
there
an
interest
in
keeping
this
information
from
the
government
of
haiti?
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
of
course
know
who
those
people
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
concern
about
mistreatment
would
be
that
if
you
had
fled
the
country
and
tried
to
get
over
here,
you
might
be
disloyal,
and
so
forth,
to
haiti?
