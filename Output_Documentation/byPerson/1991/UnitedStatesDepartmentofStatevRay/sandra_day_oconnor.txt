justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ray,
i'm
concerned
about
whether
there
is
any
limiting
principle
in
the
eleventh
circuit's
holding
here.
it
reads
as
though
any
time
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
requested
information
might
lead
to
further
knowledge
about
government
affairs,
that
that's
enough.
what
do
you
think
the
limiting
principle
is
under
the
eleventh
circuit's
holding?
