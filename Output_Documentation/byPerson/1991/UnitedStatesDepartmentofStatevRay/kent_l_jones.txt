mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
under
exemption
6
of
the
act,
which
relates
to
private
information
and
government
records,
this
court
has
twice
concluded
that
it
is
unquestionably
appropriate
to
redact
private
names
from
government
documents
produced
under
the
act,
for
private
names
reveal
nothing
about
how
government
conducts
its
business.
in
this
case,
however,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
concluded
that
private
names
in
confidential
state
department
interviews
conducted
in
haiti
in
the
early
1980's
should
be
disclosed.
the
purpose
of
these
interviews
was
to
monitor
haitian
compliance
with
its
then
recent
undertaking
to
not
harass
or
mistreat
haitians
who
are
intercepted
on
the
ocean
seas
by
u.s.
vessels
and
return
to
haitian
ports.
after
they
were
returned,
certain
interviewees
were
randomly
approached
by
representatives
of
the
department
of
state
in
haiti.
they
were
assured
confidential
discussions,
and
based
upon
those
assurances,
frank
disclosure
of
the
personal
treatment
that
each
interviewee
received
by
the
haitian
government,
as
well
as
intimate
personal
information
and
descriptions
of
domestic
conditions
in
haiti,
were
obtained.
out
of
the
hundreds
of
interviews
that
were
conducted,
there
was
only
one
confirmed
case
where
a
haitian
who
had
been
returned
by
u.s.
vessels
had
been
mistreated
by
its
government.
when
respondents
sought
copies
of
these
documents
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
state
department
made
them
available.
but
in
accordance
with
the
practice
approved
by
this
court
in
rose
and
reporters
committee,
redacted
the
private
names
from
the
documents.
the
names
of
the
government
officers
who
conducted
the
interviews
are
revealed
on
the
documents
and
were
not
redacted.
the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
generalized
balancing
test
that
compared
the
public
interest
in
disclosure
with
the
private
interest
in
privacy.
the
court's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
are
applications
for
the
balancing
test
that
we
still
of
course
recognize.
we
think
that
there
is
nonetheless
a
workable
rule
that
congress
adopted
under
exemption
6
that
doesn't
require
an
ad
hoc
balancing
in
each
case.
the
legislative
history,
though,
the
senate
and
house
reports
under
exemption
6
made
clear
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
the
choice
would
simply
be
between
full
disclosure
and
nondisclosure.
the
senate
report
specifically
says
that
what
was
intended
was
what
was
described
as
responsible
disclosure.
and
the
report
gives
specific
content
to
that
term.
the
senate
report
indicates
that
in
balancing
the
public
and
private
interests,
what
is
to
be
accomplished
is
an
accommodation
of
the
two
interests
under
which,
and
i
quote,
"neither
is
abrogated
or
substantially
subordinated.
"
so
the
basic
thrust
of
exemption
6,
the
primary
inquiry,
is
how
do
you
protect
both
interests.
the
statutory
mechanism
that
congress
provided
for
this
is
the
last
sentence
of
section
552(b).
it
specifically
provides
that
exempt
information
can
be
redacted,
but
governmental
public
data
can
be
disclosed.
under
exemption
6,
we
submit
that
this
provision
is
not
simply
an
available
tool,
but
it
is
an
essential
feature
of
the
mutual
accommodation
of
public
and
private
interests
that
congress
intended.
it
allows
redaction
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
individuals,
but
it
allows
disclosure
to
present
government
facts
under
the
act.
in
fact,
the
house
report
at
page
11
specifically
contemplated
this
result
in
providing
that
individualized
identifying
information
should
not
be
disclosed
but
underlying
facts
and
compilations
of
statistical
information
should
be.
we
submit
this
is
the
workable
rule
that
congress
intended
under
the
statute.
now,
your
honor,
i...
in
describing
this
as
a
workable
rule,
it
may
be
simply
a
quibble,
but
i
do
want
to
suggest
that
i
see
a
distinction
in
the
court's
cases
between
workable
rules
and
what
this
court
has
described
as
categorical
rules.
a
workable
rule
is
one
that
the
court
construes
as
being
the
intended
result
that
congress
had
when
it
adopted
the
statute.
a
categorical
rule
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
situations
where
there
is
room
for
judgment
left
in...
for
the
court
to
make
an
empirical
judgment
about
whether
cases
will
ordinarily
or
most
frequently
properly
be
decided
under
the
statute
in
one
direction.
we
think
this
is
a
workable
rule
that
congress
intended.
there
is
ample
evidence
of
that
intent.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point,
but
as
i
understand
the
court's
decision,
for
example,
in
reporters
committee,
which
of
course
wasn't
a
redaction
case,
it
was
a
disclosure
case.
the
question
was
whether
the
document
should
be
produced.
so
there
wasn't
this...
the
workable
rule
that
we
proposed
wouldn't
have
worked.
but
when
the
court
adopted
a
categorical
rule
in
reporters
committee,
it
was
making
a
prudential
judgment
that
the
interests
that
congress
intended
to
protect
were
sufficiently
great
in
the
most
similar
cases,
so...
and
that
the
public
interest
in
disclosure
in
that
instance
was
sufficiently
low
that
as
a
categorical
rule,
all
rap
sheets
would
be
subject
to
nondisclosure.
now
that's
a
harder
case
than
we
have
because
we're
not
talking
about
nondisclosure.
we
had
disclosed
these
reports.
what
we're
talking
about
is
simply
the
identifying
information.
and
in
the
context
of
identifying
information,
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
that
what
was
intended
to
be
allowed
was
production
of
facts,
protection
of
individual
identities.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
our
understanding
of
the
workable
rule
that
we
think
congress
intended
is
also
elaborated
by
the
fact
that
in
the
house
report
at
page
6,
there
are
only
two
examples
given
of
when
names
would
be
disclosed.
those
two
examples
are
government
employees
and
their
duty
stations,
and
government
officers
voting
on
official
orders.
in
those
situations,
the
names
of
the
individuals
directly
show
how
government
conducts
its
business.
by
parallel
reasoning,
the
name
of
a
person
who
is
doing
the
government's
business
would
also
show
that.
a
government
contractor,
a
person
operating
under
a
government
grant...
these
are
people
who
are
doing
the
government's
business
even
though
they
are
still
private.
and
we
think
that
in
those
instances
there
would
be
a
public
interest
in
disclosure
of
the
names.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
am
not
aware
of
what
you
might
have
in
mind.
of
course,
in
responding
to
specific
arguments,
we
may
have
highlighted
different
issues.
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
aware
of
an
inconsistency,
your
honor.
respondents
seem
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
such
a
general
rule.
they
concede
that
congress
intended
that
the
redaction
of
private
names
would
occur
in
what
they
describe
as
the
majority
of
cases,
at
page
27
of
their
brief.
they
suggest,
however,
that
there
is
some
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
redaction
that
should
apply
here.
they
claim
that
the
case
is
outside
the
normal
rule,
solely
because
they
can
use
the
names
of
these
individuals
to
track
them
down
in
haiti,
reinterview
them,
and
based
upon
those
additional
interviews,
determine
or
form
a
judgment
about
whether
the
government's
initial
interview
reports
are
truthful
and
accurate.
and
based
upon
this
sole
justification,
they
believe
disclosure
is
required.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
in
this
case
for
any
assertion
that
the
government's
interview
reports
are
not
truthful
or
accurate.
they
are...
as
the
court
can
determine
by
inspecting
them,
simply
recite
conversations
that
occurred
in
confidence
in
haiti.
the
names
are
the
only
thing
that
have
been
redacted
from
them.
they
describe
details
that
flow
from
conversations.
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
interpretative
remarks,
not
to
say
there
is
none.
but
there
is
no
basis
for
a
suggestion
that
these
documents
are
not
truthful.
notwithstanding
the
lack
of
a
basis,
respondents
claim
disclosure
should
occur
so
they
could
find
out.
well,
there
is
no
limit
to
that
sort
of
unworkable
proposition.
the
names
in
veterans'
hospital
records,
government
employee
records,
cadet
disciplinary
reports
as
in
rose,
rap
sheets
as
in
reporters
committee...
all
contain
names
of
individuals
that
theoretically
one
could
go
to
to
inquire...
to
find
out
if
the
government's
records
are
truthful
or
accurate.
this
is
a
sweeping
interference.
it
is
truly
an
exception
that
would
swallow
the
rule.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
in
that
regard
that
the
rule
that
we're...
that
we
do
think
exists
here
would
be
swallowed
by
a
contention
that
in
every
case
we
can
find
out
if
it's
truthful.
because
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
not
simply
to
reach
a
result,
but
it's
to
reach
a
workable
result
in
a
manner
that
congress
intended
without
ad
hoc
balancing
in
every
instance.
this
court
has
noted
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
by
congress
that
they
desired
to
avoid
ad
hoc
balancing
and
desired
to
conduct
the
foia
under
workable
rules.
since
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
in
this
case,
the
second
and
the
third
circuits
have
already
had
occasion
to
consider
this
exact
proposition.
in
the
hopkins
case,
the
second
circuit
rejected
the
respondent's
claim
as
too
attenuated
to
be
a
basis
for
ad
hoc
balancing.
the
third
circuit
agreed
with
the
hopkins
decision
in
flra
v.
the
navy.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
the
disclosure...
by
comparison
the
foia...
litigation
generally,
this
is
an
exceptionally
unusual
type
of
disclosure
because
it
involves,
as
you
would
look
at
the
interview
reports,
it
involves
details
about
their
personal
lives,
their
living
conditions,
their
poverty,
their
ambitions
to
leave
their
country,
their
frustrations
with
their
present
living
situation.
this
is
exceptionally
sensitive,
personal
information.
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
decisions
have
considered
the
privacy
interests
to
be
sufficient
simply
when
it
would
cause
a
commercial
solicitation.
this...
there...
i
can't
think
of
an
analogous
instance
that
would
come
close
to
this
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
privacy
involved.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir.
well,
i
think
that
you
can
look...
as
congressman
fascell
said,
you
look
to
the
character
of
the
information.
the
character
of
this
information
is
inherently,
demonstrably
private.
it's
also,
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
note
this,
it's
quite
politically
charged.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the...
i
believe
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
just
to
put
this
in
context,
foia
requires
disclosure
of
documents,
not
lists.
so
presumably
they
would
have
to
ask
us
for
documents
that
contain
such
names.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
our...
and
i
offer
that
as
a
preface
because
in
that
context,
the
name
then
has
a
location,
has
a
context.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not
at
all.
no,
sir,
i
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that
may
be
their
desire,
but
exemption
6
was
cleary
intended
to
work
just
the
opposite
result.
again,
the
house
report
states
quite
clearly
that
what
we're
supposed
to
do
is
produce
the
underlying
facts,
produce
compilations
of
information,
but
we're
not
supposed
to
disclose
identifying
personal
information.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
personal
information.
it
is
his
name
and
it
puts
it
in
a
context.
he
was
interviewed
upon
return
from
haiti.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
particularly
in
this
context.
i
think
it
would
be
in
most
contexts
if
not
all,
but
particularly
here
where
the
nature
of
the
interview
was
a
person
was
asked
voluntarily
to
cooperate
in
confidence
on
haitian
soil
in
providing
information
to
u.s.
agents
about
haitian
governmental
action,
as
well
as
domestic
conditions
generally
in
haiti.
indeed,
it's
hard
for...
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
person
that
could
come
before
this
court
with
a
greater
claim
to
privacy
than
a
foreign
national
who
cooperated
voluntarily
and
in
confidence
with
our
state
department
officers
in
providing
sensitive
political
information
as
well
as
private,
personal
information
about
the
government
of
the
foreign
country.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
passports
as
the...
i
mean,
the
similar
files
case
was
the
washington
post
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
okay.
well,
the
general...
to
answer
your
question
directly,
i
think
washington
post
makes
it
quite
clear
that
these
are
similar
files.
they
do
contain
personal
information
that...
i've
detailed
it
at
length...
that
would
qualify
under
the
standard
of
washington
post.
it
hasn't
been
addressed
below.
no...
neither
the
district
court
nor
court
of
appeals
addressed
it,
and
i
don't
believe
it's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--your
honor,
i
think
it
is
only
immediately
apparent
after
reading
the
washington
post
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct,
but
the
standard
that
the
court
drew
on
was
from
the
house
and
senate
reports
which
describe
generally
documents
that
contain
personal
identifying
information.
so
we
are
well
within
the
legislative
standard
and
certainly
within
the
washington
post
decision
on
that
particular
issue.
i
do
want
to
mention
that
there
are
two
other
provisions
of
the
statute
that
reinforce
the
conclusion
that
this
court
expressed
in
reporters
committee
that
private
names
need
not
be
disclosed.
section
552(a)(2)
of
the
act
provides
that
names
may
be
redacted
from
published
orders
if
the
disclosure
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy.
thus,
the
standard
for
redaction
in
that
setting
is
identical
to
the
standard
under
exemption
6.
the
house
report
at
page
8
explains
that
private
names
are
properly
redacted
in...
under
552(a)(2)
where
they,
quote,
"have
no
bearing
or
effect
on
the
general
public.
"
private
names
inherently
have
no
bearing
or
effect
on
the
general
public,
especially
randomly
selected
haitians
who
were
interviewed
by
the
state
department
have
no
inherent
bearing
or
effect
on
the
public.
section
552(a)(3)
also
emphasizes
that
the
focus
of
foia
is
on
the
interests
of
the
general
public
because
it
provides
for
disclosure
to
be
made
to
any
person.
now
the
court
has
interpreted
that
language
to...
frequently
to
conclude
that
the
individual
purposes
of
requesters
are
not
to
be
given
weight
in
deciding
whether
disclosure
is
warranted.
the
original
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
move
away
from
the
preexisting
standard
of
apa
section
3,
which
had
provided
for
disclosure
based
upon
the
individual
needs
of
the
requester.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
follow
your
question,
but
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
believe
so,
but
even
if
that
were
correct,
it
wouldn't
have
implications
for
this
case.
i
don't
believe
that's
correct
because
congressman
fascell,
as
we
mentioned,
says
that
under
foia,
what's
relevant
is
the
character
of
the
information.
and
this
court
under
552(a)(3)
has
often
said
that
the
particular
purposes,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
the
intended
uses
of
an
individual
requester,
are
not
entitled
to
weight
in
determining
whether
disclosure
is
warranted
under
the
act.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
justice
scalia,
the
stage
of
the
discussion
that
you're
addressing
isn't
reached
in
this
case
because
this
is
a
redaction
case.
what
you
are
describing
is
the
situation
where
the
redaction
doesn't
solve
the
problem;
it
doesn't
provide
a
workable
rule
because,
as
in
reporters
committee,
redaction
would
not
protect
privacy
because
they
sought
specific
records.
and
in
that
situation,
you
do
have
little
choice
but
to
either
apply
an
ad
hoc
balancing
or
a
categorical
rule
based
upon
general
likelihoods
of
the
balancing
of
the
interests.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
disclosure
problem
because
we
have
a
redaction
case,
just
like
rose
was,
and
precisely
of
the
type
that
congress
understood
would
exist
in
which
the
intended
result
is
you
redact
the
private
information.
you
disclose
everything
else;
you
don't
have
to
do
an
ad
hoc
balancing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
congress
anticipated
an
accommodation
under
which
neither
interest
is
abrogated
or
substantially
subordinated,
that
is
implemented
at
the
first
stage
by
protection
of
the
private
information,
as
the
court
did
in
rose.
if
privacy...
if
there's
not
a
possibility
of
a
mutual
accommodation
because
of
the
nature
of
the
request,
as
when
you
ask
for
the
personal...
when
you
ask
for
the
records
about
a
named
individual,
then
it's
necessary
to
go
into
the
balancing
problem
that
you've
been
describing.
the...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
i
knew
exactly
how
to
help
you,
i
certainly
would,
but--
[laughter]
this
court
has
often
stated
that
great
nations
should
keep
their
words.
we
think
this
is
such
a
case.
the
statutory
method
for
accommodating
the
competing
and
equally
important
public
and
private
interests
is
redaction
of
the
private
names,
disclosure
of
the
public
information.
we
think
the
state
department
properly
accommodated
those
interests.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
just
one
item.
there
is
a
suggestion
by
respondents
that
there
is
only
a
minimal
privacy
interest
involved
here,
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
privacy
interest
at
issue
here
to
be
quite
significant,
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
apparently
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
did
not
think
it
was
significant
enough
here.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
separate
and
apart
from
the
personal
interest
in
the
privacy
associated
with
the
intimate
detail,
is
there
an
interest
in
protecting
this
information
from
the
haitians?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
keeping
the
information
from
the
public
including
the
haitian
government?
yes,
there
is.
there
are
two
parts
to
your
question.
what
is
this
22,000
and
500?
twenty-two
thousand
is
simply
everybody
that's
been
returned.
that
doesn't
tell
anything.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
certainly
do,
just
as
we
would
now
who's
returned
on
our
shores.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
purpose
of
the
interviews
was
simply
to
find
out
whether
they
were
being
mistreated.
and
the
reason
we
wanted
to
find
out
was
because
we
have
an
undertaking
under
united
nations'
protocols
to
allow
refugee
status
to
people
who,
if
returned,
would
be
mistreated.
so
that
was
the
basis
for
our
inquiry.
the
haitian
government
would
have
no
basis
for
knowing
who
we
spoke
to.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
concluded
that
the
information
was
held
confidential
by
the
state
department.
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
was
one
reported,
confirmed
instance
of
mistreatment.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
your
honor,
in
addition
to
the
private
nature
of
the
information,
which
exists
with
respect
to
all
500,
we
also
believe
that
with
respect
to
all
500
there
is
an
undeniable
wisdom
in
the
caution
that
he
state
department
exercises
in
conducting
these
interviews
in
a
confidential
matter,
because
we
cannot
guarantee
the
safety
or
assure
that
a
composition
of
future
governments
in
haiti
or
in
other
countries.
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
would
say
that
there
are
two
courts
below
that
have
found
to
the
contrary.
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
we've
supplied,
in
addition
to
the
three
affidavits,
which
of
course
are
rather
substantial
evidence.
there
is
additional
evidence
which
supports
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that
is...
it
is
a
prudential
consideration
of
the
department
that
to
obtain
cooperation
in
foreign
affairs,
we
need
to
be
able
to
have
reliable
assurances
of
confidentiality.
but
what
i'm
talking
about
also
is
the
fact
that
we
can't
protect
these
people,
we
can't
predict
what
future
governments'
reactions
may
be
about
their
voluntary
cooperation
with
the
united
states.
in
the
1974
amendment
in
the
conference
committee
report
on
the
1974
amendments...
to
foia,
the
committee
talks
about
the
unique
insight
that
the
state
department
has
in
matters
respecting
confidentiality
in
matters
concerning
foreign
affairs.
this
is
a
unique
insight
based
upon,
i
suppose,
centuries
of
concern
about
the
need
to
protect
confidentiality
in
foreign
interviews
conducted
on
foreign
soil.
we
think
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
privacy
component,
but
notwithstanding
that,
there
is
the
inherent
private
nature
of
the
details
of
the
individuals'
lives,
which
is
itself
sufficient
under
foia
litigation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
