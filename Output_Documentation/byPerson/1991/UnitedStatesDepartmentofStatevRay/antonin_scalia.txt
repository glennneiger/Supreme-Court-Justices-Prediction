mr.
jones,
what
is
the
invasion
of
privacy
here
that
is
unwarranted,
caused
by
the
disclosure?
the
disclosure
would
show
nothing
more
than
that
these
people
were
interviewed
by
government
agents.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
was
interested
in
finding
out
is
whether
you
were
indeed
deciding
that
it
was
a
substantial
invasion
of
privacy
upon
the
basis
of
something
that
it
will
cause,
such
as
a
commercial
solicitation.
you're
not
relying
on
that
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
had
asked
for
the
names
of
the
people
first?
instead
of
asking
for
the
documents
they
just
asked,
we
would
like
the
names
of
the
people
who
were
interviewed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
this
happened
in
the
reverse
way.
you
redacted
the
names
and
gave
them
everything
that
the
people
had
said.
what
if
they
had
just
said,
we
don't
care
what
they
said.
we
just
want
to
know
their
names
because
we
want
to
go
talk
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
up
to
you
whether
you
choose
to
redact
the
name
or
redact
the
contents,
right?
i
mean,
you
could
redact
either
one,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
said,
we
want
those
documents
and
what
we
are
interested
in
is
the
names
of
the
people.
so
if
we
redact
anything,
don't
redact
the
names;
redact
all
of
the
personal
information.
we
don't
care
what
information
they
gave
you;
we
just
want
the
names.
that's
what
we're
interested
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
are
not
identifying...
producing
identifying
personal
information
if
you
give
none
of
these
personal
details;
all
you
give
is
the
name
of
the
person.
this
was
a
person
who
was
interviewed.
is
that
personal
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
would
be
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy,
to
say
that
so-and-so
was
interviewed
by
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
do
use
the
individual
needs
for
determining
whether
there's
a
public
interest,
i
presume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you
can
decide
whether
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
unwarranted
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
sufficient
public
interest
in
the
disclosure
without
inquiring
into
what
use
would
be
made
of
the
information.
that
does
require...
public
interest
inquiry
requires
you
to
advert
to
the
usefulness
of
the
information,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
character
of
the
information...
it's
important
information
or
unimportant
information
on
the
basis
of
what...
you
know,
whether
it
can
cause
the
public
to
do
something
that
it
would
not
otherwise
do.
it's
information
about,
you
know,
misdoings
within
the
government,
which
would
lead
to
congressional
investigations
or
lead
to
correction
of
those
misdoings.
i
don't
know
how
you
run
a
public
interest
analysis
of
the
information
without
focusing
on
how
useful
is
the
information,
what
can
it
be
used
for
by
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
that
i
don't
see
the
distinction
you're
drawing
between
redaction
and
refusal
to
disclose
the
document
in
its
entirety.
you
are
saying
there's
a
different
test
for
whether
you
can
refuse
to
turn
over
the
whole
document
than
there
is
for
refusing
to
turn
over
portions
of
the
document?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
is
the
census
data
used
daily
in
all
sorts
of
contexts
by
congress,
by
the
executive
branch,
and
so
forth.
and
i
suppose
you
could
run
the
same
argument,
that
you
are
entitled
to
double-check
that
the
government
employees
who
collect
all
this
census
data
were
doing
it
correctly
because
this
is
enormously
important
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
for
that
particular
purpose,
but
for
other
purposes
that
are
just
as
important,
such
as
deciding
where
government
funds
will
be
allocated,
where
more
poor
people
are
located,
where...
you
know,
all
sorts
of
important
matters.
how
do
you
distinguish
the
census
material?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
you
would
be
able
to
get
the
tense
of
the
census
material,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
important
that
you
be
able
to
double-check
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
double-check...
the
public
has
the
right
to
double-check
the
work
that
the
government
has
done
in
assembling
any
information
that
is
important
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ray,
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
the
criterion
for
withholding
an
entire
document
is
different
from
the
criterion
for
withholding
a
portion
of
it,
for
redacting?
that
there's
a
different
test
for
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
that
there
hadn't
been
any
commitment
on
confidentiality?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
court
below...
eleventh
circuit,
i'm
sorry...
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
that
there
had
not
been
a
pledge
of
confidentiality?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
accepted
that
as
being
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
are
going
to
go
back
and
review
whether
there
was
or
wasn't.
we
are
probably
going
to
decide
on
the
basis
that
they
did.
did
they
disbelieve
the
government's
assertions
about
the
possibility
of
these
individuals
being
persecuted
by
haiti?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
disbelieve
that
the
interviews
were
at
least
private?
i
mean,
did
they
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
interviews
had
been
conducted
in
the
open,
as
you
say
they
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
only
gave
the
names
of
those
who
provided...
all
of
the
reports
show
that
they
weren't
mistreated?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
could
withhold
that
name,
i
guess,
and
provide
the
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
say
about
the
allegation
that
the
interviews
were
not
conducted
in
a
confidential
manner?
