were
there...
aren't
there
situations
such
as
the
names
or
donors
or
participants
from
governmental
contracts
that
might
well
be
revealed
to
the
benefit
of
the
country?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
give
me
some
assurance.
do
i
detect
a
shift
in
the
government's
position
between
their
first
brief
and
their
reply
brief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
they
are
entirely
consistent?

you
think
judge

correctly
applied
the
balancing
test
in
this
case?
justice

i'll
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
jones.

you
think
the
government
has
shifted
its
position
at
all
between
its
original
brief
and
its
reply
brief?
