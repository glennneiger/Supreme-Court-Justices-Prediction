9747,
united
states
department
of
state
v.
michael
b.
ray.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
view
is
that
what
you
describe
as
a
categorical
view...
rule
is
not
a
workable
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
ray,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ray,
if
you
could
make
the
same
argument
you're
making
about
the
government's
preparation
of
affidavits
for
search
warrants,
that
you
want
to
go
around
and
make
sure
the
government
is
truthfully
quoting
these
people
who
are
supplying
probable
cause.
perhaps
that's
all
perfectly
consistent
what
you
are
saying.
but
it
would
be
quite
an
expansion
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
don't
think
it's
been
used
for
that
purpose
before,
anymore
than
it's
been
used
for
the
purpose
that
you
are
now
trying
to
use
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ray.
mr.
jones,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
of
them
is
united
states
department
of
state
versus
michael
d.
ray.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
respondent's
freedom
of
information
act
request
for
state
department
documents
containing
information
about
haitian
nationals.
these
nationals
had
attempted
to
immigrate
illegally
to
the
united
states
and
were
involuntary
returned
to
haiti.
respondents
particularly
sought
to
obtain
reports
of
interviews
in
which
officials
from
the
united
states
embassy
in
haiti
inquired
whether
the
immigrants
had
been
harassed
or
prosecuted
by
the
haitian
government
after
they
were
involuntarily
returned
to
that
country.
in
response
to
this
request,
the
state
department
produced
25
documents
but
not
before
deleting
the
names
and
identifying
information
about
individual
returnees.
the
question
presented
to
us
is
whether
these
deletions
were
authorized
by
freedom
of
information
act's
exemption
6
which
provides
that
the
act's
disclosure
requirements
do
not
apply
to
personal
and
medical
files
and
similar
files
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens,
we
hold
that
the
deletions
were
authorized
because
the
disclosure
of
the
unreducted
interview
reports
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
the
haitian
returnees'
privacy.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
scalia
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
