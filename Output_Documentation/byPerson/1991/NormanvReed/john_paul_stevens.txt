justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
testimony
before
the
election
board.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincham,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
there
are
really
two
different
issues,
as
i
understand,
well,
putting
aside
the
name
problem
for
a
minute,
just
the
50,000
vote
requirement.
the
50,000
vote
requirement
applies
to
the
commissioners
who
are
elected
from
the
suburbs
and
to
the
officers
like
state's
attorney
who
ran
county
wide.
they
had
to
have
50.
but
you
also
challenge,
as
i
understand...
under
the
illinois
supreme
court's
holding...
under
the
illinois
supreme--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
the
effect
of
the
illinois
supreme
court's
decision,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
disqualify
the
entire
ballot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
those
running
for
like
state's
attorney
had
more
than
25,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they,
in
effect,
require
50,000
for
those
offices.
and
i
understand
your
position
on
those
officers
and
on
the
county
commissioners
running
from
the
suburbs...
rather
from
the
city...
from
the
city.
but
now
with
respect
to
the
county
commissioners
running
from
the
county
only,
the
suburban
area,
they
did
not
get
25,000
signatures
from
the
suburbs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
nevertheless
contend
they
are
entitled
to
be
on
the
ballot,
too.
this
is
a
point
in
which
you
differ
with
the
election
board.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
think
you've
explained
why
the
socialist
party
case
supports
you
with
respect
to
those
candidates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
shouldn't
be
involved
in
interpreting
the
illinois
statue.
is
there
any
federal
constitutional
requirement
that
would
prohibit
the
state
of
illinois
from
saying
that
if
you
want
to
run
from
the
suburbs
of
cook
county
for
a
position
on
the
county
board
representing
the
suburbs
only,
that
you
must
get
25,000
signatures
from
the
suburbs?
what
in
the
federal
constitution
prohibits
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
did
originally.
i
said
i
understand
your
position
on
the
county-wide
officers
and
on
the
commissioner
residents
of
chicago
who
are
elected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
for
further
enlightenment
only
with
respect
to
your
argument
pertaining
to
the
county
commissioners
elected
from
the
suburbs.
i
think
that's
the
point
in
which
you
differ
with
the
election
board.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
if
they
got
26,000
in
chicago
they
wouldn't
need
any
signatures
in
the
suburbs
to
run
a
slate
in
the
suburbs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
true
also
that
in
this
case,
the
petitions,
at
least
the
ones
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix,
for
the
19
candidates,
were
the
19
that
were
elected
either
from
chicago
or
county
wide.
and
the
seven
others,
who
were
just
from
the
suburbs,
were
on
an
entirely
different
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
wasn't
any
danger
of
the
kind
of
confusion.
mr.
gillis,
do
i
take
it
you
are
not
here
supporting
the
decision
of
the
cook
county
electoral
board
across
the
board,
so
to
speak?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point,
is
that
the
petition
at
page
4
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
only
names
on
that
are
the
19
candidates
who
either
ran
from
the
city
or
ran
county
wide.
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--maybe
that's
right.
but
just...
because
i'm
really
a
little
puzzled
by
it.
the
first
of
the
two
petitions
is
the
one
that
has
the
candidates
who
did
get
the
25,000
signatures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
is
the
group
that
go
the
7,800
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
were
they
two
separate
petitions,
or
are
they
two
parts
of
the
same
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
so
that
you're
saying
the
failure
to
qualify
in
the
one
part
should
disqualify
the
part--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
make
the
argument
if
they'd
simply
omitted
the
second
part?
if
they
had
confined
their
petition
to
page
1
and
left
page
2
out
entirely,
then
you
would
have
no
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
all
offices
to
be
filled
throughout
the
state
or
throughout
the
area
from...
throughout
the
area
that
you're
petitioning
from?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
particular
context
on
page
1
was
county
wide
and
commissioners
from
chicago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
also
included
running
for
governor,
possibly,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
pursue
that
just
a
little
step.
there
are
seven
or
eight
offices...
i
can't
remember...
state's
attorney
of
cook
county,
assessor
of
cook
county,
clerk
of
cook
county,
sheriff
of
the
county,
treasurer
of
cook
county,
superintendent
of
eduction,
and
so
forth.
supposing
a
party
wanted
to
run
for
six
of
those,
but
not
all
seven
or
eight,
whatever
it
is.
the
law
would
not
permit
them
to
qualify
as
a
party
unless
they
got
25,000...
and
what
is
the
state
interest
in
requiring
all
eight
instead
of
just
six
or
seven?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
that
apply
equally
to
the
republicans
or
the
democrats
who
might
decide
they
haven't
got
a
chance
of
electing
the
clerk
of
cook
county
for
some
reason...
maybe
the
incumbent
is
so
terribly
popular
that
they
don't
have
to
run
a
candidate.
what
is
the
state
interest
that
justifies
the
disparate
treatment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
the
state
interest
in
making
them
run
somebody
that
they
know
is
going
to
lose,
and
they
aren't
going
to
spend
any
money
trying
to
elect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
really
mean
that
because
on
the
position
for
state's
attorney
or
county
clerk,
for
example,
you
would
accept
25,000
signatures
all
from
hyde
park
or
one
tiny
area
in
chicago
that
would
qualify
them
to
run
for
state's
attorney,
if
they
filed
the
right
form.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
they
ran
a
full
slate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
people
running
for
the
offices
i'm
describing,
all
of
the
signatures
came
from
a
tiny
area
within
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
petitions
would
still
be
good.
assuming--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
a
candidate
for
a
county-wide
office
does
not
have
to
have
any
support
at
all
outside
the
city
of
chicago
to
get
on
the
ballot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
long
as
the
slate
is...
you
know,
a
complete
slate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
evans...
even
if
alderman
evans
had
come
in,
he
would
have
been
a
new
party
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
distinction
isn't
between
the
evans
harold
washington
party
and
the
pincham
harold
washington
party.
it's
the
distinction
between
the
chicago
harold
washington
party
and
anything
else.
