justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
i
take
it
your
principal
argument
is
that
the
each
component
portion
of
the
statute
is
invalid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
is
that
one
of
your
principal
contentions
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
what's
your
best
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
in
your
case
the
requirement
was
for
a
total
of
25,000
signatures,
roughly
apportioned
between
the
suburban
and
the
city
area,
so
you
could
have,
say
40,
percent
of
your
signatures
from
the
suburban
area
and
60
percent
of
the
city.
what
result
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
so
even
if
the
signature
requirement
were
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
registered
voters
in
each
of
the
districts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
the
rationale
for
your
argument
so
that
if
we
do
decide
to
write
an
opinion
we
can.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
would...
you
were
reading
from
your
argument,
not
your
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
part
of
the
confusion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would
be
your
position
on
a
state
law
which
required
a
complete
slate
within
say,
just
the
city
of
chicago?
say
they
required...
say
they
had
25,000
signatures,
but
they
were
required
to
run
a
complete
slate
of
officers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
because
it's
not
indicative
of
the
existence
of
a
viable
party
that
it
can
field
candidates
for
all
of
the
ballot
positions?
