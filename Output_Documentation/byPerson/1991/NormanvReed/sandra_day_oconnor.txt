justice

day
o'connor
mr.
gillis,
is
the
question
concerning
that
rule
one
of
the
ones
included
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
25,000
signatures
have
been
the
required
number
in
the
suburban
area
for
suburban
candidates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gillis,
you
know,
i
simply
can't
find
in
the
questions
presented,
in
either
petition,
a
question
on
the
whole
slate
question.
am
i
overlooking
one
of
the
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
illinois
supreme
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
guess
what
we're
looking
at
here,
as
far
as
i
know,
are
the
questions
presented
in
these
blue
petitions.
and
i
simply
fail
to
see
a
question
presenting
that
complete
slate
requirement.
am
i
missing
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
question
do
you
say
covers
it?
