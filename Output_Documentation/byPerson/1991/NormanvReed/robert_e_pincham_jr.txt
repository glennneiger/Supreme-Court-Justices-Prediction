mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
democratic
party,
partisan
politics,
continues
to
permeate
the
illinois
judiciary
up
to
and
including
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
october
12,
1990,
order
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
completely
disregarded
this
court's
precedent
in
illinois
state
board
of
elections
v.
socialist
workers
party
and
moore
v.
ogilvie.
more
importantly,
not
only
did
it
disregard
the
precedent
previously
set
by
this
court,
but
it
was
a
flagrant
and
blatant
attempt
to
limit
political
opposition
to
the
existing
democratic
party
machine.
i
hasten
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
harold
washington
party
is
now
the
second
largest
political
party
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
of
the
municipality
of
chicago.
it
regularly
out-polls
the
republican
party,
for
example,
and
today
offers
the
only
viable
alternative
to
the
democratic
party
in
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
indeed
it
is,
your
honor.
i
hasten
to
point
out
to
your
honor
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
promulgated
no
statute
or
regulation
controlling
the
expansion
of
an
established
political
party
from
one
jurisdiction
or
one
subdivision
of
the
state
into
the
next.
the
striking
of
the
entire
harold
washington
party
from
the
ballot
was
a
judicially
contrived
remedy
by
the
four
democratic
party
justices
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
indeed,
contradicted
the
rule
of
law
as
previously
set
forth
by
that
court
in
anderson
v.
schneider.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
the
record
is--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--actually
it
went
further
than
that,
your
honor.
the
leader
of
the
city
harold
washington
party
and
the
founder
of
that
party
appeared
before
the
county
officers
electoral
board,
and
went
even
further
and
said
not
only
is
it
the
same
party,
i
give
my
permission
to
expand
this
party
outside
of
the
municipality
of
chicago
and
into
suburban
cook
county.
the
record
is
clear
on
that
point.
moreover,
and
i
hasten
to
point
out
to
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
competing
group
here
saying
no,
this
isn't
the
harold
washington
party,
we
are.
there
is
but
one
harold
washington
party,
and
references
to
the
contrary
by
opposing
counsel
are
simply
misrepresentations
of
the
fact.
there
is
but
one
harold
washington
party,
and
it
now
seeks
to
expand
beyond
the
city
limits
of
chicago
and
into
cook
county.
the
question
then
becomes--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
yes,
indeed
it
was.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
timothy
evans
and
from
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
to
the
cook
county
officers
electoral
board.
and
they,
in
fact,
so
found
in
their
opinion.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
before
the
cook
county
officers
election
board,
that
is
correct.
that
testimony
was
given.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
where
in
the
record
before
you?
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
certainly,
i'd
be
more
than
happy
to,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
frankly,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
reason's
we're
here.
they
said
nothing.
they
simply
entered
an
order
striking
the
harold
washington
party
from
the
ballot,
and
in
that
order
stated
that
they
would
write
an
opinion
in
the
near
future.
that
opinion
has
never
been
written.
we
don't
know
why
that
opinion
was
never
written.
i
point
out
to
your
honor--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--we
know
the
reasons
that
the
dissenters
gave
for
disagreeing,
but
the
opinion
analyzing
the
reasons
for
striking
the
harold
washington
party
were
not
fully
set
forth
in
an
opinion.
what
the...
four
democratic
party
judges
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
effect
ruled
is
that,
contrary
to
the
prior
precedent
of
this
court,
this
political
party
much
have,
not
25,000
petition
signatures,
but
50,000
signatures,
and
that
those
50,000
signatures
must
be
divided
geographically
25,000
from
the
city
of
chicago,
and
25,000
from
suburban
cook
county
outside
the
city
of
chicago.
i
point
out
to
your
honor
that
the
total
number
of
signatures
required
statewide
for
the
entire
state
of
illinois
is
only
25,000
signatures.
thus,
the
ruling
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
not
only
require
twice
the
number
of
signatures,
but
would
require
those
signatures
be
obtained
from
a
smaller
portion
of
the
state
than,
of
course,
the
entire
state
itself.
so
in
ruling
that--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--i
think
that
the...
to
be
perfectly
candid
and
frank
with
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
opinion
would
have
been
an
embarrassment
to
the
justices
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
did
not
change
between
the
date
that
justice
stevens
issued
the
initial
stay
or
the
date
upon
which
the
full
court
issued
the
stay
and
december
6.
the
court
had
2
months
within
which
to
write
that
opinion.
and
of
course,
that
opinion
was
not
written.
moreover,
had
the
court
acted
in
good
faith,
or
intended
to
act
in
good
faith,
it
could
have
asked
this
court,
for
example,
to
stay
its
proceedings
and
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
write
its
opinion
so
that
this
court
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
analysis
of
the
four
democratic
party
justices
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
but
that,
too,
was
not
done.
more
importantly,
or
perhaps
equally
importantly,
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
distinguish
its
own
prior
opinion
in
anderson
v.
schneider.
we
are,
of
course,
sensitive
to
the
precarious
and
perhaps
irreconcilable
dilemma
of
co-petitioner
cook
county
officers
electoral
board.
they
find
themselves
in
the
untenable
position
of
trying
to
reconcile
self-contradictory
language
of
the
statute.
first,
the
statute
provides
that
the
entire
petition
shall
contain
not
more
than
25,000
signatures
as
the
minimum
requirement.
elsewhere,
in
the
same
section
of
the
statute,
section
10-2,
it
provides
that
each
component
of
the
petition
shall
provide
25,000--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--well,
as
the
three
republican
justices
of
the
court
pointed
out,
that
need
not
be
reached.
however,
and
i
also
point
out
to
this--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--that
it
is
invalid?
absolutely.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
it
is
invalid
because
this
court
said
in
the
socialist
workers
party
case
and
in
moore
v.
ogilvie,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
require
a
third
political
party
to
obtain
more
signatures
on
its
petition,
nominating
petition
ballots,
than
are
required
for
an
entire
state.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that,
too,
would
be
unconstitutional--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--under
this
court's
ruling
in
moore
v.
ogilvie,
because
then
you
would
in
effect
give
veto
power
to
suburban
voters
as
the
harold
washington
party
expands
from
the
city.
where
the
harold
washington
party
is
strongest--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--no.
that,
perhaps
would
correct
that
constitutional
infirmity.
but
i
hasten
to
point
to
your
honor,
the
statute
does
not
say
that.
the
legislature--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--i
base
my
argument
and
the
rationale
of
my
argument
on
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
moore
v.
ogilvie
and
socialist
workers
party,
along
with
the
rationale
employed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
anderson
v.
schneider,
where,
in
that
case,
the
court
ruled
that
even
if
the
party
failed
to
file
a
full
slate,
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
remedy
is
not
to
exclude
the
entire
party
from
the
ballot.
and
that
is
the
rationale
that
i
urge
upon
this
court
at
this
time.
we
further
point
to
this
court
that
in
ruling
on
the
objections,
the
cook
county
officers
electoral
board
considered
the
fact
that
the
objections
themselves
were
not
properly
obtained.
while
the
cook
county
officers
electoral
board
ruled
that
they
did
not
consider
the
manner
in
which
they
were
obtained
to
be
fraudulent,
it
is
clear
that
false
affidavits
were
submitted
to
the
county
officers
electoral
board
with
those
objections
through
the
nominating
petition
of
the
harold
washington
party.
generally,
such
false
affidavits
submitted
to
a
tribunal
will
result
in
the
objections
for
other
document
being
stricken
in
its
entirety.
that
was
not
done
here.
had
that
been
done,
of
course,
we
would
not
have
the
problem
that
we're
faced
with
today.
in
reviewing
the
statute,
i
would
point
out
to
justice
kennedy
that
the
burden
of
analyzing
the
statute
has
been
removed
from
this
court.
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
state
of
illinois,
has
interpreted
that
state
statute
in
a
manner
that
is
repugnant
to
the
constitution
as
previously
set
forth
by
this
court's
rulings
in
anderson...
i'm
sorry,
in
socialist
workers
party
and
moore
v.
ogilvie.
so
as
we
stand
here
today,
your
honor,
we
urge
upon
this
court
to
enforce
its
own
prior
decision
over
the
illinois
supreme
court,
which
did
not
deem
fit
to
bless
us
with
its
opinion
before
the
justices
changed,
nor
have
they
taken
any
effort
subsequent
to
that
change
to
rehear
the
case
and
to
provide
us
with
an
opinion.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
the
county-wide
offices
would
only
require
25,000.
those
county
commissioners
running
from
the
city
of
chicago
itself
would
require
25,000
and
those
running
from
suburban
cook
county
would
require
25,000.
those
running
county
wide
could
combine
their
signatures
with
either
one
or
the
other.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
the
ruling
of
this
court
was
that,
as
we
understand
it
and
we
have
read
it
and
as
it
has
set
forth
by
other
courts,
including
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
is
that
the
total
number
of
signatures,
the
total
number
for
the
entire
petition,
is
25,000.
it
has
never
been
suggested,
and
in
fact,
the
same
section
of
the
statute
that
provides
for
each
component
to
have
25,000,
also
says
that
the
entire
petition
shall
not
be...
shall
not
be
required
to
exceed
25,000.
so
it
can't
be
both.
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
self-contradictory.
and
that
alone
would
invalidate
the
statute.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae,
american
civil
liberties
union,
addresses
that
at
great
length.
first
of
all,
when
you
ask
me
about
the
constitutional
requirement,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
freedom
of
association
under
the
first
amendment,
the
liberty
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
all
would
seem
to
suggest
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
in
that
it
requires
the
harold
washington
party
to
obtain
more
signatures
from
a
smaller
geographical
unit,
that
is
suburban
cook
county,
than
would
be
required
for
the
entire
state.
we
also
point
out
the
obvious
that...
chicago
itself
is,
of
course,
within
cook
county.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
but
we're
being
asked
to
get
50,000
for
county-wide
office.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
because
the
supreme
court
has
determined
that--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--no,
sir,
not
at
all.
that's
not
what's
unconstitutional
about
it.
what's
unconstitutional
is
requiring
the
excessive
number
of
signature
petitions,
in
effect
giving
suburban
voters
veto
power
over
the
expansion
of
the
harold
washington
party.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
he
asked
about
those
as
well
as
the
county-wide
offices.
perhaps
i
should
clarify.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
don't
know
what
that
provision
would
provide,
your
honor,
because
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
has
not
addressed
that
adequately
to
give
us
any
insight.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
signatures.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
because
that
then
requires
the
expansion
of
the
party
to
produce
50,000
rather
than
the
25,000
signatures.
but
more...
which
is
the
statewide
requirement.
so
you
now
have
a
party
running
county
wide,
getting
25,000
signatures
for
suburban
cook
county,
25,000
for
the
city
of
chicago,
which
is
also
within
cook
county,
and
using--
mr.
robert
e.
pincham,
jr.
--no,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
but
we
don't
know
how
many
to
produce
from
the
suburbs
and
how
many
to
produce
from
the
city
to
give
us
the
total
number
of
signatures
of
25,000.
and
our
state
supreme
court
has
not
given
us
the
insight
into
that
question.
thank
you,
your
honor.
