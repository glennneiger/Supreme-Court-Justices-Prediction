chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1126,
barbara
norman
v.
dorothy
reed,
and
90-1435,
cook
county
officers
electoral
board
v.
dorothy
reed.
mr.
pincham,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pincham.
mr.
gillis,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
your
client,
which
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
board
of
elections--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--held
or
decided
that
the
harold
washington
party
candidates
did
not
qualify
for
the...
is
it
the
sanitary
district
offices...
where
the
suburbs
elect,
and
they
simply
represent
the
suburbs
only.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
didn't
upset
that
determination,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are.
and
you
are
supporting
its
decision
to
exclude
the
suburban
candidates
running
for
suburban
offices
only?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gillis.
mr.
adamski,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it...
aren't
their
instances
in
illinois
where
the
two
major
parties
don't
put
up
complete
slates?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
is
the
justification
if
the
major
parties
aren't
subject
to
the
complete
slate
rule,
for
requiring
it
of
a
new
party?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
referring
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois'
decision
in
the
anderson
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
in
our
cases,
the
talk
about
a
two-party
system
as
being
a
valid
electoral
goal,
we
were
talking
in
terms
of
requiring
new
parties
to
do
almost
as
much,
or
perhaps
as
much,
as
the
established
parties.
but
illinois
requires
a
new
party
to
do
more,
apparently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
there's
been
a
past
track
record--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
support.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
excuse
me,
just
say
what
you
were
going
to
say.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
there
has
been
no
republican
candidate
in
a
particular
part
of
chicago
for
many,
many
years.
and
then
the
republicans
want
to
start
having
a
candidate
there.
they're
not
subject
to
this
full
slate
requirement,
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
people
in
the
city
of
chicago
do
vote,
say,
for
treasurer
of
cook
county.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
adamski.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1126,
norman
versus
reed
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
