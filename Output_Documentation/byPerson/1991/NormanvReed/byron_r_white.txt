justice
byron
r.
white
--what
did
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
say
about
this
matter,
about
the
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
don't
know
why
they
struck
the
harold
washington
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
more
or
the
same?
but
the
statewide
officers
only
need
to
get
25,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
that...
you're
in
effect
saying
that
it
must
be
unconstitutional
to
divide
cook
county
into
chicago
and
the
suburban
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
just
talking
about
the...
justice
stevens
is
just
talking
about
those
officers
running
for
places
on
the
suburban.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
say
that
you
didn't
get
on
the
ballot
at
all
because
you
didn't
get
a
sufficient
number
of
votes--
justice
byron
r.
white
--signatures
in
the
suburban
area,
you
got
fewer
than
25,000
in
the
suburban
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
the
state
may
constitutionally
divide
cook
county
into
city
and
suburban
area,
and
say
each
area...
signatures
from
each
area
must
be
over
25,000,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
couldn't
form
a
new
political
party
to
elect
just
those
members
of
the
county
commission
from
chicago?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
must
be
true
or
the
supreme
court
wouldn't
have
ruled
the
way
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
i
gather
that
though
in
this
case
because
the
suburban...
the
party,
new
party
didn't
get
enough
signatures
in
the
suburban
area
and
they
got
plenty
in
the
city.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
the
new
party
couldn't
run
in
either
the
city
or
the
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
for
the
county
positions.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
effect,
then,
the
people
who
are
running
for
county
commissioners
from
chicago,
even
though
they
had
more
than
25,000
votes...
or
signatures,
were
off
the
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
weren't
50,000
in
the
whole
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is...
why
doesn't
that
violate
our
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
really
not
arguing
that
they
struck
this
whole...
that
they
disqualified
the
candidates
from
chicago
as
well
as
from
suburbia
because
they
didn't
get
50,000
votes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
really
saying
they
were...
the
chicago
people
were
disqualified
because
of
the
full
slate
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
let
the
county
people
who
got
25,000...
the
chicago
people
who
got
25,000
votes
run
on
the
ballot?
why
couldn't
they
get
on
the
ballot?
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
they
want
to
run
under
the
party
name.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
it's
because
the
party
just
didn't
have
candidates
from
suburbia
that
had
enough
votes.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
and
therefore,
you
disqualified
the
chicago
people
as
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
are
saying
a
political
party
is
either
a
new
one
or
an
old
one,
and
this
was
a
new...
this
had
to
be
a
new
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
said...
and
then
they
said
it
was
new
when
they
filed
their
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean...
they
wanted
to
file
a
new...
for
a
new
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
old
party
was
just
formed
for
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
now
talking
about
a
new
political
unit.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
had
to
be
a
new
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
evidence
is
there
that...
did
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
say
that
this
party
was
not
qualified
to
use
the
harold
washington
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
say
why,
but
it
said
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
because
it
was
a
new
party
and
a
new
party
can't
use
the
same
name
as
an
old
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they're
forming
a
new
party
and
they
want
to
use
an
old
party's
name.
can
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
judgment?
