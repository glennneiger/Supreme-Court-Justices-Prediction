justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincham,
is
it
the
same
party?
i
mean
that's
one
of
the
controversies
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do...
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
the
same
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
record
says,
if
i
recollect
it,
is
that
the
city
harold
washington
party
had
no
objection
to
the
use
of
the
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
evident
to
those
who
had
to
make
the
initial
judgment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
to
whether
the
party
had
the
proper
number
of
signatures?
i
mean,
in
retrospect,
maybe
we
can
say,
well
it
is
one
in
the
same.
but
was
that
evident
to
those
that
had
to
make
the
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and
you
don't
have
to
give
it
right
away,
but
before
you're
done,
if
you
could
refer
me
to
that
part
of
the
record,
i'd
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
they
couldn't
write
the
opinion,
that's
why
they
never
wrote
it.
it
would
not
write
itself,
you
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
court
also
changed,
though,
didn't
they?
i
mean,
there
were
new
justices
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gillis,
it
may
well
be
a
harsh
rule,
but
what
is
wrong
with
a
state
rule
that
does
not
require
you
to
run
on
a
slate?
if
they
required
you
to
run
on
slate,
and
then
said
if
you...
you
must
run
on
a
slate
and
everybody
on
the
slate
must
get
all
the
votes,
then
that
would
be,
in
effect,
requiring
more
than
25,000
votes.
but
if
they
just
say
it's
up
to
you,
you
can
run
on
a
slate
or
not.
however,
if
you
chose
to
run
on
a
slate,
everybody
on
that
slate
must
be
properly
qualified.
why
is
that
an
unconstitutional
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
state
can
say,
you
know,
voters
are
going
to
be
misled.
they
think
their
voting
for
a
slate
when,
you
know,
when
in
fact
some
of
the
people
on
that
slate
don't
make
it.
they
might
have
voted
differently.
they
might
have
signed
the
petitions
differently.
you
don't
know
how
many
people
would
have
signed
the
petitions
for
these
individuals.
they
signed
for
them
as
members
of
a
slate.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
hypothetical.
they
do
not
require
a
complete
slate.
they
just
say
if
you
chose
to
go
as
a
slate,
and
that's
how
you
get
your
petitions
signed,
then,
by
george,
every
member
of
that
slate
has
to
be
qualified,
otherwise,
you've
misrepresented
what
you're
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
listening
to...
i
am
not
requiring
them
to
get
a
slate.
you
don't
have
to
get
a
slate.
if
you
want
to
run
individually,
you
may.
but
if
you
run
on
a
slate,
everybody
on
your
slate
has
to
be
qualified.
now
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
our
cases
also
say
that
you
can't
require
more
support
for
a
subdivision
of
the
state
than
you
require
for
the
whole
state.
and
the
whole
state
you
only
require
25,000,
whereas
for
cook
county
you
require
50,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
figure
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
cook
county
is
just
one
county.
sangamon
and
cook
county
are
two
counties,
and
that's
50,000,
and
that's
fine.
25,000
in
each
county.
cook
county
is
just
one
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
unreasonable
when
you
require
more
from
the
county
than
you
would
to
have
for
somebody
to
run
statewide.
i
mean,
yes,
they
are
big
numbers
you
gave
me
for
the
number
of
voters
in
cook
county
and
in
the
city
of
chicago,
which
is
part
of
cook
county,
for
the
purposes
of
the
breakout
in
counties,
right?
this
is
one
county
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
and
the
board
of
county
commissions,
they
are
county
commissioners
of
cook
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
of
them
are
elected
from
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
is
that
a
separate
political
sub...
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
separate
political
subdivision
if
you
have
a
board
of
county
commissioners
that
governs
both
the
county
and
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
adamski,
you
don't
contest
that
the
harold
washington
party
is
the
harold
washington
party,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no
wait.
could
they
have
come
into
cook
county
and
said
we
are
an
old
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
you're
a
new
party
if
you
are
new
in
the
elective
unit
that
the
election
pertains
to.
they
were...
they
had
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
okay.
that's
why
they
said
they
were
a
new
party.
of
course
they
were
a
new
party
in
cook
county,
in
suburban
cook
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
were
criticizing
them
for
being
a
new
party,
now
you
say
yeah,
of
course,
they
were
a
new
party.
well
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait
a
minute.
of
course
a
new
party
can
use
an
old
party's
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
a
new
party.
a
new
party
in
the
political
unit,
in
the
sense
that
it's
new
to
that
political
unit,
can
use
the
name
of
an
old
party
from
another
political
unit.
you
mean
a
party
cannot
expand
in
your
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you're
saying
that
it
was
new
in
that
sense,
that
it
is
not
the
same
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
weren't
there
findings
against
you
on
that?
didn't
the
board
simply
find
that
it
was
the
same
party?
