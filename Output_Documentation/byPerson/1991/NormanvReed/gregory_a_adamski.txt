mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
nothing
about
complete
slate.
the
issue
concerning
the
complete
slate
is
simply
this.
that
seven
people
who
were
on
this
ticket
did
not
get
enough
nomination
signatures.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
nomination
petition
that
was
submitted
for
the
formation
of
the
new
political
party,
that
is
the
county-wide
harold
washington
party,
was
not
in
proper
form.
the
fact
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
struck
it
down
was
for
that
very
reason.
there
were
three
things
before
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
first
issue
was
the
harold
washington
party
use...
the
use
of
the
harold
washington
party
name
by
this
new
political
party.
the
second
was
the
25
signature
requirement
for
each
of
the
units.
and
the
third
was
the
propriety
of
the
form...
of
the
petition.
and
on
behalf
of
my
clients,
who
were
objectors
to
these
petitions,
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
correct
in
all
three
instances.
now
unfortunately,
i
don't
know
what
the
reasons
were
for
their
decisions,
but
i
can
read
their
decisions,
and
i
believe
their
decisions
are
correct.
concerning
the
name
violation,
the
petition
that
was
actually
submitted
here
was
a
petition
for
a
new
political
party.
it
was
a
petition
for
a
new
political
party
that
was
called
the
harold
washington
party.
mr.
evans,
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
yes.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
next
page,
there's...
you
are
correct,
justice,
that
there
were...
there
are
two
separate
petitions
here.
one
petition
is
for
the
city
and
one
petition
is
for
the
county.
but
this
is
a
party
formation
party.
this
is
a
party
formation
issue,
your
honor.
these
people
were
forming
a
party
to
run
concerning
county
issues,
the
needs
of
the
county,
the
goals
of
the
county,
the
aspirations
of
the
county.
and
it's
not
unreasonable,
and
it's
certainly...
it
certainly
is
not,
i
believe,
unconstitutional
that
the
state
of
illinois
requires
that
if
you're
going
to
run
in
the
county,
and
the
county
has
more
than
one
political
subdivision,
that
you
have
to
come
up
with...
a
modicum
of
support.
in
this
instance,
25,000
signatures.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
they
were
submitted
as
part
of
the
same
petition,
i
believe.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
that's
correct
because
they're
running
as
a
party.
and
the
fact
is
that
when
you
form...
the
law
gives
special
benefits
to
the--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--no,
i
would
have
a
different
objection.
and
that
is
there
is
a
section
of
the
statute
that
says
you
have
to
put
forward
a
complete
slate
of
candidates
for
all
positions...
for
all
offices
that
are
to
be
filled.
so
in
order
for
them
to
have
complied
with
the
electoral--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--for
that...
for
the
particular
contest
that
you
are
petitioning
to
run
in.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
but
the
contest
included
the
election
of
commissioners
from
the
city
and
from
the
suburbs.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
it
didn't.
the
fact
is
that
the
section
of
the...
i
believe
it's
10-5,
the
section
of
the
electoral
code
that
concerns
this
issue
specifically
says
that
you
must
put
forth
a
complete
slate.
and
that
has
been
upheld
in
anderson
v.
schneider.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
all
county
officers
and
county
commissioners.
for
everyone
who
is
running
in
that
particular
political
subdistrict
election
at
that
time.
and
the
idea
of
that,
if
i
may
suggest
this
to
the
court,
is
that
you
not
only
want
to
show
that
people
that
you
have
25,000
voters,
or
a
modicum
of
support,
you
not
only
want
to
show
that
you
have
that
modicum
of
support
from
both
areas,
but
you
want
to
show
that
you
have
people
in
both
areas
who
will
represent
both
areas.
and
the
idea
here
is
that
there
are
10--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
that
the
illinois
electoral
code
gives
that
advantage
to--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--well,
the
supreme
court
could
have
ruled
otherwise.
isn't
it...
the
supreme
court
could
have
come
down
on
other
grounds
then.
the
supreme
court
could
say
that
because...
and
i
suggest
to
you
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
did
conclude
did
conclude...
that
the
petition
was
in
improper
form,
that
the
entire
petition
was
not
properly
presented
because
it
did
not
have
candidates.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
well,
your
honor,
this
goes
to
the
issue
that
this
court
has
addressed
in
anderson
and
in
the
other,
what
we'll
call
classification
scheme,
cases.
the--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--no,
i'm
referring
to
anderson
v.
celebrezzi,
this
court's
decision.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
an
interest
in
promoting
the
two-party
system
and
i
believe
that
monroe
stands
for
that
proposition.
i
believe
that
there's
language
to
that
effect
in
socials
workers.
the
state
has
a
right
to
set
up
certain
restrictions
in
allowing
new
parties.
now
there's
a
gigantic
advantage,
and
the
state
of
illinois
favors,
in
fact,
party
formation.
there's
a
gigantic
advantage
to
running
as
a
party,
because
the
party
only
has
to
come
up
with
25,000.
it
only
has
to
comply
with
the
number
of
votes...
signatures
on
the
nominating
ballots
for
the
district
in
which
it
is
running.
if
individuals
ran,
if
you
are
running
as
an
independent,
you
have
to
come
up
with
25,000
each
yourself.
so
what
the
state
does
is,
the
state
of
illinois
makes
a
determination.
we
can
run
the
whole
spectrum
of
ballot
access
here.
there
can
be
no
ballot
access
or
you
can
have
complete
ballot
access.
and
the
state
of
illinois
says
for
new
party
formation
it's
25,000.
and
the
additional
price
that
you
have
to
pay
to
get
that
advantage
is
that
you
have
to
show
us
that
you
have
a
full
slate
of
candidates
that
you...
that
you
can
field
people
of
common
interest,
common
goals--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
all
the
states
that
require
new
parties
to
come
up
with
certain...
a
number
of
nominating
petitions
require
those
new
parties
to
do
more
than
a
party
where
that
for
instance--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--right.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
no,
that
isn't
what
i
was
going
to
say,
if
i
may
excuse
you.
in
the
instance--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--in
the
instance
where
no
one
has
run
for
an
officer,
in
the
instance
where
say,
an
office
has
been
held
by
democratic
party
holders
for
years
and
years
and
years,
and
there
is
no
republican
party
holder,
there's
no
restriction
there.
and
there's
a
restriction...
there's
a
greater
restriction
on
the
person
who's
coming
into
that
area.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
no,
they're
not
because
they're
an
established
party.
and
that...
if
it
please
the
court,
that
is
the
price
that
illinois
puts
on
new
parties.
if
you're
going
to
come
in
and
be
a
new
party,
if
you're
going
to
take
advantage
of
this
liberal
25,000
requirement,
then
you
simply
have
to
have
a
full
slate
of
people.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
the
state
interest
is
that
the
state
while
it
encourages
party
formation
wants
to
be
certain
that
individuals...
that
you
put
forth
a
full
party.
that
you
are
putting
forth
for
the
voters--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--i
don't
know
that
you're
correct
that
the
republican
would
not
be
subject
to
attack.
i
don't
know...
or
the
democrat,
whoever
it
is--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--well,
i...
there's
no
state
interest
in
that.
there's
none.
i
think
the
court
has
taken
in
these
cases...
the
court...
the
language
of
the
court
is
that
there
is
no
litmus
paper
test.
and
the
court
has
looked
in
a
fact-intensive
basis
into
each
one
of
these
cases
to
see
where
the
burdens
are.
now
the
state's
interest,
and
mr.
justice
white
in
the
monroe
case
specifically
said
and
noted
that
this
court
has
never
made
a
particularized
review...
required
a
particularized
proof
from
a
state
as
to
the
needs,
as
to
the
state's
interest
in
regulations,
so
long
as
those
regulations
are
reasonable.
and
so
the
court
has
to
look
on
a
factual
basis,
in
effect,
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
these.
now
the
requirement
of
25,000...
we've
thrown
that
around,
but
in
fact
the
requirement
is
a
percentage
requirement.
it
is
the
percentage
requirement
of
5
percent
maxed
out
under
the
socialist
workers
case
at
25,000.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
no
evidence
in
this
record
whatsoever,
that
unduly
burdened
these
people.
these
people
simply
came
in,
they
put
their
ballot...
they
put
their
nominee...
nomination
petitions
in
and
made
no
effort
or
record
that
they
had
a
difficulty
to
expand.
essentially
what
they're
telling
you
here,
what
they're
asking
you
to
do
is
because
they
didn't
comply
with
the
law,
they
want
you
to
strike
the
law
down
so
they
can
run
anywhere
they
want.
now
the
state
has
an
interest,
and
i
think
all
the
parties
agree,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
regulating
these
elections,
and
there's
no,
i
suggest
to
the
court,
there's
no--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
for
the
county
positions.
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
your
honor,
the
cases
say
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
put
restrictions
on
to
show
that
a
particular
party
has
a
modicum
of
support.
these
people
were
saying...
these
people
were
representing
to
the
public,
and
to
their
competitors
in
the
other
parties,
that
they
were
a
party
that
had
county-wide
interests.
they
didn't.
they
didn't
have--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--unless--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--the
case...
i
think
you're
referring
to
the
socialist
workers
case
in
particular,
that
case
says
unless
there's
a
good
reason.
socialist
workers
was
a
situation,
your
honor,
where
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
moore,
the
city
of
chicago
had
requirements
for
ballots,
ballot
nominations,
three
times
greater
than
the
state
of
illinois.
and
this
court
struck
that
down
and
in
effect
amended...
our
legislature
did
it,
but
in
effect
amended
the
state
law
to
say
25,000
was
the
cap.
but
in
that
very
case,
that
25,000
that
this
court
was
talking
about
was
the
25,000
from
chicago.
and
this
court
recognizes,
justice
stevens
recognized
in
his
footnote
3
of
that
opinion,
that
the
25,000
requirement
was
a
requirement
for
all
political
subcomponents.
our
law
in
illinois
requires
if...
let's
take
for
example
one
of
our
counties
is
called
sangamon
county.
it's
in
springfield,
illinois.
if
these
people
wanted
to
go
to
sangamon
county,
they'd
have
to...
and
they
wanted
to
form
their
new
party
there...
there's
nothing
in
our
law
that
stops
them
from
doing
that...
they'd
have
to
come
up
with
5
percent
of
the
people
in
sangamon
county.
if
they're
going
to
go
around
and
form
parties
in
every
city
and
every
county
in
the
state,
they're
going...
i'm
saying
this
to
you,
your
honor,
because
i
want
you
to
understand
we're
talking
about
a
lot
more
than
50,000
here.
the
fact
is
that
before
they
get
to
go
into
those
areas--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--cook
county
has
900...
650,000
registered
voters
in
the
last
election.
the
city
of
chicago
has
850,000.
when
you're
looking...
let's
take
this
first
on
the
idea
of
reasonableness.
when
you're
looking
at
the
reasonableness
of
this,
this
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket,
i
suggest
to
you.
when
you're
talking
next
about
why
have
the
difference,
the
difference
is
based
upon
this
court's
discipline
in
all
of
its
cases
that
says
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
demand
that
someone
has
a
modicum
of
support.
these
people
should
not
have
the
right,
under
our
state
law
and
under
good
representative
participatory
government
and
democracy,
they
should
not
have
the
right
to
simply
go
into
any
area
they
want
and
run
their
party,
unless
they
have
people
there
who
are
going
to
support
them.
and
the
5
percent
rule,
i
suggest
to
you
is
not
unreasonable
and
does
not
unduly
burden
them.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
but
the
city
of
chicago
is
a
completely
separate
political
subdistrict
under
the
illinois
electoral
board.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
of
the
state.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
you
wouldn't
permit
the
people
from
chicago
who
got
their
25,000
votes
to
run
in
the
election
because
the
suburbanites
didn't
get
enough
votes.
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--i
don't
know
about
a
full
slate
rule.
i
know
that
the
petition
wasn't
in
proper
form.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
your
honor,
well,
because
that's
not
what
the
rules
provide.
if
they
want
to
run
as
independents,
then
each
of
them
has
to
get
25,000--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--but
the
party
they
put
forward,
and
this
goes
back,
i
guess
to
what
justice
stevens
was
pointing
out,
the
party
that
they
ran
for
was
a
party
that
had
more
people
in
it
than
they
had
support
from.
and
that
made
their
petition
infirm.
it
made
their
petition
improper.
it
made
their
petition
invalid.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
exactly
why.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
the
chicago
people
were
running...
this
is
a
county
election,
your
honor.
the
chicago
people
were
running
in
a
county
election
for
county
positions.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
and
there's
good
reasons
why
you
shouldn't
let
that
happen.
you
shouldn't
allow
the
city
people...
in
this
instance,
you
shouldn't
allow
the
city
people
to
attempt
to
take
over
county
positions
without
having
support
throughout
the
county.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
axiomatic.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
if
they
were
a
party?
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
no.
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
they
were--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--if
they
ran
a
full
slate--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--right.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
i
agree
with
that.
yes,
i
do
agree.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
so
long
as
the
candidate
for
county--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--yes.
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
10
of
them
are.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
for
purposes
of
the
county
board
elections,
the
statute...
and
this
is
not
just
in
chicago,
this
is
in
any
county
that
has
a
similar
county
board...
the
statutes
provide
that
if
you
have...
if
you're
running
for
more
than
one
component,
then
you
have
to
show
a
modicum
of
support
from
both
components.
an
example
might
be
for
the...
i'm
not
sure
if
this
is
accurate...
i'll
give
this
example
to
the
court
and
tell
you
that
i
think
it
is,
but
the
state
senate
positions
run
for
more
than
one
county.
you
have
to
show
a
modicum
of
support
from
the
various
places
that
you
run
from
that
is
outside
the
city
of
chicago,
in
the
southern
areas
of
the
state,
the
central
areas
of
the
state,
and
western
areas
of
the
state.
so
i
don't
think
that
that's
unreasonable.
this
is
a
county
position
and
you
need
to
show
county
support
if
you
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
ameliorative
party
formation
laws
in
the
state
of
illinois.
if
you
want
to
run...
if
a
group
of
individuals
want
to
run
as
a
group
of
individuals,
then
each
of
them
has
to
go
and
get
that
number
of
votes,
25,000
or
5
percent.
but
if
they
want
to
run
together
as
a
group
and
take
advantage
of
this,
this
law,
then
they
have
to
get
the
support
from
every
component
that
there
is.
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
factual
basis
here
is
that
i
said
first
that
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
25,000
requirement
burdens
anyone.
there's
no
evidence
to
that
effect
before
the
court.
likewise,
there's
no
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
filing
of
a
proper
form
burdens
anyone.
they
simply
didn't
do
that.
the
harold
washington
party
is
alive
and
well
in
chicago.
it
has
run
in
two
city
elections
in
the
last
2
years
and
has
done
very
well
for
itself.
the
brief
that
i
filed
points
out,
and
i
don't
think
i
need
to
go
into
much
detail
on
this,
that
if
they
want
to
expand,
the
mechanisms
are
there
for
them
to
expand.
they
simply,
in
this
case,
did
not
follow
those
mechanisms.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
about
a
requirement,
the
two
requirements...
that
you
file
a
proper
form
and
the
requirement
that
you
file
25,000
signatures
from
each
unit
to
get
to...
take
advantage
of
the
new
party
laws
in
illinois.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
i
do.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
it's
not.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
this
harold
washington
party
is
mr.
pincham's
harold
washington
party.
mr.
evans
ran
in
a
special
election
against
mayor
daly
in
1989,
i
believe,
and
he
formed
the
harold
washington
party
for
the
city
of
chicago.
he
never
appointed
any
committeemen,
he
never
held
any
caucuses,
he
never
held
any...
he
had
no
primaries,
nothing.
in
august
of
1990,
mr.
pincham
came
in
with
petitions
at
this
time
and
at
the
time
he
ran
on
the
harold
washington
party...
mr.
evans,
by
the
way,
was
a
functionary
of
the
democratic
party,
he
held
an
office
in
the
democratic
party
of
cook
county...
mr.
pincham
came
in
and
filed
these
document.
and
the
documents
say
that
it's
a
new
political
party.
the
documents
say
that.
now,
at
the
hearing
before
the
board,
the
electoral
board,
mr.
evans
testified
that
he
had
authorized
it.
well,
the
law
doesn't
give
mr.
evans
the
right
to
authorize
it.
the
law...
once
parties
are
formed,
parties
are
very
serious
matters,
and
once
they
are
formed
they
are
regulated
by
law.
they
had
to
hold
a
convention,
they
had
to
hold
a
caucus,
they
had
to
hold
a
primary.
mr.
evans
only
had
authority
to
point
interim
committeemen
under
section
10-2
of
the
electoral
code,
i
believe.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
this
is
a
party
formation
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
no,
they've
taken
the
position...
they
said
it
was
new,
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
since
then
they've
taken
the
position
that
all
they
were
really
doing
was
expanding.
be
that
as
it
may--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--i
believe
they
could
have,
yes.
i
believe
that
they
could
have
filed
nominating
petitions
for
the
formation
of
the
harold
washington
party
in
cook
county,
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
they
are
new.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
the
were
a
new
party.
they
were
a
new
party.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
they
were
mr.
pincham...
i've
taken
a...
maybe
i
just--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
yes.
it
did
not
say
why.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
it
can
use
somebody
else's
name.
the
party
continuity
issue
there
is
a
different
issue.
you
can't...
they
can't
come
forward
and
say
we're
going
to
use
somebody
else's
name
when
the
name's
already
been...
in
use.
they
can't
do
that.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
i'd
like
to
think
so.
[laughter]
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
if
it
has
the
permission
of
the
old
party.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
a
party
can
expand,
but
it
has
to
be
the
same
party.
they
weren't
the
same
party.
this
was
a
brand
new
political
party.
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
if
there's
no
more
questions,
i
would--
mr.
gregory
a.
adamski
--yes.
the
board
found
that
it
was
the
same
party.
the
circuit
court,
which
reviewed
it
de
novo,
essentially
affirmed
the
board.
i
don't
think
that
circuit
court
made
any
findings
on
that
issue,
but
it
essentially
affirmed
the
board.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
and
i
thank
you.
