mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
might
follow
up
on
the
last
question.
there
are
two
districts
in
cook
county,
the
large
city
of
chicago
and
the
large
suburban
area.
each
has
over
a
million
registered
voters.
the...
after
this
court's
ruling
in
1979
in
the
socialist
workers
case,
illinois
put
a
cap
of
25,000
signatures
on
any
large
district.
so
that's
what
you
need
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
harold
washington
party
did
obtain
25,000...
in
fact,
44,000...
signatures
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
these
petitions
had
two
components,
the
county-wide
candidates
at
the
top,
and
the
city
of
chicago
candidates
also
on
the
same
petition.
so
my
client,
the
electoral
board
ruled
that
they
had
qualified
to
run
county-wide
at-large
candidates
as
well
as
candidates
in
the
city
of
chicago
for
county
commissioner.
on
the
other
hand,
and
this
is
the
one
point
we
differ
with
the
harold
washington
party,
the
harold
washington
party
only
filed
7,800
signatures
in
the
suburban
area,
or
about
one-half
of
1
percent
of
the
million
and
some
registered
voters
there
are
in
the
area.
the
cook
county
electoral
board
held
that
that
did
not
show
a
modicum
of
support,
and
hence
did
not
let
them
on
the
ballot
in
the
suburban
area.
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
seems
to
have
done,
although
they
did
not
use
these
words,
is
to
apply
what's
known
in
illinois
law
as
the
complete
slate
requirement.
it
amounts
to
a
rule
that
if
any
one
of
your
candidates
is
off,
they
all
go
off.
the
illinois
supreme
court's
order
stated
that
since
there
were
not
sufficient
signatures
in
the
suburbs,
all
the
candidates
went
off.
this
court's
order
of
last
october
25th
stayed
that
order
and
upheld
the
order
of
my
client,
the
electoral
board,
which
says
if
you
qualify
in
the
city,
and
you
can
show
a
modicum
of
support
there,
those
candidates
go
on.
and
also
the
at-large
candidates
went
on.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
illinois
supreme
court's
order,
and
the
feeling
behind
that,
could
be
shown
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
a
1977
illinois
case
called
anderson
v.
schneider.
that
shows
the
workings
of
the
complete
slate
rule,
or
the...
at
least
the
thoughts
of
some
of
the
justices
about
that.
i
submit
that
is
a
harsh
rule
and
one
that
intends
to
block
ballot
access.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
believe
it
was.
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
general
and
i
believe
that
it
covers
the
complete
slate
requirement.
it's
in
the
last
page
of
the
appendix.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
right.
the
cook
county
officers
electoral--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--well,
that
issue
did
not
get
by...
that
was
not
decided
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
so
i
do
not
believe
that
issue
is
before
the
court.
but
they
ruled
an
insufficient
number
of
signatures
on
those
petitions.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
no.
they
were
held
insufficient.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
to
run
with
a
political
party,
to
run
with
other
persons
of
a
like
mind
set
and
a
like
platform,
is
a
political
advantage.
if
you
said
that
these
people
can
just
run
individually,
i
think
that
puts
them
in
an
inferior
position
when
facing
other...
the
established
political
parties
that
have
a
banner
and
have
a
number
of
candidates.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
really
see
no
state
interest
in
requiring
a
complete
slate.
the...
what
is
required--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--well,
one
vice
to
that
is
moore
v.
ogilvie,
which
if
you
required
them
to
get
a
complete
slate
in
both
the
city
and
the
county,
a
party
could
be
quite
popular
and
show
a
modicum
of
support
in
one
district,
but
not
in
the
other.
if
you
would--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i
think
it's...
i'm
sorry,
i
think
it
violates
the
requirement
that
if
a
person...
party
qualifies
in
one
district
that
they
should
be
on
the
ballot
as
happened
in
this
case.
and
if...
that
there,
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
chose
to
run
under
a
party
banner.
and
i
think
that's
their
right.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
that's
right.
and
that
that
was
the
one--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--no,
i
am.
i
am
supporting.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes,
because
only
7,008
signatures
were
brought
forth
and
the
board
found
that
that
does
not
show
a
modicum
of
support.
to
the--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--right.
that
would
be
about
2-1/2
percent.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
when
the
supreme
court...
i'm
sorry,
i
may
have
used
a
shorthand,
but
when
the
supreme
court
held
that
by
failing
to
qualify
in
the
suburbs--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--the
illinois
supreme
court's
order
said
you
failed
to
get
enough
signatures
in
the
suburbs,
then
you're
off
the
ballot
entirely.
that
is
the
workings
of
what
we
call
in
illinois
the
complete
slate
requirement.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
well,
it
is
wrapped
up
in
the
issue
about
whether
it's
constitutionally
permissible
to
take
the
complete...
to
take
the
harold
washington
party
off
the
ballot.
that's
how
it's
phrased
in
the
petition.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
the
first
one:
whether
it's
constitutionally
impermissible
to
knock
the
harold
washington
party
off
the
ballot.
because
it
imposes
conditions
that
there's
no
compelling
state
interest.
what's
at
work
there
is
the
state
rule
that
if
one
candidate
is
off,
they
all
go
off.
and
that's
illustrated,
as
i
said
in
anderson
v.
schneider.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
going
to
justice
steven's
point
about
the
name,
that
is
displayed
in
a
transcript
of
august
21st
at
page
25,
and
august
24th
at
page
4.
the
cook
county
officers
electoral
board
interpreted
section
10-5,
one
of
the
members
said
that
10-5
did
not
even
apply
to
this.
and
they
found...
the
board
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
10-5.
i
think
what's
implicit
in
that
is
the
court's
opinion
in
eu
v.
san
francisco,
which
states
that
political
parties
ought
to
be
allowed
to
fashion
their
own
business
if
that
doesn't
interfere
with
some
compelling
state
interest
such
as
the
manner
of
running
elections
or
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
don't
think
there's
any
state
interest.
i
think
that
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible.
the
only
thing
that
mr.
adamski--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i
think
it's
discriminatory
against
new
political
parties.
established
political
parties
don't
have
to
do
that.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
held
in
the
case
i've
been
citing,
anderson
v.
schneider,
that
if
one
candidate
goes
off,
in
some
instances
the
others
go
on.
and
i
think
basically
there's
no
compelling
state
interest,
no
good
reason,
to
knock
all
of
the
candidates
off
if
one
happens
to
go
off
or
be
found
unqualified
for
the
ballot.
and
in
this
case
it
works
a
further
vexatious
result
that
these
candidates
brought
forth
44,000
signatures
and
enough
to
qualify
under
illinois
law,
and
oops,
because
they
did
not
qualify
in
one
district,
they
could
be
off.
this
could
go
on
in
many
jurisdictions.
we
just
have
to
find
one
county
or
one
state
representative
district
where
somebody
doesn't
qualify,
and
you
could
disqualify
the
whole
ticket,
i
think
that's
just
constitutionally
impermissible.
it's
another
hoop
to
make
new
political
parties
jump
through
that
existing
political
parties
do
not
have
to.
the
name
issue,
i
think
the
board
found
the
name
was
not
improper.
the
trial
court
affirmed
on
that
issue.
and
i
submit
that
the
political
party
should
be
allowed
to
manage
its
own
business.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i
thank
the
court
and
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
cook
county
officers
electoral
board.
