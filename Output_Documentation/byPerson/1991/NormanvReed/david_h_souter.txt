justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
review
constitutional
challenges
to
the
illinois
law
setting
requirements
replacing
the
names
of
candidates
of
the
new
political
party
on
the
voting
ballot.
the
harold
washington
party
has
been
an
established
political
party
in
the
city
of
chicago
since
1989.
in
1990,
the
petitioners
in
this
action
tried
to
expand
the
party
to
cook
county
by
preparing
a
list
of
candidates
in
november
1990
county
elections
and
gathering
nominating
signatures
from
thousands
of
county
residents.
the
support,
however,
was
geographically
uneven,
they
collected
many
more
signatures
from
the
urban
district
of
cook
county
then
from
the
county's
suburban
district.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
denied
petitioners'
access
to
the
cook
county
ballot
on
two
state
law
grounds.
first,
it
ruled
that
petitioners
could
not
organize
under
the
name
harold
washington
party
in
cook
county
because
there
already
was
an
established
party
by
that
designation
in
the
city
of
chicago.
second,
the
court
held
that
petitioners'
failure
to
gather
25,000
nominating
signatures
from
the
suburban
district
of
cook
county
has
qualified
their
candidates
for
all
county
officers,
not
just
those
representing
the
suburban
district.
we
state
the
mandate
of
the
state
supreme
court
and
permitted
petitioners
to
fill
rather
harold
washington
party
candidates
for
all
cook
county
offices
except
those
representing
the
suburban
district.
we
then
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
their
candidates
were
entitled
to
the
places
on
the
ballot
that
a
state
order
effectively
gave
them.
although
we
affirm
the
portion
of
the
state
supreme
court's
decision
denying
petitioners
the
right
to
fill
candidates
for
the
suburban
district
offices,
we
reverse
as
to
all
other
matters
considered
by
the
state
court
and
we
remand
for
consideration
of
one
further
issue
on
which
the
state
court
did
not
rule.
the
first
amendment
protects
the
right
of
citizens
to
create
and
develop
new
political
parties.
thus,
the
state
must
justify
restrictions
on
access
of
new
parties
to
state
and
local
ballots.
we
hold
that
illinois
did
not
have
sufficient
grounds
for
keeping
candidates
running
under
the
name
of
the
harold
washington
party
off
the
entire
cook
county
ballot.
to
the
extent
that
illinois
law
would
keep
new
party
candidates
in
one
locality
from
ever
adapting
the
name
of
an
established
party
in
another
locality
would
unreasonably
and
unconstitutionality
suppress
the
growth
of
any
new
party
that
could
not
run
a
statewide
campaign.
now,
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
voter
confusion
can
be
served
by
requiring
candidates
to
get
formal
permission
to
use
the
name
from
the
established
party
they
seek
to
represent.
here,
the
record
reveals
that
the
harold
washington
party
established
in
chicago
had
authorized
petitioners
to
use
the
party
name
in
cook
county.
we
also
hold
that
the
state
may
not
constitutionally
require
petitioners
as
a
prerequisite
to
filling
any
candidates
for
county
office
to
gather
25,000
nominating
signatures
from
each
of
the
county's
two
electoral
districts.
that
rule
would
effectively
make
petitioners
collect
50,000
signatures
to
fill
their
stated
candidates
whereas,
those
organizing
new
party
solely
for
statewide
elections
would
need
to
gather
only
25,000.
illinois
does
not
have
a
good
reason
for
asking
organizations
of
new
local
parties
to
show
twice
as
much
populous
support
as
organizations
of
statewide
parties.
thus,
while
the
harold
washington
party's
lack
of
suburban
support
justifies
keeping
its
candidates
off
the
ballot
for
suburban
district
offices
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
disqualifying
its
candidates
for
other
county
offices.
we
remand
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
address
an
issue
that
it
did
not
resolve
earlier
which
was
whether
petitioners'
failure
to
list
candidates
for
judicial
office
in
cook
county
disqualifies
their
candidates
for
other
county
officers
to
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
state's
complete
slate
requirement.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
taken
no
part
in
the
consideration
and
decision
of
the
case.
