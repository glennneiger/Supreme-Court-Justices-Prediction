unknown
speaker
then
why
don't
you
simply
argue
that
this
is
a
misapplication
or
a
failure
to
apply
teague
by
in
effect
applying
a
new
rule
or
a
new
and
more
specific
application
of
the,
of,
as
it
were,
of
jackson,
of
any
rule
attacking
the
unexplained
possession
theory,
that
it
arose
after
the
date
of
conviction
and
therefore
it
shouldn't
be
applied
under
teague?
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
a
separate
category
of
mixed
law
and
fact?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
really
need,
then,
a
separate,
or
a
specific
rule
for
mixed
questions.
all
you
need
is
a,
in
effect
a
clear
statement,
or
a
clearer
statement
perhaps,
of
when
teague
applies
and
when
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
court
had
not
instructed
the
jury
with
reference
to
the
inference,
and
it
just
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury,
and
we
later
find
out
from
say
closing
argument
of
counsel
or
by
examining
the
jurors
after
the
verdict
that
the
jurors
did
indeed
rely
on
this
inference
as
a
common
sense
inference.
could
the
petitioner
then
ask
the
federal
court
for
review
based
on
the
theory
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient?
unknown
speaker
but
habeas
review
would
then
lie
in
this
case?
you
may
win,
you
may
lose,
but
the
court
would,
in
your
view,
have
the
right
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
to
determine
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
just
the
presence
of
the
inference
in
this
case
that
makes
federal,
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
inappropriate?
unknown
speaker
let's
strike
the
word
jurisdiction.
whether
or
not
it's
appropriate
for
the
federal
court
to
exercise
its
authority.
if
teague
applies,
then
i
take
it
it
is
inappropriate?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
little
bit
of
an
elision
of
some
of
the
factors
in
teague,
that
the
only
question
is
was
the
state
court
decision
reasonable.
if
it's
simply
an
application
of
existing
constitutional
law
to
the
facts
of
a
case,
it
isn't
enough
that
the
state
court
decision
be
reasonable.
it
really
has
to
be
correct,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
every
single
fact
situation
isn't
an
original
inquiry
under
the
law.
i
mean,
there
are
settled
principles
of
law
that
apply
to
different
fact
situations.
you
would
agree
with
that,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
there
are
going
to
be
gray
areas
where
there
is
argument
as
to
whether
this
was
fore-ordained
by
prior
decisions
or
whether
it's
an
expansion
under
teague,
but
you
can
certainly
have
some
issues
or
some
fact
situations
which,
although
not
precisely
covered
by
a
prior
constitutional
decision,
nonetheless
would
not
be
regarded
as
a
new
rule,
can
you
not?
unknown
speaker
okay.
well
now
take
the
case
where
the
fact
situation
was
close
enough
to
be
dictated
by
prior
precedent.
in
that
case
it's
not
enough
that
the
state
court
decision
be,
quote,
reasonable,
close
quote.
it
has
to
be
correct
on
the
law,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
the
eyes
of
the
federal
habeas
court,
although
perhaps
the
federal
habeas
court's
view
of
the
law
might
not
correspond
to
that
of
some
other
court.
unknown
speaker
do
i
take
it
that
the
conclusion
of
your
colloquy
with
the
chief
justice
is
that
the
teague
issue
here
is
analyzed
substantially
the
same
way
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
instructed
with
reference
to
the
inference?
unknown
speaker
and
by
the
same,
just
to
nail
it
down,
i
think
you
are
also
saying
that
even
if
we
conclude
that
jackson
v.
virginia
was
correctly
applied,
you
still
win
under
teague?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to
rest,
i
mean,
are
you
going
to
rest
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
here
purported
to
be
applying
jackson
and
asking
the
question
could
a
rational
jury
have
decided
it
this
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--i
suppose
you
would
be
satisfied
to
win
on,
if
we
just
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
they
misapplied
jackson,
that
here
a
rational
jury
could
have
convicted.
unknown
speaker
if
teague
had
been...
excuse
me,
chief
justice.
the
fact
that
the
court
asked
a
question
does
not
mean
that
your
own
questions,
of
course,
are
superceded.
unknown
speaker
if
teague
had
been
on
the
books
would
jackson,
should
jackson
have
been
analyzed
differently
and
decided
differently?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
asking
us
to
cut
back
on
jackson?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
were,
in
teague,
just
talking
about
questions
of
law.
unknown
speaker
weren't
we?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
now
you
want
to
expand
it
to
cover
application
of
law
to
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
curry.
ms.
mahoney.
unknown
speaker
well,
what,
what
does
your
position
do
to
jackson
against
virginia?
unknown
speaker
well,
jackson
against
virginia
is
awfully
deferential.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
isn't
de
novo,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with
that
standard?
why
shouldn't
a
habeas
court
see,
ask
that
question
that
jackson
asks?
unknown
speaker
if
it
rejects,
it
rejects...
what's
wrong
with,
what's
the
difference
between
the
question
that
jackson
wants
asked
and
what
you
say
is
proper?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state,
the
state
court,
appellate
courts
have
to
apply
the
jackson
standard.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
point,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
and
that
once
they
go
through
with
it
we
should
never
disagree,
the
federal
courts
should
never
disagree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
determine
that
other
than
by
asking?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
determine
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
de
novo.
it's
not,
you
aren't
talking
about
de
novo
review.
you're
just
talking
about
a
choice
between
a
jackson
type
of
review,
which
certainly
isn't
de
novo,
and
a,
and
review
in
your
terms.
unknown
speaker
it
still
isn't
de
novo.
you
wouldn't
say
we
think
this
is...
you
still
say
do
you
think
any
reasonable
judge
could
have
arrived
at
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
but
we'd
open
up
a
whole
new
classification
of
examination,
wouldn't
we,
whether
a
particular
decision
on
the
legal
question
was
reasonable,
that
we
certainly
have
never
expressly
recognized
before?
unknown
speaker
but
the
whole
foundation,
ms.
mahoney,
for
teague
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
questions
of
law
and
questions
of
fact,
and
if
that
distinction
is
as
unworkable
as
you
suggest
then
maybe
we
should
reexamine
teague.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would,
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
if
we
just
overruled
jackson
and
go
back
to
the
old
rule.
the
old
rule
was
you
never
disturb
a
state
court
decision
if
there
was
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
support
the
verdict.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
that,
wouldn't
that
rule
satisfy
you?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well
you
would
never
disturb,
under
the
old
pre-jackson
rule
you
would
never
disturb
a
state
conviction
if
there
was
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
support
the
verdict.
unknown
speaker
that's
pretty
deferential,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
mahoney,
you
are
asking
for
a
rather
substantial
change
in
existing
law,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
four
former
attorney
generals
of
the
united
states
that
suggest
that
there
is
a
separation
of
powers
problem
here
and
that
really
your
argument
should
be
pressed
over
across
the
street
in
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
or
are
you
not
asking
us
to
change
the
law?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
goldblatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
certainly
done
that
before.
i
mean,
fay
against
noia
overruled
brown
against
allen.
we
have
subsequently
overruled
large
parts
of
fay
against...
we
have
always
felt
freer
to
move
in
this
area
of
habeas
than
we
have
in
other
statutory
questions
just
because
of
the
traditional
nature
of
the
writ,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
jackson
against
virginia
held?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
strange
definition
of
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
did.
unknown
speaker
what--
--let
me
ask
you
what
i
might
call
a
retail
rather
than
a
wholesale
question,
mr.
goldblatt,
about
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
here.
that
is,
it
said
it
was
not
holding
the
common
law
presumption
of
guilt
from
recent
possession
unconstitutional,
and
yet
under
the
common
law
presumption
it
is,
a
jury
is
charged
that
it
may
without
any
additional
evidence
find
a
defendant
guilty
on
the
base
of
the
presumption,
yet
the
court
of
appeals
sets
aside...
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
what
they're
saying
there.
i
hope
sometime
during
your
argument
you
will
address
yourself
to
that.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
that
was
just
an
instruction
as
to
the
finding
of
one
fact
in
the
case,
wasn't
it,
not
an
instruction
as
to
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
seem
that
you
are
arguing
that
the
inference
should
be
that
the
unexplained
possession
of
stolen
goods
shows
guilty
knowledge,
but
not
necessarily
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
sound
to
me
like
you're
attacking
the
validity
of
the
inference,
and
that
issue
is
procedurally
barred.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldblatt,
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether
jackson
applies
a
de
novo
standard
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
de
novo
as
to
the
fact
finder,
as
to
the
jury.
you
don't
reexamine
what
the
jury
has,
but
it
is
really
a
de
novo
standard
as
far
as
the
state
court
is
concerned,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you're
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
under
jackson
that
the
state
court
did.
you're
just
repeating
the
same,
the
same
exercise
that
the
state
court
performed.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
do
you
know
anybody
that
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
what
causes
a
particular
determination
to
be
a
general
rule
and
therefore
to
be
governed
by
teague
or
not
to
be
a
general
rule
and
therefore
not
to
be
governed
by
teague?
i
mean,
it's
always,
anything
can
be
stated
as
a
general
rule.
you
know,
the
general
rule
is
given
all
these
facts,
given
facts
of
this
sort
a
defendant
of
this
type
can
be
lawfully
convicted.
that's
a
general
rule.
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
how
general
you
have
to
get
to
be
before
teague
applies?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
this
a
general
rule,
in
this
case?
why
isn't
this
at
the
teague
level
of
generality?
unknown
speaker
or,
more
precisely,
we
would
have
said
that
teague
has
already
overruled
jackson
v.
virginia.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
this
a
general
case,
that
where
you
have
this
kind
of
a
situation,
possession
of
the
stolen
property,
it
is
lawful
to
convict
on
the,
it
is
constitutional
to
convict
on
the
basis
of
the
mere
possession
of
the
property?
that
seems
to
me
a
general
rule.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we're
going
to
have
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
figuring
out
when...
the
lower
courts
are,
and
we
will
if
we
ever
take
those
cases,
figuring
out
when
teague
applies
and
when
teague
doesn't
apply.
at
some
ineffable
level
of
generality
it
applies,
and
below
that
it
doesn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that,
said
this
kind
of
a
permissive
inference
can
never
be
drawn
from
mere
possession?
unknown
speaker
and
hence
it
would
be
a
new
rule
if
the
court
said
this
instruction
may
never
be
given?
unknown
speaker
don't
you,
as
the
chief
justice
asked
you
a
while
ago,
don't
you
think
the
court
came,
the
court
of
appeals
came
awfully
close
to
saying
that,
at
least
in
this
case,
that
the
evidence,
that
the
inference
was
not
enough,
or
the
fact
of
possession
was
not
enough
to
support
the
verdict?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
didn't
analyze
the
case
the
way
you're
now
asking
us
to
analyze
it.
it
went
very
deeply
into
the
common
law
presumption
the
fact
that
it
had
been
used
as
an
instruction.
in
fact
it
intimated,
i
believe
in
one
place
in
its
opinion,
that
it
very
likely,
if
pressed
it
would
hold
it
unconstitutional.
so
it
didn't
treat
it
just
as
if
it
were
a
red
herring
at
all.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
the
relevance
of
the
inference
was
that
the
common
law
had
deemed
when
that
inference
was
available,
had
deemed
the
evidence
to
be
sufficient.
that's
a
general
rule.
i
mean,
you,
i
guess
you
can
reduce
any
case
into
what,
you
can
call
it
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case.
i
guess
even
where
the
exclusionary
rule
applies.
i
guess
you
can
say
really
what
we
have
here
is
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case.
was
this
evidence
properly
included
or
not.
if
it
should
have
been
excluded,
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
anything
can
be
called
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
case,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but
sufficiency
under
the
common
law
as
embodied
in
the
constitution,
and
the
assertion
has
been
that
under
the
common
law
this
presumption
has
been
deemed
available
so
that
the
evidence
would
be
considered
sufficient.
and
that's
a
general
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
what
we're
discussing
now
is
a
general
rule,
whether
that
general
rule
exists
or
not.
we're
not
analyzing
evidence
anymore,
you
and
i.
we're
discussing
a
general
rule.
unknown
speaker
well
then
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
misunderstood
what
it
was
doing
in
writing
the
opinion
it
did,
if
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
a
virginia
trial
court
judge
and
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
stood,
there
were
no
opinion
from
this
court,
would
you
charge
the
jury
with
that
instruction,
with
that
inference?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the,
a
rule
being
in
effect
in
that
the
common
law
inference
had
never
been
held
unconstitutional?
isn't
that
a
form
of
rule?
unknown
speaker
but
then
would
you
say
that
miranda
was
not
a
new
decision
when
it
came
down
in
1966?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
contrary
to
the
common
law
inference
which
says
that,
in
that
charge
to
the
jury,
you
may
infer
just
from
the
fact
of
recent
possession.
so
when
you
say
in
some
cases
you
cannot
infer
it,
those
are
two
contrary
propositions.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
never
know
what
the
jury
does.
they
might
say
well,
if
it
weren't
for
this
instruction
we
would
acquit,
but
we
have
been
told
that
this
one
fact
alone
is
enough
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
that's
what
we're
going
to
rely
on.
unknown
speaker
you
think
this
instruction
meant
to
the
jury,
to
a
juror
that
this
fact
of
possession,
from
the
fact
of
possession
it
may
be
inferred
that
it's
more
reasonable
than
not
that
he
took
the
goods
himself--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
that
isn't
what
the
instructions
say.
unknown
speaker
gainey
was
a
federal
case
where
the
court
was
able
to
interpret
the
statutory
presumption
in
the
way
it
did,
but
a
federal
habeas
court
does
not
have
any
room
to
interpret
a
common
law
presumption
that
is
applied
in
the
first
instance
by
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
a
jackson
review
in
a
case
like
this
would
almost
always
require
a
court
to
say
well,
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
did.
they
may
have
relied
solely
on
the
fact
of
possession
and
the
instruction,
in
which
event
if
you,
if
you
overturned
the
conviction
based
on
jackson
you
would
be
invalidating
the
inference.
and
that's
a
new
rule.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
you
don't
know
what
the
jury
did
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
saying.
you
don't
know.
and
i
would
think
a
jackson
court
would
always
have
to
say
well,
the,
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
did.
they
may
have
relied
solely
on
the
fact
of
possession
and
the
instruction.
and
hence
our
question
is
is
that
inference,
does
the
inference
pass
muster
under
jackson.
and
if
you
say
it
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--but,
but
that
may
be
the
federal
due
process
verdict
on
the
inference,
but
the
inference
itself
is
exactly
that.
it
is
constant.
unknown
speaker
that's
where
the
inconsistency
is.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
if
we
said
teague
applies
because
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
has
invalidated
the
inference
on
constitutional
grounds
we
would,
you
would
lose
the
case.
unknown
speaker
on
the
teague
ground,
but
the
court
of
appeals
decision
then
would
stand?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
stand,
but
they
would,
the
court...
the
state
would
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
believes
that
the
inference
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
goldblatt.
mr.
curry,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
quite
say
that.
it
says
that
the
inference,
taking
into
consideration
the
whole
evidence,
is
sufficient.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
is
that
only
where
the
case
is
based
on
circumstantial
evidence?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10
o'clock.
