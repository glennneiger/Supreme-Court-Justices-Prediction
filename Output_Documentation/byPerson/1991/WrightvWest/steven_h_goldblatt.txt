mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
has
become
clear
from
the
argument
that
what
both
virginia
and
the
solicitor
general
are
asking
for
is
essentially
an
overruling
of
miller
v.
fenton,
strickland
v.
washington,
and
many,
many
decisions
coming
from
this
court
since
brown
v.
allen
that
has
required,
not
as
a
matter
of
judge-made
law
but
as
an
understanding
of
what
congress
has
required,
including
jackson
itself,
that
mixed
questions
of
law--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
don't
dispute
that
with
regard
to
several
areas
of
habeas
review,
but
with
regard
to
this
question
as
to
whether
the
fundamental
review
standard
for
the
habeas
court
is
independent
of
state
court
judgments,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
one
area
where
the
court
has
been
careful
not
to
disturb.
there
are
threshold
questions
of
whether
or
not
you
are
allowed
to
bring
the
writ,
whether
you
are
entitled
to
relief,
whether
you
have
defaulted
the
issue,
whether
you
have
abused
the
writ,
and
things
like
that,
but
as
the
questions
became
clear
the
review
that
the
federal
habeas
court
conducts
is
independent
review,
and
the
understanding
is
that
that
was
required
by
congress.
that
is
what
jackson
v.
virginia
held.
the
court
didn't
simply
devise
that
standard
based
on
its
own
view
of
what--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--jackson
v.
virginia
holds
that
the
federal
habeas
court
must
conduct
its
own
independent
review
of
whether
any
rational
juror
could
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
based
on
the
state
court,
state's
definition
of
the
elements
of
its
crimes.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
would
describe
it
as
it's
independent
review
by
the
federal
court
under
a
highly
deferential
standard.
but
in
fact
it
did
change
the
prior
standard
which
was
thompson
v.
louisville--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--which
was
any
scintilla
of
evidence.
so
in
that
sense...
but
it
is
independent
review.
i
think
what
has
happened
is
there
has
been
a
confusion
over
whether
or
not
the
federal
habeas
court
must
accept
the
state
court
determination
because
it's
reasonable,
which
i
don't
think
is
the
correct
question.
the
question
for
this
court,
i
think
at
this
point
in
reviewing
the
fourth
circuit,
is
whether
its
determination
under
jackson
v.
virginia
was
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
let
me
address
it
now,
because
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that,
partially
in
the
answer
that
my
opponent
gave
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
i
don't
think
the
instruction
is
relevant
here.
i
think
it's
a
red
herring
in
many
ways.
and
when
they
indicated
that
if
no
instruction
was
given
at
all
the
sufficiency
issue
would
be
there,
that's
the
issue
we
have
always
raised.
my
understanding
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
gainey,
the
court
recognized
there
that
even
if
you
have
an
instruction
that
tells
the
jury
that
a
certain
quantum
evidence
is
legally
sufficient,
that
doesn't
alter
the
power
of
the
court
to
rule
on
a
motion
jnov
or
even
to
reverse
on
appeal
on
the
basis
that
the
evidence
was
not
adequate
to
let
the
jury
decide
the
case
that
way.
i
think
there
are
two
different
questions.
i
think
if
no
instruction
had
been
given
here
at
all
and
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty,
they
would
be
arguing
that
there
is
an
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
he
was
in
possession
of
these
goods
and
that
that
was
enough
to
convict
this
person
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
we
would
be
arguing
the
same
things
we
have
been
arguing
all
along.
i
don't
think
this
is
an
instruction
case.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
partially,
and
again
to
avoid
the
problem
of
announcing
a
new
rule
here,
my
authority
for
that
is
ulster
county
court
v.
allen,
which
was
decided
i
believe
2
weeks
before
jackson
v.
virginia,
that
recognized
that
the
instruction,
an
instruction
like
this
may
be
given
under
a
more
likely
than
not
standard.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
believe
that
was
a
finding
that
you
could
infer
knowledge
of
possession
of
the
gun
from
anyone
who
was
an
occupant
of
the
car.
i
think
it's
the
same
type
of
permissive
inference
that
was
used
here.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
real
distinction
to
be
drawn.
or
the
same
with
the
gainey
inference,
which
was
anybody
who
was
in
the,
at
a
still
was
presumed
or
inferred
under
the
policy
that
is
used
now
to
be
part
of
that
operation
was
guilty.
and
i
really
think
that
that
is
critical
to
the
understanding
of
our
case
because
this
is
not
a
case
that
challenges
the
inference
directly.
it
never
was.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
o'connor,
the
inference,
there
are
two
inferences
that
arise,
they
were
both
recognized
in
common
law.
one
is
that
the
possessor
obtain
the
goods
as
the
thief,
the
person
who
took
them
from
the
owner.
the
other,
more
widely
recognized
and
i
think
in
most
of
the
authorities
considered
stronger,
is
that
the
person
who
has
possession
of
those
stolen
goods
knew
them
to
be
stolen
when
they
gained
possession
of
them.
the
difference
between
the
two
is,
in
the
complaint
that
we
have
here
is
not
only
did
virginia
ask
the
jury
to
draw
from
his
possession
the
fact
that
he
came
by
the
goods
unlawfully,
but
that
he
at
least
2
weeks
earlier
was
at
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time
and
took
them
in
a
certain
way.
in
virginia
they
would
use
this
inference,
since
they
could
reasonably
show
that
the
theft
took
place
at
the
same
time
as
the
burglary,
to
convict
of
burglary
or
robbery
or
what
have
you.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
no,
i
would
submit
that
where
we
are
attacking
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
gives
rise
to
whatever
inferences
may
exist
in
this
case,
whether
they
exist
in
common
law
or
not.
we're
saying
that
whatever
inference
there
is
in
this
case
that
he
is
the
thief
is
not
adequate
to
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
we
would
be
making
that
argument
if
no
instruction
had
been
given
at
all.
it
is
essentially
the
same
issue.
the
fact
that
virginia
recognizes
a
common
law
inference
does
not
bind
the
federal
court
in
determining
whether
the
proof
meets
the
requisite
standard.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
critical
distinction
for
purposes
of
a
teague
analysis,
because
again
in
ulster
county
court
the
court
had
recognized
the
distinction
between
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
inference
and
the
giving
of
the
instruction
and
the
separate
question
of
whether
or
not
the
crime
had
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
would
agree.
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
not
necessarily.
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
state
court
would
use
the
any
rational
juror
standard.
they
could
use
a
different...
they
are
not
bound
to
use,
that's
the
fun
of
due
process
standard.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
it's
not
altogether
clear
and
it
wasn't
altogether
clear
when
jackson
was
decided
whether
virginia
does.
we
would
submit
in
this
case
that
there
was,
it's
hard
to
tell
what
analysis
they
used
here
at
all.
we
would
submit
that
their
analysis
is
not
the
same,
that
this
court
would
understand
where
this
inference
is
operating
is
required
by
due
process.
so
i
think
there
is
a
difference
in
the
legal
standard.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
well,
i
think
there
are
levels
of
abstraction
that
you
have
to
deal
with.
there
would
be
the
due
process
standard
which
would
be
the
most
abstract.
i
think
jackson
is
one
step
removed
from
that.
it
was
a
refinement
of
the
thompson
v.
louisville
standard.
and
i
think
that
even
if
you're
dealing
with
the
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
where
you're
dealing
with
an
abstract
principle,
there
is
still
room
for
determination
of
whether
or
not
you're
applying
a
new
rule.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
think
it's
at
the
teague
level
of
generality
because
there
is
more
specificity.
i
think,
as
the
fourth
circuit
correctly
held,
if
you
were
to
say
that
each
time
a
court
does
a
jackson
v.
virginia
analysis
of
the
new
set
of
facts
that
a
new
rule
emerges
from
that,
you
have
overruled
jackson
v.
virginia.
there
could
be
no
sufficiency
analysis.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
or
you
could
say
that.
but
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
teague,
which
doesn't
discuss
any
of
the
standard
of
review
cases.
it
would
likely
overrule
miller
v.
fenton,
strickland
v.
washington,
and
any
other
abstract
rule
case,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
it
was
designed
to
do.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
scalia,
i
can
find
no
such
general
rule
in
federal
jurisprudence.
what
i
can
find
is
ulster
county
court
v.
allen,
which
recognizes
the
existence
of
common
law
inferences,
or,
and
statutory
inferences,
and
suggests
that
in
each
case
you
have
to
look
at
some
point
at
the
underlying
facts
giving
rise
to
the
inference
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
was
decided
before
this
case
was
finalized
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
don't
think
so.
it's
more
a
question,
in
my
view,
as
to
what
was
teague
designed
to
do.
teague,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
rule
of
retroactivity
that
adopted
in
large
part
the
justice
harlan
view
in
mackey
that
on
collateral
review
you
apply
the
law,
the
federal
habeas
court
applies
the
settled
law
as
it
can
independently
and
objectively
determine
that
law
to
be
in
existence
at
the
time
the
case
was
decided
in
the
state
courts.
we
ask
for
application
of
jackson
v.
virginia
and
ulster
county
court,
both
of
which
were
in
existence
at
the
time.
the
most
i
can
see
in
the
language
of
the
court
that
would
deal,
when
you're
dealing
in
the
more
abstract,
would
be
the
language
in
stringer
which
was
decided
a
few
weeks
ago
where
the
court
said
if
you're
in
an
application
situation
if
the
habeas
court
is
going
to
apply
an
established
rule
in
a
novel
setting
and
thereby
extend
the
precedent,
then
you
have
a
teague
bond.
what
i
submit
here
and
what
we
have
been
arguing
all
along
is
that
that
is
not
the
case
here.
this
is
a
straightforward
sufficiency
case.
there
was
no
rule
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
was
litigated
as
a
matter
of
federal
due
process
law.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
i
would
submit...
if
they
drew
that,
that
rule,
if
they
said
that,
an
absolute
rule
that
this
evidence
standing
alone
can
never
be
sufficient,
that
would
be
a
new
rule.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that
would
be
a
new
rule
as
well.
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
federal
law
before
that...
the
rule
before
that
would
be
that
the
instruction
may
be
given
as
long
as
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
ultimate
inference
flows
from
the
basic
facts.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
in
this
case,
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
fact
intensive
of
when
he
was
in
possession
of
the
goods,
how
much
of
the
total
goods
taken
were
in
his
possession,
what
was
the
nature
of
the
goods,
what
other
evidence
was
presented
in
the
case,
it's
fact
intensive.
the
court
if
anything
went
out
of
its
way
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
suggesting
a
general
rule
in
virginia
or
anywhere
that
the
inference
could
not
be,
continue
to
be
used.
it
assumed
that
it
would
continue
to
be
used.
what
makes
this
case
unusual,
it's
one
of
the
few
cases
that
we
or
the
other
side
has
been
able
to
find
where
the
prosecution
relied
on
the
inference
so
strongly.
but
ultimately
the
inference
is
irrelevant.
the
question
is
whether
west's
possession
of
these
goods
2
weeks
after
the
theft
is
enough
evidence
to
prove
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
crime.
that
is
classic
sufficiency
review.
the
inference,
whether
it
operates
or
not,
is--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--mr.
chief
justice,
admittedly
that
language
is
there.
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
say
that
language
is
not
there.
i
don't
think
it's
central
to
its
decision,
and
in
fact
in
deciding
what
issue
it
was
reviewing
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
issue
we
were
raising
was
that
the
evidence
was
inadequate
under
whatever
instructions
the
court
might
give.
so
whatever
language
is
in
there,
ultimately
it
is
a
fact
intensive
review
based
on
the
facts
of
our
case
and
a
disclaimer
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
that
the
court
was
making
any
ruling
on
the
inference
itself.
we
do
the
same--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
would
submit
not.
i
would
submit
that
this
case,
if
you
look
at
this
record
from
the
beginning,
from
the,
when
it
was
tried
in
virginia,
it
has
always
been
a
sufficiency
case.
this
hasn't
been
dressed
up
in
a
new
way
to
avoid
teague.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
but
i
don't
think
that
is
the
general
rule.
the
general
rule
as
a
matter
of
federal
due
process
law
since
ulster
county
court
v.
allen
was
that
where
these
inferences
are
created
either
by
statute
or
existent
common
law,
there
is
a
duty
upon
the
part
of
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
underlying
facts
that
give
rise
to
the
inference
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
elements
analysis
that
this
court
has
developed
for
the
due
process
standpoint
dates
from
in
re
winship.
the
common
law
inference
goes
back
to
trial
by
combat.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
only
issue
that
was
properly
before
the
circuit
in
which
it
decided
is
discussing
evidence,
the
evidence
that
the
state
introduced
to
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime.
the
existence
of
an
inference
and
what
strength
it
had
in
common
law
is
not
the
relevant
inquiry
in
order
to
decide
this
case
under
established
constitutional
principles.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
based
on
its
reliance
on
the
cosby
v.
jones
case
decided
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
i
would
submit
that
although
there
is
language
in
there,
this
broad
language
regarding
the
strength
of
the
inference,
that
is
not
central
to
the
actual
decision
in
the
case.
this
case
comes
down
to
a
question
of
whether
his
possession
of
these
goods
2
weeks
after
they
were
taken
somewhere
else
in
virginia
establishes
guilt
of
the
crime
charged.
that
is
classical
jackson
analysis.
and
the
minute
they
say
that
this
case
is
different
if
the
instruction
was
not
given,
that's
proper
jackson
v.
virginia
review,
i
submit
it's
the
same
question
we've
been
raising
all
along.
it's
not
a
challenge
to
the
instruction.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
would
guide
the
virginia
courts
in
reading
federal
law
would
be
ulster
county
court,
is
it
more
likely
than
not
that
the
inference
flows
from
the
underlying
inference,
from
the
underlying
facts.
that's
the
same
as
it
has
always
been
even
when
this
case
was
decided
in
the
virginia
courts.
it's
a
very
rare
case
where
the
only
evidence
that
the
state
presents
is
whatever
evidence
gives
rise
to
the
inference.
there,
that
is
why
these
cases
rarely
arise
in
the
federal
system
under
habeas
review
and
why
they
can
cite
so
few
cases.
it's
an
unusual,
rare
circumstance,
but
it's
a
sufficiency
issue.
do
they
have
enough
evidence
to
convict
of
the
crime
that
they
have
charged
for?
the
instructions
that
the
court
gives
is
not
the
issue
that
we
are
raising.
there
was
no
general
rule
that
existed
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
in
the
state
courts
that
said
this
inference,
no
matter
how
weak
it
is,
will
always
prove
theft.
if
such
a
rule
existed
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
we
would
have
a
teague
problem.
indeed
if
jackson
was
decided
let's
say
a
year
later
than
it
was,
we'd
be
reviewing
this
case
under
the
thompson
v.
louisville
standard.
we
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
jackson.
but
if
the
court
agrees
that
there
was
no
rule
in
effect
at
the
time
that
this
inference
was
necessarily
sufficient
to
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--i
don't
believe
so
in
light
of
the--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--it
certainly
was
a
new
decision.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
i
don't
think
there
is
a
rule
here
that
the
common
law
inference
is
unconstitutional.
there's
a
ruling
here
that
the
evidence
presented
was
not
sufficient
to
convict
him
of
the
crime
charged.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
i'm
drawing
from
gainey,
that
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one,
you
may
instruct
the
jury
that
you
have
this
permissive
inference,
you
may
infer
from
the
possession
of
these
goods
that
the
person
is
the
thief
does
not
foreclose
later
review
by
a
court
on
a
legal
question
of
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
convict.
there
are
two--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that
may
well
happen,
justice
white.
the
point
i'm
raising
is
the
safeguard
in
that
situation,
especially
since
this
court
has
upheld
as
a
matter
of
due
process
the
giving
of
this
type
of
instruction
not
on
the
basis
that
it
proves
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
on
the
basis
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not.
that
the
safeguard
is
straightforward
sufficiency
review
after
the
case
is
over
to
insure
that
each
element
of
the
crime
has
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
otherwise
the
standard
for
giving
the
instruction
in
the
first
place
would
have
to
be
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
which
the
court
rejected
because
there
is
other
evidence
in
the
case
that
has
to
be
evaluated.
and
united
states
v.
gainey,
which
is
obviously
not
a
habeas
case
but
a
federal
case,
recognized
that
even
when
a
statute
says
that
the
inference
is
sufficient
to
convict
does
not
foreclose--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--no,
it
doesn't.
but
the
due
process
question
of
whether
the
instruction
may
be
given
or
not
is
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not,
with
the
test
of
whether
the
conviction
was
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
based
on
a
review
of
the
entire
record
including
the
evidence
giving
rise
to
the
inference
and
anything
else
that
was
presented.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
here
i
don't
think
that
the
common
law
inference
is
part
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
virginia.
rather
in
this
case
they
held
that
the
common
law
inference
was
enough
to
convict
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that's
the
ultimate
question
under
jackson,
which
i
would
submit
has
to
be
decided
independently
under
federal
law.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
justice
white,
in
this
case
i
don't
think
it
is
a
new
rule.
i
don't
think
there
was
a
rule
in
effect--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--that
i
would
submit
is
true
in
any
case
when
you
do
a
jackson
analysis.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
in
this
particular
case.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
rule
that
can
be
pointed
to
that
existed
at
the
time
this
case
was
litigated
as
a
matter
of
federal
due
process
law
that,
in
inference
like
this,
can
be
judged
in
the
abstract.
it
has
to
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
facts
that
are
presented.
the
inference
is
not
constant.
it
can
be
weak
or
it
can
be
strong.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
i
would
submit--
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
argue
that
whatever
the
state
law
is
on
the
constancy
of
the
inference,
whatever
they
determine
to
be
as
a
matter
of
state
law
adequate
evidence
to
prove
each
element
of
the
crime,
does
not
control
the
federal
independent
determination
of
whether
the
elements
as
defined
by
the
state
have
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that's
what
jackson
v.
virginia
decided
you
needed
independent
federal
review
for,
and
that's
what
i
would
submit
is
not
a
question
of
state
law
but
is
a
matter
of
federal
jackson
law,
which
is
not
bound
by
the
state.
it
doesn't
constitute
a
new
rule.
there
was
no
rule
in
effect
in
the
federal
system
that
any
common
law
inference
or
statutory
inference
in
and
of
itself
was
necessarily
sufficient
to
prove
guilt
without
looking
to
the
facts
of
your
case
to
see
what
evidence
gave
rise
to
the
inference.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
on
the
teague
grounds,
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
well,
i
don't
think
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
wouldn't
stand
if
it
was
determined
to
be
a
new
rule
and
therefore
teague-barred.
mr.
steven
h.
goldblatt
yes,
subject
only
to
the
qualification
that
i
truly
believe
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
is
that
they
were
invalidating
the
conviction
in
this
case.
they
were
not
invalidating
the
inference.
that
is
what
they
say
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
when
they
talk
in
terms
of
the
inference
not
being
as
strong
as
it
was,
they're
referring
to
comments
including
lord
hale,
some
several
hundred
years
ago,
as
to
the
strength
of
the
inference
dissipating.
it
wasn't
something
that
happened
in
the
last
10
years
or
so.
they
went
into
a
historical
analysis
that
itself
challenges
the
ability
of
this
inference
particularly
to
distinguish
how
someone
came
into
possession
of
the
goods,
which
is
the
way
it
was
used
here.
ultimately
i
think
the
two
issues
that
are
correctly
before
the
court
are,
one,
is
the
decision
by
the
fourth
circuit
not
reasonable
but
is
it
correct
application
of
law,
and
two,
whether
or
not
it
announced
a
new
rule
by
application
of
jackson,
which
of
course
if
it
did
it
would
be
teague-barred.
those
are
the
questions
that
i
think
that
are
properly
before
the
court.
we
submit
that
this
isn't
a
novel
application
of
jackson
v.
virginia,
and
that
no
precedent
was
extended
by
virtue
of
the
decision,
and
any
language
in
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
that
is
read
otherwise
is
dicta
and
was
not
central
to
any
decision
that
it
reached.
that
was
the
whole
battle
we
went
through
below,
was
are
we
attacking
the
inference
or
not.
and
then
there
was
briefing
and
rebriefing
of
that
issue
because
i
think
the
court
recognized
it
couldn't
announce
a
new
rule
that
the
inference
was
not
valid
and
could
not
be
used
in
virginia
except
for
purposes
of
how
it
was
used
in
this
particular
case
as
a
matter
of
evidential
sufficiency.
and
finally
i
would
simply
suggest
that
those
i
think
are
the
proper
issues
that
are
before
the
court.
the
question
of
standard
of
review
is
not
a
teague
question.
standard
of
review
cases
are
not
even
discussed
in
teague.
mixed
law,
fact
and
law
questions
are
subject
to
teague
in
the
sense
that
i
have
just
described.
if
this
is
an
extension
of
jackson,
as
this
court
has
defined
it,
then
it
is
teague-barred.
but
to
suggest
that
all
mixed
questions
and
all
state
court
decisions
that
are
reasonable,
quote,
unquote,
must
be
upheld
by
the
federal
habeas
court
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
understanding
of
the
statute,
overrules
cases
that
are
not
even
mentioned
in
teague,
and
is
ultimately
a
question,
as
has
been
addressed
in
many
of
the
amici
briefs,
for
congress
to
decide.
whether
there
is
independent
review
or
not
is
a
congressional
decision
because
of
the
weighing
of
so
many
different
factors
as
to
whether
or
not
we
need
federal
habeas
review.
i
would
submit
that
it
has
been
the
court's
understanding
since
1953
that
this
is
a
question
that
has
already
been
decided
by
congress.
this
case
is
not
affected
by
that
line
of
authority
at
all.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
