ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
teague
does
not
itself
mandate
an
application
of
a
deferential
standard
of
review
to
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact,
that
instead
it
and
its
progeny
seem
to
suggest
that
settled
questions
of
law
can
be
applied
to
the
facts,
and
it
has
not
yet
changed
the
standard
of
review
that
would
govern
those
determinations
by
the
state
courts.
what
we
ask
this
court
to
do,
however,
is
to
reevaluate
whether
that
standard
of
review
in
fact
conforms
to
the
purposes
of
the
writ,
because
for
the
last
16
years
in
a
series
of
decisions
starting
with
wainwright
v.
sykes,
francis
v.
henderson,
and
all
the
way
through
coleman
v.
thompson,
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
when
looking
at
rules
governing
the
scope
of
the
writ
we
need
to
weigh
the
costs
in
terms
of
finality
and
comity
against
the
benefits.
and
those
benefits
are
generally
viewed
in
terms
of
whether
they
are
necessary,
whether
the
rule
is
necessary
to
advance
the
fundamental
deterrent
and
remedial
purposes
of
the
writ.
we
submit
that,
for
the
same
kinds
of
reasons
that
led
the
court
in
teague
and
butler
to
change
the
standard
of
review
in
effect
that
is
applicable
to
state
determinations
of
questions
of
law,
this
court
should
also
now
find
that
it
is
appropriate
to
use
a
deferential
standard
of
review
for
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
we
contend
that
jackson
v.
virginia
is
wrong.
not
the
underlying
substantive
standard
about--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is
deferential,
and
the
underlying--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
it
is
not.
the
substantive
standard
of
due
process
viewing
the
jury
verdict
we
think
is
absolutely
right,
whether
any
rational
jury
could
find
guilt.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
instead
the
habeas
court
should
ask
whether
the
state
court's
rejection
of
the
jackson
claim
was
reasonable,
because
as
this
court
found,
as
the
lower
court
found...
excuse
me?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
there
is
not
a
great
difference,
but
the
real
difference
is
that
for
jackson,
jackson
says
that
the
federal
habeas
court
should
look
to
what
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
done.
what
we
say
is
that
the
federal
habeas
court
should
look
to
whether
the
state
judge's
determination
of
the
question
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
and
that
that
standard
should
be
applied
for
all
determinations--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that
is
our
point.
the
state
courts--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
the
federal
courts
should
determine
whether
their
judgment
was
reasonable.
if
it
was
reasonable--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--excuse
me?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
whether
it
is
reasonable?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
that
the
fourth
circuit,
if
asked
that
question,
would
have
found
that
the
judgment
of
the
virginia
court
was
reasonable.
the
refer
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
judgment
call
as
to
whether
a
rational
fact
finder
could
have
reached
one
result
or
the
other.
and
i
think
that
had
they
been
applying
a
deferential
standard
of
review
this
case
in
fact
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
proving
the
point
that
even
in
the
jackson
context
the
standard
of
review
that
we
seek
can
make
a
difference.
the
critical
point
here
is
that
there
is
just
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
federal
courts
on
de
novo
review
are
more
likely
to
get
the
answer
right--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
review
of
the
state
court's
determination
of
the
jackson
claim
is
de
novo.
i
understand
your
point.
this
is
somewhat
more
complicated
in
the
jackson
context
than
it
would
be
in
other
areas
of
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law,
such
as
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
a
number
of
the
other
areas,
voluntariness
of
confessions,
where
you
wouldn't
get
the
extra
layer
of
deference.
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
if
the
state
court's
determination
of
the
constitutional
question
is
reasonable,
this
court,
the
federal
court
should
defer
to
that
judgment
because
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
that's
a
deferential
standard
of
review.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
this
court
has
not
expressly
recognized
it,
but
this
i
think
is
a
way
to
avoid
the
problems
that
the
fourth
circuit
discussed
in
the
case
about
how
to
determine
whether
you
are
into
the
ealm
of
a
new
rule
or
whether
you
are
simply
applying
settled
law
to
facts.
these
distinctions
are
very
difficult
to
draw,
and
by
adopting
the
rule
that
we
are
proposing
it,
those
distinctions
would
not
become
as
difficult
or
as
important.
moreover--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
underlying
rationale
of
teague
very
much
supports
the
rule
of
deference
for
mixed
questions
as
well.
i
know
of
no
area
of
the
law
where
greater
deference
is
shown
to
interpretations
of
law
than
it
is
to
interpretations
of
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
in
fact
under
this
court's
precedents
there
are
a
number
of
areas
of
the
law
where
it
is
exactly
the
reverse,
where
greater
deference
is
shown
to
the
application
of
law
to
fact
for
mixed
questions
than
for
the
determinations
of
the
legal
issue.
this
court's
willingness
to
defer
to
reasonable
interpretations
in
the
legal
area
i
think
compels
logically
the
conclusion
that
the
same
kind
of
deference
should
be
applied
to
the
state
court
application
of
law
to
fact.
and
in
fact
if
we
look
at
recent
experience
in
a
number
of
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
in
the
last
few
years
where
the
lower
courts
had
issued
the
writ
because
they
found
on
de
novo
review
that
the
state
court's
application
of
law
to
fact
was
wrong,
this
court
reversed.
that
happened
in
estelle
v.
mcguire,
it
happened
in
duckworth
v.
eagan.
after
years
and
years
of
litigation
on
habeas
this
court
found
ultimately
that
the
state
court
was
right
and
the
federal
court
was
wrong.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
our
concerns
go
far
beyond
jackson.
the
rule
that
we
are--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the...
we
don't
have
any--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because
we
think
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
court
to
conduct
review
of
state
court
determinations
to
insure
that
they
are
reasonable,
to
insure
that
they
are
conducted
in
accordance
with
fair
process.
that
is
the
traditional
role
of
the
writ.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but,
your
honor,
we
don't
think--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
we
don't,
we're
not
asking
for
total
deference.
we
don't
think
that
the
rule
should
be
that
state
court
determinations
should
never
be
disturbed.
we
think
that
instead
the
rule
has
to
be
tailored
to
insure
that
there
is
fair
process
and
reasoned
decision
making,
and
that
is
the
thrust
of
all
of
this
court's
adjudication
in
the
areas
of
rules--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
we
are,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statute
that
dictates
a
de
novo
standard
of
review
for
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact,
and
in
fact
we
submit
that
the
language
clearly
suggests
otherwise.
it
provides
that
the
writs
are
to
be
disposed
of--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--asking
you
to
change
this
court's
precedence.
we
are
not
asking
you
to
change
the
statute.
the
statute
gives
you
the
equitable
power
to
devise
rules
that
are
appropriate
in
light
of
comity
and
federalism
in
order
to
preserve
finality
while
still
insuring
that
the
writ
can
serve
its
traditional
purpose
of
preventing
fundamental
unfairness.
and,
your
honor,
the
statute
specifically
says
that
the
writ
shall
issue
as
law
and
justice
requires.
and
this
court
has
for
years
found
that
the
rules
governing
the
scope
of
the
writ
are
to
be
designed
by
this
court,
and
in
a
series
of
cases
over
the
last
16
years
has
displaced
prior
rules
that
were
based
upon...
thank
you.
