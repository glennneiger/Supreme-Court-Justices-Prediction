justice
clarence
thomas
in
the
first
case,
i
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
to
announce,
wright
v.
west,
91-542.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
respondent,
frank
west,
was
convicted
of
grand
larceny
in
a
virginia
trial
court.
on
direct
and
state
collateral
review,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
rejected
west's
claim
that
the
evidence
introduced
at
trial
was
insufficient
to
support
his
conviction.
west
then
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
which
also
rejected
west's
sufficiency
challenge.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
applying
our
decision
in
jackson
versus
virginia,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
recognized
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
a
criminal
conviction
if
after
reviewing
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution
any
rational
trial
or
fact
could
have
found
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
in
this
case,
the
jackson
standard
was
not
met.
we
unanimously
reverse.
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
i
conclude
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
west's
conviction
regardless
of
whether
the
state
court
determination
of
that
question
should
be
reviewed
deferentially
or
de
novo
on
federal
habeas.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
have
joined;
justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter
also
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
