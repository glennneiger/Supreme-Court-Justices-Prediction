mr.
donald
r.
curry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
this
case
is
all
about
is
whether
this
court
meant
what
it
said
in
teague
v.
lane
and
its
progeny
about
having
confidence
in
the
state
courts
to
faithfully
follow
the
constitution
and
about
federal
habeas
courts
deferring
to
reasonable
good
faith
state
court
judgments.
west
and
his
amici
complain
that
we
are
trying
to
take
the
federal
courts
out
of
the
formula
by
which
habeas
corpus
cases
are
decided.
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
rule
of
preclusion.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
the
court
make
explicitly
clear
that
the
state
courts
are
an
important
part
of
that
calculus
too,
and
that
federal
habeas
courts
are
not
free
to
decide
the
cases
of
state
prisoners
as
if
the
state
court
decision
had
never
even
occurred.
in
a
system
where
congress
has
expressly
required
that
a
state
prisoner
first
take
his
constitutional
claims
to
state
court
before
bringing
them
to
federal
court,
it
makes
absolutely
no
sense
to
then
turn
around
on
federal
habeas
corpus
and
completely
disregard
the
state
court
decision.
the
problem
that
exists
is
that
federal
collateral
relief,
with
all
of
the
systemic
costs
that
this
court
has
identified,
is
still
being
granted
not
because
the
state
court
decision
was
indefensible,
not
because
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
under
existing
precedent,
but
simply
because
a
federal
habeas
court
thinks
in
its
opinion
that
its
decision
is
right
and
that
the
decisions
of
all
the
state
courts
that
went
before
were
wrong.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
of
course,
justice
souter,
that's
exactly
what
we
are
arguing,
and
that's
exactly
the
question
that
we
raised
in
the
court
below.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
it's
certainly
true,
justice
souter,
that
we
should
win
under
a
correct
application
of
teague.
but
the
point
of
this
case
as
we
see
it
at
this
juncture
in
view
of
the
court's
question
that
it
asked
when
certiorari
was
granted
is
whether
teague
in
effect
has
taken
the
jackson
standard,
which
is
a
very
deferential
standard,
and
in
effect
applied
it
across
the
board
and
made
it
the
standard
of
review.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
certainly.
and
i
think
it
is,
the
common
law
inference
is
just
a
recognition
of
what
is
common
sense.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
justice
kennedy,
we
have
never,
we
have
never
contended
that
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claims
are
not
reviewable
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no,
we're
not,
we're
not
challenging
whether
the
federal
habeas
court
had
jurisdiction.
we
contended
below
that
we
should
win
under
a
straight
out
application
of
jackson,
and
we
should
win
under
a
straight
out
application
of
jackson.
we
are
contending
that--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
it
is
appropriate
under
teague
and
jackson
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
court
looks
at
whether
the
decision
reached
by
the
decision-maker
is
one
that
a
reasonable
decision-maker
could
have
made.
and
that
is
the
inquiry
under
jackson.
it
is
also
the
inquiry
under
teague.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
i
don't
think
that's
what
teague
means.
and
i
think
what
the
court
just
said
a
few
weeks
ago
in
stringer
makes
that
point.
the
court
said
in
stringer
that
the
teague
doctrine,
the
interest
of
federalism
underlying
that
doctrine,
are
equally
undermined
when
you
apply
a
new
rule,
in
other
words
apply
an
after-decided
case,
and
it
is
equally
undermined
when
you
take
settled
law
and
apply
it
in
a
way
that
is
not
dictated
by
precedent.
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
contending
should
have
been
the
standard
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
i
agree
that
there
are
situations
where
you
take
a
settled
principle
and
you
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
a
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference
for
purposes
of
the
teague
inquiry.
after
all,
in
butler
v.
mckellar
he,
the
petitioner
in
that
case,
the
prisoner
in
that
case
first
said
that
he
was
relying
on
the
roberson
decision
which
was
an
after-decided
case.
and
when
clearly
he
could
not
do
that
under
teague,
his
answer
to
that
was
all
i
am
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
take
edwards
v.
arizona
and
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
my
case,
and
i
should
win.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
that
question
would
be
answered
by
applying
the
teague
test.
if
it's,
if
the
fact
situation
is
close
enough,
then
the
result
was
dictated
by
precedent.
if
the
fact
situation
is
not
close
enough,
then
it
was
not
dictated
by
precedent.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well
maybe,
i
see
it
a
little
bit
differently,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
way
i
see
it
is
that
when
you,
if
you
say
that
the
result
was
not
dictated
by
precedent,
then
by
definition
under
the
teague
standard
the
result
that
the
state
court
reached
was
not
reasonable
under
existing
precedent.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
we
should
win
under
teague,
but
i
don't
really
see
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
jackson
standard
and
the
teague
standard.
it
think
it's
impossible
that
a
federal
habeas
court--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
let
me
just
explain
why
i
say
that.
i
think
if
a
federal
habeas
court
decided
the
case
under
jackson
and
found
that
no
rational
jury
could
have
reached
this
conclusion,
it
is
simply
impossible
to
say
that
the
same
federal
court
would
look
at
it
under
teague
and
say
well,
even
though
the
jury
acted
irrationally
i
have
to
find
that
a
reasonable
state
court
could
have
affirmed
that
irrational
verdict.
our
point
is
that
they
are
both
very
deferential
standards.
i
think
it
is
completely
a
mistake
to
look
at
jackson
as
a
de
novo
standard.
i
think
that
point
was
made
clear
by
the
court
in
lewis
v.
jeffers.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right,
but,
that's
part
of
our
point.
in
view
of
teague...
jackson
itself
talks
about
the
state
appellate
court's
decision.
in
no
fewer
than
three
places
in
jackson
it
talks
about
the
state
court
appellate
decision
and
says
at
one
point
of
course
it's
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
and
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--well,
justice
white,
as
i
said
before,
we
have
always
contended
that
we
should
win
under
jackson.
we
contend
that
today.
but
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
on
the
teague
issue
because
we
think
the
point
of
teague
is
that
it
basically
takes
a
standard
very
much
like
jackson
and
applies
it
across
the
board.
and
the
court
asked
the
question
that
asked
about
it
in
terms
of
the
standard
of
review,
and
we
think
that
teague
provides
that
standard
of
review.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
no.
certainly
not.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
yes,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
analyzed
differently
in
terms
of
teague,
because
jackson,
although
it
talks
about
the
state
appellate
court's
decision
and
it
has
to
be
given
deference,
it
doesn't
articulate
what
that
deference
is,
and
it
talks
more
in
terms
of
the
federal
court
looking
directly
at
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
i
think
it's
really
more
a
question
of
modifying
the
way
that
it
has
been
applied.
it
is
commonly
applied
as
if
the
state
court
decision
had
never
even
occurred,
when
jackson
itself
says
that
the
state
court
appellate
decision
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--teague--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--yes.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
well,
that
is
certainly
my
answer
to
the
question,
but
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--i
think
the
court
itself
has
expanded
teague,
because
when
you
say
in
teague
that
a
prisoner
cannot
take
advantage
of
a
case
that
was
decided
after
his
case
became
final,
state
prisoners
immediately
come
to
the
federal
court
and
say
i
don't
want
the
benefit
of
that
case.
i
want
the
benefit
of
this
preexisting
case
applied
to
the
facts
of
my
case.
that
is
the
situation
that
the
court
has
been
confronted
with
from
butler
v.
mckellar
on.
and
the
court
has
answered
that
question
not
by
saying
well,
since
you're
not
asking
for
the
benefit
of
an
after-decided
case,
fine,
we'll
just
go
ahead
with
de
novo
review.
what
the
court
has
said
is
let's
look
at
the
preexisting
case
and
see
if
it
dictates
the
result
that
you
want.
and
the
way
you
define
whether
it
is
dictated
is
was
the
result
one
that
a
reasonable
court
could
have
reached
under
existing
precedent.
the
fundamental
underlying
premise
of
the
view
that
insists
upon
de
novo
review
in
federal
collateral
proceedings
is
basically
a
distrust
of
state
courts.
in
other
words
these
matters
are
just
too
important
and
we
cannot
trust
state
court
judges
to
faithfully
follow
the
constitution
and
to
apply
constitutional
principles
to
the
facts
of
a
given
case.
that
is
a
premise
that
we
unequivocally
reject.
more
importantly,
it
is
a
premise
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
and
emphatically
rejected.
and
while
the
court
knows,
just
like
i
know,
that
state
courts
don't
blindly
follow
every
time
a
lower
federal
court
finds
or
announces
a
constitutional
principle,
the
court
also
knows
that
the
state
courts
do
pay
close
attention
when
this
court
speaks,
and
that
they
do
their
level
best
to
faithfully
follow
the
constitution
and
to
apply
constitutional
principles
as
this
court
directs
them
to
do.
and
what
this
case
all
boils
down
to
is
how
much
does
this
court
trust
the
state
courts,
and
whether
this
court
has
meant
it
in
the
past
when
it
has
said
that
it
does
have
that
confidence
in
the
state
courts.
at
this
point
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
yield
to
the
solicitor
general
and
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
just
like
to
make
three
or
four
brief
points.
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
about
what
i
said
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
what
i
meant
to
say
and
what
i
think
i
said
was
the
fact
that
the
instruction
was
given
doesn't
mean
that
the
jury
couldn't
have
drawn
the
inference
in
the
absence
of
the
instruction.
but
i
think
it's
important
that
the
instruction
was
given
here
because
the
instruction,
this
was
not,
this
is
not
a
common
law
inference
that
allows
you
to
infer
an
element
of
the
offense.
this
is
an
instruction
that
allows
you
to
infer
guilt.
it
says
you
can
infer
theft
from
these
facts.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right.
and
the
evidence
here,
of
course,
was
that,
the
fourth
circuit
admitted
that
the
basic
facts
were
there
to
properly
instruct
the
jury
as
to
recent
possession--
mr.
donald
r.
curry
--plus
he
falsely
testified
about
his
involvement.
but
i
think
it's
a
bit
disingenuous
to
say
that
they're
not
attacking
the
instruction
or
the
common
law
inference
under
those
circumstances,
because
obviously
if
you
tell
the
jury
that
they
can
draw
the
inference
based
on
these
facts
and
then
you
say
well,
if
you
do
your
verdict
will
be
overturned,
in
effect
you
are
challenging
the
inference.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
a
point
was
raised
about
virginia's
standard
of
review
and
not
knowing
what
it
is.
i
think
that's
interesting
since
they
have
never
said
in
12
years
of
litigation
that
virginia
may
have
applied
the
wrong
standard.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
virginia
applies
a
more
stringent
standard
than
jackson.
under
virginia
law
the
evidence
must
exclude
every
reasonable
hypothesis
of
innocence.
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
jackson
decision
itself.
mr.
donald
r.
curry
that's
right,
when
it's
based
solely
on
circumstantial
evidence,
like
this
one
was.
and
to
answer
a
point
that
justice
scalia
raised,
this
is
of
course
a
general
rule
case,
and
i
think
a
basic
juxtaposition
here
shows
this.
if
the
decision
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
was
in
fact
a
decision
of
this
court
that
had
been
rendered
in
1985,
say,
well
then
west
would
have
come
to
the
federal
habeas
court
and
said
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
i
win
under
that
case.
and
the
federal
habeas
court
would
have
had
to
say
no,
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
that
case.
it
was
decided
after
your
case
became
final.
his
only
recourse
would
be
to
say
the
result
was
dictated
by
preexisting
precedent
at
the
time
my
conviction
became
final,
in
other
words
jackson
v.
virginia.
and
that's
exactly
our
point.
the
result,
this
case
is
governed
by
teague,
and
unless
it
can
be
said,
and
it
cannot
be
said
in
view
of
the
common
law
inference
which
has
existed
for
centuries,
that
the
result
in
this
case
was
dictated
by
precedent
at
the
time
his
conviction
became
final.
finally
with
regard
to
this
business
of
congressional
intent,
i
think
the
best
evidence
that
there
is
no
congressional
mandate
for
de
novo
review
is
this
court's
cases.
in
case
after
case
in
the
last
15
years
this
court
has
afforded
state
prisoners
something
far
less
than
de
novo
review,
and
in
many
instances
no
review
at
all
in
default
cases.
and
the,
in
each
of
those
cases,
in
each
of
those
line
of
cases
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
over
a
dissent
which
made
the
congressional
intent
argument,
and
of
course
the
court
necessarily
rejected
that
view
in
order
to
hold
the
way
that
it
did.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
