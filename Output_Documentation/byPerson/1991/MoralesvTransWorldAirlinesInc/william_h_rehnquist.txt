chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1604,
dan
morales,
attorney
general
of
texas,
v.
trans
world
airlines.
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gardner,
did
the
district
court
in
its
injunction
refer
in
terms
to
the
naag
guidelines?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
would
be
general
fraud
statutes
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
point
that
the
airline
could
raise
in
the
state
case
that
was
brought
against
it,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gardner.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
do
i
gather
from
your
first
point
that
you
feel
it's
necessary
to
your
case
to
show
that
the
state
here
was
intending
to
implement
the
naag
guidelines
and
not
just
general
fraud
statutes
or
deceptive
advertising
statutes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
support
the
breadth
of
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
do
you
support
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rule
65
is
quite
precise
that
the
injunction
was
set
out
not
in
the
light
of
something
else,
but
very
precisely,
exactly
what
is
enjoined.
i
don't
know
that
rule
65
leaves
any
latitude
to
go
back
to
the
complaint
and
say
well,
let's
see
if
we
can't
get
another
reading
out
of
the
actual
order.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
order
did
not
mention
the
naag
guidelines?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent,
mr.
jones,
suggests
that
congress,
in
enacting
the
erisa
statute,
intended
to,
quote,
occupy
the
field,
whereas
here
congressional
intent
was
not
the
same,
and
that
therefore
the
phrases,
though
identical
language,
should
not
be
read
the
same
in
the
two
acts.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
section
1506
of
title
49
that
says
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
shall
in
any
way
abridge
or
alter
the
remedies
now
existing
at
common
law
or
by
statute,
but
this
provision
of
this
or
in
addition--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
suggesting
it
was
repealed
by
implication?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
only
if
you
read
the
preemption
clause
the
way
you
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
nightingale.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
airline
advertises
dallas
to
washington,
d.c.,
100
dollars,
and
i
show
up
for
a
ticket
and
they
say
well,
no,
it's
200
dollars,
we
just
didn't
mean
what
we
said
in
that
ad.
can
the
state
enforce
deceptive
advertising
law
in
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
answer
given
isn't
that
there
are
no
seats.
it's
simply
that
although
we
said
we'd
charge
you
$100,
we're
going
to
charge
you
$200,
and
there
are
lots
of
seats
on
this
plane.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
gardner,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gardner.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1604,
morales
against
trans
world
airlines
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
