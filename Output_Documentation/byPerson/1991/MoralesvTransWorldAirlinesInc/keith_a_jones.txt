mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
hope
to
develop
three
points.
first,
to
show
that
this
case
involves
state
implementation
of
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
naag
guidelines
and
not,
as
the
states
argue,
their
enforcement
of
consumer
protection
laws
generally.
second,
to
establish
that
section
105
of
the
deregulation
act
should
be
given
the
same
broad,
common
sense
meaning
as
the
similarly
worded
erisa
preemption
statute.
and
third,
to
demonstrate
that
the
rules
articulated
by
the
naag
guidelines
fall
well
within
the
preemptive
scope
of
section
105
as
so
construed.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
think
that's
integral
to
our
argument,
but
i
think
that
it's
important
to
inform
the
court
what
the
case
is
really
about,
because
the
state
takes
the
position
that
it
has
been
enjoined
from
enforcing
its
consumer
protection
laws
generally,
and
we
brought
this
case
specifically
targeted
at
those
eight
postscriptions
that
are
articulated
in
the
naag
guidelines.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
states
are
concerned
about
the
breadth
of
the
ordering
paragraph
in
the
injunction--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--i
don't
think
that
the
ordering
paragraph
as
such
was
correctly
written,
but
i
think
that
if
you
read
that
paragraph,
not
in
isolation
but
in
the
context
of
what
the
district
court
said
earlier
in
the
text
of
the
same
order
and
also
read
it
in
light
of
the
complaint
which
narrowly
focuses
on
the
naag
guidelines,
you
will
agree
with
us
that
the
proper
construction
of
the
injunction
is
that
it
just
bars
the
state--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--this
order
was
very
broadly
phrased.
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
subsequent
history
of
the
litigation
in
the
district
court
confirmed
that
all
of
the
parties
understood
that
the
injunction
only
ran
against
the
naag
guidelines
and
not
against
consumer
protection
law
generally.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
actually
the
order
does
mention
the
naag
guidelines
twice
in
its
first
paragraphs,
but
what
counsel
for
the
state
has
focused
your
attention
on
is
the
particular
ordering
language
of
the
injunction.
but
the
order
itself
begins
with
the
discussion
of
the
naag
guidelines
and
that
is
the
context
within
which
the
ordering
paragraph
should
be
read.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
may
be
that
in
a
future
case
this
court
will
so
hold.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
our
argument
is
that
the
particular
restrictions
placed
upon
airfare
advertising
by
these
guidelines
themselves
are
plainly
barred,
whatever
application
state
consumer
protection
law
may
have
in
other
contexts.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
think
the
consumer
protection
laws
as
they
apply
to
airfare
advertising
are
preempted,
but
the
analysis
that
we
set
forth
is
an
attempt
to
show
why
these
guidelines
in
particular
interfere
with
the
pro-competitive
policy
of
the
statute.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
on
the
face
of
it
you
would
think
that
they
were
as
closely
related.
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
the
deregulation
act
was
to
establish
a
freely
competitive
marketplace
with
a
strong
bias
in
favor
of
free
competition.
and
after,
with
the
advent
of
deregulation
the
airlines,
under,
continuing
to
be
under
the
regulation,
regulatory
authority
of
the
department
of
transportation,
developed
a
new
pricing
policy,
a
pro-competitive
pricing
policy
called
yield
management.
and
yield
management
is
designed
to
maximize
revenues
while
at
the
same
time
filling
as
many
seats
as
possible.
and
it
has
two
salient
features.
this
is
a
long-winded
answer,
but
i
think
i
will
get
there
ultimately.
one
of
the
features
of
yield
management
is
a
multi-tiered
pricing
structure
under
which
different
prices
are
charged
for
different
tickets
that
have
different
restrictions
relating
to
refundability,
advance
purchase,
length
of
stay,
time
of
day
or
day
of
week,
and
so
forth.
and
the
other
salient
feature
is
that
the
mix
of
fares
on
every
flight
is
under
continuous
review
and
revision
as
the
flight
date
approaches.
the
naag
guidelines
are
contrary,
actually
they
make
it
virtually
impossible
to
conduct
yield
management
programs.
dot
has
recognized
this.
it
has
pointed
out
that
yield
management
is
an
essential
feature
of
competition
in
a
deregulated
air
transport
market.
the
guidelines
require
every
restriction,
each
and
every
restriction,
to
be
stated
in
each
and
every
ad
with
respect
to
every
advertised
fare,
and
they
also
require
that
these
restrictions
be
etched
in
stone
for
a
fixed
period
of
time.
these
requirements
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
the
pro-competitive
yield
management
program
that
congress,
i
mean
that
dot
approves
and
the
airlines
have
developed
under
deregulation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
was
trying
to
get
to
where
you
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
the
naag
guidelines,
and
then
let
me
discuss
the
broader
question
that
you
have
raised,
justice
o'connor.
just
one
last
note
with
respect
to
advertising
and
the
guidelines.
the
problem
therefore
with
the
guidelines
that
may
or
may
not
pertain
to
other
consumer
protection
laws
is
that
they
directly
interfere
with
the
efficiency
innovation
and
low
prices
that
congress
explicitly
asked
dot
to
help
further
in
its
administration
of
the
statute.
now,
more
generally,
justice
o'connor,
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
argument
given
by
mr.
gardner,
section
105
does
employ
the
same
preemptive
formula
as
the
erisa
statute.
just
as
erisa
preempts
all
state
laws
that
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans,
so
section
105
preempts
all
state
laws
relating
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
of
any
air
carrier.
and
in
construing
erisa
this
court
has
said
that
the
phrase
relating
to
means
having
a
connection
with
or
reference
to
the
statutory
subject.
i
understand
that
that's
not,
that's
just
the
beginning
of
analysis.
that's
not
by
any
means
the
end
of
analysis.
but
we
submit
that
that
first
step
is
one
that
needs
to
be
taken,
that
section
105,
like
the
similarly
worded
erisa
statute,
should
be
construed
as
preempting
all
state
laws
that
have
a
connection
with
or
reference
to
airfares.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
texas
does
not
have
an
income
tax
law,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
the
phrase
relating
to
could
encompass
a
very
broad
spectrum,
and--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--i
think
that
our
position
is
that
the
formulation
relating
to
naturally
encompasses
all
state
laws
whose
enforcement
would
be
likely,
likely
to
affect
the
actual
level
of
rates
or
the
routes
or
services
in
a
manner
that
was
contrary
to
the
underlying
pro-competitive
policy
of
the
deregulation
act.
therefore
i
don't
think
we
can
give
any
clear
cut
answer
to
broad
hypotheticals
of
this
kind,
although
they
do
seem
to
be
far
removed
from
the
immediate
rate
setting
process
with
which
we
are
concerned
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we're
suggesting
that
the
statute
has
to
be
applied
in
the
same
way
as
the
erisa
statute,
and
in
those
erisa
cases
the
court
has
looked
at
the
operation
of
state
law,
has
analyzed
the
operation
of
state
law
in
relation
to
the
objectives
of
the
federal
statute.
and
that
is
a
process
that
does
require
case-by-case
adjudication,
but
it
is
a
process
that
gives
effect
to
the
relational
concept
underlying
the
statute
and
also
effectuates
the
underlying
statutory
purposes
that
can
be
constructed
from
not
only
the
preemption
statute
but
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
as
well.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
our
response
is
that
in
this
context
the
difference
between
regulation
and
deregulation
is,
the
distinction
is
one
without
a
difference.
in
erisa
the
court
was,
the
congress
was
identifying
an
area
in
which
it
wanted
to
keep
the
states
out
and
it
was
an
exclusively
federal
regulatory
domain.
here
congress
has
created
an
area
in
which
the
states
also
are
supposed
to
be
kept
out
because
it
is
left
to
the
marketplace
and
to
the
continuing
pro-competitive
regulation
by
the
department
of
transportation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
something
of
an
anomaly.
section
1106
was
enacted
in
1938
and
when
the
deregulation
act
was
enacted
in
1978
section
1106
was
continued
without
any
discussion.
i
don't
think
that
the
undiscussed
continuation
of
an
ancient
savings
clause
should
undermine
the--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--well,
to
some
extent
any
later
enacted
preemption
clause
will
be
incompatible
with
the
full
breadth
of
an
earlier
savings
clause.
i
don't
know
whether
you
would
call
it
repealed
by
implication,
but
there
is
an
obvious
incompatibility
between
a
preemption
clause
and
a
savings
clause.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
however
you
read
the
preemption
clause
it
will
bar
some
state
remedies,
it
will
eliminate
some
state
remedies
that
could
previously
have
been
in
existence.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
essentially
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we're
not
claiming
that
here,
no.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i'm
not
sure
if
burdensome
is
the
word
that
i
would
choose.
it
has
to
be
sufficiently,
it
has
to
sufficiently
implicate
the
pro-competitive
concerns
of
the
statute,
that
is
it
has
to
interfere
with
the
rate
setting
process
in
the
freely
competitive
market.
let
me
go
back
to
the
fraud--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--perhaps
there
isn't.
let
me
go
back
to
the
fraud
hypothetical.
it's
conceivable
that
a
fraud
claim
could
rest
upon
a
claim
that
there
was
a
deceptive
ad,
and
perhaps
such
a
fraud
claim
would
indeed
be
preempted
if
the
argument
about
deception
was
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
the
states
make
here
with
respect
to
the
guidelines,
or
that
underlie
the
guidelines.
other
fraud
claims,
however,
might
have
nothing
to
do
with
deceptive
advertising
as
such
and
they
would
fall
well
outside
the
line
that
we're
trying
to
draw.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
congress
did
specifically
provide
that
the
states
could
continue
to
impose
certain
kinds
of
taxes
and
it
also
provided
that
their
proprietary
control
over
airports
and
their
regulations
issued
in
connection
with
that
were
not
preempted.
congress
foresaw
that
the
preemption
statute
might
other
wise
sweep
in
these
provisions
and
for
that
reason
it
explicitly
exempted
them
from
the
preemption
statute.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
with
respect
to
the
proprietary
operations,
that's
in
the
preemption
statute
itself.
i
think
it's
subsection
b.
with
respect
to
the
taxes,
i
cannot
now
remember
the
name,
the
number
of
the
section,
but
it
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
wardair
canada
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
let
me
address
if
i
might
the
state's
argument
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
only
to
bar
the
states
from
engaging
in
what
they
called
utility
type
regulation.
that
argument
is
self-defeating.
these
guidelines
are
a
perfect
example
of
utility
type
regulation.
they
represent
precisely
the
kind
of
controlled
supervision
over
rate
advertising
in
which
state
public
utility
commissions
commonly
engage.
thus
if
section
105
is
to
be
given
the
reading
that
the
states
themselves
say
they
prefer,
this
case
at
least
is
at
an
end.
and
i
think
it
would
be
sufficient
for
purposes
of
this
case
only
if
the
court
were
to
decide
whatever
other
further
preemptive
scope
section
105
may
have.
at
least
it
does
preempt
utility
type
regulation
of
the
kind
involved
in
this
case.
