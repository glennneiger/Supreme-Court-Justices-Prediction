justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gardner,
we
have
to
decide,
i
guess,
what
it
is
that
the
language
that
congress
used
means,
and
it
chose
to
use
language
that
preempts,
federally
preempts
state
laws
relating
to
rates,
routes,
or
services.
that's
the
language
it
chose,
relating
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
congress
to
have
used
the
language
of
preempting
state
law
determining
rates
or
setting
rates
or
something
of
that
kind,
but
it
didn't.
it
said
relating
to.
and
in
the
erisa
context
this
court
has
interpreted
that
identical
phrase
in
a
fairly
expansive
manner,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
you
say
that
advertisement
of
airline
rates
and
fares
does
not
relate
to
airline
rates
and
fares?
can
you
really
say
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
the
injunction?
where
do
we
turn
to
it,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
i
think
we've
had
a
little
difficulty
this
afternoon
in
getting
either
you
or
mr.
gardner
to
articulate
for
us
the
guiding
principle
to
be
used
by
us
in
resolving
this
case.
each
of
you
wants
to
focus
only
on
the
specific
regulation
at
issue
here
without
regard
for
the
many
other
issues
that
are
going
to
arise
in
the
future.
preemption
is
serious
business,
and
if
this
statute
is
to
be
given
a
broad
reading
then
i
assume
this
court
would
be
faced
with
a
whole
range
of
cases
in
the
future
in
which
it
is
alleged
that
certain
state
and
local
laws
and
regulations
are
preempted.
for
example,
i
suppose
it
can
be
argued
that
the
texas
income
tax
law
might
affect
the
airfares
charged
by
an
airline.
are
texas
income
taxes
preempted?
maybe
texas
liquor
laws
affect
what
alcohol
can
be
served
in
one
of
these
airline
clubs.
are
those
preempted?
what
about
the
zoning
laws
that
tell
us
where
and
how
airline
terminals
can
be
built?
where
does,
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
that
include
state
income
tax
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
other
states
do,
of
course.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
zoning
laws?
liquor
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nightingale,
before
you
sit
down
i
would
like
to
just
have
some
description
of
the
principle
by
which
we
should
decide
these
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
haven't
heard
it.
i
haven't
heard
it
from
mr.
gardner,
i
didn't
hear
it
from
mr.
jones.
i'm
curious
if
i'm
going
to
hear
one
from
you.
