justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
was
raised
by
your
response
to
justice
kennedy?
you
said
if
you
had
these
conflicting
regulations
in
different
states
that
created
a
problem
of
uniformity
that
the
department
of
transportation
could
step
in
and
preempt
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pursuant
to
what
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
go
out
and
preempt
a
lot
of
state
laws?
that's
a
novel
concept.
they
have
the
authority
to
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
at
the
airlines,
but
i
don't
know
if
they
have
any,
i'm
not
aware...
i
was
just
interested
in
the
source
of
that
suggestion.
you're
saying
it's
some
sort
of
inherent
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
had,
say,
not
an
airline
industry,
say
in
the
automobile
industry
that
all
the
automobile
companies
wanted,
were
subjected
to
a
lot
of
conflicting
regulations
on
advertising,
the
same
kind
of
thing
justice
kennedy
suggested.
is
there
some
federal
agency
that
can
go
out
and
say
you
can't,
everything
would
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
a
rule
making
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
jones,
isn't
it
your
position
that
the
consumer
protection
laws
are
generally
preempted
insofar
as
they
apply
to
airline
advertising
of
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
your
position
in
this
case?
isn't
that
what
you
argue
the
scope
of
the
preemption
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory?
justice
scalia
asked
you
about
fraud
in
the
sale
of
tickets,
and
i
understood
your
answer
to
be
that's
probably
not
preempted
because
it
doesn't
have
a
sufficient
direct
impact
on
the
rate
making
process.
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
you
would
also
say
that,
say
regulation,
state
regulations
prohibited
obscene
advertising
or
advertising
of
liquor
in
conjunction
with
airline
travel
in
the
terminal
would
not
be
preempted
if
it
didn't
have
any
significant
burden?
you're
not
claiming
all
regulation
by
the
states
of
advertising
that
mentions
rates
is
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
got
to
be
sufficiently
burdensome
to
affect
the
rate
making
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
big
difference
between
what
you
said
and
what
i
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
emphasize
burden
rather
than
the
content
of
the
ads,
you
seem
to
admit
that
a
lot
of
ads
could
be
regulated
that
mention
rates
in
the
airline
terminal
and
the
like.
and
if
you
emphasize
burden,
then
i
don't
know
how
you
get
around
justice
o'connor's
question
about
suppose
they
have
rent
control
or
they
impose
some
heavy
costs
on
the
operation
of
airline
terminals
or
something
like
that,
the
way
they
handle
their
dealings
with
their
car
rental
agencies
or
something
of
that
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
exemption
are
you
talking
about
now?
what
statutory
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
now,
does
that
go
so
far
as
to
say
they
can't
regulate
obscene
advertising
in
the
airport?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
ads
with
the
rates
put
on
them,
or
maybe
not
obscene
but
the
character
of
the
advertising,
having
people
serving
liquor,
say,
at
the
time
some
states
are
concerned
about
that.
could
they
prohibit
the
showing
of
drinking
liquor
on
an
airline
in
a
picture
in
connection
with
the
rates
for
the
flight?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
just
ban
all
advertising
in
the
waiting
room
of
the
airport--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thinking
it's
not
aesthetically
suited
to
the,
you
know,
to
the
terminal
or
something
like
that?
they
couldn't
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
talking
about
advertising
by,
not
by
the
proprietor,
by
the
airline.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
the
state
could
decide
that
we
don't,
we
want,
just
like
they
don't
want
people
soliciting
for,
you
know...
for
one
reason
or
another
they
just
don't
want
to
have
the
appearance
cluttered
up
with
rate
advertising
in
front
of
the
terminals
or
anything
like
that.
