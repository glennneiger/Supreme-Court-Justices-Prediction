r.
white
i
don't
understand
why
you
just
don't
argue
that
insofar
as
the
consumer
protection
laws
are
enforced
against,
are
attempted
to
be
enforced
against
airline
advertising
it's
just
preempted.
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
is
there
something...
if
that
isn't
the
argument,
then
i
would
suppose
you
would
have
answered
the
chief
justice
that
the
guidelines
argument
is,
is
integral
to
your
argument.
