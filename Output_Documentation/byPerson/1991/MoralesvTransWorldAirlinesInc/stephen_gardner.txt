mr.
stephen
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
did
not
intend
to
strip
the
state
of
texas
of
its
right
to
use
its
traditional
police
powers
to
protect
its
citizens
from
deceptive
airline
advertising.
congress
never
suggested
that
texas
is
not
free
to
sue
individual
airlines
in
its
state
courts
for
specific
violations
of
its
general
state
consumer
protection
act,
yet
that
is
precisely
the
result
of
the
decision
of
a
court
below.
the
district
court
entered
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
a
sweeping
injunction
against
texas
that
prohibited
the
state
from
any
type
of
law
enforcement
action
that
would
regulate
or
restrict
any
aspect
of
the
individually
named
plaintiff
airline's
airfare
advertising
or
their
other
operations
involving
their
rates,
routes,
and
services.
if
i
may
take
just
a
few
moments
to
put
this
case
into
context
for
the
court.
this
case
arose
when
the
state
of
texas
and
several
other
state
attorneys
general
wrote
to
a
few
airlines
in
november
of
1988
advising
them
that
their
practices
of
segmenting
out
certain
portions
of
their
airfares
from
the
advertised
fare
and
putting
it
into
the
fine
print
of
the
footnotes
of
an
advertisement,
thereby
reducing
an
ad
from,
say,
$321
to
$298,
were
violations
of
their
state
deceptive
practices
laws.
we
wrote
to
only
five
of
the
airlines
that
are
in
this
litigation.
we
offered
those
airlines
an
opportunity
to
resolve
this
matter
without
litigation.
rather
than
taking
us
up
on
that
offer
the
airlines
themselves
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
against
first,
the
state
of
texas,
and
later
expanded
that
lawsuit
to
include
33
other
state
attorneys
general.
from
that
lawsuit
the
district
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
that
was
later
converted
to
a
permanent
injunction
that
was
as
i
have
already
set
forth.
what
this
case
is
about
is
the
right
of
the
state
of
texas
to
enforce
its
state
consumer
protection
act
to
stop
illegal,
deceptive
segmenting
out
of
surcharges.
it's
not
about
anything
broader
than
that.
it
is
specifically
not
about
the
naag
guidelines
that
the
airlines
make
a
bit
about
in
their
brief.
we're
not
here
before
the
court
on
enforcement
of
the
naag
guidelines
because
the
states
never
attempted
to
do
so.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
same
time
it
passed
it
the
conference
report
referred
to
that
language
as
preemption
of
anything
regulating
rates,
routes,
or
services.
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
what
congress--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--yes,
your
honor,
we
urge
the
court
not
to
apply
the
same
interpretation
precepts
to
the
federal
aviation
act
as
this
court
has
indeed
applied
in
the
erisa
context,
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
erisa
was
a
very
broadly
preemptive
law
because
its
prime
scope
was
in
essence
for
the
federal
government
to
occupy
the
field
of
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans.
that
was
not
the
case
here.
we
have
to
look
at
what,
coming
into
1978
when
this
relating
to
language
was
adopted,
what
was
congress
setting
about
to
change.
prior
to
'78
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
nader
decision
in
1976,
had
enjoyed
a
dual
enforcement
relationship
with
respect
to
consumer
protection
type
laws.
nothing
prior
to
'78
preempted
the
states
or
prevented
the
states
from
enforcing
their
own
laws.
in
1978
what
was
congress
trying
to
do?
was
congress
trying
to
keep
the
states
out
of
the
area
of
consumer
protection?
i
think
our
answer
is
affirm
nothing
of
the
kind.
what
congress
was
doing
in
1978
was
deregulating
the
federal
government's
control
that
had
existed
since
the
thirties,
i
believe,
of
the
rates,
routes,
and
services,
the
direct--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--that's
not
really
the
question.
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
i
may
not
be
able
to
say
that,
but
that's
not
what
congress
was
preempting.
congress
was
preempting
only
state
laws
that
relate
to
rates,
routes,
and
services,
not
state
laws
that
relate
to
advertising
which
then
relate
to
rates,
routes,
and
services.
mr.
stephen
gardner
as
long
as
those
guidelines
did
not
regulate
the
rates,
routes,
and
services,
and
i
would
say
they
would
not,
i
would
think
that
statute
would
be
valid.
if
the
court--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--it
is
convenient.
but
if
the
court...
rather,
if
the
court
applied
the
broad
scope
of
erisa
reading
and
brought
all
of
the
concepts
that
underlie
the
broad
erisa
preemption
and
use
that
in
interpreting
what
congress
intended,
not
when
it
said
relating
to,
but
when
it
enacted
the
1978
act,
then
under
that
kind
of
interpretation
perhaps
you
could
say
that
regulation
such
as
the
naag
guidelines
would
relate
to
it.
mr.
stephen
gardner
but
the
guidelines,
your
honor,
i
mean,
it's
essentially
a
false
issue.
i'm
happy
to
address
it,
but
we're
not
here
on
that.
we're
here
on
a
very
narrow
effort
by
the
states
to
address
specific
violations.
the
guidelines
and
the--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
taking
the
position
that
it
could
not.
i'm
taking
the
position
that
even
if
it
did
so,
under
the
preemption
of
the
federal
aviation
act
it
would
not
be
preempted.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
would
not
assert--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
under
the
current
law
could
do
so.
i
would
have
serious
questions--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--the
state
consumer
protection
law,
your
honor,
prohibits
any
industry,
not
the
airlines,
and
that's
one
important
point.
it's
a
general
applicable,
generally
applicable
law.
it
prohibits
any
person
selling
or
leasing
goods
or
services
from
engaging
in
false,
misleading,
or
deceptive
acts
or
practices.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
gardner
well,
as
i
said
earlier--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--it
would
require
a
two
step
bootstrapping
argument,
and--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--no,
your
honor,
i
am--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--my
argument
is
focused
on
what
the
state
did
do
here,
your
honor.
state
legislatures
do
a
myriad
of
things,
not
all
of
which
i
would
want
to
stand
before
this
court
and
support.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
current
law
does
not
permit
that
sort
of
action,
nor,
in
my
belief,
would
the
first
amendment
permit
the
court
to
take,
the
state
to
take
that
sort
of
action.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
would
say
that
the
state
could
do
that,
and
congress
could
then
act
to
prohibit
that
action.
the--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--no,
your
honor,
although
the
airlines
advise
the
court
that
they
did.
i
read
the
court
the
precise
language
there.
we
are
enjoined
from
initiating
any
enforcement
action
or
actions
pursuant
to
any
provision
of
state
law
which--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--the
way
we
read
it,
your
honor,
it's
any
statute,
whether
it's
a
criminal
statute,
a
licensing
statute.
we
believe
that
the
language
that
is
before
this
court,
the
injunction
of
the
district
court,
is
broad
enough
that
we
cannot,
in
the
state
of
texas,
take
any
type
of
enforcement
action
because
the
way
this
injunction
is
worded,
the
injunction
that
the
airlines
sought,
we
are
broadly
preempted
from
any
form
of
regulation
of
airlines.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
apologize
for
not
having
it
handy.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
thank
you.
looking
at
what
congress
set
out
to
do
in
'78,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
take
the
states
out
of
the
business,
it
did
not
intend
to
take
the
federal
government
out
of
the
business
of
regulating
deceptive
practices.
section
411
of
the
federal
aviation
act
had
existed
for
some
time.
congress
not
only
did
not
touch
that
aspect
of
federal
regulation,
it
in
fact
enjoined
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
now
the
department
of
transportation,
even
more
broadly
to
prohibit
anticompetitive
and
deceptive
practices
in
the
airline
industry.
this
indicates
that
congress
indeed
intended
and
in
fact
achieved
a
split
type
of
deregulation.
congress
did
deregulate
the
utility-type
rate
making
setting
of
the
airlines
rates,
routes,
and
services.
it
did
not
intend,
nor
did
it
achieve,
anything
that
took
the
federal
government
out
of
the
business
of
regulating
and
prohibiting
deceptive
practices
by
airlines.
we
believe
that
this
shows
congress'
intent
to
deregulate
only
that
one
area,
the
utility-like
setting
of
rates,
routes,
and
services
that
the
federal
agencies
had
engaged
in
broadly
and
that
in
fact
a
number
of
states
had
engaged
in
on
a
piecemeal
basis
in
the
past.
mr.
stephen
gardner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
gardner
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
gardner
because
congress
intended
no
regulation
of
fares,
period,
regardless
of--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--competitive
advertising
can
only
exist
if
the
advertising
is
truthful
and
is
not
deceptive.
if
a
competitor
loses
business
to
another
airline
because
that
other
airline
has
advertised
in
a
way
that
makes
it
appear
as
though
they
are
cheaper
when
in
fact
they
are
not,
they
are
going
to
lose
business.
they
are
not
a
better
competitor,
they
are
just
more
creative,
and
from
their
standpoint,
or
from
our
standpoint,
unfortunately
deceptive
advertising.
mr.
stephen
gardner
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--there
is
no
prohibition
there,
your
honor.
we
do
recognize
that
the
states
have
rights
to
regulate
the
advertising
that
is
directed
at
their
citizens
and
that
appears
within
their
borders.
we
may
argue
with
the
department
of
transportation
as
to
whether
or
not
that's
the
best
way
of
doing
things,
but
the
simple
fact
is
right
now
what
we're
before
the
court
to
argue
about
is
not
that.
it
is
actions
that
are
in
fact
illegal
under
currently
adopted
federal
regulation.
federal
regulation
as
it
now
exists,
not
as
the
department
has
proposed
to
amend
it
but
as
it
now
exists,
prohibits
the
very
actions
that
the
state
of
texas
would
seek
to
prohibit.
we're
trying
to
have
the
right
to
take
these
what
are
to
the
state
fairly
minor
type
cases,
these
are
just
another
run
of
false
advertising
cases.
they're
the
types
of
cases
that
we
would
bring
against
a
myriad
of
companies
for
false
price
advertising
and
have
brought
against
department
stores
or
groceries
stores
or
car
dealers
or
electronics
retailers.
we
merely
want
the
right
to
take
a
fixed
question,
not
a
speculation
as
to
what
the
naag
guidelines
might
do,
but
rather
a
fixed
question
as
to
whether
this
advertisement
that
has
letters
3
inches
high
saying
$298,
while
there
is
an
additional
$23
or
even
more
in
surcharges,
whether
that's
deceptive
under
texas
law.
we
want
to
take
that
to
a
texas
court
and
present
that
to
a
texas
jury.
if
it
isn't
deceptive,
then
we
lose.
even
if
it
is
deceptive--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--your
honor,
all
we
are
seeking
here
today
is
a
declaration
that
the
texas
deceptive
trade
practices
act
as
written
and
as
enforced,
or
attempted
to
be
enforced
in
this
case,
is
not
preempted
because
as
written
and
as
enforced
it
does
not
regulate
and
therefore
does
not
relate
to
the
rates,
routes,
and
services.
i
will
absolutely
grant
that
if
a
state
statute
does
regulate,
whether
directly
or
indirectly,
and
has
a
direct
and
substantial
effect
on
the
decisions
as
to
setting
rates,
routes,
or
services
by
the
airline
people
who
are
setting
those
rates,
routes,
and
services,
there
is
going
to
be
preemption
under
the
law
as
written.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
states,
the
airlines
from
litigating
every
aspect
of
preemption
in
the
state
courts.
as
i
was
about
to
say
to,
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
if
the
airlines
lose
to
a
jury
and
cannot
convince
a
jury
that
they
acted
non-deceptively,
or
if
we
actually
bear
our
burden,
as
any
other
litigant,
of
convincing
the
jury
that
they
have
in
fact
acted
deceptively,
they
can
still
convince
the
judge
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
texas
law
has
been
violated
because
texas
law
goes
too
far.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
gardner
absolutely.
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
way
it
ought
to
be,
and
i
am
saying
that
is
not
the
way
it
is.
the
states
are
not
in
fact
regulating
in
a
different
manner.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
they
would
not,
but
i
would
also
say
in
that
instance
in
my
own
opinion
that
that
is
when
it's
appropriate
for
the
department
of
transportation
to
step
in
and
preempt
us.
the
department
has
its
authority
to
preempt
the
states
if
what
the
states
are
doing--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--your
honor,
the
airlines...
this
case
came
to
the
court
on
virtually
no
factual
evidence
at
all.
this,
we
had
a...
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
3
days
later
we
had
a
temporary
restraining
order
hearing,
there
was
no
testimony,
and
that's
all
we
have
for
a
record.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that,
exactly
that,
much
less
merely
telling
an
airline
that
it
should
put
in
the
big
print
what
the
actual
cost
of
flying
is
has
any
effect
whatsoever
on
rates,
routes,
or
services.
the
airlines
speculate
that.
they
raise
a
number
of
fears
that
this
might
have,
and
therefore
the
federal
court
should
get
involved
and
stop
the
state
from
a
conjectured
enforcement
of
its
law.
but
that
is
simply
not
what
has
happened
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that.
in
fact
the
very
limited
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
some
airlines
were
in
fact
including
this
previous
surcharge
in
their
full
fare
during
1988
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
damage
to
those
airlines,
that
they
stopped
advertising
or
that
they
raised
rates,
or
that
anything
happened
that
had
any
effect,
direct,
indirect,
or
insubstantial.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
gardner
we
believe
that
the
department
has
intrinsic
authority
under,
as
the
interpreter
of
the
federal
aviation
act,
to
say
that
this--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--i
am
speculating
that
they
could
do
that.
i
would
also
speculate
the
states
would
probably
fight
them
and
we'd
be
back
here
on
that.
but
there
is,
there
are
instances--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--i
believe
the
federal
trade
commission
would
assert
to
this
court
that
it
did
have
that
intrinsic
authority.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
by
full
flown
rule
making.
by
rule
making
that
is
published,
opportunity
for
comment,
and
fully
considered.
there
are
instances
that
we
could
conjecture
where
the
department
of
transportation
could
properly
preempt
the
state,
but
again,
that
is
just
not
the
situation
that
we
have
here
today.
all
we
have
here
today
is
this
limited
action
of
the
state.
it's
a
minor
attempt
to...
you
know,
all
of
our
cases
are
not
minor.
i
shouldn't
say
that.
these
are
significant
cases,
but
they
are
not
different
than
an
attempt
to
stop
a
department
store
or
a
grocery
store
or
any
other
retailer
of
services
or
goods
from
misrepresenting
what
it
costs
to
buy
those
services
or
goods.
what
the
airlines
want
and
are
asking
this
court
to
say
congress
meant
to
do
was
to
give
them
carte
blanche
to
violate
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
with
impunity,
and
they
alone
would
be
able
to
do
that.
i
can
think
of
no
other
industry
that
enjoys
the
right
to
engage
in
deceptive
practices
without
any
fear
of
state
regulation.
the
airlines
are
arguing
that
they
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
in
these
days,
your
honor,
virtually
every
industry
or
company
of
any
size
engages
in
interstate
commerce.
they
may
find
themselves
having
to
comply
with
the
laws
of
different
states.
to
them
that
is
an
inconvenience.
to
the
state
of
texas
and
to
the
other
states
that
is
a
matter
of
our
sovereign
authority
within
our
federalist
system,
our
right
to
set
rules
for
companies
that
choose
to
do
business
within
our
borders
that
may
be
different
from
the
rules
set
by
other
states.
we're
not
seeking
to
create
chaos,
and
i
affirm
again
that
the
states
have
not
taken
action
that
has
in
any
way
created
the
type
of
conflicts
that
the
court
has
posited,
and
i
will
affirm
to
the
court
that
i
think
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
that
is
going
to
happen,
and
just
urge
the
court--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--the
naag
guidelines,
your
honor,
were
not
intended
to
do
anything
except
let
the
airlines
know
what
was
expected
of
them
under
our
respective
state
laws
in
an
attempt
to
achieve
uniformity.
the
idea
was
to
prevent
multiple
minor
state
litigation.
that
may
have
been
achieved.
on
the
other
hand
what
we
also
achieved,
what
naag
achieved
through
doing
the
guidelines,
they're
not
rules,
they're
just
guidelines,
the
guidelines
process
was
to
make
a
federal
case
out
of
what
we
believe
are
the
day-to-day
enforcement
type
actions
that
the
states
always
engage
in.
i
should
also--
mr.
stephen
gardner
--the
state
attorneys
general
acknowledged
the
very
fear
that
this
court
has
expressed,
that
we
did
not
want
to
set
one
standard
in
texas
and
another
standard
in
california.
it
is
possible
that
we
could
have
interpreted
our
different
laws
in
different
ways.
we
felt
that
the
fairest
way
to
the
airlines
was
to
come
about,
bring
about
an
announcement
of
the
safe
harbors,
what
we
would
expect,
what
we
would
tolerate,
so
that
airlines
could
have
the
knowledge
that
they
could
do
business,
if
they
complied
within
that
guidelines,
without
having
to
fear
prosecution
by
the
states.
we
also
made
the
point
that
they
could
also,
as
it
were,
violate
the
naag
guidelines,
they
could
ignore
the
naag
guidelines,
as
long
as
they
were
not
otherwise
deceptive.
this
was
not
a
standard.
it
was
not
a
be
all
and
end
all.
all
those
guidelines
were
were
minima
to
help
the
airlines
along.
but
what
we
look
at,
and
if
you
see
the
november
'88
notice,
what
we
relied
on
was
not
the
naag
guidelines
but
state
law
was
violated.
we
mention
state
law
six
times
in
those,
in
that
letter.
we
didn't
refer
to
the
guidelines
because
we
weren't
going
to
be
suing
under
the
guidelines.
you
can
look
at
the
lawsuit
that
texas
in
fact
filed
in
state
court
against
pan
am,
no
mention
of
the
naag
guidelines
because
our
judges
and
our
juries
don't
really
care
what
naag
had
to
say.
and
i
guess
what
we're
urging
the
court
is
to
say
the
same
thing,
to
not
care
what
naag
had
to
say,
to
look
at
what
the
state
set
out
to
do.
you
know,
i
think
that,
in
closing,
all
arguments
in
this
case
reduce
to
one
point,
whether
or
not
sound
public
policy
as
announced
by
congress
favors
preemption
of
state
authority
to
enforce
their
own
laws.
the
arguments
can
go
either
way,
and
you
will
hear
arguments
the
other
way.
texas
urges
that,
and
asks
this
court
that
the
best
action
to
take
in
this
instance
is
to
take
the
action
that
does
the
least
damage
to
federalism
and
permit
texas
to
enforce
this
law
that
does
not
regulate
rates,
routes,
or
services.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
ask
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
gardner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
gardner
i
would
merely
say
that
we
misspoke,
your
honor.
if
you
look
to
what
we
did
do,
what
we
wrote
the
airlines...
the
letter
that
serves
as
their
case
in
controversy
to
bring
this
lawsuit,
we
didn't
mention
the
naag
guidelines,
we
didn't
say
we
were
setting
out
to
enforce
them.
mr.
stephen
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
in
all
honesty
i
had
not
noticed
it.
if
we
were
to
write
it
over
we
would
never
have
said
that.
we
weren't
out
to
do
that.
mr.
stephen
gardner
to
address
justice
o'connor's
request
for
a
principle,
i
apologize
for
not
laying
it
out
and
i
will
observe
that
it
seems
to
me
strikingly
similar
to
the
one
the
airlines
announced.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
determine
that
the
federal
aviation
act
does
not
preempt
a
law
of
general
applicability
that
does
not
have
a
direct
and
substantial
effect
on
the
rates,
routes,
and
services
of
an
airline.
but
the
unfortunate
result
there
is
that
that
does
require
a
remand
because
we
have
not
had
a
record
developed
here,
as
we
have
pointed
out.
we
do
not
believe
the
airlines
will
succeed
in
developing
such
a
record
because
we
do
not
believe
that
regulation
of
false
advertising
does
indeed
have
that
direct
and
substantial
effect,
nor,
to
use
the
erisa
test,
does
this
state
law
have
any
connection
with
rates,
routes,
or
services,
or
any
reference
to.
even
if
you
use
the
erisa
test
our
enforcement
of
our
state
consumer
protection
law
fails.
mr.
stephen
gardner
there
is
no
record
of
any
effect
of
any
of
the,
whether
the
guidelines
or
the
actual
enforcement
of
the
state
law.
the
airlines
say
oh,
mercy,
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
to
me,
but
they
do
not
show
that
this
is
what
will.
the
record
is
full
of
conjecture,
speculation.
the
lawsuit
was
fundamentally,
although
there
is
case
in
controversy,
fundamentally
premature.
that's
why
we
urge
the
court
to
let
us
try
these
cases
in
state
court
where
the
facts
can
be
fully
developed.
thank
you.
