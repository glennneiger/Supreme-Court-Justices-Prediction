mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like,
if
i
could,
to
take
the
narrow
and
then
the
broad
that
have
concerned
the
court
this
afternoon,
first
of
all
narrowly.
the
deregulation
act
prohibits
states
from
enacting
or
enforcing
any
law
that
relates
to
rates,
routes,
or
services.
state
laws
that
restrict
the
form
and
content
of
advertising
of
airfares
relate
directly
to
airfares.
advertising
is
an
important
channel
of
communication
between
sellers
and
potential
buyers
of
air
transportation.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
obscene
advertising
would
not
relate
to
rates
in
our
opinion.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
liquor
example
is
a
special
case
because
it
involves,
the
states
have
special
authority
in
that
situation.
i
would
think
that
liquor
would
be
subject
to
state
regulation.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
no,
your
honor,
they
could
not
ban
advertising
in
the
waiting
room
of
the
airport.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
there
are,
there
is
an
exemption
in
the
act
for
the
rights
exercised
by
proprietors
of
airports,
state
proprietors,
and
on
reflection
i
think
that
the
sorts
of
regulations
that
have
to
do
with
the
maintenance
of
the
environment
in
the
airport,
like
the
anti
noise
regulation,
would
be
within
that
exemption.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
well,
the
proprietor
i
believe
has
proprietary
rights
to
maintain
the
airport.
i
understood
that
your
airfare
advertising
ban
in
airports
was
one
imposed
by
the
airport
owner
as
a
way
of
maintaining
the
atmosphere.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
state
tried
to
do
it
in
the
capacity
other
than
as
proprietor
of
the
airport
it
would
be
preempted.
airfare
advertising
assures
in
particular
that
discount
fares,
the
sorts
of
fares
that
the
deregulation
act
was
designed
to
encourage,
come
to
the
attention
of
consumers.
unless
sellers
of
air
transportation
can
make
the
availability
of
those
fares
known
to
potential
purchasers
in
a
cost
effective
way
they
will
have
a
greatly
reduced
incentive
to
offer
them.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
the
line
that
the
department
draws
with
respect
to
that
is
if
the
misrepresentation
is
a
situation
in
which
the
airline
fails
to
produce
on
a
contractual
promise,
in
other
words
if
i
walk
up
to
the
ticket
counter
and
i
am
told
that
if
i
give
you
100
dollars
you'll
deposit
me
in
san
francisco,
and
in
fact
you
drop
me
off
in
chicago,
that
i
have
an
action
under
state
law
to
enforce
my
contract
to
be,
to
have
the
terms
of
the
contract
enforced.
however,
if
the
nature
of
the
deception
is
one
that
relates
to
the
description
of
the
service
in
a
way
that
doesn't
give
rise
to
an
enforceable
promise,
it
falls
within
the
area
in
which
the
department
balances
pro-competitive
policies
and
protection
of
the
individual.
so
the--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
no,
because
federal
law
specifies
the
nature
of
the
contract
of
carriage
between
an
individual
and
an
air
carrier,
so
that
there
would
not
be
a
way
around
this
for
the
states
simply
to
recast
law
regulating
deceptive
advertising
in
the
form
of
contract
law.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
no.
that
law
is
preempted
because
what
the
situation
is...
remember
that
in
the
air
carriage
industry
what
you
have
is
a
finite
airplane.
everyone
understands
that
when
you
are
booking
seats
what
you
are
talking
about
is
getting
there
while
there
are
seats
still
available.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
again,
that
would
be
preempted
is
our
position,
preempted
because
the
regulation
of
what
is
said
about
fares,
deceptive
practices
is
a,
that
is
an
area
that
is
committed
to
the
department
of
transportation.
it...
maybe
if
i
could
get,
in
connection
with
your
question,
to
the
general
framework
here
that
we
think
decides
these
difficult
cases,
cases
incidentally
that
are
far
more
difficult
than
the
one
before
the
court
today.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
deregulation
act
involved
essentially
the
passive
withdrawal
of
direct
controls
on
rates,
routes,
and
services.
in
fact
the
act
did
more
than
that.
it
set
forth
in
addition
new
regulatory
criteria
to
guide
the
department
of
transportation
in
exercising
the
authority
that
remained
to
it.
among
the
authority
that
remained
to
the
department
of
transportation
was
the
authority
to
protect
consumers
against
deceptive
practices.
in
exercising
that
authority
it
seeks
to
balance
pro-competitive
objectives
with
protection
of
the
consumer,
recognizing
first
of
all
that
there
is
not
necessarily
a
cut
and
dried
right
answer
to
that
balance,
although
there
certainly
would
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
situation
that
you
have
put
forward.
i
can't
imagine
that
the
department
of
transportation
would
not
conclude
that
that
is
deceptive
and
therefore
act--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
again,
we
agree
with
the
airline
that
it,
that
read
as
a
whole
it
can
be
read
more
narrowly
than
the
ordering
paragraph.
if
the
ordering
paragraph
alone
is
the
focus
of
the
court's
attention,
we
think
that
the
only
part
of
it
which
is
problematic
is
the
part
that
follows
fair
advertising.
there
is
talk
about
other
operations
involving
rates,
routes,
or
services.
we
don't
believe
that
that,
that
the
issue
is
so
broad
as
the
ordering
paragraph
indicates.
but
certainly
state
laws
that
restrict
the
content
and
form
of
airfare
advertising
are
preempted,
and
we
understand
the
ordering
paragraph
to
be
entirely
consistent
with
that.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
again
it's
our
position
that
read
as
a
whole
the
order
captures
the
more
limited
meaning.
we
would
not
oppose
a
remand,
but
we
believe
that
the
order
is
adequate
read
as
a
whole.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
let
me
suggest
that
we
take
erisa
as
a
starting
point.
in
erisa
the
court
has
said
reference
to
or
connection
with
equals
relates
to.
now,
the
court
has
also
recognized
that
every
conceivable
relationship
is
not
sufficient.
in
a
footnote
in
the
shaw
v.
delta
airlines
case
the
court
said
that
there
may
not
be
preemption
when
a
law
affects
benefit
plans
in
a
way
that
is,
quote,
too
tenuous,
remote,
or
peripheral
to
justify
preemption.
so
that
the
application
of
a
state
law
that
says
the
bad
faith
denial
of
benefits
is
preempted,
even
though
that
is
just
an
application
of
a
general
state
law
that
says
bad
faith
breeches
of
contract
are
actionable,
it
is
preempted
when
applied
to
an
erisa
benefit
plan.
whereas
the
application
of
a
garnishment
statute
is
not
preempted
because
that
is
just
too
peripheral,
too
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
act,
in
this
case
the
fostering
of
a
pro-competitive
environment,
opening
up
a
market
and
preserving
space
for
the
pro-competitive
policies
of
the
department
of
transportation.
