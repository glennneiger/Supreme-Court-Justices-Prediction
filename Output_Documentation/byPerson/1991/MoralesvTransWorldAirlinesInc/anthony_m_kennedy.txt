justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
texas
or
some
other
state
had
passed
a
statute
containing
all
of
the
prohibitions
and
guidelines
set
forth
in
the
guidelines
that
you
issued
here.
would
that
statute
be
valid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
have
to
take
that
position,
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
troubled
about
what,
the
same
thing
justice
o'connor
asked
you.
it's
really
quite
difficult
to
say,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
guidelines
issued
here
do
not
relate
to
airline
rates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
order
to
test
that
proposition
i
think
we're
entitled
to
inquire
as
to
how
far
your
principle
leads,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
simply
must
take
the
position
that
a
state
could
enact
a
statute
which
incorporated
all
of
the
guidelines
that
the
attorney
generals'
association
issued
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
8(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
get
to
the
jury
until
you
have
a
valid
state
enforcement
proceeding,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
must
be
that
california
can
require
one
size
of
type
on
airline
advertisings,
that
texas
can
require
another
size
of
type,
and
that
arizona
can
require
a
third
type
of
type
with
an
added
disclosure,
and
that
every
one
of
those
state
statutes
would
be
valid
as
a
state
enforcement
of
its
laws
against
deceptive
practices.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
has
to
be
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
state
laws
contain
the
provisions
that
i
have
hypothesized
were
enacted,
would
they
or
would
they
not
be
preempted
under
the
existing
federal
statutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
if
they,
they
would
not
be
preempted
then
you
would
have
to
say
that
that
is
not
a
law
affecting
airline
rates
and
routes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
state
attorney
generals
felt
there
was
a
need
for
uniformity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
support
the
affirmance
of
the
injunction
as
written
and
issued
by
the
court
below?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
a
remand
is
necessary?
