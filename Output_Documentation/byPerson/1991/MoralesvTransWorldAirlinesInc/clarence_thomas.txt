i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question,
counsel.
you
say
you're
not
enforcing
the
naag
guidelines?
justice
clarence
thomas
if
you
take
the
joint
appendix
to
page
137a,
the
second
paragraph
of
the
letter
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
transportation,
it
says
in
short
we
continue
to
support
and
intend
to
enforce
the
naag
guidelines
which
we
adopted
last
december.
that
seems
to
undermine
what
you
just
said.
justice
clarence
thomas
i
understand
that,
but
that's
also
part
of
the
record
in
the
motion
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
