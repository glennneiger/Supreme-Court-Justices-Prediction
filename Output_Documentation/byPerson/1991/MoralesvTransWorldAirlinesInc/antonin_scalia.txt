justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
goes
even
further
than
that,
as
i
understand
it.
you
would
also
say,
i
assume,
that
the
state
could
forbid
the
advertising
of
airline
tickets.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
relates
to
advertising.
it
doesn't
relate
to
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
even
though
it
only
relates
to
advertising
and
does
not
relate
to
rates?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
abandon
your
argument
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
does
not
relate
to
rates
is
dispositive
of
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
going
to
take
that
position
you
must
abandon
the
argument
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
relates
to
advertising
demonstrates
that
it
does
not
relate
to
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
relate
to
advertising
and
relate
to
rates
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
relates
to
advertising.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
acknowledge
that
that
two
step
bootstrapping
argument
is
valid
with
respect
to
a
law
that
prohibits
the
advertising
of
airfares.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
you
don't?
so
they
can
pass
such
a
law?
i
mean,
either
they
can
or
they
can't.
if
they
can't,
then
you
have
to
abandon
your
relates
to
rates
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
aside
from
the
first
amendment,
what
is
your
position
on
a
state
law
that
says
no
airline
rates
shall
be
advertised?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
states,
after
the
act
was
passed,
regulate
intrastate
carriage
by
airlines?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
the
act
goes
beyond
merely
undoing
what
the
cab
had
been
doing,
because
when
the
cab
was
in
effect
the
cab
regulated
interstate
fares
and
the
states
were
entitled
to
regulate
intrastate
fares,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
new
act
says
no
regulation
of
intrastate
fares.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
want
a
competitive
regime,
which
is
consonant
with
the
notion
that
they
wanted
competitive
advertising
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
true
is,
as
the
government
points
out,
that
if
you're
practically
disempowered
from
advertising
because
you
are
compelled
to
include
within
your
notice
all
of
the
exceptions
that
may
exist
on
various
routes,
you
as
a
practical
matter
can't
have
any
advertising.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
state
law
could
do
that,
i
suppose.
is
there
any
objection
to
state
law
saying
you
must
put
in
any
of
your
advertising
all
of
the
exceptions
to
the
fares
that
you
announce,
you
can't
say
some
exceptions
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
up
to
the
state.
if
it's
state
law,
the
state
can
determine
what's
deceptive.
if
the
state
wants
to
say
you're
always
deceptive
in
an
ad
unless
you
list
all
of
the
exceptions
to
the
price
that
you
state,
if
the
state
wants
to
say
that's
deceptive
it
can,
i
presume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
trying
to
see
where
your
principle
leads.
it
may
well
be
that
in
the
particular
instance
it's
a
very
reasonable
thing
you're
saying,
and
something
that
the
department
of
transportation
will
agree
to,
but
doesn't
it
lead
you
all
the
way
to
the
point
where
you
can,
if
you
wish
and
if
we
accept
your
argument
here,
you
can
say
effectively
there
will
be
no
airline
advertising,
by
simply
saying
you
must
list
every
exception
to
any
fare
that
you
advertise?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you've
just
waved
a
stick.
i
mean,
even
if
you're
correct
that
these
rules
adopted
by
the
association
of
state
attorneys
general,
or
whatever
the
organization
is
that
adopted
them,
haven't
been
applied
in
this
case,
they
were
certainly
brandished
against
the
airlines.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
one
thing
to
say
they're
not
involved
in
this
case
and
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
the
airlines
haven't
been
affected
by
any
such
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
consumer
protection
laws
as
they
apply
to
the
sale
of
tickets,
never
mind
advertising?
i
mean,
that's
as
closely
connected
to
rates,
i
suppose,
as
the
advertising
of
them.
fraud
in
the
sale
of
tickets
can't
be
prosecuted
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
problem
that
i
see
in
your
argument,
mr.
jones,
that
your
theory
does
not
accord
with
the
statutory
text
that
you're
using
to
implement
it.
what
you're
objecting
to
is
interference,
or
any
state
law
that
interferes
effectively
with
competition,
which
was
the
goal
of
the
statute,
competition
in
rates
and
the
other
matters.
but
the
text
does
not
suit
that
kind
of
a
reasoning.
the
text
seems
to
carve
out
categories
of
state
law
without
looking
at
their
particularized
effect.
it's
any
relating
to
this
matter,
not
that
has
a
significant
enough
effect
upon
this
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
one
of
those
ads
is
seriously
misleading,
not
in
one
of
the
ways
set
forth
in
the
guidelines,
but
it
just
lies.
it
says
the
fare
will
be
300
dollars
and
it's
actually,
or
100
dollars
and
it's
actually
300
dollars?
is
there
no
remedy
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
problem
with
the
guidelines
is
that
they
use
tort
law
instead
of
contract
law?
they
should
simply
have
said
anyone
who
does
not
list
all
of
the
exceptions
to
the
fare
shall
be
deemed
to
have
no
exception
to
it,
and
anyone
who
accepts
such
an
offer
shall
be
deemed
to
have
a
contract
with
no
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
just
the
guidelines?
if
we
assume
that
only
the
guidelines
are
at
issue
do
you
say
that
there's
not
enough
record
with
respect
to
that
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
when
congress
regulated
the
airline
industry
in
the
late
1970s
it
added
a
preemption
provision
to
prevent
the
state
from
simply
replacing
the
old
federal
regulation
with
a
regulation
of
their
own.
that
provision
prohibits
the
states
from
enforcing
any
law
"relating
to
air
carrier's
rates,
routes,
or
services".
the
issue
here
is
the
meaning
of
this
phrase.
the
national
association
of
attorneys
general
have
adapted
guidelines
containing
detailed
standards
governing
the
content
and
format
of
airline
advertising,
frequent
flier
programs,
and
other
airline
industry
practices.
when
the
attorney
general
of
texas
sent
a
letter
to
several
airlines
threatening
to
enforce
the
fare
advertising
provisions
of
these
guidelines,
the
airlines
filed
this
suit
claiming
that
the
fare
advertising
portions
are
preempted
and
requesting
an
injunction
against
texas
enforcement
of
them.
the
district
court
agreed
that
those
portions
of
the
guidelines
are
preempted
and
it
enjoined
texas
not
only
form
enforcing
the
fare
advertising
guidelines
but
also
from
taking
"any
enforcement
action"
which
would
regulate
or
restrict
"any
aspect
of
the
airline's
operations
relating
to
rates,
routes,
or
services".
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
judgment.
as
an
initial
matter,
the
injunction
has
to
be
vacated
in
so
far
as
it
restrains
the
operation
of
texas'
laws
with
respect
to
matters
other
than
the
fare
advertising
portions
of
the
guidelines.
basic
principles
of
equity
dictate
that
an
injunction
cannot
issue
unless
the
moving
party
is
actually
threatened
with
the
irreparable
injury
and
has
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
texas
has
never
threatened
to
interfere
with
the
airline's
operations
except
with
respect
to
those
portions
of
that
guidelines
dealing
with
fare
advertising.
but
as
to
those
portions,
we
do
agree
that
they
relate
to
rates
and
are
preempted
and
that
texas'
threatened
enforcement
of
them
should
be
enjoined.
the
key
in
our
view
is
that
congress
preempted
state
laws
"relating
to
rates",
and
as
we
have
repeatedly
recognized
in
our
cases
interpreting
the
similarly
worded
provision
of
erisa,
the
employees
retirement
insurance
security
act,
that
phrase
relates
to
expresses
a
far
broader
preemptive
purpose.
transposing
into
this
case,
our
construction
of
that
same
phrase
in
the
erisa
cases
state
laws
having
a
connection
with
or
reference
to
airline
rates
are
preempted
even
if
they
do
not
formally
prescribe
the
rates
airlines
may
charge.
it
is
clear
that
the
fare
advertising
guidelines
have
a
reference
to
airline
rates,
each
one
of
them
specifically
mentions
them.
it
is
also
clear
that
they
have
a
connection
with
airline
fares
in
the
sense
of
affecting
them.
collectively,
they
establish
binding
requirements
as
to
how
tickets
may
be
marketed
if
they
are
to
be
sold
at
given
prices.
as
an
economic
matter,
their
compelled
disclosures
and
restrictions
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
airline's
ability
to
market
their
product
and
hence,
on
what
fares
the
airlines
would
be
able
to
charge.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
so
far
as
it
pertains
to
the
guidelines
restricting
fare
advertising.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
