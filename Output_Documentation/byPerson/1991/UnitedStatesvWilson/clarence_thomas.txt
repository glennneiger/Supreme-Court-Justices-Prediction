justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
respondent,
richard
wilson
committed
extortion
and
other
crimes
in
tennessee.
state
authorities
arrested
wilson
and
held
him
in
jail
pending
the
outcome
of
simultaneous
state
and
federal
prosecutions.
the
united
states
district
court
eventually
gave
wilson
a
96-month
sentence.
wilson
appealed
to
the
sentence
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
arguing
that
the
district
court
should
have
given
him
credit
for
the
time
that
he
spent
in
state
jail.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
wilson
and
reversed
the
district
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk's
office,
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
a
federal
prisoner
has
a
right
to
receive
credit
for
certain
pre-sentenced
jail
time
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3585(b).
we
conclude,
however,
that
a
district
court
may
not
award
this
credit
at
sentencing.
section
3585(b)
gives
a
defendant
a
right
to
credit
for
"any
time
that
he
has
spent
in
official
detention
before
his
sentence
begins".
calculation
of
this
credit
cannot
occur
at
sentencing
because
a
defendant's
total
detention
time
remains
unknown
until
he
actually
goes
to
prison.
in
our
review,
the
credit
must
be
determined
as
an
administrative
matter
once
the
defendant
begins
to
serve
his
sentence.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
white
has
joined.
