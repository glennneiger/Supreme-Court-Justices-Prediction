justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
pause
you
right
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
always
going
to
be
the
case,
even
if
the
judge
does
it?
he's
got
to
impose
a
sentence
and
then
he's
got
to
say,
well,
now
we've
got
to
figure
out
how
much
credit
the
man
is
entitled
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
couldn't
do
it
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
did
it
before,
you
wouldn't
know
when
the
sentence
was
going
to
be
imposed,
so
that
there
would
be
the
same
argument
about
not
knowing
when
he
is
going
to
arrive
at
the
jail,
or
the
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is
you
don't
identify
the
person
in
the
present
statute.
what's
wrong
with
reading
the
statute
this
way?
the
statute
requires
that
somebody
make
this
calculation,
that
at
the
sentencing
time,
the
judge
just
says,
is
there
going
to
be
any
fight
about
the
credit
time.
and
if
everybody
says
no,
it's
all,
you've
just
got
so
much
time
in
jail,
then
he
could
say
to
the
attorney,
well,
you
go
ahead
and
compute
it,
then,
and
we'll
enter
the
sentence
plus
whatever
time
you...
couldn't
he
delegate
that
authority
in
cases
when
there's
no
dispute
under
your
opponent's
reading
of
the
statute?
and
then
just
say,
if
there
is
a
dispute,
i
ought
to
resolve
it.
it
shouldn't
be
resolved...
while
lawyers
are
here
to
write
it
out,
it
shouldn't
be
resolved
in
the
prison
setting.
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
the
judge
simply
say
i
want
you
to
give
credit
for
what's
happened
up
to
now,
plus
whatever
time
it
takes
to
get
him
to
prison.
the
exact
number
of
days
to
be
set
by
the
attorney
general
after
everything
has
taken
place.
and
so
that
all
the
issues
are
resolved
in
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
going
to
be
rules
on
which
the
government's
interest
will
be
different
from
the
defendant's
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
should
they
be
therefore
resolved
by
a
neutral
arbitrator
or
by
the
attorney
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
prisoner
disagrees
with
you,
the
burden
would
be
with
him
after
he's
no
longer
got
a
lawyer,
he's
now
in
jail,
to
come
in
and
make
an
appropriate
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
prevail
unless
he
got
to
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
it
better
just
to
get
it
resolved
right
at
the
time
of
sentencing?
most
of
these
issues,
certainly,
can
be...
you
can
tell
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
fight
about
it,
can't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
isn't
the
controversy
very
rare?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
did
this
all
happen
before
or
after
the
federal
sentencing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
talking
about
your
hypothetical
example,
or
the
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
why
wouldn't
that
case
be
taken
care
of
by
a
sentencing
order
that
said
he's
entitled
to
x
days
of
credit
up
to
now
plus
any
additional
credit
that
may
accrue
for
the
reasons
such
as
you
describe
as
to
be
computed
in
the
first
instance
by
the
attorney
general?
couldn't
the
judge
delegate
to
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
make
calculations
in
those
cases
where
they
depend
on
subsequent
events?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
that
be
consistent
with
the
statute?
and
why...
and
how
would
it
hurt
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
the
court
also
resolve
disputes
when
there
are...
there
are
legitimate
disputes
on
occasion
as
to
whether
certain
kinds
of
custody
would
count
or
not,
aren't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's...
i
still
don't
understand.
if
those
disputes
involve
something
that's
already
occurred,
why
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
to
have
the
judge
resolve
those
disputes
right
then?
and
then
just
say
any
additional
calculation,
like
telling
the
clerk
to
calculate
costs,
the
judges
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
on
cost,
but
this
isn't...
it
seems
to
me
that
99
percent
of
the
time
it
would
be
a
calculation
about
as
difficult
as
costs
in
the
normal
case.
and
you
just
say
costs
to
be
calculated
by
the
clerk,
future
credit
to
be
calculated
by
the
attorney
general.
i
just
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that
kind
of
a
simple
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
vague.
they
just
said
somebody's...
the
statute
is
vague
as
to
who
does
it.
and
most
things
at
the
end
of
a
trial,
the
judge
says,
are
there
any
loose
ends?
what's
left?
do
i
need
to
resolve
any,
you
know,
tag
ends
at
the
end?
decide
it
while
the
lawyers
are
still
there.
the
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
view
is
there
will
be
cases
where
there
are
legitimate
arguments
on
both
sides
and
the
defendant
no
longer
has
his
lawyer
right
at
hand
to
get
it
straightened
out
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
nothing
elaborate
about
the
system.
don't
exaggerate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suggested
one
to
you.
one
is
that
if
there
are
disputes,
let
the
judge
resolve
them.
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
normal
and
rational
answer
to
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
not
entirely
clear,
because
i
think
sometimes
you
didn't
quite
complete
your
answers
before,
but
how
do
you
handle
the
case
in
which
after
the
trial
judge
imposes
the
sentence,
there's
an
appeal
and
the
defendant
is
out
on
bond.
and
say
a
year
or
so
goes
by.
and
during
that
year,
the
question
arises
to
whether
some
jail
time
should
be
credited
or
not.
how
do
you
handle
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
say
it
doesn't.
there's
no
order
to
resentence,
they
just
affirm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
that
takes
care
of
the
case
where
he
gets
additional
credit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
event
that
transpires
in
the
interval
is
one
that
makes
it
clear
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
credit
that
he
might
have
been
entitled
to?
in
other
words,
say
that
you
don't
know
whether
the
state
was
going
give
him
credit
for
some
time
in
custody,
but
you
find
out
during
this
interim.
what
do
you
do
about
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
you
don't
have
a
federal
answer
to
that
question
under
your
approach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
would
it
be
error
for
the
judge
to
say
as
of
today
it
appears
that
this
is
the
credit
that's
warranted.
but
there
is
an
issue
that
can't
be
resolved
until
after
the
appeal
process
transpires.
i
therefore
order
the
attorney
general
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
to
make
the
appropriate
disposition
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
could
he
delegate...
could
the
judge
delegate
the
decisionmaking
authority
for
these
small
category
of
cases
to
the
attorney
general
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
intervening
events?
would
that
be
inconsistent
with
the
statute
in
any
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
most
of
the
time
those
delays
won't
result
in
any
additional
credit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
sometimes
would,
i
understand.
but
most
the
time
they
wouldn't.
would
that
be
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
in
those
cases
where
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
sentencing,
it
at
least
explains...
it
leaves
unexplained
why
the
phraseology
is
for
any
time
he
has
spent
in
official
detention
prior
to
the
date
the
sentence
commences.
