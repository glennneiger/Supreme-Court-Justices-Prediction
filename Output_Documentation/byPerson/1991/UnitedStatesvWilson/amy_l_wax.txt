ms.
amy
l.
wax
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
sentencing
credit
statute
codified
at
18
u.s.c.
3585,
which
congress
enacted
as
part
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
credit
against
a
federal
sentence
for
certain
periods
he
has
spent
in
official
detention
before
he
begins
to
serve
his
sentence.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
task
of
determining
the
amount
of
credit
that
is
due
against
a
defendant's
sentence,
that
is
the
technical
calculation
of
the
precise
number
of
days
the
defendant
has
left
to
serve
on
his
sentence,
is
to
be
performed
by
the
district
court
at
sentencing
or
by
the
attorney
general
through
the
bureau
of
prisons
once
the
sentence
begins.
here
the
district
court
refused
to
award
respondent
credit
against
his
8-year
federal
sentence
for
approximately
14
months
that
he
spent
in
state
custody
before
his
sentencing.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
that
decision,
holding
that
the
award
of
sentencing
credit
under
the
1984
statute
is
the
exclusive
province
of
the
sentencing
court,
which
is
to
assign
the
credit
at
sentencing.
although
respondent
received
credit
for
virtually
the
same
period
against
a
subsequent
state
sentence
after
he
was
sentenced
in
federal
court,
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
directed
the
district
court
to
give
him
credit
for
that
period
against
his
federal
sentence
as
well.
in
effect,
the
court
ruled
that
not
only
must
the
sentencing
court
decide
what
sentence
to
give
the
offender,
but
it
must
also
take
on
what
is
essentially
an
administrative
ministerial
function.
that
is
the
arithmetical
task
of
figuring
out
the
exact
date
an
offender
will
finish
serving
his
sentence.
in
the
government's
view,
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
to
conclude
that
the
statute
makes
this
task
part
of
sentencing,
that
is
a
function
to
be
performed
exclusively
by
the
sentencing
court.
it
is
the
bureau
of
prisons,
and
not
the
sentencing
court,
that
has
exclusive
authority
to
calculate
sentencing
credit,
a
function
that
bop
has
carried
out
for
25
years.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
decided
to
change
the
status
quo
and
to
discard
the
preexisting
administrative
framework
in
the
sentencing
reform
act.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
did,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
it
did
is
something
of
a
mystery.
we
think
the
common
sense
explanation
is
that
the
bop's
role
in
this
regard
was
so
well-entrenched,
they'd
been
doing
it
for
so
long,
that
congress
did
not
advert
to
the
question
of
who
is
to
perform
the
function,
they
just
assumed
that
bop
would.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
this
court
has
stated
that
a
change
in
language
is
just
some
evidence
of
a
change
in
meaning.
it
is
not
dispositive
of
an
intent
to
change
meaning.
and
this
court
most
recently
noted
in
mcelroy
v.
united
states,
where
it
found
that
a
change
in
language
did
not
betoken
a
change
in
meaning.
it
said
the
inference
from
a
change
in
language
to
a
change
in
intent
is
only
a
workable
rule
of
construction.
it
is
not
an
infallible
guide
to
legislative
intent,
and
it
cannot
overcome
more
persuasive
evidence.
and
the
government's
point
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
more
persuasive
evidence.
there
is
an
abundance
of
evidence
in
the
language,
the
history,
the
purposes
of
the
sentencing
credit
provision.
in
particular,
in
the
sentence
reform
act
as
a
whole,
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
alter
the
status
quo
that
it
did
not
transfer
authority
from
bop
to
the
sentencing
court.
and
just
to
begin,
there
are
three
specific
features
of
section
3585
itself
that
support
our
view.
and
just
to
summarize
them,
first
of
all,
the
statute
uses
the
past
tense
in
a
way
that
indicates
that
the
award
of
sentencing
credit
is
to
take
place
some
time
after
sentencing.
the
second
aspect
of
the
statute
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor,
that's
respondent's
point.
one
second
after
the
sentence
the
credit
can
be
given,
but...
yes?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
theoretically
you
could
do
it
before
you
pronounce
sentence,
but--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
we
think
that
our
view
has
support
from
the
history
of
this
statute.
the
predecessor
provision,
section
3568,
that's
where
this
language,
this
phrasing,
is
borrowed
from.
it's
lifted
right
from
3568.
now
under
3568,
that
statute
explicitly
said
that
the
attorney
general
awards
credit.
and
therefore,
we
take
the
parallel
language
to
essentially
have
the
same
significance
as
it
had
under
the
predecessor,
which
is
that
there's
sentencing,
and
then
when
the
person
begins
to
serve
his
sentence,
there's
an
assignment
of
credit.
we
think
the
parallelism
is
what's
appropriate.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
and
this
is
really
central
to
our
argument,
is
that
there
are
going
to
be
periods
of
detention,
periods
of
custody,
that
come
after
the
imposition
of
sentence.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
there
is
no...
the
courts
are
not--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but
all
the
issues
can't
be
resolved
in
court.
that's
our
point.
let
me
give
an
example
to
illustrate
that.
and
i'm
taking
the
example...
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
there
are
going
to
be
questions
about
interpreting
the
rules
for
giving
sentencing
credit
that
are
going
to
need
to
be
resolved
after
sentencing
by
someone...
an
administrator,
whoever.
there's
going
to
have
to
an
application
of
specific
facts
to
rules.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
the
attorney
general
resolves
them
by
applying
rules
that
he
has
formulated
and
that
are
open
for
scrutiny...
technical
rules.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
the
government
wouldn't
oppose
it
in
the
way
they
would
oppose
it
in
front
of
a
court.
bop
would
have
a
certain
view
of
the
way
in
which
credit
should
or
should
not
be
given
for
certain--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
but
the
point
is
that
an
individual
can
challenge
the
bop's
view
through
the
grievance
procedure
before
the
bureau
of
prisons
up
through
three
levels
of
review,
and
then
they
can
take
a
2241
motion
to
the
court.
it's
not
as
if
they
can't
get
to
court
on
this.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
as
a
numerical
matter,
yes,
most
of
sentencing...
most,
but
not
all.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it's
not
very
rare,
your
honor.
let
me
give
the
example
i
was
going
to
give.
there's
an
appeals
court
case
we
site
in
our
reply
brief,
blumgren
v.
belasky.
in
that
case,
an
individual
was
sentenced
for
a
federal
violation.
he
was
sent
out
on
an
appeal
bond.
he
was
arrested
some
time
later
by
state
authorities.
his
appeal
bond
was
revoked,
a
detainer
was
filed
by
federal
authorities,
but
he
remained
in
state
custody.
in
fact,
he
remained
and
wasn't
sent
out
on
bail
because
there
was
a
detainer,
for
a
number
of
months...
i
think
4
or
5
months...
before
the
state
charges
were
finally
dropped
and
he
was
turned
over
to
the
federal
authorities,
and
his
sentencing
clock
began
to
run.
now
under
the
statute,
he
would
be
entitled,
under
bop's
interpretation,
to
credit
for
the
number
of
months
that
he
spent
in
state
custody.
if
he'd
been
convicted
on
the
state
charges,
and
the
state
had
given
him
credit
for
that
time,
he
wouldn't
be.
so
there
are
all
sorts
of
eventualities--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
actually
this
respondent
was
in
state
custody
for
2
weeks--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--my
hypothetical...
all
of
this
happened
after
federal
sentencing
while
the
individual
was
on
an
appeal.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
there
are
other
scenarios
where
individuals
can
be
borrowed
from
state
custody
for
federal
sentencing
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum,
and
then
they
have
to
be
returned
to
the
state,
perhaps
to
stand
trial
or
to
serve
a
state
sentence.
weeks,
months,
and
even
years
can
intervene
between
the
imposition
of
sentence
by
federal
court,
and
the
beginning
of
service
of
that
sentence.
causey
v.
civiletti,
another
appeals
court
case
in
our
reply
brief,
illustrates
that
where
an
individual
served
a
state
sentence
before
his
federal
sentence.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
situations.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
congress
couldn't
have
created
that
system.
we're
only
saying
they
didn't--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--you're
right
that
if
that
was
the
system,
then
it
would
be
possible
to
take
into
account
intervening
detention,
so
to
speak.
but
what
we're
doing
here
in
this
case
is
we're
trying
to
divine
congressional
intent.
the
question
we're
trying
to
answer
is
what
was
the
system
congress
created,
not
what
is
the
system
congress
could
have
created.
our
argument...
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
essentially
a
system
of
shared
jurisdiction
over
sentencing,
because
in
effect
the
court
can
calculate
to
a
date
certain
the
amount
of
credit
due
for
anything
that
goes
before
sentencing,
but
it
can't
do
anything
like
that
for
a
period
that
comes
after
sentencing.
in
effect,
it
has
to
designate
the
attorney
general
to
do
that
for
it.
and
so
essentially
you're
saying
that
there's
a
kind
of
concurrent
or
shared
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
did
congress
create
a
system
of
shared
jurisdiction
knowing
that
there
was
a
perfectly
workable,
perfectly
adequate,
efficient,
uncomplicated
system
that
came
before?
essentially
what
you're
saying
is
they
threw
that
all
over.
they
completely
restructured
the
system,
and
they
didn't
give
us
one
iota
of
guidance
as
to
how
the
system
was
actually
going
to
work.
for
example,
can
bop
revise
the
determination
that
the
court
makes?
what
are...
how
do
we
resolve
some
of
the
jurisdictional
issues
that
come
up
when
you
have
a
shared
system?
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
state
statutes,
interestingly
enough,
and
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
do
allocate
responsibility
for
presentence
time
to
the
court,
sentencing
credit,
and
postsentence
time
to
the
correctional
authorities.
a
lot...
this
is
spelled
out
in
explicit
detail.
i
mean
this
is...
it's
nothing
like
this
statute
which
just
uses
the
passive
voice,
doesn't
give
us
a
hint
that
there
are
to
be
two
entities
instead
of
one.
and
even
respondent
concedes
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
this
complicated,
redundant,
inefficient
system
when
it
already
had
a
perfectly
good
and
workable
one.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor,
because
of--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we're
fighting--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we're
fighting
about
what's
going
to
happen
in
practice
when
the
courts
try
to
put
into
effect
this
system.
are
some
courts
going
to
rule
that
the
bop
can
revise?
are
other
courts
going
to
rule
that
they
can't
revise?
essentially,
we're
going
from
order
to
disorder,
at
least
for
a
little
while.
and
what
we're
saying
is
congress
did
not
want
to
go
from
order
and
uniformity
to
disorder.
and
that's
the
inference.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
is.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly,
your
honor.
then
it
just
becomes
an
empty
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
court
and
we
just
don't
see
the
point.
and
the
legality
of
it
would
be
in
doubt
as
well.
i
mean
that
system,
i
don't
think,
is
a
workable
one.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it's
impossible
for
the
district
court
to
know
about
it
at
all.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
does,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
is
that
if
the
district
courts
are
making
a
determination
for
matters
that
are
within
its
knowledge,
we
will
still
see
different
district
courts
perhaps
giving
credit
to
similarly
situated
offenders
in
different
ways.
another
of
our
arguments
is
that
we
do
not
think
it's
right
to
attribute
to
congress
the
intent
to
go
from
a
system
of
uniform
national
guidelines
where
bop
had
worked
out
a
set
of
rules
for
rather
some
complicated
scenarios
that
can
arise.
to
go
from
that
system,
which
was
working
perfectly
well,
to
one
in
which
every
court
would
reinvent
the
wheel
on
its
own
and
have
to
decide
how
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
come
up
in
sentencing
credit...
and
what
that
would
do
is
it
would
subvert
the
purposes
of
sentencing
reform
generally,
which
is
to
have
similarly
situated
offenders
treated
alike.
now
why
would
congress
want
to
go,
as
i
said,
from
order
to
disorder,
even
if
it's
only
temporary
disorder?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
initially
the
individual
has
to
go
through
the
bureau
of
prisons'
grievance
process,
through
three
levels.
and
if
he's
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
that,
then
he
can
seek
review
or
take
a...
i
think
the
commonest
mechanism
is
to
take
a...
to
make
a
motion
under
section
2241,
a
habeas
motion,
challenging
the
bureau
of
prisons'
or
the
attorney
general's
right
to
keep
him
in
custody
longer
rather
than
less
time,
which
is
the
time
that
he
thinks
that
he
should
be
in
custody.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
rule
35
would
only
be
available
for
an
appeal
of
a
sentence,
a
sentence
as
such.
and
our...
under
our
theory,
if
credit
is
given
by
bureau
of
prisons,
it's
not
part
of
the
sentence.
and
in
fact,
it
isn't
part
of
the
sentence,
of
course,
conceptually
it's
completely
different
from
the
sentence.
the
sentence
is
saying
how
long
you're
going
to
be
in
prison
overall.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
it
refers
not
to
how
many
days
you
have
to
tick
off
in
the
future
given
what
you've
served
in
the
past,
but
how
much
time
you're
going
to
be
in
prison
overall.
what
the
length
of
your
prison
term
is
going
to
be.
that's
what
a
court
does.
the
court
passes
sentence.
it
metes
out
punishment.
and
this
is
really
a
separate--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--oh,
yes,
there
are
disputes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
in
the
abstract,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
the
question...
and
as
i
said,
congress
could
have
made
it
that
way.
the
question
is
did
they?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
can
be
said
about
a
lot
of
disputes.
i
mean,
our
point
about
this...
first
of
all,
our
main
point,
and
i'll
repeat
it,
is
that
what
this
court
is
here
to
do
is
to
conduct
an
exercise
in
divining
congressional
intent.
and
we
have
to
do
that
from
the
clues
that
are
at
our
disposal.
and
the
clues
at
our
disposal
include
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
our
assessment
of
how
the
statute
is
going
to
work
in
practice
under
various
schemes
that
congress
could
have
created.
and
we
have
to
assess
those
in
light
of
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
in
the
sentencing
reform
act.
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
bring
rationality
and
uniformity
and
consistency
to
sentencing.
and
to
make
sure
that
similar
offenders
would
get
similar
sentences
and
serve
the
same
amount
of
time.
and
that
the
sentence
that
the
court
gives
would
be
the
one
that
was
served.
and
what
we're
saying
is
you
can't
look
at
those
purposes
and
then
infer
that
congress
wanted
to
create
this
elaborate
system
that
in
practice
would
subvert
those
purposes.
it's
more
elaborate--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
what
we're
saying
is,
just
to
say
it
perhaps
more
modestly,
is
that
congress
took
a
workable,
well-oiled
system,
one
that
it
had
never
complained
about...
there's
no
grumbling
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
legislative
history
about
it.
there's
no
hint
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it,
even
though
congress
complained
about
a
lot
of
other
things
in
sentencing
when
it
enacted
the
sentencing
reform
act.
and
they
changed
it.
now,
what
purpose
would
changing
it
serve?
i
can't
think
of
a
reason
why
congress
would
want
to
just
change
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but
the
bureau
of
prisons
was
resolving
them
and
resolving
them
in
a
way
that
afforded
administrative...
that
afforded
judicial
review
that
lifted
from
the
courts
the
burden
of
essentially
doing
a
bean-counting
operation,
one
that
could
get
complicated
perhaps,
at
times,
and
which
might
give
rise
to
disputes,
but
really
is
just
an
administrative
matter
of
applying
rules
to
facts,
finding
out
those
facts,
and
ticking
off
days.
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is
congress
took
something
that
was
being
done
perfectly
well
by
an
administrative
agency
and
sent
it
back
to
the
courts.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
attorney
general
language,
your
honor,
or
the
absence
of
the
attorney
general
language?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
there's
no
explanation
for...
i
don't
know
where
it...
when
it
appeared,
i
must
say.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
appears
to
have
been
overlooked,
your
honor,
unfortunately.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
well,
it
is
unfortunate
because
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
we
don't
understand
why
the
language
was
deleted,
but
we
would
just
speculate
that
it
was
an
entrenched
feature
and
nobody
thought
about
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
is,
your
honor.
and
whatever
weight
we
give
to
the
substance
of
legislative
history,
here
we
have
no
substance
at
all
because
nothing
was
said.
but
interestingly,
the
legislative
history
says
a
lot
about
section
3585
and
the
other
changes
that
were
introduced
into
section
3585.
the
change,
for
example...
the
expansion
of
the
scope
of
the
custody
for
which
credit
was
available,
for
example,
that
was
remarked
upon.
the
change
in
the
day
that
the
sentence
commences,
that
was
also
spoken
about.
the
fact
that
they
added
this
double
credit
language
which
hadn't
previously
appeared.
congress
commented
on
that,
too.
and
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
legislative
history
as
a
whole,
congress
goes
on
and
on
about
the
shortcomings
of
the
previous
way
of
doing
sentencing
and
all
of
the
ways
in
which
those
shortcomings
are
to
be
remedied.
and
we
have
nothing
about
shortcomings
at
all
here,
no
indication
that
there
was
a
problem
to
be
solved.
now,
respondent
has
several
arguments
against
our
position,
and
all
of
them
are
easily
answered.
the
main
thrust
of
his
argument
appears
to
be
that
in
sentencing
reform,
congress
somehow
wanted
to
place
all
decisions
bearing
on
the
length
of
the
sentence,
including
the
release
date,
in
the
hands
of
the
court
in
order
to
achieve
uniformity
and
consistency
in
sentencing.
now,
the
problem
with
this
argument
is
that
it
confuses
control
over
the
total
length
of
the
sentence
with
control
over
the
actual
release
date
of
an
individual
offender.
that
argument,
it
essentially
confuses
passing
sentence
with
deciding
how
much
of
the
sentence
is
left
to
serve.
it's
important
to
realize
that
having
the
sentencing
court
fix
the
actual
release
date
in
fact
subverts
rather
than
serves
the
goals
of
uniformity
and
consistency
in
sentencing.
now
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
the
release
date
is
fixed
at
sentencing,
we
necessarily
have
to
ignore
any
periods
of
detention
for
which
an
individual
would
be
eligible
for
credit
under
3585
that
come
after
sentencing.
because
if
we
take
those
periods
into
account,
by
definition
we're
going
to
be
moving
the
release
date.
now
if
we
don't
take
them
into
account,
it
means
that
similar
offenders
will
in
fact
spend
different
periods
of
time
in
jail
depending
on
whether
their
federal
sentence
starts
right
away
or
it
starts
after
a
period
of
detention
or
at
some
later
time.
and
it
means
that
the
court
will
not
be
able
to
control
the
amount
of
time
an
individual
spends
behind
bars
for
the
very
same
reason.
some
individuals
will
spend
an
intervening
period
of
detention
that
won't
have
any
effect
on
their
release
date
and
other
individuals
won't.
so
the
bottom
line
is
that
it's
impossible
for
a
court
to
fix
both
the
duration
of
the
sentence,
if
we
take
section
3585
and
sentencing
credit
seriously,
and
the
release
date.
congress
certainly,
i
think,
from
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
didn't
care
about
the
release
date.
it
cared
about
how
long
an
individual
was
going
to
be
behind
bars
for
that
offense.
and
that
means
that
we
have
to
change
the
release
date
to
account
for
intervening
detention.
ms.
amy

wax
your
honor,
he's
objecting
to
it
now.
ms.

wax
if
he
did,
your
honor--
ms.
amy

wax
--i
do
not

your

ms.
amy

it
might
be.
i'd
be
glad
to
try
and
find
it
out
for
you,
your
honor.
ms.
amy

wax
no,
i
think
we
should
assume
that
he
thought
that
the
statute--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no,
i
think
he
thought
that
as
it
stood
the
statute
continued
to
give
him
authority
to
make
this
determination.
and
that's
our
position
now.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
we
don't
know
that.
but
i
think
if
he
did
he
would
take
the
position
he's
taking
now.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
just
a
couple
of
quick
points.
first
of
all,
it's
very
important
to
realize
that
the
sentence
does
not
begin
in
the
federal
system
at
sentencing
and
a
delay
between
sentencing
and
the
advent
of
sentence
is
very,
very
common.
individuals
are
given
time
to
put
their
affairs
in
order,
or
they're
put
out
on
appeal
bonds.
they're
on
a
state
detainer.
they
were
in
state
custody
before
they
went
over
to
the
federal
side,
as
this
respondent
was.
delays
are
common
and
detention
can
occur.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
they
sometimes
will,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly,
your
honor.
my
second--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it
certainly
doesn't
fit
with
the
language
and
it
doesn't
fit
with
the
reality,
either.
my
second
point,
of
course,
is
that
respondent
does
concede
that
some
double
credit
awards
simply
will
not
be
corrected.
there
will
be
windfalls.
individuals,
who
through
an
accident
of
timing,
get
a
second
award
of
credit
by
the
state
after
sentencing
will
get
to
keep
it.
the
individuals
who
get
the
award
against
a
state
sentence
before
their
federal
sentencing
will
not
get
to
have
a
second
award.
that's
a
completely
arbitrary
result.
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
result,
which
goes
against
all
of
the
goals
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
and
my
third
point
is
respondent
makes
a
lot
out
of
the
possibility
of
putting
all
the
information
bearing
on
sentencing
credit
in
the
presentence
report.
if
you
read
the
sections
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
that
govern
what
goes
into
a
presentencing
report,
rule
32
section
3552,
not
a
word
is
said
about
you
need
to
find
these
facts
and
put
in
this
information
so
that
the
court
can
make
a
credit
determination.
not
a
word
is
said.
