and
he
would
also...
it
would
also
commence
later
if
he's
released
on
a
state
detainer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
if
he's
in
federal
custody,
he's
sentenced,
there's
a
state
detainer
against
him.
they
turn
him
over
to
the
state
for
the
state
trial
before
his
sentence
begins.
isn't
that
sometimes
done?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
could
be
cases
in
which
immediately
following
the
imposition
of
sentence,
instead
of
being
turned
over
to
the
marshals
for
transportation
to
a
federal
prison,
he's
turned
over
to
state
officials
for
transportation
to
some
state
courthouse
for
a
trial.
and
in
that
case
the
sentence
would
not
begin
until
the
state
trial
was
over
and
he
either
arrived
at
the
federal
prison
or
was
then
turned
over
to
the
marshals.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
just
saying
it's
unlikely.
it
could
happen,
but
it's
unlikely.
