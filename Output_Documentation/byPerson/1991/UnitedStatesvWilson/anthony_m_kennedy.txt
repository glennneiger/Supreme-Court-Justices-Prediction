do
you
take
the
position,
or
would
you
take
the
position
if
we
hold
that
the
district
judge
must
make
the
credit
determination
at
the
time
of
the
sentence
that
you
can
revise
an
inaccurate
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
so,
are
we
really
fighting
about
very
much,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
not
just
let
the
district
judge
do
whatever
he
wants
and
then
you
make
a
recalculation
to
make
sure
that
it's
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
suppose
there's
an
authoritative
determination
that
you
can
revise.
i
mean
correct
calculation
by
the
district
court.
in
effect,
then,
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
doing
everything,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
the
district
court
does
is
simply
something
that
can
be
overridden?
you
run
into
a
problem,
united
states
against
muskrat,
where
the
district
courts
can't
give...
can't
do
purely
advisory
work
if
it's
to
be
reviewed
by
some
nonjudicial
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
one
of
your
concerns
in
this
case
that
the
district
judge
should
have
before
it
the
credit
and
make
the
calculation
of
the
credit
so
that
the
judge
can
take
that
into
account
in
determining
the
base
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then,
defendants
are
being
treated
differently
because
if
there
is
a
credit
that
arises
by
reason
of
detentions
that
are
after
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
but
before
it
commences,
the
judge
can't
do
that,
so
then
you
are
imposing
on
us
a
regime
where
defendants
are
treated
differently,
which
is
precisely
what
the
congress
did
not
want.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
arbitrary
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
it,
because
it's
all
after
the
fact,
and
under
the
government's
position,
the
judge
would
be
encouraged
to
set
the
base
decision
without
reference
to
the
credit
time,
which
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
logical
design
of
the
statute
in
any
event.
and
under
your
system,
that
would
not
happen.
