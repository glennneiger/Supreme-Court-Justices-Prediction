mr.
henry
a.
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
do
agree
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
issue
is,
and
that
is
this
court
should
determine
what
congress
intended
for
the
determination
of
entitlement
of
jail
credits
under
the
new
act.
i
will,
before
i
begin
my
prepared
remarks,
try
to
answer
justice
white's
question.
we
reviewed
the
legislative
history,
at
least,
for
all
the
prior
versions
of
this
particular
statute
once
congress
began
to
consider
sentencing
reform.
i
can't
say
that
i've
reviewed
each
version
of
the
statute,
but
each
version
of
the
legislative
history
for
that
statute
is
the
same
as
the
legislative
history
for
the
current
statute.
it
would
appear
from
that
that
probably
prior
versions
of
this
section
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
were
the
same
as
the
current
section
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
which
is
now
law.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
i
don't
know
that.
the
legislative
history
was
the
same
for
the
original
version,
so
i
suspect
that
it
was.
i
had
not
reviewed
the
prior
versions
except
for
the
legislative
history
of
the
prior
versions.
and
there's
no
mention
in
the
legislative
history
on
those
prior
versions
of
the
attorney
general,
so
i'm
assuming
the
prior
versions
of
the
statute
were
the
same.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
i'm
sure
ms.
wax
and
i
both
will
be
more
than
happy
to
provide
supplemental
briefs.
the...
our
position,
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
congress
in
reforming
sentencing
in
federal
courts
intended
for
the
district
courts
to
make
a
determination
on
jail
credit
for
a
sentenced
individual.
it's
our
position
that
that
approach
is
not
only
more
logical
and
workable
than
the
approach
presented
by
the
attorney
general,
but
it
is
more
consistent
with
congressional
intent
as
expressed
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
the
enactment
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
i
think
in
order
to
understand
how
it's
more
logical
and
sensical,
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
can
relay
to
the
court
how
i
would
envision
this
operating
under
our
proposal
and
then
how
i
would
envision
this
operating
under
the
government's
proposal.
the
process
would
start
out
the
same
in
either
event.
an
individual
would
commit
an
offense,
there
would
be
an
arrest
by
somebody,
either
federal
or
state.
there
would
be
a
determination
as
to
detention
or
release
pretrial.
at
some
point
there
would
come
a
determination
appeal
to...
either
by
a
guilty
plea
or
by
condition
by
at
trial.
and
at
that
point
the
two
systems
would
begin
to
diverge.
under
the
proposal
that
we
have,
the
next
thing
that
would
occur
would
be
a
presentence
investigation
and
report
prepared
by
a
probation
officer
under
the
direction
of
the
court
with
the
assistance
and
involvement
of
both
parties,
both
the
defendant
and
the
united
states
attorney.
that
presentence
report
would
include
the
prior
record
of
the
individual,
including
any
pending
charges,
any
pending
sentences.
it
would
include
a
report
to
the
court
as
to
any
prior
incarceration
or
confinement
of
the
defendant,
whether
or
not
he
was
in
custody
for
any
or
all
the
portion
of
the
time
of
the
charge
until
disposition
of
the
case.
it
would
also
include
a
calculation
of
the
appropriate
guideline
sentence,
a
recommendation
of
what
the
guideline
sentence
should
be,
a
recommendation
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
any
grounds
for
departure
above
or
below
the
applicable
guideline
range.
and
under
our
proposal,
the
recommendation
also
as
to
what
amount
of
jail
credit
the
person
is
entitled
to,
and
if
there
are
other
sentences
pending
or
imposed
unserved,
a
recommendation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
current
sentence
should
be
concurrent
or
consecutive
to
any
prior
sentences.
at
that
point,
then,
this
presentence
report
would
be
distributed
to
the
parties.
if
there
was
any
objection
about
any
of
those
matters
in
the
presentence
report,
both
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
and
the
attorney
for
the
government
would
have
an
opportunity
to
notify
the
court
and
each
other
of
those
objection.
any
that
remained
contested
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
hearing
would
be
subjected
before
the
court
to
factfinding
to
the
presentation
of
witnesses
or
documents,
if
necessary,
by
argument
of
counsel,
and
ultimately
by
determination
by
the
court.
the
court
would
then
determine
what
the
applicable
guideline
range
is.
based
upon
that
guideline
range,
whether
or
not
a
sentence
of
probation
or
incarceration
was
appropriate,
whether
or
not
there
were
any
circumstances
indicated
a
departure
above
or
below
the
guidelines
was
appropriate.
it
would
then
determine
if
there's
going
to
be
incarceration--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
ma'am.
the
next
thing
the
court
would
do
would
then
turn
the
sentence
and
make
a
decision,
under
our
proposal,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
had
any
prior
jail
credit
that
should
come
off
of
that
sentence
and
also
decide
whether
it
is
concurrent
or
consecutive.
that
issue
then,
addressed
by
both
parties,
would
be
part
of
the
case
that
could
go
up
on
appeal.
so
there
would
be
a
final
determination
at
that
time
as
to
any
contested
issues,
entitlement
to
jail
credit.
once
that
matter
was
resolved
once
and
for
all,
the
person
would
go
off
and
serve
his
sentence.
under
the
attorney
general's
proposal
what
would
happen
is
the
district
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
would
determine
all
of
these
issues
except
for
jail
credit.
there
may
be
5
days
of
jail
credit
at
stake,
or
may,
as
in
this
case,
be
429
days
of
jail
credit
at
stake.
the
district
court
under
the
bureau
of
prisons'
approach,
and
the
government's
approach
would
not
make
any
determination
officially
as
to
what
impact
that
jail
credit
would
have.
it
would
decide
only
what
the
length
of
the
sentence
would
be.
the
person
would
then
go
off
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
if
it's
an
incarceration
sentence
for
a
determination
at
some
point
in
time
later
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
as
to
the
entitlement
to
jail
credit.
and
there
are
two
or
three
things
about
the
way
that
would
happen
that
i
think
make
it
clear
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
this
to
happen.
it's
going
to
occur
at
the
first
place,
let's
say,
in
some
remote
facility
from
the
district
of
conviction.
in
mr.
wilson's
case,
he's
incarcerated
at
marianna
prison
in
florida,
which
is
a
different
district
and
different
circuit
from
the
district
and
circuit
of
conviction.
it
would
also
occur
at
a
time...
at
a
place
and
in
a
point
remote
in
time
from
the
sentencing
process.
he
would
have
gone...
when
he
arrived
at
federal
custody,
he
would
have
initially
been
held
by
the
marshals
for
some
period
of
time,
awaiting
transportation,
would
have
then
been
in
transit
from
anywhere
from
weeks
to
months
before
he
arrived
at
the
institution
designated
by
the
bureau
of
prisons.
at
some
point
in
time
after
his
arrival
there,
he
would
have
a
meeting
with
a
staff
member
of
the
prison
who
would
make
an
initial
informal
decision.
if
he
was
unsatisfied
with
that,
it
would
then
go
to...
he
would
then
submit
a
written
complaint,
which
would
then
be
responded
to
by
the
warden
of
the
prison.
if
he
were
unsatisfied
with
that
determination,
he
would
then
go
to
the
regional
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
in
writing.
he
would
get
a
response
to
that.
if
he
were
dissatisfied
with
that
response,
he
would
then
go
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
in
writing,
for
a
response.
if
he
were
dissatisfied
at
that
point...
and
by
now
we're
probably
months,
if
not
a
year
from
his
arrival
in
federal
custody.
at
that
point,
he
would
then
initiate
litigation.
and
i
agree
with
ms.
wax
that
the
most
likely
form
of
that
litigation
would
be
an
action
under
2241,
a
habeas
corpus
action
challenging
the
execution
of
his
sentence.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
justice
scalia,
the
reason
that
i
think--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--yes,
sir.
the
answer,
i
think,
to
that
is
that
for
one
thing,
in
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
cases
before
the
district
court,
commencement
and
imposition
are
the
same
date.
commencement
of
the
sentence
will
begin
for
the
vast
majority
people
of
sentenced
in
the
federal
court
at
the
time
the
judge
bangs
the
gavel
down
because
at
that
point
he'll
order
the
person
into
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
and
at
that
point,
under
the
statute,
in
subsection
a
of
the
statute,
the
sentence
commences.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
i
would
agree
on
that
point
with
ms.
wax,
that
congress
may
have
been
an
little
inelegant.
in
the
legislative
history
for
that
rather
than
referring
to
commencement,
they
referred
to
imposition
of
sentence,
where
any
time
accrued
prior
to
imposition
of
sentence.
now
i
think
congress
at
that
point
was
making
no
distinction
between
imposition
of
sentence
and
commencement
of
sentence
because,
in
fact,
as
i
said
before,
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
those
are
the
same
date.
for
the
few
rare
cases
where
those
are
not
the
same
date,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
that
our
proposal
is
still
the
more
workable.
one
is
in
those
cases
where
the
difference,
the
gap
in
those
dates
works
to
the
potential
detriment
of
a
defendant
who
might
accrue
some
additional
entitlement
to
jail
credit
after
imposition
of
sentence,
2255
is
still
available,
or
2241,
whichever
is
the
appropriate
remedy,
to
restore
that
credit
to
the
individual.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir,
in
most
cases.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
in
most
cases,
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
coming
before
district
court,
the
person
is
either
going
to
be
not
in
custody--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--no,
sir,
that
was
my
colloquial
approach.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
no,
sir.
3585,
the
same
statute
we're
dealing
with
here,
subsection
a,
says
the
commencement
is
either
the
arrival
at
the
institution
or
the
arrival...
or
in
custody
of
united
states
marshals
for
transportation
to
the
institution.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir,
either
one.
in
most
cases,
it's
going
to
be
the
one
where
he's
in
custody
of
the
marshal
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentencing
hearing
when
the
judge
says,
mr.
marshal,
take
this
person
into
custody.
for
most
people,
that's
going
to
be
when
their
sentence
commences.
they're
either
already
in
federal
custody
if
they
were
detained
prior
to
trial,
as
an
increasing
number
of
defendants
are,
or
they
are
out
of
custody.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
if
the
person
is
not
in
custody
and
is
allowed
to
self-report
to
the
designated
institution,
which
happens
less
and
less
often,
then
the
sentence
would
commence
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
at
the
institution.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
if
he's
in
state
custody
and
a
federal
detainer?
i'm
sorry,
i
don't--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--that
could
happen,
and
what
would
probably
happen
under
those
circumstances,
if
he's
in
federal
custody,
if
he
was
released
at
some
point
to
the
state
on
a
writ,
it
would
be
only
for
the
purpose
of
judicial
proceeding
and
he
would
be
returned
back
to
federal
custody
to
continue
serving
his
sentence.
and
this
would
have
happened
after
he
had
commenced
his
sentence
in
any
event.
this
would
not
really
deal
with
the
custody.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
that
would
more
likely
occur
when
he's
already
in
state
custody
to
begin
with
and
he's
been
borrowed
under
writ
for
the
federal
court.
i
think
it's
less
likely
that
the
federal
court,
having
custody
of
him,
would
release
custody
for
anything
other
than
just
a
temporary...
i'm
not
saying
that
it
can't
happen.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
it's
extremely
unlikely.
what
is
a
little
more
likely
is
what
happened
here,
and
that's
where
a
person
is
in
state
custody,
either
serving
a
sentence
or
pending
disposition
of
another
case
is
borrowed
by
the
federal
government
under
a
writ.
there's
some
disposition,
and
then
is
returned
to
state
custody.
in
those
cases
there's
potential
either
way,
either
for
the
potential
loss
of
otherwise
entitled
credit,
or
for
what
the
government
refers
to
as
double
credit.
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
keep
those
really
from
being
a
concern
that
congress
would
have
had
felt
to
justify,
keeping
this
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
as
opposed
to
placing
in
the
district
court.
one
thing,
in
both
situations,
where
the
person
is
in
state
custody
where
there
are
parallel
prosecutions.
if
he's
arrested
by
the
state
first,
prosecuted
there,
not
yet
to
disposition,
also
prosecuted
in
federal
court...
which
we're
seeing
also
in
growing
numbers
in
drug
cases
and
sometimes
in
gun
cases...
what
happens
in
those
situations
most
of
the
time
is
that
the
state
parallel
prosecution
is
dismissed.
the
person
is
turned
over
for
federal
prosecution
and
usually
for
federal
custody
after...
usually
before
disposition
of
the
federal
case,
and
so
at
that
point,
the
state
case
either
has,
or
is
about
to
be
dismissed.
so
there's
not
going
to
be
a
question
of
credit
attributed
to
another
state
sentence
and
the
district
court
will
be
in
a
position,
then
to
measure
and
evaluate
any
prior
jail
credit
and
award
it
or
not
award
it.
there
also
are
going
to
be
cases
where
the
person
already
adjudicated
and
serving
a
state
sentence
is
borrowed
under
a
writ
by
the
federal
government
for
the
purpose
of
the
prosecution
of
the
federal
case.
in
those
cases,
under
the
statute
he's
not
entitled
to
that
credit
because
it's
already
been
attributed
to
the
state
sentence
that
he's
now
serving.
the
much
less
frequent
possibility
is...
is
actually
what
happened
here.
i
mean,
this
is
the
only
case
that
i
can
find
in
the
cases
since
3585
where
this
has
actually
occurred.
and
that
is
where
the
person
is
released
by
the
state
to
the
federal
government...
both
charges
still
pending...
is
adjudicated
first
in
federal
court,
sentenced,
then
is
sentenced
by
the
state
court
after
that.
so
at
the
point
when
federal
sentence
is
imposed,
state
sentence
has
not
been
imposed.
there's
no
credit
yet
for
the
time
in
custody.
but
at
some
point
in
time
after
that
there
is
adjudication
in
state
court
and
credit
is
either
awarded
or
denied.
so
there's
a
potential
under
that
scenario,
under
this
scenario,
for
a
double
credit,
which
congress
did
intend
to
avoid.
however,
there
are
adequate
protections
for
that
not
to
happen
unless
the
state
wants
it
to
happen,
which
the
state
has
a
right
for
it
to
happen,
that
congressional
intent
will
not
be
subverted
by
the
district
court
making
this
determination
for
all
the
reasons
that
we
think
the
district
court
should
be
making
the
determination
anyway.
the
state
court
at
the
time...
in
this
case,
at
the
time
mr.
wilson
came
into
the
state
court
for
adjudication
and
for
sentencing,
the
state
court
knew
what
the
federal
sentence
was.
these
were
parallel
and
related
prosecutions,
joint
investigations,
mutual
cooperation
between
the
law
enforcement
authorities.
the
state
court
knew
what
the
disposition
of
mr.
wilson's
sentence
was.
at
that
time
what
they
knew
was
that
the
district
court
had
denied
credit.
they
awarded
credit,
they
sentenced
him
to
a
sentence
that
would
run
concurrent
with
the
federal
sentence,
and
that
under
state
law
would
be
consumed
by
the
federal
sentence.
so
their
intent
as
reflected
in
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
on
him
in
state
court,
was
that
he
get
double
credit,
not
just
for
time
in
custody
prior
to
trial,
but
for
all
purposes.
in
other
words,
by
giving
him
a
concurrent
sentence--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--yes,
sir.
there
are
two
responses--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
frustration
of
federal
intent
if
it's
a
matter
that's
in
the
control
of
the
state
courts
and
is
left
within
the
control
of
the
state
courts
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
not
necessarily.
in
fact,
it's
probably
more
likely
it
will...
that
there
will
be
situations
where
it
will
not
be
achieved
under
the
bureau
of
prisons'
approach,
then
under
the
approach
with
the
district
court
makes
that
determination.
one
such
scenario
would
be
a
person
who
is
arrested
by
state
authorities
after
the
commission
of
a
federal
offense,
spend
some
period
of
time,
say
60
days
in
custody,
then
makes
bond
in
state
court,
is
released.
and
some
period
of
time
after
that
is
sentenced
in
federal
court,
receives
a
6-month
sentence,
goes
off
to
serve
that
sentence,
state
case
still
pending,
unadjudicated.
at
the
end
of
4
months,
he
then
says
to
the
prison,
look,
i've
already...
i've
done
60
days
of
custody
that's
not
been
credited
to
another
offense,
to
another
conviction.
i'm
entitled
to
be
released.
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
have
no
option
at
that
point
but
to
release
the
person.
the
next
day
they
may
be
adjudicated
in
state
court,
given
credit
for
that
60
days.
and
so
even
under
that
scenario...
neither--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
i
will
concede
that
there
can
be
scenarios
under
which
the
district
court
making
the
determination
could
result
in
the
award
of
double
credit.
i
think
that
those
situations
are
so
infrequent
to...
unlikely
to
occur,
so
few
in
number,
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
to
design
a
system
just
to
account
for
those.
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
design
a
system
that
was
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
that
would
efficiently
and
effectively
and
fairly
handle
the
vast
majority
of
cases
where
this
statute
would
apply.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
the
government
says
that--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
if
you
assume
that
congress
intended
for
this
decision
to
be
made
at
some
point
in
time,
at
some
precise
point
in
time,
either
imposition
of
sentence
or
commencement
of
sentence,
if
those
are
different
dates,
that
if
the
decision
is
made
at
a
precise
point
in
time,
there
are
going
to
be
people
who
for
arbitrary
reasons
fall
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
that
line.
and
as
a
result
only
of
that
arbitrariness
receive
or
don't
receive
credit.
for
instance,
if
the
line
is
to
be
drawn--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--there
are
two
possible...
and
these
are
not
articulated
in
the
government's
brief...
there
are
two
possible
alternatives
the
bureau
of
prisons
make
in
this
determination.
one
would
be
that
they
make
it
as
of
the
facts
existing
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
the
sentence
with
no
change
after
that.
the
other
scenario
would
be
the
bureau
of
prisons
making
the
decision
and
reevaluating
or
changing
the
decision
at
any
time
during
the
service
of
the
prison
sentence.
that
scenario
is
the
one
that
they
articulate
in
their
brief,
and
that's
the
only
scenario
that
i
think
would
avoid
any
possibility
of
an
aberration
of
what
congress
intended
under
3585,
because
otherwise
if
you
say
it
can't
happen
after
commencement
of
sentence,
then
the
person
who
is
sentenced
in
state
court
after
that
or
before
that,
you
have
this
disparity
only
because
of
that
date.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
should
make
this
determination
and
that
the
determination
is
subject
to
revision
throughout
the
course
of
the
person's
incarceration,
then
that's
a
result,
i
think,
that
just
goes
directly
in
the
face
of
everything
congress
was
saying
about
certainty
of
sentencing
and
certainty
of
release
date.
i
think
that
all
of
the
language
talking
about
parole,
about
good-time
credits,
where
congress
says
that
these
result
in
a
prisoner
not
knowing
until
the
date
that
he
or
she
is
released
what
that
release
date
is
going
to
be
is
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
sentencing
as
we
see
them.
that
it's
important
for
the
prisoner
and
for
everyone
to
know
at
the
date
of
sentencing
what
that
release
date's
going
to
be
subject
only
to
reduction
by
good
time.
so
that
the
only
absolute
way
to
insure
that
there's
no
aberrational
application
of
this
statute
is
one
that
would
allow
its
revision
up
through
the
very
release
of
the
prisoner
from
the
institution.
that,
however,
i
find
is
so
contrary
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
that
i
don't
think
congress
could
have
planned
to
do
that.
sentencing
credit,
jail
credit
for
an
individual
is
not
just
some
technical
manipulation
of
a
sentence,
as
the
government
would
have
this
court
believe.
in
this
case
and
in
most
cases
where
there
is
prior
credit,
it's
going
to
have
a
significant
impact
on
when
that
prisoner's
released
from
the
institution.
and
while
the
government
may
say
there's
a
distinction
between
determining
duration
of
sentence
and
determining
release
date,
the
number
one
thing
on
the
mind
of
the
individual
in
the
institution
is
when
do
i
get
out
of
here.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
no,
sir.
congress,
in
addition
to
deleting
the
attorney
general
from
this
process,
narrowed
substantially
the
discretion.
what
it
left
basically
was
there
are
about
two
or
three
factors
to
be
resolved,
and
based
on
what
those
factors
are,
you
either
get
the
credit
or
you
don't
get
the
credit.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
oh,
no,
sir.
no,
sir.
it
depends
on
the
facts
in
his
case
and
the
nature
of
his
confinement,
if
any,
prior
to
trial
and
the
nature,
if
any,
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
there
are
two
ways.
for
one
thing,
if
it's
on
appeal
and
it
comes
back
for
resentencing,
then
it
can
be
accounted
for
at
the
resentencing,
if
whatever
is
going
to
happen
has
happened
during
that
period.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
a
couple
of
different
ways.
if
it
turns
out
that
during
that
period
of
time
the
person
accrues
additional
time
of
official
detention,
which
is
what
the
statute
now
says,
that's
not
attributed
to
another
conviction,
that
can
be
remedied
under
2255.
and
i
think
at
that
point
it
would
be
2255
rather
than
2241
because
under
my
theory
this
determination
is
part
of
the
imposition
of
sentence.
and
so
we
come
back
to
the
district
of
sentencing
under
2255.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
i
think
that
in
that
case
that
the
concern
then
is
that
he
not
receive
double
credit.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
now
i
think
that
that
concern
is
going
to
be
resolved
basically
by
the
state
court.
and
that
there
will
not
be
double
credit
of
the
kind
that
congress
sought
to
avoid--
mr.
henry
a.
martin
--no,
sir,
not
effectively.
and
i
think
the
circumstances
where
the
state
can't
prevent
double
crediting
are
going
to
be
so
unique
and
so
remote...
and
i'm
not
even
sure
that
it
would
occur.
i
can't
say
that
they
absolutely
wouldn't.
in
this
case
in
particular,
if
the
state
had
not
wanted
mr.
wilson
to
have
double
credit,
they
could
have
either
made
it
run
consecutive,
they
could
have
increased
the
amount
of
time
that
he
was
going
to
receive
in
his
state
time,
they
could
have
not
released
him
on
parole,
they
could
have
made
up
that
429
days,
even
though
the
federal
court
had
given
him
credit
for
that.
i
think
in
the...
in
the
end
analysis
for
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
will
come
before
a
court,
the
resolution
of
this
issue
by
the
factfinding
and
legal
determination
process
of
the
court
at
the
sentencing
hearing
is
a
much
more
workable
process.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
it
could
result
in
an
inconsistent
outcome.
if
that
were
to
result
in
that
happening
in
a
number
of
cases,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
handling
that
question
like
they
handle
it
now,
where
it
takes
months
and
months
and
winds
up
having
to
come
back
to
court
anyway,
i
don't
think
congress
would
have
intended
that.
i
think
congress
would
have
preferred
the
decision
is
made
now
based
on
the
facts
known
to
the
court.
that
kind
of
shared
jurisdiction,
i
think
congress
probably
actually
didn't
have
in
mind.
just
actually
counting
up
days,
you
know,
once
the
court
determines
what
the
timing
is,
i
think
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
do
that
and
congress
had
anticipated
that
they
would.
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make.
of
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
3585
since
its
enactment,
the
vast
majority
of
the
issues
involved
in
those
were
questions
that
were
based
on
facts
known
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
were
justiciable
questions
that
the
court
could
and
should
have
resolved.
the
questions
of
the
nature
of
the
detention,
whether
or
not
that
equates
with
official
detention
and
custody,
questions
of
entitlement.
and
questions
that
could
and
should
be
resolved
by
the
district
court
at
that
time.
and
if
done
so,
would
be
much
more
consistent
with
purposes
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
mr.
henry
a.
martin
as
a
numerical
matter,
yes,
most
sentencing
credit
issues
are
routine
issues
involving
presentencing
credit.
but
the
number
of
instances
in
which
there
is
postsentencing
detention
for
which
an
individual
could
get
credit,
those
instances
are
considerable.
sometimes
individuals
are
held
on
the
state
side,
the
charges
are
dropped,
the
individual's
given
probation,
so
his
state
presentence
time
doesn't
count
towards
anything.
his
state
conviction
is
overturned.
all
of
these
scenarios
can
happen.
