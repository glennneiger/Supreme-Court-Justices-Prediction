when
did
this
particular
language
appear
in
the
sentencing

act?

the
absence
of
it.
was
it
on
the
initial
draft
when
it
was
first
proposed?
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
if
the...
i
would
think
the
attorney
general
would
have
raised
a
big
stink
about
this
somewhere
in
the
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think,
ms.
wax,
that
if
at
the
time
the
attorney
general
had
noticed
this
thing,
he
would
have
objected
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
that
isn't
what
i
said.
if
at
the
time,
he
had
noticed
it,
he
would
have
objected
to
it,
i
assume.
did
he?
did
he
ever
write
a
letter
about
this
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
like
to
know
because
if
he
wrote
a
letter
and
called
this
to
congress'
attention
and
objected
to
his
being
cut
out,
and
congress
nevertheless
left
it
this
way,
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
the
decision.
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
didn't
notice
the
language.
justice
byron
r.
white
who...
as
originally
introduced,
was
the
bill...
did
the
bill
contain
this
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
that
if
you
are
right
that
the
sentence...
you
say
sentence
begins
when
the
judge--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
general
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
statutory
provision
that
says
the
sentence
begins
when
the
judge's
gavel
comes
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
is
it
the
sentence
begins
the
moment
that
he
is
sentenced?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
it
never...
why
would
it
ever
be
the
case
that
it
would
begin
only
when
he
arrives
at
the
penitentiary?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
he's
out,
if
he's
out,
why
he...
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
judge
would
know
how
much
time,
if
any,
he
had
ever
spent
before
he
sentenced.
