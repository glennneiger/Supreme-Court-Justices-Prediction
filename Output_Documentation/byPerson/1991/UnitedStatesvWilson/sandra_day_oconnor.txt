justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
your...
do
you
rely
chiefly
for
the
practical
difficulties
on
the
fact
that
it's
not
easy
for
the
district
court
to
know
what
is
going
to
happen
after
the
sentence
is
handed
down
and
before
the
incarceration
actually
begins?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
district
court
does
have
adequate
knowledge
of
everything
that
happens
up
to
the
day
of
sentencing,
i
suppose,
by
virtue
of
the
presentence
report,
and
one
thing
and
another.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you're
correct,
and
the
bureau
of
the
prisons
would
still
be
calculating
the
credits,
what's
the
mechanism
for
judicial
review
of
that
action
in
the
event
that
a
defendant
says
the
bureau
of
prisons
did
it
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
martin,
the
problem
doesn't
lie
with
all
that.
the
problem
lies
with
what
happens
after
the
sentence
is
handed
down.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
talk
about
that?
