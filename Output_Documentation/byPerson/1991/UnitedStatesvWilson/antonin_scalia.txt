justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
he
didn't
write
one,
i
suppose
we
should
assume
that...
i
mean
if
we
have
no
evidence
that
he
wrote
one,
then
i
guess
we
should
assume
that
he
didn't
object?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can't
have
it
one
way...
you
can't
use
it
if
it's
there
and
not
use
it
if
it's
not
there.
i
mean,
if
this
is
relevant
stuff,
we
should
be
guided
by
it.
seeing
no
letter
from
the
attorney
general,
we
assume
that
he
had
no
objection
to
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
we'll
have
to
read
the
law.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
martin,
i
mean,
it's
interesting
how
that
might
work
and
whatnot,
but
can
we
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute
since
we
don't
have
any
legislative
history.
it
seems
to
me
the
government
uses
the
word
was,
and
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
was
would
apply
even
if
the
judge
is
doing
the
job.
it
isn't
the
word
was
that
impresses
me,
it's
the
fact
that
it
reads,
that
the
defendant
shall
be
given
credit
for
any
time
he
has
spent
in
official
detention
prior
to
the
date
the
sentence
commences.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
any
time
he
has
spent.
that
indicates
to
me
that
the
credit
is
going
to
be
given
at
the
time
the
sentence
commences.
i
don't
see
how
a
judge
right
now
can
give
you
credit
for
all
the
time
you
have
spent
prior
to
the
time
the
sentence
commences.
it's
only
the
attorney
general
who
could
possibly
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
say
for
any
time
he
will
have
spent?
if
they
envisioned
that
most
of
this,
90
percent
of
it,
would
be
done
by
the
trial
judge,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
read,
shall
be
given
credit
for
any
time
he
shall
have
spent
in
official
detention
prior
to
the
date
the
sentence
commences.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
any
time
he
has
spent.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
obviously,
but
they
use
the
date
the
sentence
commences
because
that
will
sometimes
differ
from
the
date
of
judgment.
otherwise
they
could
just
say,
you
know,
from
the
time
of
the
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
to
focus
on
that
area
where
there
is
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
where
there
is
a
difference,
if
they
had
meant
the
judge
to
impose
the
sentence,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
have
said,
for
any
time
you
shall
have
spent.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
their
intent
frustrate
the
federal
intent?
the
federal
intent
only
intends
to
credit
something
that
has
not
been
credited
against
another
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
the
states
have
the
power
to
frustrate
the
federal
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
only
left
within
the
control
of
the
state
courts
if
you
interpret
the
statute
the
way
you
want
to
interpret
it.
don't
you
think
it's
more
reasonable
to
interpret
the
statute
in
such
a
fashion
that
you
will
be
able
to
achieve
what
the
statute
says,
and
that
is
not
to
allow
a
credit
that
has
been
credited
against
another
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
can
be
achieved
by
letting
the
attorney
general
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
result
that
flows
from
the
text
of
the
federal
statute.
it
says
that
has
not
been
credited.
i
mean,
if
he's
finished
his
federal
sentence
before
the
crediting
by
the
state
occurs,
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
way
you
want
to
do
it,
there
will
be...
even
though
before
his
federal
sentence
is
completed
it
is
credited
in
the
state,
the
crediting
will
count.
and
that's
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
when
you
say
it
happens
because
of
our
federal
system
that...
i
mean
my
point
is
it
doesn't
have
to
happen.
you
can
give
force
to
what
the
congress--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
unnatural
way
to
put
it
if
this
kind
of
a
situation
is
common.
