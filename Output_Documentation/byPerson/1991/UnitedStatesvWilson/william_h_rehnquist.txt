chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-1745,
united
states
v.
richard
wilson.
you
may
proceed,
ms.
wax.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did
change...
delete
the
language,
saying
that
the
attorney
general
would
determine
the
credit,
though,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
most
logical
reading
of
a
change
in
the
statute
like
that,
where
it
used
to
say
the
attorney
general
will
determine
it
and
now
it
doesn't
say
that
is
that
congress
no
longer
meant
for
the
attorney
general
to
determine
it.
that's
not
to
say
it's
the
only
reading,
but
certainly,
that's
the
first
inference
one
would
draw.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
rule
35?
would
that
be
available?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
sentence,
to
you,
refers
to
a
gross
amount,
not
the
net
amount,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
martin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
suggest,
do
you,
mr.
martin,
that
there's
discretion
confided
to
whoever
determines
sentencing
credit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
while
it's
obviously
important
to
the
defendant,
it
does
not
depend
on
any
peculiar
merit
of
his.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
ms.
wax,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
you
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1745,
united
states
against
wilson
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
