mr.
scott
m.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
is
reluctant
to
change
the
constitutional
limitations
on
the
conduct
of
the
federal
government,
with
good
reason.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
what
i
meant
to
say
by
that,
your
honor,
or
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
law
of
double
jeopardy
has
changed
slowly,
and
in
recognition
to
some--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--it
did.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
grady
v.
corbin
represents
a
direct...
is
a
direct
descendent
of
the
issues
raised
in
brown
v.
ohio,
in
harris
v.
oklahoma,
in
illinois
v.
vitale...
and
we're
talking
about
cases
that
occurred
15
years
ago
today,
in
1977,
brown
v.
ohio
and
some
of
the
others.
i
would
say
that's
a
relatively
slow
change.
those
cases
i
believe
recognize
that
in
the
context
of
the
double
jeopardy
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
successive
trials,
that
a
mere
statutory
interpretation
such
as
blockburger
is
insufficient
and
there
must
be
some
conduct
or
some
fact
base
analysis
to
go
along
in
order
to
fully
implement
that
protection.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i
would,
your
honor,
except
that
not...
that
is
not
so
in
the
case
of
successive
prosecutions.
i
think
i
have
fully
briefed
that,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
1868
thomas
cooley,
mr.
justice
cooley
from
the
michigan
supreme
court,
wrote
a
landmark
book
that
was
published
in
1868
called
constitutional
limitations.
his
interpretation
of
that
time,
in
which
he
analyzed
all
of
the
law
back
to
the
beginning
from
the
time
of
1791
when
the
bill
of
rights
was
enacted,
consisted
of
this,
and
i
quote
from
the
first
edition,
page
328:
where
the
legal
bar
has
once
attached...
that
is,
the
jeopardy
bar...
the
government
cannot
avoid
it
by
varying
the
form
of
the
charge
in
a
new
accusation.
if
the
first
indictment
or
information
were
such
that
the
accused
might
have
been
convicted
under
it
on
proof
of
the
facts
by
which
the
second
is
sought
to
be
sustained,
then
the
jeopardy
which
attached
on
the
first
must
constitute
a
protection
against
the
trial
on
the
second.
in
other
words--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor's
opinion
that
the
cases
in
this
court
authorize
in
the
case
of
a
single
trial
the
conviction
for
both
an
attempt
and
a
conspiracy.
there's
no
problem
with
that.
i
submit
that
that
is
in
fact
the
law.
where
we
disagree
is
what
the
law
says
in
the
context
of
successive
prosecutions,
and
i
believe
grady
v.
corbin
speaks
to
that
better
than
any
case
in
the
history
of
this
court.
the
court
has
expanded
constitutional
guarantees
against
successive
prosecution
by
introducing
a
conduct-based
element
of
analysis
into
the
double
jeopardy
on
successive
prosecutions.
let's
see
what
really
happened
in
this
record
in
the
felix
case
and
what
the
government
did
and
why
they
did
it.
the
record
in
the
missouri
trial,
of
which
this
case
is
not
an
appeal,
is
on
file
and
is
of
record
in
this
case,
now.
from
the
beginning
of
the
prosecution
in
missouri
the
united
states
attorney
in
his
opening
statement
relies
heavily
on
all
of
the
conducts
of
the
beggs
lab
in
oklahoma,
and
this
is
at
page
14...
13
through
19
of
the
record
in
the
missouri
case.
the
first
statement
out
of
the
box
by
the
united
states
attorney
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
is,
and
i
quote:
the
story
in
this
case
goes
back
to
may...
i
think
may,
early
june
of
1987.
you
will
learn
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
met
up
with
a
gentleman
named
mr.
roach.
from
there
he
goes
on
to
describe
the
proof
that
will
be
offered
by
the
government
in
the
missouri
trial,
which
consists
of
all
of
the
conduct
of
all
of
the
co-conspirators
which
was
later
tried
in
the
oklahoma
trial.
we
would
not
be
before
this
court,
in
my
opinion,
if
the
oklahoma
trial
had
occurred
first.
there
would
be
no
question
that,
having
alleged
in
the
overt
elements...
the
overt
acts
in
the
count
1
of
the
conspiracy,
that
those
acts
were
relied
on
and
tried
in
oklahoma
and
would
be
a
bar
to
the
trial
in
missouri.
it
is
an
extension
of
the
direct
language
of
brown
v.
ohio
that
what
difference
does
it
make
if
you
try
the
lesser
first
or
if
you
try
the
greater.
what
significance
does
it
have
for
double
jeopardy
law
that
this
case
was
tried,
prosecuted
promptly,
as
the
solicitor
has
argued
in
this
case?
i
want
to
give
you
some
dates
that
i
consider
to
be
significant
in
the
history
of
this
case.
the
first
date
is
august
31st,
which
is
alleged
in
both
of
the
indictments,
both
the
missouri
and
the
oklahoma
indictment.
the
next
date
is
september
15th,
1987.
that
is
the
date
of
the
indictment
in
the
missouri
case.
the
missouri
trial
occurred
beginning
november
30th,
1987.
an
appeal
was
filed
with
the
eighth
circuit.
the
next
significant
date
is
february
3rd,
1989.
on
that
date,
the
eighth
circuit
returned
its
opinion
affirming
mr.
felix's
conviction
in
the
eastern
district...
or
western
district
of
missouri.
the
next
significant
date
is
february
16th,
1989,
because
that
is
the
date
of
the
oklahoma
indictment.
that
is
3
weeks...
or
2...
less
than
3
weeks
after
the
court
of
appeals
in
st.
louis
had
placed
its
stamp
of
approval
on
the
conviction
of
mr.
felix.
the
evidence
used
to
prove
the
conduct
in
the
two
trials
varied
very
little.
through
the
evidence,
through
the
testimony
of
four
witnesses
in
both
trials
against
mr.
felix...
paul
dean
roach;
carolyn
ruybals,
the
chemist;
george
dwinnells,
the
cooperating
individual;
and
john
coonce,
the
head
of
the
dea
in
tulsa...
in
the
oklahoma
trial
every
element
of
every
allegation
brought
against
mr.
felix
was
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
jury
in
the
missouri
trial.
if
you
read
the
testimony
of
those
four
who
testified
in
both
trials,
there
can
be
no
doubt--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--that's
correct.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
no,
ma'am.
that
is
what
the
government
would
have
you
believe.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
that
is
the
government's
and
the
solicitor
general's
argument
in
this
case.
it
turns
out
that
on
february
16th,
1989,
instead
of
being
merely
a
cooperating
witness,
george...
excuse
me...
paul
dean
roach
becomes
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
in
the
conspiracy
of
the
case.
in
the
missouri
case
he
was
presented
as
someone
who
was
going
to
give
you
mirror
evidence--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--the
conduct...
the
complete
conduct
which
is
alleged
in
the
indictment
of
february
16th,
1989
and
the
oklahoma
trial,
trial
number
2,
was
proven
through
the
witnesses
that
i
pointed
out
and
trial
number
1,
the
oklahoma
trial.
i
believe
it's
a
red
herring
to
say
that
the
substantive
counts
are
different
in
some
way
from
the
conspiracy
count.
if
we
had
tried...
if
it
had
been
tried
all
together...
and
it
was
in
fact
tried
all
together
in
oklahoma.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
no,
it
doesn't--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--but
this
is
not
merely
similar
act
evidence.
this
is
proof
by
evidence
of
conduct,
which
grady
forbids
to
be
used
in
two
trials
to
prove
a
material
element.
reliance
on
the
term
evidence
is
too
elusive
for
this
court
to
grasp,
i
think,
as
any
kind
of
standard,
because
evidence
in
my
experience
can...
or
facts
or
the
conduct
can
be
proved
by
different
forms
of
evidence.
it's
too
slippery
a
doctrine.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
if
such
an
opinion
is
adopted
by
this
court
it
would
constitute
the
authority
for
the
united
states
government
to
decide
to
try
the
small
offenses
first.
what
does
this
do?
what
does
this
deprive
the
defendant
of?
in
the
first
trial,
this
was
alleged
to
be
404(b)
evidence.
okay?
in
the
second
trial,
this
was
undoubtedly
801(d)(2)(e)
evidence
from
roach,
from
paul
dean
roach,
the
unindicted
co-conspirator.
certain
protections
attach
to
that
evidence
when
it
is
an
acknowledged,
as
a
matter
of
law,
co-conspirator,
and
that
is
an
inquiry
into
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
and
a
finding
by
the
court
before
the
evidence
is
allowed
that
the
conspiracy
in
fact
exists,
a
prima
facie
showing
by
the
government.
no
such
requirement
exists
on
404(b)
evidence
now.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i
am
trying
to
respond,
if
i
may
continue.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
what
they
have
to
do
with
is
what
effect
it
has
to
try
this
man
twice.
the
government
gets
to
rehearse
the
practice
and
practice
their
proof.
they
get
to
see
what
defenses
will
be
raised
and
structure
their
proof
to
meet
those
defenses.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--but
the
government
chose--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--my
answer
is,
the
government
chose
to
prosecute
him
for
the
conduct
twice.
they
may
not
choose
to
do
that
in
the
future
because
of
grady
v.
corbin,
but
they
did
here
in
this
trial.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
what's
the
matter
with
it
is
that
if--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--well,
you
have...
you're
being
deprived
of
your
right
to
have
determined
in
one...
at
one
trial
all
the
facts
and
all
of
the
statutory
violations
that
you
may
have--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--it
comes
from
the
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
well,
i
believe
that
brown
v.
ohio
is
a
case...
is
for
it,
all
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
if...
that
would
be
the
standard
if...
let
me
back
up
just
a
moment.
the
events
that
occurred
in
this
case
over
the
period
of
time
from
june
until
august
were
all
one...
part
of
one
conspiracy,
and
that
was
understood
by
the
government
and
that
is
the
way
they
charged
it.
i
don't
want
to
hypothesize
any
further
on
what
they
could
have
done,
because
i'm
only
dealing
with
what
they
did
to
mr.
felix
here.
they
chose
to
prosecute
him
under
the
overt
acts
which
the
court...
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
in
this
case,
which
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
they
must
consider
in
a
finding
of
guilt
on
the
conspiracy
charge.
in
regards
to
the
evidence
and--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--it
is.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
which
was
attempt
to
manufacture
methamphetamines,
and
in
order
to
prove
the
material
element--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--well,
attempt
has
two
parts
that
need
to
be
proved.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
one
is
intent.
the
specific
conduct
which
was
used
to
prove
the
intent
was
the
entire
beggs
lab
and
oklahoma
conspiracy.
that's
the
evidence
of
knowledge--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--there
is...
substantial
step.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
it's
a
substantial
step
toward
the
accomplishment
of
the
manufacturing.
i
believe
that
the
court
in
the
eighth
circuit
stated
that
this
evidence
was
also
used
to
prove
the
substantial
step,
but
i
do
agree
with
the
solicitor
on
this
point,
and
that
is
that
the
acquisition
of
the
chemicals
in
august
26th
and
the
receipt
of
them
in
august
31st
should
be
considered
the
conduct
which
constitutes
the
substantial
step
portion
of
the
attempt
conviction.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
other
than
the
beggs
laboratory
and
the
evidence
of
the
conspiracy,
no.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
it
is
some
evidence,
but
they
also
included
all
those
dates
within
the
prosecution
for
the
conspiracy
in
the
oklahoma
case
and
used
it
as--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--i
will
not
make
that
argument.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
if
you
perceive
that
to
be
my
argument--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--that's
correct.
i
believe
that
you're...
the
line
of
reasoning
that
you're
referring
to
is
judge
newman's
dissent
in
the...
calderone
case.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
adopt
that.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
that
could
not
possibly
constitute
the
entire
proof
or
even
proof
of
his
intent.
that--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--that
conduct
in
oklahoma--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--that
conduct
in
oklahoma
was
used
to
prove
the
intent
in
the
missouri--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--my
point
to
the
court
which
i
tried
to
make
at
the
beginning
was
that
if
you
have
different
results
when
you
try
them
in
reverse
order
then
it
is
not
a
standard
which
can
be
applied
in
implementing
the
protections
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
if
this
were
tried
in
reverse,
i
don't
believe
that
we'd
be
standing
before
this
court.
everything
tried
in
oklahoma
was
tried
in
missouri,
and
having
been
alleged
as
an
overt
act
and
ordered
by
the
judge
in
his
charge
that
the
jury
must...
that
they
must
prove
those
overt
acts,
i
don't
believe
that
we'd
be
standing
here
before
you.
there'd
be
no
question
that
a
missouri
prosecution
following
the
oklahoma
prosecution
was
double
jeopardy.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i
believe
the
charge
of
the
court
in
that
matter
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
and
i
can't
find
the
citation
at
this
time,
but
i
think
the
exact
charge
from
the
missouri
court
is
cited,
and
it's
in
the
opinion
of
felix
from
the
missouri
case
and
addressed
by
the
eighth
circuit,
which
said
it
was
virtually
the
only
evidence
in
that
case
of
intent,
and
that
no
other
evidence
existed
for
intent.
now,
the
government
argued
that
at
the
eighth
circuit,
and
now
the
government
wants
to
argue
something
different
before
this
court
in
a
different
case.
i
can't
blame
them.
to
show
you
how
much
they
relied
on
it,
in
the
missouri
trial
in
the
final
arguments,
page
465,
at
line
16,
the
government's
final
argument
is:
we
have
to
show
you
that
what
he
did
he
did
knowingly
and
intentionally.
we
showed
that
through
the
beggs
oklahoma
lab,
and
by
his
conduct
in
joplin,
by
his
statements
to
george...
that's
george
dwinnells,
the
confidential
informant...
and
by
george's
evidence
dovetailing
with
roach's,
the
later
unindicted
co-conspirator,
and
by
lamar
evans
out
of
rowlett,
texas.
they
relied
heavily
on
that.
they
relied
on
that
as
their
only
proof
of
intent.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
i
believe
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
st.
louis
in
the
first
case--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--that's
why
i'm
here.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
it
has--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--i
don't
believe
that
grady
says
it
has
to
constitute
the
entire
proof,
the
only
proof
that--
mr.
scott

--yes,
sir,
that
is
my
answer.
all
of
the
exhibits
introduced
in
the
missouri
trial
included
exhibits
4
through
11
and
17,
which
were
photographs
of
beggs
lab;
18
through
23
were
the
drugs
from
the
beggs
lab,
and
number
46
through
48
exhibits
introduced
in
the
missouri
trial
were...
to
refute
an
alibi
defense
of
defendant
felix
to
being
at
the
lab
on
november
13th.
there
were
only
44
exhibits
introduced
at
the
trial
in
missouri
and
by
and
large
the
majority
of
them
were
from
the
beggs
lab
operation.
they
were
introduced
again
with
duplicate
plaintiff's
evidence
stickers
placed
on
them
in
the
missouri...
in
the
oklahoma
trial,
as
noted
in
the
majority
opinion
from
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
they
were
2
of
17...
or
18,
excuse
me.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
the--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--mr.
felix
was
convicted...
or,
excuse
me...
was
charged
in
9
of
the
18
overt
acts.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
each
one
of
those
overt
acts,
as
each
one
of
the
substantive
crimes
which
they
were
accused
of
violating
under
846,
were
all
included
in
the
proof
that
was
given
at
the
missouri
trial.
what
you
have
here
in
this
record
from
the
missouri
trial...
pardon
me...
is
a
textbook--
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
were
offered
in
proof
through
the
four
witnesses
that
i
mentioned
at
the
missouri
trial...
every
one
of
them.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
the
government
would
argue
that
nothing
has
to
be
proven
in
a
conspiracy,
and
they're
pretty
nearly
right.
no
overt
acts
has
to...
have
to
be
alleged
or
proven
in
an
846
conspiracy,
but
when
they
are
alleged
they
have
to
be
proven.
they
were
alleged
here.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
they
could
convict
on
the
other
overt
acts.
that
is
correct.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
and
they
could
still
convict,
but
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
it's
not
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
the
instructions
are
set
forth
in
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
it
did,
and
i'll
give
you
the
cite
to
the
amicus
brief.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
page
33.
mr.
scott
m.
anderson
yes,
sir,
i
believe
they
were.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
i'll
just
make
a
closing
statement
that
no
one
needs
to
advise
this
court,
on
the
200th
anniversary
of
the
bill
of
rights,
how
important
it
is
that
this
court
stands
firm,
as
it
had...
has
for
over
200
years,
and
served
its
purpose
as
the
third
branch
of
government,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
prosecution
for
us.
thank
you
very
much.
