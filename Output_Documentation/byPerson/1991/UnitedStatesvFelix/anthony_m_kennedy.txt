under
a
strict
application
of
grady
would
the
case
have
been...
would
the
prosecution
have
been
invalid
if
in
the
indictment,
in
the
charging
papers
for
the
missouri
attempt,
they
had
alleged
the
beggs
operation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
in
the
attempted
prosecution
they
had
treated
the
beggs
operation
as
the
exclusive
evidence
of
the
intent...
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
work
with
the
hypothetical
for
a
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
have
made
a
difference?
because
intent
is
an
element
of
the
attempt
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you're
proving
intent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
way
grady
reads,
as
i
understand
it,
it
takes
elements
of
the
crime
in
a
not
a
very
academic
or
formalistic
way,
and
intent
is
really
more
of
an
element
than...
i
really
think
than
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
grady.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
adopted
the
rationale
as
you
propose
it
here
i
take
it
that
would
not
disturb
the
holding
of
calderone.
