i'm
not
sure
this
is
working.
going
back
to
grady,
the
proof
of
the
dwi
was
sufficient
to
prove
an
element
in
the
later
prosecution
in
grady.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
reason
it
was
sufficient
was
that
the
commission
of
dwi
constituted
negligent
behavior
and
therefore
that
satisfied
the
negligent
element
of
the
homicide.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
only
basis
on
which
we
could
say
that
it
was
being
used
to
prove
an
element
as
opposed
to...
or
constituting
element
and
as
opposed
to
merely
being
another
evidentiary
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
aren't
you
saying,
then,
that
if
the
state
selects
one
evidentiary
fact
as
the
means
to
prove
an
element,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
making
that
fact
the
element
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy?
