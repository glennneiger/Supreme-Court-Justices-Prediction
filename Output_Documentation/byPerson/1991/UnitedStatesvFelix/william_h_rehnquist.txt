chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
90-1599,
united
states
v.
frank
dennis
felix.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson--
--here
we
have
an
attempt
and
a
substantive
offense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
two
crimes
involved
in
grady
against
corbin
were
not
of
that
nature,
were
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
grady
against
corbin's
holding
does
not
apply
to
this
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that's
dicta,
then,
if
it's
not
the
holding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
do
you
think
a
court
can
convert
dicta
into
a
holding
by
simply
saying
in
front
of
the
dicta,
we
hold?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
anderson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
changed
rather
dramatically
in
grady
against
corbin,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
that's
an
example
of
the
court
being
reluctant
to
change
the
constitutional
law
relating
to
the
protection
of
defendants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
when
he
says
that
for
a
hundred
years,
being
considerably
longer
than
15
years,
the...
we
have
distinguished
between
substantive
offenses
and
conspiracies...
we
regard
them
as
separate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
feel
that
responds
to
the
question
about
what
the
cases
of
this
court
held
for
a
hundred
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
well,
why...
i
mean,
i
would
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
do
rules
of
evidence
have
to
do
with
the
double
jeopardy
inquiry?
i
mean,
you...
in
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question
you
cite
two
rules
of
evidence
under
federal
rules.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
bear
on
the
double
jeopardy
inquiry?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
to
try
him
twice,
but
by
justice
o'connor's
hypothesis
it's
not
for
the
same
offense,
it's
for
one
offense
that
occurred
in
july
and
another
offense
that
occurred
in
august.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
matter
with
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
objection
to
it
under
the
constitution?
i
realize
there
are
tactical
objections
on
the
part
of
his
defense
lawyer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
does
that
right
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
is
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
say
that
you're
entitled
to
have
determined
in
one
trial
everything
that
the
government
might
charge
you
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
same
transaction
test
which
the
court
has
never
adopted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
mr.
bryson,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
of
the
cases
is
united
states
versus
felix,
no.
90-1599.
during
the
summer
of
1987,
respondent,
frank
felix,
manufactured
methamphetamine
in
a
place
in
beggs,
oklahoma.
in
july
of
that
year,
drug
enforcement
agents
raided
the
facilities
and
shut
it
down
but
they
did
not
catch
felix.
desiring
to
continue
his
drug
manufacturing
business
felix,
thereupon,
ordered
additional
chemicals
and
equipment
from
a
dea
informant
and
arranged
for
their
delivery
to
a
joplin,
missouri
hotel
late
in
august.
federal
officials
watched
the
delivery,
arrested
felix,
and
charged
him
with
attempting
to
manufacture
methamphetamine.
at
his
trial
in
a
missouri
federal
court
for
that
crime,
felix
argued
that
he
had
ordered
the
items
only
because
he
mistakenly
believed
he
was
working
in
a
covert
dea
operation.
to
counter
this
argument
and
prove
felix's
criminal
intent,
the
government
introduced
evidence
concerning
felix's
involvement
in
the
production
of
methamphetamine
earlier
in
the
year
in
oklahoma.
the
jury
convicted
felix
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
that
conviction.
later,
the
government
indicted
felix
in
oklahoma
charging
him
with
conspiracy
to
manufacture
and
distribute
methamphetamine
as
well
as
with
five
other
substantive
and
drug
offenses.
these
charges
were
based
for
the
most
part
on
felix's
involvement
in
the
beggs,
oklahoma
methamphetamine
lab
in
early
1987.
however,
two
of
the
acts
supported
in
the
conspiracy
charge
were
based
on
the
same
conduct
for
which
felix
have
been
previously
prosecuted
in
the
missouri
trial,
and
the
evidence
introduced
against
felix
at
the
oklahoma
trial
was
very
similar
to
that
used
in
the
missouri
trial.
the
jury
convicted
felix
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
in
part.
it
held
that
the
subsequent
prosecution
of
felix
was
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
constitution
which
forbids
the
duplicative
prosecution
of
a
defendant
for
the
same
offense.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
felix's
prosecution
on
either
the
substantive
drug
offenses
or
the
conspiracy
charge.
the
substantive
offenses
with
which
felix
was
charged
in
oklahoma
differed
entirely
in
time
and
place
from
the
offense
for
which
he
was
prosecuted
in
missouri,
and
a
mere
overlap
in
proof
between
two
prosecutions
does
not
establish
a
double
jeopardy
violation.
and
in
light
of
our
longstanding
rule,
the
substantive
crime
in
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
crime
are
not
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
it
is
also
clear
that
the
government
did
not
violate
felix's
double
jeopardy
rights
by
prosecuting
him
in
oklahoma
on
the
conspiracy
charge.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
