justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
think
that's
a
pretty
easy
argument
in
regard
to
the
substantive
offenses,
and
the
more
difficult
one
relates
to
the
conspiracy
charge,
of
course,
as
affected
by
the
proof
in
the
attempt
trial
in
missouri.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
anderson,
in
the
missouri
indictment
i
guess
the
defendant
was
charged
with
attempting
to
manufacture
the
drug
during
some
dates
in
august--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
prosecutor
used
similar
acts
evidence
to
help
prove
intent
based
on
what
occurred
earlier
in
missouri
at
a
different
period
in
time.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
had
two
separate
inquiries
here.
one
relates
to
the
substantive
offenses,
the
attempt
offense
that
was
charged
in
missouri,
and
then
a
second
question
as
to
the
conspiracy
charge
in
missouri.
isn't
that
right?
don't
we
have
two
questions
to
address
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how...
i
mean,
grady
doesn't
even
purport
to
say
that
you
can't
use
the
same
evidence
if
you're
charging
an
offense
in...
that
occurred
in
august
in
missouri
and
you
use
evidence,
same...
similar
act
evidence
from
a
july
offense
in
oklahoma.
grady
doesn't
say
that's
prohibited,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you've
charged
a
second
attempt
that
occurred
in
august
in
missouri,
how
can
you
ever
say
double
jeopardy
prevents
proof
of
something
that...
evidence
of
something
that
had
occurred
at
an
earlier
date
in
a
different
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
to
my
satisfaction--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you've
certainly
responded.
