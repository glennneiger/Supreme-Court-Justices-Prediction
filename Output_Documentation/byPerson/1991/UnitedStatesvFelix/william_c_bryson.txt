mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
fairly
simple
and
not
that
unusual.
i'll
review
them
briefly.
the
case
involves
a
methamphetamine
manufacturing
operation
that
extended
over
a
4-month
period
over
the
summer
of
1987.
the
operation
had
essentially
two
stages.
the
first
stage
was
the
portion
of
the
operation
in
which
the
respondent
and
his
co-conspirators
sought
to
and
ultimately
succeeded
in
building
a
laboratory
to
manufacture
methamphetamine
in
beggs,
oklahoma,
a
small
town
south
of
tulsa.
they
manufactured
a
large
amount
of
methamphetamine
at
that
lab,
using
chemicals
which
they
had
procured
from
a
chemist
in
tulsa.
unfortunately
for
them,
the
chemist
in
tulsa
was
working
as
an
informant
for
the
dea,
and
his
tipping
off
the
dea
resulted
in
a
raid
on
the
lab
and
the
arrest
of
several
of
the
co-conspirators
and
nearly
resulted
in
the
arrest
of
respondent
felix.
that
raid
occurred
july
13,
1987,
and
it
terminated
that
enterprise
for
manufacturing
methamphetamine
at
that
time.
now,
undeterred
by
this
turn
of
events,
respondent
went
back
to
the
same
chemist,
not
realizing
that
he
was
working
with
the
dea
and
attempted
to
procure
some
more
chemicals
to
start
a
new
lab,
and
in
fact
ordered
in
late
august
of
1987
a
whole
set
of
the
chemicals
that
would
be
necessary
and
asked
that
they
be
delivered
in
missouri.
they
were,
and
at
the
time
of
the
delivery,
the
chemist
having
once
again
tipped
off
the
dea,
mr.
felix
was
arrested
in
missouri.
now,
he
was
prosecuted
very
quickly
in
missouri
for
the
crime
of
attempt
to
manufacture
methamphetamine.
in
the
course
of
that
trial,
the
missouri
trial,
the
prosecution
introduced
evidence
of
the
prior
operation
in
beggs,
oklahoma,
in
which
respondent
had
in
fact
manufactured
methamphetamine
and
had
set
up
the
lab
along
with
his
co-conspirators
and
introduced
that
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
the
defendant
had
the
intent
to
in
fact
manufacture
methamphetamine
with
these
chemicals
that
he
had
assembled
and
ordered
and
in
fact
had
the
capacity
to
do
so.
but
what's
important
for
our
purposes
is
it
was
that
evidence
of
the
beggs,
oklahoma,
operation
was
introduced
only
for
purposes
of
showing
his
intent.
it
wasn't
introduced
as
part
of
a
separate
prosecution
for
the
beggs
conduct.
in
other
words,
he
was
being
prosecuted
in
the
missouri
case
for
and
only
for
his
activities
in
late
august
of
1987,
the
activities
that
involved
the
attempt
to
manufacture
methamphetamine.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
this
was
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence
that
was
introduced
to
prove
the
intent.
that
exactly
right.
now,
subsequently
he
was
prosecuted...
the
respondent
was
prosecuted
with
several
of
his
co-conspirators
in
oklahoma
for
activities
surrounding
the
beggs,
oklahoma,
operation.
first,
he
was
prosecuted...
and
this
was
one
prosecution
which
involved
a
number
of
counts,
but
some
of
the
counts,
the
substantive
counts,
involved
the
actual
beggs
lab,
and
those
counts
ran
up
to
and
included
july
13th,
1987,
but
extended
no
farther.
he
was
also
charged
with
a
conspiracy
which
extended
from
may
1,
1987,
through
the
beggs
period
and
into
the
period
of
his
activities
in
missouri
through
august
31st.
the
district
court
held
that...
over
his
objection
that
this
constituted
double
jeopardy
because
he
had
previously
been
prosecuted
for
attempt
in
missouri,
the
district
court
said
no,
you're
being
prosecuted
for
different
crimes,
separate
offenses,
and
therefore
there's
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed,
holding,
in
reliance
on
this
court's
decision
in
grady
against
corbin,
that
in
fact
the
prior
prosecution
for
attempt,
based
on
the
late
august
activities
in
missouri,
barred
a
prosecution
for
both
substantive
offenses
relating
to
the
beggs
operation
and
also
for
the
conspiracy
throughout
the
entire
summer.
the
court's
rationale
was
that
this
was
successive
prosecution
for
the
same
conduct.
this
was
a
phrase
that
the
court
used
again
and
again.
the
court
focused
on
the
fact
that
in
the
missouri
case
the
evidence
of
the
beggs
operation
had
been
introduced
to
prove
intent,
and
in
the
oklahoma
case
evidence
of
the
missouri
transaction
had
been
introduced
as
part
of
the
proof
of
the
conspiracy,
but
because
the
evidence
overlapped,
the
court
regarded
that
as
sufficient
to
constitute
successive
prosecution
for
the
same
conduct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
no,
your
honor.
an
allegation
of
simply
factual
assertions
in
the
indictment
that
could
have
been
thrown
in
would
have
been
surplusage,
as
long
as
he
was
not
in
jeopardy
for
the
beggs
operation.
in
other
words,
if
they
had
said
in
the
missouri
indictment,
if
they
had
had
a
charge
which
related
to
the
beggs
operation,
yes,
he
would
have
been
in
jeopardy.
he
could
have
been
separately
convicted
for
that.
or,
if
they
had
treated
the
beggs
operation
as
part,
let's
say,
of
an
overall
conspiracy.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
understand.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
is
an
element,
but
even
if
the
beggs
evidence
had
been
the
only
evidence
that
had
been
available
to
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
intent
in
the
missouri
case...
it's
a
little
hard
to
imagine
that,
because
the
intent
could
be
inferred
from
the
activities
themselves,
almost
certainly.
but
in
any
event,
supposing
that
that
were
the
only
evidence,
still
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
use
of
evidence
of
conduct
to
prove
another
offense.
you're
not
talking
about
an
offense
that...
for
which
you
are
being
prosecuted.
that
is
the
key,
we
think,
to
the
double
jeopardy--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you
are.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
you
are
definitely
proving
intent,
but
what's
important
is
you
are
not...
you're
not
in
effect
reprosecuting
him
for
something
for
which
he
has
been
prosecuted
before.
in
other
words,
when
the
missouri...
when
the
oklahoma
case
came
up
you
weren't
reprosecuting
him
for
an
offense
for
which
he
was
in
jeopardy
in
missouri.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
we
think
the
holding
does
not
apply.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
in
the
language
that
grady
used,
and
the
question--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it's
not
the
holding.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
was
a
dissent
by
judge
anderson,
and
we
believe
that
judge
anderson's
analysis
of
grady
against
corbin
is
very
insightful
and
we
think
that
his
analysis
is
the
correct
approach
to
the
application
of
grady
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
it
does
squarely
fit
this
case.
it
could
be...
you
could
read
that
language
broadly
enough...
i
think
it
would
be
an
extremely
broad
reading
of
the
language.
you
could
read
it
broadly
enough
to
cover
this
case,
but
i
think
if
you
do
so
then
you
would
construe
grady
against
corbin
as
having
overruled
a
hundred
years
of
double
jeopardy
law,
and
i
don't
think
that
grady
against
corbin--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
that
the
majority
did--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
majority
did
deny
it
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
majority
said
is
we
are
not
doing
anything
radical
in
this
case,
we
are
simply
applying
the
principles
of
illinois
against
vitale
and
harris
against
oklahoma,
which
are
essentially
talking
about
a
kind
of
lesser
included
offense
law.
what
grady
does...
and
i
think
this
language
is
consistent
with
it.
what
grady
does,
in
our
view,
and
what
we
urge
upon
this
court
as
the
proper
construction
of
grady,
if
the
court
approaches
grady
with
the
intent
to
not
have
grady
overrule
all
of
the
prior
cases
involving
conspiracy
and
substantive
offenses
with
respect
to
successive
prosecutions...
what
we
urge
this
court
to
construe
grady
to
mean
is
that
this
language,
conduct
constituting
an
offense
that
is
used
to
establish
an
element
of
a
later
offense,
is
simply
a
way
of
talking
about
a
lesser
included
offense.
in
other
words,
the
lesser
offense,
the
first
offense
prosecuted
in
the
case
of
grady,
has
to
be
proved...
reproved
entirely,
and
it
will
have
to
establish...
it
will
have
to
constitute
the
entire
element
of
a
later
offense.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
hold
may
not
be
an
accurate
description
of
what
the
actual
holding
is,
although
obviously
the
more
clearly
the
court
states
what
its
rule
is
i
think
the
more
it
imposes
on
the
lower
court
certainly
the
obligation
to
attempt
to
accommodate
that
rule
to
their
decisions.
and
that
has
been,
i
think,
one
source
of
confusion
among
the
lower
courts,
and
i
have
to
concede
that
there's
been
a
lot
of
confusion
about
exactly
what
that
formulation
means.
and
this
case
is
an
example
of
it.
i
think,
to
finish
my
point
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
the...
what's
important,
i
think,
about
the
way
the
court...
the
majority
viewed
grady
is
that
while
in
the
dissenting
opinion
the
point
was
made
that
grady
could
be
read
much
more
broadly,
i
think
even
the
dissenting
opinion
said
that
that
wasn't
a
necessary
reading,
although
the
dissent
anticipated
that
an
argument
would
be
made,
and
here
we
are,
that
the
argument
would
be
made
that
grady
should
apply
virtually
to
constitute
a
same
transaction
test.
but
the
majority
did
not
say
that.
the
majority
said,
in
effect,
we
are
simply
applying
the
principles
of
illinois
against
vitale
and
oklahoma...
harris
against
oklahoma,
which
again
in
our
view
is
a
way
of
signaling
that
what
the
majority
was
trying
to
do
is
to
say
this
is
really
lesser
included
offense
law.
in
any
event,
we
would--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
your
honor.
judge
newman
explicitly
construes
the
second
element,
if
you
will,
of
the
grady
test
in
a
way
that's
different
from
the
language
of
grady.
he
says
he
feels
that
it's
necessary
to
do
so,
but
he
construes
conduct
constituting
an
offense
not
to
mean
conduct
constituting
the
whole
offense,
this
concept
of
lesser-included
offense
for
which
we're
contending.
he
says
you
have
to
read
that
to
mean
conduct
constituting
an
element
of
an
offense.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
where
judge
newman
has
expanded
grady
and
in
a
way
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
language,
and
we
would
say
with
what
grady
is
really
trying
to
get
at.
again,
if
i
can--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
think
so,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
language
can
be
squared
with
vitale,
because...
but
it
isn't
obvious
that
from
reading
the
language
that
it
incorporates
only
what
vitale
says.
the
problem
is,
the
language
is
not
as
clear,
i
think,
as
the
language
that
appears
in
cases
like
harris
and
vitale,
on
which
grady
relied
and
which
we
think
grady
was
attempting,
in
a
sense,
to
codify,
but
the
language
can
be
read
more
broadly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly,
and
that
states
in
one
sentence
our
submission
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
well...
that's
right.
now,
in
this
case,
this
case,
we
submit,
before
grady
would
be
an
easy
case,
because
the
principles
governing
this
case,
the
substantive
and
conspiracy
prosecutions
in
this
case
were
very
well
established
and
they
were
simply
this:
that
conspiracy
and
related
substantive
offenses
are
always
different.
they
are
separate
offenses;
they
are
not
the
same
offense
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
two,
that
substantive
offenses
that
occur
at
separate
times
and
places
are
separate
offenses;
they
are
not
the
same
offense.
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
case
in
which
the
substantive
offenses
occur
at
separate
times.
the
substantive
offenses
related
to
beggs
occurred
in
oklahoma
on
july
13th
and
previously;
the
substantive
offense
related
to
missouri
occurred
in
missouri
in
late
august.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
is
more
difficult,
but
still,
i
think
the
point
that
i'd
like
to
emphasize
is
that
there
is
a
hundred
years
of
law
from
this
court
and
from
the
lower
courts
in
which
the
court
has
emphasized
that
conspiracy
and
the
related
object
substantive
offenses
are
separate
offenses
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
and
we
don't
think
that
grady
against
corbin
intended
to
change
that.
so
that
although
the
analysis
in
dealing
with
the
language
of
grady
is
more
complicated
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
offense,
we
don't
think
that
the
legal
point
is
more...
is
closer.
it's
more
difficult,
because
it
is
harder
to
deal
with
the
language
we
think,
but
the
legal
point
is
still
quite
clear
that
a
conspiracy
and
its
related
substantive
offense
are
separate
offenses
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
minor
respects
in
which
we
would
disagree,
but
i
think
they
fall
into
the
category
of
quibbles.
the
dissent,
just
to
give
you
an
example...
and
this
is...
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
quibbles
in
great
detail,
but
the
dissent
at
one
point
states
that
there
is
no
evidence
with
respect
to
the
missouri
transaction
that
suggests
any
continuing
conspiratorial
activity.
in
fact,
there
is
a
little
bit
of
evidence...
not
a
lot,
but
a
little
bit
of
evidence
that
does
suggest
that
the
conspiracy
was
ongoing.
one
of
the
conspirators,
mcneil,
had
a
telephone
conversation
with
the
dea
informant
which
suggested
that
mcneil
was
still
in
cahoots
with
felix.
so
there
are
a
few
minor
respects
in
which
we
would
part
company,
but
basically--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
that
it
would
certainly
require
the
court
to
reanalyze
in
calderone,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
would
change
the
result.
and
the
reason
i
think
it
would
change
the
result
is
because
in
calderone
we
submit
that
the
defendants
were
never
in
jeopardy
for
the
subsequent
conspiracy
at
the
time
they
were
prosecuted
for
the
first,
and
that's
the
gist
of
what
the
district
court
said
in
that
case.
it's
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
case
because
of
the
way
the
district
court
disposed
of
the
first
case
in
not
letting
the
case
go
to
the
jury
because
it
didn't
involve
the
same
conspiracy.
we
then
reprosecuted
for
what
we
had
been
told
was
not
at
issue
in
the
first
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
even
so
the
second
prosecution
is
barred
by
the
first.
we
would
submit
that
calderone
would
be
decided
differently
if
you
accept
the
analysis
that
we're
suggesting.
certainly
the
analysis
would
be
different.
now,
i
think
it's
important
in
talking
about
what
exactly
it
is
that
grady
has
done
to
compare
it
with
harris
and
the
felix
case
as
well,
and
to
see
what
is
really
going
on
in
this
area,
what
i
think
the
court
was
really
trying
to
do
in
grady
was
to
simply
extend
the
concept
of
lesser-included
offenses
to
cases
where
your
greater
offense
isn't
just...
is
not
just...
where
it's
not
just
possible
that
hypothetically
the
prosecution
could
prove
the
greater
offense
without
proving
the
lesser,
but
to
include
as
lesser-included
offenses
cases
where
the
greater
offense
would
necessarily
result
in
the
proof
of
the
lesser.
and
let
me
give
concrete
examples.
harris.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
felony
murder
that
was
proved
first
was
felony
murder
based
on
a
robbery.
now,
of
course,
the
argument
could
be
made
that
the
felony
murder...
that
robbery
is
not
a
lesser-included
offense
of
felony
murder,
because
of
course
the
felony
murder
could
have
been
premised
on
a
rape
or
an
arson,
but
in
that
particular
case
the
felony
murder
was
clearly
premised
on
a
robbery,
and
for
all
practical
purposes...
not
theoretically,
but
for
all
practical
purposes,
then...
the
felony
murder
was
a
greater
offense
and
the
robbery
was
a
lesser-included
offense.
that
is
the
rationale,
i
think,
of
the
court's
judgment
in
harris.
the
same
thing--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
what
the
court
concluded,
that's
right,
because--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
that...
we
don't
challenge
harris.
i
think
frankly
if
you
went
back
to
first
principles,
your
honor...
it's
not
necessary
to
challenge
harris
in
this
case.
but
if
you
went
back
to
first
principles
i
think
a
strong
argument
could
be
made,
as
we
argued
in
the
whalen
case
unsuccessfully,
that
felony
murder
is
really
not
just
an
enhanced
version
of
robbery,
or
whatever
the
underlying
felony
is,
but
it
is
a
form
of
murder.
it
is
a
way
of...
the
felony
is
a
way
of
establishing
the
state
of
mind
for
the
murder,
so
that
you
could
view
them
as
separate
offenses.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
address
that
question...
the
validity--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
i
think
so,
and
at
least
as
applied
to
a
single
transaction
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
theory
was
that
he
was
being
tried
again
for
the
two
traffic
infractions
that
he
had
previously
pleaded
guilty
to...
drunk
while...
driving
while
drunk
and
crossing
the
median
line,
because
those
had
to
be
proved,
at
least
by
hypothesis.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right,
manslaughter
and
assault.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
court...
the
state
announced
that
that
was...
those
were
two
of
the
three
ways
it
was
going
to
attempt
to
establish
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
the
extension
of
grady
over
harris,
and
that
was
the
distinction
that,
your
honor,
you
drew
in
your
dissent,
where
you
characterized
harris
as
being
a
case
in
which
the
law
itself
incorporated
essentially
the
elements
of
the
lesser
offense
without
doing
so
explicitly.
grady
extended
that
one
step
by
saying
it's
enough
if,
in
fact,
the
prosecution
will
prove
this
lesser
offense
in
order
to
establish
an
element
of
the
greater,
and
that's
what
went
on
in...
that
was
what
was
going
on
in
grady.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
because
here
all
we're
talking
about
is
evidence.
in
other
words,
the
attempt
is
neither
sufficient
nor
necessary
to
establish
any
element
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
was
sufficient,
because
the
act
that
the
state
regarded
as
being
sufficient
to
establish
the
basis
for
the
negligent
conduct
of
the
assault
was
driving
while
intoxicated.
that's
the
theory
that
the
court
pursued,
was
that
act,
that
conduct
which
constituted
an
offense,
was
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
of
assault
or
manslaughter
and
it
established
that
essential
element.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
he
had
been
tried
for
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he'd
already
pleaded
guilty
to
that
traffic
infraction.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
in
that
case.
that
was...
by
hypothesis,
that's
the
way
the
court
analyzed
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
has
to
be
the
way
that
the
prosecution
will
do
it.
it
is
not
necessary
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecution
could
hypothetically
prove
the
greater
offense
by
some
other
way.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
they
didn't
show
the
prior
crime,
your
honor;
that's
the
distinction.
they
showed
evidence
which
was
also
introduced
in
the
prior
case,
but
they
did
not
come
in
and
say,
okay,
we
are
going
to
prove
the
crime
of
attempt,
and
that
crime
is
an
element
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy,
because
attempt
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy.
it
is
neither
enough,
nor
is
it
confined
to
the
elements
of
conspiracy.
in
other
words,
attempt
would
not
establish
any
element
of
conspiracy.
it
doesn't
establish
an
agreement,
it
doesn't
establish
that
any
overt
act
was
in
furtherance
of
an
agreement,
so
it
won't
do
it.
it
doesn't
establish
an
element,
and
by
the
same
token,
attempt
goes
farther
in
one
important
respect
than
conspiracy
in
that
it
requires
proof
of
a
substantial
step
to
achieve
the
goal.
that
isn't
required
by
conspiracy,
so
you
have...
you
aren't
essentially
using
the
underlying
offense
to
establish
an
element
of
the
greater.
you're
simply
introducing
proof
which
you
happen
to
have
previously
introduced
to
prove
a
previous
prosecution.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
it
would.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
sure.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it...
the
court
never
talked
about
that
aspect
of
it.
in
fact,
under
new
york
law
dwi
does
constitute
negligent
behavior.
but
i
think
the
way
the
court--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
that
the
way
the
court
viewed
it,
and
one
could
quarrel
with
this
way
of
viewing
the
application
of
new
york
law,
but
i
think
the
way
the
court
viewed
it
was,
look
at
what
is
the
actus
reis
on
which
the
prosecution
is
premised,
and
that
actus
reis
is
drunk
while
driving,
and
that
either
that
act
is
per
se
negligence
or
that
we
will
prove...
in
addition
to
proving
that
act
we
will
prove
that
it
was
done
in
a
negligent
fashion.
so
it
was
one
element
as
the
court
construed
it,
and
this
was
consistent,
i
think,
with
the
way
the...
state
court
had
viewed
it.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
state
has
to
actually
say
that
those
are
elements
of
the
offense
and
the
fact
that
the
evidence...
if
i
understand
your
question,
that
the
evidence
may
be
established
in
a
particular
way
doesn't
make
something
an
element
of
the
offense.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
