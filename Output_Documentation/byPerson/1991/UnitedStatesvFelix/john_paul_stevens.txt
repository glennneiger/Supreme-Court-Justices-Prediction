justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
principles
you
refer
to
are
basically
the
rule
as
stated
in
blockburger,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
well
have
been
necessary,
if
there
was
no
other
way
of
proving
that
element
of
the
offense.
not
only
sufficient,
but
necessary,
because
that's
the
only--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
it
was
sufficient
in
that
sense,
you're
saying.
are
you
saying
it
has
to
be
necessary,
as
well
as
used?
it
has
to
be
the
only
way
that
you
can
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
conspiracy
part
of
it,
because
i
think
we
haven't
given
you
enough
time
on
that.
if
the...
in
the
conspiracy
case,
two
of
the
overt
acts,
17
and
18
i
think
they
were,
were
two
of
the
factual
matters
that
were
proved
in
the
first
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
had
been
the
only
overt
acts
alleged,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
mr.
bryson,
let
me,
if
i
may
just
go
back...
can
you
hear
me,
by
the
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
quite
right?
wasn't
the
evidence
concerning
the
purchases
in
august
itself
some
evidence
of
intent
to
carry...
to
manufacture?
i
mean,
isn't
it
true
that
the
government's
evidence
of
intent
consisted
of
two
parts,
one
the
prior
manufacture
in
oklahoma,
and
also
as
far
as
they
got
in
missouri?
that's
some
evidence
of
intent,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
that
isn't...
that's
a
different
argument.
i
mean,
the
argument
here,
as
i
understand
you,
is
that
in
order
to
prove
intent
they
relied
entirely
on
the
conduct
for
which
they
were
later
prosecuted...
it
was
later
prosecuted.
it
was
a
different
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
make
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument
is
that
grady
applies
even
if
the
evidence
of
the
prior
crime
or
the
subsequently
prosecuted
crime
is
only
some
of
the
evidence
that's
used
in
the
second
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
just
challenge
that
a
second.
you're
suggesting
that...
and
i
think
early
in
your
argument
you
said
that
everything
that
was
proved
in
the
missouri
trial
had
already
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
would
later
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
other
trial,
but
the
evidence
of
the
oklahoma
transactions
would
not
have
been
needed
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
sustain
the
missouri
conviction.
there
is
evidence
of
intent...
inferences
of
intent
were
drawn
from
the
oklahoma
conduct,
but
i
don't
think
the
jury
had
to
be
instructed
that
you
must
believe
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
transactions
in
oklahoma
occurred
as
the
government
indicated.
i
think
what
the
judge
must
have
told
the
jury
was
that
that
evidence,
together
with
the
contemporaneous
evidence,
must
convince
you
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
in
august
the
requisite
intent
was
present.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
not
merely
relied
heavily
on
that,
but
they
relied
solely
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
in
its
brief
the
government
argues
that
the
proof
of
the
overt
act
is
not
an
essential
element
of
the
conspiracy,
this
particular
conspiracy
offense.
it
is
under
some
conspiracies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
they?
supposing
the
jury
was
not
convinced
about
these
two
overt
acts.
they
could
still
convict,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they
didn't
prove
any
of
the
overt
acts,
but
they
were
convinced
that
the
defendant
had
entered
into
the
agreement
described
in
the
charging
part
of
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
then
i
think
you
are
agreeing
with
the
government
that
the
proof
of
the
overt
act
was
not
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
