but
intent
was
an
essential
element
of
that
offense
for
which
he
was
being
prosecuted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
this
was
shown
to
prove
the
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
here's
what
grady
thought
it
was
holding,
anyway.
there
are
very
few
cases
that
have
such
a
clear,
concise
expression
of
its
holding:
we
hold...
we
hold...
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
a
subsequent
prosecution
if
to
establish
an
essential
element
of
an
offense
charged
in
that
prosecution...
the
subsequent
prosecution...
the
government
will
prove
conduct
that
constitutes
an
offense
for
which
the
defendant
has
already
been
prosecuted.
that
squarely
fits
this
case.
it
couldn't
possibly
be
more
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
dissent
in
the
case
said,
and
the
majority
did
not
deny
that
it
was
doing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
maybe
we
can
limit
it
that
way,
but
i
don't
believe
that's
what
the
majority
was
saying.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
read
that
description--
--well,
as
a
member
of
the
majority
i'd
just
like
to
suggest
that
we
often
do
not
take
the
dissent's
interpretation
of
a
majority
opinion.
the
dissent
will
often
overstate
majority
rule
to
make
the
dissent
more
persuasive.
it
happens
all
the
time.
may
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
agree
with
judge
newman's
interpretation
of
grady
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
he
being
tried
again
for
in
grady
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
have
to
be
proved?
i
mean,
for
felony
murder
you
had
to
prove
a
felony.
you
had
to
prove
some
act,
and
you
say,
well,
the
only
one
really
at
issue
was
the
burglary,
but
i
don't
see
why
you,
in
order
to
be
held
to...
what
was
it,
a
manslaughter
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
you
have
to
have
shown
a
traffic
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
that
just
at
law
you
would
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
why
isn't
that
the
situation
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
sufficient...
or
it
wasn't...
i
just
said,
it
wasn't
sufficient
or
necessary
in
grady,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
did
it
that
way
here.
they
did
it
that
way
here
in
order
to
show
one
of
the
elements
of
the
later
offense,
the
intent,
they
chose
to
do
it
by
showing
the
prior
crime.
