justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
language
justice
scalia
read
to
you
as
the
holding
is
beyond
what
vitale
suggested.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
the
evidence
that
was
used
in
the
second
prosecution
was
used
in
the
first
prosecution
but
that
evidence
was
about
conduct
for
which
he
was
not
convicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was...
that's
vitale.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it's...
vitale
says
that
if
the
evidence
in
the
second
prosecution
related
to
conduct
for
which
he
had
been
convicted
in
the
first
prosecution--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bryson,
do
you
agree
in
every
detail
with
the
dissent
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
effect,
he
was
being
tried
again
for
a
robbery.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
so,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
had
already
been
tried
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
evidence
that
they
were
going
to
introduce
was
criminal
conduct
for
which
he
had
already
been
tried.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
what
it
was
that...
what
was
the
prior
crime
that
you
rely
on
to
prove
double
jeopardy?
is
it
the...
i
mean
the
missouri
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
specific
conduct
that
you
think
the
jury
found
to
have
constituted
an
attempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
specific
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
the
intent,
yes,
but
isn't
there
another
element
of
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't...
was
there
other
evidence
of
the
attempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't...
i
take
it
you...
you
don't
really
know
whether
the
sole
ground
for
convicting
him
in
missouri
was
the
fact
that
on
august
26th,
1987,
while
in
tulsa,
oklahoma,
the
defendant
provided
money
for
the
purchase
of
chemicals
and
equipment
necessary
in
the
manufacture
of
methamphetamine.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
certainly
wasn't...
he
certainly
wasn't...
you
can't
say
that
in
missouri
he
was
separately
convicted
for
that
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
have
been
a
crime,
but
he
wasn't
convicted
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
but
you
can't
say
that
the
jury
convicted
him
of
that
conduct
that
occurred
in
oklahoma.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
disagreed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
if
we
did
disagree,
would
you
lose,
that
that
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
we
disagreed
that
that
was
the
sole
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
no,
you
would
not
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do...
what
would
you
do
if...
what
should
the
court
do
if
it
believes
that
introducing
evidence
of
the
missouri
transaction
or
the
missouri
conviction
to
prove
overt
acts
was
wrong,
was
unconstitutional?
they
were
just
two
of
the
overt
acts
alleged
and
proved,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
should...
just
order
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
you
just
can't
rely
on
those
two
overt
acts?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
evidence
of
all
nine
of
the
overt
acts
that
the
defendant
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
instructions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
they
say
about...
did
they
say
the
jury,
to
convict,
had
to
find
an
overt
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
also
had
to
find--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
did
have
to...
was
the...
the
overt
acts
were
used
to
prove
the
agreement,
to
approve
the
conspiracy?
