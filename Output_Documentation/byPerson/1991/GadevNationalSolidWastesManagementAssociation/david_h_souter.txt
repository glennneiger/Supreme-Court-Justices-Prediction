h.

well,
did
it
expire
in
'72,
or
was
that
the
minimum
period
of
its
application.
i
thought
it
applied
whenever
a
state
government
proposed
a
supplanting
plan
of
its
own.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
12
of
your
appendix,
of
your
blue
brief.
at
page
12
and
13
of
the
appendix
it
says
that
the
period
covered
would
be
until
final
action
is
taken
by
the
secretary
with
respect
to
a
plan
submitted
by
a
state
under
subsection
(b),
or
2
years
from
december
29,
197...
ah,
whichever
is
earlier.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bliss,
assuming
that
that
would
qualify
within...
to
be
covered
by
the
text
of
subsection
18(b),
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
the
heading
to
18(b),
the
bold
print,
suggests
a
somewhat
narrower
scope,
because
the
bold
print
refers
specifically
to
state
standards
to
preempt
applicable
federal
standards.
isn't
that
a
rather
more
narrow
category
than
the
text
of
that
section
might
suggest?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
it
isn't
plain?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
a
state
standard
addressing
the
same
issue
as
a
federal
standard
is
not
enough
to
get
you
to
a
point
of
preemption.
if
the
object
of
(b)
is
displacement
of
the
federal
scheme,
then
the
mere
fact
there
may
be
two
standards,
one
state,
one
federal
addressing
the
same
issue,
does
not
get
you
to
the
conclusion
of
preemption,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
18(a)
can
be
read
simply
to
mean
that
the
act
itself
does
not...
or
the
mere
passage
of
the
act
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
state
regulation.
i
mean,
it
refers
explicitly
to
nothing
more
than
the
case
in
which
there
is
no
federal
regulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
(h)
probably
your
strongest
argument?
