mr.
john
w.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
growing
awareness
of
the
dangers
posed
by
work
on
hazardous
waste
sites
to
the
general
public
and
the
environment
prompted
the
illinois
legislature
to
enact
the
illinois
hazardous
waste
crane
operators
licensing
act
and
the
illinois
hazardous
waste
laborers
licensing
act.
these
illinois
licensing
acts
ensure
that
only
qualified
competent
people
engage
in
these
hazardous
waste
sites
in
illinois
by
demonstrating
through
training,
testing,
and
experience
their
competency.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
the
illinois
licensing
acts
preempted
under
the
osh
act,
the
occupational
safety
&
health
act
because,
in
addition
to
protecting
the
environment
and
the
public
safety,
they
also
protect
worker
safety...
workers
regulated
by
osha.
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
because
congress
did
not
intend
through
the
osh
act
to
deprive
states
of
their
historical
power
to
regulate
entry
into
occupations
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
while
we
also
urge
this
court
to
find
that
the
osh
act
does
not
preempt
any
supplemental
state
regulation,
i
would
like
first
to
draw
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
osh
act
does
not
preempt
dual
purpose
legislation
where
the
state
has
a
purpose
in
addition
to
the
worker
safety
for
protecting
the
public
and
for
protecting
the
environment.
every
other
court
of
appeals
and
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
itself
have...
they
have
considered
the
question
of
whether
the
osh
act
preempts
state
licensing
acts,
have
limited
the
preemptive
effect
of
osha,
and
have
found
osha
only
preempts
purely
workers'
health
and
safety
matters.
it
does
not
extend
to
preempt
matters
which
have
as
a
purpose
or
effect
the
promotion
of
public
health
and
safety
and
the
protection
of
the
environment.
mr.
john
w.
simon
illinois
could
have
submitted
a
state
plan,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
simon
illinois
does
not
wish
to
displace
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
standards
or
enforcement.
illinois
does
not
wish
to
regulate
the
process
and
means
by
which
work
is
done
on
hazardous
waste
sites.
illinois
is
only
concerned
with
ensuring
that
competent
people
engage
in
this
professional
in
illinois,
and
the
illinois
requirements
do
not
displace
or
interfere
with
the
federal
scheme
with
continues
to
be
in
place
in
illinois.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i
believe
the
section...
the
purpose
of
section
18
is
to
provide
a
mechanism
whereby
states
may
displace
federal
standards
and
federal
enforcement
and
a
mechanism
by
which
the
secretary
and
the
federal
government
can
grant
money
to
the
states--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--subsection--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
believe
that
subsection
(a)...
in
the
first
place,
subsection
(a)
does
not
express
intent
to
preempt.
subsection
(a)
expresses
an
intent
to
preserve
to
the
states
jurisdiction.
i
believe
that
it's...
that
section
(a)
is
explained
to
the
states
that
where
osha
has
not
promulgated
a
standard,
your
regulations
in
no
way
conflict
with
osha's
regulations.
mr.
john
w.
simon
your
regulations
may
conflict.
we
have
to
examine
your
regulations
next
to
the
osha
regulations
and
if
they
do
conflict,
then
your
regulations
are
preempted,
and
that's
exactly
how
we
think
that
the
illinois
licensing
acts
should
be
judged.
if
they
conflict
with
an
osha
standard,
they
are
preempted.
mr.
john
w.
simon
that's
correct.
osha
actually
does
not
require
any
experience
hours.
osha
only
requires
training
hours.
the
illinois
licensing
act
for
crane
operators,
hazardous
waste
crane
operators,
does
contain
a
4,000-hour
requirement.
the
4,000-hour
requirement
serves
the
legitimate
public
purpose
of
ensuring
that
crane
operators
don't
receive
their
training
on
hazardous
waste
sites.
the
osha
standard
does
not
also
require
this,
but
it
is
not
impossible
to
comply
with
the
illinois
regulations
and
the
osha
regulations
and
that
does
not
create
an
actual
conflict
under
this
court's
preemption
jurisprudence.
the--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--and
that's
a
negative
implication.
this
court
has
found,
however,
in
its
jurisprudence
that
if
you're
going
to
have
express
preemption
it
has
to
be
expressed,
and
if
you're
going
to
have
implied
preemption
the
structure
and
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
have
to
support
that...
that
inference...
and
in
this
case
the
structure,
language
and
purpose
do
not
support
that.
the
purpose
of
the
osha
act
is
to
provide
for
every
working
man
and
woman
in
the
nation
a
safe
and
healthful
conditions
of
work.
the
purpose
is
not
to
eliminate
duplicative
regulation
or
to
remove
from
jurisdiction
areas
of
state
concern.
mr.
john
w.
simon
that's
correct.
the--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--that's
right.
you
cannot
conflict
with
a
standard.
that's
all
that
section
says.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i
think
that
section
18
of
the
act
is
explaining
to
states
how
they
can...
that
they
should...
it's
encouraging
states
to
come
in
and
take
a
role
in
the
occupational
area,
and
it's
saying
where
there's
no
federal
standard
in
place
you're
not
precluded
by
any...
i
would
make
an
analogy
to
a
dormant
commerce
clause
type
thing.
there's
no...
because
osha
has
not
worked
here
we're
not
saying
that
therefore
it's
precluded
to
states.
go
ahead
and
do
it.
you're
not
in
conflict
because
there's
nothing
there,
and
where
there
is
something
there
then
we'll
look
to
whether
there's
a
conflict.
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
this
section
18(a).
i
think
that
section
18(a)
does
not
expressly
say
or
expressly
preempt
supplemental
state
laws.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--two
good
reasons.
one
of
them
is
that
they
then
displace
the
federal
regulations
and
the
federal
enforcement,
and
they
do
that
themselves.
the
second...
and
states
who
were
sensitive
to
being
told
what
to
do
by
the
federal
government
would
enjoy
this
control
over
their
own
occupational
safety
and
health
concerns.
mr.
john
w.
simon
but
it
may
not
conflict
with
the
regulation.
any
federal
regulation
as
its
written,
as
its
provided,
is
going
to
be
enforced
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
w.
simon
the
osha
regulations
then
do
not
apply
in
a
state
with
a
state
plan.
the
state
regulations
apply
in
a
state--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--when
you
say
conflict
with
it,
i
believe
you
mean
anything
that
provides
less
safety
protection
for
the
employees--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--and
that's
correct,
but
you
may
provide
more
protection
in
a
different
way.
mr.
john
w.
simon
the
second
reason
is
the
grant
to
the
states,
which
is
a
very
important
reason,
i
submit,
that
the
state
that
submits
a
state
plan
gets
90
percent
of
the
cost
of
developing
a
state
plan
from
the
federal
government
and
it
gets
50
percent
of
the
cost
of
operating
a
state
plan
from
the
federal
government,
which
is
a
very
powerful
motivation,
and
that
was
the
motivation
that
congress
offered
here
to
encourage
the
states
to
submit
the
state
plans,
was
the
federal
money.
mr.
john
w.
simon
not
under
the...
not
as
i
read
the
grants
to
the
states.
mr.
john
w.
simon
if
they're
submitting
a
state
plan,
and
they
only
submit
a
state
plan
if
they
want
to
regulate
a
matter
regulated
by
osha.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i
do
not
include
in
my
appendix
the
grant
to
the
states.
i
believe
that's
672.
it's
towards
the
end.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes.
mr.
john
w.
simon
667(h)
gives
the
secretary
authority
to
allow
a
state
to
enforce
less
restrictive
state
standards
even
after
federal
standards
are
in
place
while
the
state
is
attempting
to
come
into
compliance
and
get
its
state
plan
approved
by
the
secretary.
so
we're
not
trying
to
enforce
less
restrictive
state
requirements.
we
want
osha
to
continue
to
enforce
the
osh
requirements
in
illinois.
mr.
john
w.
simon
if
it
conflicts
with
it,
certainly
it
would...
no,
a
less
restrictive
regulation
on
the
subject,
if
osha
says
that
workers
have
to
wear
helmets
and
states
say
they
have
to
wear
goggles,
workers
can't
do
both,
certainly
the
osha
requirement
supersedes
the
state
requirement,
but
under
(h)
the
secretary
could
agree
that
that
state
could
just
require
goggles.
section
(h)...
it
says
that
the
secretary
may
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
state
under
which
the
state
will
be
permitted
to
continue
to
enforce
one
or
more
occupational
health
and
safety
standards
in
effect
in
such
state
until
final
action
is
taken.
the
seventh
circuit
went
back
and
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
found
that
an
earlier
draft
had
said
that
the
secretary
could
agree
that
they
could
enforce
more
restrictive
argument.
when
they
took
out
the
more
restrictive,
now
(h)
means
that
you
can
enforcement
less
restrictive
requirements.
the
secretary
can
agree
to
that.
that
is
an
accommodation
to
the
states.
it
is
not...
and
it
makes
sense
because
they
don't
want...
if
the
state's
going
to
have
a
state
plan,
it's
going
to
have
state
standards,
there's
no
sense
making
them
adjust
to
the
federal
for
2
years
until
their
plan
goes
back
and
then
they
can
go
back
to
their
own
plan.
mr.
john
w.
simon
for
the
period
while
the
state
plan
approval
is
pending.
mr.
john
w.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
simon
exactly,
your
honor,
and
it
doesn't
have
any
more
continuing
effect.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i
think
the
terms
of
it
state
specifically
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
and
i
thought
it
was
set--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--the
illinois
licensing
acts
which
promote
public
safety
and
environmental
protection
in
addition
to
occupational
safety
should
not
be
preempted
by
the
osh
act.
the...
if
this
court
does
find
preemption
in
some
cases,
the
court
nevertheless
should
not
preempt
a
dual
purpose
statute
like
licensing
acts.
it
should
rather
consider
whether
it
has
a
legitimate
purpose
and
whether
it
has
selected
a
means
which
is
plausibly
related
to
that
legitimate
purpose.
this
squares
with
the
approach
of
the
other
circuit
courts
that
have
addressed
this
issue
and
it
also
squares
with
this
court's
precedent
and
jurisprudence
in
preemption
cases.
the
case
that
i'm
thinking
of
where
i
drew
this
test
from
is
the
northwest
pipeline
case,
where
this
court
recognized
the
permissible
purpose
of
regulating
production
of
natural
gas
and
this
court
recognized
an
impermissible
purpose
of
regulating
the
sale
and
transmission
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
the
kansas
statute
in
that
case
this
court
found
had
a
permissible
purpose
of
regulating
production
and
a
means
which
plausibly
was
related
to
that
purpose,
and
it
affirmed
the
validity
of
that
kansas
regulation
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
impacted
on
the
sale
and
transmission
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
the
area
prohibited.
the
illinois
licensing
acts
similarly
have
a
permissible
purpose.
clearly
osha
did
not
preempt
states
rights
to
regulate
its
environment
in
public
safety.
mr.
john
w.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
simon
the
occupational...
osha
regulates
occupational
safety
exclusively.
the
secretary
of
labor
has
in
fact
disclaimed
any
responsibility
or
any
authority
to
regulate
public
health
and
safety
or
the
environment,
yet
public
health
and
safety
and
environmental
concerns
are
clearly
present
on
hazardous
waste
sites
and
illinois
is
attempting
to
address
these
concerns
which
also
further
osha's
purpose
of
worker
safety
with
these
licensing
acts
by
requiring
competency
in
the
individuals
that
engage
in
these
professions.
mr.
john
w.
simon
illinois
gets...
one,
that
it
gets
a
superior
form
of
enforcement,
because
it's
very
easy
to
enforce.
licensing
acts
are
a
superior
means--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
think
that
the...
illinois,
when
it's
regulating
its
environment,
is
not
limited
to
accept
what
osha
does
to
regulate
workers,
and
illinois
here
wants
a
licensing
scheme
because
that's
the
way
in
which
illinois
historically
regulates
public
safety
for
professionals.
mr.
john
w.
simon
the
illinois
regulation...
i
believe
the
public
benefits
more
from
the
illinois
regulation,
and
i
believe
the
environment
benefits
more
from
the
illinois
regulation.
mr.
john
w.
simon
illinois
require...
training
requirements
will
be
implemented
by
the
illinois
environmental
protection
agency
which
will
approve
training
courses
and
they
have
as
their
principal
concern
environmental
concerns,
whereas
the
osha
certification
of
training
would
go
towards
exclusively
matters
to
protect
workers.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes.
they...
many...
most
of
them
are
on
the
same
sites,
and
we
don't
want
to
discount
the
fact
that
we
believe
we
do
benefit
from
those
regulations,
but
we
don't
think
the
fact
that
we
benefit
from
that
precludes
us
from
requiring
the
additional
training
which
we
think
furthers
our
public
health
and
safety
environmental
purposes.
not
only
does
illinois
submit
that
as
dual
purpose
legislation
the
illinois
licensing
acts
are
not
preempted
by
the
osh
act,
but
we
submit
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
osh
act,
in
light
of
this
court's
preemption
jurisprudence,
reveals
that
states...
that
no
supplemental
legislation
is
preempted
provided
it
does
not
conflict
with
the
osh
act.
this
court
begins
its
preemption
analysis
with
the
presumption
that
states'
historic
exercise
of
their
police
powers
to
protect
their
safety
is
not
to
preempt
it
unless
that
was
the
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress.
illinois'
licensing
acts
enjoy
this
presumption
of
validity.
this
court
finds
express
preemption
only
when
the
explicit
preemptive
language
is
used
in
the
statute.
no
explicit
preemptive
language
is
used
in
this
osha
act
anyway.
mr.
john
w.
simon
you
do
if
congress
delegated
that
authority
to
the
agency.
in
this
case,
congress
did
not
delegate
authority
to
the
agency
to
preempt,
and
in
this
case
osha
did
not
attempt
to
preempt
with
the
hazardous
waste
operation
standard.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i
don't
believe
it
would
make
a
difference
under
the
argument
that
i
make,
because
i
don't
believe
that
congress
delegated
authority
to
osha
to
preempt
a
state
supplement--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
think
that
in
matters
of
the...
the
case
that
i
found
that
directly
answers
this
question
was
united
states
v.
north
dakota,
where
this
court
said
that
in
matters
of
whether
congress
has
given
power
to
the
state
or
to
the
federal
government
to
preempt,
the
court
looks
to
the
command
of
congress
directly
and
does
not
give
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
command
of
congress,
and
i
think
this
court
should
do
that
in
this
case
as
well.
mr.
john
w.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
simon
if
that
were--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--if
that
were
the
command
of
congress,
then
i
think
you
have
to
follow
the
command
of
congress.
mr.
john
w.
simon
well,
in
this
case
it's
not
a
question,
because
in
this
case
the
agency...
osha
has
not
asked
the
court
to
interpret
this...
their
regulation
as
preempting
supplemental
state
regulation.
mr.
john
w.
simon
the
government
has
taken
a
position
in
this
case
which
is
contrary
to
the
historic
position
taken
by
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration.
in
an
instruction
interpreting
the
preemptive
effect
of
section
18(a)
on
state
without
state
plans,
the
occupational
health
and
safety
administration
took
the
position
that
their
state
law,
which
was
on
its
face
directed
at
a
class
of
persons
larger
than
employees,
was
not
preempted
by
an
osha
occupational
standard.
i
think
that
their
position
in
this
case
is
a
litigation
position,
and
even
if
the
position
of
osha
should
be
given
deference
it
would
be
their
historic
position
interpreting
their
own--
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
is
room
for
supplemental
state
legislation
over
matters
of
occupational
safety
as
recently
as
1985.
in
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
v.
massachusetts,
where
this
court
stated
that
states
possess
broad
authority
under
their
police
powers
to
regulate
an
employment
relationship
to
protect
workers
within
the
state,
child
labor
laws,
minimum
and
other
wage
laws,
laws
affecting
occupational
health
and
safety
are
only
a
few
examples.
the
osh
act
is
not
intended
to
remove
the
area
of
occupational
safety
and
health
from
the
state
legislation,
and
it
should
not
be...
and
a
clear
reading
of
the
language
of
the
act
does
not
support
any
preemption
of
supplemental
law
which
does
not
conflict
with
osha.
mr.
john
w.
simon
that's
correct.
if
it
has
the...
well,
excuse
me.
if
it
has
the
effect
of
regulating
job
site
safety
practices
then
i
would
concede
that
that
would
be
an
occupational
standard,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
an
occupational
standard,
if
it
does
not
conflict
with
the
osha
act,
is
preemptive.
i'd
point
out
that
our
training
requirements
are
not
occupational
standards,
because
osha...
the
congress
gave
authority
to
regulate
occupational...
gave
authority
to
promulgate
standards
under
655,
whereas
it
gave
authority
to
the
secretary
to
issue
training
requirements
under
670.
mr.
john
w.
simon
no,
i
do
not
agree
that
our
standards
regulate
job
site
safety
practices.
i
do
not
agree
that
we
have
standards,
either.
ours
is
a
licensing
act,
which
i
think
is
distinct
from
a
standard.
it
does
not
displace
any
of
the
osha
standards.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
john
w.
simon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
is
correct
when
he
was
saying
he's
asking
the
court
to
create
a
new
category
of
preemption,
and
i
really
think
that
the
state...
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
preemption
has
been
clear
that
you're
not
to
preempt...
that
congress
does
not
preempt
state
law
unless
there
was
the
clear...
its
clear
manifest
purpose,
and
it
say
so
expressly,
or
if
it
is
evident
under
the
categories
of
implied
peremption
which
this
court
has
traditionally
set
forth
and
been
consistently
followed.
i
think
that
to
create
a
new
category
of
inferred
express
preemption
would
not
only
create
confusion
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court,
but
it
would
certainly
expand
the
preemptive
effect
of
federal
regulations,
and
we
would
have
lower
courts
preempting
state
laws
left
and
right
because
of
inferring
express
preemption,
and
i
strongly
discourage
the
court
from
following
that
path.
the
illinois
licensing
acts
are
a
historic
exercise...
or,
an
exercise
of
the
state's
historic
police
power
to
protect
the
public
and
the
environment,
and
this
means
of
requiring
competency
for
those
engaged
in
these
hazardous
occupations
is
a
longstanding
mechanism
to
accomplish
its
public
safety
purpose,
and
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
osha
act
to
preclude
states
from
pursuing
this
means
to
protect
the
public
safety.
mr.
john
w.
simon
66--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--the
section
that
you
just
read
starts
out
with
when...
it
talks
about
products
in
interstate
commerce,
so
we
talk
about...
we're
dealing
with
products
there.
mr.
john
w.
simon
the
illinois
hazardous
wastes
licensing
acts
do
not
deal
with
products
whatsoever.
i
don't
think
that
(c)(2)--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
believe
that
a
product...
a
requirement
on
a
product
to
be
manufactured
differently
than
the
product
is
required
in
all
of
the
other
states,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
a
conflict,
and
i
believe
that
what
they're
saying
there
is
that
under
a
state
plan
where
the
states
are
entitled
to
enact
conflicting
legislation
if
the
secretary
agrees
that
it
provides
at
least
as
much
worker
safety,
they're
saying
except
with
regard
to
products
in
interstate
commerce.
those
products,
the
secretary
cannot
approve
them
if
they're
going
to
create
a
conflict
because
those
products
can't
circulate
to
other
states.
the
purpose
of
the
osh
act
is
to
provide
safe
and
healthful
working
conditions
for
every
working
man
and
woman
in
the
country.
that
purpose
is
not
frustrated
by
the
illinois
licensing
acts,
it's
furthered
by
the
illinois
licensing
acts.
the
training,
competency
and
testing
requirements
of
the
illinois
licensing
acts
do
not
conflict
with
any
of
the
requirements
of
the
osh
hazardous
waste
operation
standard,
which
will
remain
in
place,
enforced
by
osha.
for
these
reasons,
i
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision--
