mr.
donald
t.
bliss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
morning
i
hope
to
establish
three
points.
first,
the
language,
structure,
and
purpose
of
the
osh
act
expressed
congress'
intent
to
allow
states
to
duplicate
or
supplement
an
osha
standard
only
pursuant
to
an
approved
state
plan.
second,
the
preemptive
reach
of
the
osh
act
as
applied
by
the
court
below
is
narrow.
it
applies
only
to
state
occupational
health
and
safety
standards
that
clearly
directly
and
substantially
intrude
upon
the
osha-regulated
employer-employee
obligations
in
a
specific
work
place.
and
third,
when
a
state
occupational
standard
also
serves
other
purposes,
for
example
environmental
protection,
the
seventh
circuit
test
would
preclude
only
those
provisions
of
state
law
that
directly
intrude
upon
the
federally
regulated
work
place.
under
state
law
severability
analysis,
other
provisions
would
remain
valid.
unlike
the
other
circuits
that
have
addressed
this
issue,
the
seventh
circuit
avoids
weighing
the
legitimacy
or
substantiality
of
various
state
legislative
purposes,
and
it
focuses
instead
on
the
effect
of
the
state
standard
on
the
osha-regulated
work
place.
it
is
important
here
to
look
at
what
illinois
actually
did,
in
addition
to
what
illinois
purports
to
be
the
purpose
of
these
statutes.
these
illinois
statutes
establish
training,
experience,
and
certification
conditions
specifically
for
workers
at
hazardous
waste
sites
who
already
are
subject
to
comprehensive
osha
standards
that
address
the
very
same
topics
for
the
very
same
employees.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
yes,
he
could,
justice
stevens.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
the
osha
act
specifically
reserves
to
the
state
common
law
remedies.
they
are
not
preempted,
and
a
common
law
remedy
is
not
a
standard,
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
preempted
by
the
osha
act,
and
section
4(b)(4)
provides
another
reason
to
demonstrate
that
when
congress
decided
to
reserve
specifically
powers
to
the
state
it
said
so
quite
precisely,
and
common
law
tort
actions
arising
out
of
employment
was
one
of
the
areas
expressly
reserved
to
the
states
by
the
statute.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
it's
section
4(b)(4).
you'll
find
that
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent's
brief
2(a),
653(b)(4).
the
trial
court
below
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
and
those
are
preserved
to
the
state--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--these
are
statutory
rights
and
duties
that
arise
out
of
injuries,
disease,
or
death
of
employees
arising
out
of
employment,
and
it's
specifically
intended
to
address
those
rights
to
which
you
referred
in
which
you
may
have
a
personal
right
to
bring
an
action
for
negligence
and
so
forth,
and
they
do
not
address
the
osha
standards--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--that
certainly
would
be
a
closer
question,
but
in
our
view
if
it
establishes
a
standard
that
directly
regulates
worker
health
and
safety
it
would
be
preempted
by
the
osha
act.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
the
basis
for
the
distinction
is
that
if
the
state
statute
establishes
a
standard
that
regulates
worker
health
and
safety
by
establishing
conditions
of
employment
that
constitute
a
standard,
then
it
would
be
preempted
by
the
osha
act
expressly.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
conditions
for
liability
would
raise
a
separate
and
more
difficult
question,
but
it,
too,
would
be
preempted
if
the
direct,
substantial
effect
of
it
is
to
intrude
into
employer-employee
obligations
in
the
work
place
as
they
are
regulated
by
the
osha
standard.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
the
standard
would
regulate
prospectively.
it
would
establish
the
standards
against
which
the
employee's
practices
should
be
measured,
and
that
would
be
preempted.
the
common
law
action
under
tort
claiming
negligence
would
be
a
remedial
action
that
would
be
preserved
by
this
section
4(b)(4).
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
that
is
the
direction...
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
express
preemption
of
osha.
however,
the
state
cannot
avoid
the
congressional
reach
of
preemption
simply
by
choosing
a
different
form
over
substance.
the
court
has
to
look
specifically
at
what
the
state
actually
does,
and
if
the
effect
of
a
state's
action
is,
as
it
is
here,
to
directly
and
substantially
intrude
into
employer-employee
obligations
that
are
already
governed
by
osha
standards,
then
regardless
of
the
form
of
the
state
action,
it
would
be
preempted,
but
the
court
would
look
at
the
form
and
the
direct
effect
of
what
the
state
does
on
operation
of
federal
law,
not
the
characterization
that
the
state
may
ascribe
to
the
action
that's
taken.
here,
the
illinois
statute
states
on
its
face
an
articulated
purpose
to
promote
job
safety
and
to
protect
life,
limb,
and
property.
let
me
turn
to
the
first
point...
express
preemption.
simply
because
congress
has
not
chosen
to
use
mandatory
words
of
prohibition
does
not
make
its
intent
less
clear.
read
in
its
entirety,
section
18
of
the
osh
act
sets
forth
an
explicit
framework
for
cooperative
federalism
in
which
states
may
regulate
freely
in
areas
where
there
is
no
federal
standard,
but
where
there
is
a
federal
standard
they
may
assume
responsibility
for
developing
and
enforcing
standards
only
by
obtaining
federal
approval
of
a
state
plan.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
language
of
section
18
in
its
entirety
is
explicit
language
that
expressly
preempts
osha
standards
regulating
worker
health
and
safety
relating
to
the
issue
addressed
by
the
federal
standard.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
this
is
very
definitely
a
case
of
express
preemption.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
the
preemptive
language
is
in
section
18(a),
where
it
specifically
reserves
to
the
states--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--except
where
no
standard
is
in
effect.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
reading
section
18(a)
and
section
18(b)
together,
and
section
18--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--but
it
makes
clear
that
if
the
state
wishes
to
develop
any
standard...
it
doesn't
say
exclusive
responsibility,
but
if
the
state
wishes
to
develop
any
standard,
it
must
submit
a
plan
for
approval
by
the
secretary,
and
reading
18(a)
and
(b)
together,
the
only
logical
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
it
is
that
the
states,
if
they
wish
to
regulate
in
areas
subject
to
a
federal
standard,
must
seek
approval
of
a
plan,
and
this
is
further
supported
by
subsection
(h).
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
the
statute
has
no
provision
to
allow
for
supplementation.
indeed,
congress
considered
language
in
osha
legislation
that
was
introduced
by...
or
proposed
by
the
nixon
administration
that
specifically
would
have
provided
for
supplemental--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--the
explicit
prohibition
we
find
can
be
inferred
from
the
language
structure
and
purpose
of
the
act.
the
purpose
of
the
act
clearly
was
to
ensure
coordinated,
cooperative
federalism.
it
was
to
ensure
that
where
the
states--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--implied...
express
preemption
can
be
derived
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
even
if
there
is
not
the
magic
word
of
prohibition.
if
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
speaks,
and
the
structure
and
purpose
of
the
statute
clearly
speak
to
preempt
the
states
from
issuing
supplemental
regulation,
we
believe
that
is
a
form
of
express
preemption.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
well
we...
for
example,
in
pacific
gas
and
electric
at
461
u.s.
at
210,
we
believe
the
reservation
of
authority
to
the
states
concerning
everything
except
radiological
safety
hazards
was
construed
to
mean
that
the
states
were
preempted
and
regulated--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--in
that
context,
the
language
in
the
court
supports
that
proposition,
and
we
think
in
other
cases
like
jones
v.
rath
packing
the
language
of
the
court
does
not
expressly
prohibit
action,
and
yet
the
inference
has
been
made
from
the
language
that--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
hope
that
you
would
look
at
this
first
as
explicit
language
in
the
statutes
and
in
the
structure
of
section
18
and
indeed
in
other
provisions,
such
as
(4)(b)(4),
that
demonstrate
the
clear
intent
of
congress,
that
state
worker
health
and
safety
standards
should
be
preempted.
this
has
been
the
longstanding
interpretation
of
osha.
it
has
been
the
position
taken
by
every
lower
court,
including
six
different
circuits
who
have
addressed
the
issue.
indeed,
it's
the
position
taken
by
the
amicus
state
attorney
generals
and
the
afl-cio
in
briefs
supporting
the
state
of
illinois,
and
the
state
of
illinois
itself
took
this
position
before
the
seventh
circuit
below
on
page
14
and
15
of
the
briefs
they
filed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
justice
o'connor,
we
think
it's
absolutely
clear,
because
congress...
the
one
thing
congress
intended
to
accomplish
was
coordination
of
standard-setting
in
related
issues,
and
that
would
be
totally
undermined
by
what
illinois
has
done
here.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
if
the
state
can
go
off
and
regulate
piecemeal
without
coordinating
with
the
federal
government,
then
the
purpose
is
totally
frustrated...
the
objective
and
purpose
of
section
18
is
totally
frustrated.
so
you
can
reach
the
same
result--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--absolutely,
and
a
path
is
set
for
the
state
to
do
that
precisely
by
submitting
a
plan
for
approval
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
that
will
ensure
the
secretary
of
labor
will
have
to
review
it
and
ensure
that
it
is
at
least
as
effective
as
the
federal
standard,
and
in
the
face
of
products
in
interstate
commerce
the
secretary
will
have
to
make
the
judgment
whether
it's
necessary
to
meet
local
compelling
conditions
and
does
not
pose
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
under
section
18(c).
all
of
that
would
be
rendered
meaningless
if
the
state
can
regulate
piecemeal
and
ignore
the
explicit
process
set
forth
by
congress
that
requires
the
state,
if
it
wishes
to
supplement,
to
file
a
plan
with
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
(b)
talks
about
assuming
responsibility
for
developing--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--and
enforcing
standards.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
over
a
period
of
time,
but
it
would
be
a
3-year
conditional
period
in
which
there
would
be--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--that's
correct,
and
we
think
it's
a
combination
of
subsection
18(a)
and
(b)
read
together
along
with
subsection
(h)--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--that's
correct.
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
conflict.
it's
simply...
the
state
simply
has
to
have
a
standard
that
intrudes
directly
into
the
employer-employee
obligations
that
are
already
regulated
by
the
osha
standard,
and
we
think
that
test
is
indeed
a
narrow
and
appropriate
test,
because
it
asks
first
has
the
state
issued
a
worker
health
and
safety
standard,
and
osha
defines
a
standard
in
part
as
conditions
reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate
to
provide
safe
or
healthful
employment
and
places
of
employment.
well,
that's
exactly
what
illinois
has
done
here.
it's
established
conditions
of
training
and
experience
necessary
in
illinois'
judgment
to
provide
a
healthful
place
of
employment.
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
justice
souter,
we
don't
believe
that
the
heading
would
narrow
the
plain
language
and
meaning
of
the
actual--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--section
18(b),
but
in
any
event
we
accept
that
the
purpose
of
18(b)
is
to
allow
states
to
displace
federal
regulation,
and
we
accept
that
congress
in--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--we
believe
it
gets
us
to
that
conclusion
if
you
read
18(a)
and
(b)
together,
and
it
leaves
the--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--if
you
take
18(a)
and
(b)
and
(h),
(h)
for
example,
which
provided
for
this
transitional
period
that
states
indeed
could
supplement
federal
standards
but
only
for
a
2-year
period
and
only
if
the
secretary
agreed--
mr.
donald
t.
bliss
--i
think
(h)
helps...
i
think
(h)
helps,
(f)
helps...
you
have
to
read
the
entire
statute
in
context,
and
together
it
leaves
us
with
no
other
logical
conclusion
but
that
the
states,
if
they
wish
to
develop
a
standard
relating
to
an
issue
addressed
by
a
federal
standard
they
must
do
it
through
the
planned
process.
osha
leaves
the
states
three
options.
they
can
regulate
in
areas
where
there
is
no
federal
standard.
they
can
regulate
the
environment
and
public
safety
directly
and
not
by
the
means
of
regulating
corporate
health
and
safety,
or
they
can
submit
a
state
plan.
they
have
three
alternatives.
in
this
case,
illinois
has
rejected
all
three
alternatives
and
done
the
one
thing
that
section
18
would
deny
it,
namely
to
regulate
piecemeal
in
an
area
without
a
state
plan
where
there
is
a
federal
standard
already
in
place,
and
indeed
in
this
case
the
second
question
that
the
seventh
circuit
would
ask
is
does
the
state
standard
regulating
worker
occupational
safety
relate
to
an
issue,
and
osha
can
define
that
issue
with
an
effort
to
accommodate
federalism.
as
you
know,
under
federal
executive
order
osha
seeks
to
try
to
accommodate
the
state's
interest
to
the
greatest
extent
possible
and
can
define
the
standard
in
a
narrow
way
so
as
not
to
intrude
on
general
purpose
or
obligation
state
laws,
and
here,
however,
the
issue
is
the
regulation
of
hazardous
waste
workers
at
hazardous
waste
sites,
which
is
precisely
the
issue
that
illinois
addresses.
indeed,
illinois
statute
is
more
narrow
than
the
osha
standard,
because
it
doesn't
apply
to
all
the
hazardous
waste
sites
that
would
be
subject
to
the
federal-standard.
finally,
the
seventh
circuit
through
its
severability
analysis
would
seek
to
preserve
those
elements
of
the
state
law
which
regulate
the
environment
or
other
issues
that
are
not
directly
and
substantially
impacting
the
operation
of
the
federal
law.
on
the
dual
purpose
regulation
issue,
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
all
the
public
benefit
that
illinois
ascribes
to
its
state
laws
derived
from
workers'
safety.
it's
only
when
you
hire
a
crane
operator
who
has
4,000
hours
of
experience,
and
that
crane
operator
presumably
then
operates
safely
and
has
fewer
accidents,
that
there
may
be
a
public
benefit
that
flows
from
that,
so
that
the
public
benefits
attributed
to
the
illinois
statute
are
exclusively
derived
from
the
workers'
safety
practices
which
are
precisely
what
is
regulated
by
osha,
and
that's
why
this
law
must
be
preempted.
in
conclusion,
the
illinois
acts
constitute
worker
health
and
safety
standards
that
address
the
very
same
topics...
training,
experience,
competency
and
certification...
that
are
addressed
comprehensively
by
the
osha
standard.
the
illinois
acts
apply
only
to
hazardous
waste
workers
who
are
subject
to
the
osha
standard.
therefore,
under
section
18,
illinois
may
not
duplicate
or
supplement
the
osha
standard
without
filing
a
state
plan.
illinois
claims
an
exemption
from
this
process
merely
because
it
has
asserted
an
additional
public
purpose
for
what
is
plainly
worker-oriented,
narrow
legislation,
but
as
i've
mentioned,
the
public
benefits
from
the
illinois
training
and
experience
provisions
are
derived
solely
from
safe
conduct
in
the
work
place,
which
is
precisely
the
issue
addressed
by
osha.
