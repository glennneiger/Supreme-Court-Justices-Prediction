chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-1676,
mary
gade
v.
national
solid
wastes
management
association.
mr.
simon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
there
is
a
very
arguable
negative
implication,
mr.
simon,
from
subsection
(a)
that
where
there
is
an
osha
standard
in
effect
there
is
preemption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
we
should
analyze
this
case
as
one
of
implied
preemption,
not
express
preemption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
(h)
set
out,
mr.
simon?
the
government
refers
that
as
a
transitional--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
expired
in
1972.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reason
you
regulate
entry
into
this
occupation
is
partly
for
safety,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
it's
a
different
kind
of
safety
than
osha
is
supposed
to
provide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
is
illinois
getting
in
addition
to
what
osha
gets
by
these
regulations,
say
at
a
hazardous
waste
site?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
could
say
that
about
an
illinois
regulation
governing
the
work
place,
that
you
require
4,000
hours
and
we
require
more
than
osha
does,
but
i
think
that
would
be
very
arguably
preemptive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
who
benefits
from
the
illinois
regulation
that
wouldn't
benefit
from
the
osha
regulations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
these
are...
we're
talking
about
the
same
hazardous
waste
site
that
is
regulated
by
both
osha
and
by
the
illinois
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
has
the
effect
of
regulating
job
site
safety
practices.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
agree
that
your
standards
do
regulate
job
site
safety
practices?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
simon.
mr.
bliss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
this
language
expressly
preempts
illinois,
do
you,
because
i
think
we've
analyzed
a
little
differently
in
cases
where
there's
express
preemption
and
implied
preemption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
this
is
a
case
of
express
preemption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
case
authority
for
the
proposition
that
you
just
stated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
treat
that
as
a
case
of
express
preemption?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
have
held
many
state
statutes
and
regulations
impliedly
preempted
and
reached
the
result
that
you
want
us
to
reach
in
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
it
helps
jurisprudence
to
try
to
push
something
over
into
the
field
of
express
preemption
where
really
the
language
isn't
expressed.
as
you
answered
justice
stevens,
you
have
to
infer
something
from
two
other
provisions.
i
would
think
that
is
not
express
preemption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kelley,
where
do
you
find
language
in
those
sections
that
says
in
so
many
words
that
a
state
shall
not
regulate
in
a
particular
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
section
doesn't
say
what
the
consequence
is
of
failure
to
submit
a
plan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
derive
that
by
implication.
i'm
not
saying
by
perfectly
sound
implication,
but
you
derive
it
nonetheless
by
implication,
not
by
express
language.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think...
your
sentence
is
a
non
sequitur.
there
are
many
statutes
that
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
can
only
make
sense
if
this
particular
state
action
is
preemptive,
but
nonetheless,
you
don't
say
it's
expressly
preemptive.
express
means
in
so
many
words,
not
clearly
or
positively.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kelley.
mr.
simon,
you
have
4
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
simon.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1676,
gade
versus
national
solid
waste
management
association
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
