justice
antonin
scalia
you
still
are
saying,
though...
i
still...
i
don't
entirely
understand
your
response
to
justice
o'connor
as
to
subsection
(a).
you're
saying
that
nothing
in
the
chapter
prevents
any
state
agency
from
asserting
jurisdiction
under
state
law
over
any
occupational
safety
or
health
issue
with
respect
to
which
a
standard
is
in
effect.
there
is
jurisdiction
even
when
a
standard
is
in
effect.
the
only
thing
you
cannot
do
is
contradict
it,
right...
is
conflict
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
that...
it
doesn't
say
that.
i
mean,
the
section
says
nothing
shall
prevent
any
state
from
asserting
jurisdiction
with
respect...
over
any
issue
with
respect
to
which
no
standard
is
in
effect.
why
would
they
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
a
state
proceed
under
(b)
if
it...
why
would
a
state
want
to
proceed
under
(b),
that
is,
assume
its
own
responsibility
for
development
and
enforcement
of
health
standards
with
respect
to
which
a
federal
standard
already
exists?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
telling
us
that
the
federal
government
doesn't
control
it
anyway.
you're
saying
even
without
going
into
subsection
(b)
a
state
can
supplement
the
federal
regulation
any
way
that
it
wants.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
think
that
osha's
going
to
let
any
plan
that
they
approve
conflict
with
federal
regulation
either,
do
you?
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter
they're
not
going
to
get
anything
approved
under
(b)
that
conflicts
with
the
federal
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
it
most
unlikely
that
osha
is
going
to
approve
any
state
plan
that
conflicts
with
a
federal
regulation.
they
may
approve
some
that
supplement
it,
but
i
can't
imagine
that
they're
going
to
approve
any
that
conflict
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
have
to
go
in
under
(b)
to
do
that.
you
can
let
the
feds
issue
their
regulations.
you
can
let
them
spend
their
enforcement
money,
and
if
you
want
anything
in
addition,
you
just
issue
supplemental
reg...
there's
no
reason
to
use
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
provision
that
governs
that?
is
that
in
your
appendix
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it's
in
your
appendix
on
page
13,
i
think...
your
brief
appendix.
you
have
672
in
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
some
preemption,
or
once
you
have
a
scheme
in
which
there
is
some
preemption
on
its
face,
do
we
give
any
deference
to
the
agency's
determination
of
what
the
precise
scope
of
that
preemption
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
osha
regulation
said
at
the
end
of
it,
moreover
no
state
shall
have
other
regulations
dealing
with
training
necessary
for
workers.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
i'm
saying...
i'm
saying
assuming
that
we
agree
that
there
is
some
preemption,
assuming
we
vote
against
you
on
that,
and
just
as
to
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
preemption,
whether
it
preempts
not
only
state
laws
directed
at
the
same
values
but
also
preempts
state
environmental
laws,
why
shouldn't
we
listen
to
osha
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
work
the
other
way,
too.
that
is,
if
osha
says
notwithstanding
these
regulations
the
states
shall
be
free
to
issue
contrary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--contrary
regulation
we
would
ignore
that,
and
we
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
would
require
the
osha
rule
to
preempt
even
though
osha
doesn't
want
it
to
preempt.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
government
is
on
the
other
side
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i
don't
understand
your
answer
at
all,
because
this
provision,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
covers
statutes
as
well
as
common
law.
it
refers
to
both,
and
he
gives
you
an
example
that
is
precisely
this
case.
it's
a
statute.
it
does
exactly
what
this
case
does,
and
for
some
reason
you
say
a
statute
is
not
covered
but
the
common
law
is.
why?
what's
the
basis
for
the
distinction.
it's
not
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
conditions
for
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
would
think
that
that's
your
answer,
and
that
would
be
the
same
whether
it's
common
law
or
statute,
wouldn't
it?
you
mean,
if
the
common
law
court
finds
that
you
need
4,000
hours
of
training
or
else
it's
negligent,
that's
okay,
but
not
if
there's
a
statute,
even
though
this
section
says
common
law
or
statutory
rights,
duties,
or
liabilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
the
state
really
has
to
do
is
do
all
this
regulation
through
the
courts
rather
than
through
the
statute.
that's
what
the
federal
government
was
concerned
about,
doing
it
through
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i...
is...
never
mind.
you're
time's
up.
thank
you,
mr.
bliss.
mr.
kelley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kelley,
maybe
we
should
have
three
categories.
maybe
we
should
have
statutory
preemption
that
is
express,
statutory
preemption
that
is
implicit,
and
what
you
might
call
occupation
of
the
field,
where
the
text
does
not
give
you
any
particular
indication
of
preemption
except
in
the
sense
that
it
demonstrates
such
a
total
regulation
of
the
area
that
you
are
willing
to
leap
to
the
conclusion
of
preemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying
653(b)(4)
does.
what
kind
of
thing
does
it
say
is
not
preempted?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
says
duties
as
well
as
remedies.
it
doesn't
say
just
remedies.
statutory...
common
law
statutory
rights,
duties,
or
liabilities
of
employers,
so
that
would
include
the
duty
for
training
your
coworkers
a
certain
number
of
hours,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
simon,
you
haven't...
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me
about
the
state's
position
here
is
i
don't
understand
why
667(c)(2)
would
be
so
concerned
about
making
sure
that
any
plan
that
the
secretary
approves
will
not
unnecessarily
disrupt
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
667(c)(2),
which
are
the
conditions
for
approval
of
the
plan,
and
it
says
the
secretary
has
to
make
sure
that
the
plan
won't
needlessly...
when
applicable
to
products
which
are
distributed
and
used
and
they
are
required
by
compelling
local
conditions
and
they
do
not
unduly
burden
interstate
commerce.
that
is
one
of
the
conditions.
that
seems
very
strange,
to
put
that
next
to
a
system
which
says,
however,
if
you
don't
want
to
have
a
state
plan,
you
can
burden
state
commerce
all
you
like,
regardless
of
local
conditions,
up
to
the
point
where
the
commerce
clause
is
violated.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
not
saying
it
applies
to
your
act,
but
it
does
go
to
whether
the
whole
act
should
be
interpreted
as
preemptive
or
not.
