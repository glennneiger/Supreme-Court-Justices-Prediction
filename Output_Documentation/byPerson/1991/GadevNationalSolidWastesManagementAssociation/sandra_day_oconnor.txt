mr.
simon,
i
suppose
illinois
could
have
submitted
a
state
plan
under
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
did
it
not
do
so,
if
it
wants
to
regulate
in
this
field?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
view
it
sounds
like
section
18(a)
is
just
superfluous
because
illinois
can
adopt
these
regulations
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
18(a)...
subsection
(a)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
appear
that
that's
just
superfluous
under
your
reading.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
implication
if
osha
has
adopted
regulations
that
are
in
conflict?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
illinois
require
4,000
hours
of
experience
for
a
license
holder
in
some
area
of
this
hazardous
waste
business,
whereas
the
osha
requirement
would
be
40?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bliss,
just
how
clear
is
it
that
congress
wanted
to
prevent
a
state
from
adopting
some
heightened
worker
safety
requirement
that
technically
could
be
complied
with
along
with
any
lesser
requirement
of
the
federal
regulation.
i
mean,
how
clear
is
the
statute
as
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
the
whole
thrust
of
section
18
is
to
indicate
that
a
state
can
have
greater
requirements
than
the
federal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kelley,
are
you
going
to
address
the
meaning
of
section
653(b)(4),
which
says
that
nothing
in
the
chapter
will
affect
common
law
or
statutory
rights,
duties,
or
liabilities
of
employers
and
employees
under
any
law
with
respect
to
injuries,
diseases,
or
death
of
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
clear
that
we
should
defer
to
state
agencies
in
matters
of
this
kind
of
preemption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
pursuant
to
its
authority
in
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
promulgated
regulations
for
the
initial
and
routine
training
of
workers
who
handle
hazardous
wastes.
subsequently,
the
state
of
illinois
enacted
two
laws
requiring
the
licensing
of
workers
at
certain
hazardous
waste
facilities.
the
respondent,
national
solid
waste
management
association,
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
federal
district
court
claiming
that
the
state
laws
were
preempted
by
the
occupational
safety
act
than
the
regulations
promulgated
under
that
act.
the
district
court
held
the
state
acts
were
not
preempted
because
they
protected
public
safety
in
addition
to
promoting
job
safety.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
preempts
all
state
law
that
constitutes
in
a
direct,
clear,
and
substantial
way
regulation
of
worker
health
and
safety
unless
the
secretary
of
labor
has
expressly
approved
the
law,
the
state
law
pursuant
to
section
18
of
the
federal
act.
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
seventh
circuit.
in
part
two
of
our
opinion,
a
plurality
of
the
court
holds
that
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
impliedly
preempts
any
state
regulation
of
an
occupational
safety
or
health
issue
with
respect
to
which,
a
federal
standard
has
been
established
unless
a
state
plan
has
been
approved
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
in
parts
three
and
four
of
the
opinion,
a
majority
of
the
court
holds
that
a
sate
law
requirement
that
directly,
substantially,
and
specifically
regulates
occupational
safety
and
health
is
an
occupational
safety
and
health
standard
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
act
regardless
of
whether
it
has
another
non-occupational
purpose.
thus,
we
hold
that
the
state
licensing
acts
in
this
case
are
preempted
by
the
federal
act
to
the
extent
they
establish
occupational
safety
and
health
standards
for
the
training
of
those
people
working
with
hazardous
wastes.
justice
kennedy
has
written
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justices
blackmun,
stevens,
and
thomas.
