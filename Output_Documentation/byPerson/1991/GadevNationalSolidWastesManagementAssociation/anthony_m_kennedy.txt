justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
really
an
identical
problem
in
explaining
the
provisions
of
667(h),
do
you
not?
i
don't
understand
what
the
necessity
for
667(h),
the
first
clause,
is
under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
doesn't
say
less
restrictive,
and
if
it's
less
restrictive...
is
it
your
view
that
a
less
restrictive
legislation
would
displace
an
osha
regulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
your
view,
the
secretary
can
agree
to
suspend
osha
regulations
under
(h).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
is
the
statutory
section
that
you
refer
to?
