justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
if
there's
no
federal...
excuse
me.
if
there's
no
federal
standard
in
effect
in,
say...
in
an
area,
and
the
state
wanted
to
develop
its
own
plan
under
(a),
could
it
get
federal
money
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
if
they're
replacing
a
federal
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
bliss,
if
a
driver
or
an
operator
of
one
of
these
cranes
complied
with
all
the
osha
standards
but
nevertheless
had
an
accident
of
some
kind,
could
an
injured
party
sue
at
common
law
on
the
theory
that
he
was
inadequately
trained?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
could
have
a
common
law
rule
that
was
more
protective
than
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
section
isn't
just
limited
to
common
law.
it's
common
law
of
statutory
rights,
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that
it
means
to
draw
a
distinction
between
common
law
rules
and
statutory
rules.
i
mean,
(4)(b)(4),
it
says
affect
in
any
other
manner
the
common
law
or
statutory
rights,
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
why
isn't
this
statutory
right
preserved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
a
state
pass
a
law
saying
that
it
shall
be
negligent
for
any
employee
to
operate
a
crane
if
he
hasn't
had
40,000
hours
of
time
on
similar
equipment?
could
it
be
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
in
the
statute,
but
not
if
it's
a
common
law
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where's
your
preemptive
language?
i
mean,
you've
read
judge
easterbrook's
opinion,
i'm
sure.
he
doesn't
find
preemptive
language,
and
i
don't,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
nothing
shall
prevent
state
agencies
from
so
forth--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right,
and
it
implies
that
if
a
standard
is
in
effect
there
may
be
preemption.
of
course,
if
there's
a
conflict
there'll
be
preemption,
but
it
doesn't
say
there
must
be
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
section
(b)
deals
with
the
situation
where
the
state
wants
to
preempt
the
federal
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
a
perfectly
logical
reason
to
say
under
(b)
if
they
want
to
displace
the
federal
plan
they've
got
to
get
an
approval,
but
if
they
merely
want
to
supplement
it,
there's
no
objection.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
provides
an
objection
to
a
supplement,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
there's
nothing
in
it
that
expressly
permits
it,
but
there's
nothing
in
it,
either,
that
expressly
prohibits
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
different
argument
from
an
express
preemption
argument.
that's
an
implied
preemption
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
(b)
doesn't
talk
about
supplementing,
(b)
talks
about
displacing
the
federal
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
entire
responsibility--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
if
they
comply
with
(b)
then
the
federal
government's
out
of
the
picture
entirely,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
(b)
provides
the
answer
to
the
question.
say
you've
got
a
lot
of
regulations
about
operating
these
cranes,
but
there's
just
nothing
said
about
whether
they
have
to
wear
protective
gloves
or
goggles
or
a
helmet
or
something,
and
the
states
let's
say
omitted
this,
we
think
they
ought
to
wear
gloves,
and
it
doesn't
conflict
with
anything,
and
you
say
they
can't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
if
there's
not
even
the
remotest
possibility
of
conflict
between
the
two
systems.
i
mean,
as
i
say,
an
example,
you
have
to
wear
a
helmet
when
you're
out
on
the
job
site,
and
that's
just
not
in
the
osha
regulation.
you
say
you
can't
do
that.
