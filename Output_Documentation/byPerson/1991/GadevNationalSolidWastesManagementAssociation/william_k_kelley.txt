mr.
william
k.
kelley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
first
try
to
allay
the
court's
concerns
regarding
the
express
preemption
question.
the
position
of
the
agency
from
day
1
has
been
that
the
act
is
expressly
preempted.
we
believe
that
is
correct.
section
18(a)
does
not
make
sense
on
the
state's
interpretation.
it's
entirely
superfluous.
it
does
not
say
that
the
state
is
free
to
enforce
a
standard
that's
not
in
conflict
with
existing
federal
standards.
it
says
the
states
are
free
to
enforce
standards
if
no
federal
standard
exists.
those
are
far
different
propositions,
in
our
view,
and
that
reading
of
section
(a)
is
confirmed
by
the
rest
of
section
18,
including
section
18(b),
section
18(f),
and
section
18(h).
mr.
william
k.
kelley
your
honor,
section
18(b)
says
that
if
a
state
wishes
to
assume
responsibility
for
enforcing
an
occupational
safety
standard
relating
to
an
existing
osha
standard,
it
shall
submit
a
state
plan.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
supplemental
state
regulation
nonetheless
relates
to
an
existing
federal
osha
standard
if
it's
connected.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
believe
that
section
18(a),
which
says
that
a
state
may
enforce
if
there
is
no
federal
standard
in
place,
is
properly
read
to
mean
that
the
state
has
to
follow
the
rest
of
the
procedures
provided
in
section
18
if
a
federal
standard
is
in
place.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
mr.
chief
justice,
our
view
is
that
the
statute
can
only
be
read...
can
only
be
made
sense
of
if
it
is
preemptive,
and
in
that
sense
we
believe
the
statute
is
expressly
preemptive.
it
is
not--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
has
said
that
express
preemption
is
demonstrated
if
that
is
the
clear
and
manifest
reading
of
the
statute.
i
would
grant
that
whether
one
wants
to
call
this
express
or
implied,
the
result
should
be
the
same
here.
when
we
same
this
is
not
implied
preemption,
we
don't
mean
that
in
a
historical
sense
of
occupying
the
field.
on
the
state's
interpretation
of
section
18,
section
18(h)
does
not
make
sense,
nor
does
section
18(f).
section
18(f)
says
that
when
the
secretary
withdraws
plan
approval
the
state
plan
will
cease
to
be
in
effect,
but
that
the
state
may
continue
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
cases
that
were
commenced
prior
to
withdrawal
of
plan
approval.
on
the
state's
theory
of
the
case,
the
only
effect
of
withdrawal
of
the
plan
approval
should
be
that
the
federal
standard
becomes
operative
again.
it
should
have
no
effect
on
the
operation
of
the
state
standards.
that
plainly,
though,
is
not
the
case.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
your
honor,
we
would
not
object
to
that.
that,
in
short,
is
our
reading
of
the
statute,
and
on
the
states
theory,
a
state
would
be
entitled
to
entirely
duplicate
the
federal
scheme
and
enforce
it
alongside
the
federal
scheme,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
congress
enacted
in
the
act.
it
seems
plain
that
the
act
envisions
one
enforcement
authority,
and
only
one,
once
osha
has
acted,
and
the
state
has
the
option
to
reassert
its
authority
if
it
wishes
under
the
state
plan
process.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
your
honor,
we
believe
that
section
4(b)(4)
further
supports
our
reading
in
the
statute
as
preemptive.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
statutory
rights
being
included
in
that
section,
we
don't
believe
that
that
means
that
a
state
may...
we
don't
believe
that
that
should
be
read
to
entirely
undermine
what
section
18(b)
erects.
it
is
not
the
same
thing
to
say
that
a
statutory
regulation
providing
that
people
shall
order
their
affairs
in
a
certain
way
is
the
same
as
a
statute
providing
a
right
to
someone
who's
been
harmed
retrospectively,
and
quite
simply,
if
the
statute
is
read
as
broadly
as
the
state
has
suggested,
at
least
if
that
section
is,
then
section
18(b)
would
be
entirely
undermined
and,
moreover,
on
our
view
if
a
common
law
cause
of
action
would
constitute
an
occupational
safety
standard
within
the
meaning
of
section
18(b),
it
also
would
be
preempted.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
says,
your
honor,
that...
i
believe
the
particular
focus
of
section
4(b)(4)
was
to
preserve
state
worker
compensation
schemes.
now,
obviously
the
language
went
further
than
that,
but
that
was
the
background
to
that
section.
with
respect
to
the
common
law
preservation
of
remedies,
that
section
seems
to
us
as
properly
read
not
to
displace
the
cause
of
action
on
the
part
of
an
employee
who's
been
injured
in
the
work
place.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
could
be
read
that
way,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
believe
it
should
be
read
that
way
for
a
two
reasons:
1)
if
it
were
read
that
way,
it
would
undermine
entirely
the
notion
of
occupational
standards
under
the
act,
and
secondly,
if
you
did
read
it
that
way,
we
believe
nonetheless
that
a
statutory
duty
would...
in
the
meaning
of
section
4(b)
would
not
be
the
same
thing
as
not...
i'm
sorry,
could
be
the
same
thing
as
an
occupational
standard
within
the
meaning
of
section
18,
section
18
meaning
the
definitional
section,
section
3(8).
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
would,
your
honor--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--and
that
is
the
reason
that
we--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--justice
white,
you're
pointing
out
that...
the
problem
with
reading
that
section
as
broadly
as
one
possibly
could,
and
if
one
were
to
read
that,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
not
only
the
state
but
every
court
that's
considered
this
issue
would
have
had
no
need
to
address
section
18
at
all,
and
would
have
read
section
4(b)
entirely
to
preserve
state
authority
in
every
instance,
and
that
clearly
is
not
the
proper
reading.
osha
has
not
changed
its
position
on
this
issue,
contrary
to
what
the
state
has
asserted
here.
from
day
one,
osha
has
said
that
the
act
is
preemptive.
from
day
one,
osha
has
said
that
dual
purpose
regulations,
if
they
affect
workers...
i'm
sorry,
if
dual
purpose
regulations,
if
they
affect
a
class
outside
of
workers
and
only
outside
workers
are
not
preempted
to
that
extent,
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
a
dual
purpose
regulation
that
regulates
worker
safety
but
has
an
incidental
effect
outside
the
work
place
are
not
preempted
and
are
not
worker
safety
standards
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
osha's
position
from
day
one
has
been
that,
and
that
is
what
we
are
here
today
saying.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
we
believe
that
it
certainly
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
act,
and--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--it
may
be
consistently...
we
don't
believe
it
was
consistently
wrong,
but
it
certainly
has
been
consistently
reasonable,
and
we
believe
therefore
is
entitled
to
deference
from
this
court.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
has
not
been
a
proposition
that
has
been
clearly
established
with
respect
to
preemption,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
deference
in
that
context
would
be
appropriate,
and
this
court
has
frequently
deferred
to
an
agency's
interpretation
of
whether
a
regulation
is
preemptive
as
opposed
to
whether
a
statute
is
preemptive,
and
we
don't
believe
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
two.
