justice
o'connor
and
does
the
federal
constitution
require
that
result?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it,
then
i
don't
understand
your
answer
in
this
court
when
you
have
a
federal
court
trying
to
determine
what
the
state
court
must
do.
i
just
don't
understand
your
answer.
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
state
wants
to
ask
prospective
jurors
whether
they
would
never
be
able
to
impose
a
death
penalty?
justice
o'connor
can
the
state
require
the
trial
judge
in
illinois
to
ask
those
questions,
or
such
a
question
of
prospective
jurors?
justice
o'connor
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
state
be
allowed
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
and
you
find
nothing
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
to
suggest
the
contrary?
justice
o'connor
was
that
dicta,
do
you
suppose,
in
that
case?
