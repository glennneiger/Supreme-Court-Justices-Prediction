justice
souter
mr.
gillis,
why
did
you
answer
yes
to
justice
stevens'
question?
why
was
it
a
proper
challenge
for
cause?
justice
souter
well,
it's
discretionary,
then,
for
him
to
say,
not
necessary
but
discretionary
for
him
to
say,
something
like
this.
the
need
for
a
deliberative
process
implies
the
need
for
individuals
who
at
least
are
capable
of
going
either
way,
depending
on
the
evidence.
this
individual
is
not
capable.
therefore,
i
will
excuse
for
cause.
but
are
you
saying
that
it's
up
to
the
judge
to
determine
whether
that
is
in
fact
his
standard
for
cause?
because
you
said
the
judge
didn't
have
to
do
it.
you
said
it
was
within
the
judge's
discretion
to
excuse
for
cause.
justice
souter
well,
are
you
saying,
then,
it
would
also
be
within
his
discretion
to
say,
i
find
that
the
person
in
fact
could
not
go
in
one
direction
regardless
of
what
the
evidence
would
be,
but
in
my
judgment,
as
long
as
this
juror
will
consider
the
evidence
before
he
comes
to
the
inevitable
result,
that
is
enough,
and
i
will
not
excuse
for
cause.
is
that
also
your
position?
justice
souter
well,
this
isn't
a
leaning.
the
judge
concludes
that
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is,
the
juror
can
only
go
one
way.
for
example,
an
eye
for
an
eye,
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
juror
always
is
going
to
impose...
vote
for
the
death
penalty
if
there
is
a
conviction.
are
you
saying
that
it
is
within
the
judge's
discretion
to
say
it
is
constitutionally
sufficient
that
the
juror
will
consider
the
evidence
even
though
the
result
of
considering
that
evidence
in
that
juror's
case
is
inevitable?
is
that
your
position?
justice
souter
so
that
if
the
outcome
is
certain,
if
no
process
of
deliberation
would
change
the
result,
then
the
judge
has
to
excuse
for
cause.
