justice
kennedy
and
it's
your
position
that
there's
nothing
in
these
instructions
that
the
state
can
point
to
to
counter
the
effect
that
you
fear.
justice
kennedy
well,
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
witherspoon
question
was
not
asked?
justice
kennedy
at
least
we
knew
there
was
one
in
ross
v.
oklahoma.
justice
kennedy
how
then
do
you
explain
ross?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
if
that
juror
had
been
seated,
that
a
reversal
would
have
been
required
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
say
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
for
a
juror
who
automatically
will
vote
for
the
death
penalty
to
sit
on
the
jury.
suppose
we
say
that.
do
you
lose
this
case?
justice
kennedy
because
even
though
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
excuse
that
juror,
you
don't
have
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
discovering
that
bias?
justice
kennedy
what
we're
asking
here
is
whether
or
not
there
must
be
a
mechanism
to
uncover
and
disclose
that
bias.
justice
kennedy
you
rely
on
both
the
voir
dire
and
the
instructions
as
being
adequate
to
guard
against
any
juror
who
would
automatically
impose
the
death
penalty.
justice
kennedy
well,
can
you
point
to
anything
specific
in
the
instructions
that
it
would
advise
a
juror
that
it
is
his
duty
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty
automatically?
justice
kennedy
what
was
your
page,
mr.
gillis?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that
the
hypothetical
is
that
this
juror
says,
i
don't
think
there
are
ever
mitigating
factors.
justice
kennedy
but
my
point
is
there's
nothing
in
the
instructions
that
would
advise
the
juror
that
this
was
an
incorrect
disposition
on
his
part.
