justice
scalia
mr.
andrews,
why
do
you
say
it
amounts
to
violating
your
instructions?
i
mean,
i
gather
the
instructions
are,
you
know,
given
your
assessment
of
what
is
mitigating,
you
should
let
him
off.
but
if
a
juror
says,
hey,
i
am
really...
i
am
a
hard
nose,
and
i
would
not
allow
any
mitigation
for
this
kind
of...
why
is
that
disobeying
the
instruction?
he
is
just
telling
the
judge,
that's
the
way
my
judgment
works.
that's
not
disobeying
the
instruction,
is
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
andrews,
you
mentioned
fundamental
fairness.
that's
sort
of
a
due
process
standard,
but
you're
also
relying
on
the
sixth
amendment,
aren't
you?
justice
scalia
how
can
you
rely...
i
thought
we've
held,
i
know
we've
held,
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
to...
that
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
trial.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
a
due
process
claim,
though,
not
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
justice
scalia
well,
again,
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
a
due
process
assertion.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
to
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury
when
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury.
justice
scalia
i'm
just
saying
i
don't
understand
it.
well,
it
wouldn't
hurt
your
feelings
to
rely
on
due
process,
would
it?
justice
scalia
but
our
law
does
not
prevent
them
from
always
imposing
the
death
penalty.
we
don't
say
that
a
juror
must
weigh
and
be
able
to
come
out
with
a
result
against
the
death
penalty.
a
juror
who
always
comes
out
with
a
death
penalty
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
juror,
as
far
as
our
case
law
is
concerned.
he
just
has
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
weigh.
we
don't
say
that
he
must
have
at
least
a
reasonable
possibility
of
coming
out
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
if
he
wants
to
weigh
and
come
out
that
way,
he
must
be
allowed
to
do
so.
justice
scalia
where
does
it
say
that
it
must
be
meaningful?
i
don't...
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
meaningful
opportunity
as
far
as
the
restrictions
placed
on
the
juror
are
concerned,
but
i
don't
think
we've
ever
said
that
the
juror
has
to
be
someone
who
will
have
a
reasonable
possibility
of
coming
out
that
way.
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
suppose
i'm
the
type
of
juror
who...
i
just
really
don't
like
any
hearsay
evidence,
including
some
hearsay
evidence
that
comes
in
under
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule,
and
i'm
just
not
persuaded
by
that
kind
of
evidence.
do
i
have
to
be
excused?
justice
scalia
no,
the
law
tells
me
to
give
it
whatever
weight
i
think
it's
entitled
to.
in
my
view
of
the
thing,
i
think
this
kind
of
evidence
is
entitled
to
zero
weight.
i'm
not
a
bad
juror
for
that,
am
i?
justice
scalia
and
you
say
the
constitution
requires
that
you
have
12
shots
at
this
rather
than
just
11
or
10
or
whatever?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
and
an
impartial
jury,
i
think
that
argument
may
go.
but
if
you're
just
talking
about
fundamental
fairness,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
fundamentally
unfair
to
allow
this
decision
to
be
made
by
12
individuals,
some
of
whom
may
have
this
attitude,
even
though
others
don't.
justice
scalia
they
consider
it.
they
just
come
down
against
your
client.
justice
scalia
mr.
andrews,
how
do
you
want
this
question
to
be
asked?
is
it
to
be
asked
with
reference
to
the
particular
crime
at
issue?
i
mean,
would
you
say
in
the
voir
dire,
you
know,
this
is
a
case
of
the
rape
and
murder
of
a,
you
know,
of
a
15-year
old,
or
something
like
that?
i
mean,
could
you
describe
the
exact
crime
before
you
ask
the
question?
justice
scalia
should
be
imposed
for
what?
it's
hard
for
anybody
to
answer
that
question.
i
mean,
what
crime
are
we
talking
about
here?
shoplifting?
justice
scalia
what
if
the
juror
says,
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
murder?
how,
you
know,
how
gory
and
heinous
it
was.
justice
scalia
and
you
don't
think
counsel
would
follow
up
with,
well,
let
me
describe
to
you
this
murder,
and
then
the
circumstances
of
the
murder--
justice
scalia
--so
you
would
just
describe
the
nature
of
the
offense,
murder,
or
whatever--
justice
scalia
suppose
enough
of
the
facts
are
described.
i
mean,
let's
say
adolf
hitler
is
put
on
trial,
and
the
jury
knows
there
is
somebody
who's
been
guilty
of
the
murder
of
millions
of
people.
all
right?
and
you
think
it
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
if
all
12
jurors
thought,
gee,
you
know,
i
don't
frankly
care
what
mitigation
you
want
to
put
in,
death
penalty
is
appropriate
for
this,
and
that's
the
way
i'm
going
to
vote.
that's
a
basically
unfair
trial?
justice
scalia
well,
not
all
the
mitigation.
you
don't
know
anything
about
mitigation
at
all.
all
you
know
is
more
than
that
it's
first
degree
murder.
you
know
the
number
of
murders.
so
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
only...
it's
when
you
only
know
the
degree
of
the
crime,
is
that
it?
you
cannot
know
anything
more
than
this
is
murder.
what
if
you
tell
them
it's
a
murder
of
eight
people,
and
then
you
have
a
juror
who
says,
if
he
killed
eight
people,
he
ought
to
die.
that's
unfair.
justice
scalia
i
can't
keep
an
open
mind
if
this
person
has
killed
several
million
people.
does
that
make
me
a
biased
juror?
justice
scalia
the
state's
complaint
in
witherspoon
was
not
that
the
juror
would
never
impose
the
death
penalty
at
the
penalty
stage.
it
was
rather
that
a
jury
who
was
that
much
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
would
not
convict,
right?
now,
the
defect
that
you
claim
in
this
case
would
not
produce
a
juror
who
would
come
out
the
wrong
way
on
the
guilt
phase,
would
it?
justice
scalia
well,
tell
me,
is
the
state
wrong
about
that?
why
would
a
person
who--
justice
scalia
--am
i
going
to
convict
somebody
just
so
i
can
impose
the
death
penalty
on
somebody?
justice
scalia
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
scalia
so
witherspoon
is
really
a
different
situation.
you
have
a
juror
who
cannot
deliberate
impartially
on
the
guilt
phase.
