chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-5118,
derrick
morgan
v.
illinois.
mr.
andrews,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
a
part
of
your
submission,
mr.
andrews,
kind
of
sauce
for
the
goose,
sauce
for
the
gander,
that
since
the
state
is
entitled
to
ask
witherspoon/witt
types
of
questions
to
jurors
to
see
if
they
would
ever
impose
the
death
penalty,
you
should
be
able
to
ask
similar
questions
kind
of
pointing
in
the
other
direction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
would
your
question
bring
it
out
any
more
subtly
or
more
discreetly?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
going
to
find
a
fair
amount
of
people,
i
dare
say,
who
answer
no
to
that
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
yet
are
very
likely
to
find
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
a
person
who
is
perfectly
willing
to
follow
the
instructions,
but
if
they
were
questioned,
they
said,
you
know,
i
really
am
not
much
moved
at
all
by
this
evidence
of
an
abused
childhood.
you
know,
i
had
an
abused
childhood.
i
rose
above
it.
i
think
it's
all
a
lot
of
bunk
as
mitigating
circumstance.
if
they
want
to
put
in
some
other
kind
of
mitigating
evidence,
that's
fine,
but
that
just
doesn't
move
me
at
all.
should
he
be
excludable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
going
to
be
the
next
step
if
we
rule
in
your
favor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
statement
of
the
interviewer
is
admissible
in
the
collateral
proceedings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
andrews.
mr.
gillis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gillis.
mr.
andrews,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
for
every
possible
challenge
for
cause
there
must
be
voir
dire
directed
to
that
possibility?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
bias
or
partiality?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
a
trial
judge
didn't
cover
it?
do
you
say
there
would
be
constitutional
error
for
him
not
to
allow
some
sort
of
a
voir
dire
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
andrews.
the
case
is
submitted.
