justice
white
is
that
question...
would
that
question,
is
it
really
asking,
will
you...
would
you
always
impose
a
death
penalty,
even
if
you
are
instructed
to
weigh
mitigating
and
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
white
so,
in
short,
it
does
cover
that...
it
does
mean
would
you
disobey
your
instructions.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
they
said,
and
satisfied
the
court,
yeah,
we'll
obey
our
instructions.
but
then
at
the
end
of
the
weighing,
there's
all
these...
still
an
area
of
discretion,
isn't
there?
justice
white
but
the
question
wasn't
just
narrowed
to
that.
justice
white
or
it
wasn't
narrowed
to
whether
where
you
have
discretion,
whether
you
would
always
vote
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
somebody,
any
juror
who
said,
i
won't
obey
my
instructions,
is
going
to
be
thrown
off,
isn't
he?
he's
not
going
to
answer
yes
to
that.
justice
white
would
you
say
you're
entitled
to
have
a
question
asked
of
jurors,
do
you
favor
the
death
penalty?
would
you
lean
towards
imposing
the
death
penalty
in
any
case,
or
not?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
in
the
state
courts
of
illinois
the
judge
voir
dires
the
jury
all
the
time?
justice
white
would
it
have
satisfied
you
if
the
judge
was
willing
to
ask
the
jury,
do
you
swear
to
follow
your
instructions,
including
the
instruction
to
weigh
any
mitigating
evidence
against
the
aggravating
evidence?
justice
white
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
would
it
have
satisfied
you
if
the
judge
says,
well,
i'll
ask
this
amended
question.
would
you,
despite
your
instructions
to
the
contrary,
always
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
white
were
you
trial
counsel?
justice
white
have
you
tried
death
cases?
justice
white
how
often
would
you
predict
that
some
juror
is
going
to
answer
yes
to
your
question?
justice
white
you
speak
about
these
people
as
though
they
were
really
quite
a
group
of
people.
justice
white
of
course,
if
there
are
one
of
these
persons
who,
if
you
didn't
have
your
question
asked
and
there
was
one
of
these
always
will
give
the
death
penalty
people
on
the
jury,
of
course,
he
couldn't
control
the
verdict
just
by
voting
for
the
death
penalty
alone.
justice
white
and
it's
different
on
the
other
side,
though.
in
the
witherspoon
case,
in
illinois,
a
single
person
could
avoid
a
death...
could
negate
a
death
penalty.
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
are
you
so
interested
because
you
would
think
that
that
single
juror
out
of
the
12
would
be
able
to
unduly
influence
the
other
11?
justice
white
and
if
this
one
person
wasn't
so
hide
bound,
he
might
be
the
person
to
vote
against
it.
justice
white
you
just--
justice
white
--what?
justice
white
certainly...
by
the
way,
illinois
bifurcates
the
penalty
hearing.
justice
white
first
into
finding
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
and
his
age?
justice
white
yes.
and
then
the
second
phase
is
whether
or
not--
justice
white
--well,
that
phase,
though,
is
for
deciding
whether
he
will
get
the
death
penalty.
justice
white
and
there
the
judge
specifically
instructs
him
that
they
have
a
duty
of
following
every
instruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
case
is
morgan
against
illinois,
no.91-5118.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
reversed
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas.
