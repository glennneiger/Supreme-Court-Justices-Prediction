mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether,
in
a
capital
case,
a
defendant's
right
to
an
impartial
jury
requires
a
trial
court
to
inquire
of
potential
jurors
whether,
if
the
defendant
is
convicted
of
murder,
they
would
automatically
impose
a
sentence
of
death
at
a
subsequent
sentencing
hearing.
the
issue
in
this
case
arose
at
mr.
morgan's
trial.
the
defendant
asked
the
trial
court
to
ask
the
jurors,
would
you
impose...
if
you
convict
derrick
morgan
of
murder,
would
you
impose
a
sentence
of
death
no
matter
what
the
facts
are.
the
trial
court
declined,
giving
an
explanation
that
he
had
asked
that
question
in
substantially
similar
form
at
some
earlier
time,
but
he
had
not.
at
the
state's
request,
the
trial
court
did
ask
the
potential
jurors
whether
they
could
never
impose
the
death
penalty
upon
mr.
morgan.
following
those
questions,
approximately
17
jurors
were
excused
because
they
could
not
sentence
mr.
morgan
to
death,
or
they
said
they
could
not.
mr.
morgan
was
convicted
by
the
jury
of
murder,
and
he
was
subsequently
sentenced
to
death
by
that
jury.
the
illinois
supreme
court
affirmed
both
the
conviction
and
the
death
sentence.
on
this
issue,
it
ruled
that
there
was
no
requirement
to
reverse
witherspoon
in
the
jury,
in
other
words,
to
ask
whether
the
jurors
would
always
impose
death.
it
also
held
that
because
mr.
morgan
could
not
demonstrate
that
any
of
the
jurors
were
prejudiced
against
him,
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
any
relief.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
decision.
now,
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
a
defendant
an
impartial
sentencing
hearing
in
a
death
penalty
proceeding.
automatic
death
penalty
jurors,
people
who
would
automatically
impose
death,
cannot
serve
because
they
cannot
be
impartial.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
that
question
did
not...
the
form
of
the
question
did
not
discuss
the
illinois
statute.
it
did
not
discuss
weighing--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--actually,
it
definitely
does
mean
would
you
disobey
the
instructions.
that
is
all
that
the
defense
was
trying
to
find,
was
to
discover
whether
jurors
were
being
seated
who
could
not
follow
the
law.
and
indeed,
that
is
the
only
thing
that
they
wanted.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
discretion.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
the
question
was
not
narrowed
as
to
whether
they
could
weigh
aggravation
or
mitigation.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
it
wasn't.
it
was
even
narrower
than
any
of
that.
it
was
whether
you
would
always
impose
death,
no
matter
what
type
of
sentencing
procedure
had
been
followed.
it
was
not
even
as
broad
as
probably
would
have
been
allowed
by
decisions
subsequent.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
he's
not
going
to
say
that
he
would
not
obey
the
instructions.
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
pressure.
and
for
that
reason,
these
general
questions
about
whether
or
not
you
would
obey
the
law,
or
whether
you
can
be
fair,
are
not
adequate
to
reveal
whether
somebody
would
automatically
impose
the
death
penalty.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
you're
right.
it
does
not
require
them
to
disobey
the
law.
they're
told
in
illinois
that
the
death
penalty
will
be
imposed
unless
mitigation
outweighs
aggravation.
well,
to
jurors
such
as
these,
the
mitigation
will
never
outweigh
the
aggravation.
they
believe
that
death
should
automatically
be
imposed,
so
therefore
they
will
never
find
enough
mitigation
to
preclude
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
instructions,
because
that
is
precisely
what
they
are
told,
that
they
have
that
discretion,
and
it
is
pure
weighing.
and
there
is
no...
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
said
that
there
is
no
burden
of
proof
upon
the
state,
so
they
can
do
whatever
they
want,
as
long
as
they
weigh
the
mitigation.
and
even
if--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--that
is
part
of
our
argument.
we
don't
demand
absolute
equality,
but
in
an
issue
of
this
importance,
where
the
state
is
allowed
to
exclude,
as
in
this
case,
perhaps
17
people,
we
do
think
that
fundamental
fairness
requires
that
we
should
be
able
to
discover
the
opposite
type
of
jurors,
those
jurors
who
would
always
impose
death.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
i
believe
that
even
if
the
state
does
not
witherspoon,
the
defendant's
interest
in
obtaining
an
impartial
jury
is
so
significant
that
he
should,
at
his
request,
be
entitled
to
have
the
judge
inquire
of
these
jurors
whether
they
would
automatically
impose
death.
if
for
some
reason
the
state
decides
that
they
do
not
care
whether
there
are
anti-death
penalty
people
on
the
jury,
their
decision
should
in
no
way
force
a
defendant
to
perhaps
be
tried
by
a
jury
composed
of
people
who
would
automatically
impose
death
upon
him.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
your
honor,
we
merely
want
a
question
that
would
reveal
whether
they
could,
you
know,
consider
the
mitigation
and
follow
what
the
constitution
requires,
and
not
be
automatic
death
penalty
jurors.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
well,
when
there
is
a
jury
in
the
penalty
phase
in
the
trial,
when
the
trier
of
fact
in
the
penalty
phase
has
to
be
impartial,
and--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--even
though
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
state
gives
you
the
right
to
a
jury,
that
the
jury
has
to
be
impartial,
as
required.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
well,
this
court
has
specifically
held
in
turner
v.
murray
that
the
sixth
amendment
applies.
there's
the
bollington
v.
missouri
case
that
says
that
a
death
penalty
sentencing
hearing
is
the
equivalent
of
a
trial,
and
i
would
say
that
certainly
supports
the
sixth
amendment
application
to
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
hurt
my
feelings
to
rely
on
the
equality
argument,
either.
i
would
just
like
some
relief
for
mr.
morgan.
now,
the
risk...
there's
a
great
risk
that
these
people
will
serve
if
this
inquiry
isn't
made.
now,
the
cases
of
ross
v.
oklahoma
and
mu'min
v.
virginia,
automatic
death
penalty
jurors
appeared
in
there.
there
are
a
large
number
of
state
cases
where
these
people
appear.
in
june
of
1991,
there
was
a
poll
that
said
76
percent
of
the
population
favor
the
death
penalty,
and
half
of
those
believed
in
the
concept
of
a
life
for
a
life.
so
there
are
definitely
people
out
there
who
will
do
this,
who
will
impose
death
automatically.
and
furthermore,
it
is
not,
as
the
state
perhaps
suggests,
merely
a
question
of
numbers,
it's
a
question
of
logical
consistency.
these
jurors
are
as
unfit
to
serve
as
a
juror
who
would
not
impose
the
death
penalty,
and
logically
we
should
be
entitled
to
inquire--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--the
judge
has
absolute
discretion.
he
can
allow
the
jurors
to
voir
dire...
the
attorneys
to
voir
dire
if
he
sees
fit.
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
allowed
absolutely
no
participation
other
than
to
request
questions.
so
the
trial
judge
can
preclude
any
inquiry.
and
in
this
case
the
attorneys
had
no
chance
to
ask--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
because
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
these
people
might
think
that
they're
weighing
mitigation
and
aggravation,
but
they're
not
weighing
it
in
any
meaningful
manner
as
is
contemplated
by
the
constitution.
what
they
do
is
they
believe
that
no
mitigation
can
outweigh
the
aggravation.
it
is
automatic.
any
weighing
would
be
pointless.
it
is
not
meaningful
as
the
constitution
contemplates.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
it
would
just
directly
ask
them.
they
would
know
what
was
required
of
them.
could
you...
they
wouldn't
even
have
to
know
what
was
required
of
them.
would
you
automatically
impose
death?
if
they
answered
yes,
they
would
be
removed
from
the
venire,
and
they
could
not
be
on
the
jury.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
well,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
death
penalty
can't
be
imposed
in
suitable
cases.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
that
would,
i
believe,
satisfy
me,
because
that
would
reveal
that
these
people
would
always
impose
a
death
penalty.
however,
that
question
is
not
the
reverse
of
the
witherspoon
question.
ideally,
what
would
be
asked
is
would
you
always
impose
it,
and
they
would
answer.
and
if
there
was
some
problem
with
the
type
of
answer
that
they
gave,
if
there
was
some
ambiguity,
then
the
trial
judge
would
continue
it
and
explore
it
more.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
what
the
case
law
has
said
is
that
weighing
has
to
be
meaningful.
now,
if
he's
automatically
going
to
impose
death,
his
weighing
is
not
meaningful,
and
he
is
not--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--well,
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
present
mitigation.
now,
to
effectuate
that
right,
he
has
to
be
able
to
present
it
to
jurors
who
will
pay
attention
to
it.
otherwise,
it's
an
absolutely
meaningless
right.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes,
because
you
cannot
follow
the
law
to--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--i'm
not
saying
that
these
are
bad
people,
or
anything
of
that
nature.
i'm
saying
they
are
not
fit
to
be
jurors.
it's
a
very
logical
position
in
its
own
way,
that
death
should
be
automatic
following
a
murder.
but
the
defendant's
right
to
present
this
mitigation
to
defend
his
life
is
meaningless
if
these
jurors
are
on
the
jury.
and
if
these
jurors
were
fit,
this
court
would
not
have
held
in
ross
v.
oklahoma
that
a
death
sentence
must
be
vacated
if
there's
even
one
juror
on
the
sentencing
jury.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
i
was
not.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no
death
murder
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
i
would
have
no
way
of
predicting.
i
mean,
certainly
couldn't
tell
from
this
record,
since
the
question
wasn't
asked.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
kind
of
question
that
isn't
necessarily...
shouldn't
be
based--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--i
honestly
couldn't
tell
you
how
large
a
group
of
people
there
are.
i
would
say
that
perhaps
as
the
death
penalty
becomes
increasingly
popular
that
they
would
become
more
common.
but
again,
the
defendant's
right
to
preserve
his
life
is
pretty
well
ruined
when
such
an
individual
serves
on
the
jury.
and
whether
there
are
a
lot
or
a
few,
the
question
is
whether
can...
will
some
of
them
possibly
be
seated?
and
they
definitely
will,
and
that
is
what
all
of
these
cases
show.
so
it's
not
necessarily
a
question
of
how
many
there
are,
or
are
there
as
many
as
would
not
impose
death.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes,
and
there
was
one
in
mu'min.
and
in
ross
it
was,
the
juror
said,
i
can
be
fair.
and
then
they
asked
him,
but
would
you
always
impose
death?
and
he
said,
oh,
yes,
i
would.
i
wouldn't
consider
a
lesser
sentence.
so
that
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
where
the
fairness
question,
or
the
following
the
instructions
wouldn't
apply,
because
they
don't
really
know
what
fairness
involves,
or
what
the
law
involves
in
the
future.
you
need
to
ask
this
question.
that
tells
them
what
the
law
is,
and
that
is
what
allows
them
to
make
an
honest
answer.
and
they
don't
find
themselves
on
the
jury.
now,
in
addition
to
the
number
of
people
who
actually
might
or
might
not
be
out
there,
there's
just
a
tremendous
amount
of
prejudice
resulting
from
a
people's
serving
on
this.
because
these
people
have
already
decided
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case.
it's
not
like
race
or
bias
against
beards
or
any
of
the
other
biases,
it
goes
to
the
ultimate
issue.
a
racist
might
acquit
somebody,
even
though
he
does
not
like
their
race.
he
might
do
it.
but
this
is
a
person...
it's
a
bias
of
an
entirely
different
type.
they
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
it.
they
will
never,
ever,
you
know--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--no,
because
he
can
consider
the
mitigation,
he
just
does
not
give
a
certain
type
that
much
weight.
perhaps
if
he
said,
absolutely,
i
would
refuse
to
consider
the
mitigation,
perhaps
he
should
be
excluded.
but
realistically,
you're
not
allowed
to
inquire
of
these
jurors
what
type...
about
the
type
of
mitigation
you
might
present.
we
just
want
to
know
whether--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--no.
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be,
because
this
goes
to
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
they
can
just
absolutely
follow
the
law.
it
is
the
ultimate
issue.
that
is
a
prejudice
against
a
certain
type
of
evidence.
it
is
not
outcome
determinative
of
itself.
he
could
consider
other
mitigation
and
not
impose
death,
or
he
can
consider
that
mitigation
and
give
it
very
little
weight.
this
just
goes
to
the
ultimate
issue.
it
is
just
like
the
witherspoon
juror.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no.
certainly
not
in
illinois,
where
it
requires
a
unanimous
jury.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes,
that's
absolutely
true,
and
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
statute.
but
it
is
not
true
that
that
somehow...
well,
first
the
state
argues
that
they
have
this
greater
interest
than
we
do
in
discovering
the
witherspoon
reasons
for
the
purpose
outlined
in
your
question,
but
their
interest
is
really
wholly
irrelevant.
if
our
interest
in
discovering
these
jurors
is
great
enough,
i'd
be
willing
to
concede
to
them
that
theirs
is
10
times
greater
than
ours.
but
as
long
as
ours
is
great
enough
to
require
the
inquiry
in
this
case,
their
interest
is
absolutely
irrelevant.
it's
just
not
logically
equated
to
this.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
undue
influence
at
all.
what
it
is,
is
the
structure
of
the
illinois
death
penalty
statute,
where
one
juror
can
preclude
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
so
the
way
it
works
is
you've
got
12
shots
at
saving
your
life.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
exactly.
and
the
more
people
you
have
on,
the
fewer
chances
you
have.
and
the
fact
that
each
juror
can
prevent
it
makes
each
individual
juror
a
very
crucial
person.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
i'm
not
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
any
number
of
jurors
or
anything.
i'm
saying
that
the
statute
should...
that
the
state's
point
about
the
statute,
that
their
interest
is
greater,
is
absolutely
incorrect,
because
the
statute
is
designed
to
make
the
death
penalty
difficult
to
impose,
and
that
each
of
these
jurors
should
not
be
able
to...
should
have
the
opportunity
to
preclude
it,
and
that
the
automatic
death
penalty
people
don't.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
well,
if
that
is
the
position
of
this
court,
the
next
cases
you're
going
to
see
is
what
about
with
three
of
these
people
on
the
jury?
what
about
with
six?
and
we'll
be
fine-tuning
that
for
a
long
time.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes,
exactly.
just
as
if
in
a
trial,
you
know,
no
one
would
ever
say
that
a
racist
was
entitled
to
sit
on
a
jury
for
guilt
merely
because
the
other
11
jurors
would
have
to
agree
with
him
to
convict.
it's
just
not
done.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes,
they
cannot
consider
mitigation.
it's
not
a
crime
per
se,
but
they
are
not
fit
to
be
jurors.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
well,
they
don't
meaningfully
consider
it.
they
just...
if
they
as
much
as
told
the
judge
before
they've
heard
it
that
they're
not
going
to
give
the
guy
any
consideration
about
it,
they're
not
going
to
consider
the
mitigation.
that's
about
as
much
as
i
can
really
say
on
that
subject.
it's
just
that
if
they're
announcing
in
voir
dire
that
it's
always
going
to
be
death,
there
is
no
consideration
that
follows
in
the
sentencing
hearing.
now,
given
the
fact
that
in
ross
v.
oklahoma
this
court
has
said
that
these
jurors
shouldn't
serve,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
perhaps
the
state's
greatest
interest
in
this
case
would
be
to
allow
this
inquiry
so
that
we
don't
have
to
keep
coming
back
in
collateral
proceedings
in
the
future
to
overturn
these
convictions.
because
if
we
don't
get
to
voir
dire
these
jurors
on
this
subject,
the
only
time
we
can
find
out
about
whether
they
would
automatically,
or
did
automatically,
impose
a
death
penalty
is
years
later
in
a
collateral
proceeding,
and
then
the
state's
going
to
be
in
the
posture
of
re-creating
these
trials
and
finding
their
witnesses.
and
it
seems
to
me
their
best
policy
is
to
agree
that
we
ought
to
have
this
inquiry
whenever
the
defendant
asks
for
it.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
you
go
and
interview
the
actual
jurors
and
you
ask
them,
were
you...
did
you
believe
that
you
would
automatically--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--this
is
after
the
trial.
you
can't,
like,
do
this
on
direct
appeal.
you
have
to
wait
for
the
collateral
proceedings
and
go
out,
and
you
interview
all
of
the
witnesses,
and
you
interview
the
trial
attorneys
and
the
jurors.
it's
done
all
the
time.
and
it's
so
far
perfectly
permissible
to
interview
the
jurors.
now,
as
far
as
the
other
inquiry--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--you
could
call
the
juror
themselves
after
they've
talked
to
you.
now,
as
far
as
a
few
more
points
on
the
state's
positions.
now,
they
argue
that,
you
know,
that
the
fairness
inquiry
is
adequate.
but
even
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
finally
realized,
after
mr.
morgan's
case,
that
direct
inquiry...
there
is
no
better
way
than
direct
inquiry
into
this.
and
they
have
backed
away
from
their
idea
that
these
fairness
questions
can
reveal
it
and
that
the
defendant
is
somehow
required
to
show
that
the
jurors
are
prejudiced,
even
though
he
was
never
entitled
to
ask
about
the
subject
matter.
and
as
far
as
the
instruction
about
following
the
law,
here
in
this
case,
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
he
didn't
even
ask
three
of
the
jurors
if
they
could
follow
the
law.
so
here,
at
a
minimum,
in
this
case,
the
following
the
law
was
not
adequate
because
they
were
not
even
asked.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no.
we
do
not
seek
that
right
at
all.
we
would
seek,
you
know,
wainwright
v.
witt,
or
witherspoon...
anything,
no
hypotheticals,
no
facts,
just
direct
inquiry
on
whether
they
could
follow
this
crucial
area
of
the
law.
would
your
belief
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed,
you
know,
interfere
with
your
performance
of
your
duties
as
a
juror?
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
the
death
penalty.
if
you
convict
derrick
morgan
of
murder,
would
you
automatically
impose
a
death
sentence
in
this
case?
that
would
be
fine.
i
think
that
that
would
cover
it.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
i
think
that
that
is
a
juror
who
can
consider
mitigation
and
who
is
not
an
automatic
death
penalty
juror.
and
if
there
was
some
doubt
in
the
trial
court's
mind,
then
he
could
inquire
further.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
not
in
illinois,
because
the
trial
judge
has
complete
discretion,
and
if
he
thinks
that
the
trial
counsel
is
doing
something
that
he
shouldn't
be
doing,
then
he
would
tell
counsel
to
stop.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
yes.
if
you
convicted
mr.
morgan
of
murder,
would
you
automatically
impose
death?
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
state
that
because
of
the
importance
of
this
issue
to
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
sentencing
hearing,
and
because
the
questions
were
not
asked
in
this
case,
that
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
and
if
there
were
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
very
briefly,
in
response
to
the
question
about
whether
the
state
has
a
right
to
inquire
of
these
people
whether
they
could
indeed
impose
a
death
penalty,
in
lockhart
v.
mccree,
this
court
said
that
if
these
jurors
could
not
make
a
guilt/innocence
decision
because
of
their
feelings
on
the
death
penalty,
ipso
facto
the
state
is
entitled
to
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
automatically
against
the
death
penalty.
and
that's
all
we're
saying
here.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
it
conceivably
could
have
been,
but
it
is
very
persuasive,
it
makes
sense.
we're
not
here
to
quibble
with
the
state's
right
to
exclude
these
jurors
who
can't
follow
the
law.
and
it
fits
with
our
position
that
indeed
if
they
can't
follow
the
law,
they
shouldn't
be
on
the
jury.
now,
the
state
also
talked
about
the
mechanisms
were
in
place--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--not
according
to
the
state,
no.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no,
this
court
has
said
that--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--i
would
not
think
so,
no.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
no.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
that
is
only
part
of
the
witherspoon
decision.
but
what
is
important
is
that
when
they
can't
deliberate
on
any
phase,
you
ipso
facto
get
to
ask
the
question
to
reveal
that.
in
any
event,
it
is
that
you
get
to
ask
the
question,
not
what
phase
it
is.
in
this
case,
talking
about
the
mechanism
in
this
case,
one
of
the
jurors
said,
equivocally,
according
to
the
state,
look,
i'd
always
impose
a
death
penalty.
well,
with
the
mechanism
that
was
in
place
in
this
trial,
there
was
no
further
inquiry.
the
trial
judge
didn't
ask
him
what
you
mean,
sir,
or
anything
like
that.
under
the
trial
court's
discretion
there
was
absolutely
no
further
inquiry,
where
at
least...
because
he
didn't
have
to.
if
he
didn't--
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
--no.
we
would
limit
it
to
a
case
like
this
where
it
just
determines
the
ultimate
issue
before
the
court,
where
they
would
give
them
the
death
penalty.
this
is
the
ultimate
issue.
that
makes
it
different
from
race,
beards,
anything
else.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
even
with
bias
and
partiality,
that's
almost
always
covered
in
any
event.
mr.
allen
h.
andrews,
iii
it
could
be
constitutional
error.
that
might
go
back
to
the
special
circumstances
that
might
be
required
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
some
need
for
the
inquiry.
but
here,
where
it
goes
to
the
ultimate
issue,
that
is
the
special
need.
that
is
why
we
need
the
inquiry
with
this
specific
type
of
bias.
no
further
questions?
thank
you.
