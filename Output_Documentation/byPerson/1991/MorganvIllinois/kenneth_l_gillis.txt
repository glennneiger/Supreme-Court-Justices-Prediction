mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
asks
for
a
per
se
rule
here,
which
would
require
all
state
trial
judges
in
capital
cases
to
ask
a
particular
form
of
questions
to
prospective
jurors.
except
for
the
racial
prejudice
cases,
turner
v.
murray,
capital
cases,
this
court
has
never
required
that
of
state
trial
judges.
the
area
about
the
thoughts
about
the
death
penalty
was
adequately
opened
by
the
trial
judge
here.
one
juror,
benjamin
dexter's,
views
were
extreme,
and
he
was
excused
from
the
jury.
the
trial
judge's
questions
adequately
explored
that
area.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
well,
he
related,
too,
that
a
friend's
parents
had
been
murdered,
and
he
speaks
somewhat
inaccurately,
but
i
would
say
a
fair
reading
of
that
is
that
he
would
either
put
that
person
to
death
or
perhaps
he
was
referring
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes,
i
do.
though
i
think
that
we
must
look
realistically
at
the
whole
situation
of
a
trial.
the
jurors
don't
know
much
about
the
case
at
this
point,
just
the
charges
and
some
of
the
names,
the
victim's
name
and
the
defendant's
name.
it's
only
after
they
get
the
complete
set
of
instructions
later
on
in
the
trial
that
they
would
have
their
attention
focused
on
the
narrow
issue
of
aggravation
and
mitigation
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
no,
i
don't
believe
it's
a
constitutional
issue.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
in
ross
v.
oklahoma,
that
juror
did
not
sit,
but
a
peremptory
challenge
was
used.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
well,
i
think
that
in
ross
the
question
was
the
whole
make-up
of
the
jury,
whether
the
jury
was
impartial,
a
kind
of
a
factual
inquiry
about
the
impartiality
of
that
juror.
take...
darrell
huling
in
that
case
did
not
sit,
but
as
i
recall,
a
peremptory
had
to
be
used
and
the
court
held
that
that
upset
the
fairness
of
the
mechanism
in
so
far
as
the
jury
selection.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
it
may
not
be
a
constitutional
violation,
but
i
think
a
judge
using
his
discretion
could
apply
the
witt
standard
and
say
that
this
person
was
impaired
on
that
issue,
that
he
may
not
be
able
to
set
aside
that
view,
and
he
may
not
be
able
to
follow
the
law.
i
think
it's
discretionary,
however.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
it
is
within
his
discretion
to
rule
whether
this
person
is
so
impaired
that
the
person
could
not
consider
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
a
leaning
is
not
necessarily
enough,
but--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i
think
if
the
juror,
before
hearing
the
evidence,
is
locked
into
one
point
of
view
and
cannot
give
up
that
point
of
view,
that
that
is
not
a
proper
juror.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
if
the
judge
makes
that
finding.
if
he
or
she
makes
that
finding,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
in
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
a
matter
that's
been
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
state
trial
judges,
and
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i'm
sorry.
i...
my
point
is
that
given
this
court's
jurisdiction,
and
given
that
this
is
a
state
court,
that
it
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judges,
and
not
constitutionally
mandated
through
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i...
the
form,
i
think
they
could
legitimately
ask
questions
about
attitudes
about
the
death
penalty
as
witt
and
witherspoon
have
talked
about.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
other
than
through
persuasion,
i
don't
think
the
state
can
require
it.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
that's
right.
other
than
the
opinions
of
this
court--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--that's
right.
it's
only
if
the
process
is
done,
as
in
witherspoon,
it
must
be
done
fairly.
witherspoon
restricted
the
state's
right
to
excuse,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
requires
this
to
be
done,
this
sort
of
questioning
to
be
done.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
no,
i
don't
think
so.
there
is
still--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--in
ross,
the
juror
admittedly
and
clearly
said,
i
am
always
for
the
death
penalty.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
we've
got
one
juror--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--we
have
a
mechanism
here.
the
trial
judge
opened
up
and
explored
the
area.
i
don't
think
there
has
to
be
a
particular
mechanism,
a
particular
form
of
words.
and
that,
the
court
has
never
ordered
that,
except
in
the
racial
prejudice
case
or
a
situation
like
hamm
v.
south
carolina,
where
there
were
special
circumstances.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
the
whole
trappings
of
a
trial
court,
the
solemnity
of
it,
the
judge
is
there,
the
voir
dire,
the
introductory
remarks,
and
the
juror's
oath
that
he
swears
to
follow
the
law
and
apply
the
law
to
the
facts,
and
then
the
instructions,
which,
in
this
case,
narrowed
the
discretion,
that
still
there
is
discretion,
but
it's
vastly
narrowed
from
the
situation.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
the
instruction
says
if
you
find
any
mitigating
factor
that
you
should
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
that's
on
joint
abstract,
page
123.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
no.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
123.
if
you
unanimously
find,
from
your
consideration
of
all
of
the
evidence...
now,
that's
the
no
mitigating
factor.
the
flip
side
of
it
is,
if
you
unanimously
find
from
your
consideration
of
all
of
the
evidence
that
there
are
no
mitigating
factors
sufficient
to
preclude
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
then
you
should
sign
the
verdict
requiring
the
sentence
of
death.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
well,
that's...
that
may
be
a
matter
that
comes
in
the
jury
deliberation
room
once
that
occurs.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
everything
about
the
process,
including
the
instructions,
directs
the
jurors
to
see
if
they
can
find
mitigation.
if
a
person
is
so
made
up
that
they
just
do
not
believe
in
this
facts...
in
this
case
that
there
amounts
to
mitigation,
then
i
think
the
juror's
within
their
right
to
vote
for
the
death
penalty.
but
you're
right,
that
nothing
in
particular
points
out...
nothing
in
voir
dire
points
out
these
decisions
which
will
come
later.
although
the
judge
did
a
thorough
job
of
explaining
that
first
there'd
be
a
finding
of
guilt,
innocence,
and
then
there'd
be
a
finding
of
eligibility,
and
then
there
would
be
a
finding
about
aggravation
and
mitigation.
so
the
jurors
knew,
and
one
of
the
juror's
answers
mirrored
the
fact
that
he
recognized
that
decisions
would
be
made
later
on
down
the
line,
of
which
they
did
not
know
the
facts
at
that
point.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
basic
core
of
fundamental
rights
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
that
situation
would
cry
out
for
relief.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
in
the
real
world,
we
wouldn't
be
able
to...
there's
nobody
that
stamps
this
person
automatically
for
death
penalty.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
my
answer
is
that
it's...
and
i
hope
i'm
not
quibbling...
that
it's
not
clear,
with
one
person,
whether
this
person
is
that
type
of
person
that
would
automatically--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--the
question
in
a
state
court
of
whether
that
violates
fundamental
fairness?
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
do.
i
would
not...
i
wouldn't
let
that
person
sit.
but
i
think
in
the
realistic
setup
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
that--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--well,
no,
i
think
in
that
case
we've
assumed
some
knowledge
about
the
facts,
which
raises
another
issue.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
that
the
inquiry
is
about
whether
they
could
keep
an
open
mind,
follow
the
instructions
that
the
judge
gives
them.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
that
juror
is
assuming
knowledge
about
the
facts
in
the
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
first,
it's
to
find
if
he's
eligible--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--there's
any
mitigating
factors.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes.
and
this
judge,
particularly
he
asked
nine
of
the
12
jurors
that
question.
one
other
one
said
he
would
answer
similarly
to
all
the
other
questions,
and
that
the
subject
of
following
the
law
was
mentioned
throughout
the
voir
dire
process
in
this
case,
which
had
three
venires
brought
to
the
courtroom.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
conviction
and
sentencing.
i
thank
you.
