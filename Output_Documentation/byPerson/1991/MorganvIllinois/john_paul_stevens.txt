justice
stevens
do
i
understand
you're
making
the
rather
extreme
argument
that
you're
entitled
to
have
all
12
jurors
unbiased?
justice
stevens
for
making
the
rather
extreme
argument
that
you
are
a
biased
juror
if
your
particular
view,
which
is
not
unlawful,
of
a
crime
is
that
this
crime
deserves
the
death
penalty,
and
i
will
listen
to
the
evidence
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
your
honor,
but
i
will
tell
you
now,
with
this
kind
of
a
crime,
i
will
always
find
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty.
is
there
anything
unlawful
about
that?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand.
how
do
you
find
out
in
collateral
proceedings?
justice
stevens
but
will
the
judge
allow
you
to
inquire
into
that?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
that
juror,
i
gather
he's
the
one
that
said
he
would
automatically
impose
the
death
penalty
if
there
were
a
conviction
of
first
degree
murder?
justice
stevens
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
supposing
the
juror,
it
comes
out
during
the
colloquy,
that
he
believed
in
the
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth,
and
that
if
there
were
ever
a
conviction
for
first
degree
murder,
he
thought
that
nothing
less
than
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed.
would
you
think
it
would
be
an
appropriate
challenge
for
cause
to
remove
that
juror?
justice
stevens
may
i
carry
my
question
one
step
further?
agreeing
that
it
would
be
appropriate
challenge
for
cause,
do
you
think
the
constitution
would
require
that
a
challenge
for
cause
be
granted
on
the
facts
i've
given
you?
justice
stevens
mr.
gillis,
can
i
give
you
just
one
other
hypothetical?
i
don't
mean
to
push
you
too
hard
on
this,
but
i'm
assuming
a
question
whether
the
juror
would
in
all
cases
vote
in
favor
of
the
death
penalty
in
all
cases
of
first
degree
murder
because
that
was
his
conviction.
and
after
the
defendant's
peremptory
challenges
have
been
exhausted,
say
the
interrogation
of
the
jurors
revealed
that
there
were
12
such
people
in
the
panel,
and
they
all
got
on
the
jury.
would
you
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
constitution?
justice
stevens
i
think
it
would,
too,
but
why
wouldn't
one
do
it,
then?
because
isn't
the
theory
of
it
that
the
12
are
not
completely
unbiased
if
they
have
that
fixed
view
on
penalty?
justice
stevens
no,
but
that
person
very
candidly
says...
and
there
are
such
people
out
there.
i
don't
think
anyone
denies
that
there
aren't
some
people
who
believe
very
sincerely
that
this
is
the
correct
punishment
for--
--but
i
think
when
they're
in
a
trial
and
they're
directed
by
the
judge
that
here
are
the
instructions,
read
the
instructions,
and
they
are
informed
to
follow
the
law,
and
follow
their
oath,
that
that
person's
individual
feelings
would
be
placed
in
a
very
secondary
position
to
the
solemn
instructions
of
the
law.
well,
i
take
it
your
answer
is
that
in
my
12-person
hypothetical,
that
would
violate
the
constitution,
but
a
one-person
hypothetical
would
not.
justice
stevens
but
i'm
assuming
in
my
hypothetical
that
the
question
is
sufficiently
unambiguous
that
you
find
that
it
is
that
kind
of
person,
that
the
person
just
is
the
opposite
of
the
witherspoon-kind
of
person.
some
people
are
conscientiously
opposed
to
the
death
penalty,
some
people
sincerely
believe
that
it's
the
correct
punishment
in
every
capital
case.
and
i'm
just
saying
if
you
find
one
such
person
by
a
proper
question,
do
you
think
the
constitution
permits
that
person
to
serve
on
the
jury?
justice
stevens
yes.
