the

case
and

finishing

and

been
decided
at
the
time
that
this
replevin
was
instituted?

and
you
think
that
they
don't
make
it
pretty
clear
that
a

is
necessary?
justice

o'connor
the
second
case
is
wyatt
versus
cole,
91-126.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
dispute
arose
after
the
respondents,
pursuant
to
a
mississippi
statute,
obtained
a
court
order
for
the
seizure
of
cattle
and
other
property
in
the
petitioner's
possession.
the
petitioner
then
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
seeking
injunctive
relief
and
damages
from
respondents
and
from
the
county
sheriff
and
the
deputies
involved
in
the
seizure.
the
district
court
struck
down
the
statute
itself
on
due
process
grounds,
dismissed
the
suit
against
the
government
officials
on
the
ground
that
they
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
and
held
that
the
private
respondents
were
also
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
from
suit
for
conduct
arising
prior
to
the
statute's
invalidation.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
court
of
appeals
over
whether
private
defendants
threatened
with
suit
and
liability
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983
are,
like
certain
government
officials,
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
from
suit
under
the
case
of
harlow
versus
fitzgerald
which
we
handed
down
in
1982.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
remand.
even
if
the
most
closely
analogous
tort
suits
available
at
common
law,
which
were
abuse
of
process
and
malicious
prosecution,
even
if
they
are
sufficient
to
entitle
the
respondents
to
a
good
faith
defense,
these
common
law
torts
do
not
justify
according
private
defendants
the
objectively
determined,
immediately
appealable
qualified
immunity
from
suit
that
is
accorded
to
certain
government
officials.
the
special
policy
concerns
militating
in
favor
of
qualified
immunity
for
government
officials
are
not
applicable
to
private
parties.
extending
qualified
immunity
to
private
parties
would
have
no
bearing
on
whether
public
officials
are
able
to
act
forcefully
and
decisively
in
their
jobs
or
on
whether
qualified
applicants
enter
public
service,
nor
would
the
public
interest
be
unduly
impaired
if
private
individuals
are
required
to
proceed
the
trial.
because
the
nexus
between
private
parties
and
the
historic
purposes
of
qualified
immunity
is
to
attenuate
it,
we
do
not
extend
the
immunity
doctrine
to
private
defendants.
