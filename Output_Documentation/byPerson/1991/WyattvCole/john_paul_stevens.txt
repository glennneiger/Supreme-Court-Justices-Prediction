justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
your
opponent
cited
a
case...
i'm
not
sure
i
caught
the
name
of
it...
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
563
southern
2nd
1387
i
don't
think
he
cited
in
his
brief.
are
you
familiar
with
the
case?
justice
stevens
i
didn't
see
it
cited
in
anybody's
brief.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
another
case
about
mississippi
authorities.
i
understood
your
opponent
to
tell
us
that
the
mississippi...
i
don't
know
which
mississippi
court...
had
held
its
own
statute
unconstitutional,
is
that
correct?
justice
stevens
you're
not--
justice
stevens
--where
is
that
cited
again?
justice
stevens
what
did
it
hold?
justice
stevens
that's
the
case
we
talked
about
earlier.
justice
stevens
i
see.
you
were
not
counsel
when
the
brief
in
opposition
was
filed,
i
understand.
