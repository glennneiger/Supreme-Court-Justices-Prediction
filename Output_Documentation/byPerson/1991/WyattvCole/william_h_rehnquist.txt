chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
91-126,
howard
wyatt
v.
bill
cole
and
john
robbins.
mr.
waide.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
good
faith
and
innocence
claim
goes
to
their
knowledge
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
not
to
the
disposition
of
the
cattle.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
then,
mr.
waide,
that
the
outcome
here
should
depend
on
what
the
policy
is
in
each
of
the
50
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
is
the
answer
to
the
question
that
i
asked
you
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
you
say
the
policy
of
all
50
states
is
to
allow
an
action
against
someone
who
wrongfully
brings
a
replevin
action
without
any
requirement
of
malice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
that
leaves
the
whole
question
up
in
the
air.
what
does
the
word
wrongfully
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
you
don't
answer
the
question
of
whether
there
might
be
states
in
which
there
would
be
some
showing
of
malice
required,
if
you're
talking
about
just
state
causes
of
action.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
waide,
just
a
minute.
you've
said...
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
if
a
replevin
action
is
wrongfully
brought
the
plaintiff
is
liable
for
damages.
has
the
mississippi
supreme
court
defined
what
it
means
by
wrongfully?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
just
a
minute--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i
didn't
ask
you
what
the
situation
was,
i
asked
you
what
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
has
held
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
wrongful
replevin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
mcnamara,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
one
of
the
people
here
for
whom
you're
seeking
immunity
is
a
lawyer,
i
gather,
and
that
person
would
certainly
have
law
training,
one
assumes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mental
suffering
of
the
cattle.
chief
justice
rehnquist
not
on
the
basis
that
the
replevin
statute
was
unconstitutional,
but
that
it
didn't
cover
that
particular
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcnamara.
the
case
is
submitted.
