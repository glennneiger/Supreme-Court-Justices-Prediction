justice
kennedy
what
about
cole?
what
should
be
the
standard
for
his
liability?
suppose
he...
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
the
law,
let's
assume
that.
does
he
have
a
good
faith
defense
under
your
view
of
what
the--
justice
kennedy
--well,
i
want
to
know
what
the
standard
is,
because
he
would
say
well,
my
attorney
told
me
there
was
a
statute
on
the
books.
i
thought
that
it
was
all
right.
suppose
he,
number
one
demonstrates
his
subjective
good
faith...
he
acted
in
good
faith.
he
thought
that
he
had
a
right
to
do
what
he
did,
what
result?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
the
jury
entitled
to
an
instruction
under
1983
that
subjective
good
faith
is
a
defense?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
seemed
to
me
that
earlier
you
conceded,
and
i
think
perhaps
that
there
may
be
some
good
reasons
for
that,
that
there
should
be
a
subjective
good
faith
defense.
whether
you
call
it
a
defense
or
an
immunity
i
really
don't
care,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
may
be
sound
reasons
for
that.
do
you
concede
that
that's
a
prudent
course
for
the
law
to
take?
justice
kennedy
let's
assume
that
we
think
that's
before
us.
justice
kennedy
and
we
get
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
under
1983.
justice
kennedy
so
we
do
this
tort
by
tort.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
your
cause
of
action
is
under
1983.
justice
kennedy
that's
a
new
cause
of
action?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
when
he
fails
to
obey
a
ruling
of
the
district
court
that
was
made
in
this
1983
suit,
i
assume
you
say
that's
a
new
and
independent
violation
for
which
there
must
be
some
other
1983
action--
justice
kennedy
--or
was
this
just
a
contempt
of
court?
