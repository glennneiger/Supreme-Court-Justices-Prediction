mr.
jim
waide
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client,
howard
wyatt,
the
petitioner,
is
a
cattle
farmer
in
simpson
county,
mississippi.
he
had
a
cattle
partnership
with
the
respondent,
bill
cole.
in
july
of
1986
the
partners
weren't
getting
along
very
well--
mr.
jim
waide
--thank
you,
your
honor.
they
were
discussing
breaking
up
the
partnership.
now,
they
had
never
been
able
to
agree
on
what
the
terms
were
or
how
they
were
going
to
break
it
up,
and
they
had
further
discussions
scheduled.
the
day
before
they
were
to
meet
for
further
discussions
on
breaking
up
the
partnership,
my
client,
mr.
wyatt,
who
is
not
a
very
sophisticated
man
and
who
has
less
than
a
high
school
education,
comes
home
and
he
finds
out
at
the
farm
in
simpson
county...
he
finds
on
his
property
mr.
cole,
the
respondent,
his
attorney,
the
other
respondent
mr.
robbins,
and
a
bunch
of
deputy
sheriffs
and
other
people
going
about
the
process
of
taking
possession
of
partnership
property.
that's
what
he
finds
when
he
gets
there.
he's
never...
through
2
days
of
taking
over
the
property
they
never
serve
him
with
any
papers,
but
they
do
after
they've
taken
what
cole
contends
is
his
share
of
the
partnership
property.
as
it
turns
out
they
have
an
order
from
the
judge
that
says
take
23
head
of
cattle
and
other
personal
property,
and
they
take
possession
of
it.
now,
your
honor,
these
cattle
are
brahma
cattle,
which
probably
means
not
much
to
most
members
of
this
court,
but
it's
a
peculiar
type
of
cow,
and
that
is
that
a
brahma,
if
your
honors
have
ever
watched
a
rodeo,
once
these
cattle
have
ever
been
driven
with
horses
or
ever
been
chased
with
dogs
they
become
mean
and
unmanageable.
you
can't
keep
them
behind
a
fence,
and
after
that
their
value
is
diminished.
they're
worth
nothing
more
than
what
they're
worth
by
the
pound.
if
you're
gentle
with
the
cattle,
if
you
treat
them
right,
some
of
these
cattle...
one
of
the
cows
the
testimony
was
it
was
worth
$6,000,
a
registered,
gentle
animal,
but
after
this,
after
the
running
of
the
cattle
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
taken
over,
i
might
say
analogous,
justice
white,
to
some
football
players
that
you've
seen.
on
one
occasion
they're
gentle,
and
you
go
out
on
the
field
and
they
become
tough
and
ornery
and
that's
what
happened
to
these
cattle
by
raising--
mr.
jim
waide
--anyway,
your
honor,
brahma
cattle
are
probably
not
that
important
to
most
of
us,
even
though
mississippians
probably
have
more
appreciation
than
some
of
us
that
live
in
washington,
d.c.,
but
to
my
client,
mr.
wyatt,
these
animals
were
very
important
to
him.
they
were
important
to
his
family...
it's
what
he
done.
he
had
a
job
in
the
factory--
mr.
jim
waide
--no,
sir,
it
probably
doesn't,
except
that
the
defendants
are
claiming
good
faith
and
innocence
and
i
think
it
might
have
some
bearing
on
that,
that
they
would
have
known
what
they
were
going
to
do
to
him.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
end
result
of
it,
in
any
event,
was
that
a
hearing
was
finally
held.
the
mississippi
statute
provided
for
a
preseizure...
strike
that...
a
prehearing
seizure.
you
go
out
and
seize
somebody's
property
on
making
an
affidavit
and
then
you
have
a
hearing
later.
that
was
basically
the
scheme
of
the
statute,
and
of
course
mr.--
mr.
jim
waide
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
mississippi
statute
provided
or
allowed...
it
could
be
interpreted
to
provide...
the
mississippi
supreme
court
later
ruled
this
is
an
incorrect
interpretation,
but
it
could
be
read
to
say
that
you
can
go
seize
somebody's
property
and
then
have
the
hearing
later.
you
just
file
your
affidavit
with
the
judge
that
you're
entitled
to
the
property,
he
automatically
issues
the
order
to
go
pick
up
the
property,
and
then
you
have
the
hearing
later
after
posting
a
bond,
so
you
can
be
sued,
of
course,
if
you
were
wrong
in
making
the
seizure.
so
that's
basically
the
statutory
scheme,
and
that's
the
way
that
they
were
able
to
come
take
the
cattle,
and
after
having
them
a
few
days
mr.
cole
transported
them
to
texas,
even
though
a
state
judge
ruled
that
the
order
of
replevin
was
wrong
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jim
waide
that's
correct.
mr.
jim
waide
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
postseizure
hearing
the
circuit
judge
ruled
that
the
replevin
was
erroneously
issued
under
state
law,
that
this
dividing
up
a
partnership
is
not
within
the
replevin
statute.
you're
not
wrongfully
detaining
property
when
you
detain
it
as
a
partnership.
mr.
jim
waide
he
ordered
him...
i
might
point
this
out,
your
honor.
he
ordered
him
to
bring
the
cattle
back
or
pay
damages,
but
at
this
point,
of
course,
if
he
brought
the
cattle
back
that
wouldn't
remedy
the
wrong,
because
the
damages
was
caused
in
large
part
by
chasing
them.
mr.
jim
waide
let
me
finish
my
answer,
if
i
might...
and
also,
your
honor,
my
client,
who's
never
had
any
history
of
psychiatric
problems,
suffered
a
mental
breakdown
and
was
hospitalized,
and
the
remedy
of
bringing
the
cattle
back
which
a
state
judge
ordered
wouldn't
have
cured
that.
but
in
any
event,
he
didn't
follow
the
judge's
order.
he'd
taken
advantage
of
the
replevin
statute
as
far
as
he
wanted
to
use
it,
and
mr.
cole
just
did
not
follow
the
order
of
the
state
judge.
cole
claimed
his
lawyer,
robbins,
never
told
him
about
it.
robbins
said
he
told
him
about
it
and
he
doesn't
know
why
he
didn't
follow
it.
but
anyway,
he
didn't
follow
the
order
of
the
state
judge.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
we
decided
for
strategic
reasons
and
because
we
believed,
erroneously
as
it
turned
out,
we'd
be
better
off
in
the
united
states
district
court,
we
took
a
nonsuit
of
our
pending
proceeding.
the
state
judge
had
said
he
owed
us
damages,
but
we
didn't
know
how
much
damages
or
how
the
state
law
was
going
to
be
interpreted,
and
we
took
a
voluntary
nonsuit
of
the
state
replevin
action
and
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court,
so
that's
how
this
case
got
started.
now,
your
honor,
even
though
42...
and
i
feel
like
i'm
right
in
saying
this...
even
though
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
says
in
the
broadest
of
terms
that
everybody,
every
person
who
violates
another's
constitutional
rights
under
color
of
law
is
subject
to
damages,
even
though
the
statute
says
that,
under
well-settled
principles
that
this
court
has
announced
in
many
decisions,
the
district
judge
held
that
just
about
everybody
involved
was
clearly
immune
from
suit...
everybody.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir,
and
very
little
question
about
it,
most
of
it
we
abandoned
in
the
district
court.
we
sued
everybody,
but
most
of
it
we
abandoned
because
we
thought
this
court's
decisions
didn't
leave
us
any
room.
mr.
jim
waide
in
this
case
they're
claiming
qualified
immunity
for
a
private
defendant.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir.
the
state
was
immune,
of
course,
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
of
course,
everybody
knows
the
judge
was
immune,
and
of
course
we
didn't
sue
the
judge.
everybody
knows
that
he
was
immune
from
making
a
judicial
decision.
there
are
compelling
reasons
why
the
law
officers
were
immune.
the
judge
told
them
to
go
out
there
and
seize
the
cattle,
and
they
couldn't
be
put
in
the
position
very
well
of
violating
the
court's
order
of
being
held
in
contempt,
but
in
addition
to
that
we
had
the
qualified
immunity,
which
we
think
is
very
tough
to
overcome,
but
those
immunities.
so
we
just...
even
though
the
statute
says,
here
you
are,
you're
got
a
remedy,
under
the
immunity
doctrines
as
they
developed
we
didn't
have
any
remedy
because...
and
the
reason
we're
here
today,
and
the
only
person
that
was
involved
that
was
not
subject
to
decisions
of
this
court,
and
we
don't
believe
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
followed
in
this
case,
was
cole
and
his
attorney,
robbins.
that
is
the
private
party
immunity,
immunity
of
private
parties
who
violate
constitutional
rights,
and
that's
the
question
that's
before
the
court
today.
justice
o'connor
in
forrester
v.
white
sounded
a
familiar
theme
for
this
court,
a
theme
that
is
said
over
and
over
again
in
these
immunity
cases,
when
your
honor
said
we
don't
extend
immunity
beyond
what
its
policy
considerations
are.
in
applying
immunity,
we
look
to
the
policies
that
the
immunity
was
created
for.
that
was
said
directly
in
forrester
v.
white
and
is
a
theme,
i
think,
in
this
court's
qualified
immunity
cases.
now,
your
honor,
the
policies
that
this
court
has
announced
in
qualified
immunity
cases
are
very
clear
and
are
just
about
the
opposite
of
any
policies
that
might
be
involved
in
this
case.
for
example,
this
court
has
said
and
said
over
and
again
probably
beginning
with
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
but
over
and
over
again,
we
want
to
attract
citizens
to
public
office.
we
don't
want
to
make
it
undesirable
for
a
citizen...
unnecessarily
desirable
for
a
citizen
to
hold
public
office.
we're
not
involved
in
that.
mr.
robbins
and
mr.
cole
are
not
candidates
for
public
office.
they're
just
the
opposite.
they're
private
people.
and
then,
your
honors,
probably
the
strongest
case
for
immunity
is
the
law
enforcement
officer,
the
fellow
that's
out
there
and
he's
trying
to
decide
whether
to
make
an
arrest.
if
he
makes
the
arrest,
this
court
has
said
we
don't
want
to
hold
him
liable
for
exercising
his
judgment
and
trying
to
save
society
from
some
criminal
act
in
making
the
arrest.
we
don't
want
to
put
a
burden
on
that
discretionary
decision.
we
want
him
to
be
able
to
make
that
decision
on
whether
somebody
committed
a
crime
and
whether
they
ought
to
be
arrested
based
on
exercising
his
discretion
in
carrying
out
a
public
function.
of
course,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
and
then,
your
honor,
probably
the
strongest
thing,
or
the
thing
that's
so
applicable
to
public
officials
and
so
inapplicable
to
a
private
party,
when
you
look
at
mitchell
v.
forsyth
this
court
made
it
very
clear
that
it's
not
just
an
immunity
from
damages,
it's
an
immunity
from
suit.
the
official
is
not
supposed
to
take
his
mind
off
of
his
important
public
duties,
take
his
time
away
from
them,
by
having
to
defend
the
suit,
and
so
not
only
it
is
a
freedom
from
damages,
but
it's
a
freedom
from
suit
so
he
can
take
an
immediate
appeal.
now,
to
put
these
people
in
that
position
and
say
we
don't
want
to
take
their
minds
off
of
public
duties
and
they
can
take
an
immediate
appeal
is
just
totally
inconsistent
with
the
policies
of
mitchell
v.
forsyth.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
first,
it's...
i
think
it's
probably
not
quite
accurate
to
characterize
that
as
an
immunity.
i
consider...
it's
more
accurate
to
characterize
that
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
suit.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
have
probable
cause
or
malice,
there
might
be
some
defenses
to
the
suit
that
could
be
raised.
mr.
jim
waide
all
right,
sir.
mr.
jim
waide
all
right,
sir.
anyway,
it
was
a
matter
that
would
be
taken
up
at
trial.
it's
a
matter
that
would
be
taken
up
at
trial,
it's
not
a
defense
from
suit.
an
immunity,
as
this
court
has
construed
it,
is
a
defense
from
even
having
to
undergo
a
trial.
mr.
jim
waide
well,
your
honor,
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
argue
with
the
court.
i
thought...
my
interpretation
of
it
was,
it
was
an
affirmative
defense,
but
in
any
event
of
course
there
was
no
summary
judgment
procedure.
when
i
looked
at
the
precedents
the
conclusion
that
i
drew
from
it
was,
it
was
a
matter
that
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury
at
trial,
the
issue
of
malice,
an
affirmative...
well,
where
there's
an
affirmative
defense
and
not
a
matter
for
the
factfinder.
and
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
quarrel...
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
quarrel...
the
mississippi
supreme
court
i
think
took
the
correct
view
of
this
matter
in
a
case
that
the
respondent
cited,
and
they
said
there
might
be
some
defenses
you
could
raise
at
trial.
you
might
be
able
to
show...
it
might
be
mr.
cole
would
come
up
at
trial
and
say
well,
i
thought
the
statute
was
legal
on
its...
if
the
court
wanted
to
adopt
a
subjective
good
faith
standard,
i
don't
find
that
nearly
so
objectable
as
saying
you
can't
even
get
to
first
base,
this
is
an
immunity
from
suit.
mr.
jim
waide
justice
white,
ironically
we
should
have,
because...
and
i
think
this
is
an
another
important
facet
about
this
case...
if
this
court
is
going
to
adopt
a
policy,
and
that's
what
it
has
to
do,
your
honor;
justice
white
in
the
burns
case
very
recently
said
this
court
has
no
authority
to
just
judicially
create
policies,
and
justice
scalia,
that's
why,
of
course,
the
court
looks
to
the
common
law
background.
but
in
this
case,
if
this
court
adopts
a
policy,
if
this
court
says
we're
going
to
have
a
policy
that
private
defendants
can't
be
sued,
i
think
it's
important
to
think
about
what
policy
interest
is
it
that
we're
implementing,
and
to
me
that
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
the
policy
of
the
state
of
mississippi
to
protect...
to
allow
its
citizens
to
rely
on
statutes.
that
would
be
the
policy
that
the
court
would
be
looking
at,
that
particular
policy,
and
i
think
that
42
u.s.c.
1988
counsels
this
court
to
look
at
what
state
policies
are.
now,
the
state
of
mississippi,
your
honor,
on
the
comment
that
we
should
have
stayed
in
state
court,
in
retrospect
we
certainly
should
have
because
the
case
that
counsel
cited
consistent
with
his
ethical
duty
to
cite
cases
contrary
to
his
position,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
in
the
foremost
case
that
he
cited
that
they
don't
see...
in
effect
they
don't
see
any
mississippi
policy
prohibiting
a
suit
against
a
person
that
wrongfully
implements...
wrongfully
brings
a
replevin
action.
that's
the
policy
that
mississippi
announced.
now,
the
thing
that
i
don't
understand
on
it--
mr.
jim
waide
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
the
only
point
that...
i
might
say
it
wouldn't
differ
in
this
case,
because
all
the
states
have
similar
policies,
but
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
second.
but
the
only
thing
that
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
if
we're
talking
about
a
policy
decision...
we're
talking
about
a
policy.
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
is
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
going
to
create
an
immunity?
i'm
saying
that
if
the
court
does
that,
the
policy
that
it
would
have
to
be
implementing
or
trying
to
carry
out
is
an
interest
the
state
of
mississippi
has.
that
would
be
the
policy.
now,
your
honor,
i
understand
the
danger
that
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice
is
talking
about,
that
you'd
have
a
different
rule
of
immunity
from
state
to
state.
i
might
say,
your
honor,
that
in
robertson
v.
wagaman
this
court
addressed
that
and
said
42
u.s.c.
1988
counsels,
or
means
there's
bound
to
be
some
differences.
of
course,
we
have
different
statutes
of
limitations
because
we
look
to
state
law.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
my
answer
to
this
question
is
it
would
be
uniform
across
the
states.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
in
dora
v.
connecticut...
this
is
the
most
recent
replevin
case
that's
decided...
there's
an
appendix
to
that
opinion
that
outlaws
the
replevin
laws
across
the
state,
and
it's
practically
uniform,
if
not
a
uniform
requirement,
that
when
somebody
brings
a
replevin
action
he
posts
a
bond.
in
other
words,
all
the
states
contemplate
that
the
private
person
wrongfully
bringing
a
replevin
action
can
be
sued.
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
it
wouldn't
make
for
any
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
your...
well,
your
honor,
the
statutes,
i
think
the
language
of
the
statutes
just
simply
says
if
you
wrongly
sue
out
a
writ
of
replevin
you
can
be
sued.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir,
i
understand.
the
only
point
that
i'm
making,
your
honor...
that
is
correct,
but
the
only
point
that
i'm
making
is
the
states,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
do
not
have
a
policy
that
people
who
bring
replevin
actions
are
immune
from
suit.
mr.
jim
waide
all
right.
well,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place
i
would
assume,
at
least
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
in
any
type
of
suit
as
a
factual
matter,
any
type
of
suit
that's
based
on
some
type
of
abuse
of
process
or
malicious
prosecution
theory,
which
is
what
this
essentially
is,
that
type
of
suit
there
are
certain
factual
matters
that
the
jury
could
take
into
account,
and
i
think
one
of
those
might
be
whether
this
person
acted
intentionally
or
something,
but
that
doesn't...
the
qualified
immunity
is
an
objective
standard.
it's
an
immunity
from
suit,
and
that's
what...
all
i'm
asking
this
court--
mr.
jim
waide
--excuse
me,
your
honor,
but
i
would
differ
with
the
court
just
in
this
respect.
the
qualified
immunity,
as
this
court
has
announced
it,
is
a
legal
standard
of
objective
rulings.
although
the
term
bad
faith
is
used,
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
bad
faith.
it's
a
question
of
whether
they
acted
contrary
to
law,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
there
are
certain
matters
the
court...
i'm
asking
this
court
to
rule
there
is
no
qualified
immunity...
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
applied
it
to
public
officials,
there
is
no
qualified
immunity.
it's
not
necessary,
your
honor,
for
this
court
to
even
reach
the
question
of
what
kind
of
matters
might
be
admissible
into
evidence
at
trial,
and
i'm
simply
suggesting
to
the
court
that
when
we
go
to
trial
we
will
probably
call
some
lawyers
and
they
would
say,
well
it
was
at
least
known
everywhere
that
there's
some
question
about
whether
this
is
constitutional
or
not.
you'd
at
least
know
there
was
a
question
about
it.
i
mean,
maybe
you
don't
meet...
maybe
it's
still
qualified
immunity,
but
everybody
ought
to
know
there's
some
question
about
this
type
of
procedure.
and
mr.
cole
will
get
on
the
stand
and
he'll
say
well,
i
thought
the
statute
was
valid,
and
we'll
ask
mr.
robbins
well,
didn't
you
tell
him
there
was
at
least
a
question
about
it?
didn't
you
tell
him
there
was
at
least
a
question
that
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
these
things
are
of
questionable
legality,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
your
honor,
in
its
opinion
appeared
shocked
that
anybody
would
do
anything
like
this
and
said
that
its
understanding
of
the
statute
was
that
there
had
to
be
some
emergency
reason
to
go
out
and
seize
property
before
a
hearing.
that's...
you
can't
get
that
from
the
statute.
but
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
if
anybody
is
going
to
have
a
policy
against
not
suing
or
allowing
reliance
on
the
state
statute,
it
is
surely
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
i
might
say
the
attorney
general,
your
honor,
was
an
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
and
he
took
no
position
on
this
issue.
he
said,
i
concede
the
statute's
unconstitutional,
but
he
didn't
take
any
position
that
i
want
our
private
citizens
not
to
be
sued.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
my
opinion
of
how
the
court
should
decide
the
case
as
to
cole
is
that
first,
disagreeing
perhaps
with
justice
scalia,
that
there
is
no
common
law
background
sufficiently
close
to
this
to
justify
this
court
giving
any
immunity
at
all,
so
immunity,
which
is
a
legal
defense,
is
just
out.
qualified
immunity
is
out,
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
announce
exactly
what
defenses
maybe
cole
could
raise
down
in
the
courts,
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
do
that,
i
would
just
suggest
that
those
analogous
defenses
that
exist
in
the
common
law,
mr.
cole
ought
to
be
able
to
get
up
there
and
say,
i
think,
well
i
thought
the
statute
was
legal.
and
we
ask
him
on
cross-examination
well,
mr.
cole,
are
you
telling
me
that
you
think
you
can
go
out
and
seize
somebody's
property
before
any
trial,
not
knowing
whether
you're
going
to
win
the
trial?
mr.
jim
waide
all
right,
i
think
the
jury
in
that
case
would
probably
decide
in
mr.
cole's
favor
if
it
thinks
the
lawyer
never
told
him.
mr.
jim
waide
no,
sir,
that's...
no,
they're
not,
your
honor,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
it's--
mr.
jim
waide
--your
honor,
the
appropriate
course
in
this
case,
in
my
opinion,
is
to
decide
the
case
before
the
court,
which
is
that
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
as
this
court
has
announced
it
is
not
to
be
applied
to
private
defense.
now,
that's
the
end
of
that
discussion.
now,
the
second
question
is,
what
about
defenses
that
cole
could
raise,
such
as--
mr.
jim
waide
--all
right,
sir...
such
as,
i
didn't
think
i
was
doing
anything
wrong.
i
think
then
that
the
court
could
give
the
jury
an
instruction
that
the
plaintiff
must
prove
that
cole
acted
with
malice.
i
think
that
very
well
might
be
an
appropriate
instruction,
but
you
have
to
remember,
your
honor,
that
the
mississippi--
mr.
jim
waide
--your
honor,
the
state
law
standards
are
incorporated
into
1983,
as
i
understand
it,
by
1988
and
generally
in
a
malicious
prosecution
or
abuse
of
process
type
suit
that
is
an
element
of
the
case.
mr.
jim
waide
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
we
have
1988
indicates
to
some
extent
there's
going
to
be
variance
among
the
states,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
great
disparity.
i
think
any...
as
far
as
i
know,
any
state
that
talks
about
a
malicious
prosecution
or
an
abuse
of
process
type
of
situation
requires
malice.
mr.
jim
waide
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
when
1983
doesn't
provide
the
appropriate
rules
of
decision
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
it's
just
general
that
you
look
to
the
common
law
or
the
to
state
law,
and
we
think
that...
your
honor,
we
think
that
even
if
the
jury's
instructed
on
malice,
that
we
had
to
prove
that
as
an
element
of
the
case,
assuming
that
such
an
instruction
is
given,
we
think
that
we
had
evidence
that
we
could
have
proved
that
with,
but
the
trouble
was
the
district
judge
ruled
that
this
was
a
matter
of
law,
and
that's
consistent
with
your
honor's
decisions,
and
that
we
were
not
going
to
be
able
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury.
mr.
jim
waide
well,
your
honors
do
apply
state
law
and
have
frequently
applied
state
law
on
various
defenses
that
might
come
up
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations,
or
such
as
survivorship
rules.
that's
in
wilson
v.
garcia,
and
1988
contemplates
that
you'll
look
to
common
law
or
state
law
for
the
rules
of
decision
in
a
lot
of
cases,
and
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
doing
that
in
this
case,
and
i
also
see
no
inconsistency,
assuming
that's
a
bad
thing.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
your
honor,
wilson
v.
garcia
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
an
affirmative--
mr.
jim
waide
--well--
mr.
jim
waide
--well,
your
honor,
all
that
i
can
say
is
it's
always
my
assumption
in
trying
1983
cases,
and
it
appears
to
be
universally
done,
if
there's
no
rule,
there's
no
federal
rule...
you
know,
if
we're
talking
about
a
cause
of
action
and
there's
nothing
in
any
statute
that
says
what
the
elements
are
for
this
cause
of
action,
you've
got
to
look
somewhere
for
the
rule
of
law,
so
to
me
the
logical
place
to
look
and
dictate
it
by
1988
is
state
law
or
the
common
law.
that's
what
the
statute
directs
the
court
to
do,
and
of
course
as
in
erie
v.
tompkins
there's
no
general
federal
common
law,
so
that's
the
only
place
logically
that
you
could
look.
mr.
jim
waide
justice
white,
the
bondsman
was
attorney
robbins'
son
and
mr.
cole's
wife.
the
wife
was
in
texas
and
the
son
had
no
assets
that
we
could
find.
mr.
jim
waide
just
pay
any
damages
that
might
accrue
because
of
the
wrongful
suing
out
of
the
writ
of
replevin
was
the
condition
of
the
bond.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
had
the
bond
been
good,
mississippi
replevin
law...
we're
just
talking
about
state
law
now
for
wrongful
replevin...
had
very
limited
damages
rules,
which
was
part
of
the
reason
why
we
came
to
federal
court.
the
damages
were
the
loss
of
use
of
the
property
and
the
value
of
the
property,
and
there
hasn't
been
any
state
precedents
effected.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir,
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
waide
that's
an
interesting
point,
your
honor,
and
the
way
the
statute
is
written
it's
an
absolute
liability.
it's
like
playing
with
dynamite.
if
you
wrongfully
replevin
property,
you're
liable,
and
i
hope,
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia--
mr.
jim
waide
--yes.
now,
those
are
the...
justice...
i
said
to
justice--
mr.
jim
waide
--constitutional
tort.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
what
i
would
like--
mr.
jim
waide
--just
failing
to
comply
with
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
essentially
what
it
would
amount
to,
that
it
was
not
justified.
mr.
jim
waide
i
don't
know
that
that
language
is
there,
but
that's
the
situation.
there
are
two
situations--
mr.
jim
waide
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
jim
waide
all
right,
sir.
it's
held
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
a
replevin
that
the
court
ultimately
rules
was
not
justified
is
a
wrongful
replevin.
mr.
jim
waide
under
the
state
law.
it's
ruled
in
that
situation.
it's
ruled
in
a
second
situation.
it's
ruled
in
this
1983
type
situation.
those
are
the
two
situations
it's
addressed
on
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
jim
waide
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
your
honor...
this
is
the
case
that
i
was
referring
to.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
addressed
this
precise
issue
before
us
and
held
there
was
no
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
jim
waide
yes,
sir,
it
was.
it's
a
case
that's
cited.
i
might
give
the
court
the
cite.
mr.
jim
waide
in
that
case,
could
you
have
collected
on
the
bond?
i
would
assume
so.
that
wasn't
discussed
in
the
case.
mr.
jim
waide
all
right,
sir.
mr.
jim
waide
your
honor,
the
case
i
consider
to
be
all
fours
with
this
case.
it's
the
precise...
the
only
difference
in
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
we
did
have
a
ruling
by
a
state
judge
in
this
case
that
the
ruling
was
wrong...
that
the
replevin
was
wrongful
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
jim
waide
563
southern
2nd
1387.
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
