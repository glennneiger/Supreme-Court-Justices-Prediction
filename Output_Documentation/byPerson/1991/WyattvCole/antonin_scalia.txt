justice
scalia
mr.
waide,
that
may
be
true
with
respect
to
official
immunity,
but
we
adopted
official
immunity
for
1983
actions
because
it
was
in
existence
in
1870.
there
was
also
a
private
immunity
in
1870,
though,
for
people
bringing
legal
actions.
i
mean,
you
couldn't
sue
and
recover
for
false
arrest,
for
malicious
prosecution,
for
abuse
of
process,
without
showing
that
the
person
brought
that
legal
process
without
probable
cause,
which
meant
that
the
person
had
to
have
entertained
a
subjective
belief
that
he
was
not
justified
in
going
ahead.
now,
why
shouldn't
that
same
immunity...
not
official
immunity,
but
the
immunity
of
a
person
invoking
the
legal
process
which
existed
in
1870,
why
shouldn't
that
be
applied
to
1983?
justice
scalia
no,
it
was
not
a
defense.
the
plaintiff
had
to
show
it,
so
i
don't
care
whether
you
call
it
an
immunity
or
not--
justice
scalia
--but
it
would
have
been
your
burden
to
show
it.
justice
scalia
well,
no,
you
would
have
to
plead
it.
you
would
have
to
plead
that
subjectively
malicious
frame
of
mind,
or
you
wouldn't
even
get
past
the
summary
judgment
stage.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
waide,
i'm
not
sure
that...
i
think
it's
one
and
the
same
thing.
i
think
you
try
to
characterize
the
one
as
an
immunity
and
the
other
as
a
matter
of
evidence.
all
the
immunity
is
for
officers
is
that
you
have
no
cause
of
action...
if
it's
qualified
immunity,
you
have
no
cause
of
action
unless
you
prove
bad
faith,
and
it's
the
same
thing
here.
against
a
private
individual
you
have
no
cause
of
action
unless
you
prove
bad
faith.
now,
both
of
them
you
can
either
characterize
them
as
immunity,
or
you
can
characterize
them
as
what
must
be
proven
at
trial,
but
they
are
one
and
the
same
thing.
justice
scalia
why
would
we
apply
these
defenses
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
we
don't
apply
immunity...
official
immunity
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
we
simply
determined
that
when
this
federal
statute
was
passed
in
1870
there
was
such
a
thing.
we
changed
it
a
little
bit,
but
basically
there
existed
an
official
immunity,
so
we
apply
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
why
shouldn't
we
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
private
immunity
or
defenses
against
liability?
justice
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
case
where
we
look
to
state
law
for
defenses
to
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
statutes
of
limitations,
i'm
talking
about
substantive
defenses
to
the
cause
of
action.
justice
scalia
it
seems
very
strange
to
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
say
however,
what
defenses
exist
to
this
federal
cause
of
action
ought
to
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
it's
very
strange.
justice
scalia
mr.
mcnamara,
as
i
recollect,
one
reason
we
have
adopted
the
objective
standard
for
official
immunity,
which
i
as
recollect
was
not
the
common
law
approach,
was
that
officials
are
subject
to
suit
all
the
time.
they'll
spend
their
whole
lifetime
in
court
if
every
time
they
obey
their
orders
they
have
to
go
through
a
trial
to
show
subjective
good
faith.
now,
that
isn't
the
case
with
respect
to
private
individuals.
they're
not
going
to
be
drawn
into
this
thing
repeatedly.
why
do
they
need
that
same
kind
of
protection?
justice
scalia
well,
but
sure
there
is,
but
we
could
take
account
of
that
by
giving
a
good
faith
immunity...
subjective
good
faith
immunity,
not
just
the
objective
standard.
justice
scalia
mr.
mcnamara,
when
you
said
that
there
would
be
a
remedy
under
mississippi
law
for
the
suing
out
of
a
wrongful
attachment,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
suing
out
of
a
wrongful
attachment?
would
you
have
to
prove
knowing
that
it's
wrongful?
