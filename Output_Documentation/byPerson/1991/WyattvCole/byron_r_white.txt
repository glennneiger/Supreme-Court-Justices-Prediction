justice
white
to
say
the
least.
justice
white
yes,
but
when
you
run
them
enough
they
become
very
gentle.
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
does
that
really
bear
on
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
white
so
it's
not
a
preseizure
hearing,
it's
a
postseizure
hearing.
justice
white
well,
you
had
a
postseizure
hearing.
justice
white
what
happened
at
the
hearing?
justice
white
so
what
did
he
order?
justice
white
and
then
what
happened?
justice
white
and
then
what
happened?
justice
white
absolutely.
justice
white
was
this
absolute
immunity,
or
qualified?
justice
white
that's
what
the
district
judge
ruled.
justice
white
that's
what
you
should
have
taken
to
the
state
court.
justice
white
mr.
waide,
why
wasn't
the
bond
valid
in
this
case?
why
couldn't
you
collect
on
the
bond?
justice
white
what
was
the
condition
of
the
bond?
justice
white
so
if
the
bondsman
had
been
good
the
bondsman
could
recover
against
his
principal,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
anyway,
whatever
you
could
have
collected
on
the
bond,
the
bondsman
could
have
collected
from
his
principal.
justice
white
and
it
wouldn't...
and
the
principal
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
plead
any
kind
of
immunity
or
any
defense
against
that
kind
of
action.
justice
white
so
the
risk
of
an
illegal
replevin
is
on
the
person
who
replevies.
justice
white
and
that
goes
for,
you
think...
and
i
suppose
it
goes
for--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
under
the
state
law.
justice
white
where
the
replevin
statute
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
justice
white
well,
i...
well,
was
it
a
case
in
which
the
replevin
statute
was
held
unconstitutional?
justice
white
but
you
don't
know
whether
you
could
have
collected
under
the
bond
in
that
case.
justice
white
well,
you
don't...
let's
not
assume
it--
justice
white
--because
the
bond
may
just
be
conditioned
on
a
rightful
replevin
under
state
law,
and
not
on
the
possible
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
justice
white
what's
that
cite
for
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi?
justice
white
what
if
they
should?
justice
white
what
if,
objectively,
they
should
suspect
it?
justice
white
oh,
so
it's
an
objective
test
you're
talking
about?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
but
not
just
a
subjective
good
faith
test.
justice
white
okay.
go
ahead.
justice
white
do
you
think
this
defendant
who
is
a
lawyer
should
have
been
aware
of
any
decisions
in
this
court
that
might
raise
a
question
about
the
validity
of
the
replevin
statute
in
mississippi?
justice
white
how
about
the
damage
to
the
cattle,
if
there
was
some?
justice
white
yes,
what?
justice
white
even
brahmas.
