mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
analyzing
whether
to
extend
immunity
to
parties
who
come
before
it
as
section
1983
defendants,
this
court
has
engaged
in
a
dual
history
and
policy
analysis,
and
i
would
first
address
the
issue
of
what
is
the
compelling
public
policy
which
would
cause
this
court
to
formally
extend
immunity
to
those
persons
who
act
such
as
my
clients,
mr.
cole
and
mr.
robbins
did,
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
the
public
policy
that
is
foremost
is
that
the
courts
want
to
encourage
that
citizens
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
a
statute
which
has
not
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
which
they
do
not
suspect
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
if
they
should?
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
if
they
fail
to
meet
the
objective
standard...
in
other
words,
i
think--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--your
honor,
i
would
want
this
court
to
approve
the
objective
standard
which
was
applied
in
this
case--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--by
the
district
court
and
approved
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
but
i
would
also
state--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
there
are
reasons
why
the
objective
case,
and
that
contrary
to
what
the
general
argument
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
seems
to
be
that
the
extension
of
any
immunity...
and
this
is
said
in
his
brief...
the
extension
of
any
immunity
under
these
circumstances
is
going
to
make
it
practically
impossible
for
there
ever
to
be
a
recovery
against
private
party
defendants,
and
your
honor,
for
instance,
in
the
case
which
is
before
the
court,
mr.
cole
and
mr.
robbins
were
granted
the
extension
of
immunity
by
the
district
court,
approved
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
to
the
actions
which
were
taken
up
to
the
district
court
judge's
april
opinion
which
said
that
the
statute
in
question
is
unconstitutional.
then,
when
mr.
cole
kept
those
cattle
out
in
texas
he
was
subject
to
damages
in
this
situation,
or
at
least
to
have
the
question
brought
before
the
jury,
so
at
least
in
this
case
is
an
example
of
a
private
party
defendant
who
was
at
least
exposed
to
liability
before
a
jury
and
who
ultimately
by
the
fifth
circuit's
mandate
is
going
to
have
to
pay
some
attorney's
fees
for
the
conduct
which
he
engaged
in
after
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
by
the
district
court,
since
he
did
not
comply
with
the
order.
a
second
point
that
seems
to
be
made
by
mr.
wyatt's
counsel
is--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--no,
your
honor.
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
no,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
everything
which
came
to
it
from
the
district
court
except
that
it
remanded
for
a
finding
of
attorney's
fees
against
mr.
cole
for
the
reason
that
he
had
engaged
in
conduct
which
violated
the
statute
after
the
district
court
judge
had
declared
it
unconstitutional.
the
jury
had
found
no
damages
at
the
trial
below
because
for
the
main
reason
that
counsel
for
mr.
wyatt
conceded
that
there
were
no
damages
occurring
even
for
the
mental
anguish
which
he
alleges
his
client
to
have
suffered,
that
no
damages
occurred
after
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality,
that
all
of
the
damages
which
mr.
wyatt
was
claiming
he
said
occurred
before
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality,
and
mr.
waide
has
alluded
to
the
great
emotion
and
upset
that
he
experienced
because
of
the
taking
of
his
cattle.
now,
a
second
public
policy
reason
to
consider
is
that
if
the
court
does
not
grant
immunity
to
private
persons
who
acted
as
mr.
cole
and
mr.
robbins
did,
then
the
court
would
be
putting
the
burden
of
paying
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
mississippi
statute
on
the
persons
who
absolutely
have
the
minimal
involvement
in
this
case,
and
in
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
burns
v.
reed,
in
discussing
the
extension
of...
well,
actually
the
issue
was,
of
course,
whether
the
prosecutor
would
be
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
in
his
role
of
giving
the
advice
to
the
police.
in
his
majority
opinion
at...
i've
got
114
lawyer's
edition
2nd
564...
there
is
a
discussion
by
the
majority
there
as
to
why
should
we
extend
this
grant
of
absolute
immunity
to
the
prosecutor
in
his
role
of
advising
the
police
and
then
grant
only
the
limited
or
qualified
immunity
to
the
police.
so
this
court
has
previously
looked
at
who
has
the
most
involvement,
who
has
the
most
ability
to
determine
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
and
one
of
the
comments
that
the
court
makes
there
is
that
those
police
officers
are
certainly
not
going
to
have
the
law
training
that
prosecutors
have.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
in
the
majority
opinion
when
it's
discussing
the
objective
standard
which
would
be
applied,
that
this
court
says
that
we're
going
to
look
at
it
as
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
person
would
know
that
the
action
taken
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant,
and
further
on
in
that
opinion
it
clarifies...
the
opinion
is
clarified
where
the
court
says
we're
going
to
look
at
the
reasonable
government
official.
and
so
in
this
instance
in
the
application
of
the
objective
standard,
one
can
look
at
the
reasonable
attorney,
one
could
look
at
the
reasonable
person
who's
just
somewhat
casually
engaged
in
the
cattle
business,
or
one
could
look
at
whether
the
1983
defendant
was
citibank
who
may
be
bringing
replevin
actions
at
numbers
per
hour
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
obviously,
even
the
citibank
example
that
i
gave
is
not
going
to
have
the
potential
exposure
that
the
public
officer
would,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
an
important
public
policy
in
encouraging
people
such
as
mr.
cole
and
mr.
robbins
to
utilize
procedures
that
are
presumptively
valid
at
the
time
they
use
them.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
your
honor,
and
in
this
case,
that
the
issue
which
petitioner
raised
in
the
brief
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
extension
of
immunity,
and
the
petitioner
did
not
argue
some
alternative
to
the
objective
standard
of
immunity
which
was
applied
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
by
the
district
court,
and
we
would
say
under
these
circumstances,
since
there
happened
to
have
been
in
the
case
before
the
court
extensive
discovery,
this
is
not
a
situation
coming
before
the
court
where
there
were
simply
pleadings
and
where
my
clients
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
harlow
fitzgerald
immunity.
if
there
was
some
malicious
conduct,
or
if
there
was
some
evidence
of
some
special
knowledge
that
either
of
my
clients
possessed
below,
then
that
was
not
put
forward
by
the
plaintiff
at
that
time,
and
it
would...
our
position
would
be
that
in
this
case
if
the
court
should
decide
that
there
should
be
an
extension
of
immunity
but
it
should
be
something
other
than
the
objective
or
reasonable
objectiveness
standard
from
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
that
remand
would
not
be
necessary,
because
there's
no
indication
of
any
lack
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--your
honor,
i
would
rely
upon
what
the
district
judge
stated,
and
that
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
execution
or
use
of
the
statute
by
john
robbins,
that
there
was
not
complete
agreement
about
the
law.
for
instance,
in
the
mitchell
v.
w.t.
grant
case
involving,
i
believe
it's
louisiana
sequestration
statute,
there
was
some
similar
infirmities
there.
for
instance,
i
think
that
in
that
case,
or
in
the
case
of
that
statute,
that
the
writ
of
sequestration
could
be
issued
by
a
clerk
and
there
was
a
provision
there
that
the
person
against
whom
the
writ
was
issued
could
come
into
court
and
seek
a
dissolution,
but
there
were
similar
safeguards
available
to
the
mississippi
statute,
and
i
would
say
this.
in
1975,
the
mississippi
legislature
revised
an
earlier
edition
of
the
replevin
statute
because
the
first
edition
which
i'm
familiar
with
did
not
have
the
requirement
of
bond,
did
not
have
the
availability
for
advancing
the
course
on
the
docket,
and
so
i
would
say
that
a
reasonable
attorney
even
with
more
expertise
in
the
area
than
mr.
robbins
had
would
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
i'm
not,
your
honor,
and
mr.
waide
erroneously
stated
that
i
cited
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
i
don't
believe
that
i
did,
and
i
checked
my
table
of
contents
to
see
if
i'd
just
forgotten
it.
your
honor,
if
there
had
been
malicious
conduct
on
the
part
of
my
clients
in
this
case
there
was
a
remedy
available
under
state
law,
and
in
fact
the
remedy
available
under
state
law
for
the
wrongful
attachment
was
a
remedy
of
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case
chose
not
to
avail
himself.
i
would
concede
under
mississippi
law
that
the
damages
which
are
available
for
the
suing
out
of
wrongful
attachment
would
not
include
the
mental
anguish
which
mr.
wyatt
alleges
to
have
suffered,
but
there
are
mississippi
cases
which--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
the
damages
for
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you
for
helping
me
out...
or
their
change
of
attitude,
or
whatever
therapy
might
be
necessary
for
those
cattle.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
your
honor,
mr.
waide
knows
a
lot
more
about
brahmas
than
i
do,
but
those
damages
would
be
available
if
there
had
been
a
decrease
in
the
market
value
of
those
cattle
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
their
behavior,
then
that
could
be
recovered
under
mississippi
law.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
certainly,
your
honor,
no
question
about
that,
and
what
we
say
is...
we
do
not
challenge
that
point.
what
we
say
is,
there
is
an
immunity
which
ought
to
be
available
for
the
public
policy
reasons
which
i've
stated.
i
think
the
emphasis
that
i
would
want
to
place
on
public
policy
reasons
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
and
i
believe
that
this
circuit
alluded
to
this
in
the
folsom
investment
company
case,
it
said
that
the
first
line
of
defense
in
these
cases
should
be
the
legislature
who
passed
it,
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
who
in
some
instances
would
enforce
statutes,
and
that
the
burden
of
paying
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
statute
should
not
fall
upon
persons
such
as
wyatt
and
cole.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
no,
your
honor,
in
the
joint
appendix
which
was
submitted
where
judge
barbour,
the
district
judge
in
this
case,
was
citing
to
circuit
court
judge
jerry
yeager's
opinion,
after
dismissing
the
attachment
that
judge
yeager
said
that
mr.
wyatt
would
be
able
to
recover
damages
for
wrongful
attachment,
that
in
the
initial
suit
in
circuit
court
is
that
judge
yeager
said
the
replevin
statute
was
not
what
should
have
been
utilized
because
these
gentlemen
were
partners
and
they
should
not
have
resorted
to
the
replevin
statute,
so
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
judge
yeager
was
prepared
to
award
some
damages
but
it
wasn't
all
the
damages
mr.
wyatt
felt
that
he
was
entitled.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
right,
your
honor.
there
was
not
a
declaration
in
the
circuit
court
of
unconstitutionality.
it
was
simply,
you've
picked
out
the
wrong
attempted
remedy,
mr.
cole,
by
coming
here,
because
you
are
partners,
and
you
should
seek
dissolution
of
your
partnership
and
proceed
under
that
particular
set
of
statutes
in
mississippi
which
provides
for
the
splitting
up
of
partnerships.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
the
earlier
edition.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
was
not
aware
of...
it
is
cited
in...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it's
cited
in
our
petition,
the
underwood
v.
foremost
financial
services
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
it
was
in
the
brief
of
respondents
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
3.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
was
examining
the
application
of
good
faith
immunity
to
private
defendants
under
color
of
state
law.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
no,
your
honor,
i
was
not.
what
the
petitioner
wants
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
deny
the
extension
of
immunity,
and
when
this
court
has
denied
the
extension
of
immunity
it
has
relied
in
part
on
policy
grounds
and
part
on
the
historical
inquiry
which
i'll
get
to
in
a
second,
but
for
instance,
in
owen
v.
city
of
independence,
the
court
there
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
makes
the
comment
basically
that
it
is
as
a
matter
of
policy
equating
the
role...
has
done
equity
in
that
it
would
provide
a
plaintiff
with
a
remedy,
it
would
allow
the
official
who
acts
in
good
faith
to
go
about
his
duties
without
fear
of
being
dragged
into
court,
and
it
makes
the
public
pay
only
for
those
unconstitutional
policies
which
the
state
enforces,
and
so
therefore
it
spreads
the
liability
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
among
the
citizens
of
the
state,
and
that
would
not
be
done
in
this
case.
it
would
be
quite
the
opposite.
it
would
be
placed
upon
the
private
party.
as
far
as
the
historical
analysis
is
concerned,
this
court
has
looked
at
historical
analyses
most
strongly
when
it
was
denying...
or
when
it
was
granting
full
immunity
as
in
the
case
of
legislatures,
prosecutors,
and
judges.
in
the
later
inquiries
there
is
not...
such
as
in
anderson
v.
creighton,
there
has
not
been
the
great
reliance
upon
historical
precedent.
when
a
police
officer
at
common
law
did
not
have
reasonable
grounds
to
act
in
effectuating
an
arrest
or
carrying
out
a
search,
then
he
had
a
defense
which
was
based
upon
a
subjective
standard,
and
this
court
in
anderson
v.
creighton
adopted
the
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
standard
and
said
we
will
make
it
an
objective
reasonableness
standard.
there's
no
reason,
logically,
then,
why
that
same
standard
cannot
translate
to
be
utilized
by
the
private
defendant,
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
that
wyatt
overlooks
is
that
the
good
faith...
or
excuse
me,
the
objective
reasonableness
standard
which
is
applied
as
an
immunity
in
these
cases
is,
after
all,
an
affirmative
defense,
and
so
the
party
asserting
that
affirmative
defense
has
to
come
forward
and
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
would
come
under
terms
of
the
immunity.
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
mr.
wyatt...
or
excuse
me,
mr.
cole
and
mr.
robbins
utilized
a
statute
which
neither
of
them
had
reason
to
believe
was
unconstitutional,
and
they
were
attempting
to
go
about
utilizing
an
orderly
process,
although
it
turned
out
to
be
the
wrong
process,
and
the
court's
reasoning
below
in
the
fifth
circuit
for
the
granting
of
extension
of
immunity
should
be
adopted
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
they
had,
all
of
those
had
been.
mr.
joseph
l.
mcnamara
no,
your
honor,
because
the
mississippi
replevin
statute
says...
or
provides
for
a
person
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
taking
of
the
property,
and
i
believe
it
gives
it
a
hearing
within
3
days
to
seek
to
set
aside
the
writ
of
replevin,
and
it
would
seem
at
least
under
what
this
court
said
in
the
mitchell
case
that
there
were
sufficient
constitutional
safeguards,
but
the
important
issue
perhaps
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
is
in
judging
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
under
the
objective
reasonable
standard,
that
the
trial
court
said
that
objectively
it
could
be
determined
that
the
statute
was
not
one
which
was
clearly
unconstitutional
at
the
time.
your
honor,
the
extension
of
qualified
immunity
in
this
situation
would
be
uniform,
it
would
be
in
keeping
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
it
would
be
a
just
resolution
for
private
party
defendants
who
until
lugar
v.
edmondson
were...
those
were
among
a
class
of
persons
who
by
most
lawyers
were
not
even
dreamed
to
be
potential
section
1983
defendants,
and
the
holdings
in
the
adickes
v.
s.h.
kress
company,
and
in
other
cases
where
a
private
party
acts
in
conspiracy
with
a
judge
or
public
official,
those
holdings
would
be
held
intact,
and
furthermore,
to
use
the
example
of
adickes
v.
kress
case,
even
if
the
court
decided
to
grant
qualified
immunity
in
a
situation
such
as
that,
those
parties
would
not
meet
the
objective
reasonableness
standard
because
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
as
is
said
in...
i
believe
in
the
dissent
in
lugar
v.
edmondson
makes
a
comment
about
adickes
v.
kress
having
occurred
some
10
years
after
brown
v.
board
of
education,
and
for
the
public
policy
reasons
and
because
there's
adequate
historical
basis
for
an
analogy
to
give
a
good
faith
defense,
and
because
this
court
has
adopted
across
the
board
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
and
other
qualified
immunity
cases,
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit.
