well,
just
to
follow
up
on
the
question
by
the
chief
justice,
is
it
open
to
the
respondent
to
argue
that
the
eighth
circuit
case,
collins,
improperly...
was
improperly
overruled,
that
it
was
right
all
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
is
before
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
position
is
entirely
consistent
with
teague,
that
you
generally
look
at
the
law
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
legal
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
the
same...
would
you
give
the
same
view
if
instead
of
being
an
overruling
there
had
been
a
statutory
change,
say
that
an
objection
might
have
been
proper
at
the
time
of
trial
and
then
by
the
time
it
gets
to
review
and
habeas
corpus
the
legislature
changes
some
rule
and
you
no
longer
could
make
that
objection?
would
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
failing
to
make
the
objection
also
be
judged,
in
your
view,
by
the
time
after
the
legislation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but...
could
i
interrupt
you?
the
constitutional
violation
of
these
claims
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
thought
it
was
agreed
by
everyone
that
counsel
was
in
fact
ineffective,
but
your
claim
is
that
there
was
no
prejudice
from
the
ineffective--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right,
but
you
do
agree
that
it
was
ineffective
to
fail
to
make
an
objection
that
was
indicated
by
a
recently
decided
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
on
the
prejudice
point,
if
one
assumes
that
even
though
the
trial
judge
might
have
had
the
power
to
not
follow
it,
but
if
one
assumes
as
a
matter
of
probabilities
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
sustained
the
objection
because
there's
a
recent
eighth
circuit
case
out
there
that
was
directly
on
point,
that
that
would
have
meant
he
would
have
not
gotten
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
not...
you
don't
think
that's
sufficient
to
show
prejudice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
think
the
difference
between
life
and
death
is
prejudice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
your
answer.
suppose
we
think
that
collins
was
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
should...
is
it
open
to
us
to
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
waxman,
just
refresh
my
recollection.
this
is
an
indigent
opponent
you
have.
did
he
have
counsel
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
make
a
difference
to
you
as
far
as
waiving
this
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
lowenfield
had
never
been
decided,
would
it
have
been
open
to
the
state
to
argue
on
habeas
that
the
collins
case
was
wrong
and
therefore
there
was
no
prejudice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
though
the
trial
judge
would
have...
well,
okay,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
medlock,
our...
in
the
papers,
does
the...
are
the
seven
different
felonies
anywhere
in
the
briefs?
justice
scalia
is
referring
to
seven
felonies,
and
you're
talking
about
seven
felonies.
how
do
i...
i
suppose
i
could
look
it
up
in
the
library,
but
do
the
papers--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--has
the
whole
statute
in
it.
