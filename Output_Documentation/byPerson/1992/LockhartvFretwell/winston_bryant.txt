mr.
winston
bryant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
believes
the
general
issue
in
this
case
to
be
whether
counsel
for
mr.
fretwell
was
ineffective
under
the
sixth
amendment
when
he
failed
to
raise
a
double-counting
issue
that
may
have
benefited
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial
but
which
has
subsequently
been
shown
by
a
decision
of
this
court
to
be
without
merit.
i
would
like
to
recite
a
few
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
because
their
order
is
important.
in
april
of
1985,
fretwell
lied
in
wait,
entered
the
home
of
the
victim,
stole
his
money
at
gunpoint,
and
shot
the
victim
in
the
head
and
killed
him.
fretwell
and
two
companions
fled
in
the
victim's
pickup
truck.
fretwell
was
tried
in
august
of
1985,
and
the
jury
convicted
him
of
capital
felony
murder.
the
case
was
bifurcated
into
a
guilt-innocence
phase
and
a
penalty
phase.
after
conviction,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
on
two
aggravating
circumstances:
1)
murder
committed
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
or
preventing
an
arrest,
and
2)
murder
committed
for
pecuniary
gain.
the
jury
found
only
murder
for
pecuniary
gain
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
and
found
no
mitigating
circumstances.
fretwell's
counsel
failed
to
object
to
the
submission
of
pecuniary
gain
to
the
jury
despite
the
fact
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
handed
down
collins
v.
lockhart
in
january
of
the
same
year,
in
1985.
collins
held
that
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
prohibit
the
use
of
pecuniary
gain
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
capital
felony
murder
trials
where
murder...
where
robbery-murder
is
the
capital
offense
at
issue.
fretwell
then
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
the
issue
of
double
counting
was
raised,
but
the
court,
the
supreme
court,
decided...
declined
to
decide
the
issue
because
it
had
not
been
raised
at
the
trial
level.
then
in
april
of
'87
the
arkansas
supreme
court
denied
fretwell's
application
for
post-judgment
relief.
then
in
may
of
that
year,
1987,
he
filed
a
habeas
petition
in
federal
district
court
claiming
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
now,
in
january
of
1988,
shortly
after
he
filed
his
habeas
petition,
this
court
handed
down
lowenfield
v.
phelps.
lowenfield
held
that
a
death
sentence
does
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment
simply
because
an
aggravating
circumstance
found
by
the
jury
duplicated
an
element
of
the
underlying
criminal
offense.
to
pass
constitutional
muster,
a
capital
sentencing
scheme
must
genuinely
narrow
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
overruled
by
the
perry
case...
well,
actually,
the
lowenfield
case
prior
to
the
perry
case...
but
the
issue
before
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
is
whether
or
not
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
under
the
sixth
amendment
has
been
met,
and
the
state's
position
is
that
when
lowenfield
was
decided
it
was
based
on
a
decision
by
this
court
in
jurek
v.
texas,
decided
in
1976,
and
therefore
was
not
new
law
that
applied
to
the
fretwell
situation.
after
lowenfield
was
decided,
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
perry
case,
perry
v.
lockhart,
which
overruled
collins,
specifically
considered
the
death
sentencing
scheme
in
arkansas
and
said
that
it
was
not
indistinguishable
from
that
in
the
lowenfield
decision,
which
talked
about
the
death
penalty
sentencing
scheme
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
but
after
that,
the
federal
district
court
in
little
rock
issued
a
decision
and
rejected
all
claims
that
fretwell
had
made
in
his
habeas
petition,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
court
found
that
the
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
because
the
pecuniary
gain
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
had
not
been
objected
to
at
the
trial
court
level,
and
then
the
district
court
directed
that
mr.
fretwell
either
be
resentenced
or
his
conviction
reduced
to
life
without
parole.
and
then
in
september
of
1991
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
with
one
exception.
they
directed
that
mr.
fretwell's
sentence
be
reduced
to
life
without
parole.
so--
mr.
winston
bryant
--it's
our
position
that
that
issue
is
before
this
court
and--
mr.
winston
bryant
--the
issue
is
before
the
court,
the
collins
decision,
simply
because
that
was
the
basis
for
fretwell's
claim.
it's
the
position
of
the
state
that
collins
was
bad
law
at
the
time,
and
even
if
you
do
not
accept
that
theory,
under
the
lowenfield
decision
it
was
overruled
and
under
our
concept,
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
strickland
test,
the
reviewing
court
must
consider
whether
or
not
the
prejudice
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
reviewing...
the
reviewing
court
makes
its
decision,
and
not
at
the
time
the
alleged
errors
of
counsel
were
made.
mr.
winston
bryant
it's
our
position
that
if
you
look
at
the
performance
prong
of
the
strickland
test
that
you
look
at
the
alleged
errors
at
the
time
they
were
made.
if
you
look
at
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
strickland
test,
it's
our
position
that
the
reviewing
court
should
look
at
it
at
the
time
the
review
is
made.
mr.
winston
bryant
quite
frankly,
i
have
not
considered
that
question,
but
i
think
that
there
would
be...
you
could
argue
more
forcefully
for
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
in
that
instance,
because
the
legislative
act
would
occur
after
the
fact.
mr.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct.
mr.
winston
bryant
and
if...
that
is
the
reason
why
that
we
think
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
overruled,
because
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
really
stops...
when
they
consider
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
strickland
test,
they
stop
at
the
time
the
alleged
counsel's
errors
were
made,
and
we
think
that
is
incorrect.
we
think
the
prejudice
prong
should
be
considered
at
the
time
of
the
reviewing
court
decision.
in
addition
to
that,
the
eighth
circuit
court
used
as
a
basis
for
its
decision
the
supremacy
clause.
in
this
particular
case,
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
fretwell
decision
held
that
the
trial
court
should
have
followed
collins
because
collins
had
been
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
january
before
the
trial
occurred
in
august.
using
the
supremacy
clause
as
a
basis,
the
eighth
circuit
directed
that
the
arkansas
court
should
have
followed
collins.
it's
our
position
that
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
apply
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
the
great
weight
of
authority
is
that
the
state
courts
are
not
bound
to
follow
decisions
of
the
lower
federal
courts.
they're
co-equal
parts
of
the
judicial
system,
and
so
the
arkansas
court
was
not
bound
to
follow
collins.
and
in
fact,
had
the
issue
come
up
and
the
attorney
for
fretwell
had
made
an
objection
to
the
use
of
pecuniary
gain
as
an
aggravating
circumstance,
we
think
that
the
better
rule
for
the
court
to
have
followed...
the
court
would
have
been
bound
to
have
followed
the
jurek
v.
texas
decision
which
was
already
on
the
books,
and
so
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
decision
by
the
eighth
circuit
is,
quite
frankly,
incorrect
in
its
applications.
mr.
winston
bryant
justice
white,
the--
mr.
winston
bryant
--as
compared
to
a
decision
by
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
winston
bryant
but
the
jurek
v.
texas
decision
had
been
decided
by
this
court
in
'76,
and
quite
frankly,
the
arkansas
trial
court
in
our
opinion
would
have
been
bound
to
follow
jurek
v.
texas--
mr.
winston
bryant
--because
collins
was
bad
law
at
the
time,
and
i
think
that
was
pointed
out
by
the
dissent
in
the
fretwell
case,
and
of
course
perry
specifically
overruled
the
collins
decision
after
the
fact.
mr.
winston
bryant
we--
mr.
winston
bryant
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
feel
that
the
habeas
claim
is
not
meritorious
and
it
should
be
decided
against
mr.
fretwell,
simply
because
he
is
not
alleging
any
constitutional
right
that
has
been
violated
against
him.
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury--
mr.
winston
bryant
--was
bad
law
at
the
time.
mr.
winston
bryant
that
is
correct.
mr.
winston
bryant
the
prejudice
prong
has
not
been
met.
mr.
winston
bryant
yes,
and
we
did
not
challenge
that
at
the
eighth
circuit,
nor
have
we
challenged
it--
mr.
winston
bryant
--that
is
correct.
mr.
winston
bryant
well,
the
real
issue
in
this
particular
case
is
the
definition
and
the
parameters
on
the
prejudice
prong
in
the
strickland
case.
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
winston
bryant
--well,
i
think
the
issue
is
really
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
because
he's
raising
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
and
what
the
eighth
circuit
has
done
is
focus
its
inquiry
on
whether
or
not
there
would
have
been
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
would
have
been
different.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
strickland,
nix,
and
kimmelman
cases
all
require
a...
in
analyzing
that
aspect
of
the
prejudice
prong
do
not
only
look
at
whether
or
not
the
result
may
have
been
different,
but
look
at
whether
the
counsel's
errors
were
so
serious
as
to
impair
the
adversarial
process
to
where
the
defendant
would
not
receive
a
fair
trial
and
a
just
result,
and
that
is
the
real
focus
of
this
inquiry,
and
when
that
is
the
test,
fretwell
does
not
meet
the...
or
does
not
meet
constitutional
muster
on
proving
his
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
with
that,
the
petitioner
will
reserve
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
winston
bryant
maybe
i
misspoke
to
a
certain
extent
when
i
said
we
completely
agreed
that
counsel
was
ineffective.
we
have
taken
a
position
of
not
challenging
that,
and
we
did
not
challenge
that
before
the
eighth
circuit,
and
we
haven't
challenged--
mr.
winston
bryant
--well--
mr.
winston
bryant
--yes,
that
is
correct,
but
to
explain,
the
issue
that
we're
raising
in
this
case
is
the
prejudice
prong
and
according
to
the
kimmelman
case
that
can
be
considered
first
before
the
performance
prong
of
the
strickland
test.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time--
mr.
winston
bryant
--mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
winston
bryant
regarding
a
point
that
has
been
raised,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
considered
the
lowenfield
decision.
as
i
stated,
it
was
raised
in
the
fretwell
case
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
did
not
decide
the
issue
because
it
was
not
raised
at
the
trial
level.
later,
in
1988,
in
the
case
of
o'rourke
v.
state,
the
appellant,
relying
on
collins,
asserted
that
he
was
denied
due
process
and
the
arkansas
court
in
responding
to
that
claim
basically
said
that,
as
was
the
case
with
louisiana's
death
penalty
law
which
was
considered
in
lowenfield,
the
duplicative
nature
of
arkansas'
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
did
not
render
appellant's
sentencing
infirm
and
the
constitution
requires
no
more.
so
the
arkansas
court
has
considered
the
lowenfield
issue,
the
double-counting
issue,
and
in
addition
to
that
the
eighth
circuit
in
perry
also
approved
the
arkansas
capital
sentencing
scheme.
in
view
of
lowenfield
comparing
the
arkansas
statute
with
louisiana
statute
as
well
as
the
texas
statute
under
jurek,
arkansas
does
narrow
those
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
reference
has
been
made
to
stringer
v.
black.
that
case
is
not
applicable
to
our
situation
because
stringer
v.
black
involved
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
too
broad
and
was
not
specific
enough,
and
this
court
said
so.
we
do
not
have
a
problem
in
fretwell
with
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
is
too
broad.
quite
the
contrary.
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
any
allegation
made
that
pecuniary
gain
is
too
broad.
it
is
specific.
one
other
point
that
i
would
make
is
that,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
pecuniary
gain
in
arkansas
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
the
criminal
offense
of
robbery.
mr.
winston
bryant
yes,
that
has
been
held
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court
in
a
number
of
decisions,
which
is
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
and
so
because
of
that,
because
it's
only
a
motive,
it's
not
necessary
that
pecuniary
gain
be
proven,
so
in
that
regard
it
is
not
a
duplicate
element
of
the
initial
offense.
however,
in
the
state's
view
that
is
not
relevant
anyway,
because
we
do
sufficiently
narrow
at
the
guilt
phase,
and
that
is
all
that
is
required
under
this
court's
rulings
in
the
past.
if
there
are
no
questions,
then--
mr.
winston
bryant
--thank
you.
