justice
byron
r.
white
then
it's
just
as
though
prior
to
collins
the
arkansas
supreme
court
had
said
double
counting
is
all
right
and
refused
to
change
its
rule
in
the
light
of
collins.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
arkansas,
until
it's
overruled
by
this
court,
can
have
its
own
view
of
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
just
ask
you,
why
do
you...
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
concede
that
it
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
because
the
arkansas
law
wasn't
necessarily
what
the...
the
arkansas
view
of
the
constitution
was
not
necessarily
the
same
as,
or
controlled
by
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
you're
willing
to
have
it
judged
on
the
ground
that
the
counsel
was
ineffective
when
he
failed
to
object.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
it's
either
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
state
says
it
isn't...
there's
no
new
rule,
because
what
the
attorney
did
was
consistent
with
jurek.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
new
rule
you
think
is...
is
that
the
petitioner's
trying
to
establish?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
just
remember
that
he
might
have
gotten
relief
from
the
district
court.
he
may
not
have
gotten
it
up
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe,
but
the
eighth
circuit
wasn't
the
final
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
eighth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
order
for
a
new
sentencing
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
say
the
eighth
circuit
was
right
in
applying
the
law
that
was...
that
it
had
announced,
namely,
powers.
justice
byron
r.
white
perry.
i
think
perry,
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
so
they
applied
their
later
decision
as
a
basis
for
not
ordering
a
new
sentencing
hearing,
because
there
couldn't
be
any
remedy--
justice
byron
r.
white
--although
they
could
have
ordered
a
new
sentencing
hearing
without
the
use
of
the
aggravating
circumstance,
couldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
i
ask
you,
why
didn't
they...
why
did
they
choose
to
just
say...
to
impose
a
life
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
some
later
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
constitution
was
always
what
they
said
it
was
in
perry.
well,
go
ahead,
counselor.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
arguing
as
a
respondent
here
that
we
should
affirm
on
this
particular
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
collins
was
wrong.
collins
was
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
collins
was
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah...
yeah,
and
perry
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
have
just...
you've
been
arguing
it...
that,
though,
as
another
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
you
were
right
that
the
arkansas
capital
punishment
statute
doesn't
adequately
narrow
those
people...
to
those
people
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
you
would
say,
then,
that
the
whole
statute
is
invalid
as
a
death
penalty
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
do
you
say
is
wrong
with
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
eighth
circuit
was
right
in
saying
that
if
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
imposed
it's
necessarily
life?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you...
it
would
be
consistent
with
your
argument
to
say
you
were
entitled
to
a
new
sentencing
hearing
where
the...
where
life
was
not
the
necessary
penalty.
