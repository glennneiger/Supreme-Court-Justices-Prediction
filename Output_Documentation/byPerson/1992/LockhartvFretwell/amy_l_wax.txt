ms.
amy
l.
wax
before
i
begin,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
just
address
the
question
of
whether
it's
open
to
respondent
to
argue
that
lowenfield
does
not
apply
to
the
arkansas
death
penalty
statute
and
that
lowenfield
didn't
overrule
collins.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is...
that
the
court
should
consider
that
issue
as
a
possible
ground
for
affirmance
because
the
premise
of
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
was
that
lowenfield
did
overrule
collins
and
respondent
did
not
dispute
that
in
his
opposition
to
the
petition.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think
the
court
in
its
discretion
could,
based
on
this
court's
recent
pronouncements
on
whether
it
should
delve
into
the
merits
of
a
predicate
that
is
not
questioned
by
respondent
in
its
opposition.
for
example,
in
eastman
kodak
v.
technical
imaging
just
last
term,
we
think
that
it
would
not
comport
with
this
court's
recent
practice
to
do
that.
we
don't
understand
the
court
as
being
absolutely
barred
from
doing
it.
we
just
think
that
as
a
matter
of
prudential
rule
that
it
would
not
be
the
proper
course
in
this
case.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
he
did
have
counsel,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
government's
view
in
this
case
is
that
respondent's
counsel
was
not
ineffective
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
habeas
relief
because
his
counsel
failed
to
make
an
objection
to
his
sentencing
that
this
court's
subsequent
cases
show
to
be
without
merit.
there
are
two
reasons
for
this.
first,
respondent's
counsel
was
not
ineffective
because
respondent
suffered
no
legally
cognizable
prejudice
from
his
counsel's
conduct
of
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial.
that
is
because
the
procedures
employed
at
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial
were
perfectly
valid
under
the
eighth
amendment.
thus--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--i
think
the
way
to
look
at
it
is,
was
counsel's
conduct
deficient?
ineffectiveness
is
the
final
inquiry--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
did
not
argue
that
his
counsel--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that
his
conduct
was
not
deficient
because
the
state
did
not
press
that
issue
below,
although
we
think
it's
debatable,
and
we
also
would
disagree
with
the
district
court's
test
that
it
applied
to
find
counsel's
conduct
deficient.
we
don't
think
the
test
should
be
that
counsel
needs
to
be
aware
of
every
single
death
penalty
case.
however,
we're
not
before
this
court
to
contest
deficiency.
our
argument
rests
on
a
view
of
legally
cognizable
prejudice
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
our
view
is
that
counsel's
conduct
did
not
deprive
respondent
of
his
right
to
effective
assistance
because
it
did
not
deprive
him
of
a
fair
sentencing
or
of
a
constitutional
right
designed
to
procure
a
fair
sentencing,
which
is
this
court's
test
in
strickland
v.
washington.
the
second
reason
that
respondent's
claim
must
fail--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
right.
that's
implicit--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--you
don't
have
a
simple
right
not
to
have
your
counsel
make
an
error,
not
to
have
your
counsel
fall
below
a
professional
level
of
competence.
you
don't
have
a
right,
you
know,
to
that.
you
have
a
right
to
a
fair
sentencing
or
trial,
or
one
whose
outcome
is
reliable,
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
designed
to
advance,
procure,
obtain
that
result,
correct.
the
second
reason
that
respondent's
claim
fails
is
that
the
habeas
corpus
statute
itself,
28
u.s.c.
2254(a),
provides
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
habeas
relief
only
if
he
shows
that
he
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
respondent
could
not
make
that
showing,
because
as
of
the
time
that
the
court
granted
habeas
relief,
there
was
no
constitutional
defect
in
the
procedures
used
to
sentence
him.
now,
with
regard
to
respondent's
sixth
amendment
claim,
he
claims
that
he
should
receive
relief
because
his
attorney
failed
to
make
an
objection
based
on
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling
in
collins
v.
lockhart
which
bars
the
submission
of
a
redundant
aggravating
circumstance
at
the
penalty
phase
of
a
trial
for
a
capital
offense.
now,
under
a
straightforward
reading
of
strickland,
respondent
could
not
possibly
have
an
ineffective
assistance
claim.
to
so
prejudice
under
strickland,
it
is
necessary
first
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
outcome
of
the
case
might
have
been
different,
but
that's
not
enough.
you
also
have
to
show
that
counsel's
error
was
so
serious
that
it
deprived
the
person
of
a
fair
trial
or
a
reliable
outcome.
now,
under
lowenfield
v.
phelps,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
what
happened
at
the
penalty
phase
of
respondent's
trial
and
therefore
he
cannot
meet
that
condition
so
he
is
not
entitled
to
habeas
relief.
the
second
argument
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--exactly,
and
that's
because--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
that's
because
there's
only
one
constitution
and
either
collins
was
right
or
it
wasn't
right,
and
a
basic
tenet
of
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
is
that
we
apply
the
present
view
of
the
law.
the
present
view
of
the
law
is
presumed
to
be
the
correct
view
of
the
law,
and
that
is
the
view
that
controls
whether
or
not
an
individual
has
been
deprived
of
their
constitutional
rights.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
his
contention
is
that
his
trial
is
unfair
because
there
as
a
constitutional...
he's
saying
that
there
was
an
eighth
amendment
defect
in
his
trial
because
collins
addresses
the
eighth
amendment
viability
of
the
proceeding.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
exactly.
so
we
are
saying
that
there
was
no
constitutional
defect.
his
sixth
amendment
claim
happens
to
be
predicated
on
the
further
claim
that
there
was
constitutional
prejudice.
not
all
sixth
amendment
claims
are
like
that,
but
this
one
happens
to
be.
now,
the
second
independent--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no,
the
standard
is
broader
than
that,
because
it
encompasses...
you're
saying
for
a
sixth
amendment
violation--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--what's
the
standard?
the
standard
is...
for
prejudice
is
really
a
two-part
standard.
the
first
is
a
purely
mechanical
inquiry:
is
there
a
reasonable
possibility
the
outcome
would
have
been
different?
that's
just
the
first
part.
the
second
part
is,
would
that
error,
the
different
outcome...
is
it
one
that
detracts
from
the
fairness
of
the
trial
or
from
the
reliability
of
the
outcome,
or
deprives
the
individual
of
a
right
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
outcome
or
the
fairness
of
the
trial?
now,
obviously,
if
counsel's
error
resulted
in
the
eighth
amendment
violation,
that
would
make
the
result
less
reliable,
because
it
means
that
the
jury
would
have
imposed
the
death
penalty
in
a
manner
that
does
not
comport
with
the
eighth
amendment,
and
that's
precisely
what
we're
saying
didn't
happen
here.
everything
that
happened
at
the
penalty
phase
comported
with
the
eighth
amendment
as
this
court
stated
the
requirements
of
the
eighth
amendment
under
lowenfield
v.
phelps.
now,
the
district--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--i
think
that
it
might
have
been...
yes,
it
might
have
been
open
to
them
to
do
that,
because
they
could
have
sought
in
effect
the
lowenfield
ruling.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
mean,
the
court
could
have
rejected
the
habeas
claim
on
the
basis
of
the
lowenfield
insight,
so
to
speak.
now,
the
district
court
was
also
wrong
to
grant
the
habeas
relief
for
the
independent
reason
that
the
habeas
statute
itself
does
not
authorize
that
relief.
section
2254(a)
requires
a
defendant
as
a
threshold
matter
to
show
that
he
is
being
held
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
