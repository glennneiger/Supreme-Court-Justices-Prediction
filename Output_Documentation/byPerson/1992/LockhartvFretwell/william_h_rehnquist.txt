we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-1393,
a.l.
lockhart
v.
bobby
ray
fretwell.
general
bryant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
bryant,
the
question
you
present
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
seems
to
me
to
assume
that
the
collins
case
was
properly
overruled
by
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
basis
of
lowenfield.
i
don't
see
that
we
have
here
any
issue
as
to
whether
that
overruling
was
correct
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
position
is
basically
that
the
defendant
shouldn't
have
a
windfall,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
ruling
that
he
would
not
ultimately
have
been
entitled
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
we
aren't
interested
just
in
deciding
the
facts
of
this...
you
know,
whether
this
case
should
be
reversed
or
affirmed.
i
think
we're
interested
in
getting
at
the
question
of
whether
assuming
that
collins
was
an
eighth
circuit
decision
that
stood
for
a
while
and
then
was
later
overruled
in
perry,
you
know,
what
should
be
the
effect
of
that
on
the
respondent's
habeas
corpus
rights--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
assistance
of
counsel
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that...
if
you
divide
the
issue
into
whether
counsel
was
ineffective
and
whether
there
was
prejudice
under
strickland,
that...
what
you're
talking
really
goes
to
the
prejudice
part,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
you're
willing
to
agree
that
counsel's
performance
was
deficient,
as
you
put
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
he's
not
entitled
to
relief
because
the
trial
was
fair.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
suggests
that
perhaps
there
might
have
been
a
constitutional
violation,
but
nonetheless
it
was
fair.
it's
accurate
to
say
here,
isn't
it,
that
your
position
is
he's
not
entitled
to
relief
because
no
constitutional
violation...
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
which
occurred
at
his
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
why
the
case
is
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
medlock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
the
question
raised
on
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
arkansas
statute
was
like
the
louisiana
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
attorney
general
had
said
it
was
raised
but
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
refused
to
pass
on
it.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
i
understand
it,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
never
opined
as
to
whether
it
is...
the
arkansas
statute
is
like
the
louisiana
statute,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
medlock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
this
case
had
been
tried
before
a
trial
judge
who
was
known
to
have
a
propensity
for
granting
verdicts
of
acquittal
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case
and
the...
it
was
also
known
that
they
were
frequently
unjustified,
and
the
state
put
in
a
very
good
case
that
any
reasonable
observer
would
say
yes,
this
is
surely
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
the
defense
lawyer
fails
to
make
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
and...
can
he
come
back
later
and
say,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
because
this
particular
judge
was
a
real
softie
for
this
kind
of
motion?
it's
very
likely
he
would
have
granted
it,
although
it
wouldn't
have
been
justified,
and
there's
no
appeal
from
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
might
have
depended
a
little
bit
on
the
pace
of
his
appeal,
post-conviction
state
proceedings,
and
proceedings
in
federal
habeas,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
all
depend
whether
his
case
got
to
the
eighth
circuit
before
or
after
lowenfield
was
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
medlock,
since
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
not
spoken
on
the
subject,
and
since
the
eighth
circuit
regularly
deals
with
arkansas
capital
cases,
even
if
this
issue
were
technically
open,
wouldn't
it
make
more
sense
for
us
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
as
to
what
impact
lowenfield
has
on
the
arkansas
statute?
we
don't
deal
regularly
with
the
arkansas
capital
statute,
and
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
has
never
expressed
an
opinion
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
i
don't...
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
take
either
your
word
or
your
opponent's
word
as
to
whether
a
particular
opinion
is
erroneous.
i
think
our
practice
has
been
in
a
situation
like
that,
if
it's
an
interpretation
of
application
of
federal
constitutional
principles
to
a
state
sentencing
scheme,
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
analysis
of
state
law,
we
tend
to
take
the
word
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
court
of
appeals
that
sees
a
lot
more
cases
than
we
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
medlock.
general
bryant,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
arkansas
supreme
court
ever
so
held--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
bryant.
the
case
is
submitted.
