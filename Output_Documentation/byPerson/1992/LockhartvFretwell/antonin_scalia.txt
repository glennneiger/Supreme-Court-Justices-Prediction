you
don't
really
have
a
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
do
you,
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
convicted...
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
convicted
because
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that
it
was
not
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
that
was
the
cause
of
the
conviction
here,
but
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
--those
really
weren't
changes
in
the
law.
i
mean,
they
were
just...
the
law
was
always
that.
it
just
so
happened
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
gotten
it
wrong
4
years
earlier,
and
we
didn't
discover
that
they
were
wrong,
or
it
was
not
publicly
announced
that
they
were
wrong
until
4
years
later.
that's
different
from
saying
the
law
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
medlock,
just
coming
back
to
collins
again,
why
isn't
the
arkansas
scheme
sufficiently
narrowing
even
if
you
assume,
as
collins
does,
that
it's
improper
to
count
the
pecuniary
gain
element?
i
mean,
why
isn't
there
a
narrowing
of
all
the
categories
of
people
who
kill,
in
two
respects:
the
statute
limits
it
to
those
who
kill
with
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life,
which
is,
i
think,
necessary
under
our
case
law
to
influence
capital
punishment,
but
then
narrows
it
further.
you
have
to
kill
with
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life,
and
in
the
course
of
one
of
these
seven
felonies.
why
isn't
that
enough
narrowing,
even
without
the
pecuniary
gain
sub-part?
why
do
you
need
pecuniary
gain?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
something...
one
of
seven
felonies.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
what
case
of
ours
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
a
culpable
mental...
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life,
and
he's
committing
one
of
seven
felonies.
isn't
that
a
narrowing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
that's
essentially
the
same
as
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
we
have
narrowed.
we've
said,
only
those
who
have
that
mental
state
and
are
committing
one
of
these
seven
felonies.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
what?
what
precedent
says
it's
insufficient?
i
mean,
it's
certainly
a
narrowing.
i
don't
know
that
we
have
any
precedent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
well,
they
must
be
right,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
about
its
own
law,
we're
talking
about
federal
constitutional
law,
and
i
think
what
they
have
to
say
about
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
certainly
not...
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he's
not
arguing
that
that's
standing
alone.
i
mean,
that
is
a
mental
state...
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
he's
arguing
that
plus
the
narrowing
factor
of
the
commission
of
one
of
seven
enumerated
felonies.
why
isn't
that
a
narrowing,
a
considerable
narrowing?
justice
antonin
scalia
--anything
in
tison
that
says
so.
what
in
tison
says
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
we
have
a
mental
state
element
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
the
broadest
group
that
could
potentially
be
created
is
anyone
who
kills
with
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
that's
the
broadest
category.
isn't
that
the
totality
of
the
class
that
can
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty,
all
who
kill
with
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life?
