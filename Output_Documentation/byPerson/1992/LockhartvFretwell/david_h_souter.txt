justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
open
to
us
to
consider
that
collins
was
wrong
for
this
reason,
that
it
would
be
possible
under
the
arkansas
statute
to
commit
burglary
without
doing
so
for
pecuniary
gain,
and
that
therefore
the...
kind
of
the
basic
assumption
of
collins
was
wrong
in
the
first
place?
is
that
analysis
open
to
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
the
argument
was
that
pecuniary
gain
was
necessarily
the
motive
for
burglary
and
therefore
the
commission
of
a
crime
for
pecuniary
gain
did
not
narrow
the
class
of
burglars.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
should
have
said
robbery.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it...
so
that
you're
saying
it
would
not
be
possible
for
us
to
analyze
the
state
law
to
find
that
there
was
a
class
of
robbery
in
which
pecuniary
gain
was
not
the
motive?
what
i'm
thinking
of
is...
and
this
may
be
a
misstatement
of
state
law,
but
what
if
someone
had
committed
or
had
attempted
to
commit
theft,
and
on
learning
that
he
was
about
to
be
discovered
fled
and
used
force
in
fleeing?
as
i
understand
the
way
your
law
is
written,
the
robbery
would
have
occurred
at
the
point
at
which
he
used
force
to
escape,
and
his
motive
at
that
point
was
not
pecuniary
gain
but
to
escape.
would
it
be
open
to
us,
assuming
that's
correct,
to
say
that
on
that
view
of
the
law,
the
pecuniary
gain
aggravator
actually
did
narrow
the
class
of
robbers?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
under
certain
circumstances
it
can
narrow,
then
collins
was
wrong,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
under
certain
circumstances
the
pecuniary
gain
aggravator
can
narrow
the
class
of
robbers,
then
collins
was
wrongly
decided,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
skewed
if
it
narrows?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
i
thought
you
told
me
that
there
would
be
some
cases
in
which
there
would
not
be,
necessarily,
an
element
of
pecuniary
gain
in
a
robbery...
in
a
robbery
indictment.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
misunderstood
you,
i
guess.
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
medlock--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
strickland...
when
strickland
says
that,
isn't
strickland
addressing
the
standard
of
competence,
not
the
issue
of
prejudice?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
we've
got
to
judge
the
reasonable
competence
of
the
counsel
under
the
circumstances
at
the
time,
but
strickland
doesn't
hold,
does
it,
that
we
have
to
assess
prejudice
by
assuming
the
articulated
standards
of
the
time?
