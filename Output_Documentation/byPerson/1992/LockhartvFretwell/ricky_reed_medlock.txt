mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
noted
by
your
initial
question
to
the
attorney
general,
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
been
a
misstatement
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
his
formulation,
as
well
as
that
posited
by
ms.
waxman,
require
the
court
to
factor
into
the
analysis
of
fretwell's
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
subsequent
developments
in
the
law.
he
suggests
the
court
must
take
into
account
changes
in
the
law
which
took
place
some
4
years
after
fretwell's
trial
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
deprived
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
the
law
did
change,
justice
scalia,
in
that
the
rule
regarding
pecuniary
gain
was
changed,
and
our
point
here
is
that
even
though
we
need
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
subsequent
law
has
anything
to
do
with
it,
this
strickland
analysis,
it
does
in
a
sense
that
there
is
before
us
the
possibility
of
deciding
whether
or
not
lowenfield
applies
to
arkansas.
our
position
is
no,
lowenfield
does
not
apply
to
arkansas,
therefore,
the
change
which
occurred
was
wrong.
the
law
of
collins
was
always
good,
and
is.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
no,
sir.
if
i
understand
the
question,
that
pecuniary
gain
within
the
context
of
a
burglary
statute
is
not
the
same
thing
that
we
are
considering
in
our
capital
punishment
statute.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
it's
not
a
motive,
it's
that
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense
of
robbery.
pecuniary
gain
is
a
built-in
aggravator
in
every
case
of
capital--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--yes,
oh,
okay.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
that
it
actually
did.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
under
certain
circumstances,
it
in
fact
can
narrow,
i
think,
but
in
our
case--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--excuse
me.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
no,
sir.
under
some
theoretical
possibilities
that
might
happen,
but
under
the
realities
of
the
way
this
law
is
applied,
what
you
have
in
a
weighing
state
such
as
arkansas,
which
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment,
is
a
skewed
process
of
narrowing.
you...
with
our
definition
of--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--it
is
skewed
by
a
built-in
aggravator,
if
in
every
case
there's--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--i'm
not
sure
i'm
following.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
no,
sir.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
it
was
not
raised
and
there
was
no
pronouncement
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--that
i'm
aware
of,
no.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
that's
right.
we
don't
have
a
pronouncement
of
that.
what
the
petitioner
is
encouraging
us
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
adopt
a
new
rule.
if
we
limit
our
analysis,
if
we
focus
on
the
issue
that
really
is
before
this
court,
which
is
a
strickland
analysis
of
mr.
fretwell's
claim
of
ineffective
assistance,
we
can
answer
the
question.
we
need
not
go
further
and
consider
these
changes
in
the
law.
petitioner
asks
the
court
to
adopt
a
new
rule,
to
employ
the
use
of
hindsight
and
look
back
and
analyze
mr.
fretwell's
claim
in
light
of
these
subsequent
developments
in
the
law.
this
is,
as
i
said,
a
new
rule.
it's
in
direct
contravention
of
the
opinion
in
strickland,
where
it's
stated
that
every
effort
should
be
made
to
eliminate
the
distorting
effects
of
hindsight
when
assessing
claims
of
this
type.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
i
think
he
would
have
a
problem
making
that
argument
once
again
under
strickland.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
strickland's...
strickland
admonishes
us
against
considering
idiosyncracies
of
the
trier.
strickland
states
that
we
are
to
assess
these
claims
and
engage
in
the
assumption
that
the
trier
of
fact
is
reasonably
conscientiously
applying
the
law
and
not...
not
speculate
as
to
these,
so
i
think
you
would
have
problems
making
that
argument
under
those
facts.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
jurek
simply
doesn't
apply,
and
i
think
something
has
come
up
in
the
questioning
that
addresses
this.
we
need
to
engage
in
an
assessment
of
probability
here.
we
need
to
look
back
and
assess
things
from
counsel's
perspective
at
the
time
and
try
to
figure
out
what
would
have
happened
in
the
absence
of
the
ineffective
assistance.
if
the
trial
court
had
been...
let's
assume
counsel
for
the
defendant
had
made
the
appropriate
objection
and
had...
had
made
the
court
aware
of
the
decision
in
collins,
and
then
let's
assume,
as
the
state
would
suggest,
that
the
prosecutor
objected
to
that
and
presented
the
court
with
a
copy
of
jurek,
jurek
just...
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
jurek
does
not
apply
to
arkansas.
jurek,
first
of
all,
is
construing
texas
law,
and
not
only
is
it
from
texas,
but
it's
significantly
different
from
arkansas
law.
it's
intent
requirement
is
much
higher
than
arkansas'.
we
just
think
that
it's
preposterous
to
assume,
assessing
this
matter
from
a
standpoint
of
what
the
real
probabilities
are,
that
the
trial
court
would
have
looked
at
jurek
and
said
yes,
that
says
that
collins
is
wrong
and
that
we
can
ignore
the
eighth
circuit
and
we
can
here
at
the
trial
court
level
create
a
new
rule
in
contravention--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--i
think
that
the
new
rule
that
i'm
first
and
mainly
referring
to
here
is
one
under
the
prejudice
prong
of
strickland,
a
rule
which
permits
the
use
of
hindsight,
a
rule
which
allows
us
to
assess
prejudice
in
terms
of
what
happened
4
years
after
the
trial
or
10
years,
or
however
many
years.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
what--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--well,
it's
our
position
that
it
in
fact
was
not,
justice
o'connor.
it
was
not
wrong
at
the
time.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
nevertheless,
under
strickland...
under
the
admonitions
of
strickland,
assessment
of
these
claims
are
to
take
place
in
light
of
the
time
of
the
trial,
in
light
of,
or
analyzing
counsel's
conduct
at
that
time,
from
his
perspective.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
i
think--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--well,
i
think
that
when
it
speaks
to
that,
it
speaks
of...
out
of
concepts
of
fairness,
that
a
fair
assessment
of
this
claim,
a
fair
assessment
of
the
claim
in
its
totality
would
require
that
you
look
at
both
prongs
and
that
you
therefore
would
consider
it
in
that
light,
that...
it...
once
again,
what
mainly
stands
out
to
me
from
strickland
is
a
concept
of
fairness.
the
fundamental
fairness,
a
fair
assessment
of
any
sixth
amendment
claim,
requires
us
to
look
at
what
happened
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
that
things
changed
later,
that
the
law
developed
over
time
through
the
lowenfield
case
and
then
through
the
perry
case
should
not
be
held
to
relate
back
and
somehow
remove
the
taint
of
what
happened
at
that
time.
he...
mr.
fretwell
did
suffer
ineffective
assistance
in
the
terms
of
deficient
performance.
i
think
that's
conceded,
and
it
also
obviously
affected
the
outcome
of
his
trial.
if
an
objection
had
been
overruled...
addressing
the
assessment
of
probability
once
again,
if
the
appropriate
objection
that
we
say
counsel
should
have
been
made
pursuant
to
collins
had
been
overruled,
ultimately
fretwell
would
have
gotten
relief
anyway,
because
he
would
have
gone,
let's
say,
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
and
been
denied
relief,
and
under
post-conviction
relief
also
denied,
but
then
he
would
have
been
in
the
federal
system
and
he
would
have
gotten
relief
prior
to
lowenfield,
so
clearly
mr.
fretwell--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--well--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--well,
the
district
court
level,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
he
certainly
would
have
gotten
there
within
4
years
time.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
that's
right.
however,
he
certainly
would
have
gotten
it
at
the
eighth
circuit
at
that
time
as
well.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
that's
right.
i'm
just
addressing
the
assessment
of
probability
under
these
facts.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
you
need
something
in
addition.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
you
need
something
in
addition
to
that.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
there's
not
sufficient
narrowing
at
that
level.
if
you
simply
define
somebody
as
having
no
culpable
mental
state--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--no,
sir.
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
not
sufficient
narrowing.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
we
would
point
out
that
this
court
in
tison
established
a
minimal,
minimum
culpable
mens
rea
of
reckless
indifference.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
we
have
that.
that's
the
largest
possible
group
of
people--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--who
can
ever
get
death.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
from
that
group,
there
must
be
narrowed
those
who
are
actually
deserving
of
death.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
that's...
that
is
simply
insufficient
narrowing
under
existing
precedent,
justice
scalia.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
we'd
also
point
out
that
what
the
state
of
arkansas
says
about
it,
and
what
the
arkansas
legislature
and
decisions
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
interpreting
that
language
have
held.
they
don't
recognize
it
as
sufficiently
narrowing.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
using
stringer's
admonition,
i
think
we
should...
it
would
be
a
strange
rule
of
federalism
to
ignore
what
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
to
say
about
its
own
law.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
no--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--i
was
speaking
to
what
they
have
to
say
about
our
capital
felony
murder
statute
about
the
definition
of
a
culpable
mental
state
in
arkansas.
what
our
legislature
and
what
our
supreme
court
has
said
regarding
that.
it's
our
point
that
strickland
provides
all
the
guidance
that's
needed
for
analysis
of
fretwell's
claim.
it's
clear
if
you
apply
the
standards
governing
the
decision
at
the
time
of
fretwell's
trial
that
both
the
performance
and
prejudice
components
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
i
argued
to
them
that
to
resentence
him
since
the
law
has
changed
would
simply
gloss
over
or
ignore
the
deprivation
of
rights
he
had
sustained,
and
they
agreed
that
to
send
him
back
and
run
him
through
the
process
now
that
the
law
is
different,
now
that
the
law
is
the
converse
of
what
it
was
at
the
time--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--i'm
not
familiar
with
powers.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
the
perry
case.
well,
they...
i
think
at
that
point
in
time
they're
not
willing
to
say
that
they're
wrong
in
perry.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
that's
right.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
sir,
and
i
asked
them
to
do
that
in
the
alternative,
but
they're--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--i
think
that
they're,
as
chief
judge
lay
stated
at
that
time,
or
at
the
time
of
the
arguments,
this
situation
presented
a
conundrum,
and
what
happened
to
mr.
fretwell
at
the
time
of
the
trial
subjected
him
to
prejudice
which
couldn't
be
removed
any
other
way.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
the
respondent
also
urges
the
court
to
reject
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
arkansas'
capital
punishment
statute.
i
think
that
issue
is
before
the
court.
certainly,
it
is
our
position
that
it
should
be,
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
agrees.
arkansas'
statute
is
simply
unlike
louisiana's
or
texas.
it's
a...
does
not
perform
the
narrowing
function
at
the
guilt
phase--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--i
wouldn't
suggest
that
this
court
defer
to
an
erroneous
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
it's
our
position,
as
i
said,
that
under
the
rule
of
lowenfield
the
narrowing
function
must
be
performed
at
the
sentencing
phase
in
arkansas
through
findings
of
aggravating
circumstances,
and
those
circumstances,
in
order
to
provide
the
genuine,
meaningful
narrowing
required
under
the
eighth
amendment,
have
to
tell
the
jurors
in
arkansas
something
more
about
the
defendant
than
they
already
knew
at
the
close
of
the
guilt
phase,
something
which
would
serve
to
distinguish
him
as
somebody
deserving
of
the
death
penalty.
the
definition
of
the
offense
of
capital
felony
murder
in
arkansas
is
so
broad
that
it
brings
in
defendants
who
have
a
variety
of
mental
states,
as
well
as
some
who
manifest
no
culpable
mental
state
whatsoever.
it's
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
broader
class.
if
any
mental
state
is
described
in
arkansas,
and
it
can
be
argued
that
none
is,
it's
contained
in
the
language
which
states
that
the
crime
was
committed
under
circumstances
manifesting
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
this
language
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
a
defendant's
mental
state
may
have
been.
the
louisiana
statute,
on
the
other
hand,
as
well
as
texas,
described
culpable
mental
states
of
specific
intent
and
knowing
and
intentional
respectively.
it
should
be
noted
that
in
arkansas
the
trial
court
provides
no
definition
of
that
language.
under
the
arkansas
model
instructions
for
criminal
law,
there
is
no
instruction
which
defines
or
narrows
the
statutory
language
at
all.
the
court
should
also
note
that
the
same
statutory
language
in
arkansas
appears
in
our
definition
of
the
offense
of
first
degree
murder,
which
is
a
noncapital
offense.
if,
as
the
petitioner
argues,
that
language
is
sufficient
standing
alone
to
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
then
his
position
is
inconsistent
with
that
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
absent
something
further,
it
doesn't
rise
above
the
tison
threshold
is
our
position,
that
it's
just
not
sufficiently
narrow
to
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
at
that
stage.
something
more
must
be
learned.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
if
tison
specifies
reckless
indifference
and
that's
the
biggest
group,
regardless
of
the
accompanying--
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
--yes,
sir.
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
felony
murder
statute
with
that
specified
mental
state
does
not
rise
above
the
tison
threshold.
it's
the
same
thing.
it's
the
broadest
group
of
potentially
punishable
by
death
defendants
that
can
be
created.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
it
could
be.
however,
there
is
not
sufficient
additional
evidence
of
intent,
is
our
position,
of
any
of
those
enumerated
felonies
under
our
capital
felony
murder
statute
to
still
rise
to
the
level
that
sufficiently
narrows,
that
constitutionally
narrows.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes...
which
particular
ground
are
you
referring
to,
sir?
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
collins
was
correct.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
collins
has
continuing
validity.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
we're
not
going
that
far.
i
mean,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
the
continuing
validity
of
collins
is
not
essential
to
mr.
fretwell's
claim.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
yes,
we
do
reach
that
issue.
the
petitioner
has
agreed
that
that's
before
the
court,
and
we
wish
to
reach
it
as
well
and
suggest
that
the
court
should
look
at
this
and
rule
that
arkansas
is
not
a
lowenfield
class
1
state,
that
it's
in
the
second
group
in
lowenfield,
of
those
capital
punishment
statutes
which
must
narrow
through
the
finding
of
aggravating
circumstances
of
the
penalty
phase.
any
narrowing
which
occurs
in
arkansas
occurs
in
the
penalty
phase.
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
language,
that
evidences
the
arkansas
legislature's
intent
that
narrowing
occur
here
and
as
said
earlier
there
are
supreme
court
interpretations
of
the
statute
that
support
the
view
as
well.
the
legislature
made
clear
that
the
penalty
phase
is
all-important
in
arkansas,
not
superfluous
as
it
would
be
under
a
lowenfield
class
1
characterization,
by
setting
forth
three
separate
findings
which
must
be
made
within
the
penalty
phase.
a
person
first
of
all,
in
order
to
be
convicted,
must
be
found
to
have
committed
a
crime
with
aggravating
circumstances,
at
least
one
or
more
of
the
specified
aggravating
circumstances.
second,
the
jury
has
to
weigh
these
against
any
evidence
in
mitigation
and
thirdly...
must
weigh
these
and
find
that
they
outweigh
the
mitigation,
and
thirdly
the
jury
has
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
death
is
justified--

ricky
reed

--in
the
case.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
no,
sir.
i
think
it's
fine
if
it's
applied
correctly.
i
think
that
the
legislature
created
a
situation
as
just
stated,
that
if
the
narrowing
function
occurs
at
the
guilt
phase,
as
it
does
regularly,
then
the
statute
is
okay.
as
long
as
the
eighth
amendment
standards
have
been
met
as
far
as
narrowing
the
class
of
death-eligible
persons,
then
the
statute's
fine,
and
the
statute
provides
a
mechanism
for
that
at
the
penalty
phase.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
it's
not
that
there's
something
wrong
with
it,
it's
that
it
does
not
fit
into
that
first
group
of
statutes
under
lowenfield
which
narrowly
define
offenders
at
the...
within
the
definition
of
the
offense.
it's
obvious
that
the
legislature
did
not
deem
the
sentencing
phase
superfluous
in
arkansas.
these
findings
of
aggravating
circumstances
are
all-important,
and
they
went
further
than
that
an
added
in
the
weighing
and
justification
requirements.
as
pointed
out
by
justice
kennedy
in
stringer
v.
black,
the
difference
between
a
weighing
state
and
a
nonweighing
state
is
not
one
of
semantics
but
of
critical
importance.
the
fact
that
arkansas
is
a
weighing
state
gives
emphasis
to
the
requirement
that
aggravating
circumstances
be
defined
with
precision,
and
when
one
duplicates
an
element
of
the
underlying
offense,
it
simply
is
illusory
and
does
not
have
sufficient
precision.
stringer
states
that
a
vague
aggravating
circumstance
fails
to
channel
the
sentencer's
discretion,
and
when
used
in
the
weighing
process
is
in
a
sense
worse,
for
it
creates
the
risk
that
the
jury
will
treat
the
defendant
as
more
deserving
of
the
death
penalty
than
he
might
otherwise
be.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
in
this
case.
mr.
ricky
reed
medlock
well,
the
argument
i
made
to
them,
if
i'm
understanding
you,
is
as
stated
earlier...
either-or,
something
to
address
the
fact
that
he
was
deprived
and
was
prejudiced
by
this
deprivation
of
counsel.
thank
you.
