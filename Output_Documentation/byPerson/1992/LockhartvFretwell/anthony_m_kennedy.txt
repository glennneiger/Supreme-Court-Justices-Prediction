justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
could
assume
that
the
attorney,
say,
could
be
sued
in
a
professional
negligence
action
because...
if
we
assume
the
outcome
would
have
been
different,
and
that
he
did
not
know
about
the
collins
case
and
he
should
have
known
about
the
collins
case,
but
there's
still
no
constitutional
violation
because
the
trial
was
fair.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
a
little
odd
to
say
you
can
sue
for
professional
negligence
even
though
it's
a
fair
trial,
but
i
understand
the
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i'm
still
not
sure
what
the
standard
is,
whether
or
not
counsel
committed
a
constitutional
error--
