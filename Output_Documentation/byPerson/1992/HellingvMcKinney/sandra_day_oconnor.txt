justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
del
papa,
has
nevada
changed
its
regulations
since
the
institution
of
the
lawsuit,
concerning...
insofar
as
they
would
affect
placement
of
prisoners
for
smoking
or
nonsmoking
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
now
that's
embodied
in
written
policies--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
are
consistent
with
the
former
informal
policies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
particular
petitioner,
i
mean
plaintiff
in
the
suit
below,
has
been
moved
since
the
institution
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
he
presently
being
housed
in
a
single
cell?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there's
some
reason
to
think
that
he
may
be
moved
again
during
his
incarceration
and
again
subjected
to
secondary
smoke?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
another
question
while
i
have
you
interrupted.
to
impose
liability
on
the
state
here
or
the
prison
authorities,
i
suppose
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
the
prison
authority
is
deliberately
indifferent
to
any
condition
arising
from
secondary
smoke.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
that
issue
ever
addressed
in
the
courts
below,
deliberate
indifference--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
light
of
the
policy
of
the
prisons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
magistrate
found
no
deliberate
indifference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
that,
then,
reviewed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
was
the
finding
on
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
deliberate
indifference
finding,
was
that
ever
addressed
on
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
there
was
no
deliberate
indifference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
court
ever
addressed
the...
the
finding
that
there
was
no
deliberate
indifference.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
no
deliberate
indifference,
there
is
no
need
to
look
at
the
objective
question
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
need
to
address
the
objective
question
if...
if
it's
clear
that
there
was
no
deliberate
indifference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
roberts,
why
would
we
even
have
to
address
the
question
if
there's
no
deliberate
indifference
to
an
assumed
right
to
a
smoke-free
environment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
which
one
should
be
addressed
first,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
go
further
than
that
and
say
it
imposes...
secondary
smoke
imposes
a
serious
health
risk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel,
if
the
trial
court
were
to
look
at
the
current
adopted
and
articulated
policy
regarding
secondary
smoke
and
conclude
that
under
that
policy
there
could
be
no
deliberate
indifference,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
taking
testimony
from
an
expert,
would
there?
i
mean
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
because
you
have
to
meet
two
prongs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
i
thought
normally
we
tried
to
avoid
deciding
tough
constitutional
issues
if
there
was
some
other
factual
nonconstitutional
basis
for
deciding
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
states
have
enacted
antismoking
legislation
to
protect
in
the
workplace
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
might
be
some
indicator
of
public
standards
of
decency.
