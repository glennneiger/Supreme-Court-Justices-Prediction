chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-1958,
donald
l.
helling
v.
william
mckinney.
general
del
papa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
distinguish
that
from
the
case
that
we
have
before
us,
i
suppose,
in
that
one
could
certainly
argue
that
justice
kennedy's
hypothesis
poses
a
punishment
that
is
perhaps
not
only
cruel
but
unusual,
whereas
i
gather
one
of
your
points
is
that
this
is
not...
if
it's
a
punishment,
it's
nonetheless
not
an
unusual
punishment,
because
people
in
civil
society
outside
of
the
prison
are
exposed
to
pretty
much
the
same
thing
all
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the...
does
the
record
show
the
number
or
percentage
of
prisoners
in
this
particular
prisoner
who
smoked?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
del
papa.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
as
i
understand
it
this
case
was...
resulted
in
a
directed
verdict
by
the
magistrate
at
a...
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
following
up
on
justice
souter's...
anyway,
what
evidence
was
introduced,
if
any,
before
the
magistrate
as
to
the...
the
kind
of
things
we're
talking
about
right
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
plaintiff
offered
no
such
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
hitchcock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
took
place
in
october,
1989.
the
regulation
was
issued
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
litigating
about
what
happened
2
years
ago--
--and
this
sort
of...
this
sort
determination
that
you're
referring
to
is
not
made
by
us
on
the
basis
of
the
preference
of...
of
an
individual
party.
it's
based
on,
you
know,
theories
of
mootness
and
controversy
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
was
a
directed
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
conley
v.
gibson
bear
on
a
case
that
went
to
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
that
up
to
mr.
mckinney,
to
what...
what
issues
he
went
to
trial
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
a
decision
on
the
objective
component
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
aspect
of
this
case
would
probably
have
more
staying
power
and
significance
than
a
decision
on
the...
on
the
subjective.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
hitchcock.
general
del
papa,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
del
papa.
the
case
is
submitted.
