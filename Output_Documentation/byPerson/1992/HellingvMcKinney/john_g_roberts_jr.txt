chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
the
reason
is
that
exposure
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke
does
not
satisfy
the
objective
component
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
the
ninth
circuit
below
framed
the
issue
as
whether
such
exposure
posed
an
reasonable
risk
of
harm;
that
is
not
the
eighth
amendment
standard.
what
this
court
has
asked
in
its
condition
of
confinement
cases
is,
instead,
whether
there
has
been
a,
quote,
serious
deprivation
of
basic
human
needs
or
a
denial
of
the,
quote,
minimal
civilized
measure
of
life's
necessities,
end
quote.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
smoke-free
cell
is
not
a
basic
human
need.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
under
the
eighth
amendment
looks
to
society's
standards.
and
in
society--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--society
does
not
have
an
understanding
that
a
smoke-free
environment,
the
toxin
of
second-hand
smoke,
to
use...
in
your
phraseology,
is
a
basic
human
need.
at
the
very
least
what
is
condemned
as
cruel
and
unusual
in
prisons--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
a
legal
question
that
each
court
presented
with
it
along
the
way
has
an
obligation
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
this
court
addressed
a
similar
question
in
gregg
v.
georgia,
or
in
coker
v.
georgia,
where
it
looked
to
societal
standards
reflected
in
legislative
enactments
to
determine
what
society's
standards
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
we...
if
we
are
at
the
cutting
edge,
it
seems
to
me
then
the
answer
is
clear.
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
that
prisons
be
in
the
vanguard
of
a
movement
toward
a
public
health
ideal.
they
follow
contemporary
standards
of
decency,
to
use
the
formulation
quoted
most
recently
in
hudson
v.
mcmillian.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
not
have
to
address
it.
there
is
both
an
objective
component
and
a
subjective
component;
failure
on
either
one
means
there's
no
eighth
amendment
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
natural
priority
in
addressing
them
here.
what
the
ninth
circuit
based
its
decision
on
was
the
objective
component.
it
said
the
objective
component
may
be
satisfied
if
there's
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm.
that's
the
issue
before
the
court
today,
and
that's
where
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
erred.
it
erred
because
society
does
not
unambiguously
condemn
exposure
to
secondhand
tobacco
smoke
in
the
way
it
must
before--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
assuming
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
the
question
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
the
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
does
not.
it
is
not
the
standard
this
court
has
articulated.
and
the
reason
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
i
understood
the
hypothetical,
he
said
everyone
was
getting
sick.
that
is
an
existing
medical
need;
under
estelle
v.
gamble
it
must
be
addressed
by
the
prison
authorities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
depend...
it
would
depend
on
what
society's
standards
were
with
respect
to
that
risk.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
it
would
state
an
eighth
amendment
claim.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if...
yes.
if
it's...
if
you're
telling
me
that
there's
toxic
water
that
is
going
to
make
everyone
sick
within
the
next
30
days,
yes.
as
a
society--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
smoke,
because
there's
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
difference
is
that
as
a
society
we
don't
accept
or
tolerate
the
notion
that
everyone
will
drink
water
that's
going
to
make
people
sick
within
30
days.
we
do
accept
and
tolerate
the
condition
that
people
are
exposed
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
asbestos--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
that
may
well
state
a
eighth
amendment
violate,
because
we,
as
a
society,
don't
treat
exposure
to
asbestos
as
a
matter
of
personal
preference.
when
we
go
to
a
restaurant
they
don't
ask
do
you
want
the
asbestos
section
or
the
nonasbestos
section.
[laughter]
they
do
ask
do
you
want
smoking
or
nonsmoking.
smoking
is
a
matter
of
personal
preference,
and
exposure
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke
also
a
matter
of
personal
preference.
and
the
first
thing
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--exactly.
and
it's
not
entirely
up
to
our
preferences--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
our
society
it's
not
entirely
up
to
personal
preferences
to
move
away
either.
osha
estimates
that
77
percent
of
nonsmoking
americans
are
exposed
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke
at
work.
many
americans
are
exposed
involuntarily
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke
at
home.
if
a
parent
smokes
and
exposes
children
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke,
we
don't
brand
that
as
child
abuse.
it's
difficult
to
imagine
how
what
we
allow
parents
to
do
to
children
in
the
home
is
somehow
cruel
and
unusual
when
done
to
a
convicted
felon
in
prison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
inmate's
complaint
was
not
framed
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
framed
it,
the
evidence
at
the
trial
concerned
his
existing
medical
needs
and
the...
and
the
evidence
the
state
would
have
submitted
concerned
the
steps
they
had
taken
to
accommodate
that.
there
was
not
evidence
about
the
general
public
health
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
plaintiff
had
pamphlets
from
various
organizations
that
he
wanted
to
admit
into
evidence,
and
that
was
not
admitted
by
the
magistrate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
issue
under
the
eighth
amendment
is
not
the
state
of
medical
knowledge
or
a
public
health
ideal.
the
fact
that
the
surgeon
general
tells
us
that
exposure
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke
is
harmful
does
not
dispose
of
the
eighth
amendment
issue.
the
issue
is
societal
standards
and,
for
better
or
for
worse,
we
as
a
society
do
not
always
follow
the
surgeon
general's
guidance
about
what
is
most
healthful.
the
surgeon
general
tells
us
we
eat
too
much
red
meat
and
too
many
eggs
and
that
that
increases
our
risk
of
heart
disease,
but
we
still
do
it.
and
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
exposure
to
secondary
tobacco
smoke.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
can
be
disposed
of
in...
on
that
basis.
if
you
compare
the
prisoner's
complaint,
the
pretrial
stipulation,
with
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
you'll
think
you've
seen
two
different
cases.
because
the
prisoner's
complaint
was
urging
either
a
completely
smoke-free
environment
and
failure
to
address
his
serious
medical
needs,
and
he
lost
on
both
counts.
the
ninth
circuit
reshaped
the
complaint
to
state
a
very
different
claim
and
then
proceeded
to
decide
that
different
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
the
ninth
circuit's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
ninth
circuit
judgment,
which
we
think
should
be
reversed--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
prisoner
is
completely
subject
to
being
moved
to
a
smoking
cell,
having
a
smoker
moved
into
his...
into
his
cell.
the
standard--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
our
position
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
its
articulation
of
the
standard
under
the
eighth
amendment--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
that
should
be
reversed.
the
standard
is,
as
reiterated
last
year
in
hudson
v.
mcmillian,
contemporary
standards
of
decency.
contemporary
means
two
things.
one,
it
means
we're
not
bound
by
what
was
barbarous
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
eighth
amendment
was
drafted,
but
it
also
means
we're
not
bound
by
the
public
health
ideal
of
the
future
to
which
we
may
or
may
not
be
moving.
under
the
surgeon
general's
guidance
and
the
guidance
of
epa,
they
say
we
should
change
how
we
treat
secondary
tobacco
smoke.
that
means
we're
not
there
yet,
and
if
we're
not
there
yet--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
and
it
does,
and
they
say
society
should
change
how
it
treats
that.
that
means
that
it
cannot
be
cruel
and
unusual
because
society's
standards
tolerate
it.
that's
the
problem
the
surgeon
general
and
epa
have
identified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
was
not
raised,
and
i
think
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
that
basis,
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far
in
liberally
construing
the
complaint.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
in
the...
the
state's
papers
did
suggest
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far
in
construing
what
the
issue
was
in
the
complaint.
thank
you,
your
honor.
