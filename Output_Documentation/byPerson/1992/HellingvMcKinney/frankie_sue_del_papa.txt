mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
nation's
prisons
are
dangerous
places.
we
take
our
most
troubled
and
troublesome
citizens,
we
put
them
behind
walls
for
our
protection
and
their
rehabilitation.
we
do
so
in
structures
and
under
rules
designed
for
security,
ours
and
theirs,
then
we
ask
those
who
manage
them
to
somehow
make
it
work.
it
is
a
difficult,
complex
job;
one
in
which
the
most
routine
daily
decisions
can
have
serious,
even
lethal
consequences.
it
is
in
recognition
of
those
consequences
that
35
states,
the
united
states
district
of
columbia,
puerto
rico,
and
three
territories,
ask
you
to
reverse
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
is
not
only
in
direct
conflict
with
opinions
of
other
circuit
courts,
but
severely
impacts
the
serious
decisions
confronting
the
men
and
women
who
run
our
nation's
over
1,300
prisons.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
murder
and
is
serving
his
sentence
in
the
nevada
prison
system.
in
1987
he
filed
a
civil
rights
complaint
alleging
he
had
shared
a
cell
with
a
series
of
inmates
who
were
heavy
smokers
and
that
prison
officials
had
done
nothing
to
separate
smoking
and
nonsmoking
inmates.
he
also
alleged
certain
medical
symptoms
as
a
result
of
exposure
to
secondary
cigarette
smoke,
and
that
the
exposure
constituted
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
he
sought
an
injunction
prohibiting
prison
administrators
from
housing
him
with
inmates
who
smoke
and
asked
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
that
complaint
launched
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today.
the
question
is
whether,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
held,
the
respondent
has
stated
a
valid
eighth
amendment
claim.
even--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--no,
justice
o'connor.
the...
the...
what
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
this
initial
complaint
was
an
informal
policy
of
accommodation
in
terms
of
whenever
practical.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
that's
correct.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
that's
correct.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
that's
correct.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
the
underlying
facts
are
capable
of
repetition,
yes.
because
at
any
time...
of
course,
classifications
are
reviewed
through
administrative
regulations
at
least
every
6
months.
but,
again,
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
transfers.
because
he
is
in
a
single
cell
now
does
not
mean
that
he
will
always
have
a
single
cell.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
the--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--well,
the
informal
policy,
of
course,
was
in
place
at
the
time.
and
the
magistrate
specifically
found
no
serious
medical
need
nor
deliberate
indifference.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
the
finding
on
review...
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
distinguish
between
a
serious
medical
need
of
a
present
condition
and
a
future
condition.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
well--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--the
court
of
appeals
on...
wanted
to
remand
this
case
because
of
the...
the
way
that...
well,
they
first,
of
course,
found
that
they
disagreed
with...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
well...
and
we
would
argue
that,
yes,
they
did
review
the
deliberate
indifference
because
they
did
find
no
abuse
of
discretion
on...
on
the
part
of
the
magistrate.
however,
it's
complicated
by
the
fact
that
she
had
found
no
constitutional
right
to
a
smoke-free
environment,
where
they
had
found
a
different
claim
here.
and...
and
it
is
our
contention--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--no.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
there
were
symptoms,
justice
white,
that--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
well,
we
would
argue
that
the...
the
exposure
to
the
environmental
tobacco
smoke
in
the
first
instance
does
not
meet
with
the
objective
component.
and,
of
course,
i
realize
you
can
take
these
and
there's
no
set
way
in
taking
these.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
that's
a
very
fair
description.
first
let
us
say
that
we
share
concern
that
exposure
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke
is
a
potential
health
hazard.
we
fully
recognize
and
appreciate
the
epa's
recent
report
giving
ets
class-a
status
as
an
environmental
hazard.
but
we
do
not
agree
that
exposure
to
it
rises
to
the
level
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
giving
it
that
status
has
considerable
consequences.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
no.
at
worst
it
lays
the
groundwork
for
a
constitutional
burden
impossible
for
prison
authorities
to
carry
out,
recognizing
the
realities
of
our
nation's
prison
system.
at
best
it
is
an
unwarranted
and
unwise
constraint
on
the
discretion
of
our
prison
administrators,
who
must
daily
balance
health
and
security
concerns
in
the
management
of
these
complex
and
inherently
dangerous
institutions.
society
continues
to
debate
the
relative
rights
of
smokers
and
nonsmokers,
and
the
health
concerns
relating
to
the
use
of
tobacco.
even
as
that
process
continues
to
unfold,
the
ninth
circuit
has
mistakenly
determined
that
the
debate
is
over,
and
it
has
provided
a
constitutional
right
for
prisoners
establishing
a
health
standard
which
our
nation's
legislatures
have
so
far
expressly
rejected,
a
goal
that
those
of
us
on
this
side
of
those
prison
walls
do
not--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--well,
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done,
i
would
contend,
is
that
they
have
recognized
a
different
standard
than
what
this
court's
standard
is
for
eighth
amendment
violations
by...
they
framed
the
question
below
in
terms
of
whether
such...
such
exposure
posed
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm,
but
that's
not
the...
the
standard
that
this
court
applies
to
eight
amendment
violations.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
we
take
the
position
that,
again,
because
there
is
an
accommodation
policy
and
because
smoking
is
of
a
secondary
concern...
smoking
is
considered
to
be
a
personal
preference.
there
are
other
concerns
that
the
warden
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
first
before
reaching
and
trying
to
accommodate
the...
the
smoking
preference.
such
things
as--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--not--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--not
under
the
constitution.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
that,
of
course,
would
be
in
violation
of
nevada
law.
it
would
be
considered
retaliation.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
no.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
the
problem
with
what
you
have
stated,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
portion
of
that.
because
it's...
it's
very
difficult
to
determine,
and
certainly
i
would
agree
that
if
you
had
a
constitutional
right
and...
and
then
you
had...
and
thereby
completing
the
objective
component
of
the
wilson
v.
seiter
test,
and
then
you
showed
deliberate
indifference,
then,
yes,
you
would
have...
that's
where
you
would
have
the
problem.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
well
i--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
correct
legal
standard,
because
this
court's
standard,
in
terms
of
conditions
of
confinement
cases
such
as
rhodes
v.
chapman,
is
instead
inhumane
conditions.
i
think
that
you
would
first
have
to
consider
whether
or
not
this
is
a...
a
serious
deprivation
of
life's
minimal
necessities,
and
then
you
would
reach
the
question
of
what
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and,
of
course,
all
of
that
ties
back
to
the
question
of
what
are
society's
standards.
in...
today
in
the
society
that
we
live
in,
smoking
is
accepted.
all
of
us
are
exposed
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
well,
the
standard
that
i
believe
should
apply
is
this
court's
standard
with
reference
to
eighth
amendment
cases,
and
not
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
standard
that
the
ninth
circuit
attempted
to
apply
in
the
original
case.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
no.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
it
has
been
agreed
that
anywhere
between
two-thirds
and
90
percent
of
inmates
smoke.
which,
of
course...
the
majority
of
inmates
in
our
prison
systems
in
our
country
smoke.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
yes.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
i
would
think
that,
again...
and
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
the
clearest
and
most
reliable
objective
factor
with
risk
is,
of
course,
our
legislative
enactments.
i
think
you
would
look
first
to
those
as
the
factors
as
to
what
society's
standards
are.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
i
would
say
no,
because
i
think
that
the
standard
of
decency
relative
to
exposure
of
environmental
tobacco
smoke
in
our
country
has
not
evolved.
the
debate
is
continuing.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
if...
if
you
have
serious
existing
medical
needs--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--which
we
did
not
have
in
this
instance.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
if...
yes,
if
you...
if
you
have
deliberate
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
that's
correct.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
no,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
justice
white,
in
response
to
your
question
to
mr.
roberts,
we
did
note
in
our
petition
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
the
way
that
it
framed
the
issue
at
pages
25-29
of
our--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--i
have
just
a
couple
of
brief
points.
we
alerted
the
court
to
our
policy
and
the
fact
that
it
had
changed,
not
that
it
was
written,
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
petition
stage.
we
would
contend--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--i
don't
believe
there
was
an
opportunity.
and,
again,
we
would
contend--
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
--but
it
was...
i
think,
due
to
the
timing
and
the
way
the...
the
policy
actually,
your
honor,
came
out
before
the
magistrate
actually...
the
policy
came
out
before
trial.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
we're
contending
that
the...
that
the
policy
has
not
materially
changed,
particularly
with...
with
reference
to
the
accommodations.
mr.
frankie
sue
del
papa
i
don't
agree
with
that.
