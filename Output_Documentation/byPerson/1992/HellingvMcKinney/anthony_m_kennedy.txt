justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
agree
that
deliberate
indifference
to
an
unreasonable
risk
of
serious
harm
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
just
want
to
make
sure
we
are
agreed
on
the
standard.
you
do
agree,
then,
that
deliberate
indifference
to
an
unreasonable
risk
of
serious
harm
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
correct
legal
standard
for
us
to
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
can...
we
can
argue
about
what
is
or
is
not
a
serious
risk
of...
of
harm.
but
i'm...
i'm
simply
wondering
about
your
standard
that
you're
applying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
an
inmate
has
a...
has
a
long
history
of
violent
assaultive
behavior
on
his
cellmates.
and
suppose
we
assume
that
it's
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
to
put
another
cell...
another
prisoner
in
with
him.
now,
would
deliberate
indifference
to
that
risk
constitute
an
eighth
amendment
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
those
pamphlets,
as
i
understand
it,
had
to
do
with
smoking
by...
the
dangers...
dangers
to
the
health
of
the
smoker--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
not
to
second...
were
not
addressed
to
secondary
smoking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
should
we
decide
this
case
simply
on
the
basis
that
the
prisoner
attempted
to
make
out
a
serious
risk
to
his
own
health
and
that
he
did
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
by
your
asking
us
to
address
that
issue,
insisting,
almost,
that
we
do,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
endorsing
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
treated
the
pleadings
in
this
case
and
the
proof
in
this
case,
and
i
had
thought
there
was
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
even
raised?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
do
those
regulations
meet
constitutional
requirements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
question...
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
we
can
say
that
if...
if
there's
a
particular
risk
of
serious
danger,
we
can
nonetheless
tolerate
it
because
it's...
because
society
as
a
whole
does.
