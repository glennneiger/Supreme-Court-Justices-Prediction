justice
david
h.
souter
general,
in...
with
respect
to
the
articulation
of
the
standard,
you
have
said
that
unreasonable
risk
is
not
the
appropriate
way
to...
to
state
it.
but
however
it
may
be
stated,
whether
it
be
stated
in
terms
of
unreasonable
risk
or
an
unreasonable
deprivation
of
life's
necessities,
what
is
or
is
not
reasonable
is
ultimately,
is
it
not,
a
function
to
be
determined
under
the
concept
of
evolving
decency?
is
that
fair
to
say,
under
our
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
who
should
make
that
determination
in
the
first
instance?
should
we
make
it?
should
a
district
court
make
it,
a
court
of
appeal
make
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're...
they're
something
to
look
at,
but
my
question
is
who
should
look
at
it?
because,
for
example,
we...
we
may
indeed
look
at
legislative
enactments
and
i
suppose...
i
haven't
done
it,
but
i...
i
assume
we
will
find
legislation
about
smoke-free
zones
in
public
buildings
and
so
on.
but
in
each
of
those
instances
the
legislature
is
dealing
with
people
who,
by
and
large,
have
some
voluntary
control
as
to
whether
or
not
they
will
or
will
not
be
in
the
smoke-free
zone.
so
that
the
legislation
is
not,
in
effect,
going
to
answer
our
question;
it's
just
going
to
be
part
of
the
record
on
which
the
question
should
be
answered.
and...
and
i
go
back
to
the
question,
who
should,
in
effect,
compile
that
record
and
where
should
it
be
compiled?
are
we
in
a
position
to
make
that
judgment
right
here
and
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
nontoxic
air
a
basic
human
need?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
my
phraseology,
nontoxic
air?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's...
before
we
get
to
society's
standards...
well,
maybe
you
are.
you're
saying
society
does
or
does
not
have
an
understanding
that
nontoxic
air
is
one
of
basic...
life's
basic
needs?
justice
david
h.
souter
who...
who
should
make
the
determination...
that
kind
of
mixed
determination
of
fact
and
value
that
you
just
stated?
should
we
make
it
in
the
first
instance
or
should
a
district
court
at
least
take
a
stab
at
it
based
on
a
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
one
that...
is
it
one
that
can
be
decided
without
a
factual
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
we
weren't
dealing
there
with
an
issue
which
was
sort
of
on
the
cutting
edge
of
what
society
does
or
does
not
tolerate,
whereas
we
are
doing
that
here,
aren't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
didn't...
i
was
just
going
to
say
you
didn't
urge
review
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
really
a
procedural
case,
that
the
ninth
circuit
shouldn't
have
reached
the
issue
of
the
standard,
given
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
had
not
either
raised
an
allegation
or
offered
evidence
that
would
make
it
appropriate
to
develop
the
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
