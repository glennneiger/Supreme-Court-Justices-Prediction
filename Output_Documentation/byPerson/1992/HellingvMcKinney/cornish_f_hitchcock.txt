mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
the
question
presented
on
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
to
respond
to
the
questions
from
the
court
about
the
present
nature
of
the
controversy,
particularly
some
of
the
opening
questions
from
justice
o'connor.
2
years
ago
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
mr.
mckinney
is
entitled
to
seek
an
injunction
regarding
the
conditions
of
his
confinement
at
the
nevada
state
prison
in
carson
city.
shortly
after
that,
as
the
questioning
indicated,
he
was
moved
to
a
new
facility
where
he
has
been
located
for
the
last
2
years,
or
assigned
for
the
last
2
years.
second,
he
no
longer
shares
a
6
foot
by
8
foot
cell
with
somebody
who
smokes
five
packs
of
cigarettes
a
day,
which
amounts
to
one
cigarette
every
10
minutes
during
every
waking
hour.
and
third,
there
is
a
new
written
policy
that
is
far
more
explicit
than
the
informal
practice
cited
before.
and
i'd
like
to
respond
more
specifically
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
i
think
it
is
not
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
the
new
written
policy...
which,
by
the
way,
took
effect
prior
to
trial
in
this
case,
although
we
were
not
told
that
until
the
reply
brief
stage
in
this
case...
is
a
little
more
explicit.
the
informal
policy
previously
in
question
is
cited
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
22,
paragraph
4,
the
affidavit
of
donald
helling,
who
was
the
classification
officer
at
the
time.
now,
this
affidavit
was
not
part
of
the
record
at
trial.
it
was
submitted
in
connection
with
the
preliminary
injunction
papers.
mr.
helling
was
planning
to
testify,
as
i
understand
it,
but
he
did
not,
in
fact,
testify.
and
this
was
not
before
the
magistrate
who
heard
the
case
with
consent
of
the
parties
when
she
directed
the
verdict.
and
if
one
looks
at
the
paragraph
in
question,
it
does
not
mention
smoking
as
such.
what
it
talks
about
is
considering
various
factors,
including
the
personal
desires
of
the
inmate,
quote
unquote,
which
are
taken
into
account,
insofar
as
practical,
in
deciding
who
rooms
with
whom.
now,
the
policy
in
question
that
took
effect...
well,
let...
to
go
chronologically,
the
pretrial
stipulation
under
which
this
case
was
presented
to
the
trial
court
and
to
the
court
of
appeals
states...
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
51
of
the
joint
appendix.
paragraph
8
at
the
top
of
the
page
states
as
a
stipulation
signed
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
of
nevada,
who
was
handling
the
case,
and
i
quote:
there
are
no
restrictions
on
smoking
in
the
prison's
housing
units,
classroom
or
library.
no
restrictions
in
the
housing
units.
the
official
policy
which
was
adopted
subsequently,
and
which
we
first
learned
about
when
the
solicitor
general
filed
his
brief,
indicates
three
factors
that
i
think
are
relevant
here
to
the
question
of
whether...
of
the
state
of
the
present
controversy.
first
of
all,
smoking
by
inmates
is
now
prohibited
throughout
the
nevada
state
prison
system
during
meetings,
counselling
sessions,
or
visits
with
a
doctor.
secondly,
no-smoking
areas
are
explicitly
created
in
common
areas
such
as
classrooms,
libraries,
the
gym,
chapels,
dining
areas,
and
the
infirmary.
and
third,
with
respect
to
housing
questions
nevada
prison
officials
are
now
required
expressly
to
make,
and
i
quote,
reasonable
efforts,
unquote,
to
accommodate
nonsmokers
and
smokers
alike.
and
if
a
nonsmoker
such
as
mr.
mckinney
has
to
be
double
celled
and
if
he
asks
for
a
nonsmoking
cellmates,
the
rules
require,
and
i
quote,
accommodations
will
be
made
as
necessary
consistent
with
security
considerations
and
space
availability,
unquote.
so
this...
this
is
the
rule
that's
now
in
effect,
and
has
been
since
1989.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
we
and
the
solicitor
general
assumed
that
this
was
a
1992
policy,
but
as
the
state
points
out
in
its
reply
brief,
in
fact
it
took
place
on
october
1st,
1989.
the
relevant
copies,
which
change
only
minor...
in
minor
details
from
year
to
year,
have
been
lodged
with
the
clerk
and--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--the
regulation
was
issued
on
september
28th,
1989.
and
it
states
effective
october
1,
1989,
smoking
will
be
regulated
as
follows.
that...
that's
in
the
additional
materials
that
were
lodged.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
in
our
view,
if
those
standards
are
followed
in
the
prison
system,
and
i...
we
submit
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
prisoner
to
challenge
the
conditions
of
confinement
to
satisfy
the
subjective
prong
if
the
prison
official
is
saying
we're
doing
all
that
we
can
consistent
with
the
considerations,
with
balancing
of
the
interests.
then
i
think
under
wilson
v.
seiter
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
prisoner
to
say
you
are
being
deliberately
indifferent,
you
are
not
demonstrating
the
requisite
subjective
intent
that
it
needed
for
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
there
would
be
no
basis
for
an
injunction
under
that
situation.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well...
well,
there's
no
question...
but
let
me...
let
me
answer
the
question
a
little
more
specifically,
if
i
may,
justice
white.
you
are
correct
that
there
is
no
question
as
to
damages
here.
the
ninth
circuit
held...
affirmed
a
denial
of
damages.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think...
and
let
me
emphasize
this
point
because
it
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
question
as
well
as
your
own.
if
the
policy
is
in
effect
and
if
it
is
being
implemented,
if
it's
being
followed,
then
i
think
the
prisoner
would
have
a
difficult
situation.
if
the
complaint
is,
yes,
there's
this
policy,
but
they're
ignoring
it,
they're
not
celling
me...
there's
three
cells
down
there
where
they
could
give
me
a
cellmate
and
they're
not
doing
it,
or
they're
not
having
no-smoking
areas,
then
i
think
the
question
of
subjective
culpability
would
still
be
an
open
issue.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it
depends.
if...
if
the
crowding
situation
is
as
bad
as
the
state
is
suggesting,
then
perhaps
a
prisoner
will
not
be
able
to
make
the
claim.
i
think--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes.
and
in
this
case
mr.
mckinney's
concern
has,
in
fact,
been
accommodated.
it
might
affect
a
number
of
prisoners,
as,
for
example,
the
drinking
water
case
justice
white
posited.
i'd
like
also
to
respond
to
the
question
about--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--yes.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
think
that
would
be
a
sensible
resolution.
i
mean,
for
example,
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question
what
about
the
conditions
at
this
prison.
the
lawsuit
in
question
challenges
conditions
at
a
prison
to
which
he
is
no
longer
assigned,
and
where
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record.
so
i...
i
think,
as
some
of
the
questions
by
justice
souter
were
asking,
the
question
really
in
this
case
is
who
should
decide,
in
the
first
instance,
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
what
the
facts
are--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--yes,
sir.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
counsel
should.
let
me
explain
the
situation
there.
mr.
mckinney
has
obtained
the
services
of
an
attorney
out
in
nevada
who
will
represent
him
in
proceedings
on
remand
in
this
case.
as
appellate
counsel
in
this
case,
i
have
been
unable
to
try
to
determine
exactly
what
the
conditions
are
he's
presently
complaining
of.
his
concern
at
the
present
time
is
with
conditions
at
the
ealey
state
prison
where
he
is
presently
housed
more
so
than
the
conditions
back
at
the
former
prison
where
he's
only
returned
for
several
weeks.
i
think,
as
cases
like
lewis
v.
continental
bank
and
the
differdorfer
case
suggest,
when
there's
been
a
material
change
of
the
sort
that's
involved
here,
the
appropriate
resolution
is
to
let
the
trial
court
sort
things
out
in
light
of
the
developments.
i
mean,
for
example,
if
we
had
known--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
that
is
correct.
but
the
problem
is...
is
as
appellate
counsel
2,000
miles
away,
i
am
unable
to
do
the
sort
of
factual
and
legal
research
that
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
frame
either
a
new
complaint
or
an
amended
complaint
that
would
take
account
of
the
fact
that
there
is
this
policy
that
has
taken
effect,
as
well
as
the
fact
he's
no
longer
at
the
prison
that
he
filed
suit
from.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
that...
that
is
correct.
the
court
could
simply
dismiss
it.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
that...
that's
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
we're
dealing
here,
really
though,
is
a
situation
where
there
was
a
development,
a
factual
development,
which,
had
we
known
about
it
before
the...
before
the
petition
had
been
granted,
we
might
have
been
able
to
address
and
the
court
might
have
decided
to
see
how
the
issue
plays
out
in
light
of
wilson
v.
seiter.
this
is
the
first
opportunity,
frankly,
we've
had
to
raise
that
question,
which
is
why
i'm
doing
it
at
the
time.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
my
client
is
unwilling
to
concede
mootness
or
to
give
up
the
injunction.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
cannot,
from
washington,
d.c.,
do
the
type
of
investigation.
i
think
that...
that
it
would
be
needed
to
say
precisely--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it
may
be
moot,
it
may
not
be
moot.
i
cannot
stand
before
the
court
and
say
that
if
i
had
to
draft
a
new
complaint
about
the
conditions
at
ealey,
this
is
what
i
would
say.
i
think...
the
case
has
gone
on
for
6
years
now.
the
state
knew
about
the
change
in
this
case
between
the
time
of
the
stipulation
and
between
the
time
of
trial.
it
chose
not
to
tell
anybody
that
there
was
now
a
written
policy
that
deals
with
this
until
we
got
to
the
reply
brief
stage.
and
under
the
circumstances,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
you
could
simply
say
we're
going
to
dismiss
and
let
mr.
mckinney
bring
a
new
case,
if
he
chooses
to
do
so.
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
though,
the
magistrate
being
familiar
with
it
and
whatnot,
it
might
be
the
preferable
disposition,
as
in
lewis
v.
continental
bank,
to
simply
send
it
back
and
say,
okay,
is
there
still...
let
the
trial
court,
who
can
take
facts,
figure
out
what's
left
of
the
case
in
the
light
of--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--or...
or
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
remand
to
the
trial
court.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
i
think,
did
in
its
second
opinion.
what
the
court
of
appeals...
when
the
court...
this
court
remanded
for
consideration
in
light
of
wilson,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
all
right,
wilson
adds
an...
well,
adds
or
clarifies
an
element
that
has
to
be
proven,
and
we're
going
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
since
the
case
is
at
the
pleading
stage--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--yes.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
we
advised
the
court
of
appeals
the
second
time
around
that
he
had
been
transferred
and
had
a
no-smoking
cellmate.
the...
the
state
did
not
advise
the
court
of
appeals.
ironically,
the
latest
version
was
adopted
the
same
day
as
the
supplemental
briefs
in
this
case.
they
did
not
tell
them,
by
the
way
we
have
a
new
written
policy
in
this
case
that
you
might
want
to
tell
the
trial
court
to
consider
in
addition.
i'd
like
to...
to
pick
up
another
question
justice
o'connor
asked
before
about
the
finding
of
a
deliberate
indifference.
it
is
certainly
correct
that,
as
the
trial
court
viewed
the
issue,
there
are
two
questions.
one,
deliberate
indifference
to
existing
conditions
and
two,
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
of
the
broader
sort
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
quite
explicitly,
and
this
is
at
pages...
see
38
and
39
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
there
was
no
deliberate
indifference
as
to
the
present
conditions
in
which
mr.
mckinney
was
being
confined.
but
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
trial
as
to
the
future
conditions,
the
finding
of
deliberate
indifference
does
not
extend
to
the
second
claim.
and
i
would
point
out,
as
we
noted
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
the
united
states
and
all
the
state
amici
agree
with
us,
that
the
subjective
element
which
underlies
deliberate
indifference
did
not
come
into
play
here.
what
the
magistrate...
the
way
the
magistrate
viewed
the
case...
and
this,
again,
is
at
pages
41
and
42
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
the
summary...
was
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
it
was
not
appropriate
to
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
state
because,
in
her
view,
the
question
was
whether...
was
to
what
extent
is
mr.
mckinney
currently
suffering
from
some
illness.
in
her
view
prior
to
wilson,
eighth
amendment
violations
turned
on
the
seriousness
of
the
particular
complaint.
and
when
at
trial,
she
concluded,
based
on
the
evidence,
that
there
was
nothing
presently
wrong
with
him
that
was
not
being
treated,
she
made
the
finding
of
deliberate
indifference
and
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he
did
not
have
a
broader
claim.
in
our
view,
that
the
correct
analogy--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it
was
a
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--yes.
and
if
i
can
respond
to
the
earlier
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that...
that
mr.
roberts
raised,
the
question
was
well
what
did
mr.
mckinney
put
on.
most
of
the
exhibits
dealt
with
complaints
that
he
had
filed.
i
would
point
out
also
that
mr.
mckinney,
prior
to
trial,
made
a
motion
to
have
the
appointment
of
an
expert
toxicologist
to
talk
about
precisely
these
issues.
that
motion,
which
was
denied
by
the
magistrate
prior
to
trial
but
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
should
not
have
been
denied,
asked
for
a...
an
expert
to
testify
on
such
issues
as,
and
i'm
quoting...
well,
what
he
said
was
without
the
testimony
of
an
environmental
toxicologist,
plaintiff
cannot
prove
the
effect
of
smoker's
side-stream
smoke
upon
a
nonsmoker.
he
said
that
he
had
been
in
touch
with
a
toxicologist
at
the
local
university
but
could
not
pay
him,
and
asked
would
you
appoint
someone.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
magistrate
erred
under
rule
706
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
denying
that
request,
and
said
that
when
the
case
is
remanded
for
trial
the
court...
the
trial
court
should
seriously
consider
appointing
such
an
environmental...
environmental
toxicologist.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
yes.
the
case
may
well
be
decided
on
summary
judgment
based
on
the
subjective
prong.
the
question
that
is
presented
in
this
case
however,
the
only
issue
that
the
state
brought
up,
is
the
question
of
whether
the
objective
prong
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation
can
be
stated
based
upon
the
exposure
to
tobacco
smoke
that
may
cause
a
serious
injury
down
the
road.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
that
is
correct,
and
that's
why
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
the
policy
in
question
here,
if
it
had
been
brought
up
at
the
petition
stage,
we
could
have
talked
about
it
and
suggested
that
the
best
resolution
would
have
been
either
to
deny
certiorari
and
let
the
case
go
back,
either
in
the
judgment
or
affirm...
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
remaining
unaffected,
or
with
instructions
to
consider
this
element
as
well.
but
we
didn't
know
until
the
merit
stage
that
there
had
been
an
explicit
policy
in
question.
and
i
think--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--yes,
sir.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
my
answer--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
my
answer
to
that,
i
think,
will
depend
in
turn
upon
the
evolving
standards.
as
we...
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
fact
that,
as
of
the
time
we
wrote
it,
epa
and...
epa
was
in
the
process
of
adopting
a
report
which
was
finally
released
last
week,
which,
in
fact,
classifies
environmental
tobacco
smoke
not
as
some
annoyance
to
which
everybody
is
subjected
at
some
time
in
his
or
her
life,
or
part
of
what's
called
in
the
scientific
parlance,
background
smoke--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
no.
if...
if
you
examine
the
methodology
the
epa
has...
and
we
cited
the
sources...
what
they
do
is
they
look
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
there
is
a...
a
series
of
scientific
papers,
scientific
studies,
which
conclusively
show
that
epa
should,
in
fact...
that
environmental
tobacco
smoke
is,
in
fact,
a
group
a
carcinogen
of
the
same
order
as
arsenic,
asbestos,
benzene,
coke
oven
emissions--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--and
simpler
considerations--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--no.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
if
i
could
give
a
factual
answer,
one
of
the
striking
things
about
the
epa's
study,
although
it's
not
gone
into
detail,
is
that
the
part
of
the
population
most
susceptible
to
serious
injuries
are,
in
fact,
children.
conditions
such
as
asthma
and
other
conditions,
which
may
not
have
been
suspected
not
terribly
long
ago,
are,
in
fact,
conditions
that...
which
children
can,
in
fact,
obtain
serious
illnesses
far
beyond
the
magnitude
of
the
3,000
excess
lung
cancer
deaths
a
year.
so
the
way
i
would
answer
it
is
let's
look
at
asbestos.
a
number
of
years
ago
one
would
not
have
thought
it
was
child
abuse
to
put
children
in
schoolrooms
with
asbestos.
one
might
not
have
thought...
one
would
have
thought
building
one's
home
with
asbestos
was
perfectly
benign.
i
think
the
question
here...
the
only
question
presented
on
the
merits
is
whether
or
not
a
cause
of
action
is
stated
based
on
an
objective
condition
and
whether,
under
conley
v.
gibson,
one
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there's
no
set
of
facts
that
could
be
proven
which
would
entitle
mr.
mckinney
to
relief.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
because
it
went
to
trial
on
the
separate
question
of
whether
mr.
mckinney
is
suffering
a
present
injury.
and
let
me--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--it
was
up
to
trial,
but...
but
the...
the
second
claim
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
turned
upon
his
ability
to
produce
some
kind
of
evidence
as
to
the
long-term
exposure,
and
i
believe
he
protected
his
right
by
filing
not
one
but
two
motions
to
have
expert
testimony,
which
was
denied,
in
which
the
magistrate...
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
he's
entitled
to.
i
think
the
distinction,
in
response
to
your
question
and
other
questions
from
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that...
a
distinction
between
a
case
such
as
hutto
v.
finney.
if
a
prisoner...
which
involved
the
punitive
isolation
from
other
prisoners.
if
a
prisoner
complained
on
the
first
day
of
that
kind
of
punitive
isolation
and
a
doctor
said
i've
looked
at
this
person,
there's
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
him,
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
say
that
there
was
deliberate
indifference
to
a
current
condition.
similarly...
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
condition
involved
his
exposure
after
a
month
or
several
weeks
or
a
year,
that
might
be
a
situation
where
there
was
an
injury.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
hutto,
situations
that
are
tolerable
for
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
may
be,
in
the
court's
phraseology,
intolerably
cruel
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
as
a
matter
of
law
to
guide
the
lower
courts.
but
let
me
talk
also
more
specifically
about
that,
because
i
think
analytically
the
question
of
whether
exposure
to
environmental
tobacco
smoke
can,
at
some
level,
rise
to
an
objective
eighth
amendment
violation
really
has
two
subclass...
subparts
to
it.
the
first
is
whether,
at
a
general
level
or
as
a
general
proposition,
exposure
to
a
hazard
which
does
not
manifest
itself
immediately
but
is...
poses
an
unreasonable
risk
of
a
serious
harm
at
some
future
point
is
covered
by
the
eighth
amendment.
that's
the
position
that
the
state
takes
in
this
case,
although
the
solicitor
general,
at
least,
does
not
go
that
far.
and
let
me
give
an
example
of
what
accepting
that
argument
would
mean,
and
then
i
will
suggest
that
this
court
has
not
gone
that
far
in
its
opinions.
under
the
state's
formulation
in
this
case,
let
us
suppose
that
prisoners
in
a
prison
system
were
given
shots
using
the
same
needle.
they
had
to
share
a
needle,
a
flu
shot
or
whatever.
and
let's
suppose
that
some
of
the
inmates
sharing
that
needle
were
hiv
positive
and
let's
suppose
that
that
would
have
the
effect
of
exposing
some
unexposed
prisoners
to
be
getting
the
aids
virus
and
dying
a
rather
slow
and
painful
death
somewhere
down
the
road.
under
that
scenario
the
state
posits
that
that
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
expose
people
to
that
risk,
that
the
eighth
amendment
only
applies
if
death
or
serious
injury
is...
is
instantaneous
or
imminent,
and
it
does
not
cover
those
types
of
situations
down
the
road.
i
think
that
argument
is
foreclosed,
at
least
implicitly,
by
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
hutto
v.
finney
and
rhodes
v.
chapman,
particularly
rhodes
where
the
court
cited
with
approval
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions
which
also
involved
threats
of...
of
imminent
danger
where
it
was
not
clear
that
somebody
would
be...
would
be
injured.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
there's--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
there's...
there's
a
factual
distinction
too,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
the
exposure
of
children
in
the
home
to
smoke
during
the
hours
the
parents
and
children
are
together
during
the
day
is...
is
qualitatively
different
than
the
situation
complained
of
here,
which
is
confinement
in
a
6
foot
by
8
foot
cell
with
somebody
who
is
lighting
a
cigarette
in
close
proximity
once
every
10
minutes
of
every
hour
during
every
waking
hour
during
the
day.
and
even
if
one
would
not
consider
that
to
be...
well,
i
don't
know
what
one
might
say
if
that
was
the
way
the
children
were
being
raised
and
that
was
the
situation
they
were
exposed
to
7
days
a
week
in
a
small
room
with
a
parent
without
the
adequate
ventilation.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
again,
i
think
the
question
is...
i
think
one
can
find
an
answer
to
that
by
looking
to
the
severity
of
the
risk
here,
where
you
have
the
risk
at
this
level
for
a
period
of
time,
and
i
just
don't...
i
don't
think
if,
also,
one
looks
at
the
way
society
treats
smoking,
at
least
with
respect
to
adults
in
a
number
of
situations,
that
that
is
the
level
of
exposure.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
the
question
is
at
what
level,
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
question.
in
this
context
the...
there
are
evolving
standards
in
this
direction.
if
i...
if
one
looks
at
cases
like
enman
v.
florida,
coker,
thompson,
other
cases
where
the
court
has
instructed
to
look
to
legislation,
there
is
an
impressive
amount
of
legislation
that,
in
fact,
restricts
smoking
beyond
the
levels
at
which
this
case
was
tried.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
there
are...
45
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
enacted
restrictions
in
some
fashion
at
some
level.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
and...
and
i
would
go
one
step
further,
justice
o'connor.
according
to
the...
an
article
in
the
1991
journal
of
the
american
medical
association,
a
number
of
other
municipalities
with
populations
of
over
25,000
have
adopted
their
own
ordinances,
primarily
in
those
states
where
there's
no
law
or
the
law
is
very
weak.
and--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
regardless--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
i'm...
i'm
not
aware
of
the
legislative
history
behind
the
ordinances,
but
i
can
say
they
do
have
the
prohibitions
and
restrictions--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
they
do--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
there
is
a
consensus,
i
think,
if
one
looks
at
the
statute.
and
to
finish
up
on
justice
o'connor's
inquiry,
the...
the
jama
article
that
we
cited
indicates
that
by
mid-1989,
and
i'm
quoting
now,
nearly
all
urban
americans
were
covered
by
a
state
or
local
smoking
restriction.
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
because
i
think
there
may
be
another
distinction
to
separate
this
case
from
the
child
abuse
case.
the
problems
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
i
think,
are
more
serious
than
those
that
have
identified
with
children.
the
epa
pointed
to
lung
cancer,
an
extremely
serious,
often
fatal
situation.
the
other
situation
which
is
frequently
found
is
death
by
heart
disease.
we're
talking
about
risks
of
death
here
that
are
far
higher
than
have
been
recognized
in
many
other
situations.
administrator
reilly
stated
on
wednesday
that
the
risk
of
death
from
lung
cancer
is
at
about
1
in
1,000
for
people
who
have
never
smoked.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
it...
it
would
depend
at
what
level
it
was
being
served.
if
you
had
the
kind
of--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--if...
yes.
if
you
had
a
level,
a
risk
of
1
in
1,000,
which
is
the
risk
of
death
by
lung
cancer
or
heart
disease,
my
answer
would
be
yes.
and
to
put
that
in
context,
1
in
1,000
doesn't
sound
like
much,
but
it
is
a
level
which
this
court,
in
the
benzene
case,
said
entitles
osha
to
regulate
risks
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
significant,
and
osha
has,
in
fact,
regulated
product...
exposure
in
the
workplace
to
products
such
as
formaldehyde
or
ethylene
oxide.
and
it
is
well
above
the
tolerance
level
that
epa
and
the
fda
use
in
their
own
regulation
of
other
cancerous
materials.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
osha
standards
do
not
apply
in
prison,
but
in
terms
of...
of
the
risk
that
they
would--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--well,
there...
there's
at
least
one
case
i'm
aware
of,
justice
stevens,
a
court
of
appeals
decision
which
involved
exposure
to
pesticides.
and
it
was
held
that
there
was
cruel...
there
was
an
eight
amendment
violation
stated
if
prison
inmates
were
out
working
in
the
fields
under...
with
exposure
to
pesticides
that
was
not
comparable
to
those
of
private
employees
with
the
same
standard.
so
it...
it
may
be,
but
in
this
case
if
we're
comparing
risks
and
comparing...
i'm
putting
it
in
context...
epa
and
fda
will
regulate
risks
if
the
chance
of
death
from
lung
cancer
is
as
low
as
1
in
100,000
or
1
in
a
million.
also,
the
other
serious
injury,
you
know,
which
again
has
not
been
identified
with
child
abuse,
is
death
by
lung
cancer.
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
has
indicated
that
the
chance
of
death
is
as
high
as
1
in
100,
based
on
exposure
to
cigarette
smoke
among
people
who
never
smoke.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
ask
the
charge
be
affirmed.
