justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
point
is
that
the
deliberate
indifference
finding
of
the
magistrate
was
connected
with
the...
with
the
substantive
finding
that
there's
no...
that
there's
no
problem
so
long
as
you
don't
have
current
symptoms.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
don't
have
a
right
to...
so
you
can't
really
say
that
the
rest
of
the
case
goes
away
by
reason
of
the
deliberate
indifference
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but...
but
the
problem
is
if...
if
this
case
comes
to
us
with
the
finding
that,
in
fact,
the
state
was
not
indifference...
was
not
indifferent
to
this...
to
this
prisoner's
desire
to
have
a
nonsmoking
roommate
and
was
not
indifference
to
his...
was
not
indifferent
deliberately
to
his
desire
to...
to
have
clean
air,
entirely
clean,
free
of
cigarette
smoke,
then,
as
justice
o'connor
says,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
other
issue.
but
i
did
not
understand
the
magistrate
to
have
said
oh,
the
state
was
very...
very
concerned
about
this
prisoner's
right
to
clean
air.
i
thought
the
magistrate
said
he
has
no
right
to
clean
air.
now,
he
has
a
right,
if
he
has
symptoms,
to
be
given
some
consideration,
but
they
did
that.
they
were
not
deliberately
indifferent
to
that.
now,
is
that
a
fair
description
of
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
think
that
that's
likely.
you
don't
think
that
the
prison's
objections
to
this
whole
notion
is...
is
based
upon
the
fact
that,
of
course,
you're
going
to
have
claims
of
that
sort.
if
the
whole
thing
rests
upon
whether
you're
doing
your
best,
they're
going
to
say
well,
gee,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
you
could
have
celled
me
with
instead.
that'll
always
be
an
available
claim,
won't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
a
lawsuit
all
the
time,
and
at
least
in
our
cases
you
have
to
have
a
prisoner
who...
who,
you
know,
is...
has
been
beat
up
or
who...
who
is...
is
physically
very
ill.
but
under...
under
this
rule
any
prisoner
can...
can
say,
gee,
i...
you
know,
i
want
a
new
roommate.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
very
often
want
new
roommates
for
quite
other
reasons,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
are...
are
you
saying
the
case
is
moot?
are
you
acknowledging
the
case
is
moot?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
you
don't
know
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hitchcock.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
to
talk
for
a
minute
about
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
would
you...
what
is
your
response
to
mr.
roberts
assertion
that
it...
it
would
seem
extraordinary
to
say
that
it's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
simply
to
expose
someone
to
secondary
cigarette
smoke
when
we
don't
even
consider
it
child
abuse--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
parents
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
epa
is
sort
of
on
the
cutting
edge
in
these
things,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
establishes
the
risk
and
the
danger,
just
as
you
can
establish
the
risk
and
the
danger
from
eating
too
many
fatty
foods.
but
people
haven't
stopped
eating
fatting
foods,
and
i...
and
i
presume
we
don't
have
to
feed
people
in
prisons
bean
sprouts
simply
because
that
would
be
healthier.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
risk
that
we
all
know
about
and
that
this
society
has
accepted.
i
mean
maybe
it's
intelligent,
maybe
it's
unintelligent,
but
this
society
has
accepted
it.
now,
why
isn't
the
case...
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
whatever
the
ep
says...
epa
says
about
the
medical
fact,
this
society
has
accepted
this
risk,
as
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
it
is
not...
you
have
no
cause
of
action
for
child
abuse
simply
because
you
raise
your
child
in
a...
in
a
nonsmoke-free
environment.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
again,
i...
you
know,
i
expect
any
doctor
who...
who
used
needles
that
way
would
be
subject
to...
to
a
lawsuit
under...
under
current
standards.
and
i
assume
any
parent
who...
who
used
the
same
needle
for
a
series
of
injections
to
various
children
would
be
subject
to
some...
some
legal
sanction
for
that
kind
of
action.
but,
once
again,
i
think
if
the
doctor
has
a...
does
not
have
a
nonsmoking
waiting
room
or
if
the
parents
smoke
despite
the
fact
that
they
have
children,
we
do
not
consider
that
contrary
to
current
standards.
it
may
indeed
be
dangerous,
but
there
are
some
dangers
our
society
has
not
said
is
too
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
should,
but
it
hasn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
parents
with
children
in...
small
children
in
small
rooms.
i
don't
know
of
a
single
lawsuit
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
we
don't
know
whether
those
statutes
are
based
on
the
fact
that
they
think
the
risk
of
death
is
so
overwhelming,
or
just
people
don't
like
the
smell
of
the
doggone
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
those
laws
may
well
be
based
on
that.
we
can't
say
it's
that
society's
made
the
judgment
that...
that
the
risk
of
death
is
intolerable.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sure
they
will
all
make
health
noises,
but
one
doesn't
know
that
that's
the...
people
do
not
like
the
smell
of
cigarette
smoke.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
don't
like
it
when
they're
eating
and
they
don't
like
it
any
place
they
are.
i
don't
know
why
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the...
a
consensus
in
society
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
health
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
we
found
the
same
risk...
the
same
risk,
the
same
degree
that
you
find
from
secondary
tobacco
smoke,
with
respect
to
fatty
foods,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
to
serve
hamburgers
and
sausages
in
state
prisons?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
level
that
produces
the
same
risk
that
you're
concerned
about
from
tobacco.
