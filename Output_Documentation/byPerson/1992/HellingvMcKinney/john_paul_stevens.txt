justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
the
deliberate
indifference
go
to
two
different
issues?
one,
whether
he
had
a
medical
condition
that
had
not
been
adequately
taken
care
of.
and
secondly,
whether
they
were
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
whole
smoking
policy.
weren't
they
separate
in
that
magistrate...
before
the
magistrate,
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
well,
didn't
the
magistrate
find
that
there
was
really
no
problem
unless
the
prisoner
had
some
symptoms,
some
active
symptoms
of...
that
would
require
medical
treatment?
that
just
a
latent
threat,
as
yet
unrealized,
just
wouldn't
state
a
cause
of
action.
and
on
that
basis
they
found
no
deliberate...
no...
no
indifference
because
there
weren't
any
symptoms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
really
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals?
as
i
understood
it,
they
remanded
and
now
there're
two
issues
to
be
decided
in
the
district
court
proceedings.
one,
whether
objectively
the
harm
is
sufficient
and
secondly,
the
deliberate
indifference
problem.
have
they
really
decided
that...
that
the
plaintiff
will
win
on
remand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
warden,
if
he
wanted
to,
could
deliberately
impose
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
to
a
nonsmoker
by
putting
him
in
a
cell
where
he
knew
there
would
be
a
serious
risk
of...
of
harm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
warden
could
deliberately
house
a
person
with
a
smoker
knowing
that
that
person
would...
would
have
a
very
serious
risk
of
harm
from
the
smoking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
have
any
duty
at
all,
under
the
constitution,
to
accommodate
a
smoking
concern
that
the
plaintiff...
the
prisoner
alleges
is
going
to
cause
serious
harm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
hasn't
yet
materialized.
it's
latent
and
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
duty
whatsoever.
and
the
second
question,
could
he
deliberately
house
an
inmate
with
a
smoker
as
a
punitive
measure;
say
you've
been
misbehaving,
i
think
i
know
a
way...
that
i'll
straighten
you
out
for
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
it
violate
the
federal
constitution,
though,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
about
justice
white's
hypothetical
about
the
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the...
if
the
allegation
were
there's
an
unreasonable
risk
that
everybody
will
get
sick
in
the
next
30
days,
that
would
not
be.
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
like
to
drink
nontoxic
water
and
they
like
to
breathe
nontoxic
air,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wait,
it
would
state
an
eighth
amendment
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
toxic
smoke.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
what's...
that's
the
one
that's
before
us,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
kind
of
a
pleading
case,
and
whether
the
ninth
circuit,
in
effect,
has
reshaped
the
complaint
into
a
cause...
an
actionable
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
may
i...
may
i
ask
a
question
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
shouldn't
counsel
for
the...
you,
i
guess
you,
decide
whether
you've
got
a
lawsuit
that's
worth
pursuing
at
this
point
in
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we're
not
in
the
habit
of
announcing
constitutional
rules
in
cases
that
may
be
totally
hypothetical
and
speculative
and
nobody
really
intends
to
go
to
trial
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
the
case
were
simply
dismissed
at
this
point,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
anything
that
would
prevent
him
from
bringing
a
new
lawsuit
saying
where
he
now
is
he
doesn't
like
the
situation
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
not
know
either
about
the
changed
regulation
or
about
his
transfer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
really
don't
contend
that
osha
standards
apply
in
prison,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
even
they...
it
wouldn't
have
to
have
even
the
same
degree,
or
do
you
think
that
there
should
be
the
same
degree
of
risk
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
didn't
you
tell
the
ninth
circuit
about
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
policy
change
was
in
1989,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
stipulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
must
agree,
i
think,
that
the
written
policy
is
inconsistent
with
certain
parts
of
the
stipulation.
