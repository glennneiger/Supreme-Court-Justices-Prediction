justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
but,
anyway,
whatever
the
symptoms
were,
they
weren't...
he
found
that
they
were
not
deliberately
indifferent.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
agree
that
deliberate
indifference
to
the
obvious
medical
needs
of
the
prisoner
is
a...
is
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and,
now,
there's
an
allegation
in
this
case...
this
is
a
pleading
case,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
an
allegation
that...
that...
that
housing
someone,
a
nonsmoker
with
a
smoker,
poses
a
serious
medical
risk,
and
that
the
authorities
are
deliberately
indifferent
to
it.
why
doesn't
that
state
a
cause
of
action?
it
doesn't.
that's
just
an
allegation
and
i...
don't
know
whether
it
could
be
supported
or
not.
but
why
doesn't
that
state
of
cause
of
action
under
the
eighth
amendment,
just
like
a
complaint
alleges
the
water
is
dirty
in
this
prison,
it's
giving
every...
making
everybody
sick,
and
they're
completely
indifferent
to
this.
that
would...
wouldn't
that
state
an
eighth
amendment
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if...
even
if...
even
assuming
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you
have
to
really
face
up
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's...
the
case
comes
to
us,
exposure
to
this
kind
of
smoke
poses
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
to
a
person's
health.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
but
that
just
doesn't
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
asbestos--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
a
prison?
the
allegation
says
that
this
prison
is
loaded
with
asbestos.
it's
a
serious
medical
risk.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
in
the...
it
isn't
in
the
prison
a
matter
of
personal
preference.
they...
you...
the
prisoner
goes
where
he's
put.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
say
you
want
smoking
or
nonsmoking
in
the
prison.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
have
a
live
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
that
was
never
suggested
to
us
at
the
certiorari
stage.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
would
be
no
basis
for
injunction
currently.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
no
question
about
damages
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i...
could
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--could
i...
why
wouldn't
it
that...
why,
if
this
new
regulation
is
a...
is
to
be
taken
seriously,
i
would
suppose
we
might
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
new
regulation
in
terms
of
whether
there's
anything
left
of
the
lawsuit
as
far
as
an
injunction
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't...
you
perhaps
don't
consent
to...
you...
you
may
be...
not
be
in
any
position
to
consent
to...
to...
or
to
urge
us
to
do
that,
but
i
suppose
we
could...
but
you
did
say
it
might
be...
from
our
point
of
view
it
might
be
a
sensible
thing
to
do
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not
let
the
court
of
appeals
decide
what
to
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but,
yeah...
but
we're
going
to
ask
them
to
reconsider
it
in
the
light
of
the...
of
the
changed
regulations.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you
very
much.
