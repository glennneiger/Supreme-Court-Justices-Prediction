could
i...
could
i
ask
you...
suppose
we
disagree
with
you...
suppose
we...
suppose
we
say
that...
that
there
is
no
need
for
notice
or
comment;
is
the
case
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you
that...
that
there
is...
that
that
is
not
committed
to
agency
discretion,
but
that
there's
no
need,
when
the
agency
did
what
it
did,
for...
to
give
notice
or
comment.
justice

r.
white
to
decide
whether
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
court
didn't
reach
that,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand,
if
we...
if
we
say
that
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion,
there
is
no
need
to
reach
the
notice
and
comment
issue,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
if...
if
it's
a
rule.
we
would
have
to...
we
would
have
to
agree
that
it's
a
rule
before
there's
notice
and
comment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
have
to...
well,
go
ahead.
mr.
jasperse,
just
a
couple
of
questions.
this
involves
a
termination,
but
let's
assume
that
the
agency
simply
reduced
the
number
of
employees,
would
that
be
a
rule?
