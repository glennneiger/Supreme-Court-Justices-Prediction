mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
a
1985
decision
by
the
indian
health
service
to
redirect
the
work
of
a
group
of
its
employees
from
a
regional
to
a
national
effort
to
promote
the
availability
of
diagnostic
and
related
services
for
handicapped
indian
children.
the
employees'
work
was
funded
by
a
lump
sum
appropriation
from
congress
for
the
indian
health
service
and
its
12,000
employees,
50
hospitals,
150
health
centers,
and
300
health
clinics.
the
funds
were
authorized
by
the
snyder
act,
the
comprehensive
statute
that
authorizes
indian
appropriations
generally,
and
by
the
indian
health
services
improvement
act
which
from
time
to
time
has
provided
supplemental
funds
to
address
specific
areas
of
congress'
concern.
this
case
presents
two
questions.
first,
whether
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
of
the...
of
an
agency's
allocation
of
funds
from
one
concededly
authorized
purpose
to
another
is
barred
because
it
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
and
second,
whether
formal
rule-making
procedures,
consisting
of
a
published
notice
in
the
federal
register
and
opportunity
for
comment,
is
required
before
the
indian
health
service
could
redirect
its
resources
in
the
manner
that
respondents
challenge.
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
no,
or
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
on
both
questions.
on
the
first,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
snyder
act
and
the
indian
health
service
act
do
not
provide
manageable
standards
for
a
court
to
apply
in
reviewing
the
indian
health
service's
action
here.
nor
does
the
lump
sum
appropriations
statute
furnish
any
such
law.
it's
simply,
as
is
typical
of
such
statutes,
a
lump
sum
for
all
of
the
authorized
activities
of
the
statutes...
or
of
the
agency
under
the
statutes
that
authorize
its
basic
functions.
the
court
of
appeals
instead
concluded
that
certain
statements
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
lump
sum
appropriations
statute
furnished
a
basis
for
judicial
review.
in
our
view
that
is
clearly
wrong.
statements
in
legislative
history
are
simply
not
law
for
a
court
to
apply
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
apa
jurisprudence.
only
statutory
texts
enacted
by
congress
is
law
for
a
court
to
apply.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
language
in
this
case.
it
did
not
focus
on
language
in
the
lump
sum
appropriations
statute
itself
and
then
say
that
the
legislative
history
helped
to
clarify
the
statutory
text.
the
court
really
used
the
legislative
history
as
a
substitute
for
the
statutory
text.
the
statutory
text
here
simply
authorizes
the
agency
to
expend
the
funds
for
purposes
authorized
by
the...
by
the
snyder
act
as...
those
functions
transferred
to
the
indian
health
service.
it's
then
necessary
to
look
to
the
snyder
act
or
the
indian
health...
indian
health
statute
to
look
for
any
law
to
apply.
and
the...
the
snyder
act,
for
example,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
again,
didn't
find
anything
in
the
text
of
the...
of
the
snyder
act
or
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
that
would
furnish
law
to
apply
in
this
case.
the
snyder
act,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
morton
v.
ruiz,
is
deliberately
comprehensive.
it
was
enacted
in
response
to
the...
the
time
when
points
of
order
were
raised
against
indian
appropriations
because
there
was
no
authorizing
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
if...
if
the
claim
were
that
the...
that
the
indian
health
service
were...
were--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--exactly.
but
there...
i
don't
there
can
be
any
question
here
that
the
reallocation
or
redirection
of
the
work
that
the
indian
health
service
made
in
this
case
was
authorized
by
the
statute.
it
simply
redirected
the
employees'
work
from
a
regional...
regionally
focused
program
to
a
national
program,
to
assure
available
services
for
indian
children.
there's...
i
think
that's
unquestionably
within
the
broad
language
of
the...
of
the
snyder
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i...
i
think
not.
respondents
have
not
contended
that
the...
that
the...
use...
utilizing
the
employees...
what
was
going
to
be
done
here,
essentially...
let
me
just
back
up
for
a
minute.
the
employees
under
this
indian
children's
program
in...
or
project
in...
in
the
southwest
was
really
set
up
as
a
pilot
project.
it
wasn't
even
integrated
into
the
local
indian
health
care
delivery
system.
it
was
operated
out
of
headquarters
as
a
pilot
project
to
really
investigate
what...
what
might
be
done
in
what
was
thought
to
be
perhaps
an
under
utilized
area.
but
the...
but
the
ultimate
point
was
to
develop
data
and
approaches
for
a
nationwide
program.
and
so
when...
when
the
indian
health
service
redirected
the
activities
of
the
employees,
the
thought
was
that
rather
than
have
these
employees
do
monthly
consultations...
consultative
visits
with
individual
children,
it
would
be
better
to
try
to
develop
local
responsibility
for
the
indian
children
from
local
programs
and
have
these
employees
use
their
expertise
to
go
to
other
indian
health
service
areas
around
the
country
to
help
them
develop
the
local
expertise.
but
i
don't
think
there's...
there
can
be
any
question
and
i
don't
understand
respondents'
to
claim
that
the
utilization
of
the
employees
for
this
nationwide
effort
is
somehow
beyond
the...
the
scope
of
what
the
snyder
act
or
the
indian
health
care
act
would
authorize.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well
in...
in
state--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
there
were
specific
statutory
requirements
that
had
to
be
satisfied,
and
there
wasn't...
there
was
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in...
in
the
state
farm
case
there
were...
there
were
actually
quite
stringent
requirements
that
the
agency
had
to
satisfy
before
it
could
promulgate
a
motor
vehicles
standards.
there
was...
there
were
certain
criteria
at
certain
levels
of
safety
that
had
to
be
satisfied
that
gave...
that
gave
a
court
law
to
apply.
here
the...
again,
the
snyder
act
was
intended
to
cover
essentially
every
possible
activity
that
the
bia
and
now
the
indian
health
service
might
engage
in,
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
a
point
of
order
when
funds
were
appropriated
to
cover
those
funds.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
might
be
taken
into--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
might
be
taken
into
account
in
construing
the
term
harmful,
i
guess
is
the
statutory...
the
operative
word
there.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the...
the
snyder
act,
for
example,
broadly
appropriates
funds
for
the
benefit...
directs
the
bia
to...
to
supervise
the
expenditure
of
funds
that
congress
may
from
time
to
time
appropriate
for
the
benefit,
care,
and
assistance
of
indians
throughout
the
united
states
for
a
variety
of
services,
as
relevant
here
"relief
of
distress"
and
"conservation
of
indians".
now,
again,
if
the
claim
here
were
this
is
not...
this
money
is
not
being
spent
for
the
relief
of
distress
or
conservation
of
the
health
of
indians
or
for
any
of
the
other
purposes
in
the
act,
that
would
be
law
to
be
apply.
but
our
point
is
that
in...
in
choosing
among
the
concededly
authorized
purposes,
there's
no...
there
is
no
law
to
apply
in
the
text
or
legislative
history
of
the
snyder
act
or
the
indian
health
care
improvements
act
that
would
help
a
court
to
decide
that
question.
now--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
can
imagine
that
sort
of
legislative
history,
but
i
think
in
some
respects
that's
very
much
like
the
american
hospital
association
case
this
court
had
several
terms
back
where
there...
where
there
was
legislative
history
about
the...
the
expectations.
and
the
way
the
court
thought
the
national
labor
relations
board--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not...
not
unless--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
unless
that
legislative
history
is
tied
to
something
in
statutory
texts
that
mandates
that
result.
i
think
this
is
very
much
like
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
the
uaw
case
versus
donovan
of
some
years
back,
where
the...
the
court
pointed
out
that
legislative
history
of...
of
expectations
in
the
way
that
congress
expected
that
expected
that
funds
may
be
expend
are
simply
expectations,
they
aren't
legally
binding
requirements.
that's
not
to
say
they
don't
furnish
protections,
because
congressional
oversight
in
the
appropriations
process
is...
is
often
a
very
useful
one.
and,
in
fact,
it's
in
many
respects
the
most
productive
and...
and
appropriate
one
for
the
overseeing
of
broad
legislative
programs.
courts
are
not
generally
suited
to
determining...
to
second-guessing
an
agency's
ordering
of
its
priorities
on
spending.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
unless
congress
has...
unless
congress
has
provided
further
guidance
about
how
the
court
is
to
order
its
priorities.
it's
instructive
in
this
regard--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
not
unless
it's
tied
to
specific
statutory
texts.
the
expectations
are
ones
that
congress
might
enforce,
as
it
were,
in
oversight
hearings
in
subsequent
years,
which
is
the
tradition
give
and
take
between
an
agency
and
its...
and
its
authorizing
and
appropriations
committee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is...
it
is
unreviewable,
yes.
because...
first
of
all,
i
think...
there
are
reasons,
i
think,
why
that's
not
apt
to
become
a
major
problem,
but
let
me
explain
why
that's
so.
the
availability
of
other
services
is
simply
one
of
the
many
criteria
that
the...
in
this
case
the
indian
health
service
might
take
into
account
in
reallocating
resources.
it...
it's
also
possible
that
there
would
be
some...
that
there
would
be
other
uses
of
the
funds
that
would
simply...
as...
as
needed
as
the
funds
might
seem
for
one
service,
might
seem
more
useful
for
another
service.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
indian--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
that
reason
is
wrong--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
that
reason...
if
that
reason
proves
to
be
wrong,
i
think
what
would
happen
is
that
would
be
brought
to
the...
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
indian
health
service
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there's
not...
there's
not
law
to...
because
even
if
there's
a
factual
error,
that
does
not
mean
there's
law
to
apply.
the
agent...
the...
this
is...
our
position
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that...
that
would
be
the
sort
of
claim
that
would
be
made
if
it
were
arbitrary
and
capricious--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
our
position
is
that
review
would
be
precluded
of
that.
when
review
is
precluded,
that
conclusion
presumes
that
there
will
be
occasions...
there
could
be
occasions
when
there
would
be
mistakes
of
that...
of
that
type
made.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
because...
because
it...
well,
the
phrase
no
law
to
apply
is
a
phrase
that
this
court
has
developed
for
applying
what
is...
what
is
really
different
statutory
language
under
the
apa,
which
is
whether
the
agency
action
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law.
that's
the
ultimate
touchstone.
and
in
the
sort
of
example
that...
that
you're
describing,
the
conclusion
would
be
that
congress
has
committed
the
allocation
of
resources
in
a
whole
variety
of
circumstances
to
the...
to
the
discretion
of
the
indian
health
service.
in
part
from
necessity,
because
if
courts
were
going
to
get
in
the
business
of
second
guessing
every
decision
of
resource
allocation,
whether
to
purchase
equipment
for
one
hospital
and
not
another,
whether
to
reassign
a
doctor
from
one
health
clinic
to
another,
even
whether
a
patient
should
get
one
particular
type
of
care
or
another,
and...
and
base
that
on
whether
there
was...
whether
there
was
perhaps
a
factual
error,
or
what
could
be
claimed
to
be
a
factual
error
underlying
the
agency's
decision,
then
the...
the
indian
health
service
could
be
hamstrung
in
the...
in
the
delivery
of
health
services.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
legislative
history
can't
be
used
to
construe
a
statutory
term.
my
point
is
that
it
can't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
the
respondents'
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here
is
not
tied
to
any
language
in
the
lump
sum
appropriation
or
the
snyder
act
or
the
indian
health
care
improvements
act
that's
being
construed
with
the
assistance
of
that
language.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals,
again,
specifically
said
it's
difficult
to
find
any
manageable
standards
within
the...
within
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
or
the
snyder
act.
there's
no
statutory
text
in
either
one
that
says
this...
this
function
might
be
preferred
over
that
one.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
expenses
necessary
is
standard
language
in
an
appropriations
statute.
and
if...
and
if
that
language
was
thought
to
incorporate
every
representation
that
is
made
to
an
appropriations
committee,
frankly,
i
think
that
would
revolutionize
the
way
in
which...
in
which
agencies
and
congress
itself
and
gao
have
traditionally
regarded
the
appropriations--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they...
again,
i
guess
i'm
repeating
myself,
but
here
the
claim
is...
the
claim
is
not
that...
that
there
is
some...
they
have
not
pointed
to
language...
respondents
have
not
pointed
to
language
in
the
snyder
act
or
in
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
and
says
this
is
the
provision
that
it
violates.
these...
the
national
program
is
unquestionably
authorized
by
both
statutes,
and
the
only
question
is
in
choosing
among
authorized
functions,
whether
courts
have...
whether
that
matter
is
committed
to
agency
discretion.
and
that's
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
we
do.
the
other...
the
second
issue
in
the
case
concerns
the
court
of
appeals
requirement
that
the
indian
health
service
resort
to
notice
and
comment
rule-making
procedures
before
it
could
implement
the
decision
to
redirect
the
funds
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
announced
a
rule
that
notice
and
comment
requirements
are
necessary
anytime
the
government
cuts--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
might...
now
i
suppose
the
court
could
choose
to
address
the
notice
and
comment
first,
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
go
on
and
reach
the
merits
of
whether
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
simply
held
it
was
subject
to
review,
but
held
that
it
wouldn't
reach
the
merits
because
of
the
notice
and
comment
point
which
it
viewed
in
the
manner
of
a
threshold
issue.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
yes,
that's
correct.
and
the
court
of
the
appeals
held
that
notice
and
comment
is
required
anytime
the
government
cuts
back
on
congressionally
created
and
funded
benefits
for
indians,
even
if
the
indians
have
no
entitlement
to
those
benefits.
there
is,
in
our
view,
no
basis
for
that
new
requirement.
it
conflicts
with
vermont
yankee,
which
bars
courts
from
imposing
additional
procedural
requirements
on
agencies
that
are
not
required
by
law.
and
significantly,
also,
it
fails
to
respect
that...
the
judgment
of
congress
when
congress
thought
that
input
from
indians
was
necessary
in
the
formulation
of
indian
health
programs.
in
1980...
in
the
1988
amendments
to
the
indian
health
care
program
that
we
mention
in
footnote
36
of
our
brief,
congress
specifically
addressed
this
problem
in
the
context
of
facilities,
permanent
facilities,
and
it
said
that
whenever
the
indian
health
service
is
contemplating
constructing,
renovating,
or
closing
a
facility,
it
must
consult
with
the
tribe
concerned
before
it
does
that
and,
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
closing
a
facility
must
notify
congress.
congress...
significantly,
congress
did
not
impose
any
such
requirement
of
consultation
with
respect
to
services
under
the
statutory
provisions
that
we
have
here,
services
as
opposed
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
that's...
that
is
the
ground
that...
that's
the
rationale
that
the
district
court
applied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court...
the
court
of
appeals
announced
this
broader
rule
that
it
thought
came
from
this
court's
decision
in
morton
v.
ruiz,
which
we...
which
we
believe
was...
was,
first
of
all,
an
overreading
of
morton
v.
ruiz
and
did
not
take
into
account
subsequent
developments,
on
that
point
vermont
yankee,
and
also
the
notion
that
an
agency
has
to...
can
only
administer
a
program
like
this
through
legislative
rules,
we
think
is
inconsistent
will
bell
aerospace
which
allows
an
agency
some
discretion.
but
on
the
apa
point
on
whether
this
constitutes
a
rule--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we...
we
think
that
it...
that
it
clearly
does
not.
the
decision
to
reallocate
these
resources
was
a
self-contained
decision.
it
was...
yes,
it
was
communicated
verbally
and,
yes,
it
had
some
future
consequences,
but
that
does
not
convert
it
into
a
rule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it...
in
a
way
that
has
future
legal
consequences
is
what...
is
what
really
characterizes
a
rule.
we
don't
believe
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
statutory
definition
of
a
rule,
intended
to
depart
fundamentally
from
the...
from
the
core
of
what
a
rule
is.
a
rule...
another
word
for
rule
is
a
regulation,
something
that
has...
that
has
binding
effect
or
at
least
legal
force
to
it,
that...
that
guides,
in
a
legal
manner,
the
future
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does
include
general
statements
of
policy.
but
policy
in
a
sense
that
the
statement
itself
has
an
abiding
future
effect.
in
this
case
the...
in
this
case
there
really
was
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
well
first...
first
of
all,
there
is
a
program.
all
the...
all
the...
the
children
in
these
service
areas
will
continue
to
be
serviced
by
the
national
program.
it's
just
that
the...
that
all
indian
children
throughout
the
country
will
get
the
same
services,
rather
than
the
regional
program...
children
in
this
one
region
getting
something
different.
but
it
has
a
practical
consequence,
we
don't
deny
that.
but
in
order
to
be
a
rule,
the
statement
itself,
the
statement
has
to
have
a
continuing
future
legal
effect.
and
here
the
decision
to
reallocate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it...
it
would...
it
would
assign
in
a
formal
way.
i
mean
formality
has
a
lot
to
do
with
what's
a
rule.
it
would
assign
in
a
formal
way
where
various
statutory
responsibilities
are
to
be
assigned
within
the
agency,
which
assistant
secretary
is
responsible
for
which
programs,
so
that
one
can
look
and
see
who
has
the
authority
to
exercise
legal
power,
statutory
power
delegated
from
the
secretary,
and
where
various
programs
will
reside.
and
that
has
a
lot
to
do
with...
with
the
way
in
which
governmental
authority
is
exercised.
but
here...
at
bottom,
what
happened
here
was
nothing
more
than
a...
than
the
sort
of
directive
that
a
superior
may
give
to
a...
to
an
employee
saying
instead
of
doing
this
type
of
work,
confining
your
work
to
a
regional
program,
starting
tomorrow
your
job
description
is
somewhat
different,
you're
being
assigned
to
new...
to
new
responsibilities.
that
decision
was
consummated
at
that
time
and
it
was
communicated
verbally
in
a
variety
of
ways,
one
of
which
was
a
memorandum
to
health
service
units
contained
at
page
80
of
the
joint
appendix.
but
the
fact
that
the
statement
was
communicated
or
that
the
decision
was
communicated
in
a
statement
didn't
mean
that
the
statement
itself
had
any
future
legal
consequences.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
might
be
a
relevant
factor.
i
mean,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it's
difficult
to
come
up
with
any
one
principle
that
will
solve
all
places.
but
we
do
think
that
formality
and
continuing
legal
effect
are
really
the
two
cental
hallmarks
of
what
a
rule
is,
both
in
ordinary
meaning
and
the
special
sense
in
which
it...
in
which
it's
used.
so
even
in
the
situation
you're
talking
about
where
a
decision
might
be
made
to...
to
engage
in
a
certain
program,
that
doesn't
convert
it
into
a
rule.
i
think
that
the
court's
decision
is
overton
park
is
very
instructive
as
a
parallel
to
this
case.
there
the
court
specifically
held
that
the
department
of
transportation's
decision
to
fund
a
particular
program
out
of
its
appropriated
funds
was
not
a
rule.
and
this
is,
in
our
view,
directly
parallel
to
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is...
there
is
an
exception.
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
like
most
agencies,
has
agreed
to
follow
notice
and
comment
procedures--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
that.
there
may
be
some
question
of
whether
these
direct
services
are...
are
benefits--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--within
the
meaning
of
that
exception
or
whether
it
just
means
cash
transfers.
but
in
any
event,
we
haven't
relied
on
that
exception
here
because
it's...
it's
been...
it's
been
waived.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
order
for
there
to
be
publication,
it
would...
the
decision
here
would
have
to
be
a
rule,
so
our
argument
that
it's
not
a
rule
subsumes
both
the
publication
requirement
and
the
notice
and
comment
requirement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
a
couple
points
i
wanted
to
make
on
each
of
the
issues.
first,
on
the
notice
and
comment
issue,
on
the
question
of...
of
individualized
notice
which
counsel
for
respondents
mentioned,
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
indian
health
service
was
not
the
primary
provider
of
care
in
these
circumstances.
it
was
always
a
backup
or
secondary
consultative
role
that
ihs
personnel
were
performing.
the
children
involved
had
primary
care
givers
and
the
indian
health
service
did
give
individualized
notice
to
the
primary
care
givers
and
held
community
meetings
to
assist
them
in
developing
alternative
resources,
which
was
the
sort
of
approach
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
in
addition,
notice
and
comment
is
not
well
suited
to
obtaining
the
input
of
the
indian
people
in
a
circumstance
such
as
this.
but
neither
congress
nor
the
indian
health
service
has
been
indifferent
to
the
need
to
get
input,
but
they've
chosen
a
different
way,
which
was...
which
was
a
system
of
consultation
with
the
tribes
concerned.
i've
mentioned
the...
the
consultation
with
tribes
that
congress
required
for
facility
alterations
in
the
1988
amendments
which
are
in
25
usc
1631,
but
in
addition
the
amicus
brief
of
six
tribes
in
this
case
cites
several
documents
which
describe
the
indian
health
service's
broader
system
of
consultation
through
a
national
health
board,
through
health
boards
at
the
local
level
for
the
various
clinics,
and
consultations
with
the
tribes
concerned
about
the
delivery
of
services
on
their
reservations.
that
is
the
form
of
consultation
and
input
that
is
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
it's
also
appropriate
to
the
indian
health
service's
mission,
which
is
one
from
a
public
health
perspective,
not
one
of
individual
entitlement
to...
to
medical
services,
but
a
public
health
service
which
requires
them
to
look
at
the
big
picture
and
mortality
rates
and
where...
where
services
are
needed
in
the
main.
on
the
question
of
what's
committed
to
agency...
that
this
is
committed
to
agency--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
think
it's
agency
action,
but
it's
a
self-contained
decision
with
no
lasting
consequences
in
itself.
on
the
question
of
committed
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
do
not.
that
there's
a
large
category--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--informal
action,
yes,
i
think
that's
necessarily
so,
or...
or
agencies
would
be
hamstrung.
on
the
question
of
committed
to
agency
discretion,
it's...
i
want
to
emphasize
again
several
points.
one,
the
statements
in
the
committee
reports
have
long
been...
on
appropriations
acts
have
long
been
understood
by
the
gao,
i
think
by
congress
itself,
and
by
executive
agencies,
not
to
be
intended
to
create
binding
legal
obligations.
and
to
change
that
understanding
of
those
sorts
of
exchanges
in
the
appropriations
process
would,
in
gao's
view
and
the
executive
branch's
view,
change
that
process
radically.
also,
on
the
question
of
what
is...
when
something
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law,
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
whether
there's
law
to
apply
is
just
one
way
of
getting
at
that
question.
there
are
other
factors
in...
that
this
court
has
recognized,
including
whether
the
issue
is
one
that's
traditionally
been
regarded
as
committed
to
agency
discretion,
which
the
allocation
of
appropriated
funds
is.
and
also
whether
there
would
be
unduly
disruptive
consequences
of
allowing
judicial
review,
and
for
the
reasons
i've
described
there
clearly
would
be
here,
because
it
would
subject
numerous
myriad
decisions
of
the
indian
health
service
and
the
administration
of
this
vast
program
to
the
potential
for
judicial
review
on
basis
of
facts
or
disagreement
about
the
ordering
of
priorities.
which
brings
me
to
the
last
point
on
that,
and
that
is
directly
tied
to
heckler
v.
chaney,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned,
that
this
is
a
case
going
to
the
core
of
the
allocation
of
scarce
agency
resources
among
the
various
demands
on
the
agency's
time
and
energy,
and
that
is,
again,
necessarily
something
committed
to
agency
discretion.
thank
you.
