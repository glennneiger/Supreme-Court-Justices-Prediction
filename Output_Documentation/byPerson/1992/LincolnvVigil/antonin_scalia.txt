justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
have
a
text
here
which
is,
you
know,
a
certain
amount
of
money.
and
you
don't...
it
doesn't...
you
don't
know
what
that
money's
supposed
to
be
used
for,
and
this
legislative
history
clarifies
what
it's
to
be
used
for.
why
is
that
any
different
from
a
piece
of
legislative
history
that
clarifies
the
meaning
of
a
prohibition?
it's
totally
ambiguous.
you'd
think
the
agency
can
take
a
number
of
different
views
of
what
it
means.
if
you
find
it
clarified
in
the
legislative
history,
that's
what
it
means.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
kneedler,
suppose
you
had
a
statute
that...
that
authorizes
an
agency...
instructs
an
agency
to
pro...
and
this
is
an
instruction
to...
to
expend
the
funds
as
well...
to
prohibit
those
activities
that
are
harmful
to
the
environment.
and
the
legislative
history,
the
committee
reports
of
both
houses,
say
we
anticipate
that
this
will
include
prohibition
of,
and
then
fill
it
something,
you
know
dumping...
by...
by
chemical
companies.
you
think
that
legislative
history
would
not
be...
would
not
be
taken
into
account
by
this
court
in...
in...
in
determining
whether
the
agency
had
authority
to,
or...
or
had
to
prohibit
that
dumping
by
chemical
companies?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
and
the
operative
word
here
is...
is
purposes
authorized
by
these
other
statutes.
what
purposes
in
particular?
well,
here's
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
suppose...
here's
how...
it
says
for
expenses
necessary
to
carry
out
the
act
of
august
15,
1954,
blah,
blah,
blah,
that's
how
the
appropriations
reads.
suppose
the...
the
committee,
both...
the
appropriations
committees
in
both
houses,
there's
language
in
the
report
that
says
we
anticipate
that
some
of
this
money
will
go
to
this
particular
schooling
program.
it
is
later
contended
that
that
schooling
program
is
not
an
authorized
program
on
which
the
appropriations
can
be
expended;
that
question
comes
up
in
a
lawsuit.
you
mean
that...
that
committee
legislative
history
would
not
be
used
by
the
government
to
establish--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
what
they're
doing
here.
they're...
they're
saying
this
shows
the
expense
is
necessary
to
carry
out,
they
anticipated
it,
this
is
one
of
the
things
to
be
carried
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
text
in
the
appropriations
act;
expenses
necessary
to
carry
out
the
act
of
august
5,
1954.
it's
clear
in
the
appropriations
committee
that
one
of
the
things
they
thought
necessary
was
this
program.
why
isn't
that
statutory
language--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
know.
i
mean
you
say
that
in
your
brief.
you
say
well,
it's
just
puffing;
it's
not
unusual
for
congressional
committee
members
to
attempt
to
influence
the
expenditure
of
general
appropriations
by
way
of
statements
in
committee
reports,
as
though
they
don't
do
that
in
other
contexts.
how
do
you
identify
the
one
from
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
rules
of
agency
organization,
which
are
referred
to
in
the
apa?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does...
how
does
a
reorganization
of
the
agency
have
a
future
legally
binding
effect
on
any
outside
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
isn't
there
an
exception
anyway?
even
if
it
were
a
rule,
isn't
there
an
except
for
rules
related...
to
notice
and
comment
rule
making
for
rules
relating
to
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jasperse,
you
claim
rule
making
was
necessary
to
terminate
the
program.
you
say
it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
applied
to
begin
the
program
either.
i
assume
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
begin
the
program
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
before...
to
establish
it.
and
if
they
had
decided
not
to
establish
it...
since
the
apa
defines
agency
action
to
include
agency
inaction,
if
they
had
not
established
the
program,
they
would
have
also
have
to
had
rule
making
in
order
not
to
establish
the
program,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
read
the
apa;
agency
action
includes
inaction.
any
decision
not
to
have
the
program
would
require
rule
making,
just
as
a
decision
to
have
it
would
require
rule
making
and,
as
you
say,
a
decision
to
terminate
it
would
require
rule
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
rule
making
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
decision
not
to
spend
money
on
this
program
in
the
first
place
is
a
decision
that
has
future
effect;
as
you
say,
it's
going
to
deprive
these
people
of
the
money.
and
the
decision
not
to
have
it
under
the
apa
is
just
as
much
a
decision
as
the
decision
to
have
it,
so
you
would
need...
you
would
need
rule
making
endlessly
for
all
programs
you
begin,
for
all
programs
you
end,
and
for
all
programs
you
don't
begin.
i...
you
know,
i
don't
know
where
the
end
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
all
the
other
people
on
whom
money
was
not
being
spent?
were
they
also
entitled
to
an
explanation
of
why
money
was
not
being
spent
on
them?
i
mean
you're
not
the
only
people.
there
you're
joining
the
vast
majority
of
the
citizens
on
whom
this
money
is
not
being
spent.
what...
what
is
the
reason
for
your
special
entitlement
to
a
notice
and
comment
rule
making
on
this
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
one
applies
to
everybody
else.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
why
everybody
else
isn't
entitled
to
it.
what's
the...
what
are
the
other
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jasperse,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
"law
to
apply"
aspect
of
this
for
a
moment.
some
agencies
have
as
their
function
disbursing
money,
as
these
agencies
have
as
a
large
part
of
theirs,
or
disbursing
benefits.
other
agencies
are
enforcement
agencies
principally
and
don't
give
out
much
money.
in
a
case
called
heckler
v.
chaney
we
decided
that
there
was
no
law
to
apply,
to
basis
for
a
cause
of
action
against
an
agency
asserting
that
it
had
to
exert
its
enforcement
priorities
in
this
manner
rather
than
in
another
manner.
we
said
there
are
lot
of
different
manners
it
can
use;
it's
up
to
the
agency
to
decide
where
to
devote
its
limited
enforcement
resources.
now,
why
doesn't
that
principle
carry
over
very
well
to...
to
an
agency
that's
in
the
disbursement
of
benefits
business?
to
the
same
extent,
there
really
is
no
law
to
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
only
because
the
agency
has
limited
enforcement
resources,
just
as
these
agencies
have
limited
distribution
resources.
it
has
to
put
it
one
place
or
another
place,
and
it
decided
to
do
it
in
places
that
the
plaintiffs
didn't
like.
the
same
thing's
happening
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
if
there
is
no
law
to
apply,
there
is
all
the
more
need
for
the
notice
and
comment
procedures
that
the
law
requires.
because
of
the
agency
having
a
free
hand
and
not
being
controllable
by
the
courts,
there's
all
the
more
reason
for
insisting
that
it
listen
to
the
public
as
the
law
requires
it
to
do,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
at
all
agency
action
is
divided
into
rules
and
orders,
that
there's
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--third
category
that
we
don't
know
what
they
are.
