justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well
i
suppose
those
acts
would...
would
provide
law
to
apply
for
some
questions
that
might
arise
under
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
were
providing
help
for
non-indians.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
that
extent
there's
law
to
apply
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether...
whether
you
can
go
to
a
national
program.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
discretion
provided
under
these
acts
is
any
greater
than,
for
example,
the
discretion
given
to...
was
it
the
department
of
transportation
in
the
state
farm
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
just
provide
motor
vehicle
standards
that
met
the
need
for
motor
vehicle
safety.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
were
pretty
broad.
i
just...
i
just
wonder
how
you
distinguish
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
let
me
pose
this
to
you.
suppose
the
bia
established
a...
a
health
care
program
for
indians
with
displaced
children...
with
displaced
hips,
and
then
it
decided
later
to
terminate
that
because
it
understood
that
indian
children
with
displaced
hill...
hips
would
be
served
for
their
health
needs
by
a
state
agency.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
let's
suppose
that...
that
assumption
is
factually
incorrect,
so
they've
cut
off
the
services
based
on
an
incorrect
factual
assumption.
is
there
no
law
to
apply?
is
that
unreviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
before...
before
you
get
there,
did
the
court
below
reject
the
proposition
about
unreviewability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we...
we
must
address
that
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
at
least
need
to
address
the
notice
and
comment
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
does
the
apa
definition
of
rule
include
policy
statements?
is
it
a...
is
the
decision
to
terminate
this
project
possibly
a
rule
under
that
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-hum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
been...
it's
been
interpreted
broadly
to
cover
statements
issued
by
an
agency
to
advise
the
public
prospectively
of
the
manner
in
which
an
agency
proposes
to
exercise
a
discretionary
power.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
been...
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
attorney
general's
commentary
as
including
general
statements
of
policy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it'll
have
an
effect
all
right,
there
won't
be
a
program
available.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
on
a
small
point,
there...
the
court
below
ordered
publication.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
question
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
no
notice
and
comment
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you...
you
don't
win
if
it
isn't
a
rule.
