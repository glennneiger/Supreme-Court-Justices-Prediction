mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
jasperse,
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
lower
courts
were
correct
in
requiring
notice
and
comment
in
this
case,
and
to
understand
why
it's
critical
that
you
understand
how
the
program
was
implemented
in
the
first
place
and
how
it
was
operated.
this
program,
the
indian
children's
program,
was
implemented
in
a
direct
response
to
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act,
which
was
passed
in
1976.
that
act
was
passed
to
provide
supplemental
funding
for
indian
programs,
supplemental
to
the
snyder
act.
title
ii
of
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
specifically
authorizes
funding
for
known
unmet
indian
health
needs
and
specifically
authorizes
funding
for
therapeutic
and
residential
treatment
centers.
it
was
in
response
to
that
language
in
this
act
that
the
agency
implemented
this
indian
children's
program.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
it
did
not,
your
honor.
initially,
the
agency
envisioned
a
$3.5
million
facility.
that
was
never
funded.
they
initially
chose
to
center
that
facility
near
albuquerque
for
a
number
of
reasons,
primarily
because
the
large
indian
population
which
then-director
emery
johnson
described
as
half
of...
roughly
half
of
the
indian
population
residing
in
the
states
of
new
mexico
and
arizona.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
did
not--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--no,
your
honor,
in
those
two
states.
those
were
his
words,
his
characterization
of
the
indian
population
at
that
time.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
those
were
his
words,
your
honor.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
did
not
support
the
center.
one
of
the
reasons
was
they
did
not
feel
that
an
inpatient
center
like
this
would
meet
their
mandate,
under
a
separate
act
relating
to
special
education,
to
provide
services
in
the
least
restrictive
environment.
so
what
happened
was
the
indian
children's
program
was
formulated
anyway
by
the...
the
indian
health
service,
by
going
ahead
and
forming
specialized
teams.
they
felt
that
the
staff,
the
specialized
staff
that
was
needed
to
provide
these
services
was
going
to
be
needed
regardless
of
whether
they
had
a
brick
and
mortar
facility.
the
team
was...
was
formed
in
1978.
it
was
centered
in
albuquerque
and
it
proceeded
to
go
out
into
nearby
indian
communities
to
provide
various
services,
primarily
diagnostic
and
treatment
services.
to
its
credit,
the
indian
health
service
recognized
that
there
was
a
critical
need
for
diagnostic
and
treatment
services.
they
realized
that
observers
felt
that
this
situation
was
one
comparable
to
the
national
situation
35
years
before,
at
the
time
of
the
second
world
war.
eventually
a
memorandum
of
agreement
was
signed
by
the
two
agencies.
they
agreed
to
try
out
this
concept
of
working
together
to
provide
these
services.
and
in
1979,
the
fall
of
1979,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
did
join
this
effort.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
when...
when
the
agency
is
implementing
law
like
this,
establishing
services,
that
they
should
have
undergone
notice
and
comment
before
getting
to
establish--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--i
don't
believe
so,
if
they
were
not
going
to--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--we
certainly
agree.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
i
can't
concede
that
inaction
requires
rule
making.
they're
not...
they're
not
taking
anything...
they're
not
taking
any
action
prospectively
there
that's
of
a
generalized
nature--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--that
implements
a
policy--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--well,
we...
we
believe
very
strongly
in
this
case
that
where
the
agency
did,
in
fact,
undertake
this
operation
and
do
so
in
response
to
the
statute,
as
well
as
its
federal
trust
responsibility
to
indian
people;
that
when
they,
over
time,
operated
this
program,
provided
these
kind
of
services,
established
eligibility
rules
that
set
out
what
services
were
to
be...
to
be
provided
and
who
was
to
receive
them;
that
when
they
went
ahead
and
disestablished
that
program,
that
that--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--the
agency.
the
agency--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--the
indian
health
service.
this
was
a
joint
effort,
but
only
the
indian
health
service
made
this
particular
decision.
in
fact,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was...
did
not
even
receive
notice
until
they
received
the
actual
termination
letter
that
the
agency...
the
indian
health
service
sent
out.
what
happened
during
this
time
is
that
the
eligibility
criteria
that
were
adopted
by
the
agency
were
applied.
and,
basically,
those
eligibility
criteria
were
such
that
only
children
in
certain
areas
of
the
southwest
were
to
receive
those
services
and
only
children
who
were
within
certain...
a
certain
age
range,
birth
to
age
21,
and
who
were
handicapped,
were
to
receive
these
services.
and
so
these
teams
traveled
out
into
the
indian
communities,
into
reservation
areas,
areas
that
were
remote,
that
were
rural,
that
were
isolated
and
oftentimes
small,
and
provided
these
diagnostic
and
treatment
services.
what's
also
important
to
understand
is
that
throughout
the
operation
of
this
program
every
year
in
testimony
to
the
congressional
committees
regarding
appropriations,
the
agency
continuously
told
the
agency,
this
is
a
critical
program
for
these
children,
it's
a
successful
program,
we
are
providing
these
specific
diagnostic
and
treatment
services
to
them,
certain
children
are
eligible
for
these
services
and
we
want
continued
funding
for
this
program.
and
congress
appears
to
have
responded
favorably
to
these
requests.
they
received
the
information
in
a
favorable
light
and
we
think
there
was...
this
showed
intent
by
the
congress,
through
its
appropriations
committee,
to
continue
this
program
in
the
form
that
the
agency
then
did.
in
october
1984,
officials
in
the
rockville,
maryland
headquarters
east
portion
of
the
indian
health
service
began
urging
that
this
program
be
changed,
that
the...
the
form
that
it
was
in
at
that
point,
which
was
a
regional
program,
be
changed
to
a
national
scope
program
that
would
provide
consulting
and
training.
sometime
in
1985...
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
exactly
when
this
decision
was
made,
but
sometime
in
1985
the
decision
was
made
to
eliminate
the
indian
children's
program
as
a
direct
service
program.
this
termination
decision
was
announced
in
a
letter
in
august
of
1985.
this
termination
letter,
single
letter,
is
the
only
explanation
that
the
agency
provided
or
that
gives
us
any
information
as
to
what
it
was
doing
and
why
it
was
doing
this.
one
of
our
arguments
here
in
terms
of
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
argument
is
that
a
single
letter
that
simply
tells
what
they
were
doing
without
any
explanation
is
not...
not
sufficient
to
provide
us
with
a
reasoned
explanation
of
its
action.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
we
believe
that
notice
and
comment
is
afforded,
first,
because
this
was
a
rule,
a
legislative
rule
under
the
apa.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
second--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--second...
your
honor,
there
are
four
reasons
why
we--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--okay.
the
others,
your
honor,
are
that
there
is
an...
under
the
indian
trust
responsibility,
there
is
a
specific
duty
to
deal
fairly.
we
think
if
that...
that
language,
which
was
stated
by
this
court
in
morton
v.
ruiz,
is
to
mean
anything--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--is
not
simply
an
empty
phrase
that
this
court
used,
that
that
at
least
means
fairness
to
these
children.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
and
fairness
here,
in
this
context,
means
some
kind
of
procedural
protection.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
there
is
clearly
a
specific
fiduciary
duty
when...
when
it
comes
to
land,
your
honor.
however,
this...
this
court...
and
the
government
doesn't
dispute
this,
that
there
is
a
general
overriding
trust
responsibility
that
the
government
has.
what
they're...
that
they
are--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--not...
not...
i'm
not
arguing
that
point
under
the
apa.
the
apa...
the
notice
and
comment
here
in
this
case
can
stand
regardless
of
whether
it
involved
indian
people
or
not,
with
this
type
of
action.
what
i'm
arguing
here
as
a
second
basis
for
affirming
the
notice
and
comment
is
that
the
overriding
trust
responsibility--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--no.
i'm
arguing
that
in
this
particular
context
the
apa
would
afford
them
notice
and
comment
regardless
of
whether
they
were
indian
people.
but
in
addition
to
that,
this
duty
to
deal
fairly
must
mean
something--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--let
me
address
your
question
by
referring
to
morton
v.
ruiz.
in
that
case
you
also
had
indian
people.
in
that
case
there
were...
it
was
a
snyder
act
program
similar
to
this
one.
it
wasn't
specifically
required
by
statute,
it
was
funded
under
lump
sum,
there
weren't
specific
eligibility
rules
required
by
the...
by
the
statute.
in
that
case
this
court
said
that
the...
because
there
is
an
overriding
duty
of
trust
under
this
general
trust
responsibility,
that
the
continued
expectation,
the
legitimate
expectation
of
those
general
assistance
recipients
in
that
case,
could
not
be
extinguished
unless
there
was
notice
and
comment.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
well,
we...
we
would...
we
would
submit
that
even
if
it
was
a
general
statement
of
policy--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--that
that
presumes
it
was
at
least
a
rule
in
the
first
place,
and
so
that
it
comes
within
the
purview
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
a
statement
of
general
policy
must
at
least
be
published
in
the
federal
register,
and
this
is--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
would
at
least
have
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
which
would
give
publication
notice,
and
that
is
one
of
the
independent
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
did
rule
in
favor
of
the
children's
suit
under
the
apa.
and
so
the...
the
point
is
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
for
the
children
whether
or
not
this
was
a
legislative
rule
requiring
notice
and
comment
under
section
553
or
whether
it
was
a
statement
of
general
policy
requiring
federal
register
publication
under
section
552,
either
way
we
win.
the
government's
argument
is
that
this
is
an
action
that...
that's
not
a
rule
at
all
and
so
doesn't
come
within
the
apa.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
that's
correct.
it
must
be
a
rule.
and
our
argument
here
is
that
this
was
clearly
prospective
in
nature,
it
was
generalized
in
nature,
it
applied
to
all
of
these
children.
and
it...
and
it
prescribed
policy.
this
was
a
change
that
the
agency
made
from
following
one
course
of
action
to
a
very
different
course
of
action.
that
change
was
a
change
in
terms
of
how
it
was...
how
it
was
deciding
to
implement
its
reading
of
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act,
the
specific
therapeutic
and
treatment
centers
provision
in
the
act.
and
so
when
they
make
a
change
in
their
reading
of
the
law
and
change
their
whole
program
as
a
result
of
that,
that's
at
least
a
statement
of
general...
general
policy.
and
it's...
and
it's
certainly
a
rule.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
well,
we
would
argue
that
the
heckler
v.
chaney
type
of
nonenforcement
decision
was
really
one
that
was
not
primarily
a
resource-type
allocation
decision,
but
a
decision
whether
to
take
a
specific
type
of
action
that
it
could
under
the
statute.
this--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--well,
i
think...
i
think
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
this
court
has...
has
answered
that
by
saying
that
when
there
are
limited...
limited
funds,
and
you're
going
to
change
a
program
from
what
it
was
doing
before
and
when
you're
going
to
extinguish
an
expectation
that
the
services
that
were
there
before,
that
you
have
to
at
least
give
the
people
the
kind
of
notice
so
that
they
know
what's
happening.
and
that's
the
notice
and
comment
requirement
that
comes
in
under
morton
v.
ruiz.
and
even
if
there
insufficient
funds
and
their...
and
the
agency
has
to
do
this
reallocation,
it
has
to
be
done
in
such
a
way
that
it's
fair
to
the
children.
and
it's
not
fair
to
the
children,
given
this
overriding
trust
responsibility
to
deal
fairly
with
them,
if...
if
the
agency
simply
abruptly
stops
the
services
here.
i
would
add
that
it's...
it
seems
illogical
and
totally
incomprehensible
that
when
the
agency
has
a
specific
mandate
under
the
snyder
act,
a
mandatory
requirement
that
it
act
with
respect
to
indians
to
conserve
health,
that
they
not
at
least,
when
they're...
when
they're
abruptly
terminating
these
services,
to
give
them
notice.
notice,
just
as
a
matter
of
general
common
sense,
would
have
been
proper
here,
and
something
that
would
have
assisted
them
in
maintaining
their
health.
it
might
be
similar
when
we
get...
those...
those
of
us
here
who
are
covered
by
private
health
insurance,
we
would
be...
feel
very
unfairly
treated
if...
if
the
coverer
simply
dropped
the...
the
coverage
that
we
have
without
telling
us,
or
changed
a
provision
in
the
coverage
without
telling
us.
if
the
children
had
known
ahead
of
time,
if
they
had
been
given
notice,
they
could
have
at
least
have
attempted
to
locate
and
find
those
alternative
services
that
the
government
says
was
readily
available,
to
make
some
sort
of
a
transition.
without
that
transition,
they
fell
into...
fell
between
the
cracks;
there
was
a
gap
of
time.
and
the
record
is
very
clear
on
that
point,
that
loss
of
services
to
these
type
of
children
harms
them.
the
type
of
treatment
services
that
they
need
you
cannot
accumulate.
and
so
loss
of
services
over
even
a
couple
of
months
was
detrimental
to
their
health.
what
the
government
is
really
asking
this
court
to
do
here
in
its
argument
that
there
is
no
law
to
apply,
is
to...
is
to
write
a
blank
check.
we
have
relied
on,
in
this
case,
all
of
the
indian
health
care
law
that
there
is.
if
there
is
no
law
to
apply
here
under
the
snyder
act
and
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
and
the
indian
health
service
manual
and
so
on,
no
indian
people
will
ever
be
able
to
obtain
judicial
review.
it
will
be
completely
foreclosed.
we
don't--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--no,
your
honor,
the
case
is
not
over.
the...
both
lower
courts--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--if
there's
no...
no
notice
and
comment
requirement
and
it's
that
this
is
not
totally
a
matter
of
agency
discretion,
the
case
is
not
over.
it
would...
would
require
remand
to
the
district
court--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--yes,
your
honor,
yes.
and
in...
with
respect
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
argument--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--no,
it
did
not.
it...
it
found
that
all
that
was
necessary
here...
because
there
were
procedural
violations,
that
it
wasn't
about
to
go
further
and
make
a
merits
ruling.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
we
think
if...
if
it's...
if
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion,
that
that...
that
all
that
goes
to
is...
is
the
review
on
the
merits
itself,
whether
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
contrary
to
law.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
the
procedural
violations
claims
are
still
there
and
there
is
separate
law
to
apply
to
those.
and
that
separate
law
is,
of
course,
section
552
and
section
553.
so
that
you
would
have
to
rule
both
that
there
is
no...
there
was
no
rule
here,
so
that
there
was
neither
552
federal
publication
or
notice
and
comment
under
553,
and
you
would
have
to
rule
that
this
is
totally
and
completely
discretionary,
that
there
is
simply
no
law
of
any
kind
to
apply
here
to
this
action.
in
order
for
it
to
go--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--yes,
your
honor.
it's...
there
it's
crucial
that...
that
the
courts
be
available
to
small
disenfranchised
minorities
such
as
these
children
were.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
right,
right.
it
must
be
a
rule
to
get
federal
register
publication
and
it
must
be
a
rule
to
get--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--it...
it
would
depend
on
the
reason
that
they
reduced
the
employees.
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
that...
that
would
not
be
a
rule.
there's
no
prescription
of
law
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
however,
if
they
were
to
decide
to
redeploy
the
staff
to
meet
a
specific
statutory
requirement,
to
meet...
meet
the
mandate
of
their
law
in
some
specific
way,
then
they
would
be
implementing
the
statute
and
that
would
be
prescription
of
law,
and
that--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--it...
again,
it
depends
on
whether
you're
doing
that
simply
as
a
matter
of
agency
management
or
whether
you're
doing
that
because
the
law
requires
something--
mr.
joel
r.
jasperse
--in
that
case,
that's...
that...
that
would
be
prescription
of
law.
you're
implementing
a
statute
there,
and
that
would
be
a
rule
that
requires...
that
would
be
a
rule
in
that
instance.
we
believe
that
judicial
review
is
appropriate
in
this
case
both
because
this
action
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
the
program
changed
its
course
of
conduct,
it
changed
its
policy
without
any
explanation.
again,
all
we
have
is
a
single
letter
that
says
what
they
were
going
to
do,
but
did
not
provide
any
explanation.
they
also
made
this
decision
without
justifying...
making
an
unjustified
factual
assumption
that
there
would
be
readily
available
alternative
services.
that
the
children
have
made
a
clear
showing...
and,
in
fact,
the
district
court
found
that
the
children's
allegations
in
this
regard
were
essentially
unrebutted.
and
the
agency
must,
in
order
to
make
this
decision
in
a
manner
that
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
do
so
in
a
way
that's
adequately
informed,
that
considers
all
the
relevant
factors
and
provides
a
reasoned
explanation.
and
finally,
we
are
asserting,
of
course,
that
this
action
was
directly
contrary
to
the
law,
particularly
the
snyder
act...
this
goes
directly
contrary
to
its
requirement
that
the
agency
take
actions
which
conserve
health...
and
also
the
indian
health
care
improvement
act
requirement
that
they
maintain
and
improve
and
try
to
achieve
the
highest
possible
health
status
for
these
children.
i
would
like
to
close
and...
and
i
think
particularly
with
respect
to
law,
law
to
apply,
it's
perhaps
fitting
to
remember
the
words
of
the
gospel
of
matthew
where
jesus
says
"suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me.
"
i
would
ask
that
you
do
no
less,
don't
close
the
courthouse
doors
on
these
kids.
please
at
least
afford
them
judicial
review.
thank
you.
