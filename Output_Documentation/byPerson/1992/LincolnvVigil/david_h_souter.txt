could
you...
could
you
imagine
a
case
in
which
the
legislative
history
would
contain
an
indication
of
congressionally
ordered
priorities
so
that
the
legislative
history
would
somehow
indicate
that
the
first
priority
in
the
snyder
act
is
for
disabled
children--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and...
is
that...
and
is
that
law
to
apply
if
the
agency
ignores
the
funding
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
funding
priority?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
so...
so
long
as
the
spending
is
authorized
by
one
of
three
statutory
mandates,
there
can
be
no
review
as
to
how
the
agency
allocates
the
fundings
among
those
three.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
can
it
provide
that
guidance
in
legislative
history?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
justice
o'connor
can
defend
her
own
hypothetical
if
she
wants
to,
i
suppose,
but
i'd
like
to
have
an
answer
to
it.
suppose
that
this
is
the
reason
that
state
funding
duplicates
this
program
and
that
reason
is
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
factually
unsound--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
my
question
is,
is
there
law
to
apply?
can
there
be
judicial
review
and
judicial
correction
of
that...
of
that
agency
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
arbitrary
and
unreasonable?
could
it...
could
you
make
out
a
case
that
it's
arbitrary
and
unreasonable--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
there
was...
there
was
clear
evidence
that
the
state
program
did
not
provide
the...
the
care
and
the
agency
just
ignored
clear
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
review
is
precluded,
again,
because
there's
no
law
to
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
conclusion
that
you
draw
or
don't
want
us
to
draw
depend
on
the
context?
for
example,
if
we
were
dealing
here
with
a...
an
agency
action
which
was
preceded
by
a
whole
body
of
what
everybody
agrees
would
be
rules
about
how
the
agency
ought
to
allocate
its
money
and
so
on,
then
perhaps
your
argument
would
have
great
force.
you
would
say
well
this
is
just
trivial,
this
is
basically
just
a
reassignment
of
people.
but
where
there
is
not
such
a
body
of...
of
rules
in
existence,
this
has
far
greater
significance,
i.e.
it
determines
whether
there
is
going
to
be
a
certain
kind
of
program
or
not.
is
that
kind
of
contextual
contrast
a
legitimate
thing
to
take
into
consideration?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
it
engage
in
rule
making
when
it
instituted
the
program?
