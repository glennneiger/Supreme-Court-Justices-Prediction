we'll

michael

grover
vigil
or
vigil.
spectators
are
reminded
not
to
talk
while
you're
in
the

mr.

you
may
proceed.

about
roughly
half
of

residing

half
the
indian
population
in
the
united
states

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
jasperse,
in
the
case,
i
forget
what
the
name
was,
i
think
it's
cherokee,
we
decided
two
or
three...
we
said
the
concept
of
the
indian
trust
responsibility
is
basically
a
responsibility
for
land,
not
any
general
duty
of
heightened
fair
dealing
with
indians.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
should...
that
should
make
the
standards
of
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
different
when
indians
are
parties
plaintiff
than
when
other
people
are
parties
plaintiff?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
indians
are
entitled
to
notice
and
comment
even
though
non-indians
in
precisely
the
same
situation
would
not
be.
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
you're
simply
reading
that
much
too
broadly
from
our
cases.
i
don't
think
our
cases
have
said
there
is
any
general
duty
to
deal
in
a
specially
fair
way
with
indians,
as
opposed
to
other
citizens,
unless
you're
talking
about
the
interpretation
of
a
treaty
or
the
duty
to
deal
with
trust
lands.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suggest
that
you
take
a
look
at
our
opinion
in
cherokee
nation
where
we
say,
"the
trust
responsibility
is
implicated
only
where
the
indian
property
is
at
stake.
"
mr.
jasperse,
i
thought
that
the
apa
itself
exempted
it
from
notice
and
comment.
even
if
you
assume
that
the
letter
in...
at
issue
was
a
rule...
and
i'm
not
sure
it
was,
but
if
you
assume
that,
it
exempts
general
statements
of
policy
from
any
notice
and
comment
requirement.
and
at
best
you
would
consider
the
letter
just
a
statement
of
policy,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jasperse.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
