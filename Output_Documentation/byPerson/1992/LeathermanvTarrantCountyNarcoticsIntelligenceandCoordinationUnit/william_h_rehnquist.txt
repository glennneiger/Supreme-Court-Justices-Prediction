we'll

argument
now
in
no.
91-1657,
charlene
leatherman
v.
tarrant
county
narcotics
intelligence
and
coordination
unit.
mr.
gladden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rule
20(a)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
provide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
a
motion
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
is
there
some
indication
or
do
you
believe,
i...
do
you
think
the
district
judge
would
have
allowed
you
the
discovery
that
he
previously
didn't
allow
you
if
he
had
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
know,
one
of
the
things
you're
telling
us
about
is
how
you
couldn't
get
any
information
through
discovery,
and
i'm
wondering
how
that
is
related
to
the
heightened
pleading
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
perhaps
your
answer
to
my
question
should
be
yes,
that
had
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss,
it
would
have
been
more
lenient
about
allowing
discovery.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
heightened
pleading
rule
where
you're
dealing
with
individuals
who
will
claim
qualified
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
anderson?
justice
o'connor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
scalia.
and
so,
you
think
that
anderson
requires
what
answer
to
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
discovery
in
a
case
would
be
only
limited
to
facts
bearing
on
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
but
when
i
say
a
case
like--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that,
i
meant
one
where
there
are
individuals
involved
who
can
claim
qualified--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
issue
before
this
court
about
collateral
estoppel,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
very
well,
mr.
gladden.
mr.
ringle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ringle,
this
is
a
fairly
elaborate
heightened
pleading
requirement
that
you're
suggesting.
and
i
would
think
that
perhaps
before,
in
our
deliberations,
we
got
to
what
the
content
of
such
a
requirement
should
be,
we
would
get
to
whether
it's
authorized
at
all
under
the
rules
in
view
of
the
plain
statement
language
in
rule
8
and
the
fact
that
certainly
some
sort
of
expressio
unius
argument
derives
from
the
fraud
and
mistake
special
pleading
requirement
in
rule
9.
i
hope
fairly
soon
in
your
argument,
you
will
address
that,
what
i
see
as
a
kind
of
a
preceding
question
to
the
content
of
a
heightened
pleading
requirement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
would
really
be
opening
a
big
door
if
we
bought
that
argument
because
every
defendant
in
the
country
would
be
here
saying
that
we
have
a
right
not
to
be
held
liable
just
on
an
allegation
of
negligence.
i
mean,
almost
every
tort
action
in
the
country
you
could
find
some
reason
to
say
that
it
should
be
more
specifically
pleaded
than
rule
8
requires
or
we'll
be
deprived
of
a
substantive
right,
to
wit,
the
right
to
keep
our
money
until
we're
found
liable
by
a
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
your
client,
which
is
a
municipal
corporation,
more
entitled
to
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
than
a
railroad
such
as
we
heard
this
morning...
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
at
a
crossing
accident?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ringle,
take
paragraph
25
of
one
of
these
complaints
which
appears
on
page
39
of
the
tan
appendix,
and
reading
midway
through
that,
the
allegation
is
that
defendant
city
of
lake
worth
failed
to
formulate
and
implement
an
adequate
policy
to
train
its
officers
on
the
proper
manner
in
which
to
respond
when
confronted
by
family
dogs.
why
is
that
deficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
under
the
approach
you've
been
talking
about,
why
is
that
deficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
it
lack?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
your
complaint
was
that
to
go
further
and
hold
a
municipality,
you
have
to
allege
a
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
they
allege
a
policy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
thing
has
no
basis
in
fact,
that's
not
a
pleading
problem.
that's
either
a
discovery
problem,
a
summary
judgment
problem,
or
a
trial
problem.
there
are
all
sorts
of
complaints
that
comply
fully
with
rule
8
that
have
no
basis
in
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ringle.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
gladden,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please
do
so.
the
case
is
submitted.
