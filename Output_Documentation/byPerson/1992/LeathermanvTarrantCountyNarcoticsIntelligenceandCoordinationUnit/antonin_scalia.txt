justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gladden,
can
i
ask
you,
is
there...
what
in
the
federal
rules,
if
anything...
and
if
your
theory
is
adopted...
would
prevent
a
plaintiff
routinely,
whenever
there
has
been
any
malfeasance
on
the
part
of
a
police
officer,
for
example,
to
file
a
lawsuit
claiming
that
it
is
a
policy
of
the
city?
you
know,
the
policeman
shoots
a
fleeing
miscreant
who's
committed
a
misdemeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
just
file
a
complaint
saying
this
is
a
policy
of
the
city
and
then
it
can't
be
dismissed
on
the
pleadings,
so
you
get
to
the
summary
judgment
stage.
but
you're
entitled
to
discovery
for
summary
judgment.
so,
in
other
words,
you
don't
really
know
when
you
file
the
suit
that
you
have
a
proper
cause
of
action,
and
you're
using
the
suit
as
a
means
of
investigation,
which
doesn't
seem
to
me
is
proper.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
stops
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
only
applies
to
the
facts
that
are
asserted
in
the
complaint,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
means
the
facts
pleaded.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to
find
something
in
that
reasonable
investigation?
suppose
i
do
a
reasonable
investigation
and
i
cannot
identify
any
municipal
policy,
but
i
still
file
the
lawsuit.
have
i
complied
with
rule
11?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
keep
attributing
this
to
me.
this
was
the
court
that
said
this.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
always
speak
for
the
whole
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
often...
i
often
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
basis
for
the
knowledge,
information,
or
belief
in
this
case
that
this
was
a
municipal
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
show
a
policy.
i
mean,
it
just
shows--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ringle,
you
keep
referring
to
this
as
immunity
from
liability.
it's
a
strange
way
to
put
it.
the
fact
is
the
city
is
simply
not
liable
unless
you
prove
a
certain
thing.
i
guess
you
can
call
that
immunity
from
liability,
but
it
certainly
is
not...
it
certainly
is
not...
immunity
from
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
not
a
protection
from
suit.
they
can
be
sued
till
the
cows
come
home.
it's
a
protection
against
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
happens
all
the
time,
that
people
have
to
defend
suits
which
turn
out
to
be
baseless.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you're
saying
municipalities
are
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
case
comes
down
to.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
should
have
been
in
rule
9
then.
i
mean,
you
know,
rule
9
could
have
read
pleading
special
matters,
a,
municipalities.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say,
you
know,
when
there's
a
municipality,
you
have
to
plead
everything.
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
sitting
around
in
lawn
chairs
drinking
beer,
as
i
got
it.
