mr.
richard
gladden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
challenge
what's
known
as
the
fifth
circuit's
heightened
pleading
requirement,
which
that
court
applies
in
civil
rights
cases
brought
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.,
section
1983
with
respect
to
allegations
against
local
governmental
entities
wherein
plaintiffs
allege
that
the
local
governmental
entity
has
failed
to
adequately
train,
allegations
similar
to
those
presented
in
city
of
canton
v.
harris.
it's
the
petitioners'
contention
that
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
violates
the
system
of
notice
pleading
set
out
in
rule
8(a)(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
alternatively,
to
the
extent
that
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
is
permissible
under
rule
8,
petitioners
go
further
and
state
that
they
believe
that
that
violates
the
rule's
enabling
act,
title
28
u.s.c.,
section
2072(b).
before
going
much
further,
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
for
the
court
the
procedural
and
factual
background
which
led
to
this
case.
the
case
originally
arose
out
of
a
search
of
the
leatherman
residence
which
occurred
in
may
of
1989.
in
that
case,
governmental
officers,
under
the
control
of
the
tarrant
county
narcotics
task
force,
secured
a
search
warrant
for
their
premises
and
upon
entering
the
premises
shot
and
killed
two
of
their
dogs,
and
after
discovering,
just
within
moments,
that
there
was
no
narcotics
laboratory
within
the
premises,
proceeded
to
lounge
about
in
the
front
of
the
yard,
basically
just
kind
of
enhancing
and
aggravating
the
anxiety
that
the
family
was
already
experiencing.
mrs.
leatherman
and
her
son
travis
were
there
on
the
premises
at
the
time
the
dogs
were
shot...
or
at
the
end
of
the
driveway,
some
100
feet
away.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
in
state
court
pursuant
to
section
1983
alleging
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
the
manner
in
which
the
search
was
conducted
by
the
officers
and
the
shooting
of
their
dogs,
which
they
considered
to
be
an
unreasonable
seizure
of
their
effect,
the
dog
being
the
effect
in
question.
the
petitioner...
the
leatherman
petitioners'
former
counsel
filed
the
case
in
state
court
and
was
unable,
prior
to
filing
it
in
state
court,
to
get
access
to
any
documents
to
identify
the
individual
officers.
he
made
numerous
attempts
to
try
to
secure
documents
which
would
more
particularly
describe
what
customs
they
may
have
and
what
prior
incidents
might
have
occurred
similar
to
this.
he
was
unable
to
do
so.
following
the
filing
of
his
complaint
and
our
petition
in
state
court,
the
respondents
immediately
removed
the
case
to
federal
court,
and
immediately
thereafter
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
12(b)
or
for
summary
judgment.
the
petitioner...
the
leatherman
petitioners'
former
counsel
had
not
been
admitted
to
practice
in
federal
court
and
while
he
was
trying
to
locate
other
counsel
to
handle
the
case,
the
court
initially
acted
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
dismissed
the
case.
following
my
becoming
involved
in
the
case,
i
moved
the
court
to
vacate
the
dismissal
and
allow
the
petitioners
to
replea
their
complaint,
if
possible
to
conform
to
the
technical
pleading
requirements
that
the
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
courts
in
the
fifth
circuit
apply,
specifically
the
heightened
pleading
requirement.
during
the
course
in
time
in
which
we
were
drafting
the
amended
complaint,
our
office
became
aware
of
another
incident
also
involving
the
tarrant
county
drug
task
force
wherein
the
officers
had
displayed
similar
lack
of
supervision
with
respect
to
the
entry
of
the
residence
unannounced,
clubbing
of
an
elderly
gentleman,
remaining
on
the
premises
some
hour
and
a
half
to
2
hours
after
determining
that
there
was
no
drugs
on
the
premises
or
drug
laboratory
on
the
premises.
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
consistent
pattern
there,
and
for
that
reason,
pursuant
to
20(a),
rule
20(a),
i
added
this
separate
incident,
together
with
the
leathermans'
lawsuit.
mr.
richard
gladden
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
gladden
chief
justice,
if
i
recollect,
it
says
that
you
have
a
common
transaction
in
question
element.
if
you
have
a
pattern
of
actions
by
the
same
identified
source
and
you
have
common
legal
questions
or
common
factual
questions,
the
rules
permit
a
joinder
of
what
would
otherwise
seem
to
be
separate
incidences
if
you
have
a
common
factual
question
or
a
common
legal
question.
mr.
richard
gladden
well,
it
was...
we
just
amended
the
complaint.
i
know
the
district
court
was
uncertain
at
the
time
it
acted
or
entered
its
decision
as
to
what
legal
authority.
the
issue
had
never
been
raised
by
the
respondents,
and
therefore
it
had
never
been
briefed.
in
any
event,
following
the
amended
complaint
being
filed,
the
respondent,
tcnicu,
who
i'll
just
call
the
drug
task
force,
filed
virtually
the
identical
motion
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment,
and
at
that
time
attached
some
unverified
police
reports
and
such
like
that
that
allowed
us
to
get
a
little
bit
more
information,
but
still
not
enough
to
recognize
on
an
evidentiary
basis
sufficient
facts
to
perhaps
defend
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
at
that
time,
i
filed
a
motion
to
stay
action
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
pursuant
to
rule
56(f)
because
there
had
not
been
sufficient
discovery
from
my
position
to
feel
comfortable
with
the
court
acting
on
it
at
that
time,
and
that
was
also
briefed
in
the
district
court
in
response
to
their
motion
for
summary
judgment.
in
response...
discovery
or
motion
for...
excuse
me...
production
of
documents,
the
respondent
drug
task
force
filed
a
motion
for
a
protective
order,
and
they
claimed,
i
believe,
four
different
privileges,
including
executive
privilege,
why
they
shouldn't
have
to
disclose
any
documents
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
their
drug
task
force.
as
a
result,
the
court,
the
district
court,
entered
a
protective
order
and
prevented
me
from
getting
any
other
documents
other
than
those
voluntarily
provided
by
the
drug
task
force.
some...
and
i
had
also
asked
for
a
hearing
on
that,
and
the
hearing
was
denied.
some
3
weeks
later,
the
court
granted
their
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
the
heightened
pleading
requirement,
but
went
further
and
acted
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and,
however,
on
appeal
the
fifth
circuit
only
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
heightened
pleading
requirement.
that
pretty
much
concludes
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case.
it's
the
petitioners'
position
that
there
are
several
reasons
why
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
is
inconsistent
with
the
notice
pleading
that
this
court
set
out
in
conley
v.
gibson.
in
conley
v.
gibson,
the
court
said
that
fair...
that
a
plaintiff
under
rule
8...
and
that
was
yet
again
a
case
where
the
people,
the
respondents,
had
said
that
you
had
to
have
specific
allegations
to
support
your
claims,
and
the
court
in
response
to
that
said
that
under
rule
8
a
plaintiff
only
need
show
fair
notice
of
their
claim
and
the
grounds
upon
which
it
rests.
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
the
respondent
certainly
had
fair
notice
of
both
the
legal
and
factual
basis
of
the
claim
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
allegation
and
certainly
had
an
understanding
that
the
theory
of
relief
was
pursuant
to
city
of
canton
v.
harris.
they
were
so
able
to
understand
the
allegations
that
they
were
able
to
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
however,
they
didn't
provide
any
documentation
with
respect
to
what
their
training
was
or
whether
there
had
been
prior
incidences.
yet
again,
because
the
protective
order
had
been
entered,
i
was
unable
to
get
such
documents.
it's
our
position
that
not
only
does
rule
8
and
conley
v.
gibson
preclude
any
understanding
of
rule
8
to
allow
a
heightened
pleading
requirement,
but
we
also
believe
that
rule
9(b)
certainly
read
in
harmony
with
rule
8
would
negate
the
possibility
of
a
heightened
pleading
requirement.
mr.
richard
gladden
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
richard
gladden
that
would
be
just
speculation.
mr.
richard
gladden
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
denied
the
discovery,
and
it's
my
impression
that
he
denied
the
discovery
on
the
basis
that
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
foreclosed
the
lawsuit
proceeding
further
to
discovery
because
under
a
heightened
pleading
requirement,
you
wouldn't
be
allowed
discovery
unless
you
could
get
through
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
richard
gladden
i
certainly
think
so.
i
think
in
the
absence
of
a
heightened
pleading
requirement,
he
would
have
been
more
lenient.
most
of
the
case
law
that
he
cited
in
support
of
denying
discovery
was
connected
or
intertwined
with
cases
involving
the
heightened
pleading
requirement.
back
to
rule
9(b),
another
suggestion
we
have
or
argument
we
have
is
that
9(b)
sets
out
what
kinds
of
claims
there
are
that
require
particularity
in
pleading
complaints.
it's
limited
to
fraud
and
mistake.
nowhere
is
there
any
mention
of
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
for
civil
rights
cases
or
some
unidentified
other
class
of
cases.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
allegations
involving
knowledge,
malice,
intent,
or
other
condition
of
mind,
which
i
think
in
this
case
deliberate
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
municipal
policymaker
would
certainly
be
a
condition
of
mind...
rule
9(b)
says
that
only
general
allegations
are
required
with
respect
to
pleading.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
throughout
this
litigation,
both
the
respondents
and
the
lower
courts,
not
necessarily
judge
goldberg,
but
they
have
concluded...
or
they
have
confused
the
difference
between
a
rule
for
summary
judgment
where
evidence
has
to
be
pled
and
presented
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
where
you
are
only
required
to
give
fair
notice
of
the
claim
that
you're
presenting.
i
would
say
again
the
respondents
in
this
case
had
fair
notice
of
what
the
factual
basis
of
the
constitutional
allegation
was,
and
they
had
fair
notice,
at
least
to
my
ability
to
plead
it,
that
we
were
challenging
the
inadequacy
of
their
training
and
that
we
believed,
on
information
and
belief,
that
there
were
other
incidences
that
would
support
our
claim.
justice
scalia
has,
on
more
than
one
occasion,
stated
that
we
should
apply
the
text
to
the
rules
and
not
improve
upon
them.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lower
courts
who
have
imposed
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
have
done
so
in
an
effort
to
improve
upon
what
they
consider
to
be
a
problem
with
the
federal
rules
in
protecting
municipalities.
the
city
of
owen...
or
owen
v.
city
of
independence
addressed
the
question
of
whether
municipalities
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
and
the
court
ruled
that
it
wasn't.
this
heightened
pleading
requirement
originally
derived
out
of
the
need
to
protect
individual
defendants
who
had
a
right
to
assert
qualified
immunity
from
broad
ranging
discovery.
i
don't
think
that
there's
necessarily
a
problem
with
limiting
broad
ranging
discovery
in
any
case
under
rule
16.
i
think
a
district
judge
certainly
could
isolate
issues
and
allow
discovery
to
go
forward
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
gladden
well,
i
don't
think
that...
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
presented
to
the
court,
but
i
would
take
the
position
in
anderson
v.
creighton,
justice
scalia
noted
that
when
you
do
have
issues
of
fact
involved,
that
you
can
have
discovery
limited
to
the
fact
issue
involved
go
forward.
and
that
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
qualified
immunity.
mr.
richard
gladden
no.
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
gladden
i
think
anderson
would
suggest
that
qualified
immunity
or
not
would...
there
is
no
need
for
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
or
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
apply
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
at
the
same
time
that
you
said
before
that
you
could
allow
discovery
to
go
forward
where
qualified
immunity
has
been
raised,
only
limited
to
the
specific
issue.
that
way
we
could
eliminate
this
threat
or
exaggerated
threat
of
over-ranging
and
overbroad
discovery.
mr.
richard
gladden
in
the
district
courts...
well,
now,
for
local
governmental
entities,
they
don't--
mr.
richard
gladden
--okay.
yes,
okay.
mr.
richard
gladden
oh,
certainly.
i
think
that
would
be
in
the
district
court's
discretion,
and
certainly
he
would
have
discretion
to
do
so.
and
i
wouldn't
be
here
to
argue
to
the
contrary.
mr.
richard
gladden
that's
correct.
and
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
that
issue...
siegart
v.
gilley
i
believe
was
going
to
address
that,
and
i
recall
your
concurring
opinion.
the
court
didn't
reach
that
issue
in
siegart
v.
gilley,
and
that
is
not
presented
in
this
case
although
i
recognize
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
may
have
some
bearing
on
a
subsequent
case
that
would
address
that
issue.
mr.
richard
gladden
it's
their
position
that
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
is
a
substantive
form
of
immunity.
we
take
the
contrary
position.
we
don't
believe...
we
think
that
owen
v.
city
of
independence
disposed
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
local
governmental
entities
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
by
allowing
a
cause
of
action
to
exist
under
section
1983,
that
disposes
of
any
absolute
immunity.
and
so,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
or
not
the
limitations
on
discovery
should
be
addressed
through
a
limitation,
like
a
rule
56(f)
motion,
whether
or
not...
or
rule
16
limitation
on
discovery
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
not
at
the
initial
pleading
stage
because
rule
8
expressly
was
intended
to
only
provide
fair
notice
to
defendants
in
these
cases.
unless
there's
a
legitimate
claim
of
not
having
notice,
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
impose
this
pleading
requirement,
and
in
this
case,
no
one
filed
a
motion
for
more
definite
statement
because
in
my
view
there
was
never
any
question
about
notice
involved.
mr.
richard
gladden
i
think
there's--
mr.
richard
gladden
--okay,
well--
mr.
richard
gladden
--yes.
i'll
respond
to
that
by
saying,
first
of
all,
we
do
have
rule
11,
which
imposes
upon
plaintiff's
counsel
an
obligation
to
make
a
reasonable
inquiry
into
a
prefiling
investigation
into
the
facts
and
law.
mr.
richard
gladden
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
they
have
to
plead
the
facts,
but
it
says
they
do
have
an
obligation
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
into
the
facts.
and--
mr.
richard
gladden
--well,
not
necessarily.
you
can
have
someone
fail
to
do
a
reasonable
investigation
and
have
a
boiler
plate
allegation
like
you
have,
or
you
could
have
someone
who
had
done
a
reasonable
investigation.
the
threat
of
sanctions
would
foreclose
some--
mr.
richard
gladden
--i
don't
think
you
would
necessarily
have
to
find
something,
but
you'd
have
to
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
discovery
would
bring
forth
factual
specifics
to
support
your
claim.
i
believe
you've
said
in
lujan
v.
defenders
of
wildlife
and
in
another
case
also
involving
lujan--
mr.
richard
gladden
--okay.
mr.
richard
gladden
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
richard
gladden
but
under
12(b)(6),
general
allegations,
unlike
a
summary
judgment
motion...
under
12(b)(6)
general
allegations
are
presumed
to
have
particular
facts
supporting
them.
i
think
that
it
would
certainly
be
sanctionable
conduct
for
someone,
without
conducting
a
reasonable
prefiling
investigation,
to
just
without
doing
an
investigation
file
a
boiler
plate
complaint
and
then
cause
it
to
go
forward
to
the
summary
judgment
motion
stage.
i
think
that
someone
would
have
a
good
argument
to
file
for
sanctions.
then
again,
we
would
have
a
very
limited
amount
of
litigation
involved
where
the
sanctions
would
not
be
that
enormous,
and
you
would
have
to
impose
sanctions
limited
to
the
specific
event
that
caused,
as
the
court
has
said
in
the
rule
11
cases.
mr.
richard
gladden
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
he
did
everything
reasonably...
every
reasonable
effort
to
discover...
in
this
case,
we
had
naturally
an
intelligence
organization,
by
the
very
name,
who
were
very
secretive
of
the
information
they
had
in
their
files
and
elsewhere.
rule
9(b),
of
course,
does
isolate
two
cases
for
mistake
and
fraud,
but
you'd
have
to
have
particular
allegations.
we
think
it's
different
in
this
case
because
in
fraud
cases
you're
going
to
have
a
course
of
dealing
and
you're
going
to
have
some
reliance
of
the
person
who's
the
victim
of
the
fraud.
mistake
would
be
similar.
that's
a
different
category.
a
case
like
this,
you've
got
agents
of
a
local
governmental
entity
who
are
causing
damage
to
the
victim
and
then
because
we
don't
have
respondeat
superior,
we've
got
the
supervisors
or
the
policymaker
somewhere
else.
and
the
victims
themselves
never
have...
necessarily
have
direct
contact
with
the
policymakers.
and
that's
why
we
have
a
problem
in
the
absence
of
respondeat
superior,
which
of
course
we
don't
have.
mr.
richard
gladden
it
had
been
my
experience...
mostly
a
lot
of
rumors,
of
course.
we
did
have
these
two
incidences
that
are
about
3
and
a
half
months
apart
with
officers
remaining
on
the
premises
for
some
2
hours
after
determining
there
was
no
drugs
or
contraband
on
the
premises,
the
shooting
of
the
dogs,
which
certainly
disclosed...
the
location
of
the
dogs
was
such
that
it
indicated
that
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
be
shooting
the
dogs.
mr.
richard
gladden
well,
of
course,
there
was
a
statement
that
was
made
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
mrs.
leatherman,
by
one
of
the
officers.
why
did
you
shoot
my
dog?
standard
procedure,
lady.
okay?
now,
he
didn't
say...
you
know,
as
judge
goldberg
noted
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
doesn't
indicate
under
what
circumstance
the
procedure
allowed
them
to
shoot
dogs,
but
it
did
create
the
inference
in
my
mind
and
certainly
in
her
mind
that
it
was
completely
unreasonable,
the
manner
in
which
they
executed
their
dogs.
that
was...
that's
part,
but
not
all
of
the
inference
that
was
created
in
my
mind.
is
it
relevant
too
that
you
had
a...
i
don't
know
the
number,
but
you
had
a
multiplicity
of
officers
here...
i
don't
know
how
many
there
were...
as
opposed
simply
to
one
officer?
if
one
officer
goes
in
and
shoots
the
dog,
i
suppose
you
can't
draw
much
of
an
inference
from
that.
but
if
10
are
participating
in
what
seems
to
you
to
be
outrageous
conduct,
that
is
more
probative,
isn't
it,
on
the
face
of
it
that
there's
something
more
than
just
individualized
caprice
at
work
here?
i
certainly
think
that
would
add
to
it.
i
know
there's
a
first
circuit
case...
i
forget
the
name
of
it...
that
actually
has
applied
that
theory,
that
when
you
have
a
number
of
officers
together,
like
in
a
rodney
king
incident,
for
instance,
there's...
to
have
an
isolated
act
by
one
officer
is
completely
different
than
to
have
15
officers
out
there
hanging
around
for
2
hours
drinking
beer,
shooting
people's
dogs,
using
obscene
language
towards
the
plaintiffs.
i
think
certainly
that
should
be
considered
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
there
was
a
lack
of
supervision.
mr.
richard
gladden
yes,
but
i
think
for
future
plaintiffs
that
have
to
file
these
cases,
it's
going
to
excruciating
for
them
to
determine
how
the
court
has
ruled
and
what's
going
to
be
specific
enough
or
particular
enough.
and
i
think
that
really
we
ought
to
just
interpret
the
rules
as
they're
written
and
not
stretch
the
rules
to
try
to
incorporate,
outside
of
the
rules'
enabling
act,
a
particularity
in
the
pleading
requirement
under
section
1983.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
policy
oriented
decision
that
shouldn't
be
made
by
the
court.
it
should
be
made
through
the
rules'
enabling
act
if
it's
going
to
be
made.
mr.
richard
gladden
it
was...
our
allegation
was
more
or
less
loosely
patterned
on
tennessee
v.
garner.
mr.
richard
gladden
it
was
a
failure
to
train.
it
was
a
failure
to--
mr.
richard
gladden
--okay.
i
interpreted
the
failure
to
train
cases,
such
as
city
of
canton
v.
harris,
as
being
another
way
of
pleading
a
policy
under
section
1983.
mr.
richard
gladden
okay.
i
can
elaborate
if
you'd
like.
our
allegation
was
is
that
we
identified
who
we
knew
to
be
the
policymaker.
we
felt
like
the
policy
with
respect
to
the
shooting
of
dogs
and
under
what
circumstances
it
was
reasonable
to
be
shooting
dogs
reflected
or
evidenced
a
deliberate
indifference
by
the
policymaker
which
had
resulted
or
caused...
was
a
substantial
factor
or
cause
in
the
constitutional
violation
that
had
been
visited
upon
the
plaintiffs
by
the
agents
of
the
governmental
entity.
mr.
richard
gladden
yes,
that's
correct,
as
well
as
an
allegation
of
who
the
policymaker
was
and
causation
and
under
color
of
law.
mr.
richard
gladden
the
district
court
did.
mr.
richard
gladden
yes,
the
district
court
did.
mr.
richard
gladden
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
gladden
no.
i
don't
believe
that
had
been
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
gladden
i
believe
so,
certainly.
however,
with
respect
to
the
collateral
estoppel,
i
would
mention
that
the
case,
andert
v.
bewley,
which
is
referred
to
by
the
respondents,
is
currently
on
appeal.
the
verdict
in
that
case
did
not
address
the
constitutional
violations.
so,
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
different
than
city
of
los
angeles
v.
heller.
that
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
constitutional
violation
had
actually
been
acted
upon
or
a
decision
had
been
rendered
by
the
court.
that
has
not
occurred
here.
the
officers
in
question...
2
of
the
officers
of
the
15
that
were
sued,
the
2
officers
in
andert
v.
bewley...
well,
first
of
all,
only
2
of
the
officers
there.
secondly,
they
were
let
out
of
the
lawsuit
on
the
basis
of
qualified
immunity
under
the--
mr.
richard
gladden
--well,
i
believe
it
was
raised
in
terms
of
mootness.
some
people
can
construe
it
as
collateral
estoppel
and
some
people
construe
it
as
mootness.
i
know
city
of
los
angeles
v.
heller
dealt
with
it
in
terms
of
mootness.
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
moot
in
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
different
defendants
and
several
other
reasons
why
i
think
that's
not
applicable.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
gladden
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
we've
pretty
much
covered
everything
there
is
to
cover.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'm
prepared
to
go
ahead
and
stop
at
this
point.
