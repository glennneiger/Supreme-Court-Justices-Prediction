justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
the
significance
under
rule
11
be
in
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
did
all
the
prefiling
investigation
he
could
do
and
just
couldn't
find
out
anything?
i
think
that's
what
you
are
saying
happened
in
this
case.
and
yet,
based
on
the
behavior
of
the
police
officers,
he
thinks
there's
at
least
a
reasonable
possibility
that
there
was
a
policy
of
inadequate
training
and
so
on.
so,
he
goes
ahead
and
files
based
upon
generalized
allegations
and
then
hopes
for
discovery.
would
there
be
a
rule
11
sanction
imposable
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
in
any
case,
in
theory
you
could
win
this
case
and
still
leave
open
the
question
as
to
whether
the...
an
allegation
of
unreasonable
conduct
against
one
officer
in
one
incident
would
be
sufficient
under
rule--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
beyond
the
policy
reasons
that
you
have
given
us
for
your
yes
answer,
is
there
any
textual
basis
in
the
rules
for
a
yes
answer
because
we're
considering
a
question
under
the
rules?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
don't...
may
i
just
start
with
the
contrast
between
8
and
9?
8
and
9,
in
effect,
sets
up
a
kind
of
a
dichotomy:
a
plain
statement
in
8,
statement
with
particularity
in
cases
of
fraud
and
mistake
in
9.
the
chief
justice
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
the...
that
rule
9
sets
up
a
kind
of
exclusio
alterius
argument.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
suggesting
that
on
your
sort
of
analysis
that
this
case
is
involving
a
kind
of
municipal
immunity,
that
the
immunity
is
being
abrogated
by
the
failure
to
demand
the
heightened
pleading.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
what
do
you
do
about
anderson
and
creighton?
so,
that
must
have
been
wrongly
decided.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
anderson
and
creighton
assumes
that
before
the
resolution
of
the
immunity
issue,
there
may
be
some
discovery.
does
anderson
and
creighton,
therefore,
imply
that
there
is
an
abrogation
of
the
substantive
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
anderson
and
creighton
doesn't
imply
that,
why
would
it
be
implied
by
a
rule
of
pleading
or
the
recognition
of
a
rule
of
pleading
here
that
may
allow
some
discovery
of
fact,
i.e.,
leading...
prior
to
and
leading
to
summary
judgment
before
you
resolve
what
you
refer
to
as
the
immunity
to
any
municipal
liability
beyond
respondeat
superior?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
isn't
the
answer
to
that
impose
rule
11
sanctions?
don't
impose
pleading
requirements
that
aren't
in
the
pleading
rules.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
seem
to
be
positing
in
a
rhetorical
way
a
full-blown
trial.
i
presume
these
kinds
of
issues
are
going
to
be
generally
resolvable,
if
resolvable
in
your
favor
they
may
be,
on
summary
judgment.
