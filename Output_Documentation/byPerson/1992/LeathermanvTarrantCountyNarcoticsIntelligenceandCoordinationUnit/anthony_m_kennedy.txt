justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--now,
i
take
it...
maybe
i'm
wrong.
is
it
correct
that
you're
going
to
go
on
to
say
that
qualified
immunity
is
not
involved
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
municipality's
claim
here
just
characterized
as
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
the
complaint
was
deficient
under
rule
8?
the
court
of
appeals
invoked
the
heightened
pleading
requirement,
did
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
i
think
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
it's
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
that's
the
defect
in
the
pleading.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
your
rule
11
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
rule
11
doesn't
inform
rules
8
and
9.
it
works
the
other
way
around.
rule
11
is
a
certification
that
you've
complied
with
rules
8
and
9.
that's
all
it
is.
it's
a
very
surprising
contention
to
me
that
by
enacting
rule
11,
it
was
intended
to
alter
or
modify
rules
8
and
9.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
that's
the
issue,
whether
or
not
rules
8
or
9
are
complied
with.
and
you
refer
to
the
city
as
having
an
immunity.
i
thought
our
owen
case
indicated
that
it
does
not.
the
city
doesn't
have
an
immunity.
it
just
has
non...
it
just
has
a
defense
against
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
true
if
there
had
been
respondeat
superior,
there
would
be
no
need
to
sue
the
city
for
negligent
training.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
given
the
fact
that
there
is
no
respondeat
superior
liability,
the
court
has
said
that
the
city
is
directly
liable
for
failure
of
training.
so,
it's
not
an
immunity.
