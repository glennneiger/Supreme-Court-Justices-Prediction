mr.
brett
a.
ringle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
in
this
case,
various
municipalities
in
tarrant
county,
ask
that
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion...
judgment
be
affirmed,
and
that
this
court
embrace
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
in
cases
arising
under
section
1983
against
municipalities
alleging
that
officers
have
not
been
properly
trained
or
what
has
been
known
as
failure
to
train
cases.
this
is
especially
critical
in
cases
against
municipalities.
until
and
unless
there
is
a
demonstration
of
a
municipal
policy
at
issue,
the
case
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
an
allegation
of
vicarious
liability
for
which
municipalities
are
not
and
have
never
been
liable
either
at
the
common
law
or
under
1983.
this
court
has
consistently
reaffirmed
that
proposition,
having
stated
in
monell
that
municipalities
may
not
be
sued
under
a
theory
of
respondeat
superior.
this
case
is
more
than
just
a
monell
case.
this
case
is
actually
governed
by
city
of
canton
v.
harris.
in
a
failure
to
train
case,
the
heightened
pleading
requirement
we
submit
should
contain
three
requirements.
first,
the
plaintiff
should
be
required
to
allege
a
clearly
established
constitutional
violation
for
without
such
an
allegation,
there
is,
indeed,
no
policy.
this
is
not
a
case
like
monell
where
all
the
plaintiff
should
have
to
demonstrate
is
the
presence
of
a
policy
of
the
municipality
and
that
policy
caused
harm.
by
definition,
in
a
case
like
this,
there
is
no
policy
unless
there
is
deliberate
indifference.
it
is
only
when
a
failure
to
train
arises
to
the
level
of
deliberate
indifference
that
a
policy,
which
is
actionable
under
1983,
has
even
been
identified.
secondly,
the
plaintiff
should
be
required
to
plead
sufficient
facts
to
indicate
a
pattern
of
similar
allegedly
unconstitutional
acts.
more
than
a
single
act
is
clearly
necessary
for
liability,
as
this
court
has
taught
us
in
oklahoma
city
v.
tuttle.
similarly,
a
failure
to
train
case
at
bottom
is
a
case
alleging
that
municipal
policymakers
responsible
for
the
training
of
police
officers
have
not
responded
to
a
concern
or
a
problem
of
which
they
have
notice.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
first,
rule
8
has
been
represented
not
in
the
terms
that
it's
written.
i
think
the
petitioners
want
the
court
to
put
the
word
notice
as
the
only
requirement
of
rule
8.
rule
8
is
more
than
a
requirement
of
giving
factual
notice.
rule
8
requires
notice
of
a
claim.
so,
even
if
you
have
a
case
where
all
of
the
facts
that
could
conceivably
be
known
are
laid
out...
in
essence,
there
is
attached
to
the
pleading,
as
an
exhibit,
a
videotape
which
contains
every
fact
upon
which
the
claim
is
asserted...
rule
8
is
still
not
met
unless
it
states
a
claim.
for
example,
let's
use
the
pleading
in
this
case
as
an
example.
i
suggest
that
the
pleading
in
this
case
is
nothing
more
than
a
case
of
individual
responsibility
of
an
officer
to
which
is
attached
a
boiler
plate
allegation
that
there
is
failure
to
train
and
deliberate
indifference.
nothing
more
is
alleged.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
the
court
did
not
address
that
question.
rule
8--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--yes,
that's
correct.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
for
there
to
be
a
claim
stated,
under
city
of
canton
v.
harris,
there
has
to
be
a
policy
present,
and
unless
there's
some
basis
to
suggest
that
there
is
deliberate
indifference,
it
doesn't
even
state
a
policy.
deliberate
indifference
in
a
city
of
canton
v.
harris
case
is
part
of
the
definition
of
a
policy
unlike
in
other
cases
against
municipalities.
and
as...
rule
8
is
not
controlling
in
a
situation
if
what
that
procedural
rule
permits
would
violate
a
substantive
right.
and
i
believe
the
right
of
a
municipality
to
be
free
from
liability
for
what
is
nothing
more
than
a
respondeat
superior
or
vicarious
liability
theory
is
going
to
be
thwarted.
that
right
will
cease
to
exist
if
municipalities
must
defend
cases
where
on
the
bare
allegation
of
the
existence
of
a
policy
and
the
bare
allegation
of
deliberate
indifference,
the
municipality
must
defend
that
case.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
not
and
could
not
be
an
across-the-board
rule,
nor
do
i
suggest
that
it
should
be.
the
result--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--i
assure
you
i
won't
suggest
that
the
pattern
requirement
i'm
suggesting
has
anything
to
do
with
rico
as
an
analog
either.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
what
we
have
is
a
case
involving
intrusion
into
municipal
governmental
affairs.
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
others,
and
we
have
a
case
where
a
defendant
enjoys
an
immunity
from
liability
which,
as
this
court
has
reiterated
as
recently
as
this
morning,
also
involves
an
immunity
from
suit.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
same
factors--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--the
puerto
rico
aqueduct
case--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--no,
that's
correct.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
the
immunity
is
the
immunity
from
respondeat
superior
liability.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
that
was
an
immunity
which
i
think
was
recognized
at
the
common
law.
it
was
clearly
an
immunity
then
which
was
protected
in
monroe
v.
pate,
and
it
was
an
immunity
which
was
not
affected
by
this
court's
decision
in
monell.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
well,
that
is
our
problem.
the
complaint
alleges
nothing
more
than
that.
it
is
on
its
face--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that's
correct,
and
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
why
that
heightened
pleading
is
necessary
because
if
there
isn't
a
heightened
pleading
requirement,
we
get
what
we
have
in
this
case,
a
case
asserting
allegedly
unconstitutional
activities
by
police
officers
without
the
barest
determination
or
factual
support
that
it
is
pursuant
to
a
policy.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
well,
there
were
two
officers
perhaps
who
were
involved
in
the
shooting
of
the
dogs.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
that
i
do
not
know.
in
the
other
situation,
in
the
andert
case,
only
one
officer
is
involved.
multiple
officers,
of
course,
made
the
entry,
but
only
one
officer
was
alleged
to
have
actually
struck
mr.
andert.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
certainly
other
officers
were
present.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
well,
they
are
both
small
police
forces.
that
is--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--no,
not
in
either
situation.
i
would
suggest
that
if,
in
fact,
you
had
75
percent
of
the
police
force
involved
in
one
instance,
that
certainly
there
would
be
some
indication
there
it's
a
policy.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
absolutely.
if
we
have
a--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--i
don't
know
how
large
the
police
force
in
these
two
municipalities
are.
they
are
both...
one
of
them
is
a
fairly
good
size
municipality,
grapevine.
the
other,
lake
worth,
is
not
so
large.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
i
don't
know--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--the
population
of--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--grapevine
is
over
100,000.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
it
only
stated
that
there
was
a
failure
to
train.
there's
nothing--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
because
that
is
nothing
more
than
a
boiler
plate
assertion
of
the
conclusion,
and
under
rule
12,
certainly
the
facts
that
are
alleged
in
a
complaint
must
be--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--i
think
what
more
it
has
to
do
is
first
state
clearly
the
constitutional
violation,
and
we
have
two
different
circumstances
here.
secondly,
i
think
it
must
clearly
allege
that
the
conduct
engaged
in
was
conduct
engaged
in
by
officers
of
the
same
municipality,
and
there
must
be
some
allegation
that
the
first
incident
could
somehow,
as
a
factual
basis,
put
a
reasonable
policymaker
on
notice
that
the
first
incident
should
tell
you
that
there's
something
wrong
with
the
training
that
should
be
corrected
prior
to
the
first
incident.
this
gets
directly
to
what
the
problems
are
that
are
illustrated
in
this
complaint.
what
we
really
have
are
not
two
allegations
of
conduct
against
one
police
force.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
i
think
that
there
needs--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--precisely.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
i
think
that
something
beyond--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--yes.
my
answer
is
absolutely
yes.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
there
is
certainly
a
textual
basis
under
rule
11.
rule
11
does
not--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--only
to
an
extent.
rule
8
does
recognize
that
notice
pleading
is
sufficient,
but
rule
8
has
no
authority
behind
it
unless
that
authority
can
be
found
in
the
rule's
enabling
act.
the
rule's
enabling
act
specifically
provides
that
a
rule
of
procedure
cannot
be
used
to
abrogate
a
substantive
right.
now,
rule
9
sets
out
a
policy.
in
a
fraud
case,
for
example,
more
particularity
must
be
alleged.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
that
is
correct.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
no.
anderson--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
does
at
all.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
because
i
believe
that
rule
11
requires
more
than
a
plaintiff
to
just
have
done
an
investigation
and
have
found
nothing,
and
having
found
nothing,
that
plaintiff
is
then
free
to
allege
a
cause
of
action.
that's
not
what
rule
11
requires.
rule
11
requires
that
after
an
investigation,
the
pleader
has
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
claim
has
a
basis
in
fact.
and
absent
some
additional
pleading
which
would
establish
either
a
pattern
of
similar
behavior
that
would
put
a
policymaker
on
notice
or
absent
some
fact
that
would
show
deliberate
indifference
or
perhaps
a
fact
that
would
show
that
the
person
who
was
actually
responsible
for
providing
and
setting
up
the
policy
was
involved
in
the
illegal
act,
without
something
that
shows
that
the
municipality
is
involved
as
opposed
to
simply
being
a
case
dealing
with
a
wrongful
conduct
of
an
individual--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--the
problem
with
rule
11
sanctions
typically
is
they're
assessed
at
the
end
of
the
case,
and
if
in
fact
there's
an
immunity
or
protection
for
a
municipality
to
be
free
from
both
liability
and
suit
in
a
context
that
would
otherwise
allege
only
vicarious
liability,
it
seems
like
that
municipality
has
lost
the
benefit
of
that
immunity
if
they
must,
in
fact,
defend
the
suit
and
rely
on
rule
11
sanctions
down
the
road
after
the
municipality--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--has
gone
through
all
of
the
defense,
costs,
and
potentially
even
costs
of
settlement.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
well,
they
could
be
resolvable
on
summary
judgment
if
the--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--it's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say,
if
the
summary
judgment
is
something
that
is
ruled
on
prior
to
discovery.
the
district
court
relied
on
two
grounds.
first
was
the
complaint
was
dismissed
under
12(b)(6)
and
summary
judgment
was
granted.
contrary
to
what
the
petitioners
are
suggesting,
the
petitioners
before
the
amended
complaint
was
dismissed
had
access
to
all
of
the
information
that
would
have
solved
the
problems
they
have
here.
let
me
recount,
if
i
may,
the
problems
with
the
pleading--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--it
was
additional
discovery.
what
was
provided
to
the
plaintiffs
was
information
that
gave
a
clear
indication
of
which
police
forces
were
involved.
the
police--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--the
police--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--yes.
the
police
reports
signed
by
the
officers
and
identifying
the
conduct
engaged
in
were
provided,
and
indeed,
the
agreement
that
set
up
the
tarrant
county
narcotics
intelligent
coordination
unit
was
given
to
them.
that
is
key.
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
two
incidents
of
actions
by
the
same
municipality.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
the
complaint
was
dismissed
on
that
grounds
and
the
district
court
also,
as
an
alternative
ground
for
his
holding,
granted
summary
judgment.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
the
affirmance
was
based
on
the
dismissal
under
rule
12(b)(6).
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
yes,
it
is.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
that's--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
i
don't
think
it
did
alter
rules
8
or
9.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
even
if
the
protection
of
a
municipality
from
a
vicarious
liability
case
is
judged
to
be
predicated
upon
a
construction
of
section
1983,
and
the
fact
that
congress
in
enacting
the
ku
klux
klan
act
did
not
grant
a
claim
for
vicarious
liability,
the
result
i
suggest
is
the
same
as
whether
that
protection
from
suit
arises
from
an
actual
immunity.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
is
no
claim
stated
because
no
cause
of
action
was
ever
granted
to
sue
a
municipality
for
anything
other
than
a
case
in
which
its
policies
were
the
moving
factor
behind
allegedly
unconstitutional
actions
of
its
agents.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
well,
except
there
is
no--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--it's
directly
liable
for
failure
to
train,
but
not
for
negligence
in
doing
so.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
a
bare
allegation
of
negligence
should
suffice.
a
municipality
in
a
failure
to
train
case
is
liable
only
if
there
is
a
policy
amounting
to
failure
to
train,
and
there
is
a
policy
only
if
the
failure
to
train
was
consciously
indifferent.
it's
not
a
two-pronged
test.
it's
not
an
issue
of
is
there
a
policy
of
failure
to
train,
and
if
that's
answered
yes,
the
court
then
asks...
answers
the
question
was
failing
to
train
deliberately
indifferent.
the
test
set
out
by
this
court
in
city
of
canton
v.
harris
is
there
isn't
even
a
policy
unless
the
failure
to
train
amounts
to
deliberate
indifference
of
the
rights
of
those
with
whom
the
police
come
into
contact.
and
the
result
which
we
are
asking
this
court
for
i
think
is
also
counseled
by
the
court's
decision
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald.
yes,
that
was
a
case
involving
qualified
immunity,
but
i
believe
the
same
factors
that
counseled
the
court
in
harlow
in
suggesting
that
these
issues
of
immunity
or
freedom
from
suit
should
be
resolved
sconer
rather
than
later
also
apply
in
a
case
against
a
municipality
when
there
is
nothing
more
in
the
complaint
than
a
bare
allegation
that
there
is
a
municipal
policy.
for
example,
a
municipality
is
faced
with
the
same
expenses
of
litigation
as
an
individual
officer
if
it
must
defend
a
case
which
it
should
not
be
defending
because
a
claim
is
not
stated
against
it.
indeed,
in
that
case,
rather
than
being
free
from
suit,
the
municipality
is
going
to
be
required
to
direct
its
resources
to
the
defense
of
the
case
or
to
settlement.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
i
think
it
is
a
protection
from
suit.
i
think
the
court
said--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--yes,
but
the
point
i
think
that
we're
looking
at
is
we
are
going
to
be
in
a
situation
with
municipalities
that
unless
there
is
at
least
some
allegation
to
indicate
the
implication
of
a
municipal
policy,
then
what
we
are
really
doing
are
defending
the
kinds
of
cases
that
whether
it's
because
of
immunity
or
because
congress
never
conferred
the
right
to
sue
for
vicarious
liability
under
1983--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--it
does
happen
all
the
time,
but
not
in
the
circumstances
where
there
is
an
impact,
an
intrusion
on
the
affairs
of
a
municipal
government.
i
think--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--i
think
municipalities,
indeed--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--are
different,
and
i
would
suggest--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--well,
there
have
been--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--there
have
been
a
variety
of
cases,
though,
where
lower
courts,
and
indeed
this
court,
seems
to
have
sanctioned
the
possibility
that
something
more
than
bare
notice
pleading
is
going
to
be
required.
in
the
associated
general
contractors
case
versus
the
plumbers
in
a
footnote
in
that
case,
the
court
indicated
that
in
the
context
of
a
massive
antitrust
suit,
maybe
the
court
needs
to
step
in
early
and
require
something
more
in
the
way
of
factual
allegations
before
the
parties
are
required
to
launch
into
a
case
that's
going
to
involve
massive
expense,
massive
discovery,
and
massive
disruption.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
it's
deficient--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--it's
not
deficient
perhaps
to
state
a
claim.
it's
just
not
deficient
to
state
a
claim
against
the
municipality.
these
two
events--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--well,
i
think
if
that
is
held
to
state
a
constitutional
violation,
perhaps
that
allegation
is
sufficient
to
state
a
claim.
it
simply
isn't
sufficient
to
state
a
claim
against
the
municipality.
it's
sufficient
to
state
perhaps
the
claim
that
congress
granted
to
a
potential
plaintiff,
and
that
is
a
lawsuit
against
the
individual
officer.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
yes.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
yes,
again
without
any
basis
in
fact.
it's
just
the
statement.
that
kind
of
policy--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that's
perhaps
so
as
a
factual
basis,
but
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
when
the
claim
is
asserted
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
it.
the
problem
with
these
kinds
of
cases
is
if
this
pleading
is
held
to
be
appropriate
and
satisfactory
under
rule
12,
every
case
that
involves
the
potential
qualified
immunity
of
an
officer,
every
case
of
allegedly
wrongful
or
unconstitutional
activities
by
a
lower
level
officer
of
a
municipality
will
state
a
claim
under
city
of
harris...
city
of
canton
v.
harris.
and
that
is,
i
would
submit,
an
anomalous
result
that
these
kinds
of
pleadings
could
state
a
cause
of
action
under
city
of
canton
v.
harris
even
though
we
are
counseled
by
that
opinion
that
a
policy
can't
even
be
established
unless
there
can
be
some
demonstration
of
deliberate
indifference.
deliberate
indifference
seems
to
me
to
be
cast
in
the
notion
of
disregard--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
again
without
basis.
everything
that's
alleged
with
respect
to
the
municipal
policy
is
simply
cut
and
pasted
from
this
court's
opinion
in
city
of
canton
v.
harris.
there's
no
basis
for
it.
the
only
allegations
of
conduct...
there
is
nothing
in
the
pleading--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--i
think
the
facts
are
highly
unusual,
but
i
don't
think
the
facts
are
sufficient
to
put
a
policymaker
on
notice
of--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that
is
an
allegation.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
situation
here.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
well,
standing
around
and
doing
the
things
they're
alleged
to
do
may,
indeed,
be
outrageous,
perhaps
even
wrongful
behavior,
but--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that,
indeed,
could
be
something
that
is
assumed.
again,
that
can
be
assumed
from
any
allegation
of
a
wrong
by
an
officer.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
the
fact--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--the
facts
are
bizarre,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
facts
are
egregious,
justice
stevens.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
they
are
not
typical.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
what
we
have
in
one
instance
is
the
shooting
of
dogs.
we
don't
know
what
the
circumstances
are.
the
police
reports,
which
are
attached
to
the
affidavits
that
were
filed
in
the
district
court,
indicate
that
in
both
instances
the
officers
were
attacked
by
the
dogs.
now,
if
that
is
the
fact
and,
indeed,
this
was
a
german
shepherd
dog
and
a
doberman
which
were
unleashed,
uncaged,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
outrageous
conduct.
as
far
as
the
fact
that
the
officers
may
have
been...
let
me
assume
they
were...
standing
around
the
premises
after
the
search,
that
again
may
be
inappropriate
conduct.
whether
it's
illegal
i
question.
whether
it's--
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
--that
is,
indeed,
the
allegation.
and
i
think
that
sometimes
a
conduct,
for
example,
the
shooting
of
a
fleeing
felon,
can
be
so
outrageous,
it's
the
kind
of
outrageous
conduct
that
counsels
there
must
be
a
failure
of
training.
now,
if
we
really
have
a
lot
of
police
officers
sitting
around
in
lawn
chairs
drinking
beer,
i
suggest
that
doesn't
counsel
that...
a
failure
of
training.
i
think
there
the
outrageous
conduct
is
the
outrageous
conduct
of
the
officers.
mr.
brett
a.
ringle
absolutely
not.
if
there
had
been
some
indication
to
let
the
policymaker
know,
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
establishing
the
policy--
