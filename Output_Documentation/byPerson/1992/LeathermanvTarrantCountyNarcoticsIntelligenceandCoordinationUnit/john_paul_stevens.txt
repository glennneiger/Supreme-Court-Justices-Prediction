justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
talking
about
the
municipality
has
immunity
from
suit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
we
don't
have
a
state
here
or
a
territory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
immunity
you're
referring
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
not
suing
on
a
respondeat
superior
theory,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
back
to
whether
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action
now
without
a
heightened
pleading
requirement.
i
thought
we
took
the
case
to
decide
whether
there's
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
when
someone
brings
a
1983
action
alleging
the
municipality
is
liable
for
its
own
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
many
officers
were
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
many
were
sitting
on
the
lawn
afterwards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
weren't
other
officers
present?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
officers
were
present
in
the
two
combined
incidents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
big
is
this
entire
police
force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
we
have
75
percent
of
the
police
force
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
inference
of
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
large
did
you
say
the
police
force
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
big
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
100,000
or
5,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
why
did
you
oppose
discovery?
or
did
you?
i
think
he
said
you
did
oppose
discovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
give
the
names
of
the
officers
and
their
rank
and
all
the
rest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
you
also
agree
these
facts
are
a
little
bit
unusual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
give
rise
to
any
suggestion
that
anybody
might
have
trained
these
officers
a
little
bit
better?
they
argue
it's
so
obvious
that
there
was
a
failure
to
train
that
you
don't
need
anything
more
than
this.
that's
one
of
their
allegations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
fairly
routine
to
go
out
shooting
dogs
and
hanging
around
afterwards
talking
on
the
lawn
and
all
that?
that
does
seem
to
be
a
rather
obvious
lack
of
training
if
your
officers
behave
in
that
manner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
somewhat
indicative
of
not
well
disciplined,
professional
officers.
that's
the
notion
that
i
get
from
the
complaint.
now,
maybe
the
facts
aren't
true,
of
course.
i
can't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
no,
it
couldn't
because
these
are
rather...
these...
you
say
any
allegation,
but
these
are
rather
unusual
facts.
they're
not
a...
this
is
not
a
typical
complaint
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
haven't
seen
one
quite
like
this
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
soon
as
you
say
they're
bizarre,
they're
not
typical.
