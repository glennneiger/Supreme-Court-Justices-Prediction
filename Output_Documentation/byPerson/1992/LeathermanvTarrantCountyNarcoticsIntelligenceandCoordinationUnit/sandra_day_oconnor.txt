justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--counsel,
did
you
allege
in
the
complaint
a
policy
of
the
city
to...
or
the
county
to
always
shoot
dogs,
or
was
the
allegation
really
a
failure
to
train?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
read
it
as
a
failure
to
train
allegation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--not
a
municipal
policy
allegation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
that's
sort
of
a
strange
way
to
plead
a
policy,
but
in
any
event,
i
wanted
to
clarify
what
it
was
you've
alleged.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
read
allegations
of
failure
to
train
and
deliberate
indifference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
below
alternatively
ruled
for
the
defendants
on
a
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
district
court
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
the
collateral
estoppel
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
those
would
be
open
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
this
very
case
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
also
alleged
deliberate
indifference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
amended
complaint
also
alleges
deliberate
indifference.
