justice
byron
r.
white
you
claim
that
something
more
was
necessary
to
state
a
cause
of
action
than
was
stated
in
the
amended
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
amended
complaint
did
not
allege
a
failure
in
training?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's...
as
i
read
it,
it
says
the
defendant
city
of
lake
worth
failed
to
formulate
and
implement
an
adequate
policy
to
train
its
officers
on
the
proper
manner
in
which
to
respond.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
say
that...
why
is
that
inadequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
more
should
it
have
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
that
they
should
have
recounted
in
the
complaint
various
other
acts,
similar
acts--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
that
they
would
have
to
prove
perhaps
at
trial
to
show
that
there
was
a
deliberate
indifference--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
the
training.
but
you
think
you
have
to
state
those
underlying
facts
in
the
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
claim
that
the
complaint
should
have
stated
these
details,
and
i
thought
the
complaint
was
dismissed
based
on
the
fact
that
the
complaint
itself
was
inadequate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the...
what
was
the
affirmance
based
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
that's
the
issue
we
got
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there's
any
other
ground
that
judgment
could
be
affirmed
on,
it's
not
before
us
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
got
to
rule
on
the
12(b)(6)
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
all...
if
they
had
just
said
that,
well,
and
last
week
and
the
week
before
they
did
the
same
thing
or
something
very
similar,
you
wouldn't
be
here
i
suppose.
