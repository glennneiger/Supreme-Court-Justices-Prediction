mr.
goodman,
you
seem
to
be
adopting
the
proposition
that
the
use
of
race
is
perfectly
okay
so
long
as
it
is
benign,
it's
intended
for
a
good
purpose.
i
don't
know
that
that
accords
with
our
law.
we
have
not
allowed,
for
example,
racial
set-asides
in
contracting--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
that
had
a
benign
purpose.
you're
saying
race...
racial
judgments
are
okay
so
long
as
your
intent
is
good.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
think
that
they're
the
wrong
plaintiffs
here.
is
that
the
only
problem?
you
want
this
decided
because
they're
the
wrong
plaintiffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
if,
in
fact,
some
white
democrats
had
brought
the
suit
claiming
that
this
was
diluting
their
votes,
then
the
suit
might
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
violate
the
voting
rights
act.
thereby...
i
had
assumed
the
purpose
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
to
prevent
racial
determinations
in
voting,
that
drawing
up
districts
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
it
has
the
ironic
effect
of
inducing
all
the
states
to
use
race
in
drawing
up
their
districts
lest
they
be
accused
of
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act.
what
an
ironic
consequence.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
hard
to
show.
very
often
it's
the
party
who
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
showing
dilution
or
of
showing
nondilution
who's
going
to
lose.
so,
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
you
have
the
right
intentionally
to
use
race
in
the
drawing
up
of
districts,
and
the
other
side
is
going
to
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
that
intentional
use
of
race
somehow
caused
a
dilution.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
an
extraordinary
principle
for
us
to
adopt
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
administrative
efficiency.
justice
antonin
scalia
administrative
efficiency
demands
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
and
give
it
a
wide
berth.
i
assume
they
should
act
prophylactically
if
there's
even
a
minor
risk,
right,
of
a
gingles
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
isn't
just
gingles
applied
all
the
way.
it's
even
a
minor
risk.
play
it
safe
and
use
racial
districts
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
proper?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying,
mr.
gilliam,
that
it's
perfectly
okay
so
long
as
it
doesn't
dilute?
that's
the
only
claim
you're
making
here,
that
this
is
bad
because
it
dilutes,
and
if
we
find
that
that
is
not
a
valid
reason
to
object,
then
you're
content
to
have
judgment
go
against
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
making
some
other
claim
besides
the
dilution?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gilliam,
in
the
response
that
you
gave
to,
i
guess
it
was,
justice
stevens'
question
where
you...
your
object
is
to
pack
democrats,
but
an
easy
way
to
do
it
is
that
since
you
believe
that
the...
that
blacks
are
largely
voting
democratic,
you've
packed
blacks
as
a
means
of
packing
democrats,
you
said
that
would
be
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
only
be
bad
i
think
you
would
say
if
you
can
establish
block
voting.
even
if
you
couldn't
establish
block
voting,
would
it
be
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
would
it
be
violating...
how
would
there
be
any
dilution?
why
would
section
2
be
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right,
so
long
as
they
don't
vote
as
a
block.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
does
not
produce
any
dilution.
i
mean,
apart
from
the
constitutionality
of
it,
just
whether
it
violates
section
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
still
violates
section
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
dilution
of
what,
mr.
gilliam?
of
the
black
vote
or
of
the
democratic
vote?
i
thought
the
voting
rights
act
was
intended
to
protect
blacks,
not
democrats--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
republicans
for
that
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goodman--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
acknowledge
that
the
reason
race
was
used
in
particular
was
in
order
to
assure
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
