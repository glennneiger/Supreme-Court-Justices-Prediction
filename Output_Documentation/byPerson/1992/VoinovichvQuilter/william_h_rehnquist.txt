chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-1618,
george
voinovich
v.
barney
quilter.
mr.
goodman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
you
may,
mr.
goodman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
gilliam.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
mr.
gilliam,
what
if
the
apportionment
board
had
said
we
want
to
have
a
republican
reapportionment,
and
so
we're
going
to
try
to
cut
down
democratic
voting
strength
wherever
we
can,
consistent
with
the
ohio
constitution,
and
so
forth?
and
they
end
up
creating
an
additional
majority-minority
block
vote,
but
they
treat
white
and
black
democratic
legislators
equally.
they
discriminate
against
them
all.
is
there
anything
constitutionally
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
voting
rights
act
or
under
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
argument
on
the
other
side
here
would
be,
you
know,
this
is
a
disparate
impact
perhaps,
but
it
is
not
done
with
intent
to
discriminate
against
blacks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
do
with
a
case
like
whitcomb
against
chavis
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
well,
supposing
you
have
here
the
intent
is
not
to...
as
i
believe
i
have
put
in
my
question,
the
intent
is
not
to
discriminate
against
blacks,
but
to
diminish
democratic
voting
strength.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
keep
hypothesizing
a
racial
gerrymander,
intimating
that
it
is
with
intent.
but
my
question
is
it
was
not
with
intent
to
discriminate
against
blacks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
not
answering
my
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.--
--was
there
any
finding
in
the
court
below
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
ohio
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
the
same
thing
under
whitcomb
against
chavis,
mr.
gilliam,
if
there
was
no
intent...
if
the
intent
is
only
to
discriminate
against
democrats
so
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
unless
you're
just
talking
about
the
voting
rights
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
just
disparate
treatment
of
democrats
and
republicans,
even
though
it
also
involved
black
democrats,
as
well
as
white
democrats,
would
not
automatically
rule
something
out
under
the
constitution
at
any
rate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gilliam.
mr.
goodman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goodman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1618
voinovich
versus
quilter
would
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
