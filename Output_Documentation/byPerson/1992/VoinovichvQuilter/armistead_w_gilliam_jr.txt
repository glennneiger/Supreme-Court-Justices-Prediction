mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
take
up
a
little
bit
of
the
factual
background
for
the
decision
that
was
made
here
and
then
to
respond,
i
believe,
to
some
of
the
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
the
court's
questions.
the
stage
on
which
this
was
played
out
in
ohio
in
1991
was
that
there
were
11
black
legislators
who
had
been
repeatedly
elected.
they
had
been
repeatedly
elected
with
very
large
majorities.
they
were...
seven
of
them
were
elected
from
districts
where
there
were
less
than
50
percent
black
population.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
racial
block
voting.
the
experts
on
both
sides
agreed
with
that
proposition.
the
experts
for
the
appellants
found
that
in
the
period
1986
to
1990
the
white
crossover
vote
was
in
the
magnitude
of
60
percent
or
greater.
our
expert
found
coalitional
voting
throughout
the
state
of
ohio.
that
finding
was
supported
by
the
fact
that
blacks
had
been
repeatedly
elected
with
35
percent
of
the
population,
and
they
had
done
that
over
a
period
of
20
years.
now,
into
this
particular
breach,
the
appellants
stepped
and
said
we
must
create
as
many
majority-minority
districts
as
we
possibly
can.
there
was
no
investigation
prior
to
that
policy
announcement
of
whether
or
not
there
was
polarized
voting.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
on
those
facts
alone,
no.
the
question
would
be
was
their
act
vote
dilutive.
did
it
have
the
effect
of
diluting
the
votes
of
black
citizens
under
the
voting
rights
act?
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
not
arguing
my
opponent's
case.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
race
is
used,
there
are
circumstances,
for
example,
in
section
5
cases
where
race
is
used
to
correct
a
racial
discrimination,
a
racial
vote
dilution.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
and
that's
the
only
circumstances
under
which
race
can
be
used.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
i
misled
you
then,
sir.
i
intended
to
indicate
that--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--well,
there
had
been
no--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--that's
correct,
exactly.
in
fact,
the
prior
predicate,
racial
discrimination,
wasn't
shown
even
as
a
threshold
matter
in
this
case.
the
two
gingles
factors
which
are
critical,
which
is
the
polarized
voting,
was
totally
shown
not
to
occur...
the
solicitor
general
bases
his
argument
on
that
particular
point.
secondly,
there
was
no
inability
of
black
candidates
to
be
elected.
they
were
repeatedly
elected,
and
they
elected...
black
voters
elected
not
only
black
candidates,
but
white
candidates
of
choice
repeatedly.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
the
way
you've
said
it,
no.
let
me
amplify,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
in
ohio
there's
a
constitution.
there
is
no
conflict
shown
between
the
constitutional
provisions
which
deal
with
reapportionment
and
the
voting
rights
act.
acting
under
the
constitution,
they
are
free
to
engage
in
policy.
if
they
created
a
majority-minority
district
which
had
the
dilutive
effect
on
black
voters
so
that
the
voters
in
that
district
were
packed
and
fragmented
as,
for
example,
happened
in
the
armour
case,
then
they
would
have
to
respond
as
to
why
that
was
done.
if--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--they
would
have
to
respond
under
both
because,
as
the
court
has
observed,
strict
scrutiny
is
required
because
of
racial
classifications.
there's
a
long
line
of
cases.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
the
argument
is
made,
your
honor,
that
there's
no
difference
between
a
partisan
gerrymander
which
has
racial
effects
and
a
racial
gerrymander,
and
i
suggest
they
are
one
and
the
same
because--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--your
honor,
with
respect
to
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
intent
was
not
a
factor
in
that
case.
it
was
conceded
not
to
be
a
factor
in
that
case.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
then
we
look
to
the
effects
under
the
voting
rights
act
and
where
you
have
a
racial
gerrymander,
which
is
statewide,
which
packs
and
fragments
black
voters
with
dilutive
effects.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
it
was
racial
because
it's
admitted
that
it
was
racial.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
absent
race
and
there's
a
political
gerrymander,
my
view
of
that
is
that
whites
and
blacks
may
not
be
treated
alike
because
section
2
forbids
that.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
violation
of
the
fourteenth,
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
the
voting
rights
act
if
dilutive
effects
are
shown.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
i
think
there
has--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--i
think
there
have
to
be
effects
under
both
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
no.
i
think
that
under
your
decisions,
race
is
an
impermissible
use
where
there
are
unequal
and
disparate
results.
here
the...
there
were
unequal,
disparate
results,
and
in
my
view
that
is
sufficient.
i
also
say
that
we
have
here
a
statewide
packing
of
black
citizens,
and
the
theory
is
that
this
is
necessary.
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
your
honor,
it
says
that
you're
not
entitled
to
proportional
representation.
there's
a
disclaimer
in
the
statute.
that's
a
clear
prohibition
upon
creating
a
right
to
majority-minority
districts,
which
is
what
is
proclaimed
here
by
guaranteed
safe
seats,
which
is
their
theory
upon
which
they
are
operating.
now,
unless
they
remove
that
disclaimer,
they
have
nothing
but
a
naked,
freestanding
gerrymander
with
no
justification.
they
say
they
don't
have
to
justify.
there
is
no
burden
of
proof
upon
them
to
justify
this.
they
make
no
excuse
about
how
the
disclaimer
should
be
overcome.
in
fact,
what
they
say
is
we
have
a
rational
state
policy.
we
don't
know
what
that
rational
state
policy
is
because
they're
not
following
the
ohio
constitution.
they
claim
federalism
but
abandon
their
own
constitution
in
the
name
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
what
the
court
below
found
was
that
the
ohio
constitution
was
abandoned
in
that...
in
favor
of
the
voting
rights
act.
so,
there
was
not
a
finding
that
the
ohio
constitution
was
violated
by
the
district
court.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes.
for
this
reason,
they
have
admitted
a
racial
classification.
the
strict
scrutiny
cases
of
this
court
require
that
there
be
a
permissible
inquiry
by
the
court
as
to
why
is
that
so.
you
have
now
made
these
majority-minority
districts.
why
did
you
do
so?
they
have
to
show,
at
a
minimum,
that
there
is
no
vote
dilution.
if
we
look
at
the
issues
of
voting
rights,
we
should
look
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
standards.
there
are
nine
of
them
set
forth
in
the
statute.
they
say
that
we
don't
have
to
even
look
at
these
standards.
we
can
simply
apply
these...
the
voting
rights
without
reference
to
its
own
standards,
without
reference
to
the
history
of
ohio,
which
shows
no
polarized
voting,
a
key
fact,
without
reference
to
the
fact
that
there's
coalitional
voting.
we
just
do
it.
and
that
was
the
excuse
that
was
used
in
gomillion.
the
alabama
legislature
said
we
simply
rely
on
state
power.
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
us
to
gerrymander
blacks
out
of
tuskegee,
and
my
opponents
say
it's
perfectly
all
right
to
gerrymander
blacks
out
of
the
white
suburbs
into
the
inner
cities
simply
because
we
have
the
power
to
do
so.
we
need
not
justify
use
of
race
by
going
through
the
standards
of
the
voting
rights
act.
with
respect
to--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--no.
let
me
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes.
i
think
that
there...
that
the
state
has
to
justify
its
use
of
race
i
think
in
and
of
itself.
we
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
the
declaratory
judgment
request
that
we
made
was
that
the
trial
court
remove
from
the
appellants
the
sword
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
require
them
to
comply
with
the
ohio
constitution.
that
is
the
central
claim
of
our
case:
their
misuse
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
way
they
have
done
it
without
justifying.
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
yes.
that
would
be
sufficient
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
no.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
i
understand
that.
there
is
in
your
hypothetical
no
use
of
race
which
has
a
conceivable
dilutive
effect,
and
you
have
explained
the
justification
for
it
without
any
explanation
which
adds
dilution
to
it.
in
those
circumstances,
i
do
not
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
your
question
suggests
that
in
those
circumstances,
i
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
let
me
answer
the
answer
would
be
yes,
and
let
me
tell
you
why,
if
i
may.
any
apportionment
will
create
a
certain
number
of
majority-minority
districts.
it
is
inevitable
because
of
the
situation
that
we
live
in
in
the
cities
and
countryside.
that
is
not
what
we
complain
about.
we
are
not
complaining
about
an
apportionment
that
creates
majority-minority
districts
that
simply
emerge
from
the
process.
we
are
not
complaining
about
a
situation,
for
example,
where
a
cohesive
minority
group
were
simply
held
together.
we're
not
talking
about
a
situation
where
section
5
applies.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
deliberate
use
of
race
to
gerrymander
statewide
done
because...
not
because
of
state
policy,
but
because
it
is
mandated
by
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
your
honor,
given
the
widespread
implications
of
what
they
did,
it
would
have
been
obvious
what
they
did.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
i
might
have
had
an
easier
job,
yes,
but
the
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--yes,
i
would
in
that...
in
your
example,
yes.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
violate
both.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
the
racially
homogeneous
state
is
a
much
more
difficult
question,
and
i--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--answer...
i
would
probably
answer
it
no.
i'd
probably
answer
your
question
no
because
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
pack
blacks
in
a
racially
homogeneous
state
as
you
have
suggested.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
you
could
pack
democrats.
the
decisions
of
this
court
has
allowed
the
packing
of
democrats
from
time
to
time.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
that
would
violate
section
2.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
on
the
grounds
that
it
diluted
the
black
vote.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
cases,
as
i
have
read
them,
have
required
both...
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
both
intent
and
effect.
the
voting
rights
act
cases
are
effect
cases.
you
can
have
both
in
a
voting
rights
act
case.
i
don't
shrink
from
the
burden
of
showing
effect
in
this
case,
but
that
is
my
reading
of
the
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes,
and
that's
an
effect.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
it
is
different.
it
is
an
effect
also,
however.
where
blacks
are
gerrymandered
or
anybody
is
gerrymandered,
the
entire
purpose
of
the
gerrymander
is
to
move
a
group
out
of
a
district
where
they're
expressing
a
voting
preference,
where
they're
engaged
in
some
sort
of
influence.
if
they
didn't
have
influence,
there
wouldn't
be
a
reason
to
gerrymander
them,
and
that
is
what
occurred
in
this
case.
i
want
to--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
because
a
racial
gerrymander
may
be
a
new
dilution.
section
2
of
the
act
deals
with
vote
dilution
in
general.
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
is
essentially
that
in
the
absence
of
racially
polarized
voting,
there
can't
be
any
vote
dilution.
by
that
theory,
one
could
pack
and
fragment
blacks
to
one's
heart's
content,
create
100
percent
black
districts.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
no,
no.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
voting
as
a
block
is
different
from
polarized
voting.
voting
as
a
block
in
this
case,
may...
if
i
may
address
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
very
clear.
both
sides
concede
that
blacks
voted
cohesively.
it
happened
to
be
85
to
95
percent
democratic.
but
that's
quite
different
from
polarized
voting.
if
polarized
voting
doesn't
exist...
if,
for
example,
the
patient
is
well
and
it
wasn't
ohio,
it
is
the
view
then
of
the
appellants,
we
could
send
the
patient
to
the
hospital,
do
a
racial
gerrymander,
remove
vital
organs,
to
carry
the
metaphor
further,
and
don't
do
this
without
a
diagnosis,
no
medical
checkup.
now,
the
voting
rights
act
prevents
new
discriminations,
as
well
as
old
discriminations.
it
doesn't
say
that
we
only
have
these
factors
to
look
at.
it's
not
a
mechanical
application,
as
the
solicitor
general
would
suggest.
he
also
suggests
that
unless
you
have
50
percent
blacks
in
the
district,
there
is
no
potential
for
dilution
of
their
vote.
if
you
had
a
49
percent
district,
for
example,
which
was
regularly
electing
a
black
candidate,
you
could
split
it
in
half
and
that's
perfectly
okay.
now,
the
voting
rights
act
reaches
that
kind
of
behavior,
and
we
say
that
you
cannot
split
blacks
for
racial
or
partisan
purposes.
you
can't
fragment
them
for
racial
or
partisan
purposes--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--if
it
does
not
produce
dilution--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--then
you've
got...
then
i
have
to
fall
back
on
my
argument
which
i
made
to
you
earlier,
which
is
that
there's
a
misuse
of
the
voting
rights
act.
to
create
this,
you
cannot
use
a
federal
statute
for
this
purpose.
you
must
stick
with
your
state
statute.
if
it
does
not
create
dilution
and
there
is
no
prohibition
in
state
law,
then
i
haven't
proven
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act
unless
i
prove
effect.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
the
forbidden
effect--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--of
a
gerrymander
is
multiple.
first
of
all,
if
blacks
are
packed,
where
it's
very
clear
that
for
years
and
years
and
years
they've
been
electing
a
black
candidate
with
a
very
large
majority...
for
example,
a
majority
here
was
in
the
area
of
75
percent.
because
of
the
packing,
the
results
of
the
last
election
were
that
the
majority
went
up
to
85
percent.
that's
clearly
packing
under
any
definition
in
terms
of
the
results
of
what
occurred.
so,
you've
got
wasted
votes
in
the
packed
districts.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
but
your...
the
answer
would
be
no,
if
i
understand
you
correct...
your
answer
correctly.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
that's
the
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
i
think
packing
is
dilutive.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
it's
evidence
of
dilution,
and
it
is
dilution
under
my
theory,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
in
that
case,
i'm
mistaken.
somehow
or
other
i'm
confused.
let
me
see
if
i
can
straighten
it
out.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
it
is
dilution--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--it's
dilution
of
the
black
vote
that
we
are
talking
about.
black
votes
are
diluted
if
they
are
wasted,
your
honor,
because
they
don't
have
as
much
value
as
the
value
of
white
votes
that
haven't
been
packed.
now,
black
votes
also
when
they're
packed
create,
as
your
honor
has
quite
accurately
pointed
out,
a
side
effect
which
is
the
removal
of
the
blacks
from
the
area
where
they
were
the
problem.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
the
harm
is
felt
throughout
the
state
because
the
number
of
legislators
who
have
to
respond
to
black
interests
is
diluted.
the
ability
of
the
blacks
to
build
the
coalition
that
they
built,
for
example,
in
ohio
is
affected.
their
ability
to
participate
in
the
political
process,
which
is
what
we
have
been
talking
about,
is
affected.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
well,
unless
i
misunderstand
your
question,
gingles
itself
says
in
footnote
11,
page
46,
that
racial
gerrymanders
are
bad.
they
exempt
that
from
the
major
discussion
of
the
case.
they
also
say
they're
not
talking
about
single-member
districts.
they're
talking
about
multi-member
districts
where
blacks
have
submerged.
in
single-member
districts,
blacks
are
fragmented,
fractured,
and
segregated,
moved
out
of
the
suburbs,
as
it
were,
in
this
case
into
the
inner
cities.
gingles...
a
mechanical
application
of
gingles,
as
is
suggested
here,
would
basically
give
a
green
light
to
racial
gerrymandering
of
the
most
extreme
sort
in
a
state
where
there
had
been
no
racial
block
voting,
as
ohio
was.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
all
right,
sir,
yes.
racial,
meaning
that
blacks
were
the
target
of
the
gerrymander.
gerrymander--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--yes,
i
think.
gerrymander
because
they
were
moved
for
partisan
purposes,
and
to
a--
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
--no.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
when
you
use
race
for
partisan
purposes,
you
are
engaging
in
an
invidious
use
of
race
because
a
racial
gerrymander
and
a
partisan
gerrymander
using
race,
as
i
have
said,
is
one
and
the
same
thing.
it's
the
deliberate
use
of
race
to
achieve
an
object.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
i
am
talking
about
the
voting
rights
act,
and
i
am
also
talking
about
the
constitution,
your
honor.
i
understand
the
rule
of
whitcomb
v.
chavis
and
that
we
have
the
burden
of
showing
intent
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armistead
w.
gilliam,
jr.
that
would
be
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
proportional
representation,
i
simply
want
to
address
that
briefly,
if
i
may.
we
have
said
here
that
there
were
guaranteed
safe
seats,
and
this
was
the
remedy
that
was
being
applied.
they
have
said,
well,
they
were
doing
this
for
benevolent
purposes
for
a
rational
state
purpose.
if
we
look
at
the
actual
districts
that
were
involved,
for
example,
mr.
mallory
who
is
here
in
the
audience.
mr.
mallory
is
60
years
old.
we're
going
to
increase
his
district
because
he
may
not
make
it
into
the
next
10
years.
we
look
at
a
couple
of
others,
mr.
beatty,
mr.
miller.
they
may
run
for
other
offices.
if
we
look
at
mr.
jones,
mr.
sykes,
they're
living
in
toledo
and
they're
living
in
akron.
we're
going
to
increase
theirs
because
there
may
be
some
racial
migration.
blacks
may
actually
move
to
the
suburbs,
and
we've
got
to
protect
that
seat.
and
these
are
the
explanations
i've
set
forth
on
pages
10
and
11
in
my
brief,
and
i
submit
that
that's
not
rational.
that's
not
a
state
policy.
that's
not
correction
of
prior
dilution
or
vote
discrimination
or
curing
anything
that
happened
under
the
voting
rights.
and
those
are
the
purposes
they
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
case
to
this
trial
court
that
they
were
pursuing.
they
were
eliminating
discrimination.
they
say
that
in
their
answer.
they
argue
that
in
the
trial
courts...
to
the
trial
court
which
resulted
in
the
trial
court
saying
show
us.
tell
us
how
you're
doing
that.
thank
you.
