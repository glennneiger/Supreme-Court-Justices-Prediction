justice

r.
white
plan...
you
intentionally
used
race.
you
intentionally
used
race
to
favor
the
black...
for
the
minority
community
to
give
them
a
majority...
insure
them
control
of
these
districts.
isn't
that
so
far
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
so
far
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
a
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
say
that
any
time
the
black
community
agrees
with
you
in
creating
a
minority-majority
district,
that
that's
all
you
need
for
this
purposeful
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
the
commission
should
be
able
to
use
just
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
instead
of
the
gingles
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
racial
block
voting.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
don't,
but...
because
you
don't
want
to
apply
the
gingles
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
don't
want...
you
want
to
reverse
the
district
court
on
another
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
want
to...
i
mean,
the
argument
you've
been
making
would
reverse
the
district
court
not
on
the
mistake
on
the...
in
applying
the
gingles
test--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
just
on
this
more
general
view--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
you
can
discriminate
as
long
as
you
think
you're
doing
it
for
a
good
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
about
the
district
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
racial
block
voting
in
ohio?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we...
to
find
for
you,
do
we
have
to
find
that
that
was
plain
error
or
was
what?
what
do
we
have
to
do--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
justification
for
a
state
in
reapportioning
ever
deliberately
taking
race
into
account
in
order
to
create
a...
intentionally
to
create
a
single-member
district
that
will
be
controlled
by
a
minority?
does
there
have
to
be
any
precondition
met?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
what's
your
answer?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
it
raise
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
there
has
been
a
challenge
to
creation
of
any
minority
controlled
districts
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
your
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short,
if
the
gingles...
if
the
state
can
satisfy
the
gingles
factors,
they
may
create
these
districts.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
constitutionally
i
would
like
to
know
what
a
state
has
to
show
ever
to
create
a...
intentionally
a
minority
controlled
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
involves
applying
the
gingles
factors?
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
does
the
government
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it
violate
the
constitution
to
deliberately
use
race
in
this
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
exactly.
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
way
you
describe
it,
there
would
be
no
reason
in
ohio
to
discriminate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
that
there
had
been
no
discrimination
against
blacks
in
all...
anywhere
in
ohio.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
prior
discrimination
is
a
predicate
to
satisfying
the
constitution,
it
wasn't
present
in
ohio.
