well,
mr.--
--that
may...
excuse
me.
mr.
hungar,
would
you
mind
addressing
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
heretofore
with
mr.
goodman
about
whether
it
is
possible
to
take
race
into
account
in
drawing
these
lines
without
invoking
the
strict
scrutiny
of
cases
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
when
you
use
race
as
the
basis
for
doing
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
who
has
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gilliam,
why
do
the
appellants
have
to
prove
that
the
voting
rights
act
required
their
plan?
why
isn't
the
question
whether
the
plan
violates
the
voting
rights
act?
i
mean,
could
you
explain
that
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
in
1991,
the
ohio
state
apportionment
board
reapportioned
the
electoral
districts
for
the
state
legislature
there
in
accordance
with
ohio
state
constitution's
requirement
that
reapportion
be
conducted
every
10
years.
the
reapportionment
plan
created
several
districts
in
which
a
majority
of
the
population
is
a
member
of
a
specific
minority
group,
and
these
districts
are
known
there
as
majority-minority
districts.
the
appellees,
who
were
democratic
members
of
the
board
of
apportionment
and
others
who
oppose
the
plan,
challenged
it
in
court,
arguing
that
it
violated
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
as
well
as
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
appellees.
it
held
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
prohibits
the
state
from
intentionally
creating
majority-minority
districts
unless
they
are
necessary
to
remedy
a
section
2
violation.
in
this
case
i
concluded
the
appellants
have
not
shown
a
section
2
violation
and
were
therefore
barred
from
creating
the
majority-minority
districts.
in
addition,
the
court
held
that
the
board
had
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
it
intentionally
diluted
minority
voting
strengths
for
reasons
of
political
advantage,
and
that
the
plan
was
inconsistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
permitted
too
great
a
variance
between
the
size
of
the
largest
and
the
smallest
electoral
districts.
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
prohibit
the
creation
of
majority-minority
districts
or
any
other
particular
type
of
district,
instead
it
focuses
on
the
effective
redistricting,
and
whether
it
results
in
the
delusion
of
the
voting
strength
of
a
protected
class.
in
this
case,
appellees
did
not
show
that
the
plan
diluted
the
strength
of
black
voters
because
they
failed
to
demonstrate
white-black
voting
sufficient
to
frustrate
the
election
of
the
black
voter's
candidates
of
choice.
and
under
our
very
recent
decision
in
growe
versus
emison,
the
appellees
cannot
prevail
here
without
such
of
showing.
and
for
the
additional
reasons
also,
given
in
the
opinion,
we
reverse
the
district
court's
holdings
regarding
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
claims
as
well.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
