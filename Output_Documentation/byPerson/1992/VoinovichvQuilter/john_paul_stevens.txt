justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
are
you
arguing
that
the
proponent
of
the
plan
had
the
burden
of
showing
there
was
no
section
2
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
performing
their
duty
to
prepare
a
proper
plan,
you
say
have
a
duty
to
avoid
a
section
2
violation,
that
would
seem
to
me,
if
you're
saying
that,
that
they
have
a
duty
to
decide
for
themselves
that
this
particular
plan
is
necessary
and,
therefore,
assume
the
burden.
maybe
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this.
supposing
there
were
two
alternate
plans,
one
with
four
majority-minority
districts
and
one
with
five
majority-minority...
however
you
phrase
that,
and
they
thought
both
of
them
would
comply
with
the
law,
could
they
select
a
plan
with
the
five
districts
on
the
ground
they
thought
that
would
be
good
public
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
to
my
question
is
you
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
at
that
point,
mr.
gilliam?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
instead
of
saying
they
think
we
must
do
it
to
comply
with
the
statute,
they
had
said
we
think
it
would
be
good
policy
to
create
as
many
as
we
could.
would
that
be
illegal
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
what
if
their
purpose
was
overtly
to
pack
democrats
into
districts,
and
as
a
byproduct
of
that,
they
packed
certain
racial
groups
in
the
districts?
would
that
violate
either
the
statute
or
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
violate
if
you
had
a
racially
homogeneous
state
and
you're
deliberately
packing
districts
for
the
purpose
of
getting
as
many
majority
republican
districts
as
you
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
certainly
wouldn't...
it
couldn't
violate
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
could
pack
democrats.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
you
would
say
it's
the
same
violation...
maybe
i'm
asking
the
same
question
the
chief
justice
did.
if
their
intent
was
to
pack
democrats
and
incidentally,
in
order
to
do
that,
they
inevitably
had
to
pack
some
blacks--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
would
violate
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that's
your
answer,
then
really
you
should
focus
on
the
other
districts
to
see
if
they're
diluted--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
the
packing
itself
is
not
enough,
as
i
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
evidence
of
dilution
in
other
districts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
seem
to
be
giving
a
different
answer
than
you
gave
to
justice
souter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the
only
harm
because
if
you
go
from
85
to
95
in
district
1,
and
you
go
from
15
to
10
in
district
2,
and
15
to
10
in
district
3,
your
harm
is
strictly
in
districts
2
and
3,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there's
40
percent
democrats
instead
of
30...
40
white
democrats
instead
of
35
percent.
well,
if
all
of
those
concerns
are
valid,
if
those
are
valid
concerns,
of
the
voting
rights
act,
then
our
gingles
test
must
be
wrong
because
all
of
the
evils
that
you
describe
do
not
flow
from
block
voting,
and
we
shouldn't
have
all
those
block
voting
criteria
in
gingles
if,
indeed,
these
evils
are
direct...
are,
you
know...
are
the
object
the
object
of
the
voting
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
the
term
racial
gerrymander?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
what
you
mean
by
gerrymander.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
every
redistricting
that's
motivated
in
part
by
partisan
purposes
a
partisan
gerrymander?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
when
is
it
and
when
it
is
not?
