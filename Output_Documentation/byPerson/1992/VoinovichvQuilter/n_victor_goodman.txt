mr.
n.
victor
goodman
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
state
redistricting
bodies
are
best
situated
to
identify
and
then
reconcile
traditional
state
policies
with
federal
constitutional
and
statutory
requirements.
this
court
has
long
held
that
redistricting
and
reapportioning
legislative
bodies
is
a
legislative
task
which
the
federal
courts
should
make
every
effort
not
to
preempt.
the
district
court
in
this
case
made
every
effort
to
preempt
the
legislative
reapportionment
adopted
by
the
ohio
apportionment
board
on
february
18
of
this
year,
which
we
have
referred
to
in
these
proceedings
as
amendment
d.
during
the
course
of
my
argument
this
morning,
i
plan
to
discuss
each
of
the
district
court's
intrusions
upon
ohio's
apportionment
process.
first,
the
lower
court
preempted
ohio's
redistricting
efforts
by
improperly
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
apportioning
persons
to
justify
their
apportionment
plan
under
the
voting
rights
act.
second,
the
district
court
found,
in
the
face
of
unprecedented
cooperation
and
consultation
with
the
african
american
community
in
our
state,
that
the
apportionment
board
intentionally
discriminated
against
minorities
in
violations
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
third,
and
only
as
an
afterthought
in
the
course
of
their
march
19
opinion
where
the
district
court
denied
our
application
for
a
stay
pending
appeal
to
this
court,
the
district
court
found
that
the
appellants
had
violated
the
one
person-one
vote
rule
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
adhering
to
a
provision
of
the
ohio
constitution
which
permitted
deviations
from
ideal
population
of
plus
or
minus
10
percent
in
the
pursuit
of
our
ohio
constitution's
policy
of
respecting
county
boundaries.
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
complete
and
clear
and
that
none
of
the
findings
of
violations
made
by
the
district
court
are
supported
in
the
record.
accordingly,
we
would
respectfully
request
this
court
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
enter
judgment
in
favor
of
the
appellants.
with
respect
to
the
voting
rights
act,
we
believe
that
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
district
court
are
both
legally
and
factually
incorrect.
the
district
court
held
that
the
apportioning
persons
in
our
state
were
automatically
forbidden
to
create
majority-minority
districts
in
the
absence
of
what
would
amount
to
be
a
judicial
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
district
court
held
that
the
apportioning
board
could
not
implement
the
state's
policy
of
attempting
to
avoid
the
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
in
their
redistricting
plan
without
first
proving
that
the
1981
plan
of
apportionment
violated
the
voting
rights
act
or
that
the
plan
which
they
adopted
on
february
18
did
not
violate
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
your
honor,
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
no,
because
the
district
court
in
passing
seemed
to
say
that
because
there
was
some
political
gerrymandering,
which
they
felt
was
racially
based,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
yes,
your
honor,
it
was,
but
not
for
an
invidious
purpose,
and
we
believe
this
court's
opinion
in
carey
would
support
the
use
of
race,
which
the
apportioning
persons
did
in
this
case.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
it
was
not
for
an
invidious
purpose.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
the
use
of
race
was
not
invidious
and
was,
first
of
all,
necessary
because
of
the
housing
patterns
of
the
african
american
community
in
our
state.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
argument
we
make
between
the
placing
of
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
voting
rights
act,
which
was
shifted
to
the
appellants,
and
the
burden
which
we
believe
we
met
with
respect
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
would
be
correct,
that
we
do
have
an
obligation
to
show...
and
we
believe
the
record
clearly
does
show...
that
the
use
of
race
was
not
for
an
invidious
purpose.
we
believe,
first
of
all,
as
this
court
said
in
mobile,
that
the
plan
was
not
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
against
the
african
american
community.
in
fact,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
ohio
chapter
of
the
naacp
branches
supported
the
plan
before
this
court
as
it
affects
the
minority
community
in
its
entirety.
and
with
respect
to
the
four
districts
of
five...
and
there
were
only
five
minority...
majority-minority
districts
created,
one
more
than
there
was
in
the
1981
plan...
all
the
black
community
supported
the
creation
of
the
four
districts
in
cleveland,
ohio,
or
cuyahoga
county,
and
the
ohio
conference
of
branches
of
the
naacp
supported
our
plan
throughout
the
state
as
it
affected
the
minority
community.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
well,
your
honor,
it
would
depend
again
if
it
were
such
as
this
court's
decision
in
gomillion
where
we
fenced
out
or
minimized
the
political
effectiveness
of
the
black
community,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
but
in
this
case,
all
the
parties--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--i
believe
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
must
be
a
discriminatory
intent
and
an
injury,
and
unless
there
is
shown
to
be
by
the
plaintiffs,
or
the
appellees
in
this
case,
a
showing
that
the
apportioning
persons
used
race
for
an
invidious
purpose
and
that
there
was
an
injury,
then
these
appellees
could
not
approve
and
support
their
case,
and--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
croson
type
case.
this
is
not
a
case
brought
on
behalf
of
whites
urging
that
there
is
reverse
discrimination.
this
is
a
case
that
while
it
seems
to
me
is
for
the
benefit
of
white
democrats...
and
that
was
the
class
sought
to
be
served...
it
is
not
a
case
of
reverse
discrimination,
and
i
believe
that
a
plurality
in
the
carey
case--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--no.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
like
the
carey
case,
although
carey
i
recognize
is
a
section
5
case.
members
of
the
court
in
the
plurality
in
that
case
said
that
the
purposeful
use
of
race
was
not
per
se
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment.
and
i
am
saying
that
this
is
not
a
croson
type
case
of
reverse
discrimination.
i'm
saying
that
all
the
parties
in
this
case
used
race.
the
apportioning
persons
used
it
for
the
purposes
of
making
sure
that
in
the
plan
that
they
drafted,
there
was
no
dilution--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
my
response
would
be
that
since
thornburg
and
the
section
2
amendments
focus
on
the
results
of
a
plan,
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
apportioning
persons
in
this
case
could
have
drafted
a
plan
with
the
housing
and
the
location
of
the
minority
community
in
our
states
without
taking
cognizance
of
race.
and
as...
i
would
submit
that
the
use
for
which
race
is
taken
is
the
issue.
and
unless
there
can
be
shown...
unless
there
can
be
shown...
that
there
was
an
invidious
use
of
it,
that
the
plan
was
conceived
or
operated
for
the
purpose
of
discrimination,
and
unless
there
can
be
demonstrated
an
injury
that
the
use
in
this
case
was,
in
fact,
benign
and
to
carry
out
the
federal
mandate,
i
believe
after
all...
and
i
think
the--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--yes.
well,
we--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
yes,
it
is
a
discrimination,
your
honor,
but
not
for
an
invidious
purpose.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
is
clearly
a
part
of
what
we
are
arguing,
that
there
could
be
no
injury
for
the
protected
class.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
by
the
gingles
test,
you
mean,
your
honor,
the
finding
of
a
majority
of
the
political
cohesiveness--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
and
have
agreed
with
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
that
the
gingles
preconditions
do
apply,
but
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
we
don't
believe
this
court
needs
to
necessarily
adopt
that
position
in
order
to
be
able
to
reverse
the
district
court.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
no.
your
honor,
we
would
have...
we
believe
that
if
this
court
applied
the
gingles
test,
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
finding
a
violation
because,
after
all,
the
district
court
found--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--that
there
was
no--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--well--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--we--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--well,
justice
white--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
on
the
voting
rights
issue,
the
district
court
shifted
the
burden
to
the
apportioning
persons
to
prove
that
their
plan
did
not
violate,
but
we
argue
that
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
the
plan
which
we
had
adopted
did,
in
fact,
cause
the
minority
voting
strength
to
be
diluted.
and
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
attempting
to
comply
with
the
federal
mandate
not
to
adopt
the
plan,
which
does,
in
fact,
cause
vote
dilution,
that
we
had
to
take
race
into
account.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
burden
was
on
these
plaintiffs
to
show
that
the
plan,
which
we
adopted,
the
apportioning
persons
adopted,
did
cause
the
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength,
a
burden
which
they
did
not
bear
nor
does
the
facts...
do
the
facts
of
this
case
warrant
such
a
conclusion
by
the
district
court.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--well,
i
would
think
it
would
not
be
extraordinary
based
upon
how
these
apportionment
plans
are
drafted.
we
have
a
set
of
apportionment
persons
who
say
that
if
we
draft
a
plan
that
does
dilute
minority
voting
strength,
or
arguably
does,
we're
going
to
be
in
court.
and
we
believe
that
you
can't
draft
a
plan
to
comply
with
the
federal
mandate
of
section
2,
which
is
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
to
make
sure
that
you
are
not
engaging
in
some
invidious
discrimination
without
taking
race
into
account.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
we
tried
to
follow
this
court's
gingles
opinion,
and
we
tried
to
follow
the
carey
case
which
did,
again
as
i
say,
note
the
fact
that
purposeful
noting
of
race
was
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
chief--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--your
honor--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that,
as
the
solicitor
would
argue,
that
finding
by
the
district
court
means
that
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
third
gingles
precondition,
and
that
alone...
that
alone...
should
cause
the
district
court's
opinion
to
be
reversed
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
what
the
district
court
would
have
us
do
is
to
look
to
each
and
every
district,
figure
out
how
many
minority
voters
it
takes
to
elect
an
incumbent,
that
would
be
the
amount.
and
if
we
put
any
more
black
population
into
that
county,
we
would
violate
the
act.
this
again
runs
in
the
face
of
the
first
gingles
preconditions.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
thank
you.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
the
record
because,
as
i
listened
to
mr.
gilliam,
i
wasn't
sure
i
was
hearing
the
same
case
that
we're
before
this
court
on.
in
the
first
place,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
district
court
abstained.
the
ohio
supreme
court
found
that
the
plan
did
comport
with
the
ohio
constitution,
and
there
is
no
other
decision
of
any
court
to
conflict
with
that.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
political
gerrymandering,
the
district
court
did
not
find,
even
though
it
was
raised
in
the
course
of
their
amended
complaint,
that
there
was
a
political
gerrymandering.
and
i
believe
yesterday
this
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
wepron.
and
i
believe
that
the
reason
that
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
political
gerrymandering
finding
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
because
after
the
election,
november
the
3rd,
the
democrats
maintained
control
of
the
house
of
representatives,
they
picked
up
one
additional
african
american
seat,
and
the
republicans
lost
the
seat
in
the
senate.
and
therefore,
there
is
no
degradation
of
anyone's
political
influence
on
the
process
as
a
whole.
and
when
the
court
has,
as
i'm
sure
it
has
already,
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
charts,
which
appear
on
pages
177
and
260
of
the
appendix,
the
court
will
find
that
the
democrat
plan
that
was
submitted
contained
six
majority-minority
districts.
the
plan
that
is
before
this
court
has
five
majority-minority
districts.
and
the
chart
that
we
appended
to
our
reply
brief,
chart
la,
will
show
that
the
complaint
that
was
made
that
we
decrease
the
number
of
10
percent
districts...
in
fact,
the
apportioning
persons
created
21
districts
of
10
percent
or
more;
the
democrat
plan,
only
20.
so,
i
think
when
the
court
reviews
the
facts
of
this
case...
and
it
is
not,
by
the
way,
a
strict
scrutiny
case.
there's
not
even
a
citation
of
croson.
but
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
they
did
not
meet
the
burden
of
proof.
they
did
not
show
that
the
plan
which
was
adopted
and
before
this
court,
known
as
amendment
d,
in
any
way
diluted
the
voting
strength
of
the
black
community
in
our
state.
they
did
not
show
that
there
was
any
invidious
discrimination
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
this
court's
opinion,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
carey
supports
us
in
that.
yes,
we
did
use
race,
but
we
had
to
because
of
the
residence
of
a
black
community
in
the
urban
areas.
there
was
no
way
that
we
could
not
have
taken
race
into
account.
and
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
your
honor,
it
is
clearly
and
simply
a
one
person-one
vote
claim.
it
was
made
in
passing
in
their
march
19
opinion.
it
was
sort
of
like
pin
the
tail
on
the
donkey,
or
it
may
have
been
pin
the
tail
on
the
republicans.
but
we
have
shown
that
there
was
a
rational
state
basis,
namely,
our
constitution.
there
is
no
other
plan
that
was
available
that
could
have
met
the
one
man-one
vote
requirements
of
our
constitution,
and
there
was
no
builtin
bias
because
we
created--
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
yes.
mr.
n.
victor
goodman
that
is
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
