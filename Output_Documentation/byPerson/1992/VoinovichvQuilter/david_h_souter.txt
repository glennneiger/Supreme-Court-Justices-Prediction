do
you
accept
the
proposition
that
you
have
the
burden
to
prove
that
your
object
was
to
comply
with
the
federal
law?
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
and
then
you
draw
the
line
and
you
say
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that
you
had
a
very
different
political
complexion
in
ohio
and
the...
at
the
time
it
was
clear
that
they
had
to
reapportion.
the
board
unanimously
agreed
that
everything
basically
seemed
to
be
going
fine.
the
only
thing
they
had
to
worry
about
was
one
person-one
vote
so
that
they
said
we
will
redraw
the
districts
in
a
way
that
will
preserve
the
same
racial
mix
that
we
have
now,
since
it
seems
to
work
to
everybody's
satisfaction.
would
that
be
a
use
of
race
which
would
place
a
burden
upon
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
that's
using
race
and
it's
consciously
using
race.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
your
answer
to
me
also
imply
that
you
have
got
to...
that
you
would
have
the
burden
to
prove
in
the
first
instance
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
dilutive
effect?
and
isn't
that
what
they
are
claiming
you
should
do
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
the
facts
in
this
case
be
different
if
your
opponents
had
not
taken
the
position
that
they
had
drawn
the
lines,
as
they
did,
for
purposes
of
avoiding
a
section
2
violation?
if
they
had
just
kept
mum,
would
you
then
have
had
on
your
own
theory
the
entire
burden
of
proof
to
prove
that
this
was
a
section
2
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
is
simply
to
say
that
you
might
have
had
an
easy
job
under
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
would
you
still
have
had
the
burden
in
the
first
instance?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
would
that
be
true
if
there...
if
the
percentages
in
the
other
districts
were
so
high
that
there
was
no
significant
dilution
in
the
other
districts
by
virtue
of
packing
in
the
one?
