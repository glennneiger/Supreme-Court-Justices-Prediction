mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
section
2.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
this.
the
district
court's
finding
of
a
section
2
vote
dilution
violation
should
be
reversed
because
the
language
and
purpose
of
section
2,
as
amended
in
1982,
and
the
underlying
logic
of
vote
dilution
claims
call
for
a
threshold
focus
on
the
three
preconditions
set
forth
by
this
court
in
gingles.
those
preconditions
are
at
least
as
applicable
in
the
context
of
challenges
to
single-member
districts
as
they
are
in
cases
challenging
the
inherently
dilutive
practice
of
multi-member
districting.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
o'connor,
in
our
view--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
our
view,
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
it
is
always
troubling
when
states
or
government
takes
race
into
account
in
making
decisions.
the
court
yesterday
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
a
case
that
squarely
presents
that
question,
shaw
against
barr,
under
the
voting
rights
act
in
a
closely
related
context.
we
have
not
addressed
that
question
in
this
case,
nor
have
the
parties
in
their
briefs
because
it's
not
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
white
voters
or
any...
members
of
any
other
race,
other
than
blacks,
were
discriminated
against
by
virtue
of
the
state's
decision
to
take
race
into
account.
the
only
claim
in
this
case
is
that
blacks
suffered
intentional
dilution
of
their
voting
power
by
virtue
of
the
state's
decision
to
take
race
into
account.
in
fact,
all
parties
before
the
court
concede
that
it
is
appropriate
to
take
race
into
account.
they
just
differ
over
the
type...
the
manner
in
which
race
is
to
be
taken
into
account.
at
page
37
of
their
brief,
for
example,
the
appellees
take
the
position
that
because
there
is
substantial
white
crossover
voting,
the
state
was
required
to
be
very
careful
in
order
to
avoid
diluting
black
voting
power.
obviously,
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
take
race
into
account.
so,
this
isn't
a
croson
type
case.
this
case
does
not
present
the
issue
presented
in
shaw
against
barr.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
justice
kennedy,
with
respect
i
believe...
we
interpret
the
complaint
to
raise
a
dilution
claim,
that
is,
a
claim
that
black
voters
were
intentionally
discriminated
against.
whether...
the
claim
certainly
is
that
black
voters
were
intentionally
discriminated
against
and
that
the
state
attempted
to,
in
some
sense,
minimize
or
reduce
their
voting
power.
whether
that
is
referred
to
as
an
influence
claim
or
a
dilution
claim,
that
is
the
nature
of
the
claim.
and
in
our
view,
that
is
the
only
claim
before
the
court
and
the
proper
resolution
of
that
claim
is
that
it
should
be
rejected
because
the
district
court
essentially
committed
two
errors
of
law
in
accepting
that
claim.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
don't
believe
so.
for
the...
if
we're
talking
about
intentional
discrimination
under
the
constitution,
we
don't
believe
the
gingles
factors
are
necessarily
applicable
because
the
functions
served
by
the
constitutional
ban
against
intentional
discrimination
is
different
than
the
functions
served
by
section
2.
section
2
focuses
on
equal
access
to
the
process.
the
prohibition
against
intentional
discrimination
focuses
on
exactly
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
we
believe
the
gingles
factors
are
applicable
to
so-called
influence
claims.
if
those
are
a
subset
of
dilution
claims
or
not,
we
believe
that
the
three
gingles
factors
are
fully
applicable
to
all
challenges,
to
vote
dilution
challenges
or
influence
challenges,
to
redistricting
decisions.
and
the
reason
for
that
comes
directly
from
the
language
of
section
2.
section
2
requires
that
racial
polarization,
both
minority
cohesiveness
and
white
block
voting,
be
shown
in
vote
dilution
challenges.
section
2
guarantees
racial
groups
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
political
process
and
elect
representatives
of
their
choice.
there's
no
minority
cohesiveness.
by
definition,
the
minority
group
has
no
representatives
of
its
choice.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
white,
again
that's
a
very
difficult
question
that
raises
sensitive
constitutional
issues
in--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
united
jewish
organizations
against
carey,
a
plurality
of
the
court
suggested
that
that
would
be
appropriate
certainly
in
section
5
cases
where
the
department
of
justice
has
objected.
we
think
more
generally
that
while
this
case
doesn't
raise
the
question,
it
is
appropriate--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
there's
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
state's
failure
to
take
race
into...
or
decision
to
take
race
into
account
in
itself
violated
the
constitution.
appellees
take
the
position
that
the
state
had
to
take
race
into
account
in
order
to
maximize
black
voting
power.
we
don't
agree
that
that's
a
proper
interpretation--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
united
states--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
it
is
appropriate
for
states
to
take
race
into
account
in
certain
circumstances
in
order
to
avoid
a
violation
of
section
2.
in
enacting
amended
section
2
in
1982,
congress
commanded
the
states
not
merely
to
avoid
intentionally
discriminating
against
racial
groups,
but
also
to
avoid
practices--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if...
we
don't
believe
that
the
gingles
factors
alone,
your
honor,
are
enough
to
establish
a
section
2
violation,
but
if
the
state
has
a--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
a
state...
if
the
state
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
it
is
necessary
to
create
majority
and
minority
districts
in
order
to
avoid
a
violation
of
section
2,
it
is
permitted
to
do
so.
that
is
the
necessary
implication
of
what
congress
said
in
enacting
amended
section
2
in
1982.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
that's
part
of
the
analysis
in
our
view.
now,
the...
now,
it's
not
necessarily...
certainly
up
until
this
point,
it
has
not
been
clear
whether
the
gingles
factors
even
apply
in
this
context.
we
believe
they
do.
the
lower
courts
have
taken
different
positions
on
that
question,
and
we
are
asking
the
court
to
hold
against--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor,
because
again
there
is
no...
this
case
does
not
involve
the
type
of
claim
that
we've
just
been
discussing.
there's
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
state
violated
the
constitution
merely
by
taking
race
into
account.
the
appellees
contend
that
the
state
had
to
take
race
into
account.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
certainly
if
a
state
chooses...
congress,
in
enacting
section
2,
commanded
the
states
to
avoid
violating
section
2.
if
a
state
wants
to
be
sure
it's
avoiding...
violating
section
2,
it
makes
sense.
depending
on
the
circumstances
in
the
particular
state,
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
state
to
look
at
racial
considerations
and
make
sure
it's
not
violating
section
2.
it
depends--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
again,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
you
know--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
have
not
addressed
the
precise
nature
of
this
type
of
claim
in
our
brief
and
have
not
taken
a
formal
position
on
that
question
because
in
our
view
it's
not
presented
in
this
case.
it
is
presented
in
shaw
against
barr.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
it
depends...
it's
unlikely.
the
reality
of
redistricting
is
that
there
are
many
factors
and
many
considerations
that
go
into
the
choice
of
a
particular
plan
over
a
particular--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
we
believe
the
first
gingles
precondition--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
