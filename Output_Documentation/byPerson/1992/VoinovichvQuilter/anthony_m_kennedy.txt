is
dilution
the
only
issue
in
the
case
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
as
you
see
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
you
concede
that
race
was
an
explicit
factor
in
the
redistricting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
usual
rule
is
that
disparate
treatment
requires
the
state
in
this
case
or
the
apportioning
authorities
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
there
was
a
compelling
interest,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
first,
let's
just
first
of
all
talk
about
the
burden
of
proof.
if
race
is
the
explicit
category
that's
being
used,
is
it
not
the
usual
rule
in
other
contexts
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
upon
the
entity
using
race
to
come
forward
and
to
show
that
it
was
lawful,
legitimate,
for
necessary
compelling
state
interests,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
agree
that
the
burden
should
be
placed
on
you
in
this
respect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
a
state
decided
that
it
wanted
better
urban-rural
balance,
and
it
said
we
need
to
put
some
rural
voters
into
the...
some
urban
voters
into
the
rural
districts.
could
it
say,
you
know,
most
black
people
are
members
of
urban
communities,
so
we'll
just
move
black
voters
in?
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
would
there
be
a
violation
for
using
this
kind
of
stereotype,
this
kind
of
shorthand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
this
case
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
influence
of
black
voters
was
derogated.
so,
it's
not
just
a
dilution
case,
is
it?
the
complaint
certainly
can't
be
read
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
there's
an
influence
claim,
are
we
remitted
to
the
gingles
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
there's
just
a
section
2
claim
that
they...
which
is
an
influence
claim,
rather
than
a
dilution
claim.
you
still
don't
need
the
gingles
factors,
and
the
burden
of
proof
certainly
then
should
shift
to
the
apportioning
authorities,
shouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
an
important
question.
and
race
isn't
absent
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
because
race
is
the
basis
for
reassigning
the
voters.
so,
don't
say
race
is
not
applicable.
race
is
the
surrogate
used
in
order
to
accomplish
a
political
gerrymander.
in
that
case,
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
if
dilutive
effects
are
not
shown?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
it's
just
a
gingles...
so,
it's
a
gingles
case
no
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
grounds
that
it
diluted
the
black
vote?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
you
have
to
say
dilution?
can't
you
just
say
that
it's
a
degradation
to
the
black
race
to
use
them
in
this
manner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
do
you
have
to
talk
about
vote
dilution
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
can
your
complaint
be
construed...
did
you
allege,
as
one
of
the
theories
of
your
complaint,
that
influence
of
blacks
was
diminished
in
some
districts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
would
be
different
than
dilution,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
forbidden
effect
that
you're
trying
to
prove...
that
you
have
to
prove?
can
you
give
us
the
standard--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
tell
us
when
there's
a
section
2
voting
rights--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--violation?
