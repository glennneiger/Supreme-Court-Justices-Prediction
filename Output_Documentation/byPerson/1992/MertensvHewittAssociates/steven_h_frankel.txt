mr.
steven
h.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
you
now
have
heard,
the
petitioners'
and
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
based
on
two
fundamental
premises.
first,
that
equitable
relief
includes
money
damages.
and
second,
unless
the
1989
amendment
to
the
statute
is
read
to
provide
that
equitable
relief
includes
money
damages,
it
will
be
rendered,
in
essence,
a
nullity.
i
will
demonstrate
why
neither
of
those
premises
can
be
sustained,
since
they
violate
erisa's
language
and
are
inconsistent
with
its
structure.
one
of
the
first
things
each
of
us
learned
as
law
students
is
that
equitable
relief
does
not
include
money
damages.
yet
petitioners'
and
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation
turns
to
the--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--no,
i
do
not
say
that,
justice
white.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
money
damages.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
and--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--you
can
get
a
money
judgment
in
equity,
justice
white.
but
erisa
did
not
adopt
lock,
stock,
and
barrel,
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
common
law
equity
courts.
at
common
law,
equity
courts
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
trust
cases,
and
they
were
able
to
award
both
legal
and
equitable
remedies
because
they
had
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
those
cases.
erisa,
while
influenced
by
the
common
law
of
trusts,
only
selectively
incorporated
certain
of
those
principles.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
yes.
yes,
i
can,
justice
white.
and
let
me
try
to
show
that
to
you
by
contrasting
what
congress
provided
for
in
assessing
the
liabilities
of
fiduciaries
under
section
409
with
the
relief
provided
for
in
section
502(a)(3),
which
does
not
apply
to
fiduciaries.
409
first
says
that
a
fiduciary
is
personally
liable
for
making
good
to
the
plan
any
losses
that
the
plan
sustains
as
a
result
of
a
breach,
restoring
profits
to
the
plan
made
through
use
of
plan
assets,
and
shall
be
subject
to
such
other
equitable
or
remedial
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
conspicuously
absent
from
section
502(a)(3)
are
any
mention
of
the
so-called
make-whole
remedy
or
any
mention
of
the
term
remedial
relief.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
plan
participants
and
fiduciaries,
as
well
as
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
under
section
502(a)(2).
section
502(a)(2)
says
that
plan
participants,
fiduciaries,
and
the
secretary
of
labor
can
sue
for
appropriate
relief
under
409,
which
is
the
fiduciary
provision.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
section
(a)(5)
gives
the
secretary
of
labor
the
right
to
seek
injunctive
and
other
appropriate
equitable
relief,
just
as
section
502(a)(3)
gives
plan
participants
the
right
to
seek
injunctive--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--that's
correct.
and
money
damages,
make-whole
relief,
can
only
be
obtained
from
fiduciaries,
not
against
nonfiduciaries
like
hewitt.
erisa
was
enacted
to
establish
standards
of
conduct,
obligation,
and
responsibility
for
fiduciaries.
and
in
certain
carefully
circumscribed
areas,
it
dealt
with
nonfiduciaries
as
well.
but
what
erisa
did,
and
really
the
fundamental
distinction
around
which
this
whole
statute
is
crafted,
is
the
distinction
that
erisa
draws
between
fiduciaries
and
nonfiduciaries.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that's
correct.
to
contrast
what
erisa
did
with
fiduciaries
as
to
what
existed
at
common
law,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
at
common
law
only
trustees
were
in
a
fiduciary
relationship
with
a
trust
and
its
beneficiaries.
under
erisa,
on
the
other
hand,
not
only
are
the
trustees
in
a
fiduciary
relationship
with
the
trust,
but
erisa
deems
any
person
who
exercises
any
discretion
or
control
over
a
plan
or
its
assets
to
also
be
a
fiduciary.
what
it
does
is
it
greatly
expands
the
universe
of
accountable
persons
who
can
be
liable
for
plan
losses
under
the
statute
for
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
what
it
does,
on
the
other
hand,
is
work
a
concomitant
reduction
on
the
relief
that
can
be
obtained
from
nonfiduciaries.
and
that
is--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
properly
alleged
in
this
case,
and
we
did
make
that
argument
to
both
courts
below.
they
nevertheless
construed
the
complaint
as
if
it
contained
allegations
of
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
as
well
as
a
knowing
participation
in
it.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
the
complaint
against
the
fiduciary?
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
yes
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
502(l)
only
gives
the
secretary
of
labor
the
power
to
assess
fines.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
there
are
at
least
two
forms
of
equitable
relief
which
would
provide
the
secretary
and
the
action
that
the
secretary
brings
under
(a)(5)
with
a
monetary
recovery,
though
not
one
for
monetary
damages.
one
is
an
action
for
restitution.
if
in
bringing
the
action
under
(a)(5)
and
the
other
person
is
being
sued
for...
for
improper
conduct
in
connection
with
holding
onto
plan
assets,
the
secretary--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--the...
the
secretary
would
not
be
able
to
assess
a
civil
penalty
against
hewitt
associates--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--under
these
circumstances.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
because
there
is
no
amount
under
(a)(5)
which
could
be
awarded
as
appropriate
equitable
relief.
there's
no
equitable
remedy
that
would
provide
the
secretary,
or
the
plan
in
this
circumstance,
with
a
monetary
recovery,
as
both
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
below
found.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
i
disagree,
justice
stevens.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
appropriate
equitable
relief.
it
would
be
make-whole
relief
that's
set
forth
in
section
409
as
specific
relief
that
can
be
assessed
against
a
fiduciary.
but--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--under...
it
would
be
assessable--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--502(l),
section
2,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
as--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--they
called
it.
they
specified--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--precisely
what
could
be
recovered
against
a
fiduciary
in
section
409
and
said
that
type
of
relief
can
only
be
recovered
against
fiduciaries
for
the
benefit
of
the
plan.
what
it
said
in
section
502(a)(3)
is
that,
as
to
anyone
else
who
might
violate
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
the
only
relief
that
could
be
obtained
is
injunctive
and
other
appropriate
equitable
relief.
and
that
is
the...
that
is
where
erisa
crafts
the
distinction
between
fiduciaries
and
nonfiduciaries.
congress
recognized
that
plans
would
interact
with
professional
service
providers.
and
while
it
had
in
earlier
drafts
considered
making
actuaries
fiduciaries
under
the
statute,
it
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens,
at
common
law.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
not
what
erisa
adopted.
what
erisa
adopted
was
an
expansion
of
persons--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--and--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--no.
they
did
not
eliminate--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--the
participants.
what
they
did
is
limit
the
relief
that
could
be
obtained
against
a
person
other
than
a
fiduciary
to
equitable
or
injunctive
relief.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
well--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--well,
with
regard
to
the
common
law
precedent,
erisa
does
not
adopt
that
common
law
precedent
within
the
contours
of
either
the
structure
or
the
language
that
congress
chose.
in
number
1
in
409
and
number
2
in
502(a)(3),
what
congress
did
was
make
a
rational
decision
that
allocates
liability
in
accordance
with
responsibility,
making
the
fiduciary
the
one
who
is
responsible
for
plan
losses,
but
cut
off
the
monetary
relief
that
could
be
obtained
from
nonfiduciaries,
professional
advisors,
of...
of
money
or
property
they
might
have
obtained
from
the
plan.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
if
they
had
their
hand
in
the
plan's
till,
they
could
be
required
to
disgorge
that
money.
that
was
not
the
circumstance
here.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
yes.
by
having
included
specifically
in
409,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
what
could
be
obtained
from
a
fiduciary,
and
failing
to
include
those
words
in
section
502(a)(3),
that
omission
is
the
clearest
manifestation
that
the
relief
available
under
409
is
not
available
under
502(a)(3).
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
otherwise,
congress
would
have
said
so.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
what...
what
erisa
does,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
adopt
certain
principles
from
trust
law,
not
all
of
trust
law.
and
what
it
said
with
regard
to
fiduciaries
was
what's
said
in
409.
502(a)(3)
is
not
limited
in
terms...
to
the
terms
of
what
parties
can
be
sued
under
that
provision.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
show
is
that
by
setting
forth
what
relief
could
be
obtained
against
fiduciaries
and
not
setting
forth
what
relief,
other
than
appropriate
equitable
or
injunctive
relief,
could
be
obtained
against
nonfiduciaries
under
502(a)(3),
that
congress
was
making
a
distinction
between
the
relief
available
from
fiduciaries
and
specific...
specifically
set
it
forth
and,
in
contrast,
limited
the
relief
that
could
be
assessed
against
nonfiduciary
parties.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
indeed,
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
nieto
case,
which
underlied
the
decision
in
our
case,
recognized,
that
if
that
interpretation
were
adopted,
409
would
be
rendered
unnecessary
surplusage.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
the
second
example
is
that
when
a
fiduciary
and
a
party
in
interest
engaged
in
a
prohibited
transaction
under
the
statute,
that
is
proscribed
by
406,
the
remedy
for
that
is
correction
of
the
transaction.
basically,
putting
the
plan
back
into
the
position
it
would
have
been
in
had
the
transaction
essentially
not
taken
place.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
yes,
they
can,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
they
would
be...
they
would
be
the
forms
that
i
can
identify
of
appropriate
equitable
relief,
that
would
provide
plan
participants
or
the
plan
with
a
monetary
recovery.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
against
a
nonfiduciary.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--what
502(a)(2)
says
is
that
a
plan
participant,
fiduciary,
or
the
secretary
of
labor--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--can
bring
a
suit
for
appropriate
relief
under
409.
409
says
that
a
plan
fiduciary
who
breaches
his
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
plan
is
personally
liable,
and
that's
why
there's
the
interaction
between
the
two
provisions.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
it
does
and
it
only
identifies
fiduciaries.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
well,
it
says
plan
participants.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
well,
409
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
but
502(a)(2)
does.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
justice
stevens,
i'd...
i'd
respectfully
disagree.
section
404
sets
forth
the
duties
which
an
erisa
fiduciary
owes
to
the
plan.
section
409
sets
forth
the
liabilities
of
a
fiduciary
who
breaches
his
obligations.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
section
502(a)(2)
gives
the
parties
identified
the
right
to
bring
a
civil
action
for
relief
under
section
409,
the
liability
provision.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
i
would
agree
with
you
that
section
502(a)(2)
doesn't
identify
the
defendants
who...
(a)(3)
does
not
identify
the
defendants
who
could
be
sued.
but
i
think
when
you
read
502(a)(2)
with
section
409,
that
it's
plain
that
only
fiduciaries
could
be
the
target
of
502(a)(2)
actions.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
we
don't
agree
with
that
position,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
in
fact,
what
your
position
really
is
is
that
what
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
take
the
words
that
appear
in
409
and
imply
them
into
502(a)(3).
that
position
cannot
be
sustained,
since
it
will
result
in
destroying
a
carefully
comprehensive
structure
that
congress
crafted.
it
will
destroy
the
distinction
between
fiduciaries,
on
the
one
hand,
and
nonfiduciaries
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that...
that...
that
is
not
our...
our
position,
justice
scalia.
our
position
is
that
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
is
what
kind
of
relief
can
be
obtained
against
a
nonfiduciary.
what
cause
of
action
that
may
account
for
is
really
irrelevant.
i
should
note,
however,
that
our
amici
did
make
a
powerful
argument
that
no
knowing
participation
cause
of
action
exists
under
the
statute.
we
don't
take
a
position
on
that
because
our
focus
is
on
the
relief
that
is
available
against
a
nonfiduciary.
with
regard
to
the
balance
that
erisa
struck,
i
just
want
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
like
all
statutes,
erisa
was
the
result
of
a
balance
that
was
struck
by
congress.
they
sought
to
protect
and
promote
the
interests
of
plan
beneficiaries
and
participants
on
the
one
hand,
but
they
also,
congress,
wanted
to
encourage
the
voluntary
formation
of
employee
benefit
plans
without
unduly
increasing
costs.
now
while
plan
fiduciaries
retain
professional
service
providers,
as
the
plan
fiduciaries
in
this
case
retained
hewitt,
the
issue
is
where
does
the
line
get
drawn
between
fiduciaries
and
service
providers.
erisa
provides
that
answer.
erisa
says
that
a
plan
professional
service
provider
is
not
a
fiduciary,
so
long
as
the
service
provider
exercises
his
normal
professional
functions
and
does
not
exercise
any
discretion
or
control
over
the
administration
or...
administration
of
a
plan
or
its
assets.
here,
the
courts
below
found
that
hewitt
was
not
a
fiduciary.
what
petitioners
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
impose
fiduciary
liability
on
hewitt,
even
though
it's
been
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
that
hewitt
was
not
a
fiduciary.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
for
two
reasons.
one--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--ignoring...
ignoring
409.
what...
what...
what
erisa
says
is
that
a
person
is
either,
in
essence,
a
fiduciary
or
not
a
fiduciary.
and
given
that
erisa
expands
the
universe
of
fiduciaries,
it
says
that
only
fiduciaries
can
be
held
liable
for
losses
sustained
by
the
plan,
while
working
a
concomitant
reduction
on
what
relief
can
be
obtained
from
nonfiduciaries.
and
to
accept
a
conspiracy
or
other
theory,
one
would
have
to
conclude
that
by
conspiring
with
the
plan
fiduciaries,
then
in
essence--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--that
they
became
a
fiduciary.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that
is
a
possible
interpretation.
that
is
one
with
which
we
strongly
disagree.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
and
i
think
the
whole
structure
of
the
statute
shows
that
congress
didn't
decide
to
take
the
common
law
of
trusts
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
equity
courts
and
import
that
into
erisa.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
that...
that
issue
has
not
been
presented
to
this
court
before,
as
to
whether
actions
against
nonfiduciary
service
providers
are
preempted.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
however,
this
court
may
conclude
if
it
holds,
as
we
think
it
should,
that
money
damages
are
not
encompassed
with
appropriate
equitable
relief,
that
it
would
agree
with
the
district
court
in
this
case,
in
an
appropriate
case,
that
professional
malpractice
claims
or
common
law
tort
claims
against
nonfiduciary
service
providers
may
not
be
preempted
by
erisa.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
i
believe
that
that
is
a...
is...
would
be
consistent
with
existing
law,
although--
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
--extra
trust
claims.
i
mean,
what
obligations
are
imposed
by
the
statute
on
fiduciary...
nonfiduciary
service
providers?
i
think
there
would
a
strong
argument
that
claims
based
on
that
would
be
preempted.
mr.
steven
h.
frankel
i...
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens.
however,
whether
common
law
tort
claims
or
other
claims
against
nonfiduciary
service
providers
fall
within
the
conspicuous
breadth
of
erisa's
preemption
clause
is
really
a
matter
that
congress
may
ultimately
have
to
decide.
if,
for
example,
this
court
were
to
conclude
in
an
appropriate
case
that
such
common
law
claims
against
nonfiduciaries
would
be
preempted
and
would
leave
people
without
a
place
to
go
to
get
the
money
damages
they
might
otherwise
be
entitled
to,
but
with
which
they
cannot
obtain
it
under
erisa.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
