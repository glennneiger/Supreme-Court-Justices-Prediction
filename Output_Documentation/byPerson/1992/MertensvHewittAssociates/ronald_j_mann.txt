mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
erisa
deprived
beneficiaries
of
their
traditional
equitable
remedies
against
parties
who
knowingly
participate
in
a
breach
of
trust.
in
our
view,
the
answer
is
found
in
the
text
of
section
502(a)(3),
which
authorizes
courts
to
award
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
violations
of
erisa
and
erisa
plans.
although
compensatory
damages
normally
are
considered
legal
relief,
it
is
clear
in
the
trust
context
that
equitable
relief
includes
a
right
to
compensatory
relief
which
accordingly
should
be
available
under
section
502(a)(3).
that
reading
of
the
statute
is
bolstered
by
indications
from
related
provisions
of
the
statute,
as
well
as
the
practical
consequences
of
a
contrary
reading.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
1109...
i'm
looking
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
which
is
page
la
to
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
okay.
it
has
409(a)
and
502(a)
on
the
same
page.
409(a)
is
the
provision
which
is
in
part
4,
that
deals
with
fiduciaries,
that
establishes
the
types
of
relief
that
can
be
secured
against
fiduciaries
by
the
plan.
that
is
carried
forward
into
502(a)
and
502(a)(2),
at
which
you
look.
i
assume
that
you're
referring
to
the
phrase
409(a).
and
as
you
noted,
it
is
somewhat
different
from
the
phrase
502(a)(3),
which
is--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--the
provision
at
issue
here.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no,
no.
i
think
that...
i
think
that
what
you
look
at
is
in...
erisa,
traditionally,
has
been
understood
to
refer
to
traditional
principles
of
trust
law.
if
you
look
at
traditional
principles
of
trust
law,
the
most
likely
source
and
the
source
this
court
has
looked
at
is
the
restatement
of
trusts.
and
the
restatement
of
trusts
establishes
two
types
of
remedies.
there
are
some
legal
remedies
and
there
are
some
equitable
remedies,
and
they
are
described
in
different
sections.
in
our
view,
the
relief
under
502(a)(3),
the
reference
to
equitable
relief
should
refer
to
the
equitable
remedies
that
were
available
at
trust
law.
in
section
409
when
they
refer
to
equitable
or
remedial
relief,
we
believe
they
also
intended
to
include...
include
the
legal
remedies
that
were
available
at
trust
law.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
i...
i
share
your
view
that
remedial
relief
is...
remedial
is
probably
not
the
best
word.
i
would
assume,
though,
that
what
that
word
has
to
mean
is
a
reference
to
legal
relief,
and
what
they're
trying
to
say
is
equitable
or
legal
relief.
it
seems
to
me
remedial
is
an
adjective
that
means
having
to
do
with
relief.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
to
make
sense
out
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
assume
that
when
congress
says
equitable
in
one
place
and
equitable
or
remedial
next
to
it,
that
we
have
to
find
some
meaning
of
the
word
remedial.
and
the
most
obvious
meaning--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
no,
but
i
mean
the
most...
the
most
obvious
meaning
of...
of
the
word
in
context
is
those
things
that
are
not
equitable,
which
is
the
legal
relief
described
in
the
restatement.
and
it
also
makes
some
sense
because
if
you
look
at
the
types
of
things
that
are
legal
relief
and
are
not
equitable
relief,
they
are
actions
that
would
lie
solely
against
the
fiduciary.
and
so
it
would
make
some
sense
that
when
congress
drafted
section
409
for
remedies
against
the
fiduciary,
it
would
say
you
get
not
only
equitable
relief
but
also
the
very
limited
types
of
legal
relief
that
were
available
at
the
common
law.
in
section
502(a)(3),
which
is
not
directed
solely
at
fiduciaries,
there
would
be
no
reason
to...
to
have
that
included,
because
anything
that
you
can
get
against
a
fiduciary
has
already
been
included
in
section
409.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
ordinarily,
money
damages
are
legal
relief.
but
erisa
is
a
statute
that
is
enacted
in
the
trust
context,
and
in
the
trust
context
it's
extremely
clear...
it
is
extremely
clear
in
the
trust
context
that
equitable
relief
includes
compensatory...
you
can
call
it
compensatory
damages,
because
that's
really
what
it
is.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the...
the
restatement
describes
two
types
of
legal
relief.
one
of
them
is
for
disbursement
of
money
that
is
immediately
and
unconditionally
due
to
the
beneficiary
under
the
terms
of
the
trust.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
classic
spendthrift
trust
under
which
the
beneficiary
is
not
supposed
to
relieve
any...
receive
anything
until
he
turns
25,
and
at
25
the
corpus
of
the
trust
is
to
be
disbursed
to
him.
if
he
files
a
lawsuit,
he's
26
years
old,
he
can
go
into
a...
could
go
to
a
court
of
law
and
get
that
relief.
and
the
second
one--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--but
if
the...
but
if
the
trustee
refuses
to
give
him
the
property,
before
erisa
was
passed
he
would
have
a
lawsuit
to
get
the
property.
understandably--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--that...
that's...
that
is
exactly
right.
but
that
is
the
legal--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--the
second...
the
second
one
is
actually
quite
similar.
the
second
one
is
if
the...
if
the
thing
to
be
disbursed
is
not
money
but
a
chattel,
which,
i
mean,
has
basically
the
same
type
of
analysis.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
there...
you...
you
would
have
an
action...
in
the
restatement
it's
under
section
199(c)
and
it's
an
action...
an
action
which
actually
uses
words
very
similar
to
section
502(a)(3).
it's
an
action
to
compel
the
trustee
to
redress
a
breach
of
trust.
this...
and
if
you
look
at
the...
the
commentary
to
section
199,
it
makes
clear
that
the
relief
was
compensatory
relief.
one
of
the
examples,
for
example,
is
if
the
trustee
has
invested
money
in
a
bank
that
he
should
have
known
would
fail.
the
bank
fails,
the
money
is
no
longer
there,
the
trustee
is
personally
obligated
to
make
the
trust
whole
for
the
loss.
in...
this
case
involves
a
suit
where
the
trustee
did
not
breach
the
trust
by
himself,
but
there
is
a
person
who
knowingly
participated
with
the
trustee
in
the
breach
of
trust.
now,
at
common
law
the
understand...
before
erisa,
the
understanding
was
we
can't
expect
the
trustee
to
sue
the
person
who
participated
with
him
in
the
breach
of
trust,
so
we
will
allow
the
beneficiary
himself
to
sue
to
recover
the
money
for
the
trust.
and...
and
that
is
the
action
that's
at
issue
here,
and
that's
described
in
another
part
of
the
restatement,
in
section
326,
and
it's
also
referred
to
in
the
treatises
cited
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
the
statute
very
clearly
was
referring
to
this
particular
cause
of
action
because
section
502(a)(3)
uses
the
word
"redress",
which
is
exactly
the
word
that's
used
in
the
particular
section
of
the
restatement
and
the
natural
meaning
of
the
word,
if
you
look
in
dictionaries,
is
to
compensate
or
to
pay
back.
one
further
point
i'd
like
to
make,
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
key
considerations
in
this
case,
is
the
practical
consequences
of
a
contrary
reading
of
the
statute.
erisa
has
its
remedies
for...
civil
remedies
set
forth
in
section
502(a),
which
this
court
has
described
as
very
comprehensive.
except
for
section
502(a)(3),
there
is
no
provision
that
generally
allows
a
civil
action
to
recover
for
a
breach
of
erisa.
there
are
quite
a
number
of
important
provisions
of
erisa
for
which
there
is
simply
no
remedy
outside
of
section
502(a)(3).
we
could
look
at
the
provision
at
issue
in
ingersoll-rand,
for
example,
which
made
it
a
violation
of
erisa
to
fire
an
employee
to
prohibit
his
pension
plan
from
vesting.
if
individuals
who
are
harmed
by
violations
of
those
provisions
cannot
sue
under
section
502(a)(3)
for
compensatory
damages,
then
erisa
has
effectively
left
them
without
a
remedy.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
the
secretary
can
bring
a
suit,
but
those...
but
those...
that
suit,
under
section
502(a)(5),
is
also
for
appropriate
equitable
relief.
and
if
equitable--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no.
but
the
problem
is
that
there's
no
remedy.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
just
because
the
secretary
can
sue
doesn't
mean
the
individual
is
without
a
remedy.
but
the
secretary
has
no
greater
right
to
compensatory
damages
than
the
individual.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
i...
i
understand.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
respondents
have
conceded
that...
that
persons
other
than
fiduciaries
can
be
sued
under
section
502(a)(3).
the
issue
really
is
whether
in
their...
is
whether
or
not
you
can
get
compensatory
relief.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
it's...
it's
section
404.
section
404
establishes
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--right.
it's
the
duty
of
care
for
fiduciaries.
but
as
i
was
explaining,
in
considering
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--okay.
there
are...
there
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
answer
is
if
you
look
at
section
502(a)(3),
and
in
particular
at
502(a)(3)(b)(i),
this
is
on
page
la
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the...
the
relief
is
to
redress
the
violation.
and
we
submit
that
in
determining
what
is
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
the
violation,
you
should
look
to
what
relief
was
available
before
erisa
was
passed
under
principles
of
equity,
which
includes
relief
against
not
only
the
fiduciary,
but
against
a
third
party.
the
second
point,
which
is
very
important,
is
that
section
502(l)(1)(a),
(l)(1)(b),
makes
it
a
violation
of
erisa
for
another
person
to
knowingly
participate
in
a
breach.
so
at
least
in
this
type
of
situation,
the
party
has
violated
erisa
because,
if
nothing
else,
he's
violated
section
502(l)(1)(b).
