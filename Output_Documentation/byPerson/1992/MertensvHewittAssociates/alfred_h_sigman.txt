mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
court
with
the
issue
of
whether
a
person
who
knowingly
participates
in
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
under
erisa
is
liable
to
restore
losses
suffered
by
a
retirement
plan.
in
1987,
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
imposed
a
distress
termination
on
the
kaiser
steel
retirement
plan
because
of
what
it
described
at
the
time
as
its
gross
underfunding.
petitioners,
and
all
other
retirees
similarly
situated,
suffered
substantial
losses
in
their
retirement
income.
mr.
mertens,
for
example,
suffered
a
reduction
in
his
monthly
benefit
from
$2,000
to
$500.
petitioners
brought
this
action
to
recover
all
losses
to
the
plan.
petitioners
sued
the
plan's
fiduciaries,
officials
of
kaiser,
for
allegedly
breaching
their
fiduciary
duties
to
the
plan,
and
also
sued
the
plan's
actuary,
in
a
separate
action
which
the
district
court
consolidated,
for
allegedly
knowingly
participating
in
that
fiduciary
breach.
essentially,
plaintiffs
allege
that
the
kaiser
fiduciaries
and
hewitt
acted
together
to
purposefully
underfund
the
plan
by
failing
to
change
the
plan's
actuarial
assumptions
to
reflect
kaiser's
decision
to
essential
terminate
its
steel-making
operations.
as
a
consequence
of
that
decision,
a
great
number
of
kaiser
employees
were...
were
forced
to
take
full
early
retirement
benefits,
which
in
turn
greatly
increased
the
funding
costs
to
the
plan.
because
kaiser
did
not
fund
the
plan
in
a
manner
to
pay
for
the
increased
retirements
caused
by
the
closing
down
of
its
steel
operations,
the
plan
became
insolvent.
i'd
like
to
argue
three
points
to
the
court
today,
the
first
being
that
under
erisa
section
502(a)(3),
which
provides
for
all
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
violations
of
the
act,
that
that
statute
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
redress
against
a
person
who
knowingly
participates
in
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
and
that
principle
also
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
common
law
of
trusts,
which
should
be
incorporated
into
erisa.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
argue
that
when
congress
in
1989
enacted
the
so-called
obra
amendment
to
erisa,
it
made...
which
had
explicitly
referred
to
a
preexisting
underlying
cause
of
action
under
section
502
for
recovery
of
losses
to
a
plan
caused
by
any
person
who
knowingly
participates
in
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
that
that
amendment
had
confirmed
that
the
right
on
the
part
of
participants
and
beneficiaries
to
sue
knowing
participants
in
fiduciary
breaches
had
always
existed
under
section
502.
finally,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
the
liability
that
we
argue
for
here
today
is
essential
in
order
to
further
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
primary
function
being
to
deter
fiduciary
breaches
in
the
first
place,
so
as
to
secure
the
interests
of
retirees
in
their
pension
benefits.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
well,
in
fact
we
did
raise
a
claim
under
state
law.
we
sued
hewitt
for
malpractice
under
state
law.
and
after
this
court
granted
certiorari,
the
district
court
denied
hewitt's
motion
to
mission
on
preemption
grounds.
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
in
part's
going
to
depend
on
the
resolution
of
this
case.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
however,
that
erisa
does
provide
specifically
that
plans
can
be
sued
and
can
sue.
and
there
are
many
instances
where
district
courts
have
held
that
malpractice
actions
against
attorneys,
against
other
service
providers
to
plans,
are
not
preempted.
but,
once
again,
that
issue
is
not
presented
by
this
case
because
hewitt
did
not
raise
it
until
after
the
cert
petition
had
been
granted.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
we
contend
that
the
respondent,
hewitt,
violated...
that...
that
the
violation
involved
was
the
violation
of
the
fiduciaries
to
adequately
fund
the
plan.
and
we
contend
that
502(a)(3)
is
broad
enough,
because
it
is
an
open-ended
provision,
to
provide
relief
against
hewitt
for
aiding
and
abetting
the
fiduciaries
in
that
violation.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
that
would
be
section
404
and
409,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
right.
section
404
broadly
sets
forth
the
fiduciary
standards
of
erisa
and
409
is
the
provision
of
the
act
which
provides
for
an
action
against
fiduciaries
on
behalf
of
the
plan.
congress
provided
in
section
502(a)(3)
of
erisa
that
pension
plan
participants
and
beneficiaries
could
recover,
in
addition
to
the
remedies
explicitly
set
forth
in
that
section,
other
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
erisa
violations.
the
wording
is
very
broad.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
i
would
say
that
damages,
for
example,
for
emotional
distress
would
be
excluded
from
that...
by
that
term.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
to
redress.
i
think
that
that's--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the...
that
the
limitation
is,
first,
there
must
be
a
violation.
and
i
think
that
the
limitation
relates
to...
to
the
remedy.
in
other
words,
the...
the
502(a)(3)
provides
that--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--well,
in
this
case
we'd
say
make-whole
relief,
and
we
say
that
make-whole
relief
is
encompassed
within
the
adjective,
within
the
term
equitable
relief,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
equitable
relief
traditionally
has
encompassed
make-whole
relief
in
situations
such
as
this.
beneficiaries
of
a
trust
who
are
wronged
by
the
fiduciaries
have
historically
had
the
relief...
had
the
relief
available
to
them
to
be
restored,
to
be
made
whole.
exactly,
your
honor.
and
i'd
point
out
that
we're
not
seeking
money
directly
for
the
individuals
affected.
we're
seeking
money
on
behalf
of
the
plan.
we're
seeking
to
restore
losses
to
the
plan,
and
that
is
an
appropriate
equitable
remedy,
one
which
congress
had
intended
the
courts
to
apply
when--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--we
are
saying
that
make-whole
relief
is
available.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
well,
we're
saying
what
would
not
be
available
would
be
relief
available
to
the
participants
of
the
plan
for
the
emotional
injuries
that
they've
suffered
as
a
result
of
having
their
pension
reduced
so
substantially,
that
that
would
be
excluded,
for
example,
your
honor.
we're
saying--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--that
punitive
damages
would
be
excluded.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
we're
saying
that
the
limitation
imposed
is--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--yes.
(a)(5)
gives
the
secretary
the
power
to
bring
a
suit--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--no.
it's
equitable
relief.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
the
term
equitable
was
mistakenly
omitted
from
the...
from
our
briefs.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
on
my
part.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
yes,
yes.
(a)(3)
and
(a)(5),
in
terms
of
the
release...
relief
available,
is
identical.
and
equitable
relief
is
provided
for
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
mistake,
the
omission
in
the
brief.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
i'm
sorry
to
disappoint
the
court.
[laughter]
as
this
court
has
stated
in
the
firestone
case,
erisa's
legislative
history
further
demonstrates
that
congress
had
intended
federal
courts
to
develop
federal
common
law
in
fashioning
the
additional
appropriate
equitable
relief
described
in
section
502.
the
legislative
history
also
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
to
engraft
traditional
trust
law
principles
into
erisa's
remedial
scheme.
moreover,
a
fundamental
concept
of
trust
law
is
that
courts
will
give
to
the
beneficiaries
of
a
trust
those
remedies
which
are
necessary
to...
for
the
protection
of
their
interests.
and
it's
also
a
fundamental
concept
and
principle
of
trust
law
that
a
knowing
participant
in
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
as
responsible
as
the
fiduciary
for
the
breach.
in
this
particular
case,
the
relief
which
we
urged
the
court
to
approve
is
essential
in
order
to
fulfill
the
act's
remedial
purposes,
among
the
most
important
being
to
deter
fiduciary
breaches
which
frequently
could
not
happen
without
the
assistance
of
a
knowing
participant
in
that
breach.
in
addition,
as
i've
stated
earlier
the
fundamental
and
most
important
remedial
feature
of
erisa
is
to
assure
the
interests
of
retirees
in
the
pension
benefits
that
they
were
promised
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
imposing
the
liability
which
we
seek
here
on
knowing
participants
would
thereby
further
erisa's
remedial
goals.
it
would
eliminate
any
incentive
that
a
nonfiduciary
might
have
to
assist
or
to
induce
a
fiduciary
to
breach
his
erisa
responsibilities.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
obra
argument,
if
i
may.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
409,
your
honor,
also
demonstrates
that
that
relief
can
encompass
monetary
relief.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
because
the...
at
the
beginning
of
the
section
it
says
"shall
be
personally
liable
to
make
good
to
such
plan
any
losses
to
the
plan
resulting
from
each
such
breach.
"
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
"and
to
restore
to
such
plan
any
profits--
"
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
i
would
say
that
the
statute
could
have
been
more
carefully
crafted.
for
example,
the...
for
the
phrase
"equitable
or
remedial
relief",
i
don't
really
think,
frankly,
that
there's
much
difference
between
equitable
and
remedial.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
it
sounds...
i
believe
that
it's
a
redundant
phrase.
but
i
do
think,
despite
the
sloppiness
in
the
drafting
of
the
statute,
that
409
does
establish
that
it's
appropriate
to
seek
relief
which
would
provide
all
losses
or
restore
all
losses
lost
to
the
plan.
in
the
1989
obra
amendment
to
erisa,
which
added
a
new
subsection,
502(l),
congress--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
actually,
it...
it
could
go
beyond
just
the
amount
of
the
underfunding
into
the
plan.
we're
seeking
to...
relief
which
would
make
the
plan
whole.
and,
in
other
words,
we're
seeking
relief
that
would
result
in
a
full
benefit,
a
full
retirement
benefit,
as
originally
provided
for
in
the
terms
of
the
plan,
to
the
retirees
of
the
plan.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
well,
it's
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
but
in
terms
of
the
out-of-pocket
loss
which
my
clients
have
suffered--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--well,
because
the
pbgc
has
taken
over
the
plan,
the
whole
group
has
not
suffered
economic
loss.
of
the
approximately
2,000
participants
in
the
plan,
only
143
fell
above
the
threshold
that
the
pbgc
has
required...
in
other
words,
the
pbgc
will
pay
a
full
benefit
to
each
participant
or
retiree--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--the
pbgc
is
in
the
litigation
but
it
did
not
appeal.
the
pbgc
is
not
here
today.
the
pbgc--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--well,
the
pbgc
is
now
the
statutory
trustee
of
the
plan.
and
it
is
surprising
that
the
pbgc
was
so
disinterested
as
not
to
appeal
this
issue.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
once
again,
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
in
the
context
of
the
litigation,
the
pbgc
produced
what
it
called
a
termination
report,
indicating
that
the
losses
to
the
plan
were
in
excess
of
$50
million.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
that's
correct.
my
clients--
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
--jointly
and
severally
liable
with
the
fiduciaries.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
correct.
the
company
itself,
kaiser,
was
also,
we
contended,
a
fiduciary
of
the
plan.
but
given
the
fact
that
kaiser
was
in
bankruptcy,
we
did
not
bring
suit
against
kaiser
originally.
just
very
briefly
in
terms
of
the
obra
argument,
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
obra
argument
provides
that
the
secretary
may
impose
a
civil
penalty,
not
only
on
a
fiduciary
who
commits
a
breach,
but
also
on
any
other
person
who
knowingly
participates
in
such
a
breach.
the
civil
penalty
was
set
at
20
percent
of
the
recovery
amount,
which
was
defined
in
the
statute
as
an
amount
recovered
by
the
secretary
in
an
action
brought
by
him
under
section
502(a)(2)
or
(a)(5).
the
obra
amendment,
we
contend,
also
confirms
that
the
term
appropriate
equitable
relief
includes
the
remedy
of
restoring
all
losses
to
the
plan.
under
obra
the
secretary
may
reduce
or
waive
the
civil
penalty
if
he
finds
that
its
imposition
would
impair
the
ability
of
the
fiduciary
or,
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
other
person,
to
restore
all
losses
to
the
plan.
we
believe
that
that
demonstrates
that
congress'
primary
purpose
was
to
assure
that
losses
to
the
plan
would
be
restored,
and
not
only
restored
by
the
breaching
fiduciary,
but
restored
also
by
those
who
knowingly
participate
or
participated
in
the
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
in
closing,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
so
as
to
leave
these
retirees
in
a
position
that
is
better
than
they
would
have
been
in,
rather
than
worse
than
they
would
have
been
in
prior
to
the
enactment
of
erisa.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
exactly.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
the
secretary
is
authorized
under
section
502(a)(5),
and
502(a)(5)
has
the
identical
language
as
502(a)(3).
it
would
be,
indeed,
anomalous
if
the
liability
of
a
knowing
participant
would
be
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
is
the
secretary
of
labor
or
if
the
plaintiff
is
the
individual
plan
participant
or
the
fiduciary.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
alfred
h.
sigman
the
case...
we
submit
the
case,
your
honor.
