justice
byron
r.
white
and
it...
it
says
"any
other
appropriate
relief",
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--still
is
equitable
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
interesting.
i
thought
you
were
going...
i
thought
we
could
make
the
big
argument
about
congress
must
have
intended
something
different.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
hold
it
a
second.
who
was
the
secretary
referred
to
in...
in
(l)?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
secretary
are
we
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
secretary
of
labor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
permitted
to
bring...
bring
the
kind
of
a
suit
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--we're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can't
the
secretary
bring
a
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
just
because
a
beneficiary
couldn't
sue
him
or
herself
doesn't
mean
that
he
or
she
is
without
a
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
different
argument,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
it
never...
it
never
includes
money...
it
never
includes
a
remedy
which...
which
is...
is
a
recovery
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
so
you're
going
on
damages,
dama--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--can
you
get...
but
you
can
get
a
money
judgment
on...
in
equity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
you
can
find
in
erisa
an
intention
to
narrow
the
meaning
of,
quote,
equitable
relief,
unquote?
justice
byron
r.
white
who...
who
can
sue
to
enforce
409?
justice
byron
r.
white
under...
under
what
provision
does
the
secretary
of
labor
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
section
(5),
(a)(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
part
of...
the
only
part
of
section
(a)
that...
that
provides
for
recovery
of
money
from
a
fiduciary
is
(a)(2).
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the...
who
is
not
himself
a
fiduciary.
well
what
do
you
about...
what
do
you
do
about
502(l),
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it's
measured
by...
by
the
applicable...
by
20
percent
of
the
applicable
recovery
amount,
which
is
the
amount
recovered
from
a
fiduciary
or
other
person
ordered
by
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there's...
what
if...
what
if
the
other
person
is
the
person
who
got
sued
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
plus--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yep.
and
so
you
think
the
congress
allowed
this
make-whole
recovery
against
the
fiduciary
not
as
equitable
relief
but
as--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
they
called
it
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
immediately.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
frankel,
is
it...
we
have
erisa
cases
coming
out
our
ears
these
days.
[laughter]
and
i'm
glad
to
find
that
there's
a
section
here
that
is
crystal
clear.
or
at
least
allegedly
so.
mr.
frankel,
clarify
your
last
answer.
you...
you
are
of
the
position
that
any...
any
common
law
state
action
against
nonfiduciaries
based
on
trust
obligations
are
precluded.
