mr.
frankel,
you
were
giving
us,
quite
some
time
ago,
two
examples
of
monetary
but
not...
of
equitable
relief
which
was
monetary
but
not
damages,
and
you
gave
one
example
as
restitution.
what's
your
second
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
either
of
those
forms
of
monetary
relief
be
recovered
under
erisa
against
a
nonfiduciary?

second
one
could
not,
i
presume.
