justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it's...
it's
very
broad,
but
not
universal.
it...
it
does
say
other
appropriate
equitable
relief.
what
do
you
deem
to
be
excluded
by
that
adjective
equitable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
simply
because
there's...
that
doesn't
go
to
the
relief,
it
goes
to
where
there's
a
cause
of
action,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
relief
for
an
available
cause
of
action
is
excluded
by...
by
putting
in
the
term
equitable?
now,
the
other
side
has...
you
know,
has
an
explanation.
it
says,
you
know,
equitable
relief
doesn't
include
money
damages.
but
you
say
it
includes
any
relief
that
could
be
provided--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to...
but...
but
to
redress
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
since
that
breach
would
be
sued
for
in
a
court
of
equity,
and
therefore
any
relief
provided
would
be
equitable
relief.
so
then
why
would
you
put
in
the
adjective?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
tell
me
what
remedy
would
otherwise
be
available
but
for
this
adjective
equitable?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
so...
so
you
might
as
well
have
dropped
the
adjective.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
make-whole
relief.
you...
you
say
make-whole
relief
is
not
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
relief
is
available.
what
isn't
available?
i'm
not
looking
for
what
is
available.
what
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
excluded
not...
not
because
of
the...
the
manner
of
relief,
but
because
there...
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
them.
i
mean
it
seems...
this
is
a
remedial
section.
it...
it's
talking
about
what
kind
of
relief
to
address
violations.
well,
nevermind.
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time.
well,
a
short
answer,
i
suppose,
is
that
inequitable
relief
is
excluded.
[laughter]
or
inappropriate
equitable
relief.
and
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
(a)(5),
where
it
gives
the
secretary
the
power
to
sue,
doesn't
it?
isn't
it
(a)(5)?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
do
you...
what
do
you
refer
to
when
you
say
you...
legal
relief
does
not
mean
to
you
money
damages;
money
damages
against
the
fiduciary
is
not
legal
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
what...
what
is
the
legal
relief
that's
available
in
the
trust
context
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
no
longer
available.
i...
i
mean
the
trust
is
over,
the
trust
is
at
an
end.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
lawsuit
under
the
trust,
however.
it's
a
lawsuit
quite
apart
from
the
trust,
so
of
course
it's
at
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
what's...
what's
the
second
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
only
a
duty
on
the
fiduciaries.
where...
where
is
the
duty
created
on
the
part
of
the
nonfiduciaries?
i
mean
you
have
a
section
409(a)
which
creates
a
duty
on
the
part
of
fiduciaries.
it
gives
a
cause
of
action.
where...
where
is
the
section
that
would
be
the
equivalent
creating
a
duty
and
a
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
nonfiduciaries.
it
just
isn't
there,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
in
essence,
that
the
word
equitable
relief
does
not
mean
all
relief
that
a
court
of
equity
in
these
circumstances
could
give.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
there's
a
difference
between
equitable
relief
and
the
relief
which
a
trust...
court
supervising
a
trust,
which
happens
to
be
a
court
of
equity,
can
provide.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frankel,
am
i...
am
i
correct...
i
don't
recall
whether
you
made
the
argument,
i
guess
i
should
have
asked
the
other
side,
but
they
have
very
little
time
left.
in...
it
would
not
have
been...
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
mention
the
secretary...
in
(a)(2),
which
says
that
the
secretary,
a
participant,
or
a
beneficiary
or
fiduciary
can
sue
under
409(a),
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
mention
the
secretary
in...
in
1132(a)(2)
if
(a)(3)
and
(a)(5)
mean
what
the
government
says
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
(a)(5)
would
automatically...
if
it
included
all
relief,
legal
as
well
as
equitable,
the
secretary
would
have
all
the
power
he
needed
under...
under
(5)
and
he
wouldn't
have
to
have
been
given
anything
under
(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess...
is
it
true
that
if...
if
502(a)(3)
means
what
the
government
says
it
means,
you
would
not
have
needed
409(a)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
all?
if
it
includes...
if...
if...
if
502(a)(3)
includes
all
the
equitable
relief
in
the
sense
of
whatever
trust...
whatever
courts
of
equity
remedying
breaches
of
trust
could
give
in
the
past,
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
have
409(a).
because
all
of
that
stuff
that's
recited
in
40...
409(a)
is
nothing
more
than
standard
trust
remedies
for
breach
of
trust.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
even
a
more
bitter
pill
to
swallow.
no,
you're...
you're
saying
that
at
least
you
can
get
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
saying
if
you
were
rigidly...
rigidly
logical,
and
i
would
say
reckless.
[laughter]
you
would...
you
would
probably
argue
that
you
can't
get
anything
from
nonfiduciaries
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
are
willing
to
imply
into...
into
502(a)(3)
the
cause
of
action
that's
set
forth
in
409(a),
just
not
the
remedies.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
thing
you're
conceding
is
that
there
may
be
some
tort
claims
against
them
or
some
extra
trust
claims
remaining.
