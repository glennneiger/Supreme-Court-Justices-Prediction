chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1671,
william
j.
mertens
v.
hewitt
associates.
mr.
sigman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let...
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
sigman,
if
i
may,
section
409(a)
talks
about
the
liability
of...
of
a
fiduciary.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
as
to
him,
a
court
can
offer...
can
order...
he
is
subject
to
such
equitable
or
remedial
relief
as
the
court
may
deem
appropriate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it's...
it's
phrased
in
the...
in
the
disjunctive
there.
is...
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
502(a),
section
(1)(3),
if
the
civil
action
brought
by
a
participant
benefit
a
fiduciary,
that
can
be
brought
to
obtain
other
appropriate
equitable
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
in
one...
in
509
it
talks
about
equitable
or
remedial
relief,
then
this
section
talks
about
appropriate
equitable
relief.
do
you
think
congress
was
really
being
careful
in
the
terms
it
used?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
just
sounds
like
someone
was
talking
off
the
top
of
their
head
that
had
been
to
first
year
law
school.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sigman.
mr.
mann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mann,
if
you
go
to
the
subsection
immediately
before
the
one
you're
talking
about,
section
502(a)(1)(2),
i
guess,
is
where
it
talks
about
"a
civil
action
may
be
brought
by
the
secretary
or
by
a
participant
for
appropriate
relief
under
section
1109.
"
what
does
1109
provide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i'm
looking
at.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
then
502(a)(2)
speaks
simply
about
appropriate
relief
without
using
the
term
equitable.
so
we
have
in
409(a)
equitable
or
remedial
used
in
the
disjunctive.
in
subsection
(2),
appropriate
relief
without
any
modifying
adjective.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
in
(3)
we
have
appropriate
equitable
relief.
are
we
talking
about
three
different
things?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
remedial
relief
mean
that
the
word
relief
by
itself
wouldn't
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
means
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
just
kind
of
throwing
up
your
hands.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
mr.
frankel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
argument
for
your
construction
of
502(a)(3),
that
appropriate
equitable
relief
doesn't
include
the
sort
of
relief
that
a
beneficiary
could
have
gotten
from
a
trustee
in
a
court
of
equity,
is
based
on
what
section
409(a)
does
set
out
as
to
what
can...
what
the...
can
happen
to
a
fiduciary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
why...
why
should
the
language
in
409(a)
narrow
what
would
otherwise
be
the
ordinary
construction
of
appropriate
equitable
relief
in
(a)(3).
if
that
is
the...
the
ordinary
construction
of
equitable
relief,
that
you
could
get
some
sort
of
make-whole
relief
if
you
were
a
beneficiary,
from
a
trustee,
from
a
court
of
equity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frankel.
mr.
sigman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
