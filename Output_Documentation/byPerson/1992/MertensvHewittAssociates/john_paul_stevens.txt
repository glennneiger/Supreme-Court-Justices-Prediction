justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question
before
you
go
on
to
the
other
argument?
your
claim
is
that
the...
the
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation,
not
exactly
negligence
but
the
work
of
the
actuary
in
combination
with
the
fiduciary,
caused
the
plan
to
be
underfunded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
the
relief
that
you're
asking
for
that
those
individuals
should
pay
the
amount
of
the
underfunding
into
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
we
talking
about
in
dollars?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not...
not
the
individuals.
i'm
talking
about
the...
the
whole
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
the
pbgc
have
a
subrogation
claim
against
the
actuary
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
theoretically,
i
would
think,
they
would
be
entitled...
don't
they
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the...
of
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out,
if
you
can
tell
me
just
in
rough
figures,
is
by
how
much
was
the
plan
underfunded,
which
i
suppose
would
measure
the
aggregate
potential
liability
in
this
kind
of
a
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
$50
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
actuary
would
be
liable
for
that
amount
if
your
theory
is
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the...
and
all
of
whom
are
individuals,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
opponent
doesn't
agree
the
secretary
has
a
claim,
does
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
thing...
but
what
was
the
common
law
legal
remedy
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
such
as...
as
alleged
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
thing
to
be
sure
i'm
right?
under
502(a)(3),
it's
for
violations
of
a
plan
or
a
provision
of
this
subchapter.
of
course,
this
is
a
violation
of
the
subchapter
we're
talking
about,
and
what
is
the
section
of
the
subchapter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
404
is
what
is
the...
is
the
duty-creating
section
that
was
violated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just...
may
i
just
get
one
thing
clear
in
my
mind.
do
you
agree
that
the
pleadings
here
allege
a
cause
of
action
against
the...
i
mean
if
they
were
named
as
parties
to,
i
know
they're
not.
but
if
the
fiduciaries
with
whom
the
actuary
is
alleged
to
have
conspired
were
parties,
would...
would
there
be
a...
would
a
cause
of
action
have
been
stated
against
them
under
the
statute,
seeking
relief
in
the
nature
of
recoupment
to
the
trust
of
the
amount
that
was
lost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the...
if
the
complaint
is
in
proper
form,
would
you
concede
that,
under
the
statute,
that
complaint
would
state
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
only
issue
is...
is
whether
it
also
states
a
cause
of
action
against
a
knowing
participant--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
may
i
question
that
in
this
respect?
supposing
the
action
were
against
the
fiduciary
itself,
or
himself
or
herself?
then
the
recovery
would
be
in
amount
of
the
underfunding
or
whatever
it
might
be.
that
would
be
appropriate
equitable
relief
against
the
fiduciary,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me...
may
i
just
back
up
a
little.
let's
go
to
common
law
for
a
second
and
take
the
example
that
the
solicitor
general
suggested
of
poor
investment,
negligence
in
making
investments
in
conspiracy
with
an
investment
broker.
the
two
of
them
together
are
just
stupid
or
what...
they
commit
the
fiduciary
obligation.
as
i...
as
i
remember
it,
at
common
law
the...
they
could
be
jointly
and
severally
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
equitable
relief
at
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
theory
that
they
made
more
people
fiduciaries
and
therefore...
thereby--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--eliminated
the
participants
with
the
fiduciaries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
professionals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
as
long
as
you
say
equitable
you're
still
picking
up
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
common
law
precedent
that
i
suggested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question
about
whether
there's
redundancy
between
409
and
502.
is
it
not
correct
that
409
is
a
duty-defining
section,
as
is
404
and
406,
whereas
502
is
the
provision
that
identifies
the
parties
who
may
seek
relief
and
the
like?
and
you
read
502,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
as
saying
a
civil
action
may
be
brought
against
a
fiduciary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
words
aren't
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
say...
409
doesn't
identify
the
universe
of
prospective
plaintiffs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
those
are
defendants.
i
said
doesn't...
it
doesn't
identify
plaintiffs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
502.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
can
look
at
the
scheme
as
saying
409
is...
4
in
general,
404,
5,
6,
defines
the
various
duties
of
the
trustee,
and
502
defines
the
various
remedies
available
to
parties
who
may
sue
either
on
behalf
of
the
plan
or
themselves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it...
is
it
correct
that...
that
you
read
502
as
saying
a
civil
action
may
be
brought
against
a
fiduciary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
qualifies
everything
that
follows--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
interesting.
i
hadn't
noticed
before,
but
nothing
in
the
statute
identifies
either
the
potential
defendants
who
may
be
sued
or
may
not
be
sued.
it
just
simply
says
who
can
sue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
argument.
of
course,
you
know,
if
you
want
to
be
rigorously
logical,
i
suppose
you...
you
would
say
that
409(a)
creates
rights
of
action
for...
against
the
fiduciary
and
there
is
nothing
creating
rights
of
action
against
nonfiduciaries.
so
you
would
say
that
(3)
doesn't
even
allow
any
equitable
relief
against
nonfiduciaries
period.
but
that's
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
state
what
i
understand
to
be...
i
didn't
understand
from
the
briefs,
quite
frankly,
but
in
response
to
my
last
question
to
mr.
mann,
he
said
the
provision
of
the
subchapter
that
they
said
was
violated
was
404.
and
that...
you
then
read
502(a)
is
saying
"a
civil
action
may
be
brought
by
a
participant.
"
and
so
forth,
"to
enjoin
any
act
or
practice
that
violates
any
provision
of
this
subchapter.
"
namely
404,
"and
to
obtain",
blank,
blank,
blank,
"appropriate
equitable
relief".
now,
why
can't
that...
why
can't
"appropriate
equitable
relief"
in
such
an
action
include
conspirators
with
the
fiduciary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ignoring
409
entirely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
became
a
fiduciary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
either
you
have
to
conclude
that
or
conclude
that
congress
meant
by
the
words
appropriate
relief,
relief
that
would
have
been
appropriate
under
common
law
precedents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
disagree,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position
on
the
preemption
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier?
does
a
cause
of
action
remain
against
the
actuary
at...
under
state
law,
or
has
it
been
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
question...
i
know
it
hasn't...
and
i
know
it
isn't
before
us,
but
it
affects
our
thinking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
question
will
be
whether
that
action
relates
to
an
erisa
plan,
the
way
this
court's
been
construing
this.
