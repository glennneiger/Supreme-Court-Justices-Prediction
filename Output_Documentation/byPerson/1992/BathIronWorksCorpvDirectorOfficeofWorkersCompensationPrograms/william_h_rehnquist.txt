mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
as
a
practical
matter,
you
know,
if
i'm
exposed
to
something
that
causes
me
to
lose
my
hearing
and
i
find
i
used
to
be
able
to
hear
justice
blackmun
quite
well
when
he
whispered
to
me,
but
now
i
can't
hear
him
at
all,
i
don't
need
a
hearing
test
to
tell
me
that
i've
lost
my
hearing,
do
i?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
the
only
way
that
something...
a
disease
or
injury
can
manifest
itself
is
if
there's
some
medical
test
that
is
performed
to
show
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
i
break
my
arm.
that
manifests
itself
rather
dramatically,
doesn't
it,
without
necessarily
going
to
a
hospital
and
having
an
x-ray?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gillis.
mr.
lupton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
have
a
case
of
controversy
before
us
if
it's
a
matter
of
indifference
to
your
client?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lupton.
