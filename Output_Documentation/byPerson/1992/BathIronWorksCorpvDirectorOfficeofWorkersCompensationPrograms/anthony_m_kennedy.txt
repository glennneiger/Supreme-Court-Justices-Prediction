justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
a
problem
that's
a
slightly...
it's
a
threshold
problem
on
this
same
section
while
you're
on
it.
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
but
i
have
trouble
seeing
why
is
this
an
occupational
disease
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
an
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
a
hearing
loss
is
an
occupational
disease
as
opposed
to
an
accidental
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
the
act
in
902
define
accidental
injury
and
occupational
disease
as
two
different
things?
i'm
just
having
trouble
applying
the
statute
at
all.
if
you
could
get
over
this
threshold
problem,
i'm
sure
there's
an
answer
to
it.
then
we
could
pursue
the
question
as
to
when
it
occurs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
still
a
difference
between
an
occupational
disease
on
the
one
hand
and
an
injury
on
the
other--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
that
this
statute
does
is
to
talk
about
occupational
injuries,
so
that
you're
not
within
it
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
910(i).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
have
addressed
this
subject
specifically.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
agree,
i
take
it...
or
do
you
+/?
that
loss
of
hearing
is
an
occupational
disease.
