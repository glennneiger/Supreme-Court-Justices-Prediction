mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act
as
amended
in
1984,
as
it
applies
to
claims
by
retired
workers
for
occupational
hearing
loss.
the
facts
are
quite
simple.
mr.
brown,
the
plaintiff,
worked
for
the
employer,
bath
iron
works,
in
bath,
maine,
from
1939
until
his
retirement
in
1972.
in
1985,
13
years
after
his
retirement,
he
filed
a
claim
for
occupational
hearing
loss
under
the
act.
that
claim
was
based
upon
an
audiogram
taken
in
1983,
which
showed
an
84
percent
hearing
loss.
that
award
was
made
under
section
908(c)(13)
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
the
issue
as
presented
is
whether
certain
amendments
to
the
act
in
1984
applying
to
occupational
disease
claims
by
retirees
should
have
been
applied
to
determine
this
worker's
claim,
or
this
worker's
benefit.
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
below
held
that
the
occupational
disease
amendments
in
1984
were
not
applicable
to
hearing
loss
claims
and
would
not
affect
this
case.
previously,
the
administrative
law
judge
on
the
benefits
review
board
of
the
department
of
labor
had
held
in
this
case
that
the
occupational
disease
law
amendments
would
apply
for
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
the
average
weekly
wage
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
benefits,
but
that
they
were
otherwise
not
applicable
to
hearing
loss
claims.
in
other
cases,
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits
have
held
that
the
occupational
disease
amendments
in
1984
do
apply
to
hearing
loss
claims
and
subsequently
the
department's
benefits
review
board
earlier
this
year
reversed
itself
and
has
agreed
with
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits.
our
position
is
that
the
amendments
do
apply.
in
order
to
analyze
the
problem,
it
is
necessary
to
review
the
statute
as
it
existed
prior
to
1984
and
the
case
law
under
the
pre-'84
statute.
prior
to
the
amendments,
the
statute
provided
for
two
basic
types
of
disability
benefits.
the
one
would
be
a
nonscheduled
award,
or
an
award
for
economic
disability.
that
comes
into
play
when
the
worker
is
disabled
by
injury
or
disease
from
performing
his
regular
work.
he
could
have
received
benefits
for
total
or
partial
benefits
which
could
be
temporary
or
permanent.
the
second
basic
type
of
award
is
a
so-called
scheduled
award,
found
in
sections
908(c)(1)
through
(20).
that
award
compensates
the
worker
for
specific
losses
of
bodily
parts
or
bodily
functions
or
percentages
of
loss.
among
the
types
of
scheduled
award
is
a
hearing
loss
under
section
908(c)(13).
early
in
1984,
the
benefits
review
board
issued
two
decisions
having
to
do
with
retirees
claiming
occupational
diseases.
the
first
was
aduddell
v.
owens-corning.
in
that
case,
the
worker
had
developed
asbestos-related
disease
but
had
retired
before
the
disease
became
manifest.
it
was
ruled
that
the
worker
was
not
entitled
to
a
nonscheduled
disability
benefit
because
of
his
status
as
a
retiree,
the
reasoning
being
that
because
he
had
retired
he
was
out
of
the
labor
force
and
it
was
inappropriate
to
provide
him
with
a
disability
benefit.
less
than
a
month
later,
the
board
decided
redick
v.
bethlehem
steel,
which
was
a
claim
by
a
retired
worker
for
benefits
under
section
908(c)(13),
a
scheduled
award
for
hearing
loss,
and
following
aduddell,
the
board
held
that
the
worker
was
not
entitled
to
the
award
because
of
his
status
as
a
retiree
at
the
time
the
hearing
loss
became
manifest.
against
this
background,
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1984
in
part
dealing
with
the
problem
of
occupational
disease
claims
by
retirees,
and
our
position
is
that
those
amendments
were
intended
to
apply
to
hearing
loss
claims
just
as
to
other
occupational
disease
claims.
a
starting
point
for
analyzing
the
statute...
that
is,
the
amendments...
is
section
910(i),
which
i'll
refer
shorthand
as
section
10(i).
that
section
provides
essentially
that
in
occupational
disease
claims
the
time
of
injury
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
average
weekly
wage
is
the
time
when
the
occupational
disease
becomes
manifest
to
the
worker,
when
he
becomes
aware
of
it,
or
should
have
become
aware
of
it.
that
is
the
disability.
that
is,
when
the
worker
becomes
aware
of
the
disability.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
think
it
depends
on
which
hearing
loss
you're
referring
to.
the
hearing
loss
of
84
percent
didn't
occur
until
1983.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
it
occurred...
whether
it
was
present
at
the
time
he
retired,
and
that's
because
of
the
effect
of
aging,
so
that
the
disability
that
became
manifest
to
the
worker
in
1983
and
for
which
he
was
entitled
to
claim
in
all
likelihood
didn't
occur
at
the
time
he
retired.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
some
of
it--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--yes.
the
director
has
attempted
to
make--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--that
distinction,
that
hearing
loss
due
to
excessive
noise
in
an
occupational
setting
occurs
shortly
after
the
injurious
stimulus
occurs.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
no.
i
agree
with
that
basic
premise--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--that
basic
theory,
but
i
just
feel
it
doesn't
go
far
enough
because
it
doesn't
concentrate
on
the
disease
that
becomes...
or
the
disability
that
becomes
manifest
later
to
the
worker.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
the
hearing
loss
wasn't
manifest
during
the
period
of
employment,
the
hearing
loss
wasn't
manifest--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--we're
dealing
with
the
issue
of
whether--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--that's
not
the
issue.
in
fact,
we
would
concede
that
he
is
entitled
to
that,
because
there
was
no
offset
under
this
statute
for
the
effects
of
aging.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--and
the
question
is,
under
which
provision
of
the
law--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--i
guess
i
may
be
misleading
in
that
way.
what
i
mean
to
say
is,
he's
entitled
to
an
award
based
upon
that
audiogram
in
1983.
the
question
is
whether
the
compensation
should
have
been
under
section
908(c)(13)
or
under
section
908(c)(23).
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
guess
i
would
change
that
a
little
to
say
that
it
depends
on
whether
the
disability
that
became
manifest
to
the
worker
became
manifest
before
or
after
the
retirement.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
think
that
the
provision
under
which
he's
compensated
does
depend
on
when
the
hearing
becomes
manifest
in
terms
of
when
it's
measured.
a
worker--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--i
think
that
the
time
when
the
injury
occurred,
what
we're
referring
to
is
the
time
of
injury
under
section
910(i),
and
i
think
that
depends
on
when
the
worker
knows
or
should
have
known--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--of
a
disability.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
and
my
point
would
be
that
in
the
case
of
hearing
loss,
a
worker
cannot
know
of
a
disability,
which
is
an
impairment
measured
by
a
hearing
test,
until
the
hearing
test
is
taken.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
think
that
the
question
is
what
disability
is
congress
referring
to
when
they
refer
to,
does
not
immediately
result
in
death
or
disability,
and
our
position
is
that
the
disability
that's
important
is
the
disability
that
becomes
manifest
in
the
disability
which
the
worker
can
claim.
it's
true
that
the
occupational
component
of
the
hearing
loss
results
immediately
or
virtually
immediately.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
but
i
think
that
the
first
and
the
third
references
to
disability
in
the
statute
refer
to
something
else,
and
that
the
disability
should
be
read
consistently.
that
is,
each
reference
to
disability
should
be
read
consistently.
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--well--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--because
the
distinction
between
an
injury
and
an
occupational
disease
is
that
an
injury
happens
because
of
a
sudden
event,
where
an
occupational
disease
occurs
over
a
long
period
of
time,
evolves
over
a
period
of
time,
and
occurs
not
because
of
an
accident
or
a
sudden
event,
but
because
of
the
characteristics
of
the
particular
industry.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
yes.
there
can
be
cases
where
a
sudden
event
can
cause
hearing
loss,
such
as
an
explosion.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
right.
the
statute
describes
an
occupational
disease
as
arises
naturally
out
of
such
employment.
in
the
case
of,
for
example,
a
shipyard,
the
disease
naturally
results
from
the
condition
of
employment,
and
we've
cited
in
the
briefs--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
when
you
say
this
statute,
you
refer--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--i
think
it's
been
held
repeatedly
that
hearing
loss
is
an
occupational
disease
by
the
various
circuit
courts.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
correct.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
think
it's
the
only
plausible
one,
yes.
moving
from
section
910(i),
in
the
case
where
the
time
of
injury
is
after
retirement,
section
910(d)(2)
determines
the
average
weekly
wage,
depending
on
whether
it
is
within
a
year
or
after
a
year
of
retirement.
in
cases
in
which
section
910(d)(2)
applies,
section
908(c)(23),
enacted
in
1984,
creates
a
new
type
of
benefit
for
retirees
who
claim
occupational
disease,
and
that
section
must
apply
if
section
910(d)(2)
applies.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
because
it
is
the
date
of
manifestation...
that
is,
the
date
when
the
worker
knows
he
has
a
disability.
that
is
the
time
of
injury
for
several
purposes.
the
legislative
history
makes
reference
after
reference
to
its
concerns
with
the
date
of
manifestation
as
being
the
time
of
injury
rather
than
the
date
of
last
exposure.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
but
without
10(i),
the
time
of
injury
for
average
weekly
wage
purposes
would
be
the
date
of
last
exposure,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
that
result
at
all.
congress
wanted
the
time
of
injury
to
be
the
date
of
manifestation,
at
which
time
we
determine
the
worker's
wage,
at
which
time
his
time
for
filing
begins
to
run,
and
in
the
case
where
the
time
is
after
retirement,
there
are
special
provisions.
we
have
to
remember
that
before
the
enactment
of
these
provisions
under
redick
and
aduddell,
the
worker
whose
time
of
injury
was
after
retirement
would
have
been
denied
benefits
all
together.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
10(i)
doesn't
deal
with
retirement
at
all.
10(i)
deals
with
the
case...
this
simply
establishes
that
the
time
of
injury
is
as
of
the
date
of
manifestation.
10(d)(2)
deals
with
retirement.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
in
the
case
of
any
occupational
disease,
the
disability
can
occur
while
the
worker
is
still
working.
you
can
develop
asbestosis
while
you're
still
working.
well,
you're
still
under
10(i).
your
time
of
injury
is
simply
the
date
of
manifestation.
if
that
then
happens
to
be
after--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--retirement,
you're
in
10(d)(2).
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
again,
we
have
to
refine
that
to
mean...
to
determine
whether
we're
talking
about
a
disability
that
the
worker
can
claim,
and
the
disability
that
later
becomes
manifest
on
the
one
hand,
or
just
the
occupational
component
of
the
disease,
which
may
not
be
manifest
to
the
worker.
i
think
the
real
question
is
did
congress
intend
to
make
this
distinction
between
long
latency
diseases
and
other
types
of
occupational
diseases.
although
it
is
an
interesting
distinction
to
draw,
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
was
even
aware
of
the
distinction
or
intended
to
make
the
distinction
in
excluding
hearing
loss
from
910(i).
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
aware
of
redick--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--the--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--caused
by
the
employment,
but
not
the
compensable
hearing
loss
which
you
made
reference
to.
the
compensable
hearing
loss
is
the
entire
hearing
loss,
which
may
have
an
aging
component
as
well.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
yes.
yes,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
distinction
is
important.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
that
would
be
compensable,
yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
agree
with
that.
as
i
mentioned,
the
court...
the
congress
was
aware
of
redick
and
had
to
do...
and
wanted
to
do
something
about
it,
and
if
section
910(i)
does
not
apply
to
hearing
loss
claims,
then
there's
nothing
else
in
the
statute
that
would
change
the
result
of
redick.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
don't
believe
so,
because
redick...
the
claimant
in
redick
was
not
denied
benefits
because
he
had
filed
his
claim
late
under
section
913
or
because
he
gave
notice
late
under
section
912.
mr.
redick
was
denied
benefits
simply
because
he
was
a
retiree,
so--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--it's
not
clear
whether
mr.
redick
would
or
would
not
have
had
a
problem
with
notice
in
the
statute
of
limitations
if
he
would
had
gotten
over
the
retiree
provisions.
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
in
redick
that
tells
us
that.
it's
very
arguable
that
if
he
had
given
notice
and
had
filed
his
claim
very
quickly
after
he
got
his
audiogram
after
he
retired,
he
would
have
been
all
right
under
those
provisions.
i
don't
think
we
know
that,
and
so
that
change
doesn't
necessarily
do
anything
about
redick.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
his--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--condition
arose
before
retirement.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
guess
the
question
that
you're
asking
is,
was
redick
wrongly
decided?
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
it
very
well
may
have
been,
and
i
think
the
important
point
is
not
whether
it
was
or
it
was
not,
or
whether
it
was
fair
or
unfair,
but
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
intend
to
do
in
light
of
aduddell
and
redick?
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
and
the
real
question
is
whether
congress
thought
that
hearing
loss
was
different...
not
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't,
but
what
congress
intended.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
think
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--i
think
the
congressional
intent
has
to
be
followed
unless
there's
some
constitutional
problem
with
it.
i
think
it--
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
--well,
what
we're
trying
to
determine
is
what
congress
intended
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
draw
a
distinction
between
hearing
loss
and
other
occupational
diseases
along
the
lines
that
the
director
suggested,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
first
congress
intended
to
do
something
about
redick.
secondly,
congress
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history
mentions
the
problem
that
the
disability
from
occupational
diseases
do
not
become
manifest
until
oftentimes
long
after
the
injurious
exposure
occurs.
hearing
loss
is
that
type
of
disease.
it
doesn't
become
manifest
until
the
worker
happens
to
have
his
hearing
tested,
and
that
could
be
either
before
or
after
retirement.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
well,
you
may
feel
subjectively
that
you've
lost
your
hearing,
but
you
may
not
have
what
a
hearing
test
would
show
is
an
ama
percentage
of
hearing
impairment.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
in
the
case
of
hearing
loss,
i
would.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
agree
with
that,
but...
and
you
would
know
your
disability
if
you
couldn't
work,
but
here
we're
dealing
with
injuries
as
opposed
to
an
occupational
disease
that
evolves
over
time,
and
again
i
think
that
the
date
of
manifestation
and
hearing
loss
is
when
the
hearing
is
tested
and
an
ama
disability
can
be
determined.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
the
occupational
component
of
it
doesn't.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
that
can
continue
after,
for
example,
a
retirement.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
particularly
aging.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
agree
with
that
statement,
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time
i
would
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
kevin
m.
gillis
i
wanted
to
cover
the
reasons
why
in
my
view
the
director's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
implausible.
first,
as
mentioned
earlier,
the
director
draws
a
distinction
and
tries
to
make
that
distinction
important
to
the
intent
of
congress
where
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
the
distinction
to
be
important.
there's
no
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
hearing
loss
is
somehow
different
than
asbestosis.
congress
was
concerned
with
the
latency...
or,
with
the
delay
in
time
between
exposure
and
manifestation,
and
hearing
loss
has
that
same
delay.
secondly,
if
congress
had
intended
after
the
'84
amendments
for
all
hearing
loss
claims
for
retirees
and
nonretirees
to
be
treated
under
section
8(c)(13),
there
would
have
been
language
in
8(c)(13)
to
say
that.
8(c)(13)
says
nothing
about
retirement.
third,
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
hearing
loss
claims
from
applicability
from
section
8(c)(23),
the
language
of
8(c)(23)
would
be
much
different.
the
introductory
phrase
in
section
8(c)(23)
is,
notwithstanding
paragraphs
(1)
through
(22).
obviously,
(1)
through
(22)
includes
(13).
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
hearing
loss
claims
from
subsection
(23),
different
language
such
as,
notwithstanding
paragraphs
(1)
through
(12)
and
then
(14)
through
(22)
could
have
been
used.
instead,
the
opposite
language
is
used.
that
is,
section
8(c)(13)
is
included
in
the
language
of
8(c)(23).
finally,
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
director's
argument...
that
is
that
section
910(i)
is
inapplicable
to
hearing
loss
claims...
would
take
us
back
to
the
principle
that
the
average
weekly
wage
is
determined
at
the
time
of
last
exposure,
and
that
is
clearly
not
the
intent
of
congress
and
was
mentioned
several
times
by
congress.
i
also
wanted
to
comment
on
the
question
of
the
hybrid
approach
at
one
time
used
by
the
benefits
review
board.
our
position
on
that
is
there
is
simply
no
basis
in
logic
in
terms
of
interpreting
the
statute
to
arrive
at
that
approach.
if
section
910(i)
is
applicable,
then
section
910(d)(2)
can
be
applicable.
if
section
910(d)(2)
is
applicable,
section
8(c)(23)
has
to
be
applicable.
there's
just
no
way
around
it,
and
that's
why
that
approach
has
been
discredited
at
this
point
and
there
is
no
authority
for
that
approach.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
waiver,
i
wanted
to
briefly
discuss
that.
justices
stevens
and
scalia
touched
on
that.
the
waiver
was
with
respect
to
the
calculation
of
the
average
weekly
wage.
that
was
mentioned
in
dicta
by
the
first
circuit.
we
have
not
waived
the
issue
of
whether
section
8(c)(23)
applies.
the
waiver
was
very
limited.
we're
not
trying
to
have
the
average
weekly
wage
recalculated
or
recoup
any
benefits
based
on
that.
it
was
a
very
limited
waiver,
not
a
waiver
of
the
entire
argument.
