justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
director
doesn't
claim
otherwise,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way,
your
position
is
at
odds
with
the
director's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
the
only
permissible
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
in
subdivision
13
dealing
with
hearing
that
it's
a
permanent
partial
disability,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a
disability,
even
though
it
doesn't
result
in
any
proved
loss
of
earnings.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
don't
have
to
prove
it
to
get
this
compensation
under
13.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it's
just
because
it's
presumed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
it's
presumed
or
not,
if
you
get
a
toe
cut
off,
whether
you
just
go
right
on
doing
your
job
and
everybody
agrees
that
you're
just
as
good
as
you
ever
were,
you're
earning
just
as
much
and
you
get
salary
increases
or
wage
increases,
you
just
don't
have
to
prove
that
there's
any
loss--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
there
being
any
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
too
bad
an
idea
to
give
somebody
some
money
for
getting
a
toe
cut
off--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
saying
you've
lost
some
hearing
on
the
job,
we're
going
to
pay
you
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
day
before
he
retired
he
had
an
audiogram
and
said
i've
lost
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
only
going
to
get
what
13
says
he
gets.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
day
after
he
retires--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
why
should
it
be
different
the
day
after
he
retires
than
the
day
he
retires?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't.
you
want
to
use
this
scheme
that
the
benefits
review
board
was
using.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
loss
of
earnings
is
assumed.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
it's
a
disability.
justice
byron
r.
white
--section...
subsection
(c)
describes...
is
dealing
with
what
itself
calls
permanent
partial
disability.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
they're
all
disabilities.
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever,
but
i
would
think
(c)
at
least
says
that
all
of
these
listed
items
are
disabilities.
