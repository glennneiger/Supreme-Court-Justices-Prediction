mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
agrees
with
the
position
adopted
by
the
first
circuit
in
this
case,
and
it
said
that
subsection
13,
the
provision
in
the
schedule
that
specifically
applies
to
hearing
loss
cases,
is
the
provision
that
should
apply
here,
and
we
agree,
justice
white,
the
result
of
that
is
that
the
hearing
loss
award,
whether
or
not
the
claim
is
filed
while
you're
working
or
after
you're
working,
would
be
the
same.
the
employer
in
this
case
argues
that
subsection
23
should
apply
instead
of
the
hearing
loss
provision
and
the
employee
should
get
less
if
he's
retired.
the
employee
in
this
case
has
endorsed
the
scheme
that
the
benefits
review
board
came
up
with
and
has
since
abandoned,
under
which
the
employee
would
actually
get
more
if
the
claim
was
filed
after
the
employee
retired.
the
benefits
review
board's
hybrid
approach
combines
certain
favorable
aspects
of
subsection
23
and
certain
favorable
aspects
of
subsection
13
to
maximize
the
award.
in
his
opinion
for
the
first
circuit,
chief
judge
briar
put
his
finger
on
the
key
statutory
provision
and
the
key
fact
in
this
case.
the
key
statutory
provision
is
section
10(i).
that's
the
provision
that
says
that
the
rules
that
bath
iron
works
seeks
to
apply
are
applicable
only
to
disabilities,
quote,
due
to
an
occupational
disease
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
disability,
unquote.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
have
not
challenged
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
should
admit
that
the
medical
treatise
on
which
we
rely
refers
to
occupational
hearing
loss
as
a
disease.
you
are
correct
in
saying
that
the
way
it
occurs
it
frankly
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
an
injury.
the
way
occupational
hearing
loss
occurs
is
that
the
sound
waves
generated
by
a
loud
noise
batter
the
nerve
endings
in
the
inner
ear
and
immediately
cause
them
to
become
inflamed,
which
leads
to
an
immediate
loss
of
hearing.
it's
an
assault
which
in
many
other
cases
would
of
course
be
considered
an
injury,
but
we
have
not
argued
about
the
word
disease
here,
we've
instead
focused
on
occupational
disease
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
disability.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
our
answer
to
that
is,
this
court
noted
in
pepco
and
has
long
been
the
rule,
and
i
do
not
believe
is
challenged
by
any
party
to
this
case,
is
that
scheduled
injuries
automatically
call
for
recovery.
that's
always
been
the
rule.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
loss
of
earning
is
presumed.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they're
talking
about
a
loss
of
hearing
which
occurs
immediately.
it
would
be
nicer
if
there
were
something
in
the
statute
that
said,
by
the
way,
everyone
has
always
been
correct
that
scheduled
injuries--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--are
presumptive
of
disability.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
says
that
hearing
loss
is
permanent
partial
disability.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
agree
that
that's
right.
if
you
just
looked
at
the
definition
of
disability
in
section
2(10),
it
doesn't
make
that
as
clear
as
it
might,
but
no
one
challenges
that
as
long--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
you've
suffered
a
loss
of
hearing,
you've
suffered
a
disability
whether
or
not
your
earning
capacity
has
gone
down.
we
agree,
and
everyone
else
does.
so
the
key
provision
in
section
10(i),
the
key
fact
in
this
case,
is
that
occupational
hearing
loss
does
not
have
a
latency
period.
to
the
contrary,
as
should
be
clear
by
now,
occupational
hearing
loss
occurs
simultaneously
with
exposure
to
excessive
noise,
and
it
does
not
get
worse
after
the
noise
goes
away.
bath
iron
works
concedes
that
this
is
so,
said
so
here
today,
at
page
8
of
its
brief
it
states,
quote,
it
is
true
that
occupational
loss
of
hearing
is
immediate
because
it
does
not
progress
following
exposure
to
noise,
unquote.
that
is
correct.
we
agree
with
that.
when
you
put
section
10(i),
due
to
an
occupational
disease
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
disability,
together
with
that
fact,
that
occupational
hearing
loss
occurs
immediately,
then
it
is
evident
that
subsection
23,
the
special
retiree
rules
that
congress
adopted
in
1984,
do
not
apply.
what
applies
instead
is
the
schedule,
subsection
13,
which
specifically
covers
hearing
loss.
it's
a
rather
unsurprising
conclusion,
frankly,
that
the
hearing
loss
provision
should
apply
in
this
hearing
loss
case.
occupational
hearing
loss
is
different
than
asbestos-related
diseases,
and
perhaps
it's
helpful
to
consider
that
in
understanding
subsection
23.
asbestos
fibers
actually
remain
in
the
lungs
and
10
or
20
years
after
the
exposure
to
asbestos
is
removed,
they
may
then
develop
into
cancerous
growths
of
mesothelioma,
or
they
may
then
destroy
enough
of
the
lung
that
a
worker
has
asbestosis,
but
the
asbestos
fibers
stay
in
the
lungs
and
continue
to
do
damage.
when
the
worker
is
removed
from
the
exposure
to
excessive
noise
on
the
job
he
suffers
no
further
loss
from
that
exposure.
in
its
opening
brief
at
page
16,
bath
iron
works
recognized
that
this
court
could
decide
the
case
by
looking
no
farther
than
the
words
of
section
10(i),
but
advised
the
court
not
to
adhere
closely
to
what
congress
has
written.
it
instead
urges
the
court
to
treat
occupational
hearing
loss
like
asbestos-related
diseases,
because
senator
hatch
mentioned
redick,
the
benefits
review
board
decision
involving
hearing
loss,
along
with
two
asbestosis
cases
decided
by
the
board
and
said
that
they
represented
inequitable
policy.
as
chief
judge
briar
said,
and
again
we
agree
completely
with
his
opinion
for
the
first
circuit,
bath
seeks
to
prove
far
too
much
on
the
basis
of
far
too
little.
senator
hatch's
disparagement
of
redick
is
hardly
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
to
rewrite
the
statute.
in
any
event,
we
agree
that
redick
was
inequitable,
and
we
think
the
problems
with
that
decision
are...
have
been
solved
and
are
easy
to
solve.
first,
congress
adopted
in
1984
at
the
same
time
it
adopted
the
special
rules
in
subsection
23,
a
special
rule
in
hearing
loss
cases
which
is
in
subsection
13(d),
which
provides
that
the
time
to
file
a
claim
for
hearing
loss
doesn't
run
until
the
audiogram
report
has
been
received,
so
there's
no
danger
of
workers
losing
the
ability
to
bring
these
claims.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
our
view...
and
this
gets
a
little
complicated,
but
in
the
case
you
described
i
believe
the
entire
hearing
loss
would
probably
be
compensated.
if
the
employee
can
prove
an
occupational
hearing
loss,
and
of
course
there
has
to
be
an
occupational
hearing
loss--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--for
the
employer
to
be
liable,
and
it's
then
not
possible
to
separate
out
the
age-related
hearing
loss
from
the
occupational
hearing
loss,
then
an
award
for
the
entire
hearing
loss
is
what
is
normally
proper.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
if
an
employer
would
give
an
exit
audiogram
and
freeze
the
amount
of
occupational
hearing
loss,
that
we
don't...
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
director
that
the
employer
should
not
be
liable
for
any
subsequent
age-related
hearing
loss.
i
should
note
in
this
connection
that
osha
has
published
regulations
mandating
exit
audiograms
in
especially
noisy
injuries.
this
is
recent,
but
it
may
well
solve
some
of
these
important
problems
in
the
future.
as
i've
said,
i
think
section
10(i)
is
quite
clear
here.
let
me
just
state
that
if
there
were
any
question
about
that,
deference
would
be
appropriate.
in
1985,
1
year
after
the
relevant
amendments,
the
secretary
of
labor
promulgated
a
regulation
which
we've
reprinted
at
the
very
last
page
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
question
was
whether
hearing
loss
claims
should
be
treated
like
other
accidental
injuries
listed
in
the
schedule
or
whether
they
should
be
treated
like
asbestosis
in
terms
of
when
you
have
to
file
your
notice.
it's
30
days
in
the
case
of
accidental
injuries
and
a
year
in
the
case
of
asbestosis.
the
director
said
quite
clearly
30
days,
hearing
loss
is
like
an
accidental
injury.
but
this
isn't
really
a
deference
case.
while
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
complex.
as
chief
judge
briar
concluded,
when
you
come
right
down
to
it,
it
actually
says
something
fairly
simple:
when
an
employee
sustains
a
disability
after
retirement
as
the
result
of
a
latent
disease,
the
special
rules
in
subsection
23
apply.
in
a
hearing
loss
case,
where
the
injury
occurs
immediately,
subsection
13
applies.
thank
you.
