justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
how
10(i)
reads.
it
reads,
with
respect
to
a
claim
for
compensation
for
death
or
disability
due
to
an
occupational
disease
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
death
or
disability,
and
i
understand
it
to
be
conceded
that
the
hearing
loss
here
immediately
occurs
when
he's
working
and
his
ears
are
invaded
by
excessive
noise,
that
the
injury
immediately
results,
therefore
10(i)
is
inapplicable.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
all
the
section
talks
about...
disability
due
to
an
occupational
disease
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
death
or
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
me
again
why
you
say
that
the
time
of
injury
is
after
retirement?
i'm...
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
then
10(i)
becomes
circular.
10(i)
says
with
respect
to
a
disability
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
disability,
the
time...
in
death
or
disability,
an
occupational
disease,
a
disability
due
to
an
occupational
disease
which
does
not
immediately
result,
the
time
of
injury
shall
be
deemed
to
be
the
date...
shall
be
deemed
to
be
the
date
on
which
the
employee
or
claimant
becomes
aware.
i
mean,
that's
why
you
need
that
section.
you
wouldn't
need
that
section
if
the
natural
order
of
things
is
that
the
time
that
an
injury
occurs
is
the
time
that
you
become
aware
of
it.
it's
only
10(i)
that
produces
that
result
for
certain
types
of
injuries.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
put
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
10(i)
applies
here
because
this
is
an
injury
that
occurred
after
retirement,
and
then
i
ask
you
why
this
is
an
injury
that
recurs
after
retirement,
and
you
say,
because
10(i)
says
that
it
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
injury
that
recurs
after
retirement,
but
you
don't
get
into
10(i)
to
begin
with
unless
it
is
an
injury
that
occurs
after
retirement,
so
you
can't
appeal
to
10(i)
as
the
justification
for
your
assertion
that
this
injury
occurred
after
retirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it...
10(i)
deals
with
retirement
inasmuch
as
you
only
qualify
for
10(i)
if
the
injury
does
not
occur
immediately...
that
is,
while
you're
still
working,
okay...
and
i
ask
you
why
this
injury
didn't
occur
immediately,
and
you
say,
well,
because
10(i)
says
it
shall
be
deemed
not
to
have
occurred
until
you
find
out
about
it,
but
you
don't
get
into
10(i)
unless
it
did
not
occur
immediately.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
because
asbestosis
is
not
a
disease
which
immediately
results
in
disability,
but
i
thought
that
it
had
been
conceded
here
that
the
hearing
disability
occurs
immediately.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
that
the
case?
i
mean,
if...
you
know,
if
congress
says
in
a
statute
that
x
is
true,
or
x
will
be
the
result
whenever
y
is
true,
thinking
that
y
is
true
in
some
situations
where
in
fact
it
isn't
true,
we
rewrite
the
statute
to
say
that
x
is
the
result
even
where
y
is
not
true
because
congress
thought
that
y
was
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it's
contrary
to
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that's
quite
different
what
you
said...
i
thought
you
were
saying
even
if
congress
put
it
incorrectly
we're
bound
to
follow...
to
do
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
even
if
it
ended
up
doing
something
else.
you
don't
support
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gillis,
can
i
follow
up
on
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
you?
you
acknowledged
in
response
to
her
question
that
the
hearing
loss
occurs
immediately
at
the
time
of
employment
when
the...
and
is
it
not
also
true,
or
is
it
conceded
that
it
does
not
get
any
worse?
if
you
lost
15
percent,
you've
lost
15
percent,
and
it
stays
15
percent.
now,
you
may
only
notice
it
later,
but
it
doesn't
progressively
increase.
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
which
is
to
say
you
may
have
hearing
loss
from
some
other
causes
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
--somebody
else
can
shoot
a
gun
in
your
ear
or
something
like
that,
and
you'd
lose
your
hearing,
but
the
effect
of
the
occupational
activities
that
caused
your
hearing
loss
does
not
increase
afterwards.
it
occurs
at
once,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
that
section,
under
13,
not
under
23.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand.
are
you
saying
it
doesn't
matter
how
we
come
out
in
this
case,
your
client's
going
to
come
out
with
just
as
much
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
you
here
for,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's...
yes.
now,
what
do
you
do
about
the
fact
that
the
definition
of
disability
seems
to
be
tied
to
loss
of
wages
and
so
long
as
the
person's
in
the
same
job,
he
has
not
immediately
suffered
any
loss
of
wages?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
definition
of
disability
really
is
not...
i
guess
it
isn't...
8(c)(13)
doesn't
seem
to
use
disability
in
the
definitional
sense
either,
because
it
says
in
the
case
of
disability
partial
in
character
but
permanent
in
quality.
now,
they're
not
talking
about
a
loss
of
wages
that
is
partial
in
character
but
permanent
in
quality.
they're
talking
about
an
injury
that
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
