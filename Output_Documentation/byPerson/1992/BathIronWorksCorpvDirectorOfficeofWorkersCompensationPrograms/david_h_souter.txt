justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we
have
no
question
before
us
here
as
to
the
extent
to
which
that
greater
disability
may
even
be
compensable.
the
only
issue
that
we
have
is
whether
the
hearing
loss
resulting
from
the
occupational
conditions
was
manifest
in
a
manner
in
which
it
could
or
should
have
been
perceived
during
the
period
of
employment,
and
that
is
conceded,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
fact
that
he
had
an
84
percent
hearing
loss
at
some
later
time
presumably
was
not
manifest
earlier,
but
that's
not
the
issue
that
we're
dealing
with.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
even
know
whether
he's
entitled
to
compensation
or
an
84
percent
hearing
loss.
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
concede
that
he
is
entitled
to
compensation
for
84
percent?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that's
a
generous
concession
for
you
to
make,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
whether
it
should
or
should
not
be
depends
upon
which
the
hearing
loss...
depends
upon
whether
the
hearing
loss
attributable
to
the
occupational
conditions...
the
injury
attributable
to
the
occupational
conditions
occurred
during
the
period
of
employment
and
whether
that
loss
was
manifest
or
should
have
been
manifest
during
the
period
of
employment.
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
the
standard.
the
standard
is
not
whether
it
was
manifest
to
him,
the
standard
is
whether
it
was
either
known
or
should
have
been
known,
and
i
presume
that
means
that
following
exposure
to
conditions
that
would
naturally
harm
his
hearing,
he
could
have
had
an
audiogram
and
discovered
his
disability
then.
he
loses
nothing
by
waiting,
because
we
have
the
savings
clause
now
that
the
period
for
application
is
not
lost,
but
the
fact
is
the
point
at
which
the
injury
is
measured
doesn't
depend
on
whether
he
perceived
the
loss
as
a
fact
or
not,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i...
excuse
me,
i'm
not
making
my
question
clear.
do
you
concede
that
whether
or
not...
excuse
me.
do
you
concede
that
the
point
at
which
the
injury
occurred
does
not
depend
merely
on
whether
he
perceived
it
but
on
whether
he
perceived
or
should
have
perceived
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
should
have
known.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
deny,
do
you,
that
if
following
the
date
of
his
first
exposure
to
noise
he
said
i
wonder
if
i
had
a
hearing
loss,
and
he
went
to...
what
is
it,
an
audiologist,
and
had
his
hearing
measured,
and
the
finding
was
that
he
had
suffered
a
5
percent
hearing
loss
and
he
could
show
that
that
was
attributable
to
the
noise,
you
don't
deny
that
that
would
have
been
compensable
right
then
and
there,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
there...
redick
is...
or
the
desire
to
respond
to
redick
is
satisfied
simply
by
extending
the
date
within
which
claim
may
be
made,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
without
an
extension
of
the
time
within
which
claim
would
have
been
made,
he
would
have
been
out
anyway,
wouldn't
he,
so
congress
could
have
said
this
will
satisfy
the
problem
of
allowing
redick...
allowing
redicks
of
this
world
to
come
in
and
make
their
claim,
and
because
we
assume
that
the
injury
is
complete
at
the
date
at
which
it
occurs,
there
will
be
no
problem
for
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
not
true
if
it's
a
scheduled...
if
it's
scheduled,
isn't
it?
