mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court:
unlike
mr.
gillis,
who
represents
bath
iron
works,
and
mr.
white
who
represents
the
director,
department
of
the...
a
portion
of
the
department
of
labor,
i
represent
a
single
individual,
mr.
ernest
brown.
my
main
point
in
being
here
today
is
to
argue
that
mr.
brown
should
be
allowed
to
keep
his
award.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
director
concedes
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
keep
the
award
which
was
given
to
him
by
the
administrative
law
judge
many
years
ago,
subsequently
affirmed
by
the
benefits
review
board.
the
court
below,
the
first
circuit,
found
on
the
final
page
of
its
opinion
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
brown's
benefit
should
be
recalculated
has
been
waived.
so
my
initial
point
would
be
that
the
matter
of
the
amount
to
which
mr.
brown
is
entitled
has
been
finally
determined...
it
is
not
questioned
before
this
court...
so
that
in
the
event
the
court
adopts
the
position
of
the
first
circuit,
or
adopts
the
position
which
was
formally
held
by
the
benefits
review
board,
mr.
brown
is
allowed
to
keep
the
benefits
which
he
has
already
been
awarded.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
that
is
correct,
you
will
get
a--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--you
will
get
a
very
different
answer.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
but
the
specific
issue
of
whether
the
case
should
be
sent
back
for
a
recalculation
of
this
individual's
award
has
been
held
to
have
been
waived
by
the
first
circuit.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
because--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--i'm
sorry.
because
the
specific
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
individual's
benefits
should
be
recalculated
in
this
particular
case
was
waived.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
if
the
court
accepts
that
argument...
the
waiver
argument.
if,
however,
the
court
adopts
the
schedule
adopted
by
the
first
circuit,
if
it
upholds
the
first
circuit,
benefits...
and
benefits
are
recalculated,
the
amount
to
which
my
client
is
entitled
will
be
approximately
one
half
of
what
he
has
already
received.
if
the
court
accepts
the
position
which
was
formerly
held
by
the
benefits
review
board,
it
will
effectively
reduce
the
amount
of
compensation
to
which
he's
entitled
by
about
one
third,
so
we
certainly
have
a
case
of
controversy
if
the
court
decides
that
these
benefits
should
be
recalculated.
on
the
issue
of
which
particular
system
congress
intended
to
use
in
this
matter,
let
me
first
address
the
position
taken
by
the
director.
the
director
says
that
the
retiree
amendments
which
congress
enacted
in
1984
simply
do
not
apply,
and
we
get
back
again,
as
the
court
did
earlier
in
mr.
gillis'
argument
to
section
10(i).
10(i)
applies
only
if
the
disease
does
not
immediately
result
in
disability.
the
director
argues
that
because
there
is
an
immediate
injury,
that
is,
when
the
worker
is
exposed
to
noise
he
has
an
immediate
injury,
section
10(i)
does
not
apply.
if
the
court
reviews
the
definition
of
disability
which
is
contained
in
the
statute...
and
remember,
10(i)
only
applies
if
the
disability
does
not
immediately
occur.
the
definition
of
disability
states
that
there
must
be
a
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
for
the
purposes
of
section
10(i),
which
doesn't
refer
to
scheduled
awards,
it
simply
says
in
the
case
of
an
injury
which
does
not
immediately
result
in
disability,
then
you
have
to
go
and
read
the
section
which
defines
disability,
section
210.
disability
is
defined
as
a
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity,
or,
for
retirees,
as
a
permanent
impairment
assessed
under
the
guides
of
the
american
medical
association.
under
no
theory,
or
under
no
facts
in
this
case,
did
mr.
brown's
hearing
loss
immediately
result
in
a
disability.
first,
he
continued
to
work
throughout
his
entire
working
life
and
retired
in
1972,
voluntarily
for
reasons
totally
unrelated
to
his
hearing
loss.
he
had
no
disability
in
that
sense.
secondly,
the
treatises
cited
by
the
director
show
that
hearing
loss
progresses
over
time.
there
is
an
initial
injury
which
continually
gets
worse.
it
doesn't
simply
happen,
as
if
someone
put
a
gun
next
to
your
ear
and
pulled
the
trigger.
this
type
of
occupational
noise-induced
hearing
loss
as
a
medical
proposition
takes
place
over
time.
the
record
reflects,
in
fact,
that
mr.
brown
had
a
40
percent
hearing
loss
in
1954.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
40
percent
hearing
loss
caused
any
impairment
to
his
wage-earning
capacity,
and
in
fact,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
he
continued
to
work
for
18
more
years.
under
the
guides
to
the
evaluation
of
permanent
impairment,
published
by
the
american
medical
association,
hearing
loss
again...
occupational
noise-induced
hearing
loss...
does
not
immediately
result
in
a
disability.
the
guides
to
the
evaluation
of
permanent
impairment
say
that
you
do
not
have
an
injury,
a
permanent
impairment,
until
the
hearing
loss
has
progressed
in
the
critical
frequencies
to
a
point
where
you
have
lost
an
average
of
25
decibels
of
your
hearing.
so
under
no...
not
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
nor
under
the
medical
opinions,
nor
under
the
phrasing
of
the
statute,
did
mr.
brown's
hearing
loss
immediately
result
in
an
injury.
the
case
does
fall
within
section
10(i).
the
question
then
is,
having
once
fallen
within
section
10(i),
you
then
fall
within
what
had
been
characterized
as
the
retiree
amendments
in
section
10(d)(2).
those
amendments
talk
about
whether...
at
what
point,
rather,
the
hearing
loss
or
the
disability
manifests
itself?
does
it
manifest
itself
within
1
year
of
retirement
or
after
1
year
of
retirement?
section
10
is
nothing
other
than
congress'
direction
as
to
which
wage
is
to
be
used.
once
all
the
other
decisions
in
the
case
have
been
made,
the
court
or
the
administrative
body
has
to
look
at
whether
or
not
notice
was
filed
in
time,
whether
or
not
the
claim
was
formally
filed
in
time,
whether
or
not
the
individual
has,
in
this
case
a
disability
caused
by
noise,
and
then,
after
making
all
those
findings,
it
simply
goes
to
section
10
and
says,
what
do
we
pay
this
individual?
what
date
do
we
use
to
calculate
his
average
weekly
wage?
that's
all
section
10
is.
i
would
advocate
in
this
particular
case
that
the
court
adopt
a
position
which
was
utilized
by
justice
o'connor
in
perini
north
river.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
looked
at
the
statute
prior
to,
there,
the
1972
amendments,
to
see
if
an
individual
was
covered.
it
reviewed
the
1972
amendments
and
made
a
decision
that
the
individual
in
that
case
would
have
been
covered
prior
to
the
1972
amendments.
justice
o'connor
then
analyzed
the
legislative
history
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
made
a
determination
that
congress
meant
to
expand
coverage
under
the
1972
amendments
and
included
that
claimant.
justice
stevens
dissented
in
that
case
saying
simply,
if
you
read
the
statute...
which
is
essentially
what
the
employer
in
this
case
says...
if
you
read
the
statute,
you
are
forced
to
come
to
the
position
advocated
by
the
employer.
justice
stevens
took
that
position
in
dissenting
in
perini
and
said,
if
you
read
the
statute
as
claimed,
this
man
is
not
covered.
however,
in
that
case,
the
court
did
review
the
law
prior
to
the
'72
amendments,
reviewed
the
legislative
history,
and
went
on
to
decide
the
individual
was
covered.
if
you
take
the
same
approach
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
mr.
brown
could
have
been
compensated
prior
to
the
1984
amendments
for
his
hearing
loss.
there
was
no
need
for
the
so-called
retiree
amendments
which
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
to
have
been
enacted
in
order
for
him
to
have
been
compensated.
you
will
also
see
that
hearing
loss
cases
had
historically
been
treated
differently
from
other
occupational
disease
cases
under
the
act.
hearing
loss
cases
are
the
only
scheduled
occupational
disease.
mr.
gillis
and
the
court
was
discussing
redick
earlier.
in
that
case,
the
court
decided,
since
mr.
redick
filed
his
claim
following
retirement,
at
which
point
he
was
not
working
and
therefore
suffered
no
wage
loss,
he
could
not
then
be
compensated
because
he
had
no
wage
loss.
he
had
no
loss
of
earning
capacity.
the
retiree
amendments
were
enacted
to
deal
with
that
sort
of
situation.
mr.
brown
could
have
been
compensated
prior
to
those
amendments
because
case
law
established
that
the
date
of
manifestation
was
his
date
of
injury
for
the
purposes
of
filing
notice,
for
the
purposes
of
filing
his
claim,
and
for
the
purpose
of
determining
his
average
weekly
wage.
it
also
established
in
mr.
justice
stevens'
opinion
in
potomac
electric,
written
in
1980,
that
hearing
loss
is
a
scheduled
award.
congress
has
presumed
that
the
individual
has
a
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity
simply
if
the
injury
is
a
hearing
loss.
if
you
look
at
that
decision
and
then
look
at
redick,
you
can
see
that
redick
is
plainly
wrong
because
the
benefits
review
board,
completely
ignoring
potomac
electric,
said
we
can't
compensate
this
gentleman
because
he
has
no
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity.
they
simply
didn't
review
the
law
and
see
that
was
not
part
of
the
case.
because
hearing
loss
claims
have
always
been
the
only
statute
under
the
schedule,
there
is
a
presumed
loss
of
earning
capacity.
a
review
of
the
1984
amendments,
which
consumed
4
years'
worth
of
hearings,
a
review
of
the
house
amendments
and
the
house
proposals,
and
the
review
of
the
conference
committee
to
see
what
ultimately
came
out,
will
show
that
hearing
loss
cases
have
been
treated
differently
than
other
occupational
disease
cases,
that
congress
had
no
need
to
be
concerned
with
hearing
loss
cases
specifically
because
they
could
have
been
compensated
without
the
'84
amendments,
that
congress
was
really
working
on
compensating
individuals
who
suffer
from
other
types
of
long
latency
occupational
diseases.
i
agree
for
the
most
part
with
the
position
taken
by
the
director.
the
key
difference
is,
i
advocate
the
hybrid
system
which
was
until
very
recently
utilized
by
the
benefits
review
board.
basically,
that
system
says
hearing
loss
claimants
who
file
after
retirement
are
lumped
in
with
other
retirees
for
many
purposes...
for
the
purpose
of
when
they
have
to
file
their
notice,
for
the
purpose
of
when
they
have
to
file
their
claim,
for
the
purpose
of
determining
their
average
weekly
wage.
however,
because
hearing
loss
has
historically
been
treated
differently,
when
you
come
to
calculate
their
benefits,
they
receive
benefits
under
section
8(c)(13),
which
is
a
nonretiree
provision
of
the
statute.
it
results
for
the
most
part
in
the
employee
receiving
what
he
would
have
received
had
he
filed
his
claim
prior
to
retirement.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
it
is,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
it
can,
obviously.
if
the
hearing
loss
progresses
to
a
point,
you
can
have,
but--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
it
is
presumed.
the
court
held
in
potomac
electric
that
it
is
presumed.
when
congress
set
forth
the
schedule,
sections
8(c)(1)
through
(20),
they
were
saying
that...
congress
said
if
you
have
an
injury
which
fits
into
this
schedule
you
do
not
have
to
demonstrate
you
actually
lost
earning
capacity
or
lost
wages.
that
is
presumed.
you
will
receive
the
amount
set
forth--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
the
statute
awards
you
benefits--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--for
that
loss.
it
makes
it
easier
for
you.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
i
agree,
and
that's
why
i
say--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--absolutely.
what
i
advocate
is
a
system
which
would
not
reduce
the
award
given
to
an
employee
who
files
his
claim
for
hearing
loss
after
retirement
to
meaningless
levels.
in
my
particular
case,
what
will
happen
is
the
difference
between--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--fine.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
under
either
of
the
other
two
theories
he
will
receive
less,
especially
under
the
theory
advocated
by
the
employer--
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
--because
he
will
receive
a
small
amount
of
money
weekly
for
the
balance
of
his
life
as
opposed
to
the
award
under
section
13.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
i
don't
believe
it
should,
your
honor,
and
that's
my
point.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
and
that's...
that
is...
if
i
can
use
your
term,
that
is
the
scheme
they
adopted.
the
scheme
they
adopted
was
to
put
him
back
into
section
13
so
he'd
be
compensated
as
though
he
had
filed
his
claim
before
he
retired.
mr.
ronald
w.
lupton
thank
you.
