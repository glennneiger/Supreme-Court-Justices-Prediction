justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question?
you
say
he
was...
in
the...
i
haven't
read
the
redick
case.
i
thought
i
understood
it
from
the
briefs.
but
you
say
he
was
denied
compensation
simply
because
he
was
a
retiree
and
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
now,
supposing
he
had
had
a
claim
for
a
loss
of
leg,
or
loss
on
one
of
the
other
scheduled
benefits
which
he
didn't
file
until
after
he
was
a
retiree.
would
he
have
lost
his
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
are
they
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
why
is
that...
why
is
the
hearing
loss
claim
different
if
it
arose
before
retirement,
if
he
in
fact...
you
know,
the
noise
around
the
place
caused
him
to
lose
some
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
i
think
redick
may
well
have
been
wrongly
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
they
did
at
least
take
care
of
the
cases
like
asbestosis,
or
however
you
pronounce
it,
where
the
injury
does
not
really
manifest
itself
until
2
or
3
years
later,
and
they
may
have
thought
hearing
loss
was
the
same,
but
maybe
they're
wrong
about
hearing
loss,
and
maybe
hearing
loss
does...
you
know,
is
an
injury
before
retirement
and
therefore
should
be
treated
like
a
loss
of
leg.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
sure.
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
understand
the
waiver
to
be
quite
as
broad
as
you
say.
i
think
what
they
said
was
that
if
you
use
the
calculation
based
on
sub-paragraph
13,
there's
no
change,
because
the
fact
that
it's
gone
from
whatever
it
might
have
been
at
the
date
of
retirement
to
82
percent
shouldn't
change
that
calculation,
because
we
don't
know
what
it
was
at
retirement,
but
they
are
arguing
that
if
you
use
section
23
you'll
get
a
different
answer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that's
not
waived.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that
right
at
that
point?
some
of
the
briefs
point
out
the
fact
that
as
a
person
ages
the
hearing
tends
to
decrease,
so
that
if
you
wait
5
or
10
years
for
your
audiogram
i
presume
you
get
a
higher
percentage
of
hearing
loss
than
if
it
had
been
taken
immediately
upon
retirement.
does
the
statute
contemplate,
in
your
view,
that
the
compensation
shall
be
measured
by
what
the
audiogram
shows
or
what
the
actual
hearing
loss
at
the
time
of
leaving
employment
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
over
the
proper
interpretation
of
certain
provisions
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
relating
to
claims
for
hearing
loss.
there
are
essentially
three
systems
for
compensating
partially
disabled
workers
under
the
statute
two
of
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
first
system
provides
for
compensation
for
claimants
who
have
separate
statutorily
scheduled
injuries
one
of
which
is
hearing
loss.
the
third
system
provides
for
compensation
for
retirees
who
suffer
from
latent
occupational
diseases
that
do
not
become
disabling
until
after
retirement.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
claimant
who
discovers
after
retirement
that
he
suffers
from
a
work
related
hearing
loss
should
be
compensated
under
the
first
system
because
loss
of
hearing
is
a
scheduled
injury
or
under
the
third
system
because
he
did
not
become
aware
of
the
disabling
condition
until
after
his
retirement.
in
the
decision
below
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
held
that
the
benefits
in
such
cases
should
be
calculated
under
first
system
while
on
similar
facts
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
and
eleventh
circuits
have
applied
the
provisions
of
the
third
system.
relying
primarily
on
the
plan
meeting
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
director's
undisputed
characterization
of
occupation
hearing
loss,
we
now
affirm.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
