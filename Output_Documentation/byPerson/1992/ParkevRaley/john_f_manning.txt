mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
explaining
what
we
think,
believe
is
the
proper
standard
for
evaluating
this
claim.
we
believe
that
it's
set
forth
in
this
court's
decision
in
chapman
v.
united
states.
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
is
eligible
and
the
court
may
impose
whatever
punishment
is
authorized
by
statute
for
the
offense,
so
long
as
that
penalty
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
and
so
long
as
the
penalty
is
not
based
on
some
arbitrary
distinction
that
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
this
case
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
definitively
interpreted
its
persistent
felony
offender
statute
to
turn
on
the
fact
of
conviction.
as
my
colleague
from
the
commonwealth
pointed
out,
that
is
clear
from
the
court's
decision
in
commonwealth
v.
gadd
at
page
917.
it
says
the
fact
of
conviction
is
what
the
statute
relies
on.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
arbitrary
for
the
state
to
treat
somebody
as
a
persistent
or
repeat
offender
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction.
we
believe
that
it
is
not
irrational
for
the
state
to
do
so
even
if
the
state
is
unwilling
to
allow
a
collateral
attack
in
which
the
defendant
may
raise
every
issue
that
he
could
have
raised
on
a
direct
appeal
of
the
prior
conviction.
mr.
john
f.
manning
it
does
have
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
kentucky
law
and
it
is
proven
to
the
jury.
but
this
court's
cases
have
for
many
years
made
clear
that
it
is
not,
it
is
not
dispositive
that
an
offense
is,
that,
i'm
sorry,
that
a
persistent
felony
offender
status
is
determined
by
a
jury
and
even
determined
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
graham
v.
west
virginia
the
court
said
even
though
it's
charged
separately,
even
though
it's
decided
by
a
jury,
a
persistent
felony
offense
is
a
sentencing
factor
that
enhances
the
punishment.
it
is
not
a
separate
offense
as
such.
and
even
if
it
were
the
question
would
be
the
same,
whether
it's
rational
for
the
state
to
treat
some
people
as
persistent
offenders
and
punish
them
more
harshly
on
the
ground
that
they
have
prior
convictions.
and
we
believe
that
it
is
rational
for
the
state
to
do
so
even
if,
as
i
mentioned,
there
is
not
a
full
right
to
appeal.
there
is
nothing
in
this
court's
cases
that
says
that
to
treat
somebody
as
a
persistent
felony
offender
they
have
to
be
retried
for
their
past
crimes.
mr.
john
f.
manning
it
depends
on
how
they...
i
mean
under
this
court's
cases
such
as
martin
v.
ohio
and
patterson
v.
new
york
the
answer
is
that
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
they
treat
them
as
offenses
as
such
or
as
sentencing
factors
under
state
laws.
they
are
free
to
define
the
offenses
in
a
manner
that
treats
the
prior
conviction
as
such,
the
fact
of
conviction
as
the
critical
element.
there
is
nothing
in
this
court's
cases
that
suggests
that
the
validity
in
general
of
a
prior
conviction
must
be
an
element
of
an
offense.
and
indeed
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
history
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
longstanding
tradition
was
that
states
would
traditionally
allow
people
charged
as
multiple
offenders
or
treated
and
sentenced
as
persistent
offenders
to
attack
their
prior
convictions
only
on
the
ground
that
the
prior
conviction
was
entered
by
a
court
without
jurisdiction
over
the
prior
offense,
and
that
is
evident
from
25
am
jur
at
page
266
to
267,
1940,
16
corpus
juris
at
1342,
1918,
kelly
v.
people--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--no,
your
honor.
the
rules
are
slightly
different
when
the
conviction
is
uncounseled,
and
that's
evident
from
this
court's
cases
in
tucker
and
burgett.
but
we
believe
that
the
reason
that
that's
so
is
the
right
to
counsel
is
on
a
different
plane
from
typical
errors
that
would
impact
a
conviction.
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times,
the
right
to
counsel
goes
to
the
very
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
we
would
suggest
that
the
kind
of
error
would
have
to
be
a
fundamental
structural
error
such
as
perhaps
the
adjudication
of
the
case
before
a
kangaroo
court
or
the
adjudication
of
the
case
before
a
biased
judge,
something
that
went
to
the
very
legitimacy
of
the
process
and
not
merely
cause
one
to
doubt
the
reliability
of
the
conviction,
but
the
very
legitimacy
of
the
proceeding
from
which
it
was
rendered.
and
that,
by
the
way,
brings
the
tucker
and
burgett
line
of
cases
into
line
with
the
traditional
basis
for
providing
relief
from
final
judgments
of
the
conviction,
i.e.
that
it
was
rendered
by
a
court
that
didn't
have
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
f.
manning
your
honor,
that...
your
question
essentially
is
the
same
as
asking
whether
a
defendant
can
raise
a
voluntariness
claim
in
general
in
the
context
of
a
collateral
attack
in
a
sentence
enhancement
proceeding,
and
our
answer
to
that
would
be
no.
we
think
that
the
question
is
whether
society
can
rationally
treat
a
final
conviction
as
conclusive
without
giving
the
defendant
an
opportunity
in
the
run
of
cases
to
raise
all
manner
of
trial
error
in
the
prior
conviction.
mr.
john
f.
manning
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
presence...
presumably
the
lawyer...
yes,
if
the
defendant
has
a
lawyer
then
the
courts--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
the
lawyer
presumably
will
get
an
interpreter,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
your
honor,
with
respect,
it's
always
possible
to
come
up
with
very--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
the
court--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--right
to
counsel
and
fundamental
structural
errors
that
would
be
equivalent,
and
we
frankly
think
there
are
very
few.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
whatever
the
class
of
errors
is,
boykin
is
far,
far
from
it.
it
is
a
prophylactic
error.
it
is
not...
to
say
that
a
court
has
violated
boykin
is
not
to
say
that
it
has
violated
the
constitution.
mr.
john
f.
manning
again,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
same
question
as
justice
stevens
asked,
which
is
whether
a
state
must
allow
the
defendant
to
raise
such
a
claim.
i
mean,
if
the
defendant
is...
certainly
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
state
could
allow
a
defendant
to
raise
such
a
claim,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
irrational
to
foreclose
a
defendant
from
raising
challenges
to
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea
in
the
run
of
cases
and
to
treat
a
prior
conviction
as
conclusive
of
the
fact
that
this
person
is
a
repeat
offender
and
deserves
harsher
punishment
than
somebody
who
has
not
previously
been
convicted.
the
due
process
inquiry
in
this
case
is
very,
very
close
to
an
equal
protection
question.
you
have
two
defendants,
both
of
whom
are
identical
in
every
respect
except
that
one
of
them
has
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime
before
and
one
of
them
has
a
record
that
has
two
prior
convictions
that
are
regular
on
their
face.
and
we
submit
that
under
this
court's
cases
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
rational
distinction
to
punish
the
second
defendant
who
has
two
convictions
more
heavily.
and
the
answer
is,
with
the
exception
of
fundamental
errors
in
the
prior
convictions
such
as
the
ones
that
were
identified
by
this
court's
cases
in
tucker
and
burgett,
it
is
entirely
rational
for
the
states
to
make
that
differentiation
and
entirely
constitutional
for
the
states
to
implement
their
persistent
felony
offender
statutes
on
that
basis.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
