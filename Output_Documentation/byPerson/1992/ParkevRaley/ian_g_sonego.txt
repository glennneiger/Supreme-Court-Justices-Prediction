mr.
ian
g.
sonego
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
ricky
raley's
1986
conviction
as
a
persistent
felony
offender
under
kentucky
law.
that
conviction
was
based
on
two
prior
guilty
plea
convictions.
on
the
1981
conviction
the
record
was
a
plea
negotiation
form.
raley
filed
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
those
two
prior
convictions.
at
the
suppression
hearing
raley
acknowledged
that
the
plea,
1981
plea
was
recommitted
by
counsel
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
offenses
to
which
he
pleaded.
the
sixth
circuit
ordered
a
new
hearing
regarding
that
plea
and
resulting
persistent
felony
offender
conviction.
the
attorney
general
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
respectfully
contends
that
because
a
challenge
to
a
prior
conviction
offered
for
purposes
of
sentencing
enhancement
is
a
collateral
attack
the
convicted
defendant
should
bear
the
burden
of
proof
to
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
prior
conviction.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
the
validity
of
a
prior
conviction
under
the
persistent
felony
offender
law
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
that
ruling
should
be
binding
on
the
federal
court
under
this
court's
opinion
in
martin
v.
ohio.
further,
the
ruling
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
is
fully
consistent
with
the
analysis
employed
by
this
court
in
lewis
v.
united
states
under
the
federal
convicted
felony
possession
of
firearm
law.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
must
be
by
a
pretrial
motion
and
it's
a
hearing
conducted
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
decided
by
the
judge
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
it's
also
clear,
of
course,
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
believes
it
is
compelled
to
do
so
under
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
allowing
such
a
challenge.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
no,
your
honor,
the
commonwealth
contends
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
was
viewing
itself
compelled
by
decisions
of
this
court.
we
have
cited
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
gadd
where
the
court
discusses
the
fact
that
the
prior,
the
validity
of
the
prior
conviction
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
itself
and
believes
itself
compelled
to
allow
a
pretrial
challenge
in
order
to
comport
with
due
process
rulings
by
this
court.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
well,
your
honor,
of
course
this
court
could
reverse
on
much
narrower
grounds.
your
honor,
the
commonwealth
would
be
happy
with
a
more
favorable
ruling,
but
this
court
could
reverse
on
more
narrower
grounds
simply
by
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
convicted
defendant
to
show--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
primary
issue
that
this
court
must
resolve
today
in
this
case
and--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--it
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
against
the
persistent
felony
offender.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
it
is
actually
a
double-header
collateral
attack,
if
you'll
pardon
my
use
of
that
analogy.
we
have
a
habeas
corpus
attack
on
the
persistent
felony
offender
conviction
which
in
turn
was
based
on
the
1981
conviction
subsumed
within
the
persistent
felony
offender
conviction.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
also
that
according
to
raley's
habeas
corpus
petition
filed
in
this
case
he
was
still
serving
time
on
the
1981
conviction
when
he
filed
that
habeas
petition.
so
clearly
he
was
not
attacking
the
1981
conviction
itself,
but
only
insofar
as
it
resulted
in
a
persistent
felony
offender
conviction.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
well,
your
honor,
i
would
be,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
that
there
should
only
be
one
collateral
attack,
but
clearly
you
are
correct
in
saying
that
this
collateral
attack
was
brought
because
of
the
persistent
felony
offender
conviction,
not
because
of
the
1981
conviction.
it
would
appear
since
mr.
raley
did
not
attack
the
1981
conviction
he
was
satisfied
with
the
result
in
that
situation.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
judgment
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--yes,
your
honor,
it
could
be
conclusive
evidence
if--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
could
provide
that
by
following
the
analogy
of
lewis
v.
united
states
in
taking
the
position
that
a
collateral
challenge
would
have
to
precede
the
subsequent
charge.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
challenge
should
be
brought
prior
to
the
subsequent
offender
charge
being
filed
has
been
discussed
by
some
of
the
federal
courts
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines,
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
few
states
that
have--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
should
make
a
difference.
kentucky
chooses
to
employ
jury
sentencing,
and
for
that
reason
requires
a
persistent
felony
offender
charge
be
included
in
the
indictment.
but
i
think
kentucky
could,
if
it
eliminated
jury
sentencing,
follow
something
analogous
to
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
i
interpret
the
cases
of
this
court
as
saying--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--your
honor,
i
would
have
to,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
precedents
of
this
court
establish
that
a
defendant
may
attack
an
uncounseled
guilty
plea.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
the
defendant
presumably
has
had
the
advice
of
counsel
and
therefore
certainly
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
with
counsel
the
events
leading
to
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
an
important
point
to
make
because
the
court
has
clearly
stated
the
right
to
counsel
is
fundamental.
it
has
been
applied
retroactively
to
the
criminal
cases.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
your
honor,
i
think
the
difference
is
the
court
has
assumed
that
where
counsel
is
not
provided
it
is
more
likely
an
innocent
man
would
plead
guilty
than
otherwise.
where
counsel
has
been
provided
then
counsel
has
the
opportunity
to
point
out
to
the
defendant
his
rights
and
possible
defenses
that
may
exist,
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
evidence
that
might
be
introduced
against
him,
and
the
possible
sentences
that
may
result.
the
commonwealth
respectfully
contends
that
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
convicted
defendant
making
a
collateral
attack
for
purposes
of
sentencing
enhancement
is
consistent
with
this
court's
ruling
in
medina
v.
california,
where
the
court
ruled
that
the
state
could
require
the
defendant
to
demonstrate
he
was
incompetent
to
stand
trial,
and
that
case
was
also
based
on
martin
v.
ohio.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
your
honor,
the
history
of
the
precedents
of
the
court
have
directed
that
the
denial
of
counsel
is
a
fundamental
right
permitting
a
collateral
attack
on
a
guilty
plea,
and
have
also
indicated
that
an
involuntary
guilty
plea
may
be
collaterally
attacked.
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
indicated
any
other
basis
for
a
collateral
attack.
the
court's
precedents,
such
as
united
states
v.
timmreck,
direct
attention
to
fundamental
defects
in
the
proceeding
that
would
make
the
resulting
conviction
fundamentally
unfair
and
potentially
or
probably
result
in
an
innocent
person
being
convicted.
and
certainly
probable
innocence
is
an
important
factor,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
in
evaluating
the
circumstances
of
a
collateral
attack.
the
history
of
the
precedents
of
this
court
clearly
indicate
that
on
a
collateral
attack
the
convicted
defendant
must
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
that
has
been
clear
at
least
since
johnson
v.
zerbst
in
1938
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
reiterated
that
the
burden
for
a
collateral
attack
should
fall
on
the
convicted
defendant
who
mounts
such
an
attack.
most
recently
in
hill
v.
lockhart
the
court
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
convicted
defendant
to
establish
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
was
consistent
with
the
court's
earlier
ruling
in
strickland
v.
washington
regarding
counsel
provided
for
a
trial.
the
court
has
also
made
it
clear
that
a
collateral
attack
is
not
a
substitute
for
an
appeal
and
therefore
a
higher
standard
must
be
applied
in
that
situation.
within
the
context
of
sentencing
enhancement
it
really
is
a
double
collateral
attack
that
is
being
mounted
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor,
that
could
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
prosecution,
bearing
in
mind
this
court
said
in
marshall
v.
lonberger
that
the
defendant
must
convince
the
trial
court
of
the
credibility
of
his
testimony,
or
whatever
witnesses.
but
i
certainly,
if
i
were
prosecuting
the
case,
would
want
to
present
whatever
evidence
i
had
at
that
point
and
not
take
a
chance
on
the
judge
deciding
the
defendant
was
a
credible
witness.
but
certainly,
as
this
court
has
indicated
most
recently
i
guess
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
marshall,
in
loper
v.
beto,
defendant's
own
testimony
certainly
opens
serious
credibility
questions.
and
i
think
again
the
lower
federal
courts
have
also
indicated
they
have
serious
doubts
about
the
ease
with
which
a
defendant
may
come
forward
and
claim
some
sort
of
constitutional
violation
without
any
corroboration.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
well,
your
honor,
he
certainly
could
present
other
witnesses
such
as
his
former
attorney,
the
former
judges,
bystanders,
kentucky
allows
a
bystander
bill.
a
bystander
can
be
able
to
observe
the
proceedings
since
they
normally
occur
in
the
courtroom.
things
of
that
nature.
a
court
clerk
may
have
been
present.
part
of
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that,
as
this
court
has
noted,
there's
no
time
limit
on
a
collateral
attack
and
a
collateral
attack
may
go
back
many
years.
likewise
kentucky
has
no
prescribed
time
limit
on
making
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
i
understand
the
normal
practice,
your
honor,
has
been
only
if
an
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
the
judge
could
order
it,
but
otherwise
it
wouldn't
be
made.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
commonwealth
is
arguing
under
johnson
v.
zerbst
it
should
be
the
burden
of
proof,
but
certainly
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
seemed
to
indicate
it's
simply
the
burden
of
producing
the
evidence.
apparently
kentucky
follows
the
slightly
lower
standard
at
this
point.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
the
matter
of
the
boykin
warning,
your
honor?
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
well,
your
honor,
the
commonwealth's
position
is
that
that
was
inherent
in
our
argument
that
dunn
v.
simmons
was
wrongly
decided
and
is
inherent
in
the
issue
of
which
side
must
bear
the
burden
of
proof,
because
the
question
becomes
how
is
that
burden
of
proof
to
be
satisfied.
cases
were
cited
such
as
hill
v.
lockhart
from
this
court
also
indicating
that
boykin
was
not
an
essential
component
of
a
valid
guilty
plea.
i
will
reserve
the--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--no,
your
honor,
that
was
not
a
precise
argument
caption.
we
presented--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--yes,
in
one
sense,
your
honor,
but
we're
contending
that
it
was
subsumed
within
the
other
arguments
presented,
the
argument
that
dunn
v.
simmons
was
wrongly
decided.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
we
contended
that
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
in
dunn
v.
simmons
was
in
error,
which
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
commonwealth.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
in
dunn
v.
simmons.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
and
by
asking
the
sixth
circuit
to
reexamine
that
ruling
we
contend
that
they
also
had
to
reexamine
whether
it
fared
around
a
boykin
warning.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
more
recently
in
the
mclaughlin
case
the
sixth
circuit
seems
to
have
indicated
a
boykin
warning
is
not
an
essential
component
of
a
guilty
plea.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
i
believe
the
chief
justice
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
directed
the
stenographers
to
try
to
save
their
notes
for
5
years,
but
there
is
no
further
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
your
honor,
i
believe
that
some
court
reporters
do
and
some
don't.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
yes,
your
honor,
that's
my
understanding.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
thank
you,
sir.
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
again
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
concluded
in
commonwealth
v.
gadd
that
the
validity
of
a
prior
conviction
is
not
an
element
that
the
commonwealth
must
prove
and
concluded
that
such
a
challenge
had
to
be
entertained
only
because
it
perceived
opinions
of
this
court
requiring
such
a
challenge.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
the
kentucky
supreme
court
case,
your
honor?
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
commonwealth
v.
gadd.
it's
cited--
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
cited
in
the
commonwealth's
brief
on
pages
21
and
22.
mr.
ian
g.
sonego
and
it
specifically
states
that
it's
the
fact
of
the
conviction
which
the
commonwealth
must
prove
for
purposes
of
a
persistent
felony
offender.
with
respect
to
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof,
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
that
standard
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
for
purposes
of
establishing
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
it
was
rejected
by
this
court
for
purposes
of
sentencing
in
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania,
and
certainly
appears
to
be
inconsistent
with
sumner
v.
mata.
finally
the
commonwealth
would
point
out
that
opinions
of
this
court
subsequent
to
boykin
have
never
identified
a
boykin
warning
as
a
fundamental
requirement
of
a
valid
guilty
plea,
north
carolina
v.
alford,
hill
v.
lockhart,
united
states
v.
broce.
if
there
are
no
questions.
thank
you.
