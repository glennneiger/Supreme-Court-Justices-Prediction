what's
the
relevant
historical
tradition
here,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
clare,
now
this,
the
defendant
after
this
1987
conviction
could
have
challenged
in
a
direct
appeal
any
claim
that
he
might
have
that
he
didn't
waive
his
constitutional
rights,
could
he
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
open
to
him
on
direct
appeal,
to
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
earlier
conviction
itself
when
it
was
handed
down.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
think
he...
as
i
recall
it
he
was
charged
most
recently
in
kentucky
as
a
persistent
offender.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
kentucky
relied
on
two
earlier
convictions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
on
both
earlier
convictions
is
it
not
true
that
the
defendant
could
have
challenged
on
direct
appeal
whatever
claim
he
had
at
that
time--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
he
didn't
understand
his
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he
didn't
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
you
say
that
now,
later,
when
he
is
charged
with
some
consequence
of
those
final
convictions
that
now
he
can
still
make
that
kind
of
a
challenge.
that's
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
position
is
that
now,
after
they
have
become
final,
that
he
can
nevertheless
reopen
the
validity
of
those
convictions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
kentucky
to
require
more
than
just
putting
into
evidence
those
convictions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
the
vast
majority
of
states
just
allow
proof
of
former
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
of
these
is
parke
against
raley,
no.
91-719,
and
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorary
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
1986,
ricky
harold
raley
was
charged
with
robbery
and
with
being
a
persistent
felony
offender
under
a
kentucky
statute
that
enhances
sentences
for
repeat
felons.
raley
moved
to
suppress
the
convictions
that
formed
the
basis
of
the
charge.
he
claimed
they
were
invalid
under
boykin
against
alabama
because
they
were
based
on
guilty
pleas
for
which
no
transcripts
existed.
and
so,
the
government
could
not
affirmatively
show
that
the
pleas
had
been
knowingly
and
voluntarily
entered.
at
the
suppression
hearing,
the
trial
court,
following
kentucky
law,
gave
up
presumption
of
regularity
to
the
final
judgments
of
conviction.
although
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
rested
with
kentucky.
raley
was
required
to
produce
some
evidence
of
the
invalidity
of
the
prior
convictions.
raley's
suppression
motion
was
denied
and
he
was
convicted
as
a
persistent
felony
offender,
and
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
it
found
that
raley
was
fully
advised
of
his
rights
in
1979,
and
inferred
that
he
remained
aware
of
them
in
1981.
raley
filed
at
federal
habeas
petition
challenging
the
kentucky
procedure
that
assigned
him
the
burden
of
production.
the
district
court
denied
relief
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
conditionally
granted
the
writ
with
respect
to
the
1981
plea.
it
held
that,
when
no
transcript
of
the
plea
colloqui
is
available
that
the
government
has
the
entire
burden
of
proving
the
prior
conviction
validity
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
for
reasons
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
kentucky's
burden
shifting
scheme
satisfies
due
process.
boykin's
holding
that
a
guilty
plea
is
presumptively
invalid
on
direct
review,
unless
the
record
affirmatively
shows
otherwise,
need
not
be
extended
to
collateral
proceedings
such
as
these.
kentucky's
procedure
is
not
fundamentally
unfair
in
its
operation,
and
neither
historical
nor
contemporary
practice
suggests
the
contrary.
our
precedents
permit
the
inference
that
raley
understood
his
rights
in
1981
as
they
had
been
explained
during
the
1979.
and
the
finding
that
the
1981
plea
was
knowingly
and
voluntarily
made
is
fairly
supported
by
the
record.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
