justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
state
say
that,
introduce
in
the
record
evidence
of
a
conviction
is
conclusive
proof
that
the
person
was
indeed
convicted
of
the
crime
for
purposes
of
the
persistent
felony
offender
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
not...
can
it
be
conclusive
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
state
provide
that
the
record
conviction
itself
suffices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
status
of
being
a
person
with
a
record
conviction
is
all
that's
needed
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
to
suffice
for
your
being
convicted
under
a
statute
like
the
pfo
statute
in
kentucky?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
same
answer
apply
if
there
is
a
separate
offense
for
being
a
pfo?
at
that
point
does
the
state
have
some
additional
burden
beyond
showing
record
evidence
of
the
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
all
parties
conceded
that
the
prior
conviction
was
obtained
through
an
unknowing
plea?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
an
uncounseled
plea,
there
is
no
counsel
present?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why?
what
is
the
difference
in
the
two
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
difference
depend
upon
the
fundamentality
or
the
gravity
of
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the
hypothesis
we're
assuming
that
the
guilty
plea
was
uninformed,
it
was
a
completely
uninformed
waiver.
why
is
that
any
different
from
a
case
where
there's
no
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
manning,
do
some
states
characterize
their
recidivous
statutes
as
being
separate
offenses
as
opposed
to
sentencing
enhancing,
and
if
they
do
are
they
then
required
to
prove
the
prior
offenses
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
is
your
answer
still
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
the
rule
the
same
if
the
conviction
is
uncounseled,
if
there
is
no
compliance
with
gideon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
a
plea
where
all
admit
that
the
plea
was
entered
unknowingly
and
without
knowledge
of
any
rights?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
in
one
sense,
under
your
theory
of
the
case
at
least,
you
would
still
have
an
argument
for
the
defendant
even
if
we
said
boykin
is
a
prophylactic
rule,
it
cannot
be
alleged
on
collateral
attacks,
stone
v.
powell
applies.
i
assume
under
your
theory
of
the
case
you
could
still
argue
that
the
conviction
was
improper
and
that
kentucky
has
therefore
not
made
its
case
in
the
1987
proceeding.
in
a
sense
you
don't...
boykin
certainly
helps
you,
but
it's
not
essential
for
you
to
make
this
defense,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
other
words
you
argue
in
a
case
that
comes
up
that's
like
this,
even
if
we
had
said
that
boykin
is
not
available
on
collateral
attack
you'd
say
well,
that's
irrelevant.
the
state
has
the
burden
to
show
that
the
conviction
was
properly
entered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
that
sense,
although
boykin
helps
you
it
is
not
essential
to
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
that
is
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
answer
the
arguments
made
by
kentucky
and
by
the
solicitor
general
and
indicated,
rephrased
by
justice
scalia,
that
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
here
is
being
convicted
of
a
third
offense
when
you
have
the
status
of
being
convicted
of
two
earlier
ones,
whether
or
not
those
convictions
were
valid.
