we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-719,
al
c.
parke
v.
ricky
harold
raley.
wait
till
i
tell
you
to
go
ahead,
if
you
will,
mr.
sonego.
okay,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
sonego,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
allows
a
defendant
to
make
some
sort
of
challenge
to
the
validity
of
a
prior
conviction
under
this
statute,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
think
it
was
just
interpreting
kentucky's,
the
kentucky
recidivous
statute
when
it
said
that
you
can
make
that
sort
of
challenge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
commonwealth
wants
something
more
favorable
to
it
from
this
court
than
they've
got
even
from
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
say
nothing
of
the
sixth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sonego.
mr.
manning,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
mr.
clare,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
what,
jefferson
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
think
a
boykin
violation
is
on
the
same
level
as
the
violation
of
the
failure
to
furnish
counsel
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
and
it
was
dicta
too.
to
say
that
something
was
void
is
dicta.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
a
plea
of
guilty
was
always
an
admission
to
all
the
elements
of
the
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
a
plea
is
involuntary
it
may
not,
it
is
not
a
knowing
confession
or
not
a
knowing
admission
of
all
the
elements
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
issue
is
really
whether
the
constitution
requires
kentucky
to
have
created
a
record
so
as
to
justify
a
challenge
to
a
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
prefer
to
use
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clare.
mr.
sonego,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
give
us
one
case
for
that
proposition,
mr.
sonego?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
g-a-d-d?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sonego.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
