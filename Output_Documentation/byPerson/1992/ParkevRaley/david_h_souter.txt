mr.
sonego,
when
you
concede
that
at
least
a
certain
quantity
of
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
state,
do
you
mean
that
it
would
be
enough
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
or
just
that
it
would
be
enough
to
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward
in
the
sense
that
if
there's
a
prima
facie
case
made
and
the
state
does
nothing
the
state
presumably
is
going
to
lose
if
the
judge
accepts
the
evidence
as
it
appears?
do
you
mean
then
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
or
just
the
burden
of
production?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
you're
saying
it
is
enough
simply
to
prove,
on
collateral
attack
now,
it
is
enough
simply
to
prove
that
he
didn't
get
the
warnings
from
the
judge
himself?
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
further
and
prove
that
his
plea
was
in
fact
unknowing
or
involuntary?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
boykin,
was
boykin
a
collateral
attack?
