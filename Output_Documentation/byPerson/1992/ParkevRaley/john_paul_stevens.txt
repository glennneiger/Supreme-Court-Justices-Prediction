justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
there
isn't
even
a
more
narrow
ground
than
that,
because
is
it
not
true
that
the
proceeding
that
we're
involved
in
is
a
collateral
attack
on
the
1987
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
procedure
followed
in
kentucky
satisfies
due
process
sufficiently
to
defeat
a
collateral
attack
on
the
1987
conviction,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact
i'm
not
sure
it
is
even
a
collateral
attack
on
the
'81
conviction.
it's
the
contention
that
in
the
'87
proceedings
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
use
the
1981
conviction.
they
wouldn't
have
to
set
aside
the
'81
conviction
in
order
to
say
that
was
fundamentally
unfair
one
way
or
the
other.
in
other
words
i
really
think
you
have
only
got
one
collateral
attack,
and
that's
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
nature
of
the
burden
you
think
the
petitioner
would
have?
suppose
he
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
says
the
judge
didn't
ask
me
any
questions
and
i
didn't
understand
what
the
crime
was
i
was
charged
with.
that's
all
he
says.
does
that
carry
his
burden?
does
it
shift
the
burden
to
the
state
to
go
forward
and
prove
otherwise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
what
if
the
only
other
documentary
evidence
is
that
there
was
no
transcript
prepared,
even
though
say
normally
they
do
prepare
a
transcript
but
in
his
case
they
didn't?
what
more
is
he
supposed
to
do
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
practice
in
kentucky
about
making
a
transcript
of
plea
hearings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
further,
just
a
practical
question?
as
i
understand,
you
don't
write
up
the
transcript
if
there's
no
appeal.
are
the
stenographer's
notes
either
preserved
on
tape
or
available
if
they
were
challenged
say
within
2
or
3
years?
i
can
understand
how
they
would
be
lost
if
you
had
to
wait
10,
15
years.
but
is
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
they
don't
regularly
make
sound
transcripts
of
these
hearings,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
up
to
the
court
reporter,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
say
as
a
matter
of
kentucky
law
the
fact
of
conviction
is
the
critical
thing.
is
that
an
element
of
the
offense
that
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
a
matter
of
kentucky
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
had
a
lawyer
but
did
not
speak
english
and
the
lawyer
didn't
speak
anything
but
english
and
the
judge
didn't
speak
anything
but
english.
would
that
be
sufficient
to
taint
the
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
if
the
lawyer
wasn't
there
he
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
the
presence
of
the
lawyer
would
make
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
defendant
can't
communicate
with
the
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
he
didn't
in
the
case.
they
were
busy,
you
know,
some
of
these
courtrooms
get
pretty
busy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
your
position
is
right
to
counsel
and
that's
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
don't,
or
no
jurisdiction.
