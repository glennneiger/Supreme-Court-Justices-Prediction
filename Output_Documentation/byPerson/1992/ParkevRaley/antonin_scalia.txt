justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sonego,
i,
my
understanding
is
that
you
did
not
raise
below
the
contention
that
the
entire
issue
could
not
be
raised
on
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
else
that's
on
that
plane?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
he
might
lie
about
that
just
as
he
would
lie
about
his
guilty
plea,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just
to
move
things
along,
as
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
painting
this
as
a
right
somehow
so
fundamental
that
it
requires
the
permission
of
collateral
attack
in
a
subsequent
proceeding,
and
i
fail
to
see
that
it's
that
fundamental.
i
mean,
i
am
sure
it's
very
useful.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
but
you're
telling
us
that
in
order
to
rush
things
along
defendants
are
willing
to
plead
guilty,
but
in
order
to
rush
things
along
they
would
not
be
willing
to
say
well,
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
for
the
boykin
sheet,
of
course,
yes,
i'll
say
whatever
you
need
said.
i
mean,
maybe,
but
i
don't
see
how
that's
so
fundamental
that
we
should
allow
it
to
be
attacked
collaterally.
justice
antonin
scalia
wherein
you
say
their
procedure
is
bad
is
that
it
does
not
permit
a
collateral
attack
on
the
earlier
conviction,
right?
isn't
that
wherein
you
say
their
procedure
was
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
who
cares?
i
mean,
you
say
the
presumption
is
in
his
favor.
that
assumes
that
it's
relevant
whether
he
waived
his
rights
or
not.
you
say
they
have
to
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
have
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
stands
convicted
of
these
prior
crimes.
the
element
of
the
offense
is
standing
convicted
of
these
prior
crimes
you
are
convicted
of
an
additional
crime.
they
have
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
indeed
he
was
convicted
of
those
prior
crimes.
your
argument
is
well,
he
was
wrongly
convicted
of
those
prior
crimes,
but
that's
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
offense
is
that
he
was
convicted
and
has
not
by
appeal
overturned
those
convictions.
it
seems
to
me
the
element
is
entirely
proven.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
doubt
whether
the
legislature
meant
the
all
prior
convictions
to
be
retried
every
time,
which
is
the
only
way
you
can
know
for
sure
that
it
was
a
valid
conviction,
is
to
retry
it.
it
seems
to
me
if
it's
there
on
the
books
and
he
hasn't
appealed,
it's
a
valid
conviction.
mr.
clare,
are
you
attacking
the
former
conviction
as
such
or
attacking
its
use
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
be
used
because
it's
invalid,
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
it
cannot
be
used
because
it's
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
time
to
show
that
it
was
invalid
was
the
time
it
was
received,
by
appealing
it
and
getting
it
set
aside.
let
me
put
it
another
way.
is
it
irrational
for
the
state,
you
think
it
is
irrational
for
the
state
to
say
that
a
person
who
has
been
lawfully
convicted,
has
failed
to
take
an
appeal
and
the
conviction
is
still
on
the
book,
deserves
to
be
punished
for
a
later
crime
as
a
repeat
offender
more
severely
than
someone
who
does
not
stand
in
that
situation?
is
that
an
irrational
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
wasn't
leaving
anything
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
would
have
no
problem
if
the,
you
know,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
decided
the
case
on
that
basis,
that
when
our
legislature
said
convict
it
meant
validly
convict.
they
are
free
to
say
that,
that
that's
what
their
legislature
meant.
but
i
had
thought,
in
fact
i
am
sure
that
this
case
comes
up
here
on
the
basis
that,
regardless
of
what
the
state
legislature
intended,
the
constitution
requires,
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
the
prior
conviction
have
been
a
valid
conviction
or
that
he
be
permitted
to
prove
that
it
wasn't
at
least
insofar
as
the
boykin
issue
is
concerned.
isn't
that
how
the
case
comes
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clare,
this
may
be
just
a
problem
of
terminology,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that
this
is
not
a
collateral
attack.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
collateral
attack
consists
of
anything
that
seeks
to
deprive
a
prior
judgment
of
its
normal
effect.
it
doesn't
have
to
dissolve
the
prior
judgment
entirely,
but
anything
that
seeks
to
deprive
it
of
what
would
be
its
normal
effect.
so
if
in
a
later
suit,
for
example,
you
seek
to
deny
res
judicata
effect
to
an
earlier
decision
that's
considered
a
collateral
attack
on
the
earlier
decision,
if
you
say
it
was
a
wrong
decision,
therefore
it
shouldn't
be
res
judicata.
that's
a
collateral
attack,
and
that's
what
you're
seeking
to
do
here.
you're
seeking
to
say
that
this
conviction,
which
would
normally
have
the
effect
of
rendering
you
liable
to
a
higher
penalty
the
next
time
you're
convicted,
in
this
case
should
not
have
that
effect
because
it
was
not
a
valid
judgment.
why
isn't
that
properly
called
a
collateral
attack
on
the
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that.
it
certainly
is
not,
you're
correct
that
it
is,
it
does
not
undo
the
whole,
every
aspect
of
the
prior
decision
the
way
a
habeas
proceeding
would.
but
the
point
i
make
to
you
is
that
a
collateral
attack
does
not
always
do
that.
there
are
many
other
sorts
of
collateral
attacks
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
one
sort
of
collateral
attack.
