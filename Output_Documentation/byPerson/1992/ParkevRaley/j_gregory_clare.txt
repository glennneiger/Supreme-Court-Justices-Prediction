mr.
j.
gregory
clare
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
extremely
important
case
because
it
deals
with
boykin
v.
alabama
and
the
rights
of
defendants
to
be
guaranteed
their
constitutional
rights.
every
morning
at
9
a.m.,
monday
through
friday,
in
louisville,
kentucky
in
the
hall
of
justice
the
first
floor
is
swarming
with
people.
there
are
eight
district
courts
that
line
the
left-hand
side
of
the
courthouse
and
outside
the
double
doors
of
each
of
those
courts
there
are
hundreds
of
defendants
waiting
their
turn.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that's
jefferson
county,
kentucky,
where
this
plea
was
taken.
these
defendants
are
charged
with
everything
from
speeding
tickets,
traffic
violations,
to
multiple
count
felony
complaints.
the
atmosphere
of
the
courthouse
resembles
a
bus
station
before
the
passengers
are
boarded
and
the
buses
are
about
to
depart.
the
defendants
wait
their
turn,
waiting
their
turn
come
from
all
walks
of
life.
most
of
them,
though,
are
undereducated
and
from
the
lower
socio-economic
background.
each
court
has
on
its
dockets
50
to
200
cases.
it
goes
from
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
11:30.
afternoon
court
starts
at
1
o'clock.
there
are
three
to
four
prosecutors
in
each
courtroom
conferencing
the
cases,
there's
the
judge,
a
couple
sheriffs,
and
a
clerk.
the
goal
of
everybody
is
to
get
the
cases
decided
and
to
move
on
to
the
next
one.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
they
have
an
hour
and
a
half.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
they
usually
get
an
hour
if
they
go
up
until
12
o'clock.
the
pace
in
the
courts
is
hectic.
the
prosecutors
and
the
judge
need
to
finish
their
docket
and
to
move
on.
because
of
this
there
is
a
strong
pressure
to
plead
guilty.
the
court
wants
to
clean
its
docket,
the
defense
counsel
wants
to
get
to
the
next
client,
and
the
prosecutor
wants
to
finish
his
job
for
that
morning.
the
only
time
that
the
constitution
comes
up
in
all
these
proceedings
is
when
the
boykin
sheet
comes
into
play.
the
boykin
sheet
sets
forth
the
constitutional
rights
the
defendants
have.
before
the
court
will
take
a
plea
it
wants
a
boykin
sheet
in
that
case
jacket
and
it
reviews
that
boykin
sheet
with
each
of
the
defendants.
the
defendant
signs
on
the
bottom,
the
defense
counsel
signs
on
the
bottom,
and
the
judge
signs
on
the
bottom
and
it
is
placed
in
the
record.
it
lists
the
constitutional
rights
and
the
defendant
states
in
open
court
on
the
record
that
he
has
read
the
boykin
sheet,
that
he
is
aware
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
when
he
is
pleading
he
knows
he
is
waiving
them.
this
is
video
recorded
in
some
of
the
courtrooms,
but
audio
recorded
in
all
of
the
courtrooms.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
a
defendant
may
lie--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--many
times
people
will
enter
into
a
plea
of
guilty
for
many
different
reasons,
but
the
important
point
here
is
that
on
the
record
he
has
acknowledged
that
he
is
giving
up
certain
rights.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
we
are
collaterally
attacking
the
1987
conviction,
which
is
an
attack
at
the
procedure
used
by
the
state
of
kentucky.
justice
stevens
stated
that
i
believe
you
only
get
one
collateral
attack
here.
the
collateral
attack
is
of
the
'87,
not
the
'81
and
the
'79
conviction.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that,
the
way...
yes.
that's
how
their
procedure
is
incorrect.
because
boykin
says
that
if
the
record
is
silent
as
to
the
waiver
of
these
constitutional
rights
then
it
is,
that
conviction
is
void.
what
the
sixth
circuit
done,
has
done
is
to
follow
the
line
of
the
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
cases,
saying
that
when
the
record
is
silent
you
get
a
hearing.
there's
a
presumption
against
the
waiver
of
those
constitutional
rights
that
are
inherent
in
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
as
far
as...
yes.
a
boykin
violation
is
meaning
that
the
defendant
has
not
been
advised
of
his
rights
on
the
record.
there
is
no
guarantee
that
he
is
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
therefore
that
conviction
is
void.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
boykin
v.
alabama.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
boykin
was
not
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
boykin
did
not
address
the
collateral
attack
and
the
rights
that
were
being
given
up
in
boykin
were
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
which
is
the
same
thing
that
is
taking
place
when
you
enter
to
a
guilty
plea
and
if
you
waive
your
right
to
counsel.
they
are
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
he
challenged
his,
procedurally--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--on
direct
appeal
he
went
straight
from
the
circuit
court
on
his
motion
to
suppress
the
entry
of
the
convictions
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--the
'87
conviction?
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
correct--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
yes,
he
could
have.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
yes.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
he
didn't
do
that.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
my
position
is
that
this
is
not
now
a
collateral
attack
of
those
convictions.
he
is
not
seeking--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--my
position
is
that
now
they
are
final
and
the
state
of
kentucky
wants
to
use
them
to
prove
the
present
crime
of
being
a
persistent
felony
offender.
they
must
prove
those
elements
of
that
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
when
they
enter
the
conviction,
at
that
point
he
may
challenge--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--that's
correct.
once
the
defendant
alleges
that
the
convictions
are
not
constitutionally
valid--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--once
the
defendant
alleged
that
they
were
not
constitutionally
valid
and
there
is
not
a
silent
record,
the
presumption
is
then
in
the
defendant's
favor
that
he
did
not
waive
his
constitutional
rights,
and
there
is
no
record
there
to
prove
that
he
did.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
the
state
of
kentucky
states
it
is
a
conviction.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
legislature
meant
that
it
meant
an
invalid
conviction
or
a
conviction
that
was
not
constitutionally
valid.
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
legislature
when
they
said
conviction,
that
it
meant
a
conviction
that
was
valid
under
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
i'm
attacking
its
use.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
i'm
not
attacking
the
conviction
at
all.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that
is
the
distinction
that
i've
been
trying
to
establish
here.
thank
you
for
bringing
that
up.
this,
we
are
not
attacking,
or
he
is
not
seeking
relief
from
the
'81
or
from
the
'79
one.
he
is
not--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that
was
a
long--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--the
state
in
the
sentencing
phases
can
establish
any
elements
that
it
wants
as
long
as
they
are
within
parameters
in
order
to
enhance
the
defendant's
sentence.
this
is
not
the
same
as
like
in
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
where
they
have
adopted
certain
elements
to
be
used
in
the
sentencing
phase.
this,
mr.
raley
is
being
convicted
of
a
crime
and
to
prove
the
crime
they
must
show
all
the
elements,
prove
all
elements.
one
of
the
elements
is
a
conviction.
that's
all
the
state
said
there,
and
that's
where
we
go
back
to
the
waiver
of
counsel
cases.
and
basically
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
is
to
say
under
boykin
if
the
record
is
silent
it
is
presumed
that
that
conviction
is
invalid
constitutionally,
and
then
they
have
a
hearing.
and
the
sixth
circuit's
ruling
was
the
hearing
should
be
redone
in
the
state
of
kentucky
using
the
correct
federal
standard.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
i
don't
believe
i
understood
that.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
i'm
asserting
that
this
is
not
a
collateral,
that
this
is
not
a
collateral
attack
of
those
prior
convictions.
there
are
issues
raised
about
stone
v.
powell
being
a
prophylactic
rule,
first
off
it
was
alleged
that
those
could
not
be
addressed
here
by
this
court
because
they
were
not
raised
in
the
lower
courts,
were
not
considered
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
their
opinion,
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
cert.
it
wasn't
until
the
final
briefs
here
that
that
came
up.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
my
response
is
the
same
as
with
justice
scalia,
was
that
by
using
the
word
convict
in
the
statute
that
the
legislature
placed
in
there
or
assumed,
although
we
cannot
assume
what
they
meant
because
they
have
to
state
exactly,
but
they
used
the
word
to
convict,
and
that
it
would
not
have
been
an
assumption
to
use
an
invalid
conviction
or
a
constitutionally
invalid
conviction.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that
is...
yes.
and
if
they
were,
if
the
state
of
kentucky,
they
decided
the
case
of
gadd
v.
commonwealth
which
was
based
upon
burgett
v.
texas,
and
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
state
of
kentucky,
the
supreme
court
there,
was
wrong
when
it's
not
following
burgett.
the
state
of
kentucky
in
essence
would
not
allow
any
defendant
to
come
back
and
challenge
any
conviction
that
was
used
on
the
pfo
whether
or
not
he
had
counsel
or
not
under
that
scenario.
i
believe
that
these
rights
that
you
waive
when
you
enter
a
guilty
plea
are
equal
to
the
right
to
counsel.
in
fact
in
the
case
of
the
supreme
court
of
duke
v.
warden
you
all
know
that
the
waiver,
or
the
entering
of
a
guilty
plea
is
one
of
the
most
devastating
waivers
that
there
is
because
you
are
giving
up
three
constitutional
rights
at
one
time,
and
the
right
to
counsel,
that
you
can't
put
a
hierarchy
between
those
constitutional
rights.
and
if
a
defendant
has
waived
his
right
to
trial,
right
to
call
witnesses,
or
right
to
be
free
from
self-incrimination,
that
those
are
just
as
important
as
his
right
to
counsel.
he
should
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
a
guilty
plea
that
is
being
used
to
prove
a
present
crime.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
he
did
have
counsel
in
this
instance,
yes,
he
did.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
the
factual--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--that's
almost
a
distinction
between
a
confession--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--a
confession.
it
would
have
been--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--it
could
have
been
equivalent
to
a
confession,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
at
all
as
a
conviction.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
you
could
confess--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--he
did
plead
guilty.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
with
his
plea
of
guilty
that
is
what
takes
place.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
i
do
not
know
the
specific
facts
of
what
mr.
raley
did
or
whether
or
not
the
facts
actually
constitute
the
crime.
the
record
is
not
there
to
show
and
i
cannot
state
to
this
court
that
his
plea
of
guilty
was
a
admission
or
a
confession
as
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
because
there
is
not
a
record
to
tell
me
that.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
a
plea
of
guilty
is
an
admission
to
all
the
elements
of
the
crime.
maybe
i'm
not
seeing
the
distinction
that
you're
trying
to
make.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
knowing
and
intelligent.
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
kentucky
has
created
a
record
so
that
those
convictions
may
be
reviewed
later,
and
that's
what
boykin
was
so
insistent
upon.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
whether
or
not
boykin--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--what...
the
constitution
guarantees
certain
rights
to
the
defendants,
and
then
boykin
is
interpreted
to
mean
that
those
rights
must
be
told
to
the
defendants
on
the
record
and
the
court
has
the
duty
to
advise
those
defendants
on
the
record
of
those
constitutional
rights.
but
in
essence
if
a
defendant
has
constitutional
rights
he
is
not
aware
of
they
are
not
of
any
substantial
use
to
him.
i
believe
that
is
the
purpose
behind
boykin,
to
advise
the
defendants
of
their
rights,
and
it
places
a
duty
upon
the
court
to
make
sure
that
he
is
aware
of
those
rights.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
the
way
the--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
yes,
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
in
the
instance
when
you're
using
the
conviction
to
prove
a
present
crime--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--but
the
habeas
corpus
is
distinct
from
that--
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
--because
it's
not
being
used
to
convict
a
defendant
of
a
present
crime.
a
habeas
is
a
collateral
attack
for
relief
but
is
not
establishing
any
new
present
crime
of
a
persistent
felony
offender
status.
the
state
of
kentucky
could,
the
legislature
could
rewrite
their
sentencing
rules,
and
if
they
did
we
may
not
be
here,
but
they
haven't.
they
have
used
the
word
conviction.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
well,
the
collateral
attack
is
used
in
a
habeas
proceeding,
the
distinction
that
i'm
trying
to
maintain.
mr.
j.
gregory
clare
that
may
be
true
and
your
analogy
may
be
correct,
but
it
is
very
distinguishable
from
a
habeas
proceeding,
and
that's
what
i'm...
the
point
is
that
on
the
habeas
proceeding
the
defendant
may
be
greatly
limited.
but
here
it
is
not
a
habeas
proceeding,
it's
the
correct
procedure
to
use
in
the
lower
court
level
when
they're
proving
a
persistent
felony
offender.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i'm
trying
to
draw.
the
petitioner
would
have
the
state
of
kentucky
allow
the
presumption
of
regularity
of
the
prior
convictions
to
overcome
its
presumption
against
the
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right.
we
submit
that
the
presumption
against
the
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
waiver
of
counsel
cases,
is
a
much
greater
presumption
than
the
interest
of
having
a
presumption
of
regularity
for
the
prior
convictions.
it
was
also
discussed
the
burden
of
proof
that
would
take
place
in
the
hearing
if
the
sixth
circuit
has
remanded
it
back
to
the
state
of
kentucky,
and
what
is
the
proper
burden
of
proof.
because
this
court
has
said
in
the
right
to
counsel
cases
that
those
convictions
are
presumptively
invalid,
we
believe
that
the
burden
of
proof
here
should
be
at
least
a
clear
and
convincing
burden
of
proof.
they
have
asserted
that
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
cited
johnson
v.
zerbst,
but
johnson
v.
zerbst
was
entered
long
before
the
right
to
counsel
cases
have
come
into
play.
and
the
right
to
counsel
cases
would
support
at
least
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof
in
placing
the
burden
upon
the
commonwealth
to
prove
that
the
conviction
is
constitutionally
valid.
thank
you.
