justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
make
the
argument
below
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
for
purposes
of
federal
habeas
corpus
this
kind
of
a
claim
was
not
entertainable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
making
an
argument
here
that
wasn't
made
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
it
subsumed?
tell
me
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
state
court
was
in
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
part
of
your
submission
is
that
the
guilty
plea
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that
he
was
actually
guilty
of
the
offenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
don't,
just
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
advised
doesn't
mean
that
he
didn't
admit
that
he
committed
the
offenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
voluntariness,
the
voluntariness
requirement
doesn't
necessarily,
if
ignored
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
didn't
admit
to
the
offenses
and
that
his
admission
is
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
did
plead
guilty,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn't
he,
didn't
he
agree
that
he
committed
the
offenses
charged?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
you're
not,
you're
not
saying
that
these
convictions
were
invalid
in
the
sense
that
he
didn't
commit
the
offense,
it's
just
that
he
wasn't
advised
properly
in
pleading
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you're
contending
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
kentucky
courts
in
an
enhancement
proceeding
to
entertain
attacks
on
prior
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
kentucky
court
did
entertain
the
attack--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
i
suppose
you
contend
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
them
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence,
and
similarly
you
think
the
federal
constitution
requires
a
federal
habeas
court
to
entertain
those
claims
of
the
invalidity
of
prior
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
an
enhancement.
