mr.
warren
j.
daheim
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
might
ask
why
a
person
would
build
a
four-unit
apartment
specially
designed
for
the
handicapped
and
the
elderly
in
the
town
of
froid,
montana,
a
town
of
less
than
400
people
located
in
a
remote
corner
of
that
state.
that's
one
of
the
projects
in
this
lawsuit.
and
the
answer
is,
they
built
that
project
because
hud
made
certain
promises,
and
hud
made
those
promises
in
writing,
a
writing
that
was
drawn
by
the
government
attorneys,
a
writing
which
specifically
said
it
was
assignable
for
financing
purposes,
a
writing
that
specifically
provide...
provided
that
the
government's
promises
were
backed
by
the
full
faith
of
the
united
states
government.
one
of
those
promises,
and
the
reason
why
we
are
here
today,
was
a
written
promise
of
annual
rent
adjustments
based
on
factors
published
annually
in
the
federal
register
together
with
the
basis
for
those
factors,
so
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
look
in
the
federal
register,
you
got
your
factor,
if
it
was
5
percent
you
multiplied
that
by
last
year's
rents,
and
there
you
were
for
the
coming
year.
there
was
no
hassle,
there
was
no
ambiguity,
you
didn't
have
to
have
a
friend
at
hud,
you
didn't
have
to
worry
about
having
an
enemy
at
hud.
uncontested
affidavits
in
this
case
show
that
these
plaintiffs
would
never
have
entered
into
these
contracts
without
that
provision.
if
they
had
had
a
clue
that
somehow
hud
was
claiming
the
right,
as
they
did
have
under
section
236,
to
apply
a
subjective,
project-by-project,
unpublished
method,
they
would
have
run
out
of
the
room.
this
project
never
would
have
gotten
off
the
ground.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
pardon?
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
read
it
that
way.
the
owners
didn't
read
it
that
way.
the
lenders
didn't
read
it
that
way.
hud
did
not
read
it
that
way
for
almost
7
years,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
all
that
does...
what
it
does
not
say,
your
honor...
what
it
clearly
does
not
say
is
what
the
statute
does
now
say,
and
that
is
that
if
our
factors...
if
there's
something
wrong
with
the
factors
that
we
picked,
we
can
then
flip
to
a
different
method,
a
project-by-project
subjective--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--well--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--by
the
rule,
your
honor,
that
says
you
should
first
make
every
attempt
to
harmonize
the
language,
and
if
you
harmonize
that
language
with
the
beginning
language,
which
says
that
we
have
a
factor
system,
that
language
is
easily
harmonized,
and--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--that
language
is
necessary
to
find
out
what
those
factors
are
supposed
to
be.
the
first
paragraph
simply
talks
about
factors.
they
could
be...
if
with
nothing
more,
i
guess
they
could
be
the
price
of
rice,
the
price
of
cattle,
the
price,
for
instance,
of
what's
happening
in
operating
expenses,
for
instance,
and
that,
incidentally,
was
a
position
that
the
government
tried
to
take
in
1983,
and
the
congress
told
them
it
was
wrong.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
well,
that's,
of
course,
buying
the
government's
language
of
the
word
"override",
and
the
word
"override"
is
not
in
there.
the
word
"trump"
is
not
in
there.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
webster's
dictionary
defines
"notwithstanding"
as
"however",
which
is
a
very
soft
word.
it
does
not
define
it
as
meaning
"trump",
your
honor.
that
is
a...
there
is
nothing
project-specific
in
that
language
as
there
is
in
the
preceding
special
adjustment
section.
the
special--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--they're
published
on
an
area
basis.
for
instance
california
right
now
has
13
different
factors.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
oh,
no,
never
were
intended...
i--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
this,
was
to
get
away,
among
other
things,
from
section
236,
which
was
project-specific,
so
that
what
i'm
saying
here
under
the
special
adjustments,
it's
clearly
project-specific.
it
uses
the
contract
term
for
the
units.
in
other
words,
it
uses
the
word,
"contract
units".
you
don't
see
that
in
the
overall
limitation.
it
says,
"owners".
the
special
adjustment
is
not
for
general
operating
expenses,
as
counsel
for
the
government
indicated,
it's
for
something
very
specific,
and
that
is,
if
you
are
affected,
your
specific
project
is
affected
by
taxes
and
utilities
that
are
out
of
line
for
the
area
and
so
forth,
then
you
can
apply.
interestingly,
after
the
'89
amendment,
they
subsequently
amended
it
again
in
1990,
and
that's...
that
provision
now
provides
for
additional
special
adjustments
if
you're
running
into
problems
in
your
project
with
drugs,
and
they
use
specifically
the
word,
"project
by
project".
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
oh,
yes.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
under
both.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
i...
it's
used
in
conjunction
with
both.
it's
a
guide
for
both.
this
is
language
that
you
find
in
the
statue
itself.
to
begin
with,
that
is
a
statute
that
covers
more
than
one
program.
it
covers
not
only
the
new
construction
program--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--i
think
it
operates
differently
with
respect
to
the
two.
with
respect
to
the
special
adjustments,
once
again,
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
an
override.
it's
a
guide
to
whoever
is
making
those
determinations.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
secretary
would
have...
it's
giving
the
secretary
a
certain
amount
of
latitude.
you
look
at
it
one
way
with
respect
to
what
is
that
latitude
in
the
factors,
and
secondly
it
seems
to
me
that
that
secretary
can
even
go
above
those
factors
and
make
a
separate
project-by-project
determination
of
what
is
a
material
difference
when
they're
faced
with
the
issue
on
a
project-by-project
basis
of
whether
they
should
get
a
special
adjustment
because
of
the
tax
situation
in
that...
for
that
project.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
that's
exactly
right,
they
can...
they...
pardon?
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
well,
it...
once
again,
back
to
the
ninth
circuit's
position
on
this.
hud
wants
to
treat
this
language
as
saying
these
factors
are
coming
out
of...
off
the
wall.
they
seem
to
be...
they're
totally
unrelated
to
their
factors
that
they
themselves
select.
they
select
these
factors...
it
seems
the
most
logical
meaning
of
that
language
is
that
when
you
are
selecting
those
factors,
and
clearly
they
can
select
the
factors
and
make
those
determinations,
they
can
come
up
with
subareas,
whatever
subareas
they
think
are
appropriate,
but
having
made
that
decision,
that's
where
this
thing
is
functional.
now,
actually,
it's
sort
of
strange,
because
the
government...
another
branch
of
the
government
was
here
last
week
arguing
basically
my
position
in
another
case,
saying
that
we
have
a
framework.
my
lord,
how
can
we
go
to
ad
hoc,
standardless
determinations
after
the
fact?
now,
that's
exactly
the
position
that
they
are
arguing
for
here,
ad
hoc
positions
without
a
standard
whatsoever,
and
that's
what
they
did.
they
didn't
publish
regulations
on
it.
it
was
at
the
whim
of
the
local
office,
and
if
there
was
anything
that
these
owners
were
paranoid
about,
and
with
good
reason
in
retrospect,
was
being
subjected
to
a
project-by-project
subjective
analysis.
now,
we
can
sit
here
20
years
afterwards
and
pick
the
bones
on
this
stuff,
but
this
language
does
not
give
a
clue
that
they
can
depart
from
their
own
factors
and
on
an
individual
basis
go
on
out
and
tell
you
now
you're
not
only
not
going
to
get
your
factors,
but
let's
quit
using
the
word
"cap"...
they
cut
the
rents
out
there.
now,
that
was
the
position.
our
position
was
the
same
position
as
hud
had
for
7
years.
they
published
regulations
on
it.
they
told
their
local
offices
how
to
deal
with...
if
they
were
having
problems
out
there--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--well,
not
only
did
they
publish
regulations,
they
published
a
handbook
telling
their
local
offices
how
to
do
it,
and
i'm
suggesting
in
the
affidavits
we
filed,
your
honor,
that
that's...
they
were
giving
seminars
and
telling
the
owners
that
that's
what
it
meant.
and
in
'81,
when
the
program's
dead,
when
politically
it's
unpopular,
when
it's
not
a
production
device
any
more,
with
these
owners
now
trapped
into
these
20-year
contracts,
then's
when
they
come
along
and
say,
we
can
sit
in
our
office,
call
around,
and
if
we
can
find
some
rents
cheaper
than
yours,
we
can
cut
your
rents.
now,
how
you
get
that
out
of
this
contract
that
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
owners,
not
the
government
who
drafted
it...
as
i
say,
what
is
very
revealing
is
that
now
under
801,
when
they
wanted
to
make
something
clearer,
they
did
make
it
clearer,
and
now
that
statute
reads
that
if
the
secretary,
after
publishing
all
of
these
factors,
then
finds
that
applied
to
a
particular
project...
the
words
particular
project...
then
they
can
use
an
alternate
methodology.
well
now,
if
that
was
in
there,
we
wouldn't
be
here,
because
you
wouldn't
have
a
program.
for
7
years,
the
economic
and
marketing
analysis
division
of
hud
each
year...
and
these
fellows
are
experts...
carefully
selected
factors
and
areas
for
this
country.
in
addition
to
that...
and
i
would
suggest
that
you
look
at
the
back
of
our
response
to
the
government's
petition
for
cert,
in
which
we
published
those
methodologies
from
'80
and
'81,
to
give
some
flavor
of
how
carefully
they
went
through
those...
that
exercise.
they
were
statistically
accurate.
they
tell
their
local
field
offices,
starting
in
1976
when
they
first
published
these
factors...
they
publish
the
factors,
and
they
tell
the
public,
look,
maybe
there's
a
better
way
to
do
this.
let's
have
your
suggestions.
the
next
year
they
come
out
and
they
revise
24
cfr
888.202
to
say
to
the
local
offices
once
again,
if
these
factors
are
not
good
for
your
area,
publish
another
factor,
and
that's
what
they
can
do,
and
of
course
that's
what
they
have
been
doing.
and
then
after
7
years,
when
they
don't
need
this
program
any
more
for
these
people,
and
they're
trapped
into
it,
all
of
a
sudden
they
start
making
these
ad
hoc
and
capricious
studies,
and
once
again
i
would
refer
you
to
appendix
a
of
our
brief
that
gives
an
example
of
the
process
that
was
described
by
an
mai
as
farcical.
farcical.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
no.
you
have...
you
have
no...
what
happened...
and
they
didn't
send
appraisers
out.
i
mean,
that's...
they
didn't
send
appraisers
out.
they
call
around
and
they
get
cheaper
rents
and
they
tell
you,
and
then
they
say,
you
can
challenge
it.
they
have
no
procedures
for
challenging
the
thing.
you'd
go
up
there,
and
i
went
up
there...
i
brought
a
court
reporter
up
there.
they
wouldn't
let
me
cross-examine
anybody.
you're
in
front
of
the
person
who
just
cut
your
rents,
arguing
that
they
made
a
mistake,
and
where
do
you
go
from
there?
you
bring
an
mai
appraiser
in.
they
don't
have
to
listen
to
that
appraiser,
and
they
didn't
listen
to
these
appraisers.
you're
completely
at
their
mercy.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
no.
there
was
nothing.
they
had
no
regulations,
they
had
no
system,
they
had
nothing.
they
still
don't
have
it.
they
finally,
after
almost
4
years
after
801,
under
which
they
were
supposed
to
publish
regulations
for
comparability
within
6
months,
they
finally
in
october
of
last
year
finally
published
some
proposed
ones.
i
understand
they're
having
such
big
problems
already,
they
still
haven't
published
final
regulations--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--but
that
doesn't
give
you
any
procedure.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
i
would
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
no.
no,
absolutely.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
that's
exactly
right.
the
trial
court
did.
we
went
on
with
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
found
that
what
they
were
doing
was
completely
standardless
and
violated
the
due
process
clause.
that
was
not
appealed.
well,
it
was
appealed,
but
that
appeal
was
dropped
by
the
government.
the
ninth
circuit
basically
said,
look,
the
statute
provided
for
an
objective,
or
formula
system,
and
a
market
studies
system,
and
we're
not
going
to
let
you
go
through
the
back
door
now
after
having
made
that
election,
and
that's
how
it's
construed,
the
so-called
overall
limitation.
going
on
to
the...
assuming
the
contract
right,
after
that
hud
said
we
will
now
comply
with
that
in
the
ninth
circuit.
of
course,
they
didn't.
they
went
to
congress
and
they
had
this
provision
tacked
on
to
the
housing
reform
bill
of
1989,
which
basically,
in
essence,
tells
the
ninth
circuit
they're
wrong,
and
gives
these
people
who
have
already
been
victimized
by
hud
approximately
30
percent
of
what
they
were
entitled
to,
and
prospectively
tells
hud
that
they
can
do
now,
again
in
the
future,
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
now
told
them
they
cannot
do.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
they
made
a
new
contract,
absolutely.
absolutely.
if...
first
of
all,
this
right
is
vested,
and
that
goes
into
the...
basically,
the--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--well,
what...
well,
that's
until
they
publish
their
new
regulations,
and
since
those
still
aren't
out,
you
would
continue
to
get
only
30
percent
until
whenever
these
new
regulations
come
out,
finally.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
that's
sort
of
a
shorthand.
what
they
specifically
said
is
that
you
will
get
your
factor,
but
not
on
the
full
dollar
amount
of
the
rent.
you
will
get
it
on
the
full
dollar
amount
less
your
mortgage
amount.
so
in
other
words,
the
only
person
who
gets
the
full
factor
amount
is
if
you're
mortgage-free,
if
you're
debt-free.
if
you've
got
a
70
or
80
percent
mortgage
on
there,
you
get
the
factor
only
based
on
your
20
percent.
i
mean,
where
they
came
up
with
that,
it's...
that
isn't,
in
fact,
irrational.
the
response
is
irrational.
if
they
were
dealing
with
bad
factors,
you
would
go
on
out
nationwide
and
talk
about...
and
have
some
response
that
addressed
these
factors.
i
mean,
even
if
you
were
talking
about
windfalls
in
some
kind
of
a
way,
you
would
do
like
they
did
in
'76,
when
the
oil
prices
went
up,
and
in
some
rational
basis
try
to
determine
who
got
windfalls
and
who
didn't,
but
this
thing
is
completely
irrational.
all
it
concentrates
on
are
these
poor
folks
who
already
had
this
process
imposed
upon
them.
let
me
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
comment
once
again
on
the
process,
because
i
want
to
talk
again...
and
i
gave
this
example
of
this
fellow
in
froid,
montana,
to
give
some
kind
of
a
feel
that
this
isn't
some
big
city
thing.
that
guy
in
froid
is
a
member
of
this
class
because
he
could
afford
to
be
part
of
a
hundred
people.
he
couldn't
afford
to
challenge
hud,
and
they
know
it.
you
can't
get
an
appraiser,
you
can't
get
an
attorney,
you
can't
go
through
that
process,
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
the
beauty
of
this
thing.
let's
get
the
private
sector
to
go
on
out
and
do
what
we
bungled.
we
bungled
it
with
public
housing,
we
bungled
it
under
section
23
where
we
tried
to
manage
these
projects,
we
bungled
it
under
section
236
and
wound
up
having
to
take
these
things
back.
it
was
a
process
where
the
owner
was
supposed
to
make
money
or
lose
money.
the
owner
was
supposed
to
go
on
out
and
get
his
own
financing,
so
if
the
project
goes
into
default
the
government
doesn't
wind
up
with
it,
and
the
only
way
they
could
sell
that
was
to
tell
these
owners,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
rent
adjustment
process
that
we're
not
going
to
have
our
finger
in.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
f-r--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--froid.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
pardon?
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
talked
to
the
owner
and
he
said
it
was
froid.
he
lives
up
in
plentywood,
by
the
way.
[laughter]
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
well,
i
mean,
he
just
wouldn't
have
gone
into
the
program.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
and
our
evidence
is
that
nobody
would
have
gone
into
this
program,
because
that
was
the
essence...
that
was
the
essence
of
that
program.
i
do
want
to
respond
to
the
issue
on
deference,
however--
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
--because
it
was
raised
before.
first
of
all,
seckinger
says
that
you
do
give
deference
to
the
customer
and
not
the
government,
who,
of
course,
draws
the
contract.
city
of
fulton,
which
they...
they're
spouting
chevron
in
their
primary
brief.
i
respond
to
it
obviously
as
inapplicable,
and
then
of
course
they
come
back
in
their
reply
brief
when
i
can't
answer
it
and
put
in
the
city
of
fulton.
the
city
of
fulton,
however,
is
not
applicable
for
two
or
three
reasons.
number
1,
it
seems,
your
honor,
that
the
contract
did
nothing
more
than
mirror
that
statute.
this
contract
does
something
more
than
mirror
the
statute.
it
has
a
choice
in
the
contract.
number
2,
in
fulton,
they
said
that
there
was
no
other
evidence
of
what
the
parties'
intent
was.
here
there
is
other
evidence.
we
haveaffidavits,
we
have
their
position,
we
have
the
regulations
on
the
thing,
and
thirdly,
your
honor,
you'd
have
to
ask
what...
deference
to
what?
their
position
has
moved
three
times,
and
now
congress
has
said
there
is
a
fourth
position
that
you
should
adopt,
and
they
still
haven't
adopted
it.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
yes.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
mr.
dreeben
is
right,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
my
understanding
is,
i
mean,
it's
pretty
much
whatever
the
local
offices...
if
you
wanted
to
be
a
hero,
you
went
out
and
did
it.
mr.
warren
j.
daheim
pardon?
no,
the
program
has
not...
it's
just
not
used
any
more.
it's
still
there,
but
it
hasn't
really
been
used
since
'81
as
a
major
vehicle
for
production
any
more.
they...
in
'81
they
made
some
other
changes
to
the
thing
that
really
cut...
they
made
it
a
limited
dividend
program,
for
instance,
and
they...
then
they
did
start
to
also
furnish
some
mortgages.
it
becomes
a
tax
shelter
program
which
was
not
the
program
that
it
started
out
to
be
and
not
the
program
under
which
this
contract
was
drafted.
well,
as
long
as
i
still
have
a
couple
of
minutes
here,
i
will
go
on
with
the...
on
the
constitutional
side,
they
asked
on...
was
there
a
substantial
impairment.
that
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
that's
something
that's
determined
at
the
trial
level.
we
put
in
affidavits.
if
they
had
some
complaints
about
that,
if
they
had
some
objection
to
that,
they
should
have
objected
at
that
time.
we
could
have
had
a
trial.
for
instance,
in
the
u.s.
trust
v.
new
jersey,
they
had
an
extensive
trial.
you
build
a
record
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
substantial.
we
claim
it's
substantial
because
it
was
not
only
a
material
inducement,
it
was
a
critical
inducement.
that
seems
to
be
the
rule
under
worthen
v.
kavanaugh,
under
the
el
paso-simmons
case.
how
substantial
is
it?
i
don't
think
the
government
could
contest
the
fact
that
these
owners
would
simply
not
have
entered
into
this
contract
without
this
provision.
finally,
on
purpose,
we
think
that
whatever
the
level
of
scrutiny,
we
think
it
should
be
careful,
at
least,
because
the
government
is
here
dealing
with
its
own
contracts,
but
on...
even
on
a
rational
basis
analysis,
the
government
cannot
do
this
simply
to
save
money,
and
that
is
basically
their
only
reason.
the
only
other
reason
they
now
give
is
uniformity,
which
is
a
euphemism
for
saying
that
we
want
to
be
able
to
break
our
contract
with
everybody.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
this
court
very
much.
