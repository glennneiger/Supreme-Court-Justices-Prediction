of
course,
if
you
have
your
formulas
set
unrealistically
enough...
that
is,
high
enough...
you
would
always
have
this
case-by-case
adjustment
applicable,
which
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
requiring
the
formula.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
congress
has
required
in
the
statute
that
there
be
the
adjustment
formula,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
idea
what
percentage
of
the
projects
were
reevaluated
in
this
fashion?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
could
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions
about
your
first
point?
do
you
acknowledge
that
this
contract
should
be
interpreted,
in
the
case
of
ambiguity,
against
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're...
you're
not
saying
chevron
applies
to
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
applies
to
the
statute
and
somehow
gets
parlayed
into
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
to
say
that
the
agency
should
be
careful
when
it
draws
up
the
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
a
notwithstanding
thought,
it
really
isn't.
that's
a...
you
know,
by
the
way,
in
doing
it,
do
it
this
way.
you
wouldn't
convey
that
thought
by
saying,
notwithstanding
what
we've
said
about
the
adjustments.
you'd
say...
you'd
say,
i
don't
know,
in
the
course
of
making
those
adjustments
is
what
you'd
say.
you
wouldn't
say,
notwithstanding.
i
mean,
you
say
it
means
"however".
i
think
it
means,
"despite"...
despite
those
adjustments,
and
you're
saying,
it
doesn't
really
mean
"despite",
it
means
"in
the
process
of".
that's
basically
what
you
say
it
means,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
their
position.
you
mean
they
just...
they
would
say
they
just
didn't
invoke
(d).
is
there
anything
to
say
that
they
thought
(d)
meant
what
you
say
it
means,
other
than
the
fact
that
they
didn't
choose
to
use
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
as
though
there's
any
presumption
of
accuracy
given
to
these
studies
that
they
conduct,
right?
i
mean,
i
understand
it
costs
you
money,
i
suppose,
to
contest
their
comparability
studies,
but
what
is
the
status
of
the
comparability
studies?
doesn't
hud
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
regular
standard
factors
do
not
provide
adequate
rent?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can't
believe
you
don't
have
a...
don't...
you
have
no
right
to
have
an
administrative
law
judge
determine
the
accuracy
of
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you
come
into
district
court
when
your
rent
is
cut,
and
you
say
that
the
government
hasn't
established
that
in
fact
the
adjustments
resulted
in
material
differences,
and
the
burden
would
be
on
hud
to
establish
that
it
does,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
daheim--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
agree
with
mr.
dreeben
that
this
has
not
been
a
general
revision
of
everybody's
rents?
i
mean,
is
it
just
spotty,
or
have
they
done
this
in
such
a
thoroughgoing
fashion
that
you
can
say
that
the
annual
adjustment
factors
don't
really
mean
anything
any
more?
