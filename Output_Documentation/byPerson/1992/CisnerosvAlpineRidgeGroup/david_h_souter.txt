justice
david
h.
souter
--the
clue
was
in
subsection
(d),
wasn't
it?
you
may
or
may
not
want
to
read
it
the
way
your
brother
does,
but
there
is
a
clue
that
there's
something
there
that
you
better
worry
about,
isn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why...
as
a
textual
matter,
why
is
the
government's
reading
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
about
just
the
text
of
the
contractual
terms.
what
is
the
nub
of
your
argument
that
the
government
is
wrong?
i
know
you
say--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
point
of
the
contractual
term
is
that
it
is
indicating
the
way
you
ought
in
effect
to
construe
other
possible
contractual
terms,
but
what
textually
supports
you
in
a
phrase
that
begins,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
contract?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may...
i
guess
the
problem
that
i'm
having
with
your
position
is,
i
think
you're
reading
the
language,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision",
as
if
it
read,
"in
construing
any
other
provision",
and
it
seems
to
me
that
by
beginning
with
a
"notwithstanding
any
other"
it's
a
classic
example
of
a
kind
of
override
language,
which
is
the
way
the
government's
reading
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
will
grant
you
that
there
is...
that
one
of
the
difficulties
in
applying
the
automatic
adjustment
language
is
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
explain
on
its
face
what's
going
to
be
the
basis
for
the
adjustment,
but
coming
back
to
the
text
that
concerns
me,
aren't
we
dealing
here
with
something
which,
at
least
on
its
face,
is
couched
in
terms
of
an
override
of
something
else
as
opposed
to
a
construction
of
something
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
word
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision"
is
in
there,
and
i
am
suggesting
that
i
think
we
usually
read
this
as
a
kind
of...
as
a
kind
of
trump,
in
your
term,
and
why
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
the
special
adjustment
section
project-specific?
mr....
i
mean,
it
doesn't
look
it
to
me,
and
mr.
dreeben
at
least
represented
that
the
adjustments
are
calculated
and
published,
i
guess
i
should
say,
on
an
area
basis
rather
than
a
project
basis.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in
any
case,
they
are
not
project-specific.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i...
maybe
i've
missed
a
point
along
the
way.
are
you
agreeing
that
the
overall
limitation,
that
(d)
is
in
fact
a
limitation
on
special
adjustments
that
can
be
made
under
(c)?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
(d)
is
a
limitation
on
(c),
why
isn't
it
equally
a
limitation
on
(b),
because
the
language
of
(d)
starts
out
by
saying,
notwithstanding
any
other
provisions,
in
the
plural,
adjustments
as
provided
in
this
section
shall
not
result
in
material
difference,
and
those
adjustments
include
both
the
special
adjustments
under
(c),
and
the
automatic
adjustments
under
(b).
so
if
you
agree
that
(d)
is
an
override
to
(c),
why
aren't
you
committed
to
agreeing
that
it's
an
override
to
(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
just
the
contract
for
a
minute.
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
terms
of
the
contract,
and
if
(d)
is
couched
in
the
plural,
if
its
possible
referents
are
(c)
and
(b),
and
you
agree
that
(d)
functions
as
an
override
to
(c),
or
a
trump
to
(c),
however
you
want
to
put
it,
why
aren't
you
committed
to
the
conclusion
that
it
also
functions
likewise
with
respect
to
(b)?
