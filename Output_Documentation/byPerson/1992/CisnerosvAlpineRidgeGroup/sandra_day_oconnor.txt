well,
mr.
dreeben,
now,
was
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
basically
that
that
provision
should
be
read
as
requiring
the
government
to
factor
in
those
differences
in
the
published
formula?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
read
in
light
of
the
statute,
could
it
be
thought
to
be
ambiguous
to
some
extent
as
to
whether
they're
going
to
make
these
comparability
studies
in
the
published
formula
or
whether
they're
going
to
do
it
separately
in
a
case-by-case
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i
said
was
the
contract
ambiguous,
read
in
light
of
the
statute,
which
contemplated,
apparently,
that
the
government
could
agree
in
these
contracts
to
a
formula
approach
to
the
adjustments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
why
did
the
government
concede
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
section
801
substantially
impaired
the
contract?
