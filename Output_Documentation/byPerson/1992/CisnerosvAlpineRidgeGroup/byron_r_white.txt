says
that
"notwithstanding"
has
several
meanings,
and
one
of
them
is
"despite",
and
that
is
as
a
preposition
rather
than
as
an
adverb
like
you
would
use
it.

i
suppose
you'd
say
they
weren't
about
to
listen
to
suggestions
that
the
contract
terms
ought
to
be
changed
because,
say
this

suppose

in
froid

have
hired
a
lawyer
and
he
read
that
contract,
he
certainly
should
have
a...
he
certainly
should
have
wondered
about
that
notwithstanding
clause,
and
he...
it
probably
wouldn't
have
done
him
a
bit
of
good
to
suggest
to
hud
we
ought
to
take
that
provision
out.
i
guess

i
guess
hud

it
or
leave
it.
