mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
due
process
challenge
to
a
federal
statute,
section
801
of
the
hud
reform
act,
which
revises
the
process
for
adjusting
rents
in
the
section
8
program.
section
8
provides
federally
subsidized
housing
for
low-income
tenants.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
statute
abrogates
contract
rights
between
section
8
project
owners
and
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
concluded
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
our
view,
that
holding
is
wrong
for
three
reasons:
first,
the
contract
right
on
which
the
owners
base
their
challenge
to
section
801,
the
right
to
be
free
of
individual
comparability
studies
when
rents
are
adjusted,
is
not
guaranteed
by
the
contracts
in
question.
as
a
result,
the
contract
claim
that
forms
the
basis
for
the
due
process
attack
does
not
exist.
second,
even
if
the
owners
had
the
contract
right
that
they
claim,
section
801
does
not
constitute
a
substantial
impairment
of
that
right
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
cases.
and
finally,
even
assuming
that
the
impairment
is
substantial
enough
to
warrant
further
inquiry,
section
801
satisfies
the
due
process
clause
because
congress
acted
rationally
and
permissibly
in
reforming
the
rent
adjustment
process
in
the
section
8
program
both
to
reinstate
the
program's
market
rent
premise
and
to
impose
uniform
national
standards.
now,
the
starting
point
in
this
case
is
the
assistance
contracts
that
the
project
owners
enter
into
with
hud
or
with
the
local
intermediaries.
respondents'
claim
is
that
they
have
a
contract
right
to
automatic
annual
rent
adjustments
each
year
based
on
a
published
hud
formula.
they
deny
that
under
the
contracts
hud
can
apply
a
cap
to
that
adjustment
based
on
the
results
of
what
has
been
called
a
comparability
study,
which
is
akin
to
an
appraisal
or
a
survey
of
local
comparable
rents
at
projects
that
do
not
receive
federal
assistance.
in
our
view,
the
language
of
the
contracts
is
dispositive.
it
appears
on
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief.
section
9
of
the
contract
first
provides
for
adjustments
based
on
a
published
factor
determined
by
hud,
but
the
contract
goes
on
to
provide
what
is
called
an
overall
limitation,
and
that
limitation
states:
"notwithstanding
any
other
provisions
of
this
contract,
adjustments
as
provided
in
this
section
shall
not
result
in
material
differences
between
the
rents
charged
for
assisted
and
comparable,
unassisted
units
as
determined
by
the
government.
"
now,
based
on
that
provision,
hud
conducted
its
comparability
studies...
surveys
of
market
rents
at
comparable
properties.
when
hud
concluded
that
the
adjustments
that
would
be
produced
under
the
factor
technique
would
produce
rents
that
materially
differed
from
those
charged
at
the
comparable
units,
it
used
the
comparability
studies
as
a
cap.
in
our
view,
the
contract
clearly
authorizes
this.
the
entire--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
this
overall
limitation
as
a
subordinate
guideline
for
hud
to
use
in
composing
the
factors,
and
in
our
view,
that
interpretation
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first,
it's
not
justified
by
the
plain
language
of
the
contract.
the
contract
simply
does
not
say
that
hud
must
use
this
overall
limitation
as
a
methodology
for
composing
the
factors.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
statute
itself,
in
our
view,
is
not
ambiguous
on
the
question
of
whether
comparability
studies
are
authorized.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
contract
is
at
all
ambiguous
read
in
light
of
the
statute.
the
contract
is,
if
anything,
far
clearer
on
this
point
than
the
statute.
the
contract
explicitly
uses
the
words,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provisions
of
this
contract.
"
as
a
way
of
indicating
that
when
there
is
a
collision
or
a
conflict
between
the
provision
dealing
with
published
adjustment
factors
and
the
substantive
standard
that
was
animating
this
program...
namely,
that
rents
shall
not
exceed
market-level
rents...
that
the
overall
limitation
provision
takes
precedence,
and
the
words
that
are
used
there
are
crystal-clear
on
that
point,
i
think.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
what
the
statute
actually
meant
about
it...
and
i
will
concede
that
the
statute
is
not
as
precise
as
the
contracts...
the
statute
is
entrusted
to
hud
to
administer,
and
hud,
exercising
the
authority
that
any
administrative
agency
has
in
this
situation,
has
promulgated
a
regulation
that
is
entitled,
"overall
limitation",
and
that
sets
forth
that
the
comparability
rule
that
is
parallel
to
the
statute
and
is
parallel
to
the
contracts
is
an
overall
limitation,
and
the
agency
has
interpreted
its
authority
under
that
rule
as
authorizing
comparability
studies.
now,
the
owners
in
this
case
have
made
much
of
the
fact
that
hud
did
not
in
the
very
earliest
years
of
the
program
conduct
comparability
studies,
but
i
think
that
claim
really
pales
against
the
historical
background
here.
the
program
was
enacted
in
1974.
the
first
published
adjustment
factor
wasn't
published
until
1976,
and
when
that
factor
was
published,
hud
recognized
that
there
could
be
some
problems
with
the
factors,
and
those
problems
arose
because
they
cover
extremely
wide
areas.
exact,
precise,
reliable
market
data
is
not
available
for
every
market
locality
in
the
country.
hud
had
to
rely
on
information
that
they
got
from
the
bureau
of
the
census
and
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics,
and
it
used
that
information
as
a
means
of
devising
what
it
believed
would
be
generally
accurate
factors,
but
it
recognized
that
the
factors
might
need
to
be
improved.
two
years
later,
in
1978,
an
internal
hud
task
force
report
noted
that
it
is
hud's
policy
that
field
offices
may
adjust
rents
up
or
down
based
on
the
results
of
an
individualized
comparability
study,
and
by
1981,
hud
had
found
out
that
there
were
sufficient
problems
in
certain
areas
that
required
the
use
of
comparability
studies
in
order
to
ensure
that
what
congress
intended
came
to
pass,
namely,
that
the
owners
got
annual
rent
adjustments
that
enabled
them
to
keep
pace
with
the
movement
of
the
market.
but
in
no
situation
were
those
adjustments
designed
to
produce
rents
that
were
materially
in
excess
of
what
comparable
projects
were
experiencing
in
the
area,
with
the
one
proviso
that
to
the
extent
that
there
was
any
such
initial
difference
when
the
contract
rents
were
set,
it
would
be
preserved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
did
concede
that
in
any
meaningful
sense.
we
did
not
specifically
raise
a
substantial
impairment
argument.
we
argued
that
the
owners
have
no
contract
right
to
formula-based
adjustments
without
the
use
of
a
comparability
cap.
we're
arguing
that
here
today.
in
the
alternative,
we
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
even
if
there
was
an
impairment
of
that
contract
right...
in
other
words,
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
been
correct
in
its
rainier
view
decision...
that
still
didn't
constitute
a
due
process
violation,
and
we
gave
many
reasons
for
that.
we
also,
in
the
lower
courts,
addressed
an
alternative
takings
analysis
that
had
been
proffered
by
the
respondents,
and
many
of
the
elements
involved
in
that
analysis
run
parallel
to
the
claim
we
make
today,
which
is
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
us
on
the
contract
and
find,
contrary
to
our
view,
in
the
clear
language
of
the
contract
that
there
was
a
contract
right,
as
the
ninth
circuit
saw
it,
even,
still,
the
federal
statute
at
issue
here
doesn't
constitute
a
substantial
impairment
of
that
contract
right
because
the
statute
also
preserves
the
same
financial
standard
that
was
always
in
this
program...
namely,
comparable
market
rents.
it
is
respondents'
burden,
who
are
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute,
to
satisfy
this
court
that
they
have
met
every
element
of
the
test
that
the
due
process
clause
requires,
and
in
our
view
they
have
not
met
the
burden
of
showing
substantial
impairment.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
gave
one
other
reason
on
the
contract
that
i
want
to
address.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
if
hud's
reading
of
the
contract
were
accepted,
the
election
by
hud
of
the
use
of
a
formula
would
be
nullified.
that
holding
does
not
follow
from
either
the
language
of
the
contract
or
the
language
of
the
statute.
hud
continued
throughout
this
program
to
use
the
formula
as
the
primary
mechanism
for
adjusting
rents.
it
published
the
formulas
every
year,
it
applied
them
to
the
projects,
but
what
it
did
do
was
to
apply
the
overall
limitation
as
written.
namely,
if
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
comparability
determinations
and
the
formula,
then
the
comparability
determination
took
precedence
to
the
extent
of
the
conflict,
and
that
is
not
a
nullification
of
the
formula,
it
simply
is
a
qualification
on
any
adjustment
that's
available
to
an
owner.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
exactly
right,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
comparability
survey
is
the
last
step
of
the
process,
and
i
think
what
makes
it
most
clear
that
this
is
an
independent
requirement
of
the
contract
is
that
the
contract
itself
provides
two
different
mechanisms
for
adjusting
rents
each
year.
first,
it
provides
the
factor
method
which
we've
been
discussing.
second,
the
contract
provides
for
special
adjustments
that
any
owner
can
seek
when
he
can
show
that
operating
costs
at
his
project
and
similar
projects,
or
at
his
project
alone,
have
increased
more
rapidly
than
is
taken
into
account
by
the
general
factor,
and
when
that
happens,
he
can
apply
for
a
specialized
increase
based
on
his
project
alone.
if
hud
agrees,
he
gets
that
increase,
subject
again
to
this
cap.
the
cap
applies
overall.
it
comes
at
the
end
of
the
section
dealing
with
the
rent
adjustments,
and
it
governs
both
of
the
prior
mechanisms
for
adjusting
rent
that
the
contract
and
the
statute
set
forth.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
you're
right,
justice
scalia,
that
if
hud
really
manipulated
the
adjustment
factor
in
such
a
way
so
that
it
was
never
applicable,
then
this
would
be
a
very
different
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
that's...
it
required
that
there
be
either
the
use
of
comparisons
of
fair
market
rentals
or
a
reasonable
formula,
and
hud
elected
the
reasonable
formula
approach,
but
the
point
here
is
that
the
factors
in
general
operation
are
not
inaccurate.
the
problem
arises
because
the
best
information
that
hud
could
get
during
this
period
covered
broad
areas.
for
example,
there
was
one
factor
that
governs
the
entire
washington,
d.c.
metropolitan
area,
which
includes
montgomery
county,
fairfax
county,
it
includes
a
variety
of
areas
in
which
economic
conditions
are
quite
different
from
each
other,
and
the
factor
may
as
an
overall
matter
be
working
just
fine
for
most
of
the
projects
that
are
located
in
that
region.
but
for
particular
projects,
it
might
be
quite
out
of
line,
and
it
was
to
deal
with
that
particularized
problem
that
hud
adopted
the
comparability
survey
technique,
it
was
not
as
a
method
of
circumventing
or
abandoning
the
factors
as
a
whole.
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
read
it
that
way,
but
the
record
really
doesn't
support
any
such
claim,
and
there
really
has
never
been
a
claim
in
this
case
that
hud
on
a
wholesale
basis
disavowed
factors.
it
continues
to
publish
them,
and
it's
attempting
to
perfect
them
all
the
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
record
does
not
show
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
have
been
reliable
statistics
that
would
be
publicly
available
that
would
show
that
kind
of
information.
but
again,
i
don't
think
that
the
respondents
have
ever
claimed
that
at
any
point
hud
ceased
to
publish
the
factors.
the
federal
register
reveals
that
they
did,
and
they
haven't
attempted
to
claim
that
most
or
any
substantial
component
of
the
projects
that
are
governed
by
the
factors
didn't
get
the
factor
increase.
now,
in
the
alternative,
and
only
if
this
court
concludes,
contrary
to
the
language
of
the
contract,
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
somehow
correct
and
what
hud
was
required
to
do
was
not
apply
the
comparability
survey
directly
but
to
work
it
into
the
factors,
or
to
revise
the
factors
in
response
to
a
comparability
survey,
then
our
alternative
submission
is
that
section
801
of
the
hud
reform
act
does
not
substantially
impair
the
rights
that
the
respondents
had
under
their
contracts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
kennedy,
to
my
knowledge
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
only
federal
court,
the
only
court
to
rule
on
this
issue.
there
have
since
the
passage
of
section
801
been
three
other
courts...
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
two
district
courts...
that
have
analyzed
the
constitutionality
of
section
801,
and
all
three
of
those
courts
found
that,
as
we
submit,
the
owners
never
had
a
contract-based
right
to
adjustment-formula
increases
free
from
comparability
caps,
and
they
therefore
terminated
the
constitutional
analysis
at
that
point.
when
congress
confronted
the
situation,
rainier
view
was
the
only
federal
court
to
have
ever
held
that
comparability
caps
could
not
be
used.
the
district
court
in
that
very
case
had
agreed
with
hud
that
comparability
caps
could
be
used,
but
had
held
that
hud
hadn't
implemented
them
properly,
there
hadn't
been
national
standards...
all
of
those
were
administrative
law
claims
which
the
district
court
conceptualized
under
the
guise
of
the
due
process
clause,
but
the
basic
thrust
was,
hud
hadn't
done
it
right.
the
ninth
circuit,
on
the
basis
of
its
reading
of
the
contract
language
against
the
background
of
the
statute,
announced
for
the
first
time
that
no,
hud,
you
may
not
use
comparability
studies.
where
that
left
hud
was
in
an
anomalous
position.
hud
had
not,
over
the
years,
changed
adjustment
factors
to
respond
to
imbalances
that
it
discovered
when
it
did
comparability
studies,
and
under
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling,
the
owners
were
in
a
position
to
claim
the
full
adjustment
factor
increase
for
each
year,
the
full
measure
of
it,
with
no
comparability
constraint,
because
hud
had
misunderstood
the
way
that
comparability
had
to
be
used,
at
least
as
the
ninth
circuit
saw
it.
so
congress
confronted
a
situation
in
which
a
program
that
had
always
been
designed
to
keep
rents
in
line
with
the
market,
subject
to
these
adjustment
procedures,
now
had
projects
in
it
that
could
claim
the
benefit
of
adjustments
that
would
put
it
far
in
excess
of
the
market,
and
these
adjustments
would
amount
to
windfalls
in
the
truest
sense,
because
they
resulted
only
because
the
agency
had
misunderstood
what
its
financial
obligations
were
under
the
contracts
when
it
readjusted
rents.
faced
with
that
situation,
and
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
rainier
view
decision
was
on
the
books,
this
court
had
denied
certiorari,
the
program
had
to
function
effectively
as
a
nationwide
program,
and
it
was
now
subject
to
disparate
standards,
congress
enacted
section
801
as
a
mechanism
to
restore
the
basis
for
adjusting
rents
going
forward
and
to
try
to
rectify
the
problems
it
had
identified
going
backward.
now,
retroactively,
what
congress
did
was
to
raise
the
rents
of
the
section
8
project
owners
who
had
been
limited
by
comparability
studies
or
who
had
not
actually
requested
rental
adjustments
because
they
feared
that
they
would
get
negative
adjustments
through
comparability
studies,
and
hud
said
that
as
to...
congress
said
that
as
to
those
owners,
the
full
factor
shall
be
applied
to
increase
their
rents,
but
only
to
the
portion
of
the
rents
not
used
for
debt
services.
so
congress
determined
to
adjust
their
rents
upward
to
the
extent
that
those
rents
were
affected
by
operating
cost
increases,
but
not
to
the
extent
that
they
were
used
to
cover
debt
service,
which
of
course
hadn't
gone
up
during
that
period.
they
may
well
have
gone
down,
since
refinancing
is
an
option.
congress
also
provided
a
floor
of
30
percent
of
the
full
factor
adjustment
to
make
sure
that
no
project
owner
was
really
left
with
just
a
nominal
supplementary
payment,
and
again,
congress
did
that
as
a
means
of
rectifying
what
it
perceived
as
well-founded
criticisms
of
the
comparability
process,
yet
at
the
same
time,
congress
was
unwilling
to
sanction
a
full
windfall
adjustment
factor
as
the
owners
saw
it.
simultaneously,
congress
decided
to
reform
the
program
going
forward
on
a
prospective
basis
by
requiring
hud
to
do,
in
essence,
as
the
first
level
response
to
rent
problems,
rent
adjustment
problems,
to
do
what
the
ninth
circuit
said...
adjust
the
factors
if
you
can,
construct
a
modified
adjustment
factor
based
on
a
smaller
market
area
than
the
large,
original
going-in
adjustment
factor,
and
use
comparability
studies
to
achieve
that
result,
and
that
surely
is
not
an
impairment
of
the
contract
right
even
as
respondents
claim
it,
because
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
hud
was
supposed
to
do.
only
if
that
fails,
and
hud
determines
that
it
cannot
construct
a
modified
adjustment
factor,
or
even
if
it
does
so,
the
adjustment
factor
that
it
constructs
fails
to
achieve
the
goal
of
comparability,
hud
is
then
authorized
to
use
another
means
of
employing
comparability
studies
to
get
to
its
ultimate
objective.
at
most,
in
our
view,
that
is
a
tinkering
with
the
process
and
procedure
that
does
not
constitute
a
substantial
impairment,
because
it
leaves
the
owners'
financial
rights
intact
and
it
changes
only
the
way
that
a
comparability
study
can
be
used.
hud
always
had
the
right
to
conduct
a
comparability
study.
the
ninth
circuit
never
disagreed
with
that,
so
there's
no
additional
procedural
burden
put
upon
the
owners
by
having
to
be
involved
in
a
comparability
study.
the
only
question
is
whether
hud
can
properly
use
that
study
as
a
second-level
response
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
factors
are
achieving
the
goal
of
comparability.
the
final
issue
in
this
case
arises
only
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
there
is
a
contract
right
and
a
substantial
impairment
of
that
right,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether,
notwithstanding
those
two
findings,
both
of
which
we
would
disagree
with,
the
impairment
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
its
invalidation
under
the
due
process
clause.
this
court
has
not,
since
the
1930's,
invalidated
a
federal
law
on
the
ground
that
it
had
impaired
contract
rights
between
the
government
and
a
private
party
under
the
due
process
clause,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
not
an
occasion
on
which
that
very
strong
medicine
is
warranted.
the
section
8
program
is,
at
its
base,
designed
to
use
public
funds
in
order
to
provide
low-income
housing
through
the
mechanism
of
private
owners
providing
the
housing
and
receiving
subsidies
from
hud.
two
features
of
this
program
are
critical.
the
first
is
that
owners
are
to
get
rent
adjustments
each
year
in
order
to
accommodate
changes
in
the
market,
and
the
second
feature
is
that
the
system
was
never
designed
to
give
the
owners
above-market
rents
that
would
reward
them
for
in
effect
not
being
as
efficient
as
the
private
sector
in
providing
the
housing,
again
subject
to
the
condition
that
initial
differences
in
the
setting
of
the
rents
would
not
be
abolished.
now,
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
upset
the
statutory
scheme
in
two
distinct
ways,
and
we've
discuss
them
both.
the
first
is
that
it
made
it
impossible
to
have
a
nationwide,
uniform
system
for
adjusting
rents.
neither
congress
nor
hud
was
willing
to
acquiesce
in
what
it
believed
was
a
wrong
decision
and
bad
public
policy,
and
therefore
neither
congress
nor
hud
wanted
to
extend
the
rainier
view
approach
to
the
entire
nation,
so
you
had
a
result
of
a
nationwide
system
that
was
no
longer
functioning
under
uniform,
sound
criteria.
and
the
second
feature
of
the
legal
terrain
that
congress
objected
to
was
that,
even
where
factor-based
increases
could
not
achieve
the
goal
that
congress
had
set
for
them...
namely,
providing
fair,
reasonable
increases
each
year
that
were
not
in
excess
of
comparable
rents...
hud
would
have
been
required
to
grant
such
increases,
and
those
results
were
simply
unacceptable
in
the
context
of
a
social
welfare
program
that
had
the
purpose
of
providing
subsidized
housing
for
low-income
tenants,
not
to
give
windfalls
to
their
landlords,
and
section
801
responded
to
the
situation
to
put
the
program
back
on
track.
it
restored
uniformity
to
the
program's
operation,
and
as
we've
discussed
it
did
that
in
large
measure
by
accepting
the
owners'
complaints
about
the
way
in
which
comparability
studies
were
conducted,
and
it
required
hud
to
put
out
regulations
that
would
rectify
prior
deficiencies,
and
it
also
reinstated
and
made
applicable
retroactively
the
market
rent
premise
of
the
program
so
that
owners
would
not
be
the
beneficiaries
of
hud's
mistake...
hud's
failure
to
recalibrate
the
factors
to
the
local
submarkets
in
light
of
comparability,
a
mistake
that
would
not
have
been
appreciated
before
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling,
and
hud
did
not
appreciate.
in
our
view,
those
purposes
are
legitimate
and
substantial
and,
in
light
of
the
relatively
modest
impairments
that
could
be
said
to
occur
in
this
case,
the
rent
adjustment
mechanisms
of
section
801
do
not
infringe
the
due
process
owners'
rights
and
the
constitutionality
of
section
801
should
be
upheld.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia,
we
don't,
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
the
case...
the
united
states
v.
seckinger,
from
which
that
test
is
drawn,
requires
that
the
alternative
readings
both
be
reasonable
and
practicable
as
well
as
finding
the
existence
of
an
ambiguity
in
the
contract,
and
in
our
view
it
would
not
be
a
reasonable
and
practicable
alternative
to
require
hud
to
adjust
the
adjustment
factors
in
light
of
comparability
studies
if
in
fact
adequate
data
does
not
exist
to
allow
hud
to
do
that,
and
the
result
would
be
the
contradiction
of
the
statutory
mandate
of
comparability.
so
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
that
the
bare
bones
of
that
particular
canon
are
satisfied,
even
assuming
ambiguity,
which
we
disagree
with.
the
second
reason
is
that
this
is
not
simply
a
naked
commercial
contract
in
which
the
government
went
out
to
purchase
widgets.
it
is
a
contract
that's
enacted
against
the
background
of
a
regulatory
scheme.
in
large
measure,
the
contracts
parallel
the
statutory
language,
the
statutes
have
been
implemented
through
regulations,
the
owners
knew
that
this
was
a
program
administered
by
an
administrative
agency,
and
in
the
comparable
case
of
united
states
v.
fulton,
this
court
gave
deference
first
to
the
agency's
construction
of
the
statute,
and
then
it
applied
the
same
meaning
to
identical
language
that
was
incorporated
into
a
contract.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
chevron
doesn't
apply
to
the
contract,
chevron--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
when
the
agency
used
identical
language
in
the
contract
that
had
been
used
in
the
statute,
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
statute
becomes
relevant,
otherwise
you
could
have
a
dysjunction
between
the
same
language
when
contained
in
the
contract
document
and
the
regulations.
in
one
case
you'd
apply
the
agency's
construction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree,
and
in
this
case
i
think
the
agency
has
been
careful
and
has
made
it
unambiguous,
but
the
other
principle
that
applies
here
is
that
a
party
that
seeks
to
apply
a
right
against
the
government
and
to
foreclose
the
exercise
of
the
government's
power
to
make
sure
that
its
programs
are
working
right
should
also
get
unambiguous
language
in
its
favor,
and
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
did
the
owners
get
an
unambiguous
right
to
above-market
rents
when
the
comparability
studies
show
that
the
factors
just
aren't
working
in
that
particular
case.
if
i
can--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--fulton
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
at--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--page
5.
it's
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
will
waive
rebuttal.
