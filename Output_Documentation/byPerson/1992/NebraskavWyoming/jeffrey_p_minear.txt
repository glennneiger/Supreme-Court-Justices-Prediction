mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
special
master
has
recommended
a
proper
disposition
of
the
pending
motions
for
summary
judgment.
he
has
skillfully
articulated
the
issues
in
this
complicated,
ongoing
case,
and
i
would
like
to
address
those
issues
in
the
same
order
that
he
chose.
i
turn
first
to
the
master's
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
inland
lakes
which
directly
affects
the
united
states'
responsibilities
under
the
reclamation
laws.
the
master
has
correctly
concluded
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
is
entitled
to
continue
its
80-year-old
practice
of
diverting
water
to
the
inland
lakes
during
the
nonirrigation
season
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
north
platte
project.
wyoming's
challenge
to
that
practice
is
flawed
in
four
fundamental
respects.
first,
the
bureau
does
have
a
state
water
permit
with
a
1904
priority
date
to
divert
water
for
the
north
platte
project.
the
inland
lakes
are
an
essential
component
of
the
north
platte
project
and
are
therefore
embraced
within
that
permit.
second,
the
inland
lake
diversions
that
are
at
issue
here
have
occurred
continuously
since
the
commencement
of
the
north
platte
project
operations
in
1913.
if
wyoming
truly
believed
that
the
federal
government's
diversions
were
unlawful,
it
should
have
raised
its
objections
at
that
time,
or
at
the
latest,
at
the
outset
of
the
proceedings
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right,
but
even
to
the
extent--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
they
might
contest
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--why,
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
pass
over
it
too
quickly.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
when
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--when
the
project--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
and
the
project
that
was...
the
permit
that
was
filed
in
1904,
of
course,
was
describing
the
project
in
very
general
terms
because
it
had
not
yet
been
built,
but
when
it
did
go
into
operation
in
1913,
the
canals
had
been
sized,
and
these
off-canal
reservoirs,
the
inland
lakes,
were
being
used.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
were
constructed
between
1904
and
1913.
now,
if...
as
i
said--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--they'd
be
covered
by
the
permit...
yes.
yes,
in
fact
the
special
master
notes
that
at
page
25
of
his
report.
in
1934,
the
engineer
for
the
state
of
wyoming
did
note
that
if
the
inland
lakes
are
a
part
of
the
project,
then
in
fact
they
would
be
covered
by
that
permit.
now,
the
third
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
with
respect
to
this
is
that
the
bureau's
inland
lakes
diversions
were
specifically
considered
in
the
1934
proceedings,
and
are,
in
the
special
master's
words,
a
vital
underpinning
of
the
apportionment
that
was
ultimately
made.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
indeed,
wyoming
itself
specifically
urged
that
the
bureau's
winter
diversions
to
the
inland
lakes
be
taken
into
account
by
the
special
master
in
order
to
reduce
nebraska's
apportionment
during
the
irrigation
season.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
decree
does
not
mention
a
good
number
of
things.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
all
the
decree
does
is
implement
the
court's
decision.
the
court's
decision
in
1945
is
long
and
complex,
and
it's
an
extraordinary
matter,
as
mr.
cook
has
stated,
to
enjoin
a
state.
the
decree
only
imposed
injunctions
where
it
felt
it
was
necessary
to
do
so.
nevertheless,
the
decree
is
founded
upon
those
assumptions
and
those
decisions
that
are
contained
in
the
court's
decision,
and
an
important
part
of
those
decisions
was
this
wintertime
diversion
to
the
inland
lakes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
it
certainly
does
not
expressly
exclude
it,
and
article
iv
of
the
decree
does
something
quite
different.
all
article
iv
of
the
decree
is
concerned
with
doing
is
determining
the
relationship
between
certain
senior
nebraska
canals,
so-called
state
line
canals
and
the
french
canal,
and
the
irrigation
reservoirs
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
and
what
paragraph
iv
essentially
says
is
you
have
to
fill...
you
have
to
supply
water
to
these
canals
at
a
certain
rate
before
you
can
begin
to
fill
the
reservoirs.
now,
it's
not
clear
from
reading
the
decree
that
that's
what
it
does.
you
have
to
go
back
and
read
the
opinion
again
to
understand
this,
but
that
is
the
actual
operational
purpose
of
the
decree.
now,
the
fourth
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
as
the
special
master
recognized,
the
result
wyoming
advocates
here
will
impair
the
bureau's
ability
to
fulfill
its
water
delivery
contracts
and
will
upset
settled
expectations
on
the
north
platte
river.
this
manner
of
operation
has
been
in
effect
for
a
long,
long
time.
likewise,
our
temporary
storage
in
guernsey
and
glendo
to
effectuate
this
apportionment
has
been
in
place
for
a
good
number
of
years
as
well,
and
that
is
simply
an
operational
practice
of
the
bureau,
and
i
think
it's
beyond
challenge
by
wyoming.
now,
the
special
master
also
refused
to
grant
summary
judgment
on
three
other
issues
on
this
case,
concluding
that
the
issues
were
not
yet
ripe
for
resolution,
or
that
they
involved
disputed
issues
of
material
fact.
the
special
master's
recommendations
on
those
interlocutory
matters
should
be
respected,
particularly
in
light
of
his
familiarity
with
the
record
of
this
case,
a
record
that
is
still
being
developed.
specifically,
the
special
master
correctly
recommended
that
this
court
should
deny
summary
judgment
motions
with
respect
to
the
laramie
river's
contributions
to
the
north
platte.
there
are
two
critical
considerations
with
respect
to
this
matter.
first,
wyoming's
argument
that
this
matter
is
controlled
by
the
laramie
decree
is
untenable,
because
that
decree
only
apportions
flow
down
to
the
wheatland
project
on
the
laramie
river.
post-wheatland
accretions
continue
to
flow
into
the
north
platte
river,
so
that
decree
does
not
control
matters.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
now,
that
decree,
of
course,
was
entered
simply
by
consent
between
colorado
and
wyoming,
and
the
provision
of
the
decree
that
applies
here
talks
about
the
decree
heretofore
entered.
the
1945
decree,
of
course--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
believe
it
said,
just
in
general
terms,
that
all
the
water
is
divided
between
those
two
states,
but
that
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
1945.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
think
it
said
it
in
quite
that
broad
of
terms.
it
was
a
rather
general
statement,
and
i
think
it
consisted--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
don't
have
the
exact
words
before
me,
but
i
think
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
read
to
state
that
this
is
conditioned
upon
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--nebraska
was
not
part
to
that
case,
and
what's
more,
when
this
court
in
1945
apportioned
the
north
platte,
it
included
those
laramie
inflows...
the
post-wheatland
laramie
inflows
as
part
of
that
pool
of
water
between
whalen
and
tri-state
that's
divided
up
among
the
states,
and
again,
it
is
a
central
assumption
that
went
into
the
apportionment
in
this
case.
now,
special
master
olpin
correctly
concluded
that
since
the
north
platte
water
supply
that
this
court
apportioned
in
1945
is
composed
in
significant
part
of
laramie
contributions,
nebraska
has
a
right
to
seek
relief
for
depletions
of
those
flows.
wyoming
is
wrong
in
arguing--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
i
believe
that
it
could.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
enforcing
the
decree,
because
what
you're
really
doing...
you
have
to
remember,
what
we
have
here
is
the
north
platte
river
that
is...
the
decree
imposes
certain
injunctions
on
the
upper
reaches
and
then
apportions
a
flow
of
water,
75
percent
to
nebraska
and
25
percent
to
wyoming,
in
a
certain
pivotal
stretch
of
the
river.
now,
any
interference
with
water
flowing
into
that
critical
stretch
we
would
view
as
something
that
is
contrary
to
the
decree
and
is
a
proper
subject
of
an
enforcement
action,
and
that
is
why
we
view
this
as
a
proper
matter
in
this
proceeding
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
it
has.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
the
motion
that
is
currently
pending
before
this
court
is
a
motion
to
apportion
nonirrigation
season
flows.
now,
the
nonirrigation
season
flows
were
to
a
large
extent
not
divided
between
the
states.
they
go
into
storage
for
the
various
reservoirs.
the
united
states
believes
that
matter
should
not
be
held...
it
could
be
dismissed
without
prejudice,
for
example,
but
it
should
not
be
resolved
until
these
enforcement
matters
are
resolved
first.
what
this
case
is
basically
about
is
wyoming's
desire
to
change
the
delicate
balance
of
the
river
by
including
new,
upstream
diversions,
and
that
is
what
nebraska
is
complaining
about
here.
the
united
states
is,
of
course,
concerned
about
it,
because
it
affects
the
operation
of
our
projects.
we
have
contract
obligations
to
deliver
waters
to
senior
appropriators,
and
any
loss
in
water
supply
anywhere
in
the
river
will
affect
our
operations.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
specifically
discuss
the
deer
creek
issue.
the
special
master
acted
appropriately
in
rejecting
wyoming's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
deer
creek
issues
based
on
three
crucial
factors.
first,
paragraph
xiii
of
the
decree
allows
nebraska
to
seek
relief
based
on
the
downstream
effects
of
tributary
storage
developments,
including
the
proposed
deer
creek
project.
now,
nebraska
has
put
forward
substantial
evidence
showing
such
effects,
and
there
is
therefore
a
material
issue
of
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
like
nebraska,
we're
troubled
by
this
interim
interpretation,
but
it
is
interim
at
this
point.
we
believe
that
the
special
master
should
be
free
to
reconsider
this
issue
once
he
has
actually
developed
the
facts
with
regard
to
the
municipal-use
exception.
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
there
are
factual
issues
with
regard
to
the
municipal-use
exception
as
well.
this
project,
the
deer
creek
project,
although
it
ostensibly
is
providing
municipal
water,
none
of
the
water
it
provides
will
go
to
casper.
it's
actually
downstream
of
casper.
it's
actually
being
devised
to
provide
what
is
called
exchange
water.
now,
it's
not
clear
that
this
would
be
a
municipal
use,
and
i
think
before
we
interpret
the
scope
of
the
municipal-use
exception,
we
ought
to
determine
what
the
scope
of
the
underlying
project
might
be.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
that
also
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
certainly
we
think
that
the
united
states
would
not
object
to
giving
him
free
rein
to
reconsider
his
decision.
we
believe
he
has
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
would
not
object
to
you
saying
that
he
was
wrong.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
this
court
also,
though,
to
interpret
exactly
how
the
municipal-use
provision
should
apply
in
the
absence
of
a
concrete,
factual
situation
in
which
to
apply
it.
the
same--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
the
special
master
also
correctly
resolved
the
so-called
below
tri-state
issues.
as
you
have
heard,
wyoming
and
colorado
seek
to
preclude
nebraska
from
offering
evidence
concerning
injuries
downstream
of
the
tri-state
dam.
the
special
master
properly
concluded
that
he
should
not
enter
an
abstract
order
preventing
nebraska
from
presenting
its
evidence
as
to
this
matter
because
it
would
deny
him
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
nebraska's
legal
theory
in
the
context
of
specific
facts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
motion
here
is
more
akin
to
a
motion
in
limine,
where
in
fact
the...
wyoming
is
seeking
to
limit
the
amount
of
evidence
that
can
come
in
with
respect
to
certain
issues
that
might
be
controverted,
and
i
think
that
great
respect
should
be
given
to
the
special
master
in
his
role
in
determining
the
content
of
the
record
here
as
to
whether
or
not
those
additional
facts
do
need
to
be
available,
or
at
what
point
they
might
be
cut
off.
it
might
be
the
special
master
will
determine
at
a
later
point
that
no,
these
matters
are
irrelevant.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
part
of
the
difficulty
here
is
it's
not
completely
clear
what
wyoming
is
concerned
about
here
with
regard
to
this
evidence.
one
way
that
this
evidence
might
be
relevant
is
with
respect
to
the
deer
creek
issue.
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
question
under
paragraph
xiii
or
article
xiii
of
the
decree
as
to
the
effect
of
deer
creek,
one
issue
might
be,
well,
what
is
the
effect
on
the
people
below
tri-state?
for
instance,
suppose
this
water,
the
deer
creek,
actually
impairs
the
availability
of
those
return
flows
from
interstate
canal
that
mr.
simms
alluded
to?
the
water
goes
through
the
interstate
canal
and
irrigates
certain
lands
and
then
the
return
flows
are
then
used
to
irrigate
other
properties.
what
if
the
deer
creek
project
affects
those
return
flows?
is
that,
in
fact,
an
effect
that
should
be
considered
in
determining
appropriate
relief?
we
believe
it
might
be,
and
we
think
it's
important
for
that
reason
not
to
foreclose
the
entry
of
that
evidence
until
it's
quite
clear
exactly
what
the
context
of
that
evidence
will
be.
finally,
special
master
olpin
was
also
correct
in
rejecting
wyoming's
argument
that
special
master
doherty's
determination
of
canal
requirements
in
the
1934
proceedings
imposed
limits
on
the
water
that
could
be
diverted
to
the
various
canals.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
