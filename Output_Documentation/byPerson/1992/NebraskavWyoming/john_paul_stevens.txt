justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
he
say
that
issue
had
to
be
tried
in
any
event...
whether
it
came
within
the
exception
in
paragraph
x?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
who
has
the
burden
of
proving
whether
or
not
the
water
would
be
within
the
usual
domestic
municipal
and
so
forth
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
he
saying
that
you
have
to
put
in
proof
on
that
issue,
so
therefore
he
can't
decide
on
summary
judgment?
maybe
i
misunderstood
something.
