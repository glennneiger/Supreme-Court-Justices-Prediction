chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
108
original,
the
state
of
nebraska
v.
the
states
of
wyoming
and
colorado.
mr.
cook,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cook,
do
you
plan
to
go
through
the
various
points
seriatim?
either...
as
you
say,
the
case
does
perhaps
appear
somewhat
complicated,
and
i
at
any
rate
would
be
helped
if...
the
first
one
is
the
inland
lakes,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
just
whatever
order
you
want,
but
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
devote
a
little
bit
of
attention
to
each
one
of
the
issues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
master's
alternate
ground
for
granting
summary
judgment
for
nebraska
on
the
inland
lakes
i
think
was
that
there
had
been
a
longstanding
acquiescence
by
wyoming.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cook.
mr.
norton,
we'll
hear
from
you...
or,
i'm
sorry,
ms.
norton.
g-a-l-e
can
be
either
a
man's
or
a
woman's
name.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
norton.
mr.
simms,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
simms.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
were
the
inland
lakes
constructed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
1934
proceedings
being
those
which
led
to
the
1945
decree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--could
it
seek
relief
in
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
that
amount
to
an
amendment,
or
is
it
just
something
at
the
foot
of
the
decree?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that's
really
the
purpose
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
is
to
prevent
the
admission
of
a
lot
of
extraneous
evidence
if,
in
fact,
it
wouldn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
legal
outcome.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
cook,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cook.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
