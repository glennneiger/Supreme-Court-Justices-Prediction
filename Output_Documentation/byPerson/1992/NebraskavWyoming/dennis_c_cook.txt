mr.
dennis
c.
cook
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
today
on
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
recommendations
on
cross
motions
for
partial
summary
judgment
in
an
original
action
this
court
accepted
in
1987.
it
was
filed
in
1986.
what
makes
this
case
important
to
more
than
the
parties
before
you
here
today
is
that
these
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
provide
the
opportunity
for
the
court
to
demonstrate
the
proper
application
of
summary
judgment
as
a
procedural
tool
to
secure
a
just,
speedy,
and
inexpensive
determination
of
this
original
case.
to
follow
the
special
master's
recommendations
here
will
be
to
accept
a
view
of
summary
judgment
that
is
incompatible
with
the
court's
decision
in
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
celotex
v.
catrett,
and
national
wildlife
federation
v.
lujan.
the
special
master
in
this
case
indicates
at
the
outset
of
his
second
interim
report
that
he
has
followed
the
court's
dictates
with
regard
to
the
summary
judgment
decisions,
but
i
would
submit
that
he
hasn't,
and
the
clear
example
that
makes
the
case
is
in
his
resolution
of
the
below
tri-state
issue,
where
the
special
master
says:
the
specific
issue
to
be
addressed
at
this
point
is
the
appropriateness
of
ruling
on
whether
nebraska's
as-yet-unseen
evidence
of
injury
or
threatened
injury
to
her
interest
downstream
of
tri-state
will
be
material
to
whether
wyoming
or
colorado
has
violated
nebraska's
apportionment.
at
this
stage,
however,
it
is
premature
to
enter
an
order
advising
nebraska
how
she
may
develop
her
case
and
the
provisions
for
which
her
evidence
will
be
deemed
material.
reading
the
court's
summary
judgment
decisions,
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
a
fair
reading
of
those
decisions
that
would
allow
this
recommendation
not
to
decide,
but
to
allow
nebraska
more
time
yet
to
determine
if
it
has
a
case,
to
grope
along
for
another
6
years,
possibly,
to
determine
if
it
has
a
case.
that's
the
heart
of
our
issue.
nebraska
has
brought
a
petition
that
alleges
four
specific
violations
of
the
north
platte
decree.
wyoming
has
admitted
in
our
answer...
we
have
admitted
the
four
specific
actions,
but
denied
that
they
violate
the
decree.
then
by
way
of
summary
judgment
motions,
wyoming
asks
the
logical
and
unavoidable
legal
question
of
whether
those
four
specific
acts
do
in
fact
violate
the
decree.
despite
what...
as
complicated
as
this
case
may
appear
from
time
to
time,
that
legal
question
is
not
complicated.
it
involves
simply
reading
the
north
platte
decree
and
determining
with
respect
to
each
of
the
four
issues
whether
there's
a
violation
of
the
decree.
the
decree
was
final
in
1945,
it
is
a
clear
and
unambiguous
statement
of
what
injunctions
were
imposed
against
colorado
and
wyoming
and
nebraska,
and
it
does
not
require
a
trial
or
further
evidence
to
at
least
interpret
that
decree.
the
analysis
of
all
of
the
four
specific
acts
follows
the
same
basic
course
of
reasoning.
first,
the
court
must
look
at
the
act
and
determine
within
the
language
of
the
decree
whether
in
fact
that
specific
act
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
decree.
then,
if
it
isn't
a
violation
of
one
of
the
existing
injunctions
against
wyoming,
then
wyoming
is
entitled
to
a
summary
judgment
on
that
pure
question
of
law.
before
going
further
with
any
one
of
those
specific
acts
to
determine
if
this
court
should
exercise
its
extraordinary
power
to
enjoin
the
state
of
wyoming
to
prohibit
an
act,
the
court
then
has
to
ask
the
question,
has
it
been
asked
to
amend
the
decree
by
nebraska,
has
the
court
agreed
to
consider
such
an
amendment
of
the
decree
and
then,
if
both
of
those
tests
have
been
met,
now,
on
summary
judgment,
when
wyoming
moves
to
pierce
their
pleadings,
has
nebraska
come
forward
with
evidence
that
would
support
a
finding
in
their
favor,
and
that
evidence
would
have
to
support
a
finding
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
an
injunction
is
necessary
to
protect
some
vital
interest
of
the
state
of
nebraska
under
the
existing
decree.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that's
one
issue,
and
i
can
get
to
that
right
away.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
right.
your
honor,
let
me
turn
to
the
inland
lakes,
at
your
suggestion,
and
suggest
that
wyoming
is
entitled
to
a
ruling
in
its
favor
on
summary
judgment,
and
our
initial
summary
judgment
motion
was
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
degree
for
wyoming
not
to
recognize
an
interstate
water
right
for
the
inland
lakes.
the
point
that
we
would
make
is
that
there
is
no
interstate
water
right
in
the
decree,
your
honor.
the
supreme
court
in
1945...
and
i
would
turn
to
paragraph
iv
of
the
decree.
that's
found
at
appendix
a-4
of
our
brief...
knew
how
to
specify
an
interstate
water
right.
the
entire
north
platte
case
that
spanned
11
years
from
1934
to
1945
was
about
a
request
to
enforce
interstate
water
rights.
that
was
to
have
the
state
of
wyoming
and
the
state
of
wyoming...
or,
state
of
wyoming,
pardon
me,
and
the
state
of
colorado
forced
by
this
court
to
exercise
their
police
power
against
valid
rights
in
those
states
for
the
benefit
of
a
right
in
nebraska.
no
one
asked
for
an
interstate
water
right
for
the
inland
lakes,
and
when
you
look
at
paragraph
iv,
where
there's
very
careful
specification
of
the
interstate
water
right
for
five
specific
canals,
where
wyoming
was
required
to
exercise
its
police
power
to
prohibit
the...
or
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
valid
wyoming
water
rights
for
the
benefit
of
these
nebraska
rights,
the
court
was
clear.
they
did
not
issue
a
water
right
then
for
the
inland
lakes.
they
were
not
asked
to
issue
one,
and
there
was
no
predicate
state
water
right
for
which
they
could
base
one.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that
is
his
basis,
or
one
basis.
we
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
what
has
occurred
over
time
is
that
the
inland
lakes
have
stored
water
from
the
north
platte
river,
but
since
1913,
the
record
that
we've
supplied
through
our
affidavits
on
summary
judgment
is
that
wyoming
has
put
the
united
states
on
notice
since
1913
that
they
had
no
valid
water
right,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
took
water,
they
had
no
right
to
expect
priority
administration.
they
were
taking
free
river
water
at
their
peril.
in
other
words,
they
can
continue
to
do
that,
and
we
will
allow
that
practice
to
continue
now,
but
the
problem
is,
is
the
special
master
would
recommend
that
a
1904
priority
be
imposed
that
works
a
mischief
on
many
wyoming
water
rights
obtained
according
to
wyoming
water
law,
including
the
cities
of
casper
and
most
of
the
major
users
on
the
north
platte.
further,
i
would
just
suggest
that
because
it's
not
in
the
decree,
that
resolves
the
issue
completely,
and
there
is
no
interstate
water
right.
should
the
court
consider
whether
they
would
like
to
amend
the
decree,
that
becomes,
then,
a
question
of
fact,
whether
that
amendment
is
necessary
to
protect
those
interests
in
nebraska
that
are
protected
by
the
decree,
and
the
decree
clearly
protects
irrigation
water
rights
that
divert
between
whalen
and
tri-state
diversion
dam,
nothing
else...
nothing
further
downstream.
if
i
might,
your
honor,
i'll
turn
to
the
deer
creek
issue,
to
give
some
thought
to
that.
on
the
deer
creek
project,
clearly
even
the
special
master
agrees
that
there
is
no
current
restriction
that
prohibits
wyoming
from
constructing
the
deer
creek
project.
the
issue
becomes
whether
the
court
has
agreed
to
accept
an
amendment
of
the
decree,
and
hear
a
case
to
amend
the
decree
to
prohibit
wyoming
from
constructing
the
deer
creek
project.
whether
the
courts
accepted
it,
or
whether
the
state
of
nebraska
made
the
proper
threshold
showing
allowing
them
to
get
into
court
on
that
separate
issue,
becomes
irrelevant
when
you
look
at
the
fact
that
now
it
apparently
is
here
in
front
of
the
special
master
on
summary
judgment
nebraska
has
come
forward
with
no
facts
that
under
your
cases
on
summary
judgment
would
support
them
prevailing
at
trial
if
that
was
the
only
evidence
presented.
special
master
olpin
in
this
case
narrowed
the
issue
down
to
the
record
of
two
specific
affidavits
of
mr.
lee
becker,
an
expert
employed
by
the
state
of
nebraska,
former
nebraska
state
hydrologist,
and
those
two...
i'd
point
the
court's
attention
to
that
in
their
consideration
of
this
case
to
review
those
two
affidavits
and
determine
if
they
could
enter
judgment
on
behalf
of
nebraska
based
on
that.
mr.
becker
specifically
told...
in
his
march
1
affidavit
indicated
that,
after
analyzing
the
deer
creek
project,
its
effect
on
the
north
platte
river,
he
even
analyzed
the
impact
of
a
junior
water
right
on
the
inland
lakes,
and
he
analyzed
the
impact
of
no
flows
from
the
laramie
reaching
the
north
platte,
he
concluded
that
historic
diversions
from
whalen
to
tri-state
diversion
dam
can
be
met
in
all
scenarios
described.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
oh...
no,
he
hasn't
judged
against
us,
but
the
problem,
your
honor,
is...
and
the
purpose
of
summary
judgment
is,
if
there's
no
proof
at
this
point,
6
years
into
this
case,
no
affidavits
when
two
separate
motions
for
summary
judgment
have
challenged
nebraska
to
come
forward
with
a
reason
for
trial,
then
why
should
we
go
through
the
considerable
expense
of
trying
an
issue
that...
there's
nothing
there?
the
issue--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--pardon
me.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
your
honor,
there's
no
debate
about
that.
to
build
a
project,
if
it
doesn't
deplete
the
stream,
there's
no
point
in
building
it.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
no,
no,
no.
we
freely
admit
that
it
will
deplete
the
system
10,000
acre-feet
per
year
on
average.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
well,
he
submits
that
there's
indication
to
him
based
on
those
affidavits
of
a
question
of
fact
that
those
canals
in
that
whalen
to
tri-state
reach
will
be
affected.
mr.
becker's
affidavits
indicate
that
he
does
not
conclude
that.
he
had
a
second
affidavit
that
said,
i
still
agree
with
my
first
conclusion.
when
we
pointed
this
out
and
said
it
looks
to
me
like
you've
lost
your
case,
they
came
up
with
a
second
affidavit
and
he
said,
i
agree
with
my
conclusion,
but
i
also
recognize
that
there
are
other
analysis
of
this
deer
creek
project
that
would
indicate
that
the
effect
of
deer
creek
would
be
on
government
storage
projects
in
wyoming,
and
then,
in
a
series
of
dry
years,
that
could
affect.
the
point
is
that
could
affect
doesn't
tell
us
anything.
he
doesn't
agree
with
that.
he
doesn't
like
that
analysis,
and
he
has
submitted
to
the...
he's
committed
to
the
other.
we
also
have
a
record
that
shows
that
nebraska
takes
more
than
40,000
acre-feet
per
year
in
excess
of
the
requirements
determined
by
this
court
in
1945
as
what
it
was
protecting,
so
we
have
nebraska
taking
in
excess
of
40,000
acre-feet
per
year
more
than
their
requirements
at
the
same
time
they're
attacking
the
construction
of
a
10,000
acre
foot
per
year
project
for
municipal
use
in
wyoming.
i
think
that
summary
judgment
resolves
this
issue
in
paragraph
xiii,
and
the
court
need
go
no
further.
if
it
does
go
further,
then
there's
the
paragraph
x
question
of
municipal
use
and
the
exemption
under
paragraph
x,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
he
has,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
so.
we
don't
think
there's
even
been
a
question
of
fact
presented
about
whether
the
municipal
use
that
would
be
made
of
water
stored
in
deer
creek
is
not
the
same
municipal
use
that
would
be
used
in
nebraska
or
colorado,
and
we
don't
see
the
affidavits
that
show
contrary
to
that,
but
we
think
that
paragraph
x
need
not
be
reached,
but
we
also
think
paragraph
x
is
an
absolute
exemption.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
in
the
case
that
it
would
be
questioned,
it
would
be
the
state
of
wyoming,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
well,
he...
there
has
to
be
a
controversy.
we've
said
there's
no
problem
with
deer
creek,
so
then
it
becomes
incumbent
upon
our
opponent
to
come
forward
with
proof
why...
where
we're
wrong
and
what
would
entitle
him
to
an
injunction
preventing
the
deer
creek
project.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
yes.
that's
a
correct
analysis.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
no,
i
don't,
and
no,
he
didn't,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
and
that's
the
position
that
we
take
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
but
that's
how
we
understand
it,
and
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
our
statement
of
the
record
as
far
as
deer
creek,
and
on
summary
judgment,
we're
confident
that
that
record
will
sustain
our
view.
on
the
laramie
river
issue,
the
clear
evidence
is,
and
what
happened
in
the
past
was
that
nebraska
and...
nebraska
said
in
1945,
you
can't
prevent
us
from
looking
and
seeking
an
apportionment
of
the
laramie
river
because
we
weren't
a
party
to
the
debate
between
colorado
and
wyoming
over
its
use.
the
court
agreed
with
nebraska,
gave
them
their
day
in
court,
and
in
the
end
said,
you're
not
entitled
to
an
apportionment
of
the
laramie
river.
the
special
master
in
this
case
agrees
that
they
have
no
specific
apportionment
of
the
laramie
river.
he
agrees
that
there's
no
restriction
on
wyoming's
use--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--well,
he
suggests
that,
your
honor,
but
if
there's
no
restriction
on
wyoming's
use,
and
no
apportionment
to
nebraska,
then
the
trigger
needs
to
be
pulled
and
say
there's
no
violation
of
the
decree
by
those
proposed
uses.
then
nebraska
has--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--until
nebraska
obtains
an
apportionment,
and
we
suggest
that
if
they
try
to
do
that
they
will
be
relitigating
a
factual
matter
that's
already
been
put
to
rest
in
this
case.
on
the
estoppel
argument
with
regard
to
the
inland
lakes
issue,
i
just
want
to
make
the
point--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--well,
that's
our...
the
laramie
river
issues
are
not
the
deer
creek
issue,
your
honor.
laramie
involves--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--deer
creek
is
on
a
separate
tributary
that's
apart
from
the
laramie
river.
the
two--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--what
i
would
suggest
is
the
two--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--the
two
projects,
corn
creek
and
grayrocks,
are
on
the
laramie
river,
your
honor,
and
they--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--they
are
no
longer
an
issue
in
this
case
if
there's
no
apportionment.
the
united
states'
estoppel
argument
on
the
inland
lakes
makes
a
clear
admission
that
that
issue
was
not
decided
in
1945.
thank
you,
your
honor.
