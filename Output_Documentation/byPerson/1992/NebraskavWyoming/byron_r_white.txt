justice
byron
r.
white
i
can't
understand
the
master's
finding.
he
refused
to
enter
summary
judgment
for
wyoming,
but
he
said
that
this...
the
deer
creek
thing
had
to
be
tried,
so
it
wasn't
as
if
he
entered
summary
judgment
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know
you
don't
agree
with
the
special
master,
but
the
master...
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
deer
creek
project
if
carried
out
would
lessen
the
mainstream
flow
of
the
north
platte.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
and
what
if
he...
and
if
he's
right
about
that...
of
course,
you
claimed
that
it
wouldn't,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
did
the
master
think
that
there
should
be
a
trial,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
--involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
on
the
platte
and
the
laramie,
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
nebraska
be
injured
by
the
deer
creek
project?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
immediate
effect
is
to
take
water
out
of
the
mainstream
of
deer
creek.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
effect
of
deer
creek
is
that
it
would
deplete...
take
water
out
of
the
mainstream
of
the
north
platte.
it
would
divert
water
from
the
mainstream
and
store
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
does
that
hurt
nebraska,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
it
do
that?
how
would
it
reduce
the
storage
upstream?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
1945.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
your
first
argument
is
that
even
if
it
had
raised
it,
whenever,
they
should
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--don't
pass
over
so
quickly
what
you
say
is
an
inviolable
right
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
to
put
into
this
canal
the
nonirrigation
system
flows.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
pretty
quickly.
you
just
say
it
was
just
a
part
of
the...
the
reason
is
that
that
kind
of
a
flow
in
the
canal
was
part
of
the
project.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
which,
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
which
they
had
a
permit
from
wyoming.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
wyoming
ever
say
that
if
the
inland
lakes
was
actually
part
of
the
project,
that
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
provision
in
the
1955...
was
it
'55
or
'57
laramie
river
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
what
did
the
1955
decree
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
that
mean?
did
the
two
states...
the
decree
did
say
that...
did
it
say
that
all
the
water
flowing
in
the
laramie
river
belonged
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
states?
is
that
what
it
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
or...
you
would
object
to
our
saying
that
he
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
has
this
issue
got
to
do
with
the
claims
that
nebraska
makes
that
wyoming
is
violating
the
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
thinks
the...
he
thinks
the
original
decree
contemplated
that
the
laramie
would
contribute
to
the
flow
of
the
north
platte.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
upstream
states...
wyoming
and
colorado...
are
entitled
to
any
of
the
water
that
is
flowing
in
the
laramie
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis,
the
deer
creek
issue
becomes
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
about
the
other
project
that--
