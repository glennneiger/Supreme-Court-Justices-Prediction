justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
state
water
law
in
wyoming
concerning
municipal
use
of
water.
wyoming's
a
prior
appropriation
water
law
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
an
irrigation
use
has
a
prior
date
than
municipal
use,
is
it
the
law
in
wyoming
that
then
the
municipal
user
would
have
to
condemn
and
pay
for
that
right
to
come
in
ahead.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you...
do
you
think
that
the
special
master
interpreted
paragraph
x
to
override
state
law
on
prior
appropriation
insofar
as
municipal
use
is
concerned
in
this
decree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
read
him
as
having
done
just
that.
i
thought
the
decree,
paragraph
x,
just
said
the
decree
won't
determine
this
issue.
we
leave
it
to
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
isn't
clear
that
that's
how
the
master
understood
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
you
take
the
position
that
yes,
municipal
uses
can
be
made
of
the
water
but
they're
chargeable
under
the
apportionment
formula,
i
take
it,
to
each
state...
to
the
state
that
takes
it.
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
decree
apportioned
waters
out
of,
let's
say,
the
laramie,
in
a
certain
percentage
to
each
state.
now,
if
wyoming
takes
water
that
was
apportioned
to
it
for
municipal...
it
takes
water
out
of
its
25
percent,
or
whatever
it
is,
and
uses
it
for
municipal
purposes,
does
that
still
count
toward
the
25
percent
that
was
apportioned
to
wyoming?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
you
think
the
early...
or,
decree
never
mentioned
them
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
nebraska's
filed
a
motion
to
amend,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
do
we
do
with
that,
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
master's
interpretation
of
paragraph
x
exemption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
of
these
is
nebraska
versus
wyoming.
it
is
an
original
action
concerning
interstate
water
rights
to
the
north
platte
river.
that
river
rises
is
in
colorado
and
flaws
northward
through
wyoming
and
to
nebraska.
in
1945,
this
court
entered
a
decree
establishing
certain
interstate
priorities
on
the
north
platte.
the
court
equitably
apportioned
between
wyoming
and
nebraska
the
waters
in
a
40-mile
stretch
known
as
the
"pivotal
reach".
in
1986,
nebraska
came
back
to
this
court
seeking
enforcement
of
that
1945
decree
and
seeking
injunctive
relief.
we
granted
nebraska
the
lead
to
file
its
petition.
wyoming
counterclaimed
colorado
and
the
united
states,
united
states
which
operates
several
reservoirs
and
canals
on
the
river
were
made
parties.
we
referred
the
matter
to
a
special
master,
master
owen
olpin
who
was
managed
the
litigations
since
1987.
and
before
us
now
are
the
special
master's
recommended
dispositions
of
several
summary
judgment
motions
together
with
the
exceptions
filed
to
the
special
master's
report.
for
reasons
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
the
special
master's
recommendations
and
we
overrule
the
exceptions
to
those
recommendations.
summary
judgment
is
granted
to
nebraska
and
the
united
states
on
the
question
of
the
priority
of
the
inland
lakes
in
nebraska.
we
agree
with
the
master
that
a
1904
priority
date
was
determined
in
the
1945
proceedings
and
that
wyoming's
post
decree
acquiescence
in
administration
of
the
lakes
precludes
that
from
challenging
that
priority
now.
neither
wyoming
nor
nebraska
is
entitled
to
summary
judgment
on
the
issues,
concerning
wyoming's
construction
of
new
storage
and
diversion
facilities
on
two
north
platte
tributaries,
deer
creek
and
the
laramie
river.
we
agree
with
the
master
that
further
proceedings
are
warranted.
because
the
court
did
not
establish
rights
to
the
disputed
tributary
waters
in
1945,
however,
we
note
that
injunctive
relief
would
constitute
a
modification
of
the
decree.
to
prevail
therefore,
nebraska
must
make
a
showing
that
the
new
projects
will
cause
nebraska's
substantial
injury.
finally,
we
deny
the
parties
request
for
several
rulings
with
respect
to
the
water
rights
of
users
below
the
tri-state
dam
in
nebraska.
most
of
these
issues
are
insufficiently
developed
to
lend
themselves
to
a
summary
judgment
at
this
time.
we
do,
however,
grant
nebraska
partial
summary
judgment
on
its
request
for
a
determination
that
the
1945
decree
does
not
impose
absolute
ceilings
on
the
amount
of
water
that
canals
in
the
pivotal
reach
may
divert.
the
court
is
uninamous.
