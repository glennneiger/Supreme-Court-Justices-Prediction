unknown
speaker
yes,
i
would
expect
you
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
master--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
nebraska
wasn't
a
party
to
that
case--
unknown
speaker
finally,
there's
the
question
of
how
deer
creek
will
be
administered.
if
deer
creek
is
administered
under
the
state
system
junior
to
all
the
senior
appropriators,
and
if
respect
is
made
for
nebraska's
apportionment,
then
it
might
well
be
that
the
municipal
use
here
will
have
no
real
effect
on
the
river.
the
important
point
at
this
juncture
is
that
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
would
be
premature.
the
special
master
should
be
left
free
to
reconsider
the
meaning
of
the
municipal-use
provision
in
a
concrete
fashion
when
he
applies
the
law
to
the
facts
established
at
trial.
should
we
suggest
that
he
ought
to
reconsider?
unknown
speaker
at
least
we
shouldn't
say
he's
right.
unknown
speaker
pardon
me.
where
is
the
deer
creek--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
about
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
those--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
the
twenty-fifth
at
ten
o'clock.
