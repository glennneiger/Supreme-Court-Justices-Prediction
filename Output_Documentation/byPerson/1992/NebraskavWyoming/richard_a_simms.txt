mr.
richard
a.
simms
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
colorado
has
just
described
to
you
the
so-called
tri-state
issues
solely
in
the
context
of
nebraska's
petition,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
they
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
nebraska's
petition.
they
relate
entirely
to
wyoming's
counterclaim,
which
is
not
before
you
on
exceptions.
with
respect
to
these
tri-state
issues,
it
is
imperative
that
you
know
what
wyoming
and
colorado
are
truly
after.
they
are
truly
not
seeking
to
define
the
apportionment,
as
they
have
told
you,
but
rather
to
preclude
the
presentation
of
evidence
underlying
one
of
nebraska's
principal
defenses
to
wyoming's
counterclaim.
when
the
equities
were
evaluated
in
1945
in
this
case,
one
of
the
factors
that
was
considered,
one
of
the
most
important
factors
that
was
considered
by
the
court,
was
return
flows.
that
is,
flows
that
go
from
upgradient
lands
after
the
primary
use
and
can
be
utilized
again
on
downgradient
lands.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
nebraska
conceded
that
she
needed
no
apportionment
of
direct
flows
east
of
bridgeport,
nebraska...
that's
about
60
miles
into
bridgeport...
but
she
still
maintained
that
she
needed
an
apportionment
of
direct
flows
for
the
lands
between
tri-state,
just
below
the
state
line,
and
bridgeport,
some
60
miles
in.
the...
master
doherty
found,
in
dealing
with
this
problem,
that
there
did
not
be
an
apportionment
of
direct
flows
because
the
canals
below
tri-state,
lying
below
tri-state
and
between
tri-state
and
bridgeport,
could
be
satisfied
by
return
flows,
and
what
he
did
was
to
stop
the
direct
apportionment
at
tri-state
with
the
understanding
that,
as
an
intrinsic
part
of
that
apportionment,
the
canals
below
tri-state
and
above
bridgeport
would
be
satisfied
by
the
return
flows.
there
are
ten
canals
in
that
area
now.
their
sole
source
of
supply...
that
is,
their
sole
source
of
natural
flow...
comes
from
those
return
flows.
there
are
no
tributaries
in
the
reach.
they
have
no
alternative
means
of
obtaining
water.
the
definition
that
the
state
of
wyoming
wants
from
the
court
is
this:
they
want
you
to
declare
that,
quote,
evidence
of
uses
supplied
by
diversions
below
tri-state
dam
is
immaterial
to
proof
of
nebraska's
apportionment
under
the
decree,
end
quote.
well,
wyoming's
purpose
in
seeking
that
definition
is
simply
to
enable
it
to
pursue
its
counterclaim
without
respecting
the
indirect
apportionment
to
the
canals
below
tri-state
and
above
bridgeport.
in
1945,
these
canals
were
called
the
optional
diverters.
now,
if
new
mexico...
or,
if
nebraska's
evidence
could
be
precluded,
eliminating
nebraska's
obligation
to
protect
parens
patriae
all
of
those
users
relying
on
return
flows,
wyoming
could
then
freely
pursue
her
counterclaim
to
attempt
to
force
on
the
primary
users
of
waters
diverted
at
tri-state
increased
efficiencies,
and
they
would
do
so
pursuant
to
the
court's
first
decision
in
1980,
i
believe,
in
colorado
v.
new
mexico.
without
going
through
the
numbers,
if
you
were
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
primary
users
by
15
percent,
you
would
reduce
the
return
flows
by
50
percent.
that
would
leave
the
ten
canals
in
that
stretch
without
the
source
of
water
that
was
provided
to
them
by
master
doherty.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
decree
apportioned
the
direct
flows
at
tri-state--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--for
lands
immediately
below
tri-state.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
did
so
recognizing...
explicitly
recognizing
that
returns
would
be
utilized
from
the
primary
diversion
for
the
downstream
canals.
that
was
an
intrinsic--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--part
of
the
apportionment.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
we...
nebraska
needs
to
be
able
to
protect
parens
patriae
all
of
the
users
of
waters
apportioned,
whether
for
direct
application
or
for
return
flow
application.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
what
it
proves
is
what
the
united
states
urged
upon
master
doherty
in
1945.
they
urged
this
alternative
for
these
optional
diverters
of
not
providing
them
with
a
direct
flow
apportionment
at
tri-state,
and
the
alternative
was,
we
can
provide
them
with
return
flows.
that
is
their
sole
source.
we
need
to
be
able
to
establish
that
as
a
factual
matter
in
order
to
protect
those
users
parens
patriae,
and
all
of
that
is
embraced
within
the
apportionment
in
paragraph
v.
i'd
like
to
get
on
to
the
deer
creek
matter.
with
respect
to
deer
creek,
the
special
master
left
open
the
possibility
of
avoiding
trial
in
giving
wyoming
an
unconstitu...
or,
an
unconditional
license
to
deplete
the
irrigation
apportionment
if
the
proposed
deer
creek
project
fell
within
master
olpin's
construction
of
paragraph
x.
paragraph
x
in
the
decree
states
that
the
decree
shall
not
affect
or
restrict
municipal
uses.
reading
an
affirmative
grant
into
paragraph
x,
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
that
paragraph,
mr.
olpin
has
construed
paragraph
x
as
giving
municipalities
a
right
to
deplete
the
flows
that
were
apportioned
for
irrigation.
instead
of
reading
paragraph
x
as
ensuring
that
the
apportionment
provisions
would
not
restrict
municipal
uses,
as
it
says
quite
plainly,
he
reads
paragraph
x
to
say
that
municipalities
can
restrict
the
apportionment.
what
he
has
done,
in
effect,
is
to
redefine
paragraph
x
to
infer
an
affirmative
right
as
a
result
of
the
paragraph's
elimination
of
restrictions.
doherty's...
master
doherty's
explanation
of
that
paragraph
in
1944
i
think
conclusively
establishes
that
master
olpin
is
wrong.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
m
not
certain
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
25
percent
went
only
to
the
irrigation
apportionment.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
paragraph
itself
plainly
said
and
was
meant
to
remove
any
possible
restriction
on
municipalities
by
the
operation
of
the
coercive
aspects
of
the
decree.
master
doherty,
when
he
made
his
recommendation
to
the
court
for
the
decree
provisions,
said,
and
i'm
quoting,
the
parties
are
agreed
that
there
should
be
no
restriction
upon
the
diversion
from
the
north
platte
river
in
colorado
or
wyoming
of
water
for
ordinary
and
usual
domestic
and
municipal
purposes
and
consumption.
nothing
in
the
injunctions
recommended
is
intended
to
or
will
interfere
with
such
uses,
diversions
and
uses,
end
quote.
by
reference
to
the
injunctions,
master
doherty
i
believe
was
explaining
what
was
meant
a
little
bit
more
specifically,
and
what
he
was
explaining
was
that
the
coercive
parts
of
the
decree
should
not
affect
municipalities.
he
was
not
indicating
in
the
slightest
manner
that
paragraph
x
somehow
gave
an
affirmative
right
to
deplete
the
apportionment
for
irrigation
purposes.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
nebraska
would
be
injured
in
three
different
areas.
the
proof
shows
that
it
would,
during
a
period
of
drought,
make
it
impossible
to
meet
requirements.
the
proof
also
shows
that
there
would
be
a
reduction
in
upstream
federal
reservoirs
in
large
sums.
the
proof
also
shows
that
deer
creek,
which
would
in
large
part
deplete
winter
flows,
would
adversely
interfere
with
the
inland
lakes,
and
the
proof
weighs
very
heavily...
very
heavily,
beyond
any
standard
that
might
be
imposed
under
celotex
or
liberty
lobby.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
pardon
me,
justice
white?
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
proposal
is
this.
the
city
of
casper
sits
upstream.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
downstream
are
senior
agricultural
users--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--who
could
call
out
casper.
casper
has
junior
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
entire
purpose
of
this
scheme
is
to
take
tributary
flows
in
an
intermediate
tributary,
deer
creek,
store
them
in
the
winter,
then
release
them
to
the
downstream
seniors
so
the
downstream
seniors
theoretically
would
not
call
out
the
city
of
casper.
even
as
to
its
alleged
municipal
component...
and
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
many
other
components
to
deer
creek,
but
even
as
to
its
alleged
municipal
component,
all
it
is
doing
is
providing
a
supplemental
supply
to
downstream
senior
irrigators
and
in
effect
changing
the
concept
of
priority
in
wyoming
contrary
to
paragraph
xii(a)
of
the
decree.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
hurts
nebraska
in
three
different
ways.
it
hurts
nebraska
in
terms
of
her
apportionment
at
tri-state,
it
hurts
nebraska
in
terms
of
her
right
to
have
the
inland
lakes
filled
with
nonirrigation
waters
during
the
winter,
it
also
injured
nebraska
in
that
the
yield...
if
the
yield
of
deer
creek
were
9,600
acre-feet
annually,
it
would
severely
reduce
the
amount
of
water...
carryover
storage
water
in
upstream
reservoirs,
so
there
are
three
ways
in
which
nebraska
would
be
hurt.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
would
do
that
by
virtue
of
the
way
in
which
the
water
in
the
different
reservoirs
accrued
to
accounts
as
opposed
to
physically
accruing
to
the
reservoirs,
and
it's
a
very
complicated
explanation,
but
nevertheless
the
evidence,
both
of
the
united
states
and
nebraska's
evidence,
establishes
that
beyond
a
doubt.
with
respect
to
the
laramie
river,
the
question
may
simply
be
one
of
semantics.
we...
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
was
apportioned
75-25,
75
percent
to
the
state
of
nebraska,
when
those
inflows
arrived
at
the
whalen
tri-state
reach.
it
is
clear,
and
i
think
all
of
the
parties
are
agreed,
that
those
flows
were
arithmetically
included
in
the
fund
of
water
that
was
apportioned
in
that
reach.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
in
1945.
in
1945,
there
was
no
standard,
really,
to
make
a
judgment
beyond
the
75-25
apportionment.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
see
my
time
is
done.
thank
you.
