ms.
gale
norton
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
colorado
is
today
involved
only
in
the
issue
of
claims
of
nebraska
for
water
below
tri-state
dam.
for
us,
it
is
a
very
important
issue,
because
it
determines
not
just
the
scope
of
issues
to
be
tried
in
this
case,
but
whether
colorado
is
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
the
case
is
essentially
an
allegation
by
nebraska
of
decree
violations
by
wyoming.
there
is
absolutely
no
allegation
that
colorado
has
in
any
way
violated
the
decree.
tri-state
dam
is
essentially
on
the
nebraska-wyoming
state
line.
the
area
below
tri-state
dam
was
tried
in
the
original
1945
decision,
and
in
that
case
the
court
found,
after
there
had
been
litigation,
that
the
area
below
tri-state
dam
was
adequately
served
by
local
supplies.
those
were
return
flows
from
irrigation.
those
included
the
rain
that
fell
in
that
area,
but
local
supplies
were
adequate
without
any
call
on
the
upstream
wyoming
and
colorado
share
of
the
river
to
preserve
the
irrigation
within
the
nebraska
areas.
downstream,
or
upstream
from
tri-state,
nebraska
has
large
rights
in
the
water.
it
derives
water
from
storage
rights,
from
reservoirs
that
have
been
built
upstream
for
the
benefit
of
nebraska,
and
it
also
has
specifically
allocated
to
it
within
the
decree
various
canals
and
the
ability
to
draw
water
from
those
canals.
what
nebraska
seeks
in
this
case
is
apparently
the
ability
to
go
beyond
what
has
been
decreed
to
it
and
to
introduce
evidence
about
various
equities
that
have
developed,
equities
developing
from
the
fact
that
it
has
had
excess
water
beyond
the
limited
amount
that
it
is
given
in
the
decree,
and
that
because
of
that
extra
benefit
it
has
had
through
the
years,
it
has
developed
equities
in
reliance
on
that
excess
water.
essentially
what
nebraska
is
trying
to
do
is
to
circumvent
the
limited
nature
of
the
enforcement
action
in
which
the
special
master
is
currently
involved.
this
court
agreed
to
hear
the
case
essentially
as
an
enforcement
action.
twice,
nebraska
has
attempted
to
modify
its
petition
in
order
to
expand
and
to
allow
amendment
and
modification
of
the
decree
itself.
the
first
time
this
court
denied
outright
that
attempt
to
expand
the
action.
the
second
attempt
is
still
pending
before
this
court.
nebraska's
approach
drastically
changes
the
nature
of
this
action
from
determining
whether
simply
the
four
specified
violations
by
wyoming
are,
indeed,
violations
of
the
compact,
to
a
complex
trial,
including
a
trial
on
the
equities
of
current
usage
and
on
the
issues
of
the
need
for
water
for
endangered
species.
this,
certainly
for
colorado,
presents
the
potential
of
a
reshuffling
of
the
equities.
we
have
settled
equities
from
the
1945
decision,
and
we
are
very
concerned
about
any
attempt
to
reopen
those
equities
and
to
reweigh
those
equities.
ms.
gale
norton
we
currently
have
very
specific
reservation
of
water
under
the
compact.
if,
however,
it
is
reopened
to
say
that
additional
water
comes
from
upstream
to
supply
nebraska's
needs,
potentially--
ms.
gale
norton
--we
are
concerned
essentially
here
about
just
the
platte,
although
broadly
speaking,
if
it
were
to
reopen...
there's
absolutely
no
need
to
reopen
the
laramie
decree
in
this
case,
but
we
also
have
great
interest
on
the
south
platte
as
well,
and
because
the
whooping
crane
habitat
and
the
habitat
of
the
other
endangered
bird
species
is
about
230
miles
downstream
into
nebraska,
beyond
the
confluence
of
the
north
platte
and
the
south
platte,
if
that
were
to
be
opened
up
to
determine
what
the
water
needs
of
whooping
cranes
are,
then
that
would
potentially
endanger
our
rights
on
the
south
platte
as
well.
all
of
these
issues
are
currently
being
considered
in
an
endangered
species
proceeding
on
lake
mcconahay.
at
every
point
when
a
new
project
is
considered,
the
endangered
species
issues
are
likewise
considered
there.
there's
certainly
no
reason
in
this
enforcement
action
to
open
up
the
decree
to
consideration
of
new
issues
like
that.
essentially
what
we
ask
this
court
is
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
analysis
should
be
a
backward-looking
interpretation
of
the
decree
itself.
in
order
to
rule
on
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
is
necessary
only
to
look
at
the
decree,
the
decision
of
the
pre-1945
record.
ms.
gale
norton
we
would
like
to...
if
i
understand
your
question,
we
would
like
to
see
that
there
is
no
modification
to
reopen
the
petition.
we
would
like
to
see
a
ruling
for
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
is
that
nebraska
is
not
allowed
to
raise
additional--
ms.
gale
norton
--if
there
is
a--
ms.
gale
norton
--it
is
not
necessary
at
all
for
an
interstate
water
decree
to
be
adjusted
because
there
are
increased
needs
in
one
of
the
downstream
states.
we
have
settled
responsibilities.
ms.
gale
norton
yes.
ms.
gale
norton
the
proper
way
to
address
these
issues,
if
they
were
to
be
addressed,
would
be
through
a
modification
of
the
decree
through
a
petition
by
this
court
meeting
the
standards
for
a
new,
equitable
apportionment
in
front
of
this
court.
what
we
have
now
is
only
an
enforcement
action,
and
whether
a
violation
has
occurred
or
not
should
be
determined
based
on
looking
at
the
existing
decree,
not
at
wide
open
modifications
of
that
decree.
i'd
like
to
note
finally
that
it
is
important
to
understand,
as
nebraska
attempts
to
say,
that
there
are
reliances
by
downstream
water
users,
that
their
needs
are
satisfied
through
the
process
of
reuse
of
water.
they
have
specific
claims
to
allow
water
into
their
irrigation
canals,
and
that
water
is
then
reused
as
it
goes
through
the
process,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
all
of
nebraska's
claims
are
properly
satisfied
and
that
is
the
way
the
decree
contemplated
they
would
be
satisfied.
it
is
why
this
court
felt
that
there
were
adequate
local
supplies
in
1945
in
order
to
satisfy
those
needs.
we
ask
the
court
to
give
us
the
certainty
that
is
necessary
within
the
context
of
interstate
water
allocations.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
