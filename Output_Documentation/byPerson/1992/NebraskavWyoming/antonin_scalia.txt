do
you
want
us
to
deny
all
three
of
the
additional
counts
that
nebraska
wants
to
add?
is
that
what
you're
asking?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
nebraska
to
do
about
these
grievances?
i
mean,
assuming
nebraska
still
feels
that
she
has
a
good
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can't
run
away
from
it
entirely.
i'll
come
back
sometime,
i
assume,
right,
just
not
in
these
proceedings?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
merits
question.
you're
not
arguing
the
merits
question
to
us.
i
thought
you
were
just
saying,
look,
we've
got
enough
complications.
this
goes
beyond
what
this
case
has
been
about,
and
therefore
these
amendments
should
not
be
allowed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
telling
me
not
only
should
the
amendments
not
be
allowed,
but
these
claims
are
not
bringable.
they
are
surely
bringable.
i
mean,
they
may
be
no
good
on
the
merits,
but
you
want
them
to
start
a
separate
proceeding,
is
that
what
you
think
should
be
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
this
is
what
i
don't
understand.
tell
me
how
proof
concerning
the
return
flows,
the
extent
of
them
and
so
forth,
has
anything
to
do
with
what
the
decree
said,
what,
40,
45
years
ago?
how
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
why
isn't
that
question...
that's
what
you...
and
that's
what
you
say,
and
you
say
that
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
those
flows,
and
they
say
no,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
them.
maybe
it
was
part
of
the
understanding,
part
of
the
reason
they
didn't
give
you
more
of
the
direct
apportionment,
maybe
it
wasn't,
but
you
don't
have
an
entitlement
to
them...
right?
that
is
the
issue
of
law.
how
can
that
issue
of
law
be
affected
by
the
facts
concerning
how
substantial
those
return
flows
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that,
and
that
can
prove
that
it
is
very
important
to
nebraska
that
the
answer
be
x
instead
of
y,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
proves
the
answer
is
x
rather
than
y.
it
may
prove
that
you're
losing
more
in
getting
a
judgment
against
you,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
proves
that
the
decree
meant
one
thing
half
a
century
ago
rather
than
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
other
side
says
that
it's
not
a
matter
of
just
being
silent
about
it,
that
article
iv
of
the
decree
seemingly
excludes
it.
