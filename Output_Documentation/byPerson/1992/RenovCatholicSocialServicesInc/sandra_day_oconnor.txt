justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
did
the...
did
ins,
in
your
view,
have
authority
to
determine
that
the
regulations
were
invalid
in
a...
in
an
ordinary
proceeding
brought
by
an
alien?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
we
have
a
virtually
identical
provision
before
us
in
mcnary
against
the
haitian
refugees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
operative
language
in
section
1255
(a)(f)
is
a
determination
respecting
an
application.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
certainly
is
arguable,
anyway,
that
that
means
a
determination
that
the
ins
itself
could
make.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mann,
i
guess
we
said
in
irwin
that
at
least
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
statutory
time
limits
incorporate
principles
of
equitable
tolling.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
this
is
a
time
limit
that
could
be
equitably
tolled?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
certainly
the
proposed
regulations
would
indicate
as
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they're
a
little
counterintuitive.
to
say
that
an
alien
who
is
here
by
presenting
false
documents
is
to
be
presumed
legally
here
is
a
bit
counterintuitive,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
abascal,
i
guess
there
is
the
difference
here
that
whether
the
regulations
are
valid
or
not
presents
just
a
question
of
law--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
at
some
level
a
court,
a
district
court
or
a
court
of
appeals,
could
address
and
decide
without
the
necessity
of
a
factual
record
of
some
kind.
