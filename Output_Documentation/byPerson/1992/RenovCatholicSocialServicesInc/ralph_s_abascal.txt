mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
like
in
mcnary,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case.
the
regulations
adopted
by
ins
violated
the
two
respective
statutes.
the
merits
of
those
regulations
are
not
before
the
court.
the
merits
of
the
regulations
and
the
order
invalidating
them
were
not
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
the
argument
that
was
being
made
earlier
by
mr.
mann
attempting
to
justify
at
least
the
lulac
regulation
suggests
that
they
have
an
argument
to
make
to
justify
that
regulation.
but
that
argument
was
not
made
to
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
no.
but
the
issue--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--no.
the
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
similarly
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeal
by
the
government.
the
court
of
appeal
itself,
sua
sponte,
raised
jurisdiction
after
oral
argument
and
then
withdrew
submission
of
the
case
when
it
learned
of
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
mcnary.
after
mcnary
came
down
the
government
conceded
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
disputed
either
that
irca
provided
very--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--no,
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
government
tried
to
concede
jurisdiction.
they
tried,
they
attempted
to
concede--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--yes.
it
is
not
disputed
that
irca
provided
very
very
important
benefits,
beginning
with,
at
the
foundation
of
it,
an
extensive
education
and
outreach
program
mandated
by
congress
so
that
aliens
could
learn
the
requirements
to
obtain
legalization
through
the
program.
also,
congress
provided
for
a
stay
of
deportation
and
work
authorization
pending
the
determination
made
in
the
administrative
process
on
an
application,
a
very
important
provision
because
at
the
same
time
congress
enacted
a
prohibition
on
the
employment
of
undocumented
aliens,
so
work
authorization
was
particularly
important.
and
it's
not
disputed
that
legalization
is
a
very
important
benefit
to
this
class.
with
legalization
they
would
no
longer
need
fear
reporting
crime
when
they
were
crime
victims.
they
would
no
longer
need
fear
reporting
violations
of
labor
laws
and
a
myriad
of
other
things
that
we
take
for
granted
in
the
united
states,
because
contacting
government
would
no
longer
have
that
fear
of
deportation.
and
ultimately
the
most
priceless
benefit
that
was
to
be
provided
through
legalization
is
u.s.
citizenship,
because
after
a
period
of
time
as
temporary
resident
aliens
they
could
acquire
the
opportunity
to
ultimately
become
citizens
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
government
said
that
300,000
applications
have
been
filed.
that
is
not
precisely
correct.
the
stay
orders
that
have
been
issued
have
allowed,
in
essence,
people
who
believe
that
they're
class
members
to
opt
in
and
demonstrate
under
the
particular
standards
that
they
are
class
members.
ins
has
agreed
that
78,000
of
the
300,000
plus
who
have
sought
class
membership
are
preliminarily
class
members,
and
have
granted
them
work
authorization
and
a
temporary
stay
of
deportation
pending
the
outcome
of
appellate
review.
let
me
turn
first
to
jurisdiction.
the
issue
in
this
case
involves
precisely
the
same
text
involving
judicial
review,
a
determination
respecting
an
application,
that
was
involved
in
mcnary.
thus
it
raises
the
same
narrow
question
that
was
raised
in
mcnary,
whether
congress
intended
to
preclude
truly
meaningful
judicial
review
and
truly
meaningful
judicial
relief
in
these
two
class
actions,
raising
generic,
statutory,
and
constitutional
claims
for
which
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
of
review
that
is
in
(f)(4)
is
particularly
inappropriate,
as
this
court
held
in
mcnary.
secondly,
as
in
mcnary,
the
holding
that
special
review
applies
only
to
judicial
review
of
individual
denials
of
applications
is
the
second
issue
in
this
case.
it
applies
with
full
force
here.
these
cases
did
not
seek
judicial
review
of
individual
applications,
nor
did
the
aliens
in
these
cases
seek
orders
granting
them
legalization
or
that
would
entitle
them
to
legalization.
they
only
sought
to
have
corrected
one...
in
each
particular
case
to
have
corrected
one
standard
among
a
myriad
of
standards
that
would
be
applied
to
their
applications.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
but
there
were...
there
were
important,
if
you
will,
corollary
issues
in
this
case.
the
manner
in
which
the
regulation
was
utilized
in
the
application
process...
there
were
also...
discovery
was
very
valuable
in
this
particular
case,
and
also,
in
addition
to
discovery,
the
value
of
having
the
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence
from
people
other
than
the
applicants,
the
nature
and
the
manner
in
which
the
application...
excuse
me,
the
regulations
were
utilized,
was
very
very
important
to
us
in
the
litigation
of
this
case.
so
that
the
same
issue--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--that
arose
in
mcnary,
the
limitation,
the
type
of
evidence
that
could
be
introduced
in
the
administrative
application
process,
existed
here
with
full
force.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
one
case,
the
first
case...
catholic
social
services
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
the
other,
and
it
began
earlier.
it
began
very
early
after
congress
enacted
the
statute
because
aliens
were
being
apprehended
on
a
daily
basis.
the
very
important
benefit
that
existed
prior
to
the
application
process
was
a
stay
of
deportation
and
work
authorization
for
prima
facie
eligible
individuals.
now
the
statute
was
enacted
november
6th.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--1986,
your
honor.
at
the
same
time,
simultaneous
with
the
adoption
of
the
legalization
program,
was
adopted
the
prohibition
on
the
employment
of
undocumented
aliens.
so
at
that
moment
it
was
crucially
necessary
for
potential
applicants
to
obtain
a
stay
of
deportation
and
work
authorization,
because
they
were
subject
to
deportation
unless
they
could
show
prima
facie
eligibility.
8
days
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute
we
sought,
initially
in
this
case,
to
compel
ins
to
adopt
some
standards
defining
prima
facie
eligibility
so
that
stays
of
deportation
and
work
authorization
could
be
sought.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
well--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--justice
souter,
the
application
period
didn't
begin
for
7
months.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
in
subsection
(e)(1)
of
the
statute,
that
statute--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--an
individual
could
have
raised
the
question
in
the
application
process.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
the
answer
is
yes,
i'm
sorry.
but
in
subsection
(e)(1)
the
statute
provided
for
stays
of
deportation
and
work
authorization
for
prima
facie
eligible
individuals.
and
if
they
were
apprehended,
then
they
were
to
apply
within
30
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
application
process.
so
if
they
were
apprehended
the...
in
the
catholic
social
services
case
the
bureaucratic
terminology
is
advance
parole.
a
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
absence
was
defined
initially
in
a
telegram
as
an
absence
that
had
ins
prior
authorization.
that
is
to
say
that
an
undocumented
alien
who
wished
to
depart
from
the
country
and
return
should
first
go
to
ins
and
seek
permission
to
do
so,
an
interpretation
that
was
substantially
contrary
to
a...
to
the
doctrine
of
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
absences
that
had
evolved
over
a
20-year
period
that
was
struck
down
in
1984
in
ins
v.
phinpathya.
but
then
the
congress
overruled
that
decision
with
respect
to
the
statute
that
decision
applied
to,
and
then
utilized
the
same
terminology
in
this
particular
provision
of
irca.
so
that
if
a
person
was
apprehended
without
prior
permission
to
leave
the
country,
then
they
were
subject
to
deportation
and
ouster
from
the
country
if
they
did
not
have
advance
permission
from
ins
to
depart
the
country.
that
standard,
that
criterion
and
that
requirement
was
embodied
in
a
telegram,
in
a
telegram
only.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
case
suffers
a
bit
from
the
fact
that
the
merits
are
not
before
the
court.
the
merits
of
these
regulations,
the
validity
of
the
regulations
and
an
understanding
of
how
they
operated
were
raised
in
the
merits,
so
that
it
was
important...
that
was
the
initial...
the
initial
objective
in
catholic
social
services.
when
the
telegram
issued,
then,
containing
the
interpretation
of
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
that
it
did,
the
complaint
was
amended
and
that
was
challenged.
the
district
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
18
days
after
the
statute
became
effective,
a
nationwide
tro
that
was
appealed
by
ins
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
then
6
months
later
the
ninth
circuit
vacated
its
opinion
so
that
it
precluded
litigation
in
the
district
court
for
that
period
of
time
that
the
case
was
before
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
the...
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
district
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
issuing
the
tro.
its
conclusion
was
that
ins
had
good
arguments
on
its
side
and
that...
that
we,
the
plaintiffs,
had
good
arguments
on
our
side,
and
therefore
it
was
abuse
of
discretion
to
have
issued
the
tro.
the
tro
was
stayed
throughout
the
period
of
appeal.
mcnary's
holding
that
special
review
applies
only
to
judicial
review
of
individual
denials...
excuse
me,
i
made
that
point
earlier.
this
case,
just
as
in
mcnary,
is
a
case
in
which
congress
had
readily
at
hand
far
broader
language
of
section
1331
preclusion
that
it
could
have
used.
mcnary
gave
examples
of
preclusive
language
that
would
have
precluded
a
challenge
to
a
regulation,
as
this
was.
mcnary...
mcnary
involved
policies
and
practices
that
was...
that
were
engaged
in
by
ins.
i
believe
that
the
argument
that
ins
is
making
in
this
case
is
that
the
distinction
between
mcnary
and
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
regulation
that
was
promulgated
through
the
process
of
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
as
opposed
to
the
policy
and
practice.
that
is,
the
principal
distinction
between
the
policies
and
practices
that
were...
not
the
substance
of
them,
but
the
policies
and
practices
that
were
engaged
in
mcnary
were
nationwide
policies
and
practices
but
they
were
not
formalized
into
a
regulation.
the
government's
argument
is
that
a
regulation
is
a
determination.
that
is
the
key...
the
key
to
their
argument,
that
it
is
a
determination.
but
this
court
held
in
mcnary,
in
the
united
auto
workers
v.
brock,
in
bowen
v.
michigan
academy
of
family
physicians,
that
a
determination
is
the
application
of
a
rule
to
a
set
of
facts.
it
is
like
two
versus...
two
times
five
equals
ten.
ten
is
the
determination;
it's
the
application
of
rule
to
fact.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
well--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--well,
if
the
rule
were
in
the
form
of
instructions
to
field
offices--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--well--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--there's
a
practical
problem
with
respect
to
the
question
in
that
there
was
only
a
12-month
application
period
and
the
form
of
judicial
review
occurred
pursuant
to
an
order
of
deportation,
so
that
the
first
case
that
would
arise,
if
there
was
no
regulation,
would
be
some
time
after...
or
some
time
after--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--within
the
ins,
yes.
there
was
something--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--well,
part
of
the
practical
problem
with
that
is
that
there's
a
12-month
application
process.
if...
if
there
was
no
regulation
which
operated
to
discourage
applications
and
if
the
entire
class
here
had
not
confronted
statements
at
ins
offices
or
at
their
agents;
there
was
a
group,
980-some-odd
organizations
that
contracted
with
ins
to
perform
the
application...
they
could
process
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
well,
i
think
if
that
decision
arose
after
the
12-month
period
of
time,
then
the
problems
would
be
much
less...
if
that
decision
arose--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--within
the
12-month
period
of
time.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
but
it
is
hard...
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
mean
to
avoid
your
question.
it
is
hard
for
me
to
avoid
the
question,
though,
other
than
in
practical
terms.
if...
if
i
may
respond
with
a
question...
or
not
a
question,
but
a
hypothetical
or
two.
if
the
lau,
the
legalization
appeals
unit,
arrived
at
that
decision,
let's
say
6
months
after
the
application
period
began,
and
then
applicants
who
came
to
ins
thereafter
were
told
you're
not
eligible,
we
are
rejecting
your
application.
we're
not
accepting
your
application
and
then
denying
it;
that
is
critical
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
they
did
not
accept
all
applications,
but
rather
they
had
a
standard
that
existed
in
an
unpublished
manual.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
your
honor,
we
did
not
learn
of
the
existence
of
the
legalization
manual
until
just
weeks
before
the
application
period
closed.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
we
did
not
know
it
existed.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
the...
the
manual
is
particularly
important
in
the
practice
that
was
followed
pursuant
to
that
manual
with
respect
to
relief.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
no,
we
didn't.
no,
but
what...
my
response
is
the
knowledge
of
the
manual
itself.
the
policy
we
knew
of,
but
the...
what
is
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
the
manual
is
that
a
rejection
should
have
been
met
by
an
insistence
to
file.
the
very
first
telegram,
it's
called
legalization
wire
number
1--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
but
the
front
desk
policy...
front...
there's
a
close
relationship
between
the--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--we
knew
of
the
policy
of
rejecting
applications
very
early
on.
the
very
first--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--in
lulac,
the
second
case...
the
second
case
was
filed
midway
through
the
application
period,
and
the
second
cause
of
action
directly
addressed
the
policy
of
deterring
and
discouraging
applications.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
we
alleged
that
as
the
basis
for
rejecting
applications,
turning
applicants
away
before
they
filed
an
application.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
they
alleged
it,
but
the
court
did
not
reach
that
question.
that
was
in
another
cause
of
action
the
court...
that
case
is
still
pending.
the
court
only
reached
two
questions--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--of
four...
four
claims.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
no.
the
very
first--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--the
very
first--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--in
catholic
social
services
the
telegram
that
was
issued
to
all
offices
8
days
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute
interpreted
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
as
requiring
a
request
for
authorization
to
depart
the
country.
that
was
invalidated.
that...
that
was
later
incorporated
into
a
promulgated
regulation
pursuant
to
the
apa,
but
the
policy
existed
in
that
telegram.
in
addition,
the
telegram
said
that
persons
who
have
not
had
advance
parole,
prior
permission
to
depart
the
country,
are
deemed
to
be
ineligible
to
apply.
and
because
they
are
deemed
ineligible
to
apply,
then
the
front
desking
policy
followed
from
that.
moreover,
the
regulations
that
were
adopted
finally,
or
the
policy
finally
incorporated
into
regulations
that
were
public,
the
preamble
defining
those
eligible
classes
began,
and
it
said:
the
following
categories
of
aliens
are
eligible
to
apply...
eligible
to
apply.
and
the
negative
inference
is
that
if
you
do
not
fit
into
the
categories
that
follow,
you're
not
eligible
to
apply.
that
regulation
is
section
245(a).2(b).
the
very
first
subparagraph
that
began
after
that
described
these
two
classes.
the
following
categories
are
eligible
to
apply:
those
who
have
continuous
residence
between
november
1st,
1982
and
the
enactment
date
of
the
statute.
the
regulation
interpreted
that
statute
in
the
manner
suggested
by
justice
o'connor
earlier,
that
if
a
person
came
through
with
fraudulently
obtained
documents,
that
the
facial
validity
of
their
entry
then
converted
their
residence
into
lawful
residence
and
it
broke
the
continued
period
of
unlawful
residence.
the
second
parenthetical
phrase
in
that
particular
subsection
said
people
who
have
continuous
physical
presence
within
the
united
states.
other
regulations
interpreted
continuous
physical
presence
as...
and
the
only
requirement...
as
obtaining
advance
parole,
permission
to
leave.
so
therefore
the
very
beginning
of
the
eligibility
section
says
that
these
aliens
are
not
eligible
to
apply.
now,
when
they
went
to
either
an
ins
office
or,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
agents
of
ins,
the
qde's,
the
qualified
designated
entities,
the
non--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--well,
the
government's
position--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--is
a
very
important
concession.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
it's
a
very...
no,
no,
the
government's
position
is
that
a
person...
i
believe,
my
understanding
from
their
brief,
is
that
a
person
must
submit
an
application,
a
written
document,
submit
that
application,
be
told
that
it
will
not
be
accepted
because
they
are
statutorily
ineligible
because
the
facts
of
their
particular
case
give
rise
to
those
two
regulations.
and
then--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--well,
i--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--frankly,
justice
scalia,
i'm
very
very
confused
by
the
extent
of
their
concession.
i
think
it
is
a
critical
concession
with
respect
to
remedy.
i
think
it
is
a
critical
concession.
it
is
first
made
in
the
reply
brief.
let
me
turn
to
what
i
understand
to
be
the
government's
position,
or...
excuse
me,
complaint...
that
a
person
must
submit
a
written
application,
have
it
rejected,
and
then
insist
upon
its
acceptance.
the
insistence
rule,
again,
is
contained
in
this
manual
that
is
under
the
front
desk.
we,
counsel
in
the
case,
did
not
become
aware
of
that
manual;
the
insistence
policy,
we
were
very
aware
of.
excuse
me...
we
were
very
aware
of
the
policy
of
deeming
the
classes
to
be
ineligible.
that's
the
way
we
pleaded
the
case.
we
did
not
know
that
there
was
some
insistence
policy
whereby
a
person
who
tried
could,
at
the
final
stage
of
a
plank,
insist
that
they
not
be
shoved
off,
and
under
those
circumstances
they
would
accept
the
application.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
we
do.
and
we
think--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--we
do,
and
let
me
explain
the
difference
between
that.
now,
the...
the
government's
concession
is
that,
as
i
understand
it,
someone
must
fill
out
a
piece
of
paper
with
all
of
the
evidence
necessary,
with
medical
examinations,
must
tender
a...
the
government
says
in
their
brief,
must
tender
the
application
fee...
between
$185
and
$420...
must
tender
that
fee,
and
then
when
they
refuse
to
accept
it,
insist
that
it
be
filed.
i
believe
that
the
appropriate...
that
the
appropriate
standard
to
apply
is
that
if
someone
contacts
ins
or
the
thousand
agencies
with
which
they
contracted,
indicates
their
desire
to
apply,
are
told
that
it's
futile
because
this
regulation
will
mean
that
you
will
be
denied,
that
that
is
an
application.
the
necessity
for
paper
ought
to
be...
under
these
circumstances
90
percent...
by
the
government's
own
statistics,
90
percent
of
the
applicant
pool
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
this
is
not
a
population
that
is
familiar
with
either
judicial
review
and
its
requirements
nor
is
it
familiar
with
the
institutions
of
government
in
the
united
states.
if
they
go
to
what
appears
to
be
an
authoritative
source...
i
want
to
apply,
you're
not
eligible...
for
the
government
to
insist,
then,
that
they
persist
in
the
filing
of
all
the
necessary
documents,
pay
and
offer
the
money,
it
seems
very
difficult
to
accept
that
as
a
reasonable
view
of
reality.
this
court...
this
court
in
teamsters
v.
the
united
states
in
1977,
a
title
vii
case,
defined
discouragees.
they
said:
if
an
employer--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--discouragees,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
they...
i'm
not
sure
that
they
used
discouragees.
let
me
explain
the
context
of
that.
this
court
said
in
1977
in
teamster
v.
the
united
states
that
if
an
employer
hangs
a
sign
on
the
front
gate,
no
blacks
need
apply,
no
irish
need
apply,
if
the
policy
is
well-known,
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
title
vii
claimant
to
actually
go
to
the
personnel
office
and
seek
a
job.
that
the
failure
to
go
to
the
personnel
office
and
seek
a
job
is
not
necessary
to
raise
a
claim
under
title
vii.
that,
i
think
is
a--
mr.
ralph
s.
abascal
--thank
you.
