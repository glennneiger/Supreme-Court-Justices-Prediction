mr.
mann,
is
there
a...
is
there
a
different
problem
with
impossibility
as
a
result
of
the
ins's
practice...
i
think
it
was
called
front
desking,
that
is
to
say
simply
not
accepting
the
applications
of
those
that
they
were
satisfied
under
the
regs
would
fail?
so
that
as
a
matter
fact,
given
the
front
desking
procedure,
there
is...
there
was
no
way
that
a
given
applicant
could
get
his
application
to
the
point
of
a
final
determination,
subject
to
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
does
go
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
it
also
go
to
the
question
of
the
appropriateness
of
applying
mcnary
here
on...
in
effect
on
an
impossibility
of
review
theory
otherwise?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
the
possible
application
or,
in
your
view,
extension
of
mcnary,
in
mcnary
what
if
the...
what
if
the...
what
if
the
action
in
this
case
had
been
filed
after
the
1-year
period
began
and
the
period...
and
the
practice
of
front
desking
was
known
and,
in
fact,
was...
was
pleaded,
would
that
affect
the
appropriateness
of
a
mcnary
kind
of
jurisdictional
determination?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--at
the
time
you
began
this
suit
what
were
some
of
the
details
of
the
manner...
as
you
put
it,
the
manner
in
which
the
regulations
were
applied
that
was
significant
in
stating
your
claim
for
relief?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
couldn't...
couldn't
the
issues
that
you
thereby
wished,
really,
to
short
circuit,
have
been
raised
in
the
course
of
a
given
application
and
the
litigation
of
that
application
when
the
time
came,
when
the
1-year
period
began
to
run?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
i
can
understand
your...
your
desire
to...
the
convenience,
indeed,
and
the
utility
from
your
standpoint
of
raising
it
this
way.
but
were
you
precluded
from
raising
these
kinds
of
issues
in
the
normal
course
of
application,
adjudication,
denial,
or
grant?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right.
and
i...
i
realize
that
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
thereby
raise
the
issue
until
the
attorney
general
designated
the...
the
point
at
which
the
1-year
period
began.
but
when
it
began,
is
there
any
reason
that
you
could
not
have
raised
these
issues
in
the
course
of
an
application
proceeding
by
a
given
individual
applicant?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
want
to
be
short
with
you
but
i
may
get
lost
in
the
forest
here.
what's
the
answer,
yes
or
no,
and
then
tell
me...
tell
me
why...
if
the
answer
is
no,
why
you
couldn't
have
raised
it
in
the
normal
course.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
this,
by
the
way,
clear
at
the
time
you
began...
at
the
time
the
litigation
began,
or
is
this
a
fact
that...
that
emerged
later
during
the
12-month
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
this
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
the
government
was
correct
that
this
is
no
part
of
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
what...
all
i'm
getting
at
is
at
the
time
these
two
proceedings
were
begun,
you
did
not
allege,
because
you
did
not
know,
that
as
a
result
of
a
so-called
front
desk
policy
you
would
not
either
be
allowed
to
or
you
would
be
deterred
from
litigating
in
the
normal
course.
you
didn't
know
that
and
you
didn't
allege
it;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
may
i
interrupt
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
just
go
back
to
one
thing
that
bothers
me?
did
you
so
allege
and
was
this
part
of
your
claim,
that
you
had
no
effective
means
of
litigating
these
issues
in
the
normal
course
of
individual
determinations
because
of
the
front
desk
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
whatever
the
relationship
is,
did
you
know
of
this
and
did
you
so
allege
it
at
the...
when
you
began?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
allege
that
in...
in
your
petition?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
alleged
that
as
the
means...
as
the
reason
that
you
could
not
litigate
individual...
these
issues
on
individual
determinations.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you
did
not
allege
that,
i
take
it...
or
the
applicants
did
not
allege
that
in
the
first
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
