mr.
mann,
could
i
just
ask
one...
the
statute's
kind
of
long
and
i
forget
one
point
in
it.
i
know
the
statute
provides
that
this
timely
application...
the
attorney
general
shall
adjust
the
statute
if
there's
an
application
filed
within
a
year
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
does
it
ever
say
that
he
shall
not
adjust
the
statute...
the
status
if
an
application
is
not
timely
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
negative
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
statutory...
at
least
no
express
statutory
prohibition
against
the
attorney
general
granting
an
extension
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
where
does
he
get
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
he
has
no
statutory
authority
to
simply
say
we
will...
we
will...
because
our
offices
are
crowded
and
overloaded
and
everything,
we
will
grant
a
30-day
grace
period
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
statutory
prohibition
against
that,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
your
response
to
his
definition
of
discouragee?
why
is
it
different
from
hanging
the
sign
on,
no
blacks
allowed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
a
discriminatory
practic
that
imposed
considerable
headwinds
to
these
people
applying
for
the
relief
under
the
statute.
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
neither
does
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
neither
does
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
specifies
a
period
in
which
you
may
apply,
but
it
doesn't
have
the
other
language
in
it
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
fair
reading
that
you
must,
because...
but
it's
also
a
fair
reading
that
if
you're
going
to
seek
relief
for
being
denied
a
job,
you
ought
to
apply
for
the
job.
that's
a...
that
would
be
your
normal
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
a
remedial
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
did
have
a
sign
up
that...
on
the
site
that
said
don't
apply
unless
such
and
such,
apply,
and
then
they
didn't
apply.
would
then...
would
they
then
be
discouraged
or
would
they
have
to
come
in
and
file
the
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you'd
apply
the
same
rule
as
in
title
vii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
or
would
not
have
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
