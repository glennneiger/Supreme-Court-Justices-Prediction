mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
the
provisions
of
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
1986
that
granted
amnesty
to
certain
longstanding
illegal
aliens.
the
case
presents
two
class
actions
challenging
regulations
the
attorney
general
promulgated
to
interpret
eligibility
requirements
under
the
act.
in
one
case
a
regulation
interpreting
a
proviso
that
allowed
an
alien
to
gain
relief
even
if
he
had
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
absences
from
the
united
states,
in
the
other
a
regulation
interpreting
the
requirement
that
the
aliens'
immigration
status
have
been
continuously
unlawful
since
1982.
in
each
case
a
class
of
aliens
filed
suit
in
a
federal
district
court
in
california
and
secured
a
ruling
holding
the
challenged
regulations
invalid.
both
of
the
district
courts
then
proceeded
to
require
ins
to
grant
the
benefit
of
the
ruling
not
only
to
aliens
who
filed
applications
before
the
program
expired,
but
also
to
aliens
who
applied
after
the
deadline
in
may
1988.
the
government
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
those
orders
have
continued
in
effect
while
the
case
has
been
pending
and
ins
has
been
obligated
to
continue
accepting
applications
for
the
more
than
4-1/2
years
since
may
1988.
it
has
accepted
about
300,000
so
far.
in
our
view
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
for
two
separate
reasons.
first,
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
ins
determinations
regarding
whether
or
not
members
of
the
respondent
class
were
eligible
for
relief
under
the
act.
and
second,
even
if
it
did
have
jurisdiction
it
was
improper
for
the
district
courts
to
grant
relief
to
aliens
who
failed
to
apply
before
the
program
expired
in
may
of
1988.
on
the
first
question
the
key
factor
is
the
framework
for
judicial
and
administrative
review
set
forth
in
section
1255a(f).
on
its
face
that
framework
bars
any
immediate
judicial
review
of
a
decision
denying
an
application.
rather,
an
alien
can
seek
relief
from
a
court
only
after
deportation
proceedings
have
been
instituted
and
completed
and
the
alien
is
subject
to
a
final
order
of
deportation.
thus
although
the
statute
allowed
aliens
to
seek
relief
from
the
agency
while
retaining
their
confidentiality
and
anonymity,
they
could
not
obtain
judicial
review
of
an
adverse
agency
decision
without
giving
up
their
fugitive
status,
either
by
surrendering--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no.
ins
is
bound
by
regulations
that
are
issued
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
and
so
if
an
alien
had
filed
an
application
for
relief,
and
many
aliens
in
this
situation
did,
the
application
would
have
been
denied
and
undoubtedly
the
denial
would
have
been
affirmed
by
the
legalization
appeals
unit
if
the
regulation
remained
valid
at
the
time
the
appeal
was
taken.
the
regulations
were
withdrawn
before
the...
just
before
the
application
period
expired,
so
some
of
the
adjudications
would
not
yet
have
been
determined
by
the
legalization
appeals
unit.
but
what
that
would
do
is
that
would
place
that
alien
in
exactly
the
same
situation
as
any
alien
whose
application
was
denied.
for
example,
if
the
ins
determined
as
a
fact
that
the
alien
first
entered
the
united
states
in
1983
his
application
would
be
denied.
the
lau,
if
it
agreed
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
supported
that,
would
deny
the...
would
deny
the
appeal
and
the
alien
could
do
nothing.
if
the
alien
wanted
to
challenge
that,
he
would
have
to
give
himself
up
and
submit
to
our
immigration
laws
and
then
challenge
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
after
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes,
in...
in...
in
the
relevant
respects
we
believe
the
jurisdictional
provisions
in
mcnary
were
the
same
as
these,
and
the
difference
is
that
this
case
involves
a
different
type
of
claim.
the
claims
at
issue
in
mcnary
were
claims
that
could
not
have
been
reviewed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
administrative
record,
but
the
fundamental
claim
was
that
ins
was
deciding...
denying
applications
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
was
not
in
the
record.
and
so
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
reviewed
the
administrative
record
it
could
not
have
ascertained
whether
or
not
the
claim
was
correct
and
would
not
have
been
able
to
evaluate
it.
and
if
that
was
the
only
remedy
that
the
aliens
had,
they
really
would
not
have
had
effective
judicial
review.
by
contrast,
the
claims
here
are
that
ins
would
have
improperly
denied
applications
for
legalization,
and
the
only
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
needs
to
know
to
evaluate
that
claim
is
the
core
information
that's
required
to
determine
whether
he's
statutorily
eligible.
and
that
information
would
be
in
the
administrative
record.
that's
the
information
that's
put
on
the
form
i-687,
the
application
that
the
alien
files.
he
would
file
the
application.
it
would
be
denied,
probably
denied
by
the
lau.
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
that
application
and
it
would
be
perfectly
capable
of
making
its
own
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
those
facts
were
sufficient
to
justify
relief
under
the
act.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
that's
correct,
and
in
our
view
the
determination
in
this...
the
determination
in
this
case
is
the
regulation
which
ins
made.
ins
determined
that
certain
things
had
to
be
true
for
an
alien
to
be
entitled
to
relief.
the
determination
relates
to
an
application
of
a
member
of
the
respondent
class
because
the
only
claim
that
the
respondents
can
make
is
that
if
they
filed
an
application
it
would
have
been
denied,
or
that
they
did
file
an
application
and
that
they
expected
that
it
would
be
denied.
so
because
they're
challenging
its
effect
on
them
it's
a
determination
respecting
each
of
their
individual
applications,
and
that's
how
we
read
the
statutory
language
to
apply.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
now
that
goes
to
the
second
question,
the
remedial
question,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--yes.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
no,
we
don't
really
think
it
does.
in
our
view
the
jurisdictional
question
is...
this
case
was
filed
in
november
of
1986
several
months
before
the
application
period
started.
the
district
court
is
presented
with
a
complaint
and
the
question
is
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
over
that
complaint.
now,
at
that
time
there
were
18
months,
more
or
less,
maybe
17
months
left
before
the
application
period
was
going
to
expire.
and
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
way
that
the
district
court
could
have
determined
at
that
time
that
there
was
no
way
these
people
could
file,
particularly
if
you
look
at
the...
so
i
don't
think
that's
really
relevant
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
the
jurisdictional
question,
it
seems
to
me,
turns
on
whether
this
is
a...
whether
the
determination
they
challenged,
which
is
the
regulation,
is
a
determination
respecting
an
application
in
light
of
the
way
that
this
court
interpreted
that
phrase
in
mcnary.
now--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well
if
you're...
if
you're
filing
a
suit
challenging
ins's
practices
of
accepting
applications...
for
example,
if
the
complaint
isn't
that
ins
has
an
improper
regulation
for
determining
whether
you
are
eligible
for
relief,
but
instead
that
ins...
ins
officers
are
refusing
to
accept
applications,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a...
that
is
a
type
of
claim
that
arguably
might
be
covered
by
mcnary,
but
that's
not
the
claim
that's
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
only
people
with
respect
to
whom
ins
appealed
in
this
case
are
people
who
did
not
apply
for
relief
under
the
act.
i
mean
if
you
look
at...
and
if
you
look
in
the
record
you
can
see
where
the
district
courts
defined
the
groups
to
whom
they
extended
relief.
but
we
didn't
appeal
with
respect
to
the
people
who
applied
for
relief.
and
it's
our
position,
ins's
position,
that
if
you
went
into
an
ins
office
and
if
you
attempted
to
apply
for
relief
and
they
refused
to
accept
your
application...
which,
as
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
would
have
violated
ins's
policies
as
set
forth
in
the
legalization
manual...
if
you
did
that,
we
believe
that
you
have,
in
fact,
applied.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
in
order
to
meet
the
statutory
time
deadline
you
have
to
force
ins
to
accept
your
application
and
put
a
stamp
on
it.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
you
have
to
apply.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
and
it's
our
view
that
if
you
walk
into
ins's
offices
and
you
attempt
to
apply,
it's
one
thing
if
they
say
we
don't
think
you're
going
to
get
relief
and
so
you
shouldn't
waste
the
money.
but
if
they
say
no,
we
refuse
to
accept
your
application,
we
will
not
take
it,
you
have
applied.
and
there
are
cases
that
are
cited
in
both
parties'
briefs
in
which
ins
did
similar
things
and
ins
has
granted
relief
to
those
people.
for
example
a
person--
--on
the
second
question,
which
is
what
i
was
talking
about
with
justice
souter,
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
for
the
district
courts
to
accept
jurisdiction
over
these
cases
in
the
first
place,
it
certainly
was
improper
for
them
to
grant
relief
to
individuals
who
did
not
satisfy
the
requirements
for
relief
that
congress
articulated
in
the
statute.
the
first
of
the
four
statutory
requirements
for
relief
is
set
forth
in
section
1255a(a)(1),
and
that
requirement
is
that
the
alien
have
filed
an
application
during
a
specified
12-month
period.
because
the
government
did
not
appeal
the
district
court's
judgments
with
respect
to
aliens
who
filed
applications,
as
i
just
mentioned,
none
of
the
respondents
before
this
court
satisfied
that
requirement
and
thus
they
are
not
eligible
for
relief
because
of
section
1255a(a)(1).
the
provision
that
they're
seeking
to
avoid
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations.
this
is
not
an
individualized
filing
requirement
that
can
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
what
they're
seeking
to
evade
is
one
of
a
series
of
statutory
deadlines
that
congress
put
in
the
statute
to
determine
exactly
which
group
of
illegal
aliens
were
going
to
get
relief.
the
first
requirement
was
that
the
alien
have
been
here
since
1982
and
that
his
status
had
been
unlawful.
the
second
requirement
was
that
the
alien--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--it
does
not
expressly
say
that,
but
it's
our
view--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--that
the
only...
the
only
basis
that
ins
would...
all
of
the
people
in
the
class
are,
by
definition,
people
who
are
illegally
here.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
don't...
i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
views
it
that
way.
the
problem
is
that
the
only
basis
that
the
attorney
general
has
for
allowing
these
people
to
have
any
lawful
status
in
this
country
is
if
they
meet
each
of
the
four
requirements
in
1255a(a).
if
they
don't
meet
those
requirements,
he...
he
doesn't
really
have
a
basis
for
allowing
them
to
stay
here
lawfully.
he
has...
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
souter,
if...
if
for
example,
there's
a
case
where
a
person
came
in
on
the
last
day
and
attempted
to
apply
and
the
person
said
no,
come
back
tomorrow,
you
don't
have
an
appointment,
he
determined
that
that
person
had
applied
and...
and
granted
relief
to
that
person
because
they
came
in
and
did
everything
they
did
and
an
ins
person
wrongfully--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--because
the
statute
requires
a
person
to
apply,
and
the
attorney
general
has
interpreted
the
word
apply
to
include
a
person
who
comes
into
the
office
and
attempts--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
don't
think
the
attorney
general
would
have
had
the
authority
to
do
that.
i
think
he
would
have
just--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--there's
no
express
statutory
prohibition
on
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes,
we
think
he
could
have.
i
would...
i
would
say
the
attorney
general
was
obligated
under
section
1255
(a)(g)
to
implement...
to
pass
regulations
and
he
did
that
before
the
application
period
commenced.
but
obviously
some
cases,
no
matter
what
the...
how
specific
the
regulations
are,
are
going
to
arise
and
it
will
raise
legal
questions
that
are
not
explicitly
discussed
in
the
regulations.
and
what
would
happen
in
those
cases
is
the
application
would
be
decided
by
the
legalization
appeals
unit.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
believe
that
respondents
would
probably
take
the
same
position
even
if
this
was
adopted
by
a
legalization
appeals
unit
decision.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i
believe
that
their
view
is
the
only
thing
the
statute
does
not
cover
is
if
an
individual...
particular
individual
files
an
application
and
it
is
denied,
on
i'm
not
sure
what
particular
basis.
i
guess
if
it's
denied
on
the
basis
of
something
that...
that
would
not
deny
anybody
else's
application.
a...
a--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
in
most
cases
i
believe
that's
true
because
the
requirements
for
relief
are
fairly
generalized;
you
have
to
be
here
since
1982
unlawfully
and
you
have
to
have
not
left
since
1986.
the
brief,
casual
and
innocent
absence
actually
is
one
of
the
most
soft
provisions
in
the
statute,
because
there
obviously
is
some
play
in
that
particular
phrase
could
mean,
but
being
here
since
1982
is
a
clear
provision.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that...
legal
questions
that
arose
under
the
act
and
some
of
them...
most
of
them
were
decided
by
regulations,
but
some
of
them
were
decided
by
the
lau.
talking
about
the
second
question
again,
as
i
mentioned
the
statute
has
three
different
time
deadlines
that
aliens
have
to
meet
to
fall
within
the
class
of
aliens
who
are
eligible
for
relief.
they
have
to
have
been
here
continuously
and
unlawfully
since
1982,
they
have
to
have
been
here
continuously
since
the
act
was
passed
in
1986,
and
they
have
to
have
sought
relief
within
the
first
18
months
after
the
act
was
passed
in
1986.
now,
under
that
scheme
respondents'
failure
to
seek
relief
before
the
statute
expired
cannot
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
their
individual
circumstances.
they
just
didn't
make
themselves
eligible
for
relief,
any
more
than
a
person
who
didn't
come
to
the
united
states
until
1983
would
be
eligible
for
relief.
the
seriousness
with
which
congress
viewed
this
particular
requirement,
the
timely
filing
requirement,
is
particularly
clear
from
section
1255a(f)(2).
although
subdivisions
(3)
and
(4)
of
1255a(f)
require
judicial
review
and
a
level
of
administrative
appellate
review
generally
for
determinations
about
eligibility,
they
expressly
bar
any
judicial
or
even
any
administrative
review
with
respect
to
an
application
that's
denied
as
being
untimely.
now
in
light
of
that,
we
think
it's
particularly
inappropriate
for
a
court
to
believe
that
it's
empowered
to
extend
the
deadline,
when
congress
has
attempted
to
put
the...
that
particular
question
beyond
judicial
review
entirely.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
correct.
but
we
don't
believe
that
irwin
substantially
changed
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
that
issue.
what...
what
irwin
says
is
that
generally
congress
believes
that
statutory
filing
deadlines
should
be
equitably
tolled.
now,
there
are
clearly
certain
types--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--in
our
view
this
is
not
the
type
of
time
limit
that
this
court
was
talking
about
in
irwin,
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
for
a
moment.
there's
a
distinction
to
us
between
an
individual
filing
deadline
and
a
statute
of
limitations,
for
example,
which
will
say
you
have
to
file
for
relief
within
6
years
after
your
cause
of
action
arises.
and
that
type
of
deadline
turns
on
an
individual's
fact
circumstances;
when
did
the
cause
of
action
arise?
and
that's
the
type
of
deadline
that
we
believe
is
at
issue
in
irwin.
now
sometimes
it
may
be
a
statute
of
limitations,
sometimes
it
may
be
called
something
else,
but
that's
one
type
of
statutes
to
which
we
think
equitable
tolling
generally
applies.
this
case
and
pangilinan,
however,
involve
something
different.
in
these
cases
congress
has
established
a
program
and
says
the
program
is
over.
the
program
in
the
pangilinan
case
ended
shortly
after
world
war
ii.
the
program
in
this
case
ended
on
may
4th,
1988.
and
we
don't
think
that
that
type
of
deadline
should
be
subject
to
tolling,
because
it's...
it's
a
requirement
for
relief.
now,
even
if
it
is
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
it
seems
to
us
that
the...
that
this
is
not
remotely
the
type
of
case
as
to
which
equitable
tolling
would
be
appropriate.
what...
what
ins
and
the
attorney
general
did
that
is
offered
as
a
justification
for
equitable
tolling
is
that
ins
issued
regulations
explaining
the
circumstances
under
which
it
believed
people
would
be
eligible
for
relief.
it
said
if
you
were
gone
from
the
united
states
without
advance
permission,
you're
not
eligible.
now,
whether
that
was
right
or
wrong,
that's
just
a
regulation
explaining
the
circumstances
in
which
you
may
or
may
not
be
eligible
for
relief.
and
what
respondents
should
have
done
and
what
anybody
who
wants
a
benefit
that's
offered
by
the
united
states
government
should
do,
is
you
apply
for
the
benefit
and
if
you
don't
agree
with
the
agency's
interpretation
you
challenge
it.
and
these
people
had
exactly
the
same
opportunity
for
judicial
review
as
everybody
else
under
the
act,
and
they
chose
not
to
apply
and
so
they're
not
eligible
for
relief.
i
would
point
out
that
quite
a
number
of
the
people
who
were
in
this
situation
did
apply
for
relief
and
they've
already
gotten
relief.
and
even
if
this
suit
had
not
been
filed
in
the
district
court,
they
would
have
gotten
relief
when
the
injunction...
when
the
regulations
were
withdrawn,
because
ins
would
have
had
to
given
the
relief
sooner
or
later.
when
the
person
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
they
could
not
have
deported
them
because
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
ruled
that
they
were
entitled
to
legalization
based
on
the
fact
that
ins
had
withdrawn
the
regulation.
the
real
reason
respondents
are
unable
to
secure
relief
is
that
they
declined
to
take
advantage
of
the
12-month
opportunity
congress
offered
them.
you
have
to
remember
this
was
an
extraordinary
statute.
congress
was
faced
with
a
huge
problem
involving
a
very
large
number
of
undocumented
aliens,
all
of
whom
were
illegally
here
in
violation
of
our
immigration
laws.
and
we
had...
congress
had
tried
for
years
to
deal
with
the
problem,
and
they
decided
that
the
best
way
to
deal
with
it
was
to
enact
a
program
that
was
going
to
allow
these
people
in
a...
for
a
short
time
period
to
seek
relief,
come
forward,
become
lawful
members
of
our
community,
and
join
this
country's
polity.
and
they...
in
order
to
get
people
to
apply
they
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
allowing
them
to
apply
for
relief
without
giving
up
their
right
to
remain
here
as
anonymous
fugitives
if
the
agency
denied
them
relief.
they
could
apply
for
relief,
and
under
the
confidentiality
provisions
ins
could
not
use
that
information
to
deport
them.
and
the
information
on
the
legalization
application,
if
it
was
sufficient
for
relief,
would
almost
certainly
make
them
deportable
because,
by
definition,
they
had
to
be
here
illegally.
and
they
allowed
you
to
apply
to
the
agency
anonymously
and
then
you'd
get
a
level
of
administrative
review,
appellate
review
within
the
agency,
but
they
stopped
short
of
allowing
you
judicial
review
while
you
remained
a
fugitive.
if
you
wanted
to
go
to
court
and
burden
the
federal
courts,
which
have
plenty
of
things
to
do
at
the
district
court
level,
you
had
to
make
a
choice.
and
the
choice
was
that
you
thought
you
were
entitled
to
legalization
and
you
wanted
to
come
forward,
submit
to
this
country's
laws,
and
join
its
citizenry
and
see
how...
whether
the
courts
believed
you
were
eligible.
and
if
they
said
that
you
were
eligible,
you
would
win.
there'd
be
one
judicial
proceeding
and
you
would
win
and
you
would
get
to
stay
here
lawfully.
and
if
you
lost,
you
would
have
to
leave.
and
that's
the
scheme
that
congress
enacted.
it
is
a
strict
limitation
on
judicial
review,
but
it's
a
strict
limitation
on
judicial
review
that's
coupled
with
a
remarkably
generous
program
granting
amnesty
to
a
very
large
class
of
unlawful
residents.
and
the
suggestion
that
ins
implemented
the
program
very
harshly
really
isn't
borne
out
by
the
historical
facts.
if
you
look,
ins
went
with
their
publicity
programs.
they
received
many
more
applications
than
congress
anticipated;
under
this
program
alone
more
than
1.7
million...
and
about
3
million
under
the
two
programs
together,
the
saw
program
at
issue
in
mcnary.
and
then
they
granted
94
percent
of
the
applications
they
received.
that's
more
than
1,600,000
people
have
already
received
lawful
temporary
resident
status
under
this
particular
provision.
and
i
think
that
although
the
administration
of
the
program
did
have
some
problems,
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
ins
went
about
this
with
an
eye
towards
granting
relief
to
the
smallest
number
of
people
that
it
possibly
could.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
i...
i--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--well,
actually,
if
you
compare
that
provision
of
the...
of
irca
with
a
corollary
provision
about
exclusion,
i
think
the
regulation
actually
comes
pretty
close
to...
to
being
correct.
what
you
have
to
remember
is
that
if
the
person
entered
with
a
false...
with
false
documents
in
that
manner
it
would
be
fair
to
say
the
person
entered
by
fraud,
and
a
person
who
enters
by
fraud
is
excludable
unless
he
can
secure
a
waiver
from
the
attorney
general.
and
so
what
the
regulation
effectively
did
is
by
saying
that
the
people
can't
come
in
at
all,
it
should
have
said
the
person
is
ineligible
for
relief
unless
he
can
secure
a
waiver
for
the
fraud
from
the
attorney
general.
and
that
regulation
was
overbroad.
now,
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
regulations
had
to
be
drafted
with
some
haste
and
ins
made
some
mistakes.
but
the
fact
that
ins
made
some
mistakes
in
the
regulation
does
not
excuse
individuals
from
seeking
relief
and
making
themselves
eligible.
in
our
view
that's
just
like
schweiker
v.
hansen.
in
that
case,
you'll
recall,
a
disabled
individual
went
into
an
hhs
office
and
said,
i
would
like
to
get
disability
benefits.
and
the
person
said,
you're
not
eligible
for
relief.
incorrectly...
it
was
conceded
that
that
advice
was
incorrect,
and
the
person,
relying
solely
on
that
advice,
didn't
apply
for
relief.
about
a
year
later
they
discovered
it
was
incorrect
and
they
went
back
and
applied.
and
because
they
had
not
applied...
there
was
a
substantive
requirement
that
you
apply...
they
had
forever
lost...
forever
lost
the
monetary
disability
benefits
that
they
could
have
gotten
if
they
had
applied
initially,
and
they
could
not
get
that
money
back.
it
was...
it
was
forever
lost
to
them
because
they
failed
to
apply
at
the
right
time,
and
their
sole
basis
for
failing
to
apply
was
that
a
government
person
misinterpreted
the
eligibility
requirements.
that's
very
much
like
this
case,
in
our
view,
and
that's
why
we
believe
it's
a
fundamental
principle
of
administrative
law
that
you
can't
just
accept
a
government
agent
telling
you
that
you're
not
eligible
for
relief
and
then
decline
to
make
yourself
eligible.
it
would
be
like
if
ins
had
told
these
people
they
weren't
eligible
and
so
they
decided,
well,
we'll
leave
after
1986
and
go
to
mexico
for
6
months
since
we
can't
get
legalization,
then
when
the
regulation
is
invalid
come
back.
it's
certainly
clear
that
a
court
would
not
order
ins
to
grant
relief
to
such
a
person,
and
we
really
don't
see
any
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
clarify...
i
didn't
really
realize
there
was
much
that
needed
to
be
clarified...
what
our
position
is
on
the
so-called
front
desking.
there
are
several
points
about
this.
the
first
is
i
don't
really
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
jurisdictional
question.
the
district
courts
in
this
case
concluded
that
they
had
jurisdiction
over
claims
that
certain
ins
regulations
regarding
eligibility
requirements
were
invalid.
we
believe
that
is
incorrect
and
that's
what
the
first
question
in
this
case
is.
the
second
question
in
this
case
is
even
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
was
it
proper
for
the
district
courts
to
grant
relief
to
people
who
did
not
file
in
a
timely
manner?
now,
it's
our
understanding
that
the
front
desking
argument
is
relevant
to
that,
on
the
idea
that
that
establishes
some
sort
of
affirmative
ins
misconduct
that
might
justify
equitable
tolling.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
we
don't
believe
equitable
tolling
applies
to
this
type
of
statute,
but
even
if
it
does
we
don't
believe
this
is
the
right
type
of
conduct.
what...
what
we
have
conceded,
though,
is...
we
did
not
appeal
from
the
district
court
with
respect
to
people
who
applied
for
relief
largely
because
they
were
going
to
get
relief
sooner
or
later
anyway,
so
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
appeal.
if
we
withdrew
the
regulations
the
people
would
eventually
secure
legalization,
and
so
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
continue
to
litigate
about
it.
it
is
our
view
that
there
are...
there
are
some
sets
of
fact
patterns
where
the
person
did
not
force
ins
to
accept
his
application
that
will
constitute
applying
for
relief
under
the
act.
people
who
never
went
to
an
ins
office,
in
our
view,
cannot
conceivably
fall
into
that
fact
situation.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well,
for
one
thing,
because
i
think
that
title
vii
is
violated
by
a
discriminatory
practice
that
the...
is
violated
by
discriminatory
practice
that
poses
a
considerable
headwind
to
blacks
getting
employment.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
i
don't
believe...
i
don't
believe
that
title
vii
contains
a
provision
saying...
that
says
that
you
have
to
apply
for
a
job
in
order
to
have
standing
under
the
act,
and
that
if
you
don't
courts
cannot...
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
excuse
me?
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
well--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--but
the
only
people--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
that's
quite
a
different
case
involving
title
vii
as
a
remedial
statute
directed
at
private
employers.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
this
is
a
statute
giving
a
very
important
immigration
benefit
to
private
individuals
from
the
government,
and
in
light
of
the
customary
requirements
that
people
apply
for
relief
from
the
government--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
think
if
the...
if
the
sign
said
we
will
not
accept
applications
from
people
who
are
in
the
following
fact
situations,
period,
i
believe
that
would
be
different.
but
i
think
if--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--no.
i
think
that
if
the
person...
i
think
that
if
the
person
in
that
case
came
into...
if
the
person
came
in
and
the
sign
was
there
and
the
person
refused
to
file
because
of
that
sign,
they
would
have
applied.
i'd
like
to
point
out,
though--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--they
would
have
applied.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
what...
what's
going
on
in
this
case
is,
if
you
look
at
the
legalization
manual
and
last...
we've
lodged
with
the
court
the
entire
part
of
the
legalization
manual
that's
at
issue
here.
if
you
go
into
an
ins
office
it
costs
you
$420
to
apply
for
a
family.
most
of
these
people
are
not
dramatically
wealthy,
and
that
is
quite
a
bit
of
money
to
them.
that
if
they
come
into
ins's
offices
and
the
person
looks
at
the
application
and
they're
statutorily
ineligible,
the
clerk
says
you're
not
going
to
get
relief.
if
the
person
still
wants
to
pay
the
$420,
the
manual
is
quite
clear
that
the
person
can
and
should
take
the
application.
it's
very
clear
about
this,
that
the
person
is
supposed
to
take
the
application.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
there
is
no
finding--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--there
is
no
finding
that
this
policy
was
violated.
with
all
candor,
i
would
be
willing
to
suspect
that
there
are
members
of
the
respondent
class
with
respect
to
whom
the
policy
was
violated.
these
were
not
highly
trained
people
and
some
of
them
may
have
made
mistakes.
but
i
can
say
that
ins
does
not
know
of
a
specific
named
individual
that
has
been
identified
to
us
respondents
with
respect
to
which
that
is
the
case,
but
there
were
a
lot
of
people
and
ins
may
have
made
mistakes.
that's
why
you
have
administrative
appellate
review,
so
that
ins
can
correct
its
mistakes.
a
few
other
things
i
wanted
to
mention.
one
of
the
most
important
things,
i
think,
from
the
argument
of
respondents
is
that
he...
he
agreed
that
there
was
really
no
reason
he
could
not
have
raised
these
claims
in
the
administrative
process.
in
connection
with
that
he
talked
about
the
telegram
that
the
government
issued
as
if
this
is
some
short,
casual
statement.
this
was
a
20-page,
very
detailed
document
setting
forth
all
of
the
criteria
to
get
the
program
going,
and
ins
got
that
out
only
8
days
after
the
statute
was
passed.
i
also
wanted
to
mention
that
it
appears
that
it
is
not
in
the
record
at
the
place
we
discussed
in
our
brief.
if
anyone
wishes
to
look
at
it,
it's
attached
to
an
affidavit
of
joseph
brandon,
which
is
at
docket
entry
7
of
the
record
in
the
catholic
social
services
case.
