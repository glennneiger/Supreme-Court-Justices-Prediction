mr.
mann,
can
you
tell
me
if
the
provisions
of
the
regulations
that
are
under
challenge
here
could
have
been
adopted,
instead
of
by
regulation,
through
adjudication?
that
is
to
say
could...
could
the...
the
ins,
instead
of
having
a
regulation
that
said
when
you
leave
the
country,
you
know,
it
breaks
the
chain
of
your...
of
your
residence,
could
the
ins
simply
have
decided
in
the
first
case
that
came
before
it
involving
that,
that
indeed,
this
individual
did
not
have
proper
residence
and...
and
then
could
have
continued
to
apply
that
precedent
in
later
cases.
could
it
have
done
it
that
way
instead
of
by
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
i
gather
that
if
this
hadn't
been
included
in
the...
if
this
detail
had
not
been
included
in
the
regulations
and
had
been
decided
in
adjudication,
there'd
be
no
doubt
that
this
provision
of
the
statute
did
not
cover
it.
so
whether
the...
you
know,
whether
the
statute
covers
it
or
not,
on
the...
on
the
respondents'
theory,
depends
upon
whether
it
was
adopted
by
rule
or
by
adjudication.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
then...
then
what
conceivably
would
the
statute
not
cover?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
hard
to
think
of
something
that
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that's
not
something
that
can
be
conceded,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if...
if...
what
would
your
answer
be
to
the
question
that
i
asked
mr.
mann
earlier?
suppose
this
particular
rule
had
been
adopted
not
by
regulation
but
by
adjudication,
so
that
the
ins--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regularly...
regularly
applied
this
rule,
but...
but
did
not
adopt
it
by
regulation;
that
would
make
no
difference
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
there
are
no
instructions
to
field
offices,
just...
just
the
first
case
that's
decided
applies
the
principle
that
if
you
leave
the
country
it
breaks
the
chain.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
all
the
later
cases
simply
follow
the
same
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
a
court
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
administrative
case.
the
first
administrative
officer
to
be
confronted
with
this
adjudicates
in
a
certain
fashion,
gets...
it
gets...
there
is
one
appeal
within...
within
the
ins.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
that
is...
that
case
is
appealed
within
the
ins.
the
appellate
officer
says,
no,
it
was
rightly
decided,
and
all
of
the
lower
officers
follow
that...
follow
that
adjudicative
ruling.
now
what
would
that
be
under
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
they...
they
would
confront
those
statements
because
the
ins
would
say
look
it,
we...
you
know,
we
don't
have
a
rule
on
the
subject,
but
i'll
have
to
tell
you
our
adjudicative
precedent
is,
and
we
follow
it,
that...
that
if
you've
left
the
country
it...
it
breaks
the
term
of
your
residence
in
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
within
the
12-month
time
you
treat
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah.
never
mind
all
the
practical
difficulties.
assume
it's
there;
how
do
you
treat
it
under
your
theory?
is
it
the
same
as
a
regulate...
it
is
a
determination
with
respect
to
a
case
or
not?
if
you
say
it
isn't,
then
all
this
is
going
on
just
so
the
ins
should...
should
have
done
it
by
adjudication
instead
of
by
rule,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
come
back
to
my
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
i
don't
think
you've
gotten
to
the
answer
of
yet.
well,
why...
i
don't
see
any
relationship
whatever
between
front
desking
and
the
issue
of
whether
what
you
have
when
there's
an
adjudication
is
a
determination...
or
whether
what
you
have
when
there's
a
rule,
for
that
matter,
is
a
determination
respecting
an
application
for
adjustment
of
status.
front
desking
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
it...
it
simply
has
to
do
with
the
issue
of
whether
you
have
an
effective
means
of
challenging
it,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
converted
from
a
determination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--respecting
an
application
into
not
a
determination
respecting
an
application
simply
because
of
front
desking.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
when
they
went.
the
government
has
already
conceded
that
anybody
that
went
is
home
free.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not
challenging
anybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
presented
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
him
to
say
that
this
morning.
i...
i
don't
recollect
precisely
how
they
said
it
in
their
brief--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
certainly
didn't
say
that
this
morning.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't...
haven't
you
asserted
in
this
complaint
that
even
people
who
never
presented
themselves
are
entitled
to
the
relief
you've
requested?
isn't
that
what
you've
asserted?
people
who
never
went
to
the
ins
offices
at
all;
they
never
got
near
that
desk.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
discouragees?
justice
antonin
scalia
defined
that...
that
is
a
word.
