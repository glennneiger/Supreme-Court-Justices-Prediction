justice
byron

white
but
this
involves
state
taxation
of
tribal
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
are
living
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the...
but
it
involves
both...
all
of
those
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
as
long
as
the--
--the
government
holds
title.
that
is
as
long
as
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--until
they...
if
it
has
been
transferred
to
a
non-indian.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that's
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
not
indian
country
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
still
has
to
be
in
the
hands
of
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
government
has
conveyed
the
patent
to
the
allottee,
but
the
allottee
is
an
indian?
is
that
land
still
indian
country?
justice
byron

white
so,
when
you
refer
to
indian
country,
you
are
not
referring
to
fee
lands
owned
outright
by
individual
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
this
case
only
concerns
indians
that
are
living
on
trust
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
what
the
state
is...
you
think
that
if
they're
living
off
the
trust
lands,
the
state
may--
justice
byron
r.
white
--impose
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
are
not
living
on
trust
lands
who
are
working
for
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
are
at
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
about
tribal
members
who
do
not
live
on
trust
land,
but
who
are
working
for
the
tribe
but
does
the
same...
you
run
into
the
same
problem
about
the
automobile
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you're
a
tribal
member,
the
state
has
no
barrier
to
insisting
on
their
paying
the
excise
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
tribe
say
about
people
who
don't
work
for
the
tribe,
but
who
live
on
indian
country
and
go
off
and
buy
an
automobile?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
on
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
claim
that
indians
who
live
on
trust
lands,
but
who
don't
work
for
the
tribe,
and...
but
live
off
of
trust
lands,
away
from
trust
lands...
do
they
claim
that
the
state
may
not
tax
those
indians...
income
tax
those
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
lives
on
the
trust
lands--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
works
off
of
trust
lands.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
for
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
issue
in...
is
that
at
issue
in
this
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
--among
other
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
mcclanahan,
what
if
that
person
who
lived
on
the
reservation,
the
navajo
reservation,
earned
his
or
her
income
off
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there...
did
mcclanahan
rule
that
or
another
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
some
other
case?
if
some
other
case
did,
i
would
think
it
would
control--
justice
byron
r.
white
--control
the
issue
in
this
case
of
indians
who
lived
on
trust
land,
but
who
were
earned
their
income
off
trust
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
--mescalero
case?
mescalero
held
that
if
a
tribe
sets
up
a
business
off
the
reservation,
it's
subject
to
the
state
gross
receipts
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suppose
that
would
cover...
that
would
control
a
case
of
an
individual
indian
working
off
the
reservation
earning
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
i'm
talking
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--an
individual
indian,
and
certainly
the
tribe
is
located
on
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
individual
indian
living
on
the
reservation
goes
off
the
reservation
that's
his...
and
his
regular
work
place,
where
he
earns
income,
is
not
on
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
mean
if
working
for
the
tribe
is
a...
was
a
big
factor
in
the
decision
below,
which
you
think
it
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
does
it
mean
working
for
the
tribe
in
terms
of
residence?
to
work
for
the
tribe,
do
you...
does
it...
do
they
have
to
work
on
indian
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that,
but
are
those
the
only
people
who
can
be
said
to
be
working
for
the
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
the
tribe
on
the
800
acres
that
it
was
allotted...
and
it's
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
tribe
can
control
who
is
permitted
to
enter
that
piece
of
trust
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
pretty
big,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could...
they
can
put
of
a
fence
around
the
whole
thing,
can't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
isn't
it
dedicated
to
their
exclusive
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
how
does
that
differ
from
the
notion
that
some
person
who
lives
and
works
and
earns
money
on
the
navajo
reservation
is
not
subject
to
state
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not,
but
you
just
said
that
it...
you
just
said
that
the
tribe
has
complete
control
of
this
land
and
can
keep
people
off
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
where
did
that
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
come
from
state
law
apparently.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
comes
from
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
maybe
the
allotment
act
didn't
expressly
provide
for
it,
but
somewhere
under
the
atmosphere,
you
say
federal
law
gives
the
tribe
complete
control
of
that
land,
that
800
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
difference
between
the
navajo
reservation
example
i
just
gave
you
and
this
is
that
it's
very
likely
that
most
of
the
indians,
or
is
it...
very
likely
that
most
of
the
indians
who
work
for
the
tribe
on
their
800
acres
do
not
live
on
the
800
acres?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you
just
at
the
outset--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
support
and
defend
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
never...
you
don't
know
of
any
case
that
says
that
oklahoma
automatically
does
that
for
the
person
who
is
taxed
by
an
indian
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
view
if
they
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
don't
live
on
the...
they
work
for
the
tribe
on
indian
country,
but
they
live
off
of
it.
what's
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
wouldn't
say
the
state
had
to
give
that
kind
of
a
credit
under
federal
law.
it
just
so
happens
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kneedler,
you
said
there
were
two
theories.
you've
given...
you've
gone
over
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--property
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
territorial,
and
what's--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
your
second
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
a
while
ago
if
the
tribal
member
is
living
off
of...
is
not
living
on
the
trust
land,
the
state
could
tax
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
business
of
interference
with
tribal
self-government
is
sort
of
common
law,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
courts
have
been
making
it
up,
including--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
the
courts
have
been...
i
don't...
do
you
read
it
in
some
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it's
common
law
and
the
courts
have
been
making
it
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be,
but
that
was
a
court
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
second
theory
would
touch
upon
the
automobile
excise
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
just
be
territorial,
but
you
would
say
that
the
state
may
not
put
the
excise
tax
on
indians
who
are
living
in
what
kind
of
a
community
did
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
some
other...
are
there
prior
cases
covering
the
situation
about
a
state
trying
to
tax
a
member
of
a
tribe
who
does
not
live
in
indian
country,
but
works
in
indian
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
indian
country.
you
mean
if
he's
working
in
indian
country--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
if
he's
living
in
indian
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
that
cover
the
automobiles
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
drive
his
own
car
up
there
without
being
taxed
by
a
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
the
key
in
your
view
is
where
the
person
works,
not
where
the
person
lives?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
have
no...
but
you've
got
no...
we
haven't
got
any
square
cases
on
that,
living
off
the
reservation,
but
working
on.
a
while
ago
you
said--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
the
cases
you
mentioned,
the
kansas
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
who
did
you
mention?
the
kansas
case
and
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
were
living
on
and
working
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
living
in
indian
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
stayed
and
continued
to
live
off
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
position
is
that
the
same
rule
ought
to
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
the
territorial
rationale
doesn't
exactly
work
out,
but
i
suppose
you
would
argue
with
the
federal
government
that
perhaps
it's
an
interference
with
tribal
self-government.
justice
byron
r.
white
taxing--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
give
us
a
citation
of
the
kansas
and
new
york
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
72,
767?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rice,
did
i
gather
you
said
that
the
state
may
not
only
not
tax
indians
who
live
off
indian
country
and
work
on
indian
country,
but
they
also
may
not
tax
non-indians
who
live
off
the
indian
country
and
work
on
indian
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
there's
a
non-indian
who
lives
off
the
reservation
or
lives
off
indian
country,
but
works
on
indian
country.
maybe
that's
just
a
figment
of...
maybe
that's
just...
because
it
may
be
that
nobody
who's
a
non-indian
ever
gets
to
work
on--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
so,
what's
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
non-indian
living
off
but
working
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
can
either
say
the
state
may
tax
him
or
may
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
tenth
circuit
decide
against
you
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
said.
against
you.
they
decided
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
denied
cert
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so,
that
isn't
at
issue
here.
we
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
brought
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
brought
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you...
and
was
part
of
your
claim
that
the
reservation
had
never
been--
justice
byron
r.
white
--destroyed?
and
none
of
the
lower
courts
decided
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
lost
half
your...
you
lost
some
of
your
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
and
we
denied
cert.--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
it
might
have
come
out
differently
if
they
had
decided
that
the
reservation
had
not
been
abolished.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
your
bright
line
rule
i
think
would
cover
indians
who
live
on
indian
country
and
work
on
indian
country,
but
it
doesn't
cover
indian...
tribal
members
who
don't
live
in
indian
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--none
of
the
cases
just
cover...
clearly
cover
that,
and
you
indicated
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
didn't
know
of
any
case
that
covered
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
talking
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--we're
talking
about
income
taxes.
but
your
bright
line
rule...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it...
would
cover
the
operation
of
a
commercial
activity,
not
just
working
for
the
government.
if
they
ran
a
casino,
for
example,
in
indian
company...
country,
even
though
it's
on
a
reservation,
but
as
long
as
it's
in
indian
country,
that...
the
bright
line
rule
would
protect
the
income
from
the
casino--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
tribe
is
running
a
business
off...
out
of
indian
country,
i
suppose
mescalero
controls.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
indian...
suppose
the
reservation...
even
if
the
reservation
wasn't
formally
abolished,
all
of
the
land,
other
than
that
which
has
been
held
in
trust
and
allotted
to
indians,
all
of
that
has
already
been
patented
to
non-indians
or
to
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
be...
you
might
say,
well,
here's
where
the
reservation
used
to
be,
but
there's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
you
could
exclude
anybody
you
wanted
to
any...
within
the
bounds
of
the
old
reservation
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
if
the
reservation
were
still
there
and
was
not
abolished,
you
wouldn't
say
that
every
acre
of
ground
within
the
bounds
of
the
reservation
would
be
indian
country.
