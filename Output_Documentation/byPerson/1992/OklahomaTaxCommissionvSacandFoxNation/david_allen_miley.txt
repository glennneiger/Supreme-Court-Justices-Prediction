mr.
david
allen
miley
thank
you,
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
whether
the
state
of
oklahoma
may
tax
the
income
of
a
tribal
member
who
is
employed
by
the
tribe,
the
sac
and
fox
nation,
and
whether
oklahoma
may
impose
motor
vehicle
taxes
on
automobiles
owned
by
tribal
members
of
the
sac
and
fox
nation.
the
sac
and
fox
nation
imposes
its
own
income
and
motor
vehicle
taxes,
as
the
state
does.
the
lower
courts
have
enjoined
the...
oklahoma
from
collecting
these
taxes,
and
the
state
feels
that
this
injunction
is
improper
for
two
reasons.
there
is
no
federal
law
which
preempts
state
law
in
this
area,
and
the
state
law--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--this
involves
state
taxation
of
tribal
members,
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
who...
some
of
the
tribal
members
live
on
indian
country
and
some
do
not
live
on
indian
country.
mr.
david
allen
miley
all
tribal
members.
we
were
enjoined
from
taxing
all
tribal
members
who
worked
for
the
tribe
or
any
tribal
members
who
properly
license
their
car
with
the
tribe.
and
those
tribal
members,
some
live
off
the
indian
country
and
some
live
on
indian
country.
of
course,
we
have
a
situation
where
indian
country
is
scattered
among
several...
is
scattered
among
small
plots
in
an
area
that
is
otherwise
under
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that
would
be
trust
land,
that
is,
land
that
is
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
of
america
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
itself
or
for
the
benefit
of
an
indian
tribal--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--an
individual
person.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes,
they
would
be
or
they'd
be
held
under
an
allotment
deed,
but
the
allotment
deeds
are
quite
old.
but
mainly
we're
talking
about
trust
land,
but
we
are
talking
about
allotted
land
also
in
this
area.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
under
the
federal
definition
under
the
federal
statute,
18
u.s.c.,
section
1151(c),
that
land...
an
indian
allotment
is
included
in
the
term.
mr.
david
allen
miley
the
government.
mr.
david
allen
miley
now,
that's
true.
it
could
be...
an
original
allottee
may
have
transferred
that
or
it
may
have
been
devised
to
a
non-indian--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--and
bia--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct.
if
the
bia--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct.
and
it
has
to
be...
most
land
we're
talking
about
is
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
if
the
indian
tribal
member
owns
deed
land,
just
the
fee
title
to
the
land,
and
there
is
no
trust
or
restricted
status
to
the
land,
then
that
would
not
be
indian
country
just
because
the
indian
would
own
it.
mr.
david
allen
miley
correct.
and
even
fee
lands
that
are
owned
by
the
tribe
itself
would
not
be
indian
country.
that
land
would
have
to
be
accepted
into
trust
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
many
times...
and
tribes
do
in
oklahoma
acquire
parcels
of
land
and
hold
it
in
fee.
bia
has
complete
discretion
whether
to
accept
that
land
in
the
trust
if
the
tribe
requests
it.
sometimes
the
bia
accepts
it
into
trust,
and
sometimes
the
bia
does
not.
so,
it
must
be
held
in
trust
to
be
indian
country.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
i
don't
think
the
distinction...
we
can
make
a
distinction.
but
if
i
lose
with
respect
to
the
indians
on
the
trust
lands,
that
would
have
to
be
because
they
are
within
some
sort
of
tribal
jurisdiction
that
is
exclusive
of
state
jurisdiction
so
that
outside
of
that
territory
on
non-indian
country
lands,
then
the
state
of
oklahoma
would
have
complete
jurisdiction
over
that
individual.
and
we're
talking
about
the
taxation
of
an
individual
person,
not
the
tribe.
mr.
david
allen
miley
correct,
but--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
here
the
tribe
does
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
because
i
think
we've
got
to
look
at
the
federal
statute,
the
relevant
federal
statute,
so
that
in
this
case
even
on
indian
country
within
oklahoma,
individuals
living
on
indian
country
are
taxable
by
the
state
in
oklahoma.
now,
that
is
because
the
allotment
agreement,
if
we...
which
is
the
mcclanahan
case,
set
up
the
idea
that...
that
case
dealt
with
the
navajo
reservation
in
arizona.
and
that
navajo
reservation
was
set
up
exclusively
for
the
tribe,
and
the
tribe
was
allowed
to
exclude
non-indians
or
impose
conditions
on
those
that
were
allowed
to
enter.
here
the
sac
and
fox
nation
did
have
a
reservation
which
was
established
about
the
same
time,
in
the...
1867,
about
the
same
time
the
navajo
reservation
was
established.
however,
in
1891,
the
federal
government...
congress
passed
the
allotment
agreement
or
enacted
the
allotment
agreement
which
allotted
all
the
lands
of
the
reservation
to
the
tribal
members
at
that
time.
mr.
david
allen
miley
the
tribe
got
about
800
acres.
mr.
david
allen
miley
this
is
a
fairly...
this
was
a
fairly
large
reservation
in
central
oklahoma.
but
even
giving
acreage
to
the
tribe,
even
giving
a
quarter
section
to
each
tribal
member,
they
had
huge
amounts
of
land
left
over,
and
they
opened
that
up.
president
harrison
opened
that
up
to
the
legendary
land
runs
and
all
people
of
all
kinds
came
in
and
took
the
land.
and
the
tribe
was
not
allowed
to
exclude
those
or
impose
any
conditions
on
them.
and
so,
implicit
in
the
terms
of
that
allotment
agreement,
the
relevant
statute
in
this
case,
we
find
that
the
tribe
has
lost
the
autonomy
that
the
navajo
nation
has.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
it
concerns--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct.
these
are
tribal
members
who
work
for
the
tribe.
now,
i
think
many
tribal
members
don't
work
for
the
tribe.
mr.
david
allen
miley
they
work
for--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--various
places,
and
they...
there
is
no
argument
that
they
are
taxable,
but
here
we
have
tribal
members--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--who
are
working
for
the
tribe,
and
some--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--they
are
at
issue
because
the
lower
courts
held
that
if
you...
if
the
indian
or
the
tribal
member
works
for
the
tribe,
they
do
not
owe
taxes.
period.
mr.
david
allen
miley
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
allen
miley
that's
correct.
the
way
the
tribal
scheme
is
set
up...
well,
you
don't
even
have
to
be
a
tribal
member
to
get
a
tribal
tag
necessarily.
mr.
david
allen
miley
but
the--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--right.
yes,
in
terms
of
our
own
taxes,
we
feel
that
even
though
you
pay
tribal
taxes
in
either
instance,
you
owe
the
state
taxes
also.
now,
so
we're
talking
about
the
tribal
members
on
indian
country
and
off
that
are
tagging
their
cars
with
the
tribe.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well.
i
think
this
case
started
out
much
broader,
and
the
tribe
would
argue
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i
would
argue
that...
well,
and
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
see
it
so
broadly.
they
felt
that
in
order...
in
this
circumstance,
where
we
do
not
have
this
exclusive
type
statute,
that
the
fact
that
they
were
working
for
the
tribe
was
the
deciding
factor
as
to
whether
they
were
taxable
or
not
because
our
tax
somehow
infringed
on
tribal
self-government.
mr.
david
allen
miley
okay,
but
this
case
does
not
fall
very
neatly
into
the
on/off
dichotomy
because
people
are
constantly
going
on
and
off
the
indian
country
because
you
cannot
conduct
your
daily
affairs
of
life
in
oklahoma
on
strictly
indian
country.
you
have
got
to
proceed
outside
of
indian
country
to
do
that
because
you've
got
160
acres
of
indian
country
here
and
160
acres
down
the
road.
and
so,
if
you're
living
on
indian
country,
you're
necessarily
going
to
have
to
go
off
to
take
care
of
any
business.
so,
you
have...
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
indians
are
going
off
indian
country
to
work
and
to
shop.
and
what
the
tribe
is
saying
in
this
instance
is,
well,
if
they
work
for
us,
they
don't
owe
any
taxes,
and
if
they
happen
to
buy
something
that
they're
going
to
take
back
to
indian
country
like
a
car,
then
they
don't
owe
taxes
either.
well,
that--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
they
would
say
that
just
because
they
live
on
indian
country,
they're
within
the
tribal
jurisdiction,
you
see,
and
that
they
would
not
be
responsible
for--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--on
income
tax--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--okay,
now,
income
for
a
person
who...
a
tribal
member
who
lives
off
of
indian
country?
mr.
david
allen
miley
who
lives
on.
mr.
david
allen
miley
works
off
of
trust
lands.
mr.
david
allen
miley
not
for
the
tribe.
okay.
they
would
argue
that
because
the
person
lives
on
indian
country,
that
that
would
be
exempt
from
state
taxation.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
no.
the
tenth
circuit--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--the
tenth
circuit
did
not...
the
tenth
circuit
ruled
that
only
those
tribal
members
who
work
for
the
tribe
were
eligible
for
this
exemption
in
this
case
because
i
believe
they
were
having
a
little
trouble
with
the
fact
that
we
can't
find
an
existing
reservation
here.
for
instance,
in
the
mcclanahan
case,
the
tribal
member
did
not
work
for
the
tribe
in
that
case.
she
lived
on
the
reservation.
she
worked
on
the
reservation.
she
earned
all
her
income
on
the
reservation,
and
because
the
federal
government,
in
their
statute
that
created
the
navajo
reservation,
granted
the
tribe
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
that
land--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--the
state
was
not
allowed
to
come
in
and
tax
her.
well,
the
tenth
circuit
couldn't
quite
get
there
with
that
case
because
we
have
the
situation
of
the
allotment
agreement.
mr.
david
allen
miley
off
the
reservation,
they...
i
believe
it's...
in
arizona
they
would
pay
the
state
income
taxes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
mcclanahan
did
not--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--did
not
hold
that.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no,
i--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
i
can't
think
of
a
case
right
offhand
that--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--does
that.
mr.
david
allen
miley
but
in
terms
of
the
income
tax
here,
i
believe
this
court
has
already
ruled...
well,
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
in
the
1930's
that...
in
the
case
of
leahy
v.
state
treasurer,
which
relied
on
choteau
v.
burnet,
where
you
had
the
situation
of
an
indian,
an
osage
indian,
who
lived
on
indian
country
and
earned
income
from
the
tribal
mineral
resources,
and
he
was
taxable
on
the
income
that
he
earned
on
those
tribal
mineral
resources
in
that
case
because
there
was
not
this
type
of
reservation
that
you
have
in
the
navajo
cases.
and
then
coming
a
few
years
later
in
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
u.s.,
the
supreme
court
also
ruled
that
members
of
the
five
civilized
tribes
would
owe
oklahoma
estate
taxes
on
their
estates
which
included
indian
country,
where
they
lived,
their
homestead
allotments.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
i
don't--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
i
don't
think
i
agree
with
your
reasoning
that
you've
got
to
have
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
whole
basis
of
the
mcclanahan
case
was
that
the
navajo
treaty
preempted
state
law.
and
so,
in
this
case,
we
have
an
allotment
agreement
that
did
away
with
that
exclusive
treaty
and
implies
that
state
law
now
applies,
and
we
have
cases,
supreme
court
cases,
that
suggest...
that
i
believe
are
applicable
to
this
situation,
that
conclude
that
state
law,
state
tax
law,
does
apply
for
an
individual's
income.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes,
i
do.
mr.
david
allen
miley
so,
i
think,
though,
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
lower
courts
did
not...
declined
to
do
was
resolve
the
reservation
issue
of
whether
what...
to
what
extent
the
reservation
exists,
and
i
believe
that
is
a
necessary
part
of
a
finding
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion,
if
in
fact
state
law
infringes
on
tribal
self-government,
you've
got
to
find
the
reservation
where
it
is
acting
on,
and
i
think
you'd
have
to
have
an
exclusive
reservation
in
order
to...
if
in
fact
the
state
law
will
be
an
infringement
on
the
tribal
government
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
think
that
was
what
congress
intended
when
they
passed
the
allotment
agreement.
i
think
we've
got
to
give
the
allotment
agreement
as
broad
a
sweep
as
the
congress
intended
that
passed
the
act,
and
in
that
case,
they
were
terminating
the
reservations
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
to,
in
fact,
create
the
state.
and
i
think
it...
in
reading
in
the
accounts
in
the
case
of
the
case
that
i
cited,
woodward
v.
degraffenried--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--correct.
in
that
case--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
that's
correct.
it
would.
and
i
think
that
case
did
rely
on
the
earlier
oklahoma
cases
to
some
extent.
i...
the
mescalero
case,
however,
dealt
with
a
tribe
off
of
a
reservation--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--and
an
individual--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--on
the
reservation.
mr.
david
allen
miley
correct.
so,
in
that
case,
that
case,
as
well
as
earlier
cases,
like
ward
v.
racehorse,
hold
that
when
indians
leave
indian
country,
they're
subject
to
state
law
as
all
other
persons
are.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
in
this
case,
the
headquarters
building
is
on
indian
country.
mr.
david
allen
miley
i
believe
some
employees
would
probably
perform
some
duties
off
of
indian
country
in
this
case.
so,
i...
yes,
there
could
a
situation
where
you
would
have
an
employee
that
would
be
working
off
of
indian
country
for
the
tribe.
most
definitely.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well,
in
that
case,
i
believe
it
stands
for
the
fact
that
when
indians
within
oklahoma...
the
tribes
do
not
have
the
autonomy
that
reservation
tribes
in
other
states
do.
i
think
the
court
in
that
case
was
recognizing
the
fact
that
indian
governments
do
exist
in
oklahoma.
indian
country
does
exist
in
oklahoma,
but
that's
not
the
determining
factor.
that's
not
what
we're
trying
to
determine
here.
we're
trying
to
determine
what...
how
congress
treated
these
tribes.
they
did
not
give
these
tribes
the
exclusive
autonomous
situation
that
they
gave
the
navajos.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes,
i
did.
mr.
david
allen
miley
they
did
not
deal
with
it
in
their
opinion.
i
believe
it
is
fairly
much
squarely
opposed
to
their
opinion
in
my
view.
so,
they
instead
relied
on
the
later
case
of
mcclanahan
to
support
their
position.
but
i
think
the
problem
with,
you
know,
relying
on
the
mcclanahan
case
is
that
they
quoted
the
language
in
mcclanahan
that
said
the
federal
statute
requires
that
the
state
law
be
excluded
in
this
area,
and
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
point
to
any
federal
statute
that
excludes
law
for
oklahoma
in
regards
to
the
sac
and
fox
nation.
i
think
that
relevant
statute
is
the
allotment
agreement
and
it
does...
nothing
in
that
allotment
agreement
would
presume
to
exclude
state
law.
i
think
it
was
the
intent
of
that
agreement
to
terminate
the
reservations
and
to
include
state
law.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
as
much
as
any
private
landowner
would,
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
uh-huh.
mr.
david
allen
miley
right.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes,
it
is,
but--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well,
the
federal
statute
that
allotted
the
land
to
the
tribe
in
this
case
did
not
provide
that
there
would
be
any
type
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
this
tribe.
mr.
david
allen
miley
well--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--well--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--no.
it
came
from--
mr.
david
allen
miley
--federal
law.
yes.
mr.
david
allen
miley
yes,
that
800
acres,
subject
to
the...
you
know,
bia's
oversight.
mr.
david
allen
miley
correct.
mr.
david
allen
miley
no.
well,
this...
under...
with
this
indian
country,
they
would
be
subject
to
the
bia's
oversight
as
far
as
what
they
want
to
do
with
the
land.
certainly
they
would
have
to
get
approval
for
those
types
of
things.
so,
it
is
kind
of...
in
that
sense
that
it
would
be
under
more
federal
jurisdiction
i
believe.
mr.
david
allen
miley
most
likely
they
do
not.
mr.
david
allen
miley
thank
you.
