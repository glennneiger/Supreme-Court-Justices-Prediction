it
seems
to
me,
mr.
kneedler,
in
that
case
the
tribe
could
tax
them
100
percent,
and
then
get
a
100
percent
deduction
from
their...
because
they
all
work
for
the
tribe.
so,
the
income
is
paid
by
the
tribe
to
them.
then
take
some
of
it
back
in
the
form
of
taxes.
could
they
just
tax
100
percent
and
then
say
that
we
want
a
credit
from
the
state
income
for
that
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
50--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
would
that
theory
apply
equally
to
a
nonmember
employed
by
the
tribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
tell
me
just
a
little
bit
more
about
the
nation
itself?
this
800
acres,
is
that...
that's
trust
land
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
trust
for
the
tribe
or
for
individual
indians?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
roughly
how
many...
how
big
is
the
nation?
how
many
indians
live
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
some
of
them
live
on
the
800.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
800
acres
primarily
used
for?
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
is
there
a
large
number
of
employees
working
for
the
tribal
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
took
all
of
the
employees
of
the
tribe
together,
how
many
people
would
we
be
talking
about
roughly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
quite
a
group,
yes.
and
most
of
them,
if
not
all,
live
on
the...
on
indian
country.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
discover
an
oil
well
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
