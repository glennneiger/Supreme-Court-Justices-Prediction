mr.
g.
william
rice
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
by
straightforward
application
of
this
court's
per
se
rule
and
the
rules
of
stare
decisis.
the
court
has
ruled
previously
in
several
cases,
in
which
the
court
did
not
recognize
that
there
was
an
existing
indian
reservation,
that
state
taxes,
at
least
as
to
tribal
members
within
indian
country
were
not
applicable.
those
cases
include
rickert,
the
kansas
indians,
the
new
york
indians,
several
other
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
now,
the
state
would
have
you
believe
that
the
tribe
here
is
totally
subject
to
state
law,
that
the
indian
reservation
of
the
sac
and
fox
nation
was
abolished
back
in
1891,
and
that
the
tribe
is
not
a
tribe
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word.
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
those
are
true.
now,
the
per
se
rule
that
this
court
has
developed
has
been
applied
in
the
early
cases
i
just
mentioned.
in
montana
v.
blackfeet,
the
state...
the
court
said
that
the
states
may
tax
indians
only
when
congress
has
manifested
clearly
its
consent.
that
is
clearly
a
different
analysis,
a
different
type
of
rule,
than
the
state
would
bring
forward
here
where
they
say
the
question
is
not
has
congress
said
they...
oklahoma
can
tax
the
tribe.
they're
trying
to
advance
the
theory
that
the
state
may
tax
unless
congress
has
said
they
cannot,
and
as
that
court
has
simply
said...
as
the
court
has
simply
said
that's--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
exactly
on
point.
mr.
g.
william
rice
my
position
on
that
is
that
the
line,
if
you
will,
or
the
bright
line
rule
that
should
be
applicable
here,
is
the
indian
country
line.
what
we
have
is--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
william
rice
if
he's
working
in
indian
country.
the
action
of
the
indian
inside
the
indian
country
should
be
the
determining
question.
it's
basically
the
opposite
of
mescalero
apache
tribe
v.
jones.
mr.
g.
william
rice
it
covers
the
individual,
for
instance,
who
would
go
to
a
automobile
dealership
and
have
a
car
delivered
to
him
and
title
transferred
within
the
indian
country.
that's
central
machinery
v.
arizona
tax
commission.
that
exact
thing
happened
in
that
case,
only
it
was
a
tractor
dealership
who
was
being
taxed
on
a
gross
receipts
tax,
which
is
kind
of
an
income
tax.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
when
he
brings
that
automobile
from
the
reservation
or
from
his
allotment
back
out,
let's
say,
to
norman
outside
the
indian
reservation,
outside
the
indian
country,
at
that
point,
since
he's
a
resident
there,
he
becomes
obligated
to
pay
the
state
tax
there.
if
he
bought
that
piece
of
property
to
leave
it
in
the
indian
country
and,
you
know,
to
operate
it
there...
and
the
good
example,
the
classic
example,
is
the
individual
who
spends
the
summers
in
colorado
and
works
back
home
during
the
school
year
as
an
educator,
for
instance.
if
he
leaves
all
his
furniture,
his
car,
et
cetera
on
his
allotment
within
the
sac
and
fox
indian
country
during
the
school
year,
that's
between
him
and
the
tribe.
that's
what
is
set
aside
by
the
whole
indian
country
concept
to
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government.
on
the
other
hand,
when
it
comes
may
and
he
gets
out
of
school
and
he
flies
up
to
colorado
and
picks
up
that
car,
now
he
owes
state
taxes
on
that
car.
mr.
g.
william
rice
he
could,
sir.
mr.
g.
william
rice
the
key...
excuse
me...
the
key
is
the
conduct
of
the
indian
in
the
indian
country.
the
indian
country
has
always
been
defined
by
congress
by
court
decision
as
that
area
that's
set
aside
for
tribal
self-government
for
indian
occupancy
and
indian
use.
that
has
been
the
theory
behind
the
concept
of
indian
country
from
the
beginning
days--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
g.
william
rice
it's
the
converse
of
mescalero
v.
jones.
mr.
g.
william
rice
the
kansas
indians
and
the
new
york
indians.
now,
if
you
say
the
indian--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--what
we
had
there
was
a
situation
where
the
tribe's
reservations
had
been
abolished.
mr.
g.
william
rice
and
the
claim
made
there
was
basically
the
same
claim
that's
being
made
here.
these
indians
are
assimilated
into
the
state
community
and
you
can't
tell
the
difference
and
so
forth.
the
court
came
back
and
said
no.
as
long
as
the
political
branches
of
the
government,
as
long
as
the
congress
and
the
executive
recognize
these
as
a
people
with
the
tribal
government,
having
the
right
to
make
and
enforce
their
own
laws
and
maintaining
a
governmental
relationship
with
the
united
states,
they're
outside
the
authority
of
the
state
to
levy
taxes
even
though
their
reservation
had
been
abolished--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--i
believe
that
they
were.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i
mean,
that's
the
outgrowth
of
those
cases.
and
that's
why
i
said
i
don't
know...
excuse
me...
offhand
of
a
clear
case
where
an
indian
was
outside
the
indian
country
and
came
in
and
went
to
work
in
the
indian
country.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that's
correct.
mr.
g.
william
rice
my
position
is
the
same
rule
of
mcclanahan
should
apply
because
what
mcclanahan,
when
you
get
back
to
page
179
and
180
of
the
opinion
down
at
the
bottom,
basically
says
that
this
person
was
an
indian
and
the
income
they
earned
came
from
the
indian
reservation.
and
i
think
those
are
really
the
two
penultimate
issues
in
mcclanahan,
is
the
person
an
indian,
and
did
they
earn
it
in
the
indian
country.
mr.
g.
william
rice
insofar
as--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--the
use
of
a
tax
could
be
used
to
regulate
conduct,
i
believe
yes,
it
is.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i
believe
that
any
income
that
an
indian
earns
in
the
indian
country
is
exempt
from
state
taxation.
mr.
g.
william
rice
the
position
is
that
the
property
has
to
be
garaged,
located
in
the
indian
country.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i
believe
it
would
be...
could
be.
mr.
g.
william
rice
the
kansas
indians,
your
honor,
is
72
u.s.
667,
and
the
new
york
indians
follows
that
immediately.
mr.
g.
william
rice
72
united
states
667.
as
previously
indicated,
the
court
has
adopted
a
per
se
rule
against
the
taxation
of
indians
in
the
indian
country.
i
think
simple
straightforward
application
of
that
rule
resolves
this
case.
the
per
se
rule,
as
it
was
stated
last
term
in
county
of
yakima
v.
yakima...
and
this
has
been
stated
in
california
v.
cabazon
and
montana
v.
blackfeet...
is
really
a
penultimate
outgrowth
of
the
preemption
rule
of
federal
preemption.
the
problem
here
is
that
we're
trying
to
apply
the
allotment
agreement
in
a
vacuum.
it's
as
if
the
first
time
there's
a
relationship
between
the
sac
and
fox
nation
and
the
united
states
came
about
in
the
allotment
agreement.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
there
has
been
a
treaty
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
sac
and
fox
nation
since
1789.
the
early
treaties
between
the
sac
and
fox
nation
and
the
united
states
are
exactly
the
same
type
of
treaties
that
worcester
v.
georgia
held
to
preempt
all
state
action
by
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
the
court
has
gone
then
from
a
per
se
rule
to
a
preemption
analysis
and
has
come
back,
at
least
in
the
tax
situations,
to
the
per
se
rule.
the
thing...
one
thing
that
is
happening
here
that
i
think
is
important
in
this
context
is
the
redevelopment
or
the
reaffirmation
by
congress,
if
you
will,
of
the
rights
to
tribal
self-government,
and
i
refer
specifically
to
the
sac
and
fox
nation's
self-governance
grant
and
compact
that
they
have
entered
into
now
with
the
united
states
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult
to
identify
what
the
indian
country
is.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that's
a
fairly
a
simple
analysis
based
on
18
u.s.c.
1151.
mr.
g.
william
rice
you
can
identify
a
reservation,
a
dependent
indian
community,
or
an
indian
allotment,
and
you
immediately
know
where
that
is.
mr.
g.
william
rice
okay.
mr.
g.
william
rice
well,
no
more
than
you
would
if
you
were
selling
things
inside
the
state
and
outside
the
state,
for
instance.
you
would...
or
the
same
type
of
situation
occurs
when
you
have
taxable
income
and
nontaxable
income.
you
simply
report
that
part
that's
taxable
to
the
state
of
oklahoma,
and
you
report
that
part
that's
taxable
to
the
sac
and
fox
nation.
mr.
g.
william
rice
well,
it's
not
really
a
case
i
think
of
driving
in
and
out
of
the
indian
country
all
the
time.
the
more
rational
situation
is
going
to
be
where
you
have
a
fellow
who
works
all
day,
for
instance,
at
the
tribal
office,
drives
back
to
a
area
outside
of
the
indian
country
and
goes
to
a
second
job
in
the
evening
as
a
checker
at
the
grocery
store
or,
you
know,
some
other
type
of
employment.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
any
trouble
at
all
to
decide
what
part
of
that
income
goes
to
the
state
authority
and
which
one
doesn't.
and
that's
the
straw
man
really
is
the
mcclanahan...
roselyn
mcclanahan
who
works
for
the
navajo
legal
services
during
the
daytime,
is
not
taxable
on
that
income,
and
yet
if
she
drives
over
to
gallup
off
of
the
reservation
and
works
an
evening
job,
then
under
the
mcclanahan
rule,
i
presume
she's
taxable
on
the
income
that
she
earned
at
gallup.
and
that's
the
case
that's
going
to
come
up.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
the
question.
mr.
g.
william
rice
no.
there
are
some
that
work
there.
mr.
g.
william
rice
well--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--i
think
there's
two
answers
to
that.
one
is--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--well,
i
think
the
state
may
not
tax
him
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
as
long
as
he
is
working
for
the
tribe
or
engaged
in
conduct
which
is
subject
to
regulation
and
if
the
state
interferes
by
taxing
him
with
tribal
self-government
to
the
point
that
they
are
trying
to
use
their
tax
to
regulate
conduct--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--no,
they
did
not.
they
decided
that
adversely
to
us.
mr.
g.
william
rice
yes.
mr.
g.
william
rice
you
denied
cert
on
that.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that's
the
position
that
we
had
because
of
the
treaties
and
the
other.
now,
in
addition
to
the
per
se
rule
and
the
preemption,
we
also
have
the
stare
decisis
questions.
mcclanahan
squarely
holds
that
indians,
i
think,
in
the
indian
country
are
not
subject
to
state
income
tax.
moe
v.
confederated
salish
&
kootenai
and
washington
v.
the
colville
tribes
provide
the
same
type
of
background
for
automobile
taxes.
the
taxes
here
are
property
taxes,
pure
and
simple.
they're
based
on
the
value
of
the
car.
the
oklahoma
courts,
as
shown
in
exhibits
18
and
27
through
32
in
the
tenth
circuit
exhibits,
have
ruled
against
the
tax
commission
on
exactly
this
issue.
it
was
interesting
in
the
solicitor
general's
letter
lodged
with
the
court
that
the
oklahoma
court
of
appeals
has
now
ruled
against
the
tax
commission
on
the
issue
of
the
income
tax
in
core
v.
oklahoma
tax
commission.
the
stare
decisis
situation
here
is
such
that
the
court
all...
really
just
needs
to
simply
apply
those
cases
to
this
situation.
those
cases
apply
in
the
indian
country,
and
since
they
are
applicable
in
the
indian
country
in
my
view,
the
court
need
go
no
further.
now,
if
the
court
chooses
to
take
the
next
step,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
the
original
boundaries
of
the
sac
and
fox
indian
reservation
have
been
extinguished,
and
that's
an
issue
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
tenth
circuit
chose
to
address.
it
would
be
our
position
in
that
case
that
you
could
either
remand
for
that
decision
or
you
could
go
ahead
and
decide
it
on
the
record
that's
here.
mr.
g.
william
rice
excuse
me?
mr.
g.
william
rice
the
nation
brought
this
suit,
the
sac
and
fox
nation.
mr.
g.
william
rice
yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
g.
william
rice
they
did
not
decide
that
issue
at
all.
the
reference
is
continuously
to
the
abolished
reservation
or
the
old
reservation
or
the
reservation
that's
not
there
anymore.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
no
court
has
ever
ruled
that
way.
that
was
part
of
the
complaint.
that
was
part
of
the
argument
all
the
way
up.
that
was
never
ruled
on.
the
courts
below
simply
did
what
we
said
is
the
only
thing
that
this
court
really
needs
to
do,
and
that
was
to
apply
the
per
se
rule
and
the
rules
of
stare
decisis
and
say
that
these
cases,
mcclanahan,
moe,
colville,
and
central
machinery,
apply,
pure
and
simple,
within
the
indian
country.
because
of
that,
we
have
indian
country
where
the
tribal
trust
land
is
because
all
our
reservation
has
ever
really
been
is
land
that
has
been
set
aside
under
the
superintendence
of
the
government
for
indians.
that's
what
our
reservation
turns
out
to
be.
we
have
dependent
indian
communities.
we
have
allotments
that
are
still
in
trust.
now,
because
we
have
that
situation,
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
reservation
boundary
issue.
we've
got
the
tribe
on
trust
land.
we've
got
most
of
the
people
that
work
there
on
trust
land,
and
we
can
let
the
reservation
boundary
issue
go--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
william
rice
no,
i
don't
think
under
their
analysis
that
it
would
have
come
out
any
differently--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--because
what
they
simply
said
is
they
drew
a
distinction
between
tribal
members
and
nontribal
members,
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
distinction
there.
mr.
g.
william
rice
it
wasn't
an
indian
country
decision.
mr.
g.
william
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that
is...
the
800
acres
is
land
which
was
explicitly
reserved
out
of
the
operation
of
the
allotment
agreement
by
the
agreement
itself.
mr.
g.
william
rice
it
was
to
be
held
as
the
tribal
land
had
always
been
held,
in
other
words,
under
the
1867
treaty.
mr.
g.
william
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
william
rice
about
2,500
members
of
the--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--they
don't
all
live
on
the
800
acres.
mr.
g.
william
rice
there's
a
few
of
them
that
do,
yes.
most
of
them
reside
on
allotments
or
around
the
original
reservation
area.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that
is
where
the
center
of
the
tribal
government
is,
the
tribal
administrative
offices.
everything
from
the
chief's
office
and
residence
down
to
the
pow-wow
grounds
is
on
that
800
acres--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--plus
a
couple
hundred
that
has
been
added
to
it.
mr.
g.
william
rice
most
of
them
work
there.
there's
about
90
tribal
employees
that
work
right...
you
know,
mostly
in
that
area.
now,
that
number
does
not
include
members
of
tribal
boards,
commissions,
agencies,
and--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--roughly
140
to
150
people.
mr.
g.
william
rice
i
would
say
the
large
majority
of
those
live
on
indian
country.
now,
we
are
i
suppose
back
to
the
bright
line
rule.
we
think
that
that
is
what
indian
country
is,
is
the
place
that
congress
has
set
aside
the
tribe,
if
you
will,
behind
the
law,
and
they
have
said
in
1151,
which
basically
codified
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
understanding
that
solicitor
cohen
had
in
his
handbook
of
indian
law
in
1942,
that
the
indian
country
is
the
place
for
tribal
self-government.
it's
a
place
where
state
law
only
applies
when
congress
says
that
it
does.
now,
that
has
been
the
concept
of
indian
country.
you
don't
have
to
decide
the
reservation
boundary
issues
to
decide
the
case
if
you
adopt
and
apply
the
mcclanahan,
moe,
colville
series
of
cases
through
stare
decisis
or
through
the
per
se
rule.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
do
not
apply
those
cases
to
the
indian
country
generally,
as
it
has
been
defined
by
congress
and
1151,
then
in
order
to
rule
against
the
tribe
on
the
part
of
the
case
on
which
certiorari
was
granted,
you
have
to
overrule
that
line
of
cases
because
it's
kind
of
an
either/or
proposition.
if
our
reservation
is
there,
then
those
cases
ought
to
apply.
if
those
cases
apply
to
all
indian
country,
regardless
of
reservation
status,
we
don't
have
to
get
to
that
issue,
but
if
the
reservation
is
there,
then
the
only
way
that
these
cases
don't
apply
would
be
to
overrule.
mr.
g.
william
rice
it
would
seem
to
me
it
covers
conduct
of
an
indian
in
the
indian
country.
mr.
g.
william
rice
and
let
me--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--well--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--not
in
the
income
tax
situation.
mr.
g.
william
rice
there
are
criminal
cases,
for
instance--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--or
other
cases.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
g.
william
rice
if
it's
the
indian
conduct
in
the
indian
country,
then
that
is
what
congress
has
put
behind
the
law.
mr.
g.
william
rice
that
would
be
mescalero.
if
the
tribe
chose
to
take
the
business
100
miles
away
from
its
indian
country,
and
the
united
states
does
not
put
that
in
trust
or
does
not
otherwise
take
action
that
would
make
it
indian
country,
then
that's
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
g.
william
rice
true.
mr.
g.
william
rice
well,
there's
still
a
real
solid
indian
presence
in
that
area,
and
i
think
we've
taken
the
position
in--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--well,
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
we
would
exclude
the
landowners,
no.
i
think
that
one
is
solved
in
montana
v.
the
united
states--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--and
a
couple
of
other
cases.
mr.
g.
william
rice
the
difference,
though,
with
the
indian
conduct
in
those
areas
that
have
still
retained
reservation
status
is
mattz
v.
arnett,
and
those
cases
say
that
the
indian
work...
the
indian
activity
there,
their
actions,
are
still
within
the
indian
country.
i
think
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
our
position
in
the
brief
and
here
also
is
that
there's
three
fallback
positions
basically
on
the
indian
country
issue.
one
of
those
is...
and
the
first
one
i
think
is
that
the
original
boundaries
are
still
there.
the
second
one
is
that
regardless...
if
you
read
the
allotment
agreement
and
the
legislative
history,
which
is
in
the
exhibits
that
were
in
the
tenth
circuit--
mr.
g.
william
rice
--we've
got
a
diminished
one,
not
a
big
one.
mr.
g.
william
rice
yes,
sir,
it
is
indian
country
because
1151(a)
says
that
it
includes
all
indian
reservations
notwithstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent,
and
seymour
v.
superintendent
says
a
patent
to
anybody,
whether
that's
a
patent
to
an
indian
or
a
patent
to
a
non-indian.
