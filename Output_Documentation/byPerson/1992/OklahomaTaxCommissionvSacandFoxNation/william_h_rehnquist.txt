what
do
you
understand
the

to
stand
for?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
cite
leahy
to
the
tenth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
they
deal
with
it
at
all
in
their
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said
it
had...
the
tribe
had
the
same
rights
as
a
private

have--
chief

from

--in
any
of

have
we
said
there
was
kind
of
a
dormant

commerce
clause?
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
we
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
it
interfere
with
tribal
self-government
to
have
them
pay
an
income
tax?
to
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
ruling
for
the
tribe
here
would
enable
them
to
keep
a
kind
of
a
cheap
labor
source.

h.
