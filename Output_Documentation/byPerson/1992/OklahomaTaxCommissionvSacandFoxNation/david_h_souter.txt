go
ahead.
if
you
should
lose
with
respect
to
indians
who
are
living
on
trust
lands,
should
you
also
lose
with
respect
to
those
who
are
not
living
on
trust
lands?
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
why
is
the
distinction
important?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you're
saying
the
criterion
strictly
is
a
territorial
jurisdiction
criterion,
and
therefore
you
would
not
have
to
lose
with
respect
to
those
nontrust
lands.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
other
competing
theory
of
jurisdiction?
