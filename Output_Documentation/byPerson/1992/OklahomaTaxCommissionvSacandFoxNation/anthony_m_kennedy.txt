justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
more
question
on
this
preliminary
part
of
your
argument.
if
we
rule
for
you...
pardon
me.
if
we
rule
against
you
on
your
point,
does
the
case
still
have
to
go
back
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
have
jurisdiction
to
tax
people
that
are
in
indian
country,
or
do
we
have
to...
we
can
remand
for
that,
can't
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
because
if
you
don't
have
civil
or
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indian
country--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
i
take
it
you
don't,
and
mcclanahan
says
that's
that
the
key
for
taxation,
and
if
the
tenth
circuit
didn't
reach
that,
we
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
do
we?
we
can
remand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
we
think
we
should
resolve
that
issue
here
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
