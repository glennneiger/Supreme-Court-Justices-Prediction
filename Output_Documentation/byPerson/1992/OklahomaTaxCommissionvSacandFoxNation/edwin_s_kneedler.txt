mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
possible
theories
of
immunity
from
state
taxation
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
they
were
the
ones
identified--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
its
entirety,
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
we...
there
are
two
possible
theories.
under
one
of
them,
the
territorial
theory,
essentially
the
principles
synthesized
by
this
court
in
mcclanahan,
we
think
the
court
was
mistaken.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
believe
that
it
was
sufficient
if
the
indian
earns
his
income
within
indian
country
irrespective
of
where
he
resides.
in
mcclanahan
itself,
however,
the
indian
both
lived
and
worked
on
the
indian
reservation.
it's
common
for
states...
and
oklahoma
is
one
of
these
states...
to
tax
income
on
the
basis
of
either
where
the
individual
resides
or
works,
and
as
long
as
that
statute
is
applied
in
an
evenhanded
manner,
the
territorial
principles,
mcclanahan
would
not
bar
the
tax
if
the
individual
either
resided
or
worked
off
the
reservation.
we
do
think
it's
significant,
however,
that
oklahoma
affords
a
credit
to
a
resident
who
works
in
another
state,
but
does
not
afford
a
comparable
credit
to
a
resident
who
works
for
the
indian
tribe.
so,
in
the
example
of
someone
who...
an
indian
who
lives
off
the
reservation,
but
works
on
the
reservation,
we
would
think
a
parallel
to
oklahoma's
own
state
taxing
scheme
would
suggest
that
a
credit
might
be
given.
and
that's...
that
is
we
think
something
that
could
be
decided
on
remand.
but
because
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's...
oklahoma's
own
tax
code
provides
that,
and
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
a
number
of
states
identifies
that
as
a
common
practice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oklahoma
does
not
do
that
for
an
indian
tribe.
and
we
think
this
case
should
be
remanded
because
the...
a
necessary
aspect
of
the
mcclanahan
analysis
is
where
the
individual
resides
and
works.
we
think
the
case
should
be
remanded
insofar
as
the
mcclanahan
analysis
is
concerned
to
determine
exactly
where
the
tribal
employees
do
live
and
work.
we
assume
that
most
of
the
tribal
employees
work
in
indian
country,
but
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
they--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
that
event,
we
believe
the
state
could
tax
them,
although
we
think
on
remand,
the
court
could
examine
this
question
of
whether
a
credit
should
be
given
for
the
income
tax
paid--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
the
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would...
i
think
general
indian
law
principles
in
the
indian
commerce
clause.
i
think
there's
a
relative
balancing
of
the
state
tribal
interests
in
a
situation
like
this,
and
in
a
situation
like
this
where...
particularly
where
the
individuals
are
employed
by
the
tribe
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
the...
i
think
there
may
be
some
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
indian--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
political
process
within
the
tribe
i
think
would
limit
the
amount
of
tax
on
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
there's
a
substantial
argument
that
it
should,
given
its
tax
structure
with
respect
to
off
reservation,
but
i
think
one
of
the
things
the
court
should
examine
is
the
extent
to
which
the
failure
to
give
that
credit
would
interfere
with
the...
with
tribal
self-government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
has
not
relied
on
the
indian
commerce
clause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
not
really
necessary
to
because
we
think
it's
sufficient
to
look
both
to
the
indian
country
status
of
the
land
at
issue...
and
it
is
indian
country
status,
not
reservation
status
that
we
think
is
the
starting
point
of
analysis
in
this
case...
and
look
at
the
question
of
whether
the
tribe
is...
whether
there's
tribal
self-government
actually
working
in
the
area,
whether
there
is
a
government-to-government
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
the
territorial
based
one.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
the
second
one--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
on
the
credit
point,
i
was
simply
saying
that
that's
a
common
accommodation
of
states,
both
of
who
have
some
territorial
jurisdiction.
i'm...
that's
what
i
was
suggesting
on
the
credit.
on
the
interference
with
tribe
self-government
point,
because
the
individuals
here
are
actually
employed
by
the
tribe
itself--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
is
the
second
theory.
because
the
individuals
here
are
actually
employed
by
the
tribe,
there
is
a
substantial
argument
we
think
that
the
income
tax
would
be
preempted
irrespective
of
where
the
individuals
live
because
any
taxes
paid
by
the
tribal
officers
and
employees
to
the
state
necessarily
has
an
impact
on
the
amount
of
money--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
the
mcclanahan
territorial
theory.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
i
was
suggesting
is
there
may
be
a
separate
theory
that
we
think
should
also
be
examined
on
remand
in...
because
here
the
individuals
are
actually
employees
of
the
tribe
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
might,
but
we
think
that
the
interference
with...
that
question
is
not
before
because
the
tenth
circuit
rejected
that,
but
the
interference
with
tribal
self-government
we
think
would
be
much
more
pronounced--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
because
just
as
a
matter
of
economics,
we
think
that
in
order
to
compete
in
the
labor
market,
if
the
individuals
whom
the
tribe
employs
have
to
pay
both
a
state
tax
and
on
top
of
that
a
tribal
tax,
the
tribe's
ability
to
operate
a
government
in
the
same
way
that
a
local
government
or
a
state
government
would
be
operated
outside
the
reservation,
they
would
be
competitively
disadvantaged.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
no.
they
would
be...
it's
simply
a
question
of
when
the
tribe
employs
its
own
members,
which
we
think
is
at
the
core
of
tribal
self-government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
it's
a
common
law
against
the
backdrop
of
200
years
of
this
nation's
history.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
it
goes
all
the
way
back
to
worcester
v.
georgia.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
again,
when
the
indian
activity
takes
place
in
indian
country,
that
is
the
historic
touchstone,
not
reservation.
indian
country
is
the
historic
touchstone
all
the
way
back
to
the
nonintercourse
acts
of
1790
and
1834
where
federal
and
state
law
applies
and
where...
excuse
me...
the
federal
and
tribal
law
applies
and
state
law
does
not.
and
in
worcester
v.
georgia,
the
court
said
as
long
as
there's
a
distinct
community
occupying
its
own
territory...
and
that
here
would
include
the
allotments
or
dependent
indian
communities,
as
well
as
the
trust--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
automobile
excise
tax
is
just
the
first
territorial
theory.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
a
dependent
indian
community.
it's
one
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
one
of
the
three
definitions
of
indian
country
under
1151.
it
covers
situations,
for
example,
where
there's
a
housing
authority
or
something
set
aside
by
the
federal
government
or
by
the
tribe
under
federal
auspices
where
indians
reside,
but
it
may
not
actually
be
trust
land.
it
may
not
be
on
a
true
reservation.
it's
a
definition
that's
developed
from
this
court's
decision
in
mcgowan
and
sandoval.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would.
the
territorial...
in
mcclanahan,
the
individual
does
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that
does
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
mcclanahan.
we
think
it's
significant
that
in
decoteau,
for
example,
where
this
court
held
the
reservation
was
disestablished,
the
court
was
at
some
pains
we
think
to
show
that
that
would
not
adversely
affect
the
indians
themselves
on
indian
country
outside
the
reservation.
it
said
even
within
indian
country,
which
the
court
pointed
out
specifically
included
allotments,
a
state
may
have
jurisdiction
over
some
persons
or
types
of
conduct,
but
this
jurisdiction
is
quite
limited.
and
the
court
specifically
cited
mcclanahan
after
that
recitation,
indicating
that
the
immunity
from
state
taxation
should
apply
even
though
the
reservation
was
disestablished
wherever
you
have
indian
country
and,
thus,
we
think
wherever
the
individual
is
residing
and
working
within
indian
country,
as
long
a
there
is
a
functioning
tribal
government
with
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
land.
here
we
think
that
the
compact
of
tribal
self-government
entered
into
between
the
sac
and
fox
nation
and
the
united
states
demonstrates
the
tribal
self-government,
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
is
alive
and
well
in
the
state.
