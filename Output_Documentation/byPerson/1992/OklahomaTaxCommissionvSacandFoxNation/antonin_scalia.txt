what
is
the
significance
of...
as
to
the
first
tax,
income
tax,
why
is
it
significant
that
the
indian
who
is
living
on
the
trust
land
works
for
the
tribe?
what
if
the
indian
doesn't
work
for
the
tribe,
works
for
somebody
else
on
the
trust
land?
is
there
any
contention
that
that
indian
does
not
owe
income
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
thought
they
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
the
theory
of
getting
off
is
either
a
tribal
self-government
theory,
in
which
case
you
ought
to
get
off
whether
you're
on
or
off
trust
land
so
long
as
you're
working
for
the
tribe,
or
else
the
theory
is
a
territorial
theory,
in
which
case
you
ought
to
get
off
so
long
as
you're
living
on
trust
land
whether
or
not
you're
working
for
the
tribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
basis?
equal
protection?
is
that
it
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
your
last
remarks
didn't
sound
like
territorial
based.
your
last
remarks
sounded
like--
--well,
he
was
getting
to
it.
was
he
getting
to
the
next
one?
he
was
getting
to
it.
i
thought
he
was
mixing
the
two
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
why
wouldn't
your
first
theory,
your
territorial
theory...
why
wouldn't
that
apply
to
someone
who's
not
employed
by
the
tribe?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you're
free
from
income
tax
whether
you're
employed
by
the
tribe
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you...
you're
claiming
this
exemption
not
just
for
income
received
from
the
tribe,
but
any
income?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
with
respect
to
the
car,
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
said
the
car...
the
indian
has
to
reside
on...
in
indian
country
and
also
the
car
has
to
be
garaged
there,
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so,
what
if
the
indian
lives
off
of
the
indian
country,
but
he
garages
his
car
in
the
indian
country.
is
that
car
exempt
from
the
taxes
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rice,
i
don't...
how
is
this
possibly
administrable
in
a
state,
especially
like
oklahoma,
where
there
are
just
a
lot
of
isolated
pockets
of
indian
territory?
your
position
is
if
the
money
is
earned
by
an
indian
in
indian
country,
it's
exempt
from
state
tax.
so,
what
do
you
do
with
somebody
that,
you
know,
drives
to
work...
let's
assume
he's
a
carpenter.
he
does
part
of
his
work
on
the
indian
country,
part
of
his
work
off
of
the
indian
country.
how
can
you
possibly
administer
a
scheme
like
that?
i
mean,
i
can
see
if
you're
limiting
it
to
income
received
from
the
tribe,
you
can
identify
it.
but
how
is
oklahoma
going
to
identify
what
income
is
earned
on
indian
country
and
what
is
earned
off
indian
country?
there's
a
whole...
i
can
see
whole
volumes
of
law
being
written
about
this
when
indian
income
is
earned.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
let's
assume
i'm
a
delivery...
my
business
is
delivering
newspapers
and
i
deliver
newspapers
to
somebody
in
indian
country.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
part
of
my
delivery
is
in
indian
country
and
part
of
my
route
is
outside
of
indian
country.
what
do
i
do?
divide
my
salary
by
2
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
i
think
the
situation
is
a
lot
rarer
in
the
interstate
situation
than
it
is
with
people
living
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
driving
in
and
out
of
indian
country
all
the
time.
