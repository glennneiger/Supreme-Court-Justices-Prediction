mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
agrees
with
tennessee
that
application
of
that
state's
sales
tax
to
the
lease
transactions
taking
place
entirely
within
its
borders
is
not
barred
by
either
the
customs
conventions
on
containers
or
the
foreign
commerce
and
import-export
clauses
of
the
constitution.
a
holding
by
this
court
to
that
effect
would
be
consistent
with
both
of
the
national
interests
that
are
implicated
in
a
case
such
as
this.
first,
it
would
serve
the
important
national
interest,
the
interest
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
individual
sovereign
states
to
impose
taxes
on
matters
within
their
borders,
and
thereby
to
ensure
that
those
engaged
in
foreign
commerce,
no
less
than
those
engaged
in
interstate
and
domestic
commerce,
bear
their
fair
share
of
the
burden
of
supporting
state
and
local
governments.
secondly,
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
a
holding
by
this
court
to
that
effect
would
be
consistent
with
the
united
states'
interests
in
international
relations
and
in
foreign
commerce.
our
position
rests
on
two
principal
points.
first,
the
conventions
on
containers,
the
implementing
statutes
and
regulations,
as
construed
by
the
executive
branch,
do
not
bar
generally
applicable
sales
taxes
of
this
nature.
secondly,
independent
of
the
convention,
unlike
in
japan
lines,
there
is
no
rule
or
principle
of
international
taxation
that
has
been
accepted
and
recognized
by
the
united
states
that
bars
taxes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in...
to
some
extent,
yes.
in
japan
line,
the
thrust
of
the
government's
argument,
though,
was
not
primarily
on
the
convention,
but
on
the
implementing
statutes
and
regulations,
which
i
can
address
in
a
moment.
but
basically
the
bonded
warehouse-statutes
involved
in
mcgoldrick
and
xerox...
there
was
a
suggestion
in
our
brief
that
those
same
rationales
would
apply
under
the
particular
statute,
1322(a),
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
on
further
reflection,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the...
that
there
really
is
not
an
analogy
between
those
two
provisions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
at
all,
and
we
think
pointedly
the
court
in
japan
line
did
not
rely
either
on
the
convention
or
on
the
statutes
that
petitioner
relies
on
here
to
invalidate
the
tax.
the
court
went
beyond
that.
logically
they
would
have
been
antecedent
to
reaching
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
taxes
violated
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
instead
resolved
it
on
that
ground
and,
therefore,
must
have
concluded...
and
did
not
accept
the
invitation
of
japan
lines
that
the
taxes
violated
the
principle
of
mcgoldrick
or
the
conventions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
would.
that...
the
statutes
involved
in
mcgoldrick
and
xerox
are
quite
different.
those
statutes
involved
bonded
warehouses
in
which
goods
come
and
are
essentially
held
at
the
border
and
are
under
the
custody
of
the
customs
service,
along
with
the
warehouse
person,
and
while
they're
in
that
custody,
they
are
accepted...
subject
to
extensive
regulation.
the
statute
at
issue
here
is
really
quite
different.
it
allows
the
goods
to
pierce
through
the
border
to
be
admitted
for
the
delivery
and
pickup
of
goods
within
the
united
states,
and
they
are
manifestly
not
within
the
custody
of
the
customs
service.
it's
logical,
just
under
a
straightforward
sense
of
the
supremacy
clause,
that
a
state
could
not
tax
goods
that
are
under
the
custody
at
the
border
of
the
customs
service,
but
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
at
the
moment
i
was
just
interpreting
or...
excuse
me...
addressing
mcgoldrick
and
the
xerox--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
xerox
cases.
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
about
the
statutory
point
before
i
move
on
to
the
conventions.
the
statute
at
issue
is
quoted
at
page
10
of
our
brief,
and
it
reads...
it
provides
that
instruments
of
international
traffic,
which
includes
containers,
are
exempt
from
the
application
of
the
customs
laws
to
such
extent
and
subject
to
such
terms
and
conditions
as
may
be
prescribed
in
regulations
or
instructions
of
the
secretary.
the
statute
itself
contains
no
exemption
even
from
the
customs
laws.
you're
referred
to
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
to
determine
what
exemptions
there
are.
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
in
this
case
exempt
containers
from
the
customs
laws
and
duties,
both
the
entry
and
the
duties
requirements,
but
they
do
not...
there's
nothing
in
the
regulations
to
which
this
court
should
defer
that
would
exempt
the
containers
from
state
taxes.
turning
to
the
convention
now,
if
i
may,
this
court
has
described
the
conventions
as
designed
to
remove
impediments
to
the
use
of
containers.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
japan
lines.
and
the
conventions
themselves
make
clear
what
sort
of
impediments
were
being
spoken
of,
and
those
impediments
are
ones
of
a
customs
nature.
these
are,
after
all,
conventions
called
customs
conventions
on
containers,
and
the
central
obligation
of
the
parties
under
the
conventions
is
to
allow
temporary
admission,
which
is
admission
defined
in
both
conventions
free
of
import
duties
and
taxes,
free
of
import
prohibitions
and
restrictions.
and
the
phrase
import
duties
and
taxes
is,
in
turn,
defined
as
custom
duties
or
other
taxes
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation
under
the
'56
convention
or
in
connection
with
importation
of
goods.
at
every
turn,
there
is
a
specific
reference
to
importation,
and
the
impediments
to
be
removed
are
customs.
the
protocol
of
signatures
reinforces
that
point.
the
protocol,
by
the
way,
is
reproduced
at
footnote
8
of
our
brief.
it
specifically
reserves
to
the
parties
the
right
to
impose
restrictions
not
of
a
customs
nature.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
precisely.
the
petitioner
argues
that
because
the
containers
may
be
present
in
the
country
by
reason
of
importation
that
that's
enough,
but
the
convention
refers
to
the
premise
for
the
tax.
is
the
tax
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation
or
imposed?
it
looks
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
government
levying
the
tax,
not
the
reason
why
the
container
may
be
within
the
country.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
in
fact,
presumably
the
court...
i
think
the
court
implicitly
so
concluded
in
japan
line
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
as
i
understand
the
uk's
position,
it
is
that
a
tax...
any
tax...
and
they
simply
pick
up
the
same
point
that
petitioner
does,
that
because
the
containers
are
present
by
reason
of
importation,
that
that's
sufficient.
they
also
rely
on
the
purposes
of
the
convention.
but
the
purposes
are
implemented
according
to
the
specific
terms
of
the
convention.
if
the
purposes
were
to
be
given
the
full
scope
that
petitioner
argues,
income
taxes
on
these
would
be
prohibited.
the
tax
on
the
repairs
of
the
containers
that
petitioner
doesn't
even
challenge
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but
that
is
something
that
would
focus
largely
on
the
moment
of
importation,
wharfage
fees
and
something
like
that,
as
the
goods
were
being
entered
into.
that's
something
different
from
the
sales
tax
within
the
united
states.
there's
another
reason
why
the
conventions
are
inapplicable,
and
that
is
that
they
do
not
apply
at
all
to
the
actions
of
the
parties
of
the
contracting
state,
which
we've
set
that
forth...
that
in
our
brief.
and
also
to
the
extent
the
negotiating
history
of
the
conventions
are
relevant
on
this
point,
petitioners
cite
in
their
reply
brief
some
excerpts
from
the
negotiating
history.
fairly
read
as
a
whole,
those...
the
negotiating
history
cuts
precisely
the
other
way,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
that
if
the
court
addresses
that
question.
turning
to
the
uk's
position
on
the
vat
tax,
our
point
there
is
that
the
vat
tax
does...
the
vat
does
tax
the
value
of
the
lease.
that's
our
simple
point.
and
so,
if
the
conventions
are
to
be
given
the
broad
scope
that
the
uk
would
argue
for
to
serve
their
policies,
then
taxing
the
value
of
the
lease
as
included
in
the
value
of
the
goods
should
be
equally
preempted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
precisely
so.
and
you
mentioned,
justice
kennedy,
earlier
the
question
that
the
uk
might
respond
by
imposing
a
tax
on
lease
transactions
there.
our
position
is
that
that's
not
the
sort
of
retaliation
that
the
commerce
clause
is
referring
to,
because
just
as
it
is
our
position
that
the
united
states
or
a
state
may
impose
a
tax
on
a
discrete
transaction,
so
may...
when
delivery
occurs
in
the
united
states,
so
may
a
foreign
country.
that's
not
multiple
taxation.
it's
just
the
uk
saying
we
might
do
what
tennessee
is
doing,
and
our
position
on
that
is
fine
because
as
in
wardair,
the
transaction
being
taxed,
in
that
case
sale
of
fuels...
fuel,
takes
place
entirely
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
so
that
is
not
a
threat
of
multiple
taxation.
