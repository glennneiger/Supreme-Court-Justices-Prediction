unknown
speaker
how
do
you
interpret
this
tax
to
be
imposed
to
be
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation?
that's
the
language
of
the
conventions
that
we're
dealing
with.
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
tax
anything
that
has
been
imported?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
by
reason
of
temporary
importation.
it
says
by
reason
of
importation,
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation.
now,
there
are
two
ways
to
read
it,
it
seems
to
me.
one
is,
the
tax
is
upon
the
act
of
importing.
it
is
upon
the
importing.
and
the
other
way
to
read
it
is
it...
importing
is
a
but-for
cause
of
the
tax.
you
wouldn't
have
been
hit
with
the
tax
if
you
hadn't
imported.
but
if
you
read
it
the
latter
way,
my
goodness,
all
imported
goods
are
free
from
property
taxes,
sales
taxes,
all
sorts
of
taxes.
you
can't
read
it
that
way,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
address
those?
does
it
mention
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
just
proves
that
they're
imported.
a
lot
of
other
things
are
imported
as
well.
unknown
speaker
is
a
general
property
tax
permissible
if
the
container
happens
to
be
there
on
the
lien
date?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm...
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
test.
suppose
the
state
says
that
all
personal
property
here
on
march
the
15th
shall
be
taxed.
unknown
speaker
and
the
container
is
assessed
a
tax.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
because
the
container
couldn't
have
been
there
but
for
the
importation
and,
therefore,
this
tax
must
be
by
reason
of
importation.
is
that
your
train
of
logic?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
is
certainly
taking
a
different
position
today,
and
it's
saying
that
the
convention
means
that
tennessee's
tax
is
collected
in
connection
with
and
chargeable
by
reason
of
sales,
not
by
reason
of
importation.
now,
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
government's
interpretation
of
this
treaty?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collier,
let
me
try
to
put
my
earlier
question
more
precisely.
what
kind
of
a
tax
upon
these
containers
would
not
be
a
tax
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation?
i
mean,
i
am
pressed
with
the
fact
that
these
treaties
do
not
say
containers
may
not
be
taxed.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
there
may
not
be
imposed
upon
them
any
taxes
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation.
now,
why
that
narrowing?
what
has
been
excluded
by
saying
only
those
taxes
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation?
unknown
speaker
what...
so,
you
say...
and
it
meant
that
even
before
that
provision
was
added
in
the
later
treaty?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
tennessee
tax...
what
do
they
call
it?
a
use
tax
or--
unknown
speaker
--a
sales
tax?
well,
don't
they
measure
it
by
the
number
of
days
in
tennessee
and
the
cost
of
services
rendered?
unknown
speaker
but
are
they
not
in
tennessee
at
the
time
of
the
transaction?
unknown
speaker
how
is
this
different
from
a
case
in
which,
say,
the
containers
were
manufactured
in
tennessee,
and
then
sold
to
the
person
who
was
going
to
use
them?
could
you
then
put
a
sales
tax
on
it?
unknown
speaker
for
use
in
foreign
commerce
and
after
that
they
never
do
anything
but
travel
the
world.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they're
warehoused
in
tennessee
and
then
they're
leased,
and
then
you
tax
the
consideration
for
the
lease
at
the
time
of
the
lease
transaction?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
be...
say
i'm
talking
about
a
new
container
now,
to
keep
it
simple.
if
i
have
a
new
container
and
i
sell
it
to
the
user
of
the
container,
that's
taxable,
but
if
i
have
the
same
used...
new
container
and
i
lease
it
to
them
for
a
period
of
time
that
it
takes
to
ship
it
to
japan
and
back
to
san
francisco,
that's
not
taxable.
unknown
speaker
the
hypothetical
is
i
have
a
brand-new
container,
and
i
have
a
customer
who
wants
to
lease
it,
take
some
merchandise
to
the
japan,
and
bring
that
merchandise
back
to
san
francisco.
and
it
will
take
9
months
to
do
it,
so
that
the
charge
will
be
x
dollars
and
the
sales
tax
is
2
percent
of
x
dollars.
is
that...
could
you...
would
that
transaction
be
taxable?
unknown
speaker
now,
what's
the
difference
between
the
sale
and
the
lease?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
far
as
the
leasing
company
is
concerned,
it's
still
an
article
of
trade.
he's
only
interested
in
getting
paid
for
the
container.
unknown
speaker
no.
it
becomes
bonded
as
soon
as
he
buys
it
because
the
purchaser
is
going
to
use
it
exclusively
in
commerce.
he's
going
lose
it...
use
it
for
the
life
of
the
container
in
one
case,
and
the
other
he's
going
to
use
it
for
a
tenth
of
the
life
of
the
container.
unknown
speaker
it
goes
into
the
stream
of
commerce.
immediately
upon
the
consummation
of
the
transaction,
they
seek
to
tax.
unknown
speaker
even
a
sales
tax.
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
language
of
the
treaty
possibly
cover
the
sales
tax?
because
it
isn't
there
by
reason
of
importation.
it's
there
by
reason
of
having
been
manufactured
there
and
sold.
unknown
speaker
what
position
had
the
united
states
taken
in
those
cases,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
in
the
two
cases
you've
just
described.
did
the
united
states
favor
the
state
taxes
or
disfavor
them?
unknown
speaker
do
all
of
those
things
if
it
eliminates
them
from
customs
duties
and
import
taxes,
but
it's...
it
does
benefit
them
that
way.
and
that's
an
additional
tax
that
these
containers
would
constantly
and
repetitively
be
subjected
to.
it
achieves
that
objective,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
in
addition
eliminate
sales
taxes
on
leases,
which
are
not
repetitive
and
which
all
property
is
subject
to
whether
it's
property
that's
constantly
used
in
commerce
or
not.
it
seems
quite
reasonable
to
me.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
language
in
those
cases?
was
it
language
that
even
approached
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
did
the
statute
say
anything
about
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
mean...
but
then
why
are
they
relevant?
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
text
here,
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
talking
about
a
federal
regulation,
surely
there
you
also
give
deference
to
the
executive
branch
in
construing
the
regulation,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
can
you
help
me
a
little
more
with
the
facts?
all
these
containers
are
manufactured
abroad,
and
they're
shipped
to
different
places
in
the
united
states,
including
tennessee.
when
they
arrive
in
tennessee,
is
there
any
duty
to
get
them
out
of
tennessee
within
a
limited
period
of
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
show
that
all
the
containers
at
issue
here
were
in
tennessee
for
less
than
3
months?
unknown
speaker
when
these
containers
come
into
the
united
states,
are
some
of
them
empty
or
are
they
all
full?
unknown
speaker
do
some
come
empty
to
tennessee
and
sit
in
a
warehouse
for
a
while
before
they're
leased
to
a
entity
who
used
them
to
ship
goods?
unknown
speaker
and
they're
empty
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
time
limit.
there's
no
legal
requirement
that
they
be
shipped
out
of
tennessee
within
a
fixed
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
see,
if
you
acknowledge
that,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
why
the
fact
they're
manufactured
abroad
makes
this
a
different
case
from
if
they
had
been...
a
case
in
which
they
had
been
manufactured
in
tennessee
empty
and
then
sold.
that's
what's
troubling
me.
maybe
you're
right,
but
i
have
some
difficulty
factually
seeing
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
that's
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that
tennessee
could
impose
some
sort
of
a
tax
if
it
had
a
reasonable
formula
for
determining
what
services
the
state
of
tennessee
were...
was
rendering.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
generally
provides
services
for
almost
any
kind
of
property
that's
within
the
state:
fire
and
police
protection,
things
like
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
was
the
tax...
sales
tax
measured
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
by
the
average.
was
there--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
wasn't
measured
by
any...
anything
related
to
the
time
the
container
was
in
tennessee.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
from
which
it
can
be
determined
the
average
amount
of
time
these
containers
were
in
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
thank
you.
could
you
tell
us
how
the
operation
of
foreign
tax
systems
becomes
relevant
to
your
case?
there
is
a
submission
that
the
european
community
does
not
impose
this
kind
of
tax.
why
is
that
relevant?
because
it
shows
an
interpretation
of
the
convention
or
because
it
shows
the
danger
of
multiple
taxations
if
we
rule
against
you,
or
both?
unknown
speaker
we
look
on
that
fact
as
evidence
of
how
to
interpret
the
treaty?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
reject
this
statement
in
the
government's
brief:
there
is
no
uniform
international
custom
or
practice
of
exempting
container
leases
from
the
effect
of
generally
applicable
tax
laws.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
collier.
general
burson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
were
to
find
as
a
definitive
matter
that
no
country
in
europe
under
its
interpretation
of
the
treaty
could
levy
the
tax
that
was
being
levied
here,
that
this
was
their
interpretation.
it's
not
our
interpretation,
but
it's
theirs...
and
that
were
definitive.
i
know
that's
in
dispute.
would
you
then
lose
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
we
were
to
find
that
a
ruling
in
your
favor
would
cause
the
levies
of
multiple
taxes
in
other
countries,
particularly
europe,
and
that
this
would
be
burdensome
on
foreign
commerce.
would
you
then
lose
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
quite
liable
to
happen.
if
we
rule
in
your
favor...
and
that's
a
definitive
interpretation
of
the
treaty...
i
take
it
european
countries
could
look
upon
that
as
very
persuasive
evidence
of
what
the
convention
means,
and
they
could
all
begin
to
levy
this
precise
kind
of
tax.
unknown
speaker
and
there
would
then
be
multiple
taxation
on
itel,
would
there
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
general
burson,
i
suppose
the
hardest
question
presented
here
is
the
meaning
of
the
conventions
dealing
with
these
containers,
which
clearly
were
entered
into
for
the
very
purpose
of
encouraging
the
use
of
them
and
keeping
the
cost
down
of
the
users
of
those
containers.
now,
you
do
agree,
do
you,
that
the
interpretation
of
the
conventions
by
other
nations
who
are
signatories
to
it
is
relevant
in
our
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
convention?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
we
do.
is
it
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
what
we're
looking
at
is
the
meaning
of
the
convention
itself.
we
have
to
look
at
the
language,
and
i
suppose
consider
the
interpretation
of
all
parties
to
the
convention--
unknown
speaker
--not
just
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
tennessee's
tax
here
does
have
an
effect
very
similar
to
a
customs
duty,
as
it's
imposed
on
these
containers
that
apparently
are
in
tennessee
only
a
very
short
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
your
state
puts
an
income
tax
on
intel...
is
that
the
name?
unknown
speaker
itel?
unknown
speaker
measured
by
the
income
it
gets
in
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
itel
has
a
2-year
lease
and
this
container
is
going
to
go
first
to
england
and
then
to
india
and
then
to
japan,
but
it's
not...
the
destination
is
not
fixed
for
certain
as
of
the
time
it
goes
to
england.
it
goes
first
to
england.
in
england,
itel
then
does
some
telephone
calls
and
soliciting
and
it's
determined
that
the
direction
of
that
container
will
be
diverted
and
it
will
go
back
to
canada.
can
england
tax
the
transaction
that
resulted
in
that
container
being
diverted
and
assigned
to
a
new
destination?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
multiple
tax
on
the
same
transaction,
though,
would
it
not?
because
your
tax
extends
for
the
whole
2-year
period,
and
england
has
taxed
it
once
again,
that
portion
of
the
transaction
which
was
the
reassignment
of
the
container.
unknown
speaker
general
burson,
as
i
understand
it,
the
incidence
of
your
tax
is
upon
the
lease.
it's
not
upon
the
containers
themselves.
it's
not
even
a
property
tax
on
the
containers.
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
foreign
countries
also
have
some
exactions
that
affect
the
containers,
as
your
tax
does.
it's
your
contention
that
the
vat
tax
amounts
to
that,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
the
vat
tax
is
upon
the
contents
of
the
containers,
but
the
value
of
those
contents
is
increased
for
purposes
of
the
vat
by
the
leasing
cost
that's
attributable
to
them.
so
that,
in
effect,
the
lease
is
being
taxed
through
the
vat
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
know
whether
foreign
countries,
other
signatories
to
the
treaty,
would
be
tempted
to
impose
the
same
kind
of
a
tax
as
tennessee?
i
mean,
that
is,
do
they
generally
have
sales
taxes?
unknown
speaker
what
would
they
do
if
an
empty
container
were
shipped
to
england?
there
would
be
no
vat
tax
then.
unknown
speaker
and
empty
containers
are
shipped
in
the
course
of
itel's
regular
business,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
general
burson,
before
you
get
off
the
last
point,
you
would
not...
empty
containers
can
be
shipped
out
of
tennessee
as
much
as
itel
wants
so
long
as
they
don't
lease
it
to
somebody.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
ship
those
empty
containers
all
around
the
world
so
long
as
they
don't
enter
a
lease
in
tennessee.
unknown
speaker
some...
are
any
leases
executed
abroad,
or
are
they
all
made
in
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand,
but
does
itel,
in
fact,
conclude
some
leases
abroad?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
don't
reach...
you
don't
even
reach
the
value
of
the
leases
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
you
tax
based
on
the
delivery,
not
the
execution
of
the
lease.
unknown
speaker
where
was
that
language
you
just
read
from?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
materials
before
us?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
furnish
the
court
a
copy
if
you--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
practice,
which
may
consist
of
nothing
more
than
that
other
countries
don't
have
a
sales
tax,
period,
on
containers
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
but
apparently...
is
it
also
true
that
tennessee
is
the
only
one
of
the
50
states
in
the
united
states
that
does
this?
unknown
speaker
we
didn't
get
any
amicus
briefs
from
any
other
states,
i
don't
think,
did
we?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
burson.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
mr.
collier
says
that
the
government
has
changed
its
position
in
one
aspect
of
this
case
since
its
appearance
in
japan
line
in
1978.
do
you
agree
with
that
contention?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
japan
lines
have...
come
out
the
other
way?
or
do
you
think
that
japan
lines
should
have
come
out
the
other
way
under
your
current
view?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
mcgoldrick
itself?
under
your
present
view,
would
it
still
have
come
out
the
same?
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
have
briefs
in
this
case
from
amici
who
think
that
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
differently.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
submission
is
that
this
state
tax
is
not
by
reason
of
or
in
connection
with--
unknown
speaker
--so,
a
property
tax
should
also
be
valid
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
the
british
government
disagrees
with
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
it
says
there's
another
provision
in
the
later
convention
that
allows
taxes
on
the
basis
of
services
provided.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
that
would
be
true
even
if,
as
often
happens,
the
lessee
ships
an
empty
container.
unknown
speaker
because
ultimately
it
would
be
in
the
cost
of
the
goods.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
collier,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
aware
of...
is
it
a
principle
of
contract
law,
for
example,
that
if
eight
out
of
nine
parties
to
the
contract
interpret
it
a
certain
way,
that's
what
it
must
mean?
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
but
surely
we're
bound
by
what
it
means,
and
if
our
understanding
is
the
correct
one,
that
ought
to
be
it.
are
there
cases
in
which
they
have
held,
in
effect,
that
by
reason
of
means
just
being
present
in
the
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
they
take
this
position
in
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
isn't
the...
doesn't
the
cost
include
the
cost
of
leasing
the
containers
to
get
the
beer
there?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
sales
tax
technically,
but
the
question
is
you
say
it
is
in
effect,
and
so
is
the
vat
in
effect.
now,
it's
divvied
up
among
all
of
the
states
that
use
the
container
over
time,
but
in
effect
it
reaches
the
leases
just
as
the
tennessee
sales
tax
does.
