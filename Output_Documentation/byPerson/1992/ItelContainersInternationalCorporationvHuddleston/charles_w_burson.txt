mr.
charles
w.
burson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
raises
three
challenges
to
tennessee's
sales
tax
as
applied
to
leases
of
intermodal
containers
delivered
to
lessees
in
the
state.
the
tax
is
preempted
by
the
terms
of
the
1956
and
1972
customs
conventions.
the
tax
impermissibly
impinges
upon
the
foreign
commerce
clause,
and
the
tax
frustrates
the
purposes
of
the
export-import
clause.
it's
the
state's
contention
that
the
following
two
propositions
dispose
of
these
arguments.
one,
the
tax
is
a
generally
applicable,
nondiscriminatory
sales
tax.
it's,
thus,
beyond
the
scope
of
the
customs
conventions'
prescriptions
of
duties
and
taxes
imposed
by
reason
of
or
in
connection
with
importation.
two,
the
tax
as
applied
isn't
at
variance
with
any
doctrine
or
principle
of
international
taxation
accepted
by
the
united
states.
this
principle
disposes
of
foreign
commerce
concerns,
for
if
the
tax
doesn't
conflict
with
international
principles
recognized
by
the
united
states,
there
can
be
no
state
interference
with
the
federal
government's
regulation
of
foreign
commerce.
the
two
principles
together
establish
that
the
tax
doesn't
frustrate
the
purposes
of
the
export-import
clause,
as
articulated
in
michelin.
the
tax
at
issue
is
not
a
duty
imposed
by
reason
of
or
in
connection
with
importation.
it's
a
garden
variety
sales
tax.
it's
a
source
of
general
revenue
for
tennessee.
as
virtually
all
generally
applicable
sales
taxes,
it
applies
to
the
sale
of
goods
and
to
leases
of
personal
property
wherein
delivery
occurs
within
the
state.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
sir.
what
we
say
is
essential
is
what
this
nation
recognizes.
that's
the
voice
with
which...
the
voices
with
which
the
united
states
speak
as
the
principles
that
we
have
to
be
in
compliance
with.
the
foreign
commerce
clause
doesn't
tell
tennessee
it
has
to
comply
with
the
dictates
of
foreign
nations
and
their
practices.
what
it
tells
us
is
we
have
to
comply
with
and
be
uniform
with
expression
of
our
national
policies
in
regard
to
international
trade.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
if
you
were
to
find
that
it
would
be
burdensome
on
foreign
commerce
and
this
court
recognized
some
uniform
doctrine
that
was
recognized
by
this
nation,
yes,
but
in
a
vacuum,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--specific--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--specifically
there
would
be
similar...
perhaps
similar
taxation,
not
necessarily
multiple
taxation,
and
we
would
suggest
that's
not
the
type
of
impediment
that
the
conventions
addressed
it
to.
that's
not
the
type
of
concern
that
the
united
states
has
expressed.
so,
even
with
that
finding,
we
would
say
there's
no
principle
which
would
say
tennessee's
tax
should
fail--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--justice
o'connor,
it's
our
contention
that
you
don't
need
to
get
to
the
practice
for
interpretation,
that
the
textual--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--if
you
do,
it
is
relevant,
but
we
would
contend
that
what
is
more
relevant
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
its
interpretation
of
the
treaty
to
determine
whether
tennessee
is
violative
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
that's
what
we're
looking
at.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
and
we
would
suggest--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes.
excuse
me.
yes.
we
would
suggest,
though,
that
great
deference...
this
court
would
give
great
deference
to
the
interpretation
of
that
treaty
by
the
united
states.
this
is
in
this
instance
a
voice
that
we're
looking
to
be
consistent
with.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
now,
we
would
disagree
with
that
proposition,
justice
o'connor.
if
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
what
they're
trying
to
free
these
containers
from,
it's
more
than
just
the
economic...
the
incidence
of
a
tax
in
the
form
of
a
customs
duty.
what
they're
trying
to
free
these
containers
up
for...
and
it's
in
their
brief,
footnote
3.
one
of
the
main
things
is
to
enable
these
containers
to
flow
across
national
boundaries
without
having
to
get
unloaded,
without
having
to
comply
with
customs.
in
the
united
states,
we
have,
in
effect,
given
effect
to
this
treaty
and
the
interpretation,
our
interpretation
by
our
federal
statutes,
and
by
our
federal
regulations,
is
that
they
are
only
relieved
in
the
statute
from
the
customs
laws,
that
in
our
federal
regulations
they
are
only
relieved
from
duties
and
from
complying
with
the
necessary
paperwork
when
they
cross
the
territorial
boundaries.
so,
the
united
states
is
not
only
here
before
this
court
asserting
that
the
conventions
don't
mean
what
petitioner
contends,
but
in
our
very
enactments,
in
our
statutory
enactments
and
regulations,
it's
reflected
that
we're
only
talking
about
matters
of
a
customs
nature
and
customs
laws.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
itel.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
think
we
would
have
an
apportioned
income
tax...
excise
tax
on
itel's
business,
yes,
sir.
let
me
mention
one
thing.
justice
kennedy
raised
the
question
about
property
taxes,
and
in
testing
this
theory,
in
fact,
really
the
premise
in
japan
line
was
that
japan,
who
is
a...
i
think
a
party
to
these
treaties...
the
premise
was
they
could
impose
the
property
tax.
that's
the
reason
california
couldn't,
because
japan
was
imposing
a
personal
property
tax
on
those
articles.
in
that
case,
california
was
trying
to
do
it
on
a
foreign
corporation,
but
here
we
have
a
domestic
corporation.
now,
if
the
principle
is
and
if
this
court
has
recognized
the
principle
that
personal
property
tax...
taxes
are
assessable
on
these
containers,
it
flies
right
in
the
face
of
the
contention
that
this
treaty
means
that
no
taxes
can
be
imposed
on
these
containers
by
virtue
of
their
mere
presence.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it
would
be
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
treaty
or
in
international
principle
that
would
say
it
couldn't.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
the...
they're
using
the
same
economic
measure
of
the
tax.
tennessee
uses,
as
its
measure
for
its
tax,
the
consideration.
the
vat
tax,
when
it
taxes
the
goods,
uses
at
least
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
the
lease
as
a
measure
of
its
vat
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
with
trying
to...
even
looking
at
the
multiple
taxation
situation
in
the
absence
of
a
uniform
principle,
we're
talking
about
nations
with
entirely
different
tax
structures.
europe
doesn't
have
a
sales
tax
structure.
they
have
a
vat
tax.
japan--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
there
would
be
no
goods.
so,
there
would
be
no
vat
tax
i
assume
on
that.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
sir.
the
foreign
commerce
clause
precludes
states
from
engaging
in
practices
which
are
at
variance
with
the
regulation
of
foreign
commerce
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
exactly
right,
justice--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
that
was
the
case
on
this
record,
that
there
are
containers
that
they
interchange
and
don't
enter
into
leases
that
come
in
and
out
of
tennessee
that
are
not...
that
no
tax
applies
to.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
the...
all
the...
the
taxes
here
are
where
delivery
has
occurred
in
tennessee.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
it's
my
understanding
that
all
leases
are
concluded
in
san
francisco
or
are
executed
in
san
francisco.
there
are
cases
where
they
deliver,
yes,
where
delivery
occurs
in
other
jurisdictions.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
correct.
tennessee's
whole
sales
tax
scheme...
in
fact,
in
most
jurisdictions
in
this
country,
the
sales
tax
is
based
upon
delivery.
and
let
make
a
point.
these
containers
come
into
tennessee
and
then
they
are
competing
for
transport
business
within
tennessee
with
other
commercial
activity
in
that
state,
and
it's
this
commercial
activity
that
tennessee
is
taxing,
not
the
mere
presence
or
even
the
mere
transit
through
the
state
of
these
container
leases.
quite
frankly,
it's
much
less
of
a
tax,
say,
on
importation
than
is
the
vat
tax,
which
is...
really
taxes
the
goods
because
they're
imported
and
gets,
within
the
economic
measure
of
that
tax,
the
cost
of
the
lease.
we
would
contend
that
controlling...
let
me
go
back
to
the
textual
aspect
of
the
treaty
one
second,
and
that
is,
if
everything
is...
our
statutes,
our
regulations,
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself...
says
this
is
intended
to
apply
to
customs
duties.
under
the
protocol
of
signatures,
they...
which
is
a
part
of
the
treaty,
they
specifically
say:
the
terms
of
the
present
convention
shall
not
preclude
the
application
of
national
provisions
or
of
international
agreements
not
of
a
customs
nature,
regulating
the
use
of
these
containers.
we
would
just
contend
that's
further
evidence
that
what
the
treaties
are
getting
at
are
actually
the
customs...
a
customs
type
of
a
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that's
under
the
protocol
of
signature,
which
is
a
part...
incorporates
a
part
of
the
convention,
and--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well,
i
think
that...
supposedly
the
convention
language
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
is
represented
in
the
joint
appendix
to
be
the
entire
convention,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
i
could
furnish
the
court
a
copy
of
that.
it's
the
united
nations
treaty
series
dealing
with
the
1972
container
convention.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
what
the
concern
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause
is,
it's
our
contention,
is
the
uniformity
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
our
actions
in
regard
to
policies
recognized
by
the
federal
government.
this
court's
jurisprudence
instructs
us
that
in
identifying
those
principles,
the
court
looks
to
treaties
or
conventions,
as
we're
doing
here,
to
federal
statutes,
to
the
manner
in
which
national
laws
are
applied,
to
this
court's
recognition
of
established
doctrine
of
international
law,
and
to
the
positions
taken
by
the
united
states
in
proceedings
before
this
court.
in
japan
line,
there
was
a
custom
of
nations
against
which
you
could
measure
the
deviation
of
the
california
tax.
in
this
case,
we
have
no
such
recognized
custom
of
nations.
the
only
thing
that
petitioners
point
to,
one
way
or
another,
either
as
a
policy
or
as
preemption
doctrine,
is
the
treaty.
we
would
suggest
that
the
plain
language--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yes,
yes.
and
it
seems
they're
making
the
argument
that
the
practice
informs
us
about
the
meaning
of
the
treaty,
but
they
also
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
the
practice
in
some
way
establishes
a
recognized
uniform
principle
of
international
taxation,
and
we
would
contend
that
is
just
not
the
case.
there
is
no
such
principle
in
relation
to
this
form
of
taxation
that
would...
in
which
tennessee's...
or
to
which
tennessee's
tax
is
asymmetrical.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
you
know,
the
record
is...
not
necessarily.
the
record
is
very
skimpy
on
this.
in
fact,
it's
based
upon
one
statement
by
a
director
of
marketing
that
says,
to
your
knowledge
has
any
state
other
than
tennessee
stopped
to
impose
a
sales
tax
on
the
proceeds
of
international
cargo
containers.
and
the
director
of
marketing
said,
not
to
my
knowledge.
their
statement
that
no
other
state
imposes
is
based
upon
that.
in
fact,
there
is
a
letter
ruling
from
massachusetts
back
in
'79
after
japan
line
in
which
that
very
question
was
posed
to
them,
and
they
said
their
tax
did
apply
to
leases
and
sales
of
containers,
and
again,
we'd
be
happy
to
furnish
that
to
the
court
upon
request.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
but
i
don't...
your
honor,
we
would
contend,
justice
stevens,
that
nothing
should
be
read
into
that.
we
have
plenty
of
experience
either
of
getting...
hustling
up
amicus
briefs
or
not,
and
again,
we
think
that
the
position
of
tennessee
supported
by
the
united
states
amply
addresses
the
questions
raised
by
petitioner
in
this
case.
again,
it's
a
generally
applicable
sales
tax,
nondiscriminatory,
and
there
is
no
recognized
principle
of
international
law
in
which
our
actions
are
deviated.
