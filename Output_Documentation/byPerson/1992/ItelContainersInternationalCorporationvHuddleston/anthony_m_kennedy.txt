justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
i
have
to
announce
is
itel
containers
versus
huddleston,
no.
91-321.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
is
a
tax
case
involving
the
standard
large
steel
containers
that
are
used
in
the
international
shipping
industry
for
transporting
the
goods
by
truck
and
rail
and
oceangoing
carrier.
in
1990,
a
cargo
container
ships
60%
of
united
states
in
marine
imports
and
52%
of
our
marine
exports.
petitioner
itel
containers
is
an
american
corporation
and
its
principal
business
is
leasing
these
containers.
the
petitioner’s
leases
are
solicited
and
negotiated
in
six
different
states
and
the
leased
containers
are
delivered
to
lessees
or
their
agents
in
many
of
the
50
states
including
tennessee.
the
tennessee
deliveries
occur
either
at
the
petitioner’s
memphis
terminal
or
at
several
designated
third
party
terminals.
in
december
1986,
the
tennessee
department
of
revenue
assessed
$392,000.00
in
sales
tax
penalties
and
interest
on
the
proceeds
petitioner
earned
from
leased
containers
delivered
in
tennessee
between
january
1983
and
november
1986.
the
petitioner
paid
under
protest
and
filed
an
action
for
refund
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
tennessee
tax
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
import-export
clause,
and
the
supremacy
clause.
the
state
court
reduced
the
tax
assessed
on
a
state
low
grounds
but
it
rejected
the
petitioner’s
constitutional
claims
and
essentially
ordered
all
of
the
tax
paid.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
affirmed.
the
court
concluded
that
congress
had
not
acted
to
bar
state
sales
taxes
on
cargo
container
leases
and
the
state
supreme
court
further
concluded
that
the
state
tax
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
it
does
impose
only
upon
a
discreet
transaction,
the
transferred
possession
of
cargo
containers
in
tennessee.
finally,
the
court
held
that
the
tennessee
tax
does
not
offend
the
import-export
clause
because
it
does
not
prevent
the
federal
government
from
speaking
with
one
voice
on
foreign
affairs
and
it
is
not
a
direct
tax
on
the
value
of
goods
destined
for
export.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
petitioner’s
primary
challenge
is
that
the
tennessee
sales
tax
is
proscribed
by
two
international
conventions,
the
1972
and
1956
customs
convention
on
containers.
the
text
of
the
conventions,
however,
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
the
reason
the
state
imposes
a
tax
that
determines
whether
it
violates
the
container
conventions.
the
conventions
disallow
only
those
taxes
imposed
based
on
the
act
of
importation
itself.
the
tennessee
sales
tax
in
contrast
is
a
sales
tax
of
general
application
that
does
not
discriminate
against
imported
products
either
in
its
purpose
or
effect.
the
petitioner
also
argues
that
tennessee
sales
taxes
preempted
because
it
would
frustrate
the
federal
objectives
underlying
the
container
conventions
and
the
federal
laws
and
regulations
granting
favored
status
for
the
international
containers,
but
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
for
containers
discloses
no
congressional
intent
to
exempt
those
containers
from
all
or
most
domestic
taxation.
the
precise
federal
policy
regarding
promotion
of
container
used
is
satisfied
by
a
prescription
against
taxes
or
imposed
upon
or
discriminated
against
the
importation
of
containers.
we
find
that
tennessee’s
general
sales
tax,
which
applies
to
domestic
and
foreign
goods
without
differentiation
does
not
impede
the
federal
objectives
expressed
in
the
1972
and
1956
container
conventions
and
related
federal
statutes
and
regulations.
petitioner
also
challenges
the
tennessee’s
tax
has
violated
the
foreign
commerce
clause
and
of
the
provision
in
the
constitution
prohibiting
states
from
taxing
imports
or
exports
and
for
the
reasons
given
in
our
opinion,
we
reject
these
contentions
as
well.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
