mr.
philip
w.
collier
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
tennessee's
sales
tax
imposed
on
itel's
federally
bonded
containers
dedicated
exclusively
to
use
in
foreign
commerce
is
prohibited
by
the
1956
and
1972
treaties
on
containers,
as
well
as
the
body
of
federal
implementing
regulation,
and
the
foreign
commerce
and
import-export
clauses
of
the
constitution.
at
the
time
tennessee
imposed
its
tax,
itel
was
one
of
the
largest
container
leasing
companies
in
the
world.
itel
delivered
its
containers
at
98
locations
across
the
united
states
and
an
additional
129
locations
around
the
globe;
but
only
one
government
in
the
world
imposed
a
tax
on
itel's
containers,
tennessee.
as
the
united
kingdom
and
other
nations
have
noted,
none
of
the
59
nations
which
have
signed
the
two
container
treaties
impose
any
form
of
sales
or
use
taxation
on
containers.
but
it
is
not
the
language
here
of
tennessee's
taxing
statute
which
is
unique.
instead,
it
is
the
application
of
that
statute
to
tax
container
leases.
indeed,
44
of
tennessee's
sister
states
and
many
of
the
signatory
nations
to
the
container
treaties
impose
some
form
of
sales
or
use
taxation
on
lease
transactions.
but
it
not
mere
coincidence
that
no
other
government
in
the
world
imposes
sales
or
use
tax
equivalents
on
containers.
the
reason
that
tennessee
acts
alone
here
is
that
the
imposition
of
its
tax
is
prohibited
by
the
container
treaties,
runs
counter
to
the
custom
of
nations,
and
is
at
odds
with
this
court's
logic
in
the
japan
line
decision.
there
are
three
related,
but
independent
grounds
for
reversal
here.
each
ground
shares
in
common
the
special
transitory
nature
of
federally
bonded
containers
dedicated
exclusively
to
use
in
foreign
commerce.
first,
both
the
terms
and
the
policies
of
the
container
treaties
and
the
implementing
federal
regulation
prohibit
the
tax,
and
the
application
of
the
tax
by
tennessee
offends
the
principles
of
the
foreign
commerce
clause
by
creating
a
substantial
and
genuine
threat
of
foreign
retaliation
and
because
of
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation.
finally,
tennessee's
tax
is
a
prohibited
tax
on
goods
in
transit
under
the
logic
of
the
import-export
clause
of
the
constitution.
now,
the
issue
of
whether
the
terms
of
the
container
treaties
prohibit
tennessee's
tax
presents
a
direct
confrontation
between
the
united
states
and
14
nations,
including
three
of
the
united
states'
largest
five
trading
partners,
japan,
germany,
and
the
united
kingdom.
the
united
kingdom,
a
primary
drafter
of
the
1956
treaty,
and
the
other
protesting
nations
concur
with
itel's
reading
of
the
express
terms
of
the
convention
that
tennessee's
tax
is
prohibited
because
it
is
imposed
in
connection
with
or
by
reason
of
the
containers'
importation.
these
protesting
nations
point
out
that
they
have
withheld
the
application
of
their
taxes
in
reliance
upon
these
treaties'
obligations.
now,
the
position
taken
by
the
united
states
today,
that
the
treaties
prohibit
only
the
imposition
of
customs
duties
and
not
state
taxes,
is
at
odds
and
is
a
complete
reversal
of
its
position
taken
in
1978
before
this
court
in
japan
line.
so,
certainly
the
reading
given
today
of
the
treaties'
language
must
be
viewed
and
consider...
must
be
viewed
and
considered
in
light
of
that
interpretation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes,
justice
scalia.
the
concept
of
importation,
as
described
in
the
convention,
not
only
connotes
a
temporal
event,
such
as
the
crossing
of
a
border,
but
indeed,
the
status
of
the
containers
as
they
remain
within
the
borders
of
a
signatory
nation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
you
cannot
tax
a
container
once
it
has
been
temporarily
imported
and
remains
subject
to
the
protection
of
the
treaties.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
first
of
all,
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
two
readings
which
might
be
given
to
this
tax.
you've
identified
each
of
them,
but
both
meanings
are
incorporated
into
the
treaty
provisions.
first,
the
treaty
does
not
prohibit
the
imposition
of
all
taxes
on
imported
goods,
but
addresses
containers
which
are
crossing
borders
and
moving
into
the
interior
of
a
nation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes.
the
1956
treaty
tax
prohibition
covers...
and
i
quote...
not
only
customs
duties,
but
also
all
duties
and
taxes
whatsoever
chargeable
by
reason
of
importation.
and
the
definition
of
temporary
admission
given
in
the
1956
treaty
applies
to
containers
and
the
importation
of
those
containers
into
the
interior
pass...
crossing
the
border
of
a
nation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
a
number
of
other
things
are
imported,
but
the
treaties
on
containers
cover
taxes
on
containers,
not
merely
the
goods
imported
in
containers.
and
so,
the
treaties'
application
is
limited
to
those
containers
and
a
tax
on
those
containers.
the
definition
of
temporary
admission,
set
forth
in
article
1(b)
of
the
treaty
of
'72,
describes
temporary
admission
to
mean
temporary
importation
subject
to
reexportation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
if
the
tax
is
imposed
by
reason
of
importation--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--yes.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
do
believe
that
under
the
treaties
a
property
tax
based
upon
presence
would
be
by
reason
of
importation
to
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that's
a
fair
summary.
and,
indeed,
the
united
states
in
1978
in
its
brief
pointed
out
to
this
court
that
containers
which
have
crossed
the
international
border
and
entered
the
domestic
commerce
of
a
nation
are
considered
to
be
absent.
they're
not
subject
to
state
taxation
once
they're
in
the
interior
of
a
nation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i
think
it
has
been
recognized
many
times
by
this
court
that
the
interpretation
of
an
international
treaty
by
the
executive
branch
is
due
deference.
my
only
point,
justice
o'connor,
is
simply
that
they
have
expressed
one
interpretation
in
1978
and
the
other
at
this
time,
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
ruled
in
nielsen
v.
johnson
that
where
a
treaty
fairly
admits
two
interpretations,
the
one
restricting
and
the
other
enlarging
rights
provided
for
in
that
treaty,
then
the
liberal
interpretation
is
to
be
preferred.
and
certainly
the
united
states
cannot
disagree
that
the
interpretation
placed
on
this
treaty
by
eight
of
the
original
12
drafters
and
in
harmony
with
its
interpretation
in
1978
is
unreasonable.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
the
1972
treaty
clarified
that
issue
when
it
provided
a
limited
exception
to
the
type
of
taxes
that
could
be
imposed
on
containers,
and
that
exception
is
set
forth
in
article
1(a)
of
the
container
treaty
of
1972
where
the
treaty
excluded
fees
and
charges
limited
in
amount
to
the
approximate
cost
of
services
rendered.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
an
exception
which
is
provided
to
a
prohibition
of
taxes
in
a
treaty
need
not
have
been
provided
unless
that
was
prohibited
by
the
general
prohibition
in
the
first
place.
so,
there
is
an
exception.
if
tennessee,
for
instance,
operates
a
container
terminal
where
it
provides
a
crane
and
services
to
a
container,
it
may
then
tax
or
charge
a
fee
on
the
containers
in
that
setting.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
it
did.
in
fact,
there
is
legislative
history
to
the
1956
convention
which
discusses
the
permissibility
of
user
fees
of
this
kind.
so,
the--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--a
sales
tax.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
they
do
not.
tennessee's
tax
bears
no
relationship
to
the
length
of
the
lease,
the
number
of
days
that
the
container
is
on
lease.
it
is
based
simply
on
the
transfer
of
possession
within
the
jurisdiction.
indeed,
itel's
leases,
as
is
noted
in
the
record,
are
6
months
or
more.
they're
per
diem
leases,
and
these
containers
during
the
lease
term
are
in
tennessee
for
only
a
fraction,
a
very
small
fraction,
of
the
lease
term.
so
it
is
not
charged
on
that
basis.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
it
is
true
that
the
containers
are
present
and
have
been
imported
into
tennessee
at
the
time
of
the
tax.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
in
the
limited
situation
that
you
have
posed,
justice
stevens,
yes,
there
is
some
argument
that
could
be
made
that
a
purely
domestic
transaction,
the
sale
of
a
container--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--as
long
as--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--in
the
event
that
they
were
warehoused
in
tennessee,
as
long
as
they
were
continuously
dedicated
to
the
use
in
foreign
commerce,
they
would
still
be
exempted
under
the
tax
treaty
prohibition.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
hypothetical.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
that
transaction
would
not
be
taxable,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
the
sale
is
the
container
as
an
article
of
trade
as
opposed
to
an
instrument
of
international
traffic.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
in
the
situation
of
the
sale
of
the
goods
purely
in
domestic
commerce,
if
it
has
not
been
bonded
and
if
it's
not
exclusively
used
in
foreign
commerce,
then
it
is
not
entitled
to
the
protections.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
your
question
earlier.
if
it,
in
fact,
was
in
the
stream
of
foreign
commerce
and
was
sold
as
an--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--in
that
situation,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
that
the
treaty
does
prohibit
the
imposition
of
such
a
tax.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
this
case,
we--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--i
think
that's
a
good
point,
justice
stevens,
and
i
suppose
i
simply
haven't
considered
it
well
enough.
indeed,
in
this
case,
all
of
itel's
containers...
and
it's
stipulated...
were
all
manufactured
abroad
and
brought
in
as
instruments
of
international
traffic.
so,
that
situation
would
not
obtain
in
this
situation.
in
any
event,
putting
aside
for
a
moment
the
precise
language
and
terms
of
the
container
treaties,
this
court
has
consistently
invalidated
the
imposition
of
state
taxes
on
goods
dedicated
to
use
in
foreign
commerce
where
the
imposition
of
that
state
tax
removes
the
benefit
from
the
imposition
from
the
waiver
of
federal
customs
duties.
in
xerox
corporation
v.
harris
county,
texas,
and
mcgoldrick
v.
gulf
oil
corporation,
the
court
considered
the
preemptive
effect
of
federal
statutes
which
merely
excepted
goods
from
customs
duty.
in
the
first
case,
it
was
copiers
transshipped
to
houston,
texas.
in
the
second
case,
it
was
fuel
oil
which
had
been
refined
after
importation
from
venezuela
and
was
on
its
way
out
to
be
sold
to
ship
stores
in
new
york
harbor.
in
each
case,
despite
the
fact
the
congressional
statute
did
not
address
the
imposition
of
state
taxes,
this
court
invalidated
the
state
tax
because
it
posed
the
same
obstacle
that
was
posed
by
the
imposition
of
a
customs
duty.
in
mcgoldrick,
it
was
the
new
york
city
sales
tax
on
fuel
oil
to
be
exported
as
ship
stores
in
vessels
that
were
laid
in
new
york
harbor,
and
in
the
xerox
case,
it
was
copiers,
which
were
manufactured
in
mexico,
were
brought
into
houston,
and
were
intended
to
be
sold
outside
of
the
nation.
this
case
is
essentially
a
replica
of
that
situation.
first,
the
objectives
of
the
container
treaties
are
three-fold.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i'm
sorry.
in
japan
line
or
in--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--i
simply
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
in
the
situation
in
our
case,
the
united
states
reasoned
that
mcgoldrick
did
apply
to
containers
under
the
treaty
and
under
the
federal
regulation,
and
indeed,
the
united
states
in
japan
line
pointed
out
to
this
court
that
not
only
the
treaties,
but
the
implementing
federal
regulation
created
a
circumstance
where
the
containers
were
simply
not
present
for
purposes
of
state
taxation,
and
that
the
tax
on
containers
should
be
invalidated
under
the
reasoning
of
mcgoldrick.
there
are
three
objectives
to
the
treaties
here.
the
first
is
the
overarching
objective
of
the
treaties
to
encourage
the
selection
of
containers
for
carrying
goods
in
foreign
commerce.
the
reason
behind
the
treaty
was
that
this
would
simply
reduce
the
unit
transport
cost
of
goods
as
they
travel
in
an
increasing
international
market.
now,
there
were
two
other
purposes,
though,
to
this
treaty
adopted
and
articulated
by
the
united
states.
first,
president
johnson
in
1966,
in
recommending
the
adoption
of
the
1956
treaty,
noted
that
the
purpose
of
the
conventions
were
to
aid
the
american
export
drive
by
reducing
the
cost
of
carrying
american
goods
by
container
to
foreign
markets.
and
finally,
the
u.s.
senate
committee
on
foreign
relations,
in
recommending
the
adoption
of
the
1972
treaty,
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
treaty
was
to
benefit
united
states
owned
and
operated
containers.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
certainly
the
same
arguments
were
made
in
both
mcgoldrick
and
xerox,
and
in
mcgoldrick,
in
particular,
the
tax
imposed
was
a
sales
tax.
it
was
a
sales
tax
on
fuel
oil
sold
to
ship
stores
which
could
have
been
taxed
in
other
jurisdictions
under
consumption
taxes.
in
addition,
in
this
particular
situation,
both
mcgoldrick
and
xerox
pointed
out
that,
of
course,
the
state
sales
tax
and
the
state
property
tax
were
not
customs
duties,
but
nevertheless,
the
same
objectives
are
stricken
by
the
tax.
first,
there
really
is
little
difference
in
the
impact
of
a
state
sales
tax
on
container
leases
from
a
customs
duty
on
the
goods
moving
across
the
borders.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
neither
of
those
cases
involved
international
treaties.
they
were
simply
involving
federal
statutes.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
the
statutes
i
don't
think
had
language
of
that
kind
in
them.
they
excepted
the
fuel
oil
and
the
transshipped
goods
from
customs
duties.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
well,
we're
not
only
talking
about
the
treaties.
we're
talking
about
the
implementing
federal
regulation
which
excepts
them
from
customs
duties
and
the
amendment
to
19
u.s.c.
1202,
the
harmonized
tariff
schedules
of
the
united
states.
so,
we're
talking
about
not
only
the
language
of
two
treaties,
but
the
federal
implementing
regulation.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i
think
the
same
deference
is
applied
to
the
interpretation
of
a
regulation,
as
long
as
that
regulation
is
not
at
odds
with
the
delegated
power
from
congress.
and
again,
i
would
point
out
that
the
opposite
position
was
taken
by
the
united
states
in
1978.
the
tennessee
tax--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--the
treaty
provides
that
the
containers
should
be
reexported
within
3
months.
that's
to
provide
the
benefit
of
temporary
admission.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that,
though
i
would
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
federal
customs
bureau
has
waived
that
particular
requirement
and
no
longer
requires
3
months
as
a
matter
of
regulation.
that's
what
the
treaty
sets
forth,
but
the
u.s.
customs
regulations
allow
the
containers
to
remain
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
some
can
come
in
empty,
and
some
can
arrive
full.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
there's
no
question,
justice
stevens,
that
some
of
the
containers
were
present
at
one
of
the
terminals
either
in
memphis
or
chattanooga
or
knoxville
for
some
time
in
a
yard.
these
containers
are
stackable
and
are
set
out
in
a
container
yard.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes,
while
they'll
be
staying
there--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--that's
regulated
by
the
customs
service.
i'm
not
certain
whether
the
current
regulation
is
on
that.
the
treaties
talk
about
3
months,
but
allow
them--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--it
has
been
stipulated
in
this
case
that
all
of
itel's
containers
during
the
audit
period
were
continuously
bonded
and
in
the
stream
of
foreign
commerce
whether
or
not
they
were
temporarily
stored.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
what
that
means
is,
of
course,
there
is
going
to
be
the
necessary
interruption
of
the
movement
of
an
instrument
of
international
traffic
as
it
is
moved
around
the
world
and
engages
in
a
series
of
leases
and
multiple
import-export
moves.
what
congress
sought
through
the
waiver
of
customs
duties
in
this
case
was
to
allow
the
free
movement
of
containers
without
reducing
their
cost,
either
due
to
the
crossing
of
a
border
or
the
imposition
of
tax,
and
certainly
in
this
case,
congress
has
waived
the
benefit
of
quite
a
bit
of
customs
duties:
$178,000
approximately
in
this
case.
and
tennessee's
tax
of
$158,000
nearly
completely
offsets
that
tax.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
in
the
event...
yes,
yes,
that's
true.
in
the
event
that
tennessee
measured
a
particular
service
provided
to
a
container,
both
under
the
treaties
and
under
this
court's
constitutional
law--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--this
court
has
consistently
held,
in
considering
whether
or
not
a
particular
tax
is
a
user
fee
or
whether
it's
a
general
tax,
whether
or
not
that
tax
is
measured
by
the
particular
benefits
that
are
allocated
to
that
individual.
the
keokuk
packett
case,
some
of
the
other
cases
of
this
court
decided
in
the
last
century,
indicate
that
a
user
fee
has
to
be
collected
in
regard
to
particular
services,
not
police
or
fire
protection.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
the
sales
tax
in
this
case
was
measured
by
100
percent
of
the
gross
lease
proceeds
under
the
lease,
and
since
these
containers
were
charged
on
a...
lease
was
charged
on
a
per
diem
basis,
the
total
amount
under
the
lease
wasn't
known
until
the
journey
was
ended.
so
it
would
be
billed
on
a
monthly
basis.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
that
was
in
estimating.
what
you're
referring
to,
justice
white,
is
the
estimation
of
the
number
of
containers
that
were,
in
fact,
leased
within
the
jurisdiction.
there
was
a
projection
done
calculating
the
average
container
days
leased
in
the
audit.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
tennessee
has
made
no
effort
to
apportion
its
tax.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
i'm
trying
to
think
back,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
whether
or
not
there
is
something
in
that
regard.
perhaps
i
can
provide
that
on
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
both,
justice
kennedy.
the
fact
that
there
are,
in
fact,
taxes
which
could
be
imposed
on
these
containers
and
the
fact
that
there
is
an
international
custom
which
respects
these
treaties
and
their
meaning,
as
set
forth
in
the
protest
of
nations
and
in
the
brief
of
the
united
kingdom.
at
this
point,
if
i
can--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
that's
evidence
like
in
the
franklin
mint
case.
the
consistent
interpretation
of
treaties
by
signatory
nations
is
certainly
compelling
evidence.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
yes.
we
certainly
dispute
and
have
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
the
reasons
for
that
dispute.
the
only
tax
identified
by
the
solicitor
general
as
being
supposedly
the
same
is
a
tax
on
the
goods
imported
in
a
container
which
is
paid
only
by
a
person
who
buys
the
goods
as
a
consumer
in
the
european
communities.
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
as
pointed
out
by
the
united
kingdom
in
its
brief,
the
signatory
nations
to
this
convention
have
followed
the
uniform
practice
of
failing
to
impose
taxes
like
tennessee's
for
36
years.
the
position
of
the
united
kingdom
and
the
other
protesting
nations,
which
include
8
of
the
original
12
nations
which
drafted
the
1956
treaty,
have
posed
the
interpretation
of
the
convention
that
is
followed
by
itel.
so
the
deference
that
would
be
ordinarily
given
the
executive
branch
in
interpreting
international
law
is
informed
by
the
interpretations
of
those
nations.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
certainly,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
simply
a
head
count.
the
united
states
was
not
even
a
participant
in
the
drafting
of
the
language
to
this
convention.
they
acceded
13
years
later.
we're
not
contending
that
it's
just
a
principle
of
contract
law.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
there
are
no
cases
construing
that
language.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
they
take
that
position
in
this
litigation,
and
they
have
prevented
containers
from
being
taxed
by
their
own
statutes.
there
is
a
uniform
practice
in
this
case,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
only
example
given
by
the
united
states
wasn't
even
alluded
to
by
tennessee
in
their
brief,
is
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
goods
imported
in
a
container.
and
i
would
like
to
make
this
for
an
example.
if
a
british
steamship
line
leases
a
container
which
is
delivered
in
tennessee
to
export
a
case
or
cases
of
jack
daniels
whiskey
to
london,
certainly
the
taxes
imposed
on
the
container
lessee
by
tennessee
has
to
be
by
the
lessor
and
paid
by
the
lessee.
but
the
import
vat
that
the
united
states
has
raised
in
britain
only
means
that
when
a
customer
at
a
pub
purchases
a
fifth
of
jack
daniels,
he
has
to
pay
an
import
vat
on
the
base
price
as
determined
under
cost,
insurance,
and
freight.
there
is
simply
no
connection
in
that
tax.
there
is
no
disincentive
in
that
tax
to
the
use
of
containers.
it
simply
doesn't
strike
at
the
container
or
the
container
selection
decision.
i
would
also
like
to
respond--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--the
cost
under
the
cif
method
of
valuation,
which
is
adopted,
does
include
the
fraction--
mr.
philip
w.
collier
--of
the
lease
which
is
involved
from
the
travel
from
tennessee
to
the
united
kingdom,
but
that
has
never
been...
that
is
not
a
tax
in
connection
with
the
importation
of
containers.
it
doesn't
fall
on
the
choice.
it
doesn't
affect
the
use
of
containers.
mr.
philip
w.
collier
it
does
not
fall
on
the
container
lessors
or
lessees.
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
