justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
raise
two...
excuse
me...
questions,
i
believe,
and
one
has
to
do
with
youth
and
the
other
with
evidence
of
positive
character
traits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
suppose
there
isn't
a
defendant
in
the
world
that
hasn't
patted
a
dog
or
kissed
a
sibling
or
been
kind
to
a
grandmother
at
some
time
in
their
life.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
how
many
cases
are
there
with
a
death
sentence
pending
now
in
texas--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
fall
under
this
old
statute
where
the
argument
is
made
that
youth
was
a
factor?
