anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems,
mr.
tigar,
that
in
almost
any
case
there's
going
to
be
some
evidence
of
troubled
background,
positive
character
traits,
so
i'm
not
sure
where
the
limits
of
your
rule
are.
i
have
the
same
experience
as
mr.
justice
souter
does.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
rule
for
you
we
have
to
overrule,
if
not
jurek,
certainly
franklin--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
probably
both.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
texas
courts
under
the
old
statute,
other
than
perhaps
in
the
penry
case,
grant
supplemental
instructions
in
any
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
tigar
represented
to
us
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
we
will
not
retreat
from
this.
i
wasn't
sure
if
that
was
pre-penry
or
post-penry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
date
of
the
new
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
'91.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
youth
enter
into
the
determination
of
guilt
initially,
just
in
this
same
way
to
find
that
the
requisite
intent
existed?
that's
duplicated--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
you'd
indicated
that
youth
was
taken
into
account
in
deciding
whether
he's
guilty
to
begin
with...
guilty
of
the
murder.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
back
just
to
the
special
issues.
you
indicated
that
penry
should
or
could
be
clarified.
do
you
have
a
suggestion
or
formulation
to
clarify
penry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
suppose
10
years
goes
by
so
that
a
17-year-old
is
not
sentenced
until
he's
27
years
old,
does
future
dangerousness
then
take
into
account
his
youth
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
4
years
in
this
case
until
he
was
sentenced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
jury
entitled
to
consider
the
strength
of
the
state's
evidence
on
intent?
