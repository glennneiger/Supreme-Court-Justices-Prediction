mr.
charles
a.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
graham's
claim
that
his
jury
could
not
give
mitigating
effect
to
his
constitutional
evidence
is
both
factually
and
legally
insufficient
to
establish
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
it
fails
as
a
factual
matter
because
many
of
the
assertions
on
which
his
legal
theory
is
based
were
not
supported
by
the
record,
and
it
fails
as
a
matter
of
law
under
jurek.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
sure.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i'm
sorry.
one
would
think
that
if
graham's
mitigating
evidence
were
as
compelling
as
he
suggests,
that
it
would
be
included
in
the
join
appendix.
it
is
not.
the
joint
appendix
consists
of
612
pages,
434
of
which
are
devoted
to
voir
dire,
a
matter
that
to
my
mind
at
least
does
not
bear
on
the
question
presented.
graham's
punishment
phase
evidence,
by
contrast,
is
quite
scant.
it
may
be
found
in
the
record
at
volume
20,
pages
474
to
86.
it
occupies
13
pages
of
the
record,
and
would
have
occupied
7
pages
of
the
joint
appendix,
yet
it
is
not
included.
examination
of
the
record
reveals,
i
believe,
the
reason
for
this
omission.
for
instance,
graham
tells
us
that
he
worked
a
job
to
support
his
two
children.
the
basis
for
this
assertion
is
six
lines
of
hearsay
testimony.
there
is
absolutely
no
competent
evidence
in
the
record
that
graham
was
gainfully
employed
or
that
he
supported
his
family.
in
the
same
theme,
graham's
assertion
that
his
17
years
had
been
characterized
by
religious
devotion,
again,
the
only
basis
for
this
assertion
is
four
lines
of
his
grandmother's
testimony
that
he
attended
church
with
her
between
the
ages
of
3
and
11.
she
admitted
that
she
had
no
knowledge
of
his
activities
after
the
age
of
11,
and
there
is
absolutely
no
other
evidence
of
his
supposedly
religious
nature.
as
to
graham's
troubled
childhood,
the
only
basis
for
this
assertion
is
15
lines
of
testimony
from
the
grandmother.
there
is
no
evidence
that
graham
was
mistreated
in
any
way
as
a
child,
and
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
that
any
event
of
his
childhood
contributed
to
make
him
the
extremely
violent
person
he
had
become
at
the
age
of
17.
in
addition,
graham
misconstrues
the
record
of
the
voir
dire
examination
at
his
trial.
while
the
judge
and
counsel
for
both
the
state
and
graham
offered
varying
definitions
of
the
word,
deliberately,
the
trial
court
did
not
in
fact
define
that
word
for
the
venir
members
so
as
to
reduce
the
state's
burden
of
proof.
the
record
shows
that
the
trial
court
repeatedly
advised
the
venir
members
that
the
term
would
not
be
defined
at
trial
and
they
were
to
use
their
own
common
sense
interpretation
of
what
the
word
deliberately
means
in
answering
the
first
special
issue.
to
support
that
statement,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
90,
169,
205,
291,
353,
and
419.
finally,
graham's
assertion
that
the
trial
court's
definition
of
the
term,
criminal
acts
of
violence,
somehow
reduced
the
state's
burden
of
proof
on
the
second
special
issue
is
likewise
reputed
by
the
record.
the
examples
offered
by
the
trial
court
of
relatively
minor
offenses
were
included
in
a
broad
definition
of
that
term,
which
also
referred
to
robbery,
rape,
and
murder.
again,
as
with
the
term,
deliberately,
the
trial
court
told
the
venir
members
that
criminal
acts
of
violence
would
not
be
defined
at
their
trial,
and
as
with
the
term,
deliberately,
the
jurors
would
use
their
own
common
sense
interpretation.
not
only
is
graham's
claim
factually
lacking,
it
also
is
untenable
as
a
matter
of
law
under
jurek.
in
jurek,
this
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
at
issue
here
precisely
because
it
allows
the
jury
to
consider
whatever
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances
the
defense
can
bring
before
it.
the
jurek
court
did
not
believe
that
the
special
issues
were
so
narrow
as
to
foreclose
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence,
but
instead
found
that
they
got
in
focus
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
offender
and
his
offense.
jurek
controls
graham's
claim.
there,
as
here,
the
defendant
was
a
young
person
at
the
time
of
his
offense.
both
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
fifth
circuit
have
held
that
youth
includes
defendants
up
to
the
age
of
23
at
the
time
of
their
offense.
graham
acknowledges,
as
he
must
under
jurek,
that
his
jury
could
give
mitigating
effect
to
his
youth
in
answering
the
second
special
issue,
but
he
claims
that
it
had
relevance
outside
the
scope
of
the
texas
statutory
scheme.
as
the
court
of
appeals
observed,
though,
to
say
that
youth
cannot
be
considered
under
the
special
issues
is
necessarily
to
say
that
any
evidence
to
which
a
defendant
ascribes
mitigating
value
cannot
be
considered.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
my
response
is,
your
honor,
that
examination
of
the
trial
record
reveals
that
youth
was
offered
for
one
purpose
only,
and
that
was
to
show
that
graham
would
not
be
a
future
danger.
although
graham
introduced
no
evidence
of
his
age
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
he
was
tried
5
months
after
the
offense,
and
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
his
apparent
age
at
the
time
of
trial.
in
addition,
defense
counsel
stated
without
objection
that
graham
had
been
17
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
defense
counsel
argued
that
because
of
his
youth
graham
had,
and
i'm
essentially
paraphrasing
his
closing
argument,
had
redeeming
value,
that
he
could
be
rehabilitated,
that
he
would
change,
would
slow
down,
if
his
life
were
spared.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
suggestion
that
graham
wished
for
his
youth
to
be
considered
for
any
other
purpose
at
trial.
the
trial
court
was
not
requested
to
give
the
supplemental
instruction
to
which
graham
claims
he
is
now
entitled.
perhaps
most
damaging
to
graham,
rather
than
whatever
aggravating
quality
might
be
attached
to
his
youth
is
the
fact
that
the
state
proved
that
he
was
a
demonstrably
violent
person,
as
evidenced
by
the
number
of
extraneous
offenses
they
introduced
at
the
punishment
phase
of
trial.
the
state,
as
recited
in
our
brief,
proved
up
a
number
of
robberies
and
rapes
committed
by
graham
over
a
1-week
period.
in
addition,
they
offered
the
testimony
of
a
juvenile
probation
officer
that
graham's
reputation
for
being
a
peaceful
and
law-abiding
citizen
is
bad.
her
evidence...
her
testimony
obviously
supports
the
inference
that
prior
to
this
1
week
in
may
of
1981
he
had
not
been
a
model
citizen.
if,
however,
your
honor,
we
accept
the
definition
of
youth
as
given
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
have
to
consider
it
as
going
all
the
way
up
to
23,
in
which
case
it
falls
apart.
a
23-year-old
defendant
cannot
make
the
same
argument
as
graham
can.
indeed,
a
17-year-old
defendant
who
is...
obtains
a
reversal
of
his
conviction,
is
retried
at
the
age
of
24,
cannot
make
that
argument.
although
graham
acknowledges--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--under
this
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
i
do
not...
there
are
360
pending
cases.
i
do
not
know
at
how
many
of
those
trials
that
argument
was
made.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
360
inmates
on
death
row
in
texas
who
were
convicted
under
the
old
statute.
although
graham
concedes,
as
he
must,
that
jurek
remains--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--your
honor,
i
am
aware
that
that
has
been
done.
i
don't
think
it's
been
done--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--well,
your
honor...
no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
not
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
required
it,
but
i
know
in
at
least
some
cases,
and
i
don't
want
to
misspeak,
i
know
it's
a
very
small
number,
the
trial
court
gave
those
instructions
when
requested
even
though
there
was
no
state
appellate
authority
for
doing
so.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
it
became
effective
september
1st
of
1991.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
although
graham
concedes,
as
he
must,
that
jurek
remains
good
law--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
know...
if
it's
the
case
i
think
it
is,
it
had
to
do
with
excusing
a
defendant's
failure
to
raise
the
issue
at
trial.
in
other
words,
excusing
a
procedural
default,
but
i
will
defer
to
what
mr.
tigar
tells
you
in
that
regard.
as
i
was
saying,
graham
concedes,
as
he
must,
that
jurek
remains
good
law,
yet
he
asks
this
court
to
interpret
penry
in
a
manner
that
can't
be
squared
with
jurek.
as
the
court
of
appeals
observed,
graham's
interpretation
of
penry
is
so
broad
that
it
requires
that
jurek
be
overruled.
viewed
in
that
light,
his
claim
has
failed
because
it
is
a
new
rule
that
would
be
barred
by
teague
v.
lane,
or
in
the
alternative,
if
penry
is
to
be
interpreted
as
graham
urges...
that
is,
to
abrogate
jurek...
then
penry
was
wrongly
decided
and
should
be
overruled.
the
court
need
not
go
that
far,
however.
they
can
decide
this
case
simply
by
doing
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
attempting
to
reconcile
the
two
lines
of
capital
sentencing
precedent
and
by
clarifying
the
holding
of
penry.
as
the
court
has
noted
many
times
in
explaining
the
operations
of
the
texas
statute
and
in
reconfirming
the
validity
of
jurek,
texas
narrows
the
class
of
death
eligibles
at
the
guilt
phase
to
the
statutory
elements
of
capital
murder.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor...
or,
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
his
present
culpability,
his
culpability
for
the
crime
itself,
is
taken
into
account
by
the
jury
at
two
different
stages
of
the
trial:
1)
in
finding
him
guilty
of
the
capital
murder
itself,
because
in
doing
so
it
has
found
him
to
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
and
then
the
second
time,
through
the
first
special
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
committed
the
crime
deliberately.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
that
deliberately
is
not
the
linguistic
equivalent
of
intentionally.
deliberately
is
a
state
of
mind
that
embraces
more
than
a
will
to
engage
in
the
conduct.
it
is
a
mental
process
that
activates
the
intentional
act.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor,
and
it's
also
something
that
necessarily
can
be
considered
under
issue
2,
because
the
jury
knows
and
is
told,
as
it
was
by
graham's
counsel
at
his
trial,
that
he
will
not
remain
a
youth
forever.
he
will
change.
he
will
slow
down.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor,
that
does.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--if
that
was
how
your
honor
understood
me,
i
apologize.
what
i
was
saying
was
that
his
present
culpability
is
determined
at
the
guilt
stage
and
under
the
statute,
of
course,
youth
is
not
a
legal
excuse
for
committing
a
capital
murder,
but
it
is
something
that
can
be
and
has
been
argued
on
the
first
special
issue.
that
is,
the
deliberateness.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
we
would
urge
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
is
a
noble
attempt
to
reconcile
the
court's
two
lines
of
cases.
i
really
can
add
nothing
beyond
that.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
the
special
issues
allow...
the
special
issues,
particularly
the
future
dangerousness
issue,
allow
the
jury
to
consider
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
first
special
issue
does
so
also.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i'm
not
sure
they'd
rest
it
in
just
the
terms
your
honor
has
posed.
what
they
did
say,
and
what
i
would
argue
strenuously
to
the
court,
is
that
there
is
no
showing
that
youth
is
mitigating
other
than
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
offered
at
trial,
and
that
was
in
regard
to
the
future
dangerousness
issue,
and
in
that
regard
we'd
rely
on
boyde,
where
the
court
observed
that
the
mitigating
value
of
evidence
can
be
determined
from
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
offered.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
they
do,
your
honor,
and
again,
it
is
our
position
that
the
first
issue
raises
that.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
wish
to
beat
this
too
much,
but
again,
the
first
issue
focuses
on
present
culpability,
the
second
on
future
dangerousness.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
the
way--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--well,
your
honor,
quite
frankly,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
all
the
nuances
of
mens
re
myself,
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
is,
deliberateness
falls
somewhere
between
premeditation
and
intent,
and
it
involves
some
mental
process
more
than
simply
the
intent
to
do
the
act
but
less
than
deliberated
premeditation.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--i
would
site
firens
v.
state.
it's
a
1981
case,
620
southwest
2d,
577.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
620.
620,
your
honor,
577.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
2d.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
much
can
be
gleaned
from
graham's
brief
in
this
case
where
he
lists
the
qualities
of
youth
that
are
deemed
to
be
mitigating,
and
among
them
is
impulsiveness,
the
inability
to
think
rationally
or
maturely
before
acting,
obviously
deliberate
is
going
to
be
the
converse
of
impulsive,
and
if
a
quality
of
youth
is
impulsiveness,
then
just
as
obviously
the
deliberateness
inquiry
will
encompass
that.
as
i
was
saying
moments
ago,
the
class
is
narrowed
at
the
guilt
phase,
then
we
have
the
punishment
phase
at
which
the
state
bears
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
all
of
the
special
issues.
we
know
from
walton
v.
arizona
that
it
is
permissible
for
the
defendant
to
prove
mitigation
by
a
preponderance.
texas
affords
the
defendants...
its
capital
defendants
much
more
protection
in
that
regard
by
requiring
the
state
to
prove
the
issues
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
defendant
is
allowed
to
introduce
whatever
evidence
he
wishes
in
mitigation,
and
the
jury
normally
is
instructed,
as
it
was
in
graham's
case
at
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
it
is
to
consider
all
the
evidence
presented.
not
only
is
there
no
instruction
limiting
the
jury's
consideration
of
that
evidence,
but
it
is
in
fact
instructed
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
introduced
at
both
phases
of
trial.
penry
simply
held,
we
believe,
that
supplemental
instructions
were
required
in
that
case
to
allow
the
jury
to
give
effect
to
his
mental
retardation
and
childhood
abuse
as
mitigating
factors,
and
that
holding
followed
from
the
recognition
that
although
penry's
evidence
had
mitigating
quality,
that
it
was
essentially
aggravating
as
to
the
future
dangerousness
inquiry.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
i
suppose
to
that
extent
penry's
evidence
cannot
be
considered
within
the
first
special
issue,
either.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
that
the
jury
was
not
able
to
give
full
mitigating
effect
to
his
evidence
within
the
first
special
issue
as
well
as
the
second.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor,
we
will
accept
that
perhaps
chronological
age
does,
but
that
it
has
no
relevance
outside
the
inquiries
posed
by
the
two
special
issues,
the
first
two.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no.
no,
your
honor,
we
accept
that
that's
relevant
and
that
is
a
consideration
as
far
as
mitigating
evidence
goes.
it's
simply
our
position
that
the
special
issues
allow
consideration
of
that
with
regard
to
whether
he
acted
deliberately
and
then
as
to
future
actions,
through
the
second
issue.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
again,
i
would
defer
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
that
is
that
penry
suffered
from
a
uniquely
severe
permanent
handicap.
that
is,
the
standard
the
fifth
circuit
has
enunciated
that
a
capital
defendant
must
satisfy
to
prevail
on
a
penry
claim
and--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
can't
give
you
any
other
answer
than
i
have.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor,
he
was
tried
and
sentenced
5
months
after--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--now,
again,
my
primary
position...
and
forgive
me
for
articulating
it
so
poorly,
is
that
it's
the
first
special
issue
that
focuses
on
the
present
culpability,
but
the
second
special
issue
allows
the
jury
to
give
mitigating
effect
to
his
youth
as
having
the
capacity
for
rehabilitation,
the
capacity
for
rehabilitation
being
an
equally
valid
sense
and
concern
as
his
personal
culpability.
graham
also
argues
that
the
prosecutor
argued
his
youth
as
a
basis
for
a
sentence
of
death.
the
record
does
not
support
this
assertion.
the
argument
which
is
contained
at
page
480
of
the
joint
appendix
simply
stressed
that
graham
is
a
demonstrably
violent
person
and
that
his
past
actions
were
probative
of
his
future
behavior.
the
prosecutor
did
not
argue,
even
remotely
suggest,
that
graham
deserved
to
die
because
he
was
young.
finally,
your
honors,
in
closing
i
would
like
to
respond
to
what
i
would
consider
a
rather
curious
assertion
that
the
act
of
the
texas
legislature
in
amending
the
statute
somehow
lends
validity
to
graham's
claim.
as
an
initial
matter,
i
would
note
that
it
is
incorrect,
as
graham
asserts
at
footnote
11
of
his
reply
brief,
that
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
drafted
and
sponsored
the
new
statute.
in
fact,
the
statute
that
was
passed
is
not
the
one
that
was
drafted
and
supported
by
our
office.
that
matter
aside,
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
the
legislature
acted
prudently
in
responding
to
the
penry
court's
concerns,
and
in
amending
the
statute
they
necessarily
did
so
broadly
enough
to
encompass
the
class
of
penry
excludables.
their
action
in
doing
so,
however,
should
not
be
taken
as
a
concession
as
to
the
validity
of
the
360
remaining
convictions.
i
think
this
assertion
is
perhaps
supported
by
the
fact
that
there
have
been
21
executions
that
have
taken
place
since
penry,
all
under
the
old
statute.
in
closing,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
scope
of
the
decision
in
this
case
far
exceeds
mere
youth.
we
are
seeing...
since
penry
was
decided,
we've
seen
a
number
of
claims
by
capital
defendants
as
to
what
constitutes
mitigating
evidence,
and
included
in
those
are
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
a
sociopath,
a
condition
this
court
has
found
very
aggravating
in
smith
v.
estelle--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--yes,
your
honor.
james
demouchette,
the
last
prisoner
to
be
executed
in
texas,
the
execution
of
which
took
place
last
month,
that
was
precisely
is
submission...
that
he
was
a
sociopath,
that
that
explained
his
actions,
that
he
could
not
control
it,
and
that
therefore
it
was
mitigating
under
the
rule
of
penry.
we've
also
been
told
things
such
as...
by
a
hispanic
petitioner
who
claimed
that
it
was
part
of
hispanic
culture
to
smoke
marijuana
and
to
get
into
fights,
and
that
the
evidence
he
presented
of
that
at
his
trial
was
mitigating.
we've
been...
we've
seen
claims
from
defendants
who
were
brought
up,
they
claim,
to
hate
a
particular
racial
group,
and
therefore
the
acts
of
violence
they
committed
on
members
of
that
group
were
mitigating.
again,
these
claims,
bizarre
as
they
may
seem,
fit
within
the
language
of
henry
in
that
they
explain
the
defendant's
actions
and
they
show
that
he
is
burdened
with
a
condition
over
which
he
has
no
control.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
