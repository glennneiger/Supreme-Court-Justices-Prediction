if
we
accept
that,
do
we
have
to
overrule
jurek,
because
jurek
was
premised
on
the
fact
that
the
moral
significance
could
theoretically
at
least
be
considered
within
the
framework
of
the
questions,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
youth
consideration
could
meet
the
test,
as
you
describe
it,
unless
we
overrule
jurek?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
one
question
on
something
you
haven't
touched
on
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
you
mention
in
your
brief
that
there
is
perhaps
a
theoretical
flaw,
or
at
least
a
theoretical
inadequacy
in
placing
great
reliance
on
the
second
texas
question,
the
prediction
of
future
dangerousness.
because
that
is
basically...
by
its
very
nature
it
is
a
predictive
inquiry,
whereas
the
judgment
which
must
be
expressed
consistent
with
eddings
and
locket
is
a
moral
judgment
about
the
individual
and
the
act,
if
we
accept
the
view
that
the
second
question,
the
predictive
question
is
in
fact
not
a
moral
question,
let's
say
in
a
utilitarian
sense
or
a
moral
inquiry
in
a
utilitarian
sense,
does
it
follow
from
your
argument,
if
we
accept
it,
that
there
will
for
practical
purposes
always
have
to
be
a
penry
kind
of
catch-all
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
good
enough
for
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
going
to
get
to...
did
someone
else
speak?
are
you
going
to
get
to
his
specific
argument
that
in
this
case
he
was
sufficiently
young
so
that
when,
for
purposes
of
the
second
question,
future
dangerousness,
the
jurors
considered
that
youth,
their
likely
response
would
be
that
he
is
so
young
that
even
after
conviction
he's
still
going
to
remain
young,
and
it's
going
to
be
quite
some
time
before
he
outgrows
the
impulsiveness,
violence,
whatever
the
case
may
be,
and
therefore,
considering
youth,
it
really
must
be
considered
as
an
aggravating
factor
rather
than
a
mitigating
one,
with
the
result,
unless
there
is
a
special
penry
kind
of
circuit-breaker
here,
that
there
would
be
no
way
to
consider
the
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor?
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
all
right.
mr.
palmer,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
how
youth
is
considered
under
the
first
question.
as
a
premise
to
asking
you
about
that,
may
i
just
ask
you
to
go
back
a
moment
to
something
that
i
think
i
recall
your
saying
when
you
were
commenting
on
the
manner
in
which
the
texas
courts
have
defined
deliberateness,
and
you
said
they
didn't
simply
equate
it
with
intention.
if
i
remember
what
you
said
correctly,
you
said
that
they
had
defined
deliberateness
or
deliberation
as
the
process
which
leads
to
the
doing
of
an
intentional
act,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
well,
does
it
follow
from
that
that
whenever
an
intentional
act
has
been
committed
that
it
must
therefore
have
been
a
deliberate
act,
or
the
result
of
deliberation?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
think
i
understand
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
isn't
merely
an
element
leading
to
an
intentional
act,
it
is
some...
in
some
sense
it
is
a
further
mental
element
in
addition
to
intentionality--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
it
has
been
so
defined
by
the
texas
courts.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is...
i
don't
mean
to
put
you
on
the
spot
here,
but
could
you
give
me
a
cite
to
a
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
which
they
have
so
construed
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
6--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
now,
with
that
as
a
premise,
would
you
explain
to
me
how
youth
comes
into
the
consideration
of
deliberateness?
is
it
in
the
sense
that
a
young
person
is
thought
to
be
less
capable
of
engaging
in
this
kind
of
deliberative
process,
is
that
the
point?
