mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice
of
the
united
states,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
gary
graham
was
17
years
old
and
the
product
of
a
profoundly
troubled
family
background
when
he
struggled
with,
shot,
and
killed
bobby
grant
lambert
in
the
supermarket
parking
lot.
his
case,
and
the
issues
presented
today,
must
be
resolved,
we
suggest,
by
reference
to
precedent,
experience,
and
tradition.
precedent,
in
the
guise
of
locket
and
eddings,
yes,
and
stanford
v.
kentucky,
in
which
the
court
has
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
powerful
mitigating
force
of
youth,
and
yes,
precedent
in
the
sense
of
penry
v.
lynaugh,
because
this
case,
we
submit,
is
stronger
for
us
than
penry's
was
for
him
because
of
the
role
of
youth
in
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
because
of
the
presence
here,
as
in
eddings,
of
the
potentiating
force
of
the
family
background
coupled
with
the
evidence
of
youth.
and
it
is
weaker
for
the
respondent
than
their
position
was
in
penry,
not
simply
because
penry
has
in
the
interim
been
decided,
not
simply
because
the
prosecutor
here,
as
in
penry,
sought
to
make
the
second
texas
special
issue
into
a
double-edged
sword
by
arguing
that
the
condition
in
fact
made
the
defendant
more
dangerous,
but
also
because
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
told
the
jury
over
and
over
again
in
voir
dire,
or
voir
dire,
whatever
one
prefers,
that
they
were
to
consider
the
special
issue
language
in
ways
that
cabined,
confined,
and
constricted
those
special
issues,
cabined
and
confined
them
so
there
was
no
chance
that
the
promise
of
jurek
could
be
redeemed.
jurek
was
premised
on
a
promise.
the
court
said
that
it
appeared
the
state...
that
the
jury
could
consider
certain
things
and
the
court
said
that
right
after
a
paragraph
in
which
it
enumerated
age
as
among
the
things
it
thought
of
constitutional
significance.
that's
the
promise
that
has
not
been
redeemed.
that
is
why
judge
higginbotham
in
the
court
below
said
that
this
case
is
governed
by
precedent,
so
i
turn
to
the
issues
that
the
jury
had
before
it,
those
special
issues
1
and
2,
because
those
are
the
significant
ones.
special
issue
number
1
has
to
do
with
deliberateness,
and
yet
the
trial
judge
told
the
jury
that
that
meant
nothing
more
than
intentionality.
that
is
to
say,
the
same
element
of
the
offense
of
which
gary
graham
then
stood
convicted,
because
that's
the
element
under
6.02(a)
of
the
texas
penal
code
that
is
a
part
of
first
degree
murder.
special
issue
2,
future
dangerousness...
here,
as
in
penry,
both
double-edged
and
under-inclusive.
it's
double-edged
because
gary
graham
is
17.
he
has
a
longer
time
before
he
got
old
enough
to
outgrow
the
kinds
of
behavior
the
trial
judge
said
satisfied
future
dangerousness:
doing
wheelies
with
your
harley
on
a
lawn,
pouring
paint
on
a
car...
those
sorts
of
relatively
trivial
offenses.
double-edged
because
there
is
in
this
court's
cases
a
deep
and,
we
say,
rationally-based
social
consensus
that
youth
is
mitigating
in
and
of
itself.
that
is
to
say,
that
it's
mitigating
beyond
what
it
may
have
in
terms
of
predictive
ability.
the
prosecutor
emphasized
the
double-edged
point
by
saying
as
the
seed
is
planted
so
grows
the
sprout,
as
the
twig
is
bent,
so
grows
the
tree.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
justice
souter,
we
do
not
ask
you
to
overrule
jurek,
any
more
than
the
state
asks
you
to
overrule
penry.
no.
penry
said
there
would
have
to
be
an
additional
instruction
beyond
the
special
issue,
and
all
jurek
says
is
that
the
jury
may
be
asked
to
consider
whatever
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
jurek
didn't
say
that
it
had
to
be
within
the
special
issues,
and
the
problem,
justice
souter,
is
created
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
in
black
v.
state
says,
we
will
not
retreat
a
millimeter
back
from
the
language
of
the
special
issues.
we
won't
authorize
giving
any
extra
instructions.
it's
futile
to
ask
for
them.
so
no,
we
don't
think
that
jurek
should
be
overruled,
and
in
fact
the
court's
opinion
in
franklin
stands
as
a
testament
that
under
certain
circumstances,
perhaps
many,
jurek
and
what
this
court
said
in
jurek,
what
it
said
in
later
cases,
can
live
quite
happily
together
without
questioning
jurek.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
justice
kennedy--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--at
the
margin,
there
are
surely
cases
in
which
these
issues
are
raised...
for
example,
in
boyd
v.
california
or
franklin
itself.
this
is
a
case
of
a
17-year-old
whose
mother
was
in
and
out
of
mental
hospitals
20
or
30
times.
so
i
look
to
eddings,
which
is
the
closest
case,
and
see
if
maybe
there's
an
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court
that
answers
your
question,
and
i
think
it
does.
the
court
there
identified
two
things.
first,
factors.
the
eighth
amendment
mandates
that
certain
factors
shall
be
considered
as
mitigating,
and
youth
is
surely
among
them
if
we
take
stanford.
a
troubled
family
background
surely
is
among
them.
then
the
question
is,
if
the
factor
has
been
identified,
what
evidence,
and
the
eighth
amendment
also
mandates
that
the
defendant
be
able
to
put
on
evidence.
now,
surely,
once
the
state
has
done
that
job
as
it
has
done
in
the
three
statutes
that
the
state
in
this
case
clings
to
as
good
ones...
saffle,
blystone,
and
boyde...
then
we
say
that
there
can
be
a
question,
the
threshold
question,
as
to
whether
the
evidence
proffered
entitles
the
defendant
to
an
instruction
that
as
whether
the
evidence
goes
to
or
sufficiently
relates
to
one
of
the
constitutionally
identified
mitigating
factors.
that's
a
common
question
in
all
kinds
of
criminal
cases
in
those
not
involving
the
eighth
amendment.
the
court
started
its
opinion
in
jacobson,
for
example,
by
noting
that
if
the
evidence
has
been
different,
jacobson,
quote,
would
not
even
have
been
entitled
to
an
instruction.
the
court's
been
wrestling
with
that
threshold
issue
ever
since
the
19th
century,
and
we
suggest
that
those
standards
could
be
applied
here.
but
the
third
way,
and
this
is...
in
which
the
evidence
is
under-inclusive
is
precisely
because
of
eddings,
that
very
powerful
analysis,
particularly
in
footnote
11,
about
the
consensus
that
adolescents
tend
to
be
dangerous,
particularly
in
the
teenage
years,
that
there's
a
sense
that
it
maybe
society's
fault.
not
that
that's
dispositive,
or
that
you
or
i
or
any
of
us
would
say
that
it
is
in
a
particular
case,
but
that
the
sentencer,
in
the
words
of
eddings,
locket
requires
the
sentencer
to
listen.
that
comes
back
to
the
jurek
point.
penry
says
you
need
an
additional
instruction.
that's
consistent
with
jurek,
and
why?
because
of
what
the
court
said
in
griffin,
which
is
not
a
capital
punishment
case.
in
griffin
the
court
said
juror
intuition
takes
care
of
a
lot
of
problems
about
what
the
facts
are,
but
we
certainly
do
not
expect
juror
intuition
to
be
able
to
deal
with
what
the
law
is.
that
won't...
their
intuition
can't
save
them
from
the
failure
of
the
court
to
instruct
correctly
on
the
law.
and
another
analogy
that
we
draw
that
we
think
is
powerful
is
last
term's
decision
in
morgan
v.
illinois.
if
seating
one
juror
who
says,
i
ain't
following
those
mitigating
instructions,
is
an
error,
how
much
more
of
an
error
is
it
if
the
judge
says
in
effect
to
the
jurors,
you
can't
consider
the
mitigating
evidence,
which
is
what
was
said
here?
because
when
the
judge
had
finished
with
his
constricted
view
of
the
law,
the
last
thing
he
said
to
this
jury
before
they
deliberated
the
fate
of
this
17-year-old
young
man
was,
you
take
your
law
from
me.
your
other
judge
is
the
facts,
but
you
take
your
law
from
me.
beyond,
then,
the
issue
of
precedent,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
missed
the
eddings
point
interestingly,
the
respondent
doesn't
embrace
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
we
deal
with
in
our
brief.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
mistaken
a
reweighing
of
evidence
for
this
constitutional
duty
under
eddings
to
look
at
the
factors
that
are
mitigating
and
make
sure
the
jury
hears
about
the
factors.
the
second
element,
if
the
court
please,
is
experience,
and
by
experience
i
mean
the
power
that
this
court
has
traditionally
recognized
attaches
to
evidence
of
youth,
and
that
runs
through
many
of
the
cases.
gary
graham
was
17
when
he
killed
bobby
grant
lambert.
nathan
leopold
was
18
when
he
killed
his
victim.
and
gary
graham
doesn't
say
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
leopold's
result
any
more
than
he
has
the
right
to
an
advocate
as
eloquent
as
leopold's
advocate,
but
he
does
have
the
right
to
have
his
sentencer
free
to
consider
the
power
of
this
mitigating
evidence
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
identified
as
powerful
in
the
way
that
this
court's
decisions
teach.
the
whole
life
of
childhood,
said
leopold's
counsel,
is
a
dream
and
an
illusion,
and
whether
they
take
one
shape
or
another
depends
not
upon
the
dreamy
boy
but
upon
what
surrounds
him,
evidence
that
evokes
what
justice
powell
said
for
the
court
in
footnote
11
in
eddings.
i
suggest
they
want
you
to
forget
as
justices
that
which
you
know
as
lawyers
who
have
tried
and
presided
over
cases,
that
which
you
know
as
men
and
women,
and
that
that
judge
higginbotham
in
his
dissent
identified
as
the
power
of
this
evidence
based
on
his
experience
as
an
able
trial
lawyer
and
a
trial
judge
before
he
went
on
the
court
of
appeals.
and
of
course,
beyond
experience
there
is
tradition.
that's
one
reason
i
say
that
the
case
is
stronger
for
us
than
penry's.
the
mitigating
power
of
youth
is
recognized
in
our
legal
tradition
for
at
least
2,200
years,
and
we
can
trace
it
back
that
far.
in
stanford
v.
kentucky
this
court
called
out
the
roll
call
of
the
states.
it
began
by
saying
that
one
sure
guide
to
the
eighth
amendment
duty
of
the
court
is
to
look
at
statutes
passed
by
society's
elected
representatives,
and
then
the
court
called
out
in
this
roll
call
29
states
that
expressly
make
youth
a
mitigating
factor...
29.
and
then,
having
done
that,
it's
clear
from
stanford
and
from
reading
the
statutes
of
the
other
states
that
if
they
don't
mention
youth
expressly
that
they
all
have
one
of
these
catch-all
clauses,
catch-all
mitigating
clauses
that
the
court
has
sustained
in
such
cases
as
boyde
and
blystone
and
saffle
that
permit
the
lawyers
to
argue
it
without
being
headed
off
at
the
pass
by
prosecutorial
or
judicial
argument.
now,
in
response
to
these
contentions
that
we
make,
the
state
does
a
number
of
things.
it
has
some
statistics.
we
didn't
bother
to
answer
those
in
our
reply
brief
because
they
formed
no
part
of
the
record
below
and
we
think
that
the
court
ought
not
to
consider
them,
that
had
they...
not
having
been
subjected
to
adversary
scrutiny,
they
don't
belong
in
the
case.
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
if
you
move
the
age
from
23
to
24,
that
the
alleged
disparity
shrinks
to.5
percent
instead
of
whatever
they
say
it
is.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
there
are
82,
not
81
youths
that
got
the
life
sentence,
so
their
arithmetic
is
off,
and
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
if
you
run
the
elementary
statistical
test
of
the
null
hypothesis,
that
the
results
cannot
be
attributed
to
anything
more
significant
than
chance.
but
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
that.
the
question
might
also
arise
in
the
court's
decision,
well,
what
should
we
do
about
marginal
cases?
what
does
age
mean,
because
that's
in
the
court
of
appeals.
our
contention
is
this:
that
age
means
that
at
least
the
teenage
years
as
identified
in
eddings,
that
the
fifth
circuit
says
22,
the
state
is
willing
to
say
23,
and
that
time
enough
to
resolve
that
question,
because
the
states
are
answering
it.
this
is
a
case
of
a
17-year-old,
and
as
to
17-year-olds,
as
to
the
mitigating
force
of
youth
for
them,
after
penry,
oregon
and
texas
stood
alone.
oregon
quickly
changed
its
practice
and
then
its
statute,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
texas
then
amended
its
statute
with
the
aid
of
lawyers
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
indeed,
the
reason
for
that
amendment
is
not
hard
to
find
when
one
reads
the
stunning
concession
at
page
28
of
the
attorney
general's
brief.
that
is
to
say,
the
statutory
terms
at
issue
relate
to
matters
that
might
support
affirmative
answers
to
the
special
issues,
i.e.,
aggravating
factors
that
have
no
logical
connection
to
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
rational
jury
could
give
effect
to
graham's
mitigating
evidence.
in
short,
the
state
seems
to
be
saying
that
the
factors
are
probably
on
their
face
more
adapted
to
the
aggravators,
and
that
additional
instructions
as
required
in
penry
might
be
the
answer
to
redeeming
the
jurek
promise,
that
under
those
circumstances,
particularly
when
you
have
the
instructions
in
an
as-applied
way
constricted
and
confined
by
the
trial
judge's
instructions
and
by
the
prosecutor's
argument,
there's
no
chance
that
the
mitigating
force
of
this
evidence
could
have
been
appreciated
by
the
jury.
if
we
are
to
go
back,
then,
to
that
most
objective
and
reliable
indicium...
that
is
to
say,
what
the
states
have
done...
it
is
clear
that
this
is
a
little
like
coker
v.
georgia,
where,
as
the
court
noted
in
stanford,
georgia
stood
alone.
here,
texas
stands
alone,
but
within
its
own
house
it
is
divided
against
itself,
for
by
its
legislative
enactment
it
has
recognized
that
the
mitigating
evidence
that
could
not
be
considered
under
the
former
statute
must
now
be
given
a
chance
to
be
heard
by
the
sentencer.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
true.
we
were
asking
the
court
to
illuminate
what
it
means
by
the
word
character
in
the
character
on
record
and
then
circumstances
of
the
offense
language.
character
evidence
is...
of
course,
is
not
receivable
unless
it
passes
some
minimal
threshold
of
relevance.
that
comes
back,
we
believe,
to
the
factors
evidence.
here,
the
positive
character
traits
must
be
considered...
again,
eddings
i
think
is
our
best
case...
because
these
positive
character
traits
existed
despite
the
troubled
family
background.
that
is,
some...
i
don't
think
that
hitchcock
comes
out
as
it
does
just
because
mr.
hitchcock
is
a
kind
uncle.
i
think
mr.
hitchcock's
kind
uncleness
is
important
because,
after
a
lifetime
of
adversity,
he
still
manages
to
do
that,
and
here
mr.
graham
loves
the
lord,
cares
for
the
children
that
he
had,
and
shows
these
traits
despite
what's
happened
to
him.
so
we
say
that
whatever
the
threshold
is,
we
meet
it,
but
also
looking
to
such
cases
as
boyde,
in
which
the
court
has
quite
frankly
assessed
the
relevance
of
the
evidence
to
a
factor
already
identified
and
said
that
there
might
be
some
threshold
that
somebody
would
have
to
meet,
that
that
standard,
or
that
analysis
would
permit
the
court
to
draw
a
line.
our
view
is
that
wherever
the
line
is
drawn,
we
have
to
disagree
with
the
fifth
circuit,
because
on
this
record
the
combination
of
circumstances
is
even
more
powerful
than
the
eddings
combination
as
to
which
the
court
said
you
had
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole
and
that
the
sentencer
there
was
not
authorized
to
just
focus
on
you.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
it
does
not,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
franklin
is
the
answer
to
that.
franklin
did
not
contend
that
his
evidence,
however
characterized,
did
more
than
help
the
jury
answer
no
to
the
second
question,
so
that
there
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
said,
it's
adequate.
the
concession
the
state
makes
at
page
28
of
its
brief,
however,
troubles
me,
as
your
question
troubles
me.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
problem
is
this,
that
maybe
it's
true,
and
the
court
could
conclude
that
the
second
question
simply
isn't
adequate
to
that
purpose.
that
is,
in
this
calculus
of
which
you
speak,
it
really
is
an
aggravator
only,
as
the
state
seems
to
suggest.
then
all
that
would
mean,
however,
is
that
in
order
to
redeem
the
promise
of
jurek,
the
state
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
have
to
moderate
its
language
a
little
bit,
and
instead
of
saying
things
like,
we
will
never
retreat,
it
would
have
to
pay
attention
to
what
this
court
made
the
quid
pro
quo
for
upholding
the
statute
on
its
face
in
jurek.
that
is
to
say,
to
accommodate
the
statute
to
circumstances
that
are
presented
to
it,
the
state
had
this
opportunity
and
has
repeatedly
refused
to
avail
itself
of
it.
it
was
one
reason
why
the
claim
couldn't
conceivably
be
procedurally
defaulted,
because
it
was
so
cleared
of
futility,
but
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
well,
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
sorry,
i
was
trying
to
get
my
paper
graded,
and
that
was
very
improper
of
me
to
do
that.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
we
have
a
watershed
difference
here
about
what
the
jury
was
told
in
this
case
as
to
special
issue
number
1
and
the
intent
element
of
the
offense,
and
something
of
a
difference
about
texas
law.
i'd
like
to
try
to
resolve
it.
at
pages
6
and
7
of
our
brief,
quoting
from
the
joint
appendix,
we
have
extensive
quotations
from
the
voir
dire
as
to
what
the
jurors
were
told:
deliberately
means
that
in
my
mind
anyway
it
is
a
person's
intention
to
do
something,
and
other
remarks
to
the
same
effect.
at
joint
appendix
5,
we
have
the
jury
instructions
given
in
the
guilt
phase.
intentionally,
or
with
intent
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
his
conduct,
or
to
a
result
of
his
conduct
when
it
is
his
conscious
objective
or
desire
to
engage
in
the
conduct
or
cause
the
result.
now,
all
that
complicated
language
does
is
read
out
section
6.02(a)
of
the
texas
penal
code,
which
differs
from
the
model
penal
code
quadripartite
intent
elements
only
in
that
texas
chooses
to
use
the
word
intention
rather
than
purposefulness,
which
is
the
more
preferred
model
penal
code
formulation,
but
then
when
it's
defined,
it's
the
same
thing.
it's
in
terms
of
this
conscious
objective
or
desire,
so
there
can't
be
any
doubt
that
the
trial
judge
conflated
these
two
standards
and
thus
took
care
of
any
mitigating
force
that
might
have
been
in
special
issue
number
1.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
standard
of
proof,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
same
with
respect
to
both
of
the
elements,
so
that
there
really
isn't
any
opportunity
for
the
jury
to
do
other
than
look
again
to
the
same
things
they
looked
at
plus,
of
course,
to
the
additional
aggravating
evidence
when
they
get
on
to
the
punishment
phase.
that's
the
difficulty.
then
we
look
at
black
v.
state.
now,
that's
a
post-penry
decision,
and
there's
a
defendant
up
in--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--no,
it
doesn't
justice
white.
that's--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--that's
correct,
justice
white,
and
we
might
lose...
might
have
lost
this
case
if
the
defendant
were
25
years
old.
i
mean,
if
the
case
were
a
different
one
than
it
was
at
the
margin
as
opposed
to
right
in
the
center,
then
there'd
be
a
different
result.
that's
the
meaning
of
an
as-applied
challenge,
and
if
i
may
interrupt
my
black
v.
state
discussion,
that's
what
we
think
is
wrong
with
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
turns
penry
on
its
head,
because
it
doesn't
look
at
this
question
of
youth
in
its
relationship
to
the
very
thing
that
the
court
identified
in
eddings
as
central.
instead,
it
goes
off
on
this
future
dangerousness
thing
and
analyzes
it
in
that
regard
and
then
gets
to
the
result
that
it
gets
to.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
of
course
not,
justice
rehnquist.
of
course
not.
i
mean,
this
court
said
in
eddings
how
this
is
to
be
done.
there
are
these
constitutionally
mitigating
factors,
and
then
there's
an
assessment
of
the
evidence
standard.
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
boyde
v.
california
should
teach
anyone
foolhardy
enough
to
come
up
here
what's
going
to
happen
to
them
if
they
make
an
argument
of
that
kind,
so
i
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
worry
about
that.
the
problem
is
that,
of
course,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
will
decide
those
cases
and
presumably
the
court
won't...
won't
want
to
hear
them.
the
problem
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
black
case
is
that
at
page
364
they
say,
unless
your
name
is
penry
and
you
took
the
same
iq
test,
what
they
say
we
will
not
retreat
means
no
additional
jury
instructions.
it's
futile
to
ask
for
them.
no
procedural
bar.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
could
be,
perhaps,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that
was
the
promise
of
jurek.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
well,
they
promised
in
jurek
they
were
going
to
do
it
and
then
they
didn't,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
difference
between
the
facial
and
as-applied
challenge.
to
look
at
it
more
broadly,
in
stanford
v.
kentucky
the
court
wrote
an
opinion.
you
counted
the
statutes.
you
looked
at
the
29
states
that
said,
let's
put
youth
in
there.
29
is
surely
more
of
a
constitutional
consensus
than
that
found
inadequate
in
stanford
and
yet
not
quite
so
much
as
the
one
you
had
in
coker,
so
i
think
that
it's
a
fair
question
whether
you
have
to
say
youth
or
whether
under
one
of
these
catch-all
statutes
it
would
be
adequate
to
those
purposes.
and
the
final
observation
i
would
make
is
that
we
are
told
that
mitigating
evidence
didn't
take
up
very
many
pages
in
the
transcript.
the
fifth
circuit
accepted
it
for
what
it
was,
so
that
issue
has
been
resolved.
the
hearsay
point,
i
wonder
where
trial
counsel
for
the
state
was,
or
for
the
district
attorney.
it
wasn't
objected
to.
the
point
about
youth
is
that
it
only
takes
a
word
in
the
transcript...
he's
17...
and
the
evocative
power
of
it
in
our
law
life
for
2,200
years
of
recorded
legal
history
has
been
enough
for
sentencers
to
say,
oh,
he
is?
that's
mitigating.
and
that,
if
the
court
please,
is
our
respectful
submission.
