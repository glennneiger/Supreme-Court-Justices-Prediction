justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
the
timing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
opponent
cited
black
v.
state,
which
i
haven't
read.
what
is
the
significance
of
that
case
in
this
time
sequence?
it's
a
1991
case,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wasn't
it
also
true
that
there
was
some
emphasis
in
the
opinion
on
the
lesser
moral
culpability
for
a
mentally
retarded
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
that
extent,
i
guess--
--excuse
me,
you
suppose
to
that
extent,
what?
i'm
having
trouble
hearing
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
that
extent
isn't
that
case
somewhat
similar,
at
least,
to
this
case,
in
that
at
least
under
justice
white's
questioning
you
suggested
that
youth
may
reduce
the
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant,
but...
oh,
you
take
the
position
it
does
not
reduce
the
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant.
the
chronological
age
does
not,
but
mental
age
might.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
reduced
moral
culpability
of
the
defendant
has
no
relevance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
special
issues
do
allow
adequate
consideration
of
reduced
moral
culpability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
why
wasn't
that
a
satisfactory
answer
in
penry?
that's
what
i'm
not
clear
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
the
relevance
of
that
when
you're
predicting
future
dangerousness,
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
why
that
seriously
distinguished
the
two
cases
on
moral
culpability.
