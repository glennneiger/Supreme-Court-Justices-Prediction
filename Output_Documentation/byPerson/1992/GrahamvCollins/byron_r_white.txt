justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
youth
is
not
a
mitigating
factor
in
the
sense
that
it
reduces
the
culpability
of
the
offender
for
having
committed
the
offense.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
that
is...
if
culpability
for
the
crime
that's
been
committed
were
a
mitigating
factor
the
second
question
the
jury
has
to
answer
does
not
reflect
that.
it
goes
only
to
future
dangerousness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
deliberately
just
means
intentionally,
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
to
the
extent
that
it
is
claimed
that
a
youth
as
compared
with
an
adult
is
really
not
in
full
control
of
himself,
that
may
be
considered
under
issue
1.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that,
but
that
has
to
do
with
the
future.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it...
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
youth
in
terms
of
culpability
at
all?
i
thought
it
just
said
as
long
as
youth
could
be
considered
a
factor
in
future
dangerousness,
which
it
can,
that
was
as
far
as--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
deal
with
the
notion
of
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor
in
the
sense
of
less
culpability
for
committing
the
crime
that
he's
committed?
did
the
court
of
appeals
talk
about
that,
other
than
by
saying
you
don't
need
to...
you
don't
need
a
special
instruction
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
opinions
of
this
court,
perhaps
some
that
i
haven't
joined,
really
refer
to
culpability,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
plenty
of
support
in
the
cases
that
youth
is
a
factor
that
is
fairly
considered
in
terms
of
culpability.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tigar,
your
argument
that
you
just
made
that
in
this
case
the
judge
conflated
this
and
that,
i
suppose
that
doesn't
go
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
texas
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
might
win
this
case,
but
if
the
trial
judge
had
spoken
differently
you
might
lose
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
be
that
mental
retardation
is
such
a...
so
likely
in
every
case
to
affect
somebody's
control
that
you
just
have
a
per
se
rule
about
it
that
you
have
to
have
a
separate
instruction,
but
just
being
useful,
maybe
it
ought
to
be
decided
on
a
case-to-case
basis,
which
arguably,
at
least
texas
argues,
is
amply
taken
care
of
in
issue
1.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
some
other
case.
