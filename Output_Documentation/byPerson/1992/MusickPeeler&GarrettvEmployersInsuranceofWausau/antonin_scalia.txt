did
we
ever
pretend
when
we
created
the
10(b)
cause
of
action
that
congress
intended
that
cause
of
action
to
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
under
a
lampf
kind
of
analysis,
having
created
10b-5
actions,
which
you
might
say
without
any
express
indication
of
congressional
intent,
why
shouldn't
we
continue
to
round
out
the
scheme
without
any
indication
of
congressional
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
point
to
be
tried,
though,
isn't
it,
or
not...
whether,
indeed,
their
conduct
made
them
liable
for
this
damage?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
such
a
terrific
approach,
why
have
we
abandoned
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
everything
except
10(b)?
