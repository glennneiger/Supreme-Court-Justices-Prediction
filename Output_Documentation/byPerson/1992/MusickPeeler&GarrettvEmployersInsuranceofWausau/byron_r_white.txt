justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
footnote
sort
of
grandfathered
the
implied
cause
of
action
under
10(b).
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
contribution,
just
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
we're
just...
we
think
we'd
just
be
off-base
if
we
tried
to
devine
what
congress'
intention
might
be
if
it
thought
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
congress...
don't
you
think
congress
has
embraced
the
notion
of
a
cause
of
action
under
10(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer's
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
plain
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
said
in
comparable
sections...
maybe
you
don't
think
they're
comparable...
that
there
should
be
contribution.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
were?
what
if
9
and
18
you
could
say
are
sort
of
fellow
travelers
with
10(b)
and
congress
has
expressly
provided
for
contribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
did
it
for
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
always
is.
[laughter]
no,
but
why?
you
said
that
we
had
no
choice,
that
we
had
to
come
up
with
some...
we
didn't
have
to
pick
a
statute
of
limitations.
we
could
have
said,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
there
are
such
things.
just
the
law
of
laches
governs,
and
nothing
else.
why
couldn't
we
have
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if,
in
developing
intent-based
jurisprudence,
would
you
say
that...
just
have
a
real
simple
rule,
congress
either
provides
a
cause
of
action,
or
you
just
never
imply
one?
i
suppose
that
would
be
your
choice.
you
either
imply...
congress
either
expressly
creates
it,
or
courts
don't
imply
it,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we're
going
to
be
constantly,
as
we
have
been
for
years,
trying
to
divine
congressional
intent
from
almost
any
source.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
contribution
between
defendants,
or
contribution
from
nonparty
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
are
people
who
weren't
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
what
underlies
that
policy
choice
in
these
other
sections,
or
under
10b-5.
why
is
the
commission
so
intent
on
furnishing
retribution
in
10(b)
cases...
or,
retribution?
contribution.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
that
work
out?
you
mean
these
people
who
are
jointly
and
severally
liable,
if
somebody
gets
stuck
for
the
whole
bill
it's
fairer
to
dig
out
the
other
fellows
who
should
share
the
liability,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
our--
--i
suppose
you
could
always
be
fair
by
just
limiting
recoveries
to
the
named
defendants'
fair
share.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you...
would
you
guess
that
most
plaintiffs
would
be
in
favor
of
the
commission's
suggested
policy...
contribution?
would
they
rather
have
contribution
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
because--
