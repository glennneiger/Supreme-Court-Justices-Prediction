justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
first
of
all,
you
don't
really
draw
a
distinction
between
whether
the
contribution
claim
is
asserted
after
a
judgment
or
after
settlement
or
before,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure,
because
then
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
you
call
them
plaintiff
or
defendant
in
that
context.
but
what
about
the
reasoning
in
the
blue
chip
case,
where
you
talked
about
the
acorn
growing
into
a
judicial
oak,
and
that
therefore
it's
too
late
to
chop
the
oak
down,
in
effect.
don't
we
in
a...
to
a
certain
extent
have
a
judicial
oak
here,
in
that
courts
of
appeals
have
rather
consistently
found
a
right
of
contribution
over
the
years,
and
that's
sort
of
what
the
law,
with
one
exception,
is
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
certainly
more
than
an
acorn,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
and
there
have
been
for
a
good
many
years.
and
it's
a
hard
nut
to
crack,
too.

justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bird,
what
point
in
time
do
you
think
congress'
intent
is
relevant
when
you're
talking
about
intent-based
standards,
back
in
'34,
or
more
recently?
because
all
the
way
back
to
'34,
the
general
rule
was
if
they
passed
the
statute,
why,
they
expected
the
judges
to
figure
out
the
appropriate
remedy,
so
i'm
wondering
whether
you're
talking
about
intent
in
'34,
or
intent
since
we
changed
the
law
a
few
years
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we're
looking
at
'34.
