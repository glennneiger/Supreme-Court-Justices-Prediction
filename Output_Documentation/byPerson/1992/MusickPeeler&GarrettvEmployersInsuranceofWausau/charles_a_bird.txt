mr.
charles
a.
bird
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
implication
of
a
cause
of
action
for
contribution
in
a
federal
statute.
the
statute
in
question
is
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act.
it
is
a
statute
in
which
courts
have
previously
implied
a
cause
of
action
for
people
who
suffer
losses
as
a
result
of
purchases
or
sales
of
securities
where
the...
as
a
result
of
damage...
or,
pardon
me,
as
a
result
of
violations
of
section
10(b).
my
theme
today
is
simple.
the
court
should
apply
its
intent-based
jurisprudence
of
implied
rights,
a
standard
which
respondents
concede
they
cannot
meet
when
asked
to
apply
a
cause
of
action
for
a
contribution
in
a
statute
in
which
a
victim's
civil
claim
has
previously
been
implied.
respondents
and
their
amici
assert
that
the
court
should
apply
a
different
line
of
cases.
that
is,
a
line
of
cases
involving
fleshing
out
the
victim's
remedy
itself.
my
burden
today
is
to
show
that
a
contribution
claim
is
a
separate
claim,
and
it
should
be
treated
as
any
other
potential
implied
right
of
action
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
implied
contribution
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
request
for
an
implied
action,
first,
because
this
court
has
said
so.
in
the
northwest
airlines
and
texas
industries
cases,
the
unsuccessful
petitioners
made
arguments
which
are
indistinguishable
from
the
arguments
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
court
treated
contribution
there
as
an
implied
claim
over
those
arguments.
in
texas
industries,
the
petitioner
asserted
that
contribution
was
not
at
all
a
new
cause
of
action,
but
only
a
supplement
to
the
victim's
express
remedy
in
that
statute
for
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
respondent...
petitioner
in
that
case
also
argued
that
contribution
was
a
necessary
corollary
to
judicial
creation
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
joint
and
several
liability
among
violators
of
that
law,
and
amici
in
that
case
actually
argued
that
contribution
was
somehow
within
the
penumbra
of
the
statute
itself.
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
in
almost
any
statutory
scheme,
courts
may
have
to
interpret
ambiguous
or
incomplete
provisions,
but
the
authority
to
construe
a
statute
differs
fundamentally
from
the
authority
to
fashion
new
remedies.
the
court
also
said
that
the
judicial
determination
that
defendants
shall
be
jointly
and
severally
liable
does
not
suggest
that
courts
have
the
power
to
order
contribution
among
the
defendants,
for
joint
and
several
liability
only
assures
that
the
victims
whom
congress
intended
to
protect
shall
have
full
recovery
from
some,
if
not
all,
of
the
perpetrators.
were
there
any
lingering
doubt
that
somehow
texas
industries
and
northwest
airlines
differed
from
this
court's
general
jurisprudence
of
implied
rights
of
action,
i
would
suggest
that
was
put
to
rest
last
year
in
footnote
6
of
franklin
v.
gwinnett
county
public
schools,
where
the
court
cited
all
of
those
cases
as
a
single
line
and
said
that
it's
intent-based
jurisprudence
shall
apply
to
all
such
cases.
implied
contribution
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
request
for
an
implied
claim,
second,
because
contribution
is
a
distinct
action
and--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--that
footnote
did
not
discuss
the
implied
contribution
under
section
10(b).
mr.
charles
a.
bird
the
implied
cause
of
action
under
10(b)
itself
was
grandfathered
as
far
back
as
bankers
life.
i
think
the
court
has
accepted
the
fact
that
lower
courts
have
adopted
that
implied
cause
of
action
for
victims
and
repeatedly
in
a
number
of
cases
the
court
is
fleshed
out
that
cause
of
remedy,
but
as...
the
court
is
never
addressed
the
issue
whether
there
shall
be
implies
contribution.
contribution
is
a
separate
action
because
it
always
involves
a
different
plaintiff,
and
that
different
plaintiff
is
someone
whose
claim
has
not
been
recognized
that
different
plaintiff
is
someone
who
is
always
a
perpetrator
of
a
violation
of
the
statute,
always
a
member
of
the
class
that
congress
intended
to
regulate,
never
a
member
of
the
class
that
congress
intended
to
protect.
second,
contribution
very
often
involves
a
different
defendant.
even
if
contribution
is
sought
in
the
same
action
where
the
victims
seek
their
compensation
third
party
practice
permits
other
parties,
other
defendants
to
be
brought
in
by
contribution
actions,
and
often,
as
is
the
case
here,
contribution
brings
to
federal
court
a
new
suit.
implying
contribution
truly
extends
federal
jurisprudence
to
embrace
a
dispute
which
congress
has
not
assigned
the
federal
courts
to
resolve,
and
that
is
a
dispute
for
adjustment
of
damages
among
defendants
as
opposed
to
a
suit
for
compensation
by
a
victim.
unless
congress
tells
the
federal
courts
that
it
wants
them
to
embrace
that
dispute,
to
reach
out--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--no,
justice
scalia,
you
acquiesced
in
the
lower
court's
10b-5
cause
of
action
under
standards
which
differ
profoundly
from
the
standards
that
this
court
now
uses
to
determine
whether
there
shall
be
implied
rights
of--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--contribution
is
not
rounding
out.
there
is...
the
rounding-out
cases,
of
which
lampf
is
one,
start
from
the...
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
court
must
reach
an
answer.
to
illustrate
with
an
example
even
simpler
than
lampf,
the
court
cannot
walk
away
from
the
question
whether
the
standard
for
liability
under
section
10(b)
shall
be
negligence,
shall
be
scienter.
the
court
cannot
say,
well,
congress
didn't
instruct
us
on
this
so
we
simply
won't
answer
the
question.
there
is
absolutely
no
need,
in
rounding
out
the
victim's
cause
of
action,
to
develop
an
entirely
new
jurisprudence
of
what
should
be
the
rights
of
perpetrators.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
do,
your
honor,
very
much
so.
i
believe
the
kind
of
analysis
which
exists
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
case
is
a
kind
of
analysis
in
which
this
court
should
never
indulge
in
the
process
of
deciding
whether
to
create
a
cause
of
action.
the
question
is
an
attempt...
your
honor
put
it
very
succinctly.
what
would
congress
have
done
if
it
had
known?
that
is
not
an
effort
to
determine
legislative
intent,
it
is
an
effort
to
impute
intent
to
a
mind
which
had
none
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
believe
congress
has...
beyond
any
question,
has
embraced
the
notion
that
victims
of
violations
of
section
10(b)--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--yes.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
yes.
congress
has
said
that
victims
shall
have
a
cause
of
action
against
perpetrators
it
has
seen
and
approved
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
it
has
not
said
in
any
way
whatsoever
that
perpetrators
shall
have
remedies
against
each
other
to
adjust
what
they--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--i
do
not
believe
they
are
comparable,
though
i
would--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--i
would
still
argue
that
the
court
should
not
engage
in
that
kind
of
reasoning
by
analogy
that
says
well,
congress
did
it
here,
and
congress
did
it
there,
so
congress
would
have
done
it
if
it
had
only
known.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
but
that
was
an
entirely
different
situation,
your
honor
where
you
were--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--the
analysis
in...
you
could
have,
but
you
did
not.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
the
court
did
not
do
that,
your
honor.
the
analysis
in
lampf
commences
with
a
phrase
which
says,
"excepting
that
some
limitation
must
apply.
"
and
by
saying
that
this
court
squarely
placed
the
analysis
of
lampf
within
the
same
line
of
cases
that
says,
we
will
determine
what
is
the
standard
of
liability,
that
says,
we
will
determine
whether
purchasers
or
sellers
or
perhaps
someone
else
shall
have
a
cause
of
action.
that
was
not
the
creation
of
the
cause
of
action.
it
is
not
a
form
of
reasoning
which
should
be
applied
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
because
initially,
your
honor,
you
do
not
approach
these
people
as
defendants.
you
approach
these
people
as
plaintiffs.
they
have
brought
to
court...
and
this
case
is
a
classic
illustration.
they
have
brought
to
court
a
lawsuit
separate
from
the
victim's
lawsuit,
in
which
they
assert
an
entirely
new
cause
of
action
against
new
defendants.
that
is
an
extension
of
federal--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--justice
souter,
that
is
an
issue
of
pure
policy.
they
can
make
that
argument.
the
fundamental
question
is
whether
the
federal
courts
should
entertain
an
argument
of
pure
policy
when
what
is
before
them
is
the
question
whether
congress
authorized
a...
the
courts
to
create
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
i
do
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
your
honor,
you
do
not.
contribution
in
federal
security...
in
10b-5
cases
at
this
point
is
not
a
judicial
oak.
what
the
court
is
being
asked
to
do
here
is
to
plant--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
perhaps
it's
a
little
sapling,
but
it
certainly
does
not
have
the
dignity
that
the
10b-5
cause
of
action
had
when
it
reached
this
court
in
bankers
life,
nor
does
it
have
even
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
that.
when
this
court
first
met
the
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
10(b),
it
had
been
recognized
by
far
more
courts,
including
the
courts
of
appeal,
and
it
also
had
an
underpinning
that
that
cause
of
action
was
implied,
under
whatever
theory
of
jurisdiction,
for
the
very
people
investors,
who
were
the
people
to
be
protected
when
congress
enacted
section
10(b).
this
is
not
a
class
of
people
who
were
to
be
protected
when
congress
enacted
section
10(b).
congress
enacted
section
10(b)
as
an
extremely
broad
regulatory
statute,
not
simply
the
disclosure
statute
which
the
court
sees
most
often.
there
is
no
reason
to
suggest
that
in
attempting
to
regulate
disclosures
markets
and
anything
else
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
thought
was
necessary
to
protect
the
public
and
investors
congress
intended
to
do
anything
to
adjust
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
perpetrators
of
violations
of
the
section.
implied
contribution
also
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
implied
action,
because
abandoning
the
intent-based
jurisprudence
in
this
case
is
bad
judicial
policy.
the
real...
if
the
real
intent-based
standard
is
abandoned,
federal
courts
will
face
countless
arguments
like
the
colloquy
we
have
just
had
here
suggesting
that
through
some
reasoning
by
analogy,
or
some
principle
of
equity,
some
party
is
entitled
to
assert
a
cause
of
action
because
some
other
party
is
entitled
to
do
so.
this
reasoning
by
analogy
is
like
looking
at
legislative
history
through
dark
glasses.
two
things
are
true
of
it--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--or
at
all,
but
in
this
case
certainly,
first
it's
obscure,
and
second,
what
one
sees
depends
on
the
color
of
the
glasses,
because
whenever
the
court
begins
trying
to
create
causes
of
action
by
analogy,
the
question
is,
what
analogy
is
valid?
the
validity
of
an
analogy
depends
on
adopting
the
same
premises
that
congress
adopted
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
and
the
sort
of
reasoning
which
is
being
urged
on
this
court
today
is
a
kind
of
reasoning
which
attempts
to
create
intent
in
congressional
minds
which
was
not
there.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
justice
kennedy,
there
were.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
state
law
would
allow
contribution
for
certain
purposes.
in
california,
it's
called
comparative
equitable
indemnification.
the
claims
alleged
in
state
law
in
this
case
were
dismissed
by
the
district
court
at
the
same
time
that
all
other
claims
were
dismissed
and
there
would
remain
an
issue
in
the
district
court,
upon
dismissal
of
the
10b-5
or
10(b)
attempted
contribution
claim,
whether
any
of
the
state
law
claims
would
be
valid.
the
state
law
claims
obviously
are
not
here
before
this
court.
a
second
critical
issue
of
judicial
policy
in
applying
the
intent-based
standard
is
that
any
time
the
court
departs
from
it,
especially
with
respect
to
a
right
of
contribution,
that--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--well,
the
court
has
uniformly
applied
its
intent-based
jurisprudence
looking
at
the
intent
when
the
statute
was
created.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
you
would
be
looking
at
'34,
your
honor,
although
that's
one
of
the
very
issues
that
comes
up
once
one
starts
to
reason
by
analogy,
and
that
is,
what
congress
does
one
look
at?
the
secondary
jurisprudence
in
this
case
already
includes
what's
the
effect
of
partial
settlement
without
guidance
of
congress,
whether
contribution,
if
allowed,
would
be
pro
rata
or
by
relative
fault,
some
guidance
by
congress
in
section
11
of
the
1933
act,
none
any
place
else.
in
this
very
case,
if
one
were
to
look
to
sections
9
and
18
and
say
well,
congress
might
have
done
the
same
thing,
in
any
case
where
there
is
both
a
section
10
claim
and
a
1933
section
11
claim,
it's
possible
for
the
section
10
contribution
analysis
utterly
to
overwhelm
the
plain
language
of
section
11,
which
says
that
those
who
were
intentional
wrongdoers
shall
not
have
contribution
against
those
whose
violation
was
recklessness
or
of
some
lesser
character.
and
i
think,
justice
stevens,
although
in
general
one
would
look
at
1934,
it
is
certainly
valid
in
this
case
to
say,
once
one
gets
into
the
analysis
of
contribution,
should
we
look
at
section
20a
and
see
if
in
section
20a,
which
congress
passed
in
1988.
it
had
learned
something
about
whether
contribution
was
efficacious
or
not,
and
explicitly
declined
to
adopt
it
as
part
of
the
insider
trading
act.
i
think
that
secondary
jurisprudence
is
one
which
cautions
this
court
not
to
attempt
to
create
causes
of
action
for
contribution
where
they
did
not
exist
before.
the
court
should
set
a
clear
and
simple
principle
to
apply
to
requests
for
implied
contribution
wherever
the
court
has
previously
accepted
an
implied
victim's
cause
of
action.
this
is
not
the
only
case
in
which
a
request
for
implied
contribution
could
come
to
the
court.
it
could
arrive
in
the
commodity
exchange
act,
it
could
arise
under
title
ix,
it
could
arise
under
the
rehabilitation
act...
perhaps
most
importantly,
in
terms
of
volume
impact
on
the
federal
court,
it
could
arise,
it
has
arisen,
it
has
created
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
under
the
civil
rights
act,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
take
the
opportunity
in
this
case
to
write
clear,
simple,
principled,
intent-based
jurisprudence
which
will
guide
the
lower
federal
courts
in
all
of
those
cases
and
prevent
the
necessity
for
resolving
them
on
a
case-by-case
basis
using
the
kind
of
analysis
that
comes
out
of
hypotheticals.
the
court
has
never
fleshed
out
one
implied
right
with
another.
this
is
not
the
first
time
to
do
it.
i
would
urge
that
the
court
in
this
case
ask
itself
the
question,
in
writing
a
decision
in
this
case,
is
this
the
end,
or
is
it
a
beginning?
the
entire
fleshing
out
line
of
cases
defines,
it
often
limits,
a
section
10(b)
cause
of
action.
or
is
this
a
beginning?
is
it
the
planting
of
an
oak,
or
perhaps
the
cultivation
of
what's
now
only
a
sapling,
does
this
case
shape
an
old
claim,
or
does
it
create
a
new
claim?
emphatically,
this
case
creates
a
new
claim
which
this
court
should
not
recognize.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my--
mr.
charles
a.
bird
--that
goes
beyond
the
court's
current
rule,
and
i
would
not
urge
that
the
court
has
to
adopt
a
position
that
is
that
strict.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
what
i've
urged,
justice
white,
is
that
the
court's
jurisprudence
under
the
touche
ross
and
transamerica
line
of
cases
is
a
currently
successful
analysis
which
provides
adequate
guidance.
if
the
court
were
to
choose
to
say,
if
it's
not
in
the
statute
it's
not
there,
that's
certainly
a
sustainable
basis
to
decide
this
case.
it's
not
a
necessary
basis.
mr.
charles
a.
bird
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
contribution
is
a
new
cause
of
action
whether
the
underlying
victim's
claim
is
expressed
in
a
statute,
implied
in
a
statute,
or
arising
from
the
common
law.
that
is
a
simple
error
i
believe
i
heard
one
of
the
respondents
make.
respondents
referred
to
footnote
11
in
the
texas
industries
case.
in
footnote
11,
the
court
wrote,
"we
intimate
no
view
as
to
the
correctness
of.
"
and
followed
with
citation
to
the
three
cases
which
then
said
there
would
be
contribution
in
10b-5
actions.
if
contribution
in
10b-5
actions
is
a
sapling,
it
was
never
cultivated
by
this
court.
complexity
of
contribution
is
an
issue
of
policy.
fleshing
out
a
new
cause
of
action
for
contribution
is
an
article
1,
article
3
problem.
that
is
our
point.
finally,
this
case
is
at
the
intersection
of
two
lines
of
authority.
one
line
of
authority
says
that
as
to
all
causes
of
action
there
shall
be
implication
if,
in
a
federal
statute,
if,
and
only
if,
congress
clearly
and
affirmatively
intended
that
that
be
so.
another
line
of
cases
says,
we
have
this
10b-5
victim's
cause
of
action.
we
must
flesh
it
out,
and
because
we
have
no
other
signpost,
we
must
look
to
what
congress
would
have
done
if
congress
had
realized
there
was
going
to
be
this
cause
of
action.
the
question
is
which
of
those
lines
of
authority
shall
govern
the
cause
of
action,
if
any,
for
contribution
under
section
10b-5.
the
would-have-done
analysis
is
exactly
what
got
this
court
to
the
borak
cause
of
action,
and
it
is
exactly
what
this
court
rejected
in
touche
ross,
in
transamerica
mortgage
advisers,
in
texas
industries,
and
in
northwest
airlines,
and
it
is
exactly
what
this
court
should
reject
here.
from
this
intersection,
the
court
should
say
the
intent-based
jurisprudence
implies...
applies
to
all
implied
causes
of
action,
whether
for
contribution
or
for
anything
else.
thank
you.
