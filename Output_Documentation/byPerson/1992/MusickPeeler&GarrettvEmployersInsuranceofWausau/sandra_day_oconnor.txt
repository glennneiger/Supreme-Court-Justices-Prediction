well,
mr.
olson,
though,
don't
texas
industries
and
northwest
airlines
indicates
that
a
contribution
action
is
separate?
it's
separate
from
the
underlying
cause
of
action--

--which
might
move
it

mr.
long,
do
you
think
in
recent
cases
we've
said
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
create
causes
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
might
think
that
if
congress
has
expressly
created
the
cause
of
action
and
we
lack
the
power
to
create
a
right
of
contribution
that
a
fortiori
there
wouldn't
be
such
a
right
if
it's
only
an
implied
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
new
cause
of
action,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
step
beyond
questions
about
whether
there
should
be
a
statute
of
limitations
or
a
defense.
