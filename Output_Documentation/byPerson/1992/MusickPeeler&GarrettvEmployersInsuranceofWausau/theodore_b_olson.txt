mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
first
to
place
the
question
presented
in
this
case
in
its
proper
context
and
then
emphasize
four
points
concerning
its
resolution.
the
context
is
that
for
22
years,
and
over
the
course
of
10
decisions,
this
court
has
been
engaged
in
a
continuous
process
of
defining
the
configurations
and
contours
of
the
10(b)
implied
remedy
to
make
it
consistent
with
the
regulatory
scheme
from
which
it
is
derived.
this
case
is
simply
part
of
that
continuum.
the
court
must
decide
how
10(b)
defendants
will
allocate
among
themselves
the
damages
for
which
10(b)
makes
each
of
them
liable.
the
only
question
is
how
that
issue
will
be
decided:
in
favor
or
against
contribution
among
10(b)
defendants.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
contribution
among
the
persons
who
would
be
liable
to
the
plaintiff
under
section--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
are
people
who
may
not
necessarily
have
been
parties,
but
people
whose
liability
was
established
by
the
conduct
that
gave
rise
to
the
10(b)
action
or
in
the
comparable
securities
act
express
remedies,
the
violation
of
section
9,
section
18,
and
section
11.
there
are
four
reasons,
we
submit--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
would
be,
but
their
liability
would
be
established
by
the
conduct
that
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
violation
of
section
10(b).
we
submit
that
there
are
four
reasons
why
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
the
choice
congress
has
already
made
require
a
decision
in
favor
of
contribution
over
no
contribution.
the
first
relates
to
the
means
by
which
the
decision
should
be
made,
the
second
is
the
outcome
that
that
method
ordains,
the
third
responds
to
petitioner's
central
argument,
and
the
fourth
concerns
the
consequences
of
a
decision
against
contribution.
first,
the
methodology.
petitioner
suggests
that
there's
some
sort
of
dichotomy
between
divining
the
intent
of
congress
and
filling
out
the
contours
of
the
section
10(b)
remedy.
we
submit
that
the
court
has
applied
a
consistent,
fundamental,
jurisprudential
principal
in
defining
the
10(b)
remedy.
the
court
looks
to
the
73rd
congress,
the
interrelated
'33
act
and
'34
act,
to
the
express
statutory
remedies
that
are
the
analogues
of
section
10(b),
and
then
decides
what
congress
would
have
intended
had
it
considered
the
issue,
and
what
result
would
conform
the
10(b)
implied
remedy
most
faithfully
to
the
statutory
regime.
this
approach,
we
submit,
has
three
very
strong
and
powerful
virtues.
it
respects
the
separation
of
powers,
leaving
the
policymaking
decision
to
the
policymaking
branch.
it
yields
consistent
results
by
consulting
with
the
same
oracle
on
each
occasion
a
10b-5
issue
or
a
10(b)
issue
is
presented,
and
it
provides
a
clear
and
predictable
path
for
lower
courts
deciding
future
10(b)
cases
as
well
as
guidance
for
those
who
must
litigate
past
inventions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you
have
not
abandoned--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
submit
that
the
court
has
considered
10(b)
cases...
10
10(b)
cases
over
the
last
22
years,
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
that
precise
methodology,
visited
most
recently
2
years
ago
in
lampf,
involved
that
same
process,
consulting
the
statutory
framework
from
which
10(b)
arose,
the
analogue...
most
comparable
provisions
of
the
section
comparable
to
section
10(b)
section...
in
that
case
section
11,
section...
and
particularly
section
9
and
18
of
the
1934
act,
and
that
is
the
methodology
that
the
court
applied.
the
court
applied
a
similar
and
virtually
identical
methodology
to
the
other
10(b)
cases,
so
far
from
abandoning
any
approach
that
the
court
has
applied
in
10(b)
cases,
we're
asking
the
court
consistently
to
do
what
it
has
done
over
and
over
again
and
what
it
did
most
recently
in
lampf.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
have--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i've
several
responses
to
that.
that
is
the
central
and
exclusive
core
to
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
reference
in
those
two
cases
to
the
phrase,
cause
of
action,
was
not
necessary
to
the
decisions
in
either
of
those
two
cases.
what
the
court
was
doing
in
those
two
cases,
we
respectfully
submit,
and
the
court
did
unanimously,
was
look
to
the
intention
of
congress.
in
each
of
those
cases,
congress
had
created
an
explicit
statutory
remedy,
and
in
each
of
those
cases
congress
had
not
included
a
cause
of
action
or
a
claim
or
a
remedy
for
contribution
as
a
part
of
the
explicit
cause
of
action.
as
a
result,
the
court
determined
congress
created
this
cause
of
action
explicitly,
did
not
want
contribution
as
a
part
of
it,
and
we
will
adhere
to
the
judgment
of
congress.
the
phrase,
cause
of
action,
really
had
very
little
to
do
with
it.
what
we
submit
is
what
is
happening
in
the
securities
act...
and
by
the
way,
in
the
northwest
airlines
case
the
court
said
specifically
when...
in
a
footnote,
the
court
specifically
said,
when
congress
did
want
to
create
a
cause
of
action
or
a
remedy
or
a
right
for
contribution,
it
did
so,
and
the
court
in
that
footnote
pointed
explicitly
to
the
securities
laws,
the
'33
and
'34
acts.
those...
the
rule
of
contribution
explicitly
provided
in
the
securities
acts
is
very
unusual
in
federal
law.
there
are
very
few
explicit
rights
to
contribution.
thus,
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
included
a
rights...
rights
to
contribution
in
the
securities
acts.
in
fact,
in
section
11
and
in
section
9
and
in
section
18,
the
reference
to
contribution
is
included
in
the
definition
of
the
right
or
the
remedy
itself,
thus
suggesting
that
congress
felt
that
contribution
was
a
part
of
the
cause
of
action
or
a
part
of
the
remedy,
and
suggesting
that
congress
felt
that
that
contribution
right
was
an
important
essential
feature
of
the
remedy
itself.
thus,
we
don't
believe
that
contribution
is
a
separate
cause
of
action,
but
even
if
it
were
a
separate
cause
of
action,
the
very
same
methodology
would
apply.
the
court
would
try
to
determine
whether
implying
the
cause
of
action,
if
that's
what's
going
to
be
done,
would
be
most
consistent
with
the
statutory
framework.
we
submit
that,
again,
it
would
be
most
consistent
with
the
statutory
framework,
because
every
time
the...
when
congress
did
create
a
mechanism
for
securities
fraud
in
1933
and
1934,
it
repeatedly
put
contribution
as
a
part
of
those
rights.
this
court
has
determined
over
and
over
again
that
the
provisions
to
which
i've
referred
are
most
like
section
10(b).
section
10(b)
is
a
part
of
them,
it's
a
judicial
overlay
to
section
10(b).
in
the
same
rules
congress
would
have
wanted
to
include
a
right
of
contribution
in
a
10(b)
remedy
just
as
it
did...
it
wanted
to
include
a
right
of
contribution
with
respect
to
the
sections
11,
9,
and
18
remedy.
probably
most
telling
is
the
consequences
of
what
might
occur
if
the
court
were
to
hold
a
noncontribution
right
in
this
case.
because
section
10(b)
is
an
overlay
to
these
explicit
securities
act
provisions,
the
parade
of
horribles
that
the
plaintiffs
refer
to
about...
that
result
allegedly
from
contribution
are
going
to
exist
anyway.
petitioner's
concern
about
the
complexity
in
settlements
and
so
forth
we
submit
is
going
to
occur
anyway
because
contribution
does
exist,
it
will
exist,
and
it
will
continue
to
exist
in
section
10b-5
cases
because
sections
9,
11,
and
18
are
also
going
to
be
involved
in
those
cases.
in
fact,
what
would
happen
if
this
court
adopted
a
no-contribution
rule
in
section
10(b)
cases,
it
would
give
the
plaintiffs
a
choice
to
write
out
of
existence
the
contribution
rights
that
congress
so
explicitly
intended.
in
10(b)
cases
or
in
securities
fraud
cases,
you'd
have
a
choice
of
the
plaintiff
to
select
contribution
or
no
contribution.
because
section
10(b)
overrides
everything
else,
if
the
plaintiffs
chose
to
select
10(b),
it
could
write
out
the
provisions
of
contribution
that
exist
in
sections
9,
11,
and
18.
thus,
you
would
involve...
as
a
result
of
the
judicial
creation
of
section
10(b),
involve
yourself
in
a
judicial
implied
repeal
of
the
contribution
rights
that
congress
so
explicitly
intended.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you
don't
have
to
elect,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
could
do
that.
plaintiff
could
do
that,
and
then
you
would
have
what
the...
the
concern
that
the
plaintiff
is
worried
about,
that
you
would
have
complexity
involved
in
contribution.
you're
going
to
have
a
further
complexity
of
the
court
having
to
resolve
contribution
and
noncontribution
in
the
same
case
and
try
to
assign
the
amount
of
liability
that
was
a
result--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
it
could
be
used
by
a
plaintiff
as
a
repealer
to
avoid--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
he
elects,
but
congress,
when
it
established
a
mechanism
for
enforcement
through
private
remedies
of
securities
fraud
clearly
wanted
contribution
to
be
a
part.
contribution
ensures
that
the
wrongdoers
cannot
completely
escape.
even
if
the
plaintiffs
don't
select
out
the
wrongdoers,
the
defendants
may
select
out
the
wrongdoers.
in
addition
to
that,
as
this
court
indicated
in
bateman
eichler,
there's
affirmative
value
in
the
enforcement
process
to
allow
the
wrongdoers
to
sue
one
another.
it
allows
them,
the
defendants,
to
bring
cases
against
other
potential
defendants
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
possible
violations
of
the
securities
laws.
that's
why
the
securities
&
exchange
commission
has
filed
a
brief
and
is
here
today
supporting
the
inclusion
of
contribution,
because
contribution
is
such
a
necessary...
as
perceived
by
congress,
inclusion
in
the
securities
act.
if
you
give
plaintiffs
an
opportunity
to
repeal
contribution,
and
plaintiffs
may
well
choose
to
decide
not
to
plead
violations
of
the
statute
that
do
involve
contribution
because
they
may
decide
that
may
give
them
some
leverage
against
some
of
the
defendants,
or
they
may
decide
to
dismiss
some
of
the
cases
if
they
can
make
a
deal
with
some
of
the
defendants
because
of
joint
and
several
liability.
that
would
allow
section
10(b),
the
nocontribution
rule
of
section
10(b)
to
be
used
as
a
judicial
implied
repeal
of
the
contribution
rights
in
the
other
sections.
furthermore,
a
decision
against
contribution
would,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
in
his
questions
a
moment
ago,
overturn
25
years
of
consistent
lower
court
case
law.
until
a
few
months
ago,
when
the
eighth
circuit
decided
the
chutich
case,
there
was
25
years
of
consistent
law.
now,
earlier,
we...
there
was
some
debate
by
mr.
bird
as
to
the
size
of
the
judicial
oak.
it's
interesting,
and
i
think
quite
compelling,
that
when
section
10(b)
got
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
in
1971,
it
was
25
years
old.
it
had
first
been
recognized
25
years
before
in
the
kardon
case.
in
the
blue
chip
case,
when
this
case
first
reached
the
birnbaum
rule,
that
rule,
which
came
from
the
second
circuit,
was
22
years
old,
and
the
blue
chip
case,
in
the
words
of
the
chief
justice
speaking...
justice...
then
justice
rehnquist,
speaking
for
the
court,
was
that
the
25
years
of
consistent
judicial
interpretation
should
not...
was
significantly
persuasive
in
and
of
itself.
today,
we
are
facing
the
decision
with
respect
to
contribution
or
no
contribution.
contribution
has
been
around
in
the
federal
courts
in
the
securities
fraud
area
for
25
years,
the
same
length
of
time,
and
with
about
the
same
judicial
pedigree...
mr.
bird
said
contribution
hadn't
been
approved
by
as
many
courts
as
section
10(b)
at
the
time
section
10(b)
got
here,
but
there
are
seven...
five
or
six
circuits
that
have
approved
contribution,
and
i
suspect
the
weight
of
judicial
authority
is
about
the
same.
the
same
is
true
of
the
birnbaum
rule.
so
the
contribution
rule
comes
to
this
court
with
the
same
weight
of
judicial
authority
behind
it
from
the
lower
courts
as
did
the
10(b)
rule
itself
and
the
purchaser-seller
rule
found
by
the
court
to
continue
to
be
appropriate
in
the
blue
chip
case.
in
summary,
the
choice
is
an
outcome
consistent
with
congressional
intent
as
expressed
in
section
10(b)'s
closest
analogues,
with
25
years
of
judicial
interpretation,
the
sec's
view
of
the
enforcement
scheme
and
how
it
can
best
be
administered,
and
the
framer's
decision
as
to
where
policy
decisions
should
be
made.
the
alternative
cannot
possibly
be
said
to
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
in
fact,
it
would
repeal
congressional
decisions,
and
it
would
fail
to
fulfill
this
court's
duty
to
complete
the
task
it
undertook
beginning
in
1971
to
make
the
section
10(b)
remedy
as
close
as
possible
to
the
instrument
congress
would
have
created
and
as
compatible
as
possible
with
the
regulatory
and
enforcement
regime
congress
did
create.
to
summarize,
we
are
only
asking
this
court
to
do
what
the
court
has
consistently
done
with
section
10(b).
having
created
the
judicial
remedy,
what
are
its
configurations
and
contours
going
to
be,
and
how
can
we
best
make
it
more
closely
approximate
what
congress
would
have
intended
and
how
may
we
make
it
the
closest
possible
approximation
to
what
will
not
interfere
with
the
enforcement
provisions
of
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
securities
act
and
how
best
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
those
acts?
thank
you.
