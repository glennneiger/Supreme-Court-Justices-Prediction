justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
doesn't...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead,
please.
no,
go
ahead.
why
doesn't
this
form
of
reasoning
apply?
one
of
our
sort
of
rounding-out
theories
is
that
if
there
is
in
fact
a
class
of
plaintiffs
who
are
given
an
implied
cause
of
action,
and
there
are
other
potential
plaintiffs
who
are
in
essentially
the
same
equitable
kind
of
position
that
we
ought
to
round
out
and
extend
to
that
second
group
of
plaintiffs,
why
don't
we
have
sort
of
the
converse
situation
here...
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
group
of
defendants
who
are
in
some
comparable
position
and
have
a
right
of
contribution,
then
we
ought
to
round
out
our
cause
of
action
to
do
the
same
thing
for
defendants
under
10(b)?
as
justice
white
referred
a
moment
ago
to
the
section...
what
is
it,
the
section
9
and
section
18
causes
of
action,
there
is
contribution.
why
isn't
the
same
equitable
argument
for
the
sake
of
defendants
an
appropriate
argument
to
make
here
as
the
equitable
argument
in
the
case
of
plaintiffs
that
we
recognized
in
virginia
bankshares?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
may
i
just
interrupt
you
and
ask
this:
if
we
get
over
the
question
of
whether
to
call
them
plaintiffs
or
whether
to
call
them
defendants,
do
they
not
have
essentially
the
same
equitable
argument
to
make:
we
are
in
a
worse
position
than
those
who
have
been
subjected
to
express
causes
of
action
where
express
rights
of
contribution
apply,
and
therefore
we
ought,
as
a
matter
of
equity,
be
accorded
the
same
right,
whether
you
call
us
a
plaintiff
or
whether
you
call
us
a
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
be
within
the
plaintiff's
own
power?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
mean,
if
the
plaintiff
suffers,
it's
the
plaintiff's
own
fault--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
justice
white's
hypothesis.
