mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
concluded
that
the
court
should
recognize
a
right
of
contribution
under
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5.
the
commission
has
made
that
conclusion
for
essentially
two
reasons.
first,
congress
provided
for
contribution
in
provisions
of
the
1934
act
that
create
express
private
rights
of
action
for
securities
fraud,
that
is,
sections
9
and
18.
because
section
10(b)
is
part
of
a
family
of
rights
that
should
be
construed
as
a
coherent
whole,
congress'
decision
to
recognize
a
right
to
contribution
in
the
comparable
express
causes
of
action
should
govern
in
actions
under
section
10(b).
second,
the
court
has
the
power
to
recognize
a
right
of
contribution.
the
section
10(b)
right
of
action
is
an
implied
right.
defendants
are
liable
under
section
10(b)
only
because
courts
have
said
so.
in
prior
cases,
this
court
has
defined
the
contours
of
the
section
10(b)
right
of
action
to
maintain
evenhanded
administration
of
the
securities
laws.
the
court
can
and
should
exercise
that
power
in
this
case
to
recognize
a
right
to
contribution.
now,
let
me
address
the
second
point,
the
power
point,
first.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
we
have
here
is,
we
would
agree
this
is
a
cause
of
action,
but
it's
not
an
independent
cause
of
action.
contribution
is
entirely
derivative
of
the
underlying
section
10(b)
cause
of
action.
the
parties
are
all
parties
who
either
were
present
in
the
original
action
or
they
could
have
been
present
if
the
plaintiff
had
named
them,
and
the
liability
is
the
liability
that's
established
in
the
original
action.
so
we
do
not
view
this
as
a
case
in
which
it's
appropriate
to
apply
the
texas
industries
or
northwest
airlines
type
of
analysis.
that
analysis
is
appropriate
where
congress
has
expressly
created
a
cause
of
action
but
has
omitted
a
right
of
contribution.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again,
the
approach
the
court
has
followed
is
when
it
has
implied
the
cause
of
action
it
has
undertaken
the
necessary
process
of
defining
the
contours
of
that
action
of
rounding
it
out,
and
where
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
a
right
of
contribution,
we
see
no
essential
difference
between
answering
that
question
and
answering
the
kinds
of
questions
that
this
court
has
answered
in
many
prior
cases
under
section
10(b),
whether
to
recognize
a
defense,
the
measure
of
damages...
this
is
really,
we
think,
just
another
question
in
that
line.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it's
a
step
beyond
in
that
sense,
but
again,
i
would
emphasize
this
is
quite
different
from
implying
a
freestanding
cause
of
action.
and
in
the
situation
the
court
is
presented
with
here,
when
section
10(b)
really
sits
among
some
express
causes
of
action
that
congress
created,
where
congress
expressly
recognized
rights
of
contribution
and
section
10(b)
not
only
sits
in
the
middle
of
those
but
in
fact
is
a
kind
of
catch-all
that
overlaps
to
a
great
degree,
for
the
court
to
not
imply,
or
not
recognize
a
right
of
contribution
we
think
would
in
fact
be
less
respectful
to
the
intent
of
congress
than
to
apply
the
same
policy
choice,
the
same
weighing
of
policy
considerations
that
congress
made
in
1934.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
commission
reached
this
conclusion
because
it
decided
as
a
matter
of
fairness
and
as
a
matter
of
evenhanded
administration
of
the
securities
laws
that
a
contribution
right
ought
to
be
recognized
under
section
10(b).
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
part
of
it.
it
is...
under
section
10(b),
a
very
wide
variety
of
defendants
may
be
sued,
and
there
may
be
quite
a
range
of
responsibility,
and
it
is
possible
for
a
defendant
with
a
deep
pocket
but
with
rather
less
serious
culpability
to
be
stuck,
as
you
say,
for
the
entire
liability.
that's
part
of
the
fairness
argument.
as
i
say,
the
other
part
is
a
desire
to
harmonize
the
securities
laws
and
give
these
defendants
the
right
to
contribution
that
congress
gave
them
in
the
comparable
express
causes
of
action.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
to
the...
well,
of
course,
that
would...
it's
possible
for
the
plaintiff,
the
victim,
not
to
name
all
the
possible
defendants.
that's
why
contribution
may
be
a
cause
of
action.
it
can
result
in
some
cases
in
an
additional
action.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
the
plaintiff
would
have
the
power
to--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--oh--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
the
plaintiff
may
be
quite
confident,
or
reasonably
confident
on
getting
a
full
recovery,
because
it
is
joint
and
several
liability,
and
if
the
plaintiff
knows
it's
got
a
deep
pocket--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
most
plaintiffs
would
not
want
to
have
contribution.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
absence
of
contribution
i
think
gives
plaintiffs
additional
control
over
the
lawsuit,
i
think
is
the
short
answer
to
that.
let
me
say,
then,
just
a
word
about
the
second
point
i
have,
why
the
commission
believes
that
the
comparable
provisions
in
the
securities
laws
evince
a
congressional
intent
to
allow
contribution
in
private
actions
for
damages
for
securities
fraud.
in
lampf,
the
court
identified
the
express
rights
of
action
that
are
most
analogous
to
the
implied
right
of
action
under
section
10(b).
they
are
found
in
sections
9
and
18
of
the
1934
act.
sections
9
and
18
target
the
precise
dangers
that
are
the
focus
of
section
10(b),
and
they
provide
remedies
for
investors
injured
by
manipulative
practices
or
false
or
misleading
statements,
and
of
course
both
sections
9
and
18
expressly
provide
for
contributions...
contribution
rights.
section
10(b)
is
the
catch-all
provision.
it
overlaps
both
sections
9
and
18.
it
provides
a
general
remedy
for
manipulative
or
deceptive
practices.
because
sections
9,
10(b),
and
18
are
integral
elements
of
a
complex
web
of
regulations,
as
the
court
said
in
lampf,
they
should
be
construed
to
form
a
coherent
whole.
consequently,
congress'
express
determination
to
allow
contribution
under
sections
9
and
18
should
also
govern
under
section
10(b).
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
