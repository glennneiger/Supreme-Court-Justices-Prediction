were
there
pendant
state

claims
in
this
case?
justice
anthony

does
state
law
allow
a
contribution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
maybe--
--are
those
acts...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
are
those
actions
exclusive?
do
you
have
to
elect
between--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
can't
you
just
plead
them
all
and
ask
for
contribution
as
to
the
former
but
not
as
to

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
may
be
true.
my
only
point
was
that's
not
necessarily
a
repealer
of
the

m.
kennedy

he
elects.
