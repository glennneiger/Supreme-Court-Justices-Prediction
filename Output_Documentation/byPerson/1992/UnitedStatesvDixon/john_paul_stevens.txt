justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
to
carry
your
response
to
justice
souter
one
step
further?
why
is
this
different
from
the
felony
murder
case,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
like
the
contempt,
which
incorporates
all
the
different
kinds
of
criminal
conduct
that
could
be
prohibited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
the
difference.
that's
what
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
i
understand,
but
supposing
the
felony
murder
that
says
that
the
crime
can
be
committed
if
you
kill
someone
in
the
course
of
rape,
robbery,
burglary--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ten
different
felonies--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
is
that
different
than
contempt,
that
would
be
naming
one
of
several
alternative
violations
of
law
to
carry
it
out--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
under...
just
in
a
blockburger
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
when
you
have
court
orders
that
do,
why
don't
they
meet
the
blockburger
standard
everybody
talks
about
here?
it
seems
to
me
blockburger
is...
the
same
suggestion
i
guess
justice
souter
was
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
a
violation
of
the
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
the
same
in
the
felony
murder.
it's
the...
it's
a
killing,
and
it's
also
committing
one
of
alternative
offenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
so
does
the
contempt
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
also
would
be
an
independent
violation
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
be
an
independent
violation
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
let
me
just
be
sure
about...
of
course,
your
theory
applies
even
if
they've
taken...
asked
for
a
contempt
punishment
of
a
couple
of
years.
your
theory
would
still
be
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
theory
would
also
be
the
same
if
in
the
first
proceeding
the
defendant
were
acquitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
not
subject
to
a
contempt
power,
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
am
i
incorrect
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
bail
reform
act
there's
a
contempt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
i'm
talking
about
the
congressional
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
there
been
any
cases
from
this
court
between
debs
and
chapman
and
grady
that
support
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
a
gap
of
what,
100
years,
is
it,
or
90
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
clear
that
the
law
of
contempt
has
changed
rather
dramatically
since
1897.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
requiring
jury
trial
and
so
forth,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
judge
could
immediately
haul
the
assaultive
spouse
before
the
court
and
charge
him
with
criminal
contempt
and
hold
him
without
bail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson
was
correct.
he
missed
it
by
just
one
section.
it's
3148
of
the
bail
reform
act.
it
does
provide
for
criminal
contempt
as
one
of
the
sanctions
for
violating
a
bail
order,
which
it
seems
to
me
gives
some
added
focus
to
the
discussion
that
we've
been
having.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
to
the
extent
that
you're
concerned
that
you
need
to
make
the
contempt
proceedings
officially
serious,
is
there
any
limit
on
the
court's
power
to
impose
the
same
punishment
they
would
impose
they
would
impose
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
can
be
more
than
one
6
months
consecutively,
can't
it
be?
