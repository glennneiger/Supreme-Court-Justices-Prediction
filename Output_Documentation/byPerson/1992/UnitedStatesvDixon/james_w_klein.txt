mr.
james
w.
klein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
wants
to
prosecute
mr.
dixon
and
mr.
foster
for
breaking
the
law
after
they
have
already
been
prosecuted
for
breaking
these
same
laws
in
violation
of
court
orders.
i
have
three
points
to
cover
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
these
circumstances.
first,
if
we
could
set
aside
just
for
a
moment
the
special
features
of
contempt,
i
think
it
would
be
clear
that
further
prosecution
here
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause
under
pre-grady
principles,
and
we
think
that
the
controlling
principles
are
those
in
harris
and
actually
with
respect
to
dixon
the
principles
of
brown
v.
ohio.
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
offenses
now
being
prosecuted
were
component
offenses
or
elements
of
the
offenses
that
were
prosecuted
first,
so
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
talk
about
conduct
at
all.
we
think
a
facial
examination
of
the
applicable
laws
takes
this
court
to
the
principles
of
harris
or
brown.
my
second
point
would
be
that
there
should
be
no
change
in
the
court's
general
rule
that
a
comprehensive
offense
and
a
component
offense
are
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
simply--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
i
think,
actually,
with
respect
to
dixon,
where
the
court's
order
was...
i'm
sorry,
with
respect
to
foster,
where
the
order
was
do
not
commit
an
assault
and
do
not
commit
a
threat
as
defined
by
the
district
of
columbia
criminal
code,
that
yes,
these
are
like...
these
meet
brown
and
therefore
blockburger.
they
are
tradition,
included
offenses.
with...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
w.
klein
well,
i
do...
i
think
that
they
fail
the
blockburger...
i
always
get
confused
which
is
meeting
and
which
is--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--that's
right.
i
think
that
one
of
these
cases,
foster,
could
be
decided
under
the
principles
of
brown,
that
the
crimes
now
being
prosecuted
constitute
elements
of
the
crimes
previously
prosecuted,
and
in
dixon,
where
the
court's
order
was,
it
is
a
crime
to
commit
any
crime,
that
that
is
comparable
to
the
relationship
of
the
two
laws
in
harris
v.
oklahoma
which
was
the
felony
murder
statute.
and
i
think
that
the
comparison...
and
this
is
really
very
important,
and
i
think
this
is
why
grady
really
isn't
needed
to
decide
the
relationship
in
this
case,
is
that
we
can
make
that
comparison
between
the
definition
of
the
offenses
being
prosecuted
simply
by
a
facial
examination
of
the
laws,
one
a
judge-made
law,
of
course,
that
being
the
contempt,
and
the
other
a
statutory
law,
but
we
don't
have
to
ask
about
conduct
or
what
the
prosecutor's
theory
of
the
case
was.
mr.
james
w.
klein
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
because
the
standard
procedure--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--the
standard
procedure
there
would
be
to
utilize
could
be
to
revoke
the
probation
and
to
put
the
person
incarcerate
the
person.
that
would
not
be--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
the
revocation
of
probation
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding
the
way
a
prosecution
for
criminal
contempt
is.
mr.
james
w.
klein
because
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
young
v....
excuse
me,
in
the
providence
journal
case,
and
in
the
young
case,
that
a
criminal
contempt
prosecution,
regardless
of
who
actually
handles
the
prosecution,
is
a
criminal
prosecution
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign.
and
in
fact
we
think
that...
and
that
was
said
twice,
and
in
fact
that
goes
back
to
gompers,
50
or
60
years
before,
that
a
criminal
contempt
prosecution
is
between
the
public
and
the
defendant
and
it
is
not
part
of
the
underlying
civil
proceeding,
which
is
what
there
was
in
foster,
and
that
it
is
a...
that
the
criminal
contempt
is
a
crime
in
the
ordinary
sense,
regardless
of
who
prosecutes
it,
and
we
think
that
the
answer,
your
honor,
to--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
no
one
has
doubted
in
this
litigation
to
this
point,
and
i
didn't
hear
the
government
doubt
it
this
morning,
that
that
was
in
fact
a
criminal
prosecution,
a
criminal
contempt
prosecution.
the
judge
at
mr.
foster's
trial
said
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
he
said
that
the
government...
excuse
me,
he
said
that
the
attorney
there,
who
was
representing
the
government,
would
have
to
prove
the
contempt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
was
a
determinate
sentence,
which
is
as
i
read
this
court's
jurisprudence
always
of
tremendous
importance
in
deciding
whether
the
proceeding
is
remedial
and
civil
or
punitive
and...
not
punitive,
but
criminal,
because
the
sentence
is
to
punish
for
the
affront
to
the
court's
dignity.
and
i
think
that
that's
really
the
critical
point
here,
which
is
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
criminal
contempt
is
to
vindicate
the
authority
of
the
court
and
not
to
protect
private
litigants,
and...
for
the
litigants,
including
victims,
have
other
recourse.
mr.
james
w.
klein
i
assume
that's
true.
i
think
that
distinction
obviously
exists,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
distinction
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
double
jeopardy
question
in
this
case,
because
in
each
of
these
cases,
and
as
the
cases
come
before
the
court
now,
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
for
whatever
reason,
the
courts
decided
to
go
ahead
with
contempt.
those
judgments
are...
they're
final,
they're
presumably
legitimate,
and
both
dixon
and
foster
have
stood
trial
and
faced
the
government
on--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
i
think
that
one
might
be
able
to
say
that
if
we
were
back
at
the
earlier
stage
and
asking
the
question
whether
the
court
should
go
ahead
and
punish
for
contempt,
there
would
arguably
be
greater
necessity
in
the
one
in
foster
than
in
the
other,
but
in
terms
of
whether
foster
and
dixon
have
a
right
to
claim
double
jeopardy
at
this
point,
i
think
that
the
cases
are
entirely
the
same.
mr.
james
w.
klein
well,
i
think
i
would
lose
this
case
a
hundred
years
ago.
i
obviously
don't
think
i
should
lose
it
today.
ever
since
the
court
decided
debs,
it
has
been
asking
itself
why
should
the
interest
that
underlies
the
contempt
power
produce
different
results?
what
does
that
amount
to?
mr.
james
w.
klein
i
think
that
debs
is
the
watershed.
it's
not
been
straight
downhill.
it's
a
bit
like
hiking
where
you
come
down,
and
then
unfortunately
you
have
to
go
back
up
more
than
you
like.
it
has
been
a
struggle,
but
the
path
from
debs
to
bloom
is
unmistakable.
it
is
the
course
of
this
court
repeatedly
asking
that
question
and
increasingly
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
contempt
should
be
treated
as
a
crime
in
the
ordinary
sense,
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
principles
underlying
that
statement.
that
is
not
a
slogan.
it's
anything
but
a
slogan.
it
is
a
hard-won
principle
that
i
think
reflects
first
the
court's
sense
that,
unless
the
contempt
power
is
tightly
tethered
to
the
bill
of
rights,
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
exercise
of
that
power
can
be
restricted
to
the
least
power
necessary.
and
there
is
a
second
component,
and
the
second
component
is
the
court's
recognition...
i
think
that
bloom
is
the
crowning
point
here...
is
the
court's
recognition
that
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
a
contempt
prosecution
on
the
individual,
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
individual
liberty
of
the
sort
that
the
bill
of
rights
is
directed
to,
that
contempt
is
in
many
ways
indistinguishable,
and
i
think
that's
especially
true
here.
mr.
james
w.
klein
i
agree,
but
i--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--because
the
rule
that
i
think
underlies
bloom,
and
which
is
really
the
result
of
the
history,
is
that
contempt
will
be
treated
as
a
crime
in
the
ordinary
sense
unless
there's
a
compelling
necessity
to
carve
out
a
special
rule
for
contempt,
and
there
is
no
necessity,
and
this
court's
decision
in
young,
your
honor--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--i
disagree.
i
think
that
the
government
greatly
misreads
young
and
the
import
of
the
decision
in
young.
young
puts
the
prosecutor
in
the
driver's
seat.
young
says,
at
least
in
the
federal
courts...
and
any
other
jurisdiction
now
has
a
model
that
it
could
follow...
young
says
these
prosecutions
must
be
referred
in
the
first
instance
to
the
public
prosecutor,
and
then
the
prosecutor
can
control
the
timing
of
when
the
contempt
prosecution
is
brought.
the
prosecutor
should
do
what
prosecutors
normally
do
before
they
bring
a
case.
they
should
see
what
other
offenses
would
be
jeopardy-barred
if
not
brought
at
the
same
time.
mr.
james
w.
klein
the
prosecutor
has
a
choice.
if
the
prosecutor
is
concerned
about
the
double
jeopardy
implications,
the
prosecutor
simply
says,
yes,
i
will
accept
responsibility
for
the
contempt
prosecution
and
i'm
going
to
bring
it,
judge,
when
i'm
ready
to
bring
the
prosecution
on
the
substantive
charge
and
the
government
elects
not
to
bring
the
contempt
prosecution,
that's
not
the
government
being
preempted,
that's
the
government
making
a
decision
to
share
prosecutorial
power.
mr.
james
w.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
james
w.
klein
well,
it's
not--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
it's
novel
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
not--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--yes,
and
we
cite
at
least
one
case--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--we
cite
at
least
one
case
where
the
government
brought
an
indictment
charging
criminal
contempt
and
there's
no
problem
with
adding
a
count
in
an
information
or
an
indictment
alleging
contempt.
mr.
james
w.
klein
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
i
make
clear,
we
are
not
challenging
the
power
of
the
court
to
impose
separate
punishments
in
these
cases.
mr.
james
w.
klein
if
the
court
allowed
the--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
klein
yes,
it
would
work
both
ways.
mr.
james
w.
klein
that's
right.
there
has
to
be
a
cooperative
venture,
but
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
surprising
development
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
say,
as
i
think
the
court's
jurisprudence
is
leading
it
to
say,
that
contempt
is
a
crime
in
the
ordinary
sense
for
these
purposes
and
that
these
cases...
that
one
is
simply
a
component
part
of
the
other.
mr.
james
w.
klein
the
question
was...
no,
no.
the
question
was
just,
is
it
possible,
and
is
there
any
support
for
the
authority...
excuse
me,
any
support
for
the
proposition
that
a
contempt
prosecution
can
be
brought
at
the
same
time
as
another
offense,
and
my
answer
is
yes,
that
there's
nothing
unusual
about
it.
what's
the
hardship?
mr.
james
w.
klein
well,
it's...
well,
i...
that's
right,
but
that's
because
no
one
has
contested
it
as
a
possibility.
i
mean,
the
government--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
this
doesn't
arise
very
much,
your
honor.
these
cases
are
really
sort
of
oddball
cases.
the
whole
issue
has
arisen
only
twice
that
we
know
of
in
federal
court
in
the
last
65
years,
and
both
times
the
courts
came
out
in
our
favor.
so
there
is
apparently
no
federal
practice,
no
entrenched
practice
of
having
two
prosecutions,
because
the
only
district
courts
that
have
looked
at
it
in
65
years
have
said,
you
can't
do
that.
if
you
want
to
bring
them,
bring
them
together.
so
it's
not
a
state...
it's
not
a
federal
practice,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
klein
that's
true.
the
court
could
not
achieve
immediacy,
but
i
think
this
court
has
already
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
a
contempt
does
not
occur
in
the
courtroom,
then
immediacy
is
not
an
essential
part
of
the
court's
ability--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
it's
true
of...
that's
true
of
crime
generally.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
somebody's
charged
with
a
homicide--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--right,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
courts
should
in
these
instances
put
pressure
on
the
government
to
bring
any
substantive
criminal
prosecution
swiftly,
and
the
question
is,
does
the
court's
interest
have
to
be
vindicated
so
much
more
quickly
than
the
general
public
interest?
mr.
james
w.
klein
well,
i
think
that's
putting
a
lot
of
weight
on
the
purpose
of
criminal
contempt,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--well,
the
orders
themselves
can't
be
enforced
except
by
criminal
contempt--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--and
i
agree...
the
orders
themselves.
but
the
victims
of
domestic
violence
can
be
protected
through
many
other
mechanisms
that
don't
require
the
court
either
to
recast
and
expand
the
purposes
of
criminal
contempt
or
require
the
bending
of
the
double
jeopardy
rules.
number
1,
the
prosecutors
should
make
domestic
violence
a
priority.
mr.
james
w.
klein
they
do,
and
the
question,
your
honor,
is
why
do
they--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--that's
true,
but
i
want
to
make
the
point
that--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--i
understand,
your
honor,
and
that
was
my
point
about
a
homicide.
when
someone
is
charged
with
a
homicide,
the
public
is
threatened
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial
and
the
government
can't
come
in
and
quickly
prosecute
the
person
for
the
underlying
assault--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
in
fact...
it
may
sound
surprising,
coming
from
a
public
defender...
that
preventive
detention
has
to
be
an
answer
in
these
cases.
it
is
the
traditional...
somewhat
traditional
noncriminal
means
of
preventing
future
harm
during
the
pendency
of
a
trial,
and
i--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
fact
preventive
detention
is
actually
particularly
appropriate
when
you're
talking
about
a
class
of
people
who
have
already
broken
a
court
order.
mr.
james
w.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
klein
that's
right,
and
serious
criminal
contempt,
and
not
only
that,
your
honor,
but
many
jurisdictions
are
making
it
a
crime
to
violate
a
domestic
violence
order.
i
think
we
put
in
our
brief,
some
38
states
have
done
that,
and
that
is
a
serious
crime.
the
other
part
of
the
answer
i
was
trying
to...
i
was
giving
justice
souter
was
that
the
government
should
speed
up
the
prosecution
of
domestic
violence.
in
the
dixon
case,
which
was
a
drug
case,
they
returned
an
indictment
in
6
days,
and
in
the
foster
case--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--but
in--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
klein
i
agree,
the
question
referred
to
that
as
the
rhetoric
of
the
court's
decision,
and
if
there
was
a
concern
there,
i
wanted
to
deal
with
it.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
you
were
given
some
inadvertently
slightly
wrong
information
in
response
to
one
of
your
questions.
in
the
dixon
case,
the
prosecutor
moved
to
modify
dixon's
pretrial
release,
and
he
cited
in
his
motion
the
indictment,
and
he
came
before
the
court
and
they
started
the
proceeding.
at
some
point
the
judge
said,
i
don't
think
that
i
would
have
a
basis
to
modify
his
bail
if
my
concern
is
flight,
and
then
the
judge
said
to
the
prosecutor...
and
this
is
critical
to
the
facts...
are
you
seeking
preventive
detention,
and
the
relevant
provision
is
in
our
brief.
it's
d.c.
code
section
23-1329(c).
that
would
have
allowed
for
the
preventive
detention
of
dixon
on
the
showing
that
he
had
violated
a
condition
of
his
release.
there
would
have
been
a
lesser
showing
than
was
needed
to
prove
the
contempt.
one
was
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
the
violation.
the
prosecutor
said,
no,
i
don't
want
to
seek
preventive
detention,
and
it
was--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--i
think
under
the
provision
we're
talking
about...
i
could
be
wrong.
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
time
limit
with
respect
to
this
particular
preventive
detention
component.
mr.
james
w.
klein
but
your
honor,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
problem
here
anyway,
because
the
government
already
had
the
indictment
in
hand,
so
in
terms
of
joining
everything
together,
the
prosecutor
could
simply
have
said,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
i
want
to
go
ahead
with
a
criminal
contempt
prosecution,
but
if
that's
what
we're
going
to
do,
let's
proceed
on
the
indictment,
and
they
could
have
done
it
all
together.
i
agree
that
foster
looks
somewhat
different.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
system,
if
the
states
are
going
to
have
a
system
of
private
prosecution,
then
it's
going
to
be
harder
for
them
to
comply
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
but
this
court
set
up
a
system
in
young.
this
court
said,
the
cases
should
be
referred
to
the
public
prosecutor,
and
then
in
young,
what
we
have
was
a
full-scale
policy
decision
by
the
united
states
attorney's
office
for
the
district
of
columbia
not
to
treat
contempts
arising
out
of
civil
protection
order
violations
as
if
they
were
criminal,
and
this
court
said
in
young,
they're
not
part
of
the
civil
proceeding,
they
are
criminal.
if
the
u.s.
attorney
or
any
prosecutor
is
going
to
squander
the
power
that
young
says
the
prosecutor
should
have,
then
i
don't
think
it's
legitimate
for
the
prosecutor
to
be
able
to
come
back
later
and
say
that
we
were
preempted.
that's
just
bad
prosecutorial
policy,
and
that's
what
happened
in
both
of
these
cases,
and
that's
why
these
cases
i
think
are
something
of
an
oddball.
these
were
not
cases
of
the
court's
insisting
on
vindicating
its
authority
right
now.
the
record
in
foster
in
particular
shows
the
judge
saying,
can
you
reach
a
settlement,
have
you
talked
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
about
it?
i
don't
really
care
about
any
of
that.
so
we
didn't
have
the
court's
viewing
the
vindication
of
their
authority
as
requiring
immediate
action.
i
think
that
when
we
pull
back
from
this
case
for
a
moment
the
government
is
saying,
it's
easy,
just
treat
contempt
as
different,
but
i
think
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
do
something
quite
extraordinary.
mr.
james
w.
klein
just...
that's
true.
there's
always
been,
at
least
in
the
past
couple
of
federal
statutes,
a
provision
for
contempt,
and
there
is
no
tradition...
i'm
fairly
certain
of
this,
justice
kennedy...
no
tradition
at
all
of
using
contempt
to
violate
for
new
crimes
committed
while
on
release.
in
fact--
mr.
james
w.
klein
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
