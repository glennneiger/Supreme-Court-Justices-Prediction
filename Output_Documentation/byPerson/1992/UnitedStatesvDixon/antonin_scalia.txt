justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
the
mischief
is
letting
judges
issue
orders
prohibiting
the
commission
of
crimes.
i
mean,
maybe
they
shouldn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
law
against
it
anyway.
the
fellow
knows
he's
going
to
go
up
the
river
for
a
number
of
years.
why
do
you
have
to
lay
on
top
of
that
a
judicial
order
telling
him,
don't
commit
a
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
that
was
a
bad
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
klein,
what
you
say
makes
sense
to
me
but
for
the
long
tradition
of
the
country.
how
do
you
explain
that
tradition?
what...
i
mean,
it's
just
a
novel
proposition,
that
you
can't
do
what
was
done
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
debs
is
the
watershed,
you
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you're
right
that
contempt
was
considered
something
quite
separate
from
criminal
prosecution
originally
and
that
it's
changed
with
debs,
but
the
question
is,
shall
it
be
considered
the
same
as
a
criminal
prosecution
for
all
purposes?
we
faced
that
question
a
few
years
ago
and
decided,
for
example,
that
the
court
can
appoint
its
own
prosecutor
for
contempt,
thus
raising
the
problem
that
the
government
poses
in
this
case...
the
prosecutor
doesn't
even
have
to
know
that
a
contempt
proceeding
is
going
on.
so
we
are
inevitably
confronted
with
the
question,
having
decided
that
contrary
to
what
the
common
law
tradition
had
been
we're
going
to
treat
contempt
as
a
criminal
matter,
are
we
going
to
treat
is
a
criminal
matter
for
all
purposes?
now,
we
certainly
haven't
treated
it
as
a
criminal
matter
for
purposes
of
whether
the
court
can
appoint
the
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
make
an
exception
for
double
jeopardy
as
well,
or
else
maybe--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
necessity
is
that
the
court
can
be
imposing
a
slap
on
the
wrist
for
contempt
and
depriving
the
prosecutor
of
the
ability
on
behalf
of
the
people
to
put
the
person
away
for
a
much
longer
term.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean,
what
happens
sometimes
is
the
court
wants
to
vindicate
its
dignity
and
the
prosecutor
says,
i'm
not
as
interested
in
vindicating
your
dignity
as
i
am
in
putting
this
person
away.
i
do
not
want
to
prosecute
for
the
contempt.
if
there's
going
to
be
this
double
jeopardy
consequence,
i
choose
not
to.
what
does
the
court
do
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
somebody
who's
subjected
to
domestic
violence
who
is
not
fortunate
enough
to
be
engaged
in
the
process
of
a
lawsuit
at
the
time
has
to
wait
for
the
wheels
of
the
normal
criminal
process
to
grind
away,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
consider
it
okay
in
that
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you,
mr.
klein.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
for
litigants,
however,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
small
part
of
the
whole
problem,
if
that
is
a
major
problem.
you're
really
just
talking
about
vindication
of
the
court.
that's
the
only
thing
that's
special.
outside
of
that,
you
have
people
who
are
being
subjected
to
violence.
it's
just
as
bad
whether
you're
engaged
in
litigation
at
the
time
or
whether
you're
not
engaged
in
litigation
at
the
time.
if
it
takes
2
years
to
prosecute
it,
that's
terrible
for
both
categories
of
people,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
distinctive
characteristic
is
the
dignity
of
the
court
somehow.
