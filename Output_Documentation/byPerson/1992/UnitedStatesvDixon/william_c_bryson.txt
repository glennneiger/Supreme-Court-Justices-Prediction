mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
successive
prosecutions
for
contempt
of
court
and
substantive
criminal
offenses
which
are
based
on
the
same
underlying
conduct.
our
position
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
such
successive
prosecutions
because
crimes
such
as
assault
with
intent
to
kill
or
drug
trafficking
are
not
the
same
offense
as
contempt
of
court.
now,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly
are
as
follows.
respondents
were
both
proceeded
against
under
contempt
of
court
proceedings
for
violating
court
orders
that
prohibited
them
from
engaging
in
certain
criminal
acts.
respondent
dixon
was
barred
by
an
order
that
was
part
of
a
pretrial
release
condition
that
provided
that
he
should
not
commit
any
crimes,
and
respondent
foster
was
found
to
have
violated
a
civil
protection
order
which
provided
that
he
must
not
assault,
molest,
or
threaten
his
wife.
after
they
were
both
found
in
contempt
for
violating
those
orders,
they
were
prosecuted
criminally
for,
in
foster's
case,
assault
with
intent
to
kill,
and
other
assaults,
and
in
dixon's
case
for
the
drug
trafficking
offense
that
formed
the
basis
for
his
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
in
these
particular
cases,
no,
the
prosecutor
would
not
prove
any
additional
facts.
the
conduct
is
the
same.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
literally
it
probably
does
fall
within
the
language
of
the
formulation
that
the
court
adopted
in
grady.
now,
i
hasten
to
add...
this
is
a
major
part
of
our
submission
here...
that
that
formulation
the
court
has
already
said
in
felix
was
unduly
broad
and
the
court
noted
in
felix
that
that
formulation
should
not
be
followed
to
the
limits
of
its
language.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor,
and
let
me
move
directly
to
menna
and
colombo,
because
the
respondents
discuss
menna
and
colombo
in
some
detail--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
i
think
they
are
easily
distinguishable.
both
of
those
cases
involved
a
new
york...
a
sort
of
double
header
new
york
contempt
statute.
there
was...
and
if
i
can
go
into
the
details
of
those
statutes,
it's
important.
one
of
them
was
section
750
of
the
judiciary
law
of
new
york,
which
was
contempt,
and
provided
that
a
court
could
hold
somebody
in
contempt
for
a
variety
of
acts,
including
refusal
to
comply
with
an
order
to
testify.
there
was
another
provision
of
new
york
law,
section
600
of
the
penal
law
that
was
in
effect
in
those
days,
which
had
almost
exactly
the
same
language,
also
entitled
contempt,
and
provided
that
courts
could
penalize
people
for
various
things,
including
failure
to
testify
in
response
to
a
direct
order
of
the
court.
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
suggestion...
and
the
court
in
this
case
did
not...
in...
excuse
me,
in
colombo
and
menna
did
not
reach
the
underlying
double
jeopardy
questions,
but
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
suggestion
that
there
was
merit
to
the
underlying
double
jeopardy
claims,
it
was
simply
saying
that
you
can't
prosecute
somebody
for
contempt
and
then
come
back
and
say
well,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you
for
contempt
again,
when
the
two
contempt
proceedings
have
exactly
the
same
elements.
that
case
did
not
at
all
involve
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
where
we
have
a
contempt
proceeding
which
has
elements
a
and
b,
and
we
have
criminal
acts
which
are
not
part
of
contempt
which
have
elements
d,
e,
and
f.
the
elements
simply
do
not
overlap
in
this
setting
and
that,
in
our
view,
makes
all
the
difference.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
because
we
don't
think
that
the
offense
in
the
sense
that
that
term
is
used
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
a
violation
of
this
particular
court
order.
the
offense
is
contempt
of
court.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
analogy--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
government
certainly,
or
the
court,
if
the
court
is
proceeding
in
the
contempt
proceeding,
has
to
prove
that
in
fact
that
court
order
was
violated,
but
it
is
no
different,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it's
all
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
let
me
give
you
an
analogy
that
i
think
applies
here.
suppose
the
crime
in
question
is
failure
to
follow
a
lawful
order
of
a
police
officer.
that
would
not
incorporate,
in
effect,
all
possible
human
activity
that
could
be
subject
to
a
police
officer's
order
as
being
elements
of
that
crime.
the
crime
is
failing
to
follow
an
order
of
a
police
officer,
and
if
the
order
of
a
police
officer
is
don't
shoot
that
man,
it
doesn't
make
murder
a
lesser
included
offense,
in
effect,
of
the
offense
of
failing
to
follow
a
lawful
order
of
a
police
officer.
it's
the
same
situation
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
souter.
the
offense
of
criminal
contempt
does
have
elements
which
is
violation
of
a
court
order.
now,
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right,
but
in
a
false
statement
offense
you
have
to
have
a
false
statement.
the
offense
is
making
a
false
statement,
let's
say
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency.
the
government
has
to
actually
prove
what
the
statement
was
and
then
show
that
it
was
false.
that's
no
different,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is...
when
you
go...
when
you
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense,
which
is
what's
critical
here,
the
fact
that
there
is
conduct,
and
really
the
conduct
here
is
the
violation
of
the
particular
order,
it's...
the
facts
of
the
case
are...
excuse
me...
are
the
order
of
the
court
and
the
fact
of
the
violation
of
that
particular
order,
that
doesn't
count
in
the
way
blockburger
looks
at
the
separate
elements
of
an
offense--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--as
an
element
of
a
crime.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
clear
that
when
you
talk
about
the
elements
of
contempt
you're
not
talking
about
the
details
of
the
particular
order
and
the
particular
violation
of
the
order
that's
at
issue
in
the
particular
case,
because
otherwise
you
really
are
looking
at
conduct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
you've
adopted
a
same
conduct
test--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
could,
your
honor,
yes,
that's
right.
now,
i
think
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
justice
souter
is
limiting
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
to
cases
in
which
brands
of
contempt
that
involve
the
violation
of
an
order...
in
other
words,
contempts
emerging
from
injunctions
or
other
orders--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
we're
not
claiming
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
i
think
it's
very
different,
because
in
felony
murder,
your
honor,
you
have
an
aggravated
form
of
a
lesser
offense
in
which
the
aggravating
statute
incorporates
by
specific
reference
all
the
elements
of
the
lesser--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
it's...
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
contempt
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
difference
is
that
in
harris
v.
oklahoma
sort
of
situation,
where
the
statute
says
anybody
who
commits,
let's
say,
burglary
or
robbery
and
uses
a
firearm
is
subject
to
an
aggravated
penalty.
that
is
in
the
nature
of
a
lesser
included
offense
with
a
greater
form,
the
aggravated
form--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
the
statute--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
you
had
a
contempt
statute
that
said
anybody
who
commits
the
following
five
felonies--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
does
so
in
violation
of
a
court
order,
then
i
think
you
would
have
a
close
analogy
to
harris,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
contempt
statute
in
this
case
and
contempt
statutes--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--typically
read.
they
do
not
provide...
they
do
not
incorporate
the
specific
elements
of
the
underlying
felonies,
or
the
underlying
crimes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
is
simply
the
difference,
your
honor,
between
an
offense
and
conduct
that
may
constitute
an
offense
as
we
see
it.
in
other
words,
the
conduct
in
the
case
of
contempt
is
the
violation
of
the
particular
court
order
that's
been
entered
in--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
but
the
legislature
did
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
the
greater
offense
incorporates
specifically
the
elements
of
a
lesser
offense.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
not,
your
honor.
the...
it
does
not
incorporate--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
elements
of
the
lesser
crimes.
it
simply
says
any
court
order,
whatever
it
is,
whether
it's
a
crime,
whatever
it
is,
if
you
violate
a
court
order
you've
committed
a
crime.
to
say
that
that
makes
a
lesser
included
offense
of
everything
that
a
person
could
do
that
could
possibly
be
subject
to
a
court
order,
it
seems
to
me
is
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--twist
the
notion
of
lesser
included
offenses.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
but
that
is
to
carry
the
notion
of
lesser
included
offenses,
your
honor,
we
think
to
the
point
that
it
no
longer
has
any
meaning,
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
used
it
in
grady
and
harris.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
your
honor,
there
were
several
possibilities.
first,
dixon--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--absolutely.
the
first--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
two
cases
present
different
options
for
the
prosecutor.
in
dixon,
in
a
sense
the
prosecutor
has
more
options
because
the
prosecutor
is
more
directly
in
control
of
the
situation.
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
in
dixon
went
to
the
court
and
said,
we
would
like
a
modification
of
the
terms
of
the
bail
release,
and
suggesting
an
increase
in
the
bond.
the
court
said
no,
i
think
this
is
serious
enough
that
it
is
deserving
of
contempt
proceeding.
the
court
could
also
have
simply
revoked
the
release
of
dixon
on
the
murder
charge
which
he
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
the
problem
in
this
setting,
is
that
the
court
is
in
a
position
that
it
can
deprive
the
prosecutor
of
proceeding
with
the
criminal
case.
now,
that
problem
is
even
more
serious
in
the
foster-type
setting,
because
you've
got
two
very
important
interests
at
stake.
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
the
interest
of
the
woman,
typically,
in...
who
has
the
civil
protection
order
and
who's
being
assaulted
by
her
husband.
she
wants
immediate
relief
and
is
entitled
to
immediate
relief...
going
into
court,
asking
for
a
contempt
adjudication
which
may
be
the
only
way
that
she
can
get
the
assaultive
behavior
to
stop.
everything
else
has
been
tried.
they've
gotten
a
civil
protection
order.
it
doesn't
work.
she
needs
quick,
effective
relief,
so
she
goes
in
for
contempt,
and
that's
a
very
sympathetic
situation
in
which
to
grant
contempt.
but
it
may
well
be
that
the
prosecutor
is
not
in
a
position
at
that
point
to
go
forward
with
criminal
charges,
or
it
may
well
be
that
the
prosecutor
doesn't
even
have
notice
that
she's
proceeding
on
the
contempt
angle
and
therefore
if
dixon
and
foster
is
correct...
the
decision
below
in
dixon
and
foster
is
correct,
the
prosecutor
will
be
foreclosed
from
bringing
very
serious
criminal
charges
in
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
is
subject
to
no
more
than
6
months
imprisonment
under
the
family
court
contempt
proceedings
that
are
at
issue
here.
now,
of
course,
there's
another
general
contempt
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
not
invoked
here
which
provides
for
longer
contempt
incarceration,
but
6
months
is
the
limit
that
someone
in
foster's
position
was
exposed
to,
even
though
the
conduct
he
engaged
in
was
much
more
serious
than
a
6-month
sentence
would
suggest.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
now,
that...
let
me
turn
to
why
it
is
that
we
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that
would
depend
on
the
resolution
of
the
collateral
estoppel
claim.
of
course,
he
would,
as
he
did
below,
claim
with
respect
to
some
of
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--there
is
an
issue.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
now,
we...
that
isn't
before
the
court
and
how
that
is
resolved
is...
of
course
depends
in
part
on
how
the
court
addresses
this
question,
but
that
would
be
an
argument
that
he
no
doubt
would
make
in
that
setting.
but
there's
an
even
greater
danger,
let
me
point
out,
of
an
acquittal
in
the
following
setting.
suppose
what
you've
got
is
a
foster-type
situation
in
which
the
contempt
proceeds
first,
and
the
basis
for
the
contempt
is
an
attempted
murder
by
foster
against
his
wife,
and
the
judge
acquits
foster
not
on
the
ground
that
the
murder
didn't
take
place
or
that
foster
didn't
commit
the
murder,
but
on
the
ground
that
foster
didn't
have
notice
of
the
order.
in
that
situation,
if
this...
if
the
lower
court
decision
is
right
in
this
case,
and
these
are
the
same
offense,
then
we
would
not
be
able
to
proceed
with
the
attempted
murder
charge
in
the
criminal
case
because
the
offense
would
already
have
been
prosecuted,
even
though--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--even
if
the
prosecutor
never
knew
about
the
contempts.
that
is
the
ultimate
horrible
case,
and
that
case
doesn't
come
up
very
often
and
it's
not
presented
here,
but
i
think
that
is
the
implication.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
but
if
you
have
one--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
double
jeopardy
clause
says
you
can't
prosecute
twice
for
the
same
offense.
once
you
cross
the
river
and
say
the
contempt
is
the
same
offense--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
no,
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
a
much
broader
problem,
which
is
once
you
say
that
it
is
the
same
offense,
then
unless
this
court
simply
changes
the
double
jeopardy
rule
with
respect
to
same
offenses,
the
implication
surely
is
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
proceeded
against
under
the
quote,
lesser
offense
of
attempted
murder.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
the
mischief
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
congress
has
required
it
in
the
case
of
the
bail
reform
act,
that
one
of
the
provisions
that
has
to
go
into
these
bail
orders
is,
don't
commit
any
crimes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
maybe
it
is
a
bad
idea.
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
certainly
under
the
d.c.
act.
i
believe--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i'm
not
certain,
your
honor,
whether
it's...
also
there's
a
specific
contempt
provision
in
the
bail
reform
act,
but
i
believe
so.
i
believe
in...
section
3147
i
believe
has
a
contempt,
but
i
can't
tell
you
for
sure
on
that
because
i
just
don't
recall.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
i
think
the
general
rule
is
true,
and
that's
why
it's
important
to
confine
this
notion
of
greater
and
lesser
offenses
to
situations
in
which--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--they
really
are
greater
and
lesser
offenses,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
was
going
to
discuss
it
briefly.
i
think
it
is
important
to
lay
the
historical
background
for
this
rule
and
to
note
how
well-founded
this
rule
is
in
both
this
court's
cases
and
in
the
common
law,
and
i
will
just
say
that
the
debs
case
and
in
particular
the
chapman
case
from
this
court
makes
quite
clear
that
this
court
regards...
at
least
up
until
grady
v.
corbin
has
always
regarded
contempt
and
the
substantive
offense
as
being
separate
offenses,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
common
law
approach
to
the
problem.
it's
quite
clear
under
common
law
the
contempt
was
regarded
as
a
separate
offense
from
substantive
crimes
that
were
based
on
the
same
conduct,
and
that
has
been
the
position
of
every
court
of
appeals
and
every
state
supreme
court
up
until
grady
v.
corbin.
this
is
a
well...
established
principle
of
double
jeopardy
law.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
no,
i
think
that
chapman
was
the
earlier
part
of
this
century,
but
it's
certainly
been
50-plus
years,
that's
right.
the
issue
did
not
come
up.
i
think
there
is
a
reason
that
the
issue
did
not
come
up,
which
was
because
as
all
of
the
lower
court
cases
were
saying,
were
accepting
the
proposition
that
this
was
settled
law.
it
became
unsettled
only
because
of
grady
v.
corbin.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the
procedural--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--part
of
the
law
of
contempt,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
not
the
substantive
law
of
contempt,
your
honor.
it
always
was
understood
contempt
had
the
same
elements
that
it
does
now,
and
it
was
a
crime.
there's
no
question
that
it's
always
been...
criminal
contempt
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
crime,
so
the
substantive
status
of
contempt
was
always
the
same.
it
has...
additional
procedures
have
attached
to
contempt
such
as
jury
trial,
but
the
substance
of
the
offense
has
been
the
same,
and
therefore
presumably
the
analysis
of
whether
it's
the
same
offense
as
a
substantive
crime
would
have
stayed
the
same.
now,
the
court
in
grady
changed
all
this,
at
least
as
perceived
by
the
lower
courts,
with
the
formulation
that
the
court
adopted
in
grady,
which
was
the
formulation
that
this
court
talked
about
in
felix,
that
to
establish
an
essential
element
of
an
offense
charged
in
the
second
prosecution,
the
state
will
prove
conduct
that
constitutes
an
offense
for
which
the
defendant
has
already
been
prosecuted.
now,
read
broadly,
that
formula
we
concede
would
appear
to
cover
this
case,
but
that
is
an
extremely
broad
formulation
which
has
proved
very
difficult
to
apply.
we
have
urged
the
court
and
do
continue
to
urge
the
court
either
to
limit
that
formulation
by
limiting
grady
to
its
context,
or
overruling
grady.
now,
the
court
has
already
done
the
first
in
felix.
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
the
formulation
in
grady
cannot
be
applied
broadly,
cannot
be
applied
outside
of
the
context
of
grady,
that...
the
court
said
that
taken
out
of
context
and
read
literally
the
language
from
the
formulation
supports
the
defense
of
double
jeopardy,
but
we
decline
to
read
the
language
so
expansively
because
of
the
context
in
which
grady
arose
and
because
of
difficulties
that
have
already
arisen
in
its
interpretation.
the
context
of
grady
was
a
lesser-included
offense
context,
or,
as
the
court
expressed
it,
if
not
technically
a
lesser-included
offense,
at
least
a
species
of
lesser-included
offense.
in
grady
and
in
vitale
before
it,
the
reckless
driving
by
or
traffic
infractions
that
were
the
first
prosecuted
provided
a
basis
on
which
you
could
infer
at
least
either
the
establishment
of
recklessness,
the
element
of
the
greater
offense,
or
at
least
go
a
long
way
to
establishing
that.
as
we've
argued
here,
it's
very
different
in
contempt,
because
without
knowing
a
fact
of
the
case,
the
fact
of
what's
in
the
court
order,
the
violation...
a
violation
such
as
assault
with
intent
to
kill
or
drug
trafficking
does
not
tend
to
establish
any
element
of
contempt.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
very
briefly,
first,
with
respect
to
the
young
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
young
was
a
supervisory
power
case
that
applied
only
to
the
federal
courts.
this
problem
that
we're
talking
about,
particularly
the
foster
case,
which
i
think
is
the
more
widespread
problem
that
this
legal
issue
touches
on,
is
essentially
a
state
law
question.
it
is
no
accident
that
this
arises
from
the
local
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
this
has
been
a
problem
that
has
come
up
in
the
local
state
courts
much
more
frequently
than
it
has
in
the
federal
courts,
and
in
those
courts
something
like
41
different
states
have
adopted
a
contempt
provision
as
a
means
of
enforcing
civil
protection
orders.
it
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
procedures,
and
it
isn't
something
that
can
easily
be
rolled
into
the
criminal
prosecution
process.
the
individuals
who
are
subject
to
these
civil
protection
orders
have
already
shown
themselves
not
to
be
some
people
that
are
moved
by
the
existence
of
general
criminal
liability
for
assault,
and
so
forth,
because
when
a
civil
protection
order
is
obtained,
it's
generally
on
a
showing
that
there
has
been
an
assault,
or
at
least
very
clear
threats
of
assault
already.
they
also
are
not
moved,
even
after
the
civil
protection
order,
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
civil
protection
order,
because
they
have
violated
it,
so
they
need
to
have
some
very
specific
and
strong
remedy.
that's
what
contempt
is
for,
and
that's
why
it
is
so
important
to
not
water
down
the
effect
of
contempt
in
this
setting,
and
i
would
add
one
other
point.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
contempt
can
clearly
be
charged,
but
in
many
states
preventive
detention
is
not
available
for
offenses
such
as
simple
assault,
and
in
fact
i
don't
believe--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i'm
not
sure
the
solution
to
the
current
problem
is
to
get
around
the
problem
by
creating
the
capacity
for
preventive
detention
for
minor
offenses
and
then
using
it
for
long
periods
of
time,
such
as
6
months.
i
think
that's
really
using
preventive
detention
to
serve
a
purpose
to
get
around
the
problem,
that
you
really
are
holding
him
in
contempt
but
you're
calling
it
preventive
detention
and
thereby
avoiding
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
don't
think
that's
really
a
satisfactory
result,
jurisprudentially.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
the
court
has
a
statute,
a
general
contempt
statute
that
has
no
limit
on
the
amount
of
time
that
can
be
made
the
sentence,
that's
right,
there
would
be
no
restriction.
but
typically
in
these
situations,
that's
not
the
case,
and
here
the
statute
under
which
the
proceeding
was
brought,
the
contempt
statute
in
this
particular
case,
had
a
limit
of
only
6
months
to
it...
at
least,
the
proceeding
under
the
intrafamily
act.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
for
various
acts,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
to
be
sure,
to
acknowledge
the
point
made
by
respondents,
there
is
a
separate
contempt
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
could
conceivably
have
been
invoked
but
was
not
in
this
case.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further,
thank
you.
