justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
the
premise
of
what
you're
saying
is
this,
that
criminal
contempt
does
not
have
as
its
element,
or
as
an
element,
the
commission
of
either
one
of
the
two
crimes
which
these
respective
parties
committed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
really
not
the
point.
isn't
the
point
not
whether
the
generic
offense,
if
you
will,
of
criminal
contempt
has
elements
of
other
crimes,
but
whether
the
court
order
in
this
case
has
as
its...
whether
violation
of
the
court
order
in
this
case
required
proof
of
a
crime,
and
in
fact
the
court
order
in
this
case
did
forbid
a
crime
and
its
violation
required
the
proof,
so
why
isn't
this
like
harris
v.
united
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it's
equally
true
that
there
is
no
offense
of
contempt
of
court
unless
there
is
a
court
order
and
the
offense
is
confined
to
the
elements
of
that
order,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
does,
but
may
i
just
ask
this...
and
i
realize
i
keep
interrupting
you.
i'll
stop
at
some
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
promise
you.
there
is
one
essential
respect
in
which
the
offense
of
contempt
of
court
is
different...
criminal
contempt
of
court
is
different
from
the
normal
crime,
and
that
is,
it
has
no
specific
elements.
no
one
can
be
charged
generically
with
contempt
of
court.
one
can
only
be
charged
with
contempt
for
violating
a
specific
order,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
any
contempt
analysis
has
got
to
include
the
specific
order
that
was
violated,
and
if
that
includes
the
elements
of
a
crime,
i.e.
because
it
forbids
the
commission
of
any
crime,
that
is
the
datum
that
you
look
to
to
decide
whether
you're
talking
about
a
harris
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
trouble
is
there
that
the...
at
least
as
generally
understood,
the
offense
of
failing
to
follow
the
order
of
an
officer
refers
to
orders
for
the
commission
or
the
prohibition
of
discretionary
acts,
not
the
incorporation
by
police
officers
of
the
criminal
law...
of
specific
provisions
of
the
criminal
law,
so
i
don't
think
that
analogy
gets
you
anywhere.
do
you
agree
with
me
that
there
is
at
least
an
essential
difference
between
the
offense
of
criminal
contempt
and
the
offense,
let's
say,
of
burglary,
in
the
sense
that
there
are
no
specific
elements
of
the
offense
of
criminal
contempt?
you
cannot
charge
a
criminal
contempt
without
something
more,
i.e.,
a
court
order.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you've
got
to
have
a
court
order.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
it's
proving
in
the
criminal
contempt
case
is,
if
you
will,
the
analog
of
the
content
of
the
law,
whereas
in
your
example
of
the
false
statement,
what
it
is
proving
is
the
act
which
happened
also
to
be
a
violation
of
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that
the
issue
in
this
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--whether
it
counts
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
not
claiming
that
if
there
had
not
been
an
order
here
saying
don't
commit
a
crime,
that
he
could
have
been
held
in
contempt...
criminal
contempt
of
court
if
he
had
committed--
justice
david
h.
souter
suppose
he
were
acquitted
on
the
basis
of
identity.
it
was...
the
assault...
in
the
foste
case
the
assault
was
committed
by
someone
else,
he
still
could
be
tried
on
the
assault
charge
if
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
is
an
ashe
v.
swenson
collateral
estoppel
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
i
don't
understand
why
you
would
be
estopped
in
that
case,
because
in
the
instance
in
which
you've
just
described
there
would
indeed
have
been
an
element
not
peculiar
to
the
criminal
statute
itself,
i.e.,
notice
of
the
court
order,
and
therefore
the
acquittal
of
the
criminal
contempt
would
not
necessarily
imply
a
finding
inconsistent
with
any
of
the
elements
of
the
criminal
offense
alone.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
were
just
saying
on
estoppel
principles
apart
from--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
klein,
accepting
that
point,
is
there...
do
you
agree
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
dixon
and
the...
what
is
it,
the--
--foster.
i
can't
read...
foster
cases
in
the
sense
that
in
the
dixon
case
the
authority
of
the
court
in
this
case
to
grant
pretrial
release
could
have
been
vindicated
by
revoking
the
pretrial
release
for
the
commission
of
the
crime,
whereas
in
foster
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
practical
way...
the
domestic
relations
case,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
practical
way
that
the
court
could
enforce
its
order
except
by
means
of
some
kind
of
a
criminal
contempt
sentence.
a
civil
contempt
proceeding,
for
example,
i
suppose
simply
would
not
have
been
efficacious.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
indeed
they
did,
i
don't
dispute
that.
i
mean,
the
point
of
my
question
was,
i
guess,
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
necessity
analysis,
that
would
be
a
predicate
for
different
results
in
the
two
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
klein,
your
model
of
coordinated
law
enforcement
might
work
fine
for
dixon.
how
does
it
work
for
foster?
because
isn't
the
point...
leaving
aside
the
rhetoric
of
the
court's
dignity,
and
so
on,
isn't
the
point
of
a
court
that
is
administering
a
domestic
relations
case
load,
as
the
foster
court
was,
that
it's
got
to
be
able
to
vindicate
itself
in
a
hurry
if
it's
going
to
have
any
effectiveness
in
enforcing
its
orders
at
all?
so
that
in
foster's
case,
if
in
fact
the
assault
had
been
committed,
and
if
we
assume,
as
i
think
we
do
commonly
assume,
that
there's
got
to
be
some
kind
of
a
criminal
rather
than
civil
contempt
remedy,
it
wouldn't
have
been
any
answer
to
the
concern
of
the
court...
the
legitimate
concern
of
the
court
for
the
prosecutor
to
say,
well,
i'll
bring
in
information
and
we'll
put
this
down
on
the
trial
calendar
and
i
will
include
a
contempt
count
as
well
as
a
substantive
assault
count.
i
don't
know
how
many
weeks
or
months
would
go
by
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
the
fact
is,
if
that
were
the
procedure
the
trial
court
would
be
left
with
no
immediate
means
to...
in
effect
to
vindicate
its
order
and
no
immediate
means
to
have
an
effective
order.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the
consequence,
though,
of
applying
that
kind
of
a
rationale
in
this
situation
that
the
possibility
of
enforcing
these
kinds
of
domestic
relations
injunctions
is
pretty
well
foregone?
because
you
can't...
i
mean,
as
a
practical
matter
you
can't
enforce
them
unless
you
can...
unless
you
have
some
credible
interrorum
mechanism,
and
the
truth
is
that
a
prosecution
weeks
or
months
later
is
far
less
effective
than
a
criminal
contempt
trial
which
can
be
begun
on
pretty
short
notice.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we've
got
a
separate...
i
mean,
as
the
other
side
has
said,
there
is
a
separate
interest
here.
we're
trying
to
run
the
courts
effectively,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
separate
and
legitimate
interest
in
addition
to
the
general
public
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
so
much
the
court's
interest.
the
fact
is,
the
only
way
to
make
these
orders
effective
in
order
to
vindicate
the
interests
of
the
people
who
are
getting
beaten
up
is
in
fact
to
have
some
very
rapid
procedure
for
retribution
if
they
are
violated.
that
isn't
just
the
court's
interest,
that
is
the
interest
of
the
victims.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
else
are
you
going
to
enforce
these
orders?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
agree
that
preventive
detention
would
work
in
the
example
that
i
was
giving.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
for
a
minute?
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
criminal
contempt
can
be
charged,
preventive
detention
can
be
imposed
in
the
foster
situation,
and
prosecution
can
take
place
subsequently
in
the
normal
course,
so
that
as
a
practical
matter
you
get
the
offender
away
from
the
victim?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
so,
isn't
that
the
problem
of
the
state,
not
the
problem
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
