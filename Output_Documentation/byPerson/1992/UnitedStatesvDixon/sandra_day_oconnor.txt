justice

now,
would
the
prosecutor
in
those
subsequent
criminal
proceedings
prove
anything
that
wasn't
already
proved
at
the
contempt
hearings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
literally
it
falls
within
at
least
the
language
of
grady
v.
corbin.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
this
court
in
menna
and
in
colombo
at
least
indicated
that
it
thought
perhaps
double
jeopardy
applied
in
contempt
situations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
what
could
the
prosecutor
have
done
here
when
receiving
knowledge
of
what,
for
example,
mr.
dixon
had
done?
could
dixon
have
been
detained
and
jailed
pending
the
criminal
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
there
is
a
concern
here.
i
mean,
these
cases
can
involve
people
who
feel
that
their
life
and
safety
is
threatened
and
they
need
some
protection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
could
the
prosecutor
have
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
court
deprived
the
prosecutor,
possibly,
of
the
option
of
going
ahead
with
the
criminal
charges
if
double
jeopardy
attaches.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
the
prosecutor
never
knew
about
the
contempt
proceedings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
your
position
mean
that
any
time
a
criminal
defendant
having
been
convicted
and
let's
say
placed
on
probation
on
typical
terms,
which
is
that
you
be
law-abiding,
and
then
the
probationer
is
brought
in
back
to
the
sentencing
court
because
of
committing
some
criminal
offense,
not
remaining
law-abiding,
and
so
the
probation
is
revoked.
now,
would
you
say
double
jeopardy
prevents
any
subsequent
prosecution
there
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
probation
would
be
revoked
by
proving
the
commission
of
the
offense,
so
you're
right
back
where
you
are
in
this
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
is
foster's
prosecution
treated
that
way?
the
u.s.
attorney
wasn't
involved
in
that.
mrs.
foster
came
in
and
prosecuted
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
wonder
if
that's
accurate
in
the
context
in
which
these
things
arise.
mrs.
foster
went
to
court
in
connection
with
a
domestic
proceeding
to
get
some
protection.
why
should
the
subsequent
contempt
proceeding
be
treated
like
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
under
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
i
suppose,
if
the
criminal
prosecution
occurred
first,
then
the
court
couldn't
subsequently
bring
a
contempt
proceeding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
work
both
ways--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
only
if
the
prosecution
were
brought
by
the
prosecutor
simultaneously,
the
two,
could
there
be
any
possibility
of
both
goals
being
achieved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
certainly
is
a
surprising
development
in
the
law,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
long
can
preventive
detention
last
under
the
d.c.
code,
and
what
are
the
grounds
for
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
unusual,
because
at
least
in
federal
law
it's
been
very
much
circumscribed.
