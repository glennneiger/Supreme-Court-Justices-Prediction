your
horrible
example
about
failing
to
prove
notice
to
the
greater--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
would
apply
to
any
greater
and
lesser
offense
situation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
which
the
government
fails
to
prove
the
element
that
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--unique
to
the
greater
offense.
justice
anthony

but

disagree
with
that
general
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
important
to
confine
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
much
as
we
can,
of
course,
yes.
