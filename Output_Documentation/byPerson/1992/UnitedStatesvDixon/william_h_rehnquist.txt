we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1231,
united
states
v.
alvin
j.
dixon.
mr.
bryson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
spectators
are
admonished,
the
court
remains
in
session.
there's
to
be
no
talking
in
the
courtroom.

mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
bryson,
so
supposing
someone,
a
spectator
during
a
jury
trial
in
a
trial
court
just
gets
up
and
starts
yelling,
he
can
be
held
in
contempt,
can't
he,
without
showing
that
he
violated
any
particular
order
of
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
the
government
in
its
brief,
i
think,
one
of
it's
arguments
is
that
contempts
have
traditionally
been
regarded
as
separate
from
the
substantive
offenses,
and
you
cite
a
number
of
cases.
are
you
going
to
leave
that
argument
to
your
brief,
or
are
you
going
to
discuss
it
during
your
oral
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
klein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
contend,
do
you,
mr.
klein,
that
these
offenses
don't
meet
the
blockburger
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
i
say,
meet
the
blockburger
test,
i
mean
that
each
contains
an
element
that
the
other
doesn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
an
ambiguous
question,
at
which
side
of
the
fence
you're
looking
at
at
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
have
to
bring
together
the
contempt
prosecution
and
the
substantive
criminal
offense
prosecution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
novel
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
totally
novel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
never
heard
of
it
being
done.
have
you
ever
heard
of
it
being
done?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
bloom
was
decided,
what,
25
years
ago.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
it
were
decided
last
year.
one
would
have
expected
to
see
a
rash
of
these
double
prosecutions
that
you
refer,
if
that's
now
required.
but
you
say
you
have
one
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
talking...
you
say
you
only
have
one
example
of
it
being
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
no
one
has
contested
the
double
jeopardy
aspect
of
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
referred
to
it
as
a
noncriminal
sanction.
certainly
a
pretrial...
i
take
it
you're
referring
to
a
pretrial
detention.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
pretrial
detention
isn't
available
except
as
an
incident
to
a
criminal...
a
serious
criminal
prosecution,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
the
case
is
submitted.
