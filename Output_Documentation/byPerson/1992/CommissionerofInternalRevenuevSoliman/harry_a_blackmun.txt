okay.
mr.
jones,
section
280
is
confined
to
a
dwelling
unit,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
whatever
we
decide
here
is
rather
narrowly
restricted.
let
me
change
the
facts
a
little
bit.
suppose
this
taxpayer
had
rented
a
place
in
an
office
building
instead
of
his
home.
what
would
the
sg's
position
be
as
to
that?
would
it
be
deductible?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
under
different
sections
of
the
code.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
my
hypothetical
assumes
no
other
change
in
the
facts.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
all
he
does,
he
spends
as
much
time
in
the
rented
office
as
he
did
at
home.
and
there
you
would
allow
the
deduction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
you
would
have
a
better
case
if
your
client
were
an
internist
and
saw
patients
in
his
home?
