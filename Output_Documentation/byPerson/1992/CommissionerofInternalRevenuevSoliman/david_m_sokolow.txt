mr.
david
m.
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
to
resolve
the
controversy
which
has
arisen
between
the
tax
court
and
the
commissioner
over
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
phrase
principal
place
of
business
for
purposes
of
claiming
home
office
deductions
under
internal
revenue
code
section
280a.
this
case
arose
from
the
commissioner's
use
of
the
focal
point
test
to
deny
a
home
office
deduction
to
dr.
nader
soliman.
under
the
focal
point
test
a
taxpayer's
principal
place
of
business
is
the
location
where
goods
and
services
are
provided
to
his
customers
and
revenues
are
generated.
however,
when
a
taxpayer's
business
is
based
in
his
home
but
his
services
are
provided
elsewhere
the
focal
point
test
automatically
prevents
the
deduction
of
what
would
otherwise
be
completely
legitimate
expenses.
this
illogical
result
is
in
no
way
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
congress
enacted
section
280a
to
prevent
taxpayers
from
deducting
expenses
for
home
offices
maintained
solely
for
their
personal
convenience.
in
denying
a
deduction
to
a
taxpayer
whose
business
requires
the
use
of
a
home
office,
the
focal
point
test
goes
far
beyond
the
intent
of
congress.
the
tax
court
recognized
the
injustice
of
the
focal
point
test
and
devised
a
reasonable
and
logical
interpretation
of
the
entire
phrase
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice,
it
primarily
ruled
out
deductions
for
employees
who
were
maintaining
home
offices
merely
for
their
personal
convenience.
they
were
being
provided
with
an
office
on
the
job
site
but
they
were
doing
some
work
at
home,
and
this
statute
eliminated
that.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
principal
does,
the
word
itself
connotes
some
type
of
comparison.
in
the
purpose,
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
however,
i
don't
think
that
comparison
is
necessary.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
i
think
the
findings
of
the
soliman
case
show
that
those
type
of
comparisons
can't
be
made
in
this
type
of
case
by
the
nature
of
the
functions
that
are
performed.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
i
believe
that
the
word
principal
was
used
because
primarily
in
the
case
of
these
employees
they
were
trying
to
claim
that
they
had
two
places
of
business,
and
only
the
one
at
their
employer's
location
was
their
primary
place
of
business.
they
were
using
a
secondary
office
merely
for
their
personal
convenience.
so
they
had
two
office
locations,
and
i
think
the
word
principal
was
chosen
to
differentiate
between
the
two
and
eliminate
the
use
of
the
home
office.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
applies
to
all
taxpayers,
independent
contractors
and
employees.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
in
the
context
of
this
statute
i
think
principal
place
of
business
has
a
specific
definition.
you
don't
need
to
take
apart
each
word
and
try
to
define
principal.
i
think
what
the
court
has
done
is
devise
a
test
to
determine
whether
a
home
office
is
the
principal
place
of
business
using
that
phrase
as
a
term
of
art.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
no,
i
don't
believe
it's
any
place
of
business.
it
has
to
be
the
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
i
affirm
that
the
content,
the
definition
of
that
is
now
the
new
soliman
test,
that
it's
being
applied
specifically
in
the
context
of
a
home
office
deduction.
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about
with
the
statute.
they
weren't
trying
to
define
principal
place
of
business
for
diversity
purposes
or
any
other
purpose,
they
were
just
looking
on
whether
we
should
allow
a
home
office
deduction.
and
that's
all
this
new
definition
does.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
no,
i
don't.
there
could
be
more--
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
--no,
i
believe...
we're
looking
at
whether
a
home
office
deduction
is
allowable,
and
if
we're
just
looking
at
which
is
the
location
for
the
home
office
deduction,
principal
place
of
business
can
only
be
one
location.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
under
the
new
soliman
test
if
that
office
is
used
for
his
business
purposes
then
his
home
office
would
not
be
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
that's
correct.
the
availability
of
an
office
which
meets
all
the
requirements
of
the
taxpayer's
business
would
take
him
out
of
the
soliman
test
and
his
home
office
then
could
not
be
considered
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
if
we
assume
that
the
only
space
he
was
given
in
the
hospital
was
to
store
records
as
opposed
to
do
the
rest
of
his
business
then
it
wouldn't
change
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
what
the
court
found
is
that
the
office
has
to
be
available
to
the
taxpayer,
and
that
is
determined
under
all
facts
and
circumstances.
that's
where
that
analysis
comes
from.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
if
dr.
soliman
could
do
all
his
business
functions
in
that
office
in
the
hospital--
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
--i
need
to
differentiate
between
what
he
did
and
what
he
could
do.
if
that
office
was
available
for
him
to
do
all
those
functions
then
he
would
not
get
the
home
office
deduction.
if
he
could
have
done
his
billing
work
at
the
hospital
office
but
he
chose
to
do
it--
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
--then
i
believe
the
essential
nature
of
the
rest
of
those
functions
would
still
entitle
him
to
a
home
office
deduction.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
if
he
saw
patients
in
his
home,
your
honor,
there
is
a
separate
section
of
280a
that
would
automatically
entitle
him
to
the
deduction.
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
defined
as
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
an
essential
place
of
business
is
one
of
the
three
parts
of
the
soliman
test,
so
that
would
be
one
factor
that
would
have
to
be
considered.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
excuse
me?
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
in
addition
to
that
it
needs
to
be
essential--
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
--you
need
to
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
time
there.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
and
there
has
to
be
no
other
location
available
to
perform
the
office
functions
of
the
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
these
are
from
the
court's
ruling.
that's
the
three
part
test
that
they
developed.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
yes,
it
would.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
the
theory
is
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute.
they
did
not
want
people
deducting
expenses
for
the
use
of
their
home
unless
they
absolutely
had
to
have
a
home
office
there.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
in
that
circumstance
if
his
brother
had
an
office
that
he
could
have
used
to
do
all
his
functions
for
his
business,
yes,
he
would
lose
the
deduction.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
well,
i
wouldn't
define
essential
as
there's
no
other
place.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
the
lower
court
described
it
as
essential
to
the
nature
of
the
functions
performed
there,
that
the
office
was
essential
to
his
business.
if
he
did
not
perform
his
administrative
functions
he
could
not
continue
in
business.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
that's
correct.
the
soliman
test
is
entirely
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
it
will
allow
a
home
office
deduction
in
only
limited
and
specified
circumstances.
as
a
result
it
continues
to
prevent
the
abuses
which
occurred
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
these
abuses
resulted
from
the
tax
court's
use
of
the
appropriate
and
helpful
standard
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
taxpayer
was
entitled
to
claim
a
home
office
deduction.
that
standard
permitted
a
typical
9
to
5
employee
to
place
a
typewriter
in
his
den,
call
it
an
office,
and
deduct
part
of
his
monthly
rent
and
utility
bills.
the
soliman
test
is
not
a
reaffirmation
of
the
appropriate
and
helpful
standard.
it
is
much
stricter
than
that
standard
because
it
requires
a
finding
that
the
home
office
is
essential
to
the
taxpayer's
business.
in
addition
the
soliman
test
incorporates
the
requirements
of
section
280a
that
the
office
be
used
exclusively
and
regularly
for
business
purposes
and
that
an
employee
will
be
entitled
to
a
home
office
deduction
only
if
the
office
is
used,
is
maintained
for
the
convenience
of
his
employer.
these
crucial
requirements
were
not
a
part
of
the
appropriate
and
helpful
standard.
the
soliman
test
is
also
a
more
logical
and
rational
approach
than
the
comparative
analysis
now
proposed
by
the
commissioner.
in
establishing
the
soliman
test
the
tax
court
acknowledged
that
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
home
office
was
one
of
several
important
factors
to
consider.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
that's
a
determination
that's
going
to
have
to
be
made
by
the
fact
finders.
it's--
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
--dr.
soliman
spent
30
percent
of
his
time
in
his
home
office.
i
consider
that
substantial.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
if
that
office
is
essential
to
his
business
and
he
has
no
other
location
available
to
perform
those
functions--
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
--for
purposes
of
a
home
office
deduction,
correct.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
i
understand
conceptually
principal
we
automatically
want
to
say
which
is
more
important,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
with
this
statute.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
that
the
test
developed
by
the
court
in
this
case
will
accomplish
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
justice
scalia,
they
enacted
that
phrase
but
they
gave
us
no
clue
of
what
they
intended
that
specific
phrase
to
mean.
all
that
the
tax
court
has
now
done
is
set
up
a
test
that
will
determine
whether
or
not
a
taxpayer's
home
office
is
a
principal
place
of
business.
we're
not
telling
congress
that
they
were
right
or
wrong.
the
court
is
just
saying
this
is
now
going
to
be,
this
is
now
the
test
to
interpret
that
phrase.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
yes,
i
do.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
the
commissioner
also
contends
that
the
relative
importance
of
the
functions
performed
at
the
various
business
locations
must
be
compared
to
determine
whether
a
taxpayer's
home
office
is
his
principal
place
of
business.
the
tax
court,
however,
rejected
this
comparison
of
functions
in
favor
of
a
more
appropriate
test.
rather
than
require
a
finding
that
a
home
office
is
more
important
than
another
business
location
the
soliman
test
requires
that
the
office
be
essential
to
the
taxpayer's
business.
there
is
no
higher
standard
than
essential.
it
is
defined
as
something
indispensable.
this
requirement
of
the
soliman
test
makes
a
comparison
of
functions
meaningless.
once
it
has
been
determined
that
a
home
office
is
essential
to
the
taxpayer's
business
it
simply
cannot
be
less
important
than
another
business
location.
in
his
efforts
to
reverse
this
case
the
commissioner
has
repeatedly
overstated
the
impact
of
the
soliman
test.
he
contends
that
the
soliman
test
will
vastly
expand
the
class
of
taxpayers
entitled
to
claim
home
office
deductions.
there
is
simply
no
merit
to
that
contention.
this
class
will
be
expanded
to
include
only
a
select
group
of
taxpayers
who
are
being
unjustly
denied
home
office
deductions
under
the
focal
point
test.
these
taxpayers
must
be
engaged
in
businesses
which
require
essential
organizational
and
management
functions
which
are
distinct
from
the
services
provided
to
their
customers.
they
must
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
time
on
these
administrative
functions
and
they
must
have
no
other
location
available
to
perform
these
functions
of
their
business.
the
impact
of
the
soliman
test
will
be
substantially
less
than
professed
by
the
commissioner.
the
commissioner
also
contends
that
teachers
who
grade
papers
at
home
will
be
entitled
to
claim
a
home
office
deduction
merely
because
they
lack
after
hours
access
to
their
school.
on
the
contrary,
both
the
soliman
test
and
the
specific
language
of
section
280a
will
deny
home
office
deductions
to
these
teachers
for
three
reasons.
first,
they
are
provided
with
fully
adequate
offices
on
the
job
site.
second,
they
take
work
home
with
them
merely
because
it
is
more
convenient
to
do
so.
maintaining
a
home
office
is
not
essential
to
their
business.
and
third,
as
employees
of
their
school
systems
teachers
will
be
entitled
to
claim
a
home
office
deduction
only
if
the
office
is
required
as
a
condition
of
their
employment.
few
if
any
school
systems
have
such
a
requirement.
the
soliman
test
is
a
realistic
recognition
of
the
way
a
modern
business
is
conducted.
it
recognizes
that
businessmen
such
as
dr.
soliman
often
need
to
perform
essential
administrative
functions
for
the
continued
maintenance
and
growth
of
their
business.
if
no
location
is
provided
to
perform
these
administrative
functions
they
are
entirely
justified
in
establishing
an
office
in
their
home.
there
is
simply
no
basis
to
conclude
that
congress
would
have
objected
to
the
deduction
of
a
home
office
expense
by
a
taxpayer
such
as
dr.
soliman.
mr.
david
m.
sokolow
justice
scalia,
i
would
agree
with
counsel
for
the
commissioner
that
where
those
services
are
provided
should
not
be
the
exclusive
test,
that
management
function
should
be
considered.
i
think
the
exception
for
a
place
of
business
for
meeting
of
clients
recognized
that
doctors
and
professional
people
of
that
nature
who
maintain
those
offices
often
had
an
office
in
their
home
just
to
meet
with
clients
and
a
separate
office
where
they
did
their
administrative
work,
and
that
was
not
causing
a
problem.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
was
causing
the
problem,
and
it
was
not
independent
contractors
such
as
dr.
soliman.
it
was
not
psychiatrists
who
treated
patients
in
their
home
and
had
a
separate
office.
it
was
employees
who
were
taking
these
deductions
merely
for
their
personal
convenience.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
this
decision,
not
just
to
uphold
the
validity
of
the
deduction
taken
by
dr.
soliman
but
more
importantly
to
allow
small
businessmen
living
in
jurisdictions
other
than
the
fourth
circuit
the
home
office
deductions
which
are
being
denied
to
them
by
the
commissioner
in
his
use
of
the
focal
point
test.
thank
you.
