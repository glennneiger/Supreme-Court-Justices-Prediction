justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
jones,
do
you
measure
the,
do
you
get
your
answer
solely
by
looking
at
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
various
locations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
this
particular
case
i
guess
the
doctor
had
three
hospitals
he
went
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
one
of
them
a
lot
more
time
was
spent
than
in
the
office.
supposing
he
went
to
eight
hospitals
and
each
of
them
he
spent
less
time
than
the
home
office,
precisely
the
same
amount
of
time
in
the
home
office
that
he
did
in
this
case.
would
he
then
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one,
it's
either
yes
or
no.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
we've
got
all
that
in
this
case.
he
does
his
bookkeeping,
his
phone
calls,
his
computer,
whatever
he
has,
his
files.
that's
what
he
has
there.
now,
is
that
enough
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
eight
hospitals
instead
of
three.
that's
a
very
simple
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
know
in
this
case,
mr.
jones.
i
want
this...
really
you
can't...
can
you
have
two
separate
cases
on
precisely
the
same
facts,
one
in
washington
and
one
in
new
york,
and
have
them
come
out
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
really
saying
in
my,
the
case
i
give
to
you,
there
is
no
right
answer?
the
fact
finder
can
do
just
what
he
wants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
when
you--
--excuse
me,
go
ahead,
no
please.
i
was
just
going
to
say
under
your
argument
the
doctor
could
never
have
a
home
office
because
it's
always
more
important,
he
makes
most
of
his
money
performing
operations
in
the
hospital
and
it's
certainly
more
important
than
keeping
the
books
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
really
what
your
position
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you
would
say
the
same
if
he
spent
90
percent
at
home
and
did
10
very
valuable
and
important
operations.
that
would
still
be
more
important
than
what
he
did
at
home
under
your
approach.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you?
in
this
case
i
gather
the
doctor
had
both
billing
records
at
home
and
also
patient
records
that
describe
what
the
patients'
problems
were
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
that
he
had
just
the
billing
records
at
home
and
he
had
the
records
that
dealt
with
particular
treatment
for
patients
in
some
office
at
a
hospital
that
was
provided
by
the
hospital.
would
then
the
home
still
be
a
principal
place
of
business?
and
say
the
timing
was
exactly
as
it
is
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
he
had
a
desk
and
a
chair
there
and
he
made
some
entries
on
the
patient
records
and
so
forth
but
he
didn't
do
his
billing
from
there.
he
did
his
billing
at
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
facts
and
circumstances
are
that
he
has
a
desk
and
a
chair
in
the
hospital
where
he
does
his,
keeps
track
of
who
his
patients
are
and
where
they
are,
but
he
does
all
his
billing
and
credit
work
and
banking
and
so
forth
in
his
home
office.
can
he
still,
could
that
home
office
still,
and
assume
the
time
is
just
as
it
is
now,
would
that
home
office
still
qualify
as
a
principal
place
of
business
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
described
what
he
did
and
i'm
asking
you
what
the
result
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
let's
assume
he
could
not
have
done
that.
all
he
could
do
is
what
he
in
fact
did,
namely
keep
track
of
what
kind
of
anesthesia
he
gave
his
patients
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
but
then
it
also
has
to
be
exclusively
used
for
the
business
purpose
too,
doesn't
it?
that
still--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
commented
on
the
proposed
regulation.
is
there
anything
you'd
like
to...
that
tends
to
cut
against
you,
don't
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
can
be
the
principal
place
of
business--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
also
the
definition
of
principal
place
of
business
in
the
regulation
is
a
little
bit
different
from
your
position
with
regard
to
the
statutory
language,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
quite
as
literal,
at
least
as
justice
scalia
would
read
the
statute
in
his
questions.
