well,
if
you're
not
going
to
exclude
management
activities,
which
i
take
it
is
synonymous
with
what
i
think
you
referred
to
as
ancillary
activities
a
moment
ago--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
why
don't
you
simply
adopt
or
propose
that
we
adopt
a
straight
time
test,
wherever
the
taxpayer
spends
the
greater
part
of
the
time
will
be
the
principal
place.
we
won't
be
making
qualitative
judgments.
why
isn't
that
the
simplest
way
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
excludes
that
as
a
construction,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
of
course,
but
you're
admitting
that,
as
i
understand
it,
that
what
you
call
management
activities
or
the
place
of
management
activities
may
qualify
as
the
principal
place
of
business,
and
once
you
do
that
i
don't
know
why
your
insistence
on
some
qualitative
sense
of
importance
is
anything
but
just
injecting
a
kind
of
wild
card
for
the
fact
finder.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jones,
don't
you
recognize
or
won't
you
agree
that
what
you
refer
to
as
a
fact
finder's
determination
about
relative
importance
is
really
a
twofold
determination?
it's
a
determination
about
fact
in
the
first
instance,
but
it's
also
a
determination
of
value.
it's
not
merely
a
fact
finding.
and
you,
it
seems
to
me,
are
simply
leaving
the
legal
standard
to
the
fact
finder
under
the
guise
of
finding
facts
because
you
do
not
seem
to
recognize
any
standard
of
review,
any
legal
standard
for
this
concept
of
importance.
isn't
that
a
fair
criticism
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they're
making,
in
your
case
they're
making
some
law
too
because
they
are
determining
as
a
matter
of
law
what
is
important
and
what
is
unimportant.
and
they're
not
doing
it
on
any
strictly
factual
basis
such
as
time
or
such
as
relationship
to
essential
activity.
it's
up
to
them.
