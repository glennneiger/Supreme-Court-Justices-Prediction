is
the
problem
that
you
have
in
answering
justice
stevens'
question
the
concession
that
i
believe
you
made
in
your
brief
that
there
is
always
a
principal
place
of
business?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
concede
that
there
is
always
a
principal
place
of
business
or
do
you
argue
that
in
some
cases,
say
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
or
a
traveling
salesman
who
just
goes
to
100
different
places,
that
there
is
no
principal
place
of
business
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
statute
and
your
position.
is
it
your
position
that
in
the
case
before
us
there
is
somewhere
out
there
a
principal
place
of
business?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
correct
that
in
your
brief
you
conceded
the
proposition
that
at
least
in
this
case
there
is
a
principal
place
of
business,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
difficulty
of
your
position.
i
simply
don't
know
why
you
concede
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
do
you
get
the
requirement
of
no
other
available
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
principal
place
of
business?
suppose
the
hospital
does
offer
the
doctor
a
full
office
facility
but
he
never
uses
it?
same
facts
as
this
except
that
he
could
use
an
office
in
the
hospital.
that
would
change
the
case
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
what
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
he
has
his
brother
who
has
a
free
office
that's
not
being
used
right
next
to
him?
does
he
lose
his
principal
place
of
business
deduction?
i
just
don't
understand
the
rationale
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
requires
us
to
consider
the
circumstances
in
which
a
taxpayer
may
claim
a
deduction
on
his
federal
income
tax
return
for
the
expense
of
an
office,
that
is
located
within
the
taxpayer's
personal
residence.
the
case
involves
a
medical
doctor,
who
sought
a
deduction
for
a
home
office
and
the
respondent,
a
doctor
solimon
is
an
anesthesiologist.
during
the
tax
year
in
question,
which
was
1983,
he
practice
his
profession
in
maryland
and
virginia,
he
spent
30
to
35
hours
a
week
with
patient
at
hospital
and
divided
that
time
among
three
different
hospitals.
at
the
hospitals
the
doctor
administered
the
anesthesia,
he
cared
for
the
patients
after
the
surgery,
and
he
treated
the
patients
with
pain.
soliman
lived
in
the
condominium
in
the
mclean,
virginia,
the
condominium
contain
the
spare
bedroom,
which
he
used
exclusively
as
an
office.
he
did
not
meet
patients
there.
he
did
spend
two
to
three
hours
a
day
in
the
home
office
on
a
variety
of
tasks;
such
as
contacting
patients,
surgeons,
and
hospitals
by
telephone,
maintaining
billing
records
and
patients
logs
and
preparing
for
treatments
and
presentations
and
satisfying
continuing
medical
education
requirements
and
reading
medical
journals
and
books.
on
his
1983
income
tax
returns,
soliman
claimed
deductions
that
the
portion
of
the
condominium
fees,
utilities,
and
deppreciation
attributable
to
the
home
office.
on
audio,
the
commissioner
disallowed
the
deductions
based
upon
his
determination
that
his
home
office
was
not
soliman's
principal
place
of
business
within
the
meaning
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
its
the
phrase
"principal
place
of
business"
that
must
be
construed
to
determinee
this
case.
soliman
petitioned
the
tax
court
for
review,
which
ruled
that
the
home
office
was
soliman's
principal
place
of
business.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
in
a
decision
for
a
devided
panel.
it
adopted
the
test
used
by
the
tax
court,
and
that
test
suggested
that
the
presence
of
three
factors
must
be
given
heavy
weight
in
favor
of
finding
that
the
home
office
is
the
principal
place
of
business.
one
that
the
home
office
is
essential
to
the
taxpayer's
business;
two
that
he
spends
a
substantial
amount
of
time
there;
and
three
that
there
is
no
other
location
available
for
the
performance
of
the
office
functions
of
the
business.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
contrary
at
the
court
of
appeals
suggestion
the
statute
does
not
allow
for
deduction,
whenever
a
home
office
maybe
characterizes
as
legitimate
in
deciding
whether
a
location
is
the
principal
place
of
business,
a
common
sense
mean
of
principle
suggests
that
comparison
of
locations
must
be
undertaken.
in
determining
the
proper
test
for
deciding
whether
a
home
office
is
the
principal
place
of
business,
we
cannot
develop
an
objective
formula
that
yields
a
clear
answer
in
every
case.
there
are
however
two
primary
considerations
in
deciding
whether
a
home
office
is
a
taxpayer's
principal
place
of
business:
the
relative
importance
of
the
activities
performed
at
each
business
location
and
the
time
spent
at
each
place.
as,
part
of
this
analysis
the
point
where
goods
and
services
are
delivered
must
be
given
great
weight
in
determining
the
place
where
the
most
important
functions
are
performed.
the
practice
of
anesthesiology
requires
the
medical
doctor
to
treat
patients
under
conditions
demanding
immediate
personal
observation,
so
exacting
with
these
requirements
that
all
of
the
respondent's
patients
were
treated
at
hospitals,
facilities
with
special
characteristics
designed
to
accommodate
the
demands
of
the
profession.
actual
treatment
was
the
essence
of
the
professional
service.
we
consume
that
careful
planning
and
study
were
required
in
advance
of
performing
the
treatment
and
all
acknowledged
that
this
was
done
on
the
home
office,
but
the
actual
treatment
was
the
most
significant
event
in
the
professional
transaction.
the
comparison
of
the
time
spent
by
the
taxpayer
further
supports
the
determination
that
the
home
office
was
not
the
principal
place
of
business.
10-15
hours
per
weeks
spent
in
the
home
office
measured
against
the
30-35
hours
per
week
at
the
three
hospitals
are
insufficient
to
render
the
home
office
the
principal
place
of
business
in
light
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
that
the
office
may
have
been
essential
is
not
controlling.
hence,
the
taxpayer
was
not
entitled
the
deduction
for
home
expenses.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
