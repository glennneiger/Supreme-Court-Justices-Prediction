mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
home
office
expenses
are
a
conceptual
hybrid
of
business
expenses,
which
are
generally
deductible,
and
personal
expenses,
which
generally
are
not.
prior
to
1976
most
courts
concluded
that
the
expenses
of
a
home
office
may
be
deducted
if
the
office
was
appropriate
and
helpful
to
the
taxpayer's
business.
in
1976,
however,
congress
concluded
that
that
broad
standard
should
be
rejected
because
it
was
too
difficult
to
administer
and
too
prone
to
abuse.
in
its
place
congress
enacted
section
280a
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
establish
a
detailed
set
of
restrictive
criteria
for
home
office
deductions.
as
relevant
to
this
case,
the
statute
now
permits
a
deduction
only
if
the
home
office
is
used
exclusively
as
the
taxpayer's
principal
place
of
business.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
is
a
doctor
who
spends
approximately
70
percent
of
his
time
administering
medical
services
to
patients
at
hospitals,
principally
at
suburban
hospital
in
bethesda.
he
also
spends
approximately
30
percent
of
his
time
doing
paperwork
related
to
his
practice
in
an
office
at
his
home.
the
tax
court
and
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
doctor's
home
office
constitutes
his
principal
place
of
business
under
the
statute
because
the
office
is
essential
to
the
doctor's
business,
he
spends
a
substantial
amount
of
time
there,
and
he
maintains
no
other
office.
the
statute,
however,
does
not
permit
a
deduction
merely
because
essential
and
substantial
work-related
tasks
are
performed
at
home.
instead
it
plainly
requires
that
the
home
office
be
the
taxpayer's
principal
place
of
business.
as
this
court
has
consistently
held,
the
words
of
revenue
statutes
should,
where
possible,
be
given
their
ordinary
meaning,
and
in
malat
v.
riddell
this
court
held
that
in
ordinary
usage
the
word
principal
is
synonymous
with
primary
or
of
first
importance.
under
the
plain
language
of
section
280a,
therefore,
the
courts
must
make
a
comparison
of
each
of
the
various
locations
in
which
the
taxpayer
conducts
his
business
to
determine
which
one
of
them
is
primary
or
of
first
importance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
is
a
legal
standard
that
must
be
met,
which
is
what
i
just
described,
that
the
home
be
the
most
important
place
of
business.
the
factual
findings
of
the
tax
court
or
the
district
court
are
reviewed
on
a
clearly
erroneous
basis.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
that
is
the
logical
result
of
the
language,
and
in
fact
as
this
court
held
in
malat
v.
riddell,
principal
means
most
important.
you
can't
have
two
places
that
are
most
important.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certainly,
as
the
court
also
held
in
malat
v.
riddell,
the
word
substantial
cannot
be
equated
with
principal.
that
case
involved
a
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
required
a
finding
as
to
what
was
the
taxpayer's
primary
purpose
in
holding
certain
property,
and
the
court
held
in
malat
that
a
finding
that
the
taxpayer
had
a
substantial
purpose
of
holding
the
property
did
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
what
was
his
principal
purpose.
substantial
is
a
word
of
quantity.
principal
is
a
word
of
comparison.
you
can
have
many
substantial
activities,
but
you
can
only
have
one
principal
one.
you
can
have
many
substantial
locations
of
business,
but
you
can
only
have
one
principal
one.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
the
tax
courts
had
two
tests,
and
we
don't
recommend
either
one
of
them.
in
this
case
the
test
that
the
tax
court
applied
was
they
developed
as
a
rule
that
if
the
office
is
essential
to
the
taxpayer's
business--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
but
they
do--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
start
out
at
the
same
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
we
don't
apply...
they...
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
applied
two
tests.
they
said
they
were
going
to
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
which
we
think
is
the
appropriate
beginning
point.
but
then
they
said
that
we
can
answer
each
case
by
concluding
that
if
the
home
office
is
essential,
you
need
an
office,
and
if
there
is
a
substantial
use
made
of
that
office,
and
if
no
other
office
is
used
by
the
taxpayer,
that
will
be
his
primary
place
of
business.
that
is
the
portion
of
the
opinions
below
that
we
object
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
possible
to
view
it
that
way,
justice
white,
but
actually
we
think
that
the
tax
court
resurrected
a
sub
standard,
a
legal
standard
that
if
met
satisfies,
in
their
view,
the
statute.
and
we
think
their
sub
standard
is
wrong,
and
that
is
the
issue
that
we
presented
to
the
court
on
certiorari.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
we
agree
with
the
basic
principle
described
by
meiers
and
weissman
and
in
the
proposed
regulations,
which
is
that
you
look
to
both
the
time
spent
and
the
importance
of
the
activities
at
each
location.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
no,
actually--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--those
are
my
two
answers.
[laughter]
the
first
answer
is
that
the
fact
finder
as
a
matter
of
first
instance
is
entitled
to
make
a
determination
of
two
things.
what
was
his
principal
job
function.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
your
question
is
if
his
work
level
is
spread
throughout
many
areas--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
our
view
is
that
the
fact
finder
could
conclude
in
that
scenario
that
his
home
was
his
principal
place
of
business,
but
i
wish
to
point--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
finding
is
that
he
spends,
is
how
much
time
he
spends
at
various
locations
and
how
important
those
are,
and
then
from
those--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--fact
finders
sometimes
don't
agree
even
on
the
same
record,
but
we
think
that
there
are
sub
standards
that
the
courts
can
look
to
that
will
resolve
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
a
priori
i
don't
think
there
is
necessarily
a
correct
answer,
although
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that
was
the
second
answer
i
was
going
to
give
justice
stevens,
which
is
that
this
is
not
a
statute
in
which
the
government
has
to
establish
where
the
principal
place
of
business
is.
this
is
a
statute
where
the
taxpayer
has
to
establish
that
his
home
is
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
taking
the
word
most
important
to
its
logical
extreme
you
would
think
that
in
almost
every
case
a
fact
finder
could
find
a
location
that
was
most
important.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
our
position
under
the
statute
is
that
the
taxpayer
has
not
established
that
his
home
is
his
principal
place
of
business
and
that
is
all
that
this
case
requires.
it
is
also
our
position
and
the
tax
courts
have
found
that
the
hospital
is
necessarily
his
most
important
place
of
business.
the
tax
court
found
that
while
the
doctor's
activities
in
his
house
were
essential
to
his
medical
practice
they
were,
and
i
quote,
ancillary
to
the
primary
income
generating
services
he
performed
as
an
anesthesiologist
at
the
hospitals.
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
on
the
same
basic
facts
in
the
pomarantz
case,
the
location
where
you
spend
the
most
of
your
time
doing
your
most
important
business
functions
is
necessarily
your
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
this
case
we
affirmatively
state
that
the
hospital,
suburban
hospital,
is
his
principal
place
of
business,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
think
that
the
facts
permit
no
other
conclusion.
it
is
clear
from
the
facts
that
the
most
time
was
spent
at
suburban
hospital.
it
is
also
clear
from
the
tax
court's
findings
that
suburban
hospital
is
where
he
performed
his
most
important
functions.
when
you
spend
the
most
of
your
time
performing
your
most
important
functions
at
a
single
location,
that
is
necessarily
your
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
dissent
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
criticized
the
majorities
for
having
adopted
this
test
based
upon
essential
need,
substantial
use.
it
is
true
that
when
the
tax
court
started
out
writing
its
opinion
it
said
we're
going
to
look
to
facts
and
circumstances,
but
then
they
blinded
themselves
to
all
of
the
operations
of
the
doctor.
they
looked
only
to
his
management
activities.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
they
started
down
that
direction
but
they
went
a
step
that
was
not,
that
cannot
be
related
to
the
statute.
let
me
see
if
i
can
compare
what
the
tax
court
did
before
and
after
this
case.
originally
under
the
statute
the
tax
court
adopted
what
they
called
the
focal
point
test
which
looks
simply
to
the
location
where
goods
and
services
are
provided.
in
other
words
they
gave
no
weight
to
where
management
activities
were
conducted.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
think
that
that's
wrong.
the
statute
by
referring
to
principal
place
of
business
doesn't
exclude
management
activities
as
a
matter
of
course.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
the
office
where
the
taxpayer
spends
the
most
time.
it
says--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
in
our
view
there
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
principal
place
of
business
requires
some
reference
to
what
it
is
he
is
doing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
not
in
our
view
a
wild
card.
in
our
view
it
is
a
fundamental
relationship
to
what
congress
sought
to
do.
what
they
intended
to
do
was
to
allow
a
deduction
not
simply
because
the
taxpayer
used
the
office
a
lot,
but
only
when
it
was
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
scalia,
one
of
the
problems
with
answering
a
question
like
that
in
the
abstract
is
that
in
different
professions
the
primary,
the
relationship
between
the
primary
and
secondary
activities
is
not
going
to
be
the
same.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
a
card
that
has
a
different
value
from
case
to
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
my
view
a
wild
card
is
whatever
you
need
it
to
be.
in
this
case
we
think
it
is
a
card
that
has
a
different
value
based
upon
the
genuine
functions
of
the
enterprise.
let
me--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
actually
drucker
is
a
good
example
of
the
point.
drucker,
we're
willing
to
assume
that
the
importance
of
the
function
of
performing
compared
to
the
function
of
practice
is
closer
than
in
dr.
soliman's
case
where
we
think
that
the
provision
of
medical
services
is
much
greater
compared
to
sending
the
bills
out.
our
real
problem
with
the
drucker
case
is
not
with
the
legal
standard
it
applied.
drucker
said
what
we
think
is
the
law,
that
you
look
to
where
the
dominant
portion
of
the
work
was
performed
considering
the
time
and
the
importance
of
the
activities
involved.
our
problem
with
drucker
is
not
with
the
legal
standard
but
with
the
court's
management
of
the
record
in
that
case.
judge
van
graphlin
decided
that
case
based
upon
an
aphorism.
he
started
out
the
decision
by
telling
a
story
of
the
musician
who
is
walking
down
the
street
of
new
york.
a
stranger
stops
him
and
asks
him
what's
the
best
way
to
get
to
carnegie
hall,
and
the
musician
answers
practice,
practice,
practice.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
judge
van
graphlin
used
that
joke
to
determine
what
the
proper
weighting
of
the
various
activities
should
be.
he
concluded
that
practice
was
just
as
important
as
performance.
since
he
spent
more
time
practicing
his
home
office
is
his
principal
place
of
business.
our
view
about
drucker
is
simply
that
judge
van
graphlin
carried
the
joke
too
far.
he
shouldn't
have
used
it
as
a
basis
for
reversing
a
non-clearly
erroneous
fact
finding
as
to
where
the
principal
place
of
business
was.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
i
said
that
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
there
are
legal
sub
standards
that
guide
the
fact
finder.
the
legal
sub
standard
we
think
is
what
is
the
most
important
place
of
business.
we
think
there's
a
second
sub
standard
which
is
just
a
matter
of
logic,
and
that
is
where
you
spend
most
of
your
time
doing
your
most
important
work.
that's
your
principal
place
of
business.
it
is
clearly
a
fact
finding
as
to
where
you
spend
the
most
time.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's
drucker.
that's
the
concert
musician.
he
spent--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
answer
to
that
case
is
that
the
fact
finder
has
to
make
the
decision
in
the
first
instance.
if
i
were
the
fact
finder
i
would
have
concluded
that
the
concert
hall,
as
the
tax
court
did,
that
the
concert
hall
was
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
our
system
recognizes
that
fact
finders
if
they
are
not
clearly
erroneous
can
determine
basic
facts,
and
if
those
basic
facts
satisfy
the
legal
requirements
of
the
statute
then
there
is
no
basis
for
reversal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
probably
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
think
that
a
doctor
who
spent
70
percent
of
his
time
in
his
hospital
and
30
percent
of
his
time
sending
the
bills
out--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
have
an
a
priori
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
fact
finder
is
going
to
have
to
make
that
determination.
congress
gave
us
a
relatively
vague
but
nonetheless
principled
standard.
the
problem
with
the
decision
in
this
case
is
that
the
tax
court
and
court
of
appeals
adopted
a
sub
standard
that
does
not
satisfy
the
requirement
that
the
home
office
be
the
most
important
place
of
business.
instead
they
adopted
a
sub
standard
that
allows
a
deduction
for
the
most
important
office
of
the
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
it's
unfair
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
more
fair
than
criticizing
any
other
statute
that
requires
fact
findings
to
be
made
about
basic
facts.
fact
finders
are
in
the
business,
that
is
their
job
description.
they
are
judges,
they
make
judgments
about--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--exactly
the
same
result
applies
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
statute
which
also
makes
reference
to
principal
place
of
business.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized
that
the
fact
finder,
in
each
case
it
is
a
question
of
fact
as
to
where
the
dominant
portion
of
the
operations
of
the
business
were
conducted,
and
that
although
you
can
have
a
basic
sub
standard
the
sub
standard
in
this
case
is
where
did
you
spend
the
most
time
doing
your
most
important
work.
the
fact
finder
is
going
to
have
to
make
the
determination
about
what
is
most
important.
with
all
respect
to
judge
van
graphlin,
it
is
not
the
function
of
an
appellate
court
in
the
absence
of
a
clearly
erroneous
finding
to
come
up
with
a
different
result
about
relative
importance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
that
answers
every
question.
yes,
that
is
the
standard
that
we
propose
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--absolutely.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
the
ordinary
course
it
would
be
deductible
under
162
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
that's
really
the
point.
congress
was
skeptical
about
the
quality
of
proof
in
home
office
deduction
cases.
they
thought
that
the
general
standard
ordinary
and
necessary
was
prone
to
abuse.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
rented
office
be
a
principal
place
of
business.
congress
consciously
chose
for
homes
to
impose
more
restrictive
standards.
that's
the
whole
point
of
section
280a.
it's
not
that...
when
congress
said
that
it
was
too
difficult
to
administer
the
section
162
standard
for
home
offices
i
suppose
they
had
in
mind
the
fact
that
it's
unrealistic
for
the
commissioner
to
go
into
millions
of
taxpayers'
houses
to
find
out
how
they're
really
using
their
spare
bedrooms
as
offices.
so
congress
adopted
what
they
hoped
would
be
more
restrictive
and
more
definitive
rules
that
have
to
be
met
in
addition
to
the
normal
standards
of
162.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
commissioner
certainly
shares
that
desire.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
the
focal
point
test
that
the
tax
court
applied
before
this
case,
and
as
i
said
before,
we
think
the
problem
with
that
test...
and
the
commissioner
had
not
proposed
it,
the
tax
court
developed
it
on
its
own.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
problem
with
that
test
is
it
ignores
management
functions.
the
problem
with
the
test
of
the
court
of
appeals
here--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
have
an
a
priori
answer
to
that.
there
may
well
be
businesses
where
management
is
everything.
for
example
if
you
run
a
rental
car
company
and
you
have
only
licensees
around
the
country
and
all
you
do
in
managing
your
business
is
advise
them
on
how
to
run
their
business,
management
is
everything.
there
is
no
other
operation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
that
situation
his
home
would
probably
be
his
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
in
closing
is
that
deductions
are
a
matter
of
legislative
grace.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
language
that
congress
consciously
chose
to
erect
a
restrictive
prohibition
against
home
office
deductions,
and
from
ignoring
the
language
of
the
statute
the
court
reached
an
erroneous
conclusion
in
this
case
and
should
be
reversed.
reserve
the
balance,
please.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
fact
that
an
office
is
essential
to
a
business
cannot
satisfy
the
requirement
that
the
office
be
the
principal
place
of
business.
an
office
is
essential
to
almost
any
business.
as
we
know
from
the
baie
case,
even
a
hot
dog
stand
may
require
an
office
for
paperwork.
saying
that
an
office
is
essential
to
the
business
is
simply
another
way
of
saying
that
it's
an
ordinary
and
necessary,
appropriate
and
helpful
business
expense.
as
chief
judge
nims
said
in
his
dissent
in
this
case,
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
by
the
majority,
simply
resurrects
the
broad
standard
that
congress
expressly
rejected
in
enacting
section
280a.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
sounds
like
it
may
be
correct.
i
wouldn't
want
to
state
on
behalf
of
the
commissioner
a
definite
answer
to
that
hypothetical.
[laughter]
but
the
point
that
you're
making
is
the
same
one
that
i
discussed
with
justice
blackmun,
expenses
that
are
ordinary
and
necessary
to
the
business
that
are
not
involved
in
use
of
the
home
are
deductible
as
an
ordinary
matter.
but
congress
required
a
much
higher
standard,
did
it
for
the
very
purpose
of
restricting
home
office
deductions,
and
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
simply
is
not
faithful
to
the
language
that
congress
used.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
stevens,
the
proposed
regulation
says
exactly
what
we
think
is
right,
but
then
it
says
something
in
addition.
it
says
you
look
to
the
time
and
the
importance
of
the
activities
at
each
location,
and
then
it
has
a
sentence
at
the
end
that
was
made
much
of
below.
and
the
sentence
at
the
end
says
that
a
traveling
salesman
who
spends
a
lot
of
his
time
on
the
road
and
engages
in
substantial
activities
at
home
may
qualify
for
a
deduction.
that
has
been
the
commissioner's
position
since
1966.
we're
not,
we
don't
reject
that
position
now.
we
think
that
it
is
possible
for
a
fact
finder
in
that
situation
to
conclude
that
if
he
spends
40
percent
of
his
time
or
30
percent
of
his
time
in
his
house
doing
important
paperwork
for
his
sales
work
and
the
rest
of
his
60
percent
of
the
time
is
spread
among
100
different
locations--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
could
be.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
looking
at
the
time
and
the
importance
of
the
functions
performed
at
each
location
we
don't
think
the
statute
itself
provides
the
answer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
has
been
proposed
for
12
years.
[laughter]
of
course
the
statute
has
been
amended
twice
since
then
and
the
courts
have
generated
different
points
of
view--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
get
rid
of
it
by
withdrawing
it,
and
it
may
be
that
it
will
be
withdrawn.
certainly
it
cannot
be
adopted
in
its
current
form
because
this
statute
has
twice
been
amended
and
many
of
its
details
don't
relate
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
was
a
proposed
regulation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
we
don't...
one
of
the
reasons
i
haven't
emphasized
it
is
because
it
doesn't
seem
that
in
good
faith
we
can
rely
on
a
12-year-old
proposed
regulation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
gives
a
little
bit
more
emphasis
to
the
place
where
income
is
generated.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
there's
room
under
the
statute
to
agree
with
exactly
what
the
regulation
says,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
regulation,
by
emphasizing
slightly
more
where
the
income
is
generated,
really
adds
that
much
to
the
fundamental
inquiry
of
where
is
the
most
important
place
in
the
business.
that's
going
to,
different
industries
are
going
to
have
different
reactions
to
where,
is
it
important
where
they
sell
the
goods
or
where
they
make
them.
thank
you.
