chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-998,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
v.
nader
e.
soliman.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
was--
--mr.
jones,
the
tax
court
majority
found
for
the
taxpayer
and
the
dissenters
in
the
tax
court
criticized
the
majority
for
having
adopted
kind
of
a
facts
and
circumstances
test
that
would
really
furnish
no
guiding
principle.
and
yet
i
gather
that
you
really
think
it
is
strictly
a
facts
and
circumstances
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
think
that
the
majority
in
the
tax
court
applied
the
right
test,
they
just
didn't
get
the
right
result?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
sokolow,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sokolow,
what
do
you
think,
when
280a
was
adopted
what
deductions
do
you
think
that
ruled
out
that
could
have
been
taken
under
the
old
appropriate
and
helpful
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
that
it
ruled
out
also
deductions
where
the
word
principal
would
not
readily
apply?
i
think
the
government
makes
a
certain
amount
of
the
idea
that
principal
suggests
a
comparison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
what
is
left
of
the
word
principal
in
the
statute?
certainly
we,
if
we
have
to
throw
away
either
case
results
or
the
language
of
the
statute,
we
throw
away
the
case
results.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
the
word
principal
applies
to
a
claim
of
deduction
under
this
section
made
by
someone
who
is
not
an
employee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
where
better
to
look
than
at
the
words
it
actually
adopted,
which
was
the
word
principal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
have
to
decide
here
whether
the
test
that
the
tax
court
adopted
is
actually
consistent
with
the
phrase
principal.
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
it
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sokolow.
mr.
jones,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no
91-998,
commission
of
internal
revenue
versus
soliman
will
be
on
announce
by
justice
kennedy.
