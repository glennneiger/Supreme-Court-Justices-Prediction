mr.
jones,
what
is
the
standard
of
review?
is
it
de
novo
as
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
here,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
can
be
only
one
principal
place
of
business
under
the
statute?
i
mean,
is
that
the
notion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
fourth
circuit
view
and
test
that
we're
reviewing
do
you
think
it
leaves
it
open
to
find
more
than
one
principal
place
of
business?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
there
be
more
than
one
principal
place
of
business
in
a
given
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
the
fourth
circuit
test
leaves
open
that
possibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
that's
exactly
what
it
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
there's
another
office
that's
also
used?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
the
other
office
is
used
less
time?
