justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
give
both.
those
are
his
two
answers.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
not
a
wild
card
tell
us
what
it
is.
is
it
a
king
or
an
ace
or
a
deuce?
how
much
is
the
fact
that
the
activity
in
question
is
the
delivery
of
services
rather
than
administrative
activities,
management
activities,
how
much
is
that
worth?
each
minute
is
worth
3
minutes
of
management
activities,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
at
least
admit
it's
a
wild
card.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
a
wild
card
is.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
disagrees,
as
i
recall,
with
the
drucker
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
musician
who
spent
a
whole
lot
of
time
practicing
at
home
and
just
a
little
time
conducting
the
concert.
now,
you
disagree
with
that
because
you
think
the
concert
hall
was
the
principal
place
of
business.
why,
because
performance
is
worth
10
times
as
much
as
practice,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
old
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
spend
the
most
amount
of
time
doing
your
least
important
work?
i
mean,
it's
an
easy
question
if
you
spend
the
most
amount
of
time
doing
your
most
important
work.
i
guess
that's
easy.
what
if
you
spend
the
most
amount
of
time
doing
a
middling
importance
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
a
fact
finder
in
two
different
jurisdictions
with
the
same
facts
could
come
out
differently?
that
there's
no
rule
of
law
that
would
govern
that
case,
it's
simply
on
the
same
facts
different
judges
can
come
to
a
different
conclusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
standard
you
propose,
where
do
you
spend
the
most
amount
of
your
time
doing
your
most
important
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
will
always
be
a
principal
place
of
business--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
would
acknowledge
that
you
can
have
a
principal
place
of
business
that
does
not
produce
a,
that
is
not
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
can
we
adopt
at
least,
at
least
some
sub
rule
so
that
these
cases
don't
have
to
be
litigated
forever
and
ever?
it's
desirable
to
avoid
litigating
these
things
all
the
time,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
sub
rule
that
ordinarily
the
principal
place
of
business,
ordinarily,
even
though
you
don't
have
to
adopt
a
rigid
point
of
sale
rule,
that
almost
always
the
principal
place
of
business
will
be
where
the
goods
produced
are
sold
or
the
services
performed
are
rendered?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
want
to
ignore
them
in
most
cases.
i
mean,
you
say
that
they're
relatively
unimportant
compared
with...
practice,
practice,
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
it
means
then
as
applied
to
all
these
others,
what
does
it
mean?
what
does
the
word,
what
is
the
content
of
the
word
principal
in
the
statute
that
you
urge
upon
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
principal
place
of
business
means
the
same
thing
as
place
of
business?
they
should
have
really
said
place
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
what
does
it
mean
to
be
the
principal
place
of
business?
give
me
what
is
the
content
of
that
word
principal
that
you
affirm.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
from
your
response
to
justice
stevens
that
you
think
the
phrase
the
principal
place
of
business
should
be
understood
simply
to
mean
an
essential
place
of
business?
isn't
that
essentially
what
you're
urging
upon
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
necessary
in
addition
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
said
that,
an
essential
place
of
business.
what
in
addition
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
really
a
two
part
test.
i
mean
the
third
part
of
your
three
part
test
is
really
just
essential.
i
mean
we
say
an
essential
place
of
business,
it
means
that
there's
no
other
place
he
could
have
used.
that's
what
essential
means.
so
it's
two
parts.
it
has
to
be
an
essential
place
of
business,
and
number
two
he
has
to
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
time
there.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
what
does
it
mean
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
the
functions
performed
there
have
to
be
essential.
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
a
taxpayer
spends
10
percent
of
his
time
in
the
home.
is
that
substantial,
do
you
think,
10
percent
of
his
working
time
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
he
spent
10
percent,
i
suppose,
but
what
do
you
consider
substantial?
20
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
30
percent
is
substantial.
and
if
someone
spends
30
percent
of
his
time
in
that
home
office
that
becomes,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
his
principal
place
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
becomes
his
principal
place
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
such
a
strange
use
of
language.
i
just
don't
know
how
you
can
leap
to
that.
it
does
say
the
principal
place
of
business,
the
principal
place
of
business
for
any
trade
or
business
of
the
taxpayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
will,
but,
you
know,
congress
cannot
write
a
bad
statute,
right?
i
mean
congress
cannot
possibly
write
a
statute
that
somehow
fails
to
accomplish
its
intent
because
if
it
does
we
will
rewrite
it
for
them?
is
that
the
theory
of
law
that
you're
arguing
on
us?
i
mean
maybe
they
did
intend
what
you're
now
telling
us,
but
the
question
is
whether
they
enacted
what
you're
now
telling
us.
and
what
they
enacted
is
the
principal
place
of
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sokolow,
one
of
the
provisions
of
280a(c)(1)
is
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
principal
place
of
business
but
it
is
sufficient
if
it
is
a
place
of
business
when
what
occurs
there
is
that
the
office
is
used
by
patients,
clients,
or
customers
in
meeting
or
dealing
with
the
taxpayer.
doesn't
that
suggest
that,
although
perhaps
you
can't
have
a
rigid
point
of
sale
or
point
of
performance
of
services
test,
nonetheless
the
point
of
sale
or
the
point
of
performing
the
services
is
of
enormous
importance
to
congress,
if
you're
talking
about
congressional
intent?
what
this
statute
says
is
even
if
it's
not
your
principal
place
of
business,
if
it's
a
place
of
business
where
you're
selling
the
goods
or
performing
the
services
we'll
allow
a
deduction
for
that.
so
doesn't
that
suggest
that
what
counsel
for
the
government
was
saying
has
some
truth
in
it,
that
it
isn't
just
adding
up
time,
that
what's
very
significant
in
following
congressional
intent
is
where
the
services
are
provided
or
where
the
goods
are
sold?
