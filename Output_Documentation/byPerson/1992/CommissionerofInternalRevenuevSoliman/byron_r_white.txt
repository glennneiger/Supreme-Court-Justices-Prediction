justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
commissioner...
the
commissioner
says
that
he
has
to
determine
where
the
principal
place
of
business
is,
but
you
just
said
that
you
have
to
compare
what
goes
on
in
the
various
places
and
how
important
they
are
and
things
like
that.
so
you
apparently
then
in
applying
the
statute
apply
the
same
test
that
the
tax
court
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what's
the
general...
they
say
they
apply
total
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
apply
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
have
the
same
general
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
you
apply
the
same
test,
and
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
a
misapplication
of
the
same
test
you
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
a
fact
finding.
that's
a
conclusion
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
think,
i
didn't
think...
i
thought
when
you
started
out
you
said
the
historical
facts
are
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
but
principal
place
of
business
is
a
legal
question.
i
thought
that's
what
you
said
at
the
outset.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
there's
no
choice.
he
doesn't
do
his
business
anywhere
else
except
his
home.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
problem
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
this
doctor
had
a
lot
of
things
in
his
car
like,
you
know,
a
computer
and
a
filing
cabinet
and
things
like
that
he
could
deduct
it,
just
like
as
if
he
rented
an
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
proposed
regulation
stay
a
proposed
regulation
forever?
it
has
been
proposed
for
quite
a
while,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
rid
of
a
proposed
regulation?
can
you
ignore
it?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
effect
it
really
isn't
a
proposed
regulation
anymore?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was.
