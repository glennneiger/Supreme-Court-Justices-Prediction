justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
just
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
possessory
rights
in
a
piece
of
personal
property
just
anywhere,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
officers
enter
an
open
field
and
run
off
with
a
mowing
machine.
do
you
think
that's
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
an
effect,
isn't
it,
and
it's
a
seizure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
if
you
seize
something
incident
to
an
invasion
of
privacy
in
the
home
or
some
other
protected
place
like
a
car,
why
the
fourth
amendment
does,
is
implicated.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
law
enforcement
officer
walks
up
to
a
person
on
the
street,
grabs
his
briefcase
out
of
his
hand
and
walks
off
with
it,
and
then
gets
a
warrant
to
open
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
had
probable
cause
to
have
it
opened.
but
you
think
just
seizing
the
briefcase
on
the
street
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it's
never
opened?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
1983
doesn't
create
any
substantive
rights
and
so
there
was
a
fourth
amendment,
was
that
the
basis
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
the
fourth
was
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course
if
the
fourth,
if
the
fourth
amendment
required
first
resort
to
state
remedies
there
wouldn't
be
a
1983
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
just,
are
you
basing
your
primary
argument
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
seizure
of
property
which
would
qualify
as
an
effect
or
as
of
a
house?
just
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
house
and
effects,
they're
all
property.
they're
all
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
indicating
there
was
any
invasion
of
privacy
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
got
thrown
out
of
their
house,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
a
fairly
egregious
invasion
of
privacy,
to
get
thrown
out
of
your
own
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
need
to
really
rely
on
just
the
fact
that
this
was
a
seizure
of
a
piece
of
property,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
strongest?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
the
seventh
circuit
say
about
that
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
thought
there
was
plenty
of
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
anyway
they
didn't
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
not
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
didn't
succeed
in
carrying
it
off
either,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
texas
against
brown
justice
stevens
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
two
interests
of
the
citizen,
the
interest
in
retaining
possession
of
property
and
the
interest
in
maintaining
personal
privacy.
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you...
excuse
me.
have
you
got
something?
horton
against
california,
that
was
something
said
by
the
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
said
the
right
to
security
and
person
and
property
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
may
be
invaded
in
quite
different
ways
by
searches
and
seizures.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
unanimous
court
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
