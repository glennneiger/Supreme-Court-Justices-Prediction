mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
county
officers
here
do
not
waive
their
state
action
argument.
on
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
conspiracy
and
dismissed
the
lawsuit
on
that
basis.
however,
we
move
onto
the
issues
that
have
been--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--they
advanced
a
number,
i
think
two
or
three
positions.
one,
they
said
that
they
would
look
at
light,
in
the
best
light
favorable
to
the
petitioners
here,
which
i
think
is
the
standard--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--that's
right.
under
one
theme
or
another
they
went,
they
assumed
there
was
state
action
and
then
went
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
is
implicated
by
the
conduct
here
and
secondly
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment,
protecting
liberty
and
privacy
interests,
was
not
implicated
by
what
occurred
here.
the--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--the
fourth
amendment's
protection
of
property?
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
we
do
not
think
the
fourth
amendment
protects
basic
property
interests.
the
katz
decision
states
that
those
interests
are
largely
to
be
left
to
the
states.
here
there
is
an
adequate
state
remedy.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
admit
that
to
put
any
type
of
ceiling
on
that
conduct
would
be
risky,
but
on
the
facts
we
have
here
where
there
is
no
prying
or
snooping,
invading
or
inspecting,
we
think
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
involved.
it
may
be
difficult
to
say--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i
think
it
was
trespass
to
gain
information
that
should
be
kept
private,
that
persons
have
a
right
to
keep
private.
if
it
were
just
merely--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
objective
acts
of
the
police
officers
or
sheriffs.
did
they
go
there
with
an
intent
to
gain
evidence
in
some
broad
sense
to
use
against
the
house
holder?
and
i
say
broad
sense,
i
mean
to
include
the
health
cases
like
camara
v.
municipal
court
and
yee
v.
seattle,
as
well
as
the
more
typical
law
enforcement
case.
but
i
think
in
each
instance
the
fourth
amendment
is
protecting
the--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i
think
that
could
be
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
if
the
government
is
following
through
on
some
interest.
the
early
fourth
amendment
cases
substantiate
that.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
that
it,
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
be
limited
to
the
strict--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--right.
but
it
should
be
viewed
more
in
the
sense
of
a
government
end
or
a
government
mission.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes,
or
any
typical
police
activity.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
we
think
this
is
like
the
cardwell
case
where
the
police
car
was
parked
on
the
public
lot
and
then
the
police
officers
took
paint
scrapings
from
it
and
used
those.
that
was
held
not
to
be
a
search
because
there
was
nothing
about
that
that
invaded
the
privacy.
no
peeking
within
it,
no
inspecting
it.
the
trailer
here
was
sitting
in
plain
view.
it
was
moved.
no
officer
looked
inside
it
or
attempted
to
introduce
anything
into
evidence
in
any
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
no,
they...
it
was
moved
temporarily
and
given
back
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
the
trailer
park
people
put
a
hook
on
it
with
a
tractor,
moved
it
off
on
its
wheels
to
a
nearby
lot
where
it
was
kept
safe.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
if
you
adopt
the
theory
of
the
seventh
circuit
it
was
temporarily
in
their
possession,
but
turned
over
again
to
the
plaintiffs,
unlike--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--i
think
you
could,
using
the
common
meaning
of
words
it
was
a
temporary
seizure.
but
what,
we
do
not
believe
it
was
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
because
it
doesn't
implicate
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
also
believe
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
handed
down
on
substantive
due
process.
there
is
nothing
about
this
activity
that
was
fulfilling
any
illinois
policy,
and
we
think
the
case
cited
by
petition,
moore
v.
the
city
of
east
cleveland,
is
far
from
the
situation
here.
illinois
had
an
adequate
remedy
for
this.
in
its
forcible
detainer
and
entry
act,
an
eviction
that
goes
ahead
without
a
proper
court
order
can
be
the
subject
of
a
damage
action.
that
remedy
was
always
available,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
we
would
ask
this
honorable
court
to
affirm
the
conviction.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
i
think
we
do.
we
would
say
that
it
should
be--
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
--yes.
we
contend
it
should
be
limited
to
privacy
interests
and
to
liberty
interests
such
as
those
involved
in
united
states
v.
place.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
horton
against
california
was
the
search
where
they
were,
the
search
warrant
said
rings
and
they
also
took
guns.
mr.
kenneth
l.
gillis
yes,
we
agree
with
that.
but
that,
the
question
is
whether
that
involves
cases
where
things
are
moved
and
implicating
just
the
property
or
possessory
interest
rather
than
the
typical
motives
behind
the
fourth
amendment.
