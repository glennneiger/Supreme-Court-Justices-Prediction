justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you're
making
the
law
turn
just
on
the
technicality
of
pleading.
you
create
a
gaping
hole
in
parratt
because
it's
just
how
you
allege
the
violation,
and
parratt
becomes
pretty
much
a
dead
letter,
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
the
procedural
violation
is
necessarily
hypothesized
on
some
substantive
constitutional
violation
having
occurred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit's
analysis
on
the
takings
issue?
was
this
a
taking
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
pleading
was
confined
to
the
fourth
amendment
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
pled
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
of
property,
didn't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
pled
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
of
property,
didn't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
a
taking
in
violation
of
the
takings
clause
be
a
substantive
due
process
violation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
government
demolishes
a
house
and
puts
a
public
school
on
it,
but
without
compensating,
is
that
a
seizure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you
would
have
to
proceed
in
that
order.
why
don't
you
ask,
why
can't
we
ask
first
whether
or
not
it's
a
taking,
indicating
that
takings
are
usually
exclusive
of
seizures,
particularly
because
it's
not
for
a
law
enforcement
or
investigative
purpose?
it's
to
exercise
the
rights
that
an
owner
generally
exercises,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
what's
happening
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
take
this
case
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
sheriff
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
trailer
park
owner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
this
had
been
a
state
run
trailer
park
and
the
sheriff
had
wrongfully
evicted
and
removed
the
trailer
pad
wouldn't
you
say
that
that
was
a
taking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
does
it
have
to--
--it's
fair
to
say
then
that
you
neither
pled
below
nor
contend
here
that
there
was
a
taking?
