sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
we
address
that
question
here
in
answer
to
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
in
this
instance
does
give
your
client
a
civil
damages
action
for
the
trespass,
i
assume?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
could
have
filed
that
claim.
and
why
didn't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
action
of
the
officers
was
basically
random
and
unauthorized
in
the
sense
the
court
talked
about
in
parratt
or
williamson
county?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
perhaps
then
that's
all
the
process
that
is
due.
