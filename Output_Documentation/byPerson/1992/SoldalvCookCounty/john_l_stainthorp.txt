mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
protects
the
law
abiding
against
unreasonable
seizure
of
their
home
and
effects
by
state
officers.
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
the
enactment
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
historical
events
that
gave
rise
to
its
enactment
over
200
years
ago,
if
we
look
at
the
text
of
the
amendment
itself,
and
if
we
look
at
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
fourth
amendment,
then
the
answer
is
unequivocally
yes,
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
in
situations
such
as
my
clients'
and
a
seizure
unaccompanied
by
a
search
must
nevertheless
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment's
command
that
it
be
reasonable.
the
seventh
circuit
decision
from
which
this
petition
for
certiorari
is
taken
is
therefore
wrong
in
saying
first
of
all
that
the
law
enforcement
context
of
the
case
is
relevant
in
terms
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies,
and
also
is
wrong
in
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
possessory
interests
of
persons,
and
also
is
wrong
in
saying
that
the
fourth,
that
the
privacy
rights
of
my
clients
in
this
particular
situation
were
not
violated.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
the
fourth
amendment
would
protect
possessory
rights
in
the
type
of
property
which
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
yes,
that
would
be
my
contention.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
i
think
if
that
is
a
seizure--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--if
it
is
a
seizure,
if
it
is
an
effect,
and
if
in
fact
that
seizure
is
unreasonable,
then
it
would
apply.
and
this
court
has
held
that
it
would
apply
in
that
situation
in
cases
such
as
g.m.
leasing
where
there
was
a
seizure
of
cars
that
were
on
the
public
street
yet
nevertheless
that
was
analyzed
as
a
possible
fourth
amendment
violation,
conceptually
no
different
than
the
case
that
you
are
proposing
here.
if
you
look
at
jacobsen,
united
states
against
jacobsen,
there
you
had
seizure
of
a,
what
turned
out
to
be
cocaine,
an
effect,
and
yet
that
was
again
analyzed
as
a
possible
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
but
the
point
of
those
places
was
that
there
was
no
invasion
of
privacy.
in
fact
in
jacobsen
the
court
only
got
to
the
possible
invasion
of
possessory
rights
after
concluding
that
there
was
no
invasion
of
privacy
because
of
the
involvement
of,
in
that
case
of
the
private
parties
and
for
various
other
reasons.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
even
if
it
is
never
opened
because
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
protect
possessory
rights
as
well
as
in
addition
to
privacy
rights.
in
many
cases
those
two
types
of
rights
are
intertwined,
as
i
submit
they
clearly
were
in
this
particular
situation.
but
a
mere
violation
or
a
sole
violation
of
possessory
rights
brings
the
fourth
amendment
into
play.
if
that
is
not
so
then
the
whole
line
of
cases
of
this
court
which
are
known
as
the
plain
view
seizure
cases
make
no
sense.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
i
think
that's
not
accurate,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
because
the
g.m.
leasing
case,
which
was
a
seizure
for
tax
purposes,
in
that
case
by
irs
agents,
did
analyze
the
seizure
itself,
not
any
search
but
the
seizure
itself
as
a
possible
fourth
amendment
violation,
held
that
it
must
satisfy
the
command
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
it
be
reasonable
and
held
eventually
that
it
was
reasonable.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
the
g.m.
leasing
was--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--okay,
1977.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
judge,
i
don't
think
that's
true
too,
either.
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
in
fact
if
you
look
at
the
history
as
laid
out
in
the,
in
my
brief,
in
my
opening
brief
there
is
a
consistent
line
of
cases
which
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
first
of
all
is
applicable
in
a
non-criminal
context
and
is--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--well,
most--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--and
for
that
reason
i
have
not
brought
a
procedural
due
process
claim
before
this
court,
and
it
is
a
fourth
amendment
claim
that
is
before
this
court
and
not
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
which
is
due
process.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
correct.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
in
that
sense,
but
this
court
has
always
been
clear
that
civil
rights
actions,
there
are
basically
three
types.
there
is,
zinermon
points
out
that
there
are
actions
based
upon
a
violation
of
a
substanded
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
such
as
the
fourth
amendment,
actions
based
upon--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--yes.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
that
is
correct,
justice
souter,
yes.
but
that
issue
has
really
not
been
raised
about
whether
a
fourth
amendment
claim
is
somehow
nixed
if
the
state
were
in
fact
to
provide
some
process
for
violation
of
that
right.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
justice
o'connor,
i
really
think
you
have
addressed
it
at
great
length
in
any
number
of
cases,
from
monroe
against
pape
to
more
recently
zinermon
against
burch.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
that
is
correct.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
i
didn't
because
under
section
1983
the
congress
has
very
clearly,
in
my
view,
given
me
a
federal
remedy
for
this
type
of
action.
i
therefore
choose
to
have
this
federal
remedy.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
in
terms
of
it
not
being
pursuant
to
an
established
state
procedure?
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes.
yes,
that
is
correct.
in
fact
there
is
a
state
procedure--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--if
i
were
bringing
a
procedural
due
process
claim
that
would
be
true.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
it
doesn't
at
all,
justice
kennedy,
and
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
have
construed
parratt,
for
instance
if
you
look
at
daniels
against
williams,
where
the
prisoner
slipped
and
fell,
that
clearly
would
not,
which
was
dismissed
on
parratt
grounds,
that
clearly
would
not
be
a
fourth
amendment
case.
there
was
no
seizure
that
occurred
in
that
case.
in
the
limited
number
of
cases
in
which
a
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment
has
occurred
the
existence
of
the
possibility
of
state
process
has
always
been
held
to
be
irrelevant
and
should
be
irrelevant
because
the
fourth
amendment
itself
does
not
concentrate
on
the
process.
the
fourth
amendment
itself
concentrates
on
the
seizure
or
the
search
itself.
if
that
seizure
or
search
is
termed
unreasonable,
then
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
does
not
create
gaping
holes
in
the
parratt
line
of
cases,
which
is
a
very
precise
holding
in
those
cases
which
is
that
when
there
is
a
procedural
due
process
case
if
the
state
gives
post
deprivation
process
then
in
several
instances
that
is
all
that
you
are
entitled
to.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
under
a
procedural
due
process
claim
you
would
obviously
have
to
show
some
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
or
property.
that
is
certainly
true.
but
when
you're
dealing
with
the
much
narrower
question
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation
which
deals
only
with
searches
and
seizures
and
deals
only
with
searches
and
seizures
of
a
small
category
of
things,
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects,
when
you
are
dealing
with
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
you,
that
you
first
file
in
state
court
and
find
that
you
have
no
remedy
in
state
court
or
that
your
federal
remedy
is
diminished
by
the
existence
of
state
remedies.
and
indeed
it
really
makes
no
sense
that
that
should
be
so.
the
fourth
amendment
itself
has
no
provision
which
in
itself
provides
for
there
must
be
process.
the
fourth
amendment
looks
to
a
seizure.
it
doesn't
look
to
process.
and
it
looks
to
whether
that
seizure
or
search
is
reasonable.
so...
and
then
if
you
look
at
section
1983,
through
which
obviously
i
am
seeking
to
vindicate
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
my
client,
that
also
has
no
provision
that
it
is
applicable
only
in
the
absence
of
a
state
remedy.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes
it
was,
chief
justice.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
monroe
v.
pape
was,
my
understanding
of
monroe
v.
pape
was
that
it
was
they
were
alleging
a
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
that
is
correct,
chief
justice.
so
certainly
with
respect
to
the,
yes,
the
interpretation
of
1983,
there
is
no
such
provision.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
monroe
v.
pape
i
think
alleged
both
fourth
and
fourteenth,
although
i'm
not
going
to
swear
to
that.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yeah.
as
it
is
here.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
that,
for
all
practical
effects
that
would
be
true
because
in
a
vast
majority
of
situations
where
you
have
violations
of
civil
rights
that
also
does
amount
in
some
sense
to
a
violation
of
state
law.
so
yeah,
if
you
had
that
provision
in
1983
that
it
was
only
operative
if
there
was
no
state
remedy,
first
of
all
i
would
expect
to
find
that
in
the
wording
of
section
1983
and
it
just
isn't
there,
and
secondly
that
would
mean
that
the
vast
majority
of
section
1983
cases
would
not
be,
you
could
not
litigate
them
with
section
1983
cases.
but
this
court
has
really
consistently
held
that
that
just
is
not
the
provision,
as
the
chief
justice
recognizes.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
okay.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes,
i
understand
the
distinction
that
you're
making
there.
if
however
you
look
at
the
parratt,
the
daniels,
that
line
of
cases,
zinermon
against
burch,
the
court
has
been
quite
clear
that
there
is,
for
a
fourth
amendment
violation
the
existence
of
possible
state
remedies
is
generally
irrelevant.
and
once
more
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
because
how
can
a
state
statute
authorize
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
how
can
a,
the
existence
of
a
state
statute
make
retrospectively
a
constitutional
violation
okay?
it
can't.
the
only--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--well,
they
cut
against
that
argument
in
a
procedural
due
process
case,
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
set
forth
that
in
such
a
case
post
deprivation
process
may
be
all
the
process
to
which
a
person
is
due.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
that's
correct.
but
there's
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
that
case,
where
you
are
attacking
the
process
and
whether
or
not
you
are
given
process,
and
this
case,
where
you
are
attacking
the
seizure
itself
of
a
home,
a
home
which
comes
within
the
express
wording
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
is
given
heightened
protection
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
no.
house.
it's
house
and
effect,
but
i
think--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes.
there
was
an
invasion
of
privacy
if
you
view
privacy
as
broader
than
secrecy,
which
this
court
has
historically
done.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
that's
right.
and
their
lives
were
disrupted,
they
couldn't--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--it
always
seemed
to
me,
justice
white,
that
it
was.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
i
don't
need
to
rely
on
that
but
i
think
i
have
an
extremely
strong
case
based
upon
that
also.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
i
would
say
they're
both
extremely
strong.
but
i
certainly
rely
upon
the
invasion
of
privacy
in
here
in
disrupting
these
people's
lives,
preventing
them
from
living
their
everyday
lives,
making
them
go
live
somewhere
else--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--it
said
there
was
not
an
invasion
of
privacy
here,
that
this
type
of
activity
did
not
invade
the
privacy
because
it
didn't
invade
my
clients'
secrecy.
and
there's
no
question,
i'm
not
saying
that
anyone
looked
into
the
trailer
home
or
did
this
as
part
of
an
investigation.
that
is
not
part
of
my
case.
i'm
quite
clear
that
this
was
an
invasion
of
privacy
because
it
disrupted
their
life,
because
it
prevented
them
from
pursuing
their
lawful
activities.
and
certainly
this
court
has
previously
held--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--in
certain
situations--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--and
this
court
has
analyzed
and
defined
the
right
of
privacy
in
much
narrower
terms
than
that,
notably
in
united
states
against
place
where
it
held
that
the
detention
of
baggage
for
90
minutes
was
an
invasion
of
privacy
of
the
defendant
in
that
case.
so,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
any,
any
involvement
or
any
disruption
of
lawful
activities
is
an
invasion
of
privacy.
in
the
fact
situation
here,
however,
the
prior
holdings
of
this
case
and
i
would
submit
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
say
that
there
is
such
an
invasion
in
this
situation.
that
is
it's
an
extremely
grievous--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--and
they
also
say
secure.
and
they
don't
say
a
right
not
to
be
arrested,
but
they
say
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects.
and
it
is
certainly
my
contention
here
that
the
action
of
the
sheriff's
police
in
throwing
them
out
of
their
house
and
making
them
move
to
a
motel
for
several
days,
disrupting
their
life,
was
a
great
violation
of
their
right
to
be
secure.
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
that
disruption,
that
invasion
of
their
privacy
was
reasonable
or
not,
that
isn't
before
the
court
at
this
time.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
okay.
so
my
argument
obviously
then
is
that
i
come
right
down
the
middle
on
the
fourth
amendment,
that
this,
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
applies
precisely
to
this
type
of
situation,
and
that
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment...
what
was
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment?
it
wasn't
criminal
investigations
that
gave
rise
to
the
fourth
amendment.
to
a
large
extent
it
was
writs
of
assistance
and
it
was
revenue
offices
going
out
and
seizing
uncustomed
goods,
i
think
notably
cider,
and
taking
it
away.
and
as
my
reply
brief
points
out,
those
seizures
did
not
occur
in
the
context
of
an
arrest
of
the
person
involved.
so
in
fact
my
situation
here
is
very
analogous
to
the
history
that
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
the
fourth
amendment.
so
it's
not,
it's
not
some
extension
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
was
uncontemplated
by
history.
it's
not
some
extension
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
was
uncontemplated
by
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
come
right
down
the
middle
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
also
it
is
not
an
extension
in
view
of
this
court's
prior
holdings.
and
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
a
very
marked
departure
from
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
i
don't
think
it
was
a
taking
because
it...
and
certainly
i
didn't
plead
that
in
the
complaint.
i
think
it
wasn't
a
taking.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
no,
my
pleading,
my
original--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
hear.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
no,
i
don't
think
in
so
many
words.
i
pled
violations
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
alleged
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
seizure.
i
also
alleged
that
it
was
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process.
i
believe
the
original
complaint
alleged
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process,
but
that,
i
did
not
pursue
that
claim
in
light
of
this
court's--
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
--judge,
i
really
don't...
justice,
i
really
don't
feel
equipped
to
answer
that
question.
that
was
not
a
part
of
my
lawsuit
here.
it's
not
a
part
of
my
complaint
and
not
part
of
the
constitutional
violation
that
i
pled,
that
i
pursued
in
front
of
the
seventh
circuit
or
in
this
court.
the
constitutional
violations
that
i
have
pursued
are
primarily
a
fourth
amendment
seizure.
and
you
are
correct,
the
seventh
circuit
did
discuss
whether
it
was
a
takings.
it
always
appeared
to
me
that
the
problem
with
that
was
that
it
was
not
a
taking
by
government
for
its
own
purpose.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
is
that
a
seizure?
i
think
in
certain
situations
that
might
be
a
seizure,
yes.
that
certainly
could
be.
but
historically
that,
my
understanding,
has
usually
been
analyzed
as
under
the
takings
clause.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
if
there
were
a,
what
could
be
construed
as
a
seizure,
and
if
that
seizure
was
unreasonable,
yes,
i
think
it
could
be.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yeah,
well,
i
think
you
would
need
to
look
at
whether
the
taking
itself
was,
came
within
the
definition
of
a
seizure,
and
then
look
at
whether
the
seizure
was
unreasonable.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
this
is
not
a
taking
for
a
governmental
purpose.
this
shares
more
of
the
attributes
of
a
seizure
in
the
course
of
some
kind
of
law
enforcement
work
by
these
agencies.
certainly
that's
the
way
they
perceived
it.
but
the
fact
that
it
was
not...
that
is
the
way
that
the
sheriffs
perceived
it.
the
fact
that
it
was
not
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
law
enforcement
should
not
serve
to
bar
the
fourth
amendment
from
this,
and
this
particular
seizure
has
much
more
in
common
with
those,
that
type
of
activity
by
the
governmental
agency.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
correct,
judge.
justice,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
if
it...
no.
if
it
had
occurred
in
this
type
of
context,
wherein
there
was
a
towing
away
of
the
trailer,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
more
aptly
analyzed
as
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
and
fits
very
firmly
within
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
certainly
one
thing
to
look
at
would
be
whether
the
taking
was
for
the,
for
a
governmental
purpose.
like
if
the
government
was
taking
it
for
their
own
purpose
that
would
seem
to
fit
more
accurately
within
the
taking
line
of
cases.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yes,
more
the
latter.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
well,
it
does
fit
within
the
line
of
cases
that
say
that
the
non-criminal
context
of
a
seizure
is
irrelevant
to
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies,
and
also
the
fact,
as
this
court
held
in
o'connor
against
ortega,
the
non-investigatory
context
of
the
seizure
is
irrelevant
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
yeah,
then
i
am
left
with
the
distinction
that
i
drew
initially
there,
that
if
it
was
for
the
government
to
actually
do
something
with
the
trailer
or
in
some
way
convert
it
into
something
for
their
own
use,
then
it
would
appear
that
the
takings
clause
would
be
more
appropriate.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
correct.
yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
why
couldn't
it
fall
into
both?
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
no,
i
don't
concede
that
at
all.
in
fact
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
several
cases
where
this
court
has
analyzed
actions
under
several
possible
constitutional
provisions,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
could
certainly
fall
under
both.
i
had
pled
it
and
litigated
it
as
a
fourth
amendment
claim
in
that
it
appeared
to
be
very
precisely
within
that
amendment.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
have
any
time
remaining
could
i
reserve
it?
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
stainthorp
thank
you,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondents
have
now
acknowledged
that
this
was
a
seizure
which
occurred
in
this
case
but
have
held
that
it
was,
but
have
argued
to
your
honors
that
it
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
seizure.
this
is
a
wholly
unnecessary
gloss
to
put
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
type
of
gloss
which
has
never
been
placed
on
the
fourth
amendment
before,
that
some
seizures
are
fourth
amendment
seizures,
other
seizures
are
not
fourth
amendment
seizures.
and
it
will
further
complicate
a
lot
of
fourth
amendment
litigation
if
this
is
allowed,
if
this
kind
of
differentiation
is
allowed
to
continue.
clearly
the
seizure
in
this
case
did
violate
the
possessory
interests
that
this
court
has
previously
held
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
think
equally
as
clearly
violated
the
privacy
interests.
therefore
we
would
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
be
overturned
and
this
case
remanded
for
trial
on
whether
it
was
reasonable.
