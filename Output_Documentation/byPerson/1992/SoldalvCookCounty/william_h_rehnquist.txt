chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-6516,
edward
soldal
v.
cook
county,
illinois.
mr.
stainthorp.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
1977.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
monroe
v.
pape
held,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
dealt
with
a
statutory
question
basically,
not
a
constitutional
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
and
i
think
the
argument
on
the
other
side
was
that
since
there
were
state
remedies
1983
wasn't
really
apt,
and
then
the
court
said
no,
that
the
existence
of
state
remedies
doesn't
prevent
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
the
application
of
1983.
you
don't
have
to
exhaust.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
holding
in
monroe
against
pape
was
a
statutory
one.
it
said
1983,
as
i
recall,
1983
does
not
require
that
before
you
resort
to
it
you
must
resort
to
state
remedies
that
might
have
given
you
the
same
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
1983
did
not,
rather
monroe
against
pape
did
not
address
the
contours
of
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
parratt,
in
that
line
of
cases,
and
hudson
against
palmer,
tend
to
cut
against
that
argument,
perhaps
in
a
rather
limited
field.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
under
the
takings
clause
your
remedy
is
an
action
for
inverse
condemnation
usually.
i
don't
know
the
remedies
in
illinois,
but
certainly
under
the
federal
system.
under
your
theory
could
a
person
bring
a
fourth
amendment
action
to
recover
damages
for
what
is
basically
an
inverse
condemnation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
really
are
broadening
the
fourth
amendment
considerably
because
there's
a
whole
class
of
cases
where
some
agent
of
the
government
goes
out
and
purports
to
take
or
occupy
private
property
that
really
he
wasn't
authorized
to
do.
and
those
things
have
been
traditionally
recompensed
by
inverse
condemnation.
if
a
fourth
amendment
action
is
available
to
vindicate
that,
that's
a
use
of
the
fourth
amendment
we
haven't
seen
before.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
mr.
stainthorp.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gillis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gillis.
mr.
stainthorp,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stainthorp.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-6516,
soldal
versus
cook
county
illinois
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
