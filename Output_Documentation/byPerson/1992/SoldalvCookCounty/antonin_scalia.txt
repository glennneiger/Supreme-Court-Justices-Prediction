justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
that
is
so
how
do
you
explain
that
there
hasn't
been,
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
a
case
like
this
should
have
come
up
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years?
i
mean,
sheriffs
have
been
seizing
and
repossessing
goods
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic
and
we
don't
have
a
case
in
which
it
has
been
asserted
there's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
date
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
200
years.
190
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
talking
about
sheriff
seizures.
these
things
have
been
going
on
all
the
time
and
very
often
the
person
says
no,
that
property
was
wrongly
taken,
that
they
shouldn't
have
had
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
there's
a
state
remedy
and
it
seems
to
me
the
reason
has
probably
been
that
there
is
a
state
remedy
for
those
seizures.
if
they
are
wrong
you'll
get
your
money
back,
and
therefore
the
state
hasn't
taken
anything
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you,
how
does
the
fourth
amendment
apply
to
the
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
reads--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
one
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
you
are
ultimately
bringing
a
due
process
claim
before
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
somebody
stops
me
from
doing
a
lawful
activity
do
i
say
you're
invading
my
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
that,
that
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me
unless
by
privacy
you
mean
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
i
suppose,
and
then
everything
invades
the
right
of
privacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
words
of
the
first
amendment
don't
say
anything
about
invasion
of
privacy,
do
they?
they
say
search
or
seizure.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
secure
from
everything.
it
says
secure
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
this
is
a
seizure,
which
makes
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
have
to
fall
into
one
or
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
concede
that
it
cannot
fall
into
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
me
it's
one
thing
to
say
that,
as
we
have
in
katz
and
later
cases,
that
a
violation
of
privacy
constitutes
a
search
and
a
seizure,
or
a
seizure,
even
if
there
isn't
any
physical
violation
of
property
rights.
but
it's
quite
another
proposition
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
violation
of
property
rights
there
is
not
a
search
and
seizure,
that
privacy,
in
other
words
an
invasion
of
privacy
is
an
essential
condition
for
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
have
never
said
that
before,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
the
classic
english
case
challenging
general
warrants,
which
is
what
this
provision
of
our
constitution
was
all
about,
was
a
case
alleging
trespass,
a
violation
of
property
interests.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
mere
violation
of
property
interest
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
its
whole
background.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
taking
the
trailer
for
the
government
to
keep
does
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
but
taking
the
trailer
in
order
to
give
it
back
to
the,
well,
they're
taking
it
to
get
it
off
of
the
property--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
was
it
moved?
it
was
not
moved
by
mental
telepathy
or
anything.
they
seized
it
and
moved
it,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
theory
of
this
case
and
wasn't
the
theory
of
the
judgment
below
that
it
was
in
the
possession
of
the
police
officers,
that
they
took
possession
of
it
and
moved
it
out
of
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
at
least
a
temporary
seize.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
words
mean
anything
they
seized
it
and
moved
it.
