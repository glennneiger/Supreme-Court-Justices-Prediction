but
that
just
means
there's
no
constitutional
violation.
there's
no
violation
of
procedural
due
process
if
due
process
is
provided,
whether
it's
before
or
after
the
deprivation.

mr.
gillis,
could
i
give
you
an...
we
had
an
argument
this
morning
arising
out
of
a
drug
seizure
in
that
the
law
enforcement
agency
took
possession
of
a
home
that
had
been
purchased
with
the
proceeds
of,
allegedly,
of
drug
transactions.
supposing
you
had
a
yacht
sitting
in
a
harbor
that
was
just
bought
with
proceeds
of
crime
and
the
government
wanted
to
go
out
and
seize
it
to
forfeit,
and
forfeit
it.
would
you
say
there
was
a
seizure
or
not
when
they
go
on
board
and
take
over
the
boat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there
is
no
criminal
proceeding,
just
that
it's
the
proceeds
of
criminal
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
evidentiary
searches,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
this
precise
seizure
we
have
in
this
case,
to
use
the
colloquial
term
rather
than
the
constitutional
term,
had
been
for
the
purpose
of
forfeiting
the
trailer
you
would
agree
that
would
have
been
a
seizure?
