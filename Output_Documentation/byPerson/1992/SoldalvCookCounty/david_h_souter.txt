justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
what
you're
claiming
here,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you're
bringing
an
incorporation
argument,
not
a
procedure
argument.
you're
claiming
corporation
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why?
what
is,
i
guess
i'm
not
following
you
in
the
sense
of
understanding
what
your
criterion
is.
how
do
you
think
we
should
distinguish
in
a
doubtful
case
between
a
compensable
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
a
seizure
under
the
fourth?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
the
government
takes
evidence
it
is
taking
it
for
its
own
purpose.
or
do
you
mean
its
own
purpose
in
the
sense
of
as
a
property
user?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
do
then
in
this
case?
the
government
was
not
taking
it
as
a
property
user,
and
the
government
wasn't
taking
it
as
evidence
or
as
contraband
either.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
fit
neatly
in
any
category.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'll
grant
you
that,
which
gets
you
to
the
point
in
effect
of
demonstrating
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
purpose,
in
the
civil
nature
of
this
that
precludes
a
fourth
amendment
application,
but
it
doesn't
get
to
the
point
of
saying
how
do
we
distinguish
between
a
case
appropriately
brought
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
one
that
should
be
brought
under
the
fifth
for
compensation.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
its
protection
of
property?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
seizure
basically
is
a
dead
letter
unless
it's
accompanied
by
a
privacy
violation
on
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
was
no
part
of
the
old
trespass
action,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
no...
i
mean
the
intention
to
gain
information
was
not
part
of
the
cause
of
action
in
entick
and
carrington,
and
there's
no
indication
that
that
was,
that
that
policy
was
somehow
narrowed
when
the
fourth
amendment
got
adopted,
was
there?
