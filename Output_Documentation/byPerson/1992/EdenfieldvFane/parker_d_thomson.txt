mr.
parker
d.
thomson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
one
specific
narrow
prohibition
by
florida
of
the
conduct
of
florida
licensed
certified
public
accountants.
it
is
a
prohibition
imposed
by
the
legislature
by
statute,
and
by
the
state
board
of
accountancy
which
licenses
cpa's
by
rule.
the
prohibition
is
of
cold
call
solicitation
of
new
clients...
what
the
statute
and
the
rule
called
direct,
in-person,
uninvited
solicitation.
the
conduct
is
one
defined
as
solicitation
which
directly
or
implicitly
requests
an
immediate
oral
response
from
the
recipient.
we're
not
her...
involved,
of
course,
with
political
speech
or
artistic
speech,
we
are
involved
with
the
most
blatant
of
commercial
speech
implemented
through
conduct
of
the
most
confrontational.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the
definition
in
the
statute...
i
mean,
in
the
rule,
is
of
one
that
requests
an
immediate
oral
response.
i
believe,
nevertheless,
that
what
you
have
proposed
would
be
barred
because
the
presentation
would
be
direct,
in
person,
and
uninvited.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the
prohibition,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
of
a
circumstance,
that
is
an
event,
a
method
of
presentation.
it
is
not
in
any
way
to
deter
the
message.
the
message
may
be
communicated
in
writing,
on
radio,
on
television,
by
direct
mail,
in
print,
in
the
yellow
pages...
in
a
whole
variety
of
ways,
but
it
may
not
be
communicated
in
a
way
that--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--excuse
me.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
empirical
evidence,
any
more
than
that
there
is
empirical
evidence
that
was
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
the
ohralik
case
with
respect
to
lawyers
which
you
mentioned
and
where
also
there
is
a
broad-scale
prohibition
of
direct,
in...
person,
uninvited
solicitation.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
are
two
basic
reasons
that
go
to
the
two
basic
purposes
of
the
governance
of
certified
public
accountants
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
statute
with
respect
to
certified
public
accountants
says
that
the
first
purpose
is
to
assure
the
accuracy
of
audit
statements
upon
which
the
public
relies,
and
the
second
is
to
protect
the
public
from
dishonest
practitioners.
taking
the
latter
one
first,
the
communication
made
in
this
fashion
is
inherently
unregulatable.
you
simply
do
not
know
what
was
said,
the
circumstances,
the
tone,
what-have-you,
and
therefore
it
is
beyond
the
subject
of
regulation
with
respect
to
the
first,
which
is,
after
all,
the
board's
primary
concern.
it
is
with
the
attest
function,
so-called,
of
cpa's.
that
is,
those
activities
that
are
associated
with
financial
statements.
in
performing
that
function,
the
cpa
represents
the
public.
he
has
a
public
function,
because
the
financial
statements
that
he
opines
on
will
be
used
by
the
public,
and
the
public
assumes
the
accuracy
of
the
financial
statements
because
of
the
opinion
and
then
relies
on
them.
that
public
could
be
clients
themselves,
it
could
be
lenders,
it
could
be
the
securities
markets,
it
can
be
the
persons
who
purchase
and
sell
securities
on
the
security
markets,
it
can
be
government
regulatory
agencies.
it
is
in
effect
to
sanitize
that
particular
relationship
which
demands
the
independence...
the
nonadvocacy,
but
the
independence
of
the
certified
public
accountant
that
this
prohibition
is
placed,
and
it
is
not
merely
the
actual
independence
of
the
certified
public
accountant,
it
is
the
apparent
independence.
it
is
that
the
public
has
faith
and
trust
in
that
independence,
whether
in
fact
there
has
been
any
actual
impairment
of
it.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
yes.
it
is
done
through
the
florida
bar,
which
is
an
integrated
bar,
and
a
representative
of--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no...
your
honor,
i
cannot
answer
your
question
specifically,
but
i
believe
that
there
are
other...
there
are
other
of
the
so-called
learned
professions
in
which
there
are
such
prohibitions.
i
think
there
are
ones
in
respect
to
engineers.
i
cannot
give
it
to
you--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no
empirical
evidence,
your
honor.
this
prohibition,
as
the
prohibition
with
respect
to
attorneys,
antedates
this
court's
decisions,
starting
with
the
virginia
pharmacy
decision
and
bates,
and
so
forth,
by
many,
many
years,
and
that
is
the
case
of...
that
is
the
case
of
attorneys,
it's
the
case
of
accountants,
and
it
would
be
the
case
of
all
other
professionals
with
which
there
were
similar
prohibitions.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
specific
provision
of
the
florida
statute
governing
certified
public
accountants,
chapter
473
of
the
florida
statute.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
might
say,
your
honor,
that
the
prohibition
in
the
statute
is
of
direct,
in-person,
uninvited
solicitation.
the
spin
put
on
it
of
demanding
an
immediate
response
is
by
rule
of
the
board
of
public
accountants.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the
statute
and--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--the
rules...
everything.
they
were
both
declared
unconstitutional
and
the
state
board
was
enjoined
from
enforcing
them.
we
submit--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i'm
clear
that
it
was
added.
it
was
a
construct
of
the
state
board
as
to
how
it
interpreted
direct,
uninvited,
in-person
solicitation.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
oh,
yes,
it
is
an
authoritative
interpretation
in
that
the
state
board
is
authorized
to
adopt
rules
to
carry
forward
the
legislative
mandate.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
i
believe,
as
i
said,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
stands
on
its
own,
but
it
has
been
interpreted
by
an
administrative
agency
that
has
the
power
to
interpret
it.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
a
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
simply
struck
it
all.
it
elided
the
two.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
i
believe
the
whole
ball
of
wax
clearly
is
at
issue.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
statute
has
been
stricken
as
to
all
of
its
applications
with
one...
with
one
caveat,
and
that
is
that
the
end
line
of
the
decision
of
the
federal
district
court
was
that
what
should
be
in
the
business
context.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
that
is
the
district
court,
and
its
determination
was
affirmed.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
asking
you
to
save
the
entire
statute
under
the
constitution.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
then
we
would
be
asking
you
to
save
whatever
could
be
saved.
in
fact,
the
statute
itself
has
a
what
you
might
call
an
unzipper
clause.
it
says
that
the...
essentially
it
says
that
it's
to
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
the
first
amendment,
and
it
is
to
be
limited
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
need
for
it.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
gives
the
board,
in
fact,
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the...
factually,
any
cpa
may
attest.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
clearly,
there
are
some
cpa's
that
do
not
attest.
how
many--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--of
course,
your
honor.
the
statute
covers
any
person
who
performs
accounting
functions
as
a
cpa,
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
to
the
layman
the
difference
between
attest
and
performing
accounting
functions
as
a
cpa
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
now,
in
terms
of
the
ultimate...
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
use
of
financial
statements,
to
be
sure,
attest
has
a
very
significant
difference,
and
it
is
the
ultimate
protection
of
the
attest
function
that
is
one
of,
or
the
most
principal
requirements
and
concerns
of
the
statute.
but
in
fact
a
cpa
is
a
person
who
performs
accounting
functions
as
a
cpa...
compilations,
and
so
forth...
and
when
you
go
to
the
small
business
that
mr.
fane
says
that
he
wishes
to
secure,
corporate
and
commercial
clients
that
have
sufficiently
complex
accounting
and
taxation
needs
to
justify
the
retention
of
a
highly
skilled
accountant,
the
difference
between
an
attest
function
and
a
compilation
function
or
something
else
that
is
accounting
services,
i
suggest
is
a
distinction
that
the
average
layman
is
not
likely
to
understand.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--well,
it's
unlikely
that
any
florida
statute
can
get
rid
of
united
states
supreme
court's
overbreadth
doctrine,
but
historically
the
statute
came
about...
it
was
actually
part
of
the
rewriting
of
the
law
in
1979,
at
a
time
when
bates
had
been
decided,
ohralik
had
been
decided,
primus
had
been
decided.
my
suspicion,
although
there
is
no
clear
legislative
history,
of
the
words,
except
to
the
extent
that
such
solicitation
constitutes
the
exercise
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
as
determined
by
the
rules
of
the
board,
was
designed
to
pick
up
issues
like
primus
in
case
there
were
some
kind
of
semipolitical
speech
rather
than
the
uncontrovertible
commercial
speech
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
going
back
to
bates,
it
was
said
that
it
did
not.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
there
are
a
series
of
cases--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--that
is
my
assumption,
your
honor,
although
this
court
has
in
recent
years
utilized
the
term.
in
some
circumstances
that
might
apply.
however,
i
do
believe
that
the
cases
have
said
it
does
not.
we
submit
that
solicitation
is
a
form
of
advertising
with
two
aspects,
the
message
that
is
conveyed,
and
the
medium
in
which
that
message
is
conveyed.
the
message
of
the
solicitation
is
the
commercial
speech.
it
is
a
message
that
proposes
a
commercial
transaction.
the
medium
in
which
the
message
is
conveyed
is
not
the
message.
there
are
many
media
through
which
the
commercial
message
here
can
be
conveyed...
as
i
said,
print
press,
newspapers
or
magazines,
electronic
press,
radio
or
tv,
direct
mailings,
laser
letters...
but
it
cannot
be
done
in
one
specific
form,
and
that
is,
uninvited,
in-person
solicitation.
each
medium
has
its
own
unique
features.
however,
all
print
media
permit
review
of
the
message
except
one...
the
cold
call.
by
the
very
nature
of
the
cold
call,
the
message
that
is
delivered
by
this
form
is
not
subject
to
regulation
simply
because
it
is
not
recorded
for
review.
we
submit
that
states
have
a
substantial
interest
in
regulating
their
learned
professions
and
in
maintaining
the
highest
professional
standards.
we
submit
that
state
regulation
of
professionals
and
the
advice
professionals
give
is
qualitatively
different
than
the
regulation
of
claims
involving
standardized
products
and
services.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
it
would
pose
a
whole
set
of
different
circumstances.
you'd
have
to...
there
are
various
ways
that
you
could
define
learned
professions.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
florida
recently
has
defined
learned
profession...
or
professions,
i
should
say,
in
one...
in
one
way
that
relates
to
professional
malpractice
that
i
think
leads
us
in
part
towards
that
determination.
i
think
that
there
are
other
thoughts
that
are
involved
that
also
impact...
what
the
florida
court
referred
to
as
licensing,
specialized
knowledge,
and
academic
preparation
of
at
least
a
4-year
degree.
you
could
incorporate
into
that
academic
preparation
training,
and
impart
continuing
education
training
that
is
required
of
such
professions
as
accounting.
you
may
also
desire
to
include
a
code
of
ethics
with
a
disciplinary
system
with
respect
to
members
who
breach
that
code.
one
criteria
that
has
been
offered
at
times
is
that
a
primary
emphasis
of
the
profession
involved
is
on
social
responsibility
over
individual
gains
with
respect
to
the
accountants,
their
public
function,
and
one
definition,
or
one
restriction
that
could
clearly
be
looked
at,
is
where
the
legislature
has
chosen
to
apply
a
privilege
to
the
communications
between
the
users
of
that
service
and
the
service
itself,
which
would
be
true
of
accountants
and
attorneys.
we
are
not
suggesting,
however,
that
it
would
apply
beyond
the
learned
professions,
and
specifically,
of
course,
we
are
suggesting
that
it
should
apply
specifically
to
certified
public
accountants.
i
would--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--at
this
point
of
time,
your
honor,
yes...
that
is,
that
the
board
has
authoritatively
determined
the
meaning
of
the
prohibition.
whether
they
did
it
for
the
reasons
that
they
were
attempting
to
constitute,
or
determine
what
constituted
the
exercise
of
constitutionally
protected
speech,
is
certainly
not
evident
in
anything
that
is
clear
from
the
adoption
of
the
rule.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
it
is
my
understanding
that
mr.
fane
challenged
the
rule,
and
whether
he
violated
the
rule
in
the
meantime
is
unknown
to
the
board.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
he
doesn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
this
court...
this
case
is
posed,
and
it
went
on
a
summary
judgment,
as
i
believe
your
honor
knows,
and
we
know
from
that
what
mr.
fane
wants
to
do.
mr.
fane
wants
to
offer
his
services
at
rates
below
the
prevailing
market
rate
for
cpa's
in
the
community,
and
he
wants
to
develop
a
clientele
of
small
to
midsized
businesses.
he
wants
to
explain
why
he
can
offer
superior
service
to
clients
as
compared
with
other
cpa's
or
accountants,
and
gives
some
reasons.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
that
is...
that
is
how
the
rule
is
interpreted
by
the
board,
without
question.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
unquestionably,
your
honor,
and
it
was
submitted
on
the
basis
of
three
affidavits,
two
by
mr.
fane
and
one
by
louis
dooner,
who
dealt
with--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i
don't
believe
i
could
respond
to
the
latter
part
of
your--
[laughter]
i
can
respond
to
the
former
part,
that
if
mr.
fane
had
wanted
to
know
whether
any
specific
conduct
that
he
wished
to
engage
in
would
or
would
not
be
permitted
by
the
board,
he
could
simply
have
asked
the
board.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
normally
you
may
not.
certainly
you
do
not
in
the
area
of
political
or
artistic
speech,
but
it
may
be
that
this
board
has
endorsed
many
times
with
respect
to
advertising
regulatory
requirements,
or
suggested
that
they
might,
whereby
the
advertising
is
required
to
be
submitted,
and
of
course
most
bar
associations
have
exactly
that,
in
which
there
is
a
prior
submission
for
clearance,
and
the
state
board
of
accountancy
permits
that.
they
have
counsel.
counsel
can
give
informal
opinions,
and
if
counsel
decides
that
it
has
not
been
determined
under
the
rules
of
the
board,
it
can
submit
it
to
the
board
for
final
determination.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
no,
your
honor,
they
didn't
say
that.
mr.
fane
was
the
one,
and
he
didn't
say
what
he
wished
to
do
with
respect
to
that.
he
said
he
wanted
to
make...
he
wanted
to
make
direct,
in-person
solicitations,
and
he
thought
that
that
was
the
most
effective
way
to
sell
his
message.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the
board
wasn't
ever
asked.
the
board
was
sued.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
as
it's
been
definitively
interpreted.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
you--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--no,
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
are
two
very
different
things.
as
to
whether
it
has
been
applied
is
a
factual
determination.
as
to
whether
it
has
been
construed,
and
therefore
to
that
extent
and
to
the
extent
permitted,
amended,
you
would
be
looking
still
at
the
statute
as
it
was
on

mr.
parker
d.
thomson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
simply
wanted
to
say
that
the
rule
says
a
communication
which
directly
or
implicitly
requests
an
immediate
oral
response
from
the
recipient--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--i
am
reading...
it
is...
it
is
an
appendix
to
our
brief--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--on
a-15.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
a-15...
a-15,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
at
the
very
top
of
the
page:
for
purposes
of
this
rule,
the
term
direct,
in-person,
uninvited
solicitation
shall
be
deemed
and
construed
to
mean
any
communication
which
directly
or
implicitly
requests
an
immediate
oral
response
from
the
recipient.
the
dooner--
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
what
i
started
to
say
is,
i
do
not
want
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
board
is
going
to
look...
would
look
favorably
on
a
request
because
it
is
their
assumption
that
it
would
implicitly
respond.
they
did
not
intend,
i
believe,
to
rewrite
the
statute
as
was...
to
gut
the
statute,
which
is
what
was
the
suggestion,
perhaps,
by
some
of
the
questions
that
were
previously
asked.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
correct.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
did
not
want
in
any
way
to
be...
to
suggest
that
the
court
is
going
to
look
favorably
on
a
request
with
respect
to
this
matter.
it
is
the
assumption
that
normally
when
that
type
of
solicitation
is
made
that
a
response
is
at
least
implicitly
called
for,
and
i
do
not
want
to
suggest
to
the
contrary.
mr.
dooner's
affidavit
was
before
the
court,
mr.
dooner
said
what
he
did,
and
that
is
in
fact
the
way
it
went
forward
for
determination
by
the
federal
district
judge
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
your
honor,
i
believe,
reading
the
two
sentences
together,
that
there
is
an
assumption
that
when
such
a
call
is
made
that
it
implicitly...
at
least
implicitly
requests
a
response.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
absolutely
if
no
response...
the
question
was
asked
to
me
before,
what
if
i
don't
want
your
response?
that
was
the
question
to
which
i
responded,
in
which
it
was
specifically
negated,
but
i
do
say...
believe
if
the
person
makes
a
cold
call
and
says
nothing,
he
expects
a
response.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
well,
certainly,
as
the
words
of
the
statute...
as
i
said
before,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
board
attempted
to
gut
the
statute
with
this
rule.
mr.
parker
d.
thomson
the
state's
interest
is
dual.
with
respect
to
the
attest
function,
it
is
to
assure
the
independence,
and
the
apparent
independence
of
the
certified
public
accountant
which
the
board
submits
is
contrary
to
the
advocacy
function
that
would
be
involved
in
this
kind
of...
this
kind
of
solicitation.
the
second
is
to
prevent,
because
of
the
unregulatability
of
this,
to
establish
a
prophylactic
rule
that
would
protect
against
overreaching
and
other
misconduct.
