justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated
this
case
is
called
edenfield
versus
fane.
mr.
scott
fane
is
a
certified
public
accountant.
he
formally
practiced
in
new
jersey
where
he
had
a
successful
practice.
in
1985,
he
moved
to
florida
and
he
wanted
to
live
there
and
start
his
accounting
practice
there.
he
intended
to
follow
the
same
working
pattern
that
he
had
had
in
new
jersey.
he
built
his
practice
in
new
jersey
by
soliciting
business
clients.
he
would
call
them
by
telephone
and
try
to
arrange
a
meeting
and
if
he
get
arranged
a
face-to-face
meeting,
he
would
explain
the
skills
the
he
had
and
how
he
might
be
a
particular
assistant
to
the
business.
but
he
could
not
do
that
in
florida.
florida
had
an
anti-solicitation
ban
imposed
by
florida
law.
the
ban
prohibited
accountants
from
in
face
or
personal
solicitation.
and
so
it
was
--
mr.
fane,
brought
this
suit
in
the
federal
courts
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this
restriction.
he
challenged
it
on
the
basis
that
when
he
was
engaging
in
his
speech,
he
was
seeking
to
communicate
truthful
and
non-deceptive
information
about
a
lawful
transaction.
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
although
this
is
called
commercial
speech,
it
is
still
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
we
have
said
that
this
commercial
speech
has
considerable
value
in
the
opinion
of
today.
they
say
that
the
commercial
market
place
like
others
fears
of
our
social
and
cultural
life
by
the
form
or
ideas
and
information
flash.
and
some
of
the
ideas
and
information
are
vital
and
some
are
little
worth.
but
the
general
rule
is
that
the
speaker
and
the
audience
not
the
government
assess
the
value
of
the
information
presented.
and
so,
even
if
a
communication
that
there
is
no
more
than
proposed
the
commercial
transaction
is
entitled
to
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
state
when
you
have
commercial
speech,
can
impose
reasonable
regulations
respecting
it.
here,
the
estate
advances
various
interests,
its
principal
argument
is
that
preventing
in
person
solicitation,
avoids
fraud
and
over-reaching,
avoid
circumstances
in
which
accountants
are
might
be
tempted
to
say
that
they
would
certify
financial
statements
falsely.
now,
we
find
for
the
reasons
that
we
expressed
in
the
opinion
today
that
this
justifications
and
others
offered
by
the
estate
are
not
advanced
in
any
direct
or
material
way
by
this
solicitation
ban.
and
so,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
regulation
in
the
context
here,
in
the
business
context
that
fane
posits
cannot
be
applied
to
him.
it
is
lawful
speech
that
is
being
suppressed
by
the
constitution
and
this
violates
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
we
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
