mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
out
by
describing
what
this
case
really
was
about,
and
what
the
injunction
that
was
added
in
this
case
provides.
no
federal
court
has
declared
this
statute
unconstitutional.
rather,
the
district
court
entered
a
narrow
injunction
which
appears
on
page
88
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
enjoins
the
board
of
accountancy
in
the
state
of
florida
from
enforcing
the
regulation
barring
in-person
solicitation,
quote,
as
it
is
applied
to
cpa's
who
seek
clients
through
in-person,
direct,
uninvited
solicitation
in
the
business
context.
the
district
court
tried
to
enter
a
narrow
injunction
directed
towards
the
regulation.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
right,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
though--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--if
you
look
at
the
affidavit
mr.
fane
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
which
he
explained
precisely
what
he
wanted
to
do,
it
is
quite
clear
that
he
had
no
intention
of
demanding
an
immediate
response.
rather,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--the
word
impliedly
in
the
regulations,
your
honor,
as
we
understand
it,
has
always
been
read
by
the
board
to
apply
to
the
situation
in
which
mr.
fane
wanted
to
engage
in
solicitation,
just
as
the
chief
justice
described
earlier.
that
is,
what
mr.
fane
wanted
to
do...
and
this
is
laid
out
in
the
joint
appendix
between
pages
13
and
14...
is
call
the
chief
financial
officers
of
small
to
midsize
businesses
and
say
in
essence,
i'm
new
in
town,
do
you
have
any
interest
in
meeting
me
so
we
can
discuss
the
services
that
i
offer?
if
the
phone
conversation
ended
with
a
no,
mr.
fane
would
have
not
pursued
it.
if
he
was
invited
to
make
a
presentation,
mr.
fane
would
go
to
the
office,
the
business,
and
explain
the
services
he
can
rendered
his
qualifications,
his
experience,
discuss
the
business
needs
of
the
client
and
his
ability
to
meet
those
needs.
at
that
point,
he
says
on
page
13
and
14
of
his
affidavit,
the
cpa
also
understands
that
most
businesses
will
not
hire
a
new
cpa
without
checking
his
or
her
references
extensively.
after
all,
the
decision
to
hire
a
new
cpa
is
not
made
lightly.
cpa's
are
privy
to
all
of
the
business'
financial
records,
and
as
a
result,
know
a
great
deal
about
the
business'
strengths
and
weaknesses.
truly,
what
mr.
fane
is
saying
is
that
he
cannot
conceivably
demand
an
immediate
response.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
because
until
this
morning,
your
honor,
the
board
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
the
word
implicitly
in
its
regulations
applies
to
the
situation
that
mr.
fane
has
described.
that
is,
mr.
fane
describes
the
service
he
can
offer
and
somehow,
under
the
board's
reading
of
the
regulation,
that
is
an
implicit
request
for
an
immediate
response.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
we
laid
this
affidavit
out
and
we've
made
our
concerns
known
throughout
the
course
of
this
litigation,
and
the
board
has
always
said
that
that
conduct
would
be
proscribed.
that's
the
theory
under
which
this
case
has
been
litigated
throughout.
we
even--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--the
board
has
said
that
any
contact
between
a
cpa
and
someone
who
is
not
yet
a
client
poses
the
fear
that
there
will
be
an
abuse
in
the
solicitation
process,
or
that
it
will
impair
the
public's
perception
as
to
the
integrity
of
financial
statements,
and
therefore
the
board
has
taken
the
position
throughout
this
litigation
that
any
direct
face-to-face
or
telephone
encounter
between
a
cpa
and
someone
who
is
not
already
a
client
is
proscribed
by
its
regulation.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
i
can
document
it
only
in
the
sense
that
when
we
put
in
mr.
fane's
affidavit,
which
describes
in
detail
what
conduct
he
intends
to
engage
in,
the
board
offered
no
response.
the
board
didn't
say,
we
agree
with
you
that
that
conduct
would
be
permissible.
to
the
contrary,
they
said
that
conduct
and
any
conduct
like
it
would
be
impermissible.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
in
all
of
their
pleadings
throughout
this
case,
your
honor.
the
first
mention
of
mr.
thomson's
theory
came
10
minutes
ago.
we've
not
heard
a
word
about
it
prior
to--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--this
point.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
your
honor,
i
think
as
one
of
the
other
justices
points
out,
if
that
were
the
board's
reading
of
its
regulations
in
the
statute,
then
it
would
apply
to
virtually
no
cpa
solicitation.
cpa's
are
not
like
lawyers
in
the
sense
that
they're
seeking
one--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--a
one
time,
one
shot
arrangement
with
the
client.
what
mr.
fane
wants,
and
what
he
said
in
his
complaint,
what
he
said
in
both
of
his
affidavits,
he
wants
to
establish
a
long-term
professional
relationship
with
a
client
that
has
some
need
for
reasonably
sophisticated
cpa
services.
and
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
asked
mr.
thomson
before,
abusive
solicitation
practices
are
not
likely
to
be
favorably
received,
and
for
that
reason
the
state
has
been
unable
to
point
to
any
evidence
from
florida
or
from
any
of
the
jurisdictions
that
have
long
permitted
solicitation
by
cpa's
that
there's
a
problem
with
abusive
solicitation.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
i
don't
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
opinion
ends
on
page
103
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor,
until
this
morning
that
issue--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--has
not
been
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor,
this
case
has
been
litigated
now
for
4
years.
we
made
quite
clear
at
the
outset
of
this
litigation,
before
mr.
dooner's
affidavit
was
submitted,
precisely
the
conduct
mr.
fane
sought
to
engage
in.
there
has
been
never
any
suggestion
that
that
conduct
would
be
permissible
under
the
regulations
that
the
board
in
fact--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor,
we've
always
understood
the
board's
position
to
be
that
any
unsupervised
conduct,
nonpublic
conduct,
or
the
contact
between
a
cpa
and
someone
who
is
not
yet
a
client
of
that
cpa,
to
implicitly
call
for
an
immediate
response.
that
is,
we've
always
understood
the
position,
and
indeed,
i
think
that's
the
only--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--it's
certainly
the
way--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--and
that
has
always
been
the
position
of
the
board
until
this
morning.
i'd
like
to
get
to
responding
to
the
first
justification
the
board
has
offered
in
defense
of
this
all-out
ban,
which
is
that
a
ban
on
solicitation
is
needed
to
preserve
the
sanctity
of
the
attest
function.
there
are
several
points
i'd
like
to
make.
first
is,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
ban
furthers
or
substantially
furthers
the
state
interest
in
preserving
the
attest
function.
while
florida
has
had
a
statutory
ban
on
in-person
solicitation
since
1969,
many
other
states
have
no
ban
on
in-person
solicitation
by
cpa's,
and
there
is
no
evidence
from
any
of
those
jurisdictions
that
it
presents
a
problem.
many
federal
regulatory
agencies,
most
notably
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
depend
very
heavily
on
audited
financial
statements
from
publicly
held
corporations.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
justice
o'connor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
he
is...
we
didn't--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
yes--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--but
not
against
the
whole
statute.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that's
the
case.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
there
may
be,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
believe
the
court
has.
the
injunction
that
has
been
entered
applies
only
in
the
business
context.
secondly,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
we--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--only
to
solicitation
in
the
business
context.
it
doesn't
apply
to
cpa's
who
want
to
solicit
individuals
for
their
personal
accounting
needs.
in
further
response,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
we
assume
that
what
the
district
court
judge
meant,
and
defendants
have
not
sought
clarification
of
it,
was
that
mr.
fane
would
be
allowed
to
solicit
the
business
entities
that
he
wants
to
solicit...
corporations
or
other
commercial
entities...
in
distinction
to
what
the
board
claimed
was
one
of
its
fears,
which
was
that
cpa's
would
solicit
unsophisticated
individuals,
and
so
the
district
court's
injunction
is
limited
to
the
business
context.
which,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
gets
me
back
to
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
we
didn't
label
this
as
a
facial,
or
as
an
as-applied
challenge.
i
think
if
you
look
at
our
complaint,
it
is
more
clearly
an
as-applied
challenge,
because
in
our
complaint,
we
specify
precisely
the
conduct
in
which
mr.
fane
seeks
to
engage,
and
we
certainly
pushed
the
district
court
towards
issuing
an
order
that
was
limited
towards
solicitation
in
the
business
context,
or
business
clients.
and
in
that
respect
i
think
the
complaint
is
very
much
like
the
kind
of
challenge
that
was
described
by
this
court
in
fox,
which
is
a
narrow
tailoring
challenge.
that
is,
the
kind
of
challenge
that
doesn't
apply...
doesn't
seek
to
have
the
statute
struck
down
as
facially
overbroad,
but
challenges
one
particular
application
to
that
statute,
and
here,
it's
for
the
kind
of
business
solicitation
that
mr.
fane
seeks
to
engage
in.
we
didn't
label
the
complaint
that
way,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
think
that's
the
only
fair
reading
of
the
complaint,
and
certainly
that's
the
way
it
was
treated
by
the
district
court
judge.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
let
me
trace
the
history
of
the
aicpa's
regulations.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
it's
very
brief,
your
honor.
at
present,
there
is
no
prohibition
enforced
by
the
aicpa
with
respect
to
in-person
solicitation.
this
rule
has
its
genesis
in
the
first
code
of
ethics
issued
by
the
aicpa
in
1917.
that
code
prohibited
encroachment,
not
solicitation.
essentially,
the
prohibition
was
for
one
cpa
soliciting
the
clients
of
another
cpa
who
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
organization.
it
did
not
forbid
general
solicitation.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
encroachment,
or
referred
to
otherwise
as
poaching,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
also
called
unfriendly.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
prohibition
remained
in
force
until
1948,
when
the
aicpa
sweepingly
amended
its
rules
to
prohibit
all
kinds
of
promotional
activity...
advertising,
solicitation
and
everything
of
the
sort.
in
1973,
the
justice
department
antitrust
division
first
contacted
the
aicpa
to
explain
that
it
thought
the
rules
were
anticompetitive
and
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws.
finally,
in
1979,
threatened
with
imminent
litigation
by
the
justice
department,
the
aicpa
withdrew
its
solicitation
ban
and
issued
a
report
called
the
report
on
solicitation,
which
is
contained
in
the
joint
appendix,
which
takes
the
position
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
in-person
solicitation
by
cpa's
leads
to
either
of
the
concerns
the
state
claims
to
fear.
that
is,
abuse
of
the
attest
function,
or
overreaching
by
cpa's
who
engage
in
solicitation,
and
the
aicpa
report
on
solicitation
is
really
the
only
comprehensive
or
authoritative
study
on
this
issue
uncovered
by
either
party.
in
fact,
it
was
submitted
by
the
defendants
in
the
district
court.
let
me
just
take
one
last
attempt
to
respond
to
the
chief
justice's
concerns
about
the
reading
of
the
regulation.
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
precisely
the
conduct
we
wanted
to
engage
in,
and
in
paragraph
13
of
our
complaint,
which
appears
at
joint
appendix
page
number
4,
we
say
that
mr.
fane,
quote...
i'm
quoting
now...
mr.
fane
brings
this
action
because
florida's
prohibition
on
in-person,
direct,
uninvited
solicitation,
including
initial
telephone
calls,
denies
him
the
opportunity
to
communicate
this
and
similar
information,
so
on.
in
the
answer,
the
defendant
denied
that
allegation--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--and
it
seems
to
me
the
denial
is
inconsistent
with
the
narrower
reading
that--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
position
that
mr.
thomson
has
espoused
was
not
put
forward
in
any
of
the
other
submissions,
particularly
the
brief
of
the
defendant,
which--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
sir,
i
would
agree.
let
me
return,
though,
to
the
state's
justifications
here.
the
other
point
i'd
make
is,
not
only
is
there
no
evidence,
but
there
is
experience
before
other
jurisdictions
that
shows
that
there
have
not
been
problems
with
solicitation
activities
by
cpa's,
nor
has
there
been
any
evidence
from
florida
during
the
2
years
that
this
injunction
has
been
in
effect
that
there
have
been
any
problems
with
abusive
solicitation.
the
defendants
never
sought
a
stay
of
the
district
court's
order.
solicitation
at
least
in
the
business
context
has
therefore
been
permissible
in
florida
for
the
last
2
years.
there
has
been
no
suggestion
at
all
that
that
has
given
rise
to
any
problems
or
any
difficulties.
i'd
like
to
say
briefly
a
word
about
the
time-place-manner
doctrine
argument
that
the
defendants
have
made
as
well.
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
why
we
do
not
believe
the
time-place-manner
argument
applies,
and
let
me
just
highlight
two
of
our
most
fundamental
concerns.
the
first
is,
there's
no
question
in
our
view
that
this
is
a
content-based
ban.
like
all
restraints
on
commercial
speech,
the
solicitation
ban
picks
out
the
particular
form
of
communication
and
regulates
it,
and
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
made
clear
that
content-based
regulations
are
not
subject
to
review
under
the
time-place-manner
doctrine.
in
the
commercial
speech
area,
we
submit
they
are
reviewable
under
the
central
hudson
test
which
we
believes
govern,
and
indeed,
all
of
this
court's
prior
cases
involving
lawyer
advertising,
professional
advertising
regulation,
had
been
decided
under
the
central
hudson
test,
not
under
the
time-place-manner
doctrine.
the
second
point
that
we
think
is
pertinent
is
that
the
defendant's
argument
really
seems
to
make
a
fortress
out
of
the
dictionary
by
equating
the
word
manner
with
mode.
here,
this
regulation
seeks
to
suppress
an
entire
mode
of
communication,
and
this
court's
opinions
by
and
large
have
said
that
where
the
regulation
completely
prohibits
a
particular
mode
of
expressive
activity,
it
ought
not
to
be
judged
under
the
time-place-manner
standard.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no,
your
honor,
i
would
still
say
that
that
was
a
content-based
restraint
in
that
he
could
say,
i'd
like
you
to
consider
hiring
me,
i'm
extremely
well
qualified,
here
are
the
services
i
render
and
the
fees
i
charge,
but
he
couldn't
say,
and
please
let
me
know
soon.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
he
couldn't
say,
let
me...
all
right,
that's
fine.
i
accept
your
amendment...
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
content-based
restriction.
that
is,
you
can
say
everything
but
those
four
magic
words.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
restriction
would
have
to
be
judged
under
the
commercial
speech
test,
and
it
would
either
rise
or
fall
on
whether
it
passed
muster
under
central
hudson.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
restraint
would
have
far
more
appeal
than
the
restraint
that
the
board
throughout
this
litigation
says
it
intends
to
impose.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
reasons.
one
is--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--there
is--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--there's
an
interrorum
effect.
the
uncertainty
would
chill
mr.
fane's
speech.
if
mr.
fane
couldn't
go
to
the
court
to
get
a
resolution
of
whether
his
conduct
was
permissible
or
not,
mr.
fane
and
probably
many
other
cpa's
would
sit
on
the
sidelines.
and
let
me
point
out,
your
honor,
this
isn't
the
only
case
that
was
brought
to
challenge
this
restraint.
there
is
another
case
that
is
now
pending
in
the
florida
state
courts
that
preceded
mr.
fane's
case,
during
which
the
board
has
taken
what
we
thought
was
the
board's
unequivocal
position
in
this
case,
which
is
that
any
unsupervised
contact
either
on
the
phone
or
face-to-face
between
a
cpa
and
someone
who
is
not
that
person's
client
is
forbidden
under
the
florida
rules,
and
so
this
is
not
a
case,
at
least
in
our
minds,
as
to
which
there
is
any
uncertainty
at
all
as
to
the
board's
position.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no.
in
fact,
they
have
vigorously,
vigorously
litigated
this
case
at
every
turn,
even
though
we
have...
we
put
it
in
our
complaint,
we
put
it
in
our
affidavits,
we
have
always
clearly
explained
precisely
the
kind
of
conduct
in
which
mr.
fane
seeks
to
engage.
unless
there
are
further
questions--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--no.
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
he
would
charge
rates
below
the
prevailing
rate
in
the
community,
but
that
was
never
a
central
feature
in
our--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--oh,
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
[laughter]
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
unless
there
are
any
further
questions--
