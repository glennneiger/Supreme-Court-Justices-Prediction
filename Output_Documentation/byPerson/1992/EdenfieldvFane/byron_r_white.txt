justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
legislature
command
this
sort
of
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
board--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
was
declared
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
make
much
of
the
immediate
response
business,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
other
than
that
let
me...
well,
it's
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
cpa's
in
your
state
that
don't
attest.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think...
but
the
statute
covers
them
as
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
regulatory
interpretation
was
authoritative,
the
courts
should
not
have
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
and
furthermore,
i
can't
imagine
why
the...
i
would...
i
can't
imagine
why
the
board
would
purport
to
limit
the
statute
to
solicitations
that
demanded
an
immediate
answer,
unless
they
never
wanted
to
enforce
the
statute
at
all,
because
i
can't
imagine
anybody
trying
to
get
a
client
would
ever
say...
you'd
never
catch
anybody
doing
that.
you
wouldn't
even
can't
imagine
that
anybody
would
do
that.
so
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
board
is...
they're
just...
they
just
said,
but
we
just
don't
want
to
enforce
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
banned
something
besides
direct
solicitations,
something
besides
those
that
demanded
an
immediate
response.
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
the
district
court...
neither
mr.
fane
nor
the
district
court
accepted
the
regulation
as
a
definitive
construction
of
the
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional,
broadly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
it
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
it
didn't...
it
didn't
stop
to
fool
around
with
notions
about
demanding
an
immediate
response.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
present
position
of
the
organization
representing
cpa's,
the
american
institute
of
cpa's?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
present
position
of
that
institute?
do
they
have
a
rule
against
in-person
solicitation
now,
or
did
they
ever,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
go
through
the
whole
thing.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
also
called
unfriendly.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
we
at
least
prefer
to
wait
until
the
board
goes
after
somebody
so
we
know
what...
know
for
sure
what
the
florida
prohibition
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
it
all
right
for
us
to
prefer
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't...
when...
this
has
already
been
remarked
upon.
when
you
filed
your
complaint
and
said
what
he
wanted
to
do,
the
board
didn't
say
go
ahead
and
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
the
state's
interest
is
in
doing
that?
