chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1594,
fred
edenfield
v.
scott
fane.
mr.
thomson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
empirical
evidence
that
shows
this
sort
of
a
request
was
made
frequently?
the
reason
i
ask,
it
seems
to
me,
judging
from
my
practice
as
a
lawyer,
not
as
an
accountant,
in
trying
to
put
it
in
present-day
terms,
it
seems
to
me
if
i
were
trying
to
get
a
client
and
had
a
presentation
to
make
i
wouldn't
demand
that
the
person
make
an
immediate
response.
you're
trying
to
kind
of
ingratiate
yourself
with
the
person,
not
imprison
them
verbally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not...
that
wasn't
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was,
did
the
state
of
florida
or
agency
have
some
sort
of
empirical
evidence
before
it
that
this
sort
of
request,
with
a
request
for
an
immediate
answer,
was
common
or
prevalent
among
accountants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
agency
advance
any
particular
reason
why
it
selected
this
kind
of
conduct,
if
there
were
no
empirical
evidence
why
it
picked
out
this
demand
for
an
immediate
response?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
save
as
much
of
the
statute
as
can
be
saved
under
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
entire
statute
couldn't
be
saved
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
any
of
the
affiants
who
joined
mr.
fane,
or
did
mr.
fane
himself,
say
that
they
wanted
to
make
solicitations
and
demand
immediate
responses
from
the
solicitees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
would
think
the
board's
answer
would
be,
go
ahead,
so
long
as
you
don't
demand
an
immediate
response.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what's
this
lawsuit
about?
the
board
says
it
wants
to
impose
this
requirement
only
on
people
who
demand
an
immediate
response.
you
say
that's
the
last
thing
your
client
would
have
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that
view
of
the
board?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
has
the
board
manifested
to
you
its
view
that
this
conduct
would
be
proscribed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
document
your
statement
that
the
board
has
taken
this
position
that
you
describe
throughout
this
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
said
that
in
a
pleading
somewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
you
don't
think
the
board
ever
qualified
the
statute
the
way
mr.
thomson
says
it
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
shot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
mr.
vladeck,
in
the
petitioner's
brief
they
refer
to
the
affidavit
of
louis
w.
dooner,
cpa,
in
his
response
to
fane's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
page
7
of
the
petitioner's
brief--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
they
quote
from
dooner's
affidavit.
it
says,
the
only
type
of
solicitation
that
a
cpa
may
not
engage
in
is
that
that
places
the
potential
client
in
the
position
of
having
to
make
an
immediate
oral
response.
if
that's
a
fair
statement,
i
don't
think
your
earlier
statement
is
fair
that
it
had
never
been
suggested
before
that
this
was
the
interpretation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
according
to
them,
the
dooner
affidavit
was
filed
in
opposition--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
your
motion
for
summary...
at
least
you
knew
then
that
this
was
a
position
that
the
board
was
taking,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
is
consistent
with
what
you
said
moment
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
called
encroachment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
i
would
have...
but
if
you
place
the
way
things
develop
in
a
trial
in
the
time
sequence,
i
take
it
first
you
get
the
complaint,
then
the
answer,
then
you
get
motions
for
summary
judgment,
and
i
think
the
affidavit
i
was
quoting
from
in
the
petitioner's
brief
was
at
the
summary
judgment
stage--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
you
accept
the
positions
to
be
refined
over
the
complaint
and
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
certainly
was
put
forward
in
that
affidavit--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vladeck,
supposing
that
you
were
in
complete
agreement
with
mr.
thomson
that
the
only
way
the
board
sought
to...
and
the
only
kind
of
conversation
the
board
sought
to
prohibit
was
those
demanding
an
immediate
answer,
would
you
still
say
that
that
was
not
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation,
if
he
could
communicate
everything
he
wanted
to
but
couldn't
demand
an
immediate
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
couldn't
say,
let
me
know
right
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
vladeck.
mr.
thomson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a-15
to
the
blue
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
whereabouts
on
a-15?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
telling
us
that
this
regulation
was
duly
enacted
by
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
second
sentence
that
justice
stevens
just
referred
to
does
say
uninvited,
in-person
visits
or
conversations
or
telephone
calls
to
a
specific
potential
client
are
prohibited.
now,
does
that
mean
ones
that
demand
immediate
oral
response,
or
just
across-the-board
they're
prohibited?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
no
such
response
is
requested
by
the
caller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thomson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1594,
edenfield
against
fane
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
