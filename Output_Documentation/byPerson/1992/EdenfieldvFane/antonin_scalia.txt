justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
us
to
consider
the
statute
as
containing
that
additional
qualification,
or
do
you
think
that
was
sort
of
just
added
by
the
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
an
authoritative
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
should
regard
the
statute,
then,
as
meaning
that,
as
requiring
an
immediate
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
you
want
us
to
interpret
that
statute
for
purposes
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
thomson,
can
i
come
back
to
what
you
call
the...
what
the
unzipper
feature
of
the
stat...
we
do
have
an
overbreadth
doctrine
in
first
amendment
cases
which
says
that
if
the
statute
is
valid
in
some
applications
but
not
invalid
in
others,
it's
invalid
in
toto.
can
that
doctrine
be
overruled
by
simply
saying
in
the
statute,
by
the
way,
to
the
extent
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
it's
no
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
a
stroke
of
the
pen
do
away
with
our
overbreadth
doctrine?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
thomson,
is
it
possible
to
have
a
facial
attack
on
a
statute
which
interprets
the
statute
according
to
a
regulation?
i
mean,
once
you
say
you're
going
to
interpret
it
according
to
the
regulation,
it's
no
longer
a
facial
attack,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--sure,
i
guess
you
can
have
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
as
it's
been
applied
as
well,
but
i
wouldn't
consider
that
a
facial
attack.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
whole
notion
of
a
facial
attack
was
that
you
have
not
given
the
state
an
opportunity
to
elaborate
upon
the
statute
through
its
judicial
decisions
or
through
its
regulations,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
that.
thank
you,
mr.
thomson.
mr.
vladeck.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
justice
antonin
scalia
will
you
explain
that
again?
i
don't
understand.
what
is,
in
the
business
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
unfair
and
destructive
business
practices.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
thomson,
that
the
whole
purpose
of
that
which
directly
or
implicitly
requests
an
immediate
oral
response
is
simply
to
distinguish
the
situation
described
in
the
last
sentence,
indirect
forms
of...
such
as
giving
speeches.
when
you
give
a
speech,
you
don't
expect
somebody
in
the
audience
to
get
up
and
say,
oh,
that
sounds
pretty
good
to
me,
can
you
give
me
a
little
more--
[laughter]
isn't
that
the
only
purpose
of
it,
really,
and
that
they're
really
saying
you
cannot
make
person-to-person
oral
contact?
