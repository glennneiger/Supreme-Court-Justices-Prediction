mr.
thomson,
may
i
just
interrupt
on
this
one
question?
you...
in
your
brief
you
do
the
same
thing,
you
talk
about
it
calls
for
an
immediate
response.
would
it
also
be
prohibited...
your
rule
also
apply
to
a
solicitation
by
an
accountant
who
did
not
ask
for
an
immediate
response,
if
he
just
said
i...
went
in
and
made
the
presentation
and
said,
think
it
over
and
whenever
you're
interested,
let
me
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
raise
any
question
that...
they
held
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional,
the
entire
rule
unconstitutional,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
make
any
argument
that
they
should
have
tried
to
save
possible
applications
of
the
statute
to
extreme
cases
of
overreaching
or
anything
like
that,
or
do
you
say
the
whole
ball
of
wax
is
at
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it's
conceivable
that
some
applications
of
the
rule
might
be
entirely
legitimate
even
under
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning,
if
the
accountant
went
and
engaged
in
the
very
extreme
kind
of
behavior
that
was
in
ohralik,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
thomson?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
statute
says
it's...
to
the
extent
that
such
solicitation
constitutes
the
exercise
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
as
determined
by
the
rules
of
the
board,
and
then
the
rules
of
the
board
define
direct,
in-person,
uninvited
solicitation
as
those
that
directly
or
implicitly
request
an
immediate,
oral
response
from
the
recipient.
does
that
mean
that,
under
your
understanding
of
the
rules
construing
the
statute,
that
if
the
oral
solicitation
did
not
request
an
immediate
response,
it
would
not
be
prohibited
by
the
statute
because
the
rules
have
construed
the
statute
to
limit
them
in
this
fashion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
that
your
adversary
ever
engaged
in
the
kind
of
solicitation
as
defined
in
the
rule,
where
he
demanded
an
immediate
response?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
asserts
an
interest
in
engaging
in
solicitations
that
do
demand
an
immediate
response,
that's
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
wonder
if
he
has
standing
to
bring
this
lawsuit,
is
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
which
he's
permitted
to
do
under
the
rule,
as
long
as
he
doesn't
demand
an
immediate
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
normally
we
don't
require
people
to
say,
can
i
have
permission
to
make
this
speech,
before
they
make
a
speech.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
give
you
a
little
further
help.
that's
certainly
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
understood
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
that
in
florida,
in-person
solicitation
by
cpa's
is
forbidden,
period.
that's
the
way
they
construed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
say
anything
at
all
about
the
rates
he
proposed
to
charge
as
compared
with
the
prevailing
rates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
never
defended
on
the
ground
that
they
have
an
interest
in
preventing
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a-15
of
the
blue
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
the
next
sentence
in
the
regulation
makes
that
rather
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
uninvited,
in-person
visits,
and
so
forth,
are
prohibited.
