mr.
thomson,
does
florida
have
the
same
prohibition
on
the
books
with
regard
to
attorneys?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
any
other
profession
in
florida?
is
it
just
these
two,
cpa's
and
lawyers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
no
evidence
was
offered
that
the
in-person
solicitation
gave
rise
to
overreaching
or
deception
or
anything
of
that
kind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
thomson,
do
you
think
that
the
overbreadth
doctrine
applies
to
commercial
speech
regulations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
are
other
cases
that
say
the
same
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
take
it
that
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
not
applicable
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
that
florida
could
have
the
same
kind
of
regulation
for
real
estate
brokers...
no
cold
calls?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
thomson,
in
any
event,
this
suit
was
brought
as
a
facial
attack
against
the
entire
florida
statute
in
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
you
brought
what
appears
to
be
a
broad
sort
of
facial
attack
on
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
had
not
been
applied
to
mr.
fane,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
had
not
engaged
in
conduct
and
been
disciplined
for
it.
he
brought
this
in
advance,
this
attack,
against
the
whole
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
overbreadth
doctrine
applies
to
commercial
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
are
any
possible,
legitimate
applications
of
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
how
can
the
court
just
strike
the
whole
thing
down?
