mr.
harold
m.
streicher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
here
have
created
confusion
where
there
is
none.
the
plain
language
of
subsection
(o)
of
207
is
clear
and
it
does
not
require
going
to
extrinsic
sources
at
all,
and
this
is
where
the
petitioners
have
created
their
confusion.
the
word
agreement
is
the
subject
of
both
subpart
1
and
subpart
2
of
section
207,
subsection
(o)(2)(a).
and
with
that
understood
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
clear,
and
no
part
of
subsection
(o)
is
rendered
superfluous.
the
plain
meaning
of
paragraph
2
is
that
a
public
agency
may
provide
compensatory
time
only
pursuant
to,
one,
an
agreement
between
the
public
agency
and
representative
of
the
employees,
or,
two,
pursuant
to
an
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
and
i
note
that
in
harris
county
this
is
exactly
what
has
occurred,
as
each
harris
county
employee,
as
each
one
of
the
petitioners
has
stepped
up
to
accept
employment
they
have
signed
this
individual
form
that
mr.
leibig
mentioned
and
have
agreed
to
the
terms.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question,
and
that
is
one
of
my
points,
that
one
would
need
to
go
to
that
particular
state's
law
to
determine
under
which
section
one
can
meet.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
it
would,
there
being
no
agreement
in
justice
o'connor's
scenario,
then
under
subpart
(i),
then
one
would
go,
one
would
be
authorized
to
go
to
subpart
2.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
believe
then,
justice
scalia--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--that
i,
if
i
understood
mrs.
o'connor's
question
correctly
then,
if
there
is
no
agreement
under
subpart
(i),
then
one
would
be
authorized
to
go
to
subpart
2.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
if
one
focuses
on
the
words
of
this
particular
statute
and
focuses
on
the
subject
of
subpart
1,
that
being
is
there
an
agreement
reached
between
a
representative
and
the
employer,
there
be...
if
there
is
no
such
agreement
then
one
would
go
to
subpart
2.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
perhaps
don't
understand
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
but
if
there
is
no
agreement
reached
between
the
representative
in
those
states
that
recognize
a
representative,
and
that
one
can
meet
and
confer
with
that
representative,
then
one
would
go
to
subpart
2.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
one
would
have
to
go
to
the
state
law
to
determine
the
result
of
that
answer,
and
in
texas,
as
we
have
stated
in
our
reply
brief
and
our
appendix,
in
texas
we
cannot
recognize
a
representative.
it
is
against
public
policy.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
no.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
no.
if
in
texas,
as
we
are,
prohibited
from
entering
into
an
agreement
with
the
representative
of
employees,
then
we
would
be
authorized,
as
we
are,
to
enter
into
individual
agreement
with
the
employee.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
yes.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
if
that
was
the
effect
of
that
state's
law,
yes,
that
was
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
i'd
like
to
continue
then
on
that
particular
point
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
that
being
the
subject
of
both
part
1
and
2
is
agreement,
it
allows
the
state
laws
to
be
preserved.
and
with
all
the
various
state
laws
out
there
i
ask
how
one
can
override
this
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
i
want
to
now
turn
your
attention
to
the
background
in
which
subsection
207
arose
in
order
to
gain
a
correct
understanding
of
subsection
207.
this
court
had
just
decided
the
garcia
case
in
february
of
197...
1985,
which
extended
provisions
of
the
flsa
to
state
and
local
governments.
however,
a
great
variety
of
compensatory
time
arrangements
had
developed
between
public
employers
and
their
employees,
and
long-standing
practices
existed
concerning
the
use
of
compensatory
time
which
were
of
mutual
benefit
to
both
the
public
employee
and
the
public
employer.
this
background
of
mutually
beneficial
compensatory
time
arrangements
was
the
background
in
which
congress
passed
section
207(o).
already
by
november
of
1985
congress
had
passed
section
(o)
to
help
public
employees
and
public
employers
preserve
their
mutually
beneficial
compensatory
time
practices.
congress
was
not
for
a
minute
going
to
allow
the
full
weight
of
the
garcia
decision
to
descend
upon
the
public
employers,
be
they
state
governments
or
local
government
entities.
and
for
that
proposition
i
point
you
to
the
appendix
for
the
petition
for
writ
of
cert,
page
65a,
page
72a,
89a,
114a,
and
also
the
garcia
decision
itself
talks
about
this
background
in
which
existed
when
the
garcia
decision
was
handed
down.
properly
understood
in
light
of
this
congressional
purpose
to
preserve
existing
compensatory
time
practices,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
congress
could
have
improved
upon
the
statutory
language
that
was
actually
chosen
in
section
207(o).
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
no.
the
employer
can't,
in
those
states
that
provide
for
dealing
with
the
employees,
as
they
do
in
texas,
in
harris
county.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
no.
in
this
particular
case
all
of
the
petitioners
have
signed
individual
compensation
forms
whereby
they
accept
the--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--comp
time
arrangement
which
exists
in
the
personnel
regs
of
harris
county.
and,
by
the
way,
those
regulations
provide,
or
the
individual
agreements
provide
that
the
first
240
hours
of
compensatory
time
shall
be
placed
in
a
bank
for
the
employee,
so-called
comp
time
bank.
after
240
hours...
by
the
way,
those
hours
are
time
and
a
half
hours,
after
that
time
the
employees
receive
cash
for
each
hour
worked
at
the
rate
of
time
and
one-half.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
yes.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
believe
they
stated
that,
justice
scalia,
when
they
said
those
employees
not
covered
by
subsection
1.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
agreements.
the
subject
of
both
subpart
1
and
subpart
2
is
agreement.
it
just
cannot
be
any
clearer
than
that.
the
statement
of
the
statute,
if
we
could
reread
paragraph
2
to
gain
this
understanding,
a
public
agency
may
provide
compensatory
time
only
pursuant
to
subpart
1,
there
it
talks
about
an
agreement
between
the
public
employer
and
a
representative,
and
2,
also
the
subject
matter
is
pursuant
to
an
agreement.
there
it
happens
to
be
talking
about
an
agreement
entered
into
by
the
employer
and
the
individual
employee.
but
it
just
cannot
be
any
clearer
that
the
subject
matter
is
agreement
in
both
subparts.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
don't
believe,
justice
stevens,
that
subpart
2
could
apply
because
in
section,
subsection
(o),
subpart
(b)
it
talks
about
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
if
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement
were
one
wherein
no
compensatory
time
was
allowed,
then
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
have
been
entered
into
pursuant
to
subpart
1,
and
that
would
be
the
relationship
between
that
employer
and
those
employees.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
justice
white,
i
believe
there
is
ammunition
for
both
sides,
but
several
of
the
justices
this
afternoon
pointed
out
the
recognition
by
the
secretary
of
labor
himself
that
whether
or
not
an
employee
has
a
representative
shall
be
determined
by
state
law.
one
just
cannot
overcome
that
in
this
case,
and
it's
extremely
important
in
this
case
to
remember
that
because
under
texas
state
law
one
cannot
have--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--that's
correct.
i'm
sorry,
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
but
again,
the
end
result
is
there
must
be
an
agreement
necessarily
because
we
cannot
recognize--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--that's
correct.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
preemption,
or
i
think
then
we
have
come
into
the
gregory,
the
ashcroft
area
where
there
must
be
a
plain
statement
by
congress
to
upset
the
balance,
the
traditional
balance
between
federal
and
state
rights.
there
is
no
such
plain
statement
made
by
congress
in
this
subsection
(o).
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
certainly
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
apply,
or
of
this
court
to
apply
the
flsa
to
the
state
and
local
governments,
but
it
is
not
the
intent
of
this
court
without
a
plain
statement
by
congress
to
upset
the
traditional
relationship
between
the
rights
of
the
states
and
the
federal
rights.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
correct,
justice
souter.
although
the
chevron
case
talks
about
the
secretary
or
the
administrator
of
regulations,
but
the
gregory
case
talks
about
what
congress
can
do.
and
to
allow
the
regulations
to
have
greater...
to
have
the
chevron
case
take
precedent
over
the
gregory
case
would
allow
the
regulations
to
do
what
congress
itself
cannot
do.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
in
texas
if
the,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
the
police
and
firemen's
act,
a
election
were
held
authorizing
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement,
then
one
could
get
into
subsection
1.
and
that
of
course
is
page
3a
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
cert.
specifically
page
7a
of
that
act,
section
5,
upon
the
adoption
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
by
any
city,
town,
or
political
subdivision
in
this
state
to
which
this
act
applies
as
herein
in
this
section
provided,
fire
fighters
and/or
policemen
shall
have
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively
with
their
public
employer
as
to
wages,
hours,
working
conditions,
and
all
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
upon
the
passage
of
that
statute
and
upon
an
election
whereby
the
local
voters
adopt
specifically
this
act,
then
only,
justice
kennedy,
could
a
local
governmental
entity
in
texas
come
under
subsection
1.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
believe...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
i
believe
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
it
on
page
30a
talks
about
if
the
employees
do
not
have
a
representative
compensatory
time
may
be
used
in
lieu
of
cash
only
if
there
is
such
an
agreement
or
understanding.
but
i
wish
to
note,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
comment
on
page
34a
by
the
secretary
does
not
mean
that
he
refused
the
point
that
this
particular
governmental
entity
was
making,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
can
be
read
congruently
with
my
interpretation
that
if
the
subject
matter
of
subclause
1
is
agreement,
there
being
no
agreement
reached,
then
therefore--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--this
statute,
your
honor,
does
not
say
that,
though.
and--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
is
the
case,
justice
white.
the
states
have
been
free
to
regulate
labor
relations.
and
if
i
could
also
make
one
point
in
regard
to
the
prior
question--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--and
that
is
not
what
this
particular
subpart
(i)
speaks
of.
if
i
could
take
a
brief
moment
to
spend
on
page
31a,
that
the
regulation
states
where
employees
of
a
public
agency
do
not
have
a
recognized
or
otherwise
designated
representative.
harris
county,
nor
any
local
governmental
entity
in
texas,
can
recognize
a
designated
representative.
it
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
an
agreement
in
texas
with
a
representative
unless
the
election
that
we
previously
discussed
has
been
held.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
that's
right.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
but
not
for
the
purposes
of
subsection
(o),
to
enter
into
a
compensatory
time
agreement.
the
representative
in
texas,
as
was
previously
discussed,
can
present
grievances
and
other
concerns,
employee
concerns,
but
because
of
5451c
and
c-1,
we
cannot
meet
and
confer
with
a
union
representative
of
a
public
employee
to
enter
into--
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
--justice
stevens,
if
it
were
to
stop
there
that
may
be
true,
but
we
have
not
stopped
there.
we
do
have
individual
agreements
with
the
employees.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
harold
m.
streicher
if
i
could
take
a
moment
with
the
impact
of
the
court's
decision,
it
could
have
a
substantial
impact
not
only
on
the
respondents
but
on
all
state
and
local
governmental
entitles.
it
would
have
an
impact
in
regard
to
their
ability
to
provide
essential
services
to
the
citizens
of
those
entities,
and
i
don't,
can't
think
of
a
more
quintessential
service
to
the
people
of
a
local
government
entity
than
the
police
services.
the
current
value
of
harris
county's--
thank
you.
