mr.
michael
t.
leibig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
concern
before
the
court
today
involves
the
precise
rules
under
which
a
state
or
local
employer
may
reach
agreements
to
substitute
time
off
for
cash
overtime
with
their
employees.
it
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
207(o)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
regulations
issued
under
that
section.
it
is
important
that,
under
the
usual
rules,
to
realize
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
makes
non-cash
payment
for
overtime
work
illegal
completely.
it
always
has,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
this.
in
1937
when
president
roosevelt
first
sent
a
message
to
congress
about
the
fair
labor
standards
act
he
emphasized
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
was
to
protect
the
unorganized
and
to
establish
an
hours
of
work
rule.
it
might
seem
that
the
comp
time
rule,
or
the
cash
overtime
rule,
isn't
directly
related
to
the
overtime
rules,
but
it
is.
the
reason
cash
overtime
is
required
is
because
other
schemes
that
were
in
existence
widely
in
the
united
states
before
1937,
for
instance
paying
for
overtime
in
script
or
paying
for
overtime
in
time
off
or
comp
time
are
easily
manipulated
to
avoid
the
40-hour-a-week
work
rule.
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
itself,
prior
to
the
1985
amendments
which
adjusted
the
act
to
the
public
sector,
always
outlawed
compensatory
time
as
a
means
of
paying
for
overtime
work.
in
the
1985
amendments,
after
this
court's
decision
in
garcia,
congress
responded
a
request
from
state
and
local
governments
to
lighten
the
burdens
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
without
a
special
statute
would
place
on
state
and
local
government,
and
made
a
number
of
changes
in
the
acts
in
specific
response
to
pleas
by
state
and
local
governments
and
their
employees
that
special
adjustments
be
made
to
recognize
the
special
status
of
the
states.
the
states
were
effective
in
those
pleas,
and
section
2
of
the
1985
amendments
allowed
the
use
of
comp
time
and
also
changed
the
rules
with
regard
to
volunteers
and
a
number
of
other
rules
with
regard
to
joint
employment.
part
of
the
amendments,
section
6,
expressly
directed
the
secretary
of
labor
to
issue
regulations
interpreting
and
implementing
the
1985
amendments.
it
is
our
argument
that
section
207(o)
that
deals
with
compensatory
time
and
the
conditions
under
which
a
public
employer
may
use
compensatory
time
that
is
not
otherwise
available,
and
are
laid
out
in
207(o)(2)(a),
require
an
agreement.
and
the
issue
that
the
court
needs
to
address
today
are
the
precise
conditions
under
which
an
agreement
needs
to
be
reached.
there
are
a
couple--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--why
isn't
the
secretary
of
labor?
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
completely.
i'm
not...
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
briefs
in
this
case
were
due
almost
immediately
after
the
election
in
which
the
administration
changed.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
and
i
think
that
relates
directly
to
one
of
the
arguments
i
want
to
make
which
has
to
do
with
why
regulations,
when
there's
a
statute...
the
way
the
fair
labor
standards
act
works
generally
is
that
it's
an
administrative
act
which
is
very
dependent
on
the
regulations
not
only
for
the
use
of
comp
time
but
across
the
board.
and
one
of
the
flexibilities
in
the
act,
the
portions
of
the
act
that
are
in
regulations
are
in
the
executive
branch,
given
to
the
executive
branch
by
congress,
i
think,
partly
specifically
because
of
the
increased
flexibility
that
that
allows
over
if
they
were
in
the
statute
themselves.
and
i
think
the
increased
flexibility
has
been
demonstrated
particularly
under
the
1985
amendments.
not
only
did
congress
make
new
amendments,
but
since
then
on
issues
in
which
the
states
have
been
particularly
concerned
they
have
gone
to
the
department
of
labor
and
got
adjustments
to
the
regulations.
in
the
abshire
case,
which
is
a
ninth
circuit
case
dealing
with
who
is
exempt
and
who
is
not,
that
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
and
the
court
denied
cert.
but
at
the
same
time
state
and
local
governments
went
to
the
department
of
labor
and
the
department
of
labor
changed
the
rules
with
regard
to
exemption
specifically
to
recognize
the
special
needs
of
state
and
local
government.
and
that
shows
one
of
the
reasons
that
it's
wise
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
have
regulations
dealing
with
this
kind
of
an
issue.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
congress
was
unmistakably
clear
that
states,
as
states,
are
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
both
section
203
of
the
act
itself,
subsections
(d)
and
(x),
and
section
207(o),
part
1,
expressly
and
clearly
leave
no
doubt
that
state
and
local
employees
are
covered.
secondly,
the
1985
amendments
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
state
function,
that
is
personnel
functions
and
the
relationship
between
personnel
functions
and
the
payment
of
overtime,
is
also
specifically
and
clearly
regulated
by
the
statute.
the
question
that
i
think
the
statute
is
ambiguous
about
is
whether
or
not...
it
is
also
clear
that
the
statute
requires
an
agreement
prior
to
an
employer
using
compensatory
time.
where
the
ambiguity
lies
is,
in
the
situation
where
the
employees
designate
a
representative
to
deal
with
the
employer,
must
an
agreement
be
reached
with
the
representative
prior
to
the
implementation
of
compensatory
time
system.
and
i
think
the--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--the
regulation
is,
but
what
is
quoted
on
page...
the
reference
to
state
law
that
is
quoted
in
the
red
brief
is
not
a
reference
to
the
regulations,
it's
a
reference
to
the
preamble
to
the
regulation.
and
that
sentence
in
the
preamble
is
put
in
the
middle
of
sentences
before
it
and
after
it
which
address
one
of
the
direct
questions
in
this
case.
the
question
asked
in
which
the
reference
to
state
law
was
made
was
in
a
state
that
has...
do
you
mean
that
you
on
need
an
agreement
in
states
which
have
collective
bargaining.
and
the
preamble
says
no,
we
didn't
mean
that,
our
regulations
don't
say
that,
but
we
do
believe
that
to
determine
who
the
representative
is
in
a
given
state
there
may
be
a
reference
to
state
law.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
think
there
are
two
questions
there,
your
honor.
the
first
is
the
difference
between
the
senate
and
the
house
report.
if
i
could
hold
that
a
minute
i
will
comment
on
that.
the
other
question
a
whether
you
look
for
state
law,
i
do
think
you
look
to
state
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
representative,
but
when
you
look
to
state
law
you
do
not
look
merely
to
state
collective
bargaining
law.
in
other
words
you're
not
just
looking
to
state
law
to
see
whether
or
not
there's
a
collective
bargaining
statute
or
not.
if
you
were,
the
wording
in
the
statute
would
be
much
simpler
than
it
is
now.
it
would
not
refer
to
all
the
things
other
than
collective
bargaining,
which
even
little
(i)(1)
refers
to.
so
that
you
do
look
to
state
law,
but
you
look
for
such
things
as
if
there
is
state
law
providing
for
collective
bargaining,
then
state
law
requires
exclusive
representation
and
requires
that
unilateral
changes
can't
be
made
on
any
wage-hour
working
condition
without
dealing
with
that
representative.
that
model,
the
national
labor
relations
model,
exists
in
less
than
25
states,
and
even
in
those
states
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
models
in
place
for
different
types
of
employees.
most
states
have
different
types
of
models
ranging
from
a
meet
and
confer
model,
where
you
have
to
meet
but
you
don't
have
to
agree,
to
having
a
situation
in
texas
where
there's
a
texas
state
statute
that
says
employees
can
have
a
representative,
but
the
representatives
don't
have
the
rights
to
collective
bargaining
agreements.
so
that
i
think--
but
what
the
preamble
to
the
regulation
says,
and
i
want
to
make
clear
this
is
the
preamble
to
the
regulation,
so
you've
got
to
go
to,
it's
a
long
drive
from
the
statute
to
the
preamble,
but
the
preamble
to
the
regulations
i
think
are
trying
to
say
if
two
people
show
up
or
three
people
show
up
and
say
they're
the
representative,
you
look
to
state
law,
it
might
be
agency
law,
it
might
be
all
sorts
of
law
in
the
state.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
because
under
the
preamble,
under
that
set
reference
in
the
preamble,
which
is
the
only
reference
to
state
law
in
this
area
anyway,
if
you
read
the
whole
paragraph
it
starts
off
by
somebody
asking
exactly
that
question,
do
you
look
to
state
law
to
find
out
whether
a
collective
bargaining
representative
can
enter
in
full
agreements.
and
the
answer
that
the
department
of
labor
in
the
preamble
gave
is
no.
it's
also
the
clear
answer
in
the...
the
plain
meaning
of
the
regulations
themselves
contain
a
clear
statement
that
the
representative...
what
matters
is
the
designation
of
the
employees,
not
the
recognition
of
the
employer.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it's
easier
for...
he,
justice
souter
referred
to
the
red
brief,
but
i
think
it's
easier
if
you
have
the
petition
to
cert
appendix.
it
is
set
forth
in
pages
30a
and
32...
i'm
sorry,
that's
the
actual
regulation.
the
preamble
is
set
forth
in
33a
through
35a.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
actual
regulations
are
in
the
pages
just
before
that.
if
i
could
also
mention
the
senate
and
the
house
report
that
justice
souter
asked
about.
the
house
report
refers
to
designated
representatives,
and
the
regulation,
that
is
the
regulation
on
30a
through
32a,
adopt
pretty
much
the
house
report.
the
argument
is
made
by
the
petitioners
that
the
house
report
may
support
that,
but
what
about
the
senate
report.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
if
you
look
with
rigor
at
the
house
and
senate
report
you
will
find
that
the
actual
language
of
section
207(o)
is
the
direct
language
of
the
house
report,
not
the
senate
report.
during
the
conference
committee
this
section,
it
was
the
language
of
the
house
report
that
became
207(o)
precisely,
and
if
you
compare
it
you
will
see
what
i
mean.
i
don't
think
there
were
differences
in
the
wording
for
this
point
in
the
statutory
language,
but
the
structure
of
the
house
report
became...
therefore
you
look
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
house
report
and
not
the
senate
report
because
the
language
that
was
enacted
is
the
house
language.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
that's
right.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
if
you
look
to
gregory
v.
ashcroft
you
would
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
i
think
on
its
face
gregory
speaks
of
interfering
with
the
usual
state
and
local
functions,
and
it
does
not,
it
seems
to
refer
to
the
question
of
coverage.
the
conference
congress
has
to
be
clear
about
coverage.
i
grant
it,
not
just
coverage
of
the
states
as
states,
but
also
coverage
of
the
function
of
the
state
that
is
being
regulated.
everybody
agrees
that
this
statute
regulates
the
use
of
comp
time
by
state
and
local
employees.
the
question
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
about
is
how
do
you
arrange
comp
time
agreements.
in
the
statute,
if
you
look
to
gregory,
congress
expressly
says
in
the
statute,
there
is
an
express
delegation
to
regulations,
and
the
regulations
do
this.
now,
the
reason
i
think...
it's
really
the
interchange
between
chevron
and
gregory,
and
how
do
you
read
those
together.
and
i
don't
think
the
court,
i
don't
think
that
there
are
precedent
i
can
cite
to
say
how
you
read
the
two
together.
i
think
that's
a
real
challenging
situation.
i
do
think,
though,
if
gregory
meant
to
abandon
chevron
we
are
launched
on
a
very
dangerous
course
because,
for
example
in
the
report
on
intergovernmental
relations
that
was
submitted
by
the
amici
it
lists
a
great
number
of
statutes,
32
statutes,
i
believe,
passed
before
1981
that
regulate
state
and
local
functions,
and
most
of
those
statutes
rely
on
regulations.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
will
not
work
without
its
regulations,
not
just
on
the
comp
time
issue,
but
it
wouldn't
work
on
many
issues,
and
congress
knew
that.
so
i
think
that's
the
first
point.
the
second
point
is
i
do
think,
and
there
has
been
a
number
of
law
review
commentary
on
the
importance
of
increased
rigor
for
chevron,
at
least
when
it
interacts
with
gregory,
but
some
would
say
generally.
to
the
degree
that
you
are
a
literalist
or
a
strict
constructionist
in
a
general
sense,
that's
strictly
looking
at
the
words
and
meanings
of
the
statutes,
then
you
should
also
be
quite
rigorous
about
chevron,
and
i
recognize
that.
therefore--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--subclause
(i)
in
the
first--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--subclause
(ii)
in
the
first
prepositional
phrase
says
in
the
case
of
employees
not
covered
by
subclause
1,
granted.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
the
problem
is
subclause
1
has
a
list
of
types
of
agreements,
not
types
of
employees.
subclause
1...
and
that's
where
the
ambiguity
lies.
i
don't
think
you
can
get
to
where
i
want
to
get
by
reading
the
statute
alone,
but
you
cannot
also
get
to
where
the
other
side
wants
to
get
by
reading
the
statute.
that's
why
it's
ambiguous.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
let's
do
that
for
a
minute.
if
you
just
read
the
terms
of
the
statute
you
get
a
situation,
as
read
by
harris
county,
you
get
a
situation
where
the
statute
would
then
say
if
you
want
an
agreement
you
need
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
memorandum
of
understanding,
any
other
form
of
agreement,
an
agreement
with
individuals,
or
an
agreement
with
individual
employees.
that
basically
covers
every
possible
type
of
agreement
you
have.
if
that's
what
this
means,
you
didn't
need
section
2(a)
at
all
because
you
could
have
just
said
the
employer
can
have
comp
time
whenever
they
want
to
because
all
they
have
to
do
is
refuse
every
agreement
and
they
are
automatically
in
a
place
where
they
can
impose,
as
harris
county
did
as
a
condition
of
employment,
comp
time.
so
if
that's
what
congress
meant,
first
of
all
they
didn't
need
any
of
these
words.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
it's
isn't
an
available
option
in
a
limited
number
of
states
in
the
united
states,
and
if
congress
wanted
to
say
that
they
could
have.
but
it
is
an
available
option
in
more
than,
for
police
employees,
for
example,
well
over
50
percent
of
total
police
employees
in
the
united
states
it
is
an
available
option.
it's
an
option
in
fact
in
this
case
harris
county
took.
they
claim
their
agreement
is
based
on
an
auditor's
report.
it's
a
form
that
you
file
when
you're
hired.
it
has
your
name,
a
bunch
of
boxes
filled
in
how
much
money
you're
going
to
get
paid,
and
then
in
little
print
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
it
says
i
accept
this
employment
and
the
conditions
and
regulations.
and
that's
what
you
sign.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
in
that
case,
though,
2
little
(i)
would
just
say
collective
bargaining
agreements,
it
wouldn't
say...
first
of
all
it
wouldn't
say
memorandum
of
understanding
in
the
normal
sense,
but
you
could
argue
about
that,
but
it
wouldn't
say
any
other
agreement
between
the
public
agency
and
representatives.
obviously
this
statute
is
not
meant
to
provide
only,
that
you
only
need
agreement
in
states
with
collective
bargaining.
i
think
you
do
need
an
agreement
in
states
with
collective
bargaining,
and
that's
why
the
preamble
to
the
regulations
makes
the
reference
to
looking
at
state
law
to
find
out
how
state
law
sets
up
rights
of
representation.
i
would
emphasize
in
texas
there
isn't
a
collective
bargaining
statute,
but
there
is
a
statute
that
says
public
employees
can
deal
with
their
employer
through
a
representative,
not
to
reach
contracts
but
to
deal
with
them
on
all
sorts
of
other
things.
and
the
actual
representative
in
this
case
regularly
represents
its
members
in
grievances
and
before
the
city
council
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
and
has
other
agreements
with
harris
county
that
are
enforced
regularly.
it
has
a
dues
check
off
agreement.
it
deals
with
harris
county
all
the
time.
so
that
you're
right,
if
congress
wanted
to
say
there
is
only
two
situations,
states
with
collective
bargaining,
and
they
have
certain
special
rights,
and
states
without
collective
bargaining,
and
in
those
states
you
can
impose
this
as
a
term
and
condition
of
employment,
they
wouldn't
have
used
these
words.
more
than
that,
what
this...
these
words
are
ambiguous
is
you
look
at
them
rigorously,
and
therefore
what
these
words
meant
congress
vested
in
the
department
of
labor,
appropriately
i
would
say
even
under
a
rigorous
application
of
chevron,
to
decide,
not
in
the
courts
to
decide,
in
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
think
so,
and
i
think
the
way
you
judge
that
is
you
look
at
the
words
and
see
if
they
are
unclear,
not...
one
definition
of
ambiguity
is
two
meanings,
but
other...
the
word
ambiguity
i
think
is
also
used
to
mean
when
a,
in
this
context,
the
context
of
using
regulations,
when
a
statute
is
unclear.
but
to
decide
that--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--that
wouldn't
be
logical
for
a
number...
the
first
reason
it
wouldn't
be
logical
is
because
if
you
play
that
out
what
that
would
mean,
congress
wouldn't
have
needed
all
these
words
to
say
that.
that's
one
of
them.
the
second
reason
is
if
you
look
at
the
overall
structure
of
the
1985
amendments
that
doesn't
make
sense,
as
we
explain
in
the
brief.
but
more
importantly,
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
a
whole
it
wouldn't
make
sense
because
it
would
vest
employers
with
the
possibility
of
doing,
it
was
exactly
happened
in
texas,
that
is
completely
abrogate
the
need
for
any
agreement
at
all
because
comp
time
can
be
imposed
as
a
condition
of
employment.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no.
what
i
urge
on
you
is
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
it
could
mean,
and
it
would
be
reasonable
for
it
to
mean
what
you
described
earlier.
it
also
could
mean
that
the
people
covered
by
1
are
those
people
that
have
a
representative
and
therefore
could
xx
various
forms
of
agreement.
the
question
before
the
court
is
who
decides
which
it
means.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
if
you...
you
mean
because
it
could
only--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--whether
you're
an
employee
covered
by
little...
first
of
all
there
are
a
couple
reasons
why
i
think
you
are.
one
is
from
the
regulations.
but
let
me
make
another
point.
if
you
look...
first
of
all,
if
you
read
it
there
is
doubt
about
it.
enough
doubt
at
least,
i
would
argue,
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
both
the
senate
and
the
house
report
don't
agree...
do
agree
about
one
thing,
that
(i)
is
meant
to
apply
only
where,
in
every
case
where
there's
a
representative,
and
(ii)
only
applies
where
there
is
not
a
representative.
and
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
are
very
clear
about
that,
and
specifically
indicate
at,
in
the
senate
report
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
at
101a
and
in
the
house
report
at
36a.
so
they
both
say
the
meaning
that
i
said
is
what
it
means,
that
whether
there's
an
agreement
or
not.
another
reason
is
the
logical
course
of
it.
if
you
do
not
have...
if
(i)
only
applies
to
where
there
are
actually
agreements,
then
even
in
states
where
there
is
collective
bargaining,
if
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
designated
representative
and
the
state
and
it
didn't
deal
with
comp
time,
petitioner
would
argue
they
can
use
comp
time,
even
though
under
state
law
they
would
not
ordinarily
be
able
to
use
comp
time
because
they
would
be
changing
wage-hour
working
conditions
unilaterally.
therefore
if
that's
what
it
meant
you
would
raise
the
same
problems
that
petitioners
complain
about,
that
is
congress
imposing
on
states
that
chose
to
have
collective
bargaining
a
requirement
other
than
their
law
would
require.
so
that
the
lack
of
logic...
one
of
the
reasons
that
you
look
beyond
the
statute
is
the
lack
of
logic
of
the
other
interpretation.
now,
i
must
admit
to
get
to
the
full
brunt
of
the
lack
of
logic
you
have
to
look
at
what
is
this
all
about.
this
whole
thing
is
to
keep
states
from
using
comp
time
in
a
way
that
would
undermine
the
basic
40-hour
standard
in
the
statute,
which
it
can
easily
do.
let
me
give
you
an
example
what
happens
in
harris
county.
what
actually
happens
in
harris
county
is
an
individual
deputy
sheriff,
it's
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
the
county
needs
somebody
to
work
until
midnight,
the
individual
deputy
is
supposed
to
get
off
at
6,
the
county
can,
and
this
is
legitimate,
nobody
has
disputed
this,
can
order
them
to
stay
until
midnight,
work
6
extra
hours.
without
these
amendments
they
would
have
to
pay
for
that
in
cash,
but
congress,
in
order
to
lift
burdens
from
the
state,
said
you
can
pay
for
that
time
in
comp
time.
so
they
pay
them
in
comp
time.
he
then
has
9
hours
on
the
books
because
he
gets
6
hours
at
time
and
a
half,
he
has
9
hours
comp
time.
the
problem,
and
what
happens
in
harris
county
now
is
and
then
that
week
ends.
the
next
week,
when
you
have
unilaterally
imposed
comp
time,
every
day
the
sheriff
can
come
to
that
deputy
at
5
o'clock,
when
he's
supposed
to
work
until
6,
and
say
go
home
today
because
i've
got
to
eat
up
your
comp
time
bank.
and
therefore
they
devalue
the
comp
time.
and
there
are
other
ways
that
that
could
be
done.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right.
if,
for
example
if
he
were
paid
in
money
he
could
take
the
money
and
put
in
a
bank.
he
would
have
the
money
there.
when
you're
paid
in
comp
time,
as
senator
black,
as
hubert
black
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
1980...
38
amendment
said,
if
an
employer
pays
you
in
time
off,
then
you
can
put
the
comp
time
in
a
bank,
and
they
call
it
a
comp
time
bank.
but
unless
you
have
an
agreement
that
works
out
how
this
is
going
to
work,
and
what
actually
happened
in
harris
county,
the
employer
can
come
to
you
and
say
withdraw
the
money
from
the
bank
today,
go
home,
right
inside
your
regular
schedule.
and
that
happens.
that's
what
my
clients
are
after.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
first
of
all,
that
practice
was
condemned
by
congress
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
xx
they
outlawed
comp
time.
what
happened
in
this
statute--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--right.
they
have
reintroduced
it.
that's
my
point.
they
have
reintroduced
it,
but
reintroduced
it
by
putting
certain
restrictions
on
it.
the
reason
for
the
restrictions
is
to
open
the
window
for
state
and
local
governments
by
lightening
the
burden
a
little
bit,
or
half
way.
and
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
article
by
easterbrook
where
he
points
out
is
once
congress...
the
state
and
local
government
went
to
congress
and
said
we
want
some
relief
from
this
statute.
congress
said
get
together
with
your
employees,
and
this
is
in
the
legislative
history,
figure
out
what
kind
of
relief
you
want,
and
come
and
tell
us.
they
did.
both
people
said,
both
house
and
senate
said
little
(i)
is
what
controls.
then,
after
the
rules
were
passed,
now
state
and
local
government
wants
to
say
if
you
opened
up
the
window
a
little
bit,
you've
got
to
lift
it
all
the
way.
if
that
happens,
that
will
undermine
federalism
because
in
the
future
congress
will
not
leave
these
areas
where
they
can
regulate
to
leave
flexibility,
which
i
think
they
have
done
under
the
act.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
would
just
like
to
make
three
points.
the
first
one
deals
with
texas
law.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
statute
referred
to
by
mr.
streicher
also
says
in
section
6
that
employees
may
have
representatives
and
the
representatives
may
deal
with
issues
arising
in
the
work
place
including
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions.
i
admit
it
doesn't,
it
prohibits
having
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
it
does
allow
representation.
it's
very
important,
and
we
have
emphasized
in
our
brief
that
we
are
not
claiming,
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
require
that
there
be
a
collective
bargaining
contract
covering
comp
time.
the
only...
it
requires
a
special
new
entity
directed
by
congress
which
is
a
comp
time
agreement
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
only
consequences
of
having
an
agreement
is
that
you
can
use
comp
time.
the
only
consequences
of
violating
the
agreement
is
that
if
you
are
sued
for
cash
overtime
you
do
not
have
that
defense
which
congress
granted
you.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
well,
it's
not
a
collective--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
sense
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
ordinarily
agreements
between,
one,
between
exclusive
representatives
and
their
employees.
they
normally...
the
situation
in
which
collective
bargaining
agreements
of
the
kind
we're
talking
about
are
created
normally
prohibit
unilateral
dealings
between
employees
and
that.
this
is
different
than
that.
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out,
a
deputy
sheriff
in
texas
could
designate
his
minister
to
be
his
representative,
or
a
lawyer,
or
anybody
to
be
the
representative.
it's
only
if
they
want
a
representative
you
have
to
deal
with
the
representative.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
to
encourage
voluntariness
of
the
agreements.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
employees
can
designate
a
representative--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--even
texas
law
gives
them
the
right
to
do
that
and
recognizes
the
right
of
the
representative
to
act
for
the
employees
as
an
agent
would
act
for
the
employees.
then
they
can
enter
into
an
agreement.
once
the
agreement
is
entered--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--yes.
yes,
i
do.
once
an
agreement
is
entered,
though,
it's
very
important...
the
only
way
to
enforce
the
agreement
is
as
a
defense
against
statutory
claims
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
cash.
it's
not
enforceable
anywhere
else,
and
that's
the
only
consequence
of
the
agreement.
the
state's
courts
can
refuse
to
recognize
it
as
a
contract,
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
another
difference
is
it's
not
an
exclusive
representative
situation.
each
employee
can
designate
or
not
designate
whoever
they
want.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
right.
and
the
second
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--i
think
employees
are
covered
by,
the
employees
in
this
case
would
be
covered
by,
they
are
employees
who
do
not
have
an
agreement
and
therefore
you
cannot
use
2(i).
one
other
thing
i
just
want
to
make
clear
while
i
have
time
is
that
the
agreement
that
the
employer
is
referring
to
is
just
a
form
that
has
a
little
place
at
the
bottom
that
you
sign.
it
doesn't
mention
comp
time,
it
doesn't
mention
anything.
it
says
as
a
condition
of
employment
you're
accepting
whatever
regulations
we
have
now
or
ever
have,
and
we
can
change
them
whenever
we
want,
and
you
sign
that
to
get
your
pay
check.
it's
not
a
negotiated
agreement.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
and
the
point
of
all
this
is
the
reason
to
require
the
designation
of
a
representative
is
the
traditional
way
to
guarantee
that
agreements
are
voluntary.
if
you
have
a
representative...
as
long
as
employees
have
a
right
to
have
a
representative,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
if
they
don't
choose
to
have
a
representative
then
you
can
presume
when
they
sign
this
form
and
are
paid
in
that
way
they
were
volunteers.
if
they
do
designate
the
representative
then
you
should
have
to
deal
with
the
representative.
and
if
the
representative
on
an
individual
basis
works
out
an
agreement,
then
that
agreement
is
only
useful
for
one
purpose,
as
a
defense
against
claims
for
cash
by
the
state
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
state
can
ignore
it.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
no,
i
think
that
is
the
secretary's
position.
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
i
think
the
secretary's
position
is
you
either
have
to
have
one
of
the
kinds
of
agreements
talked
about
in
little
(i)
1--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--right.
but
the
reason
they
say
we
look
to
state
law...
states
can
say
public
employees
can
only
choose
exclusive
representatives,
and
if
they
do
they
are
regulating
the
choice
of
a
representative
not
the
arrival
at
an
agreement.
and
states
can,
and
texas
has.
texas
has
a
statute--
mr.
michael
t.
leibig
--thank
you.
