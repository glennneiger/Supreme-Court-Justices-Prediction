justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
ambiguity
solved
by
the
department
of
labor's
reg,
the
one
that,
well,
it's
set
out
on
page
28
of
the
red
brief,
that
the
question
of
whether
employees
have
a
representative
for
purposes
of
7(o)
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
state
or
local
law?
i
mean,
does
that,
is
that
the
source
of
resolving
the
ambiguity?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
also
to
be
read
by
saying
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
representative
the
purposes
of
subsection
1
you
look
to
state
law?
in
other
words
does
this
in
a
way
take
the
same
position
the,
i
think
it
was
the
senate
version
of
the
legislat
history
took?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
just
as
readily
look
to
state
law
to
determine
what
the
significance
of
the
designation
of
the
representative
is
in
states
which
do
not
allow
collective
bargaining
agreements?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
your
argument
that
the
requirement
for
plain
statement
in
effect
arises
because
otherwise
the
secretary
or
congress,
depending
on
whether
you
zero
in
on
the
reg
or
the
statute,
would
be
foisting
or
mandating
a
collective
bargaining
obligation
onto
the
states
that
they
did
not
have.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
to
that
extent
you
would
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you
can
call
it
anything
you
want
to,
but
it's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
that
subject.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
position
take
you
beyond
the
secretary's
position
in
the
regs?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
secretary
took
the
position
that
if
you
have
got
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
this
is
the
way
you
must
agree
on
this
subject.
did
he
take
the
position
that
if
you
don't
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
then
they
be
the
kind
of
agreement
that
you
speak
of
for
defensive
purposes
and
it
must
be
done
in
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
not
necessarily
a
cba.
