justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
that
indicate
the
statute
is
ambiguous?
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
and
to
me
that
makes
the
statute
ambiguous.
that
is
to
say
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
it's
silent
with
respect
to
comp
time,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
to
read
the
statute.
perhaps
you
think
it's
clear.
does
little
(i),
or
number
2,
(ii)
control?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not
clear
that
there's
such
agreement,
because
it
doesn't
talk
about
agreement,
it
talks
about
agreement
with
reference
to
compensatory
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
certainly
think
some
employers
could
argue
that
single
(i)
controls,
that
there
is
an
applicable
provision,
it
just
says
nothing
about
it.
i
think
that's
a
plausible
construction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
talking
about
two
different
things.
we're
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
the
context
of
the
hypothetical
agreement
we
have
outlined,
and
then
there's
also
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
employee
is
authorized
to
conclude
it.
but
those
are
two
separate
questions.
i
suppose
you
would
look
at...
if
you're
going
to
look
at
texas
law
for
little
(i)
as
to
whether
you
have
a
union
agreement
under
little
(i),
suppose
you
look
at
texas
law
for
little
(ii)
as
well,
right?
i
mean,
if
state
law
prohibits
individual
agreements
apart
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
authorized
union,
then
you
cannot
have
an
agreement
or
understanding
arrived
at
between
the
employer
and
employee
under
little
(ii),
right?
is
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
view
in
texas
that
a
public
employer
can
use
subclause
1
if
it
wants
to,
or
that
it
must
always
use
subclause
2?
