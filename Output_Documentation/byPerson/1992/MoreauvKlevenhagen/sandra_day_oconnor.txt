mr.
leibig,
you
argue
basically
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
we
ought
to
refer
to
a
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
case
of
gregory
against
ashcroft
in
interpreting
this
statute?
certainly
it
is
a
traditional
state
function
to
determine
whether
the
state
is
going
to
negotiate
over
overtime
and
whether
the
state
must
pay
it.
and
true,
the
statute
does
contemplate
that
states
will
be
subject
to
it,
but
perhaps
it
doesn't
contemplate
it
in
the
fashion
you
suggest.
and
if
we
look
to
gregory
against
ashcroft
we
might
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
just
look
at
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
the
absence
of
the
regulation,
doesn't
it
appear
to
say
that
if
employees
aren't
covered
by
subclause
(i)
then
an
agreement
between
the
agency
and
the
employee
will
govern,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
what
it
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
get
pretty
far
by
just
looking
at
the
terms
of
the
statute.
perhaps
the
regulation
simply
isn't
permitted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
streicher,
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
there,
in
a
state
where
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
the
agreement
does
not
allow,
it
just
doesn't
cover
comp
time,
now,
do
you
think
in
such
a
state
that
the
county
would
be
able
to
enter
an
agreement
with
employees
such
as
you
have
in
this
case?
an
individual
employee
to
cover
it?
