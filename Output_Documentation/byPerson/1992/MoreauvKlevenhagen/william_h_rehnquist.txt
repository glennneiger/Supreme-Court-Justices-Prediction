mr.
leibig,
where
is
the
preamble
set
forth?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
mean
devalue
it?
don't
give
him
enough
notice
to
make
any
use
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
that
practice
by
an
employer
was
condemned
by
congress
in
this
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
they
have
reintroduced
comp
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
leibig.
mr.
streicher.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
streicher,
there
has
been
some
colloquy
between
the
bench
and
you
and
your
opponent
about
the
provisions
of
a
regulation
and
there
has
been
reference
made
to
something
on
page
34a
of
the
appendix
that
apparently
is
the
reaction
of
the
department
of
labor
to
requests
for
comment
on
a
rule.
and
at
the
last
paragraph
on
page
34a
that
carries
over
to
35a
it
says
the
department
believes
that
the
proposed
rule
accurately
reflects
the
statutory
requirement
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
memorandum
of
understanding,
or
other
agreement
be
reached
between
the
public
agency
and
the
representative
of
the
employees
where
the
employees
have
designated.
now,
what
rule
is
that
comment
referring
to?
do
you
know?
it
seems
by
its
context
it
must
be
referring
to
a
previously
promulgated
rule
or
regulation.
is
there
a
regulation
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
it,
do
you
know?
well,
if
you
don't
know,
just
proceed,
but
it
would--

553.23,
as--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
streicher.
mr.
leibig,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
leibig.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
