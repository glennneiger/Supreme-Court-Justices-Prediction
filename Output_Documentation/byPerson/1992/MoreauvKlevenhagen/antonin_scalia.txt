justice
antonin
scalia
speaking
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
mr.
leibig,
why
isn't
he
here?
do
we
know
that
or
do
you
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
mean,
why
hasn't
the
government
expressed
any
view
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
realistically
the
employer
is
not
in
a
position
to
refuse
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
that's
pressed
upon
it.
i
mean,
you're
quite
right
that
they
could
get
there
by
simply
refusing
every
agreement,
but
realistically
that's
not
an
available
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
would
still
not
be
a
vain
act
by
congress
to
set
it
up
this
way
because
it
would
preserve
for
those
states
that
did
have
collective
bargaining
with
public
employees
under
2(a)
little
(i),
it
would
preserve
the
power
and
the
position
of
the
union
in
those
states.
you
should
be
the
last
person,
you
know,
to
criticize
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
words
can
be
ambiguous
but
there
is,
you
know,
there
is
a
scope
of
ambiguity.
red
can
mean,
you
know,
read
or
red,
but
it
can't
mean
donkey.
is
what
you're
urging
upon
us
within
the
scope
of
the
ambiguity
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
critical
phrase
is
employees
not
covered
by
subclause
(i),
and
as
you
point
out,
subclause
(i)
does
not
describe
employees
but
it
describes
agreements.
why
wouldn't
it
therefore
be
logical
to
say,
you
know,
that
it
means
employees
not
covered
by
agreements
under
subpart
(i)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
those
are
all
good
policy
reasons,
but
what
you
urge
upon
us
instead
is
that
it
means
employees
who
do
not
have
a
representative?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
see
how
yours
is
one
of
the
available
options.
i'm
not
sure
that
yours
is
within
the
scope
of
the
ambiguity.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you're
not
covered
by
little
(i).
you
are
not
an
employee
covered
by
little
(i)
simply
because
you
have
a
representative.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
don't
you
know
the
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
the
question.
is
there
an
agreement
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
is
silent?
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
answer
to
that
is
self
evident.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
i'm
talking
about
another
state
that
has
public
employee
unions
and
that
prohibits
employees
from
dealing
with
the
public
employer
apart
from
their
union.
in
such
a
state
the
employees
would
be
disabled
from
making
agreements
under
little
(ii),
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
would
be
no
agreement
or
understanding,
so
you
would
preserve,
you
would
preserve
the
exclusive
bargaining
power
of
the
authorized
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
streicher,
you
say
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
they
could
have
put
it
better?
i
can
imagine
how
they
could
have
put
it
better.
if
it
means
what
you
say
it
means
they
could
have
said
in
little
(ii),
absent
such
applicable
provisions,
comma,
an
agreement
or
understanding
arrived
at
between
the
employer
and
employee.
that's
the
meaning
you
want
to
give
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
a
much
clearer
way
to
put
it,
don't
you
think,
instead
of
in
the
case
of
employees
not
covered
by
subclause
(i)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
have
made
sense
to
me
to
say
pursuant
to
little
(i),
applicable
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
or
other
agreement,
little
2,
absent
such
applicable
provisions--
--that's
very
clear.
isn't
that
clear?
[laughter]
but
they
didn't
say
that.
do
you
take
the
provision
the
statute
refers
to
agreements
or
to
groups,
or
to
types
of
employees?
does
it
refer
to
types
of
agreements?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
in
the
statement
of
basis
and
purpose
for
the
rule,
which
says
that
the
department
believes
that
the
proposed
rule
accurately
reflects
the
statutory
requirement,
according
to
the
agency,
that
a
cba
memorandum
of
understanding
or
other
agreement
be
reached
between
the
public
agency
and
the
representative
of
the
employees
where
the
employees
have
designated
a
representative?
if
they
have
designated
a
representative,
says
this,
the
agreement
must
be
reached
with
that
representative.
preemption?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
my
goodness...
it
has
to
be
in
every
detail
of
the
scheme?
they
have
made
the
decision
to
apply
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
the
states.
that's
the
decision.
it's
clear
that
the
states
are
going
to
be
bound
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that
every
detail
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
must
moreover
be
particularly
clear
as
applied
to
the
states,
otherwise
in
every
little
section
of
the
act
you're
going
to
have
one
rule
for
the
states
and
one
rule
for
the
private
employer?
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
very
sensible.
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
is
set
forth
at
the
top
of
page
33a.
this
is
the
statement
of
basis
and
purpose.
it's
not
just
a
response
to
comments
either,
it's
the
statement
of
basis
and
purpose
that
must
be
adopted
with
the
rules.
and
it's
as
authoritative
as
the
rules
themselves.
it's
a
part
of
the
adoption
of
the
rules,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
regulation
does,
on
page
31a,
subpart
(c),
where
employees
of
a
public
agency
do
not
have
a
recognized
or
otherwise
designated
representative
the
agreement
or
understanding
concerning
compensatory
time
off
must
be
between
the
public
agency
and
the
individual
employee.
but
that's
only
the
case
where
employees
do
not
have
a
recognized
or
otherwise
designated,
or
otherwise
designated
representative.
and
that
language
at
the
bottom
of
34a
is,
as
i
understand
it,
an
explanation
of
that
same
provision.
well,
is
there
some
case
or
some
law
that
says
that
a
state
may
forbid
or
may
not
forbid
collective
agreements
between
their
employees
and
a
union?
i
take
it
you
think
texas
is
statutorily
and
constitutionally
capable
of
forbidding
such
agreements?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
never
doubted
it,
mr.
streicher.
