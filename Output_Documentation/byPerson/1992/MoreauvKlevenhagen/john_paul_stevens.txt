justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
what
if
there
were
an
agreement,
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
existence
which
prohibited
the
use
of
comp
time,
would
subparagraph
2
apply,
because
those
employees
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
it
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
were
forbidden
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
they
can
have
a
representative,
they
just
can't
enter
into
an
agreement
with
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
literally
they
have
a
representative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
if
you
read
the
secretary's
regulation
literally
that
just
would
mean
that's
kind
of
tough
luck.
you
cannot
make
the
agreement
that
you
need
to
make
to
provide
for
comp
time.
and
that's
one
way
to
read
it.
it's
unfortunate,
but
state
law
just
disables
you
from
taking
advantage
of
this
exception
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
regulations
mean
what
they
say
literally,
and
they
may
or
may
not,
you
weren't
entitled
to
do
that
because
the
subparagraph
(i)
prohibition
kicked
in
and
said
you
can't
have
it,
as
interpreted
by
the
secretary.
well,
i'm
just
covering
the
same
ground
that
has
been
covered.
i
gather
that
your
answer
in
your
brief,
or
in
somebody's
brief,
to
the
language
at
the
bottom
of
34a
was
the
language
at
the
top
of
35a,
wasn't
it,
namely
the
sentence
that
says
it
is
the
department's
intention
that
the
question
of
whether
employees
have
a
representative
for
purposes
of
flsa
section
7(o)
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
state
or
local
law
and
practices.
that
and
the
preceding
sentence,
i
gather,
could
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
you
cannot
have
an
agreement
with
a
designated
representative
if
the
state
law
does
not
permit
that
agreement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
it
says
is
they
shall
have
a
representative,
not
whether
they
shall
have
an
agreement
with
a
representative.
i
mean,
it's
really
not
very
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
that
the
collective
bargaining
agent
can
enter
into
comp
time
agreements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
yes
or
no.
