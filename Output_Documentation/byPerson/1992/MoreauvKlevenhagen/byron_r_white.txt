is
it
your
position
that
the
employer
may
on
his
own
substitute
comp
time
for
overtime
even
if
he
doesn't
deal
with
individual
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
does
harris
county
forbid
dealing
with
individual
employees?
justice

comp
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
haven't
labor
department
regulations
been
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
had
a
representative
or
not.
they
might
have
a
representative,
but
they
would
have
no
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
be
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
their
representative.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
the
regulation
says
if
there's
a
representative,
if
there
is
a
representative
been
designated
there
has
to
be
an
agreement,
regardless
of
what
state
law
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that's
the
law
certainly
the...
if
that's
the
controlling
law
the
regulation,
to
the
extent
it
says
that
if
there's
a
representative
been
named
there
must
be
an
agreement,
that
just
doesn't
hold
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
whether
it's
enforceable
or
not
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
are
employees
covered
by
little
(i)?
