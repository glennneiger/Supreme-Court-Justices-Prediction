mr.
richard
h.
seamon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
a
question
that
justice
stevens
posed
to
my
colleague,
which
is
whether
under
our
interpretation
of
article
iii(a)
of
the
iad,
the
provision
doesn't
contain
unnecessary
language.
pardon
me.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
no.
now,
justice
stevens
asked
why
the
article
iii(a)
is
not
drafted
so
as
to
simply
trigger
the
180
days
after
delivery
of
the
prisoner's
request.
my...
i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
to
that
comes
from
the
drafting
history,
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
21.
the
drafters
note...
pardon
me...
the
council
of
state
governments,
which
opposed
the
iad
in
1957,
actually
proposed
two
state...
two
agreement
proposals
at
the
same
time,
one
based
on
interstate
detainers
and
one
governing
intrastate
detainers.
the
speedy
trial
provisions
in
both
proposals
were
virtually
identical,
and
the
council
noted
that
the
intrastate
proposal
was
based
on
statutes
then
in
effect
in
california
and
oregon.
both
the
california
and
oregon
statutes
plainly
required
actual
receipt
for
triggering
of
the
speedy
trial
provision.
we
suggest
that
the
drafters
did
not
intend
to
change
the
actual
receipt
requirement.
the
relevant
differences
between
the
state
models
on
which
the
iad
was
based
and
the
iad
itself
is
the
wording
requiring
the
prisoner
to
have
caused
delivery
of
the
required
documents.
there
are
two
reasons
for
that
wording
requiring
the
prisoner
to
cause
delivery.
first
is
the
whole
topic
of
article
iii
is
that
the
prisoner
has
initiated
the
process
of
disposing
of
the
charges
underlying
the
detainer.
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
has
initiated
the
process
is
what
distinguishes
article
iii
from
article
iv,
which
deals
with
when
the
state
initiates
the
process
of
disposing
of
the
charges.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
he
causes--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no.
under
article
iii,
there
are
two
acts
that
must
occur
before
the
180-day
period
begins.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
and
specifically
under
article
iii,
he
has
to
cause
the
transmittal
of
his
documents,
and
the
documents
actually
have
to
be
delivered.
and
there's
no
dispute
here
that
delivery
means
actual
receipt.
article
iii(a)
differs
from
the
state
proposals
on
which--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--the
oregon
statute
revolved...
was
built
around
the
verb
receive.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
problem
with
using
the
verb
receive
rather
than
the
verb
deliver
in
article
iii
is
that
then
you
would
shift
the
focus
of
article
iii
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
appropriate
courts
receiving
it.
that
would
shift
the
focus
away
from
the
prisoner,
and
the
prisoner
has
a
vital
role
under
article
iii
as
opposed
to
article
iv
because
he
initiates
the
process.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
but
article
iii
as
distinguished--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i'm
sorry.
i
may
have
misspoken.
the
scheme
of
article
iii
focuses
on
the
prisoner's
having
initiated
the
process.
and
so,
using
the
prisoner
as
the
subject
of
the
relevant
clause
we're
talking
about
makes
sense
in
understanding
why
article
iii
is
different
from
article
iv
of
the
iad
because
article
iv
is
directed
at
the
state.
and,
of
course,
the
other
reason
for
using
the
word
cause
in
the
relevant
wording
is
that
the
prisoner
does
not
make
an
actual
delivery
directly
to
the
court
and
the
prosecutor
in
the
receiving
state.
instead,
under
article
iii(c),
he
is
required
to
give
his
request
for
disposition
to
the
wardens
who
are
then
required
to
promptly
forward
it
to
the
receiving
state.
that's
why
the
causing
language
is
in
there.
and...
but
the
gist
of
article
iii
is
to
require
a
communication
between
the
prisoner
and
the
prosecutor
in
the
receiving
state.
and
it
is
only
when
that
communication,
namely,
the
prisoner's
request
for
disposition,
has
been
completed
that
the
prosecutor's
duty
to
bring
the
prisoner
to
trial
in
a
speedy
manner
begins,
and
that
he
cannot
know
of
his
duty
to
do
so
until
he
has
actually
received
the
request
for
disposition.
the
other
point
about
the
relevant
language
of
article
iii
i'd
like
to
repeat
is
one
that
justice
souter
raised,
which
is
that
the
drafters
could
easily
have
drafted
article
iii(a)
to
trigger
the
180-day
period
to
begin
when
the
prisoner
sent
or
gave
his
request
for
disposition
to
the
warden
officials.
in
fact,
the
language
of
giving
or
sending
is
included
in
article
iii(b).
therefore,
it
would
have
been
natural,
had
the
drafters
intended
to
adopt
petitioner's
rule,
for
them
to
have
used
similar
language
in
article
iii(a).
the
use
of
different
language
suggested
that
they
had
a
different
intention.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
question.
certainly
once
he
receives
the
prisoner's
request,
he
then
has
180
days.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
ultimately
there
are
sixth
amendment
limitations.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
there
are
none.
i
would
note
that
under
the
speedy
trial
act
in
the
federal
system,
my
answer
would
be
different
because
the
speedy
trial
act
does
give
a
federal
prosecutor
a
duty
to
file
the
detainer
if
he
knows
that
a
prisoner,
who
has
been
charged
with
a
crime,
is
in
a
state.
but
the
iad
itself
does
not.
and
we
recognize
at
the
same
time
that
states
have
an
interest
in
processing
these
requests
speedily,
and
in
fact,
that
the
prison
officials
have
a
duty...
and
we
would
suggest
in
most
cases,
they
live
up
to
that
duty...
of
sending
on
the
prisoner's
paperwork
promptly.
nonetheless,
the
iad
itself
does
not
contain
a
sanction
for
addressing
the
situation
in
which
a
state
does
not
forward
those
documents
promptly.
that
doesn't
mean
there
are
no
remedies.
both
at
the
political
level,
the
state...
a
state
that
has
been
negligent
in
fulfilling
its
duty
may
well
be
subject
to
political
pressure
from
other
states
that
are
parties
to
the
iad,
and
at
an
individual
level,
the
prisoner
himself
certainly
has
remedies
by
way
of
mandamus
or
the
internal
grievance
procedure
that
is
present
in
all
prison
systems,
including
the
federal
system.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
agree
with
my
colleague's
explanation
of
houston
v.
lack.
houston
v.
lack
concerned
a
very
different--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--the
court
construed
the
language
of
rule
4(a)
to
avoid
an
interpretation
that
would
have
effectively
disastrous
consequences
for
the
prisoner
in
that
case.
he
would
have
lost
his
right
to
appeal
on
the
merits
of
his
conviction.
and
here
the
consequences
are
much
different.
they
are
noteworthy,
of
course.
the
prisoner
suffers
a
delay
in
coming
to
trial,
but
nonetheless,
they
are
much
less
drastic.
in
fact,
the
consequences
that
are
drastic
here
are
visited
upon
the
prosecutor
who
suffers
dismissal
of
the
charges
against
the
prisoner
perhaps
simply
through
the
fortuity
of
the
prisoner's
request
being
lost
through
the
mail.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
did
not
cite
houston
v.
lack
in
our
brief
because
we
don't
think
it's
apposite.
we
did
cite
a
jurisprudentially
related
case
of
fallen
v.
united
states
on
page
12.
that
concludes
my
presentation.
i
thank
the
court.
