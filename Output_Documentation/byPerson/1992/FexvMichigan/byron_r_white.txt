when
you
mail
a
check,
you
may
think
you've
paid
it,
but
have
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example,
if
you
didn't
have
sufficient
funds,
do
you
think
you've
paid
your
bill?
no.
that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
you
want
to
comply
with
our
time
requirements,
if
you
have
a
little
verification
that
you
put
it
in
the
mail
on
time,
you
are
in
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
isn't
like
increasing
his
sentence
or
anything.
it's
just
a...
it
just
means
that
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
have
a
few
more
days
extra
to
try
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr....
excuse
me.
so,
you
think
the
prosecutor
in
the
other
state
should
take
the
risk
of
delay
by
the
prison
authorities
and
by
the
mail.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
answer
is
yes,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
i
need
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
a
lot
of
people
who
are
charged
with
a
crime
would
rather
delay
the
trial?
a
lot
of
people
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
a...
is
there
some
experience
that
you've
had
or
that
other
people
have
had
that
indicate
that
when
a
detainer
is
filed,
the
prisoner
immediately
requests
for
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
justice
stevens
and
say,
well,
by
his
calculation,
when
it
isn't
delivered,
it's
the
prisoner
who
has
caused
it
to
be
nondelivered.
he
has
given
it
to
the
prison
authorities,
and
he...
and
anticipating
it
be
sent
in
the
mail,
and
either
the
prison
authorities
or
the
mail
failed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
he
caused
it
to
be
nondelivered.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
99
percent
of
your
returns
from
the
prison
where
you...
to
which
you
have
sent
a
detainer,
they
do
have
a
time
stamp
on
it
as
to
when
the
prisoner
gave
the
demand
to
the
authorities
to
deliver.
you
would
have
no
problem
then
about
when
the
180
days
starts,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
always
happens
because
the
mail
fails.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
of
us
who
were
in
dissent?
justice
byron
r.
white
he...
the
prosecutor
doesn't
get
any
extra
days.
he
just
gets
the
days
he's
entitled
to.
