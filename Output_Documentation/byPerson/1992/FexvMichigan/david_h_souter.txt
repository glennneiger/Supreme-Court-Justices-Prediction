souter
your
argument
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
the
statute
said
sent,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a
distinction
we
ought
to
bear
in
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
still
have
the
problem
that
he
didn't
cause
it
to
be
sent?
the
statute
does
not
speak
of
his
causing
it
to
be
sent.
the
statute
speaks
of
his
causing
it
to
be
delivered.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i
was
trying
to
suggest.
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
payne.
