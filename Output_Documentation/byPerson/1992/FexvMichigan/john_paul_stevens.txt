justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it's
a
little
different
than
that,
isn't
it,
mr.
payne?
supposing
in
the
first
of
october,
after
the
prosecutor
had
received
the
document,
someone
said
to
the
prisoner
on
what
date
did
you
cause
that
document
to
be
delivered
to
the
prosecutor,
what
would
your
answer
be?
when
did
he
cause
it
to
be
delivered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
say
you're
mailing
a
letter
paying
a
bill,
and
after
the
bill
has
been
paid
somebody
asked
when
did
you
cause
that
letter
to
be
delivered.
would
your
answer
be
when
it
was
received
or
when
you
mailed
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
these
have
been
delivered.
these
are
documents
that
have
been
delivered.
that's
undisputed,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
only
question
is
when
did
he
cause
it
to
be
delivered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
couldn't
say
when
did
you
send
it
here
because
he
doesn't
send
it,
does
he?
he
gives
it
to
someone
else
to
send
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
statute
doesn't
say
after
it
was
delivered,
does
it?
it
says
after
he
caused
it
to
be
delivered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
helps
you,
by
the
way.
it
doesn't
hurt
you.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
payne,
earlier
i
think
you
started
to
comment
on
the
government's
use
of
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
where
they
refer
to
a
comment
that
the
180
days
is...
it's
kind
of
ambiguous,
but
were
you
going
to...
and
you
never
finished
what
you
were
going
to
say
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
statute
provide
that
the
prisoners
get
any
kind
of
notice
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
delivered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
how
would
he
know
whether
he
had
a
suit
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just
assumes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
they'll
carry
through,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
you
left
out
the
key
word.
he
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered.
and
who
is
the
he
to
whom
the
statute
refers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
when
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right,
and
what
is
the
last
time
he
did
anything
to
cause
it
to
be
delivered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
isn't
that
date
he
shall
have
caused
it
to
be
delivered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
doesn't
the
statute
say
after
delivery
if
that's
what
it
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
these
words
are
superfluous
under
your
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
doesn't
mean
after
he
shall
have
caused
it
to
be
delivered.
it
says
after
it
was
delivered
is
what
you're
saying
it
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
unnecessary
words
that
are
not
needed
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
don't
we
generally
construe
statutes
to
avoid
assuming
that
certain
words
are
totally
unnecessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
words,
have
caused
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
that
wasn't
the
question.
the
question
is
after
delivery
and
you
ask
the
person
who
has
mailed
the
thing
to
you
and
you
said
to
him
when
did
you
cause
it
to
be
delivered.
and
you're
telling
me
you
would
answer
that
by
saying,
oh,
when
you
got
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that's
perfectly
plain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nobody
caused
it
to
be
delivered
if
it
never
got
there.
after
it
has
gotten
there--
--caused
to
be
nondelivered.
he
caused
it
to
be
nondelivered.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
obviously,
it
has
to
be
delivered
before
they
can
be
a
cause
of
the
delivery,
but
once
it
has
been
delivered,
you
ask
when
did
he
cause
it
to
be
delivered.
and
you
say
he
caused
it
to
be
delivered
20
days--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--after
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
it's
complete,
but
the
question
is
always
asked
at
a
period
after
the
delivery
has
been
completed.
that's
the
hypothesis
in
all
these
cases,
and
you're
just
measuring
the
date
at
which
he
caused
it
to
be
delivered.
it
has
always
been
delivered.
so,
your
future...
you
always
look
at
it
after
the
transaction
has
been
completed
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem
otherwise.
that
is
correct.
and
the
way
to
interpret
it,
the
way
to
look
at
it
is
starts
the
day
that
the
prosecutor
receives,
and
that's
what
it
says.
it
doesn't
say
it
in
the...
those
words,
but
that
is
what
it
says.
when
the
prosecutor
gets
this
material...
let
me
ask
this
question...
does...
will
he
have
any
way
of
knowing
when
it
was
handed
to
the
warden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they...
have
they
learned
about
the
invention
of
the
time
stamp
in
jackson
county?
so,
you
couldn't
time
stamp
it
in
the
county
where
the
prisoner
gives
it
to
the
warden.
there's
no
way
of
keeping
a
record
of
that
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
think
they
know
how
to
do
it
in
fort
wayne.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
in
michigan,
aren't
you?
and
he
was
in
jail
in
fort
wayne.
so,
i
imagine
he
couldn't
go
into
your--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
couldn't
the
fort--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
couldn't
the
fort
wayne
authorities?
wouldn't
they
as
a
routine?
how
do
they
know
that
this
one
was
actually
on
september
7?
they
rely
on
his
testimony,
or
do
they
have
some
kind
of
record
keeping
that
enables
them
to
fix
that
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that
risk
should
be
taken
by
the
prisoner
rather
than
negotiating
with
the
other
state.
you
don't
speak
to
one
another
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
how
does
the
prisoner
know
he
hasn't
sent
it
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
certainly
is...
he
has
to
wait
the
full
statutory
period
before
he
has
any
opportunity
to
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
need
an
agreement
on
detainer
statute
or
agreements
if
you
can
rely
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
states
have
a
mutual
interest
in
working
together
in
implementing
the
statute,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
don't
cooperate
with
indiana,
indiana
won't
cooperate
with
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
assume
that
the
two
of
you
have
a
common
interest
in
promptly
processing
these
requests
and
keeping
proper
records
and
all
the
rest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
here
we
have
states
that
have
signed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
houston
against
lack
case?
are
you
familiar
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
california
statute
is
interesting
because
that's
perfectly
clear.
it
says
shall
have
delivered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nothing
except
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
he
initiate
the
process?
by
causing
something
to
be
delivered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that's
what
you
focus
on,
is
his
act
in
initiating
the
process
is
the
key
act
in
whole
statutory
scheme.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
file
a
detainer
with
the
prison
i'm
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
talk
about
the
drafting
history,
i'm
surprised
they
didn't
follow
the
oregon
statute
which
was
an
equally
clear
model
for
this
under
your
view
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
precisely
the
shift
in
focus
which
you
say
the
drafters
intended.
it
should
focus
on
receipt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
whole
scheme,
rather,
focused
on
the
prisoner
which
would
seem
to
focus
on
when
he
caused
it
to
be
delivered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i'd
just
be
curious
as
to
what
you'd
have
to
say
about
houston
against
lack.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
plain...
the
language
in
that
rule
is
any
less
plain
than
this?
