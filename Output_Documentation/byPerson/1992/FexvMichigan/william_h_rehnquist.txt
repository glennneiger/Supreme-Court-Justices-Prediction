we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-7873,
william
fex
v.
michigan.
mr.
payne,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
payne,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
the
jackson
county
prosecutor
in
michigan
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
he
have
control
over
what
goes
on
in
the
indiana
prison?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
depends
on
the
action
of
the
individual
inmate,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
payne.
mr.
schrotenboer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do--
--and
that's
the
way
these
cases
come
up,
isn't
it?
the
prosecutor
does
file
a
detainer
because--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--he
wants
to
bring
the
defendant
back
for
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schrotenboer.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
seamon,
is
there
anything
in
the
iad
that
requires
a
prosecutor
to
move
promptly
in
order
to
get
a
prisoner
back
for
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no.
supposing
he
just
says
i'm
not
sure
whether
i
want
this
guy
to
come
back
for
trial,
so
i'm
not
going
to
put
a
detainer
on
him.
i
might
do
it
next
year.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
said
in
the
iad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
mr.
payne,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
payne.
the
case
is
submitted.
