mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
asking
that
the
court
affirm
this
particular
case.
both
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
the
vast
majority
of
jurisdictions
have
correctly
ruled
that
article
iii,
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers'
180-day
provision,
begins
with
the
actual
receipt
by
the
prosecutor,
and
i'm
asking
you
to
rule
the
same
essentially
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
after
all,
this
is
a
statutory
interpretation
case.
secondly,
the
congressional
history,
and
third,
the
actual
policy
considerations,
which
actually
favor
respondent's
position,
which
favor
the
position
of
a
vast
majority
of
jurisdictions.
the
first
is
the
statute's
language
itself.
this
phrase...
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
the
phrase
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
the
inmate,
of
course.
the
inmate--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
when
he
handed
it
to
the
warden.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
no.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
you
can
always--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--no.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that's
right.
it's
written
up
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
add
in
an
extra
sentence.
he
shall--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--no.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
of
course,
but
i
don't
quite
understand
what's
unnecessary
under
this
interpretation.
yes.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes.
caused
to
be
delivered,
and
that's
the
key
point
here.
and
that
shows
that
it's
180
days
from
actual
receipt.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes,
it
does
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
it's
in
the
future
perfect
tense.
if
it
was
the
time
that
he
actually
received
it...
i
mean,
that
he
handed
it
to
him,
it
wouldn't
be
future
perfect.
future
perfect
means
complete
and
in
the
future,
after
he
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered.
and
the
second
reason
is
the
use
of
the
word
delivery
itself.
your
honor
yourself
used
the
word
delivered
that
way.
well,
when
you
asked
the
question
this
morning
is
there
any
doubt
that
the
documents
have
been
delivered.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that's
right.
[laughter]
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that
is
sufficiently
plain
given
everything
in
this
particular
case.
the
word
delivered...
you
know,
just
yesterday
on
the
television
i
heard
an
advertisement
for
federal
express.
we
confirm
delivery.
that
would
be
totally
meaningless
if
we
confirm
having
sent
it
on.
you
know,
ups,
the
best
delivery
service
in
the
business,
it
means...
if
they're
going
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
we
sent
it
on
and
that's
all
that
we
care
about,
we
don't
really
care
that
much
about
actual
receipt,
they're
not
going
to
get
too
much.
the
phrase
is
not
that
ambiguous.
yes,
it
was
written
by
a
lawyer,
and
that's
sometimes
a
problem
and
that's
why
we're
here.
but
those...
it
is
sufficiently
clear
to
show
that
that
is
what
was
intended,
which
is
exactly
what
the
vast
majority
of
jurisdictions
have
ruled.
and
the
second
reason,
of
course,
in
going--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
no,
no.
that's--
[laughter]
that's
not...
no.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
no.
the...
let's
not
forget
the
phrase
here
is
shall
start...
you
know,
let's
go
back
a
little
bit
further--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--that
is
true.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that
is
true.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
when
he--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--the
phrase
is
he
shall
be
brought
to
trial
within
180
days
after
he
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered,
and
that
is
the
future
perfect.
the
word
perfect
means
complete.
and,
therefore,
it
starts
with
actual
receipt.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
third
point
in
here,
the
policy
consideration.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes.
considering
jackson
county
has
the
largest
walled
prison
in
the
world,
yes,
i
can
say
they've
been
known
to
lie.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
we
have
learned
the
time
stamp
in
jackson
county.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
but
for
some
strange
reason,
mr.
fex
did
not
bother
walking
over
to
our
office
on
september
7
to
have
it
time
stamped.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that
is
probably
some
type
of
record
keeping
in
this
particular
case.
but
that's
the
point.
the
inmate
is
in
a
better
position
to
monitor
it.
although
that
does
not
seem
correct
on
its
face,
it
actually
is
correct.
the
prosecutor--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--yes.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes.
being
rather
intimately
connected
with
the
michigan
department
of
corrections,
i'd
certainly
hate
to
be
subjected
to
that.
they
have
the
reception
and
guidance
center
in
jackson
too.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
as
long
as
the
prison
bothers
sending
that
little
piece
of
information
on.
i
haven't
always
received
that
thing.
i
handle
the
extraditions
in
jackson
too.
it
doesn't
always
happen.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
it
doesn't
always
happen
because
the
prison
officials
don't
always
bother
sending
that
piece
of
information
on.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that
is
correct,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
prisoner
is
in
the
vastly
better
position.
yes,
the
jackson
prosecutor's
office
knew
that
he
was
in
the
county
jail,
but
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
had
not
yet
kicked
in
then
because
he
hadn't
been
under
a
judgment
of
sentence,
which
is
the
very
first
phrase
of
subsection
(a),
article
iii.
we
did
not
know
he
was
under
a
term
of
imprisonment
until
months
later.
the
prosecutor's
office
doesn't
always
send
out
detainers.
very
often
it's
police
agencies
that
send
them.
very
often
a
detainer
is
filed
with
the
jail
which
is,
of
course,
before
the
iad
kicks
in.
and
then
it
is
forwarded
on,
along
with
the
judgment
of
sentence,
to
the
prison
system,
and
they
don't
bother
letting
the
prosecutor
know
about
it.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
i
don't
see
it
as
an
obligation.
i
think
it
might
be
wise
to
do
something
like
that.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
statutory
duties.
there
is
no
statutory
duty
for
the
prosecutor
to
file
any
detainer
at
all.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that
is
entirely
on
the
inmate
to
trigger
it.
the...
as
this
court
stated
in
united
states
against
mauro,
the
triggering
part
of
the
act
is
the
filing
of
the
detainer
itself.
if
the
prosecutor
doesn't
feel
like
filing
the
detainer,
the
act
doesn't
apply.
if
there's
no
detainer,
there's
no
problem.
so,
there's
no
duty
by
the
prosecutor.
it
would
be
wise
for
the
prosecutor
to
do
it
if
he
feels
like
getting
the
guy
back
to
try
him,
particularly
now
as
opposed
to
later.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
or
someone
does.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
it
is
proper
procedure,
but
it's
certainly
not
mandated.
what
it...
the
detainer
in
the
jail
is,
of
course,
nothing
but
a
hold
on
him.
please
don't
let
him
go.
we
have
a
felony
or
something
or
other
against
him.
please
don't
let
him
go
before
you
send
him
to
us.
and,
of
course,
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
does
not
apply
to
that
situation.
that
is
exceptional--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--it
goes
into
effect
when
a
detainer
is
filed
after
he
has...
is
under
a
judgment
of
sentence.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
you
file
a
second
detainer
to
make
sure
that
the
prison
system
knows
so
that
they
don't
let
him
go.
if
they
tell
me
that
there's
somebody
in
a...
another
prison,
i'll
file
the
detainer
right
away.
i'm
not
going
to
think,
well,
maybe
an
earlier
detainer
is
following
it
along,
this
thing,
and
that
thing.
no,
i'm
going
to
type
out
myself
a
letter
and
i'm
going
to
send
it
out.
but
it's
the
inmate
who
is
in
a
better
position
to
monitor
it
than
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
very
often
doesn't
know
it.
the
inmate,
yes,
42
u.s.c.,
section
1983,
this
court's
case,
adams
against
cuyler.
if
the
warden
send
it
on,
that's
a
subsection
(b)
violation.
he
can
sue
for
that.
also--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--well,
subsection
(c)
requires...
well,
he'll
know.
when
nothing
happens
after
the...
after,
say,
180
days
has
gone
by,
he'll
know.
he'll
know.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
to
a
certain
extent,
that's
right.
and
then
he
can
sue.
and
also,
sixth
amendment
right
to
speedy
trial,
which
overrides
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
no.
i'm
saying
that
that
supplements
it.
of
course,
we
need
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
facilitate
trial.
it's
not
so
easy
walking
over
to
a
prison
in
another
state
and
say
i'd
like
to
pick
up
this
inmate
and
come
over
across
the
line.
you
know,
it's
as
easy
walking
into
canada
and
asking
for
that.
you
have
to
go
through
the
extradition
procedures,
and
this
is,
in
a
sense,
an
extradition
act.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
that's--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--that
is
basically
correct--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--even
though
two
states
have
not
signed
the
iad.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
both
of
them
have
signed
it.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
yes,
i
am.
houston
against
lack
absolutely
does
not
control
in
this
case.
it
is
superficially
similar,
but
it
does
not
control.
it
was
a
5-4
case.
i
know
that
your
honor
and
your
honor,
justice
blackmun,
were
in
the
majority--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--nothing.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
houston
against--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--yes,
i'm
kind
of
trying
to
remind
people.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
you
were
in
the
majority.
[laughter]
i'm
trying
to
remind
the
people
who
were
in
the
dissent.
the
case
dealt
with
a
habeas
petitioner
who
had
lost
in
the
district
court.
he
then
appealed.
it's
the
30-day
federal
rule
4(a)(1)
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
he
appealed.
the
30-day
procedure
is
jurisdictional.
what
he
loses
by
not
making
it
on
time
is
his
appeal.
the
reason...
and
this
court
said
for
purposes
of
this
statute,
we're
going
to
start
it
the
day
he
hands
it
over
to
the
warden.
the
reason
it's
different
is
because
this
is
a
fairness
case.
actually
i
agree
with
it,
but
that's
beside
the
point.
it's
a
fairness
case.
it's
unfair
for
the
inmate.
inmates
are
in
a
little
tougher
situation
than
normal
people
are
because
they
can't
just
walk
over
to
a
courthouse
and
hand
it
over
to
them.
that
is...
and
that's
why
this
court
in
cases
like
haines
against
koerner
and
things
like
that
have
given
inmates
special
deference.
but
there's
something
extra
in
the
present
case.
the
inmate
in
the
present
case...
it's
not
he
loses
the
appeal,
but
he
just...
the
prosecutor
gets
a
few
extra
days,
a
few
extra
hundred
days.
and
also
houston
against
lack
is
a
two-party
case.
the
only
parties
are
the
inmate--
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
--actually
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
a
few
extra
days
as
opposed
to
the
other
interpretation.
houston
against
lack
was
a
two-party
case.
the
only
parties
are
the
court
system
and
the
inmate.
in
the
present
case,
we're
talking
a
three-party.
there's
the
prosecutor
too.
there's
no
unfairness
to
the
prosecutor
in
houston
against
lack.
in
the
present
case,
there's
a
lot
of
unfairness
to
the
prosecutor.
i
guess
the
only
other
point.
going
back
to
the
language
itself,
this
court
itself
in
carchman
against
nash
actually
said
it
starts
from
actual
receipt.
it's
not
quite
the
words
it
used.
you,
of
course,
can
read
it,
yes,
it
is
dicta,
but
that's
my
point.
it's
the
actual
language.
it's
the
common
usage
of
the
language.
and,
of
course,
there's
the
congressional
history,
and
i
guess...
which
is
spelled
out
both
in
my
brief.
the
senate
report
makes
it
very
obvious.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
going
into
the
california
and
oregon
statutes
really
make
it
obvious
that
this
is
what
the
drafters
intended.
and
the
very
last
point
is
we
do
have
an
extra
issue
here,
subsection
(c).
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
the
reason
that
it
is
different
is
because
that
requires
the
inmate
to
send
it
on
to
the
prosecutor.
the
iad
is
better
because
it
requires
the
warden
to
send
it
on
so
that
when
the
prosecutor
gets
it,
it
will
be
more
reliable
and
more
thorough.
the
prosecutor
really
should
have
information
like
minimum
out
date,
maximum
out
date,
and
the
warden
is
more
likely
to
provide
reliable
information
on
that
point.
thus,
the
change
in
language.
but
there's
absolutely
nothing
anywhere
that
shows
that
the
drafters
intended
to
change
the
date
of
actual
receipt
as
the
day
for
the
180
days
to
start.
mr.
jerrold
schrotenboer
well,
whatever.
the
only
other
question
in
the
case
is
a
claimed
subsection
(c)
violation.
i'm
going
to
have
to
rely
on
my
brief
in
that
case
to
the
extent
that...
except
to
say
there
is
no
evidence
presented
whatsoever
that
subsection
(c)
was
violated,
and
petitioner
has
not
even
requested
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
that.
and
secondly,
there
is
no
actual
prejudice
whatsoever,
even
alleged.
other
than
to
ask
the
court
to
affirm,
this
ends
my
presentation,
and
i
ask
if
anyone
has
any
questions.
