mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
5
years
ago
today,
there
was
a
robbery
in
jackson
county
of
a
rax
restaurant
that
gave
rise
to
the...
this
case.
i'd
like
to
note
that
my
opponent
pointed
that
out
to
me,
but
it
is
an
interesting
coincidence.
on
february
29,
1988,
a
complaint
was
issued
by
the
jackson
county
sheriff's...
or
jackson
county
prosecutor
that
showed
that
the
residence
of
the
defendant
was
the
fort
wayne,
indiana
jail,
and
that's
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
2.
i
don't
have
any
specific
references
in
the
joint
appendix
between
that
date
and
september
7
of
1988,
but
on
that
day,
my
client,
mr.
william
fex,
signed
a
request
for
disposition
under
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
between
that
date
and
september
26,
1988,
there
is
again
something
of
a
void,
but
that
is
the
date
on
which
the
prosecutor
urges
that
they
actually
received
the
request
for
distribution...
or
request
for
disposition
of
the
detainer,
and
that
is
the
date
that
we
will
concede
that
they
actually
received
the
request
for
disposition.
the
question
here
is
does
the
signing
of
the
request
for
disposition
on
september
7
or
does
the
receipt
of
the
request
for
disposition
trigger
the
180-day
limitation
on
prosecution
under
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
from
the
time
that
my
client
was
sentenced
in
indiana
until
he
was
transferred
to
michigan
for
prosecution
in
this
present
case,
he
was
effectively
prevented
from
participating
in
any
rehabilitation
at
the
prison
in
indiana.
and
that
is
the
problem.
that
is
the
injury
here.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
no,
there
wasn't
any
opportunity
because
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
issued...
and
i
cannot
believe
that
the
michigan
prosecutor's
office
didn't
have
some
kind
of
communication
with
the
indiana
prosecutor's
office
and
the
court
there.
this
was
before
he
was
sentenced
in
indiana.
it
was
before
he
was
convicted,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
from
the
time
that
he
was
convicted,
there
was
at
least
a
hold,
if
not
a
technical
detainer--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
a
complaint
is
one
of
the
documents
that
is
listed
under
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
and
so,
from
the
day
that
he
was
sentenced,
i
believe
that
was
in...
on
or
about
april
26,
he
was
under
the
act,
and
he
should
have
been
notified.
but
he
was
not
notified
until
september
7.
i
would
like
to
make
three
points
here
during
my
argument.
the
first
point
is
that
the
injury
here
is
not
merely
to
my
client.
it
is
an
injury
to
the
society
as
a
whole
because
it
prevents
the
rehabilitation
of
the
prisoner.
i
would
also
like
to
stress
that
the
prisoner
here
is
not
in
control.
the
prosecutor
in
the
receiving
state
and
the
jailers
are
in
control.
they
are
in
very
firm
control,
and
by
manipulating
the
paperwork
properly,
they
can
either
ensure
a
prompt
disposition
or
they
can
delay
it.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
sufficiently
clear.
we
have
the
statute
which
says
that
the
prosecutor
shall
have
180
days
after
the
prisoner
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered
this
request.
now,
you
have
three
concepts.
one
is
that
the
prisoner
makes
a
demand.
two
is
that
the
demand
is
transmitted
through
his
jailers,
and
three,
that
there's
180
days.
and
i
think
that
from
a
grammatical
standpoint
or
from
a
logical
standpoint,
the
requirement
of
the
180
days
will
follow
the
other
two
requirements.
so,
the
natural
way
that
you
would
say
this
is
that
the
prisoner
makes
a
demand.
he
gives
it
to
the
jailer,
and
then
there's
180
days
that
the
prosecutor
has
to
bring
the
action.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
he
would...
if
he
knew
what
he
was
after,
he
would
say
it's
september
7
when
he
signed
it.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
i
would
say
when
it
was
mailed.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--it's
kind
of
an
unusual
phraseology.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
he
caused
it
on
september
7,
and--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes,
it
would
be,
justice.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
yes,
and
it
still
is
not
clear,
though,
because
normally
you
wouldn't
ask
somebody
when
did
you
cause
your
light
bill
to
be
paid.
you
would
say
when
did
you
send
it
or
when
was
it
received.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
the
emphasis
should
be
on
he,
and
it's
on
what
he
does.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
before
the
lunch
break,
we
were...
i
was
asked
a
question
about
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered,
and
the
only
answer
i
have
is
that
this
is
ultimately
an
ambiguous
way
of
phrasing
the
requirement.
when
somebody
is
asking
whether
or
when
a
phone
bill
or
a
light
bill
was
paid,
the
question
is
when
did
you
send
it,
and
the
answer,
of
course,
is
on
the
day
that
it
was
put
in
the
mail.
the
senate
report
to
91-1356
has
a
somewhat
different
formulation
in
explaining
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
than
the
excerpt
that...
on
which
the
solicitor
general
and
the
respondent
reply.
there--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--we're
in
somewhat
of
an--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--artificial
situation
here
because
we're
dealing
with
the--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--well,
justice,
if
you
are
accepting
a...
an
offer
of
a
contract,
the
offer
of
a
contract
is
accepted
when
it
is
put
in
the
mail
or
when
you
have
delivered
the
offer
to
the
agent
of
the...
or
when
you've
delivered
your
acceptance
to
the
agent
of
the
offeror.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
the
bottom
line
here
i
think
is
that
the
prison
authority
is
the
agent
of
the
prosecutor.
and
mr.
schrotenboer
urges
that
the
prison
authorities
have
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
time
in
order
to
respond
to
the
request
for
disposition.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
they
really
don't.
as
a
matter
of
act,
in
this
case,
the
certificate
of
inmate
status
was
executed
on
the
same
day
that
the
inmate
executed
his
request
for
disposition,
and
even
if
they
needed
a
day
or
two,
they
could
process
that
paperwork
before
they
gave
the
request
for
disposition
to
the
prisoner
so
that
it
would
be
all
ready
to
go
when
he
signed
it.
now,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
prisoner
is
in
control.
i
handle
habeas
corpuses...
habeas
corpus
case.
i
handle
section
1983
cases.
i
handle
a
lot
of
criminal
appeals,
and
i
visit
prisoners
on
a
regular
basis.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
prisoners
do
not
have
control
over
their
jailers.
they
can
manipulate
the
system
with
petitions
and--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--writs.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
but--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--well,
they
can
manipulate.
they
can
disrupt.
they
can
cause
effects
outside
of
the
prison,
and
certainly
they
can
disrupt
the
internal
affairs
of
the
prison,
but
they
don't
have
control
over
their
jailers
to
the
extent
that
they
would
be
able
to
ensure
that
the
prison
sends
the
request
for
distribution
to
the
prosecutor.
and
that's
the
kernel
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee's
handling
of
this
issue.
they
said
that--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--no,
i
am
not,
your--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--i
will...
i
thank
you
for
that.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
okay,
thank
you.
in
any
case,
the
prison...
the
moore
case,
which
is
probably
the
primary
case
on
which
the
respondent
relies,
from
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
would
hold
that,
number
one,
the
prisoner
is
responsible
for
ensuring
that
the
jailer
sends
the
request
for
disposition.
and
if
the
prison
does
not
do
so,
then
that's
chalked
up
against
the
prisoner.
it
is
not...
any
delay
by
the
prison
is
not
considered
against
the
prosecutor's
180
days.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
well,
in
some
cases,
it's
a
few
more
days.
in
moore,
it
was
225
days,
but
the
problem
here
is
that
all
of
the
time
that
the
prisoner
is
under
detainer,
he's
unable
to
get
favorable
work
assignments.
he's
unable
to
get
rehabilitative
services.
he's
in
general...
in
this
case,
my
client
was
in
segregation
that
period
of
time.
he's
unable
to
be
rehabilitated,
and
that's
the...
the
intent
of
the
legislature
is
to
address
that
problem.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
well,
justice
white,
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
yes,
and
may
i
amplify
that?
when
the
prosecutor
sends
the
request
for...
when
the
prosecutor
sends
the
detainer
to
the
prison
authorities,
the
prosecutor
certainly
should
know
that
they
have
done
it.
and
if
they
keep
any
kind
of
a
log
and
if
the
paperwork
is
properly
set
up
so
that...
for
example,
you
have
a
one-write
system
in
accounting
or
in
docket
management...
if
the
prosecutor
sets
up
its
paperwork
trail
and
keeps
a
log,
i
can't
see
that
the
prosecutor
would
lose
any
more
than
possibly
a
few
days
when
they
have
to
contact
the
prison
to
find
out
whether
the
prisoner
signed
it
or
not.
now,
they...
if
they
keep
track
of
these
things,
i
can't...
i
cannot
see
that
the
prosecutor
could
be
severely
hampered
in
adhering
to
the
180-day
rule,
and
if
there
is
a
reason
for
the
delay,
then
they
can
go
to
court
and
ask
for
a
continuance.
the
statute
provides
for
that.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
the
consequence
is
that
they
lose
jurisdiction
to
try
the
prisoner.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
the
consequence
of
burden--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes,
and
in
many
cases--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes.
but,
justice
scalia,
you
have
to
consider
whether...
who
has
the
control.
who's
in
charge
here?
the
prosecutor
has
control
over
the
situation,
and
the
prosecutor
can
control
whether
or
not
the
paperwork
gets
processed,
whether
the
prisoner
is
writted
from
the
one
state
to
the
other
and
whether
the
trial
takes
place
within
180
days.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
he
knows
that
the
detainer
has
been
sent
to
the
indiana
prison,
and
if
he
is
keeping
a
log,
he
knows
when
to
expect
the
return
of
the
request
for
disposition.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
if
the
inmate
is
going
to
sign
the
request
for
disposition,
he
probably
will
do
it
immediately,
and
the
prosecutor
could
operate
on
the
assumption
that
it's
going
to
come
back
and
at
least
start
the
initial
paperwork.
the
alternative
is
that
you
say
to
the
prison
officials,
well,
if
you
don't
send
it
back,
that's
okay
because
the
prosecutor
is
not
prejudiced
by
your
failure
to
return
the
request
for
disposition.
there's
just
no
control
whatsoever.
and
in
the
moore
case,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
there
is
an
intervening
detainer
that
is
processed
and
if
the
prisoner
goes
to
another
state
and
then
comes
back,
the
original
detainer
is
extinguished.
it
just
goes
away.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
i
think
if
they're
in
prison,
though,
the
motivation
is
all
the
other
way.
the
motivation--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--well,
certainly
in
this
case
and
in
a
large
majority
of
the
cases
that
i
have
read,
they
indicate
that
when
the
detainer
is
given
to
the
prisoner,
he
signs
it
immediately.
that
appears
to
be
the
case.
now,
that
was
not
the
case
in
moore.
if
i
remember
correctly,
debbie
moore
at
first
refused
extradition
and
then
someone
in
the
prison...
you
know,
a
prison
paralegal
clued
her
in
and
said,
you
know,
you
should
sign
the
request
for
disposition
and
file
it,
and
so
she
did.
but--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stevens.
the
attorney
general,
as
part
of
the
legislative
history
in
senate
report
91-1356,
says
article
3
of
the
agreement
provides
that
the
inmate
may
make
a
request
for
the
disposition
of
all
pending
charges
upon
which
detainers
are
based
by
applying
to
the
official
in
whose
custody
he
is
placed,
and
that
application
will
be
forwarded
to
authorities
of
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
charges
are
pending.
the
prisoner
must
be
brought
to
trial
within
180
days
thereafter.
and
the
excerpt
on
which
the
solicitor
general
relies
seems
to
indicate
that
the
180
days
starts
after
the
request
for
disposition
is
received
by
the
prosecutor.
i
believe
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
language
would
indicate
that...
or
treats
the
signing
of
the
request
for
disposition
and
the
transmittal
by
the
prison
authorities
as
one
event
which
triggers
the
180-day
time
limit
so
that
when
you
say
the
charges
on
which
detainers
are
based...
he
may
request
the
disposition
by
applying
to
the
official
in
whose
custody
he
is
placed.
i
think
there's
a
slightly
different
emphasis
there
than
on
the
excerpt
on
which
the
solicitor
general
relies.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
in
my
experience
or
in...
according
to
my
understanding,
there
is
no
penalty
on
the
sending
state
for
not
following
through.
the
only
real
control
that
we
have
here
is
the
receiving
state's
determination
to
bring
the
prisoner
to
trial,
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
consider
that
the
prison
authorities
and
the
prosecuting
authorities
are
going
to
work
very
well
together,
whereas
the
prisoner--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--as
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
remedy
for
that.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
the
statute
doesn't...
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
justice
o'connor,
because
it
would
be
more
time
consuming
than
would
be...
would
have
any
practical
effect
and
also
because
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
it.
i
can
imagine
a
section
1983
action
or
a
request
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
those
things
just
take
too
long,
and
i
can't
imagine
the
state
just
sitting
on
it
for,
you
know,
9
months
to
a
year.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
that.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
well,
that's
a...
he
wouldn't.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
he
wouldn't.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would...
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
to
differ
with
the
respondent.
the
prisoner
does
not
initiate
the
process
here.
the
prosecutor
initiates
the
process,
and
if
the
prosecutor
wants
to
take
control
of
the
process,
he
can
do
so
right
down
on
the
line.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
well,
the
detainer
may
have
been
filed.
in
this
case,
the
complaint
was
filed
before
the...
it
was
before
the
prisoner
was
convicted
and
sentenced.
however--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--well
the
complaint,
justice
scalia,
comes
from
the
same
place
as
the
detainer
would.
it
comes
from
the
jackson...
in
this
case,
from
the
jackson
county
prosecutor's
office.
it
just
happened
to
be
that
there
was
a
complaint
that
was
issued
before
the
prisoner
was
sentenced
in
indiana,
and
then
there
was
a
detainer
issued,
which
was
served
on
the
prisoner
on
september
7,
1988.
he
had
already
been
serving
his
sentence
for
some
time.
this
case--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--no,
justice
scalia,
because...
at
least
not
in
the--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
on
that.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
but
still
it
comes
from
the
prosecutor's
office,
and
the
prosecutor
doesn't
know--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--at
least
in
michigan,
the
complaint
would
have
to
be
signed
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
my
understanding
of
the
detainer...
now,
the
court
ruled...
has
ruled
that
a
probation
violation
is
not
a
detainer,
and
if
i
am
not...
it's
my
understanding...
now,
i
don't
work
for
the
prosecutor's
office,
and
i'm
not
completely
up
on
how
this
paperwork
is
processed.
but
it's
my
understanding
that
if
we
just
have
a
warrant,
that
a
warrant
would
not
constitute
a
detainer.
it's
only
after
the
prosecutor's
office
issues
a
complaint
or
an
indictment
or
a
detainer
that
we
actually
have
a
document
that
is
recognized
under
the
iad.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that,
as
justice
white
has
suggested,
that
when
the
prisoner
has
delivered
the
paperwork
to
the
prison
authorities,
he
has
caused
the
request
for
detainer
to
be
delivered.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
rule
in
the
only
way
that
does
not
eviscerate
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
if
you
rule
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
you
have
a
bright
line
test.
the
problem
of
competing
requests
for
detainer
can
be
dealt
with
in
the
way
that
the
paperwork
is
handled,
and
the
statute
provides
for
a
continuance
when
the
prisoner
unavailable.
it
does
not
affect
the...
a
prisoner-sent
request
for
detainer,
which
was
the
problem
in
a
number
of
cases
because
when
you
have
a
prisoner
sending
it
himself,
there
are
problems
in
proving
when
it
was
sent
and
proving
when
it
was
received.
but
it's
no
more
difficult
for
the
prosecutor
to
prove
when
the
prisoner
tended
the
request
for
disposition
to
the
prison
than
it
would
be
for
the
prisoner
to
prove
that...
when
the
prosecutor
received
it.
and
i
want
to
stress
that
we
are
talking
about
the
prisoner
tendering
the
request
for
disposition
to
the
agent
of
the
prosecutor
who
is
initiating
the
detainer
or
the
complaint
or
the
indictment.
and
the
prosecutor,
if
he
wants
to
do
so,
can
exert
perfect
control
over
when
the
paperwork
is
processed,
how
it
is
processed,
and
what
kinds
of
records
are
kept
in
order
to
ensure
that
it's
not
lost
along
the
way.
a
very
simple
log
will
ensure
that
we
don't
have
the
kinds
of
problem
that
we
have
here.
and--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--may
i
respond
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
in
this
case,
which
is
the
only
case
i've
had
direct
experience
with,
the
certificate
of
inmate
status
was
signed
by
superintendent
broglin
of
westville
correctional
center
the
same
date
that
my
client
signed
the
request
for--
mr.
john
b.
payne,
jr.
--yes,
in
indiana.
and
i
can't
see
that
that
would
be
a
problem.
