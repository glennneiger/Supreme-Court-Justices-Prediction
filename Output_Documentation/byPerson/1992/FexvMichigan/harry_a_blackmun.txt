mr.
payne,
are
you
familiar
with
a
case
up
here
not
too
long
ago
called
houston
against
lack?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
not
cited
in
your
brief.
i
commend
it
to
you
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it's
5

4
or
6
to
3?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
okay.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
respondent
strove
mightily
to
distinguish
houston
against
lack,
and
none
of
you
cite
it.
all
three
of
you
let
it
rest
in
limbo.
