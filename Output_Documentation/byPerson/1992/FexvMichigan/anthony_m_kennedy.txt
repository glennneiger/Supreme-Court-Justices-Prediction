if
a
state
were
routinely
remiss
in
processing
these
requests
quickly...
say
for
budgeting
reasons,
they
say,
well,
they
thought
iad's
are
taking
too
many...
too
much
time...
is
there
any
remedy
that
the
receiving
state
can
institute?
say
one
state
is
particularly
slow,
particularly
remiss.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
my
hypothetical
they
didn't.
then
there's
nothing
you
can
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
an
obligation,
as
you
understand
the
act,
to
send
a
second
detainer
once
the
judgment
becomes
in
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
you
fulfill
your
statutory
responsibilities
by
sending
it
to
the
jail
before
the
iad
even
comes
into
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
there's
a
duty
to
do
something
in
order
to
trigger
the
180-day
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
proper
procedure
under
the
act
to
file
the
detainer
with
the
jail
before
the
prison
commitment
begins?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
comes
to
into
effect
only
when
what?
there's
a
judgment
of
commitment
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
under
a
reading
of
the
act
that
you...
at
least
to
be
careful,
you
ought
to
file
a
second
detainer
after
the
judgment
so
that
this
act
can...
so
that...
at
least
so
that
the
prisoner
can
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
a
formal
detainer
has
been
filed.
