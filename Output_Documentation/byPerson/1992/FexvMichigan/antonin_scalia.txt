that
may
be
a
policy
argument,
but
it
may
be
that
the
language
of
the
statute
makes
it
an
argument
that
ought
to
be
addressed
in
the
congress.
i
mean,
it
does
say
caused
to
be
delivered,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin

what
if
you
knew
it
never
got
there
and
somebody
asked
you
the
same
question,
when
did
you
cause
it
to
be
delivered?
you
would
still
say
on
march
7,
even
though
it
was
never
delivered?
you'd
say
it
was

delivered.
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
what's
the
consequence
of
their
failure
to...
i
mean,
let's
assume
they
don't
do
it.
what
is
the
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
get
punished
for
that
offense
at
all.
right?
and
what's
the
consequence
of
putting
the
burden
the
other
way?
justice

that
the
prisoner
may
not
be
rehabilitated
for
up
to
a
couple
hundred
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
putting
those
two
risks
next
to
each
other,
it's
clear
to
me
which
one
is
greater.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
he
can't
cause
it
to
be...
he
cannot
possibly
cause
it
to
be
delivered
until
it
gets
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
cannot
possibly
cause
it
to
be
delivered
at
a
time
prior
to
when
you
know
it
has
been
delivered.
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
a
prosecutor
gets
it.
he
says
to
be
put...
you
know,
his
office
hits
a
receipt
stamp
on
it.
he
knows
he
has
to
count
180
days
from
then.
right?
otherwise,
he
would
have
to
try
to
figure
out
when
it
was
that
the
inmate
gave
it
to
the
warden
in
the
other
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
inmates
might
be
inclined
to
lie
about
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
they've
been
known
to
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
at
best
your
prosecution
would
be
subject
to
the
record
keeping
practices,
which
may
be
quite
slovenly,
of
somebody
in
another
state.
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
not
what
you
want
to
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
disagree
that
the
detainer
could
have
been
filed
before
the
sentencing?
it
could
have
been
filed
by
someone
other
than
the
prosecutor
before
the
sentencing.
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
but
you
say...
the
prosecutor
isn't
in
control
if
it
isn't
up
to
him
whether
this
whole
statute
shall
be
called
into
play
by
the
filing
of
a
detainer
which
is
the
first
step
that
triggers
it
or
that
lets
the
prisoner
trigger
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
complaint
can
be
filed
before
he
knows...
before
the
prosecutor
knows
that
the
person
is
even
arrested
anywhere
else.
right?
i
mean,
can't
that
be
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
statute
says
is
whenever
during
the
continuance
of
a
term
of
imprisonment,
there
is
pending
in
any
other
party
state
any
untried
indictment,
information,
or
complaint.
that
could
have
been
filed
long
before
the
imprisonment.
right?
it
just
has
to
be
still
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
yes,
but
he
doesn't
know
that
he's
triggering...
that
he's
beginning
anything
under
this
detainer
statute.
it
seems
to
me
the
only
state
action
that
you
can
say
consciously
invokes
the
detainer
statute
is
the
filing
of
a
detainer,
and
that...
is
your
colleague
incorrect
that
that
could
have
been
filed
by
a
police
department
instead
of
by
a
prosecutor?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
detainer.
the
detainer
could
be
put
on
by
a
police
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
text
here?
if
you
look
at
subsection
(a),
i
think
one
must
acknowledge
that
there
is
some
room
for
ambiguity
in
the
shall
have
caused
to
be
delivered
as
to
whether
you
look
to
the
place
of
causing...
to
the
time
of
causing
or
the
time
of
delivery.
but
if
you
skip
down
to
the
end
of
that
same
section,
the
last
sentence
says
the
request
of
the
prisoner
shall
be
accompanied
by
a
certificate
of
the
appropriate
official.
now,
that
last
sentence
is
obviously
taking
a
viewpoint
at
the
time
of
delivery.
certainly
at
the
time
he
makes
the
request,
at
the
time
he
gives
his
request
to
the
warden,
it
is
not
accompanied
by
this
document.
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
paragraph
is
looking
at
it
from
the
prosecutor's
receipt
point
of
view.
doesn't
it?

the
dispute
arises
out
of
a
detainer,
which
is
a
request
filed
by
a
criminal
justice
agency,
typically
a
prosecutor
with
the
institution
in

a
prisoner
is
incarcerated

indiana

michigan
along

46
other
states,
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
federal
government
are
parties
to
the
interstate
agreement
on
the
detainers.
article
iii(a)
of
that
agreement
provides
that
a
prisoner
of
one
state
who
is
the
subject
of
a
detainer
lodged
by
another
state
must
be
brought
to
trial
within
180
days
"after

shall

and
that
is
the
crucial
language,
"after

show

caused
to

to
the
prosecuting
officer
and
the
appropriate
court
of
the

mr.
fex
who
is
being
held
in
connection
with

offense
in
indiana.
a
michigan
prosecutor
lodged
the
detainer
against
them.
he
was
brought
to
trial
in
michigan
196
days
after
he
gave
his
request
for
final
disposition
of
the
charges
to
the
indiana
prison
authorities,
but
177
days
after
the
request
was
actually
received
by
the
michigan
prosecutor.
so
the
trial
was
within
the
prescribed
time
period
of
180
days
if
the
date
of
a
michigan
prosecutor's
receipt
was
what
started
the
clock
running,
but

period
if
the

the

court
taking
the
form,
if

denied
petitioners
motion
to

the
charges
against
him,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
set
fex's
conviction
aside.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
similarly
reversed.
in
an
opinion
of
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
according
to
the
statute
the
period
runs
from
the
time
of
a
prisoner
shall
have
caused
the
request
to
be
delivered.
it
is
self
evidently
true
that
no
one
can
have
caused
something
to
be
delivered
unless
delivery
in
fact
occurs.
so
we
can
readily
reject
petitioner's
contention
that
a
prisoner's
transmittal
of
his
request
to
the
indiana
authorities
commences
the
180-day
period
even
if
the
request
gets
lost
in
the
mail
and
never
riches
michigan
at
all.
the
text
could
bare
the
meaning
however,
that
once
delivery
has
been
made
180
days
must
be
computed
from
the
date
the
prisoner
caused
that
delivery.
in
our
view,
common
sense
indications
and
the
import
of
the
related
provisions
compelled
the
conclusion
that
the
180-day
period
does
not
commence
until
the
request
has
actually
been
delivered
to
the
prosecutor.
that
is
a
more
likely
choice
as
the
event
to
trigger
the
time
on
it,
because
it
occurs
at
a
relatively
identifiable
point
in
time.
causation
of
delivery
of
the
prosecutor
on
the
other
hand
could
be
deemed
to
delay
or
even
in
the
postal
service
is
delayed
in
forwarding
the
request,
it
will
nearly
result
in
a
prisoner's
spending
several
hundred
additional
days
under
detainer.
on
the
other
hand,
if
causation
is
the
trigger,
prosecution
for
a
major
crime
could
be
entirely
precluded
before
the
prosecutor
even
knows
it
has
been
requested.
additionally,
article
iii(b)
provides
the
documentary
evidence
of
the
time
of
receipt
by
requiring
the
use
of
registered
or
certified
mail
return
receipt
requested
but
it
nowhere
requires
a
record
of
when
a
prisoner
transmits
his
request
to
the
warden.
finally,
it
is
unlikely
that
if
transmittal
were
the
critical
event,
the
interstate
agreement
on
the
detainers
would
be
so
indifferent
as
to
the
manner
of
transmittal.
article
iii(b)
says
only
that
the
request
shall
be
"given
or
sent
by
the
prisoner
to
the
warden".
for
those
reasons,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
concurs.
