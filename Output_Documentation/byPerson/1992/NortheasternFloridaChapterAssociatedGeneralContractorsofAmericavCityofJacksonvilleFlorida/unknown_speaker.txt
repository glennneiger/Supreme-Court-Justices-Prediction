unknown
speaker
ms.
ausburn,
do
we
also
have
to
decide
whether
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it?
the
new
ordinance
is
rather
different,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
structure
it's
different
as
well,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
the
standing
analysis
would
be
different
under
the
new
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
has
your
complaint
been
amended
anywhere
down
the
line
to
address
the
new
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
so
as
it
comes
to
us,
anyway,
it
was
based
on
an
ordinance
that's
now
repealed.
unknown
speaker
ms.
ausburn,
our
judgments
don't
address
legal
issues.
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
the
legal
issue
that
you
raise
will
continue
to
be
there
under
the
new
ordinance,
maybe
in
somewhat
different
form,
but
courts
don't
address
legal
issues,
they
issue
judgments,
and
you're
essentially
asking
us
to
strike
down
a...
or
to
disallow
the
implementation
of
a
statute
which
no
longer
exists.
you're
asking
us
to
do
something
that's
a
useless
act,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
all
you're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit
on
the
standing
question.
you're
not
asking
us
to
decide
anything
on
the
merits,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course,
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
decide
any
questions
on
the
adequacy
of
the
pleadings,
and
there
was
no
question
about
your
ability
to
amend
your
complaint
because
they
invoked
the
standing
rule
to
dismiss
the
action.
unknown
speaker
was
the
ordinance
repealed,
and
then
a
new
one
enacted,
or
was
it
just
amended?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
for
a
minute?
is
the
difference
between
the
first
and
the
second
essentially
kind
of
an
empirical
difference
in
the
sense
that
you're
claiming
that
by
identifying
the
contractors
and
the
association
as
contractors
who
customarily
bid
on
a
range
of
contracts,
that
you
therefore
in
effect
have
identified
them
as
probably
harmed,
whereas
the
second
category
is
asking
simply
for
a
more
specific
demonstration,
or
a
more,
maybe
a
heightened
probability
of
harm?
is
that
the
difference
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
--in
your
complaint
specifically
says
that
many
of
your
members
would
have
bid.
unknown
speaker
well,
being
shut
out,
you
don't
really
say
that
being
shut
out
is
enough.
i
mean,
i
assume
that
contractors
in
seattle,
washington
are
shut
out,
too.
you
think
an
individual
contractor
in
seattle,
washington,
could
come
and
bring
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
so
being
shut
out
alone
is
not
enough.
unknown
speaker
but
the
city
identifies
in
advance
the
reserved...
at
least
under
the
old
ordinance
they
identified
in
advance
the
bids
that
were
reserved.
unknown
speaker
and
that's...
and
nonminority
contractors
are
shut
out
from
bidding
on
those--
unknown
speaker
--particularly
identified
contracts.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
representing
just
one
client
rather
than...
one
contractor
rather
than
association,
and
the
contractor
was
new
in
the
business,
had
never
bid
on
anything
whatsoever,
would
you
think
it
was
sufficient
for
you
simply
to
acclaim
that
your
client
would
have
bid
but
for
the
set-aside?
unknown
speaker
--allegation.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
our
language
in
warth
v
seldin,
where
we
denied
standing
to
the
homebuilders
saying,
"the
complaint
refers
to
no
specific
project
of
any
of
its
members
that
is
currently
precluded
by
the
ordinance?
"
remember,
this
was
an
ordinance
that--
unknown
speaker
"there
is
no
averment
that
any
member
has
applied
to
respondents
for
a
building
permit.
"
unknown
speaker
were
we
just...
why
were
we
saying
that?
unknown
speaker
your
clients
don't
have
any
separate
equal
protection
rights
here,
apart
from
the
contracts.
they're
not
complaining
of
some
violation
of
equal
protection
rights
in
the
abstract,
they're
complaining
about
denial
of
particular
contracts.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very
true,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
standing
question.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
are.
what
is
the
injury
you
are
alleging?
unknown
speaker
being
excluded
from
the
process?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that.
i
thought
you
were
complaining
about
not
being
able
to
get
contracts
with
the
city.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
difference
between
your
case
and
croson
in
the
sense
of
the
kind
of
injury
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
more...
more
proximate
in
your
case
than
it
was
in
warth,
then.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
not
so
much
the
kind
of
injury
but
the
likelihood
of
its
occurrence,
and
in
warth
v.
seldin
we
found
there
was
just
no
likelihood
shown
that
the
injury
would
ever
occur,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
should
be
the
distinction,
not
the
constitutional
basis
that
underlies
the
cause
of
action
for
asserting
the
injury.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
guess
that's
a
different
answer...
i
mean,
if
you
said
that
language
in
warth
may
go
too
far,
but
the
proximity
is
different,
that
language
aside...
but
that
language
seemed
to
say
not
just,
it
isn't
proximate
enough,
but
that
it
can't
be
proximate
enough
unless
you
will
identify
a
particular
contract.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
say
that
your
members
would
have
bid
on
these
contracts,
are
you
telling
us
that
we
should
read
that
allegation
to
mean,
in
effect,
that
they
would
have
bid
and
that,
given
the
large
number
of
them
and
the
fact
that
they
customarily
seek
contracts
for
this
kind
of
work,
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
one
of
them
would
have
gotten
at
least
some
of
these
set-aside
contracts?
are
you
telling
us
that's
the
way
we
should
read
that
allegation?
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
really
are
saying,
i
guess,
that
you're
not
complaining
of
economic
injury,
you
are
simply
complaining
of
kind
of
an
abstract
exclusion
from
a
bidding
process,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
weaker
than
read
your
allegations
to
be.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
complaining
of...
at
least,
i
didn't
think
you
were
complaining
of
a
mere
abstract
classification
which
excludes
you
from
a
bidding
process.
i
thought
you
were
complaining
of
an
exclusion
in
the
course
of
which
some
of
your
members
would
obtain
contracts.
unknown
speaker
so
ultimately
you
are
complaining
of
an
economic
injury,
and
the
debate
seems
to
be
how
specific
must
you
articulate
your
allegations
to
raise
a
probability,
or
a
claim
of
probability
of
actual
economic
injury.
that's
fair
to
say,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
whether
obtaining
a
particular
contract
is
a
necessity.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
court
below
insisted
that
you
prove
not
only
that
you
would
have
bid
for
the
contract,
but
that
you
would
have
gotten
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
ausburn.
mr.
magid.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
unknown
speaker
magid.
mr.
magid,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
some
sort
of
a
pleading
rule
that
would
require
alleging
with
particularity
economic
injury,
or
are
you
talking
about
a
substantive
rule
as
to
what
sort
of
a
showing
you
would
have
to
make
to
win
your
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment--
unknown
speaker
--against
the
city,
and
issued
a
preliminary
injunction.
unknown
speaker
and
a
permanent
injunction,
and
so
the
eleventh...
there
were
no
more
proceedings
to
be
had
in
the
district
court,
then.
unknown
speaker
and
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
because
of
no
showing
of
standing,
in
its
view.
so
why
are
we
talking
about
a
pleading
rule
if
the
case
went
on
summary
judgment
and
there
were
no
further
proceedings
to
be
had
in
the
district
court?
it
went
beyond...
it
had
gotten
beyond
the
pleading
stage
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
did
you
challenge
standing
at
that
stage?
unknown
speaker
until
the
appeal,
so...
and
now
you
complain
that
they
didn't
put
in
more
evidence
of
standing,
when
you
never
challenged...
surely,
at
least
in
those
circumstances
the
standard
we
should
apply
is
the
pleading
standard,
they
come
in
and
plead
something
that
would
show
enough
standing.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
changed
your
mind
now.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
deny
their
obligation,
but
i'm
just...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
apply
to
them
a
higher
standard
than
would
be
necessary
to
pass
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
when
you
have
never
at
any
point,
until
they're
in
the
court
of
appeals,
challenged
the
standing,
and
then
you
want
us
to
apply
the
test
that
ought
to
be
applied
either
at
summary
judgment
or
later
still,
at
trial.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
fair.
unknown
speaker
but
the
eleventh
circuit
orders
the
action
to
be
dismissed,
it
doesn't
remand
so
that
the
pleadings
can
be
amended.
unknown
speaker
is
it
without...
if
you
dismiss
someone
for
no
standing,
that's
without
prejudice?
you
can
come
back
in
the
next
day
and
say
oh,
i
really
do
have
standing,
i
just
didn't
allege
enough
facts.
you
can't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
a
decision
on
standing
has
no
res
judicata
effect.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
get...
if
this
further...
i
mean,
if
there
was
a
further
event,
but
not
if
you
simply
want
to
come
back
in
with
allegations
that
you
could
have
made
in
the
first
instance.
you
can't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
magid,
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
an
association
challenging
a
racially
exclusive
government
ordinance
may
establish
standing
by
showing
its
members
are
precluded
from
bidding
on
certain
municipal
contracts,
or
whether
the
association
must
show
that
its
members
actually
would
have
received
one
or
more
of
those
contracts.
that
is
a
question
of
substantive
standing
law,
not
pleading
law,
and
you
know,
you're
entitled
to
urge
affirmance
on
any
other
ground
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
suggest
that
you
do
discuss
somewhere
in
your
30
minutes
the
standing
question.
unknown
speaker
they
said
that
in
order
to
do
that
they
had
to
show
that
they
would
have
successfully
bid
on
contracts,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
magid,
suppose...
suppose
alaska,
having
a
budget
surplus
from
the
sale
of
the
state's
oil,
decides,
instead
of
dividing
it
up
among
all
our
citizens
we're
going
to
have
a
lottery.
this
will
be
much
more
exciting
and
will...
but
we
won't
give
everybody
in
the
state
a
lottery
ticket.
we'll
just
give
a
ticket
to
minorities
in
the
state.
or,
i
mean,
better
yet,
we'll
only
give
tickets
to
the
majority
in
the
state.
we
will
not
give
tickets
to
minorities.
now,
do
you
think
that
those
minorities
have
not
been
deprived
of
any
economic
benefit
because
they
cannot
prove
that
they
will
win
in
the
drawing?
those
tickets
will
sell
for
a
certain
amount
of
money,
won't
they?
the
tickets
will
be
worth
something.
i
mean,
that--
unknown
speaker
--that's
why
lottery
tickets
are
sold.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
whether
there's
any
economic
value
to
a
chance
of
getting
something.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
complaining
about
my
race
being
demeaned,
i'm
complaining
about
the
fact
that
i
don't
have
a
lottery
ticket,
which
is
worth
something,
isn't
it,
even
though
i
don't
know
for
sure
that
it's
going
to
win?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
if
i
know
it's
a
losing
lottery
ticket,
it's
worth
nothing.
[laughter]
but
at
the
outset
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
winner
or
loser,
just
as
here.
in
submitting
a
bid
you
don't
know
whether
you're
going
to
be
a
winner
or
loser,
but
it's
worth
something
to
be
able
to
submit
a
bid,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
nonsense.
assume
it
wasn't
upon
my
race,
it
was
upon
the
letter
of
the
alphabet
that
my
name
begins
with.
i'd
still
be
mad,
because
these
other
people
got
lottery
tickets
and
i
didn't.
i've
been
deprived
of
economic
value,
and
hasn't...
haven't
these
people
been
deprived
of
economic
value?
they
have
a
chance
of
getting
the
contracts.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
these
members
possibly
expect
to
win
a
contract
for
a
project
that's
listed
as
reserved
for
minorities?
how
can
the...
they
just
wouldn't
even
consider
the
bid.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
city
set
aside
certain
contracts
that
would
be
awarded
only
to
minorities?
unknown
speaker
and
so
what
should
somebody
do,
go
perform
a
futile
act,
a
nonminority...
you
go
bid,
and
certainly
how
could
you
ever
prove
that
you
would
have
gotten
the
contract
when
they're
reserved
for
minorities?
unknown
speaker
mr.
magid,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
isn't
it
also
an
allegation
in
the
case,
which
we
are
taking
as
true
at
this
point,
that
the
city
manager,
whoever
it
was,
identified
particular
contracts
as
subject
to
the
set-aside,
and
that
the
only
claim
that
these
people
are
making
is
that
as
to
those
contracts
they
were
excluded
from
bidding,
and
if
that
is
true,
then
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
waiver
provision
is
irrelevant
to
our
issue,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
there
was
no
waiver
as
to
those
identified
contracts.
unknown
speaker
no,
i...
that,
i
assume,
is
the
case
but
you
were
placing
some
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
city
can
waive
the
set-aside
requirement.
my
only
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
pleadings
here
include
a
claim
that
there
have
been
specific
contracts
as
identified
as
being
subject
only
to
minority
bids,
and
those
are
the
only
contracts
which
we
have
before
us,
and
if
that
is
so,
the
fact
that
there
could
have
been
a
waiver
is
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
willing
to
do
that,
and
i
still
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes,
and
why
we
should
consider
the
possibility
of
a
waiver
when
the
subject
matter
of
this
litigation
goes
to
contracts
which
have...
or
to
bids
as
to
which
there
has
been
no
waiver
of
the
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
just
a
question
about
allegations.
is
it
true,
or
is
it
not
true...
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
this...
that
the
allegation
is
that
as
to
specifically
identified
contracts,
i.e.,
those
which
are
set
aside
by
the
city
manager
as
being
subject
to
the
set-aside,
the
members
of
this
association
are
excluded
from
bidding,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
no
specific
contract,
i.e.,
the
contract
to
pave,
you
know,
west
rollins
street,
is
not
identified,
but
the
class
of
contracts
is
identified,
and
that
class
of
contracts
is
described
as
those
which
are
set
aside
by
the
city
which
are
identified
by
the
city
manager
as
subject
to
the
set-aside,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
asking
about
the
pleadings.
isn't
that
what
they've
pleaded?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
right,
i
understand
that,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
it.
it
just
doesn't
say
it
specifically.
it
says,
some
of
those
set
aside
we
would
have
bid
on,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
there's
no
matching,
you
mean
there's
no
matching
between
this
contractor
and
this
contract.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly...
certainly
it
very
likely...
it
should
at
some
stage
of
the
litigation,
if
you
say
you
can't
show
that
there
was
any
contract
you
were
excluded
from,
they
should
have
to
show
that
their
allegation
in
their
complaint
that
the
city
had
set
aside
certain
ones
was
true,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
focus
just
on
the
complaint
in
that
inquiry.
there
are
all
sorts
of
ways
in
litigation
to
bring
out
specific
answers
to
questions
that
may
have
to
be
asked
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
test
is
whether
that
allegation
is
sufficient
to
show
standing.
you
wouldn't
insist
that
in
a
separate
paragraph
of
the
complaint
the
plaintiff
would
say
the
plaintiff
had
standing,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
rule
8(a)
says
the
complaint
should
set
aside,
what,
a
short,
simple
statement
of
the
claim.
are
you
saying
there
must
be
a
different
rule
for
complaints
where
there
might
be
any
challenge
to
standing?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
attributable
to
the
fact
that
standing
was
never
raised
until
it
got
to
the
eleventh
circuit?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
another
question?
we've
talked
mostly
about
the
set-aside
of
10
percent
that
your
opponents
say
they
were
entirely
excluded
from
getting
contracts.
did
they
not
also
allege
that
even
as
to
the
contracts
they
got
they
had
an
obligation
under
the
ordinance
to
have
subcontracted
10
percent
of
that
work,
and
that
that
had
caused
them
extra
expense,
and
is
that
the
subject
of
a
different
analysis?
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
require
some
contracts
given
to
nonminority
contractors
to
have
10
percent
for
minority
contractors?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
they
did
allege
that
that
provision
of
the
ordinance
caused
them
to
make
subcontracts
that
were
less
advantageous
than
if
they'd
not
had
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
magid.
ms.
ausburn,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
