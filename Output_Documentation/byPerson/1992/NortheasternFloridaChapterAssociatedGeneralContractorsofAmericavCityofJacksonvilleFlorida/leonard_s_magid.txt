mr.
leonard
s.
magid
magid.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
on
standing
should
be
affirmed,
and
we
are
here
to
defend
that
decision,
because
it
correctly
held
the
agc
to
the
economic
injury
stated
in
its
complaint.
even
if
the
injury
is
found
to
be
noneconomic,
the
agc
failed
to
allege
such
injury
or
any
other
injury,
economic
or
noneconomic,
with
any
particularity
in
accordance
with
the
warth
case
and
others
of
this
court.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
initially,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
pleading
rule.
it's
a
pleading
rule
in
the
sense
that
from
the
complaint
it
must
appear
that
standing
is
present.
without
standing
being
present,
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
proceed
further.
that
is
why
we're
here
today,
because
the
allegations
in
the
agc
complaint
are
not
very
clear,
and
the
court...
at
least,
it
took
an
appellate
court
to
realize
that
the
case
should
not
have
proceeded
on
the
pleadings
alone,
and
of
course,
as
you
go
through
the
different
stages
of
the
case,
and
you
get
to
the
summary
judgment
stage
of
the
case,
that
rule
would
be
heightened
and
you
would
need
more
evidence,
and
we
were
at
that
stage
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
against
the
city.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
and
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
we
agree
with
you
wholeheartedly,
judge...
your
honor...
chief...
mr.
chief
justice.
even
if--
[laughter]
sorry...
i
got
it.
even
if
the
pleadings
are
found
to
be
sufficient,
we're
not
at
that
stage
in
this
case.
the
agc
failed
to
support
the
general
allegations
of
its
complaint
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
with
any
evidence,
and
again,
like
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
you
said,
the
case
had
already
gone
to
judgment.
it
seems
a
little
late
to
say
well,
we
can
show
you
we
should
have
been
here
in
the
first
place.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
your
honor,
we
never
challenged
standing
until
the
appeal.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
your
honor,
we
assumed
that
standing
was
present.
we
assumed
that
if
a
group
of
nonminority
contractors
were
challenging
a
minority
program,
that
you
basically
had
standing.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
correct.
the
eleventh
circuit...
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
has
an
obligation,
and
every
court...
and
it's
really
between...
almost
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
court.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
they
had
notice,
like
any
other
litigant,
that
standing
is
an
essential
element
of
their
case.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment.
when
they
moved
for
summary
judgment,
they
represented
to
the
court
that
the
court
should
grant
that
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
here's
all
our
evidence
that
we
need.
again,
they
had
notice
that
standing
is
an
essential
element
of
the
case,
but
they
did
not
submit
any
evidence
establishing
that
standing
for
the
court
to
rule,
for
the
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
to
render
a
ruling
and
to
exercise
its
lawful
authority
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
the
effect,
your
honor,
is
the
same.
the
case
was
dismissed
without
prejudice.
if
they
do...
in
fact
they're
able
to
show
an
actual
case
in
controversy,
they
can
be
back
at
our
doorstep
and
sue
us
tomorrow.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
your
honor,
i
think
the
decision
is
worded
that
it's
without
prejudice,
and
it
should
be
anyway
because
it
has
no
res
judicata
effect.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
as
to
showing
later
on
that
there
is
an
injury.
if
your
allegations
are
insufficient
and
you
lack
evidence,
tomorrow
you
may
have
an
actual
case
in
controversy.
the
problem
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--then,
your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
can
refer
to
is
the
decision
in
this
case.
it
is
without
prejudice.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
this
case
the
eleventh
circuit
has
not
established
a
new
rule
of
standing...
has
not
changed
anything
substantively
on
the
basis
of
constitutional
standing.
the
eleventh
circuit
does
not
require
litigants
challenging
an
affirmative
action
program
or
reverse
discrimination
to
show
a
denial
of
a
benefit
or
a
lost
contract.
in
this
case,
it
merely
required
the
plaintiff,
who
was
the
agc,
to
prove
specifically...
or
to
allege,
first
specifically,
and
then
to
establish
by
evidentiary...
by
evidence
that
standing
was
present.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
correct,
and
the
reason
the
eleventh
circuit
did
that
is
because
the
complaint
itself
states
the
injury
as
being
economic,
and
i
refer
you
to
paragraphs
48,
49,
and
52.
it
says,
we
were
harmed.
how
were
we
harmed?
we
were
harmed
because
we
lost
economically.
what
did
you
lose
economically?
we
lost...
lost
contracts.
so
the
eleventh
circuit
thereupon
said,
show
us
an
actual
case
in
controversy,
show
us
an
actual
concrete
case
in
this
matter
where
that
happened.
where
is
a
particular
project
that
you
lost,
and
they
didn't
plead
one,
they
didn't
submit
one
in
evidence
on
summary
judgment,
and
therefore
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled
against
them,
and
it
was
no
new
rule
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
right.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
your
honor,
in
your
example,
race
is
an
absolute
barrier
to
their
participation.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
the
injury
in
that
case,
in
your
example,
is
not
an
opportunity,
it's
very--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--even
a
losing
lottery
ticket.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
injury
that
you're
stating
in
your
complaint,
your
hypothetical
complaint,
is
an
injury
more
of
a
racial
stigma,
of
a
personal
indignity,
saying
i'm
not
allowed
to
have
that
lottery
ticket
based
upon
my
race.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
they've
been
deprived
of
economic
value,
but
again,
they
state
in
their
complaint
that
their
injury
is
economic,
and
their
injury
is
economic
because,
again,
if
read
paragraphs
48,
49,
and
52,
their
injury
is
that
we
lost
business.
not
that
we
lost
the
right
to
participate
in
the
system,
but
that
we
lost
a
contract.
that's
why
they're
here.
they're
here
because
they
claim
that
they
have
not...
they
are
unable
to
win
certain
contracts
let
by
the
city,
but
we
don't
know
which
ones.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
this
relates...
your
question,
your
honor,
relates
to
the
imminence
of
the
injury.
in
order
to
warrant
a--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--yes,
but
it
is--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--well,
facially
on
the
record,
your
honor,
and
the
ordinance
is
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record,
we
don't
have
any
bid
specifications,
and
if
you
look
at
the
ordinance,
the
ordinance
specifically
has
a
waiver
provision.
the
ordinance
is
not
a
quota.
it's
not
an
absolute
bar.
it
does
not
state
that
10
percent
of
the
city
of
jacksonville
contracts
will
be
let
to
a
certain
class
of
people.
it
says,
that
is
the
city's
goal.
in
fact,
an
application
much...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
also
is
a
gender
classification
in
the
ordinance
that
is
not
challenged
by
the
agc,
and
the
ordinance
can
let
all
the
contracts
under
the
ordinance
to
women-owned
businesses.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
well,
your
honor--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--but
again,
the
complaint
does
not
identify
the
particular
contracts
that
the
city
might
set
aside
in
the
future.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
i
would
submit
to
you,
your
honor,
that
provision
has
to
be...
that
allegation
should
be
read
in
context
with
the
evidence,
which
is
the
ordinance,
and
the
ordinance--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--well,
your
honor,
again,
that
is
the
problem
with
this
case,
is
that,
like
the
warth
case,
there
is
no
particular
project.
we
don't
know
from
the
complaint--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--it
is
uncertain
from
the
pleading
in
that
no
particular
contract
is
identified--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--but
it's
unclear
that--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--your
honor,
no,
because
it
is
unclear
from
the
ordinance
itself
whether--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--they
have
alleged...
correct,
your
honor.
they
have
alleged
generally
that
they
have
been
precluded
in
the
past
from
certain
business.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
however,
the
ordinance
itself
does
not
state
whether
the
particular
projects
that
they
might
be
interested
in
have
ever
been
set
aside
or
will
be
set
aside
in
the
future.
it
doesn't
say,
construction
contracts,
or
within
the
area
of
construction
contracts,
electrical
contracts,
plumbing
contracts,
whatever
contracts--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--so
there's
no
matching,
so
there's
no...
we
don't
know
if--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
and
also...
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
there
is
a
contradiction
facially
with
the
ordinance.
the
ordinance
allows
the
waiver
provision,
and
allows
them
to
bid.
it
doesn't
preclude
them
from
bidding,
and
again
that
10
percent
is
no
absolute
bar.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
they
sued
as
an
association,
and
as
an
association
they
may
sue
as
a
representative
of
its
members,
but
the
associational
standing
does
not
negate
the
requirement
that
you
have
actual
case
in
controversy.
a
representative
standing
case
or
an
association
can't
hide
behind
its
associational
standing.
the
general
allegations
of
the
complaint
that
our
members
are
suffering
under
this
ordinance
are
unsupported
even
in
the
complaint,
in
the
complaint
and
later
on
in
summary
judgment,
with
any
specific
instance,
and
like
any
other
litigant
an
association
should
have
to
come
forward
and
show
a
specific
instance
of
actual
case
in
controversy
so
the
court...
a
court
doesn't
find
itself
in
a
situation
where
we
are
today.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
the
only
thing
i
would
refer
you
to,
your
honor,
is
that
of
course,
as
you
get
through
the
stages
of
the
litigation
like
the
lujan
case
specifically
talked
about,
you
have
a
higher
threshold
of
evidence
to
show
the
court
that
you
fulfilled
the
obligation,
and
you
can
assure
the
court
that
there
was
an
actual
case
in
controversy.
however,
there's
a
case...
bender
v.
williamsport...
where
the
court
talks
in
language
of
any
doubt
that
that
actual
case
in
controversy
is
present
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
not
allowing
a
case
to
proceed,
or
the
presumption
is
that...
the
presumption
is
that
actual
case
in
controversy
is
not
present.
based
upon
those
very...
the
law
is
exacting
when
it
comes
to
standing.
based
upon
those
opinions,
we
would
submit
to
you
that
you
should
put
it
in
your
pleadings
and
specifically
allege,
and
put
the
court
on
alert,
that
you
have
standing.
if
you
continually...
if
litigants
continually
to
allege...
continue...
associations
continue
to
allege
our
members
are
hurt
generally,
a
court
can't
be
satisfied
that
standing
is
present.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
no.
that
would
be
a
general
conclusory
allegation
and
of
course
would
be
insufficient,
but
something
to
say
here
is
our
actual
case,
here
is
the
elements
of
our...
here
is
a
particular...
like
warth
suggested,
here
is
a
particular
project.
we
are
injured
because
in
this
particular
project
company
a
was
minimally
eligible
to
bid,
the
city
was
going
to
set
aside
that
project,
we
bid,
we
didn't
get
it.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor...
mr.
chief
justice,
sorry...
that
when
it
comes
to
standing,
standing
is
such
a
critical
doctrine
that
goes
to
the
separation
of
powers,
of...
and
the
lawful
exercise
of
the
court's
authority,
that
when
it
comes
to
that
doctrine,
that
standing
should
be
evident
from
the
face
of
the
pleadings,
and
conclusory
allegations
alone
put
us
in
a
situation
where
we
are
here,
where
a
case
actually
went
to
judgment
and
there
is
no
record
evidence
that
at
least
one
agc
member
in
one
instance
has
ever
been
injured
by
the
ordinance.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
partly,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
i
mean...
well,
wholly,
but
the
idea
is
that
if
there
was
a
pleading
rule,
that
it
should
be
from
the
face
of
the
pleadings
that
it
should
appear,
and
i
think
there
is
some
language
in
bender
v.
williamsport
that
it
should
appear
from
the
pleadings
that
presumptively...
the
presumption
is
that
it
doesn't
exist,
so
you
must...
when
you
have
to
overcome
a
presumption,
there's
something
more
you
would
have
to
do
than
just
do...
cite
conclusory
allegations.
and
i
know
there's
a
conflict
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
when
it
comes
to
rule
8,
but
standing
is
so
important,
and
there's
a
presumption
that
a
court...
at
the
minimum,
a
court
at
the
pleading
stage
would
dismiss
the
case
and
say,
you
know...
not
dismiss
the
case,
dismiss
the
pleading,
and
allow
you
to
replead.
but
again,
in
this
case
we
have
gone
to
the
summary
judgment
stage,
and
when
you're
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
and
you
move
for
summary
judgment,
you're
on
notice
that
that
standing
element
is
present.
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
your
honor,
i'm
aware
of
the
allegation
that
you're
reading.
the
ordinance
does
not
suggest...
actually,
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
that
all
city
contracts
require
10
percent
subcontracts.
the
ordinance
itself
does
not
require
all
contracts
be...
have
10
percent
participation
of
minorities.
there's
no
place
in
the
ordinance
that
requires--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
10
percent.
it
leaves
it
open
as
to
what
the
percentage
might
be.
the
provision
that
you're
referring
to--
mr.
leonard
s.
magid
--right,
your
honor,
but
that
allegation,
again
there
is...
on
its
face,
and
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
has
stated
this
previously,
that
an
allegation
that
it
costs
you
more
to
hire
somebody
else,
you're
just
going
to
pass
it
on
in
your
bid,
anyway.
i
mean,
everybody
has
the
same
equal
playing
field.
as
a
general
contractor
you're
trying
to
meet
your
subcontracting
requirements
and
therefore
it's
not
going
to
cost
anybody
anybody...
anything
extra,
so
there
is
no
economic
injury
for
that
alone.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
litigants
and
lawyers
and
courts
need
to
be
reminded
that
sometimes...
that
they
are
blinded
by
the
ultimate
ends
a
lawsuit
might
bring,
and
in
this
case
the
litigant's
zealousness
to
stop
a
government
program
that
they
did
not
like,
did
not
wait
for
the
time
when
an
actual
case
had
arisen.
the
fact
that
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
court
only...
or
the
appellate
court
in
this
case,
only
underscores
the
importance
of
the
standing
doctrine
to
the
court's
lawful
exercise
of
its
authority.
the
agc
in
this
case
rushed
to
court
after
the
croson
decision
attempting
to
halt
the
city's
program,
and
successfully
did,
without
ever
showing
that
an
actual
case,
an
actual
instance
where
one
agc
member
was
injured
during
the
5
years
of
the
existence
of
the
program,
and
they
were
able
to
get
an
opinion
that
now
stands
as
an
advisory
opinion
because
there's
no
record
of
evidence
in
that
record,
even
though
the
case
had
gone
to
judgment,
that
there
is
an
actual
case
in
controversy.
in
conclusion,
conclusory
allegations
of
injury
are
not
sufficient
to
establish
constitutional
standing.
without
allegations
of
specific
injury,
a
court
cannot
be
assured
that
standing
is
present
and
that
it
should
resolve
a
dispute
between
the
parties.
relaxing
standing
doctrine
would
only
upset
the
delicate
balance
of
power
among
the
branches
of
government,
expand
judicial
power
unnecessarily,
and
sanction
advisory
opinions.
the
court
in
this
case,
the
appellate
court
in
this
case
provided
a
check,
and
if
that
check
is
not
fulfilled,
the
legitimacy
of
the
court
can
ultimately
be
undermined.
thank
you.
