ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
4
years
ago
my
clients
filed
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
an
ordinance
passed
by
the
city
of
jacksonville,
florida.
today,
the
question
is
before
this
court
of
whether
nonminority
contractors
who
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville
have
standing
to
challenge
an
ordinance
that
excludes
nonminority
contractors
who
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville
from
consideration
for
certain
city
contracts.
there
are
before
this
court
three--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--yes,
your
honor,
that
issue
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
the...
as
we
discussed
in
our
briefs,
the
city
has
repealed
the
ordinance
that
was
originally
challenged.
however,
it
did
not
simply
repeal
that
ordinance,
it
repealed
it
and
replaced
it
with
another
ordinance
that
for
purposes
of
standing
is
identical.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
your
honor,
the
city
claims
that
it
is
different
in
the
fact
that
it
is
supported
by
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
city
council
before
the
ordinance
was
enacted.
that,
however,
is
not
in
the
record,
and
frankly
we
will
not
know
until
someone
has
standing
to
challenge
that
ordinance
and
obtain
court
review.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor.
rather
than
being
a
simple
set-aside
which
the
original
ordinance
was,
this
new
ordinance
has
five
different
ways
of
granting
preferences
along
racial
lines.
there
are
set-asides,
there
are
bid
preferences,
there
are
direct
negotiations,
there
are
subcontracting
requirements.
the
different--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--your
honor,
it
might
be
that
in
some
instances
there
would
be
a
question
of
subcontracting
requirements
of
whether
there
were
contractors
who
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
subcontracting
requirements,
which
is
not
an
issue
under
the
old
ordinance.
however,
for
purposes
of
the
fact
that
nonminority
contractors
come
into
the
bidding
process
with
a
distinct
disadvantage
for
a
certain
percentage
of
city
contracts,
that
standing
analysis
would
be
the
same
under--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--no,
your
honor,
the
case
has
been
dismissed
because
of
the
standing
issue.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor,
although
i
would
use
the
word,
replaced
with
another
substantially
similar
and,
for
purposes
of
standing,
identical
ordinance.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
it
is
far
from
clear
in
this
case
that
the
injunction
which
the
district
court
entered
in
this
case
originally
almost
3
years
ago...
it
is
far
from
clear
whether
that
permanent
injunction
does
not
cover
the
new
ordinance.
the
court's
injunction
stated
that
the
city
was
free
to
reenact
constitutional
ordinance
that
met
this
court's
guidelines
in
city
of
richmond
v.
croson.
it
is
no
more
than
an
assertion
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
jacksonville
that
this
new
ordinance
meets
the
city
of...
the
guidelines
of
croson
and
therefore
meets
the
terms
of
the
original
injunction.
if
it
were
not
for
the
standing
issue,
your
honor,
either
party
could
go
back
to
the
court
under
the
original
injunction
and
ask
the
court
to
review
this
new
ordinance
under
the
same
standards
and
under
the
same
legal
issues
that
were
presented
4
years
ago.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
however,
no
one
can
do
this
until
someone
has
standing.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
no,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
on
the
merits
that
has
been
preserved
in
this
case
through...
from
the
district
court
through
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
decide
the
merits
of
the
old
ordinance,
and
the
merits
of
the
new
ordinance
have
never
been
challenged.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor.
they
invoked
the
standing
rule,
ordered
it
dismissed
on
the
basis
that
our
pleadings
did
not
allege
sufficient
facts
that
they
believed
to
be
required
for
standing
in
this
case.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
it
was
repealed
and
replaced.
the
beginning
of
the
ordinance...
i
believe,
your
honor,
at
the
very
beginning
it
said
that
they
repealed
section
6
of
the
city
of
jacksonville
purchasing
code
and
replaced
it
with
this
following
section
6,
so
the...
a
new
part
section
6
is
added
to
the
code,
i
believe
is
the
exact
language.
so
the
new
ordinance
is
in
exactly
the
same
place
that
the
old
one
was.
it
is
part
of
the
code.
it
uses
the
same
statutory
citations
and
for
that
purpose
we've
argued
that
the
case
is
not
moot
on
those
grounds.
the
question
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
which
is
standing
and
whether
a
group
of
nonminority
contractors
have
standing
based
on
the
pleadings
that
were
present
in
this
record,
there
have
been
three
particular
standards
that
have
been
identified
to
this
court
for
determining
that
standing
issue.
the
first
one
is
the
rule
adopted
by
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
apparently
no
party
before
this
court
is
defending
any
longer,
and
that
is
that
the
contractors
must
identify
a
specific
bid
and
a
specific
contract
that
was
lost
due
to
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance.
the
second
rule
that
was
presented
is
the
city
of
jacksonville's
latest
proposal,
which
is
that
the
contractors
need
not
show
that
we
actually
lost
a
contract,
we
need
only
show
that
we
specifically
bid
for
an
ordinance.
and
then
the
third
standard
is
that
submitted
by
petitioners
in
this
case,
which
is
that
the
statute
creates
a
racial
preference
that
disadvantages
certain
parties
and
that
we
are
within
that
category
of
people
who
are
disadvantaged.
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
it
is
this
last
rule
is
the
only
one
that
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent
in
both
standing
and
equal
protection
law.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
the
categorical
rule
which
petitioners
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt
stems
from
a
number
of
cases,
such
as
baker
v.
carr,
quinn
v.
millsap
and
others,
which
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
access,
it
does
not
protect
what
the
eleventh
circuit
asks
the
injury
to
be.
it
does
not
protect
actually
getting
a
contract,
it
does
not
protect
actually
being
able
to
perform
the
contract,
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
access
to
the
system,
and
that
when
a
party
does
not
have
complete
and
fair
access
to
the
system,
and
that
access
is
conditioned
on
an
unconstitutional
barrier,
that
is
the
injury,
and
that
is
sufficient
injury
for
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
the
second
rule,
which
is
the
latest
version,
has...
sounds
more
perfectly
reasonable
that
you
have
to
identify
a
bid.
however,
it
is
an
unnecessary
addition
to
the
law
of
equal
protection,
or
the
law
of
standing,
and
it
is
not
consistent
with
this
court's
rulings
in
prior
cases
such
as--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--it
could
be
looked
at
as
that
difference,
your
honor.
we
would
argue
that
our
allegations
in
this
case
show
sufficient
probability.
we
have
alleged
that
we
are
contractors
who
regularly
bid
on
and
perform
contracts
for
the
city
of
jacksonville,
that
we
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville
on
a
regular
basis,
that
there
are
contracts
that
we
would
have
bid
for
but
we
were
not
eligible
for--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
in...
it
is
in
paragraph
46
of
our
complaint,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix...
joint
appendix
page
18,
"numerous
nonminority
members
of
agc
have
been
eligible
and
would
have
bid
on
contracts
but
for
the
set-aside
program.
"
we
also
allege
that
there...
as
long
as
the
set-aside
program
is
in
effect,
that
we
are
shut
out
from
these.
the
requirement
of
a
specific
bid
arguably
would
heighten
the
probability,
but
it
is
the
sort
of
mechanical
requirement
that
becomes
simply
a
pleading
requirement,
and--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--only
if
he
proved
that
he
does
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville
and
would
like
to
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
no,
your
honor.
there
is
some
requirement
that
you
be
within
the
group
of
people
affected
by
the
ordinance,
and
the
ordinance
only
affects
those
people
who
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor,
under
both
the
old
ordinance,
and
i
believe
under
the
new
ordinance,
the
set-aside,
or
the
contracts
that
are
reserved
are...
it
is
included
within
the
bid
specifications
that
these
contracts
would
be
let
only
to
minority
bidders.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor.
i
suppose
in
a
technical
sense
we
could
bid
for
the
contracts.
we
simply
would
not
be
considered,
and
that
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
city
of
jacksonville's
standard,
is
that
they
are
asking
our
contractors
to
bid
for
contracts
that
on
its
face
our
contractors
are
not
eligible
for.
they
are
requiring
a
futile
act
in
order
to
prove
standing,
which
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases,
including
criminal
law
standards,
that...
to
analogize
to
criminal
law,
that
a
person
need
not
submit
themselves
to
a
threat
of
prosecution
in
order
to
have
challenge...
in
order
to
have
standing
to
challenge
a
law
that
criminalizes
some
behavior
unconstitutionally.
this
court
has
also
held
in
many
cases
that
an
impending
injury
is
enough,
and
that
if
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
or
in
our
case
allegations
in
the
complaint
of
an
impending
injury,
in
our
case
the
contractors
who
would
have
bid
on
these
contracts
and
who
would
like
to
bid
on
these
contracts,
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
pleading
that
this
court
found
adequate
in
clemments
v.
fashing,
which
was
a
statute
that
required
politicians
in
texas
to
resign
from
a
current
office
in
order
to
run
from
another
office.
this
court
did
not
require
those
people
to
actually
go
and
run
for
office
or
apply
to
be
a
candidate
for
the
office.
the
court
simply
held
that
the
allegations,
which
were
that
they
would
like
to
run
and
would
run
if
it
weren't
for
the
fact
that
they
had
to
resign
from
their
current
office,
was
sufficient
to
give
them
standing
to
challenge
that
resign-to-run
provision.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
your
honor,
there
might
be
a...
with
the
individual
contractor
there
might
be
a
heightened
element
of
evidence
in
order
to
prove
that
he
would
have
bid,
and
that
would
come
down
to
the
difference
between
allegations
and
evidence
submitted
at
summary
judgment
in
order
to
prove
that.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
i
would
believe,
your
honor,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
standing
and
to
get
the
case...
to
get
the
case
into
court
so
that
those
allegations
could
be
tested.
there
would
be
all
sorts
of
evidence
required
that
this
person
was
competent
to
perform
contracts
for
the
city
of
jacksonville,
that
he
was
otherwise
eligible;
there
would
be
many
issues,
but
those
would
be
evidentiary
proof
issues
rather
than
pleadings
issues
for
allegations.
the
question
of
what...
whether
a
person
would
have
to
submit
a
bid,
that
second
test
that
has
been
presented
to
this
court
is
not
one
that
is
necessary
to
protect
the
principles
that
are
at
issue
in
standing
cases.
this
court
has
stated
that
the
issue
in
standing
cases
is
whether
you
have
the
proper
plaintiff
before
the
court,
a
plaintiff
who
is
likely
to
be
injured,
a
plaintiff
who
is
concerned
about
what
is
happening
in
this
case.
we
would
submit
that,
on
the
basis
of
our
allegations,
that
we
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville,
that
we
would
like
to
continue
to
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville,
that
you
have
the
proper
plaintiffs
before
this
court.
after
all,
the
ordinance
is
directed
towards
contractors
who
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville,
and
if
we
can
prove
we
are
within
that
category,
then
there
is
no
one
else
that
is
going
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
ordinance,
other
than
people
within
that
category.
the
third
rule
is
the
one
that
this
court
originally
granted
cert
on,
which
is
the
eleventh
circuit
rule
requiring
proof
of
an
actual
contract.
we
believe
that
the
eleventh
circuit
confused
the
standards
for
standing
in
equal
protection
cases
with
the
standards
at
issue
for
a
bid
protest
or
your
standard
civil
suit
where
damages
are
sought,
and
for
all
the
reasons
contained
in
our
brief
we
believe
that
injunctive
relief,
and
particularly
injunctive
relief
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
does
not
require
proof
of
a
specific
lost
contract
but
simply
being
allowed
to...
or,
excuse
me,
not
being
considered
or
not
being
able
to
compete
on
an
equal
basis
is
sufficient.
the
finally
issue
that
has
arisen
in
the
briefs
is
the
level
of
evidence
that
is
required.
the
posture
of
this
case
is
that
everything
about
standing
has
been
decided
on
the
pleadings.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
our
clients
submitted
a
bid
and
were
refused,
or
that
they
would
have
gotten
a
contract.
the
reason
we
believe
that
this
court
should
focus
on
the
allegations
and
determine
whether
the
allegations
are
sufficient
for
standing
is
because
in
many
cases,
this...
or
in
most
cases
where
the
court
has
focused
on
the...
considered
standing,
they
have
focused
on
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
unless,
if
standing
came
up
as
an
issue
in
the
lower
courts,
in
the
issue
of
summary
judgment
or
in
other
standards,
then
this
court
has
considered
that
the
nonmoving
party
or
the
party
plaintiff
who
has
proved
standing
has
had
adequate
notice.
celotex
is
an
example
where
this
court
made
a
point
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
not
presented
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
her
pleadings,
but
that
she
had
sufficient
notice,
and
all
of
these
cases...
many
of
these
cases
that
the
court
has
considered
have
used
language
that
if
it
is
contested
at
trial,
if
the
question
is
brought
up...
in
lujan,
the
language
was,
in
response
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
evidence
is
needed.
there
was
no
such
motion,
there
was
no
such
notice
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
question
never
came
up
until...
as
i
believe
the
briefs
adequately
show,
the
question
never
came
up
until
6
months
before
this
case
came
up
on
appeal
when
the
eleventh
circuit
adopted
its
new
rule
and
then
applied
it
in
this
case.
this
court
has
never
dismissed
pleadings
or
never
decided
a
case
on
standing
for
lack
of
evidence
unless
there
was
notice
in
the
lower
courts
that
this
has
come
up.
in
this
case,
the
city
of
jacksonville
never
raised
the
issue.
in
fact,
at
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
when
the
judge
asked
them
if
they
were
claiming
that
we
had
no
standing,
they
said
no.
the
issue
of
bids
and
being
denied
for
a
bid
went
to
irreparable
injury
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
which
was
the
issue
at
that
time
4
years
ago,
when
we
sought
preliminary
injunction.
the
issue
of
injury
and
requiring
a
bid
has
never
been
an
issue
in
this
case
until
the
eleventh
circuit's...
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
its
decision.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes.
your
honor,
the--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--yes.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
well,
because
in
warth
v.
seldin,
that
was
the
only
injury
that
those
homeowners...
that
those
homebuilders
could
allege,
was
economic
injury.
they
were
not
the
targets,
or
they
were
not
suffering
any
discrimination
as
a
result
of
that
zoning
ordinance.
the
injury
that
the
homebuilders
were
alleging
was
indirect
injury,
injury
to
them
resulting
from
the
violation
of
someone
else's
rights.
it
was
the
rights
of
the
people
to
live
in
that
community,
the
other
rights.
they
had
no
equal
protection
rights
for
discrimination,
and
it's
that
distance,
there,
that
economic
injury
was
all
that
they
could
claim,
and
therefore
this
court
rightly
went
back
to
the
standard
for
damages
in
the
case.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
statute
has
created
racial
classifications
and
has
put
our
clients
within
those
racial
classifications.
in
warth
v.
seldin
the
homeowners...
excuse
me,
the
homebuilders
association,
none
of
their
clients
were
classified
and
directly
affected--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--your
honor,
the...
again,
i
would
go
back
to
the
injury
that
they
were
claiming--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--in
warth
was
not
related
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
injury
to
those
particular
plaintiffs
was
purely
economic.
in
our
case,
we
are
alleging
more
than
economic
injury.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
the...
the...
being
excluded
from
the
process.
that
encompasses--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--yes,
your
honor,
being
excluded
from
consideration.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
we're
not
even
considered
for
contracts.
it
is
true
that
what
we're
looking
at
is
economic,
that
it
is
the
contracts,
but
i
believe
there
is
a
difference
between
the
contracts
and
saying
that
it
is
all
economic
injury.
i'm
not
denying
that
there
is
economic
injury
in
this
case
and
that
if
it
is
only
economic
injury
then
you
must
quantify
it
to
the
extent
of
damages.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
your
honor,
the
injury
that
this
court
identified
in
croson
was
the
injury
of
not
being
considered...
or
being
lumped
in
a
category
because
of
racial
preferences
and
not
being
allowed.
we
would
put
ourselves
in
the
croson
category
as
opposed
to
the
warth
v.
seldin
category,
because
we
are
directly
affected
by
the
statute
and
it
is
our
directly
equal
protection
rights
that
are
being
affected.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
your
honor,
we're
saying
that
the
injury,
the
equal
protection
injury
is
more
proximate
to
us
than
it
was
in
warth.
they
had
no
equal
protection
injury
in
warth
v.
seldin.
all
that
they
had
was
economic
injury.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
that
is
true,
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
in
warth
between
the
proximity.
we
look
to
the
equal
protection
clause
not
to
determine
proximity,
we
simply
look
to
the
equal
protection
clause
to
determine
the
injury
that
is
acceptable,
and
that
is
the
main
area
of
disagreement
that
we
have
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
argument.
they
looked
at
the
only
injury
that
is
acceptable
is
economic
injury.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
warth
requires
people
who
suffer
equal
protection
injury
to
prove
a
bid
or
to
show
that
they
had
submitted
themselves
to
the
process,
then
warth
is
not
consistent
with
this
court's
prior
holdings
in
standing
and
equal
protection,
because
there
are
many
cases
where...
the
voters
in
baker
v.
carr
did
not
have
to
show
that
they
had
actually
voted.
the
plaintiffs
in
gilmore,
where
they
were
excluded
from
the
parks,
they
didn't
have
to
show
that
they
had
gone
out
and
tried
to
enter
the
parks.
all
they
had
to
show
is
that
the
ordinance
said
only
these
people
are
allowed
in
the
parks,
and
you
are
not
one
of
these
people.
and
warth
v.
seldin,
we
believe
that
the
only
way
to
reconcile
it
with
the
other
cases
is
to
make
the
difference
between
the
rights
that
are
asserted
and
the
proximity
in
this
case.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
certainly
you
can
read
that,
your
honor.
we
do
not
believe
that
it's
necessary
for
there
to
be
at
the
end
of
any
chain
of
reasoning
a
decision
that
someone
would
have
gotten
a
contract.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
we--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
true
and
that
it
can
be
read
that
way.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
our
clients
would
not
be
bidding
for
contracts
if
they
didn't
think
they
could
get
them.
they
are
in
business,
and
they
would
like
to
perform
contracts
and
be
paid
for
performing
those
contracts.
however,
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
performing
the
contracts,
receiving
the
contracts,
is
a
necessity,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
certainly--
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
--is
a
necessity
for
standing.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
can
find
from
our
pleadings
that
certainly
someone
within
the
association
of
general
contractors
is
going
to
be
performing,
or
is
going
to
receive
and
perform
adequately
a
contract
for
the
city
of
jacksonville.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
but
for...
again,
it
was
a
simple
damages
type
of
analysis
that
they
applied
to
this
case,
and
given
all
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
only
standard
that
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent,
and
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents
in
both
the
equal
protection
clause
and
standing,
is
the
standard
that
our
allegations
meet,
which
is
that
the
city
of
jacksonville
passed
an
ordinance
that
affects
contractors
who
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville,
and
we
do
business
with
that
city.
thank
you.
ms.
deborah
a.
ausburn
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
standard
that
the
city
of
jacksonville
would
have
this
court
use
is
one
that
imposes
evidentiary
standards
on
pleading
requirements.
we
believe
that
our
allegations
are
sufficient
to
show
that
we
were
excluded
from
contracts
because
of
an
ordinance
that
was
adjudicated
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
that
we
will
continue
to
be
excluded
from
those
contracts.
if
this
court
believes
that
more
evidence
is
necessary,
we
are
prepared,
certainly,
to
present
that.
we
would
simply
ask
that
this
court
decide
what
it
is
that
we
must
show
in
the
lower
court,
whether
we
must
show
a
specific
contract,
or
whether
we
must
show
the
matching
contracts
that
the
city
of
jacksonville
is
asking
for.
in
the
final
analysis,
however,
we
believe
that
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
prior
precedent,
that
the
correct
rule
in
this
case
is
the
one
that
we
have
already
met,
which
is
that
the
city
of
jacksonville
has
an
ordinance
that
excludes
contractors
from
consideration
if
they
fit
within
the
category,
and
that
we,
as
nonminority
contractors
who
do
business
with
the
city
of
jacksonville,
are
within
that
category.
thank
you.
