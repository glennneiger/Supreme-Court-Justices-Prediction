that's
interesting
because
for
the
federal
officer,
it's
a
separate
offense
to
lie
to
a
federal
officer
during
an
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
guidelines
say
that
before
you
get
this
enhancement
you
have
to
be
guilty
of
obstructing
justice,
and
i
don't
suppose
that
a...
that
every
judge
would
consider
every
piece
of
lying
that
he
hears
in
the
courtroom
to
obstruct
justice,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
say
in
this
instance.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't...
do
you
think
the
guidelines
requires
them
to...
to
hold
that
a
testifying
defendant
is
obstructing
justice
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
lie
he
tells?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't...
that
isn't
what
the
guidelines
say...
say
to
me
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
every...
every...
every
piece
of
perjury
or
lying
on
the
stand
by
a
testifying
defendant
obstructs
justice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
there
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--sure...
sure...
so
a
judge
then...
and
i
suppose
a
judge
could
say
how
material
is
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
some
perjuries
that
will
obstruct
justice
and
some
that
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
just
said
that's
true.
