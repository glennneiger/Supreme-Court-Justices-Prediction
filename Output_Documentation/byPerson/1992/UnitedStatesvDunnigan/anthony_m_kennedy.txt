anthony

does
perjury
imply
a
finding
of
willfulness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
he
didn't
say
that
she
was
convicted
of...
that
she
committed
perjury
in
so
many
words,
did
he?
he
said
she
should
be
assessed
with
a
two-point
addition
for
obstruction
of
justice
by
reason
of
her
trial
testimony,
she
was
untruthful
at
trial.
he
doesn't
anywhere
say
that
she
committed
perjury,
did
he?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
say
that
it
wasn't
willful,
given
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
some
cases
the
defendant
might
not
be
believed,
but
her
testimony
might
not
be
willfully...
willfully.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
that
allocution,
if
the
defendant
makes
a
statement
that's
not
sworn...
well,
suppose
the
defendant
said
everything
that
was
said
on
cross...
on...
on...
on...
at
trial
at
allocution,
and
did
not
take
the
stand
at
trial,
could
the
sentence
then
be
enhanced?
if
the
defendant
said
i
didn't
do
it,
i
wasn't
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
sworn
for
allocution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
allocution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
yeah.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
larkin,
can
you
tell
us,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
if
the
trial
judge
is
convinced
that
there's
been
perjury,
that
he
must
enhance?
he
must,
number
one,
go
ahead
and
make
the
findings
and
then
enhance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
he
have
the
discretion
not
to
make
the
finding
if
he's
convinced
that
there's
a
fair
probability
of
perjury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
but
does
he
have
to...
to
make
the
finding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
he
have
to
proceed
to
make
the
inquiry--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if,
say,
he's
convinced
or
there's
probably
cause
to
believe
there's
perjury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
someone
being
the
government,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
one
step
anterior
to
that
he
also
must
make
the
inquiry,
at
the
request
of
the
government,
if
there's
plausible
ground
for
believing
that
perjury
was
committed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
case
i
have
for
the
court
is
united
states
versus
dunnigan.
the
case
is
a
criminal
case
that
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondent,
sharon
dunnigan
was
charged
in
a
single
count
indictment
with
conspiracy
to
distribute
cocaine.
at
trial,
the
government's
case
and
chief
consisted
of
five
witnesses,
each
of
whom
implicated
the
respondent
as
a
participant
in
a
cocaine's
conspiracy
during
the
summer
of
1988.
the
respondent,
dunnigan
then
elected
to
take
a
stand
and
she
was
a
sole
witness
in
her
defense.
she
denied
all
the
criminal
acts
attributed
to
her.
on
cross-examination,
the
government
had
even
a
further
witness
ready.
they
examined
dunnigan
to
ask
whther
or
not,
edward
dickerson
had
ever
bought
cocaine
from
her
and
dunnigan
denied
that.
the
defense
rested
and
then
government
then
called
dickerson,
who
then
became
the
six
witness
for
the
government.
he
testified
the
purchasing
of
cocaine
from
respondent
in
a
transaction
monitored
by
law
enforcement
officials
and
the
respondent
was
convicted.
the
jury
found
her
guilty.
at
sentencing,
the
district
court
increased
respondent's
offence
level
by
two
levels
for
willfully
obstructing
or
impending
justice
under
sensencing
guidelines
3c1.1.
the
district
court
found
that
by
virtue
of
the
respondent's
failure
to
give
truthful
testimony
on
material
matters
that
were
designed
to
substantially
affect
the
outcome
of
the
case.
an
enhancement
for
obstructing
justice
rewarded.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
according
that
a
3c1.1
enhancement
based
on
defendant's
alleged
perjury
at
trial
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
court
ruled
that
with
an
automatic
enhancement,
enhanced
and
added
to
the
other
incentives
for
defendant
not
to
testify,
the
defendant
may
not
think
testifying
worth
the
risk.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
both
parties
assumed
that
the
3c1's
phrase
impede
or
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice
covers
perjury,
and
the
comment
to
that
section
is
explicit
in
self
providing.
in
determining
what
constitutes
perjury,
we
rely
upon
the
definition
found
in
the
federal
perjury
statute.
the
witness
testifying
under
oath,
violates
the
statute.
if
she
gives
false
testimony
concerning
the
material
matter
with
the
willful
intent
to
provide
false
testimony
rather
than
as
a
result
of
confusion
or
mistake
or
faulty
memory
because
not
every
accused
to
testifies
at
trial
and
is
convicted
commits
perjury.
if
the
accused
objects
to
a
sense
enhancement
resulting
from
his
trial
testimony,
district
court
must
as
it
did
here
review
the
evidence
and
make
independent
findings
necessary
to
satisfy
the
perjury
definition
we
have
set
out.
on
turning
to
the
contention
that
we
enhance
sentenced
for
perjury
undermines
the
right
to
testify,
we
reject
that
argument.
the
requirement
the
district
court
make
independent
findings
at
perjury,
dispels
any
concern.
the
courts
will
enhance
sentences
as
a
matter
of
course.
and
as
to
the
risk
of
incorrect
findings
at
perjury,
that
risk
is
inherent
and
the
system
which
insists
on
the
value
of
the
testimony
under
oath.
neither
can
we
accept
respondent's
argument,
that
the
enhancement
advances
only
the
impermissible
sentencing
practice
of
incarcerating
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
government
the
burden
of
bringing
the
separate
and
subsequent
perjury
prosecution.
enhancement
is
more
than
a
mere
surrogate
for
a
perjury
prosecution.
it
furthers
legitimate
sentencing
goals
relating
to
the
principal
crime
including
the
goals
of
retribution
and
incapacitation.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
