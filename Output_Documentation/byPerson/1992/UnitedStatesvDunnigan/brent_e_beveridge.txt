mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
purpose
of
me
being
here
today
is
to
assert
that
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
properly
decided
that
there
was
a
chilling
effect
on
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
testify
on
one's
own
behalf.
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
instance
basically
said
why
it
had
a
chilling
effect,
and...
when
you
consider
all
the
factors
that
are
involved
in
determining
whether
a
defendant
should
testify.
basically,
i'm
here
to
assert
and
tell
you
why
the...
or
how
the
chilling
effect
takes
place.
and
if
you
look
at
grayson,
which
is
the
key
case
originally
decided
on
the
right
of
the
court
to
consider
those
as
an
aggravating
factor,
the
defendant's
perjured
testimony
at
trial,
you
can
see
in
there
that
there
is
a
reference
to
the
case
of
hummelway
v.
arkansas.
which
basically
says...
in
a
footnote
in
hummelway
v.
arkansas,
is
that
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
has
an
obligation
to
court...
to
the
court,
to
present
testimony
that
is
true
or
accurate
or
reasonable,
and
counsel
has
made
an
effort
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
testifying
to
perjurious
events.
and
in
this
instance,
what
we
have
is
a
case
where
the
burden
on
counsel
in
this
instance...
and
this
goes
to
the
very
roots
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
counsel
presents
testimony
at
trial
and
before
your
client
testifies
you
go
to
your
client
and
basically
say,
you
know,
these
are
the
things
that
you
should
consider
before
you
testify.
and
under
the
guideline
in
this
instance,
that
if
it's
applied
with
an
automatic
enhancement,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
for
perjured
testimony,
you're
going
to
have
to
advise
your
client
that
if
you
take
the
stand
and
you
lose,
effectively
you're
going
to
get
a
two-level
enhancement.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
before
the
guidelines
you
would
advise
him
that
the
judge
has
discretion.
and
if
you
get
on
the
stand
and
you
give
a
cock-and-bull
story,
the
judge
can
come
up
with
an
aggravated
circumstance
such
as
in
grayson
that
could
apply.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
now
you've
reached
a
level
of
automatic
enhancement,
and
so
you--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--right.
so
then
and
in
grayson--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--and
in
the...
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
if
there
was
ever
oral
argument
in
a
case
that
had
an
impact
on
the
ultimate
outcome,
the
oral
argument
in
the
fourth
circuit,
at
which
time
the
government
basically
stated
that
every
guilty
verdict
in
which
a
defendant
testifies,
it's
going
to
result
in
an
automatic
enhancement.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
the...
the
facts
of
this
case
involved
a
finding
and
the
question
was
posed
as
to
what
the
finding
was.
and
the
finding
in
this
instance,
there
were
not
specific
findings
such
as
have
been
recommended
in
the
eighth
and
tenth
circuits
and
followed
where,
you
know,
you
testified
that
you
were
not
in
the
apartment,
there
is
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
that
you
had
an
apartment
key,
three
government
agents
were
standing
there
and
saw
you
in
the
apartment.
there
were
no
findings
such
as
that.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
if
they
can...
it
has
been,
and
that's
one
of
the
inconsistencies
of
the
guidelines
themselves.
one
circuit
basically
says
that
findings
mean
more
than
just
simply
finding
inconsistencies.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
the
fourth
circuit
addressed
this
and
basically
says
we
have
no
reviewable
findings
in
this
instance.
the
only
thing
we
have--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--not
according
to
what
has
been
recommended,
what
has
been
followed
in--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--well,
and
if
you
follow
in
the
cases
the
eighth
circuit
has
decided--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--yes.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
and
one
of
the
problems
exists
with
the
inconsistencies
among
the
various
circuits
in
their
treating
what
constitutes
a
finding.
within
one
circuit
it
requires
a
specific
finding
that
an
apartment,
a
key,
a
license
plate,
a
vehicle
belonged
to
a
specific
defendant,
while
in
other
circuits
it
basically
says
we
will
look
to
the
record
and
review
the
record
as
to
the
facts,
whether
she
went...
in
this
instance,
whether
she
went
to
cleveland,
whether
she
sold
the
crack
to
mr.
dickerson,
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
in
other
circuits
it's
basically
we
will
just
simply
rubberstamp
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
we
will
rubberstamp
an
independent
finding.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
they
would
not
say
rubberstamp.
we
will
look
at
this
and
we--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--i'm
characterizing,
your
honor.
and,
as
i...
as
i
indicated
in
this
instance,
the
counsel
and
the
burden
that
is
placed
upon
counsel
for
self-protection
purposes,
it
involves
telling
your
client
i
do
not
know
what
your...
whether
you
are
perjuring
yourself,
but
i
am
telling
you,
basically,
that
if
the
court
hears
your
testimony
and
you
are
found
guilty,
then
you
will
be
subjected
to
an
automatic
enhancement.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
the
government
has
taken
that
position
before
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
the...
the
problem
with...
with
that
is
that
ultimately
counsel
is
going
to
have
an
influence
upon
his
client.
and
in
this
instance,
it
sure
would
have
resulted,
or
what
the
fourth
circuit
found
as
a
potential
chilling
effect
in
this
instance,
that
counsel
is
going
to
advise
the
client
that
perjury
could
be
and
will
be
found.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
more
than
an
increased
degree,
as
we
have
found
throughout
the...
the
various
circuits
that
have
decided
and
basically
have
said
that
as
long
as
the
court
makes
a
simple
finding
of
perjury
and
as
long
as
it's
not
solely
based
upon
the
jury
verdict,
that
it
will
be
found.
it's
a
much
greater
degree.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
it
becomes...
and
as
we've
found,
the
critics
of
the
guidelines
have
pointed
out
that
basically
the
rule
of
lenity
has
been
ignored
and
that...
that
covered--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--one
is
the
standard
of
review,
your
honor,
which
is
the
clearly
wrong
standard
of
review
as
it
relates
to
the
sentencing
guidelines.
two
is
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
when
it
comes
to
the
application
of
the
enhancements
that
exist
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
right.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
your
honor,
in
response
to
what
obstruction
of
justice
means,
and
in
this
instance
the
obstruction
of
justice
is
equated
to
a
finding
of
perjury.
and
regardless
whether
or
not
obstruction
of
the
judicial
system
actually
occurs,
essentially
it's
flaunting
the
court's
authority
or
punishing
actions
in
front
of
the
court.
and
it's...
which
have...
being
an
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
no,
your
honor,
there
has
not
been.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
the...
the
two-level
enhancement
is
what's
prescribed
and
specifically
prescribed--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--within
the
sentencing
guideline,
the
3(c)1.1.
and--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--your
honor,
that
is...
the
advice
would
be
good
advice
in
all
cases.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
and
that
would
be--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
if
i
may
explain,
there
you're
talking
about
a
jury
finding
of
guility
and
you're
finding
a
judicial...
a
judge's
finding
of
obstruction
and
perjury.
the
jury
only
makes
the
finding
of
guilty
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
and
in
this
instance
ms.
dunnigan
was
charged
with
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
crack
cocaine.
she
got
on
the
witness
stand
and
denied
distributing
crack
cocaine,
denied
going
to
cleveland,
denied
being
involved
with
these
individuals
who
testified
against
her.
and
she...
the
judge's
finding,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
finding
of
obstruction
of
justice
which
basically
is
equated
with
perjury.
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
the
two
and
the
question
that
was
asked
to
counsel
here
beforehand
was
if...
if
you're...
if
you're
talking
about
obstruction,
that
it
occurs
at
the
time
of
allocution,
then
there
is
no
enhancement.
you
can
get
up
and
say
whatever
you
want
at
that
time.
if
you
get
on
and
testify
at
the
time
of
trial,
you
could
also
say
whatever
you
want
to
say
if
you're
out
there
and
the
police
come
to
your
house
and
they
say
is
this
your
apartment,
is
this
your
dog,
is
this
your
car?
you
can
reply
no.
you
can
lie
to
them
and
do
whatever
you
want
to
do
and
it
is
not
an
obstruction
of
justice,
even
though
it
may
exist
as
over...
it
may
result
in
200
more
manhours
from
the
police
to
have
given
that
false
information,
that
is
not
an
obstruction
of
justice
and
cannot
be
considered
for
the
enhancement.
but
if
you
get
on
and
testify
at
trial
when
your
fifth
amendment
rights
and
your
sixth
amendment
rights
come
into
play,
if
you
get
on
and
testify
at
that
time
falsely
and
even
though
it
results
in
no
more
witnesses
being
called,
it
results
in
no
more
additional
manhours
on
the
part
of
investigative
officers,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
your
honor--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--when
the...
your
honor,
as
i
tried
to
point
out,
and
maybe
perhaps
inadequately,
to
the
court,
the
counsel
is...
his
license
to
practice
law,
basically,
gets
on
the
line,
and
much
more
so
than
what
you
speak
of
in
a
grayson
situation
where
the
judge
has
discretion
and
an
individual
gets
on
and
testifies
and
simply
gets
on,
does
not
give
a
cock-and-bull
story,
does
not
go
out
far
in
left
field
and
say
that
he
was
in
australia
at
the
time
that
this
offense
happened.
he
gets
on
and
simply
says
i
did
not
go
to
cleveland,
i
did
not
distribute
crack,
i
did
not
do
any
of
these
things
alleged
in
the...
in
the
government's
proof.
and
in
that
instance,
it
still
results
in
perjury
and
i
can
see
the
day
coming,
and
if
it's
not
here
already,
that
the
trial
judge
afterwards
said
mr.
beveridge,
you
just
put
on
ms.
dunnigan
to
testify
in
this
instance
and
she
testified
contrary.
you
knew
that
the
government
had
tapes
of
these
telephone
conversations
or
bus-trip
tickets
and
you
went
ahead
and
put
her
on
anyway.
and
now
it's
your
turn
to
essentially
be
on
the
firing
line
and
be
the
one
subjected.
and
if
you
want
to
extend
this,
then
there
is
a
concern
and
a
legitimate
concern
that
it
may
be
extended
to
the
entire
legal
system
as
we
know
it.
and
why
not
in
civil
cases?
what
is
the
difference
when
an
individual
gets
on
and
testifies
that
the
light
was
red
in
an
automobile
accident
case?
the
plaintiff
gets
on
and
testifies
that
it
is
green
and
the
jury
finds
for
the
plaintiff.
why
isn't
there
a
finding
of
perjury
for
the
72-year-old
lady
who
also...
who
testified
that
the
light
was
red?
there's
no
diffference.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
not--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--no,
there...
it
can
be
brought,
but
not
to
the
extent
that
it
is
brought
now
in
these
criminal
proceedings.
there...
everybody
abhors
perjury.
an
attorney
who
is
representing
a
criminal
defendant,
the
judiciary
sits
there
and
would
like
to
choke
people
who
get
up
there
and
testifies
falsely
in
the
face
of
all
kind
of
substantial
evidence
in
front
of
them.
and
the
right
to
impose
a
penalty
for
that,
there
are
perjury
statutes
that
you
can
impose
the
penalties
for
and
not
impose
it
without
the
safeguards
that
are
available.
the
little
old
lady
who
is
accused
of
perjury
would
have
all
kind
of
safeguards
before
she
is
convicted
of
it.
she
would
have
the
right--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--but
there...
that
is
specifically...
this
is
penal.
and
the
absence...
the
fourth
circuit
stepped
forward
and
said
there
are
inadequate
safeguards
to
assure
that,
one,
is
the
burden
of
proof...
whether
it
is
applied
properly.
and
if
you
look
at
the
circuits,
the
various
circuits
and
what
they've
decided
and
the
conflicts
within
them,
the
procedural
safeguards
are
not
there.
you
have
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
themselves
as
opposed
to
little
old
ladies
being
stuck
with
perjury
or
even
attorneys
for
little
old
ladies
being
stuck
with
rule
11
sanctions
or
any
kind
of
penalties
involved.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
my
client
got
an
additional...
if
she
would
be
sentenced
at
the
bottom
of
the
next--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--two
levels
down,
she
would
have
gotten
approximately
10
months.
in
the
difference,
in
the
sentence
and
what
she
had
received,
she
received
51
months
in
this
instance.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
she
would
have
gotten
60...
61
months
if
this
didn't...
well,
she
would
have
gotten--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--10
months.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
40...
well--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--it
depends
on...
at
what
level
you
are
and
what
your
criminal
history
category
is.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
i...
i
hate
to
rely
upon...
and
in
response
to
that
there
is
a
court
opinion,
basically,
that
echoes
what
you're
saying
about...
we
have
taken
the
sentencing
guidelines,
we
have
accepted
them,
we
have
accepted
grayson,
which
is...
is
acceptable,
and
we're
not
arguing
that
grayson
is
unacceptable.
but
there
is
a
dissent
or
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
edwards
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
u.s.
v.
harrington
in
which
he
basically
relies
on
a
hans
christian
anderson,
the
emperor
has
new
clothes,
as
the
opening
for
what
he
says.
and
he
says
basically
we
have
accepted
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
we
have
found
out
after
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
in
place
that
there
are
many
problems
that
exist.
and
within
those
sentencing
guidelines...
and
as
he
points
out,
it's
always
the
rule...
instead
of
the
rule
of
lenity
it's
always
the
harshest
result
that
could
happen.
the
little
old
lady
would
receive,
as
a
matter
of
equitable
lenity,
a
break
when
she
said
the
light
was
red.
but
the
criminal
defendants,
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
end
up
with
the
harsh
result,
basically
because
they
say
this
is
the
cure-all
for
uniform
sentences.
and
as
judge
edwards
points
out,
there
are
not
uniform
sentences
because
there
are
basically
games
that
you
play
with
the
sentencing
guidelines.
and
as
we
see,
the
eighth
circuit
has
dealt
with
this
issue.
of
all
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
both
briefs,
the
eighth
circuit
has
dealt
with
all
the
issues
on
at
least
nine
or
ten
cases.
and
our
court
of
appeals
are
clogged
up
right
now
debating
basically
what
standard
should
we
use,
whether
these
things
are
mandatory.
we
are
spending
millions
of
dollars
per
year
on
these
sentencing
guidelines
arguing
about
these
difficult,
cumbersome,
unfair,
disproportionate...
and
it
does
not
cure
what
they
were
intended
to
do.
if
you
read,
there
are...
and
i've
cited
in
my
brief
and
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
and
none
of
them
have
any
consistency
among
them.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
but
you
have
the
right
to
declare
unconstiutional
the
applications
that
are
used
in
this
instance
where
the
judge
is
forced
into
implementing
the
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
not
under
3(c)1.1.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
it's
only
once...
once
he
gets...
he
can
step
up
afterwards,
after--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--there
is
a
specific
holding,
u.s.
v.
faila,
f-a-i-l-a,
and
i
believe
it's
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
929
fed
2d
285,
where
it
says
that
you
get
an
enhancement
once
you
get
to
trial
and
you
lie
about
this
under
oath
or
at
a
supression
hearing.
but
if
you
lie
back
here
at
the
time
they
were
trying
to
arrest
you
on
the
turnpike
or
wherever
you
were,
about
whose
car
this
was
and
the
time
that
they
spent,
hundreds
of
manhours,
is
not
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
so
is
perjury
during
trial.
there's
no
rationality.
and,
you
know,
judge
edwards
points
this
out
when
he...
when
he
points
to
that,
you
know,
we've
accepted
these
federal
sentencing
guidelines
without
question.
and
there
have
been
some,
such
as
judge
bright
in
the
eighth
circuit,
who
has
advocated
and
has
come
up
with...
and
judge
haney,
judge
haney
in
the
eighth
circuit,
who
have
come
up
with
a...
for
example,
they
use
an
objective
standard
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
defendant
lied.
and
basically
is
no
reasonable
jury
would
have
believed
him,
which
is
what...
the
standard
that
would
be
applied
to
the
little
old
lady
who
ran
the
red
light.
and
the
eighth
circuit
decided
the
objective
standards
and
right
after
that
the
d.c.
circuit
rejected
it
and
said
we'll...
we'll
rely
upon
the
judge's
independent
subjective
finding
that
the
defendant
lied.
we
don't
need
any
reasoning
such
as
judge
haney
said
in
willis,
united
states
v.
willis,
and
said
we're
not
going
to
use
this
objective
standards.
and,
of
course,
there's
a
dissent
in
u.s.
v.
thompson.
the
d.c.
circuit
case
decided,
rejecting
willis,
rejecting
dunnigan.
and
the
circuits
go
all
over
the
place
in
each
one
of
these
cases
and
it
does
not
result
in
uniformity
of
sentence
and
ease
of
application.
i
have
practiced
for
20
years
in
the
trial
courts
of
the
northern
and
southern
districts
of
west
virginia
and
i
would
much
rather...
having
a
person
sitting
on
a
bench
behind
there
deciding
it
than
some
numbers.
and
the
judges,
as
they
sit
out
there,
need
to
have
some
of
that
discretion
restored.
this
is
not
a
discretionary
thing
in
this
instance.
it
becomes--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--in
this
instance--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--in--
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
that's
the
way
they
are
construed
at...
at
the
present
time
and
that's
the
way
they
are
applied.
mr.
brent
e.
beveridge
well,
the
guidelines
say
that
you
should
apply
a
standard
most...
much
the
same
as
a
directed
verdict
standard
and
much
the
same
as
what
the
eighth
circuit
has
applied
in
united
states
v.
willis.
the
guidelines
say
that
you
should
apply
it
and
if
this
is
sustained
as
being
constitutional,
then
that
is
the
standard
that
should
be
used,
that
if
no
reasonable
jury
would
have
believed
this
story
or
these
facts.
and
to
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
and
that's
essentially
a
legislated
rule
of
lenity
that
exists
under
the
note...
note
1
and
note
3
of
the
sentencing
guideline
in
question
in
this
instance,
that
it
should
be
applied,
and
not
every
case
where
a
defendant
is
convicted.
and
the
courts
have
said,
basically,
that
if
you
applied
it,
and
much
the
same
as
in
this
instance,
what...
as
what
the
fourth
circuit
says,
that
it
was
an
automatic
enhancement.
that's
what
the
government
argued
and
that's
what
the
government
is
arguing
out
there,
whether
it's
in
the
ninth
circuit,
whether
it's
in
the
eighth
circuit,
or
the
d.c.
circuit.
they're
arguing
that
and
telling
the
district
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
the
defendant
was
convicted,
the
defendant
obviously
lied,
you've
upheld
the
verdict
in
this
case,
you
haven't
set
it
aside
when
the
defendant
has
testified,
and
it
is
mandatory.
and
discretion
has
been
transferred
from
the
sentencing
judge
who
was
afforded
all
kind
of
discretion
in
grayson.
and
i
agree,
united
states
v.
williams,
i
agree.
thank
you,
your
honor.
