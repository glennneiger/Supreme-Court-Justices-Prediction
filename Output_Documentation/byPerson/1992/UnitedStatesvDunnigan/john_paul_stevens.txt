justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
right,
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
judges
who
are
very
unhappy
with
the
sentencing
guidelines.
but
i'm
afraid
we
don't
have
the
power
to
repeal
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
got
back
to
one
thing
you
said
earlier.
you
said
that
if
a...
a
person
who
is
charged
or
being
suspected
of
a
crime
lies
to
police
officers
during
the
course
of
the
investigation
and
lies
here
and
there
and
obstructs,
that
that's
not
obstruction
of
justice--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean
maybe
it's
not
covered
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
are
there
holdings
that
that
would
not
qualify
as
obstruction
of
justice?
