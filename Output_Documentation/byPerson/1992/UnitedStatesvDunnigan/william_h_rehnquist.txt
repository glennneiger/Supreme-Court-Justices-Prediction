chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-1300,
united
states
against
sharon
dunnigan.
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
beveridge,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
are
you
paraphrasing
the
language
of
the
courts
of
appeals
here?
did
they
say
we
will
rubberstamp
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
what
the
district
court
has
done?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
should
be
careful,
mr.
beveridge.
if
you're
describing
a
holding
of
a
court,
you
should
not
put
words
in
the
mouth
of
the
court
that
weren't
there.
if
you're
characterizing
it
yourself,
that's
another
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
would
that
be
sound
advice
in
view
of
the
position
that
the
government
and
other
courts
of
appeals
have
taken,
that
it
is
not
automatic
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
jury
finds
a
defendant
who
has
testified
guilty
does
not
mean
it's...
it's
an
automatic
enhancement
of
justice,
an
obstruction
of
justice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
take...
it
certainly
doesn't
take
that
position
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
counsel
would
be
obliged
to
have
advised
that
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
that
perjury
could
be
found
under
our
grayson
opinion.
it's
just
possibly
a
question
of
slightly
increased
degree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
somehow
greater
than
it
was
under...
under
grayson,
so
far
as
the
reviewability
or
the
ability
of
the
trial
judge
to
make
that
sort
of
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're...
you're
not
answering
my...
i
asked
you
a
rather
specific
question,
mr.
beveridge,
and
i'd
appreciate
your
answering
it.
my
question
was
why
is
the
action
of
the
district
court
prior
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
that
might
have
taken
place
under
our
grayson
opinion
any
more
reviewable
than
the
action
of
a
district
court
following
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
mean
if
a...
if
a
district
court
finds
there
was
obstruction
of
justice,
it
must
enhance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
that
if
a
defendant
testifies
at
trial
and
loses,
it
must
find
obstruction
of
justice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
we're
not
talking
about
simply
augmenting
her
sentence,
either.
we're
talking
about
a
separate
criminal
prosecution
for
perjury
itself,
and...
which,
you
know,
is
not
necessarily
the...
simply
an
incident
of...
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
you're...
you're
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
historically
the
sentencing
judges
had
a
great
deal
of
authority
to
consider
other
conduct
in
imposing
a
sentence.
and
that,
i
think,
quite
distinguishes
it
from
a
civil
case
in
which
a
losing
defendant
is
not
sentenced
to
anything.
the
defendant
simply
is
required
to
pay
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beveridge.
mr.
larkin,
you
have
16
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
