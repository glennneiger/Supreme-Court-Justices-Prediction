justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
isn't
that...
that,
then,
is
your
point,
that
the
enhancement
is
automatic
and
it
wasn't
automatic
in
grayson.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
say...
excuse
me.
you
say
it's
automatic
because
it
follows
simply
from
the
fact
of
testimony
followed
by
a
conviction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe...
maybe
the...
i
don't
dispute
that
the
government
may
have
said
that,
but
that
was
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
may
not
have
been,
but
i'm
looking
at
findings
as
you
quote
them
in
your
brief
and
the
trial
judge
is
saying
the
defendant
denied
her
involvement
when
it
is
clear
from
the
evidence
in
the
case,
as
the
jury
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
she
was
involved
in
the
conspiracy
and
so
on.
doesn't
that
make
it
reasonably
clear
that
he's
making
the
finding
himself?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
so,
but
don't
we...
aren't
we
entitled
to
say
as
a
threshold
matter
that
what
the
court
in
this
case
did
was
to
make
his
own
finding?
he
may
not
have
made
it
with
the
kind
of
tomey
and
detail
that
some
of
the
other
circuits
require,
but
this
is
a
finding
of
the
court,
it's
not
merely
a
recitation
of
what
the
jury
found,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
you
think
what
i...
don't
you
think
what
i
just
quoted
to
you
is
a
reviewable
finding?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
forget
what
had
been
recommended.
isn't
it
a
reviewable
finding?
can't
we
look
to
the
record
to
decide
whether
it
is
clear
from
the
evidence
or
whether...
whether,
indeed,
a
trial
court
could
so
have
found
on
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
isn't--
--justice
souter
asked
you
a
question.
i
think
you
should
answer
it
and
then
perhaps
explain
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
beveridge,
have
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
considered
the
question
whether
there
is
discretion
as
to
the
amount
of
the
enhancement?
this
does
speak
indeed
of...
of
two
levels,
but
have
there
been
actually
any
holdings
that
a
judge
could
say
well,
i'm
only
going
to
go
one
level?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your...
to
your
chilling
argument
and
ask
you
this.
even
if
there
were
no
enhancement
possible,
even
if
grayson
had
gone
the
other
way
and
the
guidelines
did
not
provide
as
they
provide,
wouldn't
it
be
good
advice
to
a
client
in
a
criminal
case,
in
anticipation
of
his
decision
to
take
the
stand
or
not
to
take
the
stand,
to
tell
that
client
that
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
lies
and
the
jury
so
concludes
that
he
is
lying,
he
is
doing
himself
immense
damage
and
that
it
would,
in
fact,
be
better
for
him
not
to
take
the
stand
and
lie?
wouldn't
that
be
good
advice?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
much
more
chilling
is
it
to
tell
him
that
not
only
is
he
going
to
be
in
serious
trouble
with
the
jury,
but
he's
also
going
to
be
in
serious
trouble
with
the
judge?
if
the
one
is
chilling,
the
other's
chilling,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
all
of
this
is
true
but
i
don't
see
what
it's
got
to
do
with
the
chilling
effect
on
honest
witnesses.
if
an
honest
witness
is
not
going
to
be
chilled
from
testifying
when
the
lawyer
tells
the
witness
in
advance
that
the
witness
will
be
in
trouble
if
he
lies,
i
don't
see
why
the
witness
who
is
otherwise
honest
is
going
to
be
chilled
any
further
by
telling
him
that
he's
not
only
going
to
be
in
trouble
with
the
jury
if
he
lies,
but
in
trouble
with
the
judge
when
he
lies.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
the
one
substantially
more
chilling
to
the
honest
witness
than
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
larkin,
i
have
one
question.
do
you
agree
with
your
brother
that
if
there
is
an...
an
enhancement
it
must
be
the
two-level
enhancement,
that
there's
no
discretion
to
make
it
a
one-level
enhancment?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
where
the
discretion
comes.
