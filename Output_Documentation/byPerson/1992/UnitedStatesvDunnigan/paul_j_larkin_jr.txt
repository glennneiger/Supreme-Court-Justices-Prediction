mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
constitution
prohibits
a
district
court
from
enhancing
a
defendant's
sentence
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
if
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury
when
he
testified
at
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
constitution
forbids
a
district
court
from
applying
the
guidelines
in
that
manner,
and
we
disagree.
long
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
went
into
effect,
a
district
court
at
sentencing
could
take
into
account
its
belief
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury
when
he
testified.
nothing
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
alters
that
long-settled
rule
or
justifies
the
conclusion
that
the
constitution
now
demands
that
a
different
balance
must
be
struck.
respondent
was
a
member
of
an
organization
responsible
for
distributing
cocaine
in
charleston,
west
virginia.
the
government's
evidence,
which
consisted
largely
of
the
eyewitness
testimony
of
respondent's
former
confederates,
showed
that
respondent
was
responsible
for
purchasing
powdered
cocaine,
manufacturing
it
into
crack
cocaine,
and
then
selling
the
crack.
respondent's
defense
at
trial
was
simple.
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it,
respondent
took
the
stand
and
denied
everything.
the
district
court,
however,
credited
the
government's
evidence
and
convicted
respondent
of
conspiracy
to
traffic
in
drugs.
at
sentencing
the
district
court
found
that
respondent
had
committed
perjury
when
she
testified
at
trial.
the
district
court's
finding
is
at
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix.
based
on
that
finding,
the
district
court
concluded
that
sentencing
guidelines
section
3c1.1
required
a
two-point
enhancement
to
the
base
offense
level.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
case
law
makes
that
point
so
that
a
person
who
perjures
herself
at
trial
has
willfully
obstructed
or
attempted
to
obstruct
justice.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
he
doesn't.
he
doesn't,
i
think,
use
that
precise
term
at
page
29.
but
he
does
assess
her
the
two
point
enhancement
because
he
found
that
she
was
untruthful
at
trial
with
respect
to
material
matters
in
this
case.
and
that,
we
think,
is
a
sufficient
finding
to
justify
the
enhancement
under
that
guideline.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct...
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
would
like
to
make
that
point
very
clear.
it's
not
our
position
that
a
district
court
either
should
or
can
enhance
a
defendant's
sentence
simply
because
the
defendant
was
convicted
after
testifying.
the
district
court
must
make
a
finding
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury.
that
finding
cannot
be
based
simply
on
the
jury's
verdict
of
conviction.
the
court,
under
this
guideline
as
under
the
other
guidelines
that
are
now
in
place
in
the
federal
system,
has
the
fact-finding
responsibility
to
decide
whether
enhancements
are
appropriate
once
the
court
calculates
the
base
offense
level.
in
making
that
finding,
the
district
court
is
entitled
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence,
since
both
the
sentencing
reform
act
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
direct
district
courts
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence.
but
the
district
court
must
make
an
independent
finding
in
this
regard
and
that,
we
think,
is
an
adequate
response
to
many
of
the
concerns
that
otherwise
might
be
raised
about
this
guideline.
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
application
of
the
guideline
and
the
way
the
district
court
conducted
it
rendered
the
guideline
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
held
that
the
sentence
had
to
be
set
aside
and
the
case
vacated
and
remanded.
in
the
course
of
its
ruling,
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
rejected
the
contrary
conclusion
that
had
been
adopted
by
numerous
other
courts
of
appeals,
eight
in
number
now,
and
we
believe
that
in
so
doing
the
fourth
circuit
erred.
historically,
the
criminal
law
found
it
important
to
allow
a
sentencing
judge
to
consider
a
broad
range
of
information,
including
prior
misconduct
by
the
defendant.
in
fact,
prior
misconduct
was
deemed
so
probative
and
so
weighty
that
a
district
court
at
sentencing
was
entitled
to
consider
such
evidence
even
in
the
absence
of
a
conviction.
among
the
types
of
misconduct
that
a
court
could
consider
at
sentencing
was
the
defendant's
perjury
at
trial.
in
1978
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
grayson,
this
court
endorsed
that
practice.
the
court
at
the
same
time
also
rejected
the
argument
that
allowing
a
trial
judge
to
consider
his
firsthand
observations
of
the
defendant's
perjury
would
amount
to
punishing
the
defendant
for
an
uncharged
crime
or
would
deter
other
defendants
from
taking
the
stand.
the
background
principles
of
law
against
which
grayson
was
decided
are
still
vital
today.
when
the
guidelines
went
into
effect
on
november
1
of
1987,
those
principles
were
not
changed.
in
fact,
the
court
in
cases
has
made
clear
that
those
principles
are
still
valid.
for
example,
in
the
last
two
terms
in
the
payne
and
dawson
cases,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
a
district
court
at
sentencing
is
entitled
to
consider
a
broad
range
of
information.
in
addition,
in
the
case
of
nix
v.
whiteside
the
court
has
made
clear
the
defendant's
right
to
testify
does
not
include
the
right
to
give
false
testimony.
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
embrace
those
principles.
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
kennedy,
both
the
act
and
the
guidelines
direct
the
district
courts
to
consider
a
broad
range
of
evidence
at
sentencing.
and
in
particular,
the
guideline
they
were
concerned
with
here
today,
section
3(c)1.1,
directs
the
district
courts
to
enhance
a
defendant's
sentence
if
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury.
that
guideline
therefore
serves
as
the
vehicle
through
which
the
sentencing
commission
and,
in
each
case,
the
district
court
can
implement
the
principle
that
this
court
approved
in
grayson.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
that
guideline
unconstitutionally
infringed
on
the
defendant's
right
to
testify
and
gave
several
reasons.
we
think
none
of
those
reasons
are
sufficient.
to
begin
with,
the
court
of
appeals
was
troubled
by
the
fact
that
section
3(c)1.1
classifies
a
defendant's
false
trial
testimony
as
the
obstruction
of
justice
rather
than
as
simply
one
factor
that
a
district
court
can
consider
or
ignore
in
the
exercise
of
its
sentencing
discretion.
the
label
used
to
describe
this
factor,
however,
should
be
immaterial
because
the
label
has
no
independent
effect.
in
addition,
the
guideline
is
not
a
disguised
means
of
punishing
the
defendant
for
a
crime
not
charged
against
him.
a
defendant
who
testifies
perjuriously
at
trial
thereby
indicates
his
willingness
to
break
the
law
when
he
finds
it
in
his
interest
to
do
so.
that
factor
therefore
shows
the
defendant
is
a
greater
danger
to
the
community
than
might
otherwise
be
the
case,
and
therefore
in
turn
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
what
period
of
incarceration
is
necessary
to
incapacitate
him
for
the
protection
of
society.
the
court
of
appeals
also
believed
that
because
this
guideline
is
mandatory,
it
amounts
to
the
type
of
wooden
or
reflex
enhancement
that
this
court
criticized
in
grayson.
while
it
is
true
that
grayson
did
not
direct
the
district
courts
in
every
case
to
enhance
a
defendant's
sentence
if
the
court
found
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury,
grayson
at
the
same
time
did
not
prohibit
congress
or
the
sentencing
commission
from
making
the
judgment
across
the
board
that
a
defendant's
trial
perjury
is
an
aggravating
factor
and
should
be
treated
as
such
in
every
case.
that
is
precisely
what
section
3(c)1.1
does.
there
is
also
nothing
unusual
about
codifying
this
rule
or
others
like
it.
the
sentencing
guidelines
codify
numerous
sentencing
factors
that
prior
law
had
left
to
the
individual
discretion
of
district
court
judges
in
each
case.
the
new
mandatory
nature
of
these
rules
is
just
the
inevitable
result
of
making
the
choice
to
target
a
district
court's
attention
to
certain
matters
deemed
aggravating
or
mitigating
and
to
guide
the
district
court
by
giving
weight
to
those
factors,
instead
of
leaving
to
each
court
in
each
case
the
authority
to
make
that
decision
for
himself
or
herself.
if
a
district
court,
however,
can
consider
defendant's
perjury
at
trial,
and
we
know
from
grayson
that
it
can,
a
district
court
then
can
be
channeled
in
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
by
congress
or
the
sentencing
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
also
believed
that,
again,
because
this
guideline
is
mandatory,
it
would
deter
innocent
defendants
from
testifying,
especially
defendants
with
prior
convictions.
we
think
that's
unlikely.
a
defendant
who
goes
to
trial
has
as
his
overriding
concern
avoiding
a
conviction.
a
defendant
therefore
will
decide
whether
to
testify
based
on
his
assessment
of
the
likelihood
that
his
testimony
will
increase
the
prospects
of
his
acquittal.
in
making
that
judgment
a
defendant
will
rely
on
various
factors,
such
as
the
strength
of
the
government's
case,
the
strength
of
the
other
defense
evidence
available,
the
defendant's
prior
record
or
other
factors
that
may
be
used
to
impeach
him,
his
credibility
as
a
witness,
and
his
ability
to
withstand
cross-examination.
we
think
it
would
be
a
rare
case
in
which
a
defendant,
after
balancing
all
those
factors,
concludes
that
he
should
testify
in
order
to
increase
his
chances
of
an
acquittal,
but
then
nonetheless
decides
against
doing
so
because
of
his
fear
that
the
jury
would
erroneously
believe
he
is
committing
perjury,
would
therefore
erroneously
convict
him,
and
that
the
district
court
then
erroneously
would
make
the
same
conclusion
and
enhance
his
sentence
under
this
guideline.
the
fourth
circuit
expressed
skepticism
that
the
district
courts
could
or
would
apply
this
guideline
properly
and
that
courts
of
appeals
could
or
would
police
the
actions
of
the
district
courts.
we
see
no
reason
to
be
pessimistic
in
this
regard.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
guideline
requires
that
a
defendant's
sentence
be
enhanced
if
the
court
makes
the
finding,
independent
of
the
jury's
verdict,
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury.
the
district
court,
therefore,
has
this
responsibility
at
sentencing,
like
many
of
the
other
responsibilities
district
courts
now
have
under
the
guidelines.
we
have
no
fear
that
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
will
not
be
able
to
apply
this
guideline
in
the
correct
manner.
in
fact,
this
court
in
grayson
expressed
no
fear
that
district
courts
would
misuse
the
sentencing
authority
that
was
recognized
in
that
case.
in
grayson
the
court
recognized
that
a
judge's
oath
of
office
and
a
judge's
integrity
would
be
a
sufficient
guarantee
that
district
courts
may
not
misuse
this
factor.
we
see
no
reason
today,
now,
simply
because
the
guidelines
are
in...
in
effect,
to
have
any
less
confidence
in
the
ability
of
district
courts
properly
to
conduct
the
sentencing
proceedings
than
this
court
did
back
in
1978.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it...
it
has
been
our
position
that
the
preponderance
standard
is
the
correct
standard.
the
sentencing
commission
also
takes
that
view.
the
one
court
you're
referring
to
is
a
third
circuit
case
called
kikamora.
in
that
case
what
in
essence
happened
was
a
defendant's
sentence
was
increased
from
a
guidelines
range
of
30
months
to
up
within
the
statutory
range
of
about
30
years.
and
what
the
third
circuit
said
was
when
you
have
a
situation
where
the
increase
is
that
great,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
apply
a
greater
standard
to
ensure
that
the
facts
are
found
in
a
proper
manner.
now
we
don't
have
any
type
of
increase
in
this
case
that
remotely
approaches
that
one,
and
we
have
rarely,
rarely
seen
that
sort
of
large
increase
in
other
cases.
the
third
circuit,
in
fact,
mentioned
in
that
case
that
it
hadn't
seen
it
in
other
cases,
i
believe,
and
certainly
no
other
court
since
then
has
applied
that
more
stringent
standard.
so
we
believe
that
in
accordance
with
the
court's
jurisprudence,
the
preponderance
standard
is
sufficient.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
sworn.
and--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
so
that
when
the
defendant
expresses
opinions,
for
example,
as
to
the
quantity
of
drugs
that
would
be
involved
in
a
particular
case,
since
the
judge
at
sentencing
has
to
make
findings
in
that
regard,
it
would
be
important
for
the
district
court
to
know
that
it
can
rely
on
what
the
defendant
says
if
the
defendant
is
sworn.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
thought
so,
your
honor,
but
i
was
just
advised
by
my
cocounsel
that
the
defendant
is
not.
if
that
were--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--true,
the
defendant
were
not
sworn,
then
the
judge
would
know
from
the
outset
that
he
would...
should
take
the
defendant's
statements
with
far
more
caution.
so
in
that
circumstance,
it
would
probably
not
be
appropriate,
i
think.
but
i
have
not
seen
that
precise
circumstance
arise.
there
are
situations
in
which
a
defendant,
for
example,
could
make
perjurious
statements
at
a
suppression
hearing.
he
wouldn't
be
at
trial,
but
it
would
be
at
another
type
of
hearing.
and
in
cases
like
that,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
consider
applying
this
enhancement,
because
in
many
cases
if
the
defendant
loses
at
the
suppression
hearing,
you'll
thereafter
not
have
a
trial,
you
may
just
have
a
guilty
plea.
but
that
is
an
impediment
to
the
effective
administration
of
justice.
so
there
are
circumstances
where
the
perjury
can
occur
other
than
at
trial.
and
if
it
does,
then
it
would
be
proper
basis
for
the
enhancement.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
a
judge
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
enhance
the
sentence
once
he
makes
the
requisite
finding.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
your
honor,
if
the
judge,
by
a
preponderance,
finds
that
the
defendant
committed
perjury,
he
must
then
go
ahead
and
make
the
finding.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
does
he--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--right.
i
think
the
best
way
to
answer
that
is
if
someone
asks
him
to
make
the
finding,
a
judge
is
required
to
go
ahead
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
evidence
satisfies
that
standard.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
or
the
probation
officer
which
has
to
prepare
a
probation
report
for
the
trial
judge.
and
if
the
judge
honestly
makes
the
finding,
then
he
must
go
ahead
and
make
the
enhancement.
because
otherwise,
your
honor,
you
don't
have
the
guidance
that
congress
and
the
sentencing
commission
believed
was
necessary.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
any
case
where
a
district
court
does
not
make
a
finding
and
the
government
then
tries
to
say
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
not
going
ahead
and
making
that
finding,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
the
obligation
is
on
the
government
to
urge
the
judge
to
make
the
finding.
and
therefore
unless
the
government
can
satisfy
the
plain
error
standard,
the
judgment
that
was
imposed
by
the
district
court
shouldn't
be
reversed.
so
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
parties--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--must
present
their
arguments--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
whether
a
judge,
when
he's
presented
with
the
presentence
report
and
is
reviewing
all
the
facts
of
the
trial,
should
independently
make
various
calculations
under
the
guidelines--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
mean
it
may
be
a
matter
that
a
judge
on
his
own
should
inquire
about.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
whether
there
is
an
appellate
reversal
for
not
doing
so--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
courts
have
applied
a
plain
error
rule.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
points.
one
is
i
would
like
to
correct
an
answer
i
gave
to
justice
kennedy.
justice
kennedy
asked
me
would
the
enhancement
be
applicable
at
allocution
because
the
defendant
would
normally
not
be
sworn.
and
it's
true
the
defendant
normally
would
not
be
sworn
at
allocution.
in
this
case,
however,
if
you
look
at
page
6
of
the
joint
appendix
you'll
see
that
the
defendant
was
sworn
at
the
outset
of
the
sentencing
proceeding.
plus,
under
the
1992
version
of
the
guidelines,
if
you
look
to
page
248,
you
will
see
that
one
of
the
comments
by
the
sentencing
commission
gives
as
an
example
of
instances
in
which
the...
the
guideline
could
be
applied,
quote,
providing
materially
false
information
to
a
judge
or
magistrate.
and
that
is...
does
not
exclude
the
allocution
stage.
and
secondly,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
it
can
be
the
case
that
a
false
statement
to
a
police
officer
could
lead
to
this
enhancement.
again,
if
you
look
to
the
same
volume
as
the
1992
edition
and
again
to
page
248,
you'll
see
that
another
comment
by
the
sentencing
commission
reads
as
follows.
another
example
would
be
providing
a
materially
false
statement
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
that
significantly
obstructed
or
impeded
the
official
investigation
or
prosecution
of
the
instant
offense.
now
that
doesn't
mean
every
false
statement;
there
are
the
qualifications,
material
and
significant.
but
with
those
two
qualifications
it
could
apply
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
perhaps,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
within
that
second
level
of
range
the
district
court
can
take
into
account
the
concern
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--right.
it's
within
a
range.
but
an
enhancement
that
is
two
levels
up
has
to
be
two
levels
up.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
it
has
to
be
material.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
a
defendant,
for
example,
were
to
give,
you
know,
a
false
statement
about
his
weight--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
the...
a
matter
that
generally
might
affect
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
perhaps.
if
you--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if
you
define--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if
you
define
perjury
to
mean...
to
always
require
that
the
statement
be
material--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--then
you
wouldn't
have
perjury--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--without
there
being
material...
a
material
statement.
but
if
you
define
perjury
to
mean
any
false
statement,
then
a
false
statement
that
wouldn't
affect
the
outcome
would
fall
outside
that.
