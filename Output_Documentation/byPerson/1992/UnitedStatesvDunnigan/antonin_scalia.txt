what
was
the
situation
before
the
guideline?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume...
i
assume
she
is
subjected.
are
72-year-old
ladies
exempt
from
the
perjury
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
you
cannot
bring
a
perjury
prosecution
for...
for...
for
perjury
in
a
civil
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
suppose
you're
right
to
give...
how
many...
how
many
additional
years
did...
did
your
client
get
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she
would
have
gotten
10
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
61,
10
months.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
could...
it
could
amount
to
much
more
than
that,
as
we
heard
earlier,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
say
it's
5
years.
let's
say
somebody
gets
5
additional
years
in
jail
because...
because
a
judge
found
that
in
the
course
of
testifying
in
the
criminal
proceeding
he
perjured
himself.
i
suppose
you
have
a
point
that
to
get
somebody
for
perjury,
we
would
have
to
empanel
a
jury
and
find...
12
people
would
have
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
person
perjured
himself.
and
here
we're
giving
this...
this
person
5
years
without...
without
a
jury,
without
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
finding,
just
a
single
judge
finding
that
it's
probable
that
the
person...
i
think
you
have
a
point.
unfortunately,
it's
always
been
done
that
way,
and
therefore
does
not
seem
to
be
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larkin,
why
must
the
government
make
a
request?
as
i
read
the
guidelines
it
says
if
the
defendant
wilfully
obstructed,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
increase.
if
the
defendant
willfully
obstructed,
increase
the
offense
level
by
two
levels.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
quite
different.
you're
saying
he
won't
be
reversed
for
not
having
made
it
unless
the
government
asks
him
to
make
it.
but
that's
a
little
separate
question,
i
think,
from
whether
he
ought
to
make
it,
whether
the
government
asks
him
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
this
is
different
from
any
of
the
other
ones
that
he...
that
he
ought
to
make--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
how
it's
defined.
