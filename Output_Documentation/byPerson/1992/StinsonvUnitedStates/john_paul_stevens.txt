justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
--just
make
it
clear
to
me,
what
precisely
are
you
asking
the
court
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
justice
white
was
suggesting
too,
i
think.
well--
--i
mean
it's
not--
--you
think...
you
think...
you
think
that
we
ought
to
remand
it
in
a
manner
that
the
court
of
appeals...
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
would
finally
win.
