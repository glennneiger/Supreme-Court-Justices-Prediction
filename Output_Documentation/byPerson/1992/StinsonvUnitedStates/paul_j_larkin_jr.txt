mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
the
sentencing
commission's
interpretation
of
its
guidelines
is
entitled
to
deference
from
the
courts.
in
fact,
we
probably
take
an
even
more
pro-deference
position
than
the
petitioner
does.
in
our
view,
the
court
should
give
effect
to
the
sentencing
commission's
interpretations
of
its
own
guidelines
in
the
same
way
that
the
courts
would
give
effect
to
a
federal
agency's
interpretations
of
its
own
legislative
rules.
in
fact,
we
think
that's
a
reasonable
place
to
start
to
analyze
this
problem.
the
sentencing
guidelines
can
reasonably
be
analogized
to
a
federal
agency's
legislative
rules.
after
all,
the
guidelines
are
not
just
a
collection
of
advice
to
district
courts
about
how
to
impose
sentence
in
criminal
cases.
on
the
contrary,
as
this
court
explained
in
the
mistretta
case,
the
sentencing
guidelines
bind
courts
in
the
exercise
of
their
sentencing
authority,
such
as
the
federal
rules
of
criminal,
civil,
and
appellate
procedure
bind
courts
in
the
management
and
disposition
of
the
cases
before
them.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
for...
for
this
sort
of
purpose,
your
honor,
they
would
be
treated
in
the
same
way.
there
are
differences
under
the
sentencing
reform
act
between
guidelines,
policy,
and
policy
statements.
for
example,
there
are
certain
times
when
congress
will
refer
to
guidelines
and
other
times
when
congress
will
refer
to
policy
statements.
for
example,
in
one
of
the
statutes
that
we've
cited
that
is
relevant,
we
think,
to
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case,
section
3582(c)(2),
which
we
have
reprinted
in
our
appendix
beginning
at
page
5a,
congress
has
set
forth
a
procedure
that
is
to
be
followed
so
that
a
sentence
that
is
already
imposed
can
thereafter
be
reduced
if
the
sentencing
commission
reduces
the
offense
level
for
that
sentence.
if
you
flip
over
to
page
6a,
in
subsection...
what
is
(c)(2)
towards
the
bottom,
you
will
see
that
it
says,
skipping
down
through
part
of
it,
"the
court
may
reduce
the
term
of
imprisonment
after
considering
the
factors
set
forth
in
section
3553(a).
"
that's
in
title
18,
"to
the
extent
that
they
are
applicable.
"
and
"if
such
a
reduction
is
consistent
with.
"
here's
the
phrase,
"applicable
policy
statements
issued
by
the
sentencing
commission.
"
so
in
that
context,
congress
clearly
has
specified
a
policy
statement
and
the
commission
has
implemented
that
demand...
that
command
from
congress.
what
the
sentencing
commission
did
was
adopt
a
policy
statement,
which
we
have
also
reprinted
in
our
brief...
that's
in
the
appendix
that
is,
and
that's
at
page
9a.
it's
section
1b1.10
of
the
guidelines
manual
and
it
governs
the
situations
in
which
a
retroactive
application
of
a
guideline
or
a
policy
statement
amendment,
or
commentary,
we
think,
should
be
covered.
that,
we
think,
is
the
way
congress
has
generally
set
out
the
sort
of
problem
that
ultimately
we
have
in
this
case.
one
way
to
look
at
it,
as
the
term
has
been
used,
is
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
retroactivity.
the
threshold
question,
however,
is
one,
like
i
said,
we
with...
one
with
which
we
agree
with
the
petitioner.
we
didn't
argue
to
the
contrary
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
rehearing
stage.
in
fact,
our
submission
at
the
rehearing
stage
in
the
eleventh
circuit
was
that
it
ought
not
to
apply
this
amendment
because
the
amendment
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
and
so
the
position
we've
taken
here
in
this
court
is
the
position
that
the
department
believes
best
implements
the
sentencing
reform
act
and
best
uses
the
available
types
of
judicial
doctrines
in
a
manner
that
makes
it
efficient
and
reasonable
for
the
courts
to
apply.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
i
think...
i
think
the
commission
is
using
the
term
legislative
history
perhaps
in
a
different
way
than
this
court
is.
the
legislative
history
oftentimes
will
sometimes
explain
how
a
statute
is
to
be
implemented.
that
happened
frequently
with
respect
to
the
sentencing
reform
act.
there
was
a
rather
comprehensive
report
by
the
senate
committee
that
was
issued...
that
accompanies
the
sentencing
reform
act,
and
it
gave
rather
a
elaborate
explanation
of
how
the
congress
thought
its
provisions
would
work.
and
in
this
case,
i
think
what
the
sentencing
commission
is
getting
at
is
when
we
issue
an
explanation
of
how
a
guideline
should
be
implemented,
you
should
look
to
it
the
same
way
you
look...
you
would
look
to
a
legislative
report
explaining
how
a
statute
is
to
be
implemented.
i
don't
think
they
meant
to
say
that
since
legislative
history
is
normally
disregarded,
you
should
normally
disregard
what
we've
had
to
say.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
oh,
well
it...
it
may...
it
is
of
lower
force
than
the
guideline
itself,
because
the
commentary--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
commentary
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
guideline.
i
mean
under
the
standard
this
court
has
followed
since
the
seminole
rock
case,
if
an
agency's
interpretation
is
inconsistent
with
the
text
of
the
rule
the
agency--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--has
implemented,
then
the
agency's
interpretation
won't
be
applied.
but
we
think
you
should
look
at
an
agency's
interpretation
under
that
standard
across
the
board,
because
what
you
have
in
a...
in
a
circumstance
is
a
manual
that
a
district
court
has
to
apply
at
a
particular
case.
it
will
have
guidelines,
it
will
have
policy
statements,
and
it
will
have
what
sometimes
are
called
application
notes
or
backgrounds,
and
those
explain
how
the
different
guidelines
and
policy
statements
are
to
be
applied.
we
think
it's
eminently
reasonable
to
give
deference
to
the
commission's
interpretation
of
how
those
guidelines
and
policy
statements
should
be
applied.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
like
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
rule,
if
i
can
change
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
not...
not
equivalent
to
the
rule,
but
like
an
agency's
interpretation
of
the
rule,
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
so
we
think
that
is
a
reasonable
way
of
looking
at
the
generic
issue
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no.
under
this
court's
decision
in
seminole
rock,
the
agency's
interpretation
is
given
considerable
deference.
and
unless--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--your
honor,
we've
always
taken
the
position
that
unless
the
agency--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--your
honor,
we've
always
taken--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
we...
we've
always
taken
the
position
that
that...
unless...
that
interpretation
is
binding
unless
it's
inconsistent
with
the
text
of
the
regulation,
relevant
statute--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--or
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
oh.
oh,
absolutely.
i...
there
is
always
that
circumstance.
an
agency
can't
adopt
a
regulation
that
says
something
is
black
and
then
interpret
it
as
meaning
white.
no,
no,
we...
we
wouldn't
take
that
position.
but
an
agency's
interpretation
is
entitled
to...
to
considerable
deference,
and
we
think
that
rule
should
be
applied
here,
and
for
that
reason
we
disagree
with
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
judgment
in
this
case
has
to
be
reversed,
because
we
think
there
is
another
rule
that's
applicable
here,
one
that
also
has
been
discussed,
and
we
think
that
rule
governs
the
proper
disposition
of
the
judgment
in
this
case.
and
that
is
as
follows:
the
sentencing
reform
act
directs
district
courts
to
apply
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
and
the
act
goes
on
to
direct
the
courts
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
district
courts
misapplied
the
guidelines.
the
result
is
that
a
sentence
that
is
correctly
imposed
under
the
version
of
the
guidelines
that
are
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing
is
not
retroactively
rendered
erroneous
because
the
commission
thereafter
amends
the
guidelines.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
they
did
not
address
the
retroactivity
issue.
they
addressed
this
other
issue
dealing
with
the
status
of
commentary.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
would
say
that...
that's
incorrect.
i
don't
think
they
would
have
said
that
this
has
to
be
applied
in
this
case
at
this
stage.
we
certainly
think
that
would
be
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
way
the
guidelines
are
to
be
implemented,
and
we
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
endorsed
those.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
the
amendment,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it...
it
actually
did
several
things.
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well
i
think
it's...
as
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
it's
a
clarification
of
how
the
new
system
is
to
be
implemented.
the
new
system
has
three
different
relevant
guidelines
now.
the
guideline
that
was
litigated
in
all
the
old
cases
was
the
career
offender
guideline.
there
was
one
revision
to
that;
they
changed
the
commentary
to
say
that
felon-in-possession
offenses
will
no
longer
be
treated
as
crimes
of
violence
for
purposes
of
the
career
offender
guideline.
but
there
were
revisions
to
two...
there
were
two
other
guidelines
that
have
to
be
considered
too.
one
deals
with
the
crime
of
firearms
possession.
as
to
that,
the
sentencing
commission
reshuffled
and
greatly
increased
the
base
offense
levels
to
index
them
according
to
a--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--a
defendant's
prior
record.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
then
they
adopted
an
entirely
new
guideline
to
implement
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
right.
they've...
they've
done
both.
they've
changed
the
commentary
in
one
respect
and
they've
adopted
legislative
rules--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
the
way
it
works--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it...
it's
not
applied
retroactively
to
cases
pending
on
direct
appeal.
there
is
a
separate
and
special
procedure
to
be
followed
for
retroactive
application,
and
that's,
i
think,
critical
to
keep
in
mind
here.
the
court
of
appeal...
basically,
the
way
it
works
is
as
follows.
the
district
court
sentenced
the
defendant
by
using
this
book.
this
was
the
book
in
effect
in
1989
when
the
defendant
came
up
for
sentencing
in
july
of
1990.
two
books
later
came
amendment
433
when
this
case
was
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
statute
says
the
district
court
is
to
apply
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
review
that
job
by
the
district
court.
so
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
look
to
the
manual
that
the
district
court
applied,
not
to
a
later
manual,
not
to
later
commentary
in
that
manual,
policy
statements
in
that
manual,
guidelines
in
that
manual.
it's
to
look
to
the
manual
the
district
court
applied.
now,
you
can
sometimes
have
what's
called
a
retroactive
application
of
an
amendment,
but
that's
a
different
procedure
entirely
and
it
doesn't
affect
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
could,
your
honor.
technically,
that
would
be
the
minimum
necessary
to
resolve
the
judgment
here.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
however,
we
think
it
would
be
very
efficient
and
very
valuable
to...
to
all
of
the
lower
courts,
to
instruct
them
as
to
how
the
amendment
process
should
be
considered
when
the
case
is--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
they
would...
they
would
have
to
do
more
than
just
what
they've
done
here,
because
what
they
would
have
to
do
is,
once
again,
modify
the
policy
statement.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
in...
in
the
retroactive
procedure
we've
described
in
the
last
section
of
our
brief.
i
mean,
they've
already
done
that.
there's
really
nothing
else
for
the
commission
to
do.
what
you
have
in
this
procedure,
really,
is
a
mechanism
for
reopening
a
final
sentence.
it
begins
in
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
but
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
why
there's
a
difference,
because
there's
a
different
standard
of
review
that
applies.
if
a
case
is
on
direct
appeal,
an
appellant
can
obtain
a
reversal
if
he
can
show
that
there
was
an
error
below.
under
this
reopening
mechanism
that
congress
has
set
out
and
that
the
commission
has
set
out,
the
standard
of
review
would
be
whether
the
district
court
has
abused
its
discretion.
it's
a
different
standard
and
the
reason
is
when
someone
applies
for
a
retroactive
modification
of
his
sentence,
the
district
court
is
not
required
to
modify
that
sentence
retroactively.
it's
required
to
consider
it,
of
course,
but
it
has
the
discretion
and
it
can
decide
that
even
though
the
sentencing
commission
has
lowered
the
base
offense
level
for
his
crime,
that
the
court
would
have
imposed
the
same
sentence
nonetheless.
i
mean
this
case
illustrates
that.
if
you
look
at
page
75
of
the
joint
appendix
you'll
see
the
statement
of
reasons
given
by
the
district
court
as
to
why...
excuse
me,
statement
of
reasons
at
page
84.
statement
of
reasons
at
page
84
is
why
the
district
court
imposed
the
sentence
at
the
upper
end
of
the
guidelines,
and
it
believed
that
a
sentence
at
the
upper
end
of
the
guideline
range
was
necessary
because
the
defendant
had
a
history
of
violent
behavior.
the
court
earlier,
at
page
75,
had
said
unless
there
were
a
very
stiff
sentence
imposed
on
this
defendant,
the
court
would
have
considered
departing
upwards
from
the
guidelines
range.
so
what
you
have
is
a
case
here
where
the
district
court
has
said
this
is
a
person
that
needs
a
long
term
of
incarceration.
if
a
retroactive
application
motion
were
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
might
deny
it
on
the
ground
that,
no,
this
sentence
is
appropriate
for
this
defendant.
so
that's
why
i
emphasize
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
applying
an
amendment
on
the
direct
appeal
process
and
applying
it
in
this
process.
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right,
it
would.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
because
here
we
have
a
statute
that
sets
out
the
relevant
agency's
interpretation.
and
it's
to
be
considered
the
statute--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
no.
here
the
reason
that
congress
has
set
out
a
specific
manual,
as
it
turns
out,
to
be
applied.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
is
that
the
commission
has
a
continuing
responsibility
to
revise...
to
monitor
the
implementation
of
the
guidelines,
make
revisions
where
necessary,
and
to
have
those
revisions
injected
into
the
stream
of
cases
that
are
being
decided.
if
you
retroactively
applied
every
revision
that
came
along,
you
would
needlessly
burden
the
system
in
cases
where
the
commission
didn't
believe
that
prior
adjudications
were...
were
erroneous
or
unjust.
if
the
commission
believes
prior
adjudications
are
erroneous
or
unjust,
it
has
a
relief
mechanism
available.
that's
the
one
we've
discussed
in
1b1.10,
the
retroactive
modification
of
a
final
sentence.
it
goes
through
that
procedure.
that's
the
procedure
congres
and
the
commission
have
set
forth
to
take
the...
the
case
you've
mentioned
into
account.
if
the
commission
believes
that
its
provision--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--should
be
applied
to
john
smith's
case
or
the
whole
series
of
john
smith
cases
that
come
out
or
that
have
come
out
already,
it
can
retroactively
apply...
have
its
amendment
applied
through
this
process.
but
you
don't
just
automatically
enter
it
into
the
appellate
review
process.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
purpose
of
the
analogy
we're
drawing
is
to
the...
to
the
substantive
weight
to
be
given
to
the
agency's
interpretations.
and
the
problem
you're
talking
about
is
really
more
a
procedural
or
timing
one.
we
think
there
really
isn't
any
great
inconsistency
between
them
such
that
our
submission
that...
with
which
we
agree
with
the
petitioner,
is
not
somehow
rendered
implausible
by
virtue
of
the
matter
you've
discussed.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
