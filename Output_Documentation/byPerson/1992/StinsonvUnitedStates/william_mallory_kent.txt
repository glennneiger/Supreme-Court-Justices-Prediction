mr.
william
mallory
kent
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
framed
the
question
presented
in
mr.
stinson's
case
as
whether
a
court's
failure
to
follow
sentencing
guideline
commentary
that
gives
specific
direction
that
the
offense
of
unlawful
possession
of
a
firearm
by
felony
is
not
a
crime
of
violence
under
sentencing
guideline,
section
4b1.1,
and
seeing
section
4b.1.2's
commentary
note
to
whether
that
failure
constitutes
an
incorrect
application
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3742
(f)(1).
first,
some
background,
the
chronology.
mr.
stinson
committed
his
crimes,
which
included
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
unlawfully,
in
october-november
of
1989.
mr.
stinson
was
sentenced
in
july
of
1990,
applying
the
november
1989
sentencing
guideline
manual,
section
4b1.1,
and
the
district
court
treated
the
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
charge
as
the
necessary
predicate
for
the
career
offender
provision
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
then,
in
october
of
1991,
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
sentence,
affirmed
the
sentence
of
a
career
fender...
offender,
treating
the
predicate
offense
of
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon
as
a
crime
of
violence.
then
just
days
after
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
came
out
affirming
the
sentence,
on
november
1st,
1991
the
united
states
sentencing
commission
issued
clarifying
commentary,
and
that
was
amendment
433
stating
that
it
was
the
sentencing
commission's
intent
that
the
definition
of
crime
of
violence,
for
career
offender
purposes,
did
not
include
the
crime
of
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon.
in
a
timely
manner,
before
mr.
stinson's
judgment
and
sentence
was
final
on
appeal,
mr.
stinson
petitioned
for
rehearing
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
basing
his
petition
for
rehearing
on
this
clarifying
amendment.
in
march
of
1992
the
eleventh
circuit
in
an
opinion
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing,
holding
that
the
eleventh
circuit
would
not
be
bound
by
sentencing
commission
commentary.
this
court,
in
williams
v.
united
states
just
last
term,
held
that
a
court's
failure
to
follow
sentencing
commission
policy
statements
can
result
in
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
under
section
3742(f).
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
that
is--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes,
this
court
should
decide.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
no,
it
did
not,
but
the
question
is
necessarily
subsumed
in
the
question
that
has
been
accepted
for
cert
by
this
court.
the
justice
is
correct
that
the
government
has
conceded,
in
effect,
that
mr.
stinson's
position
is
correct,
that
commentary
should
have
controlling
weight.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes,
justice.
i
would
not
refer
to
it
as
retroactivity.
our
position
is
that
the
commentary,
as
clarifying
commentary...
by
definition,
clarifying
means
that
the
sentencing
commission
was
intending
to
explain
what
the
meaning
of
this
guideline
was.
that
is,
what
the
meaning
of
this
guideline
was
at
the
time
mr.
stinson
was
sentenced
in
july
of
1990.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
justice
scalia,
if
the...
if
the
sentencing
commission's
characterization
was
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
act
that
it
took,
then
this
court
would
not
be
bound
by
it.
but
i
think
that
the
position
that
the
government
has
advanced,
that
the
commentary
of
the
sentencing
commission
has
controlling
weight
and
must
be
deferred
to
by
the
courts
unless
it
is
clearly
erroneous
or
plainly
inconsistent
with
the...
with
the
law,
that
same
position
requires
this
court,
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
to
give
deference
to
the
sentencing
commission's
characterization
of
this
particular
clarifying
amendment.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
justice
o'connor,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
first,
the
sentencing
commission
has
twice
described
this
commentary
as
clarifying.
and
in
the
second
time
that
it
was
addressed--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--justice
o'connor,
it's
our
position
that
this
clarification
is
drawn
out
from
the
definition
that
went
into
effect
in
november
of
1989.
there
has
been
an
evolving
structure
of
guidelines
that
relate
to
firearm-related
offenses.
but
it's
our
position
that
there
has
never
been
the
intent,
as
least
since
november
of
1989,
by
the
sentencing
commission
and
by
congress
which
approved
the
guideline
definition
in
effect
in
november
of
'89,
that
the
career
offender
crime
of
violence
definition
was
intended
to
include
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a...
by
a
felon.
the...
there
was
only
one
change
in
the
definition
of
crime
of
violence
in
the
history
of
the
career
offender
provision.
that
change
in
definition
went
into
effect
november
of
1989,
and
that
change
of
definition,
november
of
1989,
was
an
attempt...
and
there's
further
commentary
that
accompanied
that
change
in
definition...
an
attempt
to
make
crime
of
violence
be
understood
from
a
generic,
or,
we'd
say,
a
per-se
approach,
and
to
limit
district
courts
from
looking
at
the
underlying
actual
conduct.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
if
i
may.
the
definition
that
was
incorporated
in
november
of
1989
was
taken
from
924(e),
title
18,
section
924(e),
the
armed
career
criminal
enhancement
statute.
and
that
definition
carried
over
from
924(e)
itself
is
a
definition
that...
i
don't
have
the
language
verbatim,
but
the
definition
begins
by
saying
that
a
crime
of
violence
for
924(e)
includes
an...
an
offense
involving
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
firearm
that,
and
then
the
definition
continues
with
a
conjunction.
there
has
to
be
some
additional
element,
some
acts
of
violence.
it's
our
position
that
the
clear
intent
of
the
sentencing
commission...
which
they've
tried
to
clarify
now
twice...
in
taking
over
than
924(e)
definition
was
to
adopt
a...
to
adopt
that
924(e)
definition
permanently.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
i
think
that
the
government...
if
justice
o'connor
is
referring
to
the
government's
argument
that
3553...
title
18,
3553
requires
a
sentencing
court
to
apply
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
effect--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--in
policy
statements
in
effect
on
the
date
of
sentencing,
it
reads
too
much
into
that
statute
to
say
that
that
governs
a
court
of
appeals'
application
of
post-sentencing
clarifying
commentary
or
policy
statements,
reads
too
much
into
the
statute.
the
sentencing
commission
itself,
in
guideline
1b1.11(b)(2),
has
acknowledged
this
sort
of
dichotomy
between
clarifying
and
nonclarifying
commentary,
and
has
directed
courts
to
apply
clarifying
commentary.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
judicial
review
of
course.
i
mean
the
court
will
determine...
make
it's
own
determination
finally.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
our
position
that
the
characterization
of
the
sentencing
commission
is
owed
great
deference
if--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--unless
it's
plainly
inconsistent
with
what
the
sentencing
commission's
done.
for
example,
in
november
of
1989
the
sentencing
commission
did
change
its
commentary
with
reference
to
the
definition
of
crime
of
violence.
previously,
courts
were
directed
in
the
commentary
to
look
to
the
underlying
conduct
and
to
see
whether
there
were
acts
of
violence
in
the
actual
conduct.
an
example
was
given
of
an
escape,
and
the
courts
were
directed
in
the
commentary
to
look
to
the
actual
conduct.
was
the
escape
a
violent
escape
by
the
acts
that
were
committed
or
not?
that
commentary
was
also
changed
in
november
of
1989,
and
the
courts
were
limited
to
look
at
the
count
of
conviction,
the
language
in
the...
in
the
indictment.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
that's
a
change.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
they
can.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
sentencing
commission
already
has...
has
handled
the
rest
in
amendment
461
where
the
sentencing
commission
in
september
of
1992--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--well,
justice
scalia,
i...
i
believe
the
sentencing
commission
has
tried
to
express
that
already
in
amendment
461
where
the
sentencing
commission
directly
referred
to
this
case,
stinson,
and
reiterated
their
explanation
that
the
amendment,
433,
was
clarifying.
this
was...
and
then
2
months
later
in
november
of
1992,
the
sentencing
commission
adopted
a
guideline,
1b1.11(b)(2),
which
explains
what
the
significance
of
this
word
"clarifying"
is,
and
the
courts
are
directed
to
apply
clarifying
amendments.
so
i
think
the
sentencing
commission
has
already
answered
the
question,
but
i
believe
the
eleventh
circuit's
unwilling
to...
to
abide
by
the
answer
the
sentencing
commission
has
given.
this
court
recently
granted
cert--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--their
holding
was
limited
to
their...
the
eleventh
circuit
will
not
follow
commentary
that
overrules
their
prior
precedent.
but
the
eleventh
circuit
has
just
recently...
this
court
granted
cert
in
a
case
called
morrill,
morrill,
versus
united
states.
and
in
a
memorandum
order
this
court
reversed
or
directed
the
eleventh
circuit
to
reconsider
a
case
called
jones,
united
states
v.
jones,
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
had
held
that
being
a
bank
teller
per
se
triggers
the
vulnerable
victim
enhancement
under
the
guidelines.
on
remand,
the
eleventh
circuit
en
banc
has
reversed
jones,
but
has
stated
that
the
eleventh
circuit
hasn't
decided
yet
whether
clarifying
commentary
has
to
be
applied
retroactively
or
not.
and
that
that
question
is
on
cert
before
the
supreme
court
in
this
case.
i
believe
this
court
needs
to
give
direction
at
this
time
on
that
issue.
and
the
issue
is
necessarily
subsumed
within
the
question
that
was
presented
by
the
court
in
its
reformulation
of
the
issue.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
it
could
be--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--well,
yes,
justice
scalia,
you
yourself,
in
the
braxton
opinion,
deferred
to
the
sentencing
commission,
of
course,
on
a
question
on
which
cert
had
already
been
granted,
because
the
sentencing
commission
had
agreed
to
take
up
that
issue.
but
here,
to
repeat
myself,
i
think
the
sentencing
commission
already
has
addressed
this
issue
and
has
given
the
answer,
and
i
would
simply
ask
this
court
to
follow
that
answer
in
its
instruction
for
the
remand.
that
is
the
remand
instruction
should
require
the
court
to
apply
this
clarifying
commentary
to
stinson's
sentence
because
stinson's
sentence
was
not
yet
final
on
appeal
at
the
time
the
commentary
came
out.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
justice
white,
that
gets
into--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--well,
under
3582
in
guideline
1b1.10,
in
which
the
sentencing
commission,
in
amendment
461,
has
said
that
this
amendment
may
be
applied
retroactively
under
1b--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--may.
it's
our
position
that
that
only
controls
those
cases
which
were
not
yet
final
on
appeal.
stinson's
judgment
and
sentence
was
not
final
on
appeal,
a
distinction
that
this
court's
recognized
before.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
here
and
also
his
appeal
before
the
eleventh--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--yes,
your
honor.
but
also,
i
believe
the
original
amendment,
433
itself,
which
was
characterized
by
the
sentencing
commission
as
clarifying,
that
amendment
came
out
before
stinson's
sentence
was
final
on
appeal,
we
had
not
run
past
our
21-day
period
for--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--yes,
sir.
but
we
still
had
a
right
to
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
which
had
not
expired.
i
believe
that
the
government
is
seeking
here
to
frustrate
the
intention
of
the
sentencing
commission
and
thereby
indirectly
frustrate
congress'
intention
that
the
courts
defer
to
the
direction
of
the
sentencing
commission.
when
the
sentencing
commission
provides
an
interpretation
of
the
sentencing
commission's
own
guideline,
the
court
should
give
great
deference
to
that.
and
here
this
amendment,
in
which
the
sentencing
commission
has
attempted
to
clarify
the
meaning
and
effect
at
the
time
of
stinson's
sentencing,
the
sentencing
commission
itself
has
said
that
that
amendment
was
meant
to
be
clarifying.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
which
is
the
very
reason
the
clarifying
amendment
was
necessary.
the
commission
is
authorized
by
statute,
it's
mandated
to
review
and
revise
the
guidelines.
and
in
light
of
the
decisions
from
the
courts
of
appeal,
here
there
was
clear
confusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
term
"crime
of
violence
for
career
offender
purposes.
"
and
there
hadn't...
there
was
not
a
unanimity
among
the
decisions.
i
might--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--note
also
that,
as
the
government
itself
notes
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
my
original
petition
for
cert,
two
circuits,
that's
the
first
circuit
in
bell
v.
united
states
and
the
fifth
in
shano
v.
united
states,
have
already
applied
this
amendment
retroactively,
so
to
speak.
that
is
they
applied
it
to
sentences
that
were
imposed
prior
to
the
date
of
the
amendment.
also,
this
court,
when
it
granted
cert
in
kyle
v.
united
states
last
june,
i
believe
that
the
record
on
that
case
would
show
that
kyle
was
sentenced
in
the
fifth
circuit
before
the
amendment,
and
yet
this
court
vacated
his
sentence
in
light
of
the
clarifying
amendment.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
no,
sir,
justice
white,
he
does
not.
but
the
reason
for
that
is
there's
a
special
statute,
title
18,
section
109,
which
would
require
the
application
of
prior--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--the
congress
could.
and
congress
has
given
the
sentencing
commission
that
authority.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
exactly,
justice
white.
i
believe
this
is
just...
as
justice
scalia
said
in
braxton,
noted
that
the
sentencing
commission
was
given
this
unusual
power
to
decide
even
that
sentences
could
be
reduced
retroactively,
and
that
is
what's
been
done
in
this
case.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
remand
this
case
to
the
eleventh
circuit
with
instructions
that
amendment...
clarifying
amendment
433
be
applied
to
stinson's
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
again:
the
point
that
justice
scalia
was
making,
i
think
i
addressed
this
or
the
second
circuit
has
in
the
carter
case,
and
this
is
at
page
29
of
my
brief.
and
i
quoted
from
the
opinion
in
which
the
court,
second
circuit,
stated
"effective
november
1,
1992,
a
revision
to
section
1b1.10(d)
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
establishes
retroactively
that
a
felon-in-possession
conviction
under
section
922(g)(1)
is
never
a
crime
of
violence
for
purposes
of
section
4b1.1.
"
thereby
undercutting
the
government's
position.
after
oral
argument
and
upon
learning
of
this
revision,
the
government
informed
this
court
that
it
does
not
oppose
remand
or
resentencing
in
conformity
with
this
guideline's
amendment.
accordingly,
we
remand
for
resentencing.
now,
it's
not
absolutely
clear
what
the
second
circuit
meant
by
that,
but
i
believe
that
what
that
meant
was
that
they
were
remanding
for
resentencing
in
conformity
with
the
amendment
and
that
the
defendant/appellant
would
be
sentenced
not
as
a
career
offender.
he
was
not
being
remanded
under
3582.
and
mr....
or
the
government
itself
just
noted
in
its
argument.
it
said
that
this
procedure...
3582,
title
18,
section
3582
which
authorizes
the
sentencing
commission
to
determine
which
guideline
reductions
would
be
applied
retroactively
under
guideline
1b1.2.
the
government
argued
that
that
is
a
method
for
reopening
a
final
sentence.
and
that's
my
point
exactly,
that
mr.
stinson's
sentence
was
not
yet
final
on
appeal.
mr.
stinson
does
not
have
to
resort
to
this
discretionary
remedy
under
3582.
and
it
is
discretionary
and
the
government
itself
is
arguing
that
he
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
in
his
favor.
he
doesn't
have
to
resort
to
that
discretion.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
we
could
seek...
we
could
petition
the
district
court.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
that's
correct.
and
it's
also--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--not
only
do
we
not
want
to
have
to
do
it,
we
believe
that
mr.
stinson's
entitled
to
the
law
in
effect
to
be
applied
to
his
sentence
or
his
appeal
before
his
sentence
is
final.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
exactly.
now,
as
to
whether
this
court
should
dispose
of
this
issue
simply
by
taking
the
government's
concession
and
remanding
up
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
determine,
then,
what
it
will
do
once
it's
directed
that
commentary
or
at
least
this
particular
commentary
has
controlling
weight.
the
eleventh
circuit,
though,
hasn't
decided
yet
what...
how
clarifying
commentary
is
to
be
applied.
justice
white
noted
in
dissenting
to
the
denial
of
cert
in
the
case
of
early
v.
united
states
back
in
october
of
1991
that
although
the
clear
majority
of
the
circuits
are
applying
clarifying
commentary
retroactively,
so
to
speak,
not
all
of
them
are.
and
although
the
eleventh
circuit
has
on
occasion...
i
noted
one
in
my
brief,
gardiner,
and
there's
been
a
subsequent
case,
dedecker,
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
has
applied
clarifying
commentary
retroactively,
at
least
as
recently
as
this
morrill
case--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--well,
we
would
come
up
against
the
problem,
though,
justice
white,
of
does
this
particular
commentary...
i
mean
this
is
the...
the
problem
addressed
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
and
it's
a
question
necessarily
subsumed
in
the
issue
under
which
cert
has
been
granted.
does
this
particular
commentary
apply
to
this
particular
defendant?
and
i
believe
the
issue
is
ripe
for
decision
by
this
court
now.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
it's...
it's
possible
that
the
district
court
could
have
imposed
a
worse
sentence.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
whether
this
commentary
is
clarifying
or
not.
and
if
it's
clarifying,
whether
it's
to
be
applied
retroactively
or
not.
i
think
that
question
is
before
this
court
now
and
this
court
can
decide
it.
perhaps
the
parties
should
be
invited
to
supplementally
brief
this
issue.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
no,
sir.
there's
no
way
to
know
that.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
precisely,
i'm
asking
the
court
to
vacate
mr.
stinson's
sentence,
to
remand
it
for
resentencing
with
instructions
that
this
commentary
is
clarifying
commentary
and
is
to
be
applied
to
his...
determination
of
his
sentence.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
well,
i
would
win
insofar--
mr.
william
mallory
kent
--well,
no,
justice
white.
ultimately
the
district
court
would...
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
impose
a
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
would
only
determine
whether...
the
proper
application.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
mallory
kent
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
