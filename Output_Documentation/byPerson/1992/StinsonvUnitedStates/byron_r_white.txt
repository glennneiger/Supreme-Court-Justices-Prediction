justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
sentencing
commission
has...
has
said
that
the
courts
may
apply
that
433
retroactively.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
it
say
"may"
or
"must"?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
which...
which
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
because
it
was
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
before...
it's
before...
that's
because...
because
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
filed
on
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
433.
i
thought
that
was
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
rehearing,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
every
court
of
appeals
that
had
dealt
with
the
question
had
decided
it
contrary
to
what
the
sentence...
sentencing
commission
said
it
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the...
what
if...
just
forget
about
the
guidelines
for
a
minute.
suppose...
suppose
someone
is
convicted
of
robbery
and
he's
sentenced
for
10
years
pursuant
to
a
statute
on
the
books.
and
while
his
conviction
is
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
legislature
lowers
the
sentence
for
robbery
of
this
kind,
this
specific
kind
of
robbery,
to
5
years.
does
the
defendant
have
any
recourse
to...
to
seek
a
5-year
sentence
rather
than
a
10?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
i
suppose
the
legislature
could
say
that...
and
this...
this
lowering
of
the
sentence
shall
be
applicable
to
all
pending
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
in
effect,
your
argument
is
that
this
is
exactly
what
the
sentencing
commission
has
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
didn't
know
courts
were
bound,
absolutely
bound
by
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't...
i
agree
with
that.
but
are
they...
as
a...
is
a
court
bound
to
accept
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
rule?
i
can't
imagine
that
they
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
want
to
put
out
a
new
regulation,
that
may
be...
that
may
be
something
else
again,
if
you
want
to
amend
the
regulation,
but
i
didn't
know
we
were
just
bound
by
an
agency's
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
interpretation
of
its
own
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we're
not
bound.
we're
not
bound
by
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
rule,
if
it's...
if
it's
flatly
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
but
that
you
would
say
they
would...
you
say
the...
that
this
commentary
was...
what
is
it,
a
433,
was
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
yeah.
you
say
that
was
an
amendment
of
a
guideline...
of
a
commentary.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
an
interpretation
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it...
as
relevant
here,
was
it
a...
i
thought
the...
i
thought
the
commission
thought
it
was
just
a...
a
clarification
or
an
interpretation
of
its...
of
the
guideline.
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
so
you
say
this
is
an
equivalent
to
a
brand
new
guideline
or
a
brand
new
commentary.
it's
sort
of
legislative.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they're...
and
that
that
kind
of
a
change
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though...
even
though
later
the...
the
commission
has
said
that
at...
the
courts
may
apply
it
retroactively.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
right
that
even
if
we
ruled
against
you
here,
that
you
would
not
be
completely
without
a
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
you
would
have
to
go
through
another
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
want
to
have
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't...
if
we
rule
for
you,
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals,
now
that
it
knows
the
commentary
is
binding,
remand
to
the
district
court
for
resentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it...
it
applies,
but
the
district
court
didn't
have
the
commentary
before
it,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
possible
that
even
with
the
commentary,
that...
that
the
district
court
would
have
imposed
the
same
sentence,
or
would
it
be
impossible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i...
i
can't
imagine
why
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't...
if
we
remanded
the
court
of
appeals,
why
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
decide
what
the
sentence
is.
it's
just...
there's
just
a
new
standards
that
for...
for
the
sentencer,
namely
the
district,
to
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
we
say
it's...
that
it's
retroactive
and
applies
to
this...
this
defendant,
but
we
don't
know
how
the
sentencer
would
sentence
the...
this
defendant
under
this
new
commentary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you...
you
object
to
the
notion
that...
that
the...
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
did
you
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
in
your
petition
for
rehearing,
remand
to
the
district
court
for
resentencing
under
the
new
guidelines--
justice
byron
r.
white
--under
the
new
commentary.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
