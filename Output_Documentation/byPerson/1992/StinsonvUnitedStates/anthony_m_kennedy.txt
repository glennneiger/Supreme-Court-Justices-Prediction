are
they
in
some
lower
hierarchy
than
policy
statements
or
are
they
treated
the
same
way
as
policy
statements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
now,
is...
is
all
commentary
like
an
agency
rule,
because
the
commentary...
the
sentencing
commission
has
to...
its
rules
on
commentary,
1b1.7,
says
that
some
commentary
is
treated
like
legislative
history,
and
we
don't
usually
think
of
that
as
being
binding
on
the
courts.
so
are
there
different
kinds
of
commentary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
a
legislative
report,
that...
that's
different
than
an
agency
rule.
and
i
thought
your
position
in
your
brief,
and
that
you've
explained
here
at
the
outset,
is
that
this
is
like
an
agency
rule.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
some
commentary,
if
it's
like
a
legislative
report,
is
at
a
lower
form
of...
of
legitimacy
and
force
than
other
commentary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
yeah.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
is
it...
is
it
fair
for
me
to
say
that
your
position
is
that
all
commentary
should
be
treated
like
an
agency
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
commentary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that,
of
course,
was
not
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
in
this
case.
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals...
tell
me
if
you
think
this
is
correct...
there's
nothing
in
that
opinion
which
indicates
that
it
would
not
have
applied
the
commentary
if
it
had
thought
that
it
were...
if
it
had
not
thought
it
was
not
binding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
read
the
opinion
as
indicating
that
if
they
had
acknowledged
that
it
were
binding,
they
would
have
applied
it
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
is
that
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
opinion
here?
