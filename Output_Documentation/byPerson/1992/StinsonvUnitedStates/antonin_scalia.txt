that
may
well
be,
but...
but
congress
can
enact
a
piece
of
legislation
which
it
calls
clarifying
legislation
and
we
will
not
apply
that
retroactively.
they
can...
they
can
call
it
that,
but
if,
in
fact,
we
had
interpreted
the
prior
legislation
to
mean
x
and
the
clarifying
legislation
says
we
really
meant
it
to
mean
y,
or
at
least
that's
what
we
now
want
it
to
mean,
we're...
we're
not
going
to
go
and
apply
that
retroactively.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that...
i'm
sorry,
finish.
i
thought
you
were
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kent.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kent,
am
i
not
correct
that
the
sentencing
commission
itself
could...
could
clarify
all
of
this?
the
clarify...
the
sentencing
commission
could
say
when
we
said
clarifying,
we
meant
thus
and
so,
and
it
should
be
applied
that
way
retroactively?
can
they...
can
they
not
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
frankly,
i
was
content
to
let
them
do
that.
and
i
thought
that...
that
when
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
with
a
reformulated
question,
we
reformulated
the...
the
question
on
certiorari,
we
intended
to
exclude,
i
thought,
the
issue
of
what
exactly
the
commentary
meant,
whether
it
meant
clarify
in
the
sense
that
you
say
or
clarify
in
some
other
sense.
i
thought
the
only
question
we...
we
wanted
to
take
this
case
for
was
whether
a
court
must
follow
the
commentary,
whatever
the
commentary
might...
might
mean.
isn't
that
what
the
question
presented
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
we...
why
don't
we
just
talk
about
that
and
let
the
sentencing
commission
worry
about
all
the
rest?
couldn't
we
handle
this
case
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
that
may
be.
we
can
let
the
lower
court
figure
that
out.
we
can
just
decide...
tell
the
lower
court
you
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
commentary,
which
they
said
they
didn't
have
to
do
at
all,
and
then...
and
then
let
them
decide
what
the
commentary
means.
but
you're
asking
us
to
decide
what
the
commentary
means.
frankly,
that's
a...
that's
a
very
hard
question
and,
for
my
part,
i...
i
don't
want
to...
i
don't
think
we
should
spend
our
time
on
that.
i
think
that
the
sentencing
commission
should
spend
its
time
on
that.
it
has
full
power
to
make
those
decisions
retroactively.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
because
they...
not
because
they
disagree
with
you
about
the
meaning
of
"clarifying".
they...
they
were
much
more
categorical,
weren't
they?
they
just
say
we
don't...
we
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
commentaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
we
said
about
it
could
be
contradicted
by
the...
by
the...
by
the
sentencing
commission,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
we
could
come
out
with
a
decision,
the
sentencing
commission
could
say
no,
we
really
didn't
mean
that,
we
meant
the
opposite,
and
moreover
this
view
that
we
now
express
should
be
applied
retroactively,
right?
whereupon
our
decision
would
be...
would
be
a
nullity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larson,
what...
what
you're
proposing
to
us
is
really
not,
however...
i
don't
think
it
is...
the
way
we
would
apply
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulations.
if...
if
a
case
involving
a
regulation
is
on
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
while
it's
on
appeal
the
agency
issues
a...
a
new
regulation
or
a
policy
statement
interpreting
its
own
regulation,
or
there's
some
decision
of
the
agency
that
makes
clear
the
official
agency
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
wouldn't
either
one
of
two
things
happen?
number
one,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
itself
would
take
notice
of
that
new...
of
that
newly
issued
agency
interpretation
and
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
or
number
two,
remand
to
the...
to
the
trial
court
for
that
court
to
take
account
of
the
agency's
new
authoritative
interpretation.
isn't
that
the
way
it
would
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
this
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
we...
we
have
a
statute
that
says
the
trial
court
shall
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
law
at
the
time.
but
that
just
states
a
truism.
i
mean,
you
expect
the
same
thing
for
agency
regulations
too,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that
and
it
makes
sense.
but...
but
i'm
just
saying
it
really
is
not...
i
don't
believe
it's
the
way
we
would
treat
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation.
i
just
wonder
whether
the
analogy
you're
inviting
us
to
make
is...
is
a
sound
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
through
this
other
procedure
it's
discretionary
with
the
trial
court
whether
it...
whether
it
will
make
the
change
or
not.
