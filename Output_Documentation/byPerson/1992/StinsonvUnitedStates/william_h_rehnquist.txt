the
united
states.
mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william

rehnquist
can
one
tell
immediately
the
difference
between
clarifying
and
nonclarifying
commentary?
chief
justice

rehnquist
mr.
kent.
i'm
sorry.
if
the
sentencing
commission
describes
the
commentary
as
clarifying,
then
the
courts
ought
to
accept
it
if
it's
within
the
ballpark.

you,
