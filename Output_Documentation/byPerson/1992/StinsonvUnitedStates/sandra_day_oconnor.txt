well,
mr.
kent,
i
understand
the
government
to
essentially
agree
that
a
commentary
that
plausibly
interprets
the
guideline
is
binding
on
the
sentencing
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
agree
to
with
you
that
a
court's
failure
to
follow
such
a
commentary
would
be
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
think
the
government
then
says,
however,
here
any...
this
commentary
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
in
these
circumstances.
so
are
you
going
to
address
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
question
presented
and...
and
should
we
decide
it
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
below
didn't
address
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
this
case
may
turn
on
the
retroactivity
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
kent,
that
what
this
so-called
clarifying
commentary
describes
is
that
it
clarifies
the
new
and
now
current
sentencing
regime
for
felons
in
possession.
and
it
did
not,
it
seems
to
me,
clarify
the
former
regime
as
it
was
in
place
when
this
defendant
was
sentenced.
i
mean,
there
is
a
new
scheme
adopted
for...
for
felons
in
possession,
and
so
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
appropriate
at
all
to
apply
this
so-called
clarifying
commentary
to
this
defendant,
who
was
sentenced
under
the
old
regime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
what
does
it
clarify?
it
seems
to
me
it
clarifies
what
the
meaning
should
be
under
the
new
regime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
there
was
a
statute
that
tells
the
district
courts
to
apply
policy
statements
in
effect
on
the
date
the
defendant
is
sentenced.
there's
a
statute
that
tells
the
court
to
do
that
and
they've
done
that
here,
i
mean
presumably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
policy
statements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
larkin,
i
guess
what
we
could
do
here,
of
course,
is
just
agree
with
apparently
the
position
taken
by
both
of
you
that
the
court
below
got
it
wrong
in
saying
they
didn't
have
to
consider
the
commentary,
and
just
vacate
and
remand
and...
and
then
let
the
government
present
its
position
on
the
proper
application.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
if
we
were
to
do
that,
conceivably
the
sentencing
commission
could
come
along
again
and
say
no,
we
really
mean
for
all
courts
to
apply
this
notion
retroactively.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
could
do
that
and
then
the
courts
would
have
to
go
back
and
apply
it,
in
that
fashion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
the
defendant
would
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
make
his
application
there.
