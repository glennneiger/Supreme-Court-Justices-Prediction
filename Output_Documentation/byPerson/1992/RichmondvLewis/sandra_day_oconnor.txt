justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
case
is
richmond
against
lewis,
91-1794,
and
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
for
the
ninth
circuit.
an
arizona
trial
court
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
death
for
first
degree
murder.
the
sentencing
judge
found
three
statutory
aggravating
factors
including
the
so-called
"(f)(6)
factor"
that
the
offense
was
especially
heinous,
cruel,
or
depraved.
this
factor
was
unconstitutionally
vague
at
the
time
of
sentencing
but
was
given
an
adequate
narrowing
construction
prior
to
the
date
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
affirmed
the
petitioner's
sentence.
four
of
the
five
arizona
justices
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
voted
to
affirm.
two
of
the
justices
joined
a
principal
opinion
that
relied
on
the
especially
heinous
(f)(6)
factor.
the
two
concurring
justices
relied
only
on
the
remaining
aggravating
factors.
one
justice
dissented.
petitioner
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
the
federal
district
court
and
that
court
denied
relief.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
the
respondents
concede
that
arizona
is
a
so-called
weighing
state
where
the
sentencer
is
instructed
to
balance
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
they
also
concede
that
at
least
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
needed
to
conduct
a
proper
reweighing
in
order
to
cure
the
petitioner's
sentence
of
the
initial
vagueness
error
of
the
one
factor.
we
determine
that
the
two
concurring
justices
did
not
reweigh.
they
affirmed
the
death
sentence
simply
because
it
was
supported
by
other
valid
aggravating
factors
besides
the
(f)(6)
factor.
this
is
the
sort
of
automatic
affirmance
rule
that
we
have
previously
explained
in
clemons
versus
mississippi
and
other
cases
that
cannot
be
uphedl,
and
since
petitioner's
sentence
is
invalid
regardless
of
whether
the
principal
arizona
opinion
properly
relied
on
the
(f)(6)
factor,
we
do
not
address
that
issue.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
return
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
entry
of
a
conditional
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
