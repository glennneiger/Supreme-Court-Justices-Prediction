mr.
everett,
could
i
interrupt
you?
you
say
that
the
district
violates
all
the
principles
that
have
been
established
in
the
cases.
well,
it
doesn't
violate
the
one
person/one
vote
principle,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
one
person/one
vote
principle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me
what
principle
does
it
violate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
they
constitutional
principles?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
when
you
say
everything
else,
do
you
include
anything
other
than
compactness
in
the
concept
of
everything
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
district
is
entirely
contiguous,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
entirely
contiguous,
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
any
different
from
an
assumption
that
an
irish
catholic
will
vote
like
another
irish
catholic
and
they're
more
apt
to
vote
democratic
than
republican,
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
about
religious
stereotypes?
so
you
assume
that
all
the
jewish
people
will
vote
in
one
particular
way.
is
that
different
from
the
same
assumption
about
black
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
was
in
the
u.j.o.
case
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
remember
the
u.j.o.
case,
united
jewish
organization
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
drawing
lines
based
on
registered
republicans
as
opposed
to
registered
democrats,
making
an
assumption
they'll
vote
with
the
party?
can
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
make
a
stereotypical
assumption
that
they
won't
change
for
the
next
election
when
you
draw
your
lines.
is
that
really
different
from
any
other
kind
of
group
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
in
fact,
we
know
they
don't
always
vote
that
way,
just
as
we
know
that
republicans
don't
always
vote
for
republican
candidates.
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
deals
with
racial--
--yes,
but
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
did
we
fight
a
civil
war
about
republicans?
does
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
apply
to
republicans?
i
didn't
think
so.
you
don't
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
republicans?
you
think
it's
okay
for
the
sovereign
to
discriminate
against
republicans?
it's
very
interesting.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
take
justice
kennedy's
question
just
one
step
further.
supposing
just
as
a
matter
of
policy,
forgetting
the
voting
rights
act...
assume
no
voting
rights
act...
could
the
state
constitutionally
decide
that
when...
if
20
percent
of
the
population
is
of
a
particular
race,
that
it
would
be
good
policy
to
have
two
districts
in
which
that
race
represented
the
majority
of
the
voters
in
the
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
why
would...
what
would
make
it
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
is
that
proportional
representation
could
be...
by
race
could
be
adopted
by
a
state
as
a
matter
of
policy
quite
consistently
with
the
commands
of
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
i'm
still
not
entirely
clear
what
your
position
would
be
if
you
did
everything
exactly
the
same
and
there
were
no
voting
rights
act.
would
it
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is
it
would
be
constitutional--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--even
if
there
were
no
voting
rights
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
what
is
your
position
that
what
if
the
state
of
north
carolina
motivated
by
precisely
the
same
considerations
you've
just
described
adopted
this
program
on
its
own
without
there
being
a
voting
rights
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
same
facts
that
you
have
that
motivated
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
it
would
or
would
not
be
permissible
constitutionally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question,
if
you
do
have
a
moment?
what
if,
say,
a
city
like
chicago
decided
to
create
a
certain
number
of
wards
where
the
polish
vote
would
control?
would
your
standard
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
in
a
city
they
could
have
one
rule
for
the
polish
americans
and
a
different
rule
for
the
african
americans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
treating
polish
americans
is
not
a
stereotype.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
blacks
tend
to
live
together.
polish
americans
tend
to
live
together
in
chicago.
