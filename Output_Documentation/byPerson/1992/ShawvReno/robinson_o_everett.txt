mr.
robinson
o.
everett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
our
complaint
seeks
to
make
clear,
this
case
poses
the
basic
issue
of
how
far
a
legislature
may
go
in
seeking
to
guarantee
the
election
to
congress
of
persons
of
a
particular
race.
perhaps
the
best
evidence
is
here
in
the
form
of
the
map,
which
is
a
reproduction
in
color
of
a
map
which
was
earlier
lodged
with
the
court
at
page
133a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
pope
v.
blue,
and
there
are
a
number
of
copies
of
that
which
i
believe
are
before
the
court.
we
proceed
in
a
sense
on
the
theory
that
while
we
are
reluctant
to
use
political
pornography...
and
this
has
been
described
as
political
pornography,
but
really
the
only
way
to
understand
what
took
place
in
north
carolina
is
to
look
at
the
evidence
thereof.
and
our
complaint
seeks
briefly
to
set
forth
the
history
of
the
developments
in
our
state.
basically
the
attorney
general
in
the
summer
of
1991
and
in
the
fall
made
clear
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
two
majority-minority
districts.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
yessiree.
yes,
your
honor.
indeed,
it
was
attorney
general
william
barr
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
he
was
relying
on
the
voting
rights
act.
this
was
apparently
an
interpretation
of
the
voting
rights
act
which,
as
we
understand
some
of
the
recent
opinions
of
the
court,
was
erroneous.
at
least
that's
the
way
we
interpret
the
growe
case
and
the
voinovich
case.
but
in
any
event,
he
set
forth
preconditions.
basically,
as
we
allege
in
the
complaint,
the
precondition
for
clearing...
for
preclearing
the
north
carolina
plan
was
that
there
be
two
seats
which
would
be
guaranteed
for
election
of
african
americans
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
so
that
here,
in
a
sense,
we
oppose
the
issue
of
legal
segregation
of
the
congressional
delegation
of
north
carolina.
now,
north
carolina
is
a
state
where
the
minority
population
is
relatively
dispersed.
indeed,
we
have
also
lodged
with
the
court
various
data
pertaining
to
the
dispersion
of
the
population
throughout
the
100
counties
of
the
state.
most
of
the
black
population
is
concentrated
in
the
east
and
in
the
piedmont,
that
is
to
say,
along
the
coast
and
in
the
center
of
the
state.
interestingly,
there
are
only
five
counties
in
the
state
and
those,
with
one
exception...
and
that's
not
a
major
exception...
are
relatively
small
counties,
only
five
counties
in
which
there
is
a
majority
of
black
persons.
and
as
a
result,
after
the
first
plan
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--of
black
persons.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
interestingly,
those
are
counties
of
relatively
small
population
in
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state.
there's
one
county
which
i
would
say
is
mid-sized.
so,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
only
way
basically
to
achieve
this
objective
of
having
two
majority-minority
districts...
and
indeed,
these
are
super
majority-minority
districts
because
it's
not
51
percent.
there's
some
margin
for
error,
not
65
percent
as
in
the
u.j.o.
case,
but
moving
up
into
the
mid-50's.
the
only
way
to
achieve
that
was
to
violate
every
one
of
the
principles
of
redistricting
and
reapportionment
which
have
heretofore
been
accepted
by
the
court,
or
at
least
as
we
understand
it,
which
have
been
accepted
by
the
court.
we
harken
back
to
reynolds
v.
sims
where
there
was
a
reference
to
a
pattern
of
crazy
quilts
which
in
and
of
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
constitutionality
of
the
reapportionment.
we
harken
back
to
u.j.o.
itself
where
in
one
of
the
opinions...
i
believe
it
was
the
opinion
of
justice
white...
there
is
a
reference--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--it
violates
every
principle
except
the
principle
of
giving
a
majority...
to
preselecting--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--it
does
not
violate
the
one
person/one
vote.
that's
correct.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
it
violates
the
principles
of
compactness.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
would
submit
that
compactness
and
seeking
a
community
of
interest
is
a
constitutional
principle
and
that
at
least...
put
it
this
way,
your
honor...
that
it
is
not
permissible
to
disregard
everything
else
for
the
sole
purpose
of
targeting
that
the
seat
will
have
a
person
of
a
particular
race.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
i
include
contiguousness.
i
include--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
they're
contiguous
in
a
very
marginal
sense
of
the
word.
i
think--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--contiguous...
i
think
actually,
your
honor,
one
of
the
districts
is
cut
in
the
middle
by
district
12,
but
we
would
view
contiguousness
as
meaning
more
than
a
contact
at
a
point
so
that
we
would
suggest
that
if
there's
any
significance
to
contiguousness
other
than,
say,
a
point...
one
point
where
there
is
an
infinitesimal
contact,
that
it
violates
contiguousness.
certainly
compactness
it
violates
no
matter
what
the
test
is.
community
of
interest
it
violates.
take
the
12th
district,
which
is
the
one
that
has
received
quite
a
bit
of
attention
and
which
stretches
from
durham,
my
hometown,
to
gastonia.
it
snakes
along
interstate
i-85.
it's
described
by
judge
vorhees
in
his
dissent
in
the
lower
court.
it
snakes
along.
at
some
points
it
is
no
wider
than
i-85.
in
fact,
at
some
points
it's
no
wider
than
two
lanes
of
i-85.
you
can
go
from
one
side
of
the
highway
to
another,
and
you
go
from
one
district
to
another.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
we
came
at
it
from
an
entirely
different
viewpoint.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
assertion
was
predicated
on
political
gerrymandering.
there
was
no
assertion
that
this
was
done
for
the
sole
purpose
of
targeting
two
seats
for
persons
of
a
particular
race.
that
we
think
is
the
fatal
flaw.
we
think
that
perhaps
the
issue
of
compactness
could
have
been
raised
differently
in
that
case
and
there
might
have
been
some
constitutional
issues
before
you.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
even
in
search
of
diversity
in
the
congress,
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
and
the
attorney
general
can
go
only
so
far,
but
they
cannot
go
as
far
as
they
went
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
would
think
there
are
some
limitations
even
on
how
far
the
state
can
go
in
rejecting
the
principle
of
compactness.
we
certainly
would
say
this
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
perhaps
they
can
reject
compactness,
but
not
do
so
in
the
context
of
seeking
to
assure
the
election
of
a
person
of
a
particular
race,
whatever
that
race
may
be.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
that's
the
key
to
it,
justice
souter,
that
it
rests
on
the
motivation.
in
a
sense
the
distortions
are
a
reflection
of
the
motivation,
and
the
distortions
show
what
happens
once
we
start
down
the
path
to
what
might
be
termed
segregating
the
electoral
process
because--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
think
that
is...
that
the
motivation
is
the
independent
constitutional
grounds
for
invalidating
it.
we
would
contend
that
regardless...
it
goes
beyond
strict
scrutiny,
that
anytime
a
motivation
of
this
particular
type
is
that
which
dominates
the
legislative
purpose,
anytime
the
legislature
is
thinking
of
choosing...
of
drawing
boundaries
for
the
specific
purpose
of
assuring
that
persons
of
a
particular
race
will
be
elected,
then
under
those
circumstances,
it's
invalid.
now--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if
it
required--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
say
that
if
it
authorized
the
legislature
to
act
with
that
intent
and
if,
in
fact,
the
legislature
acted
with
that
intent,
that
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
40
counties.
there
are
40
counties
which
require
preclearance.
the
remaining
counties
would
not.
however--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--preclearance
was
required,
but
as
we
understand
it,
preclearance
does
not
change
the
basic
rules.
preclearance
does
not
mean
that
factors
such
as
those
in
gingles
are
totally
ignored.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
we
think
he
was
wrong
even
at
the
outset--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that
he
was
wrong
at
an
earlier
stage--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--in
requiring
that
there
be
the
majority-minority
districts.
as
we
understood
the
opinion
in
voinovich,
there
is
nothing
in
the
voting
rights
act
which
requires
that
there
be
particular
types
of
majority-minority
districts.
this
is
something
that
in
a
sense
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
state
so
long
as
the
state
does
not
violate
other
principles
in
a
manner
that
dilutes
the
vote.
now,
there
has
been
no
dilution
of
the
vote
in
this
particular
instance.
indeed,
it's
interesting
to
look
at
statistics
presented
in
the
brief
by
the
appellees.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
in
a
sense,
you
do--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i'll
say
yes.
i'll
say
yes,
you've
got
to
say
that--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--because--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--no,
i
don't
think...
i
would
disagree
with
you
on
that.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i
think
as
a
preliminary
point--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
to
focus
on
the
issue
that
the
court
presented,
the
legislature,
after
the
refusal
of
preclearance,
then
went
ahead
and
with
reckless
abandon
drew
something
that
apparently
was
not
in
line
with
the
suggestions
of
the
attorney
general
so
that--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--they
did.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
in
the
southeast,
yes.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
before
we
could
get
preclearance--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
had
to
have
two
districts.
they
had
to
be...
there
was
one
that
was
there.
there
had
to
be
another.
there
had
to
be
two
districts
which
would
guarantee
the
election
of
a
person
of
a
particular
race.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
we
would
contend
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
preclearance
admittedly,
but
that
a
plan
which
burdens
the
areas
that
are
not
subject
to
preclearance
and
unduly
burdens
them
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
would
say
it
would
not,
that
it
should
be
separated...
that
there
would
be
no
nexus
between
any
violation
and
the
purported
corrective
action.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
relatively
few
of
them
are,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
a
number
of
them
that
are
in
the
12th
district,
which
is
the
one
we
are
particularly
focusing
on,
are
not
subject
to
preclearance.
for
example,
durham
county
is
not
subject,
and
indeed,
durham
county
is
one
which
in
the
thornburg
case,
in
thornburg
v.
gingles,
was
accepted
because
the
political
process
was
not
operating
in
a
way
that
in
any...
that
diluted
the
minority
vote.
so,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
precleared
is...
the
preclearance
requirement
is
being
used
to
affect
adversely
areas
which
have
never
been
found
guilty
of
any
sort
of--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--it
was
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
we
brought
up
that...
and
we've
consistently
taken
the
position
that
to
manipulate
the
preclearance
requirement
for
the
40
counties,
primarily
in
the
northeast,
as
a
basis
for
covering
the
entire
state
with
a
plan
which
is
racially
discriminatory,
at
least
as
we
interpret
it,
is
beyond
the
purview
of
the
voting
rights.
we
took
the
position
in
our
original
complaint
that
what
was
done
was
not
authorized
by
the
voting
rights
act,
but
in
addition
and
more
fundamental
we
take
the
position
that
what
was
done
is
not
authorized
by
the
u.s.
constitution.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
that
is
basically
it.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
the
principle
to
some
extent
can
be
related
to
factors
such
as
those
in
the
gingles
case.
where
there
is
a
compactness
of
a
minority
group
and
it's
broken
aside...
broken
apart,
then
we
would
submit
that
the
voting
rights
act
could
authorize
race
conscious
corrective
action,
but
what
we're
concerned--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
think
that
would
at
least
be
one
dividing
line
and
one
that
would
not
permit
what
has
been
done
here.
but
i
suppose
our
basic
concern
is
with
the
state
of
mind
which
begins
with
the
proposition
that
you've
got
to
come
out
with
a
certain
result,
that
in
a
sense
is
demeaning
the
electoral
process.
it's--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
think
even
that
goes
too
far.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
our
line
is
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
something
very
specifically
that
was
done
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
minority,
breaking
up
a
natural
community
of
interest--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
think
it
may
be
a
situation
where
you
look
at
a
number
of
factors
and
decide
whether
the
paramount
purpose
was
to
achieve
a
particular
result.
if
you--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that's--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
i
perhaps
misspoke
myself
earlier
because
i
was
thinking
of
the
corrective
situation
where
something
has
been
done
on
racial
grounds
adverse
to
a
minority
group
as,
for
example,
breaking
apart
a
community
of
minority
persons
into
two
districts
and
thereby
basically
diluting
the
vote.
then
i
think
certainly
some
corrective
action
could
be
taken,
and
the
corrective
action
would
take
race
into
account.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i'm
thinking
of
a
community,
a
racial
community,
let's
say,
a
neighborhood.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
but
it's
not
predicated
on
the
stereotype
that
one
black--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that's
exactly
it.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
justice
souter,
that's
exactly
it.
the
assumption
here...
the
stereotype
underlying
this
is
that
a
black
in
durham
has
more
in
common
with
a
black
in
charlotte
than
that
black
does
with
a
white
living
across
the
street.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
it...
there
may
be--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--there
may
be
communities
of
interest,
but
i
think
that
basically
our
constitution
has
set
its
face
against
the
racial
stereotype.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
if
there
were
an
assumption
made
of
that
sort,
i
think
it
would
be
equally--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i'm
sorry?
i--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--in
the
u.j.o.
case,
i
don't
think
there
was
an
assumption
that
the
hasidic
jews
will
all
vote
as
a
community.
there
was
a
community
of
interest
in
a
geographic
community
which
was
set
apart,
but
there
was
something
more
than
any
sort
of
stereotype
that
one
hasidic
jew
was
exactly
like
another
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
i
think...
that's...
you
can
change
parties.
you
can
move
people.
parties
can
change
their
position,
but
race
is
fixed.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
political
gerrymandering
has
been
treated
by
the
court
different
than
the
racially...
racial
gerrymandering.
we
think
that
the
party
lines,
the
party
affiliations,
are
much
less
fixed.
we
should
note
here,
by
the
way,
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
something
that
is
being
put
in
place
for
the
rest
of
this
decade,
for
the
next
10
years,
as
a
result
of
this
stereotype,
and
the
result
of
the
stereotype
is
that
it's
being
assumed
that
one
black
will
vote
always
for
another
black
and
should
always
vote
for
another
black.
there's
a
targeting.
there's
a...
the
legislature
seems
to
be
approving
a
normative
principle.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
they
don't
always
vote
that
way,
but
this
is
an
encouragement
to
do
so.
this
is
a
legislative
affirmation
basically
that
they
should
do
so.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
not
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
i
suppose
they
could
delimit.
davis
v.
eandemer
teaches
us
that.
but
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
the
intent
certainly
is
entirely
different,
the
intent
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--that
has
been
my
assumption
from
your
opinions.
also
rural
versus
urban.
you
can
have
interests
of
that
sort
which
can
be
taken
into
account
within
the
parameters
of
the
one
person/one
vote
line
of
cases.
but
the
racial
distinction,
as
i
understand,
is
something
that
a
war
was
fought
to
get
rid
of.
there
are
a
line
of
opinions
of
this
court
which
in
one
way
or
the
other
have
inveighed
against
racial
classifications.
we
take
that
very
seriously.
we
take
the
color-blind
constitution
to
be
more
than
an
idle
aspiration,
particularly
under
present
conditions.
and
the
court
seems
to
be
moving
away
from
federal
supervision
in
such
matters
as
integration
of
the
schools,
the
freeman
v.
pitts
case,
the
recent
decisions
dealing
with...
well,
the
voinovich
case
and
the
growe
case
seem
to
indicate
a
willingness
to
move
things
back
to
the
local
level.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
a
federal
official
directed
that
the
north
carolina
redistricting
be
accomplished
to
achieve
a
particular
objective
for
a
purpose
that
was
constitutionally
invalid,
and
we
submit
that
relief
should
be
granted
and
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
i
think
we
are
still
standing
on
the
principle
of
the
color-blind
constitution
in
terms
of
inveighing
against--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
the
gingles
analysis,
if
it
were
applied
in
this
particular
instance,
would
not
permit
the
sort
of
result
that
was
achieved
here.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i
believe
we
would
accept
that
there
can
be
an
effort
to
avoid
any
future
dilution
so
long
as
it
is
not
done
with
a
view
to
having
a
particular
person
elected
of
a
particular
race.
that's--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
that
may
not
be
in
one
sense,
but
certainly,
as
we
view
it,
some
of
the
basic
concept
of
ignoring
racial
stereotypes...
that
we
view
as
an
essential
to
the
color-blind
constitution,
and
that
we
think
is
the
principle
that
has
been
violated
here.
may
i
reserve
my
remaining
time?
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
let
me
respond
first
to
the
last
remark
by
mr.
kneedler,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
position
seems
to
be
that
if
the
voting
rights
act
authorizes
something,
then
it
is
automatically
valid.
and
that
might
be
the
case
in
some
situations,
but
we
would
submit
not
in
the
situation
that
is
involved
here.
moreover,
it's
our
contention
that
the
voting
rights
act
did
not
cause
this
conduct,
that
it
was
done
by
misinterpretation,
and
it
was
done
by
a
misinterpretation
on
all
sides,
that
the
voting
rights
act
leaves
the
parties
free
to
choose
districts
other
than
majority-minority
districts,
but
there's
no
compulsion,
no
authorization
to
have
a
majority-minority
district.
and
our
complaint
very
basically
sets
forth
in
its...
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
we're
complaining
of
a
quota
system
of
a
proportional
representation
which
was,
in
fact,
being
forced
upon
the
congressional
delegation.
and
therefore,
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
powell
are
particularly
appropriate
because
that's
exactly
what
it
was,
to
have
a
quota
of
a
certain
number
of
members
of
congress
of
a
particular
race.
we
find
no
authorization
for
that
in
any
of
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court,
and
the
result
of
doing
that
is
to--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--section
2
has
a
specific
proviso.
so,
we
maintain
that
it's
not
authorized
by
the
congress,
that
it
is
not
authorized
by
the
constitution,
that
the
result
is
to
produce
the
type
of
distortion
that
was
reflected
in
the
map,
and
to
produce
a
process
that
is
inimicable
to
all
the
ideals
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
and,
indeed,
of
article
i,
section
2.
and
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
would
think
it
would
be.
i
don't
think
race
is
in
the
same
category.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
i
would
say
that
race
is
a
stereotype
which
is
so
much
frowned
upon--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--also,
actually
in
the
chicago
situation,
they're
living
in
neighborhoods.
it
would
probably
be
a
situation
of
an
actual
community
of
interest.
i
don't
think
anybody
has
ever
said--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if
i
may
finish
simply
the
answer
to
this.
i
don't
think
anyone
has
ever
said
that
one
polish
american
necessarily
does
like
another
polish
american.
it's
not
the
stereotype,
which
is
what
we're
complaining
of,
the
stereotype
that
one
black
thinks
exactly
like
another
and
should
be
represented
by
another.
