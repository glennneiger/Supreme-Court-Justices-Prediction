justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
your
argument
really
isn't...
does
not
rest,
i
take
it,
at
any
point
on
the
fact
that
any
of
these
other
principles
have
been
mandated
either
by
the
authority
of
this
court
or
by
any
other
authority
that
we
would
have
to
recognize.
your
case
really
rests
simply
on
the
motivation
by
which
this
particular
configuration
supposedly
was
justified.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
none
of
them
has
independent
constitutional
significance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
everett,
do
i
understand
your
argument
here
to
be
that
the
problem
is
not
race
consciousness
as
such
in
drawing
lines,
it's
the
specificity
of
the
race
consciousness
in
saying,
in
effect,
that
there
must
be
a
quota
of
two
districts?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
then
do...
how
do
you
draw
the
line
on
your
theory
between
what
is
a
permissible
use
of
race
consciousness
in
this
kind
of
districting
or
redistricting
and
what
is
impermissible?
how
is
the...
what
is
the
principle
on
which
that
line
is
drawn?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
a
case
like
this
in
which
you're
not
so
much
breaking
apart
a
district
in
which
a
violation
has
occurred,
you've
simply
got
to
come
up
with
another
district
and,
as
a
consequence,
essentially
a
whole
new
configuration?
how
do
you...
would
one
way
to
do
it,
on
your
theory,
simply
be
to
avoid
a
gingles
violation?
would
that
sort
of
be
your...
or
a
violation
of
the
gingles
principles.
would
that
be
your
objective
to
determine
what
is
permissible
and
what
isn't?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
attorney
general
had
suggested
in
this
case
not
that
there
should
be
a
second
district,
minority-majority
district,
but
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
have
two,
and
he
would
like
to
know
why
two
had
not
been
proposed?
given
the
fact
that
you
accept
that
some
race
consciousness
is
permissible,
would
that
have
been
impermissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
the
trouble
i'm
having
is
you
accept
the
principle
that
there
can
be
some
race
consciousness,
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
are
willing
to
let
that
principle
be
applied
in
a
concrete
way
at
every
point
at
which
we
or
somebody
might
suggest,
well,
taking
race
into
account,
this
might
be
a
permissible
way
to
do
it
or,
a
second
step,
this
is
probably
the
only
permissible
way
to
do
it.
at
that
point
you
draw
the
line.
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
take
race
into
account
and
draw
the
line
as
neatly
as
you're
drawing
it.
that's
where
i'm
having
my
trouble.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
again
we're
getting
back
to,
it
seems
to
me,
to
criteria
which
you
conceded
a
while
ago
did
not
themselves
have
any
independent
constitutional
significance.
and
i
think
you're
now
coming
back
to
the
argument
that
race...
when
race
is
taken
into
account,
although
that
may
be
permissible
per
se,
it
cannot
be
taken
into
account,
in
effect,
without
serving
a
series
of
other
principles
like
compactness,
community
identification,
and
so
on.
and
yet,
you've
conceded
that
these
don't
have
independent
constitutional
significance.
so,
how
do
we
derive
your
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
everett,
just
one
last
point
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
principle.
you're
not
resting
on
the
principle
of
the
color-blind
constitution,
are
you?
i
mean,
you
accept,
for
example,
the
gingles
analysis,
and
whatever
that
is,
it
isn't
color-blind.
i
mean,
you
accept
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
want
us
to...
do
we
overrule...
do
we
say
that
the
possibility
applying
a
gingles
analysis
cannot
be
anticipated
in
redistricting?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
but
is
it
fair
to
say
that
you
accept
the
principle
that
redistricting
can
be
done
on
the
basis
of
trying
to
anticipate
the
possibility
of
a
gingles
violation
and
to
avoid
it
by
drawing
lines
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
voter
dilution?
you
accept
that
principle,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
that's
not
a
principle
of
a
color-blind
constitution,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
you
go
ahead.
i
had
just
assumed
that
as
long
as
any
one
covered
county
was
going
to
be
affected
by
the
plan,
that
that
would
be
enough
to
trigger
the
right
to
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
explanation
different
from
that?
