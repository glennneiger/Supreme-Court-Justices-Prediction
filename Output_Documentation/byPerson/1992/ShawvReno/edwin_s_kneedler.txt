mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
was
permitted
to
take
race
into
account
in
order
to
ensure
that
its
redistricting
plan
complied
with
the
voting
rights
act.
several
features
of
the
voting
rights
act
will
effectively
require
a
state
to
do
so
in
certain
circumstances.
for
example,
the
effects
test
under
section
5,
which
this
court
sustained
in
the
city
of
rome,
requires
a
state
to
ensure
that
a
districting
plan
not
have
a
retrogressive
effect
on
minorities,
which
will
require
a
state,
in
order
to
ensure
that
its
plan
will
comply,
to
look
at
the
racial
composition
of
the
district.
the
same
is
true
under
the
results
test
in
gingles
in
which
a
court,
in
order
to...
in
which
a
state,
in
order
to
guard
against
or
to
create
assurance
against
vote
dilution,
will
have
to
evaluate
the
racial
composition
of
its
districts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
jewish
organizations,
the
court
faced
essentially
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
the
facts
were
slightly
different,
but
the
essential
thrust
of
that
decision
we
think
controls
here,
and
that
is
that
where
a
state
is
acting
in
an
effort
to
comply,
in
a
good
faith
effort
to
comply,
with
the
voting
rights
act,
that
in
doing
so,
the
state
does
not,
at
the
same
time,
violate
the
very
amendments
that
the
voting
rights
act
is
designed
to
enforce
and
constitutionally
designed
to
enforce
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
treated
the
challenge--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
was.
well,
not
in
so
many
words,
but
the...
justice
white's
opinion
for
various
justices
treated
the
challenge
to
the
state's
efforts
to
comply
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
as
a
challenge
to
the
voting
rights
act
itself
because
if
the
state's
efforts
to
comply
were
unconstitutional
and
those
efforts
were
required
by
statute,
then
the
act
of
congress
was
necessarily
unconstitutional.
now,
in
this
case,
the
basis
for--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's
true,
although
there
were
two
concurring
justices
who
would
have
taken--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--taking
an
even
broader
position
that
any
efforts
to
comply
with
the
voting
rights
act,
even
if
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
was
not
authorized,
would
negate
invidious
intent.
in
this
case
to
the
extent--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
not,
but
as
this
court
has
said--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
although
the
voting
rights
act
is
premised
on
the
unfortunate
fact
that
racial
block
voting
occurs.
and
where
racial
block
voting
occurs,
the
result
can
be,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
dilution
of
minority
votes
and,
to
that
extent,
the
abridgement
of
the
right
to
vote
that
was
supposed
to
be
secured
by
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we
did,
indeed,
fight
a
civil
war
over
these
issues,
but
100
years
after
the
civil
war,
congress
determined
in
1965
that
the
business
of
the
civil
war
was
not
done
and
that
various
efforts
were
used,
either
intentionally
or
not,
to
discourage
blacks
from
registering
and
then
to
dilute
their
vote.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
as
to
the
latter,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
it's
the
premise.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
the
premise
of
appellants'
challenge
in
this
case
because
their
claim
of
injury
as
white
voters
must
be
premised
on
the
fact
that
voters
will
vote...
that
there
will
be
racially
polarized
voting,
or
otherwise
the
injury
of
which
they
complain
wouldn't
occur.
beyond
that,
this
court's
decision
in
gingles
affirmed
district
court
findings
of
what
were
referred
to
there
as
severe
racial
block
voting.
so,
in
north
carolina,
that
was
indeed
the
case,
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general
indicated
that
there
was
still
a
substantial
basis
for
that
concern.
now,
as
to
the...
i'm
sorry.
the
first
part
of
your
question
i
think
went
to
the...
whether
that
was
the
purpose
or
to
encourage
it.
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
that
it
was
the...
was
intended
to
encourage.
but
where
a
government,
be
it
federal
or
state--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
but
if
it
doesn't
succeed,
then
the
harm
that
appellants
are
most
concerned
about
is
really
not
present.
but
the
voting
rights
act
specifically
addresses
the
problem
not
of
individual
discrimination
against...
not
only
of
individual
discrimination
against
individual
blacks,
but
the
fear
that
a
state
either
intentionally
or
through
setting
up
districts
that
in
concert
with
private
behavior
will
have
the
effect
of
diluting
the
black
vote.
and
where
you
have
racially
polarized
voting
and
a
minority
is
submerged
in
a
majority
white
district,
that
will
be
the
effect.
and
congress
determined
that
full
effectuation
of
the
voting
rights
protected
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
required
that
that
be
addressed
as
well,
and
this
court
in
gingles
and
in
beer
and
other
cases
has
sustained...
has
applied
the
voting
rights
act
on
that
premise.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
principle
of
the
color-blind
constitution
requires
a
state
to
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
its
citizens
regrettably
may
vote
along
racial
lines
and
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
its
own
redistricting
plans--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
have
not
taken
a
position.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
would
be
much
to
be
said
for
the
state's
ability
to
do
that
if
there
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
think
there
would
have
to
be...
for
a
state
to
do
it
without
the
voting
rights
act,
there
would
have
to
be
a
basis
in
racial
block
voting
for
that
because
the
state
would
have
to
be
addressing...
and
this
was
the
premise
of
a
portion
of
the
opinion
in
u.j.o.
there
would
have
to
be
a
premise
of
some
discriminatory
conduct
going
on
that
the
state
would
address.
so,
to
that
extent,
it
would
be
something
of
the
same
motivation
that
congress
had
for
enacting
the
voting
rights
act.
i
wanted
to
address
one
point
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
would
be
permissible
constitutionally
if
the
state
were
addressing
racial
block
voting,
which
it
would
be,
in
that
respect,
addressing
private
discriminatory
conduct.
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
did
not
require
two
districts.
what
the
attorney
general
said
is
that
the
state
had
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
proving
the
absence
of
discriminatory
purpose
because
the
state's
proffered
reasons
for
rejecting
a
second
majority-minority
district
appeared
to
be
pretextual.
this
court
has
upheld
in
katzenbach
v.
south
carolina,
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
state
to
demonstrate
that
its
plans
are
free
of
racially
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
states
should
be
encouraged...
far
from
being
a
suspect,
states
should
be
encouraged
to
conduct
their
districting
in
a
way
that
comes
into
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act,
section
2
and
section
5,
although
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general's
objection
letter
furnished
the
state
with
a
pretty
firm
basis
for
doubt
as
to
whether
it
could
carry
its
burden
if
it
chose,
for
example,
the
alternative
to
go
to
court.
the
state
could
legitimately
believe
it
would
have
trouble
carrying
its
burden
of
proving
an
absence
of
discriminatory
purpose.
so,
clearly
the
basis
for
the
attorney
general's
objection
or
the
state's
concern
in
this
case,
a
fear
that
the
burden
could
not
be
carried,
was
an
authorized
interpretation
by
the
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general
is
required
to
object
where
the
state
cannot
carry
its
burden
in
that
respect.
so,
it
is
permissible
for
a
state
to
take
into
account
that
it
can't
carry
the
shifted
burden
that
this
court
sustained
in
katzenbach
v.
south
carolina,
and
therefore
to
devise
another
plan
that
will
meet
the
attorney
general's
concerns
or
the
concern
in
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
as
such
that
plans
be
free
of
racial
discrimination.
we
think
it
is
the
existence
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
this
case
and
congress'
thorough
examination
of
the
need
for
the
voting
rights
act
periodically
that
distinguishes
this
setting
from
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
required
strict
scrutiny.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
voting
rights
act
was
a
drastic
remedy
in
the
section
5
preclearance
setting,
for
example,
to
address
the
pernicious
evil
of
voting
discrimination,
and
rather
than
require
case-by-case
adjudication,
congress
determined,
and
this
court
held
validly
determined,
that
it
was
necessary
to
adopt
broader
measures
to
prevent,
to
hedge
against
purposeful
discrimination.
and
it's
on
that
basis--
