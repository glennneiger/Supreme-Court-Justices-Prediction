justice
byron
r.
white
did
he...
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say...
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
voting
rights
act
either
authorizes
exactly
what
was
done
here
or
required
what
was
done
here.
you
would
say
then
the
voting
rights
act
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
authorizes
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
much
of
north
carolina
is
the
kind
of
state
that
the
voting
rights
act
applies
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
deny
that
you
xx
to
have
preclearance
for
this
redistricting.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
and
you
say
the
attorney
general
was
wrong
in
refusing
to
preclear
your
original
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
attorney
general...
don't
we
have
to
decide
here
whether
the
attorney
general
was...
construction
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
correct
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
a
sense.
well,
it's
either
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
decide--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
to...
for
you
to
win,
we
have
to
decide
that
he
construed
the
act
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
that
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
attorney
general
suggested
that
the
state
needed
to
have
another
majority-minority
district--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
pointed
out
that
it
might...
one
might
be
created
in,
what,
the
southeast
corner?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
southeast
corner
of
the
state?
then
he
didn't...
but
anyway,
he
did...
before
you
could
get
preclearance,
he
thought
you
had
to
have
another
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
this...
this
was
a
three-judge
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
issue
brought
before
it
about
whether
or
not
that
12th
district
was
subject
to
preclearance
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
attorney
general
rested
squarely
on
the
voting
rights
act,
and
you
think
that
his
interpretation
was
proper
of
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
deny
that
later
decisions
such
as
voinovich
renders
his
interpretation
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
so,
the
attorney
general
said
that
the
voting
rights
act
required
a
second
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
he
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unless
you
do,
you've
violated
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
it
was
at
least
implicit
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
don't
you...
suppose
you
had
turned...
decided
that
you
didn't
want
a
second
district
and
the
legislature...
well,
i'll
put
it
this
way.
what
does
a
plaintiff
have
to
prove
to
show
that
the
state
has
violated
the
voting
rights
act
in
redistricting?
do
they
have
to
prove
a
discriminatory
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
you
say
earlier
in
your
remarks
that
your
defense
is
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
voting
rights
act
require
that
led
you
to
think
that
you
should
have
a
second
minority
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
talk
about
the
attorney
general.
just
talk
about
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
voting
rights
act,
therefore,
sort
of
incorporate
the
constitutional
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
constitution
forbids
a
state
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
have
proportional
representations
between
the
various
races?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
state
is
permitted
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
proper
basis
is
we
think
there
ought
to
be
proportional
representation.
what's
the
name
of
the
case
that
i
think
i
wrote
the
opinion
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
i
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
connecticut
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
held
that
it
was
all
right
to
give
proportional
representation
to
democrats
and
republicans.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
taken
two
different
positions
really.
well,
it
doesn't...
the
constitution
doesn't
require
you
to
do
it,
but
does
it
permit
you
to
do
it?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
does
it
permit
you
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
section
5
i
think...
i
thought
we
agreed
the
test
under
section
5
is
really
equivalent
to
the
constitutional
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
just
a
plurality
opinion,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
agreeing
with
what
you
just
said?
