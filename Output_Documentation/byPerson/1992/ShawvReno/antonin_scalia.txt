justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
everett,
i
mean,
you
say
community
of...
communities
of
interest
can
be
taken
into
account,
but
doesn't
that
necessarily
mean
that
racial
groups
can
be
taken
into
account
as
well?
i
mean,
if
in
fact
there's
a
community
that's
a
religious
community,
a
racial
community
or
whatever,
why
can't
that
be
taken
into
account
by
intelligent
legislators
in
districting?
i
thought
you
were
making
that
concession
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
think
what
you're
objecting
to
is
using
race
as
a
stereotype--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
assuming
that
all
black
people
will
vote
for
a
black
representative,
and
therefore
drawing
a
district
with
a
certain
number
of
blacks
in
it
on
the
assumption
that
since
they're
black,
they
will
vote
for
a
black
representative.
that's
using
race
not
for
community,
but
for
the
stereotypical
conclusion
that
if
you
are
white,
you
will
vote
for
a
white,
and
if
you're
black,
you'll
vote
for
a
black,
which
is
not
very
good
for
our
society
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
voting
rights
act
apply
to
republicans?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your...
i
guess
your
good
faith
defense.
if
the
intent
is
a
constitutionally
invalid
intent,
can
it
be
possible
that
simply
because
the
justice
department
told
you
you
could
do
it,
it
is
rendered
okay?
i
mean,
suppose
the
justice
department
says
it's
okay
to
discriminate
in
appointments
on
the
basis
of
race.
that
happens
to
be
wrong,
but
if
in
good
faith
you
follow
that,
that
makes
it
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
agree
that
that
defense
is
only
a
valid
defense
if
the
justice
department
was
correct
that
you
needed
a
second
majority-minority
district.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well
be,
but
is
it
your
position
that
even
if
it
was
wrong,
so
long
as
you
were
relying
upon
that,
you
are
immunized?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reliance
here
you
say
would
be
a
reasonable
reliance,
whereas
in
my
hypothetical
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
didn't
have
to
accept
his
concern.
you
don't
have
to...
i
mean,
the
civil
rights
division
of
the
justice
department
isn't
the
last
word
on
this
thing,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have
gone
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
say
this
is
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
chose
not
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i
don't
think
you
should
rely
on
the
justice
department.
you
chose
to
do
it.
you
took
the
easy
way
out
i
suppose
you
could
say,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
gives
you
a
good
faith
defense.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said
no,
and
you
were
entitled
to
go
somewhere
else.
you
chose
not
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
asserting
that
the...
that
a
state
can
do
that
for
race
too
and
could
say,
you
know,
we
have
60
percent
one-race,
30
percent
another,
10
percent
another.
we're
going
to
draw
our
districts
to
make
sure
that
everybody
gets
his
proper
proportion
of
the
action.
that
is
constitutional
you
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it
doesn't,
but
you
seem
to
be
taking
that
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that
deal
with
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
pardon?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
deal
with
race
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
our
cases
have
held
that
you
could
do
this
to
remedy
a
violation
of
the
act.
you
haven't
established
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act
which
could
only
be
remedied
by
this.
all
you've
established
is
that
the
state,
rather
than
going
to
the
d.c.
court,
accepted
the
attorney
general's
determination
that
the
easy
way
to
get
this
thing
done
would
be
to
draw
up
a
second
district.
i
don't
know
how
that
has
any
remote
resemblance
to
our
cases
that
say
where
you've
been
in
violation,
you
can
do
this
to
eliminate
the
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
whole
thing
wouldn't
succeed
unless
they...
unless
the
block
voting
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
your
argument,
though,
mr.
kneedler,
you're
not
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
turned
this
plan
down.
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
state
had
done
this
on
its
own
before
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general.
