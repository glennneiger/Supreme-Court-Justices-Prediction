justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
brings
us
back
to
the
point
justice
stevens
was
beginning
to
discuss
with
you.
isn't
a
state
free
to
reject
the
idea
of
compactness
if
it
chooses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
this
were
a
state
that
were
not
covered
by
the
voting
act...
voting
rights
act,
would
a
state
legislature
be
free,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
to
draw
a
district
such
as
this
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
sticking
for
a
moment
with
the
hypothetical
of
the
state
where
the
voting
rights
act
is
inapplicable,
section
5,
the
only
justification
for
a
district
of
this
kind
then
is
that
there
was
racially
polarized
voting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
a
state
that
has
racially
polarized
voting
under
the
voting
rights
act,
as
you
are
interpreting
it,
is
required
to
employ
methods
which
will
continue
racially
polarized
voting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
that's
the
logical
conclusion
from
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
a
district
would
either
perpetuate
or
increase
the
possibilities
of
racially
polarized
voting,
then
the
district
cannot
be
drawn
consistently
with
the
constitution
based
on
race?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
in
the
end
that
that's
permissible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
the
policy,
mr.
kneedler,
of
the
justice
department
and
of
the
united
states
to
encourage
racial
block
voting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
policy
to
discourage
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
is
it
a
plausible
assumption
that
racial
block
voting
is,
a,
encouraged
and,
b
is
the
explicit
premise
for
the
design
of
this
district?
