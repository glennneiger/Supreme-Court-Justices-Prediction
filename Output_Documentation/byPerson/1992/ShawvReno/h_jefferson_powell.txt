mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
legal
significance
of
two
facts.
first,
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
intentionally
created
two
majority-minority
congressional
districts.
second,
the
general
assembly
did
so
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
of
securing
preclearance
of
its
congressional
reapportionment
plan
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
in
their
arguments
before
the
district
court
and
in
their
briefs
to
this
court,
the
plaintiffs'
legal
contention
has
been
that
the
first
of
these
allegations,
that
the
state
acted
intentionally,
is
an
adequate
basis
on
which
to
make
out
a
constitutional
claim.
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
plaintiffs'
case
is
that
they
themselves
have
affirmatively
described
what
the
state's
purpose
was
in
so
acting,
and
that
purpose
was
the
lawful
one
of
complying
with
federal
voting
rights
legislation
as
interpreted
and
administered
by
the
responsible
federal
official.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
that
question
was
not,
in
fact,
presented
to
the
district
court.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
and
that
is
that
given
the
distribution
of
the
counties,
it
was
necessary
to
preclear
the
entire
plan
and
that,
in
fact,
the
proper
focus
in
this
case
with
the
statewide
redistricting
plan
is
statewide.
when
the
state--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--as
the
attorney
general
administers
the
statute,
he
expects
the
entire
plan
to
be
submitted.
that
makes
pragmatic
sense
because
state
legislatures,
when
they
draw
up
a
statewide
congressional
reapportionment
plan,
they
do
it
on
a
statewide
basis.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
i
think
it's
administrative
authority,
your
honor.
it's
the
way
the
act
has
been
administered
and
interpreted.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
i'm
not
aware
of
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
i
think
that's--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--no.
no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
mean
it
to
be.
we
think
that
would...
you
would
have
to
submit
the
statewide
plan
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
no,
justice
scalia.
that's
emphatically
not
our
position.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
our
position--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--our
defense
is
applicable
if
our
intent
was
proper,
and
if
our
intent
would
not
be
proper
if
the
attorney
general
instructed
the
state
or
attempted
to
coerce
the
state
into
doing
something
unconstitutional.
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general's
implicit
interpretation
of
the
act
embodied
in
his
objection
letter
was
well
within
the
case
law.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
so
long
as
the
state's
reliance
is
reasonable.
the
state
could
not
rely,
and
then
invoke
as
a
defense
that
reliance,
on
patently
unconstitutional
requests
or
demands
from
the
attorney
general.
the
difference...
what
makes
this
case
different
from
the
hypothetical
you're
thinking
about--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
we
do
indeed.
of
course,
voinovich
was
a
section
2
decision,
and
voinovich
made
two
holdings
of
tangential
relevance
to
this
case.
voinovich
applied
the
traditional
invidious
intent
requirement
and
overturned
a
finding
of
invidious
intent,
and
the
voinovich
case
held
that
the
voting...
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
neither
compels
nor
forbids
the
creation
of
majority-minority
districts.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
no,
justice
white.
that's
not
what
the
attorney
general
said.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
the
attorney
general
objected
to
the
state's
first
plan--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--saying
that
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
state
has
carried
its
burden
of
persuading
me
that
the
state's
first
plan
did
not
have
some
kind
of
discriminatory
purpose.
and
the
attorney
general
in
explaining
why
he
reached
that
conclusion
that
the
state
had
failed
to
carry
its
burden
explained,
among
other
things,
that
i
believe
it
will
be
possible
to
create
a
second
majority-minority
district
and
i'm
concerned
that
that
may
be
evidence--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--that's
not
the
legal
meaning
of
the
attorney
general's
objection
letter.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
it
certainly
is.
implicit
in
the
attorney
general's
letter
is...
certainly
is
a
suggestion
that
a
second
majority-minority
district
will
go
a
long
way
towards
meeting
my
concern
because
my
concern
is
based
in
part
on
the
fact
you
didn't
create
one.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
we
certainly...
we
did--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--congress
has
created
a
statutory
scheme
under
which
it
is
up
to
the
state
to
decide
which
route
to
take
in
seeking
preclearance.
the
state
here
chose
the
attorney
general's
administrative
preclearance
route.
the
attorney
general
objected.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
and
we
submit
that
we
were
entitled,
in
fact,
to
go
back
to
the
attorney
general
and
to
attempt
to
meet
his
objections.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
under
section
5,
justice
white?
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
i'm
not
sure.
under
section
2,
you'd
go
through
the
gingles
preclearance.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
under
section
5,
i'm
not
sure
a
private
right
of
action
exists.
a
constitutional
claim
in
this
context
would
have
to
include
a
claim
of
invidious
intent
as
this
court
has
traditionally
used
that
concept.
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
lacking
in
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
have
not
alleged...
indeed,
the
district
court
below
said
they
could
not
plausibly
allege...
that
the
general
assembly
chose
this
plan
because
it
would
impose
an
adverse
impact
on
white
voters
or,
indeed,
any
other
racial
group.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
croson
line
of
decisions
is
distinct
from
this
court's
own
vote
dilution,
race-based
vote
dilution,
cases,
white
against
regester,
rogers
against
lodge,
and
so
on.
those
cases,
which
set
out
the
test
to
be
applied
in
this
context,
instruct
the
trier
of
fact
to
look
for
invidious
intent.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
they
continue
to
be
valid.
as
recently
as
1986
in
davis
against
bandemer,
the
political
gerrymandering
case,
seven
justices
of
this
court
expressly
reaffirmed
the
validity
of
the
effects
prong
and
the
invidious
intent
prong--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--our
defense
is
that
the
state's
purpose
here
was
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act,
that
what
the
state...
what
the
attorney
general--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--the
voting
rights
act--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--the
voting
rights
act
requires
the
state
to
demonstrate
an
absence
of
invidious
intent
and
an
absence
of
retrogressive
effect.
that's
a
procedural
requirement.
the
burden
lies
on
the
state.
this
court
has
approved
in
a
series
of
cases,
going
back
20
years,
the
use
of
majority-minority
districts--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--certainly.
you
violate
section
5
if
you
had
the
invidious
intent
necessary
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
we'd
have
a
very
different
case.
the
answer
would
depend
on
the
application
of
section
2.
in
appropriate
circumstances,
section
2,
in
order
to
avoid
vote
dilution
as
in
the
gingles
situation,
might
require
majority-minority
districting.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
no,
justice
stevens.
however,
something
very
close
to
that--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--there
would
not
be
an
appropriate
basis
on
which
to
make
use
of
the
racial
classification.
this
court
in
a
number
of...
well,
members
of
this
court
in
a
number
of
opinions
have
suggested
that
where
the
state
confronted
a
problem
with
racially
polarized
voting,
that
the
state
might
be
able
to
use
race
conscious
redistricting
to
address
that,
but
that's
not
this
case.
the
determining
factor
in
this
case
is
that
north
carolina
is
subject
to
section
5
preclearance.
it
met
those
affirmative
obligations
in
ways
that
have
been
recognized
repeatedly.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
section
2
might
require
a
state
to
use
majority-minority
districts,
justice
kennedy,
in
order
to
avoid
vote
dilution
of
minority
voters.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
one
hopes
not,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
only
if
the
consequences
of
drawing
majority-minority
districts
is
to
perpetuate
racially
polarized
voting.
that's
a
question
which
we
believe
congress
has
considered
and
addressed
by
amending
section
2
to
incorporate
the
results
test.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
the
state
doesn't
act
free...
xx
understand
the
question
correctly,
the
state
doesn't
act
free
of
federal
voting
rights
legislation,
and
so
that
even
if
section
5
were
not
applicable,
the
state
would...
a
conscientious
state
legislature
would
have
to
meet
the
requirements
of
section
2.
section
2
may,
depending
on
the
particular
demographics
and
the
situation
of
the
state,
require
majority-minority
districting,
but
once
again,
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
be.
in
a
case
where
plaintiffs
were
alleging
that
there
was
a
variance
between
the
state's
purported
purpose
and
its
real
purpose,
which
actually
was
the
case
in
voinovich
i
believe,
that
might
be
probative
of
the
existence
of
this
covert
intent.
there's
no
dispute
here
over
what
the
state's
purpose
is.
there's
a
dispute
over
how
to
characterize
it
legally,
but
we're
not
in
disagreement
over
what
the
state
legislature
was
trying
to
do.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
no,
your
honor.
i
may
have
misspoken
myself.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
the
state
would
have
to
have
a
proper
basis.
i'm
not
sure
that
the--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--gaffney
against
cummings.
[laughter]
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
gaffney
against
cummings.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
in
gaffney,
the
court
suggested
in--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--you
certainly
did,
your
honor,
and
the
court
suggested
that
the
same
thing...
that
this
court
has
no
warrant
to
overturn
state
attempts
to
ensure
some
kind
of
rough
correspondence
between
numbers
of
voters
and
representation.
but
that's
not
the
primary
basis
on
which
we
rely.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
we
think
nothing
in
our
position
requires
us
to
hold
beyond--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--yes.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
gaffney
against
cummings
and
other
cases
suggest
it
does.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
gaffney
dealt
with
race
in
dicta.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
gaffney
dealt
with
race
in
dicta.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
the
holding
was
not
about
race.
it
was
politics.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
consistently
with
this
court's
cases
interpreting
it,
yes,
your
honor.
that's
not
this
case.
the
state's
purpose
here...
the
state
did
not
have
an
independent
policy
of
racial
proportionality.
the
state's
policy
here
was
to
meet
the
one
person/one
vote
requirement,
to
satisfy
the
exigent
requirements
of
the
federal
voting
rights
act,
and
otherwise
to
satisfy
other
state
concerns.
the
state
here
was
not
pursuing
an
independent
policy
of
racial
balancing
or
anything
of
the
sort.
and
we
think
in
the
end,
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
for
20
years,
this
court--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--what
the
state
did
here,
yes,
your
honor.
for
20
years,
this
court
has
approved
majority-minority
districting
as
an
appropriate
response
to
a
state's
obligations
under
section
5.
we
believe
the
cases
that--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--it
would
be...
it
would
not...
the
plaintiffs
would
not
have
stated
a
claim.
they
do
not
allege
that
the
state
acted
in
order
to
harm
a
racial
group.
this
state...
this
court's--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
may
have
misspoken.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
is
one
in
which
the
plaintiffs
would
have
failed
to
state
a
claim
and
the
state's
action
would
be
constitutional.
the...
this
case
in
the
end
is
about
the
state's
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act.
the
case
is...
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
state
invokes
a
defense
or
an
immunity
to
protect
itself.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
we
don't
read
the
cases
to
hold
that.
we
think
that
in
a
variety
of
cases,
including
city
of
port
arthur,
this
court
has
insisted
on
or
permitted
states
to
use
or
make
changes
in
their
electoral
laws,
including
majority-minority
districting,
in
order
to
carry
their
burden
of
demonstrating
compliance
with
section
5.
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
well,
there
are
two
tests.
there's
the
intent
test--
mr.
h.
jefferson
powell
--which
is
constitutional.
section
5
also
forbids
retrogressive
effect.
in
the
end
this
case
is
about
the
voting
rights
act.
at
least
up
to
this
point,
the
plaintiffs'
argument
has
been
a
pure
argument
that
race
consciousness
is
invidious
and
unconstitutional.
section
5
and
section
2,
as
amended,
both
authorize
and
in
appropriate
circumstances
require
race
consciousness
in
governmental
decision
making.
unless
those
provisions
of
the
statute
are
unconstitutional,
the
plaintiffs'
claim
is
incorrect.
we
believe
this
court's
decisions
upholding
the
act...
the
act's
constitutionality
are
correct,
and
that
the
district
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
