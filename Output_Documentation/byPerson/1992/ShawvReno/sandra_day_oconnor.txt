--well,
mr.
everett,
i
guess
this
court
summarily
affirmed
in
a
previous
case
that
came
before
us
raising
just
these
points.
justice

mr.
powell,
can...
this
district
12
is
a
highly
irregular
shape.
i
guess
you
agree
with
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
places
only
as
wide
as
a
highway
and
stretching
virtually
the
length
of
the
state.
do
you
think
that
a
district
such
as
that
could
be
in
and
of
itself
some
evidence
of
an
invidious
intent?
