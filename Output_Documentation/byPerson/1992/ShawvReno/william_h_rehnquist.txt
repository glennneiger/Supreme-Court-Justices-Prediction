we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-357,
ruth
o.
shaw
v.
janet
reno.
mr.
everett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
united
states
attorney
general?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
only
five
counties
in
which
there's
a
majority
of
white
persons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
black
persons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
your
basic
point,
mr.
everett,
that
that
sort
of
intent
or
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
everett,
what's
the
effect
of
the
voting
rights
act
by
its
terms
where
40
out
of
100
counties
are
covered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
were
to
draw
a
district
that
was
entirely
in
areas
that
were
not
subject
to
preclearance.
would
the
voting
rights
act
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
all
of
the
counties
which
are
the
subject
of
this
district
which
you're
complaining
about...
are
they
all
subject
to
preclearance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
many
of
the
counties
in
this
district
are
not
subject
to
preclearance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
everett--
--mr.
everett,
i
thought
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
was
that
race
could
be
taken
into
consideration
if
race
had
previously
been
taken
into
consideration
in
an
adverse
way--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
you
could
right
that
wrong.
but
i
wonder
if
you're
wise
in
conceding
that
race
should
be
taken
into...
could
be
taken
into
consideration
in
any
further
extent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
also
said
in
some
of
our
reapportionment
cases,
haven't
we,
that
legislative
lines
drawn
on
the
basis
of
party
interests
are
not...
don't
violate
any
constitutional--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
everett.
mr.
powell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
position,
mr.
powell,
on
the
application
of
the
voting
rights
act
when
only
40
out
of
100
counties
are
subject
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
position
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
way
should
that
be
when
only
40
counties
are
subject
to
preclearance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what's
the
authority
for
that
in
the
voting
rights
act
if
only
40
counties
are
covered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
isn't
any
authority
in
the
act
itself
for
that?
it's
just
an
administrative
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
some
of
our
cases
have
simply
said
that
an
intent
to
classify
on
the
basis
of
race...
the
croson
case,
for
example...
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
not
that
it's
automatically
out,
but
that
it's
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
were
decided
before
croson,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
answered
justice
kennedy's
question
to
the
same
effect
exactly
the
opposite.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
which...
on
which
case
did
you
misspeak?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
powell.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--cases
involved
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
itself,
did
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
u.j.o.
didn't...
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
there,
was
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
there
or
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
everett,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
everett.
the
case
is
submitted.
