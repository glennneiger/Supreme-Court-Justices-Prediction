mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
we
take
in
this
case
is
parallel
to
the
position
taken
by
petitioner
in
several
respects.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
actually
quite
narrow.
number
1,
we
do
agree
that...
with
what
i
understand
the
petitioner's
submission
to
be,
that
the
offer
to
stipulate
is
a
factor
which
a
court
may
and
should
take
into
account
in
the
course
of
the
403...
rule
403
balancing
that
has
to
be
done
during
the
course
of
a
decision
to
decide
whether
to
admit
extrinsic
act
evidence
under
rule
404(b).
as
we
say
it...
as
we
see
it,
and
if
i
may
back
up
for
just
a
moment,
we
think
there
is
essentially
a
three
step
process
here.
this
case
focuses
on
the
third
of
those
three
steps.
the
first
step
is,
is
this
evidence
relevant?
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
evidence
is
relevant,
and
i
don't
understand
petitioner
to
be
arguing
to
the
contrary.
this
is
a
case
in
which
petitioner,
his
whole
defense
was
that
this
entire
case
was
essentially
the
product
of
an
overly
aggressive
fbi
investigation,
and
in
which
essentially
the
children
were
led
into
and
deceived
into
and
pressured
into
making
false
accusations
against
mr.
hadley.
the
evidence
that
we--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--certainly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
the
judge
i
think
gave...
the
answer
is,
i
think
it
is
consistent,
although
the
instruction
i
think
was
unduly
narrow.
it
was
consistent
in
this
sense,
in
that
the...
several
of
the
contacts
were
contacts
in
which
the
defendant
admitted
that
there
was
a
contact
but
contended
that
there
was
actually
no
crime
because
the
contact
was
not
accompanied
by
a
desire
for
sexual
gratification.
in
other
words,
he
was
saying,
i...
basically,
he's
making
a
defense
of
no
intent,
even
though
he's
attacking
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
first
of
all
that
there
is...
i
don't
think
it's
really
inconsistent
with
the
judge's
notion
that...
the
judge
i
think
had
a
very
broad
notion
of
what
preparation
and
plan
was,
and
he
understood
that
to
mean
that
evidence
going
to
whether
there
was
a
sequence
of
events
leading
to
a
particular--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
so
that...
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
this
evidence
didn't
in
some
respect
bear
on
that
question,
even
though
they
would
have,
under
the
instruction,
already
had
to
have
decided
that
they
were
satisfied
that
there
was
physical
contact.
the...
what
i
think...
and
where
i
think
i
can
perhaps
explain
what
i
think
the
judge
had
in
mind
by
the
combination
of
the
basis
for
admission
and
the
instruction
was
that
the
judge
was
focusing
on
the
fact
that
these
witnesses
corroborated
one
another.
the
two
witnesses
in
question,
amadee
r.
and
cory
k.,
gave
testimony
which
was
so
similar
that
doubts
that
one
may
have
had
about
the
accuracy
of
amadee
r.'s
whole
explanation
of
the
events
were
much
relieved
when
you
heard
cory
k.
testify
to
a
very,
very
similar
sequence
of
events.
now,
that
goes
to
the
credibility
of
amadee
r.,
who
was
attacked
by
petitioner
on
cross-examination
as
having
fabricated
this
story.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
except--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--except
that
there
are
two
questions
that
amadee
r.'s
testimony
bears
on:
1)
the
question
of
whether
the
event
occurred,
but
2)
and
significantly
for
purposes
of
the
instruction,
the
question
of
whether
his
testimony
reflects
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
so
if
you
believe
that
that
event
occurred
as
amadee
r.
described
it,
then
you
conclude
that
there
must
have
been
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
or
at
least
you
conclude
that
there's
a
very...
a
much
more
powerful
case
to
be
made
for
intent.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
and
that's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
corroboration.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
corroboration.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
okay,
fine.
we're
prepared
to
litigate
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
certainly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
certainly
true.
i
think
this
instruction
was
unduly
restrictive.
the
fact
that
the
instruction
may
have
been
too
narrow
doesn't
retroactively
render
the
evidence
inadmissible.
the
evidence
was
admissible
as
relevant
on
the
basis
that
it
went
among
other
things
to
the
question
of
whether
the
acts
occurred.
the
fact
that
there
was
a
subsequent
instruction
that
was
restrictive
may
have
been
unfortunate.
it
may
have
unduly
restricted
what
the
jury
could
do
with
that
evidence,
but
it
didn't
affect
the
question
of
relevance.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
i
think
so.
now,
let
me--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
we're
using
the
prior
bad
acts
to
show
that
the
testimony
given
by
amadee
r.
was
in
fact
credible
and
to
show
that
that
event
occurred
without
going
through
the
intermediate
inference
of
character.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
we
don't
need
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
he
did
it
once,
he
probably
did
it
twice.
we're
saying
when
witnesses
testify
as
in
this
case
to
very
similar
events,
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
just
how
similar
these
two
accounts
are,
then
the
doctrine
of
chances
that
wigmore
articulated
comes
very
much
into
play.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
this
evidence
is
relevant
to...
under
the
doctrine
of
chances
to
the
conclusion
that
the...
that
either
the
event
occurred
or
that
the
defendant
had
intent,
then
it
would
be
admissible
under
the
rule,
or
at
least
it
wouldn't
be
foreclosed--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the...
we
certainly
concede
that
where
you
don't
have
similarity
and
where
the
doctrine
of
chances
would
not
have
a
powerful
impact
as
it
would
in
this
case,
that
you
could--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
you
could
have
a
relevant
propensity
of
the
sort
that
if
a
person
has
committed
one
criminal
act,
he's
more
likely
to
commit
another
like
criminal
act,
but
that
is
what
the
rule
is
addressed
to.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
stipulation
issue
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
certainly,
yes,
and
let
me
proceed--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
should
be,
and
it
was
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
said
on
several
occasions
that
this
particular
stipulation
on
this
record
simply
doesn't
give
the
government
the
equivalent
of
that
evidence,
that
404(b)
evidence.
the
judge
was
very
careful
in
his
403
balancing
in
this
case,
and
he
looked
time
and
again
at
the
stipulation,
even
suggested
an
alternative
form
of
the
stipulation
that
counsel
could
propose
that
might
well
displace
the
need
for
the
404(b)
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
and
then
the
second
step
is
is,
is
there
anything
about
the
relevant
evidence
that...
is
there
anything
in
rule
404(b)
that
forces
the
court
to
exclude
that
relevant
evidence,
and
there
is
not
in
this
case,
and
then
you
get
to
the
40...
excuse
me,
the
403
question,
which
is
the
balancing
test
under
the
rule
that
provides
that
if
the
evidence
is
more
prejudicial
than
probative
then--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
the
government--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
your
honor,
the
judge
considered
the
offer
in
this
following
sense.
the
judge
looked
at
the
offer
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
are
several
places
that...
if
you
have
the
joint
appendix,
at
joint
appendix
35,
and
at
joint
appendix...
well,
it's
at
transcript
878.
that...
this...
one
portion
of
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
other
is.
the
court
explains
the...
it's
describing
this
whole
purpose
of
admitting
the
404(b)
evidence
and
says
that
simply
to
have
a
sterile
stipulation
that
mr.
hadley
did
these
things
and
that
was
his
intention
takes
away
from
the
jury
the
opportunity
to
judge
that
intention
and
act
on
it,
and
adds
that...
the
court
then
adds
that
this
evidence
goes
to
motive
intent
as
well
as
to
whether
there
were
any
particular
plans
or
preparations
having
to
do
with
his
conduct
of
these
kinds
of
activities.
this
is
the
plan
and
preparation
motion
that
the
court--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
court's
concept
was
that
if
you
look
at
the
similarity
in
the
cory
k.
testimony
and
the
amadee
r.
testimony
it
establishes
a
modus
operandi,
essentially,
is
what
he
was
talking
about
with
plan
and
preparation,
which
reflects
on
both
intent
and
the
commission
of
the
act.
he
uses
modus
operandi
from
time
to
time,
but
usually
he
talks
about
plan
and
preparation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
the
prior
bad
acts
are
very
probative
of
modus
operandi
which
in
turn
reflects
one
of
the
ultimate
elements
of
the
crime,
yes,
your
honor,
certainly,
and
that
bears...
that
turns
on
whether
there's
great
similarity
in
the
prior
bad
acts.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
let
me
turn
to
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
here
are
the
reasons,
and
let
me
just
go
down
the
reasons
that
i
think
the
stipulation
was
inadequate.
first
of
all
there...
the
attack,
as
i've
mentioned,
on
the
witnesses
was
the
suggestion
that
they
had
simply
fabricated
this
evidence.
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
corroborate
those
witnesses
in
some
way
in
order
for
the
jury
to
believe
the
witnesses.
whether
the
jury
believed
the
witnesses
or
not
obviously
went
to
the
issues
not
only
of
intent
but
also
whether
the
crime
was
committed.
it
certainly
went
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
it
certainly
did
not
exclude
corroboration,
and
the
judge
said
explicitly--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
spoke
only
of
ultimate
issues,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it
didn't
say
explicitly
you
may
use
this
for
corroboration,
but
in
saying
that
you
may
use
this
for
intent
of
preparation
or
plan,
what
the
judge
clearly
contemplated
was
that
the
jury
could
use
this
to
corroborate
witnesses
whose
testimony
in
turn
would
bear
on
intent.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
explain
why
i
think
intent
was
in
this
case
despite
the
offer
to
stipulate,
and
this
is...
really
goes
to
the
second
ground,
i
think,
on
which
the
district
court
properly
refused
to
take
the
stipulation,
and
that
is,
this
is
really
not
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
concession
as
to
intent,
but
the
theory
of
the
defense
case,
again,
was
that
i...
and
this
was
his
testimony:
i
had...
sure,
i
had
a
lot
of
contact
with
these
children.
i
dealt
with
them
on
a
regular
basis,
but
it
was
because
of
a
benevolent
interest
in
their
welfare.
he
was
saying,
i
have
not
gotten...
he
said
this
explicitly.
i
have
no
intent
of
sexual
gratification
when
i
deal
with
these
children.
i
am
attempting
simply
to
help
them
along.
i
am...
as
he
put
it
with
respect
to
amadee
r.,
i
am
a
clan
brother
of
his,
and
that's
why
i'm
having
contact
with
him,
that's
why
i'm
having
him
sit
on
my
lap--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right,
and
that
was...
what
he
was
doing
is
saying,
the
reason
those
acts
didn't
happen
is
because
i
don't
have
the
intent
to
have
sexual
gratification,
and
then
he
says,
but...
and
here's
the
stipulation...
if
they
occurred,
then
i
had
the
intent.
he
can't
concede...
he
can't
come
in
and
say
well,
you
can't
introduce
the
facts
that
will
undercut
my
intent
argument
at
the
front
side
if
i
concede
and
stipulate
intent
at
the
back
side.
it's
a
two-step
process--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
this...
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
this
objectively,
that
is
what
his
defense
was.
his
defense
was
that
i
do
not
have
the
intent
to
commit
these
crimes
and
therefore
probably
didn't
commit
them.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they...
the
court
could
have
given
such
an
instruction,
yes.
under
the
stipulation,
that
presumably
would
have
been
an
instruction.
if...
of
course,
they
would
have
had
to
conclude
first
that
the
acts
occurred,
which
would
have
depended
on
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
intent.
now,
of
course--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
there
wasn't.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct,
there
was
no
stipulation.
the
stipulation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
i'm
saying
if
the
government
had
been
required
to
stipulate--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
exactly.
that's
what
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no
error--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no
error
against
the
defendant--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
that's
right.
i
think
a
final
ground
on
which
the
404(b)
evidence...
i
keep
calling
it
404(b)
evidence.
it
really
isn't.
extrinsic
act
evidence,
let
me
call
it...
would
have
been
admissible
is
to
impeach,
and
the
denials
of
the
defendant
in
his
own
testimony
as
opposed
to
the
contradiction
of
the
theory
of
the
defense
case,
but
specifically
to
impeach
the
denials
in
his
testimony
of
having
had
sexual
contact
with
particular
minors
and
minors
in
general.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
if
it's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
it's
by
contradiction
on
a
fact
that
goes
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
it's
certainly
perfectly
permissible
to
impeach
by
contradiction,
and
you
can
do
that
by
introducing
evidence.
that
evidence
has
in
effect...
it's
admissible
evidence
which
has
become
relevant
by
virtue
of
the
denials
that
are
made,
in
this
case
denials
of
contacts
with
minors.
if...
in
other
words,
his
testimony
that
he
did
not
have
sexual
contacts
with
minors
made
relevant
evidence
that
in
fact
he
did,
because
if
he
is
telling
the
truth
that
he
didn't
have
contact...
sexual
contact
with
minors,
then
he
is
surely
not
guilty,
and
our
impeachment
by
contradiction
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case,
so
we--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--under
608,
that's
right,
because
those--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--those
go
only
to
credibility.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
there's...
if
it's
an
issue
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
case,
your
honor,
that
goes
to
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
or
whether
the
crimes
occurred
at
all,
then
we
are
certainly
entitled
to
impeach
by
contradiction.
if
the
defense
comes
in--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
there's
a
discussion
in
weinstein
of
impeachment
by
contradiction,
and
it's
at...
well,
i
don't
recall
the
section
number,
but
there
is
a
good
discussion
on
that
doctrine.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
exactly,
and
it's
become
particularly
relevant
by
virtue
of
the
denial.
in
other
words,
the
district
judge
is
perfectly
within
his
rights
to
say
that
now
you
have
specifically
denied,
given
a
broad
denial...
and
this
is
what
the
district
judge
said...
of
any
commission
of
any
of
these
crimes,
the
government
is
entitled
to
come
back
and
say
well,
that's
not
true,
because
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it's
for...
credibility,
it
goes
to
credibility
on
matters
that
aren't
part
of
the
corpus
on
the
government's
case.
in
other
words,
part
of
elements
the
government
has
to
prove
in
order
to
establish
its
case.
the
defendant
contends
that
we
smuggled
into
the
defense
testimony
the
broad
denial
of
having...
as
having
ever
had
sexual
contact
with
minors
by
asking
that
question
during
cross-examination,
but
there
can
be
no
question...
and
this,
the
district
judge
ruled
on
this...
that
given
the
nature
of
his
denials,
the
nature
of
his
defense,
including
a
statement
that
the
fbi
had
said
that
his
students
had
given
him
a
clean
bill
of
health,
all
the
suggestions
in
the
testimony
were
that
he
was
denying
any
involvement
in
any
of
these
events,
and
denying
that
he
had
ever
had
involvement
with
minor
children.
it
was
perfectly
legitimate
and
it
was,
in
terms
of
the
standard,
reasonably
suggested
by
the
direct
testimony
that
we
ask,
well,
are
you
denying
that
you've
ever
had
sexual
contact
with
minors,
and
he
did
deny
that,
so
impeachment
was
we
think
a
perfectly
legitimate
ground
for
admitting
the
evidence.
i
would
also
point
out,
in
addition
to
the
district
judge...
i
think,
by
the
way,
i
stopped
in
reading
the
quote
from
the
district
judge
before
i
got
really
to
the
main
point,
and
that
was
that
what
the
judge
was
saying
in
saying
that
the
stipulation
was
not
adequate
here,
was
that
it
didn't...
as
he
put
it,
was
not
reasonable
and
appropriate,
and
then
he
added,
under
all
the
relevant
circumstances
of
this
case.
it's
clear
that
the
district
judge
was
not
laying
down
an
absolute
rule
that
he
would
not
require
the
government
to
accept
a
stipulation
and
offer
to
stipulate
in
any
case.
the
judge
was
simply
saying
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the...
there
was
no
requirement
to...
for
the
government
to
accept
the
stipulation,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
even
discuss
this
issue.
there's
no
per
se
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
this.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
question
of
whether
something
is
not
disputed,
and
that's
quite
a
different
matter
if
an
issue
is
not
disputed
whether
the
government
could
introduce
evidence
going
to
intent,
but
because
this
issue
was
really
put
before
the
court
of
appeals
only
in
a
very
tangential
way
in
the
defendant's
court
of
appeals
briefs...
two
sentences,
i
think,
on
page
37
and
38
of
the
defendant's
briefs...
it's
not
surprising
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
this
question.
so
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
adopted
a
sweeping,
per
se
rule
of
rejection
of
any
proposed
offer
to
stipulate.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i...
your
honor,
i
think
the
district
court
was
manifestly
correct
in
concluding
that
it
was...
that
the
government
was
not
required
on
these
facts
to
accept
the
stipulation,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court,
so
you
have
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
that's
based
on
no
error,
and
you
have
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
based
on...
that's
correct
as
well.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
reverse
every
time
a
court
of
appeals
doesn't
specifically
discuss
a
particular
issue.
you
would
have
an
awful
lot
of
reversals
in
cases
in
which
the
court
says
there's
no
error,
no
merit
to
any
of
the
other
claims.
so
you
don't
have
to
reverse
in
order
to
get
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
something
explicit
on
a
matter
on
which
we
think
there's
no
error
whatsoever.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
without
more--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
would
depend,
your
honor,
on,
for
example,
whether
the
prior
bank
robbery
was
sufficiently
similar
to
support
an
inference--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
on
that
basis,
that's
not
similar
enough.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
banks
in
small
towns
in
michigan
in
which
the
robber
used
a
pearl-handled
revolver
and
used
a
particular
expression
with
the
teller,
and
the
question
is,
say,
identity,
then--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
our
position
on
rule
404(b),
your
honor,
is
that
if
it's
relevant
to
one
of
these
purposes,
other
than
simply
showing
character
for
purposes
of
establishing--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
you
have
an
identity
question,
that
would
certainly
be
so.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
depends
on
what
the
act
is,
your
honor.
if
the
act
is
very,
very
specific...
i
mean,
for
example,
suppose
you're
offering
it
to
prove
that
the
defendant
intended
to
rob
a
bank
and
what
you
have
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
let
me
give
you
this
example,
which
would
make...
in
the
bank
robbery
setting,
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
answer
that
question,
but
let
me--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
all
right,
let
me
try
this
example.
it
seems
to
me
to
make
the
point.
suppose
that
someone
is
charged
with
sexual
abuse
for
rubbing
up
against
a
woman
on
a
crowded
subway
car.
the
woman
reports
it
and
says,
this
is
what
this
person
did.
you
go
to
trial
and,
sure
enough,
three
other
women
come
in
and
say
in
exactly
the
same
way,
this
person
rubbed
up
against
me
the
week
before,
and
the
defendant
says,
look,
i
never
rubbed
up
against
this
woman,
the
complainant
in
the
case,
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
trial
judge
admits
that
evidence
to
establish--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
we'll
put
her
on
the
stand,
that's
right--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
if
they
attack
her
credibility
and
they
say--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
you
just
completely...
you
either
fabricated
this
or
you
didn't
understand--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--this
was
accidental,
this
was
just
a
brushing
up
against
you
that
had
no
purpose
to
it,
that
might
work.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
intent,
or
even
the
occurrence
of
the
event,
because
if
in
fact
she
gets
up
and
she
says
well,
this
person
brushed
up
against
me,
and
he
says,
look,
i
was
there,
i
was
nearby,
but
i
didn't
brush
up
against
her,
that
tends
to
impeach
him
that
exactly
the
same
thing
occurred
on
other
occasions,
and
it
tends
to
corroborate
her
testimony.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
count
ix
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--in
the
trailer.
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
vii
and
viii--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
vii
and
viii
were
cases
in
which
i
think
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
there
was
no
concession
as
to
intent,
because,
keep
in
mind,
he
admitted
that
he
had
allowed
amadee
r.
to
sit
on
his
lap.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
were
actually,
your
honor.
there
was
testimony
both
that...
in
cory's
case,
there
was
anal
sodomy
and
also
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--sitting
on
the
lap
in
the
same
posture.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
this
is
more...
this
is
more
unusual
conduct
in
that
respect.
it
is
certainly--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
certainly
bears
on
his
intent.
the
question
is,
when
he
put
cory
k....
excuse
me,
when
he
put
amadee
on
his
lap,
did
he
have
the
intent
to
do
anything
further,
and
i
think
cory
k.'s
testimony
reflects
very
significantly
on
that
intent
because
it
demonstrates
his
state
of
mind
in
a
generally
similar
setting.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
not
in
an
automobile.
it
was
in
his...
in
the
trailer,
that's
correct.
thank
you.
