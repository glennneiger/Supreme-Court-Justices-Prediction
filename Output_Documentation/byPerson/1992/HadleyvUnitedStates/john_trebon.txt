mr.
john
trebon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
courts
below
correctly
applied
rules
404(b)
and
403
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
order
to
assure
a
fair
trial
below.
more
specifically,
if
the
issue
of
intent
is
not
a
disputed
issue
at
trial,
and
the
defense
offers
a
genuine,
judicial
admission
on
the
issue
of
intent,
should
the
prosecution
be
allowed
to
admit
overwhelming
amounts
of
uncharged
misconduct
evidence
under
the
ruse
of
proving
the
marginal
statutory
issue
of
intent,
and
secondly,
should
the
prosecution
be
allowed
to
ambush
the
accused
with
eleventh-hour
prior
bad
conduct
evidence?
let
me
highlight
some
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
hadley
was
a
teacher
in
chilchinbeto,
arizona,
a
rural
area
on
the
navajo
indian
reservation.
he
had
never
previously
been
convicted
of
any
crimes
whatsoever.
this
was
his
first
trial.
during
a
parallel
investigation
in
chilchinbeto
involving
another
teacher,
it
came
to
the
attention
of
fbi
agents
that
mr.
hadley
may
have
a
tendency
to
be
a
homosexual.
as
a
result,
the
fbi
interviewed
all
sixth,
seventh,
and
eighth
graders
in
chilchinbeto...
over
75
students...
and
asked
them
specifically
about
mr.
hadley.
there
were
no
identified
victims,
and
mr.
hadley
was
not
known
to
be
a
suspect
before
any
of
these
interviews
commenced.
during
the
same
time,
during
the
pendency
of
this
case,
there
were
congressional
hearings
regarding
what
was
perceived
as
an
epidemic
of
child
molestation
on
the
navajo
indian
reservation.
the
victims
in
this
case,
besides
cory
k.,
who
testified
as
a
prior
bad
act
witness,
never
mentioned
that
mr.
hadley
had
touched
or
molested
them
to
anyone
else
other
than
the
fbi
either
before
or
after
the
interviews.
during
the
fbi
interviews,
many
students
at
trial
testified
that
the
fbi
told
them
that
they
knew
that
mr.
hadley
had
touched
other
students
and
they
were
only
interested
to
find
out
if
he
had
touched
them,
too.
they
were
told
that
they
couldn't
leave
the
room
unless
and
until
they
told
them
what
mr.
hadley
had
done
with
them.
they
testified
that
they
were
afraid
of
the
fbi.
many
witnesses
testified
that
the
fbi
told
them
that
we
can
charge
you
with
perjury
if
you
don't
tell
us
the
truth.
there
were
no
adults,
other
than
the
fbi
agents,
present
when
the
children
were
interviewed.
it
was
a
very,
we
think,
coercive
environment.
several
students
during
trial
testified
that
they
had
been
forced
by
the
fbi
to
make
up
stories
about
verl
hadley.
indeed,
one
of
the
victims
in
the
case--
mr.
john
trebon
--that's
true.
what
i'm
trying
to
show
in
this
case,
that
there
were
genuine
disputes
about
what
occurred
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
problem
with
404(b)
evidence
is
that
it
tends
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
jurors
away
from
the
facts
in
dispute
in
this
case,
and
tend
to
paint
the
defendant
as
a
bad
person
or
show
that
he
has
a
predisposition
for
committing
these
types
of
offenses,
and
in
this
case
that's
exactly
what
it
did.
the
prior
bad
act
evidence
was
absolutely
overwhelming.
it
was
very
prejudicial,
and
smeared
the
defendant,
so
that
the
facts
in
dispute
in
this
case
could
not
be
fairly
decided.
intent
was
the
basis
for
admitting
the
prior
bad
conduct
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
intent
in
this
case
was
merely
a
marginal
issue
required
by
federal
statute.
federal--
mr.
john
trebon
--yes,
chief
justice,
that's
true,
but
the
intent
required
in
this
case
was
merely
the
statute
follows
the
model
penal
code
which
requires
that
when
you
touch
someone
that
you
do
it
with
the
desire
to
harass,
humiliate,
to
arouse
or
satisfy
the
sexual
desire
of
any
person.
in
other
words,
it
was
placed
in
the
statute
merely
to
distinguish
innocent
or
accidental
touchings
from
intentional
or
sexual
touchings.
mr.
john
trebon
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
there,
and
the
government
does
have
to
prove
it.
my
point
here
is
that
there's
not
much
there
to
prove.
mr.
john
trebon
theoretically,
justice
kennedy,
that's
true,
but
no
such
defense
was
put
forward,
number
1,
and
number
2,
the
predicate
for
establishing,
if
the
government
needed
a
prior
bad
act
to
establish
what
was
going
on
in
count
ix,
was
established
by
count
viii.
mr.
john
trebon
yes.
he
occurred
that
both
count
viii
and
count
ix
acts
occurred,
and
count
viii,
of
course,
the
same
type
of
conduct
allegedly
went
further,
so
there
was
no
question
about
what
was
supposedly
taking
place
when
count
ix
evidence
was
presented.
count
viii
occurs
during
october
of
'87,
count
ix
evidence
occurs
during
november
of
1987,
so
again,
the
issue
of
intent
was
merely--
mr.
john
trebon
--justice
white,
we
are
not
saying
that
there's
a
per
se
rule.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
a
case
like
this--
mr.
john
trebon
--because
we
believe
that
rule
403
is
designed
to
give
trial
courts
broad
discretion,
and
we're
saying
that
the
offer
to
stipulate
as
to
the
issue
of
intent
should
have
been
a
factor
considered
under
rule
403,
and
moreover,
if
it
had
been
a
factor
considered
under
rule
403,
in
this
case
it
would
have
tipped
the
balance
in
favor
of
exclusion
of
all
this
massive
amount
of
prior
misconduct
evidence
to
prove
an
issue
of
intent
that
was
transparent
from
the
nature
of
the
acts
alone.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
justice
scalia,
first
of
all
it
could
have
never
been
considered
for
any
other
purpose
in
this
case.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
could
only
consider
the
evidence
for
motive,
intent
and
preparation,
and
planning,
number
1.
number
2--
mr.
john
trebon
--intent,
preparation,
and
planning.
mr.
john
trebon
right.
mr.
john
trebon
although
in
this
case
they
were
also
instructed...
when
the
jury
instruction
was
first
drafted
it
was
drafted
to
be
used
as
an
intent
instruction.
that
language
was
thrown
in
immediately
before
it
went
to
the
jury.
the
trial
court
also
instructed
the
jury
that
they
could
only
consider
the
evidence
if
they
found
that
the
acts
charged
in
the
indictment
had
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
other
words,
they
were
instructed
they
could
only
use
the
evidence
for
the
mental
state
of
mr.
hadley.
they
could
not
use
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
actus
reus
had
occurred.
therefore,
planning,
which
would
normally
go...
planning...
of
course,
the
planning
exception
clearly
doesn't
apply
here
anyway.
a
plan
is
a
two-stage
sequential
state
of
events
that
takes
place
where
both
are
in
the
minds
of
the
actor
at
the
time
that
one
crime
was
committed.
the
actor
has
in
mind
to
commit
another
crime
as
well.
for
example,
when
you
burglarize
a
gun
shop
so
that
you
can
get
a
gun
to
rob
a
bank.
that's
a
plan.
in
no
sense
of
the
plan,
with
the
meaning
of
plan
within
403
was
there
plan
in
this
case,
but
nevertheless,
they
were
specifically
instructed
they
couldn't
use
the
evidence
except
for
the
mental
state.
mr.
john
trebon
justice
scalia--
mr.
john
trebon
--it
would
have,
your
honor.
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
75.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
there's...
one
thing's
for
sure,
though,
i'm
sure
you'd
agree,
justice
scalia,
you
certainly
couldn't
use
the
evidence
now
for
some
basis
that
the
jury
couldn't
use
it
for.
it
would
be
impossible
for
this
court
to
affirm
the
conviction
on
some
other
allowable
basis
for
this
evidence
when
the
jury
in
this
case
couldn't
consider
it
for
that
purpose.
that
would
simply
be
impossible,
we
submit--
mr.
john
trebon
--and
no
one
is
arguing--
mr.
john
trebon
--in
other
words,
we
don't
know
how
much
calculus
the
jury
added
to
the
weight
of
this
evidence
at
trial,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
redetermine
that
if
we
submit
it
to
the
jury
for
another
purpose
when
we
know
they
didn't
consider
it
for
that
purpose.
in
this
particular
case,
we
know
that
we
couldn't
do
that.
i
don't
know
that...
if
you
have
another
case
involving
the
judge
as
a
trier
of
fact,
it
might
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
john
trebon
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
this
particular
instruction
i
believe
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
twice,
and
it's
on
page
75,
as
i
recall.
the
instruction
was
given
both
before
the...
or,
after
the
testimony
of
kyle
hartman
and
before
the
testimony
of
cory
k..
it
was
given
in
both
instances,
the
identical
instruction.
mr.
john
trebon
yes,
justice
souter,
that
is
true,
because
plan
does
have
to
involve
some
chain
of
events,
something
that's
in
the
mind
of
the
actor.
it's
not
a
substitute
as
a
weak
modus
operandi
exception,
and
it
was
never
part
of
this
case,
no.
the
prior
bad
acts,
unfortunately,
that
were
admitted
in
this
case,
occurred
13
to
17
years
earlier
in
the
case
of
kyle
hartman
and
several
years
earlier
in
the
case
of
cory
k.,
and
of
course
the
reason
that
they
were
so
prejudicial,
if
anyone
has
any
question
about
that,
is
because
they
were
unspecified.
when
the
government
filed
a
motion
in
limine
several
months
before
trial,
they
said
we
want
to
introduce
particular
prior
bad
acts
relating
to
three
people.
well,
two
of
those
people
recanted,
so
two
of
those
people
never
testified,
and
cory
k.
was
one
of
them,
but
when
he
got
on
the
stand
he
testified
about
numerous
unspecified
prior
bad
acts.
in
the
government's
brief,
they
concede
10
to
20
prior
bad
acts
between
he
and
mr.
hadley
that
we
had
no
prior
notice
of,
that
i
had
to
deal
with
on
cross-examination
for
the
first
time
and,
of
course,
in
kyle
hartman's
case--
mr.
john
trebon
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
does
to
the
extent
when
we
weigh
the
amount
of
evidence
necessary
to
establish
intent
in
this
case
and
we
weigh
the
heavy
amount
of
effect
that
the
prior
misconduct
evidence
had,
we
can
see,
i
hope
it
crystallizes
the
notion,
that
a
stipulation
would
have
taken
care
of
the
matter
or
significantly
changed--
mr.
john
trebon
--well,
actually,
in
rule
403,
unfai
surprise
was
kept
out
of
the
rule
itself
but
it's
in
the
comment,
and
it
says
that's
also
a
factor
for
the
trial
judge
to
consider.
if
there
hasn't
been
prior
notice
and
they're
surprised,
then
obviously
the
trial
court
should
naturally
weigh
against
the
introduction
of
such
evidence.
in
this
case,
it's
another
factor
to
attach
to
our
stipulation
or
proposed
judicial
admission
which
would
have
changed--
mr.
john
trebon
--i
think
in
the
usual
case
that
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
john
trebon
because
the
government
is
allowed
to
put
forth
its
full
evidence,
the
moral
force
of
its
evidence
on
the
elements
at
stake.
in
other
words,
if
they're
intrinsic
acts,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
acts
that
you're
trying
to
stipulate
out
of
the
case
are
intrinsic
to
the
case
itself--
mr.
john
trebon
--well,
i
think...
then
i
would
make
another
distinction.
if
you
intend
to
prove
one
of
those
elements
with
the
use
of
prior
misconduct
evidence
under
404(b),
then,
of
course,
you
have
to
consider
the
parallel
provisions
of
rule
403,
and
then
a
stipulation
must
be
a
factor
to
be
weighed
by
the
trial
court,
so
in
that
situation
i'd
say
you'd
at
least
have
to
weigh
it
out.
mr.
john
trebon
sure.
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
at
least
a
factor
the
trial
court
should
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
incremental
probative
value
of
the
evidence
is
outweighed
by
the
danger
of
unfair
prejudice,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
stipulation
would
have
easily
taken
care
of
the
problem.
we
had
an
issue
of
intent
that
was
necessarily
inferred
from
the
nature
of
the
act
alone.
i
mean,
there
was
no
question
that
if
someone
touched
someone
the
way
that
mr.
hadley
was
accused
of
doing,
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
crime,
that
he
was
touching
these
children
improperly.
it
was
indefensible
to
argue
otherwise,
and
no
one
did
and
no
one
could.
no
one
could
think
of
a
theoretical
case
within
the
facts
of
this
case
where
that
would
have
been
possible.
second
of
all,
there's
a
whole
line
of
cases
undisputed
by
the
government
here.
they
stay
away
from
all
these
lines
of
cases.
but
when
a
defendant
denies
participation
in
the
act,
then
he
or
she
does
not
usually
raise
intent
as
an
issue.
here,
our
sole
defense
at
trial,
put
forward
in
a
memorandum
filed
well
before
trial
itself,
was
that
mr.
hadley
did
not
commit
the
acts
in
question.
we
never
raised
any
kind
of
defense
that
he
could
have
done
these
acts
but
he
couldn't
have
been
guilty
of
the
mental
state
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
john
trebon
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
how
criminal
cases
are
different
than
civil
cases.
a
civil
case
you
could
plead
such
an
issue
out,
but
in
this
case
we
did
more
than
that,
of
course.
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
when
it
says
that
we
simply
focused
our
attention
on
some
other
defense.
we
did
not.
we
came
forward
and
affirmatively
stipulated
that
this
issue
could
be
taken
out
of
the
case.
mr.
john
trebon
yes.
mr.
john
trebon
we
believe
that's
the
error
below,
certainly
one
of
them.
we
offered
to
stipulate,
and
the
response
from
the
government
was,
we
won't
stipulate,
and
the
response
from
the
trial
court
was,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
make
the
government
stipulate.
mr.
john
trebon
i
think
the
government
should
have
been
required
to
stipulate
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
once
you
considered
the
fact
under
rule
403,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case
it
was
appropriate
to
accept
that
stipulation
in
lieu
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
trebon
i'm
sorry,
let
me
try
to
clarify
it.
i'm
saying
that
if
you
offer
to
stipulate
to
an
essential
element
of
the
statute
when
the
government
is
trying
to
admit
prior
bad
act
evidence
to
prove
that
point,
that
the
offer
to
stipulate
in
lieu
of
the
prior
bad
act
evidence
is
a
factor
that
the
trial
court
should
weigh
within
the
balancing
processes
of
rule
403.
mr.
john
trebon
justice
kennedy,
i
would
say
that
the
government
could
be
required
to
stipulate
instead
of
allowing
the
prior
bad
acts.
rule
403
comments
say
exactly
that.
mr.
john
trebon
yes.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
justice
scalia,
you're
correct,
although
i
suppose
my
position
now
would
be
that
now
that
the
government's
conceded
in
their
brief
that
everyone,
according
to
the
government,
agrees
that
it
should
be
a
factor
considered
under
rule
403,
i'd
like
to
go
on
and
convince
you
that
in
this
case
you
can
see
by
looking
at
the
relevant
factors
it
would
have
changed
the
equation,
that
if
the
stipulation
would
have
been
accepted,
then
the
need
for
this
evidence
is
obviously
trivial
and
the
prejudice
from
it
is
overwhelming.
in
other
words,
it
stopped
mr.
hadley
from
getting
a
fair
trial.
and
i
think
you
do
one
other
important
thing.
speaking
as
a
trial
lawyer
before
this
honorable
court,
the
practice
now
at
trial
is
for
the
prosecutor
to
come
in
at
the
trial
level
and
spotlight
one
of
the
other
purposes
under
rule
404(b)
as
a
facade
for
getting
masses
of
amounts
of
prior
misconduct
evidence
before
the
jury,
because
we
all
know...
i
think
the
comments
to
the
rules
support
it,
all
the
scholars
support
it,
and
a
milieu
of
case
law
supports
it--
mr.
john
trebon
--that
once
that
evidence
comes
in,
it's
misused.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
i
think
that
both...
justice
white,
you
and
justice
scalia
are
correct
when
you
say
that
if...
there's...
a
possible
remedy
in
this
case
is
to
send
it
back.
in
other
words,
that's
right,
the
trial
court
applied
the
rule
wrongly
when
it
didn't
offer
to
consider
the
stipulation.
mr.
john
trebon
only
if
it's
allowed
by
the
trial
court
when
it
weighs
all
the
factors
under
rule
403.
mr.
john
trebon
i
am
not
urging
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
john
trebon
justice
white,
you're
exactly
right,
i
am
not
urging
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
john
trebon
i
hope
not.
mr.
john
trebon
exactly.
mr.
john
trebon
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
adopted
per
se
rules.
mr.
hadley's
advocating
a
balancing
test
under
rule
403
in
which
the
stipulation
would
simply
be
considered
as
a
relevant
factor.
the
comments
to
rule
401
say
exactly
that,
that
the
offer
to
concede
a
point
may
result
in
the
exclusion
of
evidence.
that's
what
the
comments
to
rule
401
expressly
says.
that's
what
we
asked
that
the
court
do
in
this
case.
it
unequivocally
refused
to
do
so
because
the
government
refused
to
enter
into
the
stipulation.
we
submit
to
you
that
had
403
been
correctly
applied
in
this
case,
and
the
stipulation
considered
in
good
faith,
it
would
have
changed
the
calculus
or
the
equation--
mr.
john
trebon
--at
least
consider
it
under
the--
mr.
john
trebon
--with
other
factors.
mr.
john
trebon
yes,
justice
white,
that's
right,
at
least
consider
it
with
other
factors.
mr.
john
trebon
it
is.
in
fact,
the
circuits
are
split
in
varying
forms,
in
varying
complex
forms,
about
exactly
what
you
do
with
an
offer
to
concede.
the
second
circuit
has
the
most
elaborate
test.
other
circuits
have
employed
other
tests.
only
the
seventh
circuits
and
ninth
circuits
say
that
they
have
a
per
se
rule
against
them
whenever
a
specific
intent
crime
has
been
charged.
both
of
the
circuit
courts--
mr.
john
trebon
--i
think
that
that's
what
the
trial
court
in
many
ways,
quite
honestly,
justice
kennedy,
wanted
to
do,
but
it
gave
him
a
jury
instruction
that
said
they
couldn't
do
it.
there's
no
sexual
propensity
exception
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
john
trebon
absolutely.
i
don't
see
much
of
a
distinction
between
what
the
government's
arguing
and
a
pure
propensity
argument.
even
in
huddleston,
the
chief
justice
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court
started
the
opinion
off
by
saying
no
one
questioned
in
that
case
whether
or
not
the
goods
were
stolen.
the
only
question
was
whether
or
not
the
person
in
possession
of
the
goods
knew
that
they
were
stolen.
the
chief
justice
characterized
that
second
question
as
the
only
material
issue
in
the
case,
and
the
only
material
issue
in
this
case,
of
course,
has
to
be
his
intent
and
not
propensity.
you
can't
use
evidence--
mr.
john
trebon
--there
are
in
some
of
the
states.
mr.
john
trebon
absolutely
not,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
i
thought
that
was
some
of
the
cause
for
confusion
below,
because
the
government
in
its
original
motion
in
limine
filed,
i
think,
in
november
of
'87
cited
some
arizona
cases,
and
even
the
arizona
exception...
in
arizona,
you
can
allow
sexual
propensity
evidence
as
an
exception
to
404,
but
only
if
you
approve
it
or
offer
it
along
with
expert
testimony
showing
that
there
really
is
a
mental
predisposition
on
the
part
of
this
person
to
act
in
a
certain
way.
the
government
didn't
even
offer
that
predicate
evidence
in
order
to
get
it
in,
and
quite
clearly,
no,
all
the
commenters,
justice
kennedy,
conclude
that
you
cannot
offer
sexual
propensity
evidence
under
the
federal
rules.
there's
no
such
exception.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
pending
from
the
court
at
this
moment,
i
will
reserve
my
final
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
trebon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
exception
under
rule
404(b)
for
a
weak
modus
operandi
case.
that
does
not
somehow
become
corroboration,
that
does
not
somehow
become
plan.
modus
operandi
evidence
is
admitted
to
show
identity.
there
was
no
identity
issue
in
this
case,
number
1,
and
number
2,
there
was
no
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
these
acts
were
so
similar
as
to
constitute
modus
operandi.
there
was
no
signature
to
crime
in
this
case.
moreover,
corroboration
evidence
is
no
different
than
propensity
evidence
unless
it
corroborates
the
act
on
trial.
you
cannot
call
someone
as
a
corroboration
witness
if
they
speak
about
a
different
act.
they
have
to
corroborate
the
specific
act
on
trial.
that's
corroboration.
if
corroboration
is
used
so
broadly
that
if
crime
a
is
on
trial
and
you
corroborate
to
another
person
that
crime
b
was
committed,
that's
not
corroborating
what's
on
trial,
that's
simply
propensity
evidence.
there's
no
difference
between
the
two.
all
the
commenters
say
so.
professor
imwenkerlied
and
others
say
that
that
is
a
false
use
of
corroboration
testimony
in
order
to
get
around
404(b)
and
403.
that
is
simply
unallowable
in
this
case.
secondly,
following
up
on
justice
kennedy,
let
me
tell
you
that
the
acts
in
this
case
were
not
that
similar
anyway.
counts
vii
and
viii
involving
amadee
r.
take
place
inside
of
a
car.
the
acts
that
they
want
you
to
believe
that
it's
similar
to
are
supposedly
full-blown
sodomy
attempts
in
a
bedroom
with
lotion
and
all
the
things
that
they
put
in
their
brief,
none
of
which
existed
in
counts
vii
and
viii.
they
simply
were
not
very
similar
at
all.
there
was
no
use
of
that
evidence
for
purposes
of
corroboration
in
this
case.
when
we
offered
to
stipulate,
we
offered
to
stipulate
intent
out
of
the
case
unequivocally.
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
full
force
and
validity
of
our
stipulation.
what
the
government
is
telling
you
now
is
that
judge
carroll
didn't
like
the
stipulation.
judge
carroll
didn't
want
to
add
anything
to
our
stipulation
relating
to
the
element
of
the
crime.
he
wanted
me
to
stipulate
that
the
prior
bad
acts
had
occurred.
it
didn't
make
any
sense.
why
would
i
have
to
stipulate
that
the
prior
bad
acts
had
occurred?
the
only
thing
in
question
was
intent,
and
i
offered
a
stipulation
or
concession,
if
you
will,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
was
satisfied
to
a
concession.
the
comment
to
rule
401
says
that
the
trial
court
should
consider
concession
on
a
point
at
trial
in
lieu
of
actual
evidence
in
order
to
exclude
that
evidence,
especially
404(b)
evidence.
mr.
john
trebon
yes.
mr.
john
trebon
yes.
we
deny
that
he
touched
them...
the
particular
acts
in
question.
certainly
we
didn't
deny
that
he
may
have
tickled
them
on
the
playground
as
their
teacher,
and
so
forth,
but
we
denied
all
of
the
acts
in
question.
so
this
was
a
trial
about
whether
or
not
these
acts
occurred,
or
whether
or
not
they
were
prompted,
similarly
to
many
other
witnesses
who
testified
at
trial,
prompted
by
the
fbi
to
make
accusations
against
mr.
hadley.
it
was
a
case
that
necessitated
a
full-blown
exploration
on
the
particular
acts
in
question,
and
all
we
did
by
admitting
all
the
prior
bad
act
evidence
is
to
change
the
focus
of
the
trial
to
events
that
occurred
13
to
17
years
earlier,
and
certainly
was
extremely
prejudicial.
all
the
commenters
in
all
the
cases
say
that
emotional...
that
the
emotional
propensity
of
child
molestation
is
extremely
high,
and
limiting
instructions
in
this
area
are
very
ineffective.
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
can
have
it
both
ways
with
the
jury
instruction,
too.
you
can't
say
judge
carroll
had
this
broad
idea
about
plan
evidence
but
yet
instructed
the
jury
that
they
couldn't
consider
the
evidence
for
anything
other
than
mental
state.
you
had
to
determine
independently
whether
or
no
the
acts
occurred
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
clearly
none
of
this
evidence
could
have
been
considered
at
the
trial
level
to
determine
the
actus
reus
of
the
case.
that's
simply
implausible
under
the
jury
instruction
that
was
given
by
judge
carroll.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
this
was
admitted
for
a
limited
purpose,
as
all
404(b)
is.
you
only
can
admit
404(b)
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
identify
one
of
the
other
purposes
that
it's
allowed
for
under
the
rule,
and,
as
this
court
noted
in
huddleston...
indeed,
as
mr.
chief
justice
wrote
for
a
unanimous
court,
under
rule
105
you
have
to
give
a
limiting
instruction
if
it's
requested
when
404(b)
evidence
is
admitted.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
i
think
it
makes...
it
gives
the
government
a
major
problem
if
they're
trying
to
tell
you
now
that
that
evidence
should
have
been
used
for
some
other
purpose,
number
1.
it
couldn't
have
been,
because
the
trier
of
fact
couldn't
have
used
it
in
some
other
fashion.
second
of
all,
i
would
have
cross-examined
witnesses
differently,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
thought
that
this
was
going
to
be
corroboration
evidence
rather
than
going
to
the
mental
intent
that
the
judge
had
just
given
to
the
jury,
i
would
have
had
to
delve
deeper
in
my
cross-examination
of
some
of
these
witnesses,
especially
kyle
hartman,
who
i
didn't
cross-examine
at
all...
hardly
at
all.
so
it
would
have
changed
the
complexity
of
the
trial.
it's
impossible
to
reshape
that
now,
i
would
submit
to
you.
my
cross-examination
would
have
been
different,
and
the
jury's
mental
processes
would
have
been
different.
second
of
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
take
the
issue
head
on.
mr.
john
trebon
at
my
request
the
instructions
were
given
to
the
jury
simultaneously
with
the
testimony
of
the
prior
bad
act
witnesses.
it
was
given
at
the
time
that
they
testified.
