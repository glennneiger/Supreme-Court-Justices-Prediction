justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
count
ix,
i
take
it
that
there
could
have
been
a
plausible
defense
that
the
actions
did
occur
but
that
they
were
innocent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
deny
that
the
count
ix
acts
occurred
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
another
way
of
saying
that
is
the
government
can
be
required
to
stipulate
as
a
precondition
to
the
admission
of
the
prior
bad
acts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
trial
judge
in
his
comments
seemed
to
say
that
an
important
factor
was...
in
admitting
the
evidence
was
the
difficulty
of
proof
in
crimes
like
this,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
child
whose
english
was
either
a
second
language
or
he
was
not
as
proficient
in
english
as
some
children
are.
does
this
go
really
further
than
his
express
rationale
of
admitting
it
just
for
intent?
does
it
show
that
he's
admitting
it
just
for
propensity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
read
the
government's
brief
as
advocating
such
a
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
is
a
propensity
rule
for
sexual
molestation
crimes--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
there
is
in
a
state,
is
the...
may
a
district
court
refer
to
that
rule
in
trying
a
case
under
the...
in
the
federal
court
under
the
rules
of
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
thought
you
began
by
saying
that
you
would
agree
that
the
willingness
to
stipulate
or
not
should
be
a
factor
in
the
403
balancing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
their
testimony
would
also
bear
on
whether
or
not
the
acts
occurred,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
90
percent
of
the
thrust
of
the
testimony
is
whether
or
not
the
acts
occurred,
and
90
percent
of
the
corroboration
that
you
obtained
by
introducing
these
prior
acts
is
that
the
acts
occurred,
and
that
intent
is
not
fictional,
but
it
is
de
minimis
or
insignificant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
to
submit
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
were
limited
to
his
answers
on
cross-examination
under
the
evidence
code,
or
am
i
missing
something?
i
thought
to
impeach
by
prior
bad
acts
you
simply
ask
on
cross-examination,
you
don't
introduce
extrinsic
evidence--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that's
different
than
impeachment
under
608.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
don't
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
then
you
simply
supplant
the
608
balancing
test
with
no
balancing
test
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
a
case
occur
to
you
that
i
could
read
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
608
is
simply
for
collateral
matters.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
--could
you
have
made
the
same
argument
you
make
here
if
you
had
just
count
ix
in
the
indictment,
which
was
the
business
in
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
trailer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me.
what
if
you
had
just
counts
vii
and
viii--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
was
automobile,
and
not
count
ix?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there
was
nothing
similar
about
vii
and
viii
and
what
cory
testified
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
just
an
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
to
get
the
record
straight,
cory
k.
didn't
testify
to
an
incident
sitting
on
a
lap
in
an
automobile,
did
he?
