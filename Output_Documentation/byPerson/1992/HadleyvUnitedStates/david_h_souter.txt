justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
correct
that
plan
was
neither
an
element
of
any
offense
charged
nor
an
issue
in
the
case
as
it
was
tried?
justice
david
h.
souter
would--
--and--
--in
which
case
you're
using
the
prior
specific
bad
acts
in
effect
to
prove
propensity,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--well,
you
don't...
oh,
excuse
me.
go
ahead,
sir.
go
ahead.
i
was
going
to
say
you
don't
need
the
intermediate
inference
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
never
going
to
have
a
propensity
case
if
your
theory
is
correct,
because
nobody
is
ever
going
to
want
to
waste
time
relying
on
the
intermediate
step.
they'll
follow
your
theory
of
probability.
he'd
do
it
once,
he
probably
did
it
twice.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
i'll
accept
that,
but
it
ends
up,
it
seems
to
me,
subject
to
the
same
objection.
if
your
doctrine
of
chances
theory
is
correct,
nobody
is
ever
going
to
waste
time
on
the
intermediate
premise
of
propensity
because
they're
not
going
to
need
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
is,
it
seems
to
me
you've
swallowed
the
propensity
rule
just
about
whole.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
get
out
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
that
case,
you
wouldn't
have
a
relevant
propensity.
justice
david
h.
souter
--how
were
they
in
issue
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
whenever
there's
a
modus
operandi
that
could
be
inferred
prior
bad
acts
are
automatically
admissible.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
on
the
basis
of
that
stipulation,
had
it
been
accepted,
wouldn't
it
have
been
proper
for
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they...
that
if
they
found
that
the
acts
charged
occurred,
they
could
take
that
as
sufficient
proof
of
the
intent
required,
i.e.,
sexual
gratification.
that
would
have
been
a
proper
instruction,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
also
the
case,
isn't
it,
mr.
bryson,
even
though
there
was
not
in
fact
a
final
stipulation,
that
the
trial
judge
could
have
considered...
in
determining
whether
to
keep
out
the
prior
acts,
he
could
have
considered
an
offer
on
the
defendant's
part
that
if
you
keep
them
out
you
may
instruct
the
jury
in
the
manner
i
just
suggested.
that
would
have
been
perfectly
proper,
and
there
would
have
been
no
error
in
the
judge's
doing
so,
would
there...
no
error
that
could
have
been--
justice
david
h.
souter
--raised
by
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
virtually
at
the
same
level
of
two
bank
robberies.
if
your...
i
mean,
if
that's
going
to
be
an
appropriate
argument,
then
you
can
say
whenever
he
robbed
one
bank
you
can
introduce
evidence
that
he
robbed
a
prior
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
unusual.
