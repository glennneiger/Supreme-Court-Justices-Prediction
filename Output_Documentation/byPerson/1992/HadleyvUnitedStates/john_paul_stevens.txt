are
the
instructions
in
the
appendix
that
you
refer
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
before
you
leave
the
relevance--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--part
of
your
three
steps,
you
argue
three
grounds
of
relevance
in
your
brief
as
i
read
it.
at
pages
20-21,
is
it
relevant
to
whether
the
petitioner
had
physical
contact
with
the
boy,
secondly,
to
state
of
mind,
and
thirdly
to
motive.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
of
the
three
relevancies
that
you
identify,
do
you
think
that
was
consistent
with
the
judge's
instruction
that
your
opponent
described
to
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
your
first
point
is
the
question
whether
petitioner
had
physical
contact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
was
relevant
to
that,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that's
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
judge's
instruction
that
you
may
not
consider
the
evidence
without
first
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
facts
occurred--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
he
did
say
that
unambiguously.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
says
you
can't
consider
it
unless
you
first
find
that
the
other
evidence
in
the
case
standing
alone
establishes
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mr.
hadley
did
the
particular
acts
charged
in
the
indictment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
would
include
that
the...
whether
they
had
physical
contact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
point,
and
if
i
understand
you,
is
that
even
if
the
government
had
stipulated
to
intent,
the
evidence
still
would
have
been
admissible
because
it
corroborated
the
physical
fact...
physical
act
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
was
all
done
to
try
and
convince
the
trier
of
fact
that
the
particular
acts
in
dispute
didn't
happen
because
i'm
not
that
kind
of
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
your
intent...
would
make
everything
relevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
could
i
just
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
assume
we
had
a
bank
robbery
case
before
us,
and
the
defendant
had
been
previously
convicted
of
another
bank
robbery,
could
the
government
begin
its
case
by
offering
in
evidence
the
prior
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
all
there
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
both
banks
in
small
towns
in
michigan.
that's
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
i
understand
identity.
we
don't
have
an
identity
problem.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
act
occurred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just...
you
aren't
taking
the
position
that
you
can
always
introduce
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--showing
whether
the
act
occurred.
that's
the
issue
for
which
you
want
to
offer
it.
no--
--oh,
well,
here
it's
whether
the
defendant
performed
the
act
with
which
he
is
charged.
you
say,
bank
robbery,
it
might
be
because
you
have
an
identity
question
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here
if
he'd
been
convicted
of
a
molestation
of
a
child
10
years
ago,
you
could
start
off
with
putting
that
evidence
in.
