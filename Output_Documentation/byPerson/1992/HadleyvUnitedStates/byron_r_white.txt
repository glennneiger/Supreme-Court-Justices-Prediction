justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to...
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
just
as
a
per
se
rule
that
if...
there's
a
stipulation
about
intent,
that
if
these
acts
occurred,
they
occurred
intentionally,
that
that...
then
no
prior
conduct
evidence
should
be
admitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
aren't
you?
the
intent
would
never
be
at
issue
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
just
asking
us
to
disagree
with
the
two
courts
below
that
this
evidence
was
admissible
and
that
it
wasn't
too
prejudicial,
and
you
say
it
shouldn't
have
been
admitted
because
the
equation
was
such
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
admitted,
which
means
that
this
is
just
sort
of
a
fact-bound
argument
about
the
application
of
the
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
where
i
got
the
idea...
i
must
have
misread
your
brief...
that
you
were
asking
for
a
rule
that
if
you
offer
to
stipulate,
the
prior
crimes
evidence
is
automatically
excluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
so
it's...
you
weren't
urging...
aren't
urging
a
per
se
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
it's
just
an
argument
over
the
application
of
these
two
rules,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
so
you
are,
then,
asking
that
always
if
there's
an
offer
to
stipulate,
that
the
court
should
entertain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
entertain
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
a
question
of
law,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bryson,
we
did
grant
certiorari
on
the
intent
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
major
thrust
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
said
you
were
prepared
to
argue
the
case
on
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
got...
you
said
that
there's
a
three
step...
you
started
out
to
give
us
three
steps
of
what
your
position
is
and
you
were
talking
about
relevance.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
government
didn't
agree
to
stipulate,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
refused,
but
nevertheless
the
judge,
you
say,
considered
the
offer
as
a
factor
in
the
balance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that...
you'd
never
get...
you
couldn't
use
that
evidence,
that
one
act
to
prove
the...
to
prove
a
later
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
don't
you
have
to
prove
that
what
you've
indicted
him
for
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
bank
robbery,
anyway.
you
have
to
prove
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
take
it
in...
here,
you
indict
someone
for
child
molestation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you're
going
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know.
i
suppose,
though,
you're
going
to
put
the
woman
who
made
the
complaint
on
the
stand
and
say
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
what
you're
going
to
start
off
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's...
but
you
can't
get
away
with
proving
this...
proving
what
the
complainant
said
this
man
did
by
just...
without
anything
else,
without
even
putting
her
on
the
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
use
it
to
prove
intent.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
deny
that
your
client
touched
these
students?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
all.
