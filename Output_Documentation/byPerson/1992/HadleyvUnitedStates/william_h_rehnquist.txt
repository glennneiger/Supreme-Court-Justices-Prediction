chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-6646,
verl
hadley
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
trebon.
is
it
trebon,
or
trebon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
trebon.
mr.
trebon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
trebon,
how
does
this
bear
on
the
questions
presented
here,
which
seem
to
deal
mostly
with
rule
403?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
an
issue
like
any
other
element
of
a
crime
in
which
the
government
bears
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
still
there,
and
the
government
has
to
prove
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this,
too,
doesn't
really
bear
on
the
question
presented,
does
it,
the
fact
that
one
witness
may
have
surprised
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
understand
that
point,
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
point
is
aided
by
your
contention
that
you
had
no
notice
of
what
this
witness
was
going
to
testify
to,
that
you
were
surprised.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
have
a
crime
defined
as
consisting
of
four
elements,
do
you
think
a
defendant
can
come
into
court
and
say,
i'll
stipulate
to
three
of
these
elements
and
therefore
the
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
introduce
any
evidence
on
those
three
and
we'll
just
try
one
element?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
talking
about
elements
of
the
crime
to
stipulate
out
of
a
case,
and
not
acts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
anytime,
then,
that
a
defendant
offers
to
stipulate
to
an
element
of
a
crime
charged,
and
the
government
wishes
to
use
some
sort
of
prior
bad
acts
evidence,
the
stipulation
is
a
factor
regardless
of
anything
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
the
fact
you
don't
raise
a
defense
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
prove
that
element.
i
mean,
it's
not
like
a
civil
action
where
the
defendant
comes
in
and
pleads
defenses.
you're
not
guilty
plea
raises
every
question
of
the
element.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
affirmatively
offered
to
stipulate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
did
not
join
in
your
stipulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
government
should
have
been
required
to
stipulate?
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--you
said
that
a
moment
ago
that
for...
if
the
government's
going
to
use
bad
acts
evidence
and
refuses
to
stipulate,
that
should
be
a
factor,
an
admission
of
bad
acts.
now
you
say
the
government
couldn't
refuse
to
stipulate.
i
thought...
that
isn't
quite
the
same
as
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
based
on
the
facts--
--you
abandon,
then,
your
question
3?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
appropriate
for
federal
courts
to
adopt
a
per
se
rule
of
admissibility
in
favor
of...
oh,
i
see,
this...
you're
opposing
that
sort
of
a
per
se--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
trebon.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
is
it,
mr....
are
you
referring
to
something
that's
in
the
transcript?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
stipulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
an
offer
to
stipulate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
trial
court
could
have
charged
the
jury
with
respect
to
an
offer
to
stipulate
which
was
never
accepted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
are
you...
you're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
not
talking
just
about
impeachment
without
any
other
relevance,
you're
talking
about
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
some--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--some
issue
in
the
trial
as...
and
it
kind
of
happens
to
impeach.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
we
concur
in
the
view
that
both
you
and
your
opponent
expressed
that
the
offer
to
stipulate
should
be
a
factor
taken
into
consideration
by
the
district
court
in
its
balancing,
but
nonetheless
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
do
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ought
we
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
it
to
consider
that,
or
should
we
consider
it
here?
what
should
we
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
trebon,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
instruction
was
in
fact
wrong?
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
admissability
of
evidence,
not
its
use
by
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
if
the
limiting
instruction
was
unduly
restrictive?
how
does
that
bear
on
the
issues
that
are
presented
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
trebon.
the
case
is
submitted.
