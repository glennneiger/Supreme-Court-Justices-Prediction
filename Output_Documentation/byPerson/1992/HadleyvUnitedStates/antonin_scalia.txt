mr.
trebon,
the
government
contends
that
there
were
other
purposes
for
introducing
it
that
supported
its
relevance
in
the
case
and
not
just
its
relevance
to
the
intent.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
motive...
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
intent,
preparation,
and
planning.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
beyond
intent,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
plan
could
cover
such
things
as,
you
know,
why
he
invited
children
to
his
home.
you
know,
it's
charged
that
that's
one
of
the
ways
that
one
of
the
charged
touchings
occurred,
but...
and
evidence
was
introduced
that
he
had
done
that
with
other
children
before.
i
mean,
all
of
that
would
go
to
whether
he
had
planned
the
enterprise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
must
say
that
if
the
instruction
was
you
must
first
establish
from
other
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
acts
occurred,
then
it
would
have
been
irrelevant
to
the
planning,
wouldn't
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
maybe
that
instruction
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
right?
you
mean,
whenever
there's
a
mistake
in
the
instruction,
all
evidence
that
is
rendered
irrelevant
by
that
mistake
was
therefore
improperly
admitted?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you're
not
even
arguing
you're
not
even
going
that
far
here.
all
you
really
have
to
establish,
i
guess,
is
that
at
least
it
should
have
been
taken
into
account.
what
you're
arguing
here
is
not
that
it
necessarily
should
have
been
excluded
because
there
was
no
stipulation,
but
at
least
you
should
have
considered
the
refusal
to
stipulate
in
deciding
whether
should
have
been
admitted
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
would
remove
any
doubts,
but
he
says
you
can't
even
use
it
unless
you
don't
have
any
doubts.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
you
have
to
have
been
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
you're
back--
--you're
back--
--to
the
intent
issue
again.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
trying
to
find
out
if
there's
some
other
purpose,
other
than
intent,
for
which
it
was
properly--
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
just
don't
agree
with
you.
suppose
i
think
that
this
instruction
just
excludes
any
other
purpose
except
intent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
possible
that
it
was
properly
admitted
but
improperly
excluded
from
the
jury's
consideration--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
the
instruction
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
or
even
at
a
narrower
level
of
generality,
you
were
not
trying
to
get
in
merely
evidence
that
this
person
had
abused
children
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
asserting
is
that
the
nature
in
which
he
went
about
conducting
the
abuse
was
the
same
as
had
been
testified
to
by
these
children,
used
the
same
guile,
the
same
ruses,
and
so
forth,
not
merely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
he
was
a
person
who
liked
to
abuse
children.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
the
stipulation
inadequate?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
merely
telling
the
jury,
look
it's
conceded
he
had
the
intent
if
he
did
the
acts.
why
wasn't
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
he
should
have
let
him
use
it
for
that,
even
if
he
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
those
instructions
were
given
at
the
end.
i
mean,
after
you've
gone
through
all
that,
right?
had
he
made
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
that's
the
instruction
he
was
going
to
give?
