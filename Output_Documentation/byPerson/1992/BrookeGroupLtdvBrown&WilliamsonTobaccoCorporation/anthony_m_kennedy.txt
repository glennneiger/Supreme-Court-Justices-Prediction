justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
i
understand
the
instructions,
the
jury
could
have
found
in
your
favor
even
if
it
made
no
finding
that
the
sales
were
below
average
variable
cost.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
the
argument
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
your
theory
of
the
case
that
this
is
part
of
your
burden,
to
show
that
it
was
below
average
variable
cost?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
the
difference
between
a
sherman
act
section
2
claim
and
a
robinson-patman
act
claim?
and
beyond
that,
i
want
to
know
could
you
have
brought
this
suit
as
a
section
2
sherman
act
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
are
all
factual
arguments.
there's
no
legal
difference
between
you
and
the
petitioner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
areeda,
i
suppose,
would
disagree
and
say
that
your
position
is
that
this
sort
of
suit
simply
cannot
be
maintained
when
an
oligopoly
is
the
defendant...
when
an
oligopolist
is
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
that
mr.
areeda's
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
understand
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of
the
nature
of
this
particular
market.
