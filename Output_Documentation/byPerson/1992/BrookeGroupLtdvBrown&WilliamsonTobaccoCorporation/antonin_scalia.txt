justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
discriminatory,
in
what
respect
were
they
discriminatory
here?
as
between
different
wholesalers,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
how
that
discrimination
would
hurt
a
small
wholesaler,
one
that
does
not
buy
in
high
volume.
i
do
not
see
how
that
discrimination
is
a
form
of
discrimination
that...
that
in
any
way
focuses
in
upon
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
it
covered
discrimination
of
this
kind
in
order
to
protect
the
person
who's
being
discriminated
against.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
just
don't
see
how
your
client
is
being
discriminated
against
by
this
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
it
is...
i
don't...
i
still
don't
see
why
the
discrimination
facilitates
the
scheme.
i
mean
what...
it
would
seem
to
me
the
scheme
would
be
even
more
effective
if
you
didn't
just
offer
these
below-cost
prices
to
some
people,
but
if
you
extended
them
even
further
to
everybody,
inflicting
even
more
punishment
upon
the
person
you're
seeking
to...
to
predate,
if...
if
that's
a
verb.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what
your...
the
officers
of
your
client
testified.
i
thought
they...
they
testified
that
it
was
a
competitive
industry.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you...
can
you
contradict
that,
i
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
the
project
wouldn't
be
successful,
though,
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
price
gap
was
narrowed
but
the
volume
of
the...
of
the
generics
increased
substantially.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
it
did,
here,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
you
can...
you
don't
achieve
anything
by
a
bit
of
a
narrowing
if
the
volume
of
the...
of
the
generics
increases.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends...
it
depends
on...
on
what
the
volume
increase
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
compared
to
the
price
differential,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
areeda,
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
the
predator
in
this
situation
had
to
anticipate
was
not
only
the
ability
to
recoup
later,
but
also
that
the
other
oligopolists
would
not...
would
not
think
that
the
predator
was
seriously
trying
to
sell
in
the...
in
the
off-brand
market,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why...
why
would...
why
would
you
be
confident
about
that?
and
certainly
the
outcome
doesn't
justify
the
confidence
because
a
lot
of
other
people
got
in
quite
substantially,
didn't
they.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
also
says
that
somebody
else
will
go
in
if
we
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
and
it's
a
strange
attitude
for
a
predator
to
take.
why
should
i...
why
i
take
the
loss
if
somebody
else
will
come
in,
and
her
notes
say
someone
else
will
pm/rjr
sooner
if
we
don't
go
in.
why...
let
somebody
else
do
the
predation
and
i'll
reap
the
profits.
why
should
i...
why
should
i
be
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--take
the
losses.
i
can't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
this
suit
commenced?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
was
what
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
some...
some
of
the...
some
of
the...
the
suit
was
going
on
during
some
of
this
period
when
the
gap
had
actually
increased.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the...
what
would
the
result
of
that
be,
then?
it
would
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
i
mean,
just
somebody
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
a
shot
at
saying
whether
the
district
court's
theory
was
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
decided
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i
was...
i
was
referring
to
the
olson
memorandum
which
specifically
said
that
if
we
don't
get
in,
these
other
two
will
get
in.
