mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
just
clarifying
the
question
of
issues.
we
have
only
the
issue
of
competitive
injury
here
today.
the
issues
of
antitrust
injury
and
causation,
as
well
as
new
trial
motions,
were
before
the
fourth
circuit
and
were
not
decided
and
remain
to
be
decided
if
need
be.
now,
let
me
go
to
the
jury
question.
what
i
intend
to
show,
discuss
is
oligopolistic
coordination,
which
liggett
claims,
recoupment
which
they
claim,
and
intent
to
predate.
i
can
show
you,
i
think,
from
uncontested
facts
that
none
of
those
things
exist.
so
that--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor.
this
is
entirely--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--mr....
justice
kennedy,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
his
position--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--you
mean
his
position
about
my
position?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that's
right.
but
that's--
[laughter]
--but
i
don't
accept
it
and
i
hope
i
can
not
stop
from
denying
that
that's
my
position.
no,
i
think
oligopolistic
predation
could
occur
in
some
circumstances.
i
don't
think
it
could
occur
in
this
circumstance,
and
i
think...
i'm
sure
that
it
did
not
and
i
can
prove
that
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
because
of
that
and
also
because...
we've
heard
that
brown
&
williamson
predicted
and
planned
this
whole
campaign.
you
will
see
that
there's
not
a
single
document
in
this
appendix
or
in
the
record
anywhere
that
shows
any
such
prediction
or
planning.
we're
told
that,
in
fact,
they
went
out
and
got
the
cooperation
of
their
fellow
oligopolists.
you
will
see
from
the
facts
they
did
not.
we're
told
that
the
gap...
they
tried
to
narrow
the
gap
between
generic
cigarettes
and
full-price
branded
cigarettes.
that
did
not
happen
either
and
liggett's
chart
shows
it.
and
we're
told
they
have
an
intent
to
predate,
and
i
can
show
you
that
there's
no...
there's
no
evidence
for
that
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
white,
said
what
liggett
says
they
said.
they
said
that
the
economic
theory
here
was--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
indeed.
they
said
the
facts
here
don't
bear
out
liggett's
theory,
and
the
facts
do
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
well,
they
said
it
was
not
in
this
case.
and...
and
furthermore,
they
relied
heavily
upon
the
document
called
the
final
proposal
that
brown
&
williamson
made
to
its
parent
corporation
just
before
entering
generics,
after
doral
had
been
introduced
by
rjr.
and,
indeed,
that
final
proposal
is
a
crucial
document
here,
and
i
think
they
were
quite
correct
to
rely
upon
it.
but
i
wanted
to
meet
first
the
assertion
that
there
is
a
jury
verdict
here
which
must
be
respected.
the
facts
here
are
such
that
even
if
the
jury
had
answered
special
interrogatories
finding
all
of
the
things
that
liggett
says
they
found,
i
think
j.n.o.v.
would
have
been
proper
because
there
are
no
facts
to
back
up...
there
would
be
no
facts
to
back
up
such
a
verdict.
but
in
fact,
as
we've
said
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
dwell
upon
it
at
length,
these
instructions
the
judge
gave
clearly
permit
the
jury
to
find
liability
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
intent
of
bad
intent,
generalized
bad
intent
in
brown
&
williamson
documents.
and,
indeed,
that's
what
liggett
argued
to
the
judge,
that
bad
intent
plus
injury
to
liggett
was
enough.
and
he
instructed...
if
you
look
at
instructions
16,
18,
and
29,
you
will
see
that
the
jury
always
was
given
alternative
ways
to
find
liability
here.
and
we
have
expanded
that
in
our
brief--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--no,
but
i'm...
the
point
i'm
making
here,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
you
can
infer
nothing
from
the
jury
verdict
because
of
the
instructions.
that
is
the
jury
was
given
an
impermissible
route
to
find
b&w
liable,
and
that
route
was
simply
aggressive
or
bad
statements
in
pre-doral
documents.
and
instructions
16,
18,
and
29
clearly
offer
the
jury
that
choice.
and
moreover,
when
the
jury,
on
the
eighth
day
of
its
deliberations,
said
the
written
instructions
it
had
before
were
kind
of
confusing
and
it
needed
help
on
the
question
of
competitive
injury,
the
judge
gave
an
off-the-cuff
oral
statement
in
which
he
stressed
bad
intent
and
a
generic
submarket,
which,
of
course,
he
later
said
shouldn't
have
been
in
the
case.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
almost
probable
that
the
jury
found
b&w
guilty
for
some
aggressive
statements
in
its
documents.
we
had
a...
we
requested
instruction
that
we
had
to
sell
below
cost,
intend
to
sell
below
cost.
the
judge
agreed,
but
didn't
give...
and
the
jury
could
have
found,
if
you
look
at
those
instructions,
that
b&w
is
liable
on
the
basis
of
pre-doral
bad
statements
in
documents,
without
finding
any
oligopolistic
coordination,
without
finding
any
below
cost
pricing,
without
finding
any
prospect
of
recoupment,
and
in
reliance
on
a
nonexistent
generic
submarket.
but
let
me
get
on
to
the...
the
merits
of
the
case,
because
i
said
that
there's...
the
jury
verdict
really
tells
us
nothing.
and,
in
fact,
the
case
should
be
reversed
for
that
reason
alone,
because
a
jury
which
is
allowed
to
find
liability
solely
on
bad
intent,
i
think
has
just...
i
think
that
violates
this
court's
ruling
in
spectrum
sports.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
what
it
said
is
accurate
to
this
extent,
justice
o'connor.
membership
in
an
oligopoly
alone
is
not
proof
of
illegal
conduct,
but
the...
the
court
very
carefully
said
that
it
was
not
ruling
out
liggett's
theory
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
district
court
said
that
too.
they
both
said
they
were
ruling
against
liggett
on
the
facts,
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
here
even
viewing
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
liggett.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
clearly
not,
justice
o'connor.
it...
the
fourth
circuit
clearly
left
open
the
possibility
that
you
could
have
primary-line
violation
without
a
conspiracy
or
a
monopoly.
indeed,
it
recognized
utah
pie.
now,
utah
pie
is
a
case
where
there
was
no
conspiracy
alleged,
there
was
no
monopoly,
so
that
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
section
2(a)
does
not
make
it
merely
redundant
under
the
sherman
act.
but
i
wanted
to
get
onto
the
theories
of
injury
from
price
discrimination
here.
i
think
professor
areeda
said
that
using
price
discrimination
facilitates
predation
because
the
predator
doesn't
have
to
spend
as
much
money.
it
is
also
true
that
the
alleged
victim
doesn't
have
to
spend
as
much
money,
so
the
price
discrimination
facilitates
resistance
to
predation
in
the
same
amounts
as
it
facilitates
the
predation.
there
is
simply
no
injury
here
from
price
discrimination.
but
this
case,
i
think
it
is
profitable
to
compare
it
to
matsushita
because
this
case,
our
case,
brown
&
williamson's
case,
satisfies
both
the
majority
rationale
in
that
case
and
the
dissent's
rationale.
the
economic
theory
here
is
utterly
implausible
and,
in
addition,
the
facts
refute
it.
unlike
matsushita,
there
was
here
no
expert
witness
talking
from
facts
of
record.
the
expert
witness
here
was
an
advocate.
he
stated
the
facts
sometimes
in
contradiction
to
liggett's
executives,
and
he...
the
facts
he
assumed
have
no
basis
in
this
record.
also
unlike
matsushita,
this
is
not
a
summary
judgment
case.
the
district
court
here
let
this
case
go
to
trial,
heard
all
of
the
evidence,
reread
it
for
5
months,
and
then
wrote
a
very
thoughtful
j.n.o.v.
opinion.
so
that
i
think
primarily
both
courts
below
rested
upon
factual
determinations
that
there's
simply,
even
favorably
viewed
to
liggett,
no
substantial
evidence
to
back
up
their
case.
and,
indeed,
there's
not.
if
you
take
a
look--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--no,
the
trial
judge
did
not
think
he
erred
in
instructing
the
jury.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
not
a
theory
of...
that's
a
theory
of
how
you
read
the
instructions,
a
disagreement
about
how
you
read
the
instructions,
but
i
don't
think
those
instructions,
16,
18,
and
29,
can
be
read
any
other
way
than
that
the
jury
can
find
b&w
liable
for
bad
intent
alone.
and,
indeed,
liggett
says
that's
not
adequate,
bad
intent
alone
is
not
adequate.
they
did
say
that
was
adequate
at
the
trial
level;
at
the
appellate
level
they
don't
say
it's
adequate.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
possibility
of
reading
those
instructions
in
any
other
way.
now,
this
is
a
powerful
tale
that
liggett
tells
in
its
brief,
but
it
is
just
that,
it's
a
tale.
and
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
final
proposal...
that
is
liggett
put
in
evidence
the
document
that
destroys
its
own
case...
you
will
not
find
before
the
final
proposal
any
plan
to
do
all
the
things
liggett
says
b&w
planned
to
do.
it's
expressed
nowhere.
in
the
final
proposal
itself,
which
is
at
appendix
127,
every
one
of
liggett's
claims
about
our
plans
is
contradicted,
and
this
is
the
last
planning
document
there
is
before
we
went
in.
for
example,
liggett
says
we
were
going
to
save
$350
million
of
lost
branded
profits
by
attacking
them
in
generics.
if
you'll
look
at
the
final
proposal,
brown
&
williamson
is
saying
that
it's
going
to
lose
$350
million
to
generics,
without
relation
to
anything
that
it
does.
and
it
proposes
entering
generics
not
to
discipline
liggett,
there's
not
a
word
of
that...
entering
generics
to
make
some
profits
in
generics
to
replace
some
of
the
profits
it's
losing
on
brandeds.
now,
the
proposal
also
states
that
given
rjr's
repricing
of
doral
as
a
generic...
and
rjr,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
industry
giants...
there
is
no
reason
for
b&w
to
be
concerned
about
expanding
the
generic...
generic
segment.
the
segment
is
going
to
expand.
it
also
states
in
that
proposal
that
rjr
has
shown
its
willingness
to
accept
low
doral
prices
indefinitely,
which
is
hardly
a
sign
that
they
expect
somebody
to
manage
prices
up.
they
said
the
economy
or
generic
segment
of
the
market
is
established
and
will
be
a
major
part
of
the
market.
the
proposal
assumes
that
the
current
percentage
gap
between
generic
and
full
price
cigarette
prices
is
at
35
percent
and
will
continue
throughout
the
5-year
planning
period.
it
assumes...
it
speculates
as
to
what
other
companies
will
do,
and
they
will
have
differing
responses.
there
is
some
speculation
that
some
of
them
might
try
to
manage
prices
up.
that's
the
ordinary
thing,
you
try
to
think
about
your
competitors
and
what
they
might
do.
but
the
document
recognized
that
rjr
was
willing
to
accept
low
prices
on
doral
indefinitely
and
predicted
that
the
35
percent
price
gap
would
continue.
so
when
that
document,
which
is
the
crucial
document
in
this
case...
and
which
the
fourth
circuit
emphasized
because,
as
the
fourth
circuit
said,
liggett
heavily
relied
upon
this
document.
but
there's
no
mention
of
disciplining
liggett,
there's
no
mention
of
pricing
below
cost.
and,
indeed,
every
document
you
look
at
that
mentions
cost,
including
this
one,
explicitly
states
that
brown
&
williamson
will
not
go
below
cost.
there's
no
mention
of
signalling
to
others
for
narrowing
a
price
gap
or
slowing
the
growth
of
generics
or
recouping
any
losses
on
generics
from
branded
prices.
now,
liggett
subpoenaed
the
executives
and
the
documents
of
phillip
morris
and
rjr.
and
in...
nowhere
in
that,
in
those
documents
or
in
their
testimony,
was
there
nay
indication
that
they
thought
they
were
getting
any
kind
of
a
signal
from
liggett...
from
brown
&
williamson.
and
they
both
said
that
they
offered
volume
rebates
because...
as
brown
&
williamson
did...
because
liggett
and
rjr
offered
volume
rebates,
which
were
necessary
in
the
market.
now,
there
can
be
no
doubt,
and
i
think
this
fact
kills...
alone
kills
liggett's
case.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
brown
&
williamson
intended
to
expand
the
generic
segment
when
it
entered
it,
because
it
is
undisputed
that
brown
&
williamson
offered
black-and-white
cigarettes
to
1,000
wholesalers
who
had
never
carried
them
before.
and
that
sure
is
not
a
way
to
contain
the
growth
of
a
segment.
that's
a
fact
and
no
amount
of
theorizing
can
change
it.
there's
also
no
doubt
that
brown
&
williamson
did
not
intend
to
price
below
cost.
when
brown
&
williamson
went
in,
liggett
concedes
that
its
first
rebate
offer
was
above
cost.
after
that,
every
rebate
increase
was
initiated
by
liggett.
a
predator
doesn't
go
in
with
prices
above
cost.
and
it's
also
undisputed
that
every
time
a
new
rebate...
every
time
liggett
started
a
new
rebate,
brown
&
williamson's
financial
officer
calculated
that
brown
&
williamson
could
raise
its
rebates
and
still
make
profit,
because
it
had
been
instructed
by
its
parent
to
make
a
profit
on
sales.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
clearly
wasn't,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
are
the
assertions
of
william
burnett,
the
plaintiff's
economist,
and
those
assertions
are
about
facts,
they
do
not
rest
on
any
record
facts.
for
example,
we've
touched
upon
this
before,
liggett's
executives
said
at
their
depositions
that
there
was
no
tacit
collusion,
no
supracompetitive
prices
and
profits,
and
so
forth.
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
that
basis.
they
filed
affidavits
saying
they
didn't
understand
what
those
terms
meant
and
they
shouldn't
be
held
to
it.
the
judge
let
the
case
go
to
trial.
at
trial
they
came
back...
after
having
conferred
with
the
economists,
they
came
back
once
more
and
said
no
oligopolistic
interdependence,
no
tacit
collusion,
no
supracompetitive
prices
and
profits.
now,
that's
not
because
businessmen
talk
differently
than
economists.
they'd
been
talking
to
an
economist.
but
those
are
not
just
fact
witnesses
who
are
intimately
familiar
with
pricing.
those
are
the
officers
of
liggett.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
justice
stevens,
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
a
complete
defense.
they
said...
liggett's
theory,
which
is
a
very
complicated
careen-shot
theory,
is
that
brown
&
williamson
could
price
below
cost
in
generics
because
they
would
stop
the
transfer
of
smokers
from
branded
to
generics,
or
slow
it
down,
and
they
could
recoup
their
losses
that
way.
now,
they
said,
it
was
their
fact
statement,
that
they...
in
order
to
recoup
their
losses
there
had
to
be
supracompetitive
profits
and
prices
in
brandeds.
if
that's
not
there,
then
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
of
recoupment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don't
know...
i
don't--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--no,
the
theory,
justice
stevens,
was
that
they
were
there
already
and
brown
&
williamson
could
count
on
those
supracompetitive
profits
being
there.
and
these
liggett
executives...
and
not
just
fact
witnesses
when
they
denied
it,
these
are
the
people
who
were
authorized
by
law
to
bind
the
company,
and
they
come
in
and
say
an
essential
element
of
our
case
is
missing
and
we
want
triple
damages.
but
that's
true
throughout
this,
this
case.
their--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
don't
think
they...
i
think
they
had
a
better
notion
than
he
did.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
know,
one
of
the
reasons,
your
honor,
why
profits
are...
look
large
in
this
industry
is
twofold.
there
are
accounting
problems,
as
liggett
admits.
one
is
the
most
valuable
assets
these
companies
have
are
not
on
the
books,
and
that's
their
tradenames,
trademarks.
and
accounting
records
don't
allow
you
to
put
them
in
the
books.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
the
other--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--all
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
said...
he
said
two
things,
profits
are
abnormally
high
and
it
was
due
to
tacit
collusion
or
oligopolistic
interdependence.
the
management
denied
both
of
those
things.
and
i
don't
see
how
a
company
can
come
in...
it's
not
a
question
of
who
you
believe.
i
don't
see
how
a
company
can
come
in...
the
client
itself
can
walk
in
and
deny
its
own
case,
and
then
the
lawyers
say
yes,
but
i
have
an
economist
over
here
that
will...
who
will
contradict.
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
but
in
addition
to
that,
quite
aside
from
that--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that
might
be
a
virtue
on
their
part.
anyway,
we
have
this
utter
absence
of
a
prediction,
utter
absence
of
a
plan.
now,
liggett
gets
its
only
chance
to
say
that
brown
&
williamson's
corporate
policy
was
brown
&
williamson's...
they
stated
that
by
citing
seven
times
one
document,
which
is
at
joint
appendix
61,
and
that
document
which
liggett,
in
the
joint
appendix,
has
wrongfully...
has
wrongly,
wrongfully
i
didn't
mean...
wrongly
identified
as
by
mr.
olges,
is,
in
fact,
as
they
now
say,
by
a
ms.
tharaldson,
in
rough,
handwritten
notes.
and
she
says
in
there,
in
one
phrase,
about...
something
about
putting
a
lid
on
liggett,
and
also
possibly
signalling
competition.
ms.
tharaldson
was
in
a
sales
hierarchy
which
has
nine
tiers.
she
was
in
the
seventh
tier,
two
from
the
bottom.
and
there
is
no
evidence
anywhere
that
anybody
else
in
the
corporation,
certainly
not
an
officer
in
charge,
ever
saw
those
notes,
and
certainly
not
that
they
ever
adopted
those
notes
as
corporate
policy.
moreover,
those
notes
actually
support
brown
&
williamson,
and
not
liggett,
because
twice
in
there,
at
joint
appendix
68
and
74,
she
says
that
brown
&
williamson
will
not
price
below
cost
even
if
liggett
does.
so
whatever
putting
a
lid
of
liggett
might
mean,
it
didn't
mean
pricing
below
cost.
so
there's--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--somebody
else
will...
somebody
will
go
into
the
market.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
agree
with
you.
particularly,
why
should
the
smallest
company.
but
there's
one
other
point
i
really
want
to
get
to,
and
that's
this
point
about
raising
prices
and
narrowing
the
gap.
and
i
really
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
joint
appendix
325.
it's
a
chart...
it
is
liggett's
chart,
and
it
shows
prices
from
may
1980
to
1989,
june,
and
the
gap
between
generics
and
brandeds.
now--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--this
is
joint
appendix
325,
volume
ii.
this
is
liggett's
chart.
and
liggett
has
been
saying
that
in
december
1983
the
gap
stood
at
40...
or
almost
41
percent,
and
it
came
down
to
just
about
27
percent
by
june
of
'89.
if
you
look
at
the
chart,
they
have
chosen
the
two
most
extreme
figures
there
are.
and
if
you
come
along,
start
from...
in
may
1980,
the
top
left,
when
liggett
was
alone
in
the
field
the
gap
was
29.9,
it
dropped
about
a
point
in
november
and
then
it
began
rising.
so
the
gap
rose
and
it
stayed
above...
it
stayed
above
where
it
was
in
1980
up
until
june
of
1989.
so
if
we
were
narrowing
the
gap,
we
did
a
very
poor
job
of
it.
we
didn't
narrow
the
gap.
also,
notice
the
prices
there.
liggett
was
raising
prices
steadily
from
the
beginning
of
the
generics,
from
1980,
up
through
the
period
when
we
entered.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
commenced
as
soon
as
we
announced
we
were
going
to
go
into
generics.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
july,
'84.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
and
there's
one
other
thing
about
this
chart.
liggett
has
compared
only
its
black-and-whites
with
generic...
with
brandeds.
philip
morris
and
rjr
were
selling
black-and-whites
by
the
time
of
the
trial
at
over
50
percent
off
the
price
of
brandeds,
some
narrowing
of
the
gap.
moreover,
liggett
doesn't
mention
that
it
was
selling
a
branded
generic,
pyramid,
at
50
percent
off
the
price
of
brandeds.
so
there
was
no
plan
to
narrow
the
gap
and
there
was
no
narrowing
of
the
gap.
the
gap
fluctuated.
that's
about
all
i
can
say,
your
honors.
the
fact
is
the
district
court
specifically
found,
at
page
36a
of
the
petition,
"no
substantial
record
evidence
supports
burnett's
alignment
of
interest
theory.
"
that's
the
oligopolistic
theory.
"even
before
b&w
began
selling
black-and-white
cigarettes,
rjr
had
entered
the
generic
segment
by
repositioning
doral
at
generic
prices.
"
"burnett
conceded
that
rjr
had
no
anticompetitive
intent
and
that
doral's
entry
expanded
the
generic
segment.
"
the
court
noted
that
they
tried
to
sell
a
lot
of
cigarettes
to
replace
philip
morris
as
number
one.
furthermore,
the
court
said
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
of
the
other
major
cigarette
companies
had
an
interest
in
slowing
the
growth
of
generics.
then
five
of
the
six
companies
sold
generics,
today
all
six
do.
we
started
with
2.8
billion
cigarettes
being
sold
in
generics,
that
jumped
to
80
billion,
and
today
it's
about
twice
that.
so
there's
been
no
slowing
of
the
growth
of
generics,
but
rather
quite
the
contrary.
this
is
a
lawsuit
by
one
full-line
competitor
against
another
full-line
competitor,
both
of
whom
were
profitable
throughout
the
period
of
predation.
and
i
think
the
only
inference
one
can
draw,
after
looking
at
the
facts
and
seeing
that
there
was
no
plan
to
do
what
liggett
accuses
us
of
and
that
no
such
things
happened
in
the
market,
is
that
this
was
a
lawsuit
designed
initially
just
to
keep
brown
&
williamson
out
of
black-and-white
cigarettes.
you
have
to
be
very
careful
with
a
lawsuit
like
this,
because
there's
potential
for--
