justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
preliminary
question?
was
there
anything
in
this
case,
or
any
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
secondary-line
injury
to
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
proof,
for
example,
that
the
wholesalers
were
injured?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
never
a
suggestion
that
the
discrimination
would
be
unlawful
if
that
kind
of
injury
to
competition
ensued,
and
then
the
next
question
is
was
your
client
damaged
by
the
illegal
discrimination.
they
didn't...
nobody
argued
the
case
in
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
a...
if
a
food
chain,
for
example,
discriminated
between
a
chain
store
and
an
individual
small,
and
by
that
means
got
a
large
account
away
from
a
competing
supplier,
that
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
would
be
no
action
in
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
that
would
not
be
the
injury
to
competition.
the
injury
to
competition
makes
the
statute...
would
cause
a
statutory
violation
to
occur,
and
then
the
statutory
violation
might
injure
a...
but,
anyway,
that
theory
isn't
even
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
a
question,
if
i
may.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
know
what
the
issues
are
in
the
case.
i
gather
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden
of
establishing
three
things...
price
discrimination,
after
proving
price
discrimination.
one,
injury
to
competition
to
violate
the
statute;
two,
injury
to
itself--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
fact
of
damage.
and
three,
that
that
damage
was
so-called
antitrust
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
of
those
three
issues
are
in
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
there
was
an
injury
to
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bork,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question
here?
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
on
the
same
wavelength.
those
would
show,
i
gather,
no
actual
injury
to
competition.
but
i
gather
the
statutory
test
isn't
actual
injury,
but
a
probability
or
reasonable
possibility,
i
don't
know
what...
how
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
here.
so
the
mere
fact
that
the
actual
injury
didn't
develop
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
complete
defense,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
there
was
a...
a
reasonable
possibility
of
such
supracompetitive
profits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
there
wasn't,
i
don't
know,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there...
the
proof
that
there
was...
in
fact,
they
didn't
develop.
is
that...
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
complete
defense
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the...
your
point
about
the
expert
is
the
expert
said,
based
on
his
analysis
of
the
market,
the
profits
were,
in
fact,
supracompetitive,
even
though
the
executives
didn't
realize
it.
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
i
mean,
that
is
what
it
boils
down
to,
i
gather,
that...
that
they
thought
the
profits
were
perfectly
normal
and
the
economist
thought
they
were
abnormal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
be
sure
i
get
an
answer
to
my
question
before
i
get
lost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
hard
to
keep...
is
it
correct
that
what
you're
saying
to
us
is
that
the
management
people
said
the
profits
were
perfectly
routine
and
the
expert
said
that
they
were
abnormal,
abnormally
high,
and
because
the
expert
and
the
management
disagreed
we
must
agree
with
management?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
they
hadn't
read
chamberlain's
book.
[laughter]
