argument
next
in
no.
92-466,
brooke...
brooke
group
limited
v.
brown
&
williamson
tobacco
corporation.
mr.
areeda,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
predatory
price
violation
was
discrimination
among
its
wholesalers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
brown
&
williamson
wholesalers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how...
did
it
find
how
that
hurt
those...
that
discrimination
hurt
your
clients?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
had
wholesalers
doing
business
both
with
brown
&
williamson
and
with
liggett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said
in
answer
to
my
question,
mr.
areeda,
that
it
did
have
an
effect
on
your
client
because
your
client
had
to
change
its
procedures
in
order
to
continue
to
retain
the
business
of
the
wholesaler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
what
exactly
are
the
losses
that
liggett
is
suggest...
subjected
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
because
the...
is
it
because
brown
&
williamson
discriminated
among
its
wholesalers
that
liggett
has
to
do
that,
or
because
brown
&
williams
was
selling
below
cost?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
areeda.
mr.
bork,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bork,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
didn't
reverse...
it
didn't
uphold
the
directed
verdict
or
judgment
on
the
basis
of
bad
instructions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bork,
i
gather
from
your
argument,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
your
argument,
that
you
see
this
as
primarily
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case.
was
there
enough
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff,
liggett,
to
go
to
the
jury?
and
you're
saying
there
wasn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bork.
mr.
areeda,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
areeda,
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
mr.
bork's
answer
to
my
question,
that
this
seems
to
be
mostly
just
an
argument
about
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
areeda.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
