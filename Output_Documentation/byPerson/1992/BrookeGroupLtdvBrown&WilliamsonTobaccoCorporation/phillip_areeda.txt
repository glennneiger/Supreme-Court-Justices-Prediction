mr.
phillip
areeda
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
jury
in
this
case
found
predatory
price
discrimination
by
respondent
brown
&
williamson,
in
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
and--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--yes,
your
honor.
the
form
of
the...
the
form
of
the
discrimination
was
in
rebates
to
wholesalers
designed
not
to
be
passed
on
to
consumers.
mr.
phillip
areeda
brown
&
williamson
wholesalers.
in
fact,
the
wholesalers
were
not
brand
specific,
but
to
wholesalers
with
whom
it...
to
whom
it
sold,
yes.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes,
your
honor.
the...
this
discrimination
resulted
in
net
prices
to
b&w
that
were
below
its
average
variable
cost.
these
prices
below
average
variable
cost,
these
rebates,
had
to
be
met
by
liggett
in
order
to
retain
the
patronage
of
the
wholesalers
on
whom
it
depended.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
areeda
no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
instructions--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--that's
the
argument
of
the
other
side.
the
instructions,
fairly
read,
did
require
the
jury
to
find
that
b&w
engaged
in
below-cost
pricing
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
recoupment
before
it
could
find
that
there
was
the
injury
to
competition
that
it
did
find.
furthermore,
b...
the
b&w
experts
in
court
admitted
that
the
pricing
was
below
average
variable
cost.
to
be
sure,
they
sought
to
draw
the
string
from
that
admission
by
introducing
alleged
tax
savings,
but
there's
no
evidence...
the
brief
of
the
other
side
cites
no
evidence
at
all
of
any
realized
tax
savings.
so--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
we
accept
the
burden
of
showing
that
prices
were
discriminatory,
below
average
variable
cost,
and
were
undertaken
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
recoupment.
mr.
phillip
areeda
a
scheme...
the
rebates
were
based
on
volume.
and
a
volume
rebate,
for
example
75,
80
cents
a
carton,
for
wholesalers
who
handle
1,500
cases
during
some
period.
mr.
phillip
areeda
and
lesser
rebates
to
other...
to
wholesalers
who
did
not
handle
that
volume.
mr.
phillip
areeda
now,
these
are
discriminatory
volume
rebates.
mr.
phillip
areeda
the
discrimination
triggers
the
statute.
the
statute
only
applies
in
the
case
of
price
discrimination.
the...
there
is
admitted
price
discrimination,
and
therefore
the
statute
is
triggered.
now,
what
is
the
connection
between
such
discrimination
and
my
client?
such
discrimination
makes
predation
cheaper.
that
is,
if
you
offer
your
below-cost
prices
to
some
of
your
customers
and
you
charge
other
customers
higher
prices,
though
still
below
cost,
the
overall
burden,
the
financial
burden
on
the
predator,
is
diminished,
making
predation...
thereby
facilitating
predation.
that
is
why
the
statute
covers
discrimination
of
this
kind,
and
that
is
what
the
jury
found
here
as
well,
that
the
discrimination
facilitated
the
predation.
mr.
phillip
areeda
but--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--my
client
is
not
being
discriminated...
the...
in
primary
line...
allow
me
to
back
up,
your
honor.
the
robinson-patman
act
covers
so-called
primary
line
price
discrimination
and
secondary
line
price
discrimination.
the
kind
of
price
discrimination
which
you
have
focused
on,
justice
scalia,
is
the
secondary
line
price
discrimination
that
has
the
impact
of
harming
the
disfavored
buyer,
the
disfavored
wholesaler.
primary
line
price
discrimination,
that
price
discrimination
which
has
an
impact
on
competitors
in
the
market,
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
price
discrimination
never
has
an
impact
on
competitors
directly.
it
has
an
impact
on
competitors
only
because
it
can
facilitate
predatory
pricing,
and
that
is
what...
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
phillip
areeda
exactly,
exactly.
it
has...
the...
it's...
the
discrimination
and
the
below-cost
pricing
force
the
client.
the
client,
of
course,
doesn't
pay
or
receive...
doesn't
pay
the
discriminatory
prices,
he
reacts
to
them
just
exactly
as
you've
described.
and
that
reaction
subjects
liggett
to
severe
losses
which,
as
b&w
predicted
persistently
in
its
documents,
would
induce
liggett
to
raise
its
list
prices,
designed...
which
has
the
effect
of
raising
consumer
prices.
the
consequence
of
this--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--when
it
has
to
match
the
below-cost...
when
it
has
to
match
the
rebates
the...
of
the
defendant,
of
the
respondent,
which
are
below
cost.
to
match
those
below-cost
rebates
forces
it
to
bear
losses.
mr.
phillip
areeda
both.
it's...
the
sales
below
cost
are
what
directly
causes
the
losses
to
the
competitor,
to
the
rival.
it
is
the
discrimination
that
facilitates
the
sales
below
cost.
the
statute
is
triggered
by
the
discrimination.
it
is
the
below-cost
pricing
that
hurts
rivals.
it
is
always
the
below-cost
pricing
that
hurts
rivals.
mr.
phillip
areeda
that...
that
might
be.
that
might
be
the
consequence.
but
the
reason
that
it
facilitates,
the
reason
it
facilitates
is
that
it
makes
the
expenditure
on
predation
less.
now,
it's
true...
it
is
true,
your
honor,
that
if
all...
if
prices
were
lowered
uniformly,
the
burden
on
the
rival
could
be
greater,
which
is
what
you...
which
is
what
you've
focused
on.
but
at
the
same
time,
it's
also
true
that
by
not
having
to
extend
the
lowest
prices
to
all
of
your
customers,
the
predator
expends
less
on
his
predatory
program.
mr.
phillip
areeda
the
answer
to
your...
the
answer
to
your
questions
are
respectively
yes
and
no.
i'll
explain.
[laughter]
to
your
two
questions
are
yes
and
no.
first,
the
difference
between
the
two
statutes
is
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
require
any
price
discrimination.
a
second
difference
between
the
two
statutes,
which
gives
the
answer
to
your
second
question,
is
that
the
sherman
act
as
conventionally
required...
interpreted,
requires
single-firm
monopoly.
and
we
do
not
contend
that
there's
a
single-firm
monopoly
in
this...
in
this
case.
what
is
in
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--was--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--that...
no
one
has
litigated
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
phillip
areeda
the...
no
one
answered...
argued
the
case
on
that
basis,
but
let
me
answer
your...
let
me
answer
your
question.
if
the
only
injury
in
a
case
were
secondary
line...
were
secondary-line
injury,
then,
no,
i
would
not
think
a
competitor
of...
of
the
discriminator
would
be
entitled
to
sue.
mr.
phillip
areeda
no.
mr.
phillip
areeda
we
would
not
contend...
i
do
not
contend
that
that
is
an
offense.
i
do
not
contend
in
any
way
that
the
competitors
injury
here
was
the
injury
to
competition
in
the
primary
line.
it
was
derivative
from--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--that's
not...
that's
not
here.
mr.
phillip
areeda
what
is
here
is
that
the
losses,
as
b&w
predicted,
induced
liggett
to
raise
its
consumer
prices,
its
list
prices.
the
result
there
was
to
narrow
the
gap
between
regular
brand...
the
regular
brand
product
and
the
generic
product.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes,
your
honor.
we
do...
we
do
accept
that
burden.
mr.
phillip
areeda
we
do
believe,
and
we
have
proposed,
in
fact,
as
the...
as
the
rule
in
this
case
in
our
brief,
that
a
reasonable
prospect
of
recoupment
should
be
required
as
a
means
of...
as
a
means
of
reinforcing...
making
the
court
feel
more
comfortable
that
predation
is
actually
taking
place.
mr.
phillip
areeda
utah
pie
did
not
reach
that
issue.
mr.
phillip
areeda
utah
pie
came
early
in
the
thinking
about
predatory
pricing
and
did
not
reach
the
issue
as
to
whether
recoupment
would
be
required.
mr.
phillip
areeda
the
respondent
suggests
that
he
agrees
with
our
position,
that...
that
predation
oligopoly
is
possible,
but
all
of
the
arguments
in
the
respondent's
brief
are
that
is
it
impossible.
and
the
lower
court,
the
fourth
circuit,
upset
the
jury
verdict
not
on
the
basis
of
reviewing
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
on
the
grounds
that
a
mere
12
percent
firm...
a
mere
oligopolist
could
not
believe
that
recoupment
was
economically
rational.
and
i'd
like...
what
i'd
like
to
put
before
you
is
that
recoupment
is
economically
rational
in
the
circumstances
of...
of
this
case.
recoupment...
that
is
recoupment
and
success
in
predation
are
really
the
same
thing.
success
is
what
hurts
the
consumers.
success
also
brings
about
the
payoff
to
the
predator.
now,
recoupment
and
success
is
possible
whenever
predation
can
bring
about
or
achieve
supracompetitive
prices.
in
this
market
it's
quite
well
established
that
prices
are
supracompetitive.
and
the
maintenance
of
those
supracompetitive
prices
on
regular-brand
product
was,
in
fact,
the
object
of
the
predatory
scheme.
mr.
phillip
areeda
i
know,
your
honor--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--your
honor,
the...
competitive,
when
used
by
businessmen,
means
lots
of
rivalry.
competitive
when
used
by
economists
and
judges
means
that
the
market
tends
toward
competitive-level
prices.
in
this
market
what
the
plaintiff's
executives
testified
to
was
that
prices
were
fair
and
yes,
we're
not
engaged
in
conspiracy
with
anybody.
that
does
not
at
all
negate
the
textbook...
the
fact
that
this
industry
is
the
textbook
example
of
supracompetitive
prices.
and
the
textbooks
cited
by
both
sides,
such
as
the
scherer
book,
say
so.
it
is
the
classic
example
of
supracompetitive
prices
and
it
was
the
purposes...
it
was
the
purpose
and
effect
of
defendant's
conduct
to
protect
those
supracompetitive
prices
by
narrowing
that
discount.
and
the
result
of
what
it
did,
the
result
of
what
defendant
did,
was
not
only
was
the
gap
narrowed,
but
from...
but
prices
rose,
all
prices
rose,
regular
brands
and
the
generic
product.
prices--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--it's
a
matter
of
arithmetic,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
sufficient
payoff
for...
from
the
predatory
pricing
to
the
actor,
to
the
predator.
where
the
12
percent
firm
will
get
12
percent
of
the
benefit,
to
so
speak,
of
holding
regular
brand
prices
up,
a
smaller
firm
will
receive
a
smaller
benefit.
at
some
point
the
benefit
would
be
so
small
as
to
make
undertaking
the
risk
of
predation
too
great.
but
in
this
case
the
12
percent
firm
reaped
enough
and
it
expected
to
reap
enough
from
doing
this.
i'm
saying
that
prices
in
the
business,
prices
rose.
regular...
from
the
date
when
b&w
entered
the
black-and-white,
the
generic
business,
to
the
close...
to
the
close
of
the
record,
the
price
of
regular-brand
cigarettes
rose
67
percent.
the
price
of
generics,
including
the
subgenerics,
that
is
weighing
in
the
subgenerics
that
have
been...
that
have
been
mentioned...
the
price
of
all
generics
rose
74
percent.
that
demonstrates
the
narrowing
of
the
gap,
but
it
also
demonstrates
the
injury
to
consumers
and
the
success
of
the
project.
during
this
period...
regular
brand
prices
up
67
percent,
generic
prices
up
74
percent...
inflation
was
about
20
percent
cumulative,
costs
were
constant,
and
demand
was
falling.
mr.
phillip
areeda
it
did.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes.
yes,
it's
an
undisputed
fact
that
the
volume
of
generics
grew.
mr.
phillip
areeda
oh,
you
achieve
a
great
deal
if
you
could
raise
the
average
price.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes,
it
does.
and
if
you
take
the...
you
take
the
prices
that
appear
in
the
record
and
you
take
the
volume
numbers
that
appear
in
the
record
and
weigh
the
prices
by
the
volume
over
the
period,
you
find
that
the
average
price
rose
from
something
under
$26
in
this...
in
the...
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
to
something
over
$40...
that's
per
thousand.
mr.
phillip
areeda
--at
the...
at
the
end
of
this
period.
so
the
average
price
is
rising
considerably.
volume
greater
but
average
price
higher,
consumers
therefore
hurt.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes.
mr.
phillip
areeda
i...
i
beg
to
suggest
that
the
outcome
does
establish
the
confidence,
but
let
me
explain.
mr.
phillip
areeda
b&w
itself
predicted
that
its
fellow
oligopolists
would
be
likely
to
enter
the
discount
segment
of
the
business,
the
generic
sector
of
the
market.
b&w
predicted
that
in
advance
of
the
repositioning
of
doral,
if
you...
if
one
has
that
in
mind,
and
afterwards.
it
predicted
that
others
would
enter
the
market,
but
that
the
others
shared
b&w's
interest
in
narrowing
that
gap.
now,
this
isn't
clairvoyance
on
b&w's
part.
it's
a
recognition
of
the
objective
facts
of
the
market.
the
objective
fact
of
the
market
is
that
everybody
in
this
market
except
liggett
has
as
its
mainstay
the
high
price
regular
brands.
liggett
was
the
only
one...
it
was
the
maverick
in
the
market.
it
was
the
only
one
that
did
not
have
a
big
stake
in
regular
brands.
and
it's
on
that
account
that
b&w
predicted
with
confidence
that
the
others
would
enter
the
business.
and
once
they
got
in
the
business
would,
like
b&w,
seek
to
narrow
the
gap
to
manage
prices
and
profitability
upwards.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
the
generic
segment
grew
in
size
is,
i
suggest,
more
a
response
to
the
explosion
in
prices
that
came,
rather
than
anything
else.
it
is
that
explosion
in
prices
that
demonstrates
the
injury
to
consumers.
further,
during
the...
during
the
time
when
b&w
was
itself
engaged
in
these
escalating
rebates
in
early
'84,
doral,
a
so-called
branded
generic
by
reynolds,
was
in
the
market.
mr.
phillip
areeda
and
it
did
not
feel
obliged
to
lower
its
price
while
b&w
was
escalating
its
rebates,
and
did
not
feel
obliged
to
raise
its
own
rebates.
the
doral
rebates
were
something
like
16
cents
a
carton;
the
big
b&w
rebates
were
something
like
70
to
80
cents
a
carton.
r.j.
reynolds
did
not
feel
obliged
to
match
this
rebate
offered
by
b&w,
and
thus
well
understood...
must
well
have
understood
what
was
going
on.
during
the
period
of
these
below-cost
prices,
moreover,
regular
brand
prices
themselves
were
rising.
so
it
was
not
an
instance
in
which
because
of
b&w's
conduct
the
fellow
members
of
the
oligopolist
would
ruin
their
50
years
of
supracompetitive
pricing
by
starting
to
lower
their
regular-brand
prices.
they
didn't.
they
did
the
opposite;
they
continued
to
raise
regular-brand
prices
as
before,
and
after.
the
further
point
that
i'd
like
to
emphasize...
one
further
theoretical
point
that
i'd
like
to
reassure
you
about
is
that
b&w's
argument
is
that
a
12
percent
firm
cannot
subject
a
maverick
in
the
market
to
losses
without
the
cooperation
of
fellow
oligopolists.
in
some
market
circumstances
that
may
be
true;
it's
not
true
in
this
market
circumstance.
in
this
market
circumstance,
the...
the
upsetting
element
to
the
oligopoly
was
the
black-and-white
pricing,
was
the
generic
prices.
and
b&w,
acting
alone,
had
ample
capacity
to
bring
those
prices
down
below
average
variable
cost,
and
thereby
to
subject
liggett
to
the
pressures
that
disciplined
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
phillip
areeda
right.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes.
mr.
phillip
areeda
i
believe,
fairly
put
your
honor,
only
the
first
issue
is
in
dispute.
that
is
that
the...
the
respondent
disputes
the
injury--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--to
competition,
but
does
not
dispute
injury,
in
fact,
to
liggett.
or
at
least
we
may
hear
differently
in
a
few
minutes,
but
my
understanding
is
they
do
not
dispute
that,
in
fact.
and
while
they
argued
below
a
great
deal
about
antitrust
injury,
they
were
really
arguing
that
there
was
no
violation.
if...
let
me
put
the
antitrust
injury
question
to
rest.
if
there
is
a
violation...
the
reason
we
find
a
violation
is
because
there
is
injury
to
the
rival
which
will
ultimately
redound
to
the
injury
of
consumers.
i
mean
that's
why
we
have
a
rule
against
predatory
pricing.
so
if
there
is
a
violation,
then
the
plaintiff's
injury
flows
from
the
reason
for
finding
the
violation,
and
therefore
there
is
antitrust
injury.
the
principal
issue
in
the
case,
if
i
haven't
emphasized
it
enough,
is
that
there
was
a
jury
verdict
below.
and
much
of
the
factual
controversy
that
the
respondent's
devotes
its
brief
to
does
not
really
address
the
question.
because
even
if
you
think
there's
some
doubt
about
the
facts,
the
judgment,
notwithstanding
the
verdict
given
below,
cannot
be
affirmed
unless
no
properly
instructed
jury
could
find
pricing
below
cost
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
recoupment.
and
we
believe
that
every
properly
instructed
jury
not
only
could
but
should
find
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
phillip
areeda
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
notice
that--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--no,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
not
based
on
facts.
there
are
only
two
facts
mentioned
in
the
court
of...
relied
on,
really,
by
the
court
of
appeals.
one
was
the
12
percent
market
share
of
brown
&
williams,
on
which
the
court
built
its
theoretical
suspicions,
and
the
other
was
the
growth
of
the
generic
sector,
which
the
court
below
thought
confirmed
its
theoretical
suspicions.
i
observe
further
that
mr.
bork,
in
the
course
of
his
argument,
couldn't
resist
saying
the
theory
was
impossible,
as
well
as
arguing
that...
from
his
viewpoint,
that
the
facts
didn't
support
it.
indeed,
the
facts
for
this
court,
as
it
should
have
been
for
the
court
of
appeals,
ought
to
be
taken
as
in
the
form
consistent
with
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
phillip
areeda
i
read
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
white,
as
saying
that
only
a
monopolist
or
a
cartel
can
successfully
predate.
that
everybody
else
is
so
filled
with
uncertainty,
that
no
rational
person
would
do
what
b&w
did
in
this
case.
mr.
phillip
areeda
no.
the
district
judge
was
a
little
more
qualified,
your
honor.
the
district
judge
said
well
maybe...
maybe
it
could
be
detrimental
in
some
cases,
maybe
predation
could
succeed
in
some
cases,
but
it
couldn't
succeed
here
because,
using
the
same
argument
that
mr.
bork
used,
the
liggett
officials
testified
they
weren't
engaged
in
tacit
collusion.
mr.
phillip
areeda
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
court--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--the
court
there
has
none
of
the
apparatus...
the
answer
is
yes.
there
is
not...
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
there's
none
of
the
apparatus
of
factual
review.
indeed,
except
for
one
line
at
the
beginning
of
the
opinion
reporting
the
existence
of
a
jury
verdict,
one
would
never
know
there
had
been
one
as
one
reads
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
and
as
far
as
the
argument
as
to
what
the
jury
found
or
didn't
find,
the
question
is...
the
issue
is
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
can
only
be
supported
if
no
properly
instructed
jury
could
find
on
the
record.
and
what
we
ask...
what
we
ask
this
court
to
find
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
is
wrong
and
in
the
concrete
facts
of
this
case,
to
rule
that
a
jury
could
reasonably
find
a
reasonable
prospect
of...
of
recoupment.
justice--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--yes.
mr.
phillip
areeda
yes,
it
would
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
phillip
areeda
the
court...
the
court
of
appeals
would
then
have
to
examine
the
remaining
evidentiary
questions,
yes,
your
honor.
on...
justice
scalia,
you
asked
in
particular
a
question
of
judge
bork
that
i'd
like
to
respond
to.
you
asked
why
would
the
12
percent
firm
take
the
hit
of
engaging
in
predation.
and
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
the
b&w
documents.
the
b&w
documents
say
the
larger
firms,
philip
morris
and
reynolds,
are
unlikely
to
do
this
because
they
would
fear
antitrust
liability.
so--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--the
earlier
document...
a
few
pages
earlier
in
the
record,
the
b&w...
the
b&w
more
formal
documents
say
something
like
the
following.
b&w...
reynolds
and
philip
morris
are
likely
to
enter
especially
if
somebody
else
doesn't
constrain
the
growth
of
the
segment.
and
that
somebody
else,
of
course,
was...
was
b&w.
i'm
not
going
to
respond
to
all
of
the
factual
points
raised
by...
by
judge
bork,
because
they
are
covered
in...
they
are
covered
in
the
brief,
and
i
believe
adequately
responded
to.
the
one...
i
would
like
to
respond,
to
address
one
point
that
has
not
been
put
on
the
surface
today,
but
that
the
amici
have
urged
upon
this
court.
the
amici
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
fourth
circuit
decision
should
be
upheld
because
oligopolistic
predation
is,
at
best,
rare,
and
any
legal
rule
that
admits
the
possibility
of
it
will
end
up
chilling
price
competition.
i
think
that's
wrong,
that
position
is
wrong.
it's
wrong
because
no
one
knows
the
frequency
of
oligopolistic
predation.
secondly,
even
if
it's
rare,
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
monopoly
is
not
required
to
violate
this
statute,
and
the
statutory
text
does
not
authorize
immunity
for
the
oligopolistic
predator
who
gets
caught,
as
b&w
has
here.
thirdly,
as
with
monopolistic
predation...
monopolistic
predation
is
also
thought
often
to
be
rare,
yet
the
court
responds
to
that
supposed
infrequency
not--
mr.
phillip
areeda
--thank
you.
