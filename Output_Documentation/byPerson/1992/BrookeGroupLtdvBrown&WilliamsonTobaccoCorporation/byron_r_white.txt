mr.
bork,
are
you...
are
you
defending
the...
i
know
you're
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
are
you...
are
you
defending
their
rationale
for--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
are
you
defending
their
theory,
whatever
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-hum.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
thought...
but
what
did
they
concentrate
on,
on
the
factual,
that
there
couldn't
have
been
any
anticipation
of
recoupment?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
trial
judge
thought
that
he
had
erred
in
instructing
the
jury,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
think
that
you
do...
i
take
it
you...
you
think
the
instructions
were...
were
invalid
in
the
sense
that
they
would
permit
the
jury
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
that
the
law
didn't
permit.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
a...
quite
a
difference,
a
legal
difference
between
you
two
in
terms
of
the
validity
of
the
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
court
of
appeals...
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
much
different
from
the...
from
the
district
judge's
theory,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
not--
