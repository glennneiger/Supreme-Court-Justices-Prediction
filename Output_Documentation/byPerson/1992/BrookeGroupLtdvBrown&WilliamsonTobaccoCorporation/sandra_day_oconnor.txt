now,
mr.
areeda,
you...
you
agree
that
under
matsushita's
holding
that
essentially
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
hope
of
recoupment
of
the
loss?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra

o'connor
so
to
that
extent
utah
pie
is
not
to
the
contrary
or
it
is
limited
somehow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-hum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
tell
me
what
differences
you
have
with
the
respondent's
legal
theory
in
this
case.
does
it
boil
down
to
a
question
of
fact
for
us,
or
is
there
a
difference
in
legal
theory
between
you
and
the
respondent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bork,
do
you...
do
you
think
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct
when
it
said
that,
if
i
have
it
right,
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement
among
the
oligopolists,
which
nobody
contends
is
the
fact
here,
membership
alone
in
an
oligopoly
provides
no
basis
for
proof
of
illegal
conduct?
is
that...
is
that
accurate
or
is
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
the
fourth
circuit
thought
that
it
had
defined
a
conspiracy
or
a
monopoly?
