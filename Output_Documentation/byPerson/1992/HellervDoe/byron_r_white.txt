justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
participation?
didn't
it
provide
that
they
became
parties
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
permits
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
provision
was
held
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
made
several
claims
of
what
the
difference
between
the
two
groups
were,
and
they
were
all
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
still
stick
by
them
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
us
again
how
they
are
different
or
tell
us...
finally.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
a
reason
for
distinguishing
the
two
classes.
why...
what
justification
is
there
for
applying...
i
ask
you
again...
for
applying
one
standard
of
proof
to
one
group
and
another
standard
of
proof
to
another.
what
is
the
justification?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
standard
of
proof
for
involuntary
commitment?
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
if
you
win
this
case
on
the
standard
of
proof
issue,
that
i'm
not
sure
you've
won
very
much
because
that
will
give
the
state
the
option
of
either
raising
the
standard
of
proof
in
one
case
or
lowering
it
in
the
other.
and
i
can
guess
what
they're
going
to
do,
can't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
a
lot
of
states
have
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
the...
why
do
you
object
so
much
to
the
presence
of
the...
of
family
or
guardians
in
the
mentally
retarded
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
kind
of
participation
are
you
talking
about
that
is
so
significant?
do
they
become
parties
to
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
the
right
to
appeal
and
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when...
if
the
parents
are
available
in
the
mentally
retarded
case,
do
they
also
appoint
a
guardian?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you...
so,
if
the
parents
can't
become
parties,
other
than...
they
can't
do
anything
but
witnesses,
that
means
then
there
has
to
be
a
guardian
appointed.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
they
have
to
prove
for
an
involuntary
commitment,
that
he's
a
danger
to
him
or
herself
or
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
he
get
into
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
when
what
happens
does
he
get
into
the
act?
when
the
parents
ask
him
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
when?
when
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
how
does
the
county
attorney
even
know
about
this
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
any
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
person.
any
member
of
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
then
there
is
a
petition
filed
by
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
did
you
get
into
this
case?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
the...
oh,
you
filed
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
a
class
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
kentucky
applied
the
same
rule
about
the
presence
of
third
parties
to
the
mentally
ill.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
so,
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
you
would
say
also
i
suppose
that
it
violates
the
due
process
rights
of
the
mentally
ill.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
there's
a
lawyer
representing
the
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
lawyer
isn't
going
to
be...
i
suppose
if
he's
representing
his
or
her
client,
he
or
she
are
not
going
to
be
put
down
by
parents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
the
attorney
is
for
the
client.
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
--take
11
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
it
take
so
long?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
is
a
lawyer
appointed?
you
were
describing
the
procedure.
is
there
a
lawyer
appointed
for
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
state
pays
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
after
they...
when
does
it
ever
get
to
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
got
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
where
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
has
to
be
satisfied.
