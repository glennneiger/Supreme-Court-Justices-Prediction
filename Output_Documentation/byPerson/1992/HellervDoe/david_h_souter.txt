justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
moore,
your
argument...
if
i
understand
your
argument,
it
is
that
it
is
easier
to
make
an
accurate
and
sound
determination
of
mental
retardation
than
it
is
to
make
such
a
determination
about
mental
illness.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
then
is
that
an
argument
for
having
a
lower
standard
of
commitment?
i
mean,
you...
in
effect,
you've
said,
well,
it's
easier
to
meet
the
standard
of
commitment.
why
is
that
an
argument
for
having
a
lower
standard
of
commitment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
understand
that,
but
it's
still,
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
that
it
is
appropriate
to
have
a
lower
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
your--
--mr.--
--i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
no.
i
had
a
further
question.
and
your
authority
for
that
is
addington?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
addington
got
to
do
with
an
equal
protection
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
the...
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
you
have
a
difference
which
justifies
a
different
standard
for
valuing
human
liberty
and
valuing
the
justification
for
limiting
it,
and
i
don't
see
what
addington
has
to
do
with
that
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
kentucky
is
not
utilizing
it
for
mental
illness,
and
the
issue
here
is
whether
you
can
utilize
a
different
standard
on
an
issue
which
deprives
someone
of
liberty
depending
on
the
distinction
between
mental
illness
and
mental
retardation.
and
i
just
don't
see
the
connection.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
equal
protection
clause
seems
to
say
that
unless
you
can
justify
that,
either
by
a
rational
basis
standard,
perhaps
as
you
would
like
it,
or
by
a
standard
of
higher
scrutiny,
that
having
made
that
election,
you've
got
to
live
with
it
and
you've
got
to
apply
it
across
the
board.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
leads
to
a
bad
result
in
every
case
in
which
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
then,
doesn't
it?
isn't
that
what
equal
protection
means?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're...
it
seems
to
me
you're
now
making
a
different
argument.
i
thought
you
were
making
the
argument
that
by
giving
the
parents
the
right
to
appeal,
it
was
somehow
weighting
the
scales
in
favor
of
commitment.
you're
now
giving
an
argument
that
the
parents
really
do
not
have
an
interest
subject
to
being
recognized.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
first
one.
isn't
the
problem
not
how
many
parties
may
appeal,
but
what
the
standard
for
commitment
is?
and
if
the
standard
of
commitment
is
sufficiently
high...
and
we
will
leave
the
equal
protection
issue
aside
and
assume
it's
at
least
clear
and
convincing,
why
does
it
make
any
difference
and
why
should
it
be
cognizable
under
mathews
whether
you
have
two
potential
appellants
or
one
potential
appellant?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
thought
the
balance
was
reflected
in
the
burden
of
proof,
rather
than
the
number
of
parties
who
may
have
the
status
as
such.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
the
point
that
i
just
made?
why
isn't
the
so-called
balance
a
function
of
the
burden
of
proof?
isn't
that
what
mathews
was
getting
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
risk
and
the
risk
is
assessed
in
relationship
to
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
think
the
burden
of
proof
is
in
an
de
facto
sense
going
to
vary
depending
on
whether
only
the
county
attorney
can
appeal
or
the
parents
can
appeal?
how
does
that
affect
the
standard
of
proof?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
take...
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
take
the
position
that
even
if
the
burden
of
proof
for
those
mentally
retarded
were
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
there
still
would
be
a
due
process
problem
in
giving
the
parents
or
certain
family
members
party
status
with
the
right
to
appeal.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
how...
why
isn't
the
burden
of
proof
a
sufficient
answer
to
that,
that
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
sufficiently
high,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
one
person
is
appealing
or
another
person
is
appealing?
the
protection
for
the
liberty
interest
is
going
to
be
the
same
because
it's
going
to
be
a
function
of
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
david
h.
souter
should
we
treat
the
attorney
as,
in
effect,
as
a
guardian
ad
litem
since
there's
no
determination
made
in
the
first
instance,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
individual
is
confident
to
represent
himself.
is
the
attorney,
therefore,
in
effect,
functioning
as
a
guardian
ad
litem?
