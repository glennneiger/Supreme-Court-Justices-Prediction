beyond
the
age
of
majority.
you
have
to
continue
to
support
the
disabled
child
indefinitely.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
a
question
about...
while
we're
on
the
ability
to
appeal?
am
i
correct
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
category
of
relatives
that
are
permitted
to
appeal
from
the
preliminary
hearing
and
those
that
are
permitted
to
appeal
from
the
district
court
determination?
one
is
section
15
of
the
house
bill,
15(3),
which
is
on
page
128
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
that
says
guardians
and
immediate
family
members
shall
have
standing
to
appeal
any
adverse
decision.
and
then
section
22,
which
is
on
page
132,
says
appeal
from
the
final
orders
or
judgments
of
the
district
court.
it
says
that
appeals
may
be
taken
by
guardian,
limited
guardian,
or
other
authorized
representative.
that's
a
different
class,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
which
class
are
we
arguing
about
here?
both
or
either
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
does
kentucky
law
require
parents
to
support
the
mentally
ill
past
the
age
of
majority,
as
well
as
the
mentally
retarded,
or
just
the
mentally
retarded,
or
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
disabled.
and
would
you
interpret
that
to
cover
the
mentally
ill?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
would
cover
all
of
the
mentally
retarded
at
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moore,
why
do
you
insist
on
rejecting
the
distinction
that
justice
souter
suggested?
is
it
not
the
case
that
if
it
is
easier
to
tell
whether
someone
is
mentally
retarded...
he's
always
that
way.
he
always
needs
that
help.
whereas
the
person
who's
mentally...
what's
the
other?
mentally
ill?
mentally
ill
comes
in
and
out,
there's
less
chance
of
making
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
by
having
a
lower
burden
of
proof,
you're
not
as
likely
to
commit
very
many
people
who
really
aren't
mentally
retarded--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it's
a
lot
easier
to
tell.
how
about
that
as
a
justification
for
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
if
the
attorney
is
the
advocate
for
freedom,
sometimes
what's
better
for
the
individual
would
not
be
freedom,
but
commitment
i
assume.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
who's
advocating
the
commitment?
you
have
the
attorney
advocating
the
freedom.
the
parents
don't
agree
with
that.
the
parents
think
that
this
child
would
be
better
in
an
institution.
who's
advocating
the
other
side?
the
attorney
wins
below.
he
gets
freedom,
and
the
parents
say
this
attorney
is
wrong.
is
the
child
going
to
be
the
one
to
say,
no,
you're
wrong?
of
course
not,
because
the
child
is
incompetent.
is
that
fair?
justice
antonin
scalia
incompetent
adults.
incompetent
adults,
and
you're
saying
the
attorney...
it's
a
one-way
street.
the
attorney
who's
interested
in
freedom,
if
he
loses
freedom
below,
he
can
appeal.
he
can
appeal
the
commitment,
but
if
the
attorney
wins
freedom
below,
nobody
can
appeal
it
because
the
child,
of
course,
or
the
adult
is
incompetent.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
who
appeals
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
has
an
attorney
been
appointed
then?
why
has
an
attorney
been
appointed
if
the
person
is
not
incompetent?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
the
parents
select
the
attorney
or
the
incompetent
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
miller,
suppose
all
that
happens,
if
this
person
steps
in,
is
that
you
get
an
appeal.
what
would
be
wrong
with
a
state
system
that
says
we're
worried
about
too
many
people
who
are
really
mentally
incompetent
or
even
mentally
ill
being
allowed
out
on
the
street.
and,
therefore,
whenever
there's
a
trial
in
which
the
court
says
the
person
is
not
mentally
ill
or
not
mentally
incompetent,
any
citizen
can
ask
for
a
retrial
on
appeal?
would
that
deprive
anyone
of
due
process?
it
just
gives
you
another
court.
why
is
that
a
deprivation
of
due
process?
maybe
even
a
better
judge.
it
will
be
an
appellate
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
perfectly
good
if
there
were
no
double
jeopardy
clause,
it
seems
to
me,
to
say
that
whenever
a
criminal
is
acquitted,
a
member
of
the
public
who
believes
it
wasn't
a
just
verdict
can
ask
for
a
retrial.
if
it
weren't
for
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
that
would
be
fine,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
appointed
attorney
is
more
likely
to
have
the
interest
of
the
person
at
heart
than
the
parents?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
for
the
client.
you
told
us
he's
for
freedom.
freedom
may
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
client.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
proceeding,
to
decide
whether
that
is
in
the
interest
of
the
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
here
severe
mental
retardation.
we're
not
talking
about
just
mental
retardation.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
two
categories?
severe,
and
what
is
the
other
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
profound
and
severe
are
the
only
two
we're
talking
about
here.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
other
than
profound
and
severe
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
subtlety
or
nuance.
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
chance
of
commitment
if
the
person
is
not
a
danger
to
himself
and
there's
no
chance
of
his
being
a
danger
to
himself
if
he's
mildly
retarded.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
moore,
i
thought...
i
don't
know
where
i
got
the
impression.
i
thought
we
were
just
dealing
with
severely
and
profoundly
retarded.
that
is
not
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
a
devil's
advocate,
in
effect.
he
knows
one
side
of
the
case
to
be
on.
right?
