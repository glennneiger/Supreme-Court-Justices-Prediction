even
after
the
child
is
put
in

institution.

--mr.
moore,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
i
understood
you
earlier
to
say
you
wanted
us
to
reverse
the
judgment
insofar
as
it
requires
a
procedure
to
be
implemented
before
there
is
an
involuntary
commitment,
that
people
should...
the
guardian
should
be
able
to
just
voluntarily
commit
the
mentally
retarded.
but
is
that
issue
before
us
at
this
time?
i
thought
we
had
a
question
dealing
with
the
procedures
that
should
be
followed
in
an
involuntary
commitment
proceeding,
rather
than
when
should
there
be
an
involuntary
commitment
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
that
some
mentally
ill
people
can
be
committed
voluntarily,
but
that
isn't
true
of
mentally
retarded.
but
is
there
any
reason
for
having
a
different
procedure
for
those
mentally
ill
persons
who
are
being
committed
against
their
will,
involuntarily?
why
should
they
be
subject
to
a
different
standard
of
proof
than
the
mentally
retired...
retarded
who
are
being
involuntarily
committed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
my
questions
because
today
the
procedures
are
different,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
burden
of
proof
is
different
in
the
two.
and
the
question
i'm
asking
you
is
if
you
have
one
person
who's
being
involuntarily
committed
because
he's
mentally
retarded
and
another
one
because
he's
mentally
ill,
what
is
the
state's
reason
for
applying
different
standards
of
proof
in
those
two
cases.
isn't
that
the
issue
we're
called
upon
to
decide,
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
for
that
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you've
really
said
very
much
about
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
couldn't...
that
fact
could
have
been
brought
out
through
testimony
whether
the
parent
were
a
party
or
just
a
witness,
couldn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though
you're
saying
these
parents
can't
appear
and
testify.
you
wouldn't
say...
that's
not
loading
of
the
dice,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
also
possible
there
may
be
cases
cases
where
the
parents
would
sympathize
with
the
mentally
retarded
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
attorney
present
at
the
two
preliminary
hearings,
the
probable
cause
hearing
and
the
preliminary
hearing?
