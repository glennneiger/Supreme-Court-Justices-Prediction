we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-351,
leonard
heller
v.
samuel
doe.
mr.
moore,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
mean,
mr.
moore,
to
say
a
decision
to
place
the
children
from
a
facility
into
a
community
setting?
what...
describe
that
in
a
little
more
detail,
if
you
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
i
did
was
ask
you
to
explain
two
phrases
you
used
in
an
earlier
statement.
can
you
do
that
a
little
more
shortly
than
you're
doing
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
more
community
like
setting
is
where
they
would
have
more
freedom
than
they
have
in
the
so-called
facility?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
just
somehow
get
to
the
heart
of
your
case
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
anything
other
than
the
equal
protection
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
rely
on
any
statutory
basis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
provision
is
it
of
rule
24
that
you
think
authorizes
us
to
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
it's
not
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
moore,
several
members
of
the
court
have
asked
you
to
explain,
as
simply
as
you
can,
why
kentucky
justifies
one
standard
for
the
mentally
ill
and
another
for
the
mentally
retarded.
explain
to
us,
just
in
two
or
three
sentences,
why
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
moore.
ms.
miller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
reason
that
mr.
moore
gave
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
that
if,
in
fact,
it's
easier
to
make
a
diagnosis
of
the
mentally
retarded
than
it
is
of
the
mentally
ill,
that
justifies
a
difference
in
the
burden
of
proof
because
you're
less
likely
to
make
a
mistake
with
one
than
you
are
with
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
you
need
is
a
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
between
one
class
and
the
other.
the
fact
there
may
be
overlap,
the
fact
there
may
be
variations
within
the
class
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
equal
protection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
one
of
the
opinions
in
foucha?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
think
it
should
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
foucha?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
prosecutor
have
to
prosecute
every
single
petition
that's
filed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
does
not
have
a
right
to
say
there
are
just
not
sufficient
grounds
here.
i'm
not
going
to
push
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
are
your
clients
hurt
by
allowing...
by
kentucky
allowing
certain
parents
or
guardians
to
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
are
two
appellants
rather
than
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
hurt
your
client?
i
mean,
if
there's
going
to
be
some
sort
of
appeal,
how
does
it
hurt
to
have
two
people
saying
we
want
to
challenge
it
rather
than
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
this
was
an
equal
protection
argument
you
were
making.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what...
to
show
that
your
clients
are
some
way
injured
in
order
to
raise
either
the
due
process
or
the
equal
protection
claim,
how
are
they
hurt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
miller.
mr.
moore,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moore.
the
case
is
submitted.
