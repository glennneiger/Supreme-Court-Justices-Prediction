mr.
william
k.
moore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
civil
rights
action
brought
under
42
u.s.c.,
section
1983
by
respondents,
who
in
this
case
are
sammy
doe
and
the
class
that
he
represents,
to
challenge
the
procedures
utilized
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
for
admission
of
mentally
retarded
persons
to
the
residential
facilities
operated
by
the
state.
the
record
contains
more
than
10
years
of
history
of
the
state's
efforts
to
comply
with
the
requirements
established
by
the
courts
below
for
those
admissions
procedures.
at
the
time
the
litigation
began
all
admissions
to
the
state's
facilities
were
done
on
a
voluntary
basis.
the
applications
for
admission
were
made
by
the
local
community
health
centers
who
had
certified
to
the
state
that
there
were
no
less
restrictive
provisions
available
for
the
mentally
retarded
person.
there
was
nothing
that
was
available
for
them
in
the
community,
and
the
state
reviewed
those
applications
by
and
through
a...
what
they
call
a
records
review
committee,
which
was
a
group
of
qualified
mental
health
professionals
or
mental
retardation
professionals,
to
determine,
in
fact,
whether
or
not
the
individual
could
best
be
served
in
one
of
the
state's
facilities.
if
that
committee
determined
that
they
could
be
so
served
to
determine
which
facility
the
person
would
be
placed
in,
the
person
was
put
on
a
waiting
list,
and
when
a
space
became
available,
they
were
then
admitted
to
the
facility
on
the
application
or
signature
of
their
guardian.
the
guardian
provided
the
substituted
informed
consent
for
the
admission,
and
the
admission
was
treated
as
voluntary.
the
individual
then
had
the
right
to
be
released
at
any
time
upon
his
or
her
request
or
upon
the
request
of
the
guardian.
the
initial
decision
of
the
district
court
reviewed
those
procedures,
found
that
those
procedures
were
in
keeping
with
the
procedures
required
by
the
constitution
except
an
additional
procedure
that
the
state
had
informally
adopted
which
permitted
the
parents
of
mentally
retarded
children
to
essentially
veto
a
decision
or
recommendation
to
place
the
children
from
a
facility
into
a
community
setting.
upon
reconsideration--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--the
commonwealth's
services
for
the
mentally
retarded
are
operated
through
the
cabinet
for
human
resources.
it's
an
umbrella
agency.
it
has
a
division
called
the
division
of
institutional
care
which
operates
the
state's
residential
facilities.
there
are
four
of
those.
they
are
intermediate
care
facilities
for
the
mentally
retarded,
intermediate
care
being
the
medicaid
reference--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
residential
facilities,
there
are
also
community
facilities.
the
record
describes
that
the
community
facilities
were
also
developed
by
the
cabinet
for
human
resources,
under
contract
with
the
local
community
health
agencies,
to
provide
group
home
type
placements,
placements
in
what
they
call
alternate
living
units,
where
someone
could
live
outside
of
the
community...
or
outside
of
a
residential
facility
in
a
more
community
like
setting.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
an
issue
which
is
subject
to
debate,
your
honor.
for
many
of
the
people
that
are
subject
to
being
admitted
to
the
facility,
their
freedom
is...
the
idea
of
freedom
or
the
idea
of
liberty
is
very
limited.
for
some
of
those...
the
people
that
are
in
the
facilities,
virtually
any
four
walls
will
make
a
prison.
for
many
of
the
people,
they
have
no
liberty
like
the
people
that
are
at
hazelwood
who
have
no
ability
to
move.
they're
nonambulatory.
many
of
them
are
deaf,
blind.
they're
mostly
severely
and
profoundly
retarded.
so,
the
matter
of
where
they
are
placed
as
being
more
or
less
restricted
is
in
some
sense
debatable,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
if
your
honor
please,
based
upon
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts,
the
kentucky
legislature
adopted
a
whole
new
set
of
procedures
for
the
mentally
retarded.
after
holding
lengthy
hearings
concerning
what
the
needs
of
that
group
of
people
were,
they
adopted
what's
called
house
bill
511,
and
it's
printed
in
the
appendix
in
this
matter.
that
new
statute
was
challenged.
two
parts
of
it
were
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
one
dealing
with
the
standard
of
proof,
which
would
be
required
for
the
involuntary
commitment
of
mentally
retarded
persons
to
the
state's
facilities;
the
other
provisions
dealing
with
the
participation
in
the
involuntary
commitment
proceedings
of
the
parents,
guardians,
and
immediate
family
members
of
the
mentally
retarded.
mr.
william
k.
moore
it
permits
them
to
become
parties,
your
honor.
it
does
not
require
that
they
do
so.
mr.
william
k.
moore
permits
them--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--it
was
held
to
be
both,
your
honor,
denial
of
both.
yes,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
the
state
adopted
these
procedures,
one
of
the
primary
reasons,
was
because
the
courts
had
held
that
the
state
could
no
longer
treat
admissions
through
this
record
review
process
and
upon
the
substituted
consent
of
guardians
as
voluntary
admissions.
the
lower
courts
held
that
there
could
be
no
more
voluntary
admissions,
that
all
admissions
to
the
state's
facility
would
have
to
be
made
utilizing
the
involuntary
admissions
procedures.
we
submit
that
that
was...
that's
clear
error,
that
that's
a
wrong
decision.
we
ask
that
you
reverse
that
decision,
restore
this
case
to
the
status
of
the
initial
decision
of
the
district
court
which
had
held
that
those
procedures
were
appropriate.
we
also
ask
that
you
reverse
the
decisions
below
with
regard
to
the
standard
of
evidence
and
with
regard
to
the
participation
of
parents,
family,
and
immediate
family
members.
mr.
william
k.
moore
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
can
and
should
prevail
regardless
of
the--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--under
any
type
of
review,
the
issue
for
equal
protection
purposes
is
whether
or
not
the
legislature
could
first
distinguish
a
group
of
people
as
a
class,
and
this
court
has
held
that
that's
clearly
appropriate
with
regard
to
the
mentally
retarded.
whether
or
not
the
perceived
benefits
or
detriments
of
any
legislation
are
something
that's
permissible
for
the
legislature
to
do...
and
there's
no
question
that
provision,
in
this
case,
of
a
safety
net
of
services
for
the
mentally
retarded
is
a
permissible
thing
for
the
legislature
to
do.
that's
the
purpose
of
these
facilities.
they
are
described
as
providing
developmental
nursing
services.
they
are
the
most
basic
level
of
service
for
persons
for
whom
there
is
no
other
place
where
they
can
be
cared
for.
that's
not
necessarily
the
situation
with
regard
to
the
mentally
ill,
your
honor.
furthermore,
the
only
way
that
the
mentally
retarded
person
can
receive
this
type
of
service
from
the
state
is
to
go
through
the
involuntary
commitment
process.
a
mentally
ill
person,
who
desires
to
be
admitted
to
a
state
mental
hospital,
does
not
have
to
be
involuntarily
admitted.
if
they
wish,
they
can
consent
and
be
admitted
voluntarily
without
going
through
the
involuntarily
admissions
process,
and
there
is
no
requirement
with
a
voluntary
admission
that
they
meet
the
criteria
for
involuntary
admission.
that
is
not
available
for
the
mentally
retarded.
for
that
reason,
the
two
situations
are
sufficiently
different.
mr.
william
k.
moore
there
is
a
kentucky
statute
which
requires
parental
support
for
any
child
who
is
determined
disabled
beyond
the
age
of
majority,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
you
do,
your
honor.
there
is
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
not
to,
and
i
believe
that
i
have
quoted
that
statute.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
william
k.
moore
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
does
not.
mr.
william
k.
moore
does
not.
mr.
william
k.
moore
does
not,
your
honor.
that
act
is
an
act
of
congress.
it
contains
certain
legislative
findings
explaining
why
congress
found
it
necessary
to
take
certain
actions.
there
are
claims
that
can
be
made
under
that
act.
there
are
no
claims
made
under
that
act
in
this
litigation.
the
argument
is
made
in
this
litigation
that
by
adopting
that
act,
the
legislature
or
congress
was
requiring
this
court
to
adopt
a
heightened
or
strict
standard
of
review
for
equal
protection
purposes.
we
submit
that
that
does
not
apply.
with
regard
to
the
ada
and
its
impact
upon
admissions
to
state
facilities,
that
prohibits
discrimination
based
on
the
disability
alone.
all
persons
who
are
admitted
to
the
state's
facilities
would
be
disabled
persons
or
have
disabilities
under
the
act
all
mentally
retarded
persons
would
have.
the
issue
could
perhaps
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
state,
if
it
is
to
have
any
effect,
that
it
should
permit
the
state
to
go
ahead
and
admit
people
without
following
through
with
the
involuntary
admission
procedures,
that
the
state
should
be
able
to
admit
the
mentally
retarded
people,
just
as
it
admits
mentally
ill
people
voluntarily.
mr.
william
k.
moore
the
court
of...
with
regard
to
the
participation
of
parents,
guardians,
and
immediate
family
members,
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
was
also
a
violation
of
due
process.
it
didn't
refer
to
procedural
due
process
or
substantive
due
process.
it
just
said
due
process.
mr.
william
k.
moore
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
william
k.
moore
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is.
mr.
william
k.
moore
your
honor,
we're
describing
the
first
class,
the
parents
and
immediate
family
members.
the
difference
in
the
reference
in
the
two
sections...
immediate
family
would,
obviously,
include
parents.
then
we
have
the
authorized
representative.
we
have
in
kentucky
a
department
who
serves
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
mentally
retarded.
it's
created
under
chapter
331
of
the
kentucky
revised
statutes.
they
offer
independent
assistance,
legal
assistance
included,
to
the
people
who
are
in
state
facilities
who
have
some
type
of
disability.
jack
farley
was
in
charge
of
that
department
at
the
time
the
action
was
brought.
he
was
named
as
a
party
and
was
dismissed
with
an
agreed
order
which...
by
which
he
agreed
to
abide
by
any
further
orders
of
the
court.
mentally
retarded
persons
can
designate
an
authorized
agent
with
that
department
who
can
pursue
their
legal
remedies
and
can
take
action
on
their
behalf
in
addition
to
actions
that
their
guardians
could
well
take.
mr.
william
k.
moore
the
issues
that
you've
described
are
the
issues
that
are
specified
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
william
k.
moore
we
believe
that
the
other
issue
is
an
overriding
issue
which
permeates
the
entire
case,
and
it
was
also
the
result
of
a
clear
error
below.
and
so,
for
that
reason,
this
court
should
address
that
issue
as
well
under
rule
24
of
this
court's
procedures.
it's
fully
briefed
in
our
brief
and
responded
to
in
the
respondents'
brief.
mr.
william
k.
moore
my
understanding
is
that
if
there's
a
matter
of
clear
error
in
the
courts
below,
this
court
can
go
ahead
and
address
that
as
well.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
my
understanding
of
rule
24,
your
honor.
the
issue
is
encompassed
within
all
of
the
other
issues
in
the
case
because
the
mentally
retarded
cannot
avail
themselves
of
the
procedures
that
are
available
to
the
mentally
ill
under
the
state
statutes.
the
mentally
retarded
do
not
have
an
opportunity
to
seek
treatment
other
than
by
first
going
through
this
lengthy,
expensive,
and
burdensome
process,
and
for
that
reason,
there
are
many
that
are
likely
or
whose
parents
or
guardians
are
likely
not
to
seek
that
type
of
treatment
that's
available
for
them,
which
would
and
should
be
beneficial
to
them.
mr.
william
k.
moore
your
honor,
the
procedures
that
were
in
effect
in
kentucky
at
the
time
the
litigation
began
and
weren't
in
effect
until
required
otherwise
by
the
court,
were
that
the
guardian
of
a
mentally
ill
person
could,
as
well,
admit
their
ward
on
the
guardian's
substituted
consent,
provided
there
was
a
review
by
an
independent
physician
at
the
facility,
for
treatment
at
a
state
mental
hospital.
the
procedures
were
the
same.
mr.
william
k.
moore
they're
different
because
of--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
addington
case,
this
court
held
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
evidence
was
the
appropriate
standard.
it
reviewed
the
other
standards
of
evidence
and
held
not
that
addington
was
a
floor,
but
that
that
was
the
appropriate
standard.
the
state
of--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--it
did
not
say
that
it
could
not,
but
it
appeared
to
chastise
the
states
who
had
that
standard,
and
most
of
the
states,
except
for
kentucky,
with
regard
to
admission
of
mentally
ill
persons,
has
reduced
their
standard
to
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
mr.
william
k.
moore
as
a
general
rule,
your
honor,
it
would
appear
that
it
would
be
easier
to
diagnose.
there
are
still
matters
that
have--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--that
could
be
a
factor
relied
upon
in
justifying
a
different
standard
of
admission,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
they
have
been,
your
honor.
they
have
been.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
has
recognized
that
they're
different.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
they're--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--okay.
if
your
honor
please,
perhaps
the
easiest
explanation
of
the
difference
came
from
paul
mann
who
was
the
psychologist,
whose
testimony
is
reprinted
in
the
record
of
the
joint
appendix
at
page
45.
he
described
that
mentally
ill
people
who...
they
may
be
psychotic
at
times,
but
they
also
have
a
time
when
they
are
not
psychotic.
they
have
a
base
reference
where,
as
a
general
rule,
they
are
competent
and
they
can
act
for
themselves.
mentally
retarded...
and
they
may
come
in
and
go
out
of
being
competent
or
having
abilities
and
having...
and
not
having
abilities.
the
mentally
retarded
person
does
not
change
like
that.
the
mentally
retarded
person's
situation
is
more
stable.
the
definition
of
mentally
retarded
requires
that
not
only
do
you
have
significantly
subaverage
intellectual
functioning,
but
also
deficits
in
adaptive
behavior.
these
things
may
change
somewhat
over
long
periods
of
time,
but
they
don't
change
like
a
mentally
ill
person--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--the
law
does
not
refer
to
either
one
directly.
it
refers
to
persons
who
are
adjudicated
to
be
disabled.
mr.
william
k.
moore
it
would
cover
a
small
percentage
of
the
mentally
ill,
your
honor,
but
it
would
not
cover
the
majority
of
the
mentally
ill
persons.
mr.
william
k.
moore
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
yes,
it
would.
there
may
be
a
very,
very
small
percentage
that
are
not
covered,
but
for
the
most
part,
they
are
covered.
i
think
in
the
testimony,
it
was
in
the
area
of
in
excess
of
98
percent.
there
may
be
one
or
two
persons
at
a
state
facility
who
has
not
been
adjudicated
to
be
disabled
and
has
a
guardian
appointed
for
them.
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
them
do
have
guardians
appointed
for
them.
mr.
william
k.
moore
your
honor,
it
would
appear
that
that
is
the
case,
that
it--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--if
your
honor
please,
it
was
not
my
intention
to
argue
necessarily
that
that
supported
the
decision
to
have
a
lower
standard
for
the
mentally
retarded.
i
was
recognizing
the
fact
that
it
would
appear
that
they
are
different,
although
not
necessarily
in
a
material
fashion.
there
are
several
factors
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
level
of
retardation.
the
information
that
was
submitted,
and
recognized
by
this
court,
from
the
american
association
for
the
mentally
retarded
describes
the
factors,
the
various
factors,
that
are
taken
into
account
to
determine
the
level
and
needs
of
the--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that
is
one
of
our
authorities
for
that.
mr.
william
k.
moore
okay.
addington
is
not
an
equal
protection
case.
addington
is
a
case
where
the
state
reads
the
court
has
established
what
it
determined
to
be
the
appropriate
standard
of
proof
in
any
type
of
civil
commitment
proceeding.
addington
did
not
deal
with
the
mentally
retarded.
mr.
william
k.
moore
the
addington
case
determined
that
there
was...
there
were
reasons
why
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
be
utilized,
that
that
was
the
best--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--the
connection,
to
the
extent
there
is
one,
your
honor,
is
that
with
regard
to
the
mentally
ill,
kentucky
has
made
a
mistake.
kentucky
has
put
a
higher
standard--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--it's
the
state's
position
that
if
you
apply
the
equal
protection
clause
in
that
fashion,
that
it
leads
to
a
bad
result
in
this
case.
mr.
william
k.
moore
my
understanding
of
equal
protection
is
that
it
does
not
require
an
additional
burden
on
a
party.
it
is
intended
to
make
sure
that
everyone
receives
the
benefit
of
the
law.
in
this
case,
the
mentally
ill
are
burdened
to
the
extent
that
they
cannot
receive
services
involuntarily
unless
they
meet
the
criteria
of
involuntarily
admission.
mr.
william
k.
moore
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
for
the
mentally
retarded
is
to
provide
again
that
safety
net,
a
base
level
of
services
for
people
who
cannot
be
cared
for
anywhere
else
so
that
they
don't
fall
through
the--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
focus
should
be
on
the
purpose,
the
reason
for
the
legislation.
the
reason
for
this
legislation
is
providing
basic
developmental
nursing
services
for
the
mentally
retarded
so
that
they
have
a
place
to
go
if
there's
no
place
else
in
the
community
where
they
can
go.
the
purpose
for
providing
involuntary
hospitalization
of
the
mentally
ill
is
not
necessarily--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--the
purpose
of
the
commitment
is
to
make
available
to
the
respondent
in
that
proceeding
the
services
that
the
state
is
providing.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
right.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that
is
a
justification,
your
honor.
your
honor,
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
k.
moore
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
cover
a
couple
of
points
in
rebuttal.
first,
the
question
was
asked
who
can
initiate
a
petition
to
involuntarily
commit
a
mentally
retarded
person.
the
statute
relating
to
that
is
set
forth
at
page
124
of
the
record.
basically
it's
not
just
anyone
who
desires
to
file
such
petition
can.
it
has
to
be
a
police
officer,
county
attorney,
commonwealth
attorney,
spouse,
relative,
friend,
or
guardian
of
the
person
for
whom
the
petition
is
filed.
it's
not
just
anyone
who
can...
not
a
stranger
who
can
initiate
these
proceedings.
also,
in
the
proceedings,
they
don't...
the
mentally
retarded
person
doesn't
go
through
the
matter
as
an
ordinary
person.
they
don't
get
to
the
hearing
phase
until
first
the
petition
is
filed,
the
probable
cause
hearing
is
held
by
the
court.
the
court
then
appoints
two
qualified
mental
retardation
professionals,
one
of
whom
must
be
a
doctor.
those
persons
must
evaluate,
conduct
an
evaluation
of
the
mentally
retarded
person
immediately
within
24
hours,
and
certify
both
of
them
to
the
court
that
the
person
is
mentally
retarded
and
that
they
do
meet
the
criteria
for
involuntary
admission.
if
those
certifications
are
not
filed,
if
the
professionals
do
not
agree,
then
the
petition
is
dismissed.
mr.
william
k.
moore
the
statute
addresses
all
mentally
retarded
people.
the
statute
for
involuntary
commitment
does
not
limit
itself
to
only
that
subgroup
of
the
mentally
retarded...
or
those
subgroups.
the
vast
majority
of
the
mentally
retarded
persons
in
the
state
facilities
fall
into
those
two
groups.
there
are
only
770
beds
or
spaces
available
in
the
state
facilities.
in
its
second
memorandum
opinion
on
the
matter,
the
court
described
the
number
of
people
at
state
facilities
who
suffered
from
severe,
profound,
and
then
lumped
together
mild
and
moderate.
the
court
made
a
finding
of
approximately
100.
the
number
would
be
more
in
the
range
of
50.
there
are
some
persons
who
may
only
be
mildly
or
moderately
retarded
who
nevertheless
require
that
they
receive
services
in
one
of
these
facilities
because
they
may
have
things
wrong
with
them
other
and
in
addition
to
mental
retardation.
they
may
be
epileptic.
they
may
have
cerebral
palsy.
they
may
have
any
number
of
medical
conditions
which
render
them
having
acute
medical
care
needs
where
they
need
to
be
taken
care
of
essentially
at
a
nursing
home.
and
that's
what
an
icf/mr
is.
it's
a
nursing
home
with
programs
designed
specifically
for
the
mentally
retarded.
so,
there
would
be
a
few
individuals
that
do
fall
into
those--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--upon
the
filing
of
the
petition,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
yes,
and
the
state
pays
for
the--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--well,
we
have
a
probable
cause
hearing
where
the
judge
interviews
the
person.
mr.
william
k.
moore
we
have
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
william
k.
moore
then
we
have
a
final
hearing
or
an
adjudicative
hearing.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
no.
he's
an
attorney.
it's
not
a
guardian
ad
litem.
it
is
an
attorney
to
represent--
mr.
william
k.
moore
--he
should
be.
as
a
practical
matter,
he
may
not
be
able
to
be
present
at
the
probable
cause
hearing
because
oftentimes
that's
conducted
immediately
upon
the
filing
of
the
petition.
but
he
would
be
present
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
most
definitely
at
the
final
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
moore
your
honor,
our
statutes
says
you
appoint
an
attorney,
and
the
practice,
as
respondents'
counsel
described,
is
one
where
that
person
sees
their
role
as
advocating
freedom.
mr.
william
k.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
