mr.
moore,
if
heightened
scrutiny
were
applied,
as
was
suggested
by
the
plurality
in
that
foucha
case,
do
you
think
you
could
prevail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
you
justify
it
then
under
any
higher
standard
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
kentucky
law
require
the
parent
of
a
mentally
retarded
child
to
continue
to
provide
support
after
the
age
of
majority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
does
the
americans
with
disabilities
act...
is
that
relevant
here?
does
that
impact
on
what
the
state
can
do
in
terms
of
its
involuntary
admission
procedures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
it
does?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
court
say
that
a
higher
standard
could
not
be
employed
by
the
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
in
general
terms,
is
mentally
retardation,
at
least
for
adults...
and
i
guess
that's
who
we're
talking
about
here...
easier
to
diagnose
than
is
mental
illness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
justify
a
different
standard
for
admission?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
the
due
process
clause
would
certainly
justify
this
court's
previous
decisions
that
say
to
involuntarily
commit,
you
need
to
have
at
least
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard.
the
state
has
such
a
standard
here.
we
have
said
that
is
a
sufficient
standard,
have
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
so,
what
we
now
have
to
try
to
justify,
if
it
can
be,
is
whether
the
state
can
have
a
higher
standard
for
the
involuntary
commitment
of
mentally
ill
as
opposed
to
those
who
are
mentally
retarded
and
to
explore
whether
there
are,
indeed,
any
differences
in
those
two
categories
of
people
that
would
justify
a
different
standard.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
not
here
to
argue
that
it
isn't
a
protected
liberty
interest
and
that
they
have
to
have
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
they
have
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
samuel
doe
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
there
any
named
plaintiffs
in
the
class
that
are
presently
institutionalized?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
wide
is
it?
it's
parents
and
immediate
family?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
a
guardian
at
litem
appointed?
