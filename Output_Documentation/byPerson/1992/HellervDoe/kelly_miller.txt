ms.
kelly
miller
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
argument
before
the
court
today
is
twofold
that
presents
simply
issues
of
equal
protection
and
due
process.
first,
in
looking
at
the
equal
protection
argument,
kentucky
would
treat
persons
with
mental
retardation
differently
from
the
mentally
ill
in
the
involuntary
commitment
process
without
any
constitutionally
adequate
reason
for
the
differing
treatment.
they've
had
11
years
since
this
case
was
filed
in
1982
to
come
up
with
a
reason.
they
came
here
today.
they
still
didn't
have
one.
ms.
kelly
miller
chief
justice,
in
response
to
your
question,
we
would
agree
that
justice
scalia
presented
a
very
good
question,
but
what's
here
is
not
the
case.
this
case...
this
court
recognized
in
cleburne
that
mentally
retarded
persons
are
all
not
cut
from
the
same
pattern,
that
they
have
wide-ranging
capabilities
and
abilities,
that
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum,
they
need
care
and
constant
attention.
at
the
other
end,
they're
not
easily
distinguishable
as
being
mentally
retarded.
so,
in
that
regard,
we
would
say
mentally
retarded
as
a
group
themselves
are
widely
varied.
ms.
kelly
miller
we
would
submit
that
equal
protection
should
be
viewed
under
the
case
of
foucha
which
said
that
when
something
is
at
stake--
ms.
kelly
miller
--the
plurality
opinion,
your
honor.
ms.
kelly
miller
because
what
foucha
was
dealing
with
is
exactly
what
we're
dealing
here,
a
fundamental
interest
at
stake,
a
massive
curtailment
of
liberty
that
this
court
had
recognized
as
early
as
humphrey
v.
cady
and
in
addington
and
o'connor,
and
most
recently
last
year
in
the
plurality
opinion
of
foucha.
so,
given
that
we
have
a
massive
curtailment
of
liberty
at
stake...
and
one
thing
i
would
like
to
correct
is
that
we
do
have
a
liberty
interest
at
stake
here.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
that
these
institutions
are
not
restrictive
placements.
in
fact,
in
the
joint
appendix,
dr.
skarnulis,
who's
director
of
community
services
for
the
mentally
retarded,
had
said
that
these
are
restrictive
placements.
ms.
kelly
miller
that's
correct,
and--
ms.
kelly
miller
--that's
correct.
ms.
kelly
miller
that's
correct.
for
purposes
of
the
burden
of
proof
argument...
there
are
two
arguments
here:
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
injection
of
the
third
parties.
for
purposes
of
the
burden
of
proof,
we
have
never
argued
that
due
process
requires
more
than
clear
and
convincing
under
addington.
but
what
we're
saying
and
in
looking
at
the
cases
of
baxtrom
and
cleburne
and
the
equal
protection
analysis,
that
there
has
to
be
a
reason,
and
that
reason
is
going
to
have
to
be
more
important
as
what's
at
stake
is
more
important.
and
what
we
have
here
at
stake
is
a
massive
curtailment
of
liberty.
the
controlling
factor
in
this
case
is
that
all
these
persons
facing
institutionalization
are
simply
ordinary
citizens.
to
make
any
presumptions
on
the
fact
that
they
are
labeled
mentally
retarded
before
they
come
to
the
process
to
see
if
they
even
are
mentally
retarded--
ms.
kelly
miller
--well,
justice
white,
i
would
agree
and
disagree.
i
would
agree
that
the
state
could
certainly
go
back
to
the
next
legislative
session
and
lower
the
burden
of
proof
for
the
mentally
ill.
we
have
an
argument--
ms.
kelly
miller
--well,
the
one
thing...
two
things
i'd
point
out.
one,
in
1990
when
they
did
lower
the
standard
of
proof
for
the
mentally
retarded,
they
in
fact
tried
for
the
mentally
ill
and
could
not
succeed,
the
reason
being
that
addington
talks
about
burden
of
proof
being
more
than
an
empty
semantic
exercise.
what
it
is
is
it's
a
value
that
society
is
placing
on
that
person's
individual
liberty
that's
at
risk,
and
if
kentucky
is
going
to
place
that
value,
that
high
of
a
value,
for
the
mentally
ill,
why
should
they
not
do
it
for
the
mentally
retarded
without
some
good
reason...
a
good
reason?
and
under
foucha,
we
would
say
that
they
would
have
to
have
a
particular
convincing
reason.
what
the
state
is
saying
and
has
said
in
their
brief
is
in
their
perspective,
that
these
people
are
in
need
of
treatment.
we
would
dispute
that
overriding
vision
that
they've
given
the
court
today
that
this
is
why
we're
committing
these
people
because
the
record
reflects
in
dr.
skarnulis'
deposition
that
1
person
in
an
institution,
no
matter
how
profound
or
severe...
for
that
1
person,
there
are
10
in
kentucky
in
the
community
living
with
the
needed
support
services.
ms.
kelly
miller
the
injection
of
the
third
persons
is
simply
a
due
process
and
an
equal
protection
argument.
kentucky
would
inject
into
the
involuntary
commitment
procedure
a
widely
and
vaguely
defined
group
of
persons,
some
with
very
little
connection
to
the
person.
i
did
want
to
clarify--
ms.
kelly
miller
--exactly.
under
the
challenge
statute--
ms.
kelly
miller
--exactly,
justice
white.
what
the
state
has
done
is
they
have
given
to
these
third
persons...
and
remembering
that
it's
a
wide-ranging
group
of
persons,
and
we
are
challenging
every
section,
including
the
one--
ms.
kelly
miller
--not
always.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
every
time
that
a
parent
comes
that
they
are,
in
fact,
a
guardian
or
that
a
guardian
is
appointed
in
addition.
now,
we
do
not
dispute
a
parent
or
a
guardian
or
any
caring
person's
ability
to
come
to
this
involuntary
commitment
proceeding
to
present
evidence,
to
testify,
to
say
why
they
believe
their
adult
son
or
daughter
should
be
an
institution.
ms.
kelly
miller
well,
in
kentucky
under
the
involuntary
statutory
scheme,
the
mentally
retarded,
as
well
as
the
mentally
ill,
have
a
right
to
an
attorney.
there
is
not
a
guardian
appointed,
but
they
have
a
right
to
an
attorney
that's
going
to
advocate
vigorously
the
case
for
freedom,
which
is
what
the
involuntary
commitment
proceeding
is
all
about.
ms.
kelly
miller
exactly.
it's
twofold:
first,
that
they're
mentally
retarded
or
mentally
ill;
second,
that
they're
dangerous
to
themselves,
the
family,
or
others,
that
they're
in
need
of
treatment,
and
that
this
is
the
least
restrictive
placement
available.
ms.
kelly
miller
that
would
be
correct.
ms.
kelly
miller
first,
justice
scalia,
we're
talking
about
adults,
and
what
we
have
here
in
kentucky
is
an
adversary
proceeding.
ms.
kelly
miller
i
respectfully
disagree
on
a
couple
counts.
ms.
kelly
miller
one
is
when
you
come
to
the
involuntary
commitment
proceeding,
there
has
been
no
adjudication
of
a
guardian.
there
has
been
no
adjudication
that
you're
disabled
or
incompetent.
you
come
there
simply
as
an
ordinary
citizen
to
this
hearing.
secondly,
it
is
the
state
that
prosecutes
this.
ms.
kelly
miller
the
attorney--
ms.
kelly
miller
--in
kentucky...
and
we
agree
that
it
is
unique,
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
set
up
basically
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
in
fact,
the
rules
say
this
will
function
as
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
is
the
county
attorney
that
prosecutes
the
case,
the
petition
for
commitment.
it
is
the
attorney
for
the
mentally
retarded
adult
that
advocates
for
freedom.
there
are
simply
two
interests
at
stake.
ms.
kelly
miller
the
county
attorney?
ms.
kelly
miller
by
statute.
ms.
kelly
miller
no,
and
all
circumstances--
ms.
kelly
miller
--at
the
very
beginning.
once
a
petition
is
taken--
ms.
kelly
miller
--in
practicality,
justice
white,
what
happens
is
a
person
can
take
the
petition
out
to
have
an
adult
committed
to
one
of
these
four
institutions.
ms.
kelly
miller
any
person.
it
can
be
a
family--
ms.
kelly
miller
--exactly,
family,
guardian.
and
then
what
happens,
it
goes--
ms.
kelly
miller
--exactly.
ms.
kelly
miller
and
that
petition
is
prosecuted
by
the
county
attorney
in
the
county
in
which
the
mentally
retarded
person
resides,
and
it's
held
before
a
judge
and,
if
the
mentally
retarded
person
requests
it,
a
jury.
ms.
kelly
miller
yes.
ms.
kelly
miller
i
frankly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
from
the
quarterly
reports
that
we've
gotten,
since
the
hearings
have
been
conducted
since
1986,
all
cases
have
been
prosecuted.
ms.
kelly
miller
i
filed
the
complaint
in
1982.
ms.
kelly
miller
along
with
other
co-counsel.
ms.
kelly
miller
and
we
represent
samuel
doe,
not
sammy
doe,
and
he's
an
adult.
and
he
was
in
an
institution
at
the
time
that
we
filed.
ms.
kelly
miller
this
is
a
class
action,
and
we
represent
all
adults
in
kentucky
that
are
potentially
facing
involuntary
confinement
in
a
state
institution.
ms.
kelly
miller
samuel
doe,
since
the
filing
of
the
case,
has
been
released
and
is
in
a
small
residential
placement.
he
was
a
profound,
severely
retarded
man
in
his
30's
when
we
filed,
and
now
is...
he's
in
a
residential
home.
ms.
kelly
miller
no,
they're
not.
what
we
have
is
we
represent
a
class
that
has
been
described
by
the
district
court
as
both
those
in
the
institution
and
those
that
may
face
institution.
samuel
doe
we
filed
through
his...
by
and
his
next
friend,
his
mother,
who
has
concerns
that
after
she
dies,
she
wants
to
make
sure
that
her
adult
son
is
given
all
the
protections
that
all
other
ordinary
citizens
are
under
this
constitution.
ms.
kelly
miller
well,
we
argue
that
it
violates
both
equal
protection
and
due
process.
ms.
kelly
miller
exactly,
justice
white.
ms.
kelly
miller
that
would
be
true,
and
the
reason
that
we
say
that
is
that
the
involuntary
commitment
proceeding
is
a
very
narrowly
defined
procedure
where
what's
at
stake
is
the
liberty
interests
of
the
individual
adult
facing
commitment
and
the
parens
patriae
interests
of
the
state.
those
are
the
interests
and
those
are
the
parties.
to
allow
any
third
persons,
even
this
wide,
varied,
vaguely
defined
group
that
the
statute
has,
would--
ms.
kelly
miller
--it
changes
in
the
statute
according
to
a
right
the
state
wants
to
give
persons.
in...
excuse
me...
in
certain
circumstances
on
joint
appendix
127,
it
shows
that
if
you
want
to
retain
an
expert
witness
for
the
jury
trial
or
hearing
procedure,
that's
given
to
parents
and
guardians.
if
you
want
to
give
third
persons
the
right
to
act
as
if
parties,
that
is
given
to
immediate
family
members,
not
defined,
and
guardians.
if
you
want
to
appeal
an
adverse
decision,
that
role
or
that
right
is
given
to
guardians,
limited
guardians,
and
other
authorized
representatives,
again
not
defined
by
statute
and
unclear.
ms.
kelly
miller
first
we
would
argue
under
equal
protection,
that
the
mentally
ill
are
not
similarly
burdened
in
that
they
are
not
facing
two
prosecutors.
basically
what
we're
saying
is
these
third
persons
are
standing
alongside
the
state
in
this
involuntary
commitment
proceeding
arguing
the
case
for
commitment.
ms.
kelly
miller
yes.
ms.
kelly
miller
well,
chief
justice,
in
trying
to
determine
what
does
due
process
require
if
you
look
to
the
mathews
case,
the
first
thing
is
what's
the
private
interest
at
stake.
we
would
argue
the
private
interest--
ms.
kelly
miller
--for
the
parents,
it
is
both
an
equal
protection
and
a
due
process.
ms.
kelly
miller
we
are
saying
to
inject
these
vaguely
defined
third
parties
into
the
process
would
upset
the
balance
that
mathews
envisions
and
that
vitek
envisions
in
an
involuntary
commitment
process
because
what's
at
stake
is
the
liberty
of
the
adult.
ms.
kelly
miller
justice
scalia,
we
would
argue
that
it's
still
a
violation
of
due
process
because
you're
having
the
mentally
retarded
adult
face
another
party,
face
another
court.
ms.
kelly
miller
that's
true,
but
what
we
would
say
is
that
under
mathews,
what
interests
do
these--
ms.
kelly
miller
--again,
what
we
would
say
is
looking
at
the
mathews
test...
and
i'm
trying
to
make
sense
of
this
for
you...
what's
at
stake
for
the
parents
and
other
vaguely
defined
third
persons,
these
other
authorized
representatives,
the
limited
guardians,
they
have
no
liberty
interest
at
stake.
ms.
kelly
miller
we
would
argue
that
it
violates
due
process
because
before
you
even
come
into
the
involuntary
commitment
process,
it
skews
the
balance
in
favor
of
commitment.
ms.
kelly
miller
i
think
an
appropriate
analogy
here
that
might
help
the
court
understand,
that
in
the
criminal
proceeding--
ms.
kelly
miller
--i
think
what
mathews
was
getting
at
in
the
second
prong
is
what's
the
risk
under
the
procedures
used.
and
granted,
here--
ms.
kelly
miller
--well,
we
would
say,
justice
souter,
that
the
risk
is
that
that
it
is
tipping
the
scales
in
favor
of
confinement.
ms.
kelly
miller
i
may
be
confused
on
this.
our
burden
of
proof
argument
is
simply
under
the
equal
protection
analysis,
and
i'm
trying
to
get
back
to--
ms.
kelly
miller
--that's
correct.
ms.
kelly
miller
given
that
this
is
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
if
the
burden
of
proof
were
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
is
a
much
closer
call.
but
i
think
a
close
analogy
would
be
in
the
criminal
context,
and
the
statute
for
the
mentally
retarded
and
the
mentally
ill
in
the
involuntary
commitment
process
is
to
be
held
as
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
would
be
as
allowing
victims
of
crimes
to
come
into
a
prosecutorial
role
during
the
criminal
hearing.
it's
tipping
the
balance--
ms.
kelly
miller
--it's
not
an
identical
analogy.
i'm
just
trying
to
assist
the
court
in
trying
to
envision
how
it's
upsetting
the
balance.
one
thing
that
might
be
helpful,
in
looking
at
record
67
at
pages
39,
what
happened
was
at
one
point
a
mentally
retarded
adult
was
in
hazelwood,
one
of
the
four
facilities.
he
wanted
out.
what
happened
was
is
the
parents
said
"absolutely
not,
i
don't
want
my
adult
son
out.
"
he
had
an
attorney.
the
attorney's
deposition
is
from
patty
walker.
she
said
that
once
the
mother
said
"i
don't
want
you
out
and
if
you
step
out
of
that
institution,
i'm
not
going
to
ever
see
you
again.
"
it
was
enough.
it
was
enough
for
that
adult
to
say
"i'm
not
going
to
try
and
get
out.
"
ms.
kelly
miller
no.
we
certainly
think
that
anything--
ms.
kelly
miller
--that
is
the
truth,
but
one...
in
kentucky
one
of
the
things
that
we've
seen
in
the
record
here
is
that
parents
often
have
an
interest
adverse
to
the
liberty
interest
of
the
adult
facing
confinement.
certainly
they
have
interests.
no
matter
how
well
motivated,
we're
saying
that
they
have
no
play
in
this
procedure
because
what's
at
focus
is
that
adult's
liberty
interest.
and
to
take
away
from
that
by
injecting
this
wide-ranging
third
parties
is
to
demean
the
due
process
that
they're
getting,
putting
aside
all
the
equal
protection
arguments,
because
the
mentally
ill
are
not
similarly
burdened
by
these
third
persons.
ms.
kelly
miller
we
would
not
say
that,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
attorney
in
the
role
of
an
advocate
is
the
advocate
for
freedom.
the
adversary
proceedings
set
up
by
this
court
in
vitek--
ms.
kelly
miller
--exactly.
that's
their
role
as
attorney.
ms.
kelly
miller
justice
scalia,
that
may,
in
fact,
be
true
in
an
individualized
case,
but
the
record
shows
in
dr.
skarnulis'
deposition
that
97
to
98
percent
of
the
mentally
retarded
adults
in
kentucky
live
outside
the
institution,
and
for
every
1
person
in,
there's
10
adults
out
with
equally
severe
handicaps
and
mental
retardation.
and
so,
we
would
say
that
it
can
be
a
very
close
call
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people
meet
the
involuntary
criteria.
and
that's
what
vitek
said.
when
this
massive
curtailment
of
liberty
is
at
stake,
you're
entitled
to
an
adversary
hearing
where
the
adult
gets
to
advocate
vigorously
for
freedom.
one
thing
i
think
that
is
critical,
in
going
to
our
equal
protection
argument,
is
the
state
has
had
11
years
to
come
up
with
a
good
reason,
and
under
foucha
we
would
say
a
particularly
convincing
reason,
to
treat
the
mentally
retarded
differently
from
the
mentally
ill
because
under
equal
protection,
we
say
that
all
persons
in
kentucky
facing
involuntary
confinement
are
simply
civil
commitment
candidates.
they're
the
ordinary
citizens
that
are
about
to
have
their
liberty
deprived.
to
take
the
label
of
mental
retardation
and
to
make
assumptions
from
that
label
as
to
their
capabilities
and
their
abilities
is
wrong.
to
make
assumptions--
ms.
kelly
miller
--justice--
ms.
kelly
miller
--justice
scalia,
there
are
four
categories:
mild,
moderate,
profound,
severe.
the
statute--
ms.
kelly
miller
--absolutely
not.
the
statute
makes
no
distinctions.
one
correction,
a
factual
correction.
counsel
stated
that
there
are
no
provisions
for
voluntary
admission
to
a
state
institution.
that's
not
correct.
on
page
120
of
the
joint
appendix,
one
of
the
statutes
that
we
actually
challenged
at
the
district
court
dealt
with
the
mild
and
moderate
being
able
to
voluntarily
admit
themselves
to
one
of
these
state
institutions.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
there
was
no
case
of
controversy.
so,
that
statute
still
in
fact
stands.
ms.
kelly
miller
what
happens
in
kentucky
is
there
is
an
involuntary
commitment
procedure.
it
applies
to
the
mild,
moderate,
profound,
severe.
the
statute
makes
no
distinctions.
in
other
words,
a
parent
could
take
a
petition
out
on
an
adult
son
or
daughter
that
was
mildly
retarded,
go
through
the
petition,
go
through
the
hearing
process
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
person
was
mentally
retarded
and
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
or
herself
and
others.
it's
not
a
narrowly
crafted
statute
that
applies
only
to
profound
and
severe
and
only
let's--
ms.
kelly
miller
--we
would
argue
that
the
subtleties
and
nuances
of
whether
or
not
one--
ms.
kelly
miller
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
institutional
population,
out
of
the
800,
approximately
100
are
mild
or
moderate.
so,
it
is
possible
for
those
individuals
to
be
committed.
i
think
what
is
more
telling
in
the
record,
that
for
every
1
person
in,
again
10
are
out.
for
the
equally
severe,
the
profound
and
severe
can
be
served
outside
the
institution.
dr.
skarnulis,
who
was
the
high
ranking
cabinet
official
for
the
state,
said
that
the
profound
and
severe
can
be
served
outside
the
institution
and,
in
fact,
are
being
served
outside
the
institution
today.
this
is
what
makes
the
question
of
dangerousness
much
more
difficult.
in
conclusion,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
we
would
argue
that
what
the
state
has
said
in
their
brief
time
and
time
again
is
that
there's
no
liberty
interest
at
stake.
and
they
said
that
again
here
today
because
they
view
persons
with
mental
retardation
as
perpetual
children,
as
peter
pan
figures,
as
in
need
of
constant
care
and
support.
this
looks
and
feels
wrong
because
the
record
doesn't
reflect
it.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
state
has
had
11
years
under
the
equal
protection
analysis
to
come
up
with
a
reason
for
treating
these
two
groups
differently.
certainly
a
state
could
treat
the
two
groups
differently
if
they
had
a
good
reason
that
was
related--
ms.
kelly
miller
--i
hope
not.
ms.
kelly
miller
well,
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
when
we
first
filed
it,
justice
white,
there
were
statutory
procedures
on
the
books
for
the
involuntary
commitment
process.
counsel
for
the
state
argued
that
they
had
an
informal
process
whereby
they
considered
all
commitments
voluntary.
we
challenged
that.
it
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional,
went
to
the
sixth
circuit,
still
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
this
case...
this
court
denied
cert.--
the
legislature
came
back
in
in
1988
and
made
changes.
so,
it
has
been
an
ongoing
series
of
the
legislative
body
changing
the
statute,
and
we
are
back
here
on
the
statute
that
was
rewritten
in
1990.
but
what
we
would
say
is
that
what
kentucky
does
is
they
base
these
changes,
these
statutory
sections
that
we
are
challenging,
on
a
stereotype,
a
stereotype
of
mentally
retarded
persons.
that
means
if
you're
mentally
retarded
or
allegedly
mentally
retarded,
that
you're
dangerous,
in
need
of
commitment.
we're
saying
that
the
court
should
reject
the
stereotype
and
reject
the
statute
on
which
it
is
challenged.
thank
you.
