i
don't...
i
don't
remember
the
question.
do
you
want
to
tell
me
what
it
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
long,
do
you
have
any
other
cases
besides
swift
where
we've
supposedly
said
that
there's
an...
a
separate
dangerous
probability?
i
don't
read
swift
as
saying
that
there
is
a
separate
dangerous
probability
requirement.
what
swift
says
is
that
where
the
acts
are
not
sufficient
in
themselves
to
produce
the
monopoly
but
require
further
acts,
then
an
intent
is
necessary
in
order
to
produce
the
dangerous
probability.
the
intent
is
what
produces
the
dangerous
probability.
and
then
holmes
goes
on
to
say
but
when
that
intent
and
the
consequent
dangerous
probability
exists,
this
statute,
blah,
blah,
blah,
applies.
justice

plus
proximity,
okay.
and...
and
you...
you
think
that...
that
market
share
is
proximity?
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
what...
what's
the
other
case
you
mentioned?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
then
congress
should
have...
if
congress
felt
that
way
about
that
conduct,
it
should
have
simply
rendered
that
conduct
unlawful.
it
should
have
said
that
such
conduct
has
no
justification,
we
render
it
unlawful.
it
did
not
say
that.
what
it
rendered
unlawful
was
an
attempt
to
monopolize.
now,
there
may
be
very
bad
conduct
that...
that
has
no
justification,
but
unless
it...
it
constitutes
an
attempt
to
monopolize,
how
can
we
simply
assume
it
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
make
sense
as
an
attempt
to
monopolize
either,
unless
there's...
unless
there's
market
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
makes
no
sense
at
all,
but
isn't
that
the
plaintiff's
burden--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
show
that
it
only
makes
sense
in...
in
this
respect?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
that's
true.
why
is
that
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
not
down
the
road
to
a
dangerous
path,
even...
even
with
something
as...
you
know,
as
obvious
as
price
fixing.
you
can
call
that
anticompetitive
but
it's
not
anticompetitive
if
you...
if
you're
in
a...
in
a
fully
competitive
market
and...
and
the
people
who
are
involved
in
the
price
fixing
do
not,
together,
have
market
power,
that's
not
a
dangerous
path
at
all.
they're
just
cutting
off
their
own
nose
to
spite
their
face.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
going
to
go
out
of
business.
it's
dangerous
to
them,
not
to
the
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
per
se
rules
presume
that
when
there's
a
conspiracy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
a
conspiracy
contributes
to
the
whole
thing
added
danger.
