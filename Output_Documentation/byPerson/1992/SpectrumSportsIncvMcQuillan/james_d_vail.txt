mr.
james
d.
vail
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
you
are
asked
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
to
reject
the
rule
first
announced
in
lessig
v.
tidewater
oil.
you
should
do
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
lessig
rule
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
section
2
jurisprudence.
second,
the
lessig
rule
cannot
be
reconciled
with
economic
reality.
and
third,
the
lessig
rule
does
not
promote
competition,
but
harms
it.
these
are
the
key
facts.
spectrum
sports
and
the
mcquillans'
distributed
sorbothane
athletic
insoles;
each
bought
the
sorbothane
insoles
from
a
manufacturer
and
had
a...
and
resold
them
to
retailers.
each
of
the
parties
had
an
exclusive
geographic
territory
in
which
they
sold
the
sorbothane
insoles.
both
parties
started
selling
the
soles
in
1981,
and
sorbo,
inc.
terminated
the
mcquillans'
distributorship
in
august,
1983.
thereafter,
spectrum
became
the
national
distributor
of
sorbothane
insoles.
the
trial
court
entered
judgment
for
the
mcquillans
on
their
section
2
claim.
it
also
entered
judgment
on
behalf
of
spectrum
sports,
finding
it
not
to
have
adjudged...
excuse
me,
finding
it
not
to
have
violated
section
1
in
the
mcquillans'
price
fixing
claim.
the
appellate
court
affirmed
solely
on
its
conclusion
that
the
trial
record
supported
the
mcquillans'
attempt
to
monopolize
claim.
it
declined
to
address
any
of
the
other
issues
that
were
presented
on
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
lessig
rule,
which
permits
a
judge
or
a
jury
to
find
an
attempt
to
monopolize
violation
without
analyzing
the
relevant
market
and
determining
violation
to
have
occurred
based
solely
on
the
defendant's
conduct.
that
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
rule
of
this
court.
this
court
has
long
stated
that
in
an
attempt
to
monopolize
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
defendant
has
a
reasonable
or
dangerous
probability
of
succeeding
in
monopolizing.
this
is
usually
proved
by
examining
the
relevant
market
and
examining
the
defendant's
power
in
that
market.
without
knowing
what
the
defendant's
market
power
is,
a
fact
finder
cannot
determine
how,
if
at
all,
the
defendant's
conduct
will
affect
a
particular
market.
and
if
we--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--we
care,
your
honor,
because
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
to
protect
competition,
to
make
sure
that
consumers
are
not--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--well,
not--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--our
position
is
that
that
is
not
necessarily
the
case.
without
examining
the
conduct
in
the
context
of
a
relevant
market,
one
cannot
determine
whether
the
defendant's
conduct
will
harm
competition.
one
is
unable
to
distinguish
between
conduct
that
may
be
undertaken
with
the
goal
of
monopolizing
from
conduct
that
is
undertaken
for
personal
reasons.
one
cannot
determine,
for
example--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
predatory
is
somewhat
difficult
to
define
in
the
first
instance.
but
moreover,
the
same
conduct
might
be
undertaken
by
a
market
player
with
2
percent
of
the
market
as
with...
as
one
who
has
80
percent
of
the
market.
certainly,
the
party
that
has
2
percent
of
the
market
is
not
likely
to
be
able
to
affect
that
marketplace
and
harm
competition.
there
may
be
some
effect
on
the
competitor,
but
there
are
other
laws
to
deal
with
harm
to
another
competitor.
the
lessig
rule
converts
a
section
2,
an
attempt
to
monopolize
analysis,
from
one
which
requires
an
analysis
of
the
market
and
the
impact
on
the
market
to
a
per
se
analysis
based
solely
on
the
defendant's
conduct.
this
court
has
shown
an
aversion
to
extending
the
per
se
rule,
and
that
would
be...
it
would
be
even
less
appropriate
to
extend
it
to
a
section
2
case.
the...
the
lessig
rule
has
been
rejected
by
every
other
court
of
appeals
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
permits
there
to
be
a
finding
of
antitrust,
of
a
section
2
violation,
without
determining
anything
more
than
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
conduct
has
been
improper.
there
is
no
distinction
made
based
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
section
2
analysis
which
looks
at
only
unilateral
conduct.
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit,
relies
solely
on
the
defendant's
conduct
and
permits
an
inference
of
specific
intent
and
then--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--in
order
to
find
a
section
2
violation.
mr.
james
d.
vail
the
jury
was
charged
that
it
could
find
a
section
2
violation
based
on
attempt
to
monopolize,
monopolization,
or
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
found
that
there...
under
the
lessig
rule
there
was
adequate
evidence
to
support
an
attempt
to
monopolize
violation
and
chose
not
to
reach
any
of
the
other
issues
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
james
d.
vail
the
ninth
circuit
said
that...
looked
to
evidence
in
the
record
that
spectrum
sports...
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the...
that
spectrum
sports
attempted
to
fix
prices,
even
though
the
jury
had
determined
it
did
not.
it
also
looked
to
evidence
of
what
it
deemed
unfair
conduct
in
which
spectrum
sports
stated
to
mrs.
mcquillan
that
if
she
did
not
sell
her
distributorship
she
would
be
out
looking
for
work.
and
from
that,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
there
was
adequate
evidence
to
establish
an
attempt
to
monopolize
case.
mr.
james
d.
vail
i
think
that's
how--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--that's...
that's
how
the
ninth
circuit
inference
works.
but,
in
fact,
although
many
of
the
circuits
will
allow
specific
intent
to
be
inferred,
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
disregards
or
permits
the
inference
of
dangerous
probability
of
success.
and
our
point
is
that
nothing
about
the
conduct
or
even
the
intent
that
might
be
inferred
can
provide
assistance
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
defendant
actually
has
a
probability
of
monopolizing.
and
it
becomes
all
the
more
dangerous
when
we're
looking
at
section...
a
section
2
claim
where...
which...
where
unilateral
behavior
is
more
likely
to
be
chilled.
there
is
a...
there
is
really
no
benefit
that
is
provided
by
the
lessig
rule.
mr.
james
d.
vail
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
ninth
circuit
permits...
permits
the
dangerous
probability
element
to
be
based
solely
on
conduct.
the...
the
charge
specifically
says
if
you
find
the
conduct
to
be
predatory,
or
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
deemed
if
it
were
unfair,
then
you
may
proceed
to
infer
that
there
is
a...
that
the
defendant
has
a
dangerous
probability
of
succeeding
in
monopolizing.
and
our
position
is
there
is
nothing
about
the
defendant's
conduct
that
can
allow
you
to
conclude
that
that
defendant
has
a
realistic
possibility
or
probability
of
monopolizing
any
particular
market.
mr.
james
d.
vail
yes,
we
are
challenging
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case.
we
did
challenge
them
on
appeal.
mr.
james
d.
vail
and
we
are...
we
are
challenging
them
in
the
context
that
they
were
given
because
of
the
ninth...
because
the
ninth
circuit
permits
the
lessig...
the
ninth
circuit
lessig
rule.
mr.
james
d.
vail
yes.
mr.
james
d.
vail
we
think
that
the
lessig
instruction
is
inappropriate
and
that
the
case
ought
to
be
reversed
with
instructions
that
it
may
not
use...
rely
on
the
lessig
rule.
the...
one
aspect
of
the
harm
of
the
lessig
rule
is
that
it...
it
truly
harms
competition.
it
allows,
for
example,
a
competitor
with
80
percent
of
the
market,
to
claim
that
its
10
percent
competitor
has
violated
section
2
because
the
10
percent
competitor
has
been
able
to
secure
2
points
of
the
market
share
from
the
80
percent
competitor.
the
80
percent
competitor
may
deem
that...
the
2
percent...
may
deem
the
smaller
competitor's
conduct
to
have
been
unfair
and
may
think
that
it
was
predatory,
however
that
is
defined
in
that
instance,
and
file
a
section
2
claim.
now
clearly
that
10
percent
competitor
cannot
monopolize
the
market,
but--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--excuse
me,
my
light
is
on.
mr.
james
d.
vail
thank
you.
mr.
james
d.
vail
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
justice,
i
understand
the
question--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--as
i
understand
the
question,
it
was
whether
or
not
a
defendant
in
the
ninth
circuit
had
the
ability
to
rebut
the
lessig
presumption
by
offering
evidence
that
it
did
not
possess
market
share
or
market
power.
is
that...
if
that's
the
question,
i
think
that
certain
panels
in
the
ninth
circuit
do
permit
that.
the
ninth
circuit
jurisprudence
is
certainly
confused
from
time
to
time
from
one
panel
to
the
next,
but
i
would
say
that,
on
balance,
yes,
the
ninth
circuit
would
permit
that
presumption,
it
would
permit
that
rebuttal.
mr.
james
d.
vail
the...
the
instruction...
first
of
all,
i
think
jurors
could
not
distinguish.
but
forgetting
the
facts
for
the
moment,
i
think
the
instructions
simply
permitted
the
jury
to
rely
on...
to
rely
on
conduct
to
reach
dangerous
probability.
in
this
case
it
was
not...
there
was
no
instruction
to
that
effect.
mr.
james
d.
vail
there
was
extensive
evidence
presented
on
behalf
of
the
defense
to
the
effect
that
this
was
an
extremely
competitive
market
with
no
barriers
to
entry,
yet
the
verdict
was
against
the
defense.
mr.
james
d.
vail
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
vail
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
vail
there
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
vail
we
asked
for
an
oahu
gas
instruction
which
allows
the
jury
to
look
at
procompetitive
justifications
of
conduct
as
well
as
anticompetitive
analysis,
and
that
was
objected
to
by
the
respondents
and
the
instruction
did
not
go
in.
one
of
the
key
points
or
key
problems
with
the
lessig
rule
is
that
it
is
so
difficult
to
determine
what
is
predatory
and
what
is
not
predatory
in
any
particular
situation,
that
the
dangerous
probability
requirement
is
there
as
a
safeguard
to
make
sure
that
this
is
not...
that
the
challenged
conduct
is
not
simply
conduct
done
for
personal
motives.
and
it
becomes
very
important
in
a
section
2
case
because
section...
we
are
trying
to
promote
competition
and
certainly
the
competitor
who
feels
harmed
or
who
has
lost
market
share
may
believe
that
to
be
for
predatory
reasons
or
unfair
reasons.
but
nonetheless,
that
such
conduct
does
not
implicate
the
antitrust
laws.
lastly,
i'd
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
lessig
rule
engenders
unnecessary
litigation,
a
bushel-load,
if
you
will,
of
litigation
in
the
ninth
circuit,
because
of
the
enticement
of
treble
damages
and
attorney's
fees.
and
it
has
such
a
chilling
effect
on
competition
that
it...
it
really
should
not
be
permitted
to
stand.
i
think
that
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
d.
vail
thank
you.
mr.
james
d.
vail
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
to
clean
up
a
couple
of
matters
in
the
record.
one
is
we
have
to
remember
that
there
was
no
price
fixing,
the
jury
found
it
wasn't
price
fixing,
that's
the
starting
point.
second,
there
was
a
variety
of
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the...
there
was
competition
in
the
market
and
what
the
market
was.
but
mr.
shohet
really
put
the
question
very
well.
he
said,
do
we
really
need
to
know
what
power
a
defendant
has
in
the
market,
is
that
really
something
we
need
to
know.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
the
court
has
said
it's
yes,
and
it
makes
intuitive
sense.
we're
concerned
in
section
2
about
monopolization,
and
if
a
defendant
doesn't
have
the
possibility
or
the
reasonable
probability
of
monopolizing,
we're
simply
not
concerned
with
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
james
d.
vail
your
honor,
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
simply,
this
is
the
first
time
this
has
been
raised.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
i'd
be
happy
to
submit
that
by
letter.
mr.
james
d.
vail
i
think
that
it
requires
a
conspiracy
of
more
than
one
person
agreeing
that
they
are
going
to
attempt
to
monopolize,
and
ought
to
have
dangerous
probability,
require
dangerous
probability.
if
attempt
requires
dangerous
probability,
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize
requires
it
also.
mr.
james
d.
vail
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
did
not
come
prepared
to
argue
conspiracy;
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
attempt
to
monopolize.
and
i...
i
simply
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
james
d.
vail
i
think
the
conspiracy
case
is
closed.
i
think--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
vail
well,
that
is
the
sunkist
growers
case,
which
says
that
when
there's
a
legal--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--sun--
mr.
james
d.
vail
--if
you'll
bear
with
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
vail
sunkist
stands
as
the
rule
of
this
court.
mr.
james
d.
vail
well,
there
are...
there
are
general
verdicts
in
criminal
cases
where
we
would
talk
about
factual
problems,
but
i
believe
sunkist
stands
as
the
rule
of
this
court
in
a
general
verdict
where
one
of
the
issues...
where
there's
a
legal
error
as
to
one
of
the
issues.
i
think
the
whole
issue
must
go
back,
that's
correct.
the
key
is
we're
talking
about
section
2
and
we
don't
want
to
chill
competition,
we
don't
want
to
chill
aggressive
competitors.
and
that
one
person
may
think
that
they've
been
harmed
and
it's
unfair
or
predatory,
we
don't...
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
person
could
ever
monopolize,
and
there's
no
advantage,
there's
no
unmet
need
that
requires
the
lessig
rule.
the
other
circuits
have
functioned
perfectly
well.
there
are
tort
law
remedies
available.
the
problem
with
lessig
is
that
it
allows
defendants
who
have
no
possibility
of
monopolizing
to
be
caught
in
the
antitrust
web
and
brought
down,
and
that
simply
isn't
the
purpose
of
the
sherman
act.
thank
you,
your
honor.
