justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
that
because
there
are
two
steps?
it
takes
the
act
and
it
infers
the
intent,
and
then
from
the
intent
it
infers
dangerous
probability.
is
that
how
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--chain
of
inferences
works,
in
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
jury
instructed
in
line
with
justice
stevens'
questions,
that
the
defendant
could
rebut
the
inference,
or
was
there
an
instruction
on
that
point
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
ask
for
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
definition
of
attempt,
for
purposes
of
section
2,
is
much
more
restrictive
than
the
definition
of
attempt
to
commit
crimes
generally,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
advocate
that
as
to
crimes
generally,
including--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--crimes
that
can
lead
to
a
rico
prosecution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
allege
a
violation
of
section
1?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but,
except
in
your...
in
your
brief
you
said:
should
the
court
find
error
in
the
instruction
on
attempt
to
monopolize,
it
should
remand
the
general
verdict
to
the
ninth
circuit.
