mr.
vail,
are
you...
are
you
challenging
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
we
agree
with
you
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court
to
be
tried
under
different
instructions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-hum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
object
to
the
jury
instructions
in
the
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
you
raise
the
jury
instruction
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
long,
if
certain
conduct
would
be
held
to
be
per
se
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
would
an
attempt
to
commit
that
act
require
the
kind
of
proof
you
say
it
does
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
attempt
to
commit
a
per
se
violation.
