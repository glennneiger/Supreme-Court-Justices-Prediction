mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
a
question
justice
white
asked
which
i
think
raises
the
most
important
issue
in
this
case
to
the
proper
resolution
of
it,
and
that
is
was
there
a
conspiracy,
was
there
concerted
activity
underlying
the
section
2
claim
here.
and
the
answer
is
yes.
we
can
tell
from
this
record,
and
it
cannot
be
disputed,
that
the
only
section
2
conduct
that
connects
this
petitioner
to
the
damage
alleged
was
conspiratorial
conduct.
in
fact,
it
was
a
price-fixing
agreement
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act...
i'm
sorry,
price-fixing
agreement
that
is
a
per
se
violation
of
section
1.
since--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--we
did,
and
there
was
a...
a
problem
with
the
jury
instruction,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
which
we
believe
explains
why
the
jury
did
not
find
liability
under
section
1.
but
whatever
the
jury
did,
it
must
have
based
its
section
2
verdict
on
conspiratorial
conduct.
it
was
the
only
conduct...
spectrum
points
out
that
it
had
no
power
to
terminate
this
distributorship.
that
power
was
with
the
manufacturer,
so
the
only
way
you
get
there
is
through
conspiratorial
conduct.
that
raises
a
very
important
point,
and
that
is
this.
the
controversial
lessig
inference
isn't...
should...
does
not
have
to
be
reached
in
this
case,
because,
as
the
solicitor
general
correctly
pointed
out,
when
you
have--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--i'm
saying
this.
yes,
i
can...
i
am
defending
it,
but
i'm
saying
it's
superfluous.
and
the
reason
is
each
of
the
elements
of
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize
are
identical
to
the
attempt
defense,
with
the
exception
that
the
attempt
defense
requires
a
dangerous
probability.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
understand.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
okay.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
will.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
will.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
wanted
to
make
that
very
important
point,
but
the...
but
the
next
point
that
follows
from
that
conclusion
is
this
was
a
very
limited
and
narrow
application
of
the
ninth
circuit's
rule.
it
was
not
based
upon
merely
unfair
or
unkind
conduct.
it
was
based
on
a
very--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
absolutely,
does
not.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well,
they...
the
instructions
on
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize
in
this
case
were
proposed
by
the
petitioners
and
specifically
exclude
the
dangerous--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--i
believe
there
is
authority.
i
don't
have
it
at
the
tip
of
my...
i
don't
have
it
right
here
today,
but
i
believe
there
is
authority
for
the
proposition.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
think
there's
some...
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
that
question,
justice
stevens.
some
circuits
have
said
that
it
does
not,
some
say
that
it
is
an
element.
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--the
specific
intent
requirement
is...
all
circuits
say
specific
intent
is
an
element,
yes,
but
not
a
dangerous--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--i
didn't
come
prepared
to
address
the
conspiracy
claim,
except...
except
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
stipulated
in
the
instructions
here.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i'm
not
aware
of
any
authority,
certainly,
from
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
but,
of
course,
because
it's
conspiratorial
conduct,
then
the
harm
inures
from
the
fact,
as
this
court
has
said
over
and
over,
that
when
people
join
together
to
accomplish
an
objective
forbidden
under
the
antitrust
laws
that
that,
in
and
of
itself,
creates
a
danger
beyond
the
unilateral
conduct
of
one
firm.
and
so
my
point
would
be
that
because
of
the
inherent
danger
of
a
conspiracy,
it
should
dispense
with
the
dangerous
probability
requirement--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--for
the
conspiracy
offense.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
think
it
is.
i
do
think
it
is,
sir.
because,
again,
the
specific...
the
jury
had
to
find
conspiratorial
conduct
to
get
to
either
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize
claim
or
the
attempt
to
monopolize.
it
had
to
find
specific
intent
for
both.
so
if
we
find...
if
we
can
determine
that
the
conspiratorial
conduct
was
the
basis
for
the
section
2
offense,
we
don't
reach
the
dangerous
probability
element
unless
you
make
dangerous
probability
an
element
of
a
conspiracy
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
am.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
true.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i've...
i've...
i've
relied
on
the...
i've
relied
simply
on
the
fact
that
there's...
that
the
conspiracy
instructions
were
stipulated
to
be
correct,
they
were
proposed
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
and
there
was
no
suggestion
of
error
in
the
conspiracy
instruction.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
so
we
should
be
affirmed
on
the
conspiracy
instruction,
it
would
seem,
if
dangerous
probability
is
not
an
element.
i'd
like
to
explain
and
go
through
why
we
can
determine
from
this
record
that
the
only
conduct
underlying
the
section--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
that...
that
issue
could
be
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit.
i
had
assumed
this
court
was
not
intending
to
go
through
and
affirm
the
conspiracy
verdict.
i
simply
wanted
to
alert
the
court
to
the
fact
that
this
verdict
stands
irrespective
of
the
court's
view
on
the
dangerous
probability
inference
of
the
ninth
circuit
because
of
the
nature
of
the
underlying
conduct,
and
that
is
concerted
conduct.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
not
if
it...
it
simply
adds
a
superfluous
requirement
that
is
not
inherent
in
the
conspiracy.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well,
my
point
is
to
get
to
the
lessig
claim,
justice
white,
they
had
to
find
each
of
the
elements
of
the
conspiracy
claim,
plus
dangerous
probability.
so
if
dangerous
probability
is
only
a
requirement
for
unilateral
conduct...
i
mean,
after
all,
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
is
an
attempt
to
monopolize
by
two
people
or
more
with
a
specific
intent
to
do
so.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well,
the
answer
is
because
we
know.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
if
we
could...
if
we
assume
that
it
was
simply
based
on
unilateral
conduct,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
but
we
know
in
this
case
it
was
based
on
concerted
conduct,
a
price-fixing
agreement,
because
that
was
the
only
anticompetitive
conduct
alleged
against
this
petitioner
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
must
find
a
proximate
cause
to
the
anticompetitive
conduct
and
the
damage.
and
the
damage
in
this
case
was
the
termination.
the
only
damage
we
claimed
was
the
termination
of
the
right
to
distribute
sorbothane.
that
was...
the
jury
found
the
same
damage
on
each
and
every
antitrust
verdict,
so
the
jury
found
that
the
termination
of
the
distributor
rights
was
the
damage
that
led
to
the
verdict.
that
damage
was...
that
termination
was
in
concert
with
the
manufacturer.
spectrum
had
no
ability,
by
himself,
by
itself,
to
do
that
conduct.
moreover,
the
jury
found
in
the
section
1
case
against
the
other
petitioner,
the
manufacturer,
liability
on
the
resale
price
maintenance
claim.
and
the
only
reason
resale
price
maintenance
was
not
found
against
this
petitioner
was
a
quirk
in
the
jury
instruction,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that.
the...
the...
a
central
part
of
the
petition
was
that
because
the
petitioner
was
exonerated
of
the
section
1
claim,
that
it
had
to
have
been
based,
the
section
2
verdict
had
to
have
been
based
on
this
general
unfair,
unkind
conduct.
the
resale
price
maintenance
instruction,
which
is
reported
at
page
4328
of
the
reporter's
transcript,
explains
quite
clearly
how
the
jury
found
the
section
2
verdict,
which
could
only
have
been
supported
on
a
connection
with
this
petitioner
to
the
price
fixing
agreement,
yet
exonerated
the
petitioner
on
the
section
1
claim.
that
jury
was
not...
that
jury
instruction
was
not
in
error,
but
it
needlessly
limited
the
section
1
offense
to
a
defendant
and...
to
an
agreement,
excuse
me,
between
a
defendant
and
a
distributor
of
the
defendant's.
this
petitioner
was
a
defendant,
but
it
did
not
enter
into
an
agreement
with
a
distributor
of
itself.
its
agreement
was
with
the
manufacturer.
so
the
manufacturer
was
found
liable
but
petitioner
was
not,
because
of
a
careful
following
of
the
instruction
by
the
jury.
but
that
certainly
does
not
mean
that
the
conduct
underlying
that
price
fixing
agreement
was
not
conduct
from
which
the
jury
could
have
and
must
have
found
the
section
2
liability.
so,
again,
we
say
it
was
a
specific
narrow
application
of
the
ninth
circuit's
attempt
rule
because
it
was
predicated
on
per
se
unlawful
conduct,
which,
as
justice
connor...
o'connor
pointed
out,
is
always
manifestly
harmful
to
competition,
is
never
justified,
and
therefore
is
a
proper
basis
from
which
the
inference
of
specific
intent
required
for,
at
least,
the
conspiracy
charge,
and
the
attempt
charge,
is
proper.
and
we
would
submit,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
is
also
a
proper
basis
from
which
an
inference
of
dangerous
probability
should
flow.
indeed,
on
that
point,
the
point
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
on,
the
issue
presented
is
whether
in
every
section
2
case,
in
every
attempt
to
monopolize
case,
congress
intended
the
separate
offense
of
attempt
to
monopolize
to
require,
as
a
threshold
matter
in
every
situation,
a
market
analysis
showing
virtual
monopolization,
or
whether,
as
the
ninth
circuit
provides,
in
some
limited,
very
narrow
class
of
cases
where
the
conduct
is
manifestly
anticompetitive
and
without
legitimate
procompetitive
justification.
we
can
pick
up
on
justice
holmes'
comment
in
the
swift
premium
case
and
conclude,
without
a
market
share
screen,
that
the
specific
intent
and
consequent
dangerous
probability
exists.
there
is
no
case...
and
the
walker
process
case,
justice
scalia,
does
not
address
the
dangerous
probability
element.
it
merely
recites
that
it's
an
element
without
any
analysis,
goes
on
to
say
that
further
development
in
the
record
below
needs
to
be
done
in
order
to...
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
should
be
a
per
se
offense
under
section
2.
so
it
really
leaves
the
question
open,
if
it
does
anything.
so
the
issue
of
whether
there's
a
dangerous
probability
element
at
all
in
the
attempt
defense,
or
how
we
should
properly
prove
it,
is
certainly
an
issue
that
this
court
is
now
addressing,
essentially,
for
the
first
time
since
1905.
the
ninth
circuit
rule...
i
might
also
add,
the
screen
that
the...
the
solicitor
general
proposes,
which
is
the
market
power
screen,
is
going
to
give...
is
not
only
an
expensive
impediment
and
a
needless
one,
but
it's
going
to
give
us
false
pos...
false
negative
results
in
many
cases.
in
the
circumstance
where
a
proposed
monopolist
who
has
the
specific
intent,
as
justice
holmes
said,
to
acquire
that
power,
is
engaging
in
conduct
before
he
has
done
significant
harm
to
the
markets,
the
screen
will
show
a
false
negative
if
we
conduct
our
market
power
screen,
and
assuming
we
can
do
it
perfectly...
assuming
we
can
do
it
perfectly--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--i
would
say
no,
justice
rehnquist,
for
this
reason,
although
it
is
certainly
a
very
important
and
complex
question.
i
would
say
that
market
definition
where
conduct
is
plainly
anticompetitive,
without
justification,
market
definition
should
be
left
to
the
defendant
to
justify
that
conduct.
that
the
jury
can
properly
infer
when
someone
appears
to
be
acting
with
the
specific
intent
to
harm
the
markets
and
has
no
legitimate
procompetitive
justification
for
engaging
in
that
conduct,
that
he
is
harming
a
market,
a
relevant
market.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well,
it
is
a
little
like
that,
justice
rehnquist,
but
it's
a
little
different
than
that
as
well.
and
it's
different
because,
again,
if
we
accept
justice
holmes'
definition
of
the
attempt
defense,
that
when
we
have
specific
intent
combined
with
dangerous
probability
we
have
dangerous
conduct.
now
i
would
agree
with...
with
your
honor
that,
in
fact,
no
harm
to...
can
occur
except
in
a
relevant
market.
i
accept
that
and
we
did
allege
a
relevant
market
and
we
put
in
evidence
of
the
relevant
market.
but
my
point
is
it's
sort
of
a
burden-shifting
issue.
once
you
show
the
plainly
anticompetitive
conduct,
why
not
shift
the
responsibility
to
the
defendant
to
then
define
the
market?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
true.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
because
the
reason
is...
the
reason
is
because
we
have
plainly
anticompetitive
conduct
that
is
always
harmful...
in
this
case
per
se
unlawful
under
section
1,
that
is
always
harmful
to
the
markets
and
never
justified.
and
the
ninth...
the
wisdom
of
the
ninth
circuit,
if
there
is
any,
it
says
in
that
circumstance
we're
going
to
permit
but
not
require
an
inference
from
the
very
conduct
that
is
inconsistent
with
an
intent
other
than
to
harm
the
markets.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well,
we
can
simply...
we
can
look
at
the...
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
can
look
at
the
conduct
and
say
where
it
is
inconsistent
with
an
intent
other
than
to
hurt
the
markets
and
where
it
is...
makes
sense
only
in
furtherance
of
the
acquisition
of
market
power
by
a...
by
a
single
firm--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--or
in
concert.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--well,
the
point
is--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--as
a
matter
of
policy,
should
we
let
some
big...
some
of
the
big
monopolist
fish
through
the
net
simply
because
we
may
catch
a
few
people
who
have
the
specific
intent
to
hurt
the
market
but
are
just
very
ineffective
at
doing
so
or
have
no
realistic
hope
of...
of
accomplishing
their
purpose?
that's
the
policy
question
on
the
table.
because
if
justice
holmes'
view
of
the...
of
the
attempt
defense
is
correct,
the
specific
intent
combined
with
the
exclusionary
conduct
creates
the
danger
to
the
market.
and
i
might
add,
the
market
power
screen
is
a
very
imperfect
test
because
it's
not
going
to
produce
a
positive
result
until
a
lot
of
the
harm
has
already
occurred
to
those
markets
through
that
exclusionary
conduct.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
if
you
accept...
i
mean,
if
the
definition
of
the
dangerous
probability
is
intent
plus
conduct,
the
moment
i
take
that
first
step
to
predatorily
price
or
fix
prices,
i'm
down
the
road
in
a
very
dangerous
path.
but
until
i
have
eliminated
a
substantial
amount
of
competition
with
the
restraint,
i
have
not
developed
significant
market
share.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
well,
the
person--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--i
say
they're
either
monopolists
or
they're...
or
they're
not
very
smart.
but
either
way,
the
per
se
rules
condemn
it,
and
not
because
the
per
se
rules
don't
address
harm
to
competition,
but
because
the
per
se
rules
presume
that
that
kind
of
conduct
always
hurts
competition
to
some
degree
and
is
never
justified.
and
what
we're
saying
here
is
the
underlying...
facts
underlying
this
case
was
per
se
unlawful.
so
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--correct.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
we
contend
in
this
case
that...
that
the
record
demonstrates
that
that's
precisely
what
we
have,
conspiratorial
per
se
conduct,
that
conduct
being
an
agreement
in
january
of
'82
to
fix
prices,
that
the
wholesalers
would
resell
the
product
to
their
retailers,
an
agreement
on
their
part
to
set
up
resale
price
maintenance
agreements
with
their
retailers
and
an
agreement
to
police
those
retailers
to
eliminate
any
price
cutting
or
discounting
by
those
retailers.
a
particularly
pernicious
form
of
resale
price
maintenance,
particularly
where
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
no
interbrand
competition
or
little
interbrand
competition.
so
what
we
had
is
the
setting
up
of
a
small
cartel
here
so
that
at
each
level
the
price
points
were
kept
high,
the
retailers
were
enjoying
no
competition
between
each
other
and
so
they
would
devote
shelf
space
to
this
product,
and...
and
truly
injure
competition.
now
there's
a
raging
debate
between
the
economists
as
to
whether
resale
price
maintenance
should
or
should
not
be
unlawful.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
in
this
case,
this
is
the
most
pernicious
and
extreme
version
of
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
it's
a
case
of
resale
price
maintenance.
there
was
direct
evidence
of
the
agreement--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--in
june...
in
january
of
'82
the
agreement
that
was
made
was
that
we
would
have
to
appoint
a
single
national
distributor,
spectrum
sports,
in
order
to
effectively
carry
out
the
resale
price
maintenance
scheme.
the
regional
distributors,
including
my
client,
were
not
being
effective
at
policing
the
retailers
to
keep
the
price
cutting
down.
and
was...
and
it
was
direct
evidence
by
the
marketing
manger
of
the
defendant
hamilton
kent,
the
other
petitioner,
that
the
termination
was
agreed
to
be
done
at
that
meeting
in
furtherance
of
the
carrying
out
of
the
price
fixing.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
we
didn't
do
it
as
well
as
petitioner
did.
the
evidence
was
that
petitioner
was
a
very
effective
and
enthusiastic
enforcer,
and
that
was
from
the
other
defendant,
not...
not...
that
was
direct
evidence
of
a
meeting,
that
he
would
slow
down
shipments
to
the
retailers
to
keep
them
from
cutting
the
price,
and
that
he
was
doing
quite
a
good
job.
it
also
has
a
horizontal
component
to
it
because
the
specific
meeting
testified
to
by
the...
the...
the
marketing
manager
was
called
by
the
other
national
distributor
of
medical
products,
and
the
testimony
was
that
it
was
in
furtherance
of
an
understanding
to
keep
the
price
points
in
the
medical
market
high
to
keep
the
price
up
in
the
athletic
market,
so
that
there
was
not
a
lot
of
competition.
there
was
testimony
that
the...
if
there
was
price
cutting,
the...
the
retail...
the
medical
retailers
could
go
out
and
purchase
the
same
product
in
the
athletic
stores
for
less
than
they...
for
less
than
they
were
getting
it
from
the
manufacturer.
so
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
of
what
the
conduct
was
in
this
case,
and
it
was
quite
harmful
and...
and...
and
always
anticompetitive,
never
procompetitive.
and
the
quirk
that
brings
us
here
is
that
the...
the...
the...
the
section
1
instruction
was
drafted
in
such
a
way,
with...
with
focus
on
the
manufacturer
rather
than
the
distributor,
so
that
there...
the
jury
properly
found
no
liability
under
section
1.
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
and
the
attempt
defense,
just
to...
to
focus
exactly
what
it
did
and
what
it
did
in
this
case.
there
are
three
prongs
to
the
section
2
attempt
approach
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
one
that
was
applied
in
this
case
was
the
conduct
that
is
per
se
unlawful
under
section
1.
indeed,
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case,
and
it
was
instruction
number...
it's
reported
at
page
440
of
the
supplemental
appendix,
said
that
our
attempt
claim
was
limited
to
the
exclusionary
conduct
alleged
to
violate
section
1.
so
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
exclusionary
conduct
in
this
case
was
limited
by
our
own
claim
as
set
forth
in
the
instruction
to
the
section
1
conduct.
there's
been
some
criticism
that
i'd
like
to
address,
and
that
is
that
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
collapses
the
distinction
between
section
1
and
section
2
and
permits...
and
commits...
permits
liability
under
section
2
without
a
manifest
harm
to
the
markets.
first,
with
respect
to
the
distinction
between
section
1
and
section
2.
there
is
no
distinction
between
section
1
and
section
2
based
on
unilateral
versus
concerted
activity.
section
2,
in
fact,
includes
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize
offense.
so
section
2
has
concerted
activity
within
its
proscription
in
the
statute.
so
to
suggest
that
there
was
some
intent
by
congress
to
limit
section
2
only
to
unilateral
conduct
belies
the
statute.
moreover,
what
section
2
does
address
itself
to
is
unilateral
and
joint
conduct
in
furtherance
of
monopoly
power
or
in
the...
the
acquisition
and
maintenance
of
monopoly
power
already
held,
the
maintenance
of
monopoly
power
already
held.
some
of
the
most
effective
monopolists
and
people
who
are
attempting
to
monopolize
are
going
to
do
that
through
joint
conduct.
joint
conduct
is
the
most
harmful
conduct
to
the
markets,
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
court
to
develop
a
rule
that
simply
writes
joint
conduct
out
of
section
2.
indeed,
it
can't
write
a
rule
writing
joint
conduct
out
of
section
2
because
the
conspiracy
offense
is
in
section
2.
moreover,
one
would...
i've
heard
criticism
that
if
the...
if
the...
if
the...
if
there's
a
violation
of
section
1,
why
have
an
attempt
defense
predicated
on
a
per
se
offense
under
section
1?
well,
this
case
is
one
example
of
why
to
do
that.
but
i
think
justice
o'connor
made
a
good
point
which
is
that
the
unconsummated
section
1
agreement,
and
a
good
example
of
that
was
in
the
american
airlines
case
where
you'll
recall
the
president
of
american
called
his
counterpoint
at
braniff
and
said
let's
fix
prices,
this
is
killing
us,
this
dangerous
cutthroat
competition
in
the
airline
industry
is
driving
us
all
crazy.
and
the
braniff
president
promptly
hung
up
and
called
the
justice
department.
the
fact
is
that
if
a
private
litigant
was
either...
was
injured
by
that
act
or
was
threatened
by
that
act
and
sought
an
injunction
against
it,
that
litigant
ought
to
be
able
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
seek
an
injunction
under
section
2
without
a
showing
of
market
power.
is
there
any
question
that
we
really
need
to
know
anything
about
the
market
power
of
either
the
individuals
or
their
combined
market
power
after
the...
the
agreement
would
have
been
consummated
before
we're
ready
to
condemn
that
conduct
as
threatening
monopolization?
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
i
think
it
would,
justice
stevens,
because
in
that
circumstance,
without
knowing
the
market
share,
we
know
one
thing,
it's
always--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--which
is
always
anticompetitive
and
never
justified.
so
the
rule...
remember,
the
policy--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--no.
the
ninth
circuit
has
thrown
out
implausible
section
1
offenses.
there's
the...
i
think
it's
the
rickards
case,
there
are
one
or
two
ninth
circuit
cases
where
it's
come
up
where
there
has
been
a
section...
the
knudsen
case
where
there
was
a
technical
violation
of
section
1,
yet
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
was
implausible
to
infer
from
that
section
1
violation
an
intent
to
monopolize.
but
i
would
say
it's
a
good
starting
point,
where
there's
a
section
1
violation.
but
to
answer
your
specific
question,
where
there's
a
price
fixing
proposal
on
the
table,
i
would
submit
that
it's
a
sensible
rule
that
rather
than
require
a
market
screen
and
all
of
the
complexity
and
difficulty
of
market
definition
and
proof,
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
in
that
case
it
is
likely...
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
specific
intent
and
dangerous
probability.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
right.
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
except
to
bring
it
under
section
2,
you
impose
on
yourself
an
additional
screen
of
specific
intent,
which
is
not
present
under
section
1,
and
it's
a
mere
inference,
not
a
rebuttable
presumption.
so
to
use
mr.
vail's
example
of
the
80
percent
market
share
defendant,
they're
permitted
to
come
forward
and
presumably
that
would
go
out
on
summary
judgment
because
the
court
would
screen
that
case
right
out,
and
saying
it's
totally
implausible
for
there
to
be
any
harm
to
competition.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
has
not
eliminated
the
dangerous
probability
element
and
it's
still
a
good
and
viable
element
under
section
2
in
the
ninth
circuit.
it
merely
limits
to
a
very
narrow
case.
in
most
cases,
and
the
case
law
under
the
ninth
circuit
established
this...
in
most
cases
there
is
a
requirement
for
a
market
analysis
because
we
can't
know
that
it's
dangerous,
we
can't
form
a
judgment
about
it
in
the
ambiguous
conduct.
but
where
the
conduct
is
unambiguous,
why
throw
the
plaintiff
out
on
the
street
for
lack
of
a
market
analysis
when
we
can
start
with
the
inference
that
there
is
market
danger
and
intent,
and
shift
over
to
the
defendant
to
put
on
all
the
market
evidence
it
wants.
and,
indeed,
on
a
summary
judgment,
if
there's
a
significant
implausibility
factor
to
that
position
of
the
plaintiff,
these
cases
are
not
going
to
go
to
the
jury.
and
the
ninth
circuit
jurisprudence
in
the
last
10
years
reflects
that
most
of
these
cases
are
thrown
out
because
they
reflect
ambiguous
conduct
or
because
they're...
they're--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--true,
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
intent
issue
is
not
the
controversial
part
of
the
ninth
circuit.
every
circuit
permits
an
inference
of
intent
from
conduct.
it's
the
dangerous
probability
inference
that's
controversial
in
this
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
how
else
do
you
prove
specific
intent
but
as
an
inference
from
conduct?
you
can
have
direct
evidence
through
admissions,
but
that's
still
an
inference
from
conduct.
we
can't
open
people's
minds
and
know
what
their
intent
is.
but
that's
not
the
controversial
part
of
the
case
before
the
court.
the
controversial
part
is
the
inference
of
dangerous
probability
from
that
conduct.
i'd
like
to
conclude...
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
before
i
conclude
that
the
other
instruction...
our
instructions
in
this
case
demonstrated
and
reflected
that
balance,
because
they
were
limited
to
the
section
1
conduct
and
they
required
the
jury
to...
they
told
the
jury
that
you
may
infer,
but
need
not
infer,
this
dangerous
probability
from
significantly
exclusionary
conduct
that
is
destructive
of
competition
and
plainly
harmful
to
competition.
it
specifically
admonished
the
jury
that
it
could
not
make
such
an
inference
from
conduct
that
results
from
the
introduction
of
a
superior
product,
lower
costs,
or
better
business
judgment,
or
hard
competition.
so
the
policy
inherent
in
the
dangerous
probability
element,
to
protect
legitimate
competition,
to
protect
against
the
incursion
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
legitimate
business...
which
is
why
we
go
through
dangerous
probability
screens
and
why
we're
so
concerned
with
the
conduct,
making
sure
it
harms
competition,
not
competitors...
is
to
protect
legitimate
competition,
which
is
not
at
risk
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule
because
the
ninth
circuit
limits
the
consideration
of
these
cases
to
conduct
that
has
no
procompetitive
justification.
we
are
not
putting
the
legitimate
businessperson
at
risk
in
adopting
the
ninth
circuit
approach.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
universal
rejection
of
lessig,
which
the
amicus
and
which
the
petitioner
refer
to
in
their
briefs,
is
a
universal
rejection
of
the
lessig
case
itself,
which
said
that
the
dangerous
probability
element
is
eliminated
or
is
not
an
element
in
the
case.
that
is
not
the
ninth
circuit's
rule.
the
ninth
circuit
has
made
it
very--
mr.
jeffrey
m.
shohet
--thank
you.
