justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
ninth
circuit
rule
foreclose
the
defendant
from
saying
even
though
you
can
raise
an
inference
of
dangerous
probability
by
proving
the
conduct,
that
the
defendant
can
put
in
evidence
that
he's...
that
he's
got
80
percent
of
the
market,
the
defendant
has
80
percent
of
the
market,
and
therefore
it's
absurd
to
think
that...
that
he
could
succeed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
lunch
time,
so
why
don't
you
answer
me
after
lunch.
yes,
you
can
answer
justice
stevens'
question
at
1:00.
we
will
resume
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
well,
how
do
you
explain
the
result
in
this
case,
then?
because...
is
there...
is
it
subject
to
reasonable...
could
reasonable
jurors
differ
on
whether
or
not
there...
there
was
a
dangerous
probability
of
success
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did...
but
did
the
defendant
put
in
evidence
that
this
is
kind
of
silly,
to
assume
a
dangerous
probability
when
we
have
such
a
small
percentage
of
the
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you...
before
you
leave
your
first
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
legal
position
that
even
though
the
offense
of
attempt
to
monopolize
requires
proof
of
a
dangerous
probability
of
success,
the
offense
of
conspiracy
to
monopolize
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
do
you
have
any...
any
authority
in
any
appellate
court
decision
that
draws
the
distinction
you
draw?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that
the...
my
own
understanding
of
the
law
was
a...
a
conspiracy
is
just
a
joint
attempt,
and
you
still
have...
you
still
have
to
have
the
other
elements
of
an
attempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
a
dangerous...
well,
but
you
don't
have
any
cases.
you're
just
telling
me
you
think
there
are
some
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
that's
not
what...
my
concern.
my
concern
is
whether
there's
any
authority
for
that
proposition,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
not
a
case,
then,
of
predatory
price
cutting
at
all,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did...
how
did
the
resale
price
maintenance
hurt
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
because
you
were
unable
to
keep
your
re...
your
customer's
prices
up,
yep.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument...
and
maybe
american
airlines
is
pretty
big,
but
say
it
was
some
local
airline,
and
i
can't
think
of
a
name
right...
of
any
right
now,
but
two
or
three
local...
one
calls
another
on
the
phone
that
way,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
section
2?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they...
they
wanted
to
fix
prices,
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
test
is,
any
attempt
to
engage
in
conduct
that
is
per
se
unlawful
under
section
1
is
a
violation
of
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
kind
of
interesting
because
your
theory
would
really
create
an
attempt
defense
in
section
1.
an
attempt
to
engage
in,
at
least,
the
worst
kinds
of
section
1
violations
would
be
unlawful--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
unlawful
under
section
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
your
instruction
on
conspiracy
to
monopolize
that
you
tendered
to
the
court
did
not
require
proof
of
a
dangerous
probability?
