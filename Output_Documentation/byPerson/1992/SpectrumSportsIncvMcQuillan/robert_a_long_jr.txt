mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
liability
for
attempted
monopolization
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
should
be
limited
to
conduct
that
creates
a
realistic
probability
of
actual
monopolization.
the
probability
of
monopolization
can
be
determined
only
by
defining
a
relevant
market
and
considering
the
defendant's
conduct
in
the
context
of
that
market.
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
unlike
section
1,
applies
to
unilateral
conduct.
as
this
court
recognized
in
copperweld,
it
is
often
difficult
to
distinguish
robust
competition
from
unilateral
conduct
with
long-run
anticompetitive
effects.
vigorous
competition
may
seem
unfair
and
predatory
to
an
unsuccessful
competitor,
but
the
antitrust
laws
protect
competition,
not
competitors,
and
vigorous
competition
promotes
the
welfare
of
consumers.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
to
attempted
monopolization
brings
many
ordinary
business
torts
within
the
scope
of
the
sherman
act
with
its
treble
damages
remedy.
because
private
antitrust
actions
are
relatively
easy
to
bring
and
expensive
to
defend,
an
overexpansive
definition
of
the
attempt
defense
is
likely
to
chill
vigorous
competition.
nonantitrust
laws
are
more
appropriate
vehicles
for
remedying
single
firm
conduct
that
does
not
present
a
genuine
risk
of
injury
to
competition.
the
probability
of
monopolization
can
be
assessed
only
by
defining
a
relevant
market;
that
is,
a
market
in
which
a
monopolist
could
charge
a
price
above
the
competitive
price
for
a
significant
period
of
time.
in
general,
a
higher
market
share
increases
the
probability
of
market
power,
but
market
structure
is
also
relevant;
factors
such
as
barriers
to
entry
and
excess
capacity.
in
our
view,
the
probability
of
monopolization
generally
should
be
considered
as
a
threshold
issue
in
a
section
2
case.
if
it
is
clear
from
the
defendant's
market
position
that
there
is
no
significant
possibility
of
monopoly,
then
judgment
for
the
defendant
is
appropriate.
the
court
and
the
parties
can
thereby
avoid
costly
and
time-consuming
inquiries
into
specific
intent
and
conduct.
i
should
add--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
when
there's
a
dangerous
probability
of
success.
that's
the
formulation
this
court
adopted
in
swift
&
company
and...
and
that
is
the
standard
we
think
the
court
should
reaffirm
in
this
case.
obviously--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--typically,
we
think
you
must
define
a
relevant
market
and
then
make
some--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no,
specific
intent
is
also
an
element
of
attempt
to
monopolize,
that's...
that's
clear
from
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
aspen
skiing,
times-picayune,
swift
&
company,
a
number
of
this
court's
decisions
have
held
that
specific
intent--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well
the...
the
formulation
in
swift
&
company
is
dangerous
probability.
we
think--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--in...
yes.
and
that
is...
that
is
what
the
jury
should
be
instructed
to
find,
and
we
think
that
mere
evidence
of
conduct,
of
unilateral
conduct,
cannot
be
a
sufficient
basis
to
infer
the
dangerous
probability
of
success.
because
unilateral
conduct
is
so
difficult
to
characterize,
so
much
conduct
that
might
be
claimed
to
be
predatory
is
actually
just
vigorous
competition.
predatory
pricing
is
a
good
example
of
that.
cutting
price
is
a
classic
means
of
competing.
it's
generally
good
for
consumers.
it's
very
difficult
to
tell
when
a
price
is
predatory
or--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
in
our
view--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
don't
think
so.
in
our
view,
there
should
not
be
a
category
of
per
se
section
2
violations.
the...
leading
commentators
areeda
and
turner
have
suggested
there
should
be
a
very
narrow
category,
and
not
anything
like
any
behavior
that's
been
alleged
in
this
case.
predatory
pricing,
fraudulent
procurement
of
a
patent,
are
the
two
leading
examples
they
give.
the
court
need
not
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
it's...
it's
not
presented.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
true,
although
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
the
court
added:
not
every
act
that
may
be
done
with
intent
to
produce
an
unlawful
result
is
unlawful
or
constitutes
an
attempt.
it
is
a
question
of
proximity
and
degree.
that's
at
page
402
of
the
opinion.
in
the
walker
process
case,
i
think,
also,
justice
scalia,
the
court
held
that
a
dangerous
prox...
probability
of
success--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
a
higher
market
share,
in
general,
does
indicate
a
greater
probability
of
successful
monopolization.
we
emphasize
though,
that's
not
the
sole
test.
you
have
to
consider
the
structure
of
the
market;
if
barriers
to
entry,
for
example,
would
be
relevant.
in
some
cases
a
defendant
with
a
relatively
low
market
share
could
be
capable
of
monopolizing.
there
could
be
a
dangerous
probability
if,
for
example,
there
were
high
barriers
to
entry.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
the
walker
process
case.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it's
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
10,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
not
at
all.
we
think
that's
the
basic
distinction.
joint
conduct
does
present
a
significant
danger
of
anticompetitive--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--your
honor,
to
my
knowledge
there
was
not
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
claim.
the...
the
particular
claim
in
front
of
us
was
a
general
verdict.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
correct
myself,
i
misspoke.
there
was
a
general
verdict.
the
jury
was
instructed
to
find
the
defendants
liable
for
monopolizing,
attempting
to
monopolize,
or
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
they
found
them
liable
and
they
didn't
specify
which
of
those
three.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it's...
it
was...
it
was
subsumed--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--in
the
general
verdict.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
did
not.
it
said
that
it
could
affirm
if
it
could
find
sufficient
evidence
to
affirm
on
any
of
the
three
grounds,
and
it
only
addressed
attempt
to
monopolize.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
since
we
think
there
was
an
error
in
the
legal
instruction
on
attempt
and
since
the
jury
was
just
told...
just
returned
a
general
verdict,
we
think
the...
the
section
2
verdict
can't
stand.
this
is
under
sunkist
growers.
there
was
a
legal
mistake.
the
jury
can't
be
presumed
to
know
that
it
was
misinstructed
on
the
law,
and
since
there's
no
way
to
tell
that
the
general
verdict
didn't
rest
solely
on
the
attempt
claim,
we
think
that
the
section
2
verdict
cannot
stand.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct,
although
the
dangerous
proximity
approach
is
one
that
is
still
in
use
in
some
parts
of
the
criminal
law.
but
we...
we
certainly
don't
advocate
that
as
a
general
criminal
law
standard.
we
think
in
the
special
context
of
the
sherman
act,
which
is
both
a
civil
and
a
criminal
statute
with
a
treble
damages
remedy,
that
applying
something
like
the
model
penal
code,
the
substantial
step
requirement,
would
allow
too
many
ordinary
business
torts
to
be
swept
into
the
coverage
and
would
essentially
defeat
the
purpose
of
section
2
by
allowing,
actually,
a
chilling
of
vigorous
competition.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
certainly
not.
thank
you.
