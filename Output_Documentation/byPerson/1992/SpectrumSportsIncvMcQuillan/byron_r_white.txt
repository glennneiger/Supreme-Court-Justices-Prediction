justice
byron
r.

when
do
you
get
to...
when
do
you
get
to
being
guilty
of
an
attempt
but
not
monopolization?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
measure
that
by
examining
market
power,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
intent
irrelevant
in
the
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-hum.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
at
some
time
in
this
case
it
might
be
a
dangerous
possibility
or
probability,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
at
some...
some
time
in
this...
on
these...
in
this
very
situation,
there
might
arise
a
dangerous
probability.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
in
a
conspiracy
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
happened
to
the
conspiracy
claim
in
this
case?
the
jury
just
returned
a
general
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
who
has
a
conspiracy
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what...
and
what
happened
to
this
conspiracy
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
ninth
circuit--
justice
byron
r.
white
--did
the
ninth
circuit
deal
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
agree
with
you
and
petitioner,
are
those
issues
still...
is
the
issue
of
conspiracy
still
open
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be...
that
may
be
so,
but
if
we
were...
if
we
insist
on
reviewing
what
the
ninth
circuit
decided,
are
you
defending
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose
we...
suppose
we
decide
that
the
ninth
circuit
lessig
is...
case
is
wrong
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
applying
it
here.
what...
and
the
case
is
then...
that's
all
we
decide
and
we...
the
case
goes
back
to
the
ninth
circuit,
right?
is
the
conspiracy
issue
still
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what...
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
come
prepared
to
argue
the...
whether
a
specific...
whether
dangerous
probability
is
required
in
a
conspiracy
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there's
a
possibility
you
might
lose
in
this
case,
in
which
event
the
conspiracy
case,
you
say,
is
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah,
but
if
we
decide
there's
error
in
the...
in
the...
on
the...
one
of
the
three
claims,
namely
the
lessig
claim,
don't
you...
do
you
think
the
error
infects
the
entire
general
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
jury
might
have
decided
based
solely
on
the
lessig
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
jury
might
have
decided
that,
well,
why
get
mixed
up
with
conspiracy
and
all
that
stuff.
all
we
have
to
find
is
a...
is
some
conduct,
anticompetitive
conduct,
and...
and
a
bad
intent,
and
they
just
stop
right
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
what
their
general
verdict
is
based
on.
let's
just
assume
that's
what
they
did.
does
that
infect
the
entire
general
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you...
just
as
a
general
matter,
what
would
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's...
if...
if
we
agree
with
you,
but
the
case
goes
back
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
conspiracy
case
is
either
going
to
be
open
or
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
because
the
error,
it
would
infect
the
entire
general
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
cases
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
370,
u.s.--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
have
there
been
some
other
cases
since
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
not
in
antitrust
cases
maybe,
but
in
other
cases
about
general
verdicts.
