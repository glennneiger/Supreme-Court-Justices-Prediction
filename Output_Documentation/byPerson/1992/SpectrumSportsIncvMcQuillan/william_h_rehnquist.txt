justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-10,
spectrum
sports,
inc.
v.
shirley
mcquillan.
mr.
vail,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the...
was
the
jury
here
charged
that
in
order
to
find
the
defendant
liable
it
would
have
to
find
an
attempt
to
monopolize?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
did
the
ninth
circuit
say
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
an
attempt
to
monopolize?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
ninth
circuit
permits
an
inference
of
dangerous
probability
of
success
without
any
effort
having
been
made
to
define
the
market?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vail,
we'll
resume
where
we
left
off.
you
were
pondering
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
vail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
long,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
shohet,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
shohet,
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
the
question--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
was
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
certainly
want
to
hear
you
deal
with
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shohet,
supposing
we...
we
accept
your
submission
that
a
dangerous
probability
of
success
is
not
required
in
every
single
case,
but
wouldn't...
wouldn't
you
at
least
have
to
know
what
the...
what
the
defined
market
was
before
you
could
convict
someone
of
attempting
to
monopolize
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that...
that's
like
saying
in
a
criminal
prosecution
the
state
can
charge
you
with
attempt
to
murder
because
you
were
running
around
with
a
knife
without
saying
who
you
were
going
to
murder.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
all
of
the
elements
of
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
say
why
not
shift
it
to
the
defendant,
i
mean,
the
initial
inquiry
is
why
shift
it...
why
shift
it
to
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it's
a
question
of
a
permissible
inference
of
intent,
i
would
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
throw
many
of
them
out
on
summary
judgment.
because
intent
is
very
much
a
subjective
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shohet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vail,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
vail.
the
case
is
submitted.
