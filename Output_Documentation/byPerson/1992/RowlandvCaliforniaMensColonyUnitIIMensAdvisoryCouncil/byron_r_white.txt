justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
without
the
definition
of
person,
the
general
definition
of
person,
if
that
weren't
in
the
statutes,
i
suppose
you
would
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
don't
usually
call
a...
in
common
parlance,
you
wouldn't
call
a
corporation
a
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
word,
poverty,
in
the
statute
also
helps
you.
you
don't
usually
think
of
a
corporation
as
making
an
affidavit
of
poverty--
justice
byron
r.
white
--financial...
or
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
usually
refer
to
impoverished
corporations?
we
refer
to
corporations
with
financial
hardship,
corporations
that
are
insolvent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't
pin
much
on
the
term,
poverty,
in
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
a
bankrupt
corporation
that
is
bankrupt
because
it
can't
possibly
pay
its
debt,
its
assets
are
much
less
than
its
liabilities...
do
you
think
that
would
automatically
mean
that
it
could
be...
it
could
file
an
affidavit
that
is...
that
it
is
entitled
to
be
treated
as
a
pauper?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
corporation
might
have...
could
be
taking...
could
be
put
in
involuntary
bankruptcy
or
take
voluntary
bankruptcy
even
though
it
has
an
income
of
maybe
100,000
dollars
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
i
don't...
i
doubt
if
it
would
be
granted
in
forma
pauperis
status,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
one
and
three
different
of
these
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
plain
language
is
the
plain
language.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
part
of
the
plain
language,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
what
an
association
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
just
anybody
can
say...
a
bunch
of
neighbors
get
together
and
they
just
say
we
are
an
association?
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
have
to
recognize
that...
even
you
have
to
recognize
what
an
association
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
get
in
forma
pauperis
status.
and
it
would,
of
course,
mean
that
people,
for
instance,
landowners
wanting
to
fight
a
zoning
change,
could
form
an
association
and
not
fund
it
and
claim
indigent
status
and
get
a
lawyer
appointed.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it's
plain
the
association
hasn't
got
any
money,
but
it's
also
just
as
plain
that
the
members
of
it
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
only
look
to
the
association
exclusively
if
you
find
that
it
has
so
much
money
of
its
own
that
it
doesn't
deserve
in
forma
pauperis.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
doesn't
have
any
money,
then
you
look
to...
always
look
to
the
members.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
a
partnership
that
has
filed
its
articles
of
partnership
according
to
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
fortiori,
i
suppose
you
ought
to
look
to
the...
because
a
partnership
is
more
of
a...
is
treated
more
as
an
entity
in
more
circumstances
than
an
association
i
suppose.
and
yet,
you
say
look
to
the
assets
of
the
partners.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
the
committee
report
says
we
know
we've
used
the
word,
person,
in
this
statute,
but
we
have
no
intention
that
that
word,
person,
means
what
the
general
definition
of
person
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
another
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
legislative
history
has
to
say
that
in
order
to
make
a
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
it
would
be
a
much
harder
case
if
the
committee
report
said
we
don't
intend
to
apply
the
general
definition
of
person--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
we
don't
intend
to
include
associations
and
corporations.
and
you
said
that
would
make
a
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
a
different
rule.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
can't
be...
have
in
forma
pauperis
status.
all
it
means
is
that
you
can
have
it,
but
in
order
to
get
into
court,
you
got
to
have
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
bring
your
lawyer.
tell
your
lawyer
that
you're
broke
and
he
should--
--meet
you
at
the
courthouse.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
should
come
with
you.
well,
he
got
a
lawyer
here
without
the
help
of
the
court,
didn't
he?
or
was
he
appointed
by
the
court?
your
opponent.
