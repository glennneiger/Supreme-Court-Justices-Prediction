well,
mr.
ching,
weren't
corporations
considered
to
be
citizens
at
least
for
purposes
of
federal
court
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
mr.
ching,
in
this
instance,
if
we
have
an
association
of
prisoners
who
by...
i
guess
you
concede
they
individually
didn't
have
any
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--all
right.
let
me
ask
you
this.
could
the
action
have
been
brought
as
a
class
action
with
an
affidavit
of
indigency
by
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it
wouldn't
have
been
impossible
for
this
group
to
have
filed
on
an
indigent
basis,
in
effect,
through
the
mechanism
of
a
class
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
weisselberg,
i
suppose
that
under
the
old
original
statute
that
dealt
with
citizens
back
in
1892,
that
that
didn't
include
associations,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
a
corporation,
but
i
didn't...
didn't
the
old
dictionary
law
in
force
back
in
1892
make
clear
that
it
didn't
apply
to
associations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
we
take
it
on
the
assumption
that
citizen
then
at
least
didn't
include
an
association,
such
as
you're
representing.
so,
when
congress
changed
citizen
to
include
aliens,
presumably
it
didn't
enlarge
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
but
it
also
tells
us
to
look
at
the
context.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
the
context
tells
us
that
it
didn't
include
associations,
i
guess
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
weisselberg,
could
this
action
have
been
brought
as
a
class
action
and
affidavits
of
indigency
supplied
by
named
plaintiffs?
