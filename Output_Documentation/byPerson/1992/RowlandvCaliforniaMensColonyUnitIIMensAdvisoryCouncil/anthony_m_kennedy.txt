well,
it
would
have
been
rejected
in
the
second
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
we
know
whether
it
would
have
been
rejected
in
the
ninth
circuit,
for
example?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
really
the
first
definition
in
the
dictionary
is
that
it
is
a
connection
of
words
that...
excuse
me.
the
parts
of
a
discourse
that
surround
a
word
or
passage
and
can
throw
light
on
its
meaning.
so,
under
that
definition...
it's
the
first
definition...
it
would
indicate
that
we
look
just
to
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
now,
i
said
gist
of
the
statute.
that's
a
plausible
interpretation
of
context,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
counsel,
isn't
that...
isn't
there
a
danger
there
that
just
because
the
named
plaintiff
is
indigent,
could
he
bring
a
class
action
in
forma
pauperis
if
he
has
got
a
bunch
of
rockefellers
in
his
class?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
the...
but
then
he
sues
on
behalf
of
the
whole
class.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whereas
if
you
made
him
sue
in
the
association,
as
he
does
here,
you'd
be...
you'd
lump
all
the
wealth
of
the
entire
group
together
and
they'd
have
to
be
without
funds
as
an
entity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
i
think
that
you
will
have
more
in
forma
pauperis
actions
allowed
if
you
allow
class
actions
with
just
an
indigent
named
plaintiff
than
you
would
if
you
looked
at
the
assets
of
the
entire
class,
which
is
what
we
would
do
in
this
case.
