john
paul

what
did
you
call
the
principle
that
congress
only
intended
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
a
principle
or
that's
just
an
observation
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
has
the
congress
rejected
from
time
to
time
suggestions
to
expand
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
i
don't
think
you
have
any
evidence
for
your
supposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
say
context
means
more
than
the
words
of
the
statute
itself.
context
means
the
environment
for
the
milieu
in
which
the
statute
was
adopted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
section
1
then
requires
us
to
look
at
legislative
history
in
every
case
to
be
sure
it
doesn't
otherwise
require.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
statutory
directive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were...
suggested
that
if
there
hadn't
been
this
history,
the
word,
person,
would
normally
be
read
just
to
include
individuals.
but
i...
just
glancing
at
the
rules,
rule
19
talks
about
joinder
of
persons
needed
for
adjudication
and
so
forth.
the
whole
language
is
all
about
persons.
you
don't
think
that
excludes
paupered
persons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
harder
case
than
my
example.
well,
sure
it
would
be
a
harder
case
because
you
have
to
overcome
the
argument
that
your
reading
is
absurd,
and
that's
what
you
saying.
that's
what
you'd
look
at
to
see
if
was
absurd,
and
you'd
say
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
it's
harder
to
that
extent.
you
got
one
more
hurdle
to
cover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
inconsistency
in
your
position.
you're
making
alternative
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
doesn't
at
all.
the
statute
doesn't
say
he
must
appoint
counsel
or
even
he
may
appoint
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
section
says
he
may
request
an
attorney--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
represent
any
such
person,
but
the
lawyer
can
say
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--neither
do
individuals
generally
appear
without
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
shaking
his
head.
he
shouldn't
do
that
during
your
argument,
but
he--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
many
of
these
in
forma
cases,
there
are
volunteer
associations
of
lawyers,
pro
bono
groups
that
do
volunteer
legal
services
without
the
judge
intervening.
they
draft
the
complaint
and
so
forth.
and
that
could
have
happened
here
whether,
in
fact,
it
did
or
not.
