if
we
don't
go
beyond
the
text,
do
you
lose?
justice
david

what's
your
best
textual
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
aren't
you
getting
beyond
the
text
of
the
statute
when
you
say
that?
i
mean,
that's
your
parsimony
argument,
and
you
have
to
go
to...
i
guess
you
have
to
look
at
a
lot
of
congressional
history
beyond
this
statute.
if
you
just
look
at
the
text,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
is
there
anything
in
the
text
that
supports
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
men's
advisory
council
is
an
association
of
california
prison
inmates.
the
council
moved
to
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
under
28
u.s.
code
1915,
which
authorizes
federal
courts
to
favor
any
person
meeting
its
criteria
with
the
series
of
benefits
including
the
opportunity
to
litigate
without
pre-paying
fees,
costs,
or
giving
security.
the
district
court
denied
the
council's
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
council
qualified
as
a
person
entitled
to
1915
benefits
because
it
was
an
association
within
the
meaning
of
1
u.s.
code
1,
which
provides
an
irrelevant
part
that
in
determining
the
meaning
of
any
act
of
congress
unless
the
context
indicates,
otherwise
the
term
"person"
includes
associations.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
hold
that
only
a
natural
person
may
qualify
for
treatment
in
forma
pauperis
under
section
1915.
although
we
agree
that
we
must
let
to
1
u.s.
code
1
in
determining
the
meaning
of
the
term
"person"
in
section
1915.
we
conclude
that
the
context
of
section
1915
indicates
that
congress
used
the
word
'person'
in
that
statutory
for
only
to
natural
persons,
thus,
excluding
artificial
entities
such
as
the
council.

thomas

opinion

blackmun,
stevens,
