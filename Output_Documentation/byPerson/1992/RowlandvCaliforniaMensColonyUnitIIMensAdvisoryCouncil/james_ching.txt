mr.
james
ching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1915(a)
permits
persons
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
upon
the
filing
of
a
proper
affidavit
of
indigency.
the
issue
today
is
whether
associations
or
corporations
may
also
apply
and
whether,
therefore,
they
are
persons
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
relevant
events
concerning
this
statute
are
few
and
can
be
briefly
described.
prior
to
1959,
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
was
limited
to
citizens,
and
prior
to
1959,
the
case
law
is
perfectly
unequivocal.
those
citizens
were
only
natural
persons.
they
were
not
corporations,
and
a
fortiori,
they
were
also
not
associations.
mr.
james
ching
the...
corporations
were
considered
citizens
for
the
purpose
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
they
are
not
entitled
to
powers
of
immunity
under
the
constitution.
consequently,
there
was
some
discretion
in...
according
them
various
privileges
such
as
the
in
forma
pauperis.
the
second
circuit
in
two
cases
held
that
they
were
not
to
be
afforded
the
benefits
of
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
therefore,
up
to
1959,
the
application
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
below
would
have
been
summarily
rejected.
mr.
james
ching
it
would
have
been
rejected
certainly
in
the
second
circuit
with
no--
mr.
james
ching
--well,
i
would
guess
that
the
period
of
time
between
1938
and
1959,
in
which
no
single
case
arose,
indicated
that
there
was
some
unanimity
on
the
point.
i
have
no
other
thought
about
the
nature
and
number
of
cases
involved.
but
in
1959,
congress,
with
the
explicit,
singular,
and
unequivocal
intention
of
according
the
benefit
of
in
forma
pauperis
to
resident
aliens
and
resident
aliens
alone
substituted
for
the
word,
citizen,
in
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
the
term,
person.
then
for
a
period
from
'59
to
'69,
utterly
no
litigation
at
all
on
the
point.
what
this
would
indicate
to
me,
in
sum,
is
number
one,
the
statute,
whether
referring
to
citizen
or
to
person,
never
referred
to
artificial
persons.
it
only
referred
to
natural
persons.
secondly,
in
the
amendment
in
1959,
the
language
is
we
would
extend
the
same
privilege
as
is
now
afforded
citizens
to
resident
aliens.
mr.
james
ching
that
is
the
language
of
the
report,
the
senate
report,
in
the
statutory
history.
mr.
james
ching
i
do
not...
i
only
had
the
congressional
news
report.
i
do
not
know.
however,
drawn
from
this
examination
of
the
statutory
reports,
there
are
two
principles:
first,
that
the
intent
of
the
legislation
was
only
to
include
another
category
of
natural
persons,
residential
aliens;
and
principle
number
two,
that
congress
has
been
extremely
parsimonious
in
extending
the
benefit
of
ifp
to
any
other
groups.
well,
this
brief
summary,
of
course,
compromises
the
core
of
the--
mr.
james
ching
--to
parsimoniously
extend
the
benefits
of
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
james
ching
i
guess
it's
an
observation.
it's
a
generalization
which
i
think
is
fairly
drawn
from
the
statutory
history.
mr.
james
ching
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
james
ching
all
right.
well,
in
any
case,
the
single
instance
in
which
they
have
expanded
it
with
an
enactment
has
been
this
1959
amendment.
the
core
of
the
minority
position
is...
takes
note
of
the
fact
that
in
1948
the
section
1
of
title
1
was
amended
to
create
persons...
a
definition
of
persons
that
included
corporations
and
associations.
this
would
seem
in
light
of
the
lack
of
any
reference
in
section
1
to
1915
to
be
an
irrelevant
definition.
it
is
even
more
irrelevant
in
light
of
the
qualification
that
is
explicit
in
section
1,
that
unless
the
context
is
consistent
with
the
definition
of
persons,
it
is
not
to
be
used.
mr.
james
ching
unless
the
context
otherwise--
mr.
james
ching
--indicates.
of
course,
the
meaning
of
context
is
not
spelled
out,
but
surely
context
must
at
least
include
the
events
surrounding
the
amendment
in
1959,
as
well
as
the
cases
from
the--
mr.
james
ching
--certainly.
yes,
that
is
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
james
ching
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
ching
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
ching
and
since,
in
fact,
we
are
attempting
to
implement
the
intent
of
congress,
then
certainly
we
must
understand
what
they
mean
if
they
use
the
word,
person.
mr.
james
ching
i
would
not...
i
would
think
that
the
use
of
such
a
general
term
would
not
exclude
much.
mr.
james
ching
and
certainly--
mr.
james
ching
--and
there
is
nothing
in
section
1
to
indicate
what
context
means.
mr.
james
ching
yes,
and,
con,
would
indicate
with
or
adjoining
to,
and
so--
mr.
james
ching
--if
that
were
so,
that
would
indicate
a
restriction
to
only
the
statute
which
purported
to
define
person
in
a
separate
and
distinct
manner.
the
cases,
the
ftc
case
and
so
on,
dealing
with
the
use
of
person
doesn't
seem
to
indicate
such
a
narrow
restriction.
mr.
james
ching
well,
anything
that
would
indicate
its
meaning.
yes,
i
would
think
that
you
would
look
to
the
text
first.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
james
ching
yes,
it
certainly
is.
mr.
james
ching
no.
i
do
not
believe
that
i
lose
if
we
are
permitted
to
examine
statutory
materials
related
to--
mr.
james
ching
--my
best
textual
argument
is
that
which
i
led
with;
that
is,
there
has
been
a
consistent
restriction
to
natural
persons
both
in
case
law
and
in
the
bill.
mr.
james
ching
well,
the...
by
inference,
the...
i'm
hard
put
to
give
you
an
answer
on
that.
mr.
james
ching
the
requirement
for
an
affidavit
is,
of
course,
tied
up
with
the
complications
of
a
corporate
identity.
mr.
james
ching
well--
mr.
james
ching
--it
could--
mr.
james
ching
--well,
it
could
not
make
it
directly
as
implied
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
i
would
think
that
tied
up
with
that
is
the
inability
to
determine
what
the
corporate
assets
are
for
the
purposes
of
the
litigation
at
hand.
so--
mr.
james
ching
--yes,
unequivocally.
mr.
james
ching
no,
i
would
not
think
so.
mr.
james
ching
well,
i--
mr.
james
ching
--i
would
not.
i
hate
this,
but
i
really
do
believe
that
a
bankrupt
corporation
could
make
an
affidavit
of
poverty
through
its
trustee.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
i
mean,
there
are
many
other
technical
terms
that
would
more
accurately
describe
a
corporation
without
funds
to
pursue
litigation.
mr.
james
ching
i
do
not
think
it
is
as
significant
as
the
other
point
justice
scalia
made.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
yes,
at
least
that
range
and
intent
of
the
legislature
was--
mr.
james
ching
--the
corporations
and
associations
are
not
of
the
first
concern
in
terms
of
public
welfare.
mr.
james
ching
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
bankruptcy...
any
of
the
prevailing
tests
for
determining
it
bankrupt
would
automatically
be
imported
into
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
mr.
james
ching
certainly,
and
the
practical--
mr.
james
ching
--i
hesitate.
i
hesitate
to
answer
for
the
ninth
circuit.
however,
in
all
seriousness,
i
do
believe
income
flow
is
one
of
the
key
provisions
for
determining
in
forma
pauperis
status.
mr.
james
ching
it
is
simply
stating
that
it
is
unable
to
engage
in
the
business
for
which
it
was
created,
and
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
a
lesser
claim
than
that
of
bread
on
the
table
for
an
individual.
and
surely,
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
was
more
directed
to
the
individual
in
dire
straits
than
a
corporation
in
dire
straits.
mr.
james
ching
i...
the...
one
of
the
major
problems
with
the
case
is
the
lack
of
development
of
facts
upon
discovery
in
this
instance.
we
do
know
of
instances
in
which
inmates
have
considerable
money.
mr.
james
ching
so,
i
would
not
concede
that
as
a
theoretical--
mr.
james
ching
--individual
plaintiffs.
mr.
james
ching
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
complaint
itself
speaks
of
certification
as
a...
of
a
class
action.
i
do
not--
mr.
james
ching
--well,
certainly,
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
could
have
pursued
a
class
action.
i
think
that's
what
they
should
have
done.
mr.
james
ching
well,
your
honor,
the...
i
would
think
the
ifp
status
would
be
granted
for
him,
for
the
individual
involved.
mr.
james
ching
yes.
mr.
james
ching
well,
that's
one
of
the
tests
that
has
been...
that
have
been
proposed,
that
is,
lumping
or--
mr.
james
ching
--well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
i
mean,
part
of
our
concern
is
the
administration
of
the
courts
and
the
volume
of
cases
that
arise.
in
the
instance
where
there
is
a
certified
class
action,
we
at
least
have
the
confidence
to
know
that
there
is
an
interest
that
is
common
to
all
the
parties
involved,
and
in
addition,
it
greatly
simplifies
our
need
to
discover
individual
statuses
and
individual
capacities.
mr.
james
ching
no,
no.
i
had
suggested--
mr.
james
ching
--i
had
suggested
that
the
individual
would
proceed
and
would,
therefore,
move
for
certification
as
a
class
action.
at
that
point,
if
the
class
is
going
to
be
maintained,
i
believe
some
inquiry
as
to
the
individual
capacities--
mr.
james
ching
--of
the
members
of
the
classes--
mr.
james
ching
--would
then
proceed.
there
would
be
a
subsequent
xxx.
mr.
james
ching
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation--
mr.
james
ching
--yes.
mr.
james
ching
well,
in
that
regard,
i'm
also
looking
at
the
limitation
upon
the
definition
of
citizen
which
precede
it
in
the
very
same
statute
and
which
has
been...
which
had
been
accepted
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
in
light
of
that
and
the
use...
and
the
amendment,
the
explicit
amendment,
only
to
include
resident
aliens,
i
would
feel
that
a
common
definition
of
person
would
be
appropriate.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
ching
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
two
brief,
very
brief,
points.
the
first
is
this
counsel
point
which
crops
up
again.
if,
in
fact,
we
have
to
take
corporations
and
associations
simultaneously
because
of
the
definition
of
section
1,
then
it
means
the
19...
under
provisions
of
1915,
each
of
those
will
have
to
have
appointed
counsel.
mr.
james
ching
certainly--
mr.
james
ching
--exactly
right.
mr.
james
ching
and
my
point
is
that
corporations
never
appear
except
through
counsel,
and
a
fortiori,
neither
can
associations.
there
is
internally--
mr.
james
ching
--an
inconsistent
provision--
mr.
james
ching
--well,
in
forma
pauperis
individuals
appear
without
counsel
all
the
time,
my
point
being
that
if
the
general
rule
regarding
representation
of
corporations
is
followed
through,
the
statute
does
not
adequately
address
the
special
needs
of
corporations
and
associations
to
appear--
mr.
james
ching
--yes.
mr.
james
ching
meet
you
at
the
courthouse,
yes.
mr.
james
ching
he
was
appointed
by
the
court.
mr.
james
ching
pro
bono.
my
point
is
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
ching
--and
so
am
i
because
i
was
appointed
by
the
court
without
authorization
other
than
that.
but
the
only
point
i
make
is
if
the
statute
is
worded
in
terms
of
discretionary
appointment
of
statute...
of
counsel,
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
that
associations
or
corporations
could
be
in
forma
pauperis
because
they
must
appear
through
counsel.
mr.
james
ching
well,
it
was
a
simple
point
well-refuted.
i'm
prepared
to
submit
the
matter.
