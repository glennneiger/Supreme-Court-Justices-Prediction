chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-1188,
james
rowland
v.
the
california
men's
colony.
mr.
ching.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
says
unless
the
context
otherwise
requires,
doesn't
it,
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
unless
the
context
indicates
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
difference
also.
when
an
individual
says
that
that
person
is
unable
to
pay
such
costs,
you're
talking
about
a
person
perhaps
supporting
themselves,
getting
food
on
the
table,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
when
a
corporation
makes
an
affidavit
that
it's
unable
to
pay
the
costs,
what
factors
does
it
take
into
consideration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ching.
mr.
weisselberg,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
know
that
that
is
the
strongest
argument
i've
ever
heard,
that
if
congress
were
sitting
down
and
thinking
about
this
right
now,
and
you
said,
well,
do
you
want
corporations,
as
well
as
natural
persons,
to
be
able
to
proceed
ifp,
you
say
yes,
congress
would
have
said
yes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we're
talking
about
corporations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
supposing
the
secretary
of
the
corporation
or
the
president
of
the
corporation
is
going
to
make
an
in
forma
pauperis
affidavit,
what
does
he
take
into
consideration
that
will...
what
sort
of
corporate
picture
does
he
have
to
have
before
he
can
say
that
the
corporation
is
unable
to
pay
the
costs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
has
to
affirm.
he
not
only
has
to
set
out
statistics,
but
he
has
to
swear
that
the
corporation
is
unable
to
meet
the
costs.
isn't
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
decision
making
process
does
he
go
through?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
with
an
individual,
you
know,
a
person
presumably
is
thinking
about
food,
shelter,
some
clothing,
any
liquid...
you
know,
any
cash
at
all,
and
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
a
corporation
ordinarily
thinks
in
those
terms.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
way
of
construing
1915
to
say
that
associations
are
included
within
the
word,
person,
but
corporations
aren't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it's
either
corporations
and
associations,
or
it's
neither.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
free
to
look
at
the
assets
of
the
individual
members?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
one
judge
could
look
at
the
assets
of
the
individual
members
and
another
judge
would
not,
and
either
one
would
be
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
is
the
rule
in
your
view
that
ought
to
be
enunciated?
when
an
association
files
for
ifp--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--may
a
court
consider
the
assets
of
the
individual
members
or
only
those
of
the
association?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you've
answered
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
don't
you
give
me
an
answer
to
the
question
and
then
explain?
does
a
court
look
to
the
assets
only
of
the
association,
or
does
it
look
to
the
assets
of
the
individual
members?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weisselberg.
mr.
ching,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ching.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
in
no.
91-1188,
rowland
against
california
men's
colony
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
