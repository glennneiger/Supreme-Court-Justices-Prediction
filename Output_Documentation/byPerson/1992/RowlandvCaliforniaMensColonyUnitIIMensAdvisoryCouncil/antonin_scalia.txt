justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
language
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
house
report?
did
that
say
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
context
not
include?
justice
antonin
scalia
anything?
anything
at
all?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
they
just
didn't
say
then
unless
there
is
some
reason
to
think
otherwise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
word,
person,
means,
you
know,
but
they
didn't
say
that.
they
said
unless
the
context
indicates
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
word,
context,
comes
from
the
word,
text.
context.
it
means
the
surrounding
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
textual,
there's
contextual,
there's
extratextual.
i
think
context
means
context.
the
passage
in
which
the
word
is
used,
the
surrounding
statutory
language.
don't
you
think
that's
what
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
normal
to
talk
about
a
corporation
making
an
affidavit,
is
it?
it
says
that
you
can't
get
ifp
status
unless
you
make...
unless
the
person
makes
an
affidavit
that
he
is
unable
to
pay
such
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
such
affidavit
shall
state
the
nature
of
the
action,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
affiant's
belief
that
he's
entitled
to
redress
it.
i
mean,
i
guess
you
could
say
that
the
corporation
can
make
an
affidavit
through
one
of
it's
officers,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
sort
of
a
stilted
use
there,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
part
of
the
context
is
also
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
providing
for
treatment
as
an
indigent
and
providing
public
funds
to
be
used
for
purposes
that
otherwise
people
are
required
to
pay
for.
that's
the
part
of
the
context,
right?
that...
that's
how
the
word
is
used
in
that
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
public
charity
is
not
usually
accorded
to
corporations.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
bring
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
purchasers
of
at&t
stock,
and
just
because
i
happen
to
be
bankrupt,
i
can
bring
that
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
at&t
stockholders
in
forma
pauperis?
is
that
really
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
said,
that
so
long
as
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
that
makes
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
was
the
same
congress,
after
all,
that
enacted
that
definitional
section.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
years
elapsed
between
the
people
that
voted
for
that
definitional
section
and
the
people
that
voted
for
1915,
as
amended?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx.
what
difference
does
it
make?
i
mean,
the
argument...
i
don't
care
what
the
men's
dormitory...
today
it's
the
men's
dormitory
council.
tomorrow
it's
going
to
be
some
association
of
millionaires--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
simply
haven't
put
very
much
money
into
this
association
or
corporation.
so,
you
have
a
very
impoverished
corporation
composed
of
members
who
are
very
wealthy,
and
you
would
have
to
argue,
well,
a
person
is
a
person.
this
is
an
association.
the
association
as
an
association
is
poor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
underfunded.
people
bought
stock
in
the
corporation.
the
business
didn't
do
very
well.
since
it
was
a
losing
business,
they
declined
to
contribute
any
more
money,
but
in
fact,
all
of
the
owners
of
the
stock
are
millionaires.
is
that
underfunded?
it's
just
a
poor
corporation.
there
is
no
blame
there.
it
just
so
happens
that
it's
owned
by
millionaires.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
lawyers?
this
section
1915
also
requires
that
the
court
may
request
an
attorney
to
represent
any
such
person
unable
to
employ
counsel.
now,
counsel
are
very
expensive.
you...
do
you
think
that
in
this
context
we
should
interpret
that
to
mean
corporations
and
associations,
that
the
courts
are
going
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
corporations?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you
think
the
same
about
corporations
as
you
do
about
partnerships
and
associations,
that
you
look
to
the
stockholders?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
would
mean
you
normally
wouldn't
look
to
the
stockholders.
unless
there's
some
special
malice
or
fraud
or
something
involved,
you
don't
look
to
the
stockholders.
so,
it's
enough
that
the
corporation
is
impoverished.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
i
form
a
corporation
to
do
a
public
interest
litigating
functions,
public
interest
litigation
firm,
only
its
causes,
the
causes
it
wants
to
litigate,
are
very
bad
causes,
so
it
can't
raise
any
money.
it
raises
very
little
money.
no
problem,
right,
because
it
will
be
able
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
and
even
to
have
the
court
appoint
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
but
there's
no
fraud
involved
here.
i
thought
you
said
normally
you
don't
look
past
the
corporation
unless
the
usual
reasons
that
you
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
there's
nothing
underhanded
about
setting
up
a
corporation
with
very
small
capital.
there's
nothing
evil
about
that.
that's
perfectly
valid.
there's
no
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
then
whenever
you
have
a
poor
corporation,
you
do
look
behind...
you
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
just
going
around
again.
as
i
say,
under
normal
principles
of
corporate
law,
you
don't
pierce
the
corporate
veil
unless
there's
some
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge,
though,
that
legislative
history
is
relevant
within...
it
is
part
of
the
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
just
did.
you
just
said
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
xxx,
you
should
say
no,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
it's
still
not
context.
no
matter
how
clear
it
is,
it's
not
context.
