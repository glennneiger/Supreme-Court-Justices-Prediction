mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
main
reasons
why
the
men's
advisory
council
may
sue
in
forma
pauperis.
first,
under
the
plain
and
unambiguous
statutory
language,
an
association
may
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
second,
if
this
court
does
decide
to
look
to
the
legislative
history,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statutes.
and
third,
the
statutory
context,
meaning
the
overall
text,
structure,
and
purpose
of
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute,
does
not
require
a
restricted
definition
of
the
word,
person.
turning
first
to
the
statutory
scheme,
1
u.s.c.,
section
1--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
one...
your
honor--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
1
u.s.c.,
section
1
does
have
the
phrase
which
counsels
the
court
to
look
to
the
context,
and
what
i
mean
is
that--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--one
and
three
are
in
that
way
related.
but
1
u.s.c.,
section
1
defines
person
to
include
associations.
section
1
was
on
the
books
when
section
1915(a)
was
amended
to
include
persons.
section
1
is
congress'
own
dictionary.
it
gives
a
mandatory
definition
of
the
word,
person,
because
it
is
the
definition
that
congress
itself
has
written.
in
wilson
v.
omaha
indian
tribe,
this
court
construed
the
phrase,
white
person.
the
court
held
that
congress
was
aware
of
its
own
dictionary,
and
so
when
congress
reenacted
the
law
using
the
phrase,
white
person.
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
phrase
would
be
construed
to
cover
artificial
entities,
as
well
as
individuals.
now,
it
makes
sense--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--well,
your
honor,
the...
section
1
was
amended
in
i
believe
1948.
section
1915
was
amended
in
1959.
but
i
would
point
out
that
1
year
before
in
1958,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
united
states
v.
a&p
trucking,
and
in
that
case,
this
court
was
interpreting
a
criminal
statute
that
used
the
phrase,
whoever.
whoever,
is
defined,
along
with
the
word,
person,
in
1
u.s.c.,
section
1.
this
court
construed
the
phrase,
whoever,
to
include
partnerships
because
partnerships
were
included
in
the
section
1
definition.
so,
just
one
year
before
section
1915
was
amended,
this
court
decided
a
case
applying
section
1
to
construe
a
federal
statute.
and
it
makes
sense
for
congress
to
define
standard
terms
in
section
1.
that
saves
congress
from
redefining
those
terms
every
time
a
new
bill
is
passed.
but
congress
can
only
rely
upon
the
definitions
in
section
1
if
this
court
is
willing
to
make
those
definitions
mandatory.
the
petitioners'
claim
here
is
that
congress
was
silent
regarding
whether
an
association
may
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
but
i
would
suggest
the
congress
spoke
loud
and
clear
in
the
statute.
in
amending
section
1915(a),
congress
deliberately
used
the
word,
person,
and
congress
chose
that
word
knowing
that
the
word,
person,
has
a
specific
standard
statutory
meaning.
the
petitioners
want
that
phrase,
person,
in
section
1915
to
be
read
as
natural
persons,
but
if
congress
had
wanted
only
natural
persons
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
it
would
have
said
so
in
the
statute.
the
statute
would
have
said
that
natural
persons
can
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
or
that
individuals
can
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
or
that
citizens
and
aliens
can
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
or
congress
would
have
taken
the
time
to
craft
a
specific
definition
of
the
word,
person,
just
as
congress
has
done
in
a
variety
of
other
statutory
schemes.
but
congress
didn't
do
so.
it
used
the
word,
person,
which
has
a
standard
statutory
definition.
now,
the
petitioners
rely
quite
a
lot
on
the
legislative
history
to
the
amendment
to
section
1915(a).
in
response
to
an
earlier
question,
i'd
point
out
that
the
senate
report,
which
is
republished
in
the
u.s.
code
and
congressional
news,
i
think
also
reprints
the
house
report.
it
contains
it
in
great
detail
so
that
the
legislative
reports
from
the
two
chambers
are
reproduced
there.
and
those
reports
do
not
say
that
person
means
only
natural
persons.
there's
a
paragraph
that's
two
sentences
long
that's
entitled
purpose,
and
all
that
it
says
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
is
to
change
the
word,
citizen,
to
the
word,
persons.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
there
was
certainly
case
law
that
allowed
artificial
entities
of...
namely,
corporations
to--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--i
don't
believe
that
the
version
that
was
in
effect
at
that
time
included
the
word,
association.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
it...
several
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
again,
when
congress
changed
the
statute
and
chose
the
word,
person,
which
was
then
defined
to
include
a
category
of
people
other
than
merely
corporations
and
aliens,
it
specifically
includes
associations.
i
also--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
i'd
suggest
that
the
context
here
does
not
exclude
associations
and
does
not
counsel
otherwise.
perhaps
i
ought
to
address
that.
i'd
suggest
that
the
court
consider
context
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
has
construed
the
word,
context,
and
looked
at
context
in
interpreting
a
number
of
statutory
schemes.
there
are
a
few
cases
that
come
to
mind.
there
is
department
of
energy
v.
ohio,
and
in
that
case,
this
court
interpreted
the
phrase,
sanction,
or
the
word,
sanction,
and
the
court
said
that
sometimes
looking
at
a
phrase
in
context
gives
a
meaning
that
a
phrase
lacks
in
isolation.
and
there
the
court
compared
the
use
of
the
word,
sanction,
in
several
different
subsections
of
the
particular
enactment.
so,
i'd
suggest
that
was
an
example
of
a
court
looking
at
the
overall
text
of
the
statute
to
decide
context.
and
here
i'd
suggest
that
context,
thus,
refers
to
the
overall
text
of
the
statute
and
not
to
a
legislative
history.
and
when
one
looks
at
the
overall
text
and
purpose
of
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute,
there
is
nothing
that
would
suggest
in
my
mind
that
the
statute
ought
to
be
limited
to
natural
persons
only.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
there
are
plenty
of
reasons
why
the
congress
would
have
said
yes
and
why
the
congress
deliberately
used
the
word,
person,
in
amending
section
1915.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
effective
advocacy
may
be
brought
about
through
associations
and
through
group
litigation.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
there
are
lots
of...
corporations
are,
of
course,
frequent
litigants
in
the
federal
courts,
and
it
may
well
have
been
congress'
intent
to
allow
those
corporations
to
continue
to
litigate
even
if
they
didn't
have
the
funds
to
support
the
litigation.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
i
suppose
initially,
at
the
very
least,
the
officer
would
get
out
the
assets
and
the
liabilities
of
the
corporation
and
list
the
income
of
the
corporation.
i
suppose
that
at
a
minimum
though
i'd
point
out
that,
of
course,
the
statute--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i
suppose
he
would
look
at
the
assets
again
and
the
liabilities
of
the
corporation,
see
if
there
is
a
way
that
the
corporation
would
have
the
funds
to
support
the
filing
fee,
and
figure
out
the
costs
in
that
respect,
your
honor.
he'd
have
to
go
and
determine
what
the
filing
fee
would
be
and
what
the
costs
of
the
civil
litigation
would
amount
to.
but
i
would...
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
i
don't
think
that
process
is
that
much
more
difficult
than
it
is
for
an
individual.
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
doesn't
give
the
courts
the
criteria
that
are
used
to
determine
whether
an
individual
may
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
that's
something
that--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--well,
and
that
might
be
one
reason
why
this
is
unlikely
to
be
used
by
many
corporations.
perhaps
it
would
help
address
the
policy
aspects
of
it
by
describing
the
men's
advisory
council
itself
in
a
bit
more
detail.
there
are
10
dormitories
in
unit
ii
of
the
california
men's
colony.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--justice
scalia,
i
disagree,
and
perhaps
i
can
explain
why.
the
reason
why
i
wanted
to
describe
the
men's
advisory
council
a
little...
in
a
little
more
detail
is
that
i
think
it's
an
excellent
example
of
a
situation
in
which
an
association
is
bereft
of
funds
and
actually
in
this
case
bereft
by
action
of
one
of
the
defendants,
the
warden.
but
going
back
to
the...
your
example,
justice
scalia,
that
of
a
corporation
perhaps
deliberately
underfunded,
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
gives
the
federal
courts
and
gives
the
district
courts
tremendous
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
organization
or
a
corporation
is
indigent.
and
if
a
corporation
is
underfunded,
that's
a
usual
instance
in
which
a
court
might
look
beyond
the
shell,
that
is,
the
structure
of
the
corporation,
to
the
assets
of
the
individuals.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
i'd
simply
suggest
that
it's
a
very
rare
instance
when
a
corporation,
even
if
it
is
bankrupt
or
going
bankrupt,
can't
spare
the
120
dollar
filing
fee
for
an
action
in
federal
court
or
funds
for
witness
fees.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
the
courts
are
free
in
their
discretion
i
believe
under
that
section
to
request
counsel
to
represent
an
indigent
association,
just
as
the
ninth
circuit
requested
us
to
represent
this
indigent
association.
of
course,
that's
on
a
pro
bono
basis,
as
i
think
this
court
recognized
also
in
the
mallard
decision.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i
suppose
that
it's
possible
that
an
inmate
may
have
filed
this
action
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
other
indigent
inmates
at
the
institution.
nevertheless,
this
association
is
one
that
was
formed
at
the
request
of
the
warden
with
the
specific
purpose
of
representing
the
inmates
to
give
them
representation
and
a
voice
in
the
way
the
prison
affairs
are
run.
this
is
the
organization
that
exhausted
administrative
remedies.
this
is
an
organization
consisting
of
elected
representatives
from
different
dormitories.
so,
this
is
a...
an
organization
very
well
suited
to
bring
this
action.
and
i
think
in
the
uaw
v.
brock
case,
this
court
recognized
that
it
may
be
better
in
many
circumstances
for
an
organization
composed
of
individuals
to
bring
an
action
than
it
would
be
to
proceed
through
a
class
action
under
rule
23.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
your
honor,
i
think
using
1
u.s.c.,
section
1,
all
of
the
entities
that
are
listed
in
that
section
would
come
within
the
meaning
of
the
word,
person.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
i
suppose
initially
i
would
look
to
1
u.s.c.,
section
1
and
consider
all
of
the
entities
listed
there
to
be
persons
if
i
suppose
the
court
were
to
think
that
for
some
reason
the
context
of
the
statute
indicates
that
only
several
of
them--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor,
generally
a
collection
of
individuals.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
associations
are
formed
in
many
ways
i
suppose,
but
the
question
here
isn't
whether
associations
per
se
can
litigate
in
federal
court
because
they
can.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
indigent
associations
may
proceed
under
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute,
and
to
the
extent
there
are
questions
of
standing--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--and
such,
they--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
in
that...
several
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
i
suppose
many
different
groups
can
form
an
association,
but
again
if
that
sort
of
an
association
sought
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
the
district
court
would
be
free
to
look
at
the
assets
of
the
individual
members
of
the
association.
but--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--they'd
be
free
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
the
courts
have
said
simply
that
there's
a
lot
of
discretion,
enormous
discretion,
in
the
judges
in
terms
of
how--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
discretion
will
have
to
be
guided
by
some
future
decisions
as
this
area
of
law
develops.
i
mean,
again--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
i
think
initially
the
court
ought
to
simply
look
at
the
affidavit
that
is
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
association.
in
the
adkins
case,
the
supreme
court
case--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--well,
i
think
initially
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
affidavit
which
describes
the
assets
of
the
association,
but
the
court
would
want
to
know,
in
essence,
the
purpose
of
the
association,
whether
it
was
formed
in
some
way--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--perhaps
to
avoid
paying
fees.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i
believe
the
court
should
look
to
the
assets
of
the
association
only
unless
the
materials
give
the
court
a
reason
simply
to
look
further,
say,
a
suspicion
that
the
organization
was
not
adequately
funded
by
the
members,
something
like
that,
your
honor,
some
indication
from
the
papers.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i'd
see
no
reason
why
the
court
couldn't
look
to
the
members
of
the
association
for
the
funds.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--your
honor,
i
would
say
the
court
should
look
to
the
affidavit
first
which
would
normally
set
out
the
assets
of
the
organization,
and
it
would
probably,
i
would
assume
in
this
circumstance,
give
an
indication
of
the
purpose
from
the
organization
and
from
that,
your
honor,
the
court
would
have
some
understanding
of
the
purposes
of
the
organization,
whether
it
was--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--ordinarily,
your
honor,
in
a
partnership,
one
looks
to
the
assets
of
the
members
of
the
partnership.
the
court
would
be
free
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
you
know,
again,
perhaps
this
is
a
good
instance
in
which
a
court
wouldn't
look
past
the
assets
of
the
organization.
i
mean,
in
this
case,
the
organization
consists
of
elected
members
from
the
prison
who
were
formed
by...
at
the
request
of
the
warden
with
a
purpose
of
addressing
administrative
problems
within
the
prison
itself,
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
individual
elected
representatives,
people
who
are
serving
because
the
warden
wanted
the
inmates
to
have
a
voice,
should
be
forced
on
their
own
to
pay
the
assets
even
if
they
were
able
to
gather
the
funds.
i
mean,
in
this
case
the
warden
prohibited
the
organization
from
collecting
funds.
the
record
clearly
states
that
the
organization
couldn't
have
an
account,
couldn't
collect
funds
through
a
fund
raiser
of
any
type.
so,
you
have
an
organization
which
was
formed
to
represent
the
inmates
and
was
made
indigent
by
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
action
itself.
so,
i
would
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
case
in
which
a
court
would
look
at
the
assets
of
the
organization,
the
bona
fide
purpose
of
the
organization,
and
not
look
further
than
that.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
the
courts
are
very
free
to
borrow
from
general
principles
of
corporate
law
when
one
pierces
the
corporate
veil.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i
would
say
that
in
general,
yes.
but,
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--well,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--i
think
the
court
would
want
to
look
and
see
if
the
person
who
formed
the
organization
did
so
having
funds
on
his
or
her
own
and
simply
underfunded
the
organization.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
your
honor,
i
mean,
under
those
circumstances,
i
assume
the
court
would
look
to
the
assets
of
the
organization.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
no.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
thought
i
said
that
the
court
would
look
initially
to
the
assets
of
the
corporation,
and
if
there
was
a
reason
under
generally
accepted
principles
of
corporate
law
to
look
past
the
assets
of
that
organization,
the
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
frankly,
i
know
the
court
has...
and
we've
taken
an
awful
lot
of
time
discussing
what
may
appear
to
be
this
practical
problem,
but
in
general
i
am
not
at
all
certain
that
the
courts
will
have
difficulty
assessing
when
organizations
can
go
in
forma
pauperis.
and
i
don't
really
that
this
is
something
which
will
come
up
much.
i
mean,
frankly,
the
southern
district
of
new
york
decided
the
harlem
river
case
15
years
ago.
in
that
case,
the
district
court
held
that
associations
and
corporations
are
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute.
i
think
this
court
can
take
note
of
the
fact
that
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
a
district
which
has
quite
a
number
of
corporations
and
associations,
and
yet,
since
the
harlem
river
case,
no
case
has
reached
the
second
circuit
on
this
issue.
there's
no
other
reported
case
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
i
don't
know
that
this
is
something
which
is
going
to
come
up
often.
also,
i
would
point
out
that
if
organizations
are
bringing
lawsuits
on
behalf
of
individuals,
it
may
well
be
that
there
would
be
a
reduction
of
litigation
in
the
federal
court
because
an
association
suit
may
replace
suits
of
many
individuals.
so,
first,
i
don't
know
that
this
is
something
which
will
cause
a
problem
for
the
courts,
and
i
don't
know
that
it
will
come
up
very
often
at
all.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute,
section
1915,
doesn't
even
give
guidelines
as
to...
assess
the
indigency
of
individuals,
and
yet,
the
courts
have
managed
to
fashion
their
own
rules
to
determine
when
individuals
can
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
and
the
courts
have
developed
that
jurisprudence
and
have
not
had
difficulty
in
developing
it.
and
i'd
suggest
that
the
courts,
if
associations
or
corporations
do
occasionally
sue
under
this
in
forma
pauperis
statute
in
the
future,
will
have
no
difficulty
developing
that
jurisprudence
either.
i
know
that
the
petitioners
have
suggested
that
legislative
history
means
context
and
that
the
court
ought
to
look
to
legislative
history.
i'd
suggest
that
context
means
overall
text
and
purpose
of
a
statute,
and
that
if
this
court
looks
to
the
legislative
history
in
this
case,
it
does
it
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
court
ordinarily
looks
to
legislative
history,
and
that
is
if
the
statute
is
deemed
ambiguous
in
any
respect
or
if
there
is
an
argument
that
interpreting
the
statute
literally
would
frustrate
the
intent
of
the
legislators.
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear.
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
section
1915
says
that
persons
may
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
and
1
u.s.c.,
section
1
says
that
persons
include
associations.
so,
it's
not
an
ambiguous
statute
and
one
should
not
look
to
the
legislative
history
under
that...
for
that
reason.
if
there
is
a
claim
that
interpreting
the
statute
literally
would
frustrate
the
intent
of
the
legislators,
i
think
this
court
in
union
bank
v.
wolas
said
that
a
party
making
that
argument
has
an
exceptionally
heavy
burden
to
meet.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case
for
me,
your
honor,
and
that
might
be
a
circumstance
in
which
a...
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
otherwise.
but
we
don't
have
that
at
all
here,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does,
and
it
doesn't
say
that
at
all
here.
the
legislative
history
contains
some
references
to
aliens,
and
it
may
well
be
that
some
legislators
were
motivated
to
amend
the
in
forma
pauperis
statute
to
allow
aliens
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
comes--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--no.
what...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
the
court
considers
legislative
history,
in
essence,
for
two
reasons:
one
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
this
statute
is
not
ambiguous;
second,
if
a
party
makes
a
claim
that
interpreting
the
statute
literally
is
absurd
or
would
lead
to
absurd
consequences,
or
that
it
was
contrary
to
the--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--thwart
the
intent
of
the
legislators.
that's
a
circumstance
in
which
this
court
has
in
the
past--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
i
said
that
would
make
it
a
much
harder
case,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--your
honor,
what
i'm
saying...
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
i
don't
think
that
context
includes
legislative
history.
i
think
if
this
court
looks
to
legislative
history,
it
does
for
the
other
reasons--
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
--that's
right.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
weisselberg
well,
all
i
wanted
to
point
out
is
that
i
think
that
a
party
that's
making
the
argument
that
interpreting
a
statute
literally
has
an
exceptionally
heavy
burden
to
meet
and
it
is
so
heavy
that
that
argument
failed
in
griffin.
it
failed
in
mansell
v.
mansell.
it
failed
in
ardestani,
and
it
must
fail
here.
well,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i--
