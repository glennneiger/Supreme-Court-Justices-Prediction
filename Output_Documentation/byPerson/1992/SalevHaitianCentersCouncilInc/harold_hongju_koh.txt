mr.
harold
hongju
koh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
you've
heard
the
government's
case.
but,
unfortunately,
that
case
differs
from
the
one
that's
before
you
in
four
crucial
respects.
first,
the
right
we
claim
is
not
a
right
of
entry.
it's
simply
the
right
not
to
be
returned
to
haiti,
a
country
where
our
clients
face
political
persecution.
these
interdictions
are
going
on
over
700
miles
away
from
the
united
states.
they
are
going
on
right
outside
haiti.
people
are
fleeing
from
haiti
to
anywhere
they
can
get
to.
there
are
some
700
islands,
if
you
refer
to
a
map,
between
here
and
haiti.
people
coming
from
port-au-prince
could
go
to
the
bahamas.
they
could
go
the
caymans.
they
can
go
to
mexico,
cuba,
the
virgin
islands,
honduras,
turks
and
caicos,
the
dominican
republic,
but
they
cannot
because
we've
erected
a
floating
berlin
wall
around
haiti
which
keeps
people
in.
secondly,
our
claim
is--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--your
honor,
they
are
not
interdicting
people
and
asking
them:
are
you
going
to
the
united
states?
they
are
interdicting
everyone,
without
regard
and
without
asking
them
where
they're
going.
and
that's
precisely
the
problem.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
your
honor,
if
someone
was
coming
from
700
miles
away
and
past
many
countries,
it
would
be
quite
a
while
before
we
were
sure
what
their
ultimate
destination
was.
and
there's
no
way
that
we
can
establish
exactly
where
they
are
going.
our
own
clients...
uh...
in
another
part
of
the
case
who
are
being
held
at
guantanamo,
all
intended
to
go
elsewhere.
nevertheless,
the
interdiction
order
is
not
designed
to
keep
haitians
out
of
the
united
states.
if
that
were
the
case,
the
interdiction
could
be
set
up
13
miles
outside
the
united
states.
instead,
it's
set
up
13
miles
outside
of
haiti.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
if
you
refer
to
the
government's
brief,
on
page
three,
they
point
out
that
under
the
old
interdiction
program,
the
one
that
operated
under
president
reagan
and
president
bush
for
more
than
10
years,
where
there
was
minimal
screening
applied,
that
that
program
was
very
effective,
and
that
it
saved
thousands
of
lives.
they
have
not
explained
why
a
program
which
now
dispenses
with
the
screening
and
returns
people
directly
to
their
persecutors
is
somehow
safer.
this
is
not
rescue.
this
is
aiding
and
abetting
their
persecutors
by
delivering
refugees
directly
into
the
hands
of
those
people
that
they
are
fleeing
from.
now,
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
not
the
president.
we
have
not
sued
him
and
he
is
not
here.
and
we
do
not
challenge
his
constitutional
authority
to
direct
foreign
and
military
policy.
the
president
has
issued
no
national
emergency
order.
he
has
not
issued
a
new
proclamation.
indeed,
that's
a
core...
uh...
point
of
their
case.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
that's
right,
your
honor.
miss
mahoney
conducted
her
entire
argument
without
reference
to
the
order
which
is
at
issue
here.
and
if
you
refer
to
pages
378
to
379
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
you
will
see
is
that
the
president
has
not
ordered
that
people
be
returned
to
haiti.
indeed,
on
the
joint
appendix,
at
327,
and
i
will
read
it
to
you,
the
press
release
that
was
issued
on
the
day
the
kennebunkport
order
issued:
"president
bush
has
issued
an
executive
order
which
will
permit
the
coast
guard
to
begin
returning
haitians
to
haiti.
"
and
if
you
look
at
the
order
itself,
he
says
that
the
secretary...
the
department
of
transportation
shall
issue
appropriate
instructions...
he
does
not
say
what
makes
them
appropriate.
and
then
in
2(c)(3)...
i'm
sorry...
2...
uh...
(c)(3)
"to
return
the
vessel"...
in
other
words,
there
is
no
despot...
dispute
that
what
he's...
uh...
suggesting
are
instructions
about
return...
"when
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
an
offense
is
being
committed
against
the
u.s.
immigration
laws.
"
in
other
words,
the
coast
guard
here
is
supposed
to
be
enforcing
the
immigration
laws,
and
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
that
brings
them
firmly
under
14
u.s.c.
89(b).
and
then,
"provided,
however,
that
the
attorney
general,
in
his
unreviewable
discretion,
may
decide
that
a
person
who
is
a
refuge
will
not
be
returned
without
his
consent.
"
that
is
the
target
of
243(h).
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
unreviewable
discretion
to
decide
whether
someone
who
is
a
refugee
may
be
returned.
that
discretion
was
removed
from
him
by
1253(h),
which
says
in
unambiguous
terms,
"the
attorney
general
shall
not
return
any
alien--
"
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--well,
your
honor,
the
point
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief
is
that
you
must
look
to
the
broader
purposes
of
this
statute.
if
what
the
government
says
is--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--well,
that's
a
further
point
of
our
contention.
the
government
suggests
that
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
somehow
that
243(h)
applies
worldwide,
and
to
any
chance
encounter
between
haitians
and
the
attorney
general.
that
is
not
what
we're
contesting.
what
we
are
contesting
is
that
in
the
unprecedent--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--your
honor,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
question
here
is
when
the
attorney
general
takes
the
immigration
laws
out
onto
the
high--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--if
the
issue
were
posed
that
way,
yes,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
but
the
question
is
not
that.
the
question
is:
when
the
attorney
general
takes
the
immigration
laws
out
onto
the
high
seas,
as
he
has
done
here,
then
do
the
restraints
of
the
statute
travel
with
him?
now,
as
the
government
points
out,
the
authority
that
they
claim
is
from
212(f)
and
215(a).
those
provisions
also,
by
the
way,
are
not
extraterritorial.
there
is
nothing
that
gives
them
an
extraterritorial
scope.
what
takes
them
extrator...
territorially
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
taken
them
out
onto
the
high
seas.
but
they
want
the
power
without
the
restraint
that
goes
along
with
it.
and
our
point
is
simply
that
when
u.s.
officials,
themselves,
choose
to
exercise
their
authorities,
their
immigration
authorities,
on
the
high
seas,
they
must
follow
the
statute
that
they
invoke
as
the
basis
of
their
authority.
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
they
can't
have
the
power
without
the
constraint.
and
understand,
your
honors,
that
the
motive,
the
humanitarian
motive
that
is
raised
repeatedly
in
the
government's
position,
is
irrelevant.
because
if,
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out...
uh...
the
attorney
general's
discretion
were
unreviewable,
then
the
attorney
general
could
simply
shoot
everyone
on
the
high
seas.
his
motive
would
be
irrelevant.
if
this
were
in
fact
the
case
in
the
current
day,
the
attorney
general
could
send
the
coast
guard
out
to
apprehend
fleeing
nazis
and
deliberately
return
them
to
their
pre...
persecutors.
if
chinese
students
were
outside
the
united
states
or
salman
rushdie
was
outside
the
united
states,
they
could
be
returned
to
china
and
iran,
respectively,
for
the
worst
of
motives,
because
there
would
be
no
law
governing
their
conduct.
and,
indeed,
your
honor,
if
president
aristide
himself
were
coming
from
haiti,
someone
who
undeniably
has
a
fear
of
political
persecution,
he
would
be
returned,
no
questions
asked,
directly
into
the
hands
of
his
persecutors.
this
has
a
broader
worldwide
implication.
if
this
interpretation
is
true,
the
germans,
facing
a
flow
of
refugees
from
bosnia,
could
take
to
the
high
seas,
apprehend
bosnians,
and
deliberately
return
them
to
serbian
death
camps,
because
they
are
under
no
constraint
of
law.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
law
against
it.
it
says
that
the
attorney
general--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--justice--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--justice
scalia,
i
would...
uh...
differ
with
your
interpretation
of
the
case.
the
holdings
in
the
earlier
determinations
or
the
earlier
determinations
or
the
earlier
cases
of
this
court
regarding
243(h)
did
not
address
the
question
of...
uh...
the
refugee
act
of
1980
and
what
it
did
to
the
previous
version
of
the
statute.
in...
there
were
three
important
changes
made.
may...
or
in
the
discretionary
power
in
the
attorney
general
was
made
mandatory...
the
word
"return"
was
added,
and
the
words,
"within
the
united
states"
were
dropped.
in
other
words,
it's
now
made,
"shall
not
return
any
alien",
where
before
it
was,
"may
return
an
alien".
now,
what's
stevic
held,
and
this
was
also
the
burden
of...
of
the
long
footnote
in
justice
stevens'
opinion
in
cardoza-fonseca
is
that
the...
uh...
conformance
of
the
united
states
to
article
33
compelled
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
under
the
old
243(h)
and
all
that
the
refuge
act
did
in
1980
was
to
make
it
mandatory.
what
is...
is
going
on
here
is
that
lower
executive
officials,
operating
pursuant
to
discretion,
supposedly
given
by
an
executive
order,
have
rewritten
the
statute
back
to
the
way
it
was.
instead
of
saying
"may",
it
now
says...
instead
of
saying
"shall",
it
now
says
"may".
instead
of
saying
"any
aliens",
they
would
read
it
to
say
"any
aliens
within
the
united
states.
"
and
instead
of
saying
"deport
or
return",
they
would
eliminate
the
word
"return".
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
but--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--but,
your
honor,
if
you
read
on,
what
you
will
see
is
that
it
was
suggested
that
the
attorney
general
honored
the
dictates
of
article
33,
and
thereby
exercised
his
discretion
in
conformity
with
it.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
your
honor,
that's
because
no
extraterritorial
interceptions
and
returns
were
going
on
at
the
time.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
your
honor--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--your
honor,
we
cite
here
simply
plain
language.
it
used
to
say
"any
alien
within
the
united
states.
"
and
that's
precisely
the
language
that
they
removed.
and
cardoza-fonseca
says
that
nothing
is
clear,
that
language
that
was
removed
should
be
not
be
sub
silentio
added
into
another
provision.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
but
that
illustrates,
justice
scalia,
is
the
point
that
was
raised
by
justice
kennedy.
article
33
is
self-executing,
so
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
exercise
his
discretion,
under
the
statute,
to
deport
people
from
within
the
united
states
back
to
their
persecutors.
what
happened
was
that
the
discretion
was
being
exercised
in
conformity
with
article
33.
the
revision
in
1980
brought
the
two
into
line
explicitly
by
using
the
same
language,
"shall
not
return
any
aliens".
and
the
only
way
that
this
can
be
avoided
is
to
read
those
words
out
to
read
"within
the
united
states"
back
in.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
your
honor,
the
11th
circuit
accepted
in
dictum
the
assertion
which
is
now
being
made
by
the
government.
which
is
that
the
removal
of
the
words
"within
the
united
states"
was
meant
to
encompass
deportables,
as
well
as
excludables.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
yes,
i
will.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
collateral
estoppel
requires
the
same
parties,
the
same
issue,
in
an
issue
that
was
actually
litigated
and
necessarily
determined.
our
people
were
not
there.
that's
as
simple
as
that.
they
were
different
parties.
these
are
screened
in
haitians
who
have
credible
fears
of
persecution.
and
they
were
not
adequately
represented
by--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--we
would
challenge
that,
your
honor,
as
the
2nd
circuit
pointed
out
below.
the
class
definition
was
people
who
have
been
detained
or
will
be
detained
on
cutters
and
guantanamo.
we
concede
that
that
was
part
of
it.
but
the
second
provision
was,
who
are
interdicted
pursuant
to
the...
the
u.s.
interdiction
program.
at
the
time
there
was
a
lawful
program
of
interdiction
and
screening.
now,
there
is
an
illegal
program
of
interdiction
without
screening.
those
are
different
programs.
third,
the
claim
was
that
were
challenging...
that
the
class
includes
people
who
were
challenging
a
violation
of
their
procedural
rights.
those
people
who
were
screened
in
and
found
to
have
credible
fears
of
persecution
claimed
no
challenge
or
no
violation
of
their
procedural
rights,
because
they
had
benefitted
by
those
procedures.
so
we
were
not
encompassed
in
the
class.
even
assuming
arguendo
that
we
were
encompassed
in
the
class,
we
were
not
adequately
represented
by
the
people
who
were
there.
they
were
all
screened
out.
and
they
were
neither
adequate
nor
typical
of
our
class.
and,
for
that
reason,
different
parties
were
there.
your
honor,
this
is
similar
to...
uh...
the
opinion
in
the
falcon
case,
general
telephone
v.
falcon,
where
a
conclusion
was
made
that
an
employee
could
not
adequately
represent
the
class
that
consisted
of
both
employees
or
applicants
for
employment,
because
they
are
different
groups.
or,
to
give
another
example,
martin
v.
wilkes,
whether
the
white
fire
fighters
are
precluded
by
the
black
fire
fighters.
again,
here,
they
are
both
haitians,
but
one
group
is
a
group
without
credible
fears
of
persecution,
who
are
therefore
economic
migrants,
and
our
class
are
those
who
have
the
most
fear
of
all.
and
that's
precisely
the
point.
this
is
not
a
polite,
bloodless
process
which
is
going
on.
our
clients,
our
named
plaintiff,
mr.
bertrand
and
mr.
remy,
who
my
own
co-counsel
counseled,
these
people
were
interdicted
on
the
high
seas.
their
boats
were
destroyed
by
the
coast
guard.
they
were
taken
to
guantanamo,
where
they
were
held
behind
barbed
wire
in
u.s.
captivity
for
months.
and
then,
when
they
asked
for
lawyers,
before
they
had
an
asylum
hearing,
they
were
forced
back
onto
the
boats
and
returned
to
haiti.
i
am...
uh...
i
will
point
you
out
the
trial
affidavits,
on
pages
51
to
65
of
our
joint
appendix,
at
port-au-prince,
mr.
bertrand
was
driven
off
the
boat
with
fire
hoses.
he
was
fingerprinted,
identified
by
the
haitian
military.
that
night
he
was...
uh...
taken
from
his
bed,
beaten,
his
left
arm
was
fractured,
and
he
fled
into
hiding.
and
he
would
now
flee
again,
but
for
this
program.
he
has
a
credible
fear
of
persecution.
he
would
be
screened
in,
but
for
this
policy,
which
does
not
recognize
a
legitimate
distinction
between
political
refugees
and
economic
migrants.
now,
the
point--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--yes,
we
do,
and
this
comes
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
making
with
justice
stevens.
we
are
not
talking
about
whether
243(h)
applies
to
any
random
encounter
between
an
alien
and
a
u.s.
official
outside
the
united
states.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
case
where
the
united
states,
in
an
unprecedent
move,
intentionally
goes
out
on
the
high
seas,
takes
people
into
their
custody.
it
is
the
act
of
taking
them
into
their
custody
outside
the
united
states
that
brings
them
within
the
control
of
the
attorney
general,
and
it
is
that
act
which
then,
authorizing
them
to
be
returned,
makes
the
coast
guard
an
agent
of
the
attorney
general
for
the
returned.
now,
justice
o'connor
raised
the
question,
could
they
have
been
referring,
when
they
withdrew
the
words
"within
the
united
states",
to
excludables
as
well
as
deportables.
the
short
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
had
they
intended
merely
to
reach
deportables
and
excludables,
they
could
have
said
shall
not
return
any
alien
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
if
you
examine
the
government's
reply
brief,
you
will
see
that
on
page
14
the
government
concedes
this
point.
it
says,
"the
essential
characteristic
shared
by
those
in
exclusion
and
deportation
proceedings
are
both
are
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
"
in
other
words,
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
delete
the
words
"within
the
united
states"
altogether.
and
there
is
no
valid
claim
that
what
was
actually
going
on
here
is
that
they...
the
pen
slipped,
because
at
the
same
time
that
they
deleted
the
words
"within
the
united
states",
they
added
the
words
"physically
present
within
the
united
states.
"
into
208.
that
was
part
of
the
procedure
that
was
going
on
at
the
same
time.
in
short,
what
happened
in
1980
was
that
congress
was
creating
three
statutory
classes
of
aliens.
first,
aliens
within
the
united
states,
those
lawfully
admitted,
who
are
subject
to
deportation
proceedings.
secondly,
those
physically
present
in
the
united
states
who
are
either
deportable
or
excludable.
and
third,
any
aliens,
those...
wherever
they
are
taken
a
hold
of.
and
that's
precisely
the
point.
someone
becomes
a
refugee
not
when
they
make
it
to
the
united
states,
they
become
a
refugee
when
they
flee
the...
when
they
clear
their
own
borders.
then
they
have
escaped
their
persecutor.
and
the
question
is
not
whether
we
need
to
let
them
in,
the
question
is
why
do
we
at
that
point
take
them
back
to
their
persecutor.
there
are
many
other
things
we
could
do.
we
can
interdict
and
screen
them,
as
was
done
for
10
years.
we
could
let
them
go
to
third
country
sites.
we
could
just
let
them
sail
on
to
the
bahamas
and
caimans.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
we
represent
no
screened-outs
here.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
we
represent
no
screened-outs
here.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
it
would
affect
those
people
who
have
been
screened
in
or
who
will
be
screened
in.
and
i
should
point
out
that
the
government's--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--all
that
we're...
the
government
has
no...
they
claim
to
have
a
problem
with
the
injunction.
what
they
have
a
problem
with
is
the
statute.
the
statute
says
you
shall
not
return
any
alien
without
screening.
if...
the
point
of
our
clients,
the
150
who
were
screened
in
and
then
returned,
is
they
would
flee
again
were
screening
reinstituted.
to
reinstitute
screening,
as
was
done
for
10
years
under
president
reagan
and
president
bush,
would
not
create
a
massive
inflow.
last
year,
over
a
9
month
period
with
no
serious
attempt
to
restore
the
democratic
government
of
haiti,
in
uncontrolled
migration
37,000
people
came
of
whom
only
something
like
10,000
were
screened
in.
and
if
you
examine
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
jewish
committee,
you
will
see
that
900,000
cubans
have
been
admitted,
that
200,000
eastern
europeans,
that
nations
many
times
smaller
than
ours
have
shown
much
more
generosity.
and
we're
not
asking
that
they
be
admitted.
all
we're
asking
is
that
they
be
given
some
form
of
temporary
safe
haven
outside
of
haiti,
the
country
that
they're
fleeing
from.
our
amicus
briefs
by
amnesty
international
and
americas
watch
and
the
two
court
rule
applying
to
the
district
court
findings
of
fact
and
the
second
circuit's
affirmance
of
that,
demonstrate
that
there's
heightened
political
repression
currently
occurring
in
haiti,
and
also
evidence
that
specific
plaintiffs
who
have
been
returned
have
been
abused,
were
tortured,
and
are
in
hiding
for
fear
of
their
lives.
so
why
return
these
people
directly
into
the
hands
of
their
persecutors?
this
is
tantamount
to
being
accomplices
to
their
persecution.
and
in
the
same
way
as
the
rules
against
torture
and
genocide
were
set
up
to
be
universal
proscriptions,
we
cannot
see
any
reason
why
a
country
would
have
no
power
to
send
someone
back
to
their
persecutors
in
their
own
territory
where
they're
most
powerful,
but
then
somehow
have
such
power
on
the
high
seas
where
they
have
no
sovereignty.
and
this
also
disproves
the
point
about
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality.
this
is
an
international
statute.
it
controls
refugee
flows
in
and
out
of
the
united
states.
it
effectuates
a
treaty,
an
international
treaty.
it
effectuates
an
international
human
rights
norm.
and
most
conclusively,
our
officials
have
themselves
taken
these
laws
extraterritorially,
and
now
that...
they
argue
that
this
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
should
somehow
apply
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
add
words
that
were
taken
out
previously.
now,
ms.
mahoney
has
suggested
that
what
is
not
required
is
asylum
screening,
but
the
kind
of
screening
that
went
on
before
was
preasylum
screening.
and
you
can
examine
the
joint
appendix
at
378;
what
was
asked
was
whether
they
had
a
credible
fear
of
persecution.
if
you
lack
such
a
fear,
you
could
be
returned.
this
was
a...
a
nononerous
procedural
burden.
and
the
fact
that
the
new
policy
is
effective
and
has
terrified
people
so
that
they
will
not
flee
is
not
a
reason
why
it's
legal.
i'm
sure
that
shooting
them
would
also...
or
drowning
them
would
also
dissuade
people
from
coming,
but
that
is
our
shame,
that
is
not
the
reason
why
it's
a
legal
policy.
this
also
rebuts
their
point
about
reviewability,
for
if
it
is
true
that
the
only
way
that
an
alien
outside
the
united
states
can
get
review
of
a
generally
applicable
government
policy
is
through
habeas
or
exclusion
then,
again,
the
attorney
general
could
simply
order
that
all
haitians
coming
on
the
high
seas
be
shot
and
that
would
be
unreviewable.
the
japan
whaling
case
and
cardoza-fonseca
both...
both
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
what's
going
on
here
is
immigration.
it's
a
construction
of
an
immigration
statute.
of
course
it
touches
on
foreign
policy,
immigration
cases
always
do,
but
the
court
can
construe
the
statutes
in
a
manner
which
is
consistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
plain
language
of
the
treaty
which
here
is
also
"return".
return
is
return
is
refolai
is
return.
in
other
words,
you
don't
take
people
back,
and
there
should
be
no
doubt
as
to
what's
going
on
here
because
the
executive
order
that's
being
invoked
says,
"you
shall
not"...
that
is
what
is
being
done
is
"return".
so
even
if
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
what
"return"
means,
that
is
what
the
executive
order
authorizes.
the
government
repeatedly
cites
the
knauff
case,
but
the
knauff
case
had
to
do
with
a
claim
of
inherent
executive
power
over
immigration.
what
is
going
on
here
is
a
power
which
is
purportedly
being
executed
pursuant
to
statute.
and
i
would
note
justice
jackson's
powerful
dissent
in
that
case,
where
he
said
security,
like
liberty,
is
dangerous,
for
many
other
crimes
that
are
committed
in
its
name.
this
is
essentially
what's
going
on
here,
your
honor.
in
short,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
mutually
reinforcing
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
treaty
make
it
clear
that
lower
executive
officials
shall
not
return
any
aliens
to
conditions
of
persecution
without
regard
to
their
physical
location.
once
they
have
cleared
their
own
frontiers,
they
become
subject
to
the
statute.
once
they
come
under
the
attorney
general's
control,
he
can
do
many
things
with
them,
and
we
do
not
tell
him
what
he
must
do
with
them,
we
only
tell
him
that
he
cannot
return
them.
ironically,
the
only
option
that
is
forbidden
is
the
one
that
has
been
chosen
here.
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
we
believe
that
that
only
reinforces
our
result.
it...
by
the
way,
if
the
treaty
is
self
executing,
as
we
assert,
it
eliminates
any
claim
that
the
coast
guard
or
the
president
are
not
bound
by
the
treaty.
and
we
believe
it's
absolutely
clear,
and
we--
mr.
harold
hongju
koh
--because
of
the
statute,
which
expressly
embodies
the
treaty.
so
we
win
either
way,
and
we
direct
you
to
the
attention...
your
attention
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
lawyers
committee
which
examines
the
self
executing
question.
your
honor,
in
closing,
ours
is
a
nation
of
refugees.
most
of
our
ancestors
came
here
by
boat.
if
they
could
do
this
to
the
haitians,
they
could
do
this
to
any
of
us.
because
the
second
circuit
correctly
ruled
that
blanket
summary
return
violates
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
treaty,
its
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
