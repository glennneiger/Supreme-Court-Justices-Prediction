isn't
it
true
that
both
1182(f)
and
1185
deal
with
the
power
of
the
president
to
prevent
entry
into
the
united
states,
rather
than
to
return
to
any
particular
destination?
it
addresses
a
different
problem,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
it
talks
about
entry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
suspend
entry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
deals
with
aliens
who
are
to
depart
or
enter,
or
attempt
to
enter
or
depart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not,
but
if
there
were
another
statute
that
said
you
shall
never
send
anybody
to
cuba,
for
example
in
so
many
words,
that
wouldn't...
this
statute
would
be...
the
statute
on
the
books
would
still
leave
the
president
full
of
power
to
control
entry
and
departures
from
the
united
states.
because
the
statute
would
then
place
a
limit
on
where
he
could
return
someone.
he
couldn't
send
them
to
cuba,
and
that's
what
they
argue
here.
i
don't
know
if
they're
right
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
well
maybe
it's
impractical
and
unrealistic,
but
at
least
theoretically
consistently
with
the
law,
he
could
interdict
them
and
send
them
someplace
other
than...
than
haiti.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
authority
to
keep
everybody
out
of
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
he
can't
do
that
as
a
practical
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
just
look
at
the
words,
it's
consistent
with
the
various--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
attorney
general,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but,
mr.
koh,
that's
the
issue.
i
mean,
if...
if
the
statute
doesn't
apply
outside
the
united
states,
then
he
does
have
unreviewable
discretion.
and
that's
what
we
have
to
decide.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand.
but
do...
would
you
not
agree
that
if
243(h)...
and
neither
the
statute
nor
the
treaty
applies
outside
the
united
states,
then
there's
nothing
wrong
with
giving
him
unreviewable
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it...
it'd
really
help
me
if
i...
i
understood
what
your
answer
to
my
question
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
state
my
question,
so
you
understand
it
clearly.
if
you
agree,
which
i
know
you
don't,
that
neither
the
treaty
nor
the
statute
applies
outside
the
territory
of
the
united
states,
then
would
you
not
also
agree
that
the
attorney
general
has
unreviewable
discretion
to
return
someone
who
is
apprehended
outside
the
united
states?
