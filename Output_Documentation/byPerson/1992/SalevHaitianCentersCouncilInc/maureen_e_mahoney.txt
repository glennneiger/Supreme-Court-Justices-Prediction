ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
scope
of
the
president's
emergency
powers
to
adopt
measures
that
he
deems
to
be
necessary
to
prevent
a
mass
migration
of
aliens
across
the
high
seas
and
to
the
ability
of
the
alien
migrants
to
challenge
those
measures
in
united
states
courts.
last
may,
in
the
first
20
days,
more
than
10,000
haitians
crowded
into
unseaworthy
vessels
and
set
sail
for
our
shores.
the
president
determined
that
he
could
not
stop
this
migration
while
continuing
to
offer
the
migrants
any
kind
of
asylum
screening
on
board
coast
guard
cutters
or
at
off-shore
locations
such
as
guantanamo.
he
accordingly
concluded
that
a
change
in
the
procedures
was
required
in
order
to
stop
the
migration
and
to
save
lives
that
he
concluded
would
be
lost
if
that
number
of
people
continued
to
flow
out
of
haiti
in
the
vessels
which
are
clearly
unseaworthy.
he
accordingly
invoked
his
powers
under
the
immigration
&
nationality
act,
which
are
in
the
nature
of
emergency
powers,
to
adopt
the
procedure
that
he
thought
were
necessary,
and
those
procedures
provided
that
the
coast
guard
should
directly
repatriate
haitians
without
asylum
screening
but
that
persons
who
genuinely
feared
persecution
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
seek
admission
as
a
refugee
through
asylum
processing
at
the
embassy.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it's
directed
at
haitians
who
were
leaving
for
the
united
states.
the
executive
order
directs
the
coast
guard
to
determine
whether
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
undocumented
aliens
are
seeking
entry
into
united
states
territorial
waters,
and
the
coast
guard
has
enforced
it
in
that
way.
once
the
procedures
were
changed,
the
exodus
that
had
begun
a
number
of
months
before
was
halted.
they
were
effective.
the
problem
that
we
face
now
is
that
the
threat
of
the
out-migration
continues
because
the
underlying
conditions
in
haiti
that
have
caused
people
to
wish
to
leave
their
country...
a
variety
of
political
and
economic
conditions...
continue
to
persist.
the
president
has
accordingly
determined
that
in
order
to
prevent
mass
migration,
just
as
last
may,
and
also
to
prevent
loss
of
life
at
sea,
perhaps
hundreds
or
thousands,
the
policy
of
direct
repatriation
must
continue,
but
the
president
has
also
directed
that
efforts
be
made
to
fully
fund
the
asylum
processing
in
haiti
so
that
those
who
wish
to
come
to
the
united
states
because
they
genuinely
fear
persecution
will
have
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
those
claims
expeditiously
in
haiti
and
flee
haiti
through
those
orderly
procedures.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
claiming
that
it's
unconstitutional.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
since
this
occurred?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
not
that
i
know
of.
i
don't
believe
that...
a
bill
might
have
been
introduced,
i
really
can't
say,
but
nothing
has
certainly
gotten
very
far.
the
coast
guard
is
accordingly
still
under
orders
from
the
president
to
interdict
haitians
and
to
repatriate
them
without
conducting
asylum
screening.
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless,
told...
directed
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
to
disregard
the
procedures
that
had
been
established
by
the
president
and
to
resort
to
the
procedures
that
had
been
suspended
by
the
president
last
year
in
the
national
interest.
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
permit
the
20
military
vessels
that
are
currently
stationed
off
the
coast
of
haiti
to
operate
under
the
direction
of
the
coast
guard
and
the
president
and
not
the
federal
courts.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
was,
your
honor,
but
this
court
stayed
it.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
i
believe
that
it
was
directed
against
all
of
the
defendants,
and
definitely
against
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
commanded
them
not
to
return
any
interdicted
haitian
who
would
be
threatened
with
persecution
in
haiti,
and
necessarily,
in
order
to
comply
with
that
order,
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
conduct
some
sort
of
asylum
screening
so
that
we
could
be
in
compliance
with
the
injunction,
otherwise
we
wouldn't
know
whether
we
were
returning
someone
who
might
fear
persecution.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
government
does
not
have
obligations
under
1253(h)
outside
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
it
is
a
humanitarian
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
provide
an
orderly
way
for
persons
with
genuine
fears
of
persecution
in
haiti
to
seek
asylum
and
come
to
the
united
states.
the
situation
that
we
had
before,
when
we
were
conducting
screening
on
coast
guard
cutters
and
at
guantanamo,
was
causing
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
to
essentially
risk
their
lives
so
that
they
could
get
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
asylum
outside
of
their
own
country
and
the
chance
to
come
to
the
united
states,
even
though
the
vast
majority
of
those
people
will
not
ultimately
be
found
to
be
eligible
for
asylum.
this
unnecessarily
creates
the
risk
of
loss
of
life
at
sea,
and
it
interferes
with
our
foreign
policy
initiatives,
which
very
fundamentally
depend
upon
bringing
order
and
stability
into
that
country.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
they
are
transported
to
the
united
states,
and
hundreds
of
people
have
in
fact
been
brought
to
the
united
states
pursuant
to
that
procedure,
which
again
is
being
expanded
by
the
president,
and
emergency
refugee
funding
was
just
devoted
to
that.
we
are
not
under
an
obligation
to
provide
that
process,
but
it
is
part
of
the
procedures
that
the
president
had
determined
constitute
an
appropriate
response
to
the
emergency
situation
in
haiti.
in
this
way,
the
asylum
claims
can
be
made
in
an
orderly
way.
they
can
be
adjudicated
more
effectively
because
persons
at
the
embassy
and
asylum
employees
who
are
adjudicating
the
claims
can
look
into
the
allegations.
trying
to
conduct
asylum
interviews
on
coast
guard
cutters
at
guantanamo
did
not
produce
results
that
really
very
accurately
reflect
the
true
nature
of
the
claims.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
those
are
not
extrastatutory.
that
is
a
procedure
that
congress
adopted
in
section
1157.
it's
a
procedure
for
refugee
admissions
for
aliens
who
are
outside
the
united
states.
in
fact--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
system
that
congress
set
up
really
reflects
the
differences
in
the
obli...
in
the
benefits
that
are
to
be
afforded
to
aliens
outside
the
united
states
and
aliens
who
have
reached
our
shores.
congress
provided
that
you
could
apply
for
asylum
in
the
united
states
and
it
could
be
granted
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
if
you've
reached
our
borders.
outside
the
united
states,
you
could
only
apply
for
asylum
if
the
president
determined
in
consultation
with
the
congress
that
a
nation
represented
a
particular...
an
area
of
humanitarian
concern.
and
haiti
is
one
of
the
very
few
nations
in
the
world
where
we
have
actually
established
in-country
asylum-processing
centers...
i
believe
there
are
only
five
or
six...
and
this
was
done,
again,
to
try
to
facilitate
the
adjudication
of
those
claims
and
to
stop
this
exodus
which
is
threatening
our
foreign
policy
interests
and
humanitarian
interests
as
well.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
we
do
not--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the...
the
point
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
power
that
the
president
has
under
1182(f)
and
1185(a)(1)
is
to
adopt
procedures...
these
are
in
the
nature
of
emergency
powers,
and
they
are
to
adopt
procedures
in
response
to
crises
abroad
or
international
situations
which
he
thinks
to
be
appropriate
in
the
national
interest,
and
it
is
these
combination
of
procedures,
direct
return
plus
the
availability
of
the
207
screening,
that
makes
for
both
a
humanitarian
policy
and
one
that
is
certainly
well
within
his
legal
authority.
the
scope
of
the
powers
that
were
conferred
by
congress
were
addressed
by
this
court
in
knauff
v.
shaughnessy
in
1950
before
the
'52
amendments
to
the
ina,
and
there
the
court
emphasized
that
these
powers
were
very
broad,
were
in
the
nature
of
emergency
powers,
and
in
fact
so
broad
that
the
president
could
in
fact
suspend
exclusion
hearings
when
he
deemed
it
to
be
appropriate,
even
for
aliens
who
had
reached
our
borders.
in
that
case,
the
bride...
alien
bride
of
an
american
soldier
was
not
allowed
entry
and
was
not
given
a
hearing
because
the
president
had
delegated
unreviewable
discretion
to
the
attorney
general
to
deny
such
procedures
when
he
thought
it
appropriate
in
the
national
interest.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
department
of
transportation,
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard.
the
attorney
general
has
not
issued
any
directives
to
the
coast
guard,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
does
not.
under
8
u.s.c.
section
1357
his
responsibilities
are
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
within
the
borders
of
the
united
states
and
within
the
territorial
waters,
so
this
further
underscores
that
if
congress
intended
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
president's
emergency
powers
under
1182(f)
and
1185(a)(1),
surely
they
would
not
have
simply
written
1253(h)
as
a
direction
to
the
attorney
general
and
included
it
in
parts
4
and
5,
which
deal
with
exclusion
and
deportation
proceedings.
these
are--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
you're
referring,
i
believe,
to
14
u.s.c.
section
89,
and
it
does
provide
that
when
the
coast
guard
is
acting
under
the...
basically
as
the
agent
of
a
particular
department,
that
it
will
use
its
procedures,
but
here
it
is
clear
that
the
coast
guard
is
acting
at
the
direction
of
the
president
under
the
president's
powers
under
1182(f)
and
1185(a)(1),
and
that
is
a
very
different
source
of
power
than
that
which
is
conferred
on
the
attorney
general
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
within
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
making
refugee
determinations
in
the
course
of
exclusion
and
deportation
proceedings,
and
i
would
note
that
1253(h),
the
express
language
is
directed
to
the
attorney
general,
and
if
the
attorney
general
makes
a
determination
that
a
person
would
be
subject
to
persecution,
then
they
shall
not
be
deported
or
returned.
that
language
simply
has
no
bearing
on
the
president's
exercise
of
his
powers,
separate
powers
under
1182(f).
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
irrelevant.
i...
i
mean,
certainly,
it's
the
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
and
said
it
was
not
extraterritorial,
which
we
agree
with,
but
this
simply
shows
that,
given
that
the
president
was
exercising
authority
under
different
sections,
if
congress
had
intended
to
circumscribe
those
powers,
it
would
not
have
written
1253(h)
in
the
way
that
it
did.
it
clearly
is
addressed
to
the
attorney
general
and
his
exercise
of
powers,
and
this
is
particularly
so,
given
that
the...
given
the
broad
interpretation
of
1185(a)(1)
that
had
already
been
adopted
in
knauff
v.
shaughnessy
when
congress--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
those
powers
are
very
broad,
they're
designed
to
give
the...
the
president
the
authority
to...
it
says
to
control
the
travel
of
aliens
and
prevent...
not
prevent,
excuse
me,
and
to
prohibit
attempts
to
enter.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
right.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
to...
to
suspend
entry,
but
1185(a)(1)
specifically
talks
about
prohibiting
travel,
and
by
adopting
rules
and
regulations
that
he
deems
appropriate.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
attempt
to
enter,
your
honor.
essentially,
the
proclamation
in
1981
said
that
the
attempt
to
enter
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas
by
undocumented
aliens
was
prohibited.
so
essentially
what
the
president
is
doing
here
is
enforcing
and
asking
the
coast
guard
to
enforce
that
limitation
that
was
established
by
proclamation
for
the
purposes
of
protecting
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well...
well,
that
could
be,
except
that
in
this
case
these
facts
demonstrate
that
that
would
make
the
powers
that
have
been
conferred
on
the
president
ineffective
under
these
circumstances.
the
president
has
determined
that
he
cannot
do
any
sort
of
refugee
screening
or
take
them
anywhere
else.
he
simply
cannot
enforce
the
interdiction
program
if
he
is
prohibited
from
taking
them
back
to
haiti.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
so,
in
other
words,
the...
it
would
be
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
skirt...
circumscribe
the
president's
authority
in
a
way
that
he
has
to
permit
a
mass
migration
across
the
seas
to
our
shores.
i
mean
we're
talking
about
potentially
100,000
people.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--uh--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
he
can't
do
that.
that's
the
point.
he
can't
enforce--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--he
can't
enforce
the
prohibition
and
1253(h)
is
not
directed
to
the
president,
it's
directed
to
the
attorney
general.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'd
also
like
to
turn
to
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
the
threshold
issue
really,
of
why
it
could
assert
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
what
was
the
cause
of
action
here?
the
apa
does
provide
a
cause
of
action,
but
we
submit
it
does
not
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
aliens
outside
of
the
united
states
to
challenge
the
president's
authority
in
this
manner.
the
whole
history
of
our
immigration
laws
has
been
to
deny
access
to
aliens
outside
the
united
states
to
u.s.
courts.
and,
in
fact,
if
we
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
they
demonstrate
very
clearly
that
the
way
that
aliens
get
a
right
to
bring
challenges
in
u.s.
courts
is
to
have
territorial
presence,
to
be
here,
to
be
at
the
borders
or
to
be
in
the
united
states.
1105(a)
specifically
says
that
orders
of
exclusion,
and
that
would
include,
for
instance,
orders
saying
that
you
are
not
allowed
to
come
into
the
country
which
are
issued
to
persons
outside
the
united
states
as
well
as
persons
inside
the
united
states,
can
only
be
challenged
by
persons
who
are
at
the
border.
orders
of
deportation,
of
course,
can
be
challenged
by
people
who
are...
are
within
the
united
states.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
if
self-executing
were
meant
to
create
a
cause
of
action,
an
actual
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
that
alien,
i
suppose
that's
true.
but
i
don't
think
that...
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
article
33
or
in
the
convention
as
a
whole
that
indicates
that
it
itself
creates
causes
of
action
that
can
be
brought
in
united
states
courts.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
and
it
was--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i
can
say,
though,
that
in
amerada
hess
recently,
the
court
did
note
that
even
though
there
were
rather
explicit
obligations
to
pay
compensation,
it
did
not
create
a
cause
of
action
that
was
enforceable
in
united
states
courts
because
it
didn't
say
that.
and
i
don't
think
that
there...
there
is
any
language
in
the...
in
the
protocol
that
would
suggest
that
there
is
an
independent
cause
of
action.
it
would
be
so
contrary
to
the
whole
history
of
our
immigration
laws.
i
mean
i
would
point
out,
for
instance,
that
under
the
immigration
and
national
act
even
persons
outside
the
united
states
who
claim
to
be
citizens
are
not
permitted
to
bring
an
action
in
united
states
courts.
that's
because
congress
has
determined
that
the
only
way
to
bring
that
challenge
is
to
get
a
certificate
from
the
consular
office
in
the
foreign
locality
that
you,
basically,
have
probable
cause
to
present
a
claim
of
citizenship,
in
which
case
they
will
permit
you
to
come
to
the
united
states
to
make
that
challenge,
but
you
cannot
do
it
from
outside
the
united
states.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
provide
any
rights
of
review
for
persons
who
think
that
they
have
been
unfairly
denied,
whether
it
be
refugee
admission
or
any
of
the
other
preferences
that
are
established
by
the
immigration
laws.
and
in
the...
in
one
apa
action
that
this
court
decided,
brownell
v.
tom
we
shung,
the
court
found
that
the
apa
could
be
used
for
an
alien
child
who
came
to
the
borders
of
the
united
states
and
claimed
a
right
to
enter
under
the
war
brides
act,
but
it
noted
in...
in
the
course
of
reaching
that
conclusion
that,
of
course,
aliens
outside
the
united
states
who
have
never
reached
our
borders
couldn't
possibly
maintain
a
claim
under
the
apa.
but
even
the
result
that
this
court
reached
in
brownell
was
overruled
by
congress.
and
the
legislative
history
indicated
it
was
a
fallacious
doctrine
to
suggest
that
aliens
outside
the
united
states
could
come
into
u.s.
courts
under
the
apa.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
apa
is
territorial
only,
but
the
ina
precludes
review.
it's
very
much
like...
the
provisions
of
the
ina
show
that
preclusion
is
intended.
it's
very
much
like
block
v.
community
nutrition
where
there
is
a
class
of...
of
applicants
or
claimants,
and
here
it's
aliens
outside
the
united
states,
those
who
have
no
connection
to
our
country
or
our
territory,
who
are
not
given
any
rights...
any
rights
of
access
to
the
courts.
and
to
construe
the
apa
to
nevertheless
provide
them
access
with
the
courts
when
it
historically
has
never
been
done,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
grave
departure
from
our
law,
particularly
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
it's
aliens
outside
the
united
states
who
are
threatening
to
migrate
en
masse
and,
in
fact,
were
migrating
en
masse,
and
they
wish
to
come
into
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
challenge
the
action
of
the
president
in
responding
to
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
think
that
an
apa
action
might
be
appropriate,
equitable
relief
under
these
circumstances
certainly
is
not.
the
president
has
determined
that
the
national
interest
here
is
to
pursue
the
procedures
which
he
has
established,
and
to
suggest
that
the
persons
who
wish
to
avoid
the
207
processing
in
haiti
so
that
they
can
seek
more
beneficial
asylum
procedures
or
what
they
might
view
to
be
more
beneficial
asylum
procedures
in
the
united
states,
does
not
strike
us
as
equitable
relief.
as
this
court
noted
in
webster
v.
doe,
the
court,
when
exercising
powers
under
the
apa,
must
determine
whether
the
relief
requested
is
appropriate
equitable
relief,
and
continues
to
have
authority
to
dismiss
relief,
whether
declaratory
or
injunctive,
that
does
not
represent
an
appropriate
exercise
of
judicial
power.
this
is
certainly
such
a
case,
where
the
president
has
determined
that
to
adopt
the
procedures
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
required
will
result
in
mass
migration
and
the
loss
of
hundreds
and
possibly
thousands
of
lives
at
sea.
this
is
just
not
a
sensible
way
to
construe
our
laws,
and
certainly
not
one
that
we
think
congress
intended.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
1253(h)
is
addressed
only
to
the
attorney
general
because
it
is
only
addressed
to
the
removal
of
aliens
within
our
territory
and
that
is
done
only
by
the
attorney
general.
in
fact,
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
1253(h),
i
mean
not
only
is
it
contained
in
two
chapters
that
pertain
just
to
exclusion
and
deportation
procedures--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--certainly.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
you're
saying
that
we
should
conclude
that
the
president's
authority
was
circumscribed
or
that
he
did
not
have
authority
to
do
this.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
could
construe
it
to
circumscribe
the
president's
authority
in
that...
in
that
light,
especially
since
in
knauff
v.
shaughnessy
itself,
the
president
suspended
exclusion
hearings
which
were
required
by
statute
for
an
alien
bride
who
was
entitled
to
admission
so
that
she
could
be
with
her
husband,
if
she
was
otherwise
admissable.
so
to
say
that...
that
the...
the
president's
powers
could
suspend
those
kinds
of
procedures
in
knauff
but
nevertheless
not
permit
the
president
to
adopt
procedures
that
are
necessary
to
protect
our
sovereignty
and
to
protect
against
a
humanitarian
tragedy
at
sea
seems
to
me
to
be
an
inappropriate
way
to
construe
congressional
intent.
particularly
when
we're
dealing
with
areas
of
foreign
affairs
powers
where,
as
this
court
noted
in
curtis
wright,
congress
is
expected
to
grant
extremely
broad
authority
so
that
the
president
will
be
able
to
act
in
the
national
interest
without
the
kinds
of
limitations
that
you
might
have
in
the
domestic
setting.
i'd
further
underscore
that
if
we
were
to
look
to
the...
the
protocol
to
which
certainly
this
court
has...
has
reference
to
inform
the
interpretation
of
1253(h),
one
of
the
key
concerns
of
the
negotiators
was
that
they
have
the
ability
and
the
flexibility
to
prevent
mass
migrations.
because
no
country
can
readily
give
up
that
kind
of
sovereign
power
so
that
it
subjects
itself
essentially
to
an
invasion
of
foreigners.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
it...
it
was
responded
to
by
the
president,
i
believe
in
july...
in
the
july
11th
negotiating
session
as
well,
saying
that
there
was
no
great...
he
was
responding
to
concerns
that
it
might
be
applied
extraterritorially
and
pointed
out
that
the
second
paragraph
specifically
refers
to
where
the
alien
is
and
that
that
was
a
territorial
limitation.
and,
in
fact,
if
article
33
is
looked
at
in
context,
it's
in
a
chapter
called
administrative
remedies.
and
article
32
refers
to
persons
within
the
territory
who
are
entitled
to
some
limited
protections
from
removal
and...
excuse
me,
32
is
expulsion,
those
who
were
lawfully
admitted.
31
is
people
who
are
entitled
to
a
lesser
level
of
protection,
and
33
is
readily
read
to
simply
describe
the
procedures
that
can
be
used
to
remove
those
people
from
the
territory
and
not
creating
some
sort
of
freestanding
obligation
to
undertake
obligations
outside
the
territory,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
would
create
a
mandatory
duty
of
asylum
which
this
court
in
cardoza-fonseca
and
in
stevic
recognized
no
one
agreed
to.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
there's
a
basic
principle
in
our
law
that
is
reflected
in
johnson
v.
eisentrager,
it's
reflected
in
the
ina,
it's
reflected
in
the
construction
of
243(h)
that
governed
here
for
30
years,
that
ordinarily
an
alien's
right
to
protection
from
a
country
only
arises
when
they
arrive
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
that
aliens
outside
the
united
states
should
not
have
rights
under
u.s.
law
or
access
to
its
courts.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
removal
of
the
language
v.
barber,
that
that
language
meant
it
could
not
apply
in
exclusion
proceedings.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
word
return,
as
judge
walker
notes
in
his
dissent,
had
been
used
as
a
reference
in
statutes
before
to
the
manner
in
which
you
exclude
people
from
the
united
states.
if
the
statute
had
read
deport
or
exclude
to
a
country
where
they
would
be
threatened
with
persecution,
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
so
in
order
to
respond
to
the
concern
that...
that
the
ins
had
that
they'd
like
to
go
ahead
and
extend
it
to
exclusion
proceedings,
they
need
to
add...
take
out
"within
the
united
states"
and
add
another
word.
this
was
done
voluntarily
by
the
ins
when
the
'80
act
was
being
amended.
in
fact,
stevic
and
cardoza-fonseca
say
that
it
is
important
to
look
at
how
the
act
was
being
interpreted
in
the
12-year
period
after
accession
to
the
protocol
and
prior
to
the
amendment,
because
we
should
conclude
that
what
we
were
doing
during
that
12-year
period
was
consistent
with
the
protocol.
and
contrary
to
what
mr.
koh
has
said,
the
ins
in
fact,
and
the
bia
took
the
position
repeatedly
that
243(h)
had
not
been
extended
to
exclusion
proceedings.
in
matter
of
pierre
that
was
settled
by
the
bia,
it
still
during
that
period
applied
only
to
persons
who
were
within
the
united
states,
but
we
believed
that
we
were
in
compliance
with
the
protocol
and,
in
fact,
we
were.
