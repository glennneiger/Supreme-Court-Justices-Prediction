we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number

chris
sale,
acting
commissioner,
and
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
v.
the
haitian
centers
council,
inc.--
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
mahoney,
was
this
directive
aimed
at
any
haitians
who
were
leaving
haiti,
or
just
haitians
who
were
leaving
haiti
for
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
mahoney,
after
the
court
of
appeal's
ruling
last
spring,
was
an
injunction
actually
entered
by
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was...
did
the
injunction...
was
it
directed
against
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
and
the
commandant
of
the
naval
base
at
guantanamo
bay,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
it
command
them
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
mahoney,
does...
does
that
mean
that
if,
say,
a
haitian
appears
at
the
american
consulate
in
port-au-prince
and
makes
a
case
for
political
asylum
and
the
consul
simply
misunderstands
the
law
and
says
there
is
no
case,
does
that
person
then
have
no
remedy
in
the
united
states
courts
unless--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
koh,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
koh,
uh,
uh,
ms.
mahoney
says
that
the
order
is
directed
just
at
haitians
who
are
leaving
haiti
for
the
united
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
are...
are
they...
are
they
out
of
compliance
with
the
president's
order?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
set
up
an
interdiction
order
13
miles
outside
the
united
states
you
turn
people
back
for
what
may
be
a
very
perilous
hundreds
of
miles
of...
of
journey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
have
joined
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
and
the
commandant
of
guantanamo?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
koh,
do
you
agree
with
ms.
mahoney
that
if
a
haitian
makes
an
application
for
political
at
the
consultant
in
port-au-prince,
and
the
consul
does
not
follow
applicable
law
in
processing
it,
that
haitian,
nonetheless,
does
not
have
a
remedy
in
the
united
states
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koh.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
the
case
is
submitted.
