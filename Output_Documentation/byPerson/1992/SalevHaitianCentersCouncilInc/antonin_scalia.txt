justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
legal
issue
in
front
of
us,
though,
i
believe.
the
position
you've
taken
is
that
you
have
no
obligation
to
permit
aliens
to
come
to
the
united
states
in
order
that
they
may
apply
for
asylum
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
we
can
talk
about
that
legal
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
who
directs
the
coast
guard
under
the
current
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
attorney
general
ordinarily
have
jurisdiction
over
the
conduct
of
the
united
states
on
the
high
seas?
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
wouldn't
they
have
a
claim
under
the
apa?
is
the
apa
also
territorial
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
since
it
is
good
for
it
to
be
that
way,
it
must
be
that
way.
is...
is
that
your
argument?
i
mean,
well,
it
seems
that
we
have
a
statute
in
front
of
us,
in
the
text
in
front
of
us,
one
can
create
horribles...
all
sorts
of
horribles,
but
simply
to
acknowledge
it
is
a
horrible
is
not
necessarily
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
law
against
it,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
the
law.
uh...
in...
in...
in...
in
stevic,
we
discussed
the
prior
version
of
1253,
which
we
said
complied
with
article
33
and
the
protocol...
substantially
conformed
with
it.
and
we
said
that
the
later
amendment
made
some
changes,
but
not
substantial
ones.
and
that
prior
version,
which
we
said
complied
with...
uh...
the
protocol,
that
prior
version
read
very
explicitly
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
to
withhold,
disporz...
disportation...
uh...
deportation
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states
to
any
country
in
which,
in
his
opinion,
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
persecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
one
contained
explicitly
a
territorial
limitation.
and
in
stevic
we
thought
that
complied
with
article
33
and
with
the
protocol.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
here's
what
we
said
in
stevic.
we
said
there
were
of
course
differences
between
the
protocol
and
the
text
of
domestic
law.
the
most
significant
difference
was
that
article
33
gave
the
ref...
refugee
an
entitlement
to
avoid
deportation
to
a
country
in
which
his
life
or
freedom
would
be
threatened,
whereas
domestic
law
merely
provided
the
attorney
general
with
discretion.
the
attorney
general,
however,
could
naturally
accommodate
the
protocol...
and
so...
and
it
mentions
a
few
other...
uh...
differences.
you
would
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
if
one
of
the
differences
was
no
extraterritorial
application,
that
would
have
been...
would
have
been
a
prominent
one
that...
that
we
would
have
mentioned.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we
mention
nothing
about
extraterritoriality.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
that
language
leaps
out
at
you,
"within
the
united
states",
in
the
earlier
version.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
we
had
thought
that
that
was
a
difference
from
the
protocol
and
from
article
33,
we
would
certainly
have
noticed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
we
acknowledge
that
even
with
that
language,
before
it
was
removed,
it
was
in
conformity
with
article
33
and
the
protocol.
and
we
also
say
in
the
opinion
that
the
changes
were
not
meant
to
make
any
substantial
changes,
but
were
to
conform
the
law
with
what
the
practice
had
been.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
koh,
could
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
prior
suit.
if...
if,
as
you
say,
the...
the
prior
suit
involved
only
screened-out
haitians,
would
not
the
screened-out
class,
at
least,
be
bound
by
that
prior
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
pardon
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so...
so
whatever
decree
would
come
out
of
this
litigation
would
not...
would
not
apply
to
that
group.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
this
injunction
apply
to
only...
you
know,
only
that
class
and
not
the
other
class.
i
don't
quite
see
how
it
would
work.
