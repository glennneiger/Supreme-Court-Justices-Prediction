justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
mahoney,
you
don't
claim
that
section
1253(h)
is
unconstitutional,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
has
any
effort
been
made
to
amend
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
mahoney,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
on
one
point
before
you
get
too
far
from
it?
isn't
there
a
law
to
the
effect
that
the
coast
guard
is
deemed
legally
to
be
executing
the
policies
of
whatever
department
it
may
be
responsive
to
so
that
if
the
coast
guard
is
implementing
a
policy
which
is
set
by
the
attorney
general
it
would
be
treated
as
the
attorney
general
for
statutory
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
basically
your
argument
is
that
1253(f)
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
issue
that
we've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
1253(h)
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the...
the
powers
over
the
very
subject
matter
that
you
are
describing,
or
the
executive
power
over
the
very
subject
matter
that
you
are
describing
will
be
exercised
only
by
the
attorney
general,
and
is
that
why
1253(h)
is
addressed
only
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i...
just
because
time
is
short--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
interrupt
you
with
another
question.
if,
in
fact,
we
were
to
construe
1253(h)
differently
from
the
way
you
want
us
to
do,
and
if
we
were
to
conclude
that,
in
fact,
1253(h)
does
not
have
the
territorial
limitation
for
which
you
argue,
then
would
it
follow
that
the
statute
was...
was
enacted
on
the
assumption
that
the
authority
over
the
subject
matter...
that
the
executive
power
over
the
subject
matter
would
be
exercised
only
through
the
attorney
general?
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
it
was
circumscribed
and
it's
a
circumscription
which,
at
least
as
a
constitutional
matter,
is
not
presently
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
was...
was
that
concern
expressed
by
others
than
the
dutch
and
the
swiss?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
why
didn't
it
say
so?
i
mean
why
didn't
it
simply
refer
to
exclusion
rather
than
return?
