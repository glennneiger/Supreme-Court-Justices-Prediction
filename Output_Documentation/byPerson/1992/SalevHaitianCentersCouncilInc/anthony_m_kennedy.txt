justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
asylum
screening,
ms.
mahoney,
that's
taking
place
in
haiti
pursuant
to
the
government's
obligations
under
section
1253?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
just
a
gratuitous
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
a
person
in
haiti
is
found
eligible
for
asylum,
what
steps
are
taken
to
allow
him
to
enter
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
conduct
such
extrastatutory...
take
such
extrastatutory
steps?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
if
a
treaty
that
said
it
was
a
self-executing
treaty
had
a
provision
in
which
the
united
states
undertook
not
to
deter
any
person
from
attempting
to
enter
the
united
states,
would
an
alien
then
have
the
authority
to
seek
the
assistance
of
our
courts
to
prohibit
the
president
from
violating
that
treaty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have
any
treaties--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
create
causes
of
action
analogous
to
the
one
we're
discussing
in
this
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
it's
irrelevant
whether
the
treaty
is
self
executing
or
not
self
executing,
because
it's
been
executed
through
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's...
you're...
you're...
it's
not
fatal
to
your
case
to
find
that
the
treaty
is
not
self
executing
because
of
the
statute,
i
take
it.
