mr.
koh,
what
did
the
11th
circuit
think
the
statute
meant,
and
determine
that
it
meant,
in
the
case
that
was
brought
there
in
the
11th
circuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
are
you
going
to
address
any
question
of
collateral
estoppel
in
your
comments
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
read
the
court's
description
of
the
class,
it
certainly
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
people
that
you
have...
uh...
that
you're
representing
today.
