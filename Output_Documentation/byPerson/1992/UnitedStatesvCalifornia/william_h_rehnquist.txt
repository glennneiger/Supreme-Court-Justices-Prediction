chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-2003,
the
united
states
v.
california
and
the
california
state
board
of
equalization.
mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
much
different
circumstances,
mr.
jones.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
cases
that
you
rely
on
involve
a
simple
case
where
the
claim
was
that
the...
the
tax
was
illegal
under
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
presumably
that's
why
it's
here
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
your
funds
have
been
paid
to
the
state
by
your
agent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
take
our
facts,
generally,
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
don't
relitigate
facts
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
jones,
might
there
not
be,
in
that
situation,
one
rule
for
actions
by
the
united
states
against
private
parties
who
may
have
kind
of
absconded
with
government
funds,
as
it
appears
to
have
been
the
case
in
bayne,
and
another
rule
where
the
state
is...
where
the
government
is
simply
protesting
a
collection
that
has
already
been
made
by
a
state
of
taxes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
any
of
those
involve
proceedings
that
involved
the
collection
of
state
taxes
as
opposed
to
private
individuals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
plenary
and
exclusive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
when
you
talk
about
removal,
you're
talking
about
the
united
states
as
a
defendant,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
may
be
the
rule
as
to
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
may
be
quite
different
than
the
rule
as
the
united
states
as
a
plaintiff.
i
mean,
if...
if
the
united
states
is
to...
is
to
be
sued
by
someone
claiming
that
the...
the
government
owes
it
money,
congress
may
quite
likely
have
provided
that
the
suit
is
to
be
heard
in
federal
court,
either
through
removal
or
through
having
been
brought
there
in
the
first
place.
but
i
don't
see
that
says
much
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
government's
claim
to
recover
taxes
in
a
state
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
so-called
federal
right
here
is
simply
a
claim
under
california
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
the
basis
for
that
claim
lies
entirely
in
california
state
tax
law,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
who...
who'd
better
decide
that
case,
the
california
courts
or
the
ninth
circuit,
as
to
whether
a
california
state
tax
is
unlawful
or
not,
under...
under
california
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
california
courts
are
better
equipped
to
speak
on
that
than
the
ninth
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
asking
us
here
to
extend
previous
holdings
of
the
court
to
a
situation
involving
collection
of
state
taxes.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you've...
you've
got
to
answer
questions
like
which
would
be
the
preferable
court
system
to
decide
the
question,
just
as
a
matter
of
policy
since
the
prior
cases
don't
support
what
you're
seeking
to
do
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr....
mr.
jones.
mr.
milam,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
milam.
mr.
milam,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
uh-hum.
what
was
the
first
of
those
cases
you
just
mentioned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dow?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
where
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
give
us
the
citation
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
say--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
why
is
that...
why
is
that
a
problem?
i
this
court
has
never
held...
never
expressed
an
opinion
one
way
or
the
other,
why
does
that
prevent
you
from
urging
it
to
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
want
to
have
several
strings
to
your
bow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
milam.
mr.
jones,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
the
only
question
this
court
decided
was
whether
interest
would
be
available,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nobody
was
arguing
otherwise
in
that
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean
judge...
i
don't
claim
to
have
been
present
at
the
argument.
i'm
just
saying
from
the
opinion
it
doesn't
appear
that
anyone
was
arguing
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
