justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
jones,
who's
the
taxpayer
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
do
you
say
is
the
taxpayer
here?
you
don't
think
the
government's
the
taxpayer,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
federal
funds
reimbursed
the
contractor
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
united
states
v.
new
mexico
do
you
think
we
thought
the
united
states
was
the
taxpayer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
said
it
didn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
united
states
is
in
no
better
position
here,
i
assume,
than
in
new
mexico.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
maybe
you're
just
in
the
position
of...
of
being
subrogated
to
whatever
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
was.
if
the
taxpayer
is
the...
the
contractor,
then
maybe
the
united
states
stands...
stands
in
those
shoes
for
purposes
of
litigating
this
question,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
let
me
just
press
one...
one
more
question
here.
on
your
theory
that
the
united
states
is
the
primary
party
here,
do
you
think
that
the
california...
that
the
federal
contractor
had
standing
to
proceed
with
its
litigation
in
state
court,
claiming
the
money?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
your
theory
here,
it
wouldn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
assume
you
could.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
second
is
united
states
versus
california,
which
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
state
of
california
assessed
approximately
$14
million
in
sales
and
use
taxes
against
a
federal
contractor.
under
the
federal
contract
that
government
paid
the
contractor
an
annual
fixed
fee
and
also
paid
its
costs
including
moneys
to
cover
the
state
taxes.
at
the
government's
direction,
the
contractor
protested
the
assessment
of
the
state
taxes
first
in
administrative
proceedings
and
later
in
state
court
proceedings.
in
january
1988,
the
contractor
and
state
agreed
to
a
$3
million
refund
and
to
dismissal
of
the
actions
without
prejudice.
in
may
1988,
the
federal
government
filed
this
suit
in
federal
district
court
seeking
refund
of
$11
million
in
a
declaratory
judgment
that
california
had
classified
and
taxed
the
contractor
erroneously
under
state
law.
the
district
court
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
it
was
entitled
to
recover
using
the
federal
common
law
action
for
money
had
and
received
and
gave
summary
judgment
for
the
state.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
new
mexico,
we
held
the
federal
contractors
were
not
immune
from
state
taxation
simply
because
the
government
shouldered
the
entire
economic
burden
of
the
levy.
the
contract
here
is
in
all
relevant
respects
like
the
contracts
that
we
discussed
in
united
states
versus
new
mexico,
it
is
clear
that
california
taxed
the
contractor
not
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government's
voluntary
agreement
to
pay
the
taxes
does
not
make
those
payments
a
direct
disbursement
of
federal
funds
to
the
state.
the
federal
government
may
not
convert
an
obligation
to
indemnify
its
contractor
into
a
right
to
proceed
under
the
federal
common
law
action
for
money
had
and
received.
because
that
government
indemnified
the
contractor,
it
did
have
the
right
to
be
subrogated
to
the
contractor's
claims
against
the
state.
under
traditional
principles
of
subrogation,
however,
the
subrogate
takes
no
more
rights
than
a
subrogor
had.
in
this
case,
once
the
contractor
dismissed
its
state
law
causes
of
action,
it
no
longer
had
the
right
to
sue
because
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
in
california.
the
federal
government
argues
it
is
not
subject
to
the
state
statutes
of
limitation.
but
in
the
case
of
guaranty
trust
company
against
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
even
if
that
were
true
the
principle
did
not
apply
when
the
government
acquired
by
a
right
of
assignment
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
against
the
assignor.
although
the
government
acquired
a
right
to
be
subrogated
to
the
contractor's
claims
when
it
paid
the
amount
of
the
taxes,
it
was
not
subrogated
for
those
claims
until
it
filed
a
proceeding
in
federal
court.
by
then,
the
state
statute
of
limitations
had
run.
thus,
the
government
was
not
subrogated
to
"a
right
free
of
a
pre-existing
infirmity".
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
