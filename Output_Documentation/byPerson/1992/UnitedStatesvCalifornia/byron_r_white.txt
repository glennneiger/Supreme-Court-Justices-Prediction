justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
claim
any
sovereign
immunity
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
either
for
yourself
or
for
the
contractor.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
have
stopped
your
contractor
from
settling
this
case?
it
didn't
go
to
the...
it
didn't
go
to
conclusion
and
decide
the
very
issue
that...
that
the
contractor
had
raised.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
have...
could
you
have
forbidden
the...
your
contractor
from
settling
that
case
and...
and
instead,
litigating
it
to
its
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
could,
you
just...
you
just
blew
it,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it...
but
it
was
dismissed
without
prejudice,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could...
under
the
california
rule,
you
could
not
have
intervened
in
the
proceedings
that
your
contractor
had
instituted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you...
what
if
you
got
into
court
on
this
suit
that...
that
you
think
the
federal
court
can
hear,
and
it
suddenly
happens
that
a
supreme...
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
found
that
squarely
decides
the
issue
that
you
want
litigated
against
you?
now--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
a
matter
of
state
law,
then,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
sure.
and
you...
and
you
would
be
stuck
with
it.
so...
so...
so
you
really
are
wanting
to
litigate
an
issue
of
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
there's
a...
a
state
supreme
court
case
that's...
that
is
so
similar
to
this
that
anyone
would
say
it
would
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
could
the...
you
say
the
government
did
control
this
case,
but
could
it
formally
have
intervened
under
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
it
get
to...
it
never
got
beyond
the
administrative
stage,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the...
well,
the
contractor
wanted
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it...
and
it...
and
it
employed
the
administrative
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it...
did
it...
it
never
got
to
court,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
were...
and
those
were
settled?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
some
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--no,
no,
no.
well,
but
nevertheless,
did...
did
the
contractor
raise
the
issue
that
the
united
states
wants
to
litigate?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
and
so
that
issue
never
went
to
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think...
and...
and...
you
think
the
united
states
could
have
intervened
in
those
two
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
lost
in
the...
in
the
trial
court
on
the
issue
they
wanted
to
litigate,
they
could
have
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
was...
was
mr.
jones
correct
in
saying
that
the...
the
state
was
told
that...
when
the
case
was
dismissed
or
the
cases
were
dismissed,
that
the
united
states
was
going
to
pursue
the
issue
in
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
suppose
the
state
could
have...
could
have
refused
to
have
the
case
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
after
the
case
has...
even
after
discovery
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you're...
you're
saying
that
this
so-called
common
law
cause
of
action
the
government
relies
on
just
doesn't
apply
in
the...
the
state
tax
context.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
several
court
of
appeals
cases
that...
to
the
contrary
to
your
position,
aren't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
uh-hum.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-hum.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
the
ones
on
the
government's
brief
page
20,
i
think,
yeah,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
suggested,
that
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
notion
that
the
united
states
was
the
real
party
in
interest
and
could
have
and
should
have
intervened.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
the
united
states
the
real
party
in
interest
if
it
isn't
its
money
that's
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
