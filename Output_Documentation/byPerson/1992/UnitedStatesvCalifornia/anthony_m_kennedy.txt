justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
incorrect
to
say
that
the
state
is
indebted
to
the
contractor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
this
case
had
proceeded
with
the
contractor's
claim
being
adjudicated
and
there
was
a
final
judgment
in
the
california
courts
as
to
the
contractor
and
that
judgment
was
in
favor
of
the
state,
adverse
to
the
contractor,
would
you
still
have
the
right
to
maintain
this
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
you
did
here,
incidently,
did
you
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
did
at
the
administrative
level.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
didn't
you
pay
the...
didn't
you
pay
the
attorneys,
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
apply
even
if
the
united
states
is
subrogated
to
the
claim
and
proceeds
in
a
subrogation
capacity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
the
united
states
could
have
intervened
at
any
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
would
it
have
had
the...
the
right
also,
in
your
view,
to
intervene
in
the
administrative
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
have
had
the
same
right
to
intervene
in
the
administrative
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the--
--at
least
one
egg
out
of
a
half
a
dozen.
[laughter]
i'm
not
sure...
the
state's...
the
government's
proceeding
on
a
common
law
count
for
money
had
and
received.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
is...
was
that
an
equitable
action
at
common
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
it
was
not,
which
is
what...
why
i'm
not
sure
why
you
say
that
equity
requires
that
it
follows
exhaustion
of
remedy.
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
remedies
to
sue
for
money
had
and
received,
do
you?
what's
your
authority
for
that?
