mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
federal
common
law
action
for
money
had
and
received
was
brought
by
the
united
states
to
recover
$11
million
in
public
funds
paid
to
the
state
of
california
as
taxes
by
the
manager
of
the
naval
petroleum
reserve.
the
manager
is
a
federal
contractor
who
operates
under
an
advance-funding,
cost-reimbursement
arrangement
with
the
united
states.
the
state
taxes
were
assessed
with
respect
to
purchases
of
personal
property
made
by
the
manager
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
contends
that
the
taxes
were
erroneously
and
unlawfully
assessed.
the
courts
below
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
state
tax.
they
acknowledged
that
the
united
states
has
a
federal
common
law
right
to
recover
unlawful
payments
of
state
taxes,
but
they
held
that
the
federal
cause
of
action
was
inapplicable
in
this
case
because
the
united
states
had
not
pursued
administrative
tax
refund
procedures
available
under
state
law
and
had
not
brought
its
judicial
challenge
to
the
state
tax
within
the
90
days
provided
by
state
law.
in
our
view,
and
in
the
unanimous
view
of
six
other
courts
of
appeals,
the
federal
common
law
right
of
the
united
states
to
recover
public
funds
that
have
been
unlawfully
obtained
is
not
subject
to
compliance
with
the
state
procedures
applicable
to
state
law
tax
refund
suits.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
there
is
no
basis,
or
rationale
even,
for
distinguishing
in
that
sense,
justice
souter.
the
common
law
action
for
money
had
and
received
was
designed
by
this
court
to
protect
the
united
states,
to
prevent
and
remedy
unlawful
takings
of
public
monies.
whether...
or
the
way
that
it
seems
most
direct
to
state
it
is
that
under
federal
common
law,
if
federal
funds
have
been
taken
without
lawful
justification,
they
must
be
returned.
it
is
for
the
person
who
has
taken
the
funds
to
establish
the
lawful
basis.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
california
proposes
that
the
lawful
basis
for
its
taking
of
the
funds
is
the
state
tax
law.
our
position
is
that
the
state
tax
law
does
not
provide
a
lawful
basis.
we
would
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
other
takings
of
public
property
with
respect
to
which
we
think
there
is
no
lawful
justification.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
as
california
uses
that
term,
the
taxpayer
is
the
federal
manager
of
the
naval
petroleum
reserve.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in...
there's
two
ways
to
answer
that;
one
is
factually
and
the
second
is
conceptually.
factually,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
was
correct
in
saying
so,
that
these
taxes
were
paid
with
federal
funds.
that's
at
page--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--actually,
it
was
something
more
than
that.
as
you
would
see
looking
at
page
142
of
the
joint
appendix,
this
is
actually
federal
funds
that
were
paid
directly
to
the
state.
there
was...
this
is
an
advanced
funding
arrangement
of
the
type
the
court
discussed
in
the
united
states
v.
new
mexico
case.
these--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
know
if...
if
that
question,
framed
that
way,
was
before
the
court.
what
was
at
issue
in
united
states
v.
new
mexico
was
whether
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
from
state
taxes
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
what
the
court
held
in
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
court
held
that
it
did
not
apply
in
that
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
are
in
a
better
position
here.
our
contention
is
that
there
is
no
lawful
basis
for
the
state
tax
to
be
applied
to
us.
the...
we're
not
contending--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we're
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
are
not
contending
the
tax
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
however,
as...
just
to
inform
the
court
and
not
because
it's
instrumental
in
our
argument,
the
state's
tax
is
shaped
with
constitutional
constraints
in
mind.
the
state
has
crafted
a
tax
that
applies
only
to
federal
contractors
and
applies
to
them
differently
than
it
would
to
other
types
of
contractors,
and
it
does
so
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
but
our
position
is
that
the
state
tax
is
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
that
is
another
way
it's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well
that,
of
course,
is
the
state's
position.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
bit
of
a
chicken
and
an
egg
problem
here.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and...
and
it's
a
little
glib
to
say
it,
but
nonetheless
i
think
there's
an
element
of
truth;
it's
a
federal
chicken
and
a
state
egg,
and
under
the
supremacy
clause
the
chicken
prevails.
and
in
our
view,
the
chicken
is
the
common
law
right
that
this
court
has
recognized
in...
consistently,
that
the
united...
that
anyone
who
takes
federal
funds
has
to
have
a
lawful
justification.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
this
is
the
first
time
this
issue
has
come
to
this
court,
but
it's
been
in
the
courts
of
appeals
for
decades.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
this
is
the
first
time
this
court
has
had
to
decide
whether
a
lawful
justification
exists
when
the
state
has
taken
our
funds
under
an...
made
an
unlawful...
an
illegal
assessment
of
our
funds.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
exactly
the
context
of
the
bayne
case
in
1876,
where
a
federal
officer
had
federal
funds,
he
misappropriated
those
funds
and
transmitted
them
to
a
third
party.
this
court
allowed
the
united
states
to
recover
directly
from
the
third
party
the
funds
that
had
been
unlawfully
obtained
by
that
party.
here
too,
the
court
has
to
assume,
on
the
record
of
this
case,
that
the
state
tax
is
unlawful,
that
the
state
has...
has
no
lawful
justification
for
the
taking
of
the
funds.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
hear
you.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
except
that
here
the...
this
case
falls
with...
does
fall
within
the
confines
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
that
the
funds
were
paid
under
protest
and
under
threat
of
penalty.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
taxpayer
voluntarily
made
the
payment
and
then
came
back
years
later
and
said
by
the
way,
i
don't
think
i
should
have
been
required
to.
what
the
court
has
held
is
that
when...
when
the
taxes
have
been
paid
under
protest
and
under
threat
of
penalty,
that
it
is
not
regarded
as
a
voluntary
payment
and
that
it
can...
the
federal
government,
the
common
law
action
applies
to
recovery
of
the
funds.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
bend
v.
hoyt
addresses
that
subject.
i
am
relatively
sure
city
of
philadelphia
v.
collector
does.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
under
california
law,
the
contractor
is
what
is
called
the
taxpayer.
i
am
just
talking
now
about
california...
the
way
california
describes
the
situation,
and
the
united
states
is
called
the
real
party
in
interest.
california
says
that
the
real
party
in
interest
is
not
allowed
to
bring
a
suit
to
recover
the
refund,
only
the
taxpayer
may.
as
a
result,
the
united
states
has
no
remedy
under
state
law.
california
does
not
recognize
any
claim
of
the
united
states.
the
only
exception
that
the
california
courts
have
described
to
that
standing
rule
is
when,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
taxpayer
is
required
by
law,
as
a
condition
of
receiving
the
refund,
to
pass
the
refund
through
to
the
real
party
in
interest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
would
then
have
the
problem
that
the
court,
i
believe,
addressed
in
the
montana
case
about
collateral
estoppel.
and
i
think
it's
relevant
to
point
out...
and
we
would
be
bound
if
we
had
participated
in
the
litigation
and...
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
but
the...
the
state
court
litigation
here
did
not
proceed
to
conclusion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
we
participated
in
any
manner
at
the
administrative
level;
we
had
no
right
to.
the
contractor
made
that
protest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
under
our
contract
we
had
a
duty
to
reimburse
them
for
the
costs.
but
i
believe
that...
that...
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
don't
recall
the
page...
the
counsel
who
was
representing
the
contractor
said
quite
clearly
he
had
no
authority
to
represent
the
united
states.
he
was
there--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
settle...
the
settlement
of
the
claim
presents
a
different
issue
than...
than
collateral
estoppel.
the
united
states,
in
our
view,
has
an
independent
federal
cause
of
action
that
the
contractor
cannot
settle.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
could
we
have
forbidden
them
from
settling
it?
i,
frankly,
don't
know
the
answer.
and
it's
normal
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
this
case
wasn't
settled
in
that
respect
below.
what
was
done
in
the
state
courts
was
that
the
state
acknowledged
that
a
certain
portion
of
its
taxes
were
improper;
the
remaining
portion
was
still
being
disputed.
the
record
reflects
that
the
contractor
then
advised
the
state
that
they
had
decided
to
dismiss
the
contractor's
claim
and
that
the
united
states
would
then
commence
a
suit
in
federal
court.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
seem
to
be
aware
of
that.
it
sort
of
made
it
sound
like
we
made
a
tactical
decision--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--to
settle
something
and
then
sneak
it
away.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
at
least--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
anything
on
that.
it's
just
reading
between
the
lines,
it
seemed
to
be
the
tenor
of
the
court's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
was
dismissed
without
prejudice
and
at
page
97
of
the
joint
appendix
there's
a
letter
between
counsel
that
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
state
was
aware
that
the
united
states
was
going
to
pursue
the
claim
in
federal
court.
claims
of
the
united
states
involving
public
funds
inherently
implicate
an
important
national
interest.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
it
was
in
state
court,
under
the
state
rules
it
had
standing.
the
state
rule
is
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
believe
there's...
there's
two
separate
causes
of
action.
california
law
recognizes
a
cause
of
action
for
the
putative
taxpayer,
and
allows
them
standing
to
pursue
it
only
in
state
court.
this
court
has
recognized
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
for
the
united
states,
which
we
think
is
a
separate
cause
of
action
that,
under
28
usc
1345,
falls
within
the
plenary
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
there
is
no
dispute
we
are
the
real
party
at
interest,
that
these
were
paid
with
federal
funds;
all
of
the
elements
of
the
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
have
been
met.
i
would
just
like
to
take
a
minute
to
explain
what
i
think
is
the
background
of
that
action,
although
it
may
be
apparent
by
now.
as
the
court
held
in
the
chesapeake
&
delaware
canal
company
case,
even
when
commercial
transactions
such
as
stock
dividend
payments
are
involved,
when
the
united
states
seeks
to
recover
public
funds
it
is,
quote,
acting
in
its
governmental
capacity
as
much
as
if
it
were
collecting
taxes.
the
court
has
thus
consistently
concluded,
as
it
stated
in
clearfield
trust,
that
it
is
for
the
federal
courts
to
fashion
the
rules
governing
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
united
states
in
its
financial
and
proprietary
transactions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
only
orderly
way
in
which
we
can
protest
that
collection
is
to
subject
ourselves
to
the
risk
of
penalties
and
compulsory
process
at
state
law,
or
to
bring...
to
make
the
payment
in
an
orderly
fashion,
as
this
court
has...
has
held
in...
in
the
courts
i
cited...
in
the
cases
i
cited
to
justice
souter.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
actually,
the
common
law
rule
has
its
roots
in
those
two
cases
i
cited
that
involve
suits
to
recover
federal
taxes.
this
court
has
held...
held
at
common
law
that
individuals
could
recover
federal
taxes
from
the
united
states,
even
though
they
had
been
voluntarily
paid,
because
it
was
the
orderly
thing
to
do,
i
suppose.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
was
no
statutory
remedy
at
that
time,
although
i
suppose
that
the
taxpayer
could
have
resisted
the
assessment
and
not
voluntarily--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--california
cases
seem
to
assume
we
can
intervene.
we
could...
but
we
would--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
they
assume
that
we
could
intervene,
and
there's
no
authority,
really,
that
answers
that
question.
but
i
also
assume,
because
there
isn't
any...
any
case
law
to
the
contrary,
that
we
could
assume...
we
could
intervene,
but
we
would
be
intervening
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
would
be
intervening
in
a
proceeding
that
would
make
the
federal
claims
subject
to
state
law
procedures,
to
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
and
to
state
court
adjudication
of
the
claim.
and
those
results
are
inconsistent
with
this
court's
recognized
need
for
uniform
rules
to
govern
the
claims
of
the
united
states,
in
particular
with
28
usc
2415,
which
provides
a
6-year
statute
of
limitations
for
claims
by
the
united
states
arising
under
contract,
express
or
implied,
in
law.
requiring
us
to
proceed
in
state
court
as
an
intervenor
would
also
conflict
with
28
usc
1345,
under
which
congress
has
given
the
federal
courts
plenary
jurisdiction
over
claims
by
the
united
states.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
exclusive
through
the
removal
procedure...
not
expressly,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
pragmatically
exclusive
through
the
removal
procedure.
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
have
its
claims
adjudicated
in
federal
courts.
congress
has
determined
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
united
states
has...
has
the
option
in
every
case
to
have
its
claims
heard
in
federal
court.
no
party
has
the
option
to
require
the
united
states
to
have
its
claims
heard
anywhere
else.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
28
usc
1345
gives
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
all,
and
that's
the
statutory
word,
all
causes
of
action,
suits,
or
proceedings
commenced
by
the
united
states.
it
is
as
broad
and
plenary
a
jurisdiction
as
congress
has
provided.
congress
obviously
intended
that
the
claims
of
the
united
states
would
be
adjudicatable
or
adjudicated
in
federal
courts.
there
is
no
basis
under
the
federal
common
law
remedy
for
requiring
the
federal
cause
of
action
of
the
united
states
to
be
adjudicated
in
state
court.
i
should
make
emphatic
what
i...
i
said
indirectly
about
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
has
held
on
several
occasions
that
the
federal
claims
of
the
united
states,
and
in
particular
the
federal
common
law
action
for
money
had
and
received,
is
not
subject
to
state
statutes
of
limitations.
in
1966,
congress
enacted
a
statute
that
expressly
provides
for
every
action
for
money
damages
brought
by
the
united
states
for
contracts
implied
at
law
to
be
given
a
6-year
federal
statute
of
limitations.
the
federal
statute
of
limitations
applies
directly
to
the
quasi-contractual
claim
of
the
united
states.
the
statute
legislatively
fills
the
gap
created
by
this
court's
decisions
rejecting
state
law
rules
of
limitation
for
the
federal
claims.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
the...
i
take
it
the
premise
of
that
question
is
there
are
two
causes
of
action.
the
united
states
has
its
federal
cause
of
action;
the
united
states
also,
under
the
state's
theory,
could
be
subrogated
to
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
the
answer
to
your
question
turns
on
the
character
of
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
at
least
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
in
a
series
of
cases
not
at
issue
here
today.
the
ninth
circuit
has
suggested
that
when
the
state
statute
incorporates
the
limitations
period
as
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
then
compliance
with
the
state
statute
of
limitations
is
necessary
to
give
rise
to
the
cause
of
action.
we
think
it
apparent...
although
that
issue
isn't
presented
here,
we
think
it
apparent
that
this
state
statute
of
limitations
does
not
incorporate
compliance
with
the
state
period
as
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
to
the
contrary,
what
the
state
statute
of
limitations
says
is
that
failure
to
bring
suit
within
90
days
will
be
deemed
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
state
claim,
so
it
is
a
traditional
or
more
traditional
state
statute
of
limitations.
so
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is
if
we
had
proceeded
under
state
law,
we
would
not
be
subject
to
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
the
6-year
federal
statute
of
limitations
would
apply,
but
the
case
hasn't
been
presented
on
that
basis
in
the
lower
courts.
the
state's
argument
takes
a
somewhat
different
tack.
they
don't
join
the
contention
that
we
should
be
required
to
exhaust
a
nonexisting
remedy.
they
instead
contend
that
we
should
be
required
to
resort
to
the
state
process.
for
the
reasons
i've
already
described,
that
conflicts
with
well
established
rules
requiring
federal
rules
to
govern
federal
actions.
but
i
should
also
point
out
that
it
would
make
the
public
right
of
the
united
states
to
recover
public
funds
turn
on
the
perseverance
of
federal
contractors
who
ultimately
have
no
stake
in
the
outcome,
and
who
operate
under
an
enormous
variety
of
tax
procedures
in
literally
thousands
of
local
taxing
jurisdictions.
in
clearfield
trust
the
court
concluded
that
because
united
states
transactions
proceed
upon
such
a
vast
scale,
the
federal
right
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
exceptional
uncertainties
imposed
by
the
vagaries
of
the
state
law
rules.
finally,
i
do
want
to
address
the
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
the
court
has--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
claims
of
the
united
states
differ
both
in
quality
and
quantity
in
that
respect.
the
united
states
as
the
sovereign,
should
not
be
subjected
to
state
law
rules
that
limit
federal
rights.
i
think
the
court
looks
at
it
from
that
perspective.
i
believe
it
is
also
true
that
it
is...
it
is
comparing
apples
and
oranges
to
compare
even
a
large
corporation
with
the
pervasive
and
extensive
reach
of
the
federal
government
throughout
every
city,
county,
and
state.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
a
claim
under
federal
law.
it
is
a
claim
that
the
state
has
taken
money
without
lawful
justification.
it
is
a
claim
under
federal
common
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
put
it
the
other
way.
i
would
state...
say
that
the
basis
for
the
state's
defense,
the
basis
for
the
state's
assertion
that,
in
fact,
it
took
the
monies
lawfully,
lies
in
its
claim
under
state
law.
that
is
a
claim
that
we...
we
disagree
with
and
that
the
court,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
must
assume
is
incorrect.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
court
must
assume
the
state
tax
is
unlawful
and
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well
this...
there
certainly
has
never--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there's
no
question
that
the
federal
courts
have
competence
to
decide
these
questions
of
state
law.
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
the
prudential
one
that
you're
framing,
is
whether
the...
as
a
matter
of
comity
or
abstention,
the
state
courts
should
decide
these
federal
claims.
the
comity
doctrine,
as
applied
in
fair
assessment,
stems
from
the
anti-injunction
act
and...
and
the
conclusion
that
congress
didn't
intend
jurisdiction
to
reach
state
tax
rules.
but
the...
but
the
anti-injunction
act,
by
this
court's
decision
in
department
of
employment,
does
not
apply
to
the
united
states.
and
to
the
contrary,
congress
gave
the
federal
courts
plenary
jurisdiction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
think
the
case...
this
court's
cases
do
support
it.
and
as
a
matter
of...
and
as
a
policy
matter...
the
two
policy
sources
that
i
can
refer
the
court
to...
this
court
has
plenary
jurisdiction
over
claims
of
the
united
states;
it
doesn't
have
that
kind
of
jurisdiction
for
anyone
else.
and
secondly,
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
apply
to
the
united
states.
in
the
department
of
employment
case,
this
court
sustained
a
holding
that
the
united
states
could
enjoin
a
state
tax
and
recover
damages.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
would
expect
the
federal
court
to
look
for
sources
of
state
law
here,
just
as
it
does
in
any
other
case
where
it
decides
questions
of
state
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
actually,
we
want
to
litigate
facts
as
well.
we
want
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
the
contractor
under
our
federal
contract
is
a
construction
contractor.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
are
factual
questions
and
legal
questions
that
implicate
the
rights
of
the
united
states,
and
we
think
they
should
be
decided
in
federal
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
that
event,
i
suppose
the
district
court
properly
should
decide
that
there
was
a
lawful
justification
of
public
funds.
but
on
this
record,
this
court
has
to
assume
there
was
no
lawful
justification.
and
i
want
to...
i
should
point
out,
just
in...
that
in
the
board
of
county
commissioners
case
the
court
emphasized
that
nothing...
and
i
think
i
quoting...
nothing
that
the
state
can
do
will
be
allowed
to
destroy
the
federal
right,
which
is
to
be
vindicated.
and
our
point
is
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
determine
our
federal
right
under
the
federal
common
law
in
federal
courts.
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
excuse
me.
federal...
federal
common
law
has
been
applied
to
actions
brought
by
the
united
states
to
recover
states
taxes.
this
is
not
the
first
case
of
this
type.
board
of
county
commissioners
was
a
suit
by
the
united
states
to
recover
taxes
paid
to
the
state
of
kansas.
i
just--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
the
only
question
the
court
decided,
but
it's
not
the
only
question
the
court
discussed
and
addressed.
the
court
specified
the
fact
that
federal
common
law
creates
the
remedy
and...
and
governs
the
choice
of
the...
of
the
rules
to
apply.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i...
i
assume
that's
correct,
but
i
don't
know,
i
wasn't
up
there.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
opinion
discusses
the
issues
as
if
they
were
relevant
to
its
decision,
and
so
i
assume
that
those
issues
were
discussed
before
the
court.
but
as
far...
i'm
just
being
honest...
in
terms
of
what
was
actually
presented
to
the
court,
i'm...
i'm
not
certain.
the
second
point
is
that
common...
at
common
law,
at...
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
was
not
required.
the
city
of
philadelphia
v.
collector,
this
court's
decision
specifically
rejected
a
suggestion
that
the
federal
remedy
should
not
be
available
because
there
was
an
administrative
procedure
not
exhausted.
the
court
said
there
was
no
support
for
that
proposition.
