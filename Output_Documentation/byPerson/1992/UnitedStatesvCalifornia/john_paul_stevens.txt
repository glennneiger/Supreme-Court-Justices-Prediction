justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
does
that
really
make
any
difference?
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
establish
that
the
government
controlled
the
case,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
that's
kind
of
running
through
my
mind
about
the
analogy
with
the
litigation
costs
and
all?
suppose...
the
united
states
under
the
contract
had
to
pay
the
attorneys
fees,
i
think,
did
it
not,
of
the
contractor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if...
if
they
were
persuaded
that
the
attorney
had
overcharged
the
client
and
they
wanted
to
recover
the
overcharge
from
the
client,
would
they...
and...
and
the
california
statute
of
limitations
had
run,
would
they
be
able
to
sue
in
federal
court,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
the
same
question
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
it's
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
it
overcharges
a
matter...
say
there's
some
state
rule
you
don't
charge
unreasonable
fees,
or
something
like
that.
and
the
united
states
basically
is
a
subrogee
to
the
contractor,
trying
to
get
back,
on
a
state
cause
of
action,
an
excess
charge.
and
here...
here
the
contractor
gave
too
much
money
to
the
tax
collector,
and
it
also
gave
too
much
money
to
its
lawyer.
why
are
they
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
have
the
sovereign
power
to
decide
how
much...
what
is
a
fair
fee
for
a
lawyer,
i
guess,
a
member
of
the
state
bar,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
but
you
think
that's
different?
