justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jones,
is...
should
we
make
a
distinction
in
the
kinds
of
unlawfulness
that
may
be
appropriate
predicates
for
that
common
law
action?
there
was
nothing
unlawful
in
the
sense
of
being
either
criminal
or
mistaken
or
tortious.
the
unlawfulness
here,
on
your
view,
is
simply
an
unlawfulness
in
the
sense
that
if
the
taxability
issue
were
litigated
as
far
as
it
could
be
litigated
on
the
merits,
the
united
states
would
win
and
california
would
not.
but
should
we
distinguish
between
those
two
senses
of
unlawful?
and
if
we
do,
are
you
in
trouble
under
the
common
law
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
certainly
cannot
assume
that
the
funds
were
unlawfully
taken
from
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
in...
in
the
bayne
case
the
funds
were
unlawfully
taken
by
the
federal
officer
from
the
united
states,
they
were
misappropriated,
as
i
recall.
so
the
united
states
stood,
in
seeking
a
quasi-contractual
remedy,
in
a
very
stronger
position
than
the
united
states
stands
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
so
you've
got...
you've
got
the
better
of
me
on
that
legal
point.
what's
your
best
case
for
that
proposition?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
there
any
other
process
for
doing
so
at
that
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
accept
the
premise
of
its
being
federal
property?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
let's...
let's
go
back
to
the
cause
of
action
again
for
a
moment.
mr.
jones
relied
heavily
on...
on
the
bend
&
hoyt
and
the
city
of
philadelphia
case.
do
you
accept
them
as
being
in
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
i
thought...
i
looked
at
them
very
quickly.
i
thought
they
did,
but
do
you...
can
you
think
of
any
basis
to
distinguish
them
from
the...
from
the
case
that
you've
got
today?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
