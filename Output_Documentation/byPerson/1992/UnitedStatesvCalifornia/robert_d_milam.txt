mr.
robert
d.
milam
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
contractor's
attorney
disclaimed
any
representation
of
the
united
states,
the
joint
appendix
is
clear
that
the
united
stakes...
states
directed
and
controlled
that
action.
not
only
at
joint
appendix
pages
131
and
135
does
it
show
that...
the
united
states
obligated
to
pay
the
contractor's
attorney,
at
joint
appendix
page
58
the
wbec
attorney
told
the
board
of
equalization
at
the
hearing
on
petition...
at
the
petition
for
redetermination
that
the
united
states
was
instructing
wbec
as
to
each
step
in
the
process.
joint
appendix
pages
59
and
60
show
that
the
united...
the
wbec
attorney
told
the
board
of
equalization
at
that
same
hearing
that
he
had
been
not
authorized
to
discuss
a
certain
subject
with
the
board.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
agree.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
your
honor,
under...
under
the
judicial
remedy,
the
code
of
civil
procedure,
section,
i
think,
389,
authorizes
and
almost
requires
a
real
party
in
interest
to
be
before
the
court.
and
as
to
the
judicial
remedy,
i
believe
it
could
have
intervened
under
that
section.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
don't
understand
the
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
right.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
wbec
filed
two
court
actions
in
state
court,
yes,
at
the
direction
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
those
were
not...
i
agree
with
mr.
jones'
characterization
of
that,
that
the...
the
board
of
equalization,
through
discovery,
found
that
it
had--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--misapplied
the
tax
to
some
extent.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
and
so
they
agreed
to
pay
that
back.
and
the
result
of
that
was
the
dismissal
of
the
suit
by...
of
the
two
suits
by
wbec.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
there
was
no
settlement,
as
such.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
yes.
the...
the
issues
before
the
state
courts
would
be
the
same
issues
before
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
it
was...
the
cases
were
dismissed.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--yes,
i
believe
that.
also,
i
believe,
contrary
to
mr.
jones,
that
the
united
states,
under
circumstances
of
this
case,
could
have
had
an
administrative
remedy
also...
could
have...
could
have
filed
a
claim
for
refund
and
pursued
administrative
remedy.
there
are
circumstances
when
that...
that
would
not
be
possible,
but
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
cannot
identify
any
other
instances.
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
when
state
taxes
are
at
issue,
the
state
and
state
courts
have
a
tremendous
interest
in...
in
resolving
those
issues,
but
i
cannot
cite
another
case
to...
to
support
that.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
that...
the
money
was...
was
paid
from
federal
funds.
now,
whether
they
want
federal
property
back
or
not,
i
really
don't
know,
because
wbec
was
a
taxpayer,
we
assessed
the
taxpayer,
and
they
had
some
mechanism
to...
to
pay
the
money
with
federal
funds.
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
they
want
federal
funds
back,
but
i...
i
don't
know
how
to
resolve
that...
that
argument
of
theirs.
this
was...
the
state
court
suits
were
an
action...
was
an
action...
were
actions
by
a
state
taxpayer,
wbec,
against
the
taxing
entity
that
imposed
the
taxes,
and
the
only
issue
was
the
application
of
state
tax
law.
and
this
court
has
often
held--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--i
think
he
cited
something
in
the
joint
appendix.
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
but
he...
he
cited
something
in
the
joint
appendix
that
i'm
not
aware
of.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
no,
i
think
dismissal
is...
is
a
duty.
i
mean
it...
it
is
a
right
of
a
party
who
brought
the
suit
and...
and
actually
under
california
law
it's
very
difficult
to...
almost
impossible
to
contest
that.
if
they
want
to
dismiss
without
prejudice,
they
are
allowed
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
yes.
i
had...
to
give
you
an
example,
i
had
one
case
on
appeal
where
i
had...
in
the
california
courts...
where
i
had
filed
my
respondent's
brief
after
the
appellant's
brief
had
been
filed.
and
after
i
filed
my
respondent's
brief,
the
court
allowed
the
taxpayer
to
dismiss
the...
the
appeal
over...
over
my
protest.
but
the...
the
opportunity
to...
to
dismiss
the
case
is
very
broad
in
california.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
yes,
your
honor.
the
united...
under
section
389
of
the
code
of
civil
procedure,
a
real
party
in
interest
has
the
right
to
be
before
the
california
courts.
in
fact,
i
think
they're
almost
required
to
be
before
the
california
courts.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
they
could
have
either
intervened,
stepped
into
the
shoes,
or,
on
their
own,
pursued
the
administrative
remedies.
as
i
said,
that's
not
always
the
case
if
the
circumstances
were
different.
but
they
could
have
done
both
in
this
case.
this
court
has
often
held
that
in
the
interests
of
federalism
and...
and
the
principle
of
comity,
state
courts
are
the
best
place
to
determine
the
application
of
state
tax
law.
comparing
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
california
in
this
case
presents
a
dramatic
example
of
why
this
should
be
the
result
in
this
case.
california
has
retained
as
part
of
its
sovereignty
the
ability
to
tax
its
own
citizens.
a
part
of
that
finality...
a
part
of
that
sovereignty
is
the
power
to
determine
the
finality
of
its
tax
payments.
that
is,
when
they
can
no
longer
be
refunded.
joint
appendix
page
21
shows
that
the
first
wbec
case
was
filed
on
february
18th,
1983.
and
here
we
are
more
than
10
years
later,
arguing
whether
the
united
states
has
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
courts.
in
contrast,
under
california
law
trial...
court...
cases
must
be
brought
to
trial
within
5
years
or
be
subject
to
mandatory
dismissal.
joint
appendix
page
95
shows
that
upon
instruction
of
the
united
states,
the
wbec...
e-c
cases
were
dismissed,
and
joint
appendix
pages
46
and
49
show
that
they
were
dismissed
within
1
month
of
the
running
of
the
5-year
statute,
the
california
5-year
statute.
united
states
interest,
on
the
other
hand,
is
simply
that
of
a
taxpayer.
there
are
no
issues
unique
to
the
united
states
in
this
case,
no
supremacy
clause
issues,
no
sovereign
immunity
issues,
no
discrimination
issues,
no
federal
constitutional
issues,
and
no
act
of
congress
is
involved.
a
federal
contractor
can
take
advantage
of
the
united
states
tax
immunity
because
it
derives
from
the
federal
contract.
the
reverse
also
must
be
true.
when
the
contractor
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
united
states
tax
immunity,
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
sue
the
state
for
a
tax
refund
derives
soley
from
the
federal
contract.
the
united
states
agreement
to
reimburse
wbec
in
this
case,
under
the
contract,
merely
provides
the
opportunity
for
the
united
states
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
taxpayer,
and
enabling
the
united
states
to
pursue
those
remedies
of
a
taxpayer.
indeed,
because
the
united
states
controlled
and
directed
these
actions,
it
shows
that
the
united
states
actually
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
the
actions
of
the
united
states
in
controlling
the
actions
and
the
willingness
of
wbec
to
submit
to
that
control
shows
that
they
view
their
relationship
as
one
of
subrogee
and
subrogor.
the
united
states
is
asking
this
court
to
do
two
things.
first,
to
disregard
the
available
state
remedies
in
asking
this
court
to
have
the
federal
courts
instruct
california
on
the
application
of
state
tax
law.
to
paraphrase
this
court
in
penhurst
state
high
school
or
hospital
versus
halderman,
it's
an
invasion
of
california
sovereignty
for
the
federal
courts
to
instruct
the
state
officials
on
the
application
of
state
tax
law.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
they
obligated
themselves
to...
to
pay--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
well,
the
only...
the
thing
that
i'm
relying
on
in
this...
in
this
case
is
the
sovereign
power
of
california
to
impose
taxes.
and
that
sovereignty,
i
think,
makes
it
different
from
the
example
you...
you
gave
me.
i'm
not
sure
there's
the
same
interest
of
california,
but--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--i
think
it's
different,
yeah.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
justice--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--well
if--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--now,
the
state's...
the
difference
between
sovereign
power
and
a
running
of
a
state
statute
of
limitation
is
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
dalm,
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
indicate
whether
or
not
there's
a
claim
against
the
sovereign.
and
the...
the
dalm
case
found
that
the...
both
a
timely
filing
of
a
federal
claim
for
refund
and
a
timely
filing
of
a
lawsuit
were
conditions
precedent
to
the
accrual
of
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
is
asking
the
court
to
invoke
equitable
remedies,
that
of
a
contract
implied
in
law
or
money
had
and
received,
and
declaratory
relief.
and
california's
position
is
that
this
court's
answer
should
be
consistent
with
the
long
line
of
authority,
from
dows
v.
city
of
chicago
in
1870
to
fair
assessment
in
real
estate
v.
mcnary
in
1981,
that
the
federal
government
cannot
invoke
equitable
remedies,
at
least
against
a
state
where
no
federal
issues
are
involved,
unless
the
effective
pursuit
of
remedies,
state
remedies,
is
pursued...
is
done.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
that's
our
position.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
dows
v.
city
of
chicago
in
1870.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
dows,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
don't
believe
i
cited
it
in
my
brief.
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
have
no
excuse.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
do
not
have
it
handy,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
i
do.
78
u.s.
108
1870.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
there
are
and
i'm
going
to...
i'm
going
to
discuss
those
in
a
few
seconds,
but
first
i
want
to
discuss
the
department
of
employment
case
which
deals
specifically
with
this
area.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
department
of
employment
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
mentioned
by
mr.
jones.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
the
department
of
employment
case
was
a
case
that
refused
to
apply
the
tax
injunction
act
as
to
state
taxes
because
a
federal
instrumentality
was
being
taxed
in
violation
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
that
rule
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
wbec
was
not
a
federal
instrumentality
and
there's
no
issue
of
sovereign
immunity.
indeed,
if
you
take
the
facts
of
the
department
of
employment
case
and
take
away
the
supremacy
clause
issue
in
that
case
and
substitute
in
its
place
the
principle
of
comity,
because
tax...
state
tax
law
was
involved,
it's
california's
position
that
even
federal
instrumentalities
must
be
required
to
pursue
state
remedies
before
seeking
relief
in
the
federal
courts.
there
are
three
cases
at
least,
and
maybe
more,
that...
i've
put
down...
i've
put
three
cases
that
the
united
states
has
cited
that
fall
into
this
category.
the
united
states
v.
benton,
united
states
v.
broward
county,
and
united
states
v.
dekalb
county
all
involve
issues
of
application
of
tax...
state
tax
law
only
and
there
are
no
supremacy
clause
issues.
and
california
believes
that
to
the
extent
that
these
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
state
remedies
need
not
be
pursued,
they
are
wrongly
decided.
these
are
all
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
so
california's
answer
to
the
question
presented
by
the
united
states
is
that
assuming
it
had...
just
assuming
for
purpose
of
argument
that
it
can
state
a
quasi-contract
cause
of
action,
when
the
issue
is
one
of
application
of
state
tax
law
only
and
there
are
no
supremacy
clause
issues,
pursuit...
effective
pursuit
of
state
remedies
is
required
before
the
access
to
federal
courts,
and
this
includes
meeting
all
the
procedural
requirements
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
well,
that
was
the
question
presented.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i'm
sorry,
i'm...
i
interrupted
you,
i
didn't--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--the
question
presented
is
that
the
united
states
assumes
it
has
a
quasi-contract
cause
of
action,
and
the
question
then
is
do
they
have
to
pursue
state
remedies.
and
our
answer
is
yes,
even
if
they
can
state
a
cause
of
action--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--i
don't
believe
it
precludes
subrogation
theory.
i
think
the
subrogation
theory
is
correct.
but
the
united
states,
in
presenting
the
question
to
the
court,
assumed
it
had
a
quasi-contract
cause
of
action.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
yes.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
well
it...
it...
it...
it
is.
we
think
it's
the
correct
answer,
but
the
problem
that,
of
course,
we've
had
with...
with
that--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--there's
no
court
that
has...
has
held
that.
and...
and
it's
a
new...
it's
an
issue
that
this
court's
never...
never
reached.
and
so
to
rely
solely
on
that.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
it
doesn't.
it
just
causes
me
to...
to...
to
be
careful
and
not
putting
all
my
eggs
in
one
basket
just
in
case
it...
this
court
doesn't
agree
with
me.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--i
have
no
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
don't
accept
them
as
having
a...
a
contract...
a
quasi-contract
cause
of
action.
but
they
may
be
in
point
if
they
do
have
a
contract,
quasi-contract
cause
of
action.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
the
only
basis
that...
that
i've
been
able
to
distinguish
the
common
law
quasi-contract
action
is
that
the
money
was
supposed
to
be
paid
involuntarily.
and
although
wbec
may
be
said
to...
to
pay...
have
paid
the
taxes
involuntarily,
i
don't
think
that
could
be
said
of
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
is
the
one
asserting
this
action.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
so
i'm
not
sure
they
meet
the
common
law
definition.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
all
the
other
cases...
all
the
cases,
besides
the
three
i
mentioned,
relied
upon
by
the
united
states
involve
supremacy
clause
issues.
and
in
that
sense...
and
that
situation
is
the
only
time
that
the
courts
allow
the
united
states
to
go
directly
to
the
federal
court.
those
issues
are
not
present
in
this
case.
the
clearfield
trust
case
also
would
not
apply.
the
clearfield
trust
was
a
response
to
this
court's
decisions
in
erie
v.
tompkins
and
hinterleiter
v.
laplada.
those
two
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
federal
courts
can
invoke
federal
common
law
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
however,
the
application
of
that
rule
has
some
conditions
precedent
which
aren't
present...
which
have
not
been
discussed.
one
is
that
this
court
has
held
that
when
the
united
states
and
a
state
are
the
parties,
then
the
interests
of
both
governments
must
be
considered.
and
when
you
consider
the
interests
of
state
government,
the
principle
of
comity
also
comes
into
play.
that
was
the
board
of
commissioners
v.
the
united
states,
308
u.s.
343,
1939.
also,
this
court
has
stated
that
the
invoking
of
federal
common
law
is
usually
applied
in
situations
where
a
federal
rule
is
necessary
to
protect
uniquely
federal
interests.
there's
no
uniquely
federal
interest
in
this
case
that
needs
protection.
third,
in
determining
whether
to
apply
common
law,
this
court
has
held
that
a
guiding
principle
is
a
significant
conflict
between
the
use
of
state
law
and
federal
interest
or
policy.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
conflict.
the
united
states
does
not
have
a
quasi-contract
cause
of
action,
although
up
to
this
point
i've
been
assuming
it
had,
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
there
has
been
no
unjust
enrichment
of
california
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
quasi-contract
action.
how
can
california
be
unjustly
enriched
when
wbe...
state
court
actions
could
have
resolved
every
state
law
issue
in
this
case,
including
whether
taxes
were
overpaid.
california
cannot
be
unjustly
riched...
enriched
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
when
the
united
states
directed
and
controlled
the
state
court
actions
and
failed
to
bring
the
suits
to
trial
within
5
years
and
directed
wbec
to
dismiss
the
actions.
the
second
reason
that
the
united
states
has
no
quasi-contract
cause
of
action
in
this
case
is
that
the
united
states
as
a
subrogee
can
invoke
only
those
remedies
of
wbec,
and
wbec
did
not
have
a
remedy
of
a
quasi-contract
action
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
if...
if
the
united
states
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the...
of
the
contractor
it
becomes...
it
becomes
a
real
party
in
interest.
i
think
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
one
whose
money
is
at
stake,
and
i
don't
believe
that
being
a
subrogee
has
any
conflict
with
that
concept
at
all.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
that's
the
reason
it
is
the
real
party
in
interest.
mr.
robert
d.
milam
but
that...
i
don't
think
that
conflicts
with
being
a
subrogee.
the
united
states'
claim
in
this
case
is
based
entirely
upon
california
tax
law.
and
like
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
dalm,
the
united
states...
the
california
tax
law
requires
the
filing
of
a
claim
for
refund
and
the
filing
of
a
suit
within
90
days
of
the
notice
of
denial
of
the
claim
for
refund.
wbec
did
go
through
this
procedure.
notice
of
denials
were
made
and
it
filed
suit
within
90
days.
however,
because
it's
a
part
of
the
california
accrual
of
a
cause
of
action
under
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
once
the
dismissals
were
made
wbec's
actions...
claim
against
the
state
of
california
were
extinguished
by
operation
of
law
when
the
dismissals
were
made.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
a
dismissal
means
those
cases
were
never
filed,
and
if
the
wbec
cases
were
never
filed
no
case
was
filed
within
the
90
days
of
the
notice
of
denial
of
wbec's
claim
for
refund.
so
the
united
states
can
make
no
claim
against
california
either
as
a
taxpayer,
because
it
did
not
file
a
claim
for
refund,
or
as
a
subrogee
of
wbec.
and
it's
reliance
upon
summerlin--
mr.
robert
d.
milam
--i
don't...
in
this
case
i
don't
believe
so
because
wbec
had
no
such
action
and
a
subrogee
just
takes
the
remedies
of
the
subrogor.
so
the
united
states
reliance
on
the
summerlin
case
is
misplaced
because
it
fails
to
distinguish
between
a
statute...
state
statute
of
limitations
depriving
the
united
states
of
a
preexisting
valid
claim
and
the
conditions
precedent
to
an
accrual
of
a
cause
of
action
under
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
first
question
for
summerlin
and
summerlin
analysis
is
is
there
a
valid
cause
of
action.
if
there's
no
valid
cause
of
action,
then
you
never
get
to
the
second
element
of
summerlin,
the
deprival...
depriving
of
the
united
states
of
a
cause
of...
of
a
claim.
even
if
you
assume
that
during
the
pendency
of
the
state
court
actions
that
wbec
filed
the
united
states
had
a
valid
claim,
that
claim
was
not
denied
by
statute
of
limitations,
that
claim
was
denied
by
the
voluntary
dismissal
of
those
cases
under
direction
of
the
united
states.
i
have
nothing
further.
