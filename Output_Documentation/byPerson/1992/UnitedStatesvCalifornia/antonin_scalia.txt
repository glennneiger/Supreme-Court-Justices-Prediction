justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
businesses
do
that
all
the
time.
i
mean
they
have
less
money
than
the
united
states.
i
don't
understand
why
that
is
such
a
big
imposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
united
states
is...
is
claiming
exemptions,
or
whatever,
under
state
laws,
to
follow
those
procedures.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
assuming
this
is
federal
property
at
issue,
do
you
know
of
any
other
instances
where
in
order
to
hold
on
to
its
own
property
the
federal
government
has
to
appear
in
state
proceedings?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
of
course,
even
if
you
admitted
in
that
case,
as
i
suspect
might
be
the
case,
the
united
states
could
sue
in
federal
court,
that's
not
the
issue
here.
it's
just
whether
the
state
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
to
that
suit,
isn't
that...
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
just
arguing
about
what
statute
of
limitations
applies.
that's...
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
your
response
to
justice
stevens
were
yes,
the
united
states
would...
could
proceed
in
federal
court
against
the...
against
the
lawyer,
you...
you
still
might
be--
--even
if...
even
if
the
statute
of
limitation
is
run,
is
my
question.
even
if
the
state
statute's
run.
even
if
it's
run,
i
see.
that's
why.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
don't
understand.
i
mean
i
can
understand
the
other
basis
for
the
result
you
want,
namely
the
basis
that...
where
the
united
states
is
just
subrogated
to
a...
to
a
claim
of
someone
else.
if
that
someone
else
has
no
right
to
ignore
the
state
procedures,
neither
does
the
united
states;
that
makes
sense
to
me.
but
you're...
this
theory
you're
giving
us
now
that
even
if
it
were
the
united
states
in
its
own
right
that
were
suing,
it
would
have
to
follow
the
state
procedure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
seems,
that's
a
lot
harder
to
swallow.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
was
the
question
presented?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
quasi-contract
cause
of
action
precludes
any
subrogation
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
i
have
to
assume
that
this
case
is
the
same
as
though
the
united
states
were
suing
in
its
own
right,
as
though
the
tax
had
been
posed
on
the
united
states
and
not
on
its
contractor?
well,
haven't
you
already
answered
that,
yes,
by
saying
that
the
united
states
could
have
not
only
intervened
but
might...
should
have
been
required
to
intervene
because
it's
the
real
party
in
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-hum.
well.
who's...
you
may
agree
with
the
subrogation
theory
but
that
isn't
really
the
main
thrust
of
your
argument
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
can
you
bring
a
suit
for
money
had
and
received
as
subrogee?
i
mean
the
question
we'd
accepted
is
whether
invoking...
in
invoking
the
federal
cause
of
action
for
money
had
and
received,
the
united
states
must
comply
with
the
state
law
requirements.
can
you
do
that
when
you're
a
subrogee?
