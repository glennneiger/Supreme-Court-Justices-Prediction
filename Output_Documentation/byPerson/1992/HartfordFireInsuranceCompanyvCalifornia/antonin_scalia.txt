justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
it
isn't
enough
to
be
within
the
business
of
insurance.
you
have
to
be
within
the
business
of
insurance
regulated
by
the
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
certainly
not
conceded
that
the
foreign
insurers,
or
the
reinsurers
generally,
are
within
the
business
of
insurance
regulated
by
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
whether
your
client
is
regulated,
it's
whether
the
business
of
reinsurance
is
regulated,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
can't
play
the
game
both
ways.
you're
either
talking
about
the
business
of
insurance
or
you're
talking
about
individuals,
and
we're
talking
about
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
the
question
is
whether
the
business
of
reinsurance
is,
number
1,
part
of
the
business
of
insurance,
which
i
assume
it
is,
and
number
2,
regulated
by
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
forms-developmentprocess
cannot
compel
a
reinsurer
to
reinsure
something
that
he
doesn't
want
to
reinsure
or
that
he's
agreed
with
others
not
to
reinsure,
can
it?
the
form
process
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
in
fact,
as
i
understand
it,
all
the
states
except
one
permit
the
first
kind
of
insurance
that's
been
eliminated...
event
occurrence
insurance.
all
states
but
one
permit
it,
but
it's
not
offered
by
anybody,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
general
law,
not
peculiarly
insurance
regulation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
these
laws
do
not
cover
the
foreign
reinsurers.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
that
you
ought
to
concede
it's
a
boycott.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
shapiro,
i
can
understand
why
an
insurance
company
has
an
interest
in
getting
the
reinsurer
to
agree
that
he
will
insure
this
kind
of
insurance
and
will
insure
this
kind
of
a
form.
i
do
not
know
why...
explain
to
me
why
it's
important
to
the
insurer
to
know
that
the
reinsurer
will
not
insure
another
kind
of
risk,
or
will
not
accept
another
kind
of
form.
why
is
that
necessary?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see...
i
see.
i
see.
i
gotcha.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
i
assume
that
the
reason
the
contention
was
not
even
made
that
the
united
states
insurers
coerced
the
reinsurers
to
not
handling
certain
types
of
coverage
is
that
on
its
face
it
would
be
laughable.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if
you
can't
go
to
lloyd's...
you're
going
to
boycott
lloyd's
of
london
for
reinsurance.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
not
be
able
to
reinsure
anywhere.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
coercion
would
go
in
the
other
direction,
if
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
i've
confused
some
of
the
positions
here.
does
the
justice
department
concede
that
the
reinsurers
alone
could
agree
on
all
of
these
things
and
agree
not
to
write
certain
kinds
of
coverage?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
think
the
justice
department
might
well
say
that
the
reinsurers
are
in
the
business
of
insurance
but
they're
not
regulated
by
the
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
therefore
can't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
not
a
boycott,
but
i
understood
that
they
would
say
that's
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
boast,
i
assume
just
sort
of
by
the
way
that
if
you
contend
that
these
foreign
reinsurers
are
not
subject
to
the
sherman
act,
i
assume
you
also
contend
that
they
are
not
subject
to
state
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
lauritzen
was
what,
jones
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
jones
act,
but
the
holding
was
the
jones
act
didn't
apply,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
contending
that
the
sherman
act
doesn't
apply
abroad.
i...
it
seems
to
me
it's
one
thing
to
say,
having
considered
all
the
pros
and
cons,
this
legislation
does
not
apply
abroad.
it's
another
thing
to
say
well,
it
does
apply
sometimes,
and
it
doesn't
apply
other
times.
i
don't
know
how
i
can
do
that
with
the
sherman
act.
it
either
applies
or
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction,
or
maybe
it's
just
not
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade?
that
is
to
say,
it
becomes
a
reasonable
restraint.
i
mean,
we've
always
had
a
lot
of
room
not
to
fiddle
around
with
our
jurisdiction
but
to
fiddle
around
with
what
constitutes
a
restraint
of
trade
under
the
sherman
act.
it's
essentially
a
common
law
antitrust
that
we've
developed
ourselves.
why
couldn't
we
say
that,
that
the
sherman
act
applies
fully,
and
we
have
full
jurisdiction,
however,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
given
that
these
people
are
acting
in
england
and
subject
to
english
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
may
be
more
comfortable
with
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
why
is
it
exclusively
in
britain?
wasn't
there
asserted
to
be
any
connection
between
the
conspiracy
with
the
foreign
reinsurers
and
the
domestic
reinsurers?
wasn't
it
part
of
one
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
perfectly
okay
for
the
insurers
to
agree
among
themselves
that
no
matter
how
many
consumers
might
want
a
particular
coverage,
it
will
not
be
offered,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
consumer
is
left
at
the
mercies
of
insurers
plus
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regulation
to
that
extent,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
is
thought,
i
suppose,
that
if
they
can't
make
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
the
company
coming
in
with
the
more
attractive
coverage
may
be
a
fly-by-night
company
and
they
will
all
be
tempted
into
insolvency,
right?
that's
probably
the
theory
behind
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
that's
a
problem...
i
mean,
if
that's
a
problem
downstream,
why
isn't
that
a
problem
upstream?
are
you
any
better
off
with
an
insurance
industry
that
goes
bust
at
the
reinsurance
level
than
at
one
that
goes...
than
you
are
with
one
that
goes
bust
at
the
insurance...
i
mean,
that...
the
whole
scheme
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
much
sense
unless
the
insurance
companies
have
the
ability
to
ensure
solvency
at
the
reinsurance
level
just
as
well
as
at
the
insurance
level.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
could
understand
it
if
the
primaries
are
coercing
the
reinsurers,
but
there's
no
allegation
of
their
coercing
the
reinsurers.
they're
just
trying
to
persuade
the
reinsurers,
look,
you
fellas,
if
you
insure
this
kind
of
coverage,
you
are
going
to
get
burned
so
badly
you're
going
to
go
down
and
we're
going
to
go
down
with
you.
now,
why
is
that
an
evil
kind
of
a
boycott
that
we
should
say
the
government
comes
down
on,
given
the
scheme...
given
the
scheme?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
pressure
was
applied
here?
pressuring
others
to
withhold...
what
pressure
was
applied
against,
in
particular,
lloyd's?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
all.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be.
would
it
have
been
unlawful
for
the
american
insurers
just
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
reinsurers
the
fact
that
in
their
view
it
would
be
financially
disastrous
to
continue
to
reinsure
this
kind
of
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
agreement?
you
and
i
agree
that
you
will
not
do
something.
is
that
an
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
that's
an
agreement.
that's
just
the
reinsurer
telling
the
insurer,
you're
right,
it's
a
good
idea,
i
will
not
insure
these...
it's
not
an
agreement.
one
side
has
to
do
something,
the
other
side
does
something
else.
what's
the
insurer's
remedy
for
breach,
if
the
reinsurer
breaks
the
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
someone
had
to
talk
them
into
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
somebody
coming
in
and
telling
them,
look,
you're
going
to
get
into
real
trouble
in
the
american
market,
and
they
say,
my
god,
you're
right,
we
better
do
that,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
they
were
saying
to
one
another,
look,
if
there's
any
real
problem
in
the
american
market,
certainly
the
american
insurers
will
let
us
know.
i
mean,
basically
these
are
sophisticated
companies,
and
if
there's
some
kind
of
coverage
that
we
shouldn't
be
handling,
they'll
come
and
tell
us,
and
sure
enough,
that's
what
happened.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there
are
some
risk-averse
people
and
some
nonrisk-averse
people,
and
the
whole
theory
of
insurance
regulation
is
that
nonrisk-averse
people
shouldn't
be
running
insurance
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do
that,
mr.
price--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you've
talked
about
the
boycott
issue.
i
don't
think
you've
talked
about
the...
maybe
the
prior
issue
of
whether
these
are
even
the
business
of
insurance
regulated
by
state
law.
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
foreign.
what
about
the
domestic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
domestic
reinsurers?
do
you
concede
that
they
are
regulated
by
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
not
as
reinsurers.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
raises
an
interesting
question,
though.
is
it
the
reinsurance
you
should
look
to,
or
the
insurance?
the
alleged
object
of
the
conspiracy,
the
alleged
object
of
it,
is
not
to
fix
reinsurance.
the
vice
is
fixing
insurance,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
means,
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
since
the
object
is
to
fix
insurance,
shouldn't
the
proper
question
be
whether
that
is
regulated
by
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
have
you?
couldn't
the
regulators
require
insurance
companies
to
offer
particular
types
of
coverage?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
lloyd's
is
going
to
kiss
goodbye
to
half
of
all
of
its
reinsurance
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
foreign
reinsurers
are
subject
to
the
sherman
act
and
i
guess
would
be
liable
as
a
contract
combination
or
conspiracy
even
if
the
american
insurers
had
not
been
part
of
the
scheme,
right?
i
mean,
it's
contrary
to
the
sherman
act
for
all
of
these
reinsurers
to
agree
upon
the
terms
of
reinsurance,
whether
at
the
instance
of
american
insurers
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
would
think
so.
