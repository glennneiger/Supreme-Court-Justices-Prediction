mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
looking
into
this
case
as
amicus
curiae,
what
we
view
as
most
significant
in
these
complaints
are
allegations
that
the
collaborators
agreed
upon
an
enforcement
mechanism,
namely
the
cutting
off
of
reinsurance,
to
ensure
compliance
with
a
privately
imposed
trade
restraint
restricting
the
kinds
of
commercial
liability
insurance
that
would
be
available,
and
in
the
questioning,
members
of
the
court
have
put
their
finger
on
the
relevant
allegations
in
the
complaints.
they're
on
pages
24
and
25
of
the
joint
appendix,
particularly
paragraphs
64
through
69,
which
shows
that
the
enforcement
mechanism
of
cutting
off
the
availability
of
reinsurance
was
allegedly
imposed
at
the
behest
of
the
primaries,
hartford
and
its
allies,
which
were
seeking
to
restrict
the
kind
of
coverage
being
offered
by
their
competitors.
now,
enforcement
mechanisms
pose
special
dangers
to
competition
and
to
consumer
interests,
and
this
is
because,
in
general,
the
greater
the
consumer
need
or
desire
for
particular
products
or
services
that
the
trade
restraint
withholds,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
the
restraint
will
tend
to
break
down
through
a
sort
of
centrifugal
force
as
individual
firms
respond
to
the
resulting
competitive
opportunity
posed
by
these
unmet
consumer
needs,
and
enforcement
mechanisms
as
part
of
the
conspiracy
really
presuppose
this
and
are
designed
to
apply
countervailing
pressure
to
preserve
the
effectiveness
of
the
restraint
against
this
centrifugal
force,
if
you
will.
and
here
the
allegations
go
beyond
the
normal
hypothesis
that
members
of
the
agreement
must
be
restrained
from
the
temptation
to
break
out,
and
charge
that
the
enforcement
mechanism
was
applied
not
only
to
the
conspirators
themselves,
but
also
to
force
capitulation
by
firms
that
were
not
parties
to
the
agreement
that
had
resisted
hartford's
effort
to
get
the
iso
to
limit
the
forms
in
the
same
way
and,
therefore,
fairly
reading
the
complaint,
that
continued
to
desire
to
offer
the
kinds
of
coverage
that
the
restraint
was
designed
to
eliminate.
now,
that,
to
us,
is
conduct
at
the
core
of
the
exception
from
mccarran-ferguson
act
immunity
that
congress
took
special
care
to
specify
by
expressly
withholding
immunity
from
any
act
of
boycott,
coercion,
or
intimidation,
or
agreement
to
boycott,
coerce
or
intimidate.
this
is
language,
as
this
court
recognized
in
barry,
that
was
picked
up
by
congress
from
this
court's
opinion
in
south-eastern
underwriters.
it
was
the
part
of
the
holding
of
south-eastern
underwriters
that
congress
concluded
it
should
preserve
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
and
our
principal
authority
for
stating
that
it's
conduct
at
the
core
of
the
exception
is
the
way
this
court,
both
in
the
majority
opinion
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
st.
paul
insurance
v.
barry,
construed
the
exception
for
boycott
coercion
or
intimidation.
it
is
the
one
case
that
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
address
that
exception
and
construe
it
in
some
detail.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
they
are...
if
they
are
regulated
by
the
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
extent
regulated
by
the
states,
the
business
of
insurance
is
given
antitrust
immunity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
may
be
something
of
that,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well
it's
quite
possible
that
the
reinsurers
will
be
the
primary
protectors
of
what
is
needed
for
assuring
solvency
at
the
reinsurance
level
and
that
the
motives
of
the
primaries
could
be
mixed
at
best
in
entering
into
that
endeavor,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
question
that
you're
posing,
mr.
justice,
suggests
a
possible
way
of
defending
a
boycott
as
one
which
under
the
standards
of
northwest
stationers
is
not
one
to
which
a
per
se
condemnation
should
be
applied,
and
is
one
that
is
justified
under
the
circumstances
under
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
if
that
hypothesis
can
be
substantiated
by
proof
in
the
particular
case.
but
the
same
claim
could
be
made
in
a
case
where
the
primaries
are
simply
trying
to
gain
a
competitive
advantage
and
follow
more
lucrative
practices
and
prevent
their
competitors
from
competing
on
terms
that
some
of
their
customers
might
prefer,
so
that
the
claim
is
not
one
that
on
its
face
would
justify
a
boycott
as
permissible
under
the
sherman
act
or
prevent
the
conduct
from
being
boycott,
coercion,
or
intimidation
within
the
meaning
of
the
exception
to
mccarran-ferguson.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
certainly
they...
the
answer
gets
a
little
complicated,
if
you'll
permit
me,
mr.
justice.
certainly
they
could
agree
among
themselves
as
to
what
they
will
offer,
and
that
would
not
be
a
boycott,
even
though
there
may
be
a
question
of
whether
there
is
implied
in
that
an
agreement
that
there's
something
they
will
not
offer.
at
the
other
extreme,
if
they
include
an
enforcement
mechanism
so
that
one
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
who
breaks
ranks
and
decides
to
go
ahead
and
offer
that
reinsurance
will
be
penalized
by
the
other
coconspirators,
that
would,
in
our
view,
be
a
boycott,
but
the
simple
case
that
you
put
arguably
would
not,
although
it's
very
similar
to
what
happened
in
the
barry
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
is
called
a
boycott
by
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
definitely
say
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
the
enforcement
mechanism
that
has
made
this
a
boycott,
and
in
this
case
it's
because
you've
got
participants
at
the
primary
level
and
there
is
an
enforcement
mechanism
against
their
competitors
to
prevent
their
competitors
from
offering
certain
products.
you
don't
really
have
that
kind
of
disciplining
of
anyone
when
only
the
reinsurers
are
involved,
but
when
you've
got
the
two-level
conspiracy
with
an
enforcement
mechanism
against
competitors
at
one
of
the
levels,
you've
converted
just
a
refusal
to
do
business
on
terms
that
are
unacceptable
to
the
reinsurers
into
an
enforcement
mechanism
that
coerces
competitors
of
some
of
the
collaborators
into
not
being
able
to
compete
in
ways
that
they
want
to
compete.
now,
since
my
time
is
running
short,
i
think
i
should
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
comity
issue,
which
is
raised
with
respect
to
some
other
counts
here.
the
principal
of
comity
was
recognized,
even
if
in
a
rather
rudimentary
way,
when
the
sherman
act
was
enacted,
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act
of
1982
suggests
that
congress
thought
comity
principals
could
be
employed
in
antitrust
litigation
in
accordance
with
decisions
such
as
the
ninth
circuit's
timberlane
case.
we
agree
with
that
if
comity
is
properly
conceived
and
properly
cabined.
the
important
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
comity
is
not
an
invitation
to
other
nations
to
decide
which
of
our
laws
they
like
or
dislike
and
thereby
to
determine
whether
their
nationals
need
or
need
not
comply
with
particular
laws
when
they're
nationals
are
engaged
in
commerce
in
this
country.
it's
not
a
device
for
ceding
to
other
nations
the
making
of
legal
policy
for
engaging
in
commerce
here,
but
instead
comity
analysis
should
apply
objective
criteria
which
have
been
formulated
in
multifactor
tests
that
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief.
here,
the
ninth
circuit
applied
its
own
test
in
timberlane,
which
has
been
a
leading
decision
on
the
subject,
and
we
think
it
reached
the
correct
result
in
applying
the
test
and,
if
anything,
was
too
generous
to
the
claim
of
comity
in
holding
that
there
was
a
conflict
at
all.
we
have
to
remember
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
allegedly
directed
entirely
at
the
u.s.
market,
where
the
respondent
states
claim
that
lloyd's
does
at
least
50
percent
of
its
reinsurance
business,
and
the
effects
to
be
felt
in
the
u.s.
market
were
very
substantial
and
foreseeable.
they
have
been
interestingly
documented
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
support
of
the
states
filed
by
the
service
industry
counsel,
to
which
i
would
refer
the
court,
and
there
we
think
that
the
jurisdiction
was
properly
exercised
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
