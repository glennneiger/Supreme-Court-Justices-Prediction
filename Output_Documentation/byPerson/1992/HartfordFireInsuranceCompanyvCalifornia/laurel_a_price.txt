mr.

a.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
group
of
insurers
enlist
third
parties
to
refuse
to
continue
to
supply
their
competitors
in
order
to
enforce
upon
them
changes
in
their
competitive
behavior,
this
court
has
always
found
that
that
described
a
boycott
within
the
meaning
of
the
sherman
act.
in
these
cases
in
particular,
four
primary
insurance
companies
decided
that
they
no
longer
wanted
to
write
particular
coverages,
but
they
also
knew
that
they
couldn't
simply
walk
away
from
those
coverages
because
if
their
competitors
continued
to
write
them,
they
would
lose
significant
share
of
the
market
that
they
currently
possessed.
in
order
to
forestall
that
eventuality,
they
went
to
reinsurers,
and
they
went
to
reinsurers
precisely
because
reinsurance
is
one
of
the
things
that
an
insurer
needs
in
order
to
be
able
to
effectively
write
coverage,
reinsurance
was
at
the
particular
time
at
issue
in
these
cases
in
short
supply,
and
reinsurance
is
not
effectively
regulated
by
the
states.
thus,
it
was
the
specific
and
best
means
immediately
available
by
which
they
could
compel
their
competitors
to
also
cease
writing
this
coverage,
and
that
is
precisely
the
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
boycott
that
this
court
found
in
barry.
indeed,
when
this
court
offered
what
described
as
the
generic
definition
of
a
boycott,
it
said
it
was
a
method
of
pressure
by
withholding
or
enlisting
others
to
withhold
patronage
or
services
from
the
target,
and
the
purpose
of
that
withholding--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
pressure
was
applied
against
lloyd's--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--your
honor
is
raising
the
difficult
question
of
whether
an
agreement
or
a
conspiracy
was
formed.
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
specifically
allege
an
agreement
which
in
a
procedural
posture
have
to
be
taken
as
true,
but
if
there
was
no
agreement--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--the
agreement
was
that
i,
as
an
insurer,
agree
with
you,
as
a
reinsurer--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--that
you
will
not
offer
reinsurance
for
particular
coverages
which
i
do
not
want
my
competitors
to
offer
in
the
market
in
competition
against
me.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
he
would
then...
presumably
he'd
be
left
in
the
position
of
cutting
off
reinsurance
to--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--the
question
your
honor
is
raising,
as
is
justice
scalia,
is
the
question
of
what
was
the
motivation
of
the
reinsurer
to
enter
into
this
agreement?
mr.
laurel
a.
price
that's
correct.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
the
agreement
at
issue
was
an
agreement
that
they
were
seeking
to
enlist
the
aid
of
the
reinsurers
in
compelling
changes
in
american
reinsurance
markets.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
what
the--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--yes.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
the
insurers
agreed
amongst
themselves
not
to
offer
claims-made
coverage,
and
they
also
agreed
to
attempt
to
keep
other
people
from
using
those
forms
and
offering
that
coverage
as
well.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
they
went
to
the
reinsurers
to
obtain
the
coercive
enforcement
mechanism
which
they
themselves
didn't
possess
over
their
competitors.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
yes,
and
that
the
reinsurers
agreed
to
provide
that
muscle.
that's
precisely--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--the
agreement.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
in
exchange,
they
would
have
an
american
market
which
possessed
them
with
less
risk
and
potentially
more
profit,
so
that
the
mere
fact--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--that
it
is
mutually
advantageous--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--yes,
your
honor,
somebody
had
to--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--and
they
hadn't
done
it
previously
on
their
own
and,
indeed,
there
are
matters
which
are
outside
this
record
which
would
show
that
they
had
previously
been
asked
whether
they
thought
changes
needed
to
be
made
in
the
1973
forms
and
they
had
said
that
that
worked.
so
now
why,
a
few
years
later,
do
they
all
of
a
sudden
change
and
say
the
sky
is
falling?
mr.
laurel
a.
price
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
further
part
of
the
problem.
assuming
that
the
predicate
is
correct
that
there
is
a
"problem
in
the
american
industry",
and
that
problem,
the
way
it
has
been
posited,
is
that
it's
unprofitable
to
write
this
kind
of
coverage
both
at
the
insurer
and
reinsurance
level,
and
if
that's
true,
then
it
is
in
the
economic
self-interest
of
everyone
in
the
industry
to
abandon
that
coverage,
and
if
i
and
my
immediate
competitors,
the
four
primary
defendants
in
this
case,
agree
that
it's
in
our
interest
to
stop
writing
this
coverage,
we
agree
it
is
in
our
interest
to
get
reinsurance
for
this
less
coverage,
why
would
they
care
whether
their
competitors
continued
to
write
this
unprofitable
coverage
which
might
bankrupt
them
and
leave
them
a
bigger
market
to
control
for
themselves?
mr.
laurel
a.
price
but
reinsurers
are
smart
people,
too.
they
know
how
to
identify
a
risk-averse
and
a
risk-careful
person.
they
know
which
people
they
should
or
shouldn't
insure
risks
for.
why
do
they
need
a
uniform
rule
in
a
market
which
generally
does
not
admit
to
such
uniform
rules?
normally,
when
you
contract
for
reinsurance,
you
as
an
insurer
go
to
london.
you
get
a
broker.
he
goes
around
and
assembles
a
ad
hoc
joint
venture,
if
you
will,
who'll
subscribe
to
a
reinsurance
treaty
to
reinsure
my
book
of
business,
and
their
willingness
to
reinsure
my
book
of
business
in
no
way
depends
on
their
refusing
to
reinsure
any
other
insurer's
book
of
business,
and
i
don't
see
why
that
agreement
follows
from
the
fact
that
there
might
be
some
plausible
efficiency
in
the
arrangements
which
you
posit,
and
if
there
were
those
efficiencies
you
wouldn't
need
these
kind
of
coercive
means
to
compel
the
market
to
reach
that
rational
conclusion
and,
indeed,
the
state
regulators,
who
also
have
those
same
interests,
didn't
go
out
and
compel
the
industry
to
avoid
these
coverages
as
well.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
the
kind
of
cooperation
that
the
exemption
posits
as
beneficial
for
the
industry
is
voluntary
cooperation.
it's
cooperation
based
on
mutually
perceived
joint
needs.
it
is
not
cooperation
induced
with
the
heavy
club
of
coercion.
indeed,
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
regulation
and
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
while
the
statute
may
permit
the
states
to
allow
insurers
to
cooperate
in
a
variety
of
efficiency-enhancing
means,
it
expressly
prohibits
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.
it
was
the
fears
in
congress
born
of
the
experience
in
the
south-east
underwriters
case
that
insurers,
because
they
needed
certain
levels
of
cooperation
to
efficiently
function,
were
in
a
position
of
danger,
that
they
had
a
power
through
cooperation
which
could
be
abused,
and
the
way
you
abuse
it
is
precisely
the
way
it
was
abused
in
south-eastern
underwriters.
you
withhold
from
competitors
who
won't
conform
their
behavior
to
your
private
standards,
reinsurance,
which
is
a
necessary
incidence
needed,
and
you
withhold
from
them
further
the
services
of
rating
organizations
such
as
the
iso
defendant
in
this
case,
which
are
also
necessary,
and
those
are
the
precise
means
utilized
to
enforce
the
agreements
which
we
allege
in
the
complaints
in
this
case.
turning
to
the
definition
of
the
phrase,
"boycott",
one
must
start
with
looking
at
the
statute
and
what
the
statute
itself
says.
the
statute
simply
uses
the
phrase,
"any
act
or
agreement
of
boycott,
coercion,
and
intimidation.
"
it
does
not
offer
any
adjectives
such
as
"total",
"partial",
or
"discriminatory".
it
derives
those
terms
expressly
from
the
sherman
act
cases
itself.
indeed,
it
comes
directly
from
this
court's
language
in
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case,
and
more
specifically
it
was
the
congressional
purpose
to
preclude
the
kind
of
private
regulatory
activity
that
we
see
in
this
case.
in
the
barry
case,
this
court
defined
"boycott"
with
reference
to
the
sherman
act
cases,
and
it
did
so
because
it
found
that
the
sherman
act
language
had
been
utilized
by
the
congress
and
that
the
particular
purpose
the
congress
had
wished
to
serve
derives
specifically
from
this
court's
decision
in
south-eastern
underwriters.
further,
the
petitioners
cite
no
case
law
whatsoever
which
is
contrary
to
this
definition
of
"boycott"
focusing
on
the
use
of
coercive
means.
when
one
looks
at
the
distinction
of
"partial"
and
"absolute",
one
cannot
find
that
as
a
consistent
thread
through
this
court's
antitrust
boycott
jurisprudence.
indeed,
the
only
common
thread
which
ties
those
cases
together,
if
at
all,
is
the
notion
of
coercive
enforcement
activity.
this
court
specifically
noted
in
barry
both
that
boycotts
were
not
a
unitary
phenomenon
and
that
the
case
law
showed
a
marked
lack
of
uniformity,
and
it
is
not
a
unitary
phenomenon,
and
it
shows
that
marked
lack
of
uniformity
precisely
because
what
is
a
boycott
is
circumstantial
to
a
significant
extent.
what
is
coercive
and
effective
against
one
party
in
one
market
circumstance
might
not
be
as
effective
against
another
party
in
a
different
circumstance.
when
you
look
at
that
definition
in
relationship
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
is
precisely
what
we've
pled
here...
an
agreement
by
a
small
group
of
insurers
seeking
to
preclude
their
competitors
from
offering
coverages
against
which
they
did
not
wish
to
compete.
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
the
comity
portion
of
the
decision.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
yes,
sir.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
our
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
correct
in
holding
that
the
re...
the
foreign
reinsurers
specifically--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--were
not
regulated.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
we
do
not
concede
that
their
reinsurance
business
is
regulated
by
state
law
in
the
way
that
is
required
by
the
mccarran
act,
and
there's
a
distinction
there
that
is
important
to
understand.
they
are...
the
domestic
reinsurers
are
all
licensed
insurers
under
the
law
of
each
state,
and
the
state
has
a
variety
of
regulations
that
applies
to
their
business
activities
as
insurers.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
but
specifically
regulation
of
what
kind
of
reinsurance
contracts
they
offer,
to
whom
they
offer
them,
at
what
premium
rates
and
under
what
terms
and
conditions,
those
simply
are
not
regulated.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
reinsurance
is
the
means
utilized--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--to
compel
that
end.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
no,
because--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--the
reason
not
is,
where
you
use
an
unregulated
means
to
change
conditions
in
a
regulated
market,
you
have
taken
it
beyond
the
power
of
the
regulator
to
put--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--the
case
back
to
the
status
quo
ante.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
and
they
could
make
the
situation
worse
in
that
circumstance.
if
the
reinsurers
have
decided,
pursuant
to
the
agreement,
not
to
offer
reinsurance,
and
if
insurers
need
reinsurance
in
order
to
offer
that
coverage,
then
a
regulator
saying,
offer
that
coverage,
would
put
the
insurers
in
the
position
of
very
quickly
using
up
all
their
available
capacity
to
write
this
one
narrow
line
of
coverage,
and
would
put
them
in
a
position
where
the
total
amount
of
coverage
they
could
write
was
substantially
less.
so
yes,
they
could
order
it,
and
the
net
effect
might
well
be
an
absolute
constriction
of
the
total
output
in
the
market
because
of
the
inability
to
access
the
reinsurance
market.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
one
doesn't
know
what
they
might
do
in
the
short
run
if
they
thought
they
could
get
a
long-term
benefit
of
restructuring
a
market
in
a
way
they
liked
better
than
what
they
currently
saw,
and
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
punishes
those
short-term
kind
of
expedients
to
gain
long-term
advantages.
so
the
mere
fact
that
you
can't
find
an
absolute
and
totally
consistent
motivation
for
them
independent
of
the
primary
insurers
isn't
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
they
had
a
shared,
unlawful
interest
which
they
concluded
by
prohibited
means
and
which
the
sherman
act
would
remedy.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
if
their
sole...
in
other
words,
if
there
were
simply
an
agreement
on
terms
of
coverage
for
the
purpose
of
continued
solvency.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
in
that
circumstance
it
would
not
be
a
boycott
because
you
don't
have
any
additional
activity
designed
to
enforce
that
agreement
on
unwilling
parties,
and
indeed,
under
the
precise
facts--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--well,
the
mere
fact
that--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--what
makes
the
arrangement
unlawful
in
our
view
is
not
when
they
agree
with
hartford
not
to
offer
the
coverage,
but
when
they
agree
with
hartford
not
to
offer
the
coverage
as
the
means
of
prohibiting
hartford's
competitors
from
offering
the
coverage.
so
the
mere
fact
that
you
may
have
multiple
levels
of
the
distribution
system
involved
in
the
agreement
isn't
what
makes
it
lawful
or
unlawful.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
single
motive
and
lawful
objective
would
necessarily
be
obtained
by
lawful
means.
the
antitrust
laws
permit
a
wide
variety
of
results
to
occur,
but
still
prohibits
those
same
results
when
the
results
are
obtained
by
means
prohibited
by
the
antitrust
law,
and
that's
the
primary
difference
between
section
1
of
the
law
and
section
2.
section
2
comes
closer,
sometimes,
to
prohibiting
specific
results,
but
section
1
always
focuses
almost
exclusively
on
the
means
utilized
to
obtain
those
results,
and
thus
means
are
very
important.
further
addressing
the
general
area
that
justice
scalia
has
directed
me
to,
i
would
just
briefly
say
that
where
unregulated
conduct
becomes
an
integral
part
of
an
unlawful
scheme,
then
all
the
parties
to
that
scheme
are
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
it.
the
mere
fact
that
some
of
them
might
have
had
an
exemption
for
some
conduct
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
they're
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
full
scope
of
the
conspiracy,
and
where
regulated
and
otherwise
exempt
activities
are
engaged
in
in
furtherance
of
the
underlying
unlawful
scheme,
then
whatever
exemption
they
enjoy
has
been
lost,
and
that's
simply
a
specialized
application
of
the
general
proposition
that
acts
lawful
in
themselves
lose
that
character
when
they
become
a
constituent
element
of
an
overriding
and
otherwise
unlawful
scheme.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
in
the
antitrust
context,
specifically
that
language
is
a
paraphrase
from
the
continental
ore
v.
union
carbide
case,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
both
for
that
proposition
and
for
several
related
principles
in
the
international
comity
area.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
it
did
not
involve
exempt
and
nonexempt,
it
involved
the
combination
of
lawful
and
unlawful.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
the
cases
that
deal
with
the
exempt
and
nonexempt,
this
case's
whole...
or,
statement
in
royal
drug,
the
pennington...
united--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--mineworkers
v.
pennington,
and
the
whole
host
of
labor
and
related--
mr.
laurel
a.
price
--but
in
perino,
the
only
question
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
activity
engaged
in
was
the
business
of
insurance,
and
so
this
court
said,
in
determining
the
first
prong
of
the
mccarran
test
for
exemption,
the
mere
fact
that
a
party
to
the
agreement
was
not
an
insurer
was
not
itself
dispositive
of
whether
the
activity
engaged
in
was
the
business
of
insurance.
it
didn't
address
the
additional
question
of
whether
that
party
in
activity
was
entitled
the
exemption,
because
it
hadn't
addressed
whether
or
not
its
activity
was
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
mccarran,
so
i
don't
believe
that
perino
is
dispositive
for
that
purpose.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
it
is
the
only
authority
where
this
court
has
directly
addressed
that
proposition
in
the
context
of
the
insurance
industry.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
i'll
turn
to
that
now.
where
foreign
parties
conspire,
intending
to
and
substantially
restraining
american
commerce,
this
court
has
consistently
applied
our
antitrust
laws
to
that
conduct.
indeed,
the
test
that
the
sherman
act
cases
have
applied
have
generally
applied
a
two-pronged
analysis:
whether
there
was
an
intent
to
harm
american
commerce,
and
whether
the
conduct
charged
had
a
substantial
effect
on
american
commerce.
when
you
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case,
americans
went
to
london
to
solicit
the
participation
of
london
reinsurers
for
the
purpose
of
disciplining
american
reinsurance
markets.
the
agreements
were
specifically
targeted
at
the
united
states.
if
one
looks
at
the
nonmarine
london
agreement
1987,
the
very
words
of
the
agreement
itself
were,
"to
use
their
best
endeavors
to
ensure
that
all
usa
and
canadian-exposed
risks
would
not
have
reinsurance
for
pollution
available.
"
when
one
looks
at
the
effects
in
this
case,
50
percent
of
lloyd's
business
is
in
north
america.
lloyd's
is
the
largest
reinsurer
of
american
business.
all
the
competitive
effects
addressed
in
the
complaint
occurred
in
the
united
states.
it
was
americans
rather
than
britons
who
were
unable
to
obtain
long-tail
and
pollution
coverage
as
a
result
of
this
conspiracy.
when
one
looks
at
reinsurance
markets,
one
thing
that
is
immediately
apparent
is
that
they
are
international
in
nature,
and
that
includes
the
london
market.
indeed,
defendants
concede
as
much.
what
i
would
posit
to
the
court
is
that,
given
the
international
nature
of
this
market
and
american
markets'
dependence
on
it,
the
statement
that
the
british
government
possesses
the
sole
regulatory
interest
in
how
business
is
conducted
in
that
market
is
misleading
and,
indeed,
false.
i
would
hypothesize
the
following
case.
assume
the
british
adopted
a
statute
which
said
that
it
was
in
britain's
interest
to
promote
the
manufacture
of
products
for
sale
in
the
united
states
which
were
inherently
dangerous
and
which
were
not
required
to
be
done
with
adequate
safeguards.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
concluding
that
american
state
product
liability
law
should
apply
to
that
conduct
even
though
the
british
have
articulated
a
regulatory
interest
in
that
conduct.
when
you
look
at
the
jurisdictional
test
which
derives
from
alcoa,
from
the
continental
ore
case,
and
the
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
the
notion
of
comity
is
inherent
in
that
test
because
the
comity
question
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
is
the
question
of
whether
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstance
of
a
particular
case.
and
the
way
that
we
have
determined
reasonableness
is
by
looking
to
see
whether
there
was
an
intent
to
harm
american
commerce
and
whether
american
commerce
was
substantially
affected,
and
i
suggest
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
confusion
in
the
lower
courts,
it
relates
not
to
the
intent
and
effects
standard,
but
a
failure
to
give
meaning
to
the
substantiality
of
the
effect
before
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
is
appropriate.
when
you
look
at
the
timberlane
case
itself,
you
didn't
need
a
9-factor
or
a
7-factor
or
a
10-factor
test
to
tell
you
11/100ths
of
1
percent
of
american
lumber
coming
from
honduras
probably
wasn't
a
substantial
effect
and
probably
wasn't
the
sort
of
circumstance
where
it
would
be
reasonable
for
an
american
court
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
it
would
clearly
be
subject
to
scrutiny
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
whether
or
not
it's
unlawful,
we
don't
have
a
record
that
will
tell
us
that
at
this
point.
we
certainly
could,
sir.
indeed,
in
a
related
and
analogous
case
this
court
unanimously
said
in
kirkpatrick
that
this
court
would
not
allow
vague
notions
of
comity
to
serve
as
the
basis
by
which
american
courts
would
abstain
from
the
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction,
and
indeed
expressly
allowed
as
how
courts
in
the
united
states
have
the
power
and
ordinarily
the
obligation
to
decide
the
cases
presented
to
them.
mr.
laurel
a.
price
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
wish
to
say
whether
it's
unflagging
or
not.
it
does
admit
to
at
least
some
narrow
exceptions,
and
the
exceptions
that
this
court
has
recognized
are
the
active
state
cases
where
it's
narrowly
confined
to
its
role
as
a
rule
of
decision,
and
we
would
also
submit
that
circumstances
which
related
to
foreign
sovereign
compulsion
might
also,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
be
cases
where
jurisdiction
might
be
inappropriate.
but
the
level
of
conflicts
posited
in
this
case
by
the
british
government
i
do
not
believe
are
the
sort
that
this
court
ought
to
give
deference
to.
the
policy
posited
by
the
united
kingdom
is
one
of
a
system
of
self-regulation,
and
thus
the
british
government
is,
at
best,
merely
neutral
as
to
whether
this
conduct
occurred
or
did
not
occur.
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
actors
under
that
self-regulatory
system
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
or
not
to
act.
thank
you.
