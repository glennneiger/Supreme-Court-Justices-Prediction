we'll
hear
argument
next
in
91-1111,
hartford
fire
insurance
company
v.
california
consolidated
with
merrett
underwriting
agency
v.
california.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
then,
do
you
do
with
the
language
in
royal
drug
company,
mr.
shapiro,
about
when
you
conspire
or
agree
with
someone
who's
not
protected
the
exempt
party
loses
the
exemption?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here's
the
statement
from
royal
drug,
mr.
shapiro,
and
it's
obviously
one
sentence
out
of
a
long
opinion.
it
says,
"in
analogous
context
the
court
has
held
that
an
exempt
entity
forfeits
antitrust
exemption
by
acting
in
concert
with
nonexempt
parties.
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
ms.
boast.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
boast.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
price,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
could
do
that
without
any
agreement.
well,
that's
precisely
the
question.
i
mean,
there's
no
consideration,
though,
the
way
you've
described
it.
what
consideration
flows
from
the
reinsurer
to
the
insurer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
were
the
two...
to
have
an
agreement,
you
have
an
exchange
of
promises
or
performance
on
both
sides,
in
contract
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
to
be...
what
did
the
insurer
agree
to
do
or
perform
in
exchange
for
the
reinsurer's
agreement
to
not
write
the
claims-made
forms?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you
say
that
was
an
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you've
said
that
what
the
reinsurers
agreed
to
do
was
not
to
reinsure
any
more
claims-made
forms,
but
what
did
the
insurers
agree
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
that
an
agreement
they
made
with
the
reinsurers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
saying,
then,
that
there
wasn't
an
agreement
between
the
insurers
and
the
reinsurers,
that
the
insurers
agreed
among
themselves
and
then
went
to
the
reinsurers
to
put
muscle
into
the
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
agreed
in
exchange
for
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
your
authority
for
that,
mr.
price?
i
mean,
in
the
antitrust
context?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
involved
exempt
and
nonexempt--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
does
one
principal
necessarily
carry
over
to
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about
the
statement
in
perino,
coming
after
royal
drug,
that
the
fact
that
an
exempt...
deals
with
nonexempt
is
a
factor,
but
it
isn't
controlling?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
royal
drug
is
your
principal
authority
for
the
proposition
that
you
stated
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
price.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
