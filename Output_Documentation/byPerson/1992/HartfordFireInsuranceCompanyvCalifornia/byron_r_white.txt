justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say,
then,
that
ca
9
was
wrong
in
holding
that
your
clients
conspired
with
some
companies,
some
foreign
companies
that
were
not
subject
to
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
suppose...
suppose
that
it
was
true
that
your
clients
conspired
with
foreign
companies
that
were
not
subject
to
state
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
how
is
it...
why
is
it,
then,
that
if
you're...
that
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
this
immunity
if
you
conspired
with
somebody
outside
the
insurance
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what's
the
reason?
the
reason
is
that
that
person
outside
the
insurance
industry
is
not
subject
to
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
reason,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
haven't
told
me
why,
if
your
clients
conspired
with
people
outside
the
insurance
industry,
you
would
not
have
mccarran
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
that
if
your
clients
conspired
with
someone
outside
the
insurance
industry,
you
wouldn't
have
mccarran
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
say
that,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
royal
drug
looks
in
the
direction.
then,
why
would
it
have
said
that
you
wouldn't
have
had
mccarran
immunity
if
you
conspired
with
somebody
outside
the
insurance
industry?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
might...
i
think
you're
just
not
answering
the
question,
and
i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time
by
insisting
that
you
do,
so
go
right
ahead,
mr.
shapiro.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
an
agreement
to
enter
into
whatever
kind
of
a
boycott
this
was,
conditional
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
justice
department
has
just
got
it
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
whom
do
you
represent?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
going
to
get
to
the
comity
issue?
