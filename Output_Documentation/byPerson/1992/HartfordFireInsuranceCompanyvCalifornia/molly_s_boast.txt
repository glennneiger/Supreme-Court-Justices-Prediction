mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
claims
at
issue
in
this
petition
allege
agreements
among
the
london
reinsurer
defendants
in
these
cases,
in
whose
behalf
i
speak,
to
exclude
coverages
desired
by
respondents
from
treaty
reinsurance
written
in
london.
the
question
before
the
court
on
this
petition--
ms.
molly
s.
boast
--the
london
reinsurer
defendants.
ms.
molly
s.
boast
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
petition
is
whether
the
reach
of
the
united
states
antitrust
laws
should
be
restrained
to
require
a
dismissal
of
these
claims,
which
attack
british
subjects
for
conduct
openly
undertaken
in
a
british-regulated
market.
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
must
be
yes.
the
claims
at
issue...
it
is
important
to
give
a
little
bit
of
context
to
this.
treaty
reinsurance
is
written
to
cover
large
bundles
of
risks
presented
by
primary
insurers.
the
subscription
nature
of
the
lloyd's
marketplace
gives
it
the
capacity
to
absorb
risks
of
a
magnitude
that
probably
cannot
be
absorbed
elsewhere.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
claims
that
plaintiffs
sought
to
purchase
treaty
reinsurance.
there
is
also
no
allegation
in
these
claims
that
these
agreements
were
entered
at
the
behest
of
any
american
actor,
or
that
these
london
reinsurer
defendants
sought
to
serve
anyone's
interest
but
their
own.
this
court
has
never
upheld
the
exercise
of
antitrust
jurisdiction
in
comparable
circumstances.
the
process
that
is
employed
to
assess
the
limits
of
jurisdictional
reach...
the
weighing
of
competing
sovereign
interests,
the
search
for
links
of
nationality
and
territory,
and
the
discerning
consideration
of
the
expectations
of
the
parties
in
the
international
system,
is
not
new
to
this
court.
it
is
reflected
in
decisions
ranging
from
lauritzen
v.
larsen
to
mitsubishi
v.
soler
chrysler-plymouth
to,
most
recently,
the
asahi
case.
all
of
these
cases
were
decided
by
this
court
in
favor
of
the
result
that
would
lend
the
greatest
stability
to
international
commerce,
even
where
that
meant
foregoing
the
united
states'
interest
in
the
application
of
its
own
laws
or
the
availability
of
the
united
states
courts
as
a
forum.
if
the
court
applies
the
rationale
of
those
cases
here,
it
will
be
compelled
to
dismiss
these
claims.
this
case
was
decided
by
the
courts
below
on
the
authority
of
timberlane
lumber
company
v.
bank
of
america,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
decision
that
created
a
jurisdictional
rule
of
reason
for
determining
when
the
full
reach
of
jurisdiction
should
be
moderated.
under
timberlane
and
under
the
restatement,
third,
of
the
foreign
relations
law
of
the
united
states,
the
existence
of
effects
in
the
forum
state
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
analysis.
both
authorities
ask,
even
if
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
exists,
is
the
interest
of
another
state
so
overwhelming
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
would
be
unreasonable?
here,
that
inquiry
leads
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
the
potential
reach
of
the
sherman
act
must
be
tempered.
the
primary
consideration
in
the
inquiry
is
the
avoidance
of
conflict
with
the
law
and
policy
of
another
state.
the
conflict
in
this
case
is
graphic.
here,
the
application
of
american
competition
policy
would
conflict
with
the
united
kingdom's
interest,
which
it
has
quite
vehemently
stated,
in
protecting
its
regulatory
scheme
from
the
intrusion
of
incompatible
standards
under
the
u.s.
antitrust
laws.
those
standards
are
incompatible
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
united
kingdom's
entire
regulatory
framework
is
designed
to
accommodate
collective
underwriting
and
to
encourage
prudent
risk-taking
within
that
framework.
that's
the
very
essence
of
the
conduct
respondents
seek
to
deter
with
the
treble
damages
remedy
in
these
claims.
second,
the
united
kingdom
takes
the
position
that
it
is
the
guardian
of
its
own
internal
markets.
it
has
not
chosen
unfettered
competition
for
this
market
because
it
considers
that
incompatible
with
its
duty
to
protect
the
solvency
and
reliability
of
this
very
important
segment
of
its
industry.
ms.
molly
s.
boast
in
these
claims,
that's
correct.
the
united
kingdom
considers
itself
the
authority
which
should
alter
the
competitive
conditions
in
the
marketplace
if
they
are
to
be
altered
at
all.
now,
respondents
in
the
united
states
complain
that
this
conflict
is
not
severe
enough
to
be
recognized.
there
are
really
three
answers
to
this.
the
first
is
the
obvious.
the
united
kingdom
says
there
is
a
conflict
and
their
statement
should
be
determinative
of
their
view,
at
least,
that
there's
a
conflict.
secondly,
the
standard
that's
advanced
by
the
united
states
and
by
the
respondents
wouldn't
really
require
the
interest
balancing
that
we
advocate
because
the
sovereign
would
have
acted
and
that
act
would
have
been...
have
to
be
given
deference.
thirdly,
this
court
has
recognized
just
this
kind
of
conflict
before.
in
lauritzen
v.
larsen,
this
court
held
that
the
workers
compensation
laws
of
the
american
states
should
not
apply
to
reward
a
danish
seaman
because
the
american
award,
even
though
greater,
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
denmark's
interest
in
the
exclusivity
of
its
own
scheme.
there
was
no
question
there
that
the
two
sets
of
laws
could
have
been
applied
without
imposing
conflicting
commands
on
the
shipowner.
the
court
of
appeals
gutted
the
significance
of
this
conflict,
although...
in
the
jurisdictional
analysis,
although
it
accepted
it
by
applying
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act
in
a
manner
that
was
contrary
to
that
statute's
terms
and
legislative
history.
the
statute
was
designed
to
limit
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
to
united
states
companies
doing
business
abroad--
ms.
molly
s.
boast
--it
was
a
jones
act.
ms.
molly
s.
boast
that's
correct.
ms.
molly
s.
boast
our
position
is
not
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply
in
the
sense
that
a
minimal
basis
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
doesn't
exist
here.
our
position
is
that
there
are
certain
circumstances,
and
that
this
is
one
of
them,
in
which
the
interests
of
another
state
are
sufficient
that
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
should
be
restrained.
ms.
molly
s.
boast
if
the
court
is
comfortable
with
that
conclusion
on
this
record,
i'd
be
perfectly
happy--
ms.
molly
s.
boast
--but
the
difference
is
simply
that
some
might
not
be
comfortable
with
that
conclusion
on
this
point
on
the
record.
that
is
to
say
that
that
reflects
a
merits
determination.
the
rule
we're
advocating
is
designed
to
make
courts
ask
the
question
at
the
outset,
is
there
a
sufficient
united
states
interest
here
to
warrant
proceeding,
or
should
it
give
way,
and
that
inquiry
we
believe
should
be
undertaken
at
the
earliest
possible
alternative
in
any
case.
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act,
as
i
mentioned,
was
designed
to
limit
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
to
united
states
companies
doing
business
abroad,
but
it
left
unaffected
the
jurisdictional
determination
for
import
commerce
from
other
nations.
no
new
jurisdictional
hurdle
needed
to
be
overcome,
but
the
international
character
of
the
transaction
was
to
be
fully
considered
and
the
legislative
history
explicitly
referred
to
the
timberlane
decision
as
the
kind
of
analysis
that
might
be
undertaken.
the
district
court
held
that
this
act
did
not
apply,
and
hence
made
its
findings
of
effects
under
the
first
two
steps
of
timberlane's
rule
of
reason
the
governing
authority
for
that
court.
the
court
of
appeals
somehow
found
that
the...
without
identifying
how,
found
its
effects
under
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act.
it
perceived
these
effects
to
be
effects
that
surpassed
this
new
threshold
in
the
statute
and,
thus,
it
gave
them
such
weight
that
it
vitiated
the
united
kingdom's
interest
in
the
course
of
applying
the
remainder
of
the
balancing
process.
we
think
this
was
plainly
wrong,
but
we
also
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
be
wrong
even
if
there
were
no
conflict
and
even
if
the
ninth
circuit
hadn't
misapplied
the
foreign
trade
antitrust
improvements
act.
unlike
every
other
case
that
has
come
before
this
court,
the
claims
at
issue
here
involve
only
british
actors
in
alleged
conspiracies
implemented
only
in
london
and
undertaken
for
what
both
courts
acknowledged
were
legitimate
business
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
completely
ignored
the
significance
of
these
features.
first,
it
did
not
consider
at
all
the
wholly
foreign
center
of
the
activity,
even
though
the
locus
of
the
conduct
is
fundamental
in
international
law.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
nationality
of
the
parties--
ms.
molly
s.
boast
--other
than
the
global
conspiracy
which
mr.
shapiro
addressed
and
which
is
not
before
this
court,
there
is
no
allegation
linking
these
three
claims
i'm
talking
about
to
the
other
claims
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
nationality
of
the
factor's
party
is
designed
to
determine
which
state
has
the
greater
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
at
issue.
the
focal
point
of
the
inquiry
should
be
the
nationality
of
the
parties
who
would
be
regulated
by
the
application
of
u.s.
law,
and
in
a
case
where
you
had
both
american
and
foreign
defendants,
that
inquiry
would
be
illuminating.
here,
it
doesn't
happen
to
teach
us
very
much
because
we
have
only
british
nationals
as
defendants
and
obviously
the
united
kingdom's
interest
is
bigger...
greater.
the
court
of
appeals
attached
significance
to
the
fact
that
petitioners
had
not
contested
the
foreseeability
of
effects
in
the
united
states,
but
london
reinsurers
do
business
every
day
with
brokers
presenting
risks
from
around
the
world,
and
exclusions
of
all
sorts
are
included
in
treaty
terms.
this
enables
the
foreseeability
of
remote
impacts
in
locales
around
the
world,
but
it
does
not
mean
that
reinsurers
foresee
the
possibility
of
violating
the
law
or
of
being
hailed
into
courts
around
the
world.
if
each
nation
that
felt
such
an
impact
felt
that
it
was
permitted
to
try
to
change
the
rules
and
practices
in
the
london
market,
the
players
in
the
market
would
be
subject
to
multiple
and
overlapping
sets
of
instructions,
and
it
would
grind
to
a
halt.
if
the
same
kinds
of
intrusions
were
inflicted
on,
for
example,
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
surely
this
nation
would
object.
only
one
state's
rules
can
govern
here.
the
united
kingdom
is
the
only
state
with
a
persistent,
continuing
interest
in
the
economic
regulation
of
its
own
reinsurance
markets.
it
has
asserted
that
united
states
antitrust
laws
conflict
with
its
economic
regulatory
goals.
where
the
economic
interests
of
the
united
states
are
as
minimal
as
they
are
here,
this
nation's
greater
interest
in
the
orderly
allocation
of
jurisdiction
in
the
international
system
requires
that
the
claims
be
dismissed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
