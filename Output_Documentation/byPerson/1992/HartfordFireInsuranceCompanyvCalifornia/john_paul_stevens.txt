justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
just
on
that?
they
have
alleged,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
that
the
reinsurers
agreed
not
to
provide
reinsurance
to
companies
that
wrote
the
kind
of
coverage
that
they
didn't
want.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not...
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
that's...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
would...
would
you
say
that's
a
boycott
within...
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
won't
write
them
even
if
they're
not
reinsuring
the
insurance
they
don't
want
to...
the...
you
know,
the
kind
they
don't
want.
they
will
not
reinsure
the
company
if
the
company
writes
that
kind
of
insurance
that
might
be
reinsured
with
someone
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
87a
says--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
i
read
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
had
alleged
further
we
won't
do
business
with
you
if
you
do
this
kind
of
business,
that
would
be
a
boycott.
you
would
agree
with
that.
but
you
say
that's
not
what
they've
alleged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
refusal
to
deal,
unless
you,
the
insurance
company,
only
writes
that
kind
of
insurance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
conditional
or
an
absolute
refusal,
as
you
described
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
long
as
you
don't
write
a
different
kind
of
insurance--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
agree
if
that
were
alleged,
that
would
be
a
boycott.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
shapiro,
under
your
solvency
point,
are
you
arguing
that
if
hartford
and
allstate
agreed
with
the
reinsurers
that
we
will
not
do
business
with
you
because
we're
concerned
about
your
solvency
if
you
reinsure
companies
that
write
the
kind
of
insurance
we
don't
want
written?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
we
won't
deal
with
you
if
you
deal
with
competitors
who
write
the
insurance
that
we
don't
want
to
write.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
read
paragraph
64
and
that
sequence
of
events
as
indicating
that
hartford
and
allstate
went
to
the
reinsurers
and
said
we
want
to
get
you
to
stop
reinsuring
this
other
kind
of
insurance,
and
in
effect
we
won't
do
business
with
you
unless
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
misreading
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
this
meeting,
hartford
and
general
rate
agreed
to
either
coerce
iso
to
adopt
their
demands
or,
failing
that,
derail
the
entire
iso-cgl
forms
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
any
impact
on
third
parties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
by
people
who
buy
insurance,
but
with
competitors.
