well,
mr.
shapiro,
i
know
you've
gone
over
this
already,
but
i'm
still
not
sure.
it
appeared
to
me
that
what
the
plaintiffs
below
alleged
was
that
your
client
tried
to
alter
the
terms
that
other
primary
insurers
would
offer,
and
alleged
that
your
clients
tried
to
compel
iso
to
change
the
forms
that
all
primary
insurers
would
offer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
those
are
the
allegations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
those
are
the
allegations,
does
that
not
fit
what
was
said
in
barry,
that
there
was
pressure
brought
on
iso
and
the
uncooperative
other
primary
insurers
to
change
their
conduct
by
enlisting
reinsurers
and
so
forth?
