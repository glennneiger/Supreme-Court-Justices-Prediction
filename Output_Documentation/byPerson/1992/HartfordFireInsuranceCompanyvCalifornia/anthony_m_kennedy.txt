justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying...
is
the
thrust
of
your
submission
at
this
point
that
it's
not
a
boycott
because
there
was
a
legitimate
reason
for
the
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
the
primary
insurers
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
solvency
of
the
reinsurers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
a
difference.
if
the
primary
insurer
is
involved,
then
the
primary
insurer
is
using
its
influence
or
economic
force
in
order
to
impose
standards
on
competitors,
and
that
is
what
a
boycott
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
reinsurers
all
agree
that
they're
going
to
issue
only
certain
forms...
certain...
of
insurance,
that's
not
a
boycott,
but
if
the
primary
insurer
is
involved,
then
the
primary
insurer
is
forcing
certain
standards
on
its
competitors,
and
that's
a
boycott.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
wrong
to
say
that
the
reinsurers
under
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
together
with
some
of
the
primary
insurers,
were
trying
to
change
the
market
practices
of
their
competitors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
get
that
out
of
the
allegations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
from
the
standpoint
of
defining
the
word,
boycott,
or
the
juridical
concept,
boycott,
if
the
reinsurers
had
come
up
with
this
idea
on
their
own,
and
they
had
met,
and
they
had
said,
we're
not
going
to
offer
reinsurance
for
this
particular
kind
of
coverage,
boycott
or
no?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
well,
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
take
the
simple
case
and
assume
for
discussion
that
that
is
not
a
boycott,
does
it
become
a
boycott
when
a
primary
insurer
participates
in
the
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that?
what
is
the
definitional
part
of
"boycott"
that
makes
this
distinction
for
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
whole
antitrust
exemption
is
based
on
a
quite
different
philosophy.
the
whole
antitrust
exemption
is
based
on
the
philosophy
that
this
kind
of
interaction
and
cooperation
is
beneficial
to
the
industry
as
a
whole.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
allegation
and
the
proof
were
that
the
sole
motive
of
the
primary
insurers
in
making
these
overtures
was
the
continued
solvency
of
the
reinsurers,
would
that
be
an
unlawful
boycott?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
the
primary
insurers
said,
there
is
a
glitch
in
a
lot
of
these
policies,
our
principal
concern
is
the
preservation
of
lloyd's
as
an
effective
reinsurer,
we
are
advising
you
that
in
your
interest
and
in
ours
from
the
standpoint
of
the
solvency
of
reinsurers,
you
should
not
offer
this
coverage.
is
that
unlawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
as
a
result
of
those
overtures
the
reinsurers
got
together
and
said,
you
know,
hartford
and
its...
other
companies
like
it
are
absolutely
correct.
we
will
now
agree
together
not
to
offer
this
other
form
of
insurance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that
hypothesis,
are
the
primary
insurers
violating
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
many
effects
can
follow
from
a
single
motive,
and
i'm
hypothesizing
a
single
motive
which
i
suggest
to
you
may
be
lawful.
