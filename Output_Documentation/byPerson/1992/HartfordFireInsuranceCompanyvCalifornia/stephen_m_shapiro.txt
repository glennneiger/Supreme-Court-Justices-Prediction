mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
domestic
insurance
defendants
who
are
petitioners
in
case
number
91-1111.
we're
hear
today
to
contend
that
the
ninth
circuit's
forfeiture
ruling
in
this
case
was
wrong,
and
in
addition
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
overturning
judge
schwarzer's
decision
on
the
mccarran
boycott
issue.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
the
domestic
defendants
forfeited
their
mccarran
act
immunity
by
acting
in
concert
with
foreign
reinsurers,
and
it
held
in
addition
that
their
conduct
amounted
to
a
boycott
within
the
meaning
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
on
the
forfeiture
issue,
we
agree
with
the
justice
department
that
the
domestic
defendants,
which
both
courts
below
found
were
engaged
in
the
regulated
business
of
insurance,
did
not
forfeit
their
immunity
simply
by
acting
in
concert
with
foreign
reinsurers.
the
government
properly
points
out
that
the
mccarran
immunity
literally
focuses
on
the
regulated
business
of
insurance
and
does
not
focus
narrowly
on
the
regulated
status
of
each
participant
in
that
process.
congress
understood
when
it
passed
the
mccarran
act
that
domestic
insurers
would
enter
into
agreements
with
reinsurers,
including
foreign
reinsurers,
and
it
believed
that
antitrust
immunity
would
extend
to
these
insurance
practices.
under
this
statute,
the
exemption
of
domestic
insurers
does
not
simply
vanish
when
they
deal
with
entities
such
as
consumer
groups
or
risk
managers
or
foreign
reinsurers,
all
of
which
are
vital
participants
in
the
forms-developmentprocess
and
each
of
which
can
easily
be
characterized
as
a
nonexempt
entity
or
a
so-called
coconspirator.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
royal
drug,
your
honor,
was
talking
about
the
business
of
insurance
requirement,
which
concededly
is
satisfied
here,
and
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
satisfied
there
was
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
an
insurance
company
and
somebody
outside
of
the
insurance
industry.
now,
in
this
case
everybody
is
within
the
insurance
industry
and
the
justice
department
properly
points
out
that
royal
drug
is
not
support
for
the
forfeiture
ruling
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
both
courts--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--both
courts
below
found
that
all
domestic
defendants,
including
the
reinsurers,
were
regulated
under
state
law,
and
the
justice
department
agrees
that
these
regulated
entities
that
are
acting
within
the
business
of
insurance
don't
lose
their
immunity
simply
because
they
enter
into
discussions
or
agreements
with
foreign
reinsurers.
the
issue
of
whether
they're
regulated
is
not
before
the
court
in
our
petition
or
in
any
cross-petition.
both
courts
below
correctly
decided
that
my
clients,
the
domestic
companies,
were
regulated.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
is
indeed
regulated
by
the
states
in
two
respects.
my
clients
are
accused
of
participating
in
the
forms-developmentprocess.
the
reinsurers
participated
in
the
forms-developmentprocess
along
with
the
primary
insurers.
the
states
had
plenary
jurisdiction
over
everybody
who
participated
in
the
forms-developmentprocess,
and
if
there
were
some
interaction
between
a
domestic
company
and
a
foreign
company,
that
could
be
regulated
with
the
unfair
insurance
practices
laws
which
all
50
states
have
enacted
and
which
this
court
squarely
held
is
enough
to
predicate
mccarran
immunity.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
98
percent
of
the
commercial
general
liability
policies
today
are
written
on
occurrence
forms.
it's
wrong
to
say
that
they've
been
eliminated,
although
the
complaint
alleges
that
they
have
been
reduced
in
quantity.
now,
if
a
state
insurance
regulator
believed
that
there
was
some
improper
concerted
action
that
was
constricting
the
flow
of
this
coverage
into
the
marketplace,
they
have
ample
means
under
state
unfair
insurance
practice
laws
to
deal
with
any
agreement
that
they
believe
is
contrary
to
public
policy.
these
laws
are
passed
in
all
50
states
for
the
very
purpose
of
taking
the
place
of
federal
antitrust
statutes
in
order
to
invoke
the
mccarran
immunity
for
the
industry,
and
they
reach
reinsurers
just
as
much
as
they
reach
primary
insurers.
the
district
court
so
concluded
after
extensive
briefing,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
no,
sir,
they
are
specifically
focused
on
the
insurance
industry.
these
are
model
laws
based
on
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners'
proposed
statute
right
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
south-eastern
case.
they
focus
precisely
on
insurance,
and
they
deal
with
anticompetitive
acts
in
the
insurance
industry.
this
court
held
squarely
in
the
national
casualty
case
in
the
fifties
that
if
the
states
pass
these
laws,
and
if
these
laws
embrace
the
anticompetitive
actions,
that,
standing
by
itself,
is
sufficient
for
mccarran
immunity
purposes,
and
that
precedent
has
been
followed
ever
since
and
the
industry
and
regulators
have
relied
on
it.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
do
cover
the
foreign
reinsurers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
that
is
wrong,
but
our
position
doesn't
depend
on
that,
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
would
still
be
entitled
to
mccarran
act--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--because
our
behavior
was
regulated
and
our
conduct
was
entirely
within
the
business
of
insurance.
if
there
was
some
interaction
between
a
domestic
company
and
a
foreign
company
that
was
improper,
we
could
be
told--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor,
because
that
is
not
deemed
the
business
of
insurance
under
the
royal
drug
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
that
isn't
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
reason
is
that
this
statute
was
focused
on
the
insurance
industry
as
such
and
not
on
other
industries.
now,
all
of
the
participants
here
are
within
the
insurance
business.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
because
their
own
conduct
is
regulated
by
the
states.
their
activities
are
within
the
scope
of
regulation.
their
action
is
the
business
of
insurance.
there's
no
dispute
here
that
this
is
all
the
business
of
insurance.
both
courts
below
concluded
it
was.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
later
in
the
pireno
case--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
not
strictly
correct,
because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
may
have
said
royal
drug
looked
in
that
direction,
but
there
is
a
later
case
from
this
court,
the
pireno
case,
that
said
that
that
is
merely
one
factor
that
the
court
considers.
it
isn't
decisive
on
the
question--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
reason
is
that
congress
was
focusing
in
on
insurance
and
reinsurance,
the
spreading
of
risk.
it
wasn't
focusing
on
pharmacy
agreements
of
the
kind
that
were
in
the
royal
drug
case.
that
was
beyond
congress'
intent.
now,
insurers
and
reinsurers--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--are
squarely--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
point
is
the
justice
department
agrees
with
us
that
you
don't
lose
your
immunity
just
because
you
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
somebody
that
isn't
regulated.
the
statute
isn't
focused
that
way.
there
are
many
people
that
are
not
regulated,
justice
white,
that
insurance
companies
routinely
agree
with...
risk
managers,
all...
consumer
groups
that
are
not
regulated...
you
can
call
them
nonexempt
entities,
but
they
are
still
within
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
and
they...
what...
in
context
they
are
talking
about
persons
that
are
not
within
the
insurance
business,
they
are
talking
about
pharmacies,
and
in
the
subsequent
case,
in
pireno,
this
court
drew
back
on
that
statement
and
said
that
it
doesn't
matter.
it
isn't
decisive
if
you
deal
with
somebody
even
outside
the
insurance
industry.
but
here,
everybody
is
within
the
insurance
industry.
this
is
exactly
what
congress
was
focusing
on.
congress
thought
insurance
and
reinsurance
were
within
the
zone
of
immunity
that
it
was
creating.
now,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
principal
question
here
is
whether
judge
schwarzer
or
the
ninth
circuit
got
the
mccarran
boycott
question
right,
and
in
assessing
the
legal
sufficiency
of
that
separate
question
in
the
case,
it's
essential
to
bear
in
mind
the
two
different
kinds
of
conduct
that
are
being
alleged
in
this
case.
the
first
is
forms
development.
plaintiffs
take
the
position
that
domestic
and
foreign
defendants
agreed
that
reinsurance
would
not
be
offered
on
certain
advisory
insurance
forms
that
had
been
proposed
unless
changes
were
made
in
those
forms.
now,
the
second
type
of
conduct
is
so-called
market
conduct.
plaintiffs
claim
that
the
foreign
defendants
jointly
decided
that
certain
coverages
would
not
be
reinsured.
they
tried
to
link
these
two
kinds
of
activity
together
through
a
global
conspiracy
claim
which
the
district
court
dismissed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
dismissal
with
an
opportunity
for
plaintiffs
to
offer
a
specific
amended
pleading
in
the
future.
that
is
further
down
the
road
in
this
case.
there
is
no
validly
stated
claim
of
global
conspiracy
in
the
case
at
this
time,
and
we've
explained
in
the
alternative
in
our
reply
brief
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
even
if
this
global
conspiracy
claim
ran
everybody
together
in
this
case,
domestic
and
foreigners,
because
plaintiffs
have
not
alleged
the
elements
of
a
mccarran
act
boycott.
now,
the
parties
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
on
the
forms
development--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
foreign
companies
are
accused
of
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
we
take
the
position
that
that
is
not,
it's
simply
insisting
on
mutually
acceptable
terms
of
coverage--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--for
the
customers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
read
the
complaints
in
context
they're
not
saying
that.
that
would
be
an
absolute
refusal
to
deal,
if
such
a
thing
were
asserted.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
mean,
if
you
read
the
whole
thing
in
context,
i
believe
they
are
saying
that
we
will
only
write
reinsurance
with
you,
particular
company,
if
you
are
willing
to
write
on
acceptable
terms.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
not
what's
alleged
here,
and
they
declined
to
defend,
or
to
argue
here
that
there
is
some
absolute
refusal
to
deal.
what
they
say
is
there
is
a
conditional
refusal
to
deal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
if
you
want--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
if
all
they
are
saying
is,
we
will
underwrite
any
insurance
that
you
proffer
as
long
as
it
has
the
following
terms--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
what's
not
alleged
here,
the
latter.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
agree
it
would
be
a
closer
question.
i
wouldn't
concede
it's
a
boycott,
but
it
would
be
a
closer
question.
it
sounds
more
like
an
absolute--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
agree
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
for
us
to
defend.
now,
the
parties
have--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--there
was
an
agreement,
but
it...
for
purposes
of
this
motion
that's
conceded,
but
it
isn't
a
boycott...
that's
our
whole
submission...
but
the
parties
may
agree
upon
acceptable
trade
terms
and
insist
that
others
comply
with
them.
there's
a
vivid
discussion
of
this
in
sullivan's
antitrust
treatise
at
page
257,
where
he
distinguishes
between
agreements
on
trade
terms
and
boycotts,
and
he
says,
"the
agreeing
parties
are
not
coercing
anyone,
at
least
in
the
usual
sense
of
that
word.
"
"they
are
merely,
though
concertedly,
saying,
we
will
deal
with
you
only
on
the
following
trade
terms.
"
and
he...
professor
sullivan
points
out
that
that
should
not
be
deemed
a
boycott,
even
under
the
sherman
act,
and
it
can't
be
deemed
a
boycott
under
the
mccarran
act,
because
the
mccarran
act
permits
insurance
companies
to
agree
among
themselves
on
acceptable
terms
and
conditions
and
coverages.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
justice
department
has
this
issue
wrong,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
particularly
on
the
forms-developmentclaims
that
our
clients
are
accused
of
participating
in.
the
parties
have
talked
about
this
at
great
length,
because
it
has
special,
practical
importance
to
this
industry.
congress
recognized
that
standardization
of
forms
is
critical
to
the
regulated
business
of
insurance,
and
it
recognized
that
there
must
be
agreement
among
insurers
and
reinsurers
if
these
forms
are
going
to
be
reinsured
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
plaintiffs
now
seem
to
acknowledge
that
this
process
of
forms
standardization,
even
with
blunt
opposition
to
unacceptable
terms
in
the
policies,
does
not
constitute
a
boycott,
and
in
our
view
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference.
the
primary
insurers,
"enlisted"
or
"encouraged"
reinsurers
to
announce
that
they
would
only
reinsure
if
certain
changes
were
made
in
these
proposed
forms,
and
that's
because
insurers
and
reinsurers
have
inseparable
interests
in
the
underlying
risks,
and
one
of
the
very
key
purposes
of
forms
standardization
is
to
make
sure
that
these
forms
will
be
reinsurable
after
the
forms
have
been
developed.
the
mccarran
act
rests
on
congress'
judgment
that
this
industry
is
unique,
and
agreements
in
this
industry
promote
insurer
solvency
and
consumer
welfare
even
though
they
have
anticompetitive
effects.
that
was
congress'
judgment
in
passing
this
law.
congress
left
it
to
state
insurance
regulators
to
decide
which
agreements
were
permitted
and
which
were
prohibited.
under
the
mccarran
act,
it
is
simply
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
talk
about
a
boycott
of
unacceptable
terms
or
coverages
or
forms
as
plaintiffs
do
through
these
complaints.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
rationale
is
the
solvency
rationale.
insurers
and
reinsurers
are
closely
interlinked.
the
solvency
of
the
reinsurer
is
vitally
important
to
the
insurer.
if
the
reinsurer
becomes
insolvent,
the
insurer
is
left
holding
the
bag,
so
if
the
reinsurer
is
writing
imprudent
coverages
with
great
exposures
to
great
risks
that
can't
be
quantified
and
underwritten,
that
is
a
risk
to
the
primary
insurer
as
well.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
boycott
exception
was
focused
on
something
completely
different
than
agreements
of
this
kind
that
can
promote
solvency
and
rationale
underwriting
of
risks.
congress
was
concerned
with
ganging
up
on
disfavored
persons,
whether
they
were
consumers
or
whether
they
were
businesses,
through
organized
refusals
to
deal
with
those
persons
or
discrimination,
especially
where--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no,
your
honor.
our
position
is
it
wasn't
a
boycott
because
this
was
a
uniform,
nondiscriminatory
agreement
that
applied
to
everybody
the
same
way.
it
didn't
single
anyone
else
out
and
disfavor
anybody
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
it's
generically
true
if
it
is
a
general,
uniform,
nondiscriminatory
agreement
on
terms
and
coverage.
congress
meant
state
insurance
regulators
to
decide
if
that
is
a
good
or
bad
thing.
now,
congress'
rationale,
justice
kennedy,
was
that
there
may
be
good
societal
purposes
for
such
agreements,
and
if
there
is
potential
good,
it's
for
the
insurance
regulator
and
not
an
antitrust
court
that
applies
the
blunt
sanction
of
federal
antitrust,
just
looking
to
competition,
not
looking
to
solvency
concerns,
not
looking
for
other
societal
concerns.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we're
not
arguing
that
position,
justice
stevens.
that
sounds
close
to
being
an
absolute,
as
we've
discussed,
an
absolute
refusal
to
deal,
that
we
won't
deal
with
you
at
all
if--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we're
not
defending
that,
because
here
something
different
is
being
asserted.
our
clients
merely
said,
we
won't
underwrite
a
particular
kind
of
policy
because
it's
a
threat
to
our
financial
interest.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
the
reinsurers
and
the
insurers
both
agreed
as
to
that,
as
to
the
standardized
advisory
forms
that
they
both
used
in
their
business.
it
was
a
threat
to
them
because
of
the
expansion
of
tort
liability.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
your
honor,
that
isn't--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
there
is
no
contention
that
hartford
and
the
other
primaries
twisted
the
arm
of
the
reinsurers.
what
is
alleged
is
that
hartford
and
the
other
primaries
did
not
want
to
use
this
coverage
in
their
business
because
it
was
not
a
prudent
coverage.
they
conferred,
they
encouraged
the
reinsurers
to
examine
the
issue
and
state
that
they
would
not
cover
this
particular
risk
in
their
own
business,
too.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
what
plaintiffs
mean
by
coerce
is
simply
that
the
insurers
and
the
reinsurers
agree
that
certain
coverages
are
unacceptable
to
them.
they
attach
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
there
always
is
an
impact
on
third
parties,
but
that
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--every
agreement
among
insurance
companies
as
to
terms
and
coverages
is
going
to
have
an
impact
on
somebody
that
wants
to
do
business
on
different
terms,
and
congress
well
understood
that
there
would
be
anticompetitive
effects
from
these
agreements,
but
it
said
because
they
may
potentially
serve
other
societal
interests,
it's
as
a
jurisdictional
matter.
it's
up
to
the
state
insurance
regulators
to
decide
this,
not
an
antitrust
court,
and
a
jury
that
applies
generalized
antitrust
criteria,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
would
be
laughable.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
be
preposterous.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
be
preposterous.
the...
if
you
look
at
best's
insurance
company
statistics,
these
four
american
primaries
have
a
minuscule
piece
of
the
market.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
there
isn't
any
coercion
alleged
among
the
reinsurers
and
the
insurers.
now,
we
think
it's
very
telling
that
in
the
barry
case
this
court
went
to
such
great
lengths
to
draw
a
distinction
between
terms
of
coverage
and
insurance
policies
and
boycotts,
and
the
carefully
balanced
opinion
in
this
case,
which
plaintiffs
are
running
roughshod
over,
was
the
product,
in
part,
of
an
amicus
submission
from
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners,
and
this
is
what
they
said
in
their
amicus
brief
that
preceded
this
court's
opinion
in
barry,
and
if
i
may
quote,
"a
broad
construction
of
the
boycott
exception
would
place
insurance
forms
development
and
the
state
approval
mechanism
in
conflict
with
federal
antitrust.
"
they
went
further,
and
said,
"whenever
a
policyholder
did
not
obtain
the
precise
coverage
he
desired,
such
as
a
policy
with
unlimited
coverage,
the
policyholder
could
easily
frame
an
antitrust
complaint
in
terms
of
alleged
insurer
refusal
to
deal.
"
now,
in
this
case,
these
very
fears
expressed
by
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
had
become
realities,
and
i
think
it's
also
telling
that
my
opponents,
faced
with
the
barry
opinion,
concede
that
primary
insurers
may
agree
on
acceptable
terms.
the
justice
department
said
it
wouldn't
matter
if
that
completely
eliminated
a
coverage
from
the
marketplace
in
their
brief
in
the
court
below.
they
don't
seem
to
doubt
that
reinsurers
may
agree
as
to
their
own
terms
without
that
being
a
boycott.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
reinsurers
are
insurance
companies
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance.
they
don't
dispute
that
insurers
and
reinsurers
may
agree
as
to
their
own
terms,
but
they
speculate
that
if
the
insurers
cause
the
reinsurers
to
adopt
general
coverage
terms
that
somebody
else
may
not
like,
all
of
a
sudden
this
is
transformed
into
a
boycott.
we
say--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
just
an
exercise
in
rhetorical
characterization.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
doesn't
address
that,
but
we
understand
the
plaintiffs
not
to
dispute
that
from--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
possible
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
don't
think
they
would
take
the
position
it's
a
boycott,
though,
if
we
overcome
the
regulation
hurdle.
i
don't
think
they
would
characterize
just
an
agreement
on
terms
among
insurers--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they
would
take
the
position...
well,
they
left
open
in
a
footnote
the
question
whether
reinsurers
are
regulated.
they
didn't
take
a
position
on
it.
the
reason
they
didn't
is
that
the
courts
below
had
dealt
with
this
issue.
no
cross-petition
was
addressed
to
it,
and
we
don't
believe
it's
before
the
court.
now,
congress'
rationale
in
making
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--justice
kennedy,
the
reason
it
can't
be
twisted
into
a
boycott
is
that
the
agreement
that's
alleged
is
uniform.
it
treats
everybody
the
same
way,
nobody
is
singled
out
and
ganged
up
against,
reinsurance
is
available,
it's
just
a
change
in
general
coverage
terms,
and
i
hope
i
can
convince
the
court
that
congress
meant
generically
agreements
relating
to
terms
and
coverage
to
be
grist
for
the
administrative
mill
and
not
for
the
antitrust
court.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
congress
believed
that
these
agreements
have
the
potential
to
rationalize
underwriting,
and
this
is
a
perfect
example,
because
there
was
a
tort
liability
crisis,
insolvencies
were
skyrocketing
in
the
insurance
industry
in
1984,
it
was
the
worst
year
in
history
for
the
commercial
general
liability
insurers,
and
when
they
respond
to
the
tort
liability
crisis
with
these
general
coverage
terms
that
don't
single
anyone
out
and
punish
anyone
or
discipline
anyone,
that
isn't
a
boycott.
what
congress
was
worried
about
when
it
prohibited
a
boycott
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
saw
in
south-east
underwriters,
where
there
were
trial-type
proceedings
and
people
were
expelled
from
the
industry.
they
couldn't
get
reinsurance
at
all.
they
were
singled
out
and
they
were
penalized
in
that
fashion,
and
that's
light
years
removed
from
a
general,
nondiscriminatory
agreement
changing
terms
and
coverage,
which
is
exactly
what
congress
meant
to
immunize,
and
i
think
this
court's
opinion
in
barry
recognizes
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
alleged
an
agreement
between
primaries
and
reinsurers
that
would
change
general
coverage
terms
in
these
forms
that
iso
had
submitted
to
the
states.
everybody
would--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--those
are...
but
these
forms,
by
the
way,
are
advisory
forms.
they're
not
binding
on
anybody.
they
preserve
all
the
options,
including
claims
made--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
barry
is
fundamentally
different.
in
barry,
the
boycotting
defendants
were
strangers
to
the
controversy.
they
singled
out
the
doctors,
and
they
treated
them
with
an
absolute
refusal
to
deal.
they
said,
we
will
not
give
you
any
kind
of
insurance
under
any
circumstances.
what
the
defendants
here
allege
to
have
done
is
to
insist
on
acceptable
coverage
terms
that
would
protect
everybody's
solvency
on
the
insurer
side
and
treat
everybody
identically
on
the
customer
side,
and
barry
says
that's
different.
that's
a
uniform
agreement
on
terms.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
isn't
alleged.
there's
no
attempt...
the
complaints
don't
say
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
don't
think
so.
the
complaints
don't
say
that
there
was
striking
out
at
particular
independent
primary
insurers.
what
they
say
is
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
change
general
coverage
terms
which
of
course
would
affect
everybody
in
the
same
way,
but
there
was
no
singling
out
or
targeting
or
striking
out
at
any
competitor,
which
was
what
was
going
on
in
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case.
it
was
focused
discipline
of
persons
who
violated
seua
rules.
they
were
kicked
out
of
the
industry
and
denied
any
reinsurance.
that's
light
years
removed
from
this
case.
i
wonder
if
the
court
would
allow
me
to
reserve
a
moment
for
rebuttal?
we
thank
the
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
critical
for
the
court
to
distinguish
the
seat
of
distinction
between
this
case
and
barry.
in
barry,
the
defendant
singled
out
one
group
of
doctors,
treated
them
differently
from
everybody
else
in
the
market.
they
penalized
them
by
a
complete
cut-off
of
insurance.
that's
so
different
from
this
case,
where
the
thing
that
is
alleged
is
a
general
change
in
insurance
coverage
that
applies
to
everybody
in
exactly
the
same
way,
and
in
the
barry
case
this
court
said
that
is
a
critical
distinction,
and
yet
our
friends
are
just
overriding
that
distinction
completely.
justice
scalia
put
his
finger
on
a
critical
idea
as
well.
that's
the
solvency
point.
one
theme
that
goes
throughout
this
legislative
history
is
that
if
a
consumer's
house
burns
down
and
he
can't
get
his
insurance
money
because
the
company
is
insolvent,
it
is
cold
comfort
to
tell
that
person
that
vigorous
sherman
act
competition
has
saved
him
5
percent
on
his
premiums.
congress
meant
these
agreements
on
terms
and
coverage
that
can
preserve
solvency
to
be
considered
by
specialized
insurance
regulators
who
can
weigh
these
sensitive
questions
of
public
policy
that
were
debated
a
few
moments
ago.
