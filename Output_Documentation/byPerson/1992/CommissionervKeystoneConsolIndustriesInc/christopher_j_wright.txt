mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
funding
rules
established
by
erisa,
keystone
consolidated
industries
owed
$9.6
million
to
the
pension
trust
it
sponsored
in
1983.
keystone
lost
$21
million
that
year
and
decided
not
to
pay
the
pension
trust
in
cash.
instead,
it
contributed
five
truck
terminals
to
fulfill
its
funding
obligation
to
the
pension
trust.
the
next
year
it
contributed
real
estate
to
partly
satisfy
its
funding
obligation
to
the
plan.
now,
keystone
recognized
that
these
transfers
of
property
were
sales
or
exchanges
for
purposes
of
the
income
tax
laws,
but
keystone
maintains
that
they
are
not
sales
or
exchanges
for
purposes
of
26
u.s.c.
4975(c)(1)(a).
subsection
(c)(1)(a),
the
provision
at
issue
in
this
case,
bars
any
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchange
between
an
employer
and
the
pension
plan
it
sponsors.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
the
trustee
could
have.
first--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--in
this
case,
the
trustee,
who
is
also
a
director
of
keystone
consolidated
industries,
accepted
the
property.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
there
might
also
be
a
fiduciary
duty
breach
action
in
a
case
of
this
sort.
in
fact,
many
such
breaches
were
alleged
and
found
by
the
district
court
in
some
related
litigation,
but
this
issue--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
issue
before
this
court,
did
not
focus
on
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
yes,
and
it's
probably
the
case
that
the
trustee
probably
should
have
refused
to
accept
this
property.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but
they
did
not.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
property
was
overvalued
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's
not
in
this
particular
case.
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
exactly,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
your
honor.
the
capital
gain...
keystone
acknowledged
that
this
is
a
sale
or
exchange
under
the
capital
gain
provision.
we
agree
with
that.
under
anyone's
interpretation,
the
tax
consequences
of
this
contribution
to
keystone
are
the
same
here.
if
i
may
return
to
your
earlier
point,
however,
one
of
the
key
things
i'd
like
to
make
clear
here
this
morning
is
that
subsection
(c)(1)(a)
and
the
other
prohibited
transaction
rules
are
phrased
categorically.
there
is
no
question
that
even
if
a
sale
is
for
fair
market
value
and
everyone
agrees,
the
language
of
the
statute
which
prohibits
any
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchange
between
an
employer
and
a
pension
plan
prohibits
that
transaction.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
oh.
i
think
congress
made
that
clear.
it
was
replacing
the
arm's-length
transaction
rule,
which
had
prevailed
prior
to
erisa,
with
this
categorical
rule
because
transactions
of
this
sort
are
inherently
susceptible
to
abuse.
you
have
already
suggested
one
of
the
ways
that
abuse
occurs
and,
in
fact,
did
occur
in
the
wood
case,
the
fourth
circuit
case
where
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
government
agrees
with.
in
that
case,
the
employer
intentionally
overvalued
the
property
it
contributed
to
its
plan.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
exactly,
your
honor.
what
the
irs
manual
said
was
that...
and
let
me
make
clear
that
this
is,
of
course,
an
in-house
manual
intended
for
auditors,
and
everyone
agrees
it
has
no
legal
binding
authority.
what
the
manual
said
was...
first,
it
had
a
sentence
that
said
that
if
the
terms
of
a
plan
allow,
a
pension
plan
may
accept
property.
it
then
had
an
example.
it
said,
for
instance,
a
profit
sharing
plan
may
accept
stock
from
the
employer.
now,
those--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--not
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
another
point
that
i
want
to
make
clear
today
is
that
there
is
a
big
difference
in
the
pension
area
between
defined
benefit
plans,
the
sort
of
plans
keystone
sponsored,
and
defined
contribution
plans
like
profit
sharing
plans,
the
plan
discussed
in
the
example
in
the
manual.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
we
would
take
the
position
that
if
a
defined
benefit
plan
allowed
contributions
of
property
to
fulfill
funding
obligations,
that
that
provision
of
the
plan
would
be
contrary
to
the
terms
of
erisa.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not,
but
the
example--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
anyone
went
through
the
irs
manual,
they
should
have
been
alerted
by
the
example
which
discussed
a
defined
contribution
plan,
and
they
should
have...
it
is
our
position
that
contributions
of
property
may
well
be
permissible
to
defined
contribution
plans.
those
plans
differ
from--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
a--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--exactly.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
a
defined
contribution
plan?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
frequently,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they
are
not
gratuitous
gifts
because
they're
deferred
compensation
to
the
employees,
but
as
far
as
the
plan
is
concerned,
they're
gratuitous
gifts.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor.
the
way
defined
contribution
plans
are
frequently
established
is
that
the
employer
basically
sets
up
individual
accounts
for
each
participant.
now,
the
plan
may
call
for...
it
may
call
for
no
contributions
at
all.
it
may
simply
set
up
a
mechanism
for
distributing
whatever
contributions
are
made.
it
may
also
call
for
a
percentage
of
profits
to
be
contributed
each
year.
but
these
plans
also
almost
always
allow
for
excess
contributions
if
the
employer
wants
to
contribute
more
than
it
has
promised,
if
in
fact
it
has
promised
anything.
those
sorts
of
contributions
are
not
required
by
any
contract
with
the
pension
plan
or
any
contract
at
all.
and
so--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--your
honor,
in
a
defined
contribution
plan,
there
is
no
future
year's
contribution.
section
412
of
title
26,
which
sets
out
the
minimum
funding
rules,
applies
only
to
defined
benefit
plans,
the
sorts
of
plans
keystone
sponsored.
it
has
no
bearing
on
individual
account
plans.
let
me
add
in
this
connection--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
would
be,
your
honor.
now,
i'm
told
that
in
many
of
these
plans,
what's...
if
something
is
mandated,
what's
mandated
is
a
percentage
of
profits
each
year.
so,
in
that
particular
situation,
presumably
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
credit
those
for
future
years.
but
let
me
say
in
this
connection
that
defined
contribution
plans
are
not
some
tail
wagging
the
dog
here.
they
actually
outnumber
defined
benefit
pension
plans
and
are
a
very
important
part
of
the
pension
scheme
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
if
keystone...
there's
an
additional
tax
if
keystone
doesn't
ultimately
correct
the
transaction.
it's
actually
a
100
percent
tax,
but
keystone
can
correct
the
transaction
even
after
it
loser
in
this
court.
so,
in
fact,
it's
very
unlikely
that
the
100
percent
tax
will
ever
get
levied.
there
could
be
a
fiduciary
breach
action,
as
i
think
i've
already
indicated,
against
the
fiduciary
alleging
that
it
should
not
have
accepted
the
property.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
certainly
could,
and
even
independent
of
that,
it
could
be
based
on
the
fact
that
the
fiduciary
simply
shouldn't
have
accepted
this
sort
of
property.
in
this
particular
case,
the
truck
terminals
were
quite
illiquid,
although
the...
i
think
the
reason
keystone
didn't
sell
them
and
contribute
the
proceeds,
which
is
what
the
government
thinks
an
employer
should
do,
is
because
it
was
trying
to
sell
them.
they
were
hard
to
sell.
in
fact,
the
pension
trust
tried
to
sell
them
immediately,
but
it
took
3
and
a
half
years
for
the
plan
to
sell
one
of
the
truck
terminals.
and,
of
course,
in
addition,
two
of
the
truck
terminals
were
subject
to
exclusive
listing
agreements
calling
for
the
payment
of
5
percent
sales
commission
to
brokers.
real
property
is
not
easy
to
sell.
and,
justice
blackmun,
i
was
trying
to
get
this
out
as
a
second
example
of
what
congress
was
clearly
concerned
about
in
this
area.
besides
the
more
easy
to
understand,
straight
abuse
of
overvaluing
the
property,
what
keystone,
in
effect,
did
here
was
find
a
buyer
for
its
truck
terminals
and
transfer
the
transaction
costs
of
sale
to
the
pension
trust
along
with
them.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
and
let
me
say
that
that's
a
harder
issue
that's
not
presented
in
this
case.
but
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
this
case...
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
concentrated
on
defined
benefit
plans,
and
we
said,
look
it,
this
is
an
easy
case.
the
contribution
here
fulfills
a
funding
obligation.
under
the
black
letter
law
for
50
years
in
the
tax
area,
it's
a
sale
or
exchange.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
well,
any
contribution
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
necessarily
satisfies
a
funding
contribution,
if
not
this
year,
next
year.
it
totally
overlooked
defined
contribution
plans.
now,
those
excess
contributions
are
admittedly
a
more
difficult
case
for
us.
they
do,
in
fact,
satisfy
in
effect
a
future
funding
obligation.
on
the
other
hand,
at
the
moment
the
contribution
is
made,
the
plan
does
not
actually
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
sue
for
the
truck
terminals.
now,
the
department
of
labor...
under
the
division
of
authority,
it's
the
department
of
labor
that
actually
has
the
primary
responsibility
among
the
three
agencies
that
administer
erisa
for
construing
this
provision.
and
it
has
issued...
in
1981,
that
is,
2
years
before
the
transactions
at
issue,
it
issued
an
opinion
letter
in
a
case
indistinguishable
from
this
one
in
all
respects
saying
that
the
contribution
of
property
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
to
satisfy
a
funding
obligation
is
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange.
in
1990,
it
issued
an
opinion
letter
discussing
a
voluntary
contribution
to
a
defined
contribution
plan
of
the
sort
i
have
talked,
a
contribution
that
fulfills
no
current
or
future
funding
obligation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
explained
that
the...
that
provision,
which
prohibits
any
contribution
of
mortgaged
property,
serves
the
following
role.
in
the
situation
at
issue
in
the
1990
transaction,
the
excess
contribution
to
a
defined
contribution
plan,
that
contribution
is
not
prohibited
by
subsection
(c)(1)(a),
but
subsection
(f)(3)
serves
the
additional
purpose
of
prohibiting
transfers
of
mortgaged
property
to
any
sort
of
pension
plan
under
any
circumstances.
and
that's
why,
contrary
to
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
our
interpretation
of
this
provision
does
not
render
(f)(3)
or
any
other
provision
superfluous.
it
prohibits
contributions
to
mortgaged
property...
of
mortgaged
property
under
any
circumstances.
so,
that's
the
role
it
played.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
and
let
me
say
that...
i
meant
to
say
in
response
to
your
earlier
question
that
as
between
the
formal
published
letter
of
the
department
of
labor,
which
is
intended
to
inform
people
how
the
agency
that
administers
the
prohibited
transaction
provision
interprets
it...
these
are
now
available
on
lexus
and
westlaw,
and
they
have
long
been
published
by
a
number
of
private
parties.
and
the
irs
manual,
an
in-house
manual
that
is
not
intended
to
inform
the
public...
it
is
surely
the
department
of
labor
opinion
letter
that
is
controlling
and
is
what
keystone
should--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--1981,
2
years
before
the
transfers
at
issue
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
has
a
deduction
because
it's
a
transfer
of
property.
sometimes
employers
argue
that
that
is
a
gift,
but
usually,
certainly
in
the
case
of
large
employers
like
keystone,
the
irs
almost
always
maintains
that,
in
fact,
what
happens
is
it's
a
transfer
of
property
between
the
employer
and
the
employees.
even
if
the
pension
plan
has
absolutely
no
right
to
the
money
and
no
right
to
insist
upon
it,
it's
nevertheless
a
form
of
deferred
compensation
to
the
employees,
and
it
is
deductible.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor.
in
some
certain
circumstances,
there
are
tax
consequences.
in
the
unusual
case
where
the
basis
in
the
property
is
actually
less
than
the
mortgage,
then
there
is
some
gain
to
the
transferor,
but
in
a
normal
case
where
the
property
is
worth
much
more
than
its
mortgage
and
the
basis
is
worth
more
than
the
mortgage,
that...
that's
simply
a
gift.
the
example
we've
used
is
that
if
a
father
gives
80,000...
property
worth
$80,000
to
a
child,
that's
a
gift.
if
the
parent
gives
a
$100,000
property
with
a
$20,000
mortgage
to
a
child,
we
think
that
it's
the
same.
the
same
result
holds
under
the
ordinary,
everyday
way
of
looking
at
the
transaction
which,
as
recently
as
the
solomon
case,
this
court
said
applies.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that's
a
further
response
to
keystone's
latest
argument
as
to
why
(f)(3)
is
rendered
superfluous
under
our
view
of
the
statute,
and
once
again,
it's
not
in
our
view...
any
old
contribution
of
mortgaged
property
is
not
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange,
but
it
is
prohibited
by
subsection
(f)(3).
let
me
say
that
subsection
(f)(3)
performs
a
rather
modest
role,
i'll
acknowledge,
under
our
view
of
the
statute,
but
that's
not
surprising.
congress
simply
wanted
not
to
allow
employers
to
use
one
particular
trick
of
mortgaging
property
to
raise
cash
and
then
transferring
the
property
to
the
pension
plan
to
have
to
pay
it
off.
let
me
add
that
i'm
more
than
willing
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
lot
of
overlap
in
erisa.
after
all,
there
are
two
prohibited
transaction
provision
added
by
erisa,
one
in
title
26
and
one
in
title
29,
both
of
which
prohibit
any
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchange
between
an
employer
and
a
pension
plan.
there
is
also
overlap
between
subsection
(c)(1)(a)
and
(f)(3).
a
contribution
of
mortgaged
property
to
fulfill
a
funding
obligation
would
be
prohibited
under
either
provision,
but
to
say
that
there
is
overlap
is
not
to
say
that
there's
superfluity.
and
let
me
say
that
the
essence
of
keystone's
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
they
first
acknowledge
that
sale
or
exchange
has
for
50
years
been
construed
very
expansively,
certainly
to
cover
the
situation
in
this
case.
in
fact,
no
court
has
ever
held
that
the
transfer
of
property
to
satisfy
an
indebtedness
is
not
a
sale
or
exchange.
then
they
acknowledge
that
erisa
is
drafted
very
expansively,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we...
on
reflection,
the
department
of
labor
had
issued
these
two
opinion
letters,
which
set
out
the
easier
cases.
and
then
the
hypothetical
you've
suggested,
which
is
a
contribution
of
property
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
in
excess
of
what's
owed
in
the
current
year,
the
fifth
circuit
said,
well,
look
it,
that
really
satisfies
a
funding
obligation
for
the
future,
and
therefore,
we
can't...
this
is
a
sale
or
exchange.
the
plan
is
giving
something
up.
it's
giving
something
up
in
the
future.
on
reflection,
the
department
of
labor
thinks
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
probably
right
in
that
respect.
let
me
add
that

of
its
brief
says
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
in
that
respect,
that
such
a
transaction
would
not
be
a
sale
or
exchange,
which
totally
undermines
its
argument
that
(f)(3)
is
superfluous.
under
that
view,
it's
not
superfluous
even
ignoring
defined
contribution
plans.
but
i
was
trying
to
say
that,
as
i
understand
the
essence
of
their
argument--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor.
a
contribution
to
a
defined
contribution
plan
in
excess
of
what's
owed
in
the
current
year
is
not
necessarily
a
sale
or
exchange.
a
contribution
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
probably
always
is,
although
that's
a...
that
question
isn't
actually
here
today.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's
a
sale
or
exchange.
it's
prohibited
by
subsection
(c)(1)(a).
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it's
not
prohibited
by
(c)(1)(a)--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--because
(c)(1)(a),
while
drafted
very
expansively,
any
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchange--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--right,
exactly.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
erisa
doesn't
prohibit
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
absolutely.
there
are
other
kinds
of
disqualified
persons,
fiduciaries,
accountants
and
lawyers
who
provide
services
to
that
plan.
now,
frankly,
it
is
usually
employers
who
contribute
property
to
pension
plans,
but
these
provisions
also
prohibit
other
employers...
other
parties
from
doing
that.
(f)(3)
actually
has
some
role
here.
there
has
been...
there
could
be
abuse
by
fiduciaries,
for
instance,
doing
the
same
trick,
mortgaging
property
to
raise
cash
and
giving
it
to
a
pension
plan
which
is
stuck
with
the
obligation
of
paying
it
off.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
well,
that's
true
too.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
say
in
that
respect
that,
unfortunately,
as
in
many
areas
of
erisa,
there
are,
of
course,
exceptions.
and,
in
fact,
subsection
(d)
sets
out
15
exceptions
to
the
prohibited
transaction
rules.
we
think
that's
significant,
first,
because
if
congress
wanted
to
allow
what
keystone
did,
it
would
have
allowed
an
exception.
now,
in
answer
to
your
question,
subsection
(d)(13)
allows
employers
to
contribute
certain
kinds
of
property,
certain
kinds
of
stock
and,
in
fact,
even
certain
kinds
of
real
property
in
specified
circumstances.
your
example
may
well
fall
into
that
situation,
but
let
me
note
in
this
respect
that
keystone's
situation
does
not
fall
into
exception
(d)(13)
where
congress
did
allow
contributions
of
property
to--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it
doesn't
speak
of
encumbered
property,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm
afraid
of
that.
but
let
me
make
one
last
point.
keystone
acknowledges
that
sale
or
exchange
has
a
very
broad
meaning
under
the
tax
laws.
it
acknowledges
that
erisa
is
written
expansively,
but
it
says
for
those
reasons,
subsection
(c)(1)(a)
should
be
construed
narrowly
to
minimize
the
overlap
between
(c)(1)(a)
and
(f)(3).
well,
in
our
view
that's
perverse
to
read
(c)(1)(a)
narrowly
because
congress
drafted
it
broadly.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
could.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
hadn't
thought
it
through
that
far,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
exceptions
could
apply
there.
let
me
add
also,
to
make
it
even
more
complicated,
that
there's
yet
another...
there's
a
general
exemption
provision
in
(c)(2).
an
employer
like
keystone
suffering
from
financial
problems
can
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
say,
"we're
in
hard
shape.
"
"we
want
to
contribute
property.
"
"it's
not
going
to
harm
the
plan
for
the
following
reasons.
"
and
the
secretary
of
labor
can
authorize
it.
i
believe
the
secretary
of
labor
could
authorize
a
contribution
of
mortgaged
property.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but,
of
course,
again
keystone
bypassed
the
statute,
and
it's
asking
this
court
to
authorize
it
and
other
employers
to
do
so
in
the
future.
thank
you.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
wexler
acknowledged
that
sale
or
exchange
has
for
50
years
been
construed
by
the
courts
to
include
a
transfer
of
property
to
satisfy
an
indebtedness.
in
subsection
(c)(1)(a),
congress
didn't
merely
prohibit
sales
or
exchanges.
it
prohibited
any
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchanges.
whatever
hard
cases
there
are
in
the
future,
a
transfer
of
property
in
fulfillment
of
a
funding
obligation
is
certainly
a
form
of
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchange.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
it
fulfills
a
current...
if
it
fulfills
a
funding
obligation
to
the
defined
contribution
plan,
it
is.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
not
superfluous
because
there
are
contributions
made
to
defined
contribution
plans
that
do
not
fulfill
any
current
or
future
funding
obligation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
those
are
certainly
also
prohibited,
but
sale
or
exchange
is
a
phrase
that's
used
throughout
title
26.
it
has
a
well-settled
meaning.
it
had
a
well-settled
meaning
in
1974.
we
think
that
congress
relied
on
that
meaning
when
it
used
that
language.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
your
honor,
sale
or
exchange
has
a
settled
meaning,
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
fair
to
characterize
it
as
technical.
as
professor
bittker
explains
in
his
treatise,
transferring
property
to
satisfy
a
debt
is
just
the
same
as
selling
the
property
and
saying,
oh,
by
the
way,
instead
of
giving
me
cash,
please
credit
my
accumulated
funding
account,
which
admittedly
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
satisfied
in
cash.
but
i
wonder
what
would
have
happened
if
keystone
had
tried
to
give
this
property
to
one
of
its
other
creditors
that
it
owed
obligations
to.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
employers
make
large
payments
to
pension
plans,
not
all
of
which
actually
go
into
the
plans
to
pay
pension
accounts.
they
also
agree
to
pay
certain
administrative
money.
so,
when
an
employer
makes
a
payment
to
a
pension
plan,
all
the
money
doesn't
necessarily
go
into
the
plan.
some
of
it
goes
elsewhere.
and
let
me
also
say
with
respect
to
412--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
amount
considered
contributed
to
the
plan.
well,
you
know,
the
other
thing
about
section
412
is
that
we're
faulted,
on
the
one
hand,
that
there
are
so
many
prohibitions
on
this
kind
of
transaction,
that
there's
a
danger
of
superfluousness.
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
in
certain
other
provisions
of
the
in
tax...
income
tax
code,
it
doesn't
make
clear
that
these
transactions
are
prohibited.
well,
that's
found
to
be
significant
too.
we
think
two
prohibited
transaction
provisions
saying
that
any
direct
or
indirect
sale
or
exchange
is
prohibited
is
arguably
more
than
enough.
it's
certainly
enough.
