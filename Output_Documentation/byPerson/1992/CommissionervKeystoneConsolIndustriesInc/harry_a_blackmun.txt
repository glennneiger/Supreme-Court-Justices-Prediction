justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--all
right.
mr.
wright,
i
take
it
there's
no
question
of
the
valuation
of
these
properties.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
that
possibility
of
abuse
is
not
in
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
you
would
prefer
or
congress
would
prefer,
according
to
your
theory,
that
the
properties
be
sold
first
and
the
proceeds
contributed
to
the--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--any
why
is
that?
to
put
the
capital
gain,
if
there
is
such,

the
taxpayer
rather
than
on
the--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
why
would
the
congress
so
provide.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
was
either
this
case
or
the
wood
case
in
the
tax
court
reviewed
by
the
full
court?
