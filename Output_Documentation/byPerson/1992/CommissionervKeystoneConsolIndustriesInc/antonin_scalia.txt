justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
mr.
wright?
because
there's
no
sale
or
exchange?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
contract
can
provide,
i
mean,
whether
the
statute
provides
it
or
not.
the
contract
can
provide
for
future
year
payments.
let's
assume
one
that
says
you
shall
make
this
much
of
a
contribution
every
year,
and
you
may,
in
addition,
make
whatever
beyond
that
you
wish.
so,
in
year
one,
the
employer
makes
the
minimum
plus
a
lot.
i
think
the
question
asked
is
whether
that
excess
can
be
credited
to
the
next
year's.
that
would
be
entirely
up
to
the
terms
of
the
contract,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
what
if
it
is
not
in
excess
of
what
is
owed,
but
is...
it's
a
contribution
to
a
defined
contribution
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
obligation
is
only
an
obligation
to
the
employee,
not
to
the
plan?
is
that
not
a
defined
contribution
plan
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
employer
makes
a
deal
with
his
employees.
i
will...
you
know,
i
will
contribute
a
certain
percentage
of
profits
every
year
to
this
plan.
he
makes
a
deal
with
his
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
to...
but
to
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
would
be
a
sale
or
exchange
with
the
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
telling
me
more
about
this
than
i
want
to
know,
mr.
wright.
you
really
are.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wexler,
the
consequence
of
the
argument
you're
now
making,
however,
is
not
that
the
section
should
be
interpreted
the
way
you
want
to
interpret
it.
we
would
interpret
it,
the
way
the
government
wants
it,
to
make
this
a
prohibited
transaction,
but
you
just
wouldn't
have
to
pay
the
5
percent
penalty.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
prohibited
transaction,
and
you
would
have
to
undo
it.
i
mean,
that's
no
justification
for
interpreting
the
statute
the
wrong
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
consequence
is
you
don't
owe
the
tax,
but
in
addition
to
that,
should
we
make
nonprohibited
what
are
prohibited
transactions
just
because
they
haven't
been
made
prohibited
clearly
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
need
that
for
that
purpose.
they
have
defined
contribution
plans
instead
of
defined
benefit
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
suffice?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
carry
a
lot
of
weight
with
me,
but
it
does
eliminate
your
argument
that
they...
i
agree
that
there's
some
difficulty
in
figuring
out
what
happens
to
the
four
extra
parts.
but
however
that
argument
comes
out,
even
if
you
disagree
entirely
with
the
government
on
that
and
say
that
all
five
parts
are
considered
sales
and
exchanges,
there's
still
an
explanation
for
(f)(3).
justice
antonin
scalia
sales
or
exchanges
to
whom?
i
mean,
the
point...
they're
not
claiming
that
they're
not
sales
and
exchanges.
they're
just
claiming
that
they
are
not
sales
and
exchanges
to
the
plan,
which
is
the
only
prohibited
sale
or
exchange.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
tax
cases
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
into
to
whom
it
is
because
it's
irrelevant
for
taxation,
but
you
have
to
make
the
decision
for
purposes
of
erisa.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
agree
with
what
you
just
said
if
the
mortgage
is
in
a
lesser
amount
than
the
equity
in
the
property.
i
just
don't
agree
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--say,
mr.
wright,
the
language,
sale
or
exchange
or
leasing,
the
words
leasing
coming
after
sale
or
exchange,
does
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
they're
talking
about
a
person-to-person
transaction,
not
just
the
regular
contribution
that
the
employer
makes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
strange
to
use
that
highly
technical
meaning
which
would
cover
any
contribution
to
the
plan
which
elsewhere
is
referred
to
as
contributions
in
the
statute.
