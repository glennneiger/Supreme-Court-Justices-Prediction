mr.
wright,
can
i
just
get
one
question
out
of
the
way
early?
would
the
trustee
of
the
fund
have
been
empowered
to
refuse
to
accept
that
kind
of
payment
and
insisted
on
cash?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
this
was
acceptable
to
the
trust
to
accept
the
assets
in
this
form.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mentioned
the
director.
is
there
any
claim
that
the...
i
mean,
does
that
make
a
difference
in
the
legal
issue
whether
the
director
is
one
who
might
not
be
totally
independent
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
the
purpose
of
the
legal
issue
we
have,
is
it
correct
that
we
should
assume,
a,
that
the
trustee
has...
is
an
independent
person
and,
b,
has
the
authority
to
refuse
to
take
anything
except
cash?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
we
shouldn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
there
are
multiple
terminals
here.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
supposing
the
funding
obligation
was
$100,000
and
they
had
five
terminals,
each
worth
$100,000
fair
market
value,
and
they
transferred
all
five
of
them.
would
the
four
that
were
not
necessary
to
discharge
the
obligation
also
be
sales
or
exchanges
within
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
completed
your
explanation
to
me
why
the
portion
of
the...
say,
an
excess
is
involved...
why
that's
a
sale
or
exchange?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
you
really
did
complete
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it's
superfluous
if
you
take
your
view
of
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
superfluous
if
you
take
your
view
of
the
transaction
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
assume
a
plan
invests
all
its
money
in
government
bonds,
and
the
employer
has
an
excess
of
government
bonds
and
rather
than
selling
them,
he
wants
to
transfer
those.
that
would
also
be
prohibited,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
(d)(13),
which
is
not
set
out
in
the
brief,
have...
apply
to
transfers
of
encumbered
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
there
is
still
a
flat
rule
against
encumbered
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
be
sure
of
one
thing
in
my
mind?
is
it
your
position
that
a
transfer
of
property,
real
property,
to
a
defined
contribution
plan
is
also
a
sale
or
exchange?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
isn't
(c)(3),
or
whatever
the
number
is,
superfluous?
