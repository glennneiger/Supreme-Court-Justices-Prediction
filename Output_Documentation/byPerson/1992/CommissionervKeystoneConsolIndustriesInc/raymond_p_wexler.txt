mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin.
i
think
i'd
like
to
begin
with
where
mr.
wright
began
which
has
some
implication
in
answer
to
a
question
that
there
was
an
allegation
of
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
on
the
trustee's
behalf
for
having
accepted
this
property.
that's
simply
untrue.
the
answer
to
the
question
is
the
trustee
could
have
and
it
was...
within
his
duty
as
a
fiduciary
could
have
rejected
this
property
if
he
thought
it
was
an
inappropriate
contribution.
second,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
mr.
wright's
comments
to
justice
o'connor
regarding
the
irs
manual
and
his
statements
regarding
the
department
of
labor
advisory
opinion.
when
erisa
was
passed
in
1974,
there
were
three
agencies
involved
in
the
enforcement
and
regulation
of
erisa:
the
department
of
labor,
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
the
pbgca...
the
pbgc.
sorry.
the...
originally
the
irs
was
given
regulatory
authority
under
4975,
the
section
at
issue
here.
it
was
also
given
regulatory
authority
under
section
412,
which
is
the
section
that
places
the
obligation
on
an
employer
with
respect
to
a
defined
benefit
plan.
in
1978,
pursuant
to
reorg
plan
4,
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs,
the
irs
and
the
department
of
labor
divided
up
responsibility
for
various
portions
of
erisa.
under
that
division
of
authority,
the
department
of
labor
was
given
regulatory
authority
under
4975,
certain
portions
of
it,
including
the
two
that
are
relevant
here,
(c)(1)(a)
and
(f)(3).
the
irs
retained
regulatory
authority
under
section
412,
the
obligation
setting
section.
with
that
background
in
mind,
let's
talk
about
what
the
three
agencies
have
done.
the
department
of
labor
has
never
issued
regulations
under
4975(c)(1)(a)
or
(f)(3)
indicating
that
noncash
contributions
to
defined
benefit
plans
were
intended
to
be
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
yes.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
the
sole
position
administratively
of
the
department
of
labor
is
the
two
private
advisory
opinions,
one
issued
in
1981,
3
years
before,
approximately,
these
transactions
occurred,
one
issued
in
1990,
2
weeks
after
my
client
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
tax--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--for
two
reasons.
one,
under
the
department's
own
procedures,
private
parties
are
not
entitled
to
rely
upon
opinions.
only
the
parties
in
the
opinion
are
entitled
to
rely
on
them.
so,
in
a
sense,
what
the
irs
is
stating
is
that
this
taxpayer
ought
to
be
bound
by
an
advisory
opinion,
with
respect
to
which,
under
the
department's
own
rules,
this
taxpayer
could
not
rely
upon.
second,
and
perhaps
more
important,
the
department
of
labor
'81
advisory
opinion
contains
within
it
a
false
assumption,
and
that
assumption
is
that
code
section
412
imposes
a
cash
obligation
upon
the
taxpayer.
the
way
that
advisory
opinion
analyzes
the
issue,
it
states
that
the
transfer
of
property
to
a
plan
that
has
a
legal
right
to
receive
cash
is
tantamount
to
a
sale.
whether
or
not
there
is
a
cash
obligation
is
answered
by
code
section
412.
that
is
the
code
section
that
the
irs,
not
the
department
of
labor,
has
regulatory
power
over.
and
that
would
lead
you
then
to
ask
what
is
the
irs'
administrative
position.
like
the
department
of
labor,
the
irs
has
issued
no
regulations
whatsoever
indicating
that
a
transfer
of
noncash
property
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
is
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange.
however,
the
irs
has
not
been
silent.
first,
in
1978,
a
taxpayer
in
a
private
letter
ruling
asked
the
irs
to
rule
on
this
issue.
the
irs
stated
that
it
was
an
issue
that
could
not
be
reasonably
resolved
without
the
issuance
of
regulations.
what
the
irs
is
really
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
issue
the
regulations
that
they
have
not--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--i
would
so
argue,
but
i'm
really
making
an
argument--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--no.
i'm
really
making
an
argument
that
the
department
of
labor
1981
advisory
opinion
is
not
the
type
of
administrative
agency
position
that
courts
tend
to
offer
deference
to.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
an
opinion
that
is
wrong,
that
is
a
private
opinion.
we
have
the
irs,
through
its
manual,
telling
agents
that
the
rules
are
exactly
the
opposite,
and
we
have
the
pbgc,
which
really
had
no
administrative
position
at
all.
they
have
had
nothing
to
say
on
this
issue
at
all
until
they
filed
the
amicus
brief
in
this
court.
the
cases
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
that
would
indicate
that
courts
ought
to
pay
deference
to
the
administrative
position
of
agencies
all
either
involve
published
regulations
or
published
rulings,
and
in
none
of
those
cases
does
it
involve
issues
on
which
there
are
differences
of
opinion
between
the
various
agencies
involved.
i
would,
however,
to
continue
to
respond
to
your
question,
state
that
we
have
a
disagreement
with
mr.
wright...
a
terrible
name
for
an
opponent
to
have,
mr.
wright--
[laughter]
--a
disagreement
with
the
government
on
whether
or
not
the
excise
tax
of
4975
is
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
law
is
that
people
are
not...
people
or
corporations
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
penalties
unless
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
impose
those
penalties.
i
think
underlying
those
cases
is
the
notice
issue
that
you
indicate.
we
would
submit
that
it
is
crystal
clear
in
our
mind
that
4975
does,
indeed,
impose
a
penalty.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
yes.
it
is
a
5
percent
per
year
penalty
in
addition
to
a
100
percent
penalty
if
the
transaction
is
not
corrected.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
because
it...
because
of
the
magnitude
and
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
prohibit
conduct
by
providing
pecuniary
punishment,
and
a
tax
that
has
that
purpose
is
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty,
not
in
the
nature
of
a
tax.
in
the
acker
court...
case,
which
is
the
leading
case
in
this
area--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--the
acker,
acker.
this
court
held...
the
question
was
whether
the
additions
to
tax
for
failure
to
file
estimated
tax
returns,
as
well
as
for
failing
to
pay
estimated
taxes...
whether
those
taxes
were
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty.
and
what
this
court
held...
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
footnote
4
in
the
main
opinion
and
the
single
footnote
in
the
dissenting
opinion...
concluded
that
those
taxes
were
in
the
nature
of
a
prohibition
for
violation
of
a
statutory
order.
the
same,
exact
thing
is
true
of
the
4975
tax.
that
is
a
pecuniary
punishment.
in
this
case,
the
assessed
tax
is
$13
million.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
it
is
5
percent
for
a
number
of
years,
plus
100
percent.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
correct.
the
maximum
criminal
penalty
provided
in
erisa
for
knowing
violation
of
erisa
provisions
is
only
$100,000,
so
that
the
tax
which
we
are
describing
as
being
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty
is
more
than
100
times
greater
than
the
maximum
criminal
penalty
provided--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--keystone
has
made
an
effort
to
determine.
the
problem
is
that
the
issue
of
correction
also
is
an
irs
issue,
not
a
department
of
labor.
the
irs
regulations
are
not
written
in
contemplation
that
a
contribution
of
property
would
be
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange.
therefore,
they
don't
have
any
provisions
that
would
tell
us
how
to
correct.
but
i
promise
you,
we
did
try
to
find
out
what
the
irs
thought
we
ought
to
do
in
order
to
correct,
and
we
had
no
response.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
one
could
reasonably
conclude--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--no,
no,
no,
but
i
think
that
if
the
statute
is
penal
in
nature,
then
it
is
a
statute
that
ought
not
assess
a
tax
unless
it
is
fairly
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
the
tax
is
owed.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
let
me
talk
then
about
why
we
believe
that
they
are
not
prohibited
transactions.
justice
stevens
asked
a
question
which
i
believe
mr.
wright
has
answered
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
government's
position
both
in
its
brief
here
and
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
asked
was
whether
in
a
defined
benefit
plan,
if
a
year's
minimum
funding
requirement
was
$100,000
and
the
taxpayer
contributed
property,
five
separate
parcels
that
were
each
equal
to
$100,000,
which
parts
of
those
would
be
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange
and
which
would
not.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
first
piece,
the
first
$100,000
worth
would
be
a
prohibited
transaction.
however,
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
other
four
pieces
would
not
be
prohibited
transactions.
and
even
though
for
income
tax
purposes,
all
five
of
those
are
treated
as
sales
or
exchanges
for
income
tax
purposes
and
in
each
of
the
five
cases,
the
taxpayer
would
have
to
pay
a
capital
gain
on
his
income
tax
return,
just
as...
the
way
keystone
did.
the
problem
with
the...
the
reason
the
government
reaches
this
position
is
exactly
because
of
the
existence
of
(f)(3).
(f)(3)
states
that
a
transfer
of
property
subject
to
a
mortgage
will
be
treated...
shall
be
treated
i
believe
the
words
are...
as
a
sale
or
exchange.
the
necessary
implication
on
the
face
of
the
statute
is
that
if
it
is
not,
it
is
not
intended
to
be
a
sale
or
exchange.
thus,
the
government
is
looking
for
some
meaning
for
(f)(3)
that
is
consistent
with
a
transfer
of
noncash
property
being
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange
when
it
is
an
exchange
for
a
minimum
funding.
and
the
distinction
that
you
have
drawn
is
exactly
where
they
draw
the
line.
what
says
the
government
is
that
the
first
piece
is
an
exchange
for
a
cash
obligation,
the
minimum
standard
requirement
for
that
year.
therefore,
that's
a
sale
or
exchange.
however,
the
other
four
pieces
are
not
for
that
year's
cash
obligation.
therefore,
those
are
not
prohibited
sales
or
exchanges
under
(c)(1)(a),
and
that
is
the
slice
that
(f)(3)
was
intended
to
pick
up.
we
would
submit
two
answers
to
this.
one,
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
without
a
single
word
in
the
legislative
history
speaking
of
this
differentiation
about
the
two
types
of
contribution
under
code
section
412.
moreover,
we
would
suggest
that
code
section
412
does
not
impose
a
cash
obligation
on
the
taxpayer.
what
the
words
of
412
state
specifically
is
that
the
employer
must
satisfy
a
minimum
funding
standard,
and
that
is
specifically
defined
by
412(a)
with
the
following
language:
a
plan...
and
i
will
quote...
shall
have
satisfied
the
minimum
funding
standard
for
such
year
for
a
plan
year
if
at
the
end
of
such
plan
year
the
plan
does
not
have
an
accumulated
funding
deficiency.
then
in
412(b)
the
code
states
how
you
determine
whether
there
is
an
accumulated
funding
deficiency.
one
of
the
things
that
happens
in
making
this
determination
is
there
are
credits
provided
to
and
charges
against
the
plan's
assets.
one
of
the
credits
is
for
the
amount
contributed
by
the
employer.
what
the
irs
alleges...
and
i
would
point
out
to
page
5
in
their
brief...
is
that
the
allowance...
or
the
statement
in
412(b)
that
provides
a
credit
for
the
amount...
and
the
irs
puts
the
words
amount
in
quotes...
of
contribution
by
the
employer,
that
is
the
item
that
provides
the
monetary
obligation
or
the
dollar
obligation.
that
is
the
beginning
point
of
their
substantive
argument.
what
the
irs
fails
to
point
out
and
totally
ignores
are
the
two
words
immediately
following
the
word
amount,
which
they
put
in
quote,
and
those
amounts...
those
words
are
the
amounts
considered
contributed.
we
would
submit
that
the
irs
is
absolutely
incorrect.
the
two
words
i
have
just
added,
which
are
in
the
code,
make
it
clear
that
congress
must
have
thought
that
something
other
than
cash
was
going
to
be
contributed
in
discharge
of
the
minimum
funding
standard,
otherwise
the
words
amount
considered
contributed
would
have
no
meaning.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
(b).
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
(b)(3)
i
believe.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
412(a)...
it
doesn't.
412(a)--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--it
is
not
set
out
in
our
brief.
it
is
discussed
in
the
government's
reply
brief
that
was
filed
in
response
to
our
argument
that
there
was
no
cash
obligation.
they
then
quote
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
5
portions
of
(b)(3).
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
my
colleague
advises
me
on
pages
7
and
8
of
our
main
brief.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
yes,
our
only
brief.
the
point
being
is
that
if
412...
if
i
can
try
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy's...
or
justice
stevens'
question
a
little
more.
a
defined
benefit
plan
requires
an
employer
to
fund
benefits
over
the
life
of
the
employee
such
that
when
the
employee
retires,
there
is
sufficient
assets
in
the
plan
in
order
to
pay
retirement
benefits.
the
irs'
argument
that
attempts
to
distinguish
between
what
they
call
voluntary
contributions,
which
are
the
four
additional
pieces
of
your
five
$100,000
pieces
and
the
initial
$100,000,
draws
an
economic
distinction
that
doesn't
make
any
sense,
and
the
reason
is
both
contributions
are
in
discharge
of
the
employer's
obligation:
one,
the
minimum
obligation
for
the
year;
the
other,
the
overall
obligation,
which
is
the
employer's
full
obligation
to
fund
the
plan.
the
question...
the
difference
is
one
of
timing,
not
of
economic
substance.
the
reason
the
irs
is
forced
to
draw
this
distinction,
which,
as
i
pointed
out,
is
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
legislative
history,
is
because
of
the
existence
of
(f)(3).
they
need
to
find
some
contribution
that
is
a
prohibited
sale
or
exchange
under
(c)(1)(a),
but
does
not
render
(f)(3)
totally
meaningless.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
except
for
the
fact
that--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--there
was
no
indication...
there's
not
a
single
word...
and
i
mean
a
single
word...
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicated
that
(c)(1)(a)
was
intended
to
apply
different
rules
to
defined
benefit
as
opposed
to
defined--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--but
it
is
a
strained
explanation.
plus,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
intellectual
underpinning
of
their
initial
argument.
the
way
they
get
any
of
these
transactions
to
be
prohibited
sales
or
exchange
is
by
application
of
income
tax
cases.
and
it
is
true
that
in
income
tax
cases,
these
are
treated
as
sales
or
exchanges.
the
problem
is
if
congress
had
in
mind
income
tax
consequences
in
(c)(1)(a),
the
very
same
income
tax
cases
that
hold
that
mandatory
contributions
are
sales
or
exchange
also
hold
that
voluntary
contributions
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
are
sales
or
exchange
and
also
hold
that
contributions--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--in
order
to
reach
that
argument,
they
have
concluded
that
there
is
an
underpinning
in
the
income
tax
sales
or
exchange
cases
that
looks
at
to
whom
the
sale
or
exchange
is
between.
it
seems
to
us
there
are
two
real
problems
with
that.
problem
one
is
none
of
those
cases
talk
at
all
about
who
the
sale
or
exchange
is
between.
what
those
cases
do
is
they
conclude
that
the
transferor
has
recognized
the
benefit
of
economic
gain
and,
therefore,
should
pay
an
income
tax.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
moreover--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--however,
if
a
mortgage...
if
a
property
is
transferred
to
a
pension
plan
subject
to
a
mortgage,
it
is
crystal
clear
who
that
sale
or
exchange
is
between.
that
sale
or
exchange
is
between
the
party
who
is
being
relieved
of
the
liability,
by
analogy
the
employer
in
our
case,
and
the
party
assuming
the
liability,
namely
the
plan.
therefore,
if
that
were
the
concept
that
congress
had
in
mind,
(f)(3)
has
defined
the
single
transaction
that
is
clearly
between
the
plan
and
the
employer,
not
between
the
employer
and
the
employees.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
the...
when
a
mortgage
is
assumed,
the
party
assuming
it
pays
the
liability.
so,
in
a
sense
it
is
no
different
than
if
a
liability,
absent
property,
were
transferred
to
a
plan.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
whether
or
not
a
sale
or
exchange,
when
mortgaged
property
is
transferred
to
a
plan,
is
between
the
plan
and
the
employer
or
the
employer
and
the
employee,
it
would
seem
to
us
to
indicate
the
clearest
example
where
you
have
a
transaction
that
4975
is
trying
to
operate
on,
the
reason
being
that
4975,
by
and
large,
is
talking
about
transactions
from
which
assets
that
are
in
a
trust
are
extracted
from
that
trust.
it's
not
a
funding
section.
the
reason
that
they
have
made
the
mortgaged
property
into
a
sale
or
exchange
is
because
that
is
a
transaction
that
can
occur
in
a
funding
context,
but
which
results
in
the
extraction
of
assets
from
the
plan.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
no.
what
our
position
is
is
that
the
income
tax
cases
that
hold
that
transfers
to
defined
benefit,
to
defined
contribution,
voluntary,
mandatory,
that
contributions
of
that
nature
of
property
to
a
plan
are
sales
or
exchanges,
was
affirmatively
not
intended
to
be
included
in
(c)(1).
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
exactly.
that's
exactly,
precisely
the
issue.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
correct,
because
that
is
prohibited
under
a
different
section.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
correct.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
correct.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
right.
the
same
with...
i
mean,
i'll
give
you
an...
the
same
with
the
prohibition
under
(a)(2)(b),
the
very
next
subsection.
the
very
next
subsection
in
4975(c)
is
called
(a)(1)(b)
instead
of
(c),
and
what
that
provides
is
a
prohibition
against
the
lending
of
money
back
and
forth
between
a
plan
and
an
employer.
what
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
stated
was
that
one
of
its
purposes
was
to
disallow
an
employer
from
funding
his
obligations
with
a
promissory
note,
the
reason
being
a
promissory
note
would
then
create
the
prohibited
lending.
we
would
submit
that
that
sentence
is
also,
just
like
(f)(3),
irreconcilable
with
the
theory
that
congress
intended
in
(c)(1)(a)
to
include
to
prohibit
noncash
contributions,
the
reason
being
a
promissory
note
is
clearly
a
noncash
contribution.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
correct,
or
transferring
mortgaged
property
would
not
be
permitted.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
that
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
for
consideration
i
would
assume.
that's
why
i
started
out
talking
about
412.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
is
not
intended
to
be.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
and
the
reason
is
is
that
412
does
not
impose
a
cash
obligation.
i
would
suggest
that
if
412
had
a
rule
that
said
that
all
contributions
to
a
defined
benefit
plan
must
be
made
in
real
estate,
we
would
not
be
here
because
we
would
have
a
clear
allowance
of
what
we
want.
i
would
also
state
that
if
412
had
a
rule
that
said
all
contributions
must
be
made
in
cash,
we
would
not
be
here
either,
and
the
reason
is
we
wouldn't
have
a
case
because
in
discharge
for
cash,
it's
clearly
a
sale.
the
problem
is
412
is
intended
to
provide
flexibility
on
funding
to
plan
employers.
mr.
wright
indicated
that
there
are,
by
and
large,
way
more
defined
contribution
plans
than
defined
benefit
plans.
i
would
suggest
that
the
congressional
policy
is
to
favor
defined
benefit
plans,
the
reason
being
they
are
the
only
kind
of
plans
that...
where
the
investment
risk
of
the
assets
rests
with
the
employer,
not
the
employee.
as
pointed
out
in
professor
zelinsky's
article,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
one
could
argue
that,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
congress
would
not
be
interested
in
passing
anything
that
would
restrict
funding
of
defined
benefit
plans
because
it
would
tend
to
discourage
those
plans
when
policy
is
exactly
the
opposite.
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
i
can't
answer
that
question,
but
i
would
suggest
that
transferring
the
terminals
to
the
plan
is
more
like
not
selling
them
than
it
is
like
selling
it.
once
they
were
transferred,
it
was
up
to
the
fiduciary
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
good
investment
or
a
bad
investment,
a
short-term
investment
or
a
long-term
investment.
the
real
estate
that
was
contributed
in
the
second
year
was
sold
at
a
gain
by
the
trustee
within
the
year
it
was
contributed.
the
truck
terminals
were
held.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
in
order
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
decisions
entered
in
this
matter
by
the
tax
court
and
the
fifth
circuit,
this
court
will
have
to
find
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
government's
favor
on
three
conceptual
issues.
first,
this
government...
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
412,
we
think,
imposes
a
cash
obligation.
second,
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
when
congress
passed
(c)(1)(a),
they
intended
to
implant
income
tax
consequences
with
respect
to
certain
contributions,
but
specifically
intended
to
ignore
income
tax
consequences
with
respect
to
other
transactions.
the
reason
is
that
we
think
if
you
don't
do
that,
you
have
read
(f)(3)
out
of
the
law.
and
item
three,
this
court
would
have
to
conclude,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
section
4975
does
not
impose
a
tax
that
is
in
the
nature
of
penalty.
it
is--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--because
if
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
penalty,
this
court's
precedents
would
indicate
it
has
to
be
narrowly
construed.
we
would
suggest
that
that's
a
standard--
mr.
raymond
p.
wexler
--you
would
have
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
i
would
agree
with
you
actually.
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion,
which
i
think
is
a
wrong
conclusion
because
i
think
the
words
of
the
statute
don't
say
that.
but
if
you
came
to
that
conclusion,
you
could
then
defer
and
not
deal
with
the
penalty
issue.
it
is,
nevertheless,
our
position
that
it
would
be
incorrect,
as
a
matter
of
law,
for
this
court
to
find
in
favor
of
the
irs
on
any
of
these
three
issues,
much
less
all
three.
we
would
submit
that
if
the
department
of
labor
and
the
internal
revenue
service
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
noncash
contributions
should
not
be
made
to
defined
benefit
plans
or
that
some
should
and
some
should
not,
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
an
issue
that
ought
to
be
addressed
to
congress,
not
to
this
court.
thank
you.
