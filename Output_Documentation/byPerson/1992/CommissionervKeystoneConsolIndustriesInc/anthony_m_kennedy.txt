mr.
wright--
--in
the
case
where
an
excess
amount
of
property
is
contributed,
an
amount
of
property
over
and
above
the
employer's
obligation,
does
the
employer
have
a
deduction
for
that
additional
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
other
question.
in
tax
law
generally,
quite
apart
from
the
pension
benefit
plan,
if
i
simply
make
a
gift
to
someone...
i
give
a
car
to
my
son...
that's
not
a
sale
or
exchange,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there's
a
mortgage
on
the
property
that
he
assumes.
is
that
then
become
a
sale
or
exchange?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that's
a
further
argument
on
your
behalf
of
why
(f)(3)
is
necessary
in
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
wright,
what's
your
response
to
the
argument
that
412(b)(3)
does
say
that
the
funding
standard
shall
be
credited
with
the
sum
of
the
amount
considered
contributed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
simple
bookkeeping
entry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
amount
contributed...
it's
either
contributed
or
it
isn't.
