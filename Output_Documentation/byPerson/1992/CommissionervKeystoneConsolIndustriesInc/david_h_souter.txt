there
is
no
sale
or
exchange
because
there's
no
obligation

contribute.
justice
david
h.

isn't
there
an
obligation
to
contribute
some
way
or
other
than
in
the
plan,
i.e.,
the
trust
instrument
itself?
justice

they're
just
making
gratuitous
gifts--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
they're
deferred
compensation
because
they're
obligated
under
some
contract--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
it
characteristic
in
those
cases
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
plan
for
crediting
any
excess
contributions
to...
let's
say,
to
a
future
year's
obligation,
if
there
would
be
an
obligation?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wright,
in
giving
examples
of
transfers
that
were...
would
not
be
in
satisfaction
of
an
existing
obligation
to
the
plan,
i
think
all
of
your
examples
are
of
transfers
by
the
employer.
could
there
be
transfers
by
other
disqualified
persons?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
unions?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wright,
i
don't
want
to
spoil
your
hopes
in
that
respect,
but--
[laughter]
you've
just
tantalized
me
with
one
possibility
here.
is
it
possible
that
the
flat
prohibition
on
transfers
of
encumbered
property
could
have
been
put
in
there
to
trump
one
of
the
exceptions?
