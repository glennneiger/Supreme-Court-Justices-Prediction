mr.
wright,
i
take
it
that
the
irs
manual
until
1989
indicated
that
a
transfer
such
as
this
was
allowable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
terms
of
this
plan
allow
the
transfer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
there
anything
in
this
plan
that
addressed
the
subject
of
the
nature
of
the
annual
contribution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
manual
didn't
really
refer
to
that
distinction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so,
if
anyone...
if
any
taxpayer
were
looking
at
the
irs'
own
manual,
they
would
have
thought
that
if
the
pension
accepted
this
property,
it
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
wright,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
dol
opinion
letter
is
a
formal
interpretation
of
section
4975?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
when
did
that
opinion
letter
issue
again?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
issue
an
opinion
letter?
do
you
agree--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
an
opinion
letter
issued
before
this
transaction
took
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
owe
deference
to
the
dol
opinion
letter
of
1981?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
making
an
argument
that
somehow
the
taxpayer
here
did
not
have
fair
notice
of
the
coverage
of
4975?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
have
not
made
that
argument
really.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
100
percent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course--
--5
percent
for
every
year
plus
100
percent
over
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
because
keystone
has
never
agreed
to
correct
the
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wexler,
what
if
the
employer
just
outright
sold
to
the
plan
a
piece
of
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet,
it
would
be
prohibited
because
it's
a
sale
or
exchange?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet,
you
continue
to
take
the
position
that
a
transfer
to
meet
a
funding
obligation--
