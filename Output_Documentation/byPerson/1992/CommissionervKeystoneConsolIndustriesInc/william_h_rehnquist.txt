mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in--
--mr.
wright,
(c)(1)(a)
talks
about
prohibited
transactions,
and
there's
a
tax
imposed
on
them
of
5
percent.
are
there
any
other
consequences
of
prohibited
transactions
other
than
that
they
are
taxed
at
a
rate
of
5
percent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would...
that
could
be
based
on
the
fact
that
that
was
a
prohibited
transaction
under
the
internal
revenue
code?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
did
it
deal
with
section...
what
is
it...
4975(f)(3)--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
wexler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
something
different
than
an
ordinary
tax
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
refers
to
it
as
a
tax.
why
do
you
say
it's
a
penalty
rather
than
just
a
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
in
section
412
you're
speaking?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
412--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
now
the
government's
petition
sets
out
section
412(a).
i
don't
see
it
sets
out
section
412--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
is
412(b)
set
out
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
some
section
of
the
statute,
you
ought
to
set
it
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wexler,
you
don't
say
that
the
only
kind
of
sale
or
exchange,
as
described
in
4975(c)(1)(a),
is
one
that
meets
the
definition
in
(f)(3),
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
our...
we
simply
have
to
figure
out
or
courts
have
to
figure
out
what
the
term
sale
or
exchange
in
4975(c)(1)(a)
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wexler.
mr.
wright,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.

case
is
submitted.
