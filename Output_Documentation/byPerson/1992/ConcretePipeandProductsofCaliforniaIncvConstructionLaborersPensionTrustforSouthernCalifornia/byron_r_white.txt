justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
time.
at
the
time
it
did.
does
it
still?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
that
involved
in
the
young
case,
the
4
to
4
split
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
our
4
to
4
split
affirmed
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
the
trustee
presumption
really,
as
it
comes
to
us,
isn't
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
decision
below
on
these
presumptions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
they
actually
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
presumptions,
so
they
didn't
say
that
the
presumptions...
that
either...
they
didn't
say
the
trustee
presumption
was
not
implicated
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
actually
ruled
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
i
meant
to
ask
you,
you
weren't
involved
in
this
case
until
it
got
to
this
court,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
but
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
opposition
to
certiorari
suggested
that
the
trustee
presumption
was
not
at
issue
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thanks.
