yes,
they
have
had
a
relationship.
they
were
involved
in
the
same
base
of
companies
that
joined
together
in
this
plan.
that's
a
voluntary
relationship.
your
client
voluntarily
went
into
that
relationship
with
the
other
companies.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
wrong
about
that.
they
were
just
wrong
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
issue
is
what
their
reasonable
expectations
were,
and
you
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
that's
contrary
to
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you're
telling
us
you
thought
it
was
a
defined
benefit
plan
and
it
turned
out
not
to
be,
or
vice
versa,
and
i
mean,
that's
your
problem.
i
don't
see
how
that
renders
the
government's
ability
to
deal
with
you
as
someone
charged
with
that
knowledge
who
entered
into
that
arrangement,
i
don't
see
how
it
changes
the
government's
ability
to
deal
with
you
in
that
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
it
enough
if
you
have
a
reasonable
plan
that,
in
most
cases,
on
average
would
indeed
hit
the
employer
with
the
liabilities
that
arose
by
reason
of
its
participation?
now,
in
some
instances
the
scheme
might
not
work
out
that
way,
as
in
your
case,
because
your
employees
quit
before
the
10-year
cliff
vesting,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
an
irrational
scheme,
does
it,
just
because
in
some
cases
it
won't
work
out
perfectly?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
each
case,
or
just
generally.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
justice
souter
says,
ordinarily
the
more
you
pay
the
more
you
do
expose
the...
the
more
your
operation
does
expose
the
fund
to
greater
liability.
as
a
general
rule
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
okay.
you
don't
challenge
that
as
being
in
any
way
unconstitutional,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
that
actuary's
best
estimate,
is
that
what
you
want
to
be
able
to
show...
that
the
actuary
was
acting
in
bad
faith--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
that
he
was
just
in
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
their
expectation
was
not
that
the
same
interest
rate
would
apply.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
persuasive
to
say
that
indeed,
the
interest
rate
he
applied
later
was
even
a
little
better
for
them
than
the
interest
rate
he
applied
earlier.
their
expectation
was
not
that
he'd
use
the
same
interest
rate,
but
that
he
would
choose
the
best
estimate.
it
may
well
have
been
that
6
percent
was
a
good
estimate
earlier,
but
when
interest
rates
went
down
from
12
percent
to
7
percent,
maybe
he
should
have
gone
down
to
4.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
burden,
they...
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
prove
that
it's
wrong.
they
have
to
prove
that
it's
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
mean
just
wrong.
it
can
be
wrong
but
reasonable,
you
know.
somebody
could
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
have
a
biased
decisionmaker
make
a
decision
against
you
that
is
wrong,
and
you
can't
overturn
unless
it
is
in
addition
to
being
wrong,
unreasonable.
