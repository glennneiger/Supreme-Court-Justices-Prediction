mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
it
was
fully
cognizant
of
the
decisions
in
gray
and
connolly,
concrete
pipe
and
products
asked
for
hearing
because
it
believes
the
assessment
of
withdrawal
liability
under
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendment
act
is
unconstitutional
when
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
concrete
pipe
and
products
requests
the
court
rule
that
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendment
act
is
unconstitutional
under
the
substantive
due
process
and
takings
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
also
asks
the
court
rule
that
the
presumptions
that
are
set
forth
in
29
u.s.c.
1401
deprive
cp&p
of
the
guaranteed
right
to
procedural
due
process.
the
facts
which
distinguish
concrete
pipe
and
products
from
gray
and
connolly
are
the
lack
of
connection
between
concrete
pipe
and
products
and
those
who
will
benefit,
the
imposition
of
liability
without
responsibility,
the
imposition
of
liability
without
regard
to
the
employee's
expectations,
the
fact
that
the
act
uses
an
irrational
formula
of
increasing
liability
on
the
basis
of
the
amount
of
contribution,
and
the
retroactivity
involved
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
first
fact,
the
lack
of
relationship
between
concrete
pipe
and
products
and
those
who
will
benefit,
it
should
be
noted
that
this
act
would
require
concrete
pipe
and
products
to
use
its
funds
for
the
generalized
benefit
and
needs
of
members
of
society
who
have
never
had
any
relationship
with
cp&p.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
justice
scalia,
our
company
voluntarily
went
into
the
relationship,
and
the
relationship
was
defined
that
they
went
into
at
the
time
was
a
defined
contribution...
the
plan
held
itself
out
to
be
a
defined
contribution
plan
to
the
extent
allowed
by
erisa.
erisa
allows
defined
contribution
plans.
the
plan--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--oh,
yes.
erisa
still
allows
defined
contribution
plans.
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
in
1976,
when
they
entered
the
plan,
it
was
considered
to
be
a
defined
contribution
plan.
i
should
take
note
that
there
are
certain
allegations--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--i
do
not
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
an
unresolved
issue.
the
nachman
decision
by
this
court
discussed
a
case
and
held
that
a
particular
plan
was
a
defined
benefit
plan,
but
that
case
is
distinguishable
in
many
respects
from
this
particular
plan.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
we
did
not--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--that
it's--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--we
did
not
raise
it,
but
we
do
not
necessarily
concede
that
it
is
a
defined
benefit
plan.
this
is
not
an
issue
that
is
before
the
court
as
we
argue
the
case
today.
however--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--perhaps
it
could
have
been
argued
differently
below,
and
it
is...
certainly
to
assess
liability
under
the
statute
it
has
to
be
a
defined
benefit
plan,
and
certainly
it
has
been
considered,
i
presume,
by
the
deciding
parties
that
it
is
a
defined
benefit
plan
in
assessing
liability,
since
the
statute
clearly
states
that
there
is
no
withdrawal
liability
with
respect
to
a
defined
contribution
plan.
and
we
are
not
here
asserting
that
it
is
not
a
defined
benefit
plan,
but
we
are
asserting
elements
of
it
as
it
gave
notice
in
1976,
because
i
believe
as
the
original
question
was,
what
was
the
intent
of
the
parties
in
1976.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
in...
it
was
a
very
contingent
risk
under
the
original
statute.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
but
not
as
to
defined
contribution
plans,
and
it's
clearly
conceded
that
in
1976
everyone
believed
this
to
be
a
defined
contribution
plan,
so
if
you're
asking
what
the
intent
of
the
parties
were
in
entering
this
relationship
and
whether
they
agreed
to
become
liable
for
this
type
of
debt
when
they
entered
the
plan
on
december
1,
1976,
they
did
not
agree
to
assume
liabilities
to
other
employees
in
1976.
they
had
no
notice
of
that.
the
court
from
the
very
jurisdiction
of
which
this
case
arises,
the
central
district
of
california,
had
just
held
that
similar
types
of
plans
were
defined
contribution
plans.
the
allegations
in
our
complaint,
paragraph
14,
alleges
that
it
was
a
defined...
understood
to
be
a
defined
contribution
plan,
and
the
answer
did
not
deny
that.
the
answer
said
that
is
basically
true
until
1978.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
but
if
you...
if
the
issue
is
when
they...
there
was
no--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--well,
you
have
a
reasonable...
they
entered
a
plan
and
they
did
nothing
contrary
to
the
law.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
i
think
the
government's
ability
to
deal
with
us
depends...
i
think
what
we
are
pursuing
in
this
action
is
that
the
government
has
been
recognized
to
be
limited
in
its
ability
to
deal
with
us,
and
the
government's
ability
to
deal
with
us
is
that
it
can't
charge
one
member
of
society
for
debts
with
which
it
is
unrelated,
and
there
must
be
some
reasonable
relationship
in
the
legislation.
and
in
this
instance
we
assert
that
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
cp&p
and
those
employees
who...
or
those
employees
of
other
employers
who
will
receive
the
benefit
of
these
payments,
and
that
is
one
of
the
primary
thrusts
of
our
argument
before
you,
justice
scalia.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
interesting
that
in
the
connolly
argument
mr.
felner,
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
pbgc,
indicated
that
it
required
the
employer
to
pay
for
consequences
of
its
own
conduct,
and
when
he
was
asked
by
one
of
the
members
of
the
court,
what
if
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
employer,
and
he
specifically
stated
that's
not
before
us,
and
the
takings
clause
involves
transfers
of
the
property
between
unrelated
parties.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
if
the--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--i
believe
the
case--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--if
they
understood
at
the
1976
that
they
were
a
defined
benefit
plan,
they
would
have
therefore,
under
force
of
statute,
been
constructively...
had
constructive
knowledge
that
they
would
have
been
liable
up
to
30
percent.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
correct.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
we
can
view
it
as
a
defined
benefit
plan
here,
but
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
as
i
understand
it
is
to
determine
whether
the
application
of
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendment
act
that
was
passed
in
1980
is
applicable...
is
constitutional
under
the
substantive
due
process
clause
and
the
takings
clause,
and
i
think
that
that--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--actually,
it
added
it
go
up
to
any
amount
well
over
50
percent--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--in
our
circumstances.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
but
to
assess
us
with
the
responsibilities
under
this
act,
we
believe
that
they
have
to
establish
a
nexus
between
our
conduct
and
our
promises
and
these
payments,
and
what
we're
trying
to
demonstrate
is
that
there
was
no
reasonable...
and
as
we
state
in
our
reply
brief,
if
you
were
going
to
analogize
to
a
joint
venture
or
an
insurance
fund,
there
has
to
be
some
promise
made,
and
there's
no
reasonable
basis
for
asserting
a
promise.
the
trust
fund
itself
at
that
point
in
time
was
representing
itself
to
be
a
defined
contribution
plan.
the
trust
fund
itself
represented
to
the
employers
that
they
would
have
no
obligation
for
this.
the
trust
fund
itself
represented
to
the
employees
that
there
were
no
guaranteed
benefits,
and
that
was
the...
those
were
undisputed
facts
in
this
case,
and
based
on
those
facts,
there
was
no
knowing
or
no
constructive
promise
by
concrete
pipe
and
products
to
pay
the
unfunded
liability
of
employees
of
other
employers.
your
honor,
i
also...
we've...
i've
touched
upon
it,
we
also
assert
that
the
fact
that
the
statute
imposes
liability
based
on
the
amount
of
contributions
is
itself
as
demonstrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case
unconstitutional
and
irrational.
we
have
demonstrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case
that
concrete
pipe
and
products
has
paid
over
two
times
the
amount
of
money
necessary
to
fund
the
credits
earned
by
its
employees,
and
that
assumes
all
of
its
employees
vest,
and
we
know,
of
course,
under
the
ponds
case
that
96
percent
don't
ever
vest,
and
we
didn't
have
enough
time
in
business
for
them
to
vest
while
on
our
employment.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
if
it
was
related...
the
more
we
pay
related
in
some
way
to
the
credits
or
the
vesting
of
employees,
but--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--the
argument
i'm
making
with
that
fact
is
that
the
point
of
the
act
and
the
point
of
prior
decisions
is
that
an
employer
must
pay
for
the
liabilities
that
arose
as
a
result
of
its
participation,
and
this
formula
does
not
determine
or
even
come
close
to
determining
liabilities
that
arose
as
a
result
of
its
participation.
they
concede
in
their
opposing
brief
that
as
a
result
of
our
participation
the
employer
not
only
funded
all
the
credits
earned
by
its
own
employees,
but
also
twice
that.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
the
law
does
not
have
to
work
out
perfectly,
but
the
law
has
to
have
some
relationship
between
the
harm...
the
legislation
has
to
have
some
rational
relationship
between
the
harm
that
it
is
trying
to
address
and
the
remedy
that
is
provided.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
i
would
think
that
in
general
the
statute
has
to,
but
in
general
this
formula
does
not
address
that.
the
formula
says
that
you
simply
give
money.
we
don't
have
any
nexus
between
how
much
money
you
gave
and
how
much
the
liability
is,
and
the
more
you
give
the
more
you
owe,
so
in
our
case
if
we
had
just
paid
enough
to
fund
our
credits,
the
withdrawal
liability
would
have
been
approximately
$55,000,
but
they
don't
even
try
and
make
a
relationship.
it
doesn't
address
it.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
i
don't
think
so.
as
a
general
rule
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
with
how
many
hours
of
credit
or
how
many
months
and
years
of
credit
are
earned.
as
a
general
rule,
at
this
point
in
time
most
employers
are
paying
far
more
than
the
credits
that
are
being
earned,
as
a
general
rule.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
the...
we
are
suggesting
the
payments
should...
and
the
formula
should
only
relate
to
vested
benefits.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
i
would
even
go
so
far
as
relate
to
vested
credits.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
no.
my
theory
would
be
that
we
would
have
no
withdrawal
liability
if
we
contribute
enough
to
fund
the
credits
that
are
being
earned,
because
these
employees
may
perhaps
go
from
our
employment
to
another
employer
and
then
finish
their--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--that
is
one
theory,
but
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
because
our
proof
is--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--no.
we
believe
that
we
can
step
back
one
step
and
say
if
we
have
fully
funded
all
the
credits,
assuming
they
will
vest--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--well,
there
is
no
vested...
there
is
no...
by
definition,
there
is
no
vested
liability
at
that
moment
in
time,
but
there
are
2-1/2
years
of
credits
toward
the
10
years,
and
we
have
fully
paid
for
those
2-1/2
years
of
credits.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
we
would
have
no
withdrawal
liability.
i
would
also
like...
i
believe
that
while
we
are
discussing
this,
address
the
presumptions
issue,
too,
since
that
is
a
significant
issue.
under
29
u.s.c.
1393,
the
trustees
are
to
determine
the
unfunded
liability
by
using
their
best
estimate
of
anticipated
experience
in
determining
the
interest
rates
to
apply.
under
the
presumptions
that
are
used
in
deciding
the
issue,
there
is
no
opportunity
to
determine
whether
they
did
or
did
not
use
their
best
estimate.
under
the
presumptions,
an
employer
could
be
forced
to
pay
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
withdrawal
liability
when,
under
the
most
likely
evidence,
there
is
no
underfunding
at
all,
and
this
can
occur
because
the
trustee's
determination
as
to
the
interest
rate
must
be
accepted
unless
the
employer
proves
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
their
determination
is
unreasonable.
so
while
the
statute
says
they're
supposed
to
use
their
best
estimate,
the
statute
does
not
allow
concrete
pipe
and
products
to
prevail
in
this
case
by
going
in
and
addressing
the
proof
issue
that
they
did
not
use
their
best
estimate.
because
of
that,
this
is
not
truly
a
presumption.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
i
don't...
i
have
no
problem
with
merely
switching
the
burden
of
proof
and
allowing
us
to
address
best
estimate,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
statute
does
not
allow
us
to
do
that.
we
could
not
go
into
that
arbitration
and
present
to
the
arbitrator
concrete
pipe
and
products
should
win
because
the
best
estimate
is
this.
we
were
limited
before
the
arbitrator
to
attacking
their
presumptions
on,
is
it
within
the
realm
of
reasonableness,
and
of
course
they
all
concede,
including
the
trust
funds
themselves
in
their
brief,
that
liability
can
vary
widely
depending
on
the
assumptions,
and
that
they
further
concede
that
the
assumptions
can
be
reasonable
and
yet
result
in
no
underfunding
whatsoever,
or
large
amounts
of
underfunding,
and
given
the
nature
of
what
they're
allowed
to
determine--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--we
cannot
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
they
did
not
use
their
best
estimate.
at
no
point
is
there
a
proceeding
where
we
can
present
that
proof.
all
we
can
attack,
and
all
we
can
focus
on,
is
are
they
in
this
conceded,
everybody
concedes
there's
a
wide
range
of
reasonableness
and
that
on
the
one
hand
has
no
underfunding
and
on
the
other
hand
has
huge
amounts
of
underfunding,
and
this
is
not
a
presumption,
it
is
a
barrier
to
proof.
it
will
not
allow
us
to
go
in
and
say
the
best
estimate,
as
required
by
1393,
is
this
interest
right
here.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
the
arbitration,
and
there
in
fact
have
been
numerous
arbitration
decisions
where
the
result
was
that
the
arbitrator
has
found
that
it's
within
the
realm
of
reasonableness,
maybe
not
the
most
reasonable,
but
that
it
has
to
be
upheld
because
it's
within
this
wide
range
that
varies
from
no
liability
to
huge
liability,
and
that
is--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--that
is
the
estimate
of
the
interest
rate,
and
then
they
apply
that
interest
rate
to
the
presumptive
formula
and
come
up
with
their
unfunded
liability
determination,
and
in
so
doing...
in
so
doing
they
have
prevented
concrete
pipe
and
products
from
addressing
the
issue,
and
they've--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--we
have
to
prove
that
it
is
not...
with
respect
to
the
interest
rate,
that
it
is
not
within
this
wide
range
of
reasonableness,
that
in
this
case
they
used
6
percent
for
future
funds
which
their
actuary
admitted
that
it
was
on
the
low
end
of
reasonable,
it
was
lower
than
their
last
year's
10
years
experience,
but
he
also
figured
in
that
there
might
be
future
increases
in
the
benefits
and
so
therefore
used
that,
which
is
not
in
the
statute
at
all.
had
he
used
9
percent,
which
was
the
government
fund
at
that
time,
the
liability
would
have
been
significantly
less.
had
he
used
10
percent
or
11
percent
there
would
have
no
liability.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
this
is...
the
trustees
hire
actuaries.
the
actuaries
make
these
calculations
and
come
up
with
their
recommended
formula.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
it
is--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--it
is
originally
made
by
the
actuary,
and
the
actuary
is
hired
by
the
trustees,
and
the
trustees
are
well
aware
of
the
various
philosophies
of
the
actuaries
when
they
hire
them,
so
they
can
go
hire
actuaries
who
are
very
conservative
and
use
very
low
rates,
they
can
hire
actuaries
that
are
known
to
be
more
liberal
and
use
higher
rates,
or
they
can
use
actuaries
they
know
have
been...
used
more
moderate
rates,
and
it's
their
determination
as
to
which
actuary
they
use.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
i
don't
challenge
the
fact
that
they
go
hire
the
actuary.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
i
challenge
the
fact
that
i
can't
go
into
the
arbitration
and
establish
that
the
actuary's
low
6
percent
interest
rate
is
not
the
best
estimate
of
the
plan's
anticipated
experience.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
no,
i
want
to
show--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--i
want
to
show
that
that
is
not
the
best
estimate
of
the
anticipated
experience,
and
i
am
prevented
from
doing
that.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
in
this...
justice
souter,
in
this
case
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
is
because
of
the
nature
of
what
we
are
dealing
with.
we
are
dealing
with
a
prediction
of
the
future,
and
we
are
dealing
with
a
range
that--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--well,
certainly
a
same
scheme
might
apply,
but
i
have
no
problem
with
concrete
pipe
and
products
having
go
prove
that
it
is
not
the
best
rate,
and
this
is
the
best
rate,
but
i
want
to
be
allowed
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
it
is
the
presumption
that
it
is
within
the
range
of
reasonableness,
the
wide
range
of
reasonableness
that
we
are
attacking.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
but
it
is
conceded
that
the
range
of
reasonableness
when
using
these
investment
funds
go
from
very
low
to
high
and
from
no
liability
to
large
liability,
and
there
is
no
opportunity
to
have
any
realistic
determination
of
what
is
the
most
likely
result.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
the
concept,
the
range
of
reasonableness
and
if
it's
within
the
range
of
reasonableness
it's
okay,
is
being
attacked
by
us.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
range--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--i
think
that
proof
of
what
the
most
likely
proper
figure
is
is
something
we
can
discuss
or
present
in
arbitration--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--the
arbitrator
is
to
determine
what
is
the
best
estimate
in
view
of
prior
performance
and
likely
experience.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
i
believe
that
that's
what...
unless
they
do
that--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--it
is
a
difficult
standard,
but
then
again,
the
results
of
such
a
determination
are
the
difference
between
losing
half
of
your
assets
and
on
the
other
hand...
and
certainly,
due
process--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--due
process
has
never
turned
on
the
easy,
whether
it's
easy
or
not
easy,
it's
turned
on
whether
it
is
fair,
and
it
gives
a
just
opportunity--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--interest
rates
have
gone
down,
but
if
they
went
back
and
determined
based
on
the
10
preceding
years,
they
have
to
use
some
evidentiary
standards,
and
that's
all
we're
asking,
is
that
we
be
allowed
to
show
that
this
isn't
their
best
estimate,
and
we
are
prevented
from
doing
that.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
if
the
trustees
were
neutral,
this
obviously
springboards
you
into
the
biased
decisionmaker,
and
we
contend
that
they
are
a
biased
decisionmaker.
if
we
had
access--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--if
the
trustees
were
neutral--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--it
was
go
to
defeat
our
argument,
because
then
we
would
have
an
unbiased
decisionmaker,
and
we
do
not
have
an
unbiased
decisionmaker.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
well,
in
single
employer
plans
they're
usually--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--it
would
put
the
same--
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
--we
would,
but
these
particular
people
aren't
my
clients,
they
are
under
29
u.s.c.
1104
to
have
their
fiduciary
obligations
solely
to
the
beneficiaries
for
the
exclusive
purpose
of
providing
benefits
and
deferring
expenses
and
under
the
nlrb
amax
coal
case
it
is
specifically
held
that
these
trustees'
duty
is
antithetical
to
the
interest
of
the
contributing
employer...
i
had
to
look
that
up,
that...
the
definition
being
in
direct
and
unequivocal
opposition
to.
so
it
has
been
alreacy
determined
that
their
bias
is
for
the
beneficiaries
in
the
trust
and
not
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
employer.
thank
you.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
dennis
r.
murphy
your
honor,
the
sda
presumptions,
the...
page
54
of
the
appendix
clearly
shows
that
the
trustees
made
a
determination
that
the
withdrawal
occurred
in
1981
and
the
issue
was
whether
the
plant
was
mothballed
or
permanently
closed,
and
that
was
a
determination
that
the
trustees
made
and
it
was
challenged
throughout
the
entire
proceedings
and
the
presumptions...
there
is
no
disclaimer
that
the
presumptions
were
not
issued
in
their
favor
and
clearly
the
arbitrator
was
aware
of
the
presumptions
because
he
cited
the
presumptions
at
page
400
and
401
of
the
joint
appendix
in
issuing
his
second
decision,
so
it
was
a
decision
of
fact,
it
was
raised,
it
is
before
the
court,
and
it
needs
to
be
determined
whether
the
trustee's
decision
on
the
a
presumption
is
appropriate.
with
respect
to
the
statement
that
concrete
pipe
is
on
notice
of
the
actuaries
in
1976,
there
was
no
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendment
act
even
at
the
time
they
closed
their
plant,
and
there
was
no
presumptive
formula
to
apply
it
to
at
that
time,
so
there
was...
obviously
to
say
that
at
the
time
they
entered
the
plan
they
were
fully
aware
of
all
the
unfunded
liability
calculations
is
not
accurate.
thank
you.
