but
the
plan
that
you
entered,
your
company
entered
into,
is
not
acknowledged,
i
gather,
as
a
defined
contribution
plan
under
erisa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
since
then
decided
that
it
is
not,
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
you
didn't
raise
the
issue
here
or
argue
this
case
or
present
it
to
us
on
the
basis
that
it's
a
defined
contribution
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
took
it
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
it's
a
defined
benefit
plan.
you
didn't
raise
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
as
we
take
it,
we
have
to
consider
that
it
is
not,
even
though
perhaps
it
could
have
been
argued
differently
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
see
that
you
might
not
have
assumed
the
risk
for
back
in
joining
the
plan
was
that
the
withdrawal
liability
might
take
up
to
50
percent
of
your
net
worth
instead
of
30
percent,
as
erisa
had
limited.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
original
statute
there
was
a
contingent
withdrawal
liability
of
amounts
up
to
30
percent
of
the
net
worth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
murphy,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
suppose...
just
suppose...
that
instead
of
your
situation
there
had
been
a
defined
benefit
plan
and
that's
what
the
company
entered
into--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and...
and
entered
into
on
the
date
that
was
applicable
here
after
erisa
had
been
enacted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
under
that
assumption,
i
assume
that
you
would
acknowledge
that
the
company
could
be
liable
for
withdrawal
liability
up
to
30
percent
of
its
net
worth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
acknowledge
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
since
you
didn't
raise
the
question
about
this
not
being
a
defined
benefit
plan,
isn't
that
precisely
how
we
have
to
view
it
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
only
thing
that
added
was
that
they
could
go
up
to
50
percent
of
the
net
worth.
now,
maybe
you
didn't
anticipate
that
all
right,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
your
circumstances--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
amounts
to
50.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
open
to
you
at
arbitration
to
prove
with
regard
to
the
interest
rate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
didn't
erisa
as
it
was
originally
promulgated
create
a
distinct
investment
base
backed
expectation
in
the
petitioner
that
its
withdrawal
liability,
if
any,
would
not
exceed
30
percent
of
its
net
worth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
the
expectation
under
erisa.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
on
an
as-applied
challenge,
it
seems
to
me
you
may
run
into
trouble
on
the
excess
over
the
30
percent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
unless
it's
applied
and
assessed
in
an
amount
over
that,
you
don't
really
have
the
problem,
but
here
it
has
been,
apparently.
