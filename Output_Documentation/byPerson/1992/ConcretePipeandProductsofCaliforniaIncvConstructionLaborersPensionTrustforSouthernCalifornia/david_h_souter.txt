h.

isn't
it
also
the
case
that
the
more
you
pay
indicates
the
more
likelihood
of
proportionacely
large
claims
down
the
road?
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
now...
if
i
understand
you,
you're
now
turning
to
a
second
argument,
and
that
is,
during
the
period
in
which
we
paid
our
employees
did
not
work
long
enough
to
have
vested
benefits,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
is
foreclosed
by
the
fact
that
the
very
point
of
the
act
was
to
aggregate
the
periods
of
employment,
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
that
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
is
per
se
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
as
a
utility
rate,
wouldn't
the
same
argument
apply
in
a
utilities
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it
is
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
which
is
per
se
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
had
a
perfect
opportunity
to
prove
that
it
was
beyond
the
range
of
reasonableness.
if
you
can
present
convincing
evidence
to
that
effect,
then
you're
going
to
carry
your
burden.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
the
concept
of
reasonableness
that
the
actuaries
use
and
the
arbitrators
accept
is
itself
unreasonable.
justice
david
h.
souter
couldn't
congress
place
exactly
the
same
obligation
on
you
to
act
as
your
own
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
that
it
places
upon
these
independent
trustees?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
just
talking
if
congress
had
simply
written
the
law
differently,
and
said
that
you
the
employer
may
act
as
the
trustee
of
a
plan
for
your
employees,
congress
could
put
exactly
the
same
obligation
on
you
by
statute
that
it
puts
on
these
trustees,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
then
wouldn't
be
a
biased
decisionmaker,
you
would
simply
have
an
obligation
not
to
yourself,
but
to
your
employees,
or
to
the
beneficiaries.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
withdrawal
date's
a
trustee
assumption,
not
an
actuarial
assumption,
of
course.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
presumption
couched
both
in
terms
of
reasonableness
and
clear
error?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what's
the
relationship
between
those
two
standards
and
the
de
novo
review
standard
that
mr.
miller
was
speaking
of
at
the
time
his
time
expired?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
ultimate--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
is
the
ultimate
determination
that
the
withdrawal
date
was
august
15th
rather
than
september
30th,
is
that
a
mixed
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
appeal--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore
the
arbitrator
reviewed
it
on
a
de
novo
basis
as
a
mixed
question
as
to
which
there
was
no
factual
dispute.
justice
david
h.
souter
so--
