are
you
suggesting
the
payments
should
only
relate
to
vested
benefits?
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
you're
in
business
less
than
10
years,
you'd
have
no
withdrawal
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
about...
under
your
theory
you
should
have
no
withdrawal
liability
if
you
contribute
for
less
than
10
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
all
of
your
employees
had
no
prior
employment
within
the
industry.
then
i
think
under
your
theory
you
would
have
no
withdrawal
liability
until
after
a
10-year
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that's
where
your
argument
takes
you,
if
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
your
employees
have
no
vested
benefits,
they're
fully
funded
by
zero.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
would
then
therefore
have
no
withdrawal
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
murphy,
isn't
the
sort
of
a
fact
of
life
in
this
area
that
the
picking
the
interest
figure
does
involve
some
area
of
judgment
and
prediction
about
unknown
economic
conditions
in
the
future,
so
necessarily
it
has
to
be
a
range
figure,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think...
and
you
think
it
would
be
susceptible
of
proof
at
a
particular
point
in
time
what
the
exact
proper
figure
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
if
you
have
four
experts
come
in
before...
and
each
of
them
picks
a
different
figure,
one
takes
6,
one
7,
one
8,
and
one
9,
what
is
the
arbitrator
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
to
say
one
of
the
four
is
right
and
the
other
three
are
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
assumes
a
degree
of
certainty
about
future
economic
conditions
it
seems
to
me
quite
unrealistic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
a
very
important
decision.
i'm
not
suggesting
otherwise,
and
i
can
see
why
it...
you
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
6
percent
probably
looks
a
little
more
reasonable
today
than
it
did
at
the
time
when
it
was
made,
because
interest
rates
have
gone
down,
i
guess.
