would
you
make
the
same
due
process
argument
if
the
trustees
were
neutral?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
would
you
make...
if
the
trustees
were
neutral,
would
you
make
the
same
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
reference
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
presumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
date
that
the
employer
withdrew
from
the
plan
is
also
something
that's
determined
by
the
trustees,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
the...
do
the
trustee's
determination
of
the
withdrawal
date,
is
that
entitled
to
any
deference
in
the
reviewing
court
or
deference
before
the
arbitrator?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
assuming
the
trustees
are
biased
decisionmakers,
you
then
have
a
presumption
being
given
in
favor
of
the
biased
decisionmakers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
whose
judgment
is
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
reasonableness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
arbitrator
specifically
disclaim
reliance
on
the
presumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
presumption
as
to
matters
of
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
presumption
as
to
mixed
matters
of
law
and
fact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
presumption
as
to
this.
