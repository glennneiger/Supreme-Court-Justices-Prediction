mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two...
the
issues
before
the
court
today
fall
into
two
groupings.
one
is
the
extent
to
which
the
statute
imposes
upon
concrete
pipe
and
products
a
biased
decisionmaker
in
the
form
of
the
trustees.
the
other
issues
before
the
court
really
all
group
into
whether
the
product
which
concrete
pipe
and
products
purchased
was
what
it
thought
it
purchased.
whether
the
statute
constitutes
a
taking,
whether
it
constitutes
a
denial
of
substantive
due
process,
or
whether
the
actuarial
presumption
is
unconstitutional,
depends
on
the
nature
of
these
kinds
of
plans,
and
these
plans
are
not
as
concrete
pipe
and
products
represents.
the
connolly
v.
pbgc
and
gray
cases
validated
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
laborers
pension
trust
operates
under.
the
original
premise
of
that
pension
trust
was
that
employees...
employers
would
begin
contributing
today,
they
would
grant
pensions
for
employees
who
had
years
of
service
prior
to
the
existence
of
that
plan,
in
this
case
all
the
way
back
to
1937.
that
was
made
possible
by
acts
of
congress
as
it
went
forward,
and
congress
had
experience
with
the
failures
of
those
plans.
it
enacted
erisa.
prior
to
erisa,
this
plan
agreed
with...
the
employers
and
the
union
agreed
that
the
risk
of
loss
would
be
on
the
participants
in
the
plan.
if
there
were
inadequate
funds
to
pay,
then
those
who
thought
they
had
pensions
would
not
have
pensions.
congress
saw
fit
to
change
that
in
1974.
it
adopted
the
original
title
iv
which
had
a
30
percent
net
worth
risk
on
the
contributing
employer.
that's
30
percent
net
worth
on
the
employer
defined
as
the
control
group,
not
defined
as
concrete
pipe
and
products,
a
subsidiary
in
shafta,
california.
it
would
be
the
entire
company.
there
is
the...
when
concrete
pipe
and
products
came
on
board
in
1976,
after
erisa
was
in
place,
in
1980,
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendments
act
did
alter
the
nature
of
its
liability
from
a
contingent
risk
of
30
percent
of
its
control
group
assets
to
what
concrete
pipe
and
products
estimates
is
a
50
percent
liability
for
that
subsidiary.
there's
no
evidence
that
it
is
more
than
30
percent
of
the
control
group.
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
the
answer
to
that,
i
believe,
is--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--the
contingent
liability
of
30
percent,
that's
correct.
and
in
gray
and
connolly
v.
pbgc,
it
was
acknowledged
that
the
1980
act
was
a
prophylactic
extension
which
congress
had
the
ability
to
adopt
because
of
the
considerations
of--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--that
argument
is
equally
availing
on
a
facial
challenge,
because
every
employer
who
contributes
to
the
plan
and
chooses
to
leave
the
plan
has
that
same
exposure,
and
i
suspect--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--well,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
as
i
understand
it.
what
is
estimated
is
that
the
liability
of
concrete
pipe
and
products
exceeds
30
percent
of
the
subsidiary
net
worth,
not
necessarily
the
parent
company
which
is
the...
which
wholly
owns
that
subsidiary,
so
they
have
not
shown
on
an
as-applied
basis
that
there
is
even
that
differential.
secondarily,
the
other
misperception
is
that
the
plan
which
they
purchased
did
not
have
benefits
that
would
warrant
that
kind
of
adjustment
of
economic
cost
by
congress.
these
kinds
of
plans,
the
change
that
congress
wrought
upon
the
industry
was
to
say
from
here
forward
not
only
do
you
have
to...
you,
the
employers,
have
to
pay
in
sufficient
contributions
to
provide
pensions
for
those
who
are
already
vested,
already
retired,
who'd
worked
from
1937
on,
you're
going
to
have
to
speed
up
the
funding
that
future
employers
would
otherwise
have
paid
to
provide
retirement
for
your
employees.
so
beginning
in
1974,
a
compression
began
to
take
place
in
the
industry
where
employers
had
to
fund
the
past
contributions
and
they
had
to
fund
the
contributions,
the
service
credits
that
were
being
earned
currently.
that
is
reflected
in
the
table
that
is
reproduced
in
our
brief
that
shows
that
today,
or
that
as
of
1982,
the
employers
who
remained
in
the
plan
were
paying
$3
an
hour
for
funding
of
previously
promised
benefits
and
the
projected
cost
of
the
current
hour
that
was
worked
was
merely
55
cents,
or
thereabouts.
now,
those
employees
who
earned...
such
as
concrete
pipe
and
products
who
earned
a
contribution
that
was
worth
55...
that
would
cost
55
cents
today
to
pay
it
in
the
future
have
an
expectation,
and
concrete
pipe
has
an
expectation,
that
when
those
employees
actually
retire,
they
won't
be
receiving
whatever
the
dollar...
unit
dollar
amount
is
for
the
monthly
credit
that
they're
paid
today...
in
the
record
it
shows
$43.12
a
month
per
year
of
service.
rather,
as
the
years
go
by
and
contributions
render
it
possible
and
inflation
occurs,
trustees
have
the
discretion
to
make
further
changes.
that
was
the
attraction
to
a
plan
like
this.
it
is
not
a
plan
that
is
a
percentage
of
your
final
year's
salary,
it
is
a
plan
where
the
monthly
credit
is
specifically
defined
on
a
year-by-year
basis
and
it
increases
over
time.
concrete
pipe
and
products
says
there's
no
relationship
to
us;
we
got
no
benefit
from
this
plan.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
they
have
not
seen
fit
to
adduce
evidence
as
to
the
value
of
the
benefits
that
their
employees
earned,
how
many
of
their
employees
are
retired,
how
many
of
their
employees
are
vested,
what
the
actuarial
cost
of
those
employees
may
be
on
the
plan.
the
actuarial
cost
of
the
service
that
they
contributed
for
may
well
exceed
not
only
the
$100,000
that
they
paid
in
in
contributions,
it
may
also
exceed
the
$200,000
that
they're
being
charged
on
withdrawal
liability.
on
an
as-applied
basis,
it's
simply
not
before
the
court.
the
actuarial
presumptions
are
a
part
of
this
package
that
an
employer
purchases.
the
actuary
that
made
the
withdrawal
liability
calculation
is
the
actuary
that
was
the
actuary
for
the
plan
in
the
year
that
concrete
pipe
and
products
became
a
contributing
employer.
part
of
the
package
that
they
acquired
was
that
actuary.
the
actuarial
assumptions
about
which
they
complained
today
are
the
actuarial
assumptions
that
that
actuary
was
using
when
they
began,
and
the
methods
that
that
actuary
was
using,
when
they
began
contributing
and
when
they
left
contributing.
the
record
shows
that
the
changes
in
actuarial
assumptions
that
were
applied
to
concrete
pipe
and
products
by
the
actuary
as
a
matter
of
withdrawal
were
actually
more
generous
than
the
assumptions
that
were
strictly
being
used
by
the
actuary
for
the
plan,
because
they
gave
credit
for
higher
interest
rates
being
earned
on
assets
on
hand
reflective
of
pbgc's
single
employer
termination
rates,
and
they
only
retained
the
6
percent
actuarial
investment
return
assumption
for
the
unfunded
portion
of
the
plan
and
even
as
to
that,
they
excluded
from
that
the
assumption
that
that
6
percent
would
cover
the
expenses
of
operating
the
plan.
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
yes.
they
came
on
board
at
approximately
the
same
date
that
this
employer
began
participating
in
1976.
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
suggesting,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
methods
that
the
actuary
uses
to
arrive
at
the
6
percent
factor
are...
the
methodology
is
on-going.
it
is
the
same
methodology
from
the
day
that
they
began
to
present,
and
when
withdrawal
liability
became
a
factor
and
an
employer
left,
the
contention
is
not
that
the
actuarial
assumptions
are
wrong
for
an
on-going
plan,
the
contention
is
that
a
withdrawing
employer
is
being
unconstitutionally
impaired
by
being
unable
to
challenge
the
actuary's
assumptions,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
those
assumptions,
the
only
assumptions
that
are
different
from
a
withdrawing
employer
than
an
employer
who
purchased
the
plan
are
the
five
assumptions
that
are
set
forth
in
the
record,
and
those
are
generally
more
favorable
to
the
withdrawing
employer
than
they
are
for
the
ongoing
employers.
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
in
terms...
the
date
that
the...
our
perception
of
withdrawal
is
that
whether
or
not
an
employer
withdrew
from
the
plan
is
a
matter
of
law.
it
is
objectively
determined.
we
may
not
know
that
the
employer--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--the
presumption
would
apply...
the
presumption
in
favor
of
the
trustee's
determination
does
apply
to
all
determinations.
that's
in
this
case--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--that
begs
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
decisionmakers.
we
contend
that
they
are
clearly
not
decisionmakers,
they
are
in
the
nature
of
a
prosecutor
who
simply
investigates,
ascertains
that
a
complaint
needs
to
be
issued,
and
then
proceeds--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--whose...
yes,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
accorded
to
it
under
this
particular
statutory
scheme,
which
is
not...
we
submit
is
not
an
issue
of
constitutional
moment,
and
that
in
reality
what
is
happening
is
that
the
law
says
if
you
quit
contributing
to
a
plan,
you
owe
that
plan
your
share
of
the
unfunded
vested
liability
unless
you,
the
employer,
can
qualify
for
an
exception.
it
is
your
burden
to
prove
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
exception,
and
viewed
in
that
fashion,
the
burden
is
placed
entirely
appropriately
upon
the
employer--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--they...
unreasonable,
or
they
have
to
prove--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--if
it
is
still
a
burden,
it
is...
we
submit
that
it
doesn't
rise
to
a
constitutional
deprivation
to
have
a
stronger
burden
for
them
to
carry.
this
case
is
illustrative,
however--
mr.
john
s.
miller,
jr.
--the...
we
submit
that
the
trustees
are
not
decisionmakers.
they
hold
no
hearings,
they
adjudicate
nothing.
the
arbitrator
is
the
first
adjudicator.
the
arbitrator
decides
questions
of
law
which...
these
tend
to
be
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact
de
novo.
that
is
reviewed
de
novo
in
the
district
court
on
the
questions
of
law.
the
presumptions
are...
accord
facts,
are
with
respect
to
facts,
and
those
are...
i
will
let
pbgc
address
that.
thank
you.
