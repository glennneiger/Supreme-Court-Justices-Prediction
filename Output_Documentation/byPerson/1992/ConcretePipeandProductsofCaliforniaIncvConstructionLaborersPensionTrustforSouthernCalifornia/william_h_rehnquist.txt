we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number

concrete
pipe

v.
construction
laborers'
pension
trust.
mr.
murphy,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
constitution
requires
that
congress
say
that
if
the
trustees
are
going
to
use
their
best
judgment
that
they
must
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
you
could
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
they
were
in
error,
and
then
you
would
prevail
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
simply
the
estimate
of
the
interest
rate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
trustees
or
the
actuary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
the
actuaries'
judgment
that
you
seek
to
challenge,
the
best
estimate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
made
by
the
actuary
or
by
the
trustees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
murphy.
mr.
miller,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
you're
saying
that
the
actuary
who
made
the
interest
rate
determination
was
the
actuary
who
was
employed
by
the
plan
at
the
time
the
petitioner
here
got
into
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
ms.
flowe...
is
it
flowe,
or
flowe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
flowe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
flowe.
mr.
miller,
you
have...
pardon
me,
mr.
murphy,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
murphy,
the
case
is
submitted.
