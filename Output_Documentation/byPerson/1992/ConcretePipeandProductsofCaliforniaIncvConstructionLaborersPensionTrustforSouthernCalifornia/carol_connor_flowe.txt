thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
pbgc
did
not
participate
in
this
case
below,
but
when
we
learned
that
the
court
had
agreed
to
hear
it,
we
did
ask
to
participate
because
of
the
importance
of
this
act
to
the
financial
stability
of
multiemployer
plans
as
well
as
to
our
insurance
program
which
protects
the
pensions
of
the
millions
of
workers
in
those
plans.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
these
presumptions
and
what
is
and
isn't
properly
before
the
court
today.
section
1401(a)(3)
has
two
presumptions
applicable
in
arbitrations
under
the
act.
the
first
presumption
in
subsection
(a)
applies
to
determinations
made
by
the
plan
trustees.
i'll
refer
to
that
as
the
trustee
presumption.
the
second
presumption
is
a
more
specialized
presumption
in
subsection
(b)
and
applies
to
the
establishment
of
actuarial
assumptions
by
the
plan's
actuary.
ms.

only
the
trustee
presumption
was
found
unconstitutional
by
the
third
circuit
in
young
and
mcdonald.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct,
justice
white...
left
that
decision
standing.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct,
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
disputed
issues
of
fact.
the
trustee
presumption
does
apply
only
to
factual
determinations
of
the
trustees.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
because,
justice
souter,
there
are
different
kinds
of
determinations
that
have
to
be
made
under
this
act
by
the
plan
trustees,
and
while
we
certainly
acknowledge
that
this
language
is
inartfully
drawn,
we
believe
that
congress
chose
those
different
terms
to
apply
to
different
kinds
of
determinations.
for
example,
there
are
some
determinations
the
trustees
have
to
make
that
just
don't
have
a
right
or
wrong
answer.
they're
questions
of
judgment,
factual
judgment,
and
so
they
can
only
be
evaluated
on
whether
their
judgment
was
reasonable.
as
far
as
the
clearly
erroneous
part
of
that
language,
there
are
other
determinations
which
the
trustees
will
make
and
that
will
apply
to
all
employers
who
withdraw
in
a
particular
year
from
that
plan.
we
believe
in
order
to
ensure
uniformity
and
consistency
and
so
that
arbitrators
wouldn't
reach
compromise
decisions,
that
congress
wanted
the
employer
to
have
to
show
that
those
determinations
were
clearly
wrong
and
not
just
simply
wrong.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
the...
this
entire
presumption
applied
only
to
factual
determinations
of
the
plan
trustees.
questions
of
law,
or
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact,
are
determined
de
novo.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
those
that
the--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--again,
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
situation.
in
this
case,
the
facts
were
stipulated.
all
the
facts
were
stipulated
and
undisputed,
and
so
all
the
arbitrator
did
here
was
interpret
the
law
as
applied
to
those
undisputed
facts--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--and
he
didn't
have--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--i
was
just
going
to...
so
he
didn't
use
the
presumption
in
deciding
the
question
here,
and
appropriately
so.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
he
independently
analyzed
how
the
acts
should
be
interpreted
as
applied
to
these
facts
and
reached
a
decision
without
regard
to
any
presumption
at
all
in
this
particular
instance,
and
in
fact
this
trustee
presumption
was
applied
to
no
issue--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--in
this
case.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct,
justice
white.
just
as
the
court
said
only
2
weeks
ago
in
church
of
scientology,
the
court
just
lacks
authority
to
declare
rules
or
principles
of
law
where
it
won't
affect
any
matter
at
issue
in
the
case.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
the
arbitration
was
bifurcated.
the
first
arbitration
proceeding
addressed
the
date
of
withdrawal
question.
he
doesn't
even
so
much
as
mention
the
presumption,
even
its
existence,
in
that
part
of
his
decision,
in
that
first
decision.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
not
to
mixed
questions
either,
that
those
two--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--correct.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
the...
in
the
9th
circuit
there
was
a
precarium
one
paragraph
decision
issued
referring
back
to
a
previous
decision
of
the
9th
circuit
in
a
case
called
thompson,
where
they
had
upheld
all
of
the
act's
provisions.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
they
just
didn't
say.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
correct.
to
the
extent--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--the
district
court
considered
itself
bound
by
the
9th
circuit's
prior
decision
in
thompson
as
well.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
in
effect,
that's
correct.
arguably,
we
would
think
that
the
actuarial
presumption
is
also
not
before
the
court
here
today.
while
the
arbitrator
did
in
fact
recite
the
existence
of
that
presumption
in
reaching
his
decision,
it
seems
pretty
clear
in
analyzing
what
he
did
in
that
opinion,
is
that
he
weighed
the
evidence
and
the
other
testimony
that
was
presented
to
him
and
concluded
on
that
basis
alone
that
the
plan's
assumptions
were
reasonable,
but
the
thing
that
seems
clear
to
us
is
that
in
any
event
these
actuaries
who
do
plan
assumptions
are
in
no
way
either
biased
or
adjudicators.
i
mean,
they're
not
doing
an
adjudicative
function.
this
isn't
a
case-specific
kind
of
task
that
they
perform.
rather,
they
are
required
by
law
to
set
these
assumptions
in
advance
of
the
withdrawal
of
any
employer
to
whom
they
will
apply,
and
then
they
have
to
be
applied
across
the
board
for
the
period
that
they're
in
existence
uniformly.
and
contrary
to
the
company's
attempt
here
to
impugn
some
purported
bias
of
the
trustees
to
the
actuary,
in
fact
the
congress
made
it
plain
that
the
assumptions
have
to
be
the
actuary's
best
estimate.
if
they're
not,
they're
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
arbitrators
and
courts
have
so
found.
and
moreover,
these
actuaries
have
all
kinds
of
rules
they
have
to
follow,
and
if
they
don't
do
that,
their
licenses
can
be
suspended
or
even
revoked.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
scheme
that
mr.
murphy
suggests
here
would
simply
be
unworkable
in
terms
of
how
this
situation
might
work.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct,
justice
white,
after
the
court--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--it
did
not.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
the
scheme
that
mr.
murphy
is
suggesting
be
used
with
respect
to
these
assumptions
simply
wouldn't
work.
this
is
a
very
technical
and
complicated
process,
the
establishment
of
actuarial
assumptions.
there's
a
good
reason
that
congress
assigned
this
task
to
actuaries.
it
had
first
done
so
in
1974
as
a
part
of
its
enactment
of
erisa,
where
the
assumptions
were
to
be
set
by
the
actuary
for
purposes
of
funding
all
kinds
of
defined
benefit
pension
plans,
and
after
6
years
of
experience
in
using
the
actuaries
in
that
fashion,
it
again
assigned
this
task
to
them
in
1980.
the...
there
is
a
range
of
reasonableness,
that's
true,
but
it's
not
by
no
means
as
broad
a
range
as
mr.
murphy
would
suggest.
what
the
actuary
has
to
do...
and
there's
many
assumptions
here,
not
just
the
interest
rate
assumption
to
be
examined,
but
what
the
actuary
has
to
do
is
really
consider
what
liabilities
are
going
to
have
to
be
paid
by
this
particular
plan
over
30,
40,
50,
maybe
even
60
years
into
the
future,
as
the
various
participants
retire.
also
in
a
plan
like
this
one
that
was
very
seriously
underfunded,
the
actuary
can't
simply
pick
an
interest
rate
that
may
reflect
what
the
current
day's
investment
returns
are
going
to
be,
because
he
knows
that
there's
going
to
be
money
coming
into
the
plan
to
make
up
for
that
underfunding
over
all
of
that
many
years
into
the
future,
and
that
he
has
to
be
very
conservative
about
what
the
rate
of
return
might
be
able
to
be
40
years
down
the
road.
if
there
wasn't
some
presumption
of
reasonableness
afforded
these
actuarial
assumptions,
what
we
would
be
talking
about
is
a
situation
where
the
employer
could
make
the
plan
have
to
come
in
and
prove
every
element
of
these
complicated
determinations
in
every
single
case,
and
it
would
completely
defeat
congress'
purpose
in
trying
to
limit
the
amount
of
unnecessary
litigation
in
these
withdrawal
liability
collection
actions
to
let
the
plans
do
the
matter
expeditiously.
turning,
then,
briefly
to
petitioner's
other
constitutional
challenges
today,
in
response
to
a
question
you
raised
earlier,
justice
o'connor,
it
was
clear
in
erisa
in
1974
when
erisa
was
enacted
what
a
defined
benefit
plan
was
and
what
a
defined
contribution
plan
was.
congress
plainly
provided
that
a
defined
contribution
plan
was
a
plan
that
provided
an
individual
account
for
each
employee
and
that
a
defined
benefit
plan
was
any
other
plan...
that
is,
any
plan
that
didn't
provide
an
individual
account
for
individual
employees.
contrary
to
mr.
murphy's
contention
here
this
morning,
it
was
never
conceded,
certainly
by
pbgc,
that
this
plan
was
anything
other
than
a
defined
benefit
plan.
the
same
disclaimer
clause
that's
quoted
in
the
briefs
that
was
in
the
plan
in
1976
and
thereafter,
also
noted
that
the
plan
was
paying
premiums
to
pbgc's
insurance
program,
which
of
course
it
had
to
do
only
as
a
defined
benefit
plan,
but
under
protest.
i
believe
it
was
justice
scalia
who
noted
that
yes,
there
were
a
couple
of
erroneous
district
court
decisions
early
on,
but
the
law
was
clear,
and
we
believe
that
concrete
has
to
be
charged
with
notice
of
what
the
law
was
and
what
the
plan
was
it
was
joining.
we
would
simply
suggest
that
the
substantive
due
process
and
takings
challenges
in
this
case
are
both
governed
by
and
resolved
by
the
court's
prior
decision
in
connolly
and
gray,
and
i
thank
you.
