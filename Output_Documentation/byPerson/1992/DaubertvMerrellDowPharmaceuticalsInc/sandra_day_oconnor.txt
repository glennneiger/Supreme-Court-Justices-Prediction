justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
making
that
argument,
mr.
gottesman,
i
hope
you
will
address
whether
under
rule
702
the
words,
"scientific
knowledge",
tell
us
anything
about
what's
required.
webster's
dictionary
defines
702
doesn't
suggest
some
notion
of
accepted
knowledge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
both
refer
to
scientific
knowledge,
in
effect.
i
mean,
that's
the
basis,
and
i
notice
there
are
a
number
of
briefs
filed
here,
amicus
briefs
by
people
from
the
scientific
community,
and
they
all
tell
us
that
scientific
knowledge
is
more
than
just
one
person's
opinion,
that
the
essence
is
that
it
has
to
be
capable
of
being
tested,
and
something
that
isn't
tested
can't
be
said
to
be
reliable,
and
if
it
isn't
reliable,
it
can't
assist
the
trier
of
fact.
now,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
there's
a
role
for
the
trial
judge
in
determining
at
the
outset
what
comes
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
mr.
gottesman,
you
in
essence
reject
the
view
of,
let's
say,
the
third
circuit
in
the
downing
case
and
the
view
expressed
here
by
the
solicitor
general
that
there
are
certain
foundation
requirements
the
court
would
look
at?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fried,
may
i
inquire
what
the
standard
of
appellate
review
is
of
decisions
to
exclude
scientific
evidence
testimony?
is
it
de
novo,
or
do
we
have
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
a
little
lost.
is
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
also
tell
me
whether
the
so-called
frye
principle
was
followed
in
civil
cases
generally,
or
was
it
just
in
the
criminal
field?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.--
--would
you
mind
commenting
before
you're
through
on
the
proposed
standard
of
the
solicitor
general,
your
former
office,
and
that
of
judge
becker
in
the
downing
case?
