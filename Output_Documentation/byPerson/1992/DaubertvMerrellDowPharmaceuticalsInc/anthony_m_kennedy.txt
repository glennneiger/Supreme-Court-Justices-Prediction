justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
your
position
that
once
a
witness
is
qualified
as
an
expert,
he
can
testify
to
anything
within
the
area
of
his
expertise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i,
you
know,
assume
we
weren't
interested
in
weather
conditions
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
a
matter
of
relevance,
but
within
the
area
of
causation
with
respect
to
birth
defects,
once
any
of
these
experts
were
qualified
as
a
witness,
they
could
testify
as
to
matters
of
causation
without
reference
to
the
methodology
of
the
studies
they
relied
upon.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
other
rules
of
evidence
that
qualify?
you
said
that
was
the
first--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
you'd
have
to
look
at,
and
the
second
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
before
we
get
to
that
point,
i
notice
that
section
702
that
justice
o'connor
inquired
about
is
not
part
of
your
calculus,
so
that
once
the
expert
is
qualified,
subject
to
the
other
two
sections
you
mention,
he
can
testify
to
any
area
within
his
expertise
whether
or
not
it
is
based
on
studies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
give
no
effect
to
702
in
this
calculus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me,
counsel,
that
703
simply
says
that
underlying
background
facts
and
data
are
admissible
if
the
expert
reasonably
relied
upon
them,
but
that
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
the
qualification
of
the
expert
to
speak
to
the
subject
under
702.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
formulation
that
you've
just
given
us
a
modification
of
the
frye
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
modification.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
it's
important
because
one
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
it...
opinion,
not
the
only
reading,
but
i
think
one
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
it
relied
on
the
frye
rule
per
se,
without
this
modification
or
explication
that
we're
discussing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
fried,
i
take
it
that
your
answer
to
the
questions
of
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stevens
are
that
you
place
principally
reliance
on
rule
703,
and
you
say
that
this
was
not
evidence
on
which
an
expert
could
reasonably
rely.
i
had
thought
the
purpose
of
703
was
just
to
allow
the
admission
in
evidence
of
facts
that
are
essentially
hearsay
facts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
gives
no
really
necessary
play
to
rule
702
at
all.
