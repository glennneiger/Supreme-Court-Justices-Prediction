justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
studies
in
this
case,
the
animal
studies
as
an
example?
now,
let's
assume
that
maybe
they
don't
really
tell
us
anything
about
human
beings,
and
therefore
an
opinion
based
on
them
might
not
be
relevant
or
helpful,
but
are
the
animal
studies
themselves,
insofar
as
they
prove
anything
about
animals,
scientific
knowledge
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
a
little
more...
just
stick
with
the
animal
studies
for
a
moment.
if
we
assume
they
are
scientific
knowledge,
what
is
it
in
703...
what
language
in
703
makes
it
impermissible
for
an
expert
to
express
an
opinion
based
on
that
scientific
knowledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fried,
is
it
not
true
that
in
brock
they
didn't
hold
the
testimony
inadmissible,
they
held
it
insufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
brock,
then,
we
would
have
to
assume
this
testimony
was
admissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
last,
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
about
brock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
suppose
one
possible
disposition
in
this
very
case,
if
we
weren't
sure
about
the
admissibility
but
we
thought
they'd
applied
the
wrong
standard,
would
be
to
send
it
back
and
either
say,
review
the
admissibility
issue
again,
or,
the
evidence
is
admissible
but
you
may
still
grant
your
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants,
as
they
did
in
brock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
taking
the
position
that
if
we
held
the
testimony
to
be
admissible
we
must
necessarily
say
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
should
be
denied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
you
would,
yes.
[laughter]
but
that
seems
to
be
your
argument.
