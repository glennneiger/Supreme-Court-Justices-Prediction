and
maybe
the
issue
is
whether
the
judge
can
review
the
expert's
determination
about
the
probabilities
in
this
area
of
uncertainty.
i
don't...
you
say
that
the
expert
has
to
be
an
expert.
he
has
to
be
qualified
as
an
expert
in
the
field.
justice

the
data,
you
acknowledge,
by
reason
of
703
has
to
be
of
a
sort
that
the
community
would
normally
rely
upon,
but
there
remains
the
last
step,
and
that
is
the
expert's
applying
these
data
to
the
scientific
problem
that
is
relevant
to
the
case
and
coming
up
with
his
conclusion.
is
it
your
position
that
so
long
as
an
individual
is
an
expert,
whatever
conclusion
he
arrives
at
on
the
basis
of
this
data
that
other
experts
consider
relevant
data
must
be
accepted
by
the
court?
justice

well
but,
no,
that
just
goes
to
whether
his
testimony
is
refuted
by
a
lot
of
other
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
his
is
the
only
testimony,
presumably
the
jury
could
accept
it.
what
about
section
401?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
evidence
having
any
tendency--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
make
the
existence
of
any
fact
that
is
of
consequence
to
the
determination
of
the
action
more
probable
or
less
probable
than
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
be
without
the
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
can't...
on
the
basis
of
that,
can't
the
court
make
a
judgment
that
even
though
the
data
is
of
the
sort
the
scientific
community
would
accept,
and
even
though
this
individual
has
wonderful
credentials,
it
really
just
doesn't
parse?
