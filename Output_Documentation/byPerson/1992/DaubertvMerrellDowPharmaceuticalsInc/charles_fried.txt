mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
scientific
knowledge,
which
is
what
rule
702
allows
an
expert
to
testify
to,
is
that
body
of
propositions
which
have
been
produced
by
the
methods
and
procedures
of
science,
and
it
is
the
heart
of
our
claim
that
the
propositions
offered
by
petitioner's
witnesses
have
not
been
produced
by
the
methods
and
procedures
of
science.
as
the
court
in
the
turpin
case
said
regarding
petitioner's
crucial
witness
here...
and
i
say
crucial,
because
it
is
the
only
witness.
dr.
palmer,
he's
the
only
witness
to
testify
that
it
is
his
opinion
that
bendectin
caused
the
limb
defects
of
these
petitioners...
said
of
dr.
palmer,
"personal
opinion,
not
science,
is
testifying
here.
"
"no
known
basis
is
offered.
"
so
we
do
not
speak
about
propositions
that
have
attained
the
level
of
certainty
of
the
laws
of
gravity.
i
think
that
this
contention
shows
the
whole
procedure
of
the
petitioners
and
their
amici
attack
on
what
not
only
this
court...
not
only
on
the
courts
below
but
a
number
of
courts
have
done.
they
caricature
what
it
is
that
the
courts
below
have
said
about
the
requirement
of
publication
and
peer
review.
none
of
those
courts
have
said,
and
it
would
have
been
an
absurd
thing
to
say,
that
scientific
opinions
or
propositions
may
not
be
testified
to
if
they
have
not
been
published.
there
are
many
scientific
opinions
which
are
either
too
particular,
too
fresh,
or
of
too
limited
interest
to
be
able
to
attain
publication.
what
these
courts
have
said
is
that
publication
and
dissemination
to
the
scientific
community
is
a
factor.
the
downing-deluca
court,
say
the
third
circuit,
specifically
said
that
it
is
a
factor
in
determining
the
reliability
of
scientific
evidence
whether
it
has
been
exposed...
and
i
believe
i
used
the
third
circuit's
own
words...
exposed
to
scientific
scrutiny.
now,
publication
and
peer
review--
mr.
charles
fried
--your
honor,
it
is
a
specification,
an
explication
of
the
approach
which
the
frye
rule
exemplifies.
we
think--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
if
you
will,
it's
a
modification.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
that
is
virtually...
that
opinion
is
virtually
a
summary
affirmance.
there
are
some
judges
who
take
about
5
pages
for
a
summary
affirmance.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
stated
that
it
was
incorporating
the
judgments
on
the
same
packet
of
opinions
in
the
first,
the
d.c.,
and
the
fifth
circuits,
as
they
said,
"for
the
reasons
stated
by
our
sister
circuits.
"
and
those
opinions
are
very
detailed,
go
into
the
witnesses'
testimony
in
great
detail,
and
that
is
incorporated
by
reference.
the
ninth
circuit,
having
seen
that
the
federal
courts
have
passed
on
this
a
number
of
times,
simply
incorporated
that
by
reference.
now,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
relying
on
rule
702.
it
cited
the
solomon
case,
and
the
solomon
case
is
a
702
case.
the
district
court
relied
on
rule
703.
the
lynch
court,
the
first
circuit,
whose
opinion
was
adopted
by
reference
by
the
ninth
circuit,
relied
on
703
and
403.
now,
frye,
i
think,
is
simply
a
shorthand
way
of
designating
an
approach,
and
this
is
another
one
of
the
caricatures
which
the
petitioners
are
required
to
emit
in
order
to
take
a
very
general
approach
and
make
it
seem
extreme.
the
frye
rule
is
a
very
brief
sentence
in
a
very
brief
opinion
in
1923.
it
represents
an
approach.
it
is
an
approach
which
says,
and
it
was
familiar
in
the
federal
courts,
it
was
stated
very
well
by
judge
hand
in
1901,
that
the
courts
must
look
to
scientific
standards
to
validate
scientific
claims.
now,
that
approach,
which
i
submit
is
very
general,
is
an
approach
which
reappears
in
the
federal
rules,
and
why
should
it
not?
the
very
words
which
justice
o'connor
was
emphasizing...
scientific
knowledge...
bring
that
approach
into
the
federal
rules.
why
should
that
approach
have
been
abandoned
without
a
word?
now,
if
there
had
been
something
like
a
determinate
rule...
the
frye
rule...
then
there
would
be
an
argument,
and
i
would
think
we
would
be
in
equipoise
at
best
but
the
frye
rule
itself
is
a
rather
ambiguous...
very
ambiguous
statement.
if
you
look
at
what
the
frye
rule
itself
is...
let
me
read
it
to
you
from
that
decision:
"the
thing
from
which
the
deduction
is
made
must
be
sufficiently
established
to
have
gained
general
acceptance
in
the
particular
field
in
which
it
belongs.
"
that
leaves
many
questions
unanswered,
and
what
i
suggest
is,
it
is
representative
of
an
approach
that
there
must
be
a
foundation,
the
foundation
must
be
a
foundation
in
scientific
knowledge,
and
that
the
courts
look
to
the
community
of
science
and
to
scientific
standards
to
validate
scientific
claims.
mr.
charles
fried
you
had
me
there,
mr.
justice...
justice
blackmun.
i'm
afraid
i
can't
tell
you.
i
should
know...
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
fried
may
i
return
to
the
publication
and
peer
review
factor,
because
a
factor
is
all
that
it
is.
there
are
many
circumstances,
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
where
publication
and
peer
review
would
be
impossible
and
inappropriate.
this
is
not
such
a
circumstance.
what
the
petitioners'
witnesses
were
seeking
to
do
was
to
propose
a
general
proposition
about
the
chemical
properties
of
a
much-studied
subject.
the
substance
under
consideration,
bendectin,
had
been
studied
for
over
a
generation
and
had
generated
a
vast
body
of
published
research.
what
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
other
circuits
have
been
saying,
and
here
the
fifth
circuit
is
particularly
explicit,
in
that
circumstance
where
witnesses
are
seeking
to
build
upon
in
order
to
contradict
a
vast
body
of
unanimous
published
research,
then
they
must
operate
in
pari
materia.
they,
too,
must
submit
their
research
with
a
clear
statement
of
their
premises,
their
methodologies,
their
conclusions.
mr.
charles
fried
the
rules
of
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice,
require
that
the
testimony
be
to
scientific
knowledge.
scientific
knowledge
is
knowledge
produced
by
the
methods
and
procedures
of
science,
and
under
certain
circumstances
there
is
no
more
elementary
method
of
science
than
the
method
of
dissemination
for
criticism,
replication,
and
review
by
the
scientific
community.
mr.
charles
fried
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
which
judicial
notice
may
be
taken,
that
replication,
that
the
community
of
science
is
the
test
of
what
is
science
is
one
of
the
most
elementary
facts
of
which
educated
men
and
women
are
aware,
that
science
is
not
personal
opinion.
it
has
been
stated
many
times
by
many
courts.
mr.
charles
fried
these
animal
studies,
if
properly
conducted,
and
some
of
them
were,
are
scientific
knowledge,
without
doubt.
the
opinion
based
upon
them
is
an
opinion
which
does
not
comport
with
rule
703,
because
rule
703...
and
here
the
advisory
committee
notes
are
particularly
important...
does
not
speak
only
of
the
type
of
information,
but
also
the
selection
of
information,
and
the
reference
there
to
public
opinion
research
in
the
advisory
committee
note,
your
honor,
makes
that
quite
explicit,
that
certainly
to
prove...
in
the
zippo
case
which
they
cite,
to
prove
that
there's
confusion
one
would
use
survey
data,
but
one
would
have
to
use
survey
data
in
a
way
that
survey
data
specialists
use
survey
data,
and
that's--
mr.
charles
fried
--animal
data
are
not
reasonably
relied
on
by
experts
in
the
field
to
reach
a
conclusion
about
human
teratogenicity
at
least
in
the
face
of
an
overwhelming
burden
of
human
data
which
points
in
the
opposite
direction.
animal
studies
are,
indeed,
used.
they
are
used
by
the
fda,
they
are
used
quite
generally
to
raise
a
suspicion.
they
are
like
a
scaffolding,
but
when
the
building
is
up,
the
animal
studies
drop
away.
the
animal
studies
cannot
support
a
building
which
will
not
stand--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
there
were
introduced
among
other
things
a
number
of
learned
treatises
on
exactly
this
point
about
he
importance
of
human
studies
in
this...
in
the
birth
defects
area,
and
how
human
studies
trump
animal
studies,
so
there
were...
learned
treatises
were
introduced.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
and
they
were
also
introduced
in
a
number
of
the
other
case
whose
records
were
submitted
in
this
case.
furthermore,
the
canadian
study
which
was
introduced
by
defendants,
which
was
a
meta-analysis
of
all
the
human
studies,
made
this
statement,
and
finally
the
petitioners'
own
witnesses,
some
of
them...
not
all
of
them,
but
their
own
witnesses
stated
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
reach
conclusions
about
human
teratogenicity
on
the
basis
of
animal
studies.
there
is
one
well-known
textbook
which
points
out
that
there
are
1,200
known
animal
teratogens
and
only
30
known
human
teratogens,
so
the
court
quite
properly,
under
rule
104(a),
reached
this
conclusion,
and
i
would
take
it
that
that
is
a
determination
by
the
two
courts
below,
and
not
only
the
two
courts
below,
a
number
of
other
courts.
mr.
charles
fried
rule
104(a)
allows
the
trial
court,
indeed,
requires
the
trial
court
to
make
a
preliminary
foundational
inquiry
whether
a
proper
foundation
has
been
laid
for
any
testimony,
whether
it's
opinion
testimony
based
on
personal
observation,
or
scientific
testimony.
that
authorizes
the
court
to
make
a
foundational
inquiry,
which
is,
indeed,
what
happened
here.
mr.
charles
fried
i
believe
it
cited
104(a),
but
i
can't
say
that
with
certainty.
that
was
in
any
case
the...
that
is
in
any
case
the
authorization
to
the
courts
to
engage
in
this
inquiry.
i
believe
that
this
court
in
the
bourjaily
case--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
allows...
rule
703--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
it
is
our
position,
elaborated
in
the
brief,
that
703
confirms
and
works
along
with
702.
703
allows
an
expert
to
base
his
opinion
on
hearsay
evidence
on
the
premise
that
the
hearsay
evidence
is
being
used
in
a
way,
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
702...
that
is,
to
allow
the
expert
to
testify
to
scientific
knowledge...
otherwise
one
would
have
the
anomalous
result
that
an
expert
may
not
rely
on
hearsay
evidence
in
a
way
that's
aberrant,
but
may
rely
on
personal
observation
in
a
way
that
is
aberrant,
and
we--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
general
criteria
which
were
stated
in
the
courts
here
are
criteria
of
law.
the
application
of
those
criteria
to
a
particular
fact
situation
is
a
discretionary
judgment.
however,
where
you
have
recurring
fact
situations...
indeed,
an
identical
fact
situation,
which
is
in
fact
what
you
have
here,
then
the
correct
application
of
a
general
standard
should
yield
a
uniform
result,
and
it
becomes
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
apply
that
general
standard
incorrectly
to
a
recurring
fact
situation,
and
courts
of
appeals,
as
the
fifth
circuit
did--
mr.
charles
fried
--it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
in
a
particular
case.
the
criteria
are
legal
standards,
and
therefore
are
reviewable
de
novo,
and
where
the
facts
do
not
vary
from
case
to
case,
then
the
application
of
standard
to
facts
must
indeed
be
uniform.
mr.
charles
fried
i
am
informed...
actually,
i'm
informed
by
petitioners'
counsel...
that
there
are
no
instances
of
frye
being
cited
in
civil
cases
prior
to
the
federal
rules,
but
it
is
also
the
case
that
expert
testimony
had
not
become
an
important
problem
at
that
point.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statement
of
the
frye
rules
to
suggest,
or
the
approach
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
matter
only
of
interest
in
a
criminal
context
where,
by
the
way,
it
binds
prosecution
as
well
as
defense.
mr.
charles
fried
in
our
view,
the
standard
offered
by
the
solicitor
general
does
not
differ
from
the
standard
we
offer.
rather,
it
is
a
matter
of
emphasis.
we
do
not
say
that
dissemination,
clear
statement,
an
offer
for
peer
review
after
dissemination...
this
is
not
some
bureaucratic
requirement...
is
a
necessary
or
sufficient
condition
for
admissibility.
the
solicitor
general
does
not
say
so.
we
both
say
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
petitioners'
testimony
seeks
to
comment
on,
build
on
and
refute
a
vast
body
of
published
statement,
and
there
is
no
exigency,
there
are
no
pressing
needs,
that
that
factor
is
determinate.
the
third
circuit
also
recognized
that
exposure
to
scientific
scrutiny
is
a
factor,
and
if
something
is
a
factor
there
must
be
cases
in
which
the
factor
is
determinate,
and
we
say
this
is
that
case.
so
we
do
not
think
there
is
a
great
difference
between
us,
except
of
emphasis.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
and
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
is
correct
there.
this
is
very
nicely
illustrated
by
the
controversy
petitioners
raise
particularly
in
connection
with
the
testimony
of
dr.
swan
about
the
so-called
rothman
mode
of
analysis.
now,
the
tests
which
petitioners
seek
to
refute
have
all
been
done
by
a
particular
statistical
technique
requiring
a
95-percent
confidence
level.
dr.
rothman,
who
is
petitioners'
amicus,
offers
a
different
statistical
technique
involving
nested
confidence
intervals,
displaying
a
vast
amount
of
data.
that
is
a
minority
view.
we
do
not
claim,
the
solicitor
general
does
not
claim,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
claim
that
the
dr.
rothman
procedure
is
ipso
facto
inadmissible.
that
would
not
be
proper.
what
is
the
case
is
that
dr.
swan,
so
far
as
we
know,
never
used
the
dr.
rothman
principle.
she
simply
pointed
at
it
and
said
that
i
have
something
here
which
contradicts
everything
else
using
these
other
techniques,
and
that
shows
why
clear
statement,
dissemination
to
the
scientific
community,
an
invitation
for
replication
and
comment,
where
all
that
is
possible,
is
absolutely
crucial.
if
dr.
swan
had
such
a
rothman...
such
a
rothman
analysis,
she
should
have
published
it.
she
never
has.
in
18...
sorry,
in
1987
she
testified,
no,
i
haven't
published
it
yet...
not
yet.
this
testimony
was
offered
in
1989.
in
1993,
so
far
as
we
know,
she
still
has
not
clearly
stated
her
premises,
set
them
out,
and
allowed
the
scientific
community
to
comment
upon
them.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
don't
believe
your
honor--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
it's
not
a
comment
on
the
behavior
of
the
witness.
it's
a
comment
on
the
behavior,
if
you
wish,
of
the
proposition...
has
the
proposition
stepped
up
to
the
plate
+/?
and
it's
quite
interesting
that
in
the
first
circuit
case,
the
lynch
case,
dr.
swan
had
been
forced
to
say
something
about
her
premises
and
methods,
and
the
first
circuit
went
into
it
in
some
detail
and
totally
devastated
it
as
arbitrary
and
unexplained
and
quite
unreliable.
that
illustrates
the
importance
of
the
publication
peer
review
factor,
and
it
is
only
a
factor,
in
appropriate
cases.
mr.
charles
fried
oh,
i
think
quite
clearly
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
judgment,
and
that
judgment
was
well-based,
and
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
most
striking
thing
is
the
solicitor
general
in
applying
his
standard
concludes
that
the
decision
should
be
affirmed
and
that
the
solicitor
general's
standards
clearly
lead
to
the
denial
of
admissibility
in
this
case.
it's
been
so
often
said
that
the
court
sits
to
review
judgments
and
not
to
revise
opinions.
the
opinion
in
the
ninth
circuit
may
be
viewed
as
a
little
breezy
and
a
little
summary,
but
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
federal
courts
had
seen
these
same
witnesses,
this
same
testimony
over
and
over
again.
it
has
parsed
these
witnesses
and
this
testimony
over
and
over
again.
the
brock
case
is
meticulous
in
its
parsing.
the
lynch
case
is
meticulous
in
its
parsing,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
for
the
reasons
in
those
circuits,
as
well
as
for
the
reasons
they
give,
we
rule
this
inadmissible.
mr.
charles
fried
the
brock
case
is
very
revealing
in
this.
the
brock
case
speaks
my
language,
i
believe,
and
the
solicitor
general's
language.
the
brock
case
says,
we
don't
say
that
this
is
the
be-all
and
the
end-all,
the
failure
to
state
and
disseminate
and
open
to
scrutiny.
what
we
do
say
is
that
it's
very
important
here.
it
certainly
gets
our
attention.
mr.
charles
fried
they
held
it
insufficient
because
they
were
acting
on
jnov.
they
had
already
been...
it
had
admitted
and
the
court
was--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
don't
believe
that
that
assumption
is--
mr.
charles
fried
--brock
was
a
sufficiency
rather
than
an
admissibility
case.
i
would
suggest,
justice
stevens,
that
if
a
court
says,
this
is
evidence
which
is
so
unreliable,
which
is
so
marginal
that
no
jury
could
rest
an
opinion
on
it,
that
that
is
the
equivalent
of
saying,
it
is
also
not
evidence
which
constitutes
scientific
knowledge,
or
which,
if
considered
by
the
jury,
would
not
mislead,
prejudice--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
it's
striking
that
the
brock
court
as
well
as
the
ninth
circuit
treated
those
two
standards
as
really
interchangeable.
you
can
either
do
it
on
summary
judgment
or
you
can
do
it
as
to
admissibility.
in
both
cases,
what
we
are
talking
about,
justice
stevens,
is
the
duty
and
authority
of
a
federal
judge
to
assure
that
a
jury
verdict
either
has
been
or
will
be
rationally
based.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
would
certainly
hesitate
a
while
before
i
said
that.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
were
treating
those
as
interchangeable
issues,
as
was
the
turpin
decision
in
the
sixth
circuit
on
summary
judgment.
they
were
treating
those
as
equivalent
issues.
mr.
charles
fried
that
was
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
that
was
the
decision
in
the
lynch
case.
mr.
charles
fried
that
was
the
decision
in
the
richardson
case,
and
those
cases
also
were
incorporated
by
reference
by
the
ninth
circuit
quite
explicitly,
and
they
did
not...
and
they
were
not
summary
judgment,
they
were
indeed
admissibility
cases.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
speak
my
language
in
another
case,
but
what
they
said
was
to
emphasize
a
factor
which
is
dispositive
here.
i
cannot
believe
that
the
lynch
court
or
the
richardson
court
would
say
of
an
opinion
about
what
caused
a
particular
accident
that
that
opinion
had
to
be
published
or
peer-reviewed...
certainly
not.
those
cases
referred
to
publication
and
peer
review
in
the
context
of
the
circumstances,
in
the
context
of
that
case.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
determinative
because
the
petitioners
seek
to
overcome
and,
indeed,
use
published
peer
review
material.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
mr.
charles
fried
yes.
there
are
harvard
law
professors
all
over
the
court
this
week,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
fried
i
hoped
i
had,
your
honor.
thank
you.
