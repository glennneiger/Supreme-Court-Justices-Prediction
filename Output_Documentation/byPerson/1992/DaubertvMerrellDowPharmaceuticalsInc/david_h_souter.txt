justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gottesman,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
what
you
are
telling
us
is
that
once
an
expert
has
been
qualified
as
an
expert
in
the
field,
and
once
the
expert
has
at
least
made
a
showing
or
a
showing
is
at
least
possible
that
the
expert
has
based
some
opinion
on
the
kind
of
facts
and
data
that
703
refer
to,
that
the
testimony
of
the
expert
himself,
that
he
is
competent
to
express
an
opinion
on
probability...
i.e.,
the
51
percent
or
better
chance...
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
foundation
or
knowledge
requirement
of
702?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
any
expert
who
says,
i
can
testify
to
a
probability,
necessarily
qualifies
as
competent
to...
or
as
having
satisfied
the
foundational
requirement
of
702.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
maybe
i'll
just
modify
justice
kennedy's
question
slightly.
you
are
saying
that
702
in
effect
substitutes
for
the
foundational
requirement.
we'll
assume
the
expert
is
qualified.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
foundation
for
the
opinion,
and
you
are
simply
saying
that
provided
the
expert
can
be
said
to
have
relied
upon
facts
and
data
and
provided
that
the
expert
is
indeed
qualified
as
an
expert
in
the
field,
that
the
readiness
of
the
expert
to
couch
his
testimony
in
terms
of
a
probability
judgment
is
a
sufficient
satisfaction
of
the
foundational
requirement
of
702.
justice
david
h.
souter
every
expert
basically
is
guaranteed
qualification
at
least,
or
is
guaranteed
success
on
foundation,
so
long
as
it
is
his
own
opinion
that
he
does
have
a
foundation.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
fried,
there
is,
i
take
it,
a
difference
between
the
sg's
and
judge
becker's
view
on
the
frye
test
on
the
admissibility
of
an
opinion
based
upon
what
the
solicitor
general
called
a
significant
minority
view.
i
take
it
frye
would
not
let
that
in.
is
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
significance
of
the
minority
view
is
in
part
a
function
of
circumstantial
evidence,
in
a
way.
it
is
to
be
assessed
in
part
by
a
court
based
on
the
way
the
person
claiming
to
offer
it
has
behaved
in
the
past.
justice
david
h.
souter
i.e.,
has
the
person
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
subjected
this
to
scrutiny
or
has
the
person
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
nuts-and-bolts
question.
let's
assume
that
we
agree
that
frye
is
too
starchy
a
standard
and
we,
like
you,
would
find
a
place
for
the
solicitor
general's
view
in
construing
702.
what
should
we
do
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
should
we
adopt
the
solicitor
general's...
let's...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
i'm
about
to
do
it,
but
if
i
were,
should
i
take
this
opportunity
to
urge
adoption
of
the
solicitor
general's
standards,
or
should
i
send
this
case...
affirm
this
case
with
a
view
that
the
solicitor
general's
standard
is
open
for
development
in
the
lower
federal
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
cases
weren't
parsing
the...
based
on
the
solicitor
general's
standards.
