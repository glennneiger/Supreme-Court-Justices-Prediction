do
you
say
that
even
under
the
frye
test
this
evidence
would
be
admissible,
or
as
we
take
the
case
it's
either
frye
applies
or
it
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
base...
is
that
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
a
submission
on
summary
judgment
that
summary
judgment
should
be
granted
because
the
plaintiff
could
not
come
up
with
admissible
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
those
cases...
all
of
those
cases
spoke
your
language?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
this
factor
is
determinative
in
this
case?
