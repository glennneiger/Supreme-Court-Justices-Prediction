mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
jason
daubert
was
born
missing
a
part
of
his
right
arm
and
lacking
three
fingers
on
one
of
his
hands.
eric
schuller
was
born
missing
one
of
his
hands
and
with
one
leg
shorter
than
the
other.
in
both
instances
their
parents
had
taken
bendectin
during
the
first
2
months
of
their
pregnancy,
the
period
in
which
the
limbs
are
forming
in
the
fetus.
there
were
no
other
indications
of
what
might
have
accounted
for
these
birth
defects.
there
were
no
genetic
histories,
or
anything
else
of
the
like.
each
of
these
petitioners,
with
their
parents,
sued
in
the
state
courts
of
california
alleging
that
the
birth
defects
had
been
caused
by
bendectin
and
alleging
further
that
merrell
dow,
the
sole
manufacturer
of
bendectin,
had
been
culpable
as
a
matter
of
state
tort
law
in
the
manufacture
and
the
distribution
of
the
drug.
among
other
things,
the
allegations
are
that
merrell
had
concealed
the
discoveries
in
its
own
laboratories
of
the
effects
that
this
drug
had
on
animals
that
were
tested
and
that
it
did
not
provide
a
warning
consistent
with
what
its
own
internal
knowledge
was
of
the
propensities
of
the
drug.
if
the
cases
had
remained
in
state
court,
it
is
clear
that
the
expert
testimony
about
causation
that
is
the
subject
before
you
today,
that
that
expert
testimony
would
have
been
admissible
as
a
matter
of
california
law,
and
we
have
asserted...
and
the
assertion
is
not
challenged...
that
that
evidence
would
also
have
been
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
california
law
to
prove
causation
in
this
case.
but
merrell
dow
removed
both
cases
to
federal
court
on
diversity
grounds,
where
they
were
consolidated,
and
ultimately
merrell
moved
for
summary
judgment.
its
motion
did
not
go
to
the
question
of
culpability
but
solely
to
the
question
of
causation,
and
its
contention
about
causation
was
that
bendectin
does
not,
in
fact,
cause
birth
defects
in
humans
and
that
the
petitioners
would
be
unable
to
come
forward
with
any
admissible
evidence
that
it
does.
and
they
anticipated
in
the
motion
that
the
petitioners
indeed
would
have
experts
who
say
that
there
is
causation,
but
their
contention
was
that
testimony
would
not
be
admissible
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
and
in
consequence
the
petitioners
would
have
no
admissible
evidence
to
prove
causation.
now,
the
petitioners
countered
with
affidavits
and
testimonies
of
eight
experts,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
these
are
experts
several
of
whom
are
very
highly
credentialed
and
important
scientists
in
their
field.
one,
adrian
gross,
has
been
the
chief
of
toxicology
for
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
chief
of
pathology
at
the
food
and
drug
administration,
in
both
roles
responsible
for
making
these
very
kinds
of
determinations
about
causation.
another,
shanna
swan,
is
the
chief
epidemiologist
for
the
state
of
california,
responsible
for
determining
the
causes
of
birth
defects,
and
on...
we
have
described
others
in
our
brief.
each
of
these
eight
experts
in
their
affidavits
and
testimony
expressed
their
opinion
that
it
is
likelier
than
not
that
bendectin
is
a
teratogen
in
humans
at
the
normal
therapeutic
dose,
that
is,
that
it
causes
birth
defects
in
humans,
and
each
has
recited
that
the
methodology
by
which
they
arrived
at
that
conclusion
is
the
methodology
which
is
regularly
and
commonly
employed
by
scientists
in
their
fields
for
making
these
kinds
of
determinations.
indeed,
as
is
shown,
and
as
the
two
governmental
experts
testified,
the
methodology
they
used
here
is
precisely
that
which
they
use
every
day
in
the
performance
of
their
governmental
functions,
and
governmental
regulations
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
say
the
same
thing.
now,
what
is
striking,
and
i
think
needs
to
be
noticed,
is
that
in
this
record
there
is
nothing
that
challenges
that
the
methodology
that
these
eight
experts
employ
is
not
the
common
and
regular
methodology
for
making
these
determinations.
merrell
did
not,
in
response
to
these
affidavits,
make
any
record
demonstration,
did
not
cite
a
single
person
who
claimed
that
this
methodology
was
not
appropriately
employed,
but
both
courts
below,
responding
to
and
accepting
the
contention
made
by
merrell
dow,
concluded
that
the
proper
measure
for
determining
admissibility
of
expert
testimony
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
is
that
which
was
prescribed
in
the
frye
test,
namely
that
the
methods
and
the
principles
on
which
the
experts'
opinions
are
based
must
be
those
that
are
generally
accepted
in
the
scientific
community,
and
applying
that
standard,
both
courts
said
that
that
had
not
been
demonstrated
in
this
case
by
the
petitioner.
now,
that
poses
the
question
of
statutory
construction
that
this
case
presents.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
was
the
contention
below,
the
ninth
circuit
having
already
adopted
the
frye
case
before
this
case,
the
petitioners
were
obliged
to
argue
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
this
evidence
is
admissible
even
under
the
general
acceptance
test
of
frye's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
is
here
only
in
the
sense
that
the
sole
reason
the
ninth
circuit
gave
for
saying
that
this
was
not
generally
accepted
was
its
conclusion,
again
not
drawn
from
the
record,
that
scientists
will
not
accept
the
opinions
of
experts
and
their
methodologies
unless
those
experts
have
published
and
had
peer
review
of
the
opinions
that
they
proffer.
now,
we
do
contend
that
as
an
assertion
of
what
constitutes
general
acceptance,
even
were
that
the
test,
that
that
is
an
incorrect
and
a...
not
only
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
the
record
shows
that
indeed
scientists
do,
and
a
number
of
scientific
organizations
have
cited
that...
that
it
is
both
incorrect
as
a
statement
of
science
and
incorrect
as
a
construction
of
the
federal
rules.
that
is,
that
publication
and
peer
review
is
not
a
prerequisite
for
the
admission
of
scientific
expert
testimony
under
the
federal
rules.
but
your
honor
has
shaped,
i
think,
the
way
in
which
the
statutory
construction
issue
has
to
be
addressed
here.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
test
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
is
indeed
the
correct
construction
of
this
federal
statute.
that
is,
does
it
require
general
acceptance?
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
and
there
seems
to
be
a
rather
wide
consensus
among
the
various
groups
in
this
case
that
it
should
be
no,
the
court
then
does
have
to
address,
i
think,
well,
what
is
the
correct
construction
of
the
federal
rules
so
that,
whether
it's
going
to
decide
this
itself
or
remand
for
reconsideration,
there
will
be
a
determination
of
what
the
standard
is.
and
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
go
through
the
statutory
construction
analysis
in
that
two-step
way,
first
demonstrating
that
general
acceptance
is
not
the
test,
which
i
think
is
rather
the
easier
point,
and
then
addressing
what
is
the
correct
instruction,
as
to
which--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
let
me
jump
ahead
to
that,
your
honor,
although
i
do
want
to
ultimately
get
back
to
laying
a
firmer
foundation.
702
says
that
if
scientific
knowledge
will
assist
the
court
a
qualified
expert
may
testify
thereto.
we
agree
that
the
word
"thereto"
qualifies
the
words,
"scientific
knowledge",
so
really
the
question
is
what
is
the
importance
of
the
word
"thereto"
as
it
relates
to
scientific
knowledge?
what
the
advisory
committee
note
says...
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
very
informative.
i'd
like
to
read
it
and
then
relate
it
to
this
case:
"the
rule
recognizes
that
an
expert
on
the
stand
may
give
a
dissertation
or
exposition
of
scientific
or
other
principles
relevant
to
the
case,
leaving
the
trier
of
fact
to
apply
them
to
the
facts.
"
now,
it
then
goes
on
and
says,
"the
use
of
opinions
is
not
abolished
by
the
rule,
however.
"
"it
will
continue
to
be
permissible
for
the
expert
to
take
the
further
step
of
suggesting
the
inference
which
should
be
drawn
from
applying
the
specialized
knowledge
to
the
fact.
"
so
that
what
the
drafters
contemplated
in
702
is
that
the
expert
would
set
forth
what
is
known
scientifically,
and
from
that
would
be
permitted
to
infer
what
should
be
concluded
from
that.
now,
in
this
case,
if
you
read
the
testimony
of
these
experts,
they
are
putting
forth
scientific
knowledge
on
every
page.
they
go
through
an
explanation
of
what
all
of
the
animal
studies
have
shown,
how
to
interpret
them,
what
their
significance
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
rule
703
provides
in
terms
that
if
the
expert
is
drawing
on
facts
and
data
which
have
been
generated
by
others,
as,
indeed,
our
experts
were,
that
those
facts
and
data
must
be
such
as
are
reasonably
relied
upon
by
experts
in
that
field
for
making
determinations
such
as
are
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely,
and
in
this
case
the
record
shows
without
contradiction
that
the
facts
and
data
upon
which
these
experts
relied
are
indeed
precisely
the
facts
and
data
upon
which
all
experts
rely
in
making
determinations
of
whether
it
is
likelier
than
not
that
a
particular
toxin
is
causing--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--he...
assuming
that
what
he's
testifying
to
is
what
the
court
needs
help
on.
there
are
two
links
to...
there's
a
need
in
this
case
to--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
that's
right.
i
mean--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
think
the
answer
is
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
they
do
have
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
703
that
the
facts
and
data
that
they're
relying
on
are
those
that
scientists
reasonably
relied
upon.
that
said,
the
office
of
sections
702
and
703
are
completed.
there
are
still
two
gateways
that
may
lead
a
court
to
determine
that
that
evidence
is
not
admissible.
one
is
section
403,
which
says
that
even
as
to
otherwise
admissible
testimony,
the
court
can
make
on
a
case-by-case
basis...
and
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
to
be
determined
on
a
case-by-case
basis
by
the
district
court...
the
court
can
make
a
calculation
of
whether
the
probative
value
of
that
testimony
is
substantially
outweighed
by
the
danger
of
misleading,
confusing,
or
prejudicing
the
jury.
but
it
does
not
follow...
even
if
it
is
in
the
court's
mind
that
the
probative
value
is
low,
it
does
not
automatically
follow
that
it
is
outweighed
by
a
danger
of...
and
incidentally,
i
want
to
be
clear
we
don't
think
that
in
this
case
one
could
say
that
the
probative
value
is
low,
but
even
if
a
court
thought
that,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
jury
is
going
to
be
confused
or
misled.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
other,
and
i
think
the
more
important
safeguard,
is
not
in
the
rules
of
evidence.
the
more
important
safeguard
is
that
a
court
is
entitled
to
direct
a
verdict,
or
in
the
words
of
the
new
federal
rules
to
direct
a
judgment,
and
likewise
to
grant
summary
judgment,
if
it
concludes
that
even
though
there
may
be
a
scintilla
of
evidence
supporting
the
petitioners'
position,
it
is
overwhelmingly
refuted
by
the
contrary
evidence
such
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
conclude
on
this
body
of
evidence
that
the
point
for
which
the
expert
is
contesting
is
true.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor,
no...
703,
we
suggest,
is...
703
is
the
provision
in
the
federal
rules--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--we
do,
your
honor.
702
and
703
each
have
their
proper
office.
703
is
the
provision
that
addresses
the
same
thing
that
the
frye
rule
did.
that
is,
it
says...
its
title
is
"bases
for
the
opinions
of
experts:
what
is
the
foundation
that
will
be
required
for
an
expert's
testimony
to
be
admissible.
"
and
it
spells
out
what
those
bases
are,
and
it
includes
what
one
might
say
is
a
watered
down
version
of
the
frye
rule,
the
requirement
that
the
facts
and
data
upon
which
the
expert
testifies
be
those
that
are
reasonably
relied
upon
by
scientists.
the
office
of
702,
we
suggest,
is
quite
different.
the
two
are
not
both
talking
about
the
same
thing,
as
respondent
argues.
this
was
a
very
carefully
drafted
statute.
years
were
spent
by
draftsmen
putting
it
together.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
your
honor,
there
is,
i
think,
a
confusion
of
two
interfaces
that
i
would
like
to
suggest
will
explain
the
role
of
the
arguments
that
your
honor
has
just
referred
to
about
things
have
to
be
tested
and
validated
and
the
like.
there
are,
if
you
will,
two
different
scientific
modalities.
one
is
when
we
are
trying
to
decide
that
something
has
been
conclusively
established
so
that
we
can
declare
it
to
be
a
law
of
science,
and
there
it
is
undoubtedly
true,
scientists
do
not
say,
we
have
now
satisfied
ourselves
that
there
is
an
established
truth,
another
law
of
gravity,
if
you
will,
until
we
arrive
at
a
point
of
certainty
that
is
replicable,
conclusive,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
but
we
live
in
a
world
of
uncertainty,
and
for
many
purposes
we
can't
wait
until
science
arrives
at
the
conclusive
answer.
professor
nesson
in
his
extremely
cogent
article
makes
this
point
and
makes
it,
i
think,
as
effectively
as
it
appears
anywhere
in
the
literature:
"there
are
several
contexts
in
which
we
are
called
upon
to
decide
things
even
though
science
doesn't
have
a
conclusive
answer,
and
we
have
to
do
the
best
we
can.
"
he
cites
as
an
example
the
physician
who
has
to
decide
how
to
treat
a
patient.
if
the
physician
needs
to
know,
in
order
to
do
that,
what
is
the
cause,
the
physician
doesn't
say
well,
i
give
up,
science
hasn't
got
a
conclusive
answer
yet.
the
physician
says,
i
will
have
to
make
a
judgment
of
what
is
likelier
than
not
the
cause
based
upon
the
materials
at
hand,
and
professor
nesson
argues,
and,
we
submit,
persuasively,
that
that
is
the
same
thing
that
a
court
is
called
upon
to
do
when
in
a
state
of
scientific
uncertainty
it
has
to
decide
whether
causation
occurred.
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
plaintiffs
can
prove
this
scientific
proposition
to
the
degree
of
certainly
that
would
make
it
like
the
law
of
gravity.
the
issue
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
can
demonstrate
that
it
is
likelier
or
not
that
this
is
causing
that,
and
the
methodology--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--indeed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
your
honor,
yes,
subject
to
rule
403
and
subject
to
the
power
that
a
judge
always
exercises
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
to
say
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
possibly
be
persuaded
in
light
of
the
imbalance
of
the
others--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
section
401
defines
relevance
as
anything
that
makes...
that
tends
to
show...
i
don't...
i
forget
the
exact
word.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
any
tendency,
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
now,
let
me
suggest
what
we
have--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
your
honor,
i
could
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
case
such
as
that.
this
certainly
is
not
it.
it
certainly...
there
is
a
tendency
to...
proving
the
point,
to
know,
as
these
experts
have
testified
and
cited
published
reports
for,
and
that
the
government
has
confirmed,
that
bendectin
causes
limb
defects
in
animals.
it
certainly
tends
to
prove
the
causation
point
that
in
vitro
studies
have
identified
exactly
what
it
is
that
bendectin
does
that
causes
the
limb
reductions,
and
that
is
that
it
impairs
a
particular
substance
whose
function
is
to
bind
the
cartilage
cells
and
thus
to
create
the
limbs.
this
is
dr.
newman's
testimony
from
the
in
vitro
studies
of
this.
and
it
is
probative
to
know
that
that
substance,
which
is
impaired
by
bendectin
in
animals,
is
the
same
substance
that
performs
the
same
mission
in
binding
the
cartilage
cells
and
forming
the
predicate
for
the
limbs
in
human
beings,
and
it
is
probative
to
know
that
the
chemical
composition
in
bendectin
is
extremely
close
in
composition
to
the
chemical
composition
of
other
chemicals
which
are
widely
believed
to
be
teratogens
in
humans,
and
it
is
probative
to
know
that
when
studies
were
done
on
human
populations,
a
larger
proportion
of
the
women
who
took
bendectin
gave
birth
to
children
with
limb
defects
than
the
proportion
who
did
not.
all
of
this
is
probative.
what
the
lower
courts
have
said
was
yes,
but
prove
to
us
to
a
degree
of
statistical
certainty
which
would
give
us
95
percent
confidence
that
the
human
epidemiological
data
is
reflective,
that
these
higher
numbers
for
the
mothers
who
used
bendectin
were
not
the
product
of
random
chance
but
in
fact
are
demonstrating
the
linkage
between
this
drug
and
the
symptoms
observed.
it
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it's
not
quite
clear,
your
honor.
the
district
court
clearly
did.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i'm
sorry.
the
district
court
clearly
did.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
shanna
swan
and
jay
glasser,
the
two
epidemiologists...
well,
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
the
court
of
appeals
definitely
said
explicitly
you
can't
prove
your
case
just
on
the
basis
of
animal
and
chemical
data,
and
they
said
that
although
there
are
four
experts'
affidavits
saying
that
in
appropriate
cases
you
can
make
a
determination
that
it
is
likelier
than
not
just
from
animal
and
chemical
data,
and
saying
that
that
is
the
view
of
the
government
agencies
for
which
they
work,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
contradictory
evidence
from
the
other
side.
both
lower
courts
said
you
can't
do
it
from
that.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
exactly
what
the
epidemiological
evidence
would
have
to
prove,
except
that
it
plainly
rejected
what
was
demonstrated,
and
what
was
demonstrated
by
shanna
swan
was
that
if
you
used
a
degree
of
confidence
lower
than
95
percent
but
still
sufficient
to
prove
the
point
as
likelier
than
not,
the
epidemiological
evidence
is
positive,
so
that
implicitly
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying
we
will
not
accept
that
showing
at
least
if
you
have
not
published
your
results.
now--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
subject
to
the
back...
again,
assuming
that
he
has
satisfied
703
and
subject
to
the
back-ups
of
403
and
the
power
of
the
court
to
direct
a
verdict
in
appropriate
cases.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
say
that
we
believe
that
congress
rejected
it,
your
honor.
congress
relied,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
on
the
adversarial
process
to
demonstrate
that
a
marginal
expert's
testimony
is,
in
fact,
marginal.
there
are
some
who
disagree
with
that.
there
are
arguments
that
the
rules
should
be
changed,
but
we
think
that's
the
proper
reading
of
the
rules
as
they
presently
exist.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
qualifications
in
this
case
have
not
been
challenged,
your
honor.
these
experts
are...
at
least,
it
is
not
disputed
that
they
are
qualified
to
testify.
we
agree
that
of
course
the
expert's
qualifications
to
testify
on
the
subject
that
he's
being
asked
to
testify
about
are
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
determine.
section
702
expressly
says
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
think
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--and
it
is
within
the
area
of
his
expertise,
that's
correct,
subject
again
to
403.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
might.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
brock
court
expressly
said
the
testimony
was
admissible.
the
question
of
whether
it's
sufficient
to...
on
the
merits
is
a
question
of
state
law,
not
federal,
and
it's
our
contention
you
would
have
to
look
to
california
law
to
decide
whether
california
would
agree,
for
example,
with
the
district
of
columbia
that
this
evidence
was
sufficient.
the
human
data
does
not
in
this
case
trump
the
animal
data.
the
human
data
here
is
that
a
larger
percentage
of
women
who
took
bendectin
gave
birth
to
children
with
limb
defects.
the
question
is,
how
confident
can
we
be
that
that
is
in
fact
probative
of
causation,
not
at
a
95
percent
level,
but
what
drs.
swan
and
glassman
said
was
applying
the
rothman
technique,
a
published
technique
and
doing
the
arithmetic,
that
you
find
that
this
does
link
causation
likelier
than
not.
professor
fried
said
that
in
1975
the
problem
of
experts
was
not
perceived
as
it
was
now.
look
at
the
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
706.
that
note
says
we
are
worried
about
shopping
for
experts,
we
were
worried
for
venal
experts--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--thank
you,
your
honor.
