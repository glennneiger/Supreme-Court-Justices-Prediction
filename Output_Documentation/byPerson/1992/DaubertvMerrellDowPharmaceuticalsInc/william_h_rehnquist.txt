we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
92-102,
william
daubert
v.
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals,
inc.--
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you--
--mr.
gottesman,
does
rule
702
and
703
together
give
the
trial
court
some
discretion
in
allowing
someone
who
is
called
to
the
stand
and
is
qualified
as
an
expert
by
showing
background
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
a
preliminary
decision
to
be
made
by
the
trial
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
gottesman,
actually
say
that
you
had
to
prove
to
a
95-per-cent
certainty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
it
did.
you
said,
the
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gottesman.
mr.
fried,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
mr.
fried,
that's
fine
if
you're
trying
to
get
a
ph.d.,
but
how
do
the
rules
of
evidence
justify
that
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
we
know
that
on
this
record?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fried,
again,
how
are
we
supposed
to
know
this?
i
mean,
if
someone
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
had
testified
to
this
effect,
that
would
be
something
in
the
record
that
we
could
take
notice
of
and
perhaps
the
trial
court
could
have
taken
note,
but
you
know,
you're
a
lawyer,
you're
not
a
doctor,
and
here
you
are
telling
me
that
certain
things
are
so
in
the
scientific
field.
you
may
know,
but
i
don't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
introduced
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
rule
104(a)
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
104(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fried.
mr.
gottesman,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
