do
you
think
the
court
had
the
power
to
adopt
the
miranda
rule,
mr.
roberts?
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
if
asked,
what
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
waxman,
if
what
is
really
driving
the
miranda
requirement
of
certain
warnings
is
a
concern
about
voluntariness
of
the
statement
before
it's
offered
at
trial,
why
shouldn't
the
focus
on
habeas
go
to
that
question
rather
than
to
some
technical
question
of
whether
certain
magic
words
were
articulated?
why
isn't
it
better
that
we
focus
on
habeas,
on
the
real
issue,
rather
than
some
peripheral
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wait
a
minute.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
miranda
warning
in
all
its
technicality
is
constitutionally
mandated?
