justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
one
of
your
questions
in
your
petition
the
failure
to
exhaust?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
really
raised
the
exhaustion
claim
and
we
agreed
with
you,
why,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
see
the...
well,
i
guess
i
can
read
your
questions
as
well
as
you
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
never
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
stone
v.
powell
covers
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
the
miranda
rule
plays
a
role
in
preventing
the
extraction
of
possibly
involuntary
confessions?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
there's
some
sense
in
thinking
that
involuntary
confessions
may
be
unreliable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
the
miranda
rules
do
play
a
role
in
preventing
the
introduction
of
possibly
unreliable
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
stone
against
powell
has
just...
stone
against
powell,
the
fourth
amendment
cases
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
a
possible
reliability,
unreliability
of
the
result
reached
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
prevents...
it
helps...
you
just
said
it
helps
to
prevent
the
extraction
of
involuntary
confessions.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
little
far
afield
for
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
do
you
think
the
rule
is,
mr.
roberts,
when
on
habeas
corpus
there
is
a...
you
are
dealing
with
a
claim
of
involuntariness?
what
does
a
habeas
court
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
reviews
it
de
novo.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
a
considerable
undertaking,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
considerably
tougher
operation
than
applying
the
miranda
rules,
i
would
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whether
we
should
adopt
such
a
rule
even
if
stone
v.
powell
had
never
been
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
take
it
that
if...
say
we
thought
that
stone
v.
powell
was
completely
different
from
this
case,
it
would
still
be
open
to
us
to
say
but
nevertheless
we
should
say
that
the
miranda
claims
aren't
open
on
habeas.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment
to
make
him
speak?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
fifth
amendment
was
violated
only
by
the
introduction
of
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
has
a
right
not...
you
say
he
has
an
unqualified
right
to
remain
silent
under
the
constitution,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
waxman,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
have
a...
before
stone,
what
you
were
doing
when
you
had
a
fourth
amendment
issue
before
you,
you
were
really
asking
in
most
of
the
cases
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
namely,
whether
there
had
been
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
issue
in
most
of
the
cases,
and
yet
in
stone
we
said
that
you
needn't
face...
decide
that
constitutional...
and
that
is
a
personal
right
that
they
were
deciding--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
those
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
worry.
don't
worry,
we--
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
think
we
feel?
[laughter]
