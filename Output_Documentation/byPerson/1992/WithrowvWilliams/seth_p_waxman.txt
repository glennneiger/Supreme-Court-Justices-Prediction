mr.
seth
p.
waxman
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
four
federal
judges
who
have
considered
this
case
have
concluded
that
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
must
issue
in
mr.
williams'
favor
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
because
the
prosecution
introduced
at
his
trial
as
evidence
of
guilt
statements
mr.
williams
made
in
response
to
custodial
police
interrogation
prior
to
receiving
any
miranda
warnings,
and
second,
independently,
because
the
prosecution
also
introduced
at
trial
statements
mr.
williams
made
in
response
to
custodial
interrogation
by...
which
were
elicited
by
means
which
rendered
them
involuntary
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
unless
this
court
overturns
both
of
those
rulings,
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
must
issue
and
mr.
williams
must
be
given
a
new
trial.
the
miranda
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
stone
v.
powell
should
be
extended
to
claims
that
a
petitioner's
rights
under
miranda
v.
arizona
were
violated.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that...
of
course,
you
could
adopt
such
a
rule.
that's
not
how
the
question
is
phrased.
in...
there...
the
first
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
there
is
no
challenge
in
this
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--certainly,
your
honor,
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
miranda
claims,
it
could
and
must
reach
such
a
conclusion.
my
first
point
is
that
there
was
no
challenge,
though...
there
is
no
challenge
in
this
court
to
any
aspects
of
the
merits
of
the
miranda
rulings
below,
and
in
our
view
the
rule
announced
in
stone
v.
powell
should
not
and
cannot
be
applied
to
violations
of
miranda's
constitutional
rules.
the
rights
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
are
so
unlike
those
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
relationship
of
miranda
to
the
privilege
is
so
different
than
the
relationship
between
mapp
and
the
fourth
amendment,
that
the
concerns
that
inform
this
court's
decision
in
stone
and,
we
submit,
no
other
concerns
counsel
favoring
extension
of
that
rule
to
miranda
claims.
indeed,
those
factors
counsel
against
extending
the
rule
in
stone
to
miranda.
i'd
like
to
briefly
give
the
reasons
why,
and
then
explain
in
more
detail
why
i
say
this.
first,
because
in
complete
contrast
to
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
miranda
is
specifically
designed
to
and
does
both
prevent
the
constitutional
violation
from
occurring
and,
if
a
violation
does
occur,
it
redresses
the
constitutional
injury.
second,
unlike
stone,
which
reduce
the
burden
on
federal
courts
and
friction
with
state
courts
by
taking
federal
courts
completely
out
of
the
business
of
adjudicating
the
constitutionality
of
the
admission
of
physical
evidence,
depriving
federal
habeas
courts
of
the
power
to
adjudicate
miranda
claims
will
produce
no
such
result,
and
third,
unlike
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
miranda
is
not
unrelated
to
fairness
and
reliability
at
trial.
before
i
elaborate
on
those
three
points,
i
would
like
to
stress
two
points
which
i
think
are
very
fundamental
in
this
case,
one
about
stone
and
one
about
miranda.
stone
v.
powell
is
not
a
decision
about
the
scope
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
it
is
a
decision
about
the
scope
of
the
judge-made
exclusionary
rule
designed
to
reinforce
the
fourth
amendment.
stone
itself
makes
this
very
clear,
and
this
important
distinction
is
apparent
and
reiterated
in
all
of
this
court's
subsequent
decisions
that
have
declined
to
extend
stone
beyond
the
strict
confines
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
with
good
reason,
because
stone
is
bound
up
in
the
unique
status
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule.
with
respect
to
miranda,
the
contention
that
miranda
v.
arizona
announced
nothing
more
than
nonconstitutional
rules
is
wrong,
and
it
critically
obscures
the
issue
in
this
case.
we
readily
agree
that
one
thing
that
miranda
v.
arizona
did
was
to
announce
rules
that
are
not
required
by
the
constitution.
the
warnings
themselves,
for
example,
are
not
constitutionally
required.
miranda
says
this,
and
that's
what
cases
like
california
v.
prysock
and
duckworth
v.
eagan
are
about.
similarly,
the
mere
occurrence
of
unwarned
custodial
interrogation
absent
a
use
of
the
statements
as
evidenced
at
chief...
at
trial,
while
decried
by
miranda,
does
not
amount
to
a
constitutional
violation
because
the
statements
haven't
been
used
against
the
defendant
as
testimony.
this
is
the
precise
teaching
of
this
court's
decisions
in
michigan
v.
tucker
and
oregon
v.
elstad.
these
types
of
miranda
violations
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
they're
not
currently
enforced
on
habeas
corpus.
they're
not
enforced
against
the
states
at
all.
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they...
excuse
me,
i...
they
could...
they
are
not
enforced,
for
example,
on
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
state
conviction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
not
enforced
because
under
miranda
and
under
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
miranda
it
doesn't
announce
a
constitutional
rule.
it
announces
rules
that
there
are
good
reasons
for
police
to
follow.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
that's
precisely
my
point,
too,
justice
scalia.
those
kinds
of
miranda
violations,
like
the
violations
at
issue
in
eagan
and
tucker
and
elstad
are
not
at
issue
in
any
court.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
something
fundamentally
different,
because
in
addition
to
these
nonconstitutional
prophylactic
rules,
miranda
v.
arizona
announced
both
a
fundamental
constitutional
principle
under
the
self-incrimination
clause
and
a
prophylactic
rule
that
this
court
said
was
necessary
to
protect
that
right,
and
if
i
could
just
go
through
both
of
those
briefly,
i
think
it
would
at
least
point
up
my
understanding
of
what's
at
issue
in
this
case
when
you
are
asked
to
apply
stone
v.
powell
to
miranda
claims.
whatever
nonconstitutional
rules
miranda
announced,
it
also
unambiguously
holds
that
a
suspect
in
custodial
interrogation
has
a
fundamental
self-executing
right
to
remain
silent.
that
is,
to
say
nothing
that
the
prosecution
can
use
against
him
as
evidence
of
guilt
at
trial.
now,
that
right,
miranda
says,
under
the
self-incrimination
clause,
can
be
waived,
but
only
if
the
suspect
understands
the
right
and
understands
the
consequences
of
waiving
it.
that
fundamental
right
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
violates
the
fifth
amendment
to
make
him
speak
in
custodial
interrogation
if
he
doesn't
understand
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
that's
the...
the
holding
i...
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
that
the
amendment
itself
is
only
violated
once
the
statement
is
used.
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct,
and
i
misspoke.
in
michigan
v.
tucker,
that's
the
reason
why
there
wasn't
a
constitutional
violation,
but
it
does
say
that
in
the
station
house--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
not
accurate.
i
mean,
this
court
frequently
says
it.
what
it
means
is,
you
have
an
unqualified
right
not
to
make
statements
that
the
prosecution
can
use
against
you
as
evidence
of
guilt
at
trial.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
now,
that
can
be
waived,
but
it
can
only
be
waived,
this
court
has
held
many
times,
if
you
know
you
have
that
right
and
you
understand
the
consequences
of
it,
and
that
right,
interestingly,
was
violated
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
whatsoever
that
prior
to
his
receipt
of
the
warnings
mr.
williams
understood
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
not
to
make
statements
that
could
be
used
against
him.
now,
the
district...
the
lower
courts,
of
course,
did
not
base
their
ruling
on
that
finding,
because
they
didn't
need
to,
because
to
protect
that
constitutional
right
under
the
self-incrimination
clause,
miranda
holds
that
because
warnings
or
their
equivalents
are
necessary
to
ensure
that
a
suspect
understands
his
rights
and
the
consequences
of
waiving
it,
and
to
overcome
the
compulsion
that's
inherent
in
custodial
interrogation,
therefore
the
prosecution
cannot,
consistent
with
the
privilege,
use
any
unwarned
statements
it
made
in
response
to
custodial
interrogation
as
evidence
in
chief
at
trial.
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
record--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
record
on
that
issue
is
very,
very
sparse.
there
is
a
very
short
colloquy
that's
reported
in
the
joint
appendix
where
he's
asked
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
suppression
hearing,
you've
been
arrested
before,
and
he
says
yes,
and
the
prosecutor
says
you
understood
these
rights,
and
he
said
well,
i've
heard
some
of
them,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
in
fact
you
know
what
they
are,
and
he
says
no,
i
don't.
but
remember
that
as
this
court
reiterated
in
colorado
v.
connolly,
this
is
a
burden
that
the
prosecution
has.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
way...
if
the
court
below
had
to
reach
this
issue,
there's
no
way
that
any
court
could
find
that
the
state
carried
its
burden,
but
what's
at
issue
in
this
case
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
state
court
did
affirm
the
conviction.
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
fifth
amendment
violation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it's
a
conclusion
of
law,
i
suppose.
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
fundamental...
the
core
constitutional
right
was
not
litigated
in
this
case
at
all,
i
admit
that.
he
didn't
come
in
and
say
look,
i
didn't
knowingly
voluntarily
and
intelligently
waive,
because
he
didn't
have
to.
all
he
said
is,
i
was
interrogated
for
45
minutes
without
receiving
any
miranda
warnings,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
are
federal
courts
going
to
hear
that
kind
of
claim?
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
ruled.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
a
straight
miranda
claim,
but
nonetheless
the
kind
of
miranda
claim
that
this
court
has
held
over
and
over
and
over
again
is
one
that
is
required
by
the
constitution.
it's
require...
in
estelle
v.
smith,
chief
justice
burger,
speaking
for
the
court,
stated
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
directly
involved
here
because
the
state
used
as
evidence
of
guilt
the
substance
of
the
defendant's
disclosures
during
the
pre-trial
psychiatric
examination.
in
edwards
v.
arizona,
justice
white,
speaking
for
the
court,
said
the
use
of
edward's
confession
against
him
violated
his
rights
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
as
construed
in
miranda.
in
orozco
v.
texas,
this
court
held
that
use
of
custodial
admissions
obtained
in
the
absence
of
the
required
warnings
is
a
flat
violation
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
construed
in
miranda.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
were,
i
suppose
orozco
stands...
to
the
extent
that
it
stands
for
anything
novel,
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
one
can
be
in
custody
outside
the
station
house.
it
was
the
first
case
that
so
applied
it.
one
might
question
whether
on
the
facts
mr.
orozco
was
in
fact
in
custody,
although
i
certainly
would
argue
that
he
was.
he
was
awakened
by
a
number
of
police
officers
at
4:00
in
the
morning
in
his...
asleep
in
his
home,
but
that
statement
of
orozco,
as
i
think
the
quotes
that
i've
just
provided
to
the
court
from
estelle
and
edwards,
and
there
are
many
other
cases,
does
remain
good
constitutional
doctrine.
in
fact,
in
elstad
itself,
this
court
distinguished
its
prior
decision
in
united
states
v.
harrison
on
the
ground
that
there,
quote,
the
prosecution
had
actually
violated
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
rights
by
introducing
the
confessions
at
trial.
in
other
words,
what's
at
issue
in
this
case,
unlike
eagan
and
tucker
and
elstad,
is
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right,
or
at
the
very
least,
a
rule
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
is
required
by
the
constitution,
and
the
question
is,
can
this
rule
be
analogized
to
stone?
we
submit
that
not
a
single
one
of
the
factors
that
motivated
this
court's
decision
in
stone
to
restrict
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
counsels
that
result
in
this
kind
of
a
miranda
violation.
first
of
all,
the
foundation
for
stone
was
the
recognition
by
this
court
in
many,
many
cases
following
mapp,
that
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
was
not
a
personal,
constitutional
right
or
a
personal
right
of
the
defendant
because
it
can
neither
prevent
the
fourth
amendment
violation
from
occurring,
nor
can
it
redress
the
fourth
amendment
injury
that
the
defendant
has
suffered.
rather,
as
justice
o'connor
explained
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
duckworth
v.
eagan,
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
is
a
structural
device
designed
to
promote
sensitivity
to
constitutional
values
through
its
deterrent
effect.
it's
a
constitutional
rule,
but
it's
constitutionally
required
where
and
only
to
the
extent
empirically
it
serves
the
function
of
general
deterrence.
in
instances
where
there
is
no
empirical
basis
for
the
rule,
for
example,
where
the
police
are
acting
in
good
faith,
as
this
court
held
in
illinois
v.
krull
and
united
states
v.
leon
and
janis,
the
rule
simply
does
not
exist.
it
doesn't
extend
that
far.
and
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
stone.
in
stone,
this
court
concluded
that
since
the
deterrent
effect,
quote,
if
any,
of
applying
that
deterrent
rule
in
collateral
proceedings
is
negligible
at
best
and
the
societal
costs
of
enforcing
it
on
federal
collateral
proceedings
substantial,
therefore
this
court
held
that
this
judicially
created
deterrent
remedy
simply
doesn't
include
resort
to
federal
habeas
courts.
now,
miranda
is
totally
different
from
that
on
every
score.
in
the
first
place,
unlike
the
fourth
amendment,
which
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
trials,
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
clause
is
first
and
foremost
a
trial
right.
the
very
purpose
of
the
clause
is
to
protect
against
the
introduction
at
trial
of
compelled
statements
of
the
defendant.
indeed,
unlike
the
fourth
amendment,
which
is
violated
by
an
unreasonable
search
regardless
of
whether
a
trial
ever
occurs,
no
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
clause
is
ever
completed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
have
two
answers,
and
i
hope
i'll
be
able
to
remember
both
of
them.
the
first
one,
and
the
less
substantive
one,
is
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
this
court's
power
to
decide
which
constitutional
claims
are
better
to
reach
and
which
aren't.
this
court
could
decide,
as
it
did
in
stone,
that
there
simply
is
no
fourth
amendment
claim
that
a
petitioner--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
and
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear
enough.
the
warnings
themselves,
and
even
the
prohibition
against
unwarned
interrogation,
is
not
constitutional.
what
is
constitutional
is
the
rule
that
the
introduction
of
an
unwarned
statement
at
trial
violates
the
constitution.
now,
the
other
answer
i
have
to
your
honor
and
the
more
substantive
answer
i
have
is
that
what
miranda
v.
arizona
stands
for
is
the
proposition
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
imposes
a
standard
different
than
and
in
addition
to
the
voluntariness
standard.
under
the
self-incrimination
clause,
it
is
not
simply
enough
to
show
that
a
defendant's
statement
was
voluntary.
if
that
were
the
case,
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
ever
applying
the
self-incrimination
clause
to
the
states
in
the
first
place,
because
the
voluntariness
test
has
always
adhered
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
the
fifth
amendment
itself.
instead,
the
self...
what
miranda
holds
is
that
the
self-incrimination
clause,
a)
applies
in
the
station
house
and
b)
require...
allows
a
suspect
in
custody
the
privilege
not
to
make
any
statements
that
can
be
used
against
him
as
evidence
of
guilt
at
trial
unless
he
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waives
that
right,
and
i
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
v.
arizona
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
of
course
these
cases
would
not
have
been
otherwise
decided
if
the
only
issue
was
voluntariness,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
and
i...
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
dicta
in
miranda.
in
fact,
i
think
if
one
examines
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
miranda,
one
can
see
very
clearly
that
certainly
he
understood
that
the
court
was
announcing
a
constitutional
principle.
if
i
could
just
quote
the
beginning
of
justice
harlan's
dissent,
having
decided
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
does
apply
in
the
police
station,
the
court
reveals
that
the
privilege
imposes
more
exacting
restrictions
than
does
the
fourth
amendment's
voluntariness
test.
it
then
emerges
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
for
an
admissible
confession
that
it
be
given
by
one
distinctly
aware
of
his
right
not
to
speak,
and
shielded
from
the
compelling
atmosphere
of
interrogation.
from
these
key
premises,
the
court
develops
the
safeguards
of
warnings
counsel
and
so
forth.
similarly,
this
court
in
michigan
v.
tucker
stated,
before
miranda,
the
principal
issue
in
these
cases
was
not
whether
a
defendant
had
waived
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
but
simply
whether
his
statement
was
voluntary,
so--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--surely.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
yeah,
justice
scalia,
the...
when
i
agree
with
your
statement
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
constitutional
rule,
let
me
make
sure
that
you
and
i
both
agree
on
all...
what
i
understand
to
be
the
premises
of
that
statement.
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
clause
itself
is
an
exclusionary
rule.
in
addition
to
that,
it's
quite
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
core
fifth
amendment
right,
that
if
mr.
williams
came
to
this
court
and
said,
look,
those
statements
were
taken
from
me,
i
had...
with
no
knowledge
whatsoever
that
i
had
a
right
to
remain
silent
or
they
could
be
used
against
me,
and
the
state
agreed
with
that.
the
fifth
amendment
itself,
without
reference
to
any
prophylactic
rule,
would
require,
by
its
own
operation
of
law,
that
those
statements
be
excluded.
now,
miranda
also
applies
an
exclusionary
rule
which
does
sweep
somewhat
more
broadly,
because
in
some
indeterminate
number
of
cases
there
are
people
whose
statements...
unwarned
statements
are
introduced,
and
in
fact
it
was
a
law
professor
who
teaches
constitutional
law
and
was
not
at
all
coerced
and
made
a
deliberate
decision
to
waive
his
rights
and
try
and
talk
his
way
out
of
it,
but
constitutional
law
is
filled
with
prophylactic
rules
like
that.
indeed,
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
courts
to
give
meaning
to
the
core
principles
of
the
constitution
without
access
to
prophylactic
rules
like
this.
now,
the
reason
that
i'm
saying
in
this
particular
case...
let
me
not
take
on
the
burden
yet
of
all
prophylactic
rules
in
the
constitution...
with
respect
to
this
case,
the
fundamental
reason
why
what
this
court
did
in
stone
should
not
and
cannot
be
done
here
is
that
in
stone
this
court
was
not
dealing
with
an
exclusionary
rule
that
represented
the
personal
right
of
the
defendant
in
any
way.
it
was
a
rule
that
was
designed
because
over
the
course
of
years
this
court
threw
up
its
hands
and
said,
there
has
to
be
some
way
to
make...
to
enforce
respect
for
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
was
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
constitution
required
that
it
be
excluded.
i
don't
think
one
can
read
this
court's
decisions
in
calandra
and
elkins
and
linkletter
as
saying
that
it
was
his
right.
i
think
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
can
assert
it,
but
those...
this
court
was
careful
to
emphasize
throughout,
and
it
certainly
emphasized
in
stone,
that
it
was
a
constitutional
right,
otherwise
it
could
not
have
been
applied--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
the
states--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
it
was
not
one
that
either
prevented
the
fourth
amendment
injury
from
occurring
or
redressed
it
in
any
way.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
with
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--with
all
due
respect
to
both
of
you,
and
i
say
this
with
great
trepidation.
first
of
all,
justice
scalia--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
want
you
to
go
back
and
say
bad
things
about
me.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
very
well,
your
honor.
[laughter]
please
do
not
let
me
be
misunderstood
on
this
very
critical
point.
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
this
court
can
decide
that
some
constitutional
rules
can
be
enforced
on
habeas
corpus
and
some
can't.
i
disagree
with
you
on
that
point
most...
more
vociferously
than
anything
else
in
this
case.
what
this
court
said
in
stone
is
not
that.
what
this
court
said
in
stone
is,
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
doesn't
exist
in
habeas
corpus,
just
as
in
those
direct
review
cases
like
leon
it
said
it
doesn't
exist
where
there's
good
faith
reliance.
as
a
result
of
stone
v.
powell,
there
is
no
right
to
apply.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
if
it
turned
on
the
particular
phraseology
i
would
have
become
a
bunch
of
noodles.
my
mind
would
have
disintegrated
a
long
time
ago
reading
all
this
court's
and
the
lower
court's
habeas
miranda
jurisprudence.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
switch
places
with
you,
justice
white,
i
would.
my--
[laughter]
my
point...
but
this
is
serious.
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
one
cannot
dismiss
miranda
v.
arizona
as
dicta,
or
as
merely
announcing
nonconstitutional
rules.
miranda
announces
something,
a
sacred
and
fundamental
self-executing
right
under
the
self-incrimination
clause,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
different.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
could
be
enforced
without
miranda,
but
this
court
in
miranda
held
that
there
was
every
good
reason
not
to.
i
mean,
one
can
say
that
every
fundamental
right,
maybe,
somehow
could
be
enforced
without
access
to
a
rule
of
application.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's
so
awkward
that
this
court
explicitly
held
in
miranda
that,
because
it
is
so
impossible
to
determine
what
actually
went
on
in
the
station
house
and
because
it
is
so
impossible
for
courts
after
the
fact
to
gauge
the
amount
of
coercion
or
compulsion
of
the
atmosphere,
that
it
heeded
its
own
words
and
plea
in
culombe
v.
connecticut
and
announced
this
rule.
of
course,
one
could
say--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
submit
that
is
a
completely
different
question,
but
because
when
one
is,
quote,
enforcing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
it's
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that
there
is
great
cause
to
question
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
causes
it
to
be
enforced,
period,
one
in
which
this
court
has
held
many
times,
but
it
is
a
fundamental
of
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
clause
that
it
includes
an
exclusionary
rule.
if
i
could
just
say
one
word,
please,
if
i
have
time,
about
the
exhaustion
point,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
is
clear
at
least
on
what
my
position
is.
our
position
is
that
the
exhaustion
claim
raised
in
this
court
should
not
be
considered,
because
it
is
the
end
game
of
a
deliberate
strategy
of
the
state
to
sandbag
the
federal
courts
in
violation
of
what
this
court
in
granberry
v.
greer
said
should
not
be
allowed
to
happen.
the
prosecutor
is
now
stating
that...
at
oral
argument
it's
clear
that
the
state
invited
the
court
of
appeals
to
overlook
the
exhaustion
argument
without
making
any
distinction
whatsoever
in
its
briefs
or
in
oral
argument
between
miranda
involuntariness,
and
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
found
that
at
oral
argument
the
exhaustion
position
had
been
effectively
conceded
by
the
state.
that--
thank
you.
