justice
antonin
scalia
more
specifically,
though--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
you
object
that
the
involuntariness
claim
had
never
been
raised
in
the
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
percentage
of
cases
does
the
miranda
claim
succeed?
i
mean,
i
guess
that's
a
crucial
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
because
we're
going
to
have
to
go
through
the
involuntariness
anyway
every
time
a
miranda
claim
is
made
unless
we
find
that
we
throw
the
whole
thing
out
because
of
the
miranda
claim,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
percentage
of
miranda
claims
succeed,
do
you
think,
on
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
reason
to
think
it's
like,
90
percent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
successful?
justice
antonin
scalia
probably
more
don't
succeed
than
succeed.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
certainly
my
impression.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
law
of
the
united
states
that
was
involved
in
stone?
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
it
raised
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
involuntariness
point
raised
in
the
habeas
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
that
a
possible
obstacle
to
whether
it's
properly
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
absence
of
anybody
knowing
that
it
was
before
it
and
having
any
opportunity
to
speak
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
places
it
properly
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
think
there's
properly
before
us
the
question
of
whether
it
was
validly
reached,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
being
before
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
a
question
we
have
to
consider?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
as
well
as
then
to
judge
the
record
that
was
made
by
a
prosecution
that
had
no
notice
that
this
issue
was
even
going
to
be
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
how
are
they
ever
enforced
outside
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
how
they
are
ever
enforced
unless
a
non-mirandized
confession
is
sought
to
be
admitted.
the
fact
that
you
get
a
confession
without
mirandizing
is
cost-free,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
enforced
in
any
forum,
neither
habeas
or
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
my
point
is
that
habeas
is
not
distinctive
in
that
regard.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
been
mirandized
before
in
other...
after
other
arrests,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
find
it
very
persuasive
that
he'd
been
tricked
into
confessing
when
he's
been
mirandized
on
other
occasions.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
but
surely
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
constitutional
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
we
have
drawn
the
line
on
habeas
with
respect
to
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
how
can
you
square
that
with
your
earlier
assertion
that
we
have
no
power
or
no
right
to
make
a
distinction
between
various
constitutional
rules?
now,
what
you
say
is
well,
we
did
it
in
stone
on
the
basis
of
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
rule,
and
we
can't
do
it
here
on
the
basis
of
the
purpose.
perhaps
that's
so,
but
that
does
not
establish
that
we
can't
do
it
here
on
some
other
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
it
was
surely
his
constitutional
right
at
trial
in
the
state
court
before
habeas...
it
was
his
constitutional
right
to
have
that
evidence
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
it
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
his
right.
somebody
else
could
have
asserted
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that,
but
all
we're
saying
then...
i
think...
i
guess
we're
in
agreement
that
you
can,
on
habeas,
enforce...
decide
that
because
of
the
nature
of
habeas
some
constitutional
rights
need
not
be
enforced.
thereafter,
the
disagreement
is
over
whether
the
reasons
for
enforcing
it
here
are
as...
for
not
enforcing
it
here
are
as
justifiable
as
the
reasons
for
not
enforcing
it
in
stone.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
hard
feelings,
mr.
waxman.
go
on,
let
us
have
it.
[laughter]
