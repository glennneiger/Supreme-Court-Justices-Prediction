m.
kennedy
you
have
no
disagreement
with
the
proposition
that
voluntariness
can
be
tested
on
habeas.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
an
element
of
voluntariness
whether
or
not
a
miranda
warning
has
been
given?
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
we
adopted
your
rule,
we
would
be
inquiring
into
whether
or
not
the
miranda
warning
had
been
given
and
its
effect
in
any
event
in
all
those
voluntariness
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
voluntariness
issue
is
before
us?
