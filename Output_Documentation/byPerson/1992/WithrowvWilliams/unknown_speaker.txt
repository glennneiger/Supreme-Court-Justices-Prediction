it's
not
over.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown

in
any

i
mean,
in
a
case
in
which
the
miranda
claim
succeeds,
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
think
so,
too.
do
you
have
any...
and
i
assume
you
don't,
but
i
don't
want
to
overlook
it.
do
you
have
any
facts,
any
statistics
on
the
percentage
or
the
number
of
cases
on
which
the
miranda
claim
fails
and
voluntariness
is
then
litigated?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker

sorry.
