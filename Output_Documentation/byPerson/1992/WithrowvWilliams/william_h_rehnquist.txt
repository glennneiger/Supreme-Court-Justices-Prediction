chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1030,
pamela
withrow
v.
robert
allen
williams,
jr.
mr.
caminsky,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
complain
in
the
fifth
circuit,
mr.
caminsky,
about
the
district
court's
taking
up
the
involuntariness
issue
as
well
as
the
miranda
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
caminsky.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
state
courts
must
have
found
that
the
state
carried
the
burden--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they...
that's
a
finding
that
the
state
carried
its
burden,
surely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
orozco
has
been
limited
by
later
cases,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
not
bound
by
all
the
dicta
in
miranda,
surely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
we're
to
rule
against
you
here,
we
would
have
to
say
that
miranda
doesn't
exist
on
federal
habeas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
you
know,
there
are
arguments
pro
and
con,
but
i
don't
see
that
it
turns
on
the
particular
phraseology.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
caminsky,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
caminsky--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1030,
withrow
against
williams
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
