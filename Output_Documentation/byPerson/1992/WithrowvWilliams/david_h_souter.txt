justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
a
very
pragmatic
difference,
though,
because
in
the
fourth
amendment
case,
if
you
preclude
the
litigation
of
these
claims
that's
it,
it's
all
over,
whereas
if
we
preclude
litigation
in
the
miranda
claims
we
then
face
the
voluntariness
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
will
face
that
case
anyway
if
the
miranda
point
is
lost,
but
if
the
miranda
point
is
won,
it
doesn't
face
that
claim--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
the...
i
guess
what
my
question
boils
down
to
is,
assuming
you
win,
every
case
that...
at
least...
and
i'm
talking
on
pragmatic
grounds
here.
every
case
that
would
readily
have
been
disposed
of
will
now
turn
into
a
case
of
much
more
complicated
litigation
over
voluntariness
and
i
question...
even
if
one
were
inclined
to
accept
your
view
in
the
abstract,
i
question
what
we
would
be
gaining
by
it,
or
indeed
losing
by
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
concede
that
in
this
case
there
certainly
is
a
voluntariness
issue
which
will
be
litigated,
is
litigated?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
any
way
of
gauging
the
practical
effect
of
ruling
your
way?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
do
this
based
on
our
own
educated
guesses
from
our
own
backgrounds?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true.
do
you
carry
that
to
the
point
of
saying
we
have
no...
the
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
consider--
justice
david
h.
souter
--miranda
claims?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
want
to
rest
on
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
self-executing
right
can
be
enforced
without
miranda,
you
will
agree
with
that,
won't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
one
could
be
enforced...
for
example,
if
you
go
beyond
voluntariness
to
waiver
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
this
could
be
enforced
simply
by
saying,
we
will
examine
every
question
of
the...
every
issue
on
admissibility
of
a
confession
to
try
to
determine
whether
he
was
aware
of
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
hence
his
speaking
could
be
construed
as
waiving
it.
we
can
do...
that
may
be
a
very
awkward
inquiry,
but
we
can
do
it
without
having
a
miranda
ruling.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
equally
impossible
to
enforce
the
fourth
amendment
without
an
exclusionary
rule?
everybody
knows
that
tort
remedy
doesn't
work.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
the
answer
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
you
can't
enforce
the
fourth
amendment
effectively
without
the
exclusionary
rule,
can
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
respondent,
williams,
brought
this
habeas
actions
challenging
the
legality
of
the
state
convictions
for
murder
and
other
offenses.
williams
alleged
that
the
state
court
had
erred
in
allowing
the
introduction
of
statements
solicited
from
him
by
the
police
in
violation
of
his
right
in
the
miranda
v.
arizona.
the
district
court
agreed
and
granted
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
state's
argument
that
federal
habeas
review
of
williams'
miranda
claim
should
be
barred
under
the
rule
in
stone
and
powell,
which
holds
that
federal
habeas
review
of
fourth
amendment
claims
is
not
available
when
a
state
has
given
a
full
and
fair
chance
to
litigate
such
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
we
affirm
and
hold
at
stone's
restriction
on
the
exercise
of
federal
habeas
jurisdiction
does
not
extend
to
miranda
claims.
the
equitable
considerations
that
formed
the
basis
for
a
decision
in
stone
do
not
obtain
here.
most
importantly,
eliminating
review
of
miranda
claims
would
not
significantly
benefit
the
federal
courts
in
their
exercise
of
habeas
jurisdiction
or
advanced
the
cause
of
federalism
in
any
substantial
way.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
which
the
chief
justice
joins;
justice
scalia
