mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
for
the
last
seven
or
eight
hundred
years,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
one
of
the
crown
jewels
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence,
providing
a
measure
of
protection
for
all
who
share
the
heritage
of
the
english
common
law
from
tyranny
and
oppression.
in
this
case,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we
have
in
front
of
us
today
a
classic
example
of
the
extent
to
which
habeas
corpus
has
strayed
from
its
original
and
intended
purposes
and
gives
us
a
paradigm
of
a
federal
district
court
employing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
a
writ
of
federal
error.
if
we
take
a
look
at
the
record
of
this
case,
we
see
that
before
his
arraignment
respondent
made
three
separate
statements
to
the
police,
the
first
statement
being
severable
into
two
separate
parts,
a
pre-miranda
segment
and
a
post-miranda
segment.
prior
to
trial,
the
respondent
moved
to
suppress
all
three
statements
on
various
grounds
relating
to
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendments,
and
actually
prevailed
concerning
two
of
those
statements.
the
only
statement
that
the
state
trial
judge
admitted
into
evidence
was
the
first
statement
rejecting
the
respondent's
claim
that
it
was
obtained
unlawfully
and
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
in
a
state
court
appeal,
the
respondent
chose
to
appeal
on
matters
relating
to
this
particular
statement
only
on
grounds
related
to
the
miranda
issue.
the
state
court
of
appeals
in
michigan
denied
his
appeal
and
issued
an
opinion
affirming
his
conviction.
the
respondent
then
filed
an
application
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
which
denied
review
and
ultimately
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
which
was
denied
back
in
1989.
respondent
then
went
to
federal
district
court,
filing
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
again,
as
far
as
this
particular
statement
is
concerned,
respondent
raised
only
the
miranda
issue.
in
her
opinion
granting
the
writ,
however,
the
federal
district
judge
not
only
sustained
his
miranda
claim,
in
effect
overruling
the
finding
of
the
state
court
that
the
police
had
done
nothing
wrong,
but
also
went
on
to
find
the
second
half
of
that
statement,
the
post-miranda
statement,
and
actually
both
of
the
other
statements
that
had
been
suppressed
in
the
state
trial
court,
to
be
involuntary.
we
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit,
and
while
finding
parts
of
the
district
court's
opinion
slightly
inexplicable,
the
court
nevertheless
issued
an
opinion
affirming,
and
that
is
what
brings
us
here
today.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
yes,
we
did.
in
fact,
in
the
sixth
circuit
i
tried
to
draw
a
clear
distinction
between
the
miranda
claim
and
a
claim
of
involuntariness.
i
think
there
are
clear
precedents
from
this
court
under
the
quarles
case
and
harris
v.
new
york
and
a
number
of
others
where
this
court
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
miranda
defects
and
miranda
claims
and
claims
of
involuntariness,
and
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
i
tried
to
point
out
in
the
sixth
circuit,
apparently
not
as
well
as
i
would
have
hoped,
because
in
any
event
they
rejected
that
particular
position,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
yes.
we...
in
a
number
of
points
in
our
brief,
what
we
tried
to
do
was
draw
a
distinction
between
the
miranda
claim
and
the
involuntariness
claim,
and
we
even
noted
in
our
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
this
issue
was
not
before
the
district
court
not
only
because
of
the
failure
of
exhaustion
but
because
it
had
never
been
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
so
it
is
a
little
bit
mystifying
how
we
got
to
the
point
of
having
to
argue
both
the
question
of
voluntariness
and
the
question
of
miranda.
the
sixth
circuit,
however,
also
drew
no
distinction
between
the
miranda
claim
and
the
involuntariness
claim,
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
we're
here
to
address
today.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
many
respects
the
narrowest
holding
that
this
court
could
issue,
and
perhaps
the
core
of
this
case,
is
simply
the
application
of
stone
v.
powell
to
miranda
claims,
and
there
are
a
number
of
different
ways
this
court
can
go
about
that.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
yes,
it
is.
i
think
in
terms
of
helping
the
analysis,
it
may
help
us
to
divide
what
we
commonly
consider
to
be
constitutional
claims
into
three
different
classifications,
three
different
classes
of
claimed
constitutional
violations.
the
first
claim
would
be
matters
of
fundamental
fairness.
justice
cardozo
in
palko
v.
connecticut
wrote
a
rather
interesting
opinion
outlining
his
conception
of
what
fundamental
fairness
was,
and
basically
this
court
has
issued
opinions
of
similar
import
in
recent
years.
teague
v.
lane,
for
example,
would
even
apply
retroactive
changes
in
the
law
in
habeas
review
in
certain
cases
relating--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--no.
there
would
still
be
the
miranda
claim
to
deal
with.
i
mean,
the
exhaustion
claim
only
refers
to
the
second
half--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--of
the
statement,
so
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
that
would
be
the--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--okay.
well--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--see,
this
is
one
of
the
points
of
some
confusion
in
the
sixth
circuit.
if
the
court
examines
the
sixth
circuit
appendix
it
will
see
that
the
respondent
in
his
state
court
appeal
appeared
through
his
statement
of
the
question
to
be
raising
only
a
question
of
the
state
constitution.
at
the
time
in
michigan
there
was
a
question
relating
to
focus
and
custody
in
terms
of
triggering
mechanism
for
miranda
warnings,
and
in
large
part
his
argument
in
the
state
court
related
to
that
issue,
and
i
had
originally
challenged
the
miranda
claim
on
the
question
of
exhaustion
as
well.
upon
reflection,
it
seemed
that
there
was
enough
language
in
his
state
court
appellate
brief
to
raise
the
federal
part
of
the
miranda
issue
as
well,
and
therefore
i
think
that
part
of
it
is
exhausted.
but
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--yes,
i
do,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
i
mean,
part
of
the
reason
is
because
of
the
particular
classification
that
miranda
would
fall
into,
and
we
have
questions
of
fundamental
fairness
of
basic
due
process.
there's
another
class
that
i
would
consider
to
be
the
federal
criminal
constitutional
procedural-type
guarantees
that
this
court
has
adopted
through
its
incorporation
document.
the
last
class
would
be
constitutional
claims
relating
to
rules
of
deterrence,
or
rules
of
peripheral
access,
and
that
is
the
type
of
claim
that
miranda
is,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
take
the
logic
of
stone
v.
powell
and
apply
it
to
the
particular
fact
situations
that
are
likely
to
occur
in
a
miranda
case,
that
the
legal
parallels
are
rather
compelling.
and
in
fact,
as
justice
o'connor
noted
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
duckworth,
it
seems
to
be
even
more
compelling
in
the
miranda
context
because
we're
not
really
dealing
with
an
actual
violation
of
the
constitution,
we're
simply
dealing
with
a
violation
of
the
rule
that
this
court
has
designed
to
create
a
buffer
around
the
actual
constitutional
violation.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
well,
this
court
has--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--the
federal
court
is
likely
to
wind
up
having
to
face
that
claim
anyway.
in
my
experience,
it
is
the--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
reasonable
minds
can
differ
in
terms
of
our
perception
of
the
practical
benefits.
in
my
experience,
it
seems
that
defendants
are
always
raising
both
issues.
they
tend
to
treat
them
as
twins
and
see
how
the
factual
record
develops
and
argue
the
point
from
there.
it
seems--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--there
was
a
voluntariness
issue
that
could
have
been
litigated.
if
the
court,
however,
examines
the
record
and
examines
the
tapes,
it
will
see
we
are
not
talking
about
the
kind
of
voluntariness
issue
that
we
discussed...
the
court
discussed
in
mincey,
for
example,
or
in
brown
v.
mississippi,
where
you're
talking
about
actual...
overt
acts
of
physical
coercion.
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
voluntariness
issue,
it
is
rather...
rather
odd
that
it
not
only
passed
by
the
defense
attorneys
in
the
state
court,
but
it
completely
escaped
the
attention
of
anybody
up
until
it
was
raised
sua
sponte
by
the
federal
district
judge.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
probably.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
particular
studies.
my
own
sense
is
that
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
miranda
claims,
but
in
any
event,
if
the
court
looks
to
the
text
of
the
habeas
statute
it
does
not
talk
about
issuing
the
writ
in
cases
where
there
is
a
violation
of
a
prophylactic
rule.
it
limits
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
to
cases
involving
the
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
well--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--i
think
that
a
very
strong
argument
can
be
made
along
those
lines.
i
think
there's
a
different
question
to
be
raised--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--no.
i
think
there's
a...
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
direct
appeal
and
habeas
review.
i
mean,
habeas
review
historically
has
been
a
rather
limited
mechanism
for
correcting
fundamental
injustice,
and
in
this
type
of
case,
if
you
are
dealing
with
miranda
claims
you
are
not
necessarily
dealing
with
a
fundamental
injustice.
as
justice
o'connor
noted
in
her
opinion,
the
mere
failure
to
give
warnings
does
not
render
evidence
inherently
suspect
or
inherently
unreliable.
in
addition,
we
permit
the
use
of
miranda-defective
confessions
for
impeachment
purposes
and
for
a
variety
of
other
purposes
as
well,
so
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
class
of
evidence
that
is
by
its
nature
excludable,
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
limited
class
of
evidence
that
creates
a
buffer
around
the
actual
core
constitutional
right
that's
involved.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
where
the
federal
court's
warrant
is
not
to
sit
in
review
of
what
the
state
court
did
but
to
try
to
search
the
record,
trying
to
examine
for
fundamental
injustice,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
going
to...
that
should
be
the
responsibility
of
a
habeas
court.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
i
think
it
very
well
may
in
a
number
of
different
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
oh,
i
don't
believe
that
any
real
civilized
system
of
justice
could
rely
on
involuntary
confessions
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
in
certain
cases,
your
honor.
i
mean,
what
the
miranda
rules
do
is
create
a
buffer
around
the
right.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
well,
neither,
strictly
speaking,
does
a
miranda
violation.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
well,
it
can
in
a
certain
case.
anyway,
perhaps
i
can
make
the
point
better
by
way
of
illustration.
we
have
a
65-mile-an-hour
speed
limit
on
most
interstates,
and
if
that
is
what
the
law
is
supposed
to
be,
if
the
police
decide
that
that
law
is
so
important
that
they
simply
do
not
wish
to
allow
anybody
to
exceed
the
speed
limit,
if
they
adopt
a
rule
that
they'll
issue
tickets
every
time
somebody
goes
more
than
40
miles
an
hour,
you're
going
to
have
a
great
number
of
people
who
are
issued
tickets
for
exceeding
the
de
facto
40-mile-an-hour
speed
limit
but
never
actually
reach
the
status
of
a
violation
of
the
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
miranda
case...
the
miranda
rule
deals
with
situations
falling
in
that
buffer
as
between
the
40
and
65-mile-an-hour
range.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
well--
[laughter]
sorry,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
if
there
are
any
further
questions
i'll
be
glad
to
respond
to
them.
otherwise
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
just
a
few
brief
points
in
rebuttal.
counsel
for
respondent
has
questioned
whether
this
court
really
can
or
should
limit
miranda
claims
on
habeas
review.
i
would
simply
cite
this
court
to
28
u.s.c.
2243,
which
authorizes
the
habeas
court
to
dispose
of
the
matter
as
law
and
justice
require.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
concludes
that
it
is
a
better
use
of
the
federal
judiciary's
time
not
to
delve
into
the
technical
aspects
of
the
miranda
claim
on
habeas
but
simply
to
delve
into
the
very
heart
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
try
to
prevent
any
sort
of
fundamental
injustice
involving
involuntariness,
that
is
certainly
within
this
court's
power.
i
think
brother
counsel
and
i
may
disagree
about
whether
that
would
be
a
wise
thing
to
do,
but
i
think
this
court
certainly
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
counsel
also
mentioned
the
four
federal
judges
who've
considered
this,
and
their
conclusion
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
i
would
not
want
this
court
to
look...
to
overlook
the
20
judges
on
direct
appellate
review,
the
20
judicial
officers
who
passed
on
the
miranda
claim
and
found
that
it...
found
it
to
be
meritless.
i
think
that
essentially
goes
to
the
heart
of
why
miranda
claims
do
not
belong
on
federal
habeas
review.
a
habeas
petitioner,
if
he
has
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
or
if
the
opportunity
for
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
state
court,
and
has
lost--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
no,
not
on
this
issue.
the
issue
that
they
were
divided
on--
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
--was
the
question
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
there
was
some
question
about
whether
a
plea
offer
had
been
conveyed
to
the
defendant,
and
that's
the
issue
that
caused
the
dissent.
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
yes,
it
did,
and
this
court
denied
cert
without...
without
a
dissenting
justice
as
well.
lastly,
brother
counsel
has
made
the
point,
or
has
made
the
assertion
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
exist
on
federal
habeas
review.
that
is
simply
incorrect.
what
is
true
is
that
on
habeas
review
this
court's
inquiry
into
fourth
amendment
concerns
is
limited
to
whether
there
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing
of
the
matter
in
the
state
courts.
if
the
court
finds
that
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
fully
litigate
the
matter
and
that
the
petitioner's
other
due
process
rights
were
not
violated,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter,
but
if
it
finds
that
for
one
reason
or
another
the
petitioner
was
precluded
from
raising
the
fourth
amendment
claim
in
the
state
court,
then
it
simply
goes
on
and
uses
the
mechanism
congress
has
established
resolving
the
claim
on
the
merits.
lastly,
i
would
simply
remind
the
court
there
doesn't
really
seem
to
be
any
disagreement
between
brother
counsel
and
myself
that
miranda
does
sweep
more
broadly
than
the
constitution.
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
o'connor's
point
was
absolutely
correct,
once
the
matter
passes
through
the
state
appellate
system
and
we
get
to
the
federal
habeas
court,
this
court
should
be
concerned
not
with
the
technical
rules,
not
with
the
rules
at
the
periphery
of
all
these
amendments,
but
rather
with
the
core
constitutional
right
that
is
involved
here,
and
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
that
right
would
be
the
question
of
involuntariness.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
jeffrey
caminsky
thank
you.
