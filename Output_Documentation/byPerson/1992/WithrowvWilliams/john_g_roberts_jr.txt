chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
believes
that
the
rule
of
stone
v.
powell
should
apply
to
bar
the
assertion
of
miranda
claims
on
habeas
corpus
if
the
habeas
petitioner
has
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
raise
the
claim
in
state
court
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
rule
bars
the
assertion
of
exclusionary
rule
claims
on
habeas
corpus.
like
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
requirement
of
miranda
warnings
is
an
extraconstitutional,
judicially-created
rule.
just
as
the
exclusionary
rule
bars
the
admission
of
probative
evidence
to
deter
fourth
amendment
violations,
miranda
bars
the
admission
of
probative
statements
to
deter
fifth
amendment
violations,
and
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
court
in
miranda
explained
its
adoption
of
the
extraconstitutional
rule
as
a
means
of
vindicating
fifth
amendment
interests.
we're
not
here
challenging
the
application
of
miranda
at
trial
or
on
direct
review.
we
just
think
that
the
purposes
of
the
rule
have
to
be
assessed
in
the
habeas
context,
just
as--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
have
a
position
on
that,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
don't
challenge
its
application
in
trial
or
on
direct
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
do
think
the
phrase,
constitution
laws
and
treaties,
laws
can
include
both
statutes
and
judicially-created
constitutional
common
law,
as
it
were.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
yes,
and
as
the
court
explained
in
stone
that
there's
little
additional
deterrent
effect
from
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
on
habeas
corpus,
so,
too,
there
is
little,
if
any,
additional
deterring
effect
from
applying
miranda.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
we
agree
with
that.
we
don't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered.
this
goes
to
justice
souter's
question.
we
think
there's
a
very
significant
gain
from
excluding
miranda
from
habeas
corpus.
this
court
knows
from
its
own
miranda
jurisprudence
that
cases
under
miranda
can
present
very
difficult
technical
issues...
the
content
of
the
warnings,
when
they're
triggered,
how
they
apply
to
subsequent
arrests.
in
cases
that
the
court
knows
seldom
present
serious
issues
of
voluntariness
under
the
fifth
amendment,
extending
stone
to
miranda
would
keep
those
technical
and
difficult
issues
out
of
habeas
corpus,
issues
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence,
while
leaving
only
voluntariness
claims
under
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
a
significant
gain.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
as
this
court
knows
from
cases
like
duckworth
and
some
of
the
other
cases
like
prysock,
i
don't
think
there's
any
great
distinction.
how
they
apply
in
subsequent
interviews,
when
they
can
be
reinitiated,
what's
the
exact
content,
as
was
the
issue
in
this
case,
when
are
the
requirements
or
the
warnings
triggered,
they're
very
difficult.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
miranda
has
been...
i
guess
could
be
described
as
a
bright
line
rule,
but
i
think
the
court
has
found
that
it's
not
so
bright
on
application.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
looks
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
determine--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
under
miller
v.
fenton
it
is
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--de
novo
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
particular
cases
it
may
be,
but
i
suppose
that,
when
you
mentioned,
justice
souter,
the
practical
effect,
i
think
what
the
assumption
is
that
a
prisoner
is
going
to
sort
of
raise
a
claim
even
if
it's
frivolous,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
it's
an
operation
that
the
courts
have
to
undertake
now
in
any
event.
this
isn't
going
to
be
an
additional--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that
is
the
end
of
it,
yes,
on
direct
review,
and
the
question
is
what
happens
on
habeas
corpus.
we're
suggesting
that's
going
to
be
the
end
of
it
if
our
rule's
accepted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
does
a...
on
the
record--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
have
any
statistics
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
much
smaller--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--most
don't
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
is
what's
been
described
as
constitutional
common
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
no,
i
don't.
i
think
the
key
distinction
that
the
respondent
has
suggested
between
the
exclusionary
rule
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
miranda's
exclusionary
rule
is
that
the
exclusionary
rule
doesn't
prevent
a
constitutional
violation
from
occurring.
that's
complete
upon
the
illegal
search
and
seizure.
miranda,
on
the
other
hand,
respondent
argues,
prevents
a
constitutional
violation
from
even
occurring,
and
is
therefore
worth
pursuing
even
on
habeas
corpus.
that,
i
think,
begs
the
question.
it
assumes
there's
a
fifth
amendment
violation
to
be
deterred,
to
be
prevented.
as
this
court
has
explained,
a
violation
of
miranda
is
not
the
same
as
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
once
that's
understood,
the
distinction
cuts
the
other
way.
the
exclusionary
rule,
after
all,
prevents
the
state
from
taking
advantage
of
a
constitutional
violation
in
every
case
in
which
it
applies.
miranda
sweeps
more
broadly
than
the
constitution,
so
we
think
the
rule
of
stone
v.
powell
should
apply
a
fortiori,
and
with
respect
to
the
significance,
the
practical
impact,
it's
noteworthy
i
think
that
36
state
attorneys
general
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
suggesting
that
they
regard
the
impact
as
significant
in
terms
of
the
respect
accorded
by
the
federal
system
to
the
finality
of
state
court
judgments.
now,
turning
to
the
voluntariness
question
in
this
case,
the
statements
that
were
made
after
the
miranda
warnings
were
given
and
waived,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
shows
this:
we
had
a
lucid
individual
not
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol,
not
too
young
to
be
susceptible
to
police
influence,
a
veteran
of
police
procedures...
he
knew
the
jargon.
he
testified
that
he
had
six
prior
b&e's.
police
taped
the
interview,
not
something
they're
likely
to
do
if
they're
embarked
on
a
campaign
to
overbear
his
will,
and
of
course,
as
noted,
miranda
warnings
had
been
given.
now,
in
that
circumstance,
what
is
it
that
makes
respondent's
statements
involuntary
in
response
to
this
promise
of
leniency?
not
that...
it
was
but-for
cause.
brady
tells
us
that
that's
not
enough.
not
that
it
was
a
promise
of
leniency.
fulminante
made
clear
that
statements
in
bram
suggesting
that
was
enough
were
no
longer
good
law.
not
that
there
was
any
possibility
that
this
would
generate
a
false
admission
of
guilt.
this
isn't
a
case,
you
know,
confess
and
we'll
release
your
spouse
or
your
child.
in
fact,
the
only
condition
he
had
to
meet
was
to
tell
the
truth.
nor
is
there
anything
improper
about
the
inducement
that
was
offered
in
this
case.
it
wasn't,
as
in
fulminante,
talk
and
we'll
save
you
from
a
beating.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
well,
assuming
the
court
disagrees
with
the
exhaustion
point...
we
haven't
briefed
the
exhaustion
point.
we
have
looked
at
the
record.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
voluntariness,
the
promise
of
leniency
as
opposed
to
miranda--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--was
not
raised
in
the
state
system
on
appeal,
and
therefore
could
be
considered
not
to
be
exhausted,
but
if
it
is
exhausted
i
do
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
record's
very
ambiguous
in
the
sixth
circuit
about
whether
there
was
a
concession
to
that
effect
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
promise
of
leniency
point
was
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
habeas
petition
mentioned
solely
the
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings.
the
promise--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
district
court
went
on
to
reach
it
and
decide
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
there
was
no
trial
proceeding.
the...
it
was
mentioned
at
the
suppression
hearing
in
state
court,
and
then
i
think
not
mentioned
any
further,
and
then
it
reemerged
in
the
district
court's
opinion
and
that
was
the
first
point
at
which
it
resurfaced.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
yes,
but
i
think
the
court
can
reach
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
court
can
reach
it,
since
it
was
decided
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
whether
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
to
reach
it
is
a
different
question,
and
i
think
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
as
well
as--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
issue
did
come
in
as
a
surprise
in
the
district
court
opinion,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
