what
does
this
prove?
justice
white
well,
what
if
he
did...
what
if
the
defendant
just
did
business
out
of
his
house,
the
drug
business
out
of
his
house?
justice
white
then
no
proportionality?
justice
white
yes,
but
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
this
forfeiture
was
done
after
a
finding
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
justice
white
well,
why
don't
we
talk
about
the
case
like
that?
you'd
still
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
white
have
you
got
any
cases
on
your
side?
justice
white
have
you
got
any
cases
applying
it
to
the...
to
civil
cases?
justice
white
but
it
applied
the
eighth
amendment
anyway.
justice
white
have
you
got
any
state
supreme
court
cases
on
your
side?
justice
white
or
under
their
own
constitutions?
justice
white
if
we
thought
it
was
punishment,
do
you
lose?
justice
white
if
we
thought
this
was
punishment,
this
amounted
to
punishment,
would
you
lose?
justice
white
but
you
would
say,
however,
that
if
it
is
punishment,
it
is...
the
eighth
amendment
is
applicable
to
civil
cases.
justice
white
does
it
have
to
be
some
connection
with
a
criminal
case?
justice
white
do
you
think
historically
the
excessive
fines
notion
applied
at
all
in
civil
cases?
justice
white
so,
the
answer
historically
would
be
if
a
fine
is
payable
to
the
sovereign
as
a
fine,
if
it's
as
punishment,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
it's
a
civil
case.
justice
white
so,
what
if
we
say
that
we
think
this
is
punishment
contrary
to
your
belief?
is
there
any
difference
between
saying
it's
an
excessive
fine
or
it's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
white
so,
what
would
be
the
standard
under
the
excessive
fines
route
if
we
said,
well,
this
is
punishment,
and
so
the
excessive
fines
clause
applies?
justice
white
so,
you
do
say
that
the
standard
would
be
roughly
the
same--
justice
white
but
all
that
analysis,
mr.
estrada,
proceeds
from
the
line
of
cases
that
essentially
began
with
forfeitures
in
the
maritime
area
and
forfeitures
of
certain
kind
of
chattel.
but
isn't
it
true
that
at
early
common
law,
one
of
the
benefits,
at
least
to
the
nobles,
of
classifying
certain
crimes
as
felony
was
so
that
they
could
have
forfeiture.
forfeiture
was
intricately
bound
up
with
the
definition
of
crime
at
a
very
early
english
law,
was
it
not?
justice
white
would
the
answer
on
proportionality
be
different
if
it
was
600
grams
instead
of
2?
justice
white
even
though
he's
deprived
of
his
entire
livelihood.
