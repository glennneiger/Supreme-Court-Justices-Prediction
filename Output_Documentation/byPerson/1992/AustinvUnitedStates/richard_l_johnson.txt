mr.
richard
l.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
eighth
amendment
and
specifically
the
excessive
fines
clause
applies
to
the
concept
of...
applies
to
the
civil
forfeiture
under
21
u.s.c.,
section
881(a)(4)
and
(a)(7).
mr.
richard
lyle
austin
is
the
owner
of
the
garretson
body
shop
and
also
the
1972
mobile
home
that
were
seized
by
the
government
under
the...
these
appropriate
statutes.
the
facts
of
the
case
show
that
he
transferred
2
grams
of
cocaine
to
someone
in
the
body
shop,
and
that
he
obtained
this
from
the
mobile
home.
a
subsequent
search
of
the
mobile
home
and
body
shop
indicated
there
were
small
amounts
of
cocaine,
some
paraphernalia,
and
some
small
amounts
of
marijuana.
mr.
austin
pled
guilty
in
state
court.
he
was
sentenced
to
7
years.
the
government
seized
his
mobile
home
and
his
body
shop,
which
was
his
livelihood,
and
he
had
been
in
the
auto
body
shop
for
about
25
years.
the
affidavit
in
the
record
indicates
he
intended
to
return
to
that
job,
that
type
of
living,
the
body-shop
living,
when
he
got
out
of
prison.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
reluctantly
affirmed
indicating
that
the
technical
legal
distinctions
regarding
in
personam
and
in
rem
prohibited
it
from
reaching
the
issue
of
the
eighth
amendment
applicability.
it
also
indicated
that
clear
court
decisions
by
this
court
and
other
courts
do
not
require
proportionality
in
the
civil
proceedings
for
the
forfeiture
of
property.
i
want
to
make
three
points
in
this
oral
argument.
first
is
that
where
the
government
stands
to
gain
monetarily
the
excessive
fines
clause
should
apply
and
eighth
amendment
proportionality
should
apply.
secondly,
the
in
rem
fiction
shouldn't
bar
the
application
of
the
excessive
fines/proportionality
analysis
when
the
civil
forfeitures
are
quasi-criminal
or
punishment
in
actual
character.
thirdly,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
halper
and
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez,
those
tests
actually
show
that
this
civil
forfeiture
is
punishment.
first
of
all,
regarding
the
first
point,
the
court's
decision
in
browning
v.
ferris
provides
a
basis
for
applying
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fines
clause
to
civil
actions
and
to
forfeitures.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
you
indicated
that
you
rejected
the
application
to
actions
between
private
parties.
you
left
open
the
possibility
that
when
the
government
is
involved,
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
could
also
be
applicable.
and,
in
fact,
you
suggested
in,
i
think,
a
footnote
quoting
halper
that
it
might
give
rise
to
the
eighth
amendment
analysis
when
the
government
stood
to
gain
punitive
damages.
and
in
justice
o'connor's
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion,
there
was
a
substantial
analysis
of
the
historical
development
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
and
the
fact
that
fines
and
forfeitures
are
equivalent,
and
that,
in
fact,
the
eighth
amendment
should
apply
to
civil
actions.
your
quote
in
browning
v.
ferris
regarding
the
court
of
vermont
also
indicated...
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
also
indicated
that
in
certain
circumstances
you
felt
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
or
the
eighth
amendment
could
be
applicable.
in
your
case
harmelin
v.
michigan,
justice
scalia's
footnote
also
indicated
that
it
makes
sense
to
scrutinize
governmental
action
more
closely
when
the
state
stands
to
benefit.
it's
clear
that
under
21
u.s.c.
881(a)(4)
and
(a)(7),
the
government
has
stood
to
benefit.
we
cite
in
our
brief
an
article
from
newsweek
which
indicates
that
since
1985
the
government
has
obtained
about
$2.6
billion
through
this
forfeiture
proceeding.
there's
also
a
quote
by
the
director
of
the
asset
forfeiture
branch
of
the
attorney
general's
office.
it
says
that
civil
forfeiture
is
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
egg.
there's
another
quote
also
that
we
indicate
from
a
american
criminal
law
review
article
in
which
it
indicates
that
in
august
of
1990,
the
u.s.
attorney
general
warned
u.s.
attorneys
that
the
department
was
far
short
of
its
projected
$470
million
in
forfeiture
deposits
and
urged
them
to
increase
the
efforts
in
order
to
make
the
budget
goal
during
fiscal
year
1990.
and
this
was
in
august
of
1990,
and
mr.
austin's
property--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
it
shows
i
think
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
check
on
the
government,
just
as
justice
scalia
says
it
makes
sense
to
scrutinize
government
actions
more
closely.
what
it
indicates
is
that
there
is
a
possibility
for
overreaching.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
think
that
the
constitution
protects
individuals
from
government
overreaching
if
that
happens,
if
there's
a
possibility
of
it.
and
there
is
the
possibility
of
it
under
this
forfeiture
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
no.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
calero-toledo
needs
to
be
distinguished
and
possibly
even
looked
at
again
i
think.
number
one,
in--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
calero-toledo,
the
eighth
amendment
wasn't
raised.
that
would
be
one
point.
secondly,
although
calero-toledo
indicates,
as
you
said,
that
in
rem
forfeiture
really
shouldn't
deal
with
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
owner,
in
fact,
it
does
establish
an
innocent
owner
exception.
and
thirdly,
forfeitures
at
the
time
of
calero-toledo
weren't
the
same
as
they
are
now.
the
forfeitures
that
the
government
is
having
under
21
u.s.c.
881
(a)(4)
and
(a)(7)
are
far
in
excess
of
what
was
happening
back
at
the
time
of
calero-toledo.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
think
that
in
rem
forfeiture
under
common
law
and
as...
at
the
time
that
the
framers
knew
it
is
different
than
the
forfeiture
that
we're
experiencing
today.
i
think
that
the
cases
established
that
in
rem
forfeiture
at
that
time
was
against
ships,
dealt
with
piracy,
dealt
with
violations
of
the
customs
laws--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--which
are
instrumentalities...
which
can
be
instrumentalities
of
drug
use,
but
when
it
comes
to
someone's
home
or
in
this
case
the
business,
these
were
incidental,
in
effect,
to
the
drug
use.
in
other
words,
he
could
have
transferred
this
drug
use
anywhere,
outside,
in
somebody's
place.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
if
there
was...
if
the
house
was
used
specifically
for
that
purpose,
if
it
was...
if
there
was
a
history--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--then
there
should
be
proportionality,
but
it
should
be
analyzed
under
a
series
of
factors.
that's
what
proportionality
is
as
we
advocate
it.
there
should
be
many
factors
or
several
factors
that
are
applied,
factors
such
as
the
circuit
courts
have
applied
in
criminal
forfeiture
cases
in
order
to
determine
whether
all
of
the
property
should
be
forfeited,
whether
some
of
it
should
be
forfeited,
or
whether
none
of
it
should
be.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
yes,
it
does.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
believe
that's
true,
yes.
i
think
that's
an
example
of
why
it
is
a
punitive
sanction
because
you
do
have
the
innocent
owner
defenses
in
both
(a)(4)
and
(a)(7).
we
are
asking
that
the
court
apply
proportionality
analysis
to
someone
who
is
not
innocent
like
mr.
austin.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
think
that...
first
of
all,
i
think
congress
in
a
sense
has
enacted
that
type
of
law
under
(a)(4).
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
that's
correct.
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
i
think
that
would
depend
on--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--it
could
depend
on
the
cases.
i
guess
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
that's
what
i
would
say.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
it
can
be
in
rem,
but
it
can
also
be
punishment.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
it
would--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--it
certainly
would
be
punishment
then,
yes.
obviously--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--if
the
owner
has
not
engaged
in
punishable
conduct--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
if
the
owner
had
not
done
anything
wrong
and
yet
had
the
property
seized
and
forfeited,
then
obviously--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--that
certainly
would
be
punishment
to
that
particular
person.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
if
the
person
has
done
nothing
wrong
it
seems
like,
then
it
would
be
punishment
if
the
person
would
have
their
assets
taken.
i
guess
that's
what
i
would
say.
the
excessive
fines
clause
also
should
apply
because
the
government
is
able
to
use
this
forfeiture
procedure
without
the
traditional
safeguards,
procedural
safeguards,
that
would
apply
in
most
criminal
cases.
the
government
needs
only
to
establish
probable
cause.
it
can
establish
hearsay
evidence,
and
then
the
claimant
has
the
burden
to
prove
the
claimant's
innocence
or
some
other
defense
that
might
be
applicable
in
the
case.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
that's
true,
yes.
and
the
reason
is
because--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--yes,
i
would.
there
was
guilt
in
this
case.
he
pled
guilty,
and
yet
his
involvement
was
relatively
minor.
at
least
that's
what
the
record
seems
to
indicate.
and
yet,
he
lost
his
home
and
he
lost
his
business,
a
business
that
he
had
been
involved
in...
not
that
particular
place,
but
he
has
been
involved
in
that
business
for
25
years.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
that's
true,
you
did.
and
i
think
you
felt
that
the
states
obviously
had
the
right
to
enact
laws
that
were
like
that.
and
the
other
thing
is,
though--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--yes,
that's
true,
and...
but
the
amount
of
drugs
in
that
case
was
600
and
some
grams
i
believe
too.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
only
2
grams,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
well,
i
think
the
statute
probably
allows
that,
but
that
never
would
have
happened.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
think
one
could
argue
that
that
would
be
an
excessive
fine
for
someone
that...
who
is
in
forma
pauperis.
in
my
experience
representing
persons
who
are...
under
court
appointment,
the
fine
provision
is
never
used
because
they
are
not
able
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
usually
i
think
it
would...
usually,
at
least
in
my
experience,
the
fine
is
not
imposed
if
the
person
is
not
able
to
pay
it.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
right.
there
are
a
couple
grams
involved.
this
was
a
first
offense
for
him.
he
lost
his
business,
which
was
his
means
to
earn
a
living,
and
he
lost
his
home.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
think
that's
a
factor,
but
also
we're
asking
the
court
to
take
into
consideration
the
other
factors,
that
someone
who
has
lost
everything
they
have
for
a
relatively
minor
offense--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--it
is
harmful
to
society,
and
the...
certainly
the
government
has
to
have
laws
which
help
it
in
its
war
on
drugs.
but
the
other
thing
that's
true
is
that
the
full
weight
of
the
war
on
drugs
shouldn't
be
visited
on
one
person
for
this
particular
offense.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
well,
that's
true,
but
this
person
lost
everything
because
of
it.
so,
from
his
point
of
view,
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
alluded
to,
he
lost
everything
that
he
had.
in
a
sense,
from
his
point
of
view,
it
has
been
visited
on
him.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
that's
true.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
well,
i
think
the
halper
case
is
on
our
side,
at
least
as
far
as
the
punishment
issue.
we're
arguing
mainly
that
the
eighth
amendment
should
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
the
whalers
cove
case
from
the
second
circuit
applies
it,
although
the
whalers
cove
case
on
the
facts
finds
that
it
does
not
apply.
and
strictly
speaking
i
guess
it
was
an
eighth
amendment
application.
it
said
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
argument
had
been
abandoned.
so,
it
applied
i
think
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
and
found
that
under
the
proportionality
analysis
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
it
applies
the
eighth
amendment
yes.
but
as
far
as
the
excessive
fines
clause,
it
doesn't.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
instructive
on
that
issue.
this
would
be
the
first
case
that
really
the
court
has
had
to
decide
that
applies
the
excessive
fines
clause
to
this
type
of--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--no,
not
that
have
applied
the
excessive
fines
clause.
no.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
no.
the
halper
case
indicates
that
a
civil
sanction
that
cannot
fairly
be
said
solely
to
serve
a
remedial
purpose,
but
rather
can
be
explained
only
as
also
serving
either
retributive
or
deterrent
purposes,
punishment,
as
we
have
come
to
understand
the
term.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
civil
forfeiture
serves
a
retributive
or
deterrent
purpose
in
addition
to
whatever
remedial
purpose
it
might
serve.
because
it
also
serves
that,
it's
punishment
within
the...
under
the
understanding
of
that
term.
because
it
is
punishment,
the
excessive
fines
clause
should
apply.
the
in
rem/in
personam
distinction
also
should
not
bar
the
court
from
considering
this
issue.
the
court's
past
cases,
first
of
all,
are
instructive.
one
1958
plymouth
sedan,
boyd
v.
the
united
states,
u.s.
v.
coin
and...
u.s.
v.
u.s.
coin
and
currency
all
see
through
the
in
rem/in
personam
distinction
and
apply
the
fourth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
protections
to
in
rem
actions.
the
statute
themselves,
as
i
indicated,
establish
that
this
is
punishment
rather
than
just
remedial.
they
have
innocent
owner
exceptions.
they're
tied
to
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law
punishable
by
more
than
one
year's
imprisonment.
there
are
procedures
for
remission
or
mitigation
of
forfeiture,
and
they
are
based
on
violations
of
the
controlled
substances
act.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
yes,
that
was
one
of
the--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
i
guess
i'd
argue
that
the
body
shop
and
the
mobile
home
were
not
instrumentalities.
they
weren't
specifically
structured
or
designed
for
this
type
of
drug
use.
in
other
words,
there
wasn't
a
manufacturing
plant
in
there.
there
weren't
secret
compartments.
they
weren't--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--i
think
that
in
those
cases
too,
though,
that
the
item
was
specifically
used
to
store
drugs
and
it
was
used
to
transport
drugs.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
not--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
i
guess
i'm
arguing
that
the
excessive
fines
clause
should
apply
to
this
forfeiture
whether
the
person
is
guilty
or
innocent.
it's
the
actions
of
the
government
i
think
that
should
be
scrutinized
under
the
excessive
fines
clause.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
don't
think
guilt
is
irrelevant.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
factors.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
well,
i
don't
know.
i
guess
i
think
that
the--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--that's
true,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
don't
know.
i
guess
again
it
depends
on
what
the
court
sees,
the
different
factors.
but
if
a
person
is
innocent
and
hasn't
done
anything,
well
then
certainly
that
should
be
a
defense.
it
should
be
something
the
court
should
consider
in
deciding
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
to
forfeit
property
or
not.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
that's
true.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
yes,
that's
true,
especially
if
the
property
is
used...
has
a
specific
purpose
in
advancing
the
drug
business.
if
it's
specifically
designed,
for
example,
to
hide
contraband
or
if
it's
specifically
used
for
nothing
but
the
drug
use,
then--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--i
would
say
that's
true,
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
think
that's
one
of
the
factors
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
i
guess;
that
among
other
factors,
one
of
the
factors
should
be
is
this
property
used
all
the
time
for
illegal
purposes
or
is
its
use
incidental
to
the
particular
use...
illegal
use.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
believe
that
proceeds
of
illegal
activity...
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
well,
this
is
not
proceeds
or
instrumentalities
i
would
say
because
these--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--because
it's
under
the
right
to
forfeit
homes
and
conveyances
and
businesses,
real
property,
whether
it's--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--yes,
but
i
would
argue
that
it's
not
an
instrumentality
because
it
hasn't
been
specifically
adapted
for
that
use,
that
it's...
the
fact
that
it
was
done
in
that
particular
place
was
incidental
to
it.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
would
say
that
those
particular
items
would
be
more
likely
to
be
forfeited
than
something
that
had
some
legitimate
use.
i
guess
that's
where
this
analysis
would
come
into
play,
this
factor
analysis.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
if
it's
always
used
for...
i
guess
that
kind
of
depends
on
what
the
property
is,
though.
if,
let's
say
someone
again
has
lost
everything
they
have,
if
it's
their
business
or
something
like
that,
and
if
it's
not
used,
well
then
maybe
there
would
be
an
argument
that
it
should
not
be
forfeited.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
that's
true.
if
the
sole
use
is
illegal,
then
it
should
be
forfeited,
yes.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
thank
you,
your
honor.
counsel
for
the
government
talks
about
the
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez
criteria.
applying
that
criteria
to
this
case,
it's
clear
that
the
actions
of
the
government
in
this
case
do
constitute
punishment.
first
is
whether
it
creates
an
affirmative
disability
or
restraint.
obviously,
the
loss
of
mr.
austin's
business
and
his
home
was
a
disability
on
him.
whether
it
historically
has
been
regarded
as
punishment.
we'd
argue
that
this
type
of
forfeiture
that
occurred
in
this
case
has
historically
been
regarded
as
punishment
because
we
argue
that
it
goes
back
to
the
time
of
the
framers
and
prior
to
that
what
they
understood
as
punishment
to
be.
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
i
would
argue
that
that
would
be
a
more...
that
would
be
a
factor
which
would
be
more
detrimental
to
mr.
austin,
obviously,
yes.
yes.
the
answer--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--if
it
was
600
grams,
there's
more
of
a
chance
that
probably
the
place
was
being
used
to
store
drugs
too.
that
very
likely
could
be
the
case,
but
again,
that's
a...
it's
a...
an
analysis
that
has
to
be
determined
i
think
by
the
court
in
the
first
instance,
by
the
district
court.
in
other
words,
all
the
factors
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
third
factor
is
whether
it
comes
into
play
on
a
finding
of
scienter.
in
this
case,
the
statutes
themselves
indicate
that
scienter
is
a
factor.
in
other
words,
if
the
owner
does
not
know
of
the
drug
use,
then
it's
a
defense.
four,
whether
the
operation
will
promote
the
traditional
aims
of
punishment,
retribution,
and
deterrence.
in
fact,
that
is
the
case
here
too.
this
civil
forfeiture
under
21
u.s.c.
881(a)(4)
and
(a)(7)
does
promote--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--i
don't
think
i'm
saying
that.
i
guess--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--yes,
that's
true.
yes.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
richard
l.
johnson
--well,
one
of
the
factors
of
whether
or
not
it's
punishment
is
whether
or
not
scienter
is
involved,
and
that...
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
are
an
innocent
owner,
then
that
is
a
defense
to
the
civil
forfeiture.
so,
that's...
that
is
one
of
the
factors
in
this
case.
next,
whether
the
behavior
to
which
it
applies
is
already
a
crime.
as
i
indicated,
the
statutes
do
tie
the
civil
forfeiture
to
the
violations
of
the
controlled
drug
statutes.
and
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
