what
difference
does
it
make
how
much
money
you're
talking
about
if
it's
money
being
taken
from
an
innocent
person?
how
can
disproportionality
have
any
meaning
once
you
acknowledge
that
the
car
or
the
ship
or
the
facility
that
belongs
to
a
totally
innocent
person
may
be
taken?
even
if
it's
only
worth
$100,
that's
vastly
disproportionate
to
his
guilt.
i
assume
proportionality
means
proportional
to
guilt.
justice
scalia
but
all
these
in
rem
things
at
common
law
could
be
imposed
against
a
totally
innocent
person.
i
think...
doesn't
that
conclusively
establish
that
there's
no
proportionality
requirement
for
in
rem
takings?
justice
scalia
cars.
justice
scalia
you
mean,
if...
let's
assume
you
have
a
good,
old...
the
most
old-fashioned
old-fashioned
in
rem
forfeiture
statute
around.
you
forfeit
the
ship
if
it's
used
for
contraband.
if
congress
should
enact
a...
an
amendment
to
that
statute
that
says,
however,
if
the
ship
belongs
to
an
innocent
person
who
didn't
know
it
was
being
used
for
contraband,
it
shall
not
be
forfeited.
that
would
convert
it
to
no
longer
a
classic
in
rem
forfeiture
and
thereafter
it
would
be
subject
to
a
proportionality
requirement.
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
since
an
innocent
person
gets
off
in
this
one,
we
should
impose
the
proportionality
requirement
because
that
renders
it
punishment,
whereas
the
ordinary
in
rem
thing
was
not
punishment.
justice
scalia
so,
your
answer
to
my
hypothetical
would
be
yes,
that
if
congress
got
tender-hearted
and
said,
well,
let's
make
an
exception
to
our
traditional
in
rem
forfeiture
of
pirate
ships
and
we'll
say
if
the
owner
of
the
ship
was
innocent
of
the
piracy,
we
won't
forfeit
it.
that
would
convert
it
suddenly
to
a
punishment,
and
if
it
was
just
a
small-time
pirate,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
take
the
ship
even
from
the
pirate--
justice
scalia
--because
that
would
be
too
much
punishment.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
in
rem
whether
or
not
you
decide
to
let
the
innocent
person
off.
i
don't
see
how
that
makes
a
difference.
justice
scalia
i
assume
the
higher
the
fine...
the
poorer
you
are,
the
easier
it
is
to
impose
a
higher
fine.
to
the
extent
you're
insolvent,
you
don't
pay
it
anyway.
justice
scalia
well,
why...
what
is
the
reason
why
it's
disproportionate
here?
because
there
were
only
a
couple
of
grams
involved?
why...
i
mean,
it's
a
violation
of
the
drug
laws.
justice
scalia
well,
it
depends
entirely
upon
how
serious
the
society
considers
a
drug
offense
to
be
i
suppose.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
not
relatively
minor
if
society
really
has
its
face
set
against
drugs
and
has
provided
for...
at
the
federal
level
at
least,
for
penalties
of
the
sort
that
has
been
mentioned.
how
can
we
say
it's
relatively
minor?
i
can
only
look
to
the
federal
statute
and
say,
gee,
at
least
the
federal
government
thinks
this
is
very
serious
stuff.
it's
very
harmful
to
society.
justice
scalia
mr.
estrada,
historically...
do
you
know
the
answer
to
this?
historically
at
the
time
the
eighth
amendment
was
adopted,
was
there
such
a
thing
as
in
rem
forfeiture
of
real
property,
or
was
it
limited
to
ships
and
personal
property?
justice
scalia
in
that
case,
mr.
estrada,
was
it
a
leasehold
interest
or
a
fee
interest?
justice
scalia
didn't
they
set
aside...
i
haven't
looked
at
the
case
for
quite
a
while.
didn't
they
set
aside
part
of
the
forfeiture
in
that
case?
justice
scalia
and
your
understanding
is
that
even
though
it
was
a
leasehold,
actually
what
was
forfeited
was
the
fee
interest
in
the
property.
justice
scalia
--mr.
estrada,
historically
did
these
in
rem
forfeitures
contain
an
exclusion
for
the
property
of
innocent
persons?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
stop...
it
doesn't
turn
it
from
remedial
into
punitive.
