justice
stevens
are
you
saying...
i
want
to...
i
am
not...
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
following
your
argument.
are
you
saying
the
tests
should
be
different
depending
on
whether
the...
assume
it's
an
instrumentality
of
the...
of
crime.
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
an
instrumentality
can
be
used
for
no
lawful
purpose,
burglar
tools
or
something
else,
that
that
would
have
a
different
test
than
one
where
you
have
an
automobile
and
most
of
the
time
it's
used
for
perfectly
legitimate
driving,
but
on
one
or
two
occasions
it's
involved
in
the
drug
trade.
are
you
saying
there's
a
different
test
depending
on
the
character
of
the
use
of
that
which
is
sought
to
be
forfeited?
justice
stevens
and
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
instrumentalities
of
crime
and
proceeds
of
illegal
activity?
justice
stevens
and
which
do
we
have
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
then
how
did
they
get...
how
could
they
forfeit
it
if
it
isn't
one
or
the
other?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it's
real
property,
homes,
et
cetera
that
are
used
in
the
furtherance
of
the
drug
trade,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
you're,
in
effect,
arguing
we
should
limit
the
historic
law
like
illegal
distilleries
and
things
like
that
to
properties
that
had
no
legitimate...
basically
had
no
significant
legitimate
use.
is
that
it?
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
they
had
no
legitimate
use,
that
it
would
always
be
proportional
to
forfeit
it.
i
don't
know
when
you
could
say
it's
disproportionate
to
take...
a
$1
million
distillery
would
be
no
different
from
a
$10
distillery
as
far
as
i
could
see.
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
it's
their
business
and
the
only
use
is
illegal,
it's
not
the
kind
of
business
we
want
to
preserve.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
estrada?
your
discussion
of
two
kinds
of
innocence
and
the
different...
your
colloquy
with
justice
kennedy
brings
this
to
mind.
in
the
dobbins
distillery
case
that
you
describe,
the
landlord
knew
that
the
property
is
going
to
be
used
for
a
distillery
and
perhaps
had
a
higher
duty
to
be
sure
they
kept
the
records
properly
and
so
forth.
but
you
say
you
would
apply
the
same
standard
in
a
case
like
that
as
if
just
an
ordinary
landlord
rented
a
flat
somewhere
to
a
party
and
had
no
reason
to
believe
it
was
to
be
used
for
anything
but
a
residence,
and
it
turned
out
that
the
tenant
dealt
in
drugs
in
the
flat
without
any
knowledge
of
the
landlord.
would
you
say
that
the
fee
interest
of
the
landlord
would
be
forfeitable
equally
as...
on
those
facts
as
in
the
distillery
case?
justice
stevens
no.
i'm
just
talking
about
would
the
constitutional
objection...
if
there
was
any
constitutional
problem
at
all,
would
you
say
the
analysis
would
be
the
same--
justice
stevens
--in
a
case
where
you
know
that
it's
the
kind
of
business
that
has
special
duties
and
special
concerns
on
the
one
hand,
and
just
rent
it
as
a
residence
on
the
other?
