mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
eighth
amendment
requires
that
civil
in
rem
forfeitures
be
proportional
to
the
criminal
culpability
of
the
owner
of
the
property.
seven
of
the
eight
courts
of
appeals
that
have
ruled
on
that
question,
including
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
have
concluded
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
require
that
type
of
proportionality
review,
and
because
the
majority
view
is
correct,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the...
there
is
no
contemporary
case
that
we've
been
able
to
find
in
which
a
specific
issue
was
made
of
the
fact.
there
is
a
case,
dobbins
distillery,
which
is
cited
in
our
case,
in
which
the
claim
was
raised
specifically
that
real
property
in
that
case
could
not
be
forfeited,
and
the
court
dealt
with
the
real
property
in
the
case
much
as
it
had
dealt
with
the
claims
of
ships
and
the
like
without
giving
any
indication
whatsoever
that
the
real
estate,
by
virtue
of
being
that
type
of
property
interest,
couldn't
be
forfeited
under
the
common
law.
the
statute
in
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
the
fee
interest
was
forfeited.
the
facts
of
the
case
were
that
the
claimant
had
leased
the
interest
to
someone
who
then
used
it
for
the
purpose
of
a
distillery
business,
and
the
person
who
was
so
using
it
was
putting
it
to
a
lawful
use
so
long
as
he
kept
records
and
paid
taxes,
which
he
failed
to
do.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
acts
of
the
lessee
in
not
doing
what
he
was
supposed
to
do,
the
property,
including
the
tract
of
land,
was
forfeited
to
the
government.
and
the
statute
in
that
case
was
very
clear
that
the
tract
of
land
was
to
be
forfeited.
it
was
a
statute
passed
by
congress
i
believe
on
july
20,
1868
and
is
found
at
15
stat.,
page
133.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
court's...
in
how
the
court
dealt
with
the
case
that
it
thought
of
this
as
being
in
any
way
unusual.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
my
recollection.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
what...
how
we
read
the
case,
and
the
statute
i
think
was
very
clear.
it
actually
made
reference
to
the
tract
of
land
rather
than
to
the
interest
of
the
owner.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
dobbins--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--distillery,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
this
court
has
long
understood
the
eighth
amendment
with
its
references
to
bail,
fines,
and
punishments,
to
be
directed
to
the
criminal
law
function
of
the
government.
and
consistent
with
that
understanding,
this
court
in
brown
and
ferris
concluded
that
the
word
fine,
as
used
in
that
amendment
and
as
understood
by
the
framers,
meant
a
payment
to
a
sovereign
as
punishment
for
some
offense.
our
claim
here
is
that
civil
in
rem
forfeitures
are
not
fines
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
do
not
otherwise
implicate
the
eighth
amendment
because
they
have
never
been
considered
punishment
for
an
offense.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
halper
indicates
that
there
are
certain
cases
in
which
the
court
will
disregard
the
label
that
congress
has
chosen
to
put
on
a
given
exaction,
but
under
certain
very
limited
circumstances.
both
halper
and
the
case
of
bell
v.
wolfish,
which
is
cited,
do
what
is
in
essence
an
as-applied
challenge
to
a
specific
government
conduct;
that
is
a
claim
that
even
though
a
statute
is
civil
in
the
usual
case,
as
applied
in
the
case,
it
should
be
considered
forbidden
punishment.
but
in
the
type
of
as-applied
challenge,
both
halper
and
bell
concentrated
on
the
seventh
mendoza-martinez
factor,
which
is
whether
the
government
conduct
seems
excessive
in
relation
to
the
nonpunitive
purpose
as
being
claimed
for
it.
the
theory
of
both
cases,
which
was
a
theory
that
won
in
halper
and
lost
in
bell
v.
wolfish,
was
that
if
the
government
exaction
in
the
specific
case
is
so
patently
out
of
kilter
with
the
stated
nonpunitive
purpose,
then
the
court
may
safely
infer
that
the
true
purpose
was
something
else,
i.e.,
the
desire
to
use
the
sanction
in
the
specific
case,
not
to
further
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
to
inflict
what
is,
in
essence,
punishment.
halper
makes
very
clear
that
the
road
to
that
level
of...
lack
of
rationality
is
very
long
and
there
are
very
few
cases
in
which
the
specific
invocation
of--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
every
case
in
which
the
government
conduct
is
challenged
can
be
subjected
to
a
halper
inquiry.
we
think
that
this
class
of
cases,
including
this
specific
case,
is
of
such
a
nature
that
the
inquiry
should
never
be
successful
because
since
the
whole
point
of
the
in
rem
forfeiture
statute
is
to
make
the
property
unavailable
for
further
unlawful
use
and
to
compensate
the
victims
of
the
unlawful
use,
it
will
never
be
a
case
in
which
the
specific
invocation
of
the
forfeiture
statute
will
exceed
the
bounds
that
the
court
outlined
in
halper.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
you
can
certainly
accept
that
the
civil
forfeiture
statute
in
this
case
is
part
of
a
whole
set
of
weapons,
if
you
will,
that
congress
chose
to
use
for
a
very
grave
social
issue,
and
we
certainly
concede
that
it
is
part
of
the
statute
that
certain
owners
will
be
deterred
from
using
the
property
in
this
way.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
claim
that
anytime
there
is
any
element
of
deterrence
in
government
action,
that
that
automatically
means
that
the
action
should
be
set
aside
or
that
it
should
be
examined
under
heightened
constitutional
scrutiny,
and
we
don't
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
don't
think
that
what
we
have
in
this
case,
either
as
a
general
matter
or
in
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
that
we
can
call
this
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
i
think
we
would.
i
just...
as
a
comment
on
that
cite,
it
is
often
the
case
that
a
word
can
be
used
by
members
of
congress,
such
as
the
word
punish,
in
a
sense
which
is
broader
than
the
constitutional
sense.
and
we
think
that
even
though
there
are,
in
fact,
some
such
statements
in
the
legislative
record,
that
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
history
of
this
type
of
thing
show
that
this
is
not
punitive
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
as
to
that
point,
i
think
we
would
simply
point
to
the
tests
that
this
court
has
followed
in
a
case
like
mendoza-martinez.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
excuse
me,
justice
stevens...
i
mean,
justice
white.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
if
you
thought
that
this
was,
in
fact,
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense,
there
would
still
be
the
claim
as
to
whether
it
is
excessive
punishment.
the
eighth
amendment
doesn't
outlaw
punishment.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
i
think
it
is
true
that
congress
cannot
get
out
of
the
eighth
amendment
simply
by
the
label
that
it
places
on
something.
it
is
also--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
conclude
under
the
tests
that
this
court
has
always
applied
in
similar
inquiries
like
the
mendoza
case
that
in
fact
what
this
statute
does
is
to
inflict
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
if
that
were
the
case,
then
it
would
follow
that
you
could,
in
fact,
look
at
what
the
government
is
doing
under
the
eighth
amendment.
our
principal
claim
in
this
case
is
that
something
of
this
type,
by
reason
of
history
and
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
history
still
serves
a
purpose
to
this
day,
should
not
be
considered
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
no,
and
i
think
when
the
court
went
over
the
history
of
the
excessive
fines
language
in
the
eighth
amendment
in
the
brown
and
ferris
case,
the
court
concluded
that
to
the
framers
the
excessive
fines...
that
the
fines
that
are
mentioned
in
the
eighth
amendment
were
payments
to
the
sovereign
as
punishment
for
some
offense
because
then
and
now
fines
are
assessed
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
justice
white.
i
should
say
that
in
looking
at
the
issue
of
whether
this
is,
in
fact,
punishment
in
the
constitutional
sense,
there
are
tests
that
this
court
has
always
applied,
most
notably
the
mendoza-martinez
factors.
and
using
that
very
test,
this
court
only
a
few
years
ago
ruled
that
a
very
similarly
worded
in
rem
forfeiture
statute
was
not
punishment
under
the
mendoza-martinez
factors.
that
case
is
one
assortment
of
89
firearms,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
in
that
case,
the
statute
in
question
mandated
forfeiture
of
all
firearms
used
or
intended
to
be
used
in
violations
of
the
gun
control
act
or
any
other
criminal
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
don't
think
that
the
constitutional
standard
in
that
event
would
be
significantly
different
because
in
either
case,
you
would
be
looking
at
whether
the
government
exaction
is
extremely
out
of
kilter
with
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
with
the
exaction.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
think
that
the
standard
would
be
comparable
to
the
standard
that
the
court
used
in
harmelin,
which
is
in
the
first
instance
to
ask
whether
the
fine
or
the
punishment
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
we
do,
justice
white.
our
principal
claim
here
is
that
this
type
of
conduct
is
not
punishment,
but
even
if
it
is,
our
alternative
claim
is
that
under
the
harmelin
standard,
this
conduct
couldn't
be
found
to
meet
the
level
of
excessiveness
that
would
counsel
setting
it
aside.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
justice
scalia,
in
a
very
limited
sense.
not
innocence
of
the
crime
as
such.
there
is
an
1808
case
written
by
chief
justice
marshall
that
was
cited
in
this
court's
opinion
in
calero-toledo,
and
the
name
of
the
case
is
peish
v.
ware,
which
is
cited
at
page
689
of
calero-toledo
and
is
reported
at
fork
ranch
347.
that
was
a
case
in
which
a
ship
had
been
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
delaware.
the
goods
were
taken
to
the
coast,
and
the
government
brought
a
forfeiture
action
claiming
that
shortly
after
the
ship
was
shipwrecked,
the
goods
had
been
found
in
delaware
without
tax
stamps.
the
government
lost
that
case,
chief
justice
marshall
saying
what
seemed
to
be
a
statement
of
the
common
law
of
forfeiture,
that
a
forfeiture
wouldn't
lie
at
common
law
in
a
case
where
there
was
nothing
that
the
person,
on
whom
the
forfeiture
would
work,
could
have
done
to
keep
it
from
happening.
and
we
would
take
that
as
being
part
of
the
common
law
of
forfeiture.
this
court's
case
in
calero-toledo
cited
that
and
in
addition
said
that
invoking
a
forfeiture
under
those
facts
would
likely
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
in
addition,
footnote
27
in
calero-toledo
pointed
out...
excuse
me...
that
since
1790
the
federal
government
has
had
statutes
that
provide
for
the
remission
of
forfeitures
as
a
matter
of
administrative
grace
when
the
owner
can
show
that
he
was
without
intent
or
without
willful
negligence,
and
that
goes
back
to
1790.
we
think
that
congress'
decision
to
include
something
very
much
like
that
in
this
statute,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right
rather
than
as
a
matter
of
grace,
really
doesn't
change
what
the
nature
of
the
action--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--correct,
because
that
has
always
been
there.
throughout
the
history
since
1790,
there
have
been
some
statutes
that
actually
vest
that
type
of
claim
with
the
court
and
there
are
some
statutes
now
where
a
claimant
can
go
to
a
court
and
ask
that
the
forfeiture
be
mitigated
rather
than
going
to
an
agency,
but
that
has
always
been
there
since
1790.
and
making
this
a
matter
of
statutory
right
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
the
action.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
we
have
to...
yes,
but
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
two
meanings
of
innocence
in
this
context.
when
the
court
has
always
said
that
innocence
is
not
relevant,
what
it
had
meant
as
the
cases
make
clear
is
that
you
needn't
be
guilty
of
a
crime.
however,
it
is
still
possible
and,
indeed,
likely
that
you
haven't
been
very
careful
with
your
property.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
think
that
that's
not
necessarily
the
case
because
i
think
what
chief
justice
marshall
had
in
mind
and
what
we
have
had
through
the
history
is
the
imposition
of
a
very
high
standard
of
care--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--on
the
owner.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
right,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--correct,
and
i
think
that
that
is,
in
fact,
what
we
think
has
historically
justified
civil
forfeitures.
the
civil
forfeiture
statutes
go
on
the
really
common
sense
premise
that
there
are
certain
uses
of
property
that
are
so
harmful
and
so
socially
undesirable
that
the
law
must
place
every
incentive
on
the
owner
of
the
property
to
make
sure,
even
if
that
takes
taking
affirmative
steps,
that
no
one,
whether
the
owner
knows
about
him
or
not,
will
inflict
those
harms
on
society
with
the
owner's
property.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
and
we
would
say
that
as
a
historical
matter,
that
person
wouldn't
have
that
type
of
a
claim
because
the
whole
point
of
having
a
remedy
of
this
type
is
to
take
note
of
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
things
that
only
an
owner
can
do
and
only
an
owner
can
take
care
of
his
property
and
make
sure
that
it
is
not
broken
into
and
turned
into
a
crack
house,
for
example.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there
were
two
types
of
forfeiture
at
early
common
law,
justice
kennedy.
one
of
them
was
the
so-called
forfeiture
of
estate,
which
really
was
in
personam
and
really
only
came
into
play
when
the
government
proved
with
a
judgment
of
conviction
that
the
person
had,
in
fact,
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
the
other
type
of
forfeiture
really
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
crimes
that
were
hurting
the
king's
bench.
it
was
in
a
completely
different
court
system,
the
court
of
the
exchequer,
and
that
type
of
forfeiture,
which
is,
in
essence,
what
is
at
issue
here,
didn't
partake
of
the
rationale
that
you
just
gave
i
think.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
right,
but
it
is
not
the
same
type
of
forfeiture
that
is
at
issue
here,
justice
kennedy.
if
this
were
a
case
in
which
the
forfeiture
could
only
be
had
upon
the
conviction
of
a
crime,
we
don't...
we
would
not
be
here
because
we
would
concede
that
the
essence
of
that
sort
of
action
is
on
the
person.
what
we
do
have
here
is
a
statute
that
really
doesn't
need
the
criminal
law
other
than
to
state
a...
other
than
to
set
a
standard
of
conduct
and,
taking
that
as
the
standard
of
conduct,
then
says
if
your
property
has
been
used
or
is
intended
to
be
used
for
this
purpose,
then
we
will
make
sure
that
that
harm
doesn't
come
to
pass
by
placing
the
property
in
the
hands
of
someone
who
can
give
surety
to
society
as
a
whole
that
these
harms
won't
happen.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
different
type
of
forfeiture
than
the
forfeiture
that
you
have
in
mind,

well,
it
would
not
happen
under
this
statute
because
of
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
although--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
the
mode
of
looking
at
the
question
would
be
the
same
in
the
sense
that
you
would
ask
the
same
questions,
i.e.,
whether
the
owner
did
everything
that
he
physically
could
to
ensure
that
this
didn't
happen.
i
think
if
the
owner,
for
example,
never
was
around
to
see
all
of
the
suspicious
people
come
and
go
and
really
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
stop
by
and
look
at
the
property,
it
is
possible
that
that
person
would
lose.
someone
who
did
take
those
steps,
we
would
think
that
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
he
would
have
exercised
every
care
that
the
law
could
ask
of
him.
and
if
after
every
care
and
physically...
and
after
physically
doing
everything
that
he
could,
the
harm
still
came
to
pass,
we
would
understand
the
common
law
as
giving
that
person
a
defense.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
we'll
rely
on
our
briefs.
