justice
kennedy
well,
we
can
accept
in
this
case,
can
we
not,
mr.
estrada,
that
the
purpose
of
the
forfeiture
statute
is
supplementary
to
the
criminal
laws
because
it
deters
and
punishes?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
addition
to
deterrence,
it's
punishment,
is
it
not,
in
the
civil
forfeiture
context
that
we
have
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
the
brief
that
the
justice
department
filed
in
the
parcel
of
land
case
that
we
decided
earlier
this
term,
the
solicitor
general
is
quoted
at
length
from
the
senate
committee
report
indicating
that
the
purpose
of
these
laws
would
be
to
deter
and
punish
further
because
criminal
sanctions
were
ineffective
to
combat
the
drug
trade.
so,
i
just
think
that
we
ought
to
recognize
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
deter
and
punish.
if
we
do
recognize
that,
do
you
have
a
more
difficult
case?
justice
kennedy
and
didn't
the
framers
recognize
that?
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
the
framers
were
concerned
that
the
criminal
laws
not
be
used
to
impose
excessive
punishments,
and
certainly
in
the
early
history
of
england,
that
was
true
with
reference
to
forfeitures
for
felonies.
