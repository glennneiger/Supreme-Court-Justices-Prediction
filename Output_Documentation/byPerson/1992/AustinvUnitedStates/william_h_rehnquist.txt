chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-6073,
richard
lyle
austin
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
we
rejected
the
application
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so,
the
constitution
automatically
erects
a
shield
against
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
do
with
a
case
like
calero-toledo
which
says
that
even
an
innocent
owner...
and
no
one
contends,
i
take
it,
that
your
client
is
innocent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
an
innocent
owner
can...
the
property
can
be
taken
under
traditional
forfeiture
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
matter
with
it?
it
always
struck
me
as
a
perfectly
good
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
somebody
like
mr.
harmelin,
as
we
call
them
all
mister,
in
the
drug
case
from
michigan
where
he
was
convicted
of
a
relatively
minor
offense,
possession
i
guess
perhaps
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
he
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment?
surely,
that's
a
much
more
severe
punishment
than
the
loss
of
one's
mobile
home,
and
yet
we
held
that
was
not
barred
by
the
eighth
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
felt
the
constitution
didn't
prohibit
the
states
from
doing
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
yours
was
only
2
grams?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
from
the
statistics
you
gave,
it
isn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
he's
at
least
able
to
start
over
again
in
a
way
that
harmelin
never
was,
spending
the
rest
of
his
life
in
jail.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
name
of
the
case,
mr.
estrada?
chief
justice
rehnquist
dobbins?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
johnson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
the
more
lenient
congress
is
with
respect
to
the
mental
element,
scienter,
the
more
it
is
criminal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
if
the
statute
provides
that
lack
of
scienter
is
a
defense,
then
that
tends
to
make
it
a
criminal
statute.
did
i
misunderstand?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
the
more
lenient
congress
is
with
respect
to
the
party
involved,
the
more
it's
criminal
rather
than
civil.
that
strikes
me
as
astounding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
the
case
is
submitted.
