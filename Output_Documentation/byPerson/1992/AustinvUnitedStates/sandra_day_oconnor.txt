justice
o'connor
i
thought
this
particular
statute
does
provide
a
defense
for
innocent
owners,
does
it
not?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
we're
dealing
here
with
what
could
be
characterized
as
a
punitive
sanction.
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
punishment
if
the
owner
has
not
engaged
in
punishable
misconduct?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
how--
justice
o'connor
--if
the
owner
has
not
engaged
in
punishable
conduct.
justice
o'connor
then
how
would
that
be
punishment?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so.
it
might
be
a
confiscation,
but
i...
it's
a
little
hard
to
call
it
punishment
i
would
think.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
government
can
always
decide
that
certain
property
is
malum
in
se.
in
other
words,
it's
contraband.
it
can
be
taken.
justice
o'connor
it
has
no
proper
use
or
it's
dangerous
to
the
public.
justice
o'connor
i
would
think
there
would
be
many
reasons
where
you
could
take
property
even
from
someone
who's
totally
innocent.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
doesn't
halper
indicate
that
a
civil
pecuniary
sanction,
designed
to
be
remedial,
can
be
punitive?
justice
o'connor
where
it
would
meet
the
standard.
well,
should
this
case
be
subjected
to
a
halper
inquiry
do
you
think?
