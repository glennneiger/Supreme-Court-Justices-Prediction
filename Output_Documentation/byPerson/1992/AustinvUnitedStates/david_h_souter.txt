justice
souter
in
your
case,
do
you
agree
with
the
correctness
of
the
government's
statement
that
if
your
client
had
been
prosecuted
federally,
the
fines
could
have
amounted
to
$1
million?
justice
souter
well,
if
it
had
happened,
is
the...
would
the
application
of
the
statute
be
unconstitutional?
justice
souter
what
did
the
prior
or
the
old
law
mean
when
it
defined
the
objective
of
the
in
rem
action
as
remedial?
remedial
in
the
sense
of
removing
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
from
the
hands
of
criminals?
justice
souter
well,
that's
exactly
what's
being
done
here,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
well,
ships
were
not
necessarily
designed
for
smuggling
either,
but
they
were
used
for
that.
and
warehouses
on
long
wharf
in
boston
weren't
necessarily
built
for
smuggling,
but
that's
what
they
were
used
for,
and
they
were
forfeitable
i
suppose.
justice
souter
well,
the
mobile
home
was
being
used
to
store
drugs,
wasn't
it?
justice
souter
i
forget
where
the
cocaine
was
found,
but
i
mean,
there's
a
bag
of
cocaine
either
in
the
body
shop
or
the
mobile
home.
i
mean,
i
just
am
finding
the
distinction
based
on
remedial
versus
punitive
a
pretty
ethereal
distinction,
and
what
bothers
me
about
it
is
if
we
go
your
way
on
the
theory
that
there
is,
in
effect,
a
punitive
function
going
on
here
by
virtue
of
the
innocent
owner
defense,
then
we
have
to
face
the
fact
that
despite
that
variation,
we're
still
dealing
with
two
kinds
of
in
rem
actions,
one
against
the
guilty
owner
and
one
all
other
varieties
of
in
rem
action.
and
we
would
have
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
saying
that
the
guilty
owner
has
a
proportionality
objection.
the
innocent
owner
has
none
whatsoever
in
those
cases
which
make
no
distinction
between
innocent
and
guilty
owners.
and
i
suppose
the
next
step
down
the
road,
if
we
go
your
way,
is
going
to
be
the
due
process
argument,
that
one
cannot
go
against
an
innocent
owner
in
an
in
rem
action
simply
because
the
government
has
no
justifiable
purpose
under
the
due
process
clause
when
at
the
same
time
the
guilty
owner
is
allowed
to
contest
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
setting
us
off
on
rather
a
steep
slope
if
we
buy
your
argument,
and
i'm
trying
to
see
if
there's
a
way
out
of
it.
justice
souter
well,
then
do
we
take
the
next
step
and
say
in
the
most
garden
variety
of
old-fashioned
in
rem
actions,
there
is
likewise
going
to
be
a
proportionality
defense,
and
in
fact,
it
will
always
work
i
suppose
because
the
owner
is
always
going
to
be
innocent
or
innocence
is
always
going
to
be...
strike
that.
guilt
is
always
going
to
be
irrelevant.
justice
souter
well,
it's
irrelevant
under
the
traditional
in
rem
action
as
you
were
describing
it.
you're
saying
it's
remedial.
it's
not
punitive.
why
isn't
the
proportionality
argument,
at
least
as
raised
by
a
person
who
claims
innocence
and
can
show
innocence,
always
going
to
succeed?
justice
souter
well,
if
i'm
innocent,
it's
disproportionate
to
take
a
nickel
out
of
my
pocket,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
then
it's
always
going
to
succeed.
justice
souter
but
none
of
those
categories
would
be
applicable
to
the
property
involved
here.
justice
souter
just
looking
at
it
from
the
other
side,
that
sort
of
provides
an
answer
to
the
question
that
i
asked
your
brother,
and
that
is,
assuming
we
do
find
that
there's
something
punitive
here
and
we
don't
classify
it
as
immune
from
review
merely
as
a
remedial
forfeiture,
there
seems
then
to
be
a
historical
basis
for
us
not
to
have
to
worry
about
the
case
of
the
truly
innocent
owner
subject
to
the
classic
historical
forfeiture
because
that
person,
based
on
your
case
from
fork
ranch,
may
very
well
have
had
a
defense
to
the
forfeiture
all
along.
justice
souter
in
the
case
of
the
parents
whose
child
uses
the
house
to
store
drugs
that
he
sells
on
the
street,
you
would
say
if
they
had
reason
to
know
that
he
was
using
them,
their
property
would
historically
be...
on
historical
grounds
be
subject
to
forfeiture
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
defense;
whereas,
if
they
had
not
in
any
way
been
negligent
in
failing
to
know
of
the
fact
that
he
was
using
his
room
as
a
storehouse
for
the
drugs
he
was
selling,
they
would
have
a
defense.
justice
souter
a...
an
affirmative
obligation--
justice
souter
--really
to
take--
justice
souter
--to
take
care
that
it
not
be
used.
justice
souter
and
that,
of
course,
would
be
your
answer
to
the
claim
of
the
so-called
innocent
owner
who
was
merely
negligent.
justice
souter
yes.
