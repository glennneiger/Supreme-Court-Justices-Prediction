mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
brecht
was
convicted
after
a
jury
trial
after
the
special
prosecutor
in
this
case
first
on
cross-examination
of
mr.
brecht
then
on
re-cross
initial
closing
argument
and
final
closing
argument,
breached
a
promise
that
had
been
made
to
mr.
brecht
that
if
he
remained
silent
at
a
certain
point
in
time
that
silence
would
not
be
used
against
him.
the
case
involves
a
core
due
process
violation.
it
does
not
involve
the
miranda
case
itself,
nor
is
it
a
case
that
involves
a
prophylactic
rule
or
a
prophylactic
right.
let
me
explain.
if
this
court...
pardon?
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
not
primarily.
this
is
a
due
process
case.
the
promise
that
was
made--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--the
promise
that
was
made
to
him
could
have
been
any
promise.
the
promise
was
made,
and
that's
important,
but
the
promise
is
analogous
to
the
promise
that
was
made
in
johnson
v.
united
states,
united
states
v.
hale,
raley
v.
ohio,
santobello
v.
new
york,
which
is
the
plea
bargain
line
of
cases,
as
well
as
what
was
stated
in
the
cupps
v.
louisiana
case,
where
the
officers
told
certain
civil
rights
demonstrators
that
they
had
the
right
to
go
and
demonstrate
at
a
certain
place,
and
then
those
same
demonstrators
were
prosecuted
for
demonstrating
near
the
courthouse.
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
state
told
somebody
they
had
a
right
to
do
something,
then
attempted
in
one
way
or
another
to
penalize
them,
and
this
court
in
all
of
those
cases
said
that
the
use
of
that
penalty
against
that
person
violated
due
process.
it's
also
not...
this
case
is
also
not
a
prophylactic
case.
it
does
not
involve
a
prophylactic
rule,
because
all
that
mr.
brecht
is
seeking
is
the
specific
performance
of
the
promise
that
was
given
to
him
that
if
he
remained
silent,
that
silence
would
not
be
used
against
him.
on
a
scale
of
1
to
10,
where
10
is
prophylactic,
this
case
is
a
zero.
he's
seeking
exactly
the
due
process
performance,
the
specific
performance
of
the
promise
that
was
made
that
at
the
trial
which
was
going
to
be
subsequent,
or
was
subsequent
to
the
promise
that
was
made,
that
the
state
not
be
permitted
to
use
its
breach
of
that
promise
to
attempt
to
secure
his
conviction.
he
seeks
that
to
be
excluded.
the
constitutional
violation
in
mr.
brecht's
case
would
occur
at
trial.
it's
not
like
the
questions
of
illegal
searches
and
seizures
where
this
court
may
have
to
deal
with
cases
after
the
constitutional
violation
has
occurred,
and
the
question
of
remedying
that
violation
that's
already
occurred
is
part
of
what
this
court
has
to
consider.
in
addition,
the
case
involves,
and
doyle
involves,
a
question
of
the
legitimacy
of
inferences.
this
case
does
go
to
what
kind
of
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
silence.
at
a
certain
point,
we
would
contend,
an
inference
can
become
so
tenuous
that
it
violates
due
process
to
draw
the
inference.
i
would
suggest
that
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
estelle
v.
mcguire
suggests
the
possibility
of
such
matters,
but
in
this
case
there's
a
problem
of
unreliability,
that
the
inferences
that
may
be
drawn
from
his
silence
and
the
use
of
that
silence
after
the
miranda
warning
is
certainly
unreliable.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
no.
that
explicit
statement--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--yes,
and
as
this
court
has
interpreted
in
doyle
and
subsequent
cases.
actually,
it's
not
exactly
clear
what
statement
was
made
to
him.
the
record
only
reflects
that
at
the
first
appearance
in
court
he
was
given
his
miranda
rights,
but
the
record
that
i
have
seen
does
not
actually
contain
a
text
of
the
rights
that
were
given
to
him,
so
we're
assuming
that
the
miranda
rights
were
the
typical
set
of
miranda
rights.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
every
court
except
the
first
court,
the
trial
court...
the
most
important
one.
it
didn't
find
a
doyle
violation,
and
it
let
the
prosecutor
go
ahead
and
use
the
arguments
and
the
questions
that
he
was
using
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
objected
to
repeatedly
by
counsel.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
appellate
court...
the
state
appellate
court
found
it
was
not
harmless
error,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
found
it
was
harmless
error,
and
that's
the
only
court
that
has
found
it
to
have
been
harmless
error.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
what
they
purported
to
apply,
yes.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
yes,
your
honor,
you're
the
sixth.
the
fact
that
each
court
has
reversed
the
decision,
in
effect,
of
the
court
before
suggests
the
closeness
of
the
issue
in
terms
of
this
particular
case,
and
since
this
is
a
case
about
the
allocation
of
risks,
of
who
loses
in
close
cases,
we
think
it's
a
particularly
appropriate
case
that
the
current
chapman
standard
remain
the
standard
test.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
district
court...
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
chapman
standard
and
found
that
the
error
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
state
had
failed
to
meet
its
burden,
and
found
specifically
that
the
use
of
the
silence,
the
impermissible
use
of
the
silence,
may
have
been
critical
to
the
actual--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
court
of--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--the
court
of
appeals
applied
a
different
standard,
reversing
the
district
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
not
to
the
findings
that
the
error
was
harmless.
at
least,
there's
no
absolute
deference
that
is
supposed
to
be
paid.
this
court
in
brown
v.
allen
many
years
ago
suggested
that
these
kinds
of
issues
are
ones
in
which
you
should
certainly
pay
attention
to
the
state's--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--the
deference
that
is
due,
is
what
this
court
said
in
brown
v.
allen,
is
what
those
findings
are
entitled
to,
but
no
more
than
that.
this
court,
or
federal
courts
under
habeas
have
a
different
command,
a
command
that's
narrowed
to
the
guardianship
of
particular
federal
rights,
normally
federal
constitutional
rights,
and
in
its
special
charge
given
to
it
by
congress,
both
to
it
and
to
the
federal
district
courts,
it
has
an
obligation...
or
the
federal
courts
have
an
obligation
to
see
that
fundamental
rights
remain
to
be
protected.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
this
court
can
certainly
establish
due
process
rules
in
that
manner,
and
i
think
in
some
cases
it
may
have.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
but
in
the
doyle
case
line
this
court
has
not
started
off
that
way.
it
started
off
by
saying
that
this
is
a
violation
itself,
creating
a
bright
line
test
which
at
least
eliminates
the
difficult
questions
that
often
occur
of
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
violation
has
occurred.
the
fact
of
the
violation
is
not
really
contested
in
this
court.
hale
isn't
contested,
i
think,
in
even
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case.
the
question's
always
been
the
things
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
violation.
for
most
of
this
court's
history,
habeas
corpus
review,
once
habeas
corpus
review
reaches
the
merits,
has
applied
the
same
standard
of
review
for
habeas
corpus
as
this
court
has
applied
on
direct
appeal.
now,
there's
a
big
caveat.
today,
as
the
court
knows,
there
are
many
hurdles
to
getting
into
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
and
reaching
the
merits.
they
include
questions
of
exhaustion,
the
abuse
of
the
writs,
waiver,
and
various
other
procedural
hurdles.
this
case
doesn't
raise
any
of
those
questions.
mr.
brecht
has
properly
preserved
all
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
today
to
this
court.
there's
no
allegation
that
none
has
not
been.
there's
no
abuse.
this
is
his
first
attempt
to
seek
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
so
he's
one
of
those
few
cases
that
have
managed
to
make
it
through
the
entire
minefield
of
procedural
barriers
to
seek
to
reach
a
determination
about
the
merits
of
the
core
issue
that's
presented.
moreover,
it
involves
no
teague
issue.
he's
not
seeking
any
kind
of
different
right
that
would
otherwise
have
not
been
available
to
him
on
direct
appeal.
we
see
the
teague
rule
as
simply
stating
that
you
get
no
more
when
you
go
up
on
habeas
corpus
than
you
would
have
gotten
had
you
gone
up
directly
on
certiorari
on
direct
appeal
and
submitted
to
the
court
under
the
rules
of
law
applicable
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
it
does--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--well,
the
cases
that
i've
seen...
i'm
assuming
i'm
thinking
about
the
same
sort
of
case
line...
would
suggest
that
in
federal...
federal
habeas
corpus
in
2255
relief,
it's
quite
analogous
to,
or
the
court
treats
it
as
analogous
to,
in
some
instances
such
as
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
convictions,
that
are
effectively
the
same
as
in
state
court.
the
more
recent
decision...
the
case
name
slips
my
mind
right
now...
is
really
an
application
of
teague
without
announcing
at
the
time,
because
it
predates
teague
but
teague
principles
are
involved,
suggesting
that
the
same
rule,
the
same
substantive
rule,
ought
to
apply
on
2255
at
the
time
of
the
case,
had
it
gone
up
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
think
different
considerations
may
sometimes
apply,
particularly
when
you're
coming
from
federal
jurisdictions
and
federal
convictions.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
this
court's
supervisory
power
may
also
be
implicated.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
part
of
the--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--i
don't
think
it
speaks
to
the
standard
of
review,
or
the
appropriateness
of
the
standard
of
review.
i
think
it
speaks
to
the
question
of
this
court's
power.
the
interplay
between
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
the
rules
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
relief
that
this
court
has
announced,
or...
and
congress
has
enacted,
that
imports
a
whole
set
of
different
considerations
that
are
not
applicable
in
2254
cases,
and
so
it
may
be
that
certain--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--i
don't
think
that's
part
of
the
proposition.
the
constitutional
plan
indicates
that
federal
courts,
at
least
this
court
in
particularly,
ultimately
is
to
decide
federal
constitutional
questions.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
don't
think
that's
at
issue.
congress
has
said
that
federal--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--no,
i'm
not
willing
to
accept
that,
and
i
think
this
court
has
several
times
suggested
that
that
argument
is
inappropriate,
that
there
is
an
obligation
that
federal
courts
have
to
ensure
that
state
courts
tow
the
constitutional
line,
or
tow
the
constitutional
mark
when
reviewing
the
federal
constitutional
questions
which
they
sometimes
must
review,
and
that
in
the
ideal
world
there
would
be
no
lesser
standard
and
no
lesser
guarantee
of
federal
constitutional
rights
in
state
courts.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
no,
they're
not,
and
they're
not
because
they
have
so
many
other
considerations
to
worry
about
in
cases
that
come
up
on
direct
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
federal
constitutional
rights
are
certainly
something
they're
concerned
with.
it's
only
one
of
many
things
they
are
concerned
with.
the
federal
habeas
corpus
remedy,
particularly
2254,
focuses
in
and
narrows
in
on
one
set
of
peculiar
rights,
federal
constitutional
rights...
nothing
else.
state
error,
state
procedural
error,
state
law
interpretations,
all
those
kinds
of
issues,
are
stripped
out
of
the
case.
they're
not
available
to
this
court
or
to
federal
district
courts
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
so
what
the
federal
court
has
is
a
very
different
kind
of
question.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
no.
the
difference
is
one
of
the
charge
that
congress
made
to
federal
district
courts,
to
courts
of
appeals,
and
this
court,
that
they
are
supposed
to
enforce
federal
constitutional
rights
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus
provisions
in
2254.
to
go
back
for
a
second
to
2255,
in
2255
cases,
there
has
already
been
a
federal
court,
or
possibly
several
federal
courts,
that
in
theory
have
already
addressed
the
issue,
so
the
interests
of
ensuring
that
courts
tow
the
constitutional
mark
applies
in
a
different
relationship
to
2255
cases
than
it
does
in
terms
of
2254.
there's
already
a
federal
tribunal
that
has
addressed
the
case
at
some
point.
that's
not
true
on
2254,
and
it
may
be
an
additional
reason
for
different
treatment
in
these
cases.
i
would
not
suggest
that
it's
still
appropriate
that
the
chapman
standard
should
be
changed
for
2255,
although
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
harmless
error
standard,
we
would
suggest,
is
the
appropriate
standard.
it's
the
appropriate
standard
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
one
reason,
it's
stare
decisis
certainly
on
direct
appeal
since
chapman.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
contest
that.
it's
also
stare
decisis
on
collateral
attack
certainly
since
rose
v.
clark
in
1986,
and
i
would
suggest
as
well,
since
six
justices
expressed
that
opinion
in
dutton
v.
evans
in
1970,
and
all
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
justice
after
justice
after
justice
in
opinion
after
opinion
has
suggested
that
the
harmless
error
standard
is
appropriate
in
2254
cases.
it's
a
standard
that
works.
it's
worked
for
many
years.
it
involves
the
application
of
de
novo
review,
certainly
of
questions
of
law
and
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact,
once
the
case
reaches
appropriately
a
federal
district
court.
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
serves
interest
in
efficiency
as
well
as
interests
in
comity.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i'm
not
aware
of
this
court
ever
deciding
that
particular
proposition.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's...
harrington
is
direct
appeal.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
and
we'd
certainly--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--we
believe
it's
a
question
of
law--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--as
a
practical
matter,
and
we
would
suggest
that
what's
at
issue
here
is
certainly
an
issue
for
de
novo
review
by
the
federal
courts.
as
a
practical
matter,
there
really
weren't
any
facts
at
dispute
in
this
case
except
for
one,
the
fact
that
disputes
with
the
intent
or
alleged
intent
or
purpose
of
mr.
brecht
in
killing.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
certainly...
if
there's
a
question
of
fact
about
that,
that
fact
question's
not
been--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
no.
well,
those
are
the
ones
that
have
been
found
by
one
of
the
courts
already
to
rule
in
the
matter
to
have
violated
the
post-miranda
period
doyle
rule.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
there's
ambiguity
about
at
least
one
of
those
particular
references,
but
the
fact
that
it's
ambiguous
is
something
that
goes
directly
to
the
jury's
fact-finding
power.
it's
the
jury
that's
supposed
to
resolve
ambiguity
in
terms
of
these
kinds
of
factual
issues,
not
the
court,
and--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--there
is
dispute--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--that's
right.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
correct.
they
were
not
told
at
all
about
the
doyle
issue.
there
was
no
instruction
given
to
them.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
question
is
not
the
statements.
the
statements
that
are
quoted
are
all
quoted
from
the
trial.
that's
long
after--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--the
miranda
warnings.
the
question
is,
what
the
referent
of
the
statement
is--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--and
sometimes
it's
a
little
bit
unclear.
on
certain
of
them
it's
clear
that
it
does
include
the
period
of
miranda--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--out
of
what
i
count
up
as
five
particular
statements
that
the
courts
that
have
reviewed
below
have
found
to
have
breached
the
doyle
rule,
only
one,
i
believe,
legitimately
fits
into
a
dispute
category
in
terms
of
its
referent,
and
that,
the
ambiguity
in
terms
of
that
referent
under
doyle
and
under
chapman
ought
to
count
in
favor
of
mr.
brecht
in
terms
of
trying
to
figure
out
whether
there
was
a
possible
impact
under
chapman
to
the
conviction.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
right.
that's
right,
and
that's
why
we're
here
today,
because
we
believe
it
did
make
a
difference,
that
there
are
enough
post-miranda
rights,
post-doyle
violations
in
this
case
that
it
might
have
made
a
difference
to
this
particular
jury.
what
we
don't
know
is
how
this
jury
weighed
any
of
those
particular
arguments,
but
we
do
know...
and
the
joint
appendix
includes
a
large
part
of
the
summation
by
the
prosecutor.
we
do
know
how
central
the
argument
about
silence,
about
the
thrust
of
truthfulness
of
mr.
brecht's
testimony,
was
to
the
argument
of
the
case
below
to
the
jury,
and
so
it's
not
something
we
can
say
well,
this
is
a
side
issue.
this
went
right
to
the
core
of
the
case,
right
to
the
core
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitution...
whether
or
not
there
was
a
finding,
an
appropriate
finding
of
his
purpose
or
intent
to
kill
which
was
required
under
the
law
of
wisconsin
before
a
conviction
could
come
down
validly.
we
would
suggest
that
maintaining
the
doyle
rule,
or
maintaining
chapman,
is
quite
appropriate
in
terms
of
comity,
because
it
does
allow
federal
courts
to
use
the
analysis
of
the
state
courts
when
they
analyze
on
direct
appeal
under
chapman.
that
analysis
can
fully
inform
the
reviewing
federal
court
of
how
the
state
courts
saw
the
particular
interrelations
of
fact
and
law
in
the
particular
case.
if
you
apply
any
other
standard
on
federal
habeas
corpus
review,
what
you're
doing
is
you're
deprecating
that
particular
analysis
and
telling
the
federal
court,
well,
you
have
to
do
something
else.
and
there's
argument
about
that
may
or
may
not
be
something
that
is
more
burdensome
or
less
burdensome
in
the
federal
court,
but
it
certainly
would
be
something
different,
and
the
particular
analysis
that
the
state
supreme
court
or
appellate
court
went
through
would
be
something
that
would
not
be
directly
relevant
to
that
issue.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
but
unless
this
court
said
that
complete
deference
of
the
type
that
stone
v.
powell
is
involved,
would
be
appropriate,
the
federal
courts
would
still
have
to
decide
something,
and
in
fact
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
the
standard
on
kotteakos
developed
for
direct
appeal
requiring
review
of
the
entire
record
means
that
it's
at
least
as
burdensome,
if
not
more
burdensome.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
well,
we
believe
there
already
is
a
deference
inherent
in
the
brown
v.
allen
decision,
but
the
deference
is
not
a
deference
to
say
that
we'll
back
off
and
a
reasonable
application
of
federal
law
by
state
courts
is
what
the
defendant
in
this
particular
case
was
entitled
to.
we
believe
that
the
federal
court
should
take,
for
what
it's
worth,
the
state
court
determination,
but
the
federal
court
has,
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
a
duty
and
an
obligation
to
review
the
federal
constitutional
rights
that
are
involved
and
to
make
the
right
decision
at
that
point.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
would
radically
change
the
law
of
federal
habeas
corpus
from
the
way
it
has
been
for
the
last,
i
would
suggest,
200
years,
that
once
you
reach
the
merits...
once
a
federal
district
court
or
a
federal
court
is
supposed
to
reach
the
merits
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
that
it's
supposed
to
apply
the
same
rules
that
it
would
apply
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
well,
in
one
sense
there
are
very
few
questions
of
law,
for
example,
now,
that
are
cognizable
in
habeas
corpus
at
least
in
terms
of
new
cases
since
the
teague
rule
establishes
that
we
have
to
simply
take
the
case
of
law,
applying
existing
legal
rules,
so
in
effect
you'd
be
closing
the
doors
to
virtually
all
federal
habeas
corpus
over
state
courts,
were
you
to
adopt
a
rule
that
does
what
you're
suggesting.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
but
harmless
error
is...
the
harmless
error
determination
speaks
to
virtually
all
constitutional
violations
except
for
those
few
categories
where
it's
an
automatic
reversal
rule,
so
it
doesn't
just
speak
to
doyle
violations,
it
speaks
to
miranda
violations,
to
sixth
amendment...
other
kinds
of
sixth
amendment
or
seventh
amendment
violations.
there's
no
way
of
saying
that
doyle
is
in
any
way
unique
in
terms
of
these
kinds
of
things.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
okay.
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
thank
you,
chief
justice.
let
me
state
first
that
the
rule
in
chapman
is
not
based
upon
any
particular
statute.
it
was
an
attempt
by
this
court
to
devise
what
it
described
in
the
decision
itself
as
a
federal
right
or
a
federal
rule,
and
it
appears
it
may
be
a
constitutional
rule
because
it's
so
closely
allied
with
the
enforcement
of
constitutional
rights,
but
it
certainly...
chapman
certainly
was
not
interpreting
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statutes
itself,
because
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statutes
weren't
involved.
that
came
later,
although
a
case
was
argued
4
days
before
chapman
was
announced,
the
first
case
in
which
justice
black
indicated
that
chapman
ought
to
apply
in
federal
habeas
corpus,
but
it's
at
least
until
1970
that
the
first,
if
you
will,
majority
of
the
court
in
collective
different
decisions
indicated
that
chapman
applied
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
as
far
as
i
can
find.
the
standards
in
jackson
are
completely
inappropriate
for
this
kind
of
a
case.
jackson
assumes
that
the
jury
fact-finding
is
untainted
by
any
error
and
then
looks
at
the
result
of
that
fact-finding
to
see
whether
that
fact-finding
is
so
out
of
the
realm
of
permissibility
that
it
has
to
be
overturned.
we're
talking
here
about
a
case
where
constitutional
error
clearly
occurred,
and
we
submit
it
had
a
direct
truth-finding
relationship
to
the
jury
fact-finding,
so
you
start
off
with
a
tainted
jury
determination.
how
much
that
taint...
i
almost
heard,
and
i
don't
think
i
heard
correctly,
but
i
almost
heard
that
the
question
was
a
question
of
percentage.
did
it
have
a
5
percent
or
20
percent
difference
in
terms
of
the
verdict?
we
can't
tell.
the
jury
is
in
the
jury
room.
only
it
knows.
indeed,
only
an
individual
jury
member
can
know
how
much
a
particular
factual
inference
or
fact
had
in
relationship
to
that
jury
member's
determination
of
what
the
vote
should
be.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
think
that's
error.
i
think
the
duty
on
the--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--they
may
know
more,
or
they
may
know
less
in
a
particular
case.
may
i
finish?
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
particular
application
is
something
that
we
can't
tell
about,
and
that's
the
essence
of
it.
the
duty
is
the
federal
court's
duty
to
make
what
it...
is
the
right
decision
under
the
existing
federal
law,
which
includes
the
chapman
standard
in
this
case.
