ms.
sally
l.
wellman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may
try
to
clarify
a
factual
point
first,
at
pages
7
through
9
of
our
brief
with
appropriate
cites
to
the
transcript
and
the
joint
appendix,
we
do
quote
each
of
the
remarks
that
were
found
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
the
district
court,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
to
be
doyle
violations.
there
was
some
ambiguity
initially
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
had
been
given
his
miranda
rights
at
any
earlier
point
in
time,
the
ambiguity
earlier
than
the
initial
appearance.
the
ambiguity
came
about
only
because
everyone
involved
in
his
arrest
and
immediate
proceedings
thereafter
did
not
testify,
but
there
never
was
any
testimony
that
he
did
receive
his
miranda
warnings
before
his
initial
appearance.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
therefore
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
he
did
not
receive
his
miranda
rights
until
his
initial
appearance.
that
is
a
factual
finding
binding
on
the
federal
courts
which
has
not
been
challenged
by
petitioner.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
before.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
yes,
we
think
she
is
wrong
on
that
one.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
the
others,
the
only
violation,
however...
and
i
would
like
to
make
this
clear...
is
the
prosecutor
at
no
time
singled
out
the
post-miranda
silence.
the
only
thing
he
did
wrong
was
speak
a
little
too
broadly,
so
that
in
asking
questions
or
commenting,
he
used
words
like,
isn't
this
the
first
time
you
ever,
and
isn't
it
true
that
you
never,
and
those
words
got
him
into
trouble
because
they
encompassed
both
the
pre-miranda
and
the
post-miranda,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was
a
ton
of
pre-miranda
silence
and
conduct
that
was
very,
very
probative
of
guilt,
such
as
him
fleeing
the
scene
and
stealing
the
victim's
car,
and
heading
for
the
state
line,
instead
of
calling
for
help,
which
one
would
expect
if
it
had
been
an
accidental
shooting.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
what
standard
should
be
applied
to
use
to
determine
when
a
federal
habeas
court
should
release
a
state
prisoner
on
habeas?
obviously,
federal
habeas
review
of
final
state
court
convictions
is
a
statutory
remedy,
so
we
look
first
to
the
statute
itself
to
see
if
it
tells
us
when
relief
should
be
granted.
it
does
not.
the
statute
2254
does
not
say
anything
about
relief
per
se,
or
harmless
error,
or
error
per
se.
the
only
guidance
we
find
is
the
terminology
in
224
that
a
federal
court
may
not
entertain
a
petition
unless
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
person
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
the
language
in
2243
that
the
habeas
court
shall
dispose
of
the
matter
as
law
and
justice
require.
because
the
statute
has
not
defined
when
relief
is
required,
this
court
must
do
so,
and
it
is
not
legislating
for
this
court
to
do
so.
this
court
has
an
obligation...
when
there
is
a
broad
grant
of
jurisdiction
and
a
broad
legislative
grant
that
does
not
fill
in
the
details
and
the
definitions
this
court
has
an
obligation
to
do
so,
and
it
does
so,
of
course,
by
looking
at
the
purpose
underlying
the
statute.
it's
very
clear,
of
course,
that
in
habeas
the
purpose
is
twofold.
there
are
two
constitutional
principles
at
issue.
the
first,
of
course,
is
federalism,
and
the
second
is
the
duty
to
protect
federal
constitutional
rights.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
in
stone
v.
powell
and
a
number
of
other
cases
two
primary
points
about
federalism.
the
first
is,
of
course,
that
the
states
are
sovereigns.
they
have
the
duty
and
responsibility
and
power
to
define
and
punish
crime,
and
they
may
do
so
without
federal
interference
unless,
of
course,
by
doing
so
they
violate
federal
constitutional
rights.
the
court
has
also
repeatedly
and
properly
recognized
that
it
is
the
state
courts
that
are
the
primary
enforces
and
protectors
of
federal
constitutional
rights,
and
they
are
every
bit
as
able,
capable,
and
competent
as
the
federal
courts
to
do
so,
so
it's
clear--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--that's
right,
no
exception.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
it's
clear
to
us,
then,
that
what
habeas
is
is
an
equitable,
special,
extraordinary
remedy
to
step
in
in
those
few
cases
where
in
spite
of
their
duty
and
their
best
efforts
to
do
so,
the
state
courts
have
failed
to
adequately
protect
federal
constitutional
rights.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
chapman
harmless
error
standard
is
a
proper
measure
of
when
that
extraordinary
step
should
be
taken.
chapman
is
perfectly
appropriate
on
direct
review
to
say
that
the
state
shall
not
profit
from
its
error
unless
it
can
show
there
was
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
error
contributed
to
the
verdict,
but
that
is
a
very
high
standard.
it's
just
short
of
automatic
reversal,
and
on
direct
review
it
serves
many
functions.
it
serves
an
educative
function,
a
deterrent
function.
you
set
a
very
high
risk
of
violating
the
constitution,
and
that
encourages
state
prosecutors
and
police
and
judges
to
take
care
in
imposing
and
following
the
constitutional
rules,
but
that
same
high
level
is
not
necessary
on
the
collateral
review
of
habeas.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
no,
we
do
not.
we
have
not
seen
that
as
implicated
in
this
case.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
have
not
thought
about
that
as
a
separate
matter.
we
have
not
seen
it
as
having
any
implication
as
to
federal
review
of
a
state
conviction,
no,
on
either
direct
review
to
this
court
or
on
federal
habeas,
but
as
i
say,
i've
not
considered
that
so
i
may
be
missing
something.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
because
this
court
has
mandated
through
chapman
that
the
state
courts
themselves
shall
apply
the
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
think
that
you
look
at
the
costs
and
balances
between
whether
that
additional
benefit
of
applying
the
highest...
or
nearly
the
highest
standard
of
review,
gives
any
added
benefit
on
collateral
review
as
opposed
to,
of
course,
the
obvious
significant...
more
costs
on
collateral
review,
and
what
we're
saying
is
we
don't
think
it's
realistic
to
think
that
state
prosecutors
or
judges
or
police
are
going
to
be
willing
to
take
a
risk
that
might
overturn
a
conviction
when
chapman
is
applied
in
their
state
courts
just
because
they
know
that
on
federal
habeas
a
lesser
standard
will
be...
a
less
stringent
standard
will
be
applied.
so
we
think
that
it
does
provide
adequate
deterrence
to
enforce
the
rules
in
the
first
place
on
the
state
courts
by
mandating
that
they
apply
the
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
standard
themselves
on
review,
and
then
to
have
habeas
review
as
a
back-up,
but
you
don't
need
such
a
high
standard
of...
of
review.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
think
so,
in
combination
with
the
other
factors,
which
of
course
is
primarily
that
chapman
is
applied
on
direct
review.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
he
did
not
seek
cert
in
this
case.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
we
believe
that
habeas
should
be
limited
to
those
situations
in
which
it
can
be
said
that
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
fundamental
fairness,
that
somehow
the
error
is
not
just
error
that
we
cannot
prove
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
that
it
is
error
that
so
infected
the
entire
trial
that
the
conviction
itself
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
one
way
to
state
that
is
the
way
that
justice
stevens
stated
in
miller
v.
greer
and
rose
v.
lundy,
which
is
that
errors
that
are
so
fundamental
that
they
infect
the
validity
of
the
underlying
judgment
itself
should
be
granted
relief.
we
think
that
that
is
an
appropriate
view,
but
it
does
not
give
a
measuring
stick,
it
doesn't
tell
lower
courts
how
to
figure
out
when
we
have
reached
that
level,
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
any
of
the
three
tests
that
we
have
proposed,
either
kotteakos,
which
the
7th
circuit
used,
or
our
jackson
v.
virginia
formulation,
or
our
strickland
formulation,
would
be
an
adequate
test.
it
would
be
sufficient
to
identify
those
cases
where
the
conviction
and
the
resulting
custody
have
truly
deprived
the
defendant
of
fundamental
fairness
as
opposed
to
those
constitutional
trial
errors
that
we
simply
cannot
prove
are
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
that's
true.
that
is--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--that
is
the
least
protective.
we
think
it
is
still
consistent
with
habeas
because
what
we're
saying
is,
if
you
can
take
the
infected
or
bad
material
out
and
you
still
have
sufficient
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
you
cannot
say
that
the
state
really
depended
on
that...
that
they
could
not
have
a
conviction
without
that
evidence,
but
we
agree
that
either
kotteakos
or
strickland
would
serve
the
same
purpose
and
yet
be
more
protective
or
more...
give
more
credence
to
the
risk
that
even
though
yes,
the
state
could
prove
its
case
without
that
evidence,
that
evidence
might
have
influenced
the
verdict.
so
all
of
these
really
are
sort
of
on
a
continuum
of
looking
at
what
would
have
happened
if
this
error
hadn't
occurred,
and
how
much
risk
of
error
are
we
willing
to
take?
the
automatic
reversal
rule--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--and
that
the
state
has
not
been
able
to
prove
that
error
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
it's
a
constitutional
rule
in
the
sense
that...
i
don't
think
that
in
chapman
this
court
would
have
had
to
adopt
that
test
as
the
test
for
harmless
error.
it
has
also
a
deterrent
purpose
and
an
educative
purpose.
i
mean,
i
think
courts
have
chosen
a
lesser
test
in
chapman
as
well,
or
have
chosen
no
test
and
said
no,
as
justice
harlan
suggested,
we
will
just
look
to
see
whether
whatever
harmless
error
test
the
state
is
imposing
is
consistent
with
due
process.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
sure.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
well,
i
think
it
does,
because
i
think
you
have
to
remember
that
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals
also
found
all
the
pre-miranda
references
to
be
error.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
but
i
believe
in
doing
that
they
meant
to
include
the...
i
mean,
they
thought
they
were
applying
the
chapman
standard.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
that's
right,
the
7th
circuit
used
kotteakos.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
yes,
it
did.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
yes,
it--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--right.
you
have
to--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--well--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--yes,
and
i
think
he
did
so.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
yes,
definitely.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i'm
sorry,
i--
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
--oh.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
right.
i
think
that
the
district
court
erred
in
how
it
applied
chapman
as
well,
because
it
seemed
to
think
that
the
only
way
you
could
meet
chapman
is
to
find
overwhelming
evidence,
and
we
don't
think
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
that's
what
accounts
for
the
difference
between
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
the
district
court,
so
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
means
because
we
do
have
this
history
of
different
courts,
each
overturning
the
one
before
it,
that
it
means
that
this
was
that
close
of
a
case.
i
think
that
would
be
not
necessarily
the
inference
to
draw.
i
think
what
we
are
searching
for
in
this
case
is
a
standard
that
will
permit
us
to
limit
habeas
relief
to
those
cases
where
law
and
justice
truly
require
that
it
be
granted,
and
the
way
to
measure
that
is
to
look
at
a
broad
sense
at
causality.
did
the
error,
did
the
constitutional
violation
cause
this
person
to
be
in
custody,
and
at
what
level
or
degree
or
likelihood
is
a
fair
measure
of
that
on
collateral
relief,
where
the
petitioner
has
had
full
review,
appellate
review
in
the
states
below,
and
the
petition
can
be
brought
at
any
time,
therefore,
of
course,
putting
the
state
to
great
disadvantage
in
terms
of
being
able
to
reprove
the
case
if
that
should
become
necessary
or
to
prove
underlying
errors
that
may
be
raised.
we
think
that
the
constitution
and
the
criminal
justice
system
of
course
protect
other
values
besides
guilt
or
innocence,
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
any
of
these
three
tests
would
protect
only
guilt
or
innocence.
the
other
values
of
the
constitution,
such
as
doyle
itself,
it
protects
something
that
is
not
just
a
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
a
question
of
fairness.
we
think
the
government
has
to
treat
the
petitioner
fairly.
you
can't
tell
him
one
thing
and
then
double-cross
him
at
trial,
but
that
value
is
fully
served
by
applying
the
doyle
rule
in
the
first
place
and
secondly
requiring
the
state
courts
to
apply
the
chapman
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
test.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
think
the
probativeness
is
the
same.
i
think
it's
really
the
fairness
that
is
at
issue.
to
the
extent
that
a
person...
it's
less
probative
because
the
person
might
be
relying
on
the
miranda
rights
as
opposed
to
making
up
this
cockamamie
story.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
no,
i
think
two
inferences
can
be
drawn.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
it
might
be,
just
like
any
other
evidence
that
is
ambiguous,
or
from
which
two
inferences
might
be
seen
as
less
probative,
but
that
isn't
the
reason
that
we
don't
let
it
in,
i
don't
think.
that's
why
this
court
was
able
to
say
that
pre-miranda
silence
can
come
in,
that
it's
not
just
the
probative
value
but
it's
the
fairness
element.
ms.
sally
l.
wellman
i
think
so.
i
think
so,
so
i
don't
think
that
it
hinges
on
miranda
per
se.
i
mean,
i
think
in
a
situation
where,
for
example,
miranda
was
not
required
because
the
person
was
not
in
custody,
if
nonetheless
he
was
told
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
then
that
silence
was
used
against
him,
i
think
that
could
be
held
to
be
unfair,
so
in
that
sense
we
do
depart
from
judge
easterbrook.
we
agree
with
him
that
a
different
standard
should
be
used
on
habeas
because
of
all
the
differences
between
direct
review
and
collateral
review,
but
we
don't
focus
it
on
it
being
because
doyle
is
prophylactic,
because
there
are...
it
is
prophylactic
to
some
extent,
but
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
prophylactic
as
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
exclusionary
rules
are.
we
believe
that
either
the
kotteakos
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict
test
or
our
jackson
formulation
or
a
strickland
type
of
formulation
that
would
require
a
showing
of
a
reasonable
probability
that
but
for
the
error
the
result
would
have
been
different
are
all
adequate
to
protect
the
defendant's
federal
constitutional
rights
and
to
pick
up
those
cases
where
the
state
courts,
even
though
they
had
a
duty
to
protect
those
rights,
and
we
can
assume
strove
to
do
so,
nonetheless
failed.
we
also
believe
that
any
of
these
three
tests
would
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
interest
of
federalism
and
the
interest
of
the
state
as
a
sovereign
and
its
interest
in
its
final
state
judgments.
therefore,
we
