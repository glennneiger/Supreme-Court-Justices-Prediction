justice
byron

white
so
it
isn't
a
fifth
amendment
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
doyle...
which
is
doyle.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
the
standard
they
applied...
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
chapman
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
happened
in
the
district
court
on
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
disagreed
with
the
state
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
applied
a
lower
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
court
specifically
accepted
the
facts,
the
historical
facts
of
the
state
court,
but
then
said
that
whether
a
constitutional
error
is
harmless
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
it
is
not
subject
to
the
presumption
of
correctness
given
to
the
state
court's
findings
of
fact,
and
it
cited...
it
cited
a
court
of
appeals
case
in
the
7th
circuit
which
in
turn
cited
harrington
v.
california.
that
was
a
direct
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
question
of
law
or
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
court
in
granting
habeas
certainly
identified
the
post-miranda
statements
that
he
relied
on
as
saying
that
it
might
have
made
a
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose...
we
denied
cert
in
this
case,
did
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
going
to
be
very,
very
few
convictions,
state
convictions
that
would
be
upset
on
federal
habeas
under
the
jackson
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
know
that
from
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what...
on
direct
review,
suppose
we
reverse
a
case
and
find,
contrary
to
the
state
court,
that
this
was
not
harmless
error,
and
so
there's
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
what
is
our
judgment
based
upon,
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
a...
it's
a
constitutional
rule,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
apply
it,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
made
a
difference
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
least...
and
when
it
got
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
had
to
act
contrary
to
what
it
did
originally.
it
dismissed
the
petition
for
cert...
or,
the
petition
for
habeas,
federal
habeas.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
consistent
with
the
court
of
appeals
ruling--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
dismissed
the
petition
for...
denied
federal
habeas.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
silence
after
miranda
rulings
has
the
same
significance
as
before
the
warnings?
is
it
as
probative
of
guilt?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
less
probative.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
only
might...
it
only
might
be
less
probative.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
next
question,
i
suppose,
is
that
there
are
historical
facts
to
be
considered
and
then
there's
a
question
of
law
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
district
court
purported
to
do
just
that.
it
gave
complete
deference
to
the
historical
fact
findings
of
the
state
court--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
then
said
that
the
ultimate
judgment
of
harmlessness
is
a
question
of
law.
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well...
mixed
question.
what
do
you
mean
by
a
mixed
question?
isn't
it
just
the
inferences
that
are
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judgment
of
harmlessness,
isn't
it
a
question
of
law?
it's
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts,
i
suppose.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that's
a
question
of
law,
i
would
think.
you
can
have
something
that's
genuinely
a
mixture
of
legal
issues
and
factual
issues,
and
those
are
what
are
called
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
well,
is
it
any
difference
in
deciding
whether
a
confession
is
voluntary
or
involuntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
be
error
if
the
district
judge
on
federal
habeas
said
well,
this
is
an
awfully
close
case,
i
probably
would
have
come
out
differently
in
deciding
harmlessness
than
the
state
supreme
court
did,
but
it's
a
close
case
and
i'll
just
go
along
with
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
state
courts
may
know
an
awful
lot
more
about
what
might
affect
the
jury
in
their
state
than
some
federal
panel,
or
some
district
judge?
