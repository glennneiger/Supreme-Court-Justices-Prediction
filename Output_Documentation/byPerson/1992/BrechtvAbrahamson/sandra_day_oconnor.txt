do
you
think
that
a
federal
court
on
habeas
owes
some
deference
to
state
court
findings
as
in
this
case
that
the
error
was
harmless?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
the
state
court
is
presumably
in
a
better
position
to
make
that
determination
than
the
federal
court.
i
wonder
why
deference
to
those
findings
isn't
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
you
suppose
we
don't
apply
a
rule
that
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
due
process
violation
in
the
first
instance
you
have
to
examine
whether
there's
been
any
harm
done?
why
shouldn't
the
harmless
inquiry
occur
at
the
level
of
determining
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
in
the
first
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
would
be
typical.
in
some
cases
we've
done
exactly
that,
have
we
not?
