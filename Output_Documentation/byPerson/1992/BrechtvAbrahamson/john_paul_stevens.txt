justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
another...
at
least
an
unresolved
matter
of
fact,
and
that's
whether
or
not
he
received
miranda
warnings
before
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
mentioned
when
he
was
at
the
first...
apparently
after
he
had
been
arrested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
his
initial
appearance
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record
about
getting
miranda
warnings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
there
some
uncertainty...
incidentally,
in
your
brief
you
quote
the
erroneous
statements
by
the
prosecutor.
is
that
a
complete...
are
those
all
the
erroneous
statements
that
you
rely
on,
those
at
pages
3
and
4
of
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
could
read
at
least
several
of
those
as
not
necessarily
referring
to
the
time
after
his
initial
appearance,
because
they're
talking
about
contacts
with
the
police,
and
i
take
it
those
contacts
might
have
been
before
his
initial
appearance
and
therefore
before,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
got
miranda
warnings.
there's
some
ambiguity,
is
all
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
didn't
have
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
jury
didn't
have
a
question
put
to
it
that
raised
the
doyle
issue,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
weren't
asked
when
were
miranda
warnings
given,
or
was
he
silent
before
or
after
he
got
miranda
warnings.
they
weren't
asked
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
see,
some
of
these
statements
about
the...
he
didn't
say
anything
until
he
bumped
into
the...
at
the
time
he
talked
to
the
police.
i
don't
have
the
exact
language,
but
i
can't
tell
from
the
papers
whether
that's
before
or
after
he
got
miranda
warnings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
exactly
what
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
see,
to
the
extent
that
it's
unclear,
it's
not
quite
as
clear
as
we
assumed
at
the
outset
that
any
promise
was
broken.
you
see,
if
they're
pre-miranda
warning
statements,
your
argument
about
breaking
a
promise
is
not
really
valid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
was
the
questioning
by
officer
papke
before
or
after
the
initial
appearance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
district
court
thought
that
questioning
was
post-miranda
warnings.
judge
crabb
thought
that
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
to
comment
on
this
thought--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
question
of
the
difference
between
the
harmless...
the
chapman
standard
and
the
kotteakos
standard.
the
intermediate
court
in
wisconsin
apparently
applied...
has
found
prejudice,
which
would
have
found
a
violation
of
kotteakos,
unanimously.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
unanimously
found
harmless
error
under
the
chapman
standard,
and
the
district...
i
wonder
if
the
standard
made
any
difference
to
any
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
but
they
did
not
apply
the
chapman
standard.
they
said
there
was
prejudice,
as
i...
if
i
read
the
opinion
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
tell
that
from
the
opinion.
they
don't
cite
it.
they
don't
cite
any
federal
cases
on
that
point.
well,
what
did
the...
did
the...
what
did
the
7th
circuit...
it
used
the
kotteakos
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
judge
easterbrook
said,
but
then
he
also
said
he
didn't
want
to
trudge
through
the
record,
so
i'm
not
sure
he
thought
he
should
trudge
through
the
record
under
either
standard.
well,
you
have
to
do
it
under
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
seems
to
think
under
one
you
trudge
through
the
record
and
under
the
other
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think...
they
did
have
the
duty
to
look
at
the
entire
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
under
kotteakos.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
barr,
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that's
true
in
those
cases
that
have
been
automatic
reversals
such
as
total
denial
of
counsel,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
general
barr,
in
your...
in
the
notion
of
deference,
do
you
think
it
is
part
of
the
duty
of
the
federal
court
to
read
the
entire
record
under
either
standard,
kotteakos
or
chapman?
