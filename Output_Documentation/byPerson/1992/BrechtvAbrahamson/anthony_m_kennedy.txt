justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
your
explanation
for
the
phenomenon
that
the
rule
on
2255
in
federal
habeas,
the
standard
of
review,
seems
to
differ
from
that
of
chapman--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
why
should
this
be,
if
there
is
this
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
standard
for
determining
whether
or
not
there's
reversible
error?
should
the
standard
be
the
same
in
both
proceedings,
state
habeas
and
2255,
or
federal
habeas
to
a
state
proceeding
on
the
one
hand
and
2255?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
would
indicate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
would
indicate
that
we
would
have
a
broader
standard
of
review
over
a
federal
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
what
those
different
considerations
are,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
at
root
is
the
proposition
or
the
premise
that
state
courts
are
not
as
adept
or
as
capable
as
enforcing
federal
rights
of
determining
them
as
the
federal
courts
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
willing
to
submit
the
argument
on
the
theory
that
state
courts
are
as
adept
and
as
capable
and
as
willing
to
enforce
federal
rights
as
federal
courts
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
not
at
issue,
are
you
willing
to
put
the
argument
on
that
basis?
are
you
willing
to
accept
that
as
a
premise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
applying
those
rights
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
conviction
should
be
reversed
under
a
chapman
standard
or
some
other
standard,
aren't
the
state
courts
in
an
equal
or
better
position
than
the
federal
courts
to
make
that
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
the
difference
one
of
competence
between
the
two
types
of
tribunals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
give
no
effect,
then,
to
28
u.s.c.
2111
with
reference
to
direct
review
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
chapman
decision
is
correct,
in
your
view,
and
the
federal
statute
under...
that
i've
cited
is
irrelevant
to
that
determination
and
to
that
rule.
