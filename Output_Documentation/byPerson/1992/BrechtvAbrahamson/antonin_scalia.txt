mr.
shoenberger,
he
wasn't
explicitly
told
that
if
he
remained
silent
that
silence
would
not
be
used
against
him,
was
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
explicit
statement
in
this
case.
you're
just
relying
upon
the
general
inference
from
a
miranda
warning.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
if
we
told
him
you
have
a
right
to
make
a
confession,
and
then
his
making
of
a
confession,
if
we
used
the
confession
against
him,
that
would
be
unfair
too,
right?
