mr.
william
p.
barr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
harmless
error
standard
that
should
apply
on
collateral
review
of
constitutional
errors
is
the
traditional
kotteakos
standard.
the
kotteakos
rule
is
the
traditional
formulation
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine
derived
from
the
common
law
approach
which
later
found
its
way
into
the
federal
statutes
of
1919
and
1949
and
now
the
federal
rules.
chapman
is
the
exception
to
that
traditional
doctrine,
and
in
chapman
this
court
formed
a
stricter,
a
ratcheted
up
harmless
error
standard,
and
in
that
context,
on
direct
review
of
constitutional
errors,
that
ratcheted-up
standard
serves
a
deterrent
function
promoting
rigorous
adherence
to
constitutional
norms
at
the
trial
phase.
now,
we
submit
that
this
should
not
be
carried
over
to
collateral
review,
the
chapman
standard,
and
this
court
has
never
directly
addressed
this
issue.
we
think
there
are
three
reasons
for
this.
first,
kotteakos
fully
effectuates
the
purposes
of
habeas
corpus.
habeas
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
full
replay
of
direct
review,
and
there
should
be
no
presumption
that
the
rules
and
the
standards
that
apply
on
direct
review
necessarily
carry
over
to
habeas
corpus
review,
and
for
that
reason
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
rules
that
apply
on
habeas
should
be
tailored
to
the
purposes
of
habeas,
and
may
be
different
than
the
rules
and
the
standards
that
apply
in
direct
review.
now,
the
core
purpose
of
habeas
is
to
protect
against
the
kind
of
serious
constitutional
defect
that
gives
rise
to
a
substantial
risk
that
an
innocent
person
has
been
convicted,
and
kotteakos
is
fully
sufficient
to
meet
that
standard.
after
all,
it
is
the
rule
that
we
use
on
direct
review
of
nonconstitutional
errors
which
can
be
more
prejudiced
than
many
constitutional
errors
such
as
404(b)
violation,
and
in
that
context
we
rely
upon
the
kotteakos
standard,
whether
there's
been
a
substantial
influence
in
determining
the
jury's
verdict,
to
assure
us--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--no,
justice
stevens.
what
i
would
say
is,
there
are
essentially
three
boxes.
the
first
issue
is,
is
a
claim
reviewable
at
all
under
habeas
corpus,
or
should
it
receive
stone
v.
powell
treatment,
but
if
it's
a
cognizable
claim,
the
next
issue
is,
is
it
automatically
reversible,
and
there
may
be
some
debates
about
that
test,
but
i
don't
think
doyle
meets
that
test,
and
that
would
put,
then,
doyle
in
the
subject-to-harmless-error
analysis
box.
so
if
we
can
rely
on
kotteakos
on
the
direct
review
of
nonconstitutional
errors
to
sort
out
the
reliability
of
the
verdict,
i
think
we
can
rely
upon
it
in
habeas
corpus
context.
the
second
reason,
i
think,
that
we
shouldn't
just
carry
over
the
chapman
standard,
is
that
the
benefits
of
chapman...
and
this
goes
to
your
comments,
justice
souter...
the
benefits
of
chapman
are
largely
achieved
on
direct
review.
it's
the
presence--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--that...
the...
if
it
doesn't
perform
a
deterrent
function
on
direct
review,
then
what's
the
purpose--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--that
question
boils
down
to
this:
will
a
prosecutor
facing
chapman
on
direct
review
through
the
state
system
and
potentially
on
cert
in
the
federal
system
really
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
constitution
because
he
may
be
facing
down
the
road
on
collateral
review
kotteakos
rather
than
chapman?
mr.
william
p.
barr
well,
the
kotteakos
standard
has
worked
for
nonconstitutional
errors,
which
can
be
just
as
prejudicial
as
a
constitutional
error,
and
it's
also
essentially
the
standard
that
we
use...
the
kotteakos
standard,
whether
there's
a
substantial
probability
of
prejudice...
is
the
standard
we
use
on
donnelly
v.
dechristoforo
potential
due
process
violations
in
the
state
system,
it's
the
standard
we
use
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
the
strickland
case,
although
the
burden
is
shifted
by
strickland
and
dechristoforo.
so
it
hasn't...
there's
no
evidence
that
has
led
to
a
breakdown
of
the
state
criminal
justice
system
or
ignoring
or
flouting
constitutional
standards.
while
the
benefit,
we
maintain,
of
carrying
over
the
chapman
rule
to
collateral
review
is
slight,
if
any,
from
a
deterrence
standpoint,
we
believe
the
costs
are
high.
overturning
final
criminal
convictions
for
errors
that
did
not
substantially
influence
the
outcome
of
the
case
derogate
from
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
undermine
the
federalism
interest
and
the
interest
in
finality,
and
breeds
disrespect
for
the
criminal
justice
system
as
a
whole.
now,
there
is
no
constitutional
or
statutory
command
to
select
either
the
chapman
standard
or
the
kotteakos
standard
under
habeas
corpus.
we
see
no
constitutional
reason
for
doing
it,
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
statute
dictating
the
selection
of
one
or
the
other
of
those
standards,
and
therefore
it's
a
prudential
matter
as
to
how
much
respect
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
federalism
interest,
the
interest
in
finality,
and
so
it
is
a
prudential
decision,
and
we
maintain
that
the
best
balance
is
struck
by
selection
of
the
kotteakos
standard.
now,
to
answer
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
raised
at
the
outset,
as
you
know,
we
argued
in
wright
v.
west
that
there
should
be
deference
given
to
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
we
believe
that
this
kind
of
judgment,
the
determination
of
harmlessness,
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
akin
to
a
sufficiency
determination,
and
as
you
know,
we
argued
there
that
that
should
be
given
deference.
the
court
did
not
reach
that
issue,
but
if
deference
were
given
here,
then
we
belief
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
p.
barr
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
william
p.
barr
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
i
think
it's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
mr.
william
p.
barr
it's
a
determination--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--well,
here,
justice
white,
the
record
is
before
the
court,
and
the
court
has
to
make
a
judgment--
mr.
william
p.
barr
--as
to
whether
or
not
that
jury
was
influenced
by
the
error
in
the
case
and
whether
it
had
some
kind
of
determining
influence
on
the
verdict,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
mixed
question.
mr.
william
p.
barr
yes,
i
do,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
kotteakos
case
discusses
that
extensively,
the
obligations
of
the
court.
the...
so
it's
our
position
that
if
a
claim
is
cognizable
under
habeas,
and
if
it's
subject
to
harmless
error
review,
then
one
standard
should
apply,
and
that
is
the
kotteakos
standard.
now,
in
this
case,
as
i
indicated,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
plausible
argument
that
this
is
the
kind
of
fundamental
or
structural
defect
that
puts
it
into
the
automatic
reversal
category.
mr.
william
p.
barr
there
is
an
argument
for,
obviously,
limiting
it
to
the
doyle
case
or
just
deciding
the
doyle
case
here,
based
on
what
the
purpose
of
the
doyle
rule
is.
is
it
a
truth-seeking
rule,
or
is
it
not
a
truth-seeking
rule?
does
the
violation
of
the
rule,
therefore,
undermine
our
confidence
directly
in
the
reliability
of
the
verdict?
and
if
those
considerations
are
taken
into
account,
then
a
more
limited
holding
could
be
issued.
mr.
william
p.
barr
no.
i
don't
think
that
the
truth-seeking
or
the
nontruth-seeking
distinction
for
harmless
error
analysis
should
generate
two
different
harmless
error
rules.
i
think
that
distinction
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
rule
is
automatically...
the
error
is
automatically
reversible,
or
whether
it's
subject
to
harmless
error
at
all.
