justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
true,
isn't
it,
every
court
that's
dealt
with
this
so
far
has
found
a
doyle
violation,
so
that's
the...
the
premise
for
your
argument
is
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
it
was
found
to
be
error
and
harmless
error
in
the
state
appellate
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
argument
that
there
isn't
much
of
an
implication
for
the
deterrent
function
of
habeas
or
for
the
need
for
such
a
high
standard,
given
the
deterrent
function
of
habeas.
the
fact
is,
most
state
convictions
are
not
reviewed
on
direct
review
at
all.
we
don't
grant
many
cert
petitions
out
of
state
supreme
courts,
so
the
fact
is,
whatever
effect
federal
jurisdiction
generally
has
on
state
practice
is
an
effect
that
is
a
function
of
habeas.
why,
therefore,
shouldn't
the
standard
be
just
as
high
as
it
would
be
on
direct
review,
otherwise
we're
going
to
have
a
much
lesser
deterrent
function.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
mandates
that
the
state
court
shall
apply
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
but
we
don't
therefore
necessarily
adopt
a
lesser
standard
on
collateral
review
in
determining
what's
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
fact
that
our
direct
review
is
necessarily
as
limited
as
it
is
really,
in
your
judgment,
is
nonetheless
a
sufficient
interrorum
deterrence
mechanism.
justice
david
h.
souter
how,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
do
we
know
that?
you
say
that.
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
sure
it
performs
some,
but
again,
given
the
fact
that
to
the
extent
that
a
federal...
that
the
guarantee
of
the
federal
system
is
an
element
at
some
point
in
enforcing
the
chapman
standard,
and
given
the
fact
that
direct
review
by
a
federal
court
is
extraordinarily
limited,
how
do
we
know,
as
matter
of
fact,
that
a
substantial
deterrent
function
is
being
performed
by
direct
review
alone,
and
it
will
not
be
sacrificed
if
we
adopt
a
lesser
standard
on
collateral?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
you
can
focus
it
on
the
prosecutor
only
if
you,
i
suppose,
limit
your
argument
in
this
case
to
the
application
of
the
kotteakos
standard
in
a
doyle
case
and
not
to
habeas
generally.
but
even
aside
from
that,
it
isn't
merely
the
prosecutor
whom
we
are
supposedly
influencing,
it's
the
state
courts,
and
i
think
one
of
the
questions
about
deterrence
that
has
to
be
asked
is
whether
the
state
courts
will
simply
as
a
fact
feel
as
great
a
need
to
be
on
their
toes
if
there
is
a
lesser
standard
for
the
vast
majority
of
state
cases
that
will
be
reviewed
later
by
a
federal
court,
and
i
don't
see
anything
self-evident
about
your
statement
that
they
will
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
just
one
final
question?
is
there
any
reason
to,
if
we
accept
your
view,
to
confine
the
rule
you
want
to
doyle
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
nothing
essential
in
your
argument
that
confines
it
to
doyle,
really.
