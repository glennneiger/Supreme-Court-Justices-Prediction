chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
91-7358,
todd
a.
brecht
v.
gordon
a.
abrahamson.
mr.
shoenberger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
are
the
sixth
court
to
have
considered
the
question
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
decided,
mr.
shoenberger,
whether
harmless
error
is
a
question
of
law
or
fact,
or
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
such
that
whether
or
not
deference
might
be
due
to
a
state
for
determination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless
we
were
to
say
that
that
is
the
sort
of
determination
by
the
state
court
that
is
entitled
to
some
deference
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
introducing
the
kotteakos
standard.
i'm
suggesting
a
possible
way
that
this
case
could
be
decided
is
that
a
finding
of
harmless
error,
a
determination
to
that
effect
by
the
state
court,
would
be
entitled
to
deference
under
2254
in
the
federal
habeas
proceedings.
it
wouldn't
be
a
different
standard,
but
some
deference
would
be
required
to
the
fact
that
the
state
court
had
reached
that
conclusion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
take
it
for
what
it's
worth,
which
of
course
is
a
somewhat
ambiguous
phrase.
you
can
say,
it
means
no
more
than
if
we
agree
with
it,
we'll
accept
it,
if
we
don't
we'll
reject
it.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
maybe
a
federal
court
is
obliged,
even
if
it
would
not
have
come
out
that
way
itself,
to
say
that
the
state
court
finding
of
harmless
error
shouldn't
be
set
aside.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
concededly
true
on
questions
of
law,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
true
on
other
questions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
don't
see
that...
i
don't
see
that
at
all,
because
all
we're
talking
about
is
a
harmless
error
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shoenberger.
mr.
wellman,
or
ms.
wellman...
pardon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wellman.
general
barr,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
barr.
mr.
shoenberger,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
finish
answering.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shoenberger.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
brecht
against
abrahamson.
in
this
case
petitioner
todd
brecht
was
serving
time
in
a
georgia
prison
when
her
sister
and
her
husband
assumed
temporary
custody
of
him
and
took
him
back
to
their
home
in
alma,
wisconsin.
a
week
later,
brecht
shot
and
killed
his
brother-in-law
and
fled
to
winona,
minnesota
where
he
was
apprehended
by
the
police.
he
was
then
returned
to
wisconsin
and
tried
for
murder
in
the
circuit
court
of
buffalo
county.
at
trial,
brecht
took
the
stand
and
claimed
for
the
first
time
that
the
shooting
was
an
accident.
to
impeach
his
testimony,
the
state
made
several
references
to
his
post-miranda
warning
silence
as
to
the
accidental
nature
of
the
crime
and
everybody
agrees
this
was
a
violation
of
a
case
we
decided
a
number
of
years
called
doyle
against
ohio.
the
jury
returned
of
guilty
verdict.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
upheld
brecht's
conviction
after
concluding
that
the
doyle
error
was
harmless
under
the
standard
of
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
the
case
we
decided
in
chapman
versus
california
some
years
ago.
brecht
then
went
into
the
federal
court
system
and
sought
federal
habeas
relief
and
the
federal
district
court
in
madison
granted
relief
because
it
thought
this
violation
that
takes
place
during
his
trial
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
then
the
state
took
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
and
said
that
on
collateral
review
after
that
convictions
become
final
in
the
state
court
system,
the
proper
standard
for
determining
whether
the
error
was
harmless
is
the
one
set
forth
in
another
case
we
decided
called
kotteakos,
and
the
standard
here
is
more
lenient
than
not
in
the
chapman
standard,
and
applying
this
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
doyle
violation
was
harmless.
so
we
are
now
on
the
sixth
court
which
will
consider
this
case.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
kotteakos
harmless
error
standard
rather
than
chapman
standard
applies
in
determining
whether
constitutional
error
of
this
type
may
provide
the
basis
for
federal
habeas
relief.
in
applying
that
standard,
we
conclude
that
brecht
is
not
entitled
to
relief
so
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
is
joined
by
justice
blackmun
in
its
entirety
and
by
justice
souter
in
part;
justices
blackmun,
o'connor,
and
souter
have
also
filed
dissenting
opinion.
