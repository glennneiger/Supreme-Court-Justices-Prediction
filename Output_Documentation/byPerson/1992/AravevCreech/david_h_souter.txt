justice
david
h.
souter
does
this
language
come
out
of
the
model
penal
code?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
thomas,
may
i
just
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
last
question,
because
i'm
not
sure
why
it
would,
why
this
particular
sentence
would
be
consistent
with
your
criterion.
as
i
understand
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
a
murder
would
not
qualify
as
manifesting
utter
disregard
if
it
was
committed
with
any
kind
of
emotional
provocation.
there
is
certainly
evidence
of
that,
and
that
seems
to
be
what
the
trial
judge
found.
so
i
don't,
i
don't
understand
how
it
could
be
consistent.
can
you
explain
that
to
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
though,
i
think
justice
stevens'
question
was
if
we
take
the
trial
judge's
finding
on
its
face
is
this
particular
sentence
consistent
with
your
criterion.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
criterion
is
whether,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
by
the
murder,
which
i
assume,
as
justice
kennedy
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago,
it
means
this
murder
or
circumstances
surrounding
its
commission,
the
defendant
exhibits
utter
disregard.
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
beyond
the
record
and
say
well,
there
are
other,
of
this
case,
for
the
application
of
your
standard.
and
hence
i
don't
see
how
you
can
in
effect
get
around
the
trial
judge's
finding
by
looking
to
circumstances
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
killing.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
can
see
that
as
a
perfectly
relevant
consideration
except
for
one
thing.
your
formulation
of
it
was
that
if
there
is
any
kind
of
emotional
provocation.
your
formulation
does,
in
effect
simply
requires
that
a
provocation
element
be
present,
whatever
else
there
may
be.
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
from
the
trial
judge's
finding,
if
we
accept
it,
that
there
was
some
kind
of
emotional
provocation,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
don't
stop
right
there
and
say
therefore
the
utter
disregard
factor
could
not
be
applied
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
didn't,
the
state
didn't
take
the
position,
i
take
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
in
fact
as
applied
by
a
judge
rather
than
a
jury
it
was
not
constitutionally
vague
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
thomas,
i
don't
see
how
this
is
relevant
to
the
utter
disregard
criteria
because
it
is
written
in
this
way,
by
the
murder
or
circumstances
surrounding
its
commission
the
defendant
exhibits
utter
disregard.
why
does
this,
why
are
the
circumstances
of
other
crimes
entitled
to
consideration
for
the
purposes
that
we're
dealing
with
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
are
other
crimes
relevant
at
all?
are
you
reading
the
utter
disregard
factor
the
way
i
am,
the
murder
refers
to
this
murder,
and
circumstances
surrounding
its
commission
refers
to
the
circumstances
of
this
murder?
are
we
reading
this
the
same
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
should
we
consider
the
circumstances
of
other
crimes?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
for
purposes
of
applying
this
particular
section
for
independent,
in
order
to
discharge
independent
responsibilities,
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
was
this
evidence
put
before
the
trier
of
fact
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
a
conclusion
that
this
was
simply
a
pretext,
that
the
provocation
was
simply
a
pretext?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
pleaded
guilty
here,
didn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
we
know
that
on
remand
the
idaho
supreme
court
is
going
to
rest
the
sentence
on
this
factor,
on
the
particular
aggravating
factor,
circumstance
in
question
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second?
do
you
take
the
position
that
subjective
factors
can
never
be
aggravating
factors?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
this
is
within
the
terminology
that
you're
using.
utter
disregard
is
a
subjective
factor,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
mean,
you're
saying
that
they
have
given
so
many
limiting
definitions
that
there
is
no
limiting
definition.
you're
not
saying,
now
at
least,
that
there
cannot
be
a
valid
limiting
definition
which
is
phrased
in
terms
solely
of
subjective
factors.
