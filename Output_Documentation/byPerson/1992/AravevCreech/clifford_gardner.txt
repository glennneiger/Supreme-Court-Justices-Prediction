mr.
clifford
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
the
broad
request
for
relief
contained
in
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
partially
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
for
a
moment
on
a
procedural
aspect
of
this
case
that
hasn't
yet
garnered
much
attention.
pursuant
to
several
aspects
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
which
are
not
before
the
court
today
this
case
has
been
remanded
and
will
be,
there
will
be
a
resentencing
in
the
idaho
state
court.
thus
i
think
the
narrow
issue
before
this
court
today,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
case
has
been
remanded,
is
the
propriety
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
that
the
osborn
formulation
is
unconstitutional.
and
of
course
as
we
know
from
walton
and
lewis
that
generally
mandates
a
three
or
four-step
inquiry.
is
there
a
valid
limiting
construction
of
an
aggravating
factor,
was
it
applied
in
the
particular
case,
and
if
so,
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
in
fact
support
it.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
the
ninth
circuit
i
think
reached
two
decisions,
your
honor.
the
first
was
that
the
osborn
formulation
itself
did
not
provide
sufficient
guidance,
and
the--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--in
any
case.
and
the
second
was
that
accepting
the
attorney
general's
characterization
of
the
utter
disregard
factor
or
the
cold-blooded
limitation
as
without
emotion,
it
was
not
in
fact
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
believe
that's
an
accurate
characterization
of
the
appellate
court's
opinion.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
your
honor,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
remand
it's
actually
going
back
for
a
full
resentencing
hearing
because
there
was
a
failure
to
allow
any
evidence
in
mitigation.
so
it's
not
in
fact
going
back
to
the
idaho
supreme
court,
it's
going
back
to
the
idaho
trial
court.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
just
to
the
vagueness
question.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
believe
that's
right.
that
is,
the
narrow
issue
before
us
today
is
simply
the
question
of
whether
the
utter--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
don't
believe
that
is
at
issue
in
light
of
the
remand.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
i
think
necessarily,
your
honor,
in
the
context
of
this
case
in
defending
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
on
the
vagueness
issue,
and
perhaps
my
response
to
your
honor's
question
was
somewhat
too
quick,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
can
be
defended
on,
i
believe
on
either
ground,
the
decision
on
the
vagueness
issue
which
is
that
the
utter
disregard
factor
as
formulated
by
osborn
is
vague,
and
its
decision
that
if
it's
not
vague,
if
it
does
mean
without
emotion,
as
the
state
has
contended--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
think
that
is
absolutely
right.
because
there
will
be
a
remand
for
resentencing,
that
is
the
primary
issue
before
the
court.
and
i
think--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
your
honor
is
correct.
the
grant
of
cert
was
limited
to
question
1
presented
in
the
petition.
question
1,
i
have
to
say,
incorporated
a
number
of
sub-issues.
the
first
and
the
most
important
issue
was
in
fact
whether
the
osborn
formulation
is
constitutional,
but
with
that
came
a
number
of
subsidiary
issues,
if
so
was
it
applied,
was
there
sufficient
evidence,
or
was
it
cured
on
appeal.
and
i
suppose
my
point
is
that
in
light
of
the
remand
those
latter
three
issues
i
think
are
less
important
for
this
court's
consideration.
mr.
clifford
gardner
certainly
the
trial
court
found
a
number
of
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
true,
under
the
idaho
scheme
any
one
of
which
is
enough.
the
answer
i
suppose
is
yes
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
turning
then
to
the
question
of
whether
the
osborn
formulation
adequately
channels
the
sentencer's
discretion,
the
parties
below
and
the
ninth
circuit,
and
in
fact
the
eighth
circuit
and
tenth
circuit
in
newlon
v.
armontrout,
moore
v.
clarke,
and
the
original
cartwright
decision
have
all
focused
on
the
distinction
between
subjective
and
objective
criteria.
and
while
i
think
that's
a
useful
distinction
i
think
in
some
ways
with
respect
to
this
factor,
although
it's
accurate,
it
is
a
little
too
broad
to
accurately
describe
the
precise
problem
with
the
utter--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
clifford
gardner
utter
disregard
is
a
subjective
factor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
and
i
think
this
is
precisely
where
i
am
headed,
your
honor,
and
that
is
it's
not
merely
that
utter
disregard
or
that
cold-blooded
is
subjective.
it's
that
if
you
look
at
the
record
actually
before
the
court
in
this
case
you
will
see
that
cold-blooded
can
mean
three
or
four
very
different
things,
and
that
is
the
problem
with--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
there
are
some
subjective
factors
that
in
fact
can
properly
limit
the
sentencer's
discretion.
the
problem
with
cold-blooded
as
one
of
them
is
that
it
is
an
umbrella
term
which
incorporates
several
very
different
concepts.
in
fact
i
think
some
of
the
court's
questions
earlier
today
indicate
that
very
problem.
let
me
illustrate
if
i
can
with
what
i
believe
some
of
those
different
definitions
are.
in
1983
when
this
case
was
first
argued
to
the
idaho
supreme
court
the
attorney
general
of
idaho
defending
the
utter
disregard
factor
in
this
case
said
that
it
applied
to
defendants
who
lacked
the
moral
restraints
against
killing,
lacked
the
moral
precepts
against
killing.
that
was
how
it
was
defended
in
1983.
the
case
came
into
federal
court
and
before
this
court
and
it's
now
defined
as
a
killing
without
emotion,
without
significant
provocation.
now
there
is
a
significant
shift.
those
are
two
very
different
definitions.
in
florida,
of
course
as
we
know
from
the
attorney
general's
briefing
and
from
all
the
briefing
in
the
case,
the
coldness
factor
is
defined
as
something
that
we
call
super
premeditation,
which
is
yet
another
way
to
describe
coldness.
and
so
we
see
in
this
case
that
that,
i
think,
is
the
fundamental
problem
with
using
a
term
like
cold-blooded,
not
merely
that
it
is
subjective,
but
that
it
is
an
umbrella
term
that
can
refer
to
many
different
concepts.
when,
there
is
a
real
practical--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
agree
with
your
honor.
the
problem,
however,
is
that
when
none
of
them
or
even
all
of
them
haven't
been
identified,
then
the,
there's
a
real
practical
side
to
the
problem
which
is
when
you
come
into
court
in
idaho
and
you
have
this
umbrella-like
definition
which
contains
three
or
four
different
possibilities,
the
parties,
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
and
indeed
the
trial
court
who
is
the
sentencer
in
idaho,
doesn't
know
which
of
the
definitions
to
use,
if
any,
or
all.
and
so
the
problem
is
that
you
may
have
one
trial
judge
applying
the
super
premeditation
factor,
the
parties
present
their
evidence
and
the
trial
court
either
finds
utter
disregard
or
finds
no
utter
disregard
based
on
super
premeditation.
you
may
have
a
trial
judge
in
the
next
court
room
that's
applying
without
emotion.
and
so
the
problem
isn't
that
any
of
these
aren't
valid
or
that
all
of
them
aren't
valid,
but
we
don't
know
which
ones
are
being
used
in
which
court
rooms.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
let
me
back
up
a
step
and
say
the
first
point
is
that
i
wouldn't
concede
that
the
definitions
i
have
just
given
you
are
necessarily
independently
valid,
but
let's
assume
for
a
minute
that
they
are.
i
think
the
problem
is
that
it
still
leads
to
the
type
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
sentencing.
you
could
have
a
case...
and
this
court
has
two
cases
before
it
right
now.
one
is
arave
v.
paradis
which
came
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
this
where
the
trial
court
in
fact
appears
to
have
applied
the
super
premeditation
factor,
finding
that
there
was
no
emotion.
you
have
this
case
where
the
trial
court
says
i
find
utter
disregard
because
there
is
emotion.
it's
something
like
a
catch-22.
the
judge
knows
it
when
he
sees
it,
the
parties
really
have
no
knowledge
of
which
theory
the
trial
court
is
going
to
be
relying
on.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
that's
right.
and
if
the
idaho
supreme
court
were
to
pick
either
one
of
these,
or
in
fact
even
to
say
that
all
three
of
these
were,
to
articulate
a
limiting
definition
that
said
all
three
of
these,
any
one
of
which
may
be
found,
that
might
be
sufficient.
i
use
these
three
examples
as
illustrative
of
the
problem.
they
are
not
necessarily
all-inclusive
of
all
the
possibilities
of
cold-blooded.
they
are
simply
those
possibilities
that
are
apparent
on
the
record.
one
i
didn't
mention
was
the
webster's
definition
that
has
been
provided
to
us
by
the
attorney
general
which,
contrary
to
judge
trott's
view
that
cold-blooded
meant
without
any
emotion,
webster
says
without
warm
emotion.
i
mean,
there
are
as
many
definitions
probably
as
there
are
dictionaries.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
necessarily
we
communicate
in
words
and
there
is
an
inherent
imprecision
in
all
words,
as
your
honor
suggests.
i
guess
the
principle
here
is
that
when
there
are
so
many
different
definitions
and
we
don't
know
which
one
any
trial
court
is
using
and
we
have
no
notice,
we
have
no
statement
that
any
or
all
of
them
are
proper,
then
that
leads
to
the
type
of
arbitrary
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
mr.
clifford
gardner
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
think
it's
entirely
consistent
with
the
notion
i
am
presenting
of
it's
not
merely
that
we
have
a
subjective
term,
what
we
have
is
an
umbrella
term
that
has
these
varying
definitions--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--showing
an
indifference
to
the
suffering
of
the
victim,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
oh,
i
think
so.
mr.
clifford
gardner
evidences...
as
i
recall
the
limitation
it
was
evidencing
the
murder,
evidencing
a
sense
of
debasement
or
perversion.
mr.
clifford
gardner
and
i
think
the
reason
that
the
cases
are
distinguishable
gets
back
to
really
the
practical
side
of
the
problem
which
is
when
you
go
into
court
in
arizona
and
the
parties
are
looking
at
the
arizona
limiting
definition,
the
parties
are
going
to
see,
okay,
what
i
have
to
prove,
what
i
have
to
defend
against,
or
the
trial
judge
will
say
what
he
or
she
has
to
find,
is
not
simply
depraved,
which
i
think
is
analogous
to
cold-blooded,
but
i
have
to
find
relishing
the
murder,
evidencing
debasement
or
perversion.
i
have
to
find
that
there
was
an
indifference,
a
shown
indifference
to
the
murder.
the
parties,
if
i
can
use
somewhat
of
a
loose
expression,
they
know
what
they're
about.
in
idaho
the
parties
have
to
come
in
and
they
have
to
say
okay,
i
have
to
show
he's
cold-blooded
or
not
cold-blooded.
that's
an
abstraction.
it
means
other
things.
and
what
you're
proving
will
depend
on
what
those
other
things
mean,
and
it
can
mean
so
many
other
things.
that's
the
difference
between
walton
on
the
one
hand
and
osborn
on
the
other,
the
difference
between
an
abstraction,
which
is
osborn,
cold-blooded,
and
something
that
is
i
think
quite
real.
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
factual
findings
that
were
made
in
this
case.
there
were
several
questions
on
it
earlier.
as
your
honor
has,
i
think
justice
souter,
you
noted
some
of
the
factual
findings.
defendant
did
not
instigate
the
fight.
that
was
a
factual
finding.
the
victim
engaged
in
an
unprovoked
attack.
the
defendant
was
justified
in
defending
himself,
and
significantly,
once
commenced
the
killing
appears
to
be
intentional.
those
were
the
factual
findings,
of
course
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
was
an
excessive
violent
rage.
i
think
if
you
look
at
those
factual
findings
i
think
you
see
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
very
correct
in
holding
that
if
the
cold-blooded
means
without
emotion
it
could
not
have
been
applied
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
look
at
the
trial
court's
findings
in
this
case
and
think
that
in
fact
the
trial
court
was
operating
under
some
impression
that
it
was
without
emotion,
was
the
touchstone.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
the
idaho
supreme--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--the
idaho
supreme
court
could
make
a
de
novo
review.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
idaho
supreme
court
opinion
you
find
a
similar
tension
because
they
find
in
the
same
sentence
both
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
mitigating
circumstances
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
and
that's
really
the
only
statement
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
makes
as
to
these
findings
that
your
honor
has
suggested
are
inconsistent.
the
only
additional
insight
we
can
gain
from
the
idaho
supreme
court's
opinion
is
their
observation
that
in
fact
the
trial
court
did
not
find
that
this
was
committed
by
plan
by
mr.
creech.
so
although
they
may
have
been
free
to,
they
did
not.
i
think
that
much
we
can
glean
from
the
actual
opinion.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--it
does
go
beyond
the
actual
language
of
the
osborn
formulation
and
talks
about
the
application
to
this
case.
then
if
there
are
no
other
questions
on
the
actual
application
of
the
utter
disregard
factor
i
would
be
prepared
to
submit
it.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
solely
looking
at
lewis
my
answer
would
be
yes,
your
honor.
lewis
of
course
suggested
that
once
a
limiting
definition
is
proposed
by
the
state
and
if
it's
a
valid
limiting
definition
you
can't
look
at
actually
how
it's
applied.
that
simply
falls
under
the
third
part,
the
jackson
v.
virginia,
whether
a
rational
fact
finder
could
reach
the
result.
i
think,
however,
there
is
a
tension
between
that
aspect
of
lewis
and
sochor
v.
florida.
in
sochor
v.
florida
this
court
recognized
that
in
a
judge
sentencing
state
if
the
limiting
definition
is
not
quite
up
to
snuff
you
can
in
fact
look
at
applications.
that
was
a
case
out
of
florida
where
the
limiting
definition
that
this
court
had
approved
had
not
been
in
fact
used
by
florida
and
this
court
looked
at
how
it
was
applied.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
under
sochor
v.
florida
it
is,
and
certainly
in
a
judge
sentencing
case
it
should
be.
trial
courts
are
presumed
to
be
aware
not
only
of
the
articulated
principles
that
come
down
in
cases,
but
i
assume
of
the
applications
in
those
very
cases.
so
i
think
it
makes
sense
that
in
a
judge
sentencing
case,
as
idaho
is,
that
the
cases
applying
the
limiting
definition
should
be
considered.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
two
separate
questions--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
think
that
you
cannot
construct
one
in
this
case
because
in
fact
the
limiting
definition
is
not
constitutionally
proper.
i
think
were
it
constitutionally
proper,
perhaps
you
could
construct,
as
in
sochor
the
court
was
able
to
construct
a
reasonable
interpretation.
the
reason,
the
more
i
suppose
theoretical
reason
why
i
think
it's
proper
in
a
judge
sentencing
case
or
a
judge
sentencing
state
to
look
at
the
applications
is
because
the

to
me
some
intrinsic
sense
to
look
at
those
applications
to
see
what
a

judge
sitting
in
the
day-to-day
rigors
of
his
practice,
or
of
judging,
is
going
to
be
aware
