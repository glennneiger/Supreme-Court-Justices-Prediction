justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
trier
of
fact
in
assessing
this
particular
standard,
the
utter
disregard
for
human
life
with
the
osborn
gloss
on
it,
did
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
he
had
killed
previously.
am
i
correct
about
that
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
did
that
bear
on
the
fact
that
he
was
cold-blooded
and
pitiless?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
had
thought
that
the
statute
focused
on,
and
this
particular
part
of
the
statute,
the
pitiless
killer,
really
focused
more
on
the
killer's
conduct
with
respect
to
the
slaying
in
question,
in
which
case
the
previous
killings
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
statutory
aggravating
factors
other
than
utter
disregard
that
could
be
the
basis
for
imposing
the
death
sentence
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
lewis
v.
jeffers
prohibit
us
from
looking
at
the
way
in
which
idaho
has
applied
the
particular
definition
in
order
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
definition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
we're
passing
upon
the
limiting
definition
in
the
first
instance
is
it
then
appropriate
to
see
the
manner
in
which
the
court,
the
courts
of
the
state
have
applied
the
definition
over
a
number
of
cases?
