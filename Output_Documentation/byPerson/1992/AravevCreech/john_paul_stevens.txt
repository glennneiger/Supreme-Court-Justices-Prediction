justice
john
paul
stevens
general
thomas,
before
you
get
into
your
argument
can
i
just
get
one
thing
clear?
do
you
agree
that
unless
the
statutory
language
had
been
construed
by
the
idaho
supreme
court
that
it
would
be
unconstitutionally
vague,
or
do
you
defend
the
statute
on
its
face
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
description
seems
to
describe
this
case,
because
isn't
this
the
one
in
which
the
victim
provoked
the
fight?
the
trial
court
i
thought
found
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
this
question.
if
we
took
the
trial
court
at
face
value
would
it
still
satisfy
your
view
of
the
utter
disregard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
your
code...
all
the
aggravating
circumstances
aren't
quoted
in
the
brief
here,
but
is
the
fact
that
you
killed
people
in
the
past
a
separate
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
would
have
been
relevant
for
that.
