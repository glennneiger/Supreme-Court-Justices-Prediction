why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
by
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
thomas
creech
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
first
degree
murder
for
the
1981
beating
death
of
a
fellow
prison
inmate.
the
state
trial
court
sentenced
respondent
to
death.
based
in
part
on
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
that
by
the
murder
or
circumstances
surrounding
its
commission,
the
defendant
exhibited
utter
disregard
for
human
life.
the
idaho
supreme
court
rejected
the
respondent's
argument
that
the
utter
disregard
circumstance
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
reaffirm
the
limiting
construction
it
previously
had
announced
in
the
state
case
of
state
against
osborn.
that
limiting
construction
provides
in
part
that
the
phrase
"utter
disregard"
refers
to
acts
of
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime
which
exhibit
the
highest,
the
utmost
callous
disregard
for
human
life,
that
is
the
cold-blooded
pitiless
slayer.
respondent
filed
that
federal
habeas
petition.
the
district
court
denied
relief
but
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
respondent
that
the
utter
disregard
circumstance
as
narrowed
by
the
state's
osborn
case
is
invalid.
for
reasons
explained
in
an
opinion
dfile
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
osborn
construction
adequately
channels
the
sentencers
discretion
with
clear
and
objective
standards.
the
phrase
"cold-blooded
pitiless
slayer"
in
its
everyday
meaning
describes
a
person
who
kills
without
feeling
or
sympathy.
it
describes
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
which
is
a
fact
that
can
be
inferred
from
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
osborn
construction
also
genuinely
narrows
the
class
of
defendants
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
because
the
class
of
murders
eligible
to
receive
capital
punishment
in
idaho
is
large
and
a
sentencer
reasonably
could
find
that
not
all
are
cold-blooded.
we
do
not
reach
respondent's
alternative
argument
that
the
utter
disregard
circumstance
although
constitutional,
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied
to
him,
because
under
another
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
not
before
us
today,
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
