chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1160,
a.j.
arave
v.
thomas
e.
creech.
mr.
thomas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
any
effort
to
see
if
it
could
be
applied
to
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thomas.
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
mr.
gardner,
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that,
the
judicial
gloss
placed
on
the
idaho
statute
by
the
idaho
supreme
court
was
constitutional
as
applied
to
this
particular
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
made
two
separate
holdings
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
particulars
of
this
particular
defendant,
the
evidence
against
this
particular
defendant
are
not
really
before
us?
your
submission--
--let
him
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there's
going
to
be
a
resentencing
here
in
any
event,
at
least
the
most
important
element
that
we
could
decide,
i
suppose,
is
whether
or
not
the
judicial
gloss,
et
cetera,
is
or
is
not
constitutional
on
its
face.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
you're
not
entitled
to
know
that.
if
all
of
them
are
valid,
which
is
one
hypothesis
you
advance,
then
the
fact
that
one
judge
may
say
well,
this
is
a
case
involving
super
premeditation
and
then
the
judge
in
the
next
court
says
well,
this
particular
capital
case
involves
cold-blooded,
there's
no
fatal
flaw
about
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you,
but
you
have
to
say
then
that
one
of
the,
one
of
those
factors
is,
one
of
those
approaches
is
invalid
as
a
limiting
construction,
not
that
they're
different
from
one
another.
because
you
could
have
two
limiting
constructions
both
of
which
were
different
and
both
of
which
were
valid,
i
think,
by
hypothesis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
that
is
a
failing
you
can
find
with
almost
any
definition.
you
can
find
different
meanings
in
the
dictionary
for
words.
you're
never
going
to
get
away
from
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gardner.
mr.
thomas,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thomas.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1160,
arave
against
creech
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
