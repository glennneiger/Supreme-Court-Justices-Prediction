justice

white
at
the
outset
is
it,
is
the
vagueness
issue
the
only
question
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
didn't
limit
the
grant
of
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
is
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you're
going
to
argue.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
this
aggravating
factor,
as
described
or
narrowed
by
the
idaho
supreme
court,
could
be
applied
in
any
case,
or
is
the
claim
that
it
could
not
be
applied
to
any
case?
is
it
so
vague
that
it
just
couldn't
be
applied
to
any,
it
could
not
be
used
as
an
aggravating
factor
in
any
case
no
matter
what
the
facts
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
and
so
the
conclusion
was
it
couldn't
be
used
as
an
aggravating
factor
in
any
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
so
vague,
it
was
so
vague
that
there
is
no
case
that
it
could
be
applied
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
did
we
limit
the
grant
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
the
vagueness.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
the
first
holding
that
you
described.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
second
holding
that
you
described.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
issue
we
limited
our
grant
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
walton
decision
in
upholding
that
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
umbrella
term
in
walton
was,
one
of
them
was
especially
depraved,
and
i
thought
we
held
that
that
was
given
a
meaningful
construction
if
the
killer
showed
an
indifference
to
the
suffering
of
the
victim.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would,
you
would
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
evidences
a
sense
of
pleasure.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
you
looked
at
a
series
of
these
cases
you
think
you
could
construct
out
of
the,
out
of
the
way
this
factor
was
applied
a,
some
limiting
construction
that
would
be
satisfactory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
are
the
application
facts
relevant?
