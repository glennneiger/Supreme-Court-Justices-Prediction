all
right,
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
thomas,
could
i
come
back
to
the
factual
findings
again?
am
i
correct
that
the
trial
court
found
both
that
the
defendant
had
evidenced
an
excessive
violent
rage
and
also
that
he
had
used
the
attack
as
an
excuse
for
an
assassination?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
one
and
the
same,
same
time
found
both
of
those
things?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
authority
of
the
supreme
court
when
confronted
with
those
what
i
consider
utterly
incompatible
findings?
could
it
make
up
its
own
mind
on
the
basis
of
the
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
some
evidence
that
although
the
victim
was
the
attacker,
the
attack
had
been
in
effect
invited
by
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
provided
the
attacker
with
the
means
of
the
attack,
and
so
forth,
intending
to
use
that
as
an
excuse.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
presumably
that's
the
finding
that
the
supreme
court
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
the
relevance
of
the
past,
the
past
activities
was
simply
to
prove
the
fact
that
he
was
using
this
as
an
excuse
because
he
has
used
things
as
an
excuse
in
the
past.
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't
make
it
any
worse,
but
it
goes
to
prove
the
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
he
has
done
this
before
makes
it
more
likely
that
he,
that
that
indeed
was
what
he
was
up
to
this
time.
i
assume
it's
relevant
for
that
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it's
okay
if
it
refers
to
several
different
concepts,
so
long
as
they
are
a
limited
number
of
concepts.
is
there
anything
that
says
the
limiting,
each
limiting
factor
must
be
limited
to
one
single
thing?
i
mean,
so
long
as
it
separates
the,
from
the
generality
of
murderer
the
murderer
in
the
particular
case,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it
embraces
more
than
one
single
characteristic?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
idaho
supreme
court
have
to
accept
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
or
could
it
reexamine
the
whole
thing
de
novo?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
don't
know
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
was
accepting...
i
find
it
impossible
to
see
how
you
could
accept
both
the
finding
that
the
defendant
used
it
as
an
intentional
excuse
to
assassinate
and
the
finding
that
he
was
in
an
excessive
violent
rage.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
those
two
are
quite
incompatible
to
me,
so
i
assume
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
selected
one
or
the
other.
it
was
free
to
select
one
or
the
other,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
this
is
getting
us
into
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
rather
than
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert,
which
was
whether
the,
whether
the
aggravating
factor
in
itself
is
a
permissible
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regardless
of
how
it
was
applied
here.
