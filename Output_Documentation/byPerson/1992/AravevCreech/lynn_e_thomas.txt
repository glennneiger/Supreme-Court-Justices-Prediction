mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
petition
by
the
warden
of
the
idaho
maximum
security
institution
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
idaho
has
in
its
statutory
death
sentencing
scheme
a
provision
that
the
death
penalty
is
authorized
if
it
is
proven
by
the
state
that
the
murder
was
committed
with
utter
disregard
for
human
life.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
this
provision
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
that
the
limiting
construction
imposed
on
it
by
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
is
likewise
deficient.
that
construction,
the
idaho
supreme
court's
construction,
is
to
the
effect
that
the
utter
disregard
factor
is
to
be
limited
by
inquiring
into
whether
the
killing
was
committed
with
utmost
callous
disregard
for
human
life,
that
is
to
say
whether
the
killer
was
a
cold-blooded,
pitiless
slayer.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
vagueness
issue
is
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
there
is
also
a
question
about
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
reviewed
or
correctly
deferred.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
the
certiorari
grant
was
limited
to
the
vagueness
question,
the
utter
disregard
question.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
it
is...
yes,
it
is.
it's
the
only
issue
with
respect
to--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--that's
correct.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
the
utter
disregard
or
cold-bloodedness
finding
in
this
case
is
supported
by
a
considerable
background
of
murderous
behavior
by
the
defendant,
and
by
the
fact
that
in
this
case
he
killed
another
inmate
in
the
state
maximum
security
institution.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
necessarily
concede
that
it
would
be
facially
vague,
but
we
did,
when
this
case
went
to
the
idaho
supreme
court
for
the
first
time,
suggest
that
the
court
impose
on
it
a
limiting
construction
as
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
factor
was
to
be
applied
in
the
narrowest
kinds
of
circumstances.
but
i
would
not
make
the
concession
that
there
is
an
actual
facial
vagueness
problem
with
it
because
we
believe
that
the
term
utter
disregard
for
human
life
has
the
kind
of
content
that
makes
it
possible
to
distinguish
this
kind
of
case
from
a
larger
universe
of
lesser
murders.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
no,
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
the
precise
language
is
not
duplicated
in
any
of
the
other
statutes
and
it,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
was
not
a
model
penal
code
suggestion.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that
i
believe
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
he
did
find
also
that
there
was
a
propensity
to
commit
murder.
he
had
referred
to
the
numerous
past
killings
that
the
defendant
had
committed
and--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--i
think
it
did.
it's
not
entirely
clear
from
the
trial
court's
language,
which
was
not
extensive
and
not
very
precise.
but
i
think
when
you
take
into
account
all
of
the
things
that
the
court
said
in
its
findings,
that
it's
talking
about
a
conclusion
that
this
was
a
particularly
cold-blooded
killer
and
that
had
something
to
do
with
all
of
the
other
murders,
with
the
pattern
of
murderous
behavior
that
he
had
exhibited
in
the
past.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
i
think
the
statute
focuses
on
anything
that
reflects
a
cold-blooded
or
particularly
callous
state
of
mind,
and
that
can
refer
to
a
pattern
of
murderous
behavior.
the
fact
that
it
also
establishes
another
aggravating
circumstance
doesn't
necessarily
take
away
from
that
in
our
view.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
well,
i
think
that
almost
any
murder,
your
honor,
would
be,
would
qualify
as
not
cold-blooded
or
pitiless
if
there
were
any
kind
of
emotional
provocation
that
went
with
it,
any
kind
of
distress,
any
kind
of
justification
or
excuse
that
didn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
legal
defense.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
decided
and
the
cases
that
have
gone
before
the
trial
courts,
what
you
find
is
that
the
cold-blooded
factor
encompasses
a
very
small
number
of
cases.
it's
a
rather
rare
kind
of
circumstance.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
there
is
language
in
connection
with
the
court's
mitigation
considerations,
your
honor,
that
suggests
that
what
the
court
found
was
that
the
defendant
initially,
i'm
sorry,
the
victim
initially
provoked
the
attack.
and
what
the
evidence
in
the
case
reflects
is
a
little
different
than
that.
we
think
that
the
trial
court
misspoke
or
used
some
ambiguous
language
taken
in
the
full
context
of
its
findings
because
the
evidence
is
pretty
clear--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--i
believe
it
would,
your
honor,
although
i
would
acknowledge
that
there
are
ambiguities
in
the
trial
court's
description
of
the
case
and
it
is
not
as
complete
as
we
would
have
liked
to
see
it.
that
of
course
is
not
the
end
of
the
line
in
our
judicial
sentencing
system
because
the
state
supreme
court
conducts
a
full
course
of
independent
review
of
all
death
sentences.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
yes,
your
honor.
the
trial
judge's
finding,
or
at
least
his
statement
that
the
murder
was
committed
in
an
excessive
violent
rage
and
that
the
victim
initially
provoked
the
attack
is
very
troublesome
because
it's
not
entirely
consistent
with
the
evidence.
the
evidence
really
was
that
creech
arranged
for
the
attack--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
yes,
it
is,
but
for
a
little
different
reason.
the
trial
judge's
findings
at
face
value
are
ambiguous
but
they
do
contain
findings
that
creech
had
indicated
he
intended
to
keep
on
killing
people,
that
he
was
remorseless
and
calculating,
language
essentially--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--well,
let
me
in
response
to
your
question,
if
i
may,
focus
on
one
aspect
of
what
does
appear
in
the
trial
court's
finding,
and
that
is
that
after
the
victim
was
helpless
and
after
he
had
been
completely
dominated
by
creech,
creech
killed
him
at
that
point.
now,
what
the
trial
judge
focused
on,
among
other
things
i
think,
was
the
nature
of
the
particularly
indifferent
or
cold-blooded
action
of
the
defendant
in
stomping
this
individual
to
death
after
he
was
down
on
the
floor--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
accurately
characterizes
what
the
trial
judge
found
here.
he
said
that
there
was
an
excessive
violent
rage,
but
he
seems
to
have
been
describing
the
nature
of
the
killing
and
not
the
original
motivation
of
the
defendant
for
setting
things
up
in
this
fashion.
i
think
that
is
the
key
factor
here
when
you
look
at
the
cold-bloodedness
of
the
defendant's
behavior,
and
that
is
something
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
entirely
explain.
but
that
ambiguity
i
think
is
resolved
when
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
course
of
its
independent
review
function
says
that
it
has
never
seen
in
50
years
of
examining
comparable
cases
a
more
remorseless,
cold-blooded
or
calculating
killer
than
this
individual.
so
i
think
that
ambiguity,
if
that's
what
it
is
in
the
trial
court's
finding,
is
cured
by
that--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
he
had
at
some
time
prior
to
his
imprisonment
shot
himself
in
the
head
with
a
38
caliber
revolver.
a
portion
of
his
brain
had
been
damaged.
he
had
some
plastic,
cranial
plastic
material
over
the
top
of
the
injured
area.
he
was
partially
paralyzed,
slow
and
uncoordinated,
and,
as
creech
indicated
in
his
confession,
the
law
enforcement
officers
wasn't
able
to
handle
himself
and
creech
was
quite
well
aware
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
put
up
much
of
a
response.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
thin
that
is
one
of
the
really
important
factors
that
indicates
the
cold-bloodedness
or
the
focus
on
cold-bloodedness
that
the
trial
court
engaged
in
in
its
consideration
of
the
case.
when
you
talk
about
an
assassination,
when
you
talk
about
the
victim's
attack
as
an
excuse
for
what
happened
later,
i
think
what
you
see
is
that
the
trial
court
is
really
considering
this
the
kind
of
utmost
callous
or
cold-blooded
behavior
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
encompass.
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
accurately
or
fully
apply
this
court's
precedent
in
walton
v.
arizona
which
has
two
important
components.
one
of
them
is
that
a
judicial
sentencing
system
such
as
we
have
is
entitled
to
some
more
deference
than
other
kinds
of
sentencing
systems,
and
that
the
godfrey-maynard
rationale
does
not
fully
apply
in
those
circumstances.
if
you
assume
that
the
trial
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
knew
the
law
in
this
case,
knew
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
and
applied
it,
you
have
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
in
this
process
idaho's
courts
applied
the
narrowest
possible
construction
of
the
utter
disregard
factor
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
rather
than
the
broadest
possible
factor.
in
walton
and
in
some
of
the
other
cases
involving
the
analogous
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
or
cruel
factor
the
courts
were
trying
to
define
a
word
like
heinousness,
which
is
much
broader
and
less
specific
and
much
more
difficult
to
deal
with
in
a
sentencing
situation
than
the
term
cold-blooded.
cold-blooded
talks
about
a
state
of
mind,
and
there
are
lots
of
circumstances
in
which
courts
have
to
deal
with
state
of
mind
descriptions.
there
are
circumstances
such
as
arise
when
it's
necessary
to
determine
what
is
premeditated
and
what
does
it
mean,
or
what
is
malice
of
forethought
and
what
does
it
mean,
what
is
reckless
disregard
and
what
does
it
mean.
so
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
calling
on
the
sentencing
authority
to
apply
a
moral
judgment
in
making
the
determination
that
an
actor
in
a
criminal
case--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--yes,
i
believe
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
with
this
proviso,
they
said
that
the
factor
itself
was
not
invalid,
it
was
just
that
the
idaho
supreme
court's
limiting
construction
hadn't
provided
any
more
guidance
than
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
yes,
as
limited,
that's
correct.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
they
appeared
not
to
have
done
so
or
not
to
have
done
so
in
a
very
significant
fashion,
your
honor,
because
the
court
simply
said,
like
the
heinousness
factor
in
godfrey
and
maynard
or
similar
factors,
the
limiting
instruction
doesn't
mean
anything
different
than
the
statute,
and
they
did
not
appear
to
make
any--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--that's
the
way
i
read
the
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
we
did
take
the
position,
as
i
recall,
and
i'm
not,
i
don't
recall
specifically
how
we
set
this
up.
we
took
the
position
in
a
supplemental
brief.
walton
of
course
was
decided
after
this
case
was
argued.
we
took
the
position
in
a
supplemental
brief
that
our
judicial
sentencing
system
did
make
a
difference.
what
the
eighth
amendment
requires
us
to
do
is
to
construct
a
sentencing
system
that
is
capable
of
setting
aside
in
a
principled
and
guided
way
those
murderers
which
should
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
or
should
have
the
death
penalty
from
all
the
others.
walton
tells
us
that
we
need
to
provide
some
guidance.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
have
done
that.
with
the
utter
disregard
factor
as
it
has
been
limited
in
particular
we
have
provided
some
guidance.
it
is
not
mathematically
precise
guidance
because
the
courts
have
to
use
words,
but
this
process
is
simply
one
of
predicting
how
words
will
be
understood
by
other
people,
and
in
particular
by
courts.
i
think
there
is
considerable
predictive
value
in
the
cold-bloodedness
language,
the
utmost
disregard
language
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
used.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that's
a
valid
point,
your
honor.
you
could
say
that
all
murders
are
pitiless
and
cold-blooded.
however,
this
factor
is--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--i'm
sorry,
all
first...
you
may
even
say
that
about
all
murders,
second
degree
murders
at
least.
however,
going
back
once
again
to
the
assumption
that
courts
and
judicial
sentencers
know
and
apply
the
law,
and
know
and
apply
this
court's
precedents
interpreting
the
constitution,
one
must
i
think
reach
the
conclusion
that
all
of
the
courts
in
this
process
know
that
they
must
apply
the
narrowest
possible
construction
to
the
aggravating
factor
and
did
so,
and
therefore
that
sets
what
might
be
called,
i
suppose,
ordinary
murders
apart
in
the
way
this
factor
is
used,
and
i
think
that's
all
we're
required
to
do
under
the
constitution.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that's
exactly--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--yes.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
it
could
indeed.
it
has
said,
and
said
in
the
osborn
case
that
its
duty
was
to
perform
a
fully
independent
review,
and
that
that
review
was
to
consider
factual
support,
the
evidentiary
support
for
the
sentence,
whether
it
was
excessive,
and
whether
it
was
just--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--yes.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that's
our
view.
i
might
mention
also
that
in
the
record
that
was
before
the
sentencing
court
and
before
the
supreme
court
is
a
record
of
other
cases
in
which,
at
least
one
other
case
in
which
creech
was
prosecuted,
and
it
reflects
an
almost
consistent
behavior
on
his
part
of
trying
to
create
self-defense
or
defense
of
others
appearances.
in
a
case
in
idaho
in
which
creech
was
prosecuted
in
1975
he
killed
two
people
in
an
automobile
who
had
picked
him
and
his
girlfriend
up
while
they
were
hitchhiking
on
the
highway.
he
suggested
to
his
girlfriend
after
he
had
killed
them
for
no
reason
at
all
that
the
reason
was
to
be
a
defense
of
her
or
defense
of
himself
justification.
in
another
case
in
oregon
where
he
murdered
a
young
man
in
a
church
he
threatened
a
witness
and
told
him
that
he
would
kill
him
if
he
didn't
support
his
self-defense
theory.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
well,
i
think
the
principal
relevant
factor
from
the
other
crimes
is
that
creech,
just
as
he
did--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--i
see
your
point,
your
honor,
and
i
think
we
are
reading
it
the
same
way,
but
i
don't--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--well,
irrespective
of
the
nature
of
the
aggravating
factor
itself,
the
court
is
obliged
to
consider
all
of
the
aspects
that
are
there
about
the
defendant's
character
and
his
background
and
his
criminal
behavior.
but--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--that's
true
enough.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
but
even
with
respect
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
crime.
if
one
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
commission
of
the
crime
is
that
creech
is
carrying
out,
consistently
with
his
past
behavior,
simply
his
usual
motivation
that
he
likes
to
kill
people,
that
is
directly
relevant
to
some
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
it
is
directly
relevant
to
the
question
of
cold-bloodedness.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
what--
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
--it
certainly
is,
and
that
is
a,
that's
a
different
factor.
that
is
a
propensity
to
commit
murder
factor
which
the
court
also
found.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
the
sentencing
hearing
was,
involved
no
additional
production
of
witnesses.
it
involved
the
reference
back
to
the
preliminary
hearing
transcript
and
to
other
information
that
was
before
the
court.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
he
pleaded
guilty.
so
the
argument
wasn't
specifically
made,
i
don't
think,
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
that
time
as
to
how
it
should
be
considered.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lynn
e.
thomas
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
conclude
our
argument.
