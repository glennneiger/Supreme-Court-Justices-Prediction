ms.
dola
j.
young
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
thomas
lee
deal,
the
petitioner,
committed
six
bank
robberies
in
the
houston,
texas
area
during
a
4-month
period.
in
addition
to
being
found
guilty
and
sentenced
for
those
bank
robberies
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
for
six
counts
of
using
a
firearm
during
a
crime
of
violence
and
for
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
weapon.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
mr.
deal
was
given
notice
that
he
would
receive
20-year
sentences
on
five
of
the
six
counts
for
using
a
firearm
during
a
crime
of
violence
pursuant
to
18
u.s.c.
924(c).
mr.
deal
contends
that
his
fifth
amendment
due
process
rights
were
violated
because
the
rule
of
lenity
was
not
applied
when
imposing
the
20-year
sentences
under
section
924(c).
ms.
dola
j.
young
no,
your
honor,
it
is
required
by
the
rulings
of
this
court
when
a
statute
is
ambiguous.
so
for
that
reason
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
construe
the
statute
as
imposing
a
20-year
sentence
only
if
the
offense
is
committed
after
a
previous
5-year
sentence
has
been,
has
become
final.
such
a
construction
is
necessary
because
the
language
of
section
924(c),
specifically
in
the
case
of
his
second
or
subsequent
conviction,
is
ambiguous
for
several
reasons
when
both
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
structure
and
operation
of
the
statute
are
considered.
turning
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
specific
language
at
issue
has
two
meanings,
one
of
two
meanings.
it
can
be
construed
as
multiple
convictions
occurring
at
the
same
time,
or
it
can
be
construed
as
multiple
convictions
occurring
in
chronological
sequence.
also--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--of
105,
yes,
sir.
ms.
dola
j.
young
well,
30
years
on
the
924(c)
counts,
plus
he
received
approximately
14
years
on
the
bank
robberies
which
was
to
run
concurrently
with
10
years
for
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
weapon.
so
the
total
sentence
would
be
approximately
44
years.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir,
that
was
the
crime
of
violence.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir,
they
were.
there
were
six
bank
robberies,
there
were
four
different
banks,
and
two
of
the
banks
were
robbed
twice
but
at
different
dates,
on
different
dates.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
still
be
here
because
looking
at
the
operation
of
the
statute,
the
statute
is
in
two
parts.
the
first
part,
which
calls
for
a
5-year
sentence
when
a
firearm
is
used
during
a
crime
of
violence,
is
clearly
an
enhancement
statute.
that
is
the
penalty
is
imposed
for
violation
of
another
statutory
provision.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir.
ms.
dola
j.
young
no,
your
honor,
because
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
in
the
case
of
his
second
or
subsequent
conviction,
is
a
recidivist
statute,
and
that
language,
in
the
case
of,
is
linking
the
second
part
of
the
statute
to
the
first,
and
it's--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--when
the
offense
occurs
after
a
previous
sentence
has
become
final.
ms.
dola
j.
young
the
offense
would
have
to
occur
after
the
previous
5-year
sentence
had
become
final.
the
hypothetical--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--yes.
and
that's
because
of
the
language
in
the
case
of,
because
it's
referring
back
to
that
part
in
the
first
clause,
that
use
of
a
firearm
and
receiving
a
5-year
sentence.
ms.
dola
j.
young
well--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--well,
i
think
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
general
policy
of
recidivist
statutes,
and
that
is
for--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--the
position
is
that
the
offense
would
have
to
have
become
final,
the
offense
would
have
to
occur
after.
and
you
are
correct,
because
your
hypothetical
said
that
if
he
had
been
sentenced,
he
was
in
prison
and
he
escaped.
then
yes,
you
are
correct,
then
for
the
bank
robbery
that
occurred
after
the
escape
the
20
years
would
apply.
ms.
dola
j.
young
well,
we
don't
know
that
congress
intended
this
to
be
a
habitual--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--well,
given
that
situation
we
don't
know
which
of
the
counts
would
be
the
second
conviction.
there
is
no
notice
of
where
the
second
conviction
occurs.
ms.
dola
j.
young
it
could
mean
second
in
order
or
it
could
mean
subsequent,
take
the
meaning
of
subsequent,
which
would
refer
to
later
in
time.
but
he
had...
the
problem
is
that
mr.
deal,
a
person
in
mr.
deal's
position
would
not
have
any
notice
of
when
that
enhancement
would
apply,
the
20-year
sentence
would
apply.
the
respondent
i
think
concedes
the
ambiguity
of
this
language
by
rewriting
the
statute
in
a
manner
that
changes
the
language.
respondent's
construction
of
this
statute,
which
as
i
said
is
a
rewrite,
is
that
there
would
be
20
years
for
any
subsequent
offense,
and
that
does
not
give
effect
to
every
clause
and
word
of
the
statute.
if
we
look
at
the
operation
of
the
statute
because
the
language
itself
is
ambiguous,
i
would
also...
i
need
to
back
up
a
minute
to
the
language
of
conviction.
that
also
goes
to
the
ambiguity
of
the
language
because
conviction,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
previous
opinions,
that
the
word
conviction
carries
two
different
meanings
and
congress
has
attached
different
meanings
to
different
statutes.
and
there
is
no
definition
of
the
word
conviction
in
the
statute,
so
we
would
have
to
construe
conviction
as
meaning
a
final
judgment
and
not
simply
a
finding
of
guilt,
as
the
respondent
would
have
us
do.
now,
turning
to
the
structure
and
operation
of
the
statute,
although
the
language
is
unclear
we
can
glean
some
help
from
the
structure
in
support
of
petitioner's
construction.
the
first
part
is
the
sentence
enhancement,
that
is
it
imposes
an
increased
punishment
for
one
convicted
under
another
statutory
provision.
the
second
part
is
a
recidivist
statute
because
of
the
words
in
the
case
of,
which
clearly
refer
to
a
legal
proceeding
which
introduces
a
stiffer
penalty
for
one
who
has
ignored
a
previous
notice
by
way
of
a
conviction.
the--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--a
legal
proceeding.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
we
do,
but
as
this
court
has
noted,
when
a
term
has
more
than
one
meaning
and
there
is
a
meaning
that
is
applicable
in
a
legal
sense,
then
the
legal
sense
is
the
one
that
governs,
and
that
would
be
the
reason
for
construing
in
the
case
of
as
a
legal
proceeding.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that
case
comes,
that
comes
from
the
case...
i
don't
have
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
right
now,
but
there
is
a
case
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
for
that
proposition.
the
dependence--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--i
would--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--i
would
read
it
after
conviction--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--if
an
offense
after
conviction,
an
offense
that
is
sentenced
in
a
proceeding
after
conviction
would
receive
a
20-year
sentence.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
correct.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
exactly
the
point,
justice
scalia,
that
we
don't
get
it
from
the
language.
we
look
at
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
we
look
also
at
the
fact
that
there
are
different
sentences
imposed,
because
it
makes
no
sense
to
impose
5
years
and
20
years
at
the
same
time.
if
congress
had
wanted
something
like
that
to
apply,
congress
could
simply
have
said
20,
or
10
or
20
years
for
any
offense
where
a
firearm
is
used
during
a
crime
of
violence.
there
is
no
real
reason,
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
those
different
sentences
imposed
at
the
same
time.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that
is
one
possibility,
but
i
think,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
that
a
mere
possibility,
a
mere
construction
is
not
sufficient
to
provide
a
person
with
notice.
that
is
one
possible
reading
of
it,
but
again
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
notice
that
the
defendant,
when
he
knows
that
he
will
be
subject
to
the
20-year
sentence--
respondent
points--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--yes,
sir,
i
do.
and
that's
for
two
reasons.
ms.
dola
j.
young
not,
absolutely
not.
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
last
part
of
the
statute
refers
to
convicted.
the
court
shall
not
place
on
probation
or
suspend
the
sentence
of
any
person
convicted
of
a
violation
of
this
subsection.
so
therefore
we
would
have
to
refer
to
that
as
a
judgment.
a
finding
of
guilt
also
does
not,
a
finding
of
guilt
requires
some
indicia
of
finality,
and
just
a
simple
finding
of
guilt
does
not
require,
it
does
not
give
a
defendant
any,
it
does
not
give
the
sentence...
excuse
me.
a
simple
finding
of
guilt
does
not
provide
an
indicia
of
finality.
ms.
dola
j.
young
there
there
would
be
an
indicia
of
finality.
ms.
dola
j.
young
then
yes,
you're
correct,
then
it's
final
because
the
sentence
has
been
imposed.
but,
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
requirement
to
then
turn
around
and
do,
impose
a
20-year
sentence,
there
is
no
notice
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
to
support
that.
ms.
dola
j.
young
it
does
not.
ms.
dola
j.
young
i
don't
recall
which
justice
it
was,
but
asked
me
if
a
conviction
would
refer
to
a
finding
of
guilt,
and
that's
when
i
responded
that
a
conviction
would
not
refer
to
a
simple
finding
of
guilt.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes.
ms.
dola
j.
young
one
single
judgment.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
correct.
respondent--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--that
would
not
be
proper,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
solve--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
follow
your
question.
ms.
dola
j.
young
no,
because
then
that
still
does
not
take
care
of
the
notice
requirement
that
a
defendant
would
not
know
when
he
would
be
subject
to
that
20-year
sentence.
and
i
think,
as
respondent
has
pointed
to
21
u.s.c.
section
962(b)
as
an
example
of
what
congress
can
do
to
overcome
this
particular
problem,
and
that
is
an
example
of
what
congress
can
do,
but
that
statute
was
enacted
2
years
after
924(c),
and
924(c)
was
the
first
attempt
that
congress
made
to
resolve
this
issue.
and
congress
made
a
deliberate
choice
of
words
to
say
subsequent
conviction
and
not
subsequent
offense,
as
it
had
in
other
statutes
earlier,
and
i
think
this
is
because
congress
was
struggling
with
a
different
situation.
and
also
the
fact
must
be
noted
that
this
statute
was
passed
in
great
haste
when
compared
to
other
recidivist
statutes.
ms.
dola
j.
young
if
it
had
read
subsequent
offense,
i
don't
think
so,
because
that's
the
exact
structure
that
the
government
is
relying
on
in
order
to
get
this
105-year
sentence,
because
the
government
says
for
any
subsequent
offense
then
it's
20
years.
and
so
then
no,
it
would
not
help
my
position.
ms.
dola
j.
young
it
has
been
my
experience
one
judgment
covering
the
whole
case.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir.
another--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--no,
because
as
one
of
the
other
justices
pointed
out,
if
the
person
had
been
incarcerated
and
escaped
and
committed
an
offense,
then
the
20
years
would
be
applicable
in
that
situation.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
that
puts
you
on,
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
puts
you
on
notice
for
any
subsequent
offenses.
ms.
dola
j.
young
well,
correct.
well,
i
am
assuming
that
once
it's
imposed
you
begin
to
serve
it.
but--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--but
then
the
offense
has
not
occurred--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--another
aspect--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--you
could
not
suspend--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--that's...
i
did
not
say
it
would
require
the
serving
of
the
sentence.
i
thought
that
i
was
saying
that
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir,
i
did.
ms.
dola
j.
young
another
aspect
of
the
structural
ambiguity
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
was
almost
20
years
before
prosecutors
leaped
to
this
interpretation.
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1968
and
it
was
1987
before
we
saw
an
issue
of
this
type
come
before
the
courts.
prosecutors
across
the
country
conceded
to
two
or
three
consecutive
5-year
sentences
being
imposed
even
as
late
as
1991.
there
are
some
cases
cited
in
the
brief
to
that
effect.
the
split
in
the
circuits
also
attests
to
the
structural
ambiguity.
and
finally,
the
respondent
concedes
by
asking
this
court
to
construe
this
statute
in
a
manner
that
no
other
recidivist
statute
operate,
and
it
would
make
this
statute
very
different
from
any,
the
operation
of
any
other
statute
of
its
kind.
respondent's
construction
is
an
anomaly
for
five
reasons.
one,
it
changes
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
changes,
substitutes
offense
in
for
conviction,
and
substitutes
any
subsequent
for
second
or
subsequent.
two--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--that
we
would
also
win
if
it
said
second
or
subsequent
judgment,
because
there
was
only
one
judgment.
ms.
dola
j.
young
but
then
it
does
not
take
into
effect
the
relationship
to
the
first
part--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--that
is
true
in
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
dola
j.
young
no,
it
does
not,
and
that...
in
construing
the
statute
i
think
the
court
would
need
to
be,
we'd
need
to
look
at
that.
that
is
not
the
situation
that
mr.
deal
faced,
but
it
is,
it
sort
of
makes
it
irrelevant
that
we're
even
here
if
that
is
the
construction
that
the
court
gives
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
dola
j.
young
i
would
begin
by
taking
issue
with
mr.
estrada's
position
that
conviction
means
a
finding
of
guilt.
as
justice
o'connor
questioned
this
court's
opinion
in
the
dickerson
case,
dickerson
does
require
an
indicia
of
finality.
and
mr.
estrada
referred
specifically
to
page
111
as
support
for
his
position
that
it's
a
finding
of
guilt.
however,
on
that
page
the
court
also
noted
that
of
significance
was
that
the,
that
mr.
kenneson
was
placed
on
probation
even
though
sentence
had
not
been
imposed.
there
was
an
indication
of
finality
from
the
fact
that
he
was
placed
on
probation.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
sir.
and
there
was
not
just
simply
a
finding
of
guilt
in
that
case.
ms.
dola
j.
young
well,
that's
true.
there
was
not
any
finding
of
guilt
because
it
was
a
deferred
adjudication
type
case.
the
statute
is
ambiguous--
ms.
dola
j.
young
--it
does
not
require
that
sentence
has
to
be
actually
imposed,
you
are
correct,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
dola

however,
i
think
that
it
does
not
support
mr.
estrada's
position
that
simply
a
finding
of
guilt
is
sufficient
for
a
conviction.
the
dickerson
case,
i
might
also
note,
was
a
civil
case
and
not
really
a
criminal
case,
so
there
is
just
some
indication
of
support.
it's
not
exactly
on
point.
ms.
dola
j.
young
this
was
a
jury
trial,
and
the
jury
found
mr.
deal
guilty
on
each
count.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
correct.
yes.
ms.
dola
j.
young
that's
correct.
ms.
dola
j.
young
yes,
your
honor.
the
change,
mr.
estrada
referred
to
changes
in
the
statute,
and
there
have
been
several
amendments
to
the
statute
since
1968,
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
none
of
those
amendments
have
dealt
with
this
particular
language
and
there
has
been
no
further
elucidation
or
any
changes
to
this
specific
language.
due
process
is
required
from
the
law
and
the
indictment,
and
not
just
from
merely
splitting
the
indictments.
so
splitting
the
indictments
still
does
not
address
the
issue
of
the
due
process
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
the,
in
reference
to
dangerous
people,
18
u.s.c.
section
924(e),
which
is
also
a
part
of
the
gun
control
act,
is
similar
to
924(c)
in
that
they
are
both
designed
to
eliminate
the
use
of
firearms
and
get
them
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people.
924(e)
also
uses
the
word
conviction
and
does
not
define
conviction.
this...
thank
you
very
much.
