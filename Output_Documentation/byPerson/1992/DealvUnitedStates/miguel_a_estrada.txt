mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
deal
was
found
guilty
of
using
a
gun
in
six
different
bank
robberies
on
six
different
dates.
the
district
court
sentenced
him
to
20
years
on
each
count
on
which
he
was
found
guilty
of
using
a
gun,
save
for
the
first,
finding
that
each
of
those
counts
was
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
under
section
924(c).
eight
of
the
nine
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
that
issue
have
agreed
with
the
district
court--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--a
conviction
is
a
finding
of
guilt
by
a
court
or
jury,
justice
white.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
or
when
a
plea
of
guilty
is
entered.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
not
as
the
word
is
used
in
context
in
this
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
dickerson
the
court
was
dealing
with
section
922(g),
which
is
part
of
the
same
chapter
where
section
924(c)
is
now.
and
the
term
in
dickerson
was
that
someone
who
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
was
not
allowed
to
have
a
firearm.
the
word--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--with
all
respect,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
in
fact
not
what
the
court
said.
the
court
at
page
111,
if
i
recall,
said
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
the
entry
of
the
plea
and
more
was
not
required,
and
those
were
the
words
that
the
court
used.
as
it
happens--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
that
is
not
right,
justice
white,
for
the
following
reason.
the
statute
uses
the
word
conviction
under
this
subsection,
which
means
a
finding
of
guilt
under
this
subsection,
and
there
were
six
different
findings
of
guilt
by
the
jury
under
section
924(c).
each
of
them
was
a
conviction
under
the
statute.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
word
second
in
this--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
we
think
that
each
of
the
two
terms
has
a
distinct
meaning
in
the
statute,
justice
white.
the
word
second
in
everyday
language
means
the
number
two
in
a
countable
series
or
what
follows
the
first,
either
in
time
or
in
number
sequence.
the
word
subsequent
in
this
context
means
what
follows
the
second,
either
in
time
or
in
number
sequence,
and
it
is
just
a
proxy
for
congress
to
have
said
third,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
et
cetera.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
significant
point
is
that
they
made
seven
different
findings
of
guilt
under
section
924(c),
and
that
is
all
that
the
statutory
language
calls
for
in
this
case,
justice
white.
those
are,
five
of
those
are
second
or
subsequent
convictions
under
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
most
significant
and
salient
point
about
the
case
is
that
this
is
a
dangerous
person
statute.
it
is
not
in
anyway
a
recidivist
statute.
the
structure
of
the
language,
and
especially
the
scale
of
penalties
in
section
924(c)
make
that
very
clear.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
right,
justice
souter,
because
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute
makes
clear
that
what
congress
is
doing
in
the
statute
is
two
things.
it
is
looking
to
identify
persons
who
do
even
one
crime
with
especially
dangerous
weapons,
and
also
looking
to
identify
those
who
do
dangerous
or
even
more
dangerous
crimes
more
than
once.
even
a
first--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
not
necessarily
so
as
a
general
matter,
justice
souter.
that
is
not
so
in
this
statute.
under
this
statute
even
a
first
crime
carries
a
mandatory
penalty
of
30
years
imprisonment
if
the
firearm
used
is
equipped
with
a
silencer,
if
it
is
a
machine
gun,
or
under
the
most
recent
changes,
if
the
firearm
is
a
bomb
or
any
similar
explosive.
and
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
those
types
of
activities
are
so
dangerous
that
even
someone
who
does
that
only
once,
and
for
the
very
first
time
in
his
life,
should
be
subject
to
the
30-year
mandatory
sentence.
we
think
that
the
second
or
subsequent
clause
that
immediately
follows
is
written
in
the
same
vein,
and
simply
seeks
to
identify
a
particularly
dangerous
class
of
criminals,
those
who
would
use
a
gun
to
do
a
crime
more
than
once
and
who
thereby
place
at
risk
the
lives
of
other
people
every
time
they
do
so.
what
congress
in
effect
is
saying
to
those
persons
is
if
you
are
the
type
of
person
who
would
do
a
crime
with
a
gun
more
than
once
you
are
just
too
dangerous
to
have
around
and
you
must
be
separated
and
incapacitated
from
society.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
right
in
the
sense
that
the
issue
did
not
come
up
in
a
litigated
case
until
1987.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
the
issue
wouldn't
be
really--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
don't
know,
and
i
think
that
the
reason
it
did
not
come
up
is
because
until
the
mid
eighties
the
penalties
for
a
first
and/or
second
were
quite
close
to
one
another.
they
were
5
and
10.
and
in
fact
there
were--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
was
not...
the
first
court
of
appeals
case
dealing
with
the
issue
was
rawlings
coming
from
the
circuit
in
florida,
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
1987.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
19
years.
and
for
most
of
that
time,
justice
stevens--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
important
point
is
that
the
penalty
ranges
with
the
first
few
years
were
overlapping.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
there
were
two
different
issues,
justice
stevens.
for
part
of
the
time
the
statute
was
written
in
a
way
where
the
sentence
was
not
fixed.
there
were
two
ranges,
and
the
ranges
were
overlapping.
that
is
the
first
problem.
so
there
was
a
measure
of
discretion
in
the
district
court
to
give
a
slightly
different
sentence.
the
second
issue
is
that
even
when
congress
changed
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
they
did
that
in
the
early
eighties.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
scalia.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
following
that
the
range
was
5
under
the
first
clause
and
10
under
the
next,
so
it
was
not
the
type
of
issue
that
would
be
actively
litigated
because
even
though
it
obviously
mattered
it
didn't
matter
as
much
as
it
does
now.
it
was
not
until--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
think
that
he
is
more
likely
to
take
issue
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
if
more
turns
on
it
than
not.
i
think
that
is
right.
the
next
point
i
was
going
to
make
in
reference
to
what
counsel
said
is
that
it
is
not
the
case
that
there
were
other
cases
in
which
the
government
stipulated
to
a
lower
sentence
by
reason
of
any
view
it
had
of
the
second
or
subsequent
clause.
the
cases
it
cites,
one
from
the
tenth
circuit
and
one
from
the
ninth,
both
deal
with
a
different
problem
that
is
not
raised
in
this
case
and
which
is
logically
antecedent
to
the
problem
in
this
case,
which
is
what
the
unit
of
the
offense
is
under
section
924(c),
specifically
whether
using
multiple
firearms
to
do
a
single
crime
is
a
single
or
a
multiple
crime
under
section
924(c).
and
in
those,
based
on
guidance
from
this
court
in
busic
and
from
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
told
us,
we
have
taken
the
view
that
if
a
person
uses
more
than
one
firearm
to
do
a
single
crime
of
violence,
that
is
a
single
crime
under
section
924(c).
those
are
the
cases
that
she
is
pointing
to,
and
those
raise
an
entirely
different
issue
that
is
not
raised
in
this
case
because
it
is
conceded
here
that
he
is
guilty
of
six
different
924(c)
crimes.
now,
the
important
point
about
924(c),
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
is
that
this
is
not
a
recidivist
statute
but
a
dangerous
person
statute.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
is
generally
the
case,
justice
kennedy,
that
if
a
person
is
guilty
of
two
crimes
of
violence
that
he
does
as
part
of
the
same
episode,
it
is
true
that
two
924(c)
crimes
could
be
charged.
i
don't
understand
the
facts
that
you
gave
me
as
really
raising
that,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
separate
taking
of
the
bonds
as
part
of
the
same
bank
robbery
would
necessarily
be
a
separate
crime
of
violence.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
am
answering
yes
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
if
a
person,
as
part
of
a
single
criminal
episode,
is
guilty
of
more
than
one
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime,
it
is
in
fact
the
case
under
our
reading
of
the
statute
that
if
he
uses
a
firearm
with
respect
to
each
of
those
crimes
and
thereby
makes
more
grave
each
of
them,
that
he
would
be
subject
to
two
separate
counts
under
section
924(c).
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right.
and
in
other
circumstances
where
congress
has
thought
that
type
of
a
circumstance
significant,
for
example
in
section
924(e),
it
has
expressly
stated
that
the
crimes
must
be,
must
happen
on
occasions
different
from
one
another.
and
congress
knows
fairly
well
to
write,
how
to
deal
with
that
type
of
issue
if
it
thinks
it
should
make
a
difference.
with
respect
to
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
teach
a
person
a
lesson,
as
i
stated
earlier,
it
is
not.
it
is
a
dangerous
person
statute.
and
in
fact
it
bears
very
little
resemblance
to
a
true
recidivist
statute.
when
congress
has
enacted
a
true
recidivist
statute
it
has
generally
been
quite
explicit
about
the
level
of
finality
that
a
conviction
must
have
attained
in
order
for
it
to
count
under
that
statute.
and
i
think
all
of
the
several
statutes
that
we
have
cited
in
title
xxi
in
the
narcotics
area
are
fairly
instructive
on
that
score.
in
addition,
it
would
be
an
odd
recidivist
statute
that
asks
not
only
whether
the
defendant
had
served
time
in
jail
before
for
any
crime
or
whether
he
had
served
time
in
jail
for
a
state
or
federal
crime
of
the
same
general
type
as
he
is
now
charged
with,
those
are
clearly
the
case
here,
but
which
asks
whether
he
had
served
that
time
in
jail
under
this
subsection
of
this
statute
and
no
other.
and
that
is
a
very
strange
version
of
a
recidivist
statute.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
there
is
none
as
to
the
issue
raised
in
this
case,
your
honor.
it
is
certainly--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--none
as
used
in
this
statute.
we
readily
concede
that
with
every
other
word,
that
as
with
every
other
word
in
the
english
language
it
is
possible
that
each
of
the
words
used
conceivably
might
have
a
different
meaning.
what
is
important
and
dispositive
in
this
case--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there
is
no
ambiguity
whatever
in
those
words.
the
thought
that
in
the
case
of,
for
example,
might
mean
in
the
legal
case
of
makes
no
sense
for
three
reasons.
the
first
one
is
that
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
words
in
the
case
of
is
simply
in
the
event
of,
and
that
is
how
the
expression
is
used
in
everyday
language.
the
second
one
is
that
even
reading
the
word
case
to
mean
legal
case
doesn't
really
do
anything
for
mr.
deal's
case
unless
he
also
adds
words
like
involving
or
similar
words,
as
he
does
in
his
reply
brief
i
think
at
page
7,
whose
purpose
is
essentially
to
nullify
the
choice
of
tense
that
congress
placed
into
the
statute.
it
is
those
words,
which
are
in
essence
fudge
words,
that
really
do
the
work
for
the
alternative
version
of
the
statute
that
is
being
urged.
and
finally,
that
reading
wouldn't
make
sense
as
well
because
saying
that
case
means
legal
case
would
turn
the
result
of
each
case
on
how
counts
are
joined
in
that
case
by
the
government.
that
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
a
sentencing
statute
because
sentencing
statutes
usually
deal
with
the
defendant's
conduct,
to
what
he
did,
not
to
how
he
was
charged
and
tried.
and
all
of
those
reasons
i
think
clearly
indicate
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
in
case
of
is
simply
in
the
event
of.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
again,
i
think
it
is
possible
to
read
the
word
subsequent
in
isolation
to
have
more
than
one
meaning.
our
submission
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
each
of
the
words
second
or
subsequent
take
meaning
from
the
other
and
make
the
context
clear.
for
example,
it
is
a
possible
meaning
of
the
word
second
that
it
is
the
sixtieth
part
of
a
minute.
no
one
has
ever
said
that
that
might
be
the
meaning
in
this
case
for
the
obvious
reason
that
everyone
understands
that
in
this
context
that
can't
be
the
meaning.
again,
we
think
that
as
used
in
the
statute
the
expression
second
or
subsequent
really
means
another
finding
of
guilt
at
any
time
after
the
first.
finally,
as
to
the
word
conviction--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
i
think
it
can
mean
in
addition
to
the
first.
in
order
or
in
time,
or
at
any
time.
but
i
think
that
given
our
reading
of
the
word
second
to
mean
what
its
plain
language
says,
something
that
follows
the
first
either
in
time
or
in
number
sequence,
or
simply
the
number
2
in
a
countable
series,
it
is
the
case
that
it
can
be
in
time
or
in
order
and
the
statute
clearly
encompasses
both.
as
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
following...
excuse
me,
to
the
final
word
that
is
of
consequence
here,
justice
o'connor,
which
is
the
word
conviction,
again
we
readily
concede
that
there
may
be
other
contexts
in
which
the
word
taken
in
isolation
might
mean
a
judgment
of
conviction.
in
this
case
it
is
clear
from
the
context
that
its
ordinary
rather
than
its
technical
meaning
is
intended.
the
statute
by
its
plain
terms
sets
forth
a
chronological
order
in
which
events
are
to
occur.
before
a
20-year
sentence
may
be
imposed
there
must
be
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction.
the
statute
therefore
makes
it
clear
that
the,
excuse
me,
that
the
conviction
must
come
before
the
sentence,
and
therefore
conviction
cannot
mean
a
judgment
which
already
incorporates
a
sentence.
now,
i
think
the
government--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
think
it's
a
problem
for
any
of
them,
justice
scalia.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
certainly.
we
think
that
our
submission
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
also
reinforced
by
the
history
of
section
924(c)
because,
as
this
court
indicated
in
busic
and
in
lewis,
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
in
general
and
section
924(c)
specifically
were
passed
in
1968
in
response
to
an
unprecedented
wave
of
assassinations,
riots,
and
violent
crime.
since
1968
congress
repeatedly
has
thought,
sought,
excuse
me,
to
turn
the
screw
on
armed
violent
crime,
to
single
out
those
instances
of
armed
conduct
that
give
rise
to
intolerable
risks
to
human
life.
by
and
large
the
changes
that
congress
has
made
to
the
scope
of
the
statute
since
1968
or
to
the
scale
of
its
penalties,
including
its
1984
decision
to
change
the
result
in
busic,
manifest
an
attitude
not
of
leniency
but
of
increasing
severity
toward
this
very
serious
problem.
the
second
or
subsequent
clause
in
our
view
is
a
plain
dangerous
person
statute
and
is
not
different
from
those
other
steps
that
congress
has
taken.
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
tenth
circuit,
every
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
issue
that
is
raised
here
has
discerned
congress'
intent
from
the
clear
language
of
section
924(c),
and
because
that
language
is
indeed
clear
we
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
cannot
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens,
for
the
reason
that
we
have
taken
the
view
that
if
one
were
to
read
the
word
conviction
to
mean
a
judgment
the
statute
would
make
no
sense.
and
if
we
were
not
told
anything
more
than
is
in
your
question
right
now
we
would
not
know
what
follows
from
that
decision.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
on
that
theory,
and
if
that
were
all
the
court
said,
justice
stevens,
the
judgment
would
be
vacated
and
sent
back
to
the
district
court
where
we
would
move
to
sever
the
sentences.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
would
have,
on
that
reading--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that
is
what
does
normally
happen
at
the
end
of
what
happens
in
the
district
court.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
justice
white,
and
i
think
the,
how
that
is
treated
tends
to
vary
from
district
to
district.
ms.
young
indicated
that
in
her
district
this
is
thought
of
as
a
single
judgment.
i
formerly
worked
in
a
different
federal
district
in
new
york
city
where
the
document
was
called
a
judgment
and
commitment
order,
and
it
was
thought
there
to
incorporate
several
judgments
as
to
each
of
the
counts.
so
i
think
this
is
a
matter
that
is
thought
of
differently
in
every
district.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
right.
that
the
statute
as
written,
and
especially
in
light
of
the
tense
congress
chose,
would
make
no
sense
because
whereas
the
statute
sets
forth
a
clear
order
in
which
events
are
to
occur
and
that
therefore
dictates
that
the
conviction
must
come
before
the
sentence,
you
would
be
reading
the
word
conviction
to
include
the
sentence,
which
in
this
context
we
think
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right.
federal
rule
32(b)(1)
says
exactly
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
we
will
rest
on
our
briefs.
thank
you.
