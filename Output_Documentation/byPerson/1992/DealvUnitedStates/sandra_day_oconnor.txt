justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
could,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
the
district
judge
at
sentencing
in
this
case
might
say,
after
having
sentenced
on
the
first
count,
now
i'm
about
to
enter
a
second
judgment
of
conviction.
therefore
this
is
a
case
of
a
second
judgment
of
conviction
and
therefore
the
20-year
provision
applies.
i
mean,
you
can
certainly
read
the
statute
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
did
we
say
in
dickerson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
we
said
conviction
meant
it
didn't
occur
with
the
entry
of
the
plea,
but
only
after
the
sentence
and
judgment
were
imposed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
estrada,
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
whatever
in
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
asking
you
about
the
statute.
is
it,
is
there
no
ambiguity
in
the
meaning
of
the
term
conviction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
term
in
the
case
of
a
second
or
subsequent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
word
subsequent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
dickerson
does
point
in
the
direction
that
supports
mr.
estrada
more
than
it
supports
your
view
that
there
has
to
be
a
sentence
actually
imposed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
do
have
here
ultimately
a
determination
by
the
judge
on
each
count
that
there
is
guilt
and
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
on
each
count.
we
do
have
that
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
then
the
judge
followed
through
and
imposed
a
sentence
separately
on
each
count.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
for
your
purposes
we
just
have
to
come
to
grips
with
any
ambiguity
perhaps
in
the
case
of
any
second
or
subsequent--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
meaning
of
that
language.
