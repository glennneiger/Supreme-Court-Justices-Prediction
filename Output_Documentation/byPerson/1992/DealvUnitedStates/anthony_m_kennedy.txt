justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
read
the
statute
as
if
it
said
after
conviction
in
a
second
or
subsequent
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
way
you
would
have
us
interpret
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
second
or
subsequent
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
actually
you
would
say
after
conviction
and
after
the
sentence
has
been
served?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
that
is
inconsistent
with
your
own
interpretation
of
the
second
use
of
the
term
conviction,
where
the
statute
directs
that
the
sentence
not
be
suspended.
it's
a
very
odd
result
to
say
you
can't
suspend
a
sentence
until
after
the
sentence
has
been
served.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
were
arguing
that
the
second
use
of
the
word
conviction
in
the
statute,
which
says
that
the
judge
shall
not
place
on
probation,
the
court
shall
not
place
on
probation
or
suspend
the
sentence
of
any
person
convicted,
has
bearing
on
the
definition
of
the
word
conviction
in
the
statute.
it's
a
very
strange
construction
to
say
that
he
cannot
suspend
the
sentence
until
after
the
sentence
has
been
completed.
so
therefore
the
use
of
the
term
conviction
cannot
comprehend
the
serving
of
the
sentence
or
that
sentence
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose,
mr.
estrada,
that
if
a
person
robs
a
single
bank
on
a
single
day
and
takes
both
money
and
government
securities
as
part
of
the
hold
up
and
there
are
two
counts,
that
the
consecutive
sentence
rule
or
the
enhanced
sentence
rule
would
apply
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
there
were
two
counts
charged.
i
certainly
think
that
it
would
be
more
serious
to
take
bonds
and
money
than
just
money.
suppose
two
counts
were
charged.
what
would
be
the
result
under
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
it's
really
one
episode.
