okay.
ms.
young,
do
we
know
that...
how
do
we
know
this
is
a
recidivist
statute?
maybe
it's
just
a
habitual
criminal
statute.
you
seem
to
think
that
the
only
reason
for
imposing
greater
sentences
for
the
later
crime
is
that
this
guy
just
doesn't
learn
from
being
in
jail.
maybe
another
reason
is,
whether
he
has
been
in
jail
or
not,
people
who
are
habitual
criminals
are
worse
than
people
who
on
one
occasion
robbed
a
bank.
this
guy
robbed
six
banks,
one
after
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know,
so
we
have
to
look
to
the
text,
i
assume.
and
what
the
text
says,
in
the
case
of
his
second
or
subsequent
conviction.
it
seems
to
me
the
most
you
can
make
out
of
that,
the
very
most
is
that
the
first
conviction
has
to
have
been
final
before
the
second,
which
means
in
justice
white's
hypothetical
you
would
have
to
say
so
long
as
he
has
been
sentenced
on
the
first
count,
when
he
is
sentenced
for
the
second
count
you
are
dealing
with
in
the
case
of
a
second
conviction
and
he
should
get
the
enhanced
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
means
second
in
time,
don't
you
think?
what
else
could
it
mean?
second
or
subsequent.
subsequent--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
but
what
you're
applying
that
after
to
is
not
the
later
case.
you're
really
reading
it
to
say
in
the
case
of...
not
in
the
case
of
his
second
or
subsequent
conviction,
but
you're
saying
in
a
case
involving
criminal
activity,
alleged
criminal
activity
that
occurred
after
his
first
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
insist
not
just
that
the
case
be
second,
but
that
the
criminal,
alleged
criminal
activity
upon
which
the
case
is
based
be
second.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
i
mean,
i
can
follow
you
the
first
step,
that
the
case
has
to
be
second,
although
i
can't
see
why
anyone
would
want
such
a
disposition,
why
you
would
insist
on
six
separate
trials
instead
of
one
trial
in
order
to
get
the
enhancement.
it
makes
no
sense.
your
disposition
makes
some
sense,
it
turns
this
into
a
recidivist
statute,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
it
out
of
the
language.
all
it
says
is
in
the
case
of
his
second
or
subsequent
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
subsequent
offense
would
be
better
for
your
position,
wouldn't
it,
i
mean
if
it
had
read
subsequent
offense
it
would
make
your
argument
easier,
i
assume?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
no.
you
want
to
go
further
than
that.
you
want
to
say
it
has
to
be
subsequent
to
serving
a
sentence.
the
options
are
not
conviction
or
offense,
subsequent
to
a
prior
conviction
or
subsequent
to
a
prior
offense.
that
won't
satisfy
you.
you
insist
that
it
be
subsequent
to
serving
the
sentence
from
the
prior
conviction.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
have
at
least
begun
to
serve
your
sentence,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
imposition
of
the
sentence,
the
serving
of
the
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
immediately.
you're
immediately
in
custody.
well
then,
then
if
you
sentence
the
person
in
six
separate
counts,
one
after
another,
he
immediately
begins
serving
the
first
count
as
soon
as
you
sentence
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
offense
hasn't
occurred
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
haven't
argued
that
because
it
makes
it
really
a
very
silly
statute.
it
means
that
you
can
give
this
person
100
years
if
you
bring
six
separate
prosecutions,
but
you
can't
if
you
join
them
all
in
one.
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
that?
when
did
it
eliminate
the
overlapping?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
date.
please
finish
the
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
after
the
first
in
time?
it
must
be
after
the
first
in
time,
and
not
just
in
addition
to
the
first?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
would
only
be
a
problem
for
the
second
one.
after
the
second
one
you
would
be
okay,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
would
have
two
before.
i
mean,
with
the
second
one...
well--
