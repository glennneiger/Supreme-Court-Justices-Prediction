justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
this
case,
ms.
young,
how
many
judgments
were
entered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
judgment
including,
all
the
sentences
on
all
the
counts
were
incorporated
in
a
single
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
say
in
this
case
there
was
one
conviction,
as
you
define
the
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question,
what
is
your
experience?
do
the
trial
judges
normally
enter
separate
judgments
on
each
of
several
counts
or
do
they
generally
enter
one
judgment
covering
the
whole
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada,
is
ms.
young
correct
when
she
told
us
that
from
1968
to
1987
the
prosecutors
did
not
read
the
statute
this
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
in
all
those
years
there
were
no
charges
where
the
defendant
had
robbed
more
than
one
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
obviously
it
wasn't
appealed
on
this
issue
if
the
practice
was
always
to
do
as
she
says
the
right
reading
of
the
statute
is.
but
was
that,
i'm
asking
you
do
you
think
that
was
the
practice
or
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
telling
me
you
really
don't
know
what
the
practice
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she
is
correct
that
it
wasn't
litigated
until
1987?
justice
john
paul
stevens
eleventh
circuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1987.
justice
john
paul
stevens
19
years
after
the
statute
had
been
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
not
sufficient
to
justify
a
defendant
having
an
interest
in
appealing
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
you
didn't
think
a
defendant
would
appeal
a
10-year
enhancement
but
he
would
appeal
a
30-year
enhancement?
that's
what
you're
saying
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
one
more
question?
would
you
agree
that
if
one
should
read
the
word
conviction
to
mean
judgment,
that
then
the
judgment
has
to
be
reversed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
would
know
there
have
to
be
at
least
two
judgments,
because
it
has
talked
about
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
or
judgment.
i
suppose
one
judgment
could
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
needing
a
second
or
subsequent
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree
there
would
have
to
be
some,
at
least
have
to
be
sent
back
to
the
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
have
to
do
that
in
every
case
where
the
district
judge
made
a
mistake
of
entering
just
one
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
what
normally
happens
at
the
end
of
criminal
trials.
