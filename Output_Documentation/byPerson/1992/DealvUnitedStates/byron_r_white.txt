justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
six
counts
were
bank
robbery,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
different
dates
and
different
places,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
there
had
just
been,
if
there
had
just
been
separate
indictments
for
the
six
bank
robberies,
one
indictment
for
each
bank
robbery,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
the,
there
was
a
bank
robbery
by
your
client
and
he
was
indicted
and
convicted
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
similarly
for
the
other
five.
wouldn't
the
statute
apply,
the
enhancement
apply
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
would
enhancement
ever
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's...
i
thought
i
was
posing
that
in
my
last
hypothetical.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
after,
you
mean
after
he
had
served
the
5-year
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
conviction
word
used
in
this
enhancement
provision
refers
to
a
criminal
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
return
of
the
jury
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it
enough
for
you
to
say,
well,
second
or
subsequent
conviction
means
second
or
subsequent
judgment?
and
there
was
only
one
judgment
here
so
why
shouldn't
you
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
does
say
second
or
subsequent
judgment
because
it
says
second
or
subsequent
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
win
more
than
you
have
to
to
win
your
case
here.
there
is
only
one
judgment.
there
is
not
a
second
or
subsequent
judgment
on
which
there
can
be
an
enhancement.
why
isn't
that
enough
to
solve
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
a
conviction
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
jury,
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
conviction
happens
when
the
jury
verdict
is
returned?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
enter
a
judgment
on
it
before
there
is
a
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
you
say
the
conviction
occurs
with
the
return
of
the
jury
verdict,
there
was
only
one
conviction
here.
the,
there
was
only
one
verdict.
one
verdict
came
in.
there
wasn't
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
in
the
sense
of
a
second
or
subsequent
jury
verdict,
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
wasn't
a
second
finding,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
rely
on
second
rather
than
subsequent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
jury
must
have,
the
jury
couldn't
have
considered
all
counts
at
the
same
time,
so
at
least
they
had
to
consider
them
separately
and
so
their
finding
of
guilt
on
each,
for
each
bank
robbery,
they
were...
some
were
later
and
some
were
earlier.
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
strange.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
piece
of
paper
entitled
judgment,
i
suppose,
could,
you
could
say
that
that
really
is
several
judgments
because
he
has
entered
judgment
on
several
counts.
