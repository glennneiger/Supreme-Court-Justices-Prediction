chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-8199,
thomas
lee
deal
v.
the
united
states.
ms.
young,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
your
position,
ms.
young,
that
the
rule
of
lenity
is
required
by
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say...
what
meaning
is
it
you
attach
to
the
words
in
the
case
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
why,
don't
we
use
the
phrase
in
the
case
of
very
often
just
to
identify
a
particular
episode
that
doesn't
necessarily
have
anything
to
do
with
a
legal
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
case
would
you
cite
for
the
proposition
that
you
just
stated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
finding
of
guilt
plus
a
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
if
the
judge,
on
the
basis
of
the
jury's
verdict,
says
with
respect
to
the
first
count,
you
know,
i
sentence
you
to
5
years,
why
isn't
that
then
final
if
you
agree
with
the
question
that
i
just
asked
you?
so
that
when
the
time
comes
to
impose
the
sentence
on
the
second
count,
it
is
final
since
there
has
been
not
only
a
finding
of
guilt
but
a
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
what
was
your
argument
about
lack
of
finality
addressed,
ms.
young,
because
i
assume
from
your
answers
that
you
have
just
given
that
you
do
not
think
that
a
jury
verdict
of
guilt
plus
a
sentence
indicates
lack
of
finality?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
wherein
does
the
lack
of
finality
occur
that
you
object
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
conviction
would
refer
to
a
finding
of
guilt
plus
a
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
trial
court
could
have
changed
all
that
on
the
basis
of
the
same
jury
verdict
had
he
simply
entered
six
judgments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
should
it
then
depend
on
whether
or
not
there
was
one
judgment
based
on
six
convictions
or
six
different
judgments
based
on
six
findings
of
guilt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ought
the
outcome
in
this
case,
whether
your
client
is
sentenced
to
40
years,
as
you
say
he
should
be,
or
105,
ought
it
to
depend
on
whether
the
trial
court
says
i
am
going
to
enter
six
different
judgments
here
because
there
have
been
six
different
findings
of
guilt
by
the
jury,
or
if
he
says
there
have
been
six
different
findings
of
guilt
by
the
jury
but
i
am
going
to
enter
just
one
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
young.
mr.
estrada,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
contemplate
that
the
judgment
will
occur
after
the
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
ms.
young,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
had
there,
was
it
not,
ms.
young,
was
a
plea
of
guilty?
no
finding
of
guilt
and
no
sentence,
but
placing
on
probation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
said
that's
enough
to
amount
to
a
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
not
any
finding
of
guilt
in
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
young.
the
case
is
submitted.
