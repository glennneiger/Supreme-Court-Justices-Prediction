justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
your
argument
be
served
going
back
to
justice
white's
hypo?
if
he
had
been
sentenced
to
the
5-years
enhancement
and
if
for
some
reason
he
escaped
from
custody
before
being
sent
to
prison
and
committed
another
bank
robbery,
wouldn't
he
be
subject
to
the
second
enhancement
for
that
even
though
he
had
not
served
the
first
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
on
your
theory
that
it's
a
recidivism
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off
there,
but
i
just
thought
on
your
own
argument
that
in
the
case
that
i
give
he
would
be
subject
to
the
second
enhancement.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
your
strongest
argument
that
the
ambiguity
simply
in
here
is
in
the
word,
in
the
referent
to
the
word
subsequent?
you
don't
know
whether
it
means
subsequent
to,
an
offense
subsequent
to
another
offense
or
an
offense
subsequent
to
a
prior
conviction.
that's
your
ambiguity
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
because
you
answered
an
earlier
question
of
mine
in
which
i
posed
the
situation
in
which
the
individual
is
sentenced
and
immediately
escapes.
he
runs
out
of
the
courtroom
and
commits
another
robbery.
in
that
case
you
agreed
that
the
20-year
enhancement
could
be
applied
when
he
was
convicted
for
the
second
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
that
be
clear
if
the
enhancement
were
the
same
in
each
instance,
but
in
this
case
the
enhancement
is
4
times
for
the
second
or
subsequent
what
it
is
in
the
first,
which
indicates
that
it's
something
other
than
just
a
dangerous
person
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
get
into
comparative
danger
you
are
getting
into
recidivism,
aren't
you?
in
other
words
this
is
a
person
who
does
not
learn
from
his
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
on
your,
if
i
recall,
your
argument
is
that
judgment
can
never
mean
final
judgment
here
because
that
doesn't
occur
until
after
the
sentencing
and
therefore
you
would
have
the
anomaly
of
having
an
addition
to
the
sentence
after
the
sentencing
was
complete
and
judgment
had
been
entered.
