we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
92-621,
donald
neal
rake
v.
william
j.
rade...
wade,
pardon
me.
mr.
carpenter.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
what
scenario?
i
didn't
get
what
adjective
you
used.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
acceleration
clauses
in
the...
in
the
mortgage...
typical
mortgage,
then,
are...
are
set
aside.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
requires
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
going
to
follow
just
the
contract,
certainly
if
the
mortgagee
here
had
been
allowed
to
accelerate,
the
accelerated
principal
would
have
borne
interest,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
to
that
extent,
the
mortgagee
is
being
deprived
of
something
that
he
would
have
had
under
the
contract.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
we
ought
to
hold
these
people
to
the
terms
of
their
contract.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
not
to
the
other
provisions.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
carpenter.
mr.
johnson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you...
will
you
tell
me
again
the
section
that
you
say
you
rely
on?
you
said
1325(b)(2).
chief
justice
rehnquist
wait...
wait
a
minute.
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
whereabouts
on
a-5?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's...
that
would
be
section
1325(a)(b)(ii).
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
johnson,
i
don't
see
anywhere
in
your...
either
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
petitioner
for
certiorari,
where
any
question
regarding
the
rate
of
interest
is
presented.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
a
federal
rule
of
interest.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
brief
the...
did
you
brief
the
question
of
the
rate
of
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you're
asking...
so
you're
asking
us
to
decide
it
without
it
being
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
without
your
having
briefed
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
mann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mann.
mr.
carpenter,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
should
congress...
you're
saying
congress
may
favor
the
general
creditors,
but
why
should
congress
single
out
the
home
mortgagee
for
disfavorable
treatment
as
compared
to
other
secured
claimants?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
other
than
the
ways
you
say
it
can
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carpenter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
