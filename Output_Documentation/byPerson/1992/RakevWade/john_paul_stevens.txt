justice
stevens
of
course,
they
say
the
opposite
on
page
15,
so
you
can...
you
can...
you
can
adopt
their
view
without
losing
anything.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
you
say
there's
no
question
about
your
right
to
it
if...
prepetition
interest,
but
under
state
law
you
wouldn't
get
interest
on
the
arrearage,
would
you?
justice
stevens
on
the...
on
the
arrearage.
justice
stevens
even
though
it's
not
provided
for
in
the
contract.
justice
stevens
but
you
can't
forum
shop
for
your
home
mortgage.
you
can't
move
the
home
around.
justice
stevens
it
has
to
be
the
principal
residence,
doesn't
it.
justice
stevens
but
you
do...
but
under
the
tenth
circuit
rationale
you
wouldn't
get
interest
on
the
fees,
would
you?
justice
stevens
i
thought
they
relied
on
506(b).
justice
stevens
but
the
fees
are
after
the
comma.
justice
stevens
oh,
no,
the
comma--
justice
stevens
--you
ignore
the
comma
in
506(b)
for
your
purposes,
then.
that's
not
what
the
court
did
in
ron
pair.
justice
stevens
yeah,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
if
it
is
so
clear
that
it
covers
the
compensation
for
delay
in
payment,
why
do
you
suppose
they
didn't
tell
us
how
to
figure
out
the
interest
rate?
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
we'd
ignored
the
common
interest
rule
in...
after
interest
in
ron
pair,
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem,
because
the
interest
would
have
been
set
by
the
instrument
itself
then.
justice
stevens
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem,
yeah.
justice
stevens
tell
me,
what
is
the
provision
that
disallows
interest
generally
again?
justice
stevens
502(b)(2).
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
you
think
the
legislative
history
is
against
you?
justice
stevens
excuse
me.
gee,
if
you
take
that
position,
strictly
speaking,
to
allow
a
cure
is
simply
to
allow
you,
right
now,
to
pony
up
all
the
money
that's
due.
that's
allowing
a
cure.
justice
stevens
you--
justice
stevens
--what?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this
modification
issue?
as
i
understand
the
claim
here,
it's
just
for
the
arrearages,
it's
not
for
the
balance
due
on
the
entire
note.
and
the...
if...
in
your
view,
if
they
fail
to
make...
comply
with
the
plan,
covering...
making
the
cure
in
monthly
payments
over
a
period
of
time,
would
the
mortgagee
retain
the
right
to
accelerate
the
basic
note
and
foreclose?
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
what
if--
justice
stevens
--but
after...
i'm
assuming
after
confirmation
of
the
plan,
and
they
go...
makes
payments
say...
i
think
under
this
it's
5
years,
wasn't
it,
to
pay
this
off,
or
whatever
period.
justice
stevens
but
2
or
3
years
later
he
misses
a
payment,
and
then
the
mortgagee
would
still
have
the
right
to
accelerate,
wouldn't
they,
to
foreclose.
justice
stevens
subject
to
approval
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
justice
stevens
so
there
has
not
been
a
modification
that
included
a
surrender
of
the
right
to
accelerate.
justice
stevens
just
a
postponement
of
it,
if
they--
justice
stevens
mr.
carpenter,
your
adversary
says
that
they
would
get
this
interest
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
so
it
wouldn't
be
expansion.
justice
stevens
no,
but
if
they
did
foreclose
and
you
got
a
judgment,
then
they
would
get
this
interest,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well
maybe
so,
but
at
least
conceptually
it
does
compensate
them
for
the
delay.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree...
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
you
argue,
of
course,
that
1325(a)(5)(a)(2)
is
not
applicable.
justice
stevens
now,
do
you
agree,
though,
that
if
it
were
applicable,
it
would
compel
a
payment
of
interest
on
the
arrearage?
justice
stevens
well,
i
know...
don't
say
it's
not
applicable.
that's
not
my
question.
justice
stevens
if
it
were
applicable,
would
you
agree
that
interest
was
due?
