justice
white
are
you
to
talk
about
the
statutory
provisions?
justice
white
in
what...
and
you
rely
on
1322(b)(2).
justice
white
well,
you
say...
you
say
that
1322(b)(2)
prohibits
modification
of
the
terms
of
the
mortgage.
justice
white
well,
by
extending
the
time
for
payments
you
certainly
are...
are
modifying
the
terms
of
the
mortgage,
aren't
you?
justice
white
the
plan...
the
plan
provides
for
extended
payments,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
uh-hum.
justice
white
uh-hum.
justice
white
what
section
do
you
rely
on
specifically
to
give
you
a
right
to
interest?
justice
white
you
don't
think
506(b)'s
got
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
white
(b).
justice
white
so,
for
what
period
or
periods
of
time
are
you
asking
interest?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
and
there's
no
question,
at
repetition
you
would
have
a
right
to
interest.
justice
white
yes,
yes.
justice
white
you
have
to...
you
filed
a
claim
in
this
case.
justice
white
and
you
asked
for...
you
asked
for
interest
on
the
arrearages,
i
suppose.
justice
white
was
it
allowed
as
a
secured
claim?
justice
white
all
right,
all
right.
and
at
what
rate?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
that's
all
right.
justice
white
so
what...
506...
506
gives
you
interest
postpetition.
justice
white
at
what
rate?
justice
white
all
right.
so,
but--
justice
white
--all
right,
all
right.
and
that's
what
you're
asking
for
your...
in
this
case,
for
all
of
the
interest
you
claim.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
now,
do
you
support
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
white
and
the
rationale?
justice
white
so
you
want
it
affirmed
on
another...
on
another
basis.
justice
white
so
you
think
if
we
just...
if
we
followed
the
rationale
of
the
tenth
circuit
we
would
be
in
error.
justice
white
but
you
wouldn't
mind...
you
wouldn't
mind
if
we
agreed
with
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
white
well,
you
say
on
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
is
federal
law.
