mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
confusions
has
been
the
lack
of
attention
to
text
in
the
interpretation
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
ron
pair
was
singular
in
breaking
that,
in
that
the
courts
looked
at
the
text
and
said
we're
going
to
follow
the
text,
that
legislative
history
is
not
relevant
where
there's
no
ambiguity,
this
is
a
clear
statute.
506(b)
only
provides
for
interest
postpetition.
it
doesn't
have
any...
really,
any
relevance
to
the
fact
of
what's
going
to
be
after
confirmation.
1322(b)...
i
mean
(b)(5)
calls
for
a
cure.
in
my
research,
cure
was
first
found
in
louisville
v.
radford.
cure
says,
"cure
the
default".
in
most
instances
in
chapter
13
bankruptcies,
there's
a
race
to
the
court.
the
mortgagee
has
accelerated,
he's
filed
foreclosure
and
obtained
a
valid
judgment
in
the
state
court.
when
the
chapter
13
is
filed,
362
stays
his
right
to
accelerate,
to
foreclose,
to
take
possession,
as
you
will.
these
are
serious
modifications
that
are
found
under
362.
506(b)
only
provides
pre-code
recognition
under
vanston
bondholders
to
his
right
of
interest
postpetition,
whereas
any
other
creditors,
under
secured
creditors,
unsecured
creditors,
are
not
entitled
to
interest.
so
(b)(5)
only
has
that
application.
it's
when
you
get
to
section
1322(b)(2)
that
it
calls
for
interest
upon
the
allowed
claim.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
506(b).
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
506(b),
justice
scalia,
gives
you
interest
under
vanston,
pre-code,
from
postpetition
up
to
the
time
of
confirmation.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
i'm
talking
about...
1325(b)(2)
is
the
time
value
statute
that
applies
to
the
forced
loan
that
is
brought
upon
the
mortgagee.
we
are
forced
to
endure
delay
in
payment
for
a
period
of
3,
now
getting
more
and
more,
5
years.
now,
when
we
talk
about
the
approved
claim
that
we're
talking
about,
or
the
allowed
claim,
one
must
look
at
official
form
10
of
the
bankruptcy
forms
for
filing
a
claim
in
a
chapter
13
case.
it's
two-horned.
you
file
for
what
your
balance
is
due,
then
you
file
for
what
your
arrearages
are.
depending
upon
the
nature
of
acceleration,
your
arrearages
may
not
include
anything
but
interest.
however,
if
you
filed
a
foreclosure
action
and
you
had
to
advance
insurance,
had
to
advance
title
report,
court
costs,
endure...
incur
attorney
fees;
sometimes
in
a...
in
a
contested
case
they
can
be
quite
substantial.
those
are
part
of
the
arrearage
claim.
there
are
two
claims
when
you...
when
you
have
this
term
13.
you
have
an
allowed
claim
for
the
balance
due
upon
the
mortgage.
then
if
you
have
$5,000
or
$6,000
in
arrearages
that
you
incurred
prepetition
in
acceleration
in
the
state
court,
those
are
part
of
what
comes
under
1322(b)(5),
cure.
that
cure
was
dealt
with
by
congress
in
the
10
years
that
the
committee
was
to
undergo
the
modernization
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
they
came
across
with
a
sweeping
statement
that
the
bankruptcy
code
could
modify...
and
that
term
is
likewise
first
used
in
louisville
v.
radford.
they
could
modify
secured
claims.
well,
that's
not
really
clear
what
that
term
"modify"
means,
except
that
radford
said
"modify"
means
modify
substantive
claims,
and
that
includes
many
factors.
for
instance,
the
very
essence
of
a
mortgage
is
full
payment
with
interest.
that
was
discussed
at
length
in
the
radford
case.
and
whether
or
not
the
payment
of
interest
is
a
substantive
right
subject
to
modification
was
not
clear.
but
when
this
committee
report
was
approved
by
the
house
and
sent
to
the
senate,
it
still
contained
this...
this
broad
sweeping
power
of
congress
under
the
code
to
be
able
to
modify
secured
claims.
mr.
vaughn
from
the
american
bankers'
association
and
mr.
wies
from
the
american
mortgage
bankers'
association
appeared
at
the
senate
hearings
and
objected
not
to
the
deacceleration
clause
of
1322(b)(5).
they
objected
to
two
things:
the
bifurcation
and
the
modification
of
the
home
mortgage.
so
the
senate
then
had
a
compromise
amendment
that
went
back,
and
that
was
what
is
now
the
present
code
provision,
that
you
can
modify
secured
claims
under
(b)(2),
but
not
secured
claims
where
you
have
a
first
lien
upon
the
principal
residence
of
the
debtor.
now,
that
says
nothing
about
whether
you're
an
unsecured
creditor
or
an
oversecured
creditor.
it
means
that
because
of
the
social
purpose,
the
good
acts
that
the
mortgage
association
does
in
encouraging
homeownership
and
protecting
mortgage...
mortgages,
that
we're
going
to
protect
mortgages,
these
particular
mortgages,
against
modification.
and
as
i
set
out
in
my
brief,
there
are
all
sorts
of
violence
that's
being
performed
under
the
excuse
that
we're
not
modifying.
as
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist
said,
when
you're
deaccelerating,
you're
certainly
modifying
a
right.
you're
modifying
the
right
to
accelerate,
you're
modifying
the
right
to
proceed
to
foreclosure.
but
then,
what
other
things
can
be
modified?
well,
here
we
have
a
right
to
be
paid
in
full,
to
have
our
lien
pass
through
bankruptcy,
as
in
dewsnup
v.
timm.
we
have
a
right
to
full
payment
with
interest,
and
we
believe
that
these
are
substantive
rights.
yet,
as
you
will
hear
next
month,
if
i
have
a
mortgage
for
$50,000
on
a
$100,000
piece
of
property,
i
can
be
stripped
$50,000.
in
other
words,
my
mortgage
is
there
unsecured
as
to
$50,000
and
secured
to
$50,000,
but
the
courts
say
that
that's
not
modification.
hence
the
confusion
and
hence
why
we
are
here
in
this
particular
case,
dealing
with
interest
on
arrearages.
this
court
has
had
a
long-standing
rule
that
was
started
back
in
the
thirties
where
in
billings
v.
united
states,
at
232
u.s.
261,
it
said,
"it
was
long
ago
here
decided,
in
view
of
the
true
conception
of
interest,
that
a
statute
was
not
necessary
to
compel
its
payment
where,
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
equity
and
justice
and
enforcement
of
an
obligation,
interest
should
be
allowed.
"
it
was
strange
that
in
the
history
of
the
world,
in
the
law
of
moses,
the
12
tablets
of
rome,
even
the
church
of
england
found
that
the
exaction
of
interest
was
ungodly.
and
it
wasn't
until
the
common
law
in
the
united
states
that
interest
was
allowed
by
the
courts,
and
certainly
a
departure
from
the
common
law
of
england
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
written.
so
interest,
in
the
federal
context,
has
always
been
allowed
by
the
courts
in
the
breach
of
an
obligation
where
you
had
an
expectation
of
payment.
now,
1322(b)(5)
really
says
to
the
debtor
pay
what
you
owe
now
if
you
have
an
arrearage,
and
it's
equivalent
to
pay
what
you
owe
over
a
period
of
time
with
time
value
interest.
but
if
you
pay
in
full
what
you
owe
over
a
period
of
time
without
time
value
interest,
it's
not
equivalent
to,
quote,
pay
what
you
owe
now.
there
is
a
question
begging
in
this
case
as
to
what
rate
of
interest.
are
we
going
to
have
the
state
law
application
of
interest
or
are
we
going
to
have
a
federal
application
of
interest?
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
1325(b)(2).
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
506(b).
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
506(b)
is
the
oversecured
creditor
postpetition
right
to
be
paid
interest.
that
is
a
general
statute.
however,
it
would
be
illogical,
i
think,
to
say
that
506(b)
could
not
be
used
as
justification
for
payment
over
a
period
of
5
years
to
an
oversecured
creditor.
but
i
feel
that
the
explicit
language
of
congress
in
1325(b)(2)
provides
for
time
value
interest.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
i
adopt
the
government's
interpretation
that
506(b)...
(b)(2)
provides
only
for
interest
postpetition.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
1325(b)(2)
is
found
at
page
a-5
of
the
petitioners'
petition
for
certiorari,
set
out
in
full
there
on
page
a-5.
it
says
that
the...
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b),
the
court
shall
confirm
a
plan
if,
(a),
the
holder
of
such
claim
has
accepted
the
plan.
"
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
a-5
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
(ii)
under...
under
(b)
on
a-5,
where
it
starts
"the
value".
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
"as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
plan,
of
property
to
be
distributed
under
the
plan
on
account
of
such
claim
is
not
less
than
the
allowed
amount
of
such
claim.
"
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
(a)(b)(ii).
that
is
also
synonymous
with
1129
under
chapter
11
plans,
which
in
the
legislative
history
congress
said
is
to
be
identical
to
the
chapter
13
provision.
the
difference
being,
however,
that
in
a
chapter
11
plan,
a
creditor
can
propose
a
plan.
however,
in
a
chapter
13
plan
a
creditor
cannot
propose
a
plan,
and
1322(b)(2)
is
meant
to
protect
the
creditor.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
well,
actually,
since
i'm
an
oversecured
creditor.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
i'm
entitled
to
that
minimal
amount
of
interest
from
the
time
the
petition
is
filed
until
the
plan
is
confirmed,
which
is
normally
a
month
or
two.
if
there
are
amendments,
it
might
run
as
far
as
3
months.
that's
not
much
money.
the
big
money
is
where
i'm
forced
to
make
a
loan
to
the
debtor
for
5
years,
and
so
that's
the
basis
of
which
we
are
asking
for
interest.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
there's
no
question
as
to
that.
and,
again,
we
get
another
question
begging,
what
if
i'm
an
undersecured
creditor?
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
i
think
under
1325,
an
undersecured
creditor
is
likewise
entitled
to
interest,
even
though...
and,
see,
it's
not
even
mentioned
whether
you're
an
oversecured
creditor
or
an
undersecured
creditor
in
1325.
now--
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
--oh,
yes.
under
state
law
i
would
get
treasury
plus
4
points.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
on
the
arrearage.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
right.
it's
not
in
the
contract,
but
in
oklahoma,
if
you
apply
state
law...
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that
trap.
i
don't
think
that
state
law
interest
would
apply
in
this
case,
nor
do
i
think
this
court
should
apply
a
rule
of
state
law
application
of
interest.
the
reason
why
is
because
it
would
encourage
forum
shopping,
it
would
cause
windfalls.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
well,
if
you
move
out
of
state
and
you
get
another
venue
and
they
don't
object--
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
--principal
residence
of
the
debtor.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
it's
an
allowed
claim.
yes,
sir,
it's
an
allowed
claim.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
that
was
not
handled
in
the
lower
court.
i
kick
myself
that
we
didn't
raise
this
question--
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
--because
i
hate
to
come
back
on
what
interest
rate.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
is
it
going
to
be
state
law,
is
it
going
to
be
federal
law?
i
think
it
should
be
federal
law.
if
it's
federal
law,
then
i
think
there
should
either
be
one
of
two
rules.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
quiet.
it's
silent.
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
commonly,
it's
market
rate,
8
percent.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes.
but,
i'm
again...
i
want
to
urge
in
the
5
minutes
i
have,
i
want
to
urge
that
there's
nothing
cutting
across
any
state
interest
by
applying
a
federal
rule
of
interest
in
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
--where
congress
has
been
silent.
i
ask
that
there
be
a
federal
rule
and
that
the
federal
court
here
apply
a
uniform
interest
rate
under
the
bankrupt...
under
the
constitutional
uniformity.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes,
i
do.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
no.
the
rationale
is
a
little
shady
under
506(b).
i'm
sorry,
but
i'm
here
under
1325.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes,
because
that's
part
of
my,
quote,
allowed
claim.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
that's
something
that
really
should
be
hammered
across,
is
that
when
i
file
a
claim,
i
file
a
claim
for
interest,
i
file
a
claim
for
$35,000
due
on
the
mortgage,
then
if...
i
file
a
claim
also
for
the
arrearages,
which
can
be
interest,
taxes
advanced,
insurance
advanced,
court
costs,
and
attorney
fees.
and
interest
is
allowed
on
attorney
fees
under
federal
law.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
i
don't
want
to
say
that,
justice
white.
[laughter]
i
want
to
say
that
you
would
pick
another,
more
rational
ground
to
establish
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
no,
sir,
no.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yes,
i
would.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
well,
but
under
506(b)...
and
i
don't
want
to
trample
on
justice
o'connor's
comma.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
but
in
506(b)
they
all
go
together.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
interest
is
an
unqualified
right.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
well,
in
ron
pair
the
comma
was
not
ignored,
no.
it
set
it
off
as
a
separate
clause
and
says
"and
if
the
agreement
so
provides.
"
attorney
fees
and
so
on.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
no,
i
got
interest
on
all
of
that
and
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
interest
under
it,
and
would
be
under
the
federal
rule.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
no,
but
in
deciding
this
case,
i
believe
that
the
court
should
grab
that
one
feature,
because
it's
a
very
integral
part
of
the
question.
it
doesn't
give
a
full
and
complete
disposition
of
the
case
unless
you
say
we're
going
to
apply
a
federal
rule
of
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
yeah,
the
federal
rule
of
interest,
and
you're
going
to
apply
a
uniform
rate
of
interest,
and
it
will
either
be,
one,
contract
rate,
market
rate...
the
contract
rate
is,
after
all,
what
the
parties
bargain
for...
or
you
will
apply
a
treasury
bill
rate
over--
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
--no,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
i'm
doing
it
under
the
equity
powers
of
this
court,
that
in
order
to
decide
a
case
you
will
decide
it
completely.
because
it
is
leaving
a
very
rough
ground
behind.
in
other
words,
when
we
go
back--
mr.
lawrence
a.g.
johnson
--but
the
bankruptcy
code
is
silent
as
to
the
rate.
the
bankruptcy
code
is
silent
as
to
whether
state
law
will
apply
or
federal
law
will
apply
as
to
interest.
