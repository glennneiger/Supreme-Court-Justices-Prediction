justice
scalia
but
the
plan
says
how...
how
far
deferred
it's
going
to
be,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
the
code
doesn't...
doesn't
provide
for
an
automatic
answer.
justice
scalia
so
it's
either
done
by
the
plan
or
it's
not
done.
justice
scalia
well
you
can
say
that
about
any
treatment
of
anything
under
the
plan.
the
code
authorizes
a
plan
to...
to
adjust
any
indebtedness,
right?
justice
scalia
so,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
this
is
any
different
from
any
other
indebtedness
under
it,
as
far
as
that
goes.
justice
scalia
can
i
ask...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
crucial
language
in
this
is...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
crucial
language
is
whether...
what
we're
really
arguing
about
is
whether
this
is
an
allowed
secured
claim
provided
for
by
the
plan,
right?
justice
scalia
you
don't.
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you
think
the
crucial
language
is?
justice
scalia
well,
it...
i'm...
let
me
begin
with
1325,
anyway.
1325
provides
that
you
give
current
value,
and
you
make
sure
that
current
value
isn't
diminished
as
for
anything...
as
for
any...
any
distribution
on
account
of
the
claim
covered
by
the
plan,
distributed
under
the
plan.
justice
scalia
and
you
were
arguing,
at
least
at
one
point
in
your...
in
your
brief,
that
this
is
not
a
claim
provided
for
by
the
plan.
you're
saying
it's
a
claim
that
exists
on
its
own
as
a
simple
contractual
obligation
that's
been
preserved,
right?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--if
that
is
so,
how
do
you
explain
the
language
of
1328,
which
says
that
"the
court
shall
grant
the
debtor
a
discharge
of
all
debts
provided
for
by
the
plan.
"
okay,
"except
any
debt
provided
for
under
1322(b)(5).
"
so
1328
refers
to
1322(b)(5)
as
a
debt
"provided
for
by
the
plan".
justice
scalia
well,
i
do.
it
seems
to
me
central
to
the...
to
the
case.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
some
interpretation
of
that
language,
of
1328,
that
is
consistent
with
your
argument
here?
justice
scalia
so
then
you
feel
that
1325
may
be
inconsistent
with
that
part
of
1328.
justice
scalia
and
would
you
say
that
if
they
adopted
such
a
provision
and
such
a
provision
provided
for
10
percent
interest,
and
the
legal
rate
of
interest
that
would
otherwise
apply
under
the
bankruptcy
code
was
less
than
that,
that
they'd
get
the
higher
amount
of
interest?
justice
scalia
in
bankruptcy?
justice
scalia
uh-hum.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
(b)(5)
only
has
that
application,
or
506(b)
only
has
that
application.
justice
scalia
(b)
only
has
that
application.
justice
scalia
when
you
concluded
that,
you
said
so
(b)(5)
only
has
that
application,
and
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
1322(b)(5).
justice
scalia
i
think...
fees
and
expenses,
was
there
interest
allowed
on
those
too?
justice
scalia
that's
part
of
your
allowed.
justice
scalia
well,
you
say...
well,
never
mind.
justice
scalia
you
seem
to
say
that
on
page
15.
you
say,
"and
thus
the
interest
provided
under
section
506(b)
must
be
paid
to
compensate
creditors
for
the
delay
occasioned
by
a
cure
permitted--
"
justice
scalia
--that's
not
what
you
say
on
15.
you
say
it
"must
be
paid
to
compensate
creditors
for
the
delay
occasioned
by
a
cure
permitted
by
1322(b)(5).
"
that's
what
you
say
on
15.
you
stick
with
footnote
7,
though,
anyway.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
but
why...
i
don't...
isn't
that
always
the
case?
everything
after
the
comma
will
always...
will
always
bring
you
back
to
before
the
comma.
justice
scalia
but
if
it
does
provide
for
that,
it
is
part
of
the
claim
anyway.
justice
scalia
so
it's
a
strange
provision.
justice
scalia
--mr.
carpenter,
i
had...
i
had
understood
that
the
purpose
of
1322(b)(2)
was
to
give
some
special
status
to
home
mortgages,
to
make
that
an
especially
attractive
investment.
but...
but
what
you
propose
makes
it
an
especially
unattractive
investment.
it's
the
only
one
in
which
you
can
make
a
modification
to
the
plan
and
not
provide
for
present
value,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
why
would
congress
want
to
single
out
home
mortgages
for
that
special
disability?
i
mean
it
makes
it
an
especially
unattractive
investment.
justice
scalia
well,
it
can
be
modified,
but
only
in
one
way,
to
the
advantage...
to
the
advantage
of
the...
of
the
debtor.
justice
scalia
by...
by
extending
the
payments
and
allowing
no
interest
on
those
payments,
whereas
every
other
oversecured
creditor,
you
have
to
allow
interest
on
the
payments.
