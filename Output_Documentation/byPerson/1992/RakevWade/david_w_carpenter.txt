mr.
david
w.
carpenter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
matter
has
just
plainly
missed
the
mark.
they
have
adopted
a
case
of
this
term...
or
this
court,
the
ron
pair
case,
united
states
v.
ron
pair
enterprises
inc.,
which
only
superficially
bears
any
relationship
to
the
facts
framed
here.
but
having
committed
that
mistake,
the
tenth
circuit
has
compounded
that
error
by
misreading
the
ron
pair
decision
so
as
to
require
the
petitioners
to
pay
interest
not
only
on
an
arrearage
in
a
chapter
13
plan,
bankruptcy
plan,
but
also
with
respect
to
fees,
costs,
and
other
charges.
and
that
is
found
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
tenth
circuit
opinion.
the
ron
pair
decision
of
this
court
specifically
holds,
by
reason
of
its
grammatical
construction,
that
interest
is
to
be
paid
only
upon
the
allowed
secured
claim,
and
is
grammatically
separated
from
the
contractually
required
fees,
costs,
and
other
charges.
so
in
any
event,
and
i...
the
brief
of
the
respondent
and
also
the
government
failed
to
rebut
this
point.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed,
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
this
issue.
otherwise,
we
believe
that
the
ron
pair
decision
does
not
even
apply
to
the
facts
framed
in
a
chapter
13
cure
scenario.
first,
the
case
of
ron
pair
dealt
exclusively
with
whether
or
not
there
was
a
distinction
between
a
consensual
versus
a
nonconsensual
lien
on
an
oversecured
claim,
and
if
that
distinction
made
any
difference
with
regard
to
paying
interest
as
required
under
section
506(b)
under
a
chapter
11
plan
of
reorganization.
secondly,
ron
pair
did
not
involve
the
specific
framework
of
chapter
13.
it
is
a
chapter
11
proceeding,
and
there
are
certain
statutory
limitations
in
chapter
13,
specifically
section
1322(b)(2),
that
are
inapplicable
in
every
chapter
11
proceeding.
third,
ron
pair
did
not
involve
a
long-term
debt,
as
that
term
is...
is
not
employed,
but
intended
under
chapter
13.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
justice
white,
as
i
am.
this...
the
statutory
provision,
section
506(b),
requires
that
where
a
claim
is
oversecured
the
allowed
secured
claim
must
be
paid
interest
and
must
also
be
paid
its
contractually
provided
for
fees,
costs,
and
other
charges.
we
feel
that
section
506(b),
however,
does
not
apply
in
the
cure
scenario
found
under
chapter
13,
specifically
section
1322(b)(5).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i'm
sorry.
a
cure
scenario
where
a
debtor
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding
has
fallen
delinquent
in
home
mortgage
payments
and
desires
to
cure
that
arrearage,
or
cure
that
default.
under
section
1322(b)(5),
the
code
provides
that
he
may...
he
or
she
may
do
so,
and
maintain
regular
payments.
that
is
the
upshot
of
1322(b)(5).
that
particular
paragraph
applies
only
to
what
i
have
termed
long-term
debts;
that
is
to
say,
a
debt
whose
normal
maturity
date
would
not
come
to
pass
until
completion
of
all
chapter
13
plan
payments.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
rely
on
1322(b)(2),
yes,
justice
white.
i
also
rely
on
1322(b)(3)
and
(b)(5).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
it
prohibits
plan
modification,
justice
white.
it
does
not
prohibit
code
modification
of
the
home
mortgage.
and
by
home
mortgage
i,
of
course,
refer
to
a...
an
allowed
secured
claim
that
is
secured
solely
by
real
property
which
constitutes
the
debtors
principal
residence.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
justice
white.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the
plan
provides
that
in
order
to
effect
a
cure--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--under
section
1322,
the
cure
must
be
effected
within
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that
is
not
further
defined
in
the
code.
in
practice,
it
is
implied
to
be
not
longer
than
the
length
of
the
chapter
13
plan,
which
could
be
anywhere
from
1
month
to
5
years.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
the...
what
is
set
aside
is
the
right
to
immediately
foreclose
and
accelerate.
this,
however,
is
not
a
plan
modification
as
petitioners
view
it.
it
is
a
modification
that
is
imposed
by
the
bankruptcy
code
itself,
section
1322(b)(5).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i'm
saying
that
if
the
debtors
choose
to
avail
themselves
of
the
cure
provisions
of
paragraph
(b)(5),
that
it
is
the
code
and
not
the
plan
which
constitutes
the
modification.
it
does
have
the...
the
limiting
language,
"notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
1322(b)(2).
"
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the
plan--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--no--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
however,
the
treatment
is
not
initiated
by
the
plan
per
se,
it
is
initiated
by
the
code.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
uh--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--i
do
acknowledge
your
point,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is...
that
is
a
valid
point.
however,
we
feel
that
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
story,
if
you
will.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
do
not
necessarily
acknowledge
that
as
being
a
correct
statement,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
think
that--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--i
think
that
by
virtue
of
effecting
a
cure
under
section
1322(b)(5),
the
debtors
elects
to
maintain
payments,
and
hence
as
to
the
maintained
payments
there
is
a
continuation
of
the
preexisting,
prebankruptcy
contract.
and
therefore
that
contract
is
not
provided
for
by
the
plan.
it
is
only
the
cure
aspect
that
is
dealt
with
inside
the
plan.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
yes,
justice
scalia.
there's
authority
to
that
effect
among
the
circuits.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
however,
it
is
my
position
that
section
1325
is
not
even
invoked
when
a
cure
under
section
1322(b)(5)
is
effected,
because
maintenance
of
the
payments
implies
with
it
necessary
contractual
payment
of
interest
on
the
allowed
secured
claim.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
justice
scalia,
it
does.
and
i
believe
that
that...
i
think
the
congressional
intent
there
is
to...
and
i
don't
want
to
particularly
get
hung
up
on
the
phrase
"provided
for
by
the
plan"--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--my
belief
is
that
congress,
in
section
1328,
indicated
that
where
there
will
be
a...
a
continuation
of
a
long-term
debt
past
the
end
of
the
plan,
it
would
be
inappropriate,
whether
secure
or
unsecured,
to...
to
allow
a
discharge.
i
will...
i
will
concede
that
1328
does
refer
to
provision
by
the
plan
under
1322(b)(5).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
justice...
mr.
chief-justice,
i
do
not.
i
believe
that...
that
the
term
1325,
because
maintenance
of
the
payments
under
1322(b)(5)
will
necessarily
require
maintenance
of
the
existing
prefiling
contractual
rate
of
interest
that
would
be
paid
on...
on
the
allowed
secured
claim.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
to
that
extent
i
do
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
specifically,
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
cure.
cure
is
found
in
various
places
throughout
the
bankruptcy
code.
it
is
found
in
section
365
dealing
with
executory
contracts
and
unexpired
leases.
it
is
also
found
in
section
1124
dealing
with
prepetition
defaults
and
various
types
of
claims
or
interests.
it
is
found
in
two
places
in
section
1322,
one
in
paragraph
(b)(3)
and
one
in
paragraph
(b)(5).
(b)(5),
of
course,
refers
to
debts
that
would
mature
subsequent
to
the
final
payment
under
a
chapter
13
plan,
which
leaves
(b)(3),
a
fortiori,
to
apply,
although
not...
so
limited
by
its
terms,
it
would
not
have
any
meaning
apart
from
relating
only
to
a
short-term
debt,
one
that
would
normally
mature
within
the
scope
of
the
chapter
13
plan.
the
provisions
in
section
365
and
1124
that
deal
with
cure
both
require
the
debtor,
as
a
function
of
cure
under
those
sections,
to
not
only
cure
the
default,
but
to
compensate
the
claimant
for
any
monetary
loss
and
to
assure
future
performance
under
the
cured
default.
that
language
is
conspicuously
absent
from
the
two
provisions
in
section
1322.
there
is
no
requirement
of
compensation,
no
requirement
of
assurance.
there
is
merely
either
the
curing
or
waiving
of
a
default
under
section
1322(b)(3),
or
the
curing
of
the
default
under
(b)(5).
we
feel
that
congress'
intentional
elimination
of
the
compensation
and
assurance
language
found
in
365
and
1124
indicate
clearly
that
the
time
value
money,
which
would
equate
to
the
compensation
factor
in
365
and
1124,
are
specifically
to
be
disregarded
under
cures
either
under
section
1322(b)(3)
or
(b)(5).
there's
additional
language
in
the
section
1322(b)(5)
that
specifically
requires
the
cure
to
be
effected
within
a,
quote,
reasonable
time.
that
is
not,
as
i
indicated,
further
elaborated
in
the
code,
but
is
nonetheless,
i
believe,
congress'
intention
that
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
is,
in
the
best
of
all
possible
circumstances,
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
to
make
a
factual
determination
of
what
should
constitute
a
reasonable
time.
that,
i
believe,
is
consistent
with
the
framework
of
the
bankruptcy
code
in
general
and
harmonizes
all
of
the
apparently
and
superficially
conflicting
sections
of
the
bankruptcy
code
in
chapter
13.
but
since
there
are
various
competing
interests,
the
mortgagee
has
an
interest
and
that
competes
with
the
interests
of
the
debtor.
but
more
importantly,
and
perhaps
more
to
the
point,
the
general
unsecured
creditors
have
a
very
distinct
interest
in
whether
or
not
interest
must
be
paid
in
curing
arrearages.
the
general
unsecured
creditors
essentially
get
whatever's
left
over
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
13
plan
unless
the
chapter
13
debtor
is
so
well
heeled
that
he
may
fully
fund
the
plan,
notwithstanding
what
objections
might
be
raised,
and
pay
unsecured
creditors
100
percent
of
their
face
amount
of
their
claims.
in
those
fairly
rare
instances...
i
do
note,
by
the
way,
that
petitioners
yell
are
in
a
100
percent
plan.
but
in
those
fairly
rare
instances,
if
interest
is
required
to
be
paid,
then
that
interest
is
going
to
be
essentially
borne
on
the
backs
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors.
since
they
have
no
vote
in
whether
or
not
a
chapter
13
plan
would
be
confirmed,
i
think
the
interests
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
are
being
preserved
by
the
bankruptcy
court
in
allowing
a
cure
without
interest.
i
think
that
section
506(b)
does
not
apply
to
the
case
before
the
court
today,
for
the
reason
that
i
believe
section
506(b)
is
a
general
statute,
one
of
general
application.
in
fact,
that
has
been
a
determination
found
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
case
of
wilson
v.
commonwealth
mortgage
corporation,
found
at
895
federal
reporter,
second
series,
at
page
128.
chapter
5,
along
with
chapters
1
and
2,
tend
to,
if
you
will,
float
over
the
entire
administration
of
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
to
provide
a
general
administrative
guidance,
and
is
to
give
way
where
there
are
specific
instances
of
apparent
conflict
between
chapter
5
and,
in
this
case,
chapter
13.
in
any
event,
i
would
note
that
there
is
no
language
in
section
506
which
would
tend
to
determine
anything
relative
to
what
is
necessary
under
a
cure.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the...
of
course,
the
position
of
the
petitioners
is
supported
by
the
majority
of
the
circuits
that
have
ruled
on
this
issue,
as
well
as
the
leading
treatise
in
the
bankruptcy
field,
that
of
collier's,
and,
to
the
view
of
the
petitioners,
is
the
only
way
to
harmonize
all
of
the
various
competing
sections
in
chapter
13.
we
feel
that
the
respondent's
view
cannot
harmonize
both
506(b)
and
1325
with
the
nonmodification
rule
of
section
1322(b)(2).
we
also
feel
that
the
respondent
is
seeking
here
to
expand
his
contractual
rights
in
a
way
that
is
not
authorized
under
section
1322(b)(2).
the
respondent's
own
contract
is
a
form
drawn
up
by
his
assignor
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
relative
rights
of
the
parties
at
its
inception.
it
specifically
dealt
with
the
issue
of
default
and
delinquency
by
providing
for
late
payment
penalties.
we
feel
that
this
amounts
to
a
private
remedy,
and
is...
if
section
506(b)
does
apply,
is
the
functional
equivalent
to
the
interest
requirement
under
section
506(b).
we
have
a
very
strong
feeling
that
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
has
skewed
inappropriately
the
very
delicate
balance
struck
by
congress
in
dealing
with
the
competing
interests
that
i've
previously
mentioned.
the
home
mortgage
contract,
by
and
large
in
this
country,
is
a
contract
of
adhesion.
debtors,
mortgagors,
have
virtually
no
power
to
effect
change
in
the
language
drawn
up
by
the
mortgagee
on
its
form
contract.
the
mortgagee
has
the
ability
to
protect
itself
from
the
application
of
section
1322(b)(2)
by
merely
requiring
that
delinquent
installments
shall
continue
to
bear
interest
at
a
specified
rate
or
at
the
contract
rate,
until
paid.
that
is
not
what
was
done.
what
was
done
is
that
the
mortgagee
determined
that
a
late
payment
should
bear
with
it
a
penalty
of
either
$5
or
5
percent
of
the
penalty,
whichever
payment
was
less.
we
also
feel
that
the
opinion
of
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
it
would
by
reason
of
section
1322(b)(2).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
and
i
believe
the...
the
courts
that
have
followed
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
have
determined
that
where
the
contract
of
the
parties
calls
for
interest,
interest
must
be
paid
on
those
arrearages.
where
the
contract
is
silent,
it
should
stay
silent.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
and
virtually
every
creditor
is
denied
something
in
the
bankruptcy
scenario.
in
the
case
of
the
home
mortgage,
it
is
the
right
to
accelerate
and
foreclose.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
interest
should
be
paid.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
not
to
the
other
provision.
that
would
require
congressional
enactment
to
overrule,
or
to
repeal,
rather,
section
1322(b)(5).
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
defer
my
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
interest
on
an
arrearage
of
a
home
mortgage
in
the
early
years
of
that
mortgage
is
essentially
interest
on
interest.
very
little
of
the
monthly
payment
made
to
a
mortgagee
constitutes
a
reduction
of
principal
or
an
allocation
to
an
escrow
for
insurance
or
taxes,
where
those
are
escrowed
in
a
monthly
mortgage
payment.
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
by
respondent
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
giving
rise
to
the
current
status
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
i
assert
that
there
are
no
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
present
before
this
court
today
that
are
unambiguous...
or,
excuse
me,
that
are
ambiguous,
and
therefore
resort
to
legislative
history
is
without
merit
and
should
not
be
indulged
in
by
the
court,
and
this
court
has
so
determined
on
several
occasions.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
justice
stevens,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
the
legislative
history,
however,
is
not
particularly
instructive
or
enlightening
in
light
of
the
actual
language
used
by
congress
in
enacting
the
various
chapters...
or
sections
of
the
bankruptcy
code
with
which
we're
dealing
today.
other
than
deacceleration
of
a
home
mortgage
and
the
right
to
foreclose
pending
continuation
or
maintenance
of
payments
under
a
chapter
13
plan,
there
is
no
modification
of
a
home
mortgage,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
interaction
of
sections
1322(b)(2)
and
(b)(5).
there
just
may
not
be
any
modifications
of
the
home
mortgage
except
to
allow
a
cure.
therefore,
the
respondent's
argument
with
respect
to
what
else
can
be
modified
in
his
mortgage,
and
especially
raising
the
specter
of
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
nobelman
which
is
currently
pending
before
this
court,
are
irrelevant
to
the
issues
today.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--i
disagree,
justice
scalia,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
disagree
for
this
reason.
section
1322(b)(5)
specifically
limits
the
application
of
1322(b)(2).
it
permits
cure
within
a
reasonable
time,
and
that
is
what
i
believe
congress
intended
for
the
bankruptcy
courts
on
a
specific
case-by-case
basis,
fact-specific
case,
to
determine.
in
certain
cases
it
would
be
36,
perhaps
even
as
many
as
60
months,
a
5-year
plan.
in
certain
cases
it
might
only
be
10
months.
in
fact,
if
there's
not
a
very
extensive
arrearage,
the...
i
believe
the
bankruptcy
rules,
as
they
relate
to
distributions
by
a
chapter
13
trustee,
prohibit
payments
of
less
than
$15.
and
so
if
there's
a
$150
arrearage
that
is
due
as
of
the
date
of
filing
of
the
petition,
it
could
not
be
stretched
out
past
6
months,
unless
there's
an
exorbitant
amount
of
interest
that
this
court
would
ultimately
determine
is
appropriate.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
only
upon
application
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
mr.
justice
stevens,
relating
to
relief
from
the
automatic
stay
under
section
362.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
and--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--i
don't--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--he
would
have
the
right,
yes,
justice--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
justice
stevens.
he
would
have
to
file
an
application
for
relief
from
the
automatic
stay.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
not
a
complete
and
total
surrender
for
all
purposes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
postponement
pending
maintenance
of
the
payments
under
section
(b)(5),
1322(b)(5),
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
it
unattractive.
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
before
the
court,
at
any
of
the
levels
bringing
this
matter
to
a
head
today,
that
would
reflect
that
position.
section
1322(b)(2)
is
a
two-edged
sword,
and
that's
exactly
what
judge
ginsberg,
in
the
in
re
stamper
case
cited
in
our
authorities,
held.
that
there
is...
there
is
no
right
to
modify
either
in
favor
of
the
creditor
or
in
a
manner
detrimental
to
the
creditor.
it
just
cannot
be
modified
other
than
the
interplay
of
section
1322(b)(5).
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
think--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
difference
here
is
that
i
believe
congress
has
struck
a
very
delicate
balance
among
the
various
competing
interests,
as
i
said.
what
drives
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy,
that
it
does
not...
does
not
have
sufficient
revenues
to
pay
all
creditors
in
full,
are
the
claims
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors.
to
the
extent
that
they
must
bear
the
burden
of
paying
the
interest...
because
it
is
not
money
that
goes
back
to
the
debtor
under
any
scenario.
it
is
paid
to
the
general
unsecured
creditors,
and
where
they
can
only
receive
less
than
100
percent
of
their
allowed
claims,
then
they
pay
that
interest.
congress
has
struck
this
delicate
balance
among
all
the
competing
interests.
the
amount
of
debt--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
singled
out
for
especially
beneficial
treatment
under
section
1322(b)(2)
because
under
a
chapter
13
plan
a
ny
claim
of
any
sort,
other
than
a
home
mortgage,
may
be
modified,
and
that
is
usually
to
the...
to
the
detriment
of
the
creditor.
and
so
they
are
protected
to
the
extent
that
their
underlying
claim
cannot
be
modified
other
than
the...
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
deacceleration
and
the...
and
the
holding
off
of
foreclosure,
yes,
sir.
again,
i
would...
i
would
remind
the
court
that
it
is
within
the
strict
power
of
mortgagees
generally,
and
the
respondent
here
specifically,
to
modify
their
underlying
documents.
there
is
no
question
that...
the
well
reasoned
circuit
opinions
and
judge
ginsberg
opinion
specifically
state
that
where
the
contract
would
provide
for
interest
on
an
arrearage,
that
that
must
be
honored
under
a
cure
of...
under
section
1322(b)(5),
because
of
its
interplay
with
(b)(2).
but
where
a
creditor,
for
whatever
reason,
elects
not
to,
you
know,
place
that
particular
provision
in
his
contract,
he
is
stuck
with
his
bargain.
what
is
happening
today
is
the
respondent
is
asking
for
this
court
to
expand
his
contractual
rights,
and
that
is
what
congress
has
closed
the
door
on.
congress
has
said
you
may
not
expand
the
rights
of
the
home
mortgage.
you
may
not
contract
them,
but
you
may
not
expand
them.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that
is...
that
statement
was
made,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
in
actuality
the...
the
interest
that
was
provided...
that
was
mentioned,
the
treasury
rate
plus
4
points,
is
the
state
judgment
rate,
not
a
default
rate.
it
is...
there
is
no
judgment
rate,
or
there's
no
interest
rate
that
would
be
provided
prior
to
a
state
court
judgment.
only
upon
completion
of
a
foreclosure
proceeding,
pending
the
sheriff's
sale
at
a
foreclosure,
would
there
be
any
postjudgment
t-bill
plus
or
treasury
rate
plus
4.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
for
the
brief
period
of
time
until
such
time
as
the
sheriff
was
able
to
appraise,
sell--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
property
and
the
court
confirmed
it,
under
oklahoma
procedure.
that's
a
fairly
brief
period
of
time.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
under
that
scenario,
yes.
that
is,
however,
fairly
late
in
the
foreclosure
procedures.
we
are
asking
that
this
court
specifically
overturn,
reverse
the
tenth
circuit.
their
reliance
upon
section
506(b)
is
not
applicable.
they
even
misread
this
court's
opinion
in
ron
pair
in
requiring
interest
on
costs,
fees,
and
other
charges,
and
specifically
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it
is
not
applicable
because,
your
honor--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--no,
sir,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be
applicable
even--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
would
not,
for
the
simple
reason
that
section
1322(b)(2)
prohibits
that
modification
and
a
maintenance
of
payments
under
1322(b)(5)
maintains
the
existing
payment
structure
that
existed
prefiling,
repetition,
and
does
not
extend
to...
and
does
not
even
invoke
section
1325.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
