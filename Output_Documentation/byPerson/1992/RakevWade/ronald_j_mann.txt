mr.
ronald
j.
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
considers
the
availability
of
interest
for
oversecured
creditors
in
chapter
13
bankruptcy
cases.
in
our
view,
the
problem
is
resolved
by
the
precise
wording
of
three
related
statutory
provisions,
sections
506(b),
1322(b)(5),
and
1325(a)(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
i'd
like
to
look
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
then
address
a
number
of
points
raised
by
petitioner.
the
first
part
of
the
question
is
whether
interest
is
available,
what
i'll
call
preconfirmation
interest,
from
the
date
the
petition
is
filed
until
the
effective
date
of
the
plan.
in
our
view,
that's
governed
by
section
506(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
i
understand
from
justice
scalia
there
may
have
been
some
ambiguity
in
our
brief,
but
i
don't
think
that
there's...
i
did
not
mean
anything
in
our
brief
to
suggest
that
that
provision
would
apply
after
the
date
of
confirmation.
i'm
somewhat
puzzled
as
to
what
in
my
brief
might
suggest
that
view,
but
that's
certainly
not
our
view.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
in
our
view,
section--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--occasioned
by
the
pendency
of
the
bankruptcy
case,
by
which
i
refer
to
the
pendency--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--i
stick
with
footnote
7
and
i
meant
the
portion--
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
--that
sentence
referred
to
the
portion
of
the
cure
that
occurs
before
the
plan
is
confirmed.
1325
covers
the
portion
after
the
plan.
but
looking
at
the
preconfirmation
interest,
the
relevant
statute
is
section
506(b),
and
this
is
on
page
1a
of
our
appendix.
the
first
operative
clause
of
that
statute
provides
that
there
shall
be
allowed
to
the
holder
of
an
oversecured
claim
interest
on
such
claim;
it
states
that
without
qualification.
as
the
court
explained
in
ron
pair,
this
section
should
be
read
as
having
two
different
clauses.
the
first
provides
for
interest
in
all
cases
and
the
second
clause,
after
the
comma,
provides
for
reasonable
fees,
costs,
and
charges,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
they're
provided
for
under
the
agreement
under
which
the
claim
arose.
now,
this
case
involves
a
claim
for
interest.
therefore,
the
bankruptcy
courts
should
have
allowed
the
claim
for
interest
without
regard
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement
under
which
the
claim
arose.
now,
there's
been
some
discussion
as
to
how
that
works
with
respect
to
fees,
costs,
and
other
charges.
if
there
was
an
allowed
secured
claim
for
something
that
would
be
a
fees,
costs,
or
other
charges
provided
for
under
the
agreement,
section
506(b)
would
allow
interest
on
that
claim,
because
it
provides
for
interest
on
your
allowed
secured
claim.
you
would
look
to
the
agreement
and
determine
that
he
might
have
an
allowed
secured
claim,
for
example,
if
he
had
been
required
to
advance
taxes
on
the
real
property.
and
then
under
506(b)
he
would
be
entitled
to
interest
if
he
was
oversecured
and
had
an
allowed
secured
claim
for
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
the
question
of
the
part
after
the
comma
is
that
if
the
agreement
does
not
provide
that
you're
entitled,
for
example,
to
collect
compensation
from
a
debtor
for
a
certain
type
of
fee,
for
example
title
searches.
if
under
state
law,
under
their
mortgage
they
have
not
asked
to
be
compensated
for
that,
federal
law
does
not
grant
them
a
right
to
that.
the
only
way
that
they
could
collect
compensation
for
attorney
fees,
insurance
advances,
advances
to
pay
taxes,
is
if
the
agreement
under
which
the
claim
arose
provides
for
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
it
is
part
of
their
allowed
secured
claim.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
it
is
a
strange
provision,
and
i
think
the
court's
opinion
in
ron
pair
reflected
that.
turning
to
the
availability
of
interest
for
the
period
after
the
plan,
which
as
petitioner
and
respondent
both
agree,
is
really
the
important
monetary
aspect
of
the
case.
we
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
this
really
turns
on
the
language
of
section
1325(a)(5),
and
that's
at
page
2a
of
our
appendix.
and
what
it
says
is
"with
respect
to
each
allowed
secured
claim
provided
for
by
the
plan.
"
the
debt...
the
creditor
is
entitled
to
present
value
payments.
in
this
case,
it's
acknowledged
that
the
claim
is
an
allowed
secured
claim,
and
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
that
the
claim
was
provided
for
by
the
plan.
the
plans
are
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
they
state
that
the
arrearages
will
be
paid
out
over
specified
monthly
periods
and
stated
monthly
installments.
under
any
natural
reading
of
the
phrase
1325(a)(5).
i'd
like
to
address
two
other
points
that
have
come
up.
the
first
one
is
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
that
in
other
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
specifically
sections
1124
and
365,
congress
expressly
provided
for
compensation
for
delay,
but
somehow
in
this
case
the
statute
is
any
less
clear.
the
argument
is
made
at
some
length
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
support
of
petitioners
that
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
it
looks
solely
to
section
1322(b)(5).
the
place
where
congress
provides
for
compensation
for
delay
in
this
context
is
1325(a)(5),
and
as
i've
mentioned,
this
claim
is
clearly
covered
by
that
section,
and
it
just
as
clearly
provides
for
compensation
for
delay
as
any
of
the
other
provisions.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
there
are
no
provisions
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
discuss
the
topic
of
exactly
what
the
rate
of
interest
should
be.
and
i...
i
do
agree
with
respondent
that
it
is
quite
an
important
question.
it
also
seems
quite
clearly
not
to
be
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
lower
courts
are
struggling
with
it,
and
there
are
quite
a
number
of
approaches
that
could
be
taken.
but
i
do
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
under
any
reading
of
the
statute
after
ron
pair,
there
are
clearly
some
cases
in
which
interest
is
going
to
be
paid
under
the
bankruptcy
code
to
oversecured
creditors,
and
the
statute
simply
does
not
state
what
the
interest
rate
is.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
if
ron
pair
had
been
decided
the
other
way,
that
would
deal
with
the
problem
for
pre...
preconfirmation.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
but
it
seems
quite
clear...
i
think
you
would
agree
that
under
section
1325(a)(5),
somebody
is
going
to
be
receiving
compensation
for
delay
under
that
provision.
the
opinion
in
inwood
of
timbers...
timbers
of
inwood
forest
strongly
suggests
that's
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
and
i
think
all
the
people
that
have
looked
at
that
provision
understand
that
it
provides
compensation
for
delay.
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
claim
at
issue
here
is
covered.
and
finally,
one
thing
i
would
like
to...
to
add
to
emphasize
the
reasons
why
it
makes
sense
for
there
to
be
interest
created
by
these
various
provisions,
we
have
to
remember
that
section
502(b)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
disallows
all
claims
for
interest
after
the
petition
has
been
filed.
so
the
availability
of
interest
before
the
petition
under
the
contract
of
the
parties
is
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court
here,
because
the
code
has
expressly
disallowed
those
claims.
so
the
only
way
that
a
creditor,
in
our
view,
would
be
entitled
to
interest
after
the
bankruptcy
petition
has
been
filed
is
if
he
can
identify
a
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
entitles
him
to
compensation
for
delay.
it's
a
uniform
bankruptcy
law
and
congress
has
enacted
uniform
provisions
to
compensate
people
for
delay
during
the
pendency
of
bankruptcy
proceedings.
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
it's
section
502(b)(2).
mr.
ronald
j.
mann
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
