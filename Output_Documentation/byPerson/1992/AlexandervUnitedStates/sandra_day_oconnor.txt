mr.
weston,
would
you
be
making
any
objection
if
what
had
been
done
was
simply
to
require
the
sale
or
disposition
of
all
the
presumptively
protected
materials
and
to
turn
the
proceeds
over
to
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
you
would
be
making--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
same
first
amendment
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
it
doesn't
take
title
to
the
materials.
it
instructs
the...
your
client
to
dispose
of
it
and
turn
the
money
over
to
the
government.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
goodness
sake.
suppose
the
government
decided
because
of
the
rico
violations
to
seek
a
prison
sentence
of
this
person.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
he
could
be
imprisoned
for
a
criminal
violation
of
rico.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
might
discourage
his
business
activities
for
a
while.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
you
assume
that
the
business
could
continue
to
be
operated
while
the
person
is
in
prison?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
offense
were
the
failure
to
pay
taxes,
as
was
also
alleged
here
i
guess?
can
the
government
seize
all
the
inventory
and
dispose
of
it
for
the
failure
to
pay
the
taxes
without
invoking
the
concerns
of
a
prior
restraint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
you
might
make
an
eighth
amendment
argument
somewhere
along
the
line
in
response
to
these
inquiries.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
us
the
extent
of
the
forfeiture
or
what
was
taken?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
general
starr,
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
a
substantial
amount
of
the
inventory
turned
out
to
be
gideon's
bibles?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
concern
that
would
trigger
even
so
much
as
an
o'brien
test
to
the
application--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
would
the
government
have
burned
the
assets
if
it
had
turned
out
they
were
gideon's
bibles
instead
of
erotica?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
does
that
mean
it's
somehow
content
based?
