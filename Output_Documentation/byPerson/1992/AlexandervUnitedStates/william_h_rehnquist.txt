we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-1526,
ferris
j.
alexander
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
weston,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is...
what...
which
of
our
cases
do
you
rely
on,
mr.
weston,
for
the
proposition
that
when
obscenity
is
charged,
it
is
presumed
that
it
is
not
obscene?
i
take
it
that's
what
you're
saying.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
just
a
burden
of
proof
proposition?
you're
saying
that
anyone
is...
if
it's
a
criminal
prosecution,
you're
presumed
innocent
until
you're
found
guilty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
that
established
that
you
can't
seize
it
under
those
conditions.
i
don't
think
it
established
the
proposition
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weston.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
actual
correct
comparison?
you
say
seven
items
were
unprotected,
and
then
hundreds
of
thousands
were
not
determined.
but
wasn't
there
more
than
one
copy
of
each
of
those
seven
items?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
record
of
the
trial...
i
mean,
because
your...
when
you
say
hundreds
of
thousands,
you're
talking
about--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--hundreds
of
thousands
of
different
titles.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
transcript
or
record
that
you
can
refer
to
that
establishes
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
someone
got
up
and
testified
that
this...
there
were
scores
of
thousands
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did...
i'm
asking
did
someone--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weston.
general
starr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
just
tell
us
about
the
record,
rather
than
share
it
with
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
