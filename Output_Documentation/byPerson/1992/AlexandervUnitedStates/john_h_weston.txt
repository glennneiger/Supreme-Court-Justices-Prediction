mr.
john
h.
weston
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
designed
rico
to
eliminate
any
business
which
has
committed
two
or
more
predicate
rico
offenses.
such
a
business
then
becomes
illegal
and
therefore
forfeitable.
under
the
first
amendment,
the
presumption
is
that
no
matter
how
many
speech
violations
a
business
may
commit,
it
retains
its
protected
status
because
all
unlitigated
materials
are
presumed
to
be
constitutionally
protected.
this
case
then
presents
the
collision
between
rico
and
the
first
amendment
made
inevitable
by
the
1984
congressional
amendment
adding
obscenity
to
the
predicate
list
of
rico
offenses.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
mere
fact
of
an
accusation,
mr.
chief...
if
i
understand
the
court's
question,
the
mere
fact
of
an
accusation
does
not
serve
to
deprive
the
material
that
is
being
challenged
of
its
protected
status
until
such
time
as
a
court
ultimately
and
finally
determines
that
it
is
not
obscene.
that
is
certainly
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
with
the...
with
respect
to
the
materials
alleged
to
be
obscene,
a
host
of
cases,
including
all
of
the
so-called
search
and
seizure
cases,
marcus
and
quantity
of
books,
fort
wayne
books,
and
a
host
of
others,
have
all
stood
for
the
proposition
that
even
where
material
is
being
accused
by
government
of
being
obscene
until
such
time
as
it
is
finally
determined
to
be
obscene,
it
may
not
be
removed
from
the
public
totally
because
to
do
so
would
constitute
a
total
prior
restraint.
and,
in
fact,
in
heller,
this
court
went
so
far
in
1973
as
to
note
that
where
a
single
motion
picture
film
was
available
to
an
exhibitor
seized
by
government
as
part
of
an
obscenity
prosecution,
it
was
the
duty
of
government
to
make
at
least
a
copy
of
that
film
available
or
to
permit
the
defendant
to
have
a
copy
of
the
film
so
that
the
film
might
continue
to
be
exhibited
until
such
time
as
it
was
ultimately
determined
to
be
obscene.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
with
all
respect,
i
see
no
difference
with
respect
to
that,
your
honor,
that
if
the
material
is
presumed
to
be
protected
until
it
is
ultimately
deprived
judicially
of
its
protected
status,
under
that
circumstance,
it
retains
the
presumption
of
protectedness
and
simply
may
not
be
removed.
our
point,
however,
is
with
respect
to
this
case,
that
other
than
the
seven
items
determined
to
be
obscene
by
the
jury
in
this
case,
all
of
the
other
material
that
was
seized
and
destroyed
by
the
government
pursuant
to
the
forfeiture
order
was
neither
alleged
nor
proven
to
be
obscene.
and
the
government
is
quite
candid
in
that
the
nature
of
the
material
is
totally
irrelevant.
it
might
have
been
sexually
oriented.
it
might
have
been
erotic,
but
it
just
might
as
well
have
been
a
book
on
how
to
improve
one's
bridge
game
or
build
a
garden
or
a
videotape
dealing
with
bambi
or
aladdin.
the
point
is--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
understanding
that
all
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
books,
magazines,
videotapes,
and
films
seized
from
the...
representing
the
entirety
of
petitioner's
inventory,
without
any
consideration
or
allegation
or
determination
of
the
protected
or
unprotected
status
of
this
material,
was
seized
by
the
government,
carted
away,
and
burned
in
an
incinerator
by
the
federal
marshal.
mr.
john
h.
weston
not...
the
record--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the
record
does
not
reflect
that,
your
honor.
there
were
certainly
some
items--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the
businesses
represented
a
number
of
different
businesses.
they
were
video
stores,
adult
bookstores,
adult
theaters.
mr.
john
h.
weston
much
was
probably
adult
video,
justice
scalia.
the
entirety
of
it
was
not,
but
from
the
first
amendment
perspective,
none
of
this
material...
none
of
the
status...
none
of
the
nature
or
determination
or
character
of
the
seized
material
was
alleged.
and
clearly
under
this
court's
consistent
decisions,
the
first
amendment
requires
judicial
blindness
to
the
nature
of
the
material
that
was
seized
without
any
judicial
focus
whatsoever.
mr.
john
h.
weston
and
the
destruction.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
destruction--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
that
may
be,
and
i
understand
that
perspective,
although
with--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--absolutely,
your
honor,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
government's
destruction
of
the
material,
certainly
at
a
time
of
enormous
national
debt,
when
all
proceeds
from
sale
of
seized
material
would
certainly
go
to
reduce
that
debt,
bespeaks
a
governmental
purpose
to
remove
protected
or
presumptively
protected
materials
from
public
circulation
in
a
way
that
certainly
ought
to
arise
the
interest
in
anti...
in
constitutional
protection
of
both
this
court,
as
well
as
all
of--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--that's
a
very
tricky
and
interesting
question,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
and
frankly,
the
government--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
we
would
make
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
it
is
well
demonstrated
by
what
happened
in
this
case
because
the
moment
the
government
acquires
title
to
the
materials,
it
then
has
the
absolute
determination
as
to
whether
it's
going
to
leave
the
materials
in
public
circulation
or
whether
it
isn't.
mr.
john
h.
weston
in
that
case,
an
aspect
of
the
prior
restraint
doctrine
would
be
satisfied
or
would
be
finessed,
in
a
sense,
in
that
the
public
would
not
necessarily
be
deprived
of
the
materials.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
deal
with
the
right
of
the
disseminator
to
be
able,
in
an
untrammeled
way,
to
continue
to
disseminate
presumptively
protected
materials--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--but
in
that--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no
question,
your
honor,
but
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--discourage,
but
not
necessarily
or
inevitably
or
immediately
in
every
case
eliminate
them.
and
that
really
becomes
the
critical
difference.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
absolutely,
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
today's
modern
business
world.
corporations
conduct
most
businesses.
if
the
president
of
a
corporation
is
placed
in
jail,
the
corporation
continues
to
function,
and
the
business
continues
to
disseminate
presumptively
protected
materials.
sadly,
we
have
seen
all
too
often
in
recent
years
the
presidents
of
major
corporations
incarcerated
and
business
goes
on
in
the
same
way,
although
hopefully
in
a
more
law-abiding
fashion.
mr.
john
h.
weston
oh,
no,
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
h.
weston
he
was
in
prison.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
business
was
totally...
in
fact,
that's
exactly
the
point.
what
the
government
did
here
was
to
completely
eliminate
the
business
and
completely
impose
the
total
prior
restraint
because
the
forfeiture
order--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the
predicate
rico
acts
did
not
include
or
allege
any
prior
conviction.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
there
was
a
prior
conviction.
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
advise,
your
honor,
that
in
1969
or
1970
there
was
an
obscenity
conviction
of
ferris
alexander,
followed
some
years
later
by
an
acquittal,
followed
by
almost
20
years
of
nonprosecution
at
either
the
state
or
the
federal
level,
the
point
being
that
under
this
statute,
which
is
what
is
obviously
before
the
court,
what
was
done
here
was
on
the
basis
solely
of
jury
determination
that
seven
items
were
unprotected.
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
books,
films,
magazines--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
indictment
alleges,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to
some
of
the
materials,
there
were
multiple
copies
received
in
interstate
commerce
by
my
client
in
minnesota.
the
substantive
provisions,
the
1466
counts
which
reference
possession
with
intent
to
sale
or
sale,
do
not
indicate
whether
there
were
more
than
one
copy.
they
are
silent
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
john
h.
weston
different
titles,
your
honor.
different
titles.
mr.
john
h.
weston
hundreds
of
thousands
of
different
titles
is
what
we
believe
to
be
the
case
with
respect
to
videotapes,
films,
magazines,
individual
media
items.
and
i'm
trying
to--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--because
i
think
i
understand
the
court's
question.
i
am
not
saying
a
million
copies
of
three
titles.
we
are
saying
scores
of
thousands,
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands.
perhaps
i
engaged
in
some
hyperbole
for
which
i
apologize,
but
scores
of
thousands,
many
thousands
of
different
titles
were
seized
and
destroyed,
all
of
which
had
neither
been
alleged
to
be
obscene
or
determined
to
be
obscene,
coupled
with--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the...
yes,
there
are...
there
is
a
transcript.
offhand,
i
confess,
mr.--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--let
me
suggest
this
and
perhaps
this
will
assist
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes.
there
was...
the
trial
court
in
its
sentencing
order
noted
it,
and
more
importantly...
and
i'm
sure
the
government
would
not
contest
this,
but
at
the
forfeiture
hearing,
the
government
put
into
evidence
in
an
attempt
and,
we
respectfully
submit,
a
constitutionally
irrelevant
attempt...
but
to
somehow
characterize
what
the
nature
of
the
business
was...
at
least
400
different,
separate
videotapes,
none
of
which
had
been
alleged
to
be
obscene,
and
perhaps
20
or
30
magazines
and
books
and
so
forth.
so,
whether
it
be
100,000
different
titles
or
50,000
or
10,000
different
titles,
the
number
of
different,
unlitigated
titles
was
extraordinary.
but
let
us
not
stop
there
simply
with
the
media
items
because
the
media
items,
large
as
they
were,
whatever
the
number
was,
are
an
extraordinary
minimal
portion
of
the
terrible
prior
restraint
that
was
imposed
here
because
10
media
businesses,
the
equipment
necessary
to
support
the
dissemination,
plus
the
businesses
themselves,
were
taken
over
by
the
government
and
closed
in
a
geometric
fashion,
totally
therefore
eliminating
not
only
the
dissemination
of
all
materials
that
presently
existed
in
the
universe,
but
all
those
which
might
have
been
created
in
the
future
which
could
have
been
disseminated--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
in
arcara
made
very,
very
clear
that
where
the
predicate
conduct
has
no
communicative
quality,
whether
it
be
conduct
with
some...
as
justice
o'connor--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--in
arcara,
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
understand.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
there
would
be
no
per
se
description
of
that
penalty
as
being
a
per
se
prior
restraint.
as
in
the
potential
of
a
high
fine,
the
potential
of
a
jail
sentence
may
or
may
not
in
any
case
constitute
a
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
john
h.
weston
but
we're
not...
in
this
argument,
your
honor,
although
this
court
has
frequently
noted
that
one
of
the
vices
of
a
prior
restraint
is
the
chill...
i
mean,
in
the
pittsburgh
glass
company
case
cited
by
the
government,
that's
exactly
what
the
concept
is.
but
the
point
that
we're
making
primarily
here
is
that
it
is
the
prior
restraint
which
invalidates
in
every
case
the
rico
sanction
as...
the
rico
forfeiture
sanction
as
applied
to
speech
predicates
because
in
every
case,
speech
will
inevitably
and
immediately
be
suppressed,
the
taking
of
the
books,
the
closing
of
the
store,
and
so
forth,
whereas--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--i
see
the
court's
point.
mr.
john
h.
weston
but
the
classical
difference
is,
as
pointed
out
by
near
and
in
a
host
of
subsequent
cases,
there
are
special
rules,
special
concerns,
that
we
have
for
the
first
amendment,
and
the
nature
of
the
injunction
that
was
issued
in
near
would
have
caused
no
problem
if,
as
in
arcara,
the
predicate
or
triggering
conduct
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
speech.
why
was
it
that
this
court...
forgive
the
rhetorical
question,
but
this
court
struggled
and
wrestled
with
the
problem
in
arcara
because,
in
fact,
a
bookstore
was
enjoined.
the
ultimate
conclusion
was
that
where
the
triggering
conduct
either
had
no
speech
at
all
or
had
no
communicative
content
or
no
expressive
conduct
which
was
involved
in
the
sanction,
that
it
simply
was
not
a
prior
restraint.
but
the
obvious
implication,
if
not
explication,
in
both
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
and
in
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
is
that
where
the
triggering
activity
was
either
speech
or
had
communicative
conduct
or,
as
justice
o'connor
noted,
where
a
nonspeech
triggering
statute
had
been
used
as
a
pretext
to
impose
censorship
in
the
interest
of
decency,
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
first
amendment
analysis.
and
in
this
case,
the
only
underlying
conduct,
the
only
triggering
or
predicate
conduct
is
unquestionably
speech.
we
are
out
of
arcara.
we
are
back
in
near.
we
are
back
in
kingsley.
we
are
back
in
marcus
and
quantity,
and
the
first
amendment
analysis
unquestionably
applies.
and
what
is
also
clear
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
no
pretext
for
the
use
of
rico
to
close
down
this
business.
that
was
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
do,
to
eliminate
a
speech
business
because
an...
in
this
case...
an
isolated
number
of
its
titles
had
been
determined
to
be
obscene.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
consider--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--inherently--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no.
forgive
me.
i
was
trying
to
analyze
it.
one
must
look
at
the
nature
of
the
conduct.
fraud
will
not
necessarily
involve
a
speech
situation.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
we'll
have
to
see
what
the
underlying
conduct
is
and
then
to
try
to
examine
it.
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--that--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--where
the
underlying--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--and
we
are
not
asserting
that.
and,
for
example,
there
may
well
be
a
situation
in
a
copyright
infringement
situation
where
a
print
shop
prints
copyright
violational
materials,
where
the
underlying
concern
is
not
the
expression,
as
in
the
fraud
case,
but
what
the
concern
is
is
the
content
of
the
material.
this
statute
is
content
based.
it
is
designed
to
prohibit
and
punish
content,
communicative
content,
of
the
expression
in
a
way
that
either
the
fraud
or
some
other
print
type
thefts
or
property...
interferences
with...
are
not.
in
this
situation,
this
is
speech,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
situation
was
in
near
where
the
contents
of
the
near
publication
were,
although
denominated
a
public
nuisance,
analyzed
and
determined
that
it
was
the
expressive
content
of
the
speech
which
is
what
gave
it...
although
in
and
of
itself,
each
item
of
speech,
each
of
the
nine
issues
of
the
saturday
press
over
the
3
month
period
were
themselves
deemed
to
be
outside
constitutional
protection,
nonetheless,
that
did
not
permit
government
under
any
circumstances
to
be
prospectively
able
to
interfere
with
any
other
kind
of
speech.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
justice
souter,
we
find
that
near
is--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--but
there
was
no
suggestion
in
near
that
mr.
near's
brother
or
his
neighbor
or
someone
who
shared
his
virulent
anti-semitic
passion
couldn't
pick
up
the
publication
and
continue
to
publish
it
in
exactly
the
same
way.
mr.
john
h.
weston
near
was
silent
with
respect
to
it.
mr.
john
h.
weston
but
the...
but
with
all--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the
aspect
of
the
injunction...
merely
because
an
injunction
was
issued
in
the
case
is
certainly,
with
respect,
not
dispositive
of
the
nature
of
what
the
fundamental
near
holding
is.
by
analyzing
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
sanction
in
the
case,
as
we
are
directed
by
near
to
do,
near
was
prevented
from
dealing
with
future
unlitigated
publication.
there
was
a
speech
sanction
that
was
imposed
on
near
from
going
forward
and
disseminating
presumptively
protected
material
in
the
future,
and
the
court
said
no,
you...
that
is
an
impermissible
restraint.
in
keith...
in
citizens
for
a
better
austin
v.
keith,
the
injunction,
although
it
was
an
injunction,
was
even
broader.
the
enjoined
party
could
disseminate
nothing
prospectively.
the
point
is
in
this
case
unlitigated,
undetermined
speech...
presumptively
protected
speech
was
seized
and
destroyed.
an
analogy
to
near's
incapacity
to
be
able
to
go
forward
and
continue
to
publish
what
it
was
that
he
determined
that
he
wanted
to
publish,
so
too
ferris
alexander
was
deprived
the
opportunity
at
the
10
locations
to
be
able
to
disseminate
the
material
which
he,
in
his
editorial
judgment,
chose
to
disseminate.
mr.
john
h.
weston
in
this
case,
your
honor,
of
course...
and
i
say
this
for
the
record,
that
none
of
the
rico
predicate
conduct
or
any
of
the
forfeiture
was
attributable
to
the
tax
case.
but
in
response
to
the
court's
specific
question,
a
civil
judgment
or
a
tax
judgment
may
certainly
be
satisfied
from
whatever
assets
there
are
to
be
satisfied.
but
then,
once
again,
what
triggers
the
sanction
is
not
speech,
and
the
constitution,
just
as
in
arcara,
does
not
say
that
no
speech
business
may
be
subject
to
regulation
in
the
same
way
that
zoning
or
fire
or
safety
and
so
forth
would
be.
and
just
as
in
any
situation
where
a
civil
judgment
might
be
satisfied
from
a
completely
unrelated
situation...
the
owner
of
a
bookstore
hit
a...
in
an
automobile
killed
somebody,
and
certainly
a
civil
judgment
could
be
used
to
satisfy
that.
but
the
point
is
that
from
the
jurisprudence
with
this
court
dealing
with
first
amendment
matters,
unlitigated,
presumptively
protected
speech
may
not
be
interdicted,
destroyed,
taken
out
of
circulation
simply
because
other
media
materials
have
been
determined
to
be
obscene.
and
if--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
h.
weston
absolutely.
for
two
or
more--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
we're
not--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that,
and
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
it
may
well
be...
and
i
would
assume
in
the
circumstance
that
you
suggested...
that
taking
over
the
entirety
of
the
airline
would
certainly
affect
a
prior
restraint
on
the
airline's
ability
to
be
able
to
exhibit
other
unlitigated
motion
picture
films.
but
in
this
context--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--not
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--not
from
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
weston
not
from
the
first
amendment
perspective.
of
course,
the
eighth
amendment
might
well
speak
to
that,
as
we
have
raised
in
our--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--not
only
did
it
not...
not
only
do
we
not
claim
that,
justice
white,
we
affirmatively
represent
and
argue
that
this
judgment
fairly
and
accurately
did
exactly
what
the
rico
statute
directed
trial
judges
to
do
under
the
circumstance.
mr.
john
h.
weston
that
is--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--given--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--given
the
broad
potential
for
forfeiture
under
19...
section
1963,
what
the
court
did
was
commanded
and
directed
by
the
statute.
trial
counsel
ably
argued
that
the
forfeiture
should
be
limited
to
the
obscene
materials
and
the
proceeds
specifically
attributable,
and
under
the
grandiloquent
phrase
from
congress
and
from
judicial
decisions
that
the
purpose
of
rico
is
to
extirpate
the
entire
business
root
and
branch--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--under
settled...
under
existing
law
that
appears
to
be
unquestioned
as
judge
kozinski
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
u.s.
v.
busher
railed
against
in
that
case.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude,
if
i
may,
justice
stevens,
with
the
second
portion
of
the
question
that
you
had
asked
and
that
was
this,
that
in
the
circumstance
where
the
entirety
of
american
airlines
might
be
seized
because
of
the
two
or
three
films.
under
that
circumstance,
we
would
suggest
that
one
would
look
to
the
motive
underlying
the
statute
in
terms
of
its
speech
suppressive
characteristics
that
the
statute
had
been,
whether
it
be,
in
that
circumstance,
to
get
at
speech
or
more
specifically
in
our
own
client's
situation
where
it
had
been
devised
to
get
to
speech.
we
would
suggest
that
the
motive
ought
to
be
examined
even
though
we
well
recognize--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--as
a
constitutional
matter--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--in
terms
of
dealing
with--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
no
question.
mr.
john
h.
weston
thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
as
i
thought
i
had
mentioned
to
justice
white...
or
justice
stevens,
that
there
certainly
would
be
an
eighth
amendment
issue,
whether
it
be
under
the
excessive
fines
provision
or
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
provision,
that
the
confiscation
of
this
business
with
the
notion
of
forfeiture
being
tantamount
to
fines,
as
you
observed
recently,
for
eighth
amendment
purposes
would
constitute
a
grossly
disproportionate
penalty
in
connection
with
the
underlying
offense.
and
this
would
be
whether
the
underlying
offense
was
analyzed
under
the
solem
majority
test
or
under
justice
kennedy's
test
as
articulated
in
harmelin.
i
mean,
this
is
the
most
passive
kind
of
felony.
this
is
the
sort
of
conduct
which
in
osborne
this
court
noted,
in
terms
of
the
obscenity
laws,
were
motivated
by
essentially
a
paternalistic
interest
in
the
subject
matter.
it
is
the
sort
of
offense
which,
again
applying
justice
kennedy's
form
of
analysis,
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
which
generates
parallel
or
ancillary
offenses
and
where
there's
no
national
consensus
and
connection
with
whether
obscenity
or
erotic
materials
should
be
prosecuted.
seven
states
have
no
obscenity
laws,
and
there
is
certainly
minimal
or
relatively
minimal
federal
enforcement
in
terms
of
numbers
of
places
around
the
country
of
this
particular--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--absolutely...
you're,
of
course,
right,
absolutely
right,
justice
white,
that
if
there
had
been...
and
our
argument
is--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--as
in
this
case,
that
the
sole
predicate
offense
was
speech,
that
if
our
client
had
been,
as
part
of
the
predicate
acts,
indicted
for
the
sale
of
cocaine,
our
argument
is
over
because
then--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--absolutely.
we're
constrained
to--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes.
there
may
well
be
an
eighth
amendment
argument
with
respect
to
that,
but
in
terms...
forgive
me,
justice
white.
i
thought
you
were
addressing--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the
first
amendment
question
exclusively.
mr.
john
h.
weston
thank
you.
