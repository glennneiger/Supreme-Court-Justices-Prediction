justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't
claim
that
this
case
is
governed
by
near,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
the
near
case,
any
further
publication
by
the
publisher
of
the
saturday
press
was
enjoined,
and
in
fact,
no
one
else
was
publishing
the
saturday
press;
whereas,
in
this
case,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
aren't...
that
the
publishers
of
the
material
seized
aren't
going
to
go
right
on
publishing
it
and
other
distributors
are
going
to
go
right
on
distributing
it.
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
when
this
individual
gets
out
of
prison,
he
can't
go
right
on
doing
those
things
too.
so,
i
don't
see
how
near
covers
this
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
near
didn't
decide
that
one
way
or
the
other,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument.
i
thought
you
were
analogizing
your
client
to
the
publisher
in
near,
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
he
does
not
bear
a
very
close
analogy
because,
a,
he
is
not
enjoined
from
further
distribution
and,
b,
no
one
else
is
enjoined
from
distribution.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be...
mr.
starr,
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
it
may
be
very
similar,
but
there
is
a
crucial
constitutional
difference
depending
on
whether
there
are
six
pieces
which
are
obscene
and
600,000
which
are
merely
erotic.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
rests
upon
the
identification
of
what
is
assumed
and
probably
correctly
assumed
to
be
simply
erotic
adult
material
with
the
six
which
were
shown
to
be
obscene.
and
that's
your
way
of
sort
of
getting
out
of
the
analogy
that
justice
stevens
is
suggesting,
and
i
don't
see
how
that's
a
legitimate
basis.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
assume
the
identity
of
eroticism
with
obscenity.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
suggesting
that
if
there
weren't
the
evidence
of
the
hidden
assets
and
the
tax
offenses
and
so
on,
that
the
result
under
the...
under
rico
might
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
you're
saying
if
the
government
did,
in
fact,
bring
these
rico
forfeiture
proceedings
only
against
sellers
of
pornography,
that
you
would,
indeed,
have
a
problem
of
content
based
suppression.
