mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
where
we
left
off
in
this
discussion.
as
i
see
it,
until
the
very
end
of
his
argument,
mr.
weston
did
not
seem
to
be
calling
into
question
the
basic
proposition
that
this
court
established,
after
hearing
mr.
weston's
arguments
to
the
contrary,
in
fort
wayne
books
that
obscenity
is
not
speech
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
it
can
serve
as
a
predicate
offense
for
a
rico
statute.
secondly,
he
has
now--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
the
extent
that
a
final
determination
has
been
made
that
it
is
obscene,
the
first
amendment
does
not
care
and
thus,
in
that
sense,
it
is
invisible
once
it
has
been...
in
terms
of
first
amendment
values,
yes.
it
is
invisible
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
it's
inconsistent
with
the
holding
in
r.a.v.
because
r.a.v.
did
not
seem
to
call
into
question...
or
r.a.v.
was
obviously
concerned
with
content
basis.
and
i
don't
want
to
delay
unduly
in
rearguing
what
may
be
a
very
intriguing
dialogue
within
the
court
about
r.a.v.,
and
i
know
the
court
has
now
taken
the
wisconsin
case.
the
basic
holding
in
r.a.v....
and
it
was
a
unanimous
holding...
was
that
that
ordinance
had
to
fall
because
it
was
content
based.
this
court
has
held
that
as
serious
as
content
based
kinds
of
distinctions
are,
obscenity
is
a
different
matter,
and
obscenity
is
not
protected
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
second
aspect...
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
argument...
that
is
not
being
contested
is
arcara,
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a,
as
he
would
say,
nonspeech
predicate,
there
can,
in
fact,
be
forfeiture
of
what
he
considers
first
amendment
expressive
materials.
what
i
think
we
have
seen
today
is,
first
of
all,
an
assault
on
fort
wayne
books
without
his
having
said
in
the
petition
that
he
wants
to
see
fort
wayne
books
overruled.
accepting
the
proposition
that
fort
wayne
books
and
the
value
of
stare
decisis
is
still
good
constitutional
law
and
taking
that
with
arcara,
we
get
exactly
where
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
that
we
get
in
this
case,
that
we
somehow,
combining
those
two
holdings,
end
up
with
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
that
ends
up
being
quite
a
remarkable
proposition
that
is
unfounded
in
this
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence.
what
really
seems
to
be
at
issue
here
is
the
sense
of
disproportionality,
that
the
defendant,
the
petitioner,
stands
convicted
of
seven
obscenity
offenses,
and
yet
this
entire
business
enterprise,
including
what
he
considers
presumptively
expressive
and
protected
materials,
has
been
forfeited
to
the
government.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
petition
appendix
and
the
thorough
opinions
by
judge
rosenbaum
where
he
goes
through
a
very
careful
analysis
of
1963(a)(1),
(a)(2),
(a)(3),
and
showing
what
parts
of
the
business
proceeds,
interests,
corporations,
and
so
forth
are
being
forfeited
and
why
each
is
being
forfeited
appropriately
under
the
statute.
and
that
gets,
by
the
way,
to
part
of
the
response
i
think
to
this
sort
of
intuitive
sense
that
can
be
put
most
comfortably
i
think
in
eighth
amendment
terms
that
there
is
wild
disproportionality
at
work
here.
that
is
not
so
for
the
following
reasons,
and
if
i
may,
let
me
share
with
you
a
bit
of
the
record
in
the
case,
not
what
the
film--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
record
tells
us,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
were
essentially
here
10
businesses
and
adult
theaters
that
were
engaged
in
the
sale
of
literature
and
movies
that
all
partook
of
the
same
nature.
they
were
adult
entertainment
materials.
that's
what
this
was
all
about.
the
government
offered
to
introduce
into
evidence
not
only
the
obscene
materials,
and
at
the
jury
trial
the
first
film
that
was
shown,
she
male
encounters,
80
minutes
was
displayed
to
the
jury.
additional
films
were
displayed
to
the
jury.
the
government,
anticipating
the
very
kind
of
argument
that
was
eventually
made
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
said
there
are
others,
and
we
are
prepared
to
introduce
those.
an
objection
was
interposed
on
relevancy
grounds.
in
addition,
at
the
forfeiture
phase
of
the
trial,
there
was,
as
my
colleague
on
the
other
side
has
indicated,
introduced
to
the
court
400
plus
videos
and
magazines
that
the
district
court
at
page
153
of
the
petition
appendix
specifically
found
are
of
the...
without
making
the
same
kind
of
elaborate
review
of
every
minute
of
the
movie
or
every
aspect
of
the
book,
were
of
the
same
nature.
but
ultimately
what
the
court
also
had
before
it
and
what
the
jury
had
before
it
was
an
enterprise
that
was
rife
with
criminality:
secreted
assets,
under
reporting
of
income--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
it
is.
it's
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
not
necessary,
but
it's
part
of
my
case
in
the
sense
that
if
you
read
the
indictment,
the
indictment
alleged
various
tax
offenses
and
fraud--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--absolutely,
and
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--because
it
tells
us
about
the
nature
of
this
enterprise
and
the
criminality
of
the
enterprise
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--absolutely
not.
under...
and
the
reason
is
the
statute,
1962,
talks
about
a
pattern
of
racketeering.
this
court
in
hj,
inc.,
this
court
in
sedima--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
we
were--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
we
were
prepared
to
show
much
more--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
show
that,
in
fact,
there
was
a
pattern
of
racketeering,
and
then
the
other
elements
of
the
enterprise,
that
the
enterprise
was
used
in
the
offense.
that
is
to
say,
to
take
your
american
airlines--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
a
division
manager
or
if
the
president
himself
of
american
airlines,
if
mr.
crandall
orders
the
showing
of
this,
it
doesn't
mean
american
airlines
is
going
to
be
forfeited.
he
may...
it
is
in
personam.
this
operates
in
personam.
if
it's
corporate
policy,
yes.
i
would
have
to
say,
justice
stevens,
that
there
is
the
possibility
that
we
would
have
to
analyze
the
corporation's
liability.
but
recall--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--not
at
all
in
terms
of
corporate...
i'm
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
what
i
understand
you
to
be
concerned
about,
which
is
forfeiture
by
american--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--exactly,
forfeiture
of
an
entire
airline
on
the
basis
of
these
few
offenses.
my
response--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
would
have
to
know,
first
of
all,
whether
this
was,
in
fact,
corporate
policy,
board
of
directors
approved
policy,
and
the
like
when
we're
talking
about
a
corporate
forfeiture
as
opposed
to
the
in
personam
forfeiture
of
mr.
crandall's
own
interest
in
american...
airlines
because
he
has
to,
under
the
statute,
use
this
enterprise
for
criminal
purposes.
that's
the
evil
that
the
statute
is
getting
at,
and
that's
what
was
built
up
here.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
so
under
this
court's
interpretation
in
hj,
inc.
of
the
statute,
which
we
don't
quarrel
with.
in
fact,
we
think
it's
quite
correct
because
it
is
the
statute's
concern,
congress'
concern,
about
what
the
court
called
the
pattern,
that
is
to
say,
a
threat
of
continuity.
this
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
have
suggested
that
it
could
be
enough
as
long
as
there
is
the
threat
of
continuity,
and
that
is
why
i
will
not
concede
that
any,
other
than
the
most
irrational,
corporation
would
knowingly,
as
a
matter
of
corporate
policy,
continue
and
threaten
to
continue
within
the
meaning
of
hj,
inc.--
what
this
statute
was
aiming
at
and
why
this
court
has
seen
since
1984
so
little
of
these
kinds
of
predicate
offenses
is
the
kind
of
empire
that
we
saw
here,
one
that
is
essentially
given
over
to
the
display
of
materials
that
are
very
similar,
as
the
district
court
saw,
to
those--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
you
have
to
make
that
assumption.
the
point
that
i
am
getting
at
is
can
congress
constitutionally
say
once
you
prove
the
requisite
elements
of
rico,
effect
a
forfeiture.
in
our
view,
yes,
that
it
is
not
disproportionate
when,
in
fact,
the
enterprise
is
being
used
as
the
instrument
for
carrying
out
the
criminal
activity.
here
the
pattern
is
the
sale
of
obscene
materials.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
would
take
the
same
position,
that
it
is...
that
what
rico
is
getting
at...
and
i
think
this
is
what
is
critical
in
terms
of
a
first
amendment
analysis,
that
rico
is
neutral
in
terms
of
what
it
is
seeking
to
obtain.
it
is
seeking
to
obtain
proceeds
and
assets.
it
does
not
care
what
those
assets
are,
if
they're
cash
registers
or
if
they're
gideon's
bibles.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
as
long
as
there
is
an
appropriate
predicate
offense,
and
then
i
think
there
is
an
appropriate...
as
was
noted
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
arcara,
a
concern
that
congress...
that
the
government
may
be
getting
at
a
business
because
it
disfavors
that
particular
speech.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
it
would
have,
and
one
of
the
reasons
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--not
at
all.
because
of
the
government's
concern
about
the
nature
of
these
materials
and
not
wanting,
frankly,
to
traffic
in
obscene
materials,
the
government
did
not
need
to
go
into
the
business
or
otherwise
dispose
of
these
in
any
other
way
than
to
destroy.
i
should
note
the
fact
that
a
number
of
these
materials
were,
in
fact,
preserved
and
shipped
to
california,
and
i
don't
think
there
will
be
dispute
with
respect
to
that.
moreover,
the
adult
theaters
were
not
forfeited.
the
government
did
not
try
to
achieve
a
forfeiture
of
the
adult
theaters.
what
it
was,
in
fact,
focusing
on
were
these
bookstores...
and
this
was
all
before
the
jury
in
the
case...
photographs
of
the
interiors
of
these...
or
these
adult
entertainment
magazine
and
video
kinds
of
centers.
and
so,
the
jury
had
before
it
the
nature
of
this
enterprise
and
that
prompted
then
at
the
forfeiture
hearing
the
judge
to
conclude
that
what
had
been
established
here
was
a
vast
supply
network
that
permitted
this
pattern
of
racketeering
in
terms
of
obscenity
offenses
in
interstate
trafficking
in
obscene
materials
to
take
place.
that
is
to
say,
what
is
rico
getting
at?
it
is
an
enterprise...
an
individual's
use
of
that
enterprise
as
the
vehicle
for
commission
of
criminal
offenses.
and
when
congress
took
the
step
that
it
did
in
1984
to
include
obscenity
as
a
predicate
offense...
again
fort
wayne
books
said
that
was
all
right
to
do.
it
was
all
right
for
indiana.
it
was
all
right
for
congress...
it
did
so
based
on
congress'
concern
and
understanding
that
pornography
was,
in
fact,
linked
to
organized
crime
and,
in
fact,
was
a
major
supply
of
source,
financial
resources,
for
organized
crime.
that's
why
congress
saw
fit
to
include
it.
that
is
why
the
prosecutions
that
this
court
has
seen...
there
have
been
all
of
five.
this
court
has
seen
two.
the
pryba
case,
which
the
court
had
before
it
on
certiorari,
but
did
not
take
certiorari
a
few
years
ago.
all
were
the
same
type
as
what
we
have
here,
an
organized
criminal
enterprise
given
over
to
the
trafficking
in
obscene
materials,
and
it
also
was
characterized
by
these
other
aspects
of
secreted
assets,
hidden
income,
the
use
of
nominees
as
owners
of
the
corporation,
and
the
like.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
am
not.
i'm
not
moving
from
my
comment
to
justice
stevens.
but
in
terms
of
why
this
case
was
brought,
if
there
is
concern
about
this
case
was
brought
because
the
government
disfavors
certain
kinds
of
speech,
these
are
the
kinds
of
prosecutions
that
the
record
shows
that
the
united
states
has,
in
fact,
brought.
there
have
been
four
or
five
obscenity
predicate
rico
prosecutions.
two
have
made
it
to
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the...
we--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
may
have
misspoken,
justice
stevens.
i
am
not
prepared
to
concede,
as
mr.
weston
would
have
the
court
accept,
that
obscenity
is
speech.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
that's
not
of
interest
to
the
government.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
not
of
interest
to
the
government.
the
government's
concern,
justice
stevens,
was
that
these
materials
were
of...
as
the
district
court
saw
who
had
the
materials
before
him,
of
a
similar
nature.
and
the
government
is
not
interested
either
in
storing
these
materials
indefinitely,
nor
is
it
interested
in
selling
these
materials--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--which
might
be
adjudicated
to
be
obscene.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
at
least,
i
think
it's
more
likely...
no,
i
don't
concede
that.
i
do
think
that
you
might
have
a
charge
of
selective
prosecution.
under
this
court's
analysis
in
waite,
that
kind
of
argument
can
obviously
be
advanced.
it
was
not
advanced
here.
there's
no
discussion
or
suggestion
by
mr.
alexander
that
he
alone
has
been
singled
out
for
prosecution.
no.
as
long
as
the
government
is
proceeding
with
obscenity
as
the
predicate,
it
is
abiding
by
congress'
intent
and
it
is
not
making
content
based
distinctions.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if,
in
fact...
but
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
we
have
many
other.
in
fact,
the
united
states...
if
there
is
some
impression,
justice
scalia,
that
the
government
is
only
bringing
rico
obscenity
predicate
cases,
we
bring
about
100
cases
a
year.
one
or
two
of
those
a
year
are
typically
obscenity
predicate
type
offenses.
but
if,
to
accept
the
hypothetical,
we
were
only
using
rico
which
had
seven
or
eight
predicate
offenses
and
using
it
only,
i
think,
number
one,
one
can
obviously
appropriately
be
concerned
with
the
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
and
the...
and
whose
power
is
that?
it
is
the
executive
branch's
authority
to
determine
what
is,
in
fact,
the
most
important
kinds
of
prosecutions
to
bring.
but
because
of
the
first
amendment
overlay
that
does,
in
fact,
arise
in
this
context,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
an
argument
could
very
well
be
mounted...
and
it
might
be
accepted...
that
the
government
is
engaged
in
selective
enforcement,
selective
prosecution
of
cases,
and
we
would
take
that
through
the
waite
analysis.
i
thank
the
court.
