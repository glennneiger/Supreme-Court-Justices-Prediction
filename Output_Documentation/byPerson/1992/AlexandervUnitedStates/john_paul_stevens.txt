mr.
weston,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory?
i
understand
what
you're
saying
about
speech
both
causing
it
and
being
what's
forfeited.
what
if
what
was
forfeited
was...
say
american
airlines
showed
a
couple
of
obscene
movies
on
a
flight.
would
you
say
that
that
would
justify
forfeiture
of
the
whole
airline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
statute
would
it?
i'm
curious
about
how
the
statute
operates.
here
his
entire
business
was
forfeited
because
a
half
a
dozen
or
so
obscene
items
were
seized.
would
the
statute
operate
in
the
same
way
in
my
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that
would
not
violate
any...
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
to
take
over
the
airline--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
they're
not
engaged
in
the
speech
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
for
that
reason,
not
because
of
the
magnitude
of
the
seizure.
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
the
magnitude
of
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--was
seized
in
relation
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--small
amount
of
what
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
the
entire
business...
any
contribution
of
the
business,
no
matter
how
trivial,
is
the
proceeds
of
a
predicate
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
or
as
a
statutory
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
statute,
there...
the
prosecutor
would
have
the
same
duty
to
seize
the
entire
airline
that
he
has
here
and
seize
the
entire
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
entirely
invisible
to
the
first
amendment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--after
r.a.v.?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
consistent
with
the
holding
in
r.a.v.?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
starr,
is
that
part
of
your
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
necessary
to
prove
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
the
obscenity
offenses
were
the
only
predicate
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
do
we
talk
about
the
other
offense?
let's
assume
he's
a
real
bad
person
for
all
these
other
reasons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that...
tell
me
this
because
i
really
am
curious
because
the
statute
is
a
difficult
statute
to
understand.
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
with
respect
to
his
answer
to
my
hypothetical
about
american
airlines,
that
you
would
have
the
authority
under
the
statute
to
forfeit
the
entire
airline
if
they
showed
three
or
four
obscene
movies
in
a
flight
from
here
to
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
had
a
pattern
of
racketeering
with
six
obscenity
offenses.
that's
enough,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
statute
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
know
you
could
have
proved
a
lot
more,
but
is
it
not
true
that
under
the
statute,
all
you
had
to
prove
was
six
obscenity
offenses
to
get
your
pattern
of
racketeering--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
helped
sell
a
few
tickets
to
the...
from
here
to
california.
isn't
that
enough?
isn't
that
all
you
need
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
concerned
about
the
disproportionately
problem--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--each
of
which
contributed
to
the
running
of
the
business
because
it
induced
some
people
to
take
the
flight
that
they
might
not
otherwise
have
taken.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
assume
the
board
of
directors
approved
the
schedule
of
the
flight,
you
know,
what...
the
movies
they're
going
to
show
on
the
flight
to
california.
it's
rather
unlikely,
but
assume
they
did.
and
they
decided
that
there
were
six
very
interesting
swedish
films
that--
[laughter]
--might
be
very
attractive
to
a
lot
of
travelers,
and
they
decided
to
show
them.
they
turn
out
to
be
obscene,
and
they
had
advertised
them.
they
could
forfeit
the
whole
airline.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
just
told
me
six
is
enough
for
a
pattern.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
you
do
or
do
not
disfavor
this
kind
of
speech
if
it's
nonobscene?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
were
you
saying?
i'm
just
trying...
i
didn't
quite
understand
whether
you
said
the
government
did--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
no.
i
understand.
i'm
assuming
that
there's
a
lot
of
this
stuff
out
there
that's
not
obscene.
we
have
to
presume
that.
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
you're
telling
us
that
the
government
disfavors
the
nonobscene,
erotic
material
speech.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it's
puzzling
why
you
burned
it
all.
