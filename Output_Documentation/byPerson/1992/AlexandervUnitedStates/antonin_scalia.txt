these
were
also
called
sexually
oriented
materials
or
not?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
last
of
the
mohicans?
what
are
we
talking
about
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
business
in
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
adult
bookstores.
what
kind
of
video?
were
they
adult
video
stores,
so-called?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
the
seizure
is
concerned,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--once
it's
the
government's
property...
i
suppose
if
the
government
appropriately
took
control
of
it
and
possession
of
it
and
ownership
of
it,
i
suppose
the
government
can
do
with
it
what
it
wants,
and
the
objection
to
whether
the
government
ought
to
have
burned
it
or
not
probably
should
depend
on
what
its
character
is.
maybe
the
government
didn't
want
to
be
in
the
pornography
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
objection
is
to
the
seizure
of
it
and
the...
placing
the
ownership
in
the
government,
not
to
what
the
government
does
with
what
it
owns
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
that
happened
here,
didn't
it?
i
mean,
your
client
was
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
business
did
not
continue
to
operate
while
he
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
this
conviction.
i'm
talking
about
prior
convictions.
my
understanding
was
that
there
had
been
prior
convictions
on
obscenity
charges.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
weston,
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
have
had...
you
say
you
would
not
have
any
objection
to
that
under
the
first
amendment
if
the
predicate
offenses
had
not
been
speech
offenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
take
away
all
the
media
businesses.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
okay.
and
similarly,
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
have
no
objection
if
it
was
a
speech
offense
for
the
predicate
rico
offense,
and
the
punishment,
no
matter
how
severe,
life
imprisonment,
was
not
the
taking
away
of
media
businesses
or
of
media
documents,
books,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
see,
i
don't
see
how...
what
you're
doing
is
combining
two
positions,
neither
one
of
which
alone
would
be...
would
violate
the
first
amendment
on
your
admission.
and
you
say
that
somehow
when
you
combine
the
two,
although
they
don't
reinforce
each
other
as
far
as
i
can
see,
it
is
a
first
amendment
objection.
there
are
two
problems
involved.
one
is
the
chill
of
the
speech.
right?
and
the
chill
could
be
affected
just
as
much
by
imprisonment
as
by
taking
away
the
person's
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
speech
will
inevitably
be
suppressed
whenever
you
go
after
anybody
in
the
media
business
under
rico,
whether
it's
for
a
speech
offense
or
for
any
other
offense.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
fraud
convictions?
are
they
speech
convictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
inherently
you
said,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
to
make
a
representation,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
always
performed
by
speech,
by
communication.
now,
that
speech
is
unprotected
to
the
extent
that
it
commits
a
fraud,
and
the
speech
in
this
case
is
unprotected
to
the
extent
that
it
becomes
obscenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
hesitant
to
say
that
no
media
business
can
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--taken
for
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
brought
no
other
rico...
that's
what
i
understood
justice
souter's
questions
to
be.
the
only
rico
prosecution
that
the
government
ever
brings
are
obscenity
prosecutions
of
this
sort.
you
wouldn't...
you
think
that
would
be
a
basis
to
suspect
that
the
government
is...
has
some
antagonism
towards
the
speech?
i
would
be
prepared
to
consider
that
evidence
of
such
antagonism.
if
you
brought
no
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
a
few
other
rico
cases,
don't
you?
[laughter]
