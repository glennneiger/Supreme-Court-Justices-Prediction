mr.
weston,
i
take
it
you
don't
claim
that
the
rico
statute
did
not
authorize
these
seizures.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
the
provisions
of...
you
don't
think
you
can
find
any
basis
for
objecting
to
this
forfeiture
in
the
provisions
of
the
statute
authorizing
the
forfeiture.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
this
forfeiture
that
the
government
insisted
on
was
outside
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
just
as
a
statutory
construction
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
be
here
making
this
argument
if
your
client
sold
a
reasonable
amount
of...
well,
an
unreasonable
amount
of
cocaine
in
his
bookstores
along
with
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
though
his
entire
business
was
seized.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you
still
have
an
eighth
amendment
argument?
