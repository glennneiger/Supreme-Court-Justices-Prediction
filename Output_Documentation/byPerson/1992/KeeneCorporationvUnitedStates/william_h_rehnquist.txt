chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
92-166,
keene
corporation
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
repudiating
long-standing
precedent,
mr.
taranto,
you
mean
federal
circuit
or
court
of
claims
precedent,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
general
principle
of
law
do
you
base
this
argument,
mr.
taranto?
i
mean,
we
don't
ordinarily
review
court
of
claims
or
federal
circuit
precedent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
wouldn't
take
a
case
here,
i
don't
think,
to
hear
it
argued
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
failed
to
follow
stare
decisis
in
connection
with
a
ninth
circuit
precedent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
congress
overhaul
the
statutes
governing
the
court
of
claims
and
the
federal
circuit
in
1982
other
than
just
do
what
was
necessary
to
create
the
new
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
amendments
you
say
that
weren't
occasioned
by
the
creation
of
the
new
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
wouldn't
need
a
special
statute,
would
you,
if
all
congress
wanted
was
the
application
of
claim
preclusion
law?
that
would
apply
without
any
statute.
certainly
other
courts
throughout
the
country
apply
it
without
having
a
special
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
that
decided?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
little
tucker
act
is
district
court
under
10,000,
or
whatever
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
different
cases
did
your
client
have
pending
in
connection
with
this
asbestos
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
in
other
courts,
would
you
be
specific?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
was
it
thrown
out
of
the
district
court
in
new
york?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
in
effect
try
to
relitigate
that
in
the
district
of
columbia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
went
back
and
tried
to
cure,
basically,
the
defect
that
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--district
court
in
new
york
had
found.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
by
the
time
it
arose.
does
that
mean...
are
you
saying,
then,
by
the
time
the
government
made
a
motion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
it
arise
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
second
lawsuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
matter,
ordinarily
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
that's
not
something
that
the
government
can
waive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wallace,
you
say
related...
brought
in
two
different
courts.
wasn't
the
reason
that
the
cotton
claimants
sued
the
officials
away
from
washington
not
so
much
that
congress
said
they
couldn't
sue
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
that
venue
requirements,
if
you
were
going
to
sue
a
local
official
who
converted
the
cotton,
you
would
have
to
sue
where
that
official
was
found?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say,
even
if
there
hadn't
been
the
venue
problem,
there
would
have
been
a
jurisdictional
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
have
depended...
you
could
have
gotten
a
judgment,
i
suppose,
against
an
insolvent
official,
and
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
money
as
a
result
of
it,
whereas
you
get
a
judgment
against
the
government,
and
hopefully
it's
not
insolvent.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william

rehnquist
section
1500,
mr.
wallace,
doesn't
affect
claims
pending
in
any
court
other
than
the
court
of
claims,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
one
could
have
pending
several
actions
in
different
district
courts
throughout
the
country,
and
they
would
be
in
no
way
affected
by
section
1500.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
taranto,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
the
case
is
submitted.
