justice
byron
r.
white
but
i...
you
would
still
say
that
even
if
there
hadn't
been
a
precedent
until
this
one,
that
the
court
of
appeals
just
had
it
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
since
it
would
be
the
only
court
to
construe
that
statute,
you
couldn't
wait
for
a
conflict.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
the
ca
fed
up
to
now
recognized
that
rule
they're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
it
ever
accept
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
by
the
time
the
ca
fed
was
created,
the...
you
say
the
law
in
the
court
of
claims
was
pretty
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unsuccessfully.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
taranto,
you...
if
there's
a
suit
pending
in
another
court
when
you
file
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
the
court
of
claims
dismisses
it,
even
though
at
the
time
of
the
dismissal
the
other
suit
has
itself
been
dismissed...
which
is
the
case
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
dismisses
it.
can
you
then
file
another
suit
in
the
court
of
claims?
i
would
think
you
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
court
of
claims
has
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
lose
the
suit
here,
if
we
affirm
the
ca
fed,
you
might
be
able
to
sue
again
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--court
of
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
the
theory
that
it
would
tie
up
government
resources
in
two
suits
doesn't
hold
water
particularly.
your
latter
point
of
collateral
estoppel,
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
there
are
two
suits
going
on
in
two
different
courts
over
roughly
the
same
set
of
facts,
one
of
the
courts
is
going
to
stay
and
let
the
other
court
go
forward--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
that
one
suit
will
be
quiescent
and
the
other
one
won't.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
assume
the
government
would
want
to
stay
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
got
to
the
second
reason
you
gave
the
federal
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
ever
get
out
of
committee?
