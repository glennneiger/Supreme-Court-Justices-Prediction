justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the--
--mr.
taranto,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
possible
that
the
precedent
in
the
court
of
claims
decisions
is
not
quite
as
uniform
as
you
suggest.
the
british
american
tobacco
case,
i
think
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
word
"claim"
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
facts
existing
and
operating
in
both
cases
are
the
same,
and
there's
a
similar
holding
in
the
los
angeles
shipbuilding
and
drydock
case,
and
so
i'd
like
you
to
explain
to
me
whether
the
precedent
really
was
as
uniform
as
you
suggest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
los
angeles
shipbuilding
was
decided
after
casman.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
suppose
that
the
1500
is
couched
as
a
jurisdictional
statute,
and
normally
you
would
think
that
means
the
court
of
federal
claims
had
no
jurisdiction.
