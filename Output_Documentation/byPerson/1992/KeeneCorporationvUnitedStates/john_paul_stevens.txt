let
me
be
sure
i
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
why
they
had
to
be
brought
in
different
suits.
if
recovery
was
going
to
take
the
form
of
recovery
against
the
officer
individually,
it
would
have
to
be
brought
in
the
district
court,
but
the
amount
of
money
recovered
would
be
the
same
in
either
event,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
just
a
question
of
really
a
formal
procedural
difference
between
the
two
suits.
they're
really
sued
on
the
same
basic
set
of
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
have
gotten
precisely
the
same
relief
in
terms
of
dollars,
at
least.
the
judgment
would
read
differently,
because
in
one
case
it
would
read
against
the
individual
and
in
the
other
against
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wallace,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
the
collateral
estoppel
argument,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
would
cut
both
ways,
that
if
a...
you
might
prevail
in
the
other
suit
and
get
the
benefit
of
it,
also.
i
thought
the
justification
for
the
statute
was
something
beyond
collateral
estoppel.
it
was
the
burden
of
defending
multiple
cases
whether
or
not...
and
that
collateral
estoppel
would
not
be
a
sufficient
protection
against
that
burden
of
simultaneous
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
what
you're...
was
that...
is
that
theory
of
what
the
words,
"in
respect
to"
mean
been
expressed
in
any
cases?
it
seems
a
rather
strange
use
of
the
language,
very
candidly,
even
though
i
understand
the
point
you're
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
were
precedents,
i
suppose.
they
had
nationwide
effect,
and
they
were
precedents
on
which
the
business
community
might
reasonably
rely
for
a
long
period
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
arguing
now
is
that
they
may
not
prevail
even
under
the
rule
they
advocate,
but
that
also
suggests
that
maybe
the
federal
circuit
didn't
have
to
go
so
far
to
defeat
this
particular
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
has
greater
authority
than
the
court
of
claims
decisions,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
with
notice
of
the
statute,
and
you
also
say
with
notice
of
the
interpretation
that
the
court
of
claims
had
given
to
the
statute
which
you
say
would
not
have
brought
this
within
any
of
the
exceptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taranto,
would
you
comment
on
what
i
understand
mr.
wallace's
argument
to
be,
that
you
really
don't
come
within
the
exception,
the
particular
exception
that
makes
the
strongest
case
for
saying
congress
said
you
have
to
sue
in
two
different
forums
because
you
are
not
seeking
purely
equitable
relief
in
another
forum
and
damages
in
this
forum?
