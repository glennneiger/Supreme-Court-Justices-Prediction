are
you
in
any
position
to
make
an
argument
that
congress
might
be
deemed
to
have
accepted
that
interpretation?
was
there
any
reenactment
or
amendment
that
might
have
picked
it
up
if
we
accepted
the
theory
that,
given
the
peculiarities
of
claims
in
the
fed
circuit
jurisdiction,
congress
might
be
deemed
to
accept
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
taranto,
under
the
civil
version
of
the
same
evidence
rule
that
you
were
referring
to
a
moment
ago,
would
two
suits
simply
based
on
at
least
a
community
of
fact
but
one
sounding
in
tort
and
one
sounding
in
contract
have
been
precluded
as
simultaneous
suits?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
you
had
the
mutuality.
