mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.c.
section
1500,
which
says
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
against
the
united
states
if
the
plaintiff
has
pending
in
another
court
another
case
against
the
government
or
its
agents
for
or
in
respect
to
that
claim.
the
federal
circuit,
expressly
repudiating
long-settled
precedent,
held
that
section
1500
automatically
requires
dismissal
whenever
the
plaintiff
had
pending
sometime
during
its
suit
another
action
growing
out
of
the
same
transaction
or
operative
facts.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
yes,
that's
right,
and
it
required
dismissal
even
if
the
actions
had
to
be
pursued
separately,
and
even
if
the
other
action
is
over.
based
on
this
new
rule,
petitioner
came
and
had
its
cases
dismissed
after
10
years
of
pretrial
proceedings
were
completed.
denying
keene
a
hearing
on
its
claims
based
on
the
government's
sale
of
asbestos,
its
requirement
of
asbestos
in
products
it's
purchased,
and
its
manner
of
operating
shipyards.
our
position
is
that
the
federal
circuit
misconstrued
section
1500
in
two
respects,
and
that
two
longstanding
constructions
of
1500
should
be
reinstated.
first,
two
suits
are
not
for
or
in
respect
to
the
same
claim
where
congress
has
insisted
that
the
claims
in
the
two
suits
are
different
by
demanding
that
they
must
be
brought
separately,
and
second,
by
its
plain
terms,
the
statute
does
not
apply
after
the
plaintiff
no
longer
has
pending
any
other
suit.
now,
on
the
first
position,
i
want
to
make
four
points.
the
first
is
that
it
was
settled
law
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
federal
circuit,
two
of
the
only
courts,
aside
from
this
court,
that
could
ever
address
this
question,
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century,
that
when
congress
has
declared
that
two
separate
rights
of
action
must
be
litigated
in
two
different
courts,
the
court
should
not
turn
around
and
read
1500
as
saying
that
the
two
suits
are
really
for
and
in
respect
to
the
same
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no.
i
think
that...
well,
stare
decisis
in
its
strict
terms
perhaps
applies
only
to
this
court's
review
of
its
own
precedent.
nevertheless,
because
stare
decisis
is
a
policy-based
doctrine
the
same--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i
think
that's
right,
but
this,
i
think,
presents
two
unique
circumstances.
one
is
that
the
issue
of
1500's
interpretation
is
unique
to
the
federal
circuit.
there
can't
be
a
lower
court
conflict,
and
as
a
consequence,
all
of
the
reliant's
interest
both
of
litigants
like
keene
and
of
congress
in
legislating
in
the
area,
must
necessarily
look
to
established
law
in
that
circuit
to
guide
litigants
and
guide
congress,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
think
that
cases
like
the
casman
line
of
cases
demand
special
respect.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
the
principle--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right.
the
reading
that
the
court
of
claims
and
the
federal
circuit
gave
to
the
statute
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
fact
we
think
reflects
the
most
natural
reading
of
1500's
language.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
we
do
have
a
version
of
that
argument.
in
1982,
congress
took
a
broad
look
at
the
whole
set
of
statutes
governing
what
was
then
the
court
of
claims,
transformed
that
court
into
a
trial
court,
claims
court
and
the
federal
circuit,
and
reenacted
1500,
merely
changing
the
name
of
the
court
to
which
it
applied.
by
that
time,
the
statute
had
been
consistently
construed
in
both
of
the
ways
that
we
suggest,
and
we
think
it
is
an
appropriate
inference
that
had
it
been
construed
otherwise,
its
quite
draconian
consequences
would
in
fact
have
led
congress
to
take
a
second
look
at
it.
the
fact
that
it
had
been
construed
so
as
not
to
deprive
litigants
of
rights
is
i
think
the
best
explanation
for
why
no
real
issue
was
made
of
1500
when
it
was
reenacted
in
1982.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
did
make
a
number
of
substantive
amendments
in
looking
through
the
entire
range
of
statutes.
it
added
certain
limited
jurisdiction
to
the...
now
the
claims
court
to
provide
certain
kinds
of
equitable
relief
that
it
couldn't
have
provided
before.
it
provided
a
special
transfer
statute
to
ensure
against
precisely
the
kind
of
loss
of
rights
for
filing
in
the
wrong
court
that
is
at
issue
here,
and
it
also
made
a
number
of
substantive
amendments
that
governed
other
aspects
of
what
used
to
be
the
court
of
claims
and
also
the
court
of
customs
and--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
that's
right.
it
was
a
more
general
review
in
1982
of
the
statutory
regime
governing
suits
against
the
united
states,
and
in
particular
in
the
court
of
claims.
when
the
statute
asks
if
a
second
suit
is
for
and
respect
to
the
claim
in
a
first
suit,
it
is
naturally
understood,
we
think,
as
targeting
repetitive
litigation,
situations
where
two
suits
are
brought
when
there
really
should
be
one,
but
that
is
not
the
situation.
there
is
no
repetition
when
two
suits
are
brought
on
different
legal
rights
that
congress
has
said
must
be
litigated
separately.
this
is
exactly
the
rule
of
claim
preclusion
law,
which
we
think
is
the
obvious
place
to
turn
to
in
defining
when
two
suits
should
be
treated
as
for
or
in
respect
to
the
same
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
what
1500
does
is
apply
before
any
judgment
is
reached.
claim
preclusion
law
only
kicks
in
once
there
is
a
judgment
in
a
first
suit.
what
1500
does
is
to
say
a
plaintiff
cannot
proceed
in
two
different
forums
up
to
the
time
of
judgment,
which
claim
preclusion
would
say
nothing
about.
it
protects
the
government
against
that
problem.
so
1500
performs
a
role
in
addition
to
claim
preclusion
law,
but
we
never--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
it
would.
let
me
say
first
that
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
mistake,
in
any
event,
whatever
that
1868
legislative
history
concerning
the
cotton
claim
said,
to
carry
that
forward
to
the
new
statute
in
a
new
legal
landscape
to
control
the
interpretation
of
this.
but
even
on
its
own
terms,
the
only
thing
that
one
can
tell
from
the
1868
history
is
that
congress
wanted
to
relax
one
condition
of
claim
preclusion
law,
and
that
is
the
condition
of
mutuality
of
the
parties.
nothing
about
the
1868
history
suggested
that
two
claims,
aside
from
mutuality
of
the
parties
that
would
otherwise
be
the
same,
would
be
within
the
statute.
the
cotton
claims
would,
under
the
best
view
that
we
can
discover
of
19th
century
res
judicata
law,
in
fact
have
been
the
same
had
they
been
against
the
same
defendant.
one
of
the
tests
for
establishing
sameness
of
claims
was
the
so-called
same
evidence
rule.
if
the
evidence
in
one
case
would
be
enough
to
support
the
claim
in
the
other
case,
the
same
evidence
would
suffice
in
the
claims,
it
would
be
treated
the
same,
and
a
common
law
conversion
claim
would
under
that
test
be
the
same
as
the
statutory
conversion
claim
which
added
simply
the
element
of
loyalty,
because
the
same
evidence
that
proved
loyalty
in
conversion
would,
as
with
a
lesser
included
offense,
prove
conversion.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
it
was
when
you
take
time
into
account.
like
any
other
body
of
precedent,
at
a
certain
point
earlier
decisions
are
reinterpreted
and
perhaps
even
altered.
the
earlier
interpretation
of
1500
or
its
predecessor
in
the
court
of
claims
took
this
broader
view.
what
happened,
then,
in
1956
with
the
casman
case
was
that
the
court
recognized
that
where
congress
has
insisted
that
claims
be
brought
in
two
different
forums,
they
should
not
be
treated
the
same.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
within
a
year
of
that.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
but
shortly
after
that,
it
became
the
established
rule,
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
the
court
of
claims,
that
if
a
litigant
was
forced
into
two
separate
suits,
they
were
not
to
be
treated
as
the
same,
and
i
certainly
don't
know
of
a
single
instance...
and
i
don't
think
the
government
has
cited
one...
where
any
litigant
was
thrown
out
under
1500
after
los
angeles
shipyard,
which
may
simply
have
not
fully
appreciated
casman.
but
in
any
event,
since
the
early
sixties,
for
30
years
i
don't
think
there's
a
single
case
where
that
rule
failed
to
be
applied
where
a
litigant
lost
rights
by
virtue
of
bringing
in
two
separate
suits
claims
that
congress
has
said
had
to
be
brought
in
two
separate
suits.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
first
moved
away
from
that
rule
in
a
predecessor
of
this
case,
the
johns-manville
case,
and
then
clarified
that
it
really
meant--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
ca
fed...
it
did,
in
i
think
the
boston
five
cents
savings
bank
case,
if
i
recall
it
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that
was...
i
don't
remember
exactly.
in
the
mid-eighties,
i
think.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
1988.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
the
court
of
claims...
the
casman
decision
had
been
cited
over
and
over,
and
it
had
been
specifically
applied
in
1976
in
the
allied
materials
case
to
circumstances
even
where
money
damages
were
sought
under
two
different
claims,
so
that
the
type
of
relief
was
not
the
only
condition
for
distinguishing
claims.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
in
the
19th
century,
the
answer
is
probably
not.
there
is
always
some
difference
in
evidence,
as
there
would
be
here
with
the
tort
and
contract
claims,
if
only
because
there
are
different
legal
elements.
in
the
19th
century,
that
same
evidence
test
probably
wouldn't
have
applied,
but
on
the
other
hand
there
would
have
been
no
real
need
for
it,
because--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
mutuality,
and
in
the
19th
century
res
judicata
insisted
on
something
much
closer
to
the
legal
theory
as
opposed
to
the
transaction
base
at
best.
now,
let
me
say
that
under
this
reading,
this
long-established
reading
of
1500,
the
statute
performs
two
very
limited
but
sensible
functions,
and
these
were
in
fact
the
functions
that
when
the
justice
department
last
year
opposed
repeal
of
1500
it
told
congress
it
performed.
the
justice
department
did
not
say
that
the
provision
applied
to
the
sequencing
of
merely
related
claims.
it
said
one
function
was
to
bar
forum
shopping
in
those
cases
that
are
within
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
the
district
court.
a
plaintiff...
which
includes
all
tax
refund
cases
and
little
tucker
act
cases,
and
perhaps
and
others.
the
plaintiff
can't
just
test
out
the
two
forums
up
to
the
time
of
judgment
and
see
which
judge
is
going
to
look
more
favorably
upon
its
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
up
to
$10,000,
all
contract
claims,
constitutional
claims,
et
cetera.
the
second
function
is
to
preclude
simultaneous
suits
where
there
is
not
concurrent
jurisdiction
but
the
plaintiff
has
filed
the
case
in
two
different
forums,
and
there
the
statute
simply
bars
the
plaintiff
from
proceeding
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
until
the
district
court's
lack
of
jurisdiction
has
been
established,
as
it
sometimes
requires
some
years
of
litigation
to
do.
and
these
functions
are
obviously
modest,
but
as
i
say,
the
justice
department
explained
why
1500
should
be
kept,
when
it
opposed
repeal
to
congress
by
reference
only
to
those
functions
and
not
to
the
much
more
draconian
function
that
it
suggests
today
of
sequencing
merely
related
suits.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
it
was.
the
final
reason,
then,
in
support
of
this
first
position
is
precisely
the
draconian
consequences
of
the
federal
circuit's
new
version.
the
fact
is
that,
like
keene,
many
litigants
seeking
redress
against
the
government
must
file
in
separate
cases,
whether
they
have
tort
and
contract
claims,
or
as
many
of
the
amici
in
this
case
point
out,
they
have
a
statutory
challenge
to
some
government
action
and
also
are
taking
challenge.
the
regular
and
unavoidable
effect
of
the
government's
position
requiring
sequencing
of
these
suits
is
the
loss
of
many
litigants'
tucker
act
claims
either
through
the
sheer
delay
of
postponing
their
adjudication
perhaps
for
years,
as
in
this
case
it
would
be
7
or
8
years,
or
even
worse,
through
the
expiration
of
statutes
of
limitations
if
equitable
tolling
is
unavailable.
let
me
turn--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
we
had
two
cases
in
the
court
of
claims,
which
were
then
consolidated,
one
involving
the
contract
claims,
one
involving
the
takings
claims.
in
other
courts,
we
had
an
omnibus
tort
claim
with
a--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
the
initial
omnibus
ftca
action
was
brought
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
after
that
was
thrown
out
the
same
action
was
tried
in
the
district
of
columbia,
essentially
exactly
the
same
complaint.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
essentially
because
the
administrative
notice
requirement
of
the
ftca
imposes
a
specificity
requirement
that
the
court
found
keene
could
not
meet
as
to
each
of
the
underlying
tens
of
thousands
of
claims
against
the
government.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
after
filing
a
new
series
of
administrative
notices,
which
were
subsequently
also
found
to
be
jurisdictionally
inadequate.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
that's
right,
and
the
one
other
suit
that
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--unsuccessfully,
that's
right.
keene
has
never
had
a
hearing
on
its
tort
claims
because
of
this
jurisdictional
problem
or
because
of
this
ruling
on
the
contract
claims.
the
one
other
suit
that
i
didn't
mention
is,
briefly
in
one
of
the
suits
brought
against
keene
there
was
a
third-party
action
impleading
the
united
states
and
that
was
voluntarily
dismissed
in
order
to
proceed
on
that
issue
in
these
other
suits.
the
second
point,
second
position,
is
that
section
1500,
regardless
of
the
scope
of
the
claim
language,
has
no
application
once
the
other
suit
in
another
court
is
over,
and
that's
so
whatever
the
court
should
do
when
1500
is
raised
while
another
case
is
pending.
again,
i
have
three,
i
think
simple
points
for
this.
first,
by
its
terms,
the
statute
applies
only
when
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
pending
another
suit.
it
simply
does
not
come
into
play,
let
alone
require
dismissal,
when
no
other
suit
is
pending.
second,
even
the
government's
version
of
the
policy
of
1500,
protection
against
simultaneous
dual
related
litigation,
has
no
application
once
there
is
no
dual
litigation.
after
any
other
suit
outside
the
court
of
federal
claims
is
over,
there
is
simply
no
dual
litigation
of
any
sort
to
protect
against.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
there
are
two
separate
questions
to
address.
one
is
whether
at
the
time
when
another
suit
is
pending
the
jurisdiction
label
automatically
requires
dismissal.
no
issue
is
raised
as
to
that
here.
the
other
issue,
which
is
the
issue
here,
is
what
happens
if
there
was
earlier
in
the
proceeding
a
jurisdictional
defect
that
is
no
longer
present,
and
what
this
court's
decision
in
newman-green
establishes,
what
was
established
even
before,
is
that
even
as
to
a
pure
jurisdictional
provision,
the
existence
of
an
earlier
jurisdictional
defect
does
not
mean
that
the
case
shouldn't
go
forward.
in
fact,
the
court
said
the
case
should
go
forward
once
that
defect
is
cured.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here,
even
on
the
assumption
that
1500's
jurisdiction
language
has
to
be
read
as
making
it
a
pure
jurisdictional
provision.
we
have
a
situation
where,
even
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
defect
earlier
in
the
litigation,
by
the
time
the
question
of
dismissal
arose,
there
was
no
longer
that
jurisdictional
defect,
and
as
in
newman-green,
we
think
it
is
perfectly
appropriate,
and
indeed
it
would
be
unfair--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
that's
right.
by
the
time--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i'm
just
saying
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
issue
was
not
brought
to
anybody's
attention
here
for
8
years
during
this
litigation.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right,
but
in
newman-green
itself,
had
the
parties
raised
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation
the
fact
that
there
was
a
nondiverse
party,
then
had
that
defect
not
been
cured,
of
course,
dismissal
would
have
been
required.
what
this
court
said
in
newman-green,
confirming
many
lower
courts'
views,
is
that
even
though
there
was
no
jurisdiction
because
of
the
nondiverse
party
at
the
day
the
suit
was
filed,
and
years
during
the
litigation,
once
that
defect
was
cured,
the
case
should
and
can
go
forward.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
justice
scalia,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
example
either
way
on
that
question.
i've
been
looking
for
other
situations
where
the
question
of
a
jurisdictional
defect
that
existed
earlier
in
the
proceeding
but
now
coming
to
an
end
has
been
presented,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
situation
except
the
newman-green
one,
and
there,
i
think
the
rationale
does
properly
extend
to
other
situations,
including
this
one,
that
a
certain
measure
of
practicality
is
necessary,
and
once
the
jurisdictional
defect
is
over,
there's
no
reason
to
dismiss
the
suit.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
there
is--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that
has
not
been
the
traditional
rule
for
measuring
the
time
at
which
diversity
must
arise.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right,
but
i
think
newman-green
confirmed
what
was
a
longstanding
recognition
in
the
lower
courts
that
a
jurisdictional
defect,
even
if
it
required
dismissal
when
it
was
present,
did
not
necessarily
require
dismissal
once
the
defect
was
over.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
that's
right,
but
then...
but--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--except--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--for
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
question
is
an
open
one.
although
the
claims
court
has
recently
addressed
it
favorably,
the
question
is
an
open
one
whether
equitable
tolling
would
be
available.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
claims
court
in
a
decision
that
came
down
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
held
in
exactly
these
circumstances
that
equitable
tolling
would
be
available.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
might.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we
might,
although
i
must
say
it
would
take
no
doubt
several
years
of
litigation
for
the
issue
to
go
back
to
the
federal
circuit
to
decide
whether
the
claims
court,
which
is
now
just
a
trial
court,
was
correct
in
that
particular
decision.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
we...
i
mean,
i
do
think
that
it
does
help.
i
don't
want
to
place
too
much
weight
on
it,
but
it
does
suggest
that
1500
appearing
amidst
numerous
other
provisions
that
talk
about
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment
properly
can
be
interpreted
to
focus
on
the
presence
of
any
jurisdictional
defect
at
the
time
judgment
is
entered,
judgment...
the
entry
of
judgment
often
being
described
as
the
single
distinguishing
characteristic
of
what
makes
a
court
a
court
as
opposed
to
anything
else.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
for
one
thing
its
authority
at
the
outset,
before
1948
section
1500
didn't
use
the
word,
"jurisdiction"
at
all.
it
was
a
provision
about
what
should
happen
in
the
filing
and
the
prosecution
of
a
claim,
and
there
i
think
the
language
helps
us
considerably,
because
one
would
not
ordinarily
think
that
a
rule
like
that
should
automatically
carry
the
rigid
dismissal
result
as
a
matter
of
remedy.
there
would
still
be
an
open
question
about
what
the
remedy
is
for
the
violation
of
a
filing
rule,
and
it's
that
flexibility
as
to
remedy
that
in
fact
the
court
of
claims
itself
regularly
applied,
starting
in
the
1960's,
time
and
time
again
to
merely
require
a
stay
of
the
case,
or
a
suspension
of
the
case,
and
that
rule
says
two
things:
1)
what
is
at
issue
here,
which
is
that
the
case
goes
forward
once
the
defect
is
no
longer
present.
the
other
thing
that
it
says,
which
is
not
present
here,
is
that
even
at
the
time
the
defect
is
present,
dismissal
is
not
required,
mere
suspension
will
do,
and
i
should
note
that
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case,
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
did.
it
reversed
a
court
of
claims
dismissal
of
the
case
and
ordered
the
court
of
claims
merely
to
suspend
the
proceeding
while
another
case
in
district
court
was
proceeding.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right.
i
think
all
that
that
language
does
is
make
clear
that
there
is
an
impropriety
in
the
original
filing,
or
the
prosecution.
two
questions
would
remain.
one
is
merely
suspending
the
case,
does
that
mean
it's
still
being
prosecuted
if
there
are
no
litigation
burdens
being
imposed
on
the
government,
and
the
other
question
is,
what
would
be
the
remedy
for
a
filing
violation?
as
to
both,
i
think,
the
case
would
still
be
proper,
that
mere
suspension
would
be
required.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
if--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--if
the
filing
took
place
at
a
time
when
the
statutory
condition
was
met,
then
the
statute
was
violated
at
that
time.
let
me
just
refer,
finally,
to
the
arguments
in
our
briefs
for
both
nonretroactivity
and
equitable
tolling
in
the
event
this
court
adopts
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation,
both
of
which
rest
on
the
fundamental
unfairness
of
overruling
settled
law
more
than
a
decade
into
this
litigation
and
depriving
keene
of
any
day
in
court
on
its
claims
against
the
government.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
make
two
points,
one
about
reliance
interests,
and
one
about
the
effect
of
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation.
the
first
is
that
keene
certainly
relied
on
what
was
a
clear
rule,
whatever
the
type
of
relief,
in
separately
filing
its
tort
and
contract
actions.
so
did
the
government.
the
government
in
1980
initially
made
a
motion
under
1500
and
then,
for
tactical
reasons,
according
to
its
own
attorney,
withdrew
the
motion.
the
second
point:
a
stay
takes
care
of
any
government
interest
in
avoiding
or
securing
the
benefits
of
collateral
estoppel,
and
there
can't
be
any
claim
that
the
government
has
no
way
of
becoming
aware
of
other
suits.
even
if
its
own
internal
mechanisms
don't
provide
that
awareness,
all
it
need
do
after
the
filing
of
an
action
is
submit
an
interrogatory
and
ask
if
any
other
actions
are
proceeding.
so
concerns
about
multiple
overlapping
litigation...
not
merely
litigation
of
exactly
the
same
claim,
but
overlapping
related
litigation
that
might
involve
certain
similar
issues,
are
simply
not
what
justifies
federal--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--let
me
make
two
points.
first,
on
the
has
pending
question,
that's
a
separate
line
of
authority
under
which
it
was
absolutely
clear
and
without
any
kind
of
dispute
that
once
the
other
suit
was
over,
the
court
of
claims
action
proceeds.
we
win
our
case
under
that
exception
without
regard
to
the
scope
of
claim.
as
to
the
scope
of
claim,
casman
enunciated
a
principle
that
said
if
different
types
of
relief
are
sought,
they're
not
the
same
claim
because
the
cases
have
to
be
brought
in
different
forums.
it
then
extended
that
principle
to
its
natural
scope.
whenever
two
different
claims
had
to
be
brought
in
different
forums,
they
were
not
the
same,
and
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
in
which
it
was
restricted
to
claims
involving
different
types
of
relief.
