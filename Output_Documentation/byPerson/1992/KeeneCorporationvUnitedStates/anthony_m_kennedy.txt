but
would
that
interpretation
that
you've
just
explained
have
satisfied
the
congressional
concern
with
the
cotton
litigation
that
prompted
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
taranto,
the
tucker
act
has
a
rather
unusual
formulation.
it
says
that
the
court
of
claims
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment
in
any
case,
rather
than
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
a
case.
does
anything
turn
on
that?
it
does
seem
to
help
you
in
that
it
speaks
toward
the
jurisdiction
at
the
end
of
the
case,
but
it's
a
little
odd
to
talk
about
jurisdiction
at
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
then
do
we
explain
its
authority
at
the
outset?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
your
view
prevails,
may
the
government
collaterally
attack
final
judgments
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
this
new
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
a
judgment
that
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
void,
and
if
that
issue
has
at
least
not
been
litigated
or
raised
by
the
parties,
it's
open
to
you
to
attack
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
certainly
do
not
negate
the
possibility,
i
take
it.
