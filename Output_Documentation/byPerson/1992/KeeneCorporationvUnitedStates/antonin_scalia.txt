justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
was
after
the
ca
fed's
change
of
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
i
thought
newman-green
was
sort
of,
if
not
a
dodo
bird,
at
least
an
exception.
i
thought
the
normal
rule
was
otherwise,
that
if
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
at
the
outset,
you
can't
patch
it
up
later.
do
you
know
any
other
situation,
other
than
newman-green,
in
which
we've
allowed
absence
of
jurisdiction
to
be...
jurisdiction
that
did
not
exist
at
the
outset
of
the
case
to
be
remedied
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
if
i'm
not
a
citizen
of
a
diverse
state
and
then
later
move
to
a
diverse
state
the
suit
becomes
retroactively
validated?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
diversity
suit,
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i...
that's
all
i'm
saying.
i
always
assumed
that
the
traditional
rule
looked
to
the
outset
of
litigation,
and
that
newman-green
was
noteworthy
because
it
was
an
exception
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
wasn't
the
original
language
of
this...
i
can't
find
it
in
the
briefs...
wasn't
it
bring
or
prosecute?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
doesn't
that
cut
against
the
interpretation
that
you're
giving.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
was
changed
but
without
any
indication
that
the
change
was
meant
to
be
a
substantive
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
same,
you'd
have
to
say,
though,
that
the
statute
was
violated
at
some
point,
but
you'd
just
say,
bygones
are
bygones.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
violated
when
it
was
brought,
but
it's
no
longer
being
brought,
it's
only
being
prosecuted,
and
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
at
the
time
that
keene
1
was
filed,
the
only
suit
then
pending
was
the
single
action,
which
you
said...
the
counterclaim
that
you
said
could
be...
or
the
cross-claim
that
you
said
could
be
used
as
a
stalking
horse,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
involved
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
involved
one
single
action--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
now,
would
that
have
precluded
suit
in
the
claims
court
on
the
other
999,
or
9,999
actions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
involve
the
same
cause
of
action,
even
remotely.
it's
a
totally
different
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
common
nucleus?
i
don't
feel
it
arises
out
of
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact
at
all.
the
government
did
one
thing
in
one
contract,
and
it
happened
to
do
the
same
thing
in
a
totally
different
contract.
why
is
that
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
seems
to
me...
it's
a
common
legal
issue,
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
the
same
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
collateral
estoppel
goes
issue
by
issue.
you
can
have
a
lot
of
issues
involved
in
a
single
claim,
so
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
you'd
be
collaterally
estopped
as
to
certain
issues
in
one
claim
necessarily
means
that
for
purposes
of
this
statute
it's
the
same
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
if
it
involves
any
issue
that's
involved
in
that...
if
the
other
suit
involves
any
issue
that
is
involved
in
that
claim,
that
would
be
collateral
estoppel
as
to
that
claim
it
is
in--
