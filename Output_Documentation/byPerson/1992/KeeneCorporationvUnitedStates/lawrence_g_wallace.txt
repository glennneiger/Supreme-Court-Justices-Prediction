mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
of
section
1500
speaks
in
the
language
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
unmistakably
excludes
a
certain
category
of
cases
from
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
federal
claims.
that
court's
sole
function
is
to
hear
claims
against
the
united
states
for
monetary
awards
and
occasionally
certain
ancillary
relief.
these
are
claims
against
the
sovereign,
and
just
as
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
to
be
strictly
construed,
an
express
exclusion
from
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
congress
has
enacted
should
be
fairly
construed
to
accomplish
its
purpose
of
restricting
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
much
of
the
argument
that
has
been
made
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
claims
that
congress
has
authorized
might
be
foreclosed
by
this
provision
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
provision
is
an
exclusion
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
to
the
extent
this
provision
applies,
the
claims
are
not
authorized
against
the
united
states.
from
the
beginning
in
1868,
when
the
predecessor
statute
was
enacted,
the
central
purpose
was
clear,
and
that
was
to
prevent
simultaneous
litigation
of
related
claims.
the
cotton
claimants
were
unable
to
bring
the
two
categories
of
claims
the
congress
focused
on
in
the
same
court.
that's
the
common
sense
of
it.
petitioner
has
theorized
about
whether
it
could
have
brought...
whether
those
claimants
could
have
brought
the
cases
in
the
same
court
if
the
claims
against
the
federal
officers
could
have
been
brought
against
the
united
states,
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
doing
that
at
that
time.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
not
enacted
until
1946.
so
from
the
beginning
it
was
recognized
that
the
paradigm
class
of
cases
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
apply
to
were
cases
in
which
related
claims
had
to
be
brought
in
two
different
courts,
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
certainly
was
the
practical
reason
why
most
of
those
cases
were
brought
outside
of
washington,
but
if
they
had
been
brought
in
washington,
it
could
not
have
been
in
the
court
of
claims,
which
would
not
have
had
jurisdiction
over
suits
against
the
officers.
in
those
days,
the
officers
had
to
be
sued
in
their
individual
capacity
for
having
committed
a
tort
while
they
were
supposedly
conducting
their
official
duties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
so.
they
would
have
had
to
be
brought
in
the
district
court
here,
rather
than
in
the
court
of
claims,
so
from
its
outset
it
was
recognized
that
it
applied
to
force
claimants
to
choose
between--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--two
different
claims...
related
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was...
they
were
being
sued
on
the
same
basic
set
of
facts,
but
the
judgment--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
correct.
it
would
be
paid
by
someone
different.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
least
for
purposes
of
paying
judgments,
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
one
significant
change
that
was
made
in
the
statute
was
made
to
carry
this
function
forward
after
the
enactment
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
1946,
in
which
these
suits,
the
tort
claims
that
formally
had
to
be
made
against
officers
could
now
be
made
against
the
united
states,
and
so
in
the
1948
addition
of
the
judicial
code,
as
the
revisers
redrafted
this,
they
added
suits
against
the
united
states
in
any
other
court
to
the
original
language
that
referred
only
to
suits
against
officers
in
any
other
court,
so
the
substance
was
being
carried
forward.
in
fact,
the
revisers'
note
said
this
was
nothing
but
a
change
in
phraseology,
but
the
substance
of
precluding
putting
the
government
to
simultaneous
defense
of
the
tort
suit
in
the
district
court
and
the
claim
in
the
then
court
of
claims
was
carried
forward.
the
plaintiff
could
not
force
that
choice
upon
the
government.
now,
in
the
rehearing
petition
that
the
government
filed
in
this
case
in
the
federal
circuit,
i
think
the
government
articulated
two
important,
telling
points
that
i
believe
led
the
court
in
the
federal
circuit
to
reexamine
its
series
of
precedents
in
this
matter.
the
first
point
that
i
want
to
recount
to
the
court
has
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
and
why
the
rule
applied
to
the
situation
that
keene
had
presented
to
the
court,
and
as
the
government
put
it
in
the
rehearing
petition,
the
rule
propounded
by
the
panel
whereby
if
the
claimant
dismissed
its
district
court
case
before
the
court
of
federal
claims
ruled
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
then
it
would
have
been
all
right
for
the
two
suits
to
go
forward
simultaneously,
one
of
the
alternative
grounds
proposed
by
petitioner
today.
what
we
said
in
the
rehearing
petition
was,
the
rule
propounded
by
the
panel
would
permit
a
claimant
to
tie
up
government
resources
in
two
courts
simultaneously
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
while
the
claimant
continues
to
assess
its
relative
chances
of
recovery
in
one
forum
or
the
other.
as
long
as
the
claimant
bails
out
of
the
district
court
before
the
claims
court
actually
rules
on
the
section
1500
motion,
the
claimant
can
do,
as
plaintiffs
did
here,
precisely
what
congress
intended
to
preclude.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
suit
that
was
initially
pending
in
the
district
court
was
a
third-party
complaint
against
the
united
states
involving
just
one
of
these
asbestos
claims,
but
we
have
to
be
aware
that
even
though
the
suit
in
the...
later
brought
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
against
the
government
was
an
omnibus
suit
involving
many
similar
claims,
we
have
to
be
aware
that
modern
rules
of
collateral
estoppel
would
allow
an
individual
suit
of
that
sort
to
be
used
as
a
stalking
horse,
and
if
it
looked
as
if
that
suit
would
succeed,
it
could
go
forward
and
then
be
used
for
its
possible
collateral
estoppel
effect
against
the
government
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
stauffer
chemical
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
could
happen
if
both
courts
are
aware
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
once
there
was
an
awareness--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
government
is
not
always
aware
of
the
overlap
of
these
claims
promptly,
and
this...
you
know,
even
though
there
may
be
other
remedies
that
the
government
could
turn
to
now,
and
there
certainly
are
arguments
that
have
been
put
to
congress
and
that
will
continue
to
be
put
to
congress
about
whether
section
1500
should
be
repealed
or
revised,
the
fact
is
congress
proposed
a
remedy
of
barring
initially,
it
said,
the
plaintiff
from
filing
or
prosecuting
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
now
it
says
that
the
court
of
claims
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
if
there
is
a
suit
pending
on
a
related
claim
in
any
other
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
possibility
has
been
raised
in
some
briefs
amicus
curiae.
we
have
not
thus
far
attempted
to
do
that.
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
situation
in
a
case,
and
whether
it
would
come
within
the
federal
circuit's
rules
for
collateral
attacks
within
2
years
of
the
judgment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
there
are
rules
of
repose,
and
under
the
federal
circuit's
rules,
that
kind
of
challenge
has
to
be
raised
within
2
years
of
the
judgment,
it's
my
understanding.
i
can't
say
that
i've
focused
in
detail
on
that
question.
i
do
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
could
not
do
that,
mr.
justice.
that
remains
for
determination
in
future
litigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
second
point
in
the
rehearing
petition
was
that
the
rule
adopted
by
the
panel
in
focusing
on
the
time
that
the
motion
was
ruled
on
was
logically
inconsistent
with
one
of
the
exceptions
that
the
old
court
of
claims
had
developed
to
section
1500,
the
so-called
tecon
exception,
which
focused
exclusively
on
the
time
of
filing
complaints
and
said
that
so
long
as
the
complaint
is
filed
first
in
the...
what
was
then
the
claims
court,
and
then
is
filed
in
the
district
court,
it's
all
right
for
both
cases
to
go
ahead
simultaneously.
it's
only
if
another
suit
was
already
pending
in
a
district
court
when
the
claim
was
filed
in
the
old
court
of
claims
that
1500
would
be
applied,
and
our
point
was
that
there
was
a
logical
inconsistency
between
these
two
doctrines,
and
we
could
not
say
that
either
of
them
was
consistent
with
the
language
or
purpose
of
section
1500
and
therefore
we
agreed
with
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
mayer
on
the
panel
that
the
court
might
be
well
advised
to
review
its
precedents
under
1500
altogether,
because
they
had
strayed
so
far
from
the
language
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
an
exclusion
of
jurisdiction
only
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
that
is
what
it
in
terms
does.
it
provides
an
exception
to
any
jurisdiction
the
court
of
federal
claims
otherwise
would
have
if
these
related
claims
are
pending.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--possibly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
both
our
position
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
in
this
case,
which
held
that
keene's
suit
was
barred
and
did
not
come
within
any
of
the
established
exceptions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
arises
from
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
effect,
even
though
it's
only
a
particle
of
that
nucleus.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
particular
one
was
among
the
hundreds
that
were
brought
before
the
court
of
federal
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
common
legal
issue
between
the
same
parties,
and
it
also
is
a
common
issue
with
respect
to
the
same
facts,
and
if
you
can
break
away
individual
ones
into
other
courts,
you're
in
a
situation
where
the
government
could
be
subjected
to
collateral
estoppel
effect.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
stauffer
chemical
case,
where
the
company
had
first
sued
to
quash
a
warrant
to
inspect
its
facility
in
wyoming
and
had
prevailed
in
the
10th
circuit,
and
then
when
the
government
attempted
to
enforce
a
similar
warrant
with
private
contractors
to
enforce
a
facility
of
the
same
company
in
tennessee,
this
court
held
that
the
company,
because
it
was
the
same
parties,
the
company
was
entitled
to
collateral
estoppel
benefit
of
that
judgment.
so
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
co-extensive
claim
initially
really
doesn't
change
that.
of
course--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
it's
a
claim
in
respect
to.
it's...
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
of
any
claim
for
or
in
respect
to
which
the
plaintiff
has
pending
in
any
other
court
any
suit
or
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
in
respect
to,
because
we
have
to
worry
about
defending
against
it,
because
it
could
be
used
against
us
in
the
claim
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
were
it
not
for
the
bar,
the
jurisdictional
bar.
now,
it
happens
that
in
this
case
shortly
after
filing
the
initial
suit
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
the
petitioners
then
filed
their
omnibus
tort
action
in
new
york,
so
to
the
extent
the
court...
the
federal
circuit
was
correct
in
repudiating
the
tecon
rule
now,
that
issue
would
wash
out
of
the
case
in
any
event.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
true.
i'm
using
the
collateral
estoppel
point
to
show
why
it
is
in
respect
to
the
same
claim
that's
pending
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
even
though
the
one
is
just
a
particle
of
the
nucleus
of
operative
fact
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
an
omnibus
suit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
has
not
been
expressed
in
any
case
that
i'm
aware
of.
this
case
is
unusual
factually--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
the
two
claims
are
not
just
an
individual's
particular
claim
against
the
government
brought
in
two
courts,
but
in
the
one
case
it
was
an
individual
claim
and
in
the
other
it's
an
omnibus
bringing
together
of
hundreds
of
claims,
including
that
one,
so
the
facts
as
they
happen
to
arise
in
this
case
were
peculiar,
but
i
do
think
it
significant
that
while
petitioner
is...
concern
and
complains
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
reexamined
some
precedents
that
existed,
and
they
were
not
precedents
of
this
court,
as
the
chief
justice
rightly
has
pointed
out,
they
were
only
precedents
of
the
old
court
of
claims,
that
both
the
claims
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
any
of
them
properly
applied
to
keene's
case
to
begin
with.
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
in
this
case.
that
is
also
the
understanding
of
those
precedents
by
the
federal
circuit
expressed
in
the
johns-manville
case
that
preceded
this
one.
petitioner
takes
a
generous,
and
we
think
an
unwarrantedly
generous
view
of
one
line
of
these
exceptions
called
the
casman
exception,
which
had
generally
been
understood
to
apply
when
the
kind
of
relief
sought
in
the
court
other
than
the
court
of
federal
claims
was
different
in
nature
from
a
monetary
award.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it
did
not.
it
could
have
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
on
the
narrower
grounds
that
that
court
used,
but
keene
and
the
other
parties
that
were
before
the
federal
circuit
that
did
not
pursue
their
cases
to
this
court,
were
arguing
for
a
broadening
of
some
of
the
established
exceptions,
and
i
think
it
was
within
the
proper
functioning
of
the
federal
circuit
for
them
to
consider
whether,
before
broadening
any
of
these
exceptions,
the
exceptions
were
sound
to
begin
with,
and
this
has
been
hardly
a
new
question.
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
the
leading
article
on
the
subject,
what
is
still
the
leading
article
on
the
subject,
which
was
published
in
the
georgetown
law
journal
and
it's
cited
in
the
briefs
on
both
sides,
back
in
march
of
1967,
shortly
after
each
of
the
major
three
lines
of
exceptions
had
been
established,
the
author...
the
editors
of
the
georgetown
law
review
summarized
the
author's
thesis
as
follows,
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
for
a
moment,
because
it's
the
final
sentence
of
this
summary
that
is
the
most
telling
for
our
purposes,
and
i'm
speaking
of
this
article
by
david
schwartz
that
is
cited--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
but
i
think
that
it
shows
that
the
problems
with
these
exceptions
were
well-known
both
to
the
judges
and
to
practitioners
and
had
caused
considerable
disuse
of
the
statute,
but
if
i
may
just
quote
the
editor's
summary,
"after
a
careful
discussion
of
the
historical
background
and
judicial
construction
of
section
1500,
mr.
schwartz
concludes
that
the
statute
no
longer
serves
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
enacted.
"
"he
argues
that
the
tortured
constructions
made
of
the
statute
in
efforts
to
reach
equitable
results
in
spite
of
its
wording
have
resulted
in
such
confusion
that
it
is
no
longer
possible
for
the
practitioner
to
ascertain
what
the
statute
means.
"
"in
light
of
these
developments,
mr.
schwartz
urges
the
repeal
of
the
section
and
substitution
of
a
rule
of
res
judicata.
"
that
is
rather
close
to
the
principal
submission
being
made
by
the
petitioner
to
this
court,
although
obviously
the
author
of
the
article
at
least
thought
that
it
would
require
repeal
of
the
statute
to
reach
the
result
that
is
being
advocated
to
this
court,
and
that
was
the
issue
that
was
considered
in
the
recent
1992
hearings
in
which
senator
heflin's
bill
to
repeal
the
statute
was
not
adopted
by
the
committee.
there
was
advocacy
of
its
repeal
as
well
as
the
statement
opposing
repeal
by
the
department
of
justice
that
my
colleague
adverted
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
the
repeal
provision.
all
that
got
out
of
committee
was
changing
the
language
again
to
reflect
the
new
name
of
the
court
of
federal
claims,
if
i
can
keep
up
with
this.
now,
it
is
also
significant
that
several
of
the
briefs
amicus
curiae
that
are
nominally
supporting
the
petitioner
in
this
case
say
relatively
little
about
why
the
petitioner
should
prevail,
and
their
chief
point
is
that
the
court
of
federal...
that
the
federal
circuit
needlessly
reached
the
question
of
whether
the
casman
exception
should
be
repudiated,
because
this
is
not
a
case
within
the
casman
exception.
and
that
is
the
view
that
the
federal
circuit
had
in
the
johns-manville
case
as
well,
and
these
amici
are
concerned
about
the
repudiation
of
the
casman
exception.
they
did
not
understand
the
casman
exception
to
cut
as
broadly
as
petitioner
claims
it
cut.
they
understood
it
the
way
we
in
the
federal
circuit
understood
it,
to
apply
only
if
a
different
form
of
relief
were
being
sought,
injunctive
relief,
for
example,
in
the
district
court,
while
monetary
damages
were
being
sought
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
and
here
it
was
essentially
the
same
monetary
award
that
was
being
sought
in
both
courts.
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
about
equitable
tolling,
which
we
do
not
think
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case
because
petitioner,
with
notice
of
this
statute,
deliberately
decided
to
pursue
its
monetary
claims
in
three
different
district
courts
as
well
as
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
right.
they
cite,
basically,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
only
one
aberrational
order
of
the
federal
circuit
in
support
of
their
broader
view
that
the
casman
exception
really
meant
that
if
you
had
to
litigate
in
two
separate
courts
it
was
all
right
to
litigate
both
suits,
but
that
is
what
the
situation
of
the
cotton
claimants
was,
and
that
was
not
our
understanding,
the
federal
circuit's
understanding,
or
the
understanding
of
various
amici,
of
the
scope
of
the
casman
exception.
my
time
has
expired.
