mr.
bruce
donald
willis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
court
properly
issued
both
legislative
and
congressional
redistricting
plans
for
minnesota
in
february
of
1992.
and
the
appellees
believe
that
this
court
may
determine
that
issue
on
the
basis
of
the
application
of
principles
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
doctrines
of
federal
court
abstention
without
having
to
determine
whether
the
federal
court's
finding
of
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
clearly
erroneous,
if
this
court
so
chooses,
because
in
issuing
its
plans,
the
federal
court
indicated
that
it
was
affording
the
same
relief
that
it
would
have
afforded
had
it
not
found
a
section
2
voting
rights
act
violation.
and
appellees
further
believe
that
such
a
determination
of
this
matter
may
be
made
by
this
court
without
disturbing
any
precedents
of
the
court.
and
first
of
all,
this
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions
in
cases
such
as
colorado
river
that
a
federal
court
has
a
virtually
unflagging
duty
adjudicate
matters
before
it.
the
federal
court
in
this
case
had
jurisdiction,
and
it
was
obligated
to
adjudicate
the
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
before
it.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
don't
view,
although
i
will
have
to
admit,
chief
justice,
that
the...
we
bought
into
the
language
used
by
the
appellants
describing
scott
v.
germano
as
an
abstention
case.
it
properly
read
is
not
an
abstention
case.
it
is
a
deferral
case,
but
quite
clearly,
this
court
told
the
federal
court
in
illinois
in
that
case
that
it
should
retain
jurisdiction.
abstention,
as
i
read
that
term,
means--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--i'm
not...
i
think
that
scott
v.
germano
is
an
anomaly,
and
it
is,
as
this
court
knows,
a
case
that
arose
as
part
of
the
spate
of
decisions
across
the
country
that
followed
baker
v.
carr
and
reynolds
v.
sims
when
virtually
every
redistricting
plan
in
the
country
was
rendered
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
think
the
case
has
to
be
read
that
way,
but
it
also
has
to
be
recognized
that
that
case
was
brought
2
years
in
advance
of
an
election,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
provides
very
efficient
guidance
for
federal
courts
today
operating
under
the
kinds
of
time
constraints
that
mr.
tunheim
has
described.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
don't
think
the
federal
court
reviews
the
state
court
plan
on
the
merits,
but
i
think
the
federal
court
has
an
obligation
to
adjudicate
the
claims
that
are
before
it
no
matter
what
the
state
court
has
done.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
even
if
it
reaches
a--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--even
if
it
reaches
a
result
in
conflict
with
the
court
on
the
same
issues.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
it
strikes
me,
your
honor,
that
this
court
in
its
decision
in
new
orleans
public
service
3
years
ago
rather
strongly
stated
that
abstention
principles...
the
younger
abstention
principle
that
has
been
argued
for
application
here
in
this
case
does
not
require
abstention
in
deference
to
a
state
judicial
proceeding
reviewing
legislative
or
executive
action.
the
court
went
on
to
say...
and
i
quote...
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
the
federal
court's
disposition
of
such
a
case
may
well
affect
or
for
practical
purposes
preempt
a
future
or
even
a
pending
state
court
action,
but
there
is
no
doctrine
that
the
availability
or
even
the
pendency
of
state
judicial
proceedings
excludes
the
federal
court.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
said
that
the...
in
my
judgment
the
federal
court
could
reach
an
inconsistent
conclusion.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
justice
scalia,
we
are...
in
this
particular
instance,
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court,
having
simultaneous
jurisdiction,
you
know,
had
claims
before
it.
the
federal
court
had
no...
the
state
court
had
arrived
at
no
conclusion.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
your
honor,
it's--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--well,
thank
you,
your
honor,
but--
[laughter]
if
we
were
talking
about
res
judicata
and
preclusive
effect,
i
mean,
that...
in
this...
if
you're
talking
about
the
facts
of
this
case
as
opposed
to
an
abstract
legal
principle,
in
this
case
there
were
different
parties.
the
parties
in
the
federal
court
were
not
the...
all
parties
to
the
state
action.
all
of
the
appellants
here
were
parties
to
both
actions.
in
fact,
three
of
the
appellants
voluntarily
intervened
in
the
federal
action
having
been
parties
to
the
state
action,
so
that
the
state
court
determination
here
did
not
have,
in
our
judgment,
preclusive
effect
on
the
parties
to
the
federal
action.
i
misunderstood
your
question
and
thought
you
were
speaking
in
the...
in
a
more
abstract
manner.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
your
honor,
we
would
not
concede
that.
first
of
all...
and
let
me
correct
a
misapprehension
that
may
exist.
the
question
was
asked
earlier
if
the
federal
court
had
established
a
deadline
by
which
not
only
the
legislature,
but
by
which
state
actions
had
to
be
taken.
the
federal
court
did
so
in
an
order
on
october
4,
1991
in
which
it
established
january
25,
1992
as
the
date
by
which
the
state
of
minnesota
shall
enact
both
legislative
and
congressional
redistricting
plans.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
it
depends
on
how
one
reads
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
it
could
be
read
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
that
is
arguable.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
no,
your
honor.
we
claim
that
it
was
not,
however,
entitled
to
deference
by
the
federal
court
because
it
was
not
a
legitimate
legislative
enactment
entitled
to
deference.
it
was
not
reflective
of
state
policy
because
it
was
in
all...
it
was
virtually
identical
to
a
plan
that
was
specifically
rejected
as
state
policy
1
month
later.
we
have
the
unusual
circumstance
here
of
having
a
state
judicial
plan
ordered
1
month
before
the
legislature
reconvened
to
attempt
to...
you
know,
to
pass
a
legislative
redistricting
plans.
we
have
a
judicial
proceeding
before
the
legislative
action.
the
legislature
attempted
to
adopt
in
january
of
1992
a
plan
that
but
for
two
senate
districts
was
identical
to
the
plan
the
state
court
had
ordered
in
december,
and
that
was
specifically
rejected
as
state
policy
in
minnesota
by
virtue
of
the
governor's
veto
and
this
court's--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--the
state
court
adopted
plan--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--still
exists.
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
we
argue
that
it
is
not
a
reflection
of
state
policy
in
that
it
was
virtually
identical
with
the
plan
that
was
specifically
rejected
as
state
policy.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
well--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--except
this
court
has
announced
that
in
minnesota
specifically
in
dealing
with
redistricting
specifically
in
the
smiley
v.
holm
case
that
state
policy
in
minnesota
is
reflected
by
valid
legislative
enactments,
and
that
in
minnesota
the
governor,
as
the
chief
executive
officer,
is
a
necessary
element
for
a
valid
legislative
enactment
to
occur.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
would
disagree,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
think
that
state
policy,
at
least
in
minnesota,
is
reflected
by...
is
found
in
judicial
enactments.
state
policy
in
minnesota
is
found
in
the
valid
enactments
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
think
that
is
correct.
and
first
of
all,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
greater
reason
for
a
federal
court
to
abstain
in
a
matter
involving
voting
rights
than
in
a
case
involving
any
other
basic
civil
rights.
and
no
one
i
think
would
suggest
seriously
that
because
there
was
a
state
forum
available,
that
an
individual
challenging
discriminatory
educational
practices
or
prison
conditions
or
whatever
could
not
have
access
to
a
federal
forum
even
though
the
state
has
a
strong
state
interest
in
matters
of
that
kind.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
that.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
that
because
germano
is...
does
not
tell
federal
courts
to
abstain,
but
i
think
germano--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--it
tells
them
to
stay
their
hand,
but
it
doesn't
tell
them
to...
you
know,
to
dismiss
the
case
because
there
is
a
pending
state
court
action.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
certainly
in
the
timeframe
involved
in
this
case,
deferral
was...
would
not
be
more
palatable
than
abstention,
but
the
court
should
recognize
what
the
federal
court
did
here.
not
only...
in
attempting
to
follow
the
dictates
of
germano,
it
established
first
january
20
and
later
january
25
as
the
date
by
which
state
action
had
to
occur.
no
one
objected
to
that.
all
of
the
parties
agreed
that
a
plan
should
be
in
effect
ideally
by
early
february,
at
latest
by
the
first
of
march.
the
federal
court
recognized
also
the
inherent
potential
for
delay
in
the
state
appellate
proceedings,
you
know,
indicated
that
because
it...
you
know,
it
was
going
to
give
the
legislature
an
opportunity
to
act.
if
the
legislature
did
not
make
good
on
its
representation
that
it
would
adopt
a
valid
plan
of
both
legislative
and
congressional
redistricting,
it
would
become
law
in
january.
the
federal
court
knew
it
wasn't
going
to
have
time
to
start
at
that
point
and
get
plans
done.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
well,
except
the
court
also
has
to
recognize
that
congress
has,
by
the
enactment
of
section
2284,
given
federal
courts
specifically
jurisdiction
over
statewide
legislative
apportionment,
as
well
as
congressional
apportionment,
because
they
are
both
specifically
mentioned
in
that
section.
it
also
provides
for
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
determination
of
the
three-judge
panel.
the
three-judge
panel
created
in
minnesota
was
not
created
under
any
statute
that
relates
to
redistricting.
it
was
an
ad
hoc
panel
created
by
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
state
supreme
court
to
move
judges
from
one
district
to
another.
since
it
was
not
created
pursuant
to
a
special
statute,
there
is
no
special
statute
regarding
appeal,
and
on
its
face,
the
determination
of
that
three-judge
panel
would
be
subject
to
minnesota's
two-tiered
appeal
process
and
then
possibly
to
this
court
after
determination
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
on
the...
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
judge
harriet
lansing
of
the
minnesota
court
of
appeals,
state
district
court
judge
william
walker
from
northwestern
minnesota,
and
state
district
court
judge
kenneth
maas
from
the
stillwater
area.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
stillwater
or
white
bear
lake.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
because
of
the
exigencies
of
the
political
processes
in
the
state,
you
know,
as
the
attorney
general
has
acknowledged.
it
is
essential
that
between
the
time
that
the
legislative
data
are
available
early
in
the
year
following
the
census
year,
that
the
redistricting
process
both
for
legislative
districts
and
for
congressional
districts
be
completed
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
processes
necessary
to
conduct
the
election
in
the
even
numbered
year
are
in
place.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
think
it
is
a
consideration,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
taken
together
wich
section
2284
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
such
cases
and
providing
for
immediate
and
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
from
the
determinations
of
three-judge
panels,
that
congress
has
evidenced
an
intention
that
there
be
quick
determination
of
redistricting
issues.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
the
federal
district
court
decree?
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
february
19.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
no,
but
if...
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
if
this
court
were
hearing
the
case
after
review
by
two
tiers
of
the
minnesota
appellate
process
and
possible
certiorari
from
the
determination
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
that
we
would
probably
be
sitting
here
at
this
time
next
year
or
certainly
sometime
very
much
later
than
this.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
if
you
had
an
identity
of
parties
involved.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
because
here,
your
honor,
in
dealing
with
redistricting,
this
court
has
said
that,
you
know,
the
courts
must
defer
to
state
policy,
you
know,
in
making
their
determinations
regarding
redistricting.
the
hypothetical
that
you
present
i
don't
perceive
as
having
state
policy
implications.
here
the
federal
court--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--here
the
federal
court
had
determined
that...
you
know,
by
the
time
it
acted
in
february,
i
mean,
it
had
a
number
of
facts
available
to
it.
it
knew
that
what
the
state
court
had
adopted
in
december
was
a
plan
that
under
minnesota
law,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
had
been
specifically
rejected
as
state
policy
in
january.
it
also
had
no
congressional
plan
of
any
kind
before
it.
the
legislature's
attempt
to
pass
a
legislative
plan
similarly
was
rejected
as
state
policy
by
the
veto
of
the
governor
in
january,
and
the
state
court
had
not
generated
a
congressional
plan.
and
i
would
take
issue
with,
by
the
way,
the
representation
that
in
any
way
stays
of
the
federal
court
contributed
to
that
circumstance.
as
mr.
tunheim
acknowledged,
in
its
december
9
order,
the
state
court
said
that
we
are
not
going
to
act
on
congressional
plans
now.
we're
going
to
give
the
legislature
a
chance
to
act
in
january
while
at
the
same
time
not
giving
them
a
chance
to
act
again
in
january
on
the
legislative
plans.
the
legislature
passed
a
congressional
redistricting
plan...
a
stay...
that
order
was
issued
subject
to
an
existing
stay
of
the
federal
panel.
the
legislature
passed
its
congressional
plan
on
the
9th
of
january.
the
governor
vetoed
it
in
the
10th
of
january.
this
court
vacated
the
stay
on
the
10th
of
january,
so
that
all
the
state
court
had
said
it
would
do
is
wait
till
the
legislature
attempted
to
act
by
the
10th
of
january,
it
was
known
what
was
going
to
happen,
and
by
the
10th
of
january
the
stay
of
the
federal
court
had
been
vacated
by
this
court.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
think
that
the
district...
absent
the
district
court
stay,
the
legislature
likely
would
not
have
attempted
to
act
on
legislative
redistricting.
i
think
the
district
court
legitimately
saw
the
issuance
of
a
legislative
redistricting
plan
a
month
before
the
legislature
was
scheduled
to
reconvene
to
consider
redistricting
as
having
a
chilling
effect
on
the
legislative
process
in
minnesota.
this
court,
obviously,
did
not
agree
that
the
stay
was
appropriate.
it
was
vacated
without
comment.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
choose
your
view,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
the
state
court?
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
think
the
court
itself
could
have
proceeded
with
the
development
of
contingency
plans
as
the
federal
court
had
done.
my
recollection
of
the
terms
of
the
stay
was
simply
that
no
action
could
be
taken
to
implement
such
a
plan
and
that
the
parties
themselves
were
enjoined
from
participating
in
further
proceedings
of
the
state
panel,
but
i
think
the
state
panel
itself
could
have
and
perhaps
did.
that
was
not
something
to
which
counsel
were
privy
as
i...
you
know,
it
may
have
been
working
on
contingency
plans.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
excuse
me,
no.
i
was
speaking
only
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
state
court
could
itself
have
proceeded
with
the
development
of
contingency
plans
subject
to
the
stay.
the
federal
court
prepared
contingency
plans
without...
strike
that.
the
federal
court
prepared
contingency
plans
which
were
not
to
be
made
public
until
and
unless
they
were
needed.
there
was
input
from
counsel.
from
the
outset
of
the
state
court
action,
the
state
court
concerned
itself
only
with
legislative
plans,
and
congressional
plans
were
not
even
mentioned
until
the
order
of
december
9
in
which
the
state
court
said
we
are
going
to
wait
until
the
legislature
has
an
opportunity
to
act
in
january.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
determination
of
the
federal
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous,
but
as
i--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--i
think
that's...
that
that
is
a
stretch,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
it
cannot
be.
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
i
think
that
the
federal
court
satisfied
itself
from
an
examination
of
voting
patterns
that
there
was
racial
block
voting--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--but
once
again,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
possible
for
this
panel
to
deal
with
the
issues
in
this
case
without
making
a
determination
of
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
the
section
2
voting
rights
act
violation,
and
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
do
so.
i
think
that
the
court
is
going
to
have
on
its
calendar
on
december
8
a
case
that
will
allow
the
court
to
address
those
same
issues,
and
i
don't
think...
i
think
that
this
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
the
grounds
of
the
application
of
principles
of
preclusion
and
that
in
this
case
the
state
court...
or
i
mean,
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction
and
obligation
to
act.
there
is
no
principle
of
abstention
that
would
require
them
not
to
act.
in
fact,
the
court's
pronouncements
have
been
to
the
contrary,
and
that
the
court
in
issuing
its
plans
of
legislative
and
congressional
redistricting
properly
exercised
its
broad
remedial
power
and
that--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--and
to
issue
an
injunction
to
protect
its
jurisdiction
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
its
order.
but
it...
i
mean,
it
issued
a
plan
that
complied
with
all
of
the
directions
of
this
court
regarding
court
ordered
plans
for
de
minimis
population
deviations.
it
avoided
the
fracturing
of
minority
voting
populations.
it
created
compact
districts.
it
was
drawn
without
consideration
of
the
residence
of
incumbents,
and
faced
with
several
alternatives
for
the
city
of
minneapolis
on
how
best
minority
voting
interests
be
protected,
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
court's
decision
to
create
a
super
majority-minority
senate
district
can
be
said
to
be
clearly--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--well,
i
think--
mr.
bruce
donald
willis
--because
the
stay
of
the
federal
court
determined
that
the
state
court
plan
was
not...
it
was
not
a
valid
reflection
of
state
policy
in
that
virtually
identical
plan
had
been
specifically
rejected
during
the
1992
legislative
session
in
january.
