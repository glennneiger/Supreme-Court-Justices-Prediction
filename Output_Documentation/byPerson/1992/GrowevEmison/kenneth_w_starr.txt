mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
focuses
on
a
different
aspect
of
the
proceedings
below,
namely
the
interpretation
of
the
voting
rights
act
by
the
district
court
and
specifically
section
2
as
amended
in
1982.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
do
not.
abstention
is
obviously
a
fact-intensive
inquiry.
the
principles
of
this
court
have,
obviously,
indicated
the
importance
of
state
procedures
and
that
this
is
a
state
function,
but
the
fact-intensive
nature
of
this
is
such
that
we
take
no
position.
our
focus
is
on
the
merits
portion
of
what
the
district
court
did,
its
interpretation
of
section
2,
and
our
submission
about
section
2
is
this,
that
the
language
of
section
2,
its
purpose,
and
the
underlying
logic
of
voter
dilution
claims
all
combine
to
suggest
that
the
preconditions
identified
by
this
court
in
the
gingles
case
should
apply
to
single
member
district
challenges
as
well
as
to
the
multimember
district
challenge
at
issue.
that
is
to
say
that
minority
plaintiffs
or
any
challenger
should
show
that
there
is
a
sufficiently
large,
geographically
compact
group
of
minority
voters
so
as
to
constitute
a
majority
within
a
particular
district,
and
then
that
the
voting
behavior
has
been
characterized
by
racial
polarization
on
the
part
of
both
minorities
and
then
a
white
voting
block
in
response.
above
all,
unless
there
is
racial
block
voting...
and
as
the
district
court
mentioned,
the
three-judge
majority
mentioned,
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
of
racial
polarization
here...
then
there
is
no
predicate
for
overturning
state
drawn
districts
on
a
dilution
claim.
if
we
look
to
what
the
voting
rights
act
was
intended
to
do
and
we
go
back
to
1982,
the
purpose
of
that
restoration
in
1982
was
to
codify
this
court's
decision
in
white
against
regester
and
a
wide
variety
of
lower
court
cases,
especially
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
some
23
cases
that
preceded
the
city
of
mobile
v.
bolden.
in
all
of
those
cases,
racial
block
voting
was
present,
and
when
we
focus
on
the
logic
of
a
dilution
claim,
unless
there
is
political
cohesiveness,
then
there
is
nothing
about
the
state's
electoral
structure
that
has
interfered
with
that.
not
only
in
those
cases
was
there
block
voting
on
the
part
of
minority
interests,
but
there
was
also
racial
block
voting
by
the
white
majority
that
had
the
effect
of
cancelling
out
or
of
submerging
the
minority
vote.
in
addition,
the
concept
of
geographic
compactness
is
closely
related
to
the
concept
of
what
an
electoral
district
is,
that
as
this
court
said
in
gingles,
unless
there
is
geographic
compactness
and
a
large
enough
group
to
constitute
a
majority
in
the
district,
then
a
defeat
at
the
polls
is
a
result
of
the
lack
of
numbers
and
not
because
of
the
kind
of
concerns
that
congress
was
getting
at
in
amending
section
2.
section
2
is
getting
at
the
deprivation
of
equal
opportunity
on
account
of
race
or
color.
it
is
not
getting
at
coalition
politics,
interest
group
politics.
it
is
getting
at
clearing
the
channels
of
politics,
of
the
obstacles
that
prevent
what
the
statute
calls
an
equal
opportunity
to
participate
while
guarding
against
the
danger
which
was
part
of
the
great
compromise
of
1982
of
analyzing
section
2
in
such
a
way
that
yields
up
essentially
powerful
tendencies
in
favor
of
proportional
representation.
we
believe
at
bottom
that
was
the
vision
that
was
guiding
the
district
court
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
conceivable,
it
seems
to
me
just
in
terms
of
the
orderly
administration
of
justice,
that
the
district
court
might
well
be
advised
to
look
to
the
record
of
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
case
assuming
that
it
had,
in
fact,
had
a
trial,
or
at
least
there
were
evidentiary
submissions
and
so
forth.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
again,
we
have
taken
no
position
at
all
on
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
primarily
because
of
the
inherently
fact-intensive
nature
of
these
proceedings.
that...
i
think
the
value...
when
we
look
at
scott
against
germano
and
what
this
court
was
trying
to
do,
i
think
the
court
was
essentially
saying
to
federal
courts
please
be
respectful
of
state
court
proceedings,
and
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
once
those
state
court
proceedings
are
under
way
there
is...
and,
in
fact,
what
happened
in
minnesota,
as
the
court
knows,
is
that
a
special
three-judge
court
was
impaneled
representing
different
parts
of
the
state
with
then
direct
appeal
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
from
all
that
appears,
although
we
have
no
specific
position
here,
it
appears
that
the
state
court
proceedings
were
going
forward
correctly.
now,
if
there
is
concerns
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
what
a
state
court
might,
in
fact,
do,
we
obviously
are
capable
of
intervening
and
participating
in
that
litigation.
and
obviously,
if
there
is
an...
ultimately
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
section
2
by
the
state
court
system,
that
obviously
suggests
that
an
appeal
would...
or
certiorari
might
be
appropriate
in
this
court.
the
present
dynamic
is
one
that
is
quite
frustrating
because
you
have
under
the
statute
these
three-judge
district
courts
across
the
country
with
direct
appeal
to
this
court,
and
at
the
same
time
you
have
this
phenomenon
of
the
parallel
state
proceedings.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
there
is
wisdom
in
the
profederalism
vision
of
scott
against
germano,
but
at
the
same
time,
we
have
not
taken
a
specific
position
in
terms
of
the
judgment
and
whether
it
would
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
protection.
back
to
section
2,
if
i
may,
just
for
a
moment.
it
does
seem
to
us
that
when
one
analyzes
the
three-judge
court's
opinion,
what
it
essentially
said
was
there
is
a
lack
of
proportional
representation,
and
the
bottom
line
and
what
the
court
did
there
was
to
create
a
new
district,
that
new
senate
district
59,
which
no
one
in
the
redistricting
process,
that
deliberative
process,
hearing
from
various
interested
groups
and
so
forth,
including
minority
groups,
no
one
had
been
recommending--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
the
contrary.
i
cannot
confess
intimate
familiarity
with
the
state
court
record,
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
state
court
itself
in
these
proceedings,
this
special
three-judge
court,
heard
evidence,
considered
this
very
point,
and
in
fact,
as
you'll
see
in
the
appellants'
brief,
there
is
evidence
quite
to
the
contrary
in
minnesota,
that
individuals,
minority
individuals,
have
been
elected
to
various
and
sundry
positions,
including
in
the
twin
cities
area,
from
overwhelmingly
majority
or
white
districts.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly
right.
i
think
what
judge
lay
and
his
colleague
did
on
the
district
bench
was
simply
cite
a
law
review
article.
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
in
gingles
said
cannot
be
done,
and
it's
also
what
the
senate
report
at
page
33
and
34
said
cannot
be
done.
we
don't
presume
racial
block
voting
in
this
country.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
the
answer
is,
i
am
informed,
no,
in
state
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
not
sure
that
there
was
in
the
congressional
area,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
an
appeal
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
take
no
position
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
thank
the
court.
