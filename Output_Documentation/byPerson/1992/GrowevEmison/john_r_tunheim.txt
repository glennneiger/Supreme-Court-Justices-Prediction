mr.
john
r.
tunheim
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
redistricting
is
a
power
and
responsibility
that
is
reserved
to
the
states
in
the
first
instance.
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
opportunity
to
illuminate
that
important
principle
and
clarify
the
apparent
confusion
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
i
intend
to
direct
my
argument
this
morning
to
the
abstention
issue:
did
the
federal
court
err
by
refusing
to
abstain
to
an
ongoing
state
judicial
proceeding?
and
the
case
presents
perhaps
one
of
the
most
stark
examples
of
what
can
go
wrong
when
there
are
jurisdictional
disputes
in
the
redistricting
process.
we
have
a
federal
court
that
has
twice
enjoined
an
ongoing
state
proceeding
and
enjoined
a
final
valid
judgment
of
a
state
court
and
wrote
redistricting
plans
that
absolutely
ignored
state
law.
and
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
proper
role
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
unique
context
of
the
decennial
responsibility
of
redrawing
the
election
districts
within
the
boundaries
of
the
states.
you
cannot
have
two
sets
of
rules,
one
drawn
by
the
state
and
one
by
the
federal
courts.
the
time
pressures
are
extraordinary.
there
must
be
a
rule
that
is
absolutely
clear
on
allocation
of
responsibilities
because
at
stake
are
really
the
vital
state
interests
that
are
involved
in
elections,
in
ensuring
the
integrity
of
election
districts
within
states,
and
at
stake
are
really
important
principles
of
federalism.
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
established
and
reaffirmed
a
bright
line
abstention
rule
to
be
followed
by
federal
courts
in
redistricting
cases.
the
rule
is
firmly
grounded
in
the
constitution
and
by
strong
policy
reasons.
adherence
to
the
rule
would
have
eliminated
the
costly,
wasteful,
and
duplicative
proceedings
that
we
had
in
this
matter.
now,
any
discussion
of
the
abstention
rule
must
start
by
reemphasizing
what
is
unique
about
the
redistricting
process.
it
is
an
inherent
state
function.
this
court
has
emphasized
that
federal
courts...
emphasized
over
and
over
that
federal
courts
must
defer
to
state
legislatures
to
accomplish
the
redistricting
task,
and
even
when
federal
courts
do
act,
they
must
adhere
and
defer
to
state
policies
that
have
been
developed.
this
deference
principle
i
believe
is
at
the
heart
of
the
abstention
doctrine
for
redistricting
cases.
now,
this
rule
is
limited
to
a
relatively
narrow
window
for
the
redistricting
process,
the
roughly
10
months
or
so
that
states
have
after
receipt
of
the
census
data
and
when
they
have
to
have
district
plans
in
place
to
run
the
first
election
after
that
time.
if
there
is
a
redistricting
challenge
in
state
courts,
if
there
is
such
a
challenge,
the
federal
court
should
abstain
in
favor
of
the
state
court
action
just
as
it
must
defer
to
the
legislature.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
it...
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
the
federal
court
should
under
the
rule
retain
jurisdiction
to
ensure
that
all
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
are
adhered
to
by
the
state
in
the
process.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
federal
court
in
this
case,
your
honor,
set
a
timetable
for
the
legislature
to
act.
the
federal
court
throughout
the
process
ignored--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--for
the
legislature
to
act
on
congressional
and
legislative
redistricting.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
federal
court
did
not
set
a
deadline
for
the
state
court
because
it
essentially
ignored
the
state
court
throughout
the
process.
it
found
properly
that
it
must
defer.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
election
tomorrow
is
being
operated
pursuant
to
the
stay
of
this
court.
legislative
districts
will
be,
by
virtue
of
the
state
court
plan
which--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--but
congressional
districts
by
the
federal.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
take
any
action
with
respect
to
the
election
tomorrow.
the
principle
that
we
are
urging
on
the
court
is
that
the
federal
court
must
abstain
in
favor
of
a
state
court,
and
in
this
case
we
had
a
state
court
that
had
an
ongoing
proceeding
with
respect
to
congressional
redistricting.
in
fact,
in...
at
the
later
stage
of
the
process
after
it
had
been
enjoined
several
times,
it
finally
issued
a
plan.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
relief
that
we're
asking
with
respect
to
congressional
districts
is
that
the
federal
court
decision
be
reversed
and
the
matter
be
left
for
the
state
court
to
complete
the
process
of
congressional
district
that
it...
congressional
redistricting
that
it
worked
on
throughout
the
year.
so,
in
other
words,
for
the
1994
elections,
they
would
be
run
pursuant
to
a
plan
drawn
by
the
state
court
or
the
state
legislature
if
it
chooses
to
pass
a
plan,
but
it
would
not
impact
the
1992
elections
at
all.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes,
it
would,
justice
white,
but
the
state
court
panel
was
proceeding
in
view
of
a
valid--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--absolutely.
the
important
principle
is
that
all
courts
must
defer
to
the
legislature.
the
legislature
in
this
instance
was
unable
to
pass
a
congressional
plan
that
was
signed
by
the
governor,
and
so
the
state
court
proceeded
to
draw
a
congressional
redistricting
plan.
and
it
would
be
that
plan
that
we
would
urge
the
court
to
allow
to
go
into
effect
to
recognize
the
power
and
the
responsibility
of
the
state
judiciary
to
address
these
issues
under
the
abstention
rule.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
what
this
court
in
germano
suggested,
that
the
federal
court
retain
jurisdiction
and
fix
a
reasonable
time
by
which
the
state
must
complete
the
process
in
order
to
avoid
federal
intervention.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's
correct.
and
i
believe
that's
a
reasonable
administration
of
justice
rule
because
administration
of
justice
is
an
important
concern
in
redistricting
matters,
especially
with
the
very
quick
time
line
that
must
follow.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
state
court
was
proceeding.
it,
in
fact,
entered
a
final
valid
judgment
on
legislative
redistricting.
it
was
deferring
to
the
legislature
to
give
the
legislature
an
opportunity
to
pass
a
congressional
plan
in
january
of
1992,
and--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--no.
the
federal
court
set
a
deadline
of
january
20
for
the
legislature,
but
the
federal
court
did
not
set
a
deadline
for
the
state
to
complete
the
process.
their
deadline
applied
only
to
the
legislature.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
but
for...
well,
for
legislative
redistricting
and
congressional
redistricting,
both
of
which
are
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
draw
lines
if
they
can
accomplish
that
task.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes,
january
20,
the
same
date--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--the
state
court
was
proceeding
through
the
process--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--the
state
court
did
adhere
to
that
date.
yes,
it
did.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
the
state
court
was
prepared
to
review
any
congressional
plan
that
the
legislature
would
have
passed.
it
had
already--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
it
was
waiting
until
the
legislature
had
an
opportunity
in
january.
it
was
represented
to
both
courts
that
the
legislature
was
going
to
meet
in
january
and
attempt
to
pass
a
congressional
plan
and
attempt
to
pass
a
corrections
bill
for
the
legislative
redistricting
plan.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
before
january
20.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes,
i
would,
justice
souter,
although
i
must
reemphasize
the
unique
time
pressures
that
are
involved
in
redistricting.
and
in
many
cases,
it
may
not
be
possible
for
two
court
systems
to
both
work
on
the
redistricting
process
within
this
narrow
10-month
window.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
redistricting,
which
is
a
function
that
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
referred
to
as
an
important
state
function.
the--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
it
helps
because
what
is
important
for
the
federal
court
to
do
is
to
leave
sufficient
time
for
the
state
to
complete
its
process.
that
includes
the
legislature
if
it
so
chooses
to
act--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
hopefully,
that
would
not
be
the
case
that...
if
the
federal
court
would
permit
a
state
to
go
through
the
process,
both
legislative
and
through
the
state
judiciary,
and
give
them
an
opportunity
to
complete
this
process
in
the
10-month
period
of
time,
that
is
really
what
is
at
stake
in
the
abstention
rule.
germano
involved
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
federal
court
order
that
was
issued
before
a
state
court
order,
and
this
court--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
i
would
suggest
that
that
was
the
rule
that
was
suggested
by
this
court
in
germano,
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
only
reason
for
the
federal
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
is
just
simply
to
provide
some
kind
of
assurance
that
all
concerns
of
voters
will
be
resolved
in
the
process.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
if
a
state
court
is
ongoing,
there
really
is
no
need
for
a
federal
action.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
better
rule.
that
wasn't
the
rule
suggested
in
germano,
but
that--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--germano
is
different
factually,
although
i
would...
i
would
hesitate
to
think
that
a
rule
that
provided
for
some
sort
of
race
to
the
courthouse
would
be
the
proper
rule
to
apply.
our
argument
is
that
this...
that
the
power
of
the
states
to
redistrict
should
be
recognized
both
through
the
legislature
and
through
the
state
court
system
and
make
the
federal
court
a
reviewer
of
last
resort
and
only
if
it's
necessary.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
suggest,
justice
white,
that
it
should
not
review
the
decision
of
the
state
court.
if
there
are
different
parties
raising
different
claims
in
federal
court,
then
the
proper
rule
under
any
abstention
analysis
is
to
look
to
whether
the
state
court
provided
an
adequate
opportunity
for
all
parties
to
have
their
issues
resolved
before
the
state
court.
if
that's
true,
it's
the
end
of
the
case,
and
there's
no
more
need
for
federal
court--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--absolutely
not.
the
rule
should
be,
as
stated
in
germano...
and
i
recognize
the
factual
situation
is
a
little
bit
different
here,
in
fact,
more
favorable
to
the
state
interests...
the
federal
court
should
not
have
an
opportunity
to
review
on
the
merits
what
the
state
court
has
done.
that
appeal
is
through
the--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--pardon?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that
is
true,
in
part
because
of
the
first
of
the
federal
injunctions
which
stopped
the
state
court
from
proceeding
forward.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
certainly
if
there
are
no
issues
raised
in
the
state
court
action
with
respect
to
the
voting
rights
act,
which
is
not
the
case
here,
but
were
that
to
be
the
case,
and
there
is
still
sufficient
time
for
a
federal
court
to
review
those
issues
before
the
election,
the
federal
court
should
go
ahead
and
review
those
because
that's
an
entirely
separate
action.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
instance
the
state
court
should
provide,
as
this
court
did,
an
opportunity
for
anyone
to
come
forward
with
their
concerns,
their
one
person/one
vote
concerns,
in
any
part
of
the
state
and
to
resolve
those
in
the
state
court.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
certainly
we
wouldn't
argue
a
rule
that
forces
a
plaintiff
to
go
to
state
court,
although
from
the
administration
of
justice
standpoint,
that
may
be
the
best
rule
under
the
narrow
window
of
the
redistricting
process.
but
if
a
plaintiff
chooses
to
stay
in
federal
court,
it
may
be
that
their
concerns
don't
get
resolved
until
after
the
first
election
has
run.
that's
a
possible
outcome
because
of
the
quick
time
involved
in
the
process.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
absolutely.
there's
a
lot
that
needs
to
be
done
in
any
redistricting
process,
and
10
months
is
really
an
insufficient
time
for
it.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
state
court
issued
a
final
order
on
legislative
redistricting
after
the
federal
court
issued
its
injunction
in
december.
the
order
was,
of
course,
subject
to
the
limits
of
the
federal
injunction.
both
courts
at
that
point
were
waiting
for
the
legislature
to
come
back
into
session
in
january
to
see
whether
there
was
any
final
legislative
action.
so,
both
courts
were
waiting
for
that.
once
the
legislature
failed
in
january,
then
the
state
court
proceeded
to
issue
a
valid
final
judgment
and
to
proceed
ahead
on
congressional
redistricting.
it's
at
that
point
that
the
federal
court
once
again
stopped
the
state
court
by
enjoining
both
its
actions
on
congressional
and
legislative
redistricting.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
in
february.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
right.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
concerns
to
address
justice
scalia's
concern
about
the
delay
involved
in
the
state
court
consideration
of
congressional
redistricting.
the
state
court
had
before
it
congressional
redistricting
from
the
beginning.
on
august
16
it
set
the
criteria
by
which
it
would
review
any
congressional
plan
that
would
be
enacted
by
the
legislature.
it
was
stayed.
its
hand
was
stayed
by
the
federal
injunction
from
early
december
until
january
10
when
that
injunction
was
lifted
here.
at
that
point,
the
state
court
once
again
moved
forward
on
congressional
redistricting,
asking
the
parties
to
come
forward
and
present
their
views
on
what
the
state
court
should
do
on
congressional
redistricting.
any
delay
in
that
process
is
solely
attributable
to
the
injunctions
that
were
imposed
on
the
state
court
and
on
the
parties
by
the
federal
panel.
there's
no
reason
to
believe...
and
the
state
court,
in
fact--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--thank
you,
your
honor.
