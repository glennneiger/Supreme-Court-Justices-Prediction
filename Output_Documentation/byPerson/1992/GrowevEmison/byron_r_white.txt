well,
the...
that
would
happen
if
the
state
legislature
acted
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
state...
yes,
but
the
state
court
isn't
about
to
insist
on
having
its
own
plan
govern
the
1994
elections
if
the
legislature
has
come
up
with
a
plan
of
its
own
that
meets
constitutional
requirements.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case,
the
state
court
was
working,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
beyond
the
deadline
that
the
federal
court
had--
justice
byron
r.
white
--not
for
the
congressional
districting.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
did
the
federal
court
set
a
deadline
for
the
legislature
to
act
with
respect
to
congressional
districting?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
the
state
court
willing
to
wait
longer
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
prior
to
january
20.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
january
20?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you...
i
gather
you're
suggesting
that...
suppose
the
state
court
in
this
case
had
finished
both
jobs,
both
the
legislative
job
and
the
congressional
redistricting,
and
the...
there
was
also
a
suit
pending
in
the
federal
court.
now,
could
the
federal
court
then
be
asked
to
rule
that
the
state
court
had
misapplied
the
constitution
and
actually
review
the
decision
of
the
state
court?
i
take
it
you
think
it
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
question
of
res
judicata
exactly.
it's
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
has
the
authority
to
say,
well,
the
state
court
should
have
provided
a
minority
district
here
and
it
didn't.
and
the
state
court
had
considered
it
and
rejected
the
notion.
now,
can
the
federal
court
displace
the
state
court
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
state
court
hadn't
finished
the
job
when
the
federal
court
ruled
on
congressional
redistricting.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
court
had
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
finished
the
job
on
the
congressional
redistricting
when
the
federal
court
acted.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
doesn't
tell
you
what
should
happen
if
a
state
court...
after
the
federal
court
holds
its
hand,
if
the
state
court
decides
the
issue...
do
you
think
gingles
tells...
or
do
you
think
scott
against
germano
tells
you
that
this
federal
court
can
then
sit
in
judgment
of
how
the
state
court
decided
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
main
holding
was,
whether
you
call
it
abstention
or
what,
it
was
the
federal
court
should
not
have
proceeded
to
adjudicate
the
case
while
the
state
agencies
were
working.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
consider
whether
the
parties
are
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
issued
an
injunction
to
protect
its
jurisdiction.
is
that--
