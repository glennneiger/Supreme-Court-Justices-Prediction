justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tunheim,
i
guess
at
least
scott
v.
germano
says
that
the
federal
district
court
should
set
a
timetable
for
the
state
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
it
is
the
role
of
the
federal
court
to
do
that
much?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
this
case
i
take
it
the
federal
district
court
did
not
set
a
timetable
for
the
state
to
make
congressional
redistricting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
congressional
redistricting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
for
the
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
have
an
election
coming
up
tomorrow.
what
congressional
plan
will
be
in
effect
tomorrow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
congressional
by
the
federal
district
court
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
say
that
this
court,
if
we
think
the
district
court
erred
with
regard
to
the
congressional
plan,
should
set
aside
that
election?
and
then
what
would
you
do?
i
mean,
what
is
it
you're
asking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
and
say
the
district
court
erred.
what
relief
is
it
that
you're
asking,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
starr,
was
there
a
voting
rights
act
challenge
to
the
congressional
redistricting
brought
in
state
court
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
there
any
section
2
voting
rights
act
challenge
to
the
congressional
plan
brought
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so,
what
is
the
error
there
if
there
was
one?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't...
you
take
no
position
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
willis,
now
here
is
it
true
that
the
state
court
suit
was
filed
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
court
acted
in
a
timely
fashion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
enact
plans.
that
doesn't
refer
to
state
court
action,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
one
thinks
that
enactment
of
a
plan
refers
to
a
legislative
act,
then
it
didn't
cover
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
read
it
that
way,
then
the
state
court
acted
in
a
timely
fashion
perhaps.
at
least
that's
arguable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
the
respondents
claim
that
the
state
plan
that
was
enacted
for
legislative
districts
is
unconstitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
what
we
have
left
is
the
state
court
adopted
plan.
is
that
right?
for
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
all
right.
and
that
could
be
seen
as
the
reflection
of
state
policy
in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
willis,
you
haven't
said
much
about
the
section
2
vote
dilution
claim.
do
you
think
that
such
a
claim
can
be
established
absent
proof
of
minority
block
voting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wait
a
minute.
what
i
asked
you
was
whether
you
believe
that
a
vote
dilution
claim
under
section
2
can
be
established
absent
proof
of
minority
block
voting.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
it
cannot
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
somehow
there
was
such
proof
in
this
case.
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
suppose
we
think
that
the
district
court
improperly
found
a
section
2
voting
rights
act
violation.
now,
had
the
district
court
not
found
that
or
inasmuch
as
we
might
think
it's
improper,
should
the
federal
district
court
then
have
at
least
adopted
the
state
court
plan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
what's
left?
there
was
no
contention
by
respondents
that
the
state
court
plan
was
unconstitutional.
so,
why
in
the
world
wouldn't
the
federal
district
court
resort
to
the
state
court
plan
if
there's
no
section
2
violation?
