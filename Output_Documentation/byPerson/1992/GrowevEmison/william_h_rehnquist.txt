chief
justice
william

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-1420,
joan
growe
v.
james
emison.
mr.
tunheim,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tunheim,
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
o'connor,
you
said
that
the
federal
district
court
should
set
a
timetable
for
the...
does
that
mean
anything
more
than
a
deadline?
i
mean,
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
federal
court
should
tell
the...
that
one
house
should
pass
a
bill
on
such
and
such
a
day
and
another
on
another
day,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
it
isn't
done
by
that
time,
then
the
federal
court
says,
all
right,
we
can't
wait
any
longer.
we're
going
to
go
ahead.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
a
difference
between
this
case...
why
should
the
federal
court
have
retained
jurisdiction
here
since
the
state
court
proceedings
were
initiated
before
any
federal
court
proceedings
were?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
you
should
point
out
in
germano,
the
federal
court
proceedings
came
first.
here
the
state
court
proceedings
came
first.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
and
the
federal
court
cannot
review
the
state
court
decree.
why
not...
if
a
state
court
proceeding
starts
first
in
reapportionment,
why
not
simply
leave
it
to
the
state
courts
and
appeal
through
their
system
and
review
here,
just
as
you
get
through
the
federal
court
system?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
germano
is
different
factually
from
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tunheim.
general
starr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
willis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
explain
scott
v.
germano
if
you're
correct,
mr.
willis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
minnesota
state
court
had
completed
its
redistricting
plan
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
federal
action
said,
well,
this
is
all
wrong.
they
said
there's
no
voting
rights
violation.
we
want
you
to
say
there
is
one.
they
said
it
was
consistent
with
the
u.s.
constitution.
we
want
you
to
say
it
isn't
consistent.
can
the
federal
court
review
the
state
plan
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
reaches
a
result
in
conflict
with
the
state
court--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
the
same
issues.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
rather
strange
result.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
completely
answer
the
question
we're
dealing
with
here.
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
perhaps
a
law
passed
by
the
legislature,
signed
by
the
governor
would
have
been
the
best
evidence
of
state
policy,
but
surely
the...
a
plan
adopted
by
a
state
court
is
better
evidence
of
state
policy
than
a
plan
adopted
by
the
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
state
court
then
was
simply
proceeding
under
the
same
restraints
or
laws
that
the
federal
court
would
have
to
proceed.
it
was
not
entitled
to
make
any
more
policy
choices
than
a
federal
court
would
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
was
delay
in
the
state
proceedings
any
more
objectionable
than
delay
in
the
federal
proceedings?
i
mean,
first
you
have
the
district
court
and
then
you
have
an
appeal
here.
so,
it's
not
as
if
the
district
court
spoke
with
any
final
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
this
district
court
decree
was
entered
when?
last
february?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
last
spring.
here
it
is
november.
we're
hearing
the
case
argued
on
the
merits.
maybe
there
will
be
an
opinion
out,
you
know,
this
winter
or
this
spring.
and
obviously,
it
wasn't...
this
review
wasn't
in
time
for
the
1992
election.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you
don't
defend
the
district
court's
decision
to
enter
the
stay
here,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
whose
view
do
you
choose?
this
court's
or
the
district
court's?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willis.
mr.
tunheim,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
tunheim.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
more
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
