what
if...
how
would
your
rule
apply
to
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
in
the
federal
action
raises
issues
that
were
not
raised
in
the
state
litigation?
for
example,
a
state
litigation
might
just
challenge
the
redistricting
under
state
constitutional
provisions
and
never
raise
a
question
under
the
voting
rights
act
or
the
constitution.
justice

stevens
or
if
they're
challenging
a
different
part
of
the
state.
let's
say,
they
didn't
like
the
district
in
minneapolis,
but
in
the
federal
action,
they
might
have
challenged
something
else.
should
the
federal
court
abstain
or
should
it
go
ahead?
justice
john
paul
stevens
must
the
plaintiff
challenge
in
the
state
court
if
the
plaintiff
prefers
a
federal
forum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
a
lot
of
the
time
is
not
always
attributable
to
the
federal
proceeding.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
starr,
i
know
the
government
doesn't
take
a
position
on
the
threshold
issues
here,
but
does
the
section
2
analysis
in
a
federal
proceeding
depend
at
all
on
what
may
have
happened
with
regard
to
section
2
issues
in
a
state
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
beyond
looking
at
the
record,
supposing
a
state
court
disagreed
with
your
analysis
and
found
a
section
2
violation
that
you
would
say
was
plainly
wrong,
would
there
be...
would
that
judgment
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
in
a
parallel
federal
proceeding,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
very
important
because
we
have
ongoing
litigation
in
two
systems
frequently,
and
i
think
the
united
states...
it's
strange
to
me
you
don't
have
a
position
on
that
issue.
