justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
position
is
that
that
deadline
applies
not
just
to
the
state
legislature,
but
also
to
the
state
courts,
that
you
set
a
date
and
if
the
state
hasn't
taken
action
by
then
either
through
its
legislature
or
through
its
courts,
then
the
federal
courts
get
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tunheim,
could
you
tell
me...
you
made
the
comment,
of
course,
the
state
court
didn't
finish
because
it
was
enjoined.
was
the
state
court
not
proceeding
at
all
during
december?
it
was
not
doing
anything
at
all
when
the
injunction
was
in
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
february.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
chief
justice's
question
to
you
didn't
involve
a
future
or
pending
state
action.
it
involved
a
completed
state
action.
and
you've
said
that
the
federal
court
could
simply
review
and
overturn
the
result
of
the
state
court
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
area
where
this
is
so,
where
a
federal
issue
was
presented
to
a
state
court,
the
state
court
decides
it
and
rules
upon
it,
and
a
federal
court
has
authority
to
review
that
same
issue
and
come
to
a
different
conclusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
lots
of
areas
where
claims
can
be
brought
in
either
federal
or
state
courts.
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
other
federal
causes
of
action.
do
you
know
of
any
other
area
where...
when
the
federal
cause
of
action
has
been
resolved
in
the
state
court,
the
federal
court
has
authority
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
set
aside
the
state
court
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
that
that--
--it
wasn't
rejected.
it
was
simply
not
enacted
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
one
can
view
the
legislative...
the
legislature
did
not
adopt
a
different
plan.
so,
all
that
happened
when
the
legislative
process
was
all
done
was
that
the
plan
announced
by
the
state
court
remained
in
effect.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that
was
the
state
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
willis,
can
i
explore
with
you
a
little
further
the
consequence
of
the
state
court
decree
if
the
state
court
proceeding
had
been
allowed
to
go
forward?
let's
take
it
out
of
the
voting
rights
context.
suppose
you
have
a
shareholder
dispute
in
a
close
corporation,
and
there's
some
dispute
as
to
how
the
stock
should
be
divided.
and
one
of
the
three
shareholders
sues
in
state
courts,
and
the
state
court
says,
well,
it
ought
to
be
60-20-20.
that's
how
the
stock
ought
to
be
divided,
and
a
judgment
is
entered
to
that
effect.
meanwhile,
another
suit
is
begun
in
federal
court
somehow,
some
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
wouldn't
the
suit
in
the
federal
court
which
claims
likewise
an
inequitable
distribution...
wouldn't
that
suit
have
to
start
on
the
assumption
that
the
current
distribution
is
60-20-20,
the
decree
entered
by
the
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
even
if
you
didn't
have
an
identity
of
parties.
if
the
court
had
the
power
to
order,
you
know,
statewide
that
there
be...
in
the
context
of
my
example,
that
the
corporate
shares
be
divided
that
way,
they
would
be
divided
that
way.
now,
you
could
argue
that
that
new
arrangement
is
violative
of
federal
law,
but
wouldn't
that
new
arrangement
be
the
status
quo?
and
why
isn't
that
the
same
here?
if
that
is
true
in
that
situation,
why
isn't
it
here?
you
can
review
the
state
court
determination
so
long
as
there
are
new
parties,
but
the
status
quo,
what
you
must
attack,
is
the
current
court
decree,
not
the
prior
legislative
districting
that
this
legislature
had
established.
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
it
goes
back
to
that.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
willis,
did
the
state
court
during...
in
december,
when
the
december
stay
was
in
effect,
did
they
do
any
work
at
all
on,
you
know,
how
they
would
themselves
redistrict
if
the
state
legislature
didn't
come
up
with
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
somewhat
relevant
to
whether
the
state
court
was
dilatory
later
when
the
stay
was
finally
lifted;
that
is,
when
the
legislature
had
acted,
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
well,
we
moved
as
fast
as
we
could
once
the
december
stay
was,
in
effect,
eliminated
by
the
legislative
plan
having
been
adopted.
if
i
thought
that
they
could
have
gone
ahead
and
done
something
during
december,
i
might
feel
differently
about
it.
do
you
think
that
they
were
able
to
proceed
with
contingency
plans
during
december
even
though
they
couldn't
have
violated
the
federal
district
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
no.
91-1420,
is
growe
versus
emison.
it
is
an
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
minnesota.
the
petitioner
john
growe
is
the
secretary
of
state
of
minnesota.
the
case
is
difficult
to
describe
because
at
issue
are
really
two
cases.
a
group
of
minnesota
voters
filed
an
action
in
state
court
against
the
minnesota's
secretary
of
state
and
other
election
officials.
alleging
that
in
light
of
the
1990
census,
minnesota's
federal
congressional
and
state
legislative
districts
were
malapportioned
in
violation
of
the
federal
and
state
constitutions,
and
seeking,
in
that
suit,
declaratory
relief
and
judicial
creation
of
new
districts,
if
the
state
legislature
failed
to
act.
shortly
and
after
that
suit
was
filed
and
that
suit
is
not
is
the
suit
before
us
here.
the
appealees
in
the
present
case
in
another
group
of
minnesota
voters
filed
an
action
against
essentially
the
same
defendants
including
the
secretary
of
state
seeking
the
same
relief
in
federal
district
court.
the
federal
suit
raised
the
same
constitutional
claims
and
in
addition
raised
a
claim
that
the
legislative
district
in
minneapolis
diluted
minority
voting
rights
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
while
these
two
cases
were
pending,
the
minnesota
state
legislature
adopted
a
plan
for
new
legislative
districts,
new
state
districts,
but
that
plan
contained
numerous
drafting
errors.
the
district
court,
the
federal
court
set
a
deadline
for
the
state
legislature
to
redistrict
both
legislative
and
congressional
districts
and
refused
to
abstain
or
to
defer
to
the
state
court
action
which
was
pending.
the
state
court
meanwhile,
issued
a
preliminary
legislative
plan
correcting
the
technical
errors
in
the
state's
legislative
plan.
it
intended
to
hold
that
plan
and
advance
pending
action
by
the
legislature
to
correct
its
own
mistakes.
the
district
court,
the
federal
court,
then
stayed
further
proceedings
in
the
state
court
action
forbad
the
state
court
from
proceeding
any
further.
this
court,
one
month
later,
vacated
that
federal
stay.
when
legislature
failed
to
act,
the
state
court
issued
a
final
order
adapting
its
own
legislative
plan
and
held
hearings
on
competing
proposals
for
a
congressional
districting
plans.
the
district
court,
the
federal
court
intern
adapted
its
own
legislative
and
congressional
redistricting
plan
and
permanently
enjoined
interference
with
implementation
of
its
plans.
the
court
concluded
in
effect
that
the
state
court's
legislative
plan
violated
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
because
it
did
not
contain
a
super
majority
minority
senate
district
in
minneapolis,
that
is
a
district
in
which
minority
voters
were
a
clear
majority.
the
district
court's
plan
did
contain
such
a
district
with
a
majority
composed
of
at
least
three
distinct
minority
groups.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
in
accord
with
our
opinion
in
a
case
called
scott
versus
germano,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
erred
in
not
deferring
to
the
state
court
proceeding.
states
have
the
primary
duty
and
responsibility
to
draw
there
election
districts.
federal
courts
must
defer
action
when
a
state
through
its
legislative
or
judicial
branch
has
begun
in
timely
fashion
to
perform
that
task.
moreover,
in
finding
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
the
district
court
erred
in
not
applying
the
pre-requisites
identified
in
a
case
called
thornburg
versus
gingles,
for
vote
dilution
challenges
to
multimember
districts.
we
hold
today
that
the
three
gingles
pre
conditions
namely
a
minority
group
that
is
sufficiently
large
and
geographically
compact
to
constitute
a
majority
in
the
single-member
district;
minority
political
cohesion;
and
thirdly
majority
block
voting
that
enables
defeated
minority
preferred
candidate.
those
two
factors
also
apply
to
a
vote
delusion
challenge
to
a
single-member
district.
in
the
present
case
there
is
no
evidence
of
majority
block
voting
or
of
political
cohesion
among
the
three
minority
groups
the
district
court
combined
in
the
new
district.
the
gingles
preconditions
were
normally
ignored,
but
on
the
present
records
were
unattainable.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
