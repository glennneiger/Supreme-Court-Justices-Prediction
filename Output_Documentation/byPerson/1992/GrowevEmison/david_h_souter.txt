justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
the
time
set,
let's
say,
for
state
court
action
should
be
a
time
which
would
leave
the
federal
courts
with
time
themselves
to
come
up
with
a
plan
if
the
state
courts
don't.
you
agree
to
that,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
get
at.
if
that
is
the
case,
so
that
any
date
that
would
give
the
federal
courts
time
to
begin,
would
not
be
a
date
which
would
give
the
state
courts
time
to
finish.
in
a
case
like
that,
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
say
that
abstention
really
doesn't
have
much
of
an
application
because
if,
indeed,
that's
the
case,
then
by
abstaining,
the
only
thing
the
federal
court
is
doing
is
just
squeezing
its
own
timeframe
in?
and
we
know
perfectly
well
that
it's
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
considering
its
own
plan
before
the
state
courts
could
have
acted.
so,
in
a
case
like
that,
why
have
any
abstention?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know
it,
but
i
mean,
how
does
that
help
you
to
get
to
an
answer
of
my...
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
on
the
hypothesis
that
you
and
i
are
working
on,
the
only
effect
of
leaving
that
time
is
kind
of
a
gesture
of
politeness
because
we're
assuming
that
the
state
courts
aren't
going
to
have
time
to
finish
by
the
date
at
which
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
to
begin
if
there
is
no
plan
in
place,
so
that
the
only
thing
we're
really
doing
is
going
through
kind
of
a...
sort
of
an
after
you,
alphonse
scheme
when
you
know
perfectly
well
that
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
get
into
it
before
the
states
are
going
to
finish
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
germano
should
be
overruled?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
tells
them
to
abstain
for
a
while.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
argument,
i'm
not
sure
why
deferrals
should
be
any
more
palatable
than
abstention.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
we
consider
the
potential
appellate
process
at
all?
you've
got
a
valid
judgment
once
the
state
court
acts,
just
as
you've
got
a
valid
judgment
once
a
three-judge
federal
court
acts.
why
isn't
that
enough?
why
isn't
that
the
only
thing
that
should
be
considered?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
conduct
an
election
based
on
a...
in
this
case,
your
three-judge
state
court
decree.
there's
no
difficulty
in
conducting
an
election.
you
just
wouldn't
have
time
to
appeal
it
through
the
two
tiers.
in
other
words,
the
state
is
providing
a
perfectly
enforceable
remedy,
and
you're,
of
course,
quite
right
that
there
isn't
time
to
appeal
the
correctness
of
that
remedy
perhaps
in
cases,
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
see
why
that
is
a...
as
it
were,
a
failing
of
the
state
court
system
which
somehow
should
be
considered
in
determining
what
the
federal
courts
should
or
should
not
do.
