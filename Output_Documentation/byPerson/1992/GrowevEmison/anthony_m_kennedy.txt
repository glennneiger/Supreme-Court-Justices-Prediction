do
you
take
no
position
at
all
on
the
abstention
argument
that
we've
just
heard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
court
said
there
was
no
statistical
evidence
of
political
cohesiveness
in
the
minority.
was
there
any
other
evidence
at
all
either
in
the
state
proceeding
that
it
could
take
notice
of
or
in
the
proceedings
before
it
from
which
it
might
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
politically
cohesive
force
in
the
minority
voting
block?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
did
the
district
court
handle
that?
as
i
read
the
footnote,
footnote
30,
it
seems
simply
to
make
a
presumption
that
this...
that
there's
usually
going
to
be
political
cohesiveness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
parties
were
enjoined
from
proceeding
before
the
state
court,
and
then
you
suggest
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
state
court
to
continue
absent
the
representation
of
the
parties?
that's
very
curious.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
said
there's
no
statistical
evidence.
