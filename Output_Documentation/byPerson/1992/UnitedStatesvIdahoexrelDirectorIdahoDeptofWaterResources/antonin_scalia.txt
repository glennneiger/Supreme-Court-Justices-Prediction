but
i
think...
i
think
you
could
say
that
in
granting
the
waiver,
it
was
assumed
that
the
procedures,
if
not
for
the
sake
of
the
united
states
at
least
for
the...
for
the
sake
of
other
people,
would
comply
with
due
process
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
do
you
have
some
other
example
that
would
prove
your
point,
because
i
don't
find
that
one
a
persuasive
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
since...
since
i
am
sure
that
the...
that
the
mccarran
provision
assumed
that
any
procedures
would
comply
with...
with
the
requirements
of
due
process,
i
don't
think
that
this
example
that
you
give
proves
that...
that
the
mccarran
act
was
not
meant
to
subject
the
government
to
procedures.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
sovereign
immunity.
on
the
base...
i
mean,
the...
on
the
quite
different
basis
of
selective...
you
know,
being
discriminated
against.
