justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
minear,
the
last
sentence,
the
proviso,
says
no
judgment
for
costs
shall
be
entered
against
the
united
in
such
a
suit.
now,
is
it
possible
that
these
fees
could
be
considered
costs?
they're
paid
in
advance,
but
are
they
the
type
of
fee
that
could
be
considered
a
cost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
found
troublesome
the
government's
argument
that
the
united
states
isn't
bound
by
any
procedural
requirements
of
the
state
in
which
the
water
litigation
is
conducted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
strikes
me
as
pretty
broad.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean
there
may
be
time
limits
for
filing
certain
things
and
a
whole
array
of
state
procedural
requirements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
the
united
states
isn't
bound
by
any
of
those,
i
don't
see
how
the
litigation
could
proceed.
