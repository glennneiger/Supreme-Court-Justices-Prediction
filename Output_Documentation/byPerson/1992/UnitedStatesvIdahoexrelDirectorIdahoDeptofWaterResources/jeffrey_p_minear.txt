mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
mccarran
amendment
allows
the
state
of
idaho
to
charge
the
united
states
with
filing
fees
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
state
water
rights
adjudication.
this
case
has
its
origins
in
a
dispute
between
the
state
of
idaho
and
the
idaho
power
company
over
the
company's
right
to
use
snake
river
flows
for
power
development.
idaho
ultimately
decided
to
conduct
a
general
adjudication
of
all
water
rights
in
the
snake
river
basin.
and
it
joined
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
mccarran
amendment,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
congress
enacted
the
mccarran
amendment
to
allow
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
such
adjudications,
but
it
specifically
provided
that
the
united
states
is
exempt
from
judgments
for
costs,
which
was
the
mechanism
that
idaho
and
other
states
commonly
used
to
pay...
to
pay
for
those
adjudications
at
that
time.
nevertheless,
idaho
has
now
asserted
that
it
can
charge
the
united
states
filing
fees
to
the
same
end,
to
pay
for
the
adjudication.
we
originally
estimated
that
those
fees
would
amount
to
at
least
$10
million
in
this
litigation
alone.
we
have
now
completed
filing
our
various
water
rights
claims
with
the
department
of
water
resources
and
it
appears
that
those
fees
will
total
at
least
$30
million.
we
challenged
idaho's
fee
assessments
through
a
writ
of
mandamus,
and
the
idaho
supreme
court
ultimately
held
by
a
vote
of
3
to
2
that
the
mccarran
amendment
requires
the
united
states
to
pay
those
fees.
we
seek
reversal
of
that
judgment.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
the
united
states
is
immune
from
cost
and
fee
assessments
unless
congress
expressly
provides
otherwise.
the
mccarran
amendment
contains
no
such
waiver.
an
inspection
of
the
mccarran
amendment's
text
proves
our
point.
the
first
sentence,
the
so-called
joinder
provision,
allows
idaho
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
in
the
snake
river
basin
adjudication,
but
it
says
nothing
about
requiring
the
united
states
to
pay
money.
the
mere
consent
to
joinder
is
not
consent
to
pay
for
the
adjudication
or
to
pay
for
the
expenses
of
other
parties.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
they
certainly
serve
the
very
same
function
as
a
judgment
for
cost.
in
fact,
the
idaho
code
makes
that
quite
clear.
it
states,
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
in
order
to
provide
an
adequate
and
equitable
cost-sharing
formula
for
financing
the
costs
of
adjudicating
water
rights
the
department
of
water
resources
shall...
shall
accept
no
claim...
notice
of
claim,
et
cetera.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is...
that
is
not
our
position.
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
mccarran
amendment
does
not
specifically
address
state
procedures.
now,
i
think
that
it's
implicit
in
the
join...
the
notion
of
joinder
that
the
united
states
will
comply
with
reasonable
procedures
of
the
state.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
and
idaho--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
our
position
is
that...
we
think
that
the
mccarran
amendment
does
not
expressly
address
this
issue,
but
we
think
that
the
united
states
is
bound
by
reasonable
procedures.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
united
states
reserves
its
right
to
object
to
any
procedures
that
are
aberrant
or
that
are
hostile
to
federal
interests.
for...
assume,
for
example,
that
idaho
decided
to
determine
water
rights
by
a
coin
flip.
the
united
states
does
not
necessarily
have
due
process
rights
to
make
an
objection.
its
protection
is
in...
is
based
on
supremacy
grounds,
and
in
its
protection
under
sovereign
immunity
principles.
and
we
believe
the
united
states
could
have
kept--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
that's...
and
that
is
my
point.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
excuse
me,
i'm
not
sure...
other
examples
of
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and,
again,
i
think
that
there's
nothing
that
the...
in
the
mccarran
amendment
that
addresses
state
procedures
specifically.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and,
again,
we're
talking
about
the
implications
and
not...
my
point
is
simply
that
the
united
states
still
has
the
right
to
raise
objections
to
procedures
that
are
either
unfair,
which,
i
think,
is
the
point
that
you're
making
in
terms
of
them
being...
not
comporting
with
due
process,
or
also
procedures
that
are
directly
hostile
to
federal
interests.
for
instance,
if...
suppose
that
in
terms
of
filing
deadlines,
the
united
states
was
subject
to
a
shorter
period
than
other
parties.
we
think
that
the
united
states
may
well
have
the
right
to
object
to
those
types
of
procedures.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that...
that
is
correct.
again,
the
point
here,
however,
is
the...
the
question
of
assessment
of
fees.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
question
with
respect
to
the
united
states
is
whether
congress
has
waived
its
historic
immunity
from
those
types
of
assessments.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
we...
and
our
answer
is
it
has
not.
and
we
would
look
to
the
three
provisions
of
the...
the
three
relevant
provisions
of
the
mccarran
act.
first
is
the
joinder
provision
and,
as
i
say,
all
that
consents
to
is
the
joinder
of
the
united
states
in
the
proceeding.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
costs
or
fees
for
which
a
separate
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
would
be
required.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
with
respect
to...
to
fees
and
costs.
this
court
has
recognized
those
types
of...
any
cost-shifting
mechanism
requires
a
separate
waiver
from
congress.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
for
the
very
reason
that
it...
that
the
provision
was
attached
to
the
third
provision,
the
so-called
judgment
provision,
which
subjects
the
united
states
to
the
judgments
of
the
state
court.
and
we
believe
that
congress
put
in
the
proviso
to
make
clear
that
that
provision
did
not
subject
the
united
states
to
judgments
for
costs.
it's
important
to
remember--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
have
to.
in
the
judicial
proceeding
it
would
have
to
make
a
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
believe
it
does
not
subsume
compliance
with
filing
fees.
again,
this...
congress
has...
we
require
a
waiver
from
congress.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
it
had
been
a
$5
fee,
in
all
likelihood
we
would
not
have
challenged
it
because
it's
a
de
minimis
amount.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
because
it...
the
law
does
not
concern
itself
with
trifles,
as
the
court
said
in
weltover
last
year,
that
de
minimis
not
curat
lex.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
simply
would
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
in
terms
of
types
of
claims--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
terms--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
it
does
not
discriminate
directly
against
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
claims
made
by
the
united
states.
however,
the
types
of
claims
the
united
states
typically
makes,
for
instance
instream
flows,
are--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--require
fees
at
a
much
higher
level.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and,
also,
certain
types
of
claims
are,
in
fact...
or
require
a
higher
fee
even
though
there's
no
added
expense
in
adjudicating
those
types
of
claims.
but,
again,
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
the
instream
flow
claims
for
example.
but,
again,
the
question
here
is
not
ultimately
one
of
reasonableness
or
fairness
of
the
state
procedures.
it's
a
question
of
whether
congress
has
consented
to
these--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
with
respect
to
the
federal
government,
the
state
does
not
carry
any
burden,
in
fact,
of
even
investigating
those
claims.
they
simply
take
the
claim
of
the
united
states,
abstract
it
and
include
it
in
the
report.
so
there's
very
little
cost
involved
to
the
state
actually
examining
those
claims,
as
compared
to
going
out
and
investigating
individual
small
claims.
but,
again,
we're
getting,
i
think,
removed
from
the
point
that
i...
i
think
is
critical
here,
and
that
is
that
congress
must
specifically
consent
to
the
payment
of
fees.
and
we
think
that
the
cost
proviso
indicates
quite
clearly
that
congress
was
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we're
taking
the
position
that
they
are
not,
by
their
terms,
a
judgment
for
costs.
there
is...
can
be
distinction
between
a
judgment
for
costs--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--ultimately,
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
ultimately
is
correct.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
when
the
mccarran
amendment
was
enacted
in
1952
it
was
against
the
backdrop
of
other
well-accepted
principles,
including
the
fact
that
the
united
states
was
not
liable
for
fees.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
i
think
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--you
don't
need
to
resolve
the
procedural
question--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
we
think...
again,
this
is
the...
this
issue
arises...
our
basic...
let
me
begin
with
this
point.
our
basic
position
is
there
must
be
a
separate
and
specific
waiver
before
fees
or
costs
can
be
assessed
against
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now,
the
question
of
procedures
was
brought
into
this
case
by
the
interpretation
of
idaho
of
the
pleading
provision.
there
is
a...
a
second
provision
says
the
united
states,
when
any...
when
a
party
to
any
such
suit,
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable.
we
believe
that
the
state
laws
was
referring
to,
in
fact,
the
laws
governing
the
appropriation
of
water
rights
by...
under
state
law,
the
acquisition
of
water
rights
themselves,
not
the
laws...
not
procedural
laws.
idaho's
argument
is
that
reference
actually
is
referring
to
procedural
laws.
our
basic
point
is
that
procedure
has
nothing
to
do
about...
with
this.
even
if
you
accepted
that
provision
as...
as
referring
to
procedural
laws,
the
united
states
still
would
not
be
subject
to
fees
because
there
is
not
an
express
waiver
of
the
united
states'
immunity
from
fees.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
our
argument
with
respect
to
fees
is
much
stronger.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
if
i've
not
been
clear
on
this.
that
our
point
is
that
the
question
here
is
the
united
states'
immunity
with
respect
to
fees.
as
to
procedures,
we
believe
that
we
do
have...
do
reserve
the
right
to
challenge
them
on
the
basis
that
they
are
either
unreasonable
or
hostile
to
federal
interests,
but
that's
not
a
sovereign
immunity
question.
again,
that's
simply
the
rights
that
we
think
are
implicit
within
the
mccarran
amendment,
and
i
think
rights
that
were
recognized
in
footnote
20
of
san
carlos
where
you
noticed
that
state
procedures
might
be
inadequate
to
adjudicate
certain
types
of
federal
water
rights.
the...
the
crucial
question
here,
though,
is
whether
there
has
been
an
express
waiver
of
fees.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
1952
when
this
act
was
enacted,
congress
was
quite
clear
that
there
did
need
to
be
a
separate
waiver
for...
for
fees.
in
fact,
2412(a)
at
that
time,
28
u.s.c.
2412
(a)
made
that
point,
that
congress
is
not
liable
for
fees
or
costs
unless
there
is
an
express
waiver.
and
i
don't
think
that
ultimately
idaho
or
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
quarreled
with
the
need
for
a
waiver.
the
question
has
been,
instead,
whether
the
mccarran
amendment
is
explicit
or
clear
enough
on
that
point.
and
we
believe
that
the
mccarran
amendment
is
not.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
fees,
and
the
only
point
where
it
discusses
monetary
liabilities
is
with
respect
to
a
judgment
for
costs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
does
not
say
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
cases
like
cappaert,
federal-reserved
water
rights
are
governed
by
federal
law,
not
state
law.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
what
the
mccarran
amendment
provides
is
the...
an
opportunity
to
join
the
united
states
in
the
adjudication
so
that
all
water
rights
in
the
basin
can
be
determined.
that
was
the
focus
and
the
principle
point
of
the
mccarran
amendment,
but
it
did
not
say
anything
about
who
pays
for
those
procedures
except
with
respect
to
the
cost
proviso.
now,
at
the
time
the
mccarran
amendment
was
enacted,
the
most
common
way
for
paying
for
these
types
of
procedures
was
through
a
judgment
of
costs
at
the
end
of
the
litigation,
and
the
mccarran
amendment
made
quite
clear
that
the
united
states
was
not
subject
to
those
judgments.
now,
we
think
that
the
clear
implication
of
that
is
the
united
states
is
not
responsible
for
paying
for
the
adjudication
or
for
paying
the
fees
and
expenses
of
its
adversaries
in
the
adjudication.
we
don't
believe
the
cost
proviso
was
only
limited
to
the...
to
the
notion
that...
that
you
can't
assess
the
united
states
with
the
actual
costs
at
the
end
of
the
litigation,
but
you
can
assess
filing
fees
that
may
bear
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
costs
of
the
adjudication,
and
impose
those
against
the
united
states.
we
don't
believe
that
that
was
congress'
concern.
congress,
instead,
was
indicating
that
it...
the
united
states
could
be
joined
in
these
proceedings,
but
the
states
would
have
to
finance
the
proceedings.
now,
i
would
like
to...
to
turn
to
the
pleading
provision,
because
it
appears
that
is
the
provision
that
has
costs--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
quite
correct.
that...
i
believe
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
we
think
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right.
but
by
the
same
token,
when
the
united
states
is
brought
in
as
an
involuntary
defendant
in
state
court,
the
united
states
should
not
have
to
pay
fees
in
those
circumstances.
the
general
practice
is
that
the
united...
that
courts
normally--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
draw
no
distinction
in
principle,
but
in
practical
effect.
the
fact
is
that
if
these
were
$5
fees
or
$1
fees,
the
united
states,
in
all
likelihood
would
protest
those
fees,
but
would
nevertheless
pay
them
because
we
simply
would
not
want
to
burden
the
courts
with
these
disputes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
idaho's
position
does
not
correspond
exactly
to
what
the
statute
itself
says,
but
i
take
idaho's
position
to
be
that
the
fees
that
are
generated
here
would
cover
the
cost
of
investigating
water
rights,
preparing
the
director's
report,
which
is
then
submitted
to
the
court
as
a
pleading
before
the
court.
and
in
that
report
it
would
have
an
investigation
of
state
water
claims
and
abstract
of
federal
claims.
what...
they
will
simply
take
our
federal
claims
and
abstract
them...
provide
a
summary
and
include
that
in
the
report.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
perhaps
the
united
states
would
have.
well,
the
united
states
has
to
pay
all
of
its
fees
of
investigating
its
own
claims
in
any
event.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
idaho
does
not
investigate
our
claims.
we
investigate
our
claims.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
prepare
the
lengthy
claims
and
all
they
do
is
provide
an
abstract,
a
secretarial
service
in
a
sense.
in
addition,
idaho
also
uses
those
fees
to
raise
objections
to
water
rights
claims,
and
they
would
also
use
those
fees
for
service
of
process,
for
paying
attorneys.
i
believe
that
they
have
budge
ted
$2.1
million
in
attorneys'
fees
that
will
be
paid
out
of
these
fees.
now,
that
might
not
necessarily
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
these
are
salaries
of
the...
of
the
attorneys
in
the
department
of
water
resources.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
that
includes
the
salaries
for
conducting
depositions,
conducting
investigation,
writing
legal
memoranda
and
the
like.
in
sum,
these
costs
are
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
this
applies
to
everyone's
claims.
they're
not
distinguishing...
the
money
all
goes
into
a
single
fund,
and
they
then
use
that
also
to
pay
for
the
court,
for
the
court
procedures,
to
pay
for
the
department
of
water
resources
work,
it's
general
work
in
participating
as
a
party
in
the
water
rights
adjudication.
now,
i
believe
that
idaho
claims
that
the...
they
fund
separately
the
attorneys
who
actually
appear
in
court
such
as
in
this
proceeding,
but
by
and
large
they
are
also
funding
water
rights
attorneys
in
the
department
of
water
resources.
now,
we
believe
that
ultimately
the...
idaho's
position
here
just
does
not
conform
to
the
principles
that
this
court
has
spoken
to
with
respect
to
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
believe
it
must
be
a
clear
and
unambiguous
waiver
before
the
united
states
can
be
assessed
with
these
types
of
fees.
and
this
makes...
indeed,
makes
good
sense,
because
if
the
state
can
count
on
the
federal
treasury
to
pay
for
these
types
of
adjudications,
it
will
have
no
incentive
to
conduct
an
efficient
adjudication.
and
it's
not
clear,
as
i
said,
that
these
fees
in
fact
have
any
bearing
or
relationship
on
the
actual
costs
that
will
be
incurred
by
the
department
of
water
resources
in
participating
in
this
lawsuit.
i
believe
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think,
as
a
general
matter,
that
the
expression
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
we
believe
it
would
be
impermissible.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
impermissible
to
look
to
legislative
history.
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that
the
provision
as
a
whole
recognizes
several
points.
first
of
all,
when
the
united
states...
it
begins,
when
a
party
to
such
suit,
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable.
we
believe
the
state
laws
they
are
referring
to
are
the
state
laws
that
are
referred
to
in
the
prior
sentence,
the
state
laws
by
which
water
is
appropriated
under
state
law.
the
point
of
this
sentence
is
that
the
united
states
cannot
raise
a
sovereignty
objection
to
the
procedures
that
a
state
has
for
perfecting
a
state
water
right.
we
have
to
raise...
if
we
have
an
objection
to
those
procedures,
we
have
to
raise
them
at
that
time
when
the
procedure...
when
we
first
apply
for
a
water
right.
we
cannot
come
in
later
on
in
a
general
water
rights
adjudication
and
then
raise
that
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
for
the
applying
for
a
permit
for
the
water
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now
that
explains
why
this
only
applies
"when
a
party"...
the
language,
"when
a
party
to
any
such
suit.
"
it
recognizes
that
if
we're
not
a
party
to
that
suit,
if
we're
just
applying
for
a
water
right
and
idaho
imposes
some
burden
that
we
believe
is
impermissible,
we
can
raise
that
challenge
at
that
time.
it
is,
in
a
sense,
more
like
an
exhaustion
requirement
than
anything
else.
it
requires
that
we
raise
our
objections
to
a
state
permitting
requirement
at
the
time
we
apply
for
the
permit.
that
also
explains
why
it
uses
the
language
"any
right
to
plead".
if
idaho
was
correct
that
the
point
of
this
whole
provision
was
to
subject
us
to
state
procedures,
you
would
think
that
congress
would
simply
have
said
the
united
states
shall
be
subject
to
state
procedures.
now,
i
think
the
important
point
in
this
case
is
it's
about
fees
and
it's
about
costs.
and
in
1952,
the
costs...
the
general
costs
provision
of
the
u.s.
code
said
this:
"the
united
states
shall
be
liable
for
fees
and
costs
only
when
such
liability
is
expressly
provided
for
by
act
of
congress.
"
the
revisor's
note
notes
that
this
follows
the
well
known
common
law
rule
that
a
sovereign
is
not
liable
for
costs
unless
specific
provision
for
such
liability
is
made
by
law.
this
is
a
corollary
to
the
rule
that
a
sovereign
cannot
be
sued
without
his
consent,
and
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
that
general
statute
would
have
exempted
the
united
states
from
both
fees
and
costs.
however,
when
congress
wrote
the
mccarran
amendment,
it
also
provided
the
second
clause...
the
second
clause
of
the
pleading
provision:
the
united
states,
when
a
party
to
any
such
suit,
shall
be
subject
to
the
judgments,
orders,
and
decrees
of
the
court
having
jurisdiction,
provided
that
no
judgment
for
costs
shall
be
entered
against
the
united
states.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
cost
proviso
was
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
the
mere
fact
that
we
are
subject
to
judgments
for
costs...
for
judgments
generally,
did
not
mean
we
were
subject
to
judgments
for
costs.
and
that
explains
why
it...
read
in
the
context
of
section
2412(a),
the
cost
proviso
was
inserted
there,
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
united
states
was
not
expected
to
pick
up
these
expenses.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
omitted
in
the
section
2412(a).
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
reason
why...
there's
simply
no
mention
of
them
one
way
or
another,
and
that
means
the
common
law
rule
would
still
be
in
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and,
in
fact,
it's...
i
suppose
by
negative
implication
what's...
what
is
indicated
is
that
although
a
prevailing
party
can
now
collect
costs
under
the
present
version
of
2412(a),
he
cannot
collect
fees.
and
that's
reflected
in
the
various
statutes
of
the
federal
code.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
why,
i
think
so.
but
nevertheless,
the
united
states
still
does
not
pay
fees
even
to
a
court.
that's
made
clear
in
the
notes
of
28
u.s.c.
1914,
for
instance,
where
it
recognizes
that
although
fees
may
be
assessed
against
parties,
the
united
states
does
not
pay
fees
in
the
courts.
now,
that's
the
common
law
rule
that's
been
followed
here,
and
i
think
that
idaho
has
really
seized
upon
the
absence
of
the
word
filing
fees
to
turn
what
used
to
be
judgments
for
costs
into
filing
fees.
they
mention,
for
instance,
the
court-appointed
experts,
the
fact
that
we're
simply
paying
for
a
court-appointed
expert.
a
court-appointed
expert
is
an
assessable
cost
under
section
1920
of
the
judicial
code.
that
is
one
of
the
costs
that
a
person
could,
in
fact,
get
compensation
for.
so
i
think
it's
clear
that
what
they've
really
done
is
taken
a
procedure
whereby
the
state
was
precluded
from
charging
the
united
states
with
the
expense
of
the
litigation
by
the
cost
proviso,
and
tried
to
get
around
that
by
collecting
the
fees
up
front
through
filing...
a
filing
fee
system,
which
may
bear
very
little
relationship
to
the
actual
costs
incurred.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
there
was
no
practice
in
idaho
of
charging
filing
fees
in
a
court
adjudication.
there
were
three
states
that
charged
filing
fees
in
a
administrative
adjudication,
but
those
are
not
subject
to
the
mccarran
amendment
in
any
event.
the
mccarran
amendment
only
provides
suits...
applies
in
suits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
there
were
three
states,
we
believe,
that
did
charge
a
filing
fee.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
california
charged
$5
per
claimant,
and
i
believe
that
washington
and
colorado
also
had
a
minor
charge
along
those
lines.
but
both
of
those
states
ultimately
provided
for
the
final
payment
of
the
adjudication
through
a
judgment
for
costs.
that
was
the...
the
most
common
way
in
which
these
suits
were
adjudicated
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--certainly
not
comparable
to
these
fees.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
only
comparable
fee
would
have
been
the
oregon...
oregon
did
have
a
variable
fee,
but
it
only
applied
in
administrative
proceedings.
and
as
i
said,
the
mccarran
amendment
does
not
waive
the
united
states'
immunity
to
administrative
proceedings
as
compared
to
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
in
nevada,
that
there
was
a
filing
fee
in
administrative
proceedings.
but
there
also
was
a
separate
track
for
the...
a
water
right
suit
could
be
brought
in
court,
and
in
the
court
suits
a
judgment
for
costs
was
provided.
and,
of
course,
the
mccarran
amendment
put
the
united
states
on
the
track
of
the
judicial
proceedings
in
those
contexts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
that's...
that
might
be.
i
think,
as
a
general
matter,
we
cannot
presume
that
the
congress
was
familiar
with
the
17
different
sets
of
state
laws
that
were
in
effect.
they're
available
in
the
exhibits
that
idaho
provided
in
these
proceedings
and
they're
quite
voluminous,
and
it's
difficult
to
believe
that
the
congres
was
really
aware
of
all
the
different
procedures
there.
and
i
think
they
were
probably
thinking
in
terms
of
general
judicial
procedures
instead.
and
as
i
said,
in
the
general
course
of
a
judicial
proceeding
the
plaintiff
pays
the
costs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
did
cite
that
case,
but
it
cited
it
in
the
context
that
everyone
should
be
brought
together
in
an
adjudication.
it
did
not
cite
it
in
the
context
of
paying
fees.
there's
no
mention
at
all
of
judicial
fees
in
the...
in
the
report
at
all.
that
simply
was
not
a
matter
of
discussion.
the
concern
in
the
legislation...
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
