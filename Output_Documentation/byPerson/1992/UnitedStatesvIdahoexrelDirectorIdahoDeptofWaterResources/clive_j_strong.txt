mr.
clive
j.
strong
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
mccarran
amendment,
in
clear
and
unequivocal
language,
requires
the
united
states
to
comply
with
those
state
laws
that
govern
the
conduct
of
general
stream
adjudications.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
we
believe
it
says
that
in
the
second
sentence
of
the
mccarran
amendment
when
it
says--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--it
says,
your
honor,
when
the
united
states...
when
a
party
to
any
such
suit
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable
or
that
the
united
states
is
not
amendable
thereto
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty.
it's
the
state's
contention--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
we
believe
the
reference
to
state
laws
has
to
refer
to
those
laws
that
govern
the
conduct
of
two
types
of
suits,
because
it
refers
back
to
the
first
sentence.
it
has
to
refer
to
suits
for
adjudication
and
suits
for
administration.
it's
those
bodies
of
law--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that
are
being
incorporated.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
it
depends--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--perhaps.
i
have
to
say
perhaps
because
it
depends
upon
how
the
water
right
is
acquired.
under
state
law
you
can
acquire
an
instream
flow,
and
the
united
states
has
gone
through
that
process
to
have
those
created.
you
can
also
have
a
water
right
reserved
under
federal
law,
for
instream
flow
purposes.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
that
was
the
point
that
i
was
attempting
to
make,
was
that
the
substantive
law
that
governs
the
type
of
water
right
is
dependent
upon
the
origin
of
what...
of
where
that
claim
comes
from.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
if
it's
a
federal
reserved
water
right,
then
federal
law--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--and
that's
not
our
contention,
your
honor.
our
contention
is
simply
that
those
procedures
and
substantive
parts
of
state
law
that
govern
the
conduct
of
general
stream
adjudications
and
suits
for
administration
is
what
the
second
sentence
refers
to.
to
give
you
an
example
of
the
problem
that
would
encompass
if
that
reference
was
not
in
the
procedure,
it
would
be
the
claims
filing
periods,
the
procedures
that
are
all
set
forth
by
statute...
and
you
have
to
understand
that
in
western
states
the
general
stream
adjudications
are
not
a
creature
of
court,
but
rather
a
creature
of
statute.
all
the
aspects
of
those
proceedings
are
governed
by
those
state
statutory
procedures.
absent
a
waiver
as
to
those
state
laws,
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
apply
its
statutory
procedures
to
the
united
states.
and
that's
the
contention
that
we
have
before
the
court,
is
that
it's
necessary
to
have
that
waiver
and
the
second
sentence
reaches
those
instances.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
if
you
accept
the
united
states'
interpretation
that
it
only...
that
the
second
sentence
only
extends
to
those
laws
governing
the
acquisition
of
water
rights,
then
it
would
be
rendering
meaningless
the
same
phrase
with
respect
to
suits
for
administration.
because
in
suits
for
administration,
the
issue
is
not
the
acquisition
of
a
state
water
right,
it's
a
question
of
how
the
decree
is
going
to
be
administrated.
and
for
example,
the
futile
call
doctrine,
which
says
that
if
a
senior
water
right
could
call
for
water
but
by
calling
for
that
water
there
would
not
be
sufficient
water
to
meet
the
purposes
of
that
water
right,
you
could
not
exercise
it
against
a
junior
water
user.
that
provision
has
to
be
incorporated,
otherwise
you
would
not
be
able
to
administer
the
particular
decrees.
so
what
we're
contending
is
simply
that
the
state
laws
must
refer
to
those
bodies
of
law
that
deal
directly
with
administration
and
adjudication
of
water
rights.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
our
contention
is
that
as
to
the
laws
that
govern
the
determination
of
those
water
rights,
it
will
be
based
upon
either
federal
or
state
law.
but
in
the
context
of
making
those
determinations,
the
mccarran
amendment
is
a
procedural
statute
that
was
designed
to
allow
the
states
to
apply
those
laws
that
govern
the
conduct
of
their
adjudications
to
the
united
states.
and
in
this
instance,
it
allows
the
imposition
of
filing
fees,
because
filing
fees
are
part
and
parcel
of
those
procedures.
one
of
the
reasons
the
mccarran
amendment
was
enacted
was
to
ensure
the
availability
of
the
comprehensive
state
proceedings.
those
proceedings
originally
started
out
as
a
quite
title
action
in
which
there
was
an
adversarial
relationship,
but
over
time
the
western
states
developed
a
specialized
procedure
that
moved
away
from
that
process
and
instead
developed
a
process
that's
more
akin
to
an
interpleader
action
or
an
in
rem
action,
in
which
all
parties
are
brought
in
who
may
have
a
claim
to
that
resource.
and
by
bringing
them
all
into
the
case,
then
everyone
is
able
to
have
certainty
that
the
water
rights
that
are
decreed
in
that
adjudication
are
final.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
i'm
saying
that
if--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
if
i
might
take
a
moment
to
explain.
when
the
united
states
acquires
a
water
right
pursuant
to
state
law,
in
accordance
with
the
historic
policy
of
congress
that
this
court
has
recognized,
the
united
states
by
voluntarily
acquiring
a
water
law
under
state
law,
submits
to
the
procedures
and
substance
for
the
definition
of
that
water
right.
absent
those...
those
procedures,
there
would
be
no
water
right
for
the
united
states
to
have.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
contending
that.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
the
contention
i'm
making--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
is
that
if
a
water
right
is
acquired
pursuant
to
state
law
under
the
historical
policy
of
deference
to
state
water
law,
the
united
states,
by
the
acquisition
of
that
water
right,
has
already
submitted
itself
to
the
substantive
laws
governing
the
acquisition
of
that
water
right.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
exactly,
your
honor.
the
waiver
wasn't
even
necessary.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
point
that
we're
attempting
to
make,
is
the
mccarran
amendment
is
not
a
substantive
statute
and
it
doesn't
create
water
rights.
it
recognizes
that
a
state
may
have
the
ability,
by
this
waiver,
to
adjudicate
those
water
rights.
and
the
substantive
rules
that
govern
the
actual
acquisition
of
those
water
rights
have
already
been
established
long
before
you
ever
get
to
the
adjudication.
when
you
get
to
the
adjudication,
you're
simply
determining
the
relationship
of
the
rights
as
with
respect
to
one
another.
and
the
benefits
of
the
state
system
that
congress
deferred
to,
i
think
really
informs
this
particular
statute.
because,
as
i
was
suggesting,
it's
an
in
rem
action
where
all
parties,
whether
you
have
a
water
right
or
not,
are
brought
in
to
make
sure
that
the
final
decree
is
binding
on
everyone.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
it's
a
very
complicated
process
where
everyone
in
a
state
has
to
be
served
who
has
potential
interest.
once
that
service
is
done,
then
you
have
to
take
all
of
the
claims
and
relate
them
to
one
another.
in
the
snake
river
basin
adjudication,
for
example,
the
trial
court,
with
the
assistance
of
the
department
of
water
resources,
will
have
to
evaluate
120,000
claims.
those
claims
will
all
be
consolidated
into
one
single
report
that
will
list
where
those
water
rights
are
from
an
area
that's
the
size
of
the
state
of
massachusetts,
new
hampshire,
vermont,
and
new
york
combined,
and
say
how
they
relate
to
one
another.
then
the
parties
come
in
and
file
objections
to
that
report.
that
report
frames
what
issues
are
in
dispute.
it
allows
an
efficiency
in
the
process
that
would
not
otherwise
exist
in
the
traditional
quiet
title
action
where
every
party
would
be
responsible
for
conducting
those
very
activities
that
the
state,
through
the
use
of
the
filing
fees,
has
been
able
to
consolidate
in
the
director
and
make
the
proceeding
more
efficient.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
the
idaho
proceeding
was
structured
by
the
legislature
to
require
those
who
benefit,
the
claimants,
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
that
proceeding.
and
i
might
add,
it
includes
the
state
of
idaho.
every
claim
that
the
state
of
idaho
submits
by
its
other
agencies,
it's
required
to
pay
a
filing
fee.
the
director
is
not
a
claimant
in
the
action.
he
has
no
water
rights.
but
if
the
state
of
idaho
has
a
water
right
that
it
wants
to
put
forward
in
a
proceeding,
it
has
to
pay
the
filing
fee.
and
contrary
to
the
united
states'
assertion,
those
instream
flow
claims
that
they
assert
are
so
large
are
applied
against
the
state
of
idaho
as
well
as
the
united
states.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
the
state--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
the
state
of
idaho
has
paid
in
excess
of
$3
million
for
instream
flow
claims
in
the
adjudication
up
to
this
point
in
time.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
65
percent
of
the
state
of
idaho
is
owned
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
that
would
be
total
federal
holdings
within
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes.
your
honor,
turning
back
to
the
point
of
the
filing
fees
and
why
they're
a
critical
part
of
the
process,
when
congress
enacts
a
general
waiver,
and
our
contention
is
that
the
mccarran
amendment
is
a
general
waiver,
it
waives
sovereign
immunity
as
to
ordinary
incidents
of
those
procedures
or
proceedings.
and
in
this
case,
because
of
the
structure
of
the
statutory
procedures,
the
filing
fees
are
an
integral
part
of
that.
indeed,
in
1916
in
the
pacific
live
stock
v.
lewis
case,
this
court
specifically
examined
a
system,
that
was
similar
to
idaho's,
in
the
state
of
oregon
in
which
a
variable
fee
was
charged
for
claimants
to
have
their
water
rights
adjudicated
in
the
oregon
comprehensive
adjudication
procedure.
and
the
court
found
that
the
imposition
of
these
fees
was
an
appropriate
action
by
the
state
because
of
the
benefits
received
by
the
claimants
from
the
services
provided
by
the
state
engineer
in
those
adjudications.
the
importance
of
that
case
comes,
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
references
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
congressional
report
that
was
submitted
in
conjunction
with
the
mccarran
amendment.
in
senate
report
755,
the
report
specifically
refers
to
the
pacific
live
stock
v.
lewis
case
as
an
example
of
the
type
of
proceedings
that
this...
that
congress
intended
to
reach
within
the
context
of
a
general
stream
adjudication.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
just
a
second.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
it...
unfortunately,
your
honor,
it's
been
referred
to
in
two
different
ways,
pacific
live
stock
v.
lewis,
and
in
the
congressional
report
as
pacific
live
stock
v.
oregon.
it's
cited
at
pages
33,
34,
44,
and
47.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
the
state's
contention
is
simply
that
the
mccarran
amendment
intended
to
provide
flexibility
to
the
states
in
the
way
they
conduct
these
general
stream
adjudications.
and
contrary
to
the
united
states'
assertion,
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran
amendment
these
were
not
normally
recovered
by
judgments
for
costs.
indeed,
an
examination
of
those
statutes
will
show
that
in
the
states
of
oregon,
arizona,
and
nevada,
variable
filing
fees
were
used;
in
the
states
of
washington,
colorado,
and
california,
fixed
fees
were
used;
and
in
other
states,
the
fees
were
simply
apportioned.
the
director
was
not
a
part
of
those
particular
adjudications,
but
was
invited
by
the
court
to
come
in
as
a
special
expert,
and
then
the
court
apportioned
those
fees
amongst
all
parties.
and
so
rather
than
the
uniformity
of
a
judgment
for
costs
as
a
way
to
recover
these
costs
in
1952,
the
state
of
the
body
of
law
shows
that
it
was
quite
differing
aspects
in
all
states
of
how
those
particular
costs
or
expenses
were
recovered.
and
the
point--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
it's
not
entirely
correct.
the
way
it
worked
in
idaho
in
1952
was
that
the
state
engineer
was
invited
into
the
proceeding
by
the
court,
and
he
would
make
an
estimate
of
the
expenses
that
he
would
incur
in
preparing
the
director's
report.
once
those
expenses
were
calculated,
he
would
submit
those
to
the
state
auditor
who
would
take
them
to
the
board
of
examiners
for
evaluation
and
then
finally
that
would
be
referred
back
to
the
court.
the
court,
at
the
end
of
the
case,
would
enter
an
order
apportioning
those
expenses,
and
then
they
would
become
a
lien
upon
the
property.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
we
don't
agree
that
that's
what
was
intended
by
the
word
judgment
for
costs.
we
believe
that--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
there
would
be
an
order
entered,
and
i
guess
you
could
call
that
a
judgment
if
you
wanted.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
and
it
became...
automatically,
by
statute,
it
was
made
a
lien
upon
the
property,
was
the
way
it
worked.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
i
believe
you're
correct,
your
honor.
that
in...
in
the
statute
somewhere--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
and
not
just
a
different
label,
but
a
different
procedure
entirely.
and
again
pointing
back
to
the
mccarran
amendment,
there's
nothing
in
the
mccarran
amendment
that
specifically
excepts
out
from
the
general
waiver
as
to
those
state
laws
governing
the
conduct
of
general
stream
adjudications,
filing
fees.
and
congress
is
presumed
to
have
known
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran
amendment
of
the
state
of
the
laws
that
it
was
incorporating
through
this
body.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
i--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe,
in
our
interpretation
of
what
the
term
"judgment
for
costs"
means,
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
the
state's
contention
is
that
judgment
for
costs
is
a
term
of
art
that
means
the
imposition
of
the
expenses
incurred
by
a
prevailing
party
on
an
opposing
party.
in
this
instance,
the
united
states
has
not
been
asked
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
prevailing
party.
in
no
way
is
the
director
a
claimant
in
the
proceeding.
in
no
way
does
the
director
get
any
relief
from
the
proceeding.
he
simply
provides
a
service,
services
that
are
provided
by
governmental
unit
or
fee.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
the...
in
the
context
of
a
general
stream
adjudication,
that's
right,
they
expect
to
prevail
and
have
a
water
right.
and
they
expect
not
only
that
they
will
prevail
as
to
their
own
water
right,
but
they
may
be--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
right.
but
the
director
is
not
a
prevailing
party.
the
director
is
simply
providing
a
service.
his
service
is
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
facilitate
adjudication.
in
absence--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
the
cost
provision
had
no
meaning.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
the
meaning
it
had
was
to
refer
to
those
instances
where
the
claimants...
and
you
have
to
think
of
the
adjudication.
it
has
the
claimants,
with
a
nominal
party
bringing
the
action,
where
the
claimants,
as
between
themselves,
were
suing
one
another
over
whether
they
had
a
valid
water
right.
that,
in
our
opinion,
is
what
the
judgment
for
costs
provision
was
intended
to
reach,
to
prevent
the
united
states
from
having
119,000
other
claimants
come
in
and
try
to
impose
their
costs
in
perfecting
their
water
right
against
the
united
states.
on
the
other
hand,
we
don't
believe
the
congress
intended
to
prevent
a
special
expert,
a
court-appointed
expert
in
this
instance,
to
be
able
to
recover
the
expenses
that
they
incurred
in
providing
a
service
that
is
of
uniform
benefit
to
every
single
claimant.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
let
me
set
the
record
straight
on
that,
because
it's
substantially
different
than
as
portrayed
by
the
united
states.
there
is
a
clear
division
as...
stated
as
what
the
united
states
serves
in
many
different
capacities.
it
serves
in
the
capacity
of
a
claimant
and
also
serves
in
the
capacity
of
a
special
expert.
with
respect
to
what
the
director's
doing
in
this
adjudication,
the
expenses
that
are
being
covered
out
of
that
account
are
the
service
of
process
that
the
director
served
on
all
people
for
the
benefit
of
the
claimants.
if
that
had
not
been
done,
you
would
have
had
individual
claimants
trying
to
join
people
and
you
would
not
have
a
comprehensive
determination.
450,000
claims.
the
director
also
prepares
a
report.
he
goes
through
and
he
takes
the
claims
that
are
submitted.
he
reviews
them
against
the
files
that
he
has
in
his
own
records.
he
reviews
them
against
the
hydrologic
information
that's
available.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'll
give
a
much
shorter
response.
yes,
some
salaries
are
being
paid,
but
those
salaries
are
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
director's
report
and
doing
the
services
that
every
single
claimant
would
benefit
from.
if
the
director
does
not
perform
those
services,
then
the
individual
claimants
would
have
to
perform
those
services
in
absence
of
him
doing
it.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
in...
private
claimants
have
paid...
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
to
my
recollection
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
$15
million.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor.
those--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--no,
your
honor.
idaho's
contemplation
is
that
the
services
that
are
being
provided
by
the
director
will
carry
through
and
form
the
director's
report,
which...
from
which
objections
are
filed.
once
people
then
make
objections
to
that
report,
they
will
each
be
responsible
for
whatever
expenses
they
incur,
including
the
state
of
idaho,
in
pressing
their
claim
forward
against
another
claimant.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor.
under
the
mccarran
amendment--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--okay,
your
honor
the
point
i
was
getting
ready
to
make,
as
to
the
united
states
the
mccarran
amendment
proviso
would
preclude
the
imposition
of
those
judgment
for
costs
as
between
one
claimant
against
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
the
court
from
imposing
a
judgment
for
costs
as
between
two
private
claimants
in
this
adjudication.
and,
in
fact,
that
is
routinely
done.
as
claimants
fight
with
one
another,
if
one
prevails
they
can
recover
expenses.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
yes,
your
honor,
the
director
defends
it.
and
let's
define
what
defend
means.
he--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--he
explains
what
his
report
says.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
no,
your
honor,
the
director
is
not
opposing
the
claim.
the
director
is
serving
in
the
capacity
of
a
special
expert.
his
role
is
simply
to
provide
the
court
with
the
information
that
he
has
gathered
from
the
investigation
of
the
claims
and
the
hydrologic
information.
now,
that's
his
sole
purpose.
he
doesn't
have
any
interest
or
stake
in
the
outcome.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
under
the
idaho
system,
the
way
it
is
now,
we
would
contend
that--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--and
i
would
expect
will
be
called
by
the
united
states
and
by
all
the
other
parties,
as
it
serves
their
interest
in
presenting
their
particular
case.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
that
case
was
decided
in
1916.
at
that
time
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
was
not
in
place.
the
point
that
i
made
was
in
the
senate
report
755,
that
case
is
cited
as
an
example
of
the
type
of
adjudications
that
the
mccarran
amendment
was
intended
to
reach.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
obviously
words
can
be
construed
in
different
ways.
what
we
have
been
able
to
discern,
though,
from
looking
at
the
mccarran
amendment
language
specifically,
that
in
order
to
apply
the
state
procedures
there
has
to
be
a
waiver.
if
there
is
no
wavier,
then
the
state
has
no
ability
to
go
forward
with
its
adjudications.
that's
the
only
plausible
reading
you
can
give
to
the
second
sentence.
if
you
give
it
any
other
reading,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
the
state
to
conduct
its
general
stream
adjudications
because
those
are
statutory
creatures
and
absent
a
waiver
of
the
supremacy
clause,
they
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
united
states.
so
if
you
give
it
the
only
plausible
construction--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
what
the
idaho
adjudication
statutes
and
all
other
statutes
do
is
to
compel
the
united
states
to
submit
a
claim
at
a
specific
point
in
time,
pursuant
to
a
specific
procedure.
if
that
law
is
not
applicable
to
the
united
states,
then
there
is
no
way
to
force
the
united
states
to
file
its
claims.
it
would
be
back
to...
what
the
united
states
is
suggesting
is
that
it
can
pick
and
choose
which
procedures
are
going
to
be
applicable
to
it
in
the
conduct
of
the
adjudication.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
if...
if
you
take
that
position,
then
on
basis...
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
subject
the
united
states
to
the
judicial
procedures,
the
simple
joinder
of
the
united
states.
but
what
in
that
waiver
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
waiver
of
the
intergovernmental
immunity
provisions
regarding
state
laws,
the
second
aspect
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
i
see
nothing
in
the
first
sentence
that
would
support
that
conclusion.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
your
honor,
they
have
suggested
that
the
fees
are
unreasonably
high.
this
case
has
gone
forward
based
upon
summary
judgment
motions.
the
united
states'
claims
had
not
been
filed
until
last
week.
and
so
on
its
face...
the
court
has
ruled
on
its
face
that
the
services
that
are
being
provided
are
reasonably
related
to
the
fee.
now
if,
upon
receipt
of
those
particular
claims--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
if...
if,
on
the
other
hand,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this
point.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
once
the
claims
are
filed,
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
the
fees
relate
to
the
services
being
provided,
then
the
united
states
will
have
an
opportunity
to
go
back
and
object
to
that.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
it's
required
to
pay
it
up
on
the
filing,
but
they
could
object
at
the
time
of
the
filing
to
the
payment
of
that
fee,
if
they
believe
that
it
is
going
to
be
unfair
or
unreasonable
based
upon
the
facts.
the
only
thing
we've
tried
so
far
is
this
case
based
upon--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--they
might
try
it
that
way,
or
the
other
option
would
be
to
bring
another
mandamus
action
saying
that
based
upon
the
claims
they're
filing,
that
the
fees
are
not
rationally
related
to
the
services
being
provided.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
it's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
i
would
be
surprised--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--well,
i
would
invite
you
out
to
enjoy
the
environs
of
idaho.
the
point
that
we
would
like
to...
to
make
here
is
simply
that
these
are
complex
proceedings
that
absent
the
ability
of
the
states
to--
mr.
clive
j.
strong
--we
have
a
lot
of
dissents
in
idaho.
the
point
that
we
would
really
like
to
close
with
the
court
is
simply
that
these
are
complex
proceedings,
that
the
state
engineer
has
unique
knowledge
and
skills
that
need
to
be
used
in
these
adjudications
if
we're
going
to
complete
them
in
a
timely
fashion.
otherwise,
we
will
revert
back
to
the
situation
where
we're
doing
simply
in
rem
actions
where
every
single
party
is
going
to
be
going
out
preparing
their
own
reports,
doing
their
own
investigations,
all
at
the
same
time
that
everyone
else
is
doing
the
same
thing,
and
the
court's
going
to
have
to
sort
through
a
plethora
of
paper.
the
procedures
that
the
states
have
developed
and
the
congress
recognized
avoid
that
difficulty.
they
develop
a
uniform
procedure
for
the
application
of
state
laws.
mr.
clive
j.
strong
thank
you.
