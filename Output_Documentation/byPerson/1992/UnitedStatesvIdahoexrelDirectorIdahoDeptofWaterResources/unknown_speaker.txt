unknown
speaker
volume.
unknown
speaker
volume.
and
the
more
water
you
claim,
the
more
you
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
that
includes
the
claim...
the
kind
of
claims
the
united
states
makes.
unknown
speaker
you
say...
suggest
that
determining
instream
flow
claims
is
not
more
complicated
than
just...
just
adjudicating
prior
appropriation
claims.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
you...
i'm...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
got
something
you
said
a
little
while
ago.
i
thought
you
said
that
the
cost
proviso,
which
is
just
an
appendage
to
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
deals
with
the
entry
of
judgments,
doesn't
have
any
relevance
to
the
first
sentence
in
the
section.
from
that
i
inferred...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
the
united
states
is
not
taking
the
position
that
the
filing
fees
in
this
case,
which
are
assessed
before
any
judgment's
entered,
are
covered
by
the
language
in
the
proviso.
unknown
speaker
so,
specifically,
you
rely
on
the
proviso
only
to
sort
of
illuminate
the
meaning
of
the
whole
statute
as
further
evidence
of
the
fact
that
there's
not
a
sufficiently
specific
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
rather
than
arguing
that
this
is
covered
by
the
proviso.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
i
assume
i
can
agree
with
you
on
the...
or,
i
hope
i
can
agree
with
you,
because
you're
going
to
have
trouble
otherwise,
on
the...
on
the
fees
without
agreeing
with
you
on
the
procedures.
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
think...
you
think
the
two
go
together
inevitably.
unknown
speaker
see,
i
don't
see
how
sovereign
immunity
applies
to
the
procedures
at
all?
i
mean
how
does
sovereign
immunity
apply
to
the
procedures?
unknown
speaker
right.
that's
fair
enough.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
your
argument
as
to
the
express
waiver
by
the
united
states
of
immunity
from
fees
is
no
stronger
than
the
argument
that
you're
not
subject
to
procedures
because
the...
there's
no
express
waiver
as
to
procedures?
unknown
speaker
so
do
i.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
i
think
to...
if
you
had
said
that
you
have
a
right
to
challenge
an
idaho
rule
that
says
you
notice
a
deposition
a
certain
amount
of
days
in
advance,
that
you
go
just
through
the
whole
idaho
code
of
procedure
saying
we
have
to
look
at
sovereign
immunity
in
these
of
these
after
there's
been
a
consent
to
joinder,
i
think
that's
rather
farfetched.
unknown
speaker
i
think
just
being...
just
being
joined
in
a
state
suit
for
a...
for
a
watershed...
water
rights
adjudication
certainly
doesn't
determine
what
the
applicable
law
is.
you're
not...
certainly
mccarran
didn't
say
that
the
united
states
can
be
joined
and
it
would...
and
their
water
rights
would
be
governed
totally
by
state
law.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
didn't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
because,
probably
most
states...
at
least
i
know
one
state
that
doesn't
recognize
instream
flow
rights,
but
the
united
states
claims
them
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
mccarran
amendment
had
never
been...
been
passed
and
the
united
states
brought
a
suit
in
federal
court
to
adjudicate
its
water
rights
in
a
certain
stream
in
the
state
of
idaho.
i
don't
suppose
you
could
have
made
the
state
of
idaho
pay
for
the
costs
of
the
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
and
the
united
states
would
have
had
to
pay
its
own
expenses
for--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you
say
fees
generally.
now,
do
you
distinguish
at
all
between
a
uniformly
applied
appearance
fee
to
all
defendants
and
the
kind
of
very
expensive
fees
that
were
charged
here,
that
are
based
partly
on
reimbursing
the
state
for
the
cost
of
litigation?
unknown
speaker
what
does
idaho...
or
does
it
identify
the
kinds
of
fees...
or
what
do
they...
how
do
they
justify
these
fees
and
what
are
they
supposed
to
reimburse
the
state
of
idaho
for?
unknown
speaker
expenses
that
the
united...
if
the
united
states
had
brought
the
suit
in
federal
court,
expenses
that
the
united
states
would
have
had
to
put
up
with.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
do
they...
do
they
hire
private
counsel
to
represent
them?
unknown
speaker
oh,
really.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
expenses
and
salaries
that
are
related
to
adjudicating
united
states
claims,
not
everybody
else's.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
minear.
mr.
strong,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
that?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
think
that
state
law...
that
the
entire
body
of
state
is
what...
is
to
applied
in
adjudicating
the
united
states
water
rights.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
substantive
law
that's
applied...
say
the
united
states
wants
to
have
established
a
instream
flow
right.
is
state
law
going
to
govern
that?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
the
claim
is
that
this
is
a
reserved
right,
why
it's
going
to
be
adjudicated
under
federal
law
rather
than
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
then--
unknown
speaker
--then
the
mccarran
act
doesn't
really
say
that
the
united
states...
that
this
whole
proceeding
is
to
be
governed
by
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strong,
do
you
think
it
was
the
intent
of
the
mccarran
amendment
to
change
in
any
way
the
substantive
law
governing
federal
water
rights?
take
the
winters
case,
you
know,
something
quite
controversial
as
to
reserved
rights
on
reservations.
do
you
think
the
mccarran
amendment
contemplated
that
idaho
might
come
up
with
a
rule
that
would
overturn,
say,
the
winters
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strong,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
your
position,
because
it's
a
strong
point
if
it's...
if
it's
correct.
you
say
that
under
the
second
sentence
it
is
impossible
that
the
phrase
"waived
any
right
to
plead
that
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable.
"
it's
impossible
that
that
could
apply
to
the
state's
substantive
law
concerning
water
rights.
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
say
that
no...
no
state
laws
concerning
water
rights
effect
the
government?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
substance,
the
substance.
you
contend
that
in
these
proceedings
the
united
states
is
not
bound
by
any
substantive
state
water
law.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well
that's
what--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
you
say
this
water...
this
wavier
is
unnecessary
because
it's
already
there.
unknown
speaker
well
that's
a
much
weaker
argument,
i
think.
okay,
i
got
ya,
all
right.
well,
that's...
that's
the
way
that,
usually,
appropriated
rights
are
acquired.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strong,
the
united
states
says
that
the
sort
of
fees
that
you
intend
to
charge
it
could
amount
to
as
much
as
$10
million.
these
don't
certainly
sound
like
ordinary
filing
fees
in
the
sense
one
ordinarily
uses
that.
is
the
idaho
system
structured
so
as
to
make
the
litigants
pay
for
the
entire
cost
of
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
because
i
suppose
they
have...
does
idaho
law
provide
for
instream
flow
rights?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
idaho
has...
owns
a
lot
of
property
along
the
snake
river.
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
idaho
land
is
owned
by
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
does
that
include
indian
reservations?
unknown
speaker
including
indian
lands.
unknown
speaker
where...
where
is
that
cited
in
your
brief,
the
pacific
live
stock
v.
lewis?
unknown
speaker
i'm
looking
through
the
index.
i
don't
see
it.
perhaps
i
have
the
wrong
first
name
or
something.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it...
okay,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strong,
on
that
point
what
about
idaho?
was
it...
is
it
not
correct
that
idaho's
procedure
was
to
treat
them
as
part
of
the
judgment
for
costs?
unknown
speaker
but
it...
but
would
they
not
be
called
a
judgment
for
costs?
wouldn't...
wouldn't
the
judgment
for
costs
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
encompass
the
expenses
that
are
now
covered
by
filing
fees?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand
that.
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
back
in
'52,
i
guess
it
was,
that's
the
way
idaho
collected
the
money
that
it
needed
to
perform
the
same
function
that's
now
performed
by
the
filing
fees.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
the
court
would
call
it,
isn't
it,
judgment
for
costs,
in
idaho?
unknown
speaker
and
wasn't
the
word
costs
used
somewhere
in
describing
that
amount
of
money
in
idaho...
as
a
matter
of
idaho
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
that
that
was
not
true
in
oregon,
arizona,
and
nevada
and
these
other
states.
unknown
speaker
they
had
a
different
label
for
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you...
do
you
acknowledge
that
the
costs
provision
here
would
have
made
the
prior
idaho
costs
not
payable
by
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
did
it
cover
the
prior
idaho
system
or
not,
in
'52?
unknown
speaker
and
the
united
states...
i
suppose
most
claimants,
the
majority
of
the
claimants
expect
to
prevail
and
have
a
water
right.
unknown
speaker
at
least
a
lot
of
them
are
going
to
prevail,
including
the
united
states,
and
they
will
be
awarded
water
rights
and
they're
prevailing
parties,
if
you
have
to
find
somebody
who's
a
prevailing
party.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
you
don't...
who
paid
these
costs,
then,
if...
if
it
was
understood
that
almost
everybody
wins,
who
loses
and
pays
the
costs?
i
don't
understand
that.
you're
saying
the
costs
provision
had
no
meaning
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
had
a...
it
had
an
easy
meaning
if
it
applied
to
this
kind
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
salaries
that
the
united
states
mentioned?
does
the
fee
purport
to
cover
various
salaries,
all
the
salaries
of
people
who...
state
employees
who
work
on
this
adjudication?
unknown
speaker
well,
justice
white
asked
you
whether
the
salaries
of
public
officials
in
idaho
were
being
paid
by...
i
think
you
can
answer
without
the
long
recitation.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
notion
about...
about
what
the
total
fees
charged
private
claimants
in
this
water
adjudication
would
have
been?
you've
said
that...
you've
said
that
the
state
of
idaho
has
already
paid
$3
million.
unknown
speaker
is
any
of
that
$15
going
to
be
used
to
pay
outside
experts,
independent
experts?
unknown
speaker
so
that...
it's
the...
the
idaho
procedure
is
that
there
will
be
a
further
assessment
at
the
end
of
the
case
for
the
cost
of...
of
expert
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
those
fees...
excuse
me.
no,
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry.
are
those
fees
going
to
be...
the
expert
witness'
fees
at
stage
two
going
to
be
subject
to
a...
a
cost
assessment
by
the...
by
the
idaho
courts,
depending
on
how
the
case
turns
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
let
me
just
go
to
my
final
question,
what
is
left,
then,
of
the
proviso?
what
work
is
it
going
to
accomplish,
on
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well
when
the...
when
the
report
of
the
director
comes
in,
people
can
attack
it.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the...
does
the
director
defend
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
united
states
files
a
big
objection
to
the
report
and
the
director
may
incur
a
lot
of
expense
defending
against
that
attack,
so
the
united
states
is
supposed
to
pay
the
salaries
that...
of
the
people
opposing
their
claim.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
the
director's
role
isn't
finished
when
he
files
his
report.
you
don't
suggest
that.
unknown
speaker
the
director
and
his
helpers
will...
would
be
available
as
witnesses
and
probably
would
call
themselves
as
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strong,
i've
been
glancing
over
this
report
of
pacific
live
stock
company
against
the
oregon
water
board.
it
doesn't
appear
to
me
the
united
states
was
a
party
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
so
how
does
it
support
your
position
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strong,
the
text
of
the
statute
says
the
united
states,
when
a
party
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable.
i
mean
it
says...
it
doesn't
say
the
state
laws
shall
be
applicable.
it
says
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
they
are
inapplicable.
that
suggests
to
me
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
laws
that
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation,
that
would
the
subject
of
a
pleading.
i
don't
know
that
you'd
file
a
pleading
that
would
say
i
am
not
subject
to
the...
to
the
filing
fees.
that'd
be
a
very
strange
pleading,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
wait,
wait.
the
supremacy
clause
only
prevents
your
compelling
the
united
states
to
do
something,
to
appear,
to
pay
money,
to
do
various
things,
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
would
say
that
that
is
all
covered
by
the
first
part
of
it.
consent
is
given
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
defendant.
i
would
say
that
the
obligation
to
compel
with
all
those
procedural
rules
that
go
with
the
suit,
that's
the
waiver
for
that.
i
don't
have
to
resort
to
the...
to
the
later
one
to
achieve
that.
unknown
speaker
has
the
united
states
at
any
time
in
this
litigation
suggested
that
your...
that
your
fees
are
unreasonably
high,
or
is
their
only
argument
of
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
the
only
issue
brought
before
us
is
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
had
to
pay
the
fee
up
on
the
filing.
unknown
speaker
sort
of
like
paying
your
tax
first
and
asking
for
a
refund
later.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
one
last
question.
it
doesn't
really
relate
to
your
case,
just
a
point
of
curiosity.
one
of
the
justices
in
his
opinions
chose
to
follow
the
dissent
in
one
of
our
cases
rather
than
the
majority.
does
that
happen
very
often
in
idaho?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
different
out
there.
i
wasn't
sure.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it's
nice
to
know
they
read
dissents
in
idaho.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
strong.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
mr.
minear,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
into
your
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
does
the
united
states
think
it
would
be
permissible...
this
is
a
sovereign
immunity
case,
basically.
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
court
to
look
at
legislative
history
to
try
and
unravel
this
puzzle?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
but
do
you
think
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
impermissible.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
also
before
you
get
started,
so
then
you'll
just
have
a
lot
of
free
time
with
no
questions
after
we're
all
done.
[laughter]
what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
whether
that
clause
1,
the
second
clause
1,
the
united
states...
in
the
second
sentence.
unknown
speaker
do
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
a
submission
of
the
united
states
to
substantive
state
laws?
and
if
so,
what
substantive
state
laws?
unknown
speaker
not...
not
the
procedures
of
the
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
the
procedures
for
obtaining
a
water
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
is
it
remarkable
that
the
reference
to
fees
was
omitted
from
this
proviso,
whereas
it
was
included
in
the
language
from
the
general
statute
that
you've
just
quoted?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
really
explain,
i
don't
think,
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
as
to
why
fees
were
later...
later
omitted.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
i
mean
they...
they
were
once
present
in
the
statute,
they
are
now
omitted.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
party
doesn't
collect
fees,
the
court
collects
fees.
and
a
party
may
charge
a
paid
fee
as
a
cost,
but
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
is
certainly
right
as
to
the
distinction
between
fees
and
costs,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
do
you...
you
implicitly,
then,
i
take
it,
dispute
mr.
strong's
representation
that
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
there
was
in
effect
in
idaho
and
other
western
states
the
practice
of
charging
fees
up
front.
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
no...
you
are
representing
that
so
far
you
know,
in
no
judicial
proceeding
were
fees
charged
up
front
like
this.
unknown
speaker
in
a
judicial
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
so,
in
any
case,
the
fees
were
not
comparable
to
these
fees.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
practice
in
nevada,
mr.
minear,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
and
senator
mccarran
might
be
familiar
with
those
procedures.
unknown
speaker
but
the
report
did
cite
that
oregon
case.
