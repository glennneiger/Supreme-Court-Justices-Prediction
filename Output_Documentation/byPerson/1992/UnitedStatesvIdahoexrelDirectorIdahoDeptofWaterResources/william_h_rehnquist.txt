we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-190,
the
united
states
v.
idaho
on
the
relation
of
the
director
of
the
idaho
department
of
water
resource.
mr.
minear,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
sovereign
immunity
has
nothing
to
do
with...
with
due
process,
in
that
people
who
concededly
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
can
always
raise
a
due
process
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
now,
supposing
that
idaho
made
an
assessment
of
$100
on
everybody
who
is
making
an
appearance
for
the
first
time
in
a
judicial
proceeding
in
idaho,
and
that
was
applied
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
don't
think
there's
any
subsidiary
waiver
involved
when
it...
when
it
talks
about
being
joined
in
a
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
why
does
congress
say
at
the
end
of
this
that
it
shall
not
be
liable
for
costs,
if
it
wouldn't
have
been
without
the
provision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
