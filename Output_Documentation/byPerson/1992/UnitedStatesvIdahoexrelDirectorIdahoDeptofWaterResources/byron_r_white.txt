justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
minear,
the...
the
statute
permits
the
united
states
to
be
joined,
but
what
that
means
is
that
the...
that
there
can
be
a
general
adjudication
of
a...
of
water
rights
in
the
basin,
but
only...
and
what
it
means
is
that
if
the
united
states
wants
to
get
water
rights,
they
not
only
are
joined
but
if
they
did
not
come
in
and
file
a
claim,
they
would
have
no
water
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it...
you...
the
united
states
conceded
that
it
would
have
to
to
make
a
valid
water
right
claim
in
the
state
of
idaho.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
and
you
would
have
to
take
the
initiative.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
that
subsumes
compliance
with
some
rules
about
how
you
file
a
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
had
been
a
$5
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
united
states
is
not
being
subject
to
filing
fees
that
are
different
from
other
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no?
