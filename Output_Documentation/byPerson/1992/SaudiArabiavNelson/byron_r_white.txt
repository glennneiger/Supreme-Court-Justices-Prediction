justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
deny
that
there
was
any
commercial
activity
in
this
country
by
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
recruiting,
hiring
is
a
commercial
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
just
as
though
the...
saudi
arabia
sent
its
own
employees
over
here
to
recruit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what's
your
view
on
that,
whether
or
not
the
acts
of
the...
of
your
agent
can
be
attributed
to
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
contract
signed
in
miami?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
contract
of
employment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
who
signed
it
for...
there
just
wasn't
one
signature,
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
signed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
did
he...
and
hca
had
authority
to
sign
that
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
recruiter
for
saudi
arabia
in
this
country
affirmatively
misrepresented
certain
critical
facts
that
would
obtain
during
his
work
in
saudi
arabia.
would
you
say
that
saudi
arabia
would...
would
there
be
jurisdiction
over
saudi
arabia
on
a
misrepresentation
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
be
making
any
different
argument,
would
you,
if
mr.
nelson
didn't
perform
his
job
over
there?
and
let's
assume...
let's
just
concede
that
he
didn't
perform
well,
but...
and
rather
than
just
send
him
home,
they
put
him
in
the
jug
and
beat
him.
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so,
it's
just
sort
of
beside
the
point
that
he
really
did
his
job
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
a
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you...
i
thought
the
statute
said...
i
thought
you...
i
thought
your
theory
was
that
your
suit
was
based
on
a
commercial
activity
that
occurred
in
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
but...
and
you
say
the...
running
a
hospital
is
a
commercial
activity,
and
it
has
substantial
contacts
with
the
united
states.
is
that
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
are
the
substantial
contacts
with
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
rather
than
start
with
a
commercial
activity
and
going
up
the
line,
you
start
with
the
commercial
activity
of
running
a
hospital
and
coming
back
down
to...
you
have
to
trace
it.
your
substantial
contact
has
to
be
traced
to
the
recruitment.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
signing
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
he...
part
of
his
recruitment
went
on
in
saudi
arabia.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
he
didn't
ask
any
question
at
all
about
what
his
duties
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
gloss
in
advance.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
hospital
is
a
commercial
activity.
you
deny
that
there's
substantial
contacts
with
the
united
states.
