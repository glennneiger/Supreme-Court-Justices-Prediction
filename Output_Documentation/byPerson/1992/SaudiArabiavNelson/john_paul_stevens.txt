justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
clarifying
question?
if
there
were
a
breach
of
contract,
the
contract
having
been
entered
into
in
the
united
states
and
the
breach
occurring
in
saudi
arabia,
would
that...
an
action
based
on
that
breach
be
based
upon
the
contract
or
be
based
upon
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states
within
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
they
didn't
pay
his
salary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
you're
saying
it
would
be
based
upon
action,
but
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
because
it
was
not...
it
had
no
impact
on
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
position
on
that
particular
question
the
same
as
the
united
states',
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
read
one
footnote
in
their
brief
as
suggesting
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
the
case
i
posed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
i
read
one
footnote
in
their
brief
as
seeming
to
me
to
suggest
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
their
view
in
the
case
i
suggest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point?
would
the
case
be
different
if
instead
of
the
allegation
being
that
law
enforcement
authorities
had
been
used,
they
had
alleged
that
the
hospital
had
its
own
private
police
force
in
effect
that
could
discipline
people
for
whistle
blowing?
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
the
fact
that
you
have
law
enforcement
personnel
involved
really
isn't
a
critical
part
of
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so,
you
don't
draw
a
distinction
between
government-owned
hospitals
and
government
police
forces.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
would
you
just
clear
up
one
thing
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position?
supposing
they
hadn't
paid
him
10
months
later,
could
he
sue
the
government
for
that
in
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
you
don't
have
a
forum...
just
assume
you
have
a
naked
contract
without
a
forum
selection
clause
in
it,
and
a
breach
10
months
after
was
signed
in
the
united
states
by
failing
to
pay
in
saudi
arabia.
in
your
view
would
the
plaintiff
be
able
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
understand.
what's
your
answer
to
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
following
extensive
recruitment
activity,
you'd
still
say
the
same
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
you've
got
enough
contact
to
say
that
the
commercial
activity
was
in
the
united
states,
but
then
the
breach
is
in
saudi
arabia
by
failing
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
admit
that
the
failure
to
pay
would
be
sufficient
for
jurisdiction,
then
what
if
by
tortious
means
they
took
the
money
back
from
him
in
some
way?
they
beat
him
up
to
get...
to
extort
money
from
him
while
he's
employed.
that...
there
would
not
be
jurisdiction
then
i
take,
because
that
would
be
a
tort.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
that's
not
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
assumption
is
you
have
the
same
substantial
contacts,
and
they're
enough
to
support
a
suit
for
failure
to
pay
the
salary
10
months
after
the
man
goes
to
work
in
saudi
arabia.
my
question
then
is,
is
it
a
different
rule
if
a
tort
is
committed
in
the
course
of
the
employment
relationship
that
has
exactly
the
same
financial
impact
on
him
and
on
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
when
we
judge
whether
or
not
an
activity
is
commercial
in
nature,
do
we
look
to
the
standards
and
practices
of
the
international
business
community,
or
is
it
to
what
is
a
commercial
activity
here
in
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
we
look
to
what
is
commercial
activity
in
1976?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
perhaps
the
question
is
whether
piracy
is
commerce.
