justice
antonin
scalia
do
you--
--even
though
it's
based
upon
a
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
commercial
activity...
a
commercial
activity,
such
as
a
contract,
the
signing
and
performance
of
a
contract,
is
divisible
so
that
the
signing
of
the
contract
is
one
commercial
activity,
the
performance
of
the
contract
in
saudi
arabia
is
a
separate
commercial
activity
so
that
if
you
don't
pay
for
the
service
in
saudi
arabia,
that
is,
indeed,
a
commercial
activity,
but
it's
not
a
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
is
that
the
position
you
take?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
even
a
finer
line.
you're
drawing
the
line
between
the
recruitment
and
the
signing.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
with
respect
to
recruitment,
why
isn't
the...
why
isn't...
at
least
as
to
the
negligence
cause
of
action
here,
why
isn't
that
gravamen
based
upon
the
activity
in
the
united
states?
the
claim
made
is
that
your
client
failed
to
warn...
failed
to
warn...
that
there
was
a
danger
in
working
in
saudi
arabia.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
why
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
saudi
arabia
were
engaged
in
the
business
of
recruiting
workers
for
qatar,
and
the
same
thing
happened
here,
only
it
happened
in
qatar,
and
a
suit
is
brought
in
florida
claiming
negligence
in
failing
to
warn
the
recruitee
about
qatar
sometimes
engaging
in
this
kind
of
a
governmental
activity.
you
still
say
there's
no
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
saudi
arabia
is
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
say,
i
assume,
that
if
a
private
employer
did
the
same
thing
and
took
one
of
its
employees
into
the
back
room
and
had
him
beat
up
by
some
of
the
private
employer's
officers,
that
would
not
be
a
commercial
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
nature
of
it
is
not
commercial.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
governmental.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you're
a
police
force
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
the
government
argues
differently
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
i
mean,
if
there's
a
suit
saying
the
government
is
immune
for
the
tort
committed
by
a
coworker
in
the
federal
government,
you
couldn't
sue
the
government
for
failing
to
warn
that
your
coworker
may
be
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stevens,
suppose
the
hospital
supervisors
had
someone
that
they
had
hired
beat
up
because
he
was
dating
the
hospital
president's
daughter.
would
that
be
a
commercial
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
certainly
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
any
tort
committed
against
him
by
his
employer
is
commercial.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
still
within
my
hypothetical.
the
way
you
answered
that
hypothetical,
a
tort
is
committed
against
him
unrelated
to
his
employment
except
that
it
is
by
his
employer;
you
say
that's
a
commercial
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
world
as
being
divided
into
commerce
and
government.
it's
divided
into
commerce
and
noncommerce.
that's
what
the
act
says.
the
act
doesn't
create
a
dichotomy
between
commercial
and
governmental.
it
creates
a
dichotomy
between
commercial
and
noncommercial.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity,
not
whether
it
is
acting
in
a
governmental
or
nongovernmental,
whether
it's
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity.
and
you
say
so
long
as
you're
doing
something
to
your
employer...
employee,
you
are
always
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity.
that's
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
bracketed
by
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states.
it
says
based
on.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
bracketing
and
basing?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
two
are
the
same.
i
mean,
the
commercial
activity
has
to
be
a
commercial
activity
carried
on
in
the
united...
it
means
commercial
activity
carried
on
by
such
state
and
having
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
well,
you
have
to
change
your
answer
to
him.
i
mean,
you
answered
me
before
that
if
they
beat
him
up
because
he
was
dating
the
president's
daughter,
that
was
still
a
commercial
act,
and
i
assume
if
they
beat
him
up
because
he
made
a
misrepresentation
in
his
employment
application,
that's
an
easier
question
even.
you'd
say
you'd
still
have
a
cause
of
action
under
this
act.
you'd
say
that's
a
commercial
activity,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
cause
of
action.
is
it...
as
far
as
jurisdiction
under
this
act
is
concerned,
is
that
a
commercial
activity,
beating
him
up
because
he
made
a
misstatement
on
his
application
form?
is
that
a
commercial
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
commercial
activity.
and
so...
and
if
somebody
just
walked...
his
employer
came
in
and
shot
him
in
the
head,
that's
a
commercial
activity.
isn't
that
your
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
just
getting
more
and
more
complete
as
they
went
on.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it's
doubtless
true
that
when
you
have
a
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
case
in
front
of
you,
if
you
say...
if
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
act
was
not
a
commercial
act,
then
for
purposes
of
that
statute,
the
act
must
be
treated
as
an
act
of
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
making
the
inquiry
of
whether
it's
a
commercial
act
or
not,
i
don't
think
you
approach
it
with
the
mental
attitude
that
everything
in
the
world
has
to
be
either
a
commercial
act
or
a
governmental
act.
i
think
everything
in
the
world
is
either
a
commercial
act
or
not
a
commercial
act,
like
shooting
somebody
in
the
head,
for
instance.
i
don't
care
if
that's
done
in
the
course
of
a
contract
or
not.
that
seems
to
me
not
a
commercial
act.
it
may
not
be
a
governmental
act
either,
but
it's
a
commercial
act...
it's
not
a
commercial
act.
and
if
it's
not
a
commercial
act
and
the
suit
at
hand
is
a
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
suit,
having
determined
it's
not
a
commercial
act,
it's
an
act
of
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
i
asked.
is
that
a
commercial
activity
in
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--never
mind
whether
it's
between
nations
or
not.
by
a
private
party,
by
anybody
else,
is
price
fixing
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
a
commercial
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
a
commercial
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
burning
down
your
competitor's
store?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
lies...
the
line
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
lies
somewhere
between
the
sherman
act
and
arson.
