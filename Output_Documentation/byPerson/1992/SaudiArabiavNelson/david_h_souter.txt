justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
why
don't
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
duty
to
warn
about
what
a
third
party
might
do,
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
duty
to
warn
about
what
the
person
giving
the
warning
might
do?
i
thought
you
were
basing
your
argument
in
this
case
on
the
fact
that
we
simply
do
not...
tort
law
generally
does
not
recognize
a
duty
to
warn
of
one's
own
malevolence,
but
tort
law
does
recognize
a
duty
to
warn
of
risks
that
are
beyond
the
control
of
the
person
giving
the
warning.
and
yet,
you
don't
seem
to
accept
that
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
you
want
us
to
recognize.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
your
criterion
in
answering
justice
kennedy's
question
is
that
what's
commercial
or
not
depends
on
what
is
commercial
in
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
think
the
duty
to
warn
referred
to
a
duty
to
warn
of
anything
but
the
activities,
i.e.,
the
potentially
tortious
activities
of
the
arabian
government
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
there
is.
isn't
the
complaint
simply
that
there
was
a
failure
to
warn
of
what
you,
the
arabian
government,
might
do
if
you
got
mad?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
that
fall
within
any
recognized
category
of
tort?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
seems
to
me
you're
bending
over
backwards
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
make
an
argument
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
plausible.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
want
us
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
answer
to
my
question?
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
you
want
us
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
gives
you
a
problem
under
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
makes
a
distinction
between--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
doesn't
it
make
a
distinction
between
the
activity
and
the
motivation
for
the
activity?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
you
want
us
basically
to
disregard
that
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
your
claim...
would
you
have
a
cause
of
action,
even
on
your
own
theory,
if
they
beat
him
up
because
he
had
fraudulently
misrepresented
his
credentials?
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
answer
to
my
question
no?
you
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action
in
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
fact
is
you
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action,
and
the
only
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
one
and
the
only
reason
that
there
might
be
on
your
theory
jurisdiction
in
one
case
and
not
in
the
other
is
by
looking
to
the
motivation
for
the
act,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
tells
us
we
can't
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
look
to
the
motivation
to
the
act.
you're
now
saying
if
the
tort
feasor
is
an
employer
and
the
victim
is
an
employee,
that's
all
you
need
to
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
theory
that
you're
now
espousing,
that's
all
you
need
to
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
respondents,
a
married
couple
named
nelson,
filed
this
action
for
damages
for
personal
injury
against
the
petitioner's
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
saudi
hospital
and
the
hospital's
corporate
purchasing
agent.
that
nelsons'
alleged
the
injuries
resulting
from
the
saudi
government's
unlawful
detention
and
torture
of
the
respondent
scott
nelson
while
he
was
employed
as
a
safety
engineer
at
the
hospital,
and
from
the
petitioners'
negligent
failure
to
warn
up
of
the
possibility
of
severe
retaliatory
action
if
he
attempted
to
report
hospital's
safety
hazards.
the
district
court
dismissed
for
lack
of
subject-matter
restriction
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
which
generally
entitles
foreign
states
to
immunity
from
the
jurisdiction
of
united
states
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
nelsons'
action
to
fell
within
the
act's
exception
for
suit
based
upon
a
commercial
activity
by
the
foreign
state.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit
and
hold
that
the
act
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
over
the
nelsons'
suit.
under
the
restrictive
theory
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
which
the
act
codifies
the
saudi
government's
alleged
detention
and
torture
of
nelson
do
not
qualify
as
commercial
activities,
and
to
allow
that
nelsons'
to
proceed
alternatively
on
a
failure
of
warn
theory
with
effectively
toward
the
act
manifest
purpose.
the
case
is
reduced
something
less
than
complete
unanimity.
