mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
the
commercial
activity
exception
in
a
way
that
would
dramatically
curtail
the
sovereign
immunity
of
not
just
saudi
arabia,
but
the
entire
community
of
nations.
we
urge
this
court
to
correct
that
error,
an
error
that
could
prompt
other
nations
to
limit
the
united
states'
sovereign
immunity
in
their
courts.
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
saudi
arabia
is
immune
from
the
respondents'
claims
unless
those
claims
are
based
upon
a
commercial
activity
carried
on
in
the
united
states
by
the
foreign
state.
the
court
of
appeals
mistakenly
concluded
that
the
based
upon
requirement
was
satisfied
here
because
according
to
the
complaint,
saudi
arabia
recruited
mr.
nelson
in
the
united
states.
he
was
mistreated
abroad,
and
his
mistreatment
was
causally
related
to
his
employment.
the
problem
with
the
court's
reasoning
is
that
congress
did
not
use
that
court's
so-called
nexus
test
in
formulating
the
commercial
activity
exception.
congress
said
the
suit
must
be
based
upon
a
commercial
activity.
in
other
words,
the
commercial
activity
must
be
the
basis
of
foundation
for
the
legal
claim.
in
common
law
parlance,
the
complaint...
or
the
commercial
activity
must
provide
the
gist
or
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
although
recruitment
activities
can,
in
theory,
qualify
as
a
commercial
activity,
the
saudi
recruitment
activities
alleged
here
do
not
provide
a
basis
for
the
respondents'
claims
of
intentional
injury.
the
respondents
do
not
contend
that
scott
nelson
was
injured
during
the
recruitment
process
in
this
country.
rather,
they
contend
that
the
harm
alleged
here
occurred
10
months
later
during
his
employment
in
saudi
arabia.
the
respondents'
intentional
injury
claims
are
explicitly
based
on
the
saudis'
noncommercial
acts
of
arresting
and
jailing
mr.
nelson
in
that
country.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that
claim
would
be
based
on
the
contract.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
contract
here
had
a
forum
selection
clause
that
provided
that
any
dispute
arising
from
this
contract
shall
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
saudi
courts
only.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
that
case,
the
question
becomes
one
of
substantial
contacts.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
our
answer
would
be
that
the
contract
alone
would
not
be
substantial
contacts.
under
this
court's
reasoning
in
burger
king,
the
mere
entry
into
a
contract
in
the
united
states
is
insufficient
to
establish
minimum
contacts.
we
believe
substantial
contacts
must
be
at
least
that
amount,
and
for
that
reason,
we
don't
believe
that
simply
the
execution
of
the
contract
would
allow
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
at
some
point,
this
becomes
a
question
of
the
extent
of
the
contacts
that
the
saudi
government
might
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
that
case,
i
think
that
it
probably
would
qualify.
we
are
not
far
removed
from
the
weltover
situation
in
that
case.
as
you
recall,
in
weltover,
the
contract
was...
in
that
case,
it
was
a
bond
agreement.
the
bond
agreements
were
actually
issued
in
argentina,
but
the
breach
occurred
in
the
united
states,
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
breach
of
performance
had
direct
effect
in
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
again,
the
question
would
be
substantial
contacts.
if
that
occurred
in
the
united
states,
this
would
be
covered,
of
course,
by
the
tort
exception.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
if
it
occurred
abroad,
the
question
here
would
be
substantial
contacts.
also,
commercial...
if
i
could
step
back--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
misunderstood
your
question,
and
my
answer
there
is
that
would
not
be
a
commercial
activity
in
that
situation,
that
is
a
tort
that
occurs
overseas.
now,
in
this
case
the
alleged
recruitment
activities
in
this
country
simply
have
no
legal
or
factual
bearing
on
respondents'
right
to
relief
and
we
think
that's
critical
to
the
inquiry
in
this
situation.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
specific
language
of
the
commercial
activity
exception,
and
perhaps
for
that
reason,
respondents
have
changed
their
legal
theory.
the
centerpiece
of
respondents'
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
was,
quote,
the
detention
and
torture
of
mr.
nelson
were
based
upon
his
recruitment
in
the
united
states.
this
is
the
heading
on
page
11
of
their
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
now
purport
to
base
their
claims
on
the
saudis'
operation
of
the
entire
hospital
enterprise.
the
respondents'
new
theory,
which
we
do
not
believe
was
argued
below,
also
fails
to
satisfy
the
based
upon
requirement.
as
this
court
indicated
in
weltover,
the
focus
must
be
on
the
particular
commercial
conduct,
transaction,
or
act
that
provides
the
basis
for
the
claim.
the
respondents'
complaint
does
not
seek
damages
because
the
saudis
operate
a
hospital,
nor
does
it
seek
to
enjoin
any
hospital
policy
with
respect
to
employees
or
employee
discipline.
the
request
for
relief
here
is
explicitly
based
on
allegations
that
saudi
officials
committed
certain
specific
acts
of
battery,
wrongful
arrest,
and
imprisonment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
negligence
claims
may
stand
on
a
somewhat
different
footing.
the
negligence
claims
here
are
rather
opaque,
but
they
might
be
read
to
allege
the
saudi
arabian
government,
when
recruiting
in
the
united
states,
violated
some
recognized
duty
that
is
generally
applicable
to
all
recruiters
in
the
united
states.
and
we
would
agree
that
if
saudi
arabia
conducts
recruitment
activities
in
the
united
states,
it
is
subject
to
the
same
rules,
the
same
federal
and
state
law
based
obligations,
that
govern
the
nonsovereign
recruiters.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'm
sure
you'd
not
be
able
to,
and
i
think
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
might
not
be
different.
i
think
much
depends
on
what
specifically
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
this
complaint...
it
appears
that
all
the
respondents
are
saying
is
that
the
assailant
here
had
a
duty
to
warn
before
they
struck
us.
in
that
case,
if
that
is
what
the
complaint
says,
then
that
puts
this
case
on
all
fours
with
shearer.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
duty
to
warn...
it's
not
clear,
first
of
all,
whether
there
is
any
such
duty
to
warn.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
that's
what
the
complaint
seems
to
say
in
this
case
now,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
would
think
not,
but
again--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
respondents
should
have
an
opportunity
to
make
that
argument,
we
believe.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
ultimately
our
position
here
is
based
not
on
the
merits
of
this
individual
claim,
but
rather,
we're
concerned
with
the
broader
principle,
and
that
is
the
question
of
what
we
mean
by
based
upon
a
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states.
the
difficulty
here
is
the
result
might
seem
harsh
in
this
individual
case,
but
it
accords
with
the
reasonable
and
reciprocal
expectations
of
sovereign
nations
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
their
police
powers
within
their
own
borders.
for
example,
the
united
states
would
vigorously
object
to
being
sued
in
a
saudi
court
by
a
saudi
citizen
seeking
damages
based
on
his
arrest
in
this
country
regardless
of
the
reason
for
his
arrest
or
his
treatment
while
in
jail.
sovereign
nations
have
always
been
immune
from
these
types
of
lawsuits,
and
nothing
in
the
commercial
activity
exception
alters
that
rule.
our
view
is,
in
this
case,
that
even
if
you
could
characterize
the
arresting
and
jailing
of
mr.
nelson
as
commercial
practices,
those
practices
do
not
have
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states
in
any
event.
not
only
do
the
alleged
saudi
practices
regulate
employee
conduct
taking
place
wholly
in
a
saudi-owned
work
place
in
saudi
arabia,
but
mr.
nelson's
employment
contract
specifically
stated...
and
as
i
alluded
to
before,
and
i
quote
now...
in
the
case
of
any
dispute
arising
from
this
contract,
the
saudi
courts,
authorities,
or
commissions
only
will
have
jurisdiction.
thus,
the
contract
that
mr.
nelson
signed
clearly
envisioned
that
any...
that
u.s.
courts
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
any
dispute
arising
from
his
employment
relationship.
and
this
dispute
here,
even
if
couched
in
tort
terms,
is
really
no
different.
unless
there
are
further
questions--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
weltover
indicates
that
we
should
look
to
the
commercial
activities
as
congress
understood
them
at
the
time
it
enacted
the
fsia.
there
is
a
statement
in
weltover
that
suggests
that
that
is...
that
congress
relied
heavily
on
the
meaning
of
commercial
activity
when
it
adopted
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
in
1976.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
what
congress
would
have
envisioned
at
that
time.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
