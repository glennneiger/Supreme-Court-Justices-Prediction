under
that
analysis,
it
seems
to
me
you
make
irrelevant
the
injunction
of
the
statute
that
purpose
shall
not
be
considered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
of
the
security
guards
beating
up
the
employee,
they
did
it
in
order
to
punish
the
employee
for
transgressions
on
the
job
and
to
teach
other
employees
not
to
do
that
in
the
future.
is
that
not
a
commercial
activity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me
the
extent
to
which
you
base
your
complaint
on
a
breach
of
the
contract
itself.
we've
been
talking
about
tort.
the
contract
provides
certain
remedies,
certain
provisions
for
discipline
of
the
employee,
one
of
which
is
not
beating.
it's
just
warning,
suspension
without
pay,
et
cetera.
did
you
frame
a
cause
of
action
based
around
a
breach
of
that
provision
of
the
contract?
or
do
you
have
any
contract
breaches
in
your
complaint
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
at
least
use
the
contract
or
may
you
use
the
contract
as
setting
forth
the
duties
of
the
employer,
which
then
gives
rise
to
a
tort
cause
of
action?
is
that
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
your
theory
is
that
by
setting
forth
terms
of
discipline
in
the
contract,
that
at
least
establishes
that
discipline
was
within
the
realm
of
commercial
activity
and
that
the
employer
exceeded
permissible
discipline
and
committed
a
tort
in
this
instance.
is
that--
