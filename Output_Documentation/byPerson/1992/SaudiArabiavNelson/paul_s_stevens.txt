mr.
paul
s.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
jurisdiction
over
a
hospital,
not
a
police
department.
the
question
presented
is
this.
may
a
hospital
owned
by
a
foreign
government
come
to
the
united
states
for
its
work
force,
recruit
and
hire
a
united
states
citizen
to
perform
a
specific
job
overseas,
beat
and
torture
him
for
the
proper
performance
of
his
responsibilities,
and
then
claim
immunity
for
its
actions
in
the
u.s.
courts?
we
say
it
cannot.
our
argument
deals
with
the
hospital.
it
consists
of
two
main
points.
first,
there
are,
as
the
court
knows,
three
separate
defendants
in
this
case,
and
there
are,
in
effect,
three
separate
complaints.
where
this
hospital
is
concerned,
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
the
facial
challenge
that
they
have
mounted
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
requires
that
a
court
focus
on
the
factual
allegations
in
the
complaint
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
hospital.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
yes,
it
was.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
eight
causes
of
action
stated
against
saudi
arabia.
the
united
states,
as
amicus,
has
said
that
at
least
one
of
those,
the
negligence
count,
should
survive
the
jurisdictional
test.
we
believe
that
saudi
arabia
can
be
answerable
as
an
alter
ego
of
the
hospital,
as
its
principal,
as
the
person
exercising
control
over
all
aspects
of
its
operations.
but
there
are,
in
the
complaint
in
counts
iii
through
vii,
alternative
theories
of
liability
that
are
stated
against
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia,
international
law
theories
that,
frankly
in
our
view,
cannot
withstand
analysis
following
the
court's
decision
in
the
amerada
hess
case.
this
complaint
was
filed
prior
to
that
decision.
what
we
are
advancing
in
this
argument
today
is
the
core
proposition
of
jurisdiction
over
the
hospital
and
the
subsidiary
proposition
that
there
is
jurisdiction
over
saudi
arabia
as
its
owner
and
royspec
as
its
agent
in
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
in
its
capacity
as
the
owner
and
operator
of
a
hospital
enterprise,
that
is
correct.
but
the
core
proposition,
the
core
issue--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--first,
your
honor,
we
do
believe
it's
unquestionable
that
the
principal
will
be
answerable
for
the
acts
of
its
agent
and
that
there
will
be
jurisdiction
extended
for
those
acts
even
if
they're
not
performed
directly
in
the
united
states.
on
this
basis,
the
hospital
and
saudi
arabia
as
its
owner
are
answerable
for
jurisdictional
purposes
at
least
for
the
actions
of
the
hospital
corporation
of
america,
and
if
hca
had
done
something
beyond
the
scope
of
its
authority
as
an
agent
that
was
wrongful,
you
would
apply
simple
agency
analysis
for
purposes
of
liability,
but
the
jurisdictional
question
would
remain
to
be
applied
and
addressed
under
the
statute.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
justice
scalia,
our
view
is
that
there
is
a
very
short
menu
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
provides.
things
are
either
commercial
or
they
are
sovereign.
there
is
not
a
third,
private
type
of
action
which
falls
somewhere
between
the
two.
insofar
as
the
hospital
is
concerned,
the
activity
that
you
described
would
be
commercial
for
jurisdictional
purposes
under
the
statute.
now--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--it
may
be
an
odd
sense
of
the
term
commercial.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
but
it
certainly
could
not
be
considered
governmental
or
sovereign
or
uniquely
public
in
nature.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
the
torts
that
we
have
alleged
in
the
complaint
against
the
hospital...
and
this
is
the
key
point--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--for
purposes
of
a
jurisdictional
analysis
under
the
statute,
it
cannot
be
uniquely
governmental.
therefore,
it
would
be
commercial.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the
question
under
the
act
in
our
view
is
the
outward
form
of
the
conduct.
would
the
hospital
in
that
instance
be
operating
in
some
uniquely
governmental
capacity
as
the
regulator
of--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--that
is
our
position.
the
statute
in
our
view
subjects
the
hospital
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
based
upon
its
conduct,
commercial
conduct,
whether
performed
here
or
abroad
so
long
as
that
conduct
has
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the
complaint
alleges,
in
a
portion
titled,
factual
allegations
against
king
faisal
specialist
hospital,
a
course
of
dealing
in
the
united
states
that
goes
well
beyond
the
specific
advertisement
that
was
issued
in
the
u.s.
media
or
the
specific
recruitment
of
scott
nelson.
but
the
most
fundamental
conduct
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
petitioners
came
to
the
united
states
to
ask
mr.
nelson
to
do
a
specific
job
for
them,
induced
him
through
a
rather
extensive
course
of
dealing
to
come
to
saudi
arabia
to
do
that
job,
and
once
he
was
there,
beat
and
tortured
him
precisely
for
doing
that
job
that
they
had
recruited
and
hired
him
to
do.
now,
when
mr.
nelson
and
the
hospital
entered
into
an
agreement
here
in
the
united
states,
there
were
some
specific
aspects
of
that
agreement
that
bear
upon
the
substantial
contact
requirement.
first
of
all,
the
agreement
identified
mr.
nelson
as
an
expatriate
employee
of
the
hospital.
it
identified
fort
lauderdale,
florida
as
his
u.s.
point
of
origin
and
the
point
to
which
he
would
be
returned.
it
required
him
to
surrender
his
united
states
passport
to
the
hospital,
but
it
also
obligated
the
hospital
to
return
him
to
the
united
states
following
the
termination
of
his
services.
in
other
words,
this
hospital
said,
mr.
nelson,
if
you
quit,
if
you
perform
poorly,
or
if
you
break
the
rules
of
the
hospital,
we
will
send
you
home.
now,
our
view
is
that
when
the
hospital
entered
into
that
agreement
and
mutual
understanding
with
mr.
nelson,
it
assumed
an
obligation
to
exercise
care
and
diligence
as
an
employer
for
mr.
nelson's
safe
passage
during
his--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--precisely,
we
would.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
but
the
point,
justice
white,
is
the
united
states
contacts
bracket
this
entire
employment
relationship.
it's
not
simply
that
they
came
here.
it's
that
they
said
he
would
be
sent
back,
and
they
assumed
a
duty
during
the
time
that
he
was
gone
to
exercise
due
care
and
diligence.
now
if--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--i
was
addressing
my
remarks,
justice
scalia,
to
the
substantial
contact
requirement.
the
statute
does
not
say--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
our
point
is
that
the
duty
that
the
hospital
assumed
was
one
that
extended
from
the
time
it
was...
first
employed
mr.
nelson
here
in
the
united
states,
through
his
tour
of
duty
there,
until
he
was
returned
to
this
country,
and
that
this,
as
an
obligation
reflected
directly
in
their
employment
contract,
gives
the
court
a
sense
of
the
substantial
contacts
that
the
duty
and
the
activities
of
the
hospital
vis-a-vis
mr.
nelson
had
with
this
country.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice,
this
was
mr.
nelson's
employer.
it
is
commonplace
in
our
law
that
an
employer
assumes
a
duty
to
prevent
injury
to
his
employee,
a
duty
of
diligence
and
care,
ordinary
care
at
least,
for
the
well-being
of
the
employee.
now,
if
there
is
such
a
duty
in
our
law--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
prevent
foreseeable
injury
at
the
hands
of
anyone,
to
the
extent
that
the
employer
can
exercise
ordinary
care
for
that
purpose.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
if
your
employer
knows
that
there
is
a
dangerous
criminal
lurking
outside
the
entranceway,
it
may
issue
some
kind
of
warning
that
you
should
take
care.
but
more
fundamentally,
we're
not
talking
about
the
negligence
question,
because
if
there
is
such
a
duty,
however
it
may
be
defined,
then
certainly
there's
an
obligation
on
an
employer
not
to
cause
injury.
but
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
say
that's
precisely
what
this
hospital
did.
it
intentionally
caused
mr.
nelson
grievous
injury,
false
imprisonment,
and
battery.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
you're
correct
that
it
does
not
depend,
in
the
way
that
we
think
about
these
things,
on
the
articulation
of
a
duty,
but
in
our
view,
both
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
commercial
activity
and
its
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states,
you
cannot
look
at
these
torts,
these
intentional
torts,
in
isolation
and
rip
them
out
of
this
commercial
context.
these
were,
after
all,
actions
taken
by
the
hospital
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
the
truth
of
the
allegations
which
petitioners
admit,
by
the
hospital
as
an
employer
against
its
employee
precisely
for
the
performance
of
his
job
responsibilities.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
justice
souter,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
here,
why
it
may
be
that
this
employer
beat
mr.
nelson,
that
purpose
is
reflected
in
the
complaint,
but
that
an
employer
intentionally
injures
an
employee
in
whatever
association
it
may
be,
on
the
work
place,
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
his
jobs,
however
that
happens,
is
an
action
that
any
private
hospital
employer
could
have
done.
and
it's
not
made
less
commercial
just
because
it
is
so
horrendous.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
it
is
a
commercial
activity.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
the
statute
talks
about
commercial
activities.
it
talks
about
a
course
of
conduct--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--or
a
particular
transaction
or
an
act.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
justice
souter,
it's
not
a
question
about
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
you
would
not
have
a
cause
of
action,
but
you
might
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the
proposition
is
narrow
and
simple,
and
it
is
that
torts
committed
by
an
employer
in
the
context
of
an
employment
relationship
are
commercial,
just
as
they
would
be
if
the
employer
breached
a
contract.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
that...
we
know
more
in
this
case,
but
that
is
all
that
you
would
need
to
know
for
our
jurisdiction
analysis.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
correct.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
justice
scalia,
there
may
not
be
a
cause
of
action.
it
may
be
that
the
complaint
could
be
dismissed.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
we
would
say
that
it
provides
the
jurisdictional
basis
under
the
statute,
yes,
that
it's
a
commercial
activity.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
torts...
as
the
employer
against
the
employee,
it
would
be
a
commercial
activity
in
our
view.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
the
issue
of
substantial
contact
is
one,
justice
white,
that
is
not
subject
to
the
limitations
as
to
nature
and
purpose
that
the
analysis
of
whether
an
act
is
commercial
in
nature
is
subject
to.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
our
theory
is
that
the
action
is
based
upon
commercial
conduct,
transactions
or
acts
that
have
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states,
and
nothing
more
is
required
in
the
statute
by
the
express
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the
conduct
upon
which
this
case
is
based
performed
by
this
hospital--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--is
commercial
and
has
such
substantial
contact.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
there
was
an
unbroken
course
of
dealing
with
respect
to
mr.
nelson.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
to
the
activity.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the
recruitment,
the
signing
of
the
contract,
the
definition
of
the
job
responsibilities,
and
all
of
those
activities
that
occurred
here
in
the
united
states
that
led
to
mr.
nelson's
accepting
his
employment
and
performing
those
responsibilities
in
saudi
arabia.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
he
was
interviewed
in
saudi
arabia,
justice
white.
petitioners
have
given
the
court
three
different
versions
of
this.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
i'm
certain
that
he
did,
but
they
were
finely
defined
in
the
employment
agreement,
in
the
job
description,
and
in
the
advertisement
that
was...
that
he
first
responded
to.
on
the
specific
point
of
what
happened
in
saudi
arabia,
petitioners
have
given
in
three
different
submissions
three
different
versions.
on
page
3
of
their
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
they
say
that
mr.
nelson
was
interviewed
in
saudi
arabia,
and
then
he
was
offered
and
accepted
the
job
in
the
united
states.
in
their
brief
on
the
merits
at
page
3,
they
say
he
was
interviewed
for
and
offered
the
job
in
saudi
arabia,
and
then
came
back
to
the
united
states
and
accepted.
finally,
on
page
18
of
their
reply
brief,
they
say
he
was
interviewed
for,
offered
the
job,
and
accepted
it
in
saudi
arabia.
the
fact
is
the
court
must
accept
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
against
the
hospital
as
true.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
true,
and
what
does
the
complaint
say.
that's
the
key
issue
here,
taking
them
as
true.
first,
it
says
that
the
hospital
conducted
a
regular
part
of
its
business
activities
in
the
united
states,
and
this
consisted
of
advertising
for,
recruiting,
employing,
orienting,
and
training
its
employees.
secondly,
that
in
november
1983,
the
hospital
published
an
ad
for
a
specific
hospital
job.
thereafter
it
recruited
mr.
nelson
to
take
the
job.
it
entered
into
an
employment
agreement
with
him
concerning
the
job,
and
it
arranged
for
his
transportation
to
saudi
arabia
to
begin
work,
all
here
in
the
united
states.
it
further
alleges
that
mr.
nelson
was
required
by
that
job
to
monitor
the
physical
plant
of
the
hospital
to
ensure
the
safety
of
patients
and
staff.
it
further
states
that
in
march
of
1984,
mr.
nelson
discovered
safety
problems
at
the
hospital.
he
reported
them
to
hospital
officials,
as
his
job
required
him
to
do.
he
subsequently
reported
them
to
a
saudi
arabian
investigating
commission
that
was
investigating
the
hospital.
and
finally,
that
the
hospital,
as
a
direct
result
of
his
reporting
these
safety
problems,
had
him
beaten
and
tortured
by
persons
acting
at
its
direction
and
subject
to
its
control.
as
a
result,
mr.
nelson
is
permanently
disabled.
these
are
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
are
to
be
accepted
as
true.
these
are
the
allegations
that
define
the
jurisdictional
issue
with
respect
to
both
the
commercial
nature
of
the
activities
and
the
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states.
now,
in
our
view
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
this
particular
employer
chose
to
retaliate
against
its
employee
by
detention
and
torture
rather
than
by
firing
him
and
sending
him
home.
certainly
if
the
hospital
had
breached
the
employment
contract
with
mr.
nelson,
that
act
would
be
commercial,
and
beating
and
torture
can't
be
less
commercial
just
because
they're
so
much
more
extreme.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
i
believe
that
the
court's
decision
in
the
dunhill
case,
which
recently
in
the
weltover
opinion
this
court
has
said
has
authoritative
explanation
of
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
can
be
looked
to
to
establish
what
is
essentially
the
dichotomy
here.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
it
was
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
handed
down
shortly
before
the
act
went
into
law
and
has
been
said
by
this
court
to
be
an
authoritative
gloss
at
least
on
the
purposes
the
act
was
intended
to
serve
and
the
nature
of
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
an
advanced
gloss.
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
precisely.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
we
approach
it
in
much
the
same
way,
and
it
is
a
conundrum
that
this
dichotomy
places
one
in,
a
dilemma,
so
to
speak,
and
i
would
acknowledge
that.
but
our
consideration
is
very
straightforward.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
the
law
has
resolved
that
question,
justice
stevens.
it
could
be
a
form
of
commerce
by
those
people
who
are
engaging
in
it,
i
suppose.
the
point
is
that
this
was
an
action
taken
by
a
hospital,
an
employer,
in
the
context
of
an
employment
relationship,
and
it
really
doesn't
matter
why
the
act
was
taken.
if
you
look
to
the
experience
of
the
u.s.
marketplace,
you
certainly
can
see
all
sorts
of
cases
that
go
off
on
the
issue
of
the
wrongful
discharge
of
an
employee,
retaliatory
actions
taken
against
an
employee
by
an
employer,
whistle
blower
statutes
that
are
now
the
modern
craze,
i
suppose,
to
address
these
kinds
of
wrongs.
nowhere
is
it
suggested
to
me
in
our
jurisprudence
that
just
because
these
acts
were
terrible,
wrongful,
injurious,
tortious,
that
they
are
less
commercial
for
that
reason.
and
consider
the
signal
that
such
a
conclusion
would
send.
if
a
foreign
sovereign
running
a
commercial
enterprise
wishes
to
breach
a
contract,
well,
it
shouldn't
fire
the
employee
and
stand
ready
to
answer
in
damages.
it
should
have
the
employee
done
away
with,
because
then
it
has
removed
any
possibility
that
it
will
have
to
answer
for
its
actions
in
the
u.s.
courts
since
doing
away
with
an
employee
can't
be
a
commercial
act.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
we
have
no
causes
of
action
in
contract.
i
suppose
you
could
say--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--it
is
because
of
the
way
that
counsel
in
the
original
proceeding
wrote
the
complaint,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
be
happy
to--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--well,
our
theory
with
respect
to
the
contract
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
understand
either
the
commercial
nature
of
the
activity
or
the
substantiality
of
the
contact
with
the
united
states
without
looking
to
the
agreement.
implied
by
the
agreement
are
duties
that
were
undertaken
by
the
employer
that
underscore
both
the
liability
on
the
negligence
claim,
but
the
nature
of
the
commercial
contact...
commercial
activity
and
the
contact.
you
could,
i
suppose,
make
a
quasi-contractual
argument
that
an
employer
is
obligated
by
a
contract
not
to
torture
its
employee,
but
you
can
also,
under
our
jurisprudence,
make
an
independent
and
perhaps
more
compelling
tort
claim,
and
that's
what
we
have
done.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
arguing
with
respect
to
that
portion
of
the
contract.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
the--
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
--it
would
be
the
common
law
of
florida
with
respect
to
the
obligations
of
an
employer
or
recruiter
active
in
florida.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
justice
o'connor,
i
cannot,
and
the
theory
of
liability
may
be
one
that
would
break
some
ground
in
the
florida
courts.
mr.
paul
s.
stevens
well,
i
think
the
obligations
of
a
recruiter
or
employer
to
warn
of
job-related
dangers
is
not
a
new
theory.
i
mean,
there
are
risks
inherent
in
employment
which
may
not
be
foreseeable
to
the
employee,
but
which,
if
reasonably
foreseen
by
the
employer,
have
to
be
pointed
out,
and
there
are
certainly
many
cases
that
hold
that.
with
respect
to
the
application
of
this
principle
in
the
context
of
recruitment
and
the
activities
of
a
foreign
government-owned
hospital
and
its
employment
practices
or
a
foreign
police
operation
and
its
peculiar
practices,
it
would
break
new
ground
insofar
as
that
is
concerned.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
conclude
my
argument.
