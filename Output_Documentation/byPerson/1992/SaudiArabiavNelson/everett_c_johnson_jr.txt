mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
united
states
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
review
respondent's
allegations
that
while
working
for
a
government-owned
hospital
in
saudi
arabia,
he
was
wrongfully
arrested,
imprisoned
and
tortured
by
agents
of
the
government
of
saudi
arabia.
the
answer
to
this
question
must
be
no.
nevertheless,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
clause
1
in
the
commercial
activity
exception
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
conferred
jurisdiction
over
respondent's
claims.
in
so
holding,
the
court
of
appeals
made
two
distinct
findings:
first,
that
each
and
every
cause
of
action
in
the
complaint
was
based
upon
commercial
activity;
and
second,
that
that
commercial
activity
had
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
on
both
grounds.
nevertheless,
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
either
ground
requires
dismissal
of
the
complaint
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
cause
of
action
is
based
upon
commercial
activity
when
the
acts
complained
of
bear
a
jurisdictional
nexus
to
that
activity.
that
is
to
say,
the
acts
complained
of
themselves
need
not
be
commercial.
they
must
simply
exist
in
some
poorly
defined
proximity
to
some
other
activity
of
the
foreign
sovereign
state
which
is
commercial.
in
so--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
recruitment
activity
in
this
country
by
the
client,
if
the
acts
of
its
agent,
hca,
are
to
be
attributed
to
it,
would
be
commercial
activity.
we
think
it
lacks--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--recruiting
and
hiring
in
this
case
is
a
commercial
activity
i
believe,
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
suggests
that
certain
kinds
of
hiring
may
not
be
commercial
activity.
however,
in
this
case,
we
believe...
and
i
believe
the
district
court
found--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--no,
i
think
it's
not
that,
justice
white.
there
is
a
question,
which
the
court
would
need
to
reach
if
it
were
to
find
that,
in
the
abstract,
the
activity
in
the
united
states
could
reach
the
legal
standard
of
substantial
contact,
whether
or
not
the
acts
of
hca,
which
was
the
cayman
corporation
which
actually
did
the
recruiting
in
the
united
states,
could
be
automatically
attributed
to
saudi
arabia.
the
district
court
expressly
reserved
that
question
because
it
found
that
the
contacts,
even
if
attributed
to
saudi
arabia--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--i
believe
they
should
not
be
automatically
attributed,
your
honor.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
i
believe
they
should
not
be
attributed
in
this
case,
and
let
me
elaborate
on
that
if
i
may.
hca,
to
be
sure,
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
government
of
saudi
arabia
to
recruit
expatriate
personnel
from
the
united
states
and
around
the
world.
however,
the
decisions
with
respect
to
the
recruiting
and
the
obligations
to
comply
with
u.s.
law
and
all
other
laws
were
expressly
reserved
to
hca.
we
think
this
is
the
kind
of
circumstance
where
not
only
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
should
the
acts
of
the
agent
not--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
believe
the--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--the
contract
of
employment
mr.
nelson
alleges
was
signed
in
florida,
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
was
signed--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--it
was
signed
on
behalf
of
the
hospital
by
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
donald
lafeu
who
was
an
employee
of
hca.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
they
did,
your
honor.
the
eleventh
circuit's
construction
of
the
based
upon
language
is
critical
to
this
court's
determination.
we
think
the
eleventh
circuit's
construction
is
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
ignores
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
second,
it
obliterates
the
restrictive
theory
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
which
the
statute
was
intended
to
codify.
in
its
common
sense
and
most
straightforward
meaning,
based
upon
refers
to
the
gravamen
or
the
foundation
of
the
complaint.
thus,
in
the
most
common
sense
interpretation,
the
bases
of
a
complaint
are
the
acts
complained
of.
it
does
not
naturally
or
inherently
inquire
of
a
nexus
or
connection
to
other
activity.
the
eleventh
circuit's
construction
in
this
case,
nevertheless,
imports
the
nexus
or
connection
inquiry
into
the
based
upon
language.
we
think
this
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
most
common
sense
and
straightforward,
in
fact,
simple
meaning
of
the
phrase
based
upon.
to
illustrate--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--justice
stevens,
if
i
may
break
that
into
two
parts.
assuming,
of
course,
that
the
breach
of
contact...
contract
was
not
based
upon
the
same
conduct
in
question
here,
it
could
be.
nevertheless,
saudi
arabia
would
still--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--that
could
be
based
upon
commercial
activity,
yes,
justice
stevens.
in
this
case,
there
still
wouldn't
be
sufficient
contact
with
the
united
states,
the
second
part
of
the
inquiry,
to
justify
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
that
breach.
we
would
not--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--yes.
not
so
much
impact,
because
everyone
concedes
in
this
case
it's
a
clause
1
case,
which
refers
to
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
the
united
states
has
taken
a
formal
position
on
the
substantial
contact
inquiry
in
this
case
because
it
is,
properly
understood,
a
much
more
fact-specific
inquiry.
i
don't
think
they
disagree
with
us,
but
i'm
not
sure
they
have
taken
a
formal
position.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
well,
i
think--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--i...
well,
it
depends
on
the
underlying
facts.
if
we
import
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
that
is,
take
the
same
level
of
activity
in
the
united
states
which
respondent
refers
to
as
his
recruitment
in
the
united
states
and
the
signing
of
the
employment
contract
in
the
united
states,
yes,
sir,
that
would
not
be
enough
contact
with
the
united
states
in
this
case
to
justify
jurisdiction.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
well,
of
course,
the
in
the
united
states
is
the
question.
the
statute
itself
defines
carried
on
in
the
united
states
to
mean
having
contact
with
the...
having
substantial
contact
with
the
united
states.
and
if
substantial
contact
is
to
be
given
its
plain
meaning,
that
must
mean
more
than
trivial
or
minimum
contact.
so,
in
our
view
the
contact
in
the
united
states
has
to
be
more
than
transitory
or
a
precursor
contact
to
the
commercial
activity.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
that
may
be
cutting
too
fine
a
point,
justice
scalia.
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
recruitment
in
the
united
states
and
the
performance
of
the
contract
in
saudi
arabia
are
divisible.
i'm
not
sure
i
would
draw
the
line,
as
you've
suggested,
between
the
signing
of
the
contract
and
the
performance
of
the
contract.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
well,
i...
and
i
think
these
questions
come
together
somewhat
in
this
inquiry
because
the
question
is
what
is
the
cause
of
action
based
upon,
and
to
be
sure,
the
cause
of
action
does
not
refer
back
to
the
recruitment
activity.
it
refers
about...
to
alleged
injuries...
pardon
me...
occurring
entirely
in
saudi
arabia.
so,
i
think
the
recruitment
activity
in
the
united
states
is
insufficient.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
question,
of
course,
has
the
same
two
components.
and
assuming
for
a
moment
out
of
the
question
whether
or
not
that
cause
of
action
is
based
upon
commercial
activity,
obviously,
we
contend
that
it
is
not.
even
if
the
court
were
to--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--well,
because,
justice
scalia,
it's
just
a
different
theory
of
recovery
for
the
same
conduct,
and
the
statute
is
explicit
in
at
least
this
one
thing.
it
directs
the
court
to
inquire
of
the
nature
of
the
conduct
in
question.
the
duty
to
warn
cause
of
action,
to
be
sure,
adds
another
legal
element
and
spins
the
theory
of
recovery
somewhat
differently.
the
conduct
that
he
complains
about
is,
nevertheless,
exactly
the
same,
and
that's
his
allegations
regarding
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
in
saudi
arabia.
and
we
think
the
dispositive
question
for
the
based
upon
inquiry
is
not
what
is
the
plaintiff's
theory
of
recovery
or
how
clever
has
the
drafter
of
the
complaint
been,
but
rather,
what
is
the
core
conduct
in
question,
in
this
case
it
being
inherently
sovereign
conduct,
arrest,
and
imprisonment,
and
allegations
regarding
torture.
that...
there's
no
construction
of
commercial
activity
that
reaches
that--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--and
saudi
arabia,
not
qatar,
is
the
defendant
in
the
lawsuit.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
yes,
that
would
not
be
commercial
activity,
as
we
understand
it,
your
honor,
because
the
underlying
conduct
about
which
they
complain,
albeit
couched
as
a
negligence
cause
of
action...
every
injury
has
attendant
to
it
a
theoretical
failure
of
a
duty
to
warn
if
you
can
find
a
legal
relationship
with
someone.
we
think,
therefore,
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
underlying
core
conduct,
in
your
hypothetical
injury
in
qatar.
it's
not
different
than
the
injury
in
saudi
arabia
and
not
commercial.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
may
just
disagree
with
you
slightly
about
where
the
recruiting
activity
occurred
in
this
case.
respondents
contend
that
it
occurs
in
saudi
arabia,
but
if
we
strip
that
allegation
from
its
legal
conclusion
recruitment,
we
see
that
it,
in
fact,
occurred
almost
entire...
rather,
they
contend
it
occurred
in
florida,
and
it
in
fact
occurred
on
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case
almost
entirely
in
saudi
arabia.
in
fact,
it's
undisputed
here
that
he
interviewed
for
the
job
in
saudi
arabia,
that
he
was
offered
the
job
in
saudi
arabia,
implicitly
he
accepted
the
job
in
saudi
arabia.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
we
do
not
contest,
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
his
allegation
that
he
saw
a
newspaper
advertisement
while
in
the
united
states.
that's
the
entirety
of
the
recruitment
in
the
united
states
that
he
bases
his
allegation
upon.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
yes.
coming
back
to
justice
white's
earlier
question,
i
don't
concede
that
that
conduct
is
attributable
to
saudi
arabia
for
purposes
of
the
substantial
contact
question,
but
yes,
the
recruitment
itself
in
the
united
states
is
most
likely
commercial
activity.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
your
honor.
as
you
say
and
as
the
united
states
aptly
pointed
out
in
this
brief,
the
allegation
of
respondent
here
is
nothing
more
than
the
allegation
that
an
assailant
has
a
duty
to
warn
before
he
attacks.
in
that
sense,
the
duty
to
warn
and
the
assailant
in
that
hypothetical
are
the
same.
in
this
case--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--the
court
doesn't
need
to
go
farther
than
that
in
this
case.
that's
right.
perhaps
as
illuminating
as
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
circuit's
construction
is
the
restrictive
theory
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
which
the
statute
was
intended
to
codify,
as
this
court
held
most
recently
in
its
decision
in
weltover
last
year.
the
restrictive...
the
primary
characteristic,
indeed,
the
only
distinguishing
characteristic,
of
the
restrictive
theory
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
is
that
it
purports
to
distinguish
between
the
kind
of
conduct
which
u.s.
courts
may
adjudicate,
commercial
conduct
or
the
public...
or
private
or
commercial
acts
of
a
foreign
sovereign,
and
that
conduct
which
u.s.
courts
can
never
review,
the
inherently
sovereign
or
public
acts
of
a
foreign
sovereign.
and
the
trouble
we
have
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
jurisdictional
nexus
test
in
this
case
is
that
it
not
only
steps
over
that
line,
it
erases
that
line
because
under
the
eleventh
circuit's
construction,
there
is
no
activity
of
any
type
which
a
u.s.
court
could
not
adjudicate
so
long
as
the
plaintiff
were
willing
to
allege
a
sufficient
connection
with
commercial
activity.
it
is,
therefore,
a
completely
limitless
construction
of
the
based
upon
language
which
erases
congress'
primary
purpose
in
codifying
the
restrictive
theory
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
to
distinguish
between
the
types
of
conduct
which
can
be
adjudicated
and
the
types
of
conduct
which
cannot.
i've
struggled
to
find
a
hypothetical
that
was
more
indicative
of
the
danger
of
that
construction
than
the
facts
of
this
case.
candidly,
there's
hard
to
find...
it's
hard
to
find
one.
in
this
case,
the
allegations
go
to
the
very
core,
the
very
quintessential
activity
of
a
government,
the
right
to
exercise
its
police
power,
the
right
to
arrest
and
to
imprison,
to
decide
when
and
under
what
circumstances
a
defendant
shall
be
informed
of
the
charges
against
him,
to
decide
when
and
under
what
circumstances
he
shall
be
provided
with
a
translator,
to
conduct
the
trial,
and
to
generally
govern
the
police
power
within
its
own
territory.
nevertheless,
if
the
eleventh
circuit--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--it
would
not
be
a
different
case.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
makes
it
an
easier
case
i
believe,
but
in
your
hypothetical,
it
would
not
be
a
different
case.
the
agency
or
instrumentality,
in
this
case
the
hospital,
is
defined
as
a
foreign
sovereign
state
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
congress
passed--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--i
do
not.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
it
might
be
a
commercially
motivated
activity,
justice
scalia.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
the
nature
of
it
is
not
commercial.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
it
has
to
be
commercial
to
be
jurisdictional
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
just
the
opposite.
i
think
that
in
my
response
to
justice
scalia
i
was
suggesting
that
the
only
difference
that
he's...
the
only
relationship
to
commercial
activity
that
the
question
suggests
when
the
hypothetical
deals
with
a
private
actor,
as
opposed
to
a
governmental
actor,
is
that
it
implies
a
commercial
purpose.
and
we
agree
fully
that
the
purpose
of
the
activity,
whether
sovereign
or
commercial,
is
utterly
irrelevant.
we
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
activity
itself.
even
if
the
sovereign
state
acted
with
a
commercial
purpose,
which
of
course
saudi
arabia
denies
in
this
case,
but
even
if
that
were
to
be
true,
the
activity
would
become
no
more
inherently
commercial
in
its
nature.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
your
hypothetical
aptly
defines
their
motivation,
their
purpose,
but
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
weltover
is
that
that's
irrelevant,
and
we
look
at
the
nature
of
the
conduct
itself,
not
what
motivates
the
conduct
to
determine
whether
the
activity
is
commercial.
to
be
sure,
that's
a
difficult
inquiry.
i
think
the
court
recognized
that
in
weltover.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
that
is
our
view.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
the
lower
courts
who
have
addressed
that
in
the
opec
cases,
your
honor,
have
tended
to
treat
that
either
alternatively
as
an
act
of
state
in
advance
of
the
jurisdictional
grounds
or
to
treat
it
as
international
agreements
regarding
the
exploitation
of
natural
resources.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
in
my
view,
if
it's
a
conspiracy
between
nations,
it
is
not
a
commercial
activity,
justice
scalia.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
well,
by
a
private
party,
it
would
be
in
violation
of...
a
commercial
activity
and
the
character
of
the
conduct--
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
in
my
view
that
would
not
be
a
commercial
activity.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
it
lies
entirely
in
the
nature
of
the
conduct,
yes,
justice
scalia.
two
very
brief
points,
your
honor.
first,
mr.
stevens
says
that
this
is
an
action
against
the
hospital.
if
it
is,
it
doesn't
help
them.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
has
expressly
made
this
hospital
and
all
other
agencies
and
instrumentalities
of
foreign
sovereigns...
foreign
sovereign
states
for
purposes
of
the
act.
they
are
presumptively
immune.
they
are
only
amenable
to
jurisdiction
of
u.s.
courts
when
they
engage
in
commercial
activity.
their
conduct,
which
is
not
commercial,
is
nevertheless
immune.
respondent
seeks
somewhat
to
have
this
both
ways
by
alleging
that
this
is
an
action
against
the
hospital,
which
they
allege
is
an
inherently
commercial
enterprise,
but
that
the
hospital
is
the
alter
ego
of
saudi
arabia
and
therefore
is,
in
essence,
the
government
of
saudi
arabia.
why
it's
irrelevant
to
our
purpose
is
because
the
hospital
enjoys
its
own
immunity.
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
this
position.
mr.
everett
c.
johnson,
jr.
i
think
it
is
not
a
commercial
activity
qua
the
operation
of
the
hospital,
justice
white.
it
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
what
this
hospital
does
in
saudi
arabia,
and
it's
our
view
that
the
hospital
had
no
contact
at
all
with
the
united
states.
the
only
contact
is
through
its
american
agent.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
