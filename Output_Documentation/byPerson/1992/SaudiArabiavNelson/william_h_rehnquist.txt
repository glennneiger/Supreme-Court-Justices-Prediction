chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-522,
saudi
arabia,
king
faisal
specialist
hospital
and
royspec
v.
scott
nelson.
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
duty
to
warn
arises
out
of
different
circumstances,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it's
much
more
logical
to
say
that
there's
a
duty
to
warn
at
the
time
of
recruitment
activity,
which
is
in
florida,
and
tie
that
to
the
commercial
activity
of
recruiting.
it
seems
to
me
that
comes
over
more
plausibly
than
to
say
the
activities...
or
the
injuries
that
the
fellow
suffered
in
saudi
arabia
arose
out
of
commercial
activity
in
the
united
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was...
don't
you
admit
there
was
any
commercial
activity
amounting
to
recruitment
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
also
concede
that
that
is
commercial
activity
carried
on
in
the
united
states,
the
placing
of
that
newspaper
advertisement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
johnson.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
stevens,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stevens,
you
say
there
are
three
defendants.
saudi
arabia,
the
government,
was
named
also
as
a
defendant
by
you,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
want
it
retained
in
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
do
want
saudi
arabia,
the
state,
retained
as
a
defendant
because
you
contend
it's
the
alter
ego
of
the
hospital.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
when
you
say
you're
just
talking
about
a
hospital,
you're
actually
talking
about
something
more.
you
are
talking
about
a
sovereign
government,
the
government
of
saudi
arabia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't--
--but
you
seem
to
be
making
up
for
what
may
be
a
shortcoming
in
the
jurisdictional
aspects
by
spinning
a
very
elaborate
tort
theory
that
kind
of
subsumes
everything.
i
mean,
that
would
be
an
easy
way
to
get
around
the
limitations
contained
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
to
develop
a
very
elaborate
tort
theory
that
perhaps
would
turn
out
to
be
not
supported
by
the
cases
at
all.
you
say
the
government
of
saudi
arabia
assumed
a
duty
to
kind
of
look
after
him
from
the
time
he
left
this
country
until
the
time
he
was
returned.
well,
i
really
think
you
have
to
stretch
quite
a
bit
to
get
that
out
of
these
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
to
prevent
injury
at
the
hands
of
the
employer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
mean,
when
i
leave
the
premises
of,
say,
the
store
that
i
work
at
and
walk
home
at
night,
my
employer
has
a
duty
to
see
that
nobody
mugs
me
on
the
way
home?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
depend
on
any
duty
of
care.
that's
a
tort
by
virtue
of
an
intentional
assault.
it
doesn't
depend
on
any
rather
elaborate
duty.
but
that
took
place
in
saudi
arabia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stevens,
you
said
earlier
i
think
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
scalia
that
you
thought
the
act
divided
conduct
into
governmental
and
commercial.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
rely
on
any
of
our
decisions
for
that
proposition
or
on
some
specific
part
of
the
statutory
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
dunhill
was
not
an
interpretation
of
the
fsia,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevens.
mr.
johnson,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
mr.
johnson,
while
you're
getting
ready,
it
seems
to
me
shooting
somebody
in
the
head,
i
suggested
to
your
opponent,
is
not
a
commercial
activity.
what
about
fixing
prices,
violating
the
sherman
act?
that's
a
violation
of
law
too.
is
that
a
commercial
activity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stevens.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-522,
saudi
arabia
versus
nelson
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
