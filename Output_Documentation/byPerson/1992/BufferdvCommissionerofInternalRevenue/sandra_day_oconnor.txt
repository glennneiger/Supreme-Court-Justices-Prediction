mr.
jones,
would
you
clarify
for
me
what
the
rule
would
be
with
respect
to
a
so-called
subchapter
c,
or
an
ordinary
corporation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
disagree
with
the
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute
and
his
description
of
what
the
rule
would
be
for
a
different
type
of
corporation.
