mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
section
6501,
the
service
has
3
years
from
the
filing
of
any
return
to
make
an
assessment
of
the
taxes
imposed
on
that
return.
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
you
need
to
know
what
an
assessment
is.
an
assessment
is
merely
an
administrative
record
filed
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
based
upon
the
service's
review
or
audit
of
the
taxpayer's
taxable
income,
the
assessment
records,
as
this
statute
states,
the
amount
of
taxes
imposed
on
that
income.
nothing
in
section
6501
suggests
that
by
limiting
the
time
for
recording
an
assessment,
the
statute
in
any
manner
limits
the
amount
of
taxes
imposed
on
the
taxable
income
of
the
taxpayer
by
the
other
provisions
of
the
code.
i'd
like
to
give
you
an
example.
assume
that
a
corporation
files
a
return
claiming
a
deduction
of
$10,000
for
compensation
that
it
paid
to
a
certain
employee.
if
the
corporate
return
is
in
error
and
the
employee
actually
received
$50,000
of
compensation,
nothing
in
section
6501
would
prohibit
the
service
from
making
an
adjustment
to
the
taxpayer's
return
to
include
that
$50,000
as
his
taxable
income.
this
compensation
is
taxable
income
under
the
code
and
a
tax
is
imposed
on
that
income
under
the
code
even
if
the
corporate
return
failed
accurately
to
report
it.
as
the
courts
held
in
the
green,
fehlhaber,
bufford,
durovic,
and
leonhart
cases,
the
fact
that
the
return
of
some
other
entity
or
person
contains
an
error
in
reporting
the
same
transaction
does
not
excuse
the
taxpayer
of
his
duty
to
properly
state
his
own
income
on
his
own
return.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
understood
your
question
to
premise
that
the
corporate
return
had...
the
period
had
closed
for
that
year.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
if
that
corporation's
return
period
has
closed,
it
cannot
be
reopened.
we
mention
in
our
brief
certain
mitigation
provisions
that
could
apply
when...
in
other
circumstances,
but
those
wouldn't
apply
here.
this
court
reached
a
similar
conclusion
in
the
bull
v.
united
states
case
which
held
that
the
commissioner
properly
could
assess
an
income
tax
on
an
item
that
had
been
previously,
but
erroneously
reported
as
an
estate
tax
item
on
a
different
return
that
was
no
longer
open
for
correction.
the
point...
the
general
point
is
that
under
6501
each
return
starts
a
period
of
limitations
and
the
service
is
responsible
for
determining
the
taxable
income
and
the
amount
of
tax
to
be
imposed
on
that
return
regardless
of
whether
the
same
information
is
reported
incorrectly
somewhere
else.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
rule
that
we
are
describing
is
identical
for
subchapter
c,
subchapter
s
partnerships.
whatever
other
return
has
been
filed,
the
information
on
that
return
does
not
prevent
the
commissioner
on
a
timely
basis
with
respect
to
the
individual
who
received
that
income
from
adjusting...
making
adjustments
on
the
individual's
return.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
we
disagree
with
his
reading
of
6501.
we
also
disagree
with
his
reading
of
6037
which
deals
only
with
subchapter
s's.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the...
this
court's
opinion
in
the
munter
case
is
the
closest
direct
authority
on
that
question,
although
we
think
that
the
proposition
is
answered
by
all
of
the
cases
that
i've
already
cited,
which
hold
that
an
error
on
some
other
return
doesn't
prevent
an
adjustment
on
the
taxpayer's
return.
the
munter
case
held
that
the
service
could
recharacterize
income
as
dividend
income
even
though
it
had
been
claimed
to
be
a
return
of
capital
by
the
taxpayer.
the
service
was
allowed
to
adjust
the
shareholder's
return
many
years
after
the
events
had
occurred
that
were
the
basis
of
this
characterization
issue.
the
events
that
were
the
basis
of
the
characterization
issue
was
how
the
corporation
had
reported
its
earnings
and
profits
over
the
prior
decade.
so,
the
fact
that
the
corporation
in
the
munter
case
had
taken
a
certain
position
with
respect
to
its
earnings
and
profits
and...
did
not
prevent
the
commissioner
from
restating...
from
adjusting
the
shareholder's
return
properly
to
state
the
shareholder's
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
those
are
utterly
independent
issues.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
need
an
extension
if
you
want...
from
the
corporation
if
you
want
to
adjust
its
return.
you
need
an
extension
from
the
individual
if
you
want
to
adjust
his
return.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
petitioner's
argument
really
misses
the
point
in
asserting
that
section
6501
prevents
adjustments
to
the
return
of
a
subchapter
s
corporation
after
the
time
for
assessing
taxes
against
the
subchapter
s
corporation
has
expired.
when
the
service
adjusts
a
taxpayer's
return
and
assesses
tax
against
the
shareholder's
income,
it
is
not
adjusting
the
subchapter
s
corporation
return.
the
adjustments
and
the
assessment
are
made
on
the
individual's
return,
not
on
the
corporation's.
the
income
involved
is
the
individual's
income,
not
the
corporation's,
and
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
individual,
not
on
the
corporation.
the
second
circuit
summarized
this
issue
in
the
siben
case
when
they
said
the
return
that
starts
the
running
of
the
limitations
period
is
that
of
the
taxpayer
whose
liability
is
being
assessed
and
not
that
of
a
third
person
who
also
reports
the
transaction.
the
subchapter
s
return
is
obviously
not
the
return
upon
which
tax
can
be
assessed
upon
the
individual
shareholder.
the
corporate
return
doesn't
contain
any
of
the
individualized
information
or
any
of
the
information
about
other
sources
of
income
that
are
required
to
assess
a
tax
against
the
individual.
in
the
automobile
club
case
in
this
court,
the
court
held
that
an
information
return
that
lacks
the
data
necessary
for
the
calculation
and
assessment
of
deficiencies
is
not
a
tax
return
within
the
contemplation
of
section
6501.
in
this
respect,
the
subchapter
s
return
is
not
functionally
different
from
a
w-2
return
filed
by
an
employer
reporting
wages
under
section
6041
of
the
code
or
by...
or
from
a
form
1099
filed
by
a
bank
reporting
interest
income
under
section
6049
of
the
code.
in
all
of
these
situations,
the
information
that
has
been
provided
to
the
service
is
relevant
to
the
calculation
of
the
individual's
taxes,
but
none
is
sufficient
to
determine
the
taxpayer's
taxable
income.
they,
therefore,
cannot
constitute
the
return
that
commences
the
period
for
assessment
of
taxes
against
the
individual.
turning
to
section
6037,
which
deals
specifically
with
s
corporations,
under
that
statute
the
return
of
the
s
corporation
serves
two
separate
functions.
it
serves
as
an
information
return
providing
data
relevant
to
the
calculation
of
the
shareholder's
taxes.
indeed,
section
6037
is
contained
within
chapter
61,
part
3
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
is
entitled,
information
returns.
the
return
of
the
subchapter
s
corporation
also
serves
as
the
tax
return
of
the
s
corporation
in
the
narrow
circumstances
when
that
corporation
is
subject
to
tax.
as
congress
explained
in
enacting
section
6037
in
1958,
when
the
s
corporation
is
itself
subject
to
tax,
the
return
of
the
s
corporation
commences
the
period
of
limitations
for
assessment
of
tax
against
the
shareholders.
petitioner's
suggestion
that
our
interpretation
of
section
6037,
which
is
simply
congress'
interpretation
of
that
statute,
somehow
renders
the
statute
meaningless
simply
ignores
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
says
when
the
statute
works
and
what
it
does.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
that
situation,
the
shareholder,
if
he
overreported
his
income,
would
be
entitled
to
seek,
if
appropriate,
a
refund.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certainly.
the
information
return
is
just
that.
it's
information.
it's
not
binding.
it's
not
a
finding.
it's
not
a
determination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
information.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
in
fact,
one
of
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
to
you
involves
that
situation.
i
think
it
was
leonhart,
but
it
might
have
been
durovic.
but
in
those...
yes,
if
the
subchapter
s
return
contains
an
erroneous
information
and
if
the
shareholder
has
a...
if
there
is
a
basis
for
ascribing
knowledge
to
the
shareholder
of
that
error,
that
would
be
a
basis
for
a
penalty
assessment
against
the
individual.
in
enacting
the
unified
accounting
procedures
for
large
partnerships
and
large
s
corporations
in
1982
in
the
statute
known
as
tefra,
congress
agreed
with
the
case
law
in
stating
that
under
present
law
the
filing
of...
by
the
corporation
of
its
return
does
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
how
far
back
should
i
go?
i'll
start
the
whole
sentence.
in
enacting
the
unified
accounting
procedures
for
large
s
corporations
and
large
partnerships
in
1982
in
the
statute
known
as
tefra,
congress
agreed
with
the
case
law
in
stating
that
under
present
law
the
filing
by
the
corporation
of
its
return
does
not
affect
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
individual
shareholders.
in
a
limited
category
of
cases
for
years
after
1982,
congress
changed
that
result.
in
the
ordinary
case,
however,
involving
95
percent
of
subchapter
s
corporations
that
have
five
or
fewer
shareholders,
congress
retained
the
preexisting
provisions
of
section
6037.
thus,
the
prior
law
that
congress
described
in
enacting
tefra
is
still
the
current
law
for
most
s
corporations.
and
as
petitioner
recognizes,
congress'
description
of
section
37
is
thus
authoritative
for
years
after
1982.
petitioner
conceded
that
in
footnote
47
of
their
brief.
giving
section
6037
the
same
meaning
before
1982,
as
it
has
after
1982,
is
appropriate,
as
this
court
said
in
the
west
virginia
university
hospital
case,
to
make
sense
rather
than
nonsense
out
of
the
corpus
juris.
moreover,
the
interpretation
that
congress
provided
of
section
6037,
both
in
1958
and
in
1982,
is
a
reasonable
and
logical
one.
it
was
made
by
congress
in
performance
of
its
legislative
function
in
enacting
intertwining
amendments
to
a
complex
statutory
scheme,
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
seatrain
shipbuilding
and
red
lion
broadcasting,
congress'
views
should
be
given
great
weight.
i
should
point
out
that
petitioner's
contrary
interpretation
of
section
6037
would
mean
that
congress
enacted
a
nullity
when
it
enacted
tefra
and
applied
it
to
the
unified
statute
of
limitations
provisions
for
large
s
corporations
after
1982
because,
under
petitioner's
view,
the
same
unified
statute
of
limitations
would
be
reached
for
all
large
and
small
s
corporations
both
before
and
1982
if
section
6037
had
the
meaning
for
which
they
contend.
petitioner
didn't
have
time
to
mention
it,
but
the
case
that's
on
his
side
in
this
area
is
the
kelley
case
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit.
and
what
the
kelley
decision
held
was
that
it
was
more
fair
if
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
shareholder
and
for
the
s
corporation
were
coterminus.
the
court
reasoned
that
the
shareholder
may
have
difficulty
obtaining
necessary
books
and
records
after
the
period
of
limitations
has
expired
for
assessing
taxes
against
the
corporation.
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
green,
fehlhaber,
and
in
this
case
all
explain
why
that
concern
has
no
weight.
taxpayers
often
need
information
from
third
parties.
there's
nothing
exceptional
about
that,
and
indeed,
in
the
context
of
s
corporations,
they
have
even
a
greater
ability
to
obtain
the
information
that
they
desire
because
by
definition
there
are
few
shareholders,
each
of
whom
is
likely
to
have
a
greater
input
in
the
operations
of
the
corporation.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
mr.
bufferd
is
the
secretary
and
treasurer
of
compo.
he
quite
obviously
had
the
ability
to
obtain
and
retain
any
records
that
he
wanted.
and
just
to
gild
the
lily,
the
records
in
this
case
have
no
meaning
because
petitioner
conceded
from
the
outset
that
the
deficiencies
that
the
service
found
in
their
return
were
correct
on
the
merits.
he
hasn't
contended
that
the
books
and
records
would
somehow
change
that.
in
any
event,
whatever
force
the
concerns
expressed
in
the
kelley
case
might
be,
they
provide
no
basis
for
ignoring
the
plainly
limited
language
of
section
6501
or
the
clear
history
of
6037
and
its
clear
provisions.
by
limiting
the
time
for
assessing
taxes,
section
6501
does
not
limit
the
amount
of
taxes
to
be
assessed
on
a
proper
accounting
of
the
taxpayer's
income.
i
would
only
like
to
make
one
other
point
in
response
to
a
question
by
justice
blackmun.
justice
blackmun
brought
up
the
fact
that
it
is
possible,
it
is
conceivable
for
the
service
to
obtain
extensions
from
s
corporations
and
thereby
avoid
this
issue.
while
it
may
be
possible
and
conceivable,
the
commissioner
has
no
leverage
over
s
corporations
to
require
them
to
cooperate
and
provide
an
extension
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
s
corporation
has
no
liability
for
taxes.
in
the
normal
case,
it
is
possible
to
obtain...
it
is
possible
that
a
taxpayer
might
have
an
interest
in
granting
an
extension
because
if
he
doesn't,
the
commissioner
will
then
have
to
assess
the
highest
supportable
level
of
taxes,
but
there
is
no
such
reason
or
ability
to
coerce
or
obtain
an
agreement
from
an
s
corporation
because
it
has
no
exposure
to
taxes
and
the
commissioner
has
no
basis
to
require
it
to
give
an
extension.
i...
since
time
permits,
i'll
just
take
one
other
second
to
talk
about
the
suggestion
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
6037
only
contains
one
example
and
that
our
position
relies
upon
only
that
example.
what
the
history
of
section
6037
says
is
that
the
return
of
the
corporation
will
constitute
the
return
of
the...
rather,
the
return
of
the
corporation
will
commence
the
statute
running
against
the
corporation
when
it
is
not
entitled
to
subchapter
s
treatment.
there's
more
than
one
reason
why
a
corporation
would
not
be
entitled
to
subchapter
s
treatment,
but
in
addition,
a
subchapter
s
that
is
entitled
not
to
pay
a
tax
can
have
that...
even
in
1958,
can
have
that
entitlement
terminated
if
he
receives...
if
that
corporation
receives
too
much
income
from
what
are
called
passive
sources
or
from
foreign
sources.
and
those
provisions
are
also
set
out
in
footnote
17
of
petitioner's
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
