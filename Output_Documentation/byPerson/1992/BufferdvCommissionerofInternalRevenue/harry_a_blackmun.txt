harry

blackmun
professor
filler,
if
you
should
prevail
here,
i
suppose
all
the
government
will
do
in
the
future
is
to
get
an
872
out
of
the
corporations.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
so
all
you're
winning
here
is
a
procedural
thing
except
for
the
present
case,
of
course.
but
the
government
can
make
up
for
it
just
by
changing
its
procedures.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jones,
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
lift
your
voice
a
little
bit
and--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--don't
speak
quite
so
softly.
