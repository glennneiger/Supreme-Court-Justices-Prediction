mr.
stuart
jay
filler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
case.
petitioner
recognizes
that
this
court
in
the
badaracco
case
decided
that
a
statute
of
limitations
should
be
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
government.
in
this
case,
however,
this
court
must
add
phrases
to
an
otherwise
clear
and
unambiguous
set
of
statutory
provisions
in
order
to
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
below.
petitioner
believes
that
this
court
did
not
intend
in
their
prescription
in
badaracco
to
mean
that
every
time
there
is
a
statute
of
limitation
issue,
the
government
wins.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
three
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provide
a
statute
of
limitations
which
bars
adjustments
to
a
shareholder's
income
tax
return
with
respect
to
items
appearing
on
an
s
corporation's
income
tax
return.
the
three
provisions
are
section
6501(a),
section
6037,
and
section
6012
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
as
amended
and
in
effect
for
1979,
the
taxable
year
at
issue
in
this
case.
all
three
provisions
are
on
page
1
and
2
of
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits,
if
the
court
wishes
to
refer
to
them.
it
is
important
to
note
that
congress
in
1958
created
an
entirely
new
entity
for
federal
tax
purposes.
this
entity
was
separate
and
distinct
from
its
shareholders.
the
irs,
not
congress,
created
a
form
1120s
which
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
form
1040
filed
by
the
shareholders.
congress...
the
irs,
not
congress,
also
created
a
form
k-1
and
required
the
corporation
to
provide
the
shareholders
annually
with
a
form
k-1
which
reported
the
bottom
line
results
of
the
s
corporation
for
the
taxable
year,
and
the
shareholder
was
required
to
attach
this
form
k-1
to
the
shareholder's
form
1040
and
report
on
the
shareholder's
return
the
bottom
line
results
of
the
s
corporation
for
the
taxable
year.
while
examining
the
shareholder's
return,
an
irs
employee
must
retrieve
the
form
1120s,
must
examine
the
form
1120s,
and
must
adjust
the
form
1120s.
pursuant
to
section
6501(a)
of
the
code,
these
adjustments
must
be
made
within
the
3-year
period
of
limitations.
only
then
can
the
irs
adjust
the
return
of
the
shareholder
with
respect
to
the
items
appearing
on
the
s
corporation
return.
if
additional
time
is
required
for
an
adjustment
to
be
made,
the
irs
employee
may
obtain
an
extension
of
the
period
of
limitations
for
either
the
s
corporation
return,
the
shareholder's
return,
or
both
returns.
in
fact,
that
is
exactly
what
the
internal
revenue
service
did
in
the
case
at
bar
in
1980,
the
taxable
year
following
the
year
in
dispute
in
this
case,
and
the
1980
taxable
year
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
okay.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
think
the
government
would
not
dispute,
frankly,
your
honor,
that
if
this
were
a
c
corporation
and
an
adjustment
of
the
c
corporation
were
necessary
in
order
to
adjust
a
shareholder's
return...
and
i
provided
such
an
example
in
my
brief
with
respect
to
a
dividend,
okay?
if
it
was
necessary
to
adjust
a
c
corporation's
return,
that
they
would
not
and
could
not
adjust
a
c
corporation's
shareholder's
return
with
respect
to
the
item
after
the
c
corporation's
period
of
limitations
has
expired.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
why
is
that?
because
section
6012(a)(2)
of
the
code
provides
that
a
c
corporation,
or
a
corporation
subject
to
taxation...
and
by
the
way,
provided
that
much
prior
to
1958,
when
the
s
corporation
was
created
and
carved
out--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--yes,
i
am.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
and
section
6501(a)
of
the
code
provides
that
a
3-year
period
of
limitations
from
that
return...
from
the
filing
of
that
return
is
applicable
to
the
c
corporation's
return.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
congress
created
two
separate
and
distinct
entities.
in
the
case
of
a
c
corporation,
when
originally
created,
it
was
what
we
call
a
separate
and
distinct
taxable
entity.
it
reports
its
items
of
income
and
deductions
and
pays
a
tax
at
the
c
corporation
level.
distributions
to
the
shareholders
are
only
taxed
to
the
shareholders
if
they
can
be
treated
as
a
dividend
within
the
meaning
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
adjustments
at
the
c
corporation
level
must
be
made
within
the
c
corporation's
separate
entity
return
within
the
period
of
limitations
or
section
6012(a)
has
no
meaning.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i'm
sorry
i
haven't
made
it
clear,
your
honor,
but
let
me
try
one
more
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
section
6012(a)(2)
of
the
code
requires
a
corporation
subject
to
taxation
to
file
a
return.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
okay.
and
section
6501(a)
says,
okay,
that
the
period
of
limitations
with
respect
to
that
return
is
3
years
from
the
date
of
filing
that
return,
that
adjustments
to
assess
a
tax
within
that
period,
whether
the
tax
is
on
the
c
corporation
or
the
c
corporation's
shareholders,
must
be
made
within
the
3-year
period
applicable
to
the
c
corporation
return.
and
frankly,
your
honor--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--6501(a).
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
believe
it
does,
sir,
and
i
believe
it
says
it
clearly.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
12?
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
with
the
c
corporation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
think
i
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
order
to
have
a
case
for
me
to
cite,
the
government
would
have
had
to
attempted
at
least
to
assess
such
a
tax
against
the
shareholder
after
the
c
corporation's
return
was
filed.
in
all
my
research,
your
honor,
i
was
unable
to
determine...
or
find
such
a
case,
and
i
provided
that
example--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there
is
authority
in
the
terms
of
corporate
tax
textbooks
and
other
materials
which
are
in
use
as
acceptor
of
other
authorities
that
have
always
i
think
interpreted
the
c
corporation's
period
of
limitations
under
6501(a)
to
be
the
filing
of
the
return,
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
return
under
6501(a),
and
that
in
order
to
adjust
the
c
corporation's
return
with
respect
to
tax
imposed
either
on
the
c
corporation...
it's
a
separate
taxable
entity...
or
the
shareholder,
it
must
be
done
within
the
period
of
limitations
of
the
c
corporation--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--which
is
3
years
from
date
of
filing.
sorry.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
well,
it
says
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section.
i'll
go
to
reading
it
just
for
a
moment.
the
amount
of
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
shall
be
assessed
within
3
years--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--okay.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
the
critical
language
is
3
years
after
the
return
was
filed.
what
the
government
wishes--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--yes.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
yes,
your
honor,
but
they
are
two
separate
and
distinct
entities,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
fail
to
recognize
that.
they
are
two
separate
and
distinct
taxable
entities
in
the
case
of
a
c
corporation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
well,
i
can
only
say,
your
honor,
that
in
thorough
research,
that
there
is
nothing
from
anyone
or
any
source
or
any
material
written
to
believe
that
congress
was
not
clear.
i
mean,
of
course,
6501(a)
and
c
corporations
were
created
back
at
the...
almost
at
the
beginning
of
the
history
of
the
income
tax,
back
in
the
late
teens...
1914,
1915
was
the
whole
concept
developed...
that
this
c
corporation
was
a
separate
taxable
entity.
the
s
corporation
that
we
are
confronted
with
today
is
an
entity
created
only
in
1958
where,
in
effect,
you
might
say
part
of
the
heart
of
the
c
corporation
was
pulled
out
and
part
of
the
provisions
of
the...
for
the
s
corporation
were
enacted,
okay,
to
change
the
implications
in
some
ways
for
a
c
corporation.
but
many
of
the
similarities
of
c
corporate
tax
treatment
are
the
same
for
s
corporations
as
they
are
for
c
corporations.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prior
to
the
lunch
break,
we
were
discussing
the
critical
language
of
section
6501(a)
which
provides
that
the
period
of
limitation
for
assessment
is
3
years
from
the
date
the
return...
the
return...
was
filed.
the
real
issue
then
before
the
court
is
identifying
what
congress
meant
by
the
term,
the
return,
in
section
6501(a).
petitioner's
position
is
that
the
return
can
only
be
identified
in
the
case
of
an
s
corporation
with
reference
to
the
second
sentence
of
section
6037
of
the
code
which
provides
that
any
return
filed
pursuant
to
this
section,
which
must
mean
every
return
filed
pursuant
to
this
section,
shall,
for
purposes
of
chapter
66
relating
to
limitations,
be
treated
as
a
return
filed
by
the
corporation
under
section
6012.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
section
6501(a)
that
refers
to
the
shareholder's
income
tax
return
as
the
relevant
return
for
purposes
of
beginning
the
running
of
the
period
of
limitations.
only
by
adding
the
phrase...
only
by
adding
the
phrase...
against
whom
the
tax
is
imposed
to
the
language
of
section
6501(a)
may
this
court
reach
the
conclusion
of
the
second
circuit
and
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
that
it's
the
shareholder's
return
that's
referred
to
in
section
6501(a).
they
would
have
to
add
the
phrase
so
that
section
6501(a)
read
as
follows:
the
amount
of
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
shall
be
assessed
within
3
years
after
the
return
against
whom
the
tax
is
imposed
was
filed.
that
language
is
not
present
in
section
6501(a).
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
ignores
the
fact
that
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
taxable
entities.
under
section
65...
6012,
rather,
(a)(1)
of
the
code,
the
shareholder
is
a
separate
taxable
entity
and
must
file
a
return
that
has
the
period
of
limitations
under
6501(a).
section
6012(a)(2)
creates
a
separate
return
for
a
separate
taxable
entity,
the
corporation,
the
c
corporation,
which
must
also
file
a
return,
or
by
reference
to
the
second
sentence
of
section
6012,
the
s
corporation
return
is
treated
as
a
corporate
return
under
section
6012
for
purposes
of
the
period
of
limitation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i'm
sorry
now.
no.
it's
the
corporate
return,
the
s
corporation
return,
that's
treated
as
a
return.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
that's
what
i
said.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
that's
correct.
it
is
the
s
corporation's
return
that
is
treated
as
a
corporate
return
filed
pursuant
to
section
6012
that
is
the
return
in
the
language
of
6501(a)
that
begins
the
running
of
the
period
of
limitations
from
the
date
that
return,
that
s
corporation
return,
was
filed.
yes,
justice.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
nor
does
it
say,
as
the
second
circuit
held,
your
honor,
that
the
relevant
return
is
the
return
against
whom
the
tax
is
imposed.
but
reading
the
language
in
the
way
the
court
has
implied
and
the
second
circuit
held
would
require
the
commissioner
to
make
an
annual
examination
of
all
the
financial
transactions
on
a
return
that's
filed,
and
if
the
commissioner
could
adjust
the
returns
such
that
a
tax
could
be
imposed
against
that
return,
then
the
second
circuit
and
respondent
argue
that
that
return
has
a
period
of
limitations.
if
there
is
no
tax
that
could
be
imposed
against
the
s
corporation
return,
the
second
circuit
held
and
the
respondent
would
argue
that
there
is
no
period
of
limitations.
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
section
6037,
6012,
or
6501(a)
that
indicates
that
congress
intended,
okay,
that
this
one
return
have
two
separate
and
distinct
period
of
limitations:
one
when
a
tax
was
assessed--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--and
one
when
the
tax
was
not
assessed--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--well,
then
if...
reading
it
that
way,
your
honor,
you've
ignored
the...
or
read
out
of
the
code,
in
effect,
repealed
effectively,
i
think
the
second
sentence
of
section
6037
which
says,
any
return
filed
pursuant
to
this
section,
which
means
every
s
corporation
return,
whether
it's
subject
to
tax
or
whether
it's
not
subject--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--which,
if
you
read
the
first
sentence
of...
is
the
return
required
to
be
filed
annually
by
every
s
corporation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
okay.
so,
the
first
sentence
says
they
must
file
a
return,
and
then
congress
added
a
second
sentence
that
says
any
return
filed
pursuant
to
this
section,
okay,
has
a
period
of
limitations
for
purposes
of
section
6501(a)
as
a
corporation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
the
return
is
treated
as
a
corporate
return.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
because
section
6501(a)
provides
the
period
of
limitations
for
all
returns
required
to
be
filed
whether...
and
all
returns
that--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--are
required
to
be
filed
are
under
section--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
because
section
6037
says
it
shall
be
a
corporate
return...
it
shall
be
treated
as
a
corporate
return
under
section
6012,
and
when
you
go
to
section
6012,
and
you
have
a
corporate
return
filed,
the
period
of
limitations
for
the
filing
of
that
return
and
all
returns
filed
under
6012
is
section
6501(a).
so,
section
6037
puts
us
in
6012,
which
puts
us
in
6501
because
there's
no
other
way
to
create
a
period
of
limitations
for
that--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--it
has
to
be
implicit,
your
honor,
because
there's
no
way
to
ever
create
a
limitation
period
for
that
return
even
if
it
was
capable
of
a
tax
being
assessed.
if
you
don't
get
to
6012,
okay,
from--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--the
purpose
of
the
period
of
limitations,
as
is
true
of
all
periods
of
limitations,
is
to
create
a
deadline,
a
deadline
upon
which
the
two
parties
to,
in
this
case,
a
tax
transaction,
but
any
period
of
limitations...
in
which
each
party
must
act
in
order
to
bring
finality
to
the
process,
in
this
case
the
tax
return
or
the
taxable
year
in
question
in
a
case.
and
the
subchapter
s
corporation
is
a
separate
entity,
distinct
from
its
shareholders,
okay,
and
has
a
period
of...
congress
provided
a
period
of
limitations.
the
second
circuit
errs
by
attempting
to
analogize
the
return
of
an
s
corporation
to
that
of
a
partnership
rather
than
a
c
corporation.
section
6031
of
the
code
provides
that
a
partnership
must
file
an
annual
return
similar
to
that
filed
under
the
first
sentence
of
section
6037
for
an
s
corporation.
however,
congress
did
not
add
a
second
sentence
to
section
6031
that
it
did
to
section
6037,
and
congress
specifically
provided
in
that
second
sentence
that
every
return
filed
by
a
subchapter
s
corporation
has
a
period
of
limitations.
we
cannot
ignore
the
clear
and
unambiguous
language
of
that
section.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
understand
that
no
one
is
trying
to
impose
a
tax,
but
they
must
make...
let
me
see
if
i
can
state
it
this
way.
in
order
to
impose
the
tax
on
the
shareholder,
they
must
first
make
adjustments
to
the
s
corporation
return.
only
by
determining--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--that
an
error
was
made
on
the
s
corporation
return
and
adjusting
that
and
therefore
reaching
a
different
bottom
line
result
for
the
operations
of
the
s
corporation
as
reported
on
its
form
may
they
then
adjust
the
shareholder's
return.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
well,
when
congress
created,
your
honor,
the
second
sentence
of
section
6037
in
1958,
there
was
no
income
tax
imposed
on
an
s
corporation,
no
tax
at
all.
and
yet,
they
added
the
second
sentence
of
section
6037,
which
says
that
a
return
filed
pursuant
to
that
section,
which
can
only...
cannot
include,
rather,
a
return
upon
which
a
tax
was
assessed.
in
1958
when
they...
and
your
interpretation
or
your
attempted
interpretation
of
that
sentence
effectively
repeals
the
sentence
from
1958
until
1966
when
for
the
first
time
congress
added
a
tax
directly
on
an
s
corporation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
wish
to
reserve--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--yes,
sir,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
okay.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
in
following
that...
was
x
a
corporation?
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
oh,
two
individuals.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
one...
x
loans
y
money
and
y
pays...
and
x
pays
y
interest?
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
is
there
anything
that
says
that
the
debtor
and
the
creditor
in
a
case
must
be
treated
consistently?
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
the...
yes,
i
believe
that
that
is
correct,
that
should
the
payee,
shall
we
say,
of
the
interest
not
have
reported
it,
but
the
payor
deducted
it,
okay,
and
the
period
of
limitations
lapsed
on
the
payee,
the
irs
could
not
come
in
and
add
that
to
the
payee's
income.
if
that's
your
question.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i'm
sorry.
i
hope
i
answered
it.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
know,
but
there's
no
interrelationship
in
the
very
real
sense
of
a
shareholder
and
owner
of
a
corporation
between
two
individuals
who
simply
loan
and
borrow
money,
i
don't
think,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
the
analogy
flows.
the
congress
specifically
created
under
section
6037
a
requirement
that
this
whole
new
entity
it
created
in
1958,
the
s
corporation,
have
a
period
of
limitations
separate
and
distinct
from
that
of
its
shareholders,
and
that
the
entities
were
separate
and
distinct
for
purposes
of
income
taxation.
so,
i'm
not
sure...
at
least
having
the
question
first
thrown
at
me
at
this
moment,
i'm
not
sure
that
there's...
the
analogy
follows.
i
think
that's
the
best
way
i
can
respond.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
yes,
sir,
and
in
fact,
they've
done
it.
they've
done
it
on
many
occasions.
in
our
case,
in
the
very
case
at
bar,
in
1980,
the
tax
year
following
the
year
at
issue,
the
service
did
obtain
an
extension
for
the
s
corporation's
return,
were
able
then
to
make
adjustments
to
the
return,
were
able
to
adjust
the
taxpayer's
return.
in
order
to
make
the
adjustments
for
an
s...
i
mean,
for
a
tax
shareholder,
they've
got
to
have
the
s
corporation
return
right
in
front
of
them.
they
can't
make
it
just
by
guessing.
they
examine
the
books
and
records.
at
that
time,
if
they're
running
out
of
time,
they
can
obtain
such
an
extension.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
and
i
think
it's
clear,
your
honor,
that
that's
what
congress
intended
the
government
to
do
in
1958
when
it
created
the
second
sentence
of
section
6037,
and
any
other
holding
ignores
that
second
sentence
to
the
extent
that
i
really
and
truly
believe
it
repeals
that
second
sentence
of
section
6037.
if
i
may
reserve--
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
--i
appreciate
the
opportunity.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
i
can
only
go
back
to
the
beginning,
and
that
is
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
6037
provides
any
return
filed
by
an
s
corporation
shall
be
treated
as
a
return
of
a
corporation
pursuant
to
section
6012.
the
second
circuit
makes
a
major...
and
the
respondent...
major
chronological
error
by
attempting
to
interpret
section
6037
in
1958
as
a
provision
that
only
applies
to
a
corporation
when
it
is
subject
to
tax.
in
1958,
the
subchapter
s
corporation
was
not
subject
to
tax.
it
was
not
until
1966,
8
years
afterwards,
that
a
tax
was
first
imposed
on
an
s
corporation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
the
committee
reports
in
the
1958
legislation
specifically
provide
that
the
congress
knew
that
a
subchapter
s
corporation
was
not
subject
to
tax.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
yes,
but
in
that
case,
the
congress
could
not
have
drafted
the
second
sentence
saying
any
return
filed
pursuant
to
this
section
or
every
return
filed
pursuant
to
this
section
because
every
return
would
have
to
include
returns
in
which
the
corporation
had
properly
elected
to
be
an
s
corporation.
mr.
stuart
jay
filler
thank
you,
your
honor.
