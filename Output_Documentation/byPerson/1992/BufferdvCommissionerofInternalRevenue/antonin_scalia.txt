justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
filler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
what
if
this
were
a
subchapter
c
corporation?
what
is
the
normal
treatment
of...
i
report
something
on
my
personal
income
tax
return
which
turns
out
to
be
wrong
because
the
subchapter
c
corporation
gave
me
information,
which
it
also
reported
on
its
return,
that
turns
out
to
be
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
if
it's
more
than
3
years
ago
that
the
subchapter
c
corporation
did
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
filler,
you
say
that
you
don't
want
to
add
in
that
phrase
in
6501(a),
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
necessary
to
read
in
some
phrase,
because
it
says
within
3
years
after
the
return
was
filed.
the
return.
what...
i
mean,
the
question
comes
immediately
to
mind,
what
return?
it
doesn't...
it
does
not
say
within
3
years
after
all
relevant
returns
were
filed,
but
after
the
return
was
filed.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
what
about
the
private
taxpayer,
the
individual
taxpayer,
who
is
relying
on
the
information
return?
do
i
understand
the
situation
to
be
thus,
that
if
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
information
return
that
is
against
the
government's
interest,
the
government
can
ignore
that
mistake
and
make
believe
it
never
happened
and
go
against
the
individual
as
though
the
s
corporation
had
filed
properly?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
if
the
mistake
is
in
the
other
direction?
what
if
there
is
a
mistake
that's
against
the
government's
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
he
do
that?
i
mean,
he
does
not
have
to
get
a
new
information
return
somehow
filed
by
the
corporation?
he
can
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
corporation's
return
even
after
it
has
been
closed?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
