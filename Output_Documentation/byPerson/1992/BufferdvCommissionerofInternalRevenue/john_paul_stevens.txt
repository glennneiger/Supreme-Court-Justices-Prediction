may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
filler?
i
don't
really
follow
your
argument.
there's
nothing
that
says
about
two
different
periods
of
limitations,
but
it's
one
or
the
other
each
time.
in
the
s
corporation,
there's
no
tax
assessed
against
it,
at
least
during
the
time
involved
here.
so,
you
don't
need
a
period
of
limitations.
justice
john

that's
any
return
filed
pursuant
to
6037.
right?
justice
john

all
right.

justice
john

where
do
you
get

out
of

justice
john

you
mean
it's
implicit,
it's
not
explicit.
justice
john

what
purpose
does
the
limitations
period
serve
with
respect
to
a
return
for
which
no
tax
is...
pursuant
to
which
no
tax
is
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
mr.
filler,
he
makes
the
point
that
it
might
not
have
thought
it
was
subject
to
tax,
but
it
didn't
qualify
as
s
corporation
status,
and
therefore
you
need
to
limit
the
period
in
which
a
tax
might
be
assessed
against
it
when
it
made
that
mistake.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
taxpayer
might
have
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
it
was
qualified.
the
person
who
prepared
the
s
corporation
return
might
have
erroneously
thought
it
was
qualified
as
an
s
corporation
when,
in
fact,
it
was
not,
and
the
period
of
making
that
determination
is
then
set
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
