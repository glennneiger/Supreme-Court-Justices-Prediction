chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-7804,
sheldon
bufferd
v.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
filler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
cited--
--why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
now,
but
you're
trying
to
answer
my
question,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
continue--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
why
should
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
c
corporation's
return
prevent
an
adjustment
in
the
taxpayer's
return
when
the
taxpayer...
when
an
extension
was
obtained
with
respect
to
him?
why
is
the
government
bound
with
respect
to
the
individual
taxpayer
about
some
item
on
the
c
corporation's
return?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
made
that
statement,
but
i
simply
don't...
i
must
say
i
don't
follow
your
reasoning.
i
don't
understand
from
what
you've
said
what
statutory
provision
or
what
case
it
is
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
the
government
is
bound
in
adjusting
an
individual
taxpayer's
return,
which
it
has
extended
the
time
for,
by
the
figures
in
a
c
return,
which
it
has
not
extended
the
time
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
you've
made
it
as
clear
as
it
can
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
6501(a)(2)
says...
610--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--6501
says
all
of
what
you
have
just
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
filler--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--6501(a)
to
me
does
not
say
what
you
said
it
said.
it
does
not
say
that
the
government
is
bound
not
to
examine
into
the
taxpayer's
return
on
matters
that
are
covered
in
the
c
return
just
because
the
c
return
period
is
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
now,
stop
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
critical
language?
is
that
the
critical--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
that
the
critical
language
right
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
assessing
this
under
an
extension
of
the
3-year
period
on
the
individual.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
you
are
simply
stating,
so
far
as
i
know,
without
pointing
to
any
statutory
authority
that
the
government
cannot
reexamine
anything
that
comes
out
of
a
c
return
on
an
individual's
return
if
the
time
for
examining
the
c
return
hasn't
been
extended.
now,
i
simply
don't
see
in
your
reference
to
6501(a)
anything
that
deals
with
that.
maybe
you
derived
some
implication
from
it,
but
it
certainly
isn't
express.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
filler,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
natural
to
read
it
in
by
implication,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
language,
mr.
filler,
no
one
is
trying
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
subchapter
corporation
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--now,
just
stop
a
minute,
mr.
filler,
and
let
me
ask.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
another
assumption
here
that
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
for...
maybe
you
know
of
some...
that
in
order
to
assess
the
taxpayer,
they
have
to
make
adjustments
on
the
subchapter
s
return
even
though
they're
not
trying
to
impose
any
tax
on
the
subchapter
s
corporation.
why
do
they
have
to
do
anything
with
the
subchapter
s
return?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
filler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
filler,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
filler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
