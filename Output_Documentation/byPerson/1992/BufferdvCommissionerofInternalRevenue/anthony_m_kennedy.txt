justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
the
same
problem
as
the
chief
justice
did.
in
your
brief
at
page
12,
you
give
this
example,
but
you
cite--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you
cite
absolutely
no
authority,
no
text,
no
statute,
no
regulations,
no
case.
it's
just
an
assertion.
now,
the
government
doesn't
frontally
deny
what
you
say.
it
may
do
so
at
oral
argument,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that's
the
whole
issue
in
the
case.
suppose
that
a
corporation
makes
a
distribution.
it
treats
it
as
not
out
of
earnings
and
profits.
the
corporation's
tax
year
closes,
and
it's
then
found
that
there
was...
it
is
very
clear
that
this
was
a
distribution
made
out
of
earnings
and
profits.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
why
the
shareholder
can't
be
charged
with
a
dividend.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
indicates
that
that's
the
very
question
before
us
to
be
decided.
you
state
as
a
premise
what
is
really
the
question
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
just
one
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
x
owes
y
on
a
promissory
note.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
x
pays
$1,000.
let's
say
it's
a
$100,000
promissory
note.
and
y,
the
recipient,
says
this
is
principal,
i'm
not
going
to
report
any
interest,
and
y's
tax
year
has
closed.
x
leaves
his
year
open.
can
the
government
go
back
and
say
that
this
is
not
interest,
that
it's
just
principal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
two
individuals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
nothing
that
says
they
have
to
be
treated
consistently,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right,
assuming
one
year...
one
person's
year
is
closed
so
the
irs
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
if
there
are
two
parties
to
a
transaction,
the
tax
year
for
one
can
close
and
the
other
remain
open,
and
the
irs
is
not
foreclosed
from
adjusting
one...
the
open
taxpayer's
return,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
hypothetical,
if
the
corporation
had
been
audited
and
its...
excuse
me...
its
return
closed
and
its
year
closed
and
then
the
employee
was
assessed
the
extra
$40,000,
could
the
corporation
on
its...
now,
wait.
could
the
corporation
reopen
its
year
and
claim
a
deduction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
have
any
authority
for
the
answer
that
you've
given
to
justice
o'connor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
from
your
position
that
if
the
shareholder
knows
or
should
have
known
of
an
error
in
the
sub
s
return
that
you
could
assess
a
negligence
penalty
against
him
for
filing
it?
