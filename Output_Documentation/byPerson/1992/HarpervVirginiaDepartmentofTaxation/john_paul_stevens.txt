justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
because
they
make
the
argument
in
their
brief
that
as
long
as
you
had
a
prepayment
procedure
you
don't
have
to
have
a
host
payment
refund
claim.
that
seems
a
little
inconsistent
with
what
you've
just
said.
is
it...
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law
that...
have
they
already
decided
that
there
is
a
remedy
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
they
make
another
argument,
another
argument
that
there's
some
sort
of
an
equitable
doctrine
of
repose
that
the
virginia
court
can
apply
that
could
be
comparable
to
a
statute
of
limitations
when
they
think
there's
gross
unfairness
in
collecting
a
tax
retroactively?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
that
to
go
not
to
the
question
of
whether
the
rule
of
law
is
retroactive
but
whether
there
really
is
a
state
remedy.
obviously
there
would
not
be
if
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
or
if
they
had
said
in
so
many
words
you
must
file
a
pre,
you
know,
a
prepayment
challenge.
but
they
say
there's
sort
of
another
thing,
i
don't
know
if
there
are
any
cases
that
support
it
but
that
there's
some
sort
of
a,
they
can
create
a
doctrine
of
repose
when
they
are
confronted
with
this
sudden
trauma
that
has
come
over
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you
right
there?
why
would
it
require
it
if
you
acknowledge
that
a
statute
of
limitation
would
bar
it?
anything
barred
by
limitation
the
federal
constitution
doesn't
trump.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
why
does
the
federal
constitution
necessarily
trumps
this
sort
of,
this
new
equitable
doctrine
they're
coming
up
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
though--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
have
any
authorities
in
your
brief
for
the
proposition
that
failure
to
pursue
the
prepayment
remedy
bars
an
otherwise
available
post-payment
refund
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
the
first
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
second
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i'm
assuming
that,
i'm
accepting
your
statement
they
could
have
won
if
they
had
done
it
that
way.
but
the
question
i
have
is
even
so
is
there
anything
saying
their
failure
to
do
it
that
way
bars
their
post--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what's
the
limit...
i'm
not
sure
i...
that
if
they
choose
the
post-refund
remedy
it
comes
with
what
limitation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
all
right.
then
my
second
question
is
at
what
stage
of
this
litigation
did
you
first
advance
this
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
argued
all
the
way
through
that
there's
no
remedy
here
even
if
there
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the...
why
has
not
the
virginia
supreme
court
addressed
that
question
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
state
supreme
court
didn't
deny
it
on
the
ground
there
was
no
remedy.
it
denied
it
because
they
thought
there
was
no
merit
to
the
claim.
they
thought
the
rule
was
not
retroactive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
never
said
that
if
the
rule
is
retroactive
you
don't
have
a
remedy.
at
least
they
haven't
said
it
up
until
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting...
excuse
me.
you
go
ahead.
are
you
suggesting
the
retroactivity
rule
would
be
different
if
the
discrimination
was
say
against
women
instead
of
one
class
of
retirees
and
not
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
on
the,
that
really
for
reasons
i
found
very
persuasive
there
really
was
a
discrimination
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
it
was
discrimination
against
a
class
that
we're
particularly
interested
in
protecting,
say
females.
would
you
make
the
same
remedial
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
you're
making
those
arguments...
i'm
just
asking
you
if
your
basic
argument
about
remedy
would
be
different
if
it
were
a
different
kind
of
discrimination,
if
it
were
a
constitutional
discrimination
against
women
rather
than
statutory
discrimination
against
some
retirees
and
not
the
entire
population.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
hard
to
argue
foreseeability
when
8
members
of
the
court
disagree
with
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
going
to
comment
on
perkins
and
capehart?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
last
question
before
you...
the
second
part
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
opinion
seems
to
me
to
be
responding
to
this
argument
that
you
made,
and
tell
me
if
i
am
right
on
your
presentation.
did
you
argue
that
even
if
it's
not
retroactive
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
it
is
in
any
event
retroactive
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
they
said
no
to
that?
