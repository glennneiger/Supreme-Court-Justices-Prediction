justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
he
had
that
authority,
does
virginia
require
you
to
go
to
the
tax
commissioner
in
order
later
to
ask
for
a
refund?
justice
antonin
scalia
virginia
does
not
say
you
must
go
to
the
tax
commissioner?
you
can
choose
not
to,
pay
the
tax
and
challenge
it
later,
ask
for
a
refund
later,
without
having
gone
to
the
tax
commissioner?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
have
to
pay
it
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand,
you
say
what
the
situation
here
is
that
you
may
go
through
a
protest
procedure
with
the
commissioner,
but
you
need
not.
you
have
the
option
of
either
using
that
or
else
paying
the
tax
and
seeking
a
refund.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
marshall,
are
they...
i
know
they
are
available
but
does
the
state
say
you
must
use
those
and
unless
you
use
those
you
can't
come
in
later,
which
is
what
it
seems
to
me
it's
saying
here?
these
people
came
in
later
and
the
state
is
now
saying
well,
you
could
have
come
in
earlier
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
pay
you.
and
they're
saying
well,
we
could
have
come
in
later
but
you,
earlier
but
you
didn't
tell
us
we
had
to
come
in
earlier.
did
the
state
tell
them
they
had
to
come
in
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
marshall,
did
perkins
and
capehart
make
clear
and
did
you
argue
in
this
case
at
the
trial
court
that
the
rule
is
different
for
post-payment
remedies
than
it
is
for
the
declaratory
judgment
remedy?
i
mean,
if
i
read
perkins
and
capehart
i
would
think
that
that
applies
to
all
remedies
from
the
virginia
supreme
court
for
taxes,
whether
you
do
it
before
or
after.
you're
arguing
now
though
a
very
sophisticated
and
subtle
distinction
between
post-payment
remedies
and
prepayment
remedies.
is
that
clear
in
perkins
and
capehart,
that
had
you
come
earlier
we
wouldn't
play
this
equitable
game,
but
as
it
is
you
have
come
late
and
we
have
a
different
rule
for
post-payment
cases?
is
that
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
do
they
have
such
a
claim
until
you
deny
their
request
for
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
remedy
if
the
state
provides
an
adequate
refund
remedy.
so
if
their
request
for
refund
was
granted
as
they
asked
it
to
be
there
would
have
been
no
constitutional
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that's
like
saying
a
capital,
a
capital
defendant
who
pursues
an
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
is
denied
the
basis
of
his
appeal
cannot
then
come
to
this
court
saying
that
that
denial
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
unless
he
has
before
the
state
court
anticipated
the
denial
and
argued
that
the
denial
would
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
claim
that
they
didn't
have
to,
and
that
gets
back
ultimately
to
the
argument
of
whether
indeed
your
law
required
that
they
make
that
claim
beforehand
or
allows
them
to
do
it
afterwards.
it
all
comes
back
to
that,
i
suppose.
they
weren't
behaving
unreasonably
if
they
thought
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
marshall,
you
describe
this
as
though
it's
a
tort
case,
as
though
what's
at
issue
is
how
blameworthy
was
virginia
and
how
entitled
to...
it's
really
not
that,
it's
just
a
matter
of,
it's
a
simple
federal
statute
that
says
these
people
were
entitled,
given
your
tax
structure,
to
this
amount
of
money.
and
they
come
in
and
they
say
you
took
this
money
from
us,
you
shouldn't
have
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
you
know,
end
of
problem
as
far
as
this
argument
is
concerned.
now,
maybe
they
should
have
made
their
protest
earlier,
but
i
don't
see
that
this
is
a
tort
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
when
you
said
it
has
no
remedial
aspect
to
it.
you
mean
you
think
it
could
be
disregarded
by
the
states
at
will
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--nothing
would
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
there
be
such
diametric
opposition
on
such
a
fundamental
point?
you
have
cases
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
you
provide
it,
please?
i'd
like
to
see
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
there
are
two
different
constitutional
violations
at
issue
here,
aren't
there?
one
is
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
and
i
take
that
to
be
referring
to
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
other
is
a
violation
of
the
takings
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
in
not
giving
you
your
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
they're
saying
you
didn't
make
that
claim
until
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
quite
fair.
what
has
to
be
clear
and
certain
is
the
availability
of
the
predeprivation
remedy,
not
the
non-availability
of
the
post-deprivation
remedy.
