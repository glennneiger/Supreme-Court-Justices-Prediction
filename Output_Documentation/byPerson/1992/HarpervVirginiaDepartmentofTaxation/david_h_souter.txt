justice
david
h.

mr.
kator,
i
think
you
said
that
the
commissioner
cannot
relieve
you
of
your
tax
liability
on
grounds
of
unconstitutionality.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
can't
forgive
it.
can
he
make
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
and
then
say
well,
i'm
terribly
sorry,
i
can't
let
you
go
but
i
admit
that
the
tax
is
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
cannot
make
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
with
any
legally
operative
significance,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
marshall,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
moment
before
you
get
into
that?
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
something
you
said
before.
i
guess
i
have
two
questions.
the
first
is
with
respect
to
the
declaratory
judgment
remedy.
is
that
set
out
as
a
peculiar
or
a
particular
ailment
of
the
tax
refund
procedure
or
is
there
simply
a
general
statute
in
virginia
providing
for
declaratory
judgment
remedies?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
thank
you.
now,
my
second
question
goes
to
your
statement
that
the
commissioner
could
forgive
the
tax
but
could
not
declare
it
unconstitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
be,
and
i
certainly
will
accept
your
answer
on
that
point,
but
isn't
it
clear
that
unless
he
is
able
to
declare
the
tax
unconstitutional
he
could
not,
as
you
put
it,
exonerate
them
on
the
kind
of
claim
that
we
have
before
us
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
sure
he
has
that
general
power
but
isn't
it
equally
clear
that
he
could
not
legally
use
that
power
without
stating
a
legally
sufficient
reason?
in
fact
we've
been
saying
unconstitutional,
i
guess
it's
really
a
supremacy
clause
issue
here,
if
there's
a
difference.
unless
he
could
say
yes,
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
i
may
not
collect
this
tax
given
the
federal
statute,
then
he
couldn't
exonerate
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
he
had
gone
to
the
commissioner
first,
not
declaratory
judgment
first
but
if
he
had
gone
to
the
commissioner
first
could
he
then
have
sought
judicial
review
without
payment
of
the
tax?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
marshall,
you
have
made
a
statement
that
i
don't
understand.
why
have
they
placed
all
their
eggs
in
the
basket
of
the
state
refund
remedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
marshall,
before
we
get
away
from
the
point,
in
case
it
should
make
a
difference
to
me
later,
can
you
tell
me
when
the
first,
when
the
point
was
either
as
a
matter
of
pleading
or
briefing,
when
your,
when
the
claimants
here
first
mentioned
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
basis
for
their
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
your
position
then
if
there
had
been
a
predeprivation
proceeding
brought,
either
administratively
in
the
first
place
or
by
declaratory
judgment,
it
would
have
been
appropriate
let's
say
in
the
latter
instance
for
the
court
to
say
you're
absolutely
right
that
you
should
not
be
assessed
this
tax,
but
the
only
obligation
virginia
has
now
is
to
change
its
law,
and
therefore
under
no
circumstances
can
you
get
a
penny
back
even
though
you
win
the
case.
would
that
have
been
an
appropriate
resolution?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
am
talking
about
not
minimums
but
maximums.
would
that
have
been
a
proper
application
of
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
now,
excuse
me,
i
don't
want
the
position
of
the
tax
department
as
such.
would
that
have
been
a
proper
application
of
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there
would
have
been
reliance
at
least
with
respect
to
the
period
for
the
tax
year
in
question.
they
would
have
budgeted
their,
they
would
have
passed
their
state
budget
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
going
to
get
this
money.
so
they
would
have
had
reliance.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
instance
in
which
i
gave
in
which
there
was
the
declaratory
judgment,
following
that
declaratory
judgment
the
commissioner
or
the
state
would
have
been
under
no
obligation
to
do
anything
but
go
ahead
and
collect
the
tax
merely
in
hopes
that
the
state
legislature
would
change
the
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
the
law--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
the
federal
statute
implies
something
other
than
prospective
changes
of
the
law
as
the
appropriate
form
of
relief,
which
i
think
is
the
proposition
you
were
disputing
a
moment
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
were
at
least
claiming
a
federal
right
here,
you
don't
dispute
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
based
on
a
refund
statute,
but
their
predicate
for
claiming
the
refund
was
the
claim
of
a
federal
right,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
we're
getting
anywhere.
