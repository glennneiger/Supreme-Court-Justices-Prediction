mr.
michael
j.
kator
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
cases
arises
as
the
sequel
to
davis
v.
michigan
department
of
the
treasury.
petitioners
are
federal
retirees
who,
relying
on
davis,
sought
refunds
of
the
taxes
virginia
unconstitutionally
imposed
on
their
pension.
the
court
below
denied
petitioners
their
refunds,
principally
holding
that
davis
was
not
to
be
applied
retroactively.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
davis
must
be
applied
retroactively,
and
if
so
whether
the
department
of
taxation
must
refund
petitioners
the
taxes
unconstitutionally
imposed
upon
them.
in
reaching
its
conclusion
to
apply
davis
nonretroactively,
the
court
below
relied
on
its
application
of
chevron
oil
v.
huson.
well,
we
submit
that
the
lower
court's
chevron
analysis
is
flawed
in
every
respect.
more
fundamentally
we
submit
that
the
court
below
erred
in
even
reaching
chevron.
foremost,
retroactivity
of
davis
is
compelled
by
this
court's
decision
in
beam
v.
georgia.
in
beam
this
court
rejected
modified
or
selective
prospectivity
in
the
civil
arena.
it
held
that
if
this
court
applies
its
rule
to
the
parties
before
it
in
one
case
all
other
courts
must
similarly
apply
that
rule
to
litigants
before
them.
thus
for
choice
of
law
purposes
the
dispositive
question
here
is
whether
the
court
applied
its
ruling
to
the
parties
in
davis.
on
this
point
there
can
be
no
real
dispute.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
holding
michigan
paid
and
paul
davis
received
a
refund
of
the
taxes
unconstitutionally
imposed
on
his
pension.
it
is
not
important
how
or
why
this
court
reached
that
determination.
it
matters
only
under
beam
that
it
did.
accordingly,
under
beam,
the
court
below
was
required
to
apply
davis
retroactively.
the
second
point
that
we
raise
is
our
statutory
point.
what
the
department
of
taxation
is
asking
the
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
something
that
it
has
never
done
before.
it
is
asking
the
court
to
use
chevron
to
ignore
the
plain,
unambiguous
terms
of
a
lawfully
enacted
act
of
congress.
this
is
not
anything
that
any
of
the
authorities
that
the
department
of
taxation
has
cited
in
its
brief
suggests
that
this
court
has
ever
done.
and
admitted,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there's
no
precedent
which
would
support
it.
in
enacting
the
public
salary
tax
act
in
1939
congress
said
taxes
imposed
after
december
31,
1938
must
be
non-discriminatory.
50
years
later
virginia
says
no,
that
statute
should
go
into
effect
december
31,
1988.
this
court
cannot
accept
virginia's
equitable
plea.
they
say
it's
going
to
be
very
burdensome
for
us
to
comply
with
the
statute.
congress
has
spoken,
and
that,
according
to
this
court's
precedent,
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
in
our
briefs
we
speak
at
great
detail
about
the
chevron
analysis.
we
address
the
bounds
and
propriety
of
prospectivity
and
we
address
the
application
of
chevron
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
this
court
has
most
recently
applied
chevron,
it
could
not
reach
a
case
such
as
this,
a
case
against
a
governmental
entity
where
there
is
no
contention
that
past
precedent
of
this
court
has
been
overruled
and
where
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
court
has
answered
a
novel
question
of
law
in
a
revolutionary
manner.
application
of
chevron
in
any
event
yields
retroactive
application
of
davis
as
each
element
of
that
analysis
favors
retroactivity.
for
these
reasons
as
well
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
that
davis
was
nonretroactive.
what
i
think
is
the
tricky
issue
in
this
case
is
not
so
much
the
choice
of
law
issue.
the
more
complicated
issue
is
the
remedy
issue.
the
court
below
offered
two
reasons
for
denying
petitioners'
refunds.
its
first
reason
was
that
under
chevron
davis
didn't
need
to
be
applied
retroactively.
and
that
i
submit
is
incorrect.
its
second
reason
was
that
under
its
own
state
law
analysis,
its
own
state
law
retroactivity
analysis,
davis
would
not
be
applied
retroactively.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
ashland
oil,
in
beam,
and
the
various
opinions
in
the
american
trucking
association
v.
smith,
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
a
decision
of
this
court
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
not
state
law.
the
virginia
supreme
court
was
simply
wrong
in
holding
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
you
could
deny
retroactive
effect
to
davis.
the
second
thing
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
did
in
its
second
opinion
was
it
suggested
that
no
remedy
was
required
here
even
if
davis
is
retroactive
because
it
can
continue
to
consider
the
remedial,
or
the
equitable
considerations
of
chevron
in
the
remedial
calculus.
it
can
say
even
if
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
declared
by
davis,
nonetheless
it
can
deny
relief.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
certainly
a
state
can
structure
its
tax
refund
statute
in
a
way
that
provides
it
protection.
certainly.
that's
not
what
we
have
here
in
this
case.
the
bottom
line,
as
mckesson
makes
clear,
is
a
clear
and
certain
remedy
for
the
unlawful
deprivation
of
property.
that's
what
we
had
in
this
case.
virginia
seems
to
suggest
that
mckesson
only
applies
in
the
situation
where
it's
foreseeable
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
enacted
that
the
statute
would
be
challenged
and
likely
invalidated.
and
i
submit
that
mckesson
cannot
be
so
limited.
mckesson
speaks
in
terms
of
constitutional
due
process.
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
say
you
get
due,
due
process
may
not
be
taken
in
bad
faith
without
due
process
of
law.
it
says
property
may
not
be
taken
without
due
process
of
law.
their
reading
of
mckesson
is
far
too
parsimonious.
in
this
case
virginia
must
provide
a
clear
and
certain
remedy,
and
their
statute
presumably
does
so.
if
it
doesn't,
then
the
constitution
requires
that
a
remedy
be
provided.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
certainly.
as
this
court
held
in
beam
and
in
mckesson,
the
states
are
allowed
to
erect
procedural
barriers,
procedural
protections
around
them
to
shield
them
from
liability.
and
that's
what
most
states
have
done.
they
have
created
a
system
whereby
the
statute
of
limitations,
3
years,
whatever,
within
which
to
present
claims,
and
that's
the
procedure
the
petitioners
have
followed
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
in
an
ordinary
case
it
would
be
3
years
as
a
general
rule.
it's
3
years
or
i
believe
60
days
after
your
federal
return
is
corrected
in
a
federal
claim,
piggy-backs
it
in
that
sense.
in
this
particular
case,
shortly
after
davis
was
decided
by
this
court
the
virginia
legislature
met
and
amended
its
refund
statute
for
the
explicit
purpose
of
allowing
federal,
the
claims
of
federal,
retroactivity
of
davis
to
be
resolved,
it
amended
the
refund
statute
to
say
claims
for
refunds
for
davis
type
taxes
may
be
submitted
up
to
a
year
after
final
resolution
of
the
retroactivity
of
davis.
so
in
virginia
the
door
is
still
open.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
well,
perhaps
this
court,
perhaps
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
on
remand.
it's
a
little
unclear,
but
the
door
is
still
open
in
virginia.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
only
to
1984
would
be
the
first...
i'm
sorry,
1985
would
be
the
first
tax
year
at
issue,
in
dispute
in
this
case.
most
of
the
petitioners
filed
their
refund
claims
in
march,
april
of
1989,
and
that
would
have
entitled
them
to
go
back
to
1985.
so
the
tax
years
in
dispute
are
'85,
'86,
'87,
and
'88.
virginia
didn't
impose
the
tax
in
'89.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
in
this
case
all
the
court
has
held
is
that
the
reason
its
refund
statute
does
not
apply
is
because
of
non-retroactivity
of
davis.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
in
its
second
opinion
it
intimated
that
it
could
continue
to
play
the
chevron
game
with
respect
to
a
remedy,
but
that's
not
anything
that
it
had
done
before.
we
also
challenge
the
assertion
that
there's
any
meaningful
predeprivation
remedy
in
virginia.
in
virginia
the
predeprivation
remedy
is
essentially
to
go
to
the
tax
commissioner
and
say
i
don't
think
i
should
have
to
pay
these
taxes.
in
order
to
get
judicial
review
of
that
determination
by
the
tax
commissioner
you
must
pay
the
taxes
and
you
are
funnelled
into
the
same
refund
procedure
that
we
filed,
the
petitioners
filed
in
this
case.
so
because
this
case
involves
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
statute,
the
virginia
tax
commissioner
has
no
authority
to
say
the
tax
is
unconstitutional
to
absolve
petitioners
from
paying
that
tax.
therefore
there
is
no
meaningful
predeprivation
remedy.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
no.
and
that's
the
second
point,
your
honor.
virginia
doesn't
require
that
you
choose
any
one
particular
route.
it
has
various
routes.
and
what
the
argument
seems
to
be
is
that
well,
you
had
this
other
route
you
could
have
taken
and
therefore
we
can
cut
off
the
route
that
you
happened
to
choose
to
take.
and
i
submit
that
that
would
violate
fundamental
notions
of
due
process
as
in
the
brinkerhoff-faris
case.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
you
had
to
pay
the
tax
first.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
virginia
does
have
a
procedure
whereby
you
can
preserve
a
refund
claim
in
just
that
manner.
but
the
fact
remains
that
in
terms
of
getting
an
unconstitutional
tax
refunded
it
can't
be
done
unless
you
go
to
court,
and
you
can't
go
to
court
unless
you
pay
the
tax.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
yes,
it
would
extend
your
statute
of
limitations.
it
doesn't
allow
you
to
go
back
any
further,
but
it
would
extend
the
time
that
you
could
finally
file
suit.
but
i
don't
see
that
that
would
necessarily
reflect
on
the
meaningfulness
of
the
predeprivation
remedy
because
the
bottom
line
still
remains
unless
you
go
to
court
you
can't
get
your
money
back,
and
unless
you
pay
your
taxes
you
can't
go
to
court.
and
that
is
what
i
see
as
the
central
component
of
the
predeprivation
remedy
that's
required.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
i
don't...
i
suspect
it's
conceivable
that
he
could
say
i'm
very
sympathetic,
i
think
this
tax
is
unconstitutional
but
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it,
but
i
know--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--exactly.
not
in
virginia,
not
in
the
united
states,
and
not
in
any
jurisdiction
that
i'm
familiar
with.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
the
argument
that
i
understand
the
department
of
taxation
to
make
is
that
the
state
has
its
own
retroactivity
analysis,
the
fountain
v.--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--well,
the
only
authority
they
cite
for
that
is
the
fountain
case
and
another
one
that
was
decided
on
or
about
the
same
date,
and
those
cases
are
retroactivity
cases.
and
they,
the
department,
the
attorney
general's
office
briefed
chevron
in
those
cases
and
the
court
came
down,
essentially
following
the
chevron
analysis
in
state
law
cases,
and
said
this
is
how
we
apply
it.
i
don't
understand
how
virginia
could
do
that,
but
that
comes
back
to
my,
to
the
bottom
line
of
our
brief
which
is
if
virginia
doesn't
provide
a
remedy,
then
the
constitution
must
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
takes
over.
petitioners
are
entitled
to
a
clear
and
certain
remedy
for
the
denial
of
their
property,
for
the
taking
of
their
property,
and
if
virginia's
statute
doesn't
provide
it
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
would.
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
important
point
that
comes
up
not
only
in
this
case
but
is
before
this
court
in
several
other
petitions
that
are
pending.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
because
if
it's
new
then
there
wasn't
a
clear
and
certain
remedy.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
you
have
a
brinkerhoff-faris
situation
where
they
undermined
your
claim,
your
existing
claim.
and
that's
what...
obviously
this
court
cannot
say
virginia's
refund
statute
provides
x.
that's
for
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
say.
but
what
this
court
can
say,
and
what
we
ask
it
to
say,
is
that
if
virginia's
refund
statute
doesn't
provide
a
remedy
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
does.
and
this
is
the
issue,
the
brinkerhoff-faris
issue
that
i
was
mentioning.
that's
before
the
court
in
the
norwest
bank
case
that's
on
petition.
it
is
also
before
the
case
in,
the
court
in
the
bass
case
which
is
pending.
recently
in
georgia
in
the,
not
in
the
beam
case
but
in
the
federal
retirees
case,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
yes,
davis
must
be
applied
retroactively
but
its
refund
statute
only
applies
to
illegal
taxes
collected
under
a
valid
statute
and
not
illegal
taxes
collected
under
an
invalid
statute.
and
therefore
in
georgia
they
tell
us,
notwithstanding
what
counsel
for
the
attorney,
for
georgia
told
this
court
in
beam,
that
the
only
way
to
recover
your
taxes
in
georgia
is
to
pay
them
under
protest.
this
is
the
kind
of,
these
are
the
kinds
of
defenses
that
are
coming
up
in
these
cases
now,
and
they're
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
i
wouldn't
say
that,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it...
well,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
okay.
let
me
start
with
a
case
that
i'm
more
familiar
with,
which
is
the
bass
case.
in
bass
the
supreme
court
said
yes,
you
must
pay
under
protest.
well,
the
pay
under
protest
provision
in
bass
had
previously
been
upheld
by
this
court
as
being
not
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy.
i
would
suggest
that
in
that
context
you
would
not
have,
that
would
not
be
an
adequate
remedy.
in,
as
a
general
rule,
yes.
that's
what
mckesson
stands
for,
that
you
can
impose
pay
under
protest.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
it
could
be,
your
honor,
if
it
were
imposed
in
the
future.
if
you
try
to
impose
it
retroactively,
you
can't.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
i
think
that
that's
what
mckesson
holds,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
but
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
yes,
as
is
the
case
with
many
other
states.
there
are
various
ways
to
go
about
it.
petitioner
has
elected
this
route.
if
i
may
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
outset
let
me
clarify
the
issue
of
whether
virginia
has
a
declaratory
judgment
statute
that
would
reach
this
kind
of
claim.
they
don't.
in
fact
virginia
has
a
statute
in
its
books
that
states
that
you
may
not
file
a
declaratory
judgment
for
income
taxes,
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
case
law
that
says
you
may
not
do
so.
let
me
also
address
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
we
raised
a
federal
claim.
in
each--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--i
believe
we
did,
we
may
have
cited
the
cases
in
our
earlier
papers
in
this
court.
this
has
not
been
an
issue
until
this
morning.
but
my
recollection
from
3
years
ago
when
i
was
looking
at
this
is
yes,
indeed
virginia
has
a
statute,
it
says
you
may
not
file
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
i
am
certain
that
there
is
case
law,
for
one
of
the
things
that
we
thought
about
doing
was
trying
to
enjoin
the
imposition
of
the
1988
taxes,
which
were
not
due
until
may
1,
1989,
and
we
found
that
we
couldn't
do
it.
i
regret
that
i
don't
have
that
authority
in
front
of
me,
but
i
submit
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
find.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
i'd
be
delighted
to,
your
honor.
the
second
point
is
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
if
you
will.
in
each
of
our
complaints
in
this
case,
and
several
were
consolidated,
in
each
of
the
complaints
there
was
a
claim
that,
under
statement
of
claims
and
virginia
is
a
notice
pleading
state,
during
the
years
since
1985
plaintiffs
have
paid
excessive
taxes
which
have
been
unconstitutionally
and
illegally
exacted.
and
the
relief
requested
was
a
judgment
for
the
refund
of
all
unconstitutionally
assessed
and
collected
taxes.
i
don't
understand
how
virginia
can
state
that
there
is
no
constitutional
claim
alleged
in
these
papers.
there
certainly
is.
they
suggest
that
we
didn't
put
in
our
petition
our
points
of
error,
it's
called.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
i
think--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--to
be
fair,
your
honor,
we
didn't
contemplate
at
the
time
that
we
filed
our
complaint,
i
think
that
was
before
mckesson
came
down,
i
don't
believe
that
we
were
addressing
that.
but
we
moved
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
refund
statute.
if
we
have
to
go
back
and
move
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
constitution,
i
believe
it's
fairly
pled
within
the
complaint.
but
the
points
of
error,
the
circuit
court
for
alexandria,
where
this
case
came
from,
issued
its
opinion,
and
that's
the
opinion
we
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
solely
on
retroactivity
of
davis.
the
issue
that
is
raised
here
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
and
that
was
a
point
that
we
raised
in
our
reply
briefs.
we
said
why
are
you
raising
this
point
here.
and
the
reason
they
were
raising
that
point
there,
and
then
at
that
time,
was
because
that
was
after
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
in
its
bass
case
said
wait,
we've
got
a
better
idea.
we'll
change
our
refund
statute
and
say
it
doesn't
apply.
and
that's
exactly
what
virginia,
the
attorney
general
is
trying
to
convince
its
court
to
do,
and
to
its
credit
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
not
at
least
yet
gone
and
changed
its
refund
statute.
another
point
that
i
think
bears
emphasis,
if
it
were
so
clear
and
certain
that
petitioners
had
no
remedy
under
the
refund
statute,
why
did
the
virginia
general
assembly
amend
the
statute
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
for
petitioners
to
file
their
claims
solely
and
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
retroactivity
of
davis
to
be
resolved?
certainly
the
legislature
of
virginia
thought
the
refund
statute
applied,
and
perhaps
in
retrospect
maybe
virginia
is
right,
it
didn't
apply
it.
but
it
must
now
because
the
supreme,
the
legislature
of
virginia
has
amended
it
to
say
so.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
perkins
and
capehart,
your
honor,
first
of
all
those
are
what
we
would
call
modified
prospectivity
cases.
in
both...
in
perkins
the
taxpayer
said
your
particular
method
of
assessment
is
unconstitutional,
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
you
are
right,
we'll
give
you
the
remedy
that
you've
asked
for,
and
in
capehart...
but
we're
going
to
apply
that
prospectively
only.
and
then
in
capehart,
when
somebody
else
in
another
county
tried
to
do
it,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
no,
we
said
in
perkins
prospective
only
and
that's
what
we
meant.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
this
case,
and
this
is
at
15(a)
of
the
cert
petition,
says
harper's
state
law
contention
also
fails
for
another
reason.
we
previously
have
held
that
this
court's
ruling
declaring
a
taxing
scheme
unconstitutional
is
to
be
applied
prospectively
only.
this
is
virginia's
state
law
prospectivity
doctrine,
and
it's
simply
inapposite
in
a
federal
question,
in
a
case
involving
federal
retroactivity.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
an
accurate
statement
of
mckesson,
that
if
in
fact
they
have
a
full
predeprivation
remedy
they
can
have
no
post-deprivation
remedy.
but
the
critical
point
here
is,
what
mckesson's
requirement
is
is
a
clear
and
certain
remedy.
and
it
was
anything
but
clear
and
certain,
even
after
this
morning
i
submit,
that
virginia's
post-deprivation
remedy
doesn't
apply
to
this.
if
virginia
wants
to
change
its
rules
and
say
that
its
post-deprivation
statute
doesn't
apply,
and
there
are
people
who
have
obtained
refunds
of
unconstitutional
taxes
under
that
statute--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
what
must
be
clear
and
certain
is
the
bundle
of
routes
available
to
challenge
the
tax.
and
this
brings
us
back
into
brinkerhoff-faris.
they
simply
can't
say
you
have
two
statutes,
two
means
to
challenge
it
available
to
you,
both
adequate.
one
is
an
adequate
predeprivation
remedy
which...
don't
misunderstand
me.
we
dispute
that
there
is
an
adequate
predeprivation
remedy.
but
they
can't
say
you've
got
two
routes
and
therefore
since
you
have
two
we're
going
to
cut
one
off.
that
is
unconstitutional.
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits.
and
that
is
what
i
believe
virginia
is
arguing
that
its
court
should
do.
i
don't
think
that
it's
arguing--
mr.
michael
j.
kator
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
can
fairly
be
read
from
the
supreme
court's
opinion.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
okay.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
correct,
your
honor,
and
my
point
is
i
don't
think
that
it
is,
it
can
be
seen
from
that.
i
think
it
also
bears
emphasis
that
when
this
case
was
originally
brought
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
the
virginia
attorney
general
pled
the
existence
of
the
refund
statute
as
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy.
and
i
don't
think
the
significance
of
that
should
be
lost
on
the
court.
the
bottom
line
as
we
see
it,
your
honor,
is
mckesson's
requirement
for
a
clear
and
certain
remedy.
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
dispute
that
davis
must
be
applied
retroactively.
that
being
so,
there
must
be
a
clear
and
certain
remedy.
what
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
no
more
than
say
that
it
meant
what
it
said
in
davis,
that
it
meant
what
it
said
in
beam,
and
that
it
meant
what
it
said
in
mckesson,
and
on
that
basis
to
reverse
the
decision
below.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
the
argument
was,
my
argument
was
your
refund
statute
says
erroneous
and
illegal.
that's
the
legislature's
conclusion
of
how
it
wants
to
gauge
this,
and
therefore
you
can't
play
the
retroactivity
game.
this
is
essentially
the
argument
that
was
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
in
hackman.
in
rejecting
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
no,
the
retroactivity
of
davis
comes
first
and
therefore,
because
we
find
that
davis
is
not
retroactive,
it's
not
erroneous
or
illegal.
and
moreover,
just
so
you
know,
we
have
done
this
before.
that's
essentially
what
their
state
law
holding
was.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
michael
j.
kator
thank
you.
