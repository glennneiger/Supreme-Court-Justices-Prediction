ms.
gail
starling
marshall
let
me
begin
with
that.
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
the
predeprivation
remedy
that
virginia
has
is
not
limited
just
to
the
administrative
proceeding
here,
administrating
proceeding
that
admittedly
none
of
these
petitioners
came
forward
in.
it
is
also
involves
predeprivation
possibility
of
going
to
court
in
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
actually
the
perkins
case,
which
we
cited
to
this
court,
is
in
fact
a
declaratory
judgment
case.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
there
are
various
predeprivation
remedies.
they
are
set
forth
in
our
supplemental
appendix.
they
include
not
only
the
administrative
procedure
which
has
been
addressed
here
to
the
tax
commissioner,
and
i
disagree
with
what
was
stated
earlier.
the
tax
commissioner
can
exonerate
a
taxpayer
from
payment.
he
may
not
be
able
to
declare
anything
unconstitutional,
but
he
certainly
can
give
a
taxpayer
relief.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
mr.
justice
scalia,
the
state
gives
them
an
option
under
the
regulations--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--which
are
part
of
our
submission
in
our
brief.
the
regulations
actually
encourage
people
to
use
the
predeprivation
remedies.
what
i
suggest
to
this
court
is
that
the
predeprivation
remedy
or
the
remedy
that
this,
these
petitioners
choose,
and
they
chose
a
post-deprivation
remedy,
when
they
choose
that,
which
was
an
option
they
have,
they
take
that
remedy
as
it
is
in
state
law.
and
that
remedy
is
not
a
mandatory
refund
remedy
in
facts
of
this
nature.
for
2
decades
there
has
been--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--there
is
a
general
statute
and
it
is
applied.
we
do
not,
in
other
words
our
tax
exemption
or
injunction
statute
does
not
bar
that.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
perkins
itself,
the
case
that
our
supreme
court
relied
on
in
forming
and
declaring
the
nature
of
the
refund
remedy,
which
the
option
that
these
petitioners
took,
relied
on
the
perkins
case
and
it
itself
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
well,
whether
he
could
or
not,
that
hasn't
been
litigated
in
virginia,
but
the
point
is
whether
these
petitioners
could
have
gotten
relief
and
they
certainly
could
have
gotten
relief.
he
has
the
authority
to
exonerate
the
taxpayer
and
the
limitations
of
the
kinds
of
reasons
you
can
argue
to
the
commissioner
is
unlimited
for
why
you
should
be
exonerated.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
no,
i
disagree.
the
regulations
in
the
statute,
it's
section
1821
of
the
code,
specifically
state
that
he
can
compromise
the
claim,
he
can
foreclose
or
not
have
any
collection
action
or
assessment
action--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--well,
i
mean,
he
is
subject,
of
course,
to
writs
of
prohibition
and
mandamus
for
arbitrary
actions,
but,
and
certainly
he
is
presumed
to
act
in,
presumptively
to
act
in
good
faith
reliance
on
what
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
law
is.
but
he
does
have
the
authority
to
exonerate.
if
the
petitioner,
for
example,
had
done
that
and
had
lost
that
case
he
could
then
have
brought
it
to
a
judicial
body,
a
declaratory
judgment
prior
to
paying
the
tax.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
as
a
declaratory
judgment,
that's
correct.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
that's
correct.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
yes.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
your
honor,
that
case
has
never
come
before
the
court.
in
other
words--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--that's...
well,
i'm
sorry--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--could
i--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--i
wanted
to
say
that
the
question
of
what
would
have
occurred
had
they
taken
any
of
these
other
remedies
has
not
been
litigated
in
the
virginia
court.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
perkins
and
capehart,
the
two
cases
in
the
1970s,
give
notice
to
the
petitioners
that
if
they
choose
this
particular
remedy,
which
is
one
of
several
available
remedies,
it
comes
with
that
limitation,
the
limitation
which
has
been
engrafted
on
the
law
by
our
supreme
court
2
decades
ago.
and
i
suggest
that
is
notice
to
petitioners--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--it
comes
with
the
statutory
interpretation
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
perkins
and
capehart
that
in
cases
where
there
is
reliance
by
all
parties
on
the
law
and
there
would
be
a
failure
of
the
administration
of
justice
for
that
to
be
overturned--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--that
the
remedy
of
refund
is
not
mandatory.
the
1826,
the
part
of
our
code
1826
is
not
mandatory.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
at
the
trial
court.
the
perkins
and
capehart
cases--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--we
have
argued
all
the
way
through.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
are
two
things
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
address,
and
there
are
various
lens
that
this
court
can
look
at
the
case.
if
i
may
suggest,
for
example,
this
court
could
find
that
davis
is
prospective,
and
if
it
finds
that
for
whatever
reason
this
case
is
over
because
there
are
no
other
legal
issues
for
the
court
to
address.
if,
however,
this
court
finds
that
it
is
not
prospective,
we
submit
that
you
could
still
and
should
still
affirm
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
below
because
the
virginia
supreme
court
not
only
determined
under
chevron
that
it
was
prospective
and
therefore
not
an
erroneous
or
improper
exaction
of
tax,
which
is
what
1826
requires,
but
it
also
had
another
leg
to
its
opinion
in
which
it
said
that
under
1826
and
under
our
precedents,
perkins
and
capehart,
we
look
in
those
cases
to
the
reliance
of
the
parties
and
the
factors
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
determining
whether
or
not
our
particular
statutory
state
remedy
encompasses
the
facts
that
you
petitioners
have
chosen
to
bring
before
us
and
that
you
have,
the
route
you
have
chosen
to
take.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
let
me
suggest,
your
honor,
that
i
believe
it
is
clearly
derived
from
perkins.
perkins
was
a
prepayment
case.
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
it
received
the
relief
of
the
court
from
what
was
determined
to
be
an
erroneous
assessment
methodology
used
by,
widespread.
similar
here
where
this
is
used
in
23
states,
that
was
used
in
many
counties.
capehart
came
later.
capehart
paid
the
tax
and
then
asked
for
the
refund,
and
capehart's
refund
claim
was
denied.
so
i
suggest
that
the
prepayment/post-payment
is
really
intrinsically
in
those
two
cases.
but
whether
you
say
have
we
litigated
a
lot
of
cases
in
that
area,
no,
your
honor,
we
have
not.
but
i
suggest
to
your
honor
for
several
reasons
that
whether
you
find
davis
to
be
retroactive
or
not,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
should
be
affirmed
because
what
virginia
has
done
in
the
second
part
of
its
opinion
is
it
looked
to
its
state
law
remedy
and
it
has
defined
the
scope
even-handedly
and
based
on
precedent
that
is
2
decades
old.
it
has
defined
the
scope
of
that
remedy.
and
only,
i
would
suggest,
if
this
court
finds
that
there
is
not,
as
we
argue
there
is,
a
procedural
bar
to
these
further
federal
constitutional
questions
such
as
due
process,
only
if
you
find
that
that
procedural
bar
does
not
exist
in
this
case
would
you
be
correct
in
remanding
this
for
the
court
below
to
consider
those
due
process
issues.
petitioners
have
argued
that
the
due
process
issues
were
argued
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
their
reply
brief
at
the
supreme
court
stage,
but
we
argue
there
is
a
state
procedural
bar
and
certainly
putting
it
in
your
reply
brief
is
not
a
proper
way
of
preserving
the
point.
the
assignments
of
error
under
virginia
law
clearly
state
what
issues
are
waived
and
which
ones
are
not
waived.
speaking
of
mckesson,
i'd
like
to
mention
also
that
in
mckesson
not
only
did
they
violate
clearly
established
law
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
and
the
collection
of
the
tax,
but
they
protested
the
tax
ahead
of
time,
as
these
people
had
the
option
to
do,
not
the
requirement
to
do
but
the
option
to
do.
these
people
never
came
forward
and
raised
their
hand.
also
in
mckesson,
their
complaint
was
based
on
two
alternative
grounds
or
theories
of
recovery,
state
law
refund
and
directly
on
the
constitution.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
these
petitioners
have
chosen
to
put
all
of
their
eggs
into
one
basket,
and
that
is
into
the
basket
of
the
state
refund
act.
and
we
submit
that
that
state
remedy
simply
does
not
exist
for
them
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
when
you
look
at
their
complaints,
which
we
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
the
only
use
they
make
of
section
111
or
the
federal
law
is
to
establish
or
try
to
bootstrap
themselves
into
the
state
refund
statute.
in
other
words
they
did
not
bring
a
claim
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
did
not
bring
a
claim
on
due
process.
there
is
no
federal
grounded
claim
that
they
have
brought
in
their
complaint.
moreover,
when
they
went--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--well,
in
mckesson,
mckesson
brought
its
claim
both
on
federal
grounds
and
on
state
grounds,
and
they
suggest
here,
and
even
in
the
supreme
court,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
the
assignments
of
error
decide
what
is
waived
and
what
is
put
forward,
and
yet
in
assignments
of
error
they
make
no
claim
of
unconstitutionality
or
due
process
problems
with
the
remedial
face
of
the
case.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
but,
your
honor,
when
they
brought
the
claim
they
surely
knew
of
perkins
and
capehart.
they
knew
it
was
not
a
mandatory
remedy
and
that
it
had
certain
limitations
which
we
do
suggest
are
similar
to
the
policies
behind
the
statute
of
limitations
in
repose
to
protect
the
reliance
interest.
and
if
there's
anything
this
case
really
is
about,
it
is
about
settled
expectations
and
reliance
interest.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
when
this
case
came
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
the
claim
had
been
denied.
the
commonwealth
was
granted
summary
judgment
by
the
trial
court.
if
there
was
any
question
at
that
time
that
virginia's
procedural
scheme
had
any
further
federal
constitutional
grounds,
then
certainly
at
that
time
it
should
have
been
presented
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
again,
your
honor--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--your
honor,
that
is
a
possible
way
of
reading
the
case
below.
i
believe
another
way
of
reading
it
is
that
it
had
an
independent
ground
which
said
regardless
of
the
federal
retroactivity
we
have
to
look
at
how
our
state
statute
and
remedy
that
these
petitioners
have
chosen
to
pursue
is
written
and
how
it
should,
and
how
it
has
been
applied
in
our
courts.
now,
if
there
is
a
feeling
in
this
court
that
that
is
not
clear
in
the
decision
below
it
would
certainly
be
an
appropriate
disposition
to
remand
it
for
consideration
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
my
view
had
two
grounds
for
its
state
law
rule.
one
is
it
was
dependent
on
federal
law.
that
said
it
followed,
if
it's
not
retroactive
it's
not
erroneous.
but
it
went
on
to
say
there
are
other
reasons
why,
citing
these
1971
cases,
why
our
particular,
the
particular
remedy
you
have
chosen
simply
is
not
one
that
is
available
to
you
on
these
facts.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
i
believe
it
was
in
this
court.
they
state
in
their
brief
in
this
court
that
well,
if
the
statute
does
not
give
us,
the
refund
statute
does
not
give
us
relief
we
have
relief
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
if
you
look
at
the
assignments
of
error
it's
very
clear
there
were
two
issues
they
presented
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
your
statute
clearly
on
its
face
requires
that
you
give
us
a
refund,
and
you
have
wrongly
applied
chevron
below.
those
were
the
two
issues
that
were
presented.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
it's
very
important
for
the
court,
whatever
lens
it
sees
this
case
through,
to
focus
on
and
to
look
at
the
reliance
interest
and
the
settled
expectations
of
the
parties.
it's
also
important
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
harm
alleged.
what
is
it
that
virginia
is
supposed
to
have
done
that
was
offensive
to
federal
law?
this
is
not
a
case,
we
suggest,
where
there
was
any
over-reaching.
virginia
was
not
pushing
the
envelope
in
any
way
of
valid
taxation.
it
turned
out
that
it
was
in
fatal
collision,
unknown
to
it
and
unknown
to
these
petitioners
who
never
came
forward
and
raised
their
hands
and
said
there
was
a
problem
until
after
this
court's
decision
in
march
of
1989.
but
it
was
certainly
reasonable
both
for
the
petitioners
and
the
23
states
who
have,
as
you
know,
a
massive
refund
liability
on
this
case
of
approximately
$1.8
billion,
it
was
reasonable
for
those
states
to
believe
that
they
had
a
legitimate
purpose
to
give
benefits
to
their
own
former
state
retirees,
former
state
employees.
this
was
a
legitimate
purpose
and
the
fact
that
they
had
done
it
through
an
indirect
benefit
of
taxes
rather
than
through
a
direct
cash
benefit
did
not
appear,
and
reasonably
so,
to
be
of
any
legal
significance.
what
virginia
did
was
it
exempted
its
state
retirees,
there
are
approximately
60,000
of
those
today.
then
it
taxed
the
entire
individual
taxpaying
public
identically,
$2.56
million.
fewer
than
10
percent
of
that
are
represented
by
the
federal
retirees
here.
in
other
words
virginia's
state
retirees
are
outnumbered
by
citizens
and
voters
who
are
federal
retirees
by
about
3
to
1.
when
you
look
at
that
number
and
you
also
consider,
which
is
in
the
record
and
the
affidavit
and
the
legislative
history,
the
disparity
between
the
general
size
of
federal
retirement
income
and
the
size
of
state
retirement
income
you
can
do
a
rough
estimate
of
what
the
value
was
of
the
benefit
now
found
to
be
offending
under
davis,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
quickly
changed
our
law
immediately
to
conform
with
davis.
but
that
value
of
the
benefit
given
during
the
4
years
in
issue
here
is
approximately
$8
million
to
$12
million.
now
we
suggest
that
the
penalty
here
that
is
being
requested
or
demanded
of
a
100
percent
refund,
which
for
virginia
alone
now
is
approximately
$467
million,
that
no
federal
interest
requires
that.
there
is
no
federal
interest
or
underpinning
in
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
that
would
lead
to
that
inequitable
result.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
well,
as
you
know,
this
was
based
principally
on
the
statute,
and
it
was
interpreted
to
be
simply
federal
retirees
versus
state.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
yes.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
that's
right.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
oh,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
an
equal
protection
claim
and
i
think
that
you
would
look
to,
if
you
were
looking
under
a
federal
rule,
you
would
look
to
all
of
the
points
which
this
court
has
established
as
a
very
workable
and
fair
rule
in
chevron.
was
it
a
new
principle
of
law?
did
everyone
rely
on
its
being...
i
believe
for
example--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--i
think
that
goes
to,
your
honor,
to
the
foreseeability
of
it
and
the
reliance
interest.
even
this
court
under
title
vii
has
found
it's
not--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--well,
your
honor,
we
had
a
very
courtly
dissent
in
that
case,
as
you
know,
and
we
suggest
that
what
was
unforeseeable
to
the
states...
if
it
was
foreseeable
we
wonder
why
did
not
any
one
of
these
petitioners
come
forward
and,
as
they
can,
it
doesn't
cost
any
money,
come
forward
and
ask
for
a
legal
opinion
by
the
highest
legal
officer
of
the
state.
if
it
was
so
foreseeable
at
least
since
1961,
for
example,
or
since
mccullough,
why
did
not
a
single
petitioner,
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
over
the
country
who
are
in
the
same
boat,
they
had
every
economic
interest
to
come
forward
not
only
for
a
refund
but
taxpayers
always
have
motivations
to
come
forward
to
exonerate
themselves
from
ongoing
law.
no
one
came
forward.
no
one
even--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--i
don't
say
that
they
were
behaving
unreasonably.
nor
was
the
state,
your
honor,
behaving
unreasonably.
we
all
found
davis
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
legal
edifice
out
there
that
cast
its
shadow
in
the
direction
of
davis.
we
found
that
that
was
a
surprise,
the
discrimination
of
a
general
tax
doing
a
legitimate
government
purpose
to
benefit
state
retirees,
the
fact
that
that
was
somehow
discrimination
was
a
surprise
to
all
of
us.
we
accept
that
now,
but
we
also
believe,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
personal
compensable
rights
that
these
petitioners
have
suffered.
i
suggested
to
you,
for
example,
that
there
were
2.5
million
taxpayers,
and
that
the
rough
estimate
of
this
now
found
to
be
offending
benefit
that
the
state
gave
to
its
own
retirees
was
approximately
$12
million
a
year.
that
comes
to
$5
per
taxpayer
per
year.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
pardon?
your
honor,
they
have
never
asked
for
that
refund.
they
have
asked
for
100
percent
refund,
despite
the
fact
that
the
refund
is
10
times
the
amount
of
the
offending
benefit
and
despite
the
fact
that
they,
as
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
2.5
million,
they
did
not
fund
the
vast
majority
of
this.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
discrimination
based
on
the
federal
government,
but
that
has
been
decided
in
davis.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
and
what
they're
asking
for
is
roughly
10
times
the
amount
of
what
was
now
found
to
be
the
offending
benefit
that
was
given,
and
it
was
not
funded
by
these
200,000
people.
it
was
funded
by
the
entire
taxpaying
public
and
corporate
taxpayers
who
are
amici
here.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
this
is
a
rough
estimate
based,
your
honor,
on
the
fact
that
there
were
very
many
fewer,
there
were
very
many
fewer
state
retirees
in
virginia.
virginia
state
retirees
are
about
60,000.
federal
retirees
are
about
200,000.
in
the
record
is
also
a
differential
of,
for
example
in
1982
the
average
federal
retiree
in
virginia
got
$15,000
in
income
and
the
average
state
retiree
got
less
than
$5,000.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
they
are
asking
for
100
percent
tax
exemption,
and
certainly
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
never
entitled
them
to
an
exemption.
they
have
no
personal
harm
which
is
really
being
redressed
here.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
federal
interest
that
is
being
advanced
by
what
really
amounts
to
taking
from
these
2.5
million
taxpayers
a
massive
amount
of
what
would
otherwise
be
state
assets
available
for
construction
of
prisons
and
various
services
and
transferring
it
to
these
200,000
people.
whatever
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
purpose
was,
i
don't
believe
it
was
to
give
a
personal
benefit,
unlike
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
sex
discrimination
clause,
where
the
purpose,
the
federal
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
even
in
commerce
clause,
is
to
give
a
personal
benefit
to
an
individual.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
your
honor,
the
statute--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--but,
your
honor,
let's
go
back
to
what
is
the
remedial
question.
one
thing
that's
very
clear
is
that
the
plain
language
of
section
111
says
nothing
about
remedy.
it
has
no
hint
that
it
was
intended
to
have
any
remedial
prospect.
that
therefore
we
contend
is
not,
and
it's
not
what
they
base
their
claim
on.
they
base
their
claim
on
1826
of
the
virginia
code.
we
suggest
to
your
honor
that--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
and
it
was
not.
once
it
was
declared
in
davis
that
there
was
an
unexpected,
and
i
think
as
j.
harvey
wilkinson,
judge
wilkinson
said
in
the
fourth
circuit,
a
totally
unexpected
collision
between
these
federal
statutes
and
what
was
thought
to
be
a
benign
and
modest
state
benefit,
once
that
was
determined
virginia
changed
its
law
immediately.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
doctrine
requires
no
more
than
that
prospective
change.
this
court
has
cited
recently
justice
harlan
in
the
state
of
donnelly
case.
sometimes
at
the
remedial
phase
recision
is
all
that's
required,
not
money
damages.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
at
a
minimum
you
would
certainly
change
the
law,
and
that
was
appropriately
done.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
it's
a
position
of
the
tax
department
that
we
would
be
in
a
totally--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--i
do
not
believe
so
because
there
would
have
been
no
reliance
then
by
the
state.
in
other
words
they
would
have
been
put
on
notice
that
a
sum
certain
was
under
a
cloud
or
a
challenge
of
invalidity.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
in
a
declaratory
judgment
though
we're
talking
about
a
prepayment
remedy.
what
the
declaratory
judgment
would
say
and
what
was
said
in
perkins
is
we
contend
that
this
money
that
we
have
not
yet
paid,
you
cannot
rely
on
that
because
we
are
putting
you
on
notice
that
that
money
is
under
a
claim
of
invalidity.
and
in
that
case
we
believe
the
equities
would
not
be
the
same,
that
there
would
have
been
a
refund
remedy
if
the
time
ran
and
they
had
to
pay
or
a
declaratory
judgment--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
after
the
declaratory
judgment
the
tax
collector,
the
tax
commissioner
would
be
obligated
to
follow
the
declaration
of
the
law
that
it
was
an
invalid
tax
and
to
withhold
exaction
or
collection
of
the
tax--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--and
to
refund.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
you
do
not
take
a
predeprivation
route
and
when
you
do
not
base
your
claim
for
remedy
directly
on
a
federal
right,
either
through
a
1983
or
through
any
other
injunctive
action...
for
example,
phillips
was
an
injunctive
action.
it
was
not
a
refund
case.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
they
were
not
basing
their
claim...
if
you
look
at
their
complaint
we
say
it
is
based
solely
on
a
refund
statute
which--
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
--your
honor,
they
used
the
davis
decision
in
order
to
try
to
establish
that
the
plain
language
of
the
refund
remedy
statute
applied,
i.e.
that
it
was
improper
or
erroneous.
ms.
gail
starling
marshall
so,
your
honors,
i
would
suggest
that
as
a
result
of
the
law-changing
decision
that
this
court
made
in
march
of
1981
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
below.
