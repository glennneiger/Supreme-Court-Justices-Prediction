chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-794,
henry
harper
v.
virginia
department
of
taxation.
mr.
kator.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
certainly
the
state
can,
in
a
tax
case
the
state
can
require
a
claimant
to
go
through
the
procedures
required
of
other
claimants
for
tax
refunds,
can
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
i
suppose
the
state
can
also
put
a
time
bar
on
the
remedy,
that
you
must
apply
for
a
refund
or
pay
under
protest
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
or
you
can't
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
an
even-handedly
applied
requirement
that
you
pay
under
protest
in
order
to
recover
cannot
bar
recovery?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
the
general
rule,
why
is
the
general
rule
not
applicable,
could
it
not
be
applicable
to
this
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
virginia
had
in
1980,
say
before
all
of
this
litigation
arose,
adopted
a
rule
that
in
order
to
ever
get
a
refund
for
a
tax
you
have
to
have
paid
it
under
protest
and
applied
that
evenhandedly
up
until
now.
would
that
be
an
adequate
bar
to
recovery
here
to
someone
who
had
not
paid
under
protest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
is
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kator.
ms.
marshall,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
and
very
likely
to
some
of
my
colleagues
if
sometime
during
your
argument
you
would
describe
to
us
what
the
virginia
tax
recovery
provisions
are.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
procedure
also
involves
going
to
court.
is
that
an
alternative?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
do
one
or
the
other,
and
either
one
will
be
sufficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
then
it
won't
be
hard
to
refund
it
if
it's--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they're
asking
for
a
refund
that
is
disproportionate
to
the
amount
of
the
discrimination
that
was
imposed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
it's...
how
do
you
calculate
that
it's
10
times
the
amount
of
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
are
the
class
of
federal
retirees
asking
as
refunds
any
more
than
they
actually
paid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
virginia
i
suppose
has
the
choice
after
a
case
like
davis
to
say
that
we
will
withdraw
the
benefit
we
have
given
to
state
retirees
and
treat
everybody
equally.
but
if
you
don't
do
that
then
you've
got
to
treat
federal
retirees
like
state
retirees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
marshall.
mr.
kator,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
state
says,
and
now
they
may
be
right
or
wrong,
is
that
the
post-deprivation
remedy
is
more
limited
than
the
predeprivation
remedy,
and
that
so
long
as
the
predeprivation
remedy
is
full
they
are
not
required
to
give
you
a
full
post-deprivation
remedy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
virginia
is
arguing
that
its
court
has
done
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that,
but
i
just
thought
that
was
what
the
state
is
arguing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
that
they
should
do
it
now,
but
that
they
have
already
done
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kator.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
