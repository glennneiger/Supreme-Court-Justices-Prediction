but
how
far
back
does
that
go?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it,
or
maybe
it's
not
correct,
if
you
apply
to
the
commissioner
for
a
prepayment
remedy
would
that
extend
the
period
of
time
in
which
you
have
to
file
your
refund
because
the,
i
take
it
the
commissioner
can
hold
your
claim
in
abeyance
while
the
commissioner
is
determining
it,
and
then
if
the
commissioner
denies
it
i
take
it
the
refund
remedy,
the
limitation
of
the
refund
remedy
begins
to
run
from
either
the
denial
or
the
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
a
functional
difference
in
the
two
routes
in
that
if
you
apply
for
the
predeprivation,
for
the
prepayment
determination
it
is
going
to
have
the
effect
of
extending
the
period
of
time
in
which
you
have
to
ultimately
file
a
court
action.
