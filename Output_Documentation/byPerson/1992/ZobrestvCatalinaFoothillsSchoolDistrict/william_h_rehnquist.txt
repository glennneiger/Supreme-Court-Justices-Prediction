we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-94,
larry
zobrest
v.
the
catalina
foothills
school
district.
mr.
ball,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
school
district
ever
raise
any
objection
based
on
the
regulations
or
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ball.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
richardson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
only
reason
you
did
not
provide
it
to
him
at
a
private
was...
at
a
private
parochial
school,
as
opposed
to
another
private
school,
was
your
concern
about
the
establishment
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
there
be
that
sort
of
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you're
talking
about
a
difference
for
first
amendment
purposes?
if
they
loan
it
and
don't
undertake
to
repair
it,
it's
okay
under
the
first
amendment,
but
if
they
loan
it
and
undertake
to
maintain
it,
it's
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
first
amendment
turns
on
that
sort
of
fine
spun
distinction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
the
answer
is
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
it's
time
we
tried
to
straighten
out
some
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
want
to
be
careful.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richardson.
mr.
ball,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ball.
the
case
is
submitted.
