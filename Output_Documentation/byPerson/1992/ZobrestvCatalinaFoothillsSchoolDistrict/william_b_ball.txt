mr.
william
b.
ball
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
important
issue
posed
by
this
case
is
whether
jim
zobrest,
the
petitioner,
a
profoundly
deaf
boy,
would
have
to
have
forsaken
education
in
the
state-qualified
religious
school
of
his
parents'
conscientious
choice
if
he
were
to
participate
in
a
program
designed
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
aid
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children,
including
children
in
public
and
religious...
including
public
and
private
and
religious
schools.
now,
the
courts
below
answered
that
question
by
saying
yes,
and
that
is
the
respondent's
position
and
that
of
the
respondent's
amici.
now,
jim,
in
order
to
be
educated,
had
to
have
the
service
of
a
certified
sign
language
interpreter,
a
related
service
under
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act.
he
had
to
have
it
on
the
place
where
his
education
was
going
to
happen,
and
the
place
where
his
education
was
going
to
happen
was
salpointe
catholic
high
school,
a
high
school
which
meets
the
requirements
of
arizona's
compulsory
attendance
law
and
which
is
accredited
as
a
college
preparatory
school
by
the
north
central
association
of
colleges
and
schools.
but
it's
also
a
school
which
is
pervasively
religious,
and
on
the
ground,
the
sole
ground
that
to
afford
jim
a
sign
language
interpreter,
on
the
premises
of
a
pervasively
religious
school,
would
violate
the
establishment
clause,
the
court...
the
respondent
school
district
denied
him
the
service.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
find
any
authority
in
the
statute
for
the
school
district,
for
example,
to
have
paid
the
parents
money
so
they
could
go
and
hire
the
interpreter.
in
fact,
there
is
a...
under
section
1415...
the
subsection
i
can't
recall...
it
seems...
would
seem
to
preclude
that.
all
the
funds
therefore...
funds
therefore
could
not
be
disbursed
to
the
parents
for
that
purpose.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
have
never...
in
this
case
because
solely
the
federal
establishment
clause
was
raised,
we
have
not
in
any
way
gone
into
the
arizona
constitutional
question.
mr.
william
b.
ball
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
we
have
not
litigated
it
because,
in
fact,
the
process
had
already
gone
a
great
distance.
the
school
district
at
the--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--no,
justice
souter,
but
i
think
it's
important
that
i
add
there
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
parents
applied
for
eha
help
to
the
school
district,
the...
jim
was
already
enrolled
at
salpointe
catholic
high
school,
and
the
issuance
of
the
individualized
education
program
to
him
took
place
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
that's
where
he
was
and
that
the
sole
problem...
the
sole
problem...
and
this
appears
in
the
individualized
education
report
itself.
the
sole
problem
was
the
establishment
clause.
now,
the
key
issue,
as
we
see--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--yes.
the...
to
begin
with,
section
1415(a)--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--well,
they
don't
leave
the...
the
statute
doesn't
leave
it
open
to
the
state
to
decide
whether
private
school
children
will
be
included,
and
the
statute
also
provides
and
the
regulations
provide
that
there
will
be
provision
made
for
the
education
of
children
enrolled
in
all
private
schools.
and
the
regulations,
the...
under
30
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations...
specify
even
parochial
schools.
they
use
that
term,
and
the
only
question
then
is
where
and
under
what
circumstances
those
services
would
be
provided.
but
there
has
to
be
afforded
the
child
in
the
private
school,
including
a
parochial
school,
a
genuine
opportunity.
he
must
be
furnished
or
she
must
be
furnished
services
of
the
same
scope
and
quality
as
those
provided
for
public
school
children.
mr.
william
b.
ball
none
whatever.
their
sole...
chief
justice,
their
sole
objection
throughout
was
the
establishment
clause.
in
fact,
throughout
the
proceedings
before
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals,
they
insisted
that
jim
would
be
provided...
would
be
required
to
be
provided
the
services
by
them
on
the
premises
of
a
public
school
or
of
any...
any...
nonsectarian
private
school.
now,
the
key
issue,
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
the...
furnishing
of
an
interpreter
to
jim
would
have
had
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion.
we
are
regarding
the
entanglement
problem
raised
as
a
lesser
issue.
if
time
permits,
i
will
cover
that
or
if,
of
course,
i'm
asked.
the
respondent
give
three
reasons
why
they
believe
it
has
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion.
one
is
that
it
would
constitute
support
for
a
religious
institution.
i
think
we
can
dispose
of
that
rather
quickly.
salpointe
catholic
high
school
has
no
interest
in
the
case.
it
would
get
nothing
in
the
money...
in
the
way
of
money
or
materials
by
accommodating
and
taking
on
the
burden
of
accommodating
an
interpreter,
a
certified
sign
language
interpreter,
for
one
boy.
they
have
no
program.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no.
the
tuition
would
not
be
paid
for
at
all
by
the
school
district.
mr.
william
b.
ball
they
did,
indeed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
parents
will
pay
the
tuition
to
the
school
where
their
child
is
enrolled.
mr.
william
b.
ball
absolutely
so.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
then
he'd
have
to
give
up
the
religious
education.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
school
would
lose
that
amount
of
tuition--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--for
one
child.
mr.
william
b.
ball
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
not
significant.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
is
more
than
the
cost
of
the
interpreter,
but
here's
a
school
with
many
children.
this
is
one
interpreter
for
one
child.
we're
speaking
of
one
school,
and--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
they
had
no
program
for
the
deaf.
there's
no
real
market
to
bring
in
deaf
children.
sign
language
interpreters
who
are
certified
are
very,
very
scarce.
the
second
reason
which
the
respondent
attempts
to
advance
is
that
a
certified
sign
language
interpreter
will
inadvertently
or
intentionally
inculcate
religion
in
the
children.
here
i
think
the
respondents
totally
misconceives
what
certification
of
a
sign
language
interpreter
amounts
to.
under...
in
arizona,
an
interpreter
must
be
qualified
under
the
interpreter
quality
assurance
system.
he
is
a
member
of
the
registry,
the
national
registry
of
interpreters
for
the
deaf,
and
thus
is
bound
to
a
very
strict
code
as
to
what
the
interpreter's
function
is.
it's
simply
to
translate
american
sign
language
into
spoken
english,
spoken
english
into
american
sign
language,
and
that's
it.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
interpreter
is
indeed,
a...
the
window
of
communication
of
religion
in
the
schools.
he
will
be
conveying
religion.
no
doubt
about
it.
it's
a
given
in
the
case.
the
fact
that
he
does
that
does
not
put
him...
does
not
create
an
image
of
authority
to
him
in
any
sense
that
a
teacher
has.
he...
the
respondents
have
said
that
he
becomes
part
of
a
teaching
team
integrated,
as
you
were
saying,
into
the
teaching
apparatus
of
the
school.
in
fact,
he's
not
a
member
of...
if
he's
a
member
of
the
team,
he's
a
member
as
interpreter.
he
doesn't
come
under
the
strictures
of
lemon...
of
wolman
and
meek
in
terms
of
the...
in
terms
of
his
function.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
you
bring
me
back
to
meek,
justice
souter.
in
meek,
i
find
nothing
by
which
the
court
said
that
a
hearing
aid,
for
example,
could
not
be
loaned
or
provided
to
a...
for
the
use
of
a
child
in
a
religious
school.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well,
in
our
case
it's
used...
the
interpreter
is
used
for
the
whole
educational
program,
and
there
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
fact
that
he
is
used
for
religious
purposes,
as
well
as
secular
purposes,
results
in
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion.
mr.
william
b.
ball
exactly.
mr.
william
b.
ball
but
it
was
a
problem
in
meek,
if
i
may
say
this,
only
because
the...
of
the
massive
size
of
the
program.
i
well
realize
what
the
court
said
in
meek
about
the
fact
that
the
inanimate
object
could
be
turned
to
religious
uses.
but
as
i've
reread
meek
very,
very
carefully,
it's
quite
clear
that
in
an
effort
to
distinguish
the
meek
situation
from
what
the
court
faced
in
allen
v.
board
of
education,
the
court
was
saying,
well,
here
you're
into
a
massive
program
of
supplying
materials
and
supplies
and
equipment
to
parochial
school
systems.
i
think
the
interpreter...
i
think
if
the
boy
must
be
denied
this...
the
service
of
an
interpreter
here
because
it
would
be
like
the
hearing
aid
and
that
the
hearing
aid
was
forbidden
in
meek,
i
don't
think
it
becomes
a
realistic
application
of
meek.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
answer
is
that--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--the
answer
is
that
i
will
not,
your
honor--
[laughter]
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
next
reason
given
by
the
respondent...
and
this
was
the
reasoning...
one
reason
of
the
court
of
appeals
why
the
furnishing
of
the
sign
language
interpreter
to
jim
would
have
had
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion...
is
that
it
would
have
created
a
symbolic
union
of
church
and
state.
and
this
can
be...
and
the
respondent
addresses
this
under
two
headings.
one
refers
the...
the
first
heading
refers
to
the
impressionable
youngsters,
jim's
peers,
who
would
be...
who
would
see
that
interpreter
as
symbolizing
a
union
of
church
and
state,
as
an
endorsement
by
the
school
district
of
a
catholic
school.
i
can
only
stretch
my
imagination
so
far,
but
it
goes
to
the
breaking
point
when
i'm
thinking
of
jim's
peers,
these
impressionable
youngsters,
saying
something
like,
guys,
you
see
that
fellow
who's
making
those
signs.
well,
it's
like
awesome.
right
here
in
chem
lab
we're
seeing
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause--
[laughter]
--of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
but--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--i
was
dealing
only
with
the
question
of
a
symbol,
an
image
of
endorsement,
in
the
eyes
of
impressionable
youngsters,
and
i
simply
don't
think
that
it...
that
that
flies,
that
these
children
would
do...
would
have
any
particular
impression
of
it.
if
they
did,
they
might
say
the
school
district
is
helping
jim.
well,
that's
neat.
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
far
more
likely
image
that
the
kids
would
have.
secondly,
they
say
that
furnishing
the
interpreter
would
create
the
image
of
a
joint
enterprise
of
church
and
state.
this
again...
here
they
rely
on
ball
v.
grand
rapids
school
district,
but
there
you
had
40
sectarian
schools.
you
had
a
massive
infiltration
of
teachers,
public
teachers,
into
religious
schools.
you
had
leasing
arrangements.
nothing
like
the
image
that
one
boy
with
one
interpreter
in
one
school
can
conceivably
provide
to
the
public.
the--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--oh,
very
much
so.
mr.
william
b.
ball
very
much
so,
yes.
here
the...
sign
language
interpreters
have
been
described
to
me
as
regarding
themselves
as
nonpersons,
which
gets
us
very
close
to
the
hearing
aid
example
that
justice
souter
raised.
i
think
the
primary
effect
that
this
furnishing
of
the
interpreter
would
have
is
simply
to
enable
a
youngster
to
get
an
education
in
the
general
branches
of
learning.
the
respondent
says
that
the...
that
one
reason
why
you
can
see
a
primary
effect
advancing
religion
here
is
that
the
parents
chose
a
religious
school,
and
their
motivation
was
to
get
him
a
religious
education.
of
course,
it
was,
but
was
there
not
a
far
more
obvious
reason,
namely,
to
get
this
boy
equipped
for
the
business
of
life
by
getting
an
education
in
the
general
branches
of
learning,
learning
the
same
math
that
will
be
learned
in
a
public
school,
the
same
modern
foreign
languages,
the
same
computer
literacy,
everything
that
he
would
get
in
a
public
school
in
order
to
enable
him
to
become
independent,
to
become
self-sustaining,
and
to
survive
in
a
world
not
always
hospitable
to
deaf
people?
there
has
been
much
talk
in
the
media
about
whether
we
are
seeking
an
overruling
in
this
case
of
lemon
v.
kurtzman.
nothing
in
lemon
bars,
as
we
see
it,
the
providing
of
this
service
to
this
boy.
i
think,
however,
that
the
respondents
and
their
supporting
amici
come
perilously
close
themselves
to
seeking
an
overruling
of
lemon
because
they
appear
to
ask
this
court
to
strike
the
primary
effects
test
from
the
lemon
test,
and
instead
of
saying
primary
effect,
advancing
religion,
they
seem
to
be
urging
the
court
to
say
any
effect
accommodating
religion.
i'll
reserve
what
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.
ball
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
interested
that
mr.
richardson
referred
to
the
arizona
school
boards
association
brief
amicus
curiae
in
connection
with
his
argument
that
the
interpreter
will
fulfill
a
teacher's
function.
exhibit...
or
the
first
appendix
to
the
arizona
school
boards'
brief
amicus
is
the
report
of
the
national
task
force
on
educational
interpreting,
and
it
says
that
the
interpreter's
task
in
a
school
is
interpreting.
that's
his
priority.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
role
of
the
educational
interpreter
should
not
include
classroom
management,
that
is
to
say,
formal
instruction
and
classroom
supervision.
the
court
in
meek
spoke
of
teachers
and
said
the
teacher
remains
a
teacher.
well,
the
interpreter
remains
an
interpreter
very,
very
clearly
under
the
ethical
code.
my
second
point
is--
