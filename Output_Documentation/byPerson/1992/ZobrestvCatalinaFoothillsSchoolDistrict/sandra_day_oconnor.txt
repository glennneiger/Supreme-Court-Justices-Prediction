day
o'connor
have
you
taken
a
look
at
the
statutory
provision
and
the
regulations
here,
and
are
you...
would
you
conclude
that
they
clearly
require
the
provision
of
the
services
in
private
schools?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
does
it
leave
it
open
to
the
state
to
decide?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
case
be
different
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
tutor
for
a
homebound
student
in
a
parochial
school,
someone
who
had
to
convey
their
own
views
of
the
materials
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--instruct
the
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
may
i
ask
whether
it
is
clear
here
that
the
statute
and
regulations
require
the
state
to
provide
this
service?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
arizona's
constitution,
for
example,
prohibited
the
furnishing
of
a...
of
services
like
this,
that
wouldn't
interfere
with
the
federal
scheme
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
richardson,
what
is
the
arizona
program
here?
does
it
provide
interpreters
for
deaf
children
in
private
schools
in
arizona?
is
that
arizona's
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is...
what
policy
are
we
looking
at
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
policy
of
the
school
district,
this
particular
school
district
in
catalina
foothills.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you...
was
it
conceded
below
that
arizona
and
the
school
district
are
required
to
provide
an
interpreter
to
a
deaf
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wasn't
that
ever
raised
or
discussed
or
dealt
with?
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
respondent
never
made
the
statutory
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
the
state
constitutional
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
richardson,
if
what
the
state
provided
for
a
student
was
simply
a
hearing
aid
so
the
student
could
go
to
the
parochial
school
and
hear
the
instruction,
is
that
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
it's
available
only
for
use
in
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
rely
on
meek.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
the
state
just
loaned
it
to
the
student.
