justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
at
page
34
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
recites
your
opposition
to
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
says
the
district
admits
that
the
eha
requires
it
to
provide
for
james,
as
part
of
a
free,
appropriate
public
education,
the
services
of
a
sign
language
interpreter
so
long
as
james
is
educated
in
a
nonparochial
setting.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
very,
very
clear
concession
on
your
part,
and
i
could
point
you
to
two
or
three
similar
statements
you've
made
in
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
and
in
your
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit
on
this
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
finding
that...
made
a
finding
error,
at
least
proceeded
on
the
explicit
assumption
that
this
was
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
putting
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
in
a
very
difficult
position
by
trying
now
to
tell
us
that
the
argument
is
still
open.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
objection
to
the
involvement?
that
it
will
be
seen
as
sponsorship
by
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
it
depend
on
the
reasonable
perception
of
the
reasonable
observer?
