justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
ask
you
a
different
question
about
what
may
just
positively
be
prohibited.
at
any
point
have
you
litigated
the
effect
of
the
arizona
constitution
or
the
effect
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
on
the
ultimate
question
of
entitlement
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
haven't
litigated
the
legal
as
distinct
from
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
haven't
litigated
the
question
of
legal
entitlement,
entitlement
under
the
law
and
the
regulations,
as
distinct
from
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
not
necessarily
faulting
you
for
it.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
am
right
that
the
record
simply
does
not
contain
determinations
on
these
two
issues.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
ball,
isn't
there
a
slightly
different
argument
which
has
greater
strength
here,
and
that
is
not
that
the
interpreter
is
going
to
inject
a
religious
element
that
is
not
there,
but
that
the
interpreter
is,
as
i
understand
it,
a
kind
of
necessary
functionary
for
the
religious
message
to
get
through?
and,
therefore,
the
interpreter
is...
in
effect,
is
just
as
necessary
as
having
the
teacher
or
the
priest
or
whatnot
there
and,
therefore,
is
just
as
much
an
integral
part
of
the
conveyance
of
the
religious
message
as
some
of
the
equipment,
for
example,
which
was
denied
to
schools
under
our
prior
cases
under
meek
and
wolman
on
the
theory
that
they
might
be
used
for
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
tape
recorders,
or
whatever
the
equipment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
in
those
cases,
i
suppose
didn't
acquire
any
such
aura
either,
and
yet
their
potential
use
for
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
communication
was
forbidden.
and
why
isn't
this
interpreter,
even
if
we
assume
the
kind
of
neutrality
of
the
role
that
you
describe,
in
the
same
boat
with
the
equipment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
a
hearing
aid
that
is
only
used
during
school
hours
when
the
school's
purpose
is
religious?
that
would
have
been
a
different
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
only
because
the
school
has
secular,
as
well
as
religious,
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interpreter
here
is
pretty
much
in
the
category
not
of
the
hearing
aid
that's
used
during
all
waking
hours
and
outside
the
school,
but
in
the
position
of
the
equipment
which
is
used
only
during
the
school,
which
was
the
problem
in
meek
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bryson,
may
i
just
keep
you
interrupted
for
a
moment
more
and
go
back
to
your
point
on
the
primary
effects
test?
if
you
accept
the
premise,
which
i
think
we
all
do,
that
the
interpreter
is
necessary
in
order
to
communicate
or
to
hear,
however
you
want
to
put
it,
the
message,
and
if
you
also
accept
the
premise,
which
is
that,
i
understand
it,
of
the
school,
that
the
intertwining
of
the
religious
and
the
secular
messages
are...
is
inextricable--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
is,
that
is
really
the
point
of
the
school
as
they
run
it...
does
it
make
any
sense
to
try
to
apply
a
primary
effects
test
here?
the
fact
is
the
entirety
of
the
message
is
going
to
have
a
religious
content,
a
religious
overlay,
a
religious
reference,
and
there's
no
way
to
communicate
or
to
hear
anything
without
communicating
or
hearing
the
religion.
under
those
circumstances,
does
the
primary
effects
test
make
any
sense?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
question
it
has
a
secular
function
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
nurse
would
have
no
role
in
the
communication
of
the
message.
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
but
at
least
in
those
hypos,
the
functionary
was
not
inextricably
bound
up
with
the
communication
of
the
message
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
you
have
not
stipulated
or
agreed
that
you
are
required
to
provide
it
in
a
parochial
school?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
even
before
that.
i
mean,
you
never
stipulated
at
the
injunction
hearing
that
you
were
required
to
provide
it
in
the
parochial
setting,
did
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
before
you
go
on
with
that,
may
i
ask
you
this?
don't
you
understand
there
to
be
at
least
a
potential
difference
under
the
regulations
between
what
you
may
be
provided
or,
indeed,
permitted
to
do
with
respect
to
a
child
in
a
parochial
school
and
one
who
is
in
a
private,
but
nonreligious
school?
isn't
there
a
potential
distinction
at
least
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
don't
want
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it,
but
i'm
looking
at
the
regulation,
which
is
set
out
on
page
45a
of
the
government's
brief,
which
i
assume
is
applicable
here,
that
no
state
may
use
its
grant...
and
i'm
skipping
inessential
language...
to
pay
for
religious
instruction.
doesn't
that
have
an
effect
in
distinguishing
between
church
and
nonchurch
private
schools?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
in
your
response
to
justice
white,
you
spoke
about
the
need
to
make
a
judgment
statewide
about
the
appropriateness
of
your
providing
this
kind
of
service
in
a
private
school
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
addressing
in
that
answer
a
different
regulation
from
the
one
that
i
mentioned?
aren't
you
addressing
the
regulation
that...
i
couldn't
possibly
quote
it,
but
it
speaks
something
about
its
being
equitable
to
provide
these
kinds
of
services
in
a
private
school
setting?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
that...
but
that's
a
different
regulation
from
the
one
that
i
mentioned.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
presume...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
take
a
final
position
on
this
any
more
than
i
would,
but
i
assume
that
in
any
argument,
based
on
the
statute
and
the
regulations
issued
under
it,
you
would
also
have
based
an
argument
on
the
section
that
i
quoted
a
moment
ago,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
statewide
practice,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
basically
you
wanted
to
keep
the
united
states
off
your
back,
and
you
realized
you
were
not
going
to
have
any
trouble
with
the
united
states
on
that
issue.
and
that's
why
it
was
not
litigated.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
