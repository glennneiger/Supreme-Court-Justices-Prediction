justice

white
i
thought
the
argument
was
for
establishment
that
here
is
the
state
furnishing
directly
financial
support
for
a
sectarian
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
that
symbolism
business.
it's
just
that
they're...
you're
not
supposed
to
furnish
money
to
a...
you
think
the
state
could...
under
our
cases
could
just
pay
for
the...
pay
for...
contribute
to
the
sectarian
schools
the
amount
of
that
to
the
extent
they
are
furnishing
a
secular
education?
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
the
money
from
the
school
district
went
directly
to
the
parents
to
hire
a...
an
interpreter?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
a
public...
suppose
the
interpreter,
the
sign
language
interpreter,
in
a
public
school
is
paid
on
a
piecework
basis
and
the...
and
but
that
same
public
person
is
paid
by
the
parents
on
a
piecework
basis
to
go
over
to
the
parochial
school.
would
that
bother
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
school
district
just
giving
money
to
the
parochial
school
to
hire
a
sign
language
interpreter?
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
only
reason
that
you
didn't
provide
it
to
him
was
because
he
was
going
to
a
parochial
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
other
private
school,
you
would
have
provided
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
except
for
the
establishment
clause,
you
would
have
been
willing
to
furnish
this
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
you
thought
that
the
federal
government...
the
act
and
the
regulations
would
have
permitted
you
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
do
you
think
the
regulations
under
the
act
would
have
permitted
you
to...
without
any
thought
of
the
constitutional
issue,
do
you
think
the
regulations
would
have
permitted
you
to
do
this
at
the
parochial
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
you
raise
this
statutory
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
you
raise
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
surprised
the
united
states
argument
here
is
with
the
petitioner,
and
i
would
have
thought
they
wouldn't
be
there
if
they
thought
that
the
federal
act
would
have
forbidden
you
to
furnish
these
services.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
somebody
had
invented
a
robot
that
could
listen
and
then
give...
make
these
signs,
sign
language,
sort
of
like
simultaneous
translations
in
the
u.n.,
you
wouldn't
be
here
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
wouldn't
be
a
public
employee.
