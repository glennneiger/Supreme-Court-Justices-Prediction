mr.
john
c.
richardson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
law
can
require
a
public
school
district
to
hire
and
place
in
a
parochial
school
classroom
an
employee
to
actively
participate
in
a
student's
religious
education.
the
first
amendment
answer
to
this
question
is
no.
in
1970--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--we
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
because
this
court's
decision
in
witters
case
has
indicated
that
there's
a
difference...
and
we
think
there
is
a
crucial
difference...
between
a
public
employee,
standing
as
a
public
employee
in
the
classroom
and
in...
and
conveying
religious
information
to
james
than
if
the
state
on
a
one-time
payment
pays
his
family
for
a
service
that
he
needs
because
in
that
case,
the
person
in
the
classroom
conveying
religious
information
is
a...
is
the
zobrest's
employee,
not
the
school
district.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
i
think
the
critical
distinction
is,
if
i
understand
the
question,
is...
to
me
is
whether
the
person
in
the
classroom
that's
transmitting
the
religious
information
is
or
is
not
a
public
employee
functioning
at
public
expense.
we
think
in
witters,
this
court
carved
out
an
exception
that
said
when
the
state
provides
money
to
a
student
or
his
family
and
then
takes
a
hands-off
approach...
and
that's
a
second
condition
that
we
think
would
be
necessary
that
is
not
present
in
this
case
also...
takes
a
hands-off
approach,
other
than
saying
here's
what
it's
for,
but
after
that,
you
go
get
the
service,
if
mr.
witters
in
the
state
of
washington
is
going
to
go
out
and
receive
education
to
become
a
pastor,
we
don't
see
why
mr.
and
mrs.
zobrest
could
not
go
out
and
purchase
this--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--of
course,
that's
a
different
scenario
between
giving
money
to
the
school
and
the
parent,
but
i
will
address
that
one.
we
don't
think
we
could
give
money
to
the
school.
we
only
think
we
could
constitutionally,
under
witters,
give
it
to
the
parent
or
student.
but
there
are
two
reasons
why
that
doesn't
happen.
first,
the
individuals
with
disabilities
and
education
act
does
not
permit
us
to,
and
second,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
made
it
very
clear
that
they
are
not
seeking
money.
they
are
seeking
a
service.
they
have
made
it
unambiguous,
but
what
they
want
is
a
public
employee
standing
in
that
parochial
classroom
and
informing
james
zobrest,
after
hearing
it
from
the
teacher,
that
there's
life
after
death.
that's
make
a
critical
distinction.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
across
the
board?
we
don't
know
because
we
haven't
gotten
there.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
situation
where
a
deaf
person...
a
deaf
student
has
been
in
a
private
school.
one
of
the
reasons...
the
way
this
case
arose--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--we
are
looking--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--we're
not
even
looking
at
a
school-wide
policy
because
these
things
are
so...
this
particular
application
is
so
unusual.
the
school
district...
the
state
policy
is
to
provide
generally
related
services
in
special
education.
it
doesn't
get
defined
down
to
a
fine
tune,
but
it
is
not
on
a
student-by-student
basis.
it's
just
overall.
one
of
the
difficulties
in
these
kind
of
cases--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--we
think
it
is
not
conceded,
and
we
disagree
with
respondents
in
this...
in
the
position--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--we'll
explain
why.
we
think
there
are
three
potential
bases
why
this
case
could
have
been
decided.
and
we,
in
our
summary
judgment,
rose
only
the
federal
constitutional
issues,
and
that's
why
the
case
has
come
to
this
point.
we
also
think
there's
a
statutory
argument
to
be
made,
and
we
think
there's
a
state
constitutional
argument
to
be
made.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we
did
not
yet
in
the
case.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we
did
not
yet
because
we
can
choose
to
bring
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
a
particular
issue.
we
brought
it
on
one
issue.
it
did
not...
and
we
won
on
that
particular
issue.
we
stated
expressly
in
our
briefs
that
we
think
the
remaining
issues
would
remain
unadjudicated.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
okay.
that...
well,
i
agree
that...
this
case
was
filed
on
august
1.
in
the
rush
of
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing,
we
made
that
statement
in
the
opposition,
and
that
statement
is
legally
incorrect.
we
do
not
think
we
have
any
judicial
estoppel
from
that
legal
conclusion.
we
think
that
if
the
district
court
thinks
so,
fine,
but
we
don't
think
the
district
court
will
think
so.
there
was
no
argument
in
this
case--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--my--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--i
understand
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
that
statement
and
that
surprised
me.
in
our
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
state
expressly
on
page
6,
footnote
3
of
that
brief
that
it
has
never
technically
been
necessary
to
litigate
the
statutory
issue.
we
did
admit...
and
i
think
is
where
the
ninth
circuit
made
its
error
in
that
statement.
we
did
admit
and
will
admit
today
that
james...
if
james
zobrest
had
attended
a
private,
nonparochial
school,
we
would
have
provided
it.
there's
a
difference
between
would
have
provided
it
and
would
have
been
required
to
provide
it
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we
have
always
admitted
that.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we
would...
we
would
have
provided
it,
but
i
think
there's
a
distinction
there
between
would
have
legally
been
required
to
provide
it
and
would
have.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
that...
that's
correct.
we
don't
deny
that,
that
we
would
have
voluntarily
done
that.
the
only
concern
that
came
up
at
the
time
was
the
establishment
clause
concern,
and
that's
true.
and
we're
admitting
that.
we
knew--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--that's
correct.
the
stipulation...
once
we
got
past
that
preliminary
injunction
hearing,
we
very
carefully
stipulated
in
the
stipulation
of
facts--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--that's
absolutely
correct.
there
has
never
been
a
statement
ever
made
by
the
respondent
school
district
that
we
would
be
legally
required.
we
would
have,
but
not
legally
required.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we
would
have.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
that's
right.
james
zobrest
is--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--i
think
that
you
can...
there's
a
potential
distinction,
but
i
think
the
bigger
distinction
is
between
public
and
private
in
general.
i
think
the
united
states--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--amicus
brief
makes
very
clear--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--absolutely,
and
let's
use
an
example.
many
students
under
the
idea
have
mental
disabilities.
they
need
the
services
of
a
one-on-one
aid
to
assist
them
academically
in
the
classroom.
now,
in
many
cases,
when
a
student
attends
a
nonparochial
school,
a
private
nonparochial
school,
we
may
choose
to
give
that
aid
because
all
they're
going
to
do
is
assist
the
student
in
a
secular
education.
but
if
you
take
that
exact
situation
and
put
it
in
a
parochial
school,
you
would
have
an
employee
whose
job
it
would
be
to
reinforce
educational
doctrine.
james
zobrest
himself,
when
he
went
to
junior
high
school
at
catalina
foothills
school
district,
was
not
only
provided
with
a
sign
language
interpreter,
not
only
provided
with
speech
therapy,
but
he...
but
the
iep,
which
is
in
the
record,
states
that
he
was
provided
academic
classroom
assistance.
now,
i
can
think
of
few
situations
that
would
be
more
counter
to
the
first
amendment
than
to
think
of
an
employee
sitting
in
a
parochial
classroom
not
even
mechanically
signing,
but
assisting
in
his
required
class
on
religion
and
the
other
classes--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
no,
not
for
this
service.
for
other
services.
we
continue
to
provide
him
speech
therapy
services
because
those
are
unrelated.
we
would
not--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--no,
because
those
regulations
have
what
they
term
the
edgar
regulations,
that
have
been
discussed
in
the
brief,
that
prohibit
any
of
these
program
monies
to
go
for
religious
instruction.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
because
it
was
not
raised...
because
that--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--because
the
reality
of
dealing
with
the
statute
is
that
you
have
to
look
statewide,
because
it's
going
to
take
a
long,
expensive
trial
because
the
answer
isn't
a
simple
yes
or
no
like
i
probably
just
told
you,
but
it
would
depend
on
the
number
of
statewide
students
in
private
schools
who
have
disabilities.
the
united
states
has
consistently
taken
the
position
in
these
cases
that
whether
a
particular
private
school
student
is
entitled
to
a
particular
service
requires
you
to
look
statewide
at
all
the
private
school
students
with
disabilities
and
whether
they're
generally
provided
equitable
opportunities.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
well,
they
don't
because
they
think
edgar
is...
these
regs
are
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
and
they
don't
think
the
first
amendment
is
violated.
we
think
the
first
amendment
is
violated,
and
even
if
we
accept
their
premise
that
the
edgar
regulations
merely
restate
the
first
amendment,
we
obviously
think,
since
the
first
amendment
is
violated,
so
is
edgar.
so--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes.
we
had
already
been
informed,
however,
that
that
just
mirrors
the
first
amendment,
and
so
the
united
states
had
taken
positions
before
with
the
department
of
education
in
letter
rulings
that
those
two
are
coextensive.
so,
the
court
ends
up
always
looking
at
the
constitutional
issue
to
define
that.
now--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--yes.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
i
mean,
our
funds
have
eventually
come...
at
least
11
and
a
half
percent
of
them...
from
the
united
states,
and
if
we
take
a
distinction...
a
variance
between
that
statute
and
the
establishment
clause,
we
aren't
going
to
be
considered
in
compliance.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
it
depends
how
the
hearing
aid
is
provided.
i
think
the
relevant
distinction
was
made
in
the
earlier
argument.
if
a
hearing
aid
is
provided
for
an
individual's
general
use,
i
think
there
is
no
constitutional
concern.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
and
if
we
add
the
fact,
under
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act
under
34
c.f.r.
76-652,
that
the
state
must
have
continuing
administration,
control
over
that
property,
i
think
this
court's
lessons
in
meek
and
wolman
would
say
that
is
not
permitted.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes,
i
would
rely
on
meek
and
wolman,
plus
the
added
fact
that
under
this
particular
statutory
scheme,
the
state
for
that
property...
again,
it's
unlike
the
money.
they
can't
just
give
it
to
the
student
and
say
now
it's
yours.
they
must
maintain
continuing
control
over
that
property.
but
we
also--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--well,
if
they
loaned
it
and
could
take
a
hands-off,
that
would
probably
provide
a
different
answer,
but
that's
not
what's
permitted
under
the
idea.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
because--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--it's
not
just
the
repair,
but
it's
the
continuing
jurisdiction
and
control,
and
maybe
simply
a
loan
isn't
enough.
maybe
they'd
have
to
completely
give
it.
but
they
can
give
money
to
a
student.
perhaps
they
could
give
the
hearing
aid
too.
it
takes
the
state
issue
out
of
it
because
is
it
the
state's
hearing
aid
in
the
classroom,
or
is
it
james
zobrest's
hearing
aid?
if
it's
james
zobrest's
hearing
aid,
i
have
no
concern.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
well,
look
at
what
we
have
in
witters.
the
state
is
able
to
give--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--yes,
it
is.
[laughter]
i
mean,
the
answer
is
yes
because,
look,
they
can
give
mr.
witters
the
money
and
he
can
go
learn
to
be
a
pastor
with
it,
but
they
couldn't
pay
the
thing
to--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--that
would
be
fine,
but
i
also
think
what
you
have
is
a
situation--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--i
also
think
you
have
a
situation
where
we
think
there
is
a
critical
distinction
between
a
machine
and
a
human
being,
and
they
like
to
equate
it
to
a
hearing
aid.
but
you're
never
going
to
consider
a
hearing
aid
part
of
the
educational
team.
you
look
at
exhibit
a
to
the
arizona
school
boards
association
amicus
brief.
it's
a
document
entitled
educational
interpreting
for
deaf
students:
a
national
task
force.
the
professionals
in
the
area
say
an
interpreter
is...
should
properly
be
considered
part
of
the
educational
team
working
in
close
cooperation
with
the
school
teacher
to
impart
the
educational
lessons
of
the
teacher.
in
this
case,
those
educational
lessons
are
spiritual
as
well
as
secular.
you're
never
going
to
say
that
the
hearing
aid
is
part
of
the
team.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
well,
no,
i
think
that
presents
a
much
more
difficult
situation
than
ours,
but
under
meek
v.
wolman,
if
you...
i
see
no
difference
between
that
and
a
tape
recorder.
and
also,
in
meek
v.
wolman--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--they
only
had
the
potential
to
be
used
for--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--it
would
not
be
a
public
employee.
that's
right.
but
either
is
a
tape
recorder,
and
right
now
the
tape
recorder
is
constitutionally
prohibited.
and
the
only
distinction
that
mr.
ball
makes
is
the
massive
size.
but
i
think
that's
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
how
can
we
provide,
you
know,
1
bible
to
a
student
as
opposed
to
500?
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
how
many
mechanical
devices
would
we
have
to
give
to
assist
parochial
school
students
in
their
parochial
education
before
it
would
become
a
massive
program?
mr.
john
c.
richardson
absolutely.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
passive
accommodation.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
i
think
that's
still
passive
accommodation
to
rent--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--to
rent
the
loud
speakers.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
there's
a
difference
between
engaging
in
a
religious
activity.
in
1970,
what
we
started
out...
even
before
lemon,
this
court
said
that
there
are
three
evils
that
the
first
amendment
seeks
to
prevent:
sponsorship,
financial
support,
and
active
involvement
of
the
sovereign
in
a
religious
activity.
i
do
not
believe
that
merely
rental
or
fair
market
value
is
anything
more
than
passive
accommodation.
i
don't
think
that's
active
involvement
in
the
sovereign
even
if
they
rent
the
whole
hall.
but
i
think
when
you
take
a
public
employee,
and
you
ask
that
public
employee
to
go
to
work
and
during
that
person's
job
duties
to
convey
to
james
zobrest
that
jesus
christ
was
the
son
of
god
or
that
he
died
to
save
his
sins,
i
think
that's
active
involvement
in
a
religious
activity.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
because
that
does
not
involve
them
in
the
delivery
of
the
religious
message.
we
provided
james
zobrest
speech
therapy
services
throughout
his
four
years
at
salpointe,
and
we
had
no
objection
to
doing
so.
and
if
that
made
james
zobrest
more
successful
in
his
education
at
salpointe,
so
be
it.
we
don't...
we
have
no
problem
with
providing
related
services
that
don't
make
the
public
employee
become
integrally
involved
in
the
religious
indoctrination
that
occurs
in
a
parochial
school
classroom.
we
even
had
an
example
about
someone
pushing
someone
around
in
a
wheel
chair.
i
think
that's
a
substantially
different
case.
you
just
can't
make
it...
the
only
thing
they
try
to...
because
the
wheelchair
pusher
is
not
going
to
be
involved--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--absolutely.
those
are
very
different.
but
what
they
try
to
do
is
make
the
distinction
that
because
this
person
operates
mechanically,
therefore,
per
se,
he
cannot
be...
he
or
she
can't
be
involved
in
a
religious
activity.
therefore,
that
follows.
well,
let's
look
at
another
example.
let's
look
at
an
altar
boy
in
church.
an
altar
boy
moves
the
missal
from
one
side
of
the
altar
to
the
other.
he
takes
the
wine
and
the
water
to
the
priest
to
assist
in
preparation
of
communion.
he
lights
and
put...
puts
out
candle.
every
activity
that
altar
boy
undertakes
is
choreographed
in
advance.
every
genuflect
has
been
done
the
same
way
for
10
years.
the
altar
boy
exercises
no
discretion
at
all,
but
is
there
any
doubt
that
that
person
is
involved
in
a
religious
activity
during
those
activities
during
sunday
mass?
of
course,
not.
the
same
is
true
with
the
interpreter
in
this
case.
there
are
many,
many
related
services
that
the
school
district
can
give
that
will
not
involve
the
employee
in
the
direct
religious
indoctrination
process.
the
school
district
has
no
problem
with--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--absolutely.
it
is
not
even
just
sponsorship.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
yes,
but
you
know,
in
this...
and
it
does.
but
when
you
look
at...
it
has
to
be
both
a
subjective...
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
her
concurring
opinion
in
lynch,
there
has
to
be
both
a
subjective
and
an
objective
determination
in
that
regard.
and
as
this
court's
opinion
said
last
term
in
lee
v.
weisman,
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
at
a
minimum
the
constitution
guarantees
the
government
may
not
coerce
anyone
to
support
or
participate
in
religion
or
its
exercise.
even
the
justices
that
dissented
in
lee
v.
weisman
stated
expressly
that
they
agreed
with
that
proposition.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
i
believe
it
is
in
this
situation
because
let's
say
james
needed
a
tutor
to
help
him
academically.
we
would
say
the
same
thing
because
if
you
go
to
any
school
other
than
this...
than
a
parochial
school,
it
would...
we
don't
have
to
do
anything
but
provide
you
a
secular
education.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
it
makes
it
fair--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--because
this
court
has
always
acknowledged
a
limitation
on
what
we
have
to
do
when
it
transcends
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we'd
be--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--and
if
congress
wants
to
amend
the
statute
to
permit
that
option,
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
we
don't
have
any
authority
to
give
another
option.
we
don't
have
authority,
statutory
authority,
in
arizona
to
pay
the
parents
directly,
and
that...
it's
like
books.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
he
chooses
to
go
to
the
public
school,
he
gets
all
his
books
for
free.
he
doesn't
get
all
his
books
for
free
when
he
chooses
to
go
to
a
parochial
school.
and
certainly
you
could
provide
free
secular
textbooks,
but
it's
still
just
a
disincentive
that
he'd
have
to
pay
for
his
religious
texts.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
the
same
way
with
field
trip
transportation.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
that
is
neutrality
as
this
court
has
defined
it
because
we
have
the
limitation
of
the
establishment
clause
that
public
employees
shouldn't
become
involved
in
religious
activities.
i
mean,
if
we
provide
it,
if
we--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--okay.
we
cannot
pay
for
the
services
as
the
federal
law
is
established,
and
all
we're
saying
is
in
this
particular
application,
under
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act,
we
can't
provide
the
particular
service.
it
only
allows
us
to
provide
the
service
because
it
would
make
us
become
directly
involved
in
a
religious
activity
or,
as
we
said
last
term,
in
the
support
of
religion
or
its
exercise
because
what
is
going
on
in
that
classroom
is
the
exercise
of
religion.
and
that
limitation
has
always
been.
even
the
states
that
said
we
will
give
you
secular
textbooks
still
didn't
give
them
all
the
textbooks.
even
the
ones
that
said
we'll
give
you
bus
transportation
still
doesn't
give
parochial
students
field
trip
bus
transportation
because
that's--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--i
like
the
distinction--
mr.
john
c.
richardson
--i
like
the
distinction
that
public
employees
cannot
be
involved
in
religious
activities.
you...
you
know,
if
this
court
wants
to
reanalyze
whether
bus
transportation
is
that,
so
be
it.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
john
c.
richardson
but
i
think
the
interpreter's
activity
of
informing
james
zobrest
whether
there's
everlasting
life
is
and
i
think
that's
the
importance
in
this
case.
in
summary,
the
school
district
has
no
objection
to
the
fact
that
congress
requires
it
under
the
idea
to
provide
public
school
students
special
education
and
related
services
and
even,
under
some
circumstances,
to
private
school
students.
we
have
no
objection
to
the
fact
that
james
zobrest,
who's
an
outstanding
young
man,
chose
to
attend
salpointe.
we
gladly
provided
him
speech
therapy
services,
and
you
can't
use
the
but
for
analysis
that
the
government
would.
if
that
speech
therapy
allowed
him
to
perform
his
academic...
to
do
academically
better,
so
be
it.
we
draw
the
line
in
only
one
place.
when
that
federal
law...
when
someone
tells
us
that
that
federal
law
makes
us
take
a
public
employee
and
put
them
in
a
parochial
school
classroom
to
have
daily
essential
involvement
in
the
religious
educational
process
in
that
classroom,
under
those
circumstances,
the
governing
board
members
must
be
able
to
assure
themselves
and
their
taxpaying
constituents
and
their
employees
that
their
monies
and
that
their
efforts
are
not
being
used
to
religiously
indoctrinate
a
student.
the
school
board
asks
nothing
more,
and
the
first
amendment
commands
no
less.
thank
you.
