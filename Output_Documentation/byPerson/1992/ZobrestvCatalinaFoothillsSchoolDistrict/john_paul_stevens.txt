yes,
but...
may
i
just...
perhaps
it's
too
minor,
but
at
least
they
will
have
him
paying
his
tuition
there.
if
he
can't
get
the
interpreter,
he'd
have
to
go
to
school
someplace
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
but
his
parents
are
paying
the
tuition
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
will
not
be
paying
that
tuition
to
the
school
if
he
goes
to
school
someplace
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
so
that
if
he
doesn't
get
the
interpreter,
he
won't
attend
the
school,
and
they
won't
get
that
particular
tuition.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
it's
perhaps
a
small
point.
but
is
it
not
true
that
he
needs
an
interpreter
wherever
he
goes
to
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
can't
get
it
here,
he'll
have
to
go
to
school
elsewhere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
school
would
lose
that
amount
of
tuition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
that's
not
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
will
lose
at
least
that
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
probably
more
than
the
cost
of
the
interpreter,
isn't
it?
