mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
mr.
ball
that
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
second
test
from
lemon
is
satisfied,
and
we
submit
that
the
primary
effect
in
this
case
of
the
benefit
that
was
conferred
is
not
to
advance
religion
and
that
the
second
test
in
lemon,
therefore,
would
indicate
that
this
is
not
an
establishment
of
religion.
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
perhaps
the
most
succinct
statement
of
the
test
under
lemon,
the
succinct...
most
succinct
recent
statement
that
this
court
has
made,
and
that
comes
in
a
concurring
opinion
of
justice
powell...
excuse
me...
which
was
joined
by
two
other
members
of
the
court
and
was
endorsed
by
yet
another
two
members
of
the
court.
so,
in
a
sense,
it
speaks
for
a
majority
of
the
court
in
the
witters
case.
and
he
said,
quote,
state
programs
that
are
wholly
neutral
in
offering
education
assistance
to
a
class,
defined
without
reference
to
religion,
do
not
violate
the
second
part
of
the
lemon
test
because
any
aid
to
religion
results
from
the
private
choices
of
individual
beneficiaries.
now,
that
is
this
case,
as
we
see
it.
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
has
to
understand
the
words.
i'm
not
sure
he
has
to
understand
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
of
course,
he
could
turn
down
the
assignment
for
any
reason
he
chose.
he
could
turn
down
the
assignment
because
he
had
to
drive
too
far.
but
typically
with
sign
language
interpreters--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
he...
this
is
a
state
government,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
could...
typically
sign
language
interpreters
have
many
occasions
in
which
they
will
hear
things
that
they
disagree
with
and
will
sign
them
nonetheless.
that's
just
part
of
the
job.
they
are
not
expected
to
agree
or
disagree
with
whatever
they're
signing,
and
they're
not
expected
to
change,
by
virtue
of
their
own
predilections,
anything
that
they
hear.
now,
the
themes
that
i
think
that
you
can
trace
through
this
court's
establishment
clause
cases,
in
the
aid
to
schools
area
at
least,
that
we
can
tease
out
from
justice
powell's
statement
are
as
follows.
first,
where
the
service
is
made
available
directly
to
the
individual
as
opposed
to
the
school,
you
will
ordinarily
not
find
an
establishment
clause
violation.
similarly,
where
there's
a
broad
class
that
is
the
recipient
of
the
service
that
is
not
based
on
religion...
in
this
case,
everyone
who
is
the
subject
of
a
disability
was
a
student...
that
also
indicates
no
establishment
clause
problem.
third,
where
the
school
gets
no
financial
benefit
out
of
the
arrangement.
and
here,
i
think
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
point
that
the
school
does,
after
all,
get
the
tuition,
this
court
has
been
very
clear
in
cases
going
back
to
everson,
which
was
the
bus
transportation
case,
and
going
through
the
allen
case
and
the
mueller
case,
the
tax
deduction
case,
and
witters,
witters
in
particular,
that
the
fact
that
the
school
gets
another
student
and
the
associated
tuition
is
not
enough
to
constitute
a
primary
effect
for
lemon,
the
second
part
of
the
lemon
test,
purposes.
so,
there's
no
financial
benefit
here.
salpointe
is
essentially
in
a
position
of
just
being
a
stakeholder
with
respect
to
the
financial
impact
of
this
arrangement.
and
finally,
that...
you
have
to
ask
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
expression
of
endorsement
or
support
for
the
religious
view
that
is
being
put
forward
or
for
religion
at
all.
and
here
again,
we
submit
that
there
is
neither
any
implicit
support
on
the
part
of
the
state
for
anything
that's
being
said
here
in
the
religious
school
merely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
is
providing
the
child
a
means
to
hear
what's
being
said,
nor
is
there
any
sense
in
which
the
state
is
somehow
endorsing
the
message
of
salpointe
high
school
in
general
by
providing
an
interpreter
there.
the
interpreter
is
serving
as
this
child's
ears.
this
interpreter
is
doing
nothing
more
than
performing
at
the
state's
behest
the
service
of
enabling
this
child
to
hear
whatever
it
is
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
statutes
and
regulations,
your
honor,
do
not
require
it.
the
statute
operates
essentially
as
this.
the
statute
gives
local
educational
agencies
a
great
deal
of
freedom
to
design
programs
as
they
will.
that
may
mean
in
some
cases
that
the
local
educational
agency
will
say
we
are
going
to
provide
certain
services,
but
only
in
the
public
schools
because
it's
just
impractical
to
do
it.
there's
nothing
that
compels.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there's
a
provision...
the
short
answer
is
no,
it
wouldn't.
the
somewhat
longer
answer
is
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
allows
what's
called
bypass,
which
is
to
say,
if
there's
something
about
local
law
that
generally
precludes
a
certain
type
of
service,
then
you
can
go
directly
to
the
federal
bypass
provision
and
you
can
get
aid
directly
from
the
federal
government.
so,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
that
deals
with
that
problem.
but
the
way
this
case
comes
to
the
court
is
that
it
was
conceded
all
the
way
along
that
this
service
would
be
available
to
this
child
except
for
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
religious
school
and
only
then,
not
because
of
the
choice
of
the
school
district,
but
only
because
the
school
district
felt
compelled
by
the
establishment
clause
to
say
no.
this
case
has
been
purely
an
establishment
clause
defense
to
what
otherwise
would
be
the
school
district's
conceded
acknowledgement
that
under
their
own
policies
they
would
provide
the
service
to
the
child
in
place.
now,
the
school
district--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
and
that
is
because
what
we're
concerned
with
is
asking...
is,
does
this
benefit
itself
actually
have
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion?
here,
the
state
has
acknowledged
that
he
can
get
an
education
at
this
school
that
satisfies
the
state's
requirements.
so,
they
have
defined
this
institution
as
a
valid
secondary
school
for
arizona
purposes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
you
would
apply
primary
effect
to
this
case
just
as
you
would
to
the
bus
driver
case
or
a
case
in
which,
for
example,
the
school
district
provided...
suppose
we
had
a
severely
paralyzed
child
who
needed
a
nurse
to
wheel
him
in
a
wheel
chair
from
one
class
to
another,
including
religion
classes.
we
submit
that
that
would
not
have
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion
because
although
the
nurse's
availability
would
be
necessary
to
his
getting
his
education
and
in
this
place,
the
state
would
not
be
in
any
way
promoting
religion.
it
would
be
making
it
possible,
it
is
true,
for
him
to
have
a
religious
education.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
would
have
the
effect,
just
as
the
bus
driver...
the
availability
of
a
bus
driver
to
drive
him
to
school
would
make
it
possible
for
him--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--to
receive
the
message.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
that
the
only
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
in
this
case
the
state
employee
is
actually
mouthing
words
as
opposed
to
performing
some
other
service
that's
inextricably
associated
with
the
receipt
of
the
message.
take,
for
example,
another
hypothetical,
a
technician
on
a
computer
that
serves
to
translate
written
materials
into
spoken
materials,
and
there
are
such
computers
for
someone
who's
blind.
well,
the
technician
isn't
actually
speaking
the
words.
it's
not
like
a
blind
reader,
but
the
technician
is
equally
central,
essential
to
the
operation
of
communication.
and
we
would
say
that
that
is
perfectly
all
right
under
the
establishment
clause.
thank
you.
