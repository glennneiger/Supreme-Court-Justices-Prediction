mr.
ball,
before
you
get
too
far,
just
clarify
one
point
for
me.
under
the
statute,
could...
does
the
statute
only
provide
for
in-kind
furnishing
of
services?
would
the
statute
not
permit
the
parents
to
hire
their
own
sign
language
interpreter
and
be
reimbursed?
justice
antonin
scalia
1415
is
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
unless
the
school
loses
money
on
each
child,
which
a
lot
of
schools
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
deficit
made
up
out
of
contributions.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
ball,
you're
not
really
going
to
try
to
reconcile
all
our
entanglement
cases,
are
you,
or
anything?
[laughter]
are
you
going
to
tell
us
why
a
globe
is
okay,
but
a
book
isn't
and
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
senator
moynihan's
question,
what
about
a
map
and
a
book?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
a
little
concerned
about
the
interpreter
here.
he's
a
public
employee,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
is
directed
to
go
to
a
catholic
school
and
listen
to
sectarian
theology
and
then
impart
it
to...
i
assume
he
has
to
listen
to
it
and
understand
it
before
he
can
translate
it.
right?
doesn't
that
trouble
you?
it
troubles
me
a
bit.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
has
to
listen
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
to
listen
to
it.
i
mean,
what
if
he's
a...
you
know,
an
adamant
anti-catholic?
can
he
turn
down
the
assignment?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is...
does
the
federal
government
let
you
do
that?
i
mean,
it's
a--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
a
state
government.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
reason
you
didn't
do
it
was
because
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
had
this
been
a
private
school,
it
would
have
been
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
public
provide
a
hall
at
which
a
religious
ceremony
is
conducted?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
loud
speakers.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
the
loud
speakers
are
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
we
get
into
tape
recorders,
that's
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
public
employee
driving
james
to
the
school
where
he's
going
to
learn
about
god?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
okay,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
like
the
bus
driver.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
richardson,
if
that
is
the
problem,
if
there
is
some
difficulty,
symbolic
or
otherwise,
about
having
a
public
official
in
this
context,
then
don't
you
think
maybe
the
state
has
some
other...
some
obligation
in
some
other
fashion
not
to
impose
upon
a
family
with
a
deaf
child
a
disincentive
to
go
to
a
religious
school?
the
child
is,
in
effect,
told
go
to
any
school
you
want.
you
will
have
an
interpreter.
but
if
you
go
to
a
religious
school,
no
interpreter.
now,
is
that
consistent
with
neutrality?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
just
repeated
it.
why
does
that
make
it
fair?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--tell
me
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
only
limitation...
but
you...
but
there
are
other
ways
to
get
around
it.
if
that
does
violate
the
establishment
clause,
then
pay
cash
money
to
the
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
should
not
be
a
disincentive
to
the
parents
to
send
their
child
to
the
parochial
school,
should
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
saying
maybe
one
option
or
the
other
must
be
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
different.
i
mean,
that's...
you
go
to
the
public
school
or
not.
but
this
is
saying
even
if
you
don't
go
the
public
school,
you
can
go
to
any
other
school
and
get
the
interpreter,
but
not
to
a
religious
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
neutrality.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
get
them
involved
in
religious
activities.
you
could
pay
for
the
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
like
that
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
has
never
struck
me
as
one
of
the
better
ones.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--religious
activity,
busing
them
to
the
zoo
for
a
field
trip?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
don't
think
so.
