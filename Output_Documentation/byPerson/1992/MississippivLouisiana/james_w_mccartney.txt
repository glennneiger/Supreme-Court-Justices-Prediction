mr.
james
w.
mccartney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
action
involves
the
boundary
between
the
states
of
mississippi,
louisiana,
and
the
private
ownership
of
a
body
of
land
known
as
stack
island
or
island
no.
94,
patented
by
the
united
states
as
mississippi
land
in
1881.
the
identity
and
physical
location
of
this
island,
which
is
the
only
island
at
issue
in
this
case,
can
be
traced
from
ancient
maps
beginning
in
1826
through
aerial
photographs
beginning
in
1932
through
hydrographic,
u.s.
hydrographic
maps
up
to
the
present
time.
so
the
island,
according
to
the
evidence
before
the
trial
court
and
as
the
trial
court
found,
has
been
in
existence
at
least
since
1881
and
can
be
identified
today.
now
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
with
respect
to
the
applicable
boundary
law.
this
court
has
many
times
said,
even
in
controversies
between
louisiana
and
mississippi,
that
the
thalweg,
that's
corrupted
in
louisiana
and
mississippi
to
thalweg,
of
the
mississippi
river
forms
the
boundary
between
the
states,
and
that
boundary
shifts
with
gradual
shifts
in
the
location.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
1881
became
the
focal
point
of
the
controversy,
your
honor.
there
was
no
controverting
evidence
with
respect
to
the
documentary
evidence
showing
the
island
as
early
as
1826.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
so
that's
why
it
became
the
center
of
the
trial
court's
fact
findings.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
no,
the
correct
date
according
to
the
rules
of
this
court
would
be
the
date
the
existence
of
the
island
if
it
were
present
at
the
date
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
or
at
the
date
it
was
formed.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
your
honor,
in
the
trial
court
we
offered
all
of
this
evidence
and
suggested--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--the
theory
in
the
trial
court
focused
on
the
1881
because
of
the
controversy,
but
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
and
the
finding
of
the
trial
court,
the
ultimate
finding
is
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
that
the
applicable
state
entry
date
can
be
under
the
evidence
of
this
case
the
controlling
date.
but
no,
the
principal
focus
of
the
argument
in
the
trial
court
was
the
controversy
in
1881
forward.
now,
the
second
point
relating
to
the
boundary
issue
is
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence,
also
a
fact-intensive
doctrine.
the
trial
court
found
after
a
review
of
the
conflicting
evidence
of
the
experts
that
the
thalweg
lay
on
the
west
side
of
the
island,
and
thus
under
the
thalweg
rule
the
island
was
mississippi
property.
the
trial
court
also
found
based
on
extensive
evidence
that
if
the
trial
court
were
wrong
in
that
finding
that
nevertheless
the
land
were
mississippi
land
because
of
the
doctrine
of
acquiescence.
that
is
of
course
long
assertion
of
dominion,
control,
and
jurisdiction.
so
we
had
two
basic
ultimate
fact
findings.
we
had
innumerable
subsidiary
fact
findings.
we
then
come
to
one
of
the
two
central
points
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
fifth
circuit's
exceeding
the
constraints
of
rule
52
and
according
deference
to
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
correct.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
right.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
the
land
was
patented
as
mississippi
land
and
the
fifth
circuit,
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
was
that
it
was,
the
private
ownership
was
in
the
houston
group.
that
finding
was
reversed
and
renderee
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
both,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
my
counsel
advises
under
louisiana
law
if
it's
louisiana
land
it's
owned
by
the
state.
but
the
focus
of
the
first
of
these
issues
is
then
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
or
standard
under
rule
52
which
this
court
has
given
more
precision
in
anderson
v.
bessemer
city
and
in
amadeo
v.
zant,
and
has
very
clearly
let
it
be
known
that
if
there
are
two
permissible
views
of
the
evidence
that
there
can
virtually
never
be
a
clearly
erroneous
finding
by
the
trial
court,
and
that--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
unquestionably,
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
different
standard.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
i
would
say
that
as
the
case
comes
up
through
the
appellate
court
route
that
the
appellate
courts
are
bound
by
the
erroneous
standard.
if
the
case
comes
to
the
supreme
court
by
the
original
jurisdiction
route,
then
this
court
has
no
constraints
but
it
is
likewise
obligated
to
make
the
fact
findings
required
as
a
matter
of
its
original
jurisdiction.
so
i
see
a
distinction
between
the
standards
of
review
under
the
clearly
erroneous
finding.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
correct.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
correct.
if
that
you
find
from
a
review,
of
course,
that
the
finding
was,
quote,
plausible
or
was,
quote,
permissible.
and
just,
if
i
may
briefly
address
the
court's
attention
to
some
of
the
evidence
that
clearly
indicates
that
the
trial
court's
findings
were
supported.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
if
you
do
that,
then
we
think
that
you
can
do
one
of
two
things.
you
can
dismiss,
in
which
there
is
no
forum.
of
course
this
court
has
already
considered
that
problem
and
made
a
contrary
determination.
but
alternately
you
could
consider
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
based
on
the
record
and
treat
them
as
the
findings
of
a
master
that
you
might
have
appointed.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
i
think
not,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
when
the
case
comes
up
through
the
appellate
route,
and
that's
the
way
this
court
has
mapped
the
route
of
this
case,
then
we
look
at
it
on
a
standard
of
review
based
on
clearly
erroneous,
and
if
the
case
comes
up
through
the
original
jurisdiction
route
you
consider
those
facts
yourself
as
a
matter
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
it
is
conceivable...
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
i
believe
that
to
be
true--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--because
of
the
ownership
of
the
state
unless,
unless
there
is
an
adverse
possession
possibility,
and
i
am
not
certain
whether
the
land
has
been
sufficiently
divested
from
ownership
by
the
state
to
permit
the
adverse
possession
of
the
houston
group
to
mature
title,
even
if
this
is
louisiana
land.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
no,
your
honor,
if
the
private
ownership
were
allowed
to
stand
on
the
basis
of
the
adverse
possession
concept,
then
that
would
be
the
ruling
of
this
court.
but--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--your
honor,
our
position
would
be
that
the
original
action
would
directly
affect
the
ownership
if
you
were
to
at
this
point
in
time--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--thank
you.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
as
we
understood
the
question
it
was
basically
whether
title
and
boundary
were
intertwined,
and
we
believe
that
they
are,
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
boundary
in
louisiana
that
that
would
directly
affect
title,
although
there
is
some--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--well,
because,
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
say
there
is
some
uncertainty
because
of
the
louisiana
ownership
of
the
islands
as
opposed
to
the
fact
that
the
private
owners
houston
have
title
from
the
united
states,
a
patent
from
the
united
states.
but
the
case
was
tried
and
it
appears
to
us
that
title
and
boundary
fall
together.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
if
the
land
is
in
louisiana
then
we
have
no
title
out
of
louisiana,
and
we
may
have
a
possessory
right
if
the
court
were
to
find
some
facts--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--precisely
that,
your
honor.
the
title
is
out
of
the
united
states
covering
mississippi
land.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
well,
that,
your
honor,
is
why
i
qualify
to
say
it's
not
altogether
clear,
and
that's
what's
not
clear.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
because
we
could
not
mature
a
limitation
title
against
a
sovereign
louisiana
by
possession
and
occupancy,
and
we
would
not
have
record
title.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
louisiana
recognizes
title
by
accretion
to
private
land
owners
and
there
would
be
a
fact
question
about
the
private
land
ownership.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes,
you
could
do
that.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
what
we're
saying
there
was
that
we
recognize
that
this
court
could
reconsider
its
1988
decision
to
defer--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
if
that's
the
question
i
was
asked,
then
it's
very
clear.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
if
this
court
were
to
reconsider,
and
we
would
urge
after
of
course
a
very
lengthy
period
of
litigation
that
it
not
do
so,
but
if
it
were
to
do
so
then
we
feel
it
would
be
free,
and
neither
louisiana
nor
mississippi
would
be
bound
by
the
district
court's
decision.
but
as
it
stands--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--we
believe
that
the
title
decision
would
likely
follow
the
determination
of
the
boundary,
but
i
will
have
to
say
that
i'm
not
clear
on
that
and
that
is
frankly
the
best
i
can
do.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
be
left
to
another
day
to
decide
the
title.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
louisiana
brought
mississippi
into
the
case.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
louisiana
brought
mississippi--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--no,
your
honor.
louisiana...
and
that
was
the
third
issue
on
cert,
was
the
third-party
complaint
by
louisiana
against
mississippi
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
you're
referring
to
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
of
the
district
court's
judgment?
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
the
fifth
circuit
judgment.
i'll
have
to
return
to
my
original
answer
that
i
believe
that
the
court,
if
it
were
to
vacate,
would
leave
the
title
question
to
a
later
date
but
that
it
would
have
a
distinct
impact
on
the
title
issue.
perhaps
i
could
put
it
that
way.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
i
believe
that
to
be
correct.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
that's
correct.
there
was
a
motion
to
stay,
your
honor,
and
presumably
the
case
would
have
been
stayed
pending
this
court's
determination
of
that
issue.
this
court
denied
the
motion
to
stay.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
correct.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
if
i
might
just
briefly
address
the
main
point
of
the
support
of
the
findings
of
the
trial
court,
and
this
only
by
way
of
example.
but
we
have
exhibit
which
is
the
original
survey
in
1881
which
is
adverted
to
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
fifth
circuit
which
clearly
shows
the
thalweg
lying
to
the
west
of
stack
island.
we
have
exhibit
8,
which
is
the
expert
testimony
of
austin
smith,
which
locates
the
thalweg
west
of
stack
island.
we
have
the
louisiana
expert,
mr.
easterly,
agreeing,
agreeing
that
this
is
an
appropriate
location
of
the
thalweg.
we
have
the
mississippi
river
commission
on
which
the
fifth
circuit,
which
it
finds
virtually
conclusive,
saying
that
the
objective
was
to
bring
the
thalweg,
or
main
channel
as
it's
called,
back
to
the
west
of
the
island,
and
if
it's
going
to
be
brought
back
obviously
it
has
to
have
been
there
at
some
time.
those
are
examples
that
more
than
demonstrate
the
permissible
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
this
was
mississippi
land.
furthermore,
the
trial
court
buttressed
that
finding
by
the
finding
of
acquiescence,
and
it
made
the
ultimate
finding
very
clearly,
that
if
it
was
wrong
with
respect
to
the
thalweg
it
was
right
with
respect
to
acquiescence
because
there
had
been
taxation
by
mississippi
since
1989,
excuse
me,
1889,
no
taxation
by
louisiana.
there
had
been
foreclosure,
there
had
been
sale,
there
had
been
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
there
had
been
enforcement
of
game
laws,
there
had
been
enforcement
of
criminal
laws,
there
had
been
litigation
in
the
courts,
nothing,
no
litigation
in
the
courts
regarding
this
property,
there
had
been
an
uninterrupted
exercise
of
dominion
and
control.
this
is
a
pure
fact
question,
and
it
is
a
complex
fact
question,
and
the
trial
court
heard
the
evidence
on
it
and
it
made
the
finding.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
disregarded
it
and
it
said
it
was
not
adequate,
but
the
record
itself
will
demonstrate
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
not
correctly
following
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
and
was
ignoring
substantial
record
evidence
that
supported
the
trial
court's
findings.
now,
if
i
may
turn
briefly
to
the
jurisdiction
question,
essentially
this
court
has
held,
as
it
well
knows,
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
decline
under
article
1251(a)
both
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
so
holding.
and
the
cases
and
the
conclusion
of
this
court
that
it
has
jurisdiction,
correctly
based
on
the
fact
that
its
primary
function
should
be
to
act
as
the
supreme
appellate
court
and
that
it
is
ill-equipped
to
make
the
fact
findings
necessary
for
original
jurisdiction.
now,
its
findings
are
consistent
with
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
term
exclusive,
which
is
the
power
to
exclude.
its
findings
have
been
recognized
by
congress,
that
is
its
discretionary
interpretation
of
1251,
so
there
can't
be
a
question
about
that.
now,
louisiana
agrees
essentially
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
louisiana.
it
agrees
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
controversy
by
virtue
of
federal
question
jurisdiction.
now,
where
it
disagrees
is
that
the
district
court
of
mississippi
could
determine
title
to
land
in
louisiana,
but
in
this
respect
louisiana
position
is
inconsistent
because
it
asks
this
court
to
reverse
and
render.
certainly
the
fifth
circuit
could
not
have
had
jurisdiction
if
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
it
does,
your
honor.
it
entered
the
fray
in
the
district
court
and
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
of
mississippi,
having
federal
court,
excuse
me,
federal
question
jurisdiction,
had
the
power
to
decide
the
federal
question
that
gave
it
the
jurisdiction,
and
that
mississippi's
position
that
a
hard
and
fast
exception
to
the
discretion
rule
regarding
boundary
is
not
well
taken.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--yes,
your
honor.
mississippi
opposed
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
mississippi
said
this
court
should
defer
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mississippi
district
court,
and
it
adheres
to
that
position
now.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
first,
as
the
court
can
see,
this
is
a
case
that
is
highly
fact-intensive.
there
is
dispute.
we
dispute
what
mr.
keyser
has
represented
to
the
court
as
the
facts.
obviously
we
can't
get
into
the
entire
record.
the
trial
court
did.
the
nature
of
the
case
as
such
is
to
validate
this
court's
exercise
of
its
writ
of
discretion
to
let
the
facts
be
heard
by
the
trial
court.
secondly,
as
i
pointed
out
to
begin
with,
stack
island
can
be
traced
as
a
separate
body
of
land
from
1826
to
date
by
maps,
aerial
photographs,
and
surveys.
there
was
a
controversy
before
the
trial
court
regarding
the
disappearance
of
the
island.
the
trial
court
made
a
specific
fact
finding
that
this
island,
which
has
migrated
from
the
mississippi
shore
southwesterly
to
the
louisiana
shore,
is
the
same
identical
island
that
existed
during
the
19th
century,
and
that
fact
finding
is
fully
supported
by
the
record.
so--
mr.
james
w.
mccartney
--at
the
joint
appendix
page
98
and
99
our
expert
witness
so
testifies
that
the
island
has
never
disappeared.
it
says
in
place
in
1988
and
remained
in
place
throughout
the
entire
period
and
is
still
there
today.
so
there
was
certainly
evidence
on
which
the
district
court
could
have
rendered
its
fact
finding.
and,
with
respect,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
an
accretion
case
at
all.
this
is
a
case
of
an
island
that
has
migrated
from
one
point
to
another.
migration
out
of
its
original
location
does
not
constitute
disappearance.
we
have
the
same
body
of
land.
we
have
facts
to
support
that
finding.
that
finding
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
thank
you.
