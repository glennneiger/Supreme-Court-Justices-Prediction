mr.
gary
l.
keyser
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
law
do
not
favor
the
petitioners.
the
facts
and
the
law
are
with
louisiana
and
the
louisiana
residents.
the
case
is
one
which
ironically
we
believe
now
has
its
origin
in
the
erroneous
acts
of
a
map
maker
some
20
or
30
years
ago
who
put
a
dotted
line
on
a
map
somewhere
with
the
geological
survey
that
said
indefinite
boundary,
and
it's
on
the
louisiana
bank.
and
seeing
the
indefinite
boundary,
the
petitioners
got
the
idea
that
they
could
move
across
the
mississippi
river
and
claim
land
which
is
within
the
radiating
sections
in
louisiana
patented
out
by
louisiana
to
louisiana
riparians.
i
have
two
exhibits
i'd
like
to
show
you.
the
first
is
louisiana
exhibit
1,
which
is
a
1970
u.s.
geological
survey
map
which
does
indeed
have
the
dotted
line
showing
an
indefinite
boundary.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's
on
page
136.
it's
louisiana
exhibit
1a
from
the
trial
court.
the
indefinite
boundary
runs
along
inland
actually
of
the
louisiana
bank.
the
island
which
petitioners
were
patented
in
1888
based
on
an
1881
survey
is
a
117-acre
island,
shown
here
near
the
east
bank
of
the
river
in
black.
that
island
eroded
downstream
in
a
south--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--yes,
sir,
right
here.
0
[indicating.]
it's
a
little
bitty
figure.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
with
a
black
outline,
yes,
sir.
the
island
eroded
south
and
southwesterly
and
eventually
moved
toward
the
louisiana
bank.
at
the
same
time
the
louisiana
bank
was
being
scoured
westerly
by
the
river
in
a
slight
migration
of
the
river
into
the
louisiana
bank.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
our
expert
calculated
that
and
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
see
because
there
are
two
competing
notions
about
that.
but
our
expert
hatley
harrison
held
that
in
fact
the
remnants
of
what
were
stack
island
some
mile
or
2
to
the
east
against
mississippi
had
completely
eroded
away
by
the
time
the
louisiana
riparian
sections
starting
rebuilding
through
the
accretionary
process.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
no.
no,
there
was
no
contrary
testimony.
the
trial
judge
simply
concluded
that
8
miles
of
accretion
from
above
lake
providence
to
below
the
corner
in
the
reach
of
the
river,
thousands
of
acres,
was
really
no
more
than
the
original
117-acre
stack
island,
less
erosion,
plus
accretion,
but
he
failed
to
consider,
although
all
the
maps
show,
that
the
accretion
which
filled
up
the
louisiana
bank
simply
restored
the
radiating
sections
which
louisiana
patented
out
of
its
state
land
office
over
100
years
ago.
so
the
trial
judge's
theory,
like
the
petitioners',
was
an
island
can
move
laterally
across
the
river
and
grow
and
become
a
part
of
the
bank
in
louisiana
ergo
it's
still
an
island
or
once
was
and
those
remnants
belong
to
the
petitioners.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
first
of
all,
i
have
never
found
a
case
quite
like
this.
i
have
never
heard
of
one
like
this
and
i
have
researched
diligently
trying
to
find
a
similar
example
and
never
have.
it's
not,
it's
not
your
usual
avulsion
case.
the
river
never
left
its
banks
or
bed.
it
never
cut
a
new
bed,
never
cut
through,
never
left
a
cutoff
loop.
it
simply
migrated
a
little
bit
to
the
west
and
then
came
back
to
center
position
again.
it's
a
unique
case
in
that
instance.
also
in
this
la-1
we
see
a
frozen
thalweg
to
the
east
of
stack
island.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
you're
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
friends
think
i
am
being
uppity
when
i
say
that.
[laughter]
i
was
here
in
the
number
9
case,
the
louisiana
tidelands
case,
and
the
number
36
case
and
the
number
86
case,
and
i
have
seen
that
word
before
but
i
am
reluctant
to
say
thalweg.
this
is
another
map
exhibit
which
is
for
illustrative
purposes.
it
shows
the
colors
a
little
bit
more
vividly.
the
river
is
quite
clearly
blue,
the
outline
of
the
1881
location
of
the
island
is
in
yellow.
and
we
see
now...
now
this
is
a
1988
corps
of
engineers
map
from
the
flood
control
and
navigation
series
that
they
put
out
every
year.
we
see
that
the
1881
location
of
the
island
is
now
occupied
by
a
very
large,
huge
really,
island
that
is
midstream
in
the
river
in
the
same
location
as
the
1881
island,
yet
petitioners
continue
to
claim
the
accretion
along
the
west
bank
of
the
river
at
lake
providence.
now,
historically
what
has
happened
here,
and
when
i
began
i
said
the
facts
do
not
favor
mississippi,
that
is
because
in
1879
congress
for
the
first
time
funded
massive
river
construction
projects,
being
the
one
here
at
lake
providence,
at
stack
island
and
at
plum
point
about
100
miles
north.
the
upshot
of
that
was
by
1883,
1884
at
the
conclusion
of
the
project,
the
mississippi
river
commission
reported
to
congress
what
it
had
done.
and
what
it
said
was,
and
it
attached
hydrological
data
in
the
form
of
maps
which
are
in
the
appendix
attached
to
louisiana
exhibit
18a
and
which
are
colored
to
show
the
court
their
importance,
the
mississippi
river
commission
reported
to
congress
that
the
east
chute
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
carried
the
main
channel
of
the
river
in
december
of
1881.
it
was
scouring
the
mississippi
bank,
it
was
threatening
to
erode
the
bank.
the
mississippi
river
commission
saw
as
its
chief
purpose
here
the
object
of
training
the
river
away
from
mississippi
to
keep
it
from
eroding
the
bank.
it
did
that
by
building
a
series
of
dikes
out
of
the
north
end
of
stack
island
and
connecting
to
baleshed
towhead
to
the
north,
so
that
the
river
was
suddenly
diverted
out
of
the
east
chute
channel
to
midstream
position.
that
occurred
by
1883
because
of
the
two
maps
attached
to
louisiana
exhibit
18a--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--they
drove
dikes
into
the
sand
and
drove
them
in
a
northerly
direction
and
connected
them
by
willow
mattresses
so
that
the
river
could
no
longer
flow
directly
behind
the
island.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
to
block
the
east
channel.
it
did
remain
open
for
a
while
as
a
low-water
channel,
but
the
main
current
of
the
river
and
the
downstream
track
of
navigation
was
then
carried
to
the
west
in
more
of
a
midstream
position,
pretty
much
the
way
it
is
today.
in
that
report
the
second
part
of
it
is
that
by
1883
that
act
had
been
accomplished.
so
in
december
of
1881
you
have
the
main
flow
of
the
river
on
the
east
side
of
the
island.
within
a
few
months
it
had
been
diverted
to
the
outside,
toward
the
right
descending
bank,
and
stayed
there
for
about
20
years
before
it
moved
slowly
back
into
that
position.
and
it
stayed
to
the
east
of
the
island
until
the
1970's,
at
which
time,
as
you
see
from
the
1988
map,
the
corps
got
more
heavily
involved
in
construction
projects,
built
dikes
all
along
the
east
side
and
revetments
all
along
the
west
side,
and
has
captured
a
substantial
amount
of
sediment
to
train
the
river
into
a
center
flow
position
and
to
keep
it
from
ambulatory
movement
back
and
forth
between
the
east
and
west
banks.
the
report
to
congress
is
explicit,
it's
clear,
it's
plain
meaning
is
what
i
have
just
told
you.
the
district
judge
disregarded
that.
the
petitioners
expert
disregarded
it.
he
refused
to
answer
questions
about
it
on
cross-examination,
and
he
refused
to
answer
other
questions
about
other
map
exhibits
that
louisiana
produced.
that
report
and
those
maps
are
the
most
conclusive
pieces
of
evidence,
although
we
have
put
in
dozens
of
other
maps
to
show
the
same
story.
the
fifth--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--we
didn't
get
into
the
history
of
the
mississippi
river
commission.
it
was
stipulated
between
counsel
that
it
was
an
authentic
report,
that
it
was
a
government
document,
that
it
indeed
was
reported
to
congress,
and
the
experts
testified.
louisiana's
two
experts,
mr.
harrison
and
dr.
easterly,
testified
from
it.
petitioner's
expert,
mr.
austin
smith,
declined
to
testify
from
it.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
no,
his
version
was
that
what
the
language
really
meant
was
that
the
main
channel
of
the
river
was
always
to
the
right
of
the
island
and
that
there
was
no
avulsion
in
1882-1883
because
the
river
was
always
to
the
right
of
the
island,
which
is
contrary
to
the
plain
reading
of
the
report
itself,
which--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--well,
there
was
no
countervailing
testimony
that
the
report
didn't
say
what
it
plainly
says
except
mr.
smith
said
his
interpretation
was
that
it
meant
the
stream
was,
the
main
body
of
the
stream
was
to
the
right.
our
experts
said
it
said
what
it
said,
and
the
judge
tried
to
get
them
to
admit
maybe
it
meant
something
different
and
they
said
no,
it
means
what
it
says.
and
that's
as
simple
as
it
gets.
the
petitioners
started
off
their
case,
now
both
louisiana
and
mississippi
had
listed
all
of
their
exhibits.
we
started
with
exhibits
more
at
the
time
of
louisiana's
sovereignty
and
mississippi's
sovereignty,
but
mississippi,
being
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
never
used
those
exhibits.
so
we
responded
to
their
case
at
trial,
didn't
put
those
exhibits
on
because
their
theory
at
trial
was
the
river
was
subject
to
two
avulsive
actions
which
they
said
their
expert
austin
smith
would
prove
up,
and
that
they
occurred
sometime
around
1912-1913.
well,
when
mr.
smith
testified
he
only
testified
about
one
avulsion
which
he
claimed
was
due
to
the
flooding
of
1912-1913
which
he
concludes
happened
because
he
has
some
tables
of
river
elevations
of
that
year
which
he
said
demonstrated
a
flood
which
apparently
enlarged
the
chute
channel
to
the
east
of
stack
island,
meaning
that
the
river
boundary
and
the
downstream
track
of
navigation
or
thalweg
would
have
been
frozen
to
the
west
of
the
island.
but
even
mr.
smith
only
said
it
apparently
enlarged
the
chute
channel.
and
when
i
showed
him
maps
prior
to
the
1912-1913
claimed
floods,
i
showed
him
maps
of
1908,
1909,
1911
from
the
u.s.
geological
survey,
that
showed
that
the
channel
was
already
occupied
with
the
main
channel
of
the
river,
the
chute
channel,
he
refused
to
discuss
it.
he
said
the
maps
were
unwholly
and
that
louisiana
must
have
rigged
those
maps
up
or
something
to
that
effect.
so
we
disproved
the
northerly
avulsion
which
he
really
didn't
even
clearly
testify
to,
and
as
to
the
southerly
avulsion,
which
would
have
the
boundary
going
a
couple
of
miles
inland
8
or
9
miles
downstream,
he
had
no
testimony
whatsoever.
then
in
the
fifth
circuit,
after
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
rendered,
the
petitioners
changed
their
theory
to
the
time
of
sovereignty.
certainly
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
error
in
using
the
1881-1882
avulsion
caused
by
the
mississippi
river
commission.
the
fifth
circuit
should
have
looked
to
much
earlier
periods
of
time.
in
our
briefing
we
have
pointed
out
that
in
all
other
periods
of
time
stack
island
didn't
exist
at
the
claimed
relevant
time,
the
time
of
sovereignty
of
either
state,
or
at
any
later
time
until
right
up
just
prior
to
the
mississippi
river
construction
program,
the
cause
being
in
this
reach
of
the
river,
although
the
alignment
is
relatively
straight,
it's
a
reach
of
the
river
that
stores
sediments
from
upstream.
and
you
can
see
even
now
there
is
substantial
amounts
of
sediment
stored.
when
these
become
too
large
i
presume
the
corps
will
allow
them
to
go
downstream
by
removing
some
dikes
and
revetments,
but
this
reach
of
the
river
has
always
had
a
lot
of
movement
of
shoals
and
bars
and
islands.
so
while
stack
island
was
in
existence
prior
to
the
louisiana
sovereignty
in
the
1700's-1800's,
it
disappeared
by
1812,
it
reappeared
in
the
1820's,
it
disappeared
by
the
1850's
and
sixties,
and
it
came
back
in
the
late
1860's.
it
was
a
small
island
near
the
mississippi
shore,
but
it
was
cut
off
from
mississippi
by
the
main
channel
of
the
river,
the
east
chute
channel,
which
the
mississippi
river
commission
sought
to
move
away
from
the
mississippi
bank
and
thence
the
construction
project.
so
louisiana's
position
has
been
that
the
east
chute
channel,
being
avulsively
diverted
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
project,
created
a
frozen
thalweg
to
be
connected
at
the
north
and
at
the
south
to
the
active
downstream
track
of
navigation
or
live
thalweg,
and
that
was
a
position
of
our
experts.
they
clearly
testified
to
that.
we
say
that
the,
at
all
pertinent
times
the
thalweg
was
east
of
the
island.
there
never
was
a
time
favorable
to
mississippi.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
must
reluctantly
admit
that
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction.
i
didn't
like
it.
i
told
the
court
that--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--that...
if
you
hold
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction?
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
you
must
hear
the
case
and
decide
it
yourself.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
the
boundary
must
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
because
petitioners
are
claiming
riparian
sections
of
land
which
have
historically
been
in
louisiana
in
a
different
land
district
than
the
mississippi
land
district.
that's
the
ultimate
question,
and
that's
why
we
intervened,
because
mississippi
people
had
sued
louisiana
riparians
and
a
state
agency
on
the
west
bank
claiming
adverse
possession.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
have
only
done
that
recently,
and
i
have
looked
through
the
law
and
find
no
exception
to
the
district
court
having
jurisdiction.
all
the
cases
i
find
say
that
even
though
i
don't
like
it
and
even
though
i
say
the
district
court
had
to
predetermine
its
jurisdiction
and
thence
the
outcome
of
the
case
before
it
even
heard
the
first
witness,
nonetheless
as
a
matter
of
jurisdictional
finality
they
did
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
would
say
it's
because
of
the
jurisprudence
in
the
orders
of
this
court
declining
to
take
jurisdiction
itself,
thereby
giving
the
district
court
the
suitable
alternative
forum,
implicit
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
determine
all
issues.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
no,
sir,
i
moved
for
it
twice.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
only
that
the
district
court
must
then
be
vested
with
sufficient
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
determine
all
issues.
implicit
in
that
ruling
would
be
that
the
court
had
found
that
to
be
the
suitable
alternative
forum
beside
the
supreme--
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
--as
a
practical
matter
it
certainly
does.
i
don't
know
as
a
technical
legal
matter
whether
or
not
it
does.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
don't
know
how
the
court
could
have
reached
that
conclusion.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
because
of
the
interstate
boundary
issue
i
made
a
rather
concerted
effort
to
point
out
that
this
case
did
deal
with
an
interstate
boundary,
that
it
involved
the
treaty
of
paris,
that
it
involved
acts
of
congress,
that
it
involved
statutes
of
the
united
states,
and
i
did
everything
i
could
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
that.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
well,
in
our
view
if
the
boundary
is
drawn
in
its
proper
place
all
of
the
lands
at
issue
remain
in
louisiana
as
they
were
patented
out,
thereby
the
only
claim
that
the
mississippi
people
would
have
would
be
one
of
adverse
possession
or
acquiescence,
and
they
certainly
can't
prove
either
of
those.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
would
agree
with
that.
our
port
commission
is
faced
with
the
possibility
that
it
no
longer
has
water
frontage
because
of
the
boundary
drawn
by
petitioner's
expert,
and
the
riparian
owners
from
above
lake
providence
to
below
lake
providence
no
longer
have
river
frontage
and
they
are
cut
off
somewhere
a
quarter
of
a
mile
inland
from
the
river.
those
are
all
issues.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
l.
keyser
i
certainly
could.
i
hadn't
intended
to.
the
greater
preponderance
of
all
witness
evidence
and
all
documentary
evidence
is
with
louisiana
simply
because
the
louisiana
riparians
have
lived
on
the
louisiana
side
of
the
river
and
gone
to
the
water's
edge
since
the
time
of
their
titles.
we
had
the
very
elderly
widow
of
the
former
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
who
lives
in
lake
providence
down
in
this
area,
in
fact
on
la
exhibit
1,
her
name
is
mrs.
vail
delony
and
you
will
see
two
straight
lines
drawn
out
to
the
water's
edge
and
the
name
delony
written
in
there.
mrs.
delony
and
her
daughter,
mrs.
reed,
both
testified
that
from
the
early
part
of
this
century
their
family
has
lived
there,
mined
sand
and
gravel
there,
hunted
there.
they
never
have
seen
any
mississippi
people
there.
and
all
of
the
other
witnesses
i
called,
and
i
have
to
tell
you
the
trial
judge
didn't
like
some
of
my
witnesses.
i
called
the
united
states
fish
and
wildlife
field
agent
who
is
known
all
over
the
united
states
although
he's
a
relatively
young
man
in
his
thirties,
he
has
exercised
jurisdiction
all
over
the
accreted
area
since
he
has
been
assigned
to
this
area
and
said
he
never
saw
any
mississippi
people.
he
said
he
wrote
all
his
game
violations
and
took
them
to
federal
court
in
louisiana.
then
i
called
several
louisiana
wildlife
and
fisheries
people
and
they
said
the
same
thing.
they
had
grown
up
there,
exercised
louisiana
wildlife
authority.
they
never
saw
any
mississippi
people
there,
wrote
all
their
violations
under
louisiana
law
and
federal
law,
and
took
them
all
to
court
in
monroe
and
shreveport.
every
witness
that
we
called
said
that
they
had
never
seen
any
mississippi
people
here.
as
a
practical
matter
i
know
that
there
were
people
from
mississippi
hunting
deer
out
here
at
different
times
because
there
was
some
testimony
to
that
effect,
but
it
was
not
generally
recognized
that
they
were
mississippi
people
exercising
adverse
possession.
now
as
to
the
acquiescence
argument
there
is
no
testimony
or
evidence
of
which
i
am
aware
that
as
a
sovereign
either
state
dealt
with
this
area.
certainly
louisiana
never
recognized
the
sovereignty
of
mississippi
here.
there
was
not
one
single
witness
to
say
that
mississippi
exercised
sovereignty
here.
we
had
such
colorful
witnesses
as
jelly
higgins
and
horsefly
higgins
for
the
petitioners,
who
were
their
main
witnesses.
now,
jelly
and
horsefly
said
they
were
acts
of
adverse
possession
out
here,
but
i
didn't
think
it
was
good,
strong
evidence
myself
and
i
pointed
that
out
to
the
court.
and
i
have
to
say
whenever
you
have
a
serious
case
in
federal
court
if
those
are
your
strongest
witnesses
you've
got
a
problem.
and
that's
my
view
of
acquiescence.
are
there
any
questions?
thank
you.
