unknown
speaker
if
that's
so,
why
is
it
that
1881
became
the
relevant
date
for
the
district
court's
inquiry?
why
shouldn't
it
have
been
where
the
thalweg
was
at
the
time
when
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it--
unknown
speaker
--was
it...
and
you
contend
that
that's
the
correct
date
to
focus
upon?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
argued
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
offered
it
all,
but
was
your
theory
in
the
trial
court
that
the
date
of
admission
to
the
union
was
the
critical
date,
and
that
you
tried
to
find
out
from
the
best
evidence
available
what
the
situation
was
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccartney,
would
you
clarify
a
couple
of
things
for
me
with
respect
to
what
the
fifth
circuit
did?
i
guess
there
were
two
basic
questions.
one,
who
owned
the
particular
land,
was
it
the
houston
group
or
the
state
of
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
the
second
question
is
was
the
land
at
issue
located
in
mississippi
or
louisiana,
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
did
the
fifth
circuit,
do
you
think,
did
its
judgment
have
any
effect
on
the
ownership
dispute
as
opposed
to
the
state
boundary
question?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
did?
unknown
speaker
now,
are
you
here
representing
the
houston
group
or
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
both.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccartney,
do
you
think
that
rule
necessarily
applies
in
the
case
in
which
at
least
some
people
might
have
thought
belonged
in
this
court
in
the
first
place?
you
know,
we
have
original
jurisdiction
of
controversies
between
two
states.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
we
might
have
a
little
broader
authority
to
review
the
fact
finding
that
underlies
the
decision
of
such
a
controversy?
unknown
speaker
so
that
we
may
not
be
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
unknown
speaker
you
think
we
are
bound
by
it?
unknown
speaker
depending
upon
how
it
gets
here,
you
say.
unknown
speaker
but
this
one
has
gotten
here
not
through
original
jurisdiction--
unknown
speaker
--and
so
you
say
we
would
be
bound
by
what
the
district
court
found?
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
would
you
clarify
for
us
what
if
we
think
that
only
this
court
can
determine
the
boundary
dispute,
this
court
and
no
other,
that
the
district
court
could
not
decide
that
question,
what
do
we
do
now?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
third
alternative
of
vacating
any
decision
on
the
boundary
but
then
dealing
separately
with
the
question
of
who
owns
the
land?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccartney,
may
i
put
the
question,
i
don't
know
if
justice
o'connor
had
this
in
mind
but
just
a
slightly
different
version
of
her
question.
is
it
conceivable
that
the
ruling
on
ownership
is
not
dependent
on
the
ruling
on
where
the
boundary
is?
unknown
speaker
yes.
obviously
it's
conceivable,
but
in
this
case
do
both
parties
feel
that
one
cannot
answer
the
ownership
question
without
first
answering
the
boundary
line
question?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
that
you
would
fear,
i
guess,
the
precedential
or
the
res
judicata
effect
if
we
allowed
the
private
ownership
determination
to
stand
and
vacated
with
respect
to
the
sovereignty
issue
between
the
two
states?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
be
your
position
if
we
vacated
and
allowed
an
original
action
as
between
the
two
states
on
their
controversy?
unknown
speaker
so
the
original
action
would
not,
would
not
be
subject
to
res
judicata
is
what
you're
saying?
why
don't
you
answer
that
at
1:00,
mr.
mccartney.
we'll
recess
until
then.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
question?
would
you
repeat
the
question?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
still
haven't
told
me
why.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
you
don't
have
any
title
out
of
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
it's
in
louisiana?
how
would
that
cancel
out
your
title
from
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
argument
that
your
title
would
be
affected
if
it's
in
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
mean
adverse--
--adverse
possession.
unknown
speaker
but
does
louisiana
recognize
the
doctrine
of
accretion
and
avulsion
that,
you
know,
title
may
change
depending
upon
whether
a
switch
in
a
river
thalweg
was
sudden
or
gradual?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
we
said
that
the
title
issue
should
have
been
that
we
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
boundary
issue,
then
we
could,
couldn't
we,
if
we
decided
it
that
way
couldn't
we
remand
to
the
courts
below
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
we
took
the
boundary
issue
here
could
be,
can
be
disassociated
with
the
title
issue?
unknown
speaker
because
i
would
think
that
the
courts
below
could,
would
know
more
about
that
than
we
do.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccartney,
i
thought
it
was
your,
frankly
i'm
surprised
to
hear
what
you've
said.
i
thought
it
was
your
position,
i
gathered
from
footnote
14
of
your
brief
that
mississippi
would
remain
free
to
litigate
the
boundary
issue
even
if
we
decided
we
had
no
jurisdiction,
if
we
decided
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
question.
that's
what
it
says.
it
says
a
holding
that
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
of
a
third-party
complaint
against
mississippi
would
require
vacation
of
the
judgment
against
the
state
and
leave
mississippi
free
to
litigate
the
boundary
issue
anew.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
might
concede--
unknown
speaker
--right.
and
suppose
we
do
that?
i
thought
that
was
the
question
you
were
being
asked.
suppose
we
do
that,
isn't
mississippi
then
free
to
relitigate
the
boundary
issue?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
misunderstood
it.
unknown
speaker
although
the
title
decision
would
stand.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
wouldn't...
if
we
granted,
if
we
granted
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
an
original
action
it
would
just
deal
with
the
boundary,
i
suppose.
we
wouldn't
be
deciding
title.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
if
louisiana
had
never
intervened
into
this
case
mississippi
could
have
remained
in
it
and
litigated
the
title.
unknown
speaker
oh,
oh.
unknown
speaker
mississippi
wasn't
a
party
at
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
agree
that
mississippi
would
be
equally
free
to
litigate
the
boundary
issue--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
vacate
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
boundary
issue
but
we,
for
whatever
reason,
do
not
disturb
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
title
issue,
the
private
title
issue?
unknown
speaker
yes,
the
fifth
circuit
judgment.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
i
think
you're
saying
that
we
could
not
consistently
vacate
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
boundary
and
leave
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
private
title
as
it
is,
as
the
fifth
circuit
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
i
take
it
that
if
in
the
first
instance
we
had
decided
to
permit
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
exercised
our
original
jurisdiction
the
private
parties
would
not
have
been
parties
to
that
aspect
of
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
unusual
that
boundary
determinations
which
determine
where
property
is
are
conclusive
of
many
private
claims--
unknown
speaker
--whether
or
not
those
private
owners
are
represented
in
the
boundary
dispute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccartney,
is
your
position
on
the
jurisdictional
point
that
you're
asserting,
is
that
the
position
of
both
the
private
client
you
represent
and
also
of
the
state
of
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
mississippi
acknowledges
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
it
for
purposes
of
the
boundary
dispute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccartney,
before
you
reserve,
what
you
have
just
told
me
is
again
contrary
to
what
your
brief
says.
the
footnote
14
of
your
brief
says
that
mississippi
believes
that
what
it
said
in
1988
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
determine
the
boundary
dispute
was
correct
and
it
adheres
to
that
position
now.
does
it
adhere
to
that
now
or
doesn't
it
adhere
to
that
now?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
mccartney.
mr.
keyser,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
duplicate
of
something
we
have
in
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
shown
in
black?
unknown
speaker
so,
with
black,
with
a
black
outline?
unknown
speaker
did
it
ever
wash
away
completely
or
did
this
sort
of
land
mass
just
slowly
move?
unknown
speaker
and
was
there
contrary
testimony?
in
other
words
was
there
evidence
on
that
score
from
which
the
trial
judge
could
have
gone
either
way?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
clear
law
on
the
application
of
the
thalweg
island
exception
in
an
instance
in
which
the
original
island
disappears,
as
you
claim
this
one
did?
unknown
speaker
mr.
keyser,
i
think
that
word
is
pronounced
thalweg.
i
know
it
has
been
pronounced
thalweg
by
everybody
who
has
spoken.
i
have
checked
it
in
a
couple
of
dictionaries.
it's
based
on
the
old
german
word
thal,
which
is
the
word
for
a
valley,
and
that's
pronounced
thal
i
think,
not
thal.
unknown
speaker
how
was
that
diversion
accomplished?
unknown
speaker
to
block
the
east
channel?
unknown
speaker
were
you
able
to
authenticate
that
report
in
any
way
other
than
as
an
official
document
as
to
just
what
efforts
had
been
put
in
and
what
the
qualifications
of
the
people
on
the
commission
were?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
express
doubt
as
to
its
correctness?
unknown
speaker
was...
might
not
the
district
court
have
been
free
to
discount
the
usefulness
of
the
report?
i
mean,
was
he
obligated
to
take
it?
you
suggest,
it
seems
to
me,
almost
like
a
stipulation.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
keyser,
what
is
your
position
if
this
court
determines
that
the
lower
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
determine
boundaries
between
the
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
might
not
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
boundary?
the
title
dispute?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basis
upon
which
you
conceded
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction?
on
what
theory?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
of
the
presence
of
third
parties
or
because
of
the
order
of
this
court,
or
both?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
you
don't
contest
that
we
could
have
taken
original
jurisdiction
if
we
had
chosen
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
we
didn't
take
it,
you
say
that
was
a
judgment
of
ours?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'd
say
implicit
in
the
ruling
is
that
the
judges
that
voted
that
way
probably
thought
that,
but
does
it
have
the
force
of
a
judgment
of
this
court
that
there
is
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
at
least
theoretically
possible,
maybe
this
isn't
what
the
majority
was
actually
thinking
then,
but
that
the
court
might
have
thought
that
the
title
issue
could
have
been
resolved
without
resolving
the
boundary
issue
and
that
the
district
court
was
an
adequate
forum
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
lots
of
times
the
ownership
of
land
could
be
in
the
same
party
even
though
he
thinks
he's
in
mississippi
when
in
fact
he
turns
out
to
be
in
a
different
jurisdiction.
i
think
at
least
analytically
they
are,
they
could
be
regarded
as
separate
issues.
maybe
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case
after
you
get
into
it.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
any
of
that
would
be
conclusive
on
the
question
whether
the
boundary
issue
would
also
necessarily
determine
the
title
issue.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
maybe
it
is,
i
just
don't
know,
understand
it
well
enough.
unknown
speaker
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
suppose
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible,
isn't
it,
that
a
mississippi
citizen
could
acquire
land
in
louisiana
by
adverse
possession?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
to
the
state
who
owns
it,
does
it,
so
long
as
the
state
has
sovereignty
over
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that,
of
course,
and
that
pertains
to
the
title,
not
to
the
boundary?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
address
the
acquiescence
aspect
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
keyser.
mr.
mccartney,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what...
was
there
specific
testimony
on
your
behalf
that
the
original
island
had
not
disappeared
and
reappeared,
but
had
enjoyed
a
continuity,
a
physical
continuity
throughout
the
period?
