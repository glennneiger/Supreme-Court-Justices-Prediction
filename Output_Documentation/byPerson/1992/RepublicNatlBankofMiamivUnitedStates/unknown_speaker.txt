unknown
speaker
notwithstanding
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
beiley,
what
about
cases
like
the
brig
ann
where
the
court
has
stated
that
the
release
of
the
res
ends
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
for
example
if
a
third
party
absconds
with
the
res,
what
happens
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beiley,
you
would
say
that
even
in
the
old
admiralty
cases,
i
think
you
would
say
this,
that
if
the
case
had
already
been
decided
by
the
district
court
and
was
on
appeal,
as
it
is
here,
and
at
that
point
somebody
absconded
with
the
ship,
the
appeal
would
have
proceeded,
even
in
old
admiralty
cases.
wouldn't
you
say
that?
do
we
have
a
case
where
that
was
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
the
old
admiralty
cases
are
no
different
from
what
you
would
say
should
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that
they
shouldn't
have
any
relevance.
why
shouldn't
they
have
any
relevance?
doesn't
congress,
isn't
our
normal
rule
that
congress
enacts
against
the
background
of
the
common
law
and
we
interpret
their
statutes
against
that
background?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
the
money
in
this
case
wasn't
in
the
bank
or
in
some
place
but
it
was
in
a
bag
and
somebody
stole
it,
i
suppose
then
that
would
be,
the
court
of
appeals
could
dismiss
the
case?
unknown
speaker
after
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
under
your
view
the
language
in
the
rio
grande
was
really
quite
unnecessary
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
jurisdiction
remained
if
the
res
was
removed
by
some
improper
action
or
by
accident
or
by
fraud?
that
was
just
quite
unnecessary
under
your
view
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
the
court
have
qualified
its
language
then
to
say
that
accidental
or
improper
removal?
it
would
just
say
that
any
transfer
of
the
res,
any
relinquishment
or
any
disappearance
of
the
res
suffices.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
still
not
quite
sure
what
your
explanation
is
for
the
accidental,
fraudulent,
or
improper
removal
language.
it
seems
to
me
those
are
quite
unnecessary
qualifications.
under
your
view
the
rio
grande
court
should
have
said
and
any
subsequent
removal
by
the
res
is
insufficient
to
destroy
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
didn't
the
government
make
some
agreement
with
the
bank
early
on--
unknown
speaker
--that
they
would
not,
that
they
could
foreclose
but
they
wouldn't,
they
would
hold
the
proceeds
subject
to
the
bank's
lien?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
they
ever
get
the
proceeds
out
of
the
court
registry?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
you
think
whatever
they,
you
don't
think
there
was
an
agreement
then
with
the
bank
that
they
would
hold
the
proceeds?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
rely
on
any
agreement
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would,
if
it
was
sort
of
a
breech
of
faith
by
the
government
you
would
certainly
be
relying
on
it.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
deal
in
your
oral
argument,
mr.
beiley,
with
the
government's
appropriations
clause
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
the
money
that
you're
talking
about
basically
was
remitted
to
the
treasury,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
arguable
at
least
that
congress
drew
a
distinction,
that
there
are
different
funds
that
government
deposits
are
housed
in
and
once
it
goes
into
the
treasury
it's
subject
to
this
appropriations
clause
limitation
that
it
wouldn't
be
subject
to
if
it
simply
remained
in
a
different
account.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute.
but
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
that
money
is
fungible,
that
it's
an
intangible,
cuts
against
your
appropriation
arguments.
you
were
the,
you
began
by
saying
that
oh,
this
is
not,
i
assume
you
meant
this
is
not
public
money.
the
title
is
contested
to
this.
but
the
minute
you
say
that
it's
simply
an
accounting
entry
that
is
fungible
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
weakens
your
argument
under
the
appropriations
clause.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
1301(d)
that
says
a
law
may
be
construed
to
make
an
appropriation
only
if
the
law
specifically
states
that
an
appropriation
is
made?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
is
language
of
specific
appropriation?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
this
hadn't
been
treated
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
the
case
against
the
government
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
funds
were
then
in
the
treasury
or
not.
the
government
would
have
to
pay
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
so
it,
it
really
doesn't
make...
even
if
they
had
transferred
the
money
they
might
have
to
pay
a
judgment,
just
like
the
government
has
to
pay
judgments
a
lot
of
times.
unknown
speaker
when
they
lose
a
tax
case
sometimes
they
have
to--
[laughter]
mr.
beiley,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of,
well
just
a
question?
do
you
understand
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
taking
the
position
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
it
either,
if
it
were
moot
we
ought
to
vacate
the
judgment
below,
would
be
the
normal
disposition,
and
then
you'd
get
your
money
back.
that's
our
normal
disposition
with
moot
cases,
and
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
your
understanding
is
or
what
their
understanding
is
of
the
mootness
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
thinking
that
their
theory
was
taking
the
res
out
of
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district
rendered
the
case
non-justiciable
or
moot,
which
would
be
true
if
the
plaintiff
were
still
trying
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
res,
but
this
is
the
opposite
here.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
vacate
it
you,
it
seems
to
me...
i
suppose
i
should
ask
government
counsel
this
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
a
bond,
doesn't
the
supersedeas
bond
ordinarily
provide
not
just
to
secure
the
principal
but
interest
as
well
for
damages
for
a
delay,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
just
holding
the
property
as
the
government
does
would
not
allow
it
necessarily
to
recover
those
elements.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
really
care
whether
they
move
it
to
the
treasury
or
not
as
long
as
you
get
your
appeal.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
win
the
case
you
would
think
the
government
would
pay
you.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
say
the
constitution
guarantees
you
the
right
to
appeal,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
got
it
by
statute,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
certainly
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal
where
some
event
occurs
that
simply
causes
there
no
longer
to
be
a
case
or
controversy,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
why
wouldn't
the
same,
why
wouldn't
the
same
answer
be
given
if
indeed
the
problem
here
is
that
the
lower
court
can
no
longer
enforce
its
judgment?
why--
unknown
speaker
--enter
what?
a
judgment
against
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
two
statutes
that
you're
relying
on
for
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
of
course
not
an
appropriation,
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
issue
between
you
and
the
government
about
the
right
to
have
your
lien
recognized?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
claiming
to
be
an
innocent
owner?
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
found
against
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
wanted
to
litigate
that
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
the
two
statutes
you
rely
on
are
not
appropriations.
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
in
effect
that
the
statute
assume,
or
those
statutes
on
my
assumption,
those
statutes
presuppose
that
the
government
will
not
have
put
the
money
in
the
treasury
and
therefore
the
deposit
in
the
treasury
would
be
a
mistake
and
therefore
legally
they
would
not
be
subject
to
the
appropriations
clause.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they're
in
the
treasury
why
aren't
the
statutes
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
the
appropriations
clause?
unknown
speaker
if
they
are
properly
in
the
treasury,
strike
that.
if
they
are
properly
in
the
treasury
why
aren't
the
statutes
in
excess
of
congressional
power
and
in
violation
of
the
appropriations
clause?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
contrary
to
my
assumption.
i
said
if
we
assume
they
are
not
appropriations,
justice
scalia's
question,
then
do
you
lose?
and
you're
telling
me
why
you
don't.
but
i
think
what
you're,
as
i
understand
it
what
you're
telling
me
is
that
they
could
not
be
regarded
as
appropriations...
i'm
sorry,
that
they,
that
the
funds
could
not
be
regarded
as
properly
in
the
treasury
because
their
transfer
to
the
treasury
was
mistaken.
unknown
speaker
you
contend
that
if
you
get
a
judgment
on
appeal
permitting
the
entry
by
the
district
court
of
an
order
for
return
of
a
property
that
this
would
constitute
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute
the
compromise
of
a
valid
lien
or
mortgage
against
property
that
has
been
forfeited?
that's
a
very
strange
way
to--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
not
a
mortgage
against
the
property.
you're
saying
you
want
a
judgment
for
return,
you
want
a
judgment
for
money
out
of
the
treasury.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
beiley.
mr.
long,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
long,
can
i
ask
you
right
at
that
point
what
was
the,
was
there
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
notice
of
appeal
was
taken,
which
as
i
understand
it
was
prior
to
the
transfer
of
the
res?
unknown
speaker
the
jurisdiction
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
then.
and
supposing
the
transfer
had
been
made
after
the
opinion
was
announced
but
before
the
mandate
went
down?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
transfer
were
not
made
when
it
was
in
this
case
but
after
the
case
had
been
argued
and
the
court
had
deliberated
on
the
case
and
announced
from
the
bench
they
were
going
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
other
side,
but
the
mandate
had
not
gone
down,
and
then
you
transferred?
unknown
speaker
no,
a
mandate
is
not
the
court's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
see,
i
was
always
under
the
impression
that
the
jurisdictional
act
for
vesting
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
filing
the
notice
of
appeal.
i
thought
as
long
as
there
was
a
controversy
between
the
parties
the
court
of
appeals
would
retain
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
strongest
case
to
the
contrary
of
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
the
appellate
court's
jurisdiction
was
defeated
by
a
transfer
after
the
appellate
court
had
acquired
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
any
greater
injustice
than
this,
if
they
are
right
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
were
right
on
the
merits
there
was
an
injustice.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--what
did
the,
did
the
district
court
do
something
affirmatively
to
release
the
funds
other
than
just
enter
the
judgment
for
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
mr.
long,
if
contrary
to
the
facts
in
this
case
the
government
had
had
custody
of
the
funds
during
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court,
say
by
agreement
of
the
parties
or
something
you
put
it
in
an
interest
bearing
account
and
during
the
pendency
of
those
proceedings
the
government
improperly
transferred
the
funds
to
the
treasury,
your
position
would
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
the
government
lawyer
would
be
in
hot
water,
we'll
accept
that,
but
your
position
would
be
the
same
on
the,
on
mooting,
in
effect
mooting
the
case
by
loss
of
the
res,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case
for
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
whenever
the
appropriations
clause
is
involved
the
so-called
injustice
exception
is
simply
unavailable?
unknown
speaker
is
there
no
cause
of
action,
i
mean
there
are
appropriations
for
the
payments
of
judgments
rendered
by
the
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act
and
under
other
legislation.
is
there
such
a
big
hole
in
our
judicial
system
that
the
government
skips
off
with
this
money
and
there's
no
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's
a
gap
if
the
government
is
sitting
on
money
that
it
really
shouldn't
have.
you
would
acknowledge...
let's
assume
that
the
judgment
below
was
wrong,
should
have
been
reversed
on
appeal,
the
government
has
money
that
it
shouldn't
have.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
i
consider
this
an
unjust
enrichment
of
the
government.
unknown
speaker
if
we
reversed
the
district
court
order
by
munsingware
the
case,
just
set
it
aside,
take
you
at
your
word
and
say
there's
no
longer
any
jurisdiction
in
the
courts,
since
there
isn't
the
case
is
moot,
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
for
return
of
the
money
under
any
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
a
separate
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
you
have
to
sustain
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction
before
you
even
get
to
the
appropriations
clause
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
retained
jurisdiction
rightly
in
this
case
and
yet
the
money
was
gone,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
you
lost
the
case
and
they
entered
judgment
against
the
united
states.
i
suppose
the
united
states
is
always
getting
judgments
entered
against
it
which
they
have
to
pay.
unknown
speaker
so
you
agree
then
that
you
must,
the
appropriations
clause
cannot,
cannot
finish
this
case
without
your
winning
the
jurisdictional
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can't
imagine...
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
and
could
decide
against
you,
you're
going
to
pay
the
judgment,
no
matter
where
the
money
is.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
you
have
to
convince
us
first
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
and
contrary-wise
congress
passes
a
bill
appropriating
money
to
pay
judgments
rendered
against
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
the
case?
in
an
in
personam
jurisdiction
the
court
acquires
jurisdiction
because
it
has
the
body
of
the
defendant,
right,
and
it
can
exercise
control
over
them.
if
he
leaves
the
jurisdiction
we
don't
say
oh,
god,
he's
gone
now,
the
court
can't
do
anything
so
the
case
is
over.
why
should
it
be
any
different
for
in
rem
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
by
a
particular--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
you've
got
your
parties
reversed.
the
plaintiff
has
to
satisfy
the
judgment
out
of
the
res.
the
government
is
the
plaintiff
here.
it
couldn't
of
course
satisfy
a
judgment
if
the
res
went
elsewhere.
but
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
satisfy
any
judgment
out
of
the
res,
he's
just
to
keep
what
he
owns.
unknown
speaker
what
should
the
amount
of
the
bond
have
been
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
would
that
have
preserved
jurisdiction
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
bond
was
less
than
the
amount
of
the
forfeited
proceeds,
suddenly
you
have
solved
what
you
consider
to
be
the
jurisdictional
defect?
unknown
speaker
so
the
amount,
the
amount
of
the
bond
need
not
be
the
amount
of
the
res,
and
yet
the
res
is
now
constructively,
i
take
it,
before
the
court
simply
because
a
bond
for
costs
has
been
posted?
unknown
speaker
well
how
would
that
satisfy
your
concerns
under
the
appropriations
clause?
unknown
speaker
but
you
also
agree
if
by
some
hook
or
crook
you
had
your
hands
on
the
property
and
the
court
did
not
in
my
hypo
and
you
were
investing
it
by
agreement,
a
bond
could
have
been
filed
and
if
you
then
improperly
transferred
it
to
the
treasury
you're
going
to
be
making
the
same
argument
you're
making
today.
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
attorney
general
exercise
his
discretion?
you
mean
in
violation
of
the
appropriations
clause?
unknown
speaker
for
you,
but
not
for
the
other
side,
you
say.
i
mean,
you
say
that
they
can't
use
it
but
the
attorney
general
can
use
it.
unknown
speaker
you
would
acknowledge
then
that
if
this
case
came
out
against
the
government
that
he'd
be
able
to
use
that
same
fund
to
find
the
money
to
pay
the
claimants
here,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that
it
is
the
discretionary
character
of
the
attorney
general's
act
that
defeats
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
appropriations
clause
apply
simply
to
public
monies?
why
are
these
public
monies
if
the
title
to
them
is
contested?
unknown
speaker
but
you
were
identifying
the
funds
in
an
almost
quasi
physical
sense.
you
were
saying
once
something
is
in
the
treasury
it
is
entirely
beside
the
point
of
the
appropriations
clause
whether
it
was
proper
to
transfer
it
there
or
not,
and
the
point,
i
think
the
point
of
justice
kennedy's
question
is
isn't
there
some
concept
of
what
ought
or
ought
not
to
be
in
the
treasury
that
should
be
applied
before
the
appropriations
clause
argument
would
be
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
government
officials
steal
money,
if
government
officials
overcharge
taxpayers
and
so
on,
knowingly
and
fraudulently,
and
the
money
gets
in
the
treasury
that's
it,
subject
to
the
appropriations
clause?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
right
there,
on
the
rio
grande
case
that
was
jurisdiction
to
grant
a
judgment
to
the
libellot,
not
to
the
libelee.
are
there
any
cases
where
the
jurisdiction,
where
you
have
the
same
status
of
the
parties
that
you
have
in
this
case,
where
it's
the
defendant
who
is
claiming
there
is
still
power
to
correct
an
erroneous
judgment?
unknown
speaker
for
what
purpose?
jurisdiction
for
purpose
of--
unknown
speaker
--but
not
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
merits
of
the
dispute
that
the
government
had
initiated.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
you
don't
have
a
single
united
states
supreme
court
case
that
supports
the
first
proposition
you
are
advancing
here.
there's
no
case
that's
on
all
fours
with
the
position
here.
unknown
speaker
the
rio
grande
would
support
you
if
they
had
taken
the
money
away
from
the
district
court
before
you
got
your
judgment,
and
you
would
be
absolutely
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
long,
are
you
simply
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
without
jurisdiction
period,
or
are
you
saying
that
this
case
is
actually
moot?
unknown
speaker
supposing
in
this
case
that
the
bank
had
simply
failed
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
without
jurisdiction,
the
case
would
have
been
over,
yet
no
one
would
have
suggested
the
case
was
moot.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say,
you
do
not
say
the
case
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
then,
you
would
come
out
the
same
way
if
a
ship
sitting
in
port
were
the
subject
of
the
action
and
the
government
wins
and
it
just,
it's
a
hotly
contested-case
and
then
the
government
just
sails
the
ship
away.
the
former
owner
of
the
ship
can't
do
a
thing
about
it?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
it
can
do
that
if
the
ship
is
gone?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
the
ship
has
gone
to
south
america
but
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
removal
was
absolutely
fraudulent.
now,
what's
it
going
to
do?
unknown
speaker
against
whom?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
against
the
person
who
illegally
removed
it?
unknown
speaker
the
owner
of
the
ship
only
because
the
district
court
ruled
that
it
was
forfeitable.
unknown
speaker
was
the
united
states
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
you
say
if
it
were,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
we
have
judgment,
we
have
jurisdiction
here
because
we
think
the
government
illegally
removed
the
funds?
let's
assume
there
had
been
a
stay
which
the
government
did
not
observe.
but
the
money
is
in
the
treasury.
so
what
does
the
court
of
appeals
do?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
that,
but
what
does
it
do
against
the...
can
the
court
of
appeals
then
issue
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
which
would
be
satisfied
in
the
normal
course?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
exception
for
illegal
government
action
in
removing
the
res?
unknown
speaker
so
even
putting
up
a
stay
in
a
supersedeas
bond
would
not
have
guaranteed
the
bank
a
right
to
have
its
appeal
heard
here
if
the
government
chose
to
disregard
the
stay?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
told
justice
white
it
didn't
make
any
difference,
that
the
court
of
appeals
still
had
no
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
your
first
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
of
appeals
could
enter
judgment
against
the
government
on
the
merits,
very
likely
a
judgment
like
that
could
have
been
satisfied
out
of
the
judgments
fund,
might
it
not,
without
having
to
violate
the
appropriations
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
wait--
--there's
no,
you
admitted
there's...
no
case
like
this
has
ever
come
up
before
in
this
court.
we
don't
have
to
overrule
a
single
case
to
disagree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
case
is
like
this
one
that
you
can
cite?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
closest,
and
that's
where
they
could
not
have
recovered,
not...
it's
the
exact
opposite
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
beiley,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what
is
supposed
to
happen
then?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
care
whether
you
were
asking
for
the
return
of
the
specific
funds
or
not,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
think
you
need
the
consent
of
the
government
to
have
a
judgment
like
that
entered?
