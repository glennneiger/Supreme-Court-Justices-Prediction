mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
over
an
appeal
when
the
district
court
has
entered
a
final
judgment
of
forfeiture
in
an
in
rem
proceeding,
the
final
judgment
has
not
been
stayed
and
the
res
has
been
released
from
the
district
court's
control
and
deposited
in
the
united
states
treasury.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
we
would
say
yes,
at
that
point
the
res
was
still--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
if
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
the
mandate
would
be
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
the
mandate
would
be
the
court's
decision.
i
think
if
the
res
left
the
court's
jurisdiction
before
the
court
decided
that
would
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction
to
control
the
disposition
of
the
res.
you
catch
me...
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
the
effect
of
a
mandate
is
when
we
run
into
it
in
our
work.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
generally
true,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
the
brig
ann,
the
rio
grande,
and
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
footnote
3
of
our
brief
are
all
strong
cases
for
the
proposition
that
in
an
in
rem
proceeding,
which
is
a
different
animal,
different
from
the
normal
in
personam
proceeding,
the
court's
jurisdiction,
the
court's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
that
was
what
was
at
issue
in
the
rio
grande
case.
the
court
recognized
an
exception,
we
view
it
as
a
rather
narrow
exception
where
the
res
is
improperly
or
fraudulently
removed
from
the
court's
control.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
was
unwilling
to
allow
an
unjustice
to
be,
an
injustice
to
be
done
in
that
case
so
it
was
willing
to
modify
the
rule
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
feel
that
there
was
no
injustice
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
i'd
like
to
address
that
point
at
some
length.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
because
we
feel
that
they
had
reasonable
steps
that
they
could
have
taken
to
preserve
the
court's
jurisdiction
on
appeal.
they
didn't
take
those
steps,
and
since
they
didn't
take
simple
steps
that
were
available
to
them
it
is
not
unjust
to
end
the
case
at
this
stage.
and
i
would
like
to
address
that
as
one
of
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
entered
an
order
requiring
the
marshall
to
dispose
of
the
res
in
accordance
with
law,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
government
did.
it
disposed
of
the
res
in
accordance
with
law
by
depositing
it
in
the
treasury.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
our
position
would
be
the
same
under
the
appropriations
clause.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
once
money
is
in
the
treasury,
even
if
it
gets
in
there
by
mistake--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that
would
be
dispositive
of
the
case
under
the
rio
grande,
this
old
decision
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
normal
rules
of
in
rem
jurisdiction
for
improper
removals,
but
that
can't
trump
the
appropriations
clause.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
our
position.
the
appropriations
clause
is
a
very
clear,
simple
constitutional
command.
there
must
be
an
appropriation.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again
we
don't
regard
it
as
a
big
hole
because
we
think
there
were
fairly
simple
steps
that
the
petitioner
could
have
taken
here
and
the
law
was
clear
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
they
didn't
take
those
steps
so
we
don't
feel
that
there
is
a
gap
that
needs
filling.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it
is
often
the
case,
justice
scalia,
in
the
case
involving
an
injunction,
for
example.
if
the
losing
party
fails
to
get
a
stay
of
the
judgment
a
final
judgment
can
be
executed
and
there
may
be
irreversible
consequences
of
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
it
is
possible--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--there
might
be
a
cause
of
action
against
a
government
official.
we
don't
think
there
would
be
any
action
against
the
united
states.
the
tucker
act
that
you
mentioned
in
the
claims
court,
this
court
has
said
there
has
to
be
a
substantive
right
to
recover
money
damages
against
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
true,
but
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on
the
basic
distinction
again
between
a
true
in
rem
proceeding,
which
this
is,
congress
has
said
it
is
a
true
in
rem
proceeding.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
i
don't.
i
think
the
appropriations
clause--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
as
a
practical
matter,
yes,
of
course.
if
this
court--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
you
may
not
want
to
put
it
in
terms
of
jurisdiction,
but
the
court
does
not
have
power
to
enter
an
order
requiring
a
payment
from
the
treasury
that
has
not
been
authorized
by
congress
in
an
appropriations
act.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
there
is
the
judgment
fund,
but
again
that
has
to,
as
the
court
said
in
opm
against
richmond,
there
has
to
be
a
statute
that
gives
you
a
substantive
right
to
damages
money
recovery
against
the
united
states.
but
again
let
me
make
the
basic
point,
it
is
a
fundamental
feature
of
a
true
in
rem
action
that
the
defendant
is
the
res.
that
has
been
established
since
before
the
time
of
the
constitution.
a
judgment,
an
in
rem
judgment
must
be
satisfied,
if
at
all,
out
of
the
res.
that's
why
once
the
res
has
left
the
court's
control
it
really
doesn't
do
to
say
well,
it
can
simply
enter
a
judgment,
you
can
get
it
from
some
place.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is
a
distinction,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
reason
for
it,
it's
a
long
established
historical
distinction.
the
reason
is
that
an
in
rem
judgment
has
to
be
satisfied
out
of
a
particular
piece
of
property.
an
in
personam
judgment
could
be
satisfied
out
of
any
property
or
person
located
anywhere.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
so
the
risk
of
having
an
unenforceable
judgment
is
much
higher.
i
mean,
the
classic
case
is
the
ship
that
sails,
the
court
releases--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it
is
true
that
the
government
has
taken
the
property
and
has
put
it
in
the
treasury,
but
it
is
no
longer
in
the
court's
control.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
think
the
amount
of
the
bond
should
have
been
sufficient
to
insure
that
the
government
was
compensated
for
the
costs
of
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
oh
yes,
certainly.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
i
haven't
solved
it.
that's
what
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
rule
62
provides
for.
the
amount
of
the
bond
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
that
is
the
requirement
of
the
rule.
the
amount
of
the
bond
could
be
greater.
we
would
think
in
some
cases,
probably
in
most
cases
the
court,
recognizing
that
the
government
held
the
property,
would
require
a
lesser
bond.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
remove
the
property.
the
purpose
of
the
bond
results
in
a
stay,
and
then
the
government
is
not
allowed
to
execute
the
judgment
and
the
property
stays
within
the
control
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
then
there
is
an
appropriations
clause
problem.
if
that
case
were
to
arise
the
attorney
general
would
exercise
his
discretion
to
return
the
property
to
the
claimant
or
return
it
to
the
control
of
the
court.
but
yes,
there
is
an
appropriations
clause
problem
and
it
arises
whether
or
not
the
money
gets
into
the
treasury
accidentally
or
improperly.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
under,
the
asset
forfeiture
fund
is
a
fund
in
the
treasury
and
congress
has
provided
that
money
may
be
paid
out
for
certain
purposes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
one
of
the
purposes
provided
by
congress
is
that
the
attorney
general
in
his
discretion
may
use
the
money
to
compromise
valid
liens
and
mortgages.
and
if
a
mistake
had
been
made
we
would
certainly
consider
correcting
it.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
no,
because
there
is
no
statute
that
authorizes
an
appropriation
for
that
purpose.
a
statute,
as
you
said
yourself
a
moment
ago,
a
statute
giving
the
attorney
general
discretion
to
do
something
is
not
the
same
as
an
appropriation
paying
judgments.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
it
is
not,
it
does
not
meet
the
requirement
of
the
appropriations
clause
because
it
does
not
clearly
provide
for
the
payment
of
a
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
because
congress
has
provided
that
this
is
a
fund
in
the
treasury
and
has
provided
that
payments
from
the
fund
have
to
be
made
pursuant
to
an
appropriation
by
congress.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
our
position
is
that
if
money
is
in
the
treasury
then
it
can
only
be
gotten
out
with
an
appropriation,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
money
can
be
paid
out
only
pursuant
to
an
appropriation,
that's
right,
even
in
an
extreme
case.
it's
a
clear
and
simple
constitutional
command.
let
me
back
up,
if
i
could,
and
take
just
a
minute
to
summarize
our
argument.
i
intended
to
do
this
at
the
beginning
and
i
think
i
can
give
our
entire
position
in
a
nutshell.
we
have
basically
just
four
points
that
we
think
establish
our
case.
first,
the
first
point
is
that
under
a
long
established
rule
applicable
to
true
in
rem
proceedings
the
court's
jurisdiction
depends
on
its
control
of
the
res.
an
in
rem
judgment
must
be
satisfied
if
at
all
from
the
res--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
admiralty
case,
but
the
shaw
case
is
an
in
rem
proceeding.
that
was
united
states
against
shaw,
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
309
u.s.
495.
that
was
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
there
the
united
states
was
the
plaintiff,
or
it
came
in
and
made
a
claim,
and
the
question
was
well,
did
it
therefore
submit
to
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
the
answer
was
no,
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--for
purposes
of
a
counter
claim.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
it
was
its
counter
claim
and
set
off,
but
again
in
order
to
get
money
out
of
the
treasury
or
to
get
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
there
would
have
to
be
a
right
of
action
in
personam.
then
we
move
out
of
the
specialized
world
of
the
in
rem
proceeding,
and
that's
really
a
different
claim.
a
claim
against
the
united
states
for
money
is
not
the
same
as
a
claim
for
the
return
of
this
property.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
do
not
have
a
case
that's
on
all
fours,
but
respectfully
i
think
the
brig
ann
and
the
rio
grande
are
quite
strong
support
for
us.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
can't
imagine
that
if
the
other
side
had
happened
to
get
control
of
the
ship
and
go
off
with
it
that
the
result
would
have
been
any
different.
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
that
case
was
that
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
statute.
the
bond,
appeal
bond
was
posted
in
that
case
and
the
court
made
a
great
deal
of
that
and
said
it
was
clearly
contrary
to
law
for
the
property
to
be
carried
off.
it
didn't
matter
which
party
carried
it
off
in
that
case.
so
our
first
point
again
is
that
an
in
rem
proceeding,
the
judgment
must
be
satisfied
out
of
the
res.
if
the
court
can't
control
the
res
it
cannot
enforce
a
judgment
in
rem.
our
second
point
is
that
the
united
states
did
not
consent
to
the
entry
of
a
judgment
in
personam
when
its
agents
filed
an
in
rem
forfeiture
proceeding.
congress
has
not
authorized
the
entry
of
a
judgment
in
personam
in
petitioner's
favor,
and
there
is
no
in
rem
exception
to
sovereign
immunity.
third,
petitioner's
appeal
is
barred
by
the
appropriations
clause.
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
res
have
been
deposited
in
the
treasury
and
congress
has
not
appropriated
funds
to
pay
a
judgment
for
petitioner.
and
finally,
there
is
nothing
unfair
or
unjust
about
requiring
petitioner
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
preserve
the
court's
jurisdiction
on
appeal.
appellants
are
often
required
to
take
such
steps.
losing
claimants
can
obtain
an
automatic
stay
by
posting
a
bond
which
protects
the
government
against
the
costs
of
an
appeal,
including
the
costs
of
storing
the
property,
and
if
a
losing
claimant
cannot
afford
to
post
a
bond
the
court
has
discretion
to
stay
the
judgment
without
requiring
a
bond.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
the
case
is
over.
we
think
it's
not,
there
has
been
a
final
judgment,
it
has
been
executed,
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
court
to
do.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
we
think
this
case
is
exactly
parallel.
in
munsingware
for
example,
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
the
court
refused
to
enter
a
munsingware
order
for
the
government
because
it
said
we
had
failed
to
take
simple
steps
we
could
have
taken
to
preserve
our
rights.
that's
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here
and
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--no.
the
case
is
simply
over.
there
has
been
a
final
judgment,
we
have
executed
it.
there
is
nothing
left
that
a
court
of
appeals
can
do.
but
the
original
judgment
is
not
moot.
and
of
course
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
question,
that's
properly
before
the
court.
petitioner
really
doesn't
contend
that
it
comes
within
a
recognized
exception
to
the
jurisdictional
rule,
but
instead
argues
that
this
court
should
basically
jettison
the
rule
that
in
rem
jurisdiction
requires
the
court
to
control
the
res.
we
urge
the
court
to
reject
that
suggestion,
which
is
a
radical
one.
the
rule
that
the
court
must
control
the
res
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
serves
the
important
purpose
of
preventing
federal
courts
from
issuing
unenforceable
judgments.
the
rule
is
regularly
applied
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
cases
cited
in
our
brief
including
the
cases
with
the,
circuits
with
the
greatest
familiarity
with
admiralty
such
as
the
fifth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
eleventh
circuit.
moreover,
and
this
is
a
central
point
of
our
position,
congress
has
legislated
in
this
area
on
the
assumption
that
the
traditional
rules
of
in
rem
jurisdiction
apply
in
this
area
unless
modified
by
statute.
congress
has
provided
in
28
usc
2461(b)
that
forfeiture
proceedings
shall
conform
as
near
as
may
be
to
in
rem
proceedings
in
admiralty
unless
otherwise
provided
by
act
of
congress.
thus
the
courts
are
not
at
liberty
to
develop
one
set
of
jurisdictional
rules
for
forfeiture
proceedings
and
a
different
set
of
rules
for
admiralty
cases.
and
in
addition
congress
clearly
understands
the
rules
of
in
rem
jurisdiction
and
has
shown
that
it
modifies
them
when
it
chooses
to
do
so.
for
example,
it
modified
the
traditional
rule
in
a
customs
statute,
19
usc
1605.
that's
discussed
in
our
brief.
the
purpose
of
that
modification
was
to
alter
the
traditional
rule
that
congress
understood
would
otherwise
apply,
that
the
res
must
remain
in
the
judicial
district
while
the
in
rem
procedure
was
pending.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
whether
it's
the
government
or
another
party,
if
there
is
a
final
order
that
allows
the
party
to
do
that,
allows
the
government
to
do
it
in
your
hypothetical,
any
final
judgment
can
be
executed.
and
once
the
ship
has
sailed
to
south
america
or
wherever
the
long
standing
rule
in
admiralty
cases
is
that
the
court
cannot
do
anything
because
it
can't
control
the
disposition
of
a
ship
in
south
america.
now
if
it
were
done
improperly
or
fraudulently
the
court
could
continue
to
exercise
jurisdiction
under
the
rio
grande
as
long
as
the,
because
the
appropriations
clause
problem
wouldn't
arise
in
that
case.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
the
court
made
an
exception
to
its
rule.
there
is
a
risk
of
unenforceable
judgments,
certainly.
the
court,
it
doesn't
discuss
this
in
the
rio
grande,
it's
an
old
decision,
but
the
court--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
under
the
rio
grande
the
court,
the
appeals
court
would
decide
the
appeal
and
would,
it
might
issue
a
judgment.
a
judgment
might
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it
could
be
against
the
ship
or
it
could
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
was
assuming
that
the
owner
of
the
ship
took
it
away.
yes,
it
could
be,
it
could
require
the
return--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
again
there's
a
question.
an
in
rem
judgment
would
have
to
be
a
judgment
against
the
ship.
the
court
might
also
enter,
i
suppose,
an
in
personam
judgment
against
the
plaintiff
on
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff,
now
not
the
government
so
not
subject
to
sovereign
immunity,
had
consented
to
the,
had
consented
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
the
united
states
is
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
but
again
the
united
states
is
subject
to
sovereign
immunity
and
can
only
be
sued--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
in
the
exact
hypothetical
you
give
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
issue
a
judgment
that
requires
payment
out
of
the
treasury
without
an
appropriation
by
congress.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
because
there
is
no
statute
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
if
it's
a
res
that's
not
in
the
treasury,
yes,
there
would
be
again
because
then
the
appropriations
clause
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
in
that
case
the
government
would
have
been
acting
illegally
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
as
we
read
the
appropriations
clause
there
is
no
exception
for
money
that
gets--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
again,
this
court
has
said
in
cases
such
as
opm
against
richmond
that
the
judgment
fund
is
not
an
all
purpose
fund
that
allows
a
court
to
enter
judgment
against
the
united
states.
there
has
to
be
another
statute
that
gives
a
substantive
right
to
recovery.
now,
if
there
was
something
illegal
or
fraudulent,
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here,
i
think
it's
quite
likely
there
would
be
some
sort
of
way
to
sue
an
official
of
the
government.
there
may
be
ways
that
that
could
be
done,
and
certainly
the
attorney
general
has
discretion
to
correct
an
error.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
and
let
me
close,
if
i
could,
by
emphasizing,
we
have
tried
to
convince
you
that
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
making
this
case
come
out
for
petitioner,
that
it
would
require
changing
subtle
principles
of
in
rem
jurisdiction--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--with
respect,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
i
admitted
that.
i
think
the
brig
ann
and
the
rio
grande--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
the
rio
grande
is
quite
similar.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
again,
i
think
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
the
other
party
had
taken
the
property
away.
but
there's
a
sovereign
immunity
problem,
there's
an
appropriations
clause
problem.
if
there
were
a
grave
injustice
in
this
case
perhaps
the
court
should
strain
to
change
the
rule,
but
congress
has
demonstrated
that
it
knows
about
these
rules
and
will
change
them
if
it
wants
to.
in
fact
congress
is
considering
legislation
right
now
that's
supported
by
the
administration
that
would
change
this
rule.
we
think
that
the
decision
should
be
left
to
congress.
this
is,
after
all,
a
rule
that
would
have
the
effect
of
expanding
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
and
finally,
what
happened
here
was
not
particularly
unfair
to
the
bank.
they
could
have
obtained
an
automatic
stay
by
posting
a
bond.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
have
not
offered
any
excuse
for
doing
that.
they
are
wrong
in
contending
that
the
bond
serves
no
purpose.
it
serves
to
compensate
the
government
for
the
costs
of
the
appeal
and
the
costs
of
maintaining
property.
a
lot
of
these
cases
involve
boats
and
airplanes.
the
costs
are
quite
significant.
and
it
also
deters
frivolous
appeals.
there
is
actually,
congress
expressly
requires
a
bond,
by
the
way,
when
an
administrative
forfeiture
proceeding
is
converted
into
a
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding.
so
congress
doesn't
think
that
a
bond
is
useless
when
the
government
has
the
property.
there
is
no
merit
to
petitioner's
contention
that
it
didn't
have
enough
time
to
decide
whether
to
appeal.
it
had
as
much
time
as
any
criminal
defendant
has,
and
in
injunction
cases
there
is
no
automatic
stay
at
all.
so
some
parties
are
in
a
worse
position
than
this
and
have
to
act
immediately
to
obtain
a
stay.
the
government
finds
itself
in
that
position
in
foia
cases,
for
example.
and
there
is
no
basis
for
the
speculation
that
there
will
be
an
avalanche
of
emergency
stay
applications
if
the
ordinary
established
rules
in
in
rem
proceedings
are
allowed
to
continue
in
effect.
these
are
the
rules
that
apply
in
the
fifth,
seventh,
ninth,
and
eleventh
circuits,
the
circuits
that
have
the
most
experience
with
admiralty
proceedings,
and
there
has
been
no
avalanche
of
emergency
stays
or
no
problem
with
courts
not
ruling
on
the
stays
in
a
timely
fashion.
as
this
court
said
in
halstrom
against
hillimuck
county,
the
equities
do
not
weigh
in
favor
of
petitioners
whose
procedural
default
is
caused
by
their
failure
to
take
the
minimal
steps
necessary
to
preserve
their
claims.
thank
you.
