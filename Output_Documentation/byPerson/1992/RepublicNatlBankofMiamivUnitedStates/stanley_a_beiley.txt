mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
federal
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
issue
is
can
the
united
states,
by
executing
on
a
favorable
currency
forfeiture
judgment,
divest
a
federal
appellate
court
of
appellate
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
merits
of
a
timely
filed
appeal.
the
eleventh
circuit
below
held
that
the
government
had
this
power,
which
holding
is
contrary
to
the
majority
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
which
have
addressed
this
very
issue.
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
the
government
can
bring
a
civil
forfeiture
lawsuit,
win
the
case
at
trial,
and
then
prevent
an
appellate
court
from
deciding
the
merits
of
that
appeal
by
transferring
the
funds
in
dispute
from
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
trial.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i
believe
that
would
follow
from
the
government's
position.
that's
certainly
not
the
position
that
we
advocate
before
this
court.
the
late
judge
vance
in
his
dissent
in
the
eleventh
circuit's
one
lear
jet
case,
which
dissent
is
now
the
basis
for
the
rule
in
the
majority
of
the
circuits,
referred
to
the
majority
opinion
which
adopted
the
government's
arguments
being
made
before
this
court
as
follows,
and
i
quote.
it
offends
fundamental
principles
of
fairness,
it
represents
a
departure
from
common
sense,
and
it
is
analytically
flawed.
we
believe
judge
vance's
comments
are
correct.
it
is
the
bank's
position
in
this
case
that
the
government
should
not
have
the
power
to
defeat
a
federal
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
by
its
unilateral
act
of
levying
on
a
forfeiture
judgment.
we
believe
that
when
the
government
or
any
party
brings
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court
that
party,
as
the
plaintiff,
submits
itself
to
the
court's
in
personam
jurisdiction
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
underlying
action.
the
bank
further
submits
that
the
nature
of
the
trial
court
proceeding,
whether
you
call
that
proceeding
in
rem,
quasi
in
rem,
or
in
personam,
should
have
no
bearing
on
the
issue
of
federal
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
it's
not
only
my
position,
your
honor,
but
it
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
several
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
a
pure
admiralty
case,
the
feckler
case,
the
british
transport
case,
and
several
prize
cases
where
the
government
has
intervened
in
admiralty
in
rem
cases
and
then
objected
to
cross
claims
being
filed
against
it.
and
this
court
had
held
that
when
the
united
states
intervenes
it
takes
the
position
of
a
private
suitor
for
all
purposes
for
which
justice
may
be
done.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
our
position
would
be
it
would
be
the
same,
your
honor,
that
the
government
by
initiating
an
action,
as
well
as
any
plaintiff
that
initiates
an
action,
submits
itself
to
the
court's
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
sovereign
immunity
we
believe
would
apply
to
suits
against
the
government,
not
to
suits
by
the
government.
in
your
hypothetical,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
about
the
government
initiating
a
lawsuit.
so
that
our
position
is--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--justice
o'connor,
first,
we
don't
believe
that
ancient
admiralty
cases
should
be
relevant
to
an
issue
of
federal
appellate
jurisdiction
in
a
currency
forfeiture
suit.
but
even
under
those
old
admiralty
cases,
our
reading
of
the
cases,
i
recognize
the
government
has
a
contrary
interpretation.
our
reading
of
the
traditional
old
admiralty
cases,
which
we
don't
believe
to
be
relevant,
is
that
jurisdiction
vests
upon
the
initial
seizure
and
that
the
continuous
seizure
or
the
continuous
court
control
of
the
res,
even
in
the
old
admiralty
cases,
is
only
required
in
two
circumstances,
none
of
which
apply
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
in
a
traditional
admiralty
case
if
the
only
way
that
the
court
can
fashion
meaningful
relief
to
the
litigants
is
to
have
custody
of
the
res
and
it's
essential
that
that
res
be
before
the
court
to
make
a
meaningful
award,
then
you
have
this
useless
judgment
exception,
as
we
referred
to
it
in
the
rules,
and
the
court
will
not
entertain
a
suit
where
it
can't
fashion
any
meaningful
relief.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
government
has
the
money.
the
government
has
had
possession
of
the
money
from
the
time
this
lawsuit
started.
so
we
don't
believe--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--our
position
would
be
if
the
absence
of
the
ship
in
the
ancient
admiralty
cases
would
make
any
judgment
rendered
by
the
appellate
court,
or
on
remand
the
trial
court,
meaningless,
then
the
court
under
concepts
of
mootness
or
case
in
controversy
could
decline
jurisdiction
and
dismiss
the
case.
but
again
that's
not
the
situation
in
this
case,
when
the
government
has
had
the
money
from
the
inception
of
the
suit,
and
even
under
their
position
has
the
money
today
in
the
treasury.
certainly
meaningful
relief
can
be
fashioned
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i'm
saying
the
old
admiralty
cases,
justice
scalia,
should
not
have
any
relevance
to
currency
cases.
to
the
extent
they
do
i
think
the
principles
are
the
same.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
congress
in
this
case
said
that
the
procedure
of
forfeiture
cases
shall
as
far
as
practicable
conform
to
admiralty.
we
interpret
that
as
a
position
that
procedurally
you
follow
admiralty
practice
in
forfeiture
cases,
but
we
do
not
read
that
as
a
declaration
by
congress
that
every
rule
of
substantive
law
that
has
ever
been
developed
in
admiralty
cases
ipso
facto
apply
in
forfeiture
cases.
nor
do
i
know
of
any
court
that
has
so
held.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
does
your
honor's
hypothetical
mean
stole
it
during
the
course
of
the
trial
court
proceeding
or
after
the
judgment?
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
your
honor,
that
again
gets
to
the
issue,
as
the
government
suggests,
about
the
necessity
for
posting
of
bond.
that
is
a
financial
risk
any
litigant
takes.
that
shouldn't
be
a
jurisdictional
issue.
for
example,
if
you
wish
to
preserve
the
res
put
a
bond
to
protect
and
insure
the
continuance
of
the
presence.
and
you
have
the
right
to
do
that
if
you
wish
to
put
up
a
bond.
our
point
though
that
that's
a
financial
risk.
it
shouldn't
be
converted
into
a
jurisdictional
risk
as
the
government
would
seek
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
case
held
that
initially,
that
initial
seizure
vested
jurisdiction,
and
that
certainly
an
accidental
or
an
improper
removal
of
the
res
would
not
divest
jurisdiction.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
your
honor,
if
the
res
were
an
immutable
rule
of
jurisdiction,
if
a
court
lacked
power
to
proceed
to
adjudicate
a
case
without
that
res
before
it,
then
i
would
submit
that
any
removal
of
the
res
for
any
reason,
accidental,
improper,
act
of
god,
or
otherwise,
should
divest
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
exception
in
essence
highlights
the
original
rule
as
we
interpret
the
admiralty
cases,
which
is
that
jurisdiction
is
complete
upon
initial
seizure
unless
the
removal
would
make
the
court's
judgment
meaningless
and
worthless
because
there's
no
basis
to
afford
the
parties
relief.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
with
the
two
exceptions
that
i
read
out
of
the
admiralty
cases,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--the
useless
judgment
and
the
voluntary
abandonment
situation
which
came
up
in
one
of
the
other
old
admiralty
cases.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
yes,
justice
white,
they
did.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
justice
white,
the
agreement
was
that,
the
case
started
out
as
a
forfeiture
against
a
luxury
home.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
the
government
got
a
sales
offer
and,
on
joint
motion
with
my
clients
consent,
asked
the
trial
court
to
sell
the
property
and
take
the
proceeds
from
the
property
and
put
those
proceeds
in
the
court
registry
as
a
substitute
for
the
realty.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
after
the
judgment
became
final
they
asked
the
marshall
to
wire
transfer
the
funds
by
bookkeeping
entries
to
the
treasury.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
well,
we
think
the
eleventh
circuit
misinterpreted
the
stipulation.
that
is
not
a
focal
point
of
our
argument
here
because
we--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
don't
think
this
court
took
jurisdiction,
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
interpret
a
stipulation.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
the
stipulation
indicated
that
our
rights
would
be
without
prejudice.
by
wire
transferring
the
funds
we
think
we
have
been
prejudiced
but
we
are
not
relying
on
that
as
the
basis
for
the
relief
that
we
seek
before
this
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact
i
will
address
that
now.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
now
the
funds
somehow
are
in
the
treasury,
and
that
being
in
the
treasury
the
appropriations
clause
precludes
the
relief
that
we
seek.
i
think
their
argument
fails
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one,
the
issue
of
whether
these
funds
are
government
funds,
it's
my
position,
is
only
when
this
case
is
over,
when
the
appeal
is
over.
we
say
it's
our
funds.
the
government
says
it's
their
funds.
that's
the
issue
for
a
court
on
the
merits
to
decide.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
well,
we
don't
concede
that,
your
honor.
money
we
believe
to
be
a
fungible
asset.
we
believe
that
all
that
happens
when
money
moves
from
one
account
to
the
other
are
bookkeeping
entries.
i
think
either
the
first
or
the
third
circuit
or
perhaps
both
expressed
it
best
when
they
said
to
predicate
jurisdiction
on
what
government
pocket
holds
the
money
is
seemingly
an
artful
way
to
determine
federal
or
public
jurisdiction.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
government's
position
on
that
point
is
correct,
the
government
in
the
classic
in
personam
case,
take
a
case,
a
student
loan
hypothetical
where
the
government
sues,
collects.
the
defendant
chooses
not
to
supercede
and
the
government
collects
money
from
the
defendant
while
the
appeal
is
pending
and
sends
the
money
to
the
treasury,
which
they
would
have
a
right
to
do
where
you
have
an
unsuperseded
judgment.
is
the
government
going
to
take
the
position
in
that
case
that
the
appropriations
clause
bars
relief
because
in
an
in
personam
case
the
loser
of
a
student
loan
claim
did
not
supercede?
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
what
happens
when
money
is
in
a
bank
account,
you
have
a
debtor-creditor
relationship,
the
bank
and
the
depositor.
you
have
a
situation
here
where
the
treasury
owes
money
to
the
government
which
has
not
yet
been
resolved
until
this
appeal
is
resolved
on
the
merits.
as
the
first
or
the
third
circuit
or
perhaps
both
have
said,
the
government
is
everywhere
so
the
obligation
is
owed
everywhere.
but
more
importantly,
and
i
didn't
quite
finish
my
answer
to
the
appropriations
clause
question
posed
by
the
chief
justice,
to
the
extent
we
need
statutory
authority
to
get
these
funds
we
have
two
sets
of
statutes.
we
have
28
u.s.
code
2465
which
says
quite
plainly
that
forfeited
property
shall
be
returned
to
a
successful
claimant,
and
we
have
28
u.s.
code
524
(c)(1)(d)
which
is
the
department
of
justice
asset
forfeiture
funds
which
says
one
purpose
for
which
forfeited
funds
should
be
used
is
to
be
paid
to
claimants.
so
to
the
extent--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--your
honor,
we
think
both
of
those
statutes
set
forth
appropriations
out
of
forfeited
funds
to
be
paid
to
claimants
to
those
funds,
such
as
the
bank
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
those
statutes
that
say
that
the
statutes
don't
apply
if
the
money
is
in
the
treasury.
it
says
that
forfeited
funds
shall
be
returned
to
the
successful
claimant.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
specific
appropriation
for
use
of
forfeited
funds.
if
forfeited,
if
congress
says
forfeited
funds
shall
be
paid
to
a
successful
claimant
the
fact
that
the
government
has
levied
and
put
the
funds
in
the
treasury
doesn't
change
that
those
funds
can
serve
that
purpose.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that's
certainly
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that
is
our
position.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
they,
in
their
brief
they
take
the
position
that
there
are
mootness
concerns.
they
don't
quite
come
out
and
say
that
the
case
is
moot
but
they
suggest
mootness
concerns.
we
don't
think
the
case
is
moot.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i'm
not
particularly
certain
as
to
what
the
government
means
why
the
case
is
moot.
if
their
position
is
that
the
appropriations
clause
makes
it
moot,
i
believe
i
answered
that
contention
a
moment
ago.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
the
government's
suggestion
in
this
case
that
the
solution
to
this
jurisdictional
problem
is
the
posting
of
a
bond
or
the
attention
of
a
stay,
and
with
all
respect
to
the
government,
we
believe
simply
makes
no
sense.
the
sole
purpose
of
a
supersedeas
bond
historically
and
otherwise
is
to
assure
a
successful
trial
litigant
that
its
judgment
will
be
paid
if
the
execution
on
that
judgment
is
delayed
while
an
appeal
goes
forward.
there's
never
any
risk
of
non
payment
to
the
government
in
a
civil
forfeiture
case
because
the
government
has
possession
of
the
property.
they
had
it
at
the
inception
of
the
suit
and
they
had
it
after
the
suit
was
over.
a
bond
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
whatsoever.
nor
is
a
stay,
which
is
a
discretionary
ruling
by
a
trial
court,
a
very
sensible
prerequisite
to
federal
appellate
jurisdiction
because
federal
appellate
jurisdiction
should
not
depend
upon
trial
courts
discretionary
rulings.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
traditionally
the
amount
of
a
supersedeas
bond
would
cover
future
interest
on
the
principal
sum
of
money
and
perhaps
appellate
costs.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
there's
nothing
that
prohibited
the
government
from
putting
those
funds
in
an
interest
bearing
account.
we
would
have
no
objection
to
the
government
levying
on
those
funds
and
investing
it
in
anyway
they
saw
fit.
our
position
is
that
that
shouldn't
preclude
us
from
taking
an
appeal
to
a
federal
appellate
court.
if
the
government
wished
to
invest
those
funds
and
earn
interest
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do
so.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
would
think
so.
[laughter]
the
position
that
we
assert,
that
the
plaintiff,
any
plaintiff,
when
it
brings
a
case
in
court
submits
itself
to
the
in
personam
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
we
believe
applies
here.
very
early
on
this
court
in
two
old
cases,
adam
v.
saenger
and
nations
v.
johnson,
held,
and
i
don't
think
i
can
state
it
any
better,
that
no
rule
can
be
a
sound
one
which
will
deprive
a
party
of
his
right
to
have
his
case
submitted
to
an
appellate
court.
no
rule.
adam/saenger,
nations/johnson,
hold
that
when
the
plaintiff
seeks
relief
that
that
party
is
subject
to
the
court's
jurisdiction
for
all
purposes
for
which
justice
is
required.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
no,
justice
white.
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
constitutional
right,
but
i
certainly
believe
it
to
be
a
very
fundamental
right
of
a
federal
litigant.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that
is
correct.
congress,
in
prescribing
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts,
in
28
u.s.
code
1291
states
that
federal
courts
of
appeal
have
appellate
jurisdiction
over
trial
court
final
judgments.
what
we
believe
the
government
is
doing
here
is
attempting
by
its
unilateral
act
of
levying
on
a
judgment
to
interfere
with
that
congressional
appellate
jurisdiction
mandate,
which
we
believe
to
be
improper.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
lower
court
can
indeed,
if
this
case
were
decided
on
the
merits
in
favor
of
my
bank,
decide
this
case
on
the
merits
and
enter--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--yeah.
direct
the
government
under
restitution
principles
in
the
two
statutes
cited
before
to
give
us
those
forfeited,
those
portions
of
the
forfeited
funds
to
which
my
bank
is--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--i'm
relying
on
28
u.s.
code
2465
which
holds
that
upon
a
successful
judgment
in
favor
of
a
claimant
forfeited
funds
shall
be
returned
to
the
claimant,
and
28
u.s.
code
524(c)(1)(d).
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
believe
it
is
an
appropriation
with
respect
to
forfeited
funds.
it
directs
the
allocation
of
forfeited
funds
to
a
successful
claimant.
what
the
government
has
possession
of
in
this
case
is
forfeited
funds.
we
are
seeking
to
get
the
portion
back
that
we
claim
we're
entitled
to.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
under
civil
forfeiture
law,
justice
white,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
a
claimant
to
property,
such
as
a
mortgagee,
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
that
party
had
no
actual
knowledge
of
the
underlying
transactions.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
that's
correct.
we
were
claiming
innocent
ownership,
and
that
was
the
dispute
of
the
government.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
the
district
court
found
against
us.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
took
that
issue
up.
we
felt
there
were
clearly
erroneous
factual
findings
of
the
trial
court
and
that
the
trial
court
applied
the
wrong
legal
standard.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
those
statutes
direct
how
forfeited
funds
shall
be
paid.
i
don't
think
the
government
can
avoid
the
impact
of
that
case
by
bringing
a
suit
to
acquire
forfeited
funds
and
put
it
into
the
treasury.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i
believe
those
statutes
would
apply
whether
the
funds
remained
in
district
court
in
the
marshall's
account
or
were
levied
upon
as
they
were
done
in
this
case
and
wire
transferred
or
by
bookkeeping
entries
put
into
the
treasury
account.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
because
congress--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--we
believe
them
to
be,
the
statutes
to
be
an
appropriation
as
to
what
use
can
be
made
of
forfeited--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--justice
souter,
if
the
import
of
your
honor's
question
is
if
these
two
statutes
were
unconstitutional
would
i
be
making
a
different
argument,
we
would
not
be
making,
we
would
be
making
an
argument
that
would
lead
to
the
same
result,
and
the
argument
we
would
be
urging,
in
addition
to
the
one
we
urge
with
the
statutes,
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
subject
to
the
court's
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i
don't
believe
so.
the
very
rulings
or
interpretations
of
that
statute,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
by
the
government
show
that
one
of
those
purposes
is
to
pay
valid
mortgages
against
the
property.
24--
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
--we
want
our
mortgage
on
property
recognized,
and
the
fact
that
that
money
has
been
turned
over
to
the
treasury
we
don't
think
in
anyway
changes
the
result.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
a
very
brief
statement.
we
believe
that
appellate
review,
though
not
a
constitutional
right,
is
certainly
a
very
basic,
fundamental,
and
important
right
to
federal
litigants.
we
believe
it
is
a
right
that
is
worth
preserving.
we
respectfully
ask
this
honorable
court
to
preserve
it
here.
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
sent
back
to
the
eleventh
circuit
to
reinstate
the
appeal
and
decide
my
client's
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
would
ask
the
eleventh
circuit
to
order
the
government
out
of
the
forfeited
funds
to
pay
us
those
funds
to
which
we
are
entitled
on
our
mortgage,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
any
government
money
is
fine
with
us.
[laughter]
mr.
stanley
a.
beiley
we
do
not,
justice
white.
i
thank
the
court
very
much
for
its
consideration.
