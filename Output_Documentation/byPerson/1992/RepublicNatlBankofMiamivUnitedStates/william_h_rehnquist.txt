argument
next
in

91-767,
republic
national
bank-of
miami
v.
united
states.
mr.
beiley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
would
be
your
view
even
in
a
classical
admiralty
action,
mr.
beiley,
where
everybody
agrees
it
is
a
prototypical
in
rem
action,
nonetheless
the
government
there
would
submit
itself
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
the
same
thing
though
as
an
admiralty
action
say
initiated
by
the
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beiley.
the
case
is
submitted.
