we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-486,
united
states
and
federal
communications
commission
v.
the
edge
broadcasting
company.
spectators
are
reminded
not
to
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
licensee,
is
the
license
conditioned
on
obeying
governing
federal
statutes
relating
to,
such
as
the
one
we've
got
before
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
station
clearly
is
not
authorized
to
broadcast
gambling
information
to,
from
where
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
statutes
are
presumed
to
be
constitutional.
the
person
challenging
them
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
they're
not.
is
that
true
when
the
only
basis
for
regulation
is
the
content
of
the
speech
that's
being
prohibited?
is
that
true
the
burden
is...
how
does
the
burden
rest
in
that
kind
of
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
shumadine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
by
hypothesis,
mr.
shumadine,
if
lotteries
are
willing
to
advertise
on
the
edge
station
they
must
think
they're
going
to
get
some
added
patronage
from
so
advertising.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
they
want
to
advertise
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
almost
by
fourth
grade
addition,
i
would
think,
you
could
prove
there
would
be
a
greater
quantity
of
advertisements
if
one
additional
station
is
now
permitted
to
carry
advertisements
that
wasn't
before.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
they,
if
they
decide
to
advertise
on
the
edge
broadcast
because
of
effectiveness,
obviously
they
are
reaching
some
people
that
they
wouldn't
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that's
what
they
set
out
to
do.
the
budget
is
based
on--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wait
a
minute.
please
don't
interrupt
me
while
i'm
asking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
advertisers
budget
on
the
basis
of
effectiveness.
and
what
i
put
to
you
is
if
they
do
that,
as
you
say
they
do,
surely
they
must
think
they're
getting
something
for
their
money
if
they
were
to
advertise
on
the
edge
station.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
shumadine,
in
suny
wasn't
that
a
dormitory
regulation?
so
we're
not
talking
about
any
world
scope
of
it.
we're
talking
just
about
factual
findings
that
would
look
into
the
effect
of
the
regulation
throughout
its
scope,
because
it
just
wasn't
a
broad
thing.
i
don't
see
that
as
authority
for
the
proposition
when
you're
talking
about
an
act
of
congress
you
focus
just
on
one
particular
incidence
rather
than
the
nationwide
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
scheme
is
effective?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you're
saying
that
the
government
in
every
case
where
something
is
challenged
on
a
first
amendment
basis
must
offer
empirical
evidence
that
the
statute
is
effective
for
its
purpose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
do
you
think
supports
the
proposition
that
the
government
must
offer
empirical
evidence
so
that
you
have
an
actual
factual
determination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
say
suny
then
supports
the
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
mr.
shumadine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shumadine,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
haven't
we
said,
mr.
shumadine,
that
when
we're
talking
about
commercial
speech
the
legislature
can
enact
a
prophylactic
rule
which
it
couldn't
in
connection
with
straight
first
amendment
speech
that
may
reach
out
a
little
more
broadly
than
you
could
in
first
amendment
orthodox?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
in
a
commercial
speech
case
that
if
a
plaintiff
can
show
that
there
is
one
in
his
particular
example,
the
thing
does
not
satisfy
the
four
prongs,
even
though
it
does
in
99
percent
of
the
other
cases,
that
litigant
can
have
that
statute
struck
down
as
to
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question,
mr.
shumadine.
thank
you.
mr.
larkin,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
