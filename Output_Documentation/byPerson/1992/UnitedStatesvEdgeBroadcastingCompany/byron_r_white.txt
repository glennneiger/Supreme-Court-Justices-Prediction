justice

you
don't
even
need
to
reach
central
hudson?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
even
if
we
didn't
disagree
with
you
on
that,
even
if
we
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that
you
would
say
central
hudson
is
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way,
north
carolina
doesn't
purport
to
forbid
its
citizens
from
listening
to
lottery
ads
from
virginia
stations.
they
don't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--no,
they
couldn't.
and
so
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--its
citizens
can
listen
to
lottery
ads
from
virginia
stations
all
they
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
north
carolina
doesn't
purport
to
keep
its
citizens
from--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
as
applied
to
some
other
stations
in
north
carolina
you
wouldn't
have
any
objection?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
there
are
probably
people
who
listen
most
of
the
time
to
the
edge
station.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
in
business
if
it
didn't
have
an
audience,
and
if
that,
if
the
audience
that
listens
to
edge
stations,
the
station,
can't
hear
lottery
ads
on
that
station,
why
it
certainly
to
that
extent
serves
the
interest
that
the
statute
has
in
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
as
long
as
somebody
is
listening
to
edge,
and
if
edge
is
forbidden
from
carrying
lottery
ads,
as
long
as
somebody
is
listening
to
edge
station
it
is
not
going
to
hear
lottery
ads,
and
that
would
go
for
all
stations
in
north
carolina.
if
the
people
who
listen
to
north
carolina
stations
can't
hear
lottery
ads
on
those
stations
it
certainly
serves
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
they
don't
listen
to
the
virginia
stations,
they
won't
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
as
long
as
they're
listening
to
north
carolina
stations
they're
not
going
to
be
listening
to
ads.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
while
they're
listening
to
those
stations
they
are
not
listening
to
ads.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
would
they
pay
for
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
also
not
hard
to
imagine
that
there
are
a
lot
of
law
abiding
citizens
in
north
carolina
who
don't
believe
in
gambling.
and
i
don't
know
why
edge
should
have
the
right
to
carry
lottery
ads
advertising
something
that's
against
the
law
in
north
carolina.
i've
been
a
big
fan
of
the
edge
station,
but
now
i
can't
listen
anymore,
they're
bombarding
me
with
lottery
ads.
i
don't
believe
in
lotteries.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
only
marginal
because
you're
just
talking
about
edge,
and
if
you
talk
about
all
the
stations
in
north
carolina
that
are
not
permitted
to
carry
these
ads,
why
surely
there's
quite
a
direct
service
to
the
government
interest
in
protecting
the
interests
of
north
carolina.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
gets
you
back
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question.
is
that
the
way
you
approach
commercial
speech
cases?
