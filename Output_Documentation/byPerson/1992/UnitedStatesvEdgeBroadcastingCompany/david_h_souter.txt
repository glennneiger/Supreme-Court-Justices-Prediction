justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shumadine,
let
me
go
back
to
central
hudson
if
i
may
and
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
at
one
point
earlier
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
there
was
an
effectiveness
component
under
the
fourth
central
hudson
prong.
i
take
it
that
is
not
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
think
i
understand
you.
what
is
your
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
fourth
prong
is
not
satisfied,
the
fourth
prong
being
that
the
regulation
must
not
be
more
extensive
than
necessary
to
serve
the
substantial
purpose?
why
isn't
that
satisfied
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true,
but
the
fourth
prong
simply
requires
that
the
regulation
not
be
more
extensive.
this
isn't
more
extensive,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
this
gets
back
to
justice
white's
colloquy.
whether
there
might
be
ways
in
which
the
government
could
accomplish
that
purpose
more
effectively
is
a
different
question.
it
accomplishes
something.
assuming
that
there
are
people
listening
to
the
station
at
all,
those
people
are
not
going
to
be
listening
to
advertising
about
the
lottery.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
given
the
fact
that
there
will
be
some
effect
it's
difficult
to
argue
under
the
fourth
prong
that
the
regulation
in
the
central
hudson
words
is
more
extensive
than
is
necessary.
it
may
not
pick
up
much,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
more
extensive
than
is
necessary.
it
just
is,
it
is
not...
your
argument
is
that
it's
ineffective,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
a
different
concept.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shumadine,
it
seems
to
me
although
you
emphasize
in
answering
justice
kennedy's
question
the
particularity
of
the
exception
that
you're
arguing
for,
at
least
in
the
context
of
fcc
licensing
if
we
accepted
your
argument
it
would
be
a
very
broad
exception
because
you
in
effect
would
be
saying
that
only,
that
this
particular
regulation
would
be
enforceable
only
with
respect
to
broadcasters
over
a
geographical
area
which
do
not
receive,
as
it
were,
the
forbidden
broadcasts
from
outside
and
which
do
not
in
turn
broadcast
to
a
substantial
audience
outside
the
area
in
which
the
activity
is
forbidden.
so
that
i
suppose
on
your
theory
there
might
be
some
kind
of
enclave
in
the
center
of
large
states
in
which
the
regulation
would
be
enforceable,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
enforceable
anywhere
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
you've
got
92
percent
effectiveness.
that's
as
far
as
you've
gotten,
haven't
you?
you
concede
8
percent,
don't
you?
