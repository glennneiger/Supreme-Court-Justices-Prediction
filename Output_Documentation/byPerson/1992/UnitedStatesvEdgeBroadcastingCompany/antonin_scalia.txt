mr.
larkin,
i
didn't,
i
guess
i
knew
but
i
had
forgotten
that
you
didn't
have
to
have
your
transmitter
located
within
the
community
that
you're
licensed
to
serve.
i
suppose...
and
i
had
thought
that
one
of
the
things
that
supported
your
position
or
the
government's
position
is
that
it,
the
government
certainly
might
think
it
unreasonable
to
permit
the
state
law
to
be
violated
on
the
very
ground
of
the
state
by
transmitting
from
its
own
soil
advertisements
that
are
against
its
public
policy.
but
as
i
understand
the
way
things
can
work,
if
you
had
a
transmitter,
if
you
had
a
station
licensed
to
a
community
which
permitted
gambling
you
could
have
your
transmitter
located
across
the
border
in
a
state
that
bans
gambling
and
you
could
broadcast
from
that
state
gambling
announcements
which
would
go
to
the
community
to
which
you're
licensed
since
that
community
permits
it,
and
would
also
go
to
the
people
within
that
state
that
you're
broadcasting
from,
which
is
not
the
community
you
are
licensed
to
serve.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
vice
versa.
i
expect
it
happens
all
the
time,
mr.
larkin,
that
in
fact
whoever
got
the
license
expected
to
make
more
money
in
the
norfolk
area
than
in
elizabeth
city.
have
you
ever
been
to
elizabeth
city?
it's
very
nice.
it's
on
the
way
to
the
outer
banks,
but
there
ain't
much
there.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
sure
whether
a
state
that
prohibits
prostitution,
for
example,
can
ban
advertising
of
houses
of
prostitution
across
the
border
in
another
state?
or
a
state
that
bans
cocaine
use
can
ban
advertising
of
cocaine
use
available
across
the
border?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
you're
concerned
about
just
commerce
clause
objections,
not
first
amendment
objections.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
not
licensed
to
that
community.
your
station
comes
into
the
fcc
and
says
we
want
to
be
licensed
to
this
elizabeth
city
community
in
north
carolina.
we
want
to
meet
their
local
community
needs,
one
of
which
is
that
they
say
we
don't
want
gambling.
we
think
gambling
is
bad
for
our
society.
and
you
want
to
meet
their
needs
by
advertising
into
that
community
against
the
law.
why
is
it
unreasonable
to
say
that's
not
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
meets
the
interest
of
making
a
licensee
who
is
licensed
to
serve
the
particular
needs
of
that
community,
as
others
are
not,
serve
those
needs.
you
stand
in
a
different
position
from
these
other
advertisers
because
you
have
been
licensed
to
that
community,
to
serve
the
particular
needs
of
that
community.
doesn't
that
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shumadine,
empiricism
meaning
if
i'm
doing
no
more
harm
than
other
people
are
doing
you
can't
really
discern
my
contribution
to
the
harm
being
done,
therefore
you
can't
stop
me?
suppose
elizabeth
city
has
a
law
against
prostitution
and
it
could
be
shown
that
in
fact
it's
easy
to
obtain
prostitutes
in
elizabeth
city
if
you're
of
a
mind
to,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
avenues
for
advertising
the
availability
of
houses
of
prostitution
in
elizabeth
city.
would
you
then
come
up
here
and
argue
well,
therefore
you
cannot
stop
my
station
from
advertising
of
prostitution
because
it
would
have
no
significant
effect?
you
wouldn't
be
making
that
argument,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
say
the
same
thing
if
this
case
involved
prostitution
or
drug
use
or
anything
else,
so
long
as
there
were
stations
outside
of
north
carolina
that
can
get
that
same
message
to
the
individuals?
your
station
is
entitled
to
do
that
even
though
you're
licensed
to
the
community?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
everybody
else
except
one?
aren't
there,
are
there
not
other
north
carolina
stations
that
reach
elizabeth
city?
is
yours
the
only
station
licensed
to
north
carolina
that
reaches
elizabeth
city?
justice
antonin
scalia
elizabeth
city
gets
no
other
north
carolina
station?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
i'm
saying
don't
you
think
that
there
are
likely
a
number
of
other
north
carolina
stations
that
come
into
elizabeth
city,
that
can
be
received
in
elizabeth
city?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
really
saying
that
you
are
the
only,
the
only
broadcast
station
that
is
in
operation
reaching
elizabeth
city
that
cannot
advertise
lotteries?
