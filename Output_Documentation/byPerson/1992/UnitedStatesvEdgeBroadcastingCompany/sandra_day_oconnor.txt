mr.
larkin,
under
a
first
amendment
analysis
in
commercial
speech
cases
when
we
apply
central
hudson
do
we
look
case-by-case
at
an
as-applied
challenge
or
do
we
simply
look
to
whether
the
central
hudson
test
is
met
and
it's
a
reasonable
response
to
the
overall
problem?
is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
as-applied
case-by-case
look
in
the
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
applied
here
insofar
as
it
addresses
the
problem
of
a
commercial
advertisement,
do
we
look
at
some
case-by-case
approach
and
say
well,
look,
in
this
case
it's
so
close
to
the
border
it's
ridiculous
as
applied
to
edge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
sure
the
precedent
is
all
that
clear,
so
i'm
interested
to
hear
your
response.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
just
apply
central
hudson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
have
to
ask
for
instance
whether
there
is
a
substantial
government
interest
in,
in
what?
in
protecting
north
carolina
citizens
from
knowing
about
what
goes
on
in
virginia?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
north
carolina's
goal
insofar
as
it
deals
with
commercial
speech
about
something
going
on
lawfully
in
virginia?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
in
another
state
where
it's
lawful?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
certainly
the
people
in
north
carolina
can
hear
ads
in
a
virginia
licensed
station,
can't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
how
far
these
licenses
typically
allow,
i
mean
how
large
a
geographic
area
the
broadcast
reaches
typically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
shumadine--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
test
do
we
apply
here?
central
hudson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
apply
central
hudson
why
do
we
care
whether
this
particular
community
may
broadcast
to
a
lot
of
folks
in
virginia?
why
do
we
care?
don't
we
look
at
the
overall
effect
of
the
statute
on
the
nation
as
a
whole?
do
we
really
get
into
a
case-by-case,
as-applied
look,
or
do
we
just
apply
central
hudson
and
look
at
it
overall?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
maybe
it
is.
i
mean,
what
case
of
ours
do
you
rely
on
in
the
commercial
speech
context
to
give
it
the
kind
of
individual
focus
that
you
say
is
appropriate
here?
