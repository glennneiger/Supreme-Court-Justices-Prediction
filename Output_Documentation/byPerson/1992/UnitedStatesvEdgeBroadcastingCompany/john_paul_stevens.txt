justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
that,
mr.
larkin.
they
are
licensed
to
serve
elizabeth
city,
north
carolina,
but
isn't
it
something
like
90
percent
of
their
listening
audience
is
outside
of
elizabeth
city?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that...
how
much
magic
is
there
in
the
words
licensed
to
elizabeth
city
when,
as
i
understand
it,
elizabeth
city
represents
only
4
or
5
percent
of
their
total
audience,
of
the
total
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
8
percent,
whatever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
unlicensed
to
serve
the
92
other
percent
of
their
audience?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
they
are
mandated
to
serve
that
elizabeth
city.
they
have
a
duty,
i
guess,
to
serve
that
community.
but
they
also
are
permitted
under
their
license,
are
they
not,
to
broadcast
to
a
much
larger
audience?
and
is
this
larger
audience
totally
irrelevant
to
the
problem
that
we
have
to
confront?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
totally
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they
have,
i
guess
they
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
transmit
it
as
long
as
there's
no
statutory
objection
to
an
audience
that,
you
could
pose
to
a
lot
of
people
who
want
to
buy
lottery
tickets
in
virginia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not
an
unavoidable...
i
suppose
the
license
restriction
could
say
your
signal
shall
be
no
stronger
than
is
necessary
to
serve
the
area
for
which
you're
specifically
licensed.
i
guess
they
could
limit
them
to
the
north
carolina
area,
and
then
this
thing
might
make
some
sense.
but
as
i
understand
it
they're
authorized
to
broadcast,
and
if
they
conflicted
with
other
stations
there
would
be
a
problem,
i
gather,
when
you
have
scarce
frequencies.
but
they
are
authorized,
as
i
understand
it,
not
merely
to
license,
to
broadcast
to
the
small
community
but
to
a
larger
audience
that
mostly
includes
virginia
residents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
their
broadcasting
into
virginia
interfered
with
the
signals
of
other,
of
virginia
stations
in
virginia
they
would
then
be
subject
to
some
kind
of
restriction
from
the
fcc?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
are,
they
are
authorized
in
the
sense
that
the
license
allows
them
to
do
that
without
any
federal
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
this
lesser
includes
the,
or
greater
includes
the
lesser?
can
north
carolina
prohibit
its
citizens
from
going
over
to
virginia
and
buying
lottery
tickets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
can
they
prohibit
them
from
buying
lottery
tickets?
they
are
their
own
citizens,
they
have
rights
to
tell
them
what
they
can
do.
you
don't
think
they
could
prohibit
them
from
buying
lottery
tickets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
by
its
own
citizens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
how
does
it
get
the
authority
to
prevent
its
own
citizens
to
hear
about
the
lottery
that's
available
in
virginia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just...
let's
talk
about
lotteries
only.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what,
how
can
north
carolina
prevent
its
citizens
from
buying
lottery
tickets
in
virginia?
maybe
they
cash
them
in
down
there
too.
and
if
it...
first
question
is
can
they
prevent
their
own
citizens
from
buying
lottery
tickets
in
virginia?
if
the
answer
is
no,
how
then
do
you
justify
a
restriction
on
advertising
directed
at
north
carolina
citizens
who
might
want
to
buy
the
virginia
lottery
tickets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
how
can
they
prohibit
advertising
designed
to
encourage
them
to
travel
to
virginia
and
buy
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i'm
not...
my
example
doesn't
involve
any
interstate
transportation
of
lottery
tickets.
it
only
involves
interstate
transportation
of
north
carolina
citizens
who
want
to
buy
the
lottery
tickets
in
virginia,
and
therefore
would
like
to
know
about
the
lottery
through
the
channels
of
communication
that
the
first
amendment
sometimes
protects?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
hasn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
congress
prohibit
north
carolina
citizens
from
patronizing
the
virginia
lottery
or
say
only
virginia
citizens
may
patronize
the
virginia
lottery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
may
i
just
pursue
justice
kennedy's
point
one
step
further
to
get
it
sharp?
it
seems
to
me
the
question
should
be
whether
the
state
of
north
carolina,
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
notion,
could
prohibit
gambling
advertising
of
the
lotteries
in
virginia
in
its
own
newspapers
in
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
illegal
in
north
carolina,
but
it's
not
illegal
for
the
citizens,
as
i
understand
you,
to
go
across
the
border
and
buy
the
tickets.
but
can
therefore
the
virginia
lottery
people
run
ads,
do
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
advertise
their
lotteries
in
north
carolina
newspapers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
advertising
activity
that's
legal
where
it's
performed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
they
can--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
larkin,
how
do
we
know
it's
reasonable
as
a
general
matter?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
that
this
is
not
a
typical
station?
i
mean,
i
know
of
a
lot
of
stations
that
broadcast
across
state
lines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
may
assume
that
this
is
a
typical
station,
and
you
would
still
defend
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
characteristic
of
the
program,
and
we
can
justify--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why,
how...
you
have
not
proved
that
it's
not
characteristic
of
a
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who...
then
the
question
comes
who
has
the
burden
of
showing
this
is
or
is
not
typical?
