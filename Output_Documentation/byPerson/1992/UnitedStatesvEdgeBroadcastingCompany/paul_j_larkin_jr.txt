mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
first
amendment
challenge
by
a
radio
station
to
congress'
regulatory
program
for
broadcast
lottery
advertising.
sections
1304
and
1307
of
title
18
create
a
simple
bright
line
geographically
based
rule
under
which
a
station's
right
to
broadcast
lottery
advertising
hinges
on
the
state
to
which
that
radio
station
is
licensed.
a
radio
station
licensed
to
a
state
like
virginia
that
runs
a
state
lottery
can
broadcast
lottery
advertising
about
that
state's
lottery
or
any
other
state
lottery.
by
contrast,
a
radio
station
licensed
to
a
state
like
north
carolina
without
a
state
lottery
cannot
broadcast
lottery
advertising
about
any
state
lottery.
it
is
the
validity
of
that
bright
line
rule
that
is
at
issue
as
applied
to
respondent
in
this
case.
the
district
court
in
a
divided
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
held
this
regulatory
program
unconstitutional
under
the
commercial
speech
standard
this
court
adopted
in
the
central
hudson
case.
those
courts
reasoned
that
congress
had
legitimate
and
substantial
interests
involved
in
helping
the
states
pursue
their
policies
towards
gambling.
those
courts
also
concluded
that
this
regulatory
program
was
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
that
end.
nonetheless,
those
courts
held
these
statutes
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
respondent
on
the
ground
that
in
that
circumstance
it
did
not
directly
advance
congress'
goals.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
your
honor,
the
as-applied
type
of
challenge
that
i
think
the
court
contemplated
under
the
commercial
speech
basis
is
a
challenge
that
would
go
to
show
that
a
particular
broadcast
in
this
case
should
not
properly
be
treated
as
commercial
speech.
that
type
of
as-applied
challenge
can
always
be
brought.
we
don't
believe
that
these
statutes
should
be
construed
to
apply
to
editorials
and
news
stories.
in
fact
the
decree
entered
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
so
construed
the
statutes.
we
did
not
challenge
that
aspect
of
the
decree
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
you
don't.
both
precedent
from
this
court
and
reason
indicate
to
the
contrary.
first
the
precedent.
in
the
case
of--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--in
the
case
of
ward
v.
rock
against
racism
this
court
addressed
a
similar
argument.
in
that
case
people
were
using
the
band
shell
in
new
york
city
central
park.
the
city
had
a
regulation
that
was
treated
as
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
of
the
speech.
it
required
people
using
the
band
shell
to
use
city
equipment
and
have
a
city
employee
run
it.
the
city
had
this
regulation
in
place
to
serve
two
competing
goals,
competing
goals
much
like
the
competing
goals
at
issue
here.
it
was
to
insure
that
the
concerts
were
loud
enough
so
that
they
could
be
heard
by
concert
goers
but
not
so
loud
that
they
would
disrupt
the
surrounding
communities.
the
argument
that
was
made
on
behalf
of
rock
against
racism
is
that
regulation
doesn't
serve
its
purposes
as
applied
to
us
because
we're
loud
enough
so
that
everybody
hears
us.
there
is
no
need
to
worry
about
whether
or
not
that
goal
is
served.
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
the
court
said
that
the
validity
of
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
serves
on
the
general
purposes
that
the
government
seeks
to
serve
through
the
regulation
and
not
on
how
it's
applied
in
an
individual
case.
one
week
later
in
the
case
of
suny
v.
fox
this
court
said
that
the
analysis
under
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
is
substantially
similar
to
the
analysis
that
is
applied
in
the
commercial
speech
area.
we
think
the
combination
of
those
two
cases
as
a
matter
of
precedent
indicates
that
you
don't
look
at
a
station-by-station
approach,
you
don't
undertake
that
type
of
analysis
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
congress'
regulation
of
the
broadcast
spectrum
is
permissible.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
you
look
in
this
case
to
see
whether
the
legislative
judgment
is
reasonable.
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
central
hudson.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
it's
from
knowing
about
what
goes
on
in
virginia.
we're
not
seeking
to
suppress
general
information.
what
congress
has
sought
to
do
here
is
accommodate
the
conflicting
goals
of
virginia
and
north
carolina.
virginia
believes--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--north
carolina's
interest
in
not
having
its
citizens
participate
in
gambling.
north
carolina
doesn't
permit
private
lotteries
on
a
large
scale
basis,
it
doesn't
run
a
state
lottery,
because
it's
interest
is
in
not
having
north
carolinians
gamble.
that
is
the
interest
they
have--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--even
in
another
state
where
it's
lawful
because
they
bring
the
problems
back
home.
if
someone
goes
to
another
state
and
impoverishes
himself
he
comes
back
and
then
can
become
a
burden
on
the
citizens
who
don't
gamble.
so
north
carolina
has
an
interest
in
protecting
the
citizenry
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
both
against
the
harms
that
gambling
can
cause
to
participants
as
well
as
the
harms
that
gambling
can
cause
to
third
parties.
that
is
an
entirely
legitimate
interest
and
we
think
congress
can
reasonably
attempt
to
accommodate
the
interests
of
virginia
and
north
carolina
and
that
the
central
hudson
test
is
sufficiently
flexible
to
allow--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if
they
are
in
a
community
that
is
close
to
the
border
and
if
the
border
state
has
a
lottery,
as
it
does
here,
and
the
broadcast
airwaves
cross
state
lines,
as
they
do,
that
can
happen.
but
it
is
nonetheless
reasonable
for
congress
to
focus
its
statutes
on
the
geographic
lines
separating
lottery
from
non-lottery
states.
after
all,
stations
like
respondent's
stations
are
licensed
to
serve
a
community,
and
unless
they
serve
that
community
they
will
not
hold
onto
their
license.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i'm
told
by
the
fcc
that
on
average
there
is
a
50-mile
radius
for
broadcast
lottery,
for
broadcasters.
so
you
have
that
situation
which
therefore
can
repeat
itself
along
the
border
in
various
circumstances.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
a
condition,
and
in
fact
you
can
have
your
transmitter
located
in
a
different
state.
the
license
requires
you
to
serve
a
community,
in
this
case
the
community
is
the
elizabeth
city
community.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
where
it's
licensed
to.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
there's
an
argument
made
by
one
of
the
amici
that
you
can
treat
this
station
as
having
been
licensed
to
virginia
and
north
carolina,
and
there
is
utterly
no
factual
support
for
that
at
all.
the
complaint
filed
by
the
respondent,
the
stipulation
of
facts,
the
district
court
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
even
their
own
brief
in
this
court
all
concede
that
they
are
licensed
to
north
carolina.
the
reason
is
under
the
broadcast
regulations
that
are
in
effect
you
are
licensed
to
serve
a
community.
here
the
community
is
elizabeth
city,
north
carolina.
so
that
they
are
not
licensed
to
serve
virginia.
and
the
way
the
fcc
looks
at
it
is
this.
you
are
licensed
to
serve
that
community
and
it
is
your
responsibility
to
do
so.
if
you
do
so
you
are
satisfying
the
concerns
that
the
fcc
has
when
it
licenses
you.
if
by
chance
your
broadcasts
go
into
another
state,
that
is
not
a
problem
because
that's
just
physically
what
happens,
but
it
is
not
a
bonus.
you
are
required
to
serve
your
community,
and
here
the
community
is
in
a
state
that
has
a
state
policy
against
lotteries.
it
has
a
state
policy
against
lotteries
because
it
wants
to
dissuade
its
citizens
from
gambling.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
can
be
licensed
to
serve
an
area
that
includes
more
than
one
state.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
they
have
set
up
their
transmitter
north
of
elizabeth
city
so
that
it
is
close,
it
is
about,
you
could
say
midway
on
a
map
between
norfolk,
virginia
beach
and
elizabeth
city.
what
they
are
doing
in
essence
is
trying
to
serve
elizabeth
city
as
they
are
required
to
do
but
also
serve
the
interests
of
the
state
of
virginia
so
that
they
can
hopefully
sell
lottery
ads.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
the
actual
number
is
8
percent,
but
i'm
not
going
to
quibble
about
the
numbers.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
it's
fine
because
the
way
the
scheme
works
is
to
focus
on
where
you
license
the
service.
the
statute,
for
example,
requires
that
licenses
be
allocated
so
that
communities
are
served,
and
the
fcc--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide.
since
they
are
in
north
carolina,
since
congress
has
adopted
a
bright
line
rule,
and
since
it's
an
unavoidable
law
of
physics
that
the
broadcast
waves
will
cross
into
virginia,
it
is
our
position
that
while
that
happens--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
reason
i
disagree
is
you
use
the
term
authorized.
that's
not
the
way
the
scheme
works.
it's
not
as
if
they
are
given
the
authority
to
go
ahead
and
broadcast
into
virginia.
they
are
licensed
and
authorized
to
serve
elizabeth
city.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
if
their
broadcast--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
for
different
purposes.
in
other
words
they
are
authorized
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
different
federal
law
that
governs
licensing
and
it
doesn't
forbid
them
from
conducting
the
broadcasts
in
the
way
they
do
here.
they
are
not
authorized
in
the
sense
that
the
statutes
that
they
have
challenged
here
as
applied
to
them
permits
them
to
engage
in
this
type
of
activity.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
absolutely.
if
they--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
if
they
violate
this
law
they
can
not
only
be
criminally
prosecuted
under
title
18,
they
can
have,
when
their
license
comes
up
for
renewal
they
can
have
their
license
taken
away
from
them.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
that's
my
understanding,
that
you
could
have
a
situation
in
the
way
you
posit
it.
but
the
reason
it's
a
reasonable
scheme
here
is
that
different
states
have
adopted
their
policies
and
you
are
licensed
to
serve
a
community
within
that
state.
if
you
are
violating
the
laws
of
that
state
by
broadcasting
the
advertisements,
regardless
of
physically
where
they
actually
happen
to
emanate
from,
you
are
disserving
the
policies
of
the
state
that
you
are
licensed
by
the
fcc
to
serve.
that
is
one
of
the
key
ingredients
of
the
licensing
scheme.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
often?
i
wouldn't
say
it's
often,
but
what
i
would
say
is
this.
if
you
are
in
a
community
that
is
rather
sparsely
populated
it
probably
becomes
easier
to
obtain
a
license
to
serve
that
community
than
it
would
be
if
you
are
trying
to
seek
a
new
license
in
new
york
city,
for
example,
where
there
are
numerous
stations.
if
there
aren't
very
many
stations
in
the
area,
or
perhaps
if
there
are
none,
that
you
are
trying
to
serve,
it
becomes
that
much
easier
to
show
that
you
will
be
able
to
meet
a
need
in
that
community
that
is
not
now
being
met.
now,
what
you
can
have
in
a
situation
then
is
somebody
come
in
and
try
to
serve
the
interests
of
that
community
and,
if
you
will,
also
try
to
serve
perhaps
the
surrounding
community.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
i
have
been
through
it
but
i
haven't
stopped
off.
what
we
were
talking
about
is
the
second
point
that
i
hope
to
make
today,
which
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
reasonable
scheme,
and
the
central
hudson
test
reasonably
accommodates
that.
i
would
also,
however,
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
about
the
first
point
we
have
made
in
our
brief
which
is
that
for
purposes
of
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
lawful
gambling
should
not
be
treated
differently
from
illegal
gambling.
and
the
reason
is
gambling
is
one
of
a
small
category
of
unique
products
or
activities.
this
court
in
posadas
referred
to
these
sorts
of
activities,
such
as
the
consumption
of
alcohol
and
gambling
and
the
like.
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
they
are
activities
that
have
traditionally
been
deemed
harmful
to
participants
and
to
third
parties
and
for
which
there
always
seems
to
have
been
a
black
market
available.
because
they
are
deemed
harmful
to
individuals
in
society
the
society
has
always
attempted
to
regulate
them
heavily
and
sometimes
flatly
to
ban
them
altogether,
as
most
states
do
in
connection
with
casino
gambling.
in
some
instances,
however,
society
can
rationally
conclude
that
the
costs
of
a
flat
prohibition
are
too
injurious
for
society
to
bear,
and
as
the
result
the
appropriate
approach
to
undertake
is
the
one
that
professor
epstein
has
called
damage
control,
legalization
and
regulation
where
the
regulation
includes
a
ban
on
the
advertising
of
that
activity.
that
is
the
sort
of
approach
that
has
been
undertaken
for
example
with
respect
to
gambling,
with
respect
to
alcohol,
and
other
similar
matters.
it's
where
you
have
that
type
of
narrow
activity,
not
the
broad
range
of
activities
that
can
potentially
be
regulated
by
the
congress,
by
the
state
legislatures,
and
by
the
municipalities,
that
we
think
the
rationale
that
was
expressed
in
posadas
of
greater
includes
the
lesser
is
a
reasonable
rationale
to
apply.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
under
the
first
point
we
have
made
in
our
brief
you
would...
well,
you
could
read
central
hudson
but
wouldn't
get
very
far.
you
would
stop
at
step
1.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
you
would
say
that
this
activity
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
illegal
activity,
and
we
know
from
the
pittsburgh
press
case
and
central
hudson
that
that
wouldn't
be
protected.
if--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
we
would
then
go
on
and
say
that
what
the
courts
did
in
this
case
was
misapply
the
central
hudson
test.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
they
can
prohibit
interstate
travel
in
this
region.
they
can
prohibit--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it
depends
whether
they
brought
them
back
to
north
carolina.
i
mean,
for
example,
if
a
state
decriminalized
possession
of
marijuana,
an
adjacent
state
could
certainly
say
you
can't
travel
across
the
border
and
bring
it
back
simply
because
it's
legal
in
that
state.
but
a
state,
state
a
can't
regulate
what
happens
in
state
b.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
by
its
own
citizens.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
because
they
bring
the
harm
back
with
them.
if
state
a--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if
state
a
makes
it
a
crime
to
drink
alcohol
and
state
b
doesn't--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
can't
prohibit
them
from
travelling
to
north
carolina
to
purchase
a
ticket,
excuse
me,
to
virginia
to
purchase
a
ticket--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--because
north
carolina
and
congress
together
can
prohibit
interstate
transportation
of
lottery
tickets
and
other
items
that
would--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
but
congress
can
prohibit
the
virginia
lottery
from
operating
if
it
believes
that
the
interests
of
a
state
like
north--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--but
it
can,
and
that's
our
argument.
until
the
mid-seventies,
1974,
there
were
no--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
congress
can
achieve
the
greater
in
that
way,
but
they
can
achieve
the
greater
by
prohibiting
virginia
from
having
a
lottery.
and
in
that
way
they
would
satisfy
the
interests
of
north
carolina
in
making
sure
that
north
carolinians
can't
participate
in
what
is
now
an
illegal
lottery.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
couldn't.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
don't
have
that
power.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
that...
north
carolina
lacks
that
power.
congress
could
do
that.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
my
greater
includes
the
lesser
point
relies
on
the
combined
power
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
congress,
and
as
we
have
tried
to
lay
out
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
narrowly
can
be
applied
to
a
case
like
this
one.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
it
were
sent
through
the
mails.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
if
you
simply
had
a
distribution
that
didn't
affect
interstate
commerce
in
anyway--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
what
i'm...
my
argument
from
congress'
power
is
based
on
its
combined
powers
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
dealing
with
the
broadcast
spectrum
as
well
as
the
use
of
the
mails.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
newspaper
would
not
be
in
a
different
position
than
someone
who
just
printed
up
his
own
handbill,
and
congress
wouldn't
have
the
authority
simply
to
say
that
you
can't
print
up
a
handbill
at--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
that
you
could
prohibit
someone
from
running
general
stories
about
what
is
a
legal
activity
in
another
state.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
couldn't--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
congress
certainly
can.
i'm
not
sure
that
a
state
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
congress
is.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
what
i've
been
thinking
about
and
trying
to
focus
on.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
turning
to
the
first
amendment
part
of
it,
we
think
that
the
central
hudson
test,
as
i
said,
is
sufficiently
flexible
that
it
allows
this
sort
of
approach
that
we
have
here
to
be
undertaken.
the
essential
objection
raised--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
think
if
it's
illegal
in
north
carolina--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no.
north
carolina
can
prohibit
that
type
of
activity
because
it
is
illegal
in
that
state.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
there
are
certain
counties
in
nevada,
for
example,
that
have
legalized
prostitution.
i
don't
think
virginia
or
north
carolina
has
to
say
that
its
newspapers
can
advertise
legalized
prostitution
in
nevada.
the
first
amendment
doesn't
prohibit
them
from
undertaking
that
type
of
activity.
it
is
sufficiently
flexible
that
we
think
they
can
engage
in
the
type
of
regulation
that
we
have
discussed,
and
that
the
government
can
engage
in
this
type
of
regulation
here.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it's
an
activity
that
in
a
perfect
world
would
not
be
conducted
at
all.
in
a
less
perfect
world
congress
or
the
legislature
could
flatly
prohibit
it.
but
in
the
type
of
world
that
we
have
the
costs
sometimes
of
prohibiting
this
activity
are
too
great
because
of
all
the
harms
associated
with
the
black
market
to
allow
this
activity
to
be
undertaken.
as
the
result,
society
has
to
regulate
it
rather
than
prohibit
it.
that's
the
way
we
think
that
the
types
of
instances
that
are
discussed
in
posadas
can
reasonably
be
tied
together.
let
me
say
just
a
few
brief
words
about
the
central
hudson
test.
we
think
that
essentially
the
theory
adopted
by
the
lower
courts
and
urged
by
respondents
is
one
of
under-inclusiveness,
and
we
think
that
under
inclusiveness
theory
is
not
materially
different
from
the
one
that
was
rejected
in
the
metromedia
case
and
that
was
rejected
in
posadas
itself.
what
congress
has
sought
to
do
here
is
accommodate
competing
interests,
the
interests
of
virginia
and
north
carolina.
the
fact
that
the
fit
is
not
perfect
is
not
fatal
to
this
scheme.
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
it
only
has
to
be
reasonable.
and
it
does,
the
reasonableness
of
it
doesn't
have
to
be
defended
on
a
station-by-station
basis.
since
this
fit
is
reasonable
as
a
general
matter,
we
believe
that
it
is
reasonably--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
is
reasonable
because
you
are
licensed
to
serve
a
community.
if
you
are
serving
that
community
you
are
broadcasting
to
them.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
if
it
were--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
if
it
were
a
typical
station
we
would
still
defend
it.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
no,
that's
not
true.
it's
not...
it's
not
in
the
record--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--nor
have
they.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that
question
i
don't
think
arises
under
central
hudson.
what
arises
under
central
hudson
is
whether
it
is
reasonable,
and
we
believe
this
is
a
reasonable
scheme.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
is
their
burden
to
show
that
this
is
protected
speech.
after
that
we
have
a
burden
of
showing
that
this
is
reasonable.
we
believe
we
satisfied
that.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
don't
make
an
estoppel
or
a
waiver
type
of
argument.
we
do
think
we
win
under
central
hudson,
as
well
as
the
other
arguments
in
our
brief.
