mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
noting
that
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
ban
on
commercial
speech
that
is
wholly
ineffective
in
promoting
any
governmental
interest
when
applied
to
a
particular
speaker
violates
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
and
we
begin
with
the
notion
that
in
this
record
we
believe
we
have
established
that
as
applied
to
this
litigant
this
statute
is
wholly
ineffective
to
promote,
encourage,
foster
any
governmental
interest
of
any
kind,
any
interest
in
federalism,
or
promote
any
purpose.
and
the
question
for
this
court
is
whether
a
statute
that
as
applied
accomplishes
nothing
can
still
restrict
our
liberties.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
we
have
not,
we
have
challenged
this
statute
only
as
applied
to
edge.
we
have
followed
the
well
established--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--your
honor,
the
record
does
not
establish
that.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
i
would
respectfully
differ
and
note
that
what
we
established
in
the
brief
was
that
the
dominant
medium
was
television.
we
pointed
out
the
amount
of
time
that
people
listen
to
television,
the
saturation
of
advertisements
through
television.
we
proved
that
people
switch
radio
stations.
we
proved
the
other
radio
stations
that
saturated
this
area--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--i
would
respectfully
differ
by
saying
that
it
doesn't
serve
the
purpose
of
the
statute
if
they're
getting
the
same
advertisements
every
day
overwhelmingly
through
other
dominant
medium.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
well,
that
would
be
indeed
a
factual
question.
but
what
we
proved
in
this
record,
and
we
went
though...
in
a
very
fact-specific
inquiry
we
proved
they
were
listening
to
virginia
t.v.
stations,
they
were
getting
virginia
newspapers,
and
that
we
were
overlapped
by
the
other
virginia
radio
stations
that
were
running
the
lottery
advertisements.
there
is--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--justice
white,
your
point
is
well
taken
that
as
long
as
someone
listens
only
to
our
station
they
would
get
no
lottery--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--well,
that
would
certainly
be
true.
but
whether
that
marginal,
and
i
respectfully
submit
the
term
marginal,
furthering
of
any
interest,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
is
not
enough
of
a
furthering
of
any
governmental
interest
to
justify
a
total
regulation
of
speech.
because
what
we
proved
was
that
every
other
medium
that
was
carrying
lottery
advertisements
was
overlapping
us,
that
the
people
in
north
carolina
were,
in
the
words
of
the
fourth
circuit,
saturated
with
lottery
advertising,
advertisements,
and
that
it
did
not
further
any
governmental
purpose
to
say
that
one
speaker,
my
client,
could
not
say
what
every
other
single
speaker
that
we
were
competing
with
was
saying--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any,
that
that--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--generally...
they
certainly
would
want
to
spread
their
advertising
over
as
many
media
as
possible
with
the
view
that
that
gives
them
possibly
some
type
of
larger
audience.
but
there
is
no
demonstration
in
this
record
that
there
would
be
a
greater
quantity
of
advertisements,
a
greater
effectiveness
of
advertisements,
and
the
only--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--that
i
would
respectfully
submit
is
not
correct,
your
honor,
because
advertising
budgets
are
traditionally
fixed.
what
happened
here
and
would
almost
always
happen
is
that
the
virginia
lottery
merely
redistributed
their
budget.
they
didn't
buy
additional
advertisements.
most
people
select
advertising
based
on
formulas
as
to
effectiveness.
they
don't
increase
advertising
payments
because
there
are
more
advertising
mediums.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
whether
they're
reaching
people
they
would
not--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--they
would
like
to.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
yes,
sir.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
your
honor,
i
think
it's
true
they
think
they
are
getting
something
for
their
money.
they
are
getting
something
for
their
money.
whether
they
are
getting
additional
coverage
of
additional
people
is
open
to
question
and
was
certainly
not
established--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--well,
the
fact
that
they
want
to
have
as
many
stations
as
possible
carry
the
message
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
more
people
are
going
to
get
the
message
in
any
real
sense.
and
certainly
it
is
hypothetically
possible
that
there
are
people
in
north
carolina
who
listen
only
to
our
station
and
do
not
view
the
dominant
media,
which
is
television,
or
read
the
newspapers.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
well,
your
honor,
what's
wrong
with
it
is
the
fact
that
every
other
station
is
carrying
exactly
the
same
message.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
well,
it's
unreasonable
because
it
does
not,
it's
not
effective
in
promoting
any
governmental
interest
if
you
just
shut
one
person
up.
furthermore,
if
you--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
simply
by
accepting
an
fcc
license
that
we
leave
our
first
amendment
rights
at
the
door
or
that
we
are
prohibited
from
broadcasting
that
which
everyone
else
is
hearing
and
everyone
else
is
carrying
simply
because
we
are
licensed,
especially
where
the
economic
effect
is
to
deprive
the
station
of
the
ability
to
really
provide
effective
service.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
you
look
at
it
to
directly
advance...
central
hudson
uses
the
term
directly
advance,
which
in
my
mind
is
an
empirically-based
test
that
does
not
relate
to
the
nation.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
there
would
be
two.
in
the
linmark
case
you
specifically
looked
at
the
facts
in
that
case
distinguishing
a
sixth
circuit
case
based
upon
a
different
fact.
in
the
suny
case
this
court
specifically
said,
and
i
am
quoting
from
pages
475
and
476
of
that
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
however
whether
the
law
directly
advances
these
interests
and
whether
the
regulation
it
imposes
is
more
extensive
than
is
necessary
for
that
purpose.
as
noted
earlier,
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
those
determinations.
we
think
the
remand
was
correct
since
further
factual
findings
had
to
be
made.
now
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
only
way
you
could
make
factual
findings
on
a
specific
record
is
to
deal
with
the
individual
case
and
not
the
nation
as
a
whole.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
that
was
dealing
with
the
fourth
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test
which
does
have,
where
the
ward
v.
rock
against
racism
analysis
has
some
meaning.
ward
obviously
was
a
time,
place,
and
manner
case.
in
time,
place,
and
manner
cases
they
are
almost
always
effective.
you
really
don't
reach
the
third
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test.
in
dealing
with
the
fourth
prong
this
court
can
always
examine
to
see
whether
there
are
many
other
easier
alternatives.
if
you
see
there
are
many
other
easier
alternatives
that
more
rationally
meet
any
governmental
interest
you
can
then
reject
the
statute.
you
can
also
take
evidence
to
see,
as
was
done
in
the
discovery
network,
whether
in
fact
the
statute
is
narrowly
tailored.
but
in
regard
to
dealing
with
the
third
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
said
we
totally
ignore
the
facts
of
the
individual
case,
we
don't
care
about
the
individual
speaker,
because
this
court
has
wisely
recognized
that
speakers
do
have
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
well,
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
plain
that
in
reading
suny,
and
that
was
what
the
district
judge
did
because
it
came
out
immediately
prior
to
our
decision,
he
read
it
very
carefully.
it
would
seem
very
difficult
to
say
we're
going
to
have
factual
findings
in
this
context
about
the
nation
as
a
whole.
and
i
would
note
that
it
is
the
government
that
bears
the
burden
of
justifying
its
restraint
on
speech.
and
if
that,
even
if
that
were
the
test
it
would
be
the
government's
burden
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence
that
suggested
that
in
the
nation
as
a
whole
this
was
an
effective
program.
the
government
really
submitted
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
kind
that
i
can
find
suggesting
that
this
statutory
scheme
is
really
effective,
and
what
the--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--it
seems
to
me
if
the,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
test
is
directly
advanced.
this
court
has
placed,
i
believe
in
zauderer,
in
fox,
and
in
other
cases,
the
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
regulation
does
directly
advance
a
governmental
interest.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
places
a
burden
on
the
government
to
show
something,
and
that
something
i
would
suggest
according
to
suny
must
be
in
the
empirical
real
world--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--yes,
sir,
i
would
believe
that
once
you
established
that
the
speech
is
protected,
that
it
is
lawful,
and
that
it--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
believe
that
if
suny
was
sent
back
for
factual
findings,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
is
plainly
a
direction
to
the
trial
court
to
take
evidence
and
to
make
the
type
of
record
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
yes,
sir.
i
would
also
say
linmark
would
support
that
proposition
when
you
looked
at
the
specific
facts.
i
submit
to
you
that
empiricism
in
constitutional
analysis
is
very
important.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
well,
it...
i
would
not,
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
making
that
argument
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
if
you,
let
me
just...
the
reason
is,
the
difference
is
if
you
said
everyone
in
elizabeth
city
except
one
could
advertise
prostitution
i
would
be
here
making
the
very
same
argument
today,
and
especially
if
i
demonstrated
that
by
everybody
but
one
advertising
that
the
effect,
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
incremental
effect
to
banning
one
speaker
from
saying
that
which
every
other
speaker
in
the
world
was
saying.
i
regard
that
as
an
important
constitutional
principle,
that
the
government
cannot
say
who
is
going
to
speak
about
things
that
when
they,
the
speech
and
the
carrancy
of
speech
is
already
in
the
public
domain.
i
think
it
is--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--i
would
say
that
if
in
the
area
where
the
message
was
being
received
we
were
overlapped
by
every
other
station
carrying
the
same
message
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
interest
in
suppressing
our
station's
speech
because
the
governmental
interest
would
not
be
directly
advanced
by
shutting
up
one
speaker.
it
simply
has
no
direct
advancement
for
any
constitutional
purpose.
it
simply
becomes,
in
my
opinion,
a
naked
and
arbitrary
abuse
of
power
on
the
facts
of
that
case.
now
i
think
those
cases
are
very,
very
unlikely,
but
if,
if
the
government
is
going
to
license
everyone
else
but
one,
then
i
think
that
raises
an
important
and
indeed
significant
constitutional
issue.
and
i
think
if
it
is
established
that
by
taking
that
one
out
of
circulation
as
an
advertiser
that
you
do
not
accomplish
anything
in
terms
of
preventing
the
transmission
or
dissemination
of
the
message,
then
i
think
it
is
plainly
unconstitutional--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
station
that
would
have
the
type
of
overlap
that
we
do,
your
honor.
there
may
be
such
a
station,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
station
having
such
an
overlap
where--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--i'm
sure
they
may...
the
other
north
carolina
stations
may
well
cover
areas
that
we
do
not
cover--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--i
would
think
so,
although
my
expectation
is
in
thinking
about
the
market
as
i
know
it
is
these
markets
generally
run
around
the
big
metropolitan
areas,
so
that
the
norfolk-portsmouth-virginia
beach
market,
which
includes
edge,
covers
that
area
of
north
carolina.
there
are
other
stations
that
are
further
away
that
also
cover
them,
but
they
don't
reach
any
part
of
virginia.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
no,
sir,
i
did
not
intend
to
say
that.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
we
have
not
submitted
based
on
the
fourth
prong,
even
though
we
have
raised
the
fourth
prong.
our
position
has
been
essentially
that
the
third
prong
is
an
empirical
test,
that
it
requires
proof
that
it
directly
advances
the
governmental
interest
in
an
individual
case,
and
that
we
assume
the
burden
of
proving
it
did
not.
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
we
met
the
burden
of
showing
that
as
applied
to
edge
the
statute--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
were
going
to
argue
that
my
position
would
be
that
any
bright
line
test
has
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
being
narrowly
tailored,
and
that
if
you
really
were
going
to
do
it
in
a
narrow
tailoring
fashion--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
justice
souter,
as
i
remember
your
question
it
was
asking
about
the
fourth
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test,
and
i
was
starting
to
reply
to
say
that
it
would
obviously
be
more
rational
and
more
effective
to
utilize
the
audience
served
as
opposed
to
the
station
of
license.
if
you
wanted
to
prevent
north
carolinians
from
receiving
advertisements
the
government
obviously
could
prohibit
the
advertisements
being
broadcast
to
stations
with
audiences
in
north
carolina.
as
you
are
aware,
the
fcc
license
has
a
filing
that
demonstrates
both
the
strength
of
the
signal
and
the
area
covered,
and
you
can
determine
the
audience
from
that
if
you
wanted
to
with
some
degree
of
precision.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
i
think
it
is
to
the
extent
that
it
picks
up
stations
like
edge
where
it
has
no
effect
or
it
doesn't
accomplish
any
governmental
purpose.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
i
have
conceded
that
my
primary
argument
is
that
it
is
ineffective,
but
if
you
were
to,
as
i
read
the
discovery
network
case
that
just
came
down
2
weeks
ago,
i
believe
even
there
that
statute
was
effective
as
to
about
100
out
of
the
3,000,
or
169
out
of
the
3,000
new
racks,
and
that
still
was
a
poor
fit.
so
the
fact
that
it
has
some
marginal
effect,
i
don't
know
if
that
saves
it.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
your
honor,
we
have
not
challenged
the
application
of
the
statute
as
it
applies
in
other
areas
where
you
do
not
have
the
particular
type
of
overlap
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
limited
our
challenge
to
an
as-applied
as
opposed
to
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
and
it's
certainly
the
way
that
this
court
has
always
approached
constitutional
questions.
there
are
any
number
of
cases
where
this
court
has
said
that
you
look
at
the
statute
as
it
is
applied
to
a
particular
litigant
to
determine
its
constitutionality
as
to
that
litigant.
there
are
cases
that
say
that's
a
wise
and
beneficent
policy
because
it
allows
this
court
not
to
overturn
more
of
the
statute
than
is
necessary.
there
are
any
number
of
cases
we
cited
in
the
brief
where
this
court
has
overturned
the
application
of
a
statute
as
applied
to
a
particular
litigant
while
it
has
allowed
the
statute
to
be
applicable
as
to
other
litigants.
the
fact
that
a
statute
may
in
general
serve
a
governmental
purpose
does
not
mean
that
on
specific
facts
and
on
a
specific
record
the
statute
cannot
have
unconstitutional
applications.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
in
a
facial
challenge
this
court
has
said
that
it
defers
to
a
legislative
judgment.
what
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
said
is
that
if
a
litigant
proves
that
in
a
specific
case
the
legislative
judgment
does
not
apply
and
the
statute
is
really
ineffective
on
a
real
record
with
real
evidence
that
the
statute
can
be
applied
to
that
case.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
that
would
be
my
belief,
yes.
that
is
the
teaching
that
i
believe
this
court
has
said
when
you
struck
down
filing
fees
for
indigents
you
did
so
not
because
filing
fees
are
unconstitutional
in
99.9
percent
of
the
cases
but
because
as
applied
to
that
individual
class
of
litigants
it
was
unconstitutional.
when
you
struck
down
the
solicitation
rules
in
naacp
v.
button
you
did
not
strike
the
lawyer
solicitation
rules
down
in
general.
it
is
a
well
established,
i
suggest,
rule
of
this
court
that
you
can
look
at
a
specific
record
and
look
at
the
application
of
a
statute
to
a
specific
litigant
and
protect
that
litigant's
constitutional
rights--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
that
type
of
test
would
work.
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
specific
facts.
but
if--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--i
did
make
that
submission,
and
the
only
reason
i
did
not
endorse
that
example
is
that
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
facts
in
a
record
to
see
whether
it
was
effective.
if
it
was
totally
ineffective,
if
you
said
everyone
can
have
billboards
except
one
person,
and
if
you
were
going
to
have
10,000
billboards
anyway
and
you
were
banning
20
additional
ones,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
real
problem.
i
think
it's
very
important
in
an
as-applied
challenge,
and
we
tried
very
carefully
to
say
this,
to
stick
to
the
record
as
made.
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
that
is
not
our
submission,
your
honor.
what
we
submitted
and
proved
to
the
trial
court
was
if
we
could
assume
the
burden
of
proving
complete
ineffectiveness,
that
is
we
were
totally
overlapped
by
virtually
every
dominant
information
source,
then--
mr.
conrad
moss
shumadine
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
concede
8
percent.
the
fact
that
you
reach
some
north
carolina
people--
