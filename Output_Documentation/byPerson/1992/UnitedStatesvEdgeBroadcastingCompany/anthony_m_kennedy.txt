was
it
a
condition
of
licensure
that
the
transmitter
be
located
in
north
carolina?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
we
know
that
this
is
a
north
carolina
station,
because
of
where
its
principal
office
is
located
or
where
its
transmitter
is
located?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
more
question
of
a
preliminary
nature.
does
the
fcc
ever
license
for
an
inter-state
community,
say
the
washington
metropolitan
area
or
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
often
true
that
you're
licensed
to
a
community
that
contains
only
4
to
5
percent
of
your
listening
audience?
that
seems
very
strange
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
under
your
submission,
i
take
it,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
could
forbid
a
north
carolina
newspaper
from
running
a
virginia
lottery
ad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
my
hypothetical
is
that
just
no
newspaper
that
buys
its
newsprint
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
is
located
in
a
state
which
prohibits
the
lottery
can
advertise
some
other
state's
lottery.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
accept
my
hypo...
i'm
trying
to
explore
whether
or
not
your
position
is
based
on
your
powers
over
an
fcc
licensee
as
opposed
to
any
other
media
of
communication.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
what
about
regulating
the
newspaper?
what's
the
difference
from
a
first
amendment
standpoint?
because
you
don't
license
newspapers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
an
interstate
paper
that
buys
its
paper
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
was
advertisements.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why?
because
of
clear
and
present
danger?
what's
the
rationale
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
distinguish
the
government's
citation
of
ward
v.
rock
against
racism
and
its
argument
that
the
validity
of
the
statute
depends
on
the
relation
it
bears
to
the
overall
problem
the
government
seeks
to
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
can
ban
billboards
on
the
grounds
that
we
want
to
improve
the
looks
of
a
city,
but
then
a
billboard
company
comes
in
and
says
look,
we're
in
a
very
shabby
part
of
the
city,
the
place
is
a
mess
anyway,
it
doesn't
really
make
that
much
difference.
they
would
be
exempt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
your
submission
was
that
if
the
statute
does
not
serve
the
interest
in
the
particular
case,
that
that
particular
litigant
can
challenge
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
your
submission,
mr.
larkin,
that
there
is
a
waiver,
an
estoppel
aspect
to
this
case,
to
speak
in
loose
terms,
that
this
licensee
really
submitted
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
north
carolina
and
is
stuck
by
its
license,
or
does
that
drop
out
of
the
case
and
this
is
simply
a
case
in
which
you
win
under
central
hudson?
