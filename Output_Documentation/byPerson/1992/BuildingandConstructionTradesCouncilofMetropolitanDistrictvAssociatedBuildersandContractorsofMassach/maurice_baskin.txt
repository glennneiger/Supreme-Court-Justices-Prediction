mr.
maurice
baskin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
arguments
you
have
just
heard
violate
the
most
fundamental
principles
of
labor
law
preemption.
this
court
has
consistently
held
over
the
years
that
the
cornerstone
of
the
act
is
the
collective
bargaining
process
between
private
employers
and
private
unions,
and
that
it
is
off
limits
for
government
to
interfere
in
that
process
by
dictating
the
outcome
of
the
negotiations.
and
that's
exactly
what
has
happened
here.
the
mwra
has
not
only
told
us,
our
members,
who
we
have
to
bargain
with,
but
they
have
eliminated
the
bargaining.
they
have
told
us
the
outcome
of
the
agreement
and
they
have
eliminated
any
ability
on
the
part
of
these
contractors
to
use
whatever
economic
weapons
might
be
available
to
them.
that's
the
heart
of
the
machinists
doctrine.
there
can
be
no
more
blatant
direct
interference
than
what
has
happened
here.
and
all
we
have
heard--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--only
for
private
employers,
a
crucial
difference.
a
crucial
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
maurice
baskin
that
is
the
issue,
your
honor.
what
we
have
heard
and
what
we
have
seen
in
the
briefs
is
the
other
side
is
saying
that
well,
a
private
employer
could
do
it,
so
why
can't
the
government.
the
reason
is
that
the
government
is
different.
the
reason
is
that
8(e)
does
not
include
governments
within
the
exceptions
that
are
created
for
private
employers.
the
plain
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
8(d)
says,
express
language,
that
the
government
shall
not
compel
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
private
employers
and
private
unions.
so
where
is
the
exception
from
8(d)
that's
created
by
8(e)?
it's
certainly
not
in
the
language
of
8(e)
because
8(e)
does
not
even
refer
to
state
public
political
subdivisions.
so
8(e)
is
not
an
exception
on
its
face
to
8(d).
they
have
said
well,
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
8(e),
it
shows
that
there
used
to
be
some
of
these--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--8(d)
is
cited,
h.k.
porter
is
mentioned,
the
case
in
which
this
court--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--you
will
find
it
right
next
to
the
citation
to
h.k.
porter.
it
is
also
cited
on
18,
pages
18
and
22
is
the
reference
to
h.k.
porter
which
of
course
is
the
seminal
case
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
maurice
baskin
i'm
sorry
if
the
text
of
8(d)
is
omitted.
i
apologize
for
that
omission,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
baskin
and
if
it's
not
referred
to...
actually
it's
cited.
page
22
is
the
cite
to
8(d)
itself,
which
is
stated
in
footnote
12,
22.
it
has
been
interpreted
as
an
express
prohibition.
the
actual
language
of
8(d)--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
apologize
for
that
omission
except
that
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
a
number
of
times
and
by
reference
to
h.k.
porter
it
was
felt
that
it
was
set
forth
for
the
court.
it
was
only
raised
as
the
alternative
to
what
we
have
heard
from
the
other
parties
that
8(e)
is
somehow
a
great
exception
that
is
created
to
permit
this
type
of
activity.
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
that
point,
that
8(e)
is
created
only
as
a,
something
to
deal
with
relations
between
private
employers
on
a
voluntary
basis
and
unions.
it
says
nothing
about
public
employers.
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
of
8(e)
one
will
find
no
reference
to
a
union
only
project
agreement
imposed
by
a
public
employer.
and
i
would
like
to
address
some
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
court
about
the
status
of
the
mwra
with
regard
to
this
agreement.
the
fact
is
the
mwra's
participation
was
indispensable
to
the
enforcement
of
this
agreement.
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
fox
i
believe
you
will
notice,
this
was
the
mwra's
own
official,
that,
and
the
affidavit
of
the
kaiser
people.
they
admit
that
they
told
the
unions
up
front
that
the
agreement
could
not
be
enforced
without
the
mwra's
approval.
that
was
established
from
the
outset.
it's
a
matter
of
state
law.
this
area
is
pervasively
regulated
by
massachusetts
law,
and
what
does
massachusetts
law
say?
it
says
there
must
be
free
and
open
competition,
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
state
agency
has
achieved
here.
instead
the
mwra
went
ahead
and
approved
this
and
then
put
the
bid
specification
into
place.
without
13.1,
we
have
just
heard
from
the
solicitor
general,
the
agreement
could
not
have
been
enforced.
so
to
pretend
that
this
is
an
agreement
between
private
parties
is
simply
to
ignore
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
maurice
baskin
the
effect
of
that
negotiation,
yes,
we
do.
to
the
extent
kaiser
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
agency
and
the
agreement
was
essentially
null
and
had
no
effect,
it
is
really
two
sides
of
the
same
coin,
your
honor.
i
should
also
note
it
has
been
made
reference
that
the
nlrb
somehow
approved
this
agreement.
the
nlrb
has
never
looked
at
this
agreement.
the
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb
in
an
advisory
memorandum
opinion,
in
which
he
was
told
that
kaiser
was
not
acting
as
the
mwra's
agent,
a
false
assumption,
failed
to
issue
a
complaint.
it
has
been
stated
in
numerous
cases
that
has
no
precedential
authority
whatsoever.
but
we
did
not
pursue
the
nlrb
avenue
because
we
don't
view
this
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
view
this
as
a
situation
of
preemption,
that
is
that
the
state
is
interfering
with
the
careful
balance
struck
by
congress
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
the
starting
point--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--we
have
raised
both
garmon
and
golden
state
machinists
type
preemption.
mr.
maurice
baskin
we
are
going
both
tracks,
your
honor.
section
7
rights
are
also
being
affected
here,
an
area
that's
arguably,
certainly
is
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
again
the
response
that
we've
heard
is
that
8(e),
8(e)
somehow
permits
this
intrusion
on
the
section
7
rights,
and
again
8(e)
only
permits
it
for
private
employers.
that
is
what
is
crucial
to
the
case.
so
both
tracks
are--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
employer
is
defined
in
section
2(2)
of
the
act,
which
is
referenced,
and
all
sides
admit
that
the
mwra
is
not
an
employer.
it's
not
even
a
question
of
ambiguity.
mr.
maurice
baskin
right.
and
that's
the
only
way
that
which
8(e)
could
use
the
term
employer,
so
this
is
simply
not
a
question
that
the
other
side
has
attempted
to
debate.
they
have
attempted
to
say
instead
that
one
should
make
an
analogy
to
8(e).
but
when
one
has
the
starting
point
that
this
court
has
established
and
that
congress
established,
then
with
that
starting
point
that
interference
by
the
government
is
not
permitted,
then
it's
incumbent
on
them
to
come
forward
with
more
than
analogies.
it's
incumbent
on
them
to
come
forward
with
language,
statutory
language
that
somehow
creates
the
great
exception,
the
radical
exception
that
they
are
attempting
to
promote
here.
because
it
is
truly
radical.
if
you
open
the
door
for
this
type
of
conduct
by
the
state
agencies,
with
all
of
the
many
procurement
activities
that
the
states
and
the
federal
government
go
through,
it
will
create
a
huge
hole
in
the
preemption
doctrine.
and
that's
what
this
court
recognizes
in
the
unanimous
opinion
in
the
gould
case.
mr.
maurice
baskin
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
is
it's
not
a
large
hole
at
all.
we
have
not
raised
any
objection
about
the
state
establishing
all
kinds
of
conditions,
whatever
they
deem
necessary
to
complete
their
project
on
time.
it
is
done
all
the
time
with
all
kinds
of
stabilization
agreements.
the
only
very
narrow
thing
that
is
prohibited
is
for
them
to
tell
contractors
that
they
must
have
a
union
agreement
and
thereby
force
their
employees
to
join
unions,
which
is
not
something
that
is
in
fact
necessary
to
achieve
the
completion
of
the
job.
but
perhaps
the
best
place
to
look
is
to
the
statute
and
to
what
congress
said.
congress
made
no
attempt
to
create
this
special
exception
for
the
states.
and
in
fact
the
uniform
state
law
based
on
the
state
court
decisions
that
we
did
cite
in
our
brief
and
were
not
responded
to
by
the
other
side,
in
the
1950's
was
this
was
beyond
the
pale
for
state
governments
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
activity.
the
several
activities
when
it
was
raised
to
the
state
court
they
said
no,
you
cannot
as
a
state
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
union
activities.
and
presumably
congress,
aware
of
that
law,
uniform
law
throughout
the
states,
made
no
effort
to
change
the
law
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
seems
likely
then,
the
legislative
history
shows,
that
congress
meant
for
the
situation
to
stay
exactly
as
it
was
and
as
it
has
been
for
the
years
since.
because
notwithstanding
these
arguments
that
we
have
seen
in
some
of
these
briefs,
these
types
of
project
agreements
are
quite
rare
in
the
government
sector,
and
they
are
not
all
that
common
in
the
private
sector.
we
represent
an
association
that
performs
work
on
hundreds
of
thousands
of
projects
around
the
country,
next
to
unions,
working
with
unions,
and
some
non-union,
some
mixed,
and
these
projects
manage
to
get
built.
we
put,
in
the
record
is
a
stabilization
agreement
that
shows
how
the
maryland
harbor
tunnel
was
built
with
no
union
only
requirement
in
it.
so
the
fact
is
that
the
states
could
achieve
their
legitimate
objectives
if
they
have
them
in
connection
with
procurements
without
getting
into
the
illegitimate
sphere
of
prohibited
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
process.
again,
as
long
as
the
court
recalls
that
that
is
the
basic
principle
of
preemption,
that
the
states
should
stay
out
of
dictating
collective
bargaining
agreements,
everything
else
from
this
case
logically
achieves
our
result.
mr.
maurice
baskin
oh,
a
stabilization
agreement
may
be
a
discussion
about
certain
terms
that
should
apply--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--absolutely.
it's
the
results
of
the
discussion--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--well,
in
particular--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--it
typically
is
between
the
contracting
agency
and
all
the
parties
who
are
going
to
participate
in
the
contract.
it
might
deal
with
such
things
as
resolving
disputes
about
how
the
project
is
being
built--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--it
might
deal
with
wages.
of
course
many
states
have
prevailing
wage
laws.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
but
in
fact
our
issue,
we
do
not
take--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--no,
not...
well,
that
is
one
thing
but
it's
not
the
most--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes,
it
very
well
may.
and
we
don't
object
to
that.
that
is
not
the...
this
is
a
prevailing
wage
job.
by
state
statute
there
is
going
to
be
a
set
wage,
and
so
that
part
of
it
is
not
necessary,
there
is
no
need
for
an
agreement
to
achieve
that.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
the--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--not
necessarily.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no.
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
necessarily
what
a
stabilization
agreement
calls
for.
mr.
maurice
baskin
does
it
ever?
a
stabilization
agreement
could
call
for
a
certain
wage
rate.
if
the
union
cares
to
negotiate
a
higher
wage
rate
the
government
will
certainly
accept
that,
it
just
won't
pay
for
it.
so
that's
really
how
those
agreements
can
work.
but
as
i
say,
wages
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
because
it
is
governed
by
a
state
law
that
is
already
mandating
what
the
wages
are.
and
i
think
it's
also
important
to
understand
that
if
this
were
simply
dealing
with
some
peripheral
aspect
of
labor
relations
we
would
not
be
before
you,
there
would
not
be
an
issue.
the
court
has
already
said
that
certain
items,
like
unemployment
insurance
and
the
like,
are
permissible
for
the
state
to
go
after.
but
here
they're
going
after
the
entire
collective
bargaining
process.
that
makes
it
fundamentally
different
from
any
case,
fundamentally
worse
than
any
case
that
has
been
before
you
before.
and
the
parties
on
the
other
side
have
not
seen
fit
to
acknowledge
that
grave
difficulty
from
the
outset
of
their
case,
and
it's
crucial
to
the
outcome.
mr.
maurice
baskin
yes.
membership
in
the
union
is
not
the
critical
feature.
it
is
a,
it
follows
automatically
from
the
fact
they
required
us
to
sign
the
agreement.
and
these
agreements
already
had
the
language
in
them.
we
weren't
permitted
to
negotiate
about
how
many
days
it
would
take
for
someone
to
have
to
join
the
union,
that's
already
established.
so
by
signing
the
agreement
we
are
in
fact
being
forced
to
have
our
employees
who
have
not
voted
for
or
chosen
the
union
to
sign
up
with
the
union
in
order
to
perform
in
this
government
project.
and
that
simply
cannot
be.
so
what
we
have
here
is
with
the
starting
point
of
the
interference,
direct,
uncontested
interference
with
the
bargaining
process,
in
fact
elimination
of
the
bargaining
process.
the
only
excuses
for
that
that
we
have
heard
are
that
private
employers
can
do
it,
that's
irrelevant
to
the
analysis,
that
there
should
be
a
proprietary
distinction
as
opposed
to
regulation,
this
court
unanimously
said
that
was
not
a
pertinent
analysis
where
there
was
the
type
of
interference
that
we
have
here,
and
i
should
add
that
this
in
fact
is
a
regulation.
it's
at
least
a
mixture
of
proprietary
action
and
regulation.
if
one
looks
at
the
massachusetts
state
law
definition
of
regulation
which
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
utility
contractors
association
at
page
19,
a
regulation
under
state
law
is
a
requirement
imposed
by
an
agency
to
implement
the
law
enforced
or
administered
by
it.
and
that's
what
has
happened
here.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
because
this
is
an
action
of
the
state
agency
it
is
certainly
an
appropriate
place
to
look
as
to
whether
or
not--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes,
and
whether
or
not
this
is
regulation
or
proprietary
action
is,
what
i'm
simply
suggesting
is
that
it
is
not
an
open
and
shut
case
as
to
whether
or
not
this,
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
federal
definition
of
what
constitutes
such
a
regulation
in
this
particular
context.
it
would
seem
to
be
an
appropriate
place
to
look.
but
we
don't
rely
on
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
regulation
or
a
proprietary
action.
it's
clear
to
us
and
it
was
clear
to
this
court
that
state
agencies
can't
claim
the
license
by,
because
of
proprietary
actions
to
interfere
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
maurice
baskin
we
do
not
agree
with
the
conclusion
the
way
they
phrased
it,
and
in
fact
we
are,
we
responded
to
it
in
our
brief.
and
the
response
is
that
the
city
would
be
free
to
get
the
service
provided,
and
it
would
be
free
to
insist
that
the
golden
state
people
provide
the
service
or
they
would
have
to
look
elsewhere.
but
in
golden
state
and
here,
here
they
have
not
given
us
the
opportunity
to
perform.
mr.
maurice
baskin
and
if
they
conditioned
their
finding
on
our
settlement
of
the
labor
dispute
that
would
be
impermissible,
because
that
is
what
golden
state
held.
if
they
said
we
have
to
make,
we
need
transportation
provided
or
we
need
the
project
built,
show
us
that
you
can
provide
the
service,
then
that
would
be
permissible.
here
they
haven't
given
us
that
opportunity,
and
for
them
to
say
that...
of
course
we
have
no
labor
dispute
at
all,
but
for
them
to
say
that
we
think
it's
a
priori
that
with
a
labor
dispute
you
won't
be
able
to
finish,
that
simply
cannot
be
done
because
then
they
are
directly
interfering
with
the
bargaining
process.
mr.
maurice
baskin
because
congress
has
established
the
rules
for
labor
relations,
and
for
exactly
that
reason,
that
it
should
not
be
something
that
every
state
and
local
government
gets
into.
it's
not
the
state
or
local
government's
business
how
the
contractor
establishes
relations
with
its
employees.
if
the
contractor
can't
perform
because
of
that
dispute,
then
the
state
has
the
right
to
go
elsewhere.
mr.
maurice
baskin
it
is
conceivable
that
the
state
could
make
such
a
reasoned
judgment
based
on
hearings
and
actual
facts
being
provided
to
the
state
independent
of
a
simple
blanket
policy
that
those
who
don't
have
unions
cannot
perform.
that's
possible
that
that
could
happen.
but
here
there
were
no
hearings.
there
in
fact
are
no
facts
before
you,
even
in
the
affidavits,
that
this
project
cannot
be
performed.
there
are
only
statements
that
it
was
inconvenient
or
somewhat
annoying
to
have
to
establish
the
necessary
reserved
entrances
and
debate
with
people
about
how
certain
things
should
be
accomplished.
no
actual
statement
or
finding
of
fact,
certainly
in
no
proceeding,
that
this
type
of
project
could
not
be
performed.
instead
what
we
have
is
a
blanket
exclusion
of
non-union
contractors,
and
i
might
add
a
blanket
statement
to
the
union
contractors
that
they
are
bound
by
these
agreements
whether
they
are
disadvantageous
to
those
contractors
or
not.
and
when
those
agreements
come
up
for
renewal,
a
tremendous
leverage
given
to
the
unions
in
that
area
because
of
the
government's
interference
with
the
bargaining
process.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
ironically
the
8(e)
argument
we
have
heard
is
that
it
was
designed
for
short-term
projects
rather
than
long-term
projects.
but
the
state
can
take
other
actions
to
prevent
disruption.
the
bidding
statute
that
this
state
is
operating
under
requires
that
a
bidder
demonstrate
that
it
is
qualified
to
perform.
and
all
the
states
have
procurement
laws
that
are
designed
to
promote
open
competition,
at
the
same
time
guaranteeing
to
the
states
the
ability
to
get
their
jobs
done.
so
the
states
already
have
that
power,
they
already
have
that
right,
and
congress
has
said
that
they
cannot
achieve
those
ends
not
only
because
they're
not
necessary
but
because
it
interferes
with
the
federal
scheme.
and
in
fact
it
would
become
a
constant
abuse
of
the
federal
scheme.
we
have
not
only
seen
it
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
this
$5
billion
central
artery
project
right
behind
it,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
briefs
or
the
arguments
of
the
other
side
that
is
going
to
stop
this
from
applying
to
a
$15
million
project
on
a
power
line
or
any
number
of
other
situations.
it
will
bring
the
courts
into
making
this
decision
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
i
suppose,
about
when
has
the
state
demonstrated
a
significant
need
to
avoid
disruption.
well,
it's
not
supposed
to
make
that
determination,
the
state
agency,
based
on
the
labor
relations
policies
of
the
contractors.
that's
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case.
the
state
has
many
other
ways
of
achieving
its
legitimate
goals,
but
it's
not
a
legitimate
objective
to
exclude
the
majority
of
the
construction
industry
that
happens
to
be
non-union,
as
is
in
the
briefs.
only
20
percent
of
the
union
members
in
this,
of
the
workers
in
this
country
are
union
members.
somehow
projects
are
getting
built,
and
in
fact
they
are
getting
built
because
they
can
be
done
with
mixed
use
projects,
it
can
be
done
without
local
government
interference
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
maurice
baskin
they
work.
mr.
maurice
baskin
no,
congress
felt
a
need
to
encourage
and
adjust
the
relations
between
private
employers
and
unions.
that's
of
course
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
only
applies
to
private
employers
and
unions.
and
if
they
were
so
concerned
about
the
ability
of
public
owners
to
have
this
privilege
that
the
nwra
seeks,
then
they
surely
would
have
passed
the
public
owner
privileges
act
that
would
have
allowed
the
kind
of
interference
that's
going
on
here.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
they
made
this
one
exception
because
of
statements
that
were
made
and
hearings
that
were
held
about
the
need
for
this
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
maurice
baskin
they
made
that
finding
based
on
the
need
for
voluntariness,
and
they
were
quite
specific
about
it.
this
is
not
a
government
coerced
function
but
a
voluntary
relationship
in
the
private
sector,
and
based
on
the
big
difference
between
the
private
and
the
public
sectors.
they
could
count
on
market
forces
to
dictate
to
these
private
contractors
when
it's
good
or
bad.
those
forces
don't
apply
to
a
public
entity
that
has
got
taxpayer
dollars.
mr.
maurice
baskin
exactly.
mr.
maurice
baskin
it
certainly
would
not
raise
a
federal
preemption
issue.
that's
in
fact
the
question--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--whether
it
would
be
valid
under
8(e),
he
must
be
an
employer
in
the
construction
industry.
on
the
other
hand,
whether
the
act
would
even
apply
to
that
situation
because
he
is
not
an
employer
would
be
a
different
question
to
which
i
just
don't
have
any
definitive
position.
mr.
maurice
baskin
right.
unregulated
by
the
government.
mr.
maurice
baskin
unregulated
by
the
government.
mr.
maurice
baskin
exactly.
mr.
maurice
baskin
exactly.
mr.
maurice
baskin
but
only
for
the
relationships
between
private
employers
and
private
unions.
mr.
maurice
baskin
well,
what
machinists
says
and
what
golden
state
said
was
there
was
a
free
zone
around
the
collective
bargaining
process.
that's
the
point.
and
so
the
reason
why
it's
important
that
8(e)
doesn't
create
a
special
exception
for
the
states
is
because
it
has
already
been
established
that
they
cannot
coerce
employers--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--it
certainly
does
not
create
any
new
government
power
to
impose
collective
bargaining.
8(d)
and
h.k.
porter
and
machinists
and
golden
state,
they
all
say
the
government
can't
coerce
collective
bargaining.
does
8(e)
create
an
exception
from
that?
no,
no.
8(e)
regulates
only
in
the
sense
that
it
creates
a
voluntary,
it
permits,
it
permits
conduct--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--yes,
it
did.
it
created
a
free
zone
from
government
interference
for
collective
bargaining.
not...
we're
not
suggesting
a
free
zone
from
private
discussions
of
collective
bargaining
or
private
agreements
or
private
economic
weapons.
in
fact
the
court
has
said
those
should
be
protected
too,
and
we're
comfortable
with
that.
if
this
were
a
private
agreement
between
an
employer
in
the
construction
industry
and
the
unions
we
would
not
be
before
you.
but
here
the
issue
is
can
the
government
step
in
and
become
a
party
to
the
negotiations,
and
in
fact
those
exact
words
were
used
in
golden
state
and
the
answer
was
no.
we
urgently
plead
that
the
same
answer
be
achieved
in
this
case.
mr.
maurice
baskin
8(d)
says
that
no
employer
shall
be
obligated
to
accept
an
agreement
agreed
to,
a
specific
agreement
with
the
union.
and
that
has
been
interpreted
in
h.k.
porter
to
mean
that
the
government
shall
not
require
any
employer
to
adopt
a
union--
mr.
maurice
baskin
--well,
in
fact.
mr.
maurice
baskin
by
the
government.
mr.
maurice
baskin
by
the
government.
and
this
court
relied
expressly
on
8(d)
in
the
golden
state
case
to
say
that
means
both
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government.
certainly
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
can't
do
it,
how
can
it
be
that
the
states
could
do
it?
the
answer
is
that
it
cannot
be.
thank
you.
