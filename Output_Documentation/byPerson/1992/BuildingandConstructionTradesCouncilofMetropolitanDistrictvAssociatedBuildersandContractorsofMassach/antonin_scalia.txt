mr.
fried,
suppose
a
state
decides
that
it
wants
to
assure
all
its
contracts
a
degree
of
security
so
it
provides
that
all
state
contracting
must
be
done
with
union
contractors.
would
that
be
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
look
to
the,
just
the
face
of
the
law
in
question
or
do
we
have
to
investigate
the
intent
of
the
legislators
in
each
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
how
important
is
it
to
the
government's
position
that
this,
you
make
a
lot
of
it
in
your
brief,
that
the
state
is
really
just
implementing
an
agreement
between
kaiser?
what
if
the
state
itself
had
decided
to
do
its
own
general
contracting?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
essential
to
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
the
state
itself
had
been--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
always
allowed
under
8(e)
and
8(f),
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
you
also
create
an
enormous
hole
in
the
ability
of
the
government
to
contract
itself
instead
of
letting
things
be
done
by
the
private
sector.
if
it's
acknowledged
that
(e)
and
(f)
is
really
necessary
for
these
massive
construction
projects
to
be
done,
by
not
permitting
(e)
and
(f)
to
apply
to
the
states
you
essentially
are
saying
that
this
all
has
to
be
done
by
private
enterprise
and
the
state
cannot
undertake
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
baskin,
two
questions.
if
what
you
say
is
true,
how
do
you
explain
the
enactment
of
8(e)
and
8(f)?
i
mean,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--congress
was
deluded
to
believe
the
opposite
of
what
you
have
just
told
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
generally
they
wouldn't
allow
private
employers,
generally,
to
coerce
union
membership
this
way
either,
would
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
they
must
have
disagreed
with
what
you
have
just
been
saying,
that
it's
not
very,
really
very
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
which
may
have
political
motivations
besides.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
your
position,
suppose
a
private
individual
who
was
not
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
had
an
arrangement
with
an
independent
contractor
that
the
contractor,
general
contractor
could
not
employ
union
labor
in
building
his
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
text
of,
as
best
you
can
recall
it,
of
8(d)
that
you
rely
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
by
reason
of
preemption.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
in
8(d)
that
says
specifically
that
no
state
shall
require
any
such
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
that
it
says
no
employer
shall
be
compelled
to
do
so,
and
then
h.k.
porter
says
that
means--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
shall
not
be
compelled
by
the
government
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
he
asserts
that
what
has
been
done
here
violates
not
just
(e)
and
(f),
but
(d)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
doesn't
hinge,
doesn't
necessarily
hinge
upon
the
term
employer,
does
it?
