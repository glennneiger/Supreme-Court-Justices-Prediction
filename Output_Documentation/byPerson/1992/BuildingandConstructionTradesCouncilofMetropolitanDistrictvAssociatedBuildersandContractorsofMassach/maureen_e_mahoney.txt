ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
the,
some
of
the
specific
issues
that
were
raised
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
united
states
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
are
here
because
we
firmly
believe
that
the
action
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
did
not
in
any
way
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
policy,
and
in
fact
the
injunction
that
has
been
entered
by
the
first
circuit
really
seriously
interferes
with
very
important
policies
under
that
act.
and
those
are
really
two.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
it
doesn't
have
any
direct
bearing.
you're
referring
to
the
executive
order
that
the
president
signed.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
certainly
can.
i'll
address
it
right
now
if
you'd
prefer.
the
reason
that
the
order
does
not
have
any
direct
bearing
on
the
case
is
that
what
the
president
decided
was
that
for
the
purchases
of
federal
construction
projects,
the
purchase
of
construction
services
with
federal
money,
that
project
labor
agreements
would
not
be
entered
into
in
order
to
further
what
the
president
viewed
as
efficient
contracting.
it
did
not--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
the
reason,
your
honor,
that
i
don't
think
it
does
is
that
the
point
here
is
that
congress
left
it
to
the
states
to
decide
when
they
use
their
money,
when
they
are
the
purchaser,
how
they
want
to
order
their
labor
relations
on
these
projects.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
has
federal
funds
that
would
not
be
affected
by
the
president's
order--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because
there's
no
retroactivity
involved.
it
was
specifically
written
in
a
way--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the
way
that
it
works
is
that
the
grants
that
have
already
been
issued
can
be
applied
to
contracts
that
have
already
been
entered
into--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
there
is
another
round
of
appropriations--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
there
is
no--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--there
is,
there's
only
one,
the
appropriations
are
done
1
year
at
a
time,
there
is
no
commitment
to
do
future
funding
for
this
project.
there
are
still
some
'93,
fy
'93--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because
the
funds
can
be
applied
to
existing
contracts
and
the
state
of
massachusetts
has
a
number
of
existing
contracts
and
they
are
not
affected
by
this
order.
so
both
the
massachusetts
water
authority
and
the
epa
are
of
the
view
that
this--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--in
fact
would
not
impact
this
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
law
it
really
isn't
relevant
to
the
nlra
issue
because
the
president
was
acting
pursuant
to
his
procurement
authority
and
isn't
constrained
in
the
exercise
of
that.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
not
in
any
sense,
and
it
doesn't
really
have
any
direct
bearing
on
it
whatsoever
other
than
to
just
show
that
purchasers
of
construction
services
have
the
option
to
decide
how
they
want
to
order
labor
relations
on
construction
projects.
i'd
like
to
speak
first
to
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
something
that
congress
would
have
intended
the
state
to
enter
into.
in
this
preemption
case
we
have
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
look
at
the
interests
that
are
at
stake
here
and
see
that
congress
has
in
8(e)
and
8(f)
balanced
these
very
same
interests
and
concluded
that
the
interests
of
the
purchaser
in
achieving
labor
peace
on
a
construction
project
throughout
the
duration
of
that
project
are
to
be
given
priority
over
the
interests
of
suppliers
who
prefer
to
do
business
with
a
non-union
work
force.
we
don't
in
any
way
suggest
that
those,
that
the
interests
of
employees
and
suppliers
to
work
on
a
non-union
basis
are
not
important,
they
are,
but
congress
weighed
those
interests,
those
interests
of
doing
business
in
that
form
against
the
interests
of
achieving
labor
stability,
and
it
included
that
suppliers,
that
the
supplier's
interests
had
to
be
subordinated
to
the
preferences
of
the
purchaser.
so
here
in
this
case
we
have
precisely
the
analogous
situation.
we
have
the
state
as
the
purchaser
of
construction
services
having
concluded
in
response
to
economic
forces
that
it
needed
a
project
labor
agreement.
and
there
is
a
factual
finding
in
this
case,
unlike
the
line
drawing
that
might
occur
in
some
future
cases,
in
this
case
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
the
purpose
of
this
agreement
was
to
obtain
labor
stability
due
to
the
fact
that
the
unions
have
legitimate
market
power
in
the
massachusetts
area,
and
that
in
order
to
get
labor
peace
it
needed
to
use
this
arrangement.
there
was--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
could,
as
long
as
it
is
acting
reasonably
in
furtherance
of
its
commercial
interest,
and
that
really
ought
to
be
the
inquiry.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think
that
we
wouldn't
inquire
to
see
whether
there
was
some
view
about
labor
policy,
certainly
many
political
actors
have
views
about
labor
policy,
but
if
the
decision
is
one
that
can
reasonably
be
described
as
something
that
would
appear
to
be
in
furtherance
of
their
commercial
interest,
and
the
policy
you
describe
certainly
could
be.
then
it
would
be
fair
to
conclude
that
that's
the
type
of
conduct,
the
same
kind
of
commercial
activity
that
congress
intended
to
permit.
and
there
really
is
no
good
reason
to
distinguish
between
the
state
and
the
private
purchaser
in
this
situation,
because
as
this
court
recognized
in
abood
the
interests
in
labor
stability
are
no
less
in
the
public
sector
than
they
are
in
the
private
sector,
precisely
the
very
interests
that
this
court
found
in
woelke
and
romero
and
mcneff.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
you
mean
its
interest
in
having
a,
peace
on
that
project?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
and
that's
the
interest
that
congress
said
could
in
fact
be
brought
to
bear,
that
they
could
insist
that
the
suppliers
adhere
to
a
union
agreement,
or
union
recognition
for
that
project.
i'd
also
like
to
emphasize
what
the
effect
is
on
the
non-union
contractors.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
on
this
particular,
in
this
arrangement?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
effect
is
really
that,
is
to
have
labor
stability
on
this
project.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'm
sure
they
would
prefer--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
that
that's
what
this
policy
was
attempting
to
further,
and
certainly
the
district
court
didn't
make
a
finding
that
suggested
that
it
was
and
no
one
has
indicated,
to
my
knowledge,
that
that
was
in
fact
a
motivation.
this
case--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
that
would
be
fine.
under
the
board's
precedents
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
that
this
case
is
even
easier
because
it
is
implementing
the
agreement
of
private
parties.
so
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
concern
that
the
state
shouldn't
be
an
actor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
we
would.
as
long
as
the
state
is
acting
in
furtherance
of
reasonable
commercial
interest
there
simply
is
not
a
good
reason
to
infer
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
this.
and
related
to
this,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
seriously
misunderstood
the
purpose
of
the
machinists
doctrine.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
but
the,
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
binding
on
the
suppliers
who
are
coming
in
is
if
it's
a
term
of
the
agreement
between
the
state
or
between
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
kaiser
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
enforcing
that.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
because
kaiser
is
not
going
to
be
the
contracting
party
with
the
suppliers.
under
massachusetts
procurement
law
the
state
has
to
actually
enter
into
the
arrangements
with
the
suppliers,
so
kaiser
really
wouldn't
have
the
ability
to
make
those
suppliers
adhere
to
that
requirement.
it's
really
because
of
the
requirements
of
the
massachusetts
procurement
law
that
it
has
to
be
done
this
way,
and
the
effect
of
the
first
circuit
decision
is
that
in
massachusetts
you
could
not
have
enforceable
project
labor
agreements,
or
with
any
teeth.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
oh,
they
certainly
could,
they
could
picket,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
way
that
the
court
has--
thank
you
very
much.
