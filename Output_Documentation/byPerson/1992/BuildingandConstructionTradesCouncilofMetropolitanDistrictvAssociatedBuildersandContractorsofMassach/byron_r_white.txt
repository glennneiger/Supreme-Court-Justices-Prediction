justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
point
i
suppose
the
authority
was
bound
by
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
i
know,
but
they,
i
suppose
kaiser
was
its
agent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
bound?
why
wouldn't
the
authority
be
bound
if
they
approved
in
advance
the
negotiation
of
this
contract
and
kaiser
had
been
hired
as
its,
for
the
purpose
of
managing
labor
relations,
among
other
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
arguably
the
argument
had
some
content.
didn't
the
labor
board
have
a
chance
to
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
this
very
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
their
justification
for
the
garmon
preemption
has
already
been
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
by
any
chance,
isn't
there
a
presidential
order
that
has
some
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
speak
about
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
project
doesn't
have
any
federal
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
all
the
subcontracts
have
already
been
made
in
this
case?
i
can't
imagine
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
the
federal
money,
all
the
federal
money
that
was
going
to,
that
this
project
was
going
to
take
has
already
been
appropriated?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
the
government
has
agreed
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
committed
itself
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
why
wouldn't
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event
the
order
certainly
doesn't
eliminate
the
issue
we
have
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
--could
i
ask
you,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
we
uphold
or
strike
down
13.1,
because
that
wouldn't
necessarily
invalidate
the
contract
between
kaiser
and
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
contract
says
all
contractors
are
going
to
be
bound
by
the
labor
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
the
union
could
enforce
it
against,
they
could
picket
everything
in
sight.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
that
the
negotiation
of
the
contract
between
kaiser
and
the
unions
was
also
preempted
since
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
never
argued
garmon
preemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
going
both
tracks?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
stabilization
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
more
than
a
discussion
if
it's
an
agreement,
so
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--tell
me
what
the
agreement
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
between
whom
and
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that's
what
they
really
want
to
stabilize,
isn't
it?
wages.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
stabilize
wages
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
subcontractor
for
example
agrees
that
we
will
pay
no
more
wages
than
x,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
despite
a
demand
by
the
union
to
negotiate
otherwise?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
even
if
this
agreement
didn't
call
for
membership
in
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
does
the
fact
that
the
state
isn't
included
as
an
employer
under
8(e),
why
does
it
follow
from
that
that
there
is
preemption?
i
thought
the
predicate
for
preemption
was
that,
at
least
one
of
the
predicates,
a
machinists
preemption
is
that
the
government,
the
congress
has
decided
that
this
whole
area
should
be
unregulated.
justice
byron
r.
white
--usually
though
it's,
the
federals
keep
their
hands
off
as
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--under
machinists.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't.
they
regulate
this
whole
area
by
8(e)
and
8(f).
justice
byron
r.
white
have
we
ever,
do
you
think
we
have
held
before
that
machinists
preemption,
it's
sort
of
like
sovereign
immunity?
you
have
to,
the
government
intends
to
regulate
only
where
it
says
so,
and
otherwise
the
state
may
not
copy
what
the
government
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
8(e)
and
8(f)
say
that,
certainly
it
doesn't
say
that
there
is
a
free
zone
around
collective
bargaining.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
congress
did
not
create
a
free
zone
for
collective
bargaining
in
the
construction
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
notice
that
the
definition
of
employer
excludes
a
labor
organization,
but
then
it
says
except
when
acting
as
an
employer.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
the
state
here
is
just
acting
in
its
proprietary
capacity.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
in
effect
hiring
people,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
