trades
council
v.

of

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fried,
how
do
you
distinguish
our
ruling
in
the
golden
state
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that
distinction
is
the
proper
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
fried.
ms.
mahoney,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
baskin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
will
we
find
8(d)
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
where
will
i
find
8(d)
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
will
i
find
8(d),
the
text?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
omitted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
8(d)
you
would
have
set
it
forth
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
8(e)
uses
the
term
employer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
say
private
employer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
an
employer
as
defined
in
2(2)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baskin.
mr.
fried,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what's
your
answer,
mr.
fried,
to
his
argument
that
8(e)
and
8(f)
speak
in
terms
of
employer,
but
2(2)
defines
an
employer
as
to
exclude
the
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fried.
the
case
is
submitted.
