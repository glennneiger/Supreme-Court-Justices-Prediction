mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
implied
preemption.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
public
owner
developing
its
property
may
not
support
a
agreement
between
its
construction
manager
and
a
council
of
local
unions,
an
agreement
of
the
sort
specifically
authorized
by
sections
8(e)
and
8(f)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
massachusetts
water
resources
authority,
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
is
under
federal
court
order
to
complete
a
massive
and
complicated
construction
project.
the
authority,
as
any
public
or
private
owner
with
a
similar
task,
has
engaged
the
services
of
a
construction
industry
specialist,
here
kaiser
engineering,
another
of
the
petitioners,
to
schedule
and
plan
the
tasks
to
be
performed,
to
supervise
the
contractors
performing
those
tasks,
and
to
establish
a
labor
relations
regime
for
the
project.
accordingly,
kaiser
did
propose
to
the
authority
that
the
labor
relations
regime
here
should
be
one
which
is
quite
common
on
such
projects,
a
project
labor
agreement,
which
is
an
agreement
with
all
of
the
unions
that
usually
supply
crafts
to
such
a
project
in
return
for
exclusive
representational
rights
for
all
workers
on
the
projects
irrespective
of
their
contracting
and
subcontracting
relations.
the
contractors
and
eventually
the
owner
of
the
project
get
the
benefit
of
stable
costs,
stable
labor
costs
throughout
the
life
of
the
project,
and
security
against
the
kinds
of
labor
disruptions
that
are
caused
by
lawful
labor
activity.
kaiser
proposed
such
an
arrangement
to
the
authority,
which
approved
the
proposal,
and
accordingly
kaiser
negotiated
and
signed
the
agreement
with
the
unions
here.
mr.
charles
fried
the
authority
was
not
a
signatory
to
the
contract.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
a
great
point
is
made
of
that.
nowhere
is
that
said.
on
some
copies
of
the
cover
of
the
agreement,
and
that
is
reprinted
in
one
of
the
appendices,
it
said
that
this
was
done
on
behalf
of
the
authority,
and
that
of
course
is
quite
true.
the
authority
is
the
ultimate
party
that
stands
to
benefit
from
this.
however,
it
is
nowhere
stated
that
kaiser
is
an
agent,
nor
is
kaiser,
i'm
sorry,
that
the
authority
is
an
agent,
nor
is
the
authority
a
signatory.
in
these
connections
of
course
these
contracts
are
read
in
such
a
way
as
to
assure
their
validity,
and
kaiser
is
a
sophisticated
and
a
frequent
player
in
this
particular
arena
and
of
course
it
had
every
intention
to
be
bound.
it
is
not
at
all
clear
whether
the
authority
would
have
been
bound
by
virtue
of
the
contract
itself,
by
virtue
of
that
project
labor
agreement
itself.
it
is
quite
clear
that
kaiser
is
bound,
it
is
quite
clear
that
kaiser
is
a
signatory.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
perhaps
it
would
have
been
bound,
and
if
it
would
be
bound
it
might
be
subject
to
suit
under
section
301
to
enforce
that
contract,
but
that
would
not
in
any
way
affect
its
validity.
now,
in
order
to
make
the
arrangement
an
effective
one
because
of
massachusetts'
competitive
bidding
laws
the
authority
included
adherence
to
the
arrangement
as
a
bid
specification.
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
another
proceeding,
the
district
court
in
this
proceeding,
as
well
as
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
all
agreed
that
this
was
a
valid
labor
agreement
under
sections
8(e)
and
8(f).
the
court
of
appeals
found,
however,
that
the
specific
action
of
the
authority
in
including
adherence
to
the
arrangement
as
a
bid
specification
improperly
intervened
in
labor
relations,
and
therefore
that
that
action
was
preempted.
mr.
charles
fried
in
our
view
it
ought
to
turn
on
it.
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
it
does
not,
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
serious
mistake.
the
doctrine
of
implied
preemption
in
general
gives
a
court
of,
gives
a
court
the
authority
to
intervene
in
and
to
invalidate
the
action
of
the
state
only
if
what
the
state
has
done
in
some
way
contradicts
a
policy
of
federal
legislation.
but
the
policy
of
federal
legislation
here
is
to
leave
the
choice
of
a
project
labor
agreement
open
as
an
option,
so
that
what
the
authority
did
here
was
not
in
any
way
to
contradict
that
policy
but
in
fact
to
utilize
it.
now,
under
the
machinists
doctrine,
which
is
the
specific
head
of
labor
preemption
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied,
the
rule
often
repeated
by
this
court
is
that
a
state
may
not
seek
to
regulate
that
which
the
labor
laws
indicate
must
remain
free
for
the
play
of
labor
market
forces.
but
if
a
state
is
not
to
supply
all
of
its
needs
directly,
if
it
is
to
enter
the
market
as
a
purchaser,
then
it
is
inevitable
that
some
line,
such
as
the
line
between
the
state
as
a
participant
in
the
market
and
the
state
as
a
regulator,
be
drawn.
mr.
charles
fried
this
court
so
held
in
the
gould
case.
mr.
charles
fried
and
the
test
is
a
test
which
i
will
draw
from
what
this
court
said
in
the
new
york
telephone
case,
what
is
the
scope,
purport,
and
impact
of
what
the
state
has
done.
simply
the
fact
that
it
uses
its
spending
power
is
not
a
sufficient
condition
to
get
it
out
from
under
labor
preemption,
of
course
not.
but
in
this
case
the
scope,
purport,
and
impact
of
what
the
state
did
was
precisely
tailored
to
its
needs
as
a
proprietor.
it
did
nothing
that
a
private
party
faced
with
the
same
problems
would
not
have
done.
it's
very
striking
how
narrowly
tailored
the
project
labor
agreement
in
this
case
is
to
the
specific
needs
of
this
project.
these
agreements
often
require
all
contractors
coming
on
the
job
to
be
union
signatory
generally
in
all
their
work
for
the
life
of
the
agreement.
this
agreement
does
not
require
that.
this
agreement
only
requires
that
the
contractors
accept
union
representation
on
this
job.
that
is
how
narrowly
tailored
the
authority's
action
is
to
serve
its
narrow
proprietary
interests.
another
way
of
putting
it--
mr.
charles
fried
--on
an
appropriate
record
with
appropriate
findings
that
might
be
valid,
yes,
your
honor.
i
could
not
say
in
a
blanket
way
that
under
no
circumstances
would
such
a,
would
such
a
labor
policy
be
invalid.
but
there
is
a
great
difficulty.
the
difficulty
is
to
show
that
something
that
is
that
comprehensive,
that
reaches
beyond
the
needs
of
a
particular
project
nevertheless
serves
proprietary
interests.
i
would
not
want
to
say
a
priori
that
that
showing
could
never
be
made.
but
that
showing
need
not
be
made
here
because
of
the
very
narrowness
of
what
the
state
did.
mr.
charles
fried
the
motive
inquiry
is
absolutely
unnecessary
to
such
a
thing.
what's
necessary
is
the
purport
of
the
action
on
its
face,
and
its
impact
and
its
scope
as
it
deals
with
those
conditions
revealed
in
the
record.
the
perfect
contrast
is
with
the
gould
case.
in
the
gould
case
the
state
was
using
its
spending
power,
it
was
talking
about
how
it
would
make
purchases,
but
it
is
simply
implausible,
as
this
court
said,
to
connect
up
what
the
state
did
with
any
proprietary
concerns
that
the
state
might
have
had.
and
that's
the
sort
of
inquiry
which
should
be
had,
and
it's
an
entirely
familiar
inquiry
for
this
court.
it
engages
in
it
in
all
sorts
of
contexts
without
getting
tangled
up
into
inquiries
into
subjective
motivation.
just
last
term
in
the
context
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
the
court
distinguished
between
a
foreign
government
acting
as
a
regulator
for
the
market
on
one
hand
or
acting
as
a,
in
the
court's
words,
a
player
in
the
market.
now
what
we're
saying
is
here
the
authority
was
clearly
acting
as
a
player
in
the
market.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
a,
that
is
an
easier
distinction
to
make
because
in
the
golden
state
case
the
state
had
no
proprietary
interests
in
play
at
all.
it
was
not
a
proprietor
of
any
of
the
parties
involved
or
any
of
the
interests
or
any
of
the
properties
involved.
so
the
golden
state
case,
of
which
a
great
deal
is
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
seems
to
us
to
be
really
quite
irrelevant.
mr.
charles
fried
between
the
state
as
a
market
rate?
mr.
charles
fried
well,
we
believe
it
is,
and
we
certainly
rely
on
it,
and
i
would
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
there
is
no
such
distinction
then
the
machinists
doctrine
cuts
in
a
most
unpredictable
and
i
would
think
devastating
way
into
the
room
for
maneuver
of
a
state
when
it
is
not
supplying
its
own
needs
but
is
acting
as
a
purchaser,
supplies
its
needs
by
purchasing
them
on
the
market.
so
i
think
some
such
distinction
is
absolutely
necessary.
there
is
talk
in
the
court
of
appeals,
rather
glancing
talk,
and
in
the
respondents'
brief
and
in
some
of
their
amici
brief
to
another
head
of
preemption,
garmon
preemption.
now,
garmon
preemption
deals
principally
with
situations
where
a
state
seeks
to
either
supplement
or
contradict
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
needless
to
say,
nothing
of
that
sort
is
present
in
this
case.
it
is
also,
obtains
as
a
form
of
preemption
where
the
state
seeks
to
limit
rights
granted
under
section
7
of
the
act,
and
in
paragraph
34
of
their
complaint
the
respondents,
plaintiffs
did
claim
that
the
rights
of
workers
to
be
represented
or
not
to
be
represented
by
unions
of
their
choice
were
in
some
way
interfered
with
by
the
state's
action.
but
that
argument
viciously
begs
the
question
since
those
section
7
rights
are
explicitly
qualified
by
the
rights
of
section
8(e)
and
8(f).
if
8(e)
and
8(f)
apply,
the
workers
simply
do
not
have
the
full
range
of
section
7
rights.
so
i
think
garmon
preemption
is
really
not
in
play
here,
and
it's
understandable
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rely
on
it.
mr.
charles
fried
yes,
there
was
a
proceeding
brought
before
the
labor
board,
and
that's
something
that
must
not
be
forgotten,
that
the
labor
board
has
held
that
this
is
a
valid
agreement
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
fried
this
very
agreement.
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
quite
clearly
said
yes,
we
do
not
quarrel
with
that
assumption.
mr.
charles
fried
i
would
have
thought
it
is
taken
right
off
the
boards,
justice
white.
now,
there
is
a
further
suggestion
that
is
made
and
it's
a
suggestion
that
seeks
to
meet
my
argument
about
the
hamstringing
of
the
state,
and
that
is
that
what
could
be
done
is
the
state
might
simply
have
hired
kaiser
as
a
general
contractor.
but
that
would
require
that
this
state
and
many
other
states
for
no
reason
should
repeal
their
competitive
bidding
laws
so
that
they
did
not
have
to
let
these
contracts
directly.
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
charles
fried
--but
at
that
point
the
formalism
that
would
be
evoked
would
be
a
formalism
without
any
of
the
advantages
of
formality
because
the
question
would
reappear
then
in
the
form
may
the
state
either
require
that
the
general
contractor
enter
this
kind
of
an
agreement,
suggest
it,
when
the
contractor
suggests
it
approve
it,
and
you
would
get
all
those
questions
all
over
again.
so
it
would
be
a
very
intrusive
intrusion
into
the
way
states
do
their
business
on
one
hand,
and
it
wouldn't
get
you
anything
on
the
other.
you'd
be
left
with
the
same
problems
all
over
again,
just
at
a
slightly
different
stage
and
a
slightly
different
form.
mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
didn't
exaggerate.
mr.
baskin
has
said
so.
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
position
for
which
we
argue
does
mean
that
states
developing
their
property,
alone
among
developers
of
property,
are
unable
to
choose
project
labor
agreements.
that
is
his
clear
position.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
8(e)
and
8(f)
impose
prohibitions
and
then
lift
those
prohibitions
in
respect
to
the
construction
industry.
the
prohibitions
which
are
imposed
speak
of
employers.
therefore
mr.
baskin's
argument
that
states
are
not
employers
really
is
an
argument
that
says
that
the
very
prohibitions
which
are
lifted
by
the
construction
industry
provisos
also
do
not
apply.
the
point
of
the
definition
of
employer
to
exclude
states
is
to
leave
state
labor
relations
greater
scope,
not
lesser
scope.
so
i
think
that
the
argument
on
the
basis
of
section
2
really
moves
in
entirely
the
opposite
direction
as
to
the
state
law--
mr.
charles
fried
--well--
mr.
charles
fried
--8(d)
does,
i
will
admit,
rather
surprise
me,
its
entry
into
the
case.
but
8(d)
had
to
do
with
the
nlrb
seeking
to
impose
a
term
between
two
contesting
parties.
but
of
course
the
authority
here
is
not
imposing
a
term
between
two
contesting
parties,
it
is
a
purchaser.
the
government,
indeed
the
federal
government,
that's
why
we
have
this
executive
order,
the
federal
government
also
purchases
construction
services,
and
in
the
course
of
so
doing
terms
are,
quotes
imposed.
and
that
surely
doesn't
violate
h.k.
porter.
i
think
h.k.
porter
is
entirely
in
apposite
here.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
i
think
that
refers
to
the
situation
where
a,
where
a
labor
organization--
mr.
charles
fried
--thank
you
so
much.
that
is
one
of
the
funnier
pieces
of
the
act,
and
it
relates
to
a
situation
where
the,
for
instance
where
the
labor
organization
hires
people
to
perform
clerical
services
or
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
charles
fried
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
no,
it,
it's
hiring
kaiser.
mr.
charles
fried
and
it's
hiring
the
contractors.
it
is
not
hiring
any
laborers
on
the
project.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
