justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
adopt
the
opposite
policy
and
forbid
the
use
of
these
union
hire,
pre-hire
agreements
by
any
of
its
contractors
for
these
projects?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
does
that
import
some
sort
of
reasonable
judgment
as
to
economic
conditions
without
reference
to
its
judgment
as
to
labor
policy,
sound
labor
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
interests
all
transcend
labor
stability
in
a
particular
job.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
those
interests
always
transcend
the
state's
interest
in
labor
stability
for
a
particular
project.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
effect
goes
beyond
the
project.
the
effect
goes
to
labor
stability
in
the
community
at
large,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
has
no
interest
one
way
or
the
other
in
labor
stability
or
instability
in
the
community--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
its
entire
economic
community?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
believe
it
was
in
the
petitioners'
brief
the
facts
of
golden
state
were
recast
so
that
if
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
the
hypothetical
case
were
the
purchaser
of
taxicab
services
and
the
taxicab
company
was
undergoing
a
labor
dispute,
it
was
submitted
that
certainly
the
city
could
take
its
business
elsewhere.
do
you
agree
with
that
conclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
they
said
you're
in
a
labor
dispute
and
therefore
it's
beyond
contradiction
that
you
can't
provide
the
service
that
we
want,
and
we're
taking
our
business
elsewhere.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can't
the
state
base
its
purchasing
decision
on
likelihood
and
probability?
suppose
the
state
makes
the
determination
that
there's
a
very,
very
strong
possibility
of
labor
instability
with
a
particular
contractor.
don't
they
have
the
option
to
stay
away
from
that
particular
contractor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
the
state
makes
the
reasonable
judgment
that
in
all
likelihood
performance
will
be
impaired
by
reason
of
the
contractor's
labor
policies?
is
the
state
then
not
free
to
take
its
business
elsewhere?
