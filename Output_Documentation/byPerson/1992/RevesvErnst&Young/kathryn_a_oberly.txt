ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court's
task
in
this
case
is
just...
is,
obviously,
to
decide
what
congress
meant
when
it
included
the
conduct
requirement
in
section
1962(c),
and
the
court
needs
to
approach
that
task
by
choosing,
from
among
all
the
possible
meanings
that
are
set
forth
in
the
briefs
and
the
arguments,
the
one
that
most
fits
with
a
common
sense,
logical
understanding
of
what
congress
had
in
mind.
our
position
is
that
the
eighth
circuit's
operation
or
management
test
meets
that
requirement.
at
least
we
seem
to
agree
with
the
government,
that
the
place
to
start
here
is
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
but
in
fact,
the
government's
approach
and
the
petitioners'
approach
i
think,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
has
the
tendency
to
completely
read
out
of
the
statute
the
conduct
requirement
altogether
because
it's
very
difficult
for
them
to
articulate
a
distinction
between
participate
in
the
affairs,
which
is
not
what
the
statute
says,
and
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
enterprise's
affairs,
which
is
what
the
statute
says.
conduct
is
there
for
a
reason.
this
court
has
already
said
in
sedima
that
conduct
is
one
of
the
elements
that
a
rico
plaintiff
has
to
prove.
so,
we're
talking
about
words
of
limitation,
and
they
mean
that
you
can't
prove
a
rico
violation
simply
by
showing--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--not
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
when
he
gives
advice,
which
when
he
gives
advice,
the
company,
the
enterprise,
is
free
to
accept
it
or
reject
it.
the
company
is
still
making
its
business
decisions
about
how
to
conduct--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
he
gives...
if
the
inside
general
counsel...
if
he
or
she
gives
advice
to
management,
again
it's
advice
which
management
can
accept
or
reject.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
management
delegates
to
either
inside
or
outside
general
counsel
the
power
to
make
decisions
and,
for
example,
appoints
the
lawyer
as
agent
to
conduct
the
corporation's
legal
affairs,
then
that
would
be
a
different
question.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
ultimately,
your
honor,
i--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
depends
i
think,
your
honor,
on
whether
that
lawyer
is
given...
if
he
doesn't
have
control
himself,
which
i
don't
think
he
necessarily
has
to
have,
is
he
operating
under
the
control
of
the
ceo
or
someone
who
can
direct
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
then
he's
participating
in
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise,
which
is--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--not
in
the
conduct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
to
me
conduct
imparts
some
notion
which
we
get
from
the
statute,
its
language,
and
its
legislative
history
and
rico's
purpose...
conduct
imparts
some
notion
of
management
or
direction
of
the
affairs.
participate--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
you're
operating
under
their
direction.
if
you
are
just
giving
them
advice,
even
if
it's
advice
about
how
to
commit
an
illegality,
ultimately
the
decision
making
authority
still
resides
with
whoever
it
is
that
is
running,
operating,
or
managing
the
business.
you're
an
outside
advisor.
you
may
be
an
inside
advisor.
i
don't
think
the
outsider-insider
distinction
makes
that
much
difference.
the
question
is
who
is
calling
the
shots,
and
if
you're
doing...
if
you're
acting
for
the
company
with
authority
to
make
those
decisions,
then
you
may
be
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
is.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
is
required
by
law
for
sec
traded
companies,
for
example--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that
you
have
an
accountant's--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--report
every
year,
but
that
conduct
of
the
business'
affairs--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
your
honor,
because
what
the
outside
accountant
is
doing
is
expressing
a
professional
opinion
on
how
the
client
conducted
its
financial
affairs.
the
outside
auditor
is
not
making
business
decisions
for
the
client.
the
outside
auditor
is
not
deciding
whether
to
make
particular
investments.
the
outside
auditor
isn't
deciding
whether
this
co-op
should
advance
initially
$4.1
million
and
later
up
to
$5.8
million--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--to
the
gasohol
plant.
what
the
outside
auditor
is
doing
is
coming
in
and
recording
in
financial
statement
form
decisions
already
made--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--by
the
people
running
the
enterprise.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
your
honor,
what
you're
suggesting
i
think
is
something
akin
to
a
bribery
case
where
the
company
bribes
the
auditor
and
says
we
know
we
have
no
basis
for--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--well,
let's
take
this
case
as
an
example,
your
honor.
that's
the
theory
in
this
case,
that
the
scheme
was
to
keep
the
co-op
afloat
even
though
it
was
insolvent
and
that
arthur
young
was
somehow
instrumental
in
that
scheme.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
i
think--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--your
honor,
with
the
opinions
that
arthur
young
issued
in
this
case,
which
were
qualified
opinions
on
whether
the
co-op
would
ever
be
able
to
recover
the
money
it
had
invested
in
the
gasohol
plant,
which
showed
the
co-op
to
be
losing
$100,000
a
month,
showed
a
6
point...
almost
a
$6
million
advance
to
the
co-op--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--when
an
accountant
acts
as
auditor,
i
would
say
it
is
very
rare
that
he
is
participating
in
the
conduct
of
his
client's
affairs.
i
can
conceive
of
and
will
give
you
situations
in
which
an
accountant
goes
beyond
that,
although
they're
not
this
case.
but
suppose
that
the
accountant
is
not
only
auditing
the
client's
financial
statements,
but
is
sitting
on
the
client's
board
of
directors,
for
example.
he
is
then
conducting
or
participating
with
the
other
directors
in
the
conduct
of
the--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
think
the
auditor
then
clearly
has
committed
the
predicate
acts
of
securities
fraud,
but
is
he
conducting--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--is
he
conducting--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--precisely.
he...
the
predicate
acts
alone
are
not
enough
to
establish
a
rico
violation.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
he
acts
at
the
direction
or
at
the
request
of,
then
i
agree
he's
participating
in
the
conduct,
but
that
isn't--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--well,
your
honor,
then
i'm
perfectly
prepared
to
agree,
that
an
auditor
who
acts
at
the
direction
of
his
client,
as
opposed
to
an
independent
outside
auditor
who
makes
mistakes
who
does
even
terribly
substandard
work,
but
is
still
doing
his
work,
not
the
client's--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
a
request
that
the
auditor
can't
refuse
basically
is--
[laughter]
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it's...
the
way
i
would
characterize
the
test,
the
operation
or
management
test,
is
control
or
under
the
control
of,
and
if
the
president
of
the
company
either
gives
a
directive
to
the
auditors
or
makes
a
"request"
in
a
way
that
the
auditor
can't
exercise
independent
judgment,
then
he
may
well
be
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
client's
affairs.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pardon?
no.
i
think
he--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that...
your
honor,
i
think
you
could
easily
have
what
the
accounting
profession
calls
an
independence
violation,
which
is
a
violation
of
professional
standards
without
necessarily
having
a
rico
violation.
you
can
have
situations
where
the
auditor,
for
whatever
reason,
any
number
of
reasons,
gets
too
close
to
the
situation,
but
is
still
not
conducting
his
client's
affairs.
he
may
be
violating
his
own
professional
standards.
he
may
be
committing
predicate
acts,
but
he's
not
managing
or
operating
the
business.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
as
i
understand
it
this
morning,
virtually
the
entire
theory
here
of
what
arthur
young
supposedly
did
wrong...
we
have
a
concession
i
think
that
normal
auditing
does
not
implicate
rico,
and
this
case
seems
from
petitioners'
point
of
view
to
turn
on
whether
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
by
the
way
is
not
even
a
question
they
presented
to
you
or
on
which
the
court
granted
cert,
they
asked
you
to
decide
the
legal
test.
they
didn't
ask
you
to
apply
it.
i'm
not
saying
the
court
can't
consider
the
facts.
i'm
just
saying
it
suggests
that
perhaps
when
two
lower
courts
have
already
looked
at
these
facts
and
found
no
rico
issue,
that
it
maybe
doesn't
warrant
reexamination
by
this
court.
but
still,
focusing
on
the
creation
of
the
factual...
of
the
financial
statements
is
what
they
say
arthur
young
did
wrong.
what
arthur
young
did
here
was
take
the
client,
the
co-op's
books
and
records,
turn
those
numbers
that
reflected
completed
transactions
that
the
client
had
already
decided
to
engage,
and
to
turn
those
numbers
into
financial
statement
form.
let's
talk
about
the
gasohol
plant
for
a
minute.
this
started
off
as
a
$4.1
million--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
your
honor.
they
were
the
auditors
for
the
firm.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
were
hired.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
were
retained
as
auditors.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
but
auditors--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
a
critical--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that
is
a
critical
distinction.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
a...
and
it
says
to
the
auditor
please
come
in
and
conduct
your
affairs,
which
is
auditing.
we,
the
co-op,
the
client,
have
already
made
decisions
about
our
business
affairs
and
our
financial
affairs,
and
we
want
you
to
come
in
and
look
at
our
books
and
records,
put
them
in
financial
statement
form
for
us,
because
that's
not
something
we're
very
good
at.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
suggestion
here...
the
motive
is
supposed
to
be
keep
a
client
on
whom
arthur
young
is
losing
money
because
we're
having
to
spend
far
more
time
than
our
fees
will
ever
compensate
us
for.
that's
part
of
the
motive.
the
second
part
of
the
motive
suggested
is
help
jack
white.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
this
turned
out
to
be
an
audit
that
took
a
whole
lot
more
time
that...
the
firm,
nevertheless,
went
ahead
and
put
in
the
time
necessary
to
complete
it.
but
the
notion
that
we
were
doing
this
to
keep
a
client
is
at
odds
with
the
facts.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
other--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
don't
think
they
did
it
in
the
sense
you're
talking
about.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
but
the
other
motive
attributed
to
arthur
young
by
the
petitioners
is
that
jack
white,
the
convicted
felon,
prior
general
manager
of
the
co-op,
was
arthur
young's
friend,
that
we
were
trying
to
protect
him,
that
we
were
trying
to
keep...
and
the
ultimate
motive
is
that
we
were
trying
to
keep
our
client,
the
co-op,
appear
solvent
when,
in
fact,
we
knew
it
wasn't
solvent.
if
you
look,
your
honor,
at
again...
at
our
report
which
was
qualified
to
say
that
we
cannot
tell
either
the
board
of
directors
or
any
members
of
the
public,
who
might
want
to
look
at
these
financial
statements,
whether
the
co-op
will
ever
recover
its
investment
in
this
gasohol
plant...
what
we
can
tell
you
is
that
you've
already
sunk
nearly
$6
million
in
it.
you
may
never
see
it
again.
you're
losing
$100,000
a
month
as
you
continue
to
operate
this
plant.
and
frankly,
your
honor,
had
anyone
cared
to
read
those
financial
statements,
they
would
have
known
that
the
co-op
was
hemorrhaging
red
ink
all
over
the
place
based
on
the
report
we
did
issue.
their
complaint
is
we
should
have
said
more.
maybe
we
should
have.
maybe
that's
an
auditing
mistake
that
we
should
have
said
even
more,
but
there's
enough
in
there
to--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
we
were
trying
to
do
that,
we
failed
miserably
at
it.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
your
honor.
but
there's
no
support
for
that
notion.
when
we
issue
a
qualified
opinion--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--let's
change
the
enterprise
for
a
minute
because
there
could
be--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--okay.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
that
doesn't
mean
that
i
think
auditors
are
always
off
the
hook.
i
think
that
it's
very
possible
to
suggest
that
auditors
are,
under
the
situation
you
posed,
conducting
their
own
affairs,
in
other
words,
the
affairs
of
arthur
young--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--when
they
don't
make
the
business
decisions
for
the
client,
when
those
decisions
are
already
made
before
the
auditors
arrive
on
the
scene
and
whether
they're
good
decisions
or
bad
decisions,
fraudulent
decisions
or
not,
the
auditors
come
in.
and
the
most
that
you
can
say
about
the
auditors'
conduct
is
that
it's
substandard,
and
it
may
be
so
substandard
as
to
amount
to
securities
fraud.
that
still
does
not
turn
it
into
conducting
the
client's
affairs.
you
have
to
draw
a
distinction.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
agree
with
you
that
associated
with
is
quite
broad,
and
it
brings
in
outsiders--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
function
of
associated
by.
i
think
the
function
of
associated
by
brings
in
people
who
are
not
employees
of
the
enterprise
that
they
are...
they
may
be
independent
contractors.
they
may
be
lawyers
who
are
outside
the
enterprise.
and
i
think
the
statute
does
apply
to
outsiders
as
well
as
to
insiders.
but
i
think
our
focus
here
today
is
what
did
congress
mean
on
the
one
word
of
limitation
it
put
in
there,
not
the
broad
words,
but
the
word
of
limitation,
which
is
you
have
to
participate
in
the
conduct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
i
think
associated
with,
as
i
said,
would
bring
in
an
outsider
who,
if
you
just
had
employed,
no
matter
what
the
lawyer
or
the
accountant
or
the
outsider
did,
it
wouldn't
be
covered
if
you
just...
if
it
were
just
limited
to
employees.
so,
associated--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
think...
i
agree
with
you.
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
agree
with
you
that
associated
is
broad
enough
and
serves
a
broad
function
of
bringing
into
the
statute's
coverage
people
who
are
not
necessarily
within
the
enterprise.
but
i
think
all
of
those
broad
words
in
the
statutes,
"associated
with",
"participated
indirectly",
all
of
the
broad
words,
are
still
modifiers
of
conduct,
and
our
focus
here
has
to
be
on
what
does
conduct
mean.
and
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
court's
prior
rico
cases
is
you
had
parties
before
you
urging
restrictive
interpretations
of
rico
based
on
language
that
wasn't
there.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
your
honor.
he...
as
you
point
out,
he
can't
do
that.
the
in-house
accountant
who
attempts
to
audit
the
company's
own
financial
statements
is
i
think
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
company's
affairs.
the
outside
advisor--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
would
say
he
is
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
company's
affairs,
but
i
would
say
the
distinction...
and
i'm
not
ever
saying
in
this
argument
that
outsiders
are
automatically
exempt
just
because
they're
outsiders,
but
the
inherent
role
of
the
outside
accountant,
the
outside
auditor,
is
to
come
in
and
conduct
the
auditor's
affairs
expressing
a
professional
opinion
on
how
the
client
conducted
the
client's
financial
affairs.
and
your
internal
accountant
is
conducting
the
client's
internal
financial
affairs.
the
outside
auditor,
on
the
other
hand,
comes
in
several
steps
removed,
looks
at
transactions
the
client
has
already
done,
whether
they're
good
transactions,
bad
transactions
that
happened.
they're
a
done
deal
before
the
auditor
gets
there.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
certainly,
your
honor--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--furthers
the
enterprise
i
don't
think
is
the
test
for
conduct
of
the
enterprise's
affairs.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i...
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
as
the
court
has
noted
over
and
over
again
in
its
rico
opinions,
was
the
infiltration
of
legitimate
businesses
by
organized
crime
or
by
people
committing
patterns
of
racketeering
activity.
when
you're
talking
about
the
outsider
who
is
brought
in
to
express
a
professional
opinion
on
what
the
client
has
already
done
and
who
has
no
power
to
direct
or
control
or
run
those
decisions
by
the
client,
the
danger
of
infiltration
by
the
outsider
is
just
simply
not
there.
now,
that's
not
to
say
all
outsiders
aren't
covered.
the
bribery
cases
that
the
government
discusses
at
length
in
its
brief...
i
agree
outsiders
can
in...
by
paying
a
bribe,
in
effect,
take
over
the
decision
making
authority
of
the
enterprise
by
paying
the
bribe,
and
now
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
making
the
decisions
inside
the
enterprise
aren't.
they're
ceding
their
authority
to
the
outside
briber.
i'm
not
saying
outsiders
are
out
of
the
statute.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
from...
in
this
example
from
the
outsider
to
someone
in
the
enterprise
who
would
normally
be
conducting
its
affairs,
but
who
has
now
effectively
ceded
his
decision
making
authority
to
the
briber.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
it
probably
would,
your
honor,
although
it
might
then
be--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--my
position
would
remain
the
same,
although
it
might
be
that
i
would
look
at
it
as
a
different
enterprise.
i
would
then
look
at
the
accounting
firm
as
the
potential
enterprise.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
because
he
either
controls
the
legal
affairs
of
the
company.
you
said
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
but
he
controls
the
financial
affairs
of
the
company
or
he
operates
under
the
direction
of
the
board
of
directors--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
outside
auditor
has
no
authority
to
come
in
and
tell
the
client
what
to
do.
the
outside
auditor
comes
in
and
makes
recommendations
about
how
the
client's
financial
affairs
look,
how
they
should
be
presented
on
financial
statements,
but
the
client
is
free
to
accept
or
reject
those...
the
advice
of
the
outside
auditor.
the
decisions
cannot
be
made
and
are
not
made
by
the
outside
auditor.
i
know
we
have
a
fact
dispute
here
where
petitioners
contend
that
the
decisions
were
made
by
the
outside
auditors,
but
we've
got--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct,
and
in
that
event
they
would
have
taken
away
from
the
in-house
accountant
the
ability
to
make
decisions
in
the
financial
sphere
of
the
enterprise's
affairs.
in
this
case
the
board
of
directors
actually
affirmatively
adopted
the
financial
statements
that
mr.
elden
makes
the
centerpiece
of
his
argument
about
what
arthur
young
did
that
constituted
conducting
the
co-op's
affairs.
it's
true.
we
drafted
those
financial
statements.
that
is
common
professional
practice
for
auditors,
but
after
drafting
them,
we
sat
down
with
the
board
of
directors
and
met
at
length,
went
over
the
financial
statements
with
the
board,
and
at
the
end
of
that
meeting,
the...
several
meetings,
the
board
members
had
no
further
questions.
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
they
then
voted
to
adopt
those
financial
statements
as
their
own.
what
we
did
was
an
express...
express
an
opinion
on
their
financial
statements,
which
is
conducting
our
affairs,
but
which
is
not
conducting
the
client's
affairs.
i'd
like
to
note
on
the
legislative
history
and
what
is
it
that
congress
had
in
mind
here
on
the
use
of
the
word
"conduct"
that
the...
every
synonym
that
congress
ever
used
for
the
word
"conduct"
in
the
legislative
history
is
operate,
manage,
or
run.
it's...
they're
all
eighth
circuit
synonyms.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
the
conduct
requirement
to
be
something
less
than
operation
or
management,
to
be
just
mere
participation
in
the
affairs,
as
justice
stevens
asked
a
little
while
earlier.
in
the
senate
and
house
report
both,
congress
described
1962(c)
as
prescribing
the
operation
of
a
business
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
i'd
also
like
to
note
that
using
the
eighth
circuit's
operation
or
management
test,
there
has
been
no
explanation
really
from
the
government
about
why
the
catalog
of
rico
cases
that
they
give
us
in
their
brief
would
not
fit...
every
single
one
of
them
would
not
fit...
under
the
eighth
circuit's
operation
or
management
test.
we've
already
talked
about
the
bribers.
whether
they're
insiders
or
outsiders,
i
think
they
definitely
would
be
covered
by
the
eighth
circuit's
test
because
they
are
either
operating
or
managing
the
business
or
operating
under
the
control
of
a
higher-up
who
tells
them
what
to
do.
the
government
is
also
concerned
about
the
low
level
defendants,
although
mr.
dreeben
acknowledges
that
the
justice
department
doesn't
bring
rico
prosecutions
at
some
de
minimis
level,
but
they
have
nevertheless
expressed
concern
about
the
small
fry
as
the
case
is
referred
to
in
criminal
enterprises.
but
there's
no
reason
that
those
defendants
as
well
would
not
be
covered
by
the
eighth
circuit's
operation
or
management
test
because
even
if
they
are
not
themselves
operating
or
managing
or
conducting
because
they're
not
at
the
top
of
the
hierarchy
or
anywhere
near
the
top
of
the
hierarchy,
they
are
operating
under
the
direction
of
the
people
who
do
run
the
enterprise,
and
they
therefore
participate
indirectly
in
the
conduct
of
the
enterprise's
affairs.
and
as
i
said,
the
government
really
has
not
given
us
any
examples
of
rico
prosecutions
that
they
bring
or
that
they
even
want
to
bring
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
eighth
circuit's
operation
or
management
test.
earlier
it
was
questioned
whether
the
rule
of
lenity
ought
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
it's
clear
i
think
to
everybody
that
the
statute
is
not
a
model
of
clarity.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
the
eighth
circuit's
test,
then
i
do
suggest
that
the
rule
of
lenity
is
the
appropriate
way
to
resolve
that
ambiguity
in
favor
of
the
eighth
circuit's
test.
this
case
is
very
similar
to
what
the
court
did
last
term
in
thompson
center
arms,
construing
a
civil
tax
case
that
had
criminal
implications,
couldn't
find
a
way
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
from
either
the
legislative
history
or
the
statutory
language,
and
it
used
the
rule
of
lenity
as
a
tie-breaker.
the
situation
is
the
same
here.
if
the
court
is
unable
to
conclude
from
the
language,
purpose,
legislative
history
of
rico,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
ought
to
still
lead
to
the
same
result
as
the
eighth
circuit
applied
here.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
the
court
addressed
that
in
a
footnote
in
sedima
where
it
said
that
you
can
harmonize
strict
and
liberal
construction
in...
even
within
the
context
of
rico
by
applying
strict
construction
to
sections
1961
and
1962,
which
are
the
statutes...
the
sections
that
have
criminal
applications,
and
liberal
construction
to
section
1964,
which
is
rico's
civil
remedies
provision.
and
this,
of
course,
is
a
case
involving
section
1962.
i
think
if
you--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
the
provision
we're
construing
here
has
both
criminal
and
civil
applications.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
therefore,
the
rule
of
lenity
is
applicable.
where
liberal
construction
would
apply
is,
for
example,
in
sedima
where
you
were
construing
1964
itself,
rico's
civil
remedies
provision.
you
weren't
construing
the
criminal
applications
of
the
same
provision.
here
we're
construing
a
statute
that
has
both
criminal
and
civil
applications
which
calls
for
the
rule
of
lenity.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
at
some
point,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
runs
into
constitutional
problems
of
vagueness
and
due
process
concerns
because
if
you...
if
the
court
is
unable
to--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--give
the
statute
a
construction
that
people
can
understand,
the
potential
criminal
defendants
can
understand,
then
i
don't
think
liberal
construction
can
be
used
to
save
a
construction
that
defendants
don't
know
how
to
conform
their
conduct
to.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
right,
but
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
how
do
you
reconcile
what
congress
put
in
here
about
construing
rico
liberally,
reconcile
it
by...
you
can...
you'll
do
that
as
far
as
you
can,
but
at
some
point
if
you
reach
an
ambiguity
that's
going
to
put
criminal
defendants
in
a
position
of
not
knowing
what
their
conduct
should
be
in
order
to
escape
criminal
prosecution,
then
that
rule
of
liberal
construction
is
going
to
have
to
give
way
to
giving
criminal
defendants
clear
and
understandable
notice
of
how
to
conform
their
conduct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that,
but
i
would
still
think
it's
important.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
think
the
sensible
way
to
interpret
is
limited
to
civil,
but
even
if
you
gave
it
the
broader
interpretation,
then
i
think
the
court
has
to
still
ask
itself
are
we
giving
this
statute
a
construction
that
potential
criminal
defendants
can
understand.
and
we
can't
invoke
liberal
construction
and
remedial
construction
principles
to
come
up
with
an
interpretation
that
potential
defendants
can't
conform
their
conduct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
thank
you,
your
honor.
