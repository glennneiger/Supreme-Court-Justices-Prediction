what
would
be
your
position
if
an
in-house
accountant,
a
full-time
employee
of
the
company,
did
everything
arthur
young
did
here?
now
the
hypothetical
gets
a
little
strange
because
he
has
to
say
i
certify
as
the
company
accountant
that
or
i
advise
you,
but
he
did
no
more.
but
he
was
an...
let's
say
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
company,
but
that's
all
he
did.
same
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
suppose
he
says
as
in-house
accountant
i
have
attempted
an
audit
of
the
company's
affairs,
and
my
results
are
as
follows?
and
he
does
exactly
what
arthur
young
did
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
a
very
real
sense,
the
outside
auditor
lends
more
credence,
more
weight,
to
the
disclosures
and
to
the
statements
than
would
the
in-house
accountant
in
my
hypothetical
example--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and,
therefore,
even...
and,
therefore,
furthers
the
enterprise
in
a
greater
degree.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
relevant
in
deciding
what
conduct
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you
take
the
position
the
in-house
counsel
would
be
liable,
bribe
or
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the
hypothetical
is
all
he
has
done
is
exactly
what
the
accountants
did
here
and
no
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
does
he
do
it
any
more
than
arthur
young
did?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
he
do
it
any
more
than
the
accountants
did?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
in
the
my
hypothetical
the
directors
could
have
rejected
what
the
in-house
accountant
said.
