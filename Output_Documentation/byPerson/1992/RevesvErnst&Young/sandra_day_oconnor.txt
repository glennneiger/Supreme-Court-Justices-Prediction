well,
mr.
elden,
in
interpreting
that
language,
would
you
think
the
night
watchman
might
be
covered
or
the
elevator
operator
or
anybody
who
committed
a
pattern
of
unlawful
acts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
could
be
at
any
level
of
involvement,
and
you'd
say
that's
involved
in
the
conduct
of
the
enterprise's
affairs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
dealing
with
some
pretty
fuzzy
language
here
i
suppose,
and
the
courts
are
all
over
the
lot
in
giving
meaning
to
it.
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
think
that
the
rule
of
lenity
should
apply
in
our
interpretation
of
the
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
where
it
is
fuzzy,
maybe
we
should
err
on
the
side
of
being
careful
before
we
extend
liability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
anyone
would
understand
these
words
just
reading
them.
