justice
david
h.
souter
but
their
friends
stood
to
be
harmed
or
to
be
hurt
when
the
extent
of
their
derelictions
came
out.
is
that
fair
to
say?
so
that
there
was
a
motive
i
guess
is
what
i'm
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
the
accountant
to
do
what
it
did
even
though
it
may
not
have
been
in
a
literal...
jointly
sense...
literally
jointly
participating
at
the
time
it
committed
the
acts
that
you
complained
of.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the
notion
of
participation
require
at
some
kind
of
minimum
level
an
action
with
other
members
of
the
management?
and
at
the
point
that
the
accountants
were
doing
things
dirty,
the
other
members
of
the
management
who
would
have
been
aware
of
this
and
whom
they
might
have
been
acting
with
were
gone.
so
that
weren't
they
in
the
position,
as
you
describe
the
facts,
not
of
acting
with
the
management,
but
of
duping
the
management,
as
well
as
borrowers
and
so
on
for
the
benefit
of
their
friends
who
were
in
jail?
they
weren't
participating;
they
were
deceiving
both
the
management
and
the
buyers
of
the
notes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
also
acting
in
concert
with
the
people
who
have
robbed
the
bank,
and
that
analogy
doesn't
hold
here
because
they're
not
acting
in
concert
with
the
remaining
members
of
the
management.
they
are,
in
fact,
acting
for
the
sake
of
helping
members
of
the
management
who
used
to
be
there,
but
were
gone
by
the
time
they
can...
gone
by
the
time
the
auditors
committed
their
wrongs.
