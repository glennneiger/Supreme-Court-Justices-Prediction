mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
now,
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
rico
statute
requires
that
a
defendant
operate
or
manage
the
business
in
order
to
be
held
liable
under
section
1961(c).
that
holding,
we
submit,
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
departs
from
the
text
of
the
statute
which
does
not
use
the
words
"operate"
or
"manage"
to
describe
the
requirements
for
liability.
second...
and
i
think
this
goes
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity
in
this
case...
the
eighth
circuit's
holding
ignores
that
congress
used
the
words
rico
and
in
other
contemporaneous
laws,
and
i
will
detail
those
laws
in
a
minute.
when
congress
wished
to
impose
the
requirements
of
operation
or
management
for
liability,
it
did
so
explicitly,
not
as
the
eighth
circuit
did
through
the
back
door
by
a
gloss
on
words
that
do
not
contain
that
sense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
first,
justice
scalia,
the
statute
covers
two
different
ways
of
engaging
the
enterprise
in
this
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
first,
it
covers
people
who
conduct
the
enterprise's
affairs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
second,
it
covers
people
who
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs.
if,
by
hypothesis,
the
accounting
firm
had
become,
in
effect,
the
chief
financial
officer
for
the
company
and
was
given
by
the
board
the
authority
to
create
its
financial
statements,
which
in
effect
happened
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
one
within
the
company
to
do
that,
the
accounting
firm
can
be
said
to
have
conducted
this
limited
aspect
of
the
company's
affairs.
even
if
you
turn
to
the
second
aspect
of
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
conducted,
in
essence,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
focusing
now
on
their
creation
of
the
financial
statements
of
the
company
in
which
they
made
fundamental
accounting
decisions
about
the
valuation
of
assets
and
then
gave
those
to
the
company.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
financial
statements
were
integral
to
the
money-raising
functions
that
the
co-op
was
carrying
out,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
the
co-op's
affairs
to
present
its
financial
data.
there's...
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
construction
of
the
concept
of
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise.
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
not
only
in
this
case,
but
in
all
other
cases
that
have
considered
this
issue,
that
part
of
the
affairs
of
a
business
enterprise
consists
of
fairly
presenting
its
financial
data
to
people
who
rely
on
it,
which
would
include
in
public
companies
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
investors
and
in
this
case
covers
the
farmers
who
invested
in
the
demand
notes.
and
all
of
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
all
companies
which
maintain
accounting
staffs
and
financial
departments
view
it
as
part
of
their
affairs.
this
is
not
a
narrow
term
in
the
rico
statute.
this
is
a
statute
that's
designed
to
cover
comprehensively
enterprise
criminality,
and
the
concept
of
affairs
has
never
been
given
a
narrow
reading.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
i
think
that
is
a
narrower
reading.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i'm
not
sure
that
seniority
in
the
company
is
the
issue.
i
think
what
the
issue
is
is
that
it
has
to
be
some
direct
participation
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs,
and
i
can
give
an
example.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
for
example,
we
have
a
number
of
rico
cases
that
cover
bribery
of
court
officials
to
obtain
official
action.
that
i
believe
is
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise
because
it
induces
official
action.
merely
filing
a
fraudulent
pleading
with
a
court,
a
false
pleading
that
misrepresents
facts,
would
be
participating
in
the
affairs
of
the
court
generally,
but
would
not
be
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs.
similarly,
there
are
cases
in
which
people
have
been
conducting
gambling
enterprises
on
corporate
property,
not
involving
really
the
resources
or
any
of
the
prestige
of
the
company,
but
simply
using
it
as
a
location
for
doing
it.
generally,
that
could
be
viewed
as
participating
in
the
affairs
of
the
company,
but
it's
certainly
not
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
company.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
think
the
analogy
to
this
case
would
be
if
somebody
were
drafting
opinions
for
the
court
fraudulently
and
the
court
was
then
issuing
them.
here
you
have
financial
statements
that
were
prepared
fraudulently
and
issued
by
the
company
with
the
accounting
firm
serving
as
the
creator
and
the
explicator
of
the
fraud.
all--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
the
court
then
adopts
them,
then
you
have
a
different
kind
of
question
i
believe.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
if
you
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
the
court,
for
example,
invited
the
parties
to
prepare
findings
of
fact
and
they
were
done
with
the
knowledge
that
they
would
be
used
as
the
basis
for
the
court's
submissions,
and
they
were
done
fraudulently,
this
would
be
a
different
case.
of
course,
we're
not
talking
here
about
examples
that
are
actually
covered
by
the
rico
statute
unless
you
have
the
requisite
pattern
of
predicate
crimes,
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
we
do
have
a
pattern
of
predicate
mail
fraud
and
securities
fraud
crimes.
the
eighth
circuit's
test
is
wrong
most
fundamentally
because
rico
itself
uses
the
terms
that
the
eighth
circuit
read
into
section
1962(c)
in
other
places.
section
1962(a)
prohibits
operation
of
the
enterprise
with
racketeering
proceeds.
section
1962(b)
prohibits
acquiring
control
over
the
enterprise
through
racketeering
acts.
the
d.c.
circuit
said
that
section
1962(c)
requires
control,
but
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
imposed
that
requirement
on
a
different
section
of
rico,
not
on
this
section.
the
gambling
statute,
18
u.s.c.,
section
1955(a),
applies
to
whoever
conducts,
finances,
manages,
supervises,
directs,
or
owns
an
illegal
gambling
business,
and
that
statute
was
passed
as
another
title
of
the
same
act
of
which
rico
was
a
title.
using
standard
principles
of
statutory
construction,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
congress
intended
the
same
limitation
in
rico
that
it
explicitly
passed
in
another
title
of
the
same
act.
and
2
weeks
after
passing
rico,
congress
enacted
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
which
applies
to
a
position...
a
person
in
the
position
of
organizer,
a
supervisory
position,
or
any
other
position
of
management
in
a
group
engaging
in
narcotics
activities.
and
against
the
background
of
those
statutes,
section
1962(c)
must
be
read
as
congress
wrote
it,
to
cover
generally
persons
who
participate
through
usurping
the
enterprise's
activities,
corrupting
the
enterprise's
activities,
or
using
the
enterprise's
activities
to
enhance
their
ability
to
commit
criminal
acts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
he's
not
conducting
the
affairs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
may
very
well
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
may
very
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
there's
an
authoritative
element,
justice
scalia.
it
does
speak
to
people
who
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
even
indirectly,
and
although
obviously
the
government
is
not
seeking
to
use
rico
against
ditch
diggers
or
secretaries
or
people
without
some
level
of
involvement
in
the
enterprise
so
that
they
can
inflict
the
sorts
of
harms
that
rico
is
designed
to
cure,
the
statute
as
written
refers
to
people
who
participate
in
carrying
out
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise.
and
if
they
are
able
to
do
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
would
not
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
excludes
anybody--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
a
matter
of
law,
the
statute
doesn't
exclude
them,
no,
but
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
does,
justice
scalia.
thank
you.
