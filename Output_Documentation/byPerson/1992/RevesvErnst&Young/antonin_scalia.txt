justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
in
cooperation
with
any
particular
officer
of
the
company
who
was
doing
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i'd
find
it
easier
to
say
that
they
participated
in
the
conduct
of
the
company's
business
if
they
were
acting
jointly
with
one
of
the
managers
or
directors,
or
at
least
an
employee
of
the
company
who
was
conducting
the
company's
business.
then
i
could
say
they
participated
in
the
conduct.
but
as
you
describe
it,
anybody
that
they
would
have
made
common
cause
with
was
gone,
and
they
were
just
acting
on
their
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
say
they
can
create
the
books
so
long
as
they
don't
then
audit
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
retroactively
taken
out
of
rico
when
somebody
else
later
does
an
audit?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
don't
think
rico
was
intended
to
codify
general
rules
of
accounting
practice,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
indication
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
this
provision
here
in
particular
was
meant
to
prevent
a
company
from
becoming
an
evil
mechanism,
a
company
becoming
a
law-breaking
company
as
an
enterprise.
and
when
you're
not
working
with
someone
in
the
company,
you
continue
to
work
as
an
outside
auditor,
i
don't
see
how
that
comes
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
they
are
working
with
someone
who
is
a
manager
of
the
business
or
an
employee
of
the
business
with
authority
to
conduct
the
business'
affairs.
so,
you
can
say
it
is
the
business
that
is
corrupted.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
misleading
them
isn't
the
same
thing
as
making
common
cause
with
them.
i
mean,
when
you
bribe
one
of
them,
the
two
of
you
make
common
cause
to
conduct
the
business
in
a...
an
evil,
unlawful
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
unlawful.
no
doubt.
but
i
don't
see
why
that
becomes
a
rico
violation
under
this
section
of
rico
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
elden,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
which
i
think
will
highlight
what's
troubling
justice
souter
and
me
as
well.
what
if
the
offense
here
were
selling...
fraudulently
selling
defective
parts
to
a
corporation
which
then
sold
a...
an
instrument
that
incorporated
those
defective
parts
to
the
public.
would
that
be...
which
is
the
conduct
of
the
corporation's
business.
would
that
be
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
corporation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
we
have
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
fraudulently.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
the
accountant
firm
pawned
off
on
the
company
a
fraudulently
defective
financial
statement,
this
person
pawns
off
on
the
company
fraudulently
defective
parts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
that
in
either
case
you
have
an
actual
carrying
on
of
the
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
manage
is
one
thing,
but
to
act
authoritatively
on
behalf
of
the
company
is
something
else,
isn't
it?
couldn't
we
impose
that
minimal
requirement
and
find
that
even
that
requirement
was
not
met
here?
you
don't
have
to
be
top
dog,
but
you
have
to
be
an
agent
who
can
act
authoritatively
on
behalf
of
the
company
in
order
to
conduct
its
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
nobody
here
who
meets
that
qualification,
who
was
participated
with
by
the
accountants.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
aspect
of
the
affairs
did
they
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
participated
in
the
conduct,
but
they
conducted.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
company's
affairs
any
more
than
my
keeping
a
diary
could
seriously
be
considered
my
affairs.
unless
that's
presented
to
someone
with
the
objective
of
raising
money
from
that
person
or
some
other
objective--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
are
no...
there's
no
business
being
conducted.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
now,
who
was
cooperating
with
the
accountant
in
raising
that
money,
in
conducting
that
affair
of
raising
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
presenting
it?
just
generally
presenting
it?
gee,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--raising
money
is
part
of
its
affairs,
but
i
don't
think
developing
and
writing
out
a
financial
statement--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if
you
apply
that
analogy
here,
what
happened
here
is
exactly
what
happened
in
your
court
case;
that
is
to
say,
the
company
itself
was
misled
just
as
the
court
was
misled.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
different
from
presenting
facts
to
the
court
fraudulently
which
the
court
then
adopts.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
successful,
it's
covered
by
rico.
if
it's
unsuccessful,
it's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
a
construction
company...
is
it
your
position
that
a
worker,
the
lowest
paid
worker
who
digs
ditches
for
this
construction
company...
is
he
conducting
the
affairs
of
the
company
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there
is
some
direction
element
to
it,
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--supervisory,
some
authoritative
element
somehow?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
include
ditch
diggers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
secretaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
include
ditch
diggers.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
it
does
include
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
conduct.
it
says
conduct
or
participate
in
the
conduct.
what
if
an
officer
of
the
corporation
comes
to
a
lawyer
and
says,
look
it,
we
want
to
run
this
scam
on
the
public?
i'd
like
your
advice
as
to
how
it
can
be
conducted
in
a
way
that
is
least
likely
to
be
detected
by
the
bank
auditors
or
whoever.
and
the
lawyer
says,
okay,
this
is
how
you
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
he
be
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
controlled
by
him,
but
he's
helping
him.
he's
participating
with
him
in
the
scam.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
see
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
helping
somebody
who
manages,
aren't
you
participating
in
the
management
by
helping
someone
else
who
manages?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if--
--you
said
"or
request"
a
minute
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
"or
request"
a
minute
ago.
just
direction
or
is
it
direction
or
request?
that
was
my--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
oberly,
i
have
trouble
going
along
with
the
notion
that
you
have
to
be
subject
to
the
direction
of
somebody
in
the
corporation
as
opposed
to
merely
acting
pursuant
to
request
by
or
in
cooperation
with.
the
beginning
of
this
provision
is
so
broad.
it
says
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
employed
by
or
associated
with
an
enterprise.
now,
what
time
is
it
up
there?
if
that
language...
if
what
was
intended
is
what
you
suggested,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
not
have
said
something
as
broad
as
"or
associated
with".
they
would
have
just
simply
said
any
person
employed
by
or
directed
by.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
mean
people
who
are
directed,
who
are
subject
to
direction?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
what
they
meant
by
it
was
to
cancel
out
associated
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
strange
to
use
for
someone
who
is
subject
to
direction.
he
is
someone
associated
with
the
enterprise.
you
would
say
employed
by
or
directed
by
or
something
other
than
associated
with.
that's
a
very
loose
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
the
provision
of
the
statute
requiring
a
liberal
construction
trumps
the
rule
of
lenity?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
doesn't,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
different
results
that
the
same
transaction
can
be
a
civil
violation
and
not
a
criminal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
we
should
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
this
provision
instructing
us
not
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
[laughter]
and
if
we
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
that,
we
would
come
out
applying
it
to
the
civil
provisions
and
not
to
the
criminal
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine
when
you're
talking
about
securities
fraud,
but
rico
doesn't
just
apply
to
securities
fraud.
it
applies
to
all
sorts
of
misdoings
by
corporations,
breaking
people's
legs,
a
lot
of
things.
a
ditch
digger
could
be
involved
in
some
of
those
things.
