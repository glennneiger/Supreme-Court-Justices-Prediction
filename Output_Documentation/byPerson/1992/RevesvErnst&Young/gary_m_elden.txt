mr.
gary
m.
elden
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
rico
and,
in
particular,
it
involves
what
does
it
mean
to
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
eighth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
summary
judgment
for
an
accounting
firm
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
farmer's
co-op.
the
only
relevant
fact
the
court
needs
to
know
i
think
about
the
farmer's
co-op
is
that
it
financed
itself
by
selling
demand
notes
to
its
members.
they...
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
proper
test
was
whether
the
accounting
firm
engaged
in
the
operation
or
management
of
the
co-op,
but
to
understand
the
test
i
think
it's
necessary
to
keep
three
facts
in
mind.
there's
an
enormous
number
of
facts.
i'm
just
going
to
stress
three.
i
think
without
it,
it's
not
possible
to
fully
appreciate
how
restricted
the
test
is.
all
courts
agree...
and
i'm
going
to
use
the
language
of
the
courts.
so,
this
is
not
my
version
of
things.
the
courts
who
gave
the
summary
judgment
agreed
that
these
facts
a
jury
could
have
found:
first,
that
arthur
young
"created"
the
financial
statements
of
the
co-op,
not
audited
them...
not
audited
them,
but
created
them.
and
the
district
court
explained
in
detail
what
he
meant.
arthur
young
invented
the
cost
figures.
arthur
young,
according
to
the
district
court,
engaged
in
a
blatant
fiction.
the
records
of
the
co-op
showed
that
a
sale
had
occurred.
a
multi-million
dollar
transaction
had
occurred.
a
self-dealing
transaction
that
rendered
the
co-op
insolvent
was
a
sale.
all
the
records
showed
that:
tax
returns,
minutes,
court
decrees.
they
chose
themselves,
consulting
no
one,
to
ignore
that
fact,
and
numerous
other
points
that
the
district
court
made.
they
created
the
financial
statements,
and
they
created
financial
statements,
basically
on
their
own
without
consulting
very
much
anyone
else,
which
concealed
the
insolvency
of
the
co-op
and
concealed
the
self-dealing
and
even
crimes
of
the
principals.
second,
the
courts
agreed
that
arthur
young
took
the
financial
statements
it
had
created
and
used
those
affirmatively
to
mislead
the
investors
and
the
buyers
of
the
demand
notes.
they
did
this
by
participating...
that's
the
court's
word...
participating
in
the
creation
of
condensed
financial
statements,
which
everybody
admits
were
fraudulent
and
misleading.
even
arthur
young
makes
no
attempt
to
defend
those.
and
they
attended
annual
meetings
where
both
courts,
eighth
circuit
and
the
district
court,
agreed
they
lied
in
response
to
direct
questions.
they
deliberately
concealed
facts
from
the
investors.
the
jury
found...
there
was
not
even
appeal
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
so,
it
has
become
final...
that
they
did
this
with
the
actual
intent
to
mislead
and
deceive
investors.
and
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
everybody
knew
that
if
the
investors
were
not
told
of
the
insolvency,
they'd
continue
to
buy
demand
notes,
and
if
they
were
told,
there
would
have
been
a
run
on
the
co-op.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
principal
wrongdoer
was
already
in
jail
when
this
happened.
there
were
nine
directors,
five
of
whom
remained
in
office
and
who
were
at
least
guilty
of
negligence
if
not
collusion.
there
were
four
reform
directors
who
were
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
things
and
tell
the
truth
to
people.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
i
would
like
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
your
honor
to
agree
with
me,
but
the
truth
is
that
they
basically
did
it...
they
did
95
percent
of
this
themselves.
no
one...
there's
no
proof
anyone
even
knew
what
they
were
doing.
they
pulled
off
the
fraud
to
cover
up
themselves,
to
protect
their
friends
who
were
by
then
gone.
now,
kirit
goradia
did
pull
together
some
of
the
financial
data.
i
mean,
there
was
a
lot
of
financial
data
in
the
financial
statements.
it
wasn't
all
cooked.
some
of
it
was
straight.
kirit
goradia
pulled
that
together.
but
i
think
essentially
the
creation
of
the
false
financial
statements
was
virtually
totally
the
work
of
arthur
young.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
correct.
your
honor,
our
view
that
we
presented
to
the
jury
was
that
the
motive
was
to
cover
up
what
amounted
to
crimes
not
only
by
jack
white
who
was
on
his
way
to
jail
or
in
jail
by
then,
but
the
lawyers
for
jack
white
who
had
suborned
perjury
who
had
put
this
whole
crooked
deal
together
and
could
themselves
been
disbarred
or
who
knows
what.
those
were
the
people.
the
people
who
needed
the
coverup
were
the
people
who
changed
orders
to
arthur
young.
nothing
wrong
with
the
old
auditor.
he
had
done
it
the
right...
he
had
recorded
it
as
not
being
owned
by
the
co-op
the
previous
year.
the
people
who
needed
the
coverup
brought
in
arthur
young
and
they
got
it.
in
terms
of
participation,
if
i
could
address
justice
scalia's
point,
because
i
would
like
to
make
it
easy
for
everyone
to
agree
with
me,
i
think
that
there's
a
lot
of
things
arthur
young
did
not
do.
they
didn't
sell
the
grain.
they
didn't
do
the
lease.
they
didn't
hire
and
fire
employees.
they
participated
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
by
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
creation
of
the
financial
statements.
the
third
fact
which
i'll
allude
to
only
briefly
is
that
everyone
admits
they
used
the
financial--
mr.
gary
m.
elden
--yes.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
no.
in
fact,
i
tried
my
best
not...
that...
arthur
young
tries
to
portray
our
position
as
applying
to
the
typical
auditor.
it
does
not.
this
was
an
extreme
fact
situation.
if
an...
there
are
two
things
an
auditor
can
do
that
are
perfectly
proper.
one
is
it
can
audit
books
prepared
by
others.
if
the
others
created
a
fraud
and
the
auditor
misses
it,
it
may
be
negligence,
but
it's
not
rico.
we
never
contended
it
was
rico.
second
thing,
he
can
go
farther.
he
can
help
them.
he
can
help
them
put
the
books
together.
you
can
out-source
your
accounting
function.
you
can
hire
arthur
young
to
do
all
your
accounting
work.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
once
they've
gone
to
a
certain
point
of
putting
the
books
together,
they
can't
audit
themselves.
if
they
want
a
certified
audit,
they
need
to
bring
someone
new
in.
i'm
in
complete
agreement
that
arthur
young's
statement
of
that
in
their
briefs
is
the
proper
role
of
the
auditor.
arthur
young
went
far
beyond
the
proper
role
of
the
auditor
here.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
by
creating
the
books,
doing
it
fraudulently,
and
then
auditing
themselves,
and
not
catching
themselves.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
i
think
it
is--
mr.
gary
m.
elden
--your
honor,
i'm
not
actually
speaking
of
a
legal
principle
here.
i'm
speaking
of
the
accounting
rules
that
the
accountants
set
for
themselves.
they
allow
themselves,
to
a
small
degree,
to
help
the
client
put
the
books
together
even
though
they
audit.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
no.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
it
plainly
was
not.
it
plainly
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
well,
in
terms
of
whether
outsiders
are
covered,
a
point
which
arthur
young
has
conceded...
so
have
all
the
amicus...
the
proceeding
language
in
section
1962(c)
talks
about
people
employed
by
or
associated
with.
the
classic
rico
case,
numerous
predicate
acts,
concerned
bribers.
bribers
are
normally
outsiders
who
are
influencing
only
some
aspect
of
the
business,
not
controlling
the
whole
business.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
in
that
case,
i
now
have
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question.
sorry
i'm
so
slow.
the
board
of
directors
had
to
adopt
the
report
of
arthur
young,
and
arthur
young
had
to
persuade
them
to
do
that
at
meetings
by
misleading
them
and
not
telling
them
the
entire
truth.
arthur
young
could
not
single-handedly
have
set
up
the
meetings
and
promulgated
a
final
report.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
that's
true
with
bribery,
but
not
with
fraud.
with
fraud,
you
might
be
deceiving
them
into
doing.
if
you're
bribing
them,
you're
persuading
them
to
do
what
you
want
them
to
do.
fraud
you
might
be
deceiving
them
into
doing
what
you
want
them
to
do.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
well,
the...
taking
1962
as
a
whole,
all
three
sections
refer
to
pattern
of
racketeering
acts.
that's
the
prohibited
thing.
if
you
do
the
prohibited
thing
to
invest
in
a
company,
that's
a.
if
you
do
it
to
control
a
company,
that's
b.
but
if...
but
c
covers
merely
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
or
conducting
the
affairs.
even
if
you
conduct
all
the
affairs,
you're
still
covered
under
c.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
no.
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
word
"participate",
which
has
a
half-century
tradition
behind
it
and
which
was
a
word
well-known
to
congress
at
the
time
they
used
it,
plainly
excludes
people
who
are
not
materially
involved
in
furthering
something.
participate
has
been
used
throughout
all
the...
all
50
states.
numerous
federal
statutes
have
participants
as
people
who
materially
aid
or
assist
someone
else
who
could
be
the
primary
wrongdoer
or
could
just
be
equal
with
them
in
accomplishing
something.
so,
a
participant
is
not
someone
who...
just
a
person
who
goes
out
for
coffee
while
they're
committing
the
fraud
is
not
a
participant
under
the
securities
laws.
you
don't
even
get
to
a
predicate
act
that
way.
it's
only
when
you
materially
aid
and
assist.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
i
would
say
not
the
very
lowest
level,
but
not
necessarily
confined
to
the
highest
level.
a
person
who
effects
a
purchasing
decision,
bribes
the
purchasing
agent,
is
covered
even
though
he
doesn't
also
handle
marketing.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
i--
mr.
gary
m.
elden
--your
honor,
the
rule
of
lenity
is
to
some
extent
at
tension
with
the
statutory
command
to
give
liberal
construction.
i
think
the
way
i
reconcile
them
is
if
by
giving
a
liberal
construction
to
certain
words,
a
person
is
able
to
come
to
a
sensible
meaning
of
them,
then
it's
not
ambiguous
and
the
rule
of
lenity...
in
other
words,
using
congress'
guideline
of
liberality,
if
a
person
is
able
to
understand
the
words,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
would
not
apply.
if
it's
still
ambiguous,
it
would.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
i
think
unlike
the
pattern
of
racketeering
concept,
which
is
a
novel
concept
in
rico
and
which
is
very
difficult
to
understand,
these
words
all
have
been
interpreted
by
courts
in
the
same
way
dictionaries
interpret
them,
in
the
same
way
laymen
use
them,
and
they're
used
in
many
other
statutes.
the
concept
of
participating
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
is
used
in
the
firrea
statute
that
was
just
adopted.
a
similar
concept
has
been
used
in
the
securities
laws
with
no
problems,
no
one
claiming
it's
unconstitutional.
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
is
fairly
straightforward
english
prose.
and
i
think
that
rico
as
a
whole
is
a
very
complicated
statute
because
of
the
pattern
of
racketeering
concept,
and
through
the
pattern
to
racketeering
language,
which
fortunately
i
don't
think
is
before
the
court
today...
and
i
agree
that
that
makes
the
entire
sentence
very
complicated.
but
assume
for
the
moment
we
know...
let's
say
it's
stipulated
that
there's
a
pattern
of
racketeering
acts.
once
that's
stipulated,
i
think
the
rest
of
the
sentence
is
not
hard
to
parse
relative
to
other
federal
statutes.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
i
agree
with
the
first
comment
your
honor
made,
that
at
a
certain
very
low
level
of
participation,
i
would
agree
it
is
not
covered,
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
simply
a
preference
or...
i
think
that
is...
in
the
word
"participate",
as
it
has
been
used
for
half
a
century,
but
it
is
sufficient.
it
is
sufficient.
to
drive
the
getaway
car
is
sufficient
even
if
you
drive
the
getaway
car
all
by
yourself
and
you're
the
only
one
who
drives
the
getaway
car.
if
you--
mr.
gary
m.
elden
--your
honor,
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between
conspiracy
and
participate
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs.
other
people
were
also
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs,
the
salesmen,
the
people
who
were
making
the
demand
notes
available,
the
board
of
directors
which
was
continuing
to
run
the
co-op,
calling
the
meetings.
there
was
a
lot
of
things
going
on
at
the
co-op
that
arthur
young
had
nothing
to
do
with,
and
without
the
co-op
being
an
ongoing
enterprise...
it
was
functioning
in
many
other
respects...
arthur
young's
fraud
would
not
have
succeeded.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
i
think...
no.
i
think
a
person
who
merely
is
engaged
in
transactions
with
the
company
is
not
conducting
its
affairs.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
that
person
merely
sells
defective
parts
to
the
company.
that's
all
he
does?
mr.
gary
m.
elden
commits
a
fraud
on
the
company.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
that's
all--
mr.
gary
m.
elden
--as
i
read
the
word
"conduct",
it
requires
some
carrying
on
of
the
actual
business
of
the
company,
not
merely
selling
it
to
them.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
reply
if
i
may.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'm
going
to
limit
myself
to
answering
questions
posed
by
justice
white
and
justice
scalia.
that's
all
i
have
to
add.
justice
white
asked
about
whether
there
was
evidence
of
keeping
it
afloat
by
fraud.
the
point
is
because
of
the
novel
way
this
case
proceeded,
we
have
a
final
jury
verdict
that
they
originated
the
fraud...
that's
right
from
the
jury
instructions...
with
an
actual
intent
to
defraud,
that
they
deliberately
concocted
phony
statements
with
no
actual
belief
in
their
truth.
arthur
young
did
not
appeal
that
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
they
conceded.
motive,
intent,
all
those
things
are
established
conclusively
at
this
point.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
so,
the
question
that
your
honor
put...
ms.
oberly
responded
by
going
into
what
happened
at
the
board
meeting,
all
sorts
of
factual
things.
the
point
is
that
is
all
over.
we
know
that
arthur
young
deliberately
set
out
to
mislead
people
and
created
the
financial
statements
to
do
so.
that
is
taken
as
given
at
this
point
in
the
case.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
it's
not...
it
does
not
necessarily
dispose
of
the
entire
case,
your
honor,
but
i
thought
it
was
responsive
to
your
honor's
question.
if
i'm
wrong,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
the...
it
was
granted
before.
it
was
renewed
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence.
the
judge
agreed
to
reconsider,
and
then
reaffirmed
his
previous
decision.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
frankly,
your
honor,
the
records
are
essentially
the
same,
but
we
have
cited
to
the
trial
record
for
convenience
all
throughout
the
case,
and
we
did
it
again
in
this
brief.
it's
a...
it's
certainly
proper
to
confine
the
court's
attention,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
to
just
the
trial
record.
it's
also
proper
to
consider
just
the
pretrial
record.
they're
essentially
the
same.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
i'd
like
to
answer
justice
scalia's
very
first
question.
should
we
limit
rico's
scope
to
people
who
can
act
authoritatively
on
behalf
of
the
company?
i
think
there's
three
reasons
why
we
can't.
the
predicate
acts,
bribers
and
extortionists
ordinarily
do
not
act
authoritatively
on
the
company.
justice
scalia
in
a
later
question
pointed
out
people
can
merely
be
associated
with
the
company.
they
can
be
outsiders.
that's
conceded.
and
we
have
the
word
rico,
for
a
change,
is
a
word
with
well-settled,
very
precise
meanings,
fully
covered
in
the
securities
laws
and
aiding
and
abetting
law.
and
it
means
it
gets
us
off
the
ditch
digger
problem.
ditch
diggers
aren't
covered
by
the
securities
laws
either.
no
one
has
had
problems
in
a
half
century
of
construing
these
statutes.
very
low
level,
ministerial
people,
file
clerks,
receptionists,
are
not
considered
participants.
they're
not
considered
aider
and
abetters.
a
person
must
do
something,
must
materially
aid,
must
materially
assist,
must
engage
in
some
significant
act,
but
does
not
have
to
be
running
the
show,
does
not
have
to
be
the
primary
wrongdoer,
does
not
have
to
do
everything.
mr.
gary
m.
elden
your
honor,
i'm
focusing
on
the
fact
that
congress
chose
a
word
1970
had
such
a
well-settled
meaning
as
striking
a
middle
road.
thank
you,
your
honor.
