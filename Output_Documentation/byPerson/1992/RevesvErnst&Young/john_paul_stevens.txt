justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
the
position
that
whenever
an
auditing
firm
creates
financial
statements,
that
it
has
engaged
in
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
creating
the
books.
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this
second
category
that
you
described?
do
you
think
the
statute
has
a
different
meaning
when
it
refers
to
conduct
of
such
enterprise's
affairs
through,
so
forth,
than
if
it
simply
said,
participate
in
such
enterprise's
affairs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
require
some
level
of
seniority
in
the
company.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
give
me
an
example.
the
difference
between
participation
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
and,
on
the
other
hand,
participation
in
the
affairs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
mean
he
can't
exercise
his
independent
judgment
without
losing
the
client.
is
that
what
the
test
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
i'm
sure
happens
once
in
a
while.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
any
event,
if
i
understand
your
opponent's
position,
that's
not
this
case
because
the
wrong
here
is
that
the
auditors
acted
too
independently.
they
created
everything,
if
i
understand
their
theory,
rather
than
did
something
at
the
direction
of
somebody
in
management.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
don't...
you
wouldn't
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
congress
could
say
in
a
statute
the
rule
of
lenity
shall
not
apply
to
this
statute
even
though
it's
a
criminal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
then
is
whether
the
general
comment
on
liberal
construction
is
equivalent
to
that
or
is
limited
to
the
civil
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
limited
to
the
provisions
that
are
entirely
civil
in
their
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
question
just...
was
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
granted
before
or
after
the
jury
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
record
that
we
look
at
is
the
entire
record
or
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
original
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
