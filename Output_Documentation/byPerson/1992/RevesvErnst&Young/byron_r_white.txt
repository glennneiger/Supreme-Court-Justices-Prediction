justice
byron
r.
white
does
a
lawyer...
is
the
outside
general
counsel
to
a
concern...
is
it...
whether
that's
an
enterprise
or
not
is
beside
the
point,
but
would
the
lawyer
be
considered
to
be
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
when
he
gives
advice
as
to
whether
this
conduct
is
legal
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
inside
general
counsel
in
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it's...
what
if
a
certificate
of
counsel
were
required
by
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
or
what
if
they...
what
if
a
certified
audit
is
required
by
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
it
the
business
can't
go
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
would
not
qualify
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
may
be
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
the
honest...
it
may
be
so
of
the
honest
auditor.
but
what
if
he's
a
crooked
auditor
and
he
wants
to
further
the
affairs
of
the
business
end.
without
a
crooked,
dishonest
statement,
the
enterprise
can't
go
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
didn't
say
that
at
all.
i
just...
the
auditor
is
actirg
in
its
self-interest.
he
wants
to
keep
a
good
client.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that's
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
it,
the
business
wouldn't
have
been
conducted.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
just
want
to...
i
suppose
you
want
to
win
this
case
on
any
ground
that
you
want
to
win
on,
but
you
want
to
win
it...
you
submit
that
you
want
the
general
rule
that
no
accountant
who
does
no
more
than
jigger
with
a
financial
statement...
no
accountant
is
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you...
and
you
say
even
if
the
president
of
the
company
says,
look,
we're
in
trouble,
can
you
jigger
up
the...
our
financial
statements,
your
certificate,
and
the
auditor
says
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
isn't
what
the
question
is
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
he
acts,
a,
at
the
direction
or
at
the
request
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
my
hypothetical.
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
can't
refuse
without
losing
a
client.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
just
didn't
do
it
on
their
own.
they
were
the
accountants
for
the
firm?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
for...
the
auditors
for
the
firm.
and
they
just
didn't
do
it...
they
just
wouldn't
do
it
for
nothing.
they
must
have
been
hired.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
retained
as
auditors?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
so
they're...
please
do
our
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
please
do
our...
please
audit
our
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
please
audit...
now,
there's
a
request.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
request.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
suppose
the...
i
don't
suppose
arthur
young
did
what
it
did
without
some
kind
of
a
motive.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'll
soon
be
out
of
business
if
that's
the
way
you
do
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
did
they
do
it?
why
did
they
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
it
isn't
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
do
you
think
that
arthur
young
was
attempting
to...
perhaps
attempting
to
keep...
by
its
financial...
by
its
auditing
report
attempting
to
keep
the
company
afloat?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but...
you...
were
they
trying
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
were
trying
to
keep
it
afloat
and
without
it,
without
this
effort,
it
would
have
been
really
a
dead
fish--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
let's
don't
change
the
enterprise.
just
how
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
but
how
about
the...
also
the
affairs
of
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
way
does
the...
in
your...
which
way
does
the
bribe
run
between
the
outsider--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
so,
your
position
would
remain
the
same
if
the
company
actually
paid
a
bribe,
i
mean,
more
than
what
the
auditor
would
usually
charge,
to
falsify
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
would
what?
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that
participating
in
the
conduct
of
the
business?
