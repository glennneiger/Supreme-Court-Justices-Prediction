justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
can
i
ask
about
a
provision
that
i
didn't
even
know
about?
i've
been
listening
to
miranda
cases
and
edwards
cases
and
minnick
cases
for
seven
terms
now.
why
has
the
united
states
never
cited
in
any
of
those
cases
18
u.s.c.
section
3501?
is
there
some
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
that
voluntary
confessions
shall
be
admissible
and
that
voluntariness
shall
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
that
no
single
item,
such
as
whether
the
defendant
was
advised
or
knew
that
he
was
required
to
make
a
statement,
shall
alone
be
determinative.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
certainly
very
relevant
to
this
case,
very
relevant
to
a
lot
of
other
cases.
it
has
never
been
cited
to
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
sort
of
executive
nullification
of
a
congressional
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
repeatedly
or
ever
cited?
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
lasts
forever,
mr.
conte.
[laughter]
