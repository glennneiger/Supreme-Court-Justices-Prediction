chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1521,
united
states
against
lowell
green.
mr.
roberts,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
government
not
rely
on
that
statute
in
any
lower
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
don't...
does
the
government
not
feel
any
duty
to
call
the
statute
to
the
attention
of
lower
courts?
or
to
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
feel
no
obligation
to
call
the
statute
to
the
attention
of
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
we
prefer
to
decide
a
case
on
a
statutory
basis
rather
than
a
constitutional
basis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
conte,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there's
nothing
to
be
gained
by
a
reversal
here,
mr.
conte.
certainly
one
thing
that
would
be
gained
would
be
the
admission
of
more
reliable
evidence
in
a
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you've
certainly
got
a
good
deal
of
assurance
with,
first,
the
miranda
prophylactic
rule
and
then
the
edwards
prophylactic
rule
that
any
coercive
pressure
that
might...
even
if
it
had
existed
at
one
time,
would
have
been
attenuated
by
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
i
suppose
if
he
refuses
to
talk
about
the
offense
itself,
that
would
prevent
him
from
getting
any
points
for
accepting
responsibility
under
the
guidelines.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
he
admits
his--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--can
he
get
any
more
points
off
if
he
talks
about
it
as
well
as
pleads
guilty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet,
at
this
most
vulnerable
time,
when
the
probation
officer
comes
to
him,
you
say
that
the
practice
is
not
to
give
any
renewed
miranda
warning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
conte.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
