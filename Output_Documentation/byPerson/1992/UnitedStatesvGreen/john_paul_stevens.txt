justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
has
been
resolved,
and
there's
a
dramatic
change
in
circumstances,
but
a
moment
ago
you
said
the
government
still
could
not
question
him
after
the
guilty
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
is
still
represented
by
counsel
on
the
drug
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
the
dramatic
change
other
than
the
fact
that
if
you
win
this
case,
there
will
be
a
dramatic
change?
but
what
else
is
dramatically
different
before
and
after
the
guilty
plea?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
terms
of
rights
to
talk
to
people
and
rights
to
have
access
to
counsel,
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
isn't
because
he
hadn't
been
sentenced
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
aren't
matters
relevant
to
the
drug
charge,
even
though
he
has
pleaded
guilty,
still
relevant
to
the
sentencing
decision
that
is
yet
to
be
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
why
they
can't
talk
to
him?
isn't
that
why
the
sixth
amendment
right
still
applies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
see
what's
so
dramatically
different.
that's
what
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
would
justify
questioning
about
the
drug
charge
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position,
mr.
roberts?
your
view
is
that
after
a
man
pleads
guilty,
the
prosecutor's
office
may
call
him
in
and
say
we
don't
want
to
ask
you
about
the
specific
crime
to
which
you've
pleaded
guilty,
but
we
would
like
you
to
tell
about
everything
else
in
your
life
that
might
have
a
bearing
on
your
sentencing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
your
rule
would
allow,
isn't
it?
no,
but
that's
what
your
rule
would
allow,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
have
to
give
miranda
warnings--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
conte,
is
it
the
practice
in
the
probation
interview
to
give
the
defendant's
lawyer
notice
of
when
the
interview
is
going
to
take
place
so
the
lawyer
can
be
present
if
he
wants
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
let
me
put
the
question
a
little
differently.
does
the
defendant
himself
get
advance
notice
or
do
they
just
kind
of
walk
in
on
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
walk
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
probation
officer
is
a
court
official?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
mr.
roberts,
involving
admissions
of
statements
made
to
the
probation
officers
that
inculpate
the
defendant
in
other
crimes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
counsel
correct
that
the
probation
officer
does
not
routinely
give
miranda
warnings
when
other
crimes
are
to
be
discussed?
