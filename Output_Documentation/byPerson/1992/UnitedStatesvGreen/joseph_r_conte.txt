mr.
joseph
r.
conte
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
green
was
incarcerated.
at
4:00
in
the
morning,
he's
taken
from
his
bed.
at
6:00
in
the
morning,
he
arrives
at
the
district
of
columbia
courthouse.
he's
feet
away
from
the
courtroom.
he's
feet
away
from
the
criminal
justice
act,
but
he
sits
for
another
4
hours
and
17
minutes,
at
which
time
he
is
taken
from
the
district
of
columbia
courthouse
to
the
homicide
branch
one
block
away.
he
sits
another
2
hours
before
he's
advised
of
his
miranda
rights.
we
believe
that
this
case...
if
this
case
is
reversed,
that
there
will
create
an
exception
to
the
bright
line
rule
that
has
been
created
by
this
court
in
edwards,
in
roberson,
and
in
minnick
which
will
have
no
countervailing...
nothing
on
the
positive
side.
the
government
says
in
their
brief
that
there
is
nothing
in
affirming
this
case
that
would
not
advance
the
purpose
underlying
the
bright
line
rule.
look
at
the...
what
we
expect
to
get
from
a
bright
line
rule:
provide
100
percent
assurance
that
confessions
are
not
the
result
of
a
coercive
pressure.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
no,
and--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--that's
correct,
and
if
i
may
explain.
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
retroactive.
it's
not
prospective.
it
only
applies
to
those
offenses
that
the
person
may
have
committed
before
he
invoked
his
miranda
rights.
something
that
the
person
does
after
say,
while
he's
in
prison,
that
previous
request
for
counsel
doesn't
apply.
the
police
could
question
him
about
that
offense.
what
we're
speaking
of
here
is
only
those
activities
that
he
did
prior
to
the
date
that
he
was
arrested,
he
requested
an
attorney,
and
he
was
continually
incarcerated
thereafter.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
well,
he...
at
the
point
where
he's
arrested,
he
says,
i
do
not
feel
that
i
am
capable
of
talking
to
the
police
without
an
attorney
present.
why
should
that
expire?
we
would
argue
that
it
doesn't
need
to
expire.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
certainly
there...
the
risk
of
badgering
decreases
over
time,
and
certainly
after
sentencing,
the
person
is
in
a
much
stronger
psychological
position
to
deal
with
the
authorities.
presentencing
he's
certainly
in
his
weakest
psychological
state
of
mind.
he's
sitting
there
waiting
for
a
court
to
sentence
him,
and
the
pressures
that
bear
on
a
person
in
that
position
have
to
be
greater
presentencing
than
postsentencing.
although
my
position
is
that
his
edwards
right
should
apply
postsentencing,
certainly
we
would
still
have
a
bright
line
if
the
court
said
that
after
he
has
been
sentenced,
then
the
edwards
rule
doesn't
apply.
but
my
position
still
would
be
that
since
it
only
applies
to
those
activities
that
occurred
prior
to
the
request
for
his
attorney,
that
truly
the
need...
extending
it
past
the
time
of
sentencing
just
lowers
the
likelihood
that
they're
going
to
come
to
him
and
question
him
about
a
case
that
occurred
in
that
time
frame
prior
to
it.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
no,
i
don't.
3501,
though,
is
a...
anytime
a
statement
is
made,
it
seems
as
though
that
there
is
always
a
hearing
to
find
out
whether
it
was
voluntary,
whether
it
met...
meets
all
the
parameters
that
have
been
dictated
by
the
united
states
code
and
by
this
court.
although
not
raised
by
the
government,
i
think
those
hearings...
i
think
3501
is
something
that's
litigated
every
day
in
the
criminal
courts
of
this
country.
nobody
raises
that
statute
by
name,
but
that's
the
hearings
that
they
have.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
they
still
rely
on
the
opinions
given
by
this
court
in
the
miranda
and
the
edwards
line
of
cases
and
not
on
section
3501
of
the
criminal
code.
in
addition
to
maintaining
the
bright
line
we
have,
in
reversing
this
case,
we
would...
of
the
four
factors
that
have
been
identified
on
the
need
for
a
bright
rule
in
this
area,
one,
100
percent
assurance
that
there's
no
coercive
pressure;
two,
to
prevent
badgering;
three,
to
conserve
judicial
resources.
reversing
this
case
will
send
us
then
into
another
totality
of
the
circumstance
scenario
where
we
must--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--when
i
said
nothing
to
be
gained,
i
was
speaking
in
terms
of
the
bright
line
rule
that
this
court
has
established
in
edwards
and
roberson.
yes,
without
the
bright
line
rule,
there
may
be
circumstances
where
more
probative
confessions
or
statements
are
admitted.
however,
we
still
don't
know
at
that
point
whether
we've
met
the
first
requirement,
and
that
is
whether
that
statement
was
a
result
of
any
coercive
pressure.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
well,
if
we're
talking...
in
this...
in
mr.
green's
case,
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
eliminating
or
carving
an
exception
out
of
the
bright
line
rule.
we
don't
know
whether...
if
we
carve
this
exception,
whether
we're
making
a...
allowing
a
statement
in
that
was
given
as
a
result
of
some
coercive
pressures.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
if
you
apply
it
after
the
guilty
plea,
you
still
have
a
bright
line,
but
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
bright
line
is
to
ensure
that
these
things
are
not
the
result
of
coercive
pressure.
and
i
think
just
at
the
guilty
plea,
you
don't
have
that
assurance.
i
think--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--after
sentencing,
i
think
you
would
have
that
assurance.
i
think
the
person
is
in
a
much
different
psychological
state
of
mind
after
sentencing.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
i
still
think
it
should
last
forever,
but
after
sentencing
would
certainly
be
a
better
break
if
this
court
was
going
to
end
it
than
it
would
be
after
a
plea
and
before
sentencing.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
in
the
district
of
columbia
superior
court,
it's
6
weeks
to
prepare
a
presentence
report.
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions,
it's
now
a
period
of
2
months
between
the
entry
of
a
plea
and
the
preparation
of
the
presentence
report
and
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
and
the...
and
certainly
the
load
in
superior
court.
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
created...
extended
it
after...
once
they
were--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
it
can
be
done
with
his
lawyer.
a
lot
of
times
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
is
waived.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
if
the
defendant
requests,
it
can
be
done
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
know
of
other
jurisdictions
where
an
attorney
is
allowed
to
be
present.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
they
still
put
his
background
in,
whatever
they
can
gain
from
his
family
from
the--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--yes,
and
some
reports...
the
person
will
talk
about
his
background,
but
not
about
the
offense
itself,
in
which
case
his
background
is
there,
but
the
offense
conduct
is
missing.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
well,
the
guidelines
changed
as
of
november
1
of
this
year
so
that
a
plea
of
guilty
automatically
entitles
him
to
two
points
off
and
possibly
three
if
he
does
it
at
an
early
time.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
just
because
he
stands
up
in
court
and
says
i'm
guilty.
he
does
not
have
to
talk
about
the
offense
whatsoever
to
get
either
two
and
possibly
even
three
points
off.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
the
only
way
he
can
get
any
further
points
off
is
for
him
to
cooperate
with
the
united
states
and
receive
a
letter
under
section
5k.1
of
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines.
so...
and
if
he's--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--almost
exclusively
they're
not
interested
in
somebody
who
has
already
pled
guilty.
they
want
his
cooperation
in
charging
somebody
else.
they
want
him
to
cooperate
either--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--for
the
letter.
there's
no
additional
points.
it's
just...
it's
either
a
5k.1
letter...
motion
to
reduce
the
sentence--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--in
the
district
of
columbia,
they
take
place
at
the
district
of
columbia
jail.
at
the
federal
court,
if
it's
a
federal
prisoner--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--edwards
does
apply.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
well,
the
probation
officer
isn't
law
enforcement.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
i
wouldn't
consider
the
probation
officer--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--he's
part
of
the
government.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
he's
part
of
the
court
system.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
and
he's
only
talking
in
the
context
of
the
one
offense
when
he
talks
to
the
probation
officer.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
no.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
he
can.
on
the
other
hand,
he
may
hold
something
back.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
he
has
the
right
not
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
probation
officer--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--pardon
me?
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
his
attorney...
at
that
time,
he
should
have
a
sixth...
he
has
an
attorney
at
that
time
who
could
tell
him
to
cooperate
or
not
to
cooperate.
and
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
right
would
take
over
and
control
that
situation.
indeed,
if
he
has
a
lawyer
and
there
is
something
out
there
about
the
offense
that
could
increase
his
penalty,
the
lawyer
wouldn't
instruct
him
not
to
cooperate
with
the
presentence
report
writer.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
no.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
it's--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--yes.
it's
certainly
not
the
police
investigating
a
different
offense.
they're
only
there
to
talk
about
that
offense
and
his
background.
and
while
we're
talking
about
a
guilty
plea,
there's
nothing
in
a
guilty
plea
that
says,
listen,
i
want
to
open
the
dialogue
with
the
law
enforcement
people.
here
i
am.
i'm...
in
this
limited
purpose,
i
am
entering
a
plea
just
to
this
offense,
and
i
have
my
attorney
present.
those
are
the
considerations,
and
those
are
what
the
government
argues
in
their
brief,
one
of
the
three
considerations
that
we
should...
this
court
should
change
the
rule
in
edwards,
that
by
pleading
guilty,
he
has
opened
the
dialogue
with
the
police.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
he
has
only
opened
the
dialogue
with
the
police
in
the
context
of
the
one
offense
with
his
lawyer
present.
the
government's
third
argument
that
this
case
differs
from
roberson
v.
arizona
and
minnick
v.
mississippi...
i
believe
those
two
cases
should
be
read
together.
in
roberson
we
have
police
who
at
3
days
later
came
and
talked
to
roberson,
and
in
minnick
we
had
the
case
where
he
comes...
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
speak
with
his
counsel,
but
his
counsel
wasn't
present.
i
think
if
we
read
those
two
cases
together,
we
have
exactly
the
same
case
that
mr.
green
has.
he
was
held.
he
was
permitted
to
speak
with
his
attorney,
and
they
came
and
spoke
to
him
about
a
different
offense
than
the
one
he
was
held
on.
the
5
months
lapse
which
the
government
argues...
the
second
thing
the
government
argues
as
a
reason
to
distinguish
mr.
green.
again,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
roberson,
coercive
pressures
increase
as
custody
is
prolonged.
keep
in
mind
that
every
occasion
that
mr.
green
left
the
lorton
or
d.c.
jail,
he
was
met
by
his
attorney
in
a
courtroom.
he
was
dependent
upon
his
attorney
during
the
whole
5
months
that
he
was
present.
he
was
pending
sentencing.
he's
most
vulnerable
at
that
time
to
any...
than
any
other
time
in
his
life.
he's
waiting
for
a
judge
to
pronounce
the
sentence.
what
sentence
that's
going
to
be
depends
on
what
he
does,
what
he
tells
his
probation
officer,
what
the
police
or
what
the
united...
what
government
may
tell
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing
as
to--
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
--that's
correct.
but
he
has
been
advised
by
his
attorney
at
that
time
in
what
context
he
should
speak
with
the
probation
officer.
he
has
been
advised
that
they're
only
going
to
ask
him
about
the
one
offense,
the
offense
that
he
pled
guilty
to.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
not
in
my
experience.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
there
are
judges
i
am
aware
of
who
require
the
lawyers
to
be
present
during
the
interview,
and
that's
all
occurred
since
they
passed
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines,
and
those
would
be
district
court
cases,
federal
court
cases.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
yes.
in
the
district
of
columbia
it
is.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
no.
the
lawyer
is
allowed
to
attend
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
they
just
walk
in.
mr.
joseph
r.
conte
if
there's
no
further
questions.
