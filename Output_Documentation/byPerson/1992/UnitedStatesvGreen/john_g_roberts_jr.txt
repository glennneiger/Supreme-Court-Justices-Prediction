chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
that
court
held
that
in
respondent's
trial
for
first
degree
murder,
the
jury
must
never
know
that
he
voluntarily
confessed
to
the
crime
after
receiving
miranda
warnings
and
expressly
waiving
his
rights
because
5
months
before
confessing,
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
when
he
was
arrested
on
an
unrelated
drug
charge,
a
charge
he
resolved
with
a
guilty
plea
3
months
before
being
questioned
about
the
murder.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
respondent
was
arrested
on
a
drug
charge.
he
was
read
his
miranda
rights
by
the
book.
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel.
the
police
immediately
stopped
the
proceedings,
and
respondent
was
provided
with
an
attorney.
2
months
later,
he
pled
guilty
to
a
lesser
drug
charge
as
part
of
a
plea
bargain.
3
months
after
that,
he
was...
while
still
in
custody,
he
was
arrested
for
murder,
a
charge
unrelated
to
the
drug
offense.
he
was
again
read
his
miranda
rights,
and
this
time
he
chose
to
waive
them,
giving
the
police
a
videotaped
statement
in
which
he
confessed
to
his
role
in
the
murder.
the
lower
courts
reluctantly
suppressed
the
confession,
even
though
they
found
it
voluntary
and
found
respondent's
waiver
knowing
and
intelligent.
they
thought
this
result
compelled
by
this
court's
decision
in
edwards
against
arizona
and
the
rule
that
once
a
suspect
invokes
his
right
to
counsel,
the
police
may
not
reinitiate
questioning,
and
if
they
do,
the
suspect's
statements
are
presumed
to
be
involuntary.
we--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
that
i
think
would
be
barred
by
roberson.
the
first
argument--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
first
line...
our
basic
submission
this
morning
is
that
the
guilty
plea
is
a
dramatic
change
in
circumstances
that
justifies
lifting
the
presumption.
this
court
has
never
had
occasion
to
consider
whether
the
edwards
presumption
continues
in
the
face
of
a
guilty
verdict,
let
alone
a
guilty
plea.
in
edwards,
in
roberson,
and
in
minnick,
the
subject
was
in
the
same
position
when
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
as
when
the
police
reinitiated
questioning,
a
pretrial
suspect.
here,
however,
in
the
meantime,
the
respondent
has
been
found
guilty
on
the
matter
that
led
to
his
arrest
and
on
which
he...
which
triggered
his
miranda
rights
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
had
counsel,
of
course,
in
entering
the
guilty
plea
and
had
consulted
with
his
attorney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
and,
of
course,
the
police--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
he
didn't
even
have
to
say
that,
of
course,
with
respect
to
the
drug
charge.
the
sixth
amendment
would
prevent
the
police
from
interrogating
the
respondent
on
the
drug
charge
and
using
that
at
sentencing.
so,
that's
not
an
issue.
the
only
question
would
be
then
whether
there's
a...
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
there
it
seems
to
us
that
the
invocation
is
respected,
as
it
was
here.
the
police
immediately
stopped
the
proceedings,
but
when
there
has
been
a
change
in
circumstances
like
the
entry
of
a
guilty
plea,
that
there
is
no
reasor
to
presume
that
the
suspect's
wishes
continue.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
the
police
have
free
rein
to
question
him,
and
they
should
presume
now
that
he's
willing
to
talk
to
the
police
without
his
attorney,
just
that
the
situation
has
changed
sufficiently
that
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know
what
his
reasoning
was.
he
may
have
thought,
as
suspects
often
do,
that
by
giving
a
statement--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
had
been
in
custody.
he
may
have
thought
that
by
giving
a
statement,
he
would
exculpate
himself
and
direct
the
police
in
another
direction.
the
statement
had
the
exact
opposite
effect.
it
was
tantamount
to
a
confession.
but
the
point
is
that
the
matter
on
which
he
was
originally
arrested
and
which
originally
triggered
his
miranda
rights
has
been
resolved.
the
investigative
process--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--on...
and
use
that
material
in
enhancing
his
sentence
on
the
drug
charge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
drug
charge,
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
attaches.
the
issue
here
is
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
and
whether
or
not
the
edwards
presumption
should
continue
in
effect
after
a
guilty
plea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
investigative
process--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
difference
is
that
the
investigative
process
on
the
drug
charge,
which
is
of
course
what
miranda
was
centrally
concerned
about,
is
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
police
are
unlikely
to
continue
an
investigation
on
sentencing,
and
if
they
do,
his
attorney--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
if
he
is
questioned--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
to
the
drug
charge
and
sentencing
on
the
drug
charge.
it
doesn't
apply...
the
sixth
amendment
right--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what's
dramatically
different
is
that
when
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
he
was
a
suspect
on
a
drug
charge.
when
the
police
reapproached
him,
he
was
no
longer
a
suspect.
he
was
a
convict.
he
had
been
found
guilty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
that
dramatic
change
in
circumstances
might
alter
his
judgment
about
whether
to
talk
to
the
police
without
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
would
not
because
the
sixth
amendment
protects
him
there.
he
has
the
right
to
counsel
in
any
custodial
interrogation
with
respect
to
the
drug
charge,
but
as
the
court
explained
in
mcneil,
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
murder
charge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
because
again,
his
lawyer
wasn't
present
at
that
proceeding.
it
would
then
become
a
stage
in
the
drug
proceeding,
and
i
don't
think
that
could
be
used
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
how
guilty
pleas
have
been
treated
elsewhere,
for
example,
in
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
a
guilty
plea
that
is
still
subject
to
an
appeal,
for
example,
may
still
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
and
the
cases
have
also
held,
although
it's
not
specifically
addressed
in
the
federal
rules,
that
if
sentencing
is
still
pending
on
the
guilty
plea,
the
guilty
plea
may
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
brightness
of
the
line
is
absolutely
paramount
to
all
other
factors.
the
guilty--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far.
the
dichotomy
between
the
clear
edwards
rule
and
our
proposal
today
i
think
is
a
very
false
one.
when
the
court
applies
edwards
today,
it
looks
at
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
it
has
to
look
to
see
if
the
individual
is
in
custody.
it
has
to
look
to
see
if
what
he
has
done
amounts
to
an
invocation
of
his
right
to
counsel.
it
has
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
he
has
waived
that
invocation
by
subsequent
initiation.
it
has
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
what
the
police
are
doing
is
interrogation,
and
although
this
court
hasn't
decided
it
yet,
we
think
they
have
to
look
to
see
to
make
sure
he
has
been
continuously
in
custody.
all
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
are
additional
relevant
factors
to
consider,
factors
that
look
to
the
same
concerns
that
the
ones
the
court
already
considers
to
look
to,
to
determine
if
there's
a
reasonable
end
to
the
edwards
presumption.
now,
to
the
extent
a
bright
line
is
needed,
the
guilty
verdict
is,
of
course,
a
bright
line,
but
beyond
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--sentencing
would
be
another
bright
line.
the
guilty
verdict
is
significant
because
it
is
addressed
to
the
same
concerns
that
trigger
miranda.
miranda
is
concerned
about
the
investigative
process.
that's
at
an
end
when
the
defendant
has
been
found
guilty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
he's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
sentencing
isn't
directed
to
the
concern
of
miranda,
which
is
investigation.
a
suspect
invokes
his
right
to
counsel
presumably
because
he's
afraid
that
without
counsel
he'll
say
something
incriminating
and
be
found
guilty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
miranda
applies
to
coercive
pressures
in
custodial
interrogation.
now,
the
sixth
amendment,
as
i
indicated,
protects
if
the
police
are
questioning
him
for
information
to
use
at
sentencing.
with
a
probation
officer
or
something
like
that,
there's
certainly
a
split
as
to
whether
the
sixth
amendment
applies,
but
even
if
it
doesn't,
that
is
in
our
position
not
custodial
interrogation.
and
so,
miranda
and
edwards
wouldn't
apply
in
any
event.
but
with
respect
to
the
need
for
a
bright
line,
our
position
is
that,
first
of
all,
the
guilty
plea
is
a
bright
line,
but
a
line
needs
more
than
brightness
to
commend
it
when
it
has
the
consequence
of
excluding
a
voluntary,
warned
confession
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's...
that
is
what
the
probation
officer
does,
not
the
prosecutor's
office.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--assuming
there's
no
sixth
amendment
right
in
the
probation
process...
and
that's
an
issue
on
which
the
courts
have
split,
yes.
but
it's
because
we
don't
regard
the
probation
procedure
as
custodial
interrogation.
so,
miranda
isn't
triggered
by
that
at
all,
and
neither
then,
of
course,
would
edwards
be.
but
the
brightness
of
the
line
in
our
view
cannot
be
the
only
consideration.
you
need
to
look,
as
this
court
has
indicated,
to
the
purpose
that
the
rule
is
serving.
this
is
a
prophylactic
rule
created
and
imposed
by
this
court,
and
it
must
be
justified
by
reference
to
its
purpose.
now,
the
purpose
here
is
not,
as
it
was
in
edwards,
in
roberson,
in
minnick,
to
prevent
police
badgering.
there's
no
plausible
basis
on
which
that
is
a
concern
in
this
case.
the
suspect
was
not
questioned
by
the
police
for
5
months
after
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel.
the
police
promptly
respected
his
right
to
counsel
when
he
invoked
it.
they
approached
him
on
a
different
offense.
he
has
consulted
with
his
attorney.
it
is
implausible
to
suppose
that
that
suspect's
reaction,
when
the
police
come
back
to
him,
is
going
to
be
i
wish
you
would
stop
badgering
me.
the
purpose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
our
position
there
was
that
the
approach
on
a
different
offense
was
sufficient
to
dissipate
the
concern
that
edwards
was
based
upon.
the
purpose
not...
is
here
not
to
prevent
police
badgering.
it's
to
protect
the
ease
of
administration,
the
bright
line
aspect,
of
a
prophylactic
rule,
edwards,
created
by
this
court
to
protect
another
prophylactic
rule,
miranda,
which
in
turn
is
designed
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment.
here
we
have
no
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
itself.
the
confession
was
found
by
both
lower
courts
to
be
voluntary.
nor
do
we
have
any
violation
of
miranda
itself.
the
familiar
warnings
were
given
and
were
found
by
both
lower
courts
to
be
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived.
nor
is
there
any
concern
here
with
police
badgering,
the
concern
that
led
to
edwards
in
the
first
place.
in
those
circumstances,
we
think
protecting
the
ease
of
administration
of
a
second
level
prophylactic
rule
is
an
insufficient
justification
to
keep
out
this
voluntary,
warned
confession.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
they
certainly
could
do
that.
we
think
they
could
ask
him
about
the
drug
charge
in
those
circumstances
as
well,
because
the
break
in
custody
would
lift,
we
think,
and
all
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
he's
in
jail,
we
think
with
a
sufficient
passage
of
time,
yes,
they
can.
now,
the
first
thing
they
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
now,
the
first
thing
they
say,
of
course--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
think
that
if
the
presumption
is
no
longer
justified
by
its
purpose,
then
there's
no
basis
for
the
imposition
of
the
prophylactic
rule
that
this
court
has
imposed.
now,
edwards,
of
course,
was
a
quite
different
case.
the
second
approach
was
not
5
months
later;
it
was
the
next
morning.
it
concerned
not
an
entirely
unrelated
offense,
but
the
same
offense.
in
the
meantime,
the
suspect
had
no
opportunity,
was
not
permitted
to
consult
with
his
attorney.
and,
in
fact,
when
the
police
officers
came
back
the
second
time,
the
suspect
said
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
them,
and
he
was
told
that
he
had
to.
the
facts
are
not
at
all
similar
to
those
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
we
think
that
yes,
the
presumption
should
not
continue
on
indefinitely.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--2
months
is
enough
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--1
month
is
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
2
days
is
probably
not
enough.
now,
it
isn't
a
bright
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
is
a
line
that
looks...
first
of
all,
as
i'll
reiterate,
our
principal
submission
is
the
finding
of
guilt.
if
brightness
is
the
paramount
concern
that
trumps
even
keeping
out
this
voluntary,
warned
confession--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
the
guilty
plea,
the
finding
of
guilt,
is
of
course
a
very
sharp
and
bright
line,
and
that
is
our
principal
submission.
we
also
think
that
the
combination
of
the
factors
in
roberson
and
minnick,
having
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
an
attorney
and
the
approach
being
on
an
entirely
unrelated
offense,
is
also
sufficient
to
lift
the
edwards
presumption,
and
that
also
is
a
bright
line.
beyond
that,
we
do
think
time
is
a
relevant
factor.
whether
or
not
a
suspect
is
in
custody
is
a
critical
factor
to
consider
in
applying
edwards,
and
as
your
honor
indicated
in
a
prior
opinion,
that's
a
very
slippery
concept,
not
a
bright
line.
whether
the
suspect
has
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
his
miranda
right,
not
his
sixth
amendment
right,
is
not
a
bright
line,
as
this
court
has
experienced
in
some
of
those
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
why
it
has
never
been
cited.
that's
the
provision,
of
course,
that
on
its
face
purports
to
overturn
this
court's
decision
in
miranda.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
didn't
rely
on
it
below
in
this
case,
and
so
we're
not
in
a
position
to
rely
upon
it
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
can't
explain
why
it
hasn't
been
repeatedly
cited
other
than
perhaps
some
concern--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i'm
not
aware
that
it
ever
has
been.
all
i
can
say
is
it
wasn't
relied
on
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
we're
not
relying
on
it
here.
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
not
aware
that
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
statute
does
overrule
the
need
for
the
miranda
warnings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
that
we
have
relied
on
it
at
any
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
this
case
i'm
not
sure...
and
in
cases
like
this
where
we're
arguing
that
the
confession
should
be
admitted,
it's
because
we
believe
it's
consistent
with
miranda
and
the
other
cases
as
we
believe
this
one
is.
and
so,
there's
no
need
to
take
what
would
be
the
ultimate
fall-back
position
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
it
violated
miranda
because
the
statute
says
miranda
is
no
longer
good
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
and
of
course,
it's
open
to
the
court
to
decide
it
on
that
basis.
i
just...
since
we
have
not
relied
on
it
below,
we're
not
relying
on
it
here.
the
reason
we
think
it
is
important
that
there
be
some
limitation
to
the
edwards
presumption
that
it
not
extend
indefinitely
into
the
future
is
that
it
imposes
a
very
serious
impediment
upon
law
enforcement.
people
in
custody
are
a
very
valuable
investigative
resource
for
the
police.
not
only
have
they
often
committed
other
crimes
themselves,
but
often
have
information
about
who
has
committed
other
crimes.
the
question
posed
by
edwards
to
the
police
officer
is,
can
i
question
this
individual
who's
in
custody.
people
arrive
at
custody
by
very
circuitous
routes.
it's
not
unusual
for
a
defendant
to
be
arrested
in
california,
detained
and
questioned
there,
transferred
to
new
york,
detained
and
questioned
there
by
different
authorities,
and
then
transferred
to
illinois
to
await
trial
on
still
different
charges.
a
police
officer
in
illinois
may
know
nothing
more
than
that
the
individual
is
in
custody
and
may
have
information
about
an
offense
that
he's
investigating.
now,
what
does
the
officer
have
to
do?
the
officer,
under
the
supposedly
clear
guidance
of
edwards,
has
to
find
out
if
the
individual
has
ever
invoked
his
right
to
counsel,
anytime,
anyplace
before
any
authorities,
whether
he
has
been
continuously
in
custody
since
that
time,
whether
at
any
time
he
has
initiated
contact
with
the
police
and
thereby
waived
his
previous
invocation.
and
the
answers
to
those
questions
don't
follow
the
prisoner
around
on
a
card.
they
may
be
with
the
state
officials
in
california,
the
bail
officer
in
illinois,
with
the
fbi
in
new
york.
and
the
reason
it
is
important
that
there
be
clear
guidance
to
the
police...
we
think
our
rule
provides
clear
guidance...
is
that
these
people
have
oftentimes
valuable
information
about
other
crimes.
our
submission
today
would
put
a
reasonable
parameter
on
what
the
officer
has
to
ask.
if
he
finds
out
that
the
defendant
is
there
because
he
has
pled
guilty
or
been
found
guilty,
then
the
officer
doesn't
need
to
go
back
beyond
that
in
this
little
mini-investigation
he
must
conduct
before
even
approaching
the
individual.
and
keep
in
mind
that
the
first
thing
the
officer
says
when
he
approaches
is
not
tell
us
about
this
murder.
it
is,
you
have
the
right
to
have
an
attorney
present
before
answering
any
of
my
questions.
now,
the
one
thing
that
a
suspect
in
respondent's
position
knows
from
experience
and
is
reminded
of
by
the
second
administration
of
the
rights
is
that
that
right
will
be
respected.
that
is
why
this
case
is
very
different
from
edwards,
where
he
was
not
allowed
to
consult
with
his
attorney,
and
also
very
different
from
roberson
where
3
days
went
by
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
consult
with
his
attorney.
it's
also
different
from
minnick
because
there,
although
he
was
allowed
to
consult
with
his
attorney,
the
second
approach
concerned
the
same
offense,
and
a
very
short
period
of
time,
only
3
days,
had
elapsed.
and
again,
as
in
edwards,
the
suspect
was
told
he
had
to
talk
to
the
police
when
he
refused
to
do
so.
in
all
of
those
cases,
edwards,
roberson,
and
minnick,
there
was
a
very
real
concern,
the
court
concluded,
that
the
suspect
would
reasonably
think
that
the
miranda
rights
he
was
being
given
were
not
real.
if
the
police
keep
coming
back
to
the
suspect
after
he
invokes
his
rights,
he
could
decide
they
don't
mean
it
when
they
say
i
have
these
various
rights.
that's
not
a
plausible
concern
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
exactly
what
it
is
that
we're
suggesting
today.
it
is
not
that
when
there
is
a
finding
of
guilt
or,
we
think
in
particular,
a
guilty
plea,
police
may
now
presume
that
the
suspect
is
willing
to
talk
to
them
without
his
attorney.
all
we're
saying
is
that
the
facts
have
changed
to
such
an
extent
that
it
is
reasonable
to
once
again
regard
that
question
as
an
open
question,
and
the
first
thing
that
the
suspect
will
be
reminded
of
is
that
he
has
a
right
not
to
talk
to
the
police
without
his
attorney.
if
he
still...
given
the
change
in
the
situation,
if
he
still
does
not
wish
to
talk
to
the
police
without
an
attorney,
all
he
has
to
do
is
say
so.
it
worked
the
last
time,
and
he
knows
it
will
work
again.
in
other
words,
the
deck
has
been
reshuffled,
he
has
been
dealt
a
new
hand,
and
there's
no
reason
to
presume
that
his
opening
bid
is
going
to
be
the
same.
that's
why
we
think
it
is
the
finding
of
guilt
and
the
guilty
plea
that
is
a
sufficient
change
in
circumstances
that
justifies
reopening
the
question
once
again.
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
the
guilty
plea
and
sentencing,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
he
cannot
be
interrogated
for
information
to
be
used
at
sentencing
on
the
drug
charge,
and
under...
because
it
is
not
custodial
interrogation,
questioning
by
a
court
official...
that's
why
the
warnings
are
not
given...
the
edwards
presumption
doesn't
apply
in
the
first
place.
that's
why
we
think
it
is
the
guilty
plea,
the
guilty
verdict,
rather
than
sentencing
that
is
a
determining
factor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
an
officer
of
the
court,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
those.
there
are...
there
is
a
split
among
the...
in
the
lower
courts
over
whether
or
not
the
sixth
amendment
right
applies
at
the
probation
officer
interview.
and
if
it
does,
of
course,
then
they
can't
be
used
at
sentencing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
my
understanding,
yes,
that
a
probation
officer
does
not
give
miranda
warnings
and,
we
submit,
is
not
required
to
because
that's
not
custodial
interrogation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
