justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
i
suppose
if
the
officers
went
back
to
him
a
day
after
he
had
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
as
long
as
it
was
about
a
different
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
is
your
line
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
make
any
difference
if
he
had
counsel?
i
suppose
he
still
had
counsel.
he
hadn't
been
sentenced
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
then
he
was
going
to
have
counsel
i
suppose
at
sentencing.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
counsel
had
said
to
the
government
and,
by
the
way,
i
don't
want
you
talking...
going
back
and
quizzing
my
client
about
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
strange.
isn't
it
strange
that
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel
on
a
drug
charge
and...
but
with
a
much
more
serious
charge,
he
didn't
invoke
his
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
had
been
in
custody
all
this
time,
hadn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
your
argument
so
far
would
cover
going
back
to
the
defendant
asking
him
about
another
crime.
say
he's
out
on
bail
for
5
months
before
trial.
well,
during
the
fifth
month
the
government
goes
back
to
him
and
said
we
don't
want
to
ask...
question
you
about
this
drug
charge
that
you're
about
to
be
tried
for.
we
want
to
ask
you
about
a
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he's
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
he
hasn't
been
tried
on
the
drug
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
argument
would...
there
has
been
a
sufficient
passage
of
time
to
justify
going
back
to
him
contrary
to
edwards
or
that
edwards
just
wears
out
after
2
or
3
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
even
a
line,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say...
what
if
we
agree
with
the
government?
once
the
plea
of
guilty
is
accepted,
that's
as
bright
as
you
can
get,
isn't
it?
so
is
sentencing,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
after
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
don't...
you
say
edwards
wouldn't
last
forever,
but
after
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
experience,
what
is
the
usual
time
between
a
conviction
and
sentencing
or
a
plea
of
guilty
and
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
because
of
the
load,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
preparing
a
presentence
report,
is
it
characteristic
to
talk
to
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
his
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
defendant
requests--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
goes
into
the
presentence
report
if
the
defendant
refuses
to
talk
to
the
probation
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there...
but
all
they
say
is
he
refused
to
talk?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
interview...
where
does
the
interview
normally
take
place
with
the
probation
officer
in...
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
presentence
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
doesn't
edwards
apply
at
that
juncture?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
it's
violating
his
rights
for
the
probation
officer
to
go
to
the
jail
and
approach
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
part
of
the
government.
he's
a
law
enforcement--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he's
a
law
enforcement
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
he
talks...
he
approaches
him
and
talks
to
him.
does
the
probation
officer
give
him
miranda
warnings?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
talks
to
them
and
he...
the
defendant
says
a
lot
of
things
that
is
going
to
harm
him
at
sentencing.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
doesn't
edwards
apply
at
that
juncture?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he
isn't
told
that
he
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
isn't
told
that
he
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
just
a
different
context
i
suppose
that
you
don't
say...
you
don't
tell
the
probation
officer,
now,
remember,
don't
go
near
him
unless
he
asks
you
to
come.
you
don't
say
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
the
probation
officer.
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
characteristic
of
lawyers
to
try
to
find
out
when
the
interview
is
going
to
take
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the...
i
don't
suppose
the
probation
officer...
who
do
they
ask?
the
probation
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
rarely
says
it's
none
of
your
business,
i
suppose.
