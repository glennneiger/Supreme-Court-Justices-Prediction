well,
presumably,
if
he
were
allowed
to
be
questioned
about
the
murder
charge
and
confessed
it,
couldn't
that
be
used
at
the
sentencing
then
on
the
drug
charge
to
augment
his
sentence
in
some
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i'm
wondering
whether
the
cutoff
time
might
not
be
the
sentencing
on
the
drug
charge
rather
than
the
entry
of
the
plea,
because
it
isn't
clear
to
me
how
the
information
you
would
learn
on
questioning
him
after
the
plea
and
before
sentencing
wouldn't
somehow
be
used
at
the
sentencing
on
the
drug
charge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
that
there
should
be
some
bright
line
test
for
any
cutoff
of
the
duration
of
the
edwards
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you'd
have
us
apply
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
would
sentencing
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
what
you
would
say.
suppose
he
had
remained
in
custody
and
it
had
been
3
months
and
the
police
hadn't
asked
him
anything
and
no
guilty
plea.
now,
is
that
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
2
months?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
1
month?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
2
days?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
one
concern
certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
edwards
has
no
time
limits
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
none.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
if
the
defendant
is
sentenced,
let's
say,
to
a
life
sentence
in
connection
with
the
drug
charge,
at
no
time
then
would
the
government
ever
be
able
to
go
back
and
ask
him
if
he
had
waived...
give
him
his
miranda
rights
and
talk
to
him
about
the
murder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
edwards
rule
might
expire
at
some
point,
certainly
after
he
is
sentenced
under
the
drug
charge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if--
--the
concern,
of
course,
was...
in
edwards
was
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
being
badgered
by
the
police
in
an
effort
to
get
information
in
connection
with
the
charge
that
had
been
made,
the
drug
charge
in
this
case.
now,
i
wouldn't
think
that
after
sentencing,
there
would
be
any
risk
of
badgering
him
about
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
why
the
statute,
18
u.s.
code
3501,
does
not
bear
on
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
statute
says
something
to
the
effect
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
various
factors
is
not
conclusive.
