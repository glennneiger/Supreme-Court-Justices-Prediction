justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
after
a
guilty
plea
and
before
sentencing,
the
defendant
may
feel
very
real
pressure
to
cooperate
with
the
police
in
order
to
obtain
lenient
treatment
on
his
sentencing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that's...
if
we're
going
to
draw
this
line,
sentencing
is
a
much
more
sensible
place
to
draw
it
if
this
is
how
we're
going
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
question
of
coercive
pressures.
there
are
substantial
coercive
pressures
on
the
prisoner
when
he
knows
that
he's
going
to
be
sentenced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
government
take
a
position
in
roberson?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
that
cooperation
extend
to
other
offenses
and
other
investigations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
if
the
defendant
cooperated
as
to
other
investigations
with
reference
to
other
crimes,
including
those
that
he
might
have
committed,
that
would
be
grounds
for
these
additional
points
and
for
the
letter?
