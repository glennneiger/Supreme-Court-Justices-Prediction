mr.
william
p.
fite
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
petitioner
has
stated
accurately
the
facts
of
the
case
except
on
one
point,
and
i
think
it's
important
in
our
decision...
or
in
your
decision.
and
that
is
we
know
what
did
occur,
but
the
factual
inquiry
as
to
why
it
occurred,
the
reason
it
occurred,
we
don't
know.
it
was
dismissed
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
all
we
know
is
the
record
was
not
produced.
we
don't
know
the
why
or
the
wherefore,
nor
have
we
proceeded
through
that
discovery
process.
counsel
has
brought
up
what
the
issue
before
you
is:
whether
there
is
absolute
immunity.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
general
scope
of
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
judicial
process
is
better
off
or
worse
off
by
granting
the
court
reporter
absolute
immunity.
and
the
respondent
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
i
think
three
areas
in
addressing
that
problem
or
that
question.
mr.
william
p.
fite
yes.
mr.
william
p.
fite
addressing
that
question,
i
would
need...
we
think
we
need
to
take
a
look
at
the
history
of
judicial
immunity.
you
say
do
we
need,
in
a
sense,
judicial
immunity
afforded
to
the
court
reporter?
my
interpretation
of
the
case
is...
and
this
is
founded
in
common
law,
is
that
judicial
immunity
essentially
comes
into
play
because
we
felt
that
judicial
immunity
had
to
be,
otherwise
the
process
of
making
decisions
of
the
judicial
process
would
be
damaged,
would
not
function
as
we
want
it
to
function.
the
question
i
see
here
for
the
court
to
resolve,
is
it
necessary
to
extend
that
immunity
on
to
a
court
reporter
to
accomplish
the
same
goal,
and
that
is
an
effective
judicial
process.
so
you
say
do...
do
we
need
to
extend
it
on,
is
it
a
policy
decision?
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
it
is
a
policy
decision
in
this
respect,
as
i
think
that
is
how
judicial
immunity
arrived.
it
was
decided
that
we
couldn't
have
collateral
attack,
we
wouldn't
have
finality
of
judgments,
wouldn't
have
an
arbitrator
that
concluded
matters
if
we
didn't
have
that.
so
i
think
you
do
need
to
look
at
history
in
looking
at...
at
a
court
reporter's
immunity.
mr.
william
p.
fite
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
william
p.
fite
we
do
not.
mr.
william
p.
fite
the
reason...
excuse
me.
mr.
william
p.
fite
i
don't
see
the
rule
needing
to
be
extended
in
that
situation.
i
think
we're
getting
back
to
the
question
of...
quickly...
on
court
reporters
not,
under
common
law,
being
afforded
immunity.
i
think
that's
answered
historically.
there
were
not
court
reporters
in
the
sense
we
think
of
them
until,
i
think,
1866,
and
then
finally
the
court
reporters
act
in
1944.
mr.
william
p.
fite
well,
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
was
immunity
for
that
process.
for
the
process
of
recording
what
went
on
in
a
courtroom
there
was
immunity,
because
that
immunity
was
afforded
through
judicial
immunity.
the
argument
of
respondent
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
reporter
is
part
and
parcel
of
that
judicial
process
in
the
courtroom.
that
process
up
until,
as
best
in
the
reading
i've
done
on
the
history...
and
i
think
the
national
court
reporters
association
did
an
excellent
job
of
reviewing
the
history...
that
process
was
taken
care
of
by
the
judge.
and
i
think
there
was
a
question
here
earlier,
what
about
judge's
notes.
i
think
the
petitioner
has
diminished
the
role
of
those
notes.
i
think
they
were
very
important,
as
my
understanding
is
that
the
notes
and
so
on
were
our
ability
to
get
to
the
appellate
level
with
a
record
and
have
finality
as
to
the
factual
issues
of
the
case,
so
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
judge
complied
with
the
law
in
making
the
decision.
and
so
i
think
correct...
we
need
to
look
at
historically.
i
think
you
can't
proceed
to
consider
a
court
reporter's
immunity
without
understanding
that
background
of
what
those
notes
mean.
and
i
think
they
mean
that
today.
if
you
look
at
the
court
rules
with
regard
to
what
the
record
is
to
consist
of,
it
is
still
the
judge's
record.
the
judge
has
the
final
say.
the
judge
reconstructs
a
record
that
does
not
exist,
as
it
was
done
in
this
case.
the
judge
passes
and...
on
questions
that
rise
about
the
record.
whether
it
be
the
trial
court
judge
or
the
appellate
court
judge,
that
decision
is
made.
mr.
william
p.
fite
my
understanding,
reading
the
rule,
although
i
have
never
followed
through
the
process...
well,
i
have
followed
through
the
process
that
the
judge
does
make
that
decision.
and
my
interpretation
of
the
rule
is
yes,
the
judge
has
the
final
say
in
certifying
that
record
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
there
remains
a
question,
as
i
understand
it
the
court
of
appeals
then
may
have
to
resolve
it.
i
think
the
court
rules
says
the
judge
will
correct
the
record...
i
don't
think
they
use
that
word...
to
be
sure
that
it
says
the
truth.
i
don't
know
where
we
would
turn
to
get
that
record
other
than
to
the...
to
the
court,
to
the
judge
or
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
determine
what
the
final
record
is.
as
a
practical
matter...
and
i
think
it's
very
important
in
this
decision
on
the
role
of
a
court
reporter...
if
you
have
a
question,
say
a
transcript
at
the
end
of
a
day,
and
there's
a
yes
and
a
no
and
you
think
it
should
be
yes
and
the
other
party
thinks
it
should
be
no,
and
you've
gotten
this
transcript,
you
would
say
what
happened,
what
is
the
record
going
to
say,
what
words
they
said,
and
i
think
that
role
would
fall
to
the
judge
to
correct
the
record.
the
record
is
the
court's
record
and
the
court
is
controlled
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
p.
fite
the
reading
i've
done,
that
specific
statement
is
not
made,
but
it's
certainly
implied
from
the
historical
events
that
occurred
with
regard
to
the
appellate
process.
they
talk
about
judge's
notes,
they
talk
about
where
does
the
record
come
from.
the
record,
as
i
understand
it,
historically
could
come
from
literally
whoever
might
assist
in
accumulating
that
record.
of
course,
the
judge's
notes
were
primary,
but
it
could
come
from
counsel,
it
could
come
from
whatever
source
in
order
to
establish
what
occurred
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
p.
fite
well
i
believe
historically
that
has
occurred.
i
think...
wasn't
charles
dickens,
i
believe,
a
court
reporter
or
reported
on
trials
at
one
time,
and
there
was...
that
sort
of
thing
occurred.
they
were
trying
to
find
what
they
eventually
found,
and
that
was
effective
court
reporters
to
do
this
job
in
a
logical,
sensible
way,
and
with
accuracy.
and
with
that
ability...
and
i
guess
it
initially
was
the
writing
skills
of
a
reporter,
it
now
has
become
somewhat
more
mechanical.
with
that
ability,
we
now
can
kind
of
say
that
record
is
accurate,
it
can
be
certified
and
we
know
and
we
can
trust
that
record
to
be
such.
the...
i
think
the...
addressing
the
question,
it's
also
important
to
understand
what
the
role
of
the
court
reporter
is.
i
think
we
tend
to
accept
the
fact
that
a
court
reporter
is
there
making
a
verbatim
transcript,
and
i
think
the
rules
say
a
verbatim
transcript
and
a
record
of
proceedings.
but
in
the
trial
of
a
case
a
court
reporter
takes
on
something
greater
by
far
than
just
the
task
of
recording
what's
done
there.
that's
the
mechanical
part,
but
a
court
reporter
in
every
sense,
as
i
see
it,
is
essentially
the
trial.
frequently
in
a
trial,
whether
you're
winning
or
losing,
you
may
be
more
concerned
that
the
court
reporter
hears
you
accurately,
that
the
record
reflects
what
goes
on,
than
the
court,
than
the
judge.
a
court
reporter
is
put
in
a
sensitive
position
in
fulfilling
that
role,
and
i
think
one
of
the
consequences
is...
is
to
make
that
court
reporter's
role,
that
sensitive
role
of
being
assured
that
they
are
recording
what
happened
fairly,
accurately,
with
no
bias,
that...
the
fact
that
there
could
be
qualified
immunity,
questions
of
fact
about
that,
i
think
would
inhibit
the
court
reporter
in
fulfilling
that
role.
mr.
william
p.
fite
where
i
see
the...
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--well
i...
i
can
see
that
the
court
reporter...
have
difficultly
in
shrinking
from
a
decision
on
inquiry
of
counsel
about
what
went
on
in
the
record,
does
the
record
show
this
or
does
the
record
show
that.
there
may
be...
i
don't
think
it's
the
most
important
reason
for
immunity,
but
i
think
there
well
could
be
that
a
court
reporter
with
this
litigious
counsel
on
one
side
saying
i
hope
you
got
that
record
right
today
when
he
said
no
or
she
said
no
and
yes...
it
may
have
an
intimidation
effect
on
the
ability
to
sit
back
in
an
unbiased
way,
an
independent
way,
and
do
the
record.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
most
important
part
of
this.
mr.
william
p.
fite
well--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--a
limited
number.
mr.
william
p.
fite
a
limited
number,
but
there
are
some.
mr.
william
p.
fite
i
think
if...
one,
the
role
of
a
court
reporter
is,
to
me,
one
that
is
difficult
to
comprehend
to
be
completed.
you
have
counsel
talking,
you
have
witnesses,
you
have
the
court,
and
you
have
to,
in
some
way,
discriminate
on
what
goes
in
that
record.
there
is
that
type
of
discretionary
act
in
court
reporting.
it's
inherent
in
trying
to
accomplish
that.
if
we
ever
come
up
with
an
ability
to
accomplish
it
without
ever
the
possibility
of
error,
without
any...
everything
being
recorded,
well
then
i
guess
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
no...
no
reporter
would
be
sued.
mr.
william
p.
fite
your
honor,
i
think
you're
right.
i
mean
i
can't
say
that
everything
that
a--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--well,
i
think
there
is
judgment
in
recording.
you're
right,
if
it's
there,
if
it's
not
confused
and
it's
not
entwined
with
other
things,
that
we
know
what
is
to
go
in
the
record,
then
it's
merely
a
matter
of
writing
it
down.
mr.
william
p.
fite
the
perfect
judge
doesn't
need
a
reporter,
if
somebody
could
record--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--well,
there's
another
element
to
that
too.
i
agree
with
your
honor.
another
element
is
at
times
the
court
reporter
needs
to
intrude
into
the
process,
needs
to
say
stop,
i
didn't
get
it,
i
need
to
have
you
stop
here.
now
what...
said,
and
essentially
defers
to
the
court
and
the
court,
of
course,
stops
the
proceedings.
but
even
with
that,
what
i
think
is
the
greatest
danger
flowing
from
failure
to
provide
absolute
immunity
to
a
court
reporter
is
that
i
think
you
create
a
question
of
fact,
a
question
of
fact
that
is
going
to
embroil
anybody
in
a
courtroom.
we
didn't
get
into
it
yet
in
this
case,
but
i
can
hardly
think
of
a
situation
where
somebody
says
the
record
is
wrong
that
every
player
in
that
process,
that
judicial
process,
the
courtroom,
isn't
potentially
a
fact
witness:
the
judge,
the
jury,
the
witness,
counsel,
everybody
else.
and
if
we
start
to
get
into
a
situation
where
there
is
the
potential
threat
of
that
sort
of
factual
inquiry,
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
a
long
way
towards
defeating
the
purpose
of
judicial
immunity.
mr.
william
p.
fite
we
don't
really
know
that
it
does
or
not
in
this
case.
but
the
question
asked,
chief
justice,
is
will
there
be
lawsuits
from
this.
the
petitioners
take
the
position
there
haven't
been
many
lawsuits,
therefore
what
are
we
worried
about.
court
reporters
generally
do
a
good
job;
there
isn't
a
flood
of
litigation
on
this.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what
the
future
would
hold
for
sure,
but
i
think
there
is
the
real
threat
that
once
the
supreme
court
has
spoken
and
every
counsel
who
loses...
and
generally
one
side
or
the
other
loses...
is
going
to
have
to
consider...
in
representing
their
client
who
is
disgruntled
by
the
fact
they
lost,
going
to
have
to
consider
as
one
of
the
potential
causes
of
action
a
claim
against
court
personnel,
particularly
the
court
reporter.
so
whether
that
means--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--i
can't
either,
and
i've
been
a
trial
attorney
for
some
years
now,
except
in
this
situation...
except
that
we
view
it
different
than
might...
it
might
be
viewed
depending
on
how
the
court
rules
in
this
case.
at
this
time
i
think,
one,
it
doesn't
take
anybody
well
versed
in
judicial
immunity
to
go
into
the
courtroom
for
the
first
time
and
realize
we
can't
be
suing
the
judge.
it
just
won't
work.
i
think
that
most
trial
counsel
have
looked
at
the
court
reporter
that
way.
it's
a
team
in
a
courtroom,
and
i
think
it's
been...
people
may
be
critical
of
a
great
deal
of
litigation.
in
this
case
it
was
a
pro
se
criminal
defendant
that
brought
the
case,
and
i
notice
a
number
of
those...
of
the
cases
come
that
route.
but
if
you
talk
to
a
trial
attorney
and
say
well
the
record
doesn't
look
right,
let's
sue
the
court
reporter,
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
considered.
i
think
they
felt...
saw
the
judge
and
the
court
reporter
as
a
team.
mr.
william
p.
fite
well,
then
that's
correct.
as
long
as
we
know
when
we
end
up
with
the
truth.
we
have,
as
the
record,
says
the
truth.
mr.
william
p.
fite
well--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--i
agree
with
that,
and
that's
why
the
judge
has...
is
controlling
of
that
record
and
says
yes
it
was
no,
or
yes
it
was.
but...
or
yes
it
was
the
other
way.
but
it...
it
seems
to
me
it
can
fall
into
this
sort
of
scenario
of
a
lawsuit.
the
record's
there,
the
judge
has
said
it
was
yes,
you
believe
it
was
no
and
you
sue
the
court
reporter
saying
you
put
it
down
wrong.
he
says
well
the
judge
said
that
it
was
yes;
wait
a
minute,
let
me
bring
in
a
jury
to
testify
about
that.
mr.
william
p.
fite
i
don't
know
if
it
is
in
that
sense.
there's
judicial
immunity,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
case
regarding
the...
a
court
reporter
immunity,
either
qualified
or
absolute.
mr.
william
p.
fite
that's
correct,
only...
only--
mr.
william
p.
fite
--not
that
i'm
aware
of
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
p.
fite
i
don't
know
if
that
can
be...
is
really
a
factor
in
this
decision.
mr.
william
p.
fite
but...
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
that
you
can
say
it's
a
flood
of
litigation.
but
as
i
said
earlier,
the
supreme
court
has
not
spoken
on
this
and
there
is
differences
between
the
various
circuits.
mr.

i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
amount
of
litigation
is
necessarily
the
criteria.
if
there
is
the
potential
threat,
the
creation
of
mistrust
within
the
courtroom
personnel,
i
think
you
have
defeated
to
some
degree
the
purpose
of
judicial
immunity.
now,
whether
that's
a
few
cases
that
come
out
or
whether
it's
a
floodgate
of
opening
of
cases,
i
don't
know.
but
i
do
think
that
the
dangers
that
flow
from
it
are
there
whether
there's
few
or
many.
the
three
areas
that
i
wanted
to
touch
on,
and
i
think
they
have
been
touched
on
in
the
questioning
that
have
been
posed,
is,
one,
historical,
that
i
think
the
court
reporter's
role
is
part
of
the
historical
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
judge.
the
other
is
the
role
of
the
court
reporter,
and
i
wanted,
i
felt
in
representing
respondent
in
this
case,
to
emphasize
what
the
court
reporter's
role
was
in
a
trial,
what
it
really
meant
in
the
day-to-day
trial
of
a
case.
and
third,
the
consequences.
and
looking
at
the
consequences
would
have
been
discussed,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
serious.
and
i
don't
think
it
has
to
do
with
how
many
cases
are
there.
but
once
you
open
the
door
and
start
to
allow
factual
inquiry,
which
may
well
happen
in
this
case
depending
on
the
rule
of
the
court...
as
once
you
open
the
door
and
say
what
went
on
in
the
courtroom
with
regard
to
the
court
reporter
that
is
a
factual
question,
then
i
think
you
are
defeating
judicial
immunity.
mr.
william
p.
fite
the...
well,
you
raise
a
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
there
remains
a
claim
here,
a
cause
of
action.
in
a
sense,
it
seems
to
me
your
addressing
a
question
that's
moot
in
this
case.
i
think
that
argument
could
be
made.
the...
i
think
you
could
take
that
position.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
addressed
the
issues
that
i
wanted
to.
thank
you.
