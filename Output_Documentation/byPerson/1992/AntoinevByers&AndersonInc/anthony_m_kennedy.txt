suppose
the
judge--
--so...
excuse
me.
suppose
the
judge
knowingly
keeps
on
an
inept
court
reporter
who's
always
late,
is
having
health
problems,
et
cetera,
and
two
or
three
transcripts
are
delayed
or
lost,
can
the
judge
be
sued?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
not
sure
where
we
left
the
colloquy
with
reference
to
the
state
action.
what
is
your
position?
let
us
assume
that...
that
we
agree
with
you
that
there's
qualified
immunity
and
this
action,
then,
goes
to
state
court.
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
he
calculates
his
damages.
is
there
qualified
immunity
there
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
about
a
contact
suit
for
overpayment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
law
settled
on
this
subject
in
the
state
of
washington?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
find
that
there
is
qualified
immunity,
is
there
anything
left
in
this
case
given
the
ruling
that
he
was...
suffered
no
violation
of
his
due
process
rights,
no
injury?
