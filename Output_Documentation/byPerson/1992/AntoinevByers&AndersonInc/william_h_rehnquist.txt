91-7604,
jeffery
antoine
v.
byers
&
anderson.
ms.
mckeown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
color
of
federal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
should
a
federal
employee,
like
the
respondent
in
this
case,
have
any
sort
of
immunity
granted
by
federal
law
if
it's
a
simple
contract
claim
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
one
could
disagree
with
you
on
that
position
so
far
as
any
claim
based
on
federal
law
against
her,
and
perhaps
any
claim
based...
based
on
a
cognate
state
law.
but
a
simple
contract
claim,
hypothesized
by
justice
stevens,
where
the
defendant
claims
that
he
overpaid
$200
for
a
transcript,
it
strikes
me
that
whether
the
federal
law
ought
to
impose
on
the
state
law
system
in
immunity
is
quite
debatable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
mckeown.
mr.
fite,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
though
you
have
a
bystander's
bill,
don't
you,
authorized
in
some
situations.
a
bystander's
bill
where
they
can't
get
a
transcript
and
where
you
simply
ask
people
who
were
in
court
to
say
what
happened.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
to
think,
mr.
fite,
that
this
sort...
the
particular
kind
of
controversy
you've
described
comes
up
often?
i
mean
the
lawsuit
in
this
case,
for
instance,
doesn't
involve
anything
like
that,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
having
truthfully
reported
something
that
damaged
their
client
or
for
having
inaccurately
reported?
i...
i
mean
i
practiced
law
for
16
years
in
court
before
i
left
the
private
practice,
and
i
can't
remember
a
single
instance
where
there
was
a
great
deal
of
controversy
about
a
transcript.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fite.
mc.
mckeown,
you
have
a
minute
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you...
thank
you,
ms.
mckeown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
