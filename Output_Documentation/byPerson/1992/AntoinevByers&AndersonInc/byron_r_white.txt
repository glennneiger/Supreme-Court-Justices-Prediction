justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
qualified
immunity
would
be
of
much
use
to
a
reporter?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
why?
what
does...
what's
qualified...
how
do
you
overcome...
how
do
you
overcome
qualified
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
reporter
would
have
some
doubt
about
what
his
or
her
duties
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
think...
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
they
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
i
think
they
are.
but
i
wonder
what
good
it
will
do
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
like...
like
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be...
it
would
be
the
odd
circumstance
where
qualified
immunity
would
be...
would
do
much
good.
but
nevertheless,
i
would
think
the
reporters
would
win
an
awful
lot
of
cases
because
of...
you
know,
they
just...
they
just
haven't
broken
the
state
law
or
they
certainly
haven't
stated
a
cause
of
action
for
a
civil
rights
violation.
do
we
know
that
they
would
have
qualified
immunity
under
state
law
for
a
state
negligence
action?
i
mean
our
cases
have
all
involved
constitutional
claims
under
1983,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
federal
court
reporter
getting
sued
just
like
anybody
else,
under...
for
negligence
or
for
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
they
be
absolutely
immune--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
we
granted
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
similarly,
qualified
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
based
on
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
judicial
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
