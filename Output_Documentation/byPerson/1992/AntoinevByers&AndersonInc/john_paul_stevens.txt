justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
help
me
out
on
one
thing
about
this
case?
i'm
a
little
rusty
on
just
how
it
arose
and
all.
this
is
a
suit
brought
in
federal
court
against
a
court
reporter
who
was
involved
in
a
federal
trial,
by
a
defendant
in
a
federal
trial,
so
it's
a
federal
immunity
you're
seeking.
but
is
there
not
also...
was
there
not
also
a
state
lawsuit
for
breach
of
contract
for
not
performing?
now,
are
you
claiming,
or
does
the
other
side
claim
that
there
is...
that
the
federal
law
provides
the
court
reporter
with
immunity
from
a
breach
of
contract
action
under
state
law
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if...
in
other
words,
if
he
overpaid
the
court
reporter,
he
paid
her
a
couple
hundred
dollars
more
than
he
should
have
and
sued
to
get
his
money
back,
she
could
just
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
say
i'm
sorry,
i'm
absolutely
immune?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's...
you
think
that's,
in
effect,
what
was
held
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
thought
your
point,
mr.
fite,
was
that
if
there
are
eight
people
talking
at
once
she
can
hear
them
all,
but
she
doesn't
have
eight
hands.
she
can't
write
everything
down
at
once,
and
therefore
she
has
to
make
a
judgment
about
which
things
of
those
that
she
heard
and
can
remember
she
can
get
on
paper.
i
mean
that
happens
sometimes,
a
court
reporter
with
about
six
lawyers
arguing
at
the
same
time,
they
can't
get
them
all.
and
she
must
make
a
decision
as
among
those,
which
one
she's
going
to
put
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
fite,
isn't
it
true
that
if
the
record
didn't
look
right
and
it
had
a
material
bearing
on
the
outcome
of
the
lawsuit,
you're
not
going
to
sue
the
court
reporter,
you're
going
to
get
the
record
straightened
out
for
your
appeal.
you
have
the...
the
reason
for
getting
the
record
straight
exists
whether
you
can
sue
the
court
reporter
or
not.
if
you
have
a
bollixed
up
record
that
prevents
the
review
from
taking
place,
you
have
a
reason
to
raise
the
issue
and
get
into
the
very
dispute
you're
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
end
up
with
the
best
you
can
get
out
of
the
work
that's
done
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
your
normal
recourse
would
be
to
sue
the
court
reporter.
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
if
there's...
most
of
us
have
had
good
experience
with
court
reporters,
and
if
we
hadn't,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
have
raised
it
as
trying
to
straighten
out
the
record
in
the...
in
the
case.
if
the
witness
answers
yes
and
the
court
reporter
writes
down
no,
you...
you
remember
those
things
if
it's
an
important
question.
