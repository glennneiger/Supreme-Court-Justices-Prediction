ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
a
court
reporter
who
fails
to
produce
a
transcript
is
entitled
to
absolute
judicial
immunity,
thus
overcoming
the
presumption
of
qualified
immunity
which
has
been
found
to
be
sufficient
protection
for
the
vast
majority
of
public
and
government
officials,
ranging
from
presidential
aides
to
the
attorney
general,
other
cabinet
officers,
governors,
police
officers,
and
school
board
members.
we
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit
ruling,
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
bars
mr.
antoine's
suit
simply
because
the
court
reporter
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
judicial
process,
expands
the
immunity
doctrine
beyond
the
court's
decisions
and
certainly
far
beyond
its
historical
scope.
the
case
comes
here
in
a
situation
where
over
3-year
period
the
court
reporter
ignored
numerous
court
orders,
failed
to
file
the
transcript,
and,
in
fact,
violated
show
cause
orders
from
the
ninth
circuit.
finally,
after
3
years,
she
was
unable
to
produce
a
complete
transcript
and
a
substitute
reporter
was
able
to
file
a
reconstructed
transcript
which
was
admittedly
deficient.
we
ask
the
court
to
rule
that
a
court
reporter's
function
is
not
adjudicatory,
it
is
not
a
judicial
function,
and
she
is
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
from
suit
for
damages.
the
circuits
are
split
on
this
issue,
but
the
answer
can
be
found
in
the
court's
cases
on
judicial
immunity.
the
starting
point
in
the
immunity
analysis
is
that
the
presumption
is
that
there
is
qualified
immunity.
so
here
it's
not
a
question
of
absolute
immunity
or
nothing,
but
rather
starting
with
a
presumption
of
qualified
immunity.
and
because
absolute
immunity
must
be
granted
so
sparingly
and
has
generally
been
regarded
as
such
an
extreme
measure,
there
is
a
very
heavy
burden
on
the
respondents
to
justify
elevation
from
qualified
to
absolute
immunity.
no
justification
exists
here.
certainly,
the
court
reporter
doesn't
serve
a
function
so
special
or
so
sensitive
as
to
require
a
total
shield
from
liability.
nor
is
the
real
purpose
of
judicial
immunity,
that
is
preservation
of
independent
decision
making,
preventing
the
chilling
of
making
hard
and
difficult
decisions,
served
in
this
particular
case
because,
of
course,
the
court
reporter
makes
no
such
decisions
and
has
no
such
discretion
to
chill.
i
would
like
to
turn,
then,
to
a
discussion
of
a
judicial
act
and
adjudication.
the
threshold
question--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--yes.
i
believe
that
a
judge
certifying
a
record
for
appellate
review
is
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity.
that
is
a
function
normally
performed
by
the
judge,
and
that
really
is
an
extension...
we're
assuming
a
trial
judge...
of
the
decision-making
process
in
which
the
judge
has
engaged
on
the
trial
level.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
let
me
answer
your
first
question,
and
that
is
whether
this
judge's
certification
might
be
deemed
to
be
ministerial.
and
it
might;
there
is
not
an
absolute
line
that
can
always
be
drawn.
but
certainly
in
the
case
of
a
judge,
one
needs
to
look
to
the
scope
of
judge's
authority,
and
it's
a
fairly
broad
decision-making
authority,
in
contrast
to
the
very
limited
authority
of
the
court
reporter.
taking
your
second
situation,
and
that
is
assume
that
the
judge
makes
notes
during
the
process
and
those
are
used
in
some
fashion
on
appeal,
it
would
appear
that
those
notes
would
be
made
as
part
of
the
decision-making
process,
not
as
a
part
of
recording
simply
a
verbatim
transcript
of
what
went
on
in
the
courtroom.
so
there's
a
far
bigger
distinction
there
between
the
note
taking
by
the
judge,
which
might
be
akin
to
historical
note
taking
by
the
judge
in
which
he
had
absolute
immunity
and
was
taking
notes
so
that
he
could
comment
on
the
evidence
and
summarize
matters
for
the
jury.
but
surely
a
court
reporter
is
not
taking
notes
as
a
part
of
the
decision-making
process,
but
rather
simply
pursuant
to
statute
and
court
order.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
in
that
particular
situation,
that
would
come
somewhat
close
to
forrester,
of
a
hiring
and
firing
decision
which
may
be
an
administrative
act
rather
than
a
judicial
act
by
the
judge.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
but
in
any
event,
there
would
be
qualified
immunity.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
yes.
in
any
event,
there
would
be
qualified
immunity
in
that
case,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
decision,
albeit
not
an
adjudicative
one,
would
not
be
subject
to
suit
because
there
was
qualified
immunity.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
if
it's
determined
that
the
judge's
conduct
was
adjudicative
in
nature,
then
there
would
be
absolute
immunity
and
you
would
not
reach
the
respondeat
superior.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
as
to
whether
the
judge
would
be
liable
in
negligence,
most
likely
if
the
judge
is
given
qualified
immunity,
then
the
judge's,
in
effect,
good
faith
and
following
his
own
procedures
would
exempt
him
from
liability.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
if
there
is
not
a...
sufficient
evidence
to
meet
the
qualified
immunity
test,
it
may
also
be
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
because,
generally,
civil
rights
claims
based
solely
on
negligence
would
not
rise
to
the
level
of
stating
a
claim
under
bivens
or
section
1983.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
there
would
be
a
state
law...
there
would
be
a
potential
negligence
claim
under
state
law.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
would
qualified
immunity
be
of
use
to
a
reporter?
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
as
a
practical
matter,
yes,
because--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--from
the
cases
that
have
been
brought
against--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--well,
there's...
there's
various
cases
which
have
been
brought
where
the
court
reporters
have
been
granted
qualified
immunity.
for
example,
simply
following
the
judge's
instructions.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
well,
i
think
it
would
do
them
good
because
there
are
circumstances
in
which
i
believe
they
would
meet
the
qualified
immunity
test.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
a
good
example
would
be
where
the
judge,
perhaps
as
part
of
his
decision-making
process,
has
a
vendetta
against
a
particular
litigant,
but
gives
the
court
reporter
an
order,
for
example,
don't
produce
the
transcript
for
6
months.
there
it
would
appear
the
court
reporter,
following
the
duties
that
is
given
to
her
by
the
judge,
would
be
able
to
avail
herself
of
qualified
immunity.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
that's
correct.
there...
there
are--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--well,
it
would
appear
under
the
westfall
decision
that
the
immunity
analysis
should
end
up
the
same
whether
a
federal
cause
of
action
or
a
state
cause
of
action,
certainly
against
a
federal
official.
there
are
some
circumstances
where
states
have
their
own
immunity
statutes,
and
in
some
of
those
they
even
implicate
court
reporters,
for
example,
and
they
do
have
immunity
under
their
state
law
provisions.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
if
it's
a
state
court
reporter
being
sued.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
i
think
that--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--if--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--that's
correct.
if
you
granted--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--that's
correct.
and...
and
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
what
would
be
the
test
if
you
had
the
federal
reporter
but
sued
under
state
law,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
courts
would
fashion
a
test
which
would
be
similar
to
the
constitutional-type
test,
that
is
whether
she
was
following
out
her
duties
and
was
able
to
proceed
in
an
expeditious
and
appropriate
fashion
under
either
the
statute
or
rule.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
well,
under
the...
this
court's
rulings,
the
federal
prosecutor,
acting
in
a
prosecutorial
capacity,
has
absolute
immunity.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
no,
that
is...
that
is
based
on
common
law,
as
well
as
looking
at
the--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--judicial
immunity
is
based
essentially
on
the
common
law
rather
than
statute
or
constitution.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
and
that
is
essentially
extended
with
respect
to
the
prosecutor.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
because
the
prosecutor
plays
that
role.
and
that
is
exactly...
that
prosecutorial
issue
really
frames
why
judicial
immunity
has
been
granted,
because
the
purpose
there
is
to
protect
the
independent
decision
making,
it
is
to
protect
the
actual
adjudicative
process.
so
the
prosecutor,
like
witnesses
or
jurors,
acts
in
an
equivalent
role
to
the
judge
in
considering,
weighing,
and
making
presentations
in
evidence.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
your
recitation
of
the
facts
is
exactly
the
procedure
in
which
the
case
was
brought.
the
case
was
brought
pro
se
by
mr.
antoine.
he
had
both
what
he
called
a
1983
claim,
which
was
really
a
bivens'
claim--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--and
a
state
contract
claim.
the...
as
i
understand
the
respondents'
position,
it
was
that
absolute
immunity
would
bar
either
of
those
cases.
but
the
court
below,
having
decided
that
absolute
immunity
would
take
effect,
essentially
dismissed
without
prejudice
his
state
cause...
state
law
cause
of
action.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
we
would
disagree
with
that
position,
of
course.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
yes.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
she's
not
a
federal
employee.
she
is
hired
under
an
emergency
court
reporter
act,
because
the
court
did
not
have
a
full-time
court
reporter
at
the
time.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
that's
correct.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
yes.
she
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
and
in...
pursuant
to--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--federal
law,
excuse
me.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
federal
law
and
pursuant
to
federal
statute
and
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
federal
court.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
the
latter
because
that
issue--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--was
never
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
that's
correct.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
that's
correct.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
i
don't
know
of
cases
where
the
judge
was
sued
for
a
failed...
failure
to
compile
the
record.
there
are
cases
involving
writs
of
capital
punishment
where
the
judge's
notes
were
used
and
needed
in
some
equivalent
to
a
king's
appellate
process,
but
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
the
judge
was
sued
in
that
context.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
the
best
discussion
of
the
judge's
notes
is
found
in
the
articles
by
professor
langbein
at
yale,
and
he
discusses
the
function
of
the
judge
there
as
the
notes
really
being
part
of
the
judge's
decision
making
or
adjudicatory
process.
and
by
way
of
historical--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--he
wrote
two
different
articles
on...
i
believe
they're
cited
in
our
briefs,
and
i
can
reference
them
by
date
if
you'd
like
me
to.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
thank
you.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
no,
that...
that
is
not
the
conclusion
that
professor
langbein
drew.
in
fact,
it's
the
opposite,
it's
that
those
notes
were
taken
during
the
trial
and
then
were
used
in
the
summing
up
process
to
the
jury.
the
other
function
that
those
notes
served
was
when
the
king
would
go
back
to
the
judge
for
a
recommendation
on...
in
a
capital
case,
to
ask
the
judge
to
go
back
and
look
at
his
notes
and
make
a
recommendation
as
to
what
kind
of
sentence
or
a
judgment
ought
to
be
passed.
so
they
were
never
used
in
the
same
function
that
we
know
today.
and,
of
course,
the
notion
of
a
verbatim
transcript
was
not
even
mandatory
in
the
federal
courts
until
1944.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
threshold
question,
when
one
is
looking
at
judicial
immunity,
is
whether
their
conduct
is,
in
fact,
judicial.
and
under
forrester's
functional
approach
that's
determined,
of
course,
by
the
nature
of
the
act,
not
the
title.
so
simply
because
somebody
is
called
court
reporter
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
functioning
as
a
judge
or
in
a
judicial
context.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
there's
qualified
immunity,
we
would
argue
that...
under
westfall,
that
that
same
immunity
applies
to
the
state
law
causes
of
action.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
same.
we
would
argue
again
that
the
qualified
immunity
would
apply,
that
there
would
be
no
absolute
immunity
from
suit.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
well,
there
is
some
suggestion
that
there
would
be
no
immunity
in
such
situations.
and
we
would
be
willing,
of
course,
to
accept
that
rule.
the
concern
is
that
given
the
court
reporter
obviously
having
some
association
with
the
judicial
process,
that
there
may
be
some
reluctance
to
go
that
far.
our
position,
of
course,
ideally
would
be
that
she
has
no
immunity
because
everything
she
does
is
totally
ministerial
and
nonjudicial.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
i
would
agree
with
that.
and
assuming,
of
course,
no
particular
state
statute,
were
this
to
go
back
to
the
state
court,
we
would
argue
no
immunity
with
respect,
certainly,
to
the
contract
action.
but
that
the
only
issue
that
comes
before
this
court,
of
course,
is
this
particular
bivens
federal
claim
and
what
the
immunity
is
with
respect
to
that.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
well,
i
wouldn't
draw
that
distinction.
at
this
point
in
time
i
have
to
be
candid
that
my
client
has
not
himself
alleged
a
state
tort
action
on...
there
is
an
amended
complaint
that
was
pending,
and
the
amendment
was
not
granted
because
the
case
was
dismissed.
in
looking
at
what
is
a
judicial
act,
the
language
in
the
partial
concurrence
in
burns
v.
reed
is
really
quite
helpful,
because
there
it
was
written
that
the
touchstone
of
the
application
of
judicial
immunity
is
the
function
of
resolving
disputes
between
the
parties,
or
that
is
authoritatively
adjudicating
private
rights.
so
if
you
take
the
situation
of
what
does
the
court
reporter
do
and
does
she
fall
into
that
description,
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
the
court
reporter,
of
course,
performs
a
stenographic
function,
produces
a
verbatim
transcript
according
to
very
clear
rules,
and
it's
a
skilled,
but
it's
a
ministerial
function.
the
scope
of
that
activity
is
hardly
in
any
respect
related
to
the
notion
of
why
we
have
judicial
immunity.
the
court
reporter
exercises
no
independent
judgement,
she
performs
none
of
the
classic
adjudicative
functions
such
as
evaluation
of
evidence,
like
the
jury
might
do.
she
has
no
discretion
over
the
rights
of
the
parties
and
she
does
nothing
that
is
really
central
to
this
truth
seeking
which
is
part
of
the
justice
system.
the
central
characteristic,
then,
that
is
adjudication,
is
not
present
with
the
court
reporter.
secondly,
you
ask
is
it
an
act
normally
performed
by
the
judge.
and
clearly
in
the
system
as
we
know
it
now,
that
is
not
part
of
the
judge's
normal
function,
that
is
to
take
a
verbatim
transcript.
nor
could
it
be
said
that
somehow
the
court
reporter
is
the
judge's
alter
ego
or
performs
a
function
which
is
really
comparable
to
a
judge.
i
think
that
certainly
would
be
a
disservice
to
the
judiciary,
to
suggest
that
court
reporting
is
functionally
comparable
to
judging.
and
finally,
of
course,
a
necessary
but
not
determinative
point
is
to
go
back
to
the
historical
analysis.
and
since
there
were
no
court
reporters
at
common
law,
and
on
that
point
i
believe
both
parties
are
in
agreement,
the
question
is
then
asked
was
there
any
comparable
function.
and
the
fact
is
that
there
wasn't.
there
really
was
nothing
like
a
verbatim
record
at
common
law.
the
note
taking
was
for
judicial
summing
up.
and
even
those
court
clerks
who
had
transcripts,
and
that
was
basically
just
a
listing
of
the
pleadings,
were
entitled
to
no
immunity
because
they
were
performing
ministerial
acts
under
the
common
law.
so
with
those
principles
in
mind,
i'd
like
to
turn
then
to
the
ninth
circuit
decision
and
to
suggest
why
that
decision
is
wrong.
essentially,
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
to
grant
absolute
judicial
immunity
to
anything
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
judicial
process.
but
what
that
does,
basically,
is
to
ignore
forrester,
and
it
really
collapses
the
judicial
immunity
analysis
into
an
unprecedented
association
with
the
judiciary.
the
test
ought
not
to
be
where
you
sit
but
what
you
do.
also,
this
would
be
a
blanket
extension
of
the
notion
of
absolute
judicial
immunity
to
the
entire
judicial
branch.
and
as
we've
learned
from
other
cases
such
as
harlow,
such
an
undifferentiated
extension
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
functional
approach.
what
it
would
do,
of
course,
is
to
place
the
judiciary
in
a
situation
superior
to
the
other
two
branches
of
government.
just
as
the
president's
immunity
cannot
be
extended
in
an
undifferentiated
fashion
to
his
aides,
neither
can
the
judiciary's
immunity
be
extended
in
an
undifferentiated
fashion
to
a
court
reporter.
or
similarly,
even
in
the
legislative
context
from
the
gravel
case,
legislative
acts
are
not
all
encompassing.
finally,
what
the
ninth
circuit
also
focused
on
was
that
this
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
overall
administration
of
justice
and
the
efficient
administration
of
justice,
and
therefore
there
ought
to
be
absolute
immunity.
and
we
would
take
issue
with
that
because
that
fails
to
distinguish
acts
that
are
important
to
the
judicial
system
from
judicial
acts.
the
answer
to
that
can
best
be
found
in
the
language
of
forrester
where
the
court,
talking
about
administrative
acts,
says
that
they
might
have
been
quite
important
in
providing
necessary
conditions
of
a
sound
adjudicative
system,
but
the
decisions
at
issue
were
not
themselves
judicial
or
adjudicative.
the
second
prong
of
the
forrester
test
then
asks
to
evaluate
what
impact
would
there
be
were
one
to
grant
qualified
immunity
to
court
reporters,
and
what
impact
would
that
have
on
the
court
reporters'
performance
of
their
duties.
starting
with
a
premise
that
qualified
immunity
is
the
rule,
there's
no
real
reason
to
place
the
court
reporters
in
a
preferred
position
above
all
those
other
officers
mentioned
earlier,
such
as
law
enforcement
officials,
presidential
aides,
who
day
after
day
face
very
difficult,
important
discretionary
decisions,
and
yet
are
protected
only
by
qualified
immunity.
and
also,
the
court
reporter
can
hardly
be
said
to
fit
within
the
short
list
of
those
functions
to
which
this
court
has
granted
absolute
immunity:
the
judge,
in
the
judge's
judicial
or
legislative
capacity;
jurors,
witnesses,
and
prosecutors
taking
part
in
a
deliberative
evidentiary
hearing;
the
president
or
legislators
and
their
aides
acting
as
alter
egos.
at
this
time,
if
the
court
has
no
objection,
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
thank
you.
let
me
address
briefly
the
threat
of
litigation
and
then
the
historical
issue.
on
the
threat
of
litigation,
there
are
four
circuits
which
hold
for
qualified
immunity
and
there
are
also
district
courts
in
three
other
circuits.
the
result
has
not
been
a
flood
of
litigation.
we
disagree
with
opposing
counsel
that
there
is
some
significant
threat,
and
i
would
turn
again
back
to
westfall
where
the
court
noted
that
where
conduct
is
not
the
product
of
independent
threat,
then
the
threat
of
liability
cannot
detrimentally
inhibit
that
function.
turning
to
the
historical
section,
we
are
in
disagreement
that
the
judge's
note
taking
was
in
any
way
comparable
to
what
the
court
reporter
does,
and
refer
to
the
1978
and
1983
articles
of
professor
langbein.
the
appellate
process,
as
we
know
it--
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
--yes.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
at
that
time,
now
moved
to
yale,
as
i
understand.
but
i
believe
a
close
reading
of
his
discussion
would
support
the
position
that
we
have
taken
in
the
brief.
while
i
do
not
know
of
a
case
against
a
judge,
i
can
refer
the
court
to
bates
v.
foree.
ms.
m.
margaret
mckeown
thank
you.
