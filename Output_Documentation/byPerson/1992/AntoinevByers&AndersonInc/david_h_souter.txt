justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
would
be...
is
there
any
potential
judicial
liability
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
reporter
may
be
held
liable?
are
we
talking
about
a
respondeat
superior
here?
because
i
would
suppose...
for
example,
in
justice
kennedy's
case,
i
mean
he's
posing
an
example
in
which
the
judge's
decision
is
a
decision
which
is
made
on
the
administrative
rather
than
the
adjudicative
side
of
the
dichotomy
in
his
duties,
so
that
if
the...
if
the
reporter
is
negligent
and
the
judge
was
negligent
in
keeping
the
reporter
on,
i
assume
there's
going
to
be...
could
there
be
respondeat
superior
negligence
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
wasn't.
i
mean
what
if
the
judge
simply
has
an
incompetent
court
reporter
and
keeps
the
incompetent
court
reporter
on,
and
the
reporter
then
causes
damages?
is
the
judge
going
to
be
liable,
a,
for
his
own
negligence,
or...
and
b,
would
the
judge,
in
any
event,
be
liable
on
a
respondeat
superior
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
if
he
knows
that
he's
got
a
incompetent
there
and
he's...
he's
a
kind
person,
he
doesn't
want
to
fire
this
person,
and
just
keeps
the
incompetent
reporter
on?
he
doesn't
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
law
gives
him
a
privilege
to
inflict
incompetent
reporters
on
the
parties,
so
there's
not
going
to
be
any
good
faith
defense,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
state
law?
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
with
respect
to
the
state
law
contract
action.
did
the...
did
the
court
below
purport...
did
any
federal
court
below
purport
to...
no,
let
me
strike
that.
did
the
court
of
appeals
purport
to
hold
that
there
was
absolute
immunity
with
respect
to
the
state
contract
action,
or
did
the
court
of
appeals,
in
effect,
simply
leave
that
to
be
adjudicated
as
a
matter
of
state
law
if
the
claim
was
brought...
was
refiled
as
a
state
law
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
only
issue
before
us
is
just
bivens
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
the
conclusion
in
those
articles
that
the
notes
themselves
were
actually
shipped
up
to...
either
to
an
appellate
court
or
to
the
court
sitting
in
a
law
term,
if
it
was
an
old
nisi
prius
judge,
so
that
those
notes
actually
functioned
as
the
equivalent
of
today's
verbatim
transcript?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
if
a...
if
a
question
arises
about
the
accuracy
of
the
reporter's
notes,
the
trial
judge
settles
that
and
says
yes,
the
witness
said
yes
rather
than
no
in
answer
to
that
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
historical
question.
i
guess
it's
the
same
one
i
asked
your
opposing
counsel.
do
you
have
any
historical
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
trial
judge's
notes
were
themselves
transferred
either
to
an
appellate
court
or
to
a
panel
of
his
own
court,
if
it
was
a
nisi
prius
judge?
