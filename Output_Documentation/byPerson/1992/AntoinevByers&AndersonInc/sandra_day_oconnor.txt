justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
may
i
interrupt
you?
do
you
suppose
that
a
judge
would
have
absolute
immunity
in
certifying
a
case
record
for
appellate
review,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
you
could
certainly
say
that's
a
ministerial
sort
of
act,
couldn't
you?
what
if
the
trial
judge
kept
notes
during
that
proceedings
that
became
relevant
on
appeal
and
they
had
to
be
sent
up,
do
you
suppose
that's
part
of
the
judicial
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
judicial
immunity
had
a
long
common
law
history.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
don't
have
a
common
law
analogue
for
court
reporters,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
courtroom
marshall
or
bailiff
who
acts
with
excessive
force
in
subduing
some
obstreperous
witness
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
then
why
should
we
concoct
some...
some
absolute
immunity
principle
here?
