justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
said
that
you
must
give
a
reporter,
or
anybody,
any
government
officer,
qualified
immunity
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
what...
what
it's
meant
in
connection
with
the
federal
causes
of
action,
which
are
all
constitutional
causes
of
action,
has
been
simply
that
it
has
to
be,
you
know,
violation
of
a
known
constitutional
right,
intentional
violation
of
a
known
constitutional
right.
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
when
you're
applying
it
in
a
constitutional
context,
but
how
do
you...
how
do
you
translate
that
into
a
state
tort
action
for
negligence
of
a...
of
a
court
reporter,
not
claiming
any
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
just
negligence
causing
me
to
lose
my
appeal?
suppose
we
said
a
court
reporter
has
absolute
immunity
from
suit
and
the
court
reporter...
i
mean
in
a
federal
court.
in
a
federal
court
a
federal
officer
has
absolute
immunity,
and
the
court
reporter
gets
sued
in
a
state
court
under
state
law,
and
absolute
immunity
wouldn't
be
any
use
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
of
course,
we
developed
the
other
test
because
we
thought
it
was
a
fair
interpretation
of
what
congress
intended
in
the
congressional
statute
allowing
suit.
that's
how
we
came
to
that,
and
i
guess
in
bivens'
action
we
just
imitate
that,
but
basically
it
was
based
upon
a
congressional
intent.
and
i
guess
we'd
just
be
making
it
up
for
the...
or
i
don't
know,
some
congressional
common...
some
federal
common
law
principle
that
requires
this
to
be
applied
in
state
causes
of
action.
i
don't
know.
it's
just
a
new
question
to
me.
well,
you...
we've
announced
that
a
federal...
certain
federal
officers,
wholly
aside
from
any
statute
are...
have
either
absolute
or
qualified
immunity.
how
about
the
prosecutor,
federal
prosecutor?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
she
a
federal
employee?
i
thought...
i
thought
she
was
independent
contractor.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
she
was
an
independent
contractor.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
bivens
applies
to
independent
contractors
hired
by
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mckeown,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
from
the
days
when
judges
just
to
keep
their
own...
used
to
keep
the
record,
used
to
compile
the
record?
do
you
know
of
any
cases
in
which
a
judge
was...
was
sued
for
failure
to
compile
the
record
properly?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
did
he
write
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
right.
never...
don't
take
the
time
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
tort
action.
you
don't
assert
that
there's
no
qualified
immunity,
whatever
that
means,
with
respect
to
a
state
tort
action.
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
state
tort
action
and
a
state
contract
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
how
we
decide
this
case,
whatever
we
think
is
better?
you
know,
i
don't
know.
i
mean
certainly
in
the
1983
cases
we
purported
to
be
deciding
whether
the
immunity
existed
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
existed
at
common
law
at
the
time
1983
was
adopted.
and
we've
sort
of
carried
the
same
immunities
we
find
in
1983
over
into
bivens,
which
we
sort
of
created
out
of
1983.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
your
criteria,
that
whatever
is
better
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
purposes
to
absolute
immunity.
one
is
simply
to
restrict
what
otherwise
would
be
frequent
lawsuits,
so
that
the
judge
or
whoever
it
is
won't
have
to
be
in
court
all
the
time
defending
his
or
her
actions.
and
the
second
is
to
be
sure
that
in
order
to
avoid
lawsuits,
the
judge
or
whoever
it
is
does
not...
does
not
shrink
from
making
the
tough
calls,
the
tough
decisions,
the
jury
from
calling
it
the
way
the
jury
really
saw
it,
or
the
judge
from
coming
out
against
somebody
who
is
a...
an
habitual
litigant
and
would
sue
anybody
in
sight.
i
don't
see
how
the
second
of
these
reasons,
at
least,
applies
to
the
court
reporter.
the
first
may,
but
maybe...
maybe
qualified
immunity
is
enough
to
take
care
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
decision
would
she
likely
shrink
from
taking,
knowing
that
she
would
be
subject
to
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
think
it's
a
matter
of
judgment
whether
you
hear
yes
or
no.
i
mean
that's
not
a
matter
of
judgment.
i
mean
anybody
can
be
intimidated
into
lying.
you
can't
prevent
that
by
absolute
immunity
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
judgment...
what
judgmental
calls
does
she
have
to
make
that
might
be
swayed?
justice
antonin
scalia
any?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me...
give
me...
okay,
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
that's
just
a
matter
of
being
able
not
to
hear
everything
at
once.
but
if
she
heard
everything
at
once,
surely
she
should
put
it
all
down.
if
there
were
eight
people
that
spoke
at
once
and
she
could
hear
all
eight,
she'd
have
to
write
it
down,
wouldn't
she?
okay,
so
that's...
i
don't
consider
that
judgment.
i
consider
that
just
a
matter
of
hearing
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
give
me...
i
can't
think
of
one
example
of
judgment,
where
she
has
to
make
a
judgment
that
could
be
influenced
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fite,
i
was
under
the
impression
when
we
took
this
case
that
there
was
a
conflict
below,
that
at
least
some
jurisdictions
have
made
it
clear
that
you
can
sue
a
court
reporter.
and
has
the
experience...
am
i
right
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
have
they...
have
they
been
flooded
with
litigation
against
court
reporters,
those
jurisdictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
raised
it,
i
didn't,
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
aware
that
people
wait
for
us
to
speak
before
they
file
lawsuits
if
they
think
they're
going
to
win
in
their
state
or
in
their...
in
their
circuit.
i
think
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
litigation
in
those
circuits
that
have
held
contrary
to
your
view
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
professor
langbein
of
chicago.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
that
time.
