mr.
richard
b.
robinson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
operation
of
a
formula
that
was
created
by
congress
for
determining
how
much
of
a
taxpayer's
depletion
deduction
would
be
subject
to
the
minimum
tax.
in
section
57(a)(8),
congress
stated
that
taxpayers
would
be
subject
to
a
minimum
tax
for
their
depletion
only
to
the
extent
that
their
depletion
deduction
for
each
mineral
deposit
exceeds
the
adjusted
basis
they
have
in
that
property.
the
specific
question
at
issue
here
is
whether
certain
depreciable
improvements
to
the
taxpayer's
mineral
deposit
can
be
included
in
the
calculation
of
adjusted
basis.
now,
the
tax
law
recognizes
two
kinds
of
improvements
to
an
oil
and
gas
property,
and
that
is
the
specific
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
the
improvements
to
an
oil
and
gas
property
can
be
included
in
adjusted
basis.
these
are
intangible
improvements
and
tangible
improvements.
both
kind
of
improvements
improve
the
mineral
deposit
itself,
the
oil
and
gas,
because
they
allow
it
to
be
produced.
intangible
improvements
are
the
costs
incurred
in
drilling
the
well
and
preparing
the
well
for
production.
a
taxpayer
has
the
election
for
these
improvements
to
either
capitalize
them
or
to
expense
them.
if
they
elect
to
capitalize
them,
then
those
intangible
costs
that
are
associated
with
physical
property
are
recoverable
through
the
depreciation
deduction,
but
those
intangible
costs
that
are
not
represented
by
physical
property
are
recovered
through
the
depletion
deduction.
the
government
would
agree
that
those
intangible
improvements
which
are
recoverable
through
depreciation
would
be
included
in
the
adjusted
basis
for
this
calculation.
the
second
kind
of
improvements
are
tangible
improvements,
and
those
are
the
improvements
that
are
at
issue
in
our
case.
the
tangible
improvements
are
those
physical
improvements
that
are
connected
to
the
oil
and
gas
deposit
in
order
to
produce
it.
those
are
the
improvements
that
are
used
to
lift
the
oil
and
gas
out
of
the
ground
and
bring
it
to
the
surface.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
your
honor,
i
think
they
both
help
in
terms
of
producing
them,
but
yes,
they
are
distinguished
from
drilling
the
well
in
the
first
place.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
drilling
the
well
is
an
intangible
cost.
that's
exactly
right.
without
the
cost
of
these
tangible
improvements,
there
could
be
no
production,
and
if
there
is
no
production
from
the
well,
there
can
be
no
depletion
deduction.
so
these
tangibles
are
a
cost
associated
with
obtaining
the
depletion
deduction
itself.
now,
the
government
contends
in
this
case
that
the
code
draws
a
clear
barrier
between
the
depreciation
deduction
and
the
depletion
deduction.
and
i
might
add
in
response
to
an
earlier
question
that
the
taxpayer
is
not
claiming
both
depletion
and
depreciation
with
respect
to
these
costs.
the
tangible
improvements
are
only
being
recovered
through
depreciation.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
your
honor,
we
are
depreciating
the
tangible
improvements
to
the
mineral
deposit.
i
might
add--
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
--a
depreciation
deduction
for
the
tangible
improvements.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
we
are
not
including
it
for
purposes
of
figuring
our
depletion.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
we're
depreciating
the
casing
that
goes
down
into
the
well,
the
pump
that
brings
the
oil
and
gas
to
the
surface.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
no,
we're
not.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
we
couldn't.
that
was
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
those
are...
we
couldn't
be
able
to
pull
the
oil
up
from
the
ground.
and
if
you
recall,
there
is
no
depletion
deduction
that
can
be
obtained
unless
there
is
production
from
the
property.
so
these
are
a
cost
you
must
incur
in
order
to
obtain
the
depletion
deduction.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
not
for
depletion,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
any
costs
that
are
represented
by
physical
property
have
to
be
recovered
through
depreciation.
you
can't
recover
those
costs
of
physical
property
through
depletion.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
it
is
the
casing,
the
pipes,
and
the
pumps
that
are
lifting
the
oil
and
gas
out
of
the
ground.
we
were
including
those
costs
in
the
calculation
of
our
adjusted
basis.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
the
amount
goes
down
each
year
as
we
claim
a
depreciation
deduction
on
those
items.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
once
we've...
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
once
we've
recovered
all
the
costs
of
these
depreciable
improvements,
then
each
year,
as
we're
claiming
depreciation,
the
amount
of
the
minimum
tax...
subject
to
the
minimum
tax
goes
up.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
no,
not
the
cost
of
drilling
the
well,
your
honor.
in
the
record,
if
you
look
in
the
record
at...
that
was
filed
with
the
federal
circuit
at
page
850
and
868,
we
listed
through
a
stipulation
with
the
government
what
those
expenses
were,
and
they
are
the
pipes,
the
pumps,
and
the
equipment
that
is
used
to
lift
it.
when
you're
drilling
an
oil
and
gas
well,
the
costs
of
drilling,
the
wages,
the
fuel,
those
are
intangible
costs.
that's
the
costs
of
actually
putting
the
hole
in
the
ground
that
are
not
represented
by
physical
property.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
those
are
treated
as
intangible
costs
as
compared
to
tangible,
and
you
have
the
option
of
either--
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
--of
capitalizing
or
expensing
them.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
no.
i'm
treating
that
the
same.
anything
represented
by
physical
property
falls
within
the
category
of
tangibles.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
there's
two
bases,
your
honor.
number
one
is
the
intangibles
have
to
do
with
drilling
the
well.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
in
the
regulations
under
section
612,
which
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
they're
described
for
you
over
on
page
18,
and
they
were
cited
in
the
discussion
of
the
opinion
of
the
lower
courts
over
on
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition
for
their
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
appendix
on
page
5a.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
it's
section
612-4(a),
(b),
and
(c),
which
goes
through
the
discussion
of
what
is
tangible
and
what
is
a
non...
intangible
expense.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
the
regulations
describe
the
disparate
treatment
for
them,
and
it's
based...
it
is
based
on--
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
--section
612-4.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
yes,
and
that
is
derived,
your
honor,
from
code
section
263(c)
which
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
issue
regulations
describing
the
election
to
expense
or
capitalize
intangible
costs.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
in
our
brief,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
--yes.
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
appendix
5a,
the
opinion
discusses
section
612
and--
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
--no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
i
have
set
out
portions,
but
i
did
not
set
out
the
text,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
i
apologize,
your
honor.
the
government's
principal
objection
to
the
lower
court's
opinion...
or
criticism
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
that
the
code
draws
separate
treatment...
draws
a
line
between
the
treatment
of
the
depletion
deduction
and
the
treatment
of
the
depreciation
deduction,
and
that
the
lower
court's
opinion
improperly
crosses
that
line.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
government
is
not
accurately
reflecting
the
lower
court's
opinion.
the
lower
courts
recognized
the
difference
between
the
depletion
deduction
and
the
depreciation
deduction,
but
the
lower
courts
said
that
the
issue
in
this
case
does
not
involve
the
calculation
of
the
depletion
deduction.
this
case
involves
the
calculation
under
a
formula
of
how
much
depletion
is
subject
to
the
minimum
tax,
and
code
section
57(a)(8)
tells
us
that
we
make
that
determination
by
reference
to
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
statutory
language
between
section
57(a)(8)
and
section
612
in
that
section
57(a)(8)
does
not
contain
any
possibility
of
an
exception
or
a
special
meaning
for
the
rule
of
adjusted
basis,
whereas
section
612
talks
about
except
as
otherwise
provided.
in
the
section
612
regs,
your
honor...
and
they
are
reprinted
on
page
14
of
our
brief...
those
regulations
make
it
clear
that
there
are
two
separate
rules
at
issue
here
and
that
the
government
is
focusing
on
the
rules
for
calculating
the
depletion
deduction;
whereas
section
57
and
the
regulations
focus
on
the
rules
for
calculating
adjusted
basis.
the
title
of
these
regulations
is
basis
for
cost
depletion,
and
if
you
look
at
section
612-1(a)
of
those
regulations,
they
tell
you
that
the
basis
upon
which
the
cost
depletion
deduction
is
to
be
calculated
is
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property
as
provided
in
section
1011
for
purposes
of
determining
gain
or
loss
except
as
otherwise
provided.
so
they
tell
you
that
there
is
a
rule
for
calculating
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property
for
determining
gain
or
loss.
and
then
there
is
this
special
rule
provided
in
calculating
the
adjusted
basis
for
calculating
cost
depletion,
and
that
special
rule
is
set
forth
under
paragraph
(b).
paragraph
(b)
says
that
the
basis
for
cost
depletion
excludes
the
cost
of
depreciable
improvements
to
the
property,
amounts
recoverable
through
the
depreciation
deduction.
as
the
lower
courts
recognized,
the
difference
in
the
language
between
the
section
57
regulations
and
the
section
612
regulations
is
very
significant.
the
fact
that
the
section
612
regulations
had
to
have
what
is
labeled
a
special
rule
to
exclude
the
cost
of
depreciable
improvements
from
the
calculation
evidences
that
absent
that
special
rule,
the
normal
rules
of
calculating
adjusted
basis
would
apply.
and
the
lower
courts
felt
that
if
congress
or
the
treasury
had
wanted
that
special
rule
to
apply,
because
that
special
rule
under
the
regulations
had
been
outstanding
for
at
least
10
years
at
the
time
that
section
57(a)(8)
was
adopted
and
the
57
regulations
drafted,
then
there
was
a
way
for
them
to
achieve
that
result,
but
that
they
didn't
adopt
that
special
rule.
and
what
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to,
in
effect,
redraft
the
section
57
regulations
so
that
they
would
read
the
same
as
under
the
section
612
regulations.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
in
terms
of
calculating
the
depletion
deduction,
you're
right,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
because,
your
honor,
i
believe
there's
a
difference
between
the
rules
for
calculating
adjusted
basis
for
property
on
the
sale
of
the
property
and
the
rules
for
calculating
the
depletion
deduction.
adjusted
basis
is
an
aggregate
concept.
if
you
would
turn
back
to
our
discussion
on
page
2
of
the
regulations
under
section
1016,
section
1016-2(a)
of
the
regulations,
which
discuss
the
rules
for
calculating
the
adjusted
basis
of
property,
it
makes
it
clear
that
this
is
an
aggregate
concept.
what
we're
trying
to
identify
in
the
calculation
of
adjusted
basis
is
all
the
capital
outlays
that
are
associated
with
the
property
that
are
taken
into
account
in
connection
with
computing
the
gain
or
loss
on
the
sale
of
that
property.
and
these
regulations
very
specifically
tell
us
that
adjusted
basis
includes
the
cost
of
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
the
property.
there's
no
qualification
on
the
kind
of
improvements
or
betterments
that
are
added
to
adjusted
basis.
they
use
the
word
including
without
any
qualification.
so,
for
example--
mr.
richard
b.
robinson
--no,
i
don't
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
the
property
is
the
taxpayer's
interest
in
the
mineral
deposit
that's
identified
in
section
614,
but
the
issue
is
not
what
the
cost
of
that
property
is,
because
section
57(a)(8)
tells
us
that
we
have
to
compute
the
adjusted
basis
of
that
property
in
order
to
determine
the
tax
preference
item
for
depletion.
and
in
computing
adjusted
basis,
we
have
to
take
into
account
a
variety
of
costs
associated
with
the
property.
for
example,
if
we
had
a
building
and
we
installed
a
new
furnace
into
that
building,
that
new
furnace
would
be
an
improvement
to
the
building.
and
when
we
went
to
sell
the
building,
we
would
include
the
unrecovered
cost
of
that
furnace
in
our
calculation
of
adjusted
basis
in
computing
the
gain
or
loss.
now,
that
furnace
might
be
subject
to...
we
may
have
already
depreciated
down
the
building.
it
might
be
subject
to
another
cost
recovery
method.
or,
for
example,
if
we
had
a
parcel
of
land
and
we
installed
a
fence
on
that
land,
that
fence
would
be
an
improvement
to
the
land.
and
we
went
to
sell
it,
we
would
include
the
cost
of
that
fence
even
though
in
that
case
the
land
would
not
be
subject
to
depreciation,
but
the
fence
would
be.
so,
by
focusing
under
the
section
57
regulations
on
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
fundamentally
different
concept,
and
that
explains
why
there
has
to
be
a
special
rule
under
the
section
612
regulations
because
a
variety
of
items
that
may
not
be
subject
to
the
depletion
deduction,
such
as
tangibles
whose
costs
are
recovered
through
depreciation,
have
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
calculation
in
order
to
compute
the
amount
of
cost
depletion
since
those
amounts
aren't...
those
costs
are
not
recoverable
through
the
depreciation...
the
depletion
deduction.
now,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
in
the
discussion,
the
section
57
regulations
are
very
significant
on
this
point
because
these
regulations
do
not
contain
any
reference
to
a
special
rule.
their
cross-reference
is
directly
to
the
general
rule
for
calculating
adjusted
basis
under
this
regulation
at
1016-2(a),
and
as
a
consequence,
we
should
be
entitled
to
take
those
improvements
into
the
calculation
in
computing
adjusted
basis.
i
have
nothing
else,
your
honor,
unless
you
have
any
further
questions.
