justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
why
it
is
that
the
regulations
under
section
57
direct
you
to
go
to
irsc
1016
and
its
regulations
to
determine
the
adjusted
basis?
i
would
have
thought
they
would
have
told
you
to
go
to
irsc
612
and
the
special
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statutory
text?
57(a)
refers
to
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
you
stated
the
case,
you
described
it
as
adjusted
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit.
you
were
very
careful
to
focus
on
mineral
deposit.
what
is
it
that
makes
the
word
property
mean
mineral
deposit
within
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's...
section
614
is
the
one
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
regulations
under
section
57
had
directed
you
to
612
instead
of
to
1016,
would
you
have
been
able
to
make
the
same
argument
that
you're
making
here?
