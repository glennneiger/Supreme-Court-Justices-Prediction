but
you
wouldn't
care
even
if
they
weren't
depleting
them.
even
if
they
weren't
depreciating
them,
you
would
say
that
they
still...
i
mean,
that's
how
they
have
to
be
treated.
justice
antonin
scalia
depreciated
rather
than
depleted.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
all
these
sections
set
forth?
i've
been
looking
through
your
briefs.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ones
you're
relying
on.
1016.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
in
the
united
states
code.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
nice
if
they
were
in
the
briefs
somewhere.
your
statute
involved...
you
don't
even
set
out
1016.
justice
antonin
scalia
--thank
you.
of
course,
your
reply
brief
refers
to
them
as
improvements
to
a
mineral
enterprise.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
you
shift
terminology?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
you
did
make
that
point
in
your
reply
brief,
but
the
reason
i
said
it
seemed
to
me
you
shifted
is,
as
you
framed
the
question
presented,
whether
the
unrecovered
costs
of
depreciable
tangible
improvements
to
a
mineral
deposit
may
properly
be
included
in
the
adjustable
basis.
that's
not
what
you're
saying
now.
these
are
not
improvements
to
the
mineral
deposit.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
enterprise.
so,
the
question
presented,
were
we
to
follow
that,
would
mislead
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
raised
it.
i
didn't.
i
mean,
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
make
a
big
point
of
it
in
your
reply
brief.
all
i'm
saying
is
i
wish
you
had
made
the
same
point
in
your
question
presented.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
is
it
your
position
that
the
provision
of
the
regulations,
612-1(b)(1)(i),
which
says
that
the
basis
for
cost
depletion
of
mineral
property
does
not
include
amounts
recoverable
through
depreciation
deductions...
that's
superfluous
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
achieve?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
would
be
the
case
even
if
that
regulation
didn't
exist.
you
mean
that
regulation
is
simply
observing
what
the...
what
the
effect
of
the
law
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
would
have...
would
have
produced
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
the
advantage
over
us.
you
have
the
text
right
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
amount
changes
every
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction
between
tangibles
and
intangibles?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
understand
what
they
have
to
do
with...
what
text
justifies
depreciating
only
tangibles
and
not
depreciating,
as
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
regulation
number?
i
have
my
own--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'm
not
worried
about
identifying
them.
i'm
worried
about
what
entitles
them
to
disparate
treatment.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
regulation
in
particular?
justice
antonin
scalia
dash
4.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
robinson,
you
say...
to
be
sure
it
is
entitled
special
rule,
special
rule,
but
i
think
what
the
issue
comes
down
to
is
whether
it
is
a
disposition
that
would
not
occur
but
for
the
fact
that
it's
recited
in
the
regulation,
or
whether
it
is,
as
mr.
jones
suggests,
simply
an
acknowledgement
of
what
the
law
would
otherwise
provide.
and
that...
the
regulation
you're
referring...
you're
referring
to,
612-1(b),
in
addition
to
saying
that,
what
you
have
just
discussed,
also
says,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
any
mineral
property,
the
basis
for
cost
depletion
does
not
include
amounts
representing
the
cost
or
value
of
land
for
purposes
other
than
mineral
production.
i
tend
to
think
that
would
have
been
the
case
even
if
it
weren't
set
forth
there,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that...
is
that
(b)...
is
that
612-1(b)
includes
some
dispositions
that
are
just
a
recitation
of
what
the
law
would
be
even
without
any
specification.
if
you
acknowledge
that
that
sentence
is
simply
reciting
what
is
obvious
from
other
provisions
of
the
code,
why
can't
i
say
that
(b)(i)
is
meant
to
do
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
property.
i
mean,
that's
the
essential
dispute
between
you
and
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
you
describe
the
minimum
tax
and
the
adjustments
as
much
more
rational
creatures
than
it
seems
to
me
they
are.
i
mean,
if
you
were
going
to
say
there's
a
hole,
you
would
just
say,
well,
so
there's
a
hole.
congress
left
a
hole.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
regard
the
whole
depletion
allowance
as
a
hole.
it's
a
great
big
hole,
and
congress
wanted
the
hole.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
not
eliminate
the
depletion
allowance.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
question
is
how
much
of
the
depletion
allowance
they
chose
to
leave
in
effect.
that's
all
we're
arguing
about.
