in
that
event,
i
suppose
the
improvements
or
the
tangible
assets
that
you
think
are
depreciable
wouldn't
be...
there
wouldn't
be
a
depreciation
allowance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
the
depreciable
assets
would
be
included
in
the
depletion
base.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
wouldn't
be
depreciated
also,
would
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
what...
the
company
is
both
depleting...
both
including
the
basis
of
the...
these
tangible
assets
in
their
depletion
base
and
also
depreciating
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
recovering
the
cost
of
them
twice.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
depreciating
any
tangible
property
in
connection
with
this
mineral
enterprise?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
taking
a
depreciation
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
including
that
for
purposes
of
figuring
your
depletion.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
kind
of...
what
kind
of
property
are
you
depreciating?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
not
including
that
in
your...
figuring
your
depletion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
without
those
properties,
you
wouldn't
have
much
of
an
oil
well
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
you
were...
the
casing...
are
you
including
that
in
your...
your
basis
for
the
depletion?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it's
absolutely
essential
for...
to
get
the
oil
out
of
the
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
tell
me
again.
what
properties
then
are
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
taxpayer
here
is
not
including
the
value
of
these
depreciable
properties
in
figuring
the
depletion
allowance.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
they're
just...
it's
just
for
figuring
the
tax,
the...
this
extra
tax.
