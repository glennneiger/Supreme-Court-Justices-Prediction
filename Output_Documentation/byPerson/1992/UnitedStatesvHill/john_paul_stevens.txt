--it's
those
costs
to
the
extent
they
have
not
been
depreciated.

which
means
that
the
minimum
tax,
or
whatever
they
call
the
tax,
goes
up
every
year.

until
you
go
down

on
your
basis.

of
course,
that
case
didn't
deal
with
the
tax
on
the
depletion
allowance.
i
mean,
that's
just
distinguishing
depreciation
from
depletion.
it
doesn't
involve
the
second
step
that
we
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
they
just
achieve
that
exemption
by
investing
more
and
more
on
their
properties?
isn't
there
sometimes
an
incentive
to
do
that?
basically
you're
talking
about
unrecovered
investment
in
these
properties
that
presumably
will
produce
more
oil
and
gas
over
the
long
run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
the
basic
reason
for
giving
it
a
depletion
allowance
in
the
first
place
is
inconsistent
with
the
taxpayer's
position
in
this
case.
