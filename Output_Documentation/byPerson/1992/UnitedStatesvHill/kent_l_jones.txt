mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
which
affects
billions
of
dollars
of
revenues
under
the
minimum
tax
is
ultimately
a
quite
narrow
one:
what
costs
are
properly
included
in
the
adjusted
basis
of
a
depletable
mineral
deposit?
while
the
question
is
a
narrow
one,
its
background
is
somewhat
complex.
since
1926
the
tax
treatment
of
mineral
deposits
has
created
a
sizable
incentive
or
tax
preference
for
mining
activities.
the
mineral
depletion
allowance
for
mineral
deposits
differs
dramatically
from
the
ordinary
depreciation
of
other
types
of
wasting
assets.
percentage
depletion
exempts
from
tax
a
portion
of
the
total
income
derived
from
the
mineral
deposit.
the
allowance
continues
so
long
as
production
continues,
even
long
after
the
total
costs
of
the
mineral
deposit
have
been
fully
recovered.
by
1969
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
and
other
tax
preferences
had
been
abused
to
such
an
extent
that
many
wealthy
taxpayers
were
able
to
shield
their
entire
incomes
from
federal
tax.
congress
enacted
the
minimum
tax
to
avoid
this
inequity
and
to
improve
the
fairness
of
the
tax
system
as
a
whole.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
first
version
of
the
minimum
tax
was
enacted
in
1969.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
under
section
1915
of
the
energy
policy
act
of
1992,
which
was
enacted
2
weeks
ago,
congress
has
exempted
the
restricted
minimum...
i'm
sorry...
percentage
depletion
allowance
for
independent
oil
producers
from
the
coverage
of
the
minimum
tax.
congress
left
in
place
the
application
of
the
minimum
tax
to
all
other
types
of
percentage
depletion
allowances.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
actually
what
we
think
and
what
i
believe
the
statute
reflects
is
that
there
are
two
ways
to
attack
abusive
tax
preferences.
one
is
to
tax
them,
which
is
the
way
the
minimum
tax
works.
the
other
is
to
restrict
the
availability
of
the
preference.
what
congress
has
done
since
1969
for
oil
and
gas
depletion
alone
is
to
create
a
statute,
613(a),
which
very
narrowly
restricts
the
availability
of
the
depletion
allowance
for
that
one
industry.
since
1969
congress
has
cut
the
depletion
rate
applicable
to
oil
production
in
half,
from
27
to
15
percent.
they
have
removed
the
availability
of
oil
and
gas
depletion
for
all
integrated
refining
and
marketing
companies,
which
are
the
major
producers
of
oil
in
this
country.
they
have
also
restricted,
even
for
independent
producers,
the
amount
of
depletion
from
an
unlimited
quantity,
first
to
2,000
barrels
a
day
and
now
to
1,000
barrels
a
day.
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
in
section
613(a)(d),
congress
has
provided
that
the
oil
and
gas
depletion
allowance
cannot
be
used
to
exempt
more
than
65
percent
of
the
total
income
of
the
taxpayer,
and
so
in
that
manner,
congress
has
avoided
the
spectacle
of
the
depletion
allowance
being
used
to
exempt
all
of
the
taxpayer's
income,
which
is
the
function
of
the
minimum
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
address
it
in
the
sense
that
all
that
regulation
does
is
refer
the
reader
to
section
1016
of
the
code
for
adjustments
to
basis.
every
one
of
the
depletion
regulations
has
the
same
cross-reference,
and
the
significance
of
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
there's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there's
at
least
two
reasons
why
that
regulation
has
no
relevance
to
the
court's
decision
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
reference
to
1016...
if
you
look
at
1016(a)(2),
it
says
you
shall
make
downward
adjustments
to
basis
for
depletion
allowances.
that
is
the
reason
that
57
and
the
regs
under
61,
612
itself,
all
refer
to
1016.
these...
under
1016(a)(2),
the
adjusted
basis
of
a
mineral
deposit
is
adjusted
downward
each
year.
the
other
and
perhaps
more
important
reason
why
1016
has
no
ultimate
relevance
to
this
case
is
because
the
court
simply
misunderstood
what
the...
how
that
statute
works,
and
if
you
like,
i
can
address
it
now
or
i
can
come
to
it
in
the
course
of
the
discussion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
put
it
into
the
context
of
the
overall
discussion
in
this
case.
section
57
recognizes
that
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
is
a
tax
preference
only
to
the
extent
that
the
allowance
exceeds
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
the
apparently
elementary
one
of
how
the
adjusted
basis
of
a
mineral
deposit
is
determined.
does
it,
as
we
contend,
include
only
the
intangible
costs
of
acquiring
and
developing
the
deposit,
or
as
the
courts
below
concluded,
does
it
also
include
the
costs
of
depreciable
physical
property
used
in
connection
with
production?
in
our
view,
which
all
of
the
commentators
have
agreed
with,
the
answer
is
clearly
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
regulations
and
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
as
well
as
in
the
history
of
the
minimum
tax.
under
section
611
of
the
code,
the
costs
of
the
mineral
deposit
are
to
be
recovered
by
depletion,
and
the
costs
of
physical
improvements
are
to
be
recovered
by
depreciation.
since
separate-methods
are
employed
to
recover
these
different
types
of
costs,
the
regulations
specifically
require
that
the
basis
of
the
depletable
minerals
be
maintained
separately
from
the
basis
of
the
depreciable
improvements.
the
regulations
state
that
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit
does
not
include
amounts
recoverable
through
depreciation
deductions.
this
is
what
justice
o'connor
was
referring
to
as
perhaps
the
special
rule.
but
if
you
look
at
section
1.611-2(b)(2)
of
the
regulations,
you'll
see
that
it
is
not
a
special
rule
that
applies
only
to
cost
depletion
because
the
regulation
says
in
no
event
shall
percentage
depletion
in
excess
of
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit
be
credited
to
the
depreciable
improvements
account.
congress
did
not...
i'm
sorry.
the
service...
and
these,
by
the
way,
are
substantive
rules
authorized
by
section
611.
the
service
quite
clearly
did
not
intend
to
allow
these
bases
to
be
commingled.
in
1937,
they
issued
a
ruling
which
states...
and
i
quote...
the
basis
of
depletable
property
must
be
set
up
as
an
item
separate
from
the
basis
of
depreciable
property.
so,
the
question
in
this
case
is
ultimately
and
directly
answered
by
the
regulations.
the
agency's
longstanding
requirement
that
a
separate
basis
be
maintained
reflects
a
fundamental
principle
of
tax
accounting.
as
judge
friendly
said
in
commissioner
v.
ferrar,
the
bases
of
even
closely
related
assets
must
be
maintained
separately
when
one
is
subject
to
one
kind
of
tax
treatment
and
the
other
is
subject
to
a
different
kind.
it
was
for
this
very
reason
that
in
the
united
states
v.
dakota-montana
case
in
1933
this
court
rejected
the
taxpayer's
claim
that
depletable
property
could
be
recovered
through
depreciation.
the
court
said
that
those
different
types
of
costs
must
be
recovered
through
the
separate
mechanisms
that
congress
provided,
and
the
basis
of
the
two
types
of
property,
therefore,
can't
be
commingled.
the
court
said
essentially
the
same
thing
in
parsons
v.
smith
when
they
said...
and
i
quote...
depreciable
equipment
is
not
an
investment
in
the
minerals
in
place.
the
legislative
history
of
the
'86
amendments
to
the
minimum
tax
confirms
this
same
distinction,
for
the
conference
report
to
the
bill
stated
that
the
depletion
preference
under
section
57
is...
and
i
quote
again...
the
excess
of
the
depletion
allowance
over
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
depletable
property.
it
is,
after
all,
excess
depletion,
not
excess
depreciation
that
the
depletion
tax
preference
in
section
57
addresses.
well,
what
the
court
below
concluded,
notwithstanding
all
of
this
evidence,
was
that
the
costs
of
depreciable
equipment
should
be
included
in
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
depletable
property
because
the
court
concluded
that
this
kind
of
physical
property
represents
an
improvement
to
the
mineral
deposit,
and
the
court
thought
that
under
section
1016
of
the
code
all
improvements
are
necessarily
to
be
merged
into
the
basis
of
the
assets
that
they
improve.
that
in
turn--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's
right.
if...
they
either
are
depreciable
or
they're
not.
if
they
are
depreciable,
they
have
to
be
maintained
separately.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
if
they're
merged--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that's...
that
doesn't
follow.
i
mean,
that
follows
logically,
but
that's
not
what
the
court
seemed
to
think.
the
courts--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
they
are
including...
they
are
depreciating
them,
and
they're
saying
that
they
should
be
included
in
the
basis
for
purposes
of
the...
in
determining
the
basis
of
the
depletable
property.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's...
that
would
be
their
ultimate
position.
i
don't
think
they've
been
pressed
to
describe
it
that
way.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
regulations
require
that
they
be
depreciated.
the
taxpayer
doesn't
have
an
election
here.
they
have
to
be
set
up
as
a
depreciable
asset.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
which
sections
because
there's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
26
u.s.c.
was
that
your
question?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
you
mean
if
i
had
set
them
out
in
the...
i
noticed
that
myself,
justice
scalia,
after
we
filed
the
brief.
i
think
it
would
have
been
helpful
if
we
had
had
additional
materials,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
they...
if
you
will
notice,
under
the
regs
under
612
and
611,
they
also
refer
the
reader
to
the
regs
under
section
1016.
and
as
i
was
trying
to
say
earlier,
that
is
because
1016(a)(2)
requires
that
the
basis
be
adjusted
downward
each
year
as
depletion
is
taken.
but
there's
a...
there's
a
larger
philosophical
and
practical
point
here
that
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
explain.
under
section
1016,
the
costs
of
improvements...
under
1016(a)(1),
the
costs
of
improvements
are
not
always
added
to
the
basis
of
the
asset
they
improve.
they
are
to
be
merged
only
with
that
asset
when,
as
the
statute
says,
it
is
proper
to
do
so.
if
we
take
the
simple
example
of
a
commercial
structure
built
on
a
tract
of
land,
the
land
is
not
a
depreciable
asset.
the
costs
of
the
land
are,
therefore,
to
be
maintained
in
a
basis
separate
from
the
costs
of
the
commercial
structure
which
is
depreciable.
the
regulations
under
section
167(a)(5)
require
that
result.
so,
even
though
the
commercial
structure
can
be
said
to
be
an
improvement
to
the
land,
the
costs
of
that
improvement
have
to
be
maintained
in
a
separate
basis.
this
court
recognized
in
the
dakota-montana
case
that
that
simple
example
applies
directly
to
mineral
enterprises.
a
mineral
deposit,
like
other
types
of
interests
in
land,
is
not
depreciable.
it
can
sit
there
for
a
billion
years
and
never
be
depreciated.
its
costs
are
to
be
recovered
by
depletion
only
as
production
occurs.
by
contrast,
the
depreciable
property
that
is
installed
on
the
location
can
be
depreciated
from
the
day
of
its
installation
without
regard
to
whether
production
occurs,
without
regard
to
the
quantity
of
production,
and
without
regard
to
whether
production
ceases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
reference
in
57(a)(8),
as
it
existed
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
is
to
the
property
as
defined
in
section
614.
under
614,
the
word
property
is
defined
as
mineral
deposit.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
regulations
under
614
make
that
express.
and
at
page
8
of
the
briefs
of
the
amicus
and
the
respondent,
they
concede
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit.
that's
why
i
compressed
that
issue
since
it
wasn't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
that's
the
short
answer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
i
shifted.
mineral
enterprise
is
a
different
regulatory
term.
mineral
enterprise
is
defined
in
the
regulations
under
611
as
the
mineral
deposit
and
improvements.
now,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
that
term,
mineral
enterprise,
has
been
known
to
congress
a
long
time,
and
so
if
congress
wanted
to
reach
the
result
that
the
courts
reached
in
this
case,
the
wording
in
the
statute
would
have
referred
not
to
the
adjusted
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit,
but
to
the
unrecovered
costs
of
the
mineral
enterprise.
that
is
the
result
that
the
courts
reached
here,
which
went
well
beyond
what
congress
wrote.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
term
mineral
deposit
is
defined
by
the
regulations
as
minerals
in
place.
the
term
mineral
enterprise
is
defined
by
the
regulations
as
mineral
deposit
plus
improvements.
section
611
has
in
its
text
a
separate
provision
for
depletion
and
for
depreciation
of
improvements.
and
so
on
occasion
it
is
relevant
to
group
the
entire
property
at
issue,
the
deposit
plus
the
improvements,
and
when
the
regulations
group
those
separate
constructs,
they
group
it
under
the
term
mineral
enterprise.
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
we
made
in
our
brief,
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
group
these
two
separate
concepts,
they
would
have
used
the
term
mineral
enterprise
in
doing
so.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
these
are
what
section
611
refers
to
as
improvements.
they
are
improvements
to
the
mineral
enterprise.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
wouldn't
say
mislead
you.
i
think
that
this
is
to
a
large
degree
a
semantical
question
about
what
is
being
improved.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
raise
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
again,
i
have
no
recourse
but
to
apologize
if
we
should
have
done
it
differently,
but
it
appears
to
me
that
this...
the
purely
semantical
question
is
what
does
this
improve.
it
doesn't
matter
what
it
improves
because
the
regulations
say
that
improve...
the
basis
of
improvements
are
to
be
kept
separately
from
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit.
i
think
that
it
is
more
logical
to
apply
the
terminology
that
the
regulations
apply,
that
what
is
improved
is
the
mineral
enterprise;
in
the
same
way,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
a
manufacturing
enterprise
may
be
improved
by
adding
a
machine
to
a
plant,
but
you
would
keep
the
basis
of
those
assets
separately
and
account
for
them
separately.
i
want
to
stress
just
for
a
moment
the
import...
that
this
issue
remains
vitally
important
even
for
years
after
this
recent
amendment
to
the
minimum
tax.
of
course,
as
we've
told
you,
it
involves
a
good
deal
of
money
before
and
after
the
enactment,
but
there's
another
important
way
in
which
the
application
of
this
tax
to
other
types
of
minerals
production
is
of
extreme
importance.
these
other
types
of
minerals
production
are
not
subject
to
the
restrictions
that
are
applicable
to
oil
and
gas
depletion
allowance,
and
so
they
are...
they
have
more
opportunity
to
obtain
this
depletion
allowance,
more--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
and
would
be
recovered
over
a
long
time.
and
that
perhaps
focuses
the
greatest
illogical
feature
of
this
court's...
of
the
lower
court's
decision
because
it
allows
the
unrecovered
depreciable
cost
to
be
set
off
against
the
depletion
allowance
each
year
even
if
prior
depletion
allowances
have
fully
recovered
all
of
the
costs
of
the
mineral
enterprise.
as
several
of
the
commentators
have
pointed
out,
this
utterly
eviscerates
the
minimum
tax
as
applied
to
these
types
of
minerals
producers
with
large
amounts
of
depreciable
equipment,
and
as
the
amicus
brief
for
the
coal
and
hard
minerals
industry
in
this
case
has
pointed
out...
and
we
agree
with
it...
their
coverage
under
the
minimum
tax
will
be
decided
by
this
court's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
that's...
that
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that...
that
notes
the
marked
distinction
that
the
regulations
require
between
the
basis
for
depreciable
and
depletable
property.
they're
to
be
kept
separately.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
agree
with
that.
the
regulation
states
what...
what
proper
tax
accounting
requires.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
these
regs
are
rather
complicated.
the
percent...
in
611-2(b)(2),
the
regs
say
that
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
shall
in
excess
of...
maybe
i
had
better
quote
it.
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
justice
scalia,
in
somewhat
self-defense,
there's
an
awful
lot
of
text
here,
but
i
suppose
we
could
have
put
it
all
in
a...
in
an
appendix.
the
611-2(b)(2)
reg
says
in
no
event
shall
percentage
depletion
in
excess
of
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit
be
credited
to
the
depreciable
improvements
account.
so
that
observes
for
percentage
depletion
the
same
distinction
between
depletion
account
and
improvements
account.
it
runs
throughout
the
regs
and
it
appears
in
many
places.
that
is
the
clearest
expression
that
the
service,
who
is
the
authoritative
interpreter
of
this
substantive
regulation
and
whose
interpretation
is
entitled
to
deference...
but
it
is
the
clearest
expression
of
the
service's
views
that
percentage
depletion
should
be
kept...
that
the
account
of
the
mineral
deposit
for
percentage
depletion
purposes
must
be
kept
separately
from
the
account
of
depreciable
property.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
note
that
and
i...
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
scalia,
in
reviewing
the
materials
in
preparation
for
argument,
i
felt
the
same
deficiency.
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
i
did
want
to
clear
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
have
been
a
confusion
in
the
discussion
that
i
just
heard.
the
respondents
claim
a
right
to
depreciate
the
physical
property.
they
also
claim
a
right
to
add
the
costs
of
that
property
into
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit
for
purposes
of
determining
the
amount
of
the
tax
preference.
so,
in
that
respect,
as
justice
white
discussed
at
the
beginning,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
they're
trying
to
merge
these...
merge
the
adjustments
and
the
deductions
in
a
way
that's
just
logically
inconsistent,
as
well
as
inconsistent
with
the
regulations.
and
as
far
as
the
question
about
why
is
it
that
some
kinds
of
intangible
drilling
costs
are
added
to
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit,
but
tangible
improvements
are
not,
well,
there's
the
fact
that
that's
the
way
the
regulations
require
them
to
be
treated,
but
this
court
dealt
with
that
issue
at
length
in
1933
in
the
dakota-montana
case.
and
the
court's
explanation
of
the
different
treatment
was
that
the
costs
of
drilling
a
hole
in
the
ground
don't
depreciate
over
time
and
have
a
salvage
value,
the
way
that
a
machine
or
a
pump
does.
so,
it's
not
depreciable
over
time
in
the
way
depreciable
property
is.
what
the
court
said
in
dakota-montana
is
that
the
hole
simply
adds
to
the
value
of
the
mineral
deposit,
the
minerals
in
the
ground,
and
that
that
is
the
logical
reason
for
joining
the
intangible
drilling
costs
with
the
mineral
deposit.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
involve
the
minimum
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
it
certainly
does
explain
the
rather
stark
line
that
the
court
has
recognized
for
60
years
between
the
separate
bases
of
depletable
and
depreciable
property,
and
that's
the
primary
relevance
of
it
for
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not
in
figuring
the
allowance
per
se.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
only
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
their
tax
preference
from
depletion.
they're
saying
that
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
excess
depletion
they've
recovered,
they
should
be
able
to
set
off
the
unrecovered
depreciable
costs.
but
the
only
way
they
can
reach
that
result
is
by
showing
that
these
unrecovered
depreciable
costs
form
part
of
the
basis
of
the
mineral
deposit,
and
that's
where
their
argument
breaks
down
because
the
regulations
and
this
court's
decisions
and
the
service's
rulings
specifically
require
that
those
accounts
be
kept
separately.
and
the
logic
of
the
minimum
tax
requires
that
they
be
kept
separately
too
because,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
as
commentators
have
pointed
out,
if
you're
allowed
to
each
year
set
off
these
unrecovered
depreciable
costs
against
the
depletion
allowance,
the
result
is
to
create
a
gaping
hole
in
the
coverage
of
the
act
and
to
allow
large
amounts
of
excess
depletion
wholly
to
escape
taxation,
which
is
precisely
contrary
to
the
objectives
of
the
minimum
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
it's
really
quite
that
simple,
justice
scalia.
when
the
minimum
tax
was
enacted,
what
congress
said
was...
and
in
the
legislative
reports...
what
they
said
was
that
they
were
concerned
that
these
tax
preferences
were
destroying
taxpayer
morale,
and
by
that
what
they
meant
was
that
our
tax
system
is
based
upon
each
individual's
obligation
to
report
and
pay
their
taxes.
and
congress
was
concerned
that
if
certain
taxpayers
were
allowed
to
escape
utterly
from
federal
tax,
it
would
have
a
devastating
impact
on
the
long-range
morale
of
the
taxpayers
and
the
ability
of
the
system
to
work
as
a
whole.
and
so,
it
does
serve
that
very
important
function.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
certainly
agree
with
that,
but
our
point
is
that
the
analysis
of
the
courts
below
would
result
in
a
large
amount
each
year
that
would
be
exempt
from
the
effect
of
the
tax
in--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
amount
of
investment
required
for
production...
i
mean,
you
don't
necessarily
get
more
production
by
more
investment,
but
those
kinds
of
economic
issues
are
really
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
because
what
the
statute
says,
what
congress
said,
was
that
in
deciding
the
amount
of
the
preference,
it's
simply
the
amount
of
the
depletion
above
the
basis
of
the
deposit.
that
was
their
economic
judgment.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
basic
reason
is
to
provide
an
incentive,
and
the
flip
side
of
that
incentive
is
the
abuse.
and
to
the
extent
there's
an
abuse,
the
tax
applies,
but
the
abuse
is
defined
by
congress
as
simply
the
amount
of
the
depletion
in
excess
of
the
adjusted
basis.
