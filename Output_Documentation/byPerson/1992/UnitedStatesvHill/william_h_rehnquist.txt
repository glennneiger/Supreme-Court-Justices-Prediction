we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-1421,
united
states
against
william
f.
hill.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
congress
enact
the
minimum
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
the
definitions
of
mineral
enterprise
and
mineral
deposit
differ?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that
with
hard
minerals,
the
tangible
costs
for
replacing
equipment
are
very,
very
high.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
it
may
not
be
your
fault,
but
i
think
it's
a
reflection
on
the
government
in
this
case
that
all
the
statutory
and
regulatory
material
that
you
wish
to
have
us
consider
was
not
included
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
distinguished
from
the
cost
of
drilling
the
well
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
drilling
the
well
is
in
your
view
an
intangible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
what
are
the
expenses
that
you're
claiming
the
depletion
on?
that
is
just
the
cost
of
drilling
the
well?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
you
treat
those
for
tax
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
capitalizing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
are
you
suggesting
that
you
treat
your
pipes
and
so
forth
different
from
the
casing
to
your
well?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
your
brief
will
we
find
the
text
of
612.4?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
in
the
briefs
if
you
haven't
a
better
way--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
does
it
set
it
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
where
in
your
brief
is
it
if
you're
relying
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
reflects
on
you,
mr.
robinson--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
same
way
the
government's
failure...
if
you
want
us
to
consider
something,
it
ought
to
be
fully
set
out
in
the
text
of
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
robinson.
mr.
jones,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
