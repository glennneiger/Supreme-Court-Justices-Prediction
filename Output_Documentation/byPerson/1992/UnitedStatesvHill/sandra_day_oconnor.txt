justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
mr.
jones,
congress
has
recently
enacted
another
change?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
by
virtue
of
the
most
recent
change,
i
guess
no
minimum
tax
will
be
applied
to
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
indicates
that
at
least
the
present
congress
isn't
viewing
the
situation
quite
like
you
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
jones,
since
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i
thought
that
the
regulation,
1.571(h),
was
particularly
relevant
in
this
case,
and
yet
your
brief
doesn't
really
address
it
or
discuss
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
this
regulation
1.57
at
least
can
be
read
to
mean
that
the
special
rule
referred
to
in
the
regulation
1.612
doesn't
apply.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so,
i
just
wondered
why
you
didn't
even
talk
about
it.
