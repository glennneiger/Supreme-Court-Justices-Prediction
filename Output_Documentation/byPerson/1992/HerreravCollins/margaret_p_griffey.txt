ms.
margaret
p.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
post
trial
consideration
of
newly
asserted
evidence
relevant
to
guilt
and
the
reassessment
of
the
likelihood
of
guilt
based
on
such
evidence
by
a
reviewing
court
is
not
required
by
the
constitution,
nor
can
authority
for
such
review
be
derived
from
the
constitution
under
existing
constitutional
analysis.
the
trial
is
the
constitutionally
designated
procedure
for
the
determination
of
guilt
and
the
executive
clemency
is
the
mechanism
envisioned
by
the
drafters
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
constitutions
of
the
50
states
to
correct
an
unjust
conviction
or
to
prevent
the
imposition
of
an
apparently
unjust
sentence
when
that
conviction
or
sentence
cannot
be
corrected
by
existing
standards
or
procedures.
the
rule
proposed
by
herrera
would
require
reviewing
court
to
reassess
the
likelihood
of
guilt
whenever
a
defendant
asserts
additional
evidence
after
trial
in
an
attempt
to
establish
a
reasonable
doubt.
such
a
rule
would
transform
the
trial
into
but
a
preliminary
determination
of
guilt,
it
would
encourage
sand
bagging
of
available
evidence
in
defenses,
and
in
the
capital
context
would
require
a
reviewing
court
to
enter
repeated
stays
of
execution
to
consider
a
defendant's
untimely
assertions
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
such
post
trial
reassessment
of
the
likelihood
of
guilt
would
be
inherently
less
reliable
than
the
trial
process
itself.
it
would
require
a
reviewing
court
to
weigh
unreliable,
motivated
evidence
advanced
years
after
trial
by
the
defendant
against
the
cold
trial
record.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
an
alibi
defense
can
easily
be
fabricated
and
a
defense
witness
who
is
not
identified
until
the
eleventh
hour
is
inherently
suspect.
as
a
practical
matter
a
defendant's
actual
innocence
could
only
under
the
most
unusual
circumstances
be
characterized
as
newly
discovered.
a
defendant
normally
knows
whether
he
committed
the
crime
or
not.
where,
as
is
true
in
herrera's
case,
a
defendant
fails
to
offer
any
defense
at
trial
but
simply
puts
the
state
to
his
proof,
the
assertion
immediately
prior
to
his
scheduled
execution
date
of
a
claim
of
actual
innocence
based
on
newly
asserted
evidence
must
be
presumptively
unreliable.
herrera's
case
demonstrates
both
the
inappropriateness
of
a
reviewing
court's
relitigating
guilt
and
the
potential
for
abuse
is
inherent
in
constitutionalizing
such
a
procedure.
herrera's
newly
asserted
evidence,
if
true,
would
necessarily
have
been
available
to
him
at
the
time
of
trial
upon
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
innocence
is
paramount
to--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--certainly
innocence
is
paramount.
the
designated
procedure
for
determining
innocence
is
the
trial
process
itself.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
right.
and
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
determination
of
guilt
that
is
accomplished
at
the
trial
process
is
the
only
determination
of
guilt
that
if
the
state
chooses
to
afford,
for
instance
via
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
mechanism,
a
vehicle
whereby
a
defendant
can
assert
additional
evidence
relevant
to
guilt,
that
is
within
the
state's
prerogative.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
definitely.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
my
understanding
upon
an
inquiry
to
the
governor's
office
is
that
they
have
presented
a
request
for
a
reprieve.
that
would
be
a
30-day
reprieve
that
can
only
be
given
once
by
the
governor.
it
does
not
require
the
vote
of
the
board
of
the
pardons
and
paroles
for
her
to
grant
this
reprieve,
and
that
the
basis
of
the
request
for
the
reprieve
was
to
allow
additional
time
to
develop
a
claim
of
actual
innocence.
that
request
has
never
been
ruled
upon.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes,
they
would
be.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
that
has
not
happened
in
my
knowledge.
i
have
heard
of
no
reports
of
anything
like
that.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no,
they
haven't.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
think
that
that,
and
that
is
a
criticism
that
of
course
has
been
levelled
at
the
clemency
process,
is
that
it,
you
don't
often
see
a
death
sentence
being
set
aside.
of
course
this
can
reflect
many
factors,
one
being
that
most
people
on
death
row
are
actually
guilty,
and
number
two,
the
fact
that
many
of
the
considerations
that
used
to
lead
to
the
exercise
of
clemency
are
now
part
of
the
individualized
sentencing
concerns
that
are
required
by
the
eighth
amendment
in
the
capital
sentencing
context.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
no.
they
did
grant
a
reprieve
within
the
last
year,
there
was
a
30-day
reprieve,
and
ultimately
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
voted
against
the
clemency
procedure.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
make
one
notation
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
court.
there
are
three
ways
by
which
a
request
for
clemency
can
be
raised
in
the
texas
system.
one
is
upon
the
request
of
the
governor
herself.
she
can
request
that
the
board
consider
the
matter.
the
other
is
the
request
of
the
majority
of
trial
officials,
which
includes
the
prosecutor,
the
trial
judge,
and
the
sheriff
of
the
county.
and
the
third
way
is
the
request
of
the
defendant
and
the
defendant's
counsel.
that
way
is
only
available
in
the
capital
sentencing
context.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
that's
correct.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
what
was
done
here
was
a
request
for
the
30-day
reprieve
to
allow
them
to
develop
additional
evidence
to,
you
know,
to
make
a
thorough
request
for
clemency.
herrera's
newly
asserted
evidence--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
in
our
view
there--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--no,
it
would
not
be
violative
of
the
constitution
under
those
circumstances.
i
don't
think
that
circumstance
is
likely
to
happen.
i
think
that
it
underestimates
the
interests
that
the
governor
has
in
seeing
to
it
that
not
only
the
executive
authority
but
the
authority
of
the
criminal
system
itself
is
carried
out
accurately
and
appropriately,
and
it
would
only
undermine
the
confidence
of
the
citizenry
if
the
governor
or
the
board
were
to
act
in
an
arbitrary
manner.
and
i
also
to
think
it's
important
to
note
at
this
point
that
clemency
and
commutation
is
a
procedure
and
a
mechanism
that
operates
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant.
it
would
operate
to
the
advantage
of
herrera
in
this
case.
because
it
is
not
bound
by
procedural
rules
and
burdens
of
proof
and
technical
limitations,
it
can
be
exercised
based
on
evidence
that
would
not
be
admissible
at
trial
and
it
can
be
based
on
less
than
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
in
herrera's
case
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
governor
granting
him
clemency
even
though
a
jury
could
easily
reject
his
evidence
and
find
him
guilty
upon
his
newly
asserted
evidence
and
find
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
upon
retrial.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
would
say
in
texas,
given
the
fact
that
we
have
an
elected
judiciary,
that's
a
hard
call.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes,
definitely.
that
is
true.
and
i
think
also
the
governor,
being
closer
to
the
scene
of
the
offense,
so
to
speak,
is
better
able
to
marshall
the
information
necessary
to
make
that
clemency
determination.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
it
is,
your
honor,
but
there
are
several
factors
that
distinguish
the
ford
case.
first
of
all,
the
post
trial
determination
of
competency
required
by
ford
was
well
founded
in
both
the
historical
and
the
contemporary
practice.
by
contrast,
the
limitless
retrial
and
reassessment
of
newly
asserted
evidence
proposed
by
herrera
would
impose
upon
a
reviewing
court
a
process
of
review
that
is
without
historical
or
common
law
precedent
and
one
that
is
far
from
the
unanimously
accepted
practic
of
the
states.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
well,
of
course
jackson
v.
virginia
is
a
due
process
case--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--but
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
due
process
rights
that
are
derived
from
the
due
process
clause
are
limited
to
the
procedures
that
adhere
to
the
process
by
which
a
defendant
is
brought
to
trial,
tried,
and
sentenced.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes,
i
do,
and
i
agree
though
that
the
heightened
requirement
of
reliability
in
the
capital
context
is
designed
to
assure
the
reliability
of
the
sentencing
process.
at
issue
here
is
not
the
reliability
of
the
sentencing
process.
what
we
have
here
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
the
defendant
is
in
fact
guilty.
we
don't
even
have
an
issue
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
trial
process
in
this
case,
so
how,
you
know,
we
don't
really
have
any
unreliability
of
process.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
it
is
my
contention
that--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that's
my
contention
and
my
contention
is
that
unlike
ford
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
dictate
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case
and
that
no
constitutional
violation
can
be
derived
under
existing
due
process
analysis.
and
so
for
that
reason--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--that
is
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
think
that's
the
issue
and
i
think
that
no,
it
would
not.
it
would
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment
as
long
as
he
has
been
found
guilty
in
a
trial
process
to
which
all
the
myriad
of
constitutional
protections
adhered
and
there
was
no
constitutional
violation--
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
--the
way
i
understood
the
issue
was
that
a
death
penalty
couldn't
be
imposed
upon
someone
who
you
had
latter
day
evidence
that
raised
an
issue
as
to
actual
evidence,
as
to
actual
innocence,
although
perhaps
you
could
impose
a
sentence
of
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole
upon
that
person.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
they
just
said
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
in
this
case
and
that
newly
discovered
evidence
relevant
to
guilt
was
not
cognizable
in
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
violation.
ford
is
distinguished
by
another
factor.
the
determination
of
competency
to
be
executed
required
by
ford
is
one
that
is
most
appropriately
and
most
accurately
made
near
the
time
of
a
scheduled
execution.
an
assessment
of
guilt
on
the
other
hand
is
only
likely
to
become
less
accurate
with
the
passage
of
time.
not
only
did
the
constitution
clearly
envision
the
trial
as
the
procedure
by
which
the
guilt
of
a
defendant
would
be
determined,
guilt
is
most
accurately
determined
at
that
point,
near
the
time
of
the
offense,
in
the
trial
proceeding
to
which
the
myriad
constitutional
protections
adhere.
due
process
clause,
likewise,
does
not
require
post
trial
consideration
of
newly
asserted
evidence
relevant
to
guilt.
the
clause
has
limited
operation
beyond
the
specific
guarantees
of
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
that
adhere
to
the
criminal
procedures
by
which
a
defendant
is
brought
to
trial
and
tried.
due
process
does
not
secure
procedures,
the
due
process
clause
does
not
secure
procedures
that
are
distinct
or
independent
of
the
constitutionally
designated
trial
process.
for
example,
despite
the
contemporary
practice
of
providing
a
defendant
with
an
appeal
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
his
trial
and
conviction,
the
due
process
clause
does
not
guarantee
an
appeal.
by
analogy
it
follows
that
due
process
does
not
guarantee
a
post
trial
procedure
by
which
a
defendant
can
relitigate
guilt,
a
procedure
that
is
unrelated
to
the
constitutionally
designated
trial
process
for
determining
guilt.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
in
that
case
the
invalid
conviction
was
being
offered
only
to,
relevant
to
the
sentencing
determination.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
guilt
determination
that
they
are
claiming
can
be
rendered
unreliable
by
newly
asserted
evidence.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
under
that
analysis,
however,
any
error
that
accrued
to
the
trial
would
become
an
eighth
amendment
error,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
analysis
that
has
been
employed
by
this
court.
any
piece
of
evidence,
no
matter
to
what
aspect
of
the
definition
of
the
crime,
that
was
later
demonstrated
to
be
unreliable
or
whatever
would
automatically
pertain
to
the
sentencing
process.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
yes.
beck
was
based
on
both
an
eighth
amendment
and
a
due
process
analysis,
and
the
beck
analysis
with
respect
to
the
eighth
amendment
made
it
very
clear
that
because
the
sentencing
decision
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
also
encompassed
the
jury's
feelings
as
to
the
death
penalty
because
of
the
unique
way
in
which
the
alabama
statute
was
structured,
alabama
was,
under
their
statute
at
that
time
the
jury
either
had
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
and
at
once
find
him
eligible
for
the
death
sentence
or
find
him
innocent
and
acquit
him.
and
they
said
that
the
guilt
or
innocence
determination
would
be,
also
reflect
the
feelings
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
death
penalty
and
that
that
would
violate
the
need
for
reliable
and
guided
discretion
as
to
the
exercise
of
the
sentencing
determination.
so
i
don't
think
that
beck
per
se
can
be
cited
for
the
proposition
that
all
guilt/innocence
inquiries
are
relevant
to
the
sentencing
determination.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
it
is
clear
that
the
state
has
no
obligation
as
a
constitutional
matter,
although
they
routinely
do,
to
provide
for
direct
appeal
and
state
collateral
review.
ms.
margaret
p.
griffey
i
believe
that
the
constitutional
minimum,
so
to
speak,
would
be
that
you
could
abolish
federal
habeas
and
that
the
only
avenue
of
relief
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
a
conviction
would
be
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
by
writ
of
error.
thank
you.
