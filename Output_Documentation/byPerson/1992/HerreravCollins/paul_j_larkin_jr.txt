mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
history
of
the
development
of
federal
rule
33,
which
is
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure
dealing
with
motions
for
a
new
trial,
is
instructive
in
this
regard.
it's
instructive
because
the
debate
that's
being
conducted
today
in
terms
of
the
due
process
and
eighth
amendment
provisions
of
the
constitution
was
the
type
of
debate
that
was
conducted
in
the
legal
community
nearly
50
years
ago
that
this
court
heard
and
considered
before
it
adopted
what
is
the
current
version
of
now
rule
33.
originally
the
federal
courts
could
grant
a
new
trial
in
accordance
with
the
common
law
rule.
in
order
to
obtain
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
of
newly
discovered
evidence
the
defendant
would
have
to
seek
relief
during
the
term
of
court
in
which
he
was
originally
sentenced.
in
1934
this
court
modified
the
common
law
rule.
in
the
criminal
appeals
rules
a
district
court
was
authorized
to
award
a
defendant
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
a
newly
discovered
evidence
claim
if
the
defendant
sought
relief
within
60
days
of
the
day
that
the
sentence
became
final.
4
years
later,
in
1938,
this
court
modified
the
rule
to
allow
a
condemned
prisoner
to
file
a
claim
of
newly
discovered
evidence
at
any
time
before
the
sentence
was
carried
out.
at
that
point,
late
in
the
thirties
and
early
in
the
forties,
there
was
considerable
debate
in
the
legal
community
over
the
question
whether
all
time
limits
for
such
motions
should
be
abolished.
the
argument
in
favor
of
their
abolition
was
that
eliminating
time
periods
was
necessary
to
prevent
miscarriages
of
justice.
the
contrary
argument,
the
argument
in
favor
of
the
retention
of
such
time
periods,
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
promote
finality.
after
hearing
this
debate
this
court
decided
that
the
arguments
in
favor
of
finality
outweighed
those
in
favor
of
avoiding
any
risk
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
in
1944
this
court
adopted
what
is
now
known
as
rule
33
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures.
that
rule
sets
a
2-year
time
period
within
which
motions
seeking
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence
must
be
filed.
that
rule
is
jurisdictional.
and
in
setting
that
rule
this
court
abolished
the
special
exception
that
previously
had
existed
for
capital
cases.
the
upshot
is
under
today's
rules
applicable
in
the
federal
system
capital
cases
or
non-capital
cases
are
treated
alike.
now,
it
would
be
wrong,
we
think,
to
assume
that
today
society
for
the
first
time--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
applied
to
cases
such
as
murder,
treason,
it
applied
to
such
cases
that
you
don't
ordinarily
see,
but
wrecking
a
train
that
results
in
death.
there
were
capital
cases
on
the
books
at
the
time
and
there
are
capital
cases
today.
neither
this
court
nor
congress
nor
anyone
else
has
modified
this
rule--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--imposed?
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
last
one
that
was
imposed
by
a
jury
was
imposed
i
believe
either
in
1991
or
in
1990.
there
is
a
capital
case
now
on
appeal
to
the
eleventh
circuit
stemming
from--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
last
one
carried
out
was
in
the
1960's,
but
there
were
death
sentences
carried
out
by
the
federal
government
after
this
rule
went
into
effect
in
1944.
now
we
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
say
that
society
today
for
the
first
time
is
concerned
about
the
risk
of
convicting,
imprisoning,
or
executing
an
innocent
defendant.
and
it
would
also
be
a
mistake
to
conclude
that
today
the
balance
of
interests
that
might
be
conducted
is
so
far
superior
to
the
balance
of
interests
that
was
conducted
by
this
court
nearly
a
half
century
ago
that
no
time
period
can
be
said
to
be
valid.
in
fact
the
contemporary
evidence
in
this
regard
supports
the
continued
vitality
of
this
court's
judgment.
most
states
have
fixed
time
periods
for
the
consideration
of
newly
discovered
evidence
motions.
the
relevant
rules
and
laws
are
collected
in
appendix
a
to
our
brief.
under
those
laws
petitioner
could
not
have
obtained
relief
in
the
courts
of
at
least
35
states,
if
not
41.
we
think
this
widespread
recognition
that
there
should
be
some
time
period
within
which
new
trial
motions
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence
must
be
brought.
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
constitution
supplies
no
objective
basis
for
preferring
one
time
period
over
another
indicates
that
it
is
not
fundamentally
unfair
to
set
a
fixed
time
period
for
the
consideration
in
court
of
such
motions
and
thereafter
to
channel
such
motions
to
the
process
of
executive
clemency.
in
fact
chief
justice
harlen
fisk
stone
made
that
precise
point
in
1944
when
he
transmitted
to
the
federal
rules
advisory
committee
this
court's
comments
on
what
ultimately
became
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
33.
chief
justice
stone
rhetorically
asked
is
it
not
desirable
that
at
some
point
of
time
further
consideration
of
criminal
cases
by
the
court
should
be
at
an
end
after
which
appeal
should
be
made
to
executive
clemency
alone.
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
chief
justice
stone's
question
is
yes,
the
same
answer
this
court
gave
nearly
a
half
century
ago.
the
procedure
he
described
is
the
procedure
we
have
historically
followed,
and
that
historical
procedure
is
fully
consistent
with
due
process.
thank
you.
