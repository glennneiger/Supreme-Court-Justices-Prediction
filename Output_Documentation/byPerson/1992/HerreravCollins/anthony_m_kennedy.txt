justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
they
commuted
his
sentence
to
life
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
don't
see
why
the
principle
is
any
different.
why
is
it--
--that's
not
cruel
and
unusual?
that's
not
cruel
and
unusual,
to
leave
him
in
prison
for
life
although
he
has
a
colorable--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
of
course,
counsel,
in
kuhlmann
the
question
was
the
sufficience
of
the
evidence
under
jackson
v.
virginia.
there
it
was
a
standard.
that
is
not
what
you're
arguing
here,
so
the
cases
are
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
just
a
threshold
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
could
hear
other
allegations
of
constitutional
error,
which
is
quite
different
from
this
case.
let
me
ask
you
in
this
case,
counsel,
suppose
a
defendant
elects
not
to
bring
forward
a
certain
line
of
testimony
in
order
to
protect
his
brother
who
is
the
true
perpetrator
of
the
crime.
the
defendant
is
innocent.
he
is
convicted.
can
he
later
demand
a
new
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he's
innocent.
we
all
know
he's
innocent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
other
words
you
have
two
shots
at
the
judicial
system?
you
can
elect
a
strategy
that
fails
and
then
because
you're
really
innocent
you
can
start
all
over
again?
you
can
double
deal
the
judicial
system
in
that
way
just
because
death
is
at
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
such
a
paramount
value,
i
suppose,
if
the
defendant
elects
to
remain
silent.
he's
an
innocent
defendant.
the
trial
goes
badly
for
him,
and
now
he
wants
to
testify
and
say
all
he
knows
about
that.
i
would
say
he
must
get
a
new
hearing
under
your
view,
because
innocence
is
paramount.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
want
to
know...
we're
entitled
to
probe
the
parameters
of
the
rule
that
you
are
suggesting
that
we
adopt
in
this
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
my
view
all
of
your
submissions
so
far
indicate
that
the
answer
to
my
hypothetical
question
must
be
in
the
affirmative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are,
mr.
d'alemberte,
charged
with
developing
and
expounding
the
rule
that
that
judge
must
follow.
and
you
are
arguing
to
us
for
a
rule
that
would
require
that
judge
at
least
to
exercise
his
discretion
whether
or
not
to
hold
a
hearing
in
the
situation
which
we
suppose,
and
i
want
to
know
what
guides
that
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
d'alemberte--
--again
you
must
remember
all
those
were
thresholds
to
reaching
other
constitutional
errors,
which
is
not
what
you're
arguing
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
understand.
was
that
done
here
and
has
not
been
acted
upon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose,
you
know,
you're
ready
for
the
tough
questions.
suppose
you
have
a
video
tape
which
conclusively
shows
the
person
is
innocent
and
you
have
a
state
which
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
law
or
both
simply
does
not
hear
new
evidence
claims
in
its
clemency
proceeding.
is
there
a
federal
constitutional
violation
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
not
be
violative
of
the
constitution
then
to
execute
the
person
under
those
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
governor
is
more
accountable
to
the
electorate
than
are
the
courts.
is
that
an
additional
factor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
thinking
of
the
federal
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
could
you
discuss
johnson
v.
mississippi
briefly?
there
the
trial
proceeding
was
in
all
respects
correct,
but
then
later
new
york
upsets
the
conviction
and
we
require
the
state
of
mississippi
to
afford
a
post
conviction
procedure
for
resentencing.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case
from
this
one?
there
in
order
to
prevent
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
that
was,
of
a
sentence
that
was
faulty
we
required
that
a
collateral
procedure
be
followed.
why
isn't
that
support
for
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
a
sense
this
case
is
an
a
fortiorari
case
then.
if
we
can
set
aside
sentencing,
certainly
it
follows
with
even
greater
force
that
we
could
set
aside
a
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
have
said
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies
to
the
guilt
determination
phase.
we
require
that
the
jury
be
instructed
on
lesser
degrees
of
offenses,
for
instance.
