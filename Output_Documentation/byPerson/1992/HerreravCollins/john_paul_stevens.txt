justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
would
you
not
agree
though
that,
perhaps
not
in
this
case
but
in
cases
like
this,
the
district
judge
does
have
some
discretion
to
say
well,
you've
got
one
affidavit
there
but
i
think
it's
so
highly
improbable
that
i'm
not
going
to
go
forward?
that's
certainly
an
option
for
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
texas
board
of
pardons
hasn't
set
aside
a
great
many
death
sentences,
has
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
one
of
their
favorite
activities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
griffey,
your
argument
on
this
point
is
really
much
like
the
argument
that
the
state
made
in
the
ford
case
on
executing
a
person
who
is
not
competent
to
know
what's
happening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
same
was
true
of
jackson
against
virginia.
they
never
had
looked
at
the
weight
of
the
evidence
before
that
case,
and
frankly
i
dissented
in
that
case
because
i
thought
it
was
going
to
lead
to
a
parade
of
horribles,
we
would
be
having
retrials
over
and
over
and
over
again.
my
predictions
didn't
turn
out.
sometimes
these
are,
they
don't
really
have
to
have
as
many
hearings
as
you
suggest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
was
a
minimum
standard
of
evidence
that
was
required,
which
was
created
in
that
case
for
the
first
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
but
under
the
eighth
amendment,
as
your
opponent
has
stressed,
we
have
had
several
procedural
rules
that
are
more
stringent
in
the
death
context
because
the
court
has
said
death
is
different.
i
don't
know
if
you
ask
us
to
abandon
that
or
you
just
want
to
assume
that
we,
if
we
adopt
this
we
must
adopt
it
for
every
misdemeanor
and
everything
else.
do
you
agree
that
death
is
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
the
very
issue
in
the
case
is
whether,
if
there
is
sufficiently
persuasive
evidence,
and
assume
it's
just
everyone
would
agree
that
it
establishes
innocence,
but
his
trial
was
fair,
the
jury
just
made
a
mistake.
is
there
a
constitutional
right
under
the
eighth
amendment
not
to
be
executed
when
you're
innocent?
that's
the
issue.
and
i
think
you're
saying
no,
there's
no
such
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
the
issue,
isn't
it?
is
it
whether...
assuming
he
can
establish
his
innocence,
would
it
violate
the
eighth
amendment
to
execute
him
even
if
he
had
a
fair
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
that
a
mistake
was
made
and
a
man
may
be
executed
does
not
raise
a
constitutional
issue?
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
do
you
think,
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
a
death
penalty
would
have
been
imposed
in
light
of
the
newly
discovered
evidence,
not
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
really
aren't,
the
rule
didn't
apply
to
very
many
capital
cases
when
it
was
adopted,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
last
death
sentence
that
the
federal
government
has
imposed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
used
the
wrong
word.
when
has
the
last
one
been
carried
out,
federal?
