justice
byron
r.
white
--you
mean
innocence
of
the
death
penalty,
so
to
speak.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
challenging,
would
you
be
making
this
argument
if
texas
had
a,
say
a
5-year
time
limit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
that,
do
you
think
that
a
judge
presented
with
newly
discovered
evidence
of
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
offense,
do
you
think
he's
entitled
before
ordering
a
hearing
to
ask
himself
or
herself
well,
even
with
the
newly
discovered
evidence
is
there
any
argument
that
the
jackson
rule,
that
jackson
is
not
or
is
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
need
to
grant
a
hearing
if
he
thinks
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
submission
is,
falls
short
of
the
threshold.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
say
we
disagreed
with
you
that
there's
no
time
limit
on
claims
of
innocence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
say
that
we
would
say
to
ourselves
at
least
they
have
to
come
in
before
10
years.
now
you,
you
wouldn't
win
this
case
just
because
the
state
has
a
30-day
limit,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel,
isn't
there
a
constitutional
rule
about
what,
how
much
evidence
there
has
to
be
to
convict?
doesn't
jackson
say
that
the
evidence
has
to
reach
a
certain
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event
there
is
a
constitutional
rule
about
the
quantum
of
evidence
that
there
needs
to
be
to
convict.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
that,
you're
saying
that
with
the
newly
discovered
evidence
that
standard
would
not
be
met.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
you
win
on
that
hearing?
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
a
probable,
would
probably
have
an
effect
on
the
jury.
then
you're
going
to
get
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
have
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
really
in
effect
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
usually
people,
even
in
florida
the
jury
is
the
one
who
first
hears
all
that
stuff
and
makes
a
recommendation.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
why
shouldn't
that
be...
if
you,
if
you
have
this,
if
the
judge
thinks
that
you
have
a
colorable
claim,
why
shouldn't
it
go
to
a
jury
trial
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
decision
below
on
the
grounds
that
the
court
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
said
this
evidence
wouldn't,
wouldn't
be
heard
because
it
wasn't,
didn't
go
to
some
constitutional,
show
some
constitutional
violation.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
go
about
it?
did
it
talk
about
innocence
of
the
death
penalty
or
innocence
of
the
crime?
