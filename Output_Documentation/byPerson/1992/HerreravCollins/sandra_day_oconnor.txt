justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
at
bottom
you
have
a
claim
of
innocence
of
the
conviction,
i
mean
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
conviction,
do
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
does
the
eighth
amendment
bear
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
the
question
presented,
the
first
question
presented,
as
i
read
it,
says
whether
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
permit
a
state
to
execute
an
individual
who
is
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
don't
really
think
that's
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us,
do
you?
there's
an
allegation
of
innocence.
he
comes
to
us
as
a
guilty
defendant.
he
has
been
found
guilty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
question
was
not
presented
to
us
in
the
language
you
have
just
used,
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
most
states
have
provisions
for
letting
a
convicted
defendant
come
in
with
new
evidence,
limited
to
a
certain
amount
of
time.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
this
case
it
has
been
some
years,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state's
period
for
coming
in
with
new
evidence
has
been
exhausted
long
before.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
texas
does
have
a
method
by
which
someone
in
herrera's
position
could
ask
for
clemency
or
relief
through
the
governor,
i
guess?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
process
on
the
books
where
that
can
be
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
has
not
been
resorted
to
at
this
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
pending?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
--excuse
me.
exactly
what
is
the
constitutional
rule
you
would
have
this
court
adopt?
it's
not
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
goes
back
to
my
initial
question.
we
don't
have
an
innocent
person
here.
we
have
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
the
murder.
you
have
allegations
coming
up
later
of
new
evidence.
so
in
that
context
what
is
the
rule
you
are
asking
us
to
adopt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just,
just
can
you
tell
me
the
rule
you
would
have
us
adopt,
then
we
can
talk
about
authorities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
texas
allowed
a
new
trial
10
years
later
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
but
went
ahead
and
put
in
all
the
evidence
it
had
before.
would
there
be
enough
evidence
that
would
enable
a
jury
to
return
a
guilty
verdict
again,
notwithstanding
the
new
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
jury
disbelieve
these
late
coming
affidavits
and
continue
to
find
mr.
herrera
guilty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
probably
would
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
whether
on
the
facts
before
us
here
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
judge
to
refuse
a
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
if
faced
with
what
you
have
brought
forward
the
judge
said
i
don't
believe
it,
we're
not
going
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
wouldn't
be
here,
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
district
judge
hadn't
made
that
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
be
here
arguing
this
case
had
judge
hinojosa
turned
it
down?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
a
few--
--has
texas
exercised
the
right
to
grant
clemency
in
a
death
case
in
the
last
15
to
18
years?
