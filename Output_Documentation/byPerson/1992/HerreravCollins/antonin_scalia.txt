justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
don't
we
have
to
consider
how
far
beyond
that
it
reaches?
i
mean,
if
the
argument
you
make
is
valid
surely
it
should
apply
to
everyone
who
is
in
prison
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i
think
one
has
to
consider
how
much
damage
we
do
to
the
system
of
criminal
justice
if
we
apply
it
across
the
board
to
all
prisoners,
no
matter
how
much
after
the
fact
they
choose
to
bring
in
new
evidence
raising
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence.
the
witnesses
from
the
prior
trial
are
dead
or
gone.
the
burden
this
would
put
upon
a
system
of
justice
is
enormous.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
saying
it's
illogical
not
to
ask
for
the
broad
rule.
if
the
principle
of
constitutionality
you're
asserting
is
correct,
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
more
justified
to
keep
someone
in
prison
for
life
than
it
is
to,
than
it
is
to
execute
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
texas
or
any
other
state
is
free
to
adopt
the
rule
you're
arguing
for,
isn't
it,
by
legislation?
i
mean,
they
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
other
states
adopted
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
state
has
adopted
it.
did
it
ever
exist
in
the
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
always
been
in
the
common
law
as
far
as
i
know
a
rule
that
you
must
bring
in
new
evidence
within
a
certain
period,
a
relatively
short
period.
i
think
it
was
30
days,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever
the
period
was.
i
think
it
was.
but
there
has
always
been
such
a
period.
where
do
you
get
this
intuition
that
it
is
unconstitutional?
if
no
state
has
it
now
and
it
has
never
been
the
case
in
the
common
law,
how
have
you
decided
that
it's
unconstitutional?
maybe
you
read
some
of
the
majority
opinions
instead
of
just
the
dissents
and
got
some
of
those
thoughts
about
death
being
different.
[laughter]
what
basis
do
you
have
for
it
other
than
your
intuition?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
disagree
with
the
proposition,
i
take
it,
that
innocence
is
paramount?
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
proposition
we're
supposedly
debating
here.
is
that...
does
texas
not
believe
that
innocence
is
paramount?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
at
issue
here
is
whether
that
proposition
shall
become
a
provision
of
the
federal
constitution,
meaning
that
federal
courts
shall
always
have
to
sit
in
judgment
of
whether
innocence
has
been
adequately
determined.
isn't
that
what
we
have
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
defendant
can
bring
later
educed
evidence
before
the
governor
of
texas?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
this
been
presented
to
him
yet?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
board
of
pardons
were
to
deny
the
request
i
assume
it's
because
the
board
of
pardons
thinks
that
the
individual
is
guilty,
or
not?
if
the
board
of
pardons
believes
that
the
man
is
innocent
are
they
authorized
nonetheless
to
allow
his
execution
to
proceed?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
happen?
