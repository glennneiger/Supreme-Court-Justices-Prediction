justice
david
h.
souter
you
spoke
of
discovery.
what's
the
discovery
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
you've
got
your
newly
discovered
evidence.
what
more
do
you
want
to
discover?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you're
simply
talking
about
a
reinvestigation
de
novo
as
opposed
to
a
proceeding
to
evaluate
the
potential
effect
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
you
want
to
see
if
you
can
find
some
more
newly
discovered
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
you
didn't
have
any
to
begin
with?
would
you
be
entitled
to
some
kind
of
a
reexamination
proceeding
without
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you're
saying
that
there's
some
kind
of
initial
threshold
quantum
of
claimed
newly
discovered
evidence
which
entitles
you
in
effect
to
have
a
new
evidentiary
investigation,
and
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
either
the
common
law
or
the
statutory
proceedings
i
would
suppose
in
most
states
for
the
evaluation
of
newly
discovered
evidence
when
under
the
rules
that
is
an
available
proceeding
for
you
to
bring.
you're
talking
about
something
much
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
critical
to
you
to
have
a
determination
of
the
potential
effect
of
the
newly
discovered
evidence
that
you
have
brought
forward
and
already
proffered
to
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
newly
discovered
evidence
is
no
part
of
your
claim?
that
is
not
essential
to
your
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
evidence
does
not
have
to
be
newly
discovered.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
realize
that,
but
the
rule
that
you
are
urging
us
to
adopt
as
a
constitutional
necessity
does
not
require
a
newly
discovered
evidence
condition.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
griffey,
you
have
made
it
clear,
i
think
you
have
made
it
clear
that
it's
irrelevant
to
your
position
whether
or
not
there
is
any
post
trial
procedure
for
recognizing
newly
discovered
evidence
and
irrelevant
whether
or
not
there
is
any
executive
clemency.
on
your
position
would
it
also
be
constitutionally
irrelevant
whether
or
not
some
kind
of
post
trial
procedure
were
allowed
for
the
litigation
of
constitutional
errors
under
some
circumstances?
in
other
words
could
we
abolish
habeas
completely
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-huh.
can
we
abolish
it
too?
can
we
say
that
congress
would
be
perfectly
free
consistent...
well,
i
suppose
that
begs
the
question,
but
would
habeas
be,
would
federal
habeas
be
irrelevant?
