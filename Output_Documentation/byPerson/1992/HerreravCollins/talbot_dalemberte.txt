mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
of
leonel
herrera
brings
to
the
court
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
with
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence
is
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
before
being
executed
by
the
state.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
we
are
not
challenging
the
conviction
below,
we
are
basing
this
submission
on--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
it's
our
contention
that
he
should
not
be
executed
while
he
has
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence,
but
our
submission
is
based
on
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
does,
your
honor,
although
in
our
submission
the
relief
that
we
request
does
not
seek
complete
justice
at
this
stage.
we
are
just
simply
saying
at
this
stage
that
leonel
herrera
may
not
be
executed
while
he
has
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence.
and
all
we
sought
at
this
stage
is
that
judge
hinojosa
at
the
trial
level
take
evidence
about
our
colorable
claim
of
innocence,
which
he
agreed
to
do,
and
that
process
before
judge
hinojosa
was
aborted
by
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
we
do,
your
honor,
and
ultimately--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
the
eighth
amendment
only
gets
us
step
one.
we
respectfully
submit
that
because
of
the
grounds
of
our
claim
we
in
this
submission
only
ask
that
the
state
not
be
allowed
to
execute
leonel
herrera.
we
recognize
that
that
does
not
reach
a
complete
justice.
it's
really
not
entirely
symmetrical
in
our
judgment.
we
would
like
for
it
to
be
symmetrical.
we
would
like
to
see
at
some
point
a
larger
principle,
but
we
do
not
urge
that
larger
principle
here.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
he
was
found
guilty
by
a
state
court
and
now
a
federal
judge
has
ruled
that
there's
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence
and
has
sought
to
proceed.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
perhaps
there
has
been
some
error
in
that.
the
whole
point
of
this
is
that
the,
is
that
in
order
to
get
to
a
showing
of
innocence
you
have
to
plead
first
of
all
innocence
and
then
a
federal
district
judge
has
to
use
the
various
habeas
procedures
to
act
on
that
claim
of
innocence
and
make
a
determination.
that
whole
process
was
going
forward
before
judge
hinojosa
when
the
fifth
circuit
stopped
the
process.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
i
know
other
states
do.
i
don't
agree
with
the
states
count
in
this,
but
i
think
quite
a
large
number.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
has
been
10
years,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it's
a
30-day
period,
your
honor,
in
texas.
and
the
texas
court
to
whom
we
tried
to
take
this
claim
originally
simply
said
it
was
not
a
claim,
no
jurisdiction
for
that
claim.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
there
is
at
least
a
theoretical
process,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
not--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
your
honor,
we
applied
for
that
process.
we
have
not
had
a
hearing
and
we
have
not
had
clemency.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
perhaps
so,
your
honor.
under
the
texas
rules
it's
not
even
clear
that
we're
entitled
to
be
before
the
texas
board
of
pardons
and
parole.
the
only
way
to
get
there
it
seems
to
me
as
i
read
their
rules
is
that
all
members
of
the
prosecution
team,
that
is
not
just
the
prosecution,
the
prosecutor,
the
sheriff,
and
the
judge
have
to
make
application
and
have
to
agree
to
that
submission,
or
alternatively
there
is
to
be
a
court
judgment
perhaps
supported
by
affidavits.
so
the
possibility
if
we
went
forward
with
this
matter
before
judge
hinojosa
and
got
a
judgment
of
actual
innocence,
that
might
give
us
an
entry
point
to
the
texas
clemency
proceeding.
but
there's
not
any
great
history
of
clemency
or
pardons
being
granted
in
terms
of
either
granting
mercy
or
on
basis
of
innocence
in
texas,
although
there
have
been
texas
cases.
we
know
at
least
randall
dale
adams
where
a
person
was
actually
innocent,
but
that
process
did
not
work
for--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
sir.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
innocence
is
a
value
which
trumps
all
other
time
limits,
and
in
that
i
go
back
to
judge
friendly's
1970
law
review
article
in
which
he
said
that
innocence
ought
to
be
a
paramount
virtue
and
you
have
to
look
at
that--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
in
general,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that's
exactly
the
process
that
ought
to
be
followed,
that
a
judge
ought
to
look
first
of
all
to
see
whether
the
pleading
stage
is
satisfied.
if
so,
then
pick
up
and
look
at
the
case
and
to
look
at
the
case
as
the
federal
habeas
rules
permit,
step
by
step.
judge
hinojosa
was
in
that
process,
and
i
perfectly
well
agree
that
at
some
point
the
district
judge
says
there's
not
enough
here
to
go
forward--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
precisely.
and
judge
hinojosa
was
about
that
process
when
it
was
interrupted.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
no,
your
honor.
any
time
limit
that
cuts...
that's
the
design
of
the
safety
valve
that
this
court
has
talked
about
at
various
times,
justice
white.
and
as
i
look
at
this
history
over
the
years
of
when
we
have
learned
about
actual
innocence
i
think
the
lesson
it
teaches
me
is
that
many
times
we
don't
learn
until
many
years
later
of
actual
innocence.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
appreciate
the
fact
that
a
great
deal
of
the
safety
valve
discussion,
the
discussion
about
miscarriage
of
justice
does
seem
to
be
linked
in
some
way
with
an
underlying
constitutional
claim.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
then
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
i
read
some
of
those
passages
as
indicating
that
a
pure
miscarriage
of
justice
that
would--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--i
did
read
sawyer
carefully,
your
honor,
and
i
understood
that
although
in
our
submission
we
do
not
think
sawyer
directly
controls,
certainly
the
sawyer
decision
adopted
and
promulgated
the
standard
of
kuhlmann,
and
we
believe
that
kuhlmann
controls.
and
i
do
concede
that
there
is,
there
does
seem
to
be
a
connection
between
the
claim
of
innocence
and
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
we
make
this
submission--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
we
don't
think--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--jackson
says
that
on
a
pure,
on
a
review
of
the
original
record
there
is
indeed,
your
honor,
a
standard
to
be
applied.
we
do
not
use
the
jackson
standard,
however,
in
other
habeas
claims.
we
don't
use
it
in
habeas
context.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir,
there
is,
and
i--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
your
honor,
i
believe--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
sir.
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
we
are
prepared
to
meet
the
standard
which
was
announced
in
kuhlmann
case
in
1986,
and
i
believe
adopted
by
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
sawyer
last
term.
and
that
standard,
i
believe,
is
the
standard
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
probability
that
the
original
jury
verdict
was
in
error.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
our
submission
at
this
stage
does
not.
if
i
may
go
back
and--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--it
does
not
because
of
the
history,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
stepped
into
a
process.
and
it's
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
that
says
actual
innocence
is
not
a
ground
for
federal
habeas
that
makes
this
question
so
very
stark
before
this
court.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
it
is
the
rule
that
we
believe
the
court
has
adopted
in
ford.
it's
also
a
rule
that
was
adopted
earlier
in
robinson
v.
california,
and
it's
the
idea
that
our
protections
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
protect
against
anything
that's
barbaric.
we
believe
that
execution
of
someone
who
is
innocent,
execution
of
someone
who
has--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
rule
is
analogous
to
the
rule
announced
in
ford.
we
did
not
know
in
ford
whether
the
person--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--i'm
sorry.
your
honor,
the
rule
that
we
would
suggest
is
the
rule
that
says
that
an
inmate
with
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence
may
not
be
executed
without
provision
for
a
hearing,
due
process
to
determine
the
merits
of
that
claim.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
it
may
well
be,
although
i
do
not
know
what
the
reach
of
the
eighth
amendment
is.
it's
very
clear
to
me
that
something
so
basic
as
executing
a
person
with
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence
is
reached
by
the
eighth
amendment.
now
i'm
not
sure
how
far
beyond
that
it
reaches,
but
it's
pretty
clear
to
me
that
it
reaches
at
least
that
far.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
that's
my
intuition
as
well,
but
our
submission
is
only
on
this
narrow
point.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
first
of
all
we're
not
asking
for
the
very
broad
rule
which
you
suggest
in
your
question.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
and
perhaps,
your
honor,
this
court
will
at
some
point
reach
that,
but
it
need
not
reach
that
point
on
this
submission
because
we
do
maintain,
along
with
earlier
court
decisions,
that
death
is
different
and
that
all
of
the
many
claims
that
the
state
makes
for
all
the
processes
that
might
be
available,
they
are
clearly
not
available
to
someone
who
has
been
executed.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
indeed,
your
honor,
there
was
legislation
that
was
vetoed
by
the
governor
back
in
1984.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
i'm
not
aware
of
the
principle
that
i
now
advocate--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--i
didn't
remember
that
being
in
common
law,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
when
i
read
the
phrases
used
by
this
court
referring
to
miscarriages
of
justice
and
i
began
to
put
in
my
mind
what
is
the
greatest
possible
miscarriage
of
justice,
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
greatest
one
that
i
could
formulate
would
be
the
execution
of
an
innocent
person
or
the
execution
of
a
person
who
had
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence.
you
would
not
want
that
person
to
be
executed
without
hearing
that
case.
and
in
the
same
way,
justice
o'connor,
that
i
do
believe
that
the
idea
that
would
give
a
process
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
person
is
innocent
in
the
same
way
that
would
give
a
process
to
find
out
whether
they
were
insane.
that's
the
reason
i
referred
to
ford.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
based
on
the
record
available
right
now?
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
i--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
of
course
these
affidavits
in
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
would
be
turned
into
extra
witnesses
being
placed
before
a
trial.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
i
think
our
burden
is
to
show
that
a
jury,
based
on
all
the
evidence,
not
just
the
evidence
that
is
judged
by
the
jackson
standard
but
all
the
evidence
judged
under
the
kuhlmann
standard,
would
mean
that
a
jury
probably
would
not
have
reached
that
result,
and
that--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--that's
right.
that's
my
understanding,
that's
my
reading
of
kuhlmann,
your
honor,
quite
directly.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
staged
proceeding
in
much
the
way
that
all
habeas
cases
are,
under
great
control
of
the
federal
district
judge
under
the
habeas
rules.
and
so
it
is
initially
not
a
trial,
it
is
first
of
all
a
review
of
the
pleadings
to
find
out
if
they're
adequate.
and
at
that
point
we
then
come
forward
with
support
for
our
pleadings,
which
we
have
done
in
affidavit
form,
and
that's
the
place
where
we
were
before
we
were
interrupted.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
if
we
win
on
the
hearing
i
was
just
talking
about
then,
your
honor,
we
go
forward,
we'll
get
the
other
discovery
which
we
need
to
have
in
this
case.
recognize
that
we're
investigating,
your
honor--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--oh,
if
we
go
forward
to
the
evidentiary
hearing,
all
the
way
to
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
at
that
point,
your
honor,
if
we
prevail
in
convincing
the
federal
judge
that
we
indeed
are
correct,
there
is
a
claim
of
innocence--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
sir.
at
that
point
all
that
happens
is
what
has
happened
under
ford.
at
that
point--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
sir.
it's
simply
that
the
state
may
not
execute
leonel
herrera.
that's
as
far
as
we
go
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
at
that
point
the
state
simply
may
not
execute
mr.
herrera
in
the
same
way
that
they
may
not
execute
alvin
ford.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
it
may
or
may
not
be.
and
the
reason
i
give
you
that
answer
is
let's
look
at
the
example
of
the
virginia
case
that
came
up
last
term,
the
coleman
case.
the
coleman
case
operated
through
the
system
much
in
the
same
way
that
our
case
has
begun
to
operate
through
the
system,
but
there
was
no
appellate
court
to
sit
in,
step
in
and
cut
off
the
coleman
proceedings.
the
coleman
proceedings
went
forward,
the
judge
looked
at
the
affidavits
and
other
material
and
said
based
on
what
i
see
there
is
no
reason
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
we
think
that
power
still
rests
with
the
federal
district
judge.
he
doesn't
have
to
go
forward
for
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
if
we
make
our
showing
along
the
way.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
they
may,
your
honor,
but
the
state
gets
the
benefit
under
the
rule
that
we
suggest,
essentially
it's
judge
henry
friendly's
rule,
the
state
gets
the
benefit
of
putting
in
the
full
trial
transcript.
they
don't
have
to
retry
the
case.
they
have
the
benefit
of
a
case
which
they
say
was
already
overwhelming.
so
they
get
to
put
that
case
in
and
the
judge
looks
at,
plus
anything
else
the
state
wants
to
put
in,
and
at
that
point
they
get
to
make
the--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--in
essence,
your
honor,
it
is
a,
i
think
it's
more
in
the
nature
of
a
ford
hearing
finding
out
whether
the
state
could
execute
somebody
at
that
time.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
that's
obviously
an
option
for
the
state
if
the
state
wants
to
take
it
back
there,
but
i
do
not
see
that
the
rule
we
advance
compels
the
state
to
do
that.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
the
discovery
is
absolutely
crucial
to
us
in
this
case.
recognize
that
we're
in
the
situation--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
additional
evidence
which
we
have
indicated
in
our
pleadings.
pleading
the
file
with
the
federal
court,
it
was
the
opening
pleading
on
february
13,
told
the
court
about
the
kind
of
problems
we
have
had
in
investigating
this
event,
these
events
in
south
texas.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
we're
talking
about
both,
and
the
record--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
we--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--i
think,
no,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
make
the
threshold
showing
to
a
federal
district
judge,
as
we
have
done
in
this
case,
that
we
are
entitled
to
go
forward.
the
federal
district
judge
was
taking
this
as
the
judge
should,
step
by
step
by
step.
the
first
step
is
to
find
out
whether
we
met
the
pleading
test.
we
did.
the
second
step
is
to
see
whether
we
had
any
evidence
to
support
that
pleading.
we
brought
forward
the
affidavits.
the
next
step
i
believe
is
for
the
federal
district
judge
to
give
us
the
kind
of
protection
from
the,
from
texas
execution,
and
the
kind
of
protections
that
are
contemplated
in
the
habeas
rules
which
i
understand
to
be
the
permission
to
use
the
processes
of
the
court
to
do
an
investigation.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
judge
souter,
i
think
i'm
talking
about
the
thing
that
happens
in
most
habeas
proceedings.
the
judge
has
discretion
to
allow
us
to
take
the
discovery.
and
the
reason
that
i
linger
on
the
point
in
my
colloquy
with
you
is
that
this
is
absolutely
critical
to
us.
understand
what
is
going
on
in
south
texas.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
because
that's
an
incomplete
record,
your
honor.
the
district
judge
wasn't
even,
had
just
begun
to
deal
with
this.
this
was
interrupted
by
the
state
and
by
the
fifth
circuit
at
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding,
not
at
the
completion.
this
isn't
a
full
habeas
record
we've
got.
the
state
stepped
in
and
the
fifth
circuit
stepped
in
and
stopped
this
process
of
the--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--absolutely,
judge,
justice
stevens.
in
fact
that
was
an
option
that
was
available
to
judge
hinojosa.
it
was
the
option
available
to
the
judge
who
sat
on
kuhlmann.
the
difficulty
with
this
case
is
we
stopped
a
process
which
is
rational.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
actually
i
did
reread
the
trial
judge's
order
in
that
case
and
i
thought
that
the
standard
applied
by
the
trial
judge
in
kuhlmann
was
the
kuhlmann
standard
from
the
1986
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
and
i
believe
that
that's
the
probability
standard,
and
that's
the
standard,
i
believe,
that
judge
friendly
framed
in
his
1970
article
and
has
been
adopted
by
the--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--your
honor,
if
it's
a
claim
of,
if
it's
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--yes,
sir.
i
believe
he
later--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--and
because
innocence
is
a
paramount
value,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
it's
the
beginning
point
of
our
claim.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you,
i
thought
his
question
was
hypothetical.
i
thought
you
were
asking
about
my
claim.
leonel
herrera's
claim
has
evidence.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
we
believe
if
it's
going
to
be
a
safety
valve
and
if
it's
going
to
apply
anywhere
it
ought
to
apply
in
context
of
death
cases,
and
we
believe
that
innocence
is
such
a
paramount
value
that
opportunity
to
prove
innocence
should
be
open
to--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
your
honor,
only
if
the
district
judge
finds
that
there's
a
colorable
claim.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
yes,
sir.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
give
the
negative
answer.
all
we
suggest
is
it
goes
before
a
judge
who
uses
it
at
his
discretion.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
then,
your
honor,
thank
you
for
phrasing
the
question
that
way
because
the
rule
we
advocate
is
a
rule
which
permits
a
judge
in
his
discretion
to
hear
the
case,
and
the
rule
that
we
suggest
guides
the
discretion
are
the
rules
already
established
by
this
court
and
the
rules
that
worked
perfectly
well
in
the
kuhlmann
case.
and
the
rule
is,
first
of
all
for
pleading
stage
we
can
go
to
blackledge
as
to
determination
of
the
case.
after
the
full
submission
we
look
to
the
kuhlmann
standard.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
may
i,
may
i
make
the
point
that
on
our
original
submission
before
judge
hinojosa
we
did
in
fact
have
other
constitutional
error.
it's
only
because
judge
hinojosa
found
those
abused
in
his
application
of
mccleskey,
and
we
think
that
may
have
been
in
error.
but
there
was
a
chance,
if
the
case
had
stayed
before
judge
hinojosa,
for
judge
hinojosa
to
correct
that
error
when
he
found
that
our
claim
of
innocence
was
indeed
valid
to
then
let
us
proceed
on
claims
2
through
5.
so
just
to
make
clear,
that
was
not
our
original
submission.
we
only
got
in
this
posture
because
of
hinojosa's
ruling
about
mccleskey
and
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
i
do
not
submit
that
it
would
be
an
abuse.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
your
honor,
i
think
a
district
judge
might
look
at
the
full
record
and
make
a
determination
that
we
do
not
have
enough
at
this
point
or
some
later
point.
judge
hinojosa,
who
lives
in
the
valley,
been
there
since
1983,
believes
that
we
do
have
enough
and
asked
us,
and
gave
us
permission
to
come
forward
and
make
further
demonstration.
and
the
further
demonstration,
in
answer
to
judge
souter,
was
to
get
the
processes
of
the
court
to
be
able
to
look
at
law
enforcement
misconduct.
that's
just
so
hard
to
get
at.
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
we
believe
that
the
district
judge
looked
at
our
evidence--
mr.
talbot
d'alemberte
--no,
if
the
district
judge
had
thrown
us
out
we
would
not
be
urging
that
the
limited
rule
necessary
for
the
court
is
the
rule
that
says
a
judge
may
entertain
our
claim.
