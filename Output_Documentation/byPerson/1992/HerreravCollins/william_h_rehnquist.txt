chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-7328,
leonel
torres
herrera
v.
james
a.
collins.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk.
the
court
remains
in
session.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
d'alemberte.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
innocence
in
the
sense
that
he
didn't
commit
the
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
does
go
to
the
guilt
and
not
just
the
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
safety
valve
this
court
has
talked
about,
mr.
d'alemberte,
is
in
connection
with
a
claim
of
innocence
that
is
traceable
to
some
constitutional
violation.
it
isn't
just
a
free-standing
claim
of
innocence.
you're
asking
for
something
quite
different
than
what
we
provided
for
example
in
sawyer
as
a
basis
for
defeating
the
claim
of
abuse
of
the
writ.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
just
seem
to
be,
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
read
sawyer
against
whitley?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
would
abrogate
that
in
your
submission?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
your
submission
does
not
require
that
that
error
be
traced
to
any
federal
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
you're
answered
my
question.
it
does
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
full
scale
trial
before
the
federal
judge,
or
does
he
just
examine
affidavits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
has
to,
the
state
has
to
impose
some
new
sentence
then,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
they--
--the
evidentiary
hearing
that
you're
talking
about
before
the
federal
judge,
this
is
the
testimony
of
witnesses,
i
take
it,
just
as
you
would
have
had
in
the
original
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
somewhere
down
the
line
if
the
judge
thinks
otherwise
there
is
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
and
at
that
full
evidentiary
hearing
all
the
witnesses
that
testified
at
the
trial
i
suppose
testify
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
d'alemberte.
ms.
griffey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that,
the
third
way
can
be,
it
can
be
submitted
to
the
clemency
board
or
whatever
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
request
of
the
defendant
and
the
defendant's
counsel
in
a
capital
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
griffey.
mr.
larkin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
