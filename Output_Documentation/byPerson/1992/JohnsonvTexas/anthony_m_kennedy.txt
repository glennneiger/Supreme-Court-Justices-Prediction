justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
young
man,
mr.
tigar,
had
tragedies
in
his
early
adolescence.
his
mother
was
killed
and
his
sister
murdered
i
think,
and
it
caused
him
severe
problems.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
might
even
be
more
relevant
than
youth
per
se
to
a
reasoned
moral
judgment,
if
that
is
indeed
a
constitutional
requirement.
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
you
focus
your
argument
on
youth,
and
i
suppose
what
i'm
getting
to
is
that
in
all
of
the
cases
that
we've
had...
held
for
this
case
that's
being
argued
today,
some
22
cases,
there
are
factors
such
as
this.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
arguing
for
is
ultimately
going
to
be
that
there
should
be
a
general
instruction
on
mitigating
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
justice
kennedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
trying
to
see
if
our
decision
can
be
so
limited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
evidence
was
introduced
in
this
case
and
counsel
is
not
confined
at
all
in
their
closing
arguments.
and
my
question
is
why
is
youth,
under
your
submission
in
this
case,
any
different
than
these
other
tragic
instances
that
we've
adverted
to
and
that
are
present
in
this
case
and
so
many
other
capital
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
is
this
youth
in
this
regard
different
from
a
tragic
occurrence
during
adolescence?
what's
the
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
connection,
i
was
interested
in
reading
ex
parte
mathis
where
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
does
say
that
future
dangerousness
is
a
fact.
it
says
ultimate
fact.
was
this
a
new
insight
by
the
texas
court
or
a
new
limitation
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
this
is
not
a
teague
case
anyway.
i
wasn't
thinking
about
it
in
that
connection.
but
it
does...
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
an
insight
that
it
has
come
to
after
examining
many
of
its
cases.
this
is
just
a
factual
determination,
which
it
seems
to
be
somewhat
inconsistent
with
reasoned
moral
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
the
cases
must
be
read
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
answers
to
justice
souter,
were
you
making
the
assumption
that
in
its
deliberations
and
in
giving
its
answer
with
reference
to
special
issue
2,
the
jury
was
making
a
reasoned
moral
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it
underlies
it,
the
jury
was
then
exercising
in
your
view
a
reasoned
moral
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
statement
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
the
jury
in
answering
question
number
2
is
making
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that
factual
assessments,
factual
assumptions
underlie
many
reasoned
moral
judgments,
but
isn't
there
an
element
of
judgment...
i
think
you
used
the
word
merciful
earlier...
an
element
of
judgment
that
is
different
than
simply
a
factual
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
factual
determinations
are
reasoned
moral
judgments?
is
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
accept?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
in
blystone
the
jury
weighed
the
aggravating
and
the
mitigating
factors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view
under
texas
law,
would
the
defendant
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
in
answering
issue
2,
the
jury
is
to
exercise
its
reasoned
moral
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
inherent,
would
he
be
entitled
to
that
instruction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
error
for
the
judge
not
to
give
that
instruction
and
to
tell
the
jury
that
when
it
answers
question
2,
it's
making
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
statute
that
texas
has
amended,
the
present
texas
death
penalty
statute,
give
an
independent
life
option
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
how
you
would
interpret
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
were
in
the
legislature,
is
there
any
way
you
could
accommodate
mr.
tigar's
objection
in
this
case
without
giving
an
independent
life
option?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
objection
in
this
case
that
youth
should
be
considered
more
extensively
than
it
was
as
a
mitigating
factor.
is
there
any
way
you
could
draft
a
statute
to
accommodate
that
concern
without
creating
a
so-called
independent
life
option?
