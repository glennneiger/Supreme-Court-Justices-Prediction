justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you?
you've
answered
it,
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
on
the
question
of
what
the
special
issue
2
means
when
it
asks
is
there
a
probability
that
the
defendant
would
commit
criminal
acts
of
violence
that
would
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
what
period
of
time
and
what
conditions
does
that
refer
to?
does
it
refer
to
conduct
in
prison,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
doesn't
refer
as
i
thought...
i
thought
you
suggested
to
justice
scalia
it
referred
to
conduct
after
being
released
from
prison
only.
no.
it
refers
to
what
he
might
immediately
do
even
in
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
that's
what
a
lawyer
may
argue,
but
what
does
the
instruction
mean
to
the
jury?
what
do
you
think?
is
the
jury
permitted
to
consider
probable
conduct
10
days
after
he
goes
to
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
jury
came
back
to
the
judge
and
said
we
think
if
he's
kept
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
he
would
not
be
a
continuing
threat,
but
if
he
were
released
tomorrow,
he
would
be
a
continuing
threat?
which
is
the
right
view
of
how
we
answer
the
question?
how
should
we
answer
the
question?
what
would
the
judge
tell
the
jury?
say
i
don't
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
figure
it
out
either
way
you
want
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
gives
meaningful
guidance
as
to
whether
the
man
should
be
put
to
death
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
still
like
to
know--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no.
i
would
still
like
to
have
you
tell
me,
because
i'm
not
as
familiar
as
some
of
the
others
are,
why
is
the
morgan
case
relevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
question,
mr.
tigar.
if
we
were
to
attach
significance
to
reasoned
moral
response,
would
that
permit
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
same
category
of
cases
that
was
permissible
at
the
time
furman
was
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
for
rape,
for--
