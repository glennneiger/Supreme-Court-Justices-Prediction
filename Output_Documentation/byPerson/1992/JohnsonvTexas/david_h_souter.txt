justice
david
h.
souter
mrs.
parker,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
and
it...
what
i'm
going
to
put
to
you
is
what,
in
a
very
summary
fashion
i
think
is
the
argument
in
the
as-applied
sense
here,
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
or
if
i'm...
or
if
there
is
a
legal
flaw
in
it.
as
i
understand
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
it
is
if
you
start
with
the
assumption
that
you're
going
to
keep
lockett
and
eddings
and
saffle,
secondly,
if
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
concluded
in
this
case
that
johnson
was
at
least
mature
enough
to
have
satisfied
the
deliberateness
criterion,
and
likewise
that
he
was
still
young
enough
so
that
for
some
period
in
the
future...
i
don't
know...
a
couple
of
years,
3,
4,
5
years...
the
kind
of
youthful
lack
of
judgment
could
continue
to
be
a
dangerous
factor,
then
on
those
three
premises,
in
effect,
the
jury
would
be
in
a
bind,
given
the
instructions
they
got,
because
there
would,
on
the
one
hand,
be
an
obligation
to
give
mitigating
effect
to
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
but
that
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
there
would
have
been
no
way
to
do
it
because
the
so-called
mitigating
evidence
could
not
have
been
considered
in
any
way
favorable
to
the
defendant
under
deliberateness
and
could
only
have
been
considered
as
a...
as
an
aggravating
factor
on
the
question
of
future
dangerousness.
and
i
think
his
argument
simply
is
that
in
this
case,
this
kind
of
case...
this
is
an
example
of
it...
there's
no
way
that
the
so-called
mitigating
evidence
of
youthful
impetuousness
or
bad
judgment
could
have
been
considered
for
a
mitigating
purpose
and
could
have
been
given
the
so-called
reasoned
moral
treatment
for
that
purpose.
do
you
understand
that
to
be
his
argument?
and
if
it
is,
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
you
know
i
may
have
misspoken
there.
what
a
juror
reasonably
could
be
expected
to
do
on
the
evidence
of
the
case.
i
think
you're
right
on
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it...
isn't
the
proper
way
to
apply
it
that
if
the
jury
was
reasonably
likely
to
view
the
evidence
in
the
way
that
i
think
mr.
tigar
is
suggesting,
i.e.,
as
certainly
in
no
way
contrary
to
the
deliberateness
of
the
act,
and
as
also
indicating
under
the
second
issue
a
continuing
youthfulness
for
some
period
of
time,
which
imports
danger
with
it,
if
those
two
conclusions
were
reasonably
likely,
then
there's
no
way
they
could
consider
it
for
a
mitigating
purpose.
isn't
that
the
proper
way
to
apply
the
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how...
in
other
words,
why
is
he
wrong
when
he
assumes
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
view
it
as
aggravating
rather
than
mitigating?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
there's
no
question
we
would
all
agree
that
it
can
be
seen
in
that
way.
but
isn't
the
question
here
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
treated
it
as,
in
fact,
aggravating,
and
if
the
reasonable
jury
did
treat
it
as
aggravating,
which
is
possible
i
assume
on
this
record,
then
it
could
not
have
given
any
mitigating
effect?
and
his
argument
is
they
simply
should
have
had
that
option.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
was
the
jury
instructed
on
that
in
this
case?
was
the
jury
given
any
instruction
on...
to
explain
what
you
have
just
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
the
jury
didn't
know
how
to
interpret
it.
i
mean,
it
was
open
to
the
jury
to
interpret
it
any
way
it
could
reasonably
do
given
the
basic
language.
and
if
the
jury
had
interpret...
if
a
reasonable
juror
had
said
i
guess
what
they're
getting
at
by
this
second
question
is
whether
for
any
period
of
time
starting
today
and
going
into
the
future
he
would
continue
to
be
dangerous
and
would
continue
to
be
dangerous
in
part
because
of
his
youthfulness,
then
i
would
count
youthfulness
as
an
aggravating
factor.
and
that
was...
i
assume
that
kind
of
an
interpretation
was
certainly
open
to
a
reasonable
juror
given
the
instructions
and
given
the
evidence.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
long...
i
didn't
mean...
i'm
sorry.
i
shouldn't
have
interrupted
you,
but
as
long
as
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
done
that,
then
wasn't
a
further
instruction
required
because
if
the
reasonable
juror
had
done
that,
wholly
consistently
with
the
court's
instructions,
then
the
juror
would
have
been
in
the
position,
consistent
with
those
instructions,
of
being
unable
to
give
any
mitigating
effect
even
if
on
a
proper
instruction
mitigating
effect
could
have
been
given?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
when
you
speak
of
giving
effect
to
both
edges,
don't
we
usually
premise
everything
we
say
about
jury
instructions
on
the
assumption
that
if
a
juror
could
reasonably
view
the
evidence
in
one
of
two...
in
either
of
two
ways,
that
the
juror
has
got
to
be
given
instructions
as
to
the
legal
significance
of
viewing
it
one
way
and
the
legal
significance
of
viewing
it
the
other?
and
if
in
a
case
like
this,
the
jury...
a
reasonable
juror
might
have
said,
gee,
i
think
this
is
aggravating,
he'll
do
it
again
in
another
couple
of
years,
or
a
reasonable
juror
might
have
said,
no,
i
think
in
the
long
run
he
is
going
to
outgrow
it,
so
it's
mitigating,
if
reasonable
jurors
could
have
viewed
it
either
way,
the
normal
rule
would
be
to
give
them
legal
instructions
as
to
what
effect
to
give
the
total
evidence
depending
on
which
way
they
saw
it.
they
didn't
get
instructions
on
the
two
alternatives
that
were
open
to
them.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
could
only
consider
it...
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
they
could
only
consider
it
for
the
purpose
of
answering
these
two
questions.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
reasonable
juror
said
i
regard
this
as
an
aggravating
factor
in
the
sense
that
the...
under
the
second
question,
in
the
sense
that
i
think
this
person
is
going
to
remain
impetuous
for
a
few
years
and
he's
likely
to
do
it
again,
then
the
juror
could
not,
under...
or
i
was
going
to
say
under
the
instruction...
under
the
lack
of
instruction,
have
said
but
i
still
think
i
ought
to
give
a
mitigating
significance
to
the
youth.
that's
the
thing
that
he
couldn't
have
done
unless
he
was
behaving
irrationally.
i
suppose
we...
it's
always
possible
that
a
juror
might
be
irrational,
but
we
can't
base
our
law
on
that.
so,
if
the
juror
had
said,
no,
this
is
aggravating,
the
juror
could
not
consistently
with
those
questions
have
given
it
a...
any
other
or
different
mitigating
effect.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
have
been
proper
for
counsel
to
argue
in
the
terms
of
this
statement?
if
you,
the
jury,
find
that
johnson's
youth
was
an
aggravating
factor
so
that
you
conclude
that
he
is
more
likely
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future
for
some
period
of
time
as
a
result
of
his
youth
and
you
so
answer
the
second
question
that
he
will
be
dangerous
in
the
future,
you
may
still
in
some
way
give
effect
to
the
mitigating
character
of
his
youth.
would
that
have
been
a
proper
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
a
juror
had...
and
i
suppose
this
isn't
possible,
but
if
a
juror
had
said
please
tell
me
how,
what
would
the
answer
have
been?
the
jury
has
got
to
return
answers
to
two
questions,
the
deliberateness
question
and
the
future
dangerousness
question.
that's
all
the
jury
can
do,
as
i
understand
it.
so,
how
would
the
juror,
on
the
view
of
the
evidence
i
have
just
expressed,
have
given
the
mitigating
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
it
will
be.
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
juror
can
reasonably
say,
look,
he's
going
to
be
very
dangerous
for
another
3
or
4
years
until
he
gets
older.
and
therefore
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
yes,
he
is
going
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
but
i
happen
to
think,
even
though
he
is
dangerous,
he
shouldn't
get
the
death
penalty
here
because
he
was
young
when
he
committed
the
act.
i
don't
see
how
the
juror
could
give...
in
any
way
give
vent
to
that
final
conclusion
consistently
with
his
answers
to
the
two
questions.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
jurors...
i
mean,
that
is
a
reasonable
way
for
the
jurors
to
interpret
the
question,
isn't
it?
you
say,
well,
they
don't
have
to.
they
might
have
read
the
question
a
different
way,
but
if
that's
a
reasonable
way
for
them
to
interpret
the
question,
it's
consistent
with
any
instruction
or
lack
of
instruction,
they
say
he
is
going
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future,
but
i
happen
to
think
because
he
was
young,
he
shouldn't
get
the
death
penalty,
there's
no
way
they
can
express
that
last
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
supreme...
does
the
court
of
texas
criminal
appeals
agree
with
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
doesn't
the
court...
maybe
i'm
again
mis...
doesn't
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
say
that
one
way
to
consider...
one
possible
interpretation
of
youth
as
to
dangerousness
is
its
aggravating
effect
over
the
short
term?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
what
it
said
in
zimmerman,
that
that's
one
way
to
consider
this
evidence
under
the
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
a
slight
variation
on
it?
what
if
the
jurors
came
back
to
the
judge
and
said
we
find
that
there's
a
very
high
likelihood
that
this
impetuous
individual
will
kill
again
on
slight
provocation.
if
he
is
sentenced
to
prison,
we
think
there's
a
serious
likelihood
that
he's
going
to
commit
a
murder
in
prison.
may
we,
consistently
with
that
conclusion
of
ours,
answer
the
second
question
yes,
that
he
will
be
dangerous
in
the
future?
would
the
judge
say
that
is
an
option
that
you
have?
in
other
words,
that
would
be
a
fair
answer
to
the
question.
or
would
he
say,
no,
you
may
not
return
a
yes
answer
to
the
question
on
that
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
would...
so,
they
would
have
the
option
to
return
a
yes
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
a
utilitarian,
moral
response?
in
other
words,
isn't
it
a
moral
judgment
by
the
jury
about
what
ought
to
be
done
rather
than
a
moral
conclusion
by
the
jury
about
the
moral
character
of
the
defendant
or
his
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
have
to
admit
i
don't
understand
the
second
question.
