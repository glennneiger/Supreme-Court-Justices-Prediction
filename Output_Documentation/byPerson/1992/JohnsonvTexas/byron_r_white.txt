you'll
understand
that
when
you
get
a
little
older.
[laughter]
and,
mr.
tigar,
could
i
ask
you
with
this
open-ended
question
that
you
say
every
state
presents
to
the
jury,
do
you
think
there's
any
real
likelihood
that
you
would
be
up
here
arguing
some
day
that...
making
the
same
argument
that
prevailed
in
furman,
that
there's
really...
that
everything
is
up
for
grabs
for
the
jury
and
there's
no
real
way
to
know
how
a
jury
operates?
reasoned
moral
judgement.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
will
not.
you
will
not
ever
come
up
here
making
that
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
somebody
may
not
hire
you.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
made
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
furman
in
favor
of
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
had
been
writing
a
law
journal
article
as
a
professor?
would
you
have
said
that's
the...
that
is
the
result
that
should
obtain
in
furman?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you,
and
you
should.
as
you
should
as
a
good
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
flattery
is
a
great
thing.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
my
intent.
[laughter]
