ms.
dana
e.
parker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
johnson,
indeed,
does
not
ask
the
court
to
overrule
jurek
v.
texas.
he
instead
asks
the
court
to
gut
it
and
let
it
die
without
further
comment.
to
accomplish
this,
johnson
proposes
an
unprecedented
rule,
one
that
would
require
the
state
to
provide
an
independent
life
option,
despite
the
fact
that
proffered
mitigating
evidence
maybe
both
considered
and
given
mitigating
weight
under
the
special
issues.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
i
do
understand
that
to
be
his
argument,
your
honor,
and
it
is
incorrect
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
question
what
a
juror
or
jury
could
have
done
is
not
the
pertinent
inquiry
under--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--yes,
your
honor.
what
the
jury
was
reasonably
likely
to
do,
how
the
jury
was
reasonably
likely
to
interpret
its
instructions.
that
inquiry
goes
to
whether
the
jury
was
precluded
as
a
matter
of
law
from
giving
any
mitigating
weight
to
the
evidence.
that
is
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
i
think
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
how
this
court
has
recognized
that
jurors
are
likely
to
view
their
instructions,
and
that
in
this
type
of
case,
where
the
evidence
does
possess
mitigating
relevance
to
the
second
issue,
and
where
jurors--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--i
think
there
are...
that
premise
is
legally
incorrect
for
two
reasons,
the
first
being
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
in
zimmerman.
in
zimmerman,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals...
this
is
an
as
yet
unpublished
opinion,
your
honor,
but
on
the
very
same
page
that
is
cited
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
12,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
stated
that
youth
can
be
seen
as
mitigating
because
maturity
often
coincides
with
age.
a
jury
might
be
merciful
toward
a
young
defendant
in
the
belief
the
defendant
could
live
a
productive
life
after
an
extended
period
of
incarceration.
this--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--no,
your
honor.
the
jury
could
still
give
the
mitigating
effect
to
that
evidence.
it
is
precisely
to
the
extent
that
youth
may
reflect
a
reduced
culpability
in
the
sense
that
he
is
immature
or
impulsive,
that
that
evidence
equally
indicates
that
he
will
not
pose
a
future
danger.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
stated
that
it's
whether
the
defendant
would
continue
to
commit
criminal
acts
of
violence
so
as
to
constitute
a
continuing
threat
whether
in
or
out
of
prison.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
a
hypothetical
juror
certainly
could
view
it
that
way,
but
that
is
not--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--again,
your
honor,
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
reasonable
likelihood
standard.
that
standard--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--that
is
precisely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
particularly
true
in
a
case
where
the
jury
believes
that
the
crime
is
attributable
to
a
mitigating
aspect
of
youth
and
that
that
defendant,
precisely
to
that
extent,
is
likely
not
to
pose
a
future
danger.
that
is
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
recognized
in
zimmerman.
and
certainly
nothing
in
the
constitution
requires
that
the
jury
view
evidence
only
as
a
mitigating
or
give
it
only
mitigating
effect.
the
court
recognized
this
in
the
context
of
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
berger
v.
kemp.
the
problem
in
penry
was
not
that
the
jury
was
free
to
choose
whether
to
view
the
evidence
as
aggravating
or
mitigating
or
that
it
could
give
effect
to
both
edges
in
the
context
of
answering
the
special
issues.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
your
honor,
they
were
instructed
not
in
that
regard,
but
they
were
instructed
that
they
could
consider
all
of
the
evidence
whether
aggravating
or
mitigating.
and
under
the
reasonable
likelihood
standard,
a
jury
is--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--that
is
correct,
and
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
reflects,
the
jury
could
give
mitigating
effect
to
johnson's
youth
precisely
as
the
evidence
was
presented
and--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--no,
your
honor.
again,
i
think
the
jury
or
the
juror
could
weigh
both
aspects
of
it
with
respect
to
the
special
issues.
these
terms,
as
you
have
recognized
are
not
defined.
they
have
a
common
sense
core
meaning.
nothing
requires
the
jury
to
view
the
second
special
issue
in
the
manner
that
you
describe.
both
sides
were
free
to
argue
precisely
how
the
evidence
supported
an
answer
to
that
issue
that
was
favorable
to
them,
and--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--for
defense
counsel
to
make?
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
be
because--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--your
honor,
because
the
question
not
only
asks
about
continuing
criminal
acts
of
violence,
but
whether
that
would
render
this
defendant
a
continuing
threat
to
society,
and
nothing--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
again
is
that
nothing
requires
the
jurors
to
take
that
narrow
a
view
of
the
special
issues
and
that--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--again,
boyde
makes
it
clear
that
the
reasonable
likelihood
standard
does
not
assume
that
jurors
will
pick
from
among
various
interpretations
of
their
instructions
the
one
that
will
render
the
presentation
of
mitigating
evidence
and
the
punishment
phase
a
nullity.
and
that
is
precisely
what
that
hypothetical
is
premised
on.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
and
that
is--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--i
would
agree
with
you
there,
your
honor.
it
is
very
unlikely--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
stated
that
society
does
encompass
prison.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
in
zimmerman.
in
zimmerman,
the
court
stated
that,
for
example,
youth
might
be
considered
as
aggravating
because
the
defendant
would
use
his
remaining
years
to
continue
in
a
life
of
crime.
that
same
thing
may
be
said
about
a
defendant
of
any
age.
the
fact
that
a
35-year
old
defendant
would
use
his
continuing
years
in
that
fashion
would
not
transform
the
biological
fact
that
he
is
35
years
old
or
the
age
of
35
years
into
an
aggravating
factor.
that
is
much
more
properly
viewed
a
reflection
of
character
and
not
of
age
and
not
of
the
limitations
of
youth.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
i
think
that
that
underlies
the
jury's
answer
to
that
special
issue.
it
affects
the
weight
that
the
jury
gives
particular
evidence.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--i
think
it
has
always
been
recognized
that
the
special
issues
are
factual
issues,
that
they
are
factual
in
nature,
and
that
a
jury
or
jurors
must
be
able
to
answer
those
issues
without
conscious
distortion
or
bias.
but
there
is
a
range
of
discretion
and
judgment
consistent
with
those
issues
being
factual
ones.
it
is
precisely
for
this
reason
that
witherspoon
applies
to
texas.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
because
these
issues--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--they
are
in
this
case.
the
court
recognized
this
in
adams
v.
texas.
the
plurality
recognized
this
in
franklin
v.
lynaugh,
and
even
the
dissenting
justices
in
blystone
recognized
that
in
answering
the
special
issues,
because
they
are
the
ultimate
sentencing
issues,
that
the
jury,
in
fact,
does
make
a
moral
judgment
about
this
defendant
and
about
his
crime.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor,
but
a
finding
that
aggravation
outweighs
mitigation
is
no
more
or
no
less
utilitarian
than
an
answer
to
these
special
issues.
a
jury
in
pennsylvania,
for
example,
would
not
be
free
to
return
a
sentence
less
than
death
if
it
honestly
believed
that
the
aggravation
outweighed
the
mitigation,
but
nonetheless,
a
jury
in
pennsylvania
is
not
required
to
have
an
independent
life
option
independent
of
its
weighing
of
the
evidence
according
to
the
state
statute.
these
issues
in
texas
i
think
very
importantly
must
be
proven
by
the
state
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
a
wide
range
of
evidence,
both
aggravating
and
mitigating,
is
relevant
to
the
issues,
and
because
they
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
state
certainly
does
not
require
that
the
jury
give
much
weight
to
the
evidence
before
it
can
answer
a
special
issue
no.
unlike
the
typical
enumerated
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
that
are
used
in
pure
balancing
states,
texas
does
not
require
the
jury
to
find
the
existence
of
preliminary
facts
before
it
can
then
proceed
to
weigh
those
factors
in
deciding
the
ultimate
issues.
the
catchall
in
blystone,
for
example,
is
merely
a
vehicle
by
which
evidence
can
make
its
way
into
the
actual
weighing
process,
into
the
process
that
is
dispositive
of
punishment.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
that
it
would.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
there
is
nothing
about
the
issue
that
requires
the
jury
to
view
it
that
way,
and
as
defense
counsel
argued
in
this
case,
society
should
be
viewed
to
exclude
prison
and
that
the
jury
should
consider
only
what
johnson
might
do
20
or
40
years
down
the
road.
this--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--that
is
certainly
a
factor
that
is
relevant
to
the
jury's
assessment
of
that
issue.
it
is
not
necessarily
dispositive
of
that
question,
and
this
play
in
the
issues--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--i
believe
that
in
all
likelihood
he
probably
would
tell
the
jury
that
they--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--yes,
that...
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
term
was
not
defined.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
that
is
merely
within
the
jury's
range
of
discretion
and
judgment
about
the
issues.
there
is...
it
certainly
is
not
a
very
wide
one,
and
it
is
certainly
very
unlikely
that
a
jury
passing
upon
the
fate
of
the
particular
defendant
would
choose
that
type
of
an
interpretation
of
the
instructions.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
i
do
not
believe
that
the
judge
would
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
not
accept
that
assessment.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor,
precisely
depending
upon
their
view
of
the
evidence
and
whether
it
is,
in
fact,
mitigating
or
aggravating.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor.
not...
i
do
not
believe
to
that
extent
that
the
judge
would
be
able
to
tell
the
jury
specifically
in
that
regard
how
to
precisely
view
the
evidence
in
the
context
of
these
issues.
trial
judges
are
authorized...
they
are
not
required...
to
define
terms
in
the
issues.
in
this
case--
ms.
dana
e.
parker
--yes,
your
honor.
johnson
asked
for
an...
a
definition
of
deliberately
that
was,
in
fact,
much
narrower
than
the
definition
that
he
urged
the
jury
to
accept
at
the
punishment
phase.
depending
on
the
jury's
assessment
of
the
evidence,
it
was
free
to
accept
johnson's
argument
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
that
issue.
johnson
did
not
request
any
vehicle
or
instruction
by
which
the
jury
could
measure
his
culpability
independent
of
the
issues.
he
requested
that
the
judge
direct
the
jury
to
consider
mitigating
evidence,
and
the
judge
granted
that
instruction
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
does
not
require
that
the
instruction
be
given.
the
future
dangerousness
question,
your
honor,
encompasses
a
wide
range
of
factors
that
do
pertain
to
the
defendant's
culpability.
that
is
merely
an
assessment
that
is
made
when
the
jury
weighs
the
evidence,
for
the
jury,
as
here,
typically
is
instructed
that
it
is
free
to
give
the
evidence
whatever
weight
it
deems
appropriate.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
i
think
that
is
inherent
in
answering
the
special
issues.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
necessary.
juries
in
pennsylvania
do
not
have
to
be
told
that
a
reasoned
moral
judgment
must
underlie
their
weighing
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be.
despite
the
factual
nature
of
that
inquiry,
there
is
a
moral
quality
that
is
inherent
in
the
ultimate
issues
of
any
capital
sentencing
scheme
here.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor.
it
is
no
more
utilitarian
than
a
mere
balancing
or
weighing
of
aggravation
and
mitigation.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
again,
consistent...
so
long
as
jurors
do
not
consciously
distort
the
inquiries
to
the
issues,
they
are
free,
depending
on
their
view
of
the
evidence,
to
give
that
evidence
mitigating
effect
under
the
issue
so
long
as
the
evidence
possesses
mitigating
relevance
to
the
special
issues,
which
was
true
of
johnson's
youth
as
proffered
in
this
case,
for
it
was
proffered
for
no
purpose
other
than
the
special
issues.
the
jury
is
provided
with
an
adequate
procedural
vehicle
by
which
to
give
effect
to
the
evidence.
the
constitution
does
not
require
an
independent
life
option
by
which
the
jury
can
say
that
for
whatever
reason
the
death
penalty
is
not
appropriate.
the
proper
view
and
the
proper
analysis
of
reduced
culpability
with
respect
to
the
texas
special
issues
is
the
broad
rule
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
en
banc
in
graham
v.
collins.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
does.
and
again,
that
was
not
a
statute
that
was
scripted
by
our
office.
ms.
dana
e.
parker
with
mr.
tigar's
view
of
culpability?
ms.
dana
e.
parker
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
possible
with
the
overly
expansive
reading
of
penry
that
he
has
taken
and
with
the
all-encompassing
view
of
culpability
that
is
advocated
here
and
was
advocated
in
graham
v.
collins.
the
firth
circuit
identified
the
aspect
of
culpability
and
reduced
culpability
that
this
court
said
posed
the
potential
for
problems
under
the
texas
statute
where
evidence
of
a
reduced
culpability,
where
the
major
mitigating
thrust
of
the
evidence
shows
a
reduced
culpability,
and
that
evidence
is
mitigating
under
the
special
issues...
thank
you,
your
honor.
