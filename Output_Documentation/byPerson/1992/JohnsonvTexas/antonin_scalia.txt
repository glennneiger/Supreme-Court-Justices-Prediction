excuse
me,
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
legal
tradition
you
were
referring
to
that
extended
to
25,
that's
a
legal
tradition
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that
relate
to
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
or
to
the
age
of
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
description
of
what
the
texas
courts
hold
these
factors
to
be,
namely,
narrow,
factual
inquiries,
suggests
to
me
that...
although
you
purport
to
be
making
only
an
as-applied
challenge,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
accept
that
description,
this
scheme
is
invalid.
maybe
it's
the
same
question
that
justice
kennedy
is
asking.
if
we
accept
your
description
of
the
texas
system,
this
is
invalid
in
all
cases,
not
just
for
youth.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
proffitt
didn't...
i
mean,
we
had
never
accepted
the
proposition
that
the
state
inquiry
was
a
narrow,
factual
inquiry
of
whether
there
was,
as
you
say
there
is
in
this
case,
premeditation
or
deliberateness.
there
either
is
or
isn't.
and
what
do
you
say?
two
blinks
of
an
eye
or
something--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
i
mean,
if
that's
what
this
means
in
the
texas
statute,
surely
it
does
not
allow
a
reasoned
moral
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
future
dangerousness
mean?
does
it
mean
whether
he
is
going
to
be
dangerous
tomorrow,
or
does
it
mean
whether
he
is
going
to
be
dangerousness...
danger
after
he
has
been
released
from
a
period
of
incarceration?
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mrs.
parker,
i
certainly
as
a
reasonable
juror,
given
this
instruction,
would
not
think
that
what
you
were
asking
me
was
whether
he's
going
to
be
future...
whether
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
tomorrow,
but
rather
whether
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
after
he's
released
from
prison--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
whatever
term
you
might
give
him
for
the
murder.
and
therefore
he
should
be
executed
because
he
will
be
dangerous
in
the
future
no
matter
how
long
you
leave
him
in
prison.
why
would
the
jury
be
asked
whether
this
person
must
be
executed
because
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
tomorrow
even
though
he's
going
to
be
in
prison
for
the
next
10
years
at
least?
i
can't
imagine
if
you're
talking
about
reasonable
understanding
of
the
jury.
