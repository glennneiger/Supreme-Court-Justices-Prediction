mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice
of
the
united
states,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
dorsie
johnson
was
19
when
he
accepted
the
gun
from
amanda
miles
and,
at
her
urging,
entered
the
allsup's
convenience
store
and
shot
jack
huddleston
to
death.
in
the
punishment
phase
of
his
trial
for
capital
murder,
the
jury
was
limited
to
answering
two
special
issues
under
the
former
texas
statute.
issue
one,
deliberately.
the
statute
has
a
text.
it
mandates
a
narrow
mens
rea
inquiry
into
the
deliberateness
of
the
act
that
proximately
caused
death.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
whose
cases
respondent
hardly
cites
and
does
not
discuss,
has
so
construed
it.
indeed,
respondent's
reference
at
page
40
of
its
brief
to
how
the
issue
might
be
construed
is
plain
wrong.
one
need
only
look
at
farris
v.
state
in
which
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
the
fact
the
defendant
had
a
gun
was
enough.
hardly
more
than
intentional
said
the
court
in
farris,
that
is
to
say,
the
element
of
which
mr.
johnson
had
just
been
convicted.
no,
said
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
farris.
the
issue
doesn't
even
ask
as
much
about
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
as
the
element
of
premeditation
which,
of
course,
was
universally
a
part
of
first
degree
murder
statutes
after
the
pennsylvania
statutory
compromise
of
1792.
deliberately,
as
the
district
attorney
said
to
the
jurors
here,
can
be
two
blinks
of
an
eye.
the
issue
does
not
call
for
a
reasoned
moral
response,
but
a
narrow
factual
one,
a
construction
we
submit
is
supported
by
this
court's
discussion
arrave
v.
creech.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
surely
the
entitlement
to
an
instruction
on
youthful
age
in
our
view
lasts
until
a
defendant
is
21
or
22.
by
the
respondent
referring
to
jurek
as
a--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
submit
that
one
could
look
first
to
respondent's
concession
here
that
jurek
was
youthful
although
he
was
22.
but
also
there
is
this
consensus,
justice
o'connor,
the
consensus
that
in
the
states
that
give
an
instruction
on
youth,
the
generality
of
those
states...
and
the
roll
call
was
called
in
stanford
v.
kentucky...
leave
it
to
the
jury,
guided
by
cautionary
instructions.
another
approach
is
to
say
up
to
the
age
of
21
or
22.
the
scientists
we
have
spoken...
whose
works
we've
cited,
speak
of
the
time
of
adolescence
which
lasts
somewhat
longer,
perhaps
23
or
24.
the
legal
tradition
that
dates
to
a
statute
of
the
4th
century
b.c.,
to
antiquity,
cut
off
the
age
at
25.
it
seems
to
us
that
19
surely
falls
within
the
range
as
to
which
there
is
unanimity
among
the
states--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--that
as
to
the
outer--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
lex
plaetoria
of
the
4th
century
b.c.
as
interpreted
by
justinian
and
the
institutes
would
have
extended
mercy
up
to
the
age
of
25
despite
the
coming
to
majority
at
14,
which
was
the
general
rule
under
roman
law,
justice
scalia.
that's
the
legal
tradition
of
which
we
speak
there.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
to
the
time
of
the
transaction
under
review,
justice
scalia,
as
i
understand
the
institutes.
the
point,
however,
for
present
purposes
is
not
an
idle
stroll
through
antiquity,
is
that
the
statutes
as
to
which...
of
which
the
court
spoke
in
stanford
v.
kentucky
focused
on
this
factor
of
adolescence.
if
we're
looking
not
for
numbers,
justice
o'connor,
but
for
characteristics,
i
think
there's
no
more
eloquent
statement
of
what
you
are
like
at
19
as
an
adolescent
than
dorsie
johnson's
father's
statement.
19,
he
said,
that's
a
foolish
age.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
justice
scalia,
we
do
not
submit--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
we
do
not
submit
that
is
constitutionally
required.
first,
with
respect
to
the
family
factors
that
you
mentioned,
justice
kennedy,
of
course
this
is
a
troubled
background.
i
mean,
his
mother
died,
his
sister
is
murdered,
he
falls
in
among
companions,
and
that
we
say
potentiates
the
effect.
but
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
effect
of
youth,
and
so--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
submit
that
it
can,
and
let
me
suggest
the
way
in
which
that
might
be
so.
again,
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
issue
of
deliberately,
this
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
looked
at
that
issue
with
respect
specifically
to
youth.
and
in
zimmerman
v.
state,
on
the
9th
of
april
1993,
they
said
that
youth
can
be
aggravated,
indeed,
that
it
was
properly
so
considered
in
zimmerman's
case.
and,
therefore,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
shut
off
any
consideration
of
youth
for
whatever
worth
youth
may
have
as
a
mitigating
factor.
we
regard
that
as
a
direct
assault
upon
the
language
that
you,
justice
kennedy,
used
for
the
court
in
saffle
v.
parks
at
page
493
in
which
you
said
that
the
state
must
not
cut
off
full
and
fair
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
justice
kennedy,
first
with
respect
to
the
factual
premise,
of
course
the
jury
heard
evidence
of
youth
in
this
case.
it
was
obvious
to
them.
the
trial
judge,
however,
shut
off
their
inquiry
rejecting
proposed
instructions
the
defendant
had
proposed,
and
instructing
the
jury
at
joint
appendix
147
at
the
top
paragraph
that
the
jurors
were
limited
to
answering
the
special
issues
that
had
been
submitted
to
them.
second,
justice
kennedy,
we
know,
after
graham
v.
collins,
that
we've
got
to
confront
and
look
at
what
this
court
has
done
since
1984,
and
that's
the
answer
it
respectfully
seems
to
us
to
your
second
question.
graham
invited,
indeed
required,
that
kind
of
careful
look.
we
take
the
graham
conclusion
as
being
reasonable
jurists
would
not
in
1984
have
been
compelled
to
the
conclusion
we
seek.
so,
i'd
like
to
look
at
that.
the
key
phrase
we
submit
is
reasoned
moral
response
not
because
we
think
the
phrase
is
talismanic,
but
because
it
well
describes
what
the
court
has
done
since
1987.
for
example,
the
term
was
invoked
by
the
court
in
sumner
v.
shuman.
there
you
rejected
the
categorical
imperative
of
death.
no
matter
how
egregious
the
crime,
you
said
that
sentencer--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--the
difference
is
that
this
court's
decisions,
particularly
lockett
and
eddings,
say
that,
recognize
that
youth
has
this
uniquely
powerful
mitigating
force.
that
tradition
of
lockett
and
eddings,
which
was
summoned
up
again
in
stanford
v.
kentucky,
is
what
identifies
youth
as
such
a
factor.
a
troubled
family
background
may
also
be
such
a
factor,
and
the
court
may
have
to
reach
that
in
another
case.
the
question
for
us,
therefore,
justice
kennedy,
is
how
is
it,
since
1984
or
1987,
has
the
teaching
of
lockett
and
eddings
that
identifies
this
uniquely
powerful
factor
focused
on
the
sentencing
process,
and
as
to
that,
we
put
alongside
sumner
v.
shuman,
stanford
and
penry
because
there
you
rejected
the
categorical
imperative
of
life.
you
thrust
back
again
on
the
sentencer
this
duty
of
looking
at
the
evidence
in
each
individual
case.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
state
and
the
amici
have
made
that
argument.
let
me
be
clear.
we
do
not
believe
that
jurek
should
be
overruled,
that
this
court
needs
to
overrule
jurek.
after
all,
in
proffitt
v.
florida,
the
court
upheld
the
florida
sentencing
statute
on
its
face,
and
yet,
when
hitchcock
v.
dugger
came
to
the
court
in
an
as-applied
challenge,
a
unanimous
court
said
that
the
statute
as
applied
to
that
particular
defendant
didn't
pass
constitutional
muster.
if
it
could
be
done
between
proffitt
and
hitchcock,
we
suggest
it
could
be
done
here.
and
penry
puts
paid,
it
seems
to
us,
to
the
argument
that
jurek
needs
to
be
overruled.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
well,
that
was
the
prosecutor's
words,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
two
special
issues
that
were
before
the
court
in
jurek,
justice
scalia,
had
at
1976
been
considered
only
in
two
cases
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
jurek
and
a
case
called
smith.
indeed,
the
issue
in
jurek
was
whether
the
texas
statute,
like
the
others
argued
that
day,
impermissibly
vested
undue
discretion
in
jurors.
so,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
as
applied,
as
it
has
played
out,
the
jurisprudence
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
robbed
the
first
special
issue
of
any
force
it
might
have
had
to
make
this
reasoned
moral
response.
hundreds
of
people
have
been
sentenced
to
death
under
this
statute.
fifty-six
times
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
looked
at
this
first
special
issue
and
never
found
the
evidence
wanting.
with
respect
to
the
second
special
issue,
in
the
zimmerman
case,
acknowledging,
quoting
justice
souter's
dissent
that
it
could
be
and
was
appropriately
used
as
aggravating,
even
in
mental
illness
cases,
these
disturbed
cases,
in
earhart,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said,
well,
mental
illness,
well,
that's
an
aggravator,
and
then
they
go
ahead
and
deny
a
mitigating
instruction
on
penry
grounds,
so
that
if,
indeed,
there
is
a
gap
between
the
promise
of
jurek
and
what
has,
in
fact,
occurred,
the
gap
has
occurred
because
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
accept
the
invitation
in
jurek.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
parallel
between
the
proffitt,
hitchcock,
and
jurek,
penry,
johnson
line,
but
i
acknowledge--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
new
limitation.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
attitude
toward
the
second
special
issue
has
changed
gradually
over
the
years.
we've
not,
justice
kennedy,
for
our
purposes
sought
to
identify
a
point
at
which
it
turned
or
didn't
turn.
certainly
in
the
wake
of
penry,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
been
moved
to
reevaluate
that
second
special
issue.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
hued
to
the
view
that
this
is
a
narrow
inquiry.
that
is
certainly
true.
it
has
given
the
extra
instruction,
commanded
by
penry
in
penry
type
cases
tried...
that
weren't
tried
under
the
new
statute
where
there
really
isn't
any
problem.
so,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
rejected
every
invitation
tendered
by
any
lawyer
of
whose
existence
i
am
aware
to
recognize
what
this
court
has
done
since
1987.
and
i
know,
justice
kennedy,
as
you
said,
that
this
is
not
a
teague
case,
but
graham
v.
collins
was,
and
the
issue
was
here.
and
justice
scalia
has
asked
me
about
jurek,
and
i
know
other
justices
are
concerned
about
it.
there
is
a
reliance
interest
that
the
state
can
legitimately
have
in
opinions
of
this
court,
such
as
jurek.
we
submit
that
the
reliance
interest
is
fully
satisfied
by
holding
these
claims
barred
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
on
direct
appeal,
the
state,
it
respectfully
seems
to
us,
must
take
the
consequences
of
not
having
paid
careful
attention
to
what
this
court
has
done
since
1987
because
having
rejected
the
categorical
imperatives
of
death
and
life,
you've
put
the
sentencing
process,
this
adversary
inquiry,
at
the
sentencing
phase
into
new
and
very
stark
relief.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
no,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
think
it
has
become
more
favorable
to
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
chief--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
in
some
ways
that
jurisprudence
has
become
more
favorable
to
the
state.
under
payne
v.
tennessee,
as
warned
by
dawson
v.
delaware,
the
state
has
a
freer
play
to
put
on
aggravating
evidence
and
have
the
jury
fully
consider
it.
the
state
took
full
advantage
of
that
here,
putting
in
the
aggravating
phase
such
things
as
the
defendant
had
made
a
vulgar
gesture
to
a
teacher
by
way
of
showing
he'd
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
and
so,
on
the
aggravating
side,
the
court
has
said,
yes,
there's
this
expanded
right.
on
the
mitigating
side,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
has
also
been
an
expansion,
but
guidance.
the
paragraph
in
saffle,
to
which
i
adverted
earlier,
it
respectfully
seems
to
us,
encapsulates
this
teaching
on
the
mitigating
side.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
in
sumner,
the
court
closed
the
door
for
good
and
all,
according
to
the
opinion,
on...
excuse
me...
the
categorical
imperative
of
death,
and
the
court
has
argued
about
whether
principles
are
new
or
not
new
under
the
rubric
of
teague.
that's
as
best
i
can
do
in
answer
to
your
question.
i
think
that
notion
of
what
was
obvious
when
and
what
was
new
has
been
a
significant
focus
of
this
court's
teachings
since
that
time.
well,
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
would
have
been
that
to
the
extent
that
the
cases
can
be
and
must
be
read
as
saying
that
a
reasoned
moral
judgment
must
be
applied
by
the
jury,
that
this
is
helpful
to
the
defendant
on
the
mitigating
side
of
the
ledger.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
helpful,
but
guided...
guided.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
tell
the
court
how
to
read
its
own
cases.
i
do
suggest
that
the
citation
of
lockett
and
eddings,
followed
by
the
admonition
to
prevent
capricious
leniency,
followed
by
the
statement
that
the
state
must
not
cut
off
full
and
fair
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence
in
saffle
v.
parks,
encapsulates
this
idea,
that
these
things
are
to
be
resolved
in
the
crucible
of
the
adversary
system
and
not
by
categorical
notions.
i
would
also
suggest
another
guidepost
for
the
court
as
it
approaches
this
case.
the
state,
after
all,
has
said
that
the
case
ought
to
be
tested
under
saffle
and
boyde.
give
some
deference
say
they.
but
if,
indeed,
these
special
issues
do
not
permit
a
reasoned
moral
inquiry...
reasoned
moral
response,
there
is
nothing
to
which
deference
may
appropriately
be
given.
and
we
submit,
of
course,
that
it
is
far
more
than
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
these
issues
do
not
permit
such
consideration.
now,
respondent
does
suggest...
and
this...
i
know
some
of
the
court's
questions
evoke
it...
that,
after
all,
the
jurors
heard
the
evidence.
after
all,
the
jurors
were
aware
that...
what
the
effect
of
their
questions
would
be.
but
that,
we
respectfully
suggest
is
another
way
of
saying
that
jurors
might
disregard
their
oaths
and
specific
instructions,
a
concept
this
court
has
rejected
in
other
settings,
in
griffin
v.
united
states.
so,
in
sum,
the
respondent
doesn't
address
reasoned
moral
response.
you
hardly
find
it
in
their
brief.
it
doesn't
address
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
done
in
these
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
talked
about.
it
doesn't
trace
what
we
submit
this
court
has
taught,
particularly
since
1987.
and
ultimately
and
critically,
respondent
says,
well,
the
jurors
might
have
done
it
anyway.
that
last
notion
strikes
very
deep
i
respectfully
submit.
in
morgan
v.
illinois,
the
court
held,
and
in
so
doing
rejected
in
rather
strong
terms
a
dissent
that
argued
the
contrary,
that
if
even
one
juror
would
not
follow
the
instructions
to
apply
mitigating
evidence,
that
the
verdict
could
not
stand.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
when
all
12
jurors
are
deprived
of
any
vehicle
at
all
to
express
their
reasoned
moral
response,
that
matters
are
much
worse.
this
process
to
which
the
court
directs
our
attention,
this
adversary
process...
dorsie
johnson,
his
early
life
filled
with
horrors,
as
has
been
acknowledged
in
some
of
the
discussion
here,
driven
out
into
the
arms
to
these
peers
who
traced
this
path
of
violence
and
substance
abuse,
his
father
saying
19
is
a
foolish
age...
i
respectfully
submit
that
no
advocate
in
this
court
who
has
ever
confronted
a
jury
to
try
a
case
that
involves
some
aspect
of
the
human
condition
can
doubt
that
this
evidence
to
a
properly
instructed
jury
would
have
unique
power.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
this
court's
emphasis
on
the
adversary
inquiry,
by
which
life
or
death
is
determined,
requires
that
a
jury
have
such
instructions
so
that
its
response
may
be
a
moral
one,
guided,
to
be
sure
as
this
court
has
warned
in
brown
and
saffle,
but
also
taking
account
of
the
core
value
of
this
mitigating
evidence.
i
would
respectfully
request
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
last
question,
it
is,
of
course,
true
that
texas
has
amended
article
37.071
of
its
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
now
provides
expressly
a
question
that
gives
this
life
option
by
asking
in
terms
about
moral
blameworthiness.
texas,
thus,
makes
it
unanimous
among
the
states
by
asking
some
form
of
question
that
is
a...
an
inclusive
question,
but
with
respect
to
how
you
treat
the
answers
to
the
questions
one
asks
jurors,
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
independent
life
option
must
be
provided.
the
states
are
free
to
shape
and
guide
how
the
sentencer
deals
with
answers
to
questions
that
are
clearly
put.
in
that
connection,
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
counsel
here,
contrary
to
the
assertion
made,
did
seek
to
give
the
jurors
a
life
option.
at
joint
appendix
128,
there's
the
requested
instruction
as
to
whether
mitigating
outweighs
aggravating
so
the
defendant
can
be
rehabilitated.
so,
there
was
some
effort
to
ameliorate,
which
was
turned
back
by
the
trial
judge.
but
more
significantly,
in
our
respectful
submission,
what
has
happened
since
1984
and
particularly
since
1987
is
that
this
adversary
process
is
supposed
to
work
in
a
particular
way,
and
the
respondent
is
plain
wrong
in
not
recognizing
that
a
majority
of
this
court
said
in
saffle
v.
parks
that
the
state
may
not
cut
off
full
and
fair
consideration...
not
some
consideration,
not
a
little
bit,
not
by
torturing
the
language,
but
full
and
fair
consideration.
and
here's
dorsie
johnson.
justice
o'connor,
when
i
was
on
my
feet
before,
i
had
forgotten
sandra
lockett
was
21,
and
hitchcock
was
20.
and
why
that
escaped
my
mind
i
don't
have
any
good
reason
for.
ultimately--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
white,
no,
i
will
not
be
here
making
that--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
will
never
make
that
argument,
justice
white,
because
i
don't
regard
it
as--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--well,
i
have
no
control
over
that,
but
that
does
not
accord
with
this
court's
precedents
in
any
sense
of
the
word;
that
is
to
say,
this
court
has
shorn
off
the
mandatory
parts.
it
has
directed
the
individualized
inquiry.
i
have
spent
the
whole
of
my
law
life
believing
that
jurors
do
reach
moral
responses,
but
i
have
spent
an
equal
amount
of
time
seeking
instructions
that
make
sure
those
responses
are
reasoned.
i
don't
find
in
the
use
of
that
phrase
anything
other
than
an--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--justice
white,
had
i
at
that
time
been
asked
to
argue
broadly
about
the
constitutional
defects
of
the
death
penalty
system,
i
might
very
well
have
made
such
arguments,
but
i
am
here--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
might
very
well
at
that
time
have
said
that
that
is
the
result
that
should
have
obtained
in
furman,
justice
white.
but
i
wish
to
insist
equally
that
i
have
read
carefully
the
court's
opinion
in
graham,
and
i
believe
that
we
have
fully
addressed
the
considerations
that
you
put
on
the
table
there
about
what
this
court
has
taught.
those
were
the
past,
and
in
the
times...
the
six
times
before
i've
been
here,
the
court
and
particularly
justice
white
has
reminded
me
that
one
day
i
may
argue
one
thing,
and
then
i'll
see
what
the
court
does
and
try
to
take
account
of
it--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--but...
and
i
think
that
finally
where
this
comes
out
is
this,
that
the
factual
inquiry
posed
by
these
two
special
issues
is
appropriate
perhaps
to
the
guilt
phase.
that's
where
we
make
factual
inquiries
to
begin
with.
we
treat
the
defendant
as
if
the
defendant
understood.
it's
the
sort
of
kantian
imperative.
but
in
this
sentencing
phase,
we
ask
the
real
question,
who
is
this
defendant?
what
choices
did
he
or
she
make
and
how
did
he
or
she
come
to
make
them?
this
is
not
a
wide-open,
rootless
inquiry,
particularly
in
light
of
lockett
and
eddings.
and
i
close,
justice
white,
by
saying
again
that
i
think
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
morgan
v.
illinois
is
the
guidepost
we
can
follow
because
there
legality--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--i
feel
disabled
from
responding
to
it.
[laughter]
i
read--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--well,
that
being
the
case--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
respectfully
request
leave
to
yield
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
because,
justice
stevens,
in
morgan
the
court
dealt
with
a
juror
who
said
i
don't
care
what
the
instructions
are,
i
won't
follow
them.
morgan,
in
the
last
part
where
the
court
speaks
of
the
dissent
and
the
dissent's
view
of
the
court's
precedents,
puts
the
morgan
holding
firmly
in
the
context
of
everything
the
court
had
done
since
woodson,
and
then
reaffirms
the
conclusion.
the
notion
is
that
having
a
juror
who
says
i
don't
care
what
the
instructions
are,
i
won't
follow
it,
that's
illegality.
that
invalidates
the
process.
we
say
that's
the
same
as...
indeed,
not
as
bad
as...
not
giving
the
jurors
any
instruction
at
all
about
full
and
fair
consideration
of
this
very
uniquely
powerful
category
of
mitigating
evidence.
that
to
us
is
a
part
of
this
process
of
making
sense,
a
part
of
this
process
of
saying
that
there
is
a
response
to
be
called
for,
and
yes,
it
is
moral,
but
that
the
process
of
reason
controlling
what
some
judges...
judge
higgenbotham
of
the
fifth
circuit
has
called
black
box
decisions...
must
be
one
of
which
the
touchstone
is
legality.
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
it
would
permit
it
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
michael
e.
tigar
--you
mean
with
respect
to
categories
of
offenses?
absolutely
not,
justice
stevens,
because
the
court...
reasoned
moral
response
becomes
newly
important
since
1987
because
the
court
has
rejected
the
categorical
imperative
of
life
with
respect
to
offenses
such
as
rape
and
the...
categorical
imperative
of
death
with
respect
to
offenses
such
as
rape
and
the
categorical
imperative
of
life
with
respect
even
to
youthful
and
mentally
retarded
offenders.
so--
