you
think,
mr.
tigar,
that
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
capital
cases,
since
1987
has
become,
at
least
in
this...
more
favorable
to
the
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
i
thought
from
your
statement
that
what
the
court
has
done
since
1987
we
have
to...
suggested
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
wrong,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
any
of

relying
expressly
noted
that

change
is
contemplated?

well,
mr.

from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.

saying
that
you
think
a
reasonable
juror
would
not
have
interpreted
it
the
way
justice
souter
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
parker,
under
texas
law,
is
a
trial
judge
authorized
to
give
an
answer
to
a
question
like
that?
i
mean,
these
two
questions
are
statutory,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
any
instruction
like
that
asked
for
here?
