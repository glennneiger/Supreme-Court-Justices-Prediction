mr.
tigar,
you
say
that
the
petitioner
was
19
when
the
offense
was
committed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
guess
under
texas
law,
he
became
an
adult
at
18?
justice

so,
how
long
in
your
view
is
youth
a
factor
then
in
a
case
such
as
this?
presumably
he
was
treated,
for
all
purposes
in
texas,
as
an
adult
at
the
age
of
18.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
do
you
say
that,
and
what
do
we
look
to?
i
find
that
a
difficult
aspect
of
the
case.
