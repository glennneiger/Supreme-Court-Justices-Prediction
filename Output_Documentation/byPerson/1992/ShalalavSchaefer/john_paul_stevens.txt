mr.
kelley--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
more
you
demonstrate
the
lack
of
likelihood
of
their
coming
back
to
get
fees,
the
more
you
are
demonstrating
the
fact
that
there's
going
to
be
an
awful
lot
of
wasted
filings
because
everybody
who
gets
a
remand
would
file.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
really
our...
i
mean,
maybe
the
statute
compels
it.
i
don't
know.
things
are
kind
of
confused
i
have
to
confess,
but
it
is
true
that
your
approach
would
require
more
than
half
of
the
litigants
to
file
papers
that
will
not
produce
any
result
and
just
clutter
up
the
files.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
of
those
who
have
gotten
remands.
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
a
small
number
will
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
all
right.
but
i
suppose
if
they
can
wait
until
they
are
actually
prevailing
before
the
agency,
you're
just
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
remand
judgment
was
a
final
judgment
subject
to
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
you
have
been
a
prevailing
party
at
that
point
and
if
the
government's
resistance
to
the
claim
at
that
point
has
not
been
substantially
justified,
isn't
there
good
reason
to
say
that
the
claimant
ought
to
get
his
fees
up
to
there
whether
he
wins
or
loses
on
remand
because
he
has
been
put
to
a
lot
of
unnecessary
expense
is
the
theory?
otherwise,
he
doesn't
get
any
fees
at
all.
