the
real
problem
here
is
our
decision
in
hudson,
not
in
melkonyan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
mr.
kelley.
mr.
fuller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
we
say
in
one
of
the
later
cases
that
hudson
applies
only
to
sentence
six
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
we
say
it
applied
only
to
sentence
four
cases
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
what
was
the
limitation
on
hudson
in
one
of
the...
either
melkonyan
or
finkelstein?
i
can't
remember
which
one
is
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
finkelstein
say
that
hudson
was
discussing
sentence
six
remands,
not
sentence
four
remands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--no,
hudson
didn't,
but
didn't
finkelstein
limit
hudson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
read
that
language
as
limiting
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kelley.
the
case
is
submitted.
