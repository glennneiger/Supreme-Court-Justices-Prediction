justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
case
held
the
litigant
was
entitled
to
fees
for
the
agency
proceedings,
didn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
sub
silentio
overruling
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
that's
the
40
percent
factor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
the
average
of
the
judicial
districts
would
be,
say,
20,
21
applications,
and
a
third
of
those
would
result
in
no
fees?
is
that
the
calculation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
all
of
those,
i
take
it,
though,
the
government
is
not
substantially
unjustified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
still
has
to
show
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
write
a
few
more
cases
on
this
in
the
next...
coming
terms,
maybe
the
statistics
will
break
it
down
then.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
inconsistent
with
what
we
held
in
hudson
before
the
melkonyan
gloss.
