mr.
william
k.
kelley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
respondent's
application
for
attorney's
fees
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
was
filed
on
time.
the
case
involves
the
interplay
between
two
statutes,
section
2412(d)
of
eaja,
and
42
united
states
code,
section
405(g),
which
is
the
provision
in
the
social
security
act
that
gives
unsuccessful
applicants
for
benefits
a
right
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
challenging
that
decision
in
district
court.
respondent
in
this
case
applied
for
benefits,
and
his
claim
was
denied
at
all
levels
of
the
administrative
process.
he
then
filed
a
civil
action
pursuant
to
section
405(g)
in
district
court.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
agency
had
made
a
mistake
and
reversed
the
decision
denying
respondent
benefits
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
it
is
undisputed
here
that
the
court
acted
pursuant
to
sentence
four
of
section
405(g).
that
sentence
gives
district
courts
the
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
affirming,
modifying,
or
reversing
the
decision
of
the
secretary
with
or
without
remanding
the
case
as
well.
respondent
did
not
at
that
time
file
his
eaja
fee
application,
but
instead
waited
until
after
he
was
awarded
benefits
on
remand
and
filed
an
application
at
that
point.
we
contend
that
that
application
was
untimely.
under
the
language
of
subsection
(d)(1)(b)
of
eaja,
a
fee
application
must
be
filed
within
30
days
of
final
judgment
in
the
underlying
civil
action
for
which
fees
are
being
sought.
subsection
(d)(2)(g)
of
eaja,
in
turn,
defines
the
term
final
judgment
to
mean
a
judgment
that
is
final
and
not
appealable.
sentence
eight
of
section
405(g)
says
that
the
judgment
entered
pursuant
to
sentence
four
is
a
final
judgment.
it
follows
under
the
language
of
these
statutes
that
respondent's
fee
application
was
due
at
the
time
that
the
sentence
for
judgment
was
entered
and
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
secretary.
now,
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
sullivan
against
finkelstein
and
melkonyan
against
sullivan
confirm
our
reading
of
the
statute
as
correct.
in
finkelstein,
the
court
held
that
sentence
four
remands
constitute
a
final
judgment
and
that
such
judgments
are
appealable.
in
that
decision,
the
court
said
that
any
action
a
court
takes
under
sentence
four
must
include
a
judgment,
whether
or
not
a
remand
is
included
as
well.
that
conclusion
followed
from
the
language
of
sentence
four
which
the
court
in
finkelstein
said,
quote,
directs
the
entry
of
a
judgment.
the
statute
does
not
say
that
a
district
court
can
do
anything
under
sentence
four
without
also
entering
a
judgment.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
in
finkelstein,
justice
scalia,
that
very
argument
was
made,
and
the
court
rejected
that
point
saying
that
regardless
of
the
label
the
district
court
attaches
to
its
order,
it
is
a
judgment
and
it
is
final
and
effective
as
such.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
yes,
otherwise
a
court
would
simply
be
free
to
act
contrary
to
what
the
statute
permits.
now,
sentence
six
of
section
405(g)
stands
in
contrast
to
sentence
four,
for
in
that
sentence
congress
gave
district
courts
the
authority
to
remand
cases
without
entering
judgment
and
also
to
require
the
secretary
to
return
to
district
court
after
the
remand
for
further
proceedings
in
district
court,
at
which
point
a
judgment
would
then
be
entered.
the
unanimous
opinion
a
year
later
in
melkonyan
confirmed...
further
confirms
our
reading
here.
in
melkonyan,
the
court
said
explicitly
that
section
405(g)
only
authorizes
district
courts
to
act
pursuant
to
the
procedures
of
sentence
four
or
sentence
six.
there
is
no
room
in
that
statute
for
a
hybrid
procedure,
such
as
the
one
respondent
urges
here.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we
did
concede
that
in
that
case.
this
court's
decisions
in
finkelstein
and
melkonyan
following
hudson
have--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--that
is
certainly
true
as
well,
but
melkonyan
referred
to
hudson
as
encompassing
a
narrow
class
of
cases.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
and
our
submission
is
that
hudson
applies
only
in
sentence
six
cases
because
under
the
terms
of
sentence
four,
as
the
court
interpreted
that
sentence
in
finkelstein
and
melkonyan
subsequent
to
hudson,
the
court
has
concluded
that
there
is
no
such
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
quite
agree
that
congress
intended
applicants
who
succeed
in
litigation
against
the
government
and
obtain
benefits
in
which
in
our
case...
our
position
was
not
substantially
justified
to
get
benefits.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
quite
true,
and
that
problem
is
easily
solved,
we
would
submit,
simply
by
filing
an
application
at
the
time
congress
has
required
under
the
terms
of
the
two
statutes.
that
application
can
be
held
in
abeyance
until
after
it
is
clear
whether
the
person
is
a
prevailing
party
and
resolved
at
that
time.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
problem,
justice
souter,
for
this
reason.
the
claimant,
after
proceedings
on
remand
have
been
finished,
has
every
incentive
to
rush
back
to
district
court
for
his
fees.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
under
respondent's
view
there
is
similarly
a
problem
of
no
time
limit.
under
respondent's
submission,
the
burden
is
on
either
the
secretary
or
the
claimant
to
go
back
to
district
court
at
some
unspecified
time,
without
time
limit,
after
the
remand
proceedings
are
completed
and
obtain
a
judgment.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
that's
precisely...
in
effect,
i
should
say,
precisely
the
submission
the
court
rejected
in
melkonyan,
which
is
that
matters
should
stand
in
abeyance
until
the
proceedings
on
remand
are
finished
and
the
decision
of
the
administrative
agency
will
demonstrate
whether
the
party
is
a
prevailing
party,
and
the
time
period
should
then
start
then.
that...
the
court
rejected
that
position
of
the
government
in
that
case
unanimously.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
position
would
have
workability
problems
as
well
because
it
would
be...
it
will
be
an
inchoate
time
which...
at
which
the
fee
application
would
be
due.
congress
made
a
very
deliberate
decision
here
to
put
a
strict
30-day
limit--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--i
suppose
that
is
correct,
and
perhaps
i
misspoke,
but
the
point
remains
that
the
court
in
melkonyan
concluded
that
that
very
regime
was
unauthorized
by
the
statutes.
the
court
in
melkonyan
said
that
eaja
requires
the
time
period
to
be
measured
from
the
judgment
of
a
court.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
oh,
but
he
will,
justice
scalia.
at
that
point,
he
will
know
how
much
time
and
money
has
been
spent
in
litigation,
and--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
contend
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
such
fees
in
sentence
four
cases
if
hudson
is
limited
as
we
have
submitted.
even
if
hudson
is
not
limited
in
that
fashion,
however,
it
is
a
small
matter.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
has
never
been
adjudicated
as
such,
but
we
agree
that
it
was,
yes.
and--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--the
case
did
so
hold,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
court's
subsequent
decisions
in
finkelstein
and
melkonyan
have
demonstrated
that
the
statutory
authorization
for
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
in
the
manner
the
hudson
court
contemplated
is
limited
to
sentence
six
cases.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
i
don't
believe
it's
an
overruling,
justice
kennedy.
we
believe
it
has
been
limited
in...
just
by
terms...
in
terms
of
the
logic
of
the
court's
subsequent
cases.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
it's
quite
clear
we
believe,
justice
white,
that
initially
that
is
certainly
true.
5
united
states
code,
section
504(c)
governs
fees
for
adversary
adjudication
before
agencies,
and
these
are
not
adversary
adjudications.
and
the
hudson
court
did
not
suggest
that
you're
entitled
to
fees
for
the
initial
administrative
process.
but
under
our
submission
in
this
case,
it
would...
we
do
contend
that
the
fees
on
remand
in
sentence
four
cases
are
inappropriate
because
of
the
court's
subsequent
decisions
in
finkelstein
and
melkonyan.
i
would
hasten
to
add,
however,
that
that
is
not
necessary
to
our
prevailing
in
this
case.
it
is
a
small
matter
for
a
fee
applicant
to
supplement
his
fee
application
that
is
already
on
file
if
the
court
subsequently
determines
that
he's
entitled
to
fees.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
it
assumes
that
you
will
know
what
amount
of
fees
you
are
entitled
to
to
that
point,
but
it
is
not
a
known
in
the
law...
and
we
do
not
believe
it
makes
a
mishmash
of
subsection
(b)
to
supplement
a
fee
application.
for
example,
the
court...
courts
frequently
award
fees
for
proceedings
on
appeal,
and
fee
applications
are
supplemented
to
cover
those
fees.
in
fact,
the
fee
application
in
this
very
case
was
so
supplemented.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
yes,
they
do,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
the
problem
with
that
position
we
believe
that
it
is
inconsistent
both
with
section
405(g)
and
the
terms
of
sentence
four
and
sentence
eight
and
with
this
court's
decisions
in
finkelstein
and
melkonyan.
in
finkelstein,
the
court
held
that
a
sentence
four
action
by
a
district
court
had
to
be
a
judgment
and
that
that
judgment
terminates
the
civil
action.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
true.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
true,
but--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--i
would
suppose
it
is
conceivable,
but--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--we
believe
it
is
odd,
and
the
court
in
finkelstein
rejected
our...
i'm
sorry...
declined
to
adopt
our
alternate
submission
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine
which
would
more
readily
lend
itself
to
one
side
appealing
and
not
the
other.
but
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
that
it
matters
whether
the
claimant
can
appeal
a
sentence
four
judgment
because
a
claimant
who
has
reason
to
appeal
has
no
reason
to
file
a
fee
application
ordinarily.
the
time
for
filing
a
fee
application...
the
fee
application
issue
only
arises
if
the
government
has
had
an
unfavorable
ruling
against
it.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
he
submits--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
he
has
done
everything
he
can
to
that
point--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--to
be
a
prevailing
party.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
he
has
to
show
that
as
well.
now,
we
believe--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--the
eligibility
provision
we
believe
is
naturally
read
to
refer
to
the
financial
status
of
the
fee
applicant,
which
is
further
down
in
section
2412(d),
which
is
having
a
net
worth
of
less
than
$2
million.
that
is
the
eligibility.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
but
in
any
event--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--the
reason
it
could
not
be
immediately
awarded
is
that
under
current
law
and
as
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
hudson
and
finkelstein,
that
simply
obtaining
a
remand
is
not
enough
to
qualify
one
for
attorney's
fees.
one
has
to
gain
benefits
after
remand.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that's
correct.
what
these
people
are
after,
of
course,
is
benefits,
and
if
you
don't
get--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--at
that
point--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--at
that
point,
we
would
acknowledge
he
cannot
state
that
he
is
for
certain
a
prevailing
party.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
so
much
of
a
mishmash.
the
only
difficulty
here
is
the--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--is
the
verb
tense
of
the
word
is.
and
a
fee
applicant
is
fully
able
to
state--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
in
any
event,
we
would
suggest
that
the
alternative
to
that
view
is
an
amendment
to
the
substantive
terms
of
the
cause
of
action,
which
is
a
standalone
cause
of
action
provided
in
section
405(g).
we
would
submit
it
would
be
quite
odd
for
an
attorney's
fees
statute
to
be
interpreted
so
as
to
change
the
very
nature
of
a
cause
of
action
that
was
otherwise
provided
by
congress.
now,
it
is
not
an
unworkable
regime.
it
is
a
small
matter
we
believe
to
file
a
fee
application.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
in
recent
years,
it
has
been--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--oh,
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
justice
o'connor,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
the...
there
are
not
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these
cases.
in
fact,
in
the
most
recent
fiscal
year
for
which
we
have
statistics,
1991,
the
maximum
number
of
possible
fee
applications
that
would
have
been
filed
that
turned
out
to
be
unnecessary
would
have
been
somewhere
around
seven
or
eight
per
judicial
district
across
the
country.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that...
in
the
last
2
years,
it
has
run
roughly
about
a
third
have
not
gotten
benefits
on
remand,
and
that...
so,
the--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--25
perhaps
per
district,
and
a
third
would
result
in
no
fees.
that
would
be
my
estimation.
it's
very
close
to
that.
and
it's
a
small
matter
for
a
district
court
to
have
that
fee
application
on
its
docket.
it
requires
the
district
court
to
do
nothing,
and
when
matters
on
remand
are
completed,
the
claimant
certainly
has
every
incentive
to
come
back
and
say
i'm
ready
to
get
my
money.
so,
i--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--that
is
true.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
true.
he
has
to
show
that,
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
that
number
includes
both
sentence
six
and
sentence
four
remands.
our
statistics
don't
yet
distinguish
between
the
two.
so,
it's
even
fewer
than
that.
so,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
be
thinking
that
this
really
is
an
enormous
number
of
cases
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
the--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
would
agree
that
people
who
get
a
remand
would
thus
have
to
file.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
true,
justice
stevens.
it's
about
a
third
at
the
maximum--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--oh,
i
see,
but
only
a
very
small
number
of
those
will
turn
out
not
to
be...
turn
out
to
be
unnecessary.
excuse
me.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
about
a
maximum
of
a
third,
in
recent
years
at
least.
the
other
two-thirds
succeed
in
getting
benefits
on
remand
and
they
have...
their
fee
application
will
be
litigated
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
would
submit,
justice
white,
that
the
statute
doesn't
permit
that
to
be
ignored.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that's...
we
believe
that
that,
in
effect,
is
true.
and--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--it's
not
only
these
two
provisions,
justice
white.
it
is
also
section
405(g).
if,
as
you
put
it,
that
you
play
games
with
the
first
part
of
the
provision
and
just
wait
and
ignore
the
30-day
time
limit,
what
you've
established
then
is
the
system
the
court
rejected
in
melkonyan,
which
is
that
the
administrative
decision
will
be
the
triggering
event.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
no,
justice
scalia,
the
court
has
never
held
that.
the
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--yes,
you
have.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
solving
it,
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
it
would
also
upset
a
lot
of
settled
law
in
the
lower
courts
to
hold
that.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
correct.
but
those
cases--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--i
was
going
to
get
to
the
point
that
those
cases
are...
have
a
lot
going
for
them.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
they
make
sense,
justice
scalia,
because
these
people,
the
claimants,
are
not
after
simply
getting
a
remand.
what
they're
after
is
benefits,
and
it
is
well
established,
as
i've
said,
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
it
is
not
enough.
you
haven't
won
anything,
in
effect,
if
you
just
get
a
remand.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
certainly
is
a
favorable
legal
ruling.
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
the
point
is
that
it
doesn't
require
the
secretary
to
give
you
anything.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
that
is
true
in
theory.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
about
a
third
of
the
time.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
it's
theoretically
conceivable
that
your
initial
decision
and
your
decision
to
contest
it
was
unjustified,
but
when
you
go
back
and
do
it
right,
it
turns
out
that
the--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
we
would
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
hudson,
as
limited
to
sentence
six
cases,
is
fully
consistent
with
finkelstein
and
melkonyan.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
but
i
would
hasten
to
point
out
that
the
question
of
what
you
need
to
do
to
become
a
prevailing
party
really
isn't
presented
here.
it
certainly
is
lurking
behind
the
scenes,
but
it
hasn't
been
briefed
by
the
parties,
and
it
hasn't
been
passed
upon
by
the
lower
courts.
so,
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
make
a
holding
on
that
basis.
in
our
view,
our
submission--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--on
the
basis
justice
scalia
is
suggesting
that
one
is
a
prevailing
party
simply
by
virtue
of
getting
a
remand.
that
would
work
a
large
change
in
the
law
in
the
lower
courts,
as
i
fully
recognize.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
we
would...
i
would
agree,
justice
scalia,
that
you
should
not
rule
against
us
on
the
premise
that
you're
not
a
prevailing
party.
it
does
make
sense,
if
you're
truly
concerned
about
the
is
issue,
to
hold
based
on
the
premise
that
one
might
be
a
prevailing
party
at
the
time
of
remand.
it
does
make
sense
of
the
whole
scheme.
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
it
is
fully
consistent
with
the
statute
and
very
workable
to
say
that
you
can
file
a
fee
application
when
the
proceedings
on
remand
begin
or...
excuse
me...
after
you
get
your
remand,
and
you
can
state
at
that
time
you've
done
everything
you
can
to
be
a
prevailing
party,
and
it
is
a
small
matter
to
come
back
to
court
after
the
proceedings
on
remand
are
finished.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
true,
justice
white.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
that's
true.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
they
are
not.
that's
true.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that's
true
as
well,
justice
white.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
entitled
to
fees?
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
since
hudson
and
the
subsequent
cases
in
this
court,
i
don't
believe
that
the
lower
courts
have
focused
on
that
issue.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
that
is
exactly
right,
and
we
believe
it's
very
important,
if
you
go
on
the
prevailing
party
side,
to
recognize
that
hudson
fees
are
not
available
in
sentence
four
cases.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
two
points.
first,
we
believe
that
our
approach,
as
set
forth
in
the
brief,
accommodates
the
language
of
all
the
relevant
statutes
in
this
court's
cases,
quite
unlike
respondent's
approach.
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that,
we
believe
it
would
be
preferable
to
adopt
the
approach
suggested
by
justice
scalia
that
one
is
a
prevailing
party
when
one
gets
a
sentence
four
remand.
but
we
would
also
urge
at
that
point
that
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
an
award
of
so-called
hudson
fees
for
the
proceedings
on
remand.
the
second
point
is
as
to
the
application
of
the
rules
in
this
case,
respondent's
argument
regarding
rule
58
and
retroactivity
was
not
raised
or
passed
upon
below,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
remand
the
case
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
those
issues
in
the
first
instance.
thank
you.
