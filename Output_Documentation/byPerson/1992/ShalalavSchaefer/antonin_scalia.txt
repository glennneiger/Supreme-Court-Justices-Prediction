justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
a
court
makes
a
mistake?
isn't
that
possible?
i
mean
to
say
that
the
court
should
have
entered
a
judgment
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
the
court
did
enter
a
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
shall
be
deemed
a
judgment
whether
the
court
says
so
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
kelley,
if
we're
talking
about
what
eaja
requires,
it...
the
provision
says
within
30
days
of
final
judgment,
the
party
seeking
the
award
shall
submit
to
the
court
an
application
for
fees,
not
just
an
application
for
fees,
but
an
application
which
shows
that
the
party
is
a
prevailing
party
and
is
eligible
to
receive
an
award
under
this
subsection
and
the
amount
sought,
including
an
itemized
statement
from
any
attorney
or
expert
witness
representing
or
appearing
in
behalf
of
the...
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
so
forth.
that
can't
possibly
be
done
at
the
time
you
say
it's
supposed
to
be
done
because
he
won't
know
what
his
attorney's
fees
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
district
court.
but...
well,
you
do
not
contend
then
that
he's
entitled
to
any
of
the
fees
from
what
occurs
on
remand.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
why
do
you
have
to
wait?
why
do
you...
oh,
you
have
to
wait
for
the
completion
of
the
proceedings
below
not
in
order
to
get
the
fees,
but
simply
to
be
sure
that
he's
the
prevailing
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
that's
a
real
limitation
on
hudson.
hudson
was,
in
fact,
despite
what
we
said
in
melkonyan,
a
sentence
four
remand,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
--true,
but
it
makes
mush
of
subsection
(b),
which
obviously
anticipates
that
at
the
time
you...
within
that
30
days,
when
you
have
to
appeal
the
final
judgment,
simultaneously
have
at
hand
the
amount
of
your
fees.
that's
what
it
assumes--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
read
is
to
mean
will
be,
and
that
is
not
making
mishmash
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
not
even
will
be,
may
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
don't
have
to
play
games,
do
you,
if
you
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals
whether
or
not
you
prevail
before
the
agency
on
remand.
have
we
ever
held
that
in
order
to
be
a
prevailing
party,
you
must
prevail
in
a
section
4...
in
a
sentence
four
case,
not
a
sentence
six
case?
have
we
ever
held
that
in
a
sentence
four
case
you're
not
entitled
to
fees
unless
you
prevailed
before
the
agency
on
remand?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
they
have,
but
we
haven't.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
doesn't
the
scheme
make
total
sense
if
we
hold
that
you
prevail
in
a
sentence
four
case
as
soon
as
you
win
the
court
of
appeals
judgment?
thereupon,
you
file
your
application
for
fees,
you
get
your
fees
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
whatever
happens
back
below
on
remand,
happens
back
below
on
remand.
the
game
is
over.
just
as
far
as
the
mishmosh
problem
is
concerned,
wouldn't
that
solve
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
well,
but
maybe
it's
wrong
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
government,
i'm
sure
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
have.
you've
won
your
point
that
the
agency
procedure
or
whatever
it
was
was
wrong,
and
the
agency
wouldn't
straighten
it
out.
and
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
to
the
agency
straighten
it
out
and
sends
it
back
down.
you've
certainly
won
that.
i
mean,
yes,
you
haven't
gotten
your
money
yet,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
sentence
six
case,
you
have
not
won
anything
because
the
court
hasn't
made
its
decision
yet.
it
sends
it
back
to
the
agency,
retains
jurisdiction
because
it
needs
more
information,
the
agency
has
to
develop
more,
whatever.
and
only
after
it
comes
back
do
you
know
whether
the
claimant
has
won
or
lost.
so,
it
makes
total
sense
in
the
section
6
case
to
wait
until
it
comes
back.
but,
of
course,
in
the
sentence
six
case,
the
judgment
is
not
final
until
it
comes
back,
and
you
take
the
final
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
think
that
that's
the
only
solution
that
makes
sense
out
of
the
statute,
how
can
i
avoid...
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
mr.
kelley.
i
don't
understand
that.
i
asked
you
earlier.
the
government
does
not
contend
that
you're
entitled
to
fees
on
remand
in
a
sentence
four
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
they're
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it
is
sort
of
a
wash
for
the
government
really.
you
have
to
pay
the
fees
in
the
district
court
whether
or
not
the
claimant
wins
on
remand,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
fees
that
are
incurred
on
the
remand--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
that's
the
fair
import
of
it
when
it
says
it
applies
to
a
narrow
category
of
cases?
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
hudson
applies
to
sentence
six.
what
is
your
position?
do
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
contrary
to
our
whole
description
of
what
the
basic
distinction
between
four
and
six
is.
i
thought
the
basic
distinction
is
under
sentence
four,
the
district
court
is
done
with
the
case.
it
reverses
the
secretary
and
sends
it
back.
the
claimant
has
won
on
the
point
that
is
the
subject
of
the
appeal;
whereas,
in
a
sentence
six
case,
the
court
says,
well,
i
can't
decide
this
without
some
further
action
below
and
i'm
going
to
sit
on
it
and
send
it
back
for
more...
a
bigger
record
to
be
made
or
whatever.
and
i'm
not
making
any
decision
yet.
i'm
just
asking
the
agency
to
give
me
more
action,
more
information.
i
thought...
well,
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
so
that
the
case
is
really
not
over
in
the
district
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
sentence
six.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
over
under
sentence
four.
justice
antonin
scalia
somebody
has
won
and
you
go
back,
just
as
any
other
administrative
agency
case
is
remanded
after
the
agency
has
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
continuation
of
the
agency
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
lawsuit
is
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i'm
not
saying...
that
doesn't
necessarily
answer
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
he
can't
appeal
it
because
he
has
won.
he
has
won
what
he...
we're
talking
about
a
sentence
four.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
has
won.
why...
how
could
he
appeal
it.
that's
absolutely
right.
