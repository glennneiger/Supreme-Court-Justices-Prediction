unknown
speaker
yes.
and
it
is
the
case
that
there's
no
doubt
that
you
cannot
get
fees
in
the
district
court
for
the
agency
work
that
is
done
before
the
district
court
action.
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
really
is
a
strange
scheme
where
you
don't
get
any
fees
for
the
work
up
to
the
district
court,
but
then
if
the
district
court
reverses
the
agency
and
says
do
it
again
and
do
it
right
this
time,
then
you
do
get
fees
for
the...
for
that
one,
or
maybe.
well,
that's
what
the
chief
justice
suggests
isn't
true
because
hudson
was
limited.
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
me
how
it
is
that
you
think
you
win
under
that
one
anyway?
i
thought
you
hadn't
filed
an
appeal
within
the
30
days
from
the
district
court
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
that
can
be
waived
because
you
couldn't
know
from
hudson
that
you
had
to.
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
unknown
speaker
that's
true.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
you'd
say
it
was
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
not
to
enter
that
judgment,
but
nonetheless,
there
was
no
judgment
entered.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
on
that
basis,
we
don't
need
to
decide
all
of
this
stuff
about
the
is
or
anything
like
that.
i
mean,
you
just
have
a...
you
have
an
independent
reason
for
winning
your
case.
unknown
speaker
in
these
appeals
to
the
district
court,
is
new
evidence
sometimes
a
ground
for
asking
that
the
case
be
remanded,
new
evidence
of
disability,
new
medical
evidence?
unknown
speaker
those
are
typically
sentence
six
remands.
unknown
speaker
what
i
was
wondering
was
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
there
was
lack
of
substantial
justification
on
the
part
of
the
government
if
we
make
the
fee
assessment
at
the...
after
the
district
court
proceedings
in
sentence
four
cases.
what
are
the
typical
cases--
unknown
speaker
--in
which
the
government
would
be
substantially
unjustified?
if
the
hearing
examiner
hears
only
one
doctor
instead
of
three?
unknown
speaker
and
the
government
is
substantially
unjustified
because...
for
raising
an
objection
before
the
hearing
examiner?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
substantial
justification
referred
to
in
(b)
is
whether
the
united
states
position
before
the
district
court
was
substantially
justified?
is
that
what
it
refers
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
denial
of
benefits...
if
the
denial
of
benefits
was
unjustified,
the
government's
position
before
the
district
court
will
always
be
unjustified.
right?
unknown
speaker
but
in
some
cases,
the
denial
of
benefits
might
have
been
quite
justified,
but
for
some
procedural
reason,
nonetheless,
the
government's
position
before
the
district
court
may
be
unjustified.
unknown
speaker
do
you
follow
me?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
get
fees
before
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
unjustification
there.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the...
with
mr.
kelley's
figures
on
the
numbers
of
cases
involved?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fuller,
could
you
tell
me...
and
you
just
have
to
give
me
your
impression
because
i
don't
know
there
would
be
any
statistics
on
it,
but
as
a
general
matter,
when
a
claimant
wins
before
the
district
court
and
there
is
a
sentence
four
remand
and
he's
victorious
on
the
remand...
he's
among
the...
what
is
it...
the--
unknown
speaker
--two-thirds
who
are
victorious.
does
that
normally
take
a
lot
more
time
or
basically
has
the
agency
been
beaten
into
the
ground
and
they
throw
in
the
towel?
i
mean,
does
it
normally
take
a
lot
more
work
back
before
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
judgment
is
final
for
the
secretary,
but
not
for
you.
unknown
speaker
and
so,
he
doesn't
need
to
do
anything
in
the
district
court
within
30
days.
unknown
speaker
but
what...
let's
just
assume
that
it
is
irrelevant
as
to
whether
you
prevail
on
remand
or
not,
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
entitled
to
fees
for
the
work
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
makes
it
very
easy.
yes.
well,
which
would
you
rather
have?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
just...
but
also
on
the
assumption
that
you're
not
entitled
to
fees
for
your
work
after
remand.
unknown
speaker
sentence
four.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
you'll
get
more
if
you
prevail.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
but
you
are.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
are.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
preference
to
leave
the
present
system
intact
is
a
dollars
and
cents
calculation.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
fuller.
mr.
kelley,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
