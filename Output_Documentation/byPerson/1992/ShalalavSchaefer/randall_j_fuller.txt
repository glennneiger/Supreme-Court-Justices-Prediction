mr.
randall
j.
fuller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
the
court
is
presented
with
the
question
whether
the
equal
access
to
justice
statute
permits
a
social
security
disability
claimant,
whose
case
is
remanded
from
the
federal
court
to
the
secretary
for
further
administrative
proceedings,
under
the
fourth
sentence
of
section
405(g)
to
file
his
application
for
eaja
fees
upon
successful
completion
of
the
administrative
remand
proceedings,
or
whether
as
urged
by
the
government,
every
such
claimant
must
immediately
after
receipt
of
a
sentence
four
remand
file
a
conditional
eaja
application
at
that
time.
we
contend
that
the
decision
below
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
granting
my
client,
mr.
schaefer,
an
eaja
award
in
the
amount
of
$1,372.50
should
be
affirmed,
and
today
i
would
like
to
focus
upon
the
three
main
reasons
why
it
should
be
affirmed.
the
first
is
that
the
lower
court
decision,
in
accordance
with
nationwide
practice
since
at
least
1989,
is
consistent
with
the
plain
terms
and
the
intent
of
the
eaja
statute.
secondly,
considering
the
matter
from
a
common
sense
standpoint,
our
approach
is
much
more
practical
and
reasonable
than
the
unworkable
solution
posited
by
the
government
today.
finally,
the
procedure
that
we
followed
in
asking
for
eaja
fees
in
this
case
was
directly
consistent
with
and,
indeed,
may
be
mandated
by
this
court's
decision
in
hudson.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
said
at
all,
and
hudson
in
fact
was
a
sentence
four
case,
as
the
government
has
indicated
today.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
no.
hudson
was
decided
before
all
this
litigation
regarding
the
distinction
between
the
two.
hudson
simply
stood
for
the
proposition
that
a
claimant,
after
remand,
was
entitled
to
eaja
fees
for
the
work
performed
by
his
counsel
during
the
remand
process.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
well,
melkonyan
and
finkelstein
both
discussed
hudson.
they
did
not
overrule
hudson.
they
said
that
hudson
was
not
to
the
contrary.
melkonyan
was
a
sentence
six
case.
it
was
clearly
not
a
sentence
four
case.
and
there
the
question
was
whether
the
administrative
agency
decision
or
the
federal
court
decision
was
what
started
the
time
limit
ticking.
finkelstein
was
not...
that
was
also
a
sentence
four
case,
but
there
the
issue
importantly
and
very
significantly...
this
is
crucial.
that
was
not
an
eaja
case.
in
finkelstein,
what
this
court
said
was
that
that
decision
of
the
district
court
was
appealable
as
a
final
order.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i
don't
think
that
it
explicitly
said
that.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
our
position
is
that
hudson
applies
to
both
types
of
remands.
hudson
did
not
limit
itself
by
its
holding--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--i
don't
believe
it
did.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i
don't
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
say
that
they're
wrong.
i
would
say
that
there
has
been
some
confusion
caused
by
some
of
the
later
holdings,
but
it's
not
confusion
which
cannot
be
harmonized.
and
let's
talk
about
that.
melkonyan
seems
to
be
the
case
which
the
government
relies
upon
most
significantly
and
particularly
the
dicta
in
melkonyan
relative
to
sentence
four
remands.
now,
melkonyan
is
not
against
us
in
this
case
because
it
specifically
discusses
hudson
and
says
that
hudson
is
not
to
the
contrary.
melkonyan
was
a
sentence
six.
ours
is
a
sentence
four
case,
just
as
hudson
was.
and
even
the
dicta
referring
to
sentence
four
from
melkonyan
in
this
case
can
be
harmonized
and
reconciled
completely
with
our
position,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
under
sentence
four
and
my
experience
and
a
reading
of
that
sentence
indicates
that
there
are
two
potential
types
of
sentence
four
remands.
the
first
would
be
that
present
in
our
case,
and
that
is
where
the
secretary's
decision
is
reversed
on
legal
grounds
and
sent
back
for
further
proceedings.
the
second
possibility
under
sentence
four
is
that
the
decision
of
the
secretary
is
out
and
out
reversed
and
simply
sent
back
for
a
ministerial
or
administrative
calculation
of
benefits.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i
would
say
that
the
distinguishing
feature
between
the
sentence
four
and
sentence
six
remands
is
what
the
statute
calls
for,
which
is
good
cause
for
evidence,
which
was
not
developed
in
the
record.
and
the
reason
under
sentence
six
that
cases
get
sent
back
and
the
reason
that
sentence
six
permits
the
secretary
to...
before
she
even
files
her
answer
in
a
case,
to
move
for
a
sentence
six
remand
is
that
new
evidence
was
not
present
and
needs
to
be
developed.
that
is
the
distinguishing
feature
as
i
read
those--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--right.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
yes.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
well--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--let
me
turn
to
that.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
let
me
turn
to
that
and
discuss
why,
even
if
that
is
true,
justice
scalia,
that
does
not
start
the
time
limit
ticking
for
eaja
fees.
and
the
reason--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--and
the
reason
that
it
doesn't
start
the
time
limit
ticking
is
because
that
decision,
that
sentence
four
remand,
is
not
appealable
by
the
claimant,
while
it
is
appealable
by
the
secretary.
the
eaja
statute
contemplates
a
final
judgment
for
which
the
appeal
time
has
run
as
to
the
party
seeking
the
fees.
finkelstein
reserves
the
question
of
whether
a
claimant
can
appeal
a
sentence
four
remand.
it's
not
allowed
at
the
present
time
under
the
law,
and
in
the
eighth
circuit,
it
has
been
held
that
a
claimant
cannot
appeal
such
a
remand
in
the
bohms
case,
which
is
cited.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
sentence
four
remand.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
that's
right.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
and
that
may,
in
fact,
be
the
case,
as
was
discussed
previously
by
counsel.
the
court
has
not
held--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--actually
it
would
not
affect
our
case.
mr.
schaefer
would
still
prevail
in
this
case
for
two
reasons.
first,
there
was
no
rule
58
judgment
issued
at
the
point
in
time
of
the
sentence
four
remand
in
our
case.
therefore,
that
appeal
time
had
not
started
to
run.
the
time
limit
had
not
started
to
run.
more
importantly,
we
followed
the
practice
that
was
the
law
at
the
time.
under
the
secretary's
theory...
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
time
frame
and
the
background
of
our
case.
the
administrative
remand
occurred
on
april
5,
1989.
under
the
secretary's
theory,
we
then
had
until
july
5,
1989
in
which
to
make
that
application.
at
that
point
in
time...
and
this
court
did
not
decide
hudson
until
june
of
1989.
so,
at
that
point,
there
was
no
way
for
us
to
know
or
anticipate
that
not
only
would
hudson
come,
but...
although
we
may
have
filed
after
hudson
under
the
secretary's
theory,
in
which
case
we
never
would
have
filed
at
that
point
because
hudson
tells
us
to
wait
until
the
administrative
process
is
complete
and
the
prevailing
party
status
is
determined.
at
that
point
in
1989,
there's
no
way
that
we
could
have
anticipated
that
finkelstein
would
come
later
and
melkonyan
would
come
after
that.
so,
the
position
of
mr.
schaefer
is
vindicated
regardless
of
what
the
court
finds.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i
don't
believe
that
that
has
been
held.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
right,
that
you
must--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--right,
that
you
must
win
your
benefits
to
be
the
prevailing
party.
exactly.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
you've
prevailed
in
the
sense
of
a
sentence
four.
i
think
it's
arguable
that
you
have
prevailed
at
that
time
because
a
sentence
four
usually
contemplates
a
reversal
of
some
action
by
the
secretary
in
denying
the
benefits.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
unless
this
court
held
that
to
effectuate
hudson,
that
a
second
petition
for
eaja
fees
was
possible
for
the
administrative
work
if
the
claimant
prevailed.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i
think
what...
justice
o'connor
what
you're
suggesting
is
probably
true
as
to
the
practical
effect
of
a
decision
that
the
claimant
became
the
prevailing
party
upon
remand.
then
lots
of
claimants
would
get
fees.
those
31
to
38
percent
of
the
claimants
who
lose
upon
remand
would
have
gotten
fees
at
that
time.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
that's
possible,
but
there
would
not
be
the
hudson
fees
added
on
later.
so,
it
may
work
out
to
be
essentially
a
wash.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
and
as
we
have...
as
i
have
indicated,
justice
white,
we
would
not
be
opposed
to
such
a
ruling.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
yes.
we
want
to
win
at
all
times
on
behalf
of
our
clients.
[laughter]
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
that's
true.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
and
if
it's
limited,
then
it
isn't
true.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
that
is
true.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
well,
that's
the
second
reason.
the
first
reason
was
there
was
no
rule
58
judgment
entered
in
our
case--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--at
the
time--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--of
the
sentence
four
remand,
which
is
required.
it's
an
absolute
requirement
of
the
rule.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
and
therefore--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--that's
true,
and
that's
why
mr.
schaefer
prevails.
that's
the
first
reason
why
he
prevails.
the
second
reason
is
what
i
indicated--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--developments
in
the
law--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--right.
we
contend
the
statute
means
what
it
says,
that
when
you
make
your
application
for
fees,
you
must
show
at
that
time
that
you're
the
prevailing
party.
and
under
the
government's
scheme
that
is
not
possible.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
is
totally
impractical
and
unworkable.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
some
of
the
other--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--it
is
sometimes.
those
are
typically
sentence
six
remands.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
yes.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
well--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--in
a
sentence
four
case,
it
could
be
numerous
things.
it
could
be
a
lack
of
the
appropriate
experts
being
present.
it
could
be
an
improper
hypothetical
given
to
one
of
the
experts,
a
vocational
or
medical
witness.
it
could
be,
as
in
our
case,
the
failure
to
follow
the
eighth
circuit
law
relative
to
the
evaluation
of
pain
and
certain
factors
set
forth
in
the
circuit
case--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--no.
they
would
be
unjustified
if
they
failed
to
follow
the
legal
principles
set
forth
in
that
circuit,
such
as
in
our
case
where
there's
a
precedent
in
the
eighth
circuit
which
says
that
these
are
the
factors
you
must
look
to
to
evaluate
chronic
pain.
in
our
case
it
was
found
that
the
secretary
had
not
properly
followed
those
factors.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons...
one
of
the
legal
reasons
why
the
sentence
four
remand
was
given.
so,
sentence
four
has
lots
of
legal
aspects
to
it
which
i
think
would
be
relatively
easy
to
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
there
was
substantial
justification
at
that
point.
the
practicalities--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--no.
it
refers
to
the
denial
of
benefits
by
the
secretary.
typically
the
kind
of
analysis
that
the
federal
courts
engage
in
is
to
review
very
carefully
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge
which
becomes
the
final
decision
of
the
secretary
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
appropriate
legal
standards
were
followed.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
yes.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
that
is
true.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
yes.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
oh,
yes.
there
are
several
ways
in
which
the
position
could
be
found
unjustified.
the
practicalities
in
this
situation
strongly
favor
our
approach
as
opposed
to
the
government's
approach.
i
believe
the
court
has
a
good
understanding
of
what
the
government's
approach
entails.
let
me
highlight
some
of
the
practical
problems
with
it.
the
first
is
that
their
scheme
is
the
ultimate
in
setting
traps
for
the
unwary.
they
have
indicated
that
a
conditional
filing
must
be
made
shortly
after
the
sentence
four
remand
is
issued
by
the
district
court.
they
don't
indicate
what
documents
they
would
deem
necessary
at
that
time.
they
don't
indicate
what
would
have
to
be
filed.
it
is
very
possible
that
district
courts
for
failure
to
fulfill
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
eaja
statute,
particularly
the
showing
of
prevailing
party
status,
the
showing
of
the
specific
amount
of
fees
requested
and
so
forth,
could
dismiss
those
type
of
premature
petitions
as
being
inappropriate
under
the
plain
language
of
the
eaja
statute.
i
think
what
the
government's
approach
invites
is
a
potential
of
a
multiplicity
of
litigation
and
further
appeals
and
so
forth
dealing
with
what
the
proper
filings
would
be
under
a
conditional
type
filing
theory,
as
the
government
urges.
in
addition,
the
amount,
which
justice
o'connor
asked
about,
of
needless
filings
that
would
be
required.
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
we
cite
the
1990
statistics
in
which
there
were
over
4,300
remands
nationwide
from
district
courts
to
the
secretary.
38
percent
of
those
claimants
lost
on
remand.
so,
when
you
analyze
those
figures,
at
least
1,600
of
those
petitions
that
would
have
had
to
have
been
filed
were
superfluous
or
unnecessary
and
were
clogging
up
the
district
court
dockets.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
mr.
kelley
is
citing
some
figures
that
are
a
little
bit
more
recent
than
the
1990
figures.
in
1991,
the
total
number
of
remands
nationwide
went
down
to
2,526,
and
the
percentage
of
claimants
which
lost
on
remand
went
down
a
little
bit
to
about
a
third
at
that
time.
i
think
that
he
attempts
to
minimize
the
nationwide
impact
by
breaking
it
down
to
21
or
whatever
per
judicial
district
when,
in
fact,
you
have
to
look
at
the
nationwide
effect
because
they're
not
necessarily
spread
out
on
an
average
basis
among
judicial
districts.
the
secretary
is
concerned
about
delay.
let's
talk
about
delay
because
they
contend
that,
under
the
present
system
and
the
approach
urged
by
our
side,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
there
is
this
great
potential
for
delay.
first
of
all,
there's
no
evidence
that
claimants
or
their
counsel
have
been
dilatory
or
routinely
delayed
these
type
of
filing.
in
fact,
even
as
the
secretary
concedes
today,
there
is
a
tremendous
incentive
on
the
part
of
claimants
and
their
counsel
to
get
these
in
and
to
get
the
fees
paid
as
quickly
as
possible.
under
the
government's
theory,
you'd
have
to
first
file
this
conditional
application
for
fees.
you
would
then
have
to
go
back
and
go
through
the
remand
proceedings
before
the
secretary,
but
then
significantly,
the
government's
theory
contains
no
mechanism
for
triggering
any
further
time
limits
upon
the
claimant
or
their
counsel
to
come
back
to
court
and
file
for
those
fees.
under
their
theory,
assuming
that
there
was
the
incentive
to
delay,
which
we
deny,
the
claimant
and
their
counsel
could
wait
forever
before
coming
back
and
having
the
district
court
finally
act
upon
those
fee
petitions.
under
our
system,
it's
very
simple.
once
the
administrative
process
is
complete,
the
secretary
herself,
if
she's
concerned
about
delay,
can
come
in
and
simply
file
a
motion
for
entry
of
final
judgment,
which
will
automatically
trigger
that
eaja
time
limit
to
start
running.
therefore,
the
secretary
under
our
theory
has
within
her
own
power
the
power
to
limit
the
untimely
applications
that
she
fears
would
be
coming.

two-thirds.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
it
really
varies
widely
from
case
to
case,
frankly,
justice
scalia.
the
averages...
and
we
cited
some
of
the
statistics
in
our
brief.
the
average
length
of
time
that
elapses
from
a
remand...
and
again,
this
isn't
broken
down
sentence
four
versus
sentence
six.
but
the
average
length
of
time
is
13.9
months
from
the
time
the
court
orders
the
remand
until
you
know
whether
you
won
or
lost
in
the
administrative
process.
and
in
my
experience,
it
varies
greatly
from
a
year
and
a
half,
possibly
as
short
as
6
months
in
some
cases.
it
just
depends
upon
the
individual
calendars
and
dockets
of
the
administrative
hearing
judges
that
hear
these
cases.
so,
tremendous
delay
is
going
to
ensue
under
the
government's
theory,
and
there's
no
need
to
have
these
useless,
superfluous
fee
petitions
sitting
before
the
district
court
judges
and
magistrates
for
a
year
or
so
on
the
average
until--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--that's
what
the
holdings
are
at
this
point.
the
claimant
cannot
appeal
that
sentence
four
remand,
and
therefore
it's
not
a
final
appeal.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
that's
true,
until
the
case
is
over.
and
that
goes
back
to
the
intent
of
the
eaja
statute.
and
what
justice
scalia
was
focusing
on
earlier--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--assuming
that
the
remand
is
the
victory,
makes
us
the
prevailing
party?
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
well,
then
that
makes
it
very
easy,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
if
i
had
my
druthers,
in
the
perfect
world
i
would
say
that
the
existing
system
should
continue
and
the
reason
being
that
when
you
look
at--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--in
a
sentence
four
or
sentence
six?
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
okay.
i
think
that
we
should
continue
the
way
things
are
at
the
present
time,
and
here's
why.
because
when
you
talk
about
the
prevailing
party
status,
that
gets
into
the
question
of
fees
and
benefits.
and
at
the
present
time--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--well,
i'm
trying
not
to
analyze
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
i'm
going
to
get.
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i'm
trying
to
analyze
it
from
the
perspective--
[laughter]
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
i'm
trying
to
analyze
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
social
security
claimant
whose
fees
or
whose
abilities
financially
are
very
limited
by
definition.
and
the
claimant
is
affected
by
the
eaja
fee
process.
he's
affected
because,
as
we
did
in
our
case,
for
example,
we
waited
until
the
contingency
fee
was
fixed,
the
406(b)
fee,
and
then
we
came
in
and
asked
the
court
to
award
the
eaja
fee
in
addition
to
that
so
that
the
court
could
compare
those
two
fees
and
see--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--that
the
proper
refund
was
given
to
mr.
schaefer,
which
he
was
refunded
the
less...
would
be
refunded,
if
we
are
successful,
the
lesser
amount,
which
is
the
eaja
fee
amount
in
this
case--
mr.
randall
j.
fuller
--on
the
basis
of
what's
good
for
the
claimants,
yes.
we
contend
in
the
final
analysis
that
the
system
urged
by
the
secretary,
the
change
in
the
existing
practice,
is
unworkable
and
impractical
and
does
not
give
effect,
as
the
present
system
and
as
our
approach
does,
to
the
intent
and
the
plain
language
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
on
that
basis,
the
lower
court
decision
should
be
affirmed
and
the
award
of
eaja
fees
in
the
amount
of
$1,372.50
to
my
client,
mr.
schaefer,
should
be
affirmed.
