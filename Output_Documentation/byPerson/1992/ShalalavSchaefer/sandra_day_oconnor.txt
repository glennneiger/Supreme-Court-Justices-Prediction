justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
mr.
kelley,
i
think
that
in
the
hudson
case,
which
was
the
first,
that
the
government
conceded
there
was
no
final
judgment
for
equal
access
to
justice
act
purposes
until
the
administrative
proceeding
on
remand
was
concluded.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
melkonyan
certainly
said
it
wasn't
overturning
hudson.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
sentence
six.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
just
what
is
it
you
think
that
one
of
these
social
security
claimants
should
do
who
wants
to
have
an
eaja
claim?
i
mean,
it's...
there
has
to
be
some
way
to
work
this
out.
congress
intended
under
eaja
that
these
claimants,
if
the
government's
position
was
substantially
unjustified,
are
going
to
recover
their
costs.
and
just
how
is
it
you
think
this
is
going
to
work?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
time
of
the
remand,
they
don't
know
whether
they're
going
to
obtain
benefits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
kelley,
the
first
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
have
a
different
view,
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what's
the
matter
with
that
view?
they
presume
an
intent
in
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
some
express
indication
to
the
contrary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
certainly
were
concerned
in
finkelstein
with
the
right
of
the
government
to
raise
its
arguments--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
that
stage.
we
weren't
dealing
with
the
claimant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
conceivable
that
the
judgment
is
final
for
one
side
and
not
the
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
kind
of
odd.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
sounds
pretty
unworkable.
i
mean,
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these
claims,
and
you're
proposing
that
people
who
have
no
idea
whether
they're
going
to
prevail
at
the
end
of
the
line
have
to
file
these
things,
and
the
district
court
has
to
sit
on
them.
and
we
have
some
amicus
briefs
that
say
about
40
percent
of
those
who
get
a
remand
never
get
benefits
and
never
become
a
prevailing
party.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this
thing
sounds
to
me
like
a
real
bureaucratic
nightmare
that
you
want
us
to
institute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
to
make
a
holding
on
what
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
maybe
at
that
juncture,
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
maybe
at
that
point,
the
claimant
is
entitled
to
seek
eaja
fees
for
the
court
proceeding
that
resulted
in
a
sentence
four
remand
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
so,
what's
the
consequence
of
that
if
we
were
to
so
hold?
it
would
mean
in
this
case
your
client
would
fail
because
no
application
was
made
on
a
timely
basis
at
the
end
of...
at
the
time
of
the
order
of
remand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
correct?
i
mean,
can
it
be
demonstrated
that
the
claimant
has
prevailed
insofar
as
the
district
court
action
is
concerned
at
the
time
the
claimant
gets
an
order
for
remand?
you've
prevailed
to
that
extent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
that
certainly
is
a
potentially
workable
theory.
what's
the
effect
of
that
for
other
claimants,
not
yours?
let's
talk
about
other
claimants.
it
would
mean
then
that
there
would
be
no
eaja
fees
obtainable
for
the
administrative
work
after
the
remand
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
but
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted
and
i
think
others,
the
court
has
limited
hudson
and
has
distinguished
between
section...
sentence
four
and
sentence
six
remands.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
it
means
the
government
may
end
up
paying
more
in
fees
because
it
will
be
paying
fees
even
though
the
claimant
might
lose
ultimately.
