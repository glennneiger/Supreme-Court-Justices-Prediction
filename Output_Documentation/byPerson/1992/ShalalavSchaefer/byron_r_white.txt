justice
byron
r.
white
--you
say
that
there's
just
no
fee
allowable
for
attorney's
fees
and
other
expenses
before
the
agency--
justice
byron
r.
white
--either...
or...
either
initially
or
on
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
tell
me
again
how...
under
2412(d)(1)(b),
how
does
the
party
applying
for
a
fee
within
the
30
days
show
that
he
is
a
prevailing
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
he's
a...
he
has
prevailed
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
but
then...
and
he
has
to
show
that
he
is
eligible
to
receive
an
award
under
this
subsection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
he
show
it
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
can't
the...
well,
why
can't
then...
why
couldn't
a
fee...
the
fee
be
immediately
awarded?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
to
actually
prevail
at
the
agency
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
certainly
can't
show
that
you
are
a
prevailing
party
in
that
sense--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
you
don't...
you
have
no
idea
whether
you're
going
to
win
or
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
have
to
sort
of,
as
justice
scalia
said,
make
mishmash
out
of
this
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
i
mean,
you
either...
it
looks
like
you
would
either
have
to
ignore
the
30
days
from
final
judgment
rule
or
play
games
with
the
word
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a...
you
have
to
do
something
with
the
first
part
of
this
provision
or
the
last
part
of
the
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government
wins
on
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
can
your
position
be
unjustified?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the...
justice
scalia's
suggestion,
which
is
very
attractive
since
it's
so
simple,
but
it
also
would
involve
deciding
here,
which
has
never
been
decided
here
before--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
you're
not
entitled
to
fees
on
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
not...
but
we've
never
decided
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
some
other
courts
decided
that
they
are
entitled
to
remand
in
a
sentence
four
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
entitled
to
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
court
of
appeals
that
holds
that
you
don't
have
to
be
a...
to
win
below
to
be
a
prevailing
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
a
lot
of
courts
of
appeals
that
say
that
you
do
have
to
prevail
below--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
be
a
prevailing
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
you
would
embrace
justice
scalia's
proposal
if
you
assume
that
you're
not
going
to
get
fees
for
your
work
after
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
if...
i
would
think
you
would
just
like
to
be
able
to
collect
fees
immediately
and...
because
your
fee
won't
depend
on
whether
or
not
you
win
below,
but
you
will
still
want
to
win
below
for
your...
on
behalf
of
your
client.
