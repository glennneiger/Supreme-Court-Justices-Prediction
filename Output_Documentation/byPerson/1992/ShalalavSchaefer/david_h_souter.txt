justice
david
h.
souter
it
can
also
be
held
in
abeyance
for
the
duration
of
life
on
this
planet
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
isn't
the
problem
there
that
if
you
do
that,
you
have
no
time
limit
disciplining
the
point
at
which
the
claimant
has
got
to
come
in
for
the
fees?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
there's
a
third
possibility
in
which
the
claimant
who
cannot
at
the
point
of
remand
certify
that
he
is
entitled
as
a
winner,
that
the
claimant,
in
effect,
is
going
to
take
the
benefit
of
the
tolling
of
the
statute
until
the
prevailing...
his
prevailing
party
status
is
clear,
and
then
the
30
days
runs.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
it
be...
i'm
sorry.
no,
you
go
ahead.
i
was
going
to
say
why
would
it
be
an
inchoate
time.
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
determine
it
in
relation
to
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
