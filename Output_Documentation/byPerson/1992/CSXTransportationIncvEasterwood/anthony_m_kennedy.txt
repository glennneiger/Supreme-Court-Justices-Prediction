justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
what
time,
at
what
date
was
the
state
law
on
grade
crossings
preempted
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
was
at
the
time
of
the
first
regulation
was
issued?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
did
that
regulation
require?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
there
there
was
going
to
be
a
lapse
between
the
time
the
state
could
implement
its
program
and
the
time
when
the
railroads
might
begin
withdrawing
from
this
field.
don't
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
i
think
we
should
identify
the
point
at
which
preemption
occurred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
railroad
knows
that
the
main
road
is
closed
and
that
a
lot
of
school
buses
are
taking
a
detour
over
an
unmarked
crossing.
does
the
railroad
have
a
duty
to
slow
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
snowstorm,
fog,
no
duty
to
slow
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
see
the
school
bus
stalled.
do
they
have
a
duty
to
slow
down
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
the
regulations
talk
about
a
lookout
problem,
or
is
this
something--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why?
can
you
tell
me
why
that
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
when
a
lookout
problem
begins
and
when
a
speed
problem
ends.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
the
federal
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--ms.
mahoney,
doesn't
the
federal
government--
--let
her
finish
her
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
mahoney,
does
the...
are
you
finished
with
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
state
have
an
obligation
under
federal
statutes
to
make
a
survey
of
all
grade
crossings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
state,
the
state
of
georgia,
i
take
it,
has
undertaken
that
survey,
has
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
that
common...
under
your
view,
i
take
it,
every
municipality
in
the
state
of
georgia
could
pass
a
speed
limit
for
trains
passing
through
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
cases
held
what
was
preempted?
that
the
local
ordinances--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
the
local
ordinances
were
invalid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
what
is
your
position
if
a
municipality
passes
an
ordinance
regulating
the
speed
of
trains.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
different
municipalities
could
have
different
speed
limits
in
the
state
of
georgia.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
position
if
a
grade
crossing
has
been
improved
with
the
crossing
gate
using
federal
funds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
pardon
me.
let's
say
crossing
lights
using
federal
funds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
your
answer
is
no
preemption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
federal
funds--
--excuse
me.
are
federal
funds
used
to
conduct
the
survey?
