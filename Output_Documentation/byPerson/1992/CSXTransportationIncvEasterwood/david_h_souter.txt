--mr.
trienens,
i'm
having
a...
i
guess
a
different
problem
about
identifying
the
scope
of
the
subject
matter,
and
let
me
just
give
an
example.
this
is
not
the
only
one
that
i
have
in
mind,
but
let
me
just
give
this
as
an
example.
with
respect
to
those
cases
in
which,
as
i
understand
it,
federal
funds
are
used
to
improve
the
condition
of
the...
the
safety
conditions
at
a
grade
crossing,
and
it
is
determined
i
guess
in
accordance
with
the
manual
that
some
kind
of
a
device
should
be
installed,
as
i
understand
the
reg,
the
reg
provides
that
the
device
is
to
include
automatic
gates.
well,
the
provision
that
it
should
include
automatic
gates
leaves
open...
in
fact,
it
seems
to
imply...
that
other
devices
and
other
means
of
warning
might
be
appropriate
and
might
be
imposed,
which
i
assume
refers
back
to
imposed
under
state
law.
and
i
further
assume,
since
i
don't
see
anything
to
the
contrary,
that
it
does
not...
that
that
assumption
does
not
distinguish
between
state
law
in
the
sense
of
law
under
which
the
state
as
a
government
might
decide
what
the
devices
should
be
or
state
law,
such
as
common
law
or
tort
law,
which
might
decide
the
duty
incumbent
on
the
railroad
which
they
could
only
satisfy
by
certain
devices.
so
with
respect
to
that
particular
example,
doesn't
the
regulation
itself
imply
that
there
is
going
to
be
some
state
law
relating
to
the
safety
at
the
grade
crossing
which
survives
even
that
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it
imply
a
responsibility
as
opposed
simply
to
a
remaining
power?
we
don't
know
what
the...
we
can't
tell
what
the
responsibility
is
for
the
reg,
and
it
seems
to
leave
it
simply
open,
and
i
suppose
the
answer
would
have
to
be
an
answer
under
state
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
assuming
that,
isn't
it
still...
number
one,
your
argument
basically
is
that
by
placing
a
responsibility
on
a
state
or
local
agency,
that
that
is
a
regulation
on
the
subject
matter
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
and
i
guess
i
still
have
the
problem
that
later
and
more
detailed
regulations
seem
to
suggest
that
more
has
been
left
open
than
your
argument
would
conclude.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we
know
that
the
subject
matter
is
the
subject
matter
of
all
state
rules
affecting
safety
at
grade
crossings
as
opposed
to
state
rules
or
simply
rules
affecting
the
need
for
devices,
which
is
simply
a
subset
of
the
former?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
i
have
a
problem
that
goes
one
step
beyond
justice
stevens',
and
again
it's
a
textual
problem.
the
regulation
on
speed...
it
was
at
213.9...
speaks
simply
in
terms
of
the
maximum
allowable
speed
which
again,
by
its
terms,
seems
to
imply
to
me
that
there
may
be
some
source
of
authority
that
could
appropriately
set
a
speed
as
appropriate,
but
less
than
that
which
is
allowable,
which
again
implies
that
there
is
some
state
authority
left
to
do
this.
