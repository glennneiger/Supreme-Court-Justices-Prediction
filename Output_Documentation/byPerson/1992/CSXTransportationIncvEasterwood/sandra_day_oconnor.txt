well,
does
the
manual
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
plaintiff's
theory
include
a
failure...
a
theory
that
somehow
the
railroad
failed
to
identify
the
existence
of
a
hazardous
crossing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
to
at
least
identify
and
call
to
the
attention
of
the
state
authorities
the
hazards?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
that
give
rise
to
a
state
law
defense
in
the
cause
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
excuse
me.
do
you
think
it
would
give
rise
to
a
state
law
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
the
railroad?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
mahoney,
on
the
grade
crossing
area--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
should
we
view
the
manual
on
uniform
traffic
control
devices
which
says
the
determination
of
need
and
selection
of
devices
at
a
grade
crossing
is
made
by
the
public
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so,
could
there
be
a
state
tort
law
obligation
on
the
railroad
then
to
identify
the
need?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
ms.
mahoney,
this
manual
on
uniform
traffic
control
devices
is
not
speaking
about
federally
funded
projects.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
says
the
determination
of
need
and
selection
of
devices
at
a
grade
crossing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
made
by
the
public
agency--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
take
it,
meaning
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
is
certain
state
responsibility--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--imposed
by
federal
regulation.
