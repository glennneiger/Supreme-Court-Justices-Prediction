ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
first
time
in
20
years
that
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
interpret
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
frsa,
and
we'd
like
to
make
three
basic
points
about
how
we
think
that
it
needs
to
be
interpreted.
and
the
first
is
that
we
share
the
view
of
the
parties
that
434
should
not
be
interpreted
to
preempt
common
law
tort
actions
against
railroads
for
violations
of
their
duties
to
operate
trains
in
a
safe
manner.
second,
we
think
that
it
is
also
important,
however,
to
recognize
that
under
the
language
when
the
secretary
has
covered
the
subject
matter
of
a
railroad's
duty,
that
standard
of
care
must
govern.
it
is
a
federal
standard
of
care
defining
the
railroad's...
the
content
of
the
railroad's
safety
obligations
under
the
circumstances
that
must
control
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases.
so,
the
critical
question
becomes
whether,
in
fact,
the
secretary
has
covered
the
subject
matter
of
the
particular
claims
that
are
at
issue.
as
to
those
claims,
on
the
grade
crossing
issue,
we
do
not
think
that
the
regulations
cover
the
subject
matter
of
these
claims.
on
the
speed
issue,
we
think
that
they
do,
and
let
me
explain
why.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
we
do
not
disagree
that
the
determination
has
to
be
made
by
the
public
agency.
what
this
is
referring
to
is
final
authority.
it
has
always
been
the
case--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--absolutely,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
way
the
manual
works,
it's
simply
talking
about
the
system
that's
in
place.
we
have
to
recognize
that
when
we're
dealing
with
grade
crossings,
although
the
railroad
has
the
right-of-way
across
the
tracks,
the
highway
is
there
as
well,
and
the
state
has
to
have
authority
over
whether
a
gate
arm
is
going
to
be
installed
on
its
highway.
it
can't
allow
railroads
to
go
and
put
up
gate
arms
because
they
think
it's
good
for
safety.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
we
don't
see
what
you...
we
do
not
see
anywhere
in
the
statutes
or
the
regulations
that
say
that
it
is
the
state's
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
grade
crossings
are
safe.
in
fact--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
different
than
the
mutcd.
now
we're
talking
about
the
federal
funding
program,
and
yes,
to
use
federal
funds,
they
have
a
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
federal
funds
are
used
properly
to
survey
and
prioritize
projects
for
the
use
of
those
federal
funds.
the
language
of
the
regulations
and
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
speak
in
any
way
to
what
the
state's
obligations
are
with
respect
to
grade
crossings
that
are
not
improved
with
federal
funds.
and,
in
fact,
the
regulation,
646.210,
specifically
says
that
state
laws
that
govern
the
railroad's
share
of
grade
crossing
improvements
shall
not
be
applied
when
there
are
federal
aid
projects.
the
clear
import
of
that
language
is
that
state
laws
requiring
railroads
to
pay
for
grade
crossing
improvements,
to
undertake
the
duty
to
do
so,
are
still
in
place.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
unless...
only
when
federal
funds
are
being
used.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
not
under
federal
law.
under
state
law,
they
ordinarily
do,
but
not
under
federal
law.
the
federal
government
did
not
say
as
a
condition
of
getting
federal
funds,
you
must
go
out
and
implement
improvement
projects
at
grade
crossings
that
you're
not
going
to
use
federal
funds
for.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that
would
be
a
pennhurst
problem.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'm
sorry.
under
pennhurst,
to
say
to
the
states
that
you
now
will
share
all
of
the...
you
will
have
the
entire
responsibility
for
improving
grade
crossings
throughout
your
state,
you'll
not
only
have
to
pay
for
them,
but
you'll
have
to
assume
whatever
tort
liability
there
is,
would
be
a
condition
that
is
certainly
not
explicit
in
the
federal
funding
statute.
we
have
consistently
interpreted
that,
the
federal
funding
provisions,
to
apply
solely
to
federally
funded
projects.
the--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
does.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
this
was
adopted
by
virtue
of...
the
history
is
important
here.
a
bulletin
in
1977
adopted
this,
incorporated
into
part
of
the
manual.
and
we
think
that
our
interpretation
is
perfectly
consistent.
in
other
words,
need
and
selection.
a
railroad
identifies
a
hazardous
crossing.
it
comes
to
the
state
as
every
citizen
must
do
when
it
needs
approval,
and
it
says
i
need
a
gate
arm
here.
the
state
has
to
determine
whether
a
gate
arm
is
needed
there
and
whether
it's
appropriate
to
have
it
installed.
that's
what
this
language
speaks
to.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
state--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
it
doesn't
say
that
the
state
must
go
out
on
its
own
and
determine
what
crossings
need
to
be
improved.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
has
a
financial
responsibility
or
duty
to
go
out
and
do
that.
that
was
left
to
state
law,
and
in
fact,
even
in
the
'89
report
to
congress,
the
secretary
was
quite
clear
that
the
extent
of
responsibilities,
the
joint
responsibility,
for
improving
grade
crossings
still
rested
with
the
states.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
to
get
federal
funds,
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
required
to
use
that
survey
for
implementing
projects
that
are
not
federally
funded.
it
is
solely
so
that
the
federal
monies
can
be
used
in
an
appropriate
way.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
it
has.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
for
the
fun
of
it.
it's
so
that
when
federal
monies
are
used,
there
can
be
a
determination
about
where
they
ought
to
be
used
within
the
state.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
you
can't--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
how
can
you
decide
which
ones
you're
going
to
use
it
on,
if
the
whole
point
is
you
want
to
prioritize,
unless
you
survey
all
of
them?
yes,
they
have
to
survey
them,
but
we
do
not
tell
them,
unlike...
contrary
to
what
the
railroads
have
said,
we
do
not
tell
them
what
hazard
index
they
have
to
use,
how
they
have
to
rank
them,
and
we
certainly
don't
tell
them--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--we're
talking
about
under
the
mutcd.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
right.
the
mutcd
says
nothing
can
be--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--nothing
can
be
installed
on
a
public
roadway
unless
the
responsible
local
authority
says
that
it's
appropriate.
that
is
true
not
only
with
respect
to
crossing
devices,
but
also
with
respect
to
every
kind
of
stop
sign
that
a
business
may
want
to
have
at
its
corner
or
at
its
driveway.
all
determinations
of
this
kind--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
right.
no
one
determines
needs
under
those
circumstances
except
that
under
state
law,
the
regulatory
authorities
do
assume
responsibility
for
this.
so,
the
problem
that
we're
describing,
it
doesn't
really
happen,
but
it
occurs
under
the
regime
of
state
law,
not
under
federally
mandated
duties.
we
are
not
telling
the
states
that
they
must
improve
their
federal...
their
grade
crossings
without
the
use
of
federal
funds.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
throughout
the
history
of
this
problem,
that
the
reports
to
congress
that
the
secretary
has
done
have
been
quite
clear
that
this
is
the
scheme
that
was
in
place
before
the
funding
statutes
were
enacted
or
supplemented
in
1973,
and
did
not
recommend
any
changes
in
that
existing
scheme.
in
the
'89
report,
for
instance,
3-1,
that
was
submitted
to
congress,
the
secretary
specifically
said
that
the
railroads'
responsibilities
are
governed
by
federal
standards
when
federal
funds
are
used,
but
otherwise
there
is
joint
responsibility
at
the
crossings,
and
that
that
is
not
necessarily
a
wrong
concept.
we
do...
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
