mr.
trienens,
are
you
going
to
talk
at
all
about
the
speed
issue?
i
have
one
question
or
two
questions
about
that
if
you're
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
if
the
train
went
70...
went
over
the
speed
limit?
would
that
be
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
state
law?
could
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
could
be
covered.
and
what
if
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
the
local...
that
the
speed
that
the
train
traveled
at
was
incompatible
with
essentially
a
local
hazard?
what...
how
does
that
play
out
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
what
would
be?
what
if
the
plaintiff
thought
that
because
of
the
dense
population
and
a
lot
of
bushes
around
or
something
that
the
60-mile-an-hour
limit
was
dangerous?
is
there
any
way...
is
that...
is
a
claim
of
that
kind
preempted,
or
how
does
that
play
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
a
gate
problem,
just
that
because
of
the
particular
local
conditions,
the
60-mile-an-hour
speed...
it
seems
to
me
you
could
read
the
statute
as
saying
the
speed
limit
is
not
always
going
to
be...
there
could
be
an
essentially
local
safety
hazard
which
would
indicate
that
a
lower
rate
of
speed
would
be
necessary
to
avoid
the
danger
at
that
local
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
could
apply
even
in
a
jury
trial,
even
without
a
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
more
stringent
law,
rule,
regulation,
order,
or
standard.
that
can't
be
by
adjudication
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you're
right
about
that.
supposing
they
had
adequate...
the
gates
went
down.
when
the
gates
are
down
and
the
lights
are
flashing,
how...
why
do
you
care
how
fast
the
train
is
going?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
perhaps
the
protection
against
the
particular
accidents
you
describe
must
rely
on
the
crossing
problem
rather
than
the
speed
of
the
train.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
crossing
is
adequately
protected,
i
don't
know
why,
if
i'm
sitting
there
in
my
car,
i
wouldn't
rather
have
the
train
go
by
real
fast
rather
than
slow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
speed
issue,
but...
your
answer.
i
thought
their
position
was
they
could
go
60
miles
an
hour.
