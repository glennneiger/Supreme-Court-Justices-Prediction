chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
can
we
find
this
in
your
brief,
mrs.
colston?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
the
statute
is
drawn
very
narrowly,
mrs.
colston?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
either
a
narrow
or
a
broad
statute.
it
strikes
me
as
a
fairly
common
preemption
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
exactly
the
language
i'm
referring
to,
and
i'm
telling
you
i
don't
see
how
you
can
classify
that
as
a
narrow
preemption
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
colston,
were
there
federal
funds
involved
in
the
site
of
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
my
question
was
were
federal
funds
involved
at
the
site
in
this
case.
surely
you
can
give
a
simpler
answer
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
accident
occurred
at
cook
street?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank

mrs.
colston.

trienens,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
trienens.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
have
another
opinion
to
announce
which
i
ommitted
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
