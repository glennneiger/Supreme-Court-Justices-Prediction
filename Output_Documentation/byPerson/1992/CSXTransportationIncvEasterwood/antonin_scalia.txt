justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem--
--go
on.
i'm
just
pressing
justice
kennedy's
point.
i
think
it
is
an
important
point
because
although
it's
time
past
and
it's
not
involved
in
this
case,
it
does
bear
upon
whether
your
interpretation
of
when
the
preemption
occurs
is
a
reasonable
one.
your
interpretation
leaves
a
time
period,
namely
the
period
after
the
promulgation
of
that
regulation
imposing
upon
the
states
the
obligation
to
make
that
decision
of
what
kind
of
mechanism
you
use
and
the
point
at
which
the
state
actually
issues
such
a
decision
with
respect
to
each
crossing.
during
that
time
period,
there's
no
regulation
by
anybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--railroads,
state,
federal,
nobody.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
during
that
lapsed
period--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if...
during
that
period,
after
the
promulgation
of
that
regulation,
if
there
were
an
accident
at
a
rail
crossing,
the
person
injured
would
not
be
able
to
sue
the
railroad
because
it
was
no
longer
the
railroad's
responsibility
to
guard
the
crossing
by
some
device,
nor
could
he
sue
the
state
because
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
couldn't
sue
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
statute
had
just
been
passed.
you
have
to
give
the
state
a
reasonable
time.
the
state
is
certainly
not
negligent
in
failing
to
do
it
yesterday.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
talking
about
an
accident
that
occurred
a
week
after,
a
week
after
this
regulation.
whose
fault--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
trienens,
why
don't...
why
isn't
a
better
explanation
of
what
you're
arguing
for
that
this
is
conflict
preemption?
i
have
the
same
trouble
that
justice
souter
does,
squeezing
this
within
the
terms
regulation,
order,
or
standard
relating
to
railroad
safety.
i
mean,
there's
no
standard
contained
in
that
regulation.
it
just
allocates
the
responsibility
for
issuing
the
standard.
now,
i
can...
if
you're
making
the
argument
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
placing
that
responsibility
upon
the
state
itself
to
instead,
by
state
common
law,
impose
that
responsibility
upon
the
railroad,
then
i
can
understand.
that's
a
conflict
preemption
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
sufficient
to
say
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
requirement
is
who's
responsible?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
strange
subject
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
authority
over
it,
ms.
mahoney,
but
not
responsibility
for
it.
the
regulation
does
not
simply
repeat
the
situation
in
place.
at
common
law,
the
state
has
no
responsibility
to
assure
the
safety
of
each
intersection.
the
state
has
the
final
word.
the
railroad
could
not
put
up
a
gate
or
a
flashing
signal
without
the
state's
consent.
but
it
seems
to
me
an
enormous
change
for
the
federal
government
to
say
henceforth
the
state
shall
have
a
positive
responsibility
to
assure
the
safety
of
these
intersections,
whereas
before
under
state
law,
it
was
the
railroad's
responsibility.
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
different
system
and
a
system
that
seems
to
me
in
conflict
with
the
old
common
law
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
say
that?
don't
they
have
a
responsibility
to
make
studies
and
to
determine
what
should
be
put
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
payment.
i'm
talking
about
responsibility
to
make
the
decision.
is
it
not
the
case
that
for
both
federally
funded
and
non-federally...
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
state
has
no
responsibility
under
the
regulations
to
inspect
grade
crossings
and
to
make
a
determination
of
what
safety
features
are
necessary
at
those
crossings
unless
federal
funds
are
being
used?
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
when
federal.
the
state
has
no
responsibility
to
inspect
other
crossings
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
position
is
that
they
are
required
to
survey
these
nonfunded
intersections
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
not
used.
i
mean,
why
can't...
they
would
save
a
lot
of
money
to
say
we
will
decide
in
advance
which
ones
we'll
use
federal
money
on
and
we'll
survey
those.
but
that's
not
what
this
says.
it
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
shall
survey
every
one
in
the
state.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
don't,
and
your
position
on
the
requirement
that
they
shall
determine
the
need
is
that
they
shall
determine
the
need
if
the
railroad
comes
and
says
there's
a
need.
otherwise,
they
have
no
responsibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
strange
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
may
be
a
need
when
no
one
asks
to
put
up
anything.
the
railroad
doesn't
ask
a
thing.
in
that
case,
nobody
determines
the
need.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
does
not
say
completely
cover
the
subject
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said...
it
says
it
has
to
be
a...
have
adopted
a
rule,
regulation,
order,
or
standard
covering
the
subject
matter
of
such
state
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
colston,
i
thought
about
this
when
i
was
reading
it.
do
these
speeds...
these
speeds
you
say
are
totally
determined
by
the
character
of
the
roadbed.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
mean
that
in
these
rail
yards
that
are
near
union
station
down
here
if
the
roadbed
is
good
enough,
the
speed
would
be
60
or
110?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
shown
that
way
on
the
national
maps,
that
if
you
want
to,
you
can
do
110
in
the
rail
yard?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
deny
that
the
secretary
could
do
that
if
he
wanted
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
here
is
just
that
this
particular
regulation
doesn't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
your...
i
mean,
you
acknowledge,
do
you
not,
that
if
the
secretary
wanted
to
establish
uniform
speed
limits
for
trains,
he
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
say
he
hasn't
done
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
safety
factor
too,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
not
everybody
is
as
patient
as
justice
stevens
and
would
sit
there
if
it
was
a
slow--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
jury
is
going
to
hold
a
railroad
liable
for
doing
everything
that
the
railroad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--come
on.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
they
have
to
survey
every
one
of
the
crossings
in
the
state.
right?
private
as
well
as
public
ones.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
the
private,
just
the
public
ones.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
can't
look
at
a
map
and
just
say,
well,
we
know.
you
know,
this
is
a
little
rinky
rural
road.
no
big
deal.
it's
hard
to
believe
that
every
crossing
was
required
to
be
examined
solely
in
order
to,
quote,
prioritize.
certainly
you
could
have
eliminated
80
percent
of
the
crossings
in
the
state
knowing
that
those
are
not
the
most
important
ones
where
you're
going
to
need
federal
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
allowed
to.
they
have
to...
under
the
regulations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
have
to
do
all
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
look
out.
you
just
don't
have
to
reduce
your
speed.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
it's
a
little
unfair
to
say
that
lookout
is
inconsistent
with
the
speed
limit.
i
mean,
you
have
a
speed
limit
of
30
miles
in
residential
areas,
let's
say.
certainly
that
doesn't
mean
if
you
see
a
pedestrian
walking
in
front
of
you,
you
can
maintain
your
30-mile
speed,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
you
slow
down
in
residential
areas
when
you're
driving
a
car--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
says
30
miles
or
25
miles
and
you
see
a
pedestrian.
you,
nonetheless,
slow
down,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you'd
say
what's
the
maximum
speed.
the
maximum
speed
is
25
or
30
miles
an
hour.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
they're
saying
here
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it's
the
difference
between
when
you're
on
an
interstate
highway
that
has
a
posted
speed
limit
of
55
and
there's
a
major
curve.
you
are
not
negligent
if
it's
good
weather
and
everything
else
is
okay
and
you
go
55
miles
an
hour.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
would
be
negligent
if
there
were,
you
know,
somebody
fallen
down
in
the
road
and
you
continued
at
that
same
speed.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
they're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
normal
track
conditions
allow
them
to
continue
to
go
at
whatever
that
speed
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
see
an
obstruction,
of
course,
they
have
the
duty
to
slow.
