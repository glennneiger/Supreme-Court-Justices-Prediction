mr.
howard
j.
trienens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
a
railroad
crossing
accident
in
which
respondent's
husband
died.
every
one
of
these
crossing
accidents
is
a
serious
matter,
and
when
the
number
of
accidents
reached
the
thousands
with
the
increase
in
highway
traffic,
this
became
a
matter
of
national
concern.
congress
faced
up
to
this
problem
in
the
federal
safety
act
of
1970.
it
authorized
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
issue
regulations
and
standards
for
all
areas
of
railroad
safety
and
it
directed
the
secretary
to
undertake
a
coordinated
effort
toward
solutions
to
the
grade
crossing
problem
under
his
authority
under
both
the
railway
safety
act
and
the
highway
legislation.
congress
went
further.
it
directed
that
the
secretary's
regulations
shall
be
nationally
uniform,
and
congress
provided
a
sweeping
preemption
provision
as
follows.
a
state
may
adopt
or
continue
in
force
any
law,
regulation,
order,
or
standard
relating
to
railroad
safety
until
such
time
as
the
secretary
has
adopted
a
rule,
regulation,
order,
or
standard
covering
the
subject
matter
of
such
state
requirement.
now,
the
until
such
time
language
was
to
avoid
a
lapse
in
responsibilities
between
the
time
the
statute
passed
and
the
regulations
were
issued.
in
1973,
congress
went
further.
it
passed
a
highway
safety
act
in
which
the
states
were
required
to
survey
all
highway
rail
crossings
and
implement
improvements.
now,
as
authorized
and
directed
by
congress,
the
secretary
has
issued
many,
many
regulations,
and
many
of
those
include
safety
at
grade
crossings.
as
to
each
such
regulation,
the
subject
matter
which
it
covers,
the
state
laws
covering
the
same
subject
matter
are
no
longer
in
force
under
section
434.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
1977.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
provided
that
the
responsibility
for
determining
the
selection
of
devices...
and
we're
talking
now
only
about
that
state
law
tort
duty,
not
all
of
them,
but
the
state
law
tort
duty
of
picking
a
reasonable
selection
of
a
device,
gate,
sign,
flashing
lights,
which
device
shall
be
done.
that
responsibility
was
placed
exclusively
upon
the
state
authorities.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
possibly.
i
think
the
literal
reading
of
this
and
the
practical
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
when
the
responsibility
shifted,
the
responsibility
shifted.
of
course,
this
is
now,
15,
20
years
ago.
so
the
problem
of
the
lapse
doesn't
apply
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
under
the
statute,
the
preemption
occurred
when
the
secretary
issued
a
regulation
covering
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
requirement.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
that's
what
congress
did,
and
that's
the
way
it
works.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
no.
the--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--the
question
is
who
has
got
the
responsibility
and
the
duty.
there
are
lots
of
duties
at
federal...
at
grade
crossings.
there's
a
duty
to
select
the
device.
there's
a
duty
to
maintain
the
device.
there's
a
duty
to
have
a
whistle,
a
duty
to
blow
a
whistle.
some
are
preempted,
some
aren't.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
no,
not
the--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--no.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
why?
why
not?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
these
things
didn't
happen
overnight.
the
statute
was
in
1970.
the
statute
putting
the
burden
on
the
states
was
in...
saying
that
they
should
be
responsible
was
in
1973.
this
regulation
was
proposed.
the
states
knew
about
it
for
4
years,
1977.
it
just
didn't
come
out
of
nowhere.
so,
this
isn't
a
question
of
all
of
a
sudden,
oh,
my
goodness,
i'm
responsible--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--it's
also
4
years
after
congress
passed
the
highway
safety
act
and
section
130
that
said
that
the
states
had
this
responsibility.
so,
the
answer
is
the
triggering
of
the
preemption
comes
at
the
time
the
secretary
issues
the
regulation.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
this
is
4
years
after
congress
had
said
the
states
should
have
this
responsibility.
so,
here's
4
years
in
which
they
could
gear
up
for
it.
there
is
no
problem
with
lapse
here,
certainly
not
applied
here.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
no.
what
it
does
imply
is
there
is
a
state
responsibility
to
select
and
determine
the
appropriate
device
at
each
crossing.
that
responsibility
is
a
responsibility
imposed
by
federal
law.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
because
the
reg
in
question...
you're
referring
to
i
believe
part
646
of
the
manual.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
one
i'm
talking
about
is
924
and
655.
the
one
i'm
talking
about
is
pursuant
to
section
130
of
the
railway...
of
the
highway
safety
act
of
'73
and
particularly
on
the
regulations,
which
are
the
regulations,
after
all,
which
trigger
the
preemption.
924
and
1204
are
the
ones
that
put
the
responsibility
on
the
states.
and
if
there
were
ever
any
doubt
about
that,
the
manual,
which
is
also
a...
part
655,
as
incorporated
in
the
cfr,
says
the
determination
of
need
and
selection
of
devices
at
grade
crossings
is
made
by
the
public
agency.
and
if
there's
any
doubt
about
that
one,
it
goes
on
in
a
later
section,
8(d),
and
says
under
the
heading
selection
of
systems
and
devices.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
a
regulation.
it's
a
regulation
and
a
standard.
it
so
says
in
the
cfr
issued
by
the
secretary.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
manual
and
the
way
the
states
wanted
it,
because
there
was
a...
there
was
an
effort
to
have
further
detail
and
elaborate
formulas
on
whether
gates
or
not
gates...
the
way
the
states
wanted
it,
knowing
they
had
this
responsibility,
was
to
say
there
was
a
variety
of
circumstances,
and
they
wanted
more
flexibility.
the
regulations
i'm
talking
about
not
only
impose
the
responsibility
for
selection
of
devices
upon
the
state
officials,
but
tells
them
how
to
go
about
it.
it
says
based
on
an
engineering
study
at
the
particular
crossing,
you
shall
decide
what's
appropriate.
and
then
in
case
you
were
wondering
whether
that
was
exclusive
responsibility,
the
regulation
also
says
traffic
control
devices
shall
be
placed
only
by
the
authority
of
a
public
body.
they
have
the
authority,
responsibility,
and
the
exclusive
responsibility.
now,
is
this...
what's
the
state
law
duty
we're
talking
about
here
that...
prior
to
preemption?
and
i
won't
invent
it
myself.
i'll
read
you
from
plaintiff's
brief.
it
says
the
railroad's
common
law
duty
is
determining
that
improved
grade
crossing
devices
are
needed
and
implementing
devices.
that's
the
common
law
duty
or
actually
georgia's
statutory
duty
which
they
would
impose
on
the
railroad.
now,
these
regulations
i've
been
reciting
put
exactly
that,
the
responsibility,
the
exclusive
responsibility
for
determining
the
need
for
a
device
and
implementing
the
device
on
the
state
authority.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
i'm
only
talking
now
about
the
duty
to
select
the
appropriate
device.
i'm
not
talking
about
lots
of
other
duties
that
a
railroad
has
at
a
crossing.
railroads
are
going
to
continue
to
be
sued
at
crossings,
and
in
fact,
of
the
five
issues
that
mrs.
easterwood
raised,
three
of
them
are
going
back
for
trial
or
disposition
in
the
trial
court
one
way
or
the
other.
whatever
this
court
does
on
the
two
narrow
duties
we're
talking
about,
this
case
goes
back
for
trial,
or
it
goes
back
for
further
proceedings
at
least,
on
the
three
duties
that
we
admit
are
duties
at
crossings
which
were
not
preempted.
or
at
least
there
was
no
claim
in
this
case
they
were
preempted,
and
it
goes
back.
we're
talking
about
the
duty
to
select
as
between
gates,
lights,
and
signs.
who
makes
that
determination?
the
plaintiff
says
under
georgia
law,
the
railroad
is
responsible.
the
secretary
has
issued
regulations
saying
that
the
states
are
exclusively
responsible.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
our
argument
in
our
brief
makes
both
the
conflict
point
and
the
point
that
the
434
covers
the
subject
matter.
it
certainly...
nobody
on
the
other
side
has
ever
argued
this
wasn't
a
matter
relating
to
railroad
safety,
whether
you
have
a
gate
or
a
sign
or
a
light.
that's
a
matter
relating
to
safety.
no
question
about
that.
the
question
is
whether
the
secretary
has
issued
a
regulation
covering
the
subject
matter,
and
he
has
covered
it
like
a
blanket
on
the
narrow
question
of
who
determines
whether
it's
a
gate
or
a
light.
he
covered
the
subject
matter.
how
can...
how
more
can
you
cover
it?
that's
why--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--that's
why
i
emphasized
that
point.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
no.
it's
more
than
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
no.
it's
more
than
that.
it's
not
only
who's
responsible,
but
how
you
go
at
it.
it
tells
the
state
how
to
go
at
deciding...
how
to
go
to
the
particular
grade
crossing
and
how
to
decide
whether
to
have
a
gate
or
not
have
a
gate.
it
tells
them
how
to
make
the
engineering
judgments.
your
question
is
whether
the
secretary
went
far
enough
in
the
detail.
you
know,
you
could
have
formulas.
there's
mathematical
formulas
that
people...
you
know,
if
there's
x
trains
times
y
trucks,
there
ought
to
be
a
gate,
and
if
not,
no
gate.
the
states
resisted
that
and
said
no,
no,
that
isn't
the
way
to
do
it.
the
way
you've
got
it
in
the
regulations
is
the
way
it
ought
to
be.
it
tells
them
what
to
do.
it
tells
them
who's
responsible,
and
it
tells
them
how
to
do
it.
what
more...
how
more
can
you
cover
it?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
i...
their
theory
apparently,
as
stated
in
their
brief,
is
that
the
railroad
had
the
responsibility...
and
presumably
implicitly
we
failed
to
perform
this
duty...
of
determining
that
improved
grade
crossing
devices
are
needed
and
to
implement
them.
in
other
words,
it
was
our
duty
to
decide
that
there
should
have
been
a
gate
there
and
we
didn't
do
it.
i
think
that's
their
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
they
make
that
point,
but
it's...
first
place,
if
it's
their
responsibility...
and
after
all,
the
railroads
work
with
these
people
all
the
time.
the
work...
the
railroads
do
have
an
obligation,
when
called
upon,
to
work
with
these
diagnostic
teams
that
go
out
to
each
of
these
crossings.
so,
the
railroads
are
on
top
of
this.
it
also
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
what
happened
here
was
there
was
a
diagnostic
team,
and
the
railroads
were
fully
in
on
it.
the
diagnostic
team
went
to
cartersville,
georgia.
it
went...
there
are
five
crossings
in
cartersville,
georgia.
they
went
and
they
looked
at
all
of
them,
and
they
said
all
right,
let's...
tentatively
let's
have
gates
at
all
of
them.
the
city
of
cartersville
said
wait
a
minute.
at
cook
street,
it's
too
wide.
you
got
to
build
an
island
in
the
middle
of
it
in
order
to
accommodate
a
gate.
putting
that
island
in
will
cause
a
hazard
to
trucks,
and
therefore,
the
state
authorities
who
are
responsible
for
selecting
devices
weighed
the
highway
safety
alone,
the
highway
safety
in
relation
to
the
railroads,
and
it
decided
at
cook
street
they
wouldn't
make
them
build
the
island.
they
would
have
flashing
lights,
in
fact,
six
flashing
lights
on
signs
and
booms,
and
that
they
decided...
they
decided...
that
there
would
not
be
gates
at
cook
street.
the
railroads
didn't
decide
this.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
what
it
does
give
rise
to
is
that
the
states
are
responsible.
the
states
are
not
immune.
the
secretary
has
made
a
survey
and
found
that
most
states
there's
no
immunity.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
to
whom?
the
railroad?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
know
because
all
i'm
concerned
about
here
is
the
fact
that
having
this
process,
having
the
federal
regulations
prescribing
the
process,
and
having
a
statute
that
says
that
when
you
cover
this
very
subject
matter,
it's
preempted,
we
don't
get
to
that.
they
say,
well,
you
know,
maybe
you
would
have
a
nice
state
law
defense,
and
maybe
a
jury
would
find
for
you.
but
on
this
narrow
issue,
this
is
not
for
a
state
court
or
a
state
jury.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the...
on
the
speed
issue,
that's
the
one
where
we
are
the
respondent.
the
court
below
found
there
was
preemption.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
on
preemption
on
that.
the
secretary
has
a
regulation
on
speed
that
has
the
allowable
speed
over
this
and
other
tracks.
we're
not
dealing
with
train
operations
generally.
we're
not
talking
about
lookout
here.
we're
talking
about
speed
alone,
and
also
speed
is
not
a
separate
subject.
speed
is
not
a
subject
separate
from
what
device
do
you
have
at
the
grade
crossing
because
they're
interrelated
under
the
secretary's
regulations.
but
any
event,
our
position
is
the
subject
matter
of
train
speeds
has
been
covered
and
it's
preempted.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
would
be
a
violation
of
federal
law,
but
you
could
sue
in
the
state
court
on
a
common
law
basis
under
a
case
justice
brennan
wrote
called
crane.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
this
regulation
and
the
railroad
would
be
subject
to
a
suit.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
local
hazard...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
solicitor
general,
we
all
agree.
the
local...
essentially
the
local
hazard
is
not
implicated
in
this
case
because
if
you
had
said
every
grade
crossing
is
a
local
crossing,
that
would
just
swallow
the
national
rule
that
they
got
out.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
preempted,
but
there's
the
city
of
cartersville.
if
they
thought
that
not
only
could
have
gone,
but
had
right
sitting
in
their
lap
gates
at
that
crossing
and
they
didn't
want
them.
but
if
they...
under
your
question,
if
a
city
thinks
there
ought
to
be
gates
there,
they
go
to
the
state
department
of
transportation
and
say
give
us
a
gate.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
if
a
state...
not
the
city,
but
if
a
state
were
to
come
along
and
say
because
there's
something
very
unusual
about
the
horseshoe
curve...
and
i
picked
that
because
that's
in
the
legislative
history...
and
therefore,
somehow
there
ought
to
be
a
special
speed
limit
there,
then
i
think...
then
that
local
exception
would
apply,
but
nobody
has
tried--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--no.
no,
no.
it
has
got
to
be
a
state
who
identifies
something
extraordinary
and
then
has
a
statewide--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--no.
it
has
got
to
be
a
state
that
has
got
to
get
it
out.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
we
don't
agree
that
there's
any
such
implication,
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
has
a
number
of
motives,
one
of
which
is
to
get
the
trains
through.
congress
has
beaten
on
the
amtrak
to
speed
up
the
trains,
and
the
speed
is...
the
allowable
speed
is
the
speed
you're
allowed
to
go
at,
period,
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
that's
what
we
think
the
secretary...
regulations
call
for,
and
once
he
has
covered
that
subject
matter,
it's
preempted.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
railroad...
no,
no.
the
question
of
the--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--no.
they
got
a
duty
to
look
out,
but
not
as...
speed
as
such.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
a
lookout
question.
then
you
have
to
take
all
appropriate
measures
to
avoid
the
collision.
and
of
course,
there's
a
problem
there.
you
got
this
heavy
train
and
you
can't
swerve.
but,
yes.
oh,
i
don't
say
that
at
all.
we've
got
a
lookout
problem.
he
sees
the
bus.
he
has
got
to
everything
he
can--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--no.
that's
not
preempted.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
the
secretary,
not
having
issued
a
regulation
on
that,
the
state
law
continues
in
force.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
if
he's
going
at
the
allowable
speed,
he
looks,
and
under
your
question,
he
sees
a
school
bus
sitting
there,
he
has
got
to
take
every
step
to...
first,
he
has
got
to
maintain
an
adequate
lookout,
and
secondly,
he
has
got
to
take
every
feasible
step
to
avoid
the
accident.
that's
a
state
law
question,
not
preempted,
not
involved.
i
just
want
to
say
one
thing
about
this
federally
funded
problem
that
the
solicitor
general
injected
in
this
case
after
cert.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
under
434.
there's
no
basis
for
the
distinction,
and
it
produced
entirely
goofy
results.
if
you
have
three
crossings
identically
protected,
one
with
federal
funds,
one
previously
erected,
and
one
built
with
state
funds,
one
is
preempted.
two
aren't.
that
makes
no
sense
at
all.
besides
it's...
ironically,
all
of
them
in
this
case,
all
the
cartersville
ones
were
improved
with
federal
funds.
so
this
argument
created
for
this
case
doesn't
apply
to
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i'd
like
to
devote
that
entirely
to
the
confusion
on
federal
funding.
the
states,
as
everybody
knows,
get
a
lot
of
federal
money
for
all
kinds
of
purposes
on
the
highways,
and
the
states
accept
certain
responsibilities
to
get
all
that
money.
and
one
of
them
is,
imposed
in
the
1973
act,
each
state
shall
conduct
and
maintain
a
survey
of
all
highways,
to
identify
rail
crossings
which
may
require
separation
or
protective
devices,
and
establish
and
implement
a
schedule
of
projects
for
this
purpose.
states
have
done
that.
they
haven't
objected
to
it.
they're
doing
it.
the
federal
funds
it.
and
my
point
is
that
quite
apart
from
this
myopic
view
on
part
646,
that
this
requirement
is
now
embraced
not
only
in
the
statute,
but
also
in
the
federal
regs.
it's
in
924.
it's
in
1204.
these
are
regulations
and
they
trigger
the
preemption.
the
manual,
which
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
said,
oh,
that's
a
mere
bulletin...
it
is
a
regulation.
it's
in
the
cfr,
and
the
r
stands
for
regulation.
it's
described
in
the
cfr
as
a
regulation
and
a
standard,
and
it
specifically
puts
the
responsibility
for
this
narrow
question
of
who
determines
gates
or
no
gates
on
the
states.
period.
and
once
they
do
that,
434
kicks
in.
having
covered
that
narrow
subject
matter,
not
liability
generally
at
grade
crossings...
we'll
keep
getting
sued
every
time
there's
an
accident,
but
as
to
this
determination,
the
secretary
has
covered
that
subject
matter
and
that
preempts
expressly.
thank
you.
