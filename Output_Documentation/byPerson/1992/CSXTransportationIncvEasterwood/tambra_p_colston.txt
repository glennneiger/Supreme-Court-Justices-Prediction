ms.
tambra
p.
colston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
railroad
has
gained
numerous
benefits
already
from
the
federal
railroad
safety
act.
they
now
ask
this
court
to
benefit
you...
benefit
them
further
by
finding
that
two
traditional
common
law
duties
are
preempted.
and
we
have
to
get
to
the
subject
matter
of
what
is
preemptive
because
the
regulation
is
so
clear.
the
regulation
in
this
case,
section
434,
bears
repeating.
it
starts
out,
congress
declares--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--your
honor,
it
is
all
the
way
through
there.
at
the
very
beginning...
page
9,
your
honor,
at
the
very
bottom
it
begins.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
congress
declares
that
the
laws,
rules,
regulations,
orders,
and
standards
relating
to
railroad
safety
should
be
nationally
uniform
to
the
extent
practicable,
thus
beginning
the
section
with
a
recognition
that
all
laws
relating
to
railroad
safety
can't
be
completely
uniform.
then
the
second
section.
a
state
may
adopt
or
continue
in
force
any
law,
rule,
regulation,
order,
or
standard
relating
to...
relating
to...
railroad
safety.
that's
preservative
of
the
state's
powers.
then
the
preempting
provision.
until
the
secretary
covers
the
subject
matter.
this
statute
is
drawn
very
narrowly.
therefore,
it
must
be
construed
very
narrowly
and
especially
in
light
of
the
presumption
against
preemption
when
you've
got
such
traditional
state
police
powers.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
your
honor,
without
434...
the
preemption
might
have
even
been
broader
without
it,
but
it
preserves
state
laws
relating
to
railroad
safety
until
the
secretary
covered
the
subject
matter,
and
that--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is
fairly
common,
but
the
language
used...
the
language
congress
chose...
we
have
to
assume
they
knew
the
meaning
of
what
they
were
saying.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
your
honor,
i
classify
it
as
such
because
it
says
that
state
law
is
preserved
relating
to
railroad
safety,
and
then
when
it
says
what's
preempted,
what
does
it
say?
the
secretary
has
to
cover
the
subject
matter,
not...
the
secretary
didn't
say,
well,
when
the
secretary
passes
a
regulation
that
relates
to
railroad
safety.
the
congress
said
cover
the
subject
matter.
that's
why
i
say
the
statute
is
narrowly
drawn.
it's
also
supported
by
the
legislative
history,
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
in
a
railroad
congressional
hearing
addressing
federal
and
state
roles
under
the
frsa...
this
is
what
congress
said.
the
states
may
adopt
or
continue
in
force
any
law,
rule,
regulation,
et
cetera,
until
the
secretary
has
promulgated
a
specific
rule.
this
prevents
the
mere
enactment
of
a
broad
authorizing
federal
statute
from
preempting
the
field.
then
to
ensure
even
more
that
state
law
wouldn't
be
arbitrarily
displaced,
they
included
the
local
safety
hazard
exception,
which
says
states
may
adopt
rules,
regulations
that
the
secretary
has
already
covered
when
there's
a
local
safety
hazard
and
it's
not
incompatible
with
the
federal
rule
and
it's
not
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
reading
this
and
then
reading
it
as
this
court
always
does
in
light
of
its
stated
purpose,
the
purpose
of
the
frsa,
not
as
csx
would
have
you
believe,
is
not
uniformity.
congress
described
the
purpose
as
this
act
to
promote
safety
in
all
areas
of
railroad
operations
and
reduce
accidents
and
deaths
and
injuries
caused
by
railroad
related
accidents
and
to
reduce
damage
caused
by
any
accidents
involving
any
carrier
of
hazardous
materials.
and
that's
very
important
when
we
talk
about
speed.
the
secretary
has
not
covered
the
two
subject
matters
at
issue
here
under
the
express
terms
of
section
434
read
in
light
of
its
stated
purpose.
with
regard
to
speed,
first
of
all,
section
213
does
not
regulate
what
the
state's
common
law
regulates.
it
does
not
cover
it.
it
may
relate
to
speed,
but
it
doesn't
completely
cover
the
subject
matter.
the
scope
of
the
act...
the
beginning
of
it
says--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
yes,
your
honor.
only
the
congressional
history
says
completely,
but
it
doesn't
say
relating
to
either,
and
it
doesn't
say
addressing.
and
congress
could
have
chosen
those
words.
congress
said
cover.
and
that
does
not
cover
the
subject
matter.
the
beginning
of
section
213,
your
honor,
says
this
is
all
about
track
safety
standards,
and
it
says,
well,
we're
going
to
govern
the
geometry.
we're
going
to
govern
the
roadbed.
we're
going
to
govern
the
number
and
the
quality
of
crossties
along
a
section
of
track.
then
congress
comes
up
and
says
now,
based
on
these
factors,
how
many
crossties
you
have,
based
on
how
much...
how
many
joints
and
rails
and
all
this
kind
of
stuff,
they
say
we're
going
to
classify
this
section
of
track
right
here
at
cartersville,
georgia
as
class
4.
a
class
4
track
you
can
travel
across
based
on
track
structure,
geometry,
and
all
that...
you
can
travel
across
it
at
60.
now,
if
the
railroad
wants
to
upgrade
it
to
a
class
6,
they
can
travel
at
110.
now,
then
you
can
see
that
they
were
addressing
one
thing.
you
can
read
it
from
the
text
of
that
act.
they
were
governing
how
fast
a
train
can
travel
and
not
derail,
and
that's
all--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--absolutely.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
yes,
your
honor.
according
to
section--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
national
maps
show.
i
will
tell
you
that
if
this
court
finds
that
speed
is
preempted
under
this
section,
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
considered
in
traveling
110
is
whether
you're
sitting
on
a
class
6
track,
and
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
grade
crossing
safety,
weather,
fog,
schools
in
the
nearby
area,
high
volumes
of
traffic
going
across
the
area,
nothing
that
the
common
law
controls.
you
can
see
also--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
your
honor,
and
in
most
cases
they
do.
ours
is...
our
case
is
common
law.
there's
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
that
did
deal
with
municipal
ordinances,
and
those
cases
held
that
it
was
preempted,
but
not
preempted
for
the
reasons--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--the
local
speed
ordinances
because
they
said
they--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--in
the
lower
courts.
that's
what
the
lower
courts
were
saying,
but
they
were--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
ordinance
is
not
preempted.
it
does
not...
this
section
213
does
not
cover
the
subject
matter
of
that
requirement
because
that
requirement
would
be
based
on
the
same
factors
as
the
state's
common
law,
the
traffic--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
understand
the
concern
that
you're
getting
at.
but
the
purpose
of
the
frsa
is
not
to
burden
interstate
commerce...
to
place...
take
a
burden
away.
the
purpose
is
to
promote
safety.
wouldn't
it
be
counterproductive
to
allow
the
railroads
to
travel
at
110
miles
an
hour
through
cartersville,
georgia
at
a
crossing
with
150
feet
of
sight
distance,
that
they
have
these
trucks
going
over
all
the
time?
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
he
sure
could.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
he
certainly
could.
i'm
not--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--no,
sir,
he
has
not,
and
i'm
not
certain
how
long
he'd
be
secretary
if
he
did
because
the
headlines,
if
they
said...
can
you
imagine
saying
congress
says
we
can
travel
110
miles
an
hour
across...
through
grade
crossings
on
all
railroad
tracks
in
the
united
states.
how
likely
would
it
be
that
it
would
have
been
passed?
then,
also
to
support
that
this
regulation
only
covers
derailments
and
track
classification
is
senate
report
91-6--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--that
would
be
great,
your
honor,
but
65
percent
of
the
crossings
out
there
have
no
active
protection
at
all.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
it's
both
very
important,
your
honor.
as
far
as--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
sir.
[laughter]
i
know
what
you
mean.
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
was
kind
of
upset
because
she
didn't
get
to
get
her
free
bag
of
coffee
by
getting
to
the
grocery
store
at
a
certain
time,
and
so
she
was
very
aggravated
by
this.
but,
your
honor--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
it
is.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
it
is
a
safety
factor.
however,
the
secretary
noted
in
the
reports
to
congress
that
it's
also
a
safety
factor
to
have
these
trains
slow
down
because
of
the
common
sense
involved.
the
slower
the
train
is
going,
the
more
time
that
the
motorist
has
to
perceive
the
train's
presence
and
to
react
to
it,
like
at
this
crossing
with
only
150
feet
of
sight
distance.
at
35
miles
an
hour,
it
was
upon
mr.
easterwood
in
3.2
seconds.
imagine
if
you
doubled
that
to
60
miles
an
hour.
your
honor,
as
far
as
if
a
gate
arm
always
were
in
place
at
every
crossing
in
georgia,
and
we
had
unlimited
federal
funds
and
could
just
put
them
everywhere,
and
they
always
worked
properly,
they
didn't
ever
malfunction,
and
they
didn't
ever
give
false
warnings,
and
they
didn't
ever
do
any
of
those
things,
you're
right.
speed
would
not
be
an
issue,
but
that's
not
the
reality
of
it,
sir.
the
reality
of
it
is
that
there's
not
gate
arms
at
every
crossing.
in
fact,
most
of
them
there's
not.
many
of
the
crossings
are
not
even
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
because
they're
not
public
crossings
to
begin
with.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
your
honor,
if
the
crossing
has
been
improved--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--we
look
at
those,
the
gate
arm
regulations,
strictly
as
funding
regulations.
that's
all
they
are.
every
one
of
them--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--no
preemption,
sir.
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
they
would
have
an
excellent
defense
if
they
did
what
was
required
by
646.214
in
state
law...
in
state
court.
and
what
jury
is
going
to
hold
them
liable
for
doing
no
more
than
they
were
allowed
to
do?
that's
the
way
our
system
works.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
your
honor,
i
believe
in
the
jury
system.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
i
believe
in
the
jury
system
completely,
and
i
do
believe
that
more
times
than
not
they
do
the
right
thing.
and
they
know
that
when
you
put
gate
arms
up
and
the
state
says
that's
enough,
they
have
enough
sense
to
know
that
you
don't
hold
them
liable
just
because
you
got
a
poor,
little
old
lady
over
here
that
doesn't
have
a
husband
anymore.
they
have
sympathy,
but
not
that
much.
i
know
because
i'm
in
front
of
juries
all
the
time.
now,
these
are
funding
regulations,
and
funding
regulations,
your
honor,
do
not
displace
state
tort
law
unless
they
do
so
with
such
explicitness
that
the
states
know
by
accepting
federal
funds
how
much
of
their
law
was
going
to
be
displaced.
that's
not
the
case
here.
every
regulation
cited
applies
to
federal
fund
projects.
the
prioritization
is
to
receive
federal
funds;
even
the
secretary
states
her
position...
or
his
position
as
overseer
to
ensure
that
federal
money
is
appropriately
spent.
the
regulations
that
were
promulgated
by
the
secretary
did
just
that,
ensure
that
federal
money
is
appropriately
spent
and,
of
course,
the
federal
government
wants
to
do
that.
and
why
do
they
give
it
to
the
states?
you
all
were
asking
that
question
earlier.
why
do
they
give
it
to
the
states
and
doesn't
that
preempt?
no.
they
don't
have
a
mechanism
for
giving
it
directly
to
the
railroad.
it
has
to
go
through
the
states.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
no,
sir,
not
the
private
crossings
at
all.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
just
the
public
crossings.
that
would
be
possible--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--well,
maybe
they
do.
maybe
they
do
take
the
rinky-dink
ones,
and
they
don't
worry
about
those,
the
ones
that
are
out
in
the
country.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
well,
they're
supposed
to
look
at
them
all.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
they're
supposed
to
look
at
them
all.
i
don't
know
how
in
practice
it
actually
works.
but
think
about
that,
your
honor.
think
about
if
you
accept
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
is
that
once
that
federal
money
is
spent,
you're
preempted.
then
every
time
that
diagnostic
team
walks
down
a
section
of
track,
down
any
area
in,
say,
10
miles
and
they
see
three
or
four
crossings,
just
because
they
walked
down
there
and
their
salaries
were
paid
with
federal
funds,
you're
preempted
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
which
would...
that
can't
be.
it
can't
be.
take
the
situation
here
where
a
motion
detector
was--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--your
honor,
mr.
trienens
was
correct
up
to
a
point,
that
they
did
decide...
they
did
put
it...
well,
let
me
say
this.
they
put
a
motion
detector
years
ago,
and
the
reason
why
they
put
the
motion
detector
is
they
were
upgrading
four
crossings.
when
they
upgraded
those
four
crossings,
they
decided
to
put
gate
arms
at
all
of
them,
and
that
included
cook
street.
they
wanted
to
do
that.
but
they
started
at
west
avenue.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
i
wish
i
could.
there
were,
but
they
were
used
to
improve
the
west
avenue
crossing
because
the
motion
detector
at
cook
street
wouldn't
work
with
the
new
circuitry
at
west
avenue.
so,
yes,
federal
funds
were
spent
to
put
a
motion
detector
at
cook
street
some
years
ago,
but
it
wasn't
for
the
safety
of
cook
street.
it
was
to
make
the
west
avenue
circuitry
work
because
you
have
to
change
it
all.
it's
all
tied
in
together.
so--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
sir.
that's
why
it's
such
a
complicated
answer.
now,
as
far
as
the
gate
arms
and
the
city
saying
no,
you're
not
going
to
do
that,
i
want
to
tell
you
what
happened.
what
happened
was
is
it
is
big,
and
they
said
you
can't
put
an
island
here
because
we
have
lots
of
tractor-trailer
traffic.
and
it
is.
it's
an
industrial
area,
and
you
know
how
wide
they
have
to
turn
when
making
a
turn.
if
they
put
an
island
in
the
middle
of
it,
they
couldn't
have
negotiated
that
turn.
so,
they
said
you
got
to
put
extended
gate
arms
on,
the
longer
ones.
and
the
railroad
said,
well,
then
we
got
to
raise
our
communication
lines
because
they're
going
to
interfere.
and
they
said,
okay,
we'll
do
it,
and
everybody
went
on
their
merry
way.
and
nobody
ever
did
anything.
the
railroad
never
reported
back
that
they
had
completed
raising
their
communication
lines.
then
mr.
easterwood
is
killed,
and
they're
saying,
boom,
you're
preempted
because
you
wouldn't
let
us
do
it.
it's
not
the
case.
that's
definitely
not
the
case.
and
that
shows
that
if
you
find
that
these
are
anything
other
than
funding
regulations
how
difficult
the
question
is
going
to
be
in
the
lower
courts
as
to
when
preemption
starts,
when
it
ends,
what
it
turns
on,
the
lapse.
is
there
a
lapse?
is
that
a
problem?
it's
just
common
sense
that
these
are
nothing
but
funding
regulations
that
do
not
supplant
state
tort
law.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
yes,
sir,
they
are.
the
states
are
given
a
certain
amount
of
funds,
and
part
of
it's
used
for
the
surveying
process,
some
to
pay
the
diagnostic
team.
and
so
there
you
go.
the
diagnostic
team
walks
down
the
track.
boom,
you're
preempted
under
that
analysis.
the
secretary
in
the
reports
to
congress
noted
that
because
the
railroad
does
have
tort
liability
in
cases
such
as...
in
railroad
crossing
accidents,
this
continues,
a
just...
a
continuing
interest...
excuse
me.
this
justifies
a
continuing
interest
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
in
the
total
safety
effort.
if
they
were
to
be
preempted,
your
honors,
from
placing
gate
arms
at
a
hazardous
crossing,
it
would
remove
all
incentive
to
improve
safety,
and
that
would
be
in
direct
opposition
to
the
purpose
of
the
federal
railroad
safety
act.
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
you
had
a
question.
okay.
neither
in
this
case
is
there
implied
preemption,
and
i...
correct
me
if
i'm
pronouncing
this
wrong,
but
in
cipollone,
it...
you
all
agreed
that
if
you
have
an
express
preemption
provision,
this
causes
you
to
not
have
to
look
at
whether
it
occupies
the
field
because
just
by
there
being
a
provision,
it's
assumed
that
congress
did
not
want
to
go
any
further
than
what
was
stated
in
the
provision.
so
far
as
conflict
preemption,
there
is
no
conflict
here
either,
your
honors.
csx,
first
of
all,
can
easily
comply
with
both
of
the
state
requirements
at
issue
here.
first
of
all,
the
solicitor
general
and
the
railroad
makes
the
argument
that...
its
counter
on
the
speed
argument
is
because
emergency
braking
will
place
them
in
a
position
where
that
would
cause
a
derailment,
and
they
all
concede
that
this
was
aimed
at
derailments.
section
213
was
aimed
at
derailments.
emergency
braking
is
not
the
question
here.
if
you
slow
down
to
what's
reasonable,
you
shouldn't
ever
have
to
emergency
brake.
and
a
point
that
came
out
earlier
during
mr.
trienens'
argument
was
very
interesting,
the
fact
that
the
proper
lookout
claim
still
remains
in
this
case.
the
proper
lookout
claim
couldn't
possibly
remain
if
the
speed
is
preempted
because--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
your
honor.
that
kind
of
makes
the
state
requirement
superfluous.
you
know,
well,
there
he
goes.
[laughter]
and
that
would
not
make
sense.
i'm
sorry.
the
secretary...
well,
let
me
state
then
also
it
is
supported
in
the
legislative
history
that
these
were
just
for
derailments,
and
that's
all
they
were
for
is
for
derailments.
in
senate
report
91-619,
the
senate
members
were
talking
about
recent
catastrophes
that
had
happened
from
derailments,
and
they
cited
one
case,
one
example,
where
a
car
derailed.
and
it
was
carrying
hazardous
chemicals,
and
it
caused
an
explosion.
the
explosion
destroyed
the
city's
major
industry.
it
destroyed
several
homes,
and
it
contaminated
the
water
supply
for
several
months.
then
they
found
out
that
a
$50
track
repair
would
have
made...
caused
that
derailment
not
to
occur,
that
that
would
have
happened.
if...
congress,
the
senate
members,
noted
that
because
of
that,
they
thought
that
the
derailments
were
caused
by
poor
track
conditions
combined
with
highe
average
speeds.
mr.
parker
pointed
out
to
me
this
morning
in
the
usa
today,
the
bottom,
left-hand
corner,
an
article
says
69
percent
of
train
accidents
are
derailments.
the
secretary
in
section
213
was
only
regulating
congress'
perceived
cause
of
these
terrible
derailments
that
happen
so
frequently,
poor
track
conditions
combined
with
higher
average
speeds.
thank
you.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
well,
your
honor,
under
their
interpretation,
they
say
that
they
don't.
in
fact,
in
their
reply
brief...
it
amazed
me...
they
said
we
still
have
the
duty
to
slow
down
to
avoid
a
collision.
what's
the
difference
between
slowing
down
to
avoid
a
collision,
a
specific
collision--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
yes,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--right,
but--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--that
is
all
they're
saying,
but
what
we're
doing
with
the
railroad
is
no
more
than
we're
doing
with
a
truck
driver
on
i-75.
if
he
comes
to
an
area
where
the
lanes
narrow
down
into
one
because
they're
doing
construction,
we
require
him
to
slow
down,
to
not
kill
somebody.
we
don't
pat
him
on
the
back
and
say
that's
okay.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
it
is,
and
now
they're
saying
in
their
reply
brief
that
they
have
the
duty
to
slow
down.
and
that's
what's
inconceivable
to
me,
your
honor,
is
i
don't
see
what
the
difference
is
in
slowing
down
to
avoid
a
specific
collision
and
slowing
down
to
avoid
a
collision
because
you're
in
a
dangerous
area.
but
they--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--right.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
or--
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
that's
right.
ms.
tambra
p.
colston
and
if
they
knew...
by
that
same
reasoning,
if
they
knew
that
there
was
a
little
path
there
because
it
was
a
national
park
and
pedestrians,
people,
frequently
and
bicyclers
frequently
went
over
the
tracks
there
to
go
into
the
other
part
of
the
national
park,
would
they
then
not
have
a
duty
to
know
that
that
hazard
is
up
there
and
that
it's
very
likely
that
an
accident
could
occur
because
the
conditions
are
so
bad
and
not
slow
down.
it's
inconceivable,
your
honor,
that
the
secretary
would
pass
a
regulation
like
that
in
the
name
of
safety.
thank
you.
