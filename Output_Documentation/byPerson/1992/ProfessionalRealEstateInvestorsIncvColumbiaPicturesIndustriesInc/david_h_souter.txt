justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
pin
you
down
a
little
bit
on
your
concept
of
motivation?
you've
spoken
of
not
genuinely
motivated,
ulterior
motivation,
and
indifference
to
result.
if
you
go
on
just
a...
an
ulterior
motivation
theory,
every
case,
as
i
think
you
suggested
a
moment
ago,
is
going
to
end
up
as
a
mixed
motive
case.
isn't
your
strongest
argument
that
the
mental
state
must
be
one
of
indifference
to
success,
which
is
rather
a
different
thing
from
simply
saying
ulterior
motive
or
mixed
motive?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
but-for
test
is
different
from
your
indifference
to
result
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
articulating
it
now
and
it's
different
from
the
standard
of
indifference
to
result,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
one
thing
is
clear,
isn't
it,
that
we'll
never
have
summary
judgment
in
one
of
these
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
be
pretty
careless.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
based
on
success
below?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
because
columbia
wasn't
a
litigation
case.
