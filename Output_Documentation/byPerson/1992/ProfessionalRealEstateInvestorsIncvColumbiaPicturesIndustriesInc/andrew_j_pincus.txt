mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
important
at
the
outset,
we
believe,
to
focus
on
the
precise
nature
of
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case.
in
determining
the
contours
of
the
noerr
doctrine,
you're
interpreting
the
sherman
act
because
noerr
and
its
progeny
make
clear
that
that
doctrine
rests
squarely
on
a
construction
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it
mentions...
actually
in
a
footnote,
it
states
that
the
court
isn't
reaching
the
first
amendment
question--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--because
it's
resting
its
decision
on
statutory
interpretation
grounds.
in...
and
in
construing
this
particular
statute,
the
court
has
broader
latitude
than
it
does
in
the
typical
statutory
interpretation
case
because
when
congress
enacted
the
sherman
act,
it
gave
the
courts
broad
responsibility
for
giving
content
to
the
statute's
broad
mandate
by
formulating
rules
of
liability.
so,
we
think
the
appropriate
methodology
here
is
clear.
the
court
should
weigh
the
costs
and
the
benefits
of
the
contending
rules
and
select
the
one
that
best
reconciles
the
general
goals
of
the
sherman
act
with
the
particular
purposes
of
noerr
immunity,
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
just
that
and
that
its
rule
is
the
appropriate
one.
now,
mr.
coyne
has
said
something
about
the
benefits
of
petitioners'
approach
in
terms
of
the
supposed
enhancement
of
antitrust
enforcement,
and
it
certainly
is
possible
to
hypothesize
examples
of
conduct
that
would
be
captured
by
petitioners'
rule,
but
would
be
exempt
from
antitrust
liability
under
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
we
think
that
justice
stevens'
remark
about
probability
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
in
considering
what
weight
to
give
to
these
hypothetical
possibilities,
it's
important
to
recognize
just
how
unlikely
the
conduct
that
petitioners
have
hypothesized
is
in
the
real
world.
what
is
required
is
a
lawsuit
that
petitioners
could
win
but
have
no
interest
in
winning.
certainly
the
overwhelming
majority
of
lawsuits
that
a
plaintiff
can
win
are
prosecuted
at
least
in
part
to
achieve
that
goal.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
understand
it's
not
their
test,
justice
scalia,
but
in
city
of
columbia,
the
court
framed
the
inquiry
as
a
lawsuit
that
was
not
genuinely
aimed
at
procuring
favorable
government
action
at
all,
and
noerr
was
certainly--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
but
it
was
a
case
about
what
the
sham
exception
means.
it's
not
clear
at
least
that
the
intent
should
vary
from
context
to
context.
the
question
that
the
court
was
getting
at
in
noerr
and
that
the
court
was
also
getting
at
in
california
motor
transport
was
an
intent
not
to
gain
a
benefit
through
victory
in
the
governmental
forum,
but
to
impose
costs
through
the
process
of
that
forum.
so,
the
question,
it
seems
to
us,
should
be
the
same,
and
noerr
and
city
of
columbia
made
clear
that
mixed
motive
cases
are
cases
that
are
protected.
noerr
itself
says
that
noerr
was
a
mixed
motive
case.
part
of
the
reason
that
the
railroads
undertook
the
conduct
was
to
harm
the
trucking
industry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
although
your...
i
mean,
your
interests
may
be
affected
in
just...
in
as
much
a
material
way.
it's
true
that
the
process
requires
you
to
respond,
but
in
the
legislative
context,
the
process
may
well
require
you
to
respond
or
you'll
face
the
law
being
enacted
that
will
harm
you
quite
substantially.
and
certainly
the
chilling
and
the
first
amendment
protected
interest
in
petitioning
we
think
are
very,
very
powerful,
and
i
think
that's
the
interest
that
has
to
be
weight
against
this
cost.
it's
the
interest
that
mr.
coyne
doesn't
mention,
but
what
noerr
was
designed
to
do
was
to
give
protection
to
the
very,
very
substantial
first
amendment
interests
that
underlie--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--petitioning
activity
generally
and
lawsuits
in
particular.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it
relied
on
the
interests,
the
petitioning
interests,
that
were
at
stake
there
and
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
it
was...
the
court
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
construing
the
sherman
act
the
way
it
did
was
to
avoid
potential
first
amendment
problems
and
also
on
the
assumption
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
come
close
to
burdening
those
interests,
at
least
without
some
more
particular
directive.
so,
the
court
didn't
rest
its
decision
on
the
first
amendment
per
se.
it's
a
statutory
construction
case,
but
the
court
rested
its
decision
on
the
first
amendment
interests
that
are
at
play
in
this
area.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
did,
and
in
california
motor
transport,
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--several
years
later,
though,
in
california
motor
transport,
the
court
squarely
held
that
the
very
same
interests
warrant
that
extending
noerr
to
the
judicial
petitioning
to
the
litigation
area,
and
the
decision
in
bill
johnson's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
you
did.
the
court
said--
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
our
standard...
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
standard...
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
objective
indicia,
that
intent...
subjective
intent
is
not
the
only
inquiry
here,
and
that
what
has
to
be
shown
in
order
to
inquire
into
subjective
intent
is...
what
has
to
be
satisfied
is
an
objective
standard.
baselessness
is
one
way
to
satisfy
that
standard.
in
california
motor
transport,
the
court
listed
a
variety
of
other
conduct
that
would
suffice,
misrepresentations,
bribery
of
judges
or
jurors,
something--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
think
it's
a
two-part
test,
that
there
is
an
objective
element
and
a
subjective
element,
that
we
don't
say
intent...
and
we
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
intent...
is
irrelevant.
we
think
that
one
gets
to
the
question
of
intent
after
showing...
after
overcoming
an
objective
threshold
that
provides
the
safeguard
and
prevents
the
chill
on
the
first
amendment
protected
conduct
or
conduct
imbued
with
the
first
amendment
interest.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
exactly,
your
honor.
you
don't
get
into
discovery.
you
don't
get
into
the
problems
of
privilege,
and
you
don't
get
into
the
problems
of
having
every
single
case
have
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
purpose
of
the
objective
threshold
is
to
eliminate
the
chill
that
would
result
from
a
wholly
subjective
standard.
it's
what
the
court
has
done
in
the
official
immunity
area
in
the
harlow
case.
it's
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
in
the
predatory
pricing
context.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that
would
be
insufficient,
yes.
we're
not
advocating
a
discovery
rule.
it's
a
substantive
rule
of
liability.
its
purpose
is
to...
is
just
as
the
rule
that
truth
is
a
defense
to
libel
cases,
just
as
the
court
has
required
objective
standards
in
a
variety
of
areas
where
the
danger
of
a
wholly
subjective
standard
would
be
to
chill
indisputably
protected
conduct.
that
is
the
very
reason
why
here
we
think
there
has
to
be
an
objective
test
so
that
people
who
have
legitimate
claims
and
legitimate
intent
can
be
sure
ex
ante
that
they
will
not
be
burden
with
an
antitrust
claim
that
will
automatically
have
discovery,
that
will
be
submitted
to
a
jury
on
an
incredibly
complicated
and
uncertain
intent
standard,
and
lead
to
very,
very
uncertain
liability
decisions.
if
someone
is
faced
with
that,
if
someone
goes
to
their
lawyer
and
considering
that
whether
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
says,
well,
i'm
thinking
about
filing
this
lawsuit,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
risks
are,
in
petitioners'
world,
the
lawyer
would
have
to
say,
well,
one
risk
is
that
you're
going
to
be
met
with
an
antitrust
counterclaim.
and
let
me
tell
you
what
will
happen
if
an
antitrust
counterclaim
is
filed.
first
of
all,
the
standard
is
extremely
murky.
it's
a
but-for
intent
test
now,
which
i'm
not
sure
how
it
would
play
out
in
the
real
world,
but
i
think
any
document
that
referred
at
all
to
the
burden
that
was
going
to
be
imposed
on
the
other
side
as
a
result
of
the
litigation
process,
whether
in
passing
or
not,
would
certainly
i
think
be
sufficient
to
get
to
the
jury
in
petitioners'
world.
and
so,
the
person--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
that
kind
of
intent,
of
course,
is
not
the
kind
of
intent
that
noerr
was
referring
to.
the
kind
of
intent
that
noerr
requires,
that
kind
of
intent
is
wholly
legitimate
in
the
copyright
context.
if
what
you're
intending
to
do
is
enforce
a
legitimate
copyright
interest,
that's
precisely
the
right
kind
of
intent
that
you're
supposed
to
have.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
that's
entirely
legitimate
because
the
way
you're
going...
if
the
way
you're
going
to
put
him
out
of
business
is
by
getting
an
injunction
by
prevailing
in
a
copyright
proceeding,
that's
entirely
legitimate.
what
noerr
requires,
the
separate
kind
of
intent,
is
the
intent
only
to
put
him
out
of
business
because
of
the
burdens
you're
going
to
inflict
on
him
in
the
litigation.
and
that's
the
question.
and
i
think
the
court
has--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
although
i
think
in
the
copyright
context,
you
could
premise
it
just
on
a
single
copyright
because,
as
justice
white
says,
that's
a
monopoly
in
itself.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
mean,
here
there
are
efficiencies.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
there
are
tremendous
efficiencies
for
copyright
holders
to
use
antipiracy
committees
to
enforce
their
rights
because
the
burden
on
one
copyright
holder
to
do
that
would
be
tremendous,
and
so
if
the
law
permits--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
exactly
the
problem
with
petitioners'
standard
is
that
in
every
single
case--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
except
the
only
way
we
can
enforce
our
copyright
rights
are
in
court.
these...
they're
not
rights
that
are
enforceable
through
self-help,
and
that's
why
the
courts
have
recognized
the
special
need
to
allow
a
forum
for
legitimate
copyright
claims.
and
under
petitioners'
standard,
where
subjective
intent
is
the
only
question,
a
person
with
a
legitimate...
stipulated
to
have
legitimate
motivation
and
a
winning
claim
wouldn't
know
what
was
going
to
happen
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it's
the
intent...
well,
as
the
court
put
it
in
city
of
columbia,
it's
the
intent
to
disrupt
the
defendants
in
the
initial
lawsuit,
the
defendants'
business
relationships,
solely
through
the
litigation
process
without
any
regard
to
prevailing--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
only
through
the
burdens
of
the
litigation
process
and
not
through
the
ultimate
judgment.
that's
the
distinction
that
the
court
drew
in
noerr
and
that
has
followed
through
ever
since.
burdens
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
problem
with...
as
exactly
as--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
i
don't
think
it's
the
problem
with
our
test,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
problem...
the
court
recognized
in
noerr
that
where
there's
a
mixed
motivation,
where
the
intention
is
to
burden
the
other
side
through
the
governmental
process,
through
the
outcome
of
the
governmental
process,
as
well
as
through
the
process
itself,
that
mixed
motivation
case
is
a
case
that's
protected
under
noerr.
that
is
what
the
court
squarely
held
in
noerr
because
it
was
clear
in
that
case
that
the
intention
of
the
lobbying
was
both
to
win
a
victory
in
the
legislature
and
also
through
the
publicity
campaign
to
directly
injure
the
business
of
the
opposition.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
exactly,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that...
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
we're
weighing
the
costs
and
the
benefits
of
the
contending
standards,
as
i
was
saying,
the
cost
in
terms
of
antitrust...
lessening
of
antitrust
enforcement
in
requiring
an
objective
test
is
quite
low
because,
as
mr.
coyne
said,
virtually
every
case
is
going
to
be
a
mixed
motive
case.
so,
there
are
very
few
cases
out
there...
at
least
every
case
of
a
objectively
reasonable
lawsuit
is
going
to
be
a
mixed
motive
case.
there
just
aren't
that
many
case
out
there
of
objectively
reasonable
lawsuits,
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--exactly.
certainly
instituting
lawsuits
are
not
cost-free.
so...
and
that's
in
fact
what
the
evidence
bears.
there
isn't
a
case
that
the
other
side
has
been
able
to
point
to
that
would
come
out
differently
under
the
court
of
appeals
standard.
there
just
aren't
any
of
these
animals
out
there
that
we're
trying--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
the
government's
test
is
still
entirely
an
ultimate
subjective
standard.
the
government
has
some
presumptions
thrown
in
that
would,
they
say,
guide
the
jury,
but
the
only
question
in...
if
the
jury
interrogatory
is
is
there
noerr
immunity,
the
only
question
is
subjective
intent.
there's
no
question
whatever
about
objective
intent...
of
objective
indicia
for
the
court
to
make.
in
our
world,
there
are
two
steps.
first,
the
court
makes
an
objective
determination
of
whether...
in
this
case
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
support
the
lawsuit.
if
the
court
finds
probable
cause,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
if
the
court
finds
no,
the
suit
was
baseless,
then
there's
an
inquiry
into
subjective
intent.
and
if
the
requisite
subjective
intent
is
found,
the
intent
only
to
inflict
harm
through
the
process,
as
opposed
to
the
result,
then
noerr
immunity
doesn't
apply
and
the
litigation
can
be
the
basis
for
antitrust
liability.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
clear.
i
think
repetitive
lawsuits
might
well
be
another
kind
of
objective
indicia.
i
think
in
defining
what
conduct
satisfied
the...
satisfies
the
objective
standard,
what
we're
searching
for
is
a
class
of
objective
acts
that
are
inconsistent
with
legitimate
petitioning
activity
because
what
we
want
to
do
is
give
people
who
are
engaging
in
legitimate
petitioning
activity
some
certainty
that
they'll
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
lawsuit
early
without
being
subject
to
a
murky
intent
standard
and
discovery.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
rule
11
does
have
language
prohibiting
lawsuits
with
an
improper
purpose.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
the
courts...
the
lower...
it's
interesting
that
the
lower
courts
have
interpreted
that
to
permit
proof
of
purpose
only
through
objective
misconduct.
a
number
of
courts...
and
i
can
cite
to
the
court
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
the
townsend
case,
which
is
reported
at
929
f.
2d
at
1138.
this
issue
didn't
come
up
in
the
briefing...
is
a
case
where
the
court
said
in
order
to
prevent
chill,
we're
going
to
only...
we're
not
going
to
allow
inquiry
into
the
minds
of
the
other
side.
we're
going
to
look
to
the
objective
facts,
and
if
through
those
objective
facts
improper
purpose
can
be
demonstrated,
then
we'll
impose
liability.
but
they
adopt
the
very
kind
of
objective
standard
that
we're
urging
in
this
case
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
found
in
this
case,
to
prevent
this
murky
intent
inquiry
that
will
chill
legitimate
conduct.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
you...
this
court
has
not
addressed
it,
but
i
think
the
court's
decision
in
the
harlow
case
is
very
instructive
because
that
was
a
situation
in
which
the
court
had,
for
official
immunity,
adopted
a
standard
that
required...
in
order
for
immunity
to
apply,
both
an
objective
and
a
subjective
test
had
to
be
satisfied.
subjective
good
faith
was
required.
and
the
court
in
harlow
reformulated
the
standard
precisely
because
the
subjective
inquiry
was
too
burdensome
and
was
chilling
legitimate
conduct,
and
we
think
that's
exactly
why
it's
the
right
way
to
go
here
because
there
will
be
the
same
kind
of
chill
on
legitimate
activity.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
the
conduct
that's
being
protected
by
an
objective
standard.
the
conduct
that's
being
projected
is
the
legitimate
conduct
that
is
being
chilled
by
the
fear
of
liability.
maybe
i
should
turn
to
the
chilling.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
it
avoids
significant
burdens
on
the
people
with
legitimate
motives
and
legitimate
claims.
and
that's
exactly
what
noerr
was
designed
to
do,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
a
host
in
a
first
amendment
areas...
for
example,
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
the
court
required
falsity.
in
other
cases,
the
court
has
required
falsity
and
required...
precisely
because
it
wanted
to
protect
truthful,
legitimate
conduct.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what's
going
on
here.
but
i
think
you're
right,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
to
retreat
from
mixed
motive
would
be
a
very
dramatic
change
in
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
this
area
because
noerr
squarely
holds
that
mixed
motives
are
protected.
and
i
agree
with
you.
once
you
say
that,
that
the
antitrust
enforcement
benefits
of
petitioners'
rule
are
negligible
because
those
animals
just
don't
exist.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
there
were
other
acts
that
were
alleged,
but
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
petitioners
had
not
shown
antitrust
injury
as
to
those,
and
they
didn't
seek
certiorari
as
to
that
determination.
so,
those
are
out
of
the
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
what
this
one
is,
although
i
should
say
even
in
the
cases
where
there's
other
conduct,
i
think
there's
a
danger
in
inferring
bad
intent...
what
noerr
makes
bad
intent
from
anticompetitive...
alleged
anticompetitive
activity
because
the
anticompetitive
intent
that
supports
the
other
allegations
could
be
perfectly
valid
intent
if
the
lawsuit...
in
the
prosecution
of
a
lawsuit.
if
you're
engaging
in
misconduct
because
you
want
to
eliminate
a
competitor
and
you
filed
a
lawsuit
because
if
you
win
in
the
lawsuit,
you're
going
to
eliminate
the
competitor,
those
other
acts
don't
necessarily
mean
that
the
lawsuit
is
being
undertaken
with
bad
intent.
so,
i
think
there's
a
danger
in
mixing
those
two
situations
here.
but
i
agree
with
you.
in
the
present
case,
it's
hard
to
see
the
problem.
but
let
me
turn
to
what
i
think
should
be
balanced
against
the...
what
i
think
is
a
very,
very
negligible
benefit
of
antitrust
enforcement,
and
that
is
most
significantly
the
very,
very
heavy
burden
that
would
be
imposed
on
the
fundamental
right
to
petition
government
for
redress
of
grievances.
a
party
with
legitimate
motives
for
filing
suit,
the
type
of
person
noerr
seeks
to
protect,
would
be
chilled
from
engaging
in
that
conduct
for
a
number
of
reasons.
as
i
said,
if
that
prospective
plaintiff
goes
to
a
lawyer
and
asks
what's
going
to
happen
if
i
file
this
claim,
the
lawyer
will
have
to
say,
well,
first
of
all,
you
may
be
met
with
an
antitrust
counterclaim.
and
if
you
are,
under
petitioners'
standard,
the
only
question
is
going
to
be
subjective
intent,
and
the
jury
is
going
to
have
to
adjudicate
that
9
times
out
of
10
because
it
will
be
very
hard
to
prevent
discovery.
and
the
jury's...
the
outcome
that
the
jury
will
reach
will
be
very,
very
uncertain
indeed.
professor
areeda
has
described
the
inquiry
as
a
hazardous
one
because
intent
is
often
a
jumble
of
mixed
impulses
even
if
we
succeed
in
identifying
the
particular
human
being
whose
intention
is
relevant,
and
that's
especially
true
in
the
corporate
context
here
where
there
are
many,
many
decision
makers
and
lots
of
documents
to
go
through.
it's
going
to
be
very,
very
difficult
to
predict
how
that
determination
is
going
to
come
out.
and
moreover,
the
chilling
effect
is
amplified
here
because
of
the
penalties
that
lie
at
the
end
of
the
road,
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees.
and
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
the
court
has
several
times
said
that
super-compensatory
liability
produces
a
heightened
chilling
effect
on
legitimate
conduct.
and
finally,
petitioners'
standard
will
require
discovery
in
every
case,
and
as
was
discussed
earlier,
sensitive
questions
are
going
to
arise
about
the
disclosure
of
privileged
information
either
because
the
antitrust
plaintiff
is
going
to
seek
it
or
because
the
antitrust
defendant
is
going
to
be
put
to
the
choice
of
maintaining
his
privilege
and
possibly
being
unable
or
being
disabled
from
defending
against
the
sham
claim
or
reviewing
the
privileged
information
in
order
to
show
the
legitimate
basis
for
the
lawsuit.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
certainly,
your
honor.
the
government
acknowledges
that
even
unsuccessful
claims
should
be
protected,
but
the
standard
that
it
proposes
is
one
that
is
still
an
ultimate
intent
standard.
and
what
it
basically
says
is
that
in
deciding
what
the
actual
subjective
intent
of
the
antitrust
defendant
is,
weight
should
be
given
to
objective
factors,
which
i
don't
think
is
a
very
surprising
conclusion.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
government
would
have
intent
be
the
only
question.
so,
we
differ--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
they
haven't
proposed
any
special
discovery
rule.
they've
said
that
the
district
courts
have
the
power
under
their
current
authority
to
limit
discovery.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
they
think,
for
example,
in
this
case
the
pleading
was
not
sufficient
to
entitle
petitioners
to
discovery.
but
i
think
the
way
it
works
out
for
the
government
is
that
there
are
presumptions
that
guide
the
fact
finder
in
determining
intent
and
that
those
presumptions
may
also
in
some
cases
prevent
discovery
where
all
the
objective
evidence
is
on
the
antisham
side
of
the
ledger,
that
it
may
be
very
difficult
for
an
antitrust
plaintiff
to
obtain
discovery.
but
they
rely
on
the
regular
apparatus
for
controlling
discovery,
and
we
think
that's
a
very,
very
uncertain
protection
for
people
who
are
ex
ante
deciding
whether
or
not
to
engage
in
this
protected
conduct
and
weighing
the
potential
burdens.
you
just
can't
know
what's
going
to
happen
down
the
line,
whether
the
district
judge
is
going
to
cut
off
discovery
or
not
cut
off
discovery.
it's
extremely
uncertain.
and
we
think
that
really
does
not
provide
the
sufficient
protection
as
the
court
concluded
in
harlow
and,
as
i
should
say,
the
common
law
has
made
clear
because
the
common
law
analogs,
if
you
will,
to
this
question
both
require
objective
indicia
before
there
can
be
inquiry
into
subjective
intent.
both
malicious
prosecution
and
abuse
of
process
require
an
objective
showing
for
precisely
this
reason,
in
order
to
prevent
chilling
of
misconduct.
let
me
just
conclude
in
answering
the
question
about
the
government's
position
that
we
think
their...
the
problem
is,
as
i
say,
their
entirely
subjective
inquiry
doesn't
provide
the
protection
that
a
dual
objective-subjective
inquiry
does.
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
rule
that
they've
adopted.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
you
will
in
the
cases
where
the
objective
standard
isn't
met,
but
we
think
that's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
it's
interesting.
we
did
a
survey
of
the
cases,
and
petitioners
haven't
taken
issue
with
it,
that
if
one
looks
at
the
cases
in
which
a
sham
has
been
found,
even
in
circuits
that
have
an
entirely
subjective
test,
there
is
invariably
objective
misconduct
accompanying
it.
so,
we
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
standard
is
going
to
cut
off
or
give
some
immunity
to
misconduct
that's
occurring.
i
think
that's
a
red
herring
in
this
case.
let
me
conclude.
let
me
just
mention
one
other
thing
about
the
government's
approach
because
petitioners
have
argued
that
they
like
the
government's
subjective
test,
but
they're
entitled
to
discovery.
and
if
that's
true,
i
think
that
reveals
a
considerable
flaw
in
the
government's
standard
because
if
in
this
case,
where
there
are
no
objective
indicia
of
anything
but
a
properly
prosecuted
lawsuit...
if
in
this
case
they're
entitled
to
discovery,
then
the
government's
protection
is
not
going
to
be
much
protection
because
in
every
case
they're
going
to
be
entitled
to
discovery.
the
jury
is
going
to
make
this
very,
very
murky
intent
determination,
and
we're
going
to
have
very,
very
substantial
chilling
of
legitimate...
the
filing
of
legitimate
lawsuits.
and
that's
exactly
what
noerr
was
designed
to
prevent.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
coyne,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
