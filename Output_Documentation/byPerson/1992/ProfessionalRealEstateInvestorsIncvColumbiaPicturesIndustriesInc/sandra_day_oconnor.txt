you--
--you
take
the
view
that
if
there
were
a
properly
conducted,
successful
lawsuit,
but
with...
conducted
with
improper
motives,
that
that
is
covered
by
the
sherman
act.
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
then
isn't
what
i
said
correct?
mr.
coyne,
the
solicitor
general
supports
your
argument
in
part
at
least
on
the
theory
of
the
sham
exception,
but
then
goes
on
and
suggests
that
in
any
event
there
should
be
an
affirmance
here
on
the
summary
judgment.
justice
sandra

was
the
argument
made
below
for
your
clients
basically
that
the
suit
was
really
baseless?
was
that
the
focus
of
it
all?

mr.
pincus,
does
rule
11
proscribe
lawsuits
that
are
properly
conducted,
but
brought
solely
to
impose
litigation
costs
on
the
other
side?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
we
haven't
handed
down
anything
on
that
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
other
hand,
there
isn't
a
whole
lot
of
social
utility
in
allowing
lawsuits
for
the
sole
purpose
of
causing
business
injury.
