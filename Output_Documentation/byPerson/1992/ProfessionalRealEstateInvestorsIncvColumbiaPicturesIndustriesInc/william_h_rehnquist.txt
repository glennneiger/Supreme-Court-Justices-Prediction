we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-1043,
the
professional
real
estate
investors
v.
columbia
pictures
industries.
mr.
coyne.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precise
intent
would
you
say
was
sufficient
here,
mr.
coyne?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
think...
what
about
a
mixed
motive
case
where
you're
rummaging
through
a
corporation's
files?
you
come
across
one
thing
that
says
maybe
this
and
another
thing
that
says
maybe
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
difference--
--have
we
held
that
the
first
amendment
protects
the
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
have
we
held
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
seldom
get
a
summary
judgment
in
a
case
like
this
if
you
can
go
through
a
corporation's
files
on
a
question
of
intent.
the
ninth
circuit
centers,
at
least
much
more
easily
administrable
i
think,
than
the
one
you're
urging.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
still
isn't
going
to
do
a
whit
for
you
on
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
true
without
the
presumption.
if
after
discovery
no
evidence
of
intent
turns
up,
he
doesn't
need
the
presumption
to
grant
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
but-for
test,
would
it
be
a
strictly
factual
test?
would
these...
this
particular
client
and
these
particular
attorneys
have
brought
the
case,
or
is
there
an
element
of
reasonableness?
would
a
reasonable
attorney
have
brought
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
actual
factual
intent
of
these
particular
litigants
that
would
be
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
all
to
be
digested
and
found
on
by
a
jury
i
take
it
in
a
disputed
fact
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coyne.
mr.
pincus,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
noerr
doesn't
even
mention
the
first
amendment,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
noerr,
as
you
say,
just
relegates
the
first
amendment
to
a
footnote.
it
did
not
rely
on
the
first
amendment
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
you
don't
reach
that
threshold,
you
don't
inquire
into
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
also,
but
before
you
get
to
intent
under
your
standard,
you
have
to
cross
an
objective
threshold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coyne.
the
case
is
submitted.
