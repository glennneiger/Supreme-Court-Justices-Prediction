justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
two
questions
to
be
sure
i
have
your
test
right?
supposing
a
lawyer
writes
his
client
a
letter
assessing
the
desirability
of
filing
a
lawsuit,
and
he
comes
out,
after
talking
about
the
costs
and
the
probability
of
success,
saying
it's
really
about
a
50-50
choice
and
i'll
leave
it
up
to
you
to
make
the
judgment
as
you're
the
client.
and
the
client
writes
back
and
says,
well,
50-50,
i'm
willing
to
go
ahead
with
it
because
it
will
impose
some
costs
on
my
competitor
and
that
makes
the
difference
for
me.
that...
that's
the
illegal
lawsuit
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
second
question
i
have,
would
it
not
normally
be
true
that
the
facts
that
enable
one
to
decide
whether
the...
your
test
is
met
would
be
privileged
communications?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule?
do
you
understand
that
this
baseless
test
that
it
applies
applies
only
when
there's
just
one
piece
of
litigation,
or
would
they
apply
the
same
test
if
they...
if
you
had
15
similar
lawsuits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
it...
that
doesn't
strike
me
as...
i
mean,
normally
you'd
think
in
the
sham
litigation
that
at
least
i'm
most
familiar
with
you
have
repetitive
filings,
and
some
may
have
some
merit
and
some
don't
have
any
merit.
but
the
probability
of
having
sham
litigation
with
one
lawsuit
that
was
sufficiently
meritorious
to
pass
the
baseless
test
seems
to
me
fairly
remote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that's
standard
in
trademark
and
copyright
litigation,
isn't
it,
to
put
everybody
on
notice
that
you're
going
to
defend
your
monopoly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
you
assume
they
thought
it
was
until
after
it
had
been
litigated,
then
it
would
be
normal
behavior,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
for
our
purposes
we're
assuming
it
is
not
a
baseless
lawsuit.
i
think
that's
the
predicate
on
which
we
take
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i
can
understand
your
argument.
if
you're
willing
to
peak
at
legislative
history,
you'd
probably
find
out
it
was
baseless,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
we
have
to
assume
it
was
not
baseless,
i
mean,
for
our
testing
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
pincus,
isn't
there
a
little
difference?
and
maybe
i
don't
have
the
case
in
mind.
isn't
this
a
case
in
which
there
are
several
large
companies
that
are
in
the
business
of
distributing
motion
pictures
all
allegedly
got
together
to
accomplish
this
policy
objective?
it's
not
the
simple
case
of
a
normal
single
owner
of
one
copyright
trying
to
enforce
that
copyright.
so,
the
problem
is
limited
to
the
case
in
which
there's
other
evidence
which
might
at
least
be
consistent
with
some
kind
of
an
antitrust
conspiracy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
certainly
not
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincus,
can
i
ask
you?
i
don't
know
whether...
maybe
you're
just
defending
the
ninth
circuit
rule.
is
there
a
difference
between
your
test
and
the
government's
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two...
one.
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
test
would
apply
to
repetitive
lawsuits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
normally,
is
this
the
only
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
alleged
conspiracy...
conspiracy
alleged
in
the
complaint,
the
pleadings,
bringing
the
baseless
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
would
seem
to
me
most
cases
in
the
real
world
of
antitrust
litigation...
usually
the
sham
litigation
charge
is
1
of
about
19
things
you
charge
the
defendants
with.
it's
kind
of
rare
to
say
the
only
antitrust
injury
that
the
victim
of
a
price
fixing
or
some
other
conspiracy
suffered
is
the
fact
he
had
to
defend
a
lawsuit.
it
seems
to
me
you
might
have
one
test
when
it
is
one
of
many,
many
things
that
are
charged
against.
then
you
might
say,
well,
this
could
increase
their
damages,
but
if
this
is
the
only
incident,
it's
kind
of
a
strange
antitrust
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
what
this
one
is,
isn't
it?
