justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
is
that...
one
way
or
another,
whether
the
case
is
baseless
or
not
or
whatever
the
outcome,
intent
is
the
sole
and
only
determiner.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
you
look
at
all
the
factors,
what
are
you
trying
to
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
that
intent
in
the
end
is
the
determining
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
if
they
don't
have
any
intent...
considering
all
the
factors,
if
there
was
no
intent
to
harm
competition,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
there
is
intent--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
there
is
intent
to
harm
competition,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
well
based
the
case
was
or
even
if
it
was
won.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
your
answer
is
there's
a
federal
law
against
litigation
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
the
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
claim
of
antitrust
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
always...
he
certainly
has
a...
apparently
has
a
right
to
protect
his
copyright.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
thinks
you're
violating
his
copyright,
he
can
sue
you.
but
you
say
that
if
he
really
wants
to
injure
you,
he
can't
protect
his
copyright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
copyright
owner
is
always
going
to
be
at
risk.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
your
standard
is
exactly
that
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
if
you've
got
a...
if
your
suit
isn't
baseless,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
the
end
do
you
think
intent
is
determinative?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
your
standard
ought
to
apply
in
a
copyright
case
if
you've
got
clear
unequivocal
proof
that
you
have
an
intent
to
monopolize.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
want
to
put
the
fellow
you're
suing
out
of
business
because
he's...
he...
you
think
he's
using
your
copyright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
if
you're
going
to
sue
a
person
with
a
legitimate
claim
of
a
copyright
infringement,
you're
always
going
to
be
imposing
litigation
costs
on
him.
that's
in...
unless
you
say,
by
the
way,
to
avoid
a
sham
claim
around
here,
i'm
going
to
pay
your
legal
bills.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
just
like
that's
your
problem
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
in
a
copyright
case
again
what
would
be
the...
it
wouldn't
be
the
intent
to
monopolize
and
enforce
your
copyright
that
causes
the
plaintiff
any
trouble.
what
is
it
that's
going
to
cause
him
some
trouble
and
have
the
jury
decide
that
it's
a
sham?
what
is
it?
what
kind
of
intent
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
we're
talking
about
a
copyright,
and
he
certainly
is
intending
to
interfere
with
the
plaintiffs'...
with
the
defendants'
business.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
this
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
you're
going
to
succeed
in
the
case
and
get
a
judgment,
that
burden
on
the
defendant
is
always
going
to
be
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
problem
with
your
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
with
the
level
of
legal
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
word
or
two,
can
you
tell
me
what
the
government's
position
is
and
how
it
differs
from
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
--subjective
inquiry
in
very
many
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think...
you
think
there
are
really
very
few...
going
to
be
very
few
baseless
cases.
