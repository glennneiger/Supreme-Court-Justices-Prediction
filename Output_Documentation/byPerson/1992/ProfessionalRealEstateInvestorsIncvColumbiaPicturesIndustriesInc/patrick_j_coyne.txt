mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
use
of
the
litigation
process
as
an
anticompetitive
weapon,
as
opposed
to
use
of
the
outcome
of
that
process,
violates
the
antitrust
laws.
the
question
today
is
whether
in
drawing
the
line
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
uses
of
the
judicial
process
a
court
can
refuse
to
consider
highly
relevant
evidence
of
intent
under
the
ninth
circuit's
baselessness
standard.
even
a
memorandum
in
a
party's
files
admitting
that
the
only
reason
a
case
was
brought
was
to
drive
a
competitor
out
of
the
market
through
the
cost
of
the
litigation
process,
regardless
of
the
outcome,
would
not
be
admissable
or
even
discoverable.
i
would
like
to
establish
today
three
points.
first,
predatory
litigation,
that
is,
a
suit
that
is
brought
to
burden,
to
harass,
to
intimidate,
to
impose
costs
upon
a
competitor
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
judicial
process,
violates
the
antitrust
laws.
second,
the
ninth
circuit's
baselessness
test
strips
these
important
antitrust
concerns
of
any
realistic
level
of
protection.
a
case
can
be
more
than
baseless,
yet
still
use
the
judicial
process
improperly
to
harm
competition.
the
ninth
circuit
standard
would
immunize
these
predatory
cases
in
spite
of
the
antitrust
injury
they
cause
and
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
any
genuine
intent
to
petition
the
courts
for
redress
of
grievances
under
the
first
amendment.
third,
an
inquiry
into
subjective
intent
is
workable.
it
also
does
not
chill
the
exercise
of
genuine
first
amendment
rights.
even
rule
11
allows
an
inquiry
into
subjective
intent
of
the
litigant.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
chief
justice,
it's
the
intent
to
use
the
process
itself
to
harm
competition
as
distinct
from
the
intent
to
achieve
a
judicial
outcome
as
an
anticompetitive
tool.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
virtually
every
case
is
going
to
be
a
case
of
mixed
motive.
if
we
begin
in
a
summary
judgment
setting
such
as
this
with
the
premise
that
there
is
an
anticompetitive
intent,
as
we
have
to
in
this
case,
then
the
predator
is
going
to
accept
the
kill.
they
will
not
turn
it
away.
so,
there's
going
to
always
be
a
willingness
to
accept
a
positive
judicial
result.
what
the
trier
of
fact
has
to
do
is
consider
all
of
the
evidence
of
intent
and
reach
a
finding
on
whether
it
was
motivated
by
an
attempt
to
abuse
the
process
as
opposed
to
achieve
the
outcome.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
no,
justice
white.
we
don't
believe
that
intent
is
the
sole
determinant.
there
are
a
number
of
factors
this
court
has
looked
at
over
the
years.
in
allied
tube
it
identified
the
context,
the
source,
the
nature
of
the
petition.
in
california
motor
transport,
it
looked
directly
at
the
intent
with
which
it's
brought.
it
also
looked
at
the
use
of
misrepresentations,
unethical
means
before
the
court.
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
direct
the
lower
courts
to
look
at
all
five
factors,
but
on
the
element
of
intent,
the
issue
is
intent
as
to
the
means
versus
intent
as
to
the
outcome.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
you're
trying
to
decide
whether
the
litigant,
the
plaintiff,
in
the
underlying
lawsuit
genuinely
intended
to
be
exercising
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
in
the
way
this
case
is
presented
to
the
courts...
court,
absolutely,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
if
there
were
no
intent
to
harm
competition
at
all?
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
certainly,
but
that's
not
this
case,
and
we
have
not
yet--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--gotten
discovery
to
examine--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--assuming
that
fact--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--yes,
there
would
be
no
basis
to
inject
a
sham
argument.
but
here
the
district
court
did
not
allow
any
discovery
into
the
issue
of
intent.
it
was
presented
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
sham,
and
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
finding
on
that...
in
that
setting,
that
there
is
an
overall
anticompetitive
intent,
an
intent
to
harm
competition.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
yes,
justice
o'connor,
we
do.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
it--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--if
you
are
indifferent
to
the
outcome,
no.
what
the
first
amendment
protects
in
terms
of
the
right
to
petition
is
just
that,
petitioning
the
government
for
redress
of
a
grievance.
if
this
case
was
brought
for
some
ulterior
motive,
it
is
not
a
genuine
petition
and
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
to
vindicate.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
the
first
amendment
protects
a
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
i
believe
that
not
in
those
terms,
but
this
court
has
in
vendo
and
in
bill
johnson's
restaurants
held
that
a
much
higher
standard,
almost
equivalent
to
a
prior
restraint
standard,
is
necessary
in
the
setting
of
trying
to
enjoin
pending
litigation.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
i
believe
that
that...
my
reading
of
the
case
is
that
it
is,
yes.
that
standard,
however,
that
would
apply
in
a
prior
restraint
does
not
necessarily
convert
to
the
standard
that
would
apply
to
imposing
liability
after
the
fact,
as
this
court
held
in
vendo
and
in
bill
johnson's.
the
third
principle
that
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
with
today
is
that
an
inquiry
into
subjective
intent
is
workable.
the
antitrust
considerations
that
inform
the
sherman
act
doctrine,
the
sherman
act
principles,
are
concerns
about
markets,
concerns
about
consumers,
concerns
about
economic
freedom.
those
special
antitrust
concerns
go
far
beyond
the
concerns
that
inform
rule
11,
namely
concerns
about
judicial
efficiency
and
fairness
to
litigants.
those
antitrust
concerns
compel
a
full
inquiry
into
intent.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
it...
chief
justice,
it
is
a
bright
line.
it
is
admittedly
easy
to
apply.
it
is
also
the
wrong
line.
what
it
does
is
invades
the
province
of
competition
policy
unnecessarily
in
the
guise
of
protecting
first
amendment
speech
or
first
amendment
right
to
petition.
in
reality
if
that
petition
was
not
genuinely
motivated,
it
isn't
really
a
first
amendment
petition,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
invade
competition
policy
to
the
extent
that
the
respondents
would
have
the
court
do.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
yes,
it
is.
that
is
the
standard
that
we
urged
in
our
brief.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
on
reflecting
further
on
it,
what
may
be
a
more
workable
standard
for
the
court
is
to
examine
it
on
a
but-for
basis;
namely,
if
the
case
would
not
have
been
brought
but
for
the
predatory
motive
separating
out
the
legitimate
petitioning
motive
from
the
predatory
motive,
if
it
were
not
brought
but
for
the
predatory
motive,
that
case
would
never
have
been
brought
at
all
legitimately.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
depending
on
the--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--depending
on
the
development
of
the
record,
justice
scalia,
yes,
there
are
situations
where
the
court
would
be
well
within
its
province
to
dispose
of
the
case
if
there
were
presumptions
created,
for
example,
a
nonbaseless
case
that
was
successful
below.
it's
not
this
case,
but
if
we
had
such
a
case--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--no,
justice.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
not
every
case
would
go
to
that
stage.
if
the
facts,
as
i
just
outlined,
for
example,
a
nonbaseless,
successful
suit
below--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--unlike
the
one
here--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--and
there
were...
discovery
was
allowed
and
there
were
no
evidence...
there
was
no
evidence
developed
that
the
case
was
predatorily
motivated,
we
would
agree.
we
think
that
doctrinally
that
case
should
not...
that
presumption
should
not
be
rebuttal,
but
the
district
judge
would
be
within
his
province
to
grant
summary
judgment
in
that
setting.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
well,
i
would
imagine
very
rarely.
in
this
situation--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--stated
that
broadly,
petitioners
don't
agree.
what
the
evidence
that
we're
saying
is
germane
to
this
issue
is
the
evidence
with
which...
regarding
the
intent
behind
this
petition
was
it
brought
with
a
genuine
intent
to
achieve
the
outcome
that
is
being
offered
by
the
courts
or,
was
it
brought
for
some
predatory
motive
to
harass
or
intimidate.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
my
suggestion
is
that
the
standard
is
whether
the
intent
is
genuine.
in
applying
that
standard,
we
suggest
that
a
but-for
test
for
the
district
courts
is
the
most
workable.
the
district
court
would
consider
all
of
the
relevant
evidence
on
that
issue
of
intent.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
we
have
given
this
a
great
deal
of
thought
since
the
briefs
were
prepared.
we
don't
articulate
that
per
se
in
the
briefs,
but
we
believe--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--no,
i
don't
believe
it's
different,
justice
souter.
it's
simply
more
focused
and
i
believe
more
workable
in
terms
of
instructing
the
district
courts
how
to
handle
these
cases.
if
the
issue
is
indifference,
what
we
were
articulating
is
it's
indifference
between
your
pure
motive
and
your
evil
motive.
you
could
have
a
case
where
it
would
have
been
brought
on
the
strength
of
either.
that
could
pose
problems
under
the
first
amendment,
which
is
why
we
suggest
a
but-for
standard.
if
the
pure
motive
was
alone
sufficient
that
the
case
would
have
been
brought
on
the
strength
of
that
pure
motivation
alone,
then
it's
a
genuine
petition.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
not
necessarily.
i
can
imagine
a
number
of
situations
in
which
summary
judgment
could
be
granted
in
these
cases.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
not
necessarily.
if
the...
the
court
could
craft
presumptions
based
upon
whether
the
case
is
baseless
or
not
based
upon
success
below.
if...
as
i
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
if
the
case
were
not--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--based
on
the
success
in
the
underlying
case.
if
the
case
were
not
baseless
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
had
prevailed,
which
they
didn't
here,
that
case
might
be
entitled
to
an
extremely
strong
presumption
that
it
was
genuinely
motivated.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
it
would,
chief
justice.
the
district
judge,
in
considering
that,
would
allow...
then
allow
discovery,
and
if
no
evidence
were
turned
up
to
contradict
that
presumption,
he
would
be
within
his
powers
at
that
point
to
grant
summary
judgment.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
that
is
true,
but
in
this
case,
no
discovery
was
allowed.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
we
believe
that
the
united
states
is
wrong
in
that
position.
we
fully
agree
that
they
are
correct
with
respect
to
the
substantive
standard.
they
offered
three
reasons
for
that
harmless
error
argument:
one,
that
there
was
no
proof
of
antitrust
injury
by
petitioners
in
the
case;
second,
that
our
theory
of
antitrust
injury
was
not
adequately
pled;
and
third,
to
paraphrase
the
brief,
that
we
did
not
show
the
materiality
of
the
discovery
we
were
seeking.
on
the
first
point,
injury,
there
was
no
summary
judgment
motion
in
this
case
directed
to
injury.
the
only
motion
filed
was
directed
to
whether
this
case
was
or
was
not
a
sham.
we
had
requested
discovery
on
the
issue
of
injury
and
were
not
given
it.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
we
had
argued
both
points
below,
that
the
suit
was
baseless.
when
the
district
judge
applied
a
baselessness
standard,
we
had
also
argued
to
him
that
that
standard
is
not
correct.
we
had
argued
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
proper
standard
should
be
to
look
at
the
genuine
intent
behind
the
petition
and
that
the
case
was
baseless.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
review
the
issue
of
baselessness
at
this
point.
we
have
asked
for
certiorari
only
on
the
issue
of
the
standard.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
justice
kennedy,
as
long
as
the
copyright
holder
or
the
patent
owner
is
operating
within
the
lawful
scope
of
that
statutory
monopoly,
that's
fine,
but
for
example,
in
this
case,
one
of
the
issues
we
had
raised
that
they
were
attempting
to
misuse
their
copyrights.
when
the
copyright
holder
is
trying
to
extend
their
rights
beyond
what
the
rights
congress
gave
them,
that
is
misuse
and
that's
not
protected.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
the
standard
that
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
is,
in
terms
of
the
test
that
would
be
applied,
a
but-for
test.
if
that
case
would
have
been
brought
on
the
strength
of
its
genuine
petitioning
motive
alone,
regardless
how
much
more
overwhelming
was
the
predatory
motive,
we
would
concede
that
that
case
was
immunized.
if,
however,
that
predatory
motive
that
you've
described
became
material
to
bringing
the
case
in
the
first
place,
that
case
would
not
have
been
brought.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
the...
what
this
court
did
under
noerr
and
under
pennington
is
to
immunize
it
as
long
as
that
motive
is
a
motive
to
achieve
the
predatory
result
through
the
outcome
as
distinct
from
the
process.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
i'm
sorry?
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
they
were
not,
but
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
issue
in
walker
process,
in
united
states
v.
singer,
in
the
hand
guards
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
admittedly
as
an
intellectual
property
lawyer
myself,
i
am
confused
by
the
principles
that
have
been
applied.
i
believe
that
the
antitrust
issues
and
the
immunity
issue
probably
was
not
raised
adequately
in
some
of
those
cases,
but
an
intellectual
property
case
should
be
treated
no
differently
than
any
other
type
of
case
under
this
doctrine.
the
question
is
whether
the
intent
to
petition
was
genuine.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
we
believe
that
it
should
be
a
subjective
test.
now,
both
objective
and
subjective
types
of
evidence
should
inform
the
trier
of
fact
on
that
question.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
yes,
chief
justice.
that's
what
we
would
urge.
now,
for
example,
in
the
grip-pak
case,
judge
posner
and
judge
easterbrook
in
premier
electrical
attempted
to
derive
objective
evidence
that
would
create
an
inference
as
to
what
the
intent
was
based
upon
the
reasonableness
of
bringing
the
case,
whether
it
was
justified
by
the
cost
it
would
take
to
proceed
with
the
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
if
there
were
genuine
issues
of
material
fact,
yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
yes.
under
our
but-for
test,
that
anticompetitive
motivation
would
have
been
material
to
the
decision
to
bring
the
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
not
necessarily.
as
was
in
the...
as
in
the
case
in
grip-pak
and
premier
electrical,
there
are...
there
is
objective
evidence
that
should
also
be
examined
to
attempt
to
derive
an
inference
as
to
what
the
intent
was.
with
respect
to
privileged
communications,
we
would
urge
that
there's
no
different
rule
here
than
there
is
under
any
other
type
of
case.
if
there
is
a
waiver,
if
there
is
a
crime
fraud
issue,
that
would
be
discoverable,
but
absent
some
reasons
that
would
justify
piercing
that
privilege,
the
plaintiff
would
be
forced
to
proceed
without
that
evidence
in
this
case
just
as
in
any
other
type
of
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
in
the--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--the...
we
would
agree,
though...
yes.
but
we
would
agree
that
the
allegation
alone--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--but
the--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--that's
not
necessarily
true,
justice
scalia.
for
example,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
burlington
northern
case
applied
what
appears
to
petitioners
to
be
a
very
sensible
approach
to
that
very
question,
to
look
at
the
evidence
without
access
to
the
privileged
communications.
if
you
can
show
that
you
have
a
probability
of
succeeding
on
that
sham
exception,
only
then
does
it
even
become
discoverable.
it's
not
necessarily
even
admissible
at
that
point.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
yes.
there
are
two
things
i'd
like
to
point
out,
though,
justice
scalia.
yes,
it
is
unlawful.
one,
we're
not
urging
that
the
court
adopt
a
different
standard.
we're
urging
that
the
court
continue
the
precedent
of
noerr,
pennington,
otter
tail,
california
motor
transport
to
look
at
subjective
intent.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
i'm
sorry.
perhaps
i
misspoke,
justice
scalia.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
standard
is
an
abuse
of
process
standard.
abuse
of
process
deals
with
certain
problems,
abuse
of
the
judiciary,
fairness
to
litigants.
the
concerns
in
the
antitrust
setting
go
far
beyond
the
concerns
that
inform
those
issues.
there
is
harm
to
competitors,
and
simply
slapping
the
litigants'
wrist
and
fining
them
400
dollars
is
not
going
to
redress
the
serious
antitrust
injury
that
can
result
from
predatory
litigation.
predatory
litigation
can
increase
rivals'
costs.
it
can
drive
rivals
out
of
the
market.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
there
are
federal
laws
against--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--justice
white,
yes,
that
is
precisely
the
law
that
we
urge
is
contrary
to
it.
it's
a
question
of
what
damage
is
inflicted.
if
it's
simply
an
abuse
of
the
process,
then
perhaps
the
remedies
for
abuse
of
process
would
be
sufficient
to
remedy
it.
where,
as
in
this
case,
we
allege
that
antitrust
injury
has
resulted,
those
remedies
will
not
be
sufficient,
and
the
higher
remedies
that
are
available
under
the
antitrust
laws
should
be
imposed.
predatory
litigation,
unlike
legislative
lobbying,
is
inherently
coercive.
the
party
that
is
the
victim
of
it
does
not
have
the
option
of
sitting
it
out
and
waiting
to
see
what
happens.
a
default
judgment
will
be
entered
against
them.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
it's
unclear
from
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
my
personal
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit's
precedent
on
it
is
they
may
be
willing
to
go
with
a
rule
that
one
case
is
not
enough.
some
circuits
have.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
it
depends
on
the
lawsuit,
justice
stevens.
for
example,
in
this
case,
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
although
we
were
the
only
lawsuit
that
we
were
aware
of,
that
these
respondents
had
threatened
a
large
number
of
other
persons
in
the
market.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
i'm
not
sure
that
the
analogy
is
a
perfect
one
in
this
setting
for
the
precise
reason
the
district
court
held
below,
that
this
was
not
a
proper
protection
of
the
monopoly.
this
was
well
beyond
copyright
monopoly
protection.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
well,
we're
getting
into
the
baselessness
issue.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
we
think
there
are
very
serious
reasons
why
the
district
court
should
have
realized
that
these
respondents
knew
they
did
not
have
the
rights
they
were
alleging.
they
admitted
in
another
case--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--yes.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
or
admissions
in
other
cases.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
for
purposes
of
this
inquiry,
yes.
we
are
not
contesting
that
issue.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
the
injury
that
we
allege
here
is,
as
the
ninth
circuit
recognized,
at
a
minimum
having
to
defend
the
case,
but
petitioner,
mr.
kenneth
irwin,
was
also
a
video
equipment
dealer
at
the
time
this
case
was
brought.
he
was
trying
to
sell
alternative
systems,
alternative
to
spectradyne,
which
is
the
exclusive
licensee
of
these
studio
respondents.
that
market
has
largely
been
delayed,
and
in
some
instances
like
petitioner,
people
have
been
driven
out
of
the
market.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--he
does.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
he
has
a
right
to
protect
his
copyright.
all
we're
asking
is
that
in
bringing
a
lawsuit
to
that
end,
that
that
be
the
real
reason
they're
bringing
it
and
not
for
a
predatory
purpose.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
not
necessarily.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
thank
you.
the
standard
that
the
respondents
articulate
is
far
too
broad.
this
court
has
not
previously
adopted.
it
is
the
respondents'
test
that
is
a
radical
departure
from
this
court's
holdings
in
california
motor
transport
and
omni
outdoor.
the
standard
that
petitioners
urge
the
court
to
adopt
would
not
chill
first
amendment
rights,
at
least
not
legitimate
first
amendment
rights.
the
court
looks
to
subjective
intent
in
a
variety
of
other
settings,
in
the
setting
of
rule
11.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
rule
requires
an
examination
of
intent.
chambers
v.
nasco,
which
the
court
decided
last
term--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
justice
scalia.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
no.
i'm
saying
the
antitrust
concerns
go
beyond
what
is
the
basis
of
rule
11.
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
rule--
mr.
patrick
j.
coyne
--yes,
there
is,
and
rule
11
would
not
be
applied
in
that
setting.
but
we
urge
that
the
issue
of
sham
litigation
should
be.
under
chambers
v.
nasco
last
term
the
court
sanctioned
applying
attorneys'
fees
based
on
subjective
intent.
in
the
abuse
of
process
setting,
as
judge
posner
pointed
out
in
grip-pak,
again
looking
at
subjective
intent
in
determining
whether
abuse
of
process
has
occurred.
in
the
patent
and
copyright
area,
in
walker
process,
again
looking
to
fraud,
the
intent
of
the
party.
there
is
ample
precedent
that
looking
at
subjective
intent
in
this
area
will
not
chill
legitimate
first
amendment
rights.
the
but-for
standard
that
petitioners
urge
is
workable.
it
provides
full
protection
for
the
full
extent
of
exercise
of
legitimate
first
amendment
rights.
however,
unlike
respondents'
test,
it
doesn't
go
any
broader
than
it
needs
to.
finally,
it
does
vindicate
competition
policy.
these
are
important
concerns
of
competition
policy
that
the
court
should
be
looking
at.
it
goes
far
beyond
the
standard
of
rule
11.
thank
you.
