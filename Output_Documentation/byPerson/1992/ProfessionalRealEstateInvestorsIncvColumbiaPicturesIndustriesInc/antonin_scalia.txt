the
courts
are
going
to
determine
this,
this
very,
very
delicate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--delicate
question
of
motivation?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
it
was
successful.
so,
we'd
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
after
awarding
damages,
whether
you
award
it
or
not,
you
should
then
ask
yourself
in
view
of
this
counterclaim
that
this
is
predatory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
this
suit
would
have
been
brought
but
for
the
fact
that
it
is
harming
a
competitor.
justice
antonin
scalia
successful,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
does
anybody
bring
suit
against
a
competitor
without
hoping
to
harm
the
competitor?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there
will
always
be
some
evidence.
i
mean,
once
there's
discovery,
there
will
be
something
to
say,
boy,
we're
really
going
to
get
him
in
this
suit.
it
will
be
terrific.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
changing
your
testimony.
you
had
a
but-for
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
be
crime
fraud,
i
mean,
if
you're
violating
the
sherman
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
any
statement
made
to
a
lawyer
that
shows
that
you're
bringing
this
suit
violating
the
but-for
case,
you've
been
guilty
of
a
criminal
violation
i
suppose,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there's
really
no
problem.
justice
stevens
doesn't
have
anything
to
worry
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
is
you'll
be
able
to
get
all
the
communications
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
coyne,
why
should
we
adopt
this
special
rule
for
the
sherman
act?
i
mean,
i
guess
that
not
just
with
respect
to
the
sherman
act,
but
with
respect
to
any
litigation,
it
is
wrong
and
perhaps
unlawful
to
bring
a
lawsuit
simply
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
someone
even
if
it's
a
successful
lawsuit,
even
if
it's
a
little
more
than
baseless.
isn't
that
unlawful
anyway
to
use
the
courts
as
a
means
of
harassment?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
contend
that
that's...
you
contend
that
that
standard
with
respect
to
abuse
of
process
in
the
antitrust
area
is
different
from
the
standard
everywhere
else.
i
mean,
if
the
rule
you
suggest
is
a
sensible
one,
why
don't
we
apply
it
to
all
litigation
and
say
that
you're
in
violation
of
rule
11
or
you're
in
violation
of
some
other
court
rule
whenever
your
real
motivation
is
not
the
recovery,
but
just
to
harm
the
defendant
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
their
current
test
anyway.
it
isn't
that
they
have
no
interest
in
winning.
they
have
some
interest
in
winning,
but
that
alone
wouldn't
have
been
enough
but
for
their
desire
to
harm
their
competitor
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
involved
legislative
attempts,
i
mean,
rather
than
judicial
attempts.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
you
know,
even
if
you
assume
that
it
referred
to
first
amendment
interests,
it's
a
lot
more
plausible
in
the
context
of
trying
to
cut
off
somebody
from
going
to
the
legislature
than
it
is
cutting
off
somebody
from
going
to
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
we
mention
the
first
amendment
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do,
if
we
agree
that
mixed
motive
is
a
safe
harbor,
we're
really
not
arguing
about
a
whole
lot,
are
we,
because
if
it
is
above
the
baseless
level,
there
will
almost
always
be
a
mixed
motive?
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
case
where
you
have
a
good
shot
at
getting
a
recovery
and
yet
you
didn't
care
at
all
about
it.
your
only
motive
was
to
get
the
guy.
so,
i
mean,
once
you
agree
that
mixed
motive
is
okay,
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
whether
you
say...
go
along
with
you
or
go
along
with
your
opponent
except
that
going
along
with
you
forecloses
the
issue
a
lot
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
rule
11
be
applied
to
a
victor
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
rule
11
be
applied
to
a
prevailing
party
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
arguing
for
a
rule
that
applies
even
to
the
prevailing
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
reason
it
is,
i
mean,
you're
dealing
with
a
totally
different
situation
when
you
say
that
even
if
you
totally
win,
you
can
be
liable
under
your
theory.
nobody
suggested
rule
11
would
be
applied
to
the
prevailing
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there
is
an
objective
component
to
rule
11.
that
isn't
there.
