is
that
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
first
amendment
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit
if
you're
indifferent
to
the
outcome?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
we
accepted
your
view
or
something
that
was
quite
proximate
to
it,
would
we
not
have
to
be
quite
careful
about
suits
involving
intellectual
property
which,
after
all,
are
monopolies
in
themselves?
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
it
works
to
say
that
a
monopoly
holder,
i.e.,
a
copyright
holder,
cannot
have
a
predatory
motive.
that's
exactly
what
a
copyright
is
for,
to
drive
other
people
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
not
quite
consistent
with
your
predatory
motive
test.
let's
assume
that
there's
some
forgiveness
for
the
suit
that's
in
the
marginal
area
that's
reasonably
grounded,
but
ultimately
proves
unsuccessful.
would
the
predatory
motive
there
be
improper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
go
back
to
my
original
question.
don't
all
copyright
owners
have
predatory
motives
that
are
legitimate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
weren't
copyright
suits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
were
not
copyright
suits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
true,
as
the
petitioners'
counsel
pointed
out,
you
might
tend
to
sit
on
the
sidelines
or
just
wait
it
out
if
it's
in
the
legislative
forum,
whereas
if
you're
being
sued,
you
have
no
choice
but
to
proceed.
i
think
that's
a
very
substantial
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
purpose
of
the
objective
threshold
is
in
order
ultimately
to
show
the
forbidden
intent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
if
there
were
unequivocal
evidence
of
subjective
intent
to
harass
and
to
take
predatory
action
only,
say,
by
letters
in
the
file
that
the
plaintiff
had
before
the
discovery
process
began...
he
somehow
had
them...
that
would
be
insufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
characterize
it
as
a
discovery
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
it
works
out?
