chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-1010,
puerto
rico
aqueduct
and
sewer
authority
v.
metcalf
&
eddy,
inc.--
mr.
taranto.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gather
from
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit
in
this
case,
mr.
taranto,
that
they
may
have
felt
differently
about
it
than
you
do.
isn't
there
some
expressions
in
that
opinion
that
it's
a
very
sketchy
record
that
they
have
to
go
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
complexity
of
the
issue
could
have
something
to
do
with
whether
it's
immediately
appealable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
distinction
you
have
just
drawn,
mr.
taranto,
lead
to
a
different
result
as
to
appealability
in
official
capacity
suits
against
individuals
as
opposed
to
suits
against
an
entity
like
this
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
taranto.
mr.
sipkins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
what
extent,
mr.
sipkins,
can
we
look
behind
the
language
of
the
amendment
which,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
speaks
in
terms
of
suits?
you
say
you
can
look
back
to
earlier
drafts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
not
infer
that
there
was
some
change
of
intent
between
the
earlier
drafts
and
the
language
that
was
finally
adopted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
draw
that
deduction
from
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it
really
would
make
sense
from
this
court's
point
of
view
to
give
the
eleventh
amendment
the
sort
of
overhaul
that
you're
proposing
in
a
case
where
we're
trying
to
decide
whether
there
is,
an
order
denying
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
collaterally
appealable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
wrong
with
the
guidelines
that
were
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
balancing
test
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
mr.
sipkins,
would
say
that
if
the
state
eo
nomine
so
to
speak
is
a
party
it
may,
it
might
be
entitled
to
qualified,
rather
to
immediate
appeal
if
its
eleventh
amendment
claim
is
turned
down,
but
an
entity
that
claims
to
be
like
the
state,
like
the
petitioner
here,
would
not
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
state
itself
is
a
party
it
seems
to
me
it
will
never
be
turned
down.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you're
really
giving
absolutely
nothing
away.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
not
limiting
your
balancing
just
to
where
the
state
is
a
party
as
such,
but
it
could
be
a
state
department
or
so,
that
might
have
the
right
to
immediately
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sipkins.
mr.
taranto,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
no.
91-1010,
puerto
rico
aqueduct
and
sewer
authority
versus
metcalf
&
eddy,
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
