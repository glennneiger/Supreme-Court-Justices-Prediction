mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
urges
two
basic
positions
upon
the
court
today
with
all
due
respect.
first
we
urge
that
this
court
find
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
fiscally
driven
jurisdictional
limitation
on
the
article
iii
powers
of
the
federal
courts,
and
that
amendment
is
not
motivated
by
any
true
concerns
for
sovereignty
or
sovereign
immunity.
as
such,
we
urge
that
this
court
find
that
interlocutory
appeals
from
denials
of
motions
that
are
based
on
that
amendment
should
not
lie.
secondly,
we
urge
another
position
on
the
court
today.
we
urge
that
this
court
should
take
this
opportunity
to
develop
a
balancing
test,
a
balancing
test
between
two
critically
important
and
sometimes
conflicting
principles
of
sovereignty
on
the
one
hand
and
the
final
judgment,
and
the
final
judgment
requirements
of
section
1291
on
the
other.
in
so
balancing
we
believe
that
any
notions
of
sovereignty
pale
in
the
context
of
the
eleventh
amendment
when
it
is
not
the
state
itself,
the
state
qua
state,
that
is
seeking
to
invoke
the
eleventh
amendment,
but
rather,
where
as
here,
it
is
a
sewer
corporation
that
has
been
chartered
by
an
entity
that
is,
has
not
been
determined
to
be
a
state
for
the
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment
by
this
very
court.
generally
speaking
and
at
a
minimum
as
a
matter
of
law
we
urge
that
this
court
determine
that
where
sovereignty
cannot
be
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
interlocutory
appeals
do
not
lie
from
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
nevertheless
we
believe
that
for
purpose
of
the
balancing
test
a
determination
that
that
question
is
unanswered
neither
expands
nor
alters
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
and
the
court
of--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--in
part
correct,
among
others.
it
is
clear
that
the
eleventh
amendment
itself
is
not
based
on
anything
other
than
fiscal
concerns
and
that
it
is
certainly
not
based--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--well,
the
purpose,
we
believe,
of
the
eleventh
amendment
was
to
make
clear
at
the
time
of
chisolm
v.
georgia,
justice
souter,
that
matters
that
were
pending
at
that
time
in
federal
courts
had
to
be
dismissed.
and
as
a
result
the
amendment,
itself
having
gone
through
a
number
of
iterations,
ultimately
utilized
the
terms
suits
and
actions
commenced
or
prosecuted,
and
as
a--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--correct,
your
honor,
it
does
clearly
say
suits.
nevertheless
the
language,
the
historical
language
of
the
amendment
itself
clearly
indicates
that
the
framers
of
that
amendment,
who
knew
how
to
express
themselves
and
what
they
wanted,
did
not
develop
a
clear
prohibition
as
they
did
in
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
with
respect
to
not
having
to
stand
trial.
for
example,
the
first
iteration
of
the
eleventh
amendment
as
enacted
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
day,
or
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
day
after
chisolm
v.
georgia
stated
that
no
judicial
power
shall
lie
to
make
a
state
a
defendant
in
the
federal
courts.
that
was
then
amended
shortly
thereafter
to
include
the
language
that
we
currently
have
that
the
jurisdictional
power,
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
to
suits
that
are
prosecuted
or
commenced.
and
so
what
i
am
suggesting,
justice
souter,
is
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
themselves,
understanding
the
implications
of
sovereignty
and
the
implications
that
they
had
at
the
time,
did
not
utilize
language
which
clearly
precluded
the
state
from
being
hailed
into
court.
in
addition
there
were
no
true
concerns
for
sovereignty
at
the
time
that
the
amendment,
that
the
article
iii
of
the
constitution
was
enacted
since
after
all
of
the
article
iii
headings
three
of
them
specifically
mention
states
themselves,
six
of
them
do
not
mention
the
states
but
nevertheless
do
not
expressly
exclude
states
from
federal
jurisdiction.
the
eleventh
amendment
arose
after
chisolm
v.
georgia
clearly
as
a
result
of
concern
for
the
colonies,
then
states,
that
they
were
fiscally
strapped
and
they
did
not
want
to
have
after
the
war
the
state
treasuries
invaded
by
the
federal
jurists.
this
was
not
a
situation
where
the
framers
of
the
amendment
stated
clearly
and
unequivocally
that
there
should
be
no
ability
of
the
federal
courts
to
bring
the
states
before
the
bar.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
you
can
look
back
to
earlier
drafts
to
determine
whether
the
framers
clearly
intended
to
preclude
suits
against
sovereigns,
and
that
it
was
clear
that
they
did
not
in
the
earlier
drafts
because
the
language
was
far
more
clear
in
the
earlier
drafts
with
respect
to
what
they
intended.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
precisely
so,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
in
making
that
change
the
framers
of
the
eleventh
amendment
intended
that
in
certain
circumstances
you
could
bring
the
states
before
the
bar
of
the
court,
you
simply
could
not
invade
the
fisk,
that
this
was
a
fiscally
motivated
amendment.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
because
in
those
instances...
well,
you
can't
from
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself.
but
if
you
look
at
the
amendment
in
the
context
of
the
article
iii
powers
of
the
constitution
and
if
you
look
at
the
amendment,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
speech
and
debate
clause
and
with
respect
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
where
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
to
preclude
any
jurisdiction
whatsoever
they
clearly
stated
so,
and
they
did
not
state
so
here
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
there
are
problems--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--it
is
indeed
an
obstacle,
and
i
clearly
admit
that,
justice
scalia.
what
we
believe
is,
and
what
we
suggest
today
is
that
this
court's
utilization
of
the
concept
of
sovereign
immunity
since
hans
v.
louisiana
in
1890
as
a
framework
or
a
basis
for
a
number
of
decisions
that
this
court
has
rendered
dealing
with
the
eleventh
amendment
was
not
necessary,
and
that
in
fact
the
concept
of
sovereign
immunity
gave
rise
to
a
series
of
decisions
that
perhaps
were
not
well
considered
by
this
court
over
time.
and
that,
the
reason
for
hans
v.
louisiana
and
the
need
to
have
state
sovereignty
as
the
basis
for
the
eleventh
amendment
was
because
at
the
time
of
hans
v.
louisiana
the
law
of
what
law,
the
rule
of
what
law
applied
to
matters
pending
in
federal
courts
was
swift
v.
tison.
and
the
states
and
this
court
were
concerned
that
states
would
have
their
liability
determined
not
under
the
substantive
law
of
that
own
jurisdiction,
but
rather
under
federal
law.
since
1938
in
erie
v.
tompkins
those
concerns
of
the
states
and
the
concerns
of
the
courts
expressed
in
hans
v.
louisiana
don't
exist,
and
none
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
edelman
through
pennhurst
to
atascadero
need
to
have
sovereignty
as
the
basis
for
that
determination.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
justice
scalia,
we
do
not
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
overrule--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--they
are
founded
upon
a
basis
that
was
not
necessary
for
the
determination.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
is
correct.
there
are
indeed
some
problems
with
the
current
reading
of
those
cases.
first
this
court
has
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
jurisdictional
bar.
nevertheless,
although
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself
is
clear
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
extend,
clearly
this
court
has
held
where
states
waive
their
sovereignty
they
can
in
a
sense
create
that
very
judicial
power,
a
ruling
or
a
holding
which
we
believe
is
inconsistent.
in
addition
this
amendment
affects
the
federal
courts
and
limits
the
judicial
power
of
the
federal
courts,
but
says
nothing
whatsoever
about
congress
which
can
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment
in
appropriate
circumstances.
another
problem
with
the
current
reading
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
that
states
but
not
political
subdivisions
of
states
such
as
counties
or
cities
or
other
local
governments
are
entitled
to
invoke
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
what
we're
suggesting,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
this
court
utilize
this
opportunity
to
develop
some
very
clear
guidelines
for
when
a
matter
of
this
nature
is
appealable,
and
that
we
believe
that
this
case
presents
such
a
forum
or
such
a
vehicle
for
the
court
to
utilize
to
do
that.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
one
of
the
problems
with
the
guidelines
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan
is
that...
first
of
all
there
are
no
problems,
and
we
think
that
if
you
apply
those
standards
as
enunciated
and
as
stated
in
coopers
&
lybrand
v.
livesay
several
years
later
that
it
is
easy
to
say
that
this
particular
case
does
not
meet
at
least
two
of
the
three
standards
of
cohen.
for
example,
in
order
to
determine
that
the
second
test
of
cohen
has
been
met
it
is
necessary
to
determine
that
this
matter
presents
an
issue
that
is
too
important
to
be
denied
interlocutory
review,
and
the
only
basis
upon
which
it
can
be
determined
that
this
matter
is
too
important
to
be
denied
interlocutory
review
is
if
this
court
determines
that
indeed
the
eleventh
amendment
is
based
upon
precepts
of
sovereignty.
because
if
it
is
not
sovereignty
but
jurisdictional
matters
themselves
which
give
rise
to
the
eleventh
amendment,
then
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
an
animal
that
is
too
important
to
be
denied
review.
in
addition
we
believe
that
if
it
is,
as
we
have
posited,
the
state
fisk
that
is
principally
involved
in
the
eleventh
amendment
protections,
then
certainly
the
state's
fisk,
that
is
the
right
to
force
the
state
to
pay
or
the
right
to
face
the
state
to
do
something,
will
be
protected
upon
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
after
trial.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
well,
as
i
stated,
justice
kennedy,
we
have
suggested
two
alternative
grounds
to
uphold
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit
below.
the
first
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
only
to
the
protection
of
the
state
fisk
and
therefore
the
question
of
sovereignty
is
clearly
raised.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
balancing
test
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
is
something
which
the
court
is
inclined
to
adopt,
it
need
not
even
reach
in
this
instance
the
question
of
sovereignty,
because
if
it
is
not
the
state
itself,
it
is
not
the
sovereign
itself
with
which
we
are
dealing,
then
all
of
the
grand
notions
and
implications
of
sovereignty
which
the
petitioner
has
attempted
to
thrust
upon
the
court
need
not
be
dealt
with
here.
the
reason
is
clear
that
as
the
court
looks
at
this
balancing
test
of
the
protection
of
sovereignty
on
the
one
hand
and
the
interests
of
preserving
limited
federal
jurisdiction
as
set
forth
in
congress
in
section
1291,
then
as
you
get
further
and
further
away
from
the
state
sovereign
itself
and
towards
some
entity
which
has
been
created
by
it,
a
creature
which
has
been
created
by
it,
you'd
need
not
reach
the
question
of
sovereignty
at
all.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
is
precisely
the
relief
which
the
petitioners
have
asked
for,
and
what
that
would
require
is
that--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--no.
in
fact
to
the
contrary,
and
contrary
to
the
statement
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
upon
a
question
i
believe
asked
by
justice,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
first
circuit
has
reiterated
its
position
here
that
this
entity
is
unlikely
to
be
held
as
a
state,
as
an
arm
of
the
state.
in
its
decision
denying
a
motion
for
a
stay
pending
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
the
first
circuit
said
that
one
of
the
bases
for
denying
that
request
for
a
stay
was
that
it
continued
to
harbor
substantial
doubts
that
this
entity,
that
this
sewer
company
was
indeed
an
arm
of
the
state.
so
the
first
circuit
didn't
act
on
this
issue
only
with
respect
to
the
case
cited--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--well,
it
did
differ,
as
counsel
for
petitioner
suggests,
from
at
the
time
i
believe
four
and
now
perhaps
up
to
as
many
as
eight.
but
i
suggest,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
white,
that
it
in
fact
upon
a
careful
reading
of
those
circuits
does
not
differ
from
them.
several
years
ago,
several
terms
ago
this
court
decided
the
case
of
mitchell
v.
forsyth,
a
qualified
immunity
case
involving
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
the
issues
there
on
qualified
immunity
had
to
do
with
both
the
attorney
general's
immunity
from
suit
with
respect
to
actions
that
he
took
as
a
prosecutor
and
also
with
respect
to
actions
that
the
attorney
general
took
in
investigatory
capacities.
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
if
the
ability
to
claim
qualified
immunity
could
not
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
but
it
was
necessary
to
take
factual
evidence
and
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
that
factual
evidence
how
the
attorney
general
was
acting,
that
qualified
immunity
did
not
lie.
following
mitchell
v.
forsyth
four
or
five
of
the
circuit
courts
that
have
determined
the
question
about
eleventh
amendment
have
held
that
only
where
immunity,
sovereign
immunity
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law,
where
it
is
the
state
itself
that
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law,
should
eleventh
amendment
immunity
lie,
and
that
the
protections
of
eleventh
amendment
should
not
lie
where
it
is
necessary
to
make
factual
determinations.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
correct.
then
of
course--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--well,
what
i'm
giving
away
is
that
where
it
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
is
the
state.
for
example,
where
in
alabama
v.
pugh
it's
the
alabama
department
of
corrections,
or
in
welch
where
it's
the
texas
department
of
corrections,
or
in
any
number
of
other
jurisdictions
where
it
is
clearly
a
department
of
the
state
through
which
the
state
has
acted,
that
is
the
state
qua
state
or
the
state
itself.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
it's
not
a
question
of
as
a
matter
of
law
here
because
the
petitioner
itself
has
raised
issues
of
fact
that
are
still
open
and
have
not
yet
been
decided.
for
example,
it
suggests,
justice
scalia,
that
one
of
the
reasons
upon
which
it
can
claim
that
it
is
an
arm
of
the
state
and
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
because
the
judgment
sought
by
the
respondent
is
so
large
that
it
will
be
forced
to
go
back
to
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
in
order
to
attempt
to
get
funds
to
satisfy
the
judgment.
that
is
a
factual
question
that
frankly
can't
be
determined
until
trial
itself
is
completed.
and
unless
that
fact
has
been
determined
clearly
a
factual
question
prasa
itself,
the
petitioner
itself
suggests
that
the
issue
is
not
a
closed
question.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
there
are
indeed
questions
of
fact,
but
there--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--no,
there
are
shadings
of
questions
of
fact.
clearly--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--clearly,
justice--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--if
the
issue
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
here
the
issue
can't
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
i
don't
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
the
question
ought
to
be
whether
there
are
facts
that
are
in
issue.
it
ought
to
be
whether
that
there
need
to
be
factual
determinations
made
that
can't
be
determined
or
can't
be
made
until
the
conclusion
of
trial.
let
me
point
by
way
of
example
to
two
recent
decisions
of
the
first
circuit
involving
the
ports
authority
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
in
one
of
the
cases,
the
h/v
manhattan
prince
case,
which
proceeded
to
trial,
the
first
circuit
reversed
the
holding
of
the
trial
court
and
found
indeed
that
in
that
instance
involving
pilots
and
the
licensing
of
pilots
for
the
harbors
of
san
juan,
that
the
ports
authority
was
acting
in
a
state
capacity
and
that
therefore
it
was
entitled
to
claim
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
that
was
after
trial
and
the
development
of
facts
during
trial
that
assisted
the
entity
in
proving,
so
to
speak,
that
it
was
entitled
to
eleventh
amendment
protection.
2
years
later,
in
august
of
this
year,
in
a
case
entitled
royal
caribbean
v.
the
ports
authority,
the
eleventh,
the
first
circuit
found
that
the
eleventh
amendment
did
not
apply
to
that
very
same,
very
same
puerto
rican
public
corporation.
and
so
the
question
is
factually
determinative
in
the
sense
that
you
need
to
determine
what
it
is
that
the
public
corporation
is
engaged
in
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
acting
as
an
arm
of
the
state.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
is
correct,
it
did.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
i
believe,
justice
white,
that--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--i
believe
that
on
its
face
this
court
can
determine
that
there
are
open
questions
of
fact
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
permit
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
first
circuit
with
respect
to
this
instrumentality.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
what
is
to
be
gained,
justice
souter,
is
that
we
will
not
know
whether
or
not
prasa
has
finally
exhausted
its
arguments
that
it
is
an
arm
of
the
state
until
we
are
able
to
determine
precisely
how
large
any
judgment
that
might
obtain
is.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
no,
you're
correct,
justice
scalia,
you
don't
do
it
where--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--you
don't
do
it
there,
and
you
don't
do
it
in
those
instances
where
the
constitution
itself
is
clear
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
not
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
that
there
is
no--
mr.
peter
w.
sipkins
--it
collapses
into
the
essence
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
whether
or
not
sovereign
immunity
is
the
basis
for
the
eleventh
amendment
on
the
issue
of
when
the
state
itself
is
the
defendant
or
when
the
state
or
a
state
department
or
agency
is
the
state
defendant,
but
not
so
where
it
is
something
that
is
so
far
extended
from
the
sovereign
itself.
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
stated
and
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
below.
