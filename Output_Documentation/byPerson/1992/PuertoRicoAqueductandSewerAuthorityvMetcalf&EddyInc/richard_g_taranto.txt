mr.
richard
g.
taranto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
an
order
denying
a
state
entity's
claim
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
immediately
appealable
as
a
collateral
order.
the
question
arises
in
this
case
because
of
the
well-established
law
that
puerto
rico,
though
not
itself
a
state,
is
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
under
the
same
standards
as
apply
directly
to
states
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
district
court
held
that
the
puerto
rico
aqueduct
and
sewer
authority
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state
and
denied
the
authority's
immunity
claim.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
this
court
has
not
spoken
to
that
question.
this
court
has
spoken
many
times
to
the
general
question
of
whether
puerto
rico
is
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
both
under
its
status
before
1952
and
since
1952.
the
court
has
said
that
the
commonwealth
status
has
only
increased
its
sovereign
status.
the
first
circuit
has
clearly
held
repeatedly
that
puerto
rico
is
to
be
treated
as
a
state
for
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
it
is
an
open
question
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that's
right,
it's
not.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
the
appealability
of
the
order
denying
the
claim
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
merits
of
the
eleventh
amendment
claim?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
and
puerto
rico
doesn't
claim
to
be
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
merely
to
be
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity
under
the
same
standards
that
states
have
under
the
eleventh
amendment
because
of
the
structure
that
congress
established
in
granting
it
semi-sovereign
status
in
the
commonwealth
act
in
1952.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
think
it
is
a
jurisdictional
matter.
this
court
has
said
in
fact
in
general
that
eleventh
amendment
questions
are
not
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
that
the
court
is
obliged
to
notice
them,
as
they
are
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
for
purposes
of
the
appeal--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
the
question
comes
to
this
court
on
the
assumption
that
the
merits
of
the
claim,
going
to
the
appealability
issue,
that
the
claim
is
meritorious,
and
the
only
question
then
is
whether
the
denial
of
that
assumedly
meritorious
claim
should
be
immediately
appealable.
the
first
circuit
held
that
the
denial
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
collateral
order,
and
its
only
rationale
was
that
the
eleventh
amendment
in
its
view
protects
only
a
state's
interest
in
avoiding
the
imposition
of
monetary
judgments
and
interests
that
can
be
vindicated
by
appeal
after
trial.
our
position
is
that
the
first
circuit
was
wrong
because
it
misunderstood
the
basic
character
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
rationale
is
squarely
contradicted
by
this
court's
repeated
holdings
that
apply
the
eleventh
amendment
to
bar
equitable
relief.
cases
as
far
back
as
ex
parte
ayers
and
more
recently
alabama
against
pugh
and
cory
against
white
directly
hold
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
as
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself
requires,
goes
beyond
protecting
against
monetary
relief.
more
broadly,
the
first
circuit's
holding
was
wrong.
my
central
point
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
where
it
applies,
must
be
viewed
as
protecting
a
state's
right
not
to
be
sued.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
in
alabama
against
pugh--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
department
of
corrections
was
also
a,
one
of
the
two
petitioners.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
state
was,
and
the
department
of
corrections,
and
this
court
i
think
summarily
ordered
the
dismissal
of
both
of
those
parties.
and
the
puerto
rico
aqueduct
and
sewer
authority
claims
to
be
an
arm
of
the
state
in
the
same
sense
as
any
department
of
the
state
would
be,
notwithstanding
its
somewhat
different
form
of
organization.
the
first
circuit's
contrary
view
rested
on
a
mistake
in
treating
a
doctrine
that
overrides
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine,
as
if
it
changed
the
nature
of
the
immunity
where
the
immunity
is
not
overridden.
and
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
where
finally
denied
by
the
district
court,
presents
an
appealable
collateral
order.
like
the
first
circuit,
i
am
focusing
on
the
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment
right,
because
all
of
the
other
elements
of
a
collateral
order
are
clearly
satisfied.
first,
an
order
like
the
one
here
is
a
final
rejection
of
the
claim
of
immunity.
there
wasn't
anything
tentative
about
the
district
court
decision,
and
nothing
later
in
the
litigation
could
be
expected
to
alter
it.
there
is
therefore
no
risk
that
appellate
review
now
either
will
be
advisory
or
will
have
to
be
repeated
later.
second,
the
issue
whether
the
authority
is
an
arm
of
the
state
is
completely
separate
from
and
collateral
to
the
merits
of
the
litigation,
whether
there
has
been
a
breach
of
contract
and
if
so
what
damages
may
have
resulted.
there
is
therefore
no
risk
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
be
less
than
fully
able
to
decide
the
immunity
issue
before
the
merits
have
been
resolved.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
think
so.
the
first
circuit
did
not,
as
i
recall,
comment
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
of
immunity,
and
the
district
court's
decision
turned
on
one
simple
fact,
the
potential
monetary
liability
of
the
commonwealth
for
any
judgment
in
this
case.
the
first
circuit
in
an
earlier
case
had
expressed
some
doubt
about
the
claim
of
prasa
to
sovereign
immunity,
but
that
i
think
cannot
be
overplayed
in
its
significance.
the
first
circuit
with
respect
to
the
tourism
company
in
puerto
rico
expressed
quite
similar
doubts,
only
2
years
later
upon
full
examination
of
the
issue
to
find
that
the
tourism
company
was
indeed
an
arm
of
the
state.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
less
than
complete
about
the
record
given
the
factors
that
go
into
the
arm
of
the
state
analysis.
this
court
in
i
think
its
two
most
extensive
analyses
of
that
issue,
the
lake
country
estates
case
and
the
mount
healthy
case,
noted
that
the
factors
essentially
turn
on
the
state's
legal
treatment
of
the
entity,
who
appoints
the
governing
board
of
the
entity,
whether
it
is
declared
to
be
performing
a
private
or
a
governmental
function,
whether
it
is
declared
to
be
an
instrumentality,
what
the
financial
relationship
is,
whether
there
is
tax
immunity.
these
are
matters
that
in
general
at
least
can
be
determined
from
looking
at
the
statutes
of
puerto
rico.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
nature
of
the
factors
that
go
into
the
immunity
claim
are
not
before...
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
denial
of
the
claim
that
prasa
is
an
arm
of
the
state
is
immediately
appealable
under
the
cohen
standards.
and
not
only
here
was
the
denial
final,
the
district
court
said
prasa
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state.
whether
it's
determined
to
have
breached
a
contract
or
imposed
any
damages
can't
change
that
judgment.
it
is
obviously
collateral
to
those
issues.
and
finally,
the
issue
is
obviously
both
not
a
matter
for
district
court
discretion,
after
all
prasa
either
is
or
is
not
an
arm
of
the
state,
and
it
is
also
important.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
issue
could
have
something
to
do
with
that.
i
think
complexity
is
no
more
a
problem
here
than
it
is
in
double
jeopardy
or
official
immunity
cases
where
some
significant
amount
of
legal
analysis
may
be
required
to
identify
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
at
the
time
of
the
defendant's
conduct,
or
even
in
the
speech
or
debate
context,
whether
a
particular
aide
is
serving
as
an
alter
ego
of
a
member
of
congress
or
whether
the
member
was
performing
a
legislative
versus
a
political
function.
these
are
issues
that,
while
they
may
have
several
factors
involved
in
them,
do
not
involve
any
district
court
discretion
and
so
can
be
decided
de
novo
by
a
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
this--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--that's
right.
there
is
a,
one
of
the
requirements
for
a
collateral
order
under
cohen
is
that
the
issue
be
separate
from
and
collateral
to
the
claim
on
the
merits.
the
question
whether
a
particular
entity
is
an
arm
of
the
state
is,
i
think
in
general,
certainly
in
this
case,
a
completely
separate
from,
separate
issue
from
the
question
whether
there
has
been
a
breach
of
contract.
it
simply
involves
an
examination
of
what
the,
of
where,
of
what
place
puerto
rico
aqueduct
and
sewer
authority
has
in
the
legal
structure
of
the
puerto
rican
government.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
would
not
follow.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
because
the
nature
of
the
sovereign
immunity
claim
in
an
eleventh
amendment
context
is
different
from
the
sovereign
immunity
claim
for
the
united
states.
when
sovereign
immunity
is
claimed
by
a
state,
or
puerto
rico,
what
it
is
claiming
is
that
another
sovereign
has
no
authority
to
call
it
to
the
bar
of
the
court
and
demand
that
it
answer.
the
sovereign
immunity
claim
of
the
united
states
in
its
own
courts
is,
does
not
involve
the
underlying
dignitary
interest
of
one
sovereign
demanding
that
another
answer.
so
that
the
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
interest
is
much
more
akin
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
interest
where
the
law
is
i
think
uniformly
clear
in
the
lower
courts
that
a
denial
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
is
immediately
appealable
because
of
the
underlying
purpose.
and
this
court
last
term
in
the
argentina
against
weltover
case
indeed
ruled
on
the
merits
of
a
foreign
sovereign
immunity
claim
where
the
order
came
up
from
the
district
court
on
a
collateral
order
without
questioning
the
propriety
of
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i'm
not
entirely
sure
what,
how
the
united
states,
the
domestic
sovereign
immunity
case
ought
to
come
out.
the
point
that
i'm
making
here
is
that
the
underlying
dignitary
interest
of
one
sovereign
imposing
its
authority
on
another
is
not
present
there.
whether
there
is
another--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
because
to
start
with,
whether
the
united
states
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
will
in
general
be
the
same
question
as
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
because
the
causes
of
action
tend
to
be
in
fact
the
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
i
think,
with
the
united
states.
but
on
the
third
factor
as
well,
the
question
of
whether
a
denial
is
unreviewable
after
the
final
judgment,
in
turn
i
think
goes
back
to
the
question
of
what
the
nature
of
the
right
is,
whether
it's
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
and
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
and
state
sovereign
immunity
context
the
reason
i
think
we
know
that
it
is
such
a
right
is
that
the
underlying
interest
is
present
from
the
beginning
of
the
lawsuit,
that
one
sovereign
through
its
courts
not
essentially
fail
to
respect
the
dignity
of
another
sovereign.
so
i
think
the
united
states
case
is
a
different
case.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
as
far
as
i
am
aware
the
only
full
discussion
of
this
issue
in
the
first
circuit
is
in
the
libby
against
marshall
case.
that's
the
case
that
the
court
below
in
this
case
relied
on,
and
that
case
doesn't,
as
i
recall,
contain
any
extensive
discussion
of
any
argument
about
the
dignitary
interest.
it
simply
looks
at
ex
parte
young
and
edelman
against
jordan,
concludes
that
as
a
practical
matter
there
is
not
really
much
left
to
the
eleventh
amendment
after
those
cases
except
an
interest
in
avoiding
monetary
judgments.
that
i
think
is
where
it
went
wrong.
the
young
and
edelman
doctrines
do
not
rest
on
the
judgment
that
the
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
somehow
limited
to
a
protection
against
certain
judgments.
they
reflect
a
decision
that
because
of
the
needs
of
the
federal
system,
whatever
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is,
it
has
to
be
overridden
in
certain
circumstances.
and
one
primary
indication
of
that
is
that
after
edelman
came
down
the
argument
was
in
fact
presented
to
this
court
that
edelman's
focus
on
monetary
relief
really
did
change
the
nature
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
rendered
it
merely
a
limit
on
monetary
judgments,
and
this
court
explicitly
rejected
that
argument
in
cory
against
white
and
implicitly
did
so
in
alabama
against
pugh.
it
would
also,
i
think,
be
a
mistake
to
overread
young
and
edelman
because
those
cases,
after
all,
apply
in
only
one
type
of
eleventh
amendment
case,
only
in
official
capacity
suits
brought
against
state
officials
under
federal
law.
the
whole
young-edelman
distinction
based
on
monetary
relief
has
no
application
in
a
case
like
this
one
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one,
it's
not
brought
against
state
officials,
and
second,
it
is
brought
under
state
law.
so
i
think
where
the
first
circuit
went
wrong
was
in
misreading
one
limitation
on
one
class
of
cases
that
raise
eleventh
amendment
issues
as
transforming
the
nature
of
the
underlying
interest
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think
that
the
answer
would
be
the
same,
that
when
a
individual
state,
when
a
state
official
is
sued
in
his
or
her
official
capacity
and
the
claim
is,
and
that
official
says
this
suit
is
improper
because
the
claim
is
barred
by
edelman
against
jordan,
is
really
a
claim
for
retrospective
monetary
relief,
that
what
that
claim
means
is
that
the
state
official
is
saying
i
am
the
state.
and
when
the
state's
official
says
i
am
the
state,
that
means
that
the
state
is
asserting
a
right
not
to
be
tried.
it
is
true
in
that
circumstance
that
there
is
a
different
issue
presented
about
whether
the
claim
about
the
nature
of
the
relief
is
wholly
collateral
to
the
merits
of
the
litigation,
an
issue
that's
not
at
all
presented
when
the
claim
is
made
by
a
state
entity.
but
i
do
think
that
the
answer
would
end
up
being
the
same
because
in
that
case,
as
in
this,
the
court
need
not
determine
the
facts,
what
the
defendant
did,
or
the
law
in
the
sense
of
whether
those,
that
conduct
violated
any
applicable
legal
norm.
the
basic
sources
for
determining
that
the
right
at
issue
here
is
a
right
not
to
be
tried
begin
with
the
language
of
the
eleventh
amendment
itself.
that
language
focuses
on
protecting
states
from
the
very
bringing
of
the
lawsuit
and
from
the
entire
process
of
litigation,
and
not
just
from
the
judgment,
when
it
speaks
of
the
whole
judicial
power
being
excluded
from
a
suit
when
it
is
commenced
and
while
it
is
prosecuted.
this
court's
opinions
also
repeatedly
treat
the
right
as
a
right
not
to
be
sued.
all
other
circuits
except
the
first
that
have
addressed
this
issue,
eight
now
in
number,
agree
that
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity
claim
raises
a
right
not
to
be
tried
and
is
therefore
immediately
appealable.
and,
as
i
noted,
the
closest
analogy,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
is
treated
uniformly
the
same
way.
i'd
like
to
make
one
final
point.
the
dignitary
interest
that
underlies
the
claim
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
must
be
treated
as
real
and
important
even
though
it
is
necessarily
somewhat
abstract.
that's
why
the
states
reacted
so
swiftly
to
chisolm
against
georgia,
why
framers
like
madison
and
hamilton
and
chief
justice
marshall
made
such
a
point
of
reassuring
the
states
that
their
sovereign
immunity
would
be
respected
under
the
constitution,
and
it
is
why
this
court
has
kept
the
ex
parte
young
doctrine
a
limited
one
and
has
set
high
standards
for
finding
a
waiver
or
congressional
abrogation
of
the
immunity.
if
the
immunity
is
important
in
all
of
those
respects,
then
in
cohen's
terms
it
is
too
important
to
be
denied
review.
for
those
reasons
we
suggest
that
the
first
circuit
was
wrong
and
that
its
holding
should
be
reversed
so
that
the
very
harm
the
immunity
protects
against
will
not
be
irreparably
suffered
before
an
appeal
can
be
taken.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
have
no
rebuttal.
thank
you.
