but
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
do
you
think
it's
a
jurisdictional
question
whether--
justice
byron
r.
white
--whether
puerto
rico
is
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
we
raise
the
issue
sua
sponte
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
instrumentality
issue
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
suggest
affirmance
on
that
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
if
we
were
impressed
by
this
argument,
and
i
don't
say
we
shouldn't
be,
but
why
shouldn't
we
just
remand
and
ask
the
first
circuit
to
decide
whether
this
instrumentality
deserves
to
be
treated
like
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
think
the
first
circuit
assumed
that
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
it...
rather
than
decide
that
question
it
preferred
to
differ
from
how
many
courts
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sipkins,
the
court
of
appeals
though
decided
that
cohen
just
didn't
apply
and
treated
the
case
as
though
puerto
rico
itself
was
before
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
issue
that
we,
i
thought
we
were
addressing
here,
and
we
don't
need
to
say
that
the,
that
this
instrumentality
is
the
state.
i
suppose
we
could
disagree
with
you
on
the
appealability
issue
and
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
an
issue
that
it
didn't
decide.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so...
but
you
suggest
that
we
don't
even
decide
the
appealability
issue
but
just
remand
to
decide
the
instrumentality
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion.
