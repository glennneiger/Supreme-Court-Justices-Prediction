justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
is
jurisdictional
we're
assuming
it
to
be
true,
aren't
we?
we're
assuming
that
there
is
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
purposes
of
the
question
we
are
reaching
we
are
assuming
that
there
is
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
it
were
jurisdictional
we
would
have
authority
to
behave
that
way,
wouldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
issue
is
not
before
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taranto,
if
we
agree
with
you
here,
does
it
mean
that
there
would
be
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
all
federal
tort
claims
cases
whenever
the
government
asserts
that
it
has
not
waived
liability
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
i
mean,
my
impression
is
that
those
cases
have
not
been
interlocutorily
appealed,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
follow?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
somehow
in
the
domestic
sovereign
immunity
situation
there
is
no
right
not
to
be
tried,
there
is
just
a
right
not
to
have
a
judgment?
is
that
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
difference,
but
why
is
it
a
difference
that
ought
to
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
sure,
it's
a
different
issue,
but
none
of
the
cohen
factors
are
any
different
by
reason
of
that.
i
mean,
all
the
cohen
factors
would
apply
to
that
the
same
way
as
they
apply
to
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sipkins,
your
argument
is
that
it's
only
meant
to
protect
the
state
fisk?
how
does
that
square
with
the
fact
that
we
have
held
that
it
does
protect
the
states
against
equitable
actions?
isn't
that
something
of
an
obstacle
to
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
our
earlier
cases
that
say
you
cannot
bring
equitable
actions
against
the
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
leave
them
there,
but
they're
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
then
the
theory
you
are
urging
upon
us
today
is
inconsistent
with
those
cases,
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
isn't,
why
isn't
that
question
a
matter
of
law
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
boy,
that's
a
strange
kind
of...
i
mean,
there
are
always
factual
questions.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
abstract
question
of
law
that's
presented.
i
mean,
you
have
to
decide
whether
the
individual
sued
is
indeed
the
treasurer
of
the
state.
i
mean,
that's
a
question
of
fact,
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
whenever
there's
a
question
of
fact
the
game
is
off?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
shadings
of
questions
of
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
paint
those
shadings
in
deciding
this
question
of
whether
there
should
be
an
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
without
some
factual
content,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sipkins--
--go
ahead.
i
don't
want
to
proceed.
mr.
sipkins,
do
you
propose
that
we
apply
this
new
approach
to
the
other
areas
of
entitlement
to
interlocutory
appeal
as
well?
i
mean,
we
certainly
don't
do
this,
this
balancing
that
you
propose,
this
inquiry
into
whether
there
are
any
factual
issues
involved,
we
don't
do
it
in
the
double
jeopardy
area,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
do
it
for
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
ultimately
even
this
argument
collapses
back
into
your
first
argument
that
there
is
no,
no
categorical
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
i
think
this
is
an
eleventh,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
like
the
speech
or
debate
clause
or
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
that
it
entitles
the
state
to
stay
out
of
the
court,
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
treat
this
any
different
from
the
way
we
treat
claims
under
those
clauses.
