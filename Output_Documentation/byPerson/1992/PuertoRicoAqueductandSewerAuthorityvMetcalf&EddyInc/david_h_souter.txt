justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
taranto,
i
didn't
go
back
in
the
first
circuit
cases
behind
this
one,
the
ones
that
they
relied
on
for
precedent.
do
the
earlier
first
circuit
cases
turn
on
the
distinction,
a
distinction
based
on
the
need
to
respect
the
dignitary
interest,
i.e.
even
though
instrumentalities
of
the
state
may
ultimately
be
entitled
to
share
in
the
immunity
they
do
not
present
such
an
insistent
dignitary
claim
that
we
will
accord
them
an
immediately
appealable
status?
do
the
cases
turn
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
wasn't
it
phrased
in
terms
of
judgments
rather
than
suits?
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
still,
perhaps
from
your
standpoint,
stuck
with
the
text,
and
the
text
still
says
suits,
not
judgments.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
for
what
it's
worth,
those
open
issues
of
fact
are
not
in
any
way,
at
least
that
i
understand,
implicated
by
the
issues
raised
by
the
suit.
i
mean,
whether
you
overcharged
them
or
whether
you
didn't
overcharge
them
is
not
going
to,
i
presume,
involve
litigation
about
their
status
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes.
so
what
is
to
be
gained
by
saying
it
shouldn't
be
litigated
now?
