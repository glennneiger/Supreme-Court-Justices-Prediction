mr.
taranto,
did
you...
we
haven't
held
that
puerto
rico
is
a
state
for
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
have
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
really
an
open
question
in
this
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
we
held
that
an
agency
of
this
state,
apart
from
the
state
itself,
is
entitled
to
anything
more
than
protection
against
monetary
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
alabama
itself
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--wasn't
the
state
itself
a
party
in
that
case?
