well,
i
take
it
that
if
the
claim
of
immunity
were
somehow
bound
up
with
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
case
the
result
could
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
understanding
the
principles
of
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
same
problem
as
does
the
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
very
fundamental
position
that
the
idea
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
was
the
explicit
articulation
in
hans
v.
louisiana,
a
rationale
that
four
of
the
justices
explored
very,
very
carefully
in
pennsylvania
v.
union
gas,
simply
be
overturned.
true,
i
suppose
that's
open
to
you
to
argue
and
to
us
to
decide,
but
that
hasn't
really
been
the
terms
in
which
the
issue
has
been
joined.
it
seems
to
me
the
states
would
be
very
surprised
if
we
used
this
case
as
a
vehicle
for
a
wholesale
revision
of
the
eleventh
amendment
doctrine.
