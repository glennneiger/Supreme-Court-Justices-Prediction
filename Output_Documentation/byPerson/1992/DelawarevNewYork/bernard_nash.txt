mr.
bernard
nash
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
speak
today
on
behalf
of
44
states
in
support
of
the
recommendations
made
by
the
special
master.
a
threshold
issue
before
the
court
is
which
state
should
escheat
unclaimed
securities
distributions
that
become
stuck
in
the
hands
of
financial
intermediaries
in
the
course
of
transmission
from
issuers
to
beneficial
owners.
the
special
master
recommended
that
the
state
of
the
issuer
has
a
superior
equitable
claim
over
the
state
of
whatever
intermediary
happens
to
be
holding
the
distribution
when
it
becomes
stuck.
the
existence
of
intermediaries,
he
held,
does
not
change
the
fundamental
economic
relationship
between
the
issuer
and
its
investor.
the
intermediary
never
had
and
does
not
now
have
any
ownership
interest
in
the
distribution.
if
it
did,
it
would
not
be
unclaimed
property.
the
special
master's
conclusion
was
fully
consistent
with
the
precedents
of
this
court...
in
texas
v.
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
v.
new
york.
we
agree
that
those
precedents
should
be
followed.
in
texas
v.
new
jersey,
the
ruling
of
this
court
accorded
escheat
priority
to
the
state
of
the
issuer,
not
to
the
state
of
any
intermediary,
the
issuer
being
sun
oil.
there
were
intermediaries,
transfer
agents
and
paying
agents,
in
that
case.
delaware
and
new
york
segment
into
a
number
of
separate
transactions
the
payment
of
dividends
and
interest
by
an
issuer
to
its
stockholders
as
those
distributions
are
transmitted
through
brokerage
firms
and
other
intermediaries.
the
master
correctly
rejected
their
segmentation
and
state-law-based
theories.
he
explicitly
utilized
this
court's
guiding
principles
of
fairness
and
ease
of
administration
in
his
recommendation.
in
texas
v.
new
jersey,
this
court
held
fairness
to
be
one
of
two
criteria,
and
this
court
defined
fairness
to
accord
escheat
priority
to
the
state
that
gave
the
benefits
of
its
economy
and
laws
to
the
company
whose
business
activities
made
the
intangible
property
come
into
existence.
mr.
bernard
nash
with
respect--
mr.
bernard
nash
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
his
second
recommendation
of
whether
you
change
the
locational
test
from
state
of
incorporation
to
principal
executive
office.
his
first
recommendation
that
as
between
the
state
of
the
issuer
or
the
state
of
the
conduit
intermediary
broker
firm
is
in
full
accord
with
both
texas
v.
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
v.
new
york.
mr.
bernard
nash
i
would
concede
that
the
broker
intermediaries
would
be
considered
one
of
several
debtors
for
a
single
transaction,
exactly
as
the
master
held.
he
explained
in
his
recommendation
that
in
this
type
of
a
transaction
there
are
multiple
intermediaries,
that
the
issuer
is
a
debtor
for
certain
aspects
of
state
law,
the
intermediaries
are
debtors
for
certain
aspects
of
state
law.
the
uniform
commercial
code
merely
accords
the
issuer
an
affirmative
defense.
the
only
statute
before
the
court
in
1965
in
texas
v.
new
jersey
was
the
pennsylvania
escheat
statute.
that
pennsylvania
escheat
statute,
which
is
attached
to
the
master's
report
in
the
original
1965
case,
defined
holder
as
someone
indebted
to
another,
which
therefore
meant
sun
oil.
it
also
defined
holder
as
someone
in
possession
of
the
property,
which
meant
the
transfer
agents
and
paying
agents.
the
only
explicit
discussion
of
state
law
in
texas
v.
new
jersey
resulted
in
the
court
expressly
rejecting
state-law-based
rules
relating
to
technical
concepts
of
domicile,
choice
of
law,
and
texas'
claim
that
state
law,
which
defined
mineral
interests
and
royalties
as
real
property,
should
control.
in
standard
oil
v.
new
jersey
in
1951,
the
court
explicitly
rejected
the
uniform
stock
transfer
act
as
a
basis
for
defining
the
federal
law
of
escheat.
the
delaware-new
york
state-law-based
approach
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
general
policy
of
not
deciding
original
jurisdiction
cases
based
on
state
law.
debtor
was
used
as
shorthand
both
in
texas
v.--
mr.
bernard
nash
--that
is
not
the
issue
faced
by
the
court.
the
court
is--
mr.
bernard
nash
--the
purposes
of
state
debtor-creditor
law
were
for
purposes
entirely
unrelated
to
the
principles
underlying
escheat
priority
between
the
states.
the
court
in
texas
v.
new
jersey
specified
the
dual
criteria
which
would
be
used
to
determine
escheat
priority.
it
identified,
as
criteria
number
1,
fairness,
and
criteria
number
2,
ease
of
administration.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct.
the
term
debtor
was
used
descriptively
as
a
shorthand,
as
a
referent
to
identify
the
company
whose
domiciliary
state
had
superior
equitable
interest.
mr.
bernard
nash
because
that
would
not
be
fair
under
the
criteria--
mr.
bernard
nash
--no,
it
would
not
be--
mr.
bernard
nash
--it
would
not
be
fair
because
this
court's
equitable
criteria
indicates
that
if
the
person
entitled
to
the
funds
cannot
be
found,
then
the
contra
party
ought
to
be
the
entity
that
created
the
wealth
and
the
property
that
has
been
abandoned,
and
if
you
cannot
return
it
to
the
true...
to
the
state
of
the
true
owner
which
has
the
asset,
if
you
will,
then
instead
of
it
being
in
limbo
or
going
to
the
united
states
of
america,
it
ought
to
go
back
to
the
state
where
the
activities
took
place
that
created
the
wealth
which
is
now
lost.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
the
primary
rule,
and
the
question
is,
under
the
secondary
rule,
that
is
the
question
presented
in
this
case...
when
the
beneficial
owner
cannot
be
identified
for
escheat
purposes,
which
state
has
the
equitably
superior
claim
for
that
property?
mr.
bernard
nash
no.
that
would
be
a
question
of
state
law.
what
your...
what
texas
v.
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
v.
new
york
deal
with
is
contests
and
disputes
between
the
states.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct,
but
new
york
statute
would
not
be
constitutional
if
it
would
then
seek
to
take
property
from
its
citizens
inconsistent
with
the
rules
of
this
court,
because--
mr.
bernard
nash
--it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
whether
new
york
has
the
power
to
take
from
that
citizen.
getting
back
to
the
question
asked
a
moment
ago,
with
respect
to
looking
to
federal
common
law
versus
state
law,
this
court
has
held
in
several
cases
that
in
contests
between
states
the
court
looks
to
federal
common
law
and
does
not
borrow
from
state
law.
if
we
were
to
follow
the
delaware-new
york
approach
and
allow
escheat
priority
to
be
accorded
the
locational
state,
be
it
state
of
incorporation
or
state
of
principal
executive
office
of
the
financial
intermediary,
that
would
result
in
a
grossly
inequitable
movement
of
funds
to
but
one
or
two
states.
for
example,
under
delaware's
theory,
owner-unknown,
unclaimed
interest
paid
by
taxpayers
of
california
and
california
municipalities,
for
example,
or
any
other
state,
paid
on
municipal
bonds,
would
be
escheated
not
by
the
state
of
the
taxpayer
but
by
another
state,
depending
solely
upon
the
fortuity
of
where
california's
distribution
got
stuck.
if
it
happened
to
get
stuck
at
dtc,
new
york
would
escheat
because
dtc
is
incorporated
in
new
york.
if
it
happened
to
get
stuck
at
merrill
lynch,
delaware
would
escheat
because
it...
merrill
lynch
happens
to
be
incorporated
in
delaware.
mr.
bernard
nash
physical
property
has
always
been
escheated
where
found.
mr.
bernard
nash
state
power
over
physical
property
depends
upon
the
location
of
the
physical
property.
state
power
over
intangible
property
depends
upon
the
location
of
the
intangible
property,
and
this
court
has
held
in
innumerable
cases
that
the
intangible
property
has
touched
a
large
number
of
states,
so
that
any
number
of
states
would
have
the
power
to
escheat
intangible
property,
and
that
has
led
to
the
texas--
mr.
bernard
nash
--no,
but
many
states
touch
upon
the
intangible
property.
if
you
have
distributions
of
a
company
incorporated
or
principal
executive
office
in
one
state
and
the
investor
is
in
another
state,
and
the
contract
is
entered
into
in
a
third
state,
all
i
am
saying
is
not
that
any
state
in
the
world
can
be
fabricated--
mr.
bernard
nash
--but
many
states
have
citizens
who
touch
the
intangible
property
before
the
transaction
is
completed,
and
each
would
have
the
power
to
escheat,
and
the
question
before
the
court
is,
which
state
should
have
the
equitable
superiority.
mr.
bernard
nash
i
respectfully
disagree.
texas
v.
new
jersey
rejected
the
situs
as
the
location.
if
anything,
it
is
the
delaware
rule
that
the
situs
of
the
property,
meaning
the
situs
of
the
holder,
should
escheat.
that
is
what
was
rejected
in
texas
v.
new
jersey.
texas
v.
new
jersey
resolved
that
the
state
of
the
issuer...
because
sun
oil
was
the
issuer,
had
the
authority...
the
equitable
superiority
of
the
right
to
escheat.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
federal
money
order
statute,
which
was
adopted
by
the
congress
to
govern
escheat
priority
among
the
states,
and
not
state
laws
developed
for
unrelated
purposes,
provides
in
our
opinion
far
better
guidance
than
state
debtor-creditor
law.
in
that
statute,
congress
gave
escheat
priority
to
the
state
in
which
the
property
originated.
the
state
of
the
intermediary,
western
union,
was
accorded
last
place
in
the
quest
to
escheat.
another
relevant
federal
policy
may
be
found
in
the
sec
proxy
rules,
which
permit
issuers
to
bypass
intermediaries
and
transmit
proxy
materials
and
corporate
communications
directly
to
beneficial
owners.
mr.
bernard
nash
they
do
not.
they
range
from
3
to
7,
and
it
might
be
one
or
two
that's
longer
than
7.
mr.
bernard
nash
the
master's
recommendation
that
the
locational
test
be
changed
to
state
of
principal
executive
office
does
depart
from
precedent,
unlike
his
first
recommendation
that
precedent
controls,
and
that
the
state
of
the
issuer
rather
than
the
state
of
the
intermediary
has
escheat
priority.
mr.
bernard
nash
they
did
not.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct,
and
four
additional
states
have
not
filed
exceptions
to
that
aspect
of
the
recommendation.
delaware
and
new
york
contend
that
stare
decisis
precludes
this
modification,
viewing
stare
decisis,
of
course,
as
mechanical
formula.
they
rely,
however,
principally
if
not
exclusively
on
stare
decisis
decisions
involving
statutory
interpretation.
this
court,
however,
has
recognized
that
there
is
an
essential
difference
between
statutory
interpretation
on
the
one
hand
and
case
law
and
constitutional
interpretation
on
the
other.
it
is
axiomatic
that
when
the
reason
for
common
law
rule
no
longer
exists,
the
common
law
adapts.
in
this
case,
the
passage
of
time
has
eroded
the
rationale
underlying
the
state
of
incorporation
locational
test.
in
1965,
the
court
adopted
state
of
incorporation
as
the
locational
test
solely
because
of
the
administrative
infeasibility
then
of
implementing
a
main
office
or
principal
office
test.
the
court
expressly
stated
that
state
of
incorporation
was
a
minor
factor
and
rejected
it
as
the
primary
rule.
the
court
recognized
that
it
would
have
been
far
more
equitable
to
reward
the
state
in
which
the
issuer
maintains
its
principal
place
of
business
because
the
court
stated
that
is
the
state
that
probably
is
foremost
in
giving
the
benefits
of
its
economy
and
laws
to
the
company
whose
business
activities
made
the
intangible
property
come
into
existence.
the
principal
executive
office
test
recommended
by
the
master
also
would
satisfy
another
aspect
of
the
texas
v.
new
jersey
fairness
criteria
as
articulated
by
the
court,
namely,
distributing
escheats
among
the
states
in
the
proportion
of
the
commercial
activities
of
their
residents.
computer
data
bases
today
widely
used
throughout
the
securities
industry
make
it
feasible,
unlike
27
years
ago,
to
adopt
a
principal
executive
office
locational
test.
those
data
bases
permit
ready
access
to
principal
executive
office
information.
mr.
bernard
nash
you
are
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
court
was
talking
about...
they
used...
the
court
used
the
term,
main
office
and
principal
place
of
business
interchangeably,
and
they
were
trying
to
get
to
a
location
where
the
activities
took
place.
the
master's...
and
the
court
rejected
that,
rightly
so.
we
do
not
propose
that
today,
because
that
is
by
its
very
nature
subjective,
and
would
lead
the
court
into
a
quagmire
of
litigation
and
dispute.
principal
executive
office,
however,
is
a
close
proxy
to
the
goal
of
the
court.
it
is
objective.
there
is
only
one.
it
is
readily
identifiable.
every
public
company
must
file
one
or
another
type
of
report
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
at
least
annually,
if
not
more
frequently,
the
cover
page
of
which
must
identify
and
specify
not
only
the
state
of
incorporation
but
the
state
of
that
company's
principal
executive
office.
the
master
found
that
the
principal
executive
office
is
a
better
locational
proxy
for
where
the
activities
took
place
that
created
the
wealth,
and--
mr.
bernard
nash
--the
statements
made
in
the
briefs
are
gross
exaggerations.
they
encompass
companies
that
do
not
pay
dividends
or
interest.
this
court
may
take
judicial
notice
that
there
are
approximately
1,700
companies
listed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
and
the
master
found
that
there
are
less
than
1
percent
per
year
changing
their
principal
executive
office.
mr.
bernard
nash
that
is
correct,
and
the
master's
proposed
decree
states
that
the
principal
executive
office
shall
be
deemed
that
set
forth
on
the
sec
filing
within
the
12
months
preceding
the
escheat
period,
so
you
have
to
look
merely
to
one
principal
executive
office
per
year.
i
was
making
the
point
that
delaware
grossly
exaggerated
the
frequency
of
the
change.
in
fact,
with
the
advent
of
computer
data
bases
and
software,
it
is
just
as
easy
today
to
implement
a
principal
executive
office
rule
as
it
is
a
state
of
incorporation
test.
moreover,
congressional
guidance
again
in
the
money
order
statute
suggests
the
congressional
preference,
at
least
for
money
orders
and
travelers
checks,
of
principal
place
of
business,
which
this
is
close
to
but
not
quite,
rather
than
state
of
incorporation.
turning
to
disgorgement,
all
of
the
master's
recommendations
should
apply
to
all
of
the
property
in
this
case.
first,
the
master's
conclusion
that
the
relevant
state
is
that
of
the
issuer
should
apply
fully,
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
it
is
but
an
application
of
texas
v.
new
jersey,
not
a
change
in
any
existing
rule.
given
that
new
york
must
disgorge,
the
question
becomes,
which
locational
test
should
govern.
we
submit
that
the
funds
should
be
distributed
based
upon
the
new
principal
executive
office
test
adopted
in
this
case
should
the
court
adopt
the
master's
recommendation.
it
would
make
little
sense
to
adopt
an
equitably
superior
rule
and
then
distribute
the
funds
under
a
rejected
rule.
we
submit
that
no
reliance
interests
are
implicated.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
bernard
nash
--the
record--
mr.
bernard
nash
--yes,
justice
white.
the
record
shows
that
from
1985
through
1991,
new
york
escheated
approximately
$631
million.
i
would
state
that
new
york
continued
escheating
on
the
basis
of
its
primary
rule
theory
notwithstanding
that
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
1988
and
notwithstanding
that
in
1980
paine,
weber
refused
to
pay
over
such
funds
to
new
york
and
paine,
weber
put
new
york
on
notice
that
its
statute
did
not
authorize
the
escheat.
mr.
bernard
nash
since
1985
that
is
the
average.
i
just
cannot
state
the
numbers
are
higher
or
lower
prior
thereto.
i
might
add
that
in
texas
v.
new
jersey
the
court
awarded
disgorgement
on
a
fully
retroactive
basis.
indeed,
the
court
denied
a
motion
filed
after
the
decision
by
new
jersey
to
impose
a
2-year
limitations
period.
mr.
bernard
nash
i
do
not
recall
the
number,
but
far
less--
mr.
bernard
nash
--far
less
sums.
mr.
bernard
nash
but
it
is
a
rule
of
law
at
the
moment,
at
least.
mr.
bernard
nash
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact,
again,
by
running
through
the
same
data
bases
that
our
firm
ran
through,
that
approximately
21
percent
of
the
dividends
paid
by
new
york
stock
exchange
companies...
i
think
it
was
in
1990
or
1989,
i
forget,
were
paid
to
new
york
companies
that
have
principal
executive
offices
therein
and
under
a
state
of
incorporation
rule
i
believe
there
were
approximately
10
percent
would--
mr.
bernard
nash
--that
is
correct,
and
there
is
also
a
practical
limitation,
as
the
master
found,
and
that
is
the
records
really
do
not
exist
once
you
get
much...
sometime
in
the
mid-1970's
to--
mr.
bernard
nash
--comparing
the
two
tests,
delaware
has...
would
receive
somewhat
less
than
1
percent
of
the
money
under
a
state
of
principal
executive
office
rule
and
somewhere
between
40
and
50
percent
of
the
money
under
a
state
of
incorporation
rule.
again,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
that...
i
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that
from
data
bases.
thank
you.
