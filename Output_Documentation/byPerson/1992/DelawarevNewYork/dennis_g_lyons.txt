mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
started
as
a
sort
of
a
collection
case
brought
in
this
court
by
delaware
against
new
york
to
enforce
delaware's
rights
under
the
clear
teachings
of
the
backup
rule
promulgated
by
this
court
in
the
texas
case
in
the
mid-1960's
and
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
the
pennsylvania
case
in
the
early
1970's.
the
property
in
question
was
so-called
overages.
these
occur
when
an
issuer
of
securities
pays
a
dividend
to
its
holders
of
record
and
you
have
a
broker
or
some
other
party
that
holds
for
customers
or
clients
as
a
holder
of
record,
and
what
the
issuer
pays
is
more
than
what
the
broker
owes
to
its
customers.
it
also
occurs
when
the
brokers
are
paid
by
the
depository
trust
company,
which
we
will
call
the
dtc,
which
is
a
nominee
custodian
set
up
by
a
cadre
of
brokers
and
custodian
banks.
the
property
is
owed
here
to
unknowns.
that
is
the
agreed
position
of
49
of
the
states
except
for
new
york,
which
says
that
it
may
be
owed
to
knowns,
but
it
can't
identify
who
they
are
at
this
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
occurs,
i
believe,
because
of
the
activities
in
the
securities
markets,
that
you
have
an
issuer
who's
maintaining
a
record,
you
have
securities
which
are
traded,
and
they
sometimes
get
traded
in
semibearer
form.
in
other
words,
a
stock
certificate
comes
out,
it
is
endorsed
and
negotiable
in
blank
form,
and
it
passed
from
hand
to
hand,
and
the
issuer,
of
course,
doesn't
know
about
this.
it
pays
the
record,
and
that
results
in
someone
being
overpaid
and
someone
being
underpaid,
and
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
volume
of
trading
and
the
fact
that
we
have
a
stock-certificate-based
trading
system
in
most
areas.
this
does
not
involve
the
primary
rule.
the
case
is
narrowly
drawn
simply
to
involve
the
backup
rule.
the
primary
rule,
of
course,
involves
lost
stockholders,
people
who
are
on
the
record
but
who
the
issuer
can't
find,
who
the
issuer
has
addresses
for
but
has
lost
touch
with,
and
lost
customers
of
brokers,
and
we
estimate
in
our
brief...
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record...
that
the
universe
of
the
primary
rule
here,
the
escheats,
is
much
larger
than
that
of
the
backup
rule.
what
started
as
a
collection
case
turned
into
a
stampede.
one
by
one,
48
states
intervened,
and
they
came
up
with
a
position
that
was
different
from
the
positions
that
were
quite
common
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
in
this
case.
the
effect
of
these
positions
was
to
enlarge
the
size
of
the
universe
that
was
in
issue
in
the
case.
the
property
that
delaware
sought
was
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
brokers
who
were
incorporated
in
delaware.
the
property
that
the
intervenors
sought
for
themselves
was
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
dtc,
a
very
considerable
amount
of
property,
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
delaware
brokers,
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
brokers
incorporated
elsewhere,
and
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
new
york
custodian
banks,
which
make
a
specialty
upholding
securities
for
customers.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
delaware
would
prevail--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
it
would,
and
new
york
would
prevail
as
to
the--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--as
the
debtor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
as
the
debtor,
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position,
that
the
debtor
here
is
the
broker,
is
the
dtc,
but
in
particular,
since
the
dt
doesn't
concern
us...
new
york
gets
that
under
our
theory...
that
the
broker
is
the
debtor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
he
came
close
to
acknowledging,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
broker
was
a
debtor
under
state
law,
and
he
said
the
state
law
was
technical
and
that
what
we
needed
here
was
a
federal
common
law,
and
under
federal
common
law,
even
though
it
wasn't
the
case
under
state
law,
and
i
think
that's
quite
clear...
there's
a
litany
of
reasons
why
it's
clear...
we
will
treat
the
issuer
as
being
the
debtor.
he
had
a
little
process
whereby
he
teased
out
ambiguities,
and
after
he
finished
teasing
the
ambiguities
he
had
created
an
ambiguity,
and
he
resolved
it
with
a
tie-breaker,
in
a
sports
analogy,
and
the
tie-breaker
was
fairness,
and
the
principle
of
fairness
was
to
send
the
money
back
where
it
came
from,
and
the
money,
he
said,
came
from
the
issuer.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
beg
pardon?
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
that
was
the
decision
of
congress
in
a
very
narrowly
drafted
statute,
it
was
not
the
decision
of
this
court.
this
court
in
the
very
conservative
decision
by
justice
brennan
literally
applied
the
teachings
of
the
texas
case
to
that
matter,
and--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--western
union
couldn't
find
either
the
payee--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--or
the
sender.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
the--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--the
sender
was
still
the...
was
still
a
creditor
in
that
case,
and
if
they
had
an
address
for
the
creditor
they
were
to
escheat
it
to
the
sender
as
the
creditor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
he's
given
the
money
to
the
western
union.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
he's
given
the
money
to
the
western
union.
if
the
western
union
can't
find
his
son,
then
on
principles
of
equity
it
is
clear
under
state
law
that
western
union
can't
keep
the
money,
that
they
have
to
give
it
back
to
the
sender.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
oh,
they
do
in
this
sense.
they
do
not
owe
it
back
to
the
issuers.
it
is
quite
clear
that
they...
if
they
had
to
pay
it
back
to
the
issuer--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--that--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--they're
supposed
to
give
it
to
the
beneficiary.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
but
they...
in
the
meantime
they
were
earning
the
interest
on
it--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--they're
using
the
money
in
their
business.
most...
that
is,
of
course,
a
chronic
position
of
a
debtor
in
an
escheat
case,
that
in
all
these
cases
by
definition
the
debtor
in
an
escheat
case
owes
the
money
to
somebody
else,
but
if
that
person
cannot
be
found
within
the
period
of
latency,
then
you
have
an
escheat,
so
i
think
simply
to
say
that
the
debtor
owes
the
money
to
someone
else
doesn't
resolve
the
question.
it's
the
start
of
the
question.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you,
your
honor.
before
the
break,
i
was
making
the
point
that
state
law
should
govern
who
the
debtor
is
for
the
purpose
of
characterization
of
the
backup
rule.
under
the
state
law,
very
clearly
the
brokers
are
not
the
issuer's
agent,
and
the
issuer
is
no
longer
a
debtor.
the
issuer
has
paid
the
holders
of
record,
and
accordingly
has
no
further
obligation.
it
is
only
the
brokers
and
the
other
intermediaries
who
have
an
obligation.
they
are
a
debtor.
to
be
sure,
they
owe
the
money
to
somebody
else,
and
they
don't
know
who
they
owe
it
to,
but
the
issuer
is
not
a
debtor,
nor
is
the
issuer
their
creditor.
as
i
was
saying,
the
only
basis
for
applying
federal
common
law
here
is
to
create
a
rule
that
comes
out
differently
from
the
rule
as
it
would
come
out
under
the
laws
of
all
50
of
the
states.
what
we
have,
i
think,
is
a
change
for
the
sake
of
change,
and
a
change
for
a
purpose
that
was
rejected
in
the
texas
case
itself,
where
it
was
contended
that
the
mineral
rights
proceeds
should
go
back
and
escheat
to
the
state
of
texas
because
it
was
from
texas
soil
that
they
had
sprung,
and
the
court
rejected
that
theory
and
said
that
those
properties,
like
the
rest,
would
be
distributed
under
the
primary
rule
if
there
was
a
known
creditor
with
a
last-known
address
and
otherwise
under
the
backup
rule.
the
master,
besides
making
what
i
think
is
a
change
in
the
rule
that
the
debtor
should
be
the
debtor,
which
he
did
not
acknowledge
as
a
change,
made
an
acknowledged
change
by
changing
the
state
of
reference
for
the
debtor
from
being
the
state
of
incorporation
of
the
debtor
to
the
state
of
principal
executive
office.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
securities
industries'
brief
i
think
suggests
numerous
difficulties
with
that
because
of
the
way
it
focuses
on
the
operations
of
the
brokers,
and
they
make
numerous
suggestions--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--yes,
we
do
adopt...
we're
in
sympathy
with
their
position.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
rules
set
down
in
the
agreement
for
that
clearinghouse
quite
clearly
identify
the
holder
as
the
debtor
and
the
state
of
incorporation
of
the
holder
as
the
state
of
reference...
44
states
signed
that.
the
master
made
this
change
of
his
own
accord.
the
states
that
were
contending
for
the
issuer
as
debtor
at
that
time
were
contending
for
the
state
of
incorporation
as
the
reference
for
the
issuer,
or
for
whoever
was
the
debtor.
this
was
a
spontaneous
change.
there
was
no
discovery
on
the
merits
of
making
the
change.
there
was
no
discovery
as
to
really
what
a
principal
executive
office
was
and
what
reference
it
had
to
the
productive
facilities
of
a
corporation,
and
it
appears
from
business
publications
and
surveys
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
not
having
had
a
chance
for
discovery,
that
there
is
very
little
connection
between
the
principal
executive
office,
which
is
the
master's
rule,
and
the
productive
activities
of
the
corporation.
it's
just
the
place
where
the
executive
officers,
the
top
brass,
have
their
headquarters.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
does
not
adopt
the
issuer
as
debtor
rule,
that
the
change
falls
of
its
own
weight,
because
the
master
placed
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
the
10-q
report
and
the
10-k
report
that
issuers
of
securities
file
contain
this
information,
and
you
have
grievous
difficulties
applying
the
change
rule
once
you
get
beyond
the
realm
of
the
issuer.
but
in
any
event,
the
basis
that
the
master
gave
for
making
the
change
from
the
state
of
incorporation
was
that
it
was
fairer
because
it
spread
the
money
around
more
thoroughly.
in
other
words,
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it,
delaware
had
too
many
incorporations.
let
me
say
that
no
corporation
is
required
to
incorporate
in
delaware.
delaware's
statute
is
not
copyrighted.
it
can
be
copied
by
another
state,
and
some
of
them
have.
what
brings
corporations
to
delaware
is
a
perception
that
it's
judiciary
and
that
it's
legislature
function
in
the
best
interests
of
stockholders
and
in
the
best
interests
of
corporate
management
at
the
same
time,
that
they
have
a
balanced
approach.
the
rule
of
the
state
of
incorporation
is
a
rule
which
creates
an
equality
of
opportunity.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
that
the
money
goes
to
delaware,
the
money
goes
to
whatever
state
the
debtor
was
incorporated
in
if
the
backup
rule
is
applicable
and
every
state
has
an
equal
opportunity
to
do
that,
and
if
they
could
equal
delaware's
record
and
the
record
of
its
court
of
chancery
over
the
200
years
that
it
has
been
in
existence,
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
healthy
thing.
there's
clearly
no
administrative
ease
in
the
change.
the
administration,
even
in
the
context
of
issuer
as
debtor,
is
probably
more
difficult,
and
once
you
get
beyond
the
area
of
issuer
as
debtor,
where
you
do
not
have
a
10-k
and
a
10-q
to
serve
as
your
pole
star,
then
you
have
a
rule
which
is
difficult
of
administration,
and
i
don't
see
any
limiting
principle
in
the
master's
report
that
limits
the
change
in
the
rule
to
this
situation.
what
we
have,
then,
is
change
for
change's
sake,
i
believe.
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
reply
to
the
argument
of
new
york
that
the
property
here
really
could
be
shown
to
be
primary
rule
property,
i
would
urge
not
only
the
point
that
justice
scalia
made,
that
there
are
findings
of
the
master
that
impede
that
conclusion,
but
that
it
involves
the
proof
of
what
i
believe
to
be
an
impossibility.
and
that
is
that
i,
from
my
records,
can
ascertain
who
owns
a
stock
certificate
which
is
essentially
in
bearer
form
that
i
gave
to
mr.
x
on
october
15,
who
holds
that
stock
certificate
on
november
15,
which
is
the
record
date
for
the
dividend,
because
it
is
that
person
and
those
claiming
under
him
who
have
the
claim,
and
there
is
no
way
my
records
as
the
debtor,
as
the
delivering
broker,
can
show
who
owned
that
certificate,
who
had
that
certificate
in
his
vault,
at
any
moment
after
the
time
i
delivered
it
to
the
first
party.
addressing
the
arguments
of
the
intervenors,
it
is
said
that
the
issuer
under
state
law
is
one
of
many
debtors.
we
say
that
is
not
so,
that
section
8-207
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
says
that
the
issuer
is
not
a
debtor
once
it
has
paid
the
holder
of
record,
and
that
is
what
has
happened
here.
the
issuer
is
not
a
debtor
under
state
law.
it
is
said
to
be
an
affirmative
defense.
yes,
it's
an
affirmative
defense
called
payment,
and
payment
is
a
very
good
affirmative
defense.
it's
the
best
affirmative
defense
on
a
note
that
i
can
imagine.
the
location
rule
as
to
whether
we
will
admittedly
change
the
rules
from
the
state
of
incorporation
to
the
state
of
principal
executive
office,
obviously
implicates
the
hard
core
rules
of
stare
decisis.
this
is
a
rule
laid
down
by
the
court
in
emphatic
terms
that
it
was
setting
a
permanent
rule.
justice
black
says
that
over
and
over,
and
that
was
the
treatment
given
it
in
the
western
union
case.
congress
can
override
this
at
any
time
within
constitutional
limits.
this
is
like
a
statutory
interpretation.
it
is
subject
to
the
work
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--well,
because
this...
in
most
constitutional
interpretation
the
congress
can't
change
the
rules.
here,
congress
can
because
these
are
clearly
in
commerce,
these
distributions,
and
also
congress
has
certain
powers
under
section
5
of
the
due
process
clause
which
is
also
functional,
but
in
this
area,
clearly
you
have
distributions
in
commerce.
they're
the
same
basis
as
for
the
securities
laws.
finally,
it
is
said
that
there
are
changes
in
circumstance
from
1965
to
1992
making
the
state
of
incorporation
rule
obsolete.
there
are
none.
there
were
data
bases
back
then
that
have
the
principal
executive
office,
the
10-q
reports
and
the
10-k
reports
were
the
same,
have
the
same
cover
display,
and
there
are
data
bases
that
have
the
state
of
incorporation.
nothing
has
changed.
the
choice
is
the
same,
and
what
we
are
having
is
an
arbitrary
rule
not
originally
supported
by
the
parties
who
are
now
supporting
it,
which
the
master
decided
to
do.
there
were
some
questions
about
the
amount
of
disgorgement
in
this
case.
let
me
say
that
the
disgorgement
from
new
york
would
be
much
greater
under
the
rule
contended
for
as
the
issuer
as
debtor,
because
under
that
rule
new
york
would
lose
the
dtc
moneys
which
are
a
very
big
piece
of
this,
and
it
would
lose
the
money
for
the
new
york
incorporated
banks
and
the
new
york
incorporated
brokers.
there
are
some
of
them.
we
pursued
this
case
originally
as
a
collection
case,
that
this
was
something
which
was
clearly
covered
and
which
new
york
should
not
have
escheated
under
the
established
rules.
we
do
not
view
it
as
disgorgement,
we
view
it
as
collection.
what
you
have,
i
think,
if
the
rules
are
changed
to
redefine
the
issuer
as
debtor,
or
to
redefine
the
state
of
principal
executive
office,
is
a...
not
only
a
change
in
the
rules
which
will
unsettle
expectations
and
bust
the
budgets
of
a
number
of
states,
but
an
unwarranted
departure
from
an
area
where
certainty
should
be
the
rule.
thank
you,
your
honor.
