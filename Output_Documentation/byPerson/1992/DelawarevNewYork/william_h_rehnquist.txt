111
original,
the
state
of
delaware
v.
the
state
of
new

mr.
lyons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lyons.
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
p.m.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
resume,
mr.
lyons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lyons.
mr.
boone,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
is
basically
a
factual
argument
you're
making,
mr.
boone,
not
a
legal
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
boone.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nash.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean...
well,
okay.
mr.
nash,
what
if
a
claim
arises,
say,
in
mr.
boone's
state
of
new
york
between
a
property
owner
and
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
whether
property
in
that
state
should
escheat
to
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
is
the
state
of
new
york
bound
in
adjudicating
that
dispute
by
our
decision
in
this
case
and
in
our
earlier
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
rules
we
lay
down
in
these
cases,
and
i
do
mean
lay
down,
since
they
seem
to
be
made
up,
are...
just
bind
litigants
state
against
state,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
saying
that
our
decisions
do
bind
not
just
states
versus
states
but
a
new
york
private
litigant
against
the
state
of
new
york.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nash.
mr.
lyons,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lyons,
why
would
stare
decisis
here
apply
less
to
statutory
interpretation
rather
than
the
more
relaxed
form
that
applies
to
constitutional
interpretation
and
to
common
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lyons.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
111
original,
delaware
against
new
york
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
