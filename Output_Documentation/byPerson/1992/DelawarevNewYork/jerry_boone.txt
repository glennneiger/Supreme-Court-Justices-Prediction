mr.
jerry
boone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
stating
new
york's
concurrence
in
delaware's
analysis
with
respect
to
the
backup
rule
and
express
our
disagreement
with
delaware
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
primary
rule.
the
master's
report
is
propelled
by
the
notion
that
it
would
be
fairer
to
distribute
the
unclaimed
distributions
in
question
widely
among
the
states
rather
than
to
new
york
or
new
york
and
delaware
as
a
straightforward
application
of
the
texas
rule's
command.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
the
master's
notion
was
that,
since
these
are
basically
funds
that
are
stuck
among
intermediaries
who
have
no
beneficial
interest
in
those
funds,
it
would
be
more
equitable
to
return
those
funds
to
the
states
of
the
issuers
and
benefit
their
citizens,
because
they
generate
it,
if
you
will,
through
their
investment,
the
underlying
securities.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
your
honor,
that
may
be...
that
would
be
another
approach.
mr.
jerry
boone
what
we're
asking
for
is
that
it
be
distributed
pursuant
to
the
straightforward
rules
as
they
currently
demand.
mr.
jerry
boone
i
believe
it
is
fairer,
your
honor.
that's
new
york's
position,
that
the
court
has
told
new
york
and
all
states
27
years
ago
in
texas
v.
new
jersey
that
it
was
setting
down
very
clear
rules
for
establishing
state's
rights
in
determining
what
those
escheat
rights
are
and
intangible
obligations,
and
the
court
reaffirmed
that
in
pennsylvania
v.
new
york,
and
refused
to
modify
even
slightly
the
rule
based
on
the
same
fairness
notions
or
factors
that
motivated
the
master
here.
mr.
jerry
boone
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
would
suggest...
new
york
would
suggest
if
there's
something
particularly
unfair
in
this
particular
context
about
distributing
or
escheating
these
funds
pursuant
to
the
existing
black
letter
escheat
rules
as
set
down
by
this
court,
we
would
suggest
that
institutionally
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
left
to
congress
to
make
those
changes
as
it
did
with
respect
to
the
western
union
money
orders.
but
if
this
case
were
to
be
decided
on
fairness
grounds,
i
would
point
out
that
beneficial...
excuse
me,
brokers
and
other
financial
institution
intermediaries
do
have
beneficial
rights
in
these
funds,
as
i
will
elaborate,
because
our
argument
proceeds...
our
primary
rule
argument,
which
i'd
like
to
now
focus
on,
proceeds
from
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
primary
rule.
that
is,
you
identify...
the
right
to
escheat
belongs
to
the
state
of
the
creditor
as
identified
on
the
broker's
books
in
applying
the
last-known
address
principle.
applying...
well,
we
submit
that
it
is
possible
to
identify
with
respect
to
brokers...
i
should
clarify
with
respect
to,
again,
concurring
in
delaware's
analysis
with
respect
to
dtc,
depository
trust
corporation,
a
new
york
incorporated
entity,
and
custodial
banks,
new
york
custodial
banks.
there's
no
dispute
by
delaware
nor
any
other
party
in
this
litigation
that
those
funds
would
escheat
to
new
york
under
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
backup
rule,
new
york
being
the
state
of
incorporation
for
those
entities.
so
there
is
no
dispute,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
in
that
regard
to
follow
the
traditional
backup
rule.
mr.
jerry
boone
on
the
backup
rule
there
is
no
dispute.
there
is
a
dispute
on
the
primary
rule
with
respect
to
whether
it
can
be
applied
to
brokers,
and
i
will
turn
to
that.
the
master
concluded
that
it
was
not
possible
to
apply
the
primary
rule
to
two
brokers,
and
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion,
and
we
believe
that
the
record
will
reflect
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
presented
by
new
york's
theory
that
would
warrant
a
remand
to
allow
new
york
to
pursue
additional,
or
discovery
to
prove
certain
facts.
we're
on
a
very
limited
record
here,
where
the
master
directed
that
discovery
would
be
limited
to
exploring
the
general
architecture
and
structure
of
the
financial
institutions,
or
financial
services
industry,
so
we
were
not
allowed
to
pursue
more
detailed
discovery--
mr.
jerry
boone
--as
it
relates
to
our
theory.
mr.
jerry
boone
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
boone
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
boone
there
are
three
elements
to
our
factual
contention
that
the
brokers
can
be
identified,
the
creditor-brokers,
and
the
first
contention,
or
the
first
element,
is
that
brokers'
nominee
float
results
from
the
exchange
of
physical
certificates
between
brokers
and
banks,
and
the
failure
of
the
recipient
broker
or
bank
to
reregister
that
certificate
into
its
own
name
or
nominee
name
before
the
record
date.
therefore,
the
selling
broker
remains
the
registered
owner
and
is
paid
the
distribution
to
which
it
is
no
longer
entitled.
so
a
situation
arises
that
you
can
identify
from
the
selling
broker's
books,
who
would
be
the
debtor,
who
the
purchasing
broker
is,
which
would
be
the
creditor
under
our
analysis.
we're
not
asking
for
a
presumption.
what
we're
asking
for,
at
the
outset
of
this
litigation
we
introduced
an
affidavit
of
our
director
of
audits
for
unclaimed
funds,
which
has
not
been
refuted
in
this
record,
and
what
that
affidavit
established
was
that
it
was
possible
to
trace
a
particular
transaction
that
gave
rise
to
abandoned
property
holdings
with
a
creditor-broker.
those
particular
transactions
could
be
traced
from
a
debtor-broker's
books
and
records
to
identify
a
creditor-broker.
now,
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
transactions
that
occur,
so
it
would
be
impractical
to
trace
each
and
every
one
of
those,
so
what
we've
asked
the
court
to
do
is
to
approve
our
use
of
a
sampling
approach
which
the
court
has
approved
in
other
contexts,
most
notably
to
prove
racial
discrimination
in
employment
discrimination
suits
and
jury
selection
cases,
so
we're
asking
the
court
to
approve
that,
and
we
would
then
trace
pursuant
to
that
sample
a
certain
number
of
transactions
and
then
would
extrapolate
from
that
to
the
universe
of
such
transactions.
mr.
jerry
boone
prove
that
the
addresses
on
the
debtor
broker's
books
would
identify
a
creditor-broker
with
a
trading
address
in
new
york
in
almost
every
instance,
so
we're
not--
mr.
jerry
boone
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
jerry
boone
no,
your
honor.
under
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
primary
rule,
the
creditor
is
defined
as
the
apparent
owner
under
debtor-broker's...
or,
a
debtor's
books,
whether
that
debtor
is
a
record
holder
or
an
individual
partnership,
whatever.
so
what
would
be
identified
from
the
debtor-broker's
books
who
consummated
that
trade
to
his
contra
party,
another
broker,
that
will
be
reflected
on
the
debtor-broker's
books,
and
that
is--
mr.
jerry
boone
--not
necessarily,
but
the
primary
rule
as
it
currently
stands
does
not
require
the
exploration
of
ownership.
it
only
requires
that
you
identify
the
last-known
address
of
the
apparent
owner
that's
identified
on
that
debtor's
books
and
records.
mr.
jerry
boone
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
first
of
all,
i
should
point
out
that
the
creditor-broker
identified
on
the
debtor-broker's
books
is
the
apparent
owner,
may
be
the
beneficial
owner.
we
don't
know.
the
primary
rule
was
not
designed
to
probe
the
nature
of
the
ownership.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
if...
the
express
purpose
of
the
court's
primary
rule
as
we
understand
it,
at
least
heretofore,
is
that
it
be
effectuated
where
it
can,
and
we're
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
do
that,
and
we
believe
that
we
have
raised
an
issue
of
material
fact
on
this
record
that
would
warrant
additional
discovery
in
that
regard.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
the
master
concluded
that
the
creditor
is
the
beneficial
owner,
which
is
at
variance
with
the
traditional
understanding
that
the
creditor
is
the
apparent
owner,
the
obligee,
the
party
entitled
to
enforce
payment
of
the
debt.
so
having
concluded
that,
the
master
basically
said,
our
factual
argument
will
decide
the
point,
and
again,
we're
on
a
limited
record.
we
specifically...
the
parameters
of
the
limited
discovery
did
not
allow
probing
of
our
factual
theories
and
contentions,
and
they're
also
based
on
this
court--
mr.
jerry
boone
--the
beneficial
owner
has
been
paid.
it's
the
practice
of
the
industry,
as
all
of
the
various
financial
institutions...
the
brokers
and
the
banks
and
dtc...
testified
in
their
testimony,
that
they
pay
their
customer,
who
is
generally
regarded
as
the
beneficial
owner,
although
that
customer
may
be
acting
for
someone
else,
which
is
one
of
the
problems
of
trying
to
parse
the
notion
of
beneficial
ownership.
but
the
testimony
was
that
the
financial
institutions
would
pay...
do
pay
their
customers
on
the
pay
date
regardless
of
whether
the
financial
institution
itself
has
received
all
of
the
distribution
to
which
it
is
entitled
from
the
issuer's
paying
agent,
so
the
record
will
show
that
the
customer,
the
beneficial
owner,
is
paid.
what
we're
talking
about
are
funds
that
are
owed
that
are
lost
intra
brokers,
essentially...
that's
our
position...
and
again,
under
the
primary
rule
the
creditor
is
the
apparent
owner.
i
mean,
there
was
no
exploration
of
attributes
of
ownership
as
it
has
traditionally
been
interpreted
by
the
various
states
in
their
abandoned
property
acts
and
by
the
uniform
abandoned
properties
acts,
and
as
understood
by
the
financial
services
industry
as
reflected--
mr.
jerry
boone
--yes,
i...
that's
correct.
i
say
the
testimony
and
the
record
will
reflect
that
the
financial
institution
intermediaries,
if
you
will,
the
brokers
specifically
that
we're
referring
to
here,
routinely
pay
their
customers.
mr.
jerry
boone
we
were
allowed
within
the
general
parameters...
i
mean,
our
theory,
in
order
to
prove
it,
we
submit,
we
concede,
we
have
to
trace...
we
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to
trace
the
actual
transactions.
we
put
in
an
affidavit
at
the
very
outset
of
this
litigation
that
demonstrated
that
that
could
be
done.
it
was
based
on
the
sampling
of
debtor-brokers
in
new
york,
and
it
indicated
that
you
could
trace
a
particular
transaction
from
a
debtor-broker
and
establish
the
creditor-broker
which
would
be
in
new
york,
would
have
a
trading
address
in
new
york,
and
in
virtually
all
instances
that
has
not
been
refuted
on
this
record.
there
has
been
some
hypothecation
about
why
that
application
or
that
approach
would
fail.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
what
the
master
told
us
we
could
do
is
that
we
could
trace...
we
could
do
this,
but
it
has
to
be
done
on
an
individual
case-by-case
basis
and
you
have
to
be
able
to
establish
who
the
beneficial
owner
is.
when
a
broker
is
acting
as
a
debtor--
mr.
jerry
boone
--well--
mr.
jerry
boone
--no...
the
brokers
testified
that
they
don't
make
the
effort
to
determine...
to
do
the
tracing
or
to
discover
who
the
creditor
is.
the
debtor-broker
who
receives
the
overpayment
makes
no
effort,
unless
it
is
claimed
against,
to
demonstrate
who
that
creditor
is.
so
they
make
no
efforts,
that's
established
in
the
record.
what
we're
saying
is
that
it
can
be
done
if
we
are
permitted
to
make
the
effort.
mr.
jerry
boone
correct.
mr.
jerry
boone
well--
mr.
jerry
boone
--justice
scalia,
the
master
disagreed
with
our
initial
predicate...
premise
that
nominee
float
is
the
primary
cause
of
the
overage
that
results
in
escheating
to
new
york
or
another
state
under
the
application
of
the
primary
rule.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
from
brokers
that
nominee
float
is
the
principal
cause--
mr.
jerry
boone
--there
is,
but--
mr.
jerry
boone
--well,
i
think
what
is...
what
certainly
goes
to
our
raising
a
material
issue
of
fact
is
that
the
dtc
experience,
where
they
have
experimented,
and
this
is
in
the
record,
with
a
certificateless
security
for
the
last
3
years,
or
for
a
3-year
period,
there
was
no
unresolved
overage,
which
really
bolsters
and
confirms
the
testimony
that
nominee
float,
these
physical
certificates
floating
around
that
are
not
reregistered
before
the
record
date
to
the
new
owner,
is
the
principal
cause
of
the
overage.
mr.
jerry
boone
well,
our
argument
proceeds
from
the
premise
that
the...
under
the
primary
rule
that
the
creditor
is
the
apparent
owner,
which
the
master
disagreed
with,
so
it
is
a
mixed
law-fact
argument.
yes,
i
mean
there
are
the
factual
contentions
that
i've
elaborated
that
we
would
have
to
prove,
and
we
believe
the
evidence,
the
testimony
in
the
record,
raises
that
issue
of
fact
that
entitles--
mr.
jerry
boone
--well,
again,
we're
talking
about...
the
basic
problem
gets
back
to
the
contradiction
of
the
master's
finding
that
the
overage
that
we're
speaking
of
is
caused...
brokers
routinely
pay
their
customers.
mr.
jerry
boone
the
master
did
not--
mr.
jerry
boone
--find...
make
that
finding.
mr.
jerry
boone
we
submit
that
the
record
will
refute
that.
mr.
jerry
boone
that's...
they
are
beneficial
owners
in
the
sense
that
the
funds
are
owed
to
the
broker.
mr.
jerry
boone
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
boone
and
your
honor,
i
would
ask
that
with
respect
to
retroactivity
that
because
this
court
is
engaged
in
an
original
jurisdiction
rulemaking,
there
is
no
need
for
retroactivity.
mr.
jerry
boone
the
laws
are
being
changed.
mr.
jerry
boone
thank
you.
