justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
fairer?
i
don't
understand
why
it's
fairer
to
distribute
it
more
widely.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
we
could
give
it
to
the
federal
government.
then
it
would...
you
know,
we
could
distribute
it
the
way
all
the
people
want
it
to
be
distributed.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
another
approach,
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
also
offered
you
the
opportunity...
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this...
offered
you
the
opportunity
to
put
in
whatever
evidence
you
could
about
who,
indeed,
the
real
owners
are.
you
were
allowed
to
put
in
whatever
you
had.
is
that
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
was
lacking?
was
it
interparty
discovery?
i
mean,
what
was
the
master
supposed
to
do
if
you
didn't
have
this
evidence?
he
said
if
you
have
it,
you
can
put
it
in.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
no,
i
thought
he...
i
thought
he
found
you
didn't
even
prove
that
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
this
is
going
to
be
the
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure...
he
didn't
even
buy
the
fact
that
you
had
proved
the
generality
to
be
true,
and
whose
fault
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
problems.
one
is...
which
you
object
to,
and
i
understand
that.
that's
your
objection
in
principle,
that
you
should
not
have
to
do
it
in
each
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
by
one,
that
you
should
be
able
to
generalize
and
apply
some
statistical
generalization.
that's
one
problem,
and
i
give
you
that.
but
the
other
one
is,
as
i
understand
the
master,
he
didn't
believe
that
your
generalization
was
true.
he
didn't
believe
that
you
had
brought
in
enough
demonstration,
enough
factual
demonstration
that
this
statistical
analysis
was
correct
that
he
was
willing
to
buy
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
a
problem
of
proof
that
is
your
problem,
not
his.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
testimony
to
the
contrary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
he
just
wasn't
persuaded.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
suggesting
that
we
should
decide
in
all
of
these
cases,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
who
owes
what
to
whom?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
why
not?
i
mean,
if
you
feel
free
to
ignore
state
law
as
to
who
owes
what
to
whom
in
one
respect,
why
not
in
all
respects?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
had
no
reference
to
what
the
state...
who
the
state
thought
the
debtor
and
creditor
were.
that's
sort
of,
just
irrelevant.
all
we
have
to
consider
is
fairness
and
ease
of
administration.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'll
ask
the
question
i
asked
earlier.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
fairness
and
ease
of
administration,
why
not
just
make
it
all
payable
to
the
united
states?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
fair
because
of
what?
because
of
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
some
other
people
have
some
rights
to
this
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
always
look
to
the
true
owner?
this
gets
back
to
a
point
that
was
discussed
earlier.
how
do
we
apply
the
owner...
the
owner...
is
the
owner
considered
always
to
be
only
the
beneficial
owner?
we
always
look
through
the
equitable
owner
to
the
beneficial
owner,
is
that
the
rule
that's
applied?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
of
course,
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
we
were
not
talking
about
an
intangible
here
but
we
were
talking
about
personal
property
that
was
owed
from
one
person
to
another
and
it
was
handed
over,
transferred
from
one
state
to
another
physically,
whatever
state
it
happened
to
be
in
when
the
music
ended
would
be
the
state
that
would
have
authority
to
escheat,
wouldn't
it,
and
you'd
say,
gee,
that's
purely
arbitrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
aren't
all
our...
don't
the
rules
of
escheat
begin
with...
begin
with...
an
assumption
of
state
power
over
the
property,
and
state
power
over
the
property
depends
in
turn
upon
state
law
with
regard
to
such
matters
as
indebtedness.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
be
any
number,
literally?
we
could
just
set
forth
a
federal
rule
that
allows
any
state
whatever,
since
this
is
intangible
property--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
sounds--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
sounds
very
much
like
the
contacts
theory
that
was
explicitly
rejected
in
texas
v.
new
jersey,
the
kind
of
theory
that
is
used
in
conflict
of
laws,
and
we
explicitly
said
that's
a
bad
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
principal
executive
office?
in
texas
v.
new
jersey,
we
really
didn't
talk
about...
we
didn't
talk
about
principal
executive
office.
we
said,
in
some
respects
the
claim
of
pennsylvania,
where
sun's
principal
offices
are
located,
is
more
persuasive.
it
isn't
clear
to
me
they
were
just
talking
about
principal
executive
offices.
they
were
talking
about
their
main
place
of
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
those
filings,
as
i
understand
from
the
briefs,
change
every
year.
that
is,
the
office
listed
on
the
front
changes
annually,
and
if
you
don't
know
when
the
payment
that
goes
with
a
particular
stock
was
made,
how
can
you
tell
what
was
their
executive
office
at
that
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
something
like
$26,000,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
weren't
really
changing
the
prior
decision
in
that
case,
either.
we
were
laying
down
the
rule
for
the
first
time.
do
you
happen
to
know,
mr.
nash,
whether
new
york
would
have
to
disgorge
more
under
the
principal
executive
office
test
that
you
propose
than
it
would
under
the
place
of
incorporation
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
probably
do...
they'd
probably
have
to
turn
over
less,
or
disgorge
less
under
the
rule
that
you
propose
as
opposed
to
the
state
of
incorporation.
