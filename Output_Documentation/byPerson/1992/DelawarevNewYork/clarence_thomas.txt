justice
clarence
thomas
this,
in
a
state
dispute,
is
before
the
court
under
our
original
jurisdiction.
at
issue
are
unclaimed
securities
distributions
held
by
intermediaries
in
their
own
names
on
behalf
of
beneficial
owners
cannot
be
identified
or
located.
new
york
escheated
$360
million
in
such
funds
without
regard
to
the
beneficial
owner's
last
known
address
or
in
intermediary's
state
of
incorporation.
delaware
initiated
this
original
action
alleging
wrongfully
escheat.
a
special
master
recommended
that
the
right
to
escheat
be
awarded
to
the
state
of
the
securities
issue
as
principal
executive
offices.
both
delaware
and
new
york
lodged
exceptions.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
sustain
the
exceptions
in
part
overruled
the
exceptions
in
part
and
remand.
the
state
in
which
an
intermediary
is
incorporated
has
a
right
to
escheat
in
this
case.
we
would
ordinarily
award
the
right
to
escheat
to
the
state
in
which
a
creditor
has
a
last
known
address,
but
because
a
beneficial
owners
cannot
be
located,
we
award
the
right
to
escheat
to
the
state
in
which
each
intermediary
as
debtor
is
incorporated.
we
therefore,
sustain
delaware's
and
new
york's
exceptions
to
the
master's
contrary
conclusion.
we
also
sustain
delaware's
exception
to
the
master's
proposal
to
award
the
right
to
escheat
to
the
state
in
which
the
debtor
has
its
principal
executive
offices
rather
than
to
the
state
in
which
the
debtor
is
incorporated.
finally,
we
reject
new
york's
claim
to
a
right
to
escheat
based
on
statistical
evidence
that
most
of
the
relevant
creditors
are
brokers
with
new
york
addresses.
a
state
wishing
to
claim
the
right
to
escheat
must
prove
transaction
by
transaction
that
a
particular
creditor
had
a
last
known
address
within
that
state.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
have
joined.
