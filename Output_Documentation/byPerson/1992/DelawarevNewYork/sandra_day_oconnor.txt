why
does
this
occur
so
often
and
generate
so
much
revenue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lyons,
if
we
were
to
apply
the
rule
and
the
backup
rule
and
the
doctrines
enunciated
by
this
court
in
prior
cases,
does
that
mean
delaware
would
prevail
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it's
the
state
of
incorporation
of
the
holder--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
dividends.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
treating
the
holder
as
the
creditor--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--debtor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
the
special
master
didn't
take
that
view
and
didn't
treat
the
broker
as
the
debtor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
why
isn't
it
fairer
to
just
follow
the
court's
precedents
here?
why
do
we
have
to
go
around
writing
new
rules?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
congress
can
certainly
step
in
and
change
the
formula
and
maybe
if
48
states
are
out
there
asking
them
to
do
it,
it
wouldn't
be
too
tough,
would
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
the
master--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
the
master
determine
that
the
money
we're
talking
about,
as
to
that
money,
the
creditors
are
not
known?
we
don't
know
the
identity
of
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
you're
arguing
is
for
the
application
of
some
sort
of
presumption
to
determine
who
the
creditors
are,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
was
the
master's
position
on
this
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
our
precedents
would
look
to
the
state
of
incorporation
if
it's
a
corporation
that
you're
looking
to
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
master
recommends
not
adhering
to
that
precedent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
to
that,
would
you
concede
that
under
most
state
law
the
broker
intermediaries
might
be
considered
the
debtors?
