justice
byron
r.
white
like
in
the
western
union
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
western
union
to
do
when
it
couldn't
find
the
payee,
the
money...
the
person
to
whom
the
money
was
sent?
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
they
couldn't
find
the
payee?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
did
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
sure
you
could
call
the
sender
necessarily
a
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
his
son,
or
something
like
that,
and
they
couldn't
find
the
son.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
these
broker
intermediaries
didn't
have
any
real
claim
to
the
funds
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
don't...
they...
if
they
could
find--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
may
be
but
if
they
could
find
the
ultimate
beneficiary
they
were
supposed
to
send
it
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
didn't
really
have
any
title
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
between
you
and
delaware,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
won't
tell
you
whether
the
creditor-broker
that
you
say
can
be
identified
is
holding...
would
have
been
trading
on
his
own
account
or
for
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
beneficial
owner
under
the
primary
rule,
even
as
we've
applied
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
get
to
the
record
only.
even
if
you
know
who
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
the
master
just
misunderstood
this
system
that
goes
on,
because
he
said...
i
thought
he
said
that
neither
these...
he
treated
the
delaware
and
new
york
entities
as
intermediaries
who
had
no
beneficial
interest
in
these
funds,
and
you
say
he's
just
wrong
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
couldn't
possibly
have
thought
that
you
had
made
out
a
credible
case
for
your
new
york
broker-creditors,
as
you
would
have
them,
really
had
a
beneficial
interest
in
these
proceeds
that
you're
claiming,
because
what
he
ended
up
saying
was
that
your
position
was
wholly
irrelevant
to...
in
terms
of
his
disposition
of
the
case,
which
he
couldn't
have
said
if
he
thought
that
you
had
made
out
a
case
for
beneficial
ownership
in
any
of
these
proceeds.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
your
brokers
in
new
york
really
should
be
recognized
as
the
beneficial
owners,
because
they
had
already
paid
their
customers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
not
owe...
and
those
funds
that
are
owed
to
you,
you
would
not
owe
to
somebody
else
because
you'd
already
paid
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
the
parties
urged
that,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
44
states
now
agree
that
he
resolved
that
issue
satisfactorily.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
just
a
particular
date
of
a
particular
year
that
property
becomes
escheatable?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
how
much
total
money
is
at
issue--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
new
york
has
to
disgorge?
is
there
any
notion
of
what
the
size
of
the
disgorgement
will
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
its
roughly...
it's
been
at
least
$100
million
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
delaware,
comparing
the
two
tests?
