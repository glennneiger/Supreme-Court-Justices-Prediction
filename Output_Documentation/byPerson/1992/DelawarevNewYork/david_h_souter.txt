mr.
lyons,
before...
i'm
sorry,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
before
you
go
on
to
that
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
one
question
that
relates
to
your
first
point.
the
brief
points
out
that
some
44
states
have
joined
into
an
unclaimed
property
clearinghouse
scheme.
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
that
scheme
could
not
be
converted
readily
to
the
court's
new
rule
of
looking
to
the
state
of
the
issuer
rather
than
to
the
state
of
the
holder
if,
in
fact,
we
follow
the
master?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
adopt
that
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in--
--prove
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
won't
that
simply
get
you
in
most
instances
to
yet
another
holder?
that
isn't
going
to
get
you
to
an
issuer,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
follow
your
process
and
you
get
to
the
now
hidden
set
of
books,
they're
going
to...
or
follow
the
books
and
you
get
yourself
to
a
hidden
entity,
that
entity
is
simply
going
to
be
another
holder,
isn't
it,
it's
not
going
to
be
the
issuer
in
many
cases?
it's
going
to
get
to
another
person
like
the
broker
in
delaware.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
don't
know,
whether
we
follow
your
theory
or
whether
we
follow
the
theory
that
delaware
wants,
but
the
fact
is,
we
have
no
more
reason
to
believe
that
following
your
theory
is
going
to
result
in
a
more
ultimate
equity
than
if
we
simply
stop
where
delaware
would
have
us
stop.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
claim
to
the
master
that
if
you
were
allowed
this
discovery
you
had
any
hope
of
proving
that
you
would
be
closer
to
the
real
beneficial
owner
if
you
were
allowed
to
follow
your
statistical
analysis
for
the
purposes
of
the
primary
rule?
