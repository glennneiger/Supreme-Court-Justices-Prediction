justice
david
h.
souter
well,
on
your
reading
of
imbler,
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
prosecutor
who
would
retain
absolute
immunity
for
what
he
introduced
in
the
course
of
the
trial
would
be
one
who
had
had
no
role
whatsoever
in
supervising
the
gathering
of
evidence.
it
would
have
to
be
the
prosecutor
who
arrived
at
the
courthouse
on
the
day
or
trial
and
said
to
his
witnesses,
well,
what
have
you
got.
justice
david
h.
souter
he'd
have
an
imbler
immunity,
but
i
don't
see
how
anyone
else
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
mean,
are
you
thinking
of
something
as
basic
as
whether
the
prosecutor
gets
in
on
the
investigation
the
day
after
the
murder
or
only
1
week
before
trial?
i
mean,
are
you
suggesting
a
distinction
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
and
ask
this
question?
i
take
it
then
in
any
case
on
your
view,
there
will
always
be
the
possibility
of
a
claim
and,
hence,
i
presume
an
evidentiary
trial
when...
against
a
prosecutor
whenever
there
is
a
claim
that
there
was
manufactured
evidence
or
perjured
testimony
or
whatnot
that
he
knew
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
how
are
we
going
to
find
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say,
gosh,
he
knew
right
from
day
one
and
he
says,
no,
i
didn't.
so,
we're
going
to
have
a
trial,
aren't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
there
was
perjured
testimony.
let's
assume
you've
got
proof
of
that.
you're...
as
a
practical
matter,
you're
always
going
to
have
a
trial
as
to
when
the
prosecutor
knew
or
should
have
known.
well,
strike
that.
you're
always
going
to
have
a
trial
about
when
the
prosecutor
knew.
by
the
time
you're
through
having
those
trials,
there's
not
going
to
be
much
left
of
imbler,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
agree
i
take
it
that
your
case
is
a
lot
stronger
with
respect
to
the...
your
argument
is
a
lot
stronger
with
respect
to
the
press
conference
than
it
is
with
respect
to
the
manufacturing
of
evidence
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
just
going
to
say
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
the
defendant
had
been
working
for
the
prosecutor
and
the
prosecutor
fired
him
and
then
gave
a
press
conference,
there
might
be
section
1983
liability,
but
if
that
were
not
the
case
and
the
prosecutor
just
libeled
him
and
somebody
else
fired
him,
you
would
not
concede
that
it
was
1983
liability.
