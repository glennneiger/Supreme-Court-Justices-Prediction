mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
conformance
with
common
law
that
absolute
immunity
to
public
officials
is
exceedingly
rare
under
section
1983.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
prosecutors
who
direct
and
participate
in
a
yearlong
prearrest
and
preindictment
investigation,
who
participate
in
manufacturing
bootprint
evidence,
in
interrogating
witnesses,
and
in
conducting
a
prejudicial
publicity
campaign,
which
includes
a
postindictment
press
conference
which
strayed
far
beyond
the
announcement
of
that
particular
indictment,
whether
those
particular
functions
and
acts
by
a
prosecutor
should
be
afforded
such
immunity.
common
law,
public
policy,
and
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
imbler,
in
burns,
and
also
in
harlow
particularly
dictate
that
such
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity
should
not
be
afforded
for
these
particular
acts
of
these
respondents.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
no.
we
have
raised
the
question
in
a
final
point
in
our
briefs
in
terms
of
limiting
imbler,
but
that
only
goes
to
the
malicious
prosecution
aspect
of
our
case.
in
terms
of
the
acts
that
i
just
outlined,
it
would
not
in
any
way
cause
a
limitation
on
the
holding
in
imbler.
common
law,
with
regard
to
this
particular
set
of
acts
and
prosecutors
and
quasi-judicial
immunity
does
not
support
the
grant
of
absolute
immunity
here.
you
can
take
it
as
narrowly
or
as
broadly
as
one
might
want
to.
narrowly,
you
look
at
these
acts
and
you
see
whether
common
law
prior
to
and
at
1871,
which
is,
of
course,
when
the
statute
was
passed,
when
we
have
to
look
at
it,
that
there
was
no
exception
for
prosecutors
or
anyone
else
for
these
kinds
of
acts.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
not
a
cause
of
action,
but
in
terms
of
the
allegations
here,
in
terms
of
false
arrest,
malicious
prosecution,
yes,
there
definitely
were.
and
that's
what
i
mean
in
terms
of
as
broadly
or
as
narrowly.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
no.
we're
not
saying
that
the
act
of
prosecuting.
we're
saying
if
you
look
at
this
as
disparate...
if
you
look
at
the
function
of
the
acts
that
are
in
question
here--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--that's
true
in
some
ways,
but
on
the
other
sense
of
it,
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
fabricated
and
then
is
introduced
later
time
into
this
judicial
process
and
causes
injury
should
not
be
determinative
of
whether
there's
immunity
because--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--that's
where
the
harm...
that's
where
the
injury
takes
place,
but
that
isn't
the
analysis
that
necessarily
follows
in
terms
of
determining
whether
the
function
that
the
particular
police
officer
or
the
function
that
the
particular
prosecutor
did
in
order
to
lead
you
to
that
introduction.
there
is
a
distinction
that
can
be
made
and
should
be
made
between
the
act
and
has
been
made
both
in
imbler
and
subsequently
in
burns
between
certain
acts
that
a
prosecutor
commits
which
are
outside
that
penumbra
of
acts
which
are
covered
by
prosecutorial
immunity
because
they
are
not
integrally
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
and
so,
in
that
sense,
we're
dealing
not
only
with
common
law,
but
we're
dealing
with
the
holdings
in
imbler,
as
well
as
policy
considerations
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
these
particular
acts
are
not
the
kinds
of
acts
that
were
either
covered
under
common
law,
are
supported
either
by
the
policy
of
1983
or
the
policy
to
protect
prosecutors
for
those
acts
that
are
intimately
associated--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
the
government--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
the
government
raised
that
in
its
amicus
for
the
first
time.
it
has
never...
and
only
as
to
the
narrow
question
of
the
press
conference
and
whether
the
press
conference
and
the
claim
that
flows
or
claims
that
flow
from
the
press
conference,
in
fact,
raise
a
constitutional-claim.
the
respondents
have
never
raised
it
and,
in
fact,
concede
in
their
brief
that
there
is
a
constitutional
claim
here,
a
fair
trial
claim.
there
has
been
no
question
with
regard
to
any
of
the
other
allegations,
whether
in
fact
there
are
constitutional
claims.
nobody--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--for
qualified
immunity,
it
becomes
a
much
closer
question
as
the
siegert
case
raises
because
to
decide
whether
a
claim
is
clearly
established,
you
have
to
decide
whether
there's
a
claim
in
terms
of
a
constitutional
violation.
here
they
are
separate
issues.
the
defendant
doesn't
raise
it.
if
it
isn't
pressed
and
passed
upon
below,
if,
in
fact,
they
concede
it,
as
they
do
here,
i
don't
think
it's
within
the
court's
purview
to
take
it
on.
however,
if
it
does,
we're
confident
that
the
court
would
find
that
we
do...
have
made
several
interrelated
claims
not
only
with
regard
to
the
investigative
acts,
such
as
the
fabrication
of
the
bootprint
evidence
and
the
coercive
statements,
but
also
with
regard
to
the
prejudicial
publicity
claim
that
the
government
has
challenged.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
it
was
raised
in
the
state
criminal
trial
on
a
motion
for
change
of
venue,
among
other
things.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
it's
interesting.
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
resolved
against
the
defendant.
in
subsequent
cases
when
his
codefendants
were
retried,
venue
was
shifted,
which
is--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--it
was.
it
was...
but--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
so
because
the
question
here,
we're
dealing
with
both
a
substantive
and
a
procedural
due
process
violation.
insofar
as
you're
dealing
with
a
procedural
due
process
violation
in
a
fair
trial
determination,
i
suppose
that's
a
similar
kind
of
question
as
to
whether
parratt
v.
taylor
applies,
which
the
government
has
also
raised.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
apply
parratt
v.
taylor
here
when
it
is
a
state
action
and
it
is
action
by
responsible
officials,
including
someone
who
has
conceded
to
be
a
policymaker
for
the
county
who
is
committing
those
acts.
in
other
words,
he's
subverting
the
due
process.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
no.
i
don't
believe
so.
by
the
determination
of
the
venue?
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
no,
because
the
nature
of
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
process
was
infected
by
the
publicity
so
that,
therefore,
the...
what
the...
what
he
was
deprived
of,
among
other
things,
was
an
impartial
decisionmaker.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
i...
you
know,
not
being
totally
familiar
with
the
change
of
venue
motion
and
the
record
on
that,
i
can't
say
for
sure,
but
if
in
fact
the
venue
motion
was
denied,
he
himself...
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
process
including
the
judge
was
influenced
by
the
prejudice
and,
therefore,
both
in
the
bond
hearing
and
in
the
trial
situation
so
that,
therefore,
the
effect...
and
you
have
to
take
our
allegations
as
true
at
this
point
that
the
publicity
infected
the
process,
so
that
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
res
judicata
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
a
fair
trial.
the
judge
determined
as
an
initial--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--true.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
that's--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--that's
true,
and
in
this
case,
i
mean,
i
want
to
make
a
distinction,
as
i
did
earlier,
between
the
claims
that
underlie
all
but
the
publicity.
and
then
as
we
focus
on
the
publicity,
however,
our
claim
does
include
that
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
or...
particularly
liberty,
3
years
of
liberty.
it
is
a
substantive
due
process
claim
in
the
sense
that
it's
arbitrary
governmental
action
in
the
actions
of
the
prosecutors
that,
in
fact,
regardless
of
the
procedures,
i.e.,
the
fair
trial--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--no.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
under
those--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
at
trial.
at...
what
if
he
takes
that
and
goes
with
his
police
associates
and
goes
and
gets
an
arrest
warrant
and
arrests
my
client?
then
the
injury
starts
to
accrue
at
that
point.
should
there
be
any
difference
in
terms
of
the
act
that
he
performs
in
filing
that
down
if
he
goes
and
gets
an
arrest
warrant,
or
if
he
goes
to
a
grand
jury
and
indicts,
or
if
he
gives
it
to
another
prosecutor
and
says,
here,
put
this
into
evidence,
or
if
it's
a
police
officer,
he
carries
it
over
and
he
then
gives
it
to
the
prosecutor?
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
the
prosecutor
then
puts
it
into
the
process.
my
man
gets
3
years
in
jail.
in
that
situation,
the
police
officer
clearly
under
malley
doesn't
have
the
absolute
immunity
and
shouldn't
have
because
of
what
he
has
performed.
if
that's
a
prosecutor
and
we
now
make
a
clean
distinction
between
that
prosecutor
and
the
one
who
introduces
it,
then
in
fact,
that
prosecutor
should
be
treated
like
the
police
officer.
that's
what
imbler
is
all
about.
that's
what
burns
is
all
about,
and
that's...
with
the
imposition
of
harlow
and
the
progeny
with
anderson
and
davis
and
all
the
protections
that
that
prosecutor
now
has
that
he
didn't
have
back
when
imbler
was
decided
for
qualified
immunity,
yes,
that
prosecutor
has
participated
in
a
consitutional
violation
that
is
a...
that
should
be
remedied
with
him
as
one
of
the
participating
defendants.
and
he
shouldn't
be
allowed
immunity
for
that
particular
act.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
with...
are
you
focusing
now
on--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--false
arrest
without
probable
cause
in
this
case,
continued
false
imprisonment
without
probable
cause,
which
is
a...
changes
then
from
a
fourth
amendment
violation
to
a
substantive
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
and
then
as
it
continues
onward
and
the
publicity
comes
in,
you
have
a
continuation
of
the
substantive
due
process
claim,
as
well
as
a
fair
trial
claim.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
it's
the
claim
of
the
3
years
of
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
by
the
arbitrary
acts
of
government
officials.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
because
even
if
you
were
given
procedures
here,
if
someone
does
a
good
job...
a
good
enough
job
of
manufacturing
evidence,
it's
such
an
arbitrary
and
shocks-the-conscience
type
of
activity
that
regardless
of
whether
you
have
the
procedures
or
not,
there's
going
to
be
a
violation
if
there
is
a
substantial
violation
of
liberty
interest--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
i'm
talking
about
rouchon.
i'm
talking
about--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
if
you
look
at
zinneman
v.
birch,
if
you
carry
it
through
to
that
point
and
you
carry
daniels
v.
williams,
they
all
set
forward...
forth
that
liberty
interest
as
a
substantive
due
process
interest.
but
it
is
also
a
procedural
due
process
interest,
and
it's
also
a
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
arrest,
specifically,
interest
because
there's
no
probable
cause,
that
the
probable
cause
was
fabricated
by
the
investigative
acts
of
the
prosecutor.
i
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
determining
by
the
injury
and
working
backwards
and
saying,
well,
if
the
injury
happened
in
the
judicial
process,
ipso
facto,
no
liability
for
the
prosecutor,
in
fact,
broadly
extended
prosecutorial
immunity,
and
was
equating...
if
we
look
now
at
the
substance
of
the
test
that's
found
in
imbler,
which
is
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
say,
well,
if
it
flowed
from
injury
in
the
judicial
process,
then
ipso
facto,
it's
an
act...
it
came
from
an
act
that
was
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
no,
that's
not--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--no,
that's
not
our
position
as
to
the
major
acts
in
this
case.
we
did
take
the
position
that,
based
on
common
law
and
the
concurrence
of
justice
scalia
in
burns,
that
imbler
could...
should
be
limited.
but
that
isn't
crucial
to
the
acts
that
i
laid
out.
those
acts
you
turn
to
and
look
at
the
nature
of
those,
and
there
are
four
or
five...
put
flesh...
four
or
five
things
that
put
flesh
on
that
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
you
look
at
timeliness.
you
look
at
how
far
removed
it
is
in
time
from
either
the
arrest
or
the
indictment.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
i'm
suggesting
that's
one
of
several
factors
that
the
courts,
and
particularly
this
court,
has
looked
at
in
suggesting
when
the
act
is
one
which
is
to
be
covered
by
prosecutorial
immunity
or
not.
other
factors
are
such
as
how
actively...
was
it
a
obtaining
of
evidence.
was
it
going
out
and
getting
that
evidence,
or
was
it
evaluating
evidence?
was
it,
in
fact...
i
think
justice
stevens
in
the
hampton
decision,
while
he
was
still
in
the
seventh
circuit,
noted
that
the
distinction
which
was
later
accepted
or
at
least
referred
to
in
the
footnote
in
imbler
which
was
that
preparation
of
perjured
testimony,
in
distinction
to
what
imbler
talked
about,
which
was
presentation
of
perjured
testimony
or
manufactured
evidence,
that
there
can
be
a
distinction
there,
that
we're--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
i
can't
just
say
that.
i
have
to
have
some
proof,
and
that's
what
butz
talks
about
not
playing
dog
in
the
manger
and
then
you
also
have--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
you're
not
going
to
have
to
have
a
trial
if,
in
fact,
the
prosecutor...
you
can't
show
on
summary
judgment
that,
in
fact,
he
participated
in
an
earlier
stage
in
manufacturing
this
evidence
rather
than
simply
putting
on
evidence
like
in
imbler
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
was
either
materially...
in
imbler,
they
don't
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
he
knew
it
was
perjured
testimony.
they
said
perhaps
the
police
officer
in
the
courtroom
might
have
known
that
it
was...
i
don't
even
think
they
used
perjured.
they
use
the
terms
of
it
was
materially
false
in
some
manner
or
inconsistent.
i
mean,
that's
a
far
different
situation
than
a
situation
here
where
the
prosecutor
is
out
in
the
field,
and
he
is
actively
manufacturing
this
bootprint
evidence,
and
he's
interrogating
witnesses,
and
he's
getting
these
witnesses
to
say
certain
things.
that
is
a...
that's
a
police
function.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
there
are
three
claims.
as
far
as
the
interrogation
of
witnesses,
the
respondents
have
conceded
that
that's
not
judicial...
that's
not
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase.
as
far
as
the
prejudicial
publicity,
the
press
conference,
the
government
has
conceded
that
that's
not
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
so,
two
out
of
the
three
major
aspects
of
the
case
have
been
conceded
by
the
other
side.
now--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--the
third
is
the
manufacture
of
the
bootprint
evidence.
now,
what
the
respondents
say
is,
of
course,
if
that
were
planting
evidence
rather
than
the
manufacture
of
evidence,
then
they
would
agree
with
us
that
that
is
not
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase.
now,
i...
to
me
that
that
kind
of
manufacture
of
evidence
is
very
close
to
the
planting
of
evidence.
and
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
burns,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
that
this
court
found
in
burns,
what
the
prosecutor
there
did,
he
wasn't
involved
in
the
taking
of
a
hypnotic
statement,
but
he
advised
that
they
could
do
that.
he
was
one
step
removed
even
from
the
combination
of
the
interrogation
of
that
particular
suspect
and
the
manufacture
of
some
hypnotic
evidence
which
he
then
turned
and
introduced
into
two
criminal
proceedings.
and
it
was
only
in
the
final
criminal
proceeding
which
was...
they
were
successful
in,
the
motion
to
suppress,
that
she
was
let
out
after
4
years...
excuse
me...
4
months
in...
i
think
they
had
committed
her
to
a
mental
hospital...
out
of
her
incarceration.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
if
you
put
it
that
way,
if
you
say
don't
depend
at
all,
in
the
sense
of
that
wasn't
a
necessary...
the
way
these
prosecutors
chose
to
approach
it,
they
didn't
go
out
like
in
burns
and
get
an
arrest
warrant
and
arrest
first
and
then
indict
or
charge.
they
did
it
the
opposite
way.
and
in
that
sense,
it's
different,
but
it
shouldn't
be
a
difference
with
a
distinction
because,
in
fact--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
other
than
the
out-of-court
publicity,
but
that
we
concede
in
of
itself--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--is
not
a
constitutional
violation.
so,
in
that
sense,
there
is
some...
all
the
injury
either
in
part...
is...
or
in
toto
is
caused
by
its
introduction
into
the
judicial
process.
but
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
if
the
rationale
extended,
then
we
were
talking
about...
if
a
police
officer
manufactures
that
evidence
and
a
prosecutor
introduces
it
at
trial
and
causes
the
kind
of
violation
that
we
have
here,
a
series
of
violations,
then
by
the
logic,
then
he
should
be
immune
as
well.
if
a...
if
we're
dealing
with
the
act
and
not
the
actor,
we
have
to
deal
with
what
that
particular
person
did
and
whether
it's
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
and,
in
fact,
here
it's
not.
it's
clearly
not
by...
i
started
to
lay
out
some
of
the
factors
i
would
look
at
and
that
the
court
said
in
the
past
they
should
look
at
in
terms
of
determining
that,
you
know,
well,
it
looks
like
it,
it
smells
like,
that
kind
of
thing,
it
must
be
it.
some
of
those
others,
was
he
acting
as
an
advocate?
was
he
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
court?
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
that's
a
closer
question.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
if
he
knows
it's...
under
imbler,
the
answer
would
be
no.
i'm
sorry.
the
answer
would
be
yes
because
he
presented...
he
knowingly
presented
false
testimony.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
under
imbler
he
would
be.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
under
burns
as
well
because
that's
an
act
in
front
of
the
judicial
body.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
quite
a
bit
of
difference
in
terms
of
the
activeness
of
what
you
do.
i
mean,
if
you
limit...
if
you
think
of
what
the
holding
in
imbler
is
and
you
go
back
to
the
common
law
and
you
se
that
it's
primarily
premised
on
the
defamation
immunity,
which
is
what
happens
in
court,
then
once
it
gets
farther
and
farther
away
from
court,
the
action
is
less
and
less
entitled
to
immunity.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
under
imbler,
yes.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
under
imbler,
if
you're
going
to
say
he's
immune,
you'd
have
to
say
no,
but
if
the
act
is
different
than
the
mere
presentation,
if
in
fact
it's
the
act
of
acquiring
it
or
manufacturing
of
it,
that
is
a
distinction.
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
for
that
prosecutor
who
got
the
indictment
now.
i
don't
mean
for
someone
else
who
may
have
manufactured
that
evidence--
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
--whether
he
be
a
police
officer
or
prosecutor.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
when
the
question
of
two
prosecutors,
or
police
doing
the
act
rather
than
the
prosecutor,
comes
up
in
both
of
the
contexts
of
both
the
manufacture
of
the
evidence,
the
interrogation
of
the
witnesses,
and
the
prejudicial
publicity,
we
see
the
basic
fallacy
of
their
argument
because
what
they're
doing
here
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
doing
is...
has
a
premise
and
a
principle
which
extends
prosecutorial
immunity
to
all
those
kinds
of
actions.
and
that
is
the
premise
that's
faulty
here.
now,
the
court
of
appeals...
he
says
that
he...
excuse
me...
the
government
says
that
they
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
part.
well,
they
can't
agree
with
it
in
part
in
terms
of
the
injury
analysis.
they're
saying
that
they're
conceding
that
it's
only
qualified
immunity
for
the
press
conference.
well,
but
they're
saying
that
it's
absolute
immunity
with
regard
to
the
other,
the
manufacture
of
evidence.
well,
both
of
those
are
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
injury
happened
within
the
judicial
process.
that's
what
judge
easterbrook
premised
his
analysis
on.
so,
if
you...
you
have
to
see
absolute
immunity
for
both
or
absolute
immunity
for
neither.
the
government's
argument
is
completely
inconsistent
on
that
position.
and
it
also
shows
the
basic
mistake
of
that
court
of
appeals
decision,
that
its
overreaching
nature
of
looking
at
the
injury
rather
than
the
act.
and
that
is
the
basic
mistake
of
that
decision,
and
that's
how
it
distorts
imbler
and
allows
one
to
ignore
the
holding
there
which
the...
is
that
the
act
has
to
be
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
in
error
and
that,
in
fact,
qualified
immunity
should
be
afforded
here
rather
than
absolute
immunity.
mr.
george
f.
taylor,
jr.
that's
not
the
way
they
stated
it
in
the
brief.
they
stated
it
in
an
absolute
way
both
in
their
summary
of
argument
and
in
their
argument
itself
that
it's
not
a
question
of
absolute
immunity,
and
i
think
they
say
specifically
that
it's
because
it's
not
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
and
so,
in
that
sense,
that
concession...
they
may
not...
they
may
have
backed
up
from
it
a
bit
after
we
filed
our
reply
brief,
but
it
is
clear
what
that
concession
entails
in
the...
in
their
original
amicus
brief.
and
i...
their
statement
that
it
was
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
is...
borders
on
the
ridiculous.
if
you
go
and
look
at
those
pages,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
far
as
it
extended
immunity,
was
not
dealing
with
constitutional
violations.
it
was
never
an
issue.
the
defendants
have
never
raised
it.
they
have...
they
still
concede
that,
in
fact,
there
were
constitutional
violations
alleged
here.
the
court
did
not
need
to
reach
it.
it
wasn't
briefed,
and
it
wasn't
argued,
and
it
wasn't
decided.
and
if
you
look
most
recently
at
this
court's
decision
in
bray
v.
alexandria,
it
was
a
very
similar
situation
where
the
respondent
wanted
to
argue
an
additional
claim
on
reargument
i
believe,
and
this
court
rejected
that
because
of
those
factors.
thank
you
very
much.
