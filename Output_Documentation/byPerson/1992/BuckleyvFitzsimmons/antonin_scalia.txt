there
was
also
no
cause
of
action.
was
there
a
cause
of
action
at
common
law
for
fabricating
evidence
that
is
never
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait.
the
malicious
prosecution
certainly
is...
you're
not
saying
that
the
act
of
prosecuting
is
not
covered
by
the
immunity,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
that
if
you
take
them
apart,
there
isn't
any
liability
if...
unless
it
leads
up
to
the
prosecution.
the
mere
fact
that
you
fabricate
a
piece
of
evidence
which
is
never
used
in
a
prosecution...
there's
no
harm
done,
is
there?
i
can
fabricate
as
much
evidence
as
i
want
if
it's
never
used
in
a
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
the
introduction
that
causes
the
harm.
the
point
at
which
your
client
is
harmed
is
when
fabricated
evidence
is
introduced
against
him
at
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taylor,
you're
not
entitled
to
process...
to
fair
process
and
you're
not
entitled
to
a
fair
trial.
you
are
entitled
not
to
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
a
fair
trial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
without
due
process.
and
what
this
decision
held
was
that
there
was
no
effect
on
the
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
you
had
not
been
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process.
it
seems
to
me
you're
trying
to
convert
the
constitutional
guarantee
into
a
guarantee
that
in
the
abstract,
all
processes
will
be
fair,
and
that's
not
what
the
guarantee
is.
the
guarantee
is
that
your
client
won't
be
sent
to
jail
or
be
deprived
of
property
or
life--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
basis
of
unfair
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
separate
from
the
trial
you
claim
so
that
there's
no
absolute
immunity.
let's
assume
a
prosecutor
decides
he
is
going
to
fabricate
evidence.
he
files
the
firing
pin
on
a
pistol
so
that
it
makes
the
kind
of
a...
of
an
imprint
on
the
shell
that
the
murder
weapon
made.
all
right?
he
does
that
at
home.
he
never
introduces
it
at
trial.
does
your
client
have
a
claim?
has
there
been
any
harm
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
claim
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
fabricate
as
much
evidence
as
he
likes.
it's
the
introduction
of
it
at
trial,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taylor?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
claim
that
you
make...
or
let
me
put
it
another
way.
what
claims
do
you
make
that
do
not
depend
at
all
on
the
respondents'
decision
to
indict
or
on
respondents'
presentation
of
evidence
in
judicial
proceedings
either
for
bail
or
at
the
grand
jury
or
at
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
answer
is
none.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
not
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sotos,
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between,
case
one,
the
prosecutor
fabricates
evidence
by
filing
the
firing
pin
on
the
pistol
and
it
gets...
and
then
he
introduces
it;
case
two,
it
isn't
the
prosecutor
that
does
it?
you'd
say
in
case
one
that
he's
immune.
there's
absolute
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
case
two,
it
isn't
the
prosecutor
that
does
it.
it's
the
arresting
officer.
he
has
a
grudge
against
the
defendant.
so,
he
fabricates
it.
the
prosecutor,
either
way,
either
innocently
or
knowing
of
the
fabrication,
introduces
it.
is
the
arresting
officer
immune?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
there
are
two
acts.
there's
the
act
of
introduction,
and
there's
the
act
of
fabrication.
just
as
you
can
get
the
arresting
officer
separately
for
that
separate
act,
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
get
the
prosecutor
separately
for
that
separate
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
taylor,
i
thought
that
the
concession
of
qualified
immunity
liability
with
respect
to
the
press
conference
was
a
concession
of
qualified
immunity
as
to
injuries
other
than
the
injuries
that
are
produced
through
the
trial,
that
is,
qualified
immunity
for
any
libel.
