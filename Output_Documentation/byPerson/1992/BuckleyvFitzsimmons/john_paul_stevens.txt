justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
the
press
conference?
i
mean,
isn't
the
claim
that
the
press
conference
itself
generated
some
of
the
prejudice
that
supported
the
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
it
isn't
just
his
opposing
the
motion.
it's
his
creating
the
grounds
for
the
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
other
point?
if
the
press
conference
had
been
conducted
by
the
chief
of
police
and
the
same
damage
claim
were
made,
you'd
agree
only
qualified
immunity
in
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
would
think
in
terms
of
what
the
prosecutor
decides
later,
i
assume
probably
that
the
police
chief
would
be
indemnified
by
the
county
and
he'd
also...
to
the
extent
your
argument
is
valid,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
influence
his
prosecutorial
decision
in
the
same
way
because
the
damage
liability...
technically
it's
against
one
officer
rather
than
the
other,
but
i
guess
his
real
client
would
pay
the
bill
in
either
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
the...
what
if
it
was
an
assistant
prosecutor
who
did
not
thereafter
participate
in
the
trial?
does
he
get
qualified
immunity
or
absolute
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
had
a
lawyer
who
did
a
lot
of
press
relations
work
and
made
all
the
public
announcements
and
so
forth,
but
very
rarely
participated
in
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
immunity
or...
qualified
immunity
or
absolute
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
would
be
governed
by
our
decision
in
the
case
is
why
i'm
curious
about
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
could
have...
i
mean,
i
think
maybe
even
in
this
case
you
have
a
change
of...
some
new
prosecutor
is
elected.
prosecutor
a
made
the
press
conference.
prosecutor
b
is
the
one
who
went
ahead
and
made
the
decisions.
are
both
a...
that's
not,
it
seems
to
me,
so
unreasonable
to
have
that
happen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
concerned
about
prosecutor
b
being
the
one
who
has
to
resist
the
motion
for
change
of
venue.
he's
the
one
whom
you
say
would
be
influenced
by
potential
liability.
and
my
question
is
what
if
a
had
the
press
conference
and
b
takes
over
thereafter
and
resists
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you'd
say
a
is
immune
even
though
actually
b
is
the
one
who
actually
makes
the
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
even
if
the...
if
it
had
been
a
police
officer
who
fabricated
evidence
and
all
the
rest,
there
would
be
no
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
your
argument,
on
its
face
the
procedures
are
all
fair
so
that
the
fact
that
fabricated
evidence
was
used
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
insofar
as
there's
a
procedural
due
process
claim,
and
it
wouldn't
matter
then
whether
it
was
a
prosecutor
or
a
police
officer
who
fabricated
the
evidence.
