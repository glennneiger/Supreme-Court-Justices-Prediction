v.
michael
fitzsimmons.
mr.
taylor,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taylor,
does
acceptance...
would
acceptance
of
your
position
require
that
we
cut
back
at
all
on
the
opinion...
on
our
decision
in
the
imbler
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
precisely
the
issue
that
the
judge
determined
against
you
in
the
criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
what
precisely
is
the
constitutional
violation
in
which
he
has
participated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
you
said
he
has
participated
in
a
constitutional
violation.
i'm
asking
you
what
you
meant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
substantive
due
process
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
that
a
procedural
due
process
claim,
that
you
were
deprived
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
the
rouchon
against
california
ball
park
that
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
rather
small
ball
park.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
taylor.
mr.
sotos,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sotos.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
was
this
point
raised
by
the
respondents
in
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
the
lower
courts
have
passed
on
this
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
respondent
rely
on
it
in
its
brief...
his
brief
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
taylor,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice

case
