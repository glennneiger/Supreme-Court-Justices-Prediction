justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
in
the
case
of
manufactured
evidence
an
indictment
is
secured...
or
fabricated
evidence,
and
the
prosecutor,
knowing
the
evidence
is
fabricated,
then
announces
to
the
public
how
strong
the
evidence
is.
and
as
a
result,
the
defendant
is
fired
from
his
job,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
only
qualified
immunity
if
the
prosecutor
gives
a
press
conference
outlining
the
evidence
after
there's
an
indictment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
support
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
mr.
sotos'
conclusion
that
there
would
be
only
qualified
immunity
if,
say,
the
person
lost
his
job
and
that
was
the
injury
from
the
fabricated
evidence?
say
the
prosecutor
announced
he's
going
to
go
ahead
with
the
indictment
and
the
trial
because
of
the
strength
of
the
evidence
and
the
person
loses
his
job.
my
understanding
mr.
sotos'
analysis
was
that
in
that
case,
there's
only
qualified
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
--i
take
it
you
also
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit's
analysis
in
this
case?
