mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
petitioner's
contention
that
the
prosecutors
are
subject
to
a
section
1983
damages
action
based
on
the
preindictment
activities,
such
as
evaluation
of
the
evidence
and
selection
of
expert
witnesses.
this
court's
decision
in
imbler
squarely
holds
that
a
prosecutor
is
immune
for
actions
taken
in
initiating
a
prosecution
and
in
presenting
the
state's
case.
the
prosecutor's
preindictment
actions
in
evaluating
the
evidence
is
part
of
that
process.
indeed,
his
evaluation
is
an
essential
step
in
determining
whether
to
bring
a
prosecution.
it
follows
that
a
prosecutor
cannot
be
sued
on
the
basis
of
his
review
of
the
evidence
and
selection
of
expert
witnesses
where
the
only
injury
the
plaintiff
alleges
is
the
commencement
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
at
bottom,
the
issue
here
does
not
differ
at
all,
or
at
least
in
no
significant
respect,
from
the
issue
in
imbler.
the
petitioner
seeks
damages
for
what
he
alleges
was
a
wrongful
prosecution.
petitioner
attempts
to
distinguish
his
suit
by
characterizing
his
claim
as
a
challenge
to
the
prosecutor's
investigation,
but
he
does
not
allege
that
this
investigation
injured
him
in
any
way
apart
from
what
happened
in
court.
imbler,
accordingly,
bars
his
claim.
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it,
it
would
be
a
hoax
to
proclaim
immunity
for
presentation
of
testimony.
in
court
the
person
aggrieved
by
that
testimony
may
attack
its
preparation.
immunity
is
not
limited
to
unprepared
events
at
trial.
yet,
that
is
exactly
the
result
that
petitioner
urges
here.
indeed,
the
plaintiff
in
imbler
made
very
similar
claims
with
respect
to
the
prosecutor's
preparation
of
his
case
in
that
particular
instance.
this
court,
nevertheless,
held
that
the
prosecutor
was
immune
in
imbler.
the
court
of
appeals
was
also
correct
in
concluding
that
the
former
prosecutor
fitzsimmons
is
not
subject
to
suit
for
his
out-of-court
public
statements
that
allegedly
injured
petitioner
in
the
subsequent
criminal
proceedings.
we
will
not
characterize
that
issue,
however,
as
a
matter
of
absolute
immunity.
petitioner's
suit
is
defective
because
it
fails
to
state
a
cognizable
section
1983
claim.
taking
petitioner's
factual
allegations
as
true,
fitzsimmons'
public
statements
did
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
deprive
petitioner
of
any
constitutional
right.
first--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
don't
know
if
it
was
raised
specifically
by
the
respondents
in
the
lower
courts,
but
the
courts
below
both
said
that
it
is
a
necessary
consideration
whether
there
is
an
actionable
harm,
that
that
is
a
subsidiary
issue
in
determining
the
question
of
immunity.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--they
passed
on
it,
and
i
would
point
to
pages
89
and
90
of
the
court...
first
court
of
appeals
opinion,
pages
105,
106,
and
108
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
don't
believe
that
he
relied
on
it
specifically,
but
again,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
characterization
of
the
argument
here.
in
essence,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
absolute...
absolute
immunity
applies
here
because
there
was
no
cause
of
action
without
the
mediation
of
a
judge.
we
think
that
it's
wrong
to
call
that
a
question
of
absolute
immunity.
what
the
gist
of
that
argument
really
is
there's
no
constitutional
injury
here
unless
the
complaint
also
challenges
the
judicial
decision
that
was
made
in
this
case
and
takes
into
account
the
procedures
that
are
available
to
prevent
a
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
agree
with
that,
but
i
would
also
note
there's
an
underlying
question
of
whether
there
would
be
a
section
1983
cause
of
action
in
those
cases
also.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
to
the
extent
that
the
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
we
do
agree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
we
agree
with
it
in
part,
although
we
disagree
with
its
characterization
of
this
issue
as
an
issue
of
absolute
immunity.
as
i
said
before,
i
think
the
problem
here--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--with
respect
to
the
press
conference,
that's
right.
we
do
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
with
regard
to
the
preindictment
activities.
we
do
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
the
former
case
is
more
like
forrester
v.
white,
for
instance.
now,
turning
to
what
actually
happened
in
this
case,
fitzsimmons'
statements
plainly
provide
no
basis
for
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
claim
because
the
grand
jury
indicted
petitioner
prior
to
the
press
conference,
and
the
indictment
itself
provided
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
second,
fitzsimmons'
statements
cannot
support
petitioner's
defamation
claim
because,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
mere
injury
to
reputation
by
itself
does
not
amount
to
a
constitutional
injury.
with
respect
to
fitzsimmons'
statements
and
how
they
affected
the
claim
relating
to
pretrial
release,
petitioner,
to
be
sure,
has
a
liberty
interest
in
freedom
from
confinement,
but
his
interest
is
invaded
only
if
he
is
detained
without
due
process
of
law.
here
an
illinois
court
detained
petitioner
pursuant
to
illinois
bail
law,
and
petitioner
has
not
alleged
that
the
illinois
court's
bail
decision
violated
the
due
process.
in
fact,
petitioner
has
not
challenged
or
mentioned
the
adequacy
of
illinois
bail
laws
at
all.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
challenge,
petitioner
has
no
due
process
claim
against
anyone.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct
as
to
the
prosecutor.
the
question
here
again...
the
due
process...
i
take
it
your
question
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right
with
respect
to
the
due
process
claim--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--because,
again,
our
focus
here
is
on
the
procedures
that
were
used
to
deprive
him
of
liberty.
finally,
i
would
turn
to
the
claim
that
fitzsimmons'
statements
deprive
petitioner
of
a
liberty
interest
based
on
the
outcome
of
his
criminal
trial.
petitioner
was
not
convicted.
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict,
and
the
resulting
mistrial
did
not
curtail
petitioner's
liberty
interest
in
any
constitutional
sense.
in
any
event,
petitioner
again
cannot
state
a
due
process
claim
against
anyone
without
a
colorable
challenge
to
the
illinois
procedures,
such
as
voir
dire
and
change
of
venue
rules,
that
are
available
to
prevent
prejudice
from
pretrial
publicity.
petitioner
has
made
no
claim
that
the
illinois
procedures
are
defective,
and
as
a
result,
he
has
failed
to
satisfy
the
requirements
for
stating
a
due
process
claim.
in
sum,
even
if
petitioner's
allegations
are
true,
they
fail
to
state
a
section
1983
claim.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
