mr.
james
g.
sotos
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
focusing
on
the
prosecutor's
participation
in
acts
which
occurred
prior
to
the
indictment,
specifically
in
terms
of
interrogations
and
the
selection
of
expert
witnesses.
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
discussing
the
petitioner's
unfair
trial
claim
against
prosecutor
fitzsimmons
arising
from
the
announcement
of
his
criminal
indictment.
your
honors,
we
simply
ask
the
court
to
apply
a
rule
which
immunizes,
accords
absolute
immunity
to
prosecutors
who
are
accused
of
engaging
in
out-of-court
investigation
which
culminates
in
constitutional
wrongs
only
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
prosecute
and
to
present
evidence
to
judicial
bodies.
we
acknowledge
that
in
other
cases
investigative
conduct
is
amply
protected
by
the
protections
of
qualified
immunity.
we
believe
that
the
distinction
can
be
drawn
in
a
given
case,
in
particular
in
this
case,
by
simply
focusing
on
the
prosecutorial
function
to
be
inhibited
or
deterred
if
the
suit
is
allowed
to
proceed
and
immunity
is
withheld.
applying
that
test
to
this
case
reveals
quite
readily
that
the
petitioner's
claims
arising
from
the
investigation
are
solely
based
upon
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
present
testimony
to
the
grand
jury
and
again
at
the
petitioner's
criminal
trial.
he
has
conceded
that
the
only
claims
he
has
are...
occurred
as
a
result
of
those
decisions.
the
petitioner's--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--if
it
was
the
prosecutor
who
did
that?
mr.
james
g.
sotos
yes,
justice.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
the
arresting
officer
would
not
be
immune.
there
would
be
a
distinction
in
that
case.
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
prosecutor
again
has
immunity
for
the
act
of
manufacturing
the
evidence.
it
is
his
decision
to
introduce
the
evidence
into
the
process.
now,
under
this
court's
functional
approach,
it's
often
said
that
we
have
to
focus
on
the
act
and
not
the
actor.
and
that's
true,
but
it
can
be
misleading
because
the
key
to
the
functional
approach
really
is
to
focus
on
the
nature
of
the
prosecutorial
function
to
be
deterred
if
the
suit
is
allowed
to
proceed.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
because
the
prosecutor
has
to
be
protected
from
exposure
to
liability
in
that
earlier
act
to
the
extent
that
he
would
be
inhibited
in
terms
of
introducing
that
information
into
the
process.
this
court
actually
addressed
that
distinction
in
malley
where
the
police
officer
sought
to
analogize
his
position
in
seeking
an
arrest
warrant
to
a
prosecutor's
efforts
to
obtaining
a
warrant...
to
obtain
an
indictment.
this
court
specifically
rejected
that
analogy
and
stated
that
to
expose
the
prosecutor
to
liability
for
even
the
initial
phase
of
his
prosecutorial
work
could
interfere
with
his
exercise
of
independent
judgment
at
every
phase
of
his
work
so
that
the
prosecutor
might
come
to
see
later
decisions
in
terms
of
their
effect
on
his
potential
liability.
so,
again,
under
the
functional
approach,
you
look
at
the...
the
prosecutor
exercises
the
functions
that
are
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
criminal
judicial
process,
the
decision
to
prosecute,
the
decision
to
introduce
testimony.
and
to
the
extent
that
liability
on
a
claim
that
may
have
initially
arose
as
a
result
of
his
involvement
in
the
investigative
process
would
impact
on
those
decisions,
the
immunity
has
to
apply
to
that
claim
as
opposed
to
just
focusing
on
the
act.
if
you
simply
focus
on
the
preparatory
act,
then
you
run
the
risk
of
turning
imbler
into
a
pleading
rule
which
could
be
circumvented
in
every
instance
if
a
criminal
defendant
simply
focuses
on
a
preparatory
act
and
uses
that
as
the
linchpin
or
the
hook
upon
which
to
relitigate
the
criminal
prosecution,
which
we
believe
is
exactly
what's
happening
here.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
under
burns
v.
reed,
the
prosecutor
would
only
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
under
that
scenario.
that
function
of
participating
in
seeking
an
arrest
is
not
so
intimately
associated
with
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
prosecute
that
it
would
be
entitled
to
the
rarer
protection
of
absolute
immunity.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
well,
we
believe--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--we
believe
that's
the
reason
that
the
petitioner's
false
arrest
claim
should
not
be
permitted
to
circumvent
absolute
immunity.
typically
if
the
prosecutor
again
is
participating
in
seeking
an
arrest
warrant
outside
the
grand
jury,
there
would
be
no
immunity.
but
again,
under
illinois
law,
the
judiciary
is
required
to
issue
an
arrest
warrant
immediately
upon
the
return
of
an
indictment.
and
we
know
from
several
cases
that
a
prosecutor
is
absolutely
immune
for
his
actions
before
the
grand
jury.
so,
to
the
extent
that
the
false
arrest
claim
could
be
allowed
to
circumvent
immunity
in
this
case,
again
imbler
would
just
be
turned
into
a
pleading
rule
because
in
every
case
where
a
criminal
defendant
was
indicted,
he
would
simply
sue
the
prosecutor
for
false
arrest.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
claim
where
the
petitioner
was
claiming
a
deprivation
of
liberty
attributable
to
a
prosecutor's
participation
in
an
administrative
act.
so,
we
would
claim
only
the
qualified
immunity.
the
prosecutor
would
only
be
qualified
immunity
under
that
scenario.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that's
correct.
you
see,
again,
the
difference
between
that
scenario
and
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
petitioner
seeks
to
use
the
announcement
of
the
criminal
indictment
as
a
way
to
litigate
an
unfair
trial
claim.
and
it's
our
position
that
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
has
given
prosecutors
absolute
immunity
from
malicious
prosecution
claims,
regardless
of
what
the
triggering
act
is,
it's
that
claim
that
he's
immune
from
because
it
by
nature
targets
the
decision
to
indict
in
the
same
way
an
unfair
trial
claim
by
nature
targets
the
prosecutor's
conduct
of
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
because
to
properly
apply
the
functional
approach,
justice
white,
the
court
should
focus
on
the
entire
claim,
not
just
the
act
because,
again,
that
runs
the
risk
of
imbler
being
a
pleading
rule.
and
this
claim
is
two-dimensional.
there's
a
claim
that
the
press
conference
deprived
him
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
we
concede
that
with
respect
to
the
press
conference,
that
that's
an
administrative
act
for
which
the
prosecutor
would
typically
only
be
entitled
to
administrative
immunity
under
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
concerning
a
loss
of
job.
but
in
order
to
prove
this
claim,
he
has
to
show
that
he
was
deprived
of
a
fair
trial,
and
to
expose
the
prosecutor
to
an
unfair
trial
claim...
by
illustration,
if
that
prosecutor
was
wrestling
with
the
decision
of
whether
to
go
forward
and
present
the
case
to
the
jury,
if
he
was
denied
immunity
on
this
type
of
claim,
his
thinking
would
be
something
like
this.
if
i
don't
go
forward,
i
can't
be
sued
because
i
haven't
done
anything
to
this
point
to
violate
anyone's
constitutional
rights.
but
if
i
do
go
forward
with
this
case
and
i
don't
get
a
conviction
or
if
the
case
ends
in
a
hung
jury,
then
i
can
be
sued
for
deprivation
of
a
fair
trial
if
the
petitioner
uses
the
announcement
of
the
press
conference
as
the
linchpin
on
which
to
achieve
the
relitigation
of
the
criminal
case.
and,
justice,
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
more
specific
example
of
how
allowing
this
type
of
claim
to
go
forward
would
interfere
with
the--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--that
would
be
a
claim
that
would
not
circumvent
the
problems
he
would
have
with
paul
v.
davis.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
to
the
extent
that
it
was
an
immunity
analysis,
it
would
just
be
qualified
immunity.
that's
correct.
let
me
give
the
court
a
specific
example
of
how
allowing
this
press
conference
claim
or
this
unfair
trial
claim
to
go
forward
would
interfere
with
the
prosecutor's
decisions
in
the
future.
in
a
high
profile,
highly
charged
case
like
this,
a
criminal
defendant's
motion
to
transfer
venue
is
a
typical
and
a
common
occurrence
in
a
criminal
trial.
at
the
time
that
motion
is
made,
that
prosecutor
has
to
decide
whether
to
oppose
that
motion
or
to
concede
to
a
transfer
to
a
different
venue,
and
that
decision
is
supposed
to
be
made
based
upon
his
independent
evaluation
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
publicity
has
infected
the
trial
process.
if
immunity
were
withheld,
when
the
prosecutor
was
sitting
down
to
make
that
decision,
he
would
be
more
inclined
to
just
concede
to
a
transfer
because
of
a
fear
that
if
he
successfully
opposed
the
motion,
but
didn't
win
the
trial,
that
he
could
be
sued
for
deprivation
of
a
fair
trial
for
opposing
the
motion.
and
when
you
really
look
at
this
claim,
that's
what
the
petitioner
is
doing
here.
he's
suing
the
prosecutor
for
opposing
his
motion
to
transfer
venue
at
the
criminal
trial.
and
if
you
take
it
to
the
next--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--that
is
the
claim.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
but
again,
your
honor,
that
would
only
be
half
of
the
analysis.
and
the
prosecutor
would
still
be
deterred
from
making
inflammatory
announcements
of
an
indictment
because
he
is
only
entitled
to
administrative...
excuse
me...
to
qualified
immunity
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
claim.
again,
under
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
if
the
claim
was
that,
prosecutor,
by
virtue
of
the
way
in
which
you
announce
my
indictment,
i
lost
my
job,
well,
then
there
would
only
be
qualified
immunity.
but
we
have
to
protect...
under
the
functional
approach,
we
have
to
protect
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
go
forward
and
those
decisions
that
are
made
in
connection
with
the
conduct
of
the
criminal
prosecution
specifically
in
terms
of
do
i
oppose
this
motion,
do
i
concede
to
the
motion.
and
again,
ultimately
this
claim
is
really
based
upon
his
opposition
to
the
judge's
decision
to
deny
the
motion
to
change
venue.
thank
you,
judges.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
we
do
support
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit,
justice
kennedy.
we
think
that
really
what
the
seventh
circuit
was
doing
was
just
coming
up
with
a
convenient
method
of
applying
the
functional
approach,
which
is
what
we're
attempting
to
do
today.
the
seventh
circuit's
approach
helps
the
court
to
focus
on
the
function
of
the
prosecutor
that's
deterred
if
the
claim
is
allowed
to
go
forward.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
yes,
justice
stevens,
we
would
because
under
that
scenario
the
chief
doesn't
have
a
later...
he
doesn't
have...
by
statute
he
doesn't
have
the
responsibility
to
determine
whether
to
prosecute
or
whether
to
present
the
state's
case.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
that
the
chief's
exposure
would
influence
the
prosecutor's--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--decision
to
go
forward?
that's
perhaps
a
possibility,
but
again,
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere,
and
absolute
immunity
has
traditionally
been
drawn
with
the
line
that
you
focus
on
the
individual's
own
exposure.
and
the
theory
is
the--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--that
again
would
present
a
more
difficult
question.
mr.
james
g.
sotos
my
first--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--my
first
response
to
that
would
be
that
that's
a
more
difficult
question
that
isn't
presented
here.
secondly,
i--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--i
would
state
in
response
to
that
that
the
possibility
of...
i
guess,
it's
kind
of
an
investigative
prosecutor
who
didn't
have
prosecutorial
responsibility
seems
to
me
to
be
something
of
a
misnomer.
prosecutors
are
assigned
by
statute
with
the
responsibility
to
commence
and
prosecute
criminal
actions.
to
the
extent
that
a
prosecutor
would
solely
have
an
investigative
function,
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
realistic
prospect.
for
the
most
part,
prosecutors'
offices
do
hire
investigators,
but
they're
not
lawyers
who
are,
again,
assigned
by
statute
with
the
responsibility
to
prosecute
criminal
actions.
going
one
step
further,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
prosecutor
did
make
that
decision
to
prosecute,
he
would
still
be
looking
at
the...
that
decision
in
terms
of
his
office's
exposure
to
a
civil
suit.
so--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--well,
factually
prosecutor
a,
respondent
fitzsimmons,
was
responsible
for
the
decision
to
indict
and
to
initiate
the
prosecution.
it
was
later
on,
when
the
case
actually
went
to
trial--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--again,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
prosecutor's
assessment
of
the
office's
exposure
to
a
civil
lawsuit
as
a
result
of
that
trial--
mr.
james
g.
sotos
--to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
prior
prosecutor,
yes,
i
would.
