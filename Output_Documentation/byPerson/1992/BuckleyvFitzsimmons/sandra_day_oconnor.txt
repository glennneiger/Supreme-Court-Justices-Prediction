justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
have
to,
first
of
all,
decide
whether
you've
stated
a
claim
in
order
to
address
the
immunity
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
part
and
parcel
of
the
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
just
asking
you
whether,
as
a
matter
of
procedure,
when
a
claim
is
made,
whether
the
court
doesn't
have
to
first
decide
whether
a
claim
has
actually
been
stated
or
not.
don't
we
have
to
do
that
analytically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
pretrial
publicity
issue
was
raised
in
the
state
criminal
trial
ever?
was
that
raised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
that
resolved
against
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
case
it
was
decided
against.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
is
it
res
judicata
under
allen
against
mccurdy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
the
extent
that
you're
relying
on
procedural
due
process,
are
you...
is
that
not
barred
at
present?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
the
determination
of
the
pretrial
publicity
claim
made
in...
at
the
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sotos,
what
if
what
we
have
was
the
prosecutor
manufacturing
the
evidence
and
obtaining
an
arrest
warrant,
the
prosecution
is
later
dismissed,
but
the
defendant
is
arrested?
now,
what
kind
of
immunity
does
the
prosecutor
have--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
there
any
problem
in
this
case
because
of
a
peculiarity
of
the
illinois
laws
where
the
indictment
serves
also
as
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
do
about
that?
