that
still
doesn't
sound
like
a
disregard
or
carelessness
of
any
kind,
and
that's
the
meaning
of
neglect,
is
it
not?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
eleventh
circuit
reads
the
neglect
word
out
of
the
statutory
phrase,
out
of
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
you
say
reasonable,
well,
then
it's
not
carelessness.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
that
the
statute
reads
that
the
court
may
allow
the
late
filing
in
a
case
of
excusable
neglect,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
there
may
be
cases
of
excusable
neglect
in
which
it
will
and
other
cases
of
excusable
neglect
in
which
it
will
not
allow
the
late
filing?
and
isn't
it
at
that
point
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
consequences
to
third
parties,
whether
they're
getting
hurt
or
whether
they're
not
getting
hurt?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may...
that
may
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
reasons
for
the
failure
to
act
in
determining
what
is
excusable,
but
it
certainly
does
not
exclude
from
the
court's
consideration
the
consequences
to
third
parties
in
determining
whether
a...
an
excusable
neglect
should,
in
fact,
be
a
basis
for
precluding
him
and
making...
precluding
the
party
from
making
a
late
filing.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
no
discretion
at
all.
i
mean,
if
that
were
going
to
be...
if
that
were
the
intent
of
congress,
why
didn't
congress
simply
make
it
mandatory
that
if
the
neglect
was
found
to
be
excusable,
a
late
filing
would
be
permitted?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know,
and
it
seems
to
me
there's
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
they
did
not.
they
left
it
a
discretionary
judgment
or
they
left
some
further
act
of
discretion
even
when
the
neglect
was
found
to
be
excusable.
and
yet,
in
the
hypothesis
that
you
give,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
no
discretion
left
at
all.
