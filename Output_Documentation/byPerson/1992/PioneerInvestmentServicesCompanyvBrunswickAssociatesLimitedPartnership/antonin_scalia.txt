justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
donaldson,
i
don't
know
why
you
concede.
it
seems...
maybe
i
misunderstood,
but
you
appear
to
concede
that
neglect
always
has
an
element
of
negligence
or
blameworthiness
about
it.
why
do
you
concede
that?
i
don't
think
that
it
does
invariably.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
talk
about
a
neglected
house.
maybe
the
person
doesn't
care
about
or
doesn't...
the
person
doesn't
want
to
spend
any
more
money
on
it.
it
doesn't
mean
that
there's
any
blame
involved.
it's
just
a
failure
to
do
something
that
could
be
done
is
neglect.
he
neglected
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
failed
to
do
it.
it's
the
same
as
failed.
that's
one
meaning
of
it.
it
can
have
the
other
meaning,
but
it
doesn't
invariably
have
that
meaning
of
negligence
or
blameworthiness,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
you
didn't
say
that
in
response
to
the
questions.
if
that's
your
position,
i
wish
you
would
say
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
donaldson--
--i
was
using
it
there
in
the
second
sense,
mr.
donaldson.
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
donaldson?
having
had
the
benefit
of
that
suggestion,
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
excusable
neglect
as
either
you
or
justice
scalia
would
interpret
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
understand
that
your
position
is
that
the
factors
to
be
included
can
only
be
factors
that
have
to
do
with
the
action
or
the
state
of
mind
of
the
person
who
is
allegedly
excusably
neglectful?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
you
cannot
take
into
account,
for
example,
how
much
harm
has
been
caused
by
the
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
either
excusably
neglectful
or
not,
and
if
he
is,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
has
caused
a
whole
lot
of
harm.
it's
still
excusable
neglect.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
no,
they
have
brought
themselves
within
the
rule,
but
what
the
rule
says,
as
justice
souter
points
out,
is
that
the
court
may
permit
the
act
to
be
done.
that's
the
rule.
the
court
may.
i
don't
know
why
you
fight
this.
it's
a
discretion
that's
all
in
your
favor.
it's
not
a
discretion
that
could
possibly
hurt
the
interests
of
your
client.
it's
a
discretion
not
to
allow
the
excusable
neglect
even
though
you
have
authority
to
do
so,
where
in
justice
stevens'
example,
for
instance,
the
consequences
are
enormous
of
allowing
it
to
be
filed
late.
don't
you
think
there's
room
in
the
words
excusable
neglect
to
mean
that,
well,
there
has
been
neglect
in
this
case,
but
because
of
other
considerations,
we're
going
to
excuse
it?
this
is
saying
that
excusable
doesn't
necessarily
define
neglect.
it's
just
a...
it
defines...
it
tells
the
court,
no
matter
what
the
neglect
is,
you
can
excuse
it
based
on
other
considerations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
one
of
your
arguments
to
be
that
excusable
neglect
cannot
consist
of
circumstance...
exclusively
of
circumstances
reasonably
beyond
the
control
of
the
party
for
the
reason
that
that
would
not
be
neglect
because
there
would
not
be
any
negligence
or
blame
attachable,
if
it
were
circumstances
beyond
the
control
of
the
party.
isn't
that
one
of
the
arguments
you
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
to
understand
then
that
where
you
are
negligent
or
blameworthy,
but
you
have
some
excuse,
you
are
in
better
shape
for
purposes
of
this
rule
than
if
you're
not
blameworthy
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
a
person
where
the
circumstances
are
beyond
his
control?
if
it
doesn't
come
within
the
meaning
of
906(b)(1),
what
do
you
do
in
that
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
thing?
his
car
is
engulfed
by
a
flood
on
the
way
to
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
covered
by
906(a),
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
one
small
example
of
absolute...
circumstances
that
absolutely
prevent
it.
there
are
so
many
others
i
can
think
of,
and
you
say
that's
not
covered
by
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
another
single
instance,
but
why
don't
you
just
cover
my
one
instance
of
the
car
being
swept
away
on
the
way
to
the
courthouse.
what
do
you
say
covers
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
say
it
goes
beyond
circumstances
entirely
beyond
the
reasonable
control
and
includes
some
other
factors,
all
of
which,
however,
have
to
do
with
the
subjective
actions
of
the
individual
and
does
not
include
such
extrinsic
elements
as
how
much
hardship
is
produced
to
the
other
party.
you'd
have
a
whole
lot
of
discretion
still
within
the
meaning
of
excusable
so
long
as
it's
limited
to
factors
affecting
the
subjective
actions
of
the
individual.
and
then
you
would
have
additional
discretion
at
the
back
end
because
even
when
the
court
finds
excusable
neglect,
it
need
not...
it
may,
as
the
rule
says,
but
it
need
not
use
that.
and
once
again,
that
would
be
up
to
its
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
word
excusable
have
some
notion
of
looking
into
the
motives
and
the
subjective
inclinations
of
the
actor?
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
consider
it
excusable
neglect
if
you
violate
the
rule
but
you
didn't
cause
any
harm.
i
mean,
could
the
court
say,
well,
it's
excusable
neglect
because
even
though
he's
out
of
time,
what's
the
harm.
it's
no
big
deal.
he's
a
week
late.
nobody
is
going
to
be
harmed.
i'll
just
extend
it.
it's
excusable
neglect
because
it's
harmless.
is
that
excusable
neglect?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
an
intentional
failure
to
file
it
on
time.
he
just
said
i'm
going
to
be
a
week
late,
and
the
court
said
no
harm
done.
