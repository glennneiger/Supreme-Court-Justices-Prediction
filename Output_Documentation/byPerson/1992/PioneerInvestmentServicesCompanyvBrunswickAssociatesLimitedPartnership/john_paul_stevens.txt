what
would...
when
should
a
judge
ever
excuse
neglect
either
the
way
you
define
it
or
the
way
justice
scalia
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
say
that
was
neglect
in
that...
and
you
think
that's
the
way
in
which
they
meant
the
neglect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
a
step
or
so?
whether
it's
a
$100
million
windfall
or
a
10
cent
windfall
is
totally
irrelevant.
that's
one.
also,
i
take
it
it's
totally
irrelevant
whether
it's
a
10-minute
delay
or
a
3-year
delay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you?
how
much
is
the
windfall
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
is...
how
much
do
the
creditors
claim
the
windfall
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
$6
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
no
prejudice
whatsoever
to
the
state
in
allowing
the
claim
other
than
the
fact
you
have
to
defend
the
claim,
which
you
otherwise
wouldn't
have
to
defend.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
extended
for
5
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
because
there's
much
more
money
to
pay.
