chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1695,
pioneer
investment
services
company
v.
brunswick
associates
limited
partnership.
mr.
donaldson,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
definition
any
improvement
on
the
statutory
language?
it
doesn't
seem
to
say
anything
more
than
excusable
neglect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
provision
of
the...
what
does
the
federal...
provision
in
the
federal
rules
that
talks
about
default
judgments
say?
doesn't
it
use
the
term
excusable
neglect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
we
need
a
definition
of
excusable
neglect?
why
not
leave
it
largely
to...
don't
you
think
congress
may
have
intended
to
leave
it
largely
to
the
discretion
of
the
initial
court,
the
bankruptcy
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
a
tickler
system
set
up
in
your
office
that
worked
regularly
where
you
were
given
a
note
the
day
before
something
was
due
that
it's
due
tomorrow,
and
it
just
failed
on
this
one
occasion?
would
that
be
an
example
of,
a,
neglect
and,
b,
of
excusable
neglect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which...
it
would
be...
it
would
not
be
neglect
or
it
would
not
be
excusable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
in
the
case,
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
you
is
that
neglect
not
excusable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
by...
mere...
but
by
hypothesis
the
statute
says
some
neglect
is
excusable,
and
to
say
that
mere
neglect
is
never
excusable
simply
defies
the
statutory
language.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
an
argument
for
confiding
a
great
deal
of
discretion
as
congress
may
have
intended
to
the
district
courts
or
the
bankruptcy
courts
here?
we
don't
want
thousands
of
little
annotations
in
law
books
saying
this
is
or
is
not
excusable
neglect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
donaldson.
mr.
lucas,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
this
case,
mr.
lucas,
the
bankruptcy
court
ruled
against
your
client,
and
then
the
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
ruled
against
it,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
is
something
that
should
be
reviewed
on
a
legal
basis
every
time
a
bankruptcy
court
reaches
a
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
it
as
good
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
imagine
more
severe
consequences
than
in
link
when
the
plaintiff's
complaint
was
dismissed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
here
the
bankruptcy
court
denied
your
motion.
the
district
court
denied
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
those
courts
had
any
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
an
argument
certainly
why
the
bankruptcy
court
was
wrong
in
exercising
its
discretion
in
this
case,
but
it...
do
you
support
the
view
taken
by
the
sixth
circuit,
as
justice
white
reads
its
opinion,
as
i
do,
that
whatever
the
consequences...
whatever
the
neglect
of
the
attorney,
it
should
not
be
visited
on
the
client?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
it
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
if
the
sixth
circuit
said
otherwise,
you
don't
find
it
necessary
to
uphold
that
part
of
the
sixth
circuit--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
quite
what
the
statute
says.
the
last
clause
says
where
the
failure
to
act
was
the
result
of
excusable
neglect.
it
seems
to
me
that
does
tie
it
down
rather
closely
to
the
acts
of
the
person
who
should
have
acted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
there
be
any
virtue
in
tying
the
phrase
excusable
neglect
in
this
bankruptcy
rule
into
the
provisions
of
rule
60(b)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
i'm
sure
there
must
be
some
decisions
construing
the
same
phrase?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lucas.
mr.
donaldson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
donaldson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1695,
pioneer
investments
services
co.
versus
brunswick
associated
ltd
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
