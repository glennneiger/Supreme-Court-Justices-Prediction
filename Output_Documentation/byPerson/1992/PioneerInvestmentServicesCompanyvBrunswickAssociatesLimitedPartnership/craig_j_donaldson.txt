mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
which
allowed
the
respondents
who
were
claimants
in
pioneer's
chapter
11
case
to
file
their
proofs
of
claim
out
of
time
based
upon
a
finding
by
the
sixth
circuit
that
their
failure
to
file
within
the
originally
prescribed
deadline
was
the
result
of
excusable
neglect.
to
reach
that
result,
the
sixth
circuit
adopted
a
test
that
was
first
enunciated
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
in
re
dix
and
has
been
referred
to
frequently
as
the
liberal
interpretation
of
excusable
neglect
focusing
on
five
factors
set
forth
in
that
opinion.
the
sixth
circuit
also,
to
reach
the
result
that
it
did,
had
to
consider
an
equitable
factor
which
was,
in
its
opinion,
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
debtor
to
allow
these
proofs
of
claim
to
be
filed
under
the
excusable
neglect
standard.
and
finally,
what
it
had
to
do,
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
link
v.
the
wabash
railroad
decided
some
30
years
ago,
said
that
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
courts
below
to
punish
the
respondents
for
the
neglect
of
their
counsel.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
opinion
clearly
is
wrong
on
all
three
counts
and
must
be
reversed.
the
first
error
is
in
the
adoption
of
the
test
itself.
petitioner
submits
to
the
court
that
the
test
adopted
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
followed
by
the
ninth
does
violence
to
and
runs
plainly
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
rule
9006(b)(1)
itself,
which
states
that
where,
as
here,
a
motion
for
an
extension
of
time
was
filed
after
the
deadline
has
expired,
the
court
has
to
find
that
the
failure
to
act
was
the
result
of
excusable
neglect.
as
the
eleventh
circuit
stated,
and
we
contend
properly
so,
in
the
south
atlantic
case,
the
words
failure
to
act
in
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
limit
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
to
the
actions
or
inactions
of
the
movant
and
to
the
reasons
for
their
failure
to
act
within
the
time
provided,
and
that
they
do
not
permit,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
and
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case,
consideration
of
factors
other
than
why
didn't
they
do
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
within
the
time
they
were
supposed
to
do
it,
and
what
were
the
reasons
for
that.
the
concept
that
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
debtor
we
submit
under
the
authorities,
not
only
the
eleventh
circuit,
but
in
the
decisions
of
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
and
eleventh
circuits
that
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
all
hold
uniformly
that
there
is
no
room
for
consideration
of
so-called
equitable
factors
in
determining
whether
the
failure
to
act
under
rule
9006
is
a
result
of
excusable
neglect.
the
bankruptcy
code
quite
clearly
in
section
1111(a)
dictates
who
must
in
a
chapter
11
case
file
a
proof
of
claim,
and
it
says
that
if
your
claim
is
listed
as
disputed,
contingent,
or
unliquidated,
you
must
file
a
proof
of
claim.
bankruptcy
rule
3003
supplementing
the
code
section
goes
on
to
say
also
that
if
your
claim
is
not
listed
or
you
do
not
agree
with
the
amount
listed
on
the
debtor's
schedule,
you
must
file
a
proof
of
claim.
and
the
facts
here
clearly
show
that
three
of
the
respondents
were
listed
as
disputed
and
unliquidated,
and
one
was
not
listed
at
all.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
congressional
intent
that
underlies
section
1111
in
the
bankruptcy
rules
is
to
clearly
place
an
affirmative
duty
on
creditors
who
fall
within
the
definition
of
the
code
and
rules
to
file
their
proofs
of
claim
if
they
want
to
be
able
to
participate
in
the
debtor's
chapter
11
reorganization
in
three
very
important
respects:
one,
to
have
their
claim
allowed;
two,
to
have
a
right
to
vote
on
the
plan
of
reorganization;
and
three,
and
probably
most
importantly,
to
receive
a
distribution
from
the
debtor's
estate.
and
as
the
decisions
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
recognize,
there
was
a
congressional
intent
underlying
this
section
requiring
these
creditors
to
file
these
claims
to
promote
certainty
and
finality
in
chapter
11
proceedings.
and
these
courts,
contrary
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
dix
case,
say
that
this
congressional
intent
precludes
courts
from
finding
exceptions
based
on
equitable
considerations
or
equitable
factors.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
would
agree
wholeheartedly,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
excusable
neglect,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
knows,
is
nowhere
defined
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
the
rules
and,
for
that
matter,
is
nowhere
defined
in
the
similar
rule
6
of
the
federal
rules.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
south
atlantic
case
defined
excusable
neglect
as
follows:
the
failure
to
timely
perform
a
duty
that
was
due
to
circumstances
which
were
beyond
the
reasonable
control
of
the
person
whose
duty
it
was
to
perform.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think
it
is
an
improvement,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
this
reason.
when
the
statute
talks
about
excusable
neglect
in
this
definition
which
says...
the
essential
part
being
beyond
the
reasonable
control,
granted
it
is
somewhat
nebulous,
but
i
think
it
clearly
implies
that
when
you
come
into
court
saying
excusable
neglect,
you
have
to
come
in
and
present
circumstances
that
are
unique
or
extraordinary,
that
are
beyond--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--if
your
honor
please,
rule
55(c)
that
talks
about
the
entry
of
default
only
is
for
cause
shown.
rule
60(b),
where
you
would
come
in
to
ask
to
set
aside
a
default
judgment
entered
by
the
court,
talks
about
excusable
neglect.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may
expound,
though.
i
think
congress,
by
using
the
term
excusable
neglect,
certainly
left
it
to
the
courts
to
exercise
their
discretion.
however,
as
this
court
said
not
too
many
years
ago
in
united
states
v.
boyle,
what
elements
constitute
excusable
neglect
is
a
question
of
law
that
clearly
is
unsettled,
and
we
are
asking
the
court
here
today
in
this
case
to
settle
it.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
justice
white,
the
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--is
no,
as
phrased,
because
neglect,
obviously,
means
that
something
has
to
be
within
your
control
and
you
failed
to
do
it.
but
the
test,
as
enunciated
by
the
eleventh
circuit
and
followed
by
the
substantial--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
they're
not
saying
it's
beyond
your
control.
they
qualify
it
by
saying
it's
beyond
your
reasonable
control.
they
don't
say
it's...
they
don't
say
you
have
to
come
in
and
prove
something
was
totally
beyond
your
control
before
you
show
excusable
neglect.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
don't
believe
so.
they--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--well,
they
say
beyond
the
reasonable
control,
and
i
think
what
they
mean
by
that
is...
and
i
think
the
case
authority
supports
it...
is
that
mere
ordinary,
garden
variety
neglect
of
counsel,
simple
inadvertence
if
you
will,
is
not
going
to
suffice
to
let
someone
be
relieved
from
a
deadline
that
is
imposed
by
other
rules
of
the
court,
that
that
discretion
that's
vested
in
the
court
has
to
be
circumscribed
by
something
that
shows
that
the
reason
you
failed
to
act
is
due
to
something
unique
or
extraordinary.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think
that...
i
think
that's--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--i
think
that's
proper,
justice
white,
but
i
think
someone...
and
i
respectfully
suggest
it
falls
to
the
duty
of
this
court...
is
to
tell
the
courts
below
how
they
determine
whether
it's
going
to
be
excusable.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
yes,
justice
white.
i
suggest
it--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--that
is
the
other
error,
and
you're
absolutely
correct.
they
said,
well,
the
client
didn't
do
anything
wrong,
and
we're
not
going
to
punish
the
client
because
the
lawyer
was
neglectful.
and
that
is
the
other
part
of
our
argument.
going
back
to
1962
and
the
decision
of
this
case
in
link
v.
the
wabash
railroad,
this
court
clearly
laid
down
the
proposition
that
a
party
cannot
escape
the
consequences
of
the
acts
and
omissions
of
his
attorney,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
sixth
circuit
allowed
these
respondents--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--i
think--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--i
think
what
they
said
was--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--well,
i
would
think
any
attorney
is
certainly
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
rules
and
the
statute
and--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--no,
not
since...
in
substance
as
far
as
who
was
supposed
to
file
their
claims
and
within
what
time,
it
had
been
the
same
since
the
enactment
in
1978.
although
the
rules
of
procedure
had
changed
by
number,
by
substance,
they
really
hadn't.
so,
really--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--i
think
by--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--i
agree.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
no.
i
think--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--no.
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
an
accepted
definition
of
neglect
certainly
is
very
simply
the
failure
to
do
an
act.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
failed
to
do
it.
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
what
would
be
acceptable--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--if...
one
that
comes
right
away
to
mind,
justice
stevens,
is
if
the
attorney
or
the
counsel
never
received
notice
of
the
bar
date.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think
that's
a
unique
or
extraordinary...
i
don't
go
by
so
much
the
word
neglect
as
i
do
the
word
excusable.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
it
would
be
neglect,
but
it
would
not
be
excusable
because--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
based
on
the
record
here,
mr.
richards
went
far
beyond
the
grounds
of
neglect
or
concurrent
findings
by
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
district
court
that
not
only
was
he
negligent,
he
was
totally
indifferent
to
the
bar
date.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
the
failure
in
your
office
of
the
tickler
system?
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think
because
the
cases
hold
and
the
way
the
statute
is
construed,
that
mere
neglect
of
counsel
or
counsel's
staff
will
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
being
excusable.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
well,
i
think
where
that
gets
perilously
close
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
this.
maybe
something
like
if
you
did
have
a
tickler
system
and
you've
taken
all
the
steps
you
could
conceivably
take
to
make
sure
you
don't
fall
through
the
trap
of
missing
a
deadline
and
that
system
malfunctions,
but
that
leads
to
these
problems.
then
the
next
question
might
be,
well,
shouldn't
you
have
had
a
backup
system,
and
i
think
you
get
into
a
series
of
what
if's
that
engulf
the
rule.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
right.
i
think
the
congress
clearly
has
conferred
that
discretion
on
the
lower
courts,
but
it
also
attempted
to,
and
i
think
does,
circumscribe
it.
it's
not
an
unbridled
discretion
that
any
time
someone
runs
into
court
and
says...
well,
particularly
like
this
case,
runs
into
court
and
says,
well,
it's
my
lawyer's
fault,
or
i
forgot
to
read
something,
or
a
lawyer
comes
in
and
said
i
forgot
to
read
something.
if
that
were
permitted
to
be
the
standard
of
excusable
neglect,
i
dare
say
it
would
do
away
with
the
efficacy
of
any
deadline
set
under
any
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
to
answer
your
question,
justice
white,
i
certainly
would
be
happy
to
win
the
case
on
that--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i'd
rather
win
it
on
some
other
ground,
but
for
the
sake
of
the
system
and
the
efficient
administration
of
justice
throughout
the
federal
system
at
least,
i
would
like
to
win
it
on
a
ground
where--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--i
would
like
this
court
to
adopt
as
bright
a
line
as
possible
as
to
what
factors
are
to
be
considered
or
what
the
appropriate
definition
is
of
excusable
neglect
because--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--yes,
sir.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
that's
correct.
i
think
it
has
to
be
determined
solely
by
the
actions
of
the
moving
party
and
the
reasons
for
those
actions
without
consideration
of
any
other,
what
you
might
call
equitable
factors,
such
as
prejudice
or
lack
thereof.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
has
to
be.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think,
to
answer
your
question,
no,
and
if
i
may
expound.
the
statute...
the
last
sentence
begins
with
the
failure
to
act.
i
think
the
plain
language
of
the
words
failure
to
act
directs
the
focus
solely
and
exclusively
to
what
the
movant
did
or
didn't
do
and
the
reasons
for
that.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
but
i
think
it
does
for
this
reason.
if
a
party
could
come
in
and,
in
fact,
establish
that
there
was
excusable
neglect,
however
determined,
even
if
that
would
result
in
the
most
extreme
prejudice
to
the
debtor,
i
think
the
court
has
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
let
that
creditor
file
its
claim
regardless
of
the
consequences
if--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--they
could
have
done
that,
but
they
did
not.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
would
think
if
the
party
comes
in
and
proves
that
the
neglect...
that
their
failure
to
act
was
excusable
neglect,
that
they
have
brought
themselves
within
rule
9006(b)(1),
and
that
the
court
would
have
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
let
them
in.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
rule
intends.
i
think
what
the
rule--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--well,
perhaps
there
is
after
you
first
determine
whether
the
failure
to
act
was
the
result
of
excusable
neglect.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
i
think
it
may
be.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
to
answer
your
question
directly,
your
honor,
none.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
in
excess
of
$6
million.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
yes,
sir.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
well,
i
think
there
is.
what
has
been
overlooked
is
the
prejudice
the
other
creditors
who
timely
did
file
whose
payout
period
would
be
extended
by...
from
5
years
to
10.
so
there's
definitely
prejudice
to
the
other
creditors.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
that's
what
the
plan
provides,
justice
stevens,
is
if
these
claims
were
ever
ultimately
allowed
to
pay
out,
the
unsecured
creditors--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
say
that
the
test
that
we
advance
here
is
inflexible.
what
i
would
say
to
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
is
the
test
advanced
here
by
the
respondent
is
no
test
at
all.
it
leads
to
an
unbridled,
unchecked
discretion
vested
in
lower
courts
that,
in
effect,
any
time
someone
comes
in
with
any
excuse,
whatever
it
may
be,
that
a
deadline
is
going
to
be
extended.
and
as
i
said
earlier
in
our
argument,
in
construing
this
term,
it
cannot
be
construed
such
that
it
just
sweeps
away
deadlines
imposed
by
other
rules
of
the
court
which
are
necessary
to
the
efficient
administration
of
justice.
in
particular
reference
to
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
below,
the
only
way
that
the
sixth
circuit
found
the
bankruptcy
court
and
district
court
abused
this
discretion
was
predicated
on
the
finding
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
penalize
the
party
for
the
negligence
of
counsel.
had
it
not
found
that,
and
had
it
found
that
it
should
have
penalized,
as
the
bankruptcy
court
and
district
court
did,
the
respondents
for
the
neglect
of
their
counsel,
the
sixth
circuit
could
not
have
found
that
the
bankruptcy
court
and
district
court
abused
their
discretion.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
but
i
think
the
rule
looks,
justice
white,
at
the
negligence
of
the
party
and
the
party's
counsel,
and
if
one
of
them
is
at
fault...
well,
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
client,
if
the
lawyer
is
at
fault,
the
client
i
think
under
link
has
to
suffer
the
consequences.
but
ultimately
the
system
allocates
the
burden
properly
because
the
client
still
has,
which
is
exactly
what
has
been
done
in
this
case,
its
action
against...
over
against
the
attorney
for
whatever
damages
it
sustained
as
a
result
of
his
negligence.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
or
what
he
could
prove--
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
--yes,
sir.
finally,
to
answer
one
point...
two
points
of
mr.
lucas
very
briefly.
he
says
that
from
the
hoos
case
and
the
need
for
finality
came
out
of
the
bankruptcy
act
because
at
that
point
you
filed
plans
of
confirmation,
and
he
seems
to
imply
that
the
need
for
finality
and
certainty
is
less
now
under
the
bankruptcy
code
and
rules
than
it
was
under
the
act.
and
i
submit
it's
exactly
in
reverse.
the
bankruptcy
code
and
rules
now
say
that
the
court
shall
fix
the
time
within
which
claims
are
to
be
filed.
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
pardon,
justice
white?
mr.
craig
j.
donaldson
if
it
does
so
before
the
expiration
of
the
date
set,
the
plain
language
of
rule
3003
says
for
cause
shown,
that
the
court
may
extend
it
provided
that
it's
done
before
the
expiration
of
the
original
period.
but
i
think
that
the...
i'm
sorry.
thank
you.
