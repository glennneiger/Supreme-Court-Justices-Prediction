mr.
john
a.
lucas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
focus
at
the
outset
on
what
i
believe
is
the
key
issue
and...
which
the
court...
many
members
of
the
court
have
been
addressing
in
their
questions
to
my
adversary,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioners
advocate,
in
essence,
a
nondiscretionary,
strict,
in
their
words,
inflexible
rule
to
be
applied
only
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
that
is
not
an
exercise
of
discretion.
the
respondents,
on
the
other
hand,
submit
that
this
is
and
should
be
a
discretionary
standard
in
which
the
lower
courts
are
permitted
flexibility
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion
as
guided
perhaps
by
certain
guideposts
set
by
this
court.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
the
bankruptcy
court
did,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that
the
bankruptcy
court,
in
effect,
abused
its
discretion
because
of
the
way
that
it
weighed
the
factors.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
review
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
will
be
a
very
rare
review.
when
litigants
and
attorneys
know
that
the
bankruptcy
court
is
exercising
its
discretion
and
is
operating
within
a
fairly
broad
framework,
then
the
chances
of
cases
being
appealed
for
abuse
of
discretion
are
very
rare.
and,
in
fact,
we
believe
that
it
will
cut
down
on
this
collateral
litigation
rather
than
promote
it.
but
if
the
court
attempts
to
draw
a
bright
line
rule,
a
rule...
a
bright
line
that
i
submit
does
not
exist
and
cannot
exist,
but
if
the
court
were
to
attempt
that,
that
would
increase
the
collateral
litigation.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
i
believe
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
that's
one
of
the
points
of
our
appeal
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
erred
in
the
way
it
weighed
these
factors
because
the
way
it
weighed
them...
and
i'll
come
to
this
in
a
moment,
but
it
weighed
them
in
a
way
that
inevitably
would
find
against
clients
like
mine
who
moved
expeditiously
to
correct
their
error,
to
correct
their
neglect
and,
in
effect,
weighed
these
factors
in
a
way
that
put
undue
emphasis
and
put
sole
emphasis
on
this
beyond
reasonable
control
test
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
accepted
in
the
first
instance
and
which
was
continually
urged
by
petitioners.
your
honor,
let
me
add--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
covered
in
other
rules.
for
example,
one
of
the
examples
frequently
given,
not
one
that
my
opponent
gave,
but
it's
when
the
courthouse
for
some
reason
is
just
physically
inaccessible.
a
practitioner
in
san
francisco
and
there's
an
earthquake
and
he
cannot
get
to
the
courthouse.
it's
beyond
his
reasonable
control.
that's
the
type
of
example
that
some
lower
courts
have
given.
that's
covered
in
the
same
rule.
in
rule
9006(a),
it
provides
that
if
the
courthouse
is
inaccessible,
then
it
will
be
extended
under
subsection
(a).
mr.
john
a.
lucas
no,
your
honor--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--9006(a)
covers
where
the
courthouse
is
physically...
is
inaccessible.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
are
other
ways
of
covering.
i
believe
that
under,
for
example,
section
105
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
is
a
broad
grant
of
equitable
powers,
that
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
grant
extensions
such
as
your
honor
just
suggested
in
your
question.
there's
also
constitutional
ramifications
here.
for
example,
one
of
the
contexts
that
this
situation
arises
in
is
creditors
who
never
received
notice
of
the
bankruptcy,
consequently
never
filed
a
proof
of
claim,
never
moved
for
an
extension
of
time
because
they
weren't
aware
of
it.
and
there's
a
well-developed
body
of
case
law
that
says
you
cannot
deprive
those
creditors
of
their
property
right
without
due
process,
meaning
that
they
have
to
get
notice.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
either
the...
either
section
105
of
the
bankruptcy
code--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--your
honor,
that's
a
section
that
essentially
grants
the
court
inherent
equitable
powers,
makes
the
bankruptcy
court
a
court
of
equity.
and
it
has
been
the
subject
of
some
case
law
in
this
court
and
in
the
lower
courts
which
says,
well,
that
can't
be
used
in
derogation
of
specific
provisions.
but
i
think
the
section
105
could
be
used
in
this
instance
to
fill
in
a
gap
if
that
were
a
gap.
it
also
might
come
under
the
doctrine
of
equitable
tolling.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
we
would
articulate
the
rule
slightly
differently.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
in
this
situation
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
under
the
circumstances,
it
would
be
unfair
to
penalize
the
client.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
well,
i
believe
that
they
did
ultimately
because
they
were
addressing
the
question
at
the
outset
of
excusable
neglect.
we're
not
trying
to
overturn
link
v.
wabash.
we
accept
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument
as
good
law.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
i
believe
it
did,
your
honor,
because
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
we're
going
to...
whether
or
not
the
client
is
chargeable
with
the
acts
or
omissions
of
attorney,
it's
what
are
the
consequences
of
that.
and
link
says
that
the
client,
having
chosen
attorney...
having
chosen
an
attorney,
is
bound
by
the
acts
of
his
attorney
and,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
that
he
cannot
avoid
the
consequences
of
having
chosen
his
own
attorney.
and
the
question
here
is
what
should
those
consequences
be.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
here's
an
important
point
about
link.
link
supports
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
because
you
will
recall
that
in
link
this
court
affirmed
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
had
dismissed
a
case
for
the
plaintiff's
attorney's
failure
to
appear
at
a
pretrial
conference,
and
this
court
gave
the
trial
court
discretion
and
said
it
could
do
that
based
upon
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
the
record
which
were
known
to
the
trial
court,
and
that
this
court
would
grant
the
district
courts
that
discretion.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
well,
they
did
both
deny,
but
let
me
jump,
if
i
may,
to
the
last
point
of
my
argument,
which
is
to
why
the
bankruptcy
court
abused
its
discretion.
in
the
respondent's
favor,
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
debtor
or
to
other
creditors.
and
mr.
donaldson
was
asked
a
moment
ago
by
justice
scalia,
well,
why
does
he
fight
this
discretionary
rule.
the
reason
that
the
petitioner
fights
the
discretionary
rule
is
they
know
that
if
the
discretion
is
weighed
properly,
that
the
respondents'
claims
should
be
filed
because
there
was
no
prejudice
to
anyone.
the
bankruptcy
court
so
found,
and
it
has
been
affirmed
by
the
district
court,
not
the
subject
of
appeal.
no
adverse
impact
on
judicial
administration,
no
bad
faith.
and
the
bankruptcy
court
said...
curiously
they
said
but
early
in
the
case,
like
here,
and
where
there's
a
short
delay,
like
here,
those
factors
will
seldom,
if
ever,
be
present.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
i
don't
think
that
makes
a
difference,
justice
white.
but--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--it
was
a
human
error.
we
concede
it
was
neglect,
but
the
way
the
bankruptcy
court
weighed
these
factors,
it
said
that
early
in
the
case
they
will
hardly
ever
be
present
where
the
delay
like
here
is
short.
and
so,
they
said...
the
bankruptcy
court
said,
therefore,
i'm
going
to
look
at
whether
or
not
it
was
within
their
reasonable
control
and
focus
on
that.
so,
early
in
the
case
where
creditors,
such
as
my
client,
is
diligent,
realizes
their
mistake,
takes
actions
promptly
to
cure
it,
they're
penalized
the
way
the
bankruptcy
court
weighed
the
factors
because
he
says,
well,
i
won't
consider
those
because
it's
too
early
in
the
case.
they
won't
be
present.
but
he
created
a
catch-22
because
late
in
the
case
those
factors
will
almost
always
be
present.
there's
a
much
greater
risk
of
prejudice,
impact
on
judicial
administration,
bad
faith,
and
the
like
late
in
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--i
don't
support
it
the
way
your
honor
just
articulated
it.
if
your
honor
meant
to
say
must
the
sins
of
the
attorney
always
be
visited
upon
the
client,
then
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
no.
i
believe
that
the
courts
in
some
circumstances
have
some
discretion.
there's
attorney
sins
and
there's
client
sins.
an
example
is
rule
11.
there's...
there
are
some
instances
in
rule
11
where
the
courts
say
we're
going
to
visit
this
sin
upon
the
attorney
because
it's
an
attorney-type
error.
other
times
it's
appropriate
to
penalize
the
client.
so,
link
doesn't
purport
to
overrule
that
sort
of
distinction.
but
in
this
case,
i
say
that
we
are
not
attempting
to
overrule
link,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
sixth
circuit
decision
relied
upon
link,
we
think
it
can
be
affirmed
on
other
grounds
because
we
say
in
this
case
we
acknowledge
that
there
was
neglect,
and
we
acknowledge
that
that
neglect
is
imputable
to
the
respondents.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
but
i
still--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--that
is
correct
because
i
still
say
that
begs
the
question.
now
that
the
respondents
are
charged
with
their
client's
neglect,
the
rule
then
inquires
should
we
excuse
that
neglect.
i
think
it's
appropriate
at
this
point
to...
i'd
like
to
refer
to
a
case...
an
opinion
that
justice
scalia
wrote
for
the
majority
in
1988,
pierce
v.
underwood,
and
in
that
case,
your
honor
may
recall
that
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
substantially
justified
for
purposes
of
an
award
of
attorney's
fees.
and
justice
scalia,
writing
for
the
majority,
said
that
the
court
was
going
to
eschew
what
justice
scalia
and
the
court
termed
a
rigorously
scientific
approach
and
said
because
of
the
large
number
of
possible
situations
in
which
the
phrase
might
arise,
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
draw
a
set
of
narrow
guidelines,
that
this
was
simply
an
area
in
which
the
court...
the
lower
courts
had
to
have
a
substantial
amount
of
discretion.
and
the
court
also
said
that
it
would
not
choose
to
substitute
a
different
formula
for
the
formula
substantially
justified
which
had
been
chosen
by
congress.
we
think
that
that
holding
is
applicable
to
this
case
also
because
what
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
do,
your
honors,
is
to
substitute
new
words
for
the
words
that
exist
in
the
rule.
they
want
the
rule
to
read
that
an
extension
of
time
may
be
granted
where
the
failure
to
act
was
due
to
circumstances
beyond
the
reasonable
control
of
the
moving
party,
and
that's
simply
not
what
the
rule
says.
the
rule
grants
on
its
face
the
trial
court's
discretion.
it
says
that
the
trial
court,
in
its
discretion,
may
extend
the
time.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
rule
that
dictates
that
approach.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
that
the
only
focus
shall
be
on
the
actions
of
the
moving
party
or
the
party
who
has
failed
to
act.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
it
comports
not
only
with
the
face
of
the
rule,
but
just
with
our
everyday
experience
when
we
inquire
if
a
person
has
transgressed,
whether
it's
neglect,
an
act,
or
omission,
but
if
a
person
has
failed
to
act
or
if
they've
transgressed
in
some
way
and
we
then
visit
the
question
of
should
we
excuse
their
transgression,
should
we
excuse
their
failure
to
act,
what
is
a
perfectly
logical
inquiry?
what
harm
have
they
caused?
mr.
john
a.
lucas
but
it's
where
the
failure
to
act
is
simply
a
descriptive
trigger,
if
you
will,
for
describing
what
has
happened.
remember...
and
this
is
extremely
important...
that
rule
9006
is
a
rule
of
general
application.
we're
describing
all
sorts
of
omissions
here.
this
is
not
a
rule
that
deals
just
with
bankruptcy
proofs
of
claim.
like
its
counterpart
in
the
federal
civil
rules,
federal
rule
6,
this
deals
with
obtaining
an
extension
of
time
under...
for
virtually
any
filing
required
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
a
civil
suit
or
any
filing
in
a
bankruptcy
case.
so
the
phrase,
where
the
failure
to
act,
is
simply
a
description
that
triggers
the
rule.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
it
may
be
a
proper
factor
to
weigh,
justice
scalia,
not
the
only
factor,
but
i
think
whether
or
not
there
is
harm
is
a
factor
that
the
court
should
weigh.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
i
misunderstood
the
question
then,
your
honor.
if
it's
intentional,
then
the
element
of
good
faith
comes
in
and
good
faith
might
well
be
decisive
if
it's
intentional.
but
the
point
is
that
the
petitioner's
test
fails
to
allow
any
of
these
things
to
be
weighed.
we
say
that
they
should
weigh
the
prejudice
to
other
parties,
other
creditors,
prejudice
to
the
court
essentially
in
the
impact
on
judicial
administration,
good
faith.
there's
a
fourth
element
that
i
would
suggest
that
would
go
into
the
calculus
properly
which
is
not
covered
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
deadline
missed
and
what
is
the
impact
on
the
moving
party.
keeping
in
mind
that
this
rule
applies,
as
i
said,
to
virtually
any
filing,
under
the
federal
rules,
it
applies
to
answers,
it
applies
to
discovery
responses,
it
applies
to
briefs,
it
applies
to
proofs
of
claim,
it
applies
to
notices
of
appeal.
and
the
way
you
weigh
these
factors,
and
particularly
the
good
faith
factor,
might
vary
from
case
to
case,
but
that's
what
discretion
is
all
about.
and
that's
the
type
of
discretion
that
the
court
allowed
the
trial
courts
in
pierce
v.
underwood,
and
we
submit
that
that
discretion
is
appropriate
here
because
on
the
face
of
the
rule
it
says
that
the
court
may
in
its
discretion.
your
honor,
there's
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
about
the
source
of
this
beyond
reasonable
control
test
because
that
test,
obviously,
is
not
one
that
appears
on
the
face
of
the
rules
or
the
bankruptcy
code.
it's
not
in
the
plain
language
of
the
rule.
where
do
we
find
it?
the
petitioner
finds
that...
and
this
is
the
linchpin
of
their
argument
because
it
appears
in
the
very
first
section
of
the
argument
portion
of
their
brief,
and
the
rest
of
their
argument
flows
from
the
need
for
finality.
and
they
say,
well,
there's
a
need
for
finality
that
was
articulated
by
the
lower
courts,
and
they
cite
to
a
second
circuit
opinion
in
a
case
called
hoos
v.
dynamics
corporation.
and
they
cite
this
need
for
finality
there.
and
the
reason
that's
so
important
to
the
petitioner
is
that
without
this
need
for
finality
that
they
find
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
an
overriding
need
in
their
view,
you
really
can't
get
to
the
beyond
reasonable
control
language
because
it's
just
not
in
the
rules.
but
in
the
hoos
v.
dynamics
corporation,
the
court
did
discuss
the
need
for
finality,
but...
and
perhaps
it
was
an
overriding
or
the
most
important
need
there,
but
the
circumstances
were
entirely
different
than
they
are
today.
in
that
case,
it
was
decided
under
the
old
bankruptcy
act,
and
in
that
case
creditors
in
a
chapter
11
case
had
until
virtually
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy
process
in
which
to
file
their
proofs
of
claim.
proofs
of
claim
had
to
be
filed
by
confirmation
of
the
plan,
not
before.
that,
as
the
court
knows,
is
virtually
the
last
step
in
the
process.
in
hoos,
the
creditors
were
actually
attempting
to
file
their
claims
after
the
plan
had
already
been
confirmed.
so,
of
course,
there
was
a
need
for
finality.
there's
always
a
need...
a
greater
need
for
finality
at
the
end
of
the
case,
but
the
petitioners
seek
to
extrapolate
from
that
and
say,
well,
in
hoos
there
was
a
need
for
finality
at
the
end
of
the
case.
therefore,
there's
a
need
for
finality
here
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
obviously,
it
just
doesn't
follow,
and
without
that
supposed
need
for
finality,
the
overriding
need
for
finality,
they
simply
can't
get
to
this
beyond
reasonable
control
test
because
that's
the
need
that
has
driven
every
court
of
appeal
that
has
decided
and
articulated
this
beyond
reasonable
control
test.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
yes,
your
honor,
it
has.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
that
is
correct,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
it
illustrates
the
windfall
to
the
debtor,
to
the
petitioner,
if
this
type
of
procedural
defect
is
allowed
to
essentially
deprive
my
clients
of
their
right
to
file
the
claim.
and,
of
course,
once
the
claim
is
filed,
it
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
validity
of
the
claim.
so,
we
do
believe
that
for
purposes
of
this
discussion,
the
claim
has
to
be
accepted
as
a
valid
one,
and
therefore,
there
is
a
$6.9
million
windfall
to
the
debtor
because
that's
the
amount
of
money--
mr.
john
a.
lucas
--it
was
i
believe
a
$55
million
asset
case,
your
honor,
and
it's
a
100
percent
payment
plan.
so,
that
is
the
amount
that
my
clients
have
been
deprived
of
because
their
attorney
was
negligently
20
days
late.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
it
is
affected
to
this
extent
that
without
my
clients'
claims,
it's
a
5-year
payoff.
once
our
claims
are
factored
into
the
plan...
if
our
claims
are
allowed,
it's
a
10-year
payoff.
that
plan,
incidentally,
was
formulated
after...
the
plan
had
not
begun
being
drafted
at
the
time
this
time
extension
was
sought.
so,
the
plan
anticipated...
because
the
litigation
over
the
filing
of
these
claims
was
going
on
while
the
debtor
was
drafting
its
plan,
the
plan
anticipated
and
planned
for
the
eventuality
that
these
claims
would
be
permitted
or
would
be
allowed.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
yes,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
interest
payable,
and
interest
is
being
paid
to
other
creditors
and
has
been
since
the
plar
was
confirmed.
mr.
john
a.
lucas
your
honor,
i
think
that
whatever
decision
this
court
makes
necessarily...
even
if
the
court
attempts
to
limit
it
to
proofs
of
claim
and
bankruptcy
rule
9006,
that
whatever
decision
this
court
makes
will
be
construed
as
also
governing
rule
6
and
all
the
filings
in
federal
civil
litigation
simply
because
the
rule,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
are
identical.
and
the
phrase
excusable
neglect,
if
the
court
is
going
to
avoid
the
one-subsection-at-a-time
approach
to
the
statutory
construction,
if
we're
going
to
avoid
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
to
be
construed
uniformly.
if
it's
going
to
be
an
absolute,
strict
standard
allowing
no
exceptions
except
for
matters
beyond
the
moving
party's
reasonable
control
here,
then
the
same
must
be
true
for
a
party
who
files
an
answer
1
day
late
in
a
lawsuit.
and
let
me
use
that
example,
if
i
may,
to
sort
of
highlight
the
everyday
litigation
problems
that
would
flow
from
the
rule
proposed
by
petitioners
if
it
were
accepted
by
this
court.
let's
take
a
hypothetical
example
of
a
defendant
in
a
lawsuit
who
is
served
with
a
summons
and,
of
course,
required
to
answer
in
20
days.
but
through
an
administrative
error,
clerical
breakdown,
whatever,
through
neglect,
for
reasons
within
his
control,
the
defendant
doesn't
answer
the
lawsuit,
say,
a
$7
million
lawsuit,
until
the
21st
day.
9:00
the
next
morning,
his
answer
is
9
hours
late.
today,
i
submit
and
i
believe
that
in
most
jurisdictions
around
the
country,
most
district
judges
will
think
that
it's
in
the
exercise
of
their
discretion
to
allow
an
answer
to
be
filed
9
hours
late
rather
than
to
deprive
a
party
of
his
or
her
day
in
court
and
essentially
impose
a
windfall
to
the
plaintiff,
who
at
that
point
would
have
a
$6.9
million
default
judgment.
but
it
is
precisely
that
sort
of
exercise
of
discretion
that
the
petitioners
would
deprive
the
trial
courts
of
exercising
if
their
hard
and
fast,
inflexible
rule
is
accepted
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
that
completes
my
comments.
