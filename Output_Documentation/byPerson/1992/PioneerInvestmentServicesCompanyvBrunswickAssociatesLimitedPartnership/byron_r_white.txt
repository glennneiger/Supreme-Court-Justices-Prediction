justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
it's
rather
strange
to
talk
about
events
beyond
somebody's
control
when
you're
trying
to
define
excusable
neglect?
i
mean,
neglect
is
always...
is
never
beyond
your
control,
is
it?
that's
just
sort
of...
negligence.
is
that
ever
beyond
your
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
would
think
the
eleventh
circuit
definition
would
just...
how
could
you
ever
prove
that
neglect
was
beyond
your
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
just
say
it
isn't
excusable.
you
just...
what's
wrong
with
that?
and
let
the
courts
decide
whether
it's
excusable
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the...
the
court
below
didn't
even
ever
get
around
to
determining
whether
the
attorney's
error
was
excusable
or
not,
did
it?
i
mean,
they
just...
it
seemed
to
me
they
said
that
the
client,
the
creditor,
wasn't
neglectful,
it
was
his
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
the
question
should
have
been
whether
the
neglect
of
the
lawyer
was
excusable.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
one
of
the
three
errors
they
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
only
talked
about
one
so
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
hard...
i
suppose
it
would
be...
have
been
hard
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
excusable
neglect
when
the
attorney
just
up...
right
out
says
there's
no
hurry.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
he
ought
to...
he
should
know
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
hadn't
been
changed
lately,
had
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
neglected
his
legal
training.
that's
all.
you
just
neglected
to
say
that.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
to
win
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
blame
the
client,
they
didn't
stick
the
client
with
his
lawyer's
neglect,
and
therefore
did
not
decide
whether
the
lawyer
was
excusably
neglectful
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
rather
win
it
on
some
other
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
to
confine...
you
want
to
put
some
definition
into
excusable
neglect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
room
just
in
reading
the
language
to...
for
that,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
you
just
say
there's
neglect.
sure,
it's
neglect,
but
that
isn't
the
whole
story.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
entirely
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you
specifically.
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
client
shouldn't
be
blamed
for
the
negligence
of
his
or
its
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
didn't
really
inquire
whether
the
attorney's
negligence
was
excusable.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
attorney's
error
would
subject
him
to
a
malpractice
suit
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
not
really
talking
about
whether
it
was
just
a
human
error
in
the
sense
that
almost
anybody
would
make
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
want
to...
i
suppose
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
client,
and
if
you
want
to
impose
a
rule
that
this
is
excusable
if
it's
due
to
something...
some
act
beyond
your
control,
surely
in
this
case
the
negligence
of
his
lawyer
was
beyond
his
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whatever
damages
he
could
recover.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
or
whatever
damages
the
lawyer
could
pay
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
that
be
amended?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
court
set
a
file
date
and
then
change
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
will
indicate,
and
for
the
reasons
stated
therein,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justices
scalia,
souter
and
thomas
have
joined
that
opinion.
