mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
initially
clear
up
a
couple
of
issues
that
came
up
during
oral
argument
by
general
barnett.
first
of
all,
although
the...
an
interest
in
the
issue
is
understandable,
the
state's
jurisdiction
over
the
taken
lands
in
question
here,
be
they
fee
lands...
formerly
fee
lands
or
formerly
tribal
trust
lands,
is
not
at
issue.
the
district
court
denied
the
state
of
south
dakota
a
ruling
on
that
issue
because
they
failed
to
plead
it
in
their
complaint
or
to
put
on
a
case,
and
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
that
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
i'm
not
suggesting
the
court
should
not
think
about
the
issue,
but
it's
clear
that
the
court
need
not
decide
that
issue
today
because
it's
not
presented
here.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
state
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
the
taken
areas
in
question.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
issue
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
raises
a
number
of
issues.
it
should
be
clear
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
made
no
showing
that
its
interests
are
hurt
by
exclusive
tribal
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
shared
jurisdiction
of
the
taken
strip
of
land
would
not
impair
the
state's
wildlife
management.
in
the
past--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--in
the
state
and
the
tribe.
that
is
correct.
contrary--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--wildlife
management
program.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
what
was
at
issue
was...
when
the
district
court
made
those
findings
was,
in
addition
to
the...
it
was
reaffirming
its
decision
not
to
reach
the
issue
of
state
jurisdiction.
i
think
what
those
things
prove
is
that
concurrent
jurisdiction
will
work.
the
court
was...
although
it
was
not
addressing
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
state
or
even
whether
or
not
the
state
had
concurrent
jurisdiction,
it
recognized
that
one
cannot
really
think
about
the
issue
of
tribal
jurisdiction
over
this
land
without
at
least
thinking
about
whether
or
not
the
state
would
have
some
jurisdiction.
so,
it
made
those
findings
that
tribal
jurisdiction
over
this
territory
would
not
interfere
with
the
state's
wildlife
program
and
that
shared
jurisdiction
was
likewise
workable.
it
further
made
a
finding
that
despite
even
the
litigation
in
this
case,
the
actual
people
who
do
this
sort
of
management,
the
tribal
game
wardens
and
the
state's
game
wardens,
enjoy
an
amicable
relationship.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
absolutely
none.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
no,
justice
o'connor,
the
tribe
does
not.
we
believe
that
the
1954
taking
act,
which
is
the
relevant
legislation,
in
section
x,
requires
that
the...
or
rather
gives
the
federal
government
the
power
to
regulate
corresponding
use.
that
is,
it
reserves
hunting
and
fishing
rights
to
the
tribe,
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
as
the
operator
of
the
reservoir
area,
has
the
right
to
issue
regulations
governing
corresponding
use.
the
tribe
has
never
tried
since
it
became
a
taken
area
by
the
federal
government
to
exclude
others
from
it.
i
should
say,
however--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--no.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
no.
the
tribe
does
not
assert
the
right
to
exclude,
but
i
should
make
clear
that
in
this
case
that
does
not
mean
that
the
public
has
necessarily
a
right
of
access
to
it.
see,
the
point
of
the
taking
was
it
is
no
longer
tribal
trust
land,
or
rather
federal
land
held
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
it's
now
federal
land
held
for
the
reservoir
project.
what
that
means
is
that
the
army
corps
of
engineers
has
control
over
it,
and
although
section
4--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--given
that
this
is
federal
lands
and
that
one
normally
understands
that
there's
a
right
of
access
to
federal
lands,
the
tribe
does
not
believe
it
has
a
right
to
exclude
people
to
deny
them
essentially
passage
across
the
reservation.
that
would
be
a
difficult
matter
to
police
in
any
event
since
there
is
a
federal
highway,
among
other
things,
that
goes
across
tribal
trust
land
through
the
reservation
to
the
taken
area.
so,
the
tribe
is
not
making
an
effort
to
exclude
people
from
that
area.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
yes,
justice
scalia.
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act
does
require
that.
however,
that
does
not...
and
therefore,
the
tribe
believes
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
exclude.
what
i
wish
to
point
out,
though,
is
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--should
the
corps
of
engineers
decide
to
make
that
portion
of
lake
oahe
open
for
public
use,
which
is
an
issue
in
the
discretion
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
then
the
tribe
does
not
believe
it
has
the
power
to
exclude
people
from
it.
we
assert
here
only
the
limited
power
to
license
hunting
and
fishing
on
that
area
as
within
the
rest
of
the
reservation,
tribal
trust
land.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
well,
that
doesn't...
but
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
shall
be
free
of
all
fees
to
license...
i
mean,
to...
you
know,
don't
have
to
pay
a
license
fee
to
hunt
and
fish.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
we
do
not
believe
we
have
the
right
necessarily
to
exclude
people
from
the
area.
however,
the
tribe
has...
the
tribe
is
of
the
opinion
that
there
was
no
divestiture
of
the
power
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
in
the
area.
i
don't
think
that
necessarily--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--to
require
that
they
have
a
tribal
fishing
license.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
if
they
do
not
have
the
license.
correct.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
well,
to
begin
with,
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act
of
1944
is
most
directly
relevant
to
the
18,000
acres
of
land
within
this
swatch
of
territory
which
was
taken
from
fee
simple
owners.
we
do
not
know
how
that
land
came
to
be
held
in
fee.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
it
was
an
allotment
act
or
what.
we
simply
know
that
it
was
held
in
fee
by
nonmembers
of
the
tribe.
that
land
was
taken
by
the
government
through
eminent
domain
pursuant
to
the
flood
control
act.
however--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--yes.
yes,
the
united
states
took
it
in
fee.
however,
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act
is
not
the
only
section
of
the
act
that
is
relevant.
section
9
of
that
act
says
that
with
reference
to
the
irrigation
and
taking
of
indian
lands,
that
those
will
be
in
accord
with
indian
law.
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act
of
'44
merely
set
up
the
framework
during
which
the
entire
missouri
river
project
would
take
place.
section
9,
which
this
court
interpreted
in
the
etsi
pipeline
case
a
few
years
ago,
was
understood
to
be
that
which
harmonizes
the
flood
control
act
with
the
remaining
corpus
of
federal
law.
part
of
that
federal
law
is
indian
law,
which
says
that
you
cannot
take
indian
land
pursuant...
except
pursuant
to
certain
understandings.
that
is
why
the
1950
act
was
passed
to
try
and
enable
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government
to
come
to
a
negotiation.
when
negotiations
failed
to
reach
a
satisfactory
conclusion,
the
1954
cheyenne
river
act
was
passed.
that
is
the
act
pursuant
to
which
the
104,000
acres
of
former
tribal
trust
lands
were
taken.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
yes,
it
does,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
basis
for
that
is
precisely
because
the
government
has
taken
it.
this
is
now
land
owned
by
the
federal
government
for
the
purposes
of
a
federal
water
project.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
well,
the
federal
government
ceded
to
the
tribe
substantial
rights
over
this
entire
areas,
rights--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
tribe
has
the
power
to...
had
the
power
before
the
gates
of
the
dam
closed
to
condemn
or
salvage
any
of
the
improvements.
it
had
absolute
right
to
take
all
the
timber
regardless
of
what
property
it
was
on,
and
it
to
this
day
now
reserves
all...
was
reserved
to
this
tribe
the
power
to
graze
all
of
this
land
or
to
permit
other
people
to
graze
it
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
was
the
original
18,000
acres
or
the
104,000
acres.
since
it
is
all
federal
land,
the
fee
land
that
was
there
has
now
been
submerged
in
the
larger
federal
corpus,
and
the
tribe
exercises
authority
over
it
with
respect
to
mineral
rights,
grazing,
and
timber
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
was
originally
fee
land
or
tribal
trust
land.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
yes,
that
was
reserved
in
section,
i
believe,
x
of
the
flood
control...
of
the
cheyenne
river
act
of
1954.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
clear,
justice
white,
because
the
statute
reserves
the
right
to
license
and
permit
to
the
tribe.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
a
presence
here
in
this
case
because,
for
example,
the
tribal
grazing
code
is--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--yes.
that
is
because
the
corps
of
engineers
controls
the
public
access
to
the
water
projects.
the...
with
reference
to
the
land
in
this
case,
that
was
reserved
expressly...
the
grazing
rights
on
the
land
were
reserved
expressly
to
the
tribe,
and
there
was
a
comptroller
general
opinion
i
believe
in
1977
which
said
that
the
tribe
has
exclusive
authority
to
permit
grazing
on
this
land
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
originally
had
been
taken
from
fee
owner
or
whether
or
not
taken
in
trust
from
the
tribe.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
well,
in
every
instance,
somebody
has
to
regulate
the
hunting
and
fishing
in
these
circumstances.
the
state
of
south
dakota
certainly
has
no
authority
to
exclude
anyone
from
the
taken
area
or
from
any
other
federal
project.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
yes,
that
is
the
understanding.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
yes.
we
do
not
think
that
the
taking
of
the
federal...
by
the
federal
government
in
this
case
displaces
the
preexisting
regulatory
authority.
granted,
the
corps
of
engineers
reserves
the
right
to
regulate
corresponding
use,
but
the
practice
of
the
corps
has
been
to
allow
the
regulation
that
existed
theretofore.
if
it's
on
federal
land
and...
that
used
to
be
state
land,
the
state
exercises
it
in
cooperation
with--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--the
fish
and
game
wardens.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
found
within
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act
itself,
which
in
its
last
line
says
that
nothing
in
this
will...
and
it's
essentially
an
antipreemption
clause.
nothing
in
this
will
preempt
otherwise
applicable
state
laws
for
the
management
or
conservation
of
fish
and
game.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
it
is
the
understanding
of
the
federal...
and
there's
also
the
provision
in--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--well,
that
applies
with
respect
to
the
example
that
anybody
would
have
authority.
our
position
is
that
given
that
the
tribe
enjoyed
authority
to
regulate
this
land
beforehand,
that
the
federal
government
took
it
for
its
own
purposes
with
the
reservation
of
substantial
authority
to
the
tribe,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
cheyenne
river
act--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--there
is
an
express
reservation
of
a
right
to
hunt
and
fish,
which
is
not
exclusive.
other
people
are...
you
know,
can
enjoy
that
as
well.
however,
it
is
a
right
to
hunt
and
fish
which
is
not
the
same
as
merely
the
public's
right
of
access.
otherwise,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
preserve
it.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
simply
didn't
come
up.
both
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
there
was
nothing
in
either
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
which
addressed
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
congress
was
dealing
exclusively
with
the
property
rights.
it
is
the
basic
understanding
under
federal
law,
when
they
take
pursuant
to
title
40,
section
255,
that
the
preexisting
jurisdiction
over
that
land
is
not
disturbed.
in
this
case,
there
is
one
reference
in
the
legislative
history
and
one
reference
in
the
statute
which
seems
to
indicate
that
the
tribe
preserves
regulatory
power,
and
that
is
that
in
section
x
it
reserves
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
not
just
to
members
of
the
tribe
and
to
the
tribe,
but
to
the
tribal
council
and
members
of
said
tribe.
everywhere
else
in
the
cheyenne
river
act
where
the
congress
used
the
phrase
tribal
council,
it
refers
to
the
tribal
council
as
a
governing
body.
therefore,
something
must
be
meant
in
section
x
beyond
a
mere
right
to
hunt
and
fish
by
reserving
this
power
to
the
tribal
council.
if
we
are
to
read
it,
as
this
court
advised
last
week
in
mcgonsett
v.
samuels,
so
that
every
word
and
clause
of
the
statute
has
meaning,
then
tribal
council
must
mean
something
more
than
the
mere
right
to
hunt
and
fish
because
every
member
of
the
tribal
council
enjoyed
that
already
by
virtue
of
the
general
reference
to
a
reservation
of
powers
to
hunt
and
fish.
in
light
of
that,
the
one
place
in
the
legislative
history
that
addresses
the
right
to
jurisdiction
actually
occurred
in
a
colloquy
between
the
tribe's
representative
and
representative
berry,
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation,
the
day
after
the
conversation
that
general
barnett
referred
to.
and
in
that
instance,
the
tribe
said
that
it
read
section
x,
which
was
now
before
it
and
was
adopted
in
that
forum,
to
reserve
to
the
tribe
the
power
to
hunt
and
fish
and
to
regulate
the
taking
of
hunting
and
fish.
he
said
specifically
no
white
person
can
go
on
this
land
without
a
license
to
hunt
and
fish.
nothing
was
said
from
the
committee
or
anyplace
else
to
disturb
that
notion.
now,
that
isn't
a
whole
lot
on
which
to
go
on,
but
certainly
the
only
thing
in
the
statute
that
addresses
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
is
something
that
indicates
that
the
tribal
council
was
to
retain
some
power,
and
it
can't
be
merely
the
right
to
go
hunt
and
fish
en
masse.
it
must
mean
some
form
of
regulatory
power.
moreover--
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
that
the
tribe
would...
council
would
have
in
any
event
by
virtue
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
the
tribal
constitution,
and
that
would
have
been,
again,
an
unnecessary
reservation
of
right.
the
tribe
council
always
has
powers
over
its
members
because
it
is
a
sovereign,
at
least
in
that
limited
sense.
if
i
could
address
just
for
a
moment
the
basic
aspect
of
the
cheyenne
river
act,
what
distinguishes
it
and
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
montana
case,
which
is
the
most
relevant
on
point,
and
that
is
this
court,
when
it
addressed
the
similarly
narrow
regulatory
issue
of
tribal
power
over
nonmember
fee
land
in
montana,
said
that
one
must
look
at
tribal
power
over
land
in
light
of
the
subsequent
alienation
of
that
land.
in
this
case,
the
land
was
not
alienated
to
private
landowners,
to
homesteaders
in
fee
simple.
it
was
alienated
to
the
federal
government
with
a
reservation
of
substantial
rights
to
the
tribe,
and
that
is
the
second
issue.
that
is
the
scope
of
the
alienation.
nothing
was
retained
in
montana.
it
was
fee
simple.
here
the
tribe
retained
all
the
rights
that
we
have
discussed
including,
importantly,
the
right
to
graze
livestock
on
this
area
or
to
license
the
grazing
of
livestock,
which
is
important
because
that
is
where
this
litigation
arose.
the
tribe
was
concerned
about
hunters
coming
onto
reservation
land
because
this
area
is
indian
landlocked...
it
is
between
indian
land
exclusively
on
one
side
and
the
lake
on
the
other...
and
disturbing
the
herds
that
were
there,
leaving
open
the
fences,
disturbing
the
buffalo
herd
and
so
on.
mr.
brian
stuart
koukoutchos
in
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
tribe
did
not
do
nothing.
contrary
to
what
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
told
you,
the
district
court
found...
and
these
findings
are
at
joint
appendix,
page
65...
that
the
tribe
has
always
asserted
jurisdiction
over
this
taken
area
both
before
it
was
taken
and
since
1954.
it
has
never
acquiesced
in
state
jurisdiction,
and
that
the
jurisdictional
matrix
which
has,
in
fact,
ensued
is
that
the
tribe
enforces
its
tribal
fishing
and
hunting
regulations
against
all,
including
nonmembers,
on
the
taken
land;
whereas
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
limited
its
enforcement
to
nonmembers.
those
are
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
they
are
not
disturbed.
in...
moreover,
if
i
can
get
back
to...
strictly
with
respect
to
the
grazing,
it
gave
the
grazing,
which
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
land.
because
it
is
done
pursuant
to
the
tribal
grazing
code,
the
district
court
found
that
it
gives
the
tribal
land
a
distinct
indian
flavor
because
it
is
criss-crossed
by
fences
setting
up
these
areas.
that
code
is
enforced
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
and
in
fact,
the
entire
area
has
a
pervasive
federal
presence.
the
tribal
regulation
is
subject
to
oversight
by
the
corps
of
engineers,
but
not
by
the
state.
the
enforcement
of
tribal
regulations
in
accord
with
tribal
ordinance
no.
3
have
always
included
the
availability
of
federal
enforcement.
all
tribal
fishing
and
hunting
regulations
and
ordinances
are
initially
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
