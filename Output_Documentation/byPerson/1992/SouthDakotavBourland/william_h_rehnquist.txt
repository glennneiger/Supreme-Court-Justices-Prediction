general
barnett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
used
to...
did
it
used
to
be
part
of
the
cheyenne
river
indian
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
checkerboard
situation
on
the
reservation
where
the
holdings
of
fee
land
and
reservation
are
kind
of
like
a
checkerboard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
bear
on
the
legal
issues
involved
in
this
case,
general
barnett?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
that
bear
because
of
some
statute
or
some
case
from
this
court?
i
mean,
how
do
you
tie
that
fact
into
the
established
law
regulating
this
subject?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
barnett,
they
could
have
had...
thought
they
had
jurisdiction
before,
but
simply
decided
that,
as
a
matter
of
comity,
they
would
honor
the
state
hunting
license.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
shape
of
the
property,
general
barnett?
is
it
a
kind
of
a
long,
narrow
tract
running
along
the
river?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say...
you
said
that
the
river
is
2.16
miles
wide.
is
that
what
you
meant
to
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we're
talking
about
duck
hunting
or...
i
mean,
are
we
talking
about
hunting
from
dry
land
or
from
in
the
river?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
a
land
is
there,
say,
from
the
regular
bank-full
level
of
the
river
to
the
edge
of
the
condemned
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
are
we
talking
about
several
hundred
feet,
several
hundred
yards,
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
it
extends
for
a
long
distance
along
the
river
channel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
tribe
isn't
asserting
any
claim
to
regulate
hunting
on
what
used
to
be
fee
land,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
barnett.
mr.
koukoutchos,
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
again,
what
issue
is
it
you
say
that
is
not
before
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
state
had
concurrent
jurisdiction,
would
that
mean
that
the
tribe
would
have
to
recognize
a
state
hunting
license?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
shared
jurisdiction
between
the
state
and
the
tribe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
not
impair
the
state's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
that
was,
in
the
view
of
the
district
court,
something
that
would
argue
in
favor
of
shared
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
any
part
of
those
findings
of
the
district
court
reversed
by
the
eighth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
taken
in
fee?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
the
tribe
claim
the
right
to
exclude
without
a
license
from
the
previously
fee
lands
that
were
taken,
the
private
lands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
basis
for
that
claim
since
the
government
has
taken
a
fee
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
why
does
that
give
the
tribe
a
right
to
demand
a
fishing
license
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
the
lands
taken
in
fee
from
the
private
owners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
tribe
do
nothing
for
30
years
if
it
had
these
concerns?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
koukoutchos.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
an
incredibly
muddled
situation
that
your
answer
suggests.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can't
tell
from
that
regulation
whether
state
and
local
laws...
whether
it
gives
the
nod
to
the
state
or
the
tribe
because
both
hunting
laws
are
covered
by
those...
that
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
the
federal
government
is
quite
willing
to
see
that...
see
both
of
them
exact
a
license
so
far
as
the
federal
interest
is
concerned.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
barnett,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
barnett.
the
case
is
submitted.
