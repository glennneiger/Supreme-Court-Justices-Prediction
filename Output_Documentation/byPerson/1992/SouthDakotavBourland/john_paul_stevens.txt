does
that
mean...
just
so
i...
does
that
mean
that
the
area
in
dispute
is
now
within
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
brought
it
here,
but
it
was
decided
below
that
there
was
no
diminishment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
appeal.
ergo,
we
have
to
accept
the
case
as
coming
to
us
with
this
territory
being
within
the
reservation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
how
can
that
all
survive
the
provision
in
section
4
that
the
water
areas
shall
be
open
to
public
use
generally
without
charge
for
boating,
swimming,
bathing,
fishing,
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and...
i'm
sorry.
i
just
assume
it
means
without
charge
by
the
federal
government.
