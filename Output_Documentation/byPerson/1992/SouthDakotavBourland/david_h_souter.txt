justice
david
h.
souter
general
barnett,
am
i
correct
that
you
have
taken
or
you
have
represented
to
us
that
the
only
regulation
to
which
the
state
has
consented
in
the
past,
basically
by
agreement
i
guess,
has
been
regulation
of
indians
on
the
reservation
lands,
as
distinguished
from
nontribal
members?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
claim
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
claim
was
subject
to
the
remand
order,
wasn't
it,
below?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
montana
dealing
only
with
fee
land?
in
other
words,
there's
some
broad
language
in
montana,
but
the
issue
in
montana
only
concerned
fee
land,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
the
text
of
the
'54
act.
what's
the...
in
addition
to
the
text,
what's
the
best
indication
that
it
was
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
that
it
was
sort
of
buying
out
the
regulatory
authority?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
know
that
they
got
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
know
that
they
got
that
compensation?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
it
one
thing
to
lose
wildlife,
which
you
can't
take
for
its
economic
value,
and
quite
a
different
thing
to
lose
the
authority
to
exclude
others
who
may,
subject
to
your
regulatory
authority,
come
in
and
hunt
and
fish
for
the
wildlife?
and
to
lose
the
wildlife,
i
mean,
you
know,
a
deer
cannot
live
on
submerged
land.
we
understand
that,
but
that's
a
different
thing
from
losing
the
regulatory
authority
over
that
land
or
even
over
the
water
that
takes
its
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
montana
make
it
clear
that
that
power
to
exclude
is
lost
with
respect
to
anything
other
than
fee
land?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
were
the...
did
the
terms
of
the
ballot
refer
in
any
way
to
the
extinction
of
regulatory
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
i
take
you
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
and
as
i
understand
his
question,
it
doesn't
depend,
it
doesn't
implicate
any
of
these
reservations
of
rights
that
you
have
been
describing
here.
it
implicates
simply
the
general
provisions
for
the
governance
of
lands
taken
in
fee
by
the
corps
or
by
the
united
states
for
corps
of
engineers
projects,
and
it
guarantees
public
access.
and
his
question
is...
for
fishing.
as
i
understand
it,
his
question
is
if
the
public
has
access
for
fishing,
where
do
you
get
the
authority
to
charge
a
fee
in
the
absence
of
which
you
can
exclude
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you.
let
me
ask
you
a
variant
on
the
question,
which
doesn't
perhaps
go
to
its
point,
but
may
be
suggestive.
is
it...
do
you
know
whether,
in
fact,
in
other
project
areas
which
would
be
subject
to
this
same
statute,
but
not
involving
tribal
lands,
whether
the
states
involved
have
or
at
least
exercise
a
regulatory
authority
over
it
so
that
they
would,
in
effect,
find
someone
for
fishing
on
a
corps
of
engineers
lake
without
a
state
hunting
license?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so,
your
claim
is
that
the
tribe
in
this
case
is
doing
no
more
than
the
states
would
normally
do
under
their
hunting
and
fishing
regulatory
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
you
just
looked--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
but
if
you
just
looked
at
the
text
of
the
statute
and
not...
and
made
no
reference
to
this
state
practice,
it
would
be
a
legitimate
question
then
as
to
whether
there
would
be
any
basis
on
corps
project
lands
and
waters
for
any
authority,
at
least
other
than
the
united
states,
to...
well,
no,
strike
the
proviso.
there
would
be
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
any
authority
could
preclude
anyone
from
fishing
subject
to
the
payment
of
a
fee.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
won't
help
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
have
express
reservations
of
grazing
rights
and
timber
rights
and
so
on,
but
you
have
no
express
reservation
of
this
regulatory
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
was
regulatory
power
over
tribal
members.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
be
it
was
just
regulatory
power
over
tribal
members.
