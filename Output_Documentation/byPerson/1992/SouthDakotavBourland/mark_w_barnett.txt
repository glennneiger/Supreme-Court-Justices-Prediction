mr.
mark
w.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1944,
congress
recognized
that
there
was
a
need
to
bring
the
massive
missouri
river
under
control.
they
passed
the
flood
control
act
at
that
time
which
was
to
authorize
the
construction
of
reservoirs
and
dams
and
to
convert
that
river
to
public
beneficial
uses.
by
1954,
that
scheme
had
resulted
in
the
entry
into
an
agreement
between
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
tribe
and
the
government
that
for
a
sum
certain,
all
lands,
interests,
claims,
demands,
et
cetera,
in
the
affected
property
would
be
conveyed
in
fee
simple
or
in
fee
title
to
the
united
states
subject,
however,
to
certain
conditions,
quote,
hereinafter
set
forth,
end
quote.
the
treaty
underlying
this
dispute
is
the
treaty
of
1868
which,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
is
indistinguishable
from
the
treaty
that
this
court
considered
in
montana
v.
u.s.
some
12
years
ago.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether,
in
light
of
that
alienation
of
land
under
the
act,
whether
or
not
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
tribe
somehow
retained
regulatory
authority
over
nonmembers
on
what
was
now
and
is
now
public
land.
to
answer
that
question--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor,
and
the...
i
should
say
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
reservation
jutted
out
into
the
mid-channel,
quote,
unquote,
of
the
river,
and
that
reservation
boundary
is
still
there
at
this
time
out
into
the
water
somewhere.
the
reservation
is
approximately
2
million--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--there
is...
the
issue...
we
have
not
brought
the
issue
before
the
court
today
of
diminishment,
and--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--that's--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
i
should
state,
as
a
way
of
factual
background,
that
there
are
some
2,800,000
acres
in
this
reservation.
approximately
1,400,000,
or
half
of
the
reservation,
has
been
alienated
out
to
non-indian
fee
ownership.
and
it's
particularly
important
in
this
analysis
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
that
the
strip
of
take
land
that
was
along
that
western
side
of
the
missouri
river
and
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
reservation
included
not
only
100,000...
104,000
acres
of
tribal
land,
but
also
18,000
acres
of
non-indian
fee
land.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
it
is
interspersed.
i
think
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
the
majority
of
the
fee
land
on
the
reservation
is
towards
the
northwest
corner,
or
away
from
the
river.
however,
again,
as
i
mentioned,
the
other
portion
of
fee
land
that
had
taken
place
in
this
reservation
prior
to
the
taking
was
along
that
river,
some
18,000
acres.
and
so,
there's
really
two
areas
where
fee
land
had
come
into
being,
and
then
between
those,
slightly
removed
from
the
river
and
in
many
places
directly
along
the
river,
was
still
fee
land.
so,
yes,
there
was
interspersing.
since
the
gates
of
this
dam
have
closed
and
the
water
has
arisen,
the
tribe
has
not
sustained--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--it
does
not
anymore.
it
did
originally.
the
courts
below
have
found
and
the
tribe
has
basically
conceded
that
as
to
the
fee
lands
not
in
the
take
area,
that
they
were
no
longer
claiming
jurisdiction.
however,
they
had
originally
in
the
declaration
in
'88
that
caused
us
to
go
to
court.
the
tribe
has
not
sustained,
quote,
an
independent
and
vigorous
scheme
of
wildlife
management
on
this
reservation,
and
i
quote
from
the
government's
brief
at
page
6.
the
district
court
found...
and
i
quote...
the
tribe,
meanwhile,
does
very
little
game
management.
end
quote.
the
tribe
admitted
through
its
game,
fish,
and
park
director
at
trial...
this
is
in
your
joint
appendix
at
379...
that
the
tribe
does
not
do
any
management
on
the
missouri
river
and
does
not
even
have
a
plan
for
fishery
management.
and
that
is
at
381.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
the
tribe
has...
for
a
period
of
some
30
years,
your
honor,
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
vigorously
managed
all
of
this
public
property
and
assumed
jurisdiction
over
all
of
this
area,
both
the
take
land,
whether
it
was
previously
indian
land
or
whether
it
was
previously
fee
land
by
non-indians,
as
well
as
all
the
waters.
we
have
asserted
and
maintained
and
exercised
jurisdiction
and
management
of
that
asset,
and
the
tribe
has
not.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
think
that
it
is
the
most
compelling
evidence
of
how
all
of
the
parties
to
this
entire
transaction
have
construed
the
'54
act.
the
'54
act
made
it
quite
clear
that
all
interests,
all
lands
were
to
be
conveyed
to
the
public,
to
the
government,
and
that
is
in
section
i,
except
for
such
conditions
are
set
forth
in
the
act.
section
ii
again
suggests
all
interests,
not
just
the
land,
but
the
interests,
were
being
conveyed
to
the
public.
and
last,
but
not
least,
section
x,
which
was
drafted
by
the
tribe
itself
and
adopted
by
congress
in
the
form
submitted
by
the
tribe,
the
tribe
was...
treaty
rights
were
to
be
limited
in
the
future
to
access.
whereas
before,
but
for
the
navigational
servitude,
they
might
have
claimed
that
they
had
control
under
section
x,
they
were
reduced
to
a
position
of
access...
and
i
quote...
subject,
however,
to
regulations
governing
the
use
by
other
citizens
of
the
united
states.
and
so,
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
for
30
years,
we
have
read
that
act
to
say
just
what
it...
to
mean
just
what
it
says,
that
the
tribe
had
lost
the
power
to
exclude.
and
i
might
point
out
in
that
contention
that
the
tribe
lost
the
power
to
exclude
that
section
4
of
the
'44
act,
which
authorized
the
entire
process,
specifically
said
that
no
use
of
these
areas
shall
be
allowed
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
game
and
fish
laws
of
the
state
in
which
the
area
is
situated.
we
read
that
to
mean
just
what
it
sounds
like
it
says,
that
the
state
game
laws
will
be
in
control
in
these
areas.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
we
have
conceded
and
we
do
concede
today
that
the
tribe
is
in
charge
of
game
problems,
game
management,
and
so
forth
even
as
to
nonmembers
on
tribal
trust
lands,
the
lands
that
they
still
have
the
power
to
exclude
from.
but
we
have
contended
that
as
to
those
areas,
that
they
cannot
exclude.
they
have
lost
the
power
to
regulate.
i
might
add
that...
and
i
would
suggest
that
it's
in
deference
to
the
citizens
who
are
tribal
members...
we
also
are
not
contending
today
that...
or
rather,
we
are
conceding
that
the
tribe
can
regulate
that
activity
of
its
own
members
out
on
this
public
property.
we're
not
even
arguing
that
point,
but
only
that
we
are
regulating
the
activity
of
nonmembers
on
this
public
property.
we...
i
should
point
out
that,
just
so
you...
if
i
may
cover
briefly
what
the
state
has
done
in
the
way
of
exercising
that
jurisdiction.
we
have
what
the
district
court
found
was
a
pervasive
law
enforcement,
end
quote,
presence
on
all
of
these
public
properties.
we
have
initiated
a
comprehensive
and
substantial
wildlife
and
fishery
management
program.
we've
stocked
72
million
fish
out
in
this
asset,
including
stocking
fish
along
the
area
that
once
was
tribal
land.
we've
monitored,
managed.
we
have
an
endangered
species
plan.
we
have
what
the
court
basically
recognized.
we
have
developed,
and
i
might
add
we've
developed
in
partnership
with
the
federal
government.
we
have
developed
what
is
now,
in
the
words
of
the
district
court,
a
nationally
recognized
fishery
with
regard
to
certain
game
fishes.
you
might
ask...
and
i
think
it's
a
fair
question...
if
the
state
has
exercised
jurisdiction
for
30
years,
and
the
tribe
has
not,
which
is
clearly
what
the
district
court
found,
then
how
did
we
get
to
this
dispute?
in
1988,
the
state
attempted
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
tribe
with
regard
to
the
taking
of
deer,
not
just
on
the
public
property
and
not
just
on
the
reservation,
but
in
effect,
a
joint
opportunity
for
hunters
to
buy
one
license,
split
the
revenue
between
the
entities,
and
allow
the
hunter
to
go
where
the
game
is
without
respect
to
jurisdictional
boundaries.
that...
those
negotiations
broke
down
when
the
tribe
insisted
that
before
nonmembers
could
hunt
on
that
public
property,
they
would
have
to
have
tribal
permission.
we
could
not
accede
to
that
demand,
and
so
at
that
time,
negotiations
broke
off.
and
the
tribe
then
publicly
announced...
and
i'll
quote
the
tribe's
brief.
quote,
the
tribe
announced
its
intentions
to
enforce
tribal
hunting
and
fishing
regulations
on
the
taken
area.
that's
at
page
14.
and
the
announcement
that
they
used
was,
quote,
all
hunters
must
now
hold
a
tribal
hunting
license
to
hunt
on
any
and
all
lands
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
the
state
license
will
no
longer
be
honored.
end
quote.
and
yet,
the
tribe
comes
before
you
today
and
suggests
that
they've
had
jurisdiction
and
exercised
jurisdiction
for
all
those
years.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
if
they
have,
why
did
they
need
to
go
with
a
public
announcement
suggesting
that
now
you
must
have
a
tribal
license
to
hunt
on
these
public
lands?
i
would
submit
to
the
court
as
well--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
think
that
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
tribe
thought
was
the
fact
that
for
some
30
years
they
had
not
made
any
actual...
they
had
had
a
regulation
in
i
believe
the
'30's
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
that
suggested
or
that
they
claimed
gave
them
jurisdiction
over
these
nonmember
activities.
however,
no
enforcement
efforts
at
any
time...
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
tribe's
brief,
footnote
17,
where
they
say
in
the
single
tribal
court
action
on
record
against
a
nonmember,
one
action
in
all
those
years.
and
that's
a
reference
to
a
1990
case
after
this
litigation
began.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
would
submit
first
under
rosebud
v.
kneip,
the
principle
that
this
court
suggested,
another
case
coming
out
of
south
dakota,
that
when
the
state
has
exercised
jurisdiction
for
so
many
years,
without
objection
through
those
years
from
the
government
or
the
tribe,
that
this
can
create
jurisdictional
expectations
and
that
it
also
is
good
evidence
of
how
the
parties
construe
the
law.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
would
submit
that
the...
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
federal
government
has
the
right
to
regulate
this
property,
and
probably
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
but
it's
also...
i
think
it's
also
pertinent
that
the
corps
has
worked
with
us
through
all
these
years.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
think
that's
an
additional
source,
and
i
think
a
source
even
earlier
than
that
is
section
4
of
the
'44
act,
which
made
it
clear
this
was
to
be
opened
up
to
the
public
for
boating,
recreation,
fishing,
and
so
forth.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
think
there's
also--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--a
principle
that
runs
through
the
cases
of
this
court
that
the
powers
not
exercised
by
the
federal
government,
and
particularly
with
regard
to
navigable
waterways,
are
reserved
to
the
state.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
would
submit
that
that
is
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
the
court
below
thought
otherwise.
i
would
refer
you
to
the
district
court
comment
in
its
decision
where
it
said
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
montana
v.
u.s.--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
think
it
was
a
recognition
of
the
concept
that
jurisdiction
over
these
waterways,
to
the
extent
not
used
by
the
federal
government,
should
remain
in
the
states.
and
in
fact,
during
the
discussion
of
the
ownership
of
the
bed,
the
court
noted
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
which
made
it
very
clear
in
that
case
that
montana
owned
the
bed
and
that
there
were
certain
inherent
sovereignty
sorts
of
rights
that
reserved
to
the
state
for
the
management
of
that
water.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that,
your
honor,
although
perhaps
the
other
side
would--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--we--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--we
contend
that
they
can
neither
exclude
from
this
property
nor
regulate
the
nonmembers
that
come
on
this
property,
and
that
is
what
the
montana--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--no,
they
cannot.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
there
was
testimony
by
the
tribal
chairman
that,
yes,
if
they
wanted
to,
they
could
exclude
nonmembers
from
this
public
property.
however,
they
have
not
made
the
effort...
as
the
district
court
found,
they
have
not
at
any
time
in
the
last
30
years
either
attempted
to
monitor
nonmember
access
to
this
property,
nor
have
they
made
any
effort
to
exclude.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
it
is...
the
river
is,
according
to
the
u.s.
geological
survey,
2.16
miles
wide
on
average,
and
something
over
200
miles
long.
and
so,
if
you
were
to
analogize
to...
because
it
is
a
navigable
waterway...
to
analogize
it
to
highways,
it
would
be
a
2-mile
wide
highway,
something
like
200
miles
long.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes.
the
river
is
on
average
2
miles
wide.
the
original
jurisdictional
line
of
the
reservation
juts
out
into
the
mid-channel
somewhere.
so--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--all
of
the
above.
there's
dry
land
hunting
for
deer
and
game
birds.
the
land--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
would
call
it
a
narrow
strip.
it
basically
is
that
amount
of
land
that
the
corps
wanted
to
reserve
so
that
if
there
were
several
years
of
heavy
rain,
that
they
would
not
go
above
the
take--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--it
varies
anywhere
from
a
couple
hundred
feet
to
several
hundreds
of
yards.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
all
along
the
edge
of
the
reservation,
as
i
say,
some
of
which
was
fee
land
and
some
of
which
was
not.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
they
are.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
they
are.
now--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes,
it
is.
and
the...
when
i
say
fee
land--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
when
i
say
the
fee
land,
i
am
referring
specifically
to
the
fee
land
which
was
fee
land
before
the
take,
in
other
words,
the
non-indian
property
that
was
along
that
edge
of
the
river
that
was
taken
along
with
the
indians'
land
along
the
edge.
the
fee
land
off
in
other
parts
of
the
reservation,
the
50
percent,
they
are
not
at
this
time
any
longer--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--contending
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
they
had
passed
regulations.
they
had
not
ever
enforced,
and
in
fact,
as
early
as
1952,
as
exhibit
213
reflects,
the
state
was
exerting
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
and
i
think
that
the
fairest
way
to
categorize
that
is
that--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--they're
not
making
that
claim
as
to
the
fee
land.
as
to
the
take
area,
which
included
some
fee
land,
yes,
they
were
contending
and
do
contend
today
that
they
have
jurisdiction
over
that.
and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
had
there
never
been
a
1954
act
to
come
along
and
to
expressly
remove
all
interests
of
the
tribe
as
to
this
property,
even
then,
under
the
navigational
servitude
that
this
court
has
talked
about
in
montana
and
in
other
cases,
would
suggest
that
they
have
lost
the
power
to
exclude
these
nonmembers.
and
these
nonmembers,
once
the
power
to
exclude
them
is
lost,
the
court
in
montana
and
in
brendale
has
made
clear
that
the
tribe
also
loses
with
it
the
right
to
regulate
those--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--it...
that's
correct.
it
is
fee
land
that
was
in
that
dispute.
and
that
turns
to
the
tribe
and
the
government's
argument
i
suspect
that
montana
and
brendale,
montana
in
particular,
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
on...
in
montana
turned
upon
the
intent
of
the
allotment
acts.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that
is
an
excessively
broad
reading
of
footnote
9.
i
think
that
their
case
hinges
upon
their
understanding
of
footnote
9,
which
talked
about
the
allotment
act
intent
of
disestablishing
these
reservations,
and
that
that
intent
was
opposite
to
the
concept
of
exclusivity
and
regulation.
i
would
submit,
however...
and
i
would...
in
fact,
i
would
quote
the
final
sentence
in
footnote
9
in
the
montana
case.
but
what
is
relevant
in
this
case
is
the
effect
of
the
land
alienation
occasioned
by
that
policy.
in
other
words,
what
the
court
was
saying
is
that
whatever
the
intent
of
the
allotment
act,
or
in
this
case
under
the
cheyenne
river
act
to
open
it
up
to
the
public,
whatever
the
intent,
the
effect
is
what's
important.
even
though
the
indian
reorganization
act
repudiated
the
intent
of
the
allotment
act,
nonetheless,
the
effect
was
still
the
same.
this
land
had
gone
out
of
the
indian
domain.
they
had
lost
the
power
to
exclude.
and
so,
our
contention
is
that
just
the
same
under
the
'54
act,
not
to
mention
navigational
servitudes,
under
the
'54
act,
they
lost
that
power
to
exclude.
and
so
it
is,
as
the
district
court
said,
indistinguishable.
i
don't
think
it
matters
who
owns,
whether
in
montana
the
state
owned
the
bed,
or
in
this
case,
although
it's
not
entirely
clear
perhaps,
probably
the
federal
government
owns
the
bed
in
this
case.
in
either
event,
what's
important
is
that
the
tribe
does
not,
and
as
a--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--and
as
a
consequence
of
not
owning
that
property
and
not
being
able
to
exclude,
they
also
can't
control
it.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
tribe
stems
from
its
treaty
rights
under
the
same
identical...
basically
identical
treaty
of
1868.
and
in
the
discussion
on
those
treaty
rights,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
congressional
record,
15609,
where
representative
case...
and
this
is
in
our
briefs...
said...
and
i
quote...
hunting
and
fishing
rights
were
also
a
part
of
the
rights
recognized
by
treaty,
and
to
the
extent
these
may
be
impaired
or
destroyed,
the
tribe
is
entitled
to
compensation
apart
from
settlement
with
the
allottees
holding
individual
tracts
of
land.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
pardon?
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
we
do.
there
was
a
payment
of
something
over
a
million
dollars
for
the
loss
of
all
wildlife.
and
there
was
testimony
by
a
mr.
lebeau
on
behalf
of
the
tribe,
and
his
comment
was...
and
i
quote...
the
value
of
this
loss
of
wildlife
resources
was
placed
at
74,300
annually.
because
of
the
fact
that
we
are
losing
these
resources
forever,
we
have
capitalized
that
sum
at
4
percent.
and
then
he
was
asked
by
one
of
the
members
of
congress
do
you
really
think
you're
going
to
lose
all
the
wildlife
forever,
and
he
affirmed
yes.
so--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--if
i
understand
your
question,
i
would
respond
that
clearly
montana
suggested
that
when
that
power
to
exclude
is
gone,
so
is
the
power
to
regulate.
and
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
it
was
with
regard
to
fee
land.
that
is
correct.
what
we
are
submitting
is
that
whether
it's
a
fee
that's
held
by
the
government
or
a
fee
that's
held
by
nonmembers,
in
either
case,
the
result
is
the
same.
it
has
gone
out
of
the
power
to
exclude.
they
stem
from
the
treaty.
and
in
this
case,
there
is
ample
congressional
history
that
they
knew
they
were
dealing
with
treaty
rights,
treaty
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
as
i've
said,
with
representative
case.
and
also
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
the
tribe
insisted
in
the
negotiations...
they
were
paid
by
congress
to
negotiate,
including
attorney
fees,
as
appears
in
section
xiii.
and
in
those
negotiations,
the
tribe
demanded
that
the
1868
treaty
requirement
that
any
acts
affecting
their
reservation
be
approved
by
three-quarters
of
the
adult
population...
they
insisted
that
the
congress
adhere
to
that,
and
the
congress
did
adhere
to
that.
and
this
whole
sale,
if
you
will,
went
out
to
the
members
in
1955
and
was
approved
by--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--they
did
not
expressly
talk
about
extinction
of
regulatory
power
even
though
no
such
regulatory
power
was
being
asserted
at
that
time.
what
the
ballot
did
say,
if
i
can
find
it
in
my
notes,
the
ballot
said
the
indians
may
graze
livestock
on
the
part
of
the
land
not
flooded
and
may
hunt
and
fish
in
the
taken
area
without
charge.
i
think
that
that
suggests
that
they
read
it
just
the
way
we
read
section
x
of
the
1954
act.
they
have
access
to
hunt
and
fish.
and
in
fact,
what
they
are
seeking
today
is
not
access
to
the
fish,
but
access
to
the
fishers.
with
that,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
not
sure
what
part
of
the
record
that
counsel
for
the
government
is
referring
to
in
regard
to
a
corps
interpretation,
but
i
will
say
that
the
record
does
reflect
in
1976
a
letter
from
the
corps
to
the
lower
brule
tribe,
which
is
on
the
same
river
just
down
river,
suggesting
that
their
ordinances
did
not
have
effect
over
the
take
area.
i
would
submit
the...
a
letter
of
september
of
1986
from
the
corps
to
our
game,
fish
and
parks
department,
which
is
at
joint
appendix
288.
quote,
the
position
of
the
corps
has
always
been
that
the
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
on
corps
land
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
this
was
clearly
the
intent
of
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act.
and
again,
as
we
have
said,
section
4
of
the
flood
control
act
says
no
use
of
these
properties
will
be
permitted
which
is
inconsistent
with
state
game
laws.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
there
is
a
cite
to.8,
which
is
in
the
tribal
brief,
and
we
do
not
agree
with
the
interpretation
that
state
or
local
regulations
would
include
tribal.
as
this
court
has
said
in
a
variety
of
cases,
the
attempt
by
a
tribe
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers
on...
non-indians
on
non-indian
land
will
be
viewed
narrowly.
in
contrast,
the
court
has
also
had
a
line
of
cases
that
expressed
the
concept
of
the
state
sovereignty
which
exists
to
the
extent
not
taken
up
or
preempted
by
federal
law.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
they
might,
although
i
would
submit
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
section
4
of
the
act
which
clearly
contemplates--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--and
that
is
the
problem
with
shared
jurisdiction,
and
i
might
add
that
the
findings
that
were
referred
to
by
the
tribe
in
the
district
court,
those
findings
about
shared
jurisdiction
were
in
the...
were
in
a
ruling
on
the
preliminary
injunction
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
show
irreparable
injury
pending
litigation.
i...
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
thank
you.
