counsel,
does
the
tribe
take
the
position
that
it
has
the
right
to
exclude
all
nontribal
members
from
access
to
the
lake
and
the
adjacent
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
separate
question,
whether
they've
actually
tried.
i'm
asking
whether--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
want
to
assert
the
right
to
exclude.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
tribe
assert
that
it
can
exclude
people
from
coming
through
the
reservation
to
reach
the
area
in
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
mr.
feldman,
it
is
clear
i
suppose
that
under
the
act
the
tribe
did
not
retain
the
power
to
exclude
people
from
public
uses
of
the
park
area
and
the
river--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
reservoir.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
can
camp
and
fish
and
use
it
presumably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
tribe
exclude
people
from
coming
onto
that
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
pretty
close
to
it.
if
you
don't
have
a
license,
you
can't
use
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--since
the
act
was
so
specific,
isn't
it
rather
odd
that
it
didn't
cover
this
aspect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
the
federal
government
would
have
the
right
to
require
hunting
and
fishing
licenses
from
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the
federal
government
could
require
licensing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
meaning
of
the
language
giving
the
states
whatever
regulatory
authority--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
barnett,
if
the
corps
of
engineer
regulation
were
very
specific
and
expressly
said
state
and
tribal
regulation,
would
they
have
the
authority
to
permit
joint
regulation
then?
