mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address...
first,
to
make
it
clear
the
land
that
we're
talking
about.
there
are
about
104,000
acres
of
land
here
that
were
taken
in
1954
by
the
federal
government
that
formerly
had
been
trust
lands.
what
happened,
when
the
land
was
taken,
was
the
land
continued
in...
title
continued
in
the
united
states
as
it
had
been
held
before,
but
whereas
before
it
was
held
for
the
beneficial
use
of
the
indians,
after
1954,
the
bundle
of
sticks
was
divided
up
a
little
bit
differently.
after
1954,
the
federal
government
got
title
to
that
land
and
got
all
the
uses
of
the
land
that
were
essential
for
its
purposes
of
flood
control
and
irrigation
and
for
the
secondary
purposes
for
which
the
corps
of
engineers
runs
these
projects.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
like
swimming,
picnicking,
camping--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--fishing.
it's
true,
hunting,
all
sorts
of
other
purposes
that
once
the
federal
government
has
the
land,
it
sets
it
aside
for
the
purposes
of.
however,
significant...
and,
in
fact,
all
of
the
other
economically
viable
uses
of
the
land
that
remained
were
in
the
indians.
and
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
look
at
what
happened
here
as
the
indians
being
left
with
only
a
bear
vestige
or
a
very
minor
amount
of
rights
in
these
lands.
as
has
been
pointed
out,
they
have
a
right
to
graze
cattle
on
all
of
the
land.
they
have
the
right
to
remove
timber.
they
have
mineral
rights
not
only
in
the
land,
but
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--exclusive
rights
to
graze
cattle.
that's
right.
they
have
exclusive
rights
to
remove
the
timber
up
till
this
day.
they
have
the
mineral
rights,
both
in
the
land
and
under
the
water.
i
think
that
those
circumstances
distinguish
this
case
from
montana
to
a
great
extent.
in
montana,
the
court
held
that
the
continued
exercise
of
tribal
jurisdiction
depends
on
the...
must
be
seen
in
light
of
the
subsequent
alienation
of
the
land.
in
montana,
the
purpose
of
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
what
i
would
say
about
exclusion
is
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they
can't
keep
people
off
altogether,
but
to
impose
a
licensing
fee
basically
for
the
benefits
that
the
people
are
getting
from
using
the
facilities
on
the
land
is
different
from
excluding
them
altogether.
and
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
if
the
licensing
fee
were
prohibitively
high
or
unusual
in
some
way
in
which
i
don't
think
it
is
in
this
case,
or
if
other
tribal
regulations
in
some
way
essentially
force
nonmembers
not
to
use
the
land,
then
i
think
those
would
be
preempted
by
the
flood
control
act
and
by
the
federal...
the
fact
that
the
federal
government--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
1954
act?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
the
1954
act
was
a
division
of
the
property
rights
in
the
land,
of
the
bundle
of
sticks
of
ownership
of
that
land
as
to
who
got
what
uses
after
that.
i
don't
think
that
anyone...
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
district
court-and
the
court
of
appeals
said.
i
don't
think
anyone
was
thinking
about
continuing
regulatory
authority
over
the
land.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
actually,
i
think
that
with...
it
may
be
a
little
bit
of
a
complex
answer.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
water
areas,
i
think
the
corps
would
have
a
hard
time
trying
to
force
people
to
obtain,
say,
some
kind
of
federal
license
to
go
fishing
in
light
of
the
language
that
says
that
people
shall
be
able
to
do
that
without
charge.
i
think
that
was
directed
at
the
corps'
authority
as
to
the...
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
with
this
land
and
how
it
was
supposed
to
make
it
open
for
recreational
purposes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
but
i
do
think
outside...
i
think
aside
from
that
one
proviso,
i
think
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
land
area
and
with
respect
to
other
sorts
of
regulation
of
the
land,
i
think
the
corps
does
have
authority
to
do
what
it
deems
necessary.
it
is
given
the
authority
in
the
flood
control
act
to
operate
recreational--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
the
state
may
have
also
have
regulatory
authority
over
the
land.
at
least
the
state
may
also
have
the
authority
to
regulate
the
hunting
and
fishing
on
the
land.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
guess...
let
me
try
to
clarify
it
for
you.
i
think
with
respect
to
this
land,
essentially
the
corps
doesn't...
has...
never
has
tried
to
impose
hunting
or
fishing
licenses
on
the
land,
and
under
corps
regulations,
state
and
local
regulations,
which
would
include
both
state
and
tribal
regulations
in
this
case,
would
apply
to
this
land.
and
if
someone--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i
would
take
the
word
local
to
mean--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
wouldn't
attribute
significance
to
that.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
yes,
you
can.
and,
in
fact,
although
i
think
the
corps
over
the
years
has
wondered
about
this
in
part
because
it
was
unclear
for
some
time
whether
this
land
was
part
of
the
reservation
at
all,
and
at
the
time
that
it
was
though
that
it
might
not
be,
then
different
rules
apply,
of
course.
but
i
think
once
that
got
clarified
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
has
a
single
position
here
that
all...
that
it's
the
federal
government's
position.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
believe
that
respondents
make
that
argument
in
their
brief.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
believe
they
recognize
that.
but,
in
any
event,
i
think
that
the
important
is
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--unlike
in
montana,
this
land
is
ultimately
governed
by
the
federal
government,
and
the
federal
government
not
only
does
not
see
anything
inconsistent
in
permitting
tribal
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
on
this
land,
especially
in
light
of
the
checkerboard
nature
of
the
area
being
surrounded
by
lands
on
which
the
tribe
undoubtedly
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
the
intent
of
the
corps
was
to
have
other
laws
that
govern
fish
and
game
apply
so
that
the
corps
doesn't
have
to
adopt
a
specific
federal
code
to
govern
those
kinds
of
matters
on
corps
land.
the
corps--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that,
first
of
all,
that
without...
i
think
that
that
is
directed
toward
the
corps,
and
that
was
congress'
prescription
to
the
corps
that
it
should
not
make
charges
for
access
to
these
areas.
congress
specifically
indicated
that
it
wanted
to
continue
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing.
indeed,
regulation
of...
some
regulation
of
hunting
and
fishing
is
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
the
stock
of
fish
and
game
on
the
land.
really,
some
system
with
certain
seasons
and
certain
types
of
animals
and
fish
being
taken
at
certain
times
is
required
or
you
won't
have
any
fishing
or
any
hunting--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
generally
speaking,
if
the
corps,
for
instance,
felt
that
the
flood
control
or
irrigation
purposes
of
this
project
would
be
disserved
by
permitting
people
on
some
area
of
it
or
on
the
whole
thing,
then
they
could
prohibit
any
hunting
and
fishing
on
the
project.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
it's...
yes.
and
i
think
that
not
unlike
many
other
circumstances,
it
may
well
be,
although
the
issue
of
state
jurisdiction
isn't
really...
wasn't
really
decided
below,
but
it
may
well
be
that
both
the
state
and
the
tribe
can
impose
requirements
on
people
who
want
to
hunt
on
this
land.
they
have
a
history
before
this
dispute
arose.
the
district
court
found
that
they
had
a
history
of
cooperative
control.
and,
indeed,
given
the
fact
that
the
game
moved
back
and
forth
from
tribal
to
trust
to
state
lands
and
so
on,
that
kind
of
cooperation
is
going
to
be
necessary
in
these
circumstances
anyway.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
if
there
were
some...
if
that
caused
some
undue
problem,
the
corps
could
always
remedy
that
by
adopting
its
own
regulations
and
preempting
both
of
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
