justice

white
so,
does
this
case
involve
the...
any
of
the
fee
land
except
the
area
taken
by
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
thought
that
the
analysis
in
montana
would...
in
the
montana
case
would
control
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
below
thought
otherwise.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
did
montana
say
the
state
got
the
authority
to
regulate
on
fee
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
clear
and
conceded
by
everyone
that
this
property
that
the
united
states
took
is
open
to
the
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
even
though
it's
in
the...
inside
the
reservation,
do...
does
the
public
have
a
right
to
come
and
go
to
that
property
despite
what
the
tribe
wants
to
do?
could
the
tribe
exclude
the
public
from
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--entirely
from
this
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
stick
with
exclusion.
can
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--have
they
claimed
that
they
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
then
before
the
united
states
took
this
fee
land
for
this
project,
the...
did
the
indians
claim
authority
to
regulate
the
owners
of
that
particular
fee
land
that
the
government
took?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
treated
this...
the...
before...
in
the
time
before
the
project
was
taken,
did
the
indian
tribe
treat
the
fee
land
that
was
taken
differently
from
the
fee
land
in
other
parts
of
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
project
had
never
been
taken,
if
the
united
states
had
never
taken
the
land,
would
the
indians
today
claim
that
they
had
the
authority
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
on
the
fee
land
that
the
government
did
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
exclusive
rights
for
grazing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
united
states
could
always
license
somebody
else
to
graze
under
its
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
if
the
corps
of
engineers
wanted
to
permit
people
to
fish
without
a
tribal
license,
they
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
fishing?
justice
byron
r.
white
exclusive
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
might...
it's
feasible
that
the
tribe
and
the
state
may
be
able
to
charge
a
fee,
but
once
you
get
into
other
regulations,
it
would
really
be
a...
it
would
really
be...
the
indians
might
have
one
notion
of
take
limits
and
the
state
might
have
another.
you
can't
live
up
to
them
both.
