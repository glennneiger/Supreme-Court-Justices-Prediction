justice
antonin
scalia
general
barnett,
where
does
the
state
acquire
the
authority
to
issue
hunting
licenses
for
this
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
corps
of
engineer...
corps
of
engineers
say
anybody
can
hunt
and
fish
without
a
state
license
or
we'll
issue
a
corps
of
engineers
licence
instead?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
maybe
your
authority
came
from
the
corps'
regulations
which
say
that
all
other
federal,
state,
and
local
laws
and
regulations
remain
in
full
force
and
effect,
where
applicable,
to
these
water
resource
development
projects.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
about
that,
but
i
just
wonder
whether...
you
know,
why
it
is
that
the
state
gets
the
right
to
exclude
anybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--federal
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
more
than
just
that
general
proposition
which
makes
the
point?
don't
the
statutes
provide
that
the
water
areas
of
all
corps
of
engineer
products
shall
be
open
to
public
use
generally
for
boating,
swimming,
bathing,
fishing,
and
other
recreational
purposes
and
ready
access
to
and
exit
from
such
areas
along
the
shores
of
such
product
shall
be
maintained
for
general
public
use?
i
mean,
there's
a
specific
law
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
because
it
says
it
shall
be,
you
know,
for
boating,
swimming,
bathing,
fishing,
and
other
recreational
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
have
the
power
to
license...
let's
talk
about
fishing
first...
when
the
statute
specifically
says
that
they
shall
be
open
to
public
use
for
fishing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
the
basis
for
your
license
fee
is
you
can't
fish
unless
you
pay
me
the
license
fee.
you
mean,
you
have
a
right
to
charge
a
license
fee
even
though
you
don't
have
a
right
to
prevent
them
from
fishing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
not
call
it
regulate.
you
assert
the
right
to
prevent
people
from
fishing
in
the
area,
don't
you?
to
prevent
people
from
fishing,
you
assert
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
prevent
them
from
fishing
if
they
do
not
have
that
license.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
that
does
not
fly
directly
in
the
face
of
that
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that's
unusual
to
say,
you
know,
this
fee
that
we've
taken
is
so
total...
we've
taken
everything
away
from
you...
that
we
feel
we
have
to
give
you
back
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish,
but
we
don't
have
to
mention
anything
about
your
right
to
continue
to
govern
the
land
to
the
extent
of
excluding
other
people?
i
mean,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
was
necessary
to
mention
that
the
indians
continue
to
have
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
or
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
it,
surely
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
mention
and
they
have
the
right
to
prevent
others
from
hunting
and
fishing.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
it
would
include
tribal?
i
was
interested
in
that.
is
the
regulation
that
says
all
other
federal,
state,
and
local
laws
and
regulations
remain
in
full
force
and
effect
where
applicable...
does
that
include
tribal
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
take
it.
would
the
corps
of
engineers
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
notice
that
they're
not
on
your
brief.
the
department
of
interior
is,
but
not
the
corps
of
engineers.
is
that
significant
in
any
respect?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
assume
that
everything
you
argue
is
agreed
to
by
the
corps?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
an
easy
case
then.
if
the
regulation...
i
mean,
what
are
we
going
through
all
this
trouble
for?
it's
clear
that
the
corps
has
the
authority
to
issue
these
regulations
and
if
the
sentence
in
the
regulations,
all
other
federal,
state,
and
local
laws
and
regulations
remain
in
full
force
and
effect,
where
applicable,
to
those
water
resource
development
projects,
that's
an...
this
is
an
easy
case.
why
hasn't
that
argument
been
made?
as
far
as
i
know,
it
has
not
been
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
make
the
argument
that
this
regulation,
local
laws
under
this
regulation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
it
is
the
interpretation
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
local
laws
in
section
327.0
of
their
rules
and
regulations
governing
public
use
of
water
resource
development
includes
tribal
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
mr.
feldman,
that
sentence
goes
on
to
say
as...
shall
be
maintained
when
such
use
is
determined
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
not
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
all
under
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
secretary
of
the
army
may
deem
necessary,
which
is
why
i
think
that
provision
of
c.f.r.
is
so
crucial
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
really
have
to
allow
any
fishing
at
all
if
they
don't
think
it's
in
the
public
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
i
don't
find
section
327.0,
which
is
the
regulation
i
was
reading...
i
don't
find
that
cited
in
either
the
brief
for
the
government
or
the
brief
for
the
tribe
in
this
case.
at
least
if
their
index
is
correct,
it's...
it
hasn't
been
cited.
