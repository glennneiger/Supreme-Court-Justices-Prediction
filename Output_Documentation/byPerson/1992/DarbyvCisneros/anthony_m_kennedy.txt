justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
you
have
to,
under
your
view,
even
wait
for
30
days
before
you
can
go
to
court,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
secretary
is
going
to
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
had
been
a
petition,
in
your
view
what
would
then
be
the
posture
of
the
case,
so
far
as
judicial
review,
if
the
secretary...
if
the
department
had
petitioned
the
secretary
for
the
secretary
to
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
sanctions
have
remained
in
effect,
i
take
it,
if
the
agency
had
petitioned
to
the
secretary
for
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it,
the
agency
could
appeal
to
the
secretary
to
impose
a
more
severe
sentence
or
more
severe
sanction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
even
under
your
view,
the
regulated
party
could
not
avoid
the
possibility
of
the
department
appealing
to
the
secretary
by
rushing
into
court,
because
you
have
to
wait
for
that
15-day
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
entertain
this
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
still
not
clear
to
me
what
your
position
is
as
to
whether
it
not
it
would
have
been
error
for
this
court
to
proceed,
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
suppose...
suppose
the
district
court
had
proceeded
with
this
case;
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
some
other
error?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
we're
talking
about
an
equitable
doctrine,
and
i
want
to
know
if
the
district
court...
or
a
district
court
situated
in
a
case
like
this
would
have
the
discretion
to
proceed,
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
