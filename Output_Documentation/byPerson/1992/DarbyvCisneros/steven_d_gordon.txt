mr.
steven
d.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
enacting
the
administrative
procedure
act,
congress
provided
a
general
authorization
for
judicial
review
of
administrative
actions.
in
section
10(c)
of
the
act,
it
prescribed
when
and
under
what
circumstances
someone
who
is
aggrieved
by
an
agency
action
may
seek
recourse
in
federal
court.
congress
provided
that
a
litigant
need
not
exhaust
available
administrative
remedies
before
proceeding
to
federal
court,
unless
such
exhaustion
is
expressly
required
by
statute
or
by
agency
rule.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether,
notwithstanding
that
congress
has
spoken,
a
federal
court
can
impose
additional
exhaustion
requirements
and
deprive
a
litigant
of
judicial
review
under
the
apa
because
he
failed
to
pursue
an
administrative
appeal
that
was
not
required
by
statute
nor
by
the
agency's
own
regulations.
the
answer
to
this
question,
we
submit,
is
no.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
straightforward.
in
1989,
hud
initiated
administrative
sanctions
against
petitioners,
mr.
darby
and
his
affiliates.
mr.
darby
contested
those
sanctions
in
full
conformance
with
hud's
regulations.
he
litigated
the
matter
before
the
agency
for
some
10
months
through
a
process
which
included
discovery,
a
4-day
evidentiary
hearing,
and
the
submission
of
post-hearing
briefs.
ultimately,
a
hud
administrative
law
judge
issued
a
lengthy
written
decision
which
upheld
the
sanctions.
pursuant
to
hud's
regulations,
the
alj's
decision
became
the
final
agency
action
unless
the
secretary
chose
to
review
it.
in
this
case,
neither
party
sought
such
secretarial
review.
mr.
darby
then
filed
this
suit
in
federal
district
court.
he
challenged
the
sanctions
on
the
grounds
that
they
violated
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
due
process
clause.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
the
district
court
denied
this
motion
and
proceeded
to
grant
relief
to
mr.
darby,
holding
that
the
sanctions
were
not
rationally
supported
by
the
facts
and
that
they
had
been
imposed
for
forbidden
punitive
reasons.
the
government
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit,
challenging
only
the
district
court's
ruling
on
exhaustion.
the
government
contended
that
hud's
regulation
providing
for
secretarial
review
of
an
alj's
decision
required
mr.
darby
to
seek
secretarial
review
as
a
prerequisite
to
filing
suit
in
federal
court.
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
that
contention.
the
circuit
court
recognized
that
no
statute
and
no
regulation
required
mr.
darby
to
seek
secretarial
review.
nonetheless,
it
decided
that
as
a,
quote,
rule
of
judicial
administration,
mr.
darby
was
required
to
exhaust
this
administrative
remedy.
since
he
had
not
done
so,
the
court
ruled
that
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
his
suit
and
left
the
administrative
sanctions
in
effect.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
simultaneously,
sir?
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that...
that
under
the
line
of
decisions,
including
particularly
icc
v.
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
that
at
the
point
that
the
alj's
decision
became...
was
issued,
that
mr.
darby
had
an
option,
and
that
he
could
have
either
pursued
and
administrative
appeal
or
proceeded
to
federal
court.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
and
there
was
an
interesting
line
of
cases
during
the
1950's
where
the
federal
courts,
the
circuit
courts,
wrestled
with
whether,
if
you
pursued
an
administrative
appeal,
the
time
for
your
appeal
to
federal
court
would
meanwhile
expire.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a
case
called
consolidated
flowers,
as
i
recall,
held
that
you
could
lose
your
right
to
judicial
review
if
you
pursued
the
administrative
appeal.
the
d.c.
circuit
ruled
to
the
contrary
and
ultimately
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
course.
and
i
believe
this
court
has
recognized
ever
since
a
decision
in
the
early
sixties,
cab
v.
delta
airlines,
that
if
you
do
pursue
an
administrative
appeal,
that
the
agency
action
is,
pending
that
appeal,
not
final
and
therefore
not
appealable
to
federal
court.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
scalia,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
simply
a
practical
and
common-sense
application
or
construction
of
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
simultaneously,
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
the
court
is
not
writing
on
a
clean
slate
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fundamental
principle
is
that
it
is
for
congress
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
and
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly,
and
as
recently
as
last
term
in
mccarthy
v.
madigan,
that
when
congress
has
prescribed
that
jurisdiction,
that
federal
courts
are
not
to
decline
such
jurisdiction
on
exhaustion
principles
unless
it's
consistent
with
the
expressed
intent
of
congress.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
disagree,
your
honor.
the
congress,
if
one
examines
the
final
sentence
of
section
704
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
has
clearly
dealt
with
the
issue
of
exhaustion,
and
not
simply
finality
as
the
government
contends.
the
final
sentence--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--no,
justice
o'connor,
they
are
not.
they
are
closely
related.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
first
sentence
of
section
704
clearly
imposes
the
finality
requirement.
the
second
section...
sentence
of
the
section
provides
that
intermediate
rulings,
or
procedural
or
preliminary
rulings,
are
not
directly
appealable,
but
may
be
heard
when
the
final
agency
action
is
appealed.
the
third
sentence,
which
is
what's
at
issue
here,
presupposes
final
agency
action
and
goes
on
to
address
whether
there
are
additional
procedural
requirements
that
a
litigant
must
follow.
we
would
submit
that
there
are...
that
it
is
clear
that
this
provision
deals
with
exhaustion
and
not
simply
the
finality.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
believe
that
there
are...
beyond
the
construction
of
the
provision
itself,
that
the
sentence,
justice
o'connor,
we
submit,
would
be
superfluous
and
inexplicable
if
it
deals
simply
with
finality.
the
finality
requirement
is
already
clearly
set
out
in
the
first
sentence.
moreover,
in
the
legislative
history,
and
in
particular
in
a...
a
explanation
of
the
apa
that
the
justice
department
did,
and
which
was
provided
to
congress
at
the
time
it
was
considering
the
apa,
the
justice
department
said
explicitly
that
the
last
sentence
of
section
10(c)
dealt
with
the
issue
of
exhaustion.
and
that
legislative
history
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
when
it
speaks...
it
uses
the
word
finality
twice.
it
says
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
agency
action
that
is
otherwise
final
is
final
for
purposes
of
this
section.
and
that
phrase,
"final
for
purposes
of
this
section.
"
that
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
it
is
reviewable,
because
in
the
first
sentence
the
congress
said
it's
reviewable.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
among
other
things,
5
years
ago
in
bowen
v.
massachusetts,
the
court
stated
that
the
primary
thrust
of
section
704
was
to
codify
the
exhaustion
requirement.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
agree
that
it
was
dictum,
sir,
but
not...
i
believe
it
was
the
correct
interpretation.
it's
consistent
with
the
legislative
history.
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
interpretation
that
scholars
have
placed
on
this
uniformly,
including,
most
particularly,
professor
davis
in
his
text,
and
also
other
commentators
in
various
law
reviews
that
we've
cited
in
our
briefs
to
the
court.
the
view
that
has
been
expressed
uniformly
is
that
that
sentence
deals
with
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
it
is
true,
and
professor
davis
and
this
court
in
bowen
have
noted,
that
the
courts
have
tended
to
ignore
that
sentence
in
many
decisions,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
that
is
what's
being
addressed
there.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
white,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
specific
time
limit
under
the
apa
for
filing
suit
once
you
do
have
final
agency
action.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
difficulty
we
have
with
the
government's
position
is
that
it
turns
section
10(c)
into
a
trap
for
the
unwary
litigant.
the
exhaustion
requirements
must
be
consistent
with
the
will
of
congress.
congress,
in
the
last
sentence,
has
said
that
you...
has
said,
in
section
704,
you
must
have
final
agency
action
in
order
to
seek
judicial
review.
it
says
that
if
you've
got...
whether
or
not
you
have
that
action,
it
deals
specifically
with
an
administrative
appeal.
and
it
says
that
you
don't
need
to
pursue
that
appeal
in
order
to
have
finality,
which
it
defines
as
the
prerequisite
for
judicial
review,
unless
you
are
expressly
required
to
do
so
by
statute
or
by
agency
rule.
it
insists,
therefore,
on
clear
procedural
ground
rules
that
are
spelled
out
in
advance.
and
what
the
government
has
done
here
is
come
in
and
sought
to
obtain
through
litigation
what
it
never
got
through
rule
making.
there
is
no
statute,
that's
agreed.
there
is
no
regulation,
it's
agreed,
that
requires
a
litigant
to
pursue
this
appeal
to
the
secretary.
and
yet
the
fourth
circuit
said,
propounding
a
rule
that
was
completely
inconsistent
with...
with
existing
law,
that
there
is
this
hidden
requirement
that
it
has
been
a
rule
of
judicial
administration
that
you
must
exhaust
all
available
administrative
routes.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
your
honor,
i...
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition
dealt
with
whether
or
not
congress
has
disposed
of
the
issue
in
section
10(c).
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
return
the
case
to
the
fourth
circuit,
although
we'd
certainly
be
prepared,
if
that
was
the
court's
view
of
the
appropriate
procedural
device,
to
do
it.
even
if
section
704
dealt
only
with
finality,
which
we
do
not
agree
with,
it
is
at
a
minimum
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
and
purpose
in
the
area.
and
to
impose
an
exhaustion
requirement
that
is
180
degrees
in
conflict
with
what
congress
has
indicated
there,
we
believe
would
be
completely
inconsistent
and
at
odds
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
saying
that
courts
must
defer
to...
be
careful
to
search
for
congressional
intent
in
the
area
and
to
follow
it,
and
not
to
impose
an
exhaustion
requirement
unless
it
is
clearly
consistent
with
what
congress
wanted.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
under
some
statutes.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
white,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
provision
under
the
apa
that
would
permit
an
appeal
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
that
any
appeals
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
under
other
statutory
schemes,
and
therefore
outside
the
context
of
the
apa,
and
i
do
not
know
whether
there
are
normally
time
limits
that
are
imposed
in
those
statutes.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
if
those
are
separate
statutory
schemes,
they
wouldn't
be
controlled
by
the
apa.
we
are
not
contending
that
section
704
governs
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
in
review
contexts
that
are
outside
the
apa.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
actually,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
it
would
be
15
days.
under
the
hud's
regulations,
the
parties
have
15
days
to
petition
for
secretarial
review.
in
this
case,
neither
side
petitioned
within
the
15-day
period,
and
therefore
at
that
point
we
believe
that
it
became
final.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
that's
a
very
interesting
question,
if
i
may.
if
we
had
had
the
normal
situation
where
the...
or
i
shouldn't...
a
situation
where
the
sanctions
were
not
in
effect
until
there
was
a
final
decision
and
the
sanctions
were
going
to
be
stayed
pending
secretarial
review,
clearly
we
would
not
have
a
final
agency
decision
that
could
be
appealed
to
federal
court
pending
the
secretarial
review.
the
interesting
twist
that
you
have
in
the
administrative
sanction
context,
the
suspension
debarment
context
here,
is
that
the
sanctions
are
effective,
are
in
effect
during
the
period
that
you're
litigating
before
the
agency.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
that
is
a
crucial
distinction
between
this
circumstance,
for
example,
and
the
one
presented
in
ftc
v.
standard
oil,
where
this
court
has
held
that
simply
filing
an
administrative
complaint
is
not,
in
and
of
itself,
appealable
final
agency
action.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
the
ldp
would
have.
you
get
into
some
technicalities.
the
debarment
did
not...
would
not
have
been
effective
until
the
secretarial
was
completed.
but
there
was...
there
were
simultaneous
sanctions
here,
and
there
was
a
limited
denial
of
participation
that
had
been
in
effect
from
day
1
and
remained
in
effect
throughout
the
administration...
the
litigation
before
the
agency.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
the
agency
had
sought
an
indefinite
term
of
debarment.
the
alj
had
granted
them
only
18
months,
so
they
had
not
gotten
the
period
that
they'd
asked
for,
and
therefore
they
would
have
had
a
basis
for
asking
for
a
heightened
sanction.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
have
noted,
also,
that
the
government
has
suggested
that
to
follow
our
position
and
construction
of
10(c)
would
invite
sort
of
piecemeal,
haphazard
judicial
review.
and
we
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case
at
all,
and
we
have
cited
a
variety
of
other
doctrines
that
we
believe
give
the
courts
full
power
to
keep
appropriate
control
over
litigants
who
would
rush
into
court
prematurely.
and
those
include
the
doctrine
of
ripeness,
the
doctrine
of
finality,
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have...
when
you're
seeking
review
under
the
apa,
that
your
record
is
limited
to
the
record
you've
created
before
the
administrative
agency
itself.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
to
some
extent
it's
a
truism
that
you
may
get
a
more
fleshed
out
decision
if
you
proceed
further
within
the
agency.
that's
always
at
least
a
possibility.
under
hud's
regulations,
secretarial
review
is
limited
to
the
record
that's
been
created
before
the
alj.
and
so
in
this
case,
all
you
could
have
gotten
would
have
been
some
further
elaboration
of...
of
the
rationale
for
proceeding
from
those
facts
that
had
already
been
found
by
the
alj.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
scalia,
it
would
not.
first
of
all,
in
a
decision
announced
2
weeks
ago,
that
you
wrote,
in
reiter
v.
cooper,
you
noted
that
exhaustion...
that
to
completely
bypass
an
administrative
remedy
would
violate
the
exhaustion
requirement.
10(c)
of
the
apa
deals
with
pursuit
of
administrative
appeals.
we
do
not
contend
that
10(c)
deals
with
a
complete...
it
talks
about
an
appeal
to
superior
agency
authority.
we
do
not
contend
that
it
covers
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
complete
failure
to
contest
before
the
agency,
a
complete
bypass
of
the
agency.
and
the
district...
the
d.c.
circuit
dealt
with
that
sort
of
a
case,
we
believe,
in
the
peter
kiewit
sons'
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
but
beyond...
beyond
that
distinction
within
the
exhaustion
doctrine
itself,
between
a
basic
failure
to
go
into
the
agency
at
all
versus
pursuing
an
administrative
appeal,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
if
you
didn't...
if
you
simply
left
the
debarment
in
effect
in
your
scenario,
you
would
have
no
administrative
record,
other
than
what
the
agency
has
created,
to
go
forward
on
in
appeal.
under
the
l.a.
truck
lines
case,
what
arguments
have
you
advanced
before
the
agency.
the
court
is
going
to
hold
you
to
those
that
you
advanced
before
the
agency.
and
there
are
doctrine...
you
know,
the
ripeness
doctrine
might...
might
be
invoked
there
as
well
by
a
court,
and
we
do
not
contend,
and
we
have
made
this
very
clear,
that
we
think
that
section
10(c)
controls
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
it
does
not.
it
simply
deals
with
the
issue
of
procedural
defaults.
that's,
in
our
view,
what
exhaustion
is
all
about,
procedural
defaults
as
opposed
to
whether
or
not
a
case
is
ripe
for
review
by
a
court
and
a
court
is
in
the
appropriate
position
to
rule.
i
would
note
that
senator
mccarren,
who
was
the
principle
sponsor
of
the
apa
in
the
senate,
described
it
as
a
charter
of
private
liberty
and
a
solemn
undertaking
of
official
fairness,
at
the
time
it
was
enacted.
he
said
that
it
was
intended
to
provide,
quote,
a
guide
to
him
who
seeks
fair
play
and
equal
rights
under
law.
in
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
hud
sanctions
were
arbitrary
and
unlawful.
mr.
darby
followed
the
guide
that
the
apa
set
out.
he
did
everything
that
hud
required
him
by
regulation
to
do,
and
he
did
everything
that
the
apa
instructed
him
to
do.
yet,
when
he
sought
redress
in
federal
court,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
he
had
not
done
enough
and
that
he
had
forfeited
any
opportunity
to
seek
to
right
the
wrong
that
hud
did
to
him.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision,
we
submit,
nullifies
the
promise
of
fair
play
that
congress
made
in
the
apa,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
that
promise
that
congress
made
50
years
ago.
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i'd
like
to
address
several
points,
if
i
may.
the
first
is
what
i
believe
to
be
the
absolutely
erroneous
contention
that
the
government
has
advanced
that
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
here
was
consistent
with
the
existing
law
of
exhaustion.
the
law
of
exhaustion,
from
the
time
of
meyers
v.
bethlehem
steel
up
through
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
mccarthy
v.
madigan,
has
always
been
that
litigants
are
required
to
exhaust
the
prescribed
administrative
remedy,
and
that
phrase
"prescribed"
is
critical
and
it
has
always
been
there.
and
in
our
view,
all
that
section
10(c)
of
the
apa
did
was
to
ordain
which
remedies
would
be
considered
prescribed
for
purposes
of
judicial
review.
moreover,
the
law
had
always
been
that
litigants
need
not
exhaust
permissive
administrative
appeals.
in
levers
v.
anderson,
decided
by
this
court
a
year
before
the
apa
was
passed,
justice
black,
writing
for
the
court...
precisely
this
contention
was
made.
the
government
stood
up
and
said
that
the
litigant
was
out
of
luck
because
they
hadn't
pursued
a
permissive
motion
for
reconsideration.
and
justice
black
said
that
the
court
was
not
persuaded
that
"may"
means
"must",--
and
yet
that's
what
we
hear
from
the
government,
"may"
means
"must".
and
if
you,
as
the
litigant,
if
you're
sufficiently
seasoned,
if
you
can't
figure
that
out,
shame
on
you.
that
is
nothing
less
than
turning
these
administrative
appeals
into
traps
for
the
unwary,
which
was
completely
at
odds
with
what
congress
set
out
to
do.
the...
i
would
note--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
do
not,
sir.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
would
also...
on
the
facts
here,
the
government
has
pooh-poohed
the
notion
that
the
ldp,
which
was
in
effect
throughout,
had
much
of
an
impact
on
mr.
darby.
the
record
reflects,
and
this
is
in
an
affidavit
filed
before
the
district
court,
that
during
the
10
months
that
he'd
already
been
under
the
sanctions,
he
had
lost
a
hud
contract
that
he
anticipated
would
have
been
worth
approximately
a
half
a
million
dollars
of
profit
to
his
business.
so
this
is
a
litigant
who
diligently
did
everything
that
hud
told
him
to
do
pursuant
to
its
regulations
at
the
same
time
he
was
enduring
a
tremendous
cost
for
doing
so.
and
the
government
suggests
that
there
was
little
cost
in
him
being
required
to
jump
through
further
hoops.
if
the
additional
75
days
for
the
secretarial
appeal...
and
that's
under
an
optimistic
time
frame...
had
gone
by,
the
ldp
could
have
expired,
because
it's
limited
to
a
year,
and
according
to
the
government
in
its
pleadings
before
this
court,
once
it
expires
it
becomes
a
moot
issue
because
it
doesn't
have
the
continuing
consequences
that
a
debarment
does.
so
the
government
propounds,
in
our
view,
nothing
less
than
a
catch
22
here,
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
a
catch
22
or
should
be
construed
by
this
court
to
place
litigants
in
that
position.
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court,
that
concludes
my
presentation.
thank
you.
