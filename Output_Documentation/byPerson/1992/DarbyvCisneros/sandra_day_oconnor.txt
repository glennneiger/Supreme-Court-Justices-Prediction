well
exhaustion
and
finality
aren't
the
same
thing,
are
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
don't
see
how
704
deals
with
exhaustion
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
isn't
clear
to
me,
because
all
it
talks
about
is
finality.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
704
simply
doesn't
address
exhaustion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gordon,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
we
think
that
704
deals
with
finality,
not
exhaustion,
and
that
courts
do
retain
the
equitable
discretion
to
decide
to
require
exhaustion
in
a
given
case;
would
your
argument
then
go
to
whether
the
court
properly
exercised
that
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
so,
is
that
question
here
or
would
the
court
have
to
send
it
back
for
that
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
feldman,
if...
if
you
are
correct
that
exhaustion
is
something
that
the
court,
in
its
discretion,
can
impose,
do
you
think
that
the
court
can
properly
impose
it
in
circumstances
where
it
does
become
a
trap
for
the
unwary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
like
in
this
case.
i
mean
it
certainly
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
litigant
here,
apparently,
that
exhaustion
would
be
required.
i
think
it
would
come
as
a
surprise
to
me,
reading
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
feldman,
on
that
point,
what
is
traditional?
are
there
cases
out
there
that
were
decided
before
the
adoption
of
the
apa
that
clearly
said
exhaustion
is
required
in
the
situation
of
a
discretionary
agency
appeal?
i
haven't
spotted
any
and
i
wondered
if
you
had.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they're
a
little
hard
to
pinpoint
under
traditional,
it
seems
to
me.
