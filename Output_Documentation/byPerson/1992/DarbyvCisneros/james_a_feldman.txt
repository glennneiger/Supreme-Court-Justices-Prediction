mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
petitioner
makes...
petitioner's
argument
makes
a
wrong
turn
because
it
relies
on
the
wrong
provision
of
the
apa.
section
10(c),
by
its
terms
and
by
its
intent,
deals
with
the
doctrine
of
finality.
section
10(a)
of
the
apa,
5
u.s.c.
702,
which
is
the
basic
provision
providing
a
private
right
of
action
for
those
aggrieved
by
agency
action,
that
provision
provides
the
sufficient
conditions
for
obtaining
judicial...
for
judicial
review.
there...
in
1976,
congress
determined--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
my
view
that...
it's
our
view
that
section
10(a)
is
the...
is
the
basic
provision
that
gives
you
a
right
of
action
for
judicial
review.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
and
then--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
i
would--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--702.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
on
1a
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
prior...
if
you
talk
about
prior
to
1976,
i
think
the
first
sentence...
well,
i
think
the
statute
didn't
specifically,
in
terms,
address
the
exhaustion
doctrine
prior
to
1976.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
it
didn't
address
it
by
its
terms.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
i
think
the
understanding
was,
not
only
with
respect
to
exhaustion
but,
as
counsel
conceded,
with
respect
to
ripeness
and
primary
jurisdiction,
other
doctrines
which
have
traditionally
been
equitable
doctrines
that
govern
the
timing
and
availability
of
judicial
review,
i
think
everyone
believed
that
those
doctrines
were
available
and
limited
judicial
review
in
the
period--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--prior...
prior
to
1976.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
after
1976,
there
is...
the
word
exhaustion
isn't
mentioned,
but
i
do
think
that
when
they
added
the
proviso
saying
nothing
herein
affects
other
limitations
on
judicial
review
or
the
power
of
a
court
to
dismiss
or
deny
relief
on
any
other
appropriate
legal
or
equitable
ground...
when
they
added...
when
congress
added
that
proviso,
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
like
the
other
doctrines
i've
mentioned,
are
plainly
encompassed
within
the
terms
limitation
on
judicial
review
or
appropriate
equitable
grounds.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think...
the
bowen
opinion
was
addressed
to
a
different
question,
a
different
part.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
actually,
i
think
the...
insofar
as...
insofar
as
it's...
i
think
it
was
not
a
full
statement--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
was
in
702
at
that
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but...
and
i
don't...
insofar...
it
was
an
issue
that
was
important
in
bowen,
but
i
would
say
there
was
a
footnote
in
bowen
which
i
think
states
our
position
precisely.
on
page
902
in
footnote
35,
the
court
said,
"it
is
certainly
arguable
that
by
enacting
section
704.
"
that's
10(c),
"congress
merely
meant
to
ensure
that
judicial
review
would
be
limited
to
final
agency
actions
and
to
those
nonfinal--
"
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that...
that
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
would
be...
that
would
be
an
additional
premise.
but
our
position
is
that
the
exhaustion...
that
finality
and
exhaustion
are
distinct
doctrines.
the
court
has
referred
to
them
as
distinct
doctrines
on
a
number
of
occasions.
the
court
did
it
last--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
except...
well,
except
that
i
think
702
shows
that
the
congress
in
1976,
when
it
was
amending
the
statute,
plainly
thought
that
exhaustion,
as
well
as
these
other
doctrines,
still
applied.
there's
nothing
unusual--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
see--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well
for...
the
amendment...
the
legislative...
the
reports
and
so
on
which
explicated
that
phrase
specifically
mentioned
exhaustion,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
doctrines.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
but...
no,
but
it
talked
about
traditional,
equitable
limitations
and
traditional
defense.
under
10...
under
petitioner's
view
in
this
case,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how...
what
remains
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
after
10(c).
there's
now
a
codified
rule
that
no
longer
governs.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
and
that,
i
think,
is
a
codification
of
the
traditional
rule
of
finality.
finality
has
to
do
with
when
an
agency
is
satisfied
that
its
decision
can
then...
can
take
effect
at
a
certain
point.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
whether
there's
an
additional
administrative
remedy
that's
available...
that...
available
to
a
litigant
to
cure
a
defect
in
an
agency
action.
that's
traditionally
the
distinction
between
the
two
doctrines,
and
there's
no
reason
in
the
language
of
section
704
to
think
that
it
was
dealing
with
the
latter
situation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
that...
first
of
all,
i
would
say
i
don't
think
that
question
has...
is
presented
by
this...
by
this
case.
but
i
think
it
is
an
equitable
doctrine,
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
there
may
be
cases
in
which
there
was
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
where--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think,
actually,
i
would,
with
respect,
differ
with...
on
that.
i
think
that
a
seasoned
litigant
before
an
administrative
agency
shouldn't
be
surprised
to
know
that
he
has
to
follow
an
internal
appeals
process
that
can...
especially
up
through
an
agency's
ranks,
before
he
can
go
to
court.
i
think
that
has
been
an
accepted
rule,
that
people
would
be
surprised
to
find
they
didn't
have
to
follow.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
if...
if
a
district
court
found...
let
me
add
one
other
fact,
and
then
i
can
answer
that,
which
is
petitioner
has
never
claimed,
that
i'm
aware
of
in
this
litigation,
that
he
wasn't
aware
of
the
internal
appeals
process.
but
if
you
take
a
case,
for
instance,
where...
where
a...
where
a
litigant
honestly
wasn't
aware
of
the
existence
of
an
administrative
appeal
process,
i
think
that
would
be
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
equitable
weighing
that...
that
happens
when
you
apply
the
doctrine.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would
say
that,
in
general,
the
doctrine...
the
doctrine
is
not
complex.
it
says
if
there's
an
adequate
remedy
that's
not
futile,
the
way...
the
decision
maker
is
not
biased.
if
it
meets
some
of
those
basic
prerequisites,
that
you
are
required
to
undergo
that
before
you
go
into
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
but
i
would
say,
for
instance,
in
the
question
of
what
is
an
adequate
remedy,
the
courts
have
discussed
a
number
of
different
types
of
factors.
there
might
be
a
case
where
a...
where
the
failure
to
publicize
a
process
or
impossibility
for
a
litigant
to
find
out
it
was...
it
was
even
in
existence.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
that
is
the...
that
is
the
consequence
of
having
an
equitable
doctrine
such
as
exhaustion
that
has
been
applied
for
100
years
to
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
we
would
disagree
that
it
was...
that
it
is
in
704.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think
section
704
serves
a
different
purpose,
or
this
last
sentence
of
section
704.
what
that
does
is
it
permits
a
litigant...
it
permits
an
agency
to
create
a
role
saying
you
have
to
take
this
internal
agency
appeal.
and
regardless...
and
then
at
that
point.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
is
a
pre--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--actually,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
704,
first
it...
704,
my
reading
of
it,
it
is
a...
it
provides
necessary
conditions
for
taking
advantage
of
the
procedure
for
judicial
review
that
was
created
in
702.
and
those
are
condition...
and
among
things...
i
think
it
would
be
common
ground
in
this
case
that
among
the
effects
that
704
has
is
if
the
agency
were
to
adopt
a
rule
saying
you
have
to
take
an
internal
agency
appeal
before
you
can
get
into
court,
if
an
agency
were
to
adopt
that
rule--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--a
litigant
would
have
to
do
that
regardless
of
any
application
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i'm
not
saying...
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
they
do
it
by
rule.
what
704
does,
and
i
think
this
is
probably
consistent--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
well,
if
i
said
that,
it
was
perhaps
a
little
misleading.
what
i
meant
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
legal
consequence
of
that
rule
is
that
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--not...
i
guess,
sir.
perhaps
maybe...
perhaps
not
exactly.
the
difference
is
the
legal
consequence
of
that
rule,
the
rule
that's
currently
in
the
regs,
is
if
he
wants
to
get
into
court,
he
should
exhaust
his
administrative
processes
unless
the...
there...
the
administrative
remedy
is
inadequate
or
futile
or
comes
within
one
of
the
other
exceptions
to
it.
if
the
agency
had
adopted
the...
an...
a
rule
that
said,
in
terms,
you
must
take
the
internal
agency
appeal
before
you
get
into
court,
then
the
existence
of
those
exceptions
would
be
irrelevant.
the
agency
would
therefore
have
the
power
to
say
you
have
to
do
it,
and
assuming
its
rule
was
valid,
you
would
have
to
do
it.
and
that's
what
the
power
to
have--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
was
a
reasonable
thing
for
congress
to
do,
to
give
agencies
the
power
to
do
that,
but
without
upsetting
the
exhaust
on
doctrine,
which
requires...
which
gives
agencies
a
chance,
under
the
common
law
that
had
developed
prior
to
the
apa
and
which
was
preserved
in
section
702,
to
make...
to
hear
litigant's
complaints
and
make
rulings
as
to...
and
make
sure
that
their
decisions
are
in
accordance
with
agency
policy
before
they
go
into
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
quite
common.
i
can't
give
you
a
percentage.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
one
reason
that
they
use
the
word
alj,
after
you
look
at
all
things
considered,
you
may
take
an
appeal
to
the
agency,
superior
agency,
to
the
secretary.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
that's
the...
but
that
is
a
standard
application
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
which
always
has
had
the
effect
of
barring
people
from
going
to
court
if
there
is
an
alternative
administrative
remedy.
this
case,
in
fact,
is
a
very--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--as
i
said,
an
agency...
an
agency
can
adopt
a
rule,
and
that
has
a
rather
different
effect
than
the
rule
that
they
did
adopt.
the
effect
of
a
rule
like
that
under
702,
under
the
authority
of
702,
is
to
make
it
an
absolute
requirement
that
you
go
to
superior
agency
authority,
regardless
of
whatever
the
equitable
factors
might
be,
or
the
exceptions
to
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion.
the
effect
of
just
simply
creating
a
remedy
for
a
litigant,
as
in
any
other
case
where
the
agency
creates
a
remedy
for
a
litigant
or,
as
here,
where...
this,
in
fact,
is
a
case,
similar
to
what
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier,
where
the
procedure
starts
by
the
agency
sending
out
a
notice
of
proposed
debarment.
if
the
litigant
doesn't
do
anything,
he
is
debarred,
i
think,
within
30
days,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
period.
now,
it
permits
the
agency...
the
litigant...
the
litigant
may
ask
for
conference
at
that
point.
i
think
the
rule
uses
the
word
"may"
in
that
context
as
well.
the
litigant
may
go
to
the
alj,
he
may
present
evidence
or
he
may
not.
that
doesn't
mean
that
if
he
sits
on
his
haunches
he
can
go
into...
he
can
go
into
court
prematurely.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there
are
such...
whether...
whether
he
would
be
a
superior
agency
authority
or
not
is...
maybe
it
isn't
worth
getting
into
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
but
in
any
event,
there
would...
could
easily
be
cases
where
that
would
be
the
case,
where
you
get
a
proposed...
i
know
the
department
of
energy
has
proposed
remedial
orders.
it's
a
very
common
way
of...
for
administrative
proceedings
to
run.
in
this
case,
it
happens
that
the...
the
notice
of
proposed
debarment
was
sent,
i
think,
by
an
assistant
secretary.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
that,
indeed,
was
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
what
had
happened
was--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
was
a
limited
denial
of
participation
which
was
issued
by
the
local...
a
local
hud
office
which
had
a
very
limited
effect.
it
applied
to
just
the
local
office
and
just
the
program
that
mr.
darby
was
involved
in.
that
took
effect
at...
before,
even,
the
notice
of
proposed
debarment
went
out,
and
that
was
simply
a
means
for
the
agency
to
protect
itself
while
anything
else
was
being
litigated.
to
say
if
we
suspect
someone
of
having
defrauded
us
or
swindled
us,
or
however
you
characterize
what
they
suspected
happened.
if
we
suspect
somebody
of
doing
that,
we
need
a
way
to
protect
ourselves
while...
we
can't
just
let
this
person
go
on
and
contract
in
the
same
program
with
us,
until
we
can
find
out
the
facts
and
figure
out
what
happened.
that...
the
rationale
for
that,
for
limited
denial
of
participation,
is
different,
very
different,
from
that
of
a
debarment.
and
we
could
discuss
whether
that's
a
good
idea
or
whether
an
agency
ought
to
be
able
to...
permitted
to
do
that,
but
if
that
limited
denial
of
participation
is
sufficient
to
permit
a
litigant
to
go
directly
into
court,
then
he
doesn't
have
to
wait
for
anything.
that
happened
actually
even
before
the
debarment
proceedings
had
started
here.
i
mean,
in
fact,
i
think
that
that's
a
reasonable
way...
that
serves
the
purpose
of
protecting
an
agency's
particular
program
while
a
debarment
is
being
considered.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
was...
it
was
available.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
was
available
at
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
it...
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
there's
about
three
or
four
different
strands
of
the
legislative
history.
one
is
the
consistent
statements
that
this
was
intended
to
codify
existing
law.
i
think
that
cuts
strongly
in
favor
of
our
position.
second,
there
was
attorney
general
clark's
statement--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i'm
talking
now
the
earlier
legislation.
in
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
as
it
applies...
as
it
applies
to
finality,
i
think
is
the
word
that
he
used,
i...
then
is
codified
in
this
section.
i
think
what
he
indicated
by
that,
plainly,
was
that
he
was
talking
about
finality
and
not
exhaustion.
he
wasn't
saying
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
apart
from
concerns
of
finality.
he
was
talking
about
finality.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
all
i
can
say
is
that
when
attorney
general
clark,
i
think,
used
the
words
"as
to
finality",
he
was
signaling
that
he
was
talking
about
finality
and
not
exhaustion.
and
this
court
has,
in
a
number
of
cases,
distinguished
between
the
two.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
other--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
those
things
could
be
relevant
to
either.
there
is
certainly
overlap
between...
even
between
ripeness
as
well.
the
petitioner
hasn't
alleged...
hasn't
said
that
section
10(c)
eliminates
the
ripeness
doctrine,
but
i
actually
don't
see
why
it
wouldn't
have
that
effect,
at
least
in
many
cases,
under
his
reading
of
the
statute.
but
the
other
comments
from
the
1945
or
1946,
they're
perfectly
consistent
with
our
reading.
what
they
say
is
it
permits
the
agency,
by
rule,
to
require
an
appeal
to
superior
agency
authority.
at
that
point,
that
is
codified,
it
is
a
prerequisite,
a
necessary
condition
for
obtaining
judicial
review
under
the
statute.
and
an
agency
can
do
that
regardless
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
provides
for
it.
and
regardless
of
whether
you
would
meet
any
of
the...
what...
the
traditional
exceptions
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
regardless
of
whether
somebody
would
view
it
as
inadequate
or
futile
or
whatever,
an
agency
can
require
you
to
go
through
these
processes,
assuming
its
regulations
are
valid.
in
1976--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
there
was...
the
attorney
general's
manual
actually
came
afterwards.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
there
was
one...
there
was,
i
believe,
one
copy--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
i
was
really
talking
about
the
attorney
general's
comments
to...
that
were
prior...
that
were
submitted
to
congress
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
there
was
one
comment,
i
think,
on
the
floor
or
in
a
committee
report,
that
was
similar
to
that.
the
attorney
general's
manual
just
said
more
or
less
the
same
thing.
but
except...
all
except...
all
of
those
comments,
except
for
attorney
general
clark's
first
statement,
are
perfectly
consistent
with
our
view,
which
is
it
permits
an
agency
to
require
someone
to
go...
appeal
to
superior
authority
without
any
of
the
limitations
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
that's
what
it
does
and
those
are
perfectly
consistent.
in
1976,
though,
i'd
add,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history...
first
of
all,
702
has
something
which
704
doesn't
have.
that
is,
704
has
no
general
term
which
could
encompass
the
specific
doctrine
of
exhaustion;
702
does.
it
talks
about
traditional
limitations
on
judicial
review
and
appropriate
equitable
grounds
on
which
a
court
may
deny
relief
or
dismiss
a
case.
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
those...
those,
even
just
on
the
language,
apart
from
the
legislative
history,
plainly
apply
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
it
certainly
is
a
tradition
limitation
on
judicial
review.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
well
it
says
apa
are
doing,
and
therefore
to
refer
also
to
7...
we
have
seen
so
far
is
7...
it
says--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
says
"affects
other
limitations".
mr.
james
a.
feldman
actually,
that
was
the
term
was
i
was
trying
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--other
limitations.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
it
probably
refers
to
section
702.
i
don't
think
it
really
makes
a
difference
because--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
and
one
of
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
what
congress
intended
by
the
702
does,
which
is
create
a
statutory
cause
of
action
for
judicial
review,
that
in
creating
that
we
are
not...
congress
did
not
intend
originally,
and
certainly
in
1976
made
clear
that
it
didn't
intend
to
upset
these
traditional
doctrines
such
as
exhaustion
and
primary
jurisdiction
and
lateness
and
so
on.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
haven't...
i
haven't
spotted
any.
actually,
i
haven't
spotted
cases
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
it
depends--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
believe
it.
i
think
that's
actually
a
codification
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
more,
if
you
look
at
cases
such
as
aircraft
&
diesel
against
hirsch,
that
was
a
case
where
someone
went
to
the
renegotiation
board,
had
a
ruling
against
them,
and
instead
of
pursuing
the...
what
is
very
comparable
to
what
happened
here,
which
is
an
appeal
to
the
tax
court
in
that
case,
but
to
a
superior
authority,
it
went
directly
into
court
to
complain
about
the
administrative
action.
this
court
held
that
that
was
barred
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
in
fact,
it
was
barred
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine
regardless
of
whether
he
could
ever
have
gotten
an
appeal
from
the
tax
court
judgment
in
that,
had
he
won
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
have
been
error
for
the
district
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--to
proceed
here.
my
position
is
the
district
court...
our
position
is
the
district
court
did
not...
the
district
court...
well,
i
think
there's
nothing
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
suggests
that
the
fourth
circuit
decided
it
wrong.
the
kinds
of
things
that
petitioner
raised--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
would
say
it
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
hard...
since
discretion
necessarily
allows
a
range
of
judgments,
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
that
there
would
be
no
circumstances,
especially
if
you
filled
in
some
additional
facts,
that
a
district
court
could
have
not
proceeded
on...
could
have
proceeded
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
facts
that
were
before
the
fourth
circuit
or
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
petitioner
were
sufficient
to
excuse
him
from
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
petitioner
about
whether
the
doctrine
applies
were
that...
that
the...
that
the
administrative
remedy
was
inadequate
because
the
secretary
could
extend
the
time
period,
even
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
that
the
secretary
ever
had
extended
the
time
period
and
even
where
the
periods
are
relatively
brief,
30
days
or
so.
i
think
he
could
have
had
a
complete
judgment
in
75
days.
the
fourth
circuit
rightfully
said
well
that's
not
a
basis
for
excusing
exhaustion,
where
you
have
no
basis
to
say
the
secretary
wouldn't
have
just
followed
the
time
deadlines
and
the
rules.
i
think
the
petitioner
also
claimed
that
it
would
be
futile
to
pursue
the
administrative
remedy,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
either
that
that
was...
that
that
would
have
been
a
factor
here.
that's
simply
his
speculation,
that
he
would
have
been
unsuccessful.
i
think
that,
in
fact,
this
case
is
a
classic
case
where
exhaustion
should
be
required.
the
court
has
said
exhaustion
is
particularly
potent
where
administrative
discretion
is
at
issue,
and
expertise.
well,
the
decision
whether
to
debar
is
expressly
made
a
discretionary
decision,
and...
and
it
involves
weighing
the
seriousness
of
the
acts
against
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
so
on.
those
are
decisions
that
the
secretary
should
have
had
a
chance
to
make,
if
petitioner
didn't
like
them,
before...
before
the
alj's
decision
was
reviewed
by
a
court.
in
addition,
of
course,
there's
a
lot
of
expertise
involved
here
in
interpreting
hud's
regulations
and
in
interpreting
the
debarment
procedure
itself
and
the
standards
for
debarment,
as
well
as
the
substantive
standards
governing
the
program
the
petitioner
participated
in.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
"may"
in
the
regulation,
it
doesn't
destroy
finality,
because
the
regulations
specifically
provide
that
the...
that
things
become
final
if
no
review
is...
if
no
one
seeks
a
further
agency
appeal.
what
the
"may"
does
is
it
gives
you
an
avenue
to
go
to
the
agency
so
it
can--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
guess
i
would
just
characterize
that
differently,
perhaps,
and
say
you
can't
go
to
court
because
you
haven't
exhausted
your
administrative
remedies,
even
if
it
becomes
final.
it's
the
same
thing
as
if,
where
a
district
court
judgment
becomes
final
before
an
appeal...
an
appeal,
a
timely
appeal
is
not
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
those
circumstances,
you
can't
then
take
an
out-of-time
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
judgment
is
now
final.
that...
this
"may"
has
the
same
effect
as
that.
the
agency
action
does
become
final
if
you
don't
do
anything.
that
is,
the
agency
is
satisfied--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
put
it
into
effect
if
the...
if
no
one
has
complained
to
the
secretary.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
that
is
generally...
that's
always
been
true
of
applications
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
and
actually
numerous
other
doctrines.
petitioners'
argument
basically
is
that
because
a
statute...
which
in
our
view
704
sets
a
necessary
condition
for
judicial
review.
because
you
meet
that
one
necessary
condition,
which
is
finality,
you
thereby
can
get
into
court,
that's
a
sufficient
condition.
and
i
think
all
of
the
court's
cases
dealing
with
the
whole
range
of
doctrines
that
we
discuss
in
our
briefs,
stand
for
the
proposition
that
even
where
you
meet
the
statutory
prerequisites
for
suit,
those
are
the
cases
precisely
where
these
doctrines
apply
and
can
govern
the
timing
and
availability
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would...
i
think
that
would
be...
in
appropriate
circumstances,
that
would
be
an
appropriate--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
if
there's
no
reason
to
do
it,
it
might
not,
although
i'm
aware
that
hud,
perhaps
in
an
appropriate
case,
could
provide
for
an
extension
of
the
time.
thank
you.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you
very
much.
