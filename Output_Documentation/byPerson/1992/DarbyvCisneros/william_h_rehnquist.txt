chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-2045,
r.
gordon
darby
v.
henry
cisneros.
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gordon,
the
opening
clause
of
the
last
sentence,
what
you're
talking
about,
says
except
as
otherwise
required
by
statute,
agency
action
otherwise
final
is
final
for
the
purposes
of
this
section.
that
is
surely
dealing
with
finality.
i
mean
it
says
so
in
so
many
words
and
it
says
nothing
about
exhaustion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
agree
with
you.
why
should
we
read
it
that
way?
it
certainly
doesn't
say
so
in
so
many
words.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
just
an
offhand
remark
in
that
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
government's
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
gordon,
that
you
may...
if
you
adopt
your
position,
a
litigant
can
obtain
judicial
review
before
getting
a
fully
fleshed
out
decision
from
the
agency.
that
you
might...
you
might
get
a
more
comprehensive
decision
from
the
agency
if
you...
if
you
exhausted
your
remedies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
the
more
you
make
it
equitable
and
discretionary,
mr.
feldman,
it
strikes
me
the
more
likely
it
may
be
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
i
mean
if
you
don't
know
until
you
get
to
court
how
a
judge
is
going
to
decide
as
to
whether
you
should
have
exhausted
that
last
remedy,
then
the
doctrine
really
does
have
some
potential
for
mischief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
not
talking
about
something
that
is
discretionary
in
the
sense
you
weigh
all...
or
the
district
court
weighs
all
the
facts
in
each
case.
you're
talking
about
a
general
rule
that
might
be
subject
to
some
exception.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
court
notes
from
your
admission
papers
that
today
is
your
birthday;
you're
43
years
old.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
happy
birthday.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gordon,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
the
case
is
submitted.
