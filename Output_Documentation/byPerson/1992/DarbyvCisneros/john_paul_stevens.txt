justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
10(a)
creates
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
codifies
the
exhaustion
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
before
the...
and
that's
what
requires
exhaustion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
language
in
10(a)
requires
exhaustion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
help
me
if
you
tell
me
what
language
in
that
section
talks
about
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
it
did
it
in
10(c).
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
question
is
is
there
any
language
in
10(a)
that
talks
about
exhaustion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
before
or
after.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
before
this...
before
'76,
where
did
you
find
the
exhaustion
doctrine
in
the
statute?
were
we
just
plain
wrong
in
the
bowen
opinion
saying
we
thought
it'd
been
codified
in
10(c)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
was
that
statement
just
plain
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
said
in
that
sentence
that
we
thought
10(c)
codified
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
you're
telling
me
that's
wrong;
the
exhaustion
doctrine
was
in
some
other
part
of
the
statute
or
somewhere
up
in
the
sky.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no
language
mentioned
it,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
notion
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
determined
when
an
action
was
final.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wouldn't
be
final
until
there
was
exhaustion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
entirely
consistent
with
the
text
on
the
next
page.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
entirely
nonstatutory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
language
would
still
have
exactly
the
same
meaning
if
the
exhaustion
doctrine
were
part
of
70(c)...
10(c).
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
amendment
in
'76
didn't
take
away
any
defenses
that
were
already
in
the
books,
including
the
requirement
of
finality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
didn't...
did
it
mention
exhaustion
as
something
separate
from
what
was
in
10(c)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
remains
that
if
the
agency
wants
him
to...
if
every
case,
if
they
want
the
applicant
to
make
the
petition
before
the
secretary,
they
ought
to
have
a
rule
that
says
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
feldman,
in
this
very
case
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
sentence
that
says
"any
party
may
request
such
review
in
writing
within
15
days.
"
really
means
every
party
must
request
review
if
that
party
wants
judicial
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
think
that's
misleading
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
it
hasn't
been
applied
this
way
since
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
enacted.
most
of
that
100
years
was
before
it
was
codified
in
704.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
they
have
adopted
that
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
say
that's
the
fair
reading
of
that
last
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
must
do
that
in
order
to
get
into
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
saying
that
the
secretary's
present
regulation
is,
in
your...
as
you
interpret
it,
exactly
that
kind
of
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
said
isn't
your
interpretation
of
this
sentence
that
he
must
apply
for
the...
within
the
15
days
if
he
wants
to
go
into
court,
and
you
said
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
exactly
what
i
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
you
say
is
it
means
is
you
must
file
within
15
days
unless
you
want
to
take...
assume
the
burden
of
proving
that
remedy
is
an
inadequate
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
it
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
talking
about
1945
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
they
also
plainly
apply
to
the
finality
requirement.
and
if
the
finality
requirement
includes
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
they
apply
to
both
at
the
same
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
"nothing
herein"
was
meant
to
be
this
additional
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
isn't
to...
it
isn't
to
waive
any
other
defenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
meyers
against
bethlehem
steel
is
the
classic
case
on
exhaustion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
that
a
finality
case?
the
holding
of
the
court
is
"no
one
is
entitled
to
judicial
relief
for
a
supposed
or
threatened
injury
until
the
prescribed
administrative
remedy
has
been
exhausted.
"
that's
what
the
case
held.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
was
codified
in
this...
you
don't
think
so.
