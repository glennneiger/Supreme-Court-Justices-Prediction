justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
the...
that
704
deals
with
finality.
but
it
does
deal
with
finality
and
it
says
that...
it
seems
to
say
that...
that
there
was
final
agency
action
here.
now,
is
there
a
time
limit
on
when
you
can
resort
to
the
courts
to
review
a
agency...
a
final
agency
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
might
be
final
for
purpose
of
going
to
court,
unless.
well,
it'd
still
be
final
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
court,
but
you
might...
may
be
barred
from
going
to
court
by
the
exhaustion
principle.
that's
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
is
it,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose...
i
suppose
you
get
relief
from
an
agency
action
sometimes
by
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals,
don't
you,
from
some
agency?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
agency
in
that
situation
had
exactly
this
kind
of
a
nonrequired
appeal
to
the
secretary,
and
yet
the
agency
order
would
be
final
just
like
it
is
here.
is
there
a
time
limit,
usually,
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
do
you
know,
in
those
cases,
when
an
agency
action
is
final?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
can
require
it.
in
which
event
the...
in
which
event
the
agency
action
isn't
final.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
agency
so
provides
by
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
feldman,
do
you
know
if
this
"may"
language
is
common
among
the
agencies
in
terms
of
internal
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
say...
i
wonder
why
they
use
the
word
"may".
it
seems
kind
of
silly
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
they
either
put
up
or
shut
up.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you...
yeah,
but
you've...
but...
but
the
agency,
in
using
"may",
bars
them
from
going
to
court
right
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
704
seems
to
say
that
if
you
want
to
postpone
finality,
the
agency
wants
to
postpone
finality
or
hold
up
going
to
court,
the
agency
should
do
it
by
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
it
by
rule
and
say
that...
that
the...
that
the
action...
what...
the
rule
that
says
that
the
action
is
meanwhile
inoperative,
so
it
isn't
final.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
say
that
he...
that
this
permissive
review
wasn't
available
to
this
person,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose
the
secretary
had
turned
him
down;
he
could
go
to
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
this
"may"
type
internal
review
suspends
finality.
i
mean
it
destroys
finality
for
purposes
of
judicial
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
what
if
you
don't...
you
cant'
go
to
court
because
it
isn't
final?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
though
final,
you
can't
get
into
court
without...
without
exhausting
your
remedies.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
had
thought
sometimes
that...
that
where
exhaustion
applies,
a
court
in
which
a
suit
is
filed
would
just
stay
its
hand
until
the
administrative
remedy
is
exhausted.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
time
limit.
