justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gordon,
what
if
your
client
had,
in
fact,
taken
an
appeal
within
the
agency?
your
position
then
is,
i
take
it,
that
still
and
all,
you
would
be
able
to
come
to
court
and
prosecute
an
appeal
both
in
court
and
before
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
that?
because...
i
mean
the
text
of
section
704
reads
"whether
or
not
there
has
been
filed.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
isn't
that
contrary
to
the
language
of
704?
it
says
whether
or
not
there
has
been
filed.
what
i'm
saying
is
maybe
we've
been
playing
with
704
up
to
now;
why
don't
we
continue
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
because
it
would...
it
would
seem
ridiculous
to
be
prosecuting
an
appeal
both
before
the
agency
and
here,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
couldn't
a
court
consider
it
ridiculous
for
you
to
come
complaining
to
the
courts
when
you
haven't
completed
complaining
to
the
agency?
why
isn't...
why
couldn't
i
consider
that
ridiculous
too
and
say
i
certainly
don't
want
to
interpret
704
to
provide
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
suggesting
we've
given
that
away.
the
language
of
704
does
not
permit
what
you've
just
said
we've
done.
the
language
of
704
says
that
it's
final,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
lodged
an
appeal
within
the
agency.
but
you
tell
me
that
if
there
has
been
lodged
an
appeal
within
the
agency,
we
will
not
consider
it
final,
despite
the
language
of
704,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
arguing,
well,
this
is
just
another
extension
of
the
same
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
gordon,
wouldn't
the
logic
of
your
position
even
apply
to
the
case
in
which
there
has
been
no
record
made
at
all?
would
it
not
apply
to
a
structure,
for
example,
in
which
debarment
can
be
announced
without
a
hearing
by
a...
by
an
agency
officer,
whereupon
the
contractor
has
the
right,
if
it
wishes,
to
request
an
alj
review
of
that
debarment?
all
right,
now
under...
with
an
appeal
later
to
the
secretary,
the
rest
of
it
just
like
the
current
system.
in
that
situation,
wouldn't
you
maintain
that
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
hearing
at
all?
you
could
get
debarred,
simply
not
go
to
the
alj,
and
come
right
into
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't...
wouldn't
that
be
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
10(a)?
could
you
give
me
a
code
number
for
10(a)?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
what...
what
is
the
purpose
of
704,
if
it
isn't...
if
it
isn't
that?
i
mean
i
agree
that
finality
and
exhaustion
are
different
concept,
but
so
are
animal
and
dog
different
concepts,
but
one
is
a
subspecies
of
the
other.
why
isn't
exhaustion
one
sort
of
lack
of
finality;
it's
not
final
because
you
haven't
exhausted
your
administrative
remedies?
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
way
to
explain
why
exhaustion
is
different
from
finality,
but
nonetheless
makes
sense
of
section
704?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not
what
the
apa
was
meant...
the
apa
was
sponsored
by
the
american
bar
association
to
stop
these
newfangled
agencies
from
jerking
people
around,
and
the
purpose
of
704
was...
was
explicitly
to
stop
agencies
from
making
you
go
through
one
hoop
after
another
hoop
after
another
hoop
before
you
could
get
to
court.
isn't
that
the
purpose
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
always
thought
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
of
course,
as
mr.
gordon
said,
the
alj
before
whom
he
would
have
the
hearing
cannot
really
be
described
as
a
superior
agency
authority
in
that
context.
so
i
don't
know
that
704
would...
would
comfortably
be
applied
to
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why...
why...
what
is
the
great
disaster
about
our
just
saying...
i,
frankly,
don't
see
what
704
was
directed
at
unless
it
was
the
problem
of
the
agencies
setting
up
one
obstacle
after
another
after
another
before
you
can
finally
get
to
the...
get
to
court.
and
what
704
says
is
you
can
do
it,
but
if
you
want
to
do
it
your
agency...
your
action
cannot
be
effective.
you
have
to
announce
in
advance,
and
the
real
bite
is
your
action
cannot
be
effective,
you
cannot
debar,
you
have
to
just
propose
to
debar.
and
then
you
can
make
me
jump
through
as
many
hoops
as
you
like,
but
nothing
happens
meanwhile.
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
no.
he
was...
the
final
debarment
had...
had
not
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there...
but
there
was
a
disqualification
from
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
discussion
of
legislative
history,
are
you
talking
about
the
attorney
general's
manual?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
702.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
particular.
it's
saying
in
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
we're
not
waiving
all
these
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we're
not
talking
about
702,
we're
talking
about
704.
the
issue
is
what
704
provides.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
cases,
mr.
gordon,
in
which
the
concept
of
finality
was
applied
to
failure
to
seek
an
appeal
within
the
agency?
say
it's
not
final
because
you've
failed
to
seek
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
don't
either.
