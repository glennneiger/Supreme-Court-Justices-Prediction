mr.
feldman,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
justice
scalia
kind
of
asked
you.
that
is
isn't
the
legislative
history
against
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
some
of
the
language
of
the
section
itself
is
just
as
consistent
with
exhaustion
as
it
is
with
finality,
in
a
very
narrow
sense.
i
mean
you
yourself
said
10(a)
can
be
dealing
with
exhaustion
though
it
doesn't
mention
it,
and
i
suppose
the
same
thing
is
true
of
10(c).
and
when...
when
you've
got
text
that
refers
to...
to
requests
for
reconsideration
and
appeals
to
superiors,
i
mean
that
smacks
just
as
much
of
exhaustion
as
it
does
of...
of
finality,
in
the
narrow
sense,
doesn't
it?
so
that
would
be
consistent
with
that
legislative
history
that
you
try
to
explain
away.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
but
the
text
still--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean
the
text,
in
references
to
reconsideration
and
superior
authority,
is
dealing...
despite
its
finality
language,
is
dealing
with
exhaustion
concepts,
is
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
provides
for
a
necessary
condition.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
does
not
impose
it.
