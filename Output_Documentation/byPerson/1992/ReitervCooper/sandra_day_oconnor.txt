well,
mr.
phillips,
i
guess
the
shipper
would
have
access
to
the
public
information
to
know
whether
the
rate
had
been
filed
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
whether
your
client
was
time-barred
from
seeking
reparations
at
the
time
that
the
respondents
here
first
tried
to
collect
the
alleged
undercharges?
is
there
a
time
barr
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
time
barr
affect
the
ability
under
your
position
to
go
back
to
the
icc
for
the
reasonableness
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
bankruptcy
court
collect
the
full
amount
of
the
filed
rate
and
just
hold
it
until
such
time
as
you
have
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
go
to
the
icc?
