we'll

91-1496,
peter
c.

v.
langdon
m.
cooper.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying,
mr.
dreeben,
that
then
your
view
of
the
situation
contemplates
at
least
the
possibility
that
the
role
would
be
different
in
bankruptcy
than
outside
of
bankruptcy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
have
a
negotiated
rate
i
suppose
the
shipper
complies
with
the
pay
provision
by
simply
paying
the
negotiated
price?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
they
both
think
they
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
would
have
been.
mr.
steinfeld,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
duty
to
pay
the...
you're
not
talking
about
a
violation
of
the
obligation
to
pay
when
shipped?
you're
talking
about
a
duty
to
pay
the
filed
rate,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
surely
the
duty
to
pay
when
shipped,
if
there
has
been
a
negotiated
rate
and
both
the
trucker
and
the
shipper
have
agreed
to
the
negotiated
rate,
that
can't,
that
is
never
going
to
be
enforced
beyond
the
negotiated
rate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
as
a
practical
matter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
practical
matter
when
the
trucker
agrees
to
ship
for
a
certain
amount
and
the
shipper
agrees
to
pay
a
certain
amount,
that's
what
the
parties
expect
and
so
that's
what
payment
will
be
made,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
a
total
abstraction
in
the
real
world.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
true
in
any
action
for
reparations
out
of
bankruptcy.
if
the
shipper
has
a
right
to
bring
an
action
for
reparations,
the
other
shippers
who
paid
the
full
filed
rate
would
be
short
changed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
said
the
icc
took
2.5
years
to
determine
what
policy
it,
how
it
would
treat
these.
it
didn't
say
it
would
take
2.5
years
to
decide
each
individual
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
understood
it
then
you
just
misstated
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
a
practical
matter
the
shipper
says
to
the
trucker
what
do
i
owe
you,
and
the
trucker
says
you
owe
me
the
negotiated
rate,
and
he
delivers
the
goods
for
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
that,
that's
what
in
effect
happens,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
not
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
with
the
question,
mr.
steinfeld.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
pay
when
received
as
if
it
was
perfectly
evident
to
the
shipper
that
he
owed
more
than
he
was
actually
being
charged.
but
if
that's
the
agreement
he
has
bargained
for
it
would
be
quite
natural
for
him
to
expect
to
receive
the
goods
when
he
paid
the
price
he
bargained
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
that
is
like
western
pacific
where
the
time
for
that
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
be
too
sure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
steinfeld.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
