mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
white,
i
believe
the
issue
here
is
squarely
raised
by
this
idea
of
the
petitioner
and
the
government
saying
that
if
the
carrier
had
billed
the
filed
rate
at
the
time
of
shipment
that
there
would
be
no
reparations,
rather
there
would
be
no
stay
in
referral
proceeding.
that's
directly
from
the
petitioners'
brief.
that
is
a
ridiculous
concept
because
it
ignores
the
principal
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
is
that
filed
rates
are
constructively
deemed
to
know,
that
shippers
are
constructively
deemed
to
know
at
the
time
of
shipment
what
the
rate
is.
all
rights
as
between
the
parties,
the
shipper
and
the
carrier,
are
defined
by
the
filed
rate.
it
is
ridiculous
to
assume
that
a
negotiated
rate
bargain
has
legal
significance.
this
court
affirmed
that
concept
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
assume
that
in
the
maislin
case.
so
here
we
have
the
unusual
position
advanced
by
both
the
government
and
the
petitioner
that
i
can
have
an
illegal
rate
bargain
and
that
shipper
will
be
free
from
the
duty
to
pay
that
filed
rate
and
can
raise
the
defense
of
reasonableness--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--yes.
the
duty
to
pay
when
shipped
and
the
duty
to
pay
the
filed
rate
are
the
same,
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
the
statute
in
its
section
1074--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--well,
as
a
practical
matter
the
shipper
has
constructive
knowledge
and
they
best
check--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--that
may
be
what
payment
will
be
made,
but
that
has
no
legal
significance
under
the
law
and
the
precedent
of
this
court's
opinions.
the
pay
first
before
tendering
delivery
of
freight
is
not
to
pay
what
was
negotiated.
it
is
to
pay
the
filed
rate.
you
cannot--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--your
honor,
whether
it's
an
abstraction
or
not,
it's
the
law.
and
it
was
defined
by
the
maislin
court.
any,
a
mis-billing
has
no
legal
significance,
and
the
pay,
the
prompt
pay
provision
of
10743
is
to
promptly
pay
filed
rate
charges.
it
would
turn
the
statute
on
its
head
if
the
prompt
pay
provision,
if
congress
said
you
must
promptly
pay
whatever
is
billed.
congress
does
not
say
that
the
billed
rate
has
any
significance,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
i
say
that's
without
any
statutory
support.
that--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--western
pacific
is
a
tucker
act
case.
i
think
western
pacific
supports
our
position
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
yes,
but
all
parties
conceded
that
the
united
states
had
a
unique
right
of
set-off.
in
other
words
the
united
states
under
the
tucker
act
need
not
pay
filed
rate
charges,
need
not
be
worried
about
paying
the
filed
rate
charges,
did
not
have
to
worry
about--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--western
pacific...
the
doctrine
of
primary--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--your
honor,
part
of
the
holding
was
indeed
applying
primary
jurisdiction.
that
dealt
with
the
issue
of
tariff
interpretation.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
it
was
reasonableness
as
applied
to
determine
which
of
two
applicable
filed
rate
applied,
justice
white.
but
it
was
very
significant
in
western
pacific
that
this
court
said
that--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--only
because,
only
because
it
didn't
have
to
under
the
tucker
act.
it
had
the
right
of
set-off.
there
is
no
case
in
this
court's
history
that
has
allowed
a
shipper
to
with
impunity
refuse
to
pay
a
filed
rate
by
raising
the
defense
of
reasonableness.
this
court's
precedent
going
back
to
robinson
and
arizona
grocery
said
that
shippers
were
bound
to
pay
filed
rate
charges.
they
might
recover
reparation,
but
they
were
bound
to
pay
filed
rate
charges.
and
the
problem
presented
by
this
case
is
that
the
act
itself
has
several
provisions.
the
plain
meaning
and
structure
of
the
act
says
that
you
must
charge
filed
rate
charges
at
all
times.
the
reason
is,
the
policy
is
to
insure
that
rates
be
non-discriminatory,
there
be
no
undue
preference,
no
discrimination
or
undue
discrimination,
and
that
rates
be
reasonable.
the
reasonableness
concept
is
not
equal
dignity
with
the
filed
rate.
it
flows
as
one
of
the
requirements
and
the
goals
of
the
act.
the
goal
of
anti-discrimination
is
different
from
the
goal
of
reasonableness.
they
are
the
same.
how
do
you
enforce
that
there
be
no
discrimination
between
carrier
and
shipper,
or
rather
between
shippers
for
the
carrier?
how
do
you
enforce
that
rates
be
reasonable?
the
only
way
you
can
enforce
that
rates
be
reasonable
is
that
the
public
has
knowledge
of
them.
and
how
is
that
to
be
accomplished?
in
1887
congress
developed
a
statutory
scheme
that
said
publicity
of
rates,
once
we
publish
our
rates
the
world
will
know.
and
at
that
point
the
question
presented
was
well,
what
do
you
do
about
determining
the
reasonableness?
in
the
past
the
courts
could
adjudicate
the
issue
of
reasonableness
because
there
was
no
icc.
once
the
icc
was
created
the
courts
were
to
stand
back
and
not
decide
the
issue
of
reasonableness,
but
the
courts
were
to
enforce
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
and
so
the
policy
of
rate
stabilization,
reasonableness,
and
uniformity,
you
had
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
you
had
the
publicity
of
rates.
then
a
statutory
scheme
was
developed.
how
do
you
challenge
reasonableness
in
post-shipment
litigation?
well,
first
let's
start
out
before
the
shipment
occurs.
the
rate
is
posted.
it's
not
effective.
the
icc
can
set
it
aside,
rather
can
stay
it,
can,
through
a
suspension
investigation
proceeding
for
up
to
7
months.
during
that
time
the
carrier
cannot
collect
that
rate.
once
the
rate
goes
into
effect,
however,
the
statute
says
it
must
be
collected.
this
court
in
arrow,
burlington
northern,
and
the
other
cases
that
follow,
said
that
would
be
a
ridiculous
concept
if
the
agency,
while
it
was
investigating
the
reasonableness
of
a
rate,
the
statute
said
7
months,
you
haven't
made
your
decision,
rate
goes
into
effect.
now
all
of
a
sudden
a
shipper
says
well,
you're
rates
are
under
investigation,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
that
whole
rate.
i'll
pay
the
part
that
i
think
is
reasonable.
that
would
turn
the
statute
on
its
head.
the
statute
says
after
7
months
the
rate
is
to
be
collected.
then
what
happens
to
the
rights
of
the
shipper?
what
happens
is
they
have
a
right
of
reparation
under
the
statute
11705(b)(3).
they
pay
the
rate,
then
they
can
seek
to
get
a
refund.
hence
the
language
in
arizona
grocery,
bound
to
pay,
might
recover
reparations.
petitioner
and
the
government
would
have
it
read
might
have
to
pay
if
the
rate
is
reasonable.
there's
just
no
support
for
that
in
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
reparations
are
always
available
within
the
statutory
scheme.
let's
go
back
to
the
doctrine
of
constructive
notice.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
that's
the
way...
the
statutory
scheme
is
you
do
bring
a
suit
for
reparations.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
know
that
it
can
never
be
collected
because
in
bankruptcies
there
are
payments.
there
could
even
be
full
payments.
amici
american
freight
has
paid
80
cents
on
the
dollar
already.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
absolutely,
because,
your
honor,
that's
the
only
way
to
prevent
discrimination.
think
of
two
shippers.
the
shipper,
for
example,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
you
had
the
shippers
that
all
paid
this
perhaps
high
rate,
unreasonable
rate,
but
they
paid
it
because
they
followed
the
law.
and
there's
this
one
shipper
that
colluded.
and
frankly
in
this
case
there's
good
evidence
that
it
happened
in
this
case,
in
this
exact
case,
that
there
was
collusion
between
the
carrier
and
the
petitioner.
in
this
case
the
shipper
agrees
to
a
negotiated
rate,
comes
to
find
out
later
on
a
trustee
is
appointed
and
says
oh,
you
shall
not
do
that,
you
must
collect
the
filed
rate.
i
want
to
judge
the
reasonableness
7,
8
years
later.
what
happens
to
all
of
the
other
shippers
that
followed
the
law?
where
are
their
rights
today?
their
rights
are
extinguished.
now
we're
going
to
reward
the
shipper
that
had
not
only
constructive
knowledge
but
i
would
submit
in
our
case--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--i
agree,
your
honor,
except
that
they...
no,
not
totally,
because
once
that
reparations
action
was
brought,
the
date
that
is
filed
any
other
shipper
that
desired
to
file
it
would
have
that
same
right
at
that
point
in
time.
here
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
they're
claiming
because
the
carrier
is
in
bankruptcy,
and
note
there
is
no
bankruptcy
exception
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
all
of
a
sudden
rights
are
changed.
the
petitioner
argued
and
the
government
said
well,
if
the
carrier
was
solvent
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
this.
your
honor,
who
knows
who
is
solvent
tomorrow.
let's
say
there
was
a
reparations
proceeding
and
instead
of
carolina
motor
express
it
was
consolidated
freightways,
great
company.
and
all
of
a
sudden
during
this
2.5-year
period
that
the
government
is
saying
the
icc
is
going
to
consider
a
reparations
claim
all--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice,
that,
i
understand
that,
but
let's--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
we
don't
know
that
the
day
after
a
solvent
carrier,
that
the
government
says
that
the
reparations
scheme
is
different
when
you're
involving
a
solvent
carrier,
we
don't
know
that
that
carrier
is
going
to
be
solvent
tomorrow
or
the
next
day.
and
we
don't
know
that
the
shipper
is
going
to
be
solvent
to
pay
the
filed
rate
charges
years
from
now.
the
act
does
not
assume
solvency.
the
act
gives
people
rights,
give
companies
legal
rights.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
is
exactly
true.
certainly
the
majority--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--in
fact
i
do
know
of
one.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
consolidated
freightways
did
bring
a
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
that
is
endemic
of
the
problem
because--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--i
would
say
in
this
case,
in
carolina
motor,
about
97
percent
of
all
shippers
paid
the
filed
rate
charges.
only
3
percent
rating
error
was
found
by
the
auditors.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
it
still
went
bankrupt.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
in
the
market
as
a
whole
today?
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
regrettably
it
was
prevalent,
but
not
overwhelming.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
the
majority
of
shippers
still
pay
filed
rate
charges
and
carriers--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--i
would
say
since
this
court's
opinion
in
maislin
there
has
been
a
reform,
and
certainly
people
have
come
back.
when
things
go
out
of
kilter
that
doesn't
mean
the
court
comes
back
and
corrects
them
outside
of
the
legislative
scheme.
you
can't
come
back
and
legislate
and
say
well,
the
problem
is
out
of
kilter.
that's
up
for
congress
to
do.
and
congress
has
considered
bills
and
they
may
yet
consider
bills
in
the
coming
session
to
deal
with
the
undercharge
problem.
but
the
statutory
scheme
hasn't
been
changed.
this
is
a
great
note,
that
since
1887,
1908
is
the
last
major
change
to
the
statutory
scheme
involving
reparations.
and
we're
trying
to,
the
petitioners
and
the
government
want
to
carve
out
an
exception
that
goes
against
case
upon
case
upon
case
in
this
court.
a
shipper
is
bound
to
pay,
mitchell
coal
&
coke,
international
coal
mining,
arizona
grocery.
how
did
we
all
know
that
those
railroad
companies
were
not,
were
going
to
be
around
the
next
time
when
the
reparations
award
was
to
be
made?
the
statute
gives
you
rights,
legal
rights
to
collect
money.
it
doesn't
insure
that
there
is
a
bank
account
there
waiting
for
you
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow.
in
this
situation
if
the
shippers
are
forced
to
pay
reparations
they
may
well
get
back
10
cents
on
the
dollar
or
100
cents
on
the
dollar,
but
they
will
get
what
other
people
would
get,
like
situated
companies.
you
have
the
tire
manufacturer
that
sold
tires
to
the
trucking
company.
he's
sitting
out
there.
he
may
have
a
claim.
he
deserves
to
get
paid
as
much
as
the
shipper
who
is
conclusively
presumed
to
know
the
rate
and
went
into
this
illegal
rate
bargain
and
now
wants
to
say
well,
i
didn't
really
know
the
rate.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
i
would
say
that's
probably
true.
and
regrettably
the
marketplace
was
not
properly
administered
by
the
icc.
the
icc,
as
this
court
found,
gave
lip
service
to
the
filed
rate
doctrine
during
the
1980's.
the
utterly
central
provision
of
the
act
was
ignored.
rate
bargains
were
encouraged.
the
negotiated
rate
policy
statement
was
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
carriers
and
shippers
were
told
don't
worry
about
the
law.
and
now
we
have
a
national
plague
of
bankruptcies.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
you're
saying
if
he
had
a--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--that
is
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
we
have
no
right
of
set-off
in
this
situation.
but
the
tire
manufacturer,
if
he
had
no
other
claim...
my
position
was
he
is
a
creditor
because
he
is
owed
money
pre-petition,
and
in
this
situation
the
claimant
would
have
a
post-petition
debt
for
this
reasonableness
charge.
but
again,
constructive
knowledge
is
a
doctrine
that
can't
be
ignored
by
this
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
not
all,
not
all
companies
that
have
charged
low
rates.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
mix--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--i
think
that's
what
the
government
is
urging
certainly.
i
think
that's
a
gross
simplification
of
what
has
happened
in
this
marketplace.
there
have
been
efficient
carriers
that
have
been
forced
to
compete
with
very
inefficient
carriers,
and
because
of
the
lack
of
following
the
filed
rate
doctrine
and
allowing
stability
of
rate
making
those
carriers
also
had
to
adjust
their
rates
down.
it
would
take
many
hours
to
determine
what
indeed
was
the
cause
of
all
these
bankruptcies
in
the
motor
carrier
industry.
but
certainly
the
lack
of...
the
marketplace
was
not
supposed
to
react
that
way.
in
1980
there
was
supposed
to
be
an
increase
in
competition.
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
specifically
written
with
a
policy
of
insuring
against
discrimination,
and
that
was
retained,
preventing
of
destruction,
destructive
competition.
none
of
that
occurred,
but
we
still
have
the
same
statutes.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
this
is
true.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
the
filed
rate
doctrine
itself
cures
many
ills,
allegedly.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
justice
stevens,
there
is
certainly
that
feeling.
but
that
again,
i
would
submit,
as
this
court
said
in
square
d,
it
was
a
great
feeling
in
square
d
that
the
doctrine,
the
keogh
doctrine
should
be
abandoned,
but
again
it's
up
to
congress
to
do
it.
in
this
situation
you
have
a
congress
that
knows
the
law,
wrote
the
law
in
1980.
if
the
law
is
no
longer
working
it
can
be
changed.
but
what
wasn't
changed
in
1980,
and
for
a
specific
purpose,
to
insure
rate
stability,
there
was
no
change
in
the
law
with
regard
to
the
posting
and
the
publicity
of
rates.
and
there
was
no
change
in
the
law
with
regard
to
the
reparations
scheme.
the
petitioner
and
the
government
now,
and
what's
most
interesting,
your
honors,
is
the
government
has
changed
its
position
180
degrees
in
6
years.
we
submitted,
attached
to
our
brief
is
a
brief
filed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
san
antonio,
it's
southern
pacific/san
antonio,
where
they
urge
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
subsequently
was
affirmed
in
the
bn
case
by
this
court,
to
not
stay
proceedings
while
the
icc
was
determining
the
level
of
the
rates.
why?
because
they
said
it
interfered
with
their
primary
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
portland
seed
and
also
in
square
d
had
made
the
determination
that
while
reasonableness
determinations
were
being
made
by
the
agency
the
rate,
the
legal
rate
still
controlled,
and
it
provided
no
defense
to
a
shipper
to
avoid
paying
that
rate.
because
again
following
the
earlier
precedent,
a
shipper
is
bound
to
pay,
and
this
is
not
equivocal,
it's
unequivocal,
bound
to
pay
the
legal
rate,
might
recover
reparations.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
your
cases
hold
that
a
negotiated
rate
has
no
legal
significance.
the
negotiated--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--it
is,
the
negotiated
rate
is
an
illegal
rate.
the
filed
rate
is
presumptively
legal
and
presumptively
lawful.
the
fact
that
the
rate
is
filed,
although
not
charged...
the
not
charging
of
the
filed
rate
does
not
imbue
the
filed
rate
with
any
unlawfulness.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
the
shipper
should
pay
at
the
time
the
filed
rate.
the
shippers
are
not
without
ability.
this
court
held
in
maislin
that
they
had,
and
it's
true,
that
they're
watching
services.
they
execute
a
bill
of
lading,
and
the
language
on
the
bill
of
lading
is
very,
very
specific.
it
says
received
subject
to
the
classifications
and
tariffs
on
file
with
the
icc
at
the
date
of
shipment.
so
it's
not
just
constructive
knowledge,
it's
actual
knowledge.
they're
signing
off
on
a
bill
of
lading
that
says
that.
it's
a
contract.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter
that
has
no
legal
significance.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
that's
what
happened...
well,
in
this
case
what
happened
was,
and
this
is
in
the
record,
the
trucker
wrote
the
shipper
a
letter
saying
don't
worry
about
our
tariffs,
we
will
handle
anything
that
pays
90
cents
a
mile.
so
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
decided
to
charge
knowingly
off
their
rates.
but
it
doesn't
matter
for
my
argument
because
i'm
going
to
concede
that
the
issue
of
constructive
knowledge
covers
both
issues,
covers
both
situations,
actual
knowledge
as
well
as
not
having
actual
knowledge.
if
the
court
is
going
to
give
legal
significance
to
this
illegal
rate
bargain
by
saying
that
it
provides
a
reparations
defense
out
of
whole
cloth,
one
that
is
not
allowed
within
the
statutory
scheme,
you
have
now
given
legal
significance
to
an
unfiled
rate,
you
have
sanctioned--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying,
and
if
you're
taking
a
totally
innocent
shipper
that
isn't
aware
of
the
higher
filed
rate
charges
the
position
is
well,
he
has
paid,
he
should
get
the
goods.
but
the
law
doesn't
say
payment...
it
says
payment
for
the
transportation
services
is
made.
now
what
is
payment
for
the
transportation
services?
is
that
just
paying
anything?
1
dollar
when
it
should
be
1,000
dollars?
no.
payment,
i
submit
that
under
the
statute
payment
is
payment
of
rates.
the
statute
10743
says
payment
of
rates.
that's
the
title
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
say
payment
of
charges.
it
says
payment
of
rates.
and
rates
are
only
one
thing,
what
is
on
file
with
the
icc.
and
that's
what
the
bill
of
lading
says,
and
that
is
what
the
shipper
must
do.
the
equities
do
not
count,
because
that
turns
the
statutory
scheme
on
its
head.
equities
can
be
looked
at
from
both
sides
of
the
fence.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
the
icc
had
that
policy
and
we--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--allegedly.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
well,
this
is
another
policy,
i
submit,
that
doesn't
square
with
the
statute
because
the
commission,
as
i
said,
have
just
changed
their
view.
because
negotiated
rates
failed.
that
was
their
answer
to
the
problem
that
they
created.
now,
that
being
taken
away
from
them,
they
now
have
a
reasonableness
philosophy
which
they
have
all
of
a
sudden
decided
that,
contrary
to
their
position
for
100
years,
now
all
of
a
sudden
shippers
are
no
longer
bound
to
pay,
but
they
might
have
to
pay,
but
let
us
decide
whether
they
are
reasonable
or
not.
but
now
only
in
a
bankruptcy
scenario,
not
in
actual
life.
well,
the
carriers
act
ongoing,
you're
not
going
to
enforce
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
you're
going
to
get
more
bankruptcies,
and
the
problem
is
going
to
continue
and
continue.
i
don't
think
you
reward
an
agency's
malfeasance
by
then
again
finding
another
exception
to
allow
them
off
the
hook.
congress
is
going
to
deal
with
this
agency.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
i,
the
way
to
treat
that--
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--well,
the
carrier
is
out
of
business.
the
carrier's
officers
can
go
to
jail.
there
are
criminal
penalty
provisions
which
can
be
enforced,
and
i
submit
the
icc
i
think
finally
is
coming
around
to
doing
that.
we
have
read
in
the
press
that
there
have
been
some
enforcement
actions,
finally.
that's
the
way
to
handle
the
people
who
created
the
malfeasance.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
yes.
definitely
post-maislin,
your
honor,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
i
can
appreciate
that
comment
as
well,
justice
stevens.
but
this
meaningful
opportunity
doctrine
is
an
equitable
principle,
and
you
can
search
that
act
from
the
10101
to
the
end
of
the
act
and
you
will
not
find
anything
that
speaks
to
deciding
cases
differently.
again,
the
principle
of
constructive
notice
has
been
a
part
of
this
jurisprudence
since
19...
arguably
since
1915
when
mr.
maxwell
wanted
to
go
to
the
world's
fair
by
xx
of
denver
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
to
pay
more
money.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
again
that's,
i
submit
that's
the
icc's
doing.
i
hate
to
come
back
to
that
part.
tariffs
do
not
have
to
be
complicated.
they
can
be
simplified,
and
they
should
be
simplified.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
i
do
tend
to
dispute
mr.
phillips
in
this
case.
i
don't
want
to
argue
too
much
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
was
involved
in
this
audit
and
this
is
a
very
simple
tariff.
and
certainly
his
client
who
receives
a
letter
saying
that
i'll
handle
anything
that
pays
90
cents
a
mile,
don't
worry
about
my
tariffs,
is
hard
to
question
that
he
even
bothered
to
open
or
crack
a
book
to
verify
the
rate.
but
watching
services
are
there
and
it
is
not
that
difficult.
and,
by
the
way,
if
it
is
difficult
the
shippers
are
not
without
remedy.
all
they
have
to
do
is
call
the
icc
up.
they
can
file
a
complaint
at
any
time
with
the
agency
requesting
tariffs
to
be
stricken,
modified,
or
changed.
if
they
don't
like
it,
let
them
complain
about
it.
but
what
they
don't
like
is
having
to
pay
filed
rate
charges
after
the
fact,
which
i
can
understand.
but
at
the
same
time
the
trustees
don't
like
the
fact
that
they're
left
with
clean
up
costs,
with
unpaid
wage
claims.
the
thing
is
a
mess,
and
we're
trying
to
simply
enforce
the
law
as
it
is
written.
we're
not
denying
the
reasonableness
here,
by
the
way.
in
carolina
motor
this
is
exactly
true.
if
they
were
truly
interested
in
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
they
could
have
done
so
under
the
bankruptcy
code
108(c),
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
had
their
full
2
years
available
to
them.
they
could
get
every
penny
that
any
other
claimant
could
have
gotten
had
they
chose
to
file
a
reparations
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
steinfeld,
jr.
--we
take.
but
there
are
rules
created
separately
for
the
united
states
of
america.
and
in
so
doing...
and
those
are
the
only
two
cases,
by
the
way.
the
court
should
note
this,
that
the
only
two
cases
that
they
rely
upon
are
u.s.
v.
western
pacific
and
u.s.
v.
pennsylvania
railroad,
both
tucker
act
cases.
those
are
the
only
cases
within
the
entire
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
have
provided
rate
reasonableness
as
a
defense,
only
because
of
the
set-off
provisions
under
the
tucker
act.
and
i
would
submit
if
congress
wishes
private
litigants
to
have
the
same
rights
they
sure
could
give
it
to
them.
if
there
are
any
other
questions.
if
not,
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
