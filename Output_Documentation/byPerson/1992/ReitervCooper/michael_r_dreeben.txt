mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
court
should
refer
to
the
icc
a
shipper's
defense
that
the
filed
rate
is
unreasonable
in
an
undercharge
action
brought
by
an
insolvent
carrier.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
for
three
reasons.
first,
referral
is
required
to
protect
the
icc's
primary
jurisdiction
over
the
reasonableness
of
rates.
second,
referral
is
necessary
to
give
the
shipper
an
effective
remedy
against
having
to
pay
unreasonable
rates
charged
under
a
carrier's
tariff.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
white,
we
don't
say
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
its
hand
if
the
shipper
did
have
an
effective
remedy
in
reparations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
is
this
case,
of
course.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
reason
why
reparations
is
inadequate
in
this
case
is
because
the
carrier
is
insolvent.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
don't
think
that
this
case
presents
the
court
with
the
requirement
of
ruling
on
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
united
states'
position
is
that
there
isn't
any
need
to
bring
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
into
play
through
a
referral
procedure
when
reparations
are
truly
available,
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
shipper
here
is
taking
any
position
that's
different
from
that.
the
whole
reason
why
this
issue
is
before
the
court
today
is
that
there
is
a
rash
of
collection
actions
throughout
the
motor
carrier
industry
in
which
bankrupt
carriers
or
their
trustees
are
culling
through
old
tariffs
and
seeking
to
collect
monies
that
are
substantially
in
excess
of
what
were
charged
at
the
time,
and
they
are
doing
so
in
a
way
that
gives
the
shippers
no
opportunity
to
challenge
the
reasonableness
of
those
rates
in
a
way
that
would
be
effective.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
think
the
rule
has
to
be
different
depending
on
the
fact
of
bankruptcy
or
not.
the
key
question
is
whether
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
in
reparations
that
would
allow
the
statutory
mechanism
to
work.
that
principle
is
exemplified
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
western
pacific
where
the
court
held
that
when
the
united
states'
reparation
action
was
time-barred
it
was
permitted
to
raise
the
defense
of
rate
unreasonableness
in
a
collection
action.
that
underlying
principle
was
also
expressed
in
this
court's
decision
in
crancer
v.
lowden
where
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
by
a
district
court
in
going
forward
with
a
collection
action
when
the
shipper
did
have
an
adequate
remedy
in
reparations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
mean,
justice
scalia,
the
same
thing
that
mr.
phillips
described,
and
this
court
has
used
the
same
sort
of
short-hand.
as
you
stated,
the
court
that's
hearing
the
action
in
which
an
issue
arises
that
can
only
be
decided
by
the
agency,
it
will
stay
its
proceedings
and
it
will
allow
the
parties
to
file
a
complaint
before
the
administrative
agency
in
order
to
raise
the
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
wouldn't
rule
out
the
possibility
of
a
court
sua
sponte
concluding
that
the
issue,
that
the
case
raised
an
issue
that
it
could
not
decide
and
that
an
agency
had
to
decide,
and
staying
its
proceedings
to
give
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
that
really
hasn't
been
a
problem
in
this
case
or
in
the
pattern
of
cases
in
this
industry.
shippers
have
been
seeking
to
bring
the
issue
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
issued
a
policy
statement
that
expresses
its
willingness
to
hear
on
complaint
precisely
this
kind
of
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
exactly
what
the
issue
is.
now,
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
every
case,
and
the
reason
is
that
it
would
defeat
the
operation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
what
we
have
here
are
two
statutory
provisions
that
are
applicable
to
the
same
transaction.
on
the
one
hand
the
carrier
is
required
to
charge
its
tariff
rate,
and
the
applicable
rate
in
this
case
is
the
tariff
rate,
not
the
negotiated
rate.
the
other
relevant
statutory
provision
is
the
requirement
that
the
tariff
rate
be
a
reasonable
rate.
if
it
is
not
a
reasonable
rate
it
is
not
enforceable.
what
the
carrier's
trustees
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
have
it
both
ways.
they
want
to
enforce
the
tariff
filing
requirement
extremely
strictly.
they
want
to
do
so
at
the
expense
of
the
requirement
that
the
tariff
be
reasonable,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
issue
wasn't
resolved
at
any,
in
the
lower
courts
at
all,
and
we
think
that
the
case
should
be
returned
to
the
lower
courts
for
them
to
address
it.
in
general--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
souter.
we
do
think
that
when
a
significant
discrepancy
exists
between
the
negotiated
or
charged
rate
that
was
paid
at
the
time
and
the
tariff
rate,
that
that
may
raise
an
issue,
and
it
also
raises
an
issue
of
reasonableness
when
the
tariff
rate
is
substantially
higher
than
what
the
prevailing
market
rate
was.
the
icc
has
recently
clarified
that
that
is
the
key
to
a
reasonable
rate
in
the
current
competitive
market
environment.
so
it
shouldn't
be
very
difficult
for
courts
to
be
able
to
determine
when
referral
is
appropriate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
think
that
the
issue
should
still
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
in
that
setting
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
not
reward
the
shipper's
violation
of
the
discrimination
provision
of
the
act
by
giving
it
the
benefit
of
a
ruling.
but
those
issues
and
the
interrelation
of
the
statute
in
that
question
raises
core
questions
for
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
balance.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
then
be
entitled
to
deference
under
this
court's
chevron
line
of
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly.
i
would
add,
justice
scalia,
that
there's
been
no
experience
in
the
markets
today
of
that
kind
of
deliberate
discrimination
and
then
a
claim
of
unreasonableness
being
raised.
we
do
have
a
fairly
unique
market
situation
today
where
the
tariff
rates
that
were
on
file
for
a
certain
small
percentage
of
carriers
were
far,
far
higher
than
the
rates
that
were
being
charged
in
the
market,
and
the
result
of
this
was
that
many
of
these
carriers
when
they
went
out
of
business
did
have
the
opportunity
to
come
back
later
under
their
tariffs.
the
industry
as
a
whole
was
not
ignoring
its
tariff
filing
requirements,
however.
there
were
about
1.2
million
tariffs
filed
each
year
that
correctly
reflected
the
rates
that
were
being
charged,
and
it's
that
body
of
information
that
provides
a
substantial
source
for
saying
that
these
higher
tariff
rates
that
were
not
modified
don't
conform
to
the
statutory
requirement
of
reasonableness.
and
that's
what
makes
it
so
important
to
get
the
issue
before
the
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
general
principle
we're
contending
for
today
is
that
under
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
when
the
carrier
is
insolvent
the
reasonableness
defense
would
be
worthless
and
meaningless
unless
there
is
a
stay
of
proceedings
and
an
opportunity
for
the
commission--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
this
context,
yes.
again,
we
think
that's
an
example
of
the
general
principle
that
the
court
applied
in
western
pacific.
there
the
carrier
had
more
years
to
sue
for
an
undercharge
than
the
shipper
did
to
sue
for
reparations,
and
the
shipper,
in
that
case
the
united
states,
if
it
had
had
to
pay
an
undercharge
would
never
have
been
able
to
challenge
reasonableness
before
the
icc.
in
that
setting
the
court
said
the
reasonableness
defense
must
be
referred
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
same
principle
we
think
applies
when
the
carrier's
insolvency
or
other
factors
preclude
the
opportunity
of
a
shipper
to
raise
the
reasonableness
issue
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'll
answer
your
second
question
first.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
has
taken
approximately
2.5
years
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
formulate
its
basic
standard
of
what
it
is
going
to
use
for
reasonableness
claims.
it
picked
a
lead
case,
it
developed
an
opinion,
and
now
that
that
opinion
has
been
issued
the
commission
anticipates
that
it
will
be
able
to
resolve
these
claims
more
quickly.
of
course
if
the
administrative
action
is
unreasonably
delayed
then
there
are
remedies
under
the
apa
to
get
the
commission
to
move
faster,
and
i
suppose
that
a
district
court
would
have
discretion
to
say
we
have
given
the
agency
a
chance,
it
hasn't
answered,
that's
the
end
of
that.
now--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
this
is
what
we're
talking
about
as
a
process
of
accommodation
of
policies,
not
an
all
one
way
rule
or
all
the
other
way
rule.
now
as
to
your--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
to
your
first
question,
justice
scalia,
whether
referral
should
be
automatic
no
matter
how
transparently
flimsy
or
false
the
claim
of
unreasonableness
is,
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
and
i
think
that
this
is
just
a
classic
example
of
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
at
work.
the
court
has
to
be
satisfied
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
for
the
agency
to
resolve.
this
does
not
require
the
court
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
of
whether
a
rate
is
reasonable.
it
just
requires
the
court
to
look
at
the
kind
of
showing
that
shippers
typically
make.
we
paid
this
rate,
we
were
quoted
this
rate
and
rates
around
it
by
several
other
people
in
the
market,
tariffs
reflect
this
rate,
and
now
the
carrier
is
seeking
to
charge
a
rate
substantially
in
excess
of
what
it
charged
us
at
the
time.
that
should
be
enough
for
a
court
to
stay
its
hand
and
afford
the
agency
the
chance
to
pass
on
the
claim.
so
there
shouldn't
really
be
any
difficulty
with
respect
to
courts
administering
a
rule
that
we
propose.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
compelled
to
bar
the
procedure
that
we
advocate
in
this
case
because
of
its
reliance
on
the
filed
rate
doctrine
and
on
this
court's
recent
decision
in
maislin.
the
filed
rate
doctrine
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
court
can
stay
a
collection
action
and
refer
a
case
to
the
commission.
the
filed
rate
doctrine
says
that
defenses
such
as
ignorance
of
the
tariff
rate
or
misquotation
of
the
rate
are
not
an
obstacle
to
application
of
the
tariff
rate.
we
agree.
the
tariff
rate
is
the
applicable
rate
here.
but
the
filed
rate
doctrine
has
nothing
to
say
about
whether
reasonableness
can
be
asserted
as
a
defense
and
referred
to
the
commission,
and
in
fact
this
court's
decision
in
maislin--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
white,
and
again
the
shipper
cannot
use
this
as
a
way
to
avoid
payment
of
the
filed
rate
at
the
time
of
shipment
because
there
is
an--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--even
if
he
thinks
it's
unreasonable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
there
is
an
independent
statutory
requirement
that
the
shipper
must
pay
at
the
time
of
delivery.
but
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
which
reflects
some
statutory
requirements,
does
not
include
any
requirement
that
a
shipper
must
pay
before
having
reasonableness
litigated
when
there
is
absolutely
no
other
opportunity
to
have
the
issue
of
reasonableness
litigated.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
if
the
time
for
reparations--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--then
it's
clear
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
western
pacific
that
the
case
must
be
referred
to
the
commission.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
statutory
provision
applies
at
the
time
the
goods
are
delivered.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
now,
reparations
can
be
asserted
for
2
years
under
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
an
undercharge
action
can
be
brought
for
3
years.
so
you
can
have
the
odd
situation
where
if
the
carrier
doesn't
insist
on
collecting
the
tariff
rate
at
the
time
of
the
shipment
it
can
wait
3
years,
bring
an
undercharge
action,
and
then
any
reparations
proceeding
before
the
icc
is
time-barred.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
true,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
shipper
does
that
because
that's
what
the
carrier
is
billing
him.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
and
in
this
case
there
was
actually
representations
made
to
the
shippers
that
the
rate
would
be
filed
in
the
tariff,
so
they
had
a
reason
to
expect
that
that
was
the
filed
rate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
