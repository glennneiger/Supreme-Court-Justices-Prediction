m.
kennedy
well,
just
before
you
leave
that
point,
it's
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
a
district
court
or
bankruptcy
court
can
alter
the
priority
of
creditors
by
an
equitable
subordination
of
liens
that
are
otherwise
equal.
i
mean,
where,
where
do
you
get
that
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
bankruptcy
courts
could
do
this
they
could
have
escrows
all
the
time
which
would
basically
alter
the
provision
the
congress
has
for
the
priority
of
creditors
and
for
their
equal
right
to
share
in
proceeds.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
see
where
this
authority
comes
from.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
argue
this
in
your
brief
and
there's
no
citation
in
the
brief
to
support
the
bankruptcy
court's
authority
to
do
this,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
under
the
bankruptcy
law
in
your
tire
manufacturer
hypothetical,
if
the
tire
manufacturer
had
a
claim
he
could
set-off
any
amount
that
was
owed
to
the
company.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you're
talking
about
equivalency,
the
only
reason
there
can't
be
a
set-off
here
is
because
it's
not
a
post-petition
debt
because
of
the
reasonableness
doctrine
hasn't
been
adjudicated
yet.
