mr.
dreeben...
go
ahead,
you
didn't
answer
the
first
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
none
of
the
solvent
carriers
brought
any
of
these
lawsuits,
none
of
them
were
brought
until
they
went
into
bankruptcy,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
where
solvent
carriers
are
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
out
of
millions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
percentage
of
the
total
market
do
you
think
was
paying
the
filed
rate
during
the
period
in
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
still
went
bankrupt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
one
carrier,
you
say.
i'm
talking
about
the
market
as
a
whole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
prevalent
was
this
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
billions
of
dollars
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
majority
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
these,
a
lot
of
these
cases,
your
position
is
just
as
strong
even
if
there
is
no
discrimination
at
all
by
the
carrier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
they
charged
just
the
market
rate
across
the
board
your
anti-discrimination
policy
still
takes
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
also
creates
many
ills.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why.
the
statute
has
been
so
clear
for
100
years,
i
don't
know
why
you
limit
it
to
post-maislin.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
must
admit
the
tariffs
got
a
little
more
complicated
after
the
motor
carriers
were
regulated
than
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
they
really
aren't,
as
you
well
know.
i
mean,
mr.
phillips
gave
you
one
example,
several
hundred
pages
sometimes.
