justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
mr.
phillips,
as
i
recall
your
brief
you
ask
that
the,
what
should
happen
is
the
bankruptcy
court
should
refer
this
matter
to
the
icc?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
authority
does
it
have
to
refer
it?
i
mean,
i
have
heard
of,
you
know,
where
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
applies
i
have
heard
of
courts
staying
proceedings
until
one
of
the
parties
had
an
opportunity
to
make
use
of
an
available
proceeding
before
the
icc
or
the
fcc
or
another
agency,
but
i
have
never
heard
of
a
power
in
the
court
to
direct
an
agency
to
make
some
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
there
a
proceeding
before
the
icc
that
would
enable
you
to
do
that?
i
mean,
is
there
a
mechanism--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whereby
if
the
court
stays
its
hand
you
can
get
this
issue
before
the
icc?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
at
the
outset
of
your
presentation
you
referred
to
referral
to
the
icc
is
necessary
for
three
reasons,
and
you
repeated
the
referral.
what
do
you
mean
by
referral
to
the
icc?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
up
to
the
parties
to
take
the
initiative
to
go
before
the
agency,
and
up
to
the
agency
to
accept
that
proceeding
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
all
we're
really
talking
about
is
a
stay
of
proceedings
which
the
bankruptcy
court
undoubtedly
has
the
power
to
achieve,
and
the
issue
is
simply
whether
it's
appropriate
in
this
situation
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
what
if
it
comes
out
in
the
proceedings
before
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
shipper
in
fact
was
the
only
shipper
who
was
getting
this
special
rate
and
that
he
and
the
carrier
colluded
and
the
carrier
said
look,
we're
charging
everybody
else,
all
your
competitors,
this
excessive
unreasonable
rate,
but
you
we're
going
to
give
a
fair
rate
to.
you
still
think
that
with
all...
when
the
equities
are
like
that
you
would
have
to
send
it,
you
would
have
to
stay
your
hand?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
the
icc
might
just
simply
refuse
to
entertain
the
proceeding
for
equitable...
could
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
frame
the
threshold
test
for
the
reference
to
the
agency?
is
it
the
likelihood
of
recovery
or
the
insolvency
of
the
carrier
or
the
fact
that
the
carrier
is
in
bankruptcy?
what's
the
general
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
turns
on
the
carrier's
solvency?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
this
is
an
automatic
referral?
i
mean,
no
matter
how
outrageous
the
claim
of
unreasonableness
is,
all
the
debtor
has
to
say
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
unreasonable
rate
and
it
automatically
stays
everything
and
goes
over
to
the
icc?
how
long
will
it
take
in
the
icc?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
those
companies
that
charged,
all
the
companies
that
charged
low
rates
have
gone
bankrupt?
is
that
what
happened?
that's
a
strange
market
phenomenon.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
inefficient
ones,
i
gather,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
efficient
ones
stay
in
business
and
continue
to
charge
people
low
rates.
that's
basically
what
happens,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
post-maislin,
i
hope.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
that
the
essential
injustice?
i
mean
the
essential
injustice
here
is
an
injustice
that
you
concede
is
there
in
the
act,
that
the
carrier
who
was
at
fault
for
all
of
this
can
nonetheless
come
and
collect
the
rate,
and
if
he
happens
to
go
insolvent
the
next
day
you're
just
straight
out
of
luck.
isn't
that
the
essential
injustice?
and
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
there
in
the
statute.
