justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
the
filed
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
even
if
the
carrier
filed,
charged,
sent
a
bill
for
the
filed
rate
and
the
shipper
said
the
rate
is
unreasonable,
should
that
defense
await
a
ruling
by
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
negotiated
rate
was
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
a
rate,
it
was
a
negotiated
rate
that
the
carrier
had
no
business
charging?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
shipper
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
carrier
had
an
effective
remedy
to
recover
reparations?
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
its
hand?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
not
apply,
you
would
not
apply,
you
would
not
apply
primary
jurisdiction
where
the
carrier,
where
the
shipper
paid
a
negotiated
rate
that
was
lower
than
the
filed
rate
and
the
carrier
then
sued
for
the
balance?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
but
absent,
if
the
carrier...
if
the
shipper
had
a
opportunity
for
reparations
you
would
not
apply
the
primary
jurisdiction
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i
know,
but
what's
the
united
states'
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do,
you
do
not
agree
with
the
shipper
here
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
say
that
the
shipper
pay
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest,
though,
that
if
the
carrier
has
charged
the
filed
rate
that
the
shipper
can
just
raise
the
defense
of
unreasonableness
unless
there's
some
claim
that
he
can't
get
reparations?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
he
thinks
it's
unreasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there's
a
pretty
good
case
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
happens
to
the
rule
that
you
have
to
pay
when
the
service
is
rendered
if
the
shipper
claims,
well,
i
know
that
rule
and
the
carrier
is
charging
me
the
filed
rate,
but
nevertheless
the
time
for
reparations
has
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens,
what
happens
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
this
statutory
provision
that
you've
got
to
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you,
what
do
you
do
to
the
assertions
that
the
filed
rate
can't
be
collected
or
need
not
be
collected
until
the
icc
gets
to
pass
on
it
if
there's
no
reasonable
way
of
getting
reparations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about,
what
do
you
do
about
western
pacific?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
a
tucker
act
case,
but
they
were
just
trying
to
collect
a
higher
rate
than
had
been
charged
to
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
western
pacific
applied
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
among
other
things
to
have
the
icc
decide
reasonableness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't
make
the
united
states
pay
the
filed
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
again,
what
if
reparations
are
not
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
reparations,
maybe
you
could
say,
maybe
you
could
say
that
the
icc
could
decide...
what
would
you
do,
bring
a
suit
for
reparations?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
you
might
get
a
judgment
but
it
can
never
be
collected.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
shipper
should
pay
the
filed
rate,
pay
up
and
then
file
a
claim
like
any
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
more
illegal
rate
bargains
there
were
for
lower
rates,
the
more
likely
it
would
be
that
the
carrier
would
go
bankrupt.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think,
you
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
our
cases
hold
that
a
negotiated
rate
below
the
filed
rate
is
an
illegal
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
illegal?
is
it
a
legal
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
shipper
should
pay
at
the
time
the
filed
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't,
i
don't
know.
certainly
the
icc
did
have
a
policy
for,
until
maislin,
i
suppose,
of
encouraging
negotiated
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
were,
they
were
regulating
this
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
allegedly.
they
were.
they
just
happened
to,
it
turns
out
they,
it
turns
out
that
one
of
their
policies
didn't
square
with
the
statute,
at
least
this
court
held.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we're
not
talking
about,
we're
not
talking
about
how
we
should
treat
the
icc.
we're
trying
to,
we're
talking
about
how
to
treat
the
shipper--
justice
byron
r.
white
--who
has
been,
who
perhaps
mistakenly
relied
on
an
icc
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
say
nothing
of
the
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
now
that
the
plan
of
liquidation
has
been
affirmed
and
the
stay
has
been
lifted,
obviously
the
time
has
occurred,
has
departed.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
western
pacific
was
clearly
acting
on
its
rights
under
the
tucker
act.
why
would
congress...
query
this.
why
would
congress
give
the
u.s.
government
the
absolute
right
to
raise
reasonableness
as
a
defense
through
a
set-off
procedure
if
it
didn't
have
to?
it
had
to
because
the
united
states
government
didn't
want
to
be
bound,
as
is
often
the
case,
to
do
what
everybody
else
is
doing.
first
of
all
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
insolvency,
thankfully,
of
the
u.s.
government.
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
time--
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
that's
a
little
bit
of
an
overstatement.
i
thought
you
conceded
long
ago
that
if
the,
if
the
carrier
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
get
reparations
that
the
carrier
could
sue
you
for
the
difference
between
the
negotiated
rate
and
the
filed
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
do,
then
you
did,
you
had
to
have
had
a
duty
to
pay
the
filed
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
couldn't
rely
on
what
the
carrier
said,
then.
if
the
carrier
could
collect
the
filed
rate
from
you,
you
had
a
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
nevertheless
the
carrier
could
come
back
and
collect
the
filed
rate
from
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
an
adequate
reparations
remedy.
