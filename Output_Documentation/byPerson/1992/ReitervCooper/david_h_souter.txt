in
a
situation
like
this
in
which
bankruptcy
is
the
context
in
which
the
issue
arises,
is
there
any
issue
of
discretion
in
your
view
on
the
part
of
the
bankruptcy
court
once
it
determines
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
about
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
fail
to
stay
in
other
words
if
there
is
no
question
about
the
genuineness
of
the
issue
of
reasonableness?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
question
about
there
being
a
genuine
claim
of
reasonableness
here?
could
that
be
disputed?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
you
said
that
in
your
brief,
actually,
didn't
you?
