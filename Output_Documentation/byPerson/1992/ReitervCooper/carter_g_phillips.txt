mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
is
required
in
this
case
to
reconcile
two
core
commands
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
first
is
that
the
carrier
shall
charge
and
collect
only
the
filed
tariff
rate,
and
the
second
is
that
the
carrier
shall
not
charge
or
collect
a
rate
that
is
unreasonable.
in
this
case
petitioners,
who
previously
paid
all
that
the
carrier
charged
in
order
to
ship
goods,
have
been
ordered
in
effect
to
pay
what
they
claim
to
be
unreasonably
high
rates.
petitioners,
on
behalf
of
the
entire
shipping--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was
the
filed
rate,
yes,
your
honor,
the
one
that
petitioners
take
the
position
and
argue
in
defense
that
it
was
unreasonably
high.
petitioners
on
behalf
of
the
entire
shipping
industry,
which
faces
claims
similar
to
this
one
in
amounts
in
excess
of
billions
of
dollars,
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
categorical
approach
proposed
by
the
respondents
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
court
rejected
an
all
or
nothing
solution
to
this
same
problem
2
years
ago
in
the
maislin
decision.
instead
what
the
court
should
do
is
to
resolve,
is
to
have
these
issues
resolved
on
a
case-by-case
basis
with
the
issue
of
the
rate
reasonableness
decided
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
subject
to
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
exercise
of
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no,
justice
white,
that
defense
should
not
await
a
ruling.
in
that
situation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--section
10743,
a
separate
provision,
separate
from
the
filed
rate
doctrine
which
is
embodied
in
section
10761(a),
specifically
provides
that
the
carrier
has
a
right
to
insist
upon
payment
at
the
time
of
the
movement
of
the
goods.
and
that
is
the
source
of
the
pay
first
rule
which
is
essentially
a
rule
that
the
court
has
acknowledged
in
passing
on
a
number
of
old
cases,
but
that
rule
has
a
separate
statutory
basis.
it's
not
inherent
in
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
and
therefore
our
position
is
that
if
you
insist
on
the
payment,
and
even
if
the
payment
is
too
high
in
your
judgment,
you
are
obliged
to
follow
that
because
congress
made
a
specific
determination
that
that's
the
proper
course
to
follow.
in
contrast,
justice
white,
in
this
case
where
the
payments
were
made
in
full
and
then
additional
sums
were
requested
that
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--a
negotiated
rate
was
paid
and
then
a
subsequent
request
was
made.
nothing
in
the
statute
specifically
deals
with
that
particular
situation,
and
when
you're
in
a
no-man's
land
then
it
seems
to
us
a
different
set
of
rules
ought
to
apply.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true.
the
carrier
was,
acted
unlawfully
in
charging
that
rate
at
the
time.
he
should
have
filed
those
rates.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
if
you...
the
provision,
section
19761
and
10762
both
provide
that
it
is
the
carrier's
duty
to
comply
with
the
law.
certainly
the
shipper
has
an
interest,
and
after
maislin
has
an
interest
that
is
quite
significant
in
insuring
that
the
tariffs
are
in
fact
filed,
but
the
duty
itself
clearly
resides
with
the
carrier
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
true
in
a
theoretical
sense
that
the
shipper
has
access,
but
i
think
it
is
as
a
practical
matter
quite
unreasonable
to
expect
the
shipper
to
be
able
consistently
to
monitor
changing
tariff
rates
that
can
be
implemented
on
24-hours
notice,
when
if
you
were
to
just
look
at
the
carolina
tariffs
they
are
six
volumes
long,
they
reference
additional
tariffs
that
are
themselves
three
and
four
volumes
long.
we're
talking
about
tariff
filings
that
are
in
the
nature
of
thousands
of
pages,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
to
some
portions
they
would
have
been,
some
of
the
earlier
shipments
i
think
would
have
been
barred.
later
shipments
would
not
have
been
barred.
so
we're
not
in
the
more,
i
think
more
typical
situation
where
the
trustee
has
brought
the
suit
for
undercharges
at
a
period
in
time
when
the
shippers
are
not
permitted
to
seek
reparations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
western
pacific
where
the
court
held
that
where
the
united
states
refused
to
pay
and
was
sued
for
undercharges
and
the
carriers,
the
carrier
in
that
case,
just
as
the
respondents
in
this
case,
said
the
way
to
do
this
is
to
pay
the
filed
rate
and
seek
reparations.
and
the
court
said
that's,
you
can't
do
that
because
reparations
are
time-barred.
and
in
language
that
i
think
is
strikingly
appropriate
for
this
particular
case
the
court
said
to
hold
otherwise
would
require
the
court
to
condone
a
situation
where
the
carrier
is
permitted
to
obtain
unreasonable
rates
with
impunity.
that
is
precisely
the
situation
that
we
have
here
because
everyone
conceded
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
that
if
these
rates
turn
out
to
be
unreasonable
they
are
essentially
lost
because
the
carrier
is
insolvent
and
it's
going
to
be
impossible
to
recoup
monies.
under
those
circumstances
what
you
have
is
a
situation
where
the
shipper's
significant
right
under
the
statute
not
to
be
charged
unreasonable
rates
is
essentially
vitiated
in
favor
of
an
unbending
absolute
rule
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
which
this
court
has
never
held
to
be
applicable
in
that
particular
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
bankruptcy
court,
i
think
there's
no
question
the
bankruptcy
court
would
have
that
authority.
the
problem
with
that
particular
approach
is,
first
of
all
there's
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
would
authorize
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
categorically
denied
us
the
opportunity
to
stay
the
payment
and
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
bankruptcy
court
or
the
fourth
circuit's
analysis
that
even
envisions
that
kind
of
a
procedure.
so
it's
not
really
in
the
case.
but
second
of
all,
in,
given
the
magnitude
of
the
undercharges
that
are
at
issue
here
it
seems
quite
extraordinary
to
think
about
billions
of
dollars
being
placed
in
the
registry
when
there
is
no
serious
reason
to
wonder
whether
in
fact
these
charges
are
reasonable.
in
fact
the
more
likely
scenario
is
that
these
charges
are
quite
unreasonable,
having
not
been
reviewed
as
they
have
increased
over
the
period
of
time.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
us
the
more
appropriate
course
is
if
a
carrier
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
shipper
will
be
unable
to
pay
the
filed
rate
if
ultimately
determined
to
be
reasonable,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
shipper,
or,
excuse
me,
the
carrier
can
come
forward
in
either
the
bankruptcy
court
or
before
the
icc
and
seek
to
have
some
protection
put
in
place.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
question
is
whether
you
put
it
into
the
bankruptcy
estate
in
the
first
instance.
i
agree
with
you,
once
it
gets
into
the
bankrupt
estate
it's
clear
that
you
can't
modify
how
the
creditors
receive--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
doesn't...
i
mean,
to
be
honest
with
you
i'm
happy
to
abandon
the
position
that
there's
authority
to
do
it.
i
would
have
been
inclined
to
assume
that
as
an
equitable
matter
the
bankruptcy
court
could,
given
that
we
don't
know
the
legality,
the
underlying
legality,
and
it's
necessary
to
have
the
issue
resolved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
exercise
of
its
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
no,
your
honor,
there
is
none.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
any
one
of
the
courts
would
have
been
fine,
but
yes,
your
honor,
since
it
was
tried
initially
before
the
bankruptcy
court
we
thought
the
matter
should
have
been
referred
to
the
icc.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
may
well
be
that
we
are
simply
employing
a
short-hand
means
of
accomplishing
precisely
what
you're
describing,
justice
scalia.
it's
not
so
much
that
we
care
that
the
matter
be
specifically
referred
by
any
court
to
the
icc,
but
that
we
have
an
opportunity
as
shippers
to
have
the
rate
reasonableness
determined
initially
by
the
icc.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
yes,
i
mean
the
interstate
commerce--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
a
policy
statement,
order
177
and
208,
both
of
which
say
that
they
will
entertain
these
kinds
of
claims
and
resolve
the
question
of
rate
reasonableness,
and
in
fact
in
the
oneida
case
that
was
recently
decided
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
is
precisely
what
they
did
do.
they
undertook
to
decide
the
rate
reasonableness
issue
and
went
forward.
so
there
are,
there
is
a
mechanism,
to
be
sure.
let
me
just
add
one
last
idea,
or
at
least
one
set
of
concepts
to
the
mix
in
this
case.
one
significant
line
of
decisions
from
this
court
that
it
seems
to
me
supports
the
underlying
decision
of
the
icc
to
provide
this
relief
is
the
interstate
commerce
commission
v.
american
trucking
associations
case,
where
this
court
has
upheld
extraordinary
remedies
in
situations
where
they
were
directly
aimed
at
a
particular
problem
that
the
statute
otherwise
does
not
remedy,
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
case
is
about.
because
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
has
taken
a
contrary
view
its
judgment
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
quick
points.
first
of
all
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
steinfeld
suggested
that
the
shippers
in
this
case
were
informed
that
the
rates
would
not
be
filed
and
therefore
acted
essentially
at
their
own
peril.
what
that
letter
actually
says
just
prior
to
the
reference
to
what
rates
were
going
to
be
charged
is,
i'm
not
sending
you
the
tariff
because
it
is,
quote,
voluminous,
and
you
need
not
worry
about
it
though
because
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
take
care
of
this
in
a
filed
tariff.
so
the
truth
is
that
the
shippers
did
rely.
it's
ultimately
not
terribly
important
to
the
outcome
of
the
case,
but
it's
important
to
set
that
record
straight.
with
respect
to
the
idea
that
there
was
either
collusion
or
discrimination
in
this
case,
that's
nonsense.
this
is
a
shipper
who...
these
are
brokers,
small
brokers.
they
don't
have
any
market
power.
they
use
15
different
carriers.
all
15
of
those
carriers
charge
precisely
the
same
rate.
and
in
fact
if
you
look
at
the
carrier's
tariffs
in
this
case,
they
have
tariffs
that
look
very
similar
for
other
shippers
to
the
rates
that
they
charged
here,
they
just
didn't
bother
to
file
those
tariffs
for
this
particular
shipper.
so
what
happened
here
is
clearly
just
malfeasance.
he
talks
about
the
malfeasance
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
how
it
approached
this
case.
i
find
it
incredibly
mystifying
to
sit
here
and
say
that
we
have
erred
because
we
failed
to
exercise
constructive
knowledge
when
it's
obvious
that
from
the
beginning
the
carriers
had
an
obligation
to
charge
and
collect
the
filed
rate.
they
chose
not
to
do
so.
they
charged
a
different
rate.
and
to
suggest
that
somehow
at
the
outset
of
this
process
under
section
10743
that
we
had
some
duty
to
come
back
to
them
and
say,
sir,
you
have
undercharged
us,
you
need
to
expect
more
out
of
us,
is
ridiculous
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
it
is
absolutely
clear--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
there
is
no
risk
in
pursuing
reparations,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
did
have...
i
had
a
duty
to
pay
the
filed
rate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
the
time
of
shipment
all
the
scheme
requires
is,
and
i
quote
the
language,
justice
white,
only
when
payment
for
the
transportation
of
service
is
provided.
it
doesn't
say
the
filed
rate.
it
says
the
payment.
and
we
made
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
may
come
back--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
of
course
the
one
question
that
mr.
steinfeld
asked
is
how
will
we
know
who
is
solvent,
when.
well,
i
don't
know
how
we'll
know
who's
solvent
in
the
future,
but
the
one
thing
i
know
absolutely
is
who
is
insolvent
today,
and
that's
carolina
motors.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
acknowledge
that
it's
there
in
the
statute
as
a
timing
issue
at
the
outset
when
the
payment,
when
the
shipment
is
delivered
and
there
is
a
requirement
of
payment.
at
that,
in
that
circumstance
there
is
an
injustice.
but
after
that
circumstance,
in
the
case
that
we
have
here,
justice
scalia,
where
payment
is
made,
you
come
back
later,
that
injustice
no
longer
applies
because
the
icc
has
said
to
the
contrary.
thank
you.
