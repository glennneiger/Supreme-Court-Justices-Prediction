justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
saying
that
even
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
i
mean,
can't
you
tell
at
the
beginning,
assuming
your
client
is
right,
would
there
be
any
reason
why
the
judge
wouldn't
have
discretion
not
to
grant
your
relief
if
he
goes
ahead
with
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
suggesting
that
if
you
win
on
those...
if
you
prove
what
you've
alleged
he'd
have
discretion
not
to
give
you
relief
on
these
facts,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
abandoned
your
suggestion
in
your
brief
that
there's
a
federal
issue
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
paid
much
attention
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
just
so...
i
don't
know
whether
it's
actually
in
this
record
or
not,
but
supposing
the
state
court
had
a
3-year
delay
on
getting
to
trial
and
the
federal
court's
calendar
was
current,
because
one
of
the
things
they
always
did
was
dismiss
all
of
their
declaratory
judgment
cases--
[laughter]
would
that
be
a
factor
that
the
judge
should
weigh
in
deciding
whether
to
dismiss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
condition
here?
does
the
record
tell
us
which
court
was
more
current?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he...
there's
something
he
should
have
considered
but
it's
not
in
the
record,
so
we
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how...
because
you
filed,
what,
within
30
or
40
days,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
make
a
difference
if
it
was
90
days
later?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
the
defendant
in
the
federal
action
was
able
to
get
three
or
four
continuances
before
filing
his
answer,
and
then
filed
the
state
action,
that
would
still
be
a
duty
to
dismiss
and
let
the
state
action
go
forward.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the
factors
here
except
for
the
one
fact
that
there's
a
state
action
pending?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
guess
you
say
you
want
to
bring
in
another
party,
too,
don't
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
the
court
give
any
consideration
to
the
reason
why
there
is
diversity
jurisdiction,
the
neutral
forum
argument?
does
that
have
any
relevance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
the
court
give
any
consideration
of
the
possibility
of
a
federal
question
being
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
consideration
does
the
district
judge
give
to
those
factors
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
one
party
guilty
of
more
forum
shopping
than
the
other
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
of
you
has
a
forum
you'd
prefer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
they
would
have
reversed,
but
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
appealable
order,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
wouldn't
have
reversed
after
the
whole
trial,
would
they,
and
have
said
you
shouldn't
have
the
trial?
