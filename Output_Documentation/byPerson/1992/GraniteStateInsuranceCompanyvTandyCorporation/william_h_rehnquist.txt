chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-2086,
the
granite
state
insurance
company
v.
the
tandy
corporation.
ms.
webb.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
webb,
are
you
assuming
that
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
that
respect
is
the
same
as
an
action
for
an
injunction
or
for
damages
because
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
which
you
set
forth
in
your
brief
at
page
3
says
that
the
district
court
may
declare
the
rights.
it
certainly
suggests
discretion
to
do
so
or
not
to
do
so,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
the
brillhart
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
were
all
of
the
cases
that
you
described
as
the
more
modern
cases,
did
those
all
involve
declaratory
judgments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
court
action
had
been
filed
first?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
it's
not
an
unflagging
obligation.
there
may
be
considerations
based
on
state
court
litigation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't...
you
would
say
they
shouldn't
defer
even
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
contrary
to
a
long
line
of
authority
at
common
law,
that
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
and
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
indicates
that
you
use
the
same
principles
there
as...
is
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
court.
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
you
may
not
issue
an
injunction
even
though
the
party
has
made
out
a
good
case
on
the
law,
as
opposed
to
the
common
law
claim
for
damages
where
there
isn't
any
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
does
that
do
to
your
position,
if
that's
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
webb.
ms.
liberato.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
they're
getting
to
trial
in
the
federal
court
faster
than
they
used
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
way
you
have
of
comparing
the
time
of
getting
to
trial
in
the
state
court
with
the
time
of
getting
to
trial
in
the
federal
court
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
liberato.
ms.
webb,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
webb.
the
case
is
submitted.
