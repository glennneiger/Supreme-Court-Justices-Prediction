mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
only
one
issue
in
this
case
which
is
truly
uncontested.
granite
state
and
tandy
had
been
engaged
in
a
significant
coverage
dispute
for
over
2
years
beginning
several
months
before
granite
state
filed
suit.
in
an
effort
to
resolve
an
escalating
problem,
granite
state
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
federal
court
using
a
remedy
expressly
granted
by
congress
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
both
jurisdiction
and
venue
were
proper
in
houston.
nonetheless,
the
district
court
stayed
this
action
in
deference
to
a
later-filed
state
court
action
filed
almost
a
month
later
by
tandy
in
fort
worth,
texas.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
by
giving
the
district
court
virtually
unfettered
discretion
to
defer
to
the
state
courts,
the
fifth
circuit
has
judicially
eviscerated
an
affirmative
legislative
remedy.
granite
state
is
here
today
asking
this
court
to
reinstate
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
there
are
two
questions
presented
by
this
appeal.
the
first
is
whether
a
district
court
with
unquestioned
jurisdiction
can
abstain
from
hearing
an
action
validly
before
it
simply
because
of
the
presence
of
a
later-filed
state
court
action.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
abstention
decision
of
the
district
court
is
reviewed
de
novo
or
for
abuse
of
discretion.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
comity
and
federalism
issued
presented
by
abstention
decisions,
it
is
important
that
courts
of
appeals
stringently
address...
stringently
review
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
the
pendency
of
a
parallel
action
is
always
a
consideration
in
an
abstention
decision.
there
is
no
abstention
decision
unless
there
is
a
parallel
state
court
action.
this
cannot
be
an
exceptional
circumstance
which
will
justify
abstention
from
a
federal
court's
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
its
valid
jurisdiction.
in
determining
whether
an
abstention
decision
is
appropriate,
a
federal
court
must
begin
with
one
of
the
fundamental
precepts
of
our
federal
judicial
system,
and
this
court
has
stated
that
federal
courts
have
no
more
right
to
decline
the
exercise
of
valid
jurisdiction
than
to
usurp
that
which
is
not
given.
the
one
or
the
other
is
treasonous
to
the
constitution.
abstention
is
an
extraordinary
and
narrow
exception
to
a
federal
court's
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
its
valid
jurisdiction.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
your
honor,
there
seems
to
be
some
discretion
in
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
we
believe
the
discretion
is
not
whether
or
not
a
district
court
may
hear
the
case,
but
whether
or
not
the
district
court
may
grant
the
release
asked
for.
there
are
many
occasions
in
which
declaratory
relief
is
sought,
but
declaratory
relief
isn't
appropriate
for
one
reason
or
another.
for
example,
in
the
grow
case,
it's...
the
voting
rights
act
precludes
the
granting
of
declaratory
relief.
the
state
legislative
prerogative
precludes
the
granting
of
declaratory
relief.
a
case
cited
by
my
co-counsel,
mansour
v.
green,
the
eleventh
amendment
barred
the
granting
of
declaratory
relief.
we
believe
that
is
where
the
discretion
lies.
the
courts
do
not
have
discretion
whether
or
not
to
decline
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction
is
mandatory.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
we
believe
that
the
brillhart
case,
a
decision
almost
50
years
old
at
this
point,
cannot
be
read
in
a
vacuum.
it
must
be
read
in
light
of
this
court's
intervening
decisions,
in
colorado
river,
moses
cone,
and
most
recently
in
the
nopsi
decision,
in
which
this
court
has
applied
a
different
type
of
analysis
to
cases
involving
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
they
have
not
relegated
declaratory
judgment
cases
to
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
district
judge
as
brillhart
seemed
to
do.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
colorado
river
did
not.
moses
cone
was
begun
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
arbitration
act
applied.
nopsi,
the
new
orleans
public
service
case
issued
by
this
court
in
1989,
was
expressly
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i
don't
believe
so.
in
the
first
place--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--well,
in
the
first
place
you
have
to
start
with
the
proposition
that
jurisdiction
is
unflagging,
and
you
have
to
go
from
there
into--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--well,
certainly
in
moses
cone
and
nopsi
this
court
has
reversed
abstention
decisions
in
declaratory
judgment
cases,
which...
and
the
court
has
continuously
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
the--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--i
don't
believe
that
the
fact
that
there's
a
state
action
pending
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
deny
declaratory
relief.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
because
this
court
has
continuously
emphasized
that
the
presence
of
a
parallel
action
is
no
bar
to
the
federal
court's
ruling
on
an
issue.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
well,
we
would
certainly
disagree
with
your
position
that
it's
a
valid
reason
for
declining
to
issue
the
requested
relief,
but
the
issue
is
not
whether
or
not
the
district
court...
i'm
sorry.
the
state
court
action
was
the
second
action
filed
in
this
case.
granite
state
filed
first
in
federal
court
using
an
affirmative
remedy
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
the
presence
of
a
later-filed
state
court
action
is
not
a
reason
to
decline
to
hear
a
first-filed
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
makes
no
sense,
and
it
certainly
does
not
comport
with
the
obvious
congressional
purpose
in
giving
federal
litigants
a
right
to
a
declaratory
judgment
action
when
they
have
valid
jurisdiction
to
say
that
a
litigant
who
comes
to
a
federal
court
seeking
help,
a
litigant
who
says,
i
don't
know...
i'm
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
here.
i
have
a
choice.
i
can
pay
my
assured
$10
million
on
the
one
hand
with
no
hope
of
ever
getting
it
back,
or
i
can
deny
coverage
and
get
nailed
with
a
bad
faith
lawsuit
in
state
court.
granite
state
being
faced
with
that
position
chose
what
we
believe
to
have
been
the
prudent
course
of
asking
the
federal
court
for
help.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
is
a
good
argument
for
leaving
it
in
the
state
court.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
we
would
suggest
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
represents
such
an
important
congressional
intent
that
litigants
who
have
federal
jurisdiction
be
allowed
to
retain
their
federal
jurisdiction
and
proceed
in
federal
court,
that
abstention
would
not
be
appropriate
even
in
a
later-filed
state
court
action.
the
argument
is
much
stronger
that
the
federal
court
should
defer
if
there
is
a
first-filed
state
court
action.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i
would
say
they
shouldn't
defer
even
then.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
there
was
just
a
stay
in
this
case,
but
because--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--it
has
the
same
effect
as
an
abstention
case
because
res
judicata--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--they
did
not
dismiss.
the
district
court
stayed,
but
because
of
the
presence
of
res
judicata...
because
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
any
ruling
by
the
state
court
is
going
to
effectively
keep
granite
state
out
of
its
federal
forum.
we
will
not
be
able
to
relitigate
our
issues
in
the
federal
forum.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
district
court
has
to
engage
in
abstention
analysis
before
they
can
make
a
decision
whether
to
abstain
or
not.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
not
that
he
has--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
has
done
in
this
case,
and
we
believe
that
the
district
court's
analysis
was
incorrect,
because
he
ignored
the
court's
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
the--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--it
does
not
matter
in...
certainly
not
in
the
moses
cone
analysis,
which
was
also
a
stay,
and
which
this
court
decided
resolved
under
the
colorado
river
plus
two
additional
factors.
the
moses
cone-colorado
river
analysis
involved
stays,
not
dismissal.
i
don't
recall
whether
nopsi
was
a
stay
or
a
dismissal
at
this
point,
but
the
functional
effect
of
a
stay
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
is
of
a
dismissal.
there
should
be
no
difference
in
the
analysis.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
in
the
first
instance,
we
would
prefer
to
say
that
the
legislative
policy
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
coupled
with
valid
federal
jurisdiction,
means
that
the
federal
court
cannot
dismiss
or
stay
a
case
of
this
nature.
however,
we
recognize
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
colorado
river
and
moses
cone
in
a
declaratory
judgment
case
that
there
may
be
some
certain
circumstances
in
which
there
is
an
extraordinary
state
interest
or
other
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
there
is
an
extraordinary
state
interest
or
other
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
abstention
is
appropriate,
and
we
suggest
that
those
factors
come
from
moses
cone
and
colorado
river
and
must
be
analyzed.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
well,
the
colorado
river
doctrine
states,
when
it's
coupled
with
moses
cone,
that
the
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction
is
unflagging,
and
the
factors
must
be
exercised
or
weighed
in
light
of
that
unflagging
obligation.
in
other
words,
if
the
factors
are
evenly
balanced,
or
if
the
factors
do
not
apply,
such
as
jurisdiction
over
property--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--if
the
factors--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--yes,
sir.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
but
only--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--the
obligation
only
flags
if
extraordinary
circumstances
exist,
and
the
court
has
identified
those
extraordinary
circumstances
in
the
various
abstention
doctrines...
pullman,
burford,
younger...
and
the
factors
of
colorado
river
and
moses
cone.
i
think
the
nopsi
decision,
which
was
quite
straightforwardly
a
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
lawsuit
in
which
this
court
did
not
defer
to
the
district
court's
discretion
but
instead
analyzed
it
de
novo
in
light
of
the
burford
and
younger
abstention
doctrines,
indicates
clearly
that
the
declaratory
judgment
cases
are
not
committed
to
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
district
court
but
rather
must
be
analyzed
under
traditional
principles
of
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
is
mandatory
unless
exceptional
circumstances
exist,
and
no
exceptional
circumstances
were
identified
by
the
district
court.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
yes.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
yes.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
yes.
yes,
right.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
that's
correct.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i
think
that's--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--i'm
not
sure
that
there's
no
way
to
avoid
that.
for
instance,
if
the
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
controls,
and
you
have
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
a
state,
there's
no
reason
why
that
can't
be
addressed
on
summary
judgment
immediately.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
that
issue
from
being
resolved
before
a
full-blown
trial
on
the
merits.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
it
depends
on
the
type--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--i
believe
so.
i
believe
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
do
that.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
this
case
involves
a
marine
insurance
contract
dispute.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
granite
state
claims
the
policy
is
void
ab
initio
because
tandy
misrepresented
certain
material
facts--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--in
the
formation
of
the
policy.
it's
a
fairly
simple
contract--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--no,
i'm
not
saying
he
would
have
discretion.
in
fact,
that
raises
a
point
that
i'd
like
to
address
briefly.
if
granite
state
had
filed
this
lawsuit
not
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action
but
as
a
breach
of
contract
lawsuit
seeking
to
have
the
policy
rescinded
under
traditional
contract
principles,
the
court
would
have
had
no
discretion
to
have
abstained.
the
court
would
have
had
to
have
taken
it
up,
and
granite
state
chose
to
file
this
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action
because
we
did
not
want
to
further
escalate
the
hostilities
between
the
parties.
that
judgment
call,
whether
it
be
a
declaratory
judgment
action
or
a
breach
of
contract
suit
should
not
make
the
difference
in
whether
or
not
this
case
gets
to
stay
in
federal
court.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent...
there
is
no
reason
why
equitable
relief
in
the
form
of
declaring
the
policy
void
ab
initio
should
not
be
entered
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
that's
correct,
but
we
would--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--the
court
has
to
make
the
decision
whether
the
equitable
considerations
exist
or
not,
and
the
district
court
never
got
to
that
point.
the
district
court
said,
i
don't
want
to
hear
this
court...
this
case
because
granite
state
raced
to
the
courthouse,
because
granite
state
took
advantage
of
a
proactive,
preemptive
remedy
which
is
expressly
designed
to
get
litigants
into
court
before
another
lawsuit
is
filed,
and
because
tandy
filed
a
second
lawsuit
you're
not
entitled
to
be
in
a
federal
forum.
that's
the
only
basis
for
the
district
judge's
decision.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
yes,
it
would,
and
that
is
one
of
the
ever-present
problems
in
a
dual
judicial
system.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
this
court
has
addressed
that
numerous
times.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
certainly
not,
not
unless
younger
applies,
not
unless
the,
you
know,
traditional
kind
of
equitable
considerations
with
federal
courts
enjoining
state
courts
applied.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
it
may
be
sensible
for
the
district
judge
to
have
done
that,
but
we
believe
that
congress
has
given
an
affirmative
remedy
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act
which
is
designed
to
give
litigants...
granite
state
has
never
denied
coverage
in
this
lawsuit,
yet
nonetheless
we
are
facing
a
significant,
substantial
exposure
of
$110
million
in
the
state
court
action
because
tandy
has
sued
us
for
bad
faith
failure
to
pay
them
the
$10
million
they
want.
we
believe
that
the--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--i'm
a
little
bit
confused
about
your
question,
because
i
believe
you
said
that
the
district
court
declined
to
enter
the
declaratory
relief
because
of
the
pending
state
court
action--
ms.
ann
e.

--not
because
he

decided
on
the
merits.

your
question,

ms.
ann
e.

--i
would
feel
better
in
that
situation,
although
we
would
still
be
probably
before
this
court
appealing
it.
it
results...
has
the
same
effect
on
granite
state,
the
same
adverse
effect
on
granite
state,
but
the
district
judge
has
then
engaged
in
the
correct
analysis,
which
judge
hittner
did
not
do
here.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i
believe
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
get...
give
district
court
some
guidelines
as
to
what
they're
supposed
to
in
declaratory
judgment
cases.
the
circuits
are
significantly
split
on
this
issue,
and
some
of
them
just
use
unfettered
discretion,
and
some
of
them
use
the
colorado
river-moses
cone
factors.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
yes,
brillhart
did
in
fact
construe
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
well,
brillhart--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--yes,
it
is
true.
brillhart
did--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--the
brillhart
court
stated
specifically
that
they
did
not
in
that
case
pretend
to
enumerate
all
the
factors
that
go
into
this
district
judge's
discretion.
that's
one
of
the
last
paragraphs
of
the
decision.
we
do
not
now
intend
to
enumerate
all
factors
the
district
court
should
consider
in
exercising
his
discretion.
we
believe
that
this
court's
opinions
in
later
abstention-type
cases,
specifically
colorado
river
and
moses
cone,
and
then
nopsi
put
on
top
of
that,
indicate
that
declaratory
judgment
cases
have
been
interpreted
by
this
court
to
be
the
same
type
of
case
as
any
other
case
validly
within
the
federal
jurisdiction,
and
they
must
be
viewed
with
a
light
toward
the
court's
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
in
light
of
the
moses
cone-colorado
river
factors.
that
does
not
require
overruling...
overturning
brillhart.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
fair
assessment...
or
fair
statement
that
the
intervening
decisions
of
colorado
river
and
moses
cone
and
nopsi
just
show...
just
expand
upon
the
brillhart
analysis,
but
do
not
overturn
it.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
brillhart
i
believe
reversed
an
abstention
decision
and
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court,
but
yes,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
discretion
imposed
by
moses
cone,
colorado
river
and
nopsi
is
different
from
the
one--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--i
believe
it's--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--i
believe
it's...
i
think
so.
i
mean,
there
have
been
several
declaratory
judgment
cases
this
court
has
addressed
in
recent
years,
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
has
been
decided
under
the
brillhart
analysis.
they
have...
they've
used
burford,
they've
used
pullman,
they've
used
younger,
or
they've
used
colorado
river-moses
cone.
they
have
not
used
the
brillhart
analysis.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
the
calvert
decision
is,
we
believe,
somewhat
aberrational
when
compared
with
the
others.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i...
the
calvert
decision,
i
think
that
the
plurality...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
remembering
who
was
where
in
that
case.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i
just
didn't
want
to
suggest
that
when
several
of
the
dissenters
were
present
on
the
court
today.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
the
calvert
case...
the
decisions
that
come
after
calvert
seem
to
indicate...
my
opinion
that
calvert
is
a
bit
off
the
mark
is
not
an
unusual
opinion.
the
following
decisions
say
that
moses
cone-colorado
river
are
still
good
law
and
that
brillhart
may
not
be
as
strong
a
proposition
as
my
opponents
would
have
you
believe.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
no,
sir,
we
have
not.
we
have
certainly
not
abandoned
that
issue.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
that's
because
i've
been
asked
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
abstention
doctrine.
[laughter]
the--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--it
certainly
is
a
factor
on
our
side,
and
i
believe
moses
cone--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--it
certainly
is.
moses
cone
says
that
if
there's
a
federal
law
issue...
an
issue
of
federal
law
present
then
this
court
is
virtually...
the
federal
courts
are
virtually
obligated
to
take
on
a
case,
and
we
certainly
have
not
abandoned
our
position
that
federal
maritime
law
applies
to
this
case,
and
it
applies
to
this
case
because
of
the
choice
of
law
provision
in
the
contract.
the
contract
provision
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
and
the
issue
of
choice
of
law
is
hotly
contested
by
my
opponents,
but
we
firmly
believe
that
federal
maritime
law
applies
to
the
formation
of
this
policy.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
yes,
sir.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
no,
it
does
not.
in
this
case
we
have
a
worldwide
contract
for
the
transportation...
worldwide
policy
for
the
insurance
of
goods
in--
ms.
ann
e.
webb
--our
position
is
federal
maritime
law
applies,
but
because
the
place
of
the
loss
is
korea
and
the
parties
are
diverse,
there
could
be
several
choices
of
law.
if
it's
not
federal
maritime,
it
could
as
easily
be
korean
law
as
texas
law.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
the
first
thing
i'd
like
to
comment
on
is
ms.
liberato's
pronunciation
of
utmost
good
faith.
on
our
side
of
the
bench
we
say,
uberrimae
fidei,
but
utmost
good
faith
works
just
as
well
and
it's
a
little
bit
easier
to
follow.
the
choice
of
law
provision
in
the
contract
says
specifically
all
questions
of
liability
arising
out
of
this
policy
are
to
be
governed
by
the
law
and
customs
of
england
except
in
the
united
states
and
its
possessions.
ms.
ann
e.
webb
it's
a
form
policy.
we
believe
that,
since
it
doesn't
say
whether
the
loss
arises
in
the
united
states
or
whether
the
lawsuit
arises
in
the
united
states,
it's
ambiguous
and
it
needs
to
be
construed.
we
believe
the
appropriate
construction
is
to
give
a
consistent
application
regardless
of
where
the
loss
occurs,
be
it
korea,
australia,
singapore,
texas,
seattle,
any
one
of
the
states
that
has
a
water
port.
the
only
consistent
application
is
to
apply
the
law
that
is
equivalent
to
the
law
of
england,
which
is
federal
maritime
law,
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
and
"the
insurance
regulation
belongs
to
the
state.
"
applies
here,
because
the
doctrine
of
utmost
good
faith
is
a
well-entrenched
maritime
good
doctrine,
and
it
is
not
one
of
those
cases
where
state
insurance
law
should
fill
the
cracks.
i'd
like
to
comment
briefly
about
the
district
court
never...
about
some
of
the
points
raised
by
ms.
liberato.
we're
talking
about
the
making
of
a
policy
of
insurance.
the
place
of
the
loss
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
making
of
the
policy,
and
the
policy
itself
says
the
choice
of
law
is
english,
and
we
believe
that
gets
you
to
maritime.
the
place
of
the
loss
in
korea
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
choice
of
law
that
should
apply
to
the
formation
of
the
policy.
with
regard
to
the
several
questions
about
the
standard
of
review,
abstention
doctrine
is
a
question
of
law,
which
is
customarily
reviewed
de
novo.
it
is
further
important
that
this
type
of
decision
be
reviewed
de
novo
because
of
the
comity
and
federalism
concerns
that
are
raised.
we
believe
that
both
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
keep
a
case
within
the
federal
jurisdiction
as
well
as
the
decision
on
the
merits
should
both
be
reviewed
under
a
legal
standard
de
novo.
the
district
court
partially
reviewed
the
colorado
river
factors.
he
did
not
review
the
choice
of
law
issue,
and
he
failed
to
weigh
any
of
the
issues
in
favor
of
the
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
we
further
believe
that
he
did
not
correctly
evaluate
some
of
the
ones
he
did.
for
instance,
the
minimal
inconvenience
between
houston,
texas
and
forth
worth,
texas,
when
there
were
something
upwards
of
50
flights
a
day
between
the
two
cities,
between
the
dallas-fort
worth
area
and
houston,
cannot
be
justified
in
this
modern
era.
