justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
webb,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
express...
how
you
expect
this
to
work.
after
hearing
all
the
evidence
the
district
court
says,
well,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
state
court
action
pending,
i
don't
think
it's
a
good
idea
to
issue
the
declaratory
judgment
you
want
and
therefore,
exercising
the
discretion
i
have
not
to
issue
the
declaratory
judgment,
though
i
don't
have
any
discretion
whether
to
take
all
the
evidence,
i
won't
give
you
the
declaratory
judgment.
is
that
how
it
works?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
not,
because
that
would
be
an
awful
waste
of
time
if
they
have
discretion
not
to
issue
it,
why
don't
they
have
discretion
not
to
hear
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
never
said
its
unflagging.
we've
said
it's
virtually
unflagging
and
really
haven't
even
behaved
as
though
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
must
take
the
position,
then,
that
after
taking
all
of
the
evidence
and
proceeding
with
the
trial,
the
district
court
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
deny
the
declaratory
relief,
either,
if
the
reason
he's
going
to
deny
it
she's
going
to
deny
it
that
there's
a
state
action
pending,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
a
very
good
reason
to
deny
the
declaratory
relief,
that
there's
a
prior
action
pending,
comity,
consideration
for
the
state.
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
valid
equitable
consideration?
if
it's
a
valid
consideration
for
not
issuing
the
injunction
for
the
declaratory
relief,
certainly
it's
a
valid
consideration,
it
seems
to
me,
for
not
accepting
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
to
say
it's
not
really
an
unflagging
obligation.
you
would
say
the
obligation
flags--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
lose
on
the
colorado
river
factor,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
that
call
is
different
from
the
call
as
to
whether
you
issue
the
declaratory
relief.
you
must
acknowledge
that
whether
you
will
issue
the
declaratory
judgment
is
not
governed
by
any
jurisdictional
principles--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
governed
by
equitable
principles--
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you
say
there
is
a
different
standard
for
whether
you
issue
the
injunction
than
for
whether
you
agree
to
hear
the
whole
case
in
the
first
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
we
are
confronted
with
the
problem
that
troubled
justice
kennedy
and
me
that
you're
going
to
make
judges
go
through
a
whole
trial,
even
though
it's
very
clear
that
at
the
end
of
it,
by
virtue
of
their
equitable
discretion,
they
are
not
going
to
issue
the
declaratory
judgment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
there's
no
way
to
avoid
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
not
an
equitable
issue.
you're
talking
there
a
legal
issue
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
i'm
talking
about
the
equitable
call
is
clear
at
the
outset.
the
judge
knows
that
the
court
will
not
issue
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
you
say
the
court
must
nonetheless
accept
jurisdiction
and
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
webb,
would
you
have
felt
better
if
the
district
judge
here,
after
hearing
the
same
arguments
that
it
heard
with
regard
to
the
jurisdictional
point,
had
decided
the
case
not
on
a
jurisdictional
ground,
but
rather,
on
the
merits,
and
said
after
hearing
all
this
argument
about
this
pending
state
action,
i
am
going
to
decline
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
while
this
state
act
is
pending,
and
therefore
i
dismiss
this
lawsuit
without
prejudice.
you
can
refile
it
for
declaratory
judgment
after
the
state
proceeding
is
completed.
i've
accepted
jurisdiction,
i
am
denying
you
your
declaratory
judgment
on
the
merits.
would
you
have
any
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
but
he
has
decided
on
the
merits
of
whether
equity
calls
for
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
he's
not
deciding
on
a
jurisdictional
ground.
he's
saying,
i've
accepted
jurisdiction,
i
have
on
my
hat
as
a
court
of
equity,
and
as
the
chancellor,
i
decide
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
in
which
a
declaratory
judgment
should
issue...
on
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
all
we're
fighting
about,
whether
you
want
to
conduct
the
same
argument
under
the
rubric
of
jurisdiction
or
whether
you
want
to
conduct
it
under
the
rubric
of
equitable
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
okay,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
why
we
have
federal
courts,
because
some
people
don't
trust
state
courts,
so
do
we
get
mad
when
they
come
into
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
shouldn't
it
do
it
here,
other
than
the
reason
that
there's
forum
shopping,
because
i
frankly
don't
find
that
a
very
persuasive
one.
are
there
any
other
reasons?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
dispute,
ms.
liberato,
about
what
the
standard
is
for
reviewing
a
denial
of
declaratory
relief
on
the
merits?
is
that
de
novo,
or
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
suit
has
proceeded
to
judgment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
judgment
is...
declaratory
judgment
is
denied
for
lack
of
equity.
how
is
that
reviewed?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
is
the
refusal
to
issue
an
injunction
reviewed?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
arguing
for
a
more
permissive
standard
of
review
with
regard
to
the
acceptance
of
jurisdiction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--again
as
applied
to
the
merits
question
about
whether
a
declaratory
judgment
in
equity
should
issue
or
not.
you
want
the
reviewing
court
to
review
the
declining
of
jurisdiction
more
deferentially.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know,
but
just
make
believe
it
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
you're
going
to
apply
a
more
liberal
standard
to
the
merits
than
you
apply
to
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
strange
to
me.
you
know,
that
the
judge
can
decline
to
take
the
case
entirely
and
it's
pretty
much
up
to
him,
but
if
he
takes
the
case
and
finds
no
equity
in
issuing
the
declaratory
judgment,
we're
going
to
review
that
as
an
original
matter,
just
as
though
the
question
is
for
us
and
not
for
him.
it
seems
to
me
just
backwards,
if
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
liberato,
does
everyone
say
uberrimae
fidei,
or
is
it
just
people
from
texas.
[laughter]
is
that
really
how
you
say
that?
i
mean,
everybody
says
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
seeking
information,
because
i've
read
them
but
i've
never
heard
a
live
person
say
them.
i'm
wondering
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
liberato,
why
do
you
think
that
state
law
is
going
to
be
involved
in
this
case?
why
wouldn't
english
law
govern
the
contract?
the
goods
that
were
destroyed
were
destroyed
in
south
korea,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
international
contract,
maritime
or
not.
isn't
there
a
choice
of
law
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
it
says
the
law
of
england
will
apply
except
in
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
how
it
reads,
the
law
of
england
will
apply
except
in
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
sort
of
important
as
to
whether,
you
know,
we
think
texas
law
is
really
going
to
be
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it's
not
admiralty
law,
it
may
not
be
texas
law.
i
don't
want
texas
figuring
out
english
law.
i
think
probably
the
federal
courts
are
as
good
at
that
as
the
texas
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
wind
up,
i
want
to
come
back
to
whether
review
is
de
novo
or
not.
you
concede...
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
concession
for
your
side
that
it
is
de
novo
on
review
of
injunctions,
or
at
least
declaratory
judgments
when
they're
issued
on
the
merits,
but
the
cases
that
you
rely
on
for
that,
aren't
they...
if
i
understood
your
discussion
earlier,
aren't
they
cases
in
which
declaratory
judgment
was
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
a
little
bit
different
if
you
decline
to
exercise
your
equitable
powers?
might
there
not
be
a
different
rule,
when
you
decline
to
issue
an
injunction
as
to
the
rigidity
of
the
review
as
opposed
to
when
you
issue
the
injunction,
which
raises
a
lot
of
legal
issues?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
have
a
good
deal
of
doubt
about
whether
the
ordinary
rule
for
review
is
de
novo
on
refusal
to
exercise
equitable
discretion.
it
seems
to
me
it
ought
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
repeat,
wow.
who
wrote
that,
i
wonder?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess,
if
i'm
right
about
what
the
review
of
the
failure
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
is,
a
district
judge
would
always
be
wise
to
accept
jurisdiction
and
deny
the
declaratory
judgment
instead
of
simply
saying,
i
won't
take
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
you
could
do
it
the
same
way
the
same
day,
but
you're
better--
