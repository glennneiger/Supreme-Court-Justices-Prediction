justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
just
a
stay
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
isn't
an
abstention
case
in
the
sense
that
you
dismissed
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
an
abstention
case.
it's
just
a
stay.
they
are
retaining
their
jurisdiction.
they
did
not
dismiss.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
the
colorado
river
factors
should
govern?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
colorado
river
factors
happen
to
balance
out
against
you,
why,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
proposition
was
that
let's
assume
that
the
colorado
river
factors
clearly
balance
out
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
you
would
lose
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
court
hadn't
stayed
the
action,
if
the
state
court
suit
went
ahead
and
finished
first
and
it
was
against
you,
why,
there
would
be
res
judicata,
wouldn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
sure.
sure--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
federal
court
could
stay
the
state
court
action,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
webb,
you
say
congress
has
furnished
this
remedy,
but
it
seems
to...
don't
you
think
brillhart
was
a
statutory
construction
case?
didn't
it
construe
the
declaratory
judgment
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
said
there's
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is...
i
know,
but
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
usually
don't
overturn
statutory
construction
cases
very
readily.
we
leave
it
up
to
congress.
if
they
don't
like
it,
they
change
it,
and
this
was
an
authoritative
construction
of
this
statute
that
congress
has
left
standing
all
these
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think...
you're
suggesting,
however,
i
suppose,
that
in
light
of
the
later
cases
the
degree
of
discretion
that
a
district
judge
has
in
a
declaratory
judgment
case
is
not
the
discretion
that
brillhart
suggests.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we...
you
suggest
we
have
really
revisited
our
statutory
construction
decision
in
brillhart.
justice
byron
r.
white
unknowingly,
yes.
unknowingly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
think
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
or
not.
at
least
it
may
be
a
factor
on
your
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
colorado
river
it's
a
factor
on
your
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it's
a
state
law
issue
and
no
federal
issue,
you
think
you
should
win
under
the
declaratory
judgment
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
fifth
circuit
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
theory...
and
the
theory
that
colorado
river
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
declaratory
judgment
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fifth
circuit
came
awfully
close
just
to
saying
that
there's
complete
discretion
to...
under
the...
in
the
district
court
under
the
declaratory
judgment
action
as
to
whether
to
go
ahead
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
it
refused...
the
district
court
went
through
the
colorado
river
rigmarole,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
came
out
on
your
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
even
get
to
the
colorado
river
factors.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
and
you
say
it
needn't
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
the
district
court
had
come
out
the
other
way,
and
had
applied
the
colorado
river
factors
against
you,
and
you
had
appealed,
the
court
of
appeals
probably
would
have
said,
well...
would
have
reversed,
because
the
colorado
river
factors
shouldn't
decide
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
couldn't
they
be
brought
into
the
federal
action--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
what
if
it's
a
federal
case?
what
if
it's
a
federal
law
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's...
nobody's
decided
that
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
you
make
that
point
in
your
brief,
but
your
opposition
disagrees.
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
would
think,
given
your
position
in
the
defense
of
the
fifth
circuit,
that
you
would
think
the
district
court
should
not
just
have
stayed
but
have
dismissed
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
--like
if
the
state
action
weren't
tried
within
2
years,
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
must...
where
do
you
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
have
some
clue
as
to
what
the
state
court's
docket--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what's
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--like
what?
they
must
have
statistics
in
the
state
court
system
as
to
what's
the
average
time
for
filing
a
suit...
go
ahead,
you've
got
the
answer--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
in
the
united
states
courts,
is
that
what
that
clause
means?
