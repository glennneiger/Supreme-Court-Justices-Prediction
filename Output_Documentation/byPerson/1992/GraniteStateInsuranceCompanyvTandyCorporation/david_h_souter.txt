because
four
of
the...
the
four
dissenters
in
calvert
thought
brillhart
stood
on
its
own
two
feet,
didn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
the
dissent
aberrational?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think...
my
recollection,
justice
blackmun
made
the
majority,
so
that
you
had
four,
four,
and
one,
and
the
dissenting
four,
as
i
read
the
dissent,
thought
brillhart
stood
on
its
own
feet.
you
should
say
dissent
is
always
aberrational,
ms.
webb.

justice
david
h.
souter

can
tell
who
