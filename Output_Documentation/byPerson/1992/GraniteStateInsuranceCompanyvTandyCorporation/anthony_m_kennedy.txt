justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
raised
initially.
i
don't
really
understand
what
the
rule
is
you're
proposing.
if
a
district
judge
finds,
after
looking
at
the
face
of
the
pleadings,
that
it's
most
unlikely
that
he
will
enter
this
declaratory
judgment,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
he
should
stay
the
action,
but
you
seem
to
think
that
he
has
to
proceed
through
the
motions
of
hearing
evidence
and
come
right
up
to
the
time
when
he's
ready
to
issue
his
decision.
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
call
it
abstention
analysis.
suppose
he
calls
it
declaratory
judgment
statute
analysis.
there
are
factors
that
indicate
whether
or
not
it's
prudent,
under
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
for
me
to
make
this
ruling,
for
me
to
make
this
expenditure
of
time
and
resources
of
the
courts
and
the
parties,
and
those
factors
indicate
to
me
that
i
should
not
do
this.
i'll
just
let
the
case
hang
on
the
docket
and
see
what
happens
in
the
state
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
begin
with,
he
hasn't
dismissed
the
case.
he
is
retaining
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
this
action
had
been
in
state
court...
there's
no
federal
court.
just
assume
that
granite
had
gone
first
to
a
state
court
and
asked
for
equitable
relief,
declaratory
relief,
rescission
of
the
contract,
there
had
been
a
counterclaim
for
damages.
i
think
it
would
have
been
perfectly
in
order
for
the
state
trial
judge
to
say
well,
we
have
legal
issues
here
and
equitable
issues
here,
i'm
going
to
let
the
jury
make
the
first
determination.
depending
on
what
it
does,
it
may
or
may
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
make
further
orders.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
all
likelihood
the
trial
judge
would
let
the
jury
hear
the
case
initially,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
effect
that's
all
that's
happening
here.
you
just
have
two
courts
where
the
claims
for
relief
are
divided,
rather
than
being
all
in
one,
and
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
sensible
for
the
district
court
to
say,
oh,
i'll
wait
for
the
legal
action
to
proceed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
even
the
federal
choice
of
law
issue
simply
remits
you
to
the
law
of
one
or
another
competing
states,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
position
on
the
conflict
of
law
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
if
the
insurer
alleges
that
there
was
nondisclosure
on
the
part
of
the
insured,
or
misrepresentations
in
procuring
a
policy,
does
the
state
trial
judge
have
the
choice
or
the
discretion
to
hear
the
equitable
claims
for
rescission
first
before
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
trial
judge
in
texas
often
exercise
the
discretion
that
way,
or
does
he
usually
submit
all
the
issues
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
why
it
doesn't
simplify
it
in
one
respect,
leaving
aside
for
a
moment
the
using
resources
of
multiple
courts,
if
there's
no
coverage,
then
that's
the
end
of
it,
there's
no
jury
trial.
that's
a
substantial
saving
for
the
insurer,
isn't
it?
