ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
an
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
declaratory
relief
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
the
purpose
of
a
declaratory
judgment
is
to
settle
and
to
clarify
legal
issues.
it
is
to
provide
relief
from
uncertainty
and
from
insecurity.
but
here,
what
granite
state
is
trying
to
do
is
to
turn
these
wholesome
purposes
of
declaratory
judgment
relief
on
its
head,
and
instead
of
simplifying
the
issues,
declaratory
relief
in
this
case
would
complicate.
instead
of
clarify,
it
would
confuse.
to
have
a
declaratory
judgment
action
take
place
in
this
case
would
increase
costs,
and
it
would
waste
judicial
resources
and
personal
resources
and
the
resources
of
the
parties.
this
is
an
attempt
to
forum-shop
by
granite
state.
it
is
a
tactical
attempt
to,
if
you
will,
divide
and
conquer,
and
to
seek
safe
harbor,
to
use
an
admiralty
term,
but
to
seek
safe
harbor
in
the
federal
courts.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
it's
okay--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--we
don't,
but
there
are
times
when
it's
appropriate
to
consider
that
and
times
when
it's
not,
and
in
this
particular
case
it's
a
misuse
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action
to
seek
that
safe
harbor.
certainly
it's
not
inappropriate
to
seek
it
under
the
right
circumstances.
this
just
isn't
one
of
those
circumstances,
because
the
declaratory
judgment
relief
is
discretionary,
and
we
know
it's
discretionary
because
it's
specifically
provided
for
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
where
congress
says
that
any
court
of
the
united
states
may
declare
rights
and
other
legal
relationships.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
has
to...
that
it
may
declare
rights,
and
so
whenever--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--well,
there
are
many
reasons,
and...
for
example,
the
danger
of
piecemeal
litigation,
the
application
of
state
law
rather
than
federal
law,
all
of
these
types
of
factors
that
you
hear
frequently
discussed
in
cases
using
moses
cone
and
using
colorado
river,
and
even
using
abstention,
those
kinds
of
analysis
also
apply
to
the
determination
of
whether
there
should
be
declaratory
relief
granted,
at
least
the
declaratory
judgment
heard.
but
it's
also
easy
to
kind
of
mix
up
apples
and
oranges,
because
even
though
those
common
sense
factors
go
into
the
determination
of
whether
it's
appropriate--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--i
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
to
say--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--the
record
doesn't
tell
us
that.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
but
in
this
particular
case
what
is
in
the
record
is
the
fact
that
there
was
practically
no
progress
in
the
federal
court
action.
the
only
thing--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--the
state
court
suit?
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
was
about...
i
think
it
was
21
days
after
the
federal
suit
was
filed.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
think
it
depends
on
the
progress
that
was
made
in
the
state
action...
excuse
me,
the
progress
that
had
taken
place
in
the
federal
action.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
think
it
depends
on
the
other
factors
that
are
present
in
the
case.
i'm
not
sure--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--well--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--bring
in
other
parties,
right.
the
danger
of
piecemeal
litigation
certainly
is
here,
but
that's
present
any
time
there's
parallel
cases.
the
forum
shopping
aspect--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--it
has
relevance.
i
think
that
is
a
factor
to
a
degree.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
it
should
consider
it
just
because
that
is
yet
another
practical
factor.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
in
particular,
the
district
judge
talked
about
three
factors.
he
elaborated
actually
on
all
those
other
factors
as
an
alternative
to
his
primary
decision,
which
is
that
under
brillhart
it
was
discretionary.
there
he
talked
about
the
piecemeal
adjudication,
forum
shopping,
and
needless
decision
state
law.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--that
is
true,
but
as
the...
as
the,
really
the
putative
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
the
claimant.
looking
at
the
claim
and
not
the
claimant
we
have
a
right,
i
believe,
to
pick
our
forum,
and
in
certain
instances
certainly
the
federal
plaintiff
in
this
case,
granite
state,
has
the
right
to
pick
its
forum,
but
then
once
it
picks
its
forum,
then
the
district
judge
has
the
discretion
under
brillhart
to
determine
whether
that
and
balancing
all
the
other
factors
that
are
appropriate
in
making
that
determination
whether
the
state
or
the
federal...
well,
not
really
the
state
is
appropriate,
but
whether
the
federal
forum
is
appropriate
and
whether
that
federal
action
should
go
forward.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
think
that
it
does
not,
except
for
the
fact
that
some
of
the
factors
that
go
into
the
colorado
river
analysis
just
logically
go
into
a
determination
of
whether
a
district
judge
properly
exercises
his
or
her
discretion.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
don't
think
it's
complete
discretion.
i
think
that
they
were
saying
that
the
district
court
has
a
lot
of
discretion
and
that
that
discretion
is
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
yes,
your
honor,
it
did
as
an
alternative--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
right.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
say
it
needn't
have,
except
to
the
limited
degree
that
those
are
logical
factors
for
a
trial
court
to
consider
in
exercising
its
discretion.
the
principles
underlying
the
unflagging
obligation
of
the
court
to
consider
a
case
are
different,
because
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
a
declaratory
judgment
action
is
discretionary,
and
there's
a
specific
legislative
mandate
that
makes
that
discretionary,
and
that's
why
it's
different,
that
the
whole
difference
in
this
case
is
the
fact
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
if
it
were
not,
we
wouldn't
disagree
that
the
court
has
an
unflagging
duty
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
and
congress
has
said
that
that
is
discretionary,
as
has
this
court
in
brillhart.
and
so
if
i
may
come
back
to
your
question,
justice
white,
only
to
say
that
yes,
the
factors
apply
in
the
sense
of
making
a
common
sense
determination,
but
as
far
as
using
the
standard,
the
unflagging
obligation
standard
in
applying
those
factors,
that
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
i
agree
to
the
point
that
i
think
that
if
the
district
court
had
agreed
to
hear
this
case
and
granted
declaratory
relief,
that
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
reversed,
because
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
policy
to
say
that
the
presumption
is
against
the
district
court
exercising
its
declaratory
judgment
relief
authority
if
there
is
a
parallel
state
court
action,
and
so
i
do
believe--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--only
after
final
disposition
of
the
case.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
there
are...
they
could
have
granted,
i
guess,
arguably,
a
summary
judgment.
i
think
it's
possible
that
that
could
arise.
there
are
some
cases
that
have
come
through
the
circuits
where
the
court
has
actually
reversed
the
case
based
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
hearing
the
case
after
the
district
court
granted
the
declaratory
judgment
relief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
those
cases
you'll
find
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
because
they
use
that
in
support
of
their
contention
that
de
novo
is
a
proper
standard
of
review,
and
perhaps
i
could
address
that
for
just
a
moment.
it
seems
logical,
and
perhaps
going
back
to
what
justice
white
was
talking
about,
about
the
fifth
circuit's
view
of
this,
and
just
a
great
deal
of
discretion,
but
it
seems
logical
that
if
there
is
discretion
to
grant
declaratory
relief,
or
to
hear
a
declaratory
judgment
case,
then
that
should
be
reviewed
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
but
just
in
looking
at
the
cases
as
they
reach
the
circuits
and
they
apply
a
de
novo
review,
they
apply
that
review
to
cases
where
the
court
did
indeed
hear
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
then
the
circuits
reverse
on
a
de
novo
review
of
the
granting
of
the
declaratory
relief,
and
i
think
that's
significant.
i
think
it
supports
our
position,
because
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
case
in
which...
and
this
type
of
case
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
should
not
have
granted
and
should
at
least
properly
exercise
its
discretion
and
refuse
to
hear
the
declaratory
judgment
relief
request.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
it
is...
i--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--right.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
more
often
than
not,
it's
reviewed
de
novo.
i
don't
know
of
a
pronouncement
from
this
court,
but
it
appears
to
me
in
reading
the
cases
from
the
different
circuits
that
there
is
a
variance,
but
more
often
than
not
they
use
a
de
novo
review.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
don't
know.
i
believe
it's
abuse
of
discretion,
but
i'm
not
sure,
on
injunction.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
i--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--in...
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
in
this
case
it
doesn't
matter
either
way.
i
know
that
the
court--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--okay.
of
course,
i
would
prefer
that
it
be
abuse
of
discretion,
because
that's
a
more
liberal
standard,
and
that
would
be
more
favorable.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--well,
part
of
it
may
well
be
that
in
applying
the
factors
it
may
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
i
understand,
of
course,
that
de
novo
review
is
very
different
than
abuse
of
discretion,
but
in
looking
at
the
factors,
the
common
sense
factors
that
results
tend
to
be
the
same
in
most
of
the
cases
that
use
de
novo
review
whether
it's
on
the
front
end
or
the
back
end.
after
the
determination
on
the
merits
the
result
comes
out
to
be
the
same,
and
that
is
a
great
deference
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
think
the
trial
court
would
have
that
discretion
to
do
that.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
he
submits
all
of
the
factual
issues,
certainly,
to
the
jury,
and
i
would
say
tends
to
submit
the
issues
to
the
jury.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
jury
trial
the
judges
tend
to
submit
the
whole
case
to
the
jury,
but
all
of
those
kinds
of
questions
still
have
to
be,
i
think,
couched
in
terms
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
is
to
simplify,
it
is
not
to
complicate,
and
in
this
case--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--if
it
were
a
mirror
image
case,
that
may
be
true,
but
it's
not
a
mirror
image
because
there
are
in
the
state
court
six
other
parties
that
are
not
present
and
can't
be
brought
into
the
federal
action,
and
so
all
it
will
do
instead
is
confuse
the
issues,
not
simplify
them.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
they
couldn't
be
brought
in
because
it
would
destroy
diversity
to
bring
them
in.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
if
it
were
a
federal
case,
then
that
would
be
true,
they
could
be
brought
in,
but
this
is
not
a
federal
question
case.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
if
they
were
to
decide
that,
i
would
make
a
strong
argument
that
uberrimae
fidei
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
that
is
the
only
federal
issue
that
granite
state
has
injected
into
this
case.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
we
disagree
on
several
things.
[laughter]
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
but
this
is
one
we--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--yes,
your
honor,
but
this
is
one
i
think
we
disagree
on
even
more
than
others.
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why
uberrimae
fidei
doesn't
change
the
ability
of
the
judge
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
the
way
that
he
did.
the
first
is,
this
is
not
an
admiralty
case.
this
case
involves
a
warehouse
endorsement
to
an
open...
marine
open,
cargo
marine
policy.
it
is
the
endorsement.
it
covers...
and
this
is
what...
the
only
damage
was...
that
we're
seeking
to
be
paid
for
damage
that
occurred
in
an
inland
plant
and
damage
to
inventory
and
work
in
progress.
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
anything
even
remotely
wet,
or
as
this
court
put
in
one
case,
it
does
not
have
a
salty
flavor,
but
even
if
it
did--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--judge
scalia,
it's
only
italians
from
texas
that
say
it
that
way.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
sorry.
however
you
say
those
two
words--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--well,
at
the
fifth
circuit
judge
jones
was
kind
enough
to
say
it
first
before
i
had
to,
and
frankly,
i
parroted
the
way
she
said
it,
and
she
is
from
texas
also,
so
at
least
from
that
sample...
i
guess
i
have
to
confess,
i
cannot
answer
your
question.
the
best
i
know,
it's
uberrimae
fidei.
but
the
other
part
of
it,
even
assuming,
to
go
back
to
the
issue
that
judge
white
raises
about...
justice
white,
about
whether
there
is
a
federal
question
here
based
on
uberrimae
fidei,
even
if
you
assume
that
there
were...
was,
it
is
a
defense
only.
it
wouldn't
even
be
enough
in
this
particular
case
to
raise
federal
question
jurisdiction
if
they
were
properly
a
plaintiff.
of
course,
in
a
declaratory
judgment
act
again
you
look
at
the
claim
and
not
the
claimant,
and
so
that
is
why,
even
if
it
did
apply,
which
we
vehemently
disagree
that
it
does
not,
we
do
not
believe
that
would
make
any
difference.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
i
think
that
the
stay
is
fine.
i
don't...
we
don't
have
any
dispute
with
the
stay.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
because...
because...
if...
there
may
be
some
circumstance
that
would
come
up
that
would
be
proper
for
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
lift
the
stay.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
think
that's
an
excellent
point,
and
certainly
that
would
be
a
reason,
and
it
didn't
cut
off
granite
state
from
any
right
to
appeal,
obviously.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
in
houston.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
oh,
i
do
know
what
the
state
court's
docket
is
like.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
in
this
particular
case
we'd
be
pretty
far
down
the
road
in
this
particular
court.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
my
co-counsel
can
be
real
specific
and
say
that
it's
18
months.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
18
months
to
get
to
trial.
this
is
a
little
bit
more
complicated
case
because
it
does
have
so
many
parties,
but
18
months
is
about
right
in
the
southern
district--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--they're
getting
to
trial
faster,
frankly,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
how
quickly
they
are
getting
to
trial,
but
i
do
know
that
they're
getting
to
trial
much
faster
now
than
they
used
to,
but
the
court--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
don't
know
specifically.
i
frankly
don't
know.
i
do
know,
of
course,
that
under
the
federal
justice
reform
act
that
there
are
many
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
southern
district
and
that,
because
of
those
changes,
that
one
is
able
to
get
a
civil
case
before
the
federal
court
much
more
quickly,
but
it's
still
a
long
time.
as
a
general
rule...
yes,
your
honor?
well,
as
you
say,
as
a
general
rule
it
is
easier,
much
easier
to
get
to
trial
in
state
court
and
to
get
to
trial
more
quickly
in
state
court
than
it
is
in
federal
court.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
right.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
there
is
a
choice
of
law,
and
it
says
that
i
believe
the
laws
of
england
will
apply
except
in
the
united
states,
but
all
of
the
contract
formation
took
place
in
the
united
states.
these
are
all
american
companies
involved,
all
of
the
defendants
are,
many
of
the
parties
are
from
texas,
in
fact.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
except
in
the
united
states.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i'm
not
sure
precisely,
but
it's
close
to
that.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
and
so--
[laughter]
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
i
can't
remember
exactly,
but
it--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--well--
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
--well,
but
all
of
the
dispute
here
goes
to
the
contract
formation
and
all
of
the
action
that
took
place
that
relates
to
this
determination
definitely
occurred
in
texas.
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
argued
that
english
law
applies
other
than
uberrimae
fidei.
i'm
sure
ms.
webb
will
correct
me
on
that
if
i'm
wrong,
but
by
and
large
the
controversy
is
going
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
and
insurance
law,
which
necessarily...
or,
not
necessarily,
but
which
have
actually
been
left
specifically
by
congress
through
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
to
the
states.
this
is
peculiarly
an
issue
of
state
court
interest,
because
that's
what
is
being
construed,
is
a
provision
in
the
contract,
and
the
resulting
bad
faith
claims
that
we
have,
breach
of
contract,
all
of
those
are
peculiar
to
the
state
and
state
court
law,
and
that
is
another
factor,
i
believe,
that
the
court
decides
in
exercising
its
discretion
to
grant
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
there
are
many
factors
the
court
can
apply.
the
fifth
circuit
emphasized
forum
shopping
and
inconvenience.
judge
hittner
in
the
district
court
emphasized
the
piecemeal
litigation
aspect,
the
forum
shopping
aspect,
and
needless
decisions
of
state
law.
it
would
be
possible,
and
certainly
judge
hittner
did
that
to
a
degree
in
analyzing
the
moses
cone
and
colorado
river
factors,
to
look
at
other
things,
like
the
order
in
which
jurisdiction
was
acquired
and
some
of
the
other
factors
that
are
found
in
other
cases,
but
the
point
is
that
if,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
the
court
doesn't
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
that
relief,
to
provide
relief
to
simplify
and
to
clarify
issues,
then
that
declaratory
judgment
is
not
appropriate,
and
for
these
reasons...
yes.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
it
seems
to
be
that
in
fact
that's
a
distinction
that
the
circuit
courts
have
made
not
specifically
but
in
fact.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
well,
i
agree
with
you,
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
this
case,
but
my
point,
which
i
did
not
make
very
artfully,
that
in
either
event,
that
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
the
court
exercising
its
jurisdiction,
so
i
would
believe
that
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
was
correct
and
that
the
district
court
was
proper
in
issuing
the
stay.
ms.
lynne
a.
liberato
in
terms
of
getting
reversed,
i
guess
that's
correct,
but
we
believe
that
unless
the
traditional
concerns
precluding
a
declaratory
judgment
exist,
the
district
court
should
maintain
jurisdiction.
thank
you,
your
honor.
