david
h.
souter
but
you
would
simply
win
if
we
sort
of
followed
a
rule
that
when
the
ambiguity
is
created
as
between
punctuation
and
verbal
text,
the
verbal
text
controls?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
you
need?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
another
way
of
dealing
with
it,
though,
simply
to
say
don't
go
behind
the
enrolled
bill,
but
make
a
choice
between
the
two
signals
in
the
enrolled
bill,
and
the
verbal
signal
is
the
one
that
controls
over
the
punctuational
signal?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
makes
perfect
sense
if
the
provision
in
which
this
act
appears
is
the
provision
which
expressly
speaks
of
an
amendment
taking
place.
but
it
doesn't
make
sense
if
this
act
occurs
in
the
text
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
result
of
the
amendment,
or
the
result
of
the
reenactment.
and
we're
in...
we're
in
the
second
situation
here,
aren't
we,
or
at
least
arguably
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
debt
to
capital?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
what
5202
is
dealing
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
that
simply
prove
that
what
the
case
turns
on
is
not
what
the
1918
act
provided,
but
what
the
1916
act
provided?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
92
appear
somewhere
else
in
that
compilation,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
assuming
that
the
comptroller's
own
compilation
was
therefore
ambiguous,
would
it
be
a
fair
maybe
speculation
is
the
word...
that
on
that
assumption
that
one
purpose
of
the
1918
amendment
to
5202
was
in
fact
to
clear
up
that
ambiguity,
and
make
it
clear
that
section
92
was
in
the
federal
reserve
act
and
not
in
5202?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
if
you
assume
there's
an
ambiguity
created
by
the
comptroller's
own
compilation
merely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
section
92
appears
in
two
places,
might...
well,
let's
just
stipulate
that
we
could
describe
that
as
an
ambiguity...
might
that
be
a
purpose...
have
been
a
purpose
of
the
18
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
wouldn't
it
have
cleared
it
up
by
making
it
clear
that
section
92
was
not
part
of
5202?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you're
saying
the
only
way
they
could
have
done
that
would
have
been
unambiguously
to
take
52
out...
5202
out
of
the
federal
reserve
act
completely?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we...
mr.
wright,
just
a
technical
question.
i
just
can't
remember
this
from
the
briefs.
is
there
a
citation
to
this
or
a
title
to
this
book?
