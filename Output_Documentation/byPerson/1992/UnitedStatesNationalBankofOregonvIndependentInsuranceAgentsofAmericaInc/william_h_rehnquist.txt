chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
92-484,
united
states
national
bank
of
oregon
v.
the
independent
insurance
agents
of
america,
and
a
companion
case.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
everything
in
this
section
was...
now
you're
referring
to
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
bracketed
numbers
in
the
margins
on
page
60
and
69
were
added
by
the
parties
to
this...
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
so
far
as
the
quotation
marks
argument
is
concerned,
the
enrolled
bill
had
them.
and
we
don't
go
behind
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
i'm
a
little
bit
surprised
that
you
would
rest
your
argument
at
all
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
our...
any
of
our
previous
cases
dealing
with
the
enrolled
bill
doctrine
indicated
that
an
ambiguity
is
sufficient
to
go
behind
the
enrolled
bill?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wright.
ms.
kappler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
place
that
we
can
follow
you,
ms.
kappler?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
7
in
the
margin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
section
5202
deal
with
before
it
was
amended
in
1913?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
there
any
committee
reports
at
all
indicate
what
would
be
today
a
section-by-section
analysis
of
the
1916
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
town
of
ottawa
case
was
talking
about
something
done
by
the
illinois
legislature,
and
this
court
was
really
just
upholding
the
ruling
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
that
case.
i
don't
regard
that
as
quite
the
same
as
if
the
case
had
been
discussing
an
act
of
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
a
rather
strange
doctrine
if
this
court
accept
only
the
arguments
of
one
side
or
the
arguments
of
the
other,
and
couldn't
possibly
think
the
thing
through
for
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
kappler.
mr.
wright,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
the
case
is
submitted.
