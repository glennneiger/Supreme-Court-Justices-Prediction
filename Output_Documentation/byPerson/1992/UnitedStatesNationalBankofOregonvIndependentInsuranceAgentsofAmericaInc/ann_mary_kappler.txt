ms.

mary

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
assert
that
law
exists
which
permits
national
banks
to
sell
insurance
in
small
towns.
now,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
that
law
cannot
be
found
in
the
u.s.
code,
in
the
current
version
of
the
u.s.
code.
that
creates
a
statutory
presumption
that
no
such
law
is
in
force.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
they
have
any
bearing,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor.
the
statutory
provision
expressly
states
that
it's
the
current
version
of
the
code
that
creates
prima
facie
evidence
of
what
law
is
in
force
today.
therefore,
congress
wants
litigants
to
look
at
today's
code,
not
at
the
1950
version
of
the
code,
not
at
the
1926
version
of
the
code.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
it
worked
a
change
in
the
presumption,
your
honor,
not
a
change
in
the
law,
whether
it
existed
or
not.
but,
yes,
it
changed
the
presumption.
when
the
law
was
on
the
books
in
the
u.s.
code,
the
presumption
was
that
it
was
in
force.
once
it
was
omitted,
and
it
has
been
omitted
for
the
last
40
years,
it
is
not
the
presumption
that
it
is
not
in
force.
in
either
way--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
your
honor.
in
either
way,
we
can
see
that...
that
it
can't
be
contradicted
by
the
statutes
at
large.
but
petitioners
are
here
trying
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
the
statutes
at
large
actually
present
a
law
that
is
in
force
that
permits
national
banks
to
sell
insurance.
now,
that
provision
appears
once
in
the
statutes
at
large.
and
that's
in
1916.
on
its
face,
the
enrolled
bill,
which
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
statutes
at
large,
of
that
1916
act
places
section
92
in
revised
statutes
5202.
and
it
does
both
with
language
and
with
punctuation.
it
begins
by
stating:
revised
statutes
5202
are
hereby
amended
to
read
as
follows.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
certainly,
your
honor.
using,
again,
the
bank
petitioner's
cert
petition
at
page
70a,
in
the
appendix
of
that.
and
this
is
the
paragraph
that
is
noted
as
bracketed
number
7.
it
begins
by
stating:
"section
5202
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
united
states
is
hereby
amended
so
as
to
read
as
follows.
"
it
then
sets
out
the
series
of
paragraphs.
and
it
includes
those
paragraphs
within
bracket
and
quotation
marks.
now,
as
this
court
held
in
nashville
milk,
the
only
way
to
interpret
those
words
and
those
quotation
marks
is
as
amending
a
statute
and
as
setting
out
in
haec
verbia
the
new
amended
version
of
5202.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
correct...
no,
your
honor,
it
does
make
sense.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
how
laws
were
made.
at
the
time,
there
was
no
code.
what...
what
we
had...
if
you
wanted
to
figure
out
what
the
law
was
in
1916,
you
went
first
to
the
revised
statutes.
that
was
a
compilation
of
all
the
laws
that
had
been
passed
up
through
1873.
it
was
essentially
a
code.
from
there
on,
however,
you
had
to
work
your
way
chronologically
through
the
revised
statutes.
so,
if
someone
wanted
to
know
what
5202
of
the
revised
statutes
was
in
1916,
they
have
to
begin
with
the
revised
statutes
and
work
their
way
through.
now
when
the
reach
the
text
of
the
1916
act,
they
would
read...
read
through,
and
the
text
would
say...
they
would
come
to
a
reference
of
1916
act.
that
is
that
5202
is
not
moving
anyplace.
the
only
place
anyone
is
going
to
read
it
is
right
there
in
the
text
of
the
1916
act.
this
act
was
in
fact
used
by
congress
at
the
time
as
a
reference
to
the
very
act
that
was
enacting
the
words.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor.
i
think
exactly
how
someone
would
understand
this...
well,
first
of
all,
there
are
two
ways
someone
would...
and
we
absolutely
agree,
this
act
refers
to
the
federal
reserve
act,
as
amended,
as
first
passed
in
1913,
and
then
as
amended
in
1916.
and
there
are
two
ways
anyone
who
read
this
would
understand
that.
first
of
all,
it
could
only
refer
to
the
federal
reserve--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--now
i'm
referring
to
paragraph...
what
is
bracketed
number
8.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
it's
the
paragraph
that
follows
afterwards
on
page
70a.
and
it's
this...
the
use
of
the
phrase,
"this
act",
on
which
the
petitioners
hinge
their
entire
textual
argument.
if
someone
is
reading
this,
they're
only
going
to
read
it
in
the
context
of
the
1916
act.
it's
going
to
make
reference
to
1916
act.
they're
not
going
to
read
it
anywhere
else,
because
that's
the
way
in
which
laws
were
made.
that's
why
it's
not
insignificant
that
when
a
code
was
finally
created,
the
codifiers
replaced
the
phrase,
"this
act",
every
time
they
saw
it,
and
replaced
it
with
a
reference
to
whatever
the
particular
statute
was
in
which
the
phrase
appeared.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
well,
i
will
agree,
your
honor,
that
the...
that
congress
was
not
stylistically
consistent.
whether
they
did
that
for
absolute
clarity
or
not,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
but
i
will
agree
they
were
not
consistent.
but
there's
no
ambiguity
in
understanding
what
"this
act"
meant.
and
even
when
you
look...
even
if
there
was--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--well,
your
honor,
the
problem,
though,
is
that
this
piece
of
statute
that's
being
amended
did
two
things.
the
1913
act,
when
it
was
amended,
did
two
things.
it
created
new
law,
creating
the
federal
reserve
system,
and
it
amended
not
just
5202,
but
10
different
sections
of
the
revised
statutes.
so
to
simply
refer
to
the
federal
reserve
act
is
to
refer
both
to
the
newly
enacted
law,
the
federal
reserve
system,
and
the
amendments
it
made
to
preexisting
law.
that's
why
petitioners
arguing
about
the
title
is
an
entire
red
herring.
i
mean,
of
course,
congress
could
say
we
are
enacting...
this
is
an
act
to
amend
certain
sections
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
but
the
federal
reserve
act
included
within
it
amendments
to
revise
statutes
5202.
so
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
to
repeat
that.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
section
5202
is
derived...
its
origin
is
a
section
of
the
national
bank
act.
and
it
specifically
dealt
with
limitations
on
indebtedness
that
national
banks
could
incur.
and
it's
our
proposition,
your
honor,
that
that's
why
in
fact
congress
could
sensibly
place
section
92
in
the
revised
statutes
5202.
the
comptroller,
who
is
the
one
who
suggested
that
section
92,
this
permission
for
banks
to
sell
insurance,
be
enacted,
specifically
proposed
it
to
be
an
amendment
to
the
national
bank
act.
now--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
it
has
a
relationship
to
debt
to
capital.
but
what
congress--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--but
5202,
your
honor,
is
part
of
the
national
bank
act.
the
provisions
which
the
petitioners
want
you
to
insert
it...
to
group
it
together
with
are
provisions
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
powers
of
national
banks.
they
want
you
to
group
it
together
with
language
that
has
to
do
with
the
banking
powers
of
federal
reserve
banks.
this
had
to
do
with
the
non-banking
powers
of
just
national
banks,
not
federal
reserve
banks
at
all.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
when
congress
enacted
this
law,
section
92,
it
evidently
didn't
want
to
just
write
a
new
law...
propose
a
separate
bill,
but
wanted
to
propose
it
as
an
amendment
to
a
bill
that
was
already
in
front
of
it.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
nor
does
section
10.
and
that's
why
it
is
folly
for
this
court
to
try
to
entertain
questions
of
where
should
these
paragraphs
go,
cutting
and
pasting
where
they're
connected
with,
and
should
follow
the
signals
that
congress
provided
in
the
enrolled
bill.
that
is,
the
opening
and
closing
quotation
marks.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
neither
our
interpretation
of
the
statute,
which
would
group
all
three
of
these
paragraphs
in
5202
as
the
quotation
marks
exactly
show...
and
there's
no
other
way
to
read
them...
that
is
not
particularly
sensible
with
those
two
paragraphs
surrounding
92.
but
neither
is
petitioners'
argument.
and
you'll
notice
in
their
half
an
hour
of
argument,
they
made
absolutely
no
attempt
to
justify
why
congress
would
have
put
a
provision
allowing
national
banks
to
sell
insurance
together
with
the
rest
of
this
federal
reserve
act.
if
the
court
is
going
to
engage
in
cutting
and
pasting,
then
section
92
should
logically
be
fitted
with
section
5202,
and
those
other
two
paragraphs
should
be
fitted
with
the
rest
of
the
text.
but
this
court
is
not
about
making
sensible
law
or
law
that
makes
sense...
that
reads
smoothly.
what
this
court
has
to
do
is
give
effect
to
the
text
that's
on
the
page.
and
on
the
page
here
we
have
opening
and
closing
quotation
marks
that
cannot
be
read
any
other
way.
now,
the
petitioners,
although
they
pose
this
as
a
way
of
sort
of
statutory
construction,
in
fact,
they
are
asking
this
court
to
erase,
to
ignore
the
quotation
marks.
and
the
reason
they're
doing
that
is
because
there's
no
other
way
to
read
those
quotation
marks,
except
but
enclosing
what
is
revised
statutes
5202.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
paragraph
9
you
mean,
your
honor,
the
one
that--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--no,
there
are
other
provisions
which...
which
relate
to
national
banks.
however,
they
relate
to
national
banks
as
they
are
functioning
within
the
federal
reserve
system.
both
state
banks
and
national
banks
could
become
part
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
so
that,
in
other
places
where
there
is
mention
of
national
banks,
it's
in
connection
with
their
interaction,
either
with
the
federal
reserve
board
or
with
federal
reserve
banks.
this
is
the
only
section
that
talks
specifically
about
simple
stand-alone
powers
of
national
banks.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
your
honor,
the
preexisting
national
bank
act,
which
was
codified
as
such
in
different
sections
of
the
revised
statutes,
did
just
that.
it
created
national
banks
and
gave
them
specific
powers.
they
are
only
creatures
of
statute.
i...
as
to
a
specific
question
of
what
happened
afterwards--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
do
not
know
whether
the...
i
know
that
the
national
bank
act
was...
sections
of
the
national
bank
act
were
subsequently
amended
without
amending
the
federal
reserve
act.
but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
specific
question,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
and
they
are
deemed
repealed
with
the
exact
same
explanation
that
is
given
as
to
section
92.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
well,
as
mr.
wright
has
conceded,
a
subsequent
congress
cannot
amend
a
nonexistent
statute.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress,
in
1982,
apparently
assumed
that
section
92
was
still
in
existence.
and
it
sought,
purported,
to
strike
out
a
provision
of
that
law.
but
as
this
court
explained
as
long
ago,
in
town
of
south
ottawa,
congress
can't
because
it
presumes
a
law
is
in
effect...
and
effectively
reenact
it.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
we
don't
concede
that
it's
possible
to
read
the
1916
act
any
other
way.
but,
second,
there's
no
evidence
here
that
congress,
in
1982,
or
again,
later
on,
when
it
sought
to
impose
a
moratorium,
focused
at
all
on
the
issue
of
whether
section
92
is
in
existence
or
not.
the
one
time
in
which...
well,
two
times...
in
which
congress
actually
focused
on
that
issue
were
in
1958,
when
there
was
a
lot
of
dispute
as
to
whether
section
92
was
in
existence
or
not,
and
evidence
was
submitted
on
both
sides.
and
congress
specifically
said
they
couldn't
resolve
the
issue.
now,
justice
white,
you
asked
the
question,
why
didn't
the
comptroller
ask
to
have
the
law
reenacted.
in
fact,
the
federal
reserve
board
specifically
wrote
to
the
house
judiciary
committee,
and
it's
the
house
judiciary
committee
that's
in
charge
of
writing
the
code,
stating
that
they
thought
the
omission
was
wrong;
that
section
92
should
be
put
back
in;
you've
made
a
wrong
judgment.
in
1958,
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
testified,
no,
we
think
we're
exactly
right.
it
was...
it
was
omitted
purposefully.
we
made
a
conscious
decision.
that's
why
it's
not
there.
this...
the
person
who
said
they
made
the
conscious
decision
was
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
who
testified
during
the
hearings
in
1958.
it's
the
house
judiciary
committee
that's
charged
by
congress
with
creating
the
code.
again,
in
1965--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--it
was
his
testimony,
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
accompanied
by
the
law...
the
law
revision
counsel,
who
is
the
person
appointed
by
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
be
in
charge
with
the
revisions.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
because
i
think
the
statutes--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--correct,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
statutes
at
large
are
clear.
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
it
was
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
coffee.
and
we
do
cite
him
in
our
brief.
i
want
to
say
it's
coffee,
but
i
may
be
incorrect
at
the
time.
in
terms
of
what
congress
then...
congress
did
in
enacting,
and
the
only
way
in
which
congress
can
revive
section
92
is
by
going
through
the
bicameral
motions
under
the
constitution,
presenting
it
to
the
president,
and
having
it
signed
into
law.
no
congress
has
done
that
here.
and
if
we're
asking
the
question:
what
did
the
post-1918
congresses
think,
one
way
or
another?
they
were
of
mixed
views.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
no
matter
what
these
later
congresses
thought,
unless
they
reenacted
the
law,
they
could
not
in
any
way
revive
the
law.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor,
not
the
way
the
petitioners
ask
you
to
do.
the
case--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
legislative
history
would
get
you
nowhere
here.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
there
was
no
discussion
at
any
point
in
time
about
where
this
paragraph
should
be
placed.
that
is,
whether
it
should
be
placed
in
5202
or
elsewhere.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
well,
your
honor,
what
the
1918
congress
thought
it
was
doing
is
not
relevant
to
what
the
1916
congress
did
in
enacting
the
law
in
1916.
now,
in
terms
of
what
the
1918
congress
did,
of
course,
the
best
evidence
of
its
purpose
is
the
text
of
the
1918
act,
which
restated
5202
without
section
92.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
correct,
your
honor.
and
even
if--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
ultimately,
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
correct.
of
course,
what
this
court
is
going
to
be
giving
effect
to
is
what
the
1918
congress
did,
in
light
of
the
1916
act.
but
the
question
does,
we
would
agree,
turn
on
whether
section
92
is
part
of
5202
or
not
part
of
5202.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor...
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
i...
i
do
know,
in
reading
through
the
descriptions
of
the
act,
there
is
nothing
that
describes
either
the...
the
section
92.
that
is,
the
paragraph
that
allows
them
to
sell
insurance,
nor
section
13,
that
would
give
you
one
clue...
one,
either
way
or
another.
there
is
simply
no
discussion
at
all,
frankly,
of
this
new
provision
to
allow
banks
to
sell
insurance.
it
was
introduced
as
an
amendment
on
the
floor
in
the
senate
after
committee,
and
then
there
was
no
discussion.
if
there's
any
indication
as
to
where
it
should
go,
it
is
the
comptroller's
suggestion
that
it
may
be
part
of
the
national
bank
act,
and
revised
statutes
5202
is
the
only
provision
in
the
1916
act
that
comes
from
the
national
bank
act,
and
senator
owen's
suggestion,
admitting
it,
that
it
go
in
precisely
after
this
introductory...
introductory
clause
introducing
revised
statutes
5202.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
correct,
your
honor.
but
they
have
no...
congress
cannot
amend
a
nonexistent
law.
now,
if
congress
had
enacted...
essentially,
reenacted
the
law,
then
we
would...
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
but
what
congress
purported
to
do
was
strike
out--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--correct,
your
honor,
that
we
would
be
in
a
very
different
situation.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
in
that...
in
that
instance,
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
again--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--well,
i
think
it
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
amended...
whether
congress
would
be
constrained
by
the
use
of
the
word
amended
to
read
as
follows.
this
court
has
interpreted
that...
that
language
as
meaning
that
con...
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
enact
an
entirely
substitute
provisions.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
large
difference
between
congress
reenacting
new
language
and
showing
in
fact
that
they
are
reenacting--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--they
struck
out
what
they
thought
was
a
statute
that
was
already
on
the
books.
but
they
were
wrong.
and
as
con...
you
know,
as
this
court
noted
in
town
of
south
ottawa,
whether
by
inadvertence
or
whether
they
were
misled
by
the
parties
who
were
lobbying
at
the
time,
it
can't
effect
a
reenactment
of
a
law
that
wasn't
in
existence.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
well,
correct,
your
honor.
although
what...
what
the
court
was
articulating
was...
was
a
theory
of
statutory
constructure...
construction,
and
the
notion
of
exactly
what
has
to
happen
in
order
for
an
act
to
be
passed.
there's
no
court
that
i
know
of,
and
certainly
petitioners
have
cited
no
court
which...
which
has
ever
held
that
by
striking
out
or
seeking
to
strike
out
a
provision
of
a
repealed
statute
it
effectuates
a
reenactment
of
that
law.
chadha
makes
quite
clear
you
have
to
go
through
the
very
precise
constitutional
steps
in
order
to
enact
a
law.
for
instance,
if
congress
held
a
lot
of
hearings
and...
and
you
read
through
the
hearings
and
read
through
the
committee
reports,
and
it
looks
as
if
congress
really
wanted
national
banks
to
sell
insurance,
if
they
didn't
pass
the
law,
if
they
didn't
write
it
on...
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
became
the
enrolled
bill
and
present
it
to
congress,
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
thought
was
good
policy
or
whether
they
wanted
to
enact
it.
one
thing
i
think
is
helpful
in
terms
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
1918
congress
did,
is
not
just...
you
need
not
only
focus
on
what
the
text
of
the
1918
act
says,
which
clearly
restates
5202,
omitting
section
92,
but
every
extant
description,
apart
from
the
statutes
at
large,
of
section
5202
showed
section
92
as
part
of
5202.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
there
were
two
privately
published
compilations
that
tried
to
create
a
code,
the
kind
of
code
that
we
now
have
and
can
rely
upon.
both
of
those
private
publishers
placed
section
92
in
5202.
in
addition,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
overlook
this,
there
was
a
compilation
created
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
now,
petitioners
misleadingly
describe
that
compilation.
in
fact,
that
compilation
clearly
sets
out
section
92
in
only
one
place.
that
place
is
within
revised
statutes
5202.
there
is
a
section
of
the
comptroller's
compilation
which
seeks
to
sort
of
put
together
the
current
version
of
all
the
revised
statutes.
so
they
set
out
in
5202
and
then
list
the
paragraphs
that
are
included
within
it.
included
within
that
is
section
92.
in
a
separate
section--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
and
where
it
appeared
was
in
the
comptroller's
description
of
the
federal
reserve
act,
as
amended
up
through
that
date.
the
federal
reserve
act
was
first
enacted
in
1913,
amended
twice
in
1914,
one
in
1915,
and
then
we
have
this
1916
amendment.
what
the
comptroller
did
there
was
to
pull
together
all
of
those
amendments.
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
peel
away
the
sections
of
the
federal
reserve
act
that
were
amendments
to
preexisting
law.
so
when
you
read
through
the
text
of
the
federal
reserve
act,
it
includes
amendments
to
at
least
10
different
sections
of
the
revised
statutes,
and
sets
it
out
in
text
describing
it,
beginning
with
section
5202
is
hereby
amended
to
read
as
follows.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
there
was
no
ambiguity,
your
honor.
there
is
only
one
way
you
can
read
it.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
no,
your
honor,
because
the
1918
act
would
not
have
cleared
up
the
ambiguity.
what
the
19--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--because
then
what
you
would
have
is
two
different
versions
of
5202...
one
that
was
enacted
that's
a
stand-alone
provision
that
was
amended
in
1918,
and
one
that's
embedded
somehow
within
the
federal
reserve
act
that
wasn't
changed.
the
1918
act--
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
--correct,
your
honor.
the
1918
act
did
more
than
just
strike
out
section
92.
it
added
a
new
limitation.
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
yes.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
i
think
there's
no
question
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
power.
and
certainly
the
united
states
agrees,
your
honor.
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
as
to
whether
the
court
should
reach
the
issue.
and
the
petitioners,
the
united
states...
the
bank
does
not
agree...
but
the
united
states
agrees
that
there
was
a
proper
exercise
of
jurisdiction
here,
and
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
just
as
the
court
in
arcadian
and
kamen
found
that
it
could
resolve
legal
issues
on
grounds
not
presented
or
not
argued
by
the
parties,
so
too
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
authority
to
do
so,
and
properly
exercised
its
discretion
here.
ms.
ann
mary
kappler
correct...
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
be
an
odd
game
of
sorts,
yes.
unless
there
is
anything
further.
thank
you.
