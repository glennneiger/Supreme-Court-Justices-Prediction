justice
byron
r.
white
you...
you
can't
find
the
section
in
the
united
states
code
now,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
were
they,
the
compilers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
in
any
event,
the
code
has
omitted
it
since
1952?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
and
yet
the
banking
authorities
have
continued
to
say
it
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but...
but
it
would
seem
to
me
the
banking
authorities
have
any
doubt
about
it
would
have
suggested
that
congress,
that
they...
they
enact
something
called
section
92.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
be
right
that...
that
paragraph
9
might
have
some
connection
with
liabilities,
but
paragraph
8
has
no
relevance
to
what
5202
deals
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
was
there...
there
wasn't
a
committee
report
on
that?
that
was
just
his
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
you...
what
if
this
case
had
come
up
before
1952,
do
you
think
you
could
have
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
have
overcome
the
presumption?
justice
byron
r.
white
amendments
to
a
nonexistent
provision...
i
suppose
those
amendments
were...
passed
both
houses
and
they
were
signed
by
the
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
they'd
a
said
section
so
and
so
is
amended
to
read
as
follows?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
there...
at
the
same
time,
however,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a...
by
your
account,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
provision
to
amend.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
there's
really...
you
think
there's
really
a
major
difference
between
that
way
of
amending
and
the
way
they
actually
amended
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't
reenact
new
language.
they
said
that...
they...
well,
they
did
rephrase
what
they
thought
was
a...
a...
a
statute
already
on
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wright,
what
about
those
other
sections,
other
than
92?
how
about...
is
section
92
roughly
what
paragraph
9
is
on
71a?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
same...
the
same
problem
or
the
same...
all
of
these...
8,
9,
10...
8,
9
and
10
will
suffer
the
same
fate--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
they...
don't...
but
don't
they
claim
that
they
were
repealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
even
though
they
had...
they
really
were
part
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
controls
the
other
two,
i
would
think.
