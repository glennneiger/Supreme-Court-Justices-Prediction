paul

mr.
wright,
can
i
interrupt
you.
i...
i
read
these
briefs
a
little
while
ago,
and
it's
hard
to
get
the
sequence
in
mind.
on
page
77a,
the
section
13
was
enacted
in
1913,
right.
and
then
the...
what
the
bottom
begins,
1913?
justice
john
paul
stevens
everything
from
77a,
on,
is...
was
enacted
in
1913?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we...
we...
and
we
have
two
more...
there's
a
1916
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
a
1918
statute
we
have
to
deal
with,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
well...
well,
you're
just
concentrating
on
1913
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
i
want
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
think
that
there
were
intended
to
be
quotation
marks...
opening
quotation
marks
in
front
of
section
5202
on
the
next--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
in
other
words,
what
we
do...
if
you're
to
follow
you,
you
would
move
the
closed
quote
from
after
united
states
to
an
open
quote
beginning
with
section
15?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
where
should
we
place
the
quotation
marks
where
we
will
best
understand
your
understanding
of
what
the
statute
really
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
what
do
you
do
with
the
opening
quotation
mark
after
the
colon
in
the
third
line,
before
national
bank,
do
you
make
that
an
internal
quote?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
moved
those
to
the
beginning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
says
to
read
as
follows,
and
you
don't
put
any
quotes
around
what
is
to
read
as
follows?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
put
a
closed
quotation
mark
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
marked
"fifth:
liabilities
incurred
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
reserve
act?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
make
it
really
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
make
it
even
more
clear,
i
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
ask
you.
do
you
think
the
changes
in
the
u.s.
code
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute
have
any
bearing
on
what
was
intended
when
the
statute
was
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
shouldn't
we
look
at
the
u.s.
code
for
the
period
right
after
the
enactment,
rather
than
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that
in
1952,
or
whenever
it
was,
when
the
code
was
published
omitting
this
section,
that
that
worked
a
change
in
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
changing
the
presumption,
in
your
view,
must
have
changed
the
law,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask.
did...
does
the
present
version
of
the
code
omit
all
three
paragraphs,
8,
9
and
10?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
just
curious,
who
was
the
chairman?
was
that
congressman
celler?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask.
i
know
you
think
the
law
is
perfectly
clear,
but
assuming
that
we
thought
there
was
an
ambiguity,
a
tension
between
the
language
and
the
quotation
and
the
punctuation,
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
try
and
resolve
the
ambiguity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
way
i
asked
you
to.
normally,
we
often
look
at
legislative
history.
some
of
us
think
we
shouldn't,
but
do
you
think
the
court
would
be...
and
consistent
with
normal
statutory
construction
principles,
would
be
permitted
to
look
at
legislative
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
wouldn't
it
be
relevant
if
there's
an
absence
of
any
stated
reason
for
repealing
these
provisions,
whereas
the
discussion
makes
sense
if
you...
if
you
treat
it
the
way
the
government
would
interpret
it?
isn't
that
relevant?
