mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
unusual
case
arose
out
of
a
dispute
concerning
the
proper
construction
of
section
92
of
the
banking
laws,
a
provision
that
authorizes
banks
in
small
towns
to
sell
insurance.
no
question
was
raised
about
the
validity
of
section
92.
in
fact,
the
insurance
agents
pointed
out
that
at
this
late
date,
they
thought
there
was
no
real
question
about
whether
section
92
remained
in
existence.
they
pointed
out
that
the
controller
of
the
currency
and
the
federal
reserve
board
has
assumed
its
continued
existence
for
more
than
70
years;
that
the
banking
industry
and
the
insurance
industry
had
relied
on
section
92;
and
that
congress
and...
and
the
courts
had...
had
as
well.
but
the
d.c.
circuit,
nevertheless,
held
that
section
92
had
been
repealed
by
congress
in
1918.
and
that's
the
question
presented
to
this
court
today.
the
dispute
between
the
parties
has
necessarily
turned
on
a
few
phrases
and
some
quotation
marks
in...
in
a
number
of
documents
that
were
written
more
than
70
years
ago.
and
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
those
documents
this
morning.
but
before
i
do
so,
i...
i'd
like
to
say
two
things
about
what
i
think
close
analysis
of
these
documents
shows.
the
first
thing
it
shows
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
repeal
section
92.
the
second
circuit
has
issued
a
decision
on
this
issue
since
the
d.c.
circuit
handed
down
the
judgment
in
this
case.
and
the
second
circuit,
in...
in
holding
that
section
92
had
not
been
repealed,
stressed
the
clarity
of
the
evidence
showing
that
this
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and,
indeed,
the
insurance
agents,
while
they
are
now
defending
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
that...
that
section
92
has
been
repealed,
they
do
not
claim,
as
i
understand
it
anyway,
that
congress
intended
to
repeal
section
92.
but
i
don't
want
to
give
what
i
think
is
the
false
impression
that
this
case
presents
some
sort
of
clash
between
congress's
intent
and...
and
the
text
that
congress
enacted.
the
second
point
that
i
think
that
a
close
analysis
of
the
documents
that
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
this
morning
shows
is
that
in
fact
the
text
of
those
documents
supports
the
conclusion
that
section
92
was
not
repealed.
and...
and
i...
and
i
hope
to
show
that
the
only
thing
that's
really
on
the
insurance
agents'
side
of
this
dispute
is
some
quotation
marks.
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
it...
it
is...
it
is
true
that
in
1952
the
compilers
of
the
united
states
code
replaced
section
92
with
a
statement
that
says
omit
it.
and...
and
it's
followed
by
an
explanation
that
section
92
was
repealed
in...
in...
in
1918.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they...
they're...
they're
an
official
body
whose
statements
about
what
the
law
is,
is
prima
facie
evidence
of
what
the
law
is.
if
i...
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
about
that,
since...
since
you
brought
it
up.
first,
the...
the
1926
edition
of
the
u.s.
code,
the
1934
edition
of
the
u.s.
code,
the
1940
edition,
and
the
1946
edition
all
contain
section
92.
that
is
to
say,
the...
in
fact,
the
1926
edition
of
the
u.s.
code
was
the
very
first
edition
of
the
u.s.
code--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--since
1952,
the
code
has
omitted
it.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
after
the
cod...
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
about
that
is
after
the
1952
codifiers
decided
that
the
prior
codifiers
has
been
wrong--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
raised
this
issue,
congress
held
hearings
on
the
subject.
and...
and
apparently
decided
that
it'd
stayed
in
effect
since...
since
congress
has
twice,
in
the
last
11
years,
actually
amended
section
92.
of
course,
the
holding
that
section
92
was
repealed
makes
those
congressional
enactments
totally
superfluous.
the
controller,
since...
since
almost
the
day
after
section
92--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
of
course,
if
that
had
ever
happened,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but...
but...
but...
every--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--but
the...
a...
a...
as
i
say,
the
regulations
governing
sales
of
insurance
by
banks
in
small
towns
have
been
in
effect
since
1916,
have
continued
in
effect
to
this
day.
this
case
just
involved
an
interpretation
of...
of...
of
whether...
of
to
whom
banks
in
small
towns
may
sell
insurance.
and
as
i
say,
even
the
insurance
industry
thought
that
there
was
no
question
about
the
continued
existence
of
section
92.
and
as
judge
pratt
emphasized
in
his
district
court
opinion,
you
know,
the
banking
industry
has...
had
relied
on
this
provision.
a
lot
of
banks
in
small
towns
have
made
substantial
investments
in...
in
the
insurance
business.
and...
and...
and
have
relied
on
the
controller
and
everyone
else's
assumption
in
the
operation
of
their
business
to...
that
section
92
exists.
well,
if
i
may,
let
me...
let
me
turn
to
these
documents
for...
for
a
moment.
i...
there
are
many
versions
of
them
printed.
i...
i
have
the...
the
bank's
cert
petition
in
front
of
me
and...
and
i
was
hoping
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page...
page
77a
of
that...
of
the
appendix
to
that
petition,
which...
which,
on
that
single
page,
presents
two
of
the
critical
statutes
that
are...
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
dispute
between
the
parties
re...
really
boils
down
to
was
this
provision,
section
92,
was
it
added
to
revise
statute
section
5202
or
was
it
added
to
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act?
and
both
of
those
provisions
are
actually
printed
on
this
page
of
the
appendix.
section
5202
is
up
at
the
top
of
the
page.
and
i'd
just
like
to
make
a...
a
brief
note
about
that
provision.
it
had
actually
been
in
effect
in
some
form
or
another
since
1863.
it...
and
it
had
always
dealt
with
the
same
thing.
it...
it...
it
involves
the
excess
indebtedness
that
national
banks
may...
may
incur.
and
the
version
that's
printed
in
the
bank's
appendix
here
is
the
way
section
5202
looked
before
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act
was
enacted
in
1913.
now,
right
under
that,
about
halfway
down
the
page,
is
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act
just
the
way
it
was
printed
in
1913,
the...
the...
which
is
when
the
federal
reserve
act
was
enacted
for
the
first
time.
so
everything
in
this
provision
basically
is
new,
with
one
exception.
and
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
that
exception
which
appears
on
page
79a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
yes,
your
honor.
however,
near
the
bottom
of
page
79
of
the
appendix,
you'll
see
a
paragraph
that
begins:
"section
5202
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
united
states
is
hereby
amended
so
as
to
read
as
follows.
"
and
it
then
reprints
section
5202,
the
provision
we
were
just
looking
at,
almost
exactly
the
way
it
existed
before
1913,
with
one
addition.
and
that
addition
appears
on
page
80a
of
the
appendix.
it's
the
line
that
begins
fifth,
and
says
that
liabilities
incurred
under
the
provisions
of...
of
the
federal
reserve
act,
that
banks
may
also
incur
those
in
excess
of
their...
of
their
capital.
this
is
a...
a
strange
provision,
at
least
today,
a
peculiar
practice,
that
section
5202
was
amended
as
part
of
the
federal
reserve
act,
right
in
the
middle
of
a
number
of
other
provisions
amending
the
federal
reserve
act.
this
appendix
doesn't
show
it,
but
we've
just
been
looking
at
the
1913
vers...
i
mean
of
section
13,
the...
section
12
of
the
federal
reserve
act
is
right
before
what's
printed
here,
section
14
of
the
federal
reserve
act
is
what
comes
right
after
what's
printed
here,
and...
and
in
fact
it
goes
1
through
16
around
this.
but
at
that
time
congress
had
the
peculiar
habit
of
occasionally
amending
the
revised
statutes
as
part
of
an
act.
i'd
also
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
very
next
paragraph
on...
on
page
80a,
a
paragraph
that
i
think
is
very
important.
it's...
it's
the
key
to...
to
our
textual
argument
here
today.
it
involves
the
re-discount
authority
of...
of...
of
federal
reserve
banks.
that
provision
was
clearly
part
of
section
13
of
the...
of
the
federal
reserve
act
in
1913.
and...
and
that's
shown
by...
by
a
couple
of
things,
one
of
which
is
reading
the
text.
it
very
logically
belongs
in
the
federal
reserve
act.
this
provision
grants
the
federal
reserve
board
authority
over
the
rediscounting
practices
of
federal
reserve
banks,
and
it
logically
belongs
in
the
federal
reserve
act
for
that
reason,
rather
than
in
some
other
provision
of
the
banking
statutes.
another
thing
about
this
provision
is
that
it
includes
the
phrase,
"this
act".
"this
act"
are
the
last...
last
word
of
the
third
line
and
the
first
word
of
the
fourth
line.
it
is
undisputed
that
"this
act"
means
the
federal
reserve
act.
the
insurance
agents
agree
with
us
on
that.
we
say
that
it
refers
to
the
federal
reserve
act
as
this
act
for
the
straightforward
reason
that
it
was
part
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
now--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes...
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the...
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--everything
from
77a
to
79a
is...
is
all
the
1913
version,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but
if
i
may
turn
to
1916,
that...
that
is
at
page
67a
of
the
appendix.
and
that
is
the
next...
the
next
few
pages
are
all
part
of
the
1916
amendments,
which
is
where
most
of
our
attention
has...
has
concentrated
in
the
briefs.
let
me...
let
me
point
out,
right
at
the
top
of
that
page
the
title
of
this
act.
it
says
it's
an
act
to
amend
certain
sections
of
the
act
entitled
federal
reserve
act
approved
december
23rd,
1913.
now,
that
title
doesn't
have
controlling
authority,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
more
detail
in
our
brief,
the
practice
at
that
time
was
that
congress
had
two
kinds
of
titles.
one
was
a
descriptive
title,
you
know,
an
act
to
improve
the
federal
banking
system
or
something
like
that.
the
other
sort
of
title
congress
used
was
this
sort
of
title.
it
identified
the
acts
that
were
being
amended.
now,
what
it
did
when
it
listed
the
acts
that
were
being
amended,
it
had
some
awfully
long
titles
because
they
listed
everything
that
was
being
amended.
this
one
lists
the
federal
reserve
act.
it
says
nothing
about
revised
statute
5202
being
amended.
and
that's
important
because
we
don't
think
section
5202
was
amended
in
1916,
and
the
insurance
agents
think
it
was.
now,
towards
the
bottom
of
page
67a
comes
an
indentation,
and
then
it
says
section
13...
that
section
13b
and
is
hereby
amended
so
as
to
read
as
follows.
so
congress
is
mending...
is
amending
section
13,
which
we
were
looking
at
a
minute
ago.
and
the...
the
bank,
in
the
appendix,
has
added
these
little
numbers
in
the
parenthesis.
ever...
everything
else
is
just
the
way
it
appeared
in
the
statutes
at
large,
but
there...
there
are
then
10...
10
numbers
in
the
margins
which
are...
which
were
added
by
the
bank.
the...
the
insurance
agents,
the
bank
and
the
controller
all
agree
that
the
first
six
paragraphs
were
part
of
section
13.
where
we
start
dis--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
every...
everything
else
is
the
way
it
looked
in
the
statutes
at
large.
but
when
you
get
to
page
70a
and
you
get
to
that
paragraph
that
begins
number
7,
that's
where...
that's
where
there
is
some
disagreement.
we
contend
that
7,
8,
9,
and
10
are
all
part
of
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
the
insurance
agents
say
that
they
were
all
moved
into...
into
revised
statute
5202.
and
that's
important
to
their
argument
because
they're
going
to
say...
they
then
say
that
when
revised
statute
5202
was
amended
in
1918
and
congress
didn't...
didn't
include
the
paragraphs
numbered
8,
9
and
10,
those
paragraphs
all
got
repealed.
now,
i'd
like
to...
i'd
like
to
focus
again
on
paragraph
number
8,
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
70a.
that's
the
paragraph
i
was
looking
at
just
a
minute
ago.
it
is
almost
identical...
it's
the
rediscounting
paragraph...
it's
almost
identical
to
the
paragraph
the
way
it
existed
in
1913.
just
a
couple
of
words
were
changed.
and
i'd
like
to
make
the
two
points
again
that
i
made
before.
first,
it
refers
to
"this
act".
we
say
it
refers
to
"this
act"
because
it
was
part
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
and
if
we're
right
on
that,
we
win
this
case.
the
second
thing
is
that
it
again,
just
as
in
1913,
grants
the
federal
reserve
board
authority
over
re-discounting
practices
of
federal
reserve
banks.
this
provision
belongs
in
the
federal
reserve
act.
now,
the
argument
to
the
contrary
relies
on...
on
these
quotation
marks
that
you'll
see
if
you
look
closely
at...
at
the
1916
amendments.
in
paragraph
7,
following
that
introductory
phrase
about
section
5202
of
the
revised
statute's
being
amended,
there's
a
colon,
and
then
there
are
some
open
quotation
marks.
no
closed
quotation
marks
appear
again
until
after
the
paragraph
marked
number
10,
which
precedes
an
amendment
to
section
14
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
the
insurance
agents
argue,
on
the
basis
of
those
quotation
marks,
that
congress
actually
moved
that
re-discounting
paragraph
out
of
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act
and
into
section
5202
in
1916,
and
then,
in
1918,
omitted
it
altogether.
and
that's
important
in
this
case
because
they
contend
that
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
paragraph
numbered
9
here.
and
that
paragraph
numbered
9
is
the...
is
the
paragraph
that's
ultimately
at
issue
here.
nine
is
the
one
that
grants
banks
in
small
towns
the
authority
to
sell
insurance.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
your
honor,
because
section
7
is,
as
i...
as
i
tried
to
say
at
the
start,
it's
just
the
same
as
in
1913.
it's
this
peculiar
provision
that's
part
of
section
13,
but
it's
clearly
meant
to...
to
amend
section
5202.
so
there
was
a
separate
section
5202
and
it
was
amended,
and
congress
knew
that
people
were
going
to...
were
going
to
draw
out
section
5202
of
the
revised
statutes
from
time
to
time
and
look
at
this
provision.
and
it
had
to
say...
congress
had
to
say
federal
reserve
act
in
that
provision
because
otherwise
a
reader
of
section
5202
wouldn't
know
what...
what
the
provision
was
talking
about
if
it
just
said
something
like--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
"this
act",
in
that
next
paragraph,
on
the
other
hand,
could
logically
say
"this
act"
because
it
was
part
of
the
federal
reserve
act,
in
our
view.
now,
let
me
say
that
there...
there...
congress
actually
took
note
of
the
quotation
marks
that
are
the
heart
of
the
insurance
agents'
case.
what
happened...
and
this
is
detailed
in
the
lodging
that
was
filed
by
the
bank
if
you
follow
through
all
the
documents...
when
congress...
the
original
bill
in
1916
included
some
quotation
marks,
it
did
not
include
these
confusing
quotation
marks
that
were
ultimately
on...
in...
that
ultimately
appeared
in
the
statutes
at
large.
the
quotation
marks
that
were
on
the
original
bill
just
started
at
the
beginning
of
section
13
is
hereby
amended,
and
ended
at
the
end.
so
there
is
nothing
about
that
original
bill
that
would
make
you
think
that
section
92
got
moved
out
of
section
13.
in
the
senate,
congress
actually
focused
on
those
quotation
marks,
had
a
brief
discussion
in
which
everyone
agreed
they
were
confusing,
voted
to
delete
the
quotation
marks,
and
in
fact,
in
the
final
print
of
the
house
bill
and
the
final
print
of
the
senate
bill,
there
are
no
quotation
marks.
someone
added
them
back
in...
no
one
knows
whom...
they
appear
in
the
statutes
at
large,
though,
and
we
acknowledge
that.
but
the
point--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's...
that's...
that's
probably
right,
if
those...
if
those
closed
quotation
marks
weren't
there,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
a
problem.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
your
honor,
that's
the
way
it
appeared
on
the
original
bill.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's...
that
that's
probably
what
congress
really
meant.
that's
the
way
it
appeared
on
the
original
bill.
remember,
though,
if
you're
talking
about
what
congress
intended
here,
congress
actually
voted
to
get
rid
of
these
quotation
marks.
they
didn't
want
them
at
all.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
you
place
them
exactly
where
you
just
suggested.
if
you
get
rid
of
that
closed
quotation
marks
and
move
the
open
quotation
marks
to
the
beginning
of
section
5202--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i...
i
moved
those
to
the
beginning
of
section
52--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
that's...
that's
the
way
it
appeared.
there
were
no
quotation
marks
after
that
colon
on
the
original
bill.
i
think
that
that's
probably
the
fairest
guide
to...
to
what--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
if
you
did
that,
certainly--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yeah,
that
would
make
it
really...
i
don't
think
you
need
to
do
that,
but
that
would--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
would
certainly
solve
matters,
yeah.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i...
i...
i
think
you
do,
but
the
enrolled
bill
also
had
the
text
of
the
provision.
it
had...
it
had
that
rediscount
provision
that
i've
been
pointing
to.
it
had
the
word
"this
act"
in
that
provision,
which
meant
the
federal
reserve
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
my
argument
is
that
they
were
not
meant
to
have
interpretive
significance
and
that
there
is
textual
ambiguity
on
the
enrolled
bill.
because
the
enrolled
bill,
besides
the
quotation
marks,
also
had
the
phrase,
8
in
its
entirety,
which
logically
belongs
in
the
federal
reserve
act.
if
you
follow
these
quotation
marks
and
give
them
the
meaning
that
the
insurance
agents
say
they
should
have,
you
do
violence
to
the
actual
words
that
congress
enacted.
and
in
our
view,
the
words
of
what
congress
enacted
deserve
more
significance
than
the
quotation
marks
that
were
part
of
the
enrolled
bill.
and
i
think
once
we've
introduced
this
textual
ambiguity,
under
anyone's
view,
it
should
be
perfectly
fair
to
look
at
what
congress...
how
those
quotation
marks
got
there.
and
when
you
look
at
how
those
quotation
marks
got
there,
it
is
absolutely
clear
to
anyone
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
have
them
there.
and
it's
just
as
clear
in
1918
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
get
rid
of
this
provision.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
and...
and
if
you...
and
if
you
adjust
that
rule
to
say,
well,
there
is
some
ambiguity
here,
we're
going
to
take
a
look
at
what
congress
intended,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
drafting
history
and
that
sort
of
matter,
then
we
surely
win.
because
it
certainly
would
be
a
perverse
rule
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
on
the
enrolled
bill
by
holding
that
congress
repealed
a
statute
in
the
face
of
pretty
clear
evidence
that
it
didn't
mean
to
do
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
recall
any
case
like
that,
your
honor.
there
certainly
haven't
been
many.
but
i
don't
know
what
else
the
court
could
do
if
there's
an
ambiguity
on
the
enrolled
bill.
it
has
to
be
resolved.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there
are
certainly
plenty
of
cases
of
this
court
saying
that
punctuation
is
the
poorest
guide
to
congress's
intents.
surely
the
text
ought
to
control
over
the
punctuation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's...
it's
hard
to
imagine
every
possible
future
case.
i
certainly
wouldn't
have
imagined
this.
but
i
think
that
we're
very
comfortable
with
the
general
rule
that
the
words
almost
always
mean
more
than
the
punctuation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
these
documents.
we
were
said
to
have
been
misleading
about
what
was
in
the...
this
is
a
1917
collection
of
the
banking
laws
that
the
controller
of
the
currency
compiled
and
was
published
by
the
senate.
it's
an
official
senate
document.
this
is
what
justice
souter
was
referring
to
a
minute
ago.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
senate
document
412,
and
it's
cited
in
the
briefs.
in
1917,
what
the
controller
thought
had
happened
in
1916
was
that
section
92
appeared
twice.
it
appears
in
the
federal
reserve
act
and
it
appears
in
the
national
banking
act.
now,
this
is
another...
this
is...
and
this
is
actually
i
think
the
more
significant
document...
it's
also
cited...
this
is
the
1920
compilation,
after
everything
that's
most
relevant
had
happened,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
senate
published
another
collection
of
the
banking
laws.
it
was
also
compiled
by
the
controller.
the
controller
thought
that
section
92
was
still
in
existence,
and
it
was
still
in
existence
in
only
one
place,
in
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
and,
as
justice
souter
said,
one
explanation...
in
fact,
the
explanation
that
flows
most
logically
from
the
d.c.
circuit's
reasoning
is
that
congress
may
well
have
thought
that
two
versions
of...
two
versions
of
section
92
were
one
too
many,
and
it
cured
that
in
1918.
and
after
1918,
there
was
one
and
only
one
version
of
section
92
and
it
was
located
in
the
federal
reserve
act,
until
1926,
when
the
first
compilers
of
the
u.s.
code
moved
it
to
12
usc,
section
92.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there
is
certainly
one
reading
of
those
quotation
marks
that
is
contrary
to
what
congress
intended--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
is
possible.
and...
and
the
confusion
is
illustrated
by
that
1917
compilation
i
was
just
referring
to
which
showed
section
92
twice.
but
the
1920
compilation
shows
it
once,
and
for
70
years
everyone
has
assumed
that...
everyone
has
operated
on
the
assumption
that
section
92
is
in
existence.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
the
only
change
is
that
a
few
words
were
stricken
in
1982
by
congress.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and...
and
let
me
say
that
i
thought
it
was
significant
that
the
insurance
agents
agree
that
8
and
10
had
to
go
into
the
federal
reserve
act
in
1916.
they
think
that
9
belongs
more
logically
in
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
but
they
all
go
one
place
or
another.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they
claim...
they
claim
they
were
all
repealed,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
although,
if
i
could
remind
the
court,
at
oral
argument
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
counsel
for
the
insurance
agents
said,
and
i
quote,
that
they
quote,
cannot
advance
a
substantial
argument
that
section
92
no
longer
exists,
unquote.
that's
what
they
said
a
few
months
ago.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
that
they're
not
repealed
either.
they
went
along
with--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--although,
of
course,
only
section
92--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--is
actually
at
issue
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
and
the
controller
believes
that
those
other
two
provisions
are
in
effect
as
well,
along
with
section
92.
thank
you.
