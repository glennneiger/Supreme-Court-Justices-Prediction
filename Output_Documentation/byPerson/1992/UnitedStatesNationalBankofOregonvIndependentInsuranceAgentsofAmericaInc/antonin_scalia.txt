justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
why
they
didn't
do
it?
i
knew
they
must
have
had
a
reason?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
aren't
we
supposed
to
accept
that,
then?
you
shouldn't
tell
us
all
of
this,
should
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
don't
want
to
know
that.
don't
we
just
take
the
statutes
at
large
as
they
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
i
close
my
ears,
mr.
wright.
[laughter]
mr.
wright,
my
ears
are
still
open.
let
me
just
assure
you
that
i
follow
what
you're
saying,
because
it
is--
--mr.
wright...
we're...
yeah,
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry,
did
i...
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
no,
i
didn't...
i
interrupted
you.
i
just...
would
you
tell
us,
looking
at
70a,
where
the
quotation
mark
should
be
omitted
and
replaced?
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
the
run-over
paragraph
on
70a,
which
ends
with
a
quotation
mark
after
united
states,
that
is
the
quotation
mark
you
say
should
be
omitted?
they
intended...
that
you
say
would...
to
get
the
proper
meaning
across,
should
be
ignored?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
you
may
be
arguing
the
other
side
of
that
some
day.
do
you
really
want
us
to
adopt
that
rigid
a
rule,
that
the
word
always
governs
over
the
punctuation?
i
mean,
surely
how
much
sense...
how
much
sense
it
makes
with
different
punctuation,
versus
how
much
sense
it
makes
with
different
languages
enters
into
the
matter?
i
mean,
you
know,
how
much
of
a...
of
a
seeming...
seemingly
foolish
bill
is
created
if
you...
if
you
ignore
the
punctuation,
versus
how
much
of
a
seemingly
foolish
bill
is
created
if
you
ignore
the
language.
i
think
it's
a
very
rigid
rule
to
say
just
ignore
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
kappler,
i
can
agree
with
that,
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
language,
8?
that
makes
no
sense
as
included
in
section
5202,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
there's
no
ambiguity,
but
there's
only...
there's
no
ambiguity
because
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
the
one
is
intended
to
be
in
5202,
and
that's
why
they
say
the
provisions
of
the
federal
reserve
act,
and
the
other
one
is
meant
to
be
in
this
piece
of
statute
that's
being
amended.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
do
you...
how
do
you
explain
the
subsequent
statutes
that
amend
this
nonexistent
provision?
what
do
you
do
with
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
surely
in
deciding
what
a
law
means,
we
try
to
reconcile
new
laws
with
old
laws,
and
read
them
together
in
such
a
way
that
they...
that
they
make
sense,
one
with
the
other.
and
if
it's
possible
to
read
the
old
law
in
such
a
way
that
the
new
amendments
are
not
vain
acts,
why
shouldn't
we
read
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
that,
that
would
justify
going
to
legislative
history,
even
if
one
were
so
disposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
contest
the
point
in
principle
that
congress
may
have
been
ineffective
in
enacting
its
intent?
i
mean,
that
that
is
theoretically
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
that
if
it
was,
then
congress
simply
failed
to
enact
what
it
meant
to
enact?
that
that
is
a
possibility...
that
is
possible,
theoretically
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
government's
position
that
those
other
provisions
are
repealed,
not
repealed,
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your...
the
two
sides
are
in
disagreement
as
to
all
three
of
those--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
at
issue
here.
