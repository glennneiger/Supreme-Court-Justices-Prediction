justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
part
of
your
submission,
mr.
wright,
that
in
the
paragraph
that's
numbered
7
at
the
very
end,
where
it
says
"fifth:
liabilities
incurred
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
"
that
that
reference
would
have
been
unnecessary
if
section
7
was
amending
the
federal
reserve
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
that
was
my
point,
since
it
stood
separately,
it
had
to
reference
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
is
it
then
in
the
previous
paragraph
that
the
statute
uses
the
word
the
federal
reserve
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
provision
that's
marked
8
here
the
only
provision
in
the
federal
reserve
act
that
applies
specifically
to
national
banks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
paragraph
9.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there...
were
there
other
statutes
enacted
later
that
applied
only
to
national
banks
and
that
were
outside
of
the
federal
reserve
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but...
but
afterwards?
