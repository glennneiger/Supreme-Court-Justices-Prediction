but
all
of
the
southern
employees
didn't
in
one
sense.
those
whose
pensions
had
vested
and
were
receiving
payments
i
take
it
remained
with
the
plan,
did
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
don't
see
how,
in
light
of
that,
your
syllogism
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
is,
is
that
under
the
statute...
under
the
statute
as
you
read
it,
these
are
still
employees
of
the
withdrawing
employer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
the
way
you
interpret
it,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
extension
of
your
argument
is
that
even
if
some
employees
of
a
particular
employer
leave,
the
result
would
still
be
to
transfer
the
assets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
(c)
then
does
control
those
payments
that
are
valid,
and
those
which
are
invalid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
