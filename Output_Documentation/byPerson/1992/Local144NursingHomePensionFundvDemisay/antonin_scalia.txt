justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rose,
if
they
had
done
so,
would
there
have
been
a
remedy
against
them
under
302...
under
302(e)?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
if
they
had
transferred...
not
just
transferred
it,
but
had
transferred
assets
to
a
union
official.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
it's
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
see,
i'm
not
sure
what
your
theory
of
the
operation
of
302(c)
and
302(e)...
what
you
theory
is.
does
it
not
operate
at
all,
once
the
trust
is
established...
so
long
as
you
establish
a
trust
which
on
its
face
meets
the
requirements,
that's
the
end
of
the
application
of
302,
or
does
it
continue
to
have
some
application,
at
least
if
you
violate
the
term
of
the
trust
by
turning
over
the
money
to
union
officials?
what's
your
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
whatsoever,
so
long
as
the
trust
is...
complies
with
the
statute
on
its
face.
i
mean,
on
its
face
the
trust
has
to
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
so
long
as
it
does
on
its
face,
if
the
officer...
if
the
trustee
violates
the
trust,
and
surreptitiously
conveys
money
to
union
officials,
you
think
you
can
only
get
at
that
under
erisa.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
done
answering
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
jump
in
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
back
to
the
same
problem
that
you
gave
one
answer
to
and
then
took
it
back.
are
you
sure
you
want
to
stick
with
your
second
answer?
i
don't
see
how
the
statute
requires
anything
except
that
the
money
be
placed
by
the
employer
in
trust
for
that
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
a
violation
by
the
trustee
later,
does
that
necessarily
violate
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
enforceable
against
the
trustee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
it
makes
a
nice
division
between
this
provision
of
the
labor
relations
act
and
erisa
a
little
less
neat.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
richman,
(a)
and
(b)
establish...
of
302
establish
the
criminal
violations.
(a)
makes
it
a
violation
for
the
employer
to
pay
over,
or
to
agree
to
pay
over,
lend
or
deliver
the
money,
for
the
benefit
of
anyone
other
than
his
employees,
okay.
that's
(a).
(b)
does
not
make
it
a
violation
for
the
recipient
to
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
anyone
except
the
employees.
it
doesn't
say
that
at
all.
it
says,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
request,
demand,
receive,
or
accept
or
agree
to
receive
or
accept
for
any
other
purpose
than
the
employees.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
agreement
that
it's
directed
at.
it
does
not
make
it
criminal
to
go
back
on
what
was
originally
a
valid
agreement.
isn't
that
at
all
significant,
that
it
explicitly
criminalizes
the
agreement
but
says
nothing
about
violation
of
the
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
(c)
is
an
exception
from
what
has
been
criminalized
in
(a)
and
(b).
if
it
hasn't
already
been
criminalized
in
(a)
or
(b),
you
don't
have
to
come
within
the
exception.
so
if
it's
not
criminal
under
(b)
to
go
back
on
what
was
originally
a
valid
agreement,
and
although
you
told
the
employer
you
were
going
to
use
it
for
his
employees,
in
fact
you
use
it
for
something
else,
you
haven't
violated
(b).
you
don't
need
the
exception
of
(c).
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
your
criticism
is
not
with
the
protective
value
of
(c).
your
criticism
is
with
(b).
you're
just
saying
(b)
wasn't
drawn
broadly
enough,
but
congress
drew
it
as
broadly
as
it
wanted
to.
it
made
the
crime
accepting
it
for
a
purpose
other
than
the
benefit
of
the
employees,
or
agreeing
to
accept
it
for
such
a
purpose.
it
did
not
make
it
a
crime
to
go
back
on
a
trust
agreement
and
use
it
for
your
own
benefit,
or
for
some
benefit
other
than
the
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
(e).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
says
to
restrain
violations,
but
it's
no
violation
of
this
section
to
break
a
trust
agreement.
it's
a
violation
to
make
a
bad
trust
agreement,
but
not
to
break
a
good
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
(c)(5)
is...
(c)
is
entitled,
exceptions.
it
is
an
exception
to
the
criminal
provisions
of
(a)
and
(b).
now,
if
anything
here
is
criminal,
it
is
criminal
under
(b),
and
there
is
no
language
in
(b)
which
makes
it
criminal
to
do
anything
except
to
accept
the
money,
or
to
request
the
money,
or
to
receive
the
money,
on
terms
that
do
not
require
its
use
for
the
employees.
that's
all
that
(b)
criminalizes,
so
you
don't
even
have
to
look
to
(c),
until
you
first
establish
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
(b),
and
i'm
asking
how
you
can
establish
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
criminal
statutes...
i
mean,
normally
we
interpret
criminal
statutes
strictly,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
one
way
for
civil
purposes
and
another
way
for
criminal
purposes?
we
don't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
richman,
why
don't
you
argue...
you
are
arguing
that
this
transfer
is
in
breach
of
the
trust...
of
the
valid
trust
agreement,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
which
means
that
the
trust...
the
trust
agreement
was
valid
under
302(c)(5),
and
this
was
in
breach
of
it.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
argue
the
opposite...
that
it
is
not
in
violation
of
the
trust
agreement,
but
to
the
contrary,
it
is
fully
in
accord
with
the
trust
agreement?
that
means
that
the
trust
agreement
is
invalid
under
(b),
and
therefore
you
would
have
to
apply
the
(c)
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
to
get
302
to
apply,
you
have
to
show
that
the
trust
agreement
is
invalid,
so
your
case
ought
to
be
that
this
payment
was
perfectly
okay
under
the
trust
agreement,
but
that
renders
the
trust
agreement
invalid
under
(b),
unless
the
(c)
exception
applies,
which
you
say
it
doesn't.
never
mind.
that's
all
right.
[laughter]
well,
on
the
interrelation
between
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
i
take
it
the
structure
of
the
statute
is
that
any
payment
to
the
trust
would
be
invalid
under
(a),
and
that's
why
(c)
is
necessary
to
save
it,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
not
your
adversary,
mr.
rose
he's
your
friend.
your
clients
are
adversaries,
you
and
mr.--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
say
there
was
no
answer
to
the
argument,
mr.
rose.
i
just
said
it
was
an
argument
that
would
get
you
over
the
(b)
problem,
anyway...
the
subsection
(b)
problem,
which
really
sticks
in
my
craw.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rose,
excellent.
[laughter]
