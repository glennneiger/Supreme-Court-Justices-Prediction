justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
subsection
302
regulates
solely
the
conduct
of
the
employer
in
making
the
payment
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
they...
criminally,
or
simply
in
equity,
to
enforce
the
trust?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
just
equitable
enforcement.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
richman,
doesn't
your
theory
overlook
the
fact
that
subsection
(5)
is
couched
in
terms
of
money
or
other
thing
of
value
paid
to
a
trust
fund
established
for
these
purposes?
isn't
the
reference
to
paid,
as
opposed,
for
example,
to
money
or
things
of
value
held...
doesn't
that
indicate
that
a
violation
or
not
is
to
be
judged
with
respect
to
the
terms
of
the
fund
at
the
time
the
money
is
paid
over?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
does
302(c)(5)
help
you
if
the
union
official
runs
away
with
the
money
in
any
case?
aren't
we
talking
about
contests
about
the
enforcement
of
certain
terms
of
trusts,
or
the
enforcement
of
certain
benefits
as
against
trustees
and
employers,
and
so
long
as
the
terms
of
the
trust
and
the
payments
to
the
trust
are
made
in
accordance
with
trust
terms
that
satisfy
the
requirements
of
subsection
(5),
isn't
that
all
subsection
(5)
is
really
trying
to
get
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it
will
enforce
the
terms
of
the
trust--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you
want
to
do
something
other
than
enforce
the
terms
of
the
trust.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
standards
simply
refer
to
money
paid
in
trust,
meeting
certain
requirements
set
out
in
subsection
(5),
and
if
the
money
is
in
fact
paid
in
accordance
with
those
terms,
how
does
subsection
(5)
provide
any
other
standard
by
which
a
court
is
supposed
to
do
anything?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
i'm
not
seeing
your
point.
let's
assume
it's
being
held
in
trust
and
you
can
enforce
as
against
the
trustees
their
obligation
to
hold
it
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
trust.
how
is
my
suggestion
subversive
of
that
safeguard?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
trustees
have
got
an
obligation
to
honor
the
terms
of
the
trust.
i'm
not
suggesting
otherwise.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
they
do...
i
mean,
how
am
i
suggesting
that
the
trustees
can
change
the
terms
of
the
trust?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
calculating
benefits
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
have
any
authority
to
change
the
terms
with
respect
to
the
identification
of
beneficiaries?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
could
say...
are
you
suggesting
that
they
could
say
well,
the
employees
of
the
x
corporation
will
no
longer
get
benefits,
even
though
we
received
funds
expressly
for
that
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
couldn't
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
kind
of
change
that's
at
issue
here,
isn't
it?
