mr.
henry
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
genesis
of
this
action
occurred
when
the
respondent
employers
withdrew
from
the
petitioner
multiemployer
pension
and
welfare
benefit
plans.
in
this
action,
those
withdrawing
employers
seek
to
require
the
petitioner
benefit
funds
to
transfer
a
portion
of
their
plan
assets
to
new
benefit
plans
which
are
not
parties
to
this
action
which
were
established
after
the
withdrawal
of
those
withdrawing
employers.
the
district
court
granted
petitioners'
motion
for
summary
judgment.
however,
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
held
that
a
fair
portion
of
the
reserves
reflecting
contributions
made
to
the
greater
funds
on
behalf
of
the
southern
employees
should
be
reallocated
to
the
southern
funds.
what
is
extraordinary
and
erroneous
is
that
the
court
below
held
that
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
1947,
was
the
controlling
law
and
that
it
required
the
transfer
of
assets.
302(c)(5)
says
nothing
about
transfers
of
assets,
nor
does
its
legislative
history
even
mention
such
transfers.
the
court
below
has
not
only
misread
section
302(c)(5)
but
has
misread
and
misapplied...
failed
to
apply...
this
court's
decision
in
united
mineworkers
v.
robinson.
the
focus
of
302(c)(5)
is
specific.
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
robinson,
302(c)(5)
was
meant
to
protect
employees
from
the
risk
that
funds
contributed
by
their
employers
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
and
their
families
might
be
diverted
to
union
purposes,
or
even
to
the
private
benefit
of
faithless
union
leaders.
there's
no
such
allegation
in
this
case.
with
particular
reference
to
the
requirement
in
302(c)(5)
that
a
benefit
plan
be
maintained
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
employees,
this
court
stated
that
its
plain
meaning
is
simply
that
employer
contributions
to
employee
benefit
trust
funds
must
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
employees
and
their
families
and
dependents
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others,
and
especially
pertinent
for
the
instant
action,
this
court
specifically
concluded
in
robinson
that
nothing
in
302(c)(5),
quote,
places
any
restriction
on
the
allocation
of
the
funds
among
the
persons
protected
by
302(c)(5).
even
the
narrow
holding
in
robinson
is
applicable
here.
that
is,
that
the
federal
courts
have
no
authority
under
section
302
to
review
for
reasonableness
a
collectively
bargained
term
of
an
employee
benefit
plan.
that
describes
the
present
case.
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
which
the
respondent
employers
were
parties
are
clear
that
the
terms
of
the
trust
agreements
are
incorporated
by
reference,
and
those
trust
agreements
prohibit
the
payments
that
the
second
circuit
has
ordered.
it
is
submitted
that
the
trustees
in
this
case
certainly
breached
no
fiduciary
duties
in
administering
the
trust
in
accordance
with
their
trust
agreements.
mr.
henry
rose
if
the
trustees
had
transferred
assets?
mr.
henry
rose
to
a
union
official--
mr.
henry
rose
--yes.
mr.
henry
rose
to
a
union
official,
that
would
have--
mr.
henry
rose
--justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
section
302(c)(5)
does
not
regulate
the
transfer
of
plan
assets
whatsoever.
mr.
henry
rose
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
rose
there...
it
might
constitute
criminal
activity,
also.
it
might
constitute
a
criminal
violation
either
under
state
law
or
under
federal
law
independently,
but
you're
right,
i
would
relegate
that
to
a
regulation
under
erisa,
clearly.
mr.
henry
rose
that
is
its
focus,
absolutely.
as
we've
noted,
the
section
302(c)(5)
requires
employer
contributions
to
be
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
employees,
but
those
are
for
the
employees
of
all
of
the
contributing
employers,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
petitioner
funds
have
done.
mr.
henry
rose
oh,
i
think
that...
i'm
sorry,
i
think
that
would
violate
it.
the
money
would
have
to
be
used
for
the
benefits
of
contributing
employers.
mr.
henry
rose
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
a
criminal
violation
under
302,
yes.
mr.
henry
rose
there
is
under
erisa,
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
henry
rose
they
clearly
were
not
followed.
with
regard
to
the
pension
plan
here,
the
erisa
provisions
are
very
clear.
the
erisa
provisions
bar
a
transfer
unless
certain
statutory
conditions
are
met.
one
of
them
is
review
by
the
pension
benefit
guarantee
corporation.
this
was
not
done.
furthermore,
such
a
transfer
is
at
the
discretion
of
the
transferor
plan,
and
clearly
the
petitioners
did
not
initiate
the
proposed
transfer,
and
third,
the...
any
such
transfer
would
have
to
be
a
transfer
not
only
of
benefits
or
of
assets,
but
of
liabilities,
and
there
is
and
there
was
proposed
no
transfer
of
liabilities.
there
is
no
contention
in
this
case
that
the
contributions
were
used
for
purposes
other
than
benefits
or
employees
of
contributing
employers.
the
second
circuit--
mr.
henry
rose
--yes.
mr.
henry
rose
yes.
mr.
henry
rose
well--
mr.
henry
rose
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
strict
reading
of
the
statute
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
implying.
however,
this
court
has
stated
in
arroyo
and
in
robinson
that
the
specific
provisions
in
section
302(c)(5)
are
enforceable
under
302(e).
mr.
henry
rose
yes,
and
although
i
think
there's
some
difficulty,
logically,
coming
to
it,
i
don't
think
that's
a
difficulty
that
needs
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
rose
yes.
yes,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
rose
well,
section
302
is
a
criminal
statute.
however,
section
302(e)
allows
injunctive
relief
to
enjoin
a
violation
of
section
302.
mr.
henry
rose
yes.
the
second
circuit
has
interpreted
the
solely
exclusive
language
so
expansively
as
to
judicially
legislate
that
there
must
be
a
reallocation
of
money
in
the
petitioner
funds.
neither
the
second
circuit
nor
the
respondents
explained
how
such
a
mandated
reallocation
is
to
be
reconciled
with
this
court's
conclusion
in
robinson
that
nothing
in
section
302(c)(5)
places
any
restriction
on
the
allocation
of
the
funds
among
the
persons
protected
by
section
302(c)(5).
mr.
henry
rose
if
they
had
decided
that
they
want
to
do
it,
and
there
was
a
transfer
of
liabilities
together
with
the
transfer
of
assets,
yes,
it
may
have
been
possible.
mr.
henry
rose
it
would
have
been
clearly
consistent
with
erisa
had
they
wanted
to
do
it
with
regard
to
the
pension
plan.
there's
some
doubt
as
to
whether
that
is
true
with
regard
to
the
welfare
plan.
in
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendments
act,
there
is
a
specific
procedure
for
doing
so,
and
so
it
clearly
could
have
been
done
if
in
their
discretion
they
had
wanted
to
make
the
transfer
of
both
liabilities
and
assets.
there...
it's
not
so
clear
that
they
can
do
it
in...
without
violating
the
prohibited
transactions
of
section
406
of
erisa
with
regard
to
the
welfare
plan.
mr.
henry
rose
there
is
a
specific
exception,
you
see,
to
40...
to
the
prohibited
transaction
with
regard
to
the
pension
plan,
but
there
is
none
with
regard
to
the
welfare
plan.
it
is
submitted
that
attributing
to
the
congress
an
intention
in
302(c)(5)
to
regulate
the
use
of
benefit
plan
assets
among
plan
participants
is
without
basis.
the
best
evidence,
of
course
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
as
we've
noted
already
in
answer
to
judge
scalia...
justice
scalia's
question,
302(c)(5)
is
an
exception
to
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
not
a
regulatory
statute.
it
says
nothing
about
the
transferring
of
plan
assets,
and
as
we've
noted,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
even
mention
it.
strongly
mitigating
against
the
second
circuit's
expansive
interpretation
of
302(c)(5)
are
the
dire
consequences
that
would
follow.
the
uncontroverted
expert
testimony
in
this
record
is
that
the
construction
of
the
second
circuit
would
undermine
the
viability
of
multiemployer
plans
generally.
contrast
such
a
result
with
the
congressional
intention
to
preserve
the
financial
integrity
of
multiemployer
plans
not
only
by
the
enactment
of
302
but
of
erisa
and
the
multiemployer
pension
plans
amendments
act
of
1980.
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
multiemployer
plans
as
a
delivery
system
of
employee
benefits
to
some
9
million
workers
and
their
families.
further
indicating
that
302
is
not
a
regulatory
act
is
the
fact
that
from
the
mid-fifties
to
the
early
seventies
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
became
increasingly
concerned
about
the
lack
of
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans,
and
this
concern
culminated
in
the
enactment
of
erisa
in
1974.
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
teamsters
v.
daniel,
quote,
congress
believed
that
it
was
filling
a
regulatory
void
when
it
enacted
erisa.
erisa
extensively
regulates
the
use
of
plan
assets,
including
transfers
of
assets.
this
is
to
be
expected
from
a
statute
which
this
court
has
described
as
comprehensive
and
reticulated.
erisa
includes
at
least
five
provisions
that
bear
on
the
transfer
of
assets
ordered
by
the
second
circuit,
and
each
one
of
them
would
prohibit
the
transfer.
thus,
we
have
the
anomaly
of
the
court
below
ordering
the
trustees
of
the
petitioner
funds
to
violate
erisa
and
the
court's
order
would
not
be
a
defense
to
the
violation
of
the
prohibited
transaction.
it
is
submitted
that
this
result
cannot
be
attributed
to
congressional
intent.
the
judgment
below
calls
into
question
basic
principles
underpinning
multiemployer
benefit
plans.
the
essence
of
multiemployer
plans
is
the
pooling
of
risks
among
many
employers
and
employees.
in
typical
multiemployer
plans,
employer
contributions
do
not
reflect
the
differences
in
work
force
demographics
of
contributing
employers.
for
example,
one
employer
may
have
a
work
force
with
an
average
age
of
50,
and
another
contributing
employer
may
have
a
work
force
with
an
average
age
of
30,
yet
they
pay
contributions
at
the
same
rate.
contributions
may
be
based
on
hours
of
service,
or
ton
of
coal
produced,
or
percentage
of
payroll,
as
in
the
case
of
the
petitioner
funds.
therefore,
for
example,
in
a
multiemployer
health
benefit
plan,
it
is
inevitable
that
the
value
of
the
health
benefits
needed
by
the
employees
of
some
contributing
employers
will
exceed
the
contributions
made
by
their
employers.
this
is
made
possible
because
other
contributing
employers
will
pay
contributions
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
benefits
received
by
their
employees.
but
the
court
below
says
that
when
an
employer
withdraws
from
the
plan,
section
302(c)(5)
requires
that
if
the
assets
of
the
plan
have
increased
during
the
period
of
the
withdrawal...
withdrawing
employer
contributing...
contributed
to
the
plan,
a
proportionate
share
of
that
increase
in
assets
must
be
transferred
to
the
plan...
by
the
plan.
according
to
the
court
below,
the
proportion
to
be
paid
is
the
ratio
of
the
contributions
of
the
withdrawing
employer
to
the
total
contributions.
the
second
circuit's
mandate
could,
if
taken
literally,
require
that
the
petitioner
funds
pay
out
substantial
moneys
even
if
the
benefits
received
by
the
employees
of
the
withdrawing
employers
exceeded
their
contributions.
as
a
plan's
obligations
grow,
normally
its
assets
also
grow.
thus,
the
proportionate
share
of
the
plan's
assets
which
the
court
below
would
require
the
plan
to
pay
upon
the
withdrawal
of
the
withdrawing
employer
would
also
grow,
and
thereby
encourage
withdrawals
and
the
ultimate
demise
of
the
plan.
the
court
below
thereby
would
impose
a
new
obligation
which
the
actuaries
and
trustees
did
not
and
could
not
take
into
account
when
they
were
projecting
the
cost
of
benefits
to
be
provided
and
other
costs
in
determining
the
level
of
contributions
needed
to
cover
those
benefits.
if
the
plan's
assets
can
be
invaded
in
such
a
major
way
as
the
court
below
has
mandated,
where
will
the
money
come
from
to
pay
for
the
benefits
the
plan
is
obligated
to
pay
in
the
future?
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
second
circuit's
holding
is
a
one-way
street.
if
the
plan's
assets
rise
during
the
participation
of
the
group
of
withdrawing
employers,
the
petitioner
funds
must
pay
out
plan
assets,
but
if
the
plan's
assets
diminish,
apparently
no
payment
to
the
petitioner
funds
would
be
required.
no
insurance
arrangement
can
survive
under
a
system
which
requires
paying
out
of
gains
and
absorbing
all
the
losses.
it
is
instructive
that
the
single
circumstance
where
congress
has
mandated
a
transfer
of
assets
from
one
multiemployer
plan
to
another,
that
congress
does
not
define
the
appropriate
amount
of
assets
to
be
transferred
with
reference
to
contributions
or
reserves.
the
only
situation
where
congress
has
mandated
transfer
of
assets
is
where
employees
move
from
one
multiemployer
plan
to
another
multiemployer
plan
as
a
result
of
a
certified
change
of
collective
bargaining
representative.
in
that
instance,
erisa
requires
a
transfer
of
an
appropriate
amount
of
assets,
and
that
term
is
statutorily
defined
in
section
4235(g)
of
erisa,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
at
page
48(a)
to
mean
the
value
of
the
nonforfeitable
benefits
to
be
transferred
minus
any
employer
withdrawal
liability
to
the
transferor
plan.
i
might
add
that
when
it
is
the
transfer
of
nonforfeitable
benefits,
which
is
the
same
as
vested
benefits,
it
is
the
transfer
of
the
obligation
to
pay
those
benefits
and
therefore
it's
the
same
as
the
transfer
of
liabilities.
in
the
present
case,
no
vested
benefits
have
been
transferred
to
the
respondent's
new
benefit
plans,
therefore,
even
if
there
had
been
a
certified
change
of
collective
bargaining
representative
in
this
case,
which
there
was
not,
since
it's
the
same
union
representing
both...
in
both
plans,
the
amount
of
assets
required
to
be
transferred
would
be
zero.
the
expansive
interpretation
of
302(c)(5)
and
the
failure
of
some
lower
federal
courts
to
apply
this
court's
robinson
decision
has
resulted
in
unnecessary
litigation
and
uncertainty
among
plan
sponsors.
some
federal
courts
even
assert
authority
to
rewrite
the
terms
of
benefit
plans
when
they
deem
them
to
be
unreasonable.
in
effect,
the
second
circuit
has
stricken
the
provisions
of
the
trust
agreements
barring
transfers
of
assets
in
this
case.
in
mahoney
v.
board
of
trustees,
just
less
than
6
months
ago,
the
first
circuit
held
that
a
decision
by
a
plan
sponsor
to
increase
retirement
benefits
of
retired
participants
in
a
lesser
amount
than
the
increase
for
active
participants
was
subject
to
review
by
the
federal
courts
as
to
whether
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
robinson
decision
was
not
discussed,
or
even
cited.
mr.
henry
rose
your
honor,
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be.
under
erisa,
the
state
law
is
preempted,
and
so
it
would
be
under
erisa
if
there
was
any
remedy
whatsoever.
mr.
henry
rose
well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
are
subject
to
the
ordinary
trust
law,
and
more.
in
fact,
erisa
is
much
stricter
than
traditional
trust
law.
even
under
traditional
trust
law,
the
courts
did
not
take
it
upon
them...
did
not
assert
the
authority
to
rewrite
the
basic
terms
of
trust
instruments
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonableness
test.
mr.
henry
rose
well,
lawsuits
are
brought
by
either
the
department
of
labor
for
a
fiduciary
breach
or
by
private
parties.
mr.
henry
rose
under
erisa,
absolutely,
yes,
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
henry
rose
yes,
your
honor,
it
has.
mr.
henry
rose
well,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the...
it
would
expedite
not
only
the
conclusion
of
this
case,
because
it
is
so
clear
that
erisa--
mr.
henry
rose
--i
think
technically
that
is
correct.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
give
some
guidance
beyond
that.
in...
in
phillips
v.
alaska
hotel
&
restaurant
employees
pension
fund,
the
ninth
circuit
recently
asserted
that
even
if
a
pension
plan
complies
with
erisa's
minimum
vesting
standards,
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
rewrite
the
terms
of
the
benefit
plan
to
require
the
plan
to
adopt
a
shorter
period.
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
henry
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
my
adversary
stated
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
surplus
at
the
time
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
respondent
employers.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
whatsoever
to
indicate
that.
mr.
henry
rose
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference,
justice
white.
the--
mr.
henry
rose
--not
these
clients.
the...
in
answer...
in
the
dialogue
just
preceding,
justice
scalia
suggested
that
the
argument
that
might
be
made
that
the
trust
might
be
invalid
and
thereby
bring
it
within
302.
i
would
suggest
that
if,
indeed,
this
trust
is
invalid,
then
virtually
all
multiemployer
plan
trust
agreements
are
invalid,
because
the
key
provisions
that
we're
talking
about
are
virtually
universal,
and
we
have
in
this
case
filed
the
trust
agreements
not
only
of
the
petitioner
funds,
but
of
the
respondent
new
funds,
and
you'll
find
similar
provisions
in
there,
and
you
also
have
in
the
amicus
briefs
the
trust
agreement
for
the
central
states.
mr.
henry
rose
it's
a
difficult
hurdle
to
get
over,
but
that
won't
do
it.
mr.
henry
rose
clearly,
that
erisa
does
not
require
a
transfer
of
assets
such
as
being
sought
in
this
case.
that
is
clear
from--
mr.
henry
rose
--for...
there
are
a
number
of
provisions.
it's
a
prohibited
transaction,
to
transfer
assets
to
a
party
in
interest.
the
respondent
employers
are
parties--
mr.
henry
rose
--that
is
correct.
it
certainly
is
not...
there's
absolutely
clear
that
it's
not
a
mandated
transaction,
but
it...
in
fact,
i
am
arguing
that
it
is
a
prohibited
transaction.
mr.
henry
rose
you're
quite
right,
you
don't
have
to.
i
would
hope
you
would.
[laughter]
there
was
a
suggestion
by
my
friend
that--
that
the--
mr.
henry
rose
--that
the
legislative
history
somehow
did
talk
about
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
plan,
and
i
would
question
that
that
is
so.
i
looked
at
it
very
carefully,
and
i
recall
none.
with
regard
to
the
prohibited
transaction,
though,
i
would
add
one
point,
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
stated
in
central
states
v.
central
transport
that
the
use
of
plan
assets
by
employers,
even
temporarily,
is
a
prohibited
transaction,
and
that
was
in
the
context
of
the
possibility
of
a
plan
not
seeking
collection
of
contributions
with
sufficient
expedition,
that
letting
it
ride
might
in
fact
be
a
prohibited
transaction
simply
because
it
is
an
extension
of
credit.
