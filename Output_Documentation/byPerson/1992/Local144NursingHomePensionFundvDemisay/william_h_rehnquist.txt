chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-610,
local
144
nursing
home
pension
fund
v.
nicholas
demisay.
mr.
rose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
sort
of
decision
be
reviewable
somewhere
under
the
law
of
trusts?
would
it
be
reviewable
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
you're
saying
that
congress
intended
that
these
trusts
be
not
subject
to
any
of
the
sort
of
supervision
that
other
trusts
are
in
court...
you
know,
the
usual
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
for
trustees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
entity
is
it
that
applies
erisa
in
reviewing
these
decisions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they're
adjudicated
in
court,
but
you
say
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
erisa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
view,
then,
erisa
has
superseded
traditional
common
law
trusts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rose.
mr.
richman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
again,
is
the
precise
language
in
(c)
that
confers
the
authority
on
the
courts
to
remedy
a
structural
defect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
it
says
is
jurisdiction
of
courts--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
restrain
violations--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
this
section.
how
does
that
confer
any
authority
to
remedy
structural
defects?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would
think
a
violation
of
this
section
would
mean
something
contrary
to
(a)
or
(b).
i
mean,
something
that
doesn't
conform
to
an
exception
would
not
necessarily
be
a
violation
of
the
exception...
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
unless
it
was...
as
i
think
justice
scalia
said,
unless
it
was
already
illegal
under
(a)
or
(b),
there
would
be
no
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
really,
it
would
be...
it's
quite
extraordinary,
isn't
it,
to
say
that
congress
put
all
of
the
things
that
you
want
to
see,
or
you
say
should
be
put
to
this
use,
not
in
a
more
general
statute
regulating
these
sort
of
agreements,
but
in
an
exception
to
a
criminal
provision,
a
rather
narrow
criminal
provision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richman.
mr.
rose,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rose.
the
case
is
submitted.
