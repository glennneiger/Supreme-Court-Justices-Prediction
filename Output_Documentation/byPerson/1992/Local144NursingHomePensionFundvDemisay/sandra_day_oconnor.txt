mr.
rose,
there
is
a
mechanism,
is
there
not,
whereby
plan
assets
and
corresponding
liabilities
could
be
transferred
to
a
new
plan,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
procedures
for
that
were
not
followed
here,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra

o'connor
mr.
rose,
if
we
were
to
decide
that
section
302(c)(5)
did
not
mandate
the
transfer
of
assets,
is
there
any
reason
why
we
have
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
erisa
issues
or
the
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
the
courts
below
didn't
grapple
with
that
at
all.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
correct
on
the
interpretation
of
302(c)(5),
that's
enough
up
here.
