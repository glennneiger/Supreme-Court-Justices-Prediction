i
don't
understand
why
it
wouldn't
violate
subsection...
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
wouldn't
violate
302(c)(5).
because
the
funds
were
not
held
in
trust
for
the
purposes
specified
in
the
statute,
but
were
given
to
the
union
official
as
a
bribe,
they
wouldn't
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statutory
restrictions,
and
if
it
goes
beyond
that
and
it's
a
payoff
to
the
union
leader,
why
then,
it
would
violate
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
really
follow
your
example,
are
you
saying
that
after
the
transfer
and
after
withdrawal
that
the
withdrawing
employers
continue
to
contribute
to
the
earlier
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
i
don't
know
what
you
were
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
to
confess
i
have
trouble
following
your
example.
you'd
helped
me
if
you
used
a
and
b--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
you
did
in
your
original...
assume
a
is
the
employees
of
the
withdrawing
employers
and
b
is
everybody
else
in
the
original
fund.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
b's
contributions
are
bad
because
they
are
used
for...
pay
some
benefits
for
a's
employees
even
though
a
is
no
longer
contributing
to
the
same
fund,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
opposite.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
at
the
time
any
one
employer
made
a
contribution
to
either
fund,
there
were
employees
of
that
employer
who
were
potential
beneficiaries
of
that
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rose,
in
response
to
questions
by
justice
o'connor
earlier
today,
she
suggested
that
maybe
all
we
have
to
do
is
decide
there's...
302(c)(5)
doesn't
justify
the
result
below.
you
said
you
wanted
us
to
go
on
to
cite
something
under
erisa.
just
exactly
what
are
you
asking
us
to
decide,
perhaps
unnecessarily.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
the
same
union.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
don't
have
to
say
it's
a
prohibited
transaction.
you're
just
saying
it's
not
a
mandated
transaction
under
erisa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
surely
don't
have
to
decide
that,
because
if
we
say
302(c)(5)
doesn't
justify
it,
and
it's
not
prohibited
by
erisa,
why
do
we
have
to
go
on
and
say
what
might
or
might
not
be
mandated?
