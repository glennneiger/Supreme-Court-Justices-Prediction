mr.
ronald
e.
richman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
plain
language
of
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
lmra
requires
that
contributions
made
by
an
employer
benefit
that
employer's
employees
either
alone
or
jointly
with,
in
a
pool,
as
most
multiemployer
plans
are
set
up,
with
contributions
of
other
contributing
employers.
in
the
language
of
the
syllogism
that
we
used
in
our
brief,
a
must
benefit,
or
a
and
b
must
benefit.
each
of
the
greater
funds,
both
the
pension
and
the
welfare
fund,
will
violate
302(c)(5)
unless
there
is
a
transfer
because
some
of
the
contributions
paid
by
the
southern
employers
helped
create
a
pool
surplus
in
each
of
the
greater
funds.
a
surplus
existed
in
each
of
the
funds
at
the
time
all
of
the
employees
of
the
southern
employers
withdrew
from
each
fund.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
yes,
they
did.
they--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--those
employees
have
withdrawn
from
the
plans,
but
they
are
entitled
to
benefit
payments
that
have
been
earned
by
them
prior
to
the
date
of
their
withdrawal.
in
other
words,
they
have
vested
in
pension
benefits.
they
have
a
nonforfeitable
right
to
receive
pensions
prior
to
the
time
that
the
withdrawal
occurred.
they
will
not
accrue
any
additional
benefits
subsequent
to
the
withdrawal.
they
will
not
have
the
opportunity
to
receive
any
benefit
from
the
surplus
that
has
been
created
by
the
employer's
contributions.
instead,
what
will
happen
is
they
will
have
their
benefits
paid
out
of
the
liabilities
of
the
plan,
those
liabilities
being
calculated
as
of
the
date
of
the
withdrawal.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
they
are
employees
of
the
withdrawing
employer,
but
as
we
read
the
statute,
all
of
the
contributions
that
go
into
these
funds
must
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
contributing
employer
either
alone
or
jointly
with.
some
of
these--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--no,
i...
we
think
that's
a
different
case,
because
if
some
of
the
employees
remain
in
the
fund,
they
will
be
earning
on
the
pension
side
benefit
credit.
on
the
welfare
side,
they
will
have
an
opportunity
to
receive
medical
and
other
coverage.
the
difference
is,
in
our
situation,
there
is
no
one
left
who
is
available
to
earn
a
benefit
beyond
the
benefits
that
are
already
calculated
in
the
liabilities
of
the
greater
funds.
when
only
half
of
the
employees
leave,
the
half
of
the
employees
that
remain
in
the
fund,
for
example,
are
still
entitled
to
medical
coverage,
and
they
may
have
many
catastrophic
events
that
occur
which
create
significant
liabilities
for
the
plan.
they
are
still
in
the
pool,
and
therefore
from
our
syllogism
some
of
the
employees
of
a
are
benefiting
in
the
pool
with
the
other
contributing
employers.
we
believe
that
to
be
distinctly
different
from
our
situation,
where
all
the
liabilities
are
fixed,
and
there
is
no
opportunity
at
all
for
the
southern
employees
to
receive
any
benefit
from
the
contributions
that
made
up...
that
went
to
make
up
this
surplus.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
if...
no,
we
don't
believe
so.
if
that
were
the
case,
the
entire
protective
value
of
section
302(c)(5)
would
be
essentially
eliminated,
because
once
the
money
went
in
on
friday,
if
on
monday
a
union
official
ran
away
with
the
money,
302(c)(5)
would
not
apply
its
protective
value,
which
is
reflected
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
we
don't
believe
so,
and
this
court
has
recognized
differently.
as
mr.
rose
pointed
out
in
robinson,
this
court
said,
it
is,
of
course,
clear
that
compliance
with
specific
standards
in
the
administration
of
these
funds
are
enforceable
under--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--no,
i
think
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--that's
correct.
we
want
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
specific
standards
in
302(c)(5).
one
of
those--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--if
that
is
the
interpretation
given
to
subsection
(5),
then
at
least
a
couple
of
the
structural
safeguards
don't
make
any
sense,
because
one
of
the
structural
safeguards
is
that
the
money
be
held
in
trust.
it
doesn't
say
it
must
be
received
by
the
trust
or
paid
to
a
trust,
it
says
that
it
must
be
held
in
trust.
in
addition--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--because,
as
i
understand
your
suggestion,
once
the
money
is
paid
in,
the
trustees
no
longer
have
an
obligation
to
follow
any
of
the
safeguards
of
302(c)(5).
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
but
they
could
change
the
terms
of
the
trust
immediately
after
receipt--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--well,
the
trustees
in
multiemployer
plans
generally
have
the
right
to,
and
do,
change
the
terms
of
the
trust
all
the
time.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
well,
no,
that
would
be
the
terms
of
a
plan.
they
change
the
terms
of
the
trust
in
terms
of
governance
of
these
plans,
in
some
cases
in
terms
of
objectives,
the
use
of
benefits
for
certain
purposes.
that
happens--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--yes.
not
only--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--no.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
no,
they
couldn't
do
that,
but
they--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--but
they
could,
for
example,
add
a
category
of
employees
to
receive
benefits
as
long
as
that
is
done
within
the
jointly
with
language.
our
proposed
rule
here
is
really
based
on
the
statement
in
robinson
and
statements
that
appear
in
amax
and
also
that
appear
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
302(c)(5),
while
certainly
to
fight
against
the
possibility
of
union
corruption,
but
really
the
overriding
goal
is
to
ensure
that
the
money
gets
used
for
the
participants
and
beneficiaries
for
whom
it
is
contributed.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
it
is
significant,
except
that
when
we
get
to
subsection
(c),
and
particularly
(c)(5),
which
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule,
the
statute
does
more
than
just
say
that
the
contributions
need
to
be
paid
in.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
if
that
were
the
case,
then
the
protective
value
of
all
of
the
provisions
in
(c),
really,
they
would
be
eliminated
completely.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
no,
it...
the...
302(e),
however--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--enables
the
district
courts...
it
provides
the
district
courts
with
jurisdiction
to,
in
the
parlance
that's
been
used
by
at
least
five
or
six
of
the
circuit
courts,
correct
structural
defects.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
well,
in
coming
back
to
this
court's
statement
in
robinson,
when
the
court
said
that
compliance
with
the
specific
standards
in
administration...
and
we
believe
that
that
statement
was
about
the
specific
structural
standards
in
302(c)(5)...
is
enforceable
under
302(e),
and
in
fact
the
robinson
case
itself,
a
unanimous
decision
by
this
court,
in
that
case,
if
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
had
been
that
the
limitations
apply
only
upon
receipt
of
contributions,
the
court,
instead
of
being
concerned
about
whether
302(c)(5)
created
a
reasonableness
standard
to
judge
whether
certain
benefits
violated
302(c)(5)
or
not,
would
have
easily
said,
we
don't
have
to
do
that
because
302(c)(5)
only
replies
to
the
receipt
of
money.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
if
that
were
the
case,
this
law
was
passed
more
than
25
years
prior
to
erisa,
and
we
believe
that
congress
thought
that
it
was
creating
some
safeguards
not
only
with
the
receipt
of
money,
but
that
the
money
would
go
into
these
funds,
and
then
it
also
would
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
for
whom
those
contributions
were
made.
and
there
are
a
number
of
statements,
which
appear
in
our
brief,
in
the
legislative
history
from
the
sponsor
of
this
provision
which
indicate
that
congress
really
thought
that
it
was
creating
structural
safeguards
not
only
for
the
receipt
of
the
contributions
but
for
the
actual
use
of
the
contributions
and
for
the
actual
administration
of
the
plan,
and
i
understand
the
concern
with
the
language,
but
to
read
the
language
not
to
apply
beyond--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--yes,
you
do,
but
this
is
not
being
applied
in
a
criminal
context,
this
is
applied
in
a
civil
context
under
302(e).
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
no,
i...
we
believe
that
under
302(e),
the
second
circuit
correctly
remedied
this
structural
defect
by
ordering
a
transfer
of
the
fair
surplus
in
the
greater
funds.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
that
appears
in
302(e).
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
to
restrain--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--violations.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
a
structural
defect
that
is
a
violation
of
one
of
the
specific
standards
in
302(c)(5),
in
our
case
the
standard
requiring--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--except
that,
and
again
getting
back
to,
really,
the
same
issue
that
i
was
talking
about
a
moment
ago,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
these
structural
safeguards
which
we
believe
that
congress
thought
it
was
adopting
not
only
for
the
receipt
of
contributions
but
for
the
actual
administration
of
the
plan
and
the
distribution
benefits
would
be
eliminated
completely.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
i
don't
understand
the
concern
with
the
language.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
this
court,
however,
did,
in
the
robinson
case,
both
in...
by
statement
and
terms
of
the
analysis
done
by
the
court,
indicate
that
it
had
really
adopted
what
we
had
been
referring
to
as
the
structural
defect
analysis,
again
because
if
the
court
was
not
concerned
with
the
actual
enforcement
of
section
302(c)(5),
then
the
court
in
robinson
would
have
simply
said,
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
how
benefits
are
distributed
and
whether
coal
miners'
wives
receive
some
type
of
benefit
or
a
different
type
or
a
lesser
benefit.
all
we're
concerned
about
is
the
actual
application
of
this
statute
to
the
receipt
of
the
contributions.
another...
if,
in
fact,
the
statute
is
read
the
way
that
you're
saying
it
should
be
read,
then
a
question
arises
as
to
the
greater
funds
have
received
contributions
subsequent
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
southern
employees
from
the
greater
funds.
they
have
received
those
contributions
from
1985
right
up
to
the
future,
and
continue
to
receive
those
contributions.
the
receipt
of
those
contributions
would
be
a
violation
because
they
are
receiving
those
contributions
without
actually
using
contributions,
albeit
contributions
received
earlier
for
the
protective
purposes
of
302(c)(5).
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
no.
what
we're
saying--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--okay.
the...
after
the
southern
employers
withdrew
from
the
greater
fund,
their
contributions
stopped
to
the
greater
funds.
the
contributions
continued
by
greater
employers
to
the
greater
funds,
and
those
contributions
continued
from
1985
to
the
present
date.
those
contributions
are
going
into
a
fund
in
which
contributions
which
were
made
previously
are
not
being
used
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
contributing
employees
who
made
those
contributions
previously...
in
other
words,
prior
to
1985...
and
to
read
the
statute
strictly,
we'd
end
up
in
a
situation
where
the
funds
continued
to
receive
contributions,
have
done
so
for
a
long
period
of
time,
when
contributions
that
were
received
prior
were
not
being
used
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
employers
who
contributed
those
contributions
at
that
time.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
okay.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
contributions
by
a
stopped.
contributions
by
b
continues
to
the
fund.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
if
the
statute
is
read
to
say
that
contributions
can't
come
into
these
funds
unless
the
contributions
are
used
in
accordance
with...
or
the
receipt
of
payment
cannot
occur
unless
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--no,
almost...
no.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
what
we're
saying
is
that
contributions
by
b
goes
in
and
they
benefit
b's
employees
at
a
time
that
contributions
by
a
going
in,
previous
contributions
by
a,
were
not
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees
of
a,
and
therefore
contributions
are
coming
into
a
fund,
but--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--that's
correct.
we
don't
believe
that
erisa
requires
a
different
result
here.
a
transfer
pursuant
to
302(c)(5)
can
be
accomplished
without
violating
a
single
rule
under
erisa.
we
can
meet
the
requirements
of
the
transfer
rules
under
1411(b),
for
example,
and
that
would
be
an
issue
that
the
district
court
would
be
able
to
deal
with.
our
interpretation
does
not
make
section
1415,
which
is
the
section
that
requires
mandatory
transfer,
superfluous.
section
1415
does
not
say
that
assets
or
liabilities,
or
assets
and
liabilities
will
be
transferred
only
if
there's
a
change
in
collective
bargaining
representative.
in
fact,
that
would
violate
the
position
of
the
government
that
these
transfers
are,
in
fact,
regulated
by
fiduciary
duty
obligations
pursuant
to
erisa.
in
addition,
transfers
can
occur
under
1415
that
would
not
occur
under
the
rule
that
we're
requesting
that
this
court
adopt.
they
would
occur
if
there
is
an
underfunded
plan,
for
example.
under
the
lmra...
under
the
rule
that
we're
proposing,
no
transfer
would
be
required
if
the
plan
does
not
have
excess
or
surplus
reserves.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
no.
we
are
arguing
that
this
transfer
is
in
breach
of
302(c)(5).
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
richman
thank
you.
