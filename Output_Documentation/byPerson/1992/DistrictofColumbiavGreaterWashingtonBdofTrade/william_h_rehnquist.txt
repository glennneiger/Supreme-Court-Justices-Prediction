william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-1326,
the
district
of
columbia
v.
the
greater
washington
board
of
trade.
ms.
murasky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
murasky.
mr.
postol,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
a
statute
provides
that
the
employer
shall
provide
10,000
dollars,
something
like
that,
health
insurance
for
all
of
his
employees,
something
along
the
lines
of
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
at
the
time
the
law
is
passed
there's
no
plan
in
existence
that
would
provide
for
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
employer
has
to
go
out
and
somehow
put
together
a
plan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
erisa
preempts
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
preempts
the
state
law.
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
that
definition
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
therefore
the
state
cannot
mandate
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
i--
--mr.
postol--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
isn't
as
clear
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
apparently
that
3(1)
includes
in
its
definition
of
plan
the
situation
where
the
state
simply
says
you
shall
provide
10,000
dollars
health
insurance
benefits
to
each
and
every
employee.
i
think
you
could
read
that
definition
as
dealing
with
plans
that
were
already...
the
state's
effort
to
affect
somehow
a
plan
that
was
already
in
existence.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
covers
something
simply
created
by
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
section
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it's
clear
to
you.
it
isn't
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you're
wrong
on
that
point,
a
state
statute
which
simply
brings
into
existence
a
benefit
isn't
the
same
as
a
state
statute
that's
dealing
with
a
plan
which
already
confers
benefits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
your
point
there,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
the
hypothetical
about
the
state
law
requiring
furnishing
of
insurance
ben...
or
health
benefits
to
every
employee
is
not
nearly
as
clearly
correct
as
perhaps
some
of
your
other
positions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
postol.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
murasky,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
murasky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
