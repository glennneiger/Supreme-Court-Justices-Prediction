justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
an
exemption
case?
it
was,
wasn't
it,
metropolitan
life?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
even
if...
i
suppose
that
some
plans
that
relate
to
are
nevertheless
exempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
some
statutes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the...
you
say...
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
this
employer
could
comply
with
district
of
columbia
law
by
a
separate
plan,
a
plan
separate
from
an
erisa
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
comply
with
it,
that
separate
plan
would
have
to
nevertheless...
the
benefits
would
nevertheless
have
to
be
keyed
to
the
erisa
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
separate
plan
would...
the
statute
would
nevertheless
relate
to
the
erisa
plans
through
the
separate
plan,
because
of
the
benefit
levels.
justice
byron
r.
white
--tell
me
again
if
you've
already
said
it,
if
this
employer
adopted
a
separate
plan
from
his
erisa
plan
and
said
this
is
for
the
specific
purpose
of...
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
the
district
of
columbia,
now,
why
would
it
be
preempted?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
a
plan
that
is
maintained
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
applicable
workmen's
compensation
laws
or
unemployment
compensation
or
disability
insurance
laws--
justice
byron
r.
white
--are
exempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
it
is
or
not,
you
get
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
under
that
plan
the
benefits
would
be
tied
to
the
level
of
benefits
under
the
erisa
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
this...
there's
no
question
that
this
district
of
columbia
law
is
part
of
the
workmen's
compensation
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
provision
about
the
level
of
benefits
is
part
of
the
law--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
this
separate
plan
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
that
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
effect
of
agreeing
with
you
that
this
law
is
preempted?
what
would
an
employer
pay
under
the...
would
the
workmen's
compensation
law
then
have...
tell
the
employer
what
he
has
to
pay
if
an
employer...
if
an
employee
is
injured
on
the
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
they'd
have
to
get
a
new
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
win...
if
you
win,
i
suppose
when
an
employee
is
injured
on
the
job
he
will
or
will
not
be
covered
by
the
existing
plan.
