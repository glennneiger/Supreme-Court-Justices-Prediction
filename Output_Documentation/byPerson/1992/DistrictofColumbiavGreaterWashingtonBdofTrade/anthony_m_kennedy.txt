anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
because
you
can
provide
health
insurance
coverage
without
having
an
erisa
plan?
you
simply
buy
a
policy,
group
policy
for
your
employees,
and
that's
not
erisa-covered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
an
employer,
say,
having
15
people
simply
wants
to
cover
his
employees
with
health
insurance
and
buys
a
group
insurance
policy,
that's
covered
by
erisa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
it
does
seem
that
the
statutory
scheme
here
does
impinge
on
erisa-covered
plans
in
almost
all
cases
in
that
the
employer's
liability
must
be
determined
by
the
contents
of
the
plan,
and
any
time
he
changes
or
she
changes
the
plan
in
any
way,
the
extent
of
liability
under
the
statute
changes.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
effect
incorporates
an
erisa
plan
into
your
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
be
true
in
the
state
wrongful
discharge
action
that
was
before
the
court
in
ingersoll-rand.
you
could
say
the
same
thing.
the
cause
of
action,
the
termination
tort,
preceded
erisa,
succeeds
erisa,
but
while
it's
in
force,
it
relates
to
erisa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
agree
that
this
is
a
covered
plan,
not
an
exempt
plan,
so
that
the
analysis
of
the
shaw
case
as
given
in
the
respondent's
brief
is
essentially
correct,
would
you
concede
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
different
than
in
shaw,
because
in
delta
v.
shaw
there
was
an
exempt
plan,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
here
there
is
not
an
exempt
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
not
the
one
that
arguably
preempts
this
statute.
the
health
insurance
coverage
is
not
exempt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
the
former
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
employer's
plan
here
in
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
state
says
that
all
employers
who
have
more
than
20
employees
must
provide
health
coverage
with
the
following
minimum
benefits--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
in
each
case
you'd
have
to
examine
the
erisa
plan
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
met
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
so
there
would
be
a
relation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
that
sense
because
under
the
hypothetical
statute
you
would
be
immune
from
liability...
suppose
there
was
a
punitive
sanction
for
refusal
to
do
this,
you'd
be
immune
from
liability
depending
on
an
interpretation
of
the
erisa
plan.
it
relates
in
that
sense,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
to
give
health
benefits
which
meet
the
following
specified
minimums.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
workers
compensation.
the
hypothetical
is
that
it
applies
to
all
employers
must
give
health
coverage--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
general
medical
coverage
for
all
employers
who
have
more
than
20
employees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
a
state
cannot
require
that
of
all
employees...
of
all
employers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have
to
accept
that
my
hypothetical
would
be
preempted
in
order
to
rule
in
your
favor
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
any
number
of
states
have
laws
which
measure
compensation
by
including
in
part
of
that
compensation
the
benefits
an
employee
receives?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
standard
health
plans.
in
other
words,
many
states
have
laws
in
which
they
measure
the
income
of
the
employee
by
including,
i
had
thought
until
i
heard
the
answer
to
your
question,
including
benefits
received
from
employee
plans--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
under
your
view,
all
of
those
statutes
are
preempted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
my
hypothesis--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
why?
i
thought
the
whole
theory
of
your
case
is,
is
that
if
you
have
to
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
plan
in
order
to
calculate
your
tax
liability,
it
automatically
relates
to
the
plan
and
it's
preempted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
isn't
quite
consistent
with
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
me
and
to
justice
white
and
to
the
chief
justice
when
we
asked
whether
or
not
there
could
be
a
statute
which
is
a
generally
free-floating
statute
which
says
you
must
provide
the
following
health
insurance
benefits.
you
say
no,
that's
preempted,
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
plan--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
the
answer
you
just
gave
me
now
about
the
tax
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
the
statute
before
us,
the
measure
of
the
employer's
liability
depends
on
a
calculation
based
on
the
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
why
you
say
it
relates.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
submit
that
the
same
happens
in
the
hypothetical
tax
statute,
where
for
some
employees
to
figure
their
tax
they
have
to
calculate
the
benefits
they
receive
from
the
plan.
i
don't
see
the
difference.
