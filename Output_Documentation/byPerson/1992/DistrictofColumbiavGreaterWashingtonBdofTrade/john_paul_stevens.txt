paul

that's
an
interesting
suggestion,
the
word
discriminate.
if
they...
aren't
the
benefits
under
the
plan
triggered
to
the
wage
rates
they
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
under
the
plan,
under
the
workmen's
compensation
scheme.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
you
pay
higher
wages
to
your
employees
you'll
have
to
pay
higher
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
discriminates
against
employers
who
pay
high
wages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
anybody
who
gives
health
benefits,
not
just
erisa-covered
plans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
could
give
health
benefits
without
having
an
erisa-covered
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
you
buy
insurance
for
your
employees
without
having
an
erisa-covered
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
if,
say,
they
figured
the
premiums
for
the
health
benefits
were
10
dollars
an
hour
for
the
employees,
or
something.
could
they
say
that
we
will
treat...
for
purposes
of
workmen's
compensation
we
will
require
that
you
treat
an
equivalent
of...
raise
your
salary
level
that
much
for
purposes
of
compensating
or
figuring
the
workmen's
compensation
rate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
same
idea...
they
also
wouldn't
pay
higher
wages,
because
they
might
have
to
pay
higher
workmen's
comp.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
raise
your
wages
the
same
thing's
true,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
an
employer
had
a
health
plan
in
which
he
gave
the
employees
an
option
of
either
participating
in
the
plan
or
receiving
a
wage
increase
equivalent
to
the
amount
necessary
to
pay
the
premiums
for
that
kind
of
health
coverage?
could
the
district
treat
that
portion
of
the
salary
as
part
of
the
standard
for
determining
compensation
under
workmen's
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about...
i
understand
the
general
application
statute.
i'm
talking
about,
say
in
the
employer's
plan,
instead
of
itself
paying
the
premiums
for
health
coverage
it
gave
the
employee
the
option
of
taking
the
amount
of
the
premium
as
additional
wages
so
the
employee
could
buy
his
own
health
coverage,
if
they
did
that,
could
the
district
treat
that
additional
increment
of
wages
as
part
of
the
standard
for
determining
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
this
is...
the
statute
is
exactly
as
it
is
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
i
guess
you're
right,
you
have
to
change
the
statute,
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my...
do
they
or
don't
they
in
my
hypothetical,
where
the
employer
gives
the
employee
the
option
of
taking
increased
wages
or
letting
the
employer
use
the
same
economic
benefit
to
buy
health
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
would
say,
regardless
of
which
option
the
employee
takes,
that
amount
will
be
used
in
the
standard
for
computing
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
refers
to
the
kind
of
hybrid
that
i've
just
hypothesized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
for
those
employees
who
took
the
wages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
district
law
that
taxes
the
receipt
of
health
benefits,
would
that
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
one
that
gives
a
company
a
deduction
for
paying
health
benefits,
a
tax
deduction?
is
that
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
go
back,
because
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
your
position
is.
could
the
district
in
your
view
pass
a
statute
requiring
all
employers
to
provide
health
insurance
for
people
on
workmen's
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just...
the
statute
just
says,
every
employer
in
the
district
must
provide
certain
minimum
health
insurance
coverage
for
its
employees
who
are
receiving
workmen's
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
do
that.
but
why
wouldn't
that
be
mandating
an
erisa
plan,
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--every
health
insurance
covered
plan
is
an
erisa
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
so
that
comes
within
the
exception.
okay.
