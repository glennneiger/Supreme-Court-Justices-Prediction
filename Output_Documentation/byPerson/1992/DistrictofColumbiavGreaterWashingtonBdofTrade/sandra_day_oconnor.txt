well,
ms.
murasky,
i
thought
the
court
said
in
the
ingersoll-rand
case
that
a
state
law
that
is
premised
on
the
existence
of
an
employee
benefit
plan
covered
by
erisa
is
preempted,
and
i
just
don't
see
how
you
get
around
ingersoll-rand.
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
that
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor

it's
premised
on
a...
to
the
extent
that
it's
measured
by--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
erisa
plan
benefits.
