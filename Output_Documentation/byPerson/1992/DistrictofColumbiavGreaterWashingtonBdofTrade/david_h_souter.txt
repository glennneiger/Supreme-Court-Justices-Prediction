justice
david
h.
souter
thank
you.
to
put
it
in
a
cruder
way,
if
you
lose
on
the
question
of
whether
it
relates
to,
you
lose
the
case,
do
you
concede
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
guess
i
didn't
understand
your
last
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
what
i
thought
at
first,
and
then
i
thought
perhaps
you
were
modifying
your
position.
do
you
agree
that
the
plan
about
which...
the
relationship
to
which
we
are
arguing
is
a
plan
which
is
covered
by
4(a)
of
the
title?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
it's
covered,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right,
if
it's
covered
by
erisa,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
lose
on
the
relationship
argument
you
have
nothing
left.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
are
you
saying
that
the
description,
and
i'm
reading
from
514(a)
i
guess,
here,
that
the
two
conditions
stated
in
the
following
description
relate
to
different
plans?
it
says
that
erisa
shall
supersede
any
and
all
state
laws
insofar
as
they
may
now
or
hereafter
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan
described
in
section
4(a).
if
you
lose
the
relationship
argument,
we're
talking
about
a
plan
described
in
4(a)--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
agree
there...
and
not
exempt
under
4(b).
are
you
saying
that
the
phrase,
not
exempt
under
4(b),
relates
not
to
the
erisa-covered
plan
but
to
the
requirement
of
your
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
description
here
described
in
section
4(a)
and
not
exempt
under
4(b)
relates
or
is
speaking
to,
is
referring
to,
the
same
plan.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
in
other
words,
there's
an
erisa
plan
covered
by
4(a).
you
concede
that
if
you
lose
the
relationship
argument
we've
got
an
erisa
plan
covered
by
4(a).
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me...
is
that
correct?
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth,
but
i
think
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
you
concede
that
if
we...
if
you
lose
the
relating-to
argument,
the
plan
to
which
this
relates
is
covered
by
4(a).
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
postol,
do
you
agree
that
the
plan
in
question
here
is
maintained
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
a
state
worker's
comp
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
despite
the
fact
that
it
provides
by
keying
the
health
benefits
it
provides
something
which
it
need
not
necessarily
provide
in
order
to
comply
with
the
worker's
comp
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it's
purpose
rather
than
particular
requirement
that...
rather
than
the
mandatory
nature
or
nonmandatory
nature
of
any
particular
benefit
which
is
dispositive
in
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
goes
to
relating
to,
doesn't
it?
