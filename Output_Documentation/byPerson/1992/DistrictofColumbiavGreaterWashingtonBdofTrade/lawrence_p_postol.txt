mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
respondent
sees
this
case,
it
is
simply
an
issue
of
whether
a
state
may
discriminate
against
an
employer
based
on
the
fact
that
employer
gives
health
benefits
to
its
employees,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
found
in
the
erisa
statute.
congress
made
a
decision
that
any
state
law
that
relates
to--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--the...
no,
not--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes.
congress--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes,
which--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--but
not
based
on
the
erisa-covered
plan.
what
congress
did
is...
and
it
made
a
conscious
decision.
it
said
states--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes,
but
health
benefits
are
an
erisa-covered
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
but
that
insurance
is
a
covered
erisa
plan.
the
giving
of
the
benefits,
whether
through
self-insurance
or
insurance,
is
a
covered
erisa
plan
under
section
4(a),
so
that...
your
honor
is
correct.
the
state...
what
congress
did...
and
it's
sort
of
neat.
what
they
said
was,
states,
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
in
workers
comp
with
one
limitation.
you
cannot
interfere
with,
you
cannot
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan.
so
you
can
judge
it
on
wages,
as
a
circuit
court
below
held,
you
can
say
you
have
to
give
x
number
of
health
benefits,
which--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
as
this
court
has
held,
the
analysis...
and
the
question
is
essentially
does
the
law
still
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan?
this
court
has
held
that
if
it's
a
general
application
statute
that
has
only
remote
or
peripheral
effect,
then
it
doesn't
relate
to
it,
but
if
you
single
out
the
covered
erisa
plan,
this
court
has
always
held
that
if
you
single
out
the
covered
erisa
plan
the
law
relates
to
it,
even
if
it
has
a
good
effect.
so
that
in
mackey
this
court
struck
down
a
state
law
that
acts
exempted
to
cover
the
erisa
plan
from
garnishment,
because
it
singled
it
out.
so
that
to
any
extent
that
the
state
wants
to
make
liability,
whether
through
equivalent
benefit,
whether
through
increasing
the
average
of
a
wage,
to
the
extent
they
single
out
the
covered
erisa
benefits,
there's
preemption,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is,
congress
recognized
the
natural
effect,
that
if
in
fact
you're
going
to
make
employers
workers
compensation
liability
increase,
the
natural
tendency
is
employer
will
therefore
decrease
their
covered
health
insurance.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yeah,
but
the
connection
is
direct,
and
that
is
that
the
employer
knows,
every
time
i
change
my
covered
health
insurance,
or
self
insurance,
it's
going
to
cost
me
money
in
my
workers
compensation
scheme,
so
sure,
if
it
was--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--but
the
wages
are...
will
be...
well,
first
of
all
the
wages
would
be
a
general
application
statute
not
specific
to
erisa.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
well,
the...
yes.
well,
i
don't
know
that
they
dealt
with
the
wages,
but
they
did
deal
with
the
health
insurance
and
they
wanted
to
encourage
health
insurance.
i
don't
know
what
their
view
is
on
wages.
so
that
any
state
law
that
specifically
deals
with
a
covered
erisa
plan...
i
mean,
congress
made
a
decision.
if
they
wanted
to
say,
look,
any
time
there's
a
conflict
workers
compensation
always
prevails
over
the
erisa
plan,
it
would
have
been
very
easy,
they
could
have
just
stuck
it
in
to
section
514(b),
but
instead
they
made
a
conscious
decision,
we're
going
to
let
workers
compensation
out
of
our
reporting
requirements,
out
of
our
fiduciary
requirements,
which
made
sense
because
workers
comp
usually
has
their
own
laws
that
regulate
those
things.
but
they
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
allow
them
to
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan,
because
to
do
that
would
then
discourage
the
employers
to
give
those
covered
benefits
to
begin
with.
and
i
think
it's...
that
result
is
unavoidable
from
the
statutory
language.
i
think
as
your
questioning
makes
clear,
the
problem
with
shaw
is
that
1)
the
shaw
statute
did
not
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan.
it
dealt
with
a
disability
law
and
it
did
not
in
any
way
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan,
so
it's
simply
not
applicable,
and
even
if
the
court
would
uphold
that
as
justice
scalia
noted,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
allows
for
any
type
of
exception,
if
you
will,
to
the
relates-to
language,
and
again,
if
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
it
could
have
put
workers
compensation
in
section
514(b),
and
it
did
not.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
they
could
do
that,
because
then
there'd
be
no
connection
to
the
covered
erisa
plan,
and
in
an
employer's
mind...
well,
first
of
all,
it
would
meet
the
statutory
language
so
therefore
it
would--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--your
honor,
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
type
of
statute
justice
wold
said
would
be
permissible,
which
is,
you
have
to
give
x
level
of
benefits,
no
mention
of
the
covered...
no
mention
of
your
health
insurance.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
and
the
state
in
its
workers
compensation
law
specifies
what
those
minimums
are.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
oh,
irrespective
of
workers
comp?
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
then
that
statute
would
be
preempted,
because
the
giving
of
those
benefits--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--irrespective
of
work
injuries,
they
cannot.
no,
you
see,
they
just
said
you
have
to
give
x
level
of
benefits.
giving
those
benefits
is
a
covered
erisa
plan
under
section
4(a)'s
definition,
so
therefore
the
law
that
required
it
would
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan
and
therefore
would
be
preempted.
now,
if
what
they
wanted
to
say
is
in
their
workers
compensation
law,
they
said
just
for
work
injuries
we're
going
to
give
x
level
of
benefits,
then
that
would
be
permissible,
because
limiting
it
to
work
injuries
would
make
it
an
exempt
plan
under
section
4(b),
and
if
they
then
didn't
tie
that
level
and
trigger
the
liability
to
a
covered
erisa
plan,
they
would
be
all
right.
in
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
i
really
don't
think
that
issue
is
really
addressed
in
our
case.
our
case
is
that
we
have
what
as
everyone
conceded...
the
health
insurance
is
a
covered
erisa
plan,
so
there's
no
question
as
to
whether
whatever
it
is
out
there
is
a
covered
erisa
plan.
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
well,
i'm
afraid
to
concede
that.
i
think
that
would
be
very
problematic
for
an
employer,
even
though
it
obviously
benefits
the
employer.
this--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--well,
i
guess
if
i
were...
if
i
had
that
case
and
i
had
to
argue
it,
what
i
would
argue
was
that
while
it
is...
your
hypothetical
is
it
specifically
relates
to
the
erisa
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
i
think
your
honor
is
correct,
that
law
would
be
struck
down,
because
the
minute
it
becomes
specific
to
the
erisa
plan,
i
think
preemption
by
this
court's
rulings
is
mandatory.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes.
i
agree,
your
honor,
as
much
as
it
hurts
to
say
so.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
this
is
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
where--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--well,
if
they
said
all
employers
had
to
give
x
level
of
benefits,
those
health
benefits
under
erisa's
definition
3(1)
and
4(a),
those
benefits
are
a
covered
erisa
plan.
in
other
words,
whether
the
employer
does
it
voluntarily,
or
the
state
mandates
it,
they
would
come
within
those
definitions.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
okay,
i
think
it's--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes.
that's
it's...
i
think
your
example,
unless
i'm
mixing
up,
is
slightly
different
than
justice
kennedy's.
your
example
is--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes,
okay.
if,
in
fact,
they
limited
that
health
benefits
solely
to
people
who
are
on
workers...
who
are
injured
workers,
then
i
would
agree
with
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
preempted.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
no.
the
minute
they
tie
the
benefits
to
the
covered
erisa
plan...
the
minute
they--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes,
but
as
this
court
held
in
alessi
section
4(b)
saves
plans,
not
laws.
your
honor
is
correct,
the
plan...
the
benefits
that
they
require
is
an
exempt
plan,
because
they
are
requiring
benefits
that
are
to
comply
with
the
worker's
compensation,
but
as
this
court
held
in
alessi,
the
mere
fact
that
the
plan
is
an
exempt
plan
doesn't
mean
the
law
that
created
it
is
saved
from
erisa
preemption.
then
you
have
to
look
at,
is
that
law...
does
that
law
in
any
way
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan,
and
by
tying
the
benefits
in
this
case
to
the
health
insurance,
that
law
then
relates
to
a
covered
erisa
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
because
the
benefits...
whatever
benefits
the
state
required,
if
they
dealt
with
health
benefits,
then
under
the
definition
of
3(1)
and
4(a),
those
benefits
that
it
requires
are
a
covered
erisa
plan.
in
other
words,
a
covered
erisa
plan
is
not
defined
as
merely
what
the
employer
voluntarily
provides.
a
covered
erisa
plan
is
simply
defined
as
certain
types
of
benefits
that
the
employer
provides,
whether
it's
voluntary
or
whether
it's
mandated.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
section
31
of
erisa
and
4(a),
which
your
honor
i
believe
is
nicely
set
out
in
the
government's
appendix.
so
that
that
definition
is
not
key
to
whether
it's
voluntary
or
not,
it
simply
says,
if
you
give
certain
benefits,
one
of
which
is
health
benefits,
and
the
employer
provides
them
and
it
affects
interstate
commerce,
then
that
is
a
covered
erisa
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes.
the
plan
itself
is
maintained
solely
for
worker's
compensation,
so
that
plan
that
the
benefits
of
law
requires
is
an
exempt
plan,
and
for
that
reason,
if
they
simply
said
we
had
to
give
10,000
dollars
a
month
for
injured
workers,
then
that
would
be
permissible,
but
the
minute
that
a--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--well,
i
think
it's...
it's
not
the
purpose,
it's
that
they
tie...
they
trigger
the
liability
and
they
tie
the
amount
of
the
liability
to
a
covered
erisa
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
but
that's
the
point.
the
law
relates
to
a
covered
erisa
plan.
the
plan
they
require
is
an
exempt
plan,
but
by
defining
what
that
exempt
plan
is,
their
definition
of
it
in
the
law
is
based
on
what
the
covered
erisa
plan
is
and
therefore
it
relates
to
a
covered
erisa
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
i
could
address
the
relates-to
aspect
of
it,
because
obviously
there
are
some
questions
on
that--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--no.
i
think
what
would
happen
is--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--well,
not...
not
really,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
district
of
columbia
makes
it
sound
as
if
this
is
a
tradition.
the
fact
is,
43
states
don't
do
what
the
district
of
columbia
does.
six
states
incorporate
the
health
benefits
and
average
with
the
wage,
and
three
states...
i
just
learned
that
rhode
island
has
a
similar
law
as
the
district
of
columbia
and
connecticut...
have
this
equivalent
benefit.
43
states
have
found
no
problem
with
not
giving
a
remedy
for
lost
health
benefits.
congress
has
similarly
in
the
longshoreman's
act
in
potomac
electric.
this
court
held
that
there
is
no
remedy
for
lost
fringe
benefits,
congress
then
amended
the
longshoreman's
act.
not
only
didn't
they
include
health
benefits,
they
explicitly
said
we
agree
with
potomac
electric
and
we
want
to
make
sure
it's
not
changed.
so
that
it's
not
a
traditional
remedy.
i
don't
think
that
affects
the
outcome
of
this
case,
whether
traditional
or
not,
but
i
think
that's
an
important
point
to
make,
and
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
most
states
realize
that,
you
know,
if
you
pay
people
enough
money
not
to
work,
they
won't
work,
and
secondly
worker's
compensation
is
a
compromise
system,
and
that
is,
employer
gives
up
all
its
defenses,
but
in
return
it
only
gives
a
limited
remedy.
every
worker's
compensation
statute
does
not
allow
anything
for
pain
and
suffering.
if
i
wanted
to
make...
if
i
wanted
to
give
a
complete
remedy,
i
would,
but
more
importantly,
congress
made
a
decision,
and
their
decision
was
that
worker's
compensations
would
not
take
precedence
over
our
protection
of
a
covered
erisa
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--what
will
happen
is
that
if
an
employee
wants
to
continue
his
health
insurance,
he
will
continue
it
for
18
months
under
cobra,
but
he
will
have
to
pay
the
premium,
and
that
also
goes
to
this
question
of
does
this
law
relate
to
a
covered
erisa
plan,
and
it
seems
to
me
our
best
argument
is
simply
plain
english,
that
to
say,
you
know,
if
you
have
a
statute
that
triggers
liability
and
bases
the
liability
on
the
covered
erisa
plan,
it
has
a
connection
with
a
reference
to,
but
congress
itself
agreed
with
that,
because
they
enacted
cobra.
cobra
is
part
of
erisa,
and
cobra
provides
for
continuation
of
health
benefits,
and
that
was
the
point
in
the
government's
amici
brief
in
support
of
us,
that
there
could
be
little
question
that
this
law
relates
to
a
covered
erisa
plan,
because
congress
clearly
showed
that
by
enacting
cobra.
the
difference
is,
congress
wanted
the
employees
to
have
to
pay
for
the
benefits,
whereas
the
district
of
columbia
would
rather
have
the
employers
pay
for
it.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
well,
your
honor,
as
we
mentioned
in
our
footnote,
and
i
believe
it
was
page
35,
footnote
7,
it's
conceivable
you
could
try
to
enact
a
general
application
statute,
so--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
amount...
it
depends
on
how
they
word
their
statute.
if
they
specifically
said--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--oh,
as
it
is
now?
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
and
could
they
then
take
that--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--if
they
single
out
worker's...
the
erisa-covered
benefits,
they
lose.
there's
no
way
they
can
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
if...
it
depends...
if
the
statute
said,
you
get
two-thirds
of
any
value
you
get
from
employer--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--but...
and
specifically
refers
to
an
eris...
health
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
i
think
then
it
would
be
preempted--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--because
it
specifically
deals
with--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
really
goes
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
mackey
that
if
you...
if
a
state
specifically
has
a
law
that
specifically
deals
with
an
erisa-covered
plan,
that's
the
end
of
the
discussion.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
a
good
law,
a
bad
law...
i
mean,
mackey
was
a
good
law
for
erisa-covered
plans.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
the
only
exception
besides
insurance
and
securities--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--i'm
afraid
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
to
the...
congress
made
a
decision,
no
state
law,
good,
bad,
indifferent,
can
relate
to...
which
is
defined
as
having
connection
with
or
a
reference
to...
a
covered
erisa
plan.
i
mean,
they
could
have
written
a
statute
that
says,
well,
you
know,
the
good
laws
we'll
allow,
the
bad
ones
we
won't,
or
if
it
has
an
effect
or
it
deals
with
administration,
but
they
chose
not
to.
your
honors--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--in
worker's
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
no.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
i
don't--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure...
well,
two
things.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yeah,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--i'm
not
sure
you're
right
in
your
assumption,
and
secondly,
it
depends
how
they
tax
it.
if
it's
a
general,
across-the-board
tax
that
says
any
value
you
get
from
employer
is
taxed,
they
don't
single
out
erisa
benefits,
then
i
think
you
end
up
with
a
general
application
statute
that
has
a
remote--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--no.
well,
i
think
if
you--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--no.
our
point
is,
if
you
single
out
the
erisa
plan
for...
covered
erisa
plan
for
special
treatment,
then
there's
preemption.
but
for
example,
in
mackey
they
had
a
garnishment
law.
obviously,
you
can't
garnish
the--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--well--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--no,
your
honor.
maybe
i
need...
obviously,
i
need
to
clarify
that.
if...
the
general...
the
statute
creating
benefits,
the
benefits
themselves
are
a
covered
erisa
plan,
so
the
state
is
saying
you
must
provide
a
covered
erisa
plan,
basically,
therefore
it's
preemptive.
if
it
was
across-the-board
tax
law,
they're
just
saying
we're
taxing
everything
in
sight,
we're
not
giving
you
any
special
treatment
pro
or
con
to
an
erisa
statute,
i
think
then
you
get
to
the
second
question,
is
the
effect
remote
or
peripheral,
and
if
the
effect
is
remote
or
peripheral
then
the
statute
stands.
but
to
the
extent
the
state
does
not
single
out
the
erisa
plan
for
any
special
treatment,
they're
okay.
now,
the
fact
is
that
they
may
swallow
it
up,
or...
you
know,
may...
or
may
once
in
a
while
touch
upon
it.
then
you
get
to
the
second
issue,
is
it
remote
or
peripheral?
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
well,
i
think
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
that
they
only
dealt
with
health
insurance
benefits.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
say
all
benefits
that
the
employer
gives...
two-thirds.
they
said,
we're
going
to
have
special
treatment
of
covered
erisa
plans,
and
so
we're
going
to
give
this
special
benefit
based
only
on
those
employers
who
give
a
covered
erisa
benefit.
it's
not
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
plan,
because
there
clearly
are
some
general
application
statutes
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
plan,
and
yet
it's
a
general
application
statute.
it
may
have
a
peripheral
remote
effect.
it's
that
they
singled
it
out
for
special
treatment.
now--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--i
would
submit
that
even
if
they
hadn't
singled
it
out,
we'd
probably
end
up
with
the
same
result,
because,
you
know,
the
health
benefits
are
so
great
a
part
of
the
package
the
employer
gives
that
if
you
simply
said,
give
two-thirds
of
all
benefits,
you
would
have
more
than
a
remote
or
a
peripheral
effect.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
your
honor,
i
think
the
definition
simply
says
certain...
these
types
of
benefits
and
then
section
3,
4(a)
then
says
if
employer
provides
these,
so--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--4(a).
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
well,
your
honor,
i
will
say
this.
it
doesn't
matter
for
our
case,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
that
health
insurance
is
a
covered
erisa
plan,
so
i
don't
think
this
court--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--sure,
your
honor,
but
in
our
case
we
already...
the
health
insurance
is
not...
the
covered
health
insurance
is
not
something
the
state
mandated,
so
in
other
words,
to
come
under
your
honor's
hypothetical,
the
state
would
not
only
have
to
first
have
the
law
they
now
want,
but
they'd
also
have
to
have
another
law
that
says
we
are
requiring
this
health
insurance.
what
they
are
relating
to
is
a
voluntary
health
benefit
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
all
right.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
my
only
point
then
would
be
that
it
doesn't
matter
for
the
disposition
of
this
case,
because
what
they
are
relating
to
is
a
voluntary
health
insurance
which
everyone
agrees
comes
under
3(1)
and
4(a).
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
health...
in
defining
the
level
of
benefits--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--yes,
they
could
enact
such
a
statute.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
because--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--because
that
plan
is
only
to
comply
with
a
worker's
compensation
law,
and
therefore
it's
under
that
plan.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
and
it's...
i
mean,
where
they
went
wrong
in
this
case
is
they
wanted
to
tie
the
benefits
to
the
covered
erisa
plan,
and
that's
the
great
mistake
of
this
case,
because
what
they
will
do
then
is
encourage
employers
not
to
provide
those
health
insurance
benefits
to
begin
with.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
oh,
that's
a
different
question.
then--
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
--no,
your
honor.
again,
if
i...
footnote
7
in
our
brief,
page
35,
deals
with
that,
and
what
i
said
there
was,
that's
a
closer
question,
because
if
could...
if
they
just
said
one-third
of
all
benefits,
now
i've
got
a
general
application
statute,
but
then
the
second
question
is,
is
the
effect
only
remote
and
peripheral,
and
i'm
not
so
sure
it
is,
and
i
would
certainly
argue,
if
i
had
that
case,
that
it
isn't,
because
unlike
a
tort
remedy,
where
a
tort
remedy
1)
is
very
infrequent,
it's
not
very
predictable,
and
2)
it's
not
the
employer
who
pays
a
tort
remedy,
it's
a
tortfeasor.
with
worker's
compensation,
i
know
i'm
going
to
have
those
work
injuries,
i
know
how
frequently
they're
going
to
occur,
and
i
pay
for
them
as
employer,
so
while
it's
a
closer
question,
i'd
still
be
prepared
to
argue
then
that
was
preempted,
but
for
a
different
reason...
not
because
it
singled
out
the
erisa
statute,
but
because
it
would
be
a
general
applications
statute,
but
then
we
get
to
the
second
part
of
the
test,
and
that
is,
is
it
remote
or
peripheral,
the
effect.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
but
i'm
not
even
sure
that's
part
of
the
test,
because
the
remote
and
peripheral,
if
you
will,
saving
clause
only
deals
with
general
application
statutes.
this
court
has
always
said
once
it's
specific,
once
they
single
out
erisa
coverage,
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
effect
is
good
and
bad.
the
good
and
bad
test
only
comes...
or
remote
peripheral
only
comes
about...
okay.
mr.
lawrence
p.
postol
thank
you,
your
honor.
