justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
it
has
to
depend
on
erisa.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
they
are
preempted
insofar
as
they
may
now
or
hereafter
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
not
to
erisa,
but
any
employee
benefit
plan
described
in
section
1003(a),
and
it
doesn't
say
relate
only
to
employee
benefit
plans
covered
by
1003(a),
which
is
the
argument
you're
making,
that
it
covers
erisa-governed
plans
but
it
also
covers
other
plans.
it
doesn't
say
relate
only
to
such
plans,
it
says
relate
to
such
plans,
and
you
must
acknowledge
that
the
benefits
here
are
measured
by
the
level
of
benefits
provided
in
the
plans,
in
erisa
plans,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
including
require
in
erisa
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
statute
says,
insofar
as
they
may
now
or
hereafter
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure,
we've
never
had
one
that's
exactly
like
this,
or
else
we
wouldn't
have
taken
this
case,
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
plan
even
though
it
sets
up
a
scheme
in
which,
when
you
increase
benefits
under
your
erisa
plan,
the
effect
will
automatically
be,
because
of
the
d.c.
law,
that
you
must
increase
benefits
under
workmen's
compensation.
i
find
it
hard
to
say
that
that
doesn't
relate
to
the
plan--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
fairly
close
and
substantial
way.
now,
maybe
it's
a
bad
idea.
maybe
the
law
shouldn't
be
written
that
way,
but
it
does
say
relate
to
any
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
ms.
murasky,
you
have
to
get
that
from
the
statute
somehow.
i
understand
your
second
argument,
but
i
thought
your
second
argument...
i
thought
the
way
you
get
there
is
that
you
tie
it
into
the
relates...
to,
and
you
say
it
doesn't
relate
to
unless
you
comply
with
this
two-step
process
rather
than
a
one-step
process,
then
you
have
some
statutory
language
you
can
hang
the
result
on,
but
once
you
give
away
the
relates-to
point,
what
other
statutory
text
can
you
possibly
rely
on
for
that
two-step
process?
it's
just
as
though
we're
going
to
sit
here
and
announce
out
of
nowhere
that
despite
what
the
statute
says
we're
going
to
impose
a
two-step
process.
we
can't
do
that...
or
we
shouldn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
need
a
two-step
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
it
does
ultimately
go
back
to
the
relates-to.
you're
saying
it
doesn't
relate
to
unless
you
comply
with
a
two-step
process.
that's
how
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
where
do
we
get
authority
to
say
that,
just
because
we
don't
like
the
result
otherwise?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
answer
is
that
congress
wanted
to
encourage
health
insurance
plans.
it
didn't
want
to
encourage
high
wages
in
particular.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
a
state
law
that
says
workmen's
compensation
award
shall
be
reduced
by
the...
there
shall
be
credited
against
the
amount
due
from
the
employer
for
workmen's
comp
the
value
of
any
health
benefits
provided
by
the
worker...
by
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
go
further
than
that.
problematic,
or
just
bad
under
your
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
it's
a
workmen's
comp
plan,
very
reasonably
says,
well,
you
know,
if
a
person
is
getting
health
benefits
that
are
of
great
value
from
the
employer,
that
should
be
credited
against
the
amount
of
workmen's
compensation
that
the
employer
has
to
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
have
to
say
that
if
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
law
relates
to
two
plans,
it
relates
to
this
plan
that
is
created
in
order
to
comply
with
the
law,
which
is
an
exempt
plan,
and
the
fact
that
it
relates
to
that
makes
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
also
relates
to
the
erisa-covered
plan
in
that
it's...
the
level
of
benefits
that
it
demands
are
key
to
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
relationship
subsists
despite
the
creation
of
the
exempt
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
say
that
they
can
do
that
so
long
as
they
only
link
it
to...
didn't
mention
health
insurance
benefits
specifically.
i
find
that
a
curious
thought.
if
they
had
just
said,
hey,
pay
to
the
disabled
employee
one-third
of
all
benefits
of
all
sorts
received
from
the
employer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
said
that
that
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
where
it's
different
from
this
case
is
that
in
this
case
you
can
say
that
it
does
affect
erisa
plans
because
an
employer
would
be
disinclined
to
increase
the
amount
of
erisa
benefits.
