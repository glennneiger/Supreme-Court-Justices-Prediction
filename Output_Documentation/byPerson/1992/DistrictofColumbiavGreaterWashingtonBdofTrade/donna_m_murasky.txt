ms.
donna
m.
murasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
state
workers
compensation
laws
were
enacted
beginning
some
80
years
ago,
an
active
employee's
compensation
consisted
principally
if
not
exclusively
of
wages
for
hours
worked.
times
have
changed.
in
recent
years,
an
increasingly
important
component
of
an
employee's
compensation
is
comprised
of
benefits
in
lieu
of
higher
wages,
including
health
insurance
benefits
for
employees
and
their
families.
in
1974,
congress
recognized
the
importance
of
nonwage
benefits
when
it
enacted
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act.
in
erisa,
congress
imposed
a
modest
level
of
regulation
on
virtually
all
employers
who
provide
nonwage
benefits
to
employees,
and
it
preempted
state
laws
relating
to
such
regulated
plans.
at
the
same
time,
however,
congress
expressly
declined
to
regulate
employers
insofar
as
they
had
benefit
plans
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
state
workers
compensation
unemployment
compensation
and
disability
insurance
laws,
and
congress
allowed
state
regulation
of
such
plans
to
continue.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
intersection
of
erisa's
preemption
and
workers
compensation
provisions.
the
case
arises
because
the
district
of
columbia
amended
its
workers
compensation
law
in
1990
to
take
into
account
modern
compensation
practices
by
providing
some
level
of
protection
to
employees
and
their
families
against
a
loss
of
health
insurance
when
employees
are
killed
or
injured
on
the
job.
the
equity
amendment
act
requires
all
employers
who
provide
health
insurance
benefits
to
their
active
workers
to
provide
equivalent
health
insurance
benefits
for
up
to
52
weeks
when
their
employees
are
eligible
to
receive
workers
compensation.
the
court
below
ruled
that
although
erisa
permits
the
states
to
require
health
insurance
as
part
of
workers
compensation,
erisa
does
not
permit
the
states
to
regulate
those
benefits
in
the
usual
workers
compensation
way
by
pegging
them
to
benefits
employees
receive
as
active
workers.
the
district
of
columbia
believes
that
this
decision
is
wrong.
it
believes
that
the
traditional
loss
replacement
method
it
has
adopted
for
determining
health
insurance
benefits
in
its
workers
compensation
law
no
more
implicates
the
concerns
of
erisa
than
with
the
freestanding
law
that
the
court
below
correctly
ruled
would
clearly
be
permissible
under
this
court's
decision
in
shaw
v.
delta
air
lines.
in
shaw,
this
court
unanimously
ruled
that
a
state
disability
insurance
benefits
law
was
not
preempted
by
erisa.
in
that
ruling,
the
court
explained
the
relates-to
language
of
the
erisa
preemption
provision
in
two
ways:
first,
the
court
said
that
relates-to
ordinarily
means
a
reference
to
or
a
benefit
or
a
connection
with
an
employee
benefit
plan.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
said
that
there
may
be
some
state
actions
that
affect
erisa-covered
plans
in
two
remote
peripheral
or
tenuous
a
way
to
warrant
a
finding
that
the
law
relates
to
the
erisa-covered
plan.
for
the
reasons
that
follow,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
equity
amendment
act
relates
to
erisa-covered
plans.
the
act
does
not
refer
to
erisa-covered
plans.
instead,
its
reference
is
employees
and
benefits.
it
applies
to
all
employers
in
the
district,
including
employers
who
are
not
subject
to
erisa
at
all.
it
does
not
regulate
the
content
or
administration
of
erisa...
covered
plans,
and
it
does
not
require
employers
to
alter
in
any
way
their
erisa-covered
plans.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
my
understanding
is
that
governments
and
churches
are
exempt
from
erisa
coverage.
all
private
employers
are
not
exempt
from
erisa.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
yes.
if
it
is
a
private
employer,
he
must--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--i
don't
believe
it
does,
i
think
for
essentially
two
reasons.
first,
let
us
assume
that
instead
of
erisa
being
passed
in
1974
and
the
equity
amendment
act
being
passed
in
1990
the
reverse
was
true,
and
for
16
years
the
board
of
trade,
for
example,
has
been
paying
health
insurance
as
workers
compensation
because
the
board
of
trade
otherwise
voluntarily
provides
the
benefits
to
his
employers.
erisa
then
is
passed,
say,
in
1990,
and
suddenly
the
board
of
trade
has
responsibilities
to
the
federal
government,
reporting,
disclosure,
and
fiduciary
responsibilities
insofar
as
his
health
insurance
benefits
for
active
workers
are
concerned.
but
i
think
this
illustrates
that
although
there
is
some
kind
of
connection,
if
you
will,
between
our
law,
because
it
governs
health
plans--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--and
erisa
because
it
also
governs
other
health
plans,
in
fact
it
really
operates
independently
of
erisa
and
is
in
no
way
dependant
on
erisa.
my
second
answer--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--they
are
measured...
the
benefits
that
our
law
requires
are
measured
by
benefits
employers
otherwise
require,
and--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--in
some
cases
i
will
agree
the--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--well,
i
think
what
you're
getting
to
is
the
meaning
of
relate
to,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
ruled...
it
certainly
hasn't
ruled
that
any
reference
to
an
erisa-covered
plan
or
any
connection
to
an
erisa-covered
plan
means
that
that
statute
is
invalid.
what
it
has
done
is
to
preempt
laws
and
only
laws
that
have
one
or
more
of
the
following
features:
that
they
regulate
the
content
of
a
plan,
the
administration
of
a
plan,
a
law
that
interferes
with
the
administration
of
a
plan
or
calculation
of
benefits
under
a
plan,
a
law
that
provides...
a
state
law
that
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
violating
erisa's
provisions
governing
employee
benefit
plans,
a
law
that
imposes
reporting
disclosure
and
fiduciary
requirement
on
erisa-covered
plans--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--well--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--i
think
the
fact
that
certain
employee
benefits
provided
to
active
workers
in
the
district
are
subject
to
erisa
doesn't
change
the
relationship
between
our
statute
and
those
benefits.
the
focus
of
our
statute
is
really
on
benefits.
whether
they're
provided
pursuant
to
erisa-covered
plans
or
whether
they're
not,
if
congress
should
decide
tomorrow,
for
example,
to
abolish
erisa
insofar
as
employee
welfare
benefits
are
concerned,
our
law
could
still
be
in
effect
and
it
would
operate
independently
of
erisa.
i
mean,
that's
part...
it
does
operate
independently
of
erisa.
its
focus
is
on
benefits.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
no,
i
think
that
ingersoll-rand
is
a
very
different
case.
in
ingersoll-rand,
this
court
emphasized
that
if
erisa
had
never
been
passed,
if
there
had
not
been
this
pension
plan
that
was
protected
by
erisa,
the
cause
of
action
would
not
have
existed,
and
in
fact
what
the
employee
was
trying
to
do
there
was
to
use
a
state
common
law
cause
of
action
to
enforce
a
federally
created
right,
i.e.,
the
right
not
to
be
terminated
by
an
employer
in
order...
so
that
an
employer
can
avoid
his
responsibilities
under
erisa.
our
law
is
different.
it
is
based
upon...
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
the
common
law
background
of
our
law.
our
law
replaces
a
common...
you
know,
a
tort
system
in
which
an
employee
who
was
injured
on
the
job,
if
he
could
prove
negligence
and
there
were
no
affirmative
defenses
available,
could
recover
as
damages--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--i'm
not
asking
you
to
overrule
that
case.
our
statute
is
not
premised
on
erisa-covered
plans.
what
it
is
premised
on
is
benefits
employers
provide
otherwise
to
their
active
employees.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
that
is
true.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
well,
it
is
measured
by
whatever
benefits
employers
provide
to
their
employers,
whether
or
not
these
employers
are
otherwise
subject
to
erisa.
but
to
go
back
to
the
workers...
the
common
law
analogy
i
was
giving
you,
i
think
this
would...
will
make
very
distinct
the
difference
between
the
common
law
action
that
our
statute
is
trying
to
replace
and
the
common
law
action
at
issue
in
ingersoll-rand.
let's
look
at
a
state
such
as
texas,
in
which
workers
compensation
is
not
mandatory
and
employers
may
opt
out
of
the
workers
compensation
system
but
they're
otherwise
subject
to
the
common
law
tort
remedies.
everybody
who
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
agrees
that
in
a
case
in
which
the
employer
is
subject
to
the
common
law
that
workers
compensation
basically
replaces,
that
worker
may
require,
if
he's
injured
on
the
job,
not
only
his
wages
but
all
lost
benefits,
including
health
insurance
benefits.
everybody
agrees
upon
that.
our
statute,
what
it
does,
i
think,
is
to
make
liability
attach
when
there
is
a
work-related
injury.
remedy
is
measured
separately,
but
just
as
in
the
common
law
workers
compensation
law
liability
attaches
if
there's
negligence,
here
it
simply
attaches
if
there's
a
work...
related
injury.
we're
just
measuring
a
remedy
here.
now,
if
i
could
follow
up,
there
was
a
recent
district
court
decision,
i
think,
that
may
help
to
answer
your
question
and
also
illustrate
some
of
the
problems
that
the
states
are
facing
in
this
area.
this
is
a
case
from
texas...
i
think
it's
called
urene
against
wyatt
cafeterias...
in
which
you
had
an
employer
who
opted
out
of
the
workers
compensation
plan...
workers
compensation
law.
the
law
did
impose
some
requirements
on
employers
who
opted
out.
an
employee
of
wyatt
had
a
slip
and
fall
and
was
injured.
she
brought
a
negligence
action
against
wyatt
cafeterias
and
the
court...
the
employer
argued
that
the
common
law
cause
of
action
was
preempted
by
erisa
because
the
employer
had
included
in
its
erisa-covered
plan
a
provision
that
governed
job-related
injuries.
the
trial
court
in
that
case
first
concluded
that
this
little
erisa
plan
in
effect
preempted...
preempted
the
workers
compensation
alternative.
on
reconsideration,
what
the
court
did
was
to
say,
look,
this
is...
you
know,
since
the
employer
has
opted
out
of
the
workers
compensation
system,
this
case
is
no
different
from
an
ordinary
tort
case
and
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
tried
to,
i
guess,
evade
its
responsibilities
under
workers
compensation
law
by
passing
this
modest
provision
in
its
erisa-covered
plan
isn't
enough
to
take
it...
you
know,
the
state
law
still
applies.
what
the
court
did
on
i-consideration
also
was
to
say
that
the
plan
benefits
could
be
considered,
but
only
as
an
offset
to
the
damages
remedies,
but
that
employers
cannot
set
up
grounds
for
the
purpose
of
evading
lawful
state
requirements.
but
to
go
back
to
what
i
was
saying,
the
court
has
never
held
a
law
like
this
one
preempted,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
should
not
attribute
to
congress,
when
everyone
i
think
concedes
except
for
the
united
states...
attribute
to
congress
an
intention
of
permitting
employers
to
require
health
benefit...
permitting
employers
to
require
health
benefits
as
part
of
workers
compensation
but
then
saying
that
the
only
way
you
can
do
it
is
in
a
way
that
is
administratively
difficult
and
that
doesn't
comport
with
traditional
workers
compensation
principles,
and
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
has
held
here.
unless
there's
further
questions,
i'll--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--let
me
say
two
things.
the
board
of
trade's
plan,
health
insurance
plan
for
active
workers,
is
an
erisa-covered
plan.
however,
the
benefits
that
we
require
pursuant
to
workers
compensation
can
be
provided
through
a
separate
plan
solely
for
that
purpose.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
here
we--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--yes,
i
think
we
do
have
an
exempt
plan...
the
workers
compensation
plan
that
the
employer
sets
up.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
well,
i
think
health
insurance
coverage
can
be
required,
either
pursuant
to...
well,
health
insurance
coverage
may
be
part
of
either
erisa...
covered
plans
or
erisa-exempt
plans.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
no,
i
think
that
our...
the
workers
compensation
law
here--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--the
employer's
plan
here...
as
far
as
i
know,
the
employer's
plan
here
simply
provided
benefits
to
active
workers.
that
plan
was...
is
subject
to
erisa's--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--that
is
not
an
exempt
plan,
as
far
as
i
know.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
no,
i
don't.
as
you
know,
we--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--okay.
we
have
made
two
alternative
arguments.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
the
employer's
underlying
plan
as
far
as
i
know
is
covered
by
erisa.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
the
board
of
trade
is
not--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--well,
we
have
made
two
arguments.
the
first
is
based
on
the
r.
r.
donnelley
case
and
its
interpretation
of
shaw,
and
on
this
court's
description
of
shaw
in
metropolitan
life,
and
there
the
court
seemed
to
say
that
when
we
have
a
workers
compensation
statute
at
issue,
we
have
a
two-step
approach.
the
first
step
is
whether
it
relates
to
erisa-covered
plans,
and
if
so,
whether
it
is
a...
whether
an
employer
can
comply
with
the
state
law
by
maintaining
a
plan
solely
for
that
purpose,
and
here--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--mm-hmm.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
i'm
not
certain
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
the
same
plan.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
well,
what
i
would
say
is
two
things--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--i
don't,
in
part
because
it
seemed
to
me...
well,
the
second
circuit
has
interpreted
shaw
as
saying,
even
though
it
relates
to
an
erisa-covered
plan,
if
you
have
a
workers
compensation
law
the
law
treats
that
differently,
and
if
an
employer
can
comply...
comply
with
a
state
law
by
making
a
separate
plan
solely
for
that
purpose,
that
state
law
is
not
preempted.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
well,
i
think
that
certainly
this
court
in
metropolitan
life
described
the
disability
benefits
law
in
shaw
as
one
that
related
to
erisa-covered
plans,
and
this
court
just
as
clearly
in
shaw
said
that
that
statute
was
not
preempted.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
in
a
two-step
process.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
well,
the
way
i
understood
it
was,
even
if
it
relates
to,
and
there...
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
you
can
maintain
a
plan
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
the
law,
and
that
would
distinguish
shaw.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
well,
i
think
the
court
said
it
in
metropolitan
life
and
shaw.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
shaw
certainly
was,
and
metropolitan
life
was
an
insurance
case.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
that
some...
some
statutes.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
some
statutes
that
relate
to
erisa-covered
plans
are
nevertheless
exempt.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
that
i
think
would
cover
the
saving
clause
things--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--and
if
you
interpret
shaw
in
the
way
that
the
second
circuit
did,
that's
also
true,
but
i
think
that
maybe
the
critical
thing
here
is
to...
you
have
to
look
at
the
words
relate
to,
and
it
can't
mean
every
reference
and
every
connection
to
erisa-covered
plans.
for
example,
state
income
tax
laws...
well,
erisa
benefit
plans
play
a
huge
role
in
our
society
now.
they
have
economic
consequences
that
congress
must
deal
with
in
laws
other
than
erisa.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
mm-hmm.
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
it
would
have
to
be
keyed
to
benefits,
but
let
me--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--i
think
that
that's
construing
relates-to
too
broadly,
and
let
me
just
address
the
concept
of
plan
for
a
second.
it
seems
to
me
that
plan
in
the
case
of
an
erisa-covered
plan
is
a
plan
that
complies
with...
it's
a
document,
and
it's
a
plan
that
sets
forth
the
benefits
that
are
being
provided
to
your
active
workers,
it
complies
with
whatever
regulations
erisa
imposes
on
that
plan,
you
send
it
to
the
department
of
labor,
and
that's...
that's
that
erisa-covered
plan.
in
the
employer's
workers
compensation
plan
you
have
a
separate
document
in
which
you
set
forth
the
benefits
that
are
required
by
a
workers
compensation
law,
and
that
plan
must
be
subject
to
the,
you
know,
reporting
and
disclosure
requirements
of
the
state
law,
but
they're
too
separate
documents,
and
the
fact
that
the
benefits
in
the
erisa-covered
document
may
be
the
same
as
the
benefits
in
the
workers
compensation
document
doesn't
constitute
a
sufficient
relationship
to.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
equity
amendment
act
does
not
single
out
erisa-covered
plans
for
special
treatment.
it
treats
erisa-exempt
and
erisa-covered
plans
in
the
same
fashion,
and
in
this
respect
it
does
differ
from
the
statute
that
this
court
considered
in
mackey,
or
the
exemption
to
the
garnishment
statute.
the
only
place
in
which
our
worker's
compensation
law
does
mention
erisa-covered
plans
is
of
course
in
the
provision
of
our
law
that
permits
worker's
compensation
benefits
to
be
integrated
with
benefits
provided
under
erisa-covered
plans,
and
that
statute
is
cited
at
page
9,
note
9
of
our
reply
brief.
no
one
has
suggested
that
this
aspect
of
the
statute,
which
does
specifically
refer
to
erisa-covered
plans,
is
preempted
by
erisa.
2.
i
think
in
this
case
the
board
of
trade
is
using
erisa
as
a
sword
to
invalidate
valid
worker's
compensation
laws
and
not
as
a
shield.
if
we
were
to
abolish
our
worker's
compensation
system
and
allow
employers
to
be
sued
based
on
a
showing
simply
of
negligence,
and
we
could
even
eliminate
the
affirmative
defenses
that
an
employer
otherwise
would
have,
all
employees
who
could...
who
were
injured
on
the
job
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
who
could
establish
negligence,
or
i
suppose
we
could
even
employee
a
standard
of
strict
liability,
each
one
of
those
employees
could
recover
as
part
of
his
damages
not
only
wages
lost
and
the
cost
of
treating
the
injury
or
illness,
but
the
value
of
health
benefits
lost.
our
worker's
compensation
merely
reflects
that.
it
imposes
liability
when
there's
a
work-related
injury,
and
the
remedy
is
measured
by
what
an
employee
otherwise
receives.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to...
two
other
points.
there's
some
suggestion
here
that
somehow
our
law
is
invalid,
our
amendment
is
invalid
because
it's
somewhat
innovative.
the
court
rejected
a
similar
argument
not
only
in
metropolitan
life
but
in
the
1988
case
of
goodyear
atomic
corporation
against
miller.
that
case
is
also
interesting
because
it
involves
a
worker's
compensation
law
and
an
unusual
one
that
was
applied
to
the
united
states
itself
pursuant
to
a
congressional
enactment.
i
think
that
case
establishes
two
things:
congress'
great
deference
to
the
states
in
managing
their
own
worker's
compensation
plans,
and
that
innovative
worker's
compensation
laws
are
not
prohibited.
finally,
if
i
could
just
mention
cobra
for
a
moment,
the
united
states
has
argued
that
cobra
affects
this
court's
analysis
in
two
ways.
one
is
on
the
relates...
to
point.
it
says
that
because
cobra
affects
erisa-covered
plans
by
this
continuation
of
coverage--
ms.
donna
m.
murasky
--you're
welcome,
your
honor.
