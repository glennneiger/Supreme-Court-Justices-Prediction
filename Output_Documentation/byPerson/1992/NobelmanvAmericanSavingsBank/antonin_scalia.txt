justice
scalia
mr.
palmer,
would
you
explain...
explain
how
your
system
works?
how
can
it
be
that
where
you
have
a
single
instrument
of
indebtedness
that
covers
both
the
secured
and
the
unsecured
claim,
you
can
comply
with
what
you
contend
the
provision
says,
and
that
is
allow
the
instrument
to
be
modified
as
to
the
unsecured
claim,
but
not
allow
it
to
be
modified
as
to
the
secured
claim.
how
does
one
go
about
doing
that?
justice
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
i
mean,
i'm
not
asking
for
the
difference
between
the
secured
and
the
unsecured;
i
understand
that.
but
for
the
car
or
for
the
homestead,
i
have
the
same
problem
about
how
you
can...
how
you
can
allow
a
unitary
instrument
which
covers
a
claim...
part
of
which
is
secured
and
part
of
which
is
unsecured,
but
it's
just
one
instrument.
how
can
you
allow
it
to
be
modified
as
to
the
secured
portion
of
the
claim
but
not
as
to
the
unsecured
portion
of
the
claim,
or
vice
versa,
which
is
what
1322(b)(2)
requires?
how
can
you
do
that?
it's
a
single
instrument
that
covers
both.
justice
scalia
well,
i
understand
that.
but
the
other
side
says
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
this
problem.
given
our
interpretation,
you
simply...
you
simply
can't
modify
it,
if
it's
a
homestead.
you
say,
yes,
you
can,
but
you
can
only
modify
it...
you
can
only
modify
it
as
to
the
unsecured.
how
does
one
go
about
modifying
it
just
as
to
the
unsecured?
justice
scalia
well,
but
we're
not
talking
about
the
revesting
provision.
what
we're
talking
about
is
whether
the
rights
can
be
modified
in
the
plan.
that's
the
provision
we're
discussing
here.
now,
give
me
an
example
of
how
one
can
modify
the
rights
pertaining
to
this
unitary
instrument
only
as
to
the
unsecured
portion,
but
not
as
to
the
secured
portion.
how
does
one
go
about
doing
that?
justice
scalia
no,
but
the
provision
we're
talking
about
is
a
provision
that
allows
rights
to
be
modified,
right?
i
mean
that's
the
provision
before
us.
justice
scalia
and...
right.
and
as
at
issue
is
whether
the
exception
to
that
which
says
you
can't
modify
rights
as
to
homestead...
whether
that
covers
all
rights
in
the
homestead
agreement
or
only
those
rights
that
are
secured.
and
you
say
the
latter,
right?
justice
scalia
and
just
give
me
an
example
of
a
real
life
mortgage
agreement
in
which
you
modify
the
unsecured
portion
but
not
the
secured
portion.
how...
i
really
don't
understand
what
it
means
to
say
that.
justice
scalia
well,
i
do
things
that
way,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
care
if
there's
a
case
or
not.
but
if
it's
impossible
to
do,
if
you
can't
give
me
an
example
of
how
it
might
be
done,
i
will
be
inclined
to
think
that
your
reading
of
the
provision
is
wrong
since
it
makes
no
sense.
just
tell
me
how?
you
know,
how
one
would
do
it
if
one
wanted
to
do
it?
justice
scalia
mr....
is
this
another
point
or
are
you
still
responding
to
the
same
one?
justice
scalia
before
you
do
that,
let's
take
a...
i'm
not
satisfied
or
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
my
previous
question.
suppose
you
have
a
mortgage
that
provides
for
payments
of
$500
a
month,
all
right.
and
that's
for
the
whole
thing,
for
the
secured
and
the
unsecured.
how
do
you
modify
the
unsecured
portion
of
that
mortgage
without
modifying
the
secured
portion?
don't
the
payments
still
have
to
be
$500
a
month?
justice
scalia
well
i...
i'm
surprised
this
is
even
an
issue.
i
mean
the
provision
doesn't
mean
very
much
if
it
means
the
only
rights
you
may
modify
are
the
lien
rights
in
particular.
i
mean
surely
it
means
you
can...
you
can
modify
the
rights
that
are
the
substantive
rights
to
which
the
lien
attaches.
the
right
to
payment
by
a
certain
date,
the
right
to
a
certain
amount
of
payments
every
month,
and
so
forth
and
so
forth.
justice
scalia
certainly
everybody
understands
that's
what
it
means.
justice
scalia
and
those
are
state
rights,
aren't
they?
justice
scalia
so
why
isn't
your
answer
to
justice
white
simply
yes,
it
includes
state
rights?
justice
scalia
rights
means
the
rights
to
which
the
lien
that's
a
lien
on
a
homestead
relates.
justice
scalia
okay.
no,
but
you're...
but
you're
also
identifying
the
person
who
can
claim
anything
as
the
person
whose
sole
lien
is...
whose
lien
is
solely
on
the
homestead
property.
justice
scalia
and
that
alone.
justice
scalia
to
be
fair,
it
refers...
it
refers
not
just
to
a
claim,
but
to
a
claim
secured,
which
is
poetic
for
secured
claim.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
schroeder,
what...
what
if
you
have
two
mortgages
on
a
property,
okay?
justice
scalia
and
even
the
first
one
is
undersecured.
under
your
reading,
is
the
second
mortgage
also
protected?
justice
scalia
even
though
that
second
mortgage
doesn't
even
qualify
as
a
secured
claim
at
all.
it's
not
even
a...
under
506.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
secured.
now,
don't
say
"may
not"
now.
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
it
is
not.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
a
secured
claim
under
506(a).
justice
scalia
but
under
your
reading
it
would
have
full
protection
under...
as
a
second
mortgage
even
though
the
first
mortgage
gobbles
up
the
entire
value
of
the
security,
right?
justice
scalia
wow.
justice
scalia
well,
they--
justice
scalia
mr.
schroeder,
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
interests
of
your
clients
to
protect
the
second
mortgage
as
well
as
the
first
mortgage.
but,
in
fact,
i
can
agree
with
you
on
the
first
mortgage
here
without
agreeing
with
you
on
the
second.
justice
scalia
i
can
read
the
word...
as
justice
kennedy
said,
the
word,
the
phrase
506(a).
justice
scalia
you
would
rather...
you
would
want
us
to
go
further,
but
we
really
don't
have
to
to
agree
with
you
on
the
first
mortgage.
justice
scalia
yes.
