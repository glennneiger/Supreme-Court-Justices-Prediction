justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
to
get
one
thing
clear
in
my
mind.
you
do...
or
what
is
your
position
on
whether
the
interference
with
your
right,
otherwise
existing
right
to
foreclose,
would
be
a
modification
of
your
rights?
justice
stevens
so
this
is
done
by
statute
rather
than
by
a
plan.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
that
is
not
a
modification
caused
by
the
plan.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understood
one
of
your
answers
to
justice
scalia.
assume
the
hypothetical,
the
second
mortgage
in
this
case
in
which
the
first
mortgage
is
undersecured,
is
the
person
who
holds
the
second
mortgage...
does
he
have
a
secured
or
an
unsecured
claim?
