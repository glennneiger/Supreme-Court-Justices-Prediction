justice
o'connor
mr.
palmer,
i'm
not
sure
that
1332(b)(2)
refers
to
secured
claim.
it...
the
language
is
"a
claim
secured
only
by
a
security
interest.
"
i'm
not
sure
that
necessarily
means
the
same
thing.
justice
o'connor
it's
an
identification
of
the
instance
in
which
the...
where
there
is
a
security
interest
in
real
property
that
is
the
principal
residence,
it
says
no
modification
of
the
rights
of
holders
could
be
made.
and
i
think
you
also
have
to
deal
with
the
language,
modify
the
rights
of
holders.
i
suppose
a
holder
can
hold
both
rights
to
secured
and
unsecured
claims.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
dangerous
business,
i
suppose.
[laughter]
justice
o'connor
counsel,
what
can
the
debtor
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding
do,
then,
in
a
situation
such
as
the
nobelmans
have?
just
leave
the
residence
out
of
the
proceeding
altogether
and
let
it
be
taken
by
the
mortgage
holders.
justice
o'connor
well,
and
in
your
position,
pay
off
the
whole
principal
balance
even
though
the
property
isn't
worth
it
at
all.
justice
o'connor
so
does
he
have
another
alternative,
just
walk
away
from
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
he
wants
to
walk
away
from
it,
would
he
have
to
do
it
in
a
chapter
7
proceeding,
very
likely?
justice
o'connor
now,
a
majority
of
the
circuits
have
gone
the
other
way.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you...
how
do
you
explain
that?
they
just
take
your...
the
petitioners'
view
of
this
thing,
i
guess,
in
terms
of
how
to
read
the
statute.
