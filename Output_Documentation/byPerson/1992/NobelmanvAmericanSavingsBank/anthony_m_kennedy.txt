justice

under
your
view,
what
is
the
result
if
there
is
a
second
mortgage
as
to
which
there
is
no
adequate
security
at
all?
say
that
in
this
case
there
were
a
second
mortgage,
even
the
first
is
not
satisfied.
is
the
second
mortgagee
a
holder
of
a
secured
claim?
justice
kennedy
even
though
the
value
of
the
property
does
not
support
any
portion
of
his
secured...
any
portion
of
his
claim
as
a
secured
claim.
justice
kennedy
it's
difficult
for
me
to
square
that
with
506(a).
i
know
we're
not
talking
about
a
second
here,
but
i
want
to
see
how
the
statute
works.
justice
kennedy
all
right,
but
then
go
to
506.
under
506(a),
is
he
a
secured
creditor?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
circular,
because
of...
(b)(2)
does
not
apply
except
to
the
holders
of
secured
claims.
and
under
506(a),
he's
not
secured
in
any
degree.
so
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
plausible--
justice
kennedy
--to
read
(b)(2)
as
applying
to
someone
who
has
a...
a
holder
who
has
some
portion
of
his
claim
secured.
justice
kennedy
but
in
the
situations...
the
cases
supposed
and
put
to
you
by
justice
stevens
and
justice
scalia
and
earlier
by
me,
that
is
not
the
case
with
the
second
mortgagee.
