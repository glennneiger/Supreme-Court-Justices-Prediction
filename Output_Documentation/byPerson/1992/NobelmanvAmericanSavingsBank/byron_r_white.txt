justice
white
you
mean
your
clients
weren't
trying
to
alter
a
secured
claim.
justice
white
under
chapter
7.
justice
white
does
the...
in
13
does...
if
the
secured
creditor
wants
to
participate,
does
he
have
to
file
a
claim?
justice
white
yeah.
did--
justice
white
--under
506...
under
506
does
a
secured
creditor...
with
506
in
mind,
does
he
just
file
a
claim
for
the
full
amount
of
his
security?
justice
white
and
he
never
then
files
a
claim
for
the
unsecured
portion.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
the
secured
creditor
has
filed
a
claim
for
the
full
amount.
justice
white
as
a
secured
creditor...
as
a
secured
claim.
justice
white
and
so
he
has
an...
so
the
secured
creditor,
whether
it's
a...
whether
it's
a
homestead
or
not,
he
has
a...
he
has
a
chance
to
litigate
the
value
that
they
assign.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
"other
than
the
holder
of
a
claim
secured
only
by
a
security
interest.
"
justice
white
yes,
uh-huh,
all
right.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
would...
the
meaning
he
would
ascribe
to
1322(b)(2)
would
be
the
same
if
it
just
read
"the
plan
may
modify
secured
claims
other
than
a
claim
secured
by.
"
which
the
meaning
for
him,
the
meaning
wouldn't
change
if
you
left
out
the
words
"the
rights
of
holders
of".
is
that
right?
justice
white
and
but
you...
but
rights
you
figure
are
those
rights
defined
by
state
law.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
have
to
get
to
it
because
otherwise
you
can
say...
you
could
argue
that
well
the
rights
are
those
that
are...
that
are
described
in
506.
namely,
you've
got
a
secured
claim
only
to
the
extent
of
the
value
of
the
property.
justice
white
so
it's
state
law
rights,
i
guess.
justice
white
how
about
not...
but
limited
to.
under
1322,
you're
talking...
the
word
"rights"
refers
only
to
the
rights
of
the
holder
that
he
acquired
prior
to
bankruptcy
under
state
law.
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
yeah,
but
he's
got
to
keep...
he's
not
only
got
to
make
up
arrearages;
he's
got
to
pay
his
current
amounts
due.
justice
white
so
your
submission
is
that
a
plan
may
not
be
confirmed
unless
it
provides
for
the
payment
of
the
entire
principal
amount.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
and
no
part
of
it
can
be
treated
as
an
unsecured
claim.
what
may--
justice
white
--how
may
the
rights
of
unsecured
creditors
be
modified
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding?
justice
white
uh-hum.
justice
white
do
they
have
to
pay
them
at
all?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
sure.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
how
about
secured
creditors?
justice
white
well,
how
about
the...
how
about
the
principal
amount,
the
unpaid
principal
amount?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
right.
but
now
the
rest
of
the
unpaid
amount.
justice
white
the
rest
of
it,
yeah.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
but
when...
when
the...
suppose
the
disposal
income
is
not
enough
to
pay
anything
more
than,
say...
it
just
obviously
isn't
enough
ever
to
pay
off
unsecured
claims,
all
of
them.
justice
white
yes.
and
so
the
balance
is...
when
he
pays
what
he
can,
he's
discharged
from--
justice
white
--but
in
any
event,
the
principal
amount,
the
unpaid
principal
amount
of
the
contract
or
on
the
mortgage
on
the
principal
residence
just
lingers.
he's
never
discharged
from
that,
in
your
position.
justice
white
--i
would
think
under
your
position
in
this
case,
it
would
be
better
for
the...
for
the
homeowner
just
to
say
go
ahead
and
foreclose,
just
abandon
the
property
to
you.
justice
white
and
then...
and
what
rights
would
you
have,
then,
by
the
way?
would...
say
you
foreclose.
would
you
have
any
security
claim
that
you
might
have
to...
that
you
could
get
paid
off
or
possibly
get
paid
off
under
the
plan?
justice
white
yeah,
yeah.
justice
white
but
you'll
still
have
a
deficiency.
justice
white
and
that
is
still...
except
for
the
bankruptcy,
he
would
still
owe
it.
justice
white
well
he
still
owe
it
to
you
if
he
abandons
the
property
to
you?
justice
white
wouldn't
it
be--
justice
white
--but
i
would
have
thought
that
your
deficiency
would
be
discharged
in
the...
in
the
proceeding.
justice
white
well,
it
may
not
be,
but
it's
kind
of
an
interesting
question,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
white
1328.
justice
white
well
say
it
was...
it
didn't
exceed
the
length
of
time
that...
say
it
would...
it
didn't
exceed
that
length
of
time,
would
it
be
discharged?
justice
white
because
why?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
why
in
the
first
place
would
be...
would
it
be
discharged?
did
you...
would
you
have
filed
a
deficiency?
filed--
justice
white
--your
client...
your
client
would
have...
would
have
scheduled
it.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
and
that
would
be
discharged.
justice
white
yeah.
