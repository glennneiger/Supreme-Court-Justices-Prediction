mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
palmer
was
correct
when
he
said
that
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
one
or
more
statutes.
i
would
like
to
reread
section
1322
for
the
court,
the
pertinent
portions
of
that
statute,
and
if
the
court
wants
to
follow
along,
that
statute
is
reprinted
in
page
3
of
american
savings'
brief.
the
pertinent
provisions
of
1322(b)(2)
state
that
"the
plan
may
modify
the
rights
of
holders
of
secured
claims,
other
than
a
claim
secured
only
by
security
interest
in
real
property
that
is
the
debtor's
principal
resident.
"
taking
a
plain
and
clear
look
at
the
language
of
this
statute,
it
appears
that
the
word
"rights"
is
the
grammatical
object
of
the
word
"modify".
modify.
what
are
modifying?
we're
modifying
the
rights.
in
addition,
the
term
"secured
claim",
again
in
that
first
phrase,
is
preceded
by
the
preposition
"of".
it's
our
contention
that
those
three
words
together,
"of
secured
claim"
is
merely
definitional
and
defines
the
type
of
holder
that
the
congress
was
talking
about
when
they
passed
the
statute.
they're
talking
about
a
holder
of
a
secured
claim.
now,
applying
mr.
palmer's
rule--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
and
applying
mr.
palmer's
rule
of
last
antecedent,
several
courts
which
have
allowed
lien
strip-down
have
simply
gone
back
and
applied
the
"other
than"
words
simply
to
the
phrase
"secured
claim".
it's
our
position
that
the
better
application,
according
to
that
particular
rule,
is
to
apply
the
"other
than"
phrase
to
the
rights
of
holders
of
secured
claims.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
so
long
as
he
had
a
perfected
security
interest
in
the
property
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
bankruptcy,
he
would
be
a
secured
creditor,
that's
correct.
the
debtor--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that's
correct.
he
would
be
a
secured
creditor.
however,
his
security
interests
would
be
undersecured.
in
your
example,
there
would
be
no
value
in
the
property
to
support
his
security
interest.
nonetheless,
because
he
has,
for
example,
a
second
lien
mortgage
or
deed
of
trust,
he
would
ostensibly
be
classified
as
a
secured
creditor
because
he
has
a
security
interest
claim
against
property
of
the
debtor
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
and
until
the
legislature
clarifies
your
concern,
it's
our
interpretation
that
the
same
treatment
must
be
accorded
to
a
first,
second,
or
third
lienholder
against
residential
real
property,
without
regard
to
the
value
of
the
property.
and
let
me,
if
i
can,
explain
how
i
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
mr.
palmer's
client
would
have
this
court
believe
that
506(a)
automatically
kicks
in
to
affect
the
claim
or
secured
claim
rights
of
a
holder
as
defined
in
section
1322.
it's
our
position
that
506(a)
doesn't
necessarily
automatically
kick
in
to
define
the
term
"secured
claim"
in
that
instance.
the
term
"secured
claim"
is
merely
definitional,
again,
of
the
type
of
holder
that
the
statute's
talking
about.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
i
think
for
mr.
palmer's
position
that
would
be
correct.
but
what
the...
the
way...
the
statute's
not
written
that
way.
the
statute
is
written
that
it's
the
rights
that
are
protected
by
the
"other
than"
clause,
in
a
clause
that
fits
after
the
comma.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's...
i'll
get
into
that
argument--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--well,
we
would
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
the
term
"rights",
as
opposed
to
the
words
"claim",
and
"security
interest"
and
"lien"
and
other
words
of
art
in
the
bankruptcy
code...
the
word
"rights"
is
not
defined
anywhere
in
the
bankruptcy
code
itself.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
well,
this...
this
court,
in
dewsnup,
gave
us
some
direction
as
to
some
of
the
rights
that
a
holder
of
a
mortgage
has,
with
respect
to
its
note
and
deed
of
trust,
a
mortgage.
and
it
comes
into
the
bankruptcy
court
as
a
creditor
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
this
court,
for
example,
in
dewsnup
has
said
that
it
is
the
creditor,
not
the
debtor,
who
has
the
benefit
of
increase
in
value,
so
as
to
avoid
a
windfall
to
the
debtor
in
that
case.
i
believe
that's
one
right.
another
right
that
the
dewsnup
court
set
forth
was
the
right
to
have
the
lien
pass
through
bankruptcy
unaffected.
in
addition,
this
court
in
the
barnhill
case,
in
interpreting
the
words
property
and
interest
in
property,
said
that
in
the
absence
of
a
controlling
federal
law,
we
may
look
to
state
laws.
so
by
analogy,
i
think...
to
answer
your
question...
yes,
we
may
look
to
state
law
in
determining
what
rights
are.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
and
that's
exactly--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--and
that's
exactly--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
yes,
it
does
include
state
rights.
[laughter]
but
what--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--yes.
because
i
think
the
rights
that
any
creditor
would
have
in
bankruptcy
are
those
defined
by
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
so,
yes.
and
justice
scalia,
your
analysis
is
exactly
our
point.
the
"other
than"
clause
must
affect
all
those
rights,
those
bundle
of
rights
that
a
secured
creditor
such
as
my
client
would
take
with
him
in
the
bankruptcy.
in
addition--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
if
it's
not
homestead,
for
example.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
if
that's--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that
would
be
our
interpretation,
yes.
because--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
and
that's...
yes,
sir.
and
that's
because
that's...
in
our
view,
that's
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
the
"other
than"
clause
refers
to
those
creditors
having
a
claim
on
real
property
that
is
the
debtor's
principal
residence.
so
it's
under
that--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--and
that...
under
that
statute
alone,
that
seems
where
that
protection
is
directed,
that's
correct.
in
addition,
under
that
second
clause,
the
1322(b)(2)
refers
to
a
claim
in
the
singular.
it
does
not
refer
a
second
time
to
secured
claim
or
to
secured
portion
of
a
claim,
or
something
else;
it
refers
to
a
claim.
and
under
section
101(5)(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
"claim"
is
defined
as
any
right
to
payment,
whether
or
not
such
right
is
secured
or
unsecured.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
some
courts
have
interpreted
it
that
way,
yes,
your
honor.
other
commentators
have
found
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
term
506(a)
and
"claim
secured
by",
where
the
word
"secured"
is
definitional.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
what
i
was
told
when
i
got
my
certificate
from
this
court.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
they
have
several
elections
or
alternatives,
and
some
of
the
alternatives
are
not
very
realistic.
one
alternative
would
be
to
cure
any
existing
arrearage
immediately
so
there
is
no
problem
with
the
mortgage
company.
most
debtors
wouldn't
be
in
bankruptcy
in
the
first
place
if
they
had
that
ability
to
do
that.
another
alternative
would
be...
and
this
is
what
i
believe
the
legislature
intended
and
senator
deconcini's
comments
went
to,
is
that
a
claim
such
as
the
one
claimed
by
american
savings
bank,
the
debtor
would
elect
to
cure
and
maintain
payments
under
section
1322(b)(5).
under
1322(b)(5),
a
homestead
debtor
typically
takes
a
prepetition
arrearage,
that
arrearage
that
existed
on
the
mortgage
loan
prior
to
bankruptcy,
puts
it
into
his
plan,
and,
depending
on
what
district
you're
in,
either
makes
direct
regular
monthly
postpetition
payments
to
the
creditor
or
through
the
trustee
to
the
creditor.
that's
an
election
that
a
creditor
in
the
nobelmans'
position
could
take.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
and
that's
the
way
the
code's
read.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
well--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--he
can
walk
away
from
it.
he
can
go
into
a
chapter
7
and
get
his
personal
liability
discharged,
which
is
going
to
get
him
potentially
better
off
than
if
he
were
to
go
through
a
chapter
13.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
if
he
wants
to
avoid
personal
liability,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
chapter
13,
the
discharge
provision,
section
1328,
has
an
exception.
there
are
certain
debts
which
are
excepted
to
discharge
in
chapter
13
which
are
not
excepted
to
in
chapter
7.
for...
and
one
of
those
is
long-term
debt,
where
the
last
payment
on
the
debt
is
on
a
date
further
into
the
future
than
the
last
payment
date
on
the
chapter
13
case.
so
potentially
in
the
situation
we're
talking
about,
a
debtor
may
be
better
off
going
into
a
7
because
he
would
have
the
receipt
of
a
chapter
7
discharge,
would
receive
that
personal
liability
relief.
but
obviously
he
would
lose
his
home.
the
creditor,
more
than
likely,
would
ask
the
court
to
lift
the
stay
or
modify
the
stay
to
allow
foreclosure
to
proceed.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
well,
if
i
might
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
by
addressing
the
four
specific
cases
individually.
in
the
hougland
case
which
came
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
was
the
first
of
the
pro
lien-stripping
cases,
it
appears
from
a
reading
of
the
text
that
that
court
was
predisposed
as
to
its
decision.
there
was
some
verbiage
in
that
decision
which
says
we
can't
believe
that
a
mortgage
creditor
wouldn't
have
an
equity
cushion
in
the
first
place.
they
also
do,
as
my
opponent
is
suggesting,
automatically
take
506(a)
and
force
it
into
1322(b)(2),
just
because
506...
the
chapter
5
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
are
ones
of
general
applicability
to
all
other
substantive
provisions.
the
wilson
case
is
somewhat
distinguishable.
the
same
result
was
reached
there,
but
in
that
case
the
creditor
had
additional
collateral
beyond
the
homestead.
and
so
the
court,
in
part...
almost
in
passing,
but
it
did
recognize
that
additional
collateral
beyond
the
homestead
was
claimed
by
the
mortgage
company
in
that
case,
so
that
case
is
somewhat
distinguishable.
in
the
hart
case
we
have
the
same
situation
where
we
had
a
mobile
home
on
real
property
and
other
collateral.
again,
that
is
somewhat
distinguishable.
that's
not
what
the
court
necessarily...
the
facts
that
that
court
necessarily
relied
on
in
reaching
its
decision,
but
those
were
considered
by
that
court
in
the
result
that
took
place.
in
the
most
recent
case,
the
bellamy
case,
the
court
there
takes
a
somewhat
circular
analysis
of
the
statutes
in
effect.
the
court,
by
that
time,
had
heard
several
arguments.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
creditor
involved
in
that
case,
the
federal
home
mortgage
corporation,
made
the
argument
that
it
was
rights
and
not
the
secured
claim
that
was
subject
to
modification
at
1322(b)(2).
the
bellamy
court
on
one
page
of
its
decision
said
yeah,
that
might
be
the
case.
you
may
be
correct
in
saying
that
it
is
the
rights
that
are
the
subject
of
the
adjective
modified.
however,
the
real
question
is
whether
it
means
unsecured
rights
or
secured
rights.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
make
a
statement
about
the
code
being
a
substantial
change
from
the
act,
which
it
was.
and
therefore...
without
really
looking
at
the
terms
of
the
statute,
therefore
we
must
only
be
talking
about
secured
claims.
a
couple
of
pages
later
in
that
same
decision
that
court
goes
and
automatically,
as
the
hougland,
wilson,
and
hart
courts
did,
take
the
"other
than"
phrase
and
apply
it
to
the
words
"secured
claim",
just
as
if
it
had
forgotten
that
it
already
used
the
rule
of
last
antecedent
to
apply
to
the
entire
phrase
of
that
preceding
phrase.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
to
a
home
mortgage
lender.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
not
necessarily.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
how
may
the
unsecured
rights--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--be
modified?
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding,
a
debtor
is
required
to
submit
to
the
court,
as
required
by
the
code,
his
disposable
income.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that
income
that
is
over
and
above
his
living
expenses,
simply.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that
disposable
income
goes
in
part
to
pay
certain
claims
in
the
bankruptcy
case.
priority
claims.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
potentially,
attorney
fees.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
unsecured
creditors.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
secured
creditors
are
dealt
with...
and
potentially
secured
creditors.
for
example,
the
prepetition
arrearage
on
a
home-mortgage
loan.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
the
unpaid
principal
amount
in
a
typical
residential
mortgage
situation--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--is
going
to
be
included,
in
part,
in
the
prepetition
arrearage.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
because
the
prepetition
arrearage--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--but
now...
the
unpaid
amount?
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
it's
our
position
that
there
cannot
be
any
modification
on
that,
whether
it
is
secured
or
not.
because
the
reading
of
the
statute
says
that
the...
it
is
the
rights,
whether
secured
or
not.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
those
rights
cannot
be
modified
as
against
a
residential--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--usually
that's
the
case,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
debt.
that
is
correct.
except
as
to,
again,
either...
the
1328
discharge,
certain
debts.
there
are
certain
sections
including
long-term
debts.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that
is
our
position,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that
is...
my
position
on
that,
your
honor,
is
that
is
dealt
with
by
another
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
specifically
section
362
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and,
in
certain
cases,
section
1301
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
imposes
upon
the
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition
an
automatic
stay.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
and
what
1322
speaks
to,
your
honor,
is
"a
plan
may
modify"--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--"other
than".
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
that's
a
statutory
modification,
and
that
is
something
that
we
were...
we
live
with.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
in
addition--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
the
way
it
is
currently
written,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
under
506
it
may
not
be
secured,
that's
correct.
but--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
and
so
our
position
would
be
that
the
debtors
need
to
make
some
elections
and
some
choices
about
whether
that
home
is
worth
keeping
or
not.
in
addition,
your
honor,
in
our
case
american
savings
bank
is,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
bankruptcy
court
below,
undersecured.
they
have
a
first
lien
on
the
property,
but
the
value
of
the
property,
as
found
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
is
less
than
the
total
of
that.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
the--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--yes.
that
would
be
an
election
that
i
think
would
make
sense
for
a
homeowner.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
no
secured
claim
after
liquidation
of
the
collateral
through
foreclosure.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
yes.
if
he...
well,
it--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--let
me
answer
that
question
this
way.
it
may
depend
on
how
he
abandons
the
property
to
the
creditor.
there
is
a
practice
in
the
northern
district
bankruptcy
court
of
texas
whereby
certain
debtors
attempt
to
abandon
property
in
full
satisfaction
of
the
debt
to
the
creditor.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
it
may
be
discharged,
and
that's
a
question
that
i
don't
think
is
before
this
court
today,
but--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that...
you're
right.
and
the
answer
i
would
give
to
your
question
is
that
i
don't...
i
do
not
believe...
the
way
that
chapter
13
is
set
up
is
that
that
deficiency
would
be
discharged
because
of
section
1328.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
which
has
the
certain
exceptions
to
discharge
for
chapter
13.
and
one
of
the
exceptions
is
long-term
debt,
and
that
note
is
still
due
and
payable
25
years
in
the
future,
or
whatever
the
maturity
date
is,
which
may
be
outside
the
3
or
5
year
plan
that
the
chapter
13
debtor
is
in.
so
potentially,
yes,
even
a
deficiency
after
foreclosure
in
a
bankruptcy
may
not
be
nondischargeable.
now--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--yes,
it
would.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
because
it
does
not
fall
within
the
exception
of
section
1322.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
we...
my
client
would--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--would
have
filed
and
mended.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
proof
of
claim
for
the
deficiency
after
foreclosure.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
if
the
last
payment
fell
within
the
3
or
5
year
period--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--of
the
code...
of
the
plan.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
when
he
comes
into
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
before
there's
any
claim
determination
or
any
action
by
the
debtor,
that
creditor
holds
a
security
agreement
or
mortgage
on
property
that
is
the
debtor's
that
becomes
property
of
the
estate
when
the
debtor
files
bankruptcy.
at
that
point
in
time,
he's
a
secured
creditor.
he
is
a
creditor
who
has
security.
his
security
may
be
nothing.
his
security
may
be
0,
or--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--under
506(a),
i
believe
he's
a
secured
creditor
only
where
he
falls
within
the
protection
of
the
1322(b)(2).
now,
a
debtor
in
bankruptcy
has
the
opportunity
in
an
adversary
proceeding
under
bankruptcy
rule
7001
to
bring
an
action
to
determine
the
extent,
validity
of
a...
of
a
lien
or
of
a
claim.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
he--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--that--
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
plausible
reading
of
the
two
statutes
together.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
your
honor,
that
may
be
a
plausible
reading.
mr.
michael
j.
schroeder
that's
correct.
