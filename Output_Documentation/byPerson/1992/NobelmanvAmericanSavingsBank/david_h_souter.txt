justice
souter
but
even
if
that
is
so,
you're
still
modifying
it
because
you're
not
going
to
pay
the
same
mortgage
amount
for...
or
the
same
periodic
payment
amount
for
the
same
period
of
time.
justice
souter
no
matter
how
you
cut
it,
you've
got
to
modify
something
with
respect
to
what's
left
of
the
secured
portion.
justice
souter
yeah.
and
the
lien
would
also
be
paid
off
if
you
make
the
same
number
of
payments
you
had
agreed
to
make
before,
but
they
were
smaller
payments,
sure.
so
no
matter...
no
matter
which
way
you
go,
you've
modified
something
with
respect
to
the
secured
claim
beyond
the
amount
of
the
lien.
justice
souter
mr.
schroeder,
could
i
just
interrupt
you
for
a
second--
justice
souter
--with
what
i
assume
is
an
easier
question.
but
i
take
it
on
your
theory,
if
the
one
lien
holder
had
a
second
mortgage
on
a
separate
piece
of
property,
he
wouldn't
have
any
protection.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
the
second
one
is
not
homestead,
that's
right.
justice
souter
one,
he's
got
a
lien
on
the
homestead
and
then
he's
got
a
second
mortgage.
he
doesn't
get
protected.
