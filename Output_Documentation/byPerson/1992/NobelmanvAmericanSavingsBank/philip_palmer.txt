mr.
philip
palmer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
506(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
section
1322(b)(2)
are
compatible
and
can
be
harmonized,
or
whether
they
are
hostile
and
conflict.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
they
are
compatible
and
they
can
be
harmonized.
the
function
of
code
section
506(a)
is
to
divide
a
claim
into
secured
and
unsecured
parts.
a
creditor
who
is
undersecured
under
506(a)
may
wind
up
with
two
claims,
one
of
which
is
a
secured
claim
to
the
extent
of
the
value
of
the
collateral,
and
the
excess,
or
any
amount
above
that,
becomes
an
unsecured
claim.
we
know
that
506(a)
does
apply
in
chapter
13,
because
the
code
tells
us
it
does
in
section
103(a).
but
does
it
apply
specifically
to
chapter
13,
code
section
1322(b)(2)?
everything
i've
said
so
far
is
little
in
dispute
between
the
parties,
but
we
now
reach
the
point
where
the
ways
divide.
the
respondents
argue
that
it
does
not
apply,
in
an
argument
that
is
based
upon
the
1322,
the
clause
that
reads
"other
than
a
claim
secured
only
by
security
interest
in
the
real
property
that
is
the
debtor's
principal
residence.
"
as
you
look
at
the
various
respondent
positions
taken,
they
differ
somewhat
between
themselves
as
to
why
the
506(a).
american
savings
and
freddie
mac
specifically
focus
on
the
word
"rights"
to
tell
us
that
the
"other
than"
clause
modifies
only
the
word
"rights".
nationsbanc,
fannie
mae,
and
the
chapter
13
trustee
look
to
almost
the
same
thing,
"rights
of
holders".
whereas
the
realtor
group,
fannie
mae
again,
and
freddie
mac
look
to
the
word
"claims",
which
they
define
by
going
back
to
the
definitional
section
of
the
code
to
determine
that
a
claim
is
both
a
secured
and
an
unsecured
claim...
indeed,
a
right
to
payment.
none
of
the
respondents
look
to
the
word
"secured"
or
"secured
claim"
together.
now,
the
argument
for
the
application
of
506(a)
can
be
made
first
by
the
rule
of
last
antecedent,
which
was
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
bellamy
case
to
say
you
should
look
to
the
words
that
immediately
precede
the
clause
in
question.
not
just
claims,
but
bellamy
looked
to
the
adjective
as
well,
secured
claims.
another
approach
is
that
when
several
words
are
followed
by
a
clause
and
the
clause
is
just
as
applicable
to
the
first
word
or
the
last
word
or
middle
words,
that
clause
should
be
read
as
applicable
to
all,
which
was
an
approach
espoused
by
justice
o'connor
and
kennedy
in
the
ron
pair
dissent.
either
approach
is
fatal,
because
either
approach
puts
the
word
1322(b)(2).
and
it
is
506(a),
and
506(a)
is
what
the
respondents
must
avoid.
now
if,
as
those
opposed
to
the
application
of
506(a)
would
argue,
that
it
was
not
meant
to
apply,
one
thought
which
occurs
is
that
the
clause
could
have
been
put
at
the
very
first
of
1322(b)(2),
or
at
the
very
end.
in
effect,
to
start
off
by
saying
"other
than"
what
i'll
call
a
homestead
mortgage,
the
debtor
may
modify
secured
or
unsecured
claims,
and
you
could
reach
the
same
reasoning
at
the
end.
or
as
another
alternative,
congress
intended
that
both
the
secured
and
the
unsecured
homestead
lands
were
untouchable,
and
put
in
something
equivalent
to
the
1111(b)
option
that
is
found
in
chapter
11
and
with
which
all
respondents
seem
to
be
happy.
but
none
of
those
things
happened.
and
if
you
simply
take
the
statute
as
it
reads,
506(a),
for
the
determination
of
what
is
a
secured
claim,
and
1322
by
either
of
the
techniques
of
the
"other
than"
clause,
you
come
out
with
a
statute
that
is
consistent.
it
harmonizes,
there
is
no
conflict.
we
do
not
need
to
search
further
for
the
intention
of
congress
because
it
is
expressed
clearly.
mr.
philip
palmer
they
were
not
and,
in
fact,
have
not.
but
in
answering
that,
of
course,
the
key,
the
operable
words
are
secured
claim.
if
you
accept,
as
we
do,
506(a),
that
secured
claim
is
only
the
$23,500
the
condominium
was
worth,
we're
not
altering.
mr.
philip
palmer
and
that
argument--
mr.
philip
palmer
--let
me
answer
or
state
to
the
first
one
first,
and
then
we'll
come
to
the
rights
of
holders.
the
secured
claims
that
i
was
referring
to
is
the
language
that
is
before
the
comma
in
1322(b)(2):
the
"secured
only
by
a
security
interest.
"
the
argument
has
been
made
that
to
really
say
clearly
what
i
am
arguing,
you
would
have
to
say
secured
claim
secured.
and
that
is
rejected
by
bellamy
upon
the
proposition
that
that
would
be
a
wooden
and
awkward
way
to
force
congress
to
express
its
intent;
that
there
is
really
no
significant
difference
between
a
secured
claim
and
a
claim
secured.
and,
of
course,
our
position
would
be
the
same
as
bellamy.
on
the
rights
of
holders,
if
i
may
borrow
your
own
language
from
the
ron
pair
dissent.
mr.
philip
palmer
it's
been
cited
several
times
for
the
grammatical
analysis
which,
frankly,
does
appeal
to
me
at
this
moment.
[laughter]
if
you
take...
or
if
you
accept
that
there
is
some
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
"other
than"
clause
applies,
if
you
do
not
accept
the
bellamy
rule
of
last
antecedent,
then
we
seem
to
fall
right
into
the
analysis
that
you
made...
with
considerable
and
respectable
authority,
i
might
add...
that
it
must
apply
to
the
whole
thing,
rights
of
holders
of
secured
claims.
but
what
are
the
rights
of
the
holders
of
the
secured
claims?
and
that
brings
us
back,
i
think,
to
the
operative
word,
"secured
claim".
we're
not
now
speaking
about
the
rights
of
holders
of
secured,
or
partially
secured,
or
secured
and
unsecured
claims,
but
only
secured
claims.
there
are
some
other
points
that
lead
to
somewhat
the
same
analysis.
mr.
philip
palmer
dewsnup
and
lien
pass
through,
we
can
certainly
start
it
now
and
may
not
finish.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
dewsnup
forecloses
the
argument
that
was
made
here.
and,
of
course,
all
are
aware
that
that
was
a
chapter
7
case.
all
are
aware
that
that
was
dealing
to
506(d).
and
i
think
all
are
aware
that
that
was...
the
issue
there
was
whether
or
not
an
abandonment
would
revive
the
lien
that
appeared
by
its
terms
to
be
cut
off
under
506(d).
and
what
i
think
the
court
held,
and
properly,
was
that
506(d)
applies
only
when
it
is
not
an
allowed
secured
claim
claim.
because
otherwise,
code
liens
would
not
pass
through
the
act
the
way
that
act
liens
did.
now,
when
i
say
pass
to...
through,
i
think
this
court
was
speaking
in
terms
of
unadministered.
they
come
into
the
estate
at
the
beginning,
but
they
are
abandoned
out
of
the
estate
and
they
should
go
out
as
they
came
in,
with
the
same
lien
encumbered.
that
was
the
old
bankruptcy
act
rule
and
it
was...
the
court
found
nothing
in
the
code
or
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
any
intent
to
change
that.
and
the
results
of
implying
such
a
change
would
be
a
rather
unfair
windfall
to
the
debtor,
because
it
would
be
a
permanent
reduction
even
though
it
no
longer
served
a
bankruptcy
purpose.
but
none
of
those
considerations
apply
here.
chapter
13,
as
indeed
do
chapter
11
and
12,
have
a
built
in
protection
against
the
windfall
problem.
chapters
11
and
12
keep...
and
13
keep
the
property
in
the
estate;
abandonment
is
not
a
problem.
i
see
nothing
in
the
dewsnup
case
that
indicates
that
it
would
move
beyond
the
chapter
7
abandonment
factual
situation
the
court
applied
it
to.
there
is
a
reference
in
dewsnup...
and
the
chapter
13
trustee
here
speaks
to
it
in
her
brief...
that
506(a)
does
not,
by
itself,
avoid
liens;
it
simply
classifies
claims
into
secured
and
unsecured.
but
that
something
further...
as
i
recall,
she
used
the
word
catalyst...
some
catalyst
is
required.
and
this
court
determined
that
506(d)
did
not
apply
in
chapter
7.
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
the
dewsnup
opinion
should
be
expanded
to
say
506(d)
does
not
apply
in
chapter
13
either,
that's
not
the
catalyst
that
avoids
the
excess
lien
in
chapter
13.
instead,
it's
section
1327(c),
which
is
the
effect
of
confirmation
rule,
that
reduces
the
property
to
the
value...
by...
well,
mechanically
it
revests
the
property
in
the
debtor
free
and
clear
of
whatever
amount
has
been
determined
to
be
an
excessive
value.
so
a
1327(c)
trigger,
and
a
discharge
under
1328,
except
as
to
long-term
debts
assumed
by
the
plan,
which
would
include
the
mortgage,
as
reduced
in--
obviously,
dewsnup
spoke
to
none
of
those
issues.
i
don't
think
they
were
before
the
court.
and
i
see
dewsnup
as
a
case
somewhat
limited
in
its
scope
to
arrive
at
a
proper
result.
mr.
philip
palmer
when
we
took
our
noon
break,
we
were
discussing
dewsnup,
and
i'd
like
to
pick
up
again
at
that
point.
dewsnup,
of
course,
was
a
chapter
7
case.
dewsnup
did
not
involve
homestead
or
residence;
it
involved
farmland
in
utah.
and
the
argument
was
made
in
dewsnup
that
because
there
had
been
a
valuation
of
the
property
at
a
value
well
below
the
total
amount,
the
total
amount
of
the
debt,
that
that
was
something
akin
to
albatross
branded
to
that
property,
even
after
that
property
was
abandoned
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
so
that
no
distribution
purpose
in
the
bankruptcy
remained.
the
court
felt,
and
i
think
with
justification,
that
that
was
an
unfair
result.
should
the
property
appreciate
in
value,
it
would
create
a
windfall
to
the
debtor.
the
court
found
506(d)
ambiguous,
and
having
made
that
initial
determination
then
determined
that
the
court
was
uncomfortable
in
changing
pre-code
law
on
ambiguous
language
when
there
was
no
legislative
history
whatever
to
support
it.
but
we
turn
then
to
chapter
13
and
its
differences.
chapter
13,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
rehabilitation
sections.
the
property
is
not
abandoned
from
the
estate
but
remains
in
the
estate,
and
that
is
true
even
if
there
is
no
objection
to
the
exemption
status
as
homestead.
exempt
property
does
not
pass
from
the
chapter
13
estate
until
after
the
plan
has
been
confirmed,
and
only
then
under
1327
does
it
pass
from
the
estate.
the
purpose
of
determining
exemptions
in
chapter
13
is
not,
as
in
chapter
7,
to
have
it
pass
from
the
estate,
but
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
debtor
must
include
in
its
payments
to
creditors
an
amount
equal
to
all
of
its
nonexempt
property.
now,
that's
all
a
chapter
7
debtor
does,
is
surrender
his
nonexempt
property.
but
a
chapter
13
debtor
is
required
to
do
more
than
that.
the
chapter
13
debtor
must
not
only
pay
the
value
of
all
of
his
nonexempt
property,
but
must
also
pay
his
nondisposable
income...
that
is
to
the
excess
under
his
monthly
budget,
his
nondisposable
income
for
3
years
to
get
the
benefits
of
a
chapter
13.
chapter
13
is
a
favored
chapter
in
bankruptcy,
and
that
has
been
a
consistent
purpose
of
congress
and
that's
well
reflected
in
legislative
history
throughout.
mr.
philip
palmer
favored
over
chapter
7.
because
chapter
13
presents
a
man
who
is
doing
more
than
the
legal
minimum
that
he
would
have
to
do
to
receive
a
discharge
of
his
debts.
mr.
philip
palmer
than
he
would
have
to
do
under
chapter
7,
yes.
mr.
philip
palmer
that
is
true.
otherwise,
i
assume
it
would
be
very
hard
to
sell.
but
those
benefits
are
these.
first,
he
will
consider
chapter
7
when
he
needs
to
take
an
internal
revenue
service,
a
tax
debt
otherwise
nondischargeable,
and
wants
to
pay
it
out
over
a
period
of
time.
or
he
wishes
to
save
a
homestead,
because
dewsnup
now
makes
it
clear
chapter
7
will
not
help
him
save
a
homestead.
or
in
those
states
where
exemptions
are
parsimonious
and
he
would
rather
value
and
pay
for
his
furniture,
car,
et
cetera
than
give
them
up.
those
are
the
benefits
of
chapter
13.
saving
a
homestead,
i
will
not
deny,
is
a
major
benefit
in
chapter
13,
and
one
reason
why
many
people
select
chapter
13.
but
if
the
respondents
prevail
today,
that
incentive
will
be
taken
away
and
there
will
be
more
people
filing
chapter
7
than
13.
well,
there
is
another
i
should
mention,
and
that
is
that
the
grounds
for
objection
to
discharge
in
chapter
13
are
more
restrictive
than
they
are
in
7.
that's
really
not
a
major
consideration
for
the
average
couple,
but
it's
also
a
benefit
of
13
over
7.
mr.
philip
palmer
let
me
begin
by
explaining
it
in
an
area
where
there
is
absolutely
no
controversy
between
the
parties,
the
$50,000
lien
on
the
$100,000
automobile.
all
the
same...
instruments
are
the
same.
security
agreement
instead
of
the
deed
of
trust,
but
other
than
that
exactly
the
same.
506(a)
and
1322(b)(2)
clearly
permit
the
valuation
of
the
lien,
the
secured
claim,
to
$1,000,
on
the
proposition
that
that's
all
the
car
is
worth.
if
the
car
were
abandoned,
the
lienholder
could
get
no
more
than
the
$1,000
fair
market
value
and
have
an
unsecured
claim
for
$49,000.
if
we
move
it
to
a
homestead,
the
result
is
exactly
the
same
unless,
of
course,
the
"other
than"
clause
gives
more
protection
than
we
say
it
does.
the
debtor...
the
creditor
will
have
a
$23,500
secured
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
palmer
well,
the
single
instrument
is
defined
as
between
the
parties
and
in
a
nonbankruptcy
context.
but
when
you
go
into
a
bankruptcy,
506(a)
applies
whether
it...
the
debt's
in
one
instrument
or
two
instruments.
mr.
philip
palmer
well,
at
the
inception
we
apply
506
and
1322(b)(2),
and
we've
talked
about
that.
then
we
have
confirmation.
the
confirmation
section,
which
is
1327,
provides
in
section
(c)
that
all
of
the
property
of
the
estate
not
otherwise
dealt
with
revests
in
the
debtor
free
and
clear
of
any
amount
other
than
the
secured
claim.
so
that's
how
we
get
our
one
instrument
down
to
a
twenty
three
thousand
five--
mr.
philip
palmer
--well,
we're
not
going
to
modify
the
unsecured
rights.
we're
going
to
treat
them
as
unsecured
rights
under
the
plan.
the
remaining
portion
of
the
claim
was
unsecured;
the
plan
will
treat
of
unsecured
claims.
mr.
philip
palmer
that's
506(a).
mr.
philip
palmer
i
say
the
latter.
mr.
philip
palmer
that
approaches
it
backwards,
i
have
to
admit,
from
the
way
i've
always
looked
at
it.
mr.
philip
palmer
i've
always
looked
at
it
that
we're
modifying
the
secured
portion
and
thereby
automatically
making
the
rest
unsecured.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
ever
dealt
with
modifying
the
unsecured
portion
of
the
claim.
once
it's
become
an
unsecured
portion,
the
debtor
can
deal
with
it
in
his
claim.
mr.
philip
palmer
all
right.
i
would
think
that
you
could
propose
a
plan
that
says
we
will
value
down
all
secured
claims,
homestead,
car,
et
cetera,
to
fair
market
value,
and
we
will
pay
25
cents
on
the
dollar
for
all
unsecured
claims.
there
i've
modified
unsecured
claims,
which
i
have
a
right
to
do.
that's
not
in
dispute.
i
have
a
right
to
modify
unsecured
claims.
mr.
philip
palmer
all
claims
are
supposed
to
be
filed
in
a
13.
mr.
philip
palmer
there's
nothing
equivalent
to
111(a)
where--
mr.
philip
palmer
--traditionally,
yes.
mr.
philip
palmer
no.
the
debtor
draws
the
issue
by
filing
the
plan.
mr.
philip
palmer
which
says
we
value...
as
they
did
here...
we
value
your
equity
at
$23,500.
that
will
be
the
amount
of
your
secured
claim.
mr.
philip
palmer
has
filed
a
claim
for
the
full
amount.
mr.
philip
palmer
it...
as
a
secured
claim.
mr.
philip
palmer
that
is
so.
and
that
was,
in
effect,
done
here
at
the
confirmation
hearing.
but
of
all
the
court
of
appeals
cases,
the
four
that
conflict
with
the
fifth
circuit
decision,
every
one
of
those,
the
values
were
agreed
or
stipulated.
apparently,
it's
not
a
big
batch.
mr.
philip
palmer
but
the
opportunity
is
always
there.
there's
one
thing
that--
mr.
philip
palmer
--no,
it
was
another
point.
mr.
philip
palmer
they
do.
that's
what
we
contend
is
the
meaning
of
the
"other
than"
clause.
we
must
continue
to
pay
the
same
mortgage
amount.
mr.
philip
palmer
no.
mr.
philip
palmer
well,
the...
if
you
reduce
the
balance
that's
due...
the
unpaid
principal,
if
you
will,
to
the
$23,500,
when
the
payments,
after
interest
service,
have
reached
$23,500,
that
lien
will
be
paid
off.
mr.
philip
palmer
i
have
reduced
the
amount
of
the
debt
by
what
we
have
determined
to
be
unsecured.
