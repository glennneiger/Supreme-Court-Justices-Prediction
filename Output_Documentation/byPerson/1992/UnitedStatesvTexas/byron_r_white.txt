mr.
todd,
what
if
the
agency,
we're
talking
the
department
of
justice,
had
decided
that
the
debt
collection
act
does
not,
cancelled
out
any
liability
of
the
states
to
pay
interest,
that
it
just
did
away
with
the
common
law
remedy?
would
you
think
we
should
owe
some
deference
to
their
construction
there?
i
would
suppose
you
would
hope
we
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no,
no
deference.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
said
it's
a
toss
up,
it's
50-50.
here's
the
agency,
thinks
the
common
law
has
been
repealed.
would
we,
should
we
then
give
the
nod
to
the
agency
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
just
say
no.
we
do
it
de
novo.
we
do
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--we're
construing
a
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
give
any
deference,
in
my
50-50
case
we
give
the
nod
to
the
agency.
