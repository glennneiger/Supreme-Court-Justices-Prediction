mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
the
united
states
retains
its
long-standing
common
law
right
to
collect
prejudgment
interest
on
debts
owed
by
state
and
local
governments.
the
case
arises
in
the
context
of
the
federal
food
stamp
program.
under
that
program
the
united
states
distributes
food
stamps
to
participating
states
for
issuance
to
eligible
individuals.
states
like
texas
that
choose
to
distribute
food
stamps
through
the
mail
are
contractually
liable
to
the
united
states
for
a
portion
of
the
value
of
the
food
stamps
that
are
lost
or
stolen
in
the
mail.
in
1986
and
1987
the
united
states
asserted
claims
against
texas
amounting
to
over
$400,000
for
losses
arising
out
of
the
state's
issuance
of
food
stamps
in
the
mail.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
validity
of
those
claims,
but
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
united
states
was
not
entitled
to
collect
prejudgment
interest
on
the
state's
debts.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
indicated,
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
is
in
keeping
with
fundamental
principles
of
fairness
and
equity
and
serves
to
insure
that
neither
party
to
a
dispute
benefits
or
suffers
from
a
delay
in
payment.
for
those
reasons
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
collect
prejudgment
interest
from
the
states
and
from
local
governments
has
long
been
recognized
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law.
respondents
argue
that
congress
intentionally
abrogated
that
long-standing
common
law
right
when
it
enacted
the
debt
collection
act
of
1982,
but
the
language
and
purpose
of
that
act
and
traditional
canons
of
statutory
construction
require
rejection
of
respondents'
argument.
the
language
of
the
debt
collection
act
does
not
address
the
question
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
act
says
only
that
states
are
not
persons
for
purposes
of
the
mandatory
prejudgment
interest
and
delinquency
penalty
provisions
of
31
u.s.c.
section
3717.
standing
alone,
that
exclusion
from
the
scope
of
section
3717
does
not
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
go
further
and
to
abrogate
the
existing
common
law
remedy.
the
common
law
remedy
is
discretionary
and
flexible
and
allows
courts
to
weigh
the
interests
of
the
state
better
in
determining
whether
and
to
what
extent
to
award
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in
this
case
the
united
states
would
not
have
had
the
choice
to
proceed
under
the
debt
collection
act
because
the
debt
collection
act's
prejudgment
interest
remedy
expressly
excludes
the
states.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
debt
collection
act
doesn't
create
a
cause
of
action.
it
just,
it
sets
forth
certain
remedies
and
certain
specific
contexts
for
the
federal
government's
debt
collection
efforts.
it's
not
even
a
comprehensive
scheme
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
where
the...
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
substantive
cause
of
action
comes
from
the
food
stamp
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
if
we're
referring
to
the
federal
common,
the
federal
cause
of
action,
which
is
a
different
question
than
the
remedy
for
prejudgment
interest
in
our
view,
the
cause
of
action...
i
am
sure
the
united
states
would
have
a
cause
of
action
that
could
either
be
viewed
as
an
implied
right
of
action
under
the
food
stamp
act
or
as
the
more
general
federal
cause
of
action
for
money
had
and
received,
which
is
at
issue
in
the
united
states
against
california
case.
but
in
either
event
we
would
submit
that
prejudgment
interest
would
be
available
under
the
separate
remedial
rule
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
affirmed,
which
is
that
where
a
sum
of
money
is
owing
to
the
united
states
prejudgment
interest
is
generally
available,
depending
on
the
equities
of
the
particular
situation.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in
this
context,
yes,
your
honor,
because
this
would
be
an
action
against
a
state
and
states
are
excluded
from
the
scope
of
section
3717.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
again,
your
honor,
because
the
common
law
remedy
is
flexible
and
discretionary,
that
is
up
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
believe
it
could,
your
honor,
but
it
might,
depending
on
the
equities
of
the
particular
situation,
if
there
had
been
some
undue
delay
perhaps
then
it
would
be
inequitable
to
impose
liability
prior
to
that
date.
the
court
could
determine
that
the
date
of
the
complaint
would
be
the
first
date
from
which
interest
would
accrue.
i
would
think
the
general
rule,
though,
would
be
that
interest
begins
accruing
once
the
debt
is
liquidated
and
owing.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
no
discretion
in
the
court.
agencies
have
some
limited
discretion,
assuming
they
have
promulgated
regulations
to
that
effect.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
common
law
remedy
is
quite
distinct
and
different
from
the
statutory
remedy.
the
statutory
remedy
is
mandatory.
it
requires
courts
to
impose
prejudgment
interest
at
a
specified
mandatory
minimum
statutory
rate,
which
is
not
true
of
the
common
law.
it
requires
collection
of
processing
fees
and
delinquency
penalties
in
appropriate
cases,
which
is
not
true
of
the
common
law.
it
applies
to
more
debts
or
more
obligations
than
does
the
common
law
remedy.
and
the
biggest
distinction
is
the
fact
of
course
that
the
statute
is
mandatory
on
the
courts,
the
common
law
has
discretion.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
prejudgment,
although
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question,
i
think
that
prejudgment
interest
could
be
available
under
the
common
law
even
beyond
a
purely
contractual
relationship
if
it
were
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
state
has
argued
in
this
court
that
the
plain
statement
rule
announced
by
this
court
in
pennhurst
would
bar
application
of
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
the
state
is
arguing
that
even
if
prejudgment
interest
is
appropriate
an
award
of
prejudgment
interest
should
not
be
awarded
in
this
case,
and
it's
not
clear
to
what
extent
the
state
is
making
that
argument,
but
certainly
to
the
extent
the
state
is
making
that
argument
that
would
be
a
valid
consideration
on
remand
in
determining
whether
prejudgment
interest
is
available.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i'm
sure
that
the
private
debtors
who
have
now
been
subjected
to
section
3717
would
disagree
with
your
characterization
that
section
3717
is
fairer
than
the
common
law.
under
the
common
law
their
equitable
defenses
could
be
considered.
under
section
3717
they
cannot.
the
courts
must
impose
prejudgment
interest
at,
according
to
the
legislative
history,
at
rates
typically
higher
than
were
imposed
under
the
common
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
but
the
government--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--congress
was
attempting
to
enhance
the
federal
government's
abilities
to
collect
debts
as
against
those
entities
covered
by
the
act,
but
congress
could
well
have
determined
that
it
would
be
inappropriate,
for
example,
to
impose
on
state
and
local
governments
the
delinquency
penalties
and
the
processing
fees
that
are
mandated
by
section
3717
in
addition
to
the
statutory
minimum
rate
of
interest.
congress
could
also
well
have
determined
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
leave
state
and
local
governments
subject
to
the
flexible
common
law
remedy
under
which
the
courts
are
permitted
to
weigh
the
interests
of
the
state
debtor
in
determining
whether
in
the
particular
case
an
award
of
interest
is
appropriate.
none
of
that
is
possible
under
the
statute,
so
it's
entirely
conceivable
that
congress
wanted
to
leave
the
states
subject
to
the
common
law
rather
than
imposing
the
stricter
and
harsher
provisions
of
section
3717.
and
that's
the
most
natural,
in
our
view
that's
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
language.
it's
sort
of
an
odd
and
round
about
way
to
achieve
a
formal,
an
affirmative
abrogation
of
the
existing
law
simply
to
exclude
state
and
local
governments
from
the
scope
of
a
non-comprehensive
limited
statute,
which
is
what
the
debt
collection
act
was.
the
debt
collection
act
was
not
a
comprehensive
scheme
designed
to
answer
all
questions
that
might
arise
with
respect
to
the
government's
debt
collection
efforts.
it
addresses
a
few
discrete
areas
in
an
attempt,
as
the
statute
itself
says,
to
enhance
the
federal
government's
debt
collection
efforts.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's...
it
does
not,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
cause
of
action,
the
debt
collection
act
assumes
that
some
other
statute
or
some
other--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
against
the
states,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
would
be
denominated
to
cause
of
action,
but
it
certainly
mandates
that
a
prejudgment
interest
remedy
in
the
context
of
private
debtors
but
does
not
address
the
question
of
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
a
prejudgment
interest
remedy
in
the
context
of
state
debtors.
but
at
the
very
least
the
statutory
language
is
equally
susceptible
to
interpretation.
even
if
it's
equally
reasonable,
which
we
think
it's
not,
to
read
the
statute
in
the
way
that
the
state
does,
it's
certainly
reasonable
to
read
it
in
the
way
we
do.
if
congress
had
in
fact
intended
to
leave
the
law
with
respect
to
the
states
alone,
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
rational
way
of
achieving
that
result
is
to
say
this
statute
doesn't
apply
to
the
states,
because
the
general
presumption
in
all
areas
is,
and
specifically
when
we're
talking
about
the
common
law,
is
that
when
congress
doesn't
legislate
with
respect
to
that
particular
question
it
leaves
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
was.
and
that's
all
we're
saying
happened
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
provides
no
support
for
a
contrary
conclusion.
in
fact,
as
i
have
noted,
that
congress
expressly
stated
in
its
statutory
preamble
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
provide
additional
remedies
to
assist
the
federal
government
in
collecting
its
debts.
it
would
be
extremely
odd
to
construe
a
statute
intended
to
assist
the
federal
government
and
enhance
its
debt
collection
efforts
in
a
manner
that
would
cut
back
on
existing
remedies
against
a
certain
class
of
debtors.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
section
3701(c)
exempts
state
and
local
governments
and
federal
agencies.
i
believe
a
separate
provision
of
the
c.f.r.
exempts
federal
agencies
from
the
entire
federal
claims
collection
standard,
so
in
effect
i
think
that's
correct.
there
may
be
other
exemptions...
i'm
sorry,
let
me
amend
that.
there
are--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
let
me
amend
my
previous
answer.
they
omitted
from
that,
that
excerpt
that
we
have
reproduced
there
because
it
isn't
at
issue,
directly
at
issue
in
this
case,
other
provisions,
other
exemptions
from
section
3717.
in
particular
4
c.f.r.
102.13(i)
states
that
the
provisions
of
31
u.s.c.
3717
do
not
apply
to
debts
owed
by
state
and
local
governments,
to
debts
arising
under
contracts
entered
into
before
the
debt
collection
act
was
created,
to
debts
arising
under
certain
specific
statutes
such
as
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
so
forth.
so
there
are,
in
addition
to
state
and
local
government
debts
there
are
other
debts
that
are
not
subject
to
the
debt
collection
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
in
our
view
states
and
local
governments
are
not
subject
to
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
debt
collection
act,
although
of
course
they
are
subject
to
other
provisions
of
federal
law
having
to
do
with
debt
collection.
but
the
debt
collection
act
was
merely
a
sort
of
haphazard
collection
of
a
few
additional
remedies
that
congress
wanted
to
give
the
federal
government.
the
only
remedies
that
would
have
had
any
application
to
the
states
were
administrative
offset
and
prejudgment
interest,
and
congress
excluded
the
states
from
those
sections.
none
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
have
any,
appear
to
have
any
application
to
the
states
at
all.
respondents
in
their
brief
cite
31
u.s.c.
section
3714,
which
provides
an
administrative
offset
against
the
states
in
limited
contexts,
but
that
is
not
part
of
the
debt
collection
act.
that
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
act
of
march
25,
1870
and
has
been
on
the
books
for
over
100
years
and
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
debt
collection
act.
as
respondents
themselves
say
in
their
brief,
congress
was
not
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
state
and
local
government
debtors
in
enacting
the
debt
collection
act,
it
was
focused
on
a
different
problem.
so
it
would
be
particularly
unlikely
that
even
though
it
was
focused
on
a
different
set
of
problems
it
nonetheless
went
out
of
its
way
and
intended
to
abrogate
the
common
law
in
the
context
that
it
was
not
even
addressing.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because
congress
is
understood
to
legislate
against
the
backdrop
of
traditional
canons
of
statutory
construction,
and
one
of
those
traditional
canons
is
that
congress
will
not
be
deemed
to
have
changed
the
law
and
in
particular
will
not
be
deemed
to
have
abrogated
existing
and
long-standing
common
law
rules.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
certainly.
we
would
not
be
here
if
they
had
done
that,
but
the
point
is
the
rules
of
statutory
construction
consistently
followed
by
this
court
show
that
congress
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
the
rule
cuts
the
other
way.
congress
has
to
give
some
express
indication,
not
necessarily
in
the
text,
but
somewhere,
of
its
intention
to
achieve
the
opposite
result
or
it
will
be
deemed
to
have
left
the
law
as
it
was.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
mobil
oil
against
higginbotham
is
perhaps
an
analogous
statute.
in
that
case,
that
case
involved
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
and
in
the
context,
in
cases
where
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
applied
the
court
held
in
mobil
oil
that
it
abrogated
the
common
law.
you
couldn't
have
a
different
remedy--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
federal
common
law
does,
it
did
not
originally
but
i
believe
in
1970
in
the
marine
case,
or
perhaps
earlier,
but
in
any
event
at
some
point
the
court
did
determine
that
the
federal
maritime
law
did
create
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
if
i
may
explain,
justice
stevens,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
contains
an
express
exception
for
cases
arising
in
state
territorial
waters,
but
it
applies
on
the
high
seas.
and
in
the
mobil
oil
case
the
court
said
where
the
act
applies,
where
it
creates
a
remedy
and
a
legal
standard
that
applies,
the
common
law
remedy
does
not
apply.
you
can't
have
a
different
result
under
the
common
law
than
you
would
under
the
statute.
but
where
the
act
does
not
apply,
that
is
in
state
territorial
waters,
you
can
have
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action.
because
the
act
doesn't
apply
there,
therefore
congress
has
not
abrogated
the
common
law.
we
think
that's
exactly
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
the
act
applies
to
private
parties,
and
in
that
context
therefore
congress
has
spoken
and
the
federal
common
law
does
not
exist.
but
the
act
does
not
apply
to
the
states
and
therefore
the
state,
the
common
law
continues
to
exist
in
that
context.
and
respondents
have
pointed
to
no
case
in
which
the
only
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
abrogate
the
common
law
was
the
fact
that
congress
had
chosen
not
to
apply
the
statute
in
that
context.
there
is
no
case
from
this
court
that
stands
for
that
proposition,
and
it
would
be
quite
an
extension
for
this
court
to
say
that
merely
by
declining,
merely
by
deciding
not
to
legislate
in
a
particular
area
congress
has
thereby
determined
to
abrogate
the
existing
law
in
that
area.
and
we
submit
that
would,
that
that
is
not
an
appropriate
way
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it's
certainly
correct
that
agencies
do
not
have
the
authority
under
the
common
law
to
require
states
to
pay
a
particular
rate
of
interest
in
a
particular
case.
that
decision
is
up
to
the
courts.
the
agencies
can--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
would
not
read
the
regulation
in
that
way,
your
honor,
and
if
it
were
read
in
that
way
it
would
be
incorrect.
federal
agencies
can,
as
the
federal
agency
did
in
this
case,
inform
the
state
that
they
intend
to
seek
prejudgment
interest
and
even,
as
they
did
in
this
case,
specify
the
rate
at
which
they
want
prejudgment
interest
to
accrue.
and
if
the
case
never
gets
to
court,
if
it's
settled
and
the
state
agrees
to
pay
that
obligation,
well,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
if
the
case
does
get
to
court
obviously
it's
up
to
the
district
court
to
select
the
appropriate
rate
of
interest
and
indeed
to
determine
whether
interest
is
available.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
we
would
not,
i
would
not
view
the
remedy,
the
prejudgment
interest
remedy
as
a
cause
of
action.
it's
more
of
a
remedy
tacked
onto
an
existing
cause
of
action.
if...
here
the
food
stamp
act
creates
the
liability
and
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
recover,
and
the
prejudgment
interest
remedy
merely
insures
that
that
liability
is
in
fact
paid.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
deference
to
the
administrative
construction
of
the
statute
is
appropriate
because
the
question
here
is
not
whether
prejudgment
interest
is
appropriate
in
this
case
or
whether
the
common
law
prejudgment
interest
remedy
exists.
those
are
questions
for
the
court.
the
question
here
is
whether
congress,
in
enacting
the
debt
collection
act
of
1982,
evidenced
a
congressional
intent
to
abrogate
the
existing
common
law
remedy.
and
that
is
the
issue
that
the
administrative
agency
has
determined
in
our
favor,
and
we
believe
that
is
what
is
due
deference.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because
the
agency's
authority
to
construe
the
debt
collection
act
is
limited
once
the
agency
has
determined,
as
the
agencies
have
determined
in
this
case,
that
the
debt
collection
act
does
not
abrogate
the
common
law.
when
proceeding
against
a
state,
a
federal
agency
is
by
definition
proceeding
under
the
common
law
and
under
the
common
law
of
the
courts,
not
the
agency
determining
whether
interest
is
appropriate
and
the
rate
of
interest
that
is
appropriate.
so
the
only,
we're
only
asking
for
deference
to
the
administrative
determination
that
the
act
that
the
administrative
agencies
are
charged
to
implement
does
not
abrogate
the
common
law,
because
that's
not
what
congress
intended
to
achieve.
we
submit
that
that
is
an
entirely
appropriate
arena
for--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor,
the
courts
implement
the
common
law.
the
agencies
are
charged
with
authority
to
construe
the
debt
collection
act,
and
in
the
exercise
of
that
congressionally
delegated
authority
the
agencies
have
determined
the
scope
of
the
debt
collection
act,
and
in
their
view
the
debt
collection
act
does
not
abrogate
the
common
law.
that's
the
end
of
the
agencies,
of
the
scope
of
the
agencies'
deference.
but
that
determination,
which
is
the
determination
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
any
ambiguity
that
there
may
be
in
the
regulation
is
quite
clearly
resolved
by
the
explanatory
statement
in
the
notice
of
rule
making
that
accompanied
the
promulgation
of
that
regulation
in
1984,
which
we
have
discussed
that
in
our
opening
brief.
the
agencies,
the
general
accounting
office
and
the
department
of
justice,
addressed
the
precise
question
whether
the
debt
collection
act
abrogated
the
federal
common
law
and
concluded
that
it
did
not,
and
that
the
federal
common
law
right
of
prejudgment
interest
continued
to
exist
in
the
case
of
state
and
local
government
debtors.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
mean
that.
it
would
mean
that
the
regulation
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
any
event,
your
honor,
deference
is
due
not
merely
to
agency
regulations
but
in
general
to
agency
interpretations--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
the
state
has
not
disputed
that
the
agencies
possess
the
authority
to
implement
the
provisions
of
the
debt
collection
act.
31
u.s.c.
3711(e)(2)
provides
that
authority.
the
general
accounting
office
and
the
department
of
justice
are
authorized
to
promulgate
standards--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--agencies
routinely
in
the
exercise
of
delegated
power
judge
and
determine
the
scope
of
federal
statutes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
with
respect,
your
honor,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
the
brief,
the
k
mart
case,
the
rust
against
sullivan,
the
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
case.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
agencies
were
determining
the
scope
of
the
statute.
in
the
k
mart
case,
for
example,
the
court
was,
the
agency
was
determining
whether
the
statute
allowed
or
did
not
allow,
that
is
applied
or
did
not
apply
to
particular
importations
of
gray
market
goods,
and
the
regulations
said
that
in
some
cases
the
statute
does
apply
and
forbid
it,
and
in
other
cases
it
doesn't,
the
statute
does
not
apply.
and
the
court
deferred
to
that
interpretation.
that's
all
we're
asking
here.
the
agencies
have
determined
that
the
debt
collection
act
does
not
apply,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to,
in
enacting
the
debt
collection
act,
abrogate
the
common
law,
and
therefore
the
scope
of
the
act
does
not
extend
to
the
states.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
question.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
true.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
with
respect,
your
honor,
in
the
k
mart
case,
by
finding
that
the
act
did
not
apply,
it
did
not
forbid
the
importation
of
the
particular
gray
market
goods
at
issue,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
goods
could
be
imported.
the
statute
did
not
forbid
it,
and
therefore
the
agency's
duty
to
exclude
it
did
not
exist.
the
same
is
here
in
the
sense
that
the
act
does
not
apply,
so...
if
the
agencies
had,
if
the
department
of
justice
and
the
general
accounting
office
had
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
and
had
determined
that
the
act
did
abrogate
the
common
law,
it
would
have
been
their
duty
in
implementing
the
act
to
instruct
federal
agencies
not
to
seek
prejudgment
interest
from
the
states.
but
they
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
our
submission
is
that
that
conclusion
was
reasonable.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
state's
burden
in
this
case
is
to
show
that
a
statute
expressly
intended
to
enhance
the
federal
government's
debt
collection
efforts.
in
fact
it
had
the
effect
of
creating
an
unprecedented
disincentive
for
an
important
class
of
debtors
to
pay--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor,
west
virginia
was
the
first
such
case.
board
of
commissioners
said,
treated
state
and
local
governments
in
the
same
breath,
but
that
case
involved
a
local
government.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
west
virginia
case
itself
arose
in
the
mid
1970's.
it
didn't
reach
the
supreme
court
until
1987,
but
at
least
in
that
context
the
federal
government
had
been
seeking
prejudgment
interest
from
the
states
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
debt
collection
act
and
prior
to
the
west
virginia
case.
that's
how
the
case
came
up.
the
state
argues
that
the
city
of
milwaukee
case
is
the
most
relevant
here,
but
the
city
of
milwaukee
case
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
situation
here.
the
statute
at
issue
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
case
provided
an
express
answer
to
the
very
question
at
issue
in
that
case,
the
effluent
limitations
that
should
be
imposed
on
the
source
of
pollution.
thank
you.
