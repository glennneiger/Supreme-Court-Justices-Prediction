justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
before
you
get
to
the
legislative
history--
[laughter]
--i
suppose
the
best
argument
for
the
other
side,
it's
really
a
sort
of
inclusio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius
argument,
and
why
doesn't
it
make
a
lot
of
sense?
why,
can
you
explain
to
us
why
it
would,
why
the
government
would
want
to
establish
these
new
rules
that
are
apparently
fairer
and
more
efficient
for
all
other
interests
but
somehow
not
for
interests
owing
by
the
states?
it
seems
to
me
much
more
likely
that
they
were
simply
saying
no
interest
from
the
states,
you
just
don't
get
it,
and
where
you
get
interest
these
are
the
fair
and
efficient
rules
for
getting
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
think
that's
fair
to
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
mean
congress
passed
this
not
thinking
it
was
fair?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
specifically
doesn't
address
whether
a
cause
of
action
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
mean
for
prejudgment
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
against
anybody.
it
doesn't
address
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
leads
into
a
question
that
i
had,
mr.
hungar.
you
argue
in
your
brief,
and
i
suppose
you
were
about
to
argue
it
here
before
you
got
interrupted,
that
we
should
defer
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
if
we're
talking
here
about
a
cause
of
action,
a
judicially
created
cause
of
action
as
you
have
just
said
for
the
interest,
do
we
listen
to
the
agencies
as
to
whether,
for
example,
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
the
securities
law?
we
don't
listen
to
the
agencies
as
to
whether
there's
a
judicial
cause
of
action,
so
what
difference
does
it
make
what
the
agencies
think
here?
we're
talking
about
where
there's
a
cause
of
action
in
the
courts.
isn't
that
our
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
care
what
you
want
to
call
it,
it's
judicially
created.
that's
the
point,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
have
said
that.
that
has
been
your
argument
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
do
they
implement
the
act
or
do
the
courts
implement
the
act?
you
just
told
us
that
the
courts
implement
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
these
other
cases
that
you
refer
to,
if
the
act
does
apply
the
agency
has
some
responsibilities,
as
an
agency,
as
an
administrative
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
case
if
the
act
does
apply
the
only
consequence
is
that
the
court
shall
pronounce
a
judgment
of
a
certain
sort.
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
this
is
court's
business,
it
seems
to
me,
not
agencies'
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
todd,
excuse
me,
before
you
go
further.
how
many
of
those
sections
that
you
referred
to
that
the
state
wasn't
excluded
from,
how
many
of
those
sections
are
part
of
the
debt
collection
act?
how
many
sections
other
than
3716
and
3717?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
were
all
enacted
at
the
same
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
tax
refunds,
mr.
todd?
i
don't
get
interest
from
the
government
on
my
tax
refunds.
i
suppose
that's
a
debt
the
government
owes
me,
isn't
it,
when
i
have
overpaid
my
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
get
the
money
back.
i
don't
get
interest
on
it,
do
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it's
a
matter...
i
don't
understand
your
point.
your
point
is
if
it's
a
matter
of
law
it
can't
be,
we
don't
owe
any
deference
to
agencies?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
whether
the
statute
is
retroactive?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
close
at
all.
we
would
defer
to
epa.
of
course
we
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
says
in
this
specialized
area
of
debt
collection,
read
3717.
the
head
of
an
executive
or
legislative
agency
shall
charge
a
minimum
rate
of
interest,
blah,
blah,
blah.
i
mean,
the
agency
heads
have
to
know
how
to
operate.
are
they
supposed
to
charge
rates
pursuant
to
the
debt
collection
act
or
are
they
supposed
to
charge
rates
pursuant
to
the
old
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
government
has
to
know
something.
i
mean,
the
government
has
to
bill
you
something
if
there
is
interest
owing,
right,
because
it
wouldn't
know
whether
the
debt
has
been
fulfilled
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
had
the
practice
been?
do
you
know
what
the
practice
had
been?
i
mean,
surely
there
have
been
debts
owing
from
the
states
to
the
federal
government
in
various
contexts
from
day
one.
