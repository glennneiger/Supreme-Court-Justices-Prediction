if
the
state
had
just
refused
to
pay,
mr.
hungar,
and
the
united
states
had
sued
the
state,
which
was
not
the
case
here,
would
it
have
had
a
choice
to
proceed
under
the
federal
common
law
or
under
the
debt
collection
act,
or
does
the
debt
collection
act
not
provide
some
substantial
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
for
the
substantive
amount
owed,
for
the
principal
amount
owed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
there's
no
substantive
liability
under...
substantive
cause
of
action
created
under
the
debt
collection
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
the
principal
sum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the...
and
is
that
the
common
law
cause
of
action
that
the
united
states
would
proceed
under
in
this
hypothetical
case
where
the
united
states
is
initiating
the
suit?
would
the
united
states
then
have
a
choice
to
say
well,
we'll
proceed
under
the
statutory
cause
of
action
or
under
the
federal
common
law,
or
are
they
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
in
the
hypothetical
case
you
had
proceeded
under
the
statutory
authority
to
collect
the
money,
the
debt
collection
act
is
still
not
applicable
insofar
as
prejudgment
interest
is
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
is
the
meaning
in
4
c.f.r.
102.13
subparagraph
(2)
on
debts
which
are
not
subject
to
31
u.s.c.
3717?
it
says
however
agencies
are
authorized
to
assess
interest
and
related
charges
on
debts
which
are
not
subject
to
31
u.s.c.
3717.
is
that
a
way
of
saying
debts
owed
by
state
or
local
governments,
or
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
all
it
includes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
regulation
at
4a
of
your
brief,
and
i'm
just
not
sure
what
debts
are
included
in
the
phrase
debts
which
are
not
subject
to
3717.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
says
they
are
just
not
subject
to
3717.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
state
had
refused
to
pay
and
the
government
instituted
suit,
would
the
government
have
a
choice
to
say
we're
proceeding
under
the
common
law
or
we're
proceeding
under
the
statute?
and
if
so
would
the
choice
make
any
difference
so
far
as
the
debt
collection
act?
