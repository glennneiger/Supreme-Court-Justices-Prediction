mr.
james
c.
todd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
resolution
of
this
dispute
has
to
begin
and
return
to
the
observation
that
the
debt
collection
act
unambiguously
excludes
states
from
the
category
of
persons
from
whom
a
federal
agency
may
seek
to
collect
a
debt.
that's
important
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
act
does
apply
to
states.
it's
only
two
sections
that
are
taken
out
and
removed
as
not
applying
to
states.
3701(c)
says
that
for
purposes
of
sections
3716
and
3717
the
state
is
not
a
person,
obviously
leaving
the
state
a
person
for
every
other
section.
so
it's
not
a
case
in
which
congress
has
simply
chosen
not
to
address
the
states
at
all.
secondly,
the
debt
collection
act
comprehensively
addresses
the
question
of
prelitigation
debt
collection.
in
fact
what
the
debt--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
all
of
the
others.
an
agency
still
is
mandated
to
seek
to
collect
a
debt
which
the
state
owes
the
federal
government.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
and
all
these
other
sections
deal
with
the
procedures,
the
safeguards,
and
so
forth.
now--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes...
not
all.
before
1982
there
was
what
was
called
the
federal
claims
collection
act
of
1966,
and
some
of
these
provisions,
some
parts
of
3701
and
3702,
and
as
mr.
hungar
just
mentioned,
3714,
were
in
that
preexisting.
what
the
debt
collection
act
did
was
greatly
expand
the
scope
and
really
limit
the
discretion.
one
of
the
most
important
things
it
did
was
to
reduce
the
discretion
of
federal
agencies
as
to
whether
to
seek
debt,
as
to
when
to
seek
debt,
as
to
how
to
seek
debt
collection,
and
from
whom.
now,
it
happens
that
in
3701(c)
as
to
administrative
offsets
and
charging
interest,
congress
removed
discretion
altogether
from
the
federal
agencies.
but
the...
as
has
been
brought
out
by
questioning
previously,
we
have
a
confusion
here
of
two
different
points
at
which
interest
may
be
sought.
the
debt
collection
act
deals
with
prelitigation
debt
collection.
in
fact
the
original
caption
back
in
the
federal
claims
collection
act
said
in
order
to
avoid
unnecessary
litigation
the
following
procedures
are
enacted.
in
prelitigation
assessing
interest,
asking
the
state
to
pay
interest,
that's
what
the
states
have
been
removed
from.
now
it's
interesting
to
look
at
this
case
and
see
how
this
putative
common
law
authority
was
exercised.
you'll
see
in
the
joint
appendix,
starting
around
page
6,
the
notice
letters
which
the
secretary
of
agriculture
sent,
really
making
a
demand
on
the
state.
it
calculates
a
very
precise
interest,
7.625
percent,
and
it
says
that
that's
based
on
regulation
102.11.
102.11
then
refers
to
102.13,
which
is
the
one
mr.
hungar
was
discussing.
that
102.13
incorporates
almost
verbatim
the
provisions
of
3717.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
secretary
of
agriculture
treated
the
texas
department
of
human
services
exactly
the
way
the
state
would
have
been
treated
if
3717
had
been
made
by
congress
to
apply
to
the
states.
so
the
effect
of
allowing
this
putative
common
law
right
is
to
read
right
back
into
the
prelitigation
debt
collection
process
exactly
the
coverage
of
the
state,
local,
and
federal
government
which
congress
excluded.
there
is
nothing--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
todd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
todd
right.
mr.
james
c.
todd
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
todd
okay.
in
that...
i
don't
know
about
in,
the
government's
position
is
internally
consistent.
i'm
saying
it's
inconsistent
with
the
scheme
that
congress
has
created.
the
common
law
right,
to
the
extent
it
attaches,
would
be
first
of
all
if
the
state
refused
to
pay
its
obligation
at
all.
that
triggers
a,
in
this
case
since
this
is
dealing
with
the
food
stamp
act
that
would
trigger
the
enforcement
provision
of
the
food
stamp
act
which
is
like
just
about
every
other
spending
clause
federal
funds
in
return
for
compliance
statute.
that
is
if
the
secretary
finds
that
the
state
is
out
of
compliance
with
any
provision,
then
the
secretary
can
do
two
things,
cut
off
federal
funds
or,
two,
refer
it
to
the
justice
department
for
an
enforcement
action.
now,
in
that
enforcement
action
the
justice
department
retains
the
right
to
seek
remedies
from
a
federal
court.
but
we're
not
at
that
stage--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
the
inconsistency
is
in
using...
the
inconsistency
i'm
talking
about
is
an
inconsistency
with
the
exclusion
of
states
from
the
prelitigation
debt
collection
activity.
in
other
words
now
the
debt
collection
act
is
the
consistent
uniform
set
of
rules
for
how
every,
and
it
says
every
agency
of
the
united
states
government
is
to
go
about
prelitigation,
making,
assessing
interest,
making
a
claim,
seeking--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--right.
right.
if,
let's
say
as
to
a
debtor,
an
obligor,
that
the
debt
collection
act
authorizes
a
federal
agency
to
seek
repayment
from,
let's
say
a
student
loan,
a
student
won't
repay
a
loan,
then
the
agency
may
assess
the
interest.
and
there
is
a
formula
for
how
they
assess
it,
it
has
to
do
with
treasury
rates,
rates
on
treasury
notes.
and
then
if
they
have
to
turn
it
over
to
the
justice
department
and
the
justice
department
goes
to
court
then
they
recover
not
only
the
interest
but
there
are
some
other
penalties
that
go
along
with
losing
litigation.
what
congress
has
exempted
the
states
from
is
this
authority
to
assess
interest
and
to
seek
to
collect,
to
seek
to
collect
interest
as
part
of
the
debt
collection.
agencies
are,
let
me
repeat,
agencies
are
still,
federal
agencies
under
the
statute
are
still
obligated
to
seek
to
collect
any
debt
that
the
state
of
texas
owes
the
federal
government.
so
states
are
not
out
of
this
statute
altogether.
mr.
james
c.
todd
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
government's
choice
would
be
to
proceed
under
common
law.
i
think
it
would
be
bound
to
proceed
under
the
specific
enforcement
provision
of
the
statute,
and
for
the
reasons
that
i
want
to
discuss
in
detail
as
to
how
a
statute
displaces
common
law.
once
the
justice
department
is
in
court
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
in
litigation
with
the
state,
it
has
available
under
its
authority
an
arsenal
of
remedies
or
tools
that
it
can
use
which
hasn't
really
been
a
subject
of
this
litigation
thus
far.
i
think
the
city
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois
case
in
'81,
and
it
sort
of
was
a
companion
case
to
northwestern
airlines
v.
national
transport
union,
are
two
cases
which
really
clarify
and
remind
litigants
of
the
proper
scope
of
federal
common
law
when
there
has
been
a
particular
statute.
and
i
think
that's
a
good
starting
point
for
analysis
to
then
take
a
look
and
see
what
the
debt
collection
act
has
done.
that
case
reminded
litigants
that
federal
common
law
is
not
like
the
common
law,
the
body
of
common
law
that
the
state
courts
by
and
large
have
developed.
it's
called
common
law
because
judges
use
a
common
law
type
of
decision
making
process,
but
it's
a
limited
stop
gap
measure.
it
only
arises
in
the
situation
where
the
federal
court
needs
to
make
a
decision
on
a
question,
there
is
no
federal
statute
to
guide
it,
and
it's
not
appropriate
to
look
to
state
common
law.
in
those
limited
instances
then
the
federal
courts
can
fashion
a
sort
of
common
law.
but
as
city
of
milwaukee
said,
as
soon
as
congress
has
directly
addressed
the
question
covered
by
the
common
law,
then
the
need
for
the
common
law
disappears.
so
that
begs
the
question
what
does
it
take
for
congress
to
directly
address
a
question.
the
decision
goes
on
again,
this
is
really
a
reminder
of
what
had
been
the
law
all
along.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
expressly
by
this
statute
we
intend
to
displace
federal
common
law.
in
fact
in
none
of
the
briefs
in
this
case,
in
none
of
the
circuit
decisions,
there
are
about
6
circuits
that
have
addressed
the
question
that
we're
here
talking
about
today,
has
anybody
cited
an
example
of
a
statute
where
congress
has
expressly
said
by
this
statute
congress
hereby
abrogates
common
law.
now
congress
does
have
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
in
other
contexts,
like
for
example
to
abrogate
a
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
when
it
creates
a
private
right
of
action.
it
has
to
say,
and
this
court
has
told
congress
it
has
to
say
this
abrogates
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that,
according
to
city
of
milwaukee
and
cases
since
then,
when
it's
displacing
common
law.
it
doesn't
owe
federal
common
law
the
same
deference
it
owes
state
common
law,
and
it
doesn't
take
as
much
as
it
does
to
preempt
state
law
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
and
yet
a
number
of
statutes
can
preempt
state
law
without
saying
so.
to
look
and
see
whether
it
has
directly
addressed
the
question,
this
city
of
milwaukee,
and
another
helpful
case
is
united
states
v.
fausto,
said
you
look
at
the,
not
only
the
purpose
of
the
statute
but
its
scope
and
the
structure
of
its
remedial
scheme.
now
as
to
the
purpose,
obviously
3701(c)
is
an
exception.
it
is
an
exception,
so
in
a
sense
you
can
say
any
time
a
statute
makes
an
exception,
having
made
a
broad
across
the
board
rule,
any
time
it
comes
back
and
says
but
we
except,
we
exclude
these
categories,
you
can
say
that's
contrary
to
the
purpose,
but
it
isn't
really
in
this
case.
it's
not
at
all
unusual
for
congress
to
choose
to
treat
one
class
of
debtors
differently,
governmental
parties
differently
from
others.
and
what
congress
has
done
in
3701(c)
is
consciously
choose
to
treat
governmental
debtors
differently
from
other
debtors.
for
example,
under
this
food
stamps
act,
if
grocer
submits
food
stamps
to
the
federal
government
for
reimbursement
at
face
value
and
the
federal
government
delays
in
repaying,
it
doesn't
have
to
pay
interest.
it's
very
common
to
find
that
governments
don't
have
to
pay
interest.
what
you
have
as
a
countervailing
incentive,
disincentive
to
the
state
to
unreasonably
delay
is
a
unique
sort
of
relationship
which
state
agencies
have
with
their
federal
funding
agencies
that
the
ordinary
debtor
doesn't
have
to
a
creditor.
the
texas
department
of
human
resources,
services,
excuse
me,
receives
federal
funding
from
agriculture
and
health
and
human
services.
under
those
funding
statutes
the
secretary
has
broad
discretion
to
determine
that
the
state
is
out
of
compliance
and
cut
off
funds.
no
state
agency
wants
to
engender
ill
will
with
the
federal
funding
agency,
so
you
have
some
assurance
that
states
are
not
simply
going
to
default.
the
only
incentive--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--that's
right,
in
this...
they
are
not
entitled
to
do
what
the
secretary
did
here,
which
is
present
a
demand
to
the
state
for
interest.
mr.
james
c.
todd
yes,
and
it's
typically
in
a
governmental
context.
the
debt
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
delayed
payment,
but
the
obligation--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--right.
well,
typically
the
federal
government
doesn't
owe
interest
when
it
is
late
in
paying
funds
that
it
owes,
and
actually
most
of
the
traffic
of
money
is
from
federal
government
to
the
states
rather
than
vice-versa,
and
usually--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--it's
rare
or
non-existent
in
the
usual
debtor-creditor,
outside
the
governmental
context.
mr.
james
c.
todd
the...
i'm
not
sure
of
all
the
situations
outside
the
social
service
area
where
the
federal
government
might
be
a
debtor
to
the
states,
but
i
don't
know
of...
i
think
that
this
is,
i
think
this
is
the
situation
that
has
been
created.
i
can't
give
you
an
exact
amount--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes,
sir.
right.
mr.
james
c.
todd
i
would
agree
that
that's
an
instance
in
which
a
governmental
entity
does
not
pay
interest
and
whereas
another,
someone
else
who
has
an
obligation
to
pay
somebody
back
in
which
there
has
been
an
overpayment.
and
this
is
sort
of
that
sort
of
situation.
under
the
food
stamps
act
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
money
has
been
paid
which
the
government
should
not
have
had
to
pay,
and
therefore
the
state
of
texas
should
refund
or
reimburse
the
federal
government
a
portion
of
that
money
which
the
federal
government
should
not
have
had
to
pay.
and
so
it's
a
similar
sort
of
situation.
congress
has
chosen,
has
made
a
very
obvious
policy
choice
that
governmental
debtors,
including...
and
by
the
way
that
3701(c)
includes
the
united
states
government
as
well,
and
subchapter
3
of
the
debt
collection
act
are
claims
against
the
united
states.
so
it
runs
both
ways.
as
to
the
deference
that
would
be
due
to
the
interpretation
by
these
federal
agencies,
i
think
that
the
case
which
answers
the
question
that
took
place
in
the
dialogue
earlier
is
securities
and
exchange
commission
v.
the
chenery
corporation,
which
i
think
both
parties
have
cited
in
their
briefs.
in
that
case
the
sec
wanted
to
penalize
the
managers
during
reorganization
of
a
corporation
for
having
purchased
preferred
stock
in
the
reorganized
corporation.
they
relied
for
that
ruling
not
on
their
specialized
expertise
that
had
been
delegated
to
them
by
congress
of
stock
transaction,
but
the
sec's
understanding
of
general
principles
of
equity.
what
the
court
said
was
fine,
in
the
usual
situation
where
an
agency's
ruling
or
decision
or
interpretation
is
in
an
area
of
law
delegated
to
it
by
congress
and
in
which
it
has
specialized
expertise
we
defer,
but
when
the
agency
is
purporting
to
rely
on
judicial
doctrines,
then
a
court
can
and
should
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
agency.
it's
very
clear
in
this
case,
in
fact
the
best
indication
of
it
is
in
the
government's
brief.
i
think
around
page
21
they
discuss,
the
comptroller
specifically
considered
whether
common
law
applied
and
decided
that
the
common
laws
in
force.
now
they're
relying
not
on
something
that's
within
the
specialized
expertise
of
the
comptroller
general,
now
what
the
government
is
doing
is
giving
its
understanding
of
when
common
law
retains
viability
in
the
face
of
an
explicit
statute,
and
that
of
course
is
a
matter
of
judicial
doctrine
and
i
think
that
the
same
deference
would
not
be
due.
if
the
government's
reasoning--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
not
just
any
law.
if
it's
a
matter
of
that
portion
of
law
which
are
judicial
doctrines,
such
as
principles
of
equity,
such
as
the
general
principle
of
when
common
law
retains
it
viability.
this
is
not,
for
example,
like...
let's
say
if
congress
passes
a
statute
controlling
the
manufacture
and
distribution
of
pesticides
and
the
environmental
protection
agency
says
this
is
what
we
think
the
statute
means
as
to
what
is
a
pesticide,
that
is
obviously
within
epa's
expertise.
if--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--that's
closer.
mr.
james
c.
todd
the
eeoc,
for
example,
a
number
of
circuits
have
deferred
to
eeoc...
when
the
statute
is
dealing
with
that...
there
you're
talking
about
whether
the
agency
is
asked
to
give
an
opinion
on
whether
or
not
in
this
specialized
area
congress,
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--the
statute
has
already
told
them
very
expressly
that
when
they
get
to
reading
3717
any
place
that
it
says
person
it
doesn't
include
state,
so
their
mandate
to
seek
to
collect
debts
owed
by
the
states
are
covered
by
the
rest
of
the
statute,
but
they
don't...
that
doesn't
take,
that
part
doesn't
take
constructing
the
statute,
because
the
statute
has
already
said
don't
look
inside
the
statute
for
interest
against
states.
so
you
have
to
go
totally
outside
the
statute
to
common
law.
now,
common
law,
the
federal
common
law
is
a
species
of
law
fashioned
by
the
judiciary
on
what
sec
v.
chenery
called
established
judicial
doctrines.
and
so
the
agency
really
in
effect
is
not
interpreting
the
statute,
it's
interpreting
common
law.
mr.
james
c.
todd
well,
i
would
say
that...
what
i
would
say
is
this.
i
would
think
the
court
would
wind
up
agreeing
with
the
department
of
justice,
not
because
when
in
that
instance
the
department
of
justice
is
dealing
with
something
within
its
specialized
expertise
but
because
they
got
it
right
if
they
had
come
out--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--not
as
a...
right.
my
answer
to
your
question
is
you
would
not
reach
the
result
of
concurring
as
a
result
of
deference.
you
would
reach
the
result
of
concurring
because
their
conclusion--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--if
you
conclude,
and
i'll
try
to
again
answer
this
question--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--on
matters
of
common
law
and
established
judicial
doctrine,
the
court
is
a
much
greater--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
but
that's
what,
the
construction
of
a
statute
i
think
stops
with
3701(c).
the
states
are
out
of
it.
and
the
government
itself
doesn't,
is
not
in
here
today
saying
we
have
authority
under
the
debt
collection
act
to
charge
this
interest.
so
they're
not
construing
the
statute.
they're
here
to
say
we
have
authority
under
preexisting
common
law
to
seek
this
interest.
so
the
conclusion
that
results
in
this
regulation
102.13
results
from
their
understanding
of
the
judicially
fashioned
federal
common
law,
and
particularly
since
the
federal
common
law--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--they
are
entitled
to
opine,
and
i
think,
and
i'll
go
so
far
as
to
agree
with
mr.
hungar
that
they
have
some
duty
here
to
make
a
call
because
they
have
to
give
guidance
to
their
clients
as
to
what
they
should
do,
but
the
conclusion
of
that
opining
is
not
due
the
same
deference
that
it
would
be
if,
as
in
the
example
i
gave,
the
epa
saying
what
is
a
pesticide.
mr.
james
c.
todd
i
think
it
is
due...
well,
is
it
due
any?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
it's
due
some,
and
i
don't
know
how
to
calibrate
it
so
i
can
say
how
you
measure
weight.
mr.
james
c.
todd
if
you
conclude,
your
honor,
if
the
court
concludes
that
this
is
a
very,
very
close
call
and
it's
extremely
unclear,
and
furthermore
that
this
is
an
agency
which
has
traditionally
exercised
this
common
law
right,
then
the
deference
is
greater
than
what
i
am
suggesting
is
actually
the
situation
where
the
statute
has
been,
first
where
the
statute
has...
first
of
all
comprehensively
addressed
the
situation
of
prelitigation
debt
collection,
seeking
to
collect
debt.
and
it's,
i
think
it's
all
encompassing
in
that
regard,
as
the
court
found
the
federal
water
pollution
act
to
be
with
regard
to
discharges.
it
applies
to
every
federal
agency.
it
sets
the,
it
makes
every
federal
agency
have
the
same
policy
and
the
same
procedure
and
give
the
same
priority
to
seeking
to
collect
debts
owed
to
the
united
states
as
every
other
agency,
which
was
not
the
situation
previously.
so
it's
pretty
comprehensive
in
that
sphere.
having
occupied
that
sphere,
congress
made
a
judgment...
now,
the
legislative
history
won't
tell
you
the
articulated
reasons
because
this
was
added
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
after
the
bill
came
there.
all
we
have
is
the
post-enactment
statement,
so
we
have
to...
but
you
can
see
by
the
mechanics
of
the
statute
they
had
to,
this
had
to
have
been
deliberate
to
say,
to
add
a
subsection
to
the
definitions
section
to
say
that
persons
in
3716
and
3717
doesn't
include
states.
that
had
to
be
very
conscious.
as
to
the
utility
of
leaving
in
place
the,
quote,
discretionary
and
flexible
type
of
common
law
interest
as
some
sort
of
a
supplement
to
the
act
while
removing
states
from
the
mandatory
provisions,
i'll
just
return
to
the
point
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
agency
has
applied
its
putative
common
law
authority
to
the
state
of
texas
exactly
the
way
3717
would
have
been
applied.
they
have
sent
the
same
kind
of
notice,
they
have
started
the
interest
accruing
at
the
same
point,
30
days,
and
they
have
used
exactly
the
same
formula
to
compute
the
rate.
so
from
our
standpoint
it's
the
same.
it
winds
up
having
the
same--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
todd
that
would
be
the
way
it
would,
if
they
have
to
have,
if
they
have
to
charge
interest
i
would
say
that,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
the
one
thing
that
distinguishes
the
relationship
of
the
federal
recipient
agency
with
the
federal
funding
agency
from
other
types
of
creditor-debtor
relations
is
this
ongoing
relationship
that
they
have
and
the
need
that
they
have
to
maintain
good
relations
with
the...
the
states
are
simply
not
defaulting
on
their
debts,
and
this
is
clear
from
the
senate
report
97-378
which
both
parties
have
cited.
when
you
look
at
what
congress
found
as
to
who
is
deficient
and
who
is
not,
they're
really
not
talking
about
a
big
problem
with
states.
states
are
obviously
some
part
of
the
problem,
but
they're
not
a
big
problem.
so
congress
could
very
well
decide
let's
remove
discretion
with
regard
to
the
states
and
focus
the
federal
agencies
on
going
in
a
more
aggressive
manner
after
the
debt
which
the
others
have
owed.
i
believe
this
discussion
covers
the
really
major
points
and
major
cases.
i
would
reemphasize--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
todd
not
explicitly.
from
united
states
v.
west
virginia
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
1939,
board
of
commissioners
v.
the
united
states.
that
was
really
a
suit
against
a
county,
and
although
the
united
states
brought
it,
the
united
states
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
really
bringing
it
on
behalf
of
a
native
american,
and
really
the
outcome
of
that
case
was
based
on
the
fact
that
really
the
united
states
government's
position
there
was
equivalent
to
any
other
individual
who
was
due
a
tax
refund.
so
the
united
states,
although
it's
implicit
if
the
federal
government
can
sue
a
county,
and
although
they
didn't
get
interest
in
board
of
commissioners
it
apparently
was
one
of
their
remedies,
you
might
say
it's
implicit,
but
really
west
virginia
v.
united
states
in
1987
is
the
first
time
it
was
said
expressly.
mr.
james
c.
todd
right.
it
was
on,
the
very
last
footnote
of
that
decision,
42,
says
the
debt
that
was
being
sued
upon,
the
obligation
that
was
being
sued
upon
arose
before
october
1982
and
therefore
it
just
was
included.
thank
you
very
much.
