h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-1729,
united
states
v.
texas.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
if
an
agency
under
the
regulation
says
we
think
prejudgment
interest
should
occur
at
the
rate
of
8
percent
from
the
time
they
got
notice
of
the
debt?
does
the
district
court,
assuming
that
it
says
we're
going
to
follow
the
common
law,
does
it
have
to
defer
to
the
agency's
recommendation
as
to
the
rate
of
interest
or
the
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
todd,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
congress
excluded--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--congress
excluded
the
states
from
the
application
of
3716
and
3717.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
leaves
the
common
law
remedies
in
existence
as
they
were
before
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
there's
something
inconsistent
with
the
government's
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
haven't
yet
gotten
to
the
inconsistency,
have
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
prelitigation,
but
certainly
it
has
application
considerably
beyond
prelitigation.
it
specifies
rates
of
interest
that
may
be
recovered
by
the
government
if
it
goes
to
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position,
then,
mr.
todd,
is
that
the
correct
reading
of
the
debt
collection
act
is
that
the
federal
government
is
not
entitled
to
claim
any
interest
against
the
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
quite
a
remarkable
result,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
is
there
any
other
situation
in
which
a
debtor
is
not,
a
creditor
is
not
entitled
to
any
sort
of
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
of
lots
of
debts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
when
the
federal
government
is
a
grantor
and
doesn't
pay
the
grant
on
time,
that's
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
a
debt
or
someone
who
is
the
recipient
of
an
overpayment
who
is
obligated
to
repay
it.
i'm
asking
you
for
an
analogous
situation
where
someone
who
is
clearly
a
debtor,
as
one
understands
that
situation
from
law
school,
not
having
to
pay
any
sort
of
interest
on
the
debt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
governmental
context
where
does
it
exist?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
an
agency
would
not,
is
not
entitled
to
opine
as
to
whether
the
debt
collection
act
left
that
common
law
intact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
due
any
deference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
todd.
mr.
hungar,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
the
case
is
submitted.
