justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
hungar,
in
cases
in
which
the
common
law
remedy
is
applied,
when
does
the
interest
run
from?
is
it
the
date
of
the
complaint?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
the
court
assess
it
as
of
a
date
earlier
than
the
date
of
the
complaint?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
there's
no
discretion
under
the
act,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
state
of
texas
i
take
it
then
in
your
view
is
wrong
in
what
it
said
in
its
brief
on,
i
think
it
was
on
page
12,
that
what
the
government
is
asking
for
here
in
fact
is
the
same
interest
remedy
that
it
would
have
had
under
the
act.
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
remedy,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
see
the
common
law
remedy
as
essentially
a
discretionary
judicial
remedy
as
distinct
from
something
which
is
implicit
in
a
contractual
relationship?
i
assume
the
answer
is
yes,
it's
a
judicial
remedy.
there's
nothing
contractual
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
hungar,
does
the
regulation
that
we
have
just
been
discussing
have
a
mistake
in
it
in
its
statement
that
agencies
are
authorized
to
assess
interest
as
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
with
the
common
law?
because
i
thought
you
told
me
that
that
was
a
judicial
remedy,
so
that
the
agencies
wouldn't
be
assessing
it,
they
would
simply
be
asking
a
court
for
it
if
they
won
their
legal
actions
for
collection.
and
yet
this
seems,
this
definitely
says
that
the
agencies
can
assess.
is
that
a
mistake?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
means
they
have
to
go
to
courts
for
enforcement
just
as
they
have
to
go
to
courts
to
enforce
the
underlying
debt
in
the
first
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
regulation
seems
to
say
that,
subject
to
whatever
enforcement
discretion
a
court
may
have,
the
agency
has
the
common
law
authority
to
create
an
obligation,
and
i
didn't
think
that's
what
you
were
saying
before.
