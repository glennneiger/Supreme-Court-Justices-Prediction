mr.
hungar,
when
you
call
our
attention
to
the
regulation,
wouldn't
it
have
been
natural
for
congress
if
they
meant
what
you
say
to
have
done
exactly
what
the
author
of
the
regulations
did,
at
the
end
of
subsection
(c)
to
say
however,
agencies
are
authorized
to
continue
to
apply
the
common
law
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
must
admit
though
it
would
have
been
rather
clearer
had
they
done
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
case
like
this
one
where
your
rule
applied
to
preserving
a
common
law
rule
when
a
new
statute
has
been,
replace
the
general
scheme
of
things?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
didn't
create
a
new
remedy
is
what
that
did.
that
didn't
abrogate
any
remedy,
the
statute
there,
any
preexisting
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
your
strongest
case,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
again
to
the
text
of
the
regulation
that
justice
souter
called
your
attention
to,
that
they
are
authorized
to
assess
interest
on
debts
not
subject
to
3717
to
the
extent
authorized
under
the
common
law.
i
would
have
read
that
to
mean
to
the
extent
that
agencies
are
authorized
under
the
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
do
read
it
literally,
just
looking
at
this
text,
to
the
extent
authorized
under
common
law
would
mean
not
authorized
at
all,
ergo
the
regulation
would
forbid
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
would
have
to
know
what
the
agencies
were
authorized
to
do
under
common
law
to
answer
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
now
know
under
common
law
agencies
have
no
power
just
to
assess
interest
willy-nilly,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
deference
is
due
if
we
think
congress
delegated
to
the
agency
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
which
way
to
go,
and
you
think
there's
something
in
the
statute
that
suggests
congress
wanted
the
agencies
to
decide
whether
the
common
law
rule
should
survive
or
not.
it's
rather
a
strange
kind
of
delegation
of
decision
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
they
authorized
to
make
decisions
as
to
whether
the
common
law
rule
survives
the
amendment
of
the
statute
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
closest
case
of
agency
delegation
to
this
one?
surely
it's
a
mile
away
from
chevron,
100
miles
away
from
chevron.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
background
question
i
should
know,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--prior
to
west
virginia
against
the
united
states
had
we
ever
held
that
a
state
is
liable
to
the
federal
government
for
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
after
the
debt
collection
act
was
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
there
was
a
case
other
than
the
one
that
your
opponent
mentioned
before
west
virginia
which
squarely
recognized
the
common
law
rule
that
you
rely
on?
