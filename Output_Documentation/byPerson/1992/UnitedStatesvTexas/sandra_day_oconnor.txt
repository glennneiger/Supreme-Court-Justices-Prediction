mr.
hungar...
i'm
sorry.
if
you're
correct,
mr.
hungar,
and
there
still
exists
this
common
law
right
to
recover
prejudgment
interest,
are
any
of
the
state's
other
arguments
open
for
consideration
on
remand?

well,
i
think
they
have
also
made
arguments
that
go
to,
that
are
equitable
in
nature,
i
suppose,
the
fact
that
the
government's
own
agent
stole
food
stamps
and
things
of
that
sort.
