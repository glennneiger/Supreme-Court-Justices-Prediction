justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
case
just
to
get
it
fixed
in
my
mind?
if
you
win,
what
it
means
is
the
period
of
redemption
has
not
yet
expired--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
therefore
your
client
has
a
right
to
redeem,
and
i
gather
your
position
is
he
will
retain
that
right
to
redeem
as
long
as
he
remains
on
active
duty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
he
just
has
the
right
to
redeem
as
of
now,
so
he
could
be
compelled
to
exercise
it
within
a
fixed
period
of
time,
could
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
have
to
make
a
tender
of
the
back
taxes
plus
interest,
whatever
the
statute
provides
for
redemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
had
a
person...
you
don't,
as
i
understand
it...
who
was
still
on
active
duty
and
he's
perhaps
going
to
serve
another
15,
20
years,
would
he
have
the
right
under
the
statute,
under
your
view,
to
say
to
the
property
owner,
i
haven't
decided
what
i
want
to
do.
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
period
of
redemption
hasn't
run
yet,
and
i'll
make
up
my
mind
just
before
i
get
out
of
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
sue
for
the
back
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
the
practical
matter
is
he
might
well
be
willing
to
sell
the
property
for
a
sum.
he
might
well
be
willing
to
sell
his
right
in
the
redemption
period
for
a
cash
sum.
these
things
often
settle
for
a
cash
basis--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
longer
the
period,
the
more
of
a
nuisance
rights
he
has,
the
better
bargaining
position
he
is
in
in
that
negotiation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
bring
discredit
on
the
armed
forces
to
exercise
rights
granted
by
congress
to
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army?
justice
john
paul
stevens
help
me
with
just
one
thing,
though.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
greater
or
less,
but
560
deals
with
approval
of
the
sale,
whereas
525
deals
with
redemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
a
sale
has
taken
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
doesn't
challenge
the...
he
doesn't
say
there's
any
defect
in
the
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
gives
him
an
unlimited
period,
a
period...
a
time
to
redeem
as
long
as
he's
in
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
assume
we
were
in
a
wartime
situation,
would
your
reliance
on
560...
would
you
make
the
same
argument
based
on
560?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that
today.
i'm
saying,
would
you
make
the
560
argument
in
1943,
or
during
the
korean
conflict,
or
during
the
vietnam
conflict?
would
you
make
that
argument
at
those
times?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
get
our
support
for
510,
but
i
don't
see...
it
seems
to
me
they
are
totally
separate
arguments,
that's
my
problem
with
you.
the
510
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
is
one...
we
have
special
rules
during
wartime.
your
560
argument
is,
we
have
a
special...
that's
the
statute
we
should
look
at
rather
than
525.
what
if
we
were
really
at
all-out
war
right
now,
would
you...
i
would
think
your
560
would
still
trump
this
right
to
redeem...
on
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
say
temporary
suspension
of
such
legal
proceedings
as
will
prejudice
their
rights,
it
just
says
a
certain
category
that
might
prejudice
their
rights,
and
this
might.
i
mean,
this
is
a
category
of
temporary
suspensions,
and
this
category
is
a
category
which
may
prejudice
the
people
who
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't
say
he
has
to
prove
the
prejudice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
section
doesn't
define
litigation
rights.
it
just
explains
why
they
enacted
the
statute,
and
the
statute
was
to
provide
temporary
suspensions
in
a
category
of
cases
where
servicemen
might
be
prejudiced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
this
category,
they
might
be.
but
it
doesn't
say
they
have
to
prove
prejudice
to
win
in
the
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
how
you
fit
510
with
525.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
you
could
say
that
some
people
might
be
prejudiced
by
not
being
able
to
hire
a
lawyer
in
time
to
do
this
and
that
and
therefore
they
can't
file
a
lawsuit
right
away,
therefore
we'll
give
them
5
years
to
avoid
the
danger
of
that
prejudice.
they
get
the
5
years
whether
they
can
prove
prejudice
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
interest
rate
the
redeeming
party
has
to
pay
on
a
judgment
in
maine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
purchaser
with
the
quit
claim
deed
at
least
gets
his
money
back
plus
interest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
whatever
the
rate
might
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
maine,
it
involves
the
question
of
construing
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
and
the
question
is
whether
a
service
man
who
fail
to
pay
his
taxes
and
has
his
property
sold
foreclosure
was
entitled
to
benefit
of
the
act
which
would
enable
him
to
postponed
the
period
of
redemption
throughout
his
period
of
service.
the
maine
supreme
court
in
a
divided
opinion
held
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
statute
because
he
could
not
prove
that
the
service
had
caused
him
any
prejudice
with
regard
to
his
ability
to
pay
his
taxes,
and
felt
that
a
literal
reading
on
the
statute
which
provide
for
the
tolling
of
the
redemption
period
was
absurd
and
illogical.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
and
hold
that
the
statute
basically
means
what
it
says.
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
advances
largely
on
the
basis
of
legislative
history
and
fairness
and
apply
a
literal
construction
of
the
act.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
