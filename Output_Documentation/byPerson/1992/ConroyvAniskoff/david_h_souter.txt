justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
maine
does
not
have
the
authority
to
give
title
until
that
period
is
passed,
and
because
it
is
tolled
maine
therefore
can
never
give
even...
cannot
even
give
a
good
title
subject
to
defeasance
later.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
what
you
were
saying
to
justice
scalia,
and
i
thought
the
theory
that
you
were
espousing
was
that
because
the
period
of
service
is
not
included...
cannot
be
included
in
computing
the
redemption
period,
that
the
redemption
period
never
runs.
because
it
never
runs,
maine,
or
the
town,
whatever
it
is,
never
acquires
the
authority
to
give
any
title
at
all.
isn't
that
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
way
it
works,
on
your
view,
in
maine,
is
it?
