justice

r.
white
in
a
timely
fashion.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
your
conclusion
on
what
you've
just
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
this
had
happened
back
in
1942
or
'43?
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
should
say,
just
because
congress
has...
that
even
though
congress
has
not
changed
the
law,
we
should
apply
it
differently.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
what
the
law
says,
in
time
of
war.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
protection
that
seemingly
is
given
to
the
right
to
redeem
just
has
expired
by
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
do
you
find
the
requirement
for
the
hardship?
that's
the
real
problem.
congress
couldn't
specify
it
in
this
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
you
shouldn't
have
answered
that
if
this
had
happened
in
1943
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument.
you
would
say
well,
gee
whiz,
that
other
section
gives
the
most
protection,
and
so--
