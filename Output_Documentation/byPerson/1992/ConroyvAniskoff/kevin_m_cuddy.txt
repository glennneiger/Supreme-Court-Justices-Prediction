mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
here
today,
as
has
been
discussed,
is
the
statutory
foreclosure
by
the
town
of
danforth
on
170
acres
of
open
land
in
maine
for
unpaid
taxes,
and
the
subsequent
sale
of
these
lots
to
respondents
aniskoff
and
haynes.
as
has
been
stated,
the
former
owner,
mr.
conroy,
was
in
the
military
service
at
all
pertinent
times
here,
and
he
had
residences
in
south
portland,
maine,
and
also
in
wisconsin.
the
petitioner
here
contends
that
the
status...
the
uniformed
status
that
he
enjoyed
as
a
serviceman
shields
him
from
his
responsibilities
to
pay
taxes
because
of
section
525.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
in
a
timely
fashion,
your
honor,
yes.
thank
you.
we
contend
that
he
uses
that
status
as
a
sword,
really,
to
unfairly
inhibit
the
town
of
danforth
from
collecting
its
tax
revenue
and
to
unreasonably
deprive
good
faith
purchasers
of
title
in
the
real
estate.
we...
i
think
counsel
collectively
has
done
the
court
a
disservice,
apparently,
because
we
have
not
included
for
you
section
560,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
in
any
readily
available
form
so
that
you
can
look
at
it
right
now,
because
i
agree
with
these
gentlemen,
section
560
is
important.
not
having
any
expertise
in
this
when
this
case
was
brought
to
me,
i
looked
at
560,
because
it's
the
particular
section
that
seems
to
apply
here,
and
i
read
it
through,
and
i
checked
to
see,
did
this
fit
within
the
area
of
someone
who
owned
real
property
that
was
occupied
for
dwelling
purposes
or
professional
purposes
or
business
or
agriculture?
no.
it's
open
land.
it
doesn't
apply.
but
as
these
gentlemen
called
it
to
my
attention,
i
looked
at
that
subsection
(2).
that
subsection
(2)
of
section
560
indicates
that
the
court
must
be
asked
to
approve
a
tax
sale
if
a
tax
sale
takes
place
under
560
when
the
court
feels
that
the
military
service
did
not
materially
affect
the
ability
of
the
military
person
to
pay
tax.
the
court
will
approve
the
sale
if
it
feels
that
the
military
person's
ability
to
pay
tax
was
not
materially
affected
by
his
military
service.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
i
make
reference
to
it,
your
honor.
none
of
us,
unfortunately,
have
reprinted
the
statute
in
its
entirety
in
any
of
our
briefs
or
any
of
our
appendices.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
i
fully
appreciate
that,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
on
my
behalf--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--my
conclusion,
your
honor,
moving
forward
from
that
point,
is
that
this
court
in
the
lemaistre
case
back
in
1948,
which
in
the
last
46
years
is
the
only
case
which
dealt
with
this
section...
back
in
1948,
this
court
said,
with
respect
to
section
560,
560
and
525
supplement
each
other,
and
560
gives
greater
protection...
greater
protection
than
525.
what
the
petitioner
is
suggesting
is
in
fact
because
of
his
military
status
as
a
service
person
525
gives
him
absolute
protection.
this
court
has
already
gone
on
record
indicating
in
lemaistre
that
it
is
560,
the
particular
section,
that
gives
the
preferred
position,
the
greater
protection,
to
the
serviceman.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
525
deals
with
redemption
periods.
560--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--right.
560
deals
with
a
sale
if
there
is
in
fact
a
tax
deficiency
and
the
mechanics
for
doing
it,
and
in
560
there's
a
reference
to
the
remedies
from
section
501
to
section
590,
which
includes
525.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
no.
no,
he
doesn't
say
there's
any
defect
in
the
sale.
he
says
that
525
gives
him
a
preferred
position
because
of
his
status
as
a
serviceman.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
and
section
510
of
the
act...
and
this
is
troublesome
to
me,
and
maybe
i'm
missing
this.
this
was
enacted
in
1918,
initially,
during
a
time
of
war.
it's
reenacted,
this
statute,
in
1940
during
a
time
of
war.
it's
interpreted
in
1948,
just
after
the
war,
by
this
court
in
lemaistre.
we're
now
looking
at
it
48
years
later,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioner
is
saying
we
should
look
at
it
with
blinders
on,
that
we
should
not
look
at
section
510,
which
is
a
statement
of
general
purposes,
that
we
should
not
look
at
the
exigent
circumstances
referred
to
in
section
510,
that
we
should
not
look
to
the
prejudice
that
section
510
suggests
has
to
exist.
we
shouldn't
look
at
any
of
those
things.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
courts...
the
lower
courts,
the
courts
in
florida,
the
courts
in
new
mexico
that
we
cited
in
our
brief--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--you're
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
no.
i
think
what
you
have
to
say,
your
honor,
is,
in
1942
and
'43
and
'44
and
'45,
there
was
a
war.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
that's...
that's
the
significant
fact.
in
1948,
in
its
wisdom,
congress--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--it
says,
exigent
circumstances,
and
one
has
to
infer
historically
what
those
exigent
circumstances
were.
you're
right,
that's
not
what
it
says.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
no,
it
doesn't
say
that.
clearly,
historically,
back
in
1940,
they
had
a
precedent
in
1918
that
it
was
only
enforced
as
long
as
the
exigent
circumstances
existed.
here,
in
1948,
congress
elected
to
continue
it
without
providing
any
sort
of
transition
to
answer
or
address
any
of
these
questions.
there
is
no
transition
for
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
i
want...
i'm
requesting
respectfully
that
you
interpret
this
statute
in
the
context
in
which
it
exists.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
it
has
expired
unless
there
is
prejudice
or
hardship,
and
where
does
one
find
the
prejudice
and
hardship
requirement--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
you
find
that
requirement
in
two
places.
number
1,
you
find
it
in
the
general
provisions,
section
510,
and
the
second
place
that
you
find
that
is,
you
find
that
looking
back
at
what
this
court
did
in
the
lemaistre
v.
leffers
case,
looking
at...
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
looking
at
the
juxtaposition
of
section
560
and
525,
looking
at
the
fact
that
this
court
indicated
back
in
1948,
560
is
what
provides
the
better
protection
for
people,
not
525,
and
from
that,
inferring...
because
560
has
a
hardship
requirement
in
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
you
wouldn't
have
decided
the
case
in
lemaistre
in
1943,
your
honor,
unfortunately,
but
the
reason
i
answered
your
question
that
way
was
because
what
i
understood
you
to
ask
me,
that
was
the
exigent
circumstance
issue,
and
the
exigent
circumstances
in
that
context
was
war.
i
did
not
mean
to
deal
with
the
hardship.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
i
would
today
make
the
same
argument
in
terms
of
a
hardship
requirement
having
to
be
there.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
i
would
make
the
argument,
but
i
wouldn't
have
the
support
that
subsequently--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--in
terms
of
hardship,
that
is
my
position,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
want
to
leave
justice
stevens'
point,
if
i
may.
the
510,
in
the
last
part
of
it...
again,
this
is
the
general
provisions...
talks
about
that
these
provisions
are
made
for
the
temporary
suspension
of
legal
proceedings
in
transactions
which
may
prejudice
the
civil
rights
of
persons
in
such
services...
prejudice
the
civil
rights
of
such
person
in
the
services.
not
alone
does
510
talk
about
exigent
circumstances,
but
it
has
an
overview
of
the
concept
of
prejudice--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--right,
and--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--if...
in
order
to
ask
the
question,
i
respectfully
suggest...
in
order
to
say,
might
it
prejudice,
might
it
not
prejudice
it,
in
the
litigation
setting,
you
have
to
then
say,
how
are
we
going
to
determine
this,
and
somebody's
going
to
have
to
question--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--right.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
that's...
that's--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--okay.
that's
literally
true,
but
i
think
the
next
logical
step
is,
if
one
concedes
that
the
issue
of
the
possible
existence,
the
may
be
of
prejudice
exists.
either
the
question's
got
to
be
asked
affirmatively
by
the
people
seeking
to
get
this
quiet
title
action,
or
it
has
to
be
asked
by
the
other
side,
but
somebody's
got
to
ask
the
question.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
okay.
in
making
the
transition,
then,
to
the
redemption
issue,
whether
or
not
one
gets
the
benefit
of
redemption
or
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
redemption,
you
have
to
make
a
finding
of,
is
this
going
to
provide
a
hardship,
or
in
the
alternative,
is
it
sufficient
that
someone
has
the
status
of
a
military
person?
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
section
510
and
section
560
both...
both
have
a
implicit
concept
of
hardship
or
prejudice.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
not
necessarily.
in
5--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--you
have
it
in
560
because
560
subsection
(2)
specifically
provides
for
a
hearing
for
a
determination
of
a
question.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
that's
true.
moving
on
from
where
i
just
was
in
terms
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
king
v.
st.
vincent's
hospital,
decided
by
this
court
a
year
ago,
has
some
pertinent
language
in
it,
but
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
issues
in
the
veterans'
reemployment
rights
act
and
the
issues
before
this
court
in
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
are
disparate,
different
matters.
it
is
true
that
they
relate
to
servicemen,
and
it
is
true
that
they
relate
to
interpretation.
after
you
get
beyond
that,
i
think
that
the
petitioner's
comfort
in
citing
this
case
is
just
misplaced.
this
act
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
is
an
act
that
is
germane
to
itself
in
terms
of
its
history,
its
enactment,
then
its
reenactment.
it
has...
the
veteran's
reemployment
rights
act
has
nothing
to
do,
directly
or
indirectly,
with
the
soldiers'
&
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
the
references,
however,
in
that
act
to
interpreting
the
statute
in
the
context
of
the
full
statute
i
think
are
very
germane,
and
they
apply
here
very
strongly
because
we're
not
talking
about
one
section
in
isolation,
again
with
judicial
blinders.
we're
talking
about
one
section
in
the
context
of
an
entire
statute,
and
how
it
affects
and
interacts
with
the
entire
statute.
and
again,
i
reference
this
court's
decision
in
lemaistre
because
this
court...
although
it
didn't
anticipate
where
we
are
today,
this
court
back
in
1948
did
anticipate
the
tension
and
dynamic
and
interrelationship
of
those
two
sections
and
found
them
to
be
supportive
of
one
another,
not
inconsistent
or
mutually
exclusive.
i
would
also
suggest,
and
i
think
i
may
have
mentioned
it
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
mentioned
it,
the
courts
that
deal
with
the
issue
of
real
estate
taking,
of
seizing
for
taxes,
they...
and
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
cases
from
florida,
cases
from
new
mexico...
they
support
the
proposition
that
the
legitimacy
of
deeding
property,
the
whole
concept
of
the
title,
the
chain
of
title
in
property,
demands
for
that
process
that
there
be
some
showing
of
hardship
or
prejudice.
they
talk
about
career
servicemen
and
noncareer
servicemen,
and
i
think
that
that's
another
way
of
saying
prejudice,
or
hardship.
that's
really
what
they're
talking
about,
because
implicitly
if
one
is
a
career
person,
one
has
a
regular
income,
one
is
under
reasonably
situations,
unless
one
can
demonstrate
that
there's
a
hardship
and
i
think
that's
where
the
language
career
comes
into
play,
and
it
really
has
its
foundation
in
the
concept
of
hardship.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
because
if
you
were
living
in
danforth
or
for
that
matter
by
pease
air
force
base
or
loring
air
force
base
in
maine,
where
a
lot
of
people...
military
people
have
property,
and
for
whatever
reason
they
elect
not
to
continue
to
pay
taxes
on
their
property,
and
the
municipalities,
which
derive
their
revenue
and
support
from
that
property,
seize
that
property
and
sell
it,
and
you
are
on
their
mailing
list,
and
you
happen
to
get
a
solicitation,
come
by
some
great
property
in
maine,
150
acres,
or
30,
or
40,
or
50
acres,
and
you
check
the
title,
all
you're
going
to
know
is
that
there
was
a
tax
sale,
and
you
hire
a
very
competent
lawyer,
and
he
or
she
checks
that
tax
sale
and
is
satisfied
that
the
requirements
have
been
complied
with
in
terms
of
effecting
a
tax
sale,
what
you
have
done
to
the
conveyancing
is,
you
have
raised
a
significant
cloud
because
of
this
status.
what
you
have
done
to
the
town
of
danforth
or
the
town
of
limestone
or
caribou,
maine,
is
you
have
deflated
the
values
of
that
property,
because
now,
based
upon...
potentially,
this
court's
interpretation...
there
is
a
great
risk
here.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
that's
true,
and
i
don't
mean
to
retreat
from
your
implicit
question
of,
what
is
hardship?
it
is
not
a
clearly
defined
term,
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
then
a
lot
of
what
you
deal
with
and
what
i
deal
with
in
lesser
terms...
due
process--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--well--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--that's
true,
but
not
simply
because
they
come
in
and
they
have
a
uniform
on.
if
there
is
a
hardship--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--then
you
have
a
risk.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
and
i
guess--
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
--that's
true,
and
i
don't
mean
to
put
rosy
glasses
on
this.
a
tax
sale,
by
definition,
is
a
risky
business.
i'm
just
saying
that
we
are
eliminating
a
risk.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
i
cannot
tell
you,
your
honor,
right
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i
just
cannot
tell
you,
and
it...
being
our
state
and
with
our
economy,
it
changes.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
cuddy
yes,
and
i
would...
and
i
appreciate
your
mentioning
that,
because
you
bring
one
more
point
that
i
want
to
make
sure
i
state
to
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
this
is
a
quiet
title
action,
but
one
aspect
of
this
case
is
also
a
trespass
action.
now,
that
is
not
before
you,
but
i
simply
want
to
highlight
that,
because
depending
on
what
you
do...
and
i'm
hopeful
that
you
simply
affirm
what
happened
below,
but
should
you
not,
and
should
you
decide
to
go
in
a
different
direction,
there
is
another
loose
end
to
this
case
that
the
issue
that
we're
dealing
with
today
will
not
finally
dispose
of.
i
have
concluded
those
points
that
i

believe
the

your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
