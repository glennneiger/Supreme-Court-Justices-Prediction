mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
bona
fide
purchaser.
the
statute
contains
one
provision
which
explicitly
addresses
when
a
bona
fide
purchaser
of
land
can
obtain
relief
when
a
transaction
is
affected
by
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
that
is
provided
in
section
520
of
the
appendix,
which
deals
with
default
judgments.
if
a
default
judgment
is
entered
against
a
service
member,
and
the
service
member
can
show
within
a
specified
period
subsequent
to
his
military
service
that
he
was
prejudiced
in
his
ability
to
defend
the
suit
because
of
his
military
service,
he
can
have
that
judgment
vacated.
the
provision
explicitly
provides
that
any
property
obtained
by
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value
pursuant
to
that
judgment
will
be
protected
against
the
vacation
of
that
default
judgment
by
the
service
member.
now,
this
illustrates
one
important
point...
two
important
points.
first,
under
section
525,
there
is
no
similar
protection,
so
the
right
to
redeem
is
tolled
irrespective
of
any
state
law
that
would
protect
a
bona
fide
purchaser.
second,
it
shows
that
the
statute
is
a
very
carefully
drafted
provision
for
the
protection
of
service
members.
mr.
justice
brandeis
stated,
writing
for
the
court
in--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it
is
conceivable,
justice
scalia,
that
that
is
the
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
more
likely,
given
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
extent
to
which
congress
was
careful
in
specifying
which
remedies
would
and
would
not
be
available
and
the
desire
of
congress
to
protect
the
service
member
from
various
state
law
judgments
and
liabilities
during
the
period
of
service,
that
it's
much
more
likely
that
the
force
of
section
525,
which
is
broad
and
absolute
in
its
terms,
must
be
taken
as
preemptive
of
any
state
law
right
to
vest
the
title
in
a
bona
fide
purchaser.
otherwise,
a
state
could
simply,
by
a
variety
of
state
rules,
eliminate
a
protection
that
is
broad,
that
is
mandatory,
and
that
is
unqualified
in
its
application.
along
the
lines
of
the
implications
of
the
statute,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
ebert
v.
poston,
this
statute
was
so
carefully
drafted
that
very
little
is
left
to
conjecture,
and
given
the
act's
disparate
inclusion
and
omission
of
a
prejudice
requirement
in
its
various
sections,
the
failure
to
include
a
prejudice
requirement
in
section
525
must
be
understood
as
a
deliberate
policy
choice.
congress
carefully
considered
when
prejudice
should,
and
more
importantly
should
not,
be
a
factor
in
awarding
relief
under
the
act,
and
it
obviously
decided
that
in
section
525
it
should
not
be
awarded...
it
should
not
be
a
factor
in
the
relief
granted.
now,
to
highlight
a
point
that
mr.
klonoff
made,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
section
560
of
the
appendix.
section
560
specifically
addresses--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--no,
i
apologize,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it's
the
appendix
to
title
50,
where
the
act
is
codified.
section
560
of
the
appendix
to
title--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it
is
cited.
it's
cited
and
discussed
in
the
text,
your
honor.
the
appendix
to
title
50
provides
relief
from
tax
sales
of
certain
kinds
of
property.
now,
the
property
at
issue
here
is
not
among
the
classes
of
property
that's
covered
by
that
provision.
it
relates
to...
in
terms
of
real
property,
it
relates
to
residential,
business,
professional,
and
agricultural
property
owned
by
the
service
member
at
the
commencement
of
service
and
still
owned
at
the
time
of
the
tax
sale.
if
a
tax
sale
is
to
occur
under
that--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--owned
and
occupied
by
the
service
member
or
his
dependents
or
employees.
if...
before
a
tax
sale
can
occur,
a
court
order
must
be
obtained
for
that
type
of
property,
and
the
service
member
or
his
dependents
may
get
a
stay
of
the
tax
sale
during
the
period
of
military
service
unless
the
service
member's
ability
to
pay
or
his
dependents'
ability
to
pay
the
taxes
is
not
materially
affected
by
the
military
service.
so
there
is
an
explicit
prejudice
requirement
contained
in
that
provision
which
supplies
relief
from
the
tax
sale
itself.
in
the
very
next
provision
of
section
560,
the
act
provides
that
the
period
of
redemption,
the
right
of
redemption
or
the
right
to
bring
an
action
for
redemption,
shall
extend
throughout
the
period
of
the
act
and
for
6
months
thereafter.
it
has
no
mention
of
material
effect
of
military
service.
it
has
no
prejudice
requirement
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
that
provision,
which
dates
back
in
its
original
form
to
the
1918
legislation,
shows
that
congress
intentionally
distinguished
between
the
kinds
of
relief
it
would
be
providing
for
tax
forfeitures,
and
when
it
got
to
the
point
of
redemption,
it
decided
to
provide
an
absolute
protection
that
extended
without
regard
to
prejudice
throughout
the
period
of
military
service.
now,
respondents
don't
claim
that
the
similarly
worded
language
of
section
525
is
ambiguous.
what
they
claim
is
that
the
court
should
not
apply
the
statute
as
written
because
of
the
practical
consequences
of
allowing
a
career
service
member
to
redeem
his
property
throughout
the
period
of
military
service
without
a
showing
of
prejudice.
now,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
practical
consequences
argument
is
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
in
king
v.
st.
vincent's
hospital,
the
statute
as
written
is
far
from
absurd.
respondents
don't
claim
that
it's
absurd
to
redeem
the
tolling
provision...
to
toll
the
redemption
provision
for
service
members
in
general.
what
they
claim
is
that
it
is
absurd
to
do
so
without
a
particularized
inquiry
in
each
case
into
whether
there
has
been
prejudice.
now,
that
is
simply
not
absurd.
congress,
because
the
period
of
redemption
is
the
last
safety
valve
before
property
is
lost
irrevocably,
it
is
perfectly
rational
for
congress
to
have
decided
that
it
would
provide
service
members
with
the
assurance
that
their
property
would
not
be
lost
forever
during
their
period
of
military
service.
because
of
its
self-executing
nature,
section
525
provides
service
members
with
the
peace
of
mind
that
they
will
not
have
to
rely
on
a
court's
determination
in
hindsight
that
this
or
that
tour
of
duty
was
or
was
not
prejudicial
to
their
ability
to
redeem
their
property,
and
so
what
it
does
is,
in
effect,
it
gives
the
service
members
an
effective
right
to
wait
their
period
of
military
service
before
exercising
their
right
of
redemption,
otherwise
we
doubt
that
many
service
members
would
take
the
risk
that
a
court
would,
in
hindsight,
find
that
they
had
not
been
prejudiced
by
their
tour
of
military
duty.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
right.
it
was
vacant
land
that
he
was
holding
to
have
as
a
vacation
spot.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
uncertainties
that
respondents
note,
and
the
cloud
on
tax
title
that
they
assert
as
the
absurdity
in
this
case,
would
exist
even
if
there
were
a
prejudice
requirement
under
the
statute.
if
a
service
member
were
entitled
to
toll
his
redemption
period
upon
a
showing
of
prejudice,
it
would
be
equally
difficult,
indeed,
impossible
to
tell
from
the
chain
of
title
whether
there
was
a
service
member
in
the
chain
of
title,
and
whether
the
service
member's
particular
tour
of
duty
was
prejudicial
to
his
ability
to
redeem.
because
the
statute
is
clear,
because
the
structure
confirms
the
statute,
and
because
of
the
canon
requiring
liberal
construction
of
a
statute
for
the
benefit
of
service
members,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
