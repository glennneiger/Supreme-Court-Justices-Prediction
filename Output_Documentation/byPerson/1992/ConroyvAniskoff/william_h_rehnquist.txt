chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1353,
thomas
f.
conroy
v.
walter
aniskoff.
the
spectators
are
admonished
to
remain
silent
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
mr.
klonoff,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
article
134
provide
that's
relevant
to
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
may
well
deal
with
individual
cases,
mr.
klonoff,
but
if
we're
now
turning
to
the
bad
consequences
of
adopting
the
position
you
say
the
statute
requires,
i
think
perhaps
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
state
or
the
town,
it's
simply
an
inability
to
sell
at
a
tax
sale.
the
titles
simply
are
too
uncertain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
a
quit
claim
deed
is
a
good
deal
different
than...
you
can't
get
title
insurance
on
the
basis
of
a
quit
claim
deed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klonoff.
mr.
manning,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
of
the
appendix,
are
you
referring
to
the
appendix
to
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
cited
anywhere
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
mr.
cuddy,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
set
forth
section
560
in
your
brief,
mr.
cuddy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
suggest
to
each
of
you
that
if
you
plan
to
do
that
in
the
future
you
should
not...
you
should
very
definitely
set
forth
the
statute
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
a
recital
at
the
beginning,
isn't
it,
about
exigent
circumstances?
it
doesn't
say,
the
statute
shall
be
enforced
only
so
long
as
the
exigent
circumstances
exist.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead
and
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cuddy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klonoff,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1353,
conroy
against
aniskoff
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
