mr.
klonoff,
the
statute
really
doesn't
say
that
any
property
sold
in
violation
of
the
federal
prohibition
is
not
effectively
sold,
does
it?
is
that
a
matter
of
state
law?
i
mean,
could
maine
law
say
that
if
this
statute
is
violated
and
we
goof
and
make
the
sale
within
the
18-month
period,
a
good
faith
purchaser
nonetheless
has
title,
and
maybe
you
have
a
cause
of
action
against
maine
but
not
against
the
bfp?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
not
overriding
the
statute.
the
statute
doesn't
really
say
that
the
transfer
shall
be
ineffective,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say
so,
but
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
why
does
it
have
that
effect?
it
doesn't
say
that
it
has
that
effect.
it
just
says,
you
know,
that
you
have
to
give
him
more
time.
okay,
i
have,
and
you
got
me,
i
broke
the
law...
so
sue
me.
i
mean,
maybe
he
has
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state
of
maine,
if
that's
what
maine
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
government
might
have
wanted
to
protect
by
federal
law
a
bfp
in
the
one
situation,
and
decided
not
to
protect
him
by
federal
law
in
the
other,
but
left
it
open
to
the
state
to
protect
him.
isn't
that
a
conceivable
explanation?
justice
antonin
scalia
owned
and
occupied,
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
it's
present
in
560
demonstrates
that
it's
presence
in
510
is
irrelevant,
because
if
it's
presence
in
510
justifies
reading
it
into
525,
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
have
it
in
560.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
is,
we
don't
need
an
explicit
hardship
requirement
in
525
because
it's
in
510,
which
is
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
act,
and
that
hardship
requirement
spills
over
into
all
of
the
act,
but
if
that
were
true,
there
wouldn't
be
any
hardship
requirement
in
560.
you
wouldn't
need
it,
because
it
would
be
supplied
by
510.
but
we
have
it
in
560.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
it
because
you
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cuddy,
can
i
ask
you
to
address
the
point
the
government
makes
about
where
the
burden
of
this
uncertainty
should
lie,
and
whether
it's
so
absurd
to
place
the
burden
where
they
say
it's
been
placed.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
absurd
to
say,
as
they
claim
the
statute
provides,
in
560,
the...
which
stays
the
whole
sale.
you
want
to
come
in
and
stay
the
whole
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
statute
says,
if
you
want
to
stay
the
whole
sale,
you
have
to
prove
the
hardship,
but
if
the
sale
goes
forward
and
all
you
want
to
do
is
have
a
later
right
to
redeem,
you
don't
have
to
prove
the
hardship,
because,
says
the
government...
what
does
hardship
mean?
i
mean,
this
fellow's
in
military
service,
he's
fighting
a
war
somewhere,
or
giving
out
food
somewhere,
or
doing
something,
and
can't
get
home,
and
his
advisor
tells
him,
don't
worry,
if
you
can
prove
hardship,
you
can
always
redeem
that
property,
and
he
asks
him,
well,
what
does
proving
hardship
consist
of?
he
says,
oh,
it's
a
very
nice
question.
proving
hardship.
maybe
you
don't
have
enough
money
because
you've
been
shipped
overseas
and
have...
you
know,
have
to
make
all...
i
wouldn't
want
to
have
to
gamble
on
the
fact
that
i
could
prove
hardship.
so
why
isn't
it
perfectly
sensible
to
say,
you
know,
at
least
for
purposes
of
the
redemption
provision,
we're
going
to
give
the
serviceman
a
free
ride...
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
the
hardship?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there...
but
there's
a
risk
anyway.
i
mean,
you'd
still
buy
the
property...
well,
you're
advising
the
person
who
wants
to
buy
the
property
from
the
tax
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
saying
is,
you
can
give
him
the
great
comfort
of
saying,
don't
worry...
don't
worry,
no
soldier
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
back
and
snatch
this
out
from
under
your
nose
unless
he
can
prove
hardship,
right?
even
under
your
theory,
you
don't
have
sure
ownership.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
its
certainty
or
uncertainty
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
talking
about
the
fact
that
even
under
your
theory
there
is
no
sure
conveyancing
in
a
tax
sale.
you
can
never
be
sure
that
there
isn't
a
substantial
likelihood
that
some
armed
forces
member
can
redeem.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lesser
risk,
but
it's
still
a
pretty
substantial
one,
it
seems.
