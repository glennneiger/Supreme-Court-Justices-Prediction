mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
525
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
excludes
a
service
member's
period
of
military
service
from
any
period
provided
by
law
for
the
redemption
of
real
property
forfeited
for
nonpayment
of
real
estate
taxes.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
service
member
must
show
hardship
in
order
to
invoke
section
525.
we
submit
that
the
courts
below,
in
imposing
such
a
requirement,
violated
this
court's
case
law
and
statutory
interpretation
for
three
reasons.
first,
section
525
by
its
plain
language
imposes
no
hardship
requirement.
second,
several
other
sections
of
the
statute
do
impose
a
hardship
requirement,
while
other
sections,
like
section
525,
do
not.
this
confirms
that
congress
acted
deliberately
when
it
did
not
impose
a
hardship
requirement
under
section
525.
third,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
statutes
providing
benefits
to
service
members
should
be
liberally
construed.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
enforce
the
statute
as
written
and
decline
respondent's
invitation
to
rewrite
the
statute
on
policy
grounds.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple,
and
i
will
spend
just
a
moment
on
them.
at
the
time
of
trial,
colonel
conroy
had
been
on
continuous
active
duty
in
the
u.s.
army
since
1966.
he
purchased
the
property
at
issue
in
may
1973,
and
paid
all
real
estate
taxes
between
1973
and
1983.
he
did
not
pay
his
taxes
in
'84
through
'86,
having
received
no
tax
notices
from
the
town.
the
town
of
danforth
seized
his
land
under
maine
law
and
sold
it
in
two
parcels
to
respondents
aniskoff
and
h.
c.
haynes
in
december
1986.
upon
learning
of
the
sale,
colonel
conroy
acted
promptly
in
asserting
his
rights.
when
aniskoff
and
haynes
refused
to
give
up
the
land,
colonel
conroy
brought
quiet
title
actions
based
on
section
525.
the
trial
court
held
that
despite
section
525's
clear
language,
a
service
member
had
to
show
hardship
from
military
service,
which
colonel
conroy
did
not
do.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
affirmed
the
superior
court
by
an
equally
divided
vote
and
did
not
express
any
reasoning.
we
submit
that
this
case
should
be
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
king
v.
st.
vincent's
hospital.
at
issue
in
king
was
a
national
guard
member
who
sought
a
3-year
leave
of
absence
from
his
hospital
employer
to
join
the
active
guard
reserve
program
as
a
command
sergeant
major.
he
claimed
that
under
the
plain
language
of
the
veteran
reemployment
rights
act
he
was
allowed
to
return
to
his
job
with
the
same
seniority,
pay,
and
vacation
as
if
he
had
not
left.
the
hospital
denied
the
leave
request
on
the
ground
that
the
period
requested
was
unreasonable.
although
the
statutory
language
contained
no
limits
for
leave
requests,
the
lower
courts...
both
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
district
court...
imposed
a
reasonableness
requirement
because
of
their
concern
about
the
burdens
placed
on
employers
of
allowing
employees
to
return
after
long
leaves
of
absences.
this
court
unanimously
reversed...
justice
thomas
did
not
participate...
because,
really
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
am
urging
here:
1)
the
language
of
the
section
at
issue
was
clear,
2)
other
parts
of
the
statute,
by
contrast,
explicitly
imposed
time
limits,
and
3)
the
statute
provided
benefits
to
members
of
the
armed
services.
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
statute
was
harsh,
but
refused
to
rewrite
the
law
and
noted
that
that
was
congress'
job.
here,
we
have
an
identical
situation.
the
language
of
section
525
is
absolutely
clear,
and
there
has
been
no
claim
as
far
as
i
know
on
any
case
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
section
525.
under
this
court's
case
law,
we
submit
that
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
however,
it
is
even
clearer
than
just
the
language
of
section
525
alone,
since
a
review
of
the
statute
indicates
that
several
other
sections,
unlike
section
525,
impose
a
hardship
requirement
explicitly,
and
we
cited
numerous
examples
on
page
12,
footnotes
11
and
12,
of
our
opening
brief.
we
have
also
cited
a
number
of
examples
of
other
parts
of
the
statute
that,
like
section
525,
contain
no
prejudice
requirement,
so
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
statute
was
very
carefully
drafted
and
that
when
congress
wanted
to
impose
a
hardship
requirement,
it
did
so
explicitly,
and
we
point
for
example,
section
560,
which
is
of
particular
interest,
since
right
within
the
same
section
you've
got
juxtaposition
of
a
hardship
and
no-hardship
standard.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i
don't
think
that
the
state
could
do
that,
they
could
override
the
statute.
there
are
a
variety
of
causes
of
action--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
has
that
effect.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
but
the
whole
concept
of
a
redemption
is
the
right
to
actually...
if
title
is
passed,
the
right
to
take
back
title.
in
maine,
the
way
the
law
is
constructed
is
title
doesn't
even
pass
until
the
end
of
the
redemption
period.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
not
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
we
read
the
statute
as
allowing
the
serviceman,
if
title
is
transferred
and
there's
a
period
of
redemption,
to
take
the
title
back.
i
suppose
what
could
be
done,
since
it
talks
about
any
period
of
redemption
provided
by
law,
is,
i
suppose,
to
not
have
any
redemption
period
in
this
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
that's
right,
but
in
some
states
the
title
actually
will
pass,
subject
to
the
redemption.
if
there's
a
redemption
statute,
the
way
it
works
is
that
the
title
would
be
returned.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
no,
that's
right.
in
maine
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
so
as
we
indicated,
these
sections
and
the
juxtaposition
in
560
makes
clear
that
congress
knew
how
to
pose
a
hardship
requirement
when
it
wanted
to
do
so.
and
finally,
as
i
indicated,
this
court
has
made
clear
in
a
number
of
cases
that
statutes
of
this
sort
must
be
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
the
serviceman.
the
court
below...
the
trial
court...
did
not
make
a
textual
argument,
but
instead
expressed
concerns
about
the
possible
impact
of
purchasers
of
property
if
service
members
are
allowed
to
come
in
years
later
to
redeem
their
property,
but
as
in
king,
we
submit
that
any
such
concerns
are
for
congress
and
not
for
the
court.
we
think
that
in
this
case
the
lower
court
misunderstood
its
role,
believing
that
if
a
statute
was
harsh,
a
court
could
ignore
the
plain
language,
but
under
this
court's
case
law
a
court
is
almost
never
permitted
to
ignore
the
plain
language
on
policy
grounds,
and
certainly
not
for
the
reasons
offered
below.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
statute
literally
read
must
be
patently
absurd,
with
consequences
so
bizarre
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
them,
and
it's
been
phrased
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
in
the
crooks
case
from
1930,
which
has
been
cited
in
griffin
and
tva
v.
hill,
it
was
made
clear
that
it's
not
enough
that
it's
merely
absurd,
and
that
oftentimes
laws
have
effects
that
weren't
contemplated,
but
it's
for
congress
to
decide
the
issue.
and
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases...
griffin,
has
said
that
harsh
consequences
are
not
enough,
a
situation
where
a
seaman
was
entitled
to
receive
over
300,000
dollars
from
an
employer
because
of
a
412
dollar
withholding
of
wages.
the
tva
v.
hill,
which
involved
a
multimillion
dollar
dam
project
which
was
stopped
near
completion,
the
court
said
that
the
result
was
curious,
but
not
enough
to
override...
and
numerous
other
cases
that
this
court...
and
this
court
has
made
clear
in
estate
of
cowart
that
even
if
a
statute
could
be
characterized
as
stark
or
troubling,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
enforce
congress'
language
even
if
the
court
questions
its
wisdom.
now,
looking
at
section
525
and
actually
juxtaposing
525
with
the
situation
in
king,
we
would
submit
that
there's
not
even
an
absurdity,
let
alone
a
situation
that's
so
patently
absurd
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
it.
in
king,
for
example,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
3-year
period
was
not
the
end
of
the
possibility
in
that
situation.
there
was
a
question
asked
at
page
6
of
the
oral
argument
in
that
case,
in
the
transcript,
about
whether
or
not
the
period
could
be
renewed
four
times
for,
say,
12
years,
and
the
answer
that
the
assistant
to
the
solicitor
general
gave
was
that
theoretically
that's
possible.
she
didn't
know
of
a
case,
but
theoretically
it
was
possible,
and
the
situation,
then,
you
have
in
king,
was
somebody
coming
back
12
years
and
basically...
and
in
king,
for
example,
the
individuals
reflected
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
was
the
manager
of
security
could
come
in
12
years
later
and
just
walk
in
and
demand
his
job
back
after
somebody
had
been
hired
and
so
forth.
and
so
really,
that
is
or
could
be
a
harsh
and
troubling
situation,
but
it
was
not
enough,
and
in
fact
the
court...
although
the
eleventh
circuit
resolved
the
case
as
a
matter
of
absurd
consequences,
this
court
in
king
didn't
even
address
the
absurd
consequences
at
all,
and
just
said
that
the
matter
was
for
congress
to
consider.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
he's
actually
now
retired,
although
that's
not
reflected--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
correct.
i
think
pursuant
to
the
stipulation
that
we
set
out
in
our
brief
and
that's
set
out
in
the
opinion,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
issue
in
terms
of
either
side
complying
with
state
law,
but
formally
in
this
situation
you
would
make
a
tender.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
he
would
have
that
right,
and
i
think
then
the
property
owner
would
have
civil
causes
of
action
available,
and
that
would
be
true,
by
the
way,
to
the
taxing
authority.
they
could
sue
for
damages,
they
could
levy
against--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--exactly,
levy
taxes.
let
me
just
say,
though,
you're
positing,
i
think,
a
situation
in
which
somebody
would
really
have
an
incentive
to
want
to
stretch
the
period
of
redemption
out,
and
that's
what
the
lower
court
was
talking
about,
posing
the
situation
of
somebody
waiting
30
years
and
simply
not--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
that's
correct,
but
let
me
provide,
if
i
could,
some
perspective
on
that,
because
really
what
we're
talking
about
and
the
assumption,
i
think,
of
the
so-called
absurd
consequences
is
the
idea
of
a
service
member
who
has
a
valid
and
just
debt
just
really
out
of
reasons
for
dishonesty
not
paying
off
the
debt
and
trying
to
abuse,
if
you
will,
the
rights
that
are
provided.
we
don't
think
as
a
practical
matter
this
is
going
to
arise.
there
are
a
whole
array
of
remedies
available
that
the
military
has.
for
example,
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
army
has
regulations--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
what
it
provides
is
that
an
individual
can
be
court-martialled
for
conduct
of
a
nature
that
would
bring
discredit
on
the
armed
forces,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
such
as
united
states
v.
sivinovich,
the
u.s.
army
court
of
military
review
of
1988,
applying
that
precisely
to
the
bad
debt
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
what
the
court
has
held,
if
there
is
a
just
debt.
let
me
go
further,
though,
than
just
the
article
134.
the
u.s.
army
has
specific
regulations
at
part
513
of
32
c.f.r.,
which
says
that
if
a
soldier
is
not
trying
to
resolve
unpaid
debts
promptly,
or
complaints
of
the
sort
are
received,
punitive
measures
can
be
provided
such
as
a
denial
of
reenlistment,
administrative
separation
from
the
service
or
other
sorts
of
punishments.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
we
would
respectfully
disagree
that
that's
the
outcome.
even
if
there
were
a
prejudice
requirement,
you'd
still
have
an
issue
about
military
service.
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
there
might
later
be
a
cloud
on
title,
such
as
a
fraudulent
deed,
ineffective
notice,
or
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
a
tax
sale.
many
states
have
requirements
that...
there's
a
redemption
period
for
a
period
of
mental
incompetence,
and
what
is
done
in
these
tax
sales,
traditionally
what
was
done
in
this
case,
is
the
execution
of
a
quit
claim
deed,
which
means,
in
effect,
that
the
purchase
gets
whatever,
any
title
there
is,
and
so
the
state
could
go
forward,
if
it
can't
ascertain
the
situation,
and
actually
sell
the
property,
and
the
risk--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
a
person
purchasing
the
property
takes
all
kinds
of
risks,
and
this
is
something,
along
with
many
other
things,
that
can
be
looked
into.
i
would
note
that,
for
example,
the
statute,
section
581
has
a
certification
procedure,
and
in
maine,
for
example,
it's
very
common
for
lawyers
to
write
to
the
armed
forces
and
actually
get
a
determination
whether
someone
is
in
military
service.
in
many
of
these
situations,
the
people
in
question
are
there
locally
and
so
the
issue
can
be
resolved.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes,
that
is
right.
that
is
a
remedy
that's
available.
it's
by
statute,
and
it's
absolutely
clear
that
they
can
pursue
a
civil
remedy.
now,
of
course,
you're
going
to
have
the
array
of
other
soldiers'
and
sailors'
act
provisions
kicking
in,
such
as
the
default
provisions
and
so
on,
but
there
are
these
alternative
remedies.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
unless
this
court
has
any
questions,
i
would
simply
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
should
be
reversed.
