to
whom
does
the
united
states
criminal
law
apply
in
antarctica?
does...
it
has
to
be
an
american
citizen,
or--
justice
anthony

kennedy
section
924(g)
prohibits
the
transfer
of
a
firearm
that's
going
to
be
used
in
drug
transfer...
in
drug
trafficking.
i
take
it
that
under
your
view
if
someone
transfers
a
firearm
to
a
person,
knowing
that
the
transferee
is
going
to
use
it
to
trade
drugs...
to
trade
for
drugs,
there's
no
liability
under
(g).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
word...
definition
of
the
word
use
is
such
that
it
has
to
be
somehow
used
in
order
to
protect
the
person
and
not
for
a
trade.
so,
i
take
it
under
your
interpretation,
the
word
use
has
to
be
given
the
same
definition
so
that
if
people
trade
firearms,
knowing
that
the
firearms
will
be
used
by
the
transferees
to
be
traded
for
drugs,
there's
no
violation
of
under
(g).
it
has
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
whoever
knowingly
transfers
a
firearm,
knowing
that
such
firearm
will
be
used
to
commit
a
crime
of
drug
trafficking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
let's
assume
that
the
transfer
element
of
my
hypothetical
is
satisfied.
under
your
definition,
there
is
no
use
of
the
firearm
even
though
he
is...
the
transferor
knows
that
it's
going
to
be
used
to
trade
for
drugs.
it's
not
being
used
under
your
theory.
