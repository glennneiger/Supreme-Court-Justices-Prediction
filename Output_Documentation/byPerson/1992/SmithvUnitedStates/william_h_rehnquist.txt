we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1538,
sandra
jean
smith
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
bederman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bederman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
certainly.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wright,
a
moment
ago
you
referred
to
what
you
say
is
petitioner's
response
to
your
1346(b)
point.
what
precisely
is
your
1346(b)
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
deduction
do
you
draw
from
that
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wright,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
bederman,
you
have
20
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bederman,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
government's
argument
about
1346(b),
that
the
united
states
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
government's
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
is
no
tort
law
governing
in...
in
antarctica,
and
therefore
without
regard
to
the
foreign
nation
exception,
you
are
not
brought
within
1346.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statute
says
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred,
which...
and
here
the
act
or
omission
occurred
in
antarctica,
it's
conceded,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
there...
if
there
is
no
law
there,
i...
how
do
you
get
to
choice
of
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
you
would
prefer
to
read
out
the
last
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
nonsubstantive
points?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bederman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-8674,
john
angus
smith
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
kollin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
to
say
use
means
actual
use
doesn't
help
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
saying
that...
you're
really
putting
quite
a
narrow
construction
on
the
phrase.
one
doesn't
ordinarily
think
of
the
kind
of
drug
transactions
that
the
statute
is...
don't
you
think
of
them
as
being
more
consensual
than
involving
somebody
sticking
somebody
up
and
getting
drugs
from
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
say
the
carpenter
used
the
hammer
to
obtain
what
he
traded
it
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
mr.
kollin.
the
case
is
submitted.
