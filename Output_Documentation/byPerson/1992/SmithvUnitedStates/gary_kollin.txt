mr.
gary
kollin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
john
angus
smith
was
convicted
of
a
violation
of
title
18,
united
states
code,
924(c),
when
he
possessed
a
firearm
and
offered
it
as
an
item
in
trade
for
barter
for
a
small
quantity
of
drugs.
as
a
result
of
his
conviction,
he
received
30
years
minimum
sentence,
consecutive
to
the
terms
he
received
on
his
other
counts.
the
issue
today
is
whether
the
offering
of
a
firearm
solely
as
an
item
of
barter
violates
18
united
states
code
924(c)
for
the
use
of
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
federal
drug
trafficking
crime.
at
the
outset,
it
is
important
to
realize
that
this
statute
provides
two
different
methods
by
which
it
could
be
violated:
first,
by
the
use
of
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
the
federal
drug
trafficking
crime;
and
the
second
way
is
by
carrying
the
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
the
federal
drug
trafficking
crime.
john
angus
smith
was
only
charged
with
the
use
prong
of
the
statute.
we
submit
that--
mr.
gary
kollin
--that
is
correct,
justice.
however,
the
government
elected,
for
whatever
reasons
they
chose,
to
only
charge
him
with
the
use
prong.
in
fact,
this
was
the
third
superseding
indictment
in
regard
to
this
matter,
and
in
each
one
he
was
only
charged
with
the
use
prong.
so,
they
had
three
times
to
change
that
election.
mr.
gary
kollin
that
is
probably
correct,
justice.
mr.
gary
kollin
that
is
probably
true,
but
the
government
did
choose
to
and
elected
to
charge
him
with
use,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we're
here
today
and
what
he
is
charged
with.
mr.
gary
kollin
well--
mr.
gary
kollin
--justice
scalia--
mr.
gary
kollin
--i'm
prepared
to
argue
that,
and--
mr.
gary
kollin
--because
what
i
want
to
say
here
is
that
if
we
accept
the
government's
suggestion
of
the
definition
of
use,
this
all-encompassing
definition,
or
the
lower
courts',
then
the
word
use
would
always
swallow
up
and
encompass
the
word
carry.
there
could
never
be
a
situation
where
someone
could
use
a
firearm
under
their
definition
or
under
the
definition
of
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts
where
one
would
not
be
also
carrying.
i
mean,
if
you
would
carry
it,
you
always
would
use
it.
and
the
principles...
i
cannot
think
of
a
situation
under
their
definition
where
it
could
not
occur.
mr.
gary
kollin
under
their
definition,
it's
to
possess
with
the
intent
to
facilitate
the
crime,
to
possess
and
the
presumption
of
intention.
so,
under
their
definition,
any
time
that
one
is
carrying
the
firearm,
one
is
always
using
it
in
regard
to
the
statute.
and
the
basic
axiomatic
rules
of
construction
of
this
court
is
that
we
should
never
render
a
term
in
a
statute
to
be
superfluous
and
that
each
word
should
be
given
effect.
and
if
we
don't
narrow
the
definition
of
the
word
use
to
the
definition
that
we
have
suggested
here,
that
is,
to
define
that
use
means
the
actual
use
in
the
active
connotation...
according
to
the
active
connotation
of
the
word
use,
then
the
word
carry
would
have
no
definition.
mr.
gary
kollin
it
means
actual
use.
mr.
gary
kollin
okay.
well,
it
means
to
use
it,
to
brandish
it,
to
fire
it
as
an
offensive
weapon.
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
also
but
it's
an
offensive
weapon
to
protect
themselves
or...
as
a
weapon
in
the
normal
connotation
of
the
way
the
item
is
used.
as
an
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
let's
say
a
carpenter
is
carrying
a
hammer
on
his
side,
on
his
belt.
and
an
individual
would
go
up
to
the
carpenter
and
say
may
i
borrow
the
hammer.
am
i...
are
you
using
it?
the
carpenter,
while
he
would
be
carrying
the
hammer,
would
say
no,
i'm
not
using
it
now.
you
may
borrow
it.
secondly,
if
the
carpenter
goes
ahead
and
trades
that
hammer
for
a
board,
similar
to
john
angus
smith
trading
the
gun
for
drugs,
we
would
not
say
the
carpenter
used
the
hammer
under
a
normal
way
of
speaking
or
normal
connotation.
we
would
say
the
carpenter
traded
the
hammer.
and
so,
in
regard
to
this
statute,
i
believe
that--
mr.
gary
kollin
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
normal
connotation
of
the
word
use.
i
think
similarly
to
this
situation
is
the
problem
this
court
faced
in
public
citizen
v.
department
of
justice.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
word
utilized...
it's
a
very
similar
word
i
think
to
the
word
uses...
is
a
wooly
verb,
its
contours
left
undefined
by
the
statute
itself,
and
went
through
its
analysis.
and
i
think
similarly
the
word
use
here
has
a
certain
manner
of
uncertainty
to
it,
and
when
it
has
this
manner
of
uncertainty
and
ambiguity
to
it,
then
we
must
resort...
well,
then
we
have
the...
we
look
to
the
legislative
history
and
also
we
can
look
to
the
rule
of
lenity.
and
in
looking
to
the
legislative
history
in
regard
to
this
statute,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
regard
to
this
matter.
the
original
statute...
well,
the...
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
cases
of
simpson
and
busic,
the
legislative
history
in
regard
to
the
statute
was
rather
sparse.
and
in
this
particular
case,
as
presented
in
our
brief,
the
original
bill
in
regard
to
adding
this...
these
provisions
of
924(c)
was
added
on
the
floor
by
representative
casey,
and
in
his
words,
he
said
that
without
the
words...
word
carry
in
it,
that
it
would
apply
to
the
actual
use
of
the
firearm.
and
then
representative
poff
later
proposed
an
amendment,
also
on
the
floor...
and
i
noted
in
both
situations
there
was
a
quorum
present...
that
representative
poff
said
that
his
amendment
to
the
casey
proposal
was
not
in
derogation
of
that.
and
so,
therefore,
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
the
senate
proposal
of
senator
dominick
was
not
accepted,
which
was
instead
of
using...
instead
of
having
the
words
use
or
carry,
they
had
the
word
armed,
that
we
must
distinguish
between
use
or
carry,
and
in
that
situation
looking
at
this
legislative
history,
we
see
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
would
not
encompass
the
word...
would
go
to
its
actual
use
in
its
normal
capacity.
in
our
brief,
we
also
present
what
i
presented
as
the
pawn
ticket
hypothetical...
and
that's
at
page
15...
in
which
we
have
an
individual
who
takes
a
gun
and
several
weeks
before
he
decides
to
engage
in
any
type
of
drug
activity,
takes
the
gun
and
pawns
it
at
a
pawn
shop.
later
on,
he
decides
to
become
involved
in...
excuse
me...
a
drug
trafficking
event,
and
then
trades
the
pawn
ticket
for
the
drugs.
the
government
acknowledges
at
footnote
20
that
perhaps
this
does
not
fall
within
the
normal
understanding
of
the
word
use,
and
i
could
submit
to
you
that
there
could
be
countless
other
situations
like
that,
for
instance,
a
bill
of
lading
for
gun
parts
that
could
be
assembled
into
guns
that
could
be
traded,
or
for
instance,
other
situations
where
an
individual
brings...
is
bringing
home
a
quantity
of
drugs
in
a
large
box,
and
for
some
reason,
the
door
keeps
swinging
shut,
and
there
is
a
gun
lying
there
that
had
no
part
in
the
transaction.
there
was
no
intent
of
being
used
in
regard
to
the
case,
and
takes
that
gun
and
places
it
as
a
door
stop.
and
technically
under
the
wording
of
this
statute,
that
is
being
used
during
and
in
relation
to
the
federal
drug
trafficking
crime.
so,
the
statute
itself
presents
an
ambiguity
and
uncertainty
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
use.
and
accordingly,
we
have
the
right
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
which
i
presented,
and
also
to
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
gary
kollin
to
be
quite
truthful,
justice,
i
have
not
explored
the...
those
aspects
of
section
(g).
mr.
gary
kollin
i
don't
know
the
exact
wording
of
section
(g)--
mr.
gary
kollin
--well,
i
think
that
the
issue
there
is
transfer,
and
the
later
aspect
is
used--
mr.
gary
kollin
--that
is
correct,
but
it
could
be
the
person
could
possibly
charge
with
carrying
the
firearm
under
the
other
prong
of
the
statute.
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
i
think
that
one
of
the
courts
have
held
that
carrying
is
a
very
narrow...
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
carry
is
a
very
narrow
definition
and
use
has
a
very...
has
lost
its
active
connotation.
but
i
think
carry
means
to
possess
in
transit
or
possess
and
transport.
mr.
gary
kollin
not
under
the
definition
that
i've
suggested.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
think
generally
yes,
justice.
i
think
generally
carry
does
have
that
offensive
type
purpose.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary
in
regard
to
reaching
the
decision
in
regards...
in
this
case.
mr.
gary
kollin
no,
justice,
because--
mr.
gary
kollin
--he
was
discharged
under
the
use
prong.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
think
that
was
the
same
question
justice
white
asked
earlier
which
i
agreed
with,
but
for
whatever
reasons,
in
three
superseding
indictments
the
government
chose
to
only
charge
john
angus
smith
with
the
use
of
the
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
the
federal
drug
trafficking
crime.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
agree,
justice,
that
that
requires
that
reasonableness.
in
fact,
that
was
suggested
in
the
footnote
in
the
1984
passage
of
the
bill
in
which
they
talked
about
a
firearm
merely
carried
during
a
pugilistic
barroom
fight.
mr.
gary
kollin
that's
true,
justice.
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
if
there
is
an
ambiguity--
mr.
gary
kollin
--well,
that
goes
to
my...
to
the
next
point
is
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
i
think
it
goes
to...
well,...
perhaps
my
interpretation
of
actual
use
means
use
an
offensive
weapon.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
agree
that
that
is
an
argument
to
be
made
in
regards--
mr.
gary
kollin
--well,
i
think
that
was--
mr.
gary
kollin
--that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
phelps
case
that
was...
the
decision
the
ninth
circuit
turned
on,
which...
but
they
said
that
a
firearm
that
is
traded
in
barter
is
not
used
in
relation
to
the
federal
drug
trafficking
crime,
and
that's
the
decision
they
ruled
upon.
we
are
not
abandoning
that
position,
but
we
feel
that
with
regard
to
the
definition
of
the
word
use,
it
presents
the
ambiguity.
moreover,
if
we
turn
to
the
next
point,
which
is
the
rule
of
lenity,
then
we
have...
where's
there's
ambiguity
exists,
then
you...
the
decisions
are
that
we
adopt
a
construction
most
favorable
to
the
accused.
and
if
we
adopt
that
construction
most
favorable
to
the
accused,
then
in
this
situation
the...
we
would
find
that
there
is
no
violation
on
the
part
of
john
angus
smith
for
bartering
the
firearm
for
the
drugs.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case
it
is
ambiguous,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
gary
kollin
--no.
i'm
saying
it's
ambiguous
because
without
narrowing
the
construction,
we
nullify
the
word
carry,
and
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
that
we
should
never
make
a
word
superfluous
in
a
statute,
and
we
should
give
each
word
effect.
there
is
a
minority
opinion
in
regard
to
the
moskal
situation.
judge
scalia's
position
is
once
there
is
an
ambiguity,
you
don't--
mr.
gary
kollin
--i
understand
that.
[laughter]
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
it's
our
position--
mr.
gary
kollin
--well,
in
the
situation
of
our
hypothetical,
justice
white,
in
which
somebody
trades
the
pawn
ticket--
mr.
gary
kollin
--yes.
mr.
gary
kollin
but...
well--
mr.
gary
kollin
--well,
i
think
it's
different
than...
i
think
that's
different
than
carrying.
i
don't
think
it's
actual
use
because
i
think
we
think
of
the
word
use
in
the
normal
connotation
of
that
item's
utilization.
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
never
ever
traded
it.
so,
he
didn't
get
to
the
situation.
not
only
does
this
definition
establish
the
ruling
for
john
angus
smith,
but
it
established
a
bright
line
for
the
lower
courts
because
as
we...
as
i
talked
about,
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
going
through
this
case-by-case,
situation-by-situation
analysis
to
try
and
determine
the
intent
of
the
person
who
possesses
that
firearm,
has
gone
to
situations
with...
endeavoring
to
presume
an
intent
in
the
person's
mind
in
regard
to
that
possession.
and
it
avoids
that
case-by-case
situation
analysis,
and
it
reduces
the
burdens
to
the
lower
court
by
not
having
to
go
through
those
things,
but
determines
a
bright
line
which
somebody
either
uses
it
or
not
uses
it
and
what
carry
means
under
these
situations.
i
also
submit
that
it's
consistent
with
the
congressional
history
with
regard
to
this
matter.
mr.
gary
kollin
if
barter
constitutes
use--
mr.
gary
kollin
--that's
correct.
mr.
gary
kollin
but
it
still...
as
you
said,
justice
stevens,
it
still
creates
a
fuzziness
that
was
mentioned
in
the
dissent...
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
mewks
and
the
volume
of
cases
that
keep
on
reaching
this
court
about...
in
petitions
for
certiorari
in
regard
to
what
use
is
and
whether--
mr.
gary
kollin
--i
don't
think
that's
true
with
regard
to
anything
in
the
law.
mr.
gary
kollin
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
gary
kollin
well,
i
think
that
the
holding
would
establish
the
bright
line,
and
i
think...
i
do
submit
that
i
think
that
the
congressional
history
is
consistent
with
the
point
that
we
make
that
actual
use
refers
to
something
more
than
just
bartering
or
trading.
in
the
instant
case,
john
angus
smith
did
not
actually
use
a
firearm
in
the
context
intended
by
congress
as
an
offensive
weapon.
this
court
should
determine
that
his
conduct
of
trying
to
trade
the
firearm
for
drugs
did
not
violate
the
use
prong
of
the
statute
because
he
did
not
actually
use
the
firearm
in
its
normal
capacity
as
an
offensive
weapon.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
gary
kollin
--not
in
the
context
that
the
statute
prescribes.
i
think
that--
mr.
gary
kollin
--i
do
not
believe
that's
how
someone
would
normally
say
it.
i
think
they
would
say
i
traded
the
firearm
for
the
drugs.
mr.
gary
kollin
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
gary
kollin
no.
i
think
he...
somebody
could
reasonably
interpret
that
he
pulled
the
board
off
a
wall
by
pulling
out
the
nails.
mr.
gary
kollin
as
express
words
are
placed
in
statutes
and
have
to
be
read
in
their
context,
like
use
or
carry,
involved
in,
or
used
in,
and
not
to
make
other
words
superfluous,
in
these
cases
with
use
or
carry
or
involved
in
or
used
in,
they
are
not
mere
iterations
of
spanning
out
of
different
methods
of
commission
of
the
crimes,
and
we
look
at
them
in
the
normal
parlance.
the
bank
robbery
conspiracy.
yes,
i
would
agree
that
that
is
the
facilitation
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
the
person...
other
persons
would
be
guilty
under
the
concept
of
18
united
states
code,
subsection...
section
2
for
aiding
and
abetting,
just
as
the
theory
was
tried
to
be
made
in
the
busic
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
government
has
been
able
to
establish
any
example
where
someone
can
carry
without
using
under
its
definition
or
the
definitions
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts.
the
problem
with
regard
to
this
definition
is
that
it
criminalizes
the
fact
that
somebody
may
have
drugs
that
are
proximate
to
a
gun
even
where
the
guns
are
inoperable.
there
are
situations
where
guns
were
at
remote
locations
where
the
drug
transactions
weren't
being
committed.
this
also...
this
same
definition
of
use
in
this
statute
also
accomplishes
the
law
enforcement
goal
because
it
still
allows
law
enforcement
to
encourage
the
person
to
leave
the
gun
at
home
because
if
he
is
carrying
the
gun
on
his
way
to
committing
the
crime,
he
is
still
guilty
under
the
statute,
and
therefore
is
the
same
goal
and
same
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
the
examples
in
the
later
1984
statute...
the
versions
talk
about
the
methods
of
using
it
and
they
give
examples
by
pointing
it
out
in
regard
to
the
bank
teller
and
individuals
of
that
nature.
