mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
its
face,
the
language
of
section
924(c)
encompasses
the
use
of
a
firearm
as
a
medium
of
exchange
to
buy
illegal
drugs.
if
i
purchase
illegal
drugs
with
a
$100
bill,
i
have
used
that
$100
bill
to
buy
drugs.
by
the
same
token,
if
i--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
the
word
use
does
not
imply
use
for
a...
for
the
particular
purpose
the
item
was
created
for.
it
implies
any
use.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the
definition
of
the
word
use
encompasses
all
uses.
if
i
use
a
gun
to
pound
a
nail
into
the
wall,
that's
not
the
purpose
for
which
guns
are
designed,
but
i
would
say
in
common
parlance
i
used
the
gun
to
pound
the
nail
into
the
wall.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
purpose
of
the
questionnaire.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
with
respect,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
rule
of
lenity
is
particularly
inappropriate
i
think
to
apply
in
this
case
because
the
conduct
at
issue
here
falls
within
the
literal
definition
of
the
words
use,
within
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
use.
this
isn't
a
case
in
which
we're
arguing
for
something
other
than
the
actual
definition
of
the
words
use.
petitioner
had
fair
notice
that
if
he
used
a
gun
in
relation
to
a
crime,
he
was
running
risks
of
being
incarcerated
for
a
very
long
time,
and
that's
exactly
what
he
did.
this
isn't
the
case
for
the
rule
of
lenity
at
all.
the
definition
of
the
word
use
is
very
broad.
it
means
to
employ,
to
carry
out
a
purpose
or
action
by
means
of,
to
make
instrumental
to
an
end.
congress
chose
not
to
use
specific
narrow
words
like
fire,
shoot,
or
brandish
in
order
to
limit
the
types
of
uses
that
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
instead,
congress
used
sweeping
language
which
suggests
that
it
didn't
intend
the
courts
to
draw
fine
distinctions
among
the
various
ways
in
which
criminals
can
employ
firearms
in
furtherance
of
their
criminal
conduct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
know
why
he
wasn't
indicted
for
carrying
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
out
that
that
would
not
have
alleviated
the
split
in
the
circuits
because
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
the
phelps
case
is
that...
they
conceded
in
the
phelps
case
that
the
defendant
there
had
used
the
gun
by
trying
to
trade
it
for
drugs,
but
what
they
said
was
that
that
use
was
not
in
relation
to
the
drug
trafficking
crime.
so,
they
went
off
on
the
in
relation
to
prong
which,
of
course,
applies
to
the
carrying
of
the
firearm.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
again,
your
honor,
in
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
would.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
under
the
rule
of
the
phelps
case
we
could
not
convict
him
for
carrying
in
relation
to
an
offense
because
what
the
ninth
circuit
in
phelps
said
was
that
trading
of
a
firearm--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--for
drugs
is
not
in
relation
to.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
did
until
the
court
granted
cert,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
think
we
might
well
be
here
because
petitioner
could
have
argued
that
by
holding
that
the
carrying
of
a
firearm
for
the
purpose
of
trading
it
for
drugs
is
in
relation
to
a
drug
offense,
that
would
have
created
a
direct,
square
conflict
with
what
the
phelps
case
said
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
that
the
trading
of
a
gun
for
drugs
is
not
in
relation
to
a
drug
offense.
we
think
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it
would
be
different,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
if
that
statute
doesn't
have
an
in
relation
to
requirement,
there
might
be...
involved
in
might
be
broader
than
in
relation
to,
although
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
be.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
use
implies
some
active...
i
mean,
some
active
use,
not
to
be
redundant,
but
something
could
be
involved
in
an
offense
without
having
been
used
by
the
particular
defendant.
use
implies,
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
charged,
some
ability
to
guide
the
destiny
of
the
gun,
if
you
will,
to
control
the
gun,
at
least
in
the
sense
of
constructive
possession
as
justice
thomas'
opinion
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
long
case
said.
"involved
in"
would
not
necessarily
imply
that.
in
any
event,
it
may
be
that
in
that
statute
congress
was
simply...
again,
similarly
to
what
it
was
trying
to
do
here,
was
using
multiple
words
to
ensure
that
the
statute
would
given
its
full
scope
and
construed
broadly
in
order
to
get
at
the
full
range
of
conduct
that
congress
wanted
to
proscribe.
petitioner
argues
that
our
interpretation
of
the
word
"uses"
renders
the
word
"carries"
superfluous.
we
disagree
with
that.
there
are
certainly
cases
in
which
a
defendant
could
carry
a
gun
without
using
it
in
relation
to
the
crime.
for
example,
a
member
of
a
bank
robbery
conspiracy
who
goes
to
the
store
and
buys
a
gun
and
brings
it
back
and
then
turns
it
over
to
the
member
of
the
conspiracy
who's
actually
going
to
rob
the
bank.
that
individual
has
not
used
the
gun
in
any
way,
but
he
has
certainly
carried
it
during
and
in
relation
to
the
bank
robbery
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
because
he
hasn't
used
it
in
any
way.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
say
that
the
mere
carrying
of
a
gun
without
more
is
the
use
of
a
gun.
the
use
implies--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
i
don't
think
that's
how
we
would
use
the
word
use
in
common
parlance.
if
you
were
using--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
think
when
we
speak
of
common
parlance,
we
speak
of
the
way
words
are
ordinarily
used
which
is
i
think
the
way
the
dictionary
defines
them.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
but
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
use
and
the
common
parlance
use
of
the
word
use
means
to
employ
something,
to
carry
out
some
purpose.
it
doesn't
mean
to
employ
something
only
in
a
manner
for
which
it
is
designed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
but
it
can
mean
that.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
again,
if
i...
if
a
burglar
uses
a
gun
to
break
open
a
window
in
order
to
gain
access
to
a
house,
or
if
he
uses
the
butt
of
his
shotgun
to
smash
open
a
closet
door
in
order
to
ransack
its
contents,
he
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it
can.
i
can
certainly
say
i...
if
i
were
the
burglar
who
smashed
open
the
closet
door
with
the
gun
and
someone
asked
me
how
i
smashed
open
the
closet
door,
i
would
say
i
used
my
gun.
that's
common
parlance.
that's
the
way
the
word
is
ordinarily
used
in
that
context,
and
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
a
narrower
definition.
the
literal--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
it
depends
on
the
crime
being
charged.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the...
it
depends
on
the
predicate
offense
that's
being
charged,
whether
it's
a
use
in
relation
to
the
predicate
offense.
certainly
there's
no
question--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
there
has
to
be
a
use
in
relation
to
a
specific
drug
trafficking
crime.
certainly
the
defendant
has
used
the
gun--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
again,
your
honor,
it
might
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
depending
on
how
you
construe
the
limitation
of
during.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
has
to
be
during
the
commission
of
the
crime,
and
it
depends
on
what
the
crime
charged
is.
if
the
crime
is
distribution
of
cocaine,
which
occurs
at
11
o'clock,
i
don't
think
he
has
violated
the
statute.
but
even
if
he
has...
if
the
charge
is
possession
of
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute
it,
the
presence
of
the
gun
at
the
scene
of
the
cocaine
would
permit
a
jury
to
infer
that
he
is,
indeed,
using
it
in
relation
to
the
crime
and
is,
therefore,
guilty
of
the
crime.
but
it
depends
on
the
predicate
drug
crime
being
charged.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
that's
a
more
difficult
question,
your
honor,
because
many
courts
of
appeals
have
construed
the
use
in
relation
to
requirement
to
require
some
proximity,
some
availability
of
the
gun,
and
it's
unclear
how
that
requirement
would
apply
in
this
context,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
that
you
could
certainly
have--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
that
that
would
be
a
use
in
relation
to
the
crime,
your
honor.
and
again,
there's
nothing
surprising
or
absurd
about
that
result.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
involvement
of
firearms
in
criminal
activity.
and
in
particular,
when
it
amended
the
statute
in
1986
to
extend
the
statute
to
drug
trafficking
crimes,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
did
so
because
of
the
increasing
proliferation
of
machine
guns
and
other
dangerous
weapons
among
drug
trafficking
criminals
and
other
criminals
and
the
dangers
that
posed
to
law
enforcement
officials
and
other
members
of
society.
and
it's
entirely
in
keeping
with
that
purpose
to
construe
the
statute
as
we
would.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
he
were
trading
cocaine
for
guns?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
he
were
intending
to...
he
were
letting
it
be
known
to
people--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it
depends.
it's
a
more
difficult
question
because
we
might
not...
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
we
might
not
say
that
the
drug
seller--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
that
case,
it
probably
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
if
the
drug
dealer
had
no
actual
interest
in
obtaining
the
gun
and
the
person
with
the
gun
who
was
trying
to
buy
the
drugs
volunteered
this,
the
drug
dealer
might
not
be
using
the
gun
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
and
therefore,
the
drug
dealer
might
not
be
himself
liable,
although
he
would
probably
be
liable
as
an
aider
and
abetter
even
under
that
statute.
but
again,
that's
not
this
case
because
in
this
case
it's
perfectly
clear
that,
as
you
said,
the
defendant
was
actually
using
the
gun
in
order
to
get
drugs
and,
therefore,
was
actually
violating
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
pawn
ticket
is
a
particularly
difficult
one
because
a
pawn
ticket,
at
least
normally,
does
not
in
itself
entail
the
right
to
obtain
a
gun.
so,
you
have
to
go
pay
money
for
it.
in
a
sense
it's
sort
of
like
saying
if
you
give
me
the
drugs,
you
can
go
to
the
store
and
buy
a
gun,
and
i'm
not
sure
that's
that
the
use
of
a
gun.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
that
would
be.
again,
that's
further
from...
that's
quite
a
distance
from
this
case
because
there's
no
question
about
constructive
or
actual
possession,
as
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
acquired.
the
gun
here
was
actually
in
the
possession.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
and
again,
there's
nothing
absurd--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
given
the
literal
language
that
congress
has
used,
we
think
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
in
accordance
with
that
literal
language,
as
the
original
sponsor
of
the
statute
indicated,
congressman
poff.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
broader
than
what
petitioner
has
suggested.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
persuade
the
man
who
was
tempted
to
commit
a
federal
felony
to
leave
his
gun
at
home.
congress
didn't
want
guns
involved
in
the
commission
of
felonies.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
again,
that
might
be
a
reason
for
a
court
concluding...
we
don't
think
it
would
be,
but
it
might
be
a
reason
for
a
court
concluding
in
that
hypothetical
that
it's
absurd
to
construe
the
statute
that
way.
but
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question.
this
case
falls
squarely
at
the
core
of
congress'
concern
in
adopting
the
statute.
petitioner
appears
to
concede
that
the
use
of
a
firearm...
that
the
involvement
of
the
firearm
in
this
case
was
in
relation
to
the
predicate
drug
offense,
and
we
agree
that
under
any
reasonable
construction
of
the
in
relation
to
requirement,
it
has
been
satisfied
in
this
case,
despite
the
fact,
as
i
said,
that
the
phelps
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
believe
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
this
constitutes
a
use
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
and
we
submit
that
it
is.
but
in
order
to
uphold
the
conviction,
the
use
has...
in
order
for
the
conviction
to
be
valid,
the
use
has
to
have
been
in
relation
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that
would
be
nice,
your
honor,
but...
and
i
think,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
in
order
to
answer
the
question
presented
as
we
would,
necessarily
the
phelps
decision
has
to
be
overruled.
in
urging
a
narrower
interpretation
of
section
924(c),
petitioner
in
effect
is
asking
this
court
to
rewrite
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
to
construe
the
term
uses
a
firearm
as
if
it
read
uses
a
firearm
as
a
weapon.
in
our
view,
the
statutory
text
forecloses
that
approach.
congress
specified
the
limitations
it
wanted
to
impose
on
the
scope
of
the
statute.
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
firearm
must
be
during
the
commission
of
the
predicate
offense,
and
it
must
be
in
relation
to
the
predicate
offense.
those
two
limitations
do
not
include
the
ones
sought
by
petitioner.
so,
the
obvious
inference
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
adopt
petitioner's
version
of
the
statute.
as
i
was
discussing
earlier,
petitioner
argues
that
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
render
the
word
carries
as
superfluous,
but
in
fact,
that's
not
correct.
if
anything,
it's
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
would
render
a
word
superfluous
because
if
petitioner
is
correct
that
the
statute
applies
only
to
actual
physical
uses
of
firearms
as
an
offensive
weapon,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
one
can
actually
use
a
firearm
as
an
offensive
weapon
without
also
carrying
it.
and
so,
it's
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
runs
afoul
of
the
rule
that
statutes
should
not
be
construed
in
order
to
render
words
superfluous.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
