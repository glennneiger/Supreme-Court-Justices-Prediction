mr.
wright,
i'd
just
like
to
raise
a
question
to
have
you
comment
on
it
at
your
convenience.
i
take
it
your
position
would
apply
to
a
tort
in
outer
space
where
a...
the
government,
through
government
negligence
in
houston
or
someplace,
caused
a
satellite
to
bump
into
someone
or
an
individual
got
injured.
now,
you
would
take
the
same
position
there,
would
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
say
outer
space
is
a
foreign
country.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
on
that
view,
at
least,
this
exception
is
superfluous.
exactly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
you
would
decide
all
the
cases
that
we
hypothesize
the
same
way
under
your
analysis,
whether
or
not
this
exception
were
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
doesn't
really
say...
it
doesn't,
in
so
many
words,
say
that
that
law
applies
to
claims
against
the
united
states.
it
just
says
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
under
the
law
of
the
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
there
another
law
of
the
place
provision
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
the
last
line...
the
last
clause
is:
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable
to
the
claim
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
i
guess
we've
construed
that
as
implicitly
indicating
the
court
should
apply
the
law
of
the
place
when
it's
a
claim
against
the
federal
government,
but
it
doesn't
say
so
in
so
many
words,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
comes
in
the
clause
about
if
a
private
person
would
be
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
it's
inferring...
an
inference.
it
would
expressly
cover
it
but
for
the
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
part
of
your
submission
that
if
a
private
person
sued
another
private
person
in
antarctica,
there
could
be
no
recovery
because
there's
no
law
applicable
to
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what...
what
law
do
you
think
would
apply
in
such
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
assume
there
is
some
law
that
would
apply
to
a
tort
at
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred,
why
doesn't
that
bring
it
within
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the...
what
the
statute
would
be
saying
there
is
if
a
private
person...
the
private
person
there
would
be
liable
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
someplace
other
than
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
oregon
law
would
govern
torts
in
the
place
where
the
act
occurred
for
at
least
oregon
citizens.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
the...
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
in
an
oregon
court
say,
well,
just
as
oregon
would
apply
oregon
law
there,
that's
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
occurred
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
could
say
that
but
it
wouldn't
be
true.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
five
of
us
said
it
was
true.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
just
curious
about
your
legislative
history
point.
the
ambiguity
in
using
is
does
the
use
by
means
for
barter
purposes
constitute
use,
and
the...
you
turn
us
to
the
legislative
history,
and
congressman
casey
said
i
mean
actually
use
a
gun.
well,
actually
use
really
isn't
any
different
from
use.
i'm
not
sure
why
that
clears
up
the
ambiguity
that
gets
you
to
look
at
that.
