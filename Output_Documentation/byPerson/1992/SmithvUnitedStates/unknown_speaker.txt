unknown
speaker
is
the...
does
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
determine
the
law
that
will
be
applied?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
why--
unknown
speaker
thank...
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
--either
the
victim
or
the
criminal.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
your
argument,
yeah.
unknown
speaker
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
then
i
look
at
it
and
i
see
actually
used.
that's
got
the
same
ambiguity.
i'm
actually
using
it
when
i
hand
it
to
you
in
exchange
for
some
prohibited
substances,
am
i
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that...
i'm
just
confining
on
the
legislative...
my
question
really
is
i
don't
see
why
your
legislative
history
argument
advances
us
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
it
just
gets
us
to
where
we
started,
namely,
what
do
you
mean
by
use.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know,
but
the
congressman
didn't
say
that.
he
didn't
say
anything
about
offensive
weapons
or
protective
purpose.
he
just
says
actual
use,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
a
barter
is
a
use,
it's
also
an
actual
use.
i
mean,
you
know,
i'm
just
saying
i'm
not
sure
your
argument
gets
us
anywhere.
well,
if
your
argument
is
it's
ambiguous...
if
use
is
ambiguous,
the
two
words
actual
use
is
even
more
ambiguous.
[laughter]
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kollin,
doesn't
the
language
in
the
statute,
use
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
clarify
it?
it's
use
in
relation
to
the
drug
crime.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
just
use
per
se.
it's
in
relation
to
the
crime,
and
i
suppose
bartering
it
for
drugs
could
be
said
to
be
in
relation
to
the
drug
crime.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
our
moskal
opinion,
mr.
kollin,
we
said
that
a
statute
isn't
ambiguous
for
purposes
of
the
rule
of
lenity
just
because
it's
possible
to
articulate
a
more
narrow
construction.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
you
saying
it's
ambiguous
simply
because
it's
possible
to
articulate
a
more
narrow
construction?
unknown
speaker
yes.
that
didn't
prevail.
unknown
speaker
you
could
just...
you
can
say
that...
you
can
accept
the
fact
that
carrying
doesn't
mean
use,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
bartering
it
for
drugs
is
not
using
it.
unknown
speaker
you're
doing
more
than
carrying
a
gun
if
you
take
it
out
of
your
pocket
and
trade
it
off
for
some
drugs.
unknown
speaker
would
they...
would
the
government
really
have
been
describing
what
happened
if
it
said
this
fellow
was
carrying
a
gun
in
connection
with
a
drug
thing?
what
happened
was
that
he
was...
he
bartered,
he
traded
the
gun
off.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
more
than
carrying
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
actually
using
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
different
from
shooting
somebody.
that's
right.
but
he
has
certainly
got
his
money's
worth
out
of
that
gun.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you're...
let
me
just
challenge
you
on
your
bright
line
argument.
it
seems
to
me
one...
if
we
hold
that
bartering
a
gun
for
a...
drugs
is
use,
that's...
there's
nothing
fuzzy
about
that
holding.
there
may
be
some
fuzziness
out
in
other
cases
about
intent,
but
there's
no
doubt
about
intent
in
the
facts
of
this
case
if
barter
constitutes
use.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
very
clear...
that's
at
least
one
area
of...
that
the
statute
covers
that
everybody
would
understand.
you
can't
trade
a
gun
for
drugs--
unknown
speaker
--without
getting
an
enhanced
penalty.
unknown
speaker
you
think
we
can
fashion
a
definition
of
use
that
won't
have
any
borderline
gray
areas
that
will
produce
litigation?
unknown
speaker
you
would
suggest
that
the
fuzziness
would
be
in
the
reasoning,
not
in
the
holding
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i
shouldn't
have
said
that.
i
said
you
would
suggest
that
the
fuzziness
would
have
been
in
the
reasoning,
not
in
the
holding.
that's
the
one
bright
line
rule.
strike
the
question.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
kollin,
could
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
let's
assume
that
your
client
was
successful
and
was
not
arrested,
and
a
friend
approached
him
the
next
day
and
asked
him
what
happened
to
his
mack
10.
could
he
reasonably
respond
i
used
it
to
obtain
cocaine?
unknown
speaker
but
could
he
respond
to
his
friend
i
used
it
to
obtain
cocaine,
and
would
that
be
a
reasonably
understandable
response?
unknown
speaker
if
he
did
say
that,
might
not
somebody...
if
he
did
say
that
to
you,
wouldn't
you
think
that
what
he
meant
was
he
stuck
it
in
somebody's
face
in
order
to
compel
the
person
to
give
him
the
cocaine?
he
said
i
used
the
gun
to
get
some
cocaine.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kollin.
with
your
carpenter,
if
he
traded
his
hammer
for
the
board,
and
he
was
asked
what
happened
to
his
hammer,
and
he
reasonably...
he
said
i
used
it
to
obtain
this
board,
would
one
reasonably
think
that
he
used
it
to
hammer
someone's
head
to
obtain
the
board?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
pass
on
this
round,
mr.--
[laughter]
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there
is
this
difference.
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
and
printing
$100
bills
is
to
use
them
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
the
purpose
of
manufacturing
and
selling
guns
is
not
to
use
them
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
couldn't
one
define
use
to
be
use
for
the
purpose
that
the
item
was
created
for?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
question
in
the
case,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
hungar,
maybe
our
problem
is
that
we're
focusing
on
the
word
use,
and
words
are
not
used
one
at
a
time.
they're
used
in
phrases.
hence,
there...
you
know,
there
is
a
maxim
of
construction,
notiatur
ex
sociates.
you
know
the
word
from
the
company
of
words
in
which
it's
used.
and
here
we
say
it
says
use
a
gun.
if
you
had
to
answer
a
questionnaire
as
to
whether
you
used
drugs
and
you
were
a
pharmacist...
that
was
your
profession...
would
you
have
to
answer
yes?
of
course,
you
wouldn't,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
because
the
phrase
use
drugs
means
something
even
though
the
word
use
by
itself
can
mean
a
lot
of
things.
and
when
you
say
use
a
gun,
did
he
use
a
gun,
i
don't
think
it
means
did
he
use
it
to
scratch
his
head.
[laughter]
or
did
he
use
it
to
pry
the
door
open?
it
means
he
used
a
gun
as
a
gun.
gee,
i--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
if
you're
working
with
the
doctrine
of
the
rule
of
lenity,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
take
that
into
consideration.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
the
government
avoid
all
this
ambiguity
and
cause
this
split
in
the
circuits?
why
didn't
you
just
indict
him
for
carrying
the
gun
in
connection
with
a
drug
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
wouldn't
have
had
much
problem
indicting...
convicting
this
person
for
carrying,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--i
know,
but
it
didn't
help
you
any
to
use
"use"
either,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
shouldn't
have.
but
if
you
won
in
the
eleventh
circuit
on
the
"use"
theory,
you
certainly
could
have
won
it
on
the
"carrying"
theory.
unknown
speaker
and
we
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
be
here.
unknown
speaker
but
the
issue
would
certainly
be
different
here.
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
hungar,
in
subsection
(d),
the
statute
refers
to
any
firearm
or
ammunition
involved
in
or
used
in
any
knowing
violation.
under
your
definition
in
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
is
there
a
difference
in
involved
in
and
use?
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
offhand
think
of
a
difference
of
involved
and
use
under
your
interpretation,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
interpretation,
at
least
it
renders
involved
in
in
(d)
superfluous.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
hasn't
he
used
it
to
facilitate
the
bank
robbery?
unknown
speaker
sure,
he
has.
he
handed
it
over
to
somebody
and
said,
here,
you
can
use
this
in
the
robbery.
he's
using
it
to
perform
his
act
of
facilitation.
unknown
speaker
because
it
would
just
be
absurdly
broad,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
start
referring
to
common
parlance,
it
seems
to
me
you're
getting
into...
onto
pretty
thin
ice
because
a
minute
ago
you
were
saying,
no,
look,
we're
going
to
use
use
in
the
literal
dictionary
definition.
that's
not
common
parlance.
unknown
speaker
and
doesn't
the
dictionary
frequently
contain
definitions
which
are
at
least
possible
uses
of
the
word,
but
which
do
not
reflect
common,
everyday
usage?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
justice
scalia
suggested
to
you,
when
you
say
use
a
gun,
in
common
parlance
it
doesn't
mean
trading
a
gun,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily
or
even
commonly.
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
what...
you
say
using
a
gun
in
common
parlance
means
opening
a
door
with
it.
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
this
case,
if
you
used
the
gun
at
home
in
order
to
grind
the
powder,
you
used
the
butt
of
the
gun,
and
then
left
the
gun
at
home,
that
would
be
the
use
of
a
gun
in
connection
with
a
drug
transaction?
unknown
speaker
this
charge...
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
under
my
hypothetical,
would
there
be
a
violation
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
he
be
using
the
gun
in
a
drug...
for
drug
trafficking?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
he
grinds
the
cocaine
powder
using
the
butt
of
the
gun,
and
at
11
o'clock
in
the
morning,
he
takes
the
powder
that's
so
created
and
goes
out
and
sells
it.
a
violation
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
how--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
barter
arrangement
was
i
will
mail
you
the
gun
in
exchange
for
the
drugs?
has
he
used
the
gun
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
position
on--
unknown
speaker
--the
meaning
of
the
word
in
relation
to,
and...
the
words,
rather?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
there
was
a
drug
dealer
who
wasn't
so
much
interested
in
money
as
collecting
guns
to
defend
himself
and
his
colleagues,
he
let
it
be
known
that
i
am
trading
cocaine
for
guns.
that
certainly
would
be
using
a
gun?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
could
you
indict
him
who
is...
who...
the
cocaine
dealer.
could
you
indict
him
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
he
wants
the
gun
and
the
gun...
and
he
never
would
have
entered
into
this
drug
transaction
unless
he
got
the
gun.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
suggests,
i
believe,
that
you
would
answer
their
hypothetical
about
the
pawn
ticket
by
saying
that's
use
of
a
gun
too.
unknown
speaker
maybe
change
the
example
to
one
where
he
gave
him
a
bill
of
sale
to
the
gun.
unknown
speaker
that
would
clearly
be--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
really
would
be
use
in
the
same
sense,
consideration
in
an
exchange
for
guns--
unknown
speaker
--for
drugs.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
absurd.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
absurd,
but
that
is
the
scope
of
your
position.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
the
point
of
my
hypothetical
was
he
could
do
that
and
leave
his
gun
at
home.
unknown
speaker
so,
did
you
think
we're...
be
authorized
in
this
case
to
say
that
it
is
in
relation
to?
that
isn't
the
issue
we
took
it
on,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
act
of
offering
a
firearm
solely
as
an
item
of
barter
in
trade
for
drugs
violates
1924(c)
for
use
of
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
felony.
so,
you
can
say
that
certainly
that
question
is
subsumed.
but
you
would
like
us
to...
if
you
win
the
case,
you
would
like
us
also
to
overrule
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
kollin,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
